1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:02,880
Her low freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:03,930
There's that site,

3
00:00:03,931 --> 00:00:06,780
that site that like I go
to sometimes for that like,

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,580
can I handle this that he fucked.

5
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:09,091
You know,

6
00:00:09,091 --> 00:00:09,924
you look at it and you're like,

7
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:11,200
yeah.

8
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,033
Sometimes

9
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,880
people send in their stuff all the
time and sometimes it's like I can,

10
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:17,521
that's crazy.

11
00:00:17,521 --> 00:00:17,811
And it sounds,

12
00:00:17,811 --> 00:00:18,040
I was like,

13
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:18,401
Whoa,

14
00:00:18,401 --> 00:00:18,821
Whoa,

15
00:00:18,821 --> 00:00:19,261
whoa.

16
00:00:19,261 --> 00:00:20,870
I can't handle that next.

17
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:21,930
My butthole pucker.

18
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,330
I do like the Fart stop.

19
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:26,173
Like some guys

20
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:29,210
I got,

21
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:29,401
yeah,

22
00:00:29,401 --> 00:00:33,150
it was a guy and his nose was
where in this girl's butt crack.

23
00:00:33,151 --> 00:00:34,980
And then she saran wrapped his hair

24
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,110
and then she did parents and then she
walked around the kitchen and she was

25
00:00:39,111 --> 00:00:39,540
like,

26
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,670
turn the sink on and
turned to just farting.

27
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:42,963
And he's like,

28
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:44,100
she's like,

29
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:44,481
yeah,

30
00:00:44,481 --> 00:00:45,870
you're like those dirty Fars Huh?

31
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,360
Anything was Saran wrap,

32
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:50,341
like sack lunch,

33
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:50,971
sack lunch.

34
00:00:50,971 --> 00:00:54,180
There's a sky that has Saran wrap
diaper on and he just did the camera,

35
00:00:54,181 --> 00:00:59,181
just pants to him and he spreads his
cheeks and fills it with [inaudible].

36
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:02,210
But it's good.

37
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:02,440
Yeah,

38
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,273
that's good.

39
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:04,683
Just like

40
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,170
I just,

41
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:08,430
it's the sound,

42
00:01:08,431 --> 00:01:09,360
it's the timing

43
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,420
pants and just the right.

44
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:18,270
And then it turns ever so slightly
and the spread and the sound,

45
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:21,570
a woman's farts.

46
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:29,700
We talked about it for a while
and then people wrote in,

47
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,090
people wrote in that were into it.

48
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:31,480
You know,

49
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,313
cause we were like,

50
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:34,051
they were telling us,

51
00:01:34,051 --> 00:01:34,411
they were like,

52
00:01:34,411 --> 00:01:34,830
yeah,

53
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:38,850
it goes back to like a pretty
girl making something dirty.

54
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:39,370
I,

55
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:39,780
it's like,

56
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,100
oh my gosh,

57
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,180
so embarrassed.

58
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,930
So they,

59
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,450
this guy he wrote in that,

60
00:01:45,451 --> 00:01:46,271
he was like my,

61
00:01:46,271 --> 00:01:47,100
uh,

62
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:47,661
now he's grown,

63
00:01:47,661 --> 00:01:50,390
his fiance knows and his colon,

64
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:51,480
like whenever she has to fight,

65
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:53,430
she calls him over and he gets so excited.

66
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,093
He loves it.

67
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:56,990
He loves it.

68
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:58,171
Come on.

69
00:01:58,171 --> 00:02:00,870
How strange or people are so strange,

70
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,870
the variabilities of what
people are attracted to.

71
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:04,860
It's just,

72
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:05,970
it's so bizarre.

73
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:06,900
Yeah.

74
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,720
Well you see like people that are
into people that are so obese,

75
00:02:09,721 --> 00:02:10,920
they can't get off the couch.

76
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,810
There's guys who turned
on by that feeders,

77
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:16,230
feed them,

78
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,350
love their,

79
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,031
watch them.

80
00:02:18,031 --> 00:02:20,820
And then there's girls who they have,

81
00:02:20,821 --> 00:02:21,930
that's a whole business for them.

82
00:02:21,931 --> 00:02:23,940
It's like they set up a
camera and they're like,

83
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:24,410
oh,

84
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,140
eat cheese and cookies the day.

85
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:28,780
And then you just,

86
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,180
you get to watch them,

87
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:30,690
you know,

88
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,070
gaining weight should have done,

89
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,060
that's their whole thing.

90
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:34,323
New Shit.

91
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:36,870
Fucking comedy

92
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:39,980
jokes.

93
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,430
Just shit in bags.

94
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:42,863
Awesome.

95
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:43,901
I just,

96
00:02:43,901 --> 00:02:46,380
the idea of Saran wrap and a guy's head.

97
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,250
You're so great areas.

98
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:48,861
So fun.

99
00:02:48,861 --> 00:02:53,690
So this guy crawling around as she
does her stuff in the kitchen or just

100
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,060
follows,

101
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,340
he needs those like slide or his need.

102
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,780
It's a really good idea.

103
00:02:57,781 --> 00:03:01,370
We should suggest this board maybe
and we've played a lot of uh,

104
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,060
I'm going to email this guy.

105
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:07,600
Why have these Omni Directional sliders
that are work out with I do abs with

106
00:03:07,601 --> 00:03:07,980
them.

107
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,160
You know this slide.

108
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,530
You can do it this way and do
your mountain climbers with them.

109
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,670
I do all kinds of different shit.

110
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:13,241
Yeah,

111
00:03:13,241 --> 00:03:15,280
you can put those on the guy's name.

112
00:03:15,281 --> 00:03:17,230
Just fart or all around the house.

113
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:18,940
Hardwood floor.

114
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,800
Have you seen King Ash reppers work?

115
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:21,620
Um,

116
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,453
excuse me.

117
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:24,540
Pick him up.

118
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:25,573
What is that?

119
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,740
We've reached down a lot.

120
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:28,603
Offered him money.

121
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:29,930
Yes.

122
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:31,940
Just because he's such a creative guy.

123
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,720
When you're talking to me again and maybe

124
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,350
your powers.

125
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,550
King Ash ripper ass ripper.

126
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,170
Yeah,

127
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:40,160
Harry and grows

128
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:43,550
the Lord of all farts and gluttony.

129
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:44,840
He makes videos.

130
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:46,580
No himself.

131
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:48,280
Him King asked her about,

132
00:03:48,281 --> 00:03:49,580
oh please give me some volume.

133
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:53,183
That's still

134
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:56,130
okay.

135
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:56,963
He is moving.

136
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,753
No real.

137
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:02,550
Oh go to ribbon.

138
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,480
Mattson farts.

139
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:03,820
Yeah,

140
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,653
go to ribbon.

141
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,350
Oh cause he has an opus.

142
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:12,560
This is just one of many.

143
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:13,571
But his pants.

144
00:04:13,571 --> 00:04:13,780
Yeah,

145
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:14,613
he does.

146
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,493
It's getting brown.

147
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:27,220
There is 99,000 is how many fucking
standup bits online of 199,009

148
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:39,370
does and eats to glutton.

149
00:04:39,371 --> 00:04:41,630
So He's eating thing.

150
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:47,850
This is like,

151
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:48,081
Hey,

152
00:04:48,081 --> 00:04:48,914
I

153
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:50,970
know about them.

154
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,560
We've studied his work forever.

155
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:59,130
Looking at Brown is getting back there.

156
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:05,160
I obviously isn't making money from this.

157
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:06,810
He should be making millions.

158
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:07,920
Does he have ads?

159
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,090
He's got to be making money.

160
00:05:09,091 --> 00:05:09,401
If it's not,

161
00:05:09,401 --> 00:05:10,200
it's got this.

162
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:10,801
Here's the thing,

163
00:05:10,801 --> 00:05:12,420
what time does he have ads?

164
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:13,231
I liked that.

165
00:05:13,231 --> 00:05:14,750
He's just checking everything else now.

166
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,593
The ads,

167
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:16,890
what's in the microwave?

168
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,790
She likes to stage the scene with

169
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:22,640
what we got

170
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:28,983
and

171
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,950
he's got marks in his underwear drawer.

172
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:41,843
Dude,

173
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,880
he's got some that are so brown.

174
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,081
Clearly.

175
00:05:46,081 --> 00:05:46,914
Shit,

176
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:48,923
here's the car.

177
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,430
Here's a Christmas one too.

178
00:05:50,431 --> 00:05:50,911
Hairy.

179
00:05:50,911 --> 00:05:53,390
Gross Slob is his fucked him.

180
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:54,150
Yeah.

181
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:54,690
He,

182
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:55,291
oh my God.

183
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:55,681
Look at what he,

184
00:05:55,681 --> 00:05:59,840
you fucking videos with hundreds
of what he has to go to.

185
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,220
[inaudible] not much.

186
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,510
Sausage gravy.

187
00:06:02,511 --> 00:06:04,790
Gluck has heel pizza watching
you get to watch a meat.

188
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:06,943
Oh,

189
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:08,443
throw up.

190
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,100
This sounds hard to watch.

191
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:17,620
So I've as coming to the surface is
Christmas one fucking Christmas special?

192
00:06:18,771 --> 00:06:19,060
Yes.

193
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:19,581
Special.

194
00:06:19,581 --> 00:06:20,414
We uh,

195
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,230
uh,

196
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:22,460
we found it on his,

197
00:06:22,461 --> 00:06:23,690
because his live leak account,

198
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:28,880
he has a lot on live leak from youtube
because youtube will take him down so

199
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:29,723
lively.

200
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,593
They,

201
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,150
it's just not apparently.

202
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:32,541
Maybe.

203
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:36,020
I think it gets flagged a
lot on youtube and on lively.

204
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:36,501
It's lively.

205
00:06:36,501 --> 00:06:37,340
It's like bring it on,

206
00:06:37,341 --> 00:06:37,671
dude.

207
00:06:37,671 --> 00:06:38,990
Someone's mom sees it.

208
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,190
What is my son being?

209
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:42,763
Boom,

210
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,760
those mothering mothering.

211
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:50,490
Well,

212
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:52,040
we're talking a lot about,

213
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:52,963
um,

214
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,410
crazy mother's lately.

215
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:54,781
Oh,

216
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:55,970
over-parenting yeah.

217
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:00,050
Well in this case he wasn't
parents in this case,

218
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,990
this guy has got maybe was too much.

219
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,270
Maybe like rebellion,

220
00:07:05,271 --> 00:07:05,451
right?

221
00:07:05,451 --> 00:07:05,780
Yeah.

222
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,920
Hates Mommy magic.

223
00:07:06,921 --> 00:07:08,330
His mom finds out about this.

224
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:14,020
I think he lives at homestyle because
we've studied the videos and it seems as

225
00:07:14,031 --> 00:07:18,350
though these are like prior to that
location there was one that was up just a

226
00:07:18,351 --> 00:07:22,790
bedroom in a basement and I think he
actually did live with his folks and we've

227
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:27,791
deduced that this might be like a fetish
thing because it's gluttony and then

228
00:07:27,951 --> 00:07:32,951
farts and he won't answer
any of my neighbors tweets
or that people just bombard

229
00:07:33,771 --> 00:07:36,890
him with him cause he put an email
in one and we will on our show.

230
00:07:36,891 --> 00:07:39,950
We're like everybody even unlike and no
response know if you could get to the

231
00:07:39,951 --> 00:07:41,540
bottom of this we'd really appreciate you.

232
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:45,560
I don't want to cause I'm terrified one
day he'll be in here and the party in my

233
00:07:45,561 --> 00:07:47,270
fucking Ergonomic chairs,

234
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,291
the family,

235
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:52,400
the family thing also is because on the
Christmas one you can tell it's a family

236
00:07:52,401 --> 00:07:56,240
home and then there's stockings
up and he farts and every stocking

237
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,713
and then he goes,

238
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:01,820
that's what you get from King
ass report for Merry Christmas.

239
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:06,030
Taking ass represents coast
is probably going to die.

240
00:08:06,031 --> 00:08:07,640
You probably have something
wrong with his colon.

241
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:09,110
That's an interesting theory too.

242
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,430
And people have also

243
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,470
brought about the theory that he is uh,

244
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,430
doing that pushing air in there.

245
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,160
You know,

246
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:17,993
you think it's cheating,

247
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:18,671
he's cheating.

248
00:08:18,671 --> 00:08:21,830
I believe that Tom like filling himself
with air and then fighting it cause

249
00:08:21,831 --> 00:08:24,170
there's know edits between each fart.

250
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:24,780
I don't know.

251
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:28,250
I would assume that he can't
fart rapid fire that loud.

252
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,120
I mean you'd,

253
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,580
you'd have to be some sort of bag of wind,

254
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,010
like a bag genius,

255
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:34,933
right?

256
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,380
Cause sometimes mean regular,

257
00:08:36,381 --> 00:08:39,410
fresh like oh little tell me your farts.

258
00:08:39,411 --> 00:08:39,990
Smell like,

259
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:42,120
it sounded like last
night I thought yesterday.

260
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:42,860
I,

261
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:43,071
you know,

262
00:08:43,071 --> 00:08:46,790
when you stay away from seafood for
awhile and then you reintroduce it,

263
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:48,560
there's bacteria in like,

264
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:48,730
you know,

265
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:51,170
it's different since shellfish and Sushi.

266
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:52,243
And I,

267
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:53,511
I thought when,

268
00:08:53,511 --> 00:08:53,860
I guess the,

269
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:57,630
when I farted it sounded somebody was
throwing up like the part sounded like a

270
00:08:57,631 --> 00:08:58,464
guy going,

271
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,091
you know,

272
00:09:00,091 --> 00:09:00,261
I,

273
00:09:00,261 --> 00:09:03,330
I've only shaved my ass once in my life,

274
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,620
but once I did,

275
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,341
oh my God,

276
00:09:05,341 --> 00:09:06,960
my fart sounded so different.

277
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:07,410
Really?

278
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:07,561
No,

279
00:09:07,561 --> 00:09:10,050
they were all like wet and sloppy hair,

280
00:09:10,051 --> 00:09:10,950
kind of different.

281
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:16,640
The hair on your ass literally changes
the way your farts smell or sound rather.

282
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:17,010
Right?

283
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:17,940
Smell this smell the same,

284
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,230
but they sound different.

285
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,833
Plop,

286
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,420
plop,

287
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:23,950
plop,

288
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:24,783
plop.

289
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,850
Something tells me King
Asher but doesn't shave.

290
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,040
That's a whole new area he get into.

291
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:33,190
That's a whole monster.

292
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:35,303
That guy,

293
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,770
she's dating that guy.

294
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:40,060
He doesn't have a
girlfriend or girlfriend.

295
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:45,390
He scrapes up his youtube ad video money.

296
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:46,170
Then.

297
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:49,110
Then he gets a hooker farts on her

298
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:50,850
like,

299
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:51,211
no,

300
00:09:51,211 --> 00:09:52,044
I hate it.

301
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:52,630
He said,

302
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:53,640
you fucking loser

303
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,470
my videos of jewelry.

304
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,440
Willows.

305
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,070
We went to the game,

306
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,913
right?

307
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:02,551
No you don't.

308
00:10:02,551 --> 00:10:03,390
I don't have the Internet.

309
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,253
Shut up.

310
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:07,860
What?

311
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:08,693
The flood.

312
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:11,260
That's someone's babies from
when I was a little baby.

313
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:13,363
Yeah,

314
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,120
they'd be your son.

315
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,953
It could be our son,

316
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:16,640
our son,

317
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,600
my favorite clothes.

318
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,350
Like take the throne,

319
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,053
the new king.

320
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,250
Hail to the new king.

321
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:24,630
I want him to go toe to toe.

322
00:10:24,631 --> 00:10:25,464
I,

323
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,210
I hope he takes it from him one day.

324
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:28,440
Get to the next level.

325
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,870
What is it about Fart?

326
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,100
So there is so hilarious.

327
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,160
They're never not funny.

328
00:10:35,161 --> 00:10:38,040
They're never not entertaining taboo.

329
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,440
You're supposed to do them
in front of strangers.

330
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:41,491
The smell,

331
00:10:41,491 --> 00:10:42,181
the sound,

332
00:10:42,181 --> 00:10:43,500
everything's everything about it.

333
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:45,410
And the people,

334
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,570
the people that love them
versus don't like it.

335
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:50,030
I think that's all rooted in.

336
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:55,040
If your household was okay with
bars are not none growing up.

337
00:10:55,051 --> 00:10:55,884
So that's why.

338
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:56,530
Oh,

339
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:56,881
trash.

340
00:10:56,881 --> 00:10:58,080
So we loved farts.

341
00:10:59,160 --> 00:10:59,520
Farts.

342
00:10:59,520 --> 00:10:59,701
Okay.

343
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:00,930
Was it talked about in your house?

344
00:11:00,931 --> 00:11:01,500
Was it no,

345
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:01,830
no,

346
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:02,580
no.

347
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:05,370
My house was lacking
in any sense of humor.

348
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:07,043
Really?

349
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:07,411
Yeah.

350
00:11:07,411 --> 00:11:08,244
No one was funny.

351
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:08,971
No one,

352
00:11:08,971 --> 00:11:09,640
no one's funny.

353
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,040
No one had any ever.

354
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:12,030
Everyone was like,

355
00:11:12,031 --> 00:11:13,050
don't be a loser.

356
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,430
Stop being a loser,

357
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:15,840
a loser,

358
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,290
dummy.

359
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:16,741
It was always,

360
00:11:16,741 --> 00:11:18,120
you're going to be a loser.

361
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:20,880
You're grade soccer going to be skewed.

362
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,390
I'm still coughing from
the fart sublime parts.

363
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:24,980
Um,

364
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:27,390
I literally almost threw
up when he was eating the,

365
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:31,890
when he was hitting the hot dogs and
sausage and the gravy saliva was coming to

366
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:32,700
the surface in my throat.

367
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,660
Now I'm dealing with right now.

368
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:36,780
He farts on what he's going,

369
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,353
he's

370
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,373
like

371
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,230
little Debbies 12 of them.

372
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:51,090
And then you're like,

373
00:11:51,091 --> 00:11:51,431
all right.

374
00:11:51,431 --> 00:11:52,081
And he turns around,

375
00:11:52,081 --> 00:11:55,720
he's like more fart them any
parts on him and then he eats them

376
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,650
guide to eating some of his own shit.

377
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:03,820
There's a video where he gets up bucket.

378
00:12:03,821 --> 00:12:04,121
Okay.

379
00:12:04,121 --> 00:12:05,680
IFC and dips,

380
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:09,820
every fried piece in Mayo and so horrible

381
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:17,703
Google search.

382
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,553
That guy

383
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:27,370
that's so crazy dies all wrong.

384
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,680
All wrong in every way.

385
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,990
I do kind of look there was a time where
our listeners thought that I might get

386
00:12:32,991 --> 00:12:35,600
him get this away him James,

387
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,420
we're literally almost threw up.

388
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:40,640
There is a,

389
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,291
there is one,

390
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:42,430
we won't describe anything.

391
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:46,210
There's nothing gross about
this description but one
time cause he's a eater.

392
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,440
He's like,

393
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,440
I got eight sausage egg
mcmuffin and then he's,

394
00:12:54,281 --> 00:12:54,550
he's,

395
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:59,550
he's tallying it and he's like D's a 250
calories and then I got egg and cheese,

396
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,030
300 calories.

397
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,090
Nine of those you do the math

398
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,720
because he wants you to know how many
calories he's eating but he's not that

399
00:13:13,721 --> 00:13:14,001
fat.

400
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,010
I just know God.

401
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:16,090
God on him.

402
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:16,241
Yeah.

403
00:13:16,241 --> 00:13:17,074
He's not like he's,

404
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,390
he doesn't have some sort of
Ralphie may thing going on.

405
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:21,100
It's like remarkably obese.

406
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:21,700
Sadly,

407
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:26,700
that guy lives his life like absolute
shit every day and I'm fatter than him.

408
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:31,300
He definitely does not give a fuck ever.

409
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,950
And it was not that out of shape.

410
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,270
But you think that's an act?

411
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:38,350
I mean maybe he's like some customer
service representative for like Toyo Tires

412
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:39,184
or someplace.

413
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,193
I might agree.

414
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,880
Have I not watched many of his films?

415
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,023
Are the data,

416
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,470
the footage for about

417
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,260
like a long time with king,

418
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:51,400
he claims to be in Michigan,

419
00:13:51,401 --> 00:13:51,731
by the way.

420
00:13:51,731 --> 00:13:52,720
He claimed to be a Michigan guy.

421
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:53,800
How long has he been doing this?

422
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:55,203
A few years.

423
00:13:55,510 --> 00:14:00,510
So do you think he tentatively dipped
him his toes into the pool of ass fart

424
00:14:00,971 --> 00:14:03,670
videos or did he just
fucking decide he's the king.

425
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,840
He calls himself.

426
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,640
He's the king from the jump though.

427
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:07,061
I mean,

428
00:14:07,061 --> 00:14:10,690
did you go back to library does
earlier videos where he's like,

429
00:14:10,691 --> 00:14:12,060
I challenge anybody to Fart.

430
00:14:12,061 --> 00:14:12,611
Like I can't.

431
00:14:12,611 --> 00:14:13,444
Like he was really,

432
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,171
he owns it,

433
00:14:14,171 --> 00:14:15,004
you know?

434
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:15,940
Yeah.

435
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:18,040
He's hard on all his haters.

436
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:19,660
He shows his face too.

437
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:19,991
Yeah,

438
00:14:19,991 --> 00:14:22,420
he doesn't want gets recognized.

439
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,250
Do you think that he,

440
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:27,260
like one day he's at golden
corral and then like gets you

441
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:31,930
getting shrimp nibblers I,

442
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,930
I think I'm going to
go out on a limb here.

443
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:39,370
I'm going to go out on a limb and think
and say that I don't know if he's all

444
00:14:39,371 --> 00:14:39,821
mentally,

445
00:14:39,821 --> 00:14:40,151
well,

446
00:14:40,151 --> 00:14:40,984
I think

447
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:43,360
I've taken a big leap.

448
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,910
I think if you do a
project like your king,

449
00:14:45,911 --> 00:14:46,744
and he was like,

450
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,150
oh

451
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,370
my face foreign my face please sir,

452
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:56,020
your grace sat with site.

453
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:58,220
He'll be like,

454
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:58,640
dude,

455
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,830
I could park bigger than
you any day like that.

456
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,071
And you know,

457
00:15:01,071 --> 00:15:01,880
and having to be like,

458
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,713
Oh yeah,

459
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:04,790
I'm the king dude.

460
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:05,420
Name Ms. Dot.

461
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,890
Well what if you can
only fight on his own?

462
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:07,611
What if like,

463
00:15:07,611 --> 00:15:08,450
if you challenge him,

464
00:15:08,451 --> 00:15:09,284
he just locks up.

465
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:11,210
It's interesting.

466
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:11,660
Yeah.

467
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,770
Maybe get stage fright.

468
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:13,971
Wow.

469
00:15:13,971 --> 00:15:15,200
That's why he does it all alone.

470
00:15:15,201 --> 00:15:18,470
And he's kitchen like a stage somewhere
and he doesn't respond to the emails.

471
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,333
Let me ask you this.

472
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:21,260
If that guy put on a show somewhere,

473
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:24,200
like he had a small club in Chicago,

474
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,320
some hundred 50 seater.

475
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:27,050
Yeah.

476
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:28,640
Do you think he could fill a place?

477
00:15:28,641 --> 00:15:29,990
You think you can get a
hundred people in there?

478
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,280
I would endorse people go,

479
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,740
we would push harder.

480
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:33,681
I would buy a ticket.

481
00:15:33,681 --> 00:15:34,491
I can make some money.

482
00:15:34,491 --> 00:15:36,140
If he could fart like that all the time,

483
00:15:36,141 --> 00:15:38,960
we can make some money and that's
why I'd like him to contact us.

484
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,900
We can have him open for your mom's house.

485
00:15:41,901 --> 00:15:42,800
Podcast live.

486
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,190
Yeah.

487
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:43,401
No,

488
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:46,000
you couldn't leave shit on
your fucking microphone.

489
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,200
You want to hear anyway,

490
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,103
sorry.

491
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:51,761
No,

492
00:15:51,761 --> 00:15:54,340
and you'd try to clean
it up and do your show.

493
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,473
Oh,

494
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:58,641
I'm starting to throw.

495
00:15:58,641 --> 00:16:00,200
Everybody would get so upset.

496
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,131
Oh,

497
00:16:01,131 --> 00:16:02,420
we thought it was good to be cool.

498
00:16:02,421 --> 00:16:03,710
It's got shit everywhere.

499
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:17,350
Okay.
