1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,270
Huggers like on an yeah.
I wish because I don't have any need for

2
00:00:03,271 --> 00:00:04,180
the back seat.
Three,

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:05,190
two,
one.

4
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:10,080
[inaudible] he's a gentleman we're going
to fuck with live on the day of net

5
00:00:10,081 --> 00:00:14,070
neutrality.
We might not be broadcasting anymore.

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,440
It might be over.
I don't know how that works.

7
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:18,540
When does it kick in?
Right away?

8
00:00:18,541 --> 00:00:19,710
I Dunno.
I have no idea.

9
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,083
That's a great thing about it.

10
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,680
By the way,
has there ever been in like a harder

11
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:29,680
time to be at citizen?
Meaning like it's just how much I had

12
00:00:29,681 --> 00:00:31,750
never had to pay this much attention.
I know,

13
00:00:31,751 --> 00:00:32,584
right?
Like come on.

14
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:34,960
It's like fucking,
we have to babysit.

15
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,480
It's like their children that we have to
like,

16
00:00:37,481 --> 00:00:38,240
wait,
what are they doing?

17
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,210
No,
like where they used to kind of be able

18
00:00:40,211 --> 00:00:42,610
to take her themselves.
Yeah.

19
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,730
Or seemingly could.
Yeah.

20
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:47,150
There's not one place where you can go
where you can get one.

21
00:00:47,151 --> 00:00:48,810
Ha.
He shaking that before you all.

22
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,620
Should I not checking maniac bro.
I don't care if it's just going to

23
00:00:51,621 --> 00:00:53,330
explode all over the place.
Give it,

24
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,440
let that fucker rest though.
The worst ones are those little small

25
00:00:57,441 --> 00:01:00,110
ones that I have those Cayenne cleanses,
you shake those bitches,

26
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,090
they just fucking shoot up to the
ceiling,

27
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,100
et cetera.
It's all fermented,

28
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,390
so carbonated,
you know?

29
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:06,373
Yeah.
Um,

30
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:11,120
but there's no one source where you can
absolutely get 100% unbiased factual

31
00:01:11,121 --> 00:01:15,140
information as the news,
everything is leaning one way or leaning

32
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:16,460
another way.
And even CNN,

33
00:01:16,461 --> 00:01:19,940
which I used to trust all the time,
they fuck up all the time.

34
00:01:19,941 --> 00:01:21,560
They're always having to print
retractions.

35
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:23,720
There was some thing that was going
around today.

36
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,870
It's just,
there's not one news source where I can

37
00:01:26,871 --> 00:01:28,670
say,
please just give me the unbiased

38
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:30,960
information with no left or right lane.
Yeah,

39
00:01:30,961 --> 00:01:31,650
I get that.

40
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:34,710
Which is hot,
which we talked about beforehand.

41
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:39,030
But when there's
like,

42
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,050
even the idea of the New York Times,
what people don't understand it,

43
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,090
people don't understand journalism a lot
of the time.

44
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,210
Like literally when people go,
oh,

45
00:01:46,211 --> 00:01:47,070
it's fake news.
It's like,

46
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:51,180
you know,
you can't print fake news because they,

47
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,970
you ever,
you ever have anything in the New

48
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,740
Yorker?
You ever be quoted in the New York

49
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:57,570
Article?
I,

50
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:02,630
they literally,
you talk to the journalists then two

51
00:02:02,911 --> 00:02:07,911
different fact checkers call you to
confirm what you said and like,

52
00:02:09,511 --> 00:02:10,920
it's this true,
right?

53
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:12,180
Is that,
and I literally,

54
00:02:12,181 --> 00:02:17,181
this is in an article about someone else
that I gave a quote for and like,

55
00:02:17,851 --> 00:02:19,260
did you say that?
Did,

56
00:02:19,261 --> 00:02:21,150
and you can confirm that.
And they do that.

57
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:24,330
They do that.
It made every major journalistic,

58
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,010
uh,
outfit.

59
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,200
They did the New York Times,
Washington Post,

60
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,960
uh,
like name the big ones.

61
00:02:30,961 --> 00:02:33,570
They all have,
they're not as stringent as the New York

62
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:36,060
as the New Yorker because near her only
comes out once a week.

63
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,940
But they all have fact checkers and they
can get,

64
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,910
and the thing is these institutions can
get sued,

65
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,770
right?
This is not a good example,

66
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,930
but it's,
it's an example.

67
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:49,080
The conor Mcgregor fight New York Times
wrote an article about the conor

68
00:02:49,081 --> 00:02:51,150
mcgregor fight.
And one of the things they said that he

69
00:02:51,151 --> 00:02:55,560
was covered in blood and rescued by the
referee before he fell through the

70
00:02:55,561 --> 00:02:59,350
ropes.
I contacted them on twitter and I said,

71
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:00,010
you in

72
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:04,750
this day and age you can't say things
that everyone knows are false.

73
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,970
Like millions of people watch that
fight.

74
00:03:06,971 --> 00:03:10,260
There was no blood.
He was not falling through the ropes and

75
00:03:10,261 --> 00:03:12,130
the referee rescue them.
You made that up.

76
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:17,140
He was outclassed and battered by a far
superior boxer,

77
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,330
which is what most boxing people
expected.

78
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,440
That's the real story.
Yeah,

79
00:03:20,441 --> 00:03:23,500
but you guys added a bunch of shit to it
so they to shade it,

80
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:24,460
that's for sure.
Yeah.

81
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,780
It's not just shading,
it's,

82
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:27,460
it's a straight lie.
I know.

83
00:03:27,461 --> 00:03:29,980
It's not a cause.
It's not really,

84
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,380
it doesn't,
there's no listen consequential.

85
00:03:32,381 --> 00:03:35,860
It's not a really significant moment.
It's not like a big moment in time and

86
00:03:35,861 --> 00:03:39,040
the result is the same,
but their description of the result

87
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:42,460
makes you wonder how much other things
do you do this too?

88
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:45,490
How many other subjects do you flavor in
this weird way?

89
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,030
Their attraction,
because I remember,

90
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:49,180
I remember seeing you right then I was
like,

91
00:03:49,181 --> 00:03:49,780
oh,
that's cool.

92
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:50,613
Like,
yeah,

93
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,010
and they,
they change it.

94
00:03:52,011 --> 00:03:52,090
Yeah.

95
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:54,730
They were checking they even,
but they still use hyperbole.

96
00:03:54,731 --> 00:03:57,130
Even in their retraction.
They said his face was completely

97
00:03:57,131 --> 00:03:58,300
swollen.
It wasn't,

98
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:01,090
it wasn't a quadrant of his face was
swollen.

99
00:04:01,091 --> 00:04:04,030
A tiny amount and a little bit of
swelling from a boxing match.

100
00:04:04,031 --> 00:04:08,190
Not like,
not some crazy fucking Haseem Rockmont

101
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,010
shit.
Remember that one had an iron on his

102
00:04:12,011 --> 00:04:12,600
head?

103
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,690
Literally the fun,
like maybe the craziest thing I've ever

104
00:04:15,691 --> 00:04:16,380
seen in a fight.

105
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,620
It was this disgusting.
It's huge Hematoma grummond that grown

106
00:04:19,621 --> 00:04:22,830
out of his forehead.
So if you could find that Haseem ragging

107
00:04:22,831 --> 00:04:24,760
on Lennox Lewis,
right?

108
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:25,770
Was it in Lennox Lewis fight?

109
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:26,850
Uh,
yeah.

110
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:29,290
I don't remember.
Um,

111
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:30,870
but yeah,
it was like he,

112
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:32,710
he literally had to go to Dr Pimple
popper.

113
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,080
I'm like a doctor.
People lover.

114
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,780
That's hilarious.
Like that.

115
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,980
That was,
that was wild.

116
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,130
Yeah.
That was an enormous swelling in his

117
00:04:42,131 --> 00:04:45,400
head.
He looks like a war criminal and an

118
00:04:45,401 --> 00:04:48,160
alien.
We did the harder to do.

119
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:49,690
Yeah.
So if that,

120
00:04:49,691 --> 00:04:51,770
you mean that's the,
I don't,

121
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,910
I don't disagree that they do,
they do shade invariably,

122
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:55,980
but shouldn't,

123
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,460
you shouldn't,
you should tell the exact story.

124
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:03,180
That exact story was really clear for
everybody that watched the 2 million

125
00:05:03,181 --> 00:05:05,580
people plus that watched it on paper
view or more.

126
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:09,890
It wasn't something that you can get
away with bullshitting

127
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:11,390
about d.
Okay,

128
00:05:11,391 --> 00:05:14,450
but do you do this wasn't a problem five
years ago.

129
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,140
Do you know what I mean?
Like it wasn't like it wasn't a problem.

130
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:23,170
It wasn't a problem day to day.
And that's the thing that I was yelling

131
00:05:23,271 --> 00:05:28,130
at somebody yesterday of like the uh,
once Pete,

132
00:05:28,131 --> 00:05:30,500
once Fox News created this thing of,
of,

133
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,590
of like,
uh,

134
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:39,260
extremely shaded shit and people saw
that there's a market for it.

135
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:40,070
There were like,
all right,

136
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,900
we'll do that,
we'll do that now.

137
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:45,830
And then everyone's,
everyone's reacting but they don't think

138
00:05:45,831 --> 00:05:46,850
they're reacting.
But,

139
00:05:46,851 --> 00:05:48,590
and now the New York Times is trying to
go the other way.

140
00:05:48,591 --> 00:05:52,670
Where there they hired this guy,
bret stephens to write op ed pieces.

141
00:05:52,671 --> 00:05:54,350
And every week there's a new,
like,

142
00:05:54,351 --> 00:05:56,690
what did you just say?
Like the hill.

143
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:58,340
Yeah.
They're trying to be like,

144
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:03,940
they're trying to be a kind of moderate
or see both sides and a lot of people on

145
00:06:04,521 --> 00:06:05,241
the left are gone.
Like,

146
00:06:05,241 --> 00:06:09,660
but that's how are you seeing both sides
to like slavery or how we're using like

147
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,470
the fuck you talking about?
Like what's both sides of the climate

148
00:06:12,471 --> 00:06:16,130
change?
It's all their scientists and not

149
00:06:16,131 --> 00:06:18,710
scientists.
That's like those the sides.

150
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:21,230
So why are you,
this is basically appeasement,

151
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,920
I guess as a,
as a,

152
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:25,670
uh,
you know,

153
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,170
consumer,
this stuff.

154
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:29,560
It's,
it's,

155
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,820
when I was to get into this
conversation,

156
00:06:31,821 --> 00:06:34,190
I wasn't even talking about journalism.
I was talking about government.

157
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:39,110
I was talking about the amount of
fucking work it takes just to be like

158
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,380
too,
like I can worry about statutes and

159
00:06:42,381 --> 00:06:46,010
fucking the FCC and fucking,
uh,

160
00:06:46,011 --> 00:06:49,340
executive orders and just like,
I never had to do all this.

161
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:53,660
Like why is this so much?
I don't know if it's,

162
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,460
I mean they would say like,
you know,

163
00:06:55,461 --> 00:06:58,820
to be an active democracy,
it's only as good as citizens and all

164
00:06:58,821 --> 00:06:59,654
that shit,
but,

165
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,160
but it seems like we're all more
involved and it's worse.

166
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,880
You know what I mean?
Like it's like it's way more upsetting.

167
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:13,010
It's constant upset.
Like it feels like havoc every single

168
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:13,740
day.

169
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:17,230
Well it's,
it's definitely not good and it's,

170
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:22,320
especially from the environmental side,
whenever a president is shortsighted

171
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:24,550
about the environment,
that scares the shit out of me because

172
00:07:24,551 --> 00:07:26,950
that has repercussions for generation
upon generation.

173
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:29,170
Yeah.
And he's doing it for short term money

174
00:07:29,171 --> 00:07:30,004
grabbing.
Yeah.

175
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:34,860
I like the EPA being essentially gutted
what they're doing in Alaska where

176
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:38,380
they're making roads and they're setting
up mines,

177
00:07:38,381 --> 00:07:41,980
knew the salmon fisheries where their
monuments monuments.

178
00:07:41,981 --> 00:07:44,350
Yeah.
It's scary because it's just,

179
00:07:44,351 --> 00:07:47,290
they're just chopping away,
just chopping away and the repercussions

180
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:49,840
could be forever.
We have an amazing system here in this

181
00:07:49,841 --> 00:07:54,000
country in terms of like the amount of
public land that we have and the

182
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,320
beautiful places where you can go and
check out.

183
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:01,860
All it takes is one or two assholes that
have a mine one on one or two assholes

184
00:08:02,111 --> 00:08:05,200
that allow drilling for oil in these
places.

185
00:08:05,201 --> 00:08:07,240
All they,
all they have to do is extract resources

186
00:08:07,241 --> 00:08:10,210
from these public places and we're
fucked.

187
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,290
And those places are ruined forever.
Not just for your kids but for your

188
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:15,910
grandchildren.
For everybody.

189
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,640
Yeah.
It's like I hope he like equipment cause

190
00:08:18,641 --> 00:08:20,910
there's gonna be a lot of fucking
equipment of these places.

191
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,660
Now.
That's the thing that I,

192
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,600
that curious about,
uh,

193
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,350
people that voted for trump.
Like is this what you wanted?

194
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:31,450
Like honestly,
like want a democrat?

195
00:08:31,451 --> 00:08:32,171
Yeah,
I know,

196
00:08:32,171 --> 00:08:34,660
I know.
I have a feeling I have a notion that

197
00:08:34,661 --> 00:08:36,700
they,
they didn't like,

198
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,280
they felt excluded by like elitism and
going to Davos in the hamptons and all

199
00:08:42,281 --> 00:08:46,840
these places and like the Aspen ideas
festival and Ted talks and all this

200
00:08:46,841 --> 00:08:47,710
shit.
So it's like,

201
00:08:47,711 --> 00:08:48,550
Hey,
fuck you.

202
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:52,240
But this is a,
which I get the notion of fuck you like,

203
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,220
but this is like,
dude,

204
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,040
you tell me that

205
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:01,040
Obama stressed you out on this level.
Like the level of trump stress that like

206
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:05,340
is just created in the culture.
That's what I was saying.

207
00:09:05,341 --> 00:09:09,600
Like it's havoc every day.
It's like a fucking melee.

208
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,740
But do you feel the stress every day?
Do you,

209
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,860
I mean,
are you like,

210
00:09:13,861 --> 00:09:16,920
do like there are days where I'm like,
I can't look at my phone.

211
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,590
I literally can't,
like a couple of days ago I was looking

212
00:09:19,591 --> 00:09:23,310
at something and it was the,
it was maybe before that,

213
00:09:23,311 --> 00:09:24,510
maybe two,
three days ago.

214
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,990
There are days where it's so,
uh,

215
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:33,470
it's so like,
like in the red for like cultural or

216
00:09:34,201 --> 00:09:35,790
political toxicity.
Then I'm just like,

217
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:36,451
Jesus,
I'm like,

218
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:37,860
yeah,
this doesn't,

219
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:41,700
this is like inducing cortisol.
I think that's a good argument also to

220
00:09:41,701 --> 00:09:44,790
stay the fuck away from the news and
social media for a few days a week.

221
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,400
Yeah,
there've been a few.

222
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:49,980
You see the people past couple of days
that like facebook exact span.

223
00:09:49,981 --> 00:09:50,940
Like we've,
we've,

224
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,890
uh,
kind of torn society apart.

225
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,470
Didn't mean to,
whoops.

226
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:57,330
Yeah,
I saw that one facebook exact was

227
00:09:57,331 --> 00:10:00,540
apologizing for what they've done.
They've essentially engineered people to

228
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:01,560
be programmed.
Yeah.

229
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:02,431
Yeah.
I mean,

230
00:10:02,431 --> 00:10:04,770
we've,
we've essentially engineered this thing

231
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,230
or you're going to be addicted to it.
You're going to be tuning into it

232
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,550
constantly and the things that are gonna
attract you the most,

233
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,360
the things that freaking the fuck out.
So that's going to take prominence.

234
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:13,780
Yeah.
Uh,

235
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:14,680
but that,
you know,

236
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:19,200
there's a market that's definitely part
of the market,

237
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,700
but yeah,
it's just,

238
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:25,320
it's a bad idea to have a popularity
contest to see who controls the news.

239
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,960
It's a terrible idea.
And that's what we have.

240
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:32,190
And this is,
this is a real example of an old system

241
00:10:32,191 --> 00:10:33,750
that really shouldn't exist anymore.

242
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:36,020
I had an idea that a couple of weeks ago
that it was like,

243
00:10:36,021 --> 00:10:41,021
I got to run that by joe as like a
jumping off point for conversation robot

244
00:10:41,821 --> 00:10:43,230
president.
Ooh.

245
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:45,660
Do you know what I mean?
Yeah.

246
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,690
Like logical,
super logical here.

247
00:10:48,691 --> 00:10:50,520
Logic,
stats,

248
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,740
no emotions,
no emotions.

249
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,990
Uh,
takes all of history.

250
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:57,060
Human,
his other 2000 recorded history,

251
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,170
2000 year,
what are,

252
00:10:58,171 --> 00:11:01,620
you know,
really 200 years but like,

253
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,370
and takes it all into account.
Even takes literature into account.

254
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:07,530
Hmm.
Like plots,

255
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:10,560
like take Shakespeare.
No account takes plots,

256
00:11:10,561 --> 00:11:11,071
you know,
Hammer,

257
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:12,030
the ava,
all that shit.

258
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:17,540
And then wouldn't that,
isn't that kind of what you want?

259
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,500
Yeah.
Like in that kind of what you want.

260
00:11:19,501 --> 00:11:20,550
And even if,
if,

261
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:24,600
if they say,
if the robot President says I've come to

262
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:27,120
this decision,
it was 55,

263
00:11:27,121 --> 00:11:31,410
45 in favor.
Cause that's all like the older you get.

264
00:11:31,411 --> 00:11:33,060
I'm not a hundred percent anything.

265
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:38,130
Like even though I really love Louise
Joke in his last special,

266
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:40,860
um,
which weirdly didn't make any top 10

267
00:11:40,861 --> 00:11:42,500
list for the year.
Um,

268
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:45,840
I'm one of those weird things.
I listened to it on the plane back from

269
00:11:45,841 --> 00:11:47,580
Hawaii a couple of weeks ago.
I'm great.

270
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,970
It's great.
The last I watched it actually the last

271
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,710
few bits.
We're fucking killer.

272
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:57,790
Just kill out the one about the
fingering and the Magic Mike.

273
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:58,331
Yeah,
yeah,

274
00:11:58,331 --> 00:11:59,000
yeah.
The family.

275
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,620
Mine was great and the Finger Magic
Mike,

276
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,350
my bidding put,
damn it.

277
00:12:02,351 --> 00:12:04,610
That fucking made me laugh.
Made me laugh.

278
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:07,900
So God damn hard.
I mean this is months ago.

279
00:12:07,901 --> 00:12:09,340
This was before we knew anything about
the guy.

280
00:12:09,341 --> 00:12:10,940
I did it right after I knew about them.
Yeah,

281
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,260
of course.
Uh,

282
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:14,260
but,
uh,

283
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,100
but,
uh,

284
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,960
Louie did the thing about,
uh,

285
00:12:16,961 --> 00:12:18,580
abortion that he opened,
whether it,

286
00:12:18,581 --> 00:12:19,750
he's like,
if you,

287
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:24,460
they think they're killing babies,
I'd be out every day if that's what I

288
00:12:24,461 --> 00:12:24,860
thought.

289
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:25,510
Right.
I don't,

290
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:29,140
I just don't see it that way.
But it's the idea of like,

291
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:34,380
there's so many debates that people
won't admit any doubt about like an 80,

292
00:12:35,771 --> 00:12:38,350
20,
20% abortion,

293
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:39,363
you know?
Eh,

294
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:42,580
I wouldn't,
I would have one probably.

295
00:12:42,581 --> 00:12:44,680
I've never,
never had the privilege.

296
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:47,110
Uh,
I've never needed to get one,

297
00:12:47,111 --> 00:12:49,720
but like I,
and I think if other people want to get

298
00:12:49,721 --> 00:12:50,554
one,
cool.

299
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,180
But I,
but at the same time,

300
00:12:52,181 --> 00:12:54,460
I see when I see what your argument is.
Yeah.

301
00:12:54,461 --> 00:12:55,620
I see both sides.
Yeah.

302
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:58,270
I think there's a certain time where
it's a baby,

303
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,740
you know,
a certain,

304
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:01,180
I mean,
certain amount of months in,

305
00:13:01,181 --> 00:13:01,901
we're like,
okay,

306
00:13:01,901 --> 00:13:04,150
you're killing a baby now.
I don't know when it is,

307
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,390
but I know what it is either.
But I,

308
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,740
it's gotta be at some point tell you
what,

309
00:13:08,741 --> 00:13:12,430
it's not the first day when it's like
two cells claiming together and they

310
00:13:12,431 --> 00:13:13,420
become four cells.

311
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,010
Just get rid of the cells.
And that's a wrap.

312
00:13:15,011 --> 00:13:17,770
But you would even admit like I or maybe
it is,

313
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,330
maybe it is.
Yeah.

314
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,920
Maybe it is.
I don't,

315
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,080
I personally don't.
I'm not a scientist.

316
00:13:23,081 --> 00:13:25,170
I'm not a,
I'm not a uh,

317
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:26,350
uh,
uh,

318
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:30,250
obstetrician.
But if we had,

319
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:34,850
uh,
like a soul meter in the room and uh,

320
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:39,190
like you woke up one day and your wife
was pregnant and it's like 48 days in

321
00:13:39,191 --> 00:13:39,670
honey,
honey,

322
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:41,350
look at the sole meter.
There's a new,

323
00:13:41,351 --> 00:13:42,940
so like,
Whoa,

324
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,770
Yay.
No turning back now.

325
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,330
Now it's an insole.
Yeah.

326
00:13:46,331 --> 00:13:49,180
Before then it was just like a nesting
area.

327
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:53,440
Like they were ready.
It was a prepping area for a new soul.

328
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:55,570
You believe in,
that's at 48 days.

329
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:58,550
You're at one day.
There's no soul if you,

330
00:13:58,551 --> 00:13:59,950
if you had a meter,
right.

331
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:01,940
If you had a way,
obviously we done this in a world where

332
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:05,350
the robot president and a soul mate and
this is all also in a world where would

333
00:14:05,351 --> 00:14:08,140
they proven the existence of the soul,
which is just theoretical.

334
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,580
Right.
But if you could,

335
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:13,510
if you had like a thing in the room with
you sorta like when you have a pregnancy

336
00:14:13,511 --> 00:14:16,720
test or you check like look at this,
it's registering,

337
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:20,020
it's real.
It's happening like a a sole meter.

338
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:22,180
Yeah.
So you have a countdown.

339
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:23,860
Okay.
It says I'm pregnant,

340
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:27,910
we have 47 days or were pieces of shit.
Yeah.

341
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,360
Because once the soul comes in
[inaudible] yeah.

342
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:34,210
Then then we're murderers I guess.
Something like that.

343
00:14:34,211 --> 00:14:35,200
Yeah,
for sure.

344
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,900
Yeah.
But and there are people that believe

345
00:14:37,901 --> 00:14:38,980
it's day one,
which is like,

346
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:41,110
I can understand how you think that.
I don't,

347
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,120
I don't even,
not even,

348
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:45,400
I wouldn't even say I don't believe
that.

349
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,190
I just don't know.
I just have no,

350
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,020
I don't have any feeling one way or the
other.

351
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,400
If you interview,
if you don't interfere with the process

352
00:14:52,401 --> 00:14:56,780
from day one and it goes all the way
through term,

353
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,800
you have a human.

354
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:00,260
Yeah.
So how can you make the argument that if

355
00:15:00,261 --> 00:15:01,520
you do interfere,
it's nothing.

356
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:03,500
Yeah.
It seems like you're stopping a

357
00:15:03,501 --> 00:15:05,010
potential human,
something's,

358
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,320
something's happened.
Right.

359
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:07,890
But it's the,
it's the,

360
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:11,890
the foolishness of going like I am
absolute.

361
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,730
Yeah,
absolutely.

362
00:15:13,731 --> 00:15:17,420
Anything.
And just the reductionist idea of it

363
00:15:17,421 --> 00:15:21,550
being just a bundle of cells too.
That's so sort of preposterous to like,

364
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,210
no,
it's a bunch of cells that will be a

365
00:15:23,211 --> 00:15:28,010
human being.
So you can't just deny the potential.

366
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:30,810
I'm not saying that a bunch of cells,
it,

367
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,530
I don't think it's any different than,
I mean,

368
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:35,540
I think if you can show me for sure that
it's four cells,

369
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:39,770
I think it's a complete total non issue.
It's when you get into three months,

370
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,470
you know,
two months in three months and I'm like,

371
00:15:42,471 --> 00:15:42,981
Whoa,
okay,

372
00:15:42,981 --> 00:15:44,090
what is this?
Yeah.

373
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,400
What is again,
as a baby,

374
00:15:45,401 --> 00:15:46,220
you,
yeah.

375
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,660
To you.
That's your barometer.

376
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,400
Yeah.
But that's the thing I was saying is

377
00:15:49,401 --> 00:15:53,360
like there's no,
you're not allowed to have a nuanced

378
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,100
opinion anymore.
You just have to be like,

379
00:15:55,101 --> 00:15:57,400
no,
I am absolutely eh,

380
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,180
I,
you must believe all women.

381
00:15:59,181 --> 00:16:02,270
Did you see that thing I posted the
other day about it was,

382
00:16:02,271 --> 00:16:06,020
uh,
the me too backlash is going to come.

383
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:06,861
No,
I didn't.

384
00:16:06,861 --> 00:16:08,960
And uh,
how's it going to cut?

385
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:13,280
What kind of backlash?
The backlash is the,

386
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:15,380
on the on campus thing,
the,

387
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:18,620
the basically like the Obama
administration and Joe Biden,

388
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:21,980
uh,
recommended these guidelines for title

389
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:25,020
nine and uh,
and they,

390
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,170
so they recommended these guidelines for
title nine,

391
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:30,320
uh,
the basically protecting women on

392
00:16:30,321 --> 00:16:32,300
college campuses.
But the problem is

393
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:38,030
they throw out due process.
Like literally if a guy,

394
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:41,130
the idea is if your kid,
if you get a Qs,

395
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:43,820
you're basically convicted,
guy gets accused,

396
00:16:43,821 --> 00:16:48,050
he's thrown out of school and it's like,
well that's not due process.

397
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:50,150
There were all these things that were
like,

398
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,000
like I'd never thought about before.
Like,

399
00:16:53,001 --> 00:16:55,600
cause I,
I want to believe all,

400
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,570
you know what I mean?
Like I,

401
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:58,730
I want to believe it.
If a woman,

402
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:01,490
I don't believe women have much reason
to lie about the shit.

403
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:02,440
See what?
That's not not

404
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,090
true.
I don't believe that at all because I

405
00:17:04,091 --> 00:17:08,020
believe there's a lot of women that have
grudges and they're angry and they want

406
00:17:08,021 --> 00:17:10,930
to make things up about man.
And I know men where that's happened too

407
00:17:10,931 --> 00:17:13,360
before.
I know men who have been falsely accused

408
00:17:13,361 --> 00:17:16,870
of rape and the one that dropped it and
told the police that she was just mad at

409
00:17:16,871 --> 00:17:18,760
him and she would,
she had a vendetta.

410
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:20,710
That happens.
It doesn't happen a lot.

411
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,520
I know.
I don't think it'll ever actually,

412
00:17:23,521 --> 00:17:26,110
victor,
I just think that it's a minor.

413
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:29,920
I think it's just an [inaudible] or not.
Anthony Kumi has said something that's

414
00:17:29,921 --> 00:17:30,520
really,
and he goes,

415
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:35,520
he goes calling all women liars is just
as crazy as saying all women to say the

416
00:17:35,681 --> 00:17:36,514
truth.
Right?

417
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:37,450
Yeah,
that's true.

418
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:40,630
You're going to have a certain
percentage of human beings that are

419
00:17:40,631 --> 00:17:43,150
deceptive,
which is why I say 97% of women are

420
00:17:43,151 --> 00:17:44,350
life.
Ah,

421
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:45,490
no.
I think it's,

422
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:46,781
I mean,
I don't want to,

423
00:17:46,781 --> 00:17:48,910
I don't even want to speculate about
what the stats are.

424
00:17:48,911 --> 00:17:50,460
The is if you're a person

425
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:53,430
who didn't do anything to someone and
then they're accusing you of doing

426
00:17:53,431 --> 00:17:54,870
something to them and then it ruins your
life,

427
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:57,360
that's devastating.
And that happens.

428
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:02,340
So I been having this conversation.
I posted it and I put on twitter,

429
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:03,750
Hey,
if I'm wrong,

430
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,700
if this is wrong,
yell at me here.

431
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:09,270
Go ahead.
And I was surprised by how few people

432
00:18:09,271 --> 00:18:12,360
yelled.
No one really got mad because when you

433
00:18:12,361 --> 00:18:17,361
see what the recommendations were,
people believe in due process and the

434
00:18:17,461 --> 00:18:18,520
rule of law,
they should.

435
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,880
And they,
people know that mob mentalities are not

436
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,150
good and they're not American.
I mean they're not the spirit of

437
00:18:27,151 --> 00:18:27,984
America.
They're there.

438
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:30,560
They are pretty American actually,
but like the,

439
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,450
they're not the letter of America.
Um,

440
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:38,930
and it was kind of baffling that Obama
and the administration,

441
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:43,920
so what's happening is,
so guys are getting kicked out of

442
00:18:43,921 --> 00:18:44,170
school.

443
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:46,020
They're getting,
you know what these,

444
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:47,970
they're there,
the colleges are following the

445
00:18:47,971 --> 00:18:52,770
guidelines and uh,
two processes thrown away.

446
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:55,140
Guys get thrown out of school to Dah,
Dah,

447
00:18:55,141 --> 00:18:55,590
Dah,
Dah.

448
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:58,170
And then they sue the school and guess
what?

449
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,970
A lot of them are winning.
Yeah.

450
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,220
Because it's unconstitutional what the
school did.

451
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:05,910
So it's this weird thing of,
uh,

452
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:09,720
it's such a fucking sticky situation
because I was taught,

453
00:19:09,721 --> 00:19:11,520
because the,
after I posted,

454
00:19:11,521 --> 00:19:16,521
a few female friends of mine texted or
called me and one of them said,

455
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:22,330
uh,
that she was at Nyu and was having sex

456
00:19:22,891 --> 00:19:25,920
with a guy.
He tried to,

457
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:28,200
uh,
put it in her ass.

458
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:29,460
She was like,
no.

459
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,170
She said No.
He said,

460
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:32,610
can I?
She said No.

461
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:35,940
Um,
and he did anyway,

462
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,720
she just froze and was like stunned,
frozen,

463
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:42,780
silent.
He finishes no alcohol.

464
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,240
No,
it's,

465
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,510
and it just becomes,
he said,

466
00:19:45,511 --> 00:19:47,940
she said,
and it's like,

467
00:19:47,941 --> 00:19:52,740
what,
what should we do in a society about a

468
00:19:52,741 --> 00:19:55,080
situation like that?
And I truly don't know.

469
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,420
I truly am like,
I have no fucking idea.

470
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,950
Well,
if she said no and he did it anyway,

471
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,440
that's a real fucking problem.
Yes,

472
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:04,470
exactly.
That's right.

473
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:05,880
Yeah,
that's right.

474
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,140
But,
but what,

475
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:11,670
but also then it just becomes what it's
a,

476
00:20:11,671 --> 00:20:14,250
he said,
she said thing there's no,

477
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,820
and she said,
no,

478
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:17,730
we,
you know what I mean?

479
00:20:17,731 --> 00:20:21,450
Like he real lie detectors.
I mean that's really the situations like

480
00:20:21,451 --> 00:20:23,400
this where it's one person's word
against the other and the,

481
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,830
yeah,
the results critical.

482
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,980
You gotta I dunno if that's really
possible though.

483
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:31,590
I mean,
I don't know of anything that exists or

484
00:20:31,591 --> 00:20:34,500
any technology that's on the pipeline.
There's no,

485
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,230
there isn't.
So a friend of mine jokingly said that,

486
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:38,203
that,
uh,

487
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:41,520
all guys and women need to wear body
cams.

488
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:43,630
Like cops.
Yeah.

489
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,410
Yeah.
That's kind of where it is.

490
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,370
Because again,
it is one of the like,

491
00:20:48,371 --> 00:20:51,970
Shit I don't,
cause it might be you kind of think

492
00:20:51,971 --> 00:20:53,020
like,
oh yeah,

493
00:20:53,021 --> 00:20:53,920
no,
it's probably,

494
00:20:53,921 --> 00:20:54,780
it's always pretty cut and dried.

495
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:54,970
It,
it,

496
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:55,710
it,
uh,

497
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:57,490
uh,
and then you hear a thing like that and

498
00:20:57,491 --> 00:20:58,870
you're like,
you know what?

499
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,360
I don't know what to,
but then no one's going to shoot that

500
00:21:01,361 --> 00:21:04,510
guy get to be on camera.
Right.

501
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:10,020
Uh,
the now we're into like,

502
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,490
because I go,
oh guys shouldn't get kicked out of

503
00:21:12,491 --> 00:21:14,590
school.
There should be due process.

504
00:21:14,591 --> 00:21:17,830
Of course there should be due process.
Then I hear a story like that and I'm

505
00:21:17,831 --> 00:21:19,480
like,
fuck man,

506
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:20,680
I don't know.
I don't,

507
00:21:20,681 --> 00:21:22,570
maybe that guy shouldn't be able to go
to school.

508
00:21:22,571 --> 00:21:23,650
I don't know.
I truly,

509
00:21:23,651 --> 00:21:27,070
I don't know.
So he lied and he said that didn't

510
00:21:27,071 --> 00:21:28,120
happen.
He didn't,

511
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:30,190
she didn't press charges or anything.
Okay.

512
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,270
Okay.
Um,

513
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,710
which by the way,
it's super common.

514
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:36,580
So when you take into account rape,
the number of rapes that get reported

515
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:39,100
versus the number of rapes that don't
get reported,

516
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,200
it's like it's a drop in the bucket.

517
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:41,981
And,
and when,

518
00:21:41,981 --> 00:21:42,820
when guys go,
well,

519
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:44,740
why don't girls report it?
Dude,

520
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:49,830
you don't like going to jury duty and
that's a week you want it.

521
00:21:50,501 --> 00:21:53,710
You think a girl wants to talk about her
fucking vagina for a year and a half.

522
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:56,890
Not just that,
the stigma of running around knowing

523
00:21:56,891 --> 00:22:00,040
that everybody knows you were raped.
Like having that feeling where people

524
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:03,790
are judging you or staring yes.
Talking about you for nothing that you

525
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:04,624
did.
No.

526
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:08,470
It's like literally as these things
happen,

527
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:10,270
uh,
because you read these,

528
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,120
the,
a lot of the times the,

529
00:22:12,121 --> 00:22:15,160
the,
it feels like the choice for women is as

530
00:22:15,161 --> 00:22:16,780
it's happening.
It's like,

531
00:22:16,781 --> 00:22:19,060
fuck,
I have to make my life about this now.

532
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:22,420
My whole life has to be about this for
at least a year and a half.

533
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,490
Cops,
lawyers,

534
00:22:24,491 --> 00:22:25,650
fucking,
uh,

535
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:31,050
court dates all just like a nightmare
nightmare that you likely did.

536
00:22:32,261 --> 00:22:33,460
Nothing wrong.
Right?

537
00:22:33,461 --> 00:22:35,530
And you're just,
and now it's like getting,

538
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:40,400
it's like getting an a in a horrible car
accident or something that,

539
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,930
and again,
I don't know what the solution is

540
00:22:46,931 --> 00:22:49,690
because as a comic,
my first and being contrary and I go

541
00:22:49,691 --> 00:22:49,921
like,
well,

542
00:22:49,921 --> 00:22:50,800
what did you,
what did they do?

543
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,640
What do they do?
All the,

544
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:52,750
all the things.
And it's like,

545
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:57,550
no,
most of these things are a wrong place

546
00:22:57,551 --> 00:23:00,940
at the wrong time with a piece of shit.
Yeah.

547
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:03,850
Yeah.
I mean,

548
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:09,010
due process is significant though.
It's gigantic.

549
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:12,730
I know I to have it,
I know happened with the Uva case in

550
00:23:12,731 --> 00:23:16,420
Rolling Stone magazine.
They printed this stupid fucking lie,

551
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:21,750
this crazy story that really becomes a
problem because there's real rape going

552
00:23:22,751 --> 00:23:25,430
on all the time on campuses.
That's happened.

553
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,400
I for that that girl wasn't raped.
The UVA store.

554
00:23:28,401 --> 00:23:30,760
Yeah.
I believe that she was raped.

555
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:32,310
I don't think,
uh,

556
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:36,910
it was the 15 like the way something
happened,

557
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,920
something you sure?
What do you mean?

558
00:23:38,921 --> 00:23:40,730
What do you think that,
because I think they paved that she

559
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:43,260
wasn't even there and that she was never
in there.

560
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:47,710
There was no water or any of that shit.
Me Maybe then it maybe didn't read out

561
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:48,880
any follow up.

562
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,620
I think the significant,
there's,

563
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:54,010
there's so much evidence pointing to the
fact that it was all made up.

564
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,320
Yeah.
That does very little possibility that

565
00:23:56,321 --> 00:23:58,990
something actually happened to her.
I think they've completely dismissed

566
00:23:58,991 --> 00:24:01,000
that.
I think they think it was just a girl

567
00:24:01,001 --> 00:24:04,330
just made some crazy shit up versus the
mattress girl thing.

568
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,780
The mattress girl one was a weird one
because she definitely had sex with that

569
00:24:07,781 --> 00:24:09,760
guy and she definitely wanted to have
sex.

570
00:24:09,761 --> 00:24:13,210
That guy cause she was messaging him
about sex and about,

571
00:24:13,211 --> 00:24:16,150
you know,
I think she said something about bring

572
00:24:16,151 --> 00:24:20,050
condoms and you're going to put it in my
butt and just a bunch of crazy shit.

573
00:24:20,051 --> 00:24:21,760
Like it was sex talk back and forth.
Yeah.

574
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:27,240
And then she just decided this is an
amazing way to be a martyr and to be a

575
00:24:27,911 --> 00:24:30,310
victim and to bring that fucking
mattress everywhere,

576
00:24:30,311 --> 00:24:32,380
including at a commencement speech.
Yeah.

577
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:33,580
You know,
I mean that,

578
00:24:33,581 --> 00:24:36,550
that's a different sort of case that kid
is now suing.

579
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,430
That kid is now suing the university and
I hope he wins.

580
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,900
Yeah.
I again,

581
00:24:40,901 --> 00:24:45,901
I hope he wins and because I think due
process is as important.

582
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,940
It's literally a tie for first between,

583
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:50,243
uh,

584
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,110
protecting women and protecting the
constitution.

585
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,250
Um,
but

586
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:57,541
yeah,
I,

587
00:24:57,541 --> 00:24:58,890
I don't even the,
the,

588
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:03,950
the thing that bothers me about even
talking about Uva or Colombia is it

589
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,110
makes the story about lying women,
right.

590
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:10,430
Which is just fucking,
not that they're the outliers.

591
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:11,960
Yes.
There are the outliers,

592
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:14,030
uh,
by an extreme because there are the

593
00:25:14,031 --> 00:25:17,240
outliers must be able to come forward
ration when you can't just completely

594
00:25:17,241 --> 00:25:18,580
ignore them in the equation.
Right?

595
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:21,880
Well that's the why you need to process
that is exactly what you need.

596
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,930
And you know,
we also have to stop thinking of it as

597
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,450
like men and women.
It's human beings,

598
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:29,510
human beings involved in these
situations and we have to treat them

599
00:25:29,511 --> 00:25:31,640
like equals.
Do you know the story about Occidental?

600
00:25:31,641 --> 00:25:33,520
Occidental College in La?
Uh,

601
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,460
I've,
which story?

602
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:38,000
Boy and girl get drunk,
text each other back and forth.

603
00:25:38,001 --> 00:25:39,470
I'm coming over.
Do you have condoms?

604
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:40,520
Yeah,
come on over.

605
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,160
She comes over there where they have sex
with each other.

606
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:46,190
Um,
and then her friends convinced her that

607
00:25:46,191 --> 00:25:49,550
because she was drunk,
she could not consent and that it's

608
00:25:49,551 --> 00:25:50,091
rape.
You know what?

609
00:25:50,091 --> 00:25:51,920
Remember that was a big thing for awhile
that you,

610
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:53,390
if you're not drunk,
you can't consent.

611
00:25:53,391 --> 00:25:56,610
And it was like for a year or two they
tried to push that until they realize,

612
00:25:56,611 --> 00:25:58,340
oh my God,
that makes everyone a rapist.

613
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,030
So they can mean,
having said that,

614
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:06,060
I think that the part that alcohol plays
in this shit giant is so fucking massive

615
00:26:08,561 --> 00:26:10,960
and nobody ever brings it up as giant.
Yeah.

616
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:13,180
If,
if alcohol was complicit in all the

617
00:26:13,181 --> 00:26:16,120
things that people did while drunk,
the same way that prescription drugs,

618
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:16,990
yeah.
They'd be out of business,

619
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:20,830
out of business.
So this guy and this gal have some sex

620
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:23,860
and it's consensual 100%.
But after the fact,

621
00:26:23,861 --> 00:26:26,770
her friends tell her you couldn't
consent because you were drunk.

622
00:26:26,771 --> 00:26:28,720
Yeah.
So even though he was drunk too,

623
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,220
so,
um,

624
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:33,980
people get told,
the authorities get involved.

625
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:35,660
He gets kicked out of cool out of
school.

626
00:26:35,661 --> 00:26:39,020
She does not,
they just said they don't call it rape.

627
00:26:39,021 --> 00:26:41,840
They don't press charges.
He didn't do anything actually wrong,

628
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,063
you know,
in terms of the,

629
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:44,220
of the law,
since

630
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,650
they're both intoxicated in willing and
consensual,

631
00:26:46,651 --> 00:26:49,500
but they kick him out of college.
And so he's like,

632
00:26:49,501 --> 00:26:50,460
well,
what the fuck man,

633
00:26:50,461 --> 00:26:52,680
she's drunk too,
so I got raped as well.

634
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:56,550
Do you understand that you can't just be
the man that is doing the raping if

635
00:26:56,551 --> 00:26:57,910
you're both intoxicated?
Yeah.

636
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,820
How the fuck am I supposed to be able to
consent?

637
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:04,970
So the idea is that this is as much of a
male versus female thing.

638
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,660
I had a conversation with a female
friend of mine recently,

639
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:14,110
and the conclusion,
one of the conclusions was men don't see

640
00:27:14,571 --> 00:27:18,740
women as humans.
Whoa.

641
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,940
Meaning there?
And while they are here,

642
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:21,813
they're like,

643
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:23,860
okay,

644
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,300
let their other,
yes,

645
00:27:25,301 --> 00:27:27,490
there it's other,
it's other.

646
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:31,180
It's like you're not,
I'm not saying you're not a human,

647
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:33,460
but you're not a man.
I,

648
00:27:33,461 --> 00:27:36,640
you know what I mean?
Like there's some thing of like the way

649
00:27:36,641 --> 00:27:41,641
men treat women is not equal.
It's just so it's other,

650
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:44,320
it's like you're in this other category,

651
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,840
don't understand them that much because
they're not one of them.

652
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:47,830
Yep.
And,

653
00:27:47,831 --> 00:27:49,090
uh,
if they don't have a good relationship

654
00:27:49,091 --> 00:27:50,380
with her mother,
it's even worse.

655
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:53,080
And especially if they were raised by
their dad alone,

656
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:55,030
those guys are the sketchiest guys of
all.

657
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:56,770
Yeah.
I'm generalizing.

658
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:58,840
I can't even think of one guy like that,
but yeah.

659
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,760
I don't think I know when it goes like
that,

660
00:28:00,761 --> 00:28:01,594
but yeah.
Um,

661
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:03,420
I know a guy like that.
Uh,

662
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:06,820
and sometimes even guys that were only
raised by their mom or sketchy if their

663
00:28:06,821 --> 00:28:08,560
mom hates women.
But the,

664
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:11,110
the whole thing is,
I mean,

665
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:14,260
look,
it's just real hard when you start doing

666
00:28:14,261 --> 00:28:16,060
this men and women thing,
right?

667
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:16,980
Cause you're,
you,

668
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:19,510
you're prone to generalizations.
Just no getting away from it.

669
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:24,190
But men want sex from women,
so they pursuing women.

670
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:26,860
And do you have,
do you know any men that are,

671
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:30,700
that you're friends with that you see
over time to become more and more bitter

672
00:28:30,701 --> 00:28:34,150
towards women because they be getting
rejected over and over and the associate

673
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:37,630
women with bad feelings.
You Associate Women with negativity.

674
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:42,070
I think men look at women like,
like they're trying to score on a team,

675
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:43,540
Huh?
Yeah,

676
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:45,550
it's dude,
it's first base,

677
00:28:45,551 --> 00:28:46,570
second base,
third base.

678
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,650
It's literally like built into the
language of how we,

679
00:28:50,651 --> 00:28:54,850
it is a thing that guys conquer.
So it ends up being,

680
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:56,453
uh,

681
00:28:56,910 --> 00:29:00,010
I,
I liken it in the past to like Saudi

682
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:04,510
Arabia or like fucking towel heads,
but because they won't give us the

683
00:29:04,511 --> 00:29:05,860
fucking oil,
right?

684
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:06,580
Like,
no,

685
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,740
it's there.
They don't like you.

686
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:11,660
They don't want to give you like they
don't what they are,

687
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:15,550
but that doesn't mean that they're
shitty any more than it means your

688
00:29:15,551 --> 00:29:18,380
shitty.
If you don't want this fucking Kombucha,

689
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:20,370
it like you just don't,
your body didn't want it.

690
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,380
It doesn't mean that her body doesn't
want you like theirs,

691
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:27,190
but it makes guys,
it hurts their feelings and it makes

692
00:29:27,191 --> 00:29:27,690
them crazy.

693
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:30,990
And it also deals with these
evolutionary mechanisms that are

694
00:29:30,991 --> 00:29:33,120
designed to make sure that we breed.
You know,

695
00:29:33,121 --> 00:29:36,630
it becomes like a significant issue for,
you want to figure out how do I get this

696
00:29:36,631 --> 00:29:39,360
gal to like me to the point where she
wants to have sex with me.

697
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:40,530
Oh,
I got to buy the right cars.

698
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:42,250
I got rather where the right watch.

699
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:46,060
I got to do this and do that and say the
right things and be a gentleman and hold

700
00:29:46,061 --> 00:29:47,920
open doors and all these things that we
do.

701
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:48,431
They're like,
well,

702
00:29:48,431 --> 00:29:50,290
why don't men hold open doors do have to
be a gentlemen.

703
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,320
No t did show that there are
preferential mate.

704
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,480
That's what they're doing.
They're trying to con you.

705
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:57,190
Correct.
And to taking that Dick.

706
00:29:57,390 --> 00:29:58,040
Yes.
The,

707
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,990
it's goes to,
speaks to your bit about invention.

708
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,010
Uh,
the thing that,

709
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:07,020
that your invention thing now is that
the reason,

710
00:30:07,021 --> 00:30:11,220
the thing of like why women have an
advantage because they don't have to,

711
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,670
they don't have to,
it's also the way their mind works,

712
00:30:14,671 --> 00:30:16,730
you know,
the hunter gatherer mindset,

713
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,750
it's very,
very different with the females and the

714
00:30:18,751 --> 00:30:20,770
tribe versus the males.
And we're stealing,

715
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:22,260
still dealing with the echoes of all
that,

716
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,030
by the way,
for people that are,

717
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:25,710
uh,
shallow.

718
00:30:25,711 --> 00:30:29,340
We're talking about misogyny right now.
Just so you know,

719
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:33,360
we're talking in theory about misogyny
and these are not views that either of

720
00:30:33,361 --> 00:30:34,110
us home,
but uh,

721
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:35,070
yeah.
But,

722
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:35,730
um,

723
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:37,080
in fact the opposite.
I mean,

724
00:30:37,081 --> 00:30:38,670
I,
and I have all daughters,

725
00:30:38,671 --> 00:30:41,040
you know,
I'm used to being around little girls.

726
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:45,330
I know,
I know about women more now and

727
00:30:45,331 --> 00:30:46,620
understand them than I ever did.

728
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:51,600
And how would you,
how would you,

729
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:55,560
how different would your behavior have
been 20 years ago if you had what you,

730
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:58,260
the wisdom you have now from having a
way different,

731
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:02,290
it would be way different.
I just would maybe might behave.

732
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:05,020
I never did anything horrible.
Um,

733
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,740
like my record is clean.
Yeah,

734
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,700
no,
I'm not talking about assault,

735
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:14,940
but what I am,
what I am more aware of now is the inner

736
00:31:15,071 --> 00:31:19,810
workings of like a female from child to
adulthood.

737
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:25,080
I understand that they're just so that
there's a different evolutionary path

738
00:31:26,231 --> 00:31:28,330
for their sex,
for their gender.

739
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:32,230
There's a whole thing going on that they
want to protect the nest.

740
00:31:32,231 --> 00:31:34,600
They want to find a man.
Like there's a lot of guys that look at

741
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:37,480
a girl who wants a successful guy like,
oh,

742
00:31:37,481 --> 00:31:39,910
she's fucking shallow.
She just wants a bunch of shoots.

743
00:31:39,911 --> 00:31:44,290
You want someone to pay for everything.
But there is a evolutionary path where

744
00:31:44,291 --> 00:31:49,150
the woman is looking for a man who shows
that he is capable of taking care of

745
00:31:49,151 --> 00:31:53,740
things while she is held up being
pregnant and taking care of the young.

746
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:57,700
It is a natural instinct.
It is undeniable and there are some

747
00:31:57,701 --> 00:32:01,510
women that are super strong and super
motivated and they don't have that

748
00:32:01,511 --> 00:32:04,060
instinct.
Their instinct is to just have a kid,

749
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:06,400
give it to a nanny,
get back to work as quick as possible.

750
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,350
What I'll tell you what,
I bet their husband's tall.

751
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,860
You know what I mean?
There's still those things of like the

752
00:32:12,861 --> 00:32:17,060
evolutionary shit that you can't get rid
of your body and wants to fuck a tall

753
00:32:17,061 --> 00:32:19,880
guy for the same,
for protection,

754
00:32:19,881 --> 00:32:20,530
all that shit

755
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:24,640
for all that shit.
Money tight strength provision.

756
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:25,820
Yeah.
And,

757
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:30,070
and the ability to overcome significant
situations.

758
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:33,970
Like whenever there's a,
like a God that falls apart under stress

759
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:36,580
is one of the most unattractive things
to women ever.

760
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:39,410
Oh yeah.
There was a study where like that I

761
00:32:39,411 --> 00:32:40,100
think winning,

762
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,120
I have talked about,
uh,

763
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:44,540
where guys,
women don't like when guys cry in front

764
00:32:44,541 --> 00:32:46,280
of them.
They say they want an emotional guy.

765
00:32:46,281 --> 00:32:49,370
What they mean is I want you to listen
to my emotions.

766
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:54,300
I don't want you to be emotional.
I need you to be a fucking marine and

767
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,390
you're going to be emotional and cry
about things.

768
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:58,910
It better be like a brave display of a
emotion.

769
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:01,140
One of your fallen brothers.
Yeah.

770
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,140
Uh,
yeah.

771
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,140
There's somebody,
you know,

772
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,880
like a baseball players retiring
something,

773
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:09,800
some physical,
some physical thing about the passage of

774
00:33:09,801 --> 00:33:11,390
time in brotherhood.
That's it.

775
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:12,830
Yeah.
Maybe that's it.

776
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:15,530
That's my daughter's birthday party.
You're so happy.

777
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,760
Yeah.
That's the,

778
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:19,490
that's the portfolio.
Yeah.

779
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:22,820
Um,
but the ability to respond to pressures,

780
00:33:22,821 --> 00:33:25,970
a giant one,
the ability to provide is a giant one.

781
00:33:25,971 --> 00:33:29,330
Physical features like having strong
features,

782
00:33:29,331 --> 00:33:30,800
but having strong genetics.

783
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:34,700
The woman has to know,
like genetically has to feel like she's

784
00:33:34,701 --> 00:33:37,610
being protected.
And then there's some women that don't

785
00:33:37,611 --> 00:33:40,280
like that at all.
There's some women that like bitch men

786
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:42,630
and we know those women and they,
they,

787
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:46,520
they're the really domineering,
powerful women and they have these men

788
00:33:46,521 --> 00:33:50,500
that are like quiet and there's sort of
tiring.

789
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:52,570
Yeah.
I mean that's,

790
00:33:52,571 --> 00:33:55,010
that's okay too.
But these,

791
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:59,150
these patterns that exist,
they exist because for the longest time,

792
00:33:59,390 --> 00:33:59,781
I mean,
look,

793
00:33:59,781 --> 00:34:03,200
it's a weird situation where a woman has
to be pregnant for nine months.

794
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:06,620
That's a long time.
Imagine picking a man.

795
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,590
Imagine if you're,
you're a man and you're picking a woman

796
00:34:09,591 --> 00:34:12,480
and you have to decide when you're
meeting this woman is this chicken to be

797
00:34:12,481 --> 00:34:14,990
able to keep it together with me while
I'm held up,

798
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:20,200
literally held up for a year,
like a whole year for one year I'm going

799
00:34:20,681 --> 00:34:25,681
to be stuck in this situation and then
from then the next 18 years I'm going to

800
00:34:25,941 --> 00:34:29,510
be responsible for the infant that comes
out of this union.

801
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:32,060
Like that's,
that's so different than our thought

802
00:34:32,061 --> 00:34:33,860
process.
It's so different.

803
00:34:33,861 --> 00:34:38,180
The consequences are smashed.
Men only think about it.

804
00:34:38,181 --> 00:34:40,730
To me,
men want sex.

805
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:44,140
They don't think about,
they literally and then it's just blah

806
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:45,650
and then it's just black.
Sure.

807
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:48,320
It's like sex and then just like black
into the distance.

808
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:50,870
Infinite blackness.
Whereas women do things,

809
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:55,900
which is why it's a,
it's a more intricate decision having

810
00:34:56,151 --> 00:34:59,510
sex with somebody cause it is like the
long term shit.

811
00:34:59,511 --> 00:35:03,380
Where's we'd just like,
we just want the baby comes out of this.

812
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:05,580
I'm not even,
that's the one I'm looking for.

813
00:35:05,581 --> 00:35:07,520
That's when I'm just looking to come.
Yeah.

814
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:10,430
Yeah.
Women are looking for sex too,

815
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:13,970
but they also,
a good percentage of them at least are

816
00:35:13,971 --> 00:35:17,930
looking to be a mom.
It's just something that they want.

817
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,060
It's a lot of,
there's a reason why there's 7 billion

818
00:35:20,061 --> 00:35:22,340
people.
It's not because being a mom is so

819
00:35:22,341 --> 00:35:24,140
completely unattractive,
they want to do it.

820
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:27,200
We,
I want to talk about some of the stuff,

821
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:30,740
uh,
with the sexual harassment stuff is the

822
00:35:30,741 --> 00:35:33,860
stuff that people are not,
it's like the alcohol thing,

823
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:38,100
right?
Like I've never thought

824
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,840
drinking around your coworkers was
smart.

825
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:42,030
No,
I have like literally I'm like,

826
00:35:42,031 --> 00:35:47,031
why the fuck would you want I wrap
parties I tried to get out of as soon as

827
00:35:48,031 --> 00:35:48,940
possible.
Yeah.

828
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:53,990
I'll say for like a beer and then,
and I don't even understand the why a

829
00:35:54,301 --> 00:35:57,990
company would have it.
Why would like,

830
00:35:57,991 --> 00:36:00,000
I mean to keep morale.
Yeah.

831
00:36:00,001 --> 00:36:03,050
They're not thinking in terms of the,
you know,

832
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,460
potential hazards.
You're just thinking,

833
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:06,540
oh,
it'd be fun,

834
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:10,020
fun way for everybody to cut loose.
A buddy of mine's producer of a show and

835
00:36:10,021 --> 00:36:12,210
he and he basically a couple of weeks
ago,

836
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:15,450
it was like,
we need to have rules for engagement.

837
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:20,480
So he's made it so like there are going
to be no meetings where there's only two

838
00:36:20,671 --> 00:36:22,230
people.
Wow.

839
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:23,340
Shit.
Like where it's like,

840
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:23,621
no,
no,

841
00:36:23,621 --> 00:36:23,761
no,
no,

842
00:36:23,761 --> 00:36:24,481
no.
Everyone,

843
00:36:24,481 --> 00:36:26,100
you and a dude.
Uh,

844
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:27,000
I think,
yeah,

845
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:30,330
I think there cannot be,
um,

846
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:33,900
I think two dudes can meet.

847
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,410
What about Kevin Spacey to,
uh,

848
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:37,410
Yeah.
Again,

849
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:38,570
that's just trying to go.
No,

850
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:39,450
I know.
Again,

851
00:36:39,451 --> 00:36:42,480
which is why he was like,
where is it three people,

852
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:45,840
but he's the perfect example because
like he's just trying to come.

853
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:46,750
Yeah,
no,

854
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:50,850
a girl text me the other day talking
about how Kevin Spacey harassed her.

855
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:52,480
Really?
Yep.

856
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:54,900
Yes.
He's trying to fuck women too.

857
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:56,970
He just wanted that.
He'd like the power.

858
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:02,130
He liked the action it seems like.
That's interesting.

859
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:03,510
Yeah.
Did you ever see his brother?

860
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:04,950
No.
Oh Man.

861
00:37:04,951 --> 00:37:07,590
It's a trip.
His brother dresses like a combination

862
00:37:07,591 --> 00:37:12,591
of Ringo Starr and Elton John and just
does a completely out there guy and just

863
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:18,231
talks about the Harz of Kevin growing up
with is insanely abusive dad.

864
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:21,410
And it was Kevin's dad too.
Like yeah,

865
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:25,980
I've never even heard of the guy rape
and just awful things.

866
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:27,930
Just awful,
awful abuse.

867
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,550
Well yeah that was like the same as
brother.

868
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:30,520
Wow.
Yeah,

869
00:37:30,521 --> 00:37:32,100
it was brother dresses like that all the
time.

870
00:37:32,101 --> 00:37:34,470
Like a Rod Stewart's brothers,
Ron Wood.

871
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:36,960
My goodness.
Yeah.

872
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,510
Wow.
Yeah.

873
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:43,940
That's his brother and it's just,
they just got fucking abused when they

874
00:37:45,511 --> 00:37:49,680
were children.
Just fucking abuse monster created them.

875
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:51,500
Yeah,
that's what uh,

876
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:55,230
what's his name?
Morgan spurlock yesterday talking about,

877
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,140
did you see his thing?
I heard about it.

878
00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:00,600
I heard about this morning.
You should read it because it's like

879
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:04,650
pretty like he,
he owns up to stuff,

880
00:38:04,651 --> 00:38:08,310
which I get that impulse cause cause I
had,

881
00:38:08,311 --> 00:38:11,640
when I don't have any big stains on my
record,

882
00:38:11,641 --> 00:38:14,350
but I'm like,
well he had an attempt,

883
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,190
well he had someone accused him of rape
in college.

884
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:19,380
Yes.
And he also settled with a girl at work

885
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:20,390
with,
cause he called her,

886
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:23,370
she'll harass pants or hot pants.
That's whatever.

887
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:24,660
Everybody,
yeah.

888
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,370
And then,
but he was like,

889
00:38:26,371 --> 00:38:30,720
I basically would just,
he did it like at saks pants,

890
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:33,180
uh,
like a cross in front of everyone.

891
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:36,070
And uh,
so she was quitting.

892
00:38:36,071 --> 00:38:38,740
She basically said like,
I'm going to tell people,

893
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,540
right,
you call me socks pass.

894
00:38:40,541 --> 00:38:41,590
Yeah.
Yeah.

895
00:38:41,591 --> 00:38:43,070
You can't do that,
but you can't,

896
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:48,460
like in fashion,
everybody sort of puts their excuse and

897
00:38:48,461 --> 00:38:50,330
the confession or a lot of people do.
Um,

898
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,420
it's like the,
it's the,

899
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:56,770
it's kind of like the,
I have daughters thing as a father of

900
00:38:56,771 --> 00:38:57,604
daughters.
Yes.

901
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:58,840
Oh,
um,

902
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,570
well in that case,
well now I understand.

903
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:06,880
So I worked hard and that he was abused
and that he's an alcoholic and all this

904
00:39:06,881 --> 00:39:08,470
stuff that was like,
ah,

905
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:09,940
yeah.
I don't know,

906
00:39:09,941 --> 00:39:10,310
man.
It's,

907
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:12,280
maybe that's a different statement,
right?

908
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:15,250
It's no one will just go like,
I fucked up.

909
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:18,670
Right.
Hate admitting that they were wrong.

910
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:21,700
Like just going like,
I'm a hundred when p even in these,

911
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,600
in these,
uh,

912
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:26,050
apologies goes for the people.
I may have damaged,

913
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:27,610
there's no may.

914
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:31,250
You did it,
it happened like the,

915
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:32,830
the,
there's no,

916
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,650
I don't know if they do it for legal
reasons,

917
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:41,410
but a lot of the time it's like I,
for any anguish I may have caused,

918
00:39:41,411 --> 00:39:45,130
what do you do that puts it on them
where it's like,

919
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:48,370
you know,
you did it depending on what the action

920
00:39:48,371 --> 00:39:49,180
is.
Right.

921
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:51,640
So like if he's talking about the rape
in college,

922
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:53,050
you know,
you read the story,

923
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,520
what,
how the way he wrote it,

924
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:56,590
it's like,
okay,

925
00:39:57,010 --> 00:39:59,860
you kind of did it when she said don't
do it.

926
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,650
So it seems like,
and then she started crying and I don't,

927
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,640
the way he told it.
Yeah,

928
00:40:05,641 --> 00:40:06,690
it's not,
that's not,

929
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:10,570
it's like it
again,

930
00:40:10,571 --> 00:40:14,320
this is like goes to that rules that the
rules and I've been doing this joke on

931
00:40:14,321 --> 00:40:15,140
stage,
which is the,

932
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:17,980
um,
I have a nightclub or Jane that I do

933
00:40:17,981 --> 00:40:18,450
Joe.

934
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:19,250
Well,
um,

935
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:22,380
usually got to come see it to you.
[inaudible] tonight.

936
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:23,860
I'd love for you to come.
In fact,

937
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,570
would you like to introduce me?
Oh my God.

938
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:27,070
Um,
I do.

939
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,330
Uh,
but I do,

940
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,850
sex is the most consequential thing we
can do with our bodies.

941
00:40:30,851 --> 00:40:33,810
So we can't talk about it beforehand.
So we just have to get like,

942
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:35,290
man,
are you thinking what I'm thinking if

943
00:40:35,291 --> 00:40:40,060
I'm wrong and going to jail sweet.
Like it's this huge thing,

944
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:44,890
but we can't talk about it.
But it wasn't a huge thing in terms of

945
00:40:44,891 --> 00:40:48,280
like the communication aspect of it.
Until recently.

946
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:53,110
I mean in the 1970s in 1986 people did a
lot of talking before they fucked.

947
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:54,030
No,
I,

948
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:58,840
but I also think that there were women
didn't have as many rights.

949
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:01,210
I think now that women are like,
wait a minute,

950
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,250
women want sex too,
right?

951
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:05,410
Three man,
when we met each other and they start

952
00:41:05,411 --> 00:41:07,450
making out and next thing you know,
they're grabbing,

953
00:41:07,451 --> 00:41:09,580
Dick says,
I'm of the mind though,

954
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:10,720
that,
uh,

955
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:12,970
were women.
Uh,

956
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,270
it's in,
in,

957
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:18,580
in my understanding of women's nature
that Faye want mystery and they want

958
00:41:18,581 --> 00:41:22,030
spontaneity as part of the package of
sex.

959
00:41:22,031 --> 00:41:23,980
That's,
that's what literally turns them on.

960
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:25,540
Um,
mystery.

961
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:29,590
Mr. Mills mask like a car.
He got one,

962
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:30,870
he got one.
I should get a case.

963
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:33,260
Remember it tells all joke that's women
love mystery,

964
00:41:33,261 --> 00:41:34,040
which is why whenever

965
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,350
my girlfriend leaves the room I'd take a
shit and one of her shoes,

966
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:41,430
um,
tell literally has a great one liner for

967
00:41:41,431 --> 00:41:44,280
every occasion.
So funny.

968
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:45,510
Uh,
but uh,

969
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,240
the,
uh,

970
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:53,140
so it's built in to want mystery so you
can't,

971
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:55,460
we literally can't talk about it
beforehand.

972
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:57,920
You ever tried to talk,
you ever go,

973
00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:59,450
you can't say,
hey,

974
00:41:59,451 --> 00:42:01,610
I'd like to go have sex.
Now you have to go like let's go look at

975
00:42:01,611 --> 00:42:03,260
my stamps or whatever that,
you know what I mean?

976
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:07,640
Whatever euphemistic thing you,
hey come up and look at my mattress,

977
00:42:07,641 --> 00:42:09,320
my uh,
I got an egg carton,

978
00:42:09,321 --> 00:42:11,300
whatever your fucking,
whatever your,

979
00:42:11,301 --> 00:42:15,110
your ruse to get her up there because
you can't say you want to have sex.

980
00:42:15,111 --> 00:42:17,750
Cause it's like about shame.
Part of it's a lot of,

981
00:42:17,751 --> 00:42:20,270
it's the mystery thing,
but then there's also like women can't

982
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:21,350
openly go like,
yes,

983
00:42:21,351 --> 00:42:21,980
I would like that.

984
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:24,650
Also after you date them for a while,
you can.

985
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:25,850
Yes.
Agreed.

986
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:29,120
Once you've done it a couple of times.
Yeah.

987
00:42:29,121 --> 00:42:32,030
I think it's the longer I do this.
Yes.

988
00:42:32,031 --> 00:42:34,910
I think it takes longer than,
than a few times.

989
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:37,070
Really good to get there.
Maybe that's you bro.

990
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:42,120
Maybe that's maybe that's on me Bro.
I'm always been weak bro.

991
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:44,810
You know man,
I ain't nothing but a bitch bro.

992
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:47,510
I wonder man,
I wonder how we're going to get past

993
00:42:47,511 --> 00:42:51,860
this culturally I don't and that's so,
so what I've been talking to people

994
00:42:51,861 --> 00:42:56,600
about is like,
so there needs to be rules of engagement

995
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:57,770
and like,
Whoa,

996
00:42:57,830 --> 00:43:00,350
I think guys will be fine with
scheduling it.

997
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,050
The thing about the consent,
because there was a thing in that

998
00:43:03,051 --> 00:43:05,600
article about ever,
that thing that they used to have like

999
00:43:05,601 --> 00:43:07,820
at Antioch College like 20 years ago
where it was like,

1000
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:09,350
I want to touch your breasts now.

1001
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:12,680
I would like to.
I know,

1002
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,770
I know,
but I believe,

1003
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:19,610
uh,
guys would be fine with that.

1004
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:21,440
I really do.
Cause I don't,

1005
00:43:21,441 --> 00:43:22,430
I think guys are like,
wait,

1006
00:43:22,431 --> 00:43:25,850
I'm going to get to touch a boob at 1206
great.

1007
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:26,880
Yeah.
Put it on.

1008
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:28,910
Like,
can I touch your breasts now?

1009
00:43:28,911 --> 00:43:31,100
Yes.
Can I take your pants off?

1010
00:43:31,101 --> 00:43:32,270
Not yet.
Okay.

1011
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:34,730
And then you go back to making out.
Can I take your pants off now?

1012
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,710
Okay.
Like you've seen that video.

1013
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:37,340
Yeah.
Yeah.

1014
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:40,840
It's preposterous.
What other answers die?

1015
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:45,540
This port that see the guy in the video,
they may get like the lowest test guy of

1016
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:49,520
[inaudible] who just like this weird
Beta male.

1017
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:52,040
The whole,
the whole thing is just so strange.

1018
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:55,400
I know,
but just if you look at this,

1019
00:43:55,490 --> 00:43:58,790
you know scientifically,
what's the answer?

1020
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:00,140
You got to get to know people better for
you.

1021
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:01,940
Fuck them.
That's a big one.

1022
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:06,080
Like did the courtship like period
should be longer?

1023
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:08,090
I agree.
I mean I look get Hawaiian and

1024
00:44:08,091 --> 00:44:11,570
implemented that in my own life where
I'm like I don't cause I don't want,

1025
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:16,600
cause I know once I sleep with somebody
I'll feel guilty and if I don't want to

1026
00:44:17,451 --> 00:44:20,840
see them again and they'll be mad.
Yeah.

1027
00:44:20,841 --> 00:44:25,010
That's how I just try to park.
I just try to put it off for as long as

1028
00:44:25,011 --> 00:44:28,140
I possibly can and then decide do I even
want,

1029
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:32,820
because a lot of times I've had like
friends and I haven't talked about where

1030
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:37,470
you sleep with somebody cause you can't
think of an excuse not to,

1031
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:39,630
you know what I'm saying?
Where you're like,

1032
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:41,900
ah,
I did die.

1033
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:45,210
Yeah,
I got to a place and then you don't

1034
00:44:45,211 --> 00:44:46,080
even,
you know,

1035
00:44:46,081 --> 00:44:47,220
you don't want to see him again.

1036
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,960
Oh that's the worst.
You know,

1037
00:44:48,961 --> 00:44:51,360
you don't want to see them again,
but they're like going for it.

1038
00:44:51,361 --> 00:44:52,470
You're like,
okay.

1039
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:55,350
I guess the problem is once you're
engaged,

1040
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:00,030
once you're locked and loaded and yet
probably take this to the end.

1041
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:01,710
Yeah,
I'd be a fool.

1042
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,860
I'd be a fool.
Not disrespectful.

1043
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:05,640
Stair gift.
Horse in the mouth.

1044
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:08,110
What the fuck does that even mean a gift
towards you?

1045
00:45:08,111 --> 00:45:10,620
Like looking at a horse's teeth?
Is that the idea behind that?

1046
00:45:10,621 --> 00:45:12,840
Like to make sure it's not too old.
Yeah,

1047
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:16,110
but weird expression.
Stary gift horse in the mouth.

1048
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:17,820
Yes.
How was that one still around?

1049
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:19,110
Ah,
fuck.

1050
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:20,710
It's looking at horses.
Yeah,

1051
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:21,330
there are there.
Well,

1052
00:45:21,330 --> 00:45:23,460
there's a lot of things from Horst
Times.

1053
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,350
Yeah,
that's a big one.

1054
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:26,640
Uh,
yeah,

1055
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:29,520
but so there is a thing of like just
wait,

1056
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:31,320
but again,
that,

1057
00:45:31,350 --> 00:45:33,240
that's where male nature comes in,
right?

1058
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:36,870
Male nature doesn't lightweighting.
Middle Nature does not like waiting male

1059
00:45:36,871 --> 00:45:41,871
nature's not like patient male nature
also is a testosterone itself.

1060
00:45:44,490 --> 00:45:46,710
B gets risky behavior.
Oh yeah.

1061
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:50,790
And a lot of it,
some of it ends up in crime.

1062
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:55,170
Some it ends up in fucking in,
you know,

1063
00:45:55,171 --> 00:45:59,310
electricity or the Wright brothers.
You know what I mean?

1064
00:45:59,430 --> 00:46:02,490
Yeah.
And it's like just harnessing it for the

1065
00:46:02,491 --> 00:46:05,700
right thing,
you know,

1066
00:46:05,701 --> 00:46:09,630
it's like the cause that like the,
the male character is,

1067
00:46:09,631 --> 00:46:12,180
it is,
a lot of it is some of the shit is

1068
00:46:12,181 --> 00:46:13,014
toxic.
Well,

1069
00:46:13,130 --> 00:46:17,750
testosterone,
it a lot of ways is power and with power

1070
00:46:17,751 --> 00:46:19,700
comes responsibility.
I mean,

1071
00:46:19,701 --> 00:46:21,980
but I say that,
I don't mean it's power like that

1072
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:25,850
estrogen is in power.
I mean there's a fuel to testosterone,

1073
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:27,890
the,
that when you have testosterone,

1074
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:32,540
what it's doing is it's providing you a
certain amount of ambition,

1075
00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:35,990
a certain amount of desire,
certain amount of lust.

1076
00:46:35,991 --> 00:46:37,610
And that sort of,
that though,

1077
00:46:37,611 --> 00:46:41,540
that's the mechanism that a lot of menus
to get things going in their life.

1078
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:42,950
And some guys don't,
you know,

1079
00:46:42,951 --> 00:46:47,150
I know a lot of men who are like
aggressive testosterone males who are

1080
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:51,050
just chasing pussy and not doing
anything with their lives and they've,

1081
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:54,470
they've become addicted to that and it's
become a major distraction.

1082
00:46:54,471 --> 00:46:56,780
And usually their career suffers.
Yeah.

1083
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:58,460
Yeah.
Usually those guys,

1084
00:46:58,461 --> 00:47:00,080
they're their careers in the shitter.

1085
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:03,200
I think we may be thinking of the same
earth and problem.

1086
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:06,710
Um,
we know a lot of guys like that.

1087
00:47:06,711 --> 00:47:07,620
Yeah.
You know,

1088
00:47:07,690 --> 00:47:10,530
um,
I was talking to my friend Michelle Wolf

1089
00:47:10,531 --> 00:47:13,410
who just got an HBO special.
That's really good.

1090
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:16,960
And uh,
but the nice ladies I where things heard

1091
00:47:16,961 --> 00:47:17,794
that's really good.
Yeah.

1092
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:19,250
Um,
uh,

1093
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:20,100
and,
uh,

1094
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:23,040
she was I with,
we talk about this shit constantly.

1095
00:47:23,041 --> 00:47:26,340
I was like,W men want power,
right?

1096
00:47:26,850 --> 00:47:28,260
Man.
Want to dominate.

1097
00:47:28,290 --> 00:47:30,250
Like that's our thing.
Like I'm going to expand the,

1098
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:32,590
I gotta you know,
it's like that's capitalism.

1099
00:47:32,591 --> 00:47:34,160
That's uh,
uh,

1100
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,070
that's,
uh,

1101
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:37,640
empire.
That's everything.

1102
00:47:37,641 --> 00:47:38,680
It's just expand,
expand,

1103
00:47:38,681 --> 00:47:39,401
expand power,
power,

1104
00:47:39,401 --> 00:47:40,060
power,
power.

1105
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:42,790
And it's like men want,
it's the scarface thing.

1106
00:47:42,791 --> 00:47:44,830
First you get the money,
then you get power,

1107
00:47:44,831 --> 00:47:46,810
then you get the women.
And I was like,

1108
00:47:46,811 --> 00:47:48,850
what dude?
Do Women want power?

1109
00:47:48,851 --> 00:47:49,870
And she's like,
no,

1110
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:53,050
they don't really.
Women want control,

1111
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:56,680
if that makes sense.
Like they don't want empire.

1112
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:58,630
They want you

1113
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:03,190
too.
They want to be able to depend on you.

1114
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:04,900
Right.
For,

1115
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,960
I think fear is fine depending on you,
isn't it?

1116
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,630
Again,
as we're going back to those natural

1117
00:48:10,631 --> 00:48:15,190
instincts that a mother needs the father
to be the one who's going to watch over

1118
00:48:15,191 --> 00:48:16,970
her and provide,
yeah,

1119
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:19,150
that's it.
And that sounds sexist,

1120
00:48:19,151 --> 00:48:20,100
right?
People don't like that.

1121
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:21,580
Well,
the woman doesn't need demand to provide

1122
00:48:21,581 --> 00:48:22,720
anymore.
I understand that.

1123
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:23,830
You're right.
You don't,

1124
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:26,260
for the most part,
I'm not saying that women aren't equal

1125
00:48:26,261 --> 00:48:27,970
to men in terms of their ability to do
things.

1126
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:31,210
But what I am saying is there are
certain inherent instincts that we have

1127
00:48:31,211 --> 00:48:32,930
that are leftover,
you know?

1128
00:48:32,931 --> 00:48:35,830
And there's also like a lot of weird
shit,

1129
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:39,250
right?
Like with this domination and submission

1130
00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:41,290
submissive thing that men and women
have.

1131
00:48:41,291 --> 00:48:44,920
There's also rape fantasies.
There's also weird snm shit.

1132
00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:46,870
There's a lot of weird stuff that people
have.

1133
00:48:46,930 --> 00:48:48,960
Yes.
That's just built into the,

1134
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:51,190
into the,
into the operating system and your

1135
00:48:51,191 --> 00:48:53,770
operating system is probably going to be
different than Jamie's and different

1136
00:48:53,771 --> 00:48:56,050
than mine and yet there's massive
variables.

1137
00:48:56,051 --> 00:48:58,050
And to try to find them,
you're like,

1138
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:00,310
I need,
I used to date a girl and she used to

1139
00:49:00,311 --> 00:49:03,340
want me to just choke her all the time.
She would grab my hand.

1140
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:08,070
I wasn't on her more girls because of
your size would want that.

1141
00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:10,350
I whenever I see a guy,
a girl,

1142
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:13,920
like you never see it like a tiny girl
with like just a monster of a dude.

1143
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:16,110
Yeah.
And I always want to say to the women

1144
00:49:16,111 --> 00:49:16,411
like,
Oh,

1145
00:49:16,411 --> 00:49:21,411
you like getting fucking rail.
You don't like you fuck it.

1146
00:49:22,290 --> 00:49:25,170
Like to get,
do you like to almost get murdered every

1147
00:49:25,171 --> 00:49:25,830
time?
Huh?

1148
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:28,020
That's your thick.
Some girls like that.

1149
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:29,380
I would to,
yeah,

1150
00:49:29,470 --> 00:49:31,290
like there's a ton of girls that like
that.

1151
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,810
And again,
and I think we've talked about this

1152
00:49:33,811 --> 00:49:37,680
before,
it's because girls never really saw porn

1153
00:49:37,681 --> 00:49:42,681
before 1998 99 so now there's the one,
the full like all the options and

1154
00:49:45,101 --> 00:49:45,601
they're going,
oh,

1155
00:49:45,601 --> 00:49:46,210
that,
yeah,

1156
00:49:46,210 --> 00:49:47,160
Chilean fun.
Oh,

1157
00:49:47,161 --> 00:49:49,540
that's what I want.
I want someone to spit in my mouth.

1158
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:51,360
Yeah.
Am I fucking hair?

1159
00:49:51,361 --> 00:49:52,450
Wow.
Yeah.

1160
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:55,140
Cause otherwise they learn about that
stuff while they're doing it.

1161
00:49:55,141 --> 00:49:56,460
Like a guy spanks him.
And I'm like,

1162
00:49:56,490 --> 00:49:58,760
yes,
but no.

1163
00:49:58,770 --> 00:49:59,410
And wait,
I mean,

1164
00:49:59,410 --> 00:50:00,960
wait,
remember when you spank me?

1165
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:03,000
Well,
I want you to spank me because I want

1166
00:50:03,001 --> 00:50:04,980
you to spank me.
I don't want you to spank me because you

1167
00:50:04,981 --> 00:50:06,740
want to speak.
This isn't,

1168
00:50:06,810 --> 00:50:07,621
and it's like,
okay,

1169
00:50:07,621 --> 00:50:08,790
wait,
what

1170
00:50:11,330 --> 00:50:14,970
I did girl once who told me she wanted
me to rape her and I said,

1171
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,220
okay,
but if you want me to rape you,

1172
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,710
then it's not raping you.
And she goes,

1173
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:22,710
and she was like,
she was joking around,

1174
00:50:22,711 --> 00:50:25,590
she was like halfway joking around,
but she had some weird shit.

1175
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:28,250
Like she wanted me to grab the back of
her head

1176
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:32,030
and force it on my Dick.
Like she liked that she got off on that

1177
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:33,291
and I go,
yeah,

1178
00:50:33,291 --> 00:50:38,120
but the only way that I can do that is
if I know that you want me to do that.

1179
00:50:38,570 --> 00:50:41,610
Like I can't,
like I can't deal with,

1180
00:50:41,690 --> 00:50:43,820
but it's not,
I'm not like,

1181
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,700
that's whenever girls want rough shit.
I'm like,

1182
00:50:46,730 --> 00:50:48,130
yeah,
I can.

1183
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:49,550
I like,
I can get there,

1184
00:50:49,810 --> 00:50:53,660
but here's the thing,
like saying you want someone to rape.

1185
00:50:53,690 --> 00:50:57,140
The problem with the rape thing is like
if we just go through this,

1186
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,390
are you going to fight back?
Are you going to say no,

1187
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:01,220
if I keep going,
that's still rape.

1188
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:03,020
Yeah.
Like even though you said you wanted me

1189
00:51:03,021 --> 00:51:05,240
to rape dude,
if you say no and keep going and

1190
00:51:05,570 --> 00:51:09,560
ultimately it just wound up staying the
way it was like we never went into fully

1191
00:51:09,561 --> 00:51:11,060
into the rave fantasy because I was
like,

1192
00:51:11,330 --> 00:51:12,740
oh,
super perturbed by it.

1193
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:14,600
I was like,
this could go terrible.

1194
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,840
Like you can't just,
yeah.

1195
00:51:16,850 --> 00:51:20,210
Also,
I don't want ever to get sexually

1196
00:51:20,270 --> 00:51:23,150
aroused by that.
I don't want to be connected.

1197
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:25,940
Yeah.
Because I think that like I stayed at

1198
00:51:25,941 --> 00:51:28,880
girl and she used to like the rubber
feet on my deck and for a while I had

1199
00:51:28,881 --> 00:51:31,070
like this foot fetish thing going on.
You know what I mean?

1200
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:32,350
Yeah.
And uh,

1201
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:33,820
like I had it for years,
but it's,

1202
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:35,090
she started it.
Yeah.

1203
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:36,540
Well she was into it.
Yeah.

1204
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:38,870
She'd like suck on my toes and shit.
She was a freak,

1205
00:51:39,290 --> 00:51:43,880
but she,
but that thing became like a sexually

1206
00:51:43,881 --> 00:51:46,220
arousing thing to me.
I look at girls' feet and I would get

1207
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:48,640
excited about them for years.
Yeah.

1208
00:51:49,250 --> 00:51:53,420
If you had a girl who wanted you to
smack her around.

1209
00:51:53,530 --> 00:51:54,130
Yeah.
You know,

1210
00:51:54,130 --> 00:51:58,040
and I have a friend who likes that,
like he's into that and dates girls that

1211
00:51:58,041 --> 00:51:59,570
are into that and he's like,
you know,

1212
00:51:59,571 --> 00:52:01,970
like probably on their pictures,
their own website,

1213
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:05,420
their own sam pictures of like bruises
that he left on them.

1214
00:52:05,421 --> 00:52:07,190
I'm like,
Jesus Christ dude.

1215
00:52:07,550 --> 00:52:08,061
And he's like,
yeah,

1216
00:52:08,061 --> 00:52:09,920
if it goes all ugly,
it's going to go real ugly for me.

1217
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:12,380
Yeah.
Because it's consensual.

1218
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:15,510
But what proof does he have that no,
I,

1219
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:16,341
yes.
Yeah.

1220
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:18,590
I don't want to get sexually attracted
to that and I don't want to,

1221
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:22,790
I don't want that to be like the foot
fetish thing where you become that like

1222
00:52:22,791 --> 00:52:25,220
that's your thing.
Like I'm really into a smack and girls

1223
00:52:25,221 --> 00:52:26,630
around and holding him down.
Yeah,

1224
00:52:26,790 --> 00:52:28,840
yeah.
Cause then you got to like,

1225
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:31,810
that's what you need.
Then you'd have to go to craigslist or

1226
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:33,700
you'd have to like,
you got an a toll on.

1227
00:52:33,730 --> 00:52:34,720
Yeah.
You mean you have to,

1228
00:52:34,721 --> 00:52:37,030
you have to like say look,
this is what I'm looking for.

1229
00:52:37,031 --> 00:52:39,190
Very specifically.
Is this cool with you?

1230
00:52:39,191 --> 00:52:43,260
I come to you with a heavy heart
dear Craig.

1231
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:47,560
But then the problem with that is like,
you know,

1232
00:52:48,490 --> 00:52:52,690
how do you know that the woman wants
that every time you know there's going

1233
00:52:52,691 --> 00:52:55,270
to be tying now that's what I'm saying
about like,

1234
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:56,590
Hey,
if I'm guessed wrong,

1235
00:52:56,620 --> 00:52:58,420
I'm going to deal with which is where
you need,

1236
00:52:58,450 --> 00:53:03,450
that's where consent comes in.
That's where like consent and I again,

1237
00:53:03,971 --> 00:53:06,910
because women are physically weaker in
general in men and,

1238
00:53:06,970 --> 00:53:10,630
and when sex,
it has to be them pitching it.

1239
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:11,890
Yes.
In a way.

1240
00:53:11,910 --> 00:53:13,300
Like,
because otherwise,

1241
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:15,570
especially if it's physical.
Yeah.

1242
00:53:16,290 --> 00:53:20,020
A buddy of mine who's huge,
physically huge,

1243
00:53:20,410 --> 00:53:23,950
a girl said choke me.
And he was like,

1244
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:27,120
I'll,
so we just went like,

1245
00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:32,340
what does it want to nail the boat show
he won?

1246
00:53:32,370 --> 00:53:36,330
She wanted like a fucking real,
like real and he's like,

1247
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:39,990
I'll kill you.
And so he literally was so scared that

1248
00:53:39,991 --> 00:53:43,950
he just kinda like put his forearm,
um,

1249
00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:45,750
call the ex boyfriend as soon as he was
done.

1250
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:49,030
It's also crazy how fine get your choke
game.

1251
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:54,030
Yeah.
It's also crazy how the law without me

1252
00:53:54,031 --> 00:53:56,550
yet like the how hard they want you to
choke him.

1253
00:53:56,690 --> 00:53:58,020
Yeah.
Like where it's like,

1254
00:53:58,050 --> 00:53:59,430
oh,
you really want,

1255
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:01,490
I don't know.
I don't want to,

1256
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:04,770
it's literally just feels like,
hang me off the roof.

1257
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:07,320
Hey,
hang on,

1258
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:10,500
hang me off the roof and then wonder
what that is too.

1259
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:12,690
Like why does that feel good?
Uh,

1260
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:14,870
well,
it's based devolution.

1261
00:54:14,990 --> 00:54:17,850
Yeah.
It consensual sex just started about

1262
00:54:17,851 --> 00:54:19,620
3000 years ago,
if that,

1263
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:21,360
yeah.
I'm being generous.

1264
00:54:21,390 --> 00:54:22,980
Yeah.
3000 years ago it was probably an

1265
00:54:22,981 --> 00:54:24,010
option.
Yeah,

1266
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,070
yeah,
yeah.

1267
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:29,140
Just out of respect your brothers.
Yeah,

1268
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:32,700
I mean shit like it's,
it's just,

1269
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:35,430
it's a part of like animals.
Yeah.

1270
00:54:35,431 --> 00:54:40,020
It consensual sex is like that thing of
like the universe is this old and earth

1271
00:54:40,021 --> 00:54:41,700
is life on earth.
Is that old?

1272
00:54:42,270 --> 00:54:45,960
Yeah.
It's a nonconsensual sex is this long

1273
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:49,140
and consensual sex is it fucking tiny
sliver.

1274
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:50,040
I think

1275
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:55,040
the good about all of this stuff,
all this me too stuff and is that it's

1276
00:54:55,471 --> 00:54:59,460
going to force human beings to
reevaluate their behavior and that is

1277
00:54:59,461 --> 00:54:59,730
what

1278
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:01,190
moves evolution.
Cultural.

1279
00:55:01,191 --> 00:55:03,480
Correct.
The ultra evolution is moving.

1280
00:55:03,810 --> 00:55:06,690
Yeah.
And also I'm fucking as a guy who roots

1281
00:55:06,691 --> 00:55:11,691
for the underdog fucking and justice
fucking fucking so happy for women.

1282
00:55:12,090 --> 00:55:13,470
Yeah.
So happy for women.

1283
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:14,050
I think

1284
00:55:14,050 --> 00:55:19,050
we need in,
I think we need laws like unbelievably

1285
00:55:19,121 --> 00:55:23,980
brutal laws when it comes to pills that
people dropping drinks when it comes to

1286
00:55:23,981 --> 00:55:26,110
like the cosby thing.
I heard another story the other night

1287
00:55:26,111 --> 00:55:29,350
about that and I,
I just,

1288
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:32,800
that freaks me out.
That's the one that freaks me out I

1289
00:55:32,801 --> 00:55:36,280
think the most because I feel like
that's like straight sociopath shit.

1290
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:37,271
Yeah.
You,

1291
00:55:37,271 --> 00:55:41,760
you want this from some person and you
just feel free to grab something their

1292
00:55:41,761 --> 00:55:44,920
drink and sit back and wait and watch
and watch and kick in.

1293
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:48,010
I had a girl accused me of doing that to
her whoa.

1294
00:55:48,190 --> 00:55:51,820
Terrifying in Vegas,
um,

1295
00:55:54,070 --> 00:55:56,680
Haida Chappelle show,

1296
00:55:56,710 --> 00:56:00,850
almost to the week and uh,
maybe a month after the fear factor

1297
00:56:00,851 --> 00:56:01,391
sketched.
Jeff,

1298
00:56:01,391 --> 00:56:03,280
thanks again.
And uh,

1299
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:06,970
and uh,
so meet a girl in Vegas.

1300
00:56:07,010 --> 00:56:09,520
She launched her sharp,
we mutual friends.

1301
00:56:09,521 --> 00:56:14,521
We meet for a drink at a bar at the hard
rock cafe or hard rock hotel.

1302
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:18,070
And uh,
I get there,

1303
00:56:18,071 --> 00:56:23,071
she's drinking a mixed drink and um,
and uh,

1304
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:24,250
a buddy of mine,

1305
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:25,300
our mutual friend is like,
Hey,

1306
00:56:25,301 --> 00:56:26,920
I'm having a party in my room.
You guys want to come?

1307
00:56:27,370 --> 00:56:29,140
And um,
and we're like,

1308
00:56:29,141 --> 00:56:29,471
yeah,
cool.

1309
00:56:29,471 --> 00:56:30,700
We'll come up,
we have a beer,

1310
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:33,250
me and her.
And then we'd go up to my buddy's room,

1311
00:56:33,650 --> 00:56:35,410
uh,
on our way to my buddy's room.

1312
00:56:35,530 --> 00:56:37,120
Uh,
she is like,

1313
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:38,760
I don't,
we're walking across the casino.

1314
00:56:38,761 --> 00:56:40,120
She was like,
I don't feel good.

1315
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:43,210
Like,
I don't feel like 100%.

1316
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:45,460
And uh,
and I was like,

1317
00:56:45,461 --> 00:56:46,300
why don't,
okay.

1318
00:56:46,301 --> 00:56:47,410
I was like,
sit down,

1319
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:51,070
like sit down at like a slot machine and
a,

1320
00:56:51,071 --> 00:56:53,260
and I was like,
I'll go get us drinks.

1321
00:56:53,261 --> 00:56:55,090
And she's like,
will you get me a beer?

1322
00:56:55,091 --> 00:56:55,751
I was like,
no,

1323
00:56:55,751 --> 00:56:57,850
I'll get you a water.
Like I'm not fucking,

1324
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:00,670
so I come back with two waters and she's
like,

1325
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:02,680
yeah,
I just feel like way more fucked up than

1326
00:57:02,681 --> 00:57:03,550
I should be.
Like,

1327
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:07,390
I feel like I feel like somebody puts
something in my drink.

1328
00:57:07,870 --> 00:57:12,100
And I was like,
not thinking the double entendre of

1329
00:57:12,101 --> 00:57:12,934
this.
I go,

1330
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:16,930
do you want to go back to your room?
And she looks at me and goes,

1331
00:57:16,990 --> 00:57:20,470
I think you put something in my drink
and runs.

1332
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:23,830
And I chased her for like 10 feet.
And I was like,

1333
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:28,030
I can't chase a girl.
Like I can't,

1334
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:30,520
I can't chase this girl.
So

1335
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:32,230
whoa.
How well did you know her?

1336
00:57:32,770 --> 00:57:36,340
Not well at all.
I met her on a Tuesday and this was a

1337
00:57:36,341 --> 00:57:37,174
Friday.

1338
00:57:38,430 --> 00:57:41,790
Um,
so for three hours I was like,

1339
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:44,400
what am I?
Maybe I'm going to jail.

1340
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:46,020
Like I,
I didn't know,

1341
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:48,720
like I didn't do anything,
but I couldn't prove I didn't do

1342
00:57:48,721 --> 00:57:50,730
anything.
Like I couldn't almost,

1343
00:57:50,790 --> 00:57:54,360
it would be a move at that point to call
the police.

1344
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:55,620
Okay.

1345
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:58,410
And say someone just accused me and
putting something in their drink.

1346
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:00,580
I absolutely didn't.
Um,

1347
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:03,510
could you please do a tox colleagues?
She exam on her?

1348
00:58:03,511 --> 00:58:05,420
She might just be drunk and crazy.
Yeah.

1349
00:58:06,630 --> 00:58:08,310
Looking back,
thinking back now,

1350
00:58:08,311 --> 00:58:10,710
I realize it was at a casino.
So there's cameras everywhere.

1351
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:11,690
Right?
Um,

1352
00:58:11,850 --> 00:58:15,930
but could the cameras,
the cameras have picked up me fucking

1353
00:58:15,931 --> 00:58:17,580
dropping.
Like could they,

1354
00:58:17,581 --> 00:58:19,680
maybe they weren't high resolution
enough.

1355
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:20,963
What year?

1356
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:23,770
2004 they probably were.

1357
00:58:25,170 --> 00:58:25,891
Well,
they're there.

1358
00:58:25,891 --> 00:58:28,280
They're there to like prevent stealing,
right?

1359
00:58:28,281 --> 00:58:30,240
Yeah.
And then gambling tricks.

1360
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:32,470
So they must be able to see like your
hands,

1361
00:58:32,490 --> 00:58:34,100
they can zoom in,
I think,

1362
00:58:34,170 --> 00:58:36,390
but how you know,
how much whenever you see it.

1363
00:58:36,391 --> 00:58:36,470
Yeah.

1364
00:58:36,470 --> 00:58:40,940
It's all kind of like kind of pixelated.
But after three hours,

1365
00:58:40,941 --> 00:58:42,800
she finally like,
called me and was like,

1366
00:58:43,490 --> 00:58:45,860
Hey,
I know

1367
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:47,350
because I called her.
I was like,

1368
00:58:47,351 --> 00:58:48,184
Hey,
[inaudible],

1369
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:52,060
I didn't poison you.
And I don't think anyone would believe I

1370
00:58:52,061 --> 00:58:54,700
put like,
I have no reason to write poisoned.

1371
00:58:55,180 --> 00:58:57,250
You wouldn't do it anyway.
It's like,

1372
00:58:57,251 --> 00:59:00,130
it's not you like you go to court
because you wouldn't do it,

1373
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:02,050
of course.
But I would have said the same thing

1374
00:59:02,051 --> 00:59:03,730
about bill cosby,
which you have.

1375
00:59:04,570 --> 00:59:05,950
Oh,
did I ever tell you this story about

1376
00:59:05,951 --> 00:59:10,170
bill cosby?
So I dated

1377
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:11,820
or all?
Uh,

1378
00:59:11,850 --> 00:59:13,350
in like,
oh five,

1379
00:59:13,351 --> 00:59:14,340
oh six,
oh seven,

1380
00:59:14,490 --> 00:59:15,960
uh,
in New York,

1381
00:59:16,590 --> 00:59:19,200
beautiful girl,
mixed mixed race.

1382
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:21,950
Um,
and cool,

1383
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:23,150
whatever.
Great.

1384
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:24,440
And,
um,

1385
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:28,370
she used to talk about,
she some bill cosby came up one time.

1386
00:59:28,371 --> 00:59:29,001
She was like,
Oh,

1387
00:59:29,001 --> 00:59:30,380
Mr Cosmi,
what a sweet man.

1388
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:31,440
And I was like,
Ma,

1389
00:59:33,490 --> 00:59:34,760
ma.
She's like,

1390
00:59:34,790 --> 00:59:39,560
Oh yeah,
one time I was on the street crying and,

1391
00:59:39,561 --> 00:59:43,160
uh,
Mr Cosby walked up and introduced

1392
00:59:43,161 --> 00:59:44,630
himself and I was like,
why are you crying?

1393
00:59:44,631 --> 00:59:45,890
And,
and,

1394
00:59:45,891 --> 00:59:47,180
uh,
and,

1395
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:48,470
and,
you know,

1396
00:59:48,590 --> 00:59:52,220
and we struck up a friendship and I was
like,

1397
00:59:52,940 --> 00:59:54,500
he was trying to fucking,
just so,

1398
00:59:54,501 --> 00:59:55,580
you know,
I'm just like,

1399
00:59:55,581 --> 00:59:57,260
just seeing how he's trying to fuck you.
She's like,

1400
00:59:57,261 --> 00:59:58,760
no,
he's not trying to fuck me.

1401
00:59:58,761 --> 01:00:00,260
Like,
and uh,

1402
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:01,370
and,
and like,

1403
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:02,440
what are you talking about?
Like,

1404
01:00:02,450 --> 01:00:03,283
no,
it was trying to fucking,

1405
01:00:03,950 --> 01:00:06,530
again,
like I'm an animal for suggesting it,

1406
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:10,580
like who you are,
so boarish why would you possibly think?

1407
01:00:11,060 --> 01:00:15,710
And it's like,
cause I fucking met the guy and he's not

1408
01:00:15,711 --> 01:00:16,820
a good dude.

1409
01:00:17,390 --> 01:00:19,280
Um,
and uh,

1410
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:22,880
and so she,
she defended him.

1411
01:00:23,010 --> 01:00:25,940
He used to take me to place just all the
shit.

1412
01:00:25,941 --> 01:00:26,960
I'm like,
okay.

1413
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:28,540
He just had a long game.
Yeah,

1414
01:00:28,550 --> 01:00:30,100
man.
And uh,

1415
01:00:30,170 --> 01:00:31,970
so then all this causes me,
shit comes up.

1416
01:00:32,630 --> 01:00:33,490
Then I texted,
I go,

1417
01:00:33,491 --> 01:00:35,300
so what do you think?
What do you think you're a boy?

1418
01:00:35,930 --> 01:00:37,160
And she goes,
uh,

1419
01:00:37,910 --> 01:00:41,750
she said something like,
I think like he absolutely did it.

1420
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:46,460
And I think his wife was in on it,
which again,

1421
01:00:46,461 --> 01:00:47,960
I don't know what the,
what you meant by that.

1422
01:00:47,961 --> 01:00:50,690
But,
so then I were texting back and forth.

1423
01:00:50,691 --> 01:00:51,950
She goes,
you know,

1424
01:00:51,951 --> 01:00:56,951
one time I was supposed to meet him in
Philadelphia and he told me what to wear

1425
01:00:57,381 --> 01:00:59,840
and how to wear my hair.
Oh,

1426
01:00:59,890 --> 01:01:01,330
Jesus.
And she goes,

1427
01:01:01,350 --> 01:01:05,330
and thankfully I got sick.
She was going to do it.

1428
01:01:05,450 --> 01:01:07,150
She was going to,
yeah.

1429
01:01:07,730 --> 01:01:08,810
Wow.
That was the time.

1430
01:01:08,890 --> 01:01:09,910
Yeah.
And uh,

1431
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:11,300
yeah.
And He,

1432
01:01:11,301 --> 01:01:13,910
uh,
he was gonna take her to the ultimate

1433
01:01:13,911 --> 01:01:15,560
musical.
Uh,

1434
01:01:15,561 --> 01:01:18,290
and she,
and thankfully she got sick and didn't

1435
01:01:18,291 --> 01:01:19,670
go.
And I was like,

1436
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:22,100
in the whole time it's like,
yeah,

1437
01:01:22,130 --> 01:01:25,130
that's the thing that one of the things
with some of these stories is like,

1438
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:30,580
why would bill cosby want to be friends
with some lady?

1439
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:32,930
Do you know what I mean?
Like what,

1440
01:01:32,931 --> 01:01:35,390
just because you're great looking.
Yeah.

1441
01:01:35,420 --> 01:01:38,480
Well,
I think it's entirely possible that a

1442
01:01:38,481 --> 01:01:40,790
guy could be friends with a beautiful,
again,

1443
01:01:40,791 --> 01:01:42,820
I don't,
even though he wants to fuck her,

1444
01:01:42,850 --> 01:01:45,170
just keep it together and just be
friends with her and,

1445
01:01:45,171 --> 01:01:48,590
you know,
find some interesting muse.

1446
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:53,630
I don't think it's impossible,
but I do think it's not very likely in

1447
01:01:53,631 --> 01:01:55,370
my experience with humanity.
Right.

1448
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:56,090
No,
it's true.

1449
01:01:56,090 --> 01:01:57,920
And also why would it got torched
himself like that?

1450
01:01:58,190 --> 01:02:01,130
It's like when a guy has a hot nanny,
dummy,

1451
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:04,160
ugly nanny.
Yeah.

1452
01:02:04,340 --> 01:02:06,710
Fucking don't.
Why do that to yourself?

1453
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:08,530
The hot nanny always winds up being a
pro.

1454
01:02:08,550 --> 01:02:10,580
Oh,
fucking every time.

1455
01:02:10,581 --> 01:02:11,510
No,
she's hot too.

1456
01:02:12,410 --> 01:02:14,650
Does she know Jackie?
No,

1457
01:02:14,730 --> 01:02:16,600
she's just sweats.
I'm sure they were.

1458
01:02:16,601 --> 01:02:18,440
Spends all day.
Let me pick that up for you.

1459
01:02:19,530 --> 01:02:19,980
You're such

1460
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:20,960
a good dad.
Yeah.

1461
01:02:22,070 --> 01:02:24,090
Yeah.
Like just don't hire a hot nanny.

1462
01:02:24,210 --> 01:02:25,050
Yeah,
I would,

1463
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:27,990
I would give that advice as well.
I wouldn't hire a hot assistant.

1464
01:02:28,350 --> 01:02:30,090
That's good devices as well.
The Fa,

1465
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:31,170
I don't know if I ever told you this
story.

1466
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:32,280
So,
uh,

1467
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:36,690
so my,
I hired an assistant for the sexy for

1468
01:02:36,691 --> 01:02:38,190
the second season Chappelle show.
Right.

1469
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:40,770
And um,
and uh,

1470
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:45,920
interviewed a bunch of people and uh,
this girl came in super,

1471
01:02:46,171 --> 01:02:48,300
just like sharp,
just like I could just tell she was

1472
01:02:48,301 --> 01:02:49,540
sharp.
Uh,

1473
01:02:50,070 --> 01:02:53,160
and,
but she also happened to be good looking

1474
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:57,180
and uh,
so I hire and Chappelle,

1475
01:02:57,181 --> 01:03:01,470
Caesar and goes word.
She was the most qualified and I was

1476
01:03:01,471 --> 01:03:02,490
like,
yeah,

1477
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:07,440
she was the most qualified now.
I was like,

1478
01:03:07,441 --> 01:03:09,090
yeah,
she was the most qualified,

1479
01:03:09,210 --> 01:03:10,910
believe me now.
Uh,

1480
01:03:11,250 --> 01:03:15,840
and I was proven right because she has
since gone on to produce ghostbusters

1481
01:03:16,290 --> 01:03:17,400
and the heat.

1482
01:03:17,910 --> 01:03:21,150
And all of these movies and she just
happens to be good luck.

1483
01:03:21,230 --> 01:03:22,170
But it was one of the things,
I was like,

1484
01:03:22,171 --> 01:03:26,460
I fucking knew it.
I fucking told you she was qualified.

1485
01:03:26,461 --> 01:03:30,450
She's just good at talking about what
that girl you'd met Cosmin he wasn't a

1486
01:03:30,451 --> 01:03:31,960
nice guy.
Oh,

1487
01:03:31,970 --> 01:03:36,540
I met Cosby at uh,
our synea one time cause I'm a million

1488
01:03:36,541 --> 01:03:38,010
years old.
Um,

1489
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:42,540
I went to our,
I met a woman named joy dolce,

1490
01:03:42,541 --> 01:03:44,730
he used to be in the talent department,
ed,

1491
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:48,000
uh,
Arcenio and she was friends with Dave

1492
01:03:48,001 --> 01:03:49,500
because Dave,
you did our scenario and whatever,

1493
01:03:49,501 --> 01:03:50,970
whatever.
So she would like just go,

1494
01:03:50,971 --> 01:03:52,080
hey,
come by the show today.

1495
01:03:52,530 --> 01:03:54,810
This is like in when our CEO was on the
original,

1496
01:03:54,811 --> 01:03:59,811
like in 94.
So I went by one day and cosby was the

1497
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:05,840
guest and he like,
and he just like kind of fucking berated

1498
01:04:07,051 --> 01:04:12,051
me about like he was talking about the
history of slavery and he's like,

1499
01:04:12,870 --> 01:04:15,630
and then the Dutch man came and he
pointed to me and I was like,

1500
01:04:15,631 --> 01:04:16,590
I'm not Dutch.

1501
01:04:17,010 --> 01:04:18,500
And he was,
and he just like didn't bite on.

1502
01:04:18,501 --> 01:04:19,334
It was like,
okay.

1503
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:24,460
But it was just that he was just a
really condescending dude and I was 19,

1504
01:04:25,951 --> 01:04:26,910
so,
you know,

1505
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:30,000
he had a right to be condescending,
but not really,

1506
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:33,330
but
I'll whatever.

1507
01:04:33,510 --> 01:04:37,650
Like I bill cosby is a brilliant fucking
guy.

1508
01:04:37,890 --> 01:04:38,460
And,
uh,

1509
01:04:38,460 --> 01:04:40,020
but I just,
he's just not,

1510
01:04:40,250 --> 01:04:42,130
uh,
uh,

1511
01:04:42,270 --> 01:04:43,350
I wouldn't,
can I,

1512
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:45,840
I mean,
know what I know now he's a real piece

1513
01:04:45,841 --> 01:04:46,674
of garbage,
but,

1514
01:04:47,010 --> 01:04:47,700
but,
uh,

1515
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:50,130
but the,
my interaction with them at that time,

1516
01:04:50,131 --> 01:04:51,540
it was not like,
wasn't pleasant.

1517
01:04:52,050 --> 01:04:53,640
And just seeing how he talked to people,
it's just like,

1518
01:04:53,650 --> 01:04:55,800
yeah,
this guy's a fucking not a good dude.

1519
01:04:56,110 --> 01:04:58,120
Well,
he definitely has an elitist sort of a

1520
01:04:58,121 --> 01:05:00,580
thing.
And I think that elitist sort of a thing

1521
01:05:00,581 --> 01:05:04,930
is one of the ways that he was able to
separate himself from his victims that

1522
01:05:04,931 --> 01:05:07,000
he's better than them.
You know,

1523
01:05:07,001 --> 01:05:09,730
he would behave in these weird ways when
you do these shows.

1524
01:05:09,731 --> 01:05:10,900
I've talked about it before,
but,

1525
01:05:11,590 --> 01:05:12,560
um,
uh,

1526
01:05:12,570 --> 01:05:16,420
I talked to these people that worked
with him in a casino and he would make

1527
01:05:16,421 --> 01:05:21,010
the entire sit down and watch him eat.
Yeah.

1528
01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:24,520
So all the people that worked in the
theater,

1529
01:05:24,580 --> 01:05:27,760
all the people that work the isles,
they would have to come in the room and

1530
01:05:27,761 --> 01:05:29,650
stand there while he ate.
Yeah.

1531
01:05:30,250 --> 01:05:31,660
Then he had,
he had a security guard,

1532
01:05:31,661 --> 01:05:35,830
tuck him into bed at night.
So he climbs into bed and the security

1533
01:05:35,831 --> 01:05:39,240
guard tucks him in and then shuts the
lights out and shuts the door.

1534
01:05:39,270 --> 01:05:40,810
Something similar to that.
Yeah.

1535
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:42,910
Uh,
yeah.

1536
01:05:43,330 --> 01:05:46,180
So he had this thing like I m p
superior.

1537
01:05:46,260 --> 01:05:47,800
Yeah.
I'm superior.

1538
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:50,620
I'm bill cosby.
I'm Dr Cosby.

1539
01:05:50,830 --> 01:05:52,160
Call me doctor.
Yeah.

1540
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:54,850
I mean the doctor cosby thing.
You should try me fucking crazy.

1541
01:05:54,851 --> 01:05:55,630
Yeah.
Oh,

1542
01:05:55,630 --> 01:05:58,090
Chuck d from public enemy broke my
fucking heart.

1543
01:05:58,330 --> 01:06:02,140
Cause on twitter he was talking about
like at one on the accusation started,

1544
01:06:02,141 --> 01:06:05,170
you know,
this is all a smear campaign against Dr

1545
01:06:05,170 --> 01:06:05,620
Cosby.
And I'm like,

1546
01:06:05,620 --> 01:06:08,200
come on man,
he's not a doctor.

1547
01:06:08,860 --> 01:06:10,690
He's not a real doctor.
Don't say that.

1548
01:06:10,691 --> 01:06:13,360
And they took that doctor away too now.
Yeah.

1549
01:06:13,730 --> 01:06:14,870
Uh,
yeah.

1550
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:19,900
I mean I get Dave talked about in his
last special that thing like the heat

1551
01:06:22,151 --> 01:06:23,330
rapes,
but he saves thing.

1552
01:06:23,850 --> 01:06:28,850
Um,
Bill cosby's is an important dude to

1553
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:31,160
black American culture in history.
He's,

1554
01:06:31,161 --> 01:06:35,270
well just culture,
but to culture.

1555
01:06:35,271 --> 01:06:38,360
Yes.
But he's the first black dude to win an

1556
01:06:38,361 --> 01:06:40,610
emmy.
He's the first black dude to do well.

1557
01:06:40,611 --> 01:06:41,930
A lot of shit.
Right.

1558
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:43,790
And did,
did it the right way.

1559
01:06:44,060 --> 01:06:45,770
I mean,
he had an animated show to the people

1560
01:06:45,771 --> 01:06:49,040
forgot about fat Albert.
That was a huge hint and blind people

1561
01:06:49,041 --> 01:06:49,930
didn't forget about this.
Yeah.

1562
01:06:50,420 --> 01:06:51,670
It's hard to find now.
Yeah.

1563
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:52,600
Right.
Yeah.

1564
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:56,180
Um,
and like just a huge impact.

1565
01:06:56,181 --> 01:06:58,370
And it was a real loss for black people.
Like,

1566
01:06:58,580 --> 01:07:02,960
so a guy like Chuck d who was eminently
respectable is like,

1567
01:07:02,990 --> 01:07:04,490
yeah,
there's a mourning period.

1568
01:07:04,910 --> 01:07:07,040
You know what I mean?
There's got to be careful when you pull

1569
01:07:07,041 --> 01:07:09,110
the trigger on calling it a smear
campaign.

1570
01:07:09,140 --> 01:07:10,100
Oh,
I totally agree.

1571
01:07:10,180 --> 01:07:13,100
And it's entirely possible that your
heroes a piece of shit and yeah.

1572
01:07:13,310 --> 01:07:15,580
And people can have both qualities,
they guess

1573
01:07:15,670 --> 01:07:19,070
amazing at something and very important,
but also be

1574
01:07:19,150 --> 01:07:19,983
terrible.
Yeah.

1575
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:22,770
I have a,
I don't even know if I believe it,

1576
01:07:22,771 --> 01:07:27,771
but I had the thought that like Cosby,
if the kink came before the talent,

1577
01:07:31,950 --> 01:07:35,460
meaning I know I like poisoning people,
right.

1578
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:40,880
How do I put myself in a position to be
able to plausibly poison women?

1579
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:47,940
Leave subconsciously.
That's how people work.

1580
01:07:47,941 --> 01:07:52,941
I honestly believe that there's like in
the unconscious that you go,

1581
01:07:53,281 --> 01:07:57,090
I have this thing cause that's not a
thing that you just develop.

1582
01:07:57,091 --> 01:07:58,480
I don't think.
I think that.

1583
01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:03,150
And that's also not even a power,
that's not even a power thing.

1584
01:08:03,330 --> 01:08:05,820
That's some other shit.
It is power.

1585
01:08:05,821 --> 01:08:09,070
But it's like sociopathy it's not just
like I,

1586
01:08:09,090 --> 01:08:14,090
it's not like Harvey Weinstein is like a
to me is like the casting couch run

1587
01:08:15,861 --> 01:08:16,640
amuck.

1588
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:18,050
You know what I mean?
Like I want,

1589
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:19,370
come on,
fuck me.

1590
01:08:19,670 --> 01:08:20,331
Like,
come on.

1591
01:08:20,331 --> 01:08:21,560
No,
you're a hot actress.

1592
01:08:21,590 --> 01:08:24,290
I got power.
Like I thought that's how it works.

1593
01:08:24,390 --> 01:08:26,060
Yeah.
Like I thought that's kind of the way

1594
01:08:26,061 --> 01:08:27,980
the game was played,
uh,

1595
01:08:28,220 --> 01:08:30,320
with cosby.
I mean,

1596
01:08:30,830 --> 01:08:32,750
having said that,
a lot of harvey ship was just straight

1597
01:08:32,751 --> 01:08:33,440
rap.
So,

1598
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:34,130
yeah.
Um,

1599
01:08:34,130 --> 01:08:35,780
but the fact that they were all
actresses,

1600
01:08:35,781 --> 01:08:38,480
I don't think it's like a,
a coincidence.

1601
01:08:38,950 --> 01:08:41,960
Um,
but with cosby it's like

1602
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:47,750
that probably existed when he was 15.
I don't know.

1603
01:08:48,140 --> 01:08:49,700
I think it's entirely,
we,

1604
01:08:49,790 --> 01:08:52,760
I've been talking about this as well,
that I think that there was a time when

1605
01:08:52,761 --> 01:08:55,850
that was normal.
I think there was a time where slipping

1606
01:08:55,851 --> 01:08:58,730
a mickey into someone's drink was
something that a lot of men did.

1607
01:08:58,820 --> 01:08:59,960
Yeah.
I think it was,

1608
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:04,370
we looked at things in a different way,
just like we look at hitting women.

1609
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:05,480
Yeah.
In a different way.

1610
01:09:05,481 --> 01:09:08,600
Like you go watch those old movies.
The women got smacked all the time.

1611
01:09:08,620 --> 01:09:09,960
It was normal.
Yeah.

1612
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:13,670
The leading man,
Steve McQueen would smack the shit out

1613
01:09:13,671 --> 01:09:14,570
of women.
Yeah.

1614
01:09:14,990 --> 01:09:15,651
Frankly,
my dear,

1615
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:16,640
I don't give it to him.
Yeah.

1616
01:09:16,850 --> 01:09:21,650
Try and slap it a woman now in a movie,
you try it and be the hero.

1617
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:22,790
Yeah.
I mean it's again,

1618
01:09:22,791 --> 01:09:25,790
what we're talking about massive
cultural evolution happening.

1619
01:09:25,790 --> 01:09:27,230
Right.
The also was that thing of like,

1620
01:09:27,260 --> 01:09:28,490
oh,
women aren't people,

1621
01:09:28,730 --> 01:09:29,563
right?
Eh,

1622
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:31,210
Eh,
there was some else,

1623
01:09:31,260 --> 01:09:32,750
it's a woman.
Do you know the,

1624
01:09:32,810 --> 01:09:35,810
what the real term for a faggot is?
What do you mean?

1625
01:09:35,990 --> 01:09:38,030
Like the origin?
Yeah.

1626
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:38,953
Yeah.
What?

1627
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:40,940
It's a bundle of sticks.
Yeah.

1628
01:09:40,970 --> 01:09:44,840
Right.
Well a woman was thought to be a bundle

1629
01:09:44,841 --> 01:09:49,280
of sticks was used for a woman.
She's burdensome.

1630
01:09:49,490 --> 01:09:51,530
Like a bundle of sticks.
Yeah.

1631
01:09:51,590 --> 01:09:56,590
Cause it's difficult to carry around.
So a faggot as a man became a man who's

1632
01:09:57,831 --> 01:10:01,580
like a woman who's burdensome,
like a bundle of sticks.

1633
01:10:01,581 --> 01:10:03,280
It was never anything about what does it
sir,

1634
01:10:03,820 --> 01:10:05,480
here it goes the archaic.
Yeah.

1635
01:10:05,570 --> 01:10:08,660
Take a take a picture.
We don't have to unit of volume.

1636
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:12,950
Yeah.
So this a bundle of sticks thing was

1637
01:10:12,951 --> 01:10:15,230
like how men thought of women.
Like,

1638
01:10:15,231 --> 01:10:17,780
Oh Carrie,
this bitch around Jesus Christ,

1639
01:10:17,781 --> 01:10:20,060
you know,
bundle of sticks is annoying to carry

1640
01:10:20,061 --> 01:10:22,040
around.
So I got a question for you.

1641
01:10:22,220 --> 01:10:23,600
What do you make of

1642
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:25,840
yeah.

1643
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:30,040
With now that we've got Louis,
it's cosby.

1644
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:33,280
I don't think they're even in the same
category for my own,

1645
01:10:33,310 --> 01:10:36,100
for just for the sake of argument,
prior beat,

1646
01:10:36,101 --> 01:10:37,330
his wife,
coke addict,

1647
01:10:37,420 --> 01:10:38,253
et Cetera,
et cetera.

1648
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:41,470
Um,
do you think that there is a

1649
01:10:41,471 --> 01:10:42,520
correlation?

1650
01:10:43,660 --> 01:10:44,050
Okay.

1651
01:10:44,050 --> 01:10:49,050
Between comedic excellence and a
degenerate behavior.

1652
01:10:51,340 --> 01:10:54,250
Yes.
That sort of why I said it to the crowd

1653
01:10:54,251 --> 01:10:57,880
the other night I go by the way,
the ability jerking off on your stomach

1654
01:10:58,360 --> 01:11:02,620
and writing amazing jokes are roommates.
Yeah.

1655
01:11:02,790 --> 01:11:05,440
By their car.
It's like can I can't,

1656
01:11:05,441 --> 01:11:08,920
it's like a hey,
we need you guys to think irrationally

1657
01:11:08,921 --> 01:11:10,000
about everything.
Yeah.

1658
01:11:10,030 --> 01:11:11,680
How about Kennison here's another one.
Yeah.

1659
01:11:11,790 --> 01:11:14,130
Hix Yes.
And that'll hex wasn't it was

1660
01:11:14,140 --> 01:11:15,660
his Hicks,
the Derma deviant.

1661
01:11:15,690 --> 01:11:18,780
He was into
pornography.

1662
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:19,770
I'm not,
yeah,

1663
01:11:19,770 --> 01:11:22,020
I mean like dirt bag.
Like,

1664
01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:24,010
like uh,
not malevolent,

1665
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:25,370
malevolent.
I mean I feel like

1666
01:11:25,490 --> 01:11:29,670
Hicks is probably with more conscious so
we didn't do anything to women but you

1667
01:11:29,671 --> 01:11:32,100
know like friends who worked with them
and say like,

1668
01:11:32,101 --> 01:11:32,731
Hey,
we're going out.

1669
01:11:32,731 --> 01:11:34,550
You want to come out now I'm going to go
back and check off.

1670
01:11:34,580 --> 01:11:35,560
Like yeah,
it just,

1671
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:37,590
it was just sitting to watching porn and
pten off.

1672
01:11:38,380 --> 01:11:40,030
You know,
it's funny I was talking about,

1673
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:43,270
cause yeah,
we both Louis since you've known him

1674
01:11:43,271 --> 01:11:46,870
since 1989 probably I don't,
I never knew around them.

1675
01:11:46,990 --> 01:11:50,200
I would see him like once a year,
twice a year,

1676
01:11:50,201 --> 01:11:51,034
somewhere in say hi.

1677
01:11:51,470 --> 01:11:54,050
Um,
I know you way better than I know him.

1678
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:55,040
Yeah.
Uh,

1679
01:11:55,130 --> 01:11:59,210
the,
so I remember when I moved to New York

1680
01:11:59,211 --> 01:12:04,211
in 91 and was in the comedy club scene
in 92 93 94 in New York.

1681
01:12:05,030 --> 01:12:08,060
I was,
I couldn't believe the amount of jerking

1682
01:12:08,061 --> 01:12:11,340
off that was going on.
I just remember her like,

1683
01:12:11,341 --> 01:12:14,100
why is everyone constantly talking about
like,

1684
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:19,400
what the fuck is going to Louie's
apartment four to shoot,

1685
01:12:20,330 --> 01:12:22,980
uh,
movies like his shorts that he used to

1686
01:12:22,981 --> 01:12:25,770
make.
I would like pa on them and uh,

1687
01:12:26,310 --> 01:12:31,310
and it always smelled gross.
Like Jay Moore was constantly,

1688
01:12:32,391 --> 01:12:34,520
Jay Moore worry me and I were roommates
for a bit.

1689
01:12:34,521 --> 01:12:36,590
He jerked off on one of my socks,
like,

1690
01:12:36,591 --> 01:12:39,680
just like,
like why is everyone jerking off all of

1691
01:12:39,681 --> 01:12:40,730
that?
Just like,

1692
01:12:40,820 --> 01:12:43,100
what is the,
what the fuck is happening?

1693
01:12:43,270 --> 01:12:44,460
That's rape.
Yeah.

1694
01:12:44,650 --> 01:12:46,510
No,
you know what's funny is I was wondering

1695
01:12:46,511 --> 01:12:48,490
like today,
yeah,

1696
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:51,340
I was thinking about the Jay thing again
because I'm,

1697
01:12:51,430 --> 01:12:55,000
I'm of the mind that like
again,

1698
01:12:55,420 --> 01:12:58,390
Louie was more gross than,
than uh,

1699
01:12:58,570 --> 01:13:00,170
malicious and discuss,
uh,

1700
01:13:00,310 --> 01:13:02,920
malicious and criminal.
I'm just gross.

1701
01:13:03,070 --> 01:13:04,470
That what he did.
I think it was just,

1702
01:13:05,420 --> 01:13:08,860
we did it to a man.
It takes on more ominous tones when he's

1703
01:13:08,861 --> 01:13:09,700
doing it to women.

1704
01:13:10,710 --> 01:13:11,940
Completely agree.
Yeah.

1705
01:13:11,990 --> 01:13:13,020
Uh,
it's,

1706
01:13:13,021 --> 01:13:13,850
I mean,
I'm not,

1707
01:13:13,850 --> 01:13:15,300
I don't want,
it's not a crime,

1708
01:13:15,301 --> 01:13:16,230
right?
No,

1709
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:16,651
no,
no.

1710
01:13:16,651 --> 01:13:17,484
I don't think so.

1711
01:13:18,170 --> 01:13:20,330
It's just sad.
It's nothing like cosby.

1712
01:13:20,331 --> 01:13:22,310
It's just pathetic.
It's weird.

1713
01:13:22,460 --> 01:13:24,080
And you know,
w w has a crop,

1714
01:13:24,140 --> 01:13:27,740
some conversations with,
uh,

1715
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:32,510
Eliza slessinger.
She was saying that men would say things

1716
01:13:32,511 --> 01:13:35,150
to her when she first started.
Docs wasn't very good.

1717
01:13:35,151 --> 01:13:37,460
You know,
she just started out and these guys were

1718
01:13:37,461 --> 01:13:39,980
like established guys and they would
treat her as if like,

1719
01:13:39,981 --> 01:13:44,510
you're below me and you're always going
to be below me and I can get away with

1720
01:13:44,511 --> 01:13:46,670
saying whenever I wanted to you,
cause you're less than me.

1721
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,250
And she was,
and I kind of feel like that's probably

1722
01:13:49,251 --> 01:13:51,950
why he did that to those girls.
Like he was above them,

1723
01:13:52,250 --> 01:13:55,310
they were below him and it was not just,
hey,

1724
01:13:55,311 --> 01:13:58,250
I want to jerk off in front of you.
It's like you have to watch me jerk off

1725
01:13:58,251 --> 01:13:59,480
because I'm above you.

1726
01:13:59,860 --> 01:14:01,460
You know what's the thing you said
earlier?

1727
01:14:01,461 --> 01:14:06,220
It was relevant,
which is getting hard right from that.

1728
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:07,450
How can you,
yeah,

1729
01:14:07,451 --> 01:14:09,030
that's the thing that's like,
but I,

1730
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:12,580
but then it's also like you don't your
kinks and all that shit,

1731
01:14:13,180 --> 01:14:15,580
it just falls on you.
You don't pick that.

1732
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:19,090
That's even a direct correlation.
Most kinks are just like,

1733
01:14:19,091 --> 01:14:20,560
I dunno,
like,

1734
01:14:21,070 --> 01:14:23,790
uh,
being hung off the roof everybody,

1735
01:14:23,830 --> 01:14:24,663
you know what I mean?
Like,

1736
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:28,450
uh,
but yeah,

1737
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:31,300
that's the thing of like the,
the getting hard thing,

1738
01:14:31,301 --> 01:14:32,470
but also,
uh,

1739
01:14:35,050 --> 01:14:37,180
fuck I the whole thing.
It is sad.

1740
01:14:37,181 --> 01:14:39,190
It's fucked up.
But I actually think he'll be,

1741
01:14:39,820 --> 01:14:42,100
he'll be in a year and a half,
he'll be back.

1742
01:14:42,540 --> 01:14:43,720
He thinks I'm stronger than ever.
Yeah.

1743
01:14:44,110 --> 01:14:46,150
Cause now he's got something to talk
about for,

1744
01:14:46,210 --> 01:14:48,070
yeah,
it's going to be,

1745
01:14:48,310 --> 01:14:50,080
it's going to be a lot of dudes at the
show.

1746
01:14:50,380 --> 01:14:53,050
It's going to be 90% dudes,
but I've asked the crowd,

1747
01:14:53,051 --> 01:14:55,210
I've asked probably five or six
different crowds.

1748
01:14:55,540 --> 01:14:59,880
If Louis was doing the show after this,
would you go and 70% of the people

1749
01:14:59,910 --> 01:15:01,180
applaud?
Yeah.

1750
01:15:01,570 --> 01:15:03,190
They would want to see what the fuck he
has to say.

1751
01:15:04,060 --> 01:15:05,770
Yes.
I think he should go on stage.

1752
01:15:05,771 --> 01:15:07,030
The first words out of his mouth should
be,

1753
01:15:07,031 --> 01:15:09,390
well,
I asked I there's,

1754
01:15:09,470 --> 01:15:11,870
I believe light should just come up and
he's jerking off.

1755
01:15:17,870 --> 01:15:18,940
Yeah,
that's a great idea.

1756
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:21,010
And I'm just like lights down and just
like,

1757
01:15:21,430 --> 01:15:23,920
yeah,
I think what he did was freaky and

1758
01:15:23,921 --> 01:15:24,970
weird,
but I think Louie,

1759
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,370
I don't think louise a monster.
I don't really know him very well,

1760
01:15:27,371 --> 01:15:29,080
but I don't,
I don't think he's a bad person.

1761
01:15:29,081 --> 01:15:30,160
He's always been friendly to me.

1762
01:15:30,290 --> 01:15:31,790
He's not a bad person.
Like

1763
01:15:33,290 --> 01:15:35,300
he's not like,
he's not a bad,

1764
01:15:35,301 --> 01:15:37,040
he's not.
He's also,

1765
01:15:37,250 --> 01:15:40,910
again,
I don't want to be like defending a sex

1766
01:15:40,911 --> 01:15:43,670
criminal.
If it's a power thing.

1767
01:15:43,700 --> 01:15:46,340
He the more powerful we got,
the lessee did it.

1768
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:47,370
Yeah.

1769
01:15:47,370 --> 01:15:48,480
That's the weird thing,
right?

1770
01:15:48,510 --> 01:15:50,370
It's like,
I think he realized that what he did was

1771
01:15:50,371 --> 01:15:54,990
fucked up and like he had these crazy
urges and he did it and then as time

1772
01:15:54,991 --> 01:15:56,820
went on he stopped doing it and he's
like,

1773
01:15:56,850 --> 01:15:58,860
I'm a prisoner to some shit that I know

1774
01:15:58,900 --> 01:16:00,460
did.
And if he had just got in front of it,

1775
01:16:00,461 --> 01:16:04,510
I feel like if he had just a,
if he had just talked about it in a

1776
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:09,190
letter,
men talked about fucking his staff on

1777
01:16:09,191 --> 01:16:12,670
the air and no one cared.
Well,

1778
01:16:12,730 --> 01:16:17,730
letterman just went straight.
Do you mean 100% confessional?

1779
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:19,470
Yeah.
Which I think Louis could,

1780
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:22,420
I think he just mishandled it.
Liked having sex with the people that

1781
01:16:22,421 --> 01:16:25,060
work with.
And by the way,

1782
01:16:25,061 --> 01:16:27,220
I'm being blocked.
I talked to the lady about this

1783
01:16:27,220 --> 01:16:27,520
yesterday.
He goes,

1784
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:30,170
have you watched it?
He's getting laughs the whole time.

1785
01:16:30,220 --> 01:16:31,240
Yeah.
Yeah.

1786
01:16:31,270 --> 01:16:33,990
Like the whole time I'm getting big
labs.

1787
01:16:34,020 --> 01:16:35,470
He was brilliant.
Yeah.

1788
01:16:35,471 --> 01:16:37,020
I miss him.
But again,

1789
01:16:37,090 --> 01:16:40,000
the other thing,
it's like the irony of like Netflix

1790
01:16:40,001 --> 01:16:40,870
didn't pull his show.

1791
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:44,420
Yeah.
But he was only having sex with people,

1792
01:16:44,510 --> 01:16:47,690
but here's the thing,
having sex with people back then,

1793
01:16:47,720 --> 01:16:52,720
but that you not want a piece of power
now that's can sit again.

1794
01:16:53,031 --> 01:16:55,130
We're talking about four years ago.
That's crazy.

1795
01:16:55,160 --> 01:16:56,840
You've got to rate,
it feels like it's changed.

1796
01:16:57,260 --> 01:16:59,450
What's changed?
Is it just everyone?

1797
01:16:59,750 --> 01:17:04,400
I think the Harvey Weinstein thing was
so fucking gross and he's such a monster

1798
01:17:04,730 --> 01:17:08,870
that everybody's like complete.
I think there's this ripple effect and

1799
01:17:08,871 --> 01:17:13,340
that we're,
we're like way beyond normal reactions

1800
01:17:13,341 --> 01:17:15,790
for things like Matt Lauer.
Yeah.

1801
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:18,860
I'm still trying to figure out what Matt
Lauer did that got him fired.

1802
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:23,600
He had sex with someone on staff.
Yeah.

1803
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:28,520
I think he had sex with someone on staff
that probably felt like she couldn't

1804
01:17:28,521 --> 01:17:31,670
stop that.
That would be the,

1805
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:34,700
that would be that sort of rub.
I don't know.

1806
01:17:34,730 --> 01:17:36,080
You see?
I don't,

1807
01:17:36,890 --> 01:17:38,330
I don't want a victim shame.

1808
01:17:38,390 --> 01:17:39,740
Right.
You don't know.

1809
01:17:39,890 --> 01:17:42,530
You don't know what really happened.
I don't know his version.

1810
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:46,370
I don't even know her version.
I just know the third hand version.

1811
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:49,790
You know,
like I read one that he had sex with

1812
01:17:49,791 --> 01:17:53,630
some girl until she blacked out and like
Matt Lauer likes to fuck.

1813
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:56,120
Yeah.
He's throwing in his office girl sir.

1814
01:17:56,570 --> 01:17:59,390
And then the other thing was that he had
a button at his desk or you can lock the

1815
01:17:59,391 --> 01:18:00,620
door.
That,

1816
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:02,900
yeah,
that to me is less,

1817
01:18:02,901 --> 01:18:03,500
uh,
uh,

1818
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:06,410
rape trap then than it is just like a
fucking,

1819
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:11,440
I don't want to have to get up and go
when you're the opposite that big and

1820
01:18:12,290 --> 01:18:13,770
you're like,
fuck it,

1821
01:18:14,030 --> 01:18:17,720
it's probably,
I don't want to walk 40 feet right.

1822
01:18:17,900 --> 01:18:19,610
Every time I need to shut the door.
Well,

1823
01:18:19,620 --> 01:18:22,040
it's also,
he's writing right when you,

1824
01:18:22,041 --> 01:18:23,660
right.
You don't want to be disturbed.

1825
01:18:23,660 --> 01:18:25,700
You're just like,
it's rather just let me just lock the

1826
01:18:25,701 --> 01:18:27,440
fucking door and lock it into this
thing.

1827
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:30,560
I don't even think it was writing.
I think it's just like a convenience

1828
01:18:30,561 --> 01:18:31,730
thing maybe.
Um,

1829
01:18:32,060 --> 01:18:34,460
but there was no,
um,

1830
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:38,420
the only abuses that he was having sex
with someone who was above,

1831
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:39,770
below him.
Right.

1832
01:18:39,830 --> 01:18:42,260
There wasn't like he,
you know,

1833
01:18:42,261 --> 01:18:45,020
he didn't chase him down like harvey did
or you know,

1834
01:18:45,021 --> 01:18:48,920
offer them a Gig or another friend of
mine said some interesting in which he

1835
01:18:48,921 --> 01:18:50,030
said,
uh,

1836
01:18:50,660 --> 01:18:54,830
until dating people you work with is
illegal.

1837
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:56,510
This is never gonna stop.
Yeah.

1838
01:18:56,511 --> 01:19:00,050
Whitney's got a great joke about that
that she's doing right now about working

1839
01:19:00,051 --> 01:19:00,831
in an office.
You know,

1840
01:19:00,831 --> 01:19:02,390
cause she works on Roseanne now.
Yeah.

1841
01:19:02,660 --> 01:19:05,030
It's a,
it's their world,

1842
01:19:05,090 --> 01:19:06,110
you know,
it's like yeah,

1843
01:19:06,410 --> 01:19:11,410
when men and women are in yeah.
And you can't like where are they going

1844
01:19:12,201 --> 01:19:13,090
to meet people,
right.

1845
01:19:13,340 --> 01:19:16,700
And you're working all day so it's most
of your day,

1846
01:19:16,730 --> 01:19:20,660
most of your life is with these people
also in the same way that they serve

1847
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:24,920
like lunch at these places now or they
have like we play foosball and all that

1848
01:19:24,921 --> 01:19:27,800
shit at Google.
Like we have slides and ball pits just

1849
01:19:27,801 --> 01:19:32,060
like you can fuck people here.
Like that's what our thing,

1850
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:34,400
one of our incentives were all allowed
to.

1851
01:19:34,401 --> 01:19:36,740
They will do,
they want to keep people on campus,

1852
01:19:36,890 --> 01:19:39,920
but as soon as you stop he make that
illegal.

1853
01:19:40,170 --> 01:19:41,440
Even if you,
if you decide,

1854
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:43,940
okay,
our rules are you cannot have sex with

1855
01:19:43,941 --> 01:19:48,170
anybody you work with like den,
you want to fuck everybody you work with

1856
01:19:48,290 --> 01:19:50,920
then
show,

1857
01:19:51,290 --> 01:19:52,550
right?
Yes.

1858
01:19:52,551 --> 01:19:54,840
But you can't do it.
Okay.

1859
01:19:54,841 --> 01:19:57,230
That speaks to why can't you if you,
you,

1860
01:19:57,290 --> 01:20:00,800
but sometimes it does work.
Like if a man and a woman a working

1861
01:20:00,801 --> 01:20:03,590
together like didn't Jimmy Kimmel like
Mary,

1862
01:20:03,591 --> 01:20:05,450
like one of his head writers or
something like that.

1863
01:20:05,630 --> 01:20:06,710
Yeah,
he did.

1864
01:20:07,330 --> 01:20:08,250
Right.
Again,

1865
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:11,940
is he a monster?
She belonged it.

1866
01:20:12,030 --> 01:20:13,080
Yes,
she was.

1867
01:20:13,110 --> 01:20:15,480
That's what it does.
I know.

1868
01:20:15,570 --> 01:20:16,980
I know.
That's the thing.

1869
01:20:16,981 --> 01:20:20,610
That's the irony of all this shit.
There was a thing at the Leno did his

1870
01:20:20,611 --> 01:20:22,860
last show.
It was like,

1871
01:20:22,861 --> 01:20:27,420
uh,
the 25 kids that were born to couples

1872
01:20:27,421 --> 01:20:30,960
who met on the show and I was watching
it going like this.

1873
01:20:30,961 --> 01:20:32,790
All the sexual harassments.
All crime.

1874
01:20:32,820 --> 01:20:33,660
Yeah.
These are,

1875
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:36,830
this is a,
this is a perp walk basically.

1876
01:20:36,850 --> 01:20:39,860
It's not if the two people really in
[inaudible] water

1877
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:43,450
comic,
no,

1878
01:20:44,230 --> 01:20:45,880
dated one when I was 21

1879
01:20:47,330 --> 01:20:49,640
I don't even really like sleeping with
wage on it.

1880
01:20:49,641 --> 01:20:50,810
Like,
I really tried to avoid it.

1881
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:52,460
Like I,
I try everything,

1882
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:54,830
everything in my power.
I can't say I've never done it,

1883
01:20:54,831 --> 01:20:57,700
but I really try not to.
Yeah.

1884
01:20:58,310 --> 01:21:02,240
Because I don't even think a lot of
times you're attracted to them.

1885
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:07,040
I think you're attracted to the dynamic.
I think you're attracted to like the

1886
01:21:07,041 --> 01:21:10,220
uniform and like you're working and
they're working.

1887
01:21:10,230 --> 01:21:13,520
You're not supposed to and did a,
and then you see him off campus in

1888
01:21:13,521 --> 01:21:18,010
normal clothes and you're like
normal.

1889
01:21:18,090 --> 01:21:19,600
Yeah.
Yeah.

1890
01:21:19,770 --> 01:21:22,040
You go put your outfit on your apron on.
Listen.

1891
01:21:22,041 --> 01:21:25,280
How about you pretend to work at a diner
and I'll stop in for a coffee and then

1892
01:21:25,281 --> 01:21:26,220
we'll talk.
Yeah.

1893
01:21:26,870 --> 01:21:29,230
How was your experience with the dating
somebody but just,

1894
01:21:29,690 --> 01:21:34,340
I just think there's too much.
I want to be a comic going on.

1895
01:21:34,341 --> 01:21:35,990
We were both 21.
We're both,

1896
01:21:35,991 --> 01:21:39,320
uh,
both like really raw,

1897
01:21:39,330 --> 01:21:41,210
open.
My daughter's trying it out.

1898
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:43,130
Didn't know what the fuck the future
held in store for us.

1899
01:21:43,340 --> 01:21:45,050
It was just too much comedy talk.
And I was like,

1900
01:21:45,051 --> 01:21:46,100
Gosh,
she's too much like me.

1901
01:21:46,580 --> 01:21:48,560
But she was fucking funny.
And,

1902
01:21:48,561 --> 01:21:50,330
uh,
she was one of the few people that it

1903
01:21:50,331 --> 01:21:51,051
was like,
wow.

1904
01:21:51,051 --> 01:21:54,500
Like she really could be like legit.
Like when,

1905
01:21:54,501 --> 01:21:57,720
when we were all open micros together
and it never worked out for her.

1906
01:21:57,830 --> 01:21:59,210
She's quit.
Yeah.

1907
01:21:59,211 --> 01:21:59,901
Gas.
I mean,

1908
01:21:59,901 --> 01:22:02,150
I lost touch with her about it last time
I talked to her.

1909
01:22:02,151 --> 01:22:04,640
I think we were both like 22,
23,

1910
01:22:04,641 --> 01:22:08,630
something like that.
And then I'd heard somebody ran into her

1911
01:22:08,631 --> 01:22:10,310
at an open mic night,
like a year later,

1912
01:22:10,311 --> 01:22:12,410
but she had never gotten out of the open
mic scene,

1913
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:14,390
you know,
so she was in the open mic scene for

1914
01:22:14,391 --> 01:22:16,520
two,
three years and never figured out how to

1915
01:22:16,521 --> 01:22:18,230
make money and now,
you know,

1916
01:22:18,231 --> 01:22:21,860
just didn't have whatever it is that
some people have the,

1917
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:25,780
the fucking driving ambition to,
to figure it out.

1918
01:22:26,300 --> 01:22:27,610
I don't,
the,

1919
01:22:27,890 --> 01:22:29,920
one of the reasons I wouldn't date,
uh,

1920
01:22:30,350 --> 01:22:32,780
another community is,
I don't like that ambition.

1921
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:34,610
Pardon me?
Meaning like,

1922
01:22:34,611 --> 01:22:35,390
I,
I,

1923
01:22:35,390 --> 01:22:37,340
I have it.
I'm,

1924
01:22:37,460 --> 01:22:38,450
I,
I,

1925
01:22:38,540 --> 01:22:41,120
it does like drive me,
but you don't want to see it.

1926
01:22:41,121 --> 01:22:45,800
And I brought a cd out of it.
I don't want that to be my emotional

1927
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:48,500
support.
The person who thinks that way I think

1928
01:22:48,501 --> 01:22:51,590
or feels what I feel in regards to
achievement.

1929
01:22:52,310 --> 01:22:53,360
Yeah.
Especially

1930
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:57,170
like status and you know,
recognition.

1931
01:22:57,171 --> 01:23:00,860
Getting the recognition from your peers
and all that kind of crazy shit and

1932
01:23:00,861 --> 01:23:04,880
craving it.
And where are you with all that stuff

1933
01:23:05,650 --> 01:23:06,550
with recognition?

1934
01:23:06,550 --> 01:23:08,790
Yeah.
Um,

1935
01:23:08,990 --> 01:23:11,470
I'm everything right now cause I'm
pretty comfortable.

1936
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:13,090
I was going to say,
yeah,

1937
01:23:13,110 --> 01:23:18,110
I dunno how you are with like a
congratulations or compliments or stuff,

1938
01:23:18,131 --> 01:23:20,560
but you've done really well for
yourself.

1939
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:23,350
Thank you.
Like you've done like this is fucking

1940
01:23:23,351 --> 01:23:24,850
impressive.
I don't like,

1941
01:23:24,851 --> 01:23:25,810
I was just thinking of that the other
day.

1942
01:23:25,811 --> 01:23:27,670
It was like you don't get a lot of
press,

1943
01:23:27,671 --> 01:23:30,070
you don't probably do,
you probably get offers all the time and

1944
01:23:30,071 --> 01:23:34,480
just don't do it.
But you've fucking built a great thing.

1945
01:23:34,810 --> 01:23:37,720
Like a great,
like first of all to say like,

1946
01:23:37,721 --> 01:23:39,310
I'll,
I'll tell you a common with somebody

1947
01:23:39,311 --> 01:23:41,440
else gave you,
Chris Rock said about you.

1948
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:44,500
He goes,
Joe Rogan basically physically willed

1949
01:23:44,501 --> 01:23:48,790
himself into being a great comic.
I don't even know what Chris meant by

1950
01:23:48,791 --> 01:23:50,110
that.
But I know it's common.

1951
01:23:50,111 --> 01:23:51,280
Like you just were like,
no,

1952
01:23:51,281 --> 01:23:54,790
I'm going to do that and I'm going to be
a great comic.

1953
01:23:54,790 --> 01:23:58,060
And you became a great comment.
That's to say nothing of all this stuff.

1954
01:23:58,330 --> 01:24:03,330
That's the nothing of like building an
atmosphere where two men can talk about

1955
01:24:05,010 --> 01:24:07,710
rape.
They were building and atmosphere.

1956
01:24:07,730 --> 01:24:11,080
Where you going to have me on?
You're going to have,

1957
01:24:11,890 --> 01:24:13,890
you know,
Alex Jones on,

1958
01:24:13,900 --> 01:24:16,900
you'd have a,
a fucking Neil degrasse Tyson on,

1959
01:24:16,901 --> 01:24:18,540
you're going to have,
um,

1960
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:19,830
the,
the,

1961
01:24:19,930 --> 01:24:22,540
uh,
Milo Yiannopoulos just having all these

1962
01:24:22,541 --> 01:24:27,541
people on and it's this weird cross
section that you built and it's all just

1963
01:24:29,141 --> 01:24:29,681
from like,
oh,

1964
01:24:29,681 --> 01:24:32,400
I'm into that.
It doesn't even seem that calculate it,

1965
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:34,010
how to calculate it at all.
Yeah.

1966
01:24:34,390 --> 01:24:35,560
But it is,
but I,

1967
01:24:35,620 --> 01:24:39,400
but you deserve full,
uh,

1968
01:24:39,970 --> 01:24:40,960
accolades.
Thank you,

1969
01:24:40,961 --> 01:24:41,950
sir.
Appreciate it.

1970
01:24:41,951 --> 01:24:42,480
Yeah.
Wait,

1971
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:43,060
really?
The man,

1972
01:24:43,060 --> 01:24:44,560
like,
it's really like you've done it.

1973
01:24:44,590 --> 01:24:46,840
You not only like you built an empire,
whatever,

1974
01:24:46,841 --> 01:24:49,120
but you've like,
you've,

1975
01:24:49,270 --> 01:24:50,320
you've,
uh,

1976
01:24:51,820 --> 01:24:56,820
you started with your voice and your
interests and worked out inside out.

1977
01:25:00,190 --> 01:25:01,540
Yeah.
You know what I mean?

1978
01:25:01,541 --> 01:25:03,760
Like I'm into that.
I like talking to people.

1979
01:25:03,910 --> 01:25:08,910
I like talking to people about these
five or eight things and then you didn't

1980
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:14,880
and you don't chase.
You don't shondra chase too wealthy and

1981
01:25:16,631 --> 01:25:18,250
old to do it anymore,
but you're not like,

1982
01:25:18,490 --> 01:25:20,170
I got to know,
I got to know a multicam.

1983
01:25:20,590 --> 01:25:23,070
You've done a holding camp but I got to
do with this thing or I got to do with

1984
01:25:23,071 --> 01:25:24,580
that or I got to get,
but I,

1985
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:27,370
if I was on a network,
I get billboards and I get all,

1986
01:25:27,380 --> 01:25:28,870
you know what I mean?
Like you'd get,

1987
01:25:29,110 --> 01:25:30,610
you don't do dumb shit.

1988
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:31,980
No,
I just,

1989
01:25:31,980 --> 01:25:33,510
I'm into what I'm into,
you know,

1990
01:25:33,511 --> 01:25:37,530
and I did dumb shit with fear factor.
I realized from doing fear factor was a

1991
01:25:37,531 --> 01:25:39,360
great education for me.
First of all,

1992
01:25:39,361 --> 01:25:42,720
it gave me a lot of fuck you money,
which was great because then I realized,

1993
01:25:42,721 --> 01:25:44,910
well once you have that like,
oh you really can't,

1994
01:25:44,911 --> 01:25:46,950
it doesn't really matter.
You can really kind of do what you want

1995
01:25:47,060 --> 01:25:49,620
if you don't have to worry about how
your bills are being paid.

1996
01:25:49,740 --> 01:25:53,730
Now you have this freedom.
It's like if they cancel it tomorrow and

1997
01:25:53,731 --> 01:25:54,720
I'm like,
I still have this.

1998
01:25:54,780 --> 01:25:57,240
I didn't spend it all.
I still have a bunch of money and now I

1999
01:25:57,241 --> 01:25:59,280
can make a living doing standup.
I could do whatever I want.

2000
01:26:00,140 --> 01:26:00,380
You

2001
01:26:00,380 --> 01:26:03,830
could not make a living doing stand up.
You need to make a living.

2002
01:26:03,860 --> 01:26:04,310
Right.

2003
01:26:04,310 --> 01:26:06,950
You don't have to write you a,
you don't need to make a living.

2004
01:26:06,990 --> 01:26:07,823
You've got it.
Yeah.

2005
01:26:07,860 --> 01:26:08,870
Good.
Just lay back.

2006
01:26:09,010 --> 01:26:09,801
Yeah.
If you want to.

2007
01:26:09,801 --> 01:26:12,890
But I can never do that.
But I'm just,

2008
01:26:13,220 --> 01:26:16,460
I just decided somewhere along the line
like,

2009
01:26:16,461 --> 01:26:18,280
what am I really interested in?
Yeah.

2010
01:26:18,590 --> 01:26:21,280
You know?
And that to me is the key of like,

2011
01:26:21,290 --> 01:26:24,290
that's kind of where I've gotten in the
last,

2012
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:26,570
literally in the last year.
Cause like the,

2013
01:26:26,571 --> 01:26:29,450
my three Mike's was popular and
successful,

2014
01:26:29,451 --> 01:26:32,840
like creatively and uh,
and like,

2015
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:35,630
you know,
people liked it and critics liked it.

2016
01:26:35,690 --> 01:26:40,690
And um,
and it was the last year is the first

2017
01:26:41,601 --> 01:26:44,870
time I've been like,
am I funny?

2018
01:26:45,230 --> 01:26:46,280
Am I talent?
I'm like,

2019
01:26:46,281 --> 01:26:47,114
no,
I am.

2020
01:26:47,510 --> 01:26:52,510
I am.
So now I can stop doing shit out of who

2021
01:26:53,780 --> 01:26:58,780
you are.
This dumb thing that is mostly paranoia,

2022
01:26:59,210 --> 01:27:00,860
right?
Because when you find,

2023
01:27:00,861 --> 01:27:02,230
when people are like,
what you'd even,

2024
01:27:02,240 --> 01:27:02,780
what do you mean?

2025
01:27:02,780 --> 01:27:05,110
Am I funny?
Or can you write to her kin?

2026
01:27:05,180 --> 01:27:08,360
Like the things that I would actually
consciously think.

2027
01:27:08,740 --> 01:27:11,570
Um,
it's hard when you battle those things

2028
01:27:11,571 --> 01:27:13,760
in your head because they,
they steal,

2029
01:27:14,390 --> 01:27:16,880
they steal your perception.
You know,

2030
01:27:16,900 --> 01:27:18,960
they had such a waste of time,
such a way.

2031
01:27:19,510 --> 01:27:21,350
It's not even a waste.
It's,

2032
01:27:21,380 --> 01:27:24,680
it's maybe the biggest waste of anything
on our,

2033
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:26,510
I like,
it's a,

2034
01:27:26,511 --> 01:27:29,780
it's a,
it's your brain is,

2035
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:33,110
uh,
it's an occupying force in your brain,

2036
01:27:33,140 --> 01:27:36,320
but it's impossible to tell that to
someone who's just starting out or who's

2037
01:27:36,350 --> 01:27:39,590
ambitious and struggling because like
that is all they want.

2038
01:27:39,620 --> 01:27:40,250
They,
they,

2039
01:27:40,250 --> 01:27:44,210
they so desire affirmation to know that,
hey,

2040
01:27:44,211 --> 01:27:45,830
I'm a legit pro.
Yeah.

2041
01:27:45,831 --> 01:27:47,810
And that's the thing is I got enough
affirmation.

2042
01:27:47,811 --> 01:27:50,900
It was three Mikes as popular.
Uh,

2043
01:27:50,990 --> 01:27:53,510
and I use,
this is how dumb the inner voices were,

2044
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:55,100
I would think.

2045
01:27:55,310 --> 01:27:57,110
Yeah.
You can write sketches,

2046
01:27:57,530 --> 01:28:00,260
but you can only write single camera
sketches.

2047
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:01,393
Oh,
that's so cool.

2048
01:28:01,550 --> 01:28:04,670
So then I was like,
you probably can't write multicam

2049
01:28:04,671 --> 01:28:06,590
sketches.
And then Dave hosted snl.

2050
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:11,450
He asked me to help him with it and I
wrote a great sketch and I was like,

2051
01:28:11,480 --> 01:28:13,370
Oh God,
of course he can.

2052
01:28:13,371 --> 01:28:14,320
You could write with,
I know.

2053
01:28:14,330 --> 01:28:14,960
I know.
But I,

2054
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:17,750
it might mean next town was,
I know,

2055
01:28:17,780 --> 01:28:21,320
I know you.
It was so obvious to everyone except me.

2056
01:28:21,321 --> 01:28:23,660
And then I was like,
and then the popularity of three Mikes,

2057
01:28:23,661 --> 01:28:25,010
I was like,
oh,

2058
01:28:25,220 --> 01:28:27,650
it's fulfilling.
It is fulfilling.

2059
01:28:27,651 --> 01:28:31,040
But it's also like you just check it off
the list of like,

2060
01:28:31,070 --> 01:28:31,903
oh,
okay,

2061
01:28:32,120 --> 01:28:35,180
I don't have to pursue this thing.
Like,

2062
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:39,650
uh,
I know that that won't bring me.

2063
01:28:40,460 --> 01:28:43,130
It did bring me fulfillment in that it's
shut the voices up,

2064
01:28:43,670 --> 01:28:45,470
but it didn't bring me fulfillment of
like,

2065
01:28:46,010 --> 01:28:51,010
now when I walk into restaurants,
five people know me and that's changed.

2066
01:28:51,110 --> 01:28:53,450
Like that doesn't sound,
people love that.

2067
01:28:53,570 --> 01:28:56,990
Some people live for that.
I find that to be nothing.

2068
01:28:57,020 --> 01:28:58,400
That's a giant distraction.
Yeah.

2069
01:28:58,401 --> 01:29:00,260
I just find it to be like,
hey,

2070
01:29:00,261 --> 01:29:02,110
you know what time it is.
And then I'm just like,

2071
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:04,530
I don't really remember it like it.
It's gratifying,

2072
01:29:04,531 --> 01:29:06,150
but it's,
I just,

2073
01:29:06,210 --> 01:29:07,980
it doesn't like,
it doesn't,

2074
01:29:08,320 --> 01:29:09,570
uh,
permeate,

2075
01:29:09,690 --> 01:29:11,190
well,
it gets to a place where you're like

2076
01:29:11,310 --> 01:29:16,110
Chris rock where it becomes a problem.
Like if Chris rock goes into spargo or

2077
01:29:16,111 --> 01:29:17,610
wherever,
like all a sudden,

2078
01:29:17,611 --> 01:29:18,390
whoosh.
Yeah.

2079
01:29:18,390 --> 01:29:21,030
Like all eyes are on him.
The paparazzi get notified,

2080
01:29:21,031 --> 01:29:24,060
the waiting out in front with cameras,
people inside or look and he's over

2081
01:29:24,061 --> 01:29:24,751
there.
He's over there.

2082
01:29:24,751 --> 01:29:25,800
He's over there.
He's over there.

2083
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:28,710
There's the,
there's that level where you get,

2084
01:29:28,740 --> 01:29:32,010
where it becomes a giant distraction and
it fucks with your art too.

2085
01:29:32,070 --> 01:29:33,660
Yeah.
Because it's just as good about that

2086
01:29:33,661 --> 01:29:35,550
shit and that he doesn't have,
literally,

2087
01:29:35,800 --> 01:29:37,260
he travels by himself.

2088
01:29:37,320 --> 01:29:39,000
He doesn't have any boys.
Yeah.

2089
01:29:39,001 --> 01:29:42,150
He comes to the comedy store.
No body guards don't know shit pulls in.

2090
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:43,313
Hey,
what's up?

2091
01:29:43,400 --> 01:29:44,670
I'm like,
yeah,

2092
01:29:44,910 --> 01:29:46,520
no,
he's very wise and the guard.

2093
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:48,580
And he knew he had to.
Yeah.

2094
01:29:48,660 --> 01:29:51,750
He like,
I can't have people gas in me.

2095
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:55,620
I'm smart of him.
He's a fucking smart guy though.

2096
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:59,610
You know,
he can see the pitfalls in advance.

2097
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:00,840
Yeah.
He's like,

2098
01:30:00,841 --> 01:30:04,560
which is why he's a great comic.
He's like psychologically aware.

2099
01:30:04,561 --> 01:30:08,100
He's not just delusional and trying to
push something that he's,

2100
01:30:08,101 --> 01:30:10,170
you know,
he's trying to like make work.

2101
01:30:10,240 --> 01:30:11,130
Yeah.
He doesn't,

2102
01:30:11,131 --> 01:30:15,180
he ha we all have blind spots creatively
and personally.

2103
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:20,040
He has maybe the fewest blind spots of
anyone I know.

2104
01:30:20,100 --> 01:30:24,120
Well that's why he was willing to hire
people to help him with his act.

2105
01:30:24,450 --> 01:30:28,200
By the way,
that thing of hiring people,

2106
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:30,540
because I worked on his new hour.

2107
01:30:31,230 --> 01:30:34,110
Here's what it is.
He likes comedy writers.

2108
01:30:34,140 --> 01:30:36,210
Right?
And when you're him,

2109
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:38,640
he there,
you don't have any peers.

2110
01:30:39,150 --> 01:30:42,420
No one's walking up to rock and giving
them tags.

2111
01:30:42,440 --> 01:30:45,000
Right.
Of course would cause I know him,

2112
01:30:45,060 --> 01:30:48,090
but like most like he doesn't really
have like peers,

2113
01:30:48,091 --> 01:30:48,661
peers.
Right,

2114
01:30:48,661 --> 01:30:50,790
right.
Like so he just has come.

2115
01:30:50,820 --> 01:30:51,601
He's like,
he goes,

2116
01:30:51,601 --> 01:30:55,110
I like having comics.
Are comedy writers around and comics the

2117
01:30:55,111 --> 01:30:59,220
way rappers like gold chains,
he's like,

2118
01:30:59,221 --> 01:31:01,780
it just makes me feel good.
He does I to,

2119
01:31:01,900 --> 01:31:06,420
he just likes comics.
I can tell you in his new hour like it's

2120
01:31:06,421 --> 01:31:09,540
not,
I have a two tags,

2121
01:31:10,740 --> 01:31:12,990
another so premises.
There's none of that shit.

2122
01:31:13,020 --> 01:31:16,080
There's like literally I've two tags.
You wouldn't,

2123
01:31:16,081 --> 01:31:18,230
if I hadn't given them,
told them you wouldn't notice.

2124
01:31:18,360 --> 01:31:22,380
But it's also in the interest of making
the overall product better and so he's

2125
01:31:22,381 --> 01:31:25,080
willing to have a bunch of outside eyes
looking.

2126
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:27,810
Yes.
It's putting your material against his

2127
01:31:27,811 --> 01:31:28,561
basically.
It's like,

2128
01:31:28,561 --> 01:31:29,490
okay.
How would you,

2129
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:31,010
what do you have for that job?
No,

2130
01:31:31,020 --> 01:31:33,840
I think I have all the best beans
already.

2131
01:31:34,050 --> 01:31:35,910
Well,
what I was going to say is his work with

2132
01:31:35,911 --> 01:31:38,850
Richard.
Jenny was a agreed yeah,

2133
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:39,890
I did too.
Yeah.

2134
01:31:39,900 --> 01:31:42,720
I think Jenny,
Jenny's the most unheralded I thought

2135
01:31:42,750 --> 01:31:43,300
one of them,

2136
01:31:43,300 --> 01:31:44,950
uh,

2137
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:49,540
what was it?
His second pile of me steaming pile of

2138
01:31:49,541 --> 01:31:53,880
May was great.
And then the one he had some I remember

2139
01:31:54,550 --> 01:31:56,770
out of the subway car.
Oh yeah.

2140
01:31:57,040 --> 01:32:00,340
I was like,
I remember watching like this is fucking

2141
01:32:00,370 --> 01:32:01,810
good.
It's great.

2142
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:03,310
Yeah.
I haven't watched it in 20 years

2143
01:32:03,311 --> 01:32:04,540
probably.
But I remember going like,

2144
01:32:04,660 --> 01:32:06,220
yeah,
this shit is really,

2145
01:32:06,221 --> 01:32:08,380
really good on a steamy pile of me.
I was just,

2146
01:32:08,381 --> 01:32:09,880
uh,
talking to some comics about it the

2147
01:32:09,881 --> 01:32:10,970
other night.
I'm my,

2148
01:32:10,980 --> 01:32:15,310
he has a bit about the difference
between the left and the right in the

2149
01:32:15,311 --> 01:32:17,000
center and you know,
and,

2150
01:32:17,001 --> 01:32:18,070
and,
and I don't want to do,

2151
01:32:18,071 --> 01:32:21,930
I want to paraphrase it,
but it's fucking such a well-written

2152
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:25,330
bit.
And he was so good at squeezing every

2153
01:32:25,331 --> 01:32:28,570
last angle at a bits fucking premise.
Oh,

2154
01:32:28,571 --> 01:32:31,140
just smashed them.
It would just be doing,

2155
01:32:31,160 --> 01:32:35,650
it would be obliterated.
And his economy of words was so magical.

2156
01:32:35,651 --> 01:32:37,450
He was,
he was a craftsman,

2157
01:32:37,780 --> 01:32:40,150
you know,
cause he was really fucking good.

2158
01:32:40,151 --> 01:32:42,370
Again,
a deeply troubled guy who never felt

2159
01:32:42,371 --> 01:32:45,170
like he got the respect that he deserved
and never got debbie.

2160
01:32:45,660 --> 01:32:46,760
Well,
he was in a,

2161
01:32:46,870 --> 01:32:51,190
I think if he was alive today,
he would be this huge Netflix star

2162
01:32:51,340 --> 01:32:54,460
selling out big places and he would
probably be happy with that.

2163
01:32:54,461 --> 01:32:57,330
But in his era,
that wasn't the goal and his era,

2164
01:32:57,350 --> 01:33:01,690
the goal was get a sitcom.
And so he used to do clubs where I would

2165
01:33:01,691 --> 01:33:04,180
go,
I would do the clubs after him and they

2166
01:33:04,181 --> 01:33:05,230
would be saying like,
oh,

2167
01:33:05,231 --> 01:33:06,970
he hates it.
He didn't want to do this.

2168
01:33:06,971 --> 01:33:09,790
He hates doing press.
He's bummed out that he's on the road.

2169
01:33:09,791 --> 01:33:11,950
He didn't move to Hollywood to be on the
road,

2170
01:33:12,430 --> 01:33:14,260
and I was like,
does he understand that he's like one of

2171
01:33:14,261 --> 01:33:16,300
the best comics it's ever lived.
Yeah.

2172
01:33:16,570 --> 01:33:19,870
Like when we were all kids,
when we were starting out back when I

2173
01:33:19,871 --> 01:33:23,560
met you at Boston comedy and like 1991
or whatever it was,

2174
01:33:23,561 --> 01:33:25,060
you weren't even doing standing back
then.

2175
01:33:25,390 --> 01:33:29,380
The goal was to make a living like,
do you think you can make a living?

2176
01:33:29,710 --> 01:33:33,010
You know,
you know what Jenny's only problem was?

2177
01:33:33,550 --> 01:33:38,230
His material was great and I'm trying to
think of a guy who is like this now.

2178
01:33:39,100 --> 01:33:44,100
His material was great.
His presentation was artless,

2179
01:33:45,220 --> 01:33:50,220
meaning he looked like he bought us
suits at fucking at the Dick Tracy

2180
01:33:51,611 --> 01:33:54,640
villain shop.
Like he just looked like he just had a

2181
01:33:54,641 --> 01:33:59,641
hacky sensibility.
His fucking bits were great.

2182
01:33:59,880 --> 01:34:02,500
Right?
There are people that don't like

2183
01:34:02,501 --> 01:34:07,501
Sebastian because of what I'm saying,
cause he's too stylized.

2184
01:34:08,020 --> 01:34:09,490
He's not stopping.
He's,

2185
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:13,660
he looked sebastian shops at the mall.
Do you know what I mean?

2186
01:34:13,661 --> 01:34:15,430
Like to what he's saying,
he's just as my list.

2187
01:34:15,580 --> 01:34:17,530
He's not a,
he's not an artist.

2188
01:34:17,531 --> 01:34:18,850
He's not,
you know what I mean?

2189
01:34:18,851 --> 01:34:20,350
Like he's like,
he,

2190
01:34:20,430 --> 01:34:22,640
he,
I once described,

2191
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:26,560
I once brought Sebastian up as a blue
collar snob

2192
01:34:29,090 --> 01:34:32,590
and which is exactly what he is.
And uh,

2193
01:34:32,830 --> 01:34:35,950
and but like there are people like olive
arguments with people where I'm like,

2194
01:34:35,980 --> 01:34:37,570
Sebastien,
fucking great.

2195
01:34:37,571 --> 01:34:38,920
And they're like,
he doesn't need a little hacky.

2196
01:34:38,930 --> 01:34:40,030
I'm like,
no,

2197
01:34:40,090 --> 01:34:42,010
he's not.
He's not hockey at all.

2198
01:34:42,011 --> 01:34:47,011
But because he dresses like a fucking
Italian of fucking choose from Chicago

2199
01:34:48,390 --> 01:34:52,990
to,
he'd where's vast people literally

2200
01:34:52,991 --> 01:34:55,750
people deduct points.
They don't even know.

2201
01:34:55,780 --> 01:34:57,470
They're not even aware they're doing it.
Yeah.

2202
01:34:57,500 --> 01:34:59,930
And Jenny suffered from that were where
you had to go,

2203
01:35:00,260 --> 01:35:02,510
boy,
this is a fucking good bit.

2204
01:35:02,570 --> 01:35:05,510
Like this is like in terms of writing
wise,

2205
01:35:05,511 --> 01:35:07,850
like he was as good a bit writer is
Hicks was like

2206
01:35:08,350 --> 01:35:11,020
that are way better.
Again,

2207
01:35:11,021 --> 01:35:14,550
he better in terms of humor,
in terms of humor.

2208
01:35:14,551 --> 01:35:18,120
I don't even think they're close,
but I'm saying in terms of his peers at

2209
01:35:18,121 --> 01:35:20,340
the time.
But I mean if you listen to Hicks,

2210
01:35:20,341 --> 01:35:23,670
you're not going to laugh a lot.
Listen to a steaming pile of me.

2211
01:35:23,671 --> 01:35:27,300
You're going to F I was in the car
coming back from the Irvine Improv

2212
01:35:27,301 --> 01:35:31,260
before I filmed my last comedy special.
I was prepping for the comedy special

2213
01:35:31,410 --> 01:35:33,850
and one of the things I like to do,
I like do Irvine's big place,

2214
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:35,670
get everything tight,
give us a full weekend.

2215
01:35:35,671 --> 01:35:37,080
And,
and uh,

2216
01:35:37,110 --> 01:35:40,710
as I was driving home I said,
let me listen to some Richard Jeni and I

2217
01:35:40,711 --> 01:35:44,490
listened to steamy pile,
me and I hadn't heard in years and it

2218
01:35:44,491 --> 01:35:46,470
was from 2007,
I believe.

2219
01:35:46,471 --> 01:35:48,540
And I was fucking crying,
laughing,

2220
01:35:48,810 --> 01:35:51,960
clapping in my car.
I myself on the way home.

2221
01:35:52,020 --> 01:35:54,240
Yeah,
I think he was one of the best ever.

2222
01:35:54,440 --> 01:35:56,850
And I think Hicks is a great comic.
Don't get me wrong.

2223
01:35:56,910 --> 01:35:59,700
I mean he's one of the most influential
and important guys ever.

2224
01:35:59,701 --> 01:36:01,470
But in terms of like humor,
value,

2225
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:02,281
right.
I think Richard,

2226
01:36:02,281 --> 01:36:06,240
Jenny's above you put jenny like closer
to Carlin.

2227
01:36:06,330 --> 01:36:07,060
Yes.
Yeah.

2228
01:36:07,060 --> 01:36:08,370
Yes.
I put it again,

2229
01:36:08,371 --> 01:36:09,900
Carlin.
Wow.

2230
01:36:09,930 --> 01:36:10,860
That's to me.

2231
01:36:10,930 --> 01:36:11,760
Yeah,
that's fine.

2232
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:14,500
In terms of like,
I kind of think rock might to rock

2233
01:36:14,501 --> 01:36:15,900
fucking adored Jenny.

2234
01:36:16,980 --> 01:36:19,410
Uh,
the

2235
01:36:20,500 --> 01:36:24,250
you but people deduct points cause it
seems like because he worked,

2236
01:36:24,290 --> 01:36:26,590
because he had her within his voice,
like,

2237
01:36:26,780 --> 01:36:30,530
and Carlin would wear fucking a tee
shirt and like down,

2238
01:36:30,531 --> 01:36:33,770
like I'm a workman artist.
Whereas like Jenny was like,

2239
01:36:33,771 --> 01:36:35,750
are you,
what are you going for the dentist?

2240
01:36:35,780 --> 01:36:37,950
Yeah.
Like duty.

2241
01:36:38,300 --> 01:36:39,680
Yeah.
And like his,

2242
01:36:39,770 --> 01:36:42,230
his,
and he's like a foreign needs like Tan

2243
01:36:42,231 --> 01:36:45,200
and he's got his Harris come back and
it's like he had a lot of plastic

2244
01:36:45,201 --> 01:36:47,540
surgery too.
He kind of went a little bit nutty and

2245
01:36:47,541 --> 01:36:49,790
tried to become a leading man.
And yeah,

2246
01:36:49,880 --> 01:36:53,540
he had a lot of issues,
but the comedy was fucking genius,

2247
01:36:53,541 --> 01:36:54,374
man.
Yeah.

2248
01:36:54,470 --> 01:36:57,680
But people do judge like people the way
they look,

2249
01:36:57,710 --> 01:36:59,660
you know,
like it's,

2250
01:36:59,990 --> 01:37:01,370
it's a weird thing,
you know,

2251
01:37:01,371 --> 01:37:04,400
like Whitney and her last special HBO
special,

2252
01:37:04,401 --> 01:37:07,280
she wore hair down and she said that was
like a big issue.

2253
01:37:08,120 --> 01:37:10,540
Always wears her hair up.
She like,

2254
01:37:10,750 --> 01:37:13,760
and if they wanted to wear,
and Chris wanted her to wear her hair

2255
01:37:13,761 --> 01:37:15,550
down and she's like,
ah,

2256
01:37:15,560 --> 01:37:16,910
I just put it on it.
And I was like,

2257
01:37:16,911 --> 01:37:20,090
you should wear your hair up.
And she do you wear your hair up?

2258
01:37:20,180 --> 01:37:20,990
Well,
Tom,

2259
01:37:20,990 --> 01:37:23,450
argument rock was saying he wanted her
hair down.

2260
01:37:23,570 --> 01:37:24,321
He at,
by the way,

2261
01:37:24,321 --> 01:37:26,150
rock didn't say it.
He'd practice,

2262
01:37:26,151 --> 01:37:27,960
said it to someone at Hbo like,
Oh,

2263
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:29,720
she could wear her hair down.
He wasn't lying.

2264
01:37:29,930 --> 01:37:33,590
I demand hello,
this is Chris Rock.

2265
01:37:34,370 --> 01:37:35,203
He was like,
just,

2266
01:37:35,330 --> 01:37:37,280
she's wearing hair down.
Uh,

2267
01:37:37,550 --> 01:37:40,220
his thing was,
uh,

2268
01:37:40,310 --> 01:37:45,310
she reads too hard on camera with her
hair pulled back.

2269
01:37:45,740 --> 01:37:48,920
It's all,
and her delivery is so like,

2270
01:37:49,380 --> 01:37:50,213
Gotcha.

2271
01:37:51,210 --> 01:37:53,400
The menacing is the wrong word,
but like,

2272
01:37:53,401 --> 01:37:56,400
it's,
it's like very forceful.

2273
01:37:56,450 --> 01:37:58,590
Kibbeh see that's what I like.
Right.

2274
01:37:58,740 --> 01:38:01,320
I liked the fact that she's like,
I'm pulling my fucking hair up.

2275
01:38:01,590 --> 01:38:03,510
No nonsense.
Yeah,

2276
01:38:03,930 --> 01:38:04,763
no bullshit.

2277
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:07,410
It was seeing it more from a,
uh,

2278
01:38:07,770 --> 01:38:09,990
just a point of view of like a stent.
A director.

2279
01:38:09,991 --> 01:38:10,301
Yeah.
Yeah.

2280
01:38:10,301 --> 01:38:11,070
Just like,

2281
01:38:11,070 --> 01:38:12,600
cause dude,
it matters.

2282
01:38:12,870 --> 01:38:15,720
It does matter.
It matters more than you think,

2283
01:38:15,750 --> 01:38:18,120
but it matters more I think for the
person delivering it.

2284
01:38:18,121 --> 01:38:21,120
They feel comfortable and I think
because she's a beautiful woman,

2285
01:38:21,330 --> 01:38:23,820
I think for her pulling their hair out
because like,

2286
01:38:23,821 --> 01:38:27,360
I'm not accentuating that at all.
I just want you to listen to what I have

2287
01:38:27,361 --> 01:38:28,110
to say.
Yeah.

2288
01:38:28,110 --> 01:38:30,000
And that's the best way to do it.
You know,

2289
01:38:30,001 --> 01:38:32,040
like there's parallels.
I mean like,

2290
01:38:32,070 --> 01:38:37,070
like if you saw a really funny woman,
but she was dressing like a prime time,

2291
01:38:38,401 --> 01:38:42,240
Megan Kelly on Fox with little tiny
skirts on or boob showing,

2292
01:38:42,330 --> 01:38:43,163
it's like,
yeah,

2293
01:38:43,470 --> 01:38:45,960
what are you selling?
Like you're selling something different

2294
01:38:45,961 --> 01:38:47,280
than just,
I'm a standup comic.

2295
01:38:47,310 --> 01:38:48,330
Like you're,
you're selling,

2296
01:38:48,331 --> 01:38:50,880
I'm,
I'm a sexy lady out for a night on the

2297
01:38:50,881 --> 01:38:52,710
town,
but I'm also going to tell you some

2298
01:38:52,711 --> 01:38:54,570
jokes.
Gas Message.

2299
01:38:54,610 --> 01:38:55,443
Yeah.

2300
01:38:56,790 --> 01:39:00,090
But the,
the thing that people don't take into

2301
01:39:00,091 --> 01:39:01,890
account sometimes it's like,
you know,

2302
01:39:01,891 --> 01:39:06,810
a lot of the successful male comics are
good looking posh is fucking good luck.

2303
01:39:06,811 --> 01:39:09,330
He's a handsome fella,
but weird gay tones.

2304
01:39:09,331 --> 01:39:10,164
Right?
Fine.

2305
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,160
Fine.
That's a small price to pay for those

2306
01:39:14,161 --> 01:39:16,920
looks.
You get a fucking face.

2307
01:39:17,160 --> 01:39:18,780
I love Taj.
But the reason why I said that was like

2308
01:39:19,140 --> 01:39:21,510
Doug,
Stan hope who's a fucking maniac wrote

2309
01:39:21,511 --> 01:39:25,410
something crazy about tosh in his book.
Just you can just fucking with him.

2310
01:39:25,411 --> 01:39:28,480
I forget it was the murders women who
uh,

2311
01:39:28,730 --> 01:39:32,250
that's funny.
Question is sexuality like Stan hope

2312
01:39:32,251 --> 01:39:34,680
went semi hunters Thompson and some of
his stuff.

2313
01:39:34,850 --> 01:39:35,790
That's correct.
Clearly,

2314
01:39:35,791 --> 01:39:38,490
obviously he's making things up.
You have to be,

2315
01:39:38,491 --> 01:39:40,530
it's you have to be obviously wear,
but yeah,

2316
01:39:40,531 --> 01:39:43,800
Tasha is obviously a good looking guy.
Sebastian a beautiful man.

2317
01:39:44,020 --> 01:39:46,370
Um,
Dave,

2318
01:39:46,720 --> 01:39:49,190
Dave Chapelle.
Chapelle.

2319
01:39:49,191 --> 01:39:50,020
Yes.
Yeah.

2320
01:39:50,020 --> 01:39:52,240
He,
I think he was better looking skinny.

2321
01:39:52,390 --> 01:39:53,230
Really?
Yeah.

2322
01:39:53,440 --> 01:39:56,740
Personally it was more my speech.
Got Some fucking guns now.

2323
01:39:56,800 --> 01:39:58,030
Yeah.
Um,

2324
01:39:58,330 --> 01:40:01,510
like there's not like,
cause he was good looking prior look

2325
01:40:01,511 --> 01:40:06,250
like something like nothing I think
looks Maine like mean more than people

2326
01:40:06,320 --> 01:40:07,960
take into account.
It's like I always say to people,

2327
01:40:08,290 --> 01:40:11,710
no one with gray hair has ever made it
as a comic.

2328
01:40:11,800 --> 01:40:14,650
Not Never,
but almost never

2329
01:40:16,380 --> 01:40:19,850
think about it.
Steve Martin and Rodney are my list.

2330
01:40:20,680 --> 01:40:22,040
Hm.
Rodney was a cartoon.

2331
01:40:22,041 --> 01:40:24,020
Old Man.
I think there's something about being

2332
01:40:24,021 --> 01:40:24,950
old though.
You lose,

2333
01:40:24,980 --> 01:40:29,510
you'll lose your exuberance and your
enthusiasm and then the people are,

2334
01:40:29,870 --> 01:40:32,090
you know,
that's a part of the aging process.

2335
01:40:32,230 --> 01:40:35,240
And it depends on how much you cultivate
your own personal energy.

2336
01:40:35,420 --> 01:40:36,830
Yeah.
How much are you paying attention to

2337
01:40:36,831 --> 01:40:38,510
that or how well you taking care of your
body?

2338
01:40:38,740 --> 01:40:41,020
You know,
like more impressed

2339
01:40:41,110 --> 01:40:44,800
if you can come to these conclusions in
26 years.

2340
01:40:45,060 --> 01:40:45,960
Yeah.
But you can't,

2341
01:40:48,690 --> 01:40:52,200
well you people in essence,
yeah.

2342
01:40:52,500 --> 01:40:56,410
Yeah.
But like drawn white is a gray haired

2343
01:40:56,411 --> 01:40:58,240
guy now.
It means that the newest cities

2344
01:40:58,320 --> 01:41:01,490
spin and he's like a cartoon alcoholic.
Yeah.

2345
01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:03,080
Yeah.
And a real alcoholic.

2346
01:41:03,110 --> 01:41:04,130
Yeah.
He's the jet.

2347
01:41:04,190 --> 01:41:06,260
And the funny shit,
that motherfucker,

2348
01:41:06,290 --> 01:41:09,860
that motherfucker is so funny.
I said to him,

2349
01:41:10,030 --> 01:41:11,150
uh,
I was like,

2350
01:41:11,151 --> 01:41:12,920
Hey,
he did a joke.

2351
01:41:13,790 --> 01:41:15,560
He did a joke that like,
and I go,

2352
01:41:15,561 --> 01:41:17,780
d remembered that joke.
Where are you talking about?

2353
01:41:17,781 --> 01:41:21,500
You're in a,
in a fight with your wife and you said

2354
01:41:21,501 --> 01:41:22,334
some.
And he goes like,

2355
01:41:22,760 --> 01:41:24,650
I don't remember.
And it's like,

2356
01:41:24,651 --> 01:41:25,460
you don't remember.

2357
01:41:25,460 --> 01:41:28,220
That's a fucking,
you don't remember.

2358
01:41:31,430 --> 01:41:34,640
He was telling us a story in the back
room of the comedy store.

2359
01:41:35,060 --> 01:41:36,100
Uh,
you know the back bar?

2360
01:41:36,110 --> 01:41:37,910
Yeah.
He was telling us a story and I'm

2361
01:41:37,911 --> 01:41:38,780
fucking literally,

2362
01:41:39,770 --> 01:41:43,320
by the way it will heat.
I'd seen him do it six weeks earlier and

2363
01:41:43,321 --> 01:41:44,160
he was like,
I don't remember.

2364
01:41:44,930 --> 01:41:47,890
I was,
he was telling a story and I was crying

2365
01:41:47,891 --> 01:41:51,010
like tears rolling down my face and I
forget who else was with us.

2366
01:41:51,220 --> 01:41:52,810
And I go,
you got to tell that on stage.

2367
01:41:52,811 --> 01:41:53,230
He goes,
yeah,

2368
01:41:53,230 --> 01:41:56,500
thank [inaudible] please tell that story
on stage please.

2369
01:41:57,130 --> 01:41:58,240
And he goes,
man,

2370
01:41:58,241 --> 01:41:59,074
I dunno.
I go,

2371
01:41:59,080 --> 01:42:00,910
just fucking tell it.
It's going to kill.

2372
01:42:01,150 --> 01:42:03,730
He went on stage with it that night.
He's like,

2373
01:42:03,731 --> 01:42:06,610
got a bottle of Tequila,
he pours himself out of the drink,

2374
01:42:06,611 --> 01:42:10,690
literally goes from the back bar to the
stage and closes with that.

2375
01:42:10,830 --> 01:42:13,390
Yeah.
Closes with it and it smashes.

2376
01:42:13,490 --> 01:42:14,170
Yeah.

2377
01:42:14,170 --> 01:42:16,160
Part,
I think I may have seen a bit of it,

2378
01:42:16,190 --> 01:42:16,881
Jeff,
by the way.

2379
01:42:16,881 --> 01:42:20,070
Jeffrey's Jim went on,
he'd decent.

2380
01:42:20,120 --> 01:42:21,020
Jim's not badly.
I mean,

2381
01:42:21,021 --> 01:42:22,310
it's like whatever,
it's a good looking guy.

2382
01:42:22,311 --> 01:42:23,420
Yeah.
Um,

2383
01:42:24,170 --> 01:42:26,930
uh,
Jeffrey's went on the other night,

2384
01:42:26,960 --> 01:42:29,420
like he was drunk,
he'd been drinking all day and his

2385
01:42:29,421 --> 01:42:32,000
friend was like,
can you do standup drunk?

2386
01:42:32,001 --> 01:42:33,200
And he's like,
yeah.

2387
01:42:33,201 --> 01:42:33,651
And he's like,
well,

2388
01:42:33,651 --> 01:42:37,010
I don't believe whatever.
And like Jeffrey's went on and fucking

2389
01:42:37,011 --> 01:42:39,650
murder for half an hour,
just like drunk.

2390
01:42:40,520 --> 01:42:42,380
It can be done.
God bless you.

2391
01:42:42,620 --> 01:42:43,041
Yeah.
I mean,

2392
01:42:43,041 --> 01:42:44,990
especially if you're feeling it.
Yeah.

2393
01:42:45,060 --> 01:42:46,050
You know,
I feel like you,

2394
01:42:46,051 --> 01:42:51,051
you like sometimes being drunk,
like as long as the momentum's in the

2395
01:42:51,161 --> 01:42:52,480
right way,
you know,

2396
01:42:52,481 --> 01:42:55,830
like you're thinking in a good way and
everything comes out in your other set

2397
01:42:55,840 --> 01:42:58,140
of Jack got some fucking shit to talk
about.

2398
01:42:58,540 --> 01:42:59,211
Yeah.
Hey,

2399
01:42:59,211 --> 01:43:00,044
we go.
Yeah.

2400
01:43:00,160 --> 01:43:01,610
And then he goes into his act.
Yeah.

2401
01:43:01,750 --> 01:43:03,670
You don't really do drink much.
A little bit.

2402
01:43:03,700 --> 01:43:05,710
Yeah.
No,

2403
01:43:05,711 --> 01:43:06,880
not before go on stage.
Very,

2404
01:43:06,881 --> 01:43:08,770
very rarely I have,
it's not good.

2405
01:43:08,840 --> 01:43:09,970
Right.
I like a drink.

2406
01:43:10,300 --> 01:43:12,190
Maybe two drinks,
you know,

2407
01:43:12,240 --> 01:43:13,720
it would get a little tipsy.
Yeah.

2408
01:43:14,080 --> 01:43:17,500
But um,
being drunk on stage,

2409
01:43:17,530 --> 01:43:20,470
it's like not,
it's not the right way to manage the

2410
01:43:20,471 --> 01:43:24,040
ideas,
but it is a good way to not give a fuck.

2411
01:43:24,280 --> 01:43:27,420
So like if you have an idea and you feel
so strongly about it and you,

2412
01:43:27,430 --> 01:43:31,210
you're,
I mean obviously so varies depending

2413
01:43:31,211 --> 01:43:34,390
upon where you are in your life and
where you are with the material.

2414
01:43:34,391 --> 01:43:38,200
But sometimes some material just needs a
little bit of,

2415
01:43:38,201 --> 01:43:39,330
I don't give a fuck.
Yeah.

2416
01:43:39,910 --> 01:43:41,680
You know,
and then if you have a couple of drinks

2417
01:43:41,681 --> 01:43:43,540
for,
you talk about that subject and you're

2418
01:43:43,541 --> 01:43:43,781
like,
well,

2419
01:43:43,781 --> 01:43:46,690
why the fuck do I have to pay attention
at us?

2420
01:43:47,020 --> 01:43:50,890
And then you'd gets in a new place.
It's truly like jogs the,

2421
01:43:51,260 --> 01:43:52,110
where it's like,
here's

2422
01:43:52,110 --> 01:43:55,700
the fucking wall they hit this wall is a
door and you're like,

2423
01:43:55,701 --> 01:43:56,640
oh fuck.
All right.

2424
01:43:57,470 --> 01:44:01,220
Talking some real shit.
Why I'm a big believer in using as many

2425
01:44:01,221 --> 01:44:04,130
different methods as possible to explore
ideas,

2426
01:44:04,131 --> 01:44:08,780
whether it's the sensory deprivation
tank or pod or psychedelics or booze or,

2427
01:44:09,260 --> 01:44:13,520
or just going places and doing things.
And I think as I've gotten older and I

2428
01:44:13,610 --> 01:44:17,540
am on a schedule to put out a special
every year and a half or so,

2429
01:44:18,350 --> 01:44:20,260
two years now,
I think it's like,

2430
01:44:20,450 --> 01:44:23,510
my last one was in October,
so my last one was a year and a couple

2431
01:44:23,510 --> 01:44:27,050
of months and I'm getting ready to film
it in April.

2432
01:44:27,051 --> 01:44:28,950
So it'll be about a year and a half.
That's a,

2433
01:44:28,951 --> 01:44:30,970
to me,
he's like a good schedule came out in

2434
01:44:31,060 --> 01:44:33,350
October or you shut it,
came out in October,

2435
01:44:33,351 --> 01:44:37,460
shot it in June.
So from shoot to shoot it's about two

2436
01:44:37,461 --> 01:44:38,270
years.

2437
01:44:38,270 --> 01:44:41,210
Um,
I feel like that is,

2438
01:44:41,300 --> 01:44:45,440
if to do that I have to do things.
You have to have to have experiences.

2439
01:44:45,441 --> 01:44:47,360
I have to,
I have to force,

2440
01:44:47,450 --> 01:44:51,470
I have to not force myself to,
but I have to be consciously aware of

2441
01:44:51,471 --> 01:44:52,850
being an action.
Yeah.

2442
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:54,100
Things have to happen.
Yeah.

2443
01:44:54,101 --> 01:44:59,101
And like I'm going to Vancouver next
week to do the Boga.

2444
01:45:00,290 --> 01:45:01,610
Oh Shit.
Uh,

2445
01:45:01,670 --> 01:45:06,670
and then the weekend for that I'm going
to Bangkok is ibogaine illegal in

2446
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:09,160
Vancouver.
It is beautiful.

2447
01:45:09,161 --> 01:45:10,500
It should be everywhere.
Yeah.

2448
01:45:10,790 --> 01:45:14,210
It's not something that kills people.
So it's supposed to be amazing for

2449
01:45:14,211 --> 01:45:15,620
curing addictions.
Yeah.

2450
01:45:15,670 --> 01:45:17,540
That's,
I'm just going to see what it does for

2451
01:45:17,541 --> 01:45:19,250
depression because it's gotten way
better,

2452
01:45:19,251 --> 01:45:21,140
like in the last year.
Uh,

2453
01:45:21,270 --> 01:45:22,580
it,
the depression has gotten better.

2454
01:45:22,581 --> 01:45:27,260
And uh,
which again is the weird thing from,

2455
01:45:28,010 --> 01:45:32,540
I hate to say that having a successful
special cured my depression,

2456
01:45:33,470 --> 01:45:35,540
but you hate,
I don't want it to be that linear,

2457
01:45:35,541 --> 01:45:39,620
but it made me,
it just got me out of fucking negative

2458
01:45:39,621 --> 01:45:40,100
thinking.

2459
01:45:40,100 --> 01:45:41,750
Isn't that funny?
But I don't,

2460
01:45:41,780 --> 01:45:44,870
I don't think there's anything wrong
with you saying that because I think

2461
01:45:45,230 --> 01:45:47,570
there's a real stigma between
correlating,

2462
01:45:47,630 --> 01:45:51,380
having a success and achievement and
being happy.

2463
01:45:51,400 --> 01:45:53,560
Yeah.
But Ari Shaffir is a great example of

2464
01:45:53,561 --> 01:45:56,600
that I think are,
there was a chemical issue too.

2465
01:45:56,630 --> 01:46:00,190
You know,
Ari was on Propecia for awhile and I'm

2466
01:46:00,950 --> 01:46:02,330
holding on.
Yeah.

2467
01:46:02,360 --> 01:46:02,960
Well he,
he,

2468
01:46:02,960 --> 01:46:04,580
he let go.
He got off of it.

2469
01:46:04,910 --> 01:46:08,630
But one of the side effects of Propecia
is pretty severe depression.

2470
01:46:08,631 --> 01:46:09,570
Yeah.
Um,

2471
01:46:09,660 --> 01:46:11,660
our,
he got on some psych meds,

2472
01:46:11,661 --> 01:46:16,430
he got on some antidepressants,
then his career took off and he weaned

2473
01:46:16,431 --> 01:46:20,540
himself off the antidepressants and he
doesn't need them anymore.

2474
01:46:20,600 --> 01:46:22,310
Maybe they,
ours one of the happiest guys I know.

2475
01:46:22,340 --> 01:46:24,980
Yeah.
But he's also very successful.

2476
01:46:25,010 --> 01:46:26,570
Yeah.
And that's,

2477
01:46:27,250 --> 01:46:29,760
you know,
last five years of his life,

2478
01:46:29,761 --> 01:46:31,110
like money,
you know,

2479
01:46:31,160 --> 01:46:33,850
money can't buy you happiness.
Uh,

2480
01:46:33,950 --> 01:46:35,270
the,
it's true.

2481
01:46:36,620 --> 01:46:40,460
Validation isn't nothing.
It's not nothing.

2482
01:46:40,760 --> 01:46:42,470
It's like,
it's,

2483
01:46:42,530 --> 01:46:45,830
you know,
it's steam and the look in people's eyes

2484
01:46:45,890 --> 01:46:48,220
and the energies people have ps.
That's what I'm doing.

2485
01:46:48,221 --> 01:46:49,950
Like the look of like,
Oh,

2486
01:46:50,390 --> 01:46:51,240
you're,
yeah.

2487
01:46:51,390 --> 01:46:53,490
I can't,
like you're,

2488
01:46:54,030 --> 01:46:55,800
you're,
you're legit.

2489
01:46:55,940 --> 01:46:57,530
You and I,
when I,

2490
01:46:57,531 --> 01:47:01,850
if I run into you,
if we're passing in the hallway and you

2491
01:47:01,851 --> 01:47:02,421
know,
you say,

2492
01:47:02,421 --> 01:47:03,870
I love that bed that you're doing.
Like,

2493
01:47:04,160 --> 01:47:05,600
ah,
like I'm like,

2494
01:47:05,780 --> 01:47:07,480
I know you're really funny guy.
Yeah.

2495
01:47:07,580 --> 01:47:09,440
You like my thing.
I get happy.

2496
01:47:09,441 --> 01:47:11,660
You telling me that Chris Rock said I'm
a great comic line.

2497
01:47:11,661 --> 01:47:12,920
Yeah.
I get happy.

2498
01:47:12,950 --> 01:47:14,480
Yeah.
Positive affirmation.

2499
01:47:14,481 --> 01:47:15,440
It's real.
And it's like,

2500
01:47:15,441 --> 01:47:17,930
as much as I like,
I'm not insecure.

2501
01:47:17,931 --> 01:47:18,741
In fact,
like I,

2502
01:47:18,741 --> 01:47:20,750
I'm like,
w go up tonight.

2503
01:47:20,751 --> 01:47:22,340
Am I worried?
Do I know how to do this?

2504
01:47:22,341 --> 01:47:23,060
No.
No.

2505
01:47:23,060 --> 01:47:27,440
But you tell me someone who's really
good says I'm good.

2506
01:47:28,160 --> 01:47:29,570
It feels good.
You,

2507
01:47:29,790 --> 01:47:33,120
you feel like you're in.
And that's what so many of us felt like

2508
01:47:33,121 --> 01:47:36,090
we weren't before we became,
by the way,

2509
01:47:37,120 --> 01:47:40,210
I like to say that goes away.
Um,

2510
01:47:40,930 --> 01:47:43,120
uh,
Ellen Degeneres is,

2511
01:47:43,121 --> 01:47:46,360
uh,
I shot this netflix commercial with her

2512
01:47:46,361 --> 01:47:47,850
and Chris and Seinfeld and,
uh,

2513
01:47:47,890 --> 01:47:48,910
Dave and,
um,

2514
01:47:50,080 --> 01:47:52,030
and uh,
so we,

2515
01:47:52,090 --> 01:47:57,090
me and eleanor like buddies now and
she's doing a new hour and she sent me

2516
01:47:58,061 --> 01:48:03,061
15 minutes of it on DVD.
It like she doesn't fuck with computers.

2517
01:48:03,161 --> 01:48:04,540
She doesn't email in,
which is like smart.

2518
01:48:05,530 --> 01:48:06,221
She,
I mean,

2519
01:48:06,221 --> 01:48:08,170
not like shut the fuck.
She's like,

2520
01:48:08,171 --> 01:48:09,350
she just doesn't it.
Yeah.

2521
01:48:09,470 --> 01:48:10,680
Yeah.
Um,

2522
01:48:11,050 --> 01:48:13,210
she doesn't like,
she'll text on her phone,

2523
01:48:13,211 --> 01:48:14,590
she'll,
she'll answer and whatever.

2524
01:48:15,070 --> 01:48:15,820
But,
um,

2525
01:48:15,820 --> 01:48:20,820
she sent me the f her 15 minutes on a
DVD and I watched it at like midnight on

2526
01:48:21,401 --> 01:48:26,290
a Thursday and didn't text her,
cause I don't know when she goes to

2527
01:48:26,291 --> 01:48:29,740
sleep and I woke up to a text from her
going like,

2528
01:48:29,770 --> 01:48:30,760
Hey,
did you watch it

2529
01:48:31,730 --> 01:48:32,740
right?
And I was like,

2530
01:48:33,080 --> 01:48:34,100
yeah.
She's like,

2531
01:48:34,101 --> 01:48:35,720
I'm starting to get at a,
she's like,

2532
01:48:35,900 --> 01:48:36,920
and I go,
yes.

2533
01:48:37,010 --> 01:48:37,843
I was like,
Ellen,

2534
01:48:37,850 --> 01:48:40,010
you're fucking hilarious.
And she wrote like,

2535
01:48:40,160 --> 01:48:40,993
phew,

2536
01:48:43,990 --> 01:48:46,510
it never ends.
Never ends,

2537
01:48:46,511 --> 01:48:49,540
never ends.
It can't end if it ends,

2538
01:48:49,541 --> 01:48:51,670
you know,
it's like I've talked about this before,

2539
01:48:51,671 --> 01:48:55,750
that that dream of retirement,
that sailing off into the sunset is

2540
01:48:55,751 --> 01:48:58,050
straight on the horse.
It's horse shit.

2541
01:48:58,130 --> 01:49:00,880
Yeah.
You want to do good stuff and the only

2542
01:49:00,881 --> 01:49:04,090
way to do good stuff is to worry whether
or not you're doing good stuff.

2543
01:49:04,900 --> 01:49:07,120
Yeah.
That's the main,

2544
01:49:07,240 --> 01:49:08,380
or I,
again,

2545
01:49:08,381 --> 01:49:13,381
I'm trying to balance the desire to do
good stuff and not,

2546
01:49:14,590 --> 01:49:16,540
and having a good life.
You know what I mean?

2547
01:49:16,570 --> 01:49:18,060
You have to have balls because that's
the,

2548
01:49:18,061 --> 01:49:19,900
the,
the other thing that happened was like

2549
01:49:19,901 --> 01:49:22,570
when like when Charlie Murphy died this
year,

2550
01:49:22,571 --> 01:49:27,310
I was like [inaudible] fucking that's
like that was it.

2551
01:49:27,360 --> 01:49:28,790
Yeah.
That's that.

2552
01:49:28,850 --> 01:49:32,470
That's it.
That's the end of him.

2553
01:49:33,220 --> 01:49:38,110
And like I want all I could think of was
did he have fun?

2554
01:49:38,340 --> 01:49:39,430
Right.
You know what I mean?

2555
01:49:39,610 --> 01:49:42,160
Like did he have fun?
Cause that's really the only thing that

2556
01:49:42,161 --> 01:49:43,270
matters.
All this stuff of like,

2557
01:49:44,440 --> 01:49:47,630
even the best known comic isn't,

2558
01:49:48,760 --> 01:49:51,190
I mean you're like,
people don't think about Carlin that

2559
01:49:51,191 --> 01:49:52,660
much anymore.
Do you know what I mean?

2560
01:49:53,080 --> 01:49:55,240
Like he matter,
it doesn't

2561
01:49:55,710 --> 01:49:58,320
in matters to the people that you affect
in a positive way,

2562
01:49:58,321 --> 01:50:02,500
but ultimately for you,
you live and then you die and are,

2563
01:50:02,690 --> 01:50:05,520
are you enjoying being alive and those
uncomfortable things,

2564
01:50:05,521 --> 01:50:08,250
do they help you like the uncomfortable
things about Ellen,

2565
01:50:08,280 --> 01:50:10,260
like view,
what that's going to do is going to

2566
01:50:10,261 --> 01:50:14,790
allow her through that weird sort of
anxiety and insecurity.

2567
01:50:14,970 --> 01:50:16,730
It's going to allow her to make an
amazing special.

2568
01:50:16,731 --> 01:50:18,390
Yeah.
And the same thing can be said of us.

2569
01:50:18,540 --> 01:50:19,440
My,
I'm one,

2570
01:50:19,441 --> 01:50:22,740
I'm going to film in April.
I'm fucking terrified of writing a new

2571
01:50:22,741 --> 01:50:27,120
act cause this act,
when I first started it a year ago,

2572
01:50:27,150 --> 01:50:31,860
it was like on Bambi legs and it was dog
shit and I would do it at the store and

2573
01:50:31,861 --> 01:50:35,760
I would have bits that would just be
clunky and they'd come out awkward and

2574
01:50:35,761 --> 01:50:38,430
then they started to take life after a
month or so and then they started to

2575
01:50:38,431 --> 01:50:41,190
grow and bill till it was something that
I could take on the road.

2576
01:50:41,340 --> 01:50:43,140
And now that I've gone through that
whole process,

2577
01:50:43,380 --> 01:50:45,660
the idea of tossing them aside and
starting all over again,

2578
01:50:45,661 --> 01:50:46,630
it's like,
yes,

2579
01:50:46,720 --> 01:50:49,620
this is terrifying.
But that's the only way you get better.

2580
01:50:49,650 --> 01:50:50,130
Yeah.
Yeah.

2581
01:50:50,130 --> 01:50:53,880
By the way,
Ellen did like a half hour at Largo and

2582
01:50:53,881 --> 01:50:58,230
then she didn't half hour of a q and a.
And when I say this motherfucker

2583
01:50:58,290 --> 01:51:03,290
murdered this month,
I mean it was like God damn,

2584
01:51:03,450 --> 01:51:05,190
like sh like,
oh,

2585
01:51:05,191 --> 01:51:08,940
that's the funniest thing she could have
said followed by that being the funniest

2586
01:51:08,941 --> 01:51:11,490
thing.
She like literally like in a fucking,

2587
01:51:11,670 --> 01:51:13,980
they was like watching someone in a
fight just like,

2588
01:51:14,210 --> 01:51:15,043
ah,
ah,

2589
01:51:15,240 --> 01:51:19,200
ah,
like q and a and fucking murder and the

2590
01:51:19,201 --> 01:51:21,280
people yelling things out though.
It was just like,

2591
01:51:21,350 --> 01:51:22,440
Ellen,
I have an agenda.

2592
01:51:22,441 --> 01:51:23,730
And she's,
she was funny.

2593
01:51:23,731 --> 01:51:28,731
She was mean
because she doesn't fucking comic.

2594
01:51:29,791 --> 01:51:31,290
She's like,
you know what I mean?

2595
01:51:31,300 --> 01:51:33,930
Like she can write,
you don't write jokes from kindness

2596
01:51:34,920 --> 01:51:37,560
stokes from agitation and have to tell
people that.

2597
01:51:37,980 --> 01:51:39,310
Yeah.
Uh,

2598
01:51:39,390 --> 01:51:42,480
but she's like,
she like even people that worked on her

2599
01:51:42,960 --> 01:51:46,110
on her talks over like Jesus that was
like magic,

2600
01:51:47,100 --> 01:51:51,690
just like God damn grade talk shows
sensor,

2601
01:51:51,710 --> 01:51:53,670
you know,
give her an option to just do something

2602
01:51:53,671 --> 01:51:54,330
like that.

2603
01:51:54,330 --> 01:51:55,650
Yeah.
You're going to see what she's really

2604
01:51:55,651 --> 01:51:59,640
capable of and she's capable of being
very charming and fun.

2605
01:52:00,340 --> 01:52:02,730
Super true.
Like that's what the show mostly is

2606
01:52:02,750 --> 01:52:06,170
like.
It's mostly just like doing it ge,

2607
01:52:06,180 --> 01:52:08,150
she's just sweet.
Yeah.

2608
01:52:08,220 --> 01:52:09,900
And then it's a comic.
She's not,

2609
01:52:10,140 --> 01:52:12,660
it's not just sweet.
He can't be,

2610
01:52:12,690 --> 01:52:14,160
it can't be,
it's literally your,

2611
01:52:14,250 --> 01:52:16,290
you can't do comedy.
It's just I do that.

2612
01:52:16,320 --> 01:52:17,820
I do that.
Stand up on the spot show.

2613
01:52:17,821 --> 01:52:19,950
You've done that before.
I did it Tuesday night.

2614
01:52:20,580 --> 01:52:22,140
I said something to someone I could
look,

2615
01:52:22,530 --> 01:52:24,360
I go,
I'm going to be mean.

2616
01:52:24,430 --> 01:52:26,100
I could understand that.
I don't mean this,

2617
01:52:26,130 --> 01:52:28,500
but when you say something stupid I have
to attack you.

2618
01:52:28,950 --> 01:52:31,590
You have to be sacrificed for the
greater good of the show.

2619
01:52:31,940 --> 01:52:33,840
As long as you're cool with that.
Yeah.

2620
01:52:34,080 --> 01:52:35,480
I'm sorry.
That's just the way it,

2621
01:52:35,510 --> 01:52:38,400
and it's not like she's not like a dark
hearted person or whatever and it's like

2622
01:52:38,790 --> 01:52:40,600
that's just kind of,
yeah.

2623
01:52:40,650 --> 01:52:42,040
Who,
and she,

2624
01:52:42,060 --> 01:52:42,980
you know,
she,

2625
01:52:43,020 --> 01:52:46,280
we all have this fear of like,
can I do it again?

2626
01:52:46,610 --> 01:52:48,980
It's jumping.
You're jumping over your do your evil

2627
01:52:48,981 --> 01:52:50,060
knievel.
Yeah.

2628
01:52:50,270 --> 01:52:53,540
And it's like you,
there really is like a fear of like,

2629
01:52:53,541 --> 01:52:56,870
can I clear the,
can I clear the chasm?

2630
01:52:57,110 --> 01:53:00,170
And you are literally only as good as
your last set.

2631
01:53:00,650 --> 01:53:02,830
Yeah.
If you bomb like you better get up on

2632
01:53:02,831 --> 01:53:04,750
stage quick and fix it.
Hurt Shit

2633
01:53:04,750 --> 01:53:08,990
stands for 20 hours to get back up there
and fix that.

2634
01:53:09,090 --> 01:53:11,490
Yeah,
side effects may you literally

2635
01:53:11,580 --> 01:53:15,810
will sting for that shit doesn't and I
don't think it gets better,

2636
01:53:16,200 --> 01:53:18,240
doesn't get better.
It gets worse because then the people

2637
01:53:18,241 --> 01:53:19,950
come to see you.
They expect more of you.

2638
01:53:19,951 --> 01:53:22,740
You have higher expectations.
You should know better.

2639
01:53:23,220 --> 01:53:24,080
You should know,
but I know about it.

2640
01:53:24,260 --> 01:53:25,980
The bomb,
what the hell is your problem?

2641
01:53:26,010 --> 01:53:29,160
How you bombing still?
But the thing is,

2642
01:53:29,161 --> 01:53:30,270
man,
that develop

2643
01:53:30,310 --> 01:53:32,570
mine of material must be done in front
of an audience.

2644
01:53:32,571 --> 01:53:35,720
I mean I've write on a computer and on a
notebook,

2645
01:53:35,721 --> 01:53:39,110
but the only way it really works out is
in front of a crowd.

2646
01:53:39,290 --> 01:53:39,980
Yeah,

2647
01:53:39,980 --> 01:53:41,720
yeah.
There's no that's,

2648
01:53:41,810 --> 01:53:44,690
if it's not,
if they don't laugh,

2649
01:53:44,691 --> 01:53:45,524
it's not comedy.

2650
01:53:46,180 --> 01:53:49,000
You don't really know for sure where the
beats are.

2651
01:53:49,210 --> 01:53:52,240
You think you've got a pretty good
roadmap from all your experience,

2652
01:53:52,241 --> 01:53:54,100
but until you do it in front of a live
audience,

2653
01:53:54,130 --> 01:53:55,180
they're there to tell you.

2654
01:53:56,150 --> 01:54:01,150
So malanie just did this a mark twain
thing for Letterman.

2655
01:54:01,630 --> 01:54:03,770
The,
it was like the Mark Twain Prize and pbs

2656
01:54:03,771 --> 01:54:06,230
for David Letterman.
So it's like Steve Martin,

2657
01:54:06,231 --> 01:54:09,230
just Bill Murray,
everybody and John Malaney is doing it.

2658
01:54:09,470 --> 01:54:11,720
So He sends me his uh,
speech,

2659
01:54:12,230 --> 01:54:16,850
his like his bit and uh,
I'm reading it and it's whatever.

2660
01:54:16,851 --> 01:54:17,684
I'm like,
Hey,

2661
01:54:18,130 --> 01:54:19,850
like whatever.
Couple ideas.

2662
01:54:20,270 --> 01:54:21,103
And then,
uh,

2663
01:54:21,290 --> 01:54:26,290
so I watch it and he did align that like
killed like immediate,

2664
01:54:28,401 --> 01:54:31,250
like one of those things where they
laugh for a split second and then

2665
01:54:31,251 --> 01:54:32,480
immediately applaud

2666
01:54:32,760 --> 01:54:36,840
like fuck labbing right.
We have to go immediately to applause.

2667
01:54:37,170 --> 01:54:39,270
So,
and I was watching this and I was like,

2668
01:54:39,330 --> 01:54:44,220
I didn't even know that was a joke.
Like when I read it,

2669
01:54:44,221 --> 01:54:45,810
I was like my name though.
That was a joke.

2670
01:54:46,170 --> 01:54:50,040
So I texted Malanie I go,
did you,

2671
01:54:50,130 --> 01:54:52,170
was that a punchline to you?
And he goes,

2672
01:54:52,500 --> 01:54:55,530
nope,
I had no idea.

2673
01:54:55,880 --> 01:54:59,050
Two guys with a lot of experience,
no fucking idea.

2674
01:54:59,051 --> 01:55:01,690
And it got to like pause,
break like the bet,

2675
01:55:01,700 --> 01:55:04,560
the highlight of his part.
That's so didn't even know it was a

2676
01:55:04,561 --> 01:55:05,460
joke.
That's the,

2677
01:55:05,520 --> 01:55:07,770
and that's what an audience does that
you can't like,

2678
01:55:08,100 --> 01:55:09,390
oh,
now we're doing comedy.

2679
01:55:09,391 --> 01:55:11,310
I thought that was a straight,
I thought that was a,

2680
01:55:11,340 --> 01:55:12,510
just a metaphor.

2681
01:55:12,810 --> 01:55:14,850
You know,
I have an APP on my phone,

2682
01:55:14,880 --> 01:55:16,260
the uh,
sound app,

2683
01:55:16,261 --> 01:55:18,270
the voice notes App,
and when I,

2684
01:55:18,271 --> 01:55:21,540
you can look at it and you can edit the
voice notes.

2685
01:55:21,750 --> 01:55:23,880
And when you do,
when you go into the edit mode,

2686
01:55:23,881 --> 01:55:28,380
you can see the spikes.
And so I'm going over this one bit and I

2687
01:55:28,381 --> 01:55:33,090
look and there's this giant fucking
spike in this,

2688
01:55:33,091 --> 01:55:35,010
uh,
this Harvey Weinstein bit that I have.

2689
01:55:35,250 --> 01:55:39,490
And then I realized that the giant spike
is something that I didn't even know as

2690
01:55:39,500 --> 01:55:43,050
a punchline when I wrote it.
I was trying to set something else,

2691
01:55:43,470 --> 01:55:46,860
but the way it played out,
it got the biggest fucking laugh of the

2692
01:55:46,861 --> 01:55:48,780
entire bit.
And then you have to act like you meant

2693
01:55:48,781 --> 01:55:50,160
to do that,
like that whole thing.

2694
01:55:50,880 --> 01:55:52,530
And I'm like,
how the fuck did that?

2695
01:55:52,531 --> 01:55:55,350
And then I got off stage and Tony
Hinchcliffe said he'd go do that fucking

2696
01:55:55,351 --> 01:55:56,280
line.
It's so funny.

2697
01:55:56,281 --> 01:55:57,330
I'm like,
man,

2698
01:55:57,331 --> 01:55:59,100
I didn't even know what it was going to
be you.

2699
01:55:59,740 --> 01:56:00,573
No,
I can't

2700
01:56:01,380 --> 01:56:06,380
with saying I w I there is,
you did a thing that I was like that's a

2701
01:56:07,011 --> 01:56:08,070
fucking,
oh,

2702
01:56:08,071 --> 01:56:11,550
the thing I like that you said about,
it's like sometimes just like rapist,

2703
01:56:11,580 --> 01:56:12,600
just look like rape.

2704
01:56:14,880 --> 01:56:15,880
Oh,
that's what you're doing.

2705
01:56:15,920 --> 01:56:17,550
I'm hardly doing that.
But yeah,

2706
01:56:17,551 --> 01:56:19,400
like I say,
you shouldn't judge a book by its cover,

2707
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,710
but he wrote some thinks you're dead,
right?

2708
01:56:24,110 --> 01:56:25,910
Yeah,
I got it looks like you've rate look

2709
01:56:25,911 --> 01:56:28,860
sick fucking total piece of shit.
I mean what a trap it would be if you

2710
01:56:28,861 --> 01:56:30,840
look like that and you weren't a piece
of shit and you're like,

2711
01:56:30,841 --> 01:56:33,090
I'm a nice guy.
I'm the sweetest guy ever.

2712
01:56:33,190 --> 01:56:34,430
Uh,
yeah.

2713
01:56:34,431 --> 01:56:38,110
So there's no,
there's literally no knowing what you

2714
01:56:38,111 --> 01:56:39,790
know until you do it.
Like there's no,

2715
01:56:40,170 --> 01:56:42,310
it's a weird art form in that regard.
You know,

2716
01:56:42,311 --> 01:56:44,070
I was talking to Chris Stapleton about
that.

2717
01:56:44,071 --> 01:56:44,904
I was,
you know,

2718
01:56:45,060 --> 01:56:49,500
I was saying you write all your music
and then you perform it to the audience.

2719
01:56:49,501 --> 01:56:51,270
It's done.
And I'm like,

2720
01:56:51,271 --> 01:56:53,610
for a comic,
like that's so rare.

2721
01:56:53,640 --> 01:56:57,000
It's so rare that I write a bit that
comes out perfect.

2722
01:56:57,090 --> 01:56:58,830
Yeah.
And then I bring it to the stage and it

2723
01:56:58,831 --> 01:57:00,990
literally mirrors what I wrote down.

2724
01:57:01,610 --> 01:57:03,620
Yeah.
I mean sometimes,

2725
01:57:03,621 --> 01:57:07,190
but it's never,
there's also a thing,

2726
01:57:07,310 --> 01:57:12,310
I was reading something or listening to
something where like your brain

2727
01:57:14,600 --> 01:57:19,600
adrenaline will make your brain
do different shit meaning,

2728
01:57:20,751 --> 01:57:24,670
so you need to put your,
you need to that address.

2729
01:57:24,710 --> 01:57:27,290
Like you can have the map,
you can have your plan,

2730
01:57:27,860 --> 01:57:31,010
but then adrenaline will be like,
it's like you ever watch somebody,

2731
01:57:31,011 --> 01:57:33,200
uh,
uh,

2732
01:57:33,740 --> 01:57:35,150
Dave did something.
Did you say that?

2733
01:57:35,151 --> 01:57:38,330
DEF Comedy Jam 25th Anniversary.
So it's not very good,

2734
01:57:38,450 --> 01:57:42,260
but it's on that flex.
But here's the good,

2735
01:57:42,261 --> 01:57:45,530
it's not very good.
There's a sequence where Chappelle and

2736
01:57:45,531 --> 01:57:46,640
deal,
he uglier on

2737
01:57:48,230 --> 01:57:53,230
and Chappelle is so fucking funny.
It's truly breathtaking and he's

2738
01:57:55,101 --> 01:57:59,690
improvising the whole thing and it's
like so fucking breathtaking.

2739
01:57:59,720 --> 01:58:01,550
And I was there with Jimmy Carr,
the comedian.

2740
01:58:01,551 --> 01:58:03,920
I was like,
this is like when I'm impressed by

2741
01:58:03,921 --> 01:58:05,390
David's,
like he must,

2742
01:58:05,391 --> 01:58:07,940
cause I fucking know him.
Some of them was like this motherfucker

2743
01:58:07,970 --> 01:58:09,230
like,
and he's like,

2744
01:58:09,231 --> 01:58:11,240
yes,
but don't discount.

2745
01:58:11,241 --> 01:58:15,680
Don't assume that you couldn't have done
something because adrenaline does make

2746
01:58:15,681 --> 01:58:19,760
your brain do shit.
It kind of makes it like superhuman and

2747
01:58:19,761 --> 01:58:23,960
super like,
like make logic leaps that you wouldn't.

2748
01:58:24,590 --> 01:58:26,000
But I um,
in my,

2749
01:58:26,120 --> 01:58:30,470
in my line of work and like my eye,
that's going to be 10% ultimately of

2750
01:58:30,471 --> 01:58:33,980
like it's 90% written and then I'll 10%
say come up with some on stage.

2751
01:58:34,340 --> 01:58:35,330
Yeah.
Um,

2752
01:58:35,331 --> 01:58:37,120
when I'm intoxicated,
um,

2753
01:58:37,250 --> 01:58:40,460
uh,
more willing to take these big leaps

2754
01:58:40,480 --> 01:58:42,340
and,
and go into new rooms,

2755
01:58:42,670 --> 01:58:44,720
they're like,
take new new pass office stuff.

2756
01:58:44,740 --> 01:58:47,230
Like I'll take a wild,
especially marijuana,

2757
01:58:47,470 --> 01:58:50,580
like there's something about being high.
Whereas if I'm doing a bit and

2758
01:58:50,590 --> 01:58:52,360
especially a new bit where I'll go,
well,

2759
01:58:52,980 --> 01:58:54,560
what about his mom?
The fuck,

2760
01:58:55,060 --> 01:58:56,830
how's his mom feel about this?
Yeah.

2761
01:58:56,831 --> 01:58:58,630
That bitch has got to be like,
what did I do?

2762
01:58:58,810 --> 01:59:00,760
You know?
And then you'll have this whole nother

2763
01:59:00,761 --> 01:59:05,761
angle that it's almost like in the
moment it shows itself and then you have

2764
01:59:06,591 --> 01:59:08,090
to chase it down.
You have to have the courage,

2765
01:59:08,091 --> 01:59:10,580
chase it down,
live in front of a bunch of people that

2766
01:59:10,581 --> 01:59:12,200
paid to hear you talk.
Yeah.

2767
01:59:12,750 --> 01:59:16,830
And that's the risk you kind of,
that's where a hubris comes in.

2768
01:59:16,940 --> 01:59:17,661
Hmm.
Yeah.

2769
01:59:17,661 --> 01:59:18,800
That's where it's like,
yeah,

2770
01:59:18,830 --> 01:59:20,210
I don't know.
I know you paid.

2771
01:59:20,330 --> 01:59:21,260
Yeah.
Ah,

2772
01:59:21,740 --> 01:59:23,300
well this is how it's got to be done.
Yeah.

2773
01:59:23,370 --> 01:59:26,030
One of the good things about comedy
today is because of all these kinds of

2774
01:59:26,031 --> 01:59:28,490
conversations that we have,
people sort of understand the process

2775
01:59:28,491 --> 01:59:30,830
and particularly quality store.
Yeah.

2776
01:59:30,840 --> 01:59:34,550
They want to see the process play out.
Like I've talked to a guy the other day

2777
01:59:34,730 --> 01:59:35,750
that was like,
uh,

2778
01:59:35,780 --> 01:59:40,220
I came to see you while you were doing
that Bruce Jenner thing and I saw it

2779
01:59:40,221 --> 01:59:43,790
through all its incarnations.
I saw the early part was kind of clunky

2780
01:59:44,030 --> 01:59:45,710
and then I saw where it became the
finished thing,

2781
01:59:45,711 --> 01:59:47,360
which is your clothes and bid on the
special.

2782
01:59:47,690 --> 01:59:49,760
And he was like,
I saw you over a period of like three

2783
01:59:49,761 --> 01:59:51,140
times over eight months.
He was like,

2784
01:59:51,141 --> 01:59:52,460
it was really interesting.
Yeah.

2785
01:59:52,550 --> 01:59:54,380
Like they like it.
They're comping nerds.

2786
01:59:54,440 --> 01:59:55,273
Yeah.
Yes.

2787
01:59:55,390 --> 01:59:58,890
Ship held.
Thinks that's because of alternative

2788
01:59:58,891 --> 02:00:03,510
comedy.
He believes that one of the great things

2789
02:00:03,511 --> 02:00:08,511
about alt comedy was it brought people
into the process.

2790
02:00:10,350 --> 02:00:12,840
I think he's right.
I think it's all it's that in podcasts.

2791
02:00:13,080 --> 02:00:15,330
Yeah.
I think podcasts more so cause obviously

2792
02:00:15,331 --> 02:00:18,600
way more people listen to podcasts and
go to see alternative comedy shows.

2793
02:00:19,470 --> 02:00:22,200
I mean if you have one or two
alternative comedy shows in the city,

2794
02:00:22,590 --> 02:00:24,270
it's a big deal.
Like in La,

2795
02:00:24,300 --> 02:00:26,130
I mean how many are going on at night?
Three.

2796
02:00:26,280 --> 02:00:30,720
So you've got like what 900 people maybe
that are seeing alternative comedy and a

2797
02:00:30,720 --> 02:00:34,620
night.
Whereas podcasts thousands and thousands

2798
02:00:34,620 --> 02:00:35,910
and thousands if not millions and
millions.

2799
02:00:36,300 --> 02:00:38,520
I think that there's a bunch of things
going on though too.

2800
02:00:38,521 --> 02:00:43,521
It's like when you become a fan of it,
like I'm a fan of music and I don't

2801
02:00:43,711 --> 02:00:47,340
really like one of the things about
having Chris Stapleton and I just wanted

2802
02:00:47,341 --> 02:00:50,260
to ask him like how do you write jokes?
Like where they come from.

2803
02:00:50,460 --> 02:00:52,830
I always ask that.
It's such a dumb question but it's like

2804
02:00:52,860 --> 02:00:56,290
I don't have any idea what that's like.
I mean,

2805
02:00:56,291 --> 02:00:57,450
I said jokes,
I meant songs.

2806
02:00:57,490 --> 02:00:58,060
Yeah.
Um,

2807
02:00:58,060 --> 02:01:00,120
how do you know,
where does the music come from?

2808
02:01:00,121 --> 02:01:01,880
Do you have like a beat in your head?
I mean,

2809
02:01:02,120 --> 02:01:05,430
and his answer was there's a bunch of
different ways he does it.

2810
02:01:05,431 --> 02:01:07,170
You know,
sometimes you just sit in his car and

2811
02:01:07,171 --> 02:01:09,510
the thought just comes to him and he
starts singing into his phone.

2812
02:01:09,750 --> 02:01:10,590
Yeah.
You know?

2813
02:01:10,740 --> 02:01:11,670
Yeah.
That's the,

2814
02:01:11,790 --> 02:01:15,990
the uh,
Malanie did a joke or it's like an

2815
02:01:15,991 --> 02:01:17,580
anecdote in his act,
so I won't,

2816
02:01:17,610 --> 02:01:21,450
I won't blow it,
but like Mick Jagger was hosting snl and

2817
02:01:21,570 --> 02:01:25,270
some Malania was writing a song with him
and uh,

2818
02:01:25,500 --> 02:01:28,450
Malanie pitched something and Mick
Jagger goes

2819
02:01:28,830 --> 02:01:31,150
know,
like,

2820
02:01:31,170 --> 02:01:33,660
and he goes,
not fun a wow.

2821
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,290
It's like of like of lateral movement.
He's like,

2822
02:01:37,291 --> 02:01:38,940
yes,
but it's like,

2823
02:01:38,990 --> 02:01:41,790
okay.
I guess the songwriting

2824
02:01:43,340 --> 02:01:44,990
blogger,
you could kind of just say whatever the

2825
02:01:44,991 --> 02:01:45,970
fuck you want.
Yeah.

2826
02:01:46,220 --> 02:01:47,930
I mean,
you're like a seven year old man who

2827
02:01:47,931 --> 02:01:49,430
just had a baby.
Yeah.

2828
02:01:49,431 --> 02:01:52,430
Shooting loads into models and Brazil
and all over the world.

2829
02:01:52,520 --> 02:01:53,500
He just does whatever the fuck

2830
02:01:53,550 --> 02:01:55,470
do you find.
Speaking of which,

2831
02:01:55,471 --> 02:01:58,990
cause I was saying to somebody,
the in,

2832
02:01:59,020 --> 02:02:04,020
in light of like the Cosby,
you know that thing where people become,

2833
02:02:06,630 --> 02:02:08,010
I was saying like,
I always say,

2834
02:02:08,011 --> 02:02:11,970
beware of a moral arbiter.
Anyone who hold him to be aware of a

2835
02:02:11,971 --> 02:02:14,190
moral pillar cause why are you doing
this?

2836
02:02:14,520 --> 02:02:15,240
Right.
And why,

2837
02:02:15,240 --> 02:02:18,870
like what benefit,
you're not doing it for society.

2838
02:02:18,871 --> 02:02:21,420
You're not trying to benefit,
you're not trying to sell the good word.

2839
02:02:21,421 --> 02:02:23,270
You're not,
you're literally just being soupy of

2840
02:02:23,280 --> 02:02:24,990
superior dickhead.
Right.

2841
02:02:25,530 --> 02:02:30,390
Which was cosby's move 100%.
Do you think,

2842
02:02:30,930 --> 02:02:35,930
have you noticed what,
what adulation has done to your

2843
02:02:39,520 --> 02:02:44,520
personality?
Have you noticed a little creep?

2844
02:02:44,890 --> 02:02:48,330
Have you noticed that creep of like,
oh I've,

2845
02:02:48,430 --> 02:02:50,620
that,
that's Shitty or you know what I mean?

2846
02:02:51,430 --> 02:02:52,510
I don't,
and by the way,

2847
02:02:52,511 --> 02:02:54,820
I'm not saying this like,
cause I can think of what Joe,

2848
02:02:54,970 --> 02:02:56,680
I'm just saying like are there moments
where you're like,

2849
02:02:56,710 --> 02:02:57,280
oh,
like,

2850
02:02:57,280 --> 02:02:59,110
cause I don't know,
I'm,

2851
02:02:59,380 --> 02:03:02,260
you're,
you're more popular than,

2852
02:03:02,290 --> 02:03:03,123
you know what I mean?
Like,

2853
02:03:03,760 --> 02:03:05,800
than I am.
So I'm just wondering like have you

2854
02:03:05,801 --> 02:03:09,700
noticed anything uh,
happening then you were like,

2855
02:03:09,720 --> 02:03:10,330
yeah.

2856
02:03:10,330 --> 02:03:12,430
It's interesting.
You gotta be careful of it for sure.

2857
02:03:12,431 --> 02:03:14,290
Yeah.
I think I felt it a lot more when I was

2858
02:03:14,291 --> 02:03:16,360
younger or uh,
you know,

2859
02:03:17,470 --> 02:03:18,303
just dumber.

2860
02:03:19,730 --> 02:03:22,250
I think you're,
you're just always aware.

2861
02:03:22,910 --> 02:03:27,910
The worst thing that you could do as a
comic is lose your objectivity.

2862
02:03:29,390 --> 02:03:31,430
Objectivity.
You have let it slip away instead of let

2863
02:03:31,431 --> 02:03:34,400
it increase.
I think in order to be a good comic,

2864
02:03:34,401 --> 02:03:39,320
you have to be introspective.
It's Africa until it's very subjective.

2865
02:03:39,460 --> 02:03:41,120
Yeah.
Until you're sure of it.

2866
02:03:41,410 --> 02:03:42,350
Right.
And then it's like,

2867
02:03:42,351 --> 02:03:43,190
no,
fuck you.

2868
02:03:43,430 --> 02:03:45,320
Right.
That's where that he was going to then.

2869
02:03:45,620 --> 02:03:46,780
Yeah,
I man,

2870
02:03:46,781 --> 02:03:50,120
she think perspective,
you know?

2871
02:03:50,150 --> 02:03:53,390
I mean that's one of the reasons why I
like pot because it makes me insecure.

2872
02:03:53,450 --> 02:03:55,970
Yeah.
Legitimately I like,

2873
02:03:56,270 --> 02:04:00,980
I liked that Dana emery or ability and
ever like insecure define insecure

2874
02:04:01,190 --> 02:04:03,830
vulnerability,
like insecure about the future,

2875
02:04:03,831 --> 02:04:06,170
about life itself.
About like realizing like,

2876
02:04:06,171 --> 02:04:07,330
wow,
I can any moment now.

2877
02:04:07,350 --> 02:04:09,020
Fucking earthquake can happen at any
moment.

2878
02:04:09,021 --> 02:04:12,620
Now we get hit by an asteroid.
The cells in my body literally only have

2879
02:04:12,621 --> 02:04:15,590
about 50 years will left of life,
if I'm lucky.

2880
02:04:15,760 --> 02:04:17,000
Yeah.
If everything works out great,

2881
02:04:17,390 --> 02:04:18,320
you know,
all that stuff.

2882
02:04:18,420 --> 02:04:21,200
I'm worrying about my children,
worrying about my family,

2883
02:04:21,201 --> 02:04:22,190
worrying about,
you know,

2884
02:04:22,880 --> 02:04:24,980
all those things are real.
You know,

2885
02:04:24,981 --> 02:04:25,421
that,
that,

2886
02:04:25,421 --> 02:04:29,180
those sort of vulnerabilities there are
highlighted by marijuana.

2887
02:04:29,200 --> 02:04:32,600
The,
the awareness of your own imminent

2888
02:04:32,601 --> 02:04:36,470
demise and just life itself being so
fucking Uber Bizarre.

2889
02:04:36,500 --> 02:04:38,100
Like all those are highlighted

2890
02:04:38,100 --> 02:04:40,350
by marijuana and which is one of the
things I like about it,

2891
02:04:40,650 --> 02:04:45,650
that ruthless introspective quality of
pot that people call paranoia.

2892
02:04:46,411 --> 02:04:47,700
I get paranoid.
Well,

2893
02:04:47,730 --> 02:04:52,730
I just think that's hyper awareness,
which is why like hugs feel so good when

2894
02:04:53,161 --> 02:04:55,260
you're high.
If you're high and you hug somebody,

2895
02:04:55,261 --> 02:04:55,920
like,
oh,

2896
02:04:55,920 --> 02:04:58,860
give me a hug.
Like I just feel so much better.

2897
02:04:58,861 --> 02:05:01,260
It feels so warm.
Like food feels better.

2898
02:05:01,261 --> 02:05:03,330
It's like you're way more aware.
I work out.

2899
02:05:03,331 --> 02:05:06,450
Hi.
One of my favorite things to do is I did

2900
02:05:06,451 --> 02:05:07,920
it yesterday.
I had this meeting here.

2901
02:05:07,921 --> 02:05:09,510
I did a podcast and then have to a
meeting.

2902
02:05:09,840 --> 02:05:10,673
Um,
uh,

2903
02:05:10,740 --> 02:05:15,660
I had like two hours before the meeting
so I smoked a joint and I hit the bag.

2904
02:05:15,690 --> 02:05:18,330
I just went over to the heavy bag and it
worked out for like 45 minutes.

2905
02:05:18,331 --> 02:05:21,630
And just man,
it's like you're so aware of all the

2906
02:05:21,631 --> 02:05:25,050
muscle tissue moving you like feel your
body different.

2907
02:05:25,320 --> 02:05:26,580
It like,
especially for me,

2908
02:05:26,581 --> 02:05:29,040
like for martial arts techniques,
I really,

2909
02:05:29,041 --> 02:05:33,270
I'm really aware of the correct way to
utilize leverage and weight.

2910
02:05:33,280 --> 02:05:36,390
It all comes together.
It's just hyper awareness that

2911
02:05:36,391 --> 02:05:41,340
hyperawareness also makes you like hyper
focused on yourself and your flaws and

2912
02:05:41,730 --> 02:05:43,420
the way you interact with people.
I all,

2913
02:05:43,470 --> 02:05:47,790
I never feel confident when I smoke a
lot of pot.

2914
02:05:47,820 --> 02:05:52,380
I always feel vulnerable and I always
feel like I should apologize to people

2915
02:05:52,381 --> 02:05:54,540
for something.
It's always like something that happened

2916
02:05:54,541 --> 02:05:55,560
like a month ago.
Like,

2917
02:05:55,561 --> 02:05:56,460
oh,
I was I a dick.

2918
02:05:56,590 --> 02:05:58,560
You feel like a woman basically.
Exactly.

2919
02:05:58,710 --> 02:06:00,870
Feel emotional or more vulnerable in
woman.

2920
02:06:00,871 --> 02:06:03,420
Constantly apologetic.
Well that's one of the reasons why a lot

2921
02:06:03,421 --> 02:06:03,610
of fun,

2922
02:06:03,610 --> 02:06:05,920
but don't think of marijuana as being a
manly thing.

2923
02:06:05,921 --> 02:06:08,020
You know,
marijuana is like very feminine and a

2924
02:06:08,021 --> 02:06:12,100
lot of ways very nurturing.
It's really a community sort of a drug

2925
02:06:12,370 --> 02:06:15,130
in the sense that it's not something you
want to be by herself with.

2926
02:06:15,310 --> 02:06:18,040
It's something you want to be like with
a community of friends.

2927
02:06:18,041 --> 02:06:19,330
It's been,
it makes you very,

2928
02:06:19,850 --> 02:06:21,940
it makes you,
it's a friendly drug.

2929
02:06:22,190 --> 02:06:23,540
Yeah.
That's what I realized.

2930
02:06:23,570 --> 02:06:24,920
I didn't,
I never really,

2931
02:06:24,980 --> 02:06:29,980
I've gotten drunk.
I got drunk in 2005 and I realize like,

2932
02:06:30,380 --> 02:06:32,540
oh,
this is the value I,

2933
02:06:32,570 --> 02:06:35,200
what I realized is it's all of us sit in
a,

2934
02:06:35,290 --> 02:06:40,010
in a row boat and we just slowly shoot
holes in the boat and we all just slowly

2935
02:06:40,011 --> 02:06:42,470
sink at the same,
we're just getting dry and you're just

2936
02:06:42,471 --> 02:06:44,720
sinking and sinking,
but you're doing it together.

2937
02:06:45,160 --> 02:06:48,560
So it's like nice.
And that's what it sounds like.

2938
02:06:48,561 --> 02:06:49,580
You're describing weed.
It's like,

2939
02:06:49,660 --> 02:06:51,430
well Duh.
Being honorable,

2940
02:06:51,460 --> 02:06:54,080
collected,
all the alcohol is going to come at a

2941
02:06:54,081 --> 02:06:56,510
price.
There's no real price for the weed.

2942
02:06:56,590 --> 02:06:59,240
Yeah.
For me at least I don't have the price

2943
02:06:59,420 --> 02:07:00,710
when it's over,
I feel fine.

2944
02:07:00,740 --> 02:07:01,573
Like,
I don't feel like,

2945
02:07:01,970 --> 02:07:02,691
like,
oh my God,

2946
02:07:02,691 --> 02:07:05,360
my head's pounding.
What the fuck did I do last night like

2947
02:07:05,361 --> 02:07:07,730
that,
that I got drunk with my buddies thing.

2948
02:07:07,731 --> 02:07:10,610
We had the best time,
we were laughing and high five and,

2949
02:07:10,611 --> 02:07:12,830
and howling and crying,
laughing.

2950
02:07:12,831 --> 02:07:15,680
But then the next morning like,
oh my God,

2951
02:07:16,370 --> 02:07:19,550
your head is fucking pounding pot
doesn't give you that part,

2952
02:07:19,580 --> 02:07:20,413
you know?
Yeah.

2953
02:07:20,660 --> 02:07:21,850
What was the,
um,

2954
02:07:22,010 --> 02:07:25,220
so you had gone through a series of
ketamine there.

2955
02:07:25,340 --> 02:07:26,570
Oh yeah,
I did.

2956
02:07:26,571 --> 02:07:28,790
Uh,
I did the tms.

2957
02:07:28,850 --> 02:07:29,683
The,
uh,

2958
02:07:30,110 --> 02:07:34,170
cause I was looking to at the last time
was here was [inaudible] mag,

2959
02:07:34,250 --> 02:07:38,380
transcranial magnetic stimulation and
which worked that men,

2960
02:07:38,440 --> 02:07:40,450
the problem was,
and I think,

2961
02:07:40,480 --> 02:07:41,770
I don't know if I talked about on here
and not,

2962
02:07:42,400 --> 02:07:46,450
I h someone gave me some hgh.
Did they tell you that human growth

2963
02:07:46,451 --> 02:07:47,284
hormone?
Yeah,

2964
02:07:47,560 --> 02:07:51,100
basically.
So I did tms,

2965
02:07:51,130 --> 02:07:53,980
which transcranial magnetic stimulation,
45 sessions.

2966
02:07:54,250 --> 02:07:57,160
It worked great.
Like it literally has stuck taking,

2967
02:07:57,161 --> 02:08:01,640
it takes like 35 minutes and they just
put like electrodes on you or something?

2968
02:08:01,650 --> 02:08:02,860
Yeah,
I think I have video.

2969
02:08:03,020 --> 02:08:04,240
Um,
they put,

2970
02:08:04,270 --> 02:08:05,830
uh,
they put,

2971
02:08:05,920 --> 02:08:07,870
um,
the,

2972
02:08:07,871 --> 02:08:09,280
yeah,
they put video on,

2973
02:08:10,740 --> 02:08:14,980
uh,
looking at Chris Rock sends me every

2974
02:08:15,010 --> 02:08:17,710
single uh,
uh,

2975
02:08:17,920 --> 02:08:19,810
rape thing.
Oh my God.

2976
02:08:20,140 --> 02:08:25,140
Everything that comes in every sink,
every page six f literally he sent me 25

2977
02:08:25,391 --> 02:08:26,050
of these.

2978
02:08:26,050 --> 02:08:27,970
I don't know,
it's just like a thing now because then

2979
02:08:27,971 --> 02:08:31,810
we go like,
it's just like a ticket.

2980
02:08:32,080 --> 02:08:35,800
So for the morning there's so many guys,
Mario Batali,

2981
02:08:36,310 --> 02:08:38,740
and by the way,
the more salacious they can make these

2982
02:08:38,741 --> 02:08:39,521
stories,
the better.

2983
02:08:39,521 --> 02:08:42,490
They were talking about some room that
Mario would take people up to and the

2984
02:08:42,491 --> 02:08:45,280
third floor was the rape.
Like what in the fuck.

2985
02:08:45,281 --> 02:08:48,770
All that makes me laugh is the,
the uh,

2986
02:08:48,850 --> 02:08:50,470
you know,
it makes me laugh is the um,

2987
02:08:51,310 --> 02:08:54,820
the pictures of Louis got progressively
worse and worse.

2988
02:08:55,210 --> 02:08:57,610
Oh,
the ones that get fined like the New

2989
02:08:57,610 --> 02:08:59,320
York Times,
I was waiting for them to just put up a

2990
02:08:59,321 --> 02:09:02,450
picture of Lee Harvey Oswald fucking
hits.

2991
02:09:02,470 --> 02:09:04,000
You don't have to find the Shitty
shittiest.

2992
02:09:04,001 --> 02:09:08,710
The guilty is looking picture of,
there's so much video of him beating off

2993
02:09:09,030 --> 02:09:10,970
like air beating off,
you know,

2994
02:09:11,260 --> 02:09:12,620
play that video.
This,

2995
02:09:12,710 --> 02:09:15,060
this is you guys the last time I was
here,

2996
02:09:15,090 --> 02:09:16,340
this is on the line.
Yes.

2997
02:09:16,360 --> 02:09:18,000
From last time you were here.
Yeah.

2998
02:09:20,170 --> 02:09:21,160
Wow.
Look at that man.

2999
02:09:21,940 --> 02:09:24,970
Give me some volume knowing about it.
I went to this.

3000
02:09:25,930 --> 02:09:30,430
Whoa dude,
that sound is like an Mri.

3001
02:09:30,970 --> 02:09:32,530
That's what it is.
Yes,

3002
02:09:32,740 --> 02:09:34,290
that's right.
We talked about last week,

3003
02:09:34,610 --> 02:09:36,220
um,
the uh,

3004
02:09:36,580 --> 02:09:37,321
but uh,
case.

3005
02:09:37,321 --> 02:09:41,380
So then the problem was after that I did
hgh for someone gave me some hgh and I

3006
02:09:41,381 --> 02:09:41,780
was like,
yeah,

3007
02:09:41,780 --> 02:09:43,240
I'll fucking take you.
I don't give a shit.

3008
02:09:43,330 --> 02:09:44,210
Yeah,
I'll take a shit.

3009
02:09:44,530 --> 02:09:49,060
I'm always looking for an advantage.
And I started having panic attacks from

3010
02:09:49,061 --> 02:09:50,050
Hga.
Yes.

3011
02:09:50,230 --> 02:09:51,041
Which is a,
we,

3012
02:09:51,041 --> 02:09:54,640
it's a narrow side effect,
but it's one of the side effects of hgh.

3013
02:09:54,940 --> 02:09:57,910
Basically.
It like supercharged my whole system.

3014
02:09:58,150 --> 02:10:02,710
I started having panic attacks on stage.
I had a panic attack the night before.

3015
02:10:02,711 --> 02:10:06,000
I take three mikes.
Why couldn't go onstage?

3016
02:10:06,350 --> 02:10:09,130
Spade was supposed to bring me on and I
told Adam,

3017
02:10:09,131 --> 02:10:11,020
I was like,
I can't go on.

3018
02:10:11,050 --> 02:10:14,620
I literally couldn't breathe well night
before.

3019
02:10:14,630 --> 02:10:15,850
Yeah,
it was,

3020
02:10:17,090 --> 02:10:18,970
thankfully it did.
Yes.

3021
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:21,190
I thankfully didn't get one that night.
Like,

3022
02:10:21,220 --> 02:10:22,570
oh my God,
dude,

3023
02:10:22,690 --> 02:10:24,850
trust me,
trust me.

3024
02:10:24,851 --> 02:10:28,690
And then I,
and then I had anxiety for months.

3025
02:10:28,840 --> 02:10:31,360
Literally like,
just like when people say I have

3026
02:10:31,361 --> 02:10:32,890
anxiety,
I had never had,

3027
02:10:33,230 --> 02:10:34,010
it was like,
I'm not an

3028
02:10:34,010 --> 02:10:35,930
anxious person.
I wouldn't even know what that's like.

3029
02:10:36,020 --> 02:10:38,450
Wow.
It's fucking miserable.

3030
02:10:38,860 --> 02:10:40,850
It's,
to me it was worse than depression

3031
02:10:40,851 --> 02:10:45,851
because you're agitated and like you
just feel like static.

3032
02:10:46,731 --> 02:10:49,760
It just was like a static over your
body.

3033
02:10:49,761 --> 02:10:50,594
It was like,
you're,

3034
02:10:50,600 --> 02:10:53,540
you just have like this,
like cortisol,

3035
02:10:54,110 --> 02:10:57,290
snow in your,
and it's sucked.

3036
02:10:57,350 --> 02:11:01,100
So I went back on a,
on a Zoloft,

3037
02:11:01,760 --> 02:11:02,580
um,
to,

3038
02:11:02,580 --> 02:11:07,130
and then it ended the anxiety now.
But you are trying to get yourself off

3039
02:11:07,131 --> 02:11:08,870
of that stuff.
So now I'm going to go,

3040
02:11:08,940 --> 02:11:10,490
I'm,
I'm back on,

3041
02:11:10,540 --> 02:11:13,250
I just stopped taking it all off like
two weeks ago.

3042
02:11:13,480 --> 02:11:16,580
How did you can't,
I feel actually really good because,

3043
02:11:16,610 --> 02:11:17,720
oh,
here's what I didn't say.

3044
02:11:18,080 --> 02:11:21,860
I also micro dosed do,
uh,

3045
02:11:21,920 --> 02:11:24,830
while it was on Zoloft,
I microdose shrooms,

3046
02:11:25,640 --> 02:11:27,290
uh,
like three times,

3047
02:11:27,770 --> 02:11:31,820
which is actually like pretty fun.
It's Super Fun,

3048
02:11:31,850 --> 02:11:34,460
but it's like not daunting.

3049
02:11:34,490 --> 02:11:36,500
It's not that you're not like,
it's not trippy,

3050
02:11:36,560 --> 02:11:37,560
right?
You're not like,

3051
02:11:38,020 --> 02:11:39,140
oh yeah,
you just feel good.

3052
02:11:39,380 --> 02:11:42,110
Uh,
I did that three times a did lsd once

3053
02:11:42,320 --> 02:11:43,580
and I,
I'm thinking of,

3054
02:11:43,610 --> 02:11:46,440
so now I'm going off and,
and,

3055
02:11:46,660 --> 02:11:51,660
and interesting happened when I
microdosed I got significantly less

3056
02:11:52,191 --> 02:11:56,270
angry just as like an operating
principle.

3057
02:11:56,900 --> 02:11:57,770
Like I was just like,
oh,

3058
02:11:57,771 --> 02:12:01,790
I'm less angry.
Like I just didn't feel as like snappy

3059
02:12:01,791 --> 02:12:06,791
and shitting like for a long,
for like a,

3060
02:12:07,310 --> 02:12:10,250
like an a b over big period.
I've got a buddy of mine who's a world

3061
02:12:10,251 --> 02:12:12,620
champion kickboxer he mocked her doses
and he fights on,

3062
02:12:12,621 --> 02:12:16,670
it fights high on mushrooms.
Do they test for it or they,

3063
02:12:16,671 --> 02:12:17,540
it's just,
nope,

3064
02:12:18,050 --> 02:12:19,790
that's fine.
I fucking people up while he's on

3065
02:12:19,791 --> 02:12:20,840
mushrooms.
That's great.

3066
02:12:20,870 --> 02:12:23,300
And I mean better than he's ever looked
in his past.

3067
02:12:23,660 --> 02:12:25,880
He said he could see things coming
before they happen.

3068
02:12:25,910 --> 02:12:27,860
Yup.
He said literally feels like he's got

3069
02:12:27,861 --> 02:12:29,810
some sort of psychic ability when he's
sparring,

3070
02:12:30,110 --> 02:12:32,300
like he sees what guys are doing and if
you watch him fight,

3071
02:12:32,301 --> 02:12:35,690
he just looks way sharper than he's ever
looked before at home.

3072
02:12:35,691 --> 02:12:37,310
Boys doing mushrooms.
Yeah.

3073
02:12:37,550 --> 02:12:39,170
Then that's the,
so I've been,

3074
02:12:39,250 --> 02:12:41,990
I stopped taking it the love because you
can't,

3075
02:12:42,790 --> 02:12:44,420
uh,
you can't be on it.

3076
02:12:44,421 --> 02:12:47,050
And do I have a game?
Uh,

3077
02:12:47,660 --> 02:12:48,560
you can,
uh,

3078
02:12:48,590 --> 02:12:51,830
you risk serotonin syndrome,
which is like it too much serotonin in

3079
02:12:51,831 --> 02:12:53,040
your body or yeah.
Yeah.

3080
02:12:53,520 --> 02:12:58,250
So we're the first guy that tell me
about five htp before we even started

3081
02:12:58,251 --> 02:13:00,950
selling it at all,
before we started having a mood.

3082
02:13:01,250 --> 02:13:04,100
You were telling me about five htp and
that you were sandy.

3083
02:13:04,101 --> 02:13:06,260
Dan told me about no shit.
Yeah.

3084
02:13:06,261 --> 02:13:10,250
Cause I,
he saw me some ecstasy and he was like,

3085
02:13:10,280 --> 02:13:12,830
yeah,
and also take this the next day.

3086
02:13:13,070 --> 02:13:13,650
And it was like,
Oh God.

3087
02:13:13,650 --> 02:13:15,260
And then I like research and I was like,
oh,

3088
02:13:15,261 --> 02:13:18,280
I should just take.
So I still take that five HDP.

3089
02:13:18,320 --> 02:13:20,960
I think it's good for weight loss.
Really.

3090
02:13:21,050 --> 02:13:23,510
Um,
it like when I take five htp,

3091
02:13:23,511 --> 02:13:25,690
I'm just not hungry.
Um,

3092
02:13:25,940 --> 02:13:30,940
it like that was the other sort of weird
side effect of the microdosing my

3093
02:13:32,040 --> 02:13:35,940
appetite went down like significantly
across the board.

3094
02:13:36,400 --> 02:13:38,370
One,
how much of the appetite is not really

3095
02:13:38,371 --> 02:13:42,120
how much food you need,
but rather you need something to do.

3096
02:13:42,800 --> 02:13:46,950
Yeah.
Or it's just like at this time of day I

3097
02:13:46,951 --> 02:13:48,860
do this.
Um,

3098
02:13:49,380 --> 02:13:52,890
but I ended up like losing 10 pounds.
That's interesting to me.

3099
02:13:53,030 --> 02:13:57,960
Like 50 firm,
I've lost 12 pounds from like one 59,

3100
02:13:57,961 --> 02:13:59,880
nine one 47.
Wow.

3101
02:13:59,940 --> 02:14:03,300
Yeah.
But it's not like a,

3102
02:14:03,690 --> 02:14:05,290
not starving myself or anything.
Right.

3103
02:14:05,310 --> 02:14:06,480
So you didn't feel uncomfortable?

3104
02:14:06,510 --> 02:14:07,500
No,
not at all.

3105
02:14:07,750 --> 02:14:08,583
He was like,
yeah.

3106
02:14:09,480 --> 02:14:11,790
Yeah.
Do you monitor your diet?

3107
02:14:11,820 --> 02:14:12,630
Are you,
do,

3108
02:14:12,630 --> 02:14:14,100
are you eating healthy?
Yeah.

3109
02:14:14,101 --> 02:14:18,420
Like I got my blood tested probably
three months ago and everything was

3110
02:14:18,570 --> 02:14:19,980
good.
Do you,

3111
02:14:19,981 --> 02:14:23,580
are you eating sugar and bread and
things like I've eaten,

3112
02:14:23,640 --> 02:14:26,700
I've stopped.
Uh,

3113
02:14:26,701 --> 02:14:30,390
I've eaten.
I used to be a big dessert person and I

3114
02:14:30,391 --> 02:14:34,170
kind of just like,
I think the mushrooms might've maybe

3115
02:14:34,171 --> 02:14:35,004
just kinda like,
Eh,

3116
02:14:35,270 --> 02:14:36,870
you know,
things that you don't,

3117
02:14:37,440 --> 02:14:38,610
um,
don't sugar.

3118
02:14:38,670 --> 02:14:40,140
You know,
the thing with sugar is you don't need

3119
02:14:40,141 --> 02:14:42,210
it for three days if you don't want it.
Right.

3120
02:14:42,270 --> 02:14:43,950
Like you just,
your body doesn't like,

3121
02:14:43,951 --> 02:14:46,530
you got to fucking get us some sugar.
You're just like,

3122
02:14:46,531 --> 02:14:48,900
Eh,
I'm good once you cut free.

3123
02:14:49,470 --> 02:14:51,210
Yeah.
And especially if you're really

3124
02:14:51,540 --> 02:14:55,770
conscious about what you're eating in
terms of like probiotics and things that

3125
02:14:55,800 --> 02:15:00,090
sort of help the landscape,
the biome landscape,

3126
02:15:00,091 --> 02:15:02,280
and make sure you've got healthy things
in there.

3127
02:15:02,370 --> 02:15:06,090
I think that's so significant.
And the more researchers that I talked

3128
02:15:06,091 --> 02:15:10,080
to and the more people that are
nutrition experts to start talking about

3129
02:15:10,980 --> 02:15:15,480
your gut biome and how important it is
to take the proper probiotics.

3130
02:15:15,500 --> 02:15:17,280
Yeah.
I think it affects your personality.

3131
02:15:17,281 --> 02:15:21,240
I think it affects your immune system.
I think it affects virtually the path of

3132
02:15:21,241 --> 02:15:24,450
your life that you take depending upon
what foods you eat.

3133
02:15:24,630 --> 02:15:27,150
It has a different effect on how you
live your life.

3134
02:15:27,180 --> 02:15:28,200
Well,
that's meditation.

3135
02:15:28,201 --> 02:15:32,970
Does the same thing cause you're like
you get a feeling for meditation and

3136
02:15:32,971 --> 02:15:36,210
then you're like,
do I want to spoil this with like

3137
02:15:36,211 --> 02:15:39,080
garbage thinking or behavior like
coming?

3138
02:15:39,090 --> 02:15:42,780
Just try to bring a bit of that in here
in my every day.

3139
02:15:43,170 --> 02:15:45,210
Yeah.
I mean that's the tank for me.

3140
02:15:45,510 --> 02:15:49,080
Yeah.
The tank is literally forgot about tanks

3141
02:15:49,920 --> 02:15:54,210
until you and I'm like,
I live like a block from float lab.

3142
02:15:54,420 --> 02:15:56,250
You got to go like I,
I went,

3143
02:15:56,340 --> 02:15:58,440
I went.
I think you must.

3144
02:15:58,441 --> 02:16:03,300
How long have you been doing this?
2002 was the first time I got one.

3145
02:16:03,450 --> 02:16:05,760
When,
when did you start doing the podcast?

3146
02:16:07,170 --> 02:16:10,950
I think you told me about it.
You told me about it.

3147
02:16:10,980 --> 02:16:15,900
I went to float lab.
Had the thought in the,

3148
02:16:16,170 --> 02:16:18,990
in the tank.
You got to love something.

3149
02:16:20,160 --> 02:16:22,260
Literally that was the thought.
I had an and then I got a dog.

3150
02:16:24,360 --> 02:16:26,430
Literally like he's always like,
I fucking,

3151
02:16:26,550 --> 02:16:27,810
yeah,
like that,

3152
02:16:27,840 --> 02:16:29,710
that I'd like that shit.
Like,

3153
02:16:29,711 --> 02:16:30,070
and I just

3154
02:16:30,070 --> 02:16:32,950
forget that it exists.
The tanks.

3155
02:16:32,980 --> 02:16:33,750
Yeah,

3156
02:16:33,750 --> 02:16:35,490
I think they're giant.
I think it's only one of them.

3157
02:16:35,510 --> 02:16:37,080
It's,
it's one of those things that requires

3158
02:16:37,081 --> 02:16:39,810
you to block off a chunk of your time.
So if you're a busy person,

3159
02:16:39,811 --> 02:16:40,644
it's hard to,
yeah,

3160
02:16:40,710 --> 02:16:42,510
it's hard to pull that up.
But I think it's like one of the most

3161
02:16:42,511 --> 02:16:44,480
important things you could do.
How often you do it?

3162
02:16:44,790 --> 02:16:47,260
Well,
I haven't done it a long time because I

3163
02:16:47,280 --> 02:16:50,160
took the one out of my basement and I
had it installed here.

3164
02:16:50,500 --> 02:16:51,870
Got It.
Took me a few,

3165
02:16:51,970 --> 02:16:54,660
a few times off and we just got it put
in two days ago.

3166
02:16:54,661 --> 02:16:58,140
So I haven't even been in it.
So I haven't been a tank at all and

3167
02:16:58,260 --> 02:16:59,490
three months.
Oh Wow.

3168
02:16:59,880 --> 02:17:00,900
Two months,
two months,

3169
02:17:00,901 --> 02:17:02,760
something like that.
How often do you think you'll do it now?

3170
02:17:03,380 --> 02:17:05,700
A couple of days a week.
A couple days a week is good.

3171
02:17:05,701 --> 02:17:07,800
If I give myself two days a week,
I'm happy.

3172
02:17:08,460 --> 02:17:11,760
Do you ever go in and just think about
your daughters?

3173
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:13,530
Yeah,
sure.

3174
02:17:13,531 --> 02:17:14,220
Yeah.
Yeah.

3175
02:17:14,220 --> 02:17:15,420
Like is it,
so it's not,

3176
02:17:15,450 --> 02:17:18,630
I don't like have a plan.
Sometimes I have a plan,

3177
02:17:18,631 --> 02:17:21,990
like maybe I'll have a bit that I'm
trying to work out and I just like this

3178
02:17:21,991 --> 02:17:23,220
bed.
It's just clunky.

3179
02:17:23,221 --> 02:17:26,400
There's a part of it that's clunky.
I'll smoke some pot and climbing that

3180
02:17:26,401 --> 02:17:27,770
tank and think about it.

3181
02:17:28,010 --> 02:17:29,630
There's a in the,
in the,

3182
02:17:29,690 --> 02:17:32,780
the,
there's like a pre

3183
02:17:34,610 --> 02:17:38,630
fucking syllabus for the Ibogaine and
it's like,

3184
02:17:38,660 --> 02:17:43,460
you need to come with questions.
Ooh for Ibogaine,

3185
02:17:43,970 --> 02:17:46,190
whoa.
First Sweet Lady Ibogaine.

3186
02:17:46,280 --> 02:17:48,260
Whoa.
And it's like,

3187
02:17:48,350 --> 02:17:50,000
I have to write.
And then a friend of mine was like,

3188
02:17:50,001 --> 02:17:52,880
can you ask a question for me?
It's like,

3189
02:17:52,881 --> 02:17:54,510
no,
I don't think that's legal.

3190
02:17:54,511 --> 02:17:55,000
Like he'd be like

3191
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:56,410
Kate.
So where Lucy

3192
02:17:58,630 --> 02:18:03,190
needs advice or news about what's going
on with her feet?

3193
02:18:05,190 --> 02:18:08,640
Oh yeah.
But I'm like looking forward to asking,

3194
02:18:09,570 --> 02:18:13,080
asking big questions.
Although I gotta say the last year has

3195
02:18:13,081 --> 02:18:15,840
been very revealing for me in terms of
like what,

3196
02:18:15,900 --> 02:18:18,210
what's important,
what's valuable.

3197
02:18:18,570 --> 02:18:22,020
So how much of an effect did having a
dog have on you getting a dog,

3198
02:18:22,021 --> 02:18:23,880
something you love and you come home
too?

3199
02:18:25,170 --> 02:18:27,210
Probably like 15,
20%.

3200
02:18:27,240 --> 02:18:29,490
He's just a fucking good dude to have
around.

3201
02:18:29,550 --> 02:18:31,260
Yeah.
Do you see that there was an article a

3202
02:18:31,261 --> 02:18:36,261
couple of weeks ago about dogs are so
inbred that they're basically retarded.

3203
02:18:39,030 --> 02:18:41,940
They have some wheat,
Jamie,

3204
02:18:41,941 --> 02:18:44,970
when you look it up cause it's,
they have some,

3205
02:18:45,660 --> 02:18:49,890
we've just aunt just piles and piles and
piles and generations of integrating

3206
02:18:50,310 --> 02:18:55,310
that they have this disease that's
tantamount to down syndrome that all

3207
02:18:55,741 --> 02:18:56,620
dogs have this.
Yeah.

3208
02:18:56,960 --> 02:18:58,650
Really?
Wow.

3209
02:18:59,100 --> 02:19:00,870
Um,
other than,

3210
02:19:01,200 --> 02:19:02,730
yeah,
I would assume other than like German

3211
02:19:02,731 --> 02:19:04,380
shit,
like the most highly trained German

3212
02:19:04,381 --> 02:19:06,420
shepherds are like,
I'm not like them

3213
02:19:06,770 --> 02:19:09,320
got a golden retriever that's a year old
now.

3214
02:19:09,410 --> 02:19:11,090
And when I come home like,
uh,

3215
02:19:11,091 --> 02:19:13,190
he's the only one that's awake,
you know,

3216
02:19:13,191 --> 02:19:15,290
I'll come home from the store and you
know,

3217
02:19:15,291 --> 02:19:17,240
everybody else is asleep and I come home
much

3218
02:19:17,330 --> 02:19:18,480
my dude

3219
02:19:19,200 --> 02:19:22,390
and he's running around me and the
mining and kissing me and

3220
02:19:22,620 --> 02:19:23,540
yeah,
just like good.

3221
02:19:23,840 --> 02:19:27,090
Feels good.
Just like good fucking good dude.

3222
02:19:27,380 --> 02:19:28,213
Yeah.

3223
02:19:28,730 --> 02:19:30,460
I take him running.
Yeah.

3224
02:19:31,640 --> 02:19:33,290
I love doing that.
And he loves it.

3225
02:19:33,380 --> 02:19:34,250
Oh,
he loves it.

3226
02:19:34,251 --> 02:19:36,560
He gets so excited.
He hates going to my truck.

3227
02:19:36,710 --> 02:19:40,820
But he'll go up to the truck like he
knows and then Mike come on in.

3228
02:19:40,821 --> 02:19:42,560
He won't hop in himself,
but I'll pick them up.

3229
02:19:42,561 --> 02:19:45,140
Like he knows he's going to have a good
time once he gets in there.

3230
02:19:45,160 --> 02:19:46,610
Yeah.
How long is the ride?

3231
02:19:47,080 --> 02:19:48,320
Uh,
just a few minutes.

3232
02:19:48,321 --> 02:19:51,560
It's not that bad.
Does he throw up?

3233
02:19:51,561 --> 02:19:52,820
If it's longer it,
he'll,

3234
02:19:52,821 --> 02:19:56,410
I've taken him on a 20 minute ride
before and eventually it'll chuck he's,

3235
02:19:56,460 --> 02:19:58,040
he gets,
he gets car sick.

3236
02:19:58,280 --> 02:20:02,750
Did you see that picture of somebody's
tape took a selfie while their dog was

3237
02:20:02,751 --> 02:20:04,910
throwing up?
Holy Shit.

3238
02:20:05,040 --> 02:20:05,873
Business.
Funny

3239
02:20:08,450 --> 02:20:09,710
Golden retrievers though,
man.

3240
02:20:09,711 --> 02:20:11,510
He's the first golden retriever I've
had.

3241
02:20:11,870 --> 02:20:16,870
They are lovely dogs there are so sweet.
They're just like bundles of affection

3242
02:20:18,561 --> 02:20:20,660
and happiness and he's smart man.

3243
02:20:20,810 --> 02:20:21,950
Yeah.
Like he's,

3244
02:20:22,010 --> 02:20:25,610
he's really easy to train.
He wants you to like him.

3245
02:20:25,611 --> 02:20:29,150
He wants you to be happy.
And so like when he finds the things

3246
02:20:29,151 --> 02:20:31,250
that you will be happy about,
he,

3247
02:20:31,310 --> 02:20:32,143
he,
you know,

3248
02:20:32,420 --> 02:20:34,280
he gravitates towards those.
Yeah.

3249
02:20:34,610 --> 02:20:36,260
That's,
hold on.

3250
02:20:36,440 --> 02:20:37,730
There's such good dogs,
man.

3251
02:20:38,330 --> 02:20:39,890
I mean,
I've had a bunch of different kinds of

3252
02:20:39,891 --> 02:20:44,750
dogs in my life and I'm a big dog fan,
but I'm just particularly impressed with

3253
02:20:44,751 --> 02:20:46,700
golden retrievers.
Just so nice.

3254
02:20:47,540 --> 02:20:50,120
And he's so great with my kids too.
That's the other thing.

3255
02:20:50,390 --> 02:20:52,640
He just a big,
big love.

3256
02:20:52,650 --> 02:20:54,410
But my dog,
we've got Jamie.

3257
02:20:55,820 --> 02:20:58,590
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

3258
02:20:58,591 --> 02:21:00,770
That picture is hilarious.
She caught the dog.

3259
02:21:00,771 --> 02:21:04,160
Maybe made her God damn hard.
Oh my God,

3260
02:21:04,190 --> 02:21:07,400
my dog threw up while I was taking a
selfie.

3261
02:21:09,080 --> 02:21:12,020
The Gal's name.
It's not,

3262
02:21:12,500 --> 02:21:15,320
uh Oh,
okay.

3263
02:21:15,590 --> 02:21:16,860
A repost.
Yeah.

3264
02:21:17,180 --> 02:21:17,870
Oh,
there's a few.

3265
02:21:17,870 --> 02:21:19,730
Is it,
what does it say up there?

3266
02:21:19,820 --> 02:21:24,820
Lie like a light l y kke underscore L.
I uh,

3267
02:21:25,880 --> 02:21:28,760
that's a fucking hilarious meme.
God Damn it.

3268
02:21:28,761 --> 02:21:32,360
That made me laugh.
So that is pretty fucking funny.

3269
02:21:32,540 --> 02:21:33,690
Um,
what kind of dog yet?

3270
02:21:34,160 --> 02:21:35,360
Pitbull.
Oh,

3271
02:21:35,361 --> 02:21:36,930
there was another thing when,
you know what else helps

3272
02:21:37,120 --> 02:21:39,580
with negative thoughts is a thing called
a murder.

3273
02:21:40,980 --> 02:21:42,130
Uh,

3274
02:21:42,500 --> 02:21:43,670
he kills homeless people for you.

3275
02:21:44,960 --> 02:21:48,080
Cognitive behavioral therapy.
Um,

3276
02:21:48,170 --> 02:21:50,360
and it was basically like,
it's

3277
02:21:52,340 --> 02:21:53,480
this,
this made me laugh.

3278
02:21:53,540 --> 02:21:55,430
Like it,
it's so dead on.

3279
02:21:55,460 --> 02:21:58,940
They just have think it's cool.
Just an unhelpful thinking styles.

3280
02:21:59,530 --> 02:21:59,991
Uh,
Jimmy,

3281
02:21:59,991 --> 02:22:01,970
you can bring this up to actually,
uh,

3282
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:06,810
there's a chart.
One of them is all or nothing thinking a

3283
02:22:06,830 --> 02:22:08,630
or black and white thinking something
like,

3284
02:22:08,631 --> 02:22:10,460
if I'm not perfect,
I've failed.

3285
02:22:11,030 --> 02:22:14,390
Either I do it right or not at all.
Just like dumb shit.

3286
02:22:14,391 --> 02:22:16,670
So anytime I think these things,
there's going to know you're

3287
02:22:16,671 --> 02:22:18,650
disqualified.
Like you gotta go.

3288
02:22:18,880 --> 02:22:21,530
Okay.
A mental filter only paying attention to

3289
02:22:21,531 --> 02:22:23,900
certain types of evidence.
Uh,

3290
02:22:23,901 --> 02:22:27,150
noticing our failures,
but not seeing our successes.

3291
02:22:27,840 --> 02:22:30,330
Jumping to conclusions.
Yeah.

3292
02:22:32,150 --> 02:22:37,040
Um,
hmm.

3293
02:22:37,590 --> 02:22:41,490
Thinking over generalizing everything
always rubbish.

3294
02:22:41,520 --> 02:22:44,460
No comedy ever happens.
A lot of these are literally just like

3295
02:22:45,450 --> 02:22:46,740
comedy.
How do you make comedy?

3296
02:22:46,741 --> 02:22:48,720
Yeah.
You have to exaggerate jumped to

3297
02:22:48,721 --> 02:22:52,620
conclusions yet,
but they're re they can be really

3298
02:22:52,621 --> 02:22:56,340
destructive on a personal level.
You know what I mean?

3299
02:22:56,370 --> 02:22:57,420
Oh yeah.
For sure.

3300
02:22:57,860 --> 02:22:58,250
But

3301
02:22:58,250 --> 02:23:02,150
I think everybody needs something
difficult to do on top of what they

3302
02:23:02,151 --> 02:23:04,970
already do.
This is my theory about standup comedy.

3303
02:23:05,490 --> 02:23:06,380
Uh,
one of the,

3304
02:23:06,410 --> 02:23:10,580
one of the ways that I've sort of
tighten up my game over the last few

3305
02:23:10,580 --> 02:23:13,430
years is to concentrate on difficult
things outside of comedy.

3306
02:23:13,930 --> 02:23:15,920
You know,
whether it's martial arts or whether

3307
02:23:15,921 --> 02:23:19,910
it's a yoga or bow hunting is another
one for me.

3308
02:23:20,150 --> 02:23:23,720
Doing things that are very difficult
makes comedy a little bit easier.

3309
02:23:24,040 --> 02:23:26,570
How come?
Because it's relatively easier.

3310
02:23:26,750 --> 02:23:28,520
Yeah.
Relatively easier.

3311
02:23:28,521 --> 02:23:31,520
But also you recognize like just didn't
do,

3312
02:23:31,521 --> 02:23:35,330
it doesn't seem like bow hunting and
standup comedy would ever go together,

3313
02:23:35,630 --> 02:23:40,010
but the way they go together as,
as an absolute reality in bow hunting

3314
02:23:40,040 --> 02:23:44,000
and it's fucking really difficult to do.
And in doing that,

3315
02:23:44,030 --> 02:23:47,150
it just helps you manage the
difficulties of standup better.

3316
02:23:47,680 --> 02:23:50,750
The same thing with Jujitsu.
I felt like Jujitsu helped me a lot with

3317
02:23:50,751 --> 02:23:55,670
stand up and martial arts in general
because Jujitsu is so much more

3318
02:23:55,700 --> 02:23:59,870
difficult to do than comedy.
Like physically difficult.

3319
02:23:59,871 --> 02:24:02,960
Like as you're doing it,
you're groaning and strengthen and,

3320
02:24:03,020 --> 02:24:08,020
and straining and just barely,
barely surviving certain situations and

3321
02:24:08,420 --> 02:24:11,450
getting into positions where people are
literally squeezing your fucking neck

3322
02:24:11,451 --> 02:24:12,900
and hear about to blackout.
Yeah.

3323
02:24:12,990 --> 02:24:17,990
And it just makes the uncomfortable
feeling of anticipation of standup.

3324
02:24:18,180 --> 02:24:22,370
It just makes it less dangerous.
Like less scary.

3325
02:24:22,640 --> 02:24:26,270
I did a show last night at the Fonda,
so it's like,

3326
02:24:26,271 --> 02:24:29,180
uh,
you know me theater,

3327
02:24:29,240 --> 02:24:30,500
so to speak,
audience probably,

3328
02:24:31,160 --> 02:24:32,420
I don't know,
800 people or something.

3329
02:24:33,080 --> 02:24:37,280
And by Dennis spot on Tuesday night
length.

3330
02:24:37,281 --> 02:24:39,410
Right.
I've done spots every night for the last

3331
02:24:39,411 --> 02:24:44,411
10 years in some degree of decent and
the thoughts I was having before I went

3332
02:24:45,201 --> 02:24:47,600
on like,
like,

3333
02:24:47,630 --> 02:24:49,100
no,
you're going to throw up on her,

3334
02:24:49,460 --> 02:24:53,360
like you're going to have a bad back
throw up on yourself.

3335
02:24:53,361 --> 02:24:54,680
And then I'm on stage.
I'm like,

3336
02:24:54,950 --> 02:24:57,080
why did you think that was going to
happen?

3337
02:24:57,440 --> 02:24:59,240
Fucking Weirdo.
I'm like,

3338
02:24:59,241 --> 02:25:03,080
none of it even came close to happening,
but your brain's just like,

3339
02:25:03,090 --> 02:25:03,270
no,
no,

3340
02:25:03,270 --> 02:25:04,140
no.
He got to,

3341
02:25:04,700 --> 02:25:06,920
this is going to like this worst case
scenario.

3342
02:25:06,921 --> 02:25:10,180
Shit that's so impractical.
The other thing that,

3343
02:25:10,181 --> 02:25:11,840
you know what's great and horrible at
Santa,

3344
02:25:11,841 --> 02:25:13,940
but somebody was saying like,
uh,

3345
02:25:14,120 --> 02:25:16,250
yeah,
you can't compare your spot.

3346
02:25:16,310 --> 02:25:18,080
You're set somebody else's and it's
like,

3347
02:25:19,830 --> 02:25:23,020
I can't not,
I heard the lapsed they got right.

3348
02:25:23,210 --> 02:25:24,070
Yeah,
I want

3349
02:25:24,070 --> 02:25:26,680
to get those labs or better.
Yeah.

3350
02:25:26,740 --> 02:25:29,130
Or you definitely can have some bombs.
Yeah.

3351
02:25:29,200 --> 02:25:31,750
In the other's audience socks and you go
up there and they're great.

3352
02:25:31,780 --> 02:25:32,610
Yeah.
Like,

3353
02:25:32,610 --> 02:25:33,130
yeah.
Yeah.

3354
02:25:33,130 --> 02:25:37,960
Like I have to compare like I can't,
like it's impossible not,

3355
02:25:37,990 --> 02:25:42,130
I can't act like it didn't,
businesses can't go like,

3356
02:25:42,131 --> 02:25:43,690
oh,
don't worry about that guy across the

3357
02:25:43,691 --> 02:25:46,420
street to know exact same business as a
theater.

3358
02:25:46,421 --> 02:25:48,550
Roosevelt comparison is the thief of
joy.

3359
02:25:48,580 --> 02:25:49,413
Yes.
Yeah.

3360
02:25:49,600 --> 02:25:53,740
Yeah.
But good luck following that shit.

3361
02:25:54,520 --> 02:25:57,070
Good luck following the,
I mean we all have to fucking,

3362
02:25:57,410 --> 02:26:00,000
you ever stick around just to see what
the next guy gets garbage.

3363
02:26:00,090 --> 02:26:01,390
Just see what,
uh,

3364
02:26:02,230 --> 02:26:04,510
I do,
but I tried to do it in a pure way.

3365
02:26:04,511 --> 02:26:08,300
I try to do it as a comedy fan.
Trying to still be a comedy fountain.

3366
02:26:08,710 --> 02:26:09,730
Yes.
I've done that.

3367
02:26:09,960 --> 02:26:11,200
I,
it's nine.

3368
02:26:11,550 --> 02:26:14,040
It's nine to one.
Like doing it as a fan,

3369
02:26:14,041 --> 02:26:15,520
like most of the time,
especially at the store.

3370
02:26:15,521 --> 02:26:18,910
Like I want to see the person on after
it's a stores,

3371
02:26:19,300 --> 02:26:21,760
oddly supportive.
Yeah.

3372
02:26:22,150 --> 02:26:23,020
Yeah,
yeah.

3373
02:26:23,021 --> 02:26:25,630
Cause I never feel like if I catch a bad
one,

3374
02:26:25,660 --> 02:26:28,990
I never feel judged by the guy I just
brought up.

3375
02:26:29,020 --> 02:26:31,090
Well that's another thing about,
we were talking about this the other

3376
02:26:31,091 --> 02:26:33,250
day,
can you catch a bad one at the store?

3377
02:26:33,251 --> 02:26:35,980
And everybody sort of wants to like
commiserate with you.

3378
02:26:35,981 --> 02:26:36,791
Like,
oh dude,

3379
02:26:36,791 --> 02:26:38,820
last week I couldn't get a laugh to say
my fucking life.

3380
02:26:39,280 --> 02:26:43,180
And everybody wants to,
it's not like everyone knows like the

3381
02:26:43,181 --> 02:26:48,070
level of comedy there is so high that
everyone knows that everyone's legit.

3382
02:26:48,280 --> 02:26:49,870
Yeah.
So it's like not like,

3383
02:26:49,890 --> 02:26:52,390
oh neal Brennan's losing it.
Like all right,

3384
02:26:52,391 --> 02:26:54,160
he's trying not to miss the shuck and
bum.

3385
02:26:54,460 --> 02:26:56,200
Yeah,
he's a fucking,

3386
02:26:56,380 --> 02:26:58,150
it was his turn.
Yeah.

3387
02:26:58,630 --> 02:27:02,950
And there are just moments followed Erik
Griffin probably a month ago and he

3388
02:27:02,951 --> 02:27:05,020
caught a bad one and I went,
uh,

3389
02:27:05,050 --> 02:27:08,710
Erik Griffin,
one of the worst spots he's had and a

3390
02:27:08,710 --> 02:27:11,680
couple of months.
It's fucking,

3391
02:27:12,160 --> 02:27:14,860
they laugh.
We all just like,

3392
02:27:14,861 --> 02:27:18,460
yeah,
I had that was made three days ago down.

3393
02:27:18,461 --> 02:27:20,200
Sometimes it's no,
not pretty,

3394
02:27:20,660 --> 02:27:22,180
and it,
no one is immune,

3395
02:27:22,660 --> 02:27:26,920
especially in the or the or the original
room.

3396
02:27:26,921 --> 02:27:30,640
That room we'll fucking slap you in the
face with reality.

3397
02:27:30,700 --> 02:27:34,480
Like no other room in the country,
although I have more bad sits in the

3398
02:27:34,481 --> 02:27:36,120
main room that I do in the Olr.
Do you?

3399
02:27:36,220 --> 02:27:37,630
Yeah.
Because,

3400
02:27:39,340 --> 02:27:42,010
uh,
I don't,

3401
02:27:42,970 --> 02:27:44,530
I don't,
I don't even really know.

3402
02:27:44,531 --> 02:27:47,830
I feel like the main,
the or like suits me better because I

3403
02:27:47,831 --> 02:27:49,820
don't have to be like gregarious and did
it,

3404
02:27:49,821 --> 02:27:52,030
it you can just be like fucking,
you can be,

3405
02:27:52,090 --> 02:27:53,320
you can creep.
Yeah.

3406
02:27:53,321 --> 02:27:58,000
You can be a dark creep
and you can be a dark creep in that or

3407
02:27:58,070 --> 02:27:59,110
yeah.
But it's,

3408
02:27:59,111 --> 02:28:00,520
uh,
it's also think,

3409
02:28:00,550 --> 02:28:05,550
I think it's incredibly valuable to have
that many high level comics around you

3410
02:28:05,711 --> 02:28:06,780
all the time.
Yeah.

3411
02:28:07,010 --> 02:28:11,800
See that level and be inspired and like,
oh Jesus,

3412
02:28:11,801 --> 02:28:12,880
that's a good joke.
They're like,

3413
02:28:12,910 --> 02:28:15,190
fuck it and what not even fuck,
why didn't I think of it?

3414
02:28:15,191 --> 02:28:16,240
I'm jealous.
Just like,

3415
02:28:17,290 --> 02:28:19,100
you know,
it's a good first.

3416
02:28:19,240 --> 02:28:20,320
Nailed it.
They nailed it.

3417
02:28:20,410 --> 02:28:21,950
They give it to him.

3418
02:28:21,980 --> 02:28:24,830
That's a fair fair.
And he did it fair and square.

3419
02:28:24,860 --> 02:28:28,520
The only time I don't feel those like
God fucking now that,

3420
02:28:28,521 --> 02:28:30,800
why didn't I think of that?
The only time I don't think like that is

3421
02:28:30,801 --> 02:28:33,920
what I'm doing enough writing when I'm
doing plenty of writing.

3422
02:28:33,921 --> 02:28:37,490
Those creepy like jealousy thoughts
don't get in there.

3423
02:28:37,550 --> 02:28:38,330
Yeah.
We're the,

3424
02:28:38,330 --> 02:28:41,000
you know,
the whimsical a co could have been me if

3425
02:28:41,001 --> 02:28:43,010
I just got there first.
And it isn't,

3426
02:28:43,190 --> 02:28:46,700
it is that,
it is golf in that it's as much as you

3427
02:28:46,701 --> 02:28:47,570
can here.

3428
02:28:48,410 --> 02:28:52,640
The guy in front of you
sink a long Putt,

3429
02:28:54,210 --> 02:28:57,010
you still got it's you against you.
It's still like,

3430
02:28:57,030 --> 02:28:59,250
oh,
for sure doesn't mean because you

3431
02:28:59,251 --> 02:29:01,890
killed.
Doesn't mean I can't write of course.

3432
02:29:02,460 --> 02:29:05,550
But if you think you can't,
it does mean you can't.

3433
02:29:05,940 --> 02:29:06,780
Yes.
Oh,

3434
02:29:06,781 --> 02:29:09,950
I know.
I can tell you a hour before my set how

3435
02:29:09,951 --> 02:29:11,760
I'm going to do,
I'm not even kidding.

3436
02:29:11,761 --> 02:29:12,430
I can just tell

3437
02:29:12,430 --> 02:29:14,050
by my,
like my,

3438
02:29:14,051 --> 02:29:15,640
uh,
my serotonin level.

3439
02:29:16,570 --> 02:29:18,280
Do you ever try to break yourself out of
it?

3440
02:29:18,720 --> 02:29:19,950
Yes.
They're,

3441
02:29:20,020 --> 02:29:23,140
the positive visualization is good.
And,

3442
02:29:23,141 --> 02:29:25,840
uh,
and just like taking a moment and like

3443
02:29:25,841 --> 02:29:29,980
trying to get some serotonin going and
like feel,

3444
02:29:30,010 --> 02:29:31,060
just try to feel good

3445
02:29:31,270 --> 02:29:33,700
for me.
I moved my body around like bounce

3446
02:29:33,701 --> 02:29:38,020
around and place like a jump around.
Like I'll stretch and just get

3447
02:29:38,021 --> 02:29:39,970
everything moving my head.
Yeah,

3448
02:29:39,971 --> 02:29:43,240
I've done that still shadowboxing.
Just shuffle my feet,

3449
02:29:43,450 --> 02:29:46,490
cause get my blood pumping and get
everything accelerating.

3450
02:29:46,710 --> 02:29:50,730
Another thing that no one judges,
no one goes like the fuck is Rogan.

3451
02:29:50,731 --> 02:29:52,620
Do you know what I mean?
Like no one at the store would be like,

3452
02:29:53,070 --> 02:29:56,670
we all just like,
I've been in conversations with people.

3453
02:29:56,671 --> 02:29:57,421
If someone goes,
hey,

3454
02:29:57,421 --> 02:29:58,290
I gotta get ready.
I'm not,

3455
02:29:58,520 --> 02:30:01,790
yeah bro.
Can't just walk up there man.

3456
02:30:01,791 --> 02:30:03,770
Bro.
One Time Joey Diaz yelled at me for

3457
02:30:03,771 --> 02:30:07,720
having a notebook.
You know,

3458
02:30:07,890 --> 02:30:10,790
Joey's just get that weird thing like
every now and then like what are you

3459
02:30:10,791 --> 02:30:12,890
doing with fucking ketchup and fries?
Fries,

3460
02:30:12,891 --> 02:30:15,560
taste great on the road.
You don't need no fucking ketchup.

3461
02:30:15,740 --> 02:30:18,700
Like every now and then he'd just get
crazy with some like absolute.

3462
02:30:18,990 --> 02:30:21,470
And I had a notebook and he goes,
what the fuck he doing with that

3463
02:30:21,471 --> 02:30:22,191
notebook?
I go,

3464
02:30:22,191 --> 02:30:23,450
I'm working on some new shit.
He goes,

3465
02:30:23,690 --> 02:30:25,210
you're carrying around that fucking
notebook.

3466
02:30:25,220 --> 02:30:28,790
Like those other memos that just want
you to know that they're fucking

3467
02:30:28,810 --> 02:30:30,320
writing.
I know.

3468
02:30:30,321 --> 02:30:31,090
Book.
Yeah.

3469
02:30:31,090 --> 02:30:34,210
Get the fuck Outta here with notebooks
and notebooks,

3470
02:30:34,220 --> 02:30:34,790
Joe.
Yeah.

3471
02:30:34,790 --> 02:30:36,020
Joey,
is that where it is now?

3472
02:30:36,170 --> 02:30:40,670
This is important.
I remember shit literally calf to

3473
02:30:40,671 --> 02:30:41,480
remember.
Shit.

3474
02:30:41,480 --> 02:30:43,040
I have all these new punchlines.
I have to,

3475
02:30:43,041 --> 02:30:44,460
I don't want to fuck this up.
Yeah.

3476
02:30:44,660 --> 02:30:45,830
You know,
what the fuck are you doing?

3477
02:30:45,980 --> 02:30:49,170
Come on dog.
The fucking notebook out of here that I

3478
02:30:49,180 --> 02:30:50,480
can talk about.
Uh,

3479
02:30:50,510 --> 02:30:53,930
talk about hearing what the guy in front
of you gets.

3480
02:30:54,070 --> 02:30:55,580
You can't following him.
It's just like,

3481
02:30:59,030 --> 02:31:01,610
okay,
you guys want some fucking thoughtful

3482
02:31:01,611 --> 02:31:03,040
notions.
Uh,

3483
02:31:03,080 --> 02:31:03,650
that's how I

3484
02:31:03,650 --> 02:31:05,780
phil after him,
I feel like I might as well go up as

3485
02:31:05,781 --> 02:31:08,330
like a fucking professor.
There's,

3486
02:31:08,331 --> 02:31:12,110
we'll have like a briefcase,
like good evening class.

3487
02:31:12,570 --> 02:31:13,950
Well,
that's one of the reasons why I started

3488
02:31:13,951 --> 02:31:16,740
taking joey on the road with me just
cause I was scared to follow him.

3489
02:31:17,010 --> 02:31:19,860
Yeah.
I know also wanted the best I could work

3490
02:31:19,861 --> 02:31:20,090
with.

3491
02:31:20,090 --> 02:31:20,740
Yeah.
And I was like,

3492
02:31:20,740 --> 02:31:23,400
I've had people come out to see me.
I don't want to be the only one.

3493
02:31:23,401 --> 02:31:24,121
Funny.
I want to,

3494
02:31:24,121 --> 02:31:28,020
I want everybody else to be funny too is
I'd bring the best guys I could and I

3495
02:31:28,021 --> 02:31:31,530
realized that that you just gotta be
able to ride the wave of Joe.

3496
02:31:31,890 --> 02:31:34,050
That's the,
that it's like that with anybody.

3497
02:31:34,250 --> 02:31:36,300
The avant had to follow Chappelle the
other night and he was like,

3498
02:31:36,301 --> 02:31:36,900
I didn't,
I,

3499
02:31:36,900 --> 02:31:38,190
I was like scared.
And I was like,

3500
02:31:38,191 --> 02:31:40,020
yeah,
you don't be there.

3501
02:31:40,080 --> 02:31:44,400
So gacked from seeing somebody that
famous that they're like,

3502
02:31:44,460 --> 02:31:47,130
they just don't fuck with it.
Yeah.

3503
02:31:47,160 --> 02:31:49,210
If you're comfortable,
you could ride the way.

3504
02:31:49,211 --> 02:31:51,150
But if you are insecure because Oh my
God,

3505
02:31:51,151 --> 02:31:53,760
I just go,
I'm going after Joey Diaz Shit and that

3506
02:31:53,761 --> 02:31:58,080
nervousness and that feeling.
I took joy in the road of me once in New

3507
02:31:58,080 --> 02:32:00,930
Jersey and I bombed.
It was like the last time I bombed going

3508
02:32:00,931 --> 02:32:05,280
on after Joey and uh,
he went up and fucking murdered and he

3509
02:32:05,281 --> 02:32:07,440
was fucking with the crowd.
Like I forget what happened,

3510
02:32:07,620 --> 02:32:10,350
but I remember that feeling as I was
going up to the stage,

3511
02:32:10,351 --> 02:32:13,740
like this is not going to be good.
I don't want to have all given me.

3512
02:32:14,350 --> 02:32:19,350
And it was a transitionary period in my
act where I was like not quite can have

3513
02:32:19,681 --> 02:32:21,550
the bits down yet.
It's still working.

3514
02:32:21,900 --> 02:32:23,640
[inaudible]

3515
02:32:24,030 --> 02:32:27,030
Yup.
But that's one of the reasons why I used

3516
02:32:27,031 --> 02:32:29,070
to love taking them with,
I can't anymore because it's too

3517
02:32:29,071 --> 02:32:30,930
successful.
But I would still love,

3518
02:32:31,200 --> 02:32:35,140
that's a rock rock does that rock.
If rocks done a weekend when he first

3519
02:32:35,141 --> 02:32:36,090
had his new hour,
he,

3520
02:32:36,220 --> 02:32:37,240
he like,
he's like,

3521
02:32:37,241 --> 02:32:39,460
I gotta get earthquake out here man.
He's like,

3522
02:32:39,461 --> 02:32:43,780
I need good sparring partners.
I need people that are like fucking,

3523
02:32:43,840 --> 02:32:45,220
I'm afraid to follow.
He's like,

3524
02:32:45,221 --> 02:32:50,010
I get earthquake and Leslie out here,
earthquake will murder our room.

3525
02:32:50,170 --> 02:32:51,730
Yeah,
you don't even know.

3526
02:32:52,240 --> 02:32:56,290
It's one of those things where he's
already murdered them when he gets out

3527
02:32:56,291 --> 02:33:01,150
for like it's all so for high level it's
insane.

3528
02:33:01,690 --> 02:33:04,030
He also had a thing,
his last special,

3529
02:33:04,510 --> 02:33:07,870
he fucked a joke up and kept it in.
Oh really?

3530
02:33:07,900 --> 02:33:09,550
And it's like,
oh y'all never fucked up.

3531
02:33:09,610 --> 02:33:13,020
It's fucking really funny history.
Really.

3532
02:33:14,140 --> 02:33:19,010
That dude is fucked up a joke.
Uh,

3533
02:33:19,080 --> 02:33:20,540
like,
which is like a hag.

3534
02:33:20,590 --> 02:33:23,980
It's a hacky thing to say other than he,
the way he did it was so fucking,

3535
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:27,100
that's very smart of him to do that.
To bring those guys with them.

3536
02:33:27,400 --> 02:33:30,190
Yes.
Murder after murderer that's wise.

3537
02:33:30,280 --> 02:33:32,380
And then you have to fucking,
you have,

3538
02:33:32,410 --> 02:33:37,180
then you can't be like no.
Cause it's like I don't care about fame.

3539
02:33:37,181 --> 02:33:39,460
I don't,
I didn't know who that person was

3540
02:33:39,890 --> 02:33:44,510
and he's fucking hilarious.
Well that in is not just about comedy

3541
02:33:44,540 --> 02:33:48,020
and I think that relates to a lot of the
problems that a lot of people have in

3542
02:33:48,021 --> 02:33:51,470
life with what you would call haters.
Like with a lot of haters are,

3543
02:33:51,710 --> 02:33:54,830
as they see people that are doing way
better than them,

3544
02:33:55,010 --> 02:33:57,740
they see things that are happening and
there's some things legitimately to

3545
02:33:57,741 --> 02:33:58,650
hate.
Right.

3546
02:33:58,980 --> 02:34:02,750
But then there's a lot of haters that
are haters about athletes or about

3547
02:34:03,230 --> 02:34:07,350
singers or rappers or whatever.
A lot of it is just jealousy and the

3548
02:34:07,440 --> 02:34:09,410
that jealousy is,
they look at themselves,

3549
02:34:09,411 --> 02:34:11,750
they look at that person,
they don't like the way they measure up.

3550
02:34:11,751 --> 02:34:16,400
And so all they can concentrate on is
trying to find something wrong with that

3551
02:34:16,401 --> 02:34:17,770
person.
Like try

3552
02:34:18,050 --> 02:34:21,760
and not being instead inspired.
Yeah.

3553
02:34:21,790 --> 02:34:26,080
You know,
and like being inspired is so much more

3554
02:34:26,081 --> 02:34:29,470
beneficial to you.
It's so much healthier and it's so much

3555
02:34:29,471 --> 02:34:31,510
more of a strong move.
Yeah.

3556
02:34:31,870 --> 02:34:34,930
It doesn't,
you're not having,

3557
02:34:35,290 --> 02:34:37,220
I think a lot of times with this like
Harvard,

3558
02:34:37,221 --> 02:34:39,250
then it goes to that power thing.
I think some guys,

3559
02:34:39,580 --> 02:34:44,580
sometimes guys especially we'll see that
see their career is revenge.

3560
02:34:46,480 --> 02:34:49,060
Oh yeah.
I think there is a little,

3561
02:34:49,180 --> 02:34:51,760
a little bit of that is worthwhile,
but I don't,

3562
02:34:51,820 --> 02:34:55,300
I think it can poison a fucking chore.
Poison you if you're,

3563
02:34:55,540 --> 02:34:58,090
if you're consumed by it.
Cause there's guys that we all know that

3564
02:34:58,091 --> 02:35:00,220
are just like,
all they do is like,

3565
02:35:00,221 --> 02:35:02,290
just see what so and so got and you're
like,

3566
02:35:02,291 --> 02:35:04,300
yeah,
those guys are useless.

3567
02:35:04,360 --> 02:35:05,290
Yeah.
It again,

3568
02:35:05,320 --> 02:35:08,490
he's not,
it wasn't between you and him and the

3569
02:35:08,491 --> 02:35:13,491
taints their work to that mindset that
that limited growth mindset that fucks

3570
02:35:14,261 --> 02:35:15,220
with their work.

3571
02:35:15,340 --> 02:35:19,210
Yeah.
Trying to be original and as good as you

3572
02:35:19,211 --> 02:35:21,520
pause somebody was the other night was
complaining like,

3573
02:35:21,970 --> 02:35:23,200
yeah,
my agent didn't.

3574
02:35:23,440 --> 02:35:25,540
He moved and he did.
They didn't tell me and I was like,

3575
02:35:25,541 --> 02:35:28,810
dude,
every job you ever get is going to be

3576
02:35:28,811 --> 02:35:31,720
from other comics.
It's every job,

3577
02:35:32,200 --> 02:35:36,130
every job I've ever gotten is from the
Boston comedy club,

3578
02:35:36,980 --> 02:35:41,950
comedy cellar and the store literally in
my entire career.

3579
02:35:42,310 --> 02:35:44,410
That's crazy.
I mean basically,

3580
02:35:44,770 --> 02:35:48,760
uh,
I was videotaping people for casting

3581
02:35:48,761 --> 02:35:53,761
director when it worked at the Boston,
got a job out here working for her then.

3582
02:35:54,130 --> 02:35:58,750
Then I started working for Niccolo that
we cast MTV singled out.

3583
02:35:58,780 --> 02:36:01,960
I got a writing job there.
Next door was nickelodeon.

3584
02:36:01,961 --> 02:36:04,870
All that started talking to them.
Got a job there.

3585
02:36:05,090 --> 02:36:05,831
Me and Chappelle,
right.

3586
02:36:05,831 --> 02:36:09,010
Half baked him I know from Boston.
Um,

3587
02:36:09,190 --> 02:36:14,190
then I write movies for a while,
then we do chappelle show still still

3588
02:36:15,101 --> 02:36:15,934
from Boston.

3589
02:36:16,630 --> 02:36:20,950
Uh,
and then then I'm like in Showbiz and

3590
02:36:20,980 --> 02:36:25,980
it's all like a direct,
it's all the direct current from that.

3591
02:36:26,970 --> 02:36:29,680
Every commercial I direct commercials,
it's all from,

3592
02:36:30,070 --> 02:36:32,410
that's from Chappelle show cause it's
like a long story.

3593
02:36:32,411 --> 02:36:36,220
But like the Air Jordan,
I did things with them and then they

3594
02:36:36,221 --> 02:36:37,300
were like,
you should do more commercial.

3595
02:36:37,301 --> 02:36:41,800
So I do commercial and it's like,
it's all from your peers.

3596
02:36:41,920 --> 02:36:43,390
Right.
It's literally offering me periods.

3597
02:36:43,391 --> 02:36:45,180
That's it.
That's the only people that are gaining

3598
02:36:45,181 --> 02:36:47,770
get you that they're the people that are
going to hire you.

3599
02:36:48,050 --> 02:36:50,770
Some people don't like to think that way
because I think there's like this

3600
02:36:50,771 --> 02:36:54,700
embedded mindset that used to exist when
there was a limited number of jobs.

3601
02:36:54,730 --> 02:36:56,920
Yeah.
And there was like only two guys could,

3602
02:36:56,921 --> 02:36:57,730
uh,
you know,

3603
02:36:57,730 --> 02:37:01,600
one guy is going to be a competing
against someone else for the tonight

3604
02:37:01,601 --> 02:37:02,980
show.
Only one guy's going to get it.

3605
02:37:03,050 --> 02:37:04,870
You know,
that's not the case anymore.

3606
02:37:05,080 --> 02:37:07,210
There's so much above others.
By the way,

3607
02:37:07,211 --> 02:37:09,790
there's too much almost,
I mean there's,

3608
02:37:09,820 --> 02:37:13,820
it's too much to keep up with like just
all the Netflix special,

3609
02:37:13,830 --> 02:37:16,010
can't watch all this shit.
Like I truly

3610
02:37:16,010 --> 02:37:17,540
don't have time.
I don't know how people do it.

3611
02:37:18,110 --> 02:37:19,810
Um,
but like the,

3612
02:37:19,880 --> 02:37:23,300
that's what it comes down to.
It's like it's not being competitive

3613
02:37:23,301 --> 02:37:26,720
with people and supporting people and
being inspired by the people that are

3614
02:37:26,721 --> 02:37:28,900
really good fuel.
Yeah.

3615
02:37:28,920 --> 02:37:31,900
Like I was telling somebody,
it's a long shot,

3616
02:37:31,901 --> 02:37:34,780
but a girl,
I knew a girl I know who is,

3617
02:37:35,140 --> 02:37:40,140
is a producer at a TV show and she
hadn't watched my netflix special and

3618
02:37:40,220 --> 02:37:41,300
I'm like,
we're friends.

3619
02:37:41,630 --> 02:37:43,430
And I was like,
you're,

3620
02:37:43,460 --> 02:37:47,030
you're stupid for not watching it.
I go,

3621
02:37:47,031 --> 02:37:48,800
hey,
it's insulting to me.

3622
02:37:48,830 --> 02:37:51,530
You're directly insulting me.
You're literally just hurting my

3623
02:37:51,531 --> 02:37:54,170
feelings going out of your way and I go,
and B,

3624
02:37:54,290 --> 02:37:58,100
you're in comedy.
It's a well-regarded thing.

3625
02:37:58,370 --> 02:38:00,710
Like just inform yourself.
I was like,

3626
02:38:01,040 --> 02:38:06,040
I saw Schumer do a joke nine years ago
that I really liked and just texted her

3627
02:38:08,601 --> 02:38:10,130
like it didn't really know her at all.

3628
02:38:10,340 --> 02:38:10,851
It was like,
Hey,

3629
02:38:10,851 --> 02:38:13,970
that looks fucking great.
And then she asked me to director show,

3630
02:38:14,420 --> 02:38:15,253
you know what I mean?
Like,

3631
02:38:15,290 --> 02:38:17,480
and I'm not,
I didn't do it to get her to do,

3632
02:38:17,481 --> 02:38:19,310
you know what I mean?
It's just this thing of just like,

3633
02:38:19,640 --> 02:38:21,500
yeah,
that's how you make relationships.

3634
02:38:21,501 --> 02:38:22,880
You just like,
I like that.

3635
02:38:22,881 --> 02:38:24,890
Some people don't like watches 10 up
though.

3636
02:38:25,010 --> 02:38:26,300
Like north,
that's what she said.

3637
02:38:26,301 --> 02:38:27,950
She's like,
I just don't like stand up.

3638
02:38:28,460 --> 02:38:29,293
And I was like,
okay.

3639
02:38:29,660 --> 02:38:30,450
I was like,
I go,

3640
02:38:30,450 --> 02:38:31,730
that's completely fair.
Well,

3641
02:38:31,731 --> 02:38:34,370
Norton likes it,
but he doesn't want to be influenced so

3642
02:38:34,371 --> 02:38:36,110
he doesn't watch any stand up.
That's fair.

3643
02:38:36,290 --> 02:38:37,700
Yeah.
This girl just doesn't,

3644
02:38:37,701 --> 02:38:39,710
she's like,
I just like scripted comedy better.

3645
02:38:39,950 --> 02:38:40,830
Whoa.
And I was like,

3646
02:38:40,860 --> 02:38:43,310
well,
she salt to do she answer bro.

3647
02:38:43,450 --> 02:38:46,250
Right to my face.
I can't believe it.

3648
02:38:46,640 --> 02:38:47,810
Hey,
I gotta go to the dentist,

3649
02:38:47,840 --> 02:38:48,980
go to the fucking dentist,
man.

3650
02:38:49,420 --> 02:38:50,330
Give you teeth.

3651
02:38:50,360 --> 02:38:51,081
Yeah.
So,

3652
02:38:51,081 --> 02:38:53,330
um,
come back after you do Ibogaine.

3653
02:38:53,420 --> 02:38:54,770
Oh,
cannot wait.

3654
02:38:55,100 --> 02:38:58,430
How long are you gonna be up there for?
Three or four days.

3655
02:38:58,550 --> 02:39:00,980
How many different treatments?
One treatment.

3656
02:39:00,981 --> 02:39:03,320
Yeah.
And the other days are just kick it.

3657
02:39:03,590 --> 02:39:07,250
Just one day is like you gotta like you
gotta write your questions.

3658
02:39:07,700 --> 02:39:09,110
Uh,
one day is like,

3659
02:39:09,350 --> 02:39:10,760

3660
02:39:10,761 --> 02:39:15,761

Wednesday and maybe 24 hour experience.

3661
02:39:15,891 --> 02:39:18,020
Right.
They say 24 to 36.

3662
02:39:18,290 --> 02:39:21,020
Ooh.
Uh,

3663
02:39:21,110 --> 02:39:24,410
which I'm really,
I watched a bunch of videos.

3664
02:39:24,440 --> 02:39:28,280
You know what's funny is so many,
if you go on youtube and just fucking

3665
02:39:28,281 --> 02:39:32,420
typing anything,
so much of it comes back to this,

3666
02:39:32,450 --> 02:39:34,160
to your show.
Oh No.

3667
02:39:34,161 --> 02:39:36,650
In a good way.
Like so and so talks about blank,

3668
02:39:37,130 --> 02:39:38,810
like if you,
especially drugs,

3669
02:39:39,300 --> 02:39:41,240
um,
like it's,

3670
02:39:41,270 --> 02:39:44,330
and there was a lot of,
it was a dude who you've had on here,

3671
02:39:44,540 --> 02:39:47,000
I can't remember his name,
but like Spencer's and I don't know.

3672
02:39:47,390 --> 02:39:48,380
Um,
but uh,

3673
02:39:48,440 --> 02:39:51,310
who had talked about doing Ibogaine and
have you done Iowaska?

3674
02:39:52,350 --> 02:39:53,350
No,

3675
02:39:53,690 --> 02:39:55,790

Yeah,

3676
02:39:56,030 --> 02:39:58,430
I've done a done mushrooms,
done acid.

3677
02:39:58,970 --> 02:40:00,950
Never done a number down.
I began,

3678
02:40:01,250 --> 02:40:02,540
but I,
I've always associated,

3679
02:40:02,541 --> 02:40:06,450
I began with being a one that people use
to cure the patients.

3680
02:40:06,500 --> 02:40:07,550
For sure.
Yeah.

3681
02:40:07,850 --> 02:40:11,780
Um,
I'm addicted to the game game son.

3682
02:40:12,490 --> 02:40:14,070
I'm trying to get loose from this game.

3683
02:40:14,430 --> 02:40:17,130
Ladies and gentlemen,
the great and powerful Neil Brennan

3684
02:40:17,150 --> 02:40:17,911
time.
Joe,

3685
02:40:17,911 --> 02:40:22,070
until we meet again,
my friend didn't show your Ibogaine

3686
02:40:22,130 --> 02:40:25,080
ventures.
See you sooner than these gentlemen.

3687
02:40:28,980 --> 02:40:29,280
That was great.
