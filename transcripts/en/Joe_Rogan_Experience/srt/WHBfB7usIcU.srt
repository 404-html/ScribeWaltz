1
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,380
Zealot. Yeah. Did you start, did you
launch that was the mail. Guess what?

2
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:17,270
No sponsors. Just fucking cue the music
and it give you a dollar at least. Yes.

3
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,810
Give me a book. All right, cool. Hit it.

4
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:25,860
Experience you podcast my night.
All Day.

5
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:30,080
Yeah, we have music. It's ridiculous,

6
00:00:30,081 --> 00:00:34,040
but it makes me feel like
something's actually happening.
[inaudible] Sam Harris.

7
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:36,200
Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for
joining me, man. This is really cool.

8
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:38,990
It's an excellent opportunity.
The internets or a buzz.

9
00:00:38,991 --> 00:00:43,850
I've gotten more response for this as far
as like questions for you then I think

10
00:00:43,851 --> 00:00:46,430
any, any guests we've ever had.
Great. Well I'm very happy to be here.

11
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm happy here too, man. I've
watched a lot of your videos online.

12
00:00:50,001 --> 00:00:53,780
I've enjoyed every one of them and I like
in some of those debates that you get

13
00:00:53,781 --> 00:00:56,630
into with those old
Gracie in action videos.

14
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,000
Have you ever seen those
old Gracie in action videos?

15
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:01,730
I'm not entirely sure though.
I know the ones you're talking about.

16
00:01:01,731 --> 00:01:03,650
I've seen a lot of Gracie material.
Yeah,

17
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:07,190
well the Gracie in action videos were
really the first videos that Horian Gracie

18
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:11,600
Horian. Gracie, a WHO's a hit,
Leo's son, voices brothers,

19
00:01:11,601 --> 00:01:12,950
a brilliant businessman,

20
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:17,180
and he realized that all he needed to do
was put together a series of real life

21
00:01:17,181 --> 00:01:21,800
encounters between a train
Jujitsu practitioner and
some guy who thinks he knows

22
00:01:21,801 --> 00:01:22,650
how to fight.
He's,

23
00:01:22,651 --> 00:01:26,240
he's sure he knows how to fight and
then he just gets mangled every time,

24
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:29,100
every single foot. This wasn't
the Gracie challenge at all? Well,

25
00:01:29,101 --> 00:01:29,950
they've got a bunch of them.

26
00:01:29,951 --> 00:01:33,410
I mean there's Gracies Gracie and
action one and two. There's essentially,

27
00:01:33,411 --> 00:01:34,040
it's just,
it's,

28
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:39,040
it's basically just compilations of
home videos that they have of really for

29
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:42,320
martial artists, really brilliant
stuff to watch because you know,

30
00:01:42,321 --> 00:01:43,910
until the Gracies came along,

31
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,580
nobody really knew that there was one
guy out there that could just sort of

32
00:01:46,581 --> 00:01:49,050
manhandle people like that and
just strangle them and children.

33
00:01:49,051 --> 00:01:52,310
If there was one martial art that was
so superior when it came to grappling

34
00:01:52,311 --> 00:01:55,910
situation that you would watch those
and you'd almost feel bad for the guy

35
00:01:55,911 --> 00:01:57,260
getting strangled,
but not really.

36
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:01,760
That's how I feel when I watch a lot
of your debates. That's very high

37
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:02,190
praise.

38
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:06,310
I can tell you it's not as satisfying
in a debate format as it is on the mat.

39
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,300
Oh I'm sure cause it cause no
one ever taps. It's like you're,

40
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:11,020
it's like you're fighting,
you know,

41
00:02:11,021 --> 00:02:14,010
an army of zombies that
they've lost but they, they,

42
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:16,030
they can't be forced to
admit that they've lost

43
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:16,830
it.

44
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:21,060
Says it's must be a very bizarre thing
for you because as far as like people who

45
00:02:21,061 --> 00:02:25,590
have spent like hours and hours debating
publicly debating the merits or the

46
00:02:25,591 --> 00:02:30,440
idea of religion, you might be like, you
know, like top 10 on youtube of all the,

47
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:32,220
the, the different
information that's available.

48
00:02:32,221 --> 00:02:36,090
Have you ever seen anybody in all these
different debates you've been where you,

49
00:02:36,091 --> 00:02:38,670
you've knocked something into their
head and you see like a light go off.

50
00:02:38,671 --> 00:02:42,810
Like Holy Shit, what if you,
right. Do you ever get that?

51
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,420
Well it's hard to see in real time.

52
00:02:45,421 --> 00:02:49,470
People are pretty good about not having
epiphany's in real time in front of you.

53
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,820
You know, so, so yeah,

54
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:54,510
you can see people get uncomfortable and
you can see them want to make a lateral

55
00:02:54,511 --> 00:02:58,330
move to a new subject. Cause there's,
there's a lot of, uh, I mean,

56
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,740
one of the great strategies or,
or the one of the,

57
00:03:00,741 --> 00:03:04,510
the less noble but effective
strategies of debate is too,

58
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:08,050
if you've lost a point, you just
don't, you don't concede it,

59
00:03:08,051 --> 00:03:11,710
you just kind of move on to something
else and hope no one notices. And if,

60
00:03:11,711 --> 00:03:14,650
and in, in a formal debate, a format,

61
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,280
there's often no mechanism by which to
sort of for your opponent to score that

62
00:03:20,561 --> 00:03:22,660
as,
as conquered ground because you like,

63
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:24,690
you can't address each
other in real time. So, so,

64
00:03:24,691 --> 00:03:27,760
so it's like I talked for 10 minutes,
someone else talks for 10 minutes.

65
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:31,570
The moderator doesn't
necessarily interrupt us and we,

66
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:35,110
the two discussions can't
actually address one another.

67
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,360
So a formal debates are actually,
um,

68
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:43,170
ironically the kind of the worst
format to actually prove who's right,

69
00:03:43,931 --> 00:03:48,820
because it's like fighting someone, you
know, vert you're, so you're separated by,

70
00:03:48,821 --> 00:03:50,780
it's, it's like, it's like boxing, you
know, it's like the clinic, you get a,

71
00:03:50,781 --> 00:03:53,660
you get a clinch and the
ref separates you. Um,

72
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:58,570
and so you can't really test every tool,
uh,

73
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:02,030
in that context. And so, um,

74
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,620
you can just kind of talk past each
other and not address the thing that was

75
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:10,510
brought up 10 minutes ago and it never
really gets scored. So it's, it's, it's,

76
00:04:10,511 --> 00:04:11,344
um,

77
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:17,040
it's amazingly unsatisfying even when
you feel like you have said exactly what

78
00:04:17,081 --> 00:04:20,020
you should have said and you, because
they just won't buy it. It's just like,

79
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:24,540
just like fighting with fog, you know,
no one never, no one ever falls down and,

80
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:28,930
and it's occasionally you, you, you
score, you score below that, you know,

81
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:33,760
the audience has noticed. But even
then the audience is partitioned into,

82
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:38,770
you know, the, the, the, your side and
the other side. And it's amazing how, um,

83
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:43,450
in vulnerable people's prejudices
and biases are to two argument.

84
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,220
So it'd be an also becomes a team, you
know, become something that defines,

85
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:51,700
you know, a lot of people
are defined by their ideas,

86
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:54,790
especially when it comes to their
religion or their politics. You know,

87
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:57,040
they're defined by them to
the point where they like,

88
00:04:57,041 --> 00:05:00,580
act within certain parameters because
they think that's what you're supposed to

89
00:05:00,581 --> 00:05:04,540
do if you're on this team, people like
that. For somebody. I mean, it's a weird,

90
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:07,430
creepy desire that we
have to become part of a,

91
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,680
of a team and defend that team. And
I think that happens when, when,

92
00:05:11,681 --> 00:05:13,810
when it gets into religious arguments,
it's like you're,

93
00:05:13,811 --> 00:05:18,210
you're not just attacking an idea that
someone planted in their head and you're,

94
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:23,180
you're, you're attacking how they
define themselves. Yeah. It is. It's,

95
00:05:23,181 --> 00:05:26,890
it's people's extended identity.
I'm a windows user. Yeah.

96
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,700
It's like I'm, I'm a Christian, I'm
a Catholic. And it becomes, you know,

97
00:05:30,701 --> 00:05:35,050
it really becomes a big part of how they
view and if you want to take that away

98
00:05:35,051 --> 00:05:37,360
from them, it's like, you know, yeah.

99
00:05:37,361 --> 00:05:39,820
So you can see that when
you're having the discussion,

100
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:44,830
it's especially obvious in a debate
format because they basically,

101
00:05:46,631 --> 00:05:50,320
nobody has any hope that that either
side is going to change their mind in the

102
00:05:50,321 --> 00:05:51,250
context of the debate.
I mean,

103
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:56,251
they've come there to represent their
views and they've got so much invested in

104
00:05:56,561 --> 00:06:00,530
doing as well as as they can that they're
not, even if they're mine was changed,

105
00:06:00,531 --> 00:06:03,050
they're not going to admit it. It. So
it's not really an honest discussion.

106
00:06:03,051 --> 00:06:05,900
But when you are having
an honest discussion,

107
00:06:05,901 --> 00:06:09,650
let's say we know one on one with
somebody of deep conviction about faith,

108
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,060
you can,

109
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:15,800
you can see the kind of the emotional
hijacking of the conversation on their

110
00:06:15,801 --> 00:06:17,150
side very quickly.
It's like,

111
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,960
it's basically like debating whether
they're their wife is attractive or

112
00:06:20,961 --> 00:06:21,381
something.
I mean,

113
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:25,580
it's just like a goes to something at
the core and it's no longer about the

114
00:06:25,581 --> 00:06:28,040
ideas or evidence or, or, um,

115
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:31,370
and so that it's one skill,

116
00:06:31,371 --> 00:06:36,260
which admittedly I,
I don't have a such a firm grasp on,

117
00:06:36,261 --> 00:06:40,130
but one skill to acquire just as a
person is to figure out how to have these

118
00:06:40,131 --> 00:06:44,430
conversations where you're, where
you're, you're being as rational and,

119
00:06:44,431 --> 00:06:46,040
and intellectually honest as possible,

120
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:51,070
but you're actually kind of making the
right Jujitsu moves around people's

121
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:55,890
emotional response because it's just
too with comedy. Well, yeah, I that,

122
00:06:55,891 --> 00:06:58,940
that's what's brilliant about comedy.
Yeah. You do it with comedy. Well,

123
00:06:58,941 --> 00:07:03,660
I've seen you do it, you know, compared
to Elvis being alive, you know,

124
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,910
and knowing that Elvis is alive,
feeling that he's alive. Yeah.

125
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,850
It was really very funny how you did it.

126
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:12,380
And it was the perfect way
to do it because you did
it very politely. You know,

127
00:07:12,381 --> 00:07:16,460
there was no name calling. You didn't
get all shouty. Yeah, yeah. But that,

128
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:20,080
that is what is brilliant about
pure comedy because if you,

129
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,480
if you make someone
laugh at themselves or,

130
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:27,050
or the idea that they
would otherwise defend, um,

131
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:31,130
you know, you've, that that actually
is a visible sign that you have,

132
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:35,030
you have made contact, you know,
cause it's, and, and you don't get,

133
00:07:35,031 --> 00:07:37,550
you don't get that when you,
when you're playing it totally straight.

134
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:40,400
And so comedy is very powerful.
Yeah.

135
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,460
Also,

136
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,630
obviously you're restricted
in the language that you
can use and these things,

137
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:49,580
right. It's, um, it is a,
a fascinating sort of a,

138
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:54,420
and an exchange. It's a, it's fascinating
to watch the psychological. We'll spin,

139
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:58,910
you know, when, when people
really get behind an idea,

140
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:00,570
whether it's religion or
whatever the fuck it is, when,

141
00:08:00,571 --> 00:08:03,000
when they really get behind it
to the point where, you know,

142
00:08:03,001 --> 00:08:05,070
they're not budging at all.
They're not thinking at all.

143
00:08:05,071 --> 00:08:09,060
They're attached and married to it. It's
very dangerous. Right. I mean, isn't it?

144
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,001
Oh, well, yeah,

145
00:08:10,001 --> 00:08:15,001
insofar as someone really
believes something and the
beliefs have any point of

146
00:08:15,131 --> 00:08:19,690
contact with behavior and the rest
of physical reality, I think it's,

147
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:24,870
it's, it's the most consequential thing.
I think what people believe is, yeah,

148
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,140
that is the,

149
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:31,300
the lever that moves most things in
our world. You know, it's politics,

150
00:08:31,301 --> 00:08:35,680
it's public policy, it's the laws
we write in the law as we choose to,

151
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:39,700
to truly defend and,
and they're all just ideas that are,

152
00:08:39,701 --> 00:08:43,390
that have a certain number of subscribers.
Is it

153
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:48,640
possible that religion in its form is
useful for some people because they're

154
00:08:49,491 --> 00:08:53,390
just what a,
whether it's psychologically they need,

155
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,160
they need some scaffolding,
whether it's, you know,

156
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:01,230
Eh, to use it as a tool, not
to use it to control anyone,

157
00:09:01,231 --> 00:09:04,650
but to use it as like a personal growth
tool. Do you ever look at it like that?

158
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,353
Well,

159
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:12,540
in so far as it can be taken out
of the belief space where it says,

160
00:09:12,951 --> 00:09:17,010
so there's, there's the, the, the
doctrinal belief based part of religion,

161
00:09:17,011 --> 00:09:20,100
which is where people are making
claims about reality on bad evidence.

162
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,860
And that I,
that's just a problem.

163
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:25,710
I mean so far as your pretending to be
certain about something you shouldn't be

164
00:09:25,711 --> 00:09:28,740
certain about and then
teaching your kids to do that.

165
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:32,910
That's just a problem for our,
for our conversation with one another.

166
00:09:32,911 --> 00:09:34,070
As human beings,
there's,

167
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,430
there's all this other stuff that people
are attached to that isn't inherently

168
00:09:38,431 --> 00:09:41,490
problematic. So they liked the music,
they liked the buildings, they like the,

169
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:46,170
the style, you know, they like
the artwork. They like the, um,

170
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:50,010
they like to think about certain historic
figures who they have this sort of

171
00:09:50,011 --> 00:09:52,030
emotional bonding widths or GNC.

172
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:55,680
They love the stories about Jesus
in the New Testament. And, um,

173
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:00,870
all of that is, uh, some of that
could be intrinsically good. I mean,

174
00:10:00,871 --> 00:10:01,650
if you get the right,

175
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:04,650
you get beautiful buildings and beautiful
music and a reason to come together

176
00:10:04,651 --> 00:10:05,790
and holidays and Mso.

177
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,930
So I think we actually want something
very much like that in secular culture.

178
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,400
And we,
and we,

179
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:16,490
I think are suffering from the fact that
we don't have an obvious alternative,

180
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:20,030
a secular, reasonable, reasonable
alternative to that, um,

181
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:22,840
that we can just point religious
people to and say, no way, no,

182
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,510
how come you're not doing
that? You know, this,

183
00:10:24,511 --> 00:10:28,260
this has everything you want without the
bullshit. That's very important. And,

184
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:31,140
you know, if someone tried to form
some sort of a secular group like that,

185
00:10:31,141 --> 00:10:35,250
it would quickly devolve into
being a cult, most likely. Yeah.

186
00:10:35,251 --> 00:10:39,540
Depending on who become someone
trying to fuck everybody's wife. Well,

187
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:44,900
we had some other top that comes when
someone's at the top who has the eternal

188
00:10:44,941 --> 00:10:47,400
wisdom, uh, and it is important to you.

189
00:10:47,401 --> 00:10:51,780
And part of that process of
dispensation is to fuck your wife.

190
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:55,120
Uh, that there's actually a story. I,

191
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:59,200
I think I had told in an end note at
the end of faith, I knew some guys who,

192
00:10:59,201 --> 00:11:04,201
who brought out a guru from India
who they just thought was just the,

193
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,740
quite literally the Messiah who's,
he was a story.

194
00:11:06,741 --> 00:11:11,640
They kind of naked yoga and the yoga who
just for this little little, uh, um, uh,

195
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,260
almost a speedo track a speedo. Yeah.
Like a and long Jetta, you know,

196
00:11:16,261 --> 00:11:21,040
long dreadlocks and he's kind of this
kind of gorgeous 25 year old Indian Sato

197
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,850
who was silent,
so he wouldn't even never speak.

198
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,760
So though the only wisdom is very
kind of low bandwidth teaching,

199
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:30,000
the only wisdom you're going to get from
him is what he could write out on a,

200
00:11:30,001 --> 00:11:33,390
on a, like an eight by 10 chalkboard.
So he'd write these, you know,

201
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:37,320
just gnomic little sentences in
response to your, your questions.

202
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:41,160
And he was a really good drummer.
So he would leave these curtains,

203
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:44,210
these devotional chanting, uh, uh,

204
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:48,390
sessions where he would drum and people
would get a quote quite out of their

205
00:11:48,391 --> 00:11:52,440
minds and happy. And so they were just
worshiping this guy. They brought him out.

206
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:53,323
Um,

207
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:58,180
and at a certain point he can be,
I don't know how,

208
00:11:58,181 --> 00:11:59,800
he must have communicated
this on his chalkboard.

209
00:11:59,801 --> 00:12:04,360
He said he needed to start sleeping
with the various, you know, um, uh, as,

210
00:12:04,361 --> 00:12:08,950
as luck would have it, the, the most
beautiful wives of his devotees. Um,

211
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:14,230
and so he was doing that and, but
the breaking point came when, uh, uh,

212
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:18,020
the one guy who was his host whose
wife was sleeping with him, um,

213
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,990
gave him Haagen Daz this Saudi wanted to,

214
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:27,010
to eat Haagen Daz Vanilla ice cream with
cashews for breakfast. So that was like,

215
00:12:27,011 --> 00:12:29,290
he, someone gave him Haagen
Daas and it blew his mind.

216
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:32,260
And so he needed this for
breakfast. Uh, so the,

217
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:34,960
so he was Wa this guy was
walking through the, you know,

218
00:12:34,961 --> 00:12:38,260
like the Ralph's a
freezer aisle at, at, uh,

219
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,100
in the morning getting us a
resupply of vanilla ice cream.

220
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,910
And that was the moment that was the,
that was the,

221
00:12:44,911 --> 00:12:49,140
the final Straw where he realized,
okay, this guy is, is just,

222
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,500
we're just guys tool. And they just send
them back in India, you know, he's like,

223
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:56,830
you put the ice cream back on the shelf.
That's hilarious. Hacker bags. Yeah. No,

224
00:12:56,831 --> 00:12:59,180
it wasn't, it wasn't the wife.
It was the, it was the hug.

225
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:00,980
That's ridiculous.

226
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:04,540
So what did the Haagen daas
just represents something
so silly that it couldn't

227
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:04,720
be,

228
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,000
it was just, it was just too obviously
carnal. You know? Like there's no Tantra.

229
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:11,010
You might,
you might be doing tantra with my wife,

230
00:13:11,011 --> 00:13:14,420
but you're not doing top drawer with the
Haagen daas for breakfast Muesli Card

231
00:13:14,421 --> 00:13:15,254
or ice cream.

232
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:19,260
That's very funny. Yeah, man.
I mean, I think it's just a,

233
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:23,220
the primate instinct when any man is
in any position where he's got ultimate

234
00:13:23,221 --> 00:13:25,950
power over a group of people.
It's a terrible idea. Yeah.

235
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,970
That's why everybody's afraid of what's
going on right now was in terms of,

236
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,490
you know, government and new laws are
being passed every day. It's, it's good.

237
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,470
It gets kind of spooky.

238
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:37,590
It's like how much control do you
really need over people? Is this is,

239
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,740
I understand that you know,
we're in trouble some times.

240
00:13:40,741 --> 00:13:43,170
I understand that we're at war,
but do you really? How much,

241
00:13:43,171 --> 00:13:47,760
how much control does the
government really deserve
over people? I mean do, do we,

242
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:50,280
do we really need to be in this
situation we're in right now?

243
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,380
I, I, I'm, for the most part,

244
00:13:54,381 --> 00:13:57,440
I'm kind of libertarian on
this subject. I mean, I'm not,

245
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:02,300
I get a lot of flack from Libertarians
based on, on the, you know,

246
00:14:02,301 --> 00:14:05,720
the 5% where I depart from, you
know, classic libertarianism,

247
00:14:05,721 --> 00:14:10,410
but like actual defense authorization,
you know, I just think ea,

248
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:13,250
the principle is that peaceful,

249
00:14:13,251 --> 00:14:16,430
honest peoples have the right to be
left alone. You know, if someone,

250
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:21,080
if you're not harming other people and
you're not stealing from them and you're

251
00:14:21,081 --> 00:14:23,090
not yet, and you're honoring
your contracts, you know,

252
00:14:23,091 --> 00:14:24,950
maybe we can define what all that means.

253
00:14:24,951 --> 00:14:29,840
But if you are not an infringing on
other people's happiness, then you have,

254
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,160
you should have the
right to be left alone.

255
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:36,161
And what that means is we as a society
shouldn't want the police to kick in the

256
00:14:37,761 --> 00:14:41,750
door of a peaceful,
honest person to stop him from doing,

257
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,910
from what whatever it is he's doing,
smoking pot or you know, you know,

258
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:47,810
whatever victimless crime
is currently illegal.

259
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:52,340
And if you draw the line there,
I think get a very sane,

260
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:57,830
a response or very sane idea of
the limits of, of state power.

261
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:00,480
Um, and, and it's, um, yeah, it's, it's,

262
00:15:00,481 --> 00:15:04,910
it's all about mitigating harm
and keeping people safe. Now,

263
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,130
now obviously we can't,
we can only,

264
00:15:07,131 --> 00:15:11,810
there's a trade off between freedom and,
and risk.

265
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:16,270
So, you know, there's a
tension between let's say, um,

266
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:22,580
the, the right to privacy and
finding actual terrorists,

267
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:24,860
you know, so it's like if we,
if we, if we wanted to maximize,

268
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:28,310
we're going to find everyone who's a
terrorist, well then we would just,

269
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,500
there'd be no such
thing as privacy and we,

270
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:33,590
every day the government could read
all our email and looking our windows,

271
00:15:33,591 --> 00:15:35,510
et cetera. So there's, there's
a tension there and we,

272
00:15:35,511 --> 00:15:40,490
and we have to keep finding the, the,
um, the sweet spot, but it's, it's a,

273
00:15:40,491 --> 00:15:42,770
it's a tension that
everyone should recognize.

274
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:46,400
So do you think that these new laws
are being passed, like the Nda,

275
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:50,810
do you think that that's the idea
is that as the population increases,

276
00:15:50,811 --> 00:15:55,811
as is crime going to keep up or pick up
to a point where they're going to need

277
00:15:56,031 --> 00:15:57,540
something like this? I mean, when,

278
00:15:57,541 --> 00:16:01,670
when you think of someone being able to
detain people without warrants and not

279
00:16:01,671 --> 00:16:05,090
even have to inform their family and that,
that could be an American citizen,

280
00:16:05,091 --> 00:16:07,280
I mean, at what point in
time would that be effective?

281
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,640
You know? Yeah, I don't see, and again,

282
00:16:10,641 --> 00:16:15,050
this is not really my area to have a
very strong opinion. So, uh, you know,

283
00:16:15,051 --> 00:16:19,940
I would be open to any counter argument
on this, but I've never seen the, the, um,

284
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:25,870
the wisdom or necessity of
infringing on our existing laws to,

285
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,070
to fight the war on terror. So the idea
that, you know, the people at Guantanamo,

286
00:16:31,071 --> 00:16:31,940
I'm,
I understand that there,

287
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:36,860
there were different things apply on
a battlefield and, and, uh, you know,

288
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:40,580
in a crime fighting scenario
in, in, you know, in the states.

289
00:16:40,581 --> 00:16:42,620
But I mean,
why,

290
00:16:42,621 --> 00:16:47,600
why people don't have the right to
counsel or the right to see the evidence

291
00:16:47,601 --> 00:16:51,110
against them. I just, it seems like
it's crazy if they're guilty, you know,

292
00:16:51,111 --> 00:16:54,530
they'll let let the, the truth
shine on the, on the data.

293
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,280
Well what do we hurt is that
we were always, you know,

294
00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:01,390
growing up there was always a problem
with Russia and there was always this idea

295
00:17:01,391 --> 00:17:02,800
that we could go to war with Russia,

296
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:06,490
but there wasn't like a really strong
belief amongst people that we were the

297
00:17:06,491 --> 00:17:10,180
good guys and then we did all
good guys stuff. Only you know,

298
00:17:10,181 --> 00:17:14,830
that America was making sure the rest of
the world didn't start speaking German

299
00:17:14,831 --> 00:17:19,660
or Japanese or any case. But it doesn't
feel like that anymore, you know?

300
00:17:19,661 --> 00:17:24,661
Now it seems like as the
age of information has
gotten us to this 2012 date,

301
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:26,380
like where we're at right now,

302
00:17:26,381 --> 00:17:30,100
it's so easy to get information that
people are just so much more cynical about

303
00:17:30,101 --> 00:17:32,220
their intentions.
So if you see laws like this,

304
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:36,040
like what's the motivation to
crack down more on civil liberties?

305
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:39,590
He said just to make it easier
for them. I mean, is it to,

306
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:42,970
to create bigger government? What,
when, what is the motivation for that?

307
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,680
Well,
it's,

308
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:50,700
it is fear and some perception
of necessity of, of,

309
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:53,670
of, of taking the friction
out of, of the system,

310
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:57,720
the system that that would keep us safe
or respond to an attack or detect an

311
00:17:57,721 --> 00:17:59,050
attack.
Um,

312
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:03,900
and it's understandable when you think
about what the President's daily briefing

313
00:18:03,901 --> 00:18:07,200
must look like. You know, it's like,
it's gotta be absolutely terrifying. And,

314
00:18:07,201 --> 00:18:08,034
and the,

315
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:13,820
the reality of the prospect of nuclear
terrorism is like once you actually just

316
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:18,000
put those goggles on and say,
yes,

317
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:23,070
the nuclear non proliferation
proliferation is more
or less a lost cause.

318
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:26,520
I mean, the, the technology is
spreading, the material is spreading.

319
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:32,090
He got a 30,000 out of work scientists
in the former Soviet Union who have

320
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:34,830
every, who are not
taking care of, you know,

321
00:18:34,831 --> 00:18:39,490
who have every economic incentive
to not be entirely ethical. Um,

322
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:44,400
so if you feel as many people do this,
just a matter of time,

323
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:46,580
that new,

324
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,670
a nuke in some form gets into the
hands of terrorists and we have a,

325
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,310
a massively porous border.

326
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:56,730
The joke is if you want to get nukes
into the the U s you just hide it,

327
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:59,100
hide it in a bale of marijuana.
I mean, it's like we can't,

328
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:04,110
we can't fight the war on drugs. So the
idea that we can keep everything out is,

329
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:07,140
is pretty much a pipe dream.
So,

330
00:19:07,141 --> 00:19:12,141
so when you start thinking about the idea
of a new going off in a major American

331
00:19:12,181 --> 00:19:14,160
city and forget about the loss of life,

332
00:19:14,161 --> 00:19:17,590
just what would that do to
the world economy? It's,

333
00:19:17,591 --> 00:19:21,060
it's easy to see how the paranoia get
ramps up. So I, you know, I don't,

334
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:24,390
it's a hard, these are obviously
hard calls to make for,

335
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:27,780
for anyone and um,
you're going to look,

336
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:32,040
just imagine the day after
and an act of terrorism,

337
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:35,760
orders of magnitude bigger
than September 11th, what?

338
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:41,120
W two to have to talk about the reasons
why we didn't do all these things that

339
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:44,590
we could have done to keep, to
keep us safe. So I'm very much,

340
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:49,250
I mean I share your concerns about
infringing on civil liberties, but, uh,

341
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:52,590
it's just the way you
look. Scary. It's scary.

342
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:56,990
Or on the other side it scared
the threat is scarier. The fire,

343
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,530
I think the threat of,

344
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:02,830
of nuclear terrorism is
quite real. And, and, and,

345
00:20:02,831 --> 00:20:07,140
and anyone who thinks that it's not,
or that's just fearmongering.

346
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:11,760
Um, I just think it's not,
it's not reading, reading the,

347
00:20:11,761 --> 00:20:14,790
the books or papers of,
of experts who, who,

348
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,980
whose job it is to actually worry about
this. Uh, it's just, it's just not a,

349
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:25,170
uh, it's a real, it's a real problem. Uh,

350
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:29,720
so, uh, the question is in the
face of that, what do you do? Uh,

351
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:30,900
and you know,

352
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:36,020
I'm as annoyed as the thing you don't
do is force everyone to take their shoes

353
00:20:36,871 --> 00:20:38,770
off in airports until the end of time.
I mean,

354
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:42,740
so like we're so inefficient
in how we filter.

355
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:47,740
We filter and, and uh,
so yeah, I mean it's a,

356
00:20:47,741 --> 00:20:51,930
it's, it's a big problem.
That's a problem. Actually.
I don't know that much about,

357
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:55,340
I mean, my file on what we should do
is, it's pretty thin, but it's, it's,

358
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:56,620
it's pretty clear that,
you know,

359
00:20:56,621 --> 00:21:01,621
every time I'm in an airport and I see
some old Norwegian lady who obviously is

360
00:21:01,751 --> 00:21:03,730
not a terrorist,
uh,

361
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:09,300
submitting to the same search as a
somebody who looks like Osama bin Ladin.

362
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:14,050
Um, I, it seems like a
misallocation of attentional

363
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,950
resources. So yeah, it
seems ridiculous. Yeah.

364
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,040
It's just the idea behind it. So, and,
you know, what else freaks me out.

365
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:22,320
I was all the fucking radiation.

366
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:25,290
How much radiation of those
big body scanners is that?

367
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:29,430
Um, I don't know. I, I, but I,

368
00:21:29,431 --> 00:21:34,431
I would be concerned that
the manufacturers are not
entirely candid about,

369
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:39,880
uh, or even cognizant of, of the health
effects of them. So I, I don't know.

370
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:42,460
I mean, I, I haven't seen
the data on them, but yeah,

371
00:21:42,461 --> 00:21:44,980
you want to minimize the
amount of x rays you get,

372
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:49,090
but every time you want to play and you
get, you're getting dosed. So it's not,

373
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,120
I don't know how it compares
to the actual plane flight.

374
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,370
How much time are you day do you
think about nuclear terrorism?

375
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:58,650
Because if I was as you are, you know,
it's not a, it's not even every day. It's,

376
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:03,660
I put it out in my mind like,
like anyone else. Yeah. Well,
no, it's just, it's, it's,

377
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:07,210
um, the truth is, I,

378
00:22:07,211 --> 00:22:11,740
I believe you asked me rationally how,
how big a risk do I think it is.

379
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:15,970
I think it's, it's a, it's a big risk.
It's not a one in a hundred risk, I think.

380
00:22:15,971 --> 00:22:19,660
I think it's, well, that's what, you know,

381
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:24,720
experts like Graham Allison think in
this next decade that he wrote his book

382
00:22:25,001 --> 00:22:27,190
about five years ago,

383
00:22:27,191 --> 00:22:31,090
but he thought like next 10 or
20 year period, the chance of a,

384
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:35,410
a new going off in a major
American city was like 50, 50, not,

385
00:22:35,411 --> 00:22:38,470
not wanting a hundred. And, and so, and,

386
00:22:38,471 --> 00:22:40,540
and no one really criticized him for that.

387
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:45,541
I mean it's the people kind of a panel
of experts I think came up with 30%.

388
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:50,480
Right. So it's, but again, you're not,
you're not hearing the people say no,

389
00:22:50,481 --> 00:22:54,820
it's one in a thousand, um, 30%
terrifying. It's terrifying. And,

390
00:22:54,821 --> 00:22:57,670
and yet I don't feel that I have,

391
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:02,950
I don't really live with that piece of
software humming on the hard drive very

392
00:23:02,951 --> 00:23:07,570
much. I haven't integrated that
into my sense of, of daily risk.

393
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:10,210
Uh, so it's, it's not entirely,

394
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:13,780
I haven't responded entirely
rational link to that information.

395
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,050
But with all the different books that
you've written about religion and all the

396
00:23:17,051 --> 00:23:19,960
different debates that you've gotten
into with people about it, I mean,

397
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:23,890
you can't have a rosy view of
how this is going to turn out.

398
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:27,210
Do you,
do you think it's possible to,

399
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:31,660
the human race can pull out of this
[inaudible] right now to move to the next

400
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:34,310
level? Yeah, for sure. Well, I just don't,

401
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:39,640
the truth is I actually don't think in
terms of optimism and pessimism very much.

402
00:23:39,641 --> 00:23:44,380
I think I'm by default,
I slightly pessimistic,

403
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:49,210
but, um, you got to
live life and you want,

404
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:53,710
we all are just sort of trying to find
our way toward the high points of, of,

405
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,130
of wellbeing and,
and

406
00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:00,400
um, I think, uh,

407
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:06,120
I think, uh, I think culture can change
quickly. You know, that's, that's, it's,

408
00:24:06,121 --> 00:24:08,820
it's easy to,
it's easy to,

409
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:13,230
to deny how risky are our situation is.

410
00:24:13,231 --> 00:24:14,910
And I think that we shouldn't do that,

411
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:18,780
but it's also easy to overlook how
quickly we can get our act together.

412
00:24:18,781 --> 00:24:23,360
And so when you look at just how, I mean,
the example for me is, is the change in,

413
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:28,260
in, in views of race in the United States.
I mean, when you roll back the clock,

414
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:30,780
even 70 years,

415
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:34,290
there was just a level of racism
in this country. It was just,

416
00:24:34,291 --> 00:24:35,780
it was just unrecognizable.
It's having,

417
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:40,790
it's not that racism isn't
still a problem, but people
were being lynched and,

418
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:42,210
and there would,
you know,

419
00:24:42,211 --> 00:24:46,140
senators would come out and get their
photo taken in front of the dangling body.

420
00:24:46,141 --> 00:24:47,520
I mean, it was, it was just insanity.

421
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,013
MMM.

422
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:53,200
It's amazing. When you think of
how little time has passed. Yeah,

423
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,500
it is a very good point. Yeah. We will.

424
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:58,740
Racism probably is the one thing that
we've made the biggest amount of progress.

425
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,990
Yeah. Yeah. As far as culturally. Yeah.

426
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:03,750
And it's, it's, it's undeniable
progress. It's, it's,

427
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:08,780
and it's progress of a sword that it's
very hard to pick or what would cause us

428
00:25:10,111 --> 00:25:14,550
to sort of roll that back. I mean, I, it
feels like those are gains kind of just,

429
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:18,570
just gains in terms of standing
that we can't, can't lose.

430
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:22,820
I don't think we've fully felt the
impact of the Internet on culture either

431
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:25,970
because the first couple of generations
who grew up exclusively with the full

432
00:25:25,971 --> 00:25:29,150
access to information like that,
they haven't really reached adulthood yet.

433
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,321
And once,
you know,

434
00:25:30,321 --> 00:25:34,910
once these kids that grew up with the
internet their entire life and constantly

435
00:25:34,911 --> 00:25:37,830
having access to new ideas that aren't,
you know,

436
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:41,030
not regional people that they have to
talk to people in their neighborhood,

437
00:25:41,031 --> 00:25:41,601
people in their state.

438
00:25:41,601 --> 00:25:44,690
But instead of being able to talk to
people all over the world and get,

439
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:46,810
watch a lot of your shit
online, why don't you, you know,

440
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:49,400
watch a lot of different lectures online.
I mean that kind of,

441
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:53,000
there was nothing like that when we were
kids. The impact of that generation,

442
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:57,080
I think that's going to
be pretty substantial when
the case is now re I think

443
00:25:57,081 --> 00:25:59,930
that's going to be the next
big leap of cultural evolution.

444
00:25:59,931 --> 00:26:03,380
The Internet kids when they become
adults and start running shit. I think,

445
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:05,930
I think it's just the attitude online.

446
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:10,700
It does not mirror the attitude that
that's expressed in, in, in laws.

447
00:26:10,701 --> 00:26:14,780
And the idea is that people have
about about, uh, about our society.

448
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,170
Yeah. Yeah. I,

449
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:21,120
I'm a little war. I think it, it
goes, it can go either way there.

450
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:26,121
I think the Internet enables two very
different and antagonistic processes.

451
00:26:27,061 --> 00:26:31,470
On the one hand, it, it
does, it, it allows you to,

452
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:33,583
uh,

453
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,460
Hansel bad ideas very
quickly. It's like, it's hard.

454
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:39,750
It's very hard to lie about yourself
or about anything given access to

455
00:26:39,751 --> 00:26:41,910
information. So that's, that's very good.

456
00:26:41,911 --> 00:26:46,170
And it connects and people can see
how other people live. And so it's a,

457
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:48,750
all of that breaks down
barriers between people,

458
00:26:48,751 --> 00:26:53,751
but it also let it out also amplify a
certain voices too in a way that never

459
00:26:55,111 --> 00:26:57,820
would have happened before. And these
are, they're just terrible voices.

460
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,170
So for instance, Global Jihad, uh,

461
00:27:00,171 --> 00:27:05,171
the phenomenon of exporting al Qaeda
style Islam to the rest of the world more

462
00:27:05,911 --> 00:27:08,910
or less without friction is
entirely an internet phenomenon.

463
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,020
It's very hard to see that happening the
way it has in the last 10 years without

464
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:17,820
the Internet. Um, and just
just, hey, we have these,

465
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:23,080
any crazy person with his crazy idea
can create a little subculture on the

466
00:27:23,221 --> 00:27:28,140
Internet and you have this walled garden
where people can just talk endlessly,

467
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:32,940
uh, in a very self confirming
way. Um, whether it's,

468
00:27:32,941 --> 00:27:37,140
whether it's a certain conspiracy
theories or, or just, you know, racist,

469
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,600
racist subgroups, whatever.
And they, you just,

470
00:27:39,601 --> 00:27:43,830
you just get in there and you never get
out and you find enough people who are

471
00:27:43,831 --> 00:27:48,831
echoing back your bad ideas that you
and you never the other problems,

472
00:27:49,981 --> 00:27:53,550
you never meet these people. And
then, and then also the, the, the,

473
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:57,470
the role of anonymity online. I think
it's pretty destructive. I mean,

474
00:27:57,471 --> 00:28:00,420
if you've ever read a youtube comment
thread, which I'm sure you have,

475
00:28:00,421 --> 00:28:04,980
it's just the most poisonous
Lucy's. Yeah. It's amazing. It's a,

476
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:08,420
if you ran into people like that in real
life, you'd want to have a sword. Yeah.

477
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:13,810
Be Hacking through them everywhere you
went. Yeah. I don't, I, I see your point.

478
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,890
It makes, it makes a big, uh, the,

479
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:20,740
the anonymity makes a big
difference in having a lack of any,

480
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,790
any sort of repercussions
for shitty behavior. Yeah.

481
00:28:23,791 --> 00:28:25,360
That's not natural for humans.

482
00:28:25,361 --> 00:28:27,940
It's not natural for humans to be
able to affect each other with ideas,

483
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:30,070
without social cues, without, you know,

484
00:28:30,071 --> 00:28:33,340
feeling the emotions of someone whose
feelings you're hurting or you know,

485
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:37,000
to be able to do it. Like this is
just so, so cunty is what it is.

486
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:41,970
And even it's not even just inner internet
comment threads or even an amazing, I,

487
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:44,890
I find it with email, it's
like everyone's, this is,

488
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:46,810
this is now a trivial to point out,

489
00:28:46,811 --> 00:28:51,650
but everyone has sent the email
that they shouldn't have sent, uh,

490
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:56,860
and watched this even a very
good relationship unravel
based on the fact that

491
00:28:58,841 --> 00:29:03,040
there's, you're not being modulated
by facial cues when you're,

492
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:03,701
when you're saying,

493
00:29:03,701 --> 00:29:06,070
when you're dropping these bombs on
your friend or your brother or whatever,

494
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,430
and it just, it's just
escalates. Oh, the other hand,

495
00:29:09,431 --> 00:29:12,940
it's a good way to tell someone they're
fucking, that's what happened actually,

496
00:29:12,941 --> 00:29:14,850
to get all the information
in one place. Yeah. I'd

497
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:18,380
be in the room with them and you know,
have them argue with you about it,

498
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:21,640
you know, and that sense. Right? Yeah.

499
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,440
So when,

500
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:29,750
when you look at the possibility of
nuclear terrorism and, uh, you know,

501
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:32,210
you're, you're a fairly
young guy, you know,

502
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,470
and you look at all this is
insanity and chaos in the world.

503
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:40,850
What way do you think is going to be the
way out of this? Is it a technological,

504
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:42,130
I mean,
what's,

505
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:46,480
what's going to elevate people or make
people's ideas evolve to the point where

506
00:29:46,481 --> 00:29:50,730
they realize that this idea
is a completely ridiculous
nuclear wars? Absolutely.

507
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:54,280
A kid can't even be on the table. It can't
be an option for anyone in the world.

508
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:56,140
What's going to get us to that?

509
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,540
Well, it's a, it's a big
question. I think one, uh,

510
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:07,270
one piece of it is so accurate. It's
connects back with something you said,

511
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:12,440
this idea that we are the good guys and
that our enemies are aren't and there's,

512
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,260
there's not actually moral parody between
the two sides and in these conflicts.

513
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,530
I think that's still true.
You know, Guantanamo Bay,

514
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,420
it can be make it as bad as you want it.

515
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:26,680
It's still true that we're the good guys
in, in this particular conflict. And,

516
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:27,550
um,

517
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:32,440
now I wish we were better than we are and
there's obviously some bad guys on our

518
00:30:32,441 --> 00:30:35,090
side and in any given moment, but, um,

519
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:40,350
I think the one thing we
have to get past is this,

520
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:48,520
the kind of moral relativism that you,
you tend to hear from the left. Um,

521
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:52,990
and I'm, I'm very much on the left in
almost every respect, but, uh, this,

522
00:30:52,991 --> 00:30:57,700
this disempowering idea that we,
uh,

523
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,560
so for instance, to talk
about nuclear bombs, you know,

524
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:04,330
we should [inaudible] what gives us the
right to have nuclear bombs. If, if we,

525
00:31:04,331 --> 00:31:06,550
if we are going to have them,
Iran should have them. You know,

526
00:31:06,551 --> 00:31:11,551
we have no argument to keep Iran a
nuclear free if we keep oms ourselves.

527
00:31:12,071 --> 00:31:15,910
Well, we're a very different from Iran
at this moment. We're not, you know,

528
00:31:15,911 --> 00:31:18,550
our president doesn't get in front of
the microphone and say that he's going to

529
00:31:18,551 --> 00:31:23,110
wipe out a turned turn a
country into a lake of fire. Um,

530
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:27,880
and he's not waiting for the Messiah to
come back and, and, and rapture everybody.

531
00:31:27,881 --> 00:31:31,840
Now,
if we had a sufficiently crazy president,

532
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:37,090
well then all of a sudden we
would have a similar liability,

533
00:31:37,091 --> 00:31:39,430
but we're not using,
we're,

534
00:31:39,431 --> 00:31:44,431
we're not prone to use nuclear bombs
in a flagrantly crazy apocalyptic way.

535
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,200
And we don't know from
everything. Iran says, uh,

536
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:55,270
they certainly seem capable of being just
as crazy as as we could fear. And so,

537
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:59,920
um, that's, that's a difference that,
that we have to just acknowledge.

538
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,770
And so it matters who gets
the bombs. And if, if,

539
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:07,750
if people who are quite
zealous to die, uh, who,

540
00:32:07,751 --> 00:32:11,780
you know, people who are literally happy
to set off the bomb in their laps, uh,

541
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:14,950
just for the pleasure of setting it off,
uh,

542
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:20,380
that's a very different kind of
mind to be engaged with. And,

543
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:24,400
and it, it raises the stakes. It's not a
rat there. These people are not rational.

544
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:27,130
I'm not saying the entire Muslim
world fits this description, but,

545
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:31,000
but there are people who are not rational
actors based on their ideology. I mean,

546
00:32:31,001 --> 00:32:32,450
they want to get to paradise.
You know,

547
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:36,640
they think you win if you blow the
place up at the right moment. Um,

548
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:41,450
and the moment take on board that
certain people actually believe that,

549
00:32:41,451 --> 00:32:46,451
then you have to play a different game
with respect to the risk that they pose a

550
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:51,350
so it, so what we should do, I
think we, I think we need to one,

551
00:32:51,351 --> 00:32:55,620
acknowledge that they're
very different moments of,

552
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,560
of tension in this world.

553
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:01,670
Those where we're dealing with rational
actors and those where we're dealing

554
00:33:01,671 --> 00:33:03,350
with, with, uh,

555
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:08,270
either completely irrational actors or
actors where they have an ideology that's

556
00:33:08,271 --> 00:33:12,760
motivating them to do things
that should be unthinkable. Well,

557
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:16,870
completely agree with you that we have
to be aware of a religious zealots and we

558
00:33:16,871 --> 00:33:19,900
have to be aware of a crazy people
willing to blow themselves up.

559
00:33:19,901 --> 00:33:22,060
But you got to wonder why they're
mad at us in the first place.

560
00:33:22,061 --> 00:33:26,890
And I agree that for the
most part, I mean, I,

561
00:33:26,891 --> 00:33:31,630
I think our idea still sort of holds
that we're the good guy in comparison to

562
00:33:31,631 --> 00:33:32,464
the rest of the world.

563
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:37,420
Does that mean you have to be a
certain amount of evil just to keep up,

564
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:38,830
you know, just to compete? I mean,

565
00:33:38,831 --> 00:33:41,230
is that what's fucked up
with our foreign policy?

566
00:33:41,231 --> 00:33:45,490
Is that why we go into places like Iraq
with false information about weapons of

567
00:33:45,491 --> 00:33:48,330
mass destruction, where it was, there's a
clear motivation to get in there. Right.

568
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,640
Well, I think you're
right. I mean, I'm not,

569
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:55,500
I'm not going to defend a rock that I
think was, was a stupid war to fight.

570
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:58,930
That's going into Afghanistan that
just ended, you know what I'm saying?

571
00:33:58,931 --> 00:33:59,910
I mean that's what we're looking at.

572
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:02,560
Afghanistan is the clearer
case because we really,

573
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:05,110
I think had to go in and
after September 11th.

574
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:10,620
And so you think we had to go in tits
control al Qaeda cause well it was,

575
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:15,530
it was rational to go in and try to kill
Osama bin Ladin and, and the rest of,

576
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:19,750
of, uh, the people who brought
us September 11th. And, um,

577
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:21,050
and it was,
and we were,

578
00:34:21,051 --> 00:34:25,150
we at September 11th to some degree was
a price paid for never having dealt with

579
00:34:25,151 --> 00:34:26,810
these people in the first
place. I mean, they, they,

580
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:29,920
that when you listen to the chatter on
their side about how we were a paper

581
00:34:29,921 --> 00:34:32,860
tiger, that, you know, they
could blow up the coal,

582
00:34:32,861 --> 00:34:36,160
they could blow up embassies in Kenya.
They could, they could, you know,

583
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:39,620
w w w we got bombed in Lebanon
and we just left. I mean,

584
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:44,440
so we were scared of conflict
after Vietnam and, um,

585
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:49,330
that was noticeable to everyone on
their side. And, um, so we were,

586
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:52,570
so, to some degree, this problem was just
getting bigger and bigger and bigger.

587
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,570
And when you ask him,

588
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:57,650
it's possible September 11th happened
because we didn't invade Iraq earlier

589
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,360
cause we didn't go in Afghanistan earlier.

590
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:03,950
Well, no, we didn't deal with the
threat of, of Jihadi terrorism earlier.

591
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:07,160
Weren't they upset in the
first place because we're, we,

592
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:08,870
we have troops on their land.

593
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:10,183
Well,

594
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:15,620
you gotta be precise about exactly why
that's offensive when you look at why

595
00:35:15,621 --> 00:35:19,070
Osama bin Ladin and the rest of, of, uh,

596
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:20,750
Okaydo were upset.

597
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:26,030
It was because it was not because it
was not a nationalistic concern of,

598
00:35:26,031 --> 00:35:29,900
you know, we're proud Saudis and
our holy land, right. It was,

599
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:32,130
this was a theological
grievance. I mean, they were,

600
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:35,990
Osama bin Laden was
already out of sorts with,

601
00:35:35,991 --> 00:35:40,770
with the Saudi government at
that point. And He's, um, uh,

602
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:46,170
a Sama and anyone else enamored of this
whole notion of global jihad want a

603
00:35:46,171 --> 00:35:49,500
global caliphate. I mean this, this
is the idea that, that, that is,

604
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:54,530
that we're living in a perverse
time where Islam has been,

605
00:35:55,260 --> 00:36:00,180
has been delegated and subjugated
and has a, has not yet triumph.

606
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:04,470
And the, and it has a mandate
to triumph in this world. And,

607
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,660
and so if you really believe that,
if you have to believe,

608
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:11,070
if you believe that you have to
fight to spread the true faith, um,

609
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:15,300
for the glory of God in this
life and win the game, you know,

610
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:20,480
Gangas con style or more relevantly
Muhammad style in this life that is,

611
00:36:21,481 --> 00:36:26,370
that dictates a certain kind of
grandiosity and arrogance and,

612
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:31,400
and expansionism and people like
Osama bin Laden a really believe that.

613
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:36,660
And, and, but he was free to live a very
different life than he, than he lived.

614
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:41,160
You know, he said he didn't have to
spend his time in caves scheming to, uh,

615
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:45,930
to defeat the Great Satan. He could've
just been chilling in Paris. I mean,

616
00:36:45,931 --> 00:36:49,380
he had a lot of money
and a lot of opportunity.

617
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,920
Do you buy the official story how they
killed him and threw him in the ocean?

618
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:55,203
Um,

619
00:36:56,100 --> 00:37:00,240
I haven't thought about what might
not be true in it, but it seemed,

620
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:04,050
I basically, I buy the, I buy the official
story that we went in and killed him.

621
00:37:04,051 --> 00:37:08,040
And what happened to his body?
I am or why? I'm not sure.

622
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:09,970
I think we didn't,
uh,

623
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:13,170
I think it would be amazing if he was
dead a long time ago and they just

624
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:18,060
concocted a, a crazy hero rescue story.
Jessica Lynch thing. That would be,

625
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:23,070
I think, I think the, uh, no, I mean,
cause it would have been so many other,

626
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,500
if you will, if you were going to fake
something like that, first of all,

627
00:37:25,501 --> 00:37:29,310
it's just so hard to fake anything and
we couldn't fake Jessica Lynch. You know,

628
00:37:29,311 --> 00:37:31,200
it's like,
it's like you get people's,

629
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:36,510
this is what's wrong with most it with
helicopters, right? Yeah. And it's,

630
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:39,750
it's, there's just too, eh, these things,

631
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:44,520
operations like that go wrong
spectacularly and everyone
knows about it and they

632
00:37:44,521 --> 00:37:45,750
go right sometimes.

633
00:37:45,751 --> 00:37:50,010
And it's very difficult to fake at the
Pakistanis aren't acting like we faked it,

634
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:53,130
you know, they're just pissed that we
actually successfully got in there.

635
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:57,030
Seal team six style and,
and, and got out. Um,

636
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,900
so,
but the problem with,

637
00:37:59,901 --> 00:38:04,470
with any conspiracy of that sort,
and especially a bigger one,

638
00:38:04,471 --> 00:38:09,471
like a nine 11 truth style conspiracy
is that it's just takes so much perfect

639
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:13,710
collaboration to bring it off.

640
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:17,880
And we know that people are so bad at
that we know that interests don't align so

641
00:38:17,881 --> 00:38:18,714
perfectly.

642
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:22,350
We know that there's always somebody
who just wants to sell their story to a

643
00:38:22,351 --> 00:38:24,540
tabloid or it feels guilty about their,

644
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:29,310
the part they played or are they getting
divorced and they just can't stop

645
00:38:29,311 --> 00:38:33,150
talking. And it, Bill Clinton
couldn't keep a semen stain,

646
00:38:33,151 --> 00:38:35,460
dress out off of the news. You
know, it's like, it's like,

647
00:38:35,461 --> 00:38:36,790
that's the simplest thing.
You know,

648
00:38:36,791 --> 00:38:41,791
he's just like the present United States
with a terrified intern and this is

649
00:38:41,981 --> 00:38:45,490
going to wreck his presidency.
And he still couldn't keep the dress.

650
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:47,790
Uh, see, I see. Well he
couldn't keep that dress,

651
00:38:47,791 --> 00:38:50,390
but how many freaks he think
he banged my head as president.

652
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:52,650
That guy was just whipping out
his dick left and right. And

653
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:58,440
that's probably why he isn't talking
about it once. You're a freak,

654
00:38:58,441 --> 00:39:00,420
you're a freak. And when you're
a freak of the highest order,

655
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:02,580
where you want to be the king
of the world and you know,

656
00:39:02,581 --> 00:39:04,170
you're whipping your dick out in meetings.

657
00:39:04,171 --> 00:39:06,660
Like he would meet with women and just
whip his dick out and would run out of

658
00:39:06,661 --> 00:39:10,380
the room screaming that I did that shit
a lot, but he couldn't. But, but again,

659
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:14,580
we have to know about that. We know about
one September 11th every other month.

660
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:18,090
Yeah. But you read, um, well they know he
did get a few girls. He got mad at him,

661
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,530
hitch wrote a great book.

662
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:24,380
No one left a lie to the triangulations
of William Jefferson Clinton. Really?

663
00:39:24,381 --> 00:39:27,750
He just took him down hard hitch.
Christopher Hitchens. Yeah. Yeah.

664
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:32,640
For about short book. It's like
150 pages really brutal. And I,

665
00:39:32,641 --> 00:39:34,890
and I don't, you know, I just, it's,

666
00:39:34,891 --> 00:39:38,490
you'll never quite think about
Clinton the same way. I mean, it just,

667
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:42,060
it just puts a fine point on everything
you just said. And it's, it's, yeah,

668
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:45,390
it's pretty brutal.
He has a tinge of ego that when he talks,

669
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,540
it always makes me wonder what he's
really like. You know, and I'll say thing,

670
00:39:48,541 --> 00:39:52,800
you know, they have these
big political speeches. They
didn't do this. We did this.

671
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:56,850
When will the Democrats, we did
this, we did that. And you know,

672
00:39:56,851 --> 00:39:59,320
sort of bragging about stuff.
It's like, it's very unleashed.

673
00:39:59,321 --> 00:40:04,321
Or like at this stage of the game when
you go and look into his past dealings,

674
00:40:04,921 --> 00:40:09,810
like I read the strange death of Vince
Foster, that's a creepy goddamn book.

675
00:40:09,811 --> 00:40:11,250
I'd like to go back and reread that.

676
00:40:11,251 --> 00:40:15,450
He's a guy who was somehow involved in
that crazy real estate deal that they

677
00:40:15,451 --> 00:40:18,090
were with and they found him.
He shot himself,

678
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,860
but there was no blood at the scene.

679
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:24,000
So it was clear that his body had
been moved. Yeah, yeah. That, I mean,

680
00:40:24,001 --> 00:40:26,880
that's the kind of, again, I'm not saying

681
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:29,060
no one has ever murder,
no one ever spire is,

682
00:40:29,061 --> 00:40:33,560
but it's just so easy to manufacture
details like that that are then impossible

683
00:40:33,561 --> 00:40:35,950
to debunk. Like, so how do we know
there was no blood at the scene? I,

684
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:40,010
how do we know that some
18 year old didn't just say
that on his website and now

685
00:40:40,011 --> 00:40:42,800
that's the meme that gets spread and now
you have it in your head that there was

686
00:40:42,801 --> 00:40:45,860
no blood at the scene.
But it's so, so much.

687
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:51,140
So many conspiracies seem to be engineered
by that kind of chatter. And then,

688
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,880
but if you and I wanted to say,
okay,

689
00:40:52,881 --> 00:40:56,900
we're going to devote the next month of
our lives to just knocking down each one

690
00:40:56,901 --> 00:40:59,270
of those points. How would
we do it? Let me see.

691
00:40:59,271 --> 00:41:00,950
What were you going to
go to have to travel to,

692
00:41:00,951 --> 00:41:04,500
to find out whether there was blood at
the scene and talk to people wouldn't

693
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:04,630
know.

694
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:09,630
And it's just an endless sinkhole of
energy and yet it just takes a second to

695
00:41:10,101 --> 00:41:14,050
set that fire. And that's what
actually had happened in debate too.

696
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:19,100
There are certain people who you debate
on the subject or religion who know that

697
00:41:19,101 --> 00:41:24,101
they can start many small
fires and they're given,

698
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:26,510
you know, the eight minutes
for their side and they can,

699
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:30,200
they can set 30 small fires.
We get a half trues,

700
00:41:30,201 --> 00:41:34,130
untruths stuff that, you know, you
really should respond because it's just,

701
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:38,390
it's just false. Um, but it
takes you so long to put it,

702
00:41:38,391 --> 00:41:40,160
put the fires out that you just,

703
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:43,850
you can basically put half of them out
and then you haven't said any of what you

704
00:41:43,851 --> 00:41:46,820
came to say and then they
just come back and say, well,

705
00:41:46,821 --> 00:41:50,780
he didn't put out fires
three, four, eight, nine. And
so he's clearly conceited,

706
00:41:50,781 --> 00:41:54,370
my points. And, and it's just a
gate. It's a debating game, right?

707
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:59,390
Dinesh D'souza is and egregious, uh,
uh, example of that in technique.

708
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:04,460
It's just if you ever see, he did
a debate with, um, Daniel Dennett,

709
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:09,250
uh, which was, you know,
really didn't serve, uh,

710
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:11,060
Dan very well because he,
it was just,

711
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:16,400
it was a technique that was
quite effective. He just,
it's a fast talker and he,

712
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,340
he can just,
uh,

713
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:22,910
make a mess and it would take you an
hour and a half to clean it up. But

714
00:42:23,370 --> 00:42:27,330
I, I'm, I'm absolutely a agree
with you on everything you said.

715
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:30,870
But do you think that there
are real conspiracies?

716
00:42:30,871 --> 00:42:33,120
Do you think that every one of
these things is bullshit? I mean,

717
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:37,080
people clearly do conspire,
right and wrong was clearly a conspiracy.

718
00:42:37,081 --> 00:42:41,100
It might've been a conspiracy that we
entered into the Iraq war under false

719
00:42:41,101 --> 00:42:43,260
pretenses. I mean, it
might've been a conspiracy,

720
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:47,040
the Gulf of Tonkin incident and Vietnam.
That might've been a big conspiracy.

721
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:51,000
Yeah. There's no question that,
that from time to time, you know,

722
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:55,120
powerful people get into some star
chamber and twirl their mustaches and,

723
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:59,040
and conspire. I think that probably
happens, but it's just hard.

724
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:00,780
It's hard to bring it off.

725
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:05,510
And you should never assume
that's the case. And,

726
00:43:05,511 --> 00:43:07,890
and I mean this is,
there's an adage on this,

727
00:43:07,891 --> 00:43:11,970
on this subject that you did never ascribe
to conspiracy what can be explained

728
00:43:11,971 --> 00:43:15,630
by incompetence or something like
that. And, and it's just so obvious.

729
00:43:15,631 --> 00:43:19,980
The incompetence factor in many of these
situations is so high and so obvious

730
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:24,050
and as it is almost everywhere. Yeah.
And especially in government and with,

731
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:28,750
with September 11th, it's just, it's
just, I mean, the, the, it's just a,

732
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:33,390
just the crushing variable that it's
just, you know, we were just not,

733
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:38,790
we're not prepared to deal with that
kind of problem. And, um, you know,

734
00:43:38,791 --> 00:43:40,320
anyone who thinks this was a,

735
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:45,600
a conspiracy thinks
that at least hundreds,

736
00:43:45,601 --> 00:43:49,650
probably thousands of people woke up
one day. It's perfectly normal. People,

737
00:43:49,651 --> 00:43:52,630
people, the FAA, people in
the military, people, uh,

738
00:43:52,650 --> 00:43:57,650
in government woke up perfect
psychopaths willing without,

739
00:43:57,931 --> 00:44:01,770
with a clear conscience to murder 3000 of
their innocent neighbors. And not just,

740
00:44:01,771 --> 00:44:05,310
you know, not, this wasn't Tuskegee,
this wasn't the poor and disenfranchised.

741
00:44:05,311 --> 00:44:09,090
And you know, of a race that you're
not so fond of. This is, you know,

742
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:11,970
these are some of those powerful
people in our society just,

743
00:44:12,030 --> 00:44:13,350
just blown up one day.

744
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:18,380
And all of this was perfectly tuned
to leave the person at the top of the

745
00:44:19,051 --> 00:44:21,690
conspiracy.
Presumably George Bush sitting,

746
00:44:21,691 --> 00:44:24,960
reading my pet goat when the whole
thing kicked off. I mean, it's just,

747
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:30,120
it's ridiculous. It's, it's like a, and
then as a pretext to go into Iraq. If,

748
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,640
uh,
first of all,

749
00:44:32,641 --> 00:44:36,720
it would have been so much easier to think
of a pretext to go into Iraq, but why,

750
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:41,370
why make it look like the w we got bombed
or attacked by Saudis and Yemenis and

751
00:44:41,371 --> 00:44:45,810
Egyptians, which in fact is, oh, it looks
so you're saying as a motivation to, yeah,

752
00:44:45,811 --> 00:44:46,130
I mean the,

753
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:49,210
the general idea did it on purpose so
that we could go to war with Iraq. Yeah.

754
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:50,191
If you're,

755
00:44:50,191 --> 00:44:55,191
if you're thinking about that sort of
the false flag operation thesis that we

756
00:44:55,231 --> 00:44:58,080
wanted to go to Iraq and steal their oil,
but then we,

757
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:01,960
and we're perfectly evil and
perfectly machiavellian and,

758
00:45:01,961 --> 00:45:04,710
and it could bring this whole thing off
without any leaks to this day, you know,

759
00:45:04,711 --> 00:45:06,810
10 years hence,
no one has come forward and said,

760
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:09,940
this is the part I played in it
and I feel terrible about it. Um,

761
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:14,010
and yet we botched it in these,

762
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:19,280
in these huge ways where we had to go to
Afghanistan before Iraq and we'd really

763
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:21,720
didn't want to go to Afghanistan.
No one suggests.

764
00:45:21,721 --> 00:45:25,980
We actually wanted it to be running around
Tora Bora, um, fighting the Taliban.

765
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:30,950
And we go to Iraq. That worked out well.

766
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:35,140
I mean the idea that that was the easiest
way to get their oil. Uh, it's crazy.

767
00:45:35,141 --> 00:45:37,480
It would have been far cheaper to buy it.
Um,

768
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:42,170
but based on the arguments shape
of wanting to control Iraq,

769
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,990
I mean that we wanted to take
over and control their oil,

770
00:45:44,991 --> 00:45:46,250
which we kind of do now.
Right.

771
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:49,490
But we want it so if we
just wanted to go into Iraq,

772
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:52,820
that that took create a let,
let, let's buy the, the,

773
00:45:52,821 --> 00:45:57,821
the idea that people can spire and
that actually certain people in our

774
00:45:58,221 --> 00:45:59,090
government are willing to,

775
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:03,080
to run a false flag operation so
that we can go into Iraq. Okay.

776
00:46:03,290 --> 00:46:04,760
What would you have done?
You would have, you know,

777
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:07,890
you would have shot down one
of our planes over Iraq and,

778
00:46:08,010 --> 00:46:12,500
and which we wouldn't even have needed
that because Saddam was shooting and our

779
00:46:12,501 --> 00:46:16,660
planes, we had a no fly zone and force
for 10 years. And Saddam was, he,

780
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:19,760
the war wasn't over as far
as he was concerned. He just
kept shooting at planes.

781
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:20,691
He didn't hit any,

782
00:46:20,691 --> 00:46:25,580
but let's let him hit one hit
and then we then we would go in.

783
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:29,960
But it just, that killing 3000
people in downtown Manhattan,

784
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:32,630
uh, people who are well connected, who,

785
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:35,840
who and sending are the global
economy into a tailspin.

786
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:38,360
It just doesn't have
the right shape of it.

787
00:46:38,510 --> 00:46:41,330
I completely agree with you that it
would take way too many people to plan it

788
00:46:41,331 --> 00:46:43,220
out most likely.
And when I look at it,

789
00:46:43,221 --> 00:46:46,120
I just see it's someone's
going to tell theirs.

790
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:49,430
There's just too many things that have
to be coordinated to many people are

791
00:46:49,431 --> 00:46:51,050
going to start talking.
Just,

792
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,540
I agree with you that it's
much more likely in competence,

793
00:46:53,541 --> 00:46:56,900
but there was definitely a
motivation to go into Iraq.

794
00:46:56,930 --> 00:46:58,370
They wanted to go into our rack already.

795
00:46:58,371 --> 00:47:01,280
Then it's something they had been planning
on even before September 11th like

796
00:47:01,281 --> 00:47:04,220
looking for motivation.
So it's possible, right,

797
00:47:04,221 --> 00:47:08,300
that this incompetent government allowed
this attack to take place and then they

798
00:47:08,301 --> 00:47:10,130
capitalized on it.
But why was,

799
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,950
what was their motivation to
go to Iraq in the first place?

800
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:15,470
If they weren't going over
there to try to control the oil,

801
00:47:15,650 --> 00:47:17,540
then why were they so
desperate to go to Iraq?

802
00:47:17,541 --> 00:47:21,620
Because it was pretty clear that
they wanted to? Well, I think, um,

803
00:47:24,270 --> 00:47:28,650
and again, to some degree, I'm talking
out of my depth here because I'm not,

804
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:30,790
you know,
I'm not really like a policy guy,

805
00:47:30,791 --> 00:47:34,570
but the argument which was
made publicly at the time by,

806
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:38,940
by many so-called
neo-cons is that our rack,

807
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:43,600
because it was the perfect
test case for two to create a,

808
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:47,620
a vibrant democracy in the
heart of the Arab world. I mean,

809
00:47:47,621 --> 00:47:50,780
this is basically educated population.
Um,

810
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,670
the week completely underestimated
the level of sectarianism there. Um,

811
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:59,590
but again, that's easily ascribed
to incompetence. I mean, we just,

812
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:03,820
we were sending in 23 year old,
you know,

813
00:48:03,821 --> 00:48:07,750
friends of Bush with no expertise at
all just because they were the nephew of

814
00:48:07,751 --> 00:48:09,910
somebody who had donated to the campaign.

815
00:48:09,911 --> 00:48:13,570
And all of a sudden these people are
in charge of some major piece of the

816
00:48:13,571 --> 00:48:17,280
machine of how to create a democracy.
In Iraq. I mean, the level of,

817
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:22,760
to read any of those books about what we
did in Iraq is to just above everything

818
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:28,660
else, just to come face to face with,
with a shocking degree of incompetence.

819
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:32,980
So we're, the good guys were just in
competent. Well, let me look who is,

820
00:48:33,030 --> 00:48:36,780
look who he had in the Oval
Office at that moment. You know,

821
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:40,210
there's a lot of words come to mind when
you think about Bush and confidence is

822
00:48:40,211 --> 00:48:44,920
not, well, you know, bushes
of strange case, you know,
I mean obviously it's not a,

823
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,480
not the smartest guy in the world,

824
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:50,200
but when you look at like the
policies that he put into place,

825
00:48:50,201 --> 00:48:53,440
it's really similar to what Obama was
doing. It's not much difference at all.

826
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:58,360
Right. But that, I mean they're, I think
they're crucial differences, but, but

827
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:01,630
one,
two important things.

828
00:49:01,631 --> 00:49:06,370
One is that Obama has inherited
the world that Bush helped make.

829
00:49:06,371 --> 00:49:10,210
So, so no, but Obama has got the hardest
job on planet earth at the moment.

830
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:13,620
You blame Bush for the whole
Iraq mess. Do you? Brilliant.

831
00:49:13,630 --> 00:49:17,890
Or his administration at least. Yeah.
Well, we didn't have to go into Iraq and,

832
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:21,160
and it was, uh, we could have

833
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:26,170
arguably we had to go into
Afghanistan. I mean, I think, I think,

834
00:49:27,790 --> 00:49:32,100
I think our approach to fight
in the war on terror is, is, um,

835
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:34,660
fundamentally ill conceived.
I don't,

836
00:49:34,661 --> 00:49:39,661
I don't see why we need to be fighting
wars and taking credit for fighting wars.

837
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:43,630
I mean, this, this should, from my
point of view would be all covert,

838
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:47,030
all JB seals and stuff. Yeah. I mean,

839
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:49,660
in so far as all of his fascination,

840
00:49:49,661 --> 00:49:51,490
there may be situations
where that's not possible,

841
00:49:51,491 --> 00:49:54,140
but I don't see why we need to be a w we,

842
00:49:54,141 --> 00:49:58,240
we should fight the war on terror as a,
um,

843
00:49:59,590 --> 00:50:02,700
as a crime, as an international
crime problem. Uh,

844
00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:05,800
and that has occasional
military solutions.

845
00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:08,920
But from my point of view,
our people, you know,

846
00:50:08,921 --> 00:50:13,840
jihadis in al Qaeda should just have
been disappearing and no one takes credit

847
00:50:13,841 --> 00:50:18,100
for it. So why should we ever say we
did it? We know. Yes, we did it. And,

848
00:50:18,430 --> 00:50:22,450
and now there's a possible
blow back to that. And I mean,
the reality is, you know,

849
00:50:22,451 --> 00:50:27,451
whenever you put navy seals on the ground
and let them shoot they oral or drop

850
00:50:28,581 --> 00:50:30,530
bombs from, you know, Predator drones,

851
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:34,340
you're going to be killing some number
of innocent people. And that's terrible.

852
00:50:34,341 --> 00:50:37,510
And the terrible truth is there
is no alternative to that. I mean,

853
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:41,990
unless you're going to be a pacifist
that you're gonna run the risk of killing

854
00:50:41,991 --> 00:50:46,340
innocent people when you have to fight
certain conflicts. And, and so that's,

855
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:51,380
I just don't see any, it's, do you ever
look at it from their point of view?

856
00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:55,550
Do you ever low? Yeah. You try to look
at it from the [inaudible] point of view,

857
00:50:55,551 --> 00:50:56,510
the Taliban's point of view,

858
00:50:56,511 --> 00:51:00,110
the point of view of someone who is
watching this giant military and machine

859
00:51:00,111 --> 00:51:03,070
coming in and raping their
country's national resources. No,

860
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:06,620
but that's really minerals and okay,
but what's going on in Afghanistan?

861
00:51:06,870 --> 00:51:09,500
I think about Afghanistan for a moment.
What is the point?

862
00:51:09,501 --> 00:51:12,860
What's the point of view of a woman
in a Burka and Afghanistan? Now?

863
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:17,030
From my point of view, her,
it's very likely whether sheet,

864
00:51:17,031 --> 00:51:21,440
whether she knows it or not, there is a
much better life. She could be living.

865
00:51:21,590 --> 00:51:22,110
You know, the, the,

866
00:51:22,110 --> 00:51:25,520
the average life expectancy in
Afghanistan for women is 44 years.

867
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:26,900
It's got the highest,

868
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:31,730
almost the highest maternal mortality
and infant mortality in the world. Um,

869
00:51:31,850 --> 00:51:36,140
it's, it's, uh, you know, most
women are illiterate. It's just,

870
00:51:36,150 --> 00:51:40,110
it's a terrible life for women.
So one of the real, real,

871
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:42,650
when we think of having
to leave Afghanistan,

872
00:51:42,651 --> 00:51:46,580
one of the real ethical problems from my
point of view is we're just abandoning

873
00:51:46,581 --> 00:51:51,440
them to, the Taliban were abandoning the
women to the, to the Taliban. And, and if,

874
00:51:51,510 --> 00:51:53,930
if there was a way to actually help them,

875
00:51:55,790 --> 00:51:58,250
we would have a moral obligation to do it.

876
00:51:58,251 --> 00:52:01,100
The problem is it's so costly to do,

877
00:52:01,130 --> 00:52:06,100
it's so intrusive to do and so many people
shoot at you or blow themselves up a

878
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:09,800
while you do it, that there's, it's,

879
00:52:09,801 --> 00:52:12,100
it's completely impractical to do so.

880
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:16,190
I think we have a real problem ethically
till just abandoned women to getting

881
00:52:16,191 --> 00:52:19,930
their noses cut off because
they decided not to marry the,

882
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:24,200
the octogenarian that their father,
uh, sold them too. Well, you know,

883
00:52:24,201 --> 00:52:26,780
obviously I don't agree with any of
that stuff or any of those social

884
00:52:26,781 --> 00:52:27,740
restrictions they put on,

885
00:52:27,741 --> 00:52:31,160
but do you really think that we should
have troops overseas to try to reinforce

886
00:52:31,161 --> 00:52:35,090
our moral standards on this, this
country? That's a mess. I mean,

887
00:52:35,091 --> 00:52:39,860
should we really do that? I think we
that, is that what we're doing? No. No,

888
00:52:40,050 --> 00:52:43,580
but I think we need, well, we are
attempting to do that, but it's just,

889
00:52:43,610 --> 00:52:46,640
it's just not doable. I do really
think that's our motivation though.

890
00:52:46,810 --> 00:52:47,950
And went to degree.

891
00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:50,120
But what about the amount of money
that's they're pulling out of there?

892
00:52:50,330 --> 00:52:53,540
What about the amount of
money that they're making just
in minerals? Well, let me,

893
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:55,520
let me sidestep that
for a second and just,

894
00:52:55,550 --> 00:52:58,070
just talk about what I
think the end game is.

895
00:52:58,071 --> 00:53:02,990
The end game is to have a global
civilization that actually works.

896
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:04,400
And what, what would
that look like? It would,

897
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:08,540
it would look like more or less
what it looks like in any country.

898
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:11,690
And now whether you have a world
government that achieves this or some,

899
00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:16,730
some federation of states that works
better than, than certainly than the UN,

900
00:53:17,510 --> 00:53:22,440
you need to have, you know, if, if,
if w w girls were getting, you know,

901
00:53:22,441 --> 00:53:27,180
their, their noses cut off a and B and
being forced to live in Burkas in Florida,

902
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:30,950
it would be a crime problem and
we would send it, we have it,

903
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:33,440
we would send in police to, to, uh,

904
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:36,750
force people to treat their daughters
better or treat their wives better. And,

905
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:41,940
and that's, that's necessary
and appropriate. It's just,

906
00:53:41,941 --> 00:53:46,110
there's no mechanism that allows us to
do that as a matter of international law.

907
00:53:46,170 --> 00:53:46,561
And,

908
00:53:46,561 --> 00:53:51,561
and so we clearly have to get to a time
where when you have a hostage crisis

909
00:53:54,151 --> 00:53:57,780
where an entire country is
held hostage by some lunatic,

910
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:01,370
a or a group of lunatics
in the government, uh,

911
00:54:01,770 --> 00:54:04,170
is the matter of national
sovereignty is not an it, I mean,

912
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:06,760
who cares about the national
sovereignty of North Korea? That's a,

913
00:54:06,790 --> 00:54:08,760
that's a hostage situation.
Well,

914
00:54:08,761 --> 00:54:11,910
that's a really interesting point because
we negotiate with North Korea and we

915
00:54:11,911 --> 00:54:14,430
give them money and we're not even
thinking about going over there.

916
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:19,520
We give them money out of
compassion to alleviate starvation.

917
00:54:19,530 --> 00:54:22,980
We going over there because they have
nudes cause that what it is and they have

918
00:54:22,981 --> 00:54:25,910
so much artillery pointed
at South Korea and the,

919
00:54:25,911 --> 00:54:30,330
and the distance is so small that
they're nukes aside, they would just be,

920
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:32,700
it would be a disaster as it,
but it, but again, that's just,

921
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:37,770
that's an argument for not
letting these, these uh, um,

922
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:40,710
failed states and,
uh,

923
00:54:41,850 --> 00:54:46,070
deranged states get too strong.
I mean, that's so, I mean we, we,

924
00:54:46,071 --> 00:54:48,630
we need a way to,
to,

925
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:55,160
we need a way to convince the
entire civilized world of, of, uh,

926
00:54:55,230 --> 00:55:00,230
of functional democracies to apply quasi
global pressure to any one of these

927
00:55:01,861 --> 00:55:04,950
regions demanding that they
get their act together.

928
00:55:04,951 --> 00:55:09,870
And Afghanistan is definitely,
definitely a place that, that, um,

929
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:13,770
where it would be compassionate
if we could come in, you
know, if we could get, if,

930
00:55:13,771 --> 00:55:15,090
if every,
if,

931
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:19,650
if Russia and China and everyone else
could get on the same page with us and we

932
00:55:19,651 --> 00:55:23,880
could all agree, all right, the women of
Afghanistan, we actually need to help you.

933
00:55:23,910 --> 00:55:27,090
So how are we going to do
this? We're going to it. The,

934
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:29,610
the first pass we're
going to, we're, you know,

935
00:55:29,611 --> 00:55:34,611
any guy who's throwing a battery acid in
the face of little girls because they,

936
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:36,630
they want to go to school.
Okay.

937
00:55:36,631 --> 00:55:41,280
That we're going to deal with that
guy a as the sociopath that he is.

938
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:45,070
Um, and if it just so happens that there's
a culture of those guys and they call

939
00:55:45,071 --> 00:55:49,170
themselves, the Taliban were going to deal
with the Taliban as a, as a, you know,

940
00:55:49,171 --> 00:55:53,940
a gang of, of, of
sociopaths. Um, but again,

941
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:54,541
this is just,
it's,

942
00:55:54,541 --> 00:55:59,541
so we tried it on her own more or less
on our own and the results have been

943
00:56:00,030 --> 00:56:03,390
terrible. And, and the results
have been terrible because of the,

944
00:56:04,350 --> 00:56:08,610
largely because of the role that religious
thinking plays there. I mean, we,

945
00:56:08,611 --> 00:56:09,980
you know, you, you burn a curry,

946
00:56:10,010 --> 00:56:15,010
a Koran by accident and basically the
war's almost over and well last because,

947
00:56:18,270 --> 00:56:22,740
um, everyone takes to the streets and
begins killing people, uh, uh, you know,

948
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:26,740
there's nothing more inflammatory than
then trespassing on their religious

949
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:28,870
sensitivities. And, and you know,

950
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:32,560
if you accidentally bomb a
wedding and kill 50 children,

951
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:37,090
you don't get the response we recently
got with this current incident.

952
00:56:37,091 --> 00:56:38,890
And so it's, it's just, it's not,

953
00:56:38,891 --> 00:56:42,660
we're not dealing with a
culture that can have a,

954
00:56:42,750 --> 00:56:44,060
a sane discussion about,

955
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:45,793
uh,

956
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:51,680
the proper goals of human life and how
to, how to safeguard human happiness. And

957
00:56:52,470 --> 00:56:54,720
so in your mind,
we need to be the police of the world.

958
00:56:54,721 --> 00:56:56,670
We're the only ones who know what's right.

959
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:59,280
We're the only ones who are going
to enforce it, where the good guys.

960
00:56:59,281 --> 00:57:01,950
And so we need to go over there.
America,

961
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:05,400
just the military industrial complex
that runs America. I mean, what is it?

962
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:10,500
No. [inaudible] who's
we? We is, um, well just,

963
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:12,270
just look at again,
take,

964
00:57:12,271 --> 00:57:17,271
take one piece that you agreed on
are the gains we've made socially and

965
00:57:17,341 --> 00:57:20,640
culturally and moral a around, uh, racism.

966
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,490
So we have,

967
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:28,170
we're at least seeing the daylight on
the subject of race in this country.

968
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:33,380
Now we have the benefit of a kind of a
running start ahead of South Africa and

969
00:57:34,891 --> 00:57:39,810
we see they've got their apartheid
thing going on. Uh, and we begin,

970
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:44,520
it takes us a while, but we begin to apply
pressure to them, you know, boycott in,

971
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:49,170
uh, uh, uh, trade with South Africa
and, or, or, or blocking trade.

972
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,910
And that has an effect now that's,
um,

973
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:58,410
if you could get the entire world on the
same page on each of these questions.

974
00:57:58,411 --> 00:58:02,930
I mean, so the treatment of women is
even a bigger variable than, than, uh,

975
00:58:03,030 --> 00:58:05,460
notions of race because you're here,

976
00:58:05,461 --> 00:58:07,740
you're talking about fully
half of the human population.

977
00:58:07,770 --> 00:58:10,470
So wherever they're
treating women terribly,

978
00:58:11,170 --> 00:58:12,003
uh,

979
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:17,780
that's a, um, and systematically,
and not just, not by accident,

980
00:58:17,781 --> 00:58:22,600
but because of some ideology that women
can be treated terribly. That's a, um,

981
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:24,530
that's a human rights problem that every,

982
00:58:24,531 --> 00:58:29,531
every society that has a robust conception
of human rights can figure out how to

983
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:33,100
apply pressure to.
Now s

984
00:58:35,130 --> 00:58:39,720
stopping trade may not be enough.
Uh, and, and then you, you,

985
00:58:39,721 --> 00:58:43,820
you have all of these other secondary
effects of when you apply sanctions to a

986
00:58:43,821 --> 00:58:48,030
country, then the women and everyone
in kids and everyone else suffer. Um,

987
00:58:48,050 --> 00:58:51,200
and so it's, it's, it's such a
blunt instrument we don't have,

988
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:53,200
we don't have good tools to deal with.
Yeah.

989
00:58:53,230 --> 00:58:54,063
Problems.

990
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:59,130
I could see it as a justification one of
many as to why a part of the world was

991
00:59:01,061 --> 00:59:03,730
run by bad people with bad ideas.

992
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:06,430
But I don't think that's
the motivation to go there.

993
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:09,850
I don't think that's the main
motivation to go there. I just,

994
00:59:09,851 --> 00:59:12,910
I don't believe that the
army would act that way.

995
00:59:12,911 --> 00:59:15,970
That they would spend so much money
to go somewhere to save some women.

996
00:59:16,330 --> 00:59:17,163
I don't buy it.

997
00:59:17,270 --> 00:59:19,070
Well,
I'm not saying that's the only motivation,

998
00:59:19,071 --> 00:59:23,720
but it's one that you think is
one primary one. Well, it's, well,

999
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:24,680
again,

1000
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:29,500
I just would have to focus on any specific
conflict we're talking about. But so,

1001
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:33,680
but when you,
when you ask yourself why

1002
00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:39,950
they're there, so they're,
they're soldiers who've done
multiple tours of duty in,

1003
00:59:40,190 --> 00:59:45,190
in Afghanistan and feel committed to the
project and feel reasonably good about

1004
00:59:47,871 --> 00:59:51,140
what they've done. Why do they feel
that way? Why are they, why don't they,

1005
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:54,650
why don't they get up every morning
feeling like they're completely wasting

1006
00:59:54,651 --> 00:59:59,090
their life and taking massive risks
for no reason at all? Well, you know,

1007
00:59:59,091 --> 01:00:02,420
I'd have to interview each individual one
to find out what their motivation was,

1008
01:00:02,421 --> 01:00:06,650
but I look at, Afghanistan has
a giant moneymaking effort.

1009
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:10,550
I look at how much money they're making
and minerals and I don't think they send

1010
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:15,020
tanks and it's for save women. I
don't, I don't believe it's not, it's,

1011
01:00:15,050 --> 01:00:16,720
it's not a money.
It's,

1012
01:00:16,721 --> 01:00:20,660
it's the most co these to Afghanistan
and Iraq have been the most costly things

1013
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:26,400
we've [inaudible] we've made in people
but aren't huge military companies like,

1014
01:00:27,110 --> 01:00:29,910
like, uh, uh, how Burton and,

1015
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:34,640
and people that rebuild these places
and people that are contractors.

1016
01:00:34,641 --> 01:00:36,940
There's a lot of money being
spent, right? Well, yeah,

1017
01:00:36,990 --> 01:00:41,990
they're their companies
make money in times of war.

1018
01:00:42,021 --> 01:00:42,411
Yeah.
I mean,

1019
01:00:42,411 --> 01:00:45,830
so the people that do make bullets make
money when they get to sell bullets.

1020
01:00:45,831 --> 01:00:50,260
But in terms of the, um, the,

1021
01:00:50,270 --> 01:00:55,060
the cost to our economy in
general and the cost to, and,

1022
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:56,960
and, and, and the cost to,

1023
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:01,770
in the lives of the men and women
are military serving over there said,

1024
01:01:01,860 --> 01:01:02,631
so everyone who ha,

1025
01:01:02,631 --> 01:01:07,100
who none of the soldiers are extracting
wealth from the ground in Afghanistan or

1026
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:08,440
of course directing acting oil for.

1027
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:13,290
And yet when you hear them talk
about their experience, you,

1028
01:01:13,470 --> 01:01:17,360
what you don't hear is a litany of,
we never should have done that.

1029
01:01:17,361 --> 01:01:18,680
That was a complete waste of time.

1030
01:01:18,681 --> 01:01:21,080
I can't believe that our
government is not true at all.

1031
01:01:21,140 --> 01:01:23,720
I think there are a lot of
people online that are soldiers,

1032
01:01:23,721 --> 01:01:26,900
former soldiers that have a lot of those
stories. No, no, no. There's some of that.

1033
01:01:26,901 --> 01:01:31,730
I mean, it, you can't say, you never
hear, no, no, no, no. I'm not saying, but,

1034
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:34,700
but, but the, it's not
all of what you hear.

1035
01:01:34,701 --> 01:01:37,280
What you also hear is an experience of,

1036
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:40,900
of really trying to,
you know,

1037
01:01:40,910 --> 01:01:45,470
building schools or building know to
build infrastructure and really trying to

1038
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:48,860
help a democracy grow in,
in these places.

1039
01:01:48,861 --> 01:01:53,770
Now it is such a thankless
job. And again, I'm not,

1040
01:01:53,830 --> 01:01:54,663
don't,

1041
01:01:54,860 --> 01:01:59,060
don't mistake me for being optimistic or
it all sanguine about what's happening

1042
01:01:59,061 --> 01:02:02,480
in Iraq and Afghanistan. I think
it's been a disaster. And, um,

1043
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:07,170
but you think ultimately it's a good
idea? No, I, I, well, Iraq, no. Um,

1044
01:02:07,340 --> 01:02:11,450
Afghanistan, I think it was
absolutely essential that we,

1045
01:02:11,810 --> 01:02:14,780
we do something now. We clearly, we,

1046
01:02:14,781 --> 01:02:19,781
we did it badly from day
one who committing far too
few troops and our proxies

1047
01:02:20,610 --> 01:02:23,520
do it for us and do it badly.
And Osama bin Ladin got away.

1048
01:02:23,690 --> 01:02:26,420
But you see it as a war of culture.
You see,

1049
01:02:26,810 --> 01:02:29,180
I get bad people out of control,

1050
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:32,580
a country that they could
potentially be dangerous to us.

1051
01:02:32,581 --> 01:02:35,940
It was worth the preemptive
strike. Well, again,

1052
01:02:36,090 --> 01:02:40,220
let's just start talking about the big
picture. If you're, if you're a pacifist,

1053
01:02:40,250 --> 01:02:44,010
you think we should never do anything like
this. You as you never pull out a gun.

1054
01:02:44,011 --> 01:02:47,910
And start shooting or threatened to shoot
because nothing is worth killing for

1055
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:49,380
now.
I'm not a pacifist.

1056
01:02:49,381 --> 01:02:53,670
I think if we all took a Gandhi and
response to these problems and just,

1057
01:02:54,090 --> 01:02:57,890
you know, got on our Facebook
page and made a lot of noise, um,

1058
01:02:59,790 --> 01:03:04,790
that there are certain enemies we could
have and do have who will just inherit

1059
01:03:06,301 --> 01:03:11,190
the earth. I mean, so the thugs
will win. In that case, um, Gandhi,

1060
01:03:11,490 --> 01:03:15,000
Gandhi's nonviolence worked against the
British because the British were the

1061
01:03:15,001 --> 01:03:19,170
British and they had enough of a
conscience not to just kill everybody.

1062
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:23,970
It wouldn't have worked against Hitler.
Um, and uh, and Gandhi actually knew that.

1063
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:27,750
So, um, so the,

1064
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:30,450
if you're not going to be a pacifist,
then we're just,

1065
01:03:30,510 --> 01:03:33,950
then the question is just when
do you pull out the guns? Uh,

1066
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:38,730
and we can then have an intelligent
discussion about whether it made any sense

1067
01:03:38,731 --> 01:03:39,960
to pull out the guns,

1068
01:03:40,490 --> 01:03:43,840
these of Iraq or Afghanistan and um,

1069
01:03:43,950 --> 01:03:48,240
and you know, then, then it's
just a pragmatic question of, of,

1070
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:52,250
of when you do it and how, how
you, how it's best to do it.

1071
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:53,480
I can agree with Don.

1072
01:03:53,481 --> 01:03:56,690
I can agree that we need guns because
they're bad people in the world.

1073
01:03:56,691 --> 01:03:59,450
We need an army. We need
a military because they're
are bad people in the world.

1074
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:03,090
But then when you look about
our actions that define what,

1075
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:06,740
what our purposes with this army,
look at our two main campaigns,

1076
01:04:06,741 --> 01:04:10,550
Iraq and Afghanistan,
you've admitted they're both
complete fuckups and disaster.

1077
01:04:10,551 --> 01:04:14,840
So if that's the case, how do you think
the rest of the world will look at us?

1078
01:04:15,230 --> 01:04:17,000
Why wouldn't they be upset with us?

1079
01:04:17,001 --> 01:04:21,980
It seems to me that these campaigns have
done far more to hurt the way the rest

1080
01:04:21,981 --> 01:04:25,820
of the world wants to treat us. The name
thing else we could've ever done. Gone.

1081
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:30,050
Going to these places and blowing up
buildings and killing whom and how many

1082
01:04:30,051 --> 01:04:33,110
hundreds of thousands of
innocent people died in Iraq.

1083
01:04:33,350 --> 01:04:35,610
And how many people are dying
every day in Afghanistan?

1084
01:04:35,630 --> 01:04:39,590
W do you think about the numbers that
have been piled up just to the actual raw

1085
01:04:39,591 --> 01:04:42,200
statistics as,
as motivation

1086
01:04:42,460 --> 01:04:47,170
for these people? Well, I think it's
had paradoxically has had both effects.

1087
01:04:47,190 --> 01:04:50,580
It has. Um, because look at,

1088
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:53,120
if we didn't go in to certain situations,
so it's like a,

1089
01:04:53,130 --> 01:04:56,050
when Libya was kicking off the,

1090
01:04:56,060 --> 01:04:58,960
the resistance was desperate for us
to come in. And we looked at that,

1091
01:04:58,961 --> 01:05:00,370
the kind of the,
the mealy mouth,

1092
01:05:00,390 --> 01:05:04,870
the approach we took just sort of
letting our allies to take the lead. Um,

1093
01:05:05,380 --> 01:05:08,230
that looked a little
bit like cowardice and,

1094
01:05:08,260 --> 01:05:13,260
and we got a lot of grief for not
actually being active enough to help,

1095
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:18,160
help prop up the, you know, the, the
Libyan, uh, that's a pretty case.

1096
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:20,440
You've got a guy's been a
dictator forever. And the people

1097
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:22,660
literally,
it was the same case.

1098
01:05:23,130 --> 01:05:26,780
People were not riding in the streets
because he was a better dictator. I mean,

1099
01:05:26,830 --> 01:05:31,120
it's like we, it was worse,
arguably worse in Iraq. Uh,

1100
01:05:31,150 --> 01:05:34,600
there were more reasons to
go in. The people were, um,

1101
01:05:35,380 --> 01:05:37,690
there was every expectation
that the people, uh,

1102
01:05:37,691 --> 01:05:40,720
enough of the people were
ready to be rid of Saddam,

1103
01:05:40,721 --> 01:05:45,580
that we could have been
graded as friends. And, um,

1104
01:05:46,810 --> 01:05:51,160
and yeah,
it was a disaster because for mainly B,

1105
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:54,420
because we underestimate the level
of sectarian violence that was,

1106
01:05:54,510 --> 01:05:58,600
was going to begin the moment
we took the lid off. And, um,

1107
01:05:59,730 --> 01:06:03,160
I mean, again, that's just, it just
incompetence but it's not, it's like,

1108
01:06:03,161 --> 01:06:03,581
so when you,

1109
01:06:03,581 --> 01:06:08,581
when you have Sunni Muslims
who are going to blow up a,

1110
01:06:09,370 --> 01:06:13,480
she a mosque, people who didn't even know
about that before they went into the,

1111
01:06:13,870 --> 01:06:15,580
well,
a lot of people didn't know you know it,

1112
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:19,060
but we didn't even know the difference
between Sunni and Shia. Yeah.

1113
01:06:19,150 --> 01:06:22,000
I mean that we hate you had, you had,
you know, there's, you know, bloopers of,

1114
01:06:22,001 --> 01:06:25,550
of our, uh, you know, White
House press conferences where,

1115
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:29,930
where they're getting people's affiliation
wrong and not even thinking they're

1116
01:06:29,970 --> 01:06:30,803
interchangeable.

1117
01:06:30,980 --> 01:06:32,300
Do you think that these debates,

1118
01:06:32,301 --> 01:06:36,260
if you've had with all these
like fiercely religious people,

1119
01:06:36,290 --> 01:06:41,290
have they given you more of a
pessimistic thought or idea on how,

1120
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,420
how we need to handle people in other
parts of the world where their entire

1121
01:06:47,421 --> 01:06:51,170
cultures are run by religion?
I mean, does it, do you use,

1122
01:06:51,171 --> 01:06:55,310
do you like lose a bit of hope for
rational conversations to the point where

1123
01:06:55,311 --> 01:06:59,900
you're like, you know what,
you have to engage militarily,
there's no other option,

1124
01:06:59,901 --> 01:07:01,580
so you're never going
to get by with debate.

1125
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:03,330
You're never going to get
by with rational thought.

1126
01:07:03,331 --> 01:07:04,520
You never going to get by with reason.

1127
01:07:04,700 --> 01:07:07,940
You're talking about cultures that want
to murder you for burning some pages

1128
01:07:07,941 --> 01:07:08,774
accidentally.

1129
01:07:09,050 --> 01:07:12,350
You're talking about culture that wants
a murder you for drawing their guy,

1130
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:13,230
right?

1131
01:07:13,230 --> 01:07:15,570
Yeah. Well I think it's not, it doesn't,

1132
01:07:15,630 --> 01:07:19,050
it's not partitions so easily by state,

1133
01:07:19,051 --> 01:07:22,980
but I think I view it as kind of
concentric circles. So it's, so again,

1134
01:07:23,010 --> 01:07:24,660
we're talking about Islam
here for the moment.

1135
01:07:25,620 --> 01:07:29,490
You have this sort of the center
of the Bullseye of doctrinal,

1136
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:34,290
crazy global jihadist Islam
where yeah, I think, you know,

1137
01:07:34,291 --> 01:07:36,090
al Qaeda and al Qaeda,

1138
01:07:36,091 --> 01:07:39,300
like thinking that's just a deal breaker.

1139
01:07:39,330 --> 01:07:42,960
I mean it was a word war with that
subset of the Muslim world and the,

1140
01:07:42,970 --> 01:07:46,830
and they are not our idea
that we're at war with them.

1141
01:07:46,831 --> 01:07:50,970
They're at war with us. They'd answer.
We're talking about it. We're innocent.

1142
01:07:50,971 --> 01:07:52,860
We've done nothing.
We've done, we have done,

1143
01:07:52,890 --> 01:07:57,120
they are running a very
different game in their heads.

1144
01:07:57,121 --> 01:07:58,230
It's not about land.

1145
01:07:58,231 --> 01:08:02,280
It's not about the Palestinian does not
about it is they're living. They've got,

1146
01:08:02,310 --> 01:08:06,830
they've got these seventh century or
14th century goggles that they've, uh,

1147
01:08:06,870 --> 01:08:10,020
looking at the world
through. And you know, if we,

1148
01:08:10,021 --> 01:08:14,580
if we pipe bay watch over on
the satellite dish, that's a,

1149
01:08:14,610 --> 01:08:19,480
you an offense that they're willing
to die for. I mean we w w w it's a,

1150
01:08:19,490 --> 01:08:21,420
it's a very different game
they're playing there.

1151
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:26,910
You got to imagine what it's like to
really believe in paradise. You know,

1152
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:29,480
to really want to get there,
to know that,

1153
01:08:29,510 --> 01:08:32,360
that if you blow yourself
up killing infidels,

1154
01:08:32,390 --> 01:08:35,330
you're going to get there and you're
going to get everyone you love there.

1155
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:39,020
And then there's just this velvet rope
in front of Paradise and you're going to

1156
01:08:39,021 --> 01:08:42,260
walk right past cause the angel's
going to lift it up for you.

1157
01:08:42,261 --> 01:08:47,050
And the way to get there is to be a
jihadi. You know, it's, it's like a,

1158
01:08:47,051 --> 01:08:50,060
it's a, it's the ultimate.
It's like being James Bond,

1159
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:54,260
who's going to get 72 virgins
in paradise and you end,

1160
01:08:54,261 --> 01:08:57,150
you have got no other problems in life.
You need to worry about,

1161
01:08:57,170 --> 01:09:00,110
you don't have to worry about getting
education or getting a job or making it

1162
01:09:00,111 --> 01:09:02,240
work in this world are
building a civil society.

1163
01:09:02,570 --> 01:09:06,860
You just have to play
your side of the game,

1164
01:09:06,861 --> 01:09:10,700
right and die in the right circumstances.
But how many of those are there?

1165
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:14,450
How many? I think, I think there are
enough. Well, I think there are, I mean,

1166
01:09:14,451 --> 01:09:18,770
there are tens of thousands of people who
went to training camps in Afghanistan.

1167
01:09:19,310 --> 01:09:23,420
Um, so again, so, so concentric circles.

1168
01:09:23,421 --> 01:09:25,580
So the center of the bull's eye,
let's say that's just,

1169
01:09:27,140 --> 01:09:32,120
let's say that's half of a
percent of the Muslim world.

1170
01:09:32,570 --> 01:09:37,460
Okay. Which is the timing.
So when that, whenever you,
half a percent is a, you know,

1171
01:09:37,461 --> 01:09:40,640
a 1% of humanity is schizophrenia.
I mean, so half a percent.

1172
01:09:40,641 --> 01:09:45,020
It's a tiny segment of any, any
population. Th there's, there's,

1173
01:09:46,310 --> 01:09:51,020
there's no idea. So crazy that only half
a percent of Americans believe in it.

1174
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:54,770
If you ask people. Yeah. Yeah. So you're
going to get more than half a percent.

1175
01:09:54,771 --> 01:09:59,390
It's just it. So, but
even half a percent. Um,

1176
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:04,040
what does that, it's like,
you know, it's millions of,

1177
01:10:04,041 --> 01:10:09,041
of of people who are just the die hard
of the die hard now as 1.4 billion

1178
01:10:11,841 --> 01:10:15,380
Muslims. Um, so,

1179
01:10:15,410 --> 01:10:18,120
so you think it's possible that half
a percent of them? Oh No, I believe.

1180
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:20,480
I think so. I think it's for vogue
is worse because it's all, let's say,

1181
01:10:20,540 --> 01:10:22,880
so let's say there's,
there's potentially,

1182
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,280
let's say there's potentially
a million jihadis, right?

1183
01:10:25,550 --> 01:10:28,880
I think it's probably worse than that,
but let's say, yeah, let's just see.

1184
01:10:29,150 --> 01:10:32,010
Let's say it's you, but when you
see, just be defined it, you,

1185
01:10:32,011 --> 01:10:35,600
you mean guys who are willing to become
suicide bombers more than a million?

1186
01:10:36,410 --> 01:10:39,290
Well, I think that that wouldn't
be a crazy guest. I mean, I have,

1187
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:42,540
I have no way of knowing, apart
from the fact that, that you're,

1188
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:47,720
there's like in any and every
Muslim country, it's 10, 15,

1189
01:10:47,721 --> 01:10:51,950
20, 30, 40, 50, depending
on the country, up to 70%.

1190
01:10:52,220 --> 01:10:56,460
Who thinks suicide bombing is a good
thing. Wow. Right? So it's not the,

1191
01:10:56,480 --> 01:11:00,650
these are when you, when you run
the poll in, in, in, you know,

1192
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:05,030
which has been done by Pew
and other organizations and
you started asking people,

1193
01:11:05,031 --> 01:11:07,100
do you think you know, uh, uh,

1194
01:11:07,820 --> 01:11:12,820
suicide bombing in defense
of Islam is ever justifiable.

1195
01:11:13,170 --> 01:11:16,290
And, and then it's, you
know, yes, sometimes,

1196
01:11:16,860 --> 01:11:21,760
rarely and never are the
possible responses. The, the,

1197
01:11:21,770 --> 01:11:26,480
the number of yeses and sometimes
gives it gives you a, a,

1198
01:11:26,490 --> 01:11:31,290
if not a majority, a significant minority
of, of every Muslim country. Even in,

1199
01:11:31,291 --> 01:11:36,240
even in the UK, you would get
something like, you know, 20, 25% of,

1200
01:11:36,270 --> 01:11:36,571
of,

1201
01:11:36,571 --> 01:11:40,560
of young Muslims thinking that it's
justifiable and you'd get that immediately

1202
01:11:40,561 --> 01:11:44,200
after the suicide bombings
in London. These polls had
been run, you know, do you,

1203
01:11:44,201 --> 01:11:46,110
do you want to live under Sharia law?

1204
01:11:46,111 --> 01:11:49,440
You get like 30% in the UK among Muslims,

1205
01:11:49,441 --> 01:11:53,160
18 to 24 now. So, so one question is,

1206
01:11:53,310 --> 01:11:55,820
do people actually believe what
they say they believe when,

1207
01:11:55,821 --> 01:11:58,180
when you are taking a poll and,

1208
01:11:58,240 --> 01:12:00,300
and what does it actually
mean to say yes to that?

1209
01:12:00,301 --> 01:12:01,530
How does that inform your life?

1210
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:05,700
So let's just style it all the
way down to half a percent. Okay.

1211
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:10,820
Everyone else's just bluffing, half a
percent is still with the spread of, uh,

1212
01:12:10,821 --> 01:12:14,490
of weapons of, uh, of,
uh, high yield. You know,

1213
01:12:14,491 --> 01:12:19,260
whether it's nuclear weapons
or biological weapons,

1214
01:12:20,630 --> 01:12:25,360
um,
half a percent of any popular,

1215
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:29,400
any significant population, it can do
a lot of damage. And so we, we just,

1216
01:12:29,430 --> 01:12:33,300
it's something that we have to win a
war of ideas ultimately. And we have to,

1217
01:12:33,301 --> 01:12:38,301
we have to discredit these ideas so that
the next generation doesn't find it so

1218
01:12:39,661 --> 01:12:41,280
easy to believe these things.
But,

1219
01:12:41,580 --> 01:12:45,810
but how did they accept us?
How do they accept anything,

1220
01:12:45,811 --> 01:12:49,260
any real solution coming from us
when they know what we did in Iraq,

1221
01:12:49,261 --> 01:12:50,850
when they know what we did in Afghanistan,

1222
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,520
when they know what a fuckery
we've made out of the whole thing,

1223
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:55,890
when they know how much
rampant corruption there is,

1224
01:12:55,891 --> 01:12:57,690
when they know how much
missing money there is,

1225
01:12:57,900 --> 01:13:00,600
how do they ever look at this as
anything other than a money grab?

1226
01:13:00,750 --> 01:13:02,460
How do they ever look at it as like,
oh,

1227
01:13:02,461 --> 01:13:04,410
these are the Americans are
going to teach us how to live.

1228
01:13:04,860 --> 01:13:08,610
How could anybody except that? Well,
it's not, but when you look at, again,

1229
01:13:08,611 --> 01:13:10,710
it's just necessary.
It doesn't matter how the accepted,

1230
01:13:10,711 --> 01:13:13,020
we just have to do it anyway. When
you're talking about the center of the

1231
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:16,490
Bullseye, uh, these people
are truly on persuadable.

1232
01:13:16,550 --> 01:13:20,240
It says there was nothing we were going
to do that was going to get Osama bin

1233
01:13:20,240 --> 01:13:24,590
Ladin to say, you know, I had
you guys all wrong. This is,
you know, the eye. This is,

1234
01:13:24,620 --> 01:13:28,010
we're friends now and, and uh, um,

1235
01:13:29,470 --> 01:13:34,470
so I think a certain percentage of
people are on persuadable and they're the

1236
01:13:34,761 --> 01:13:38,090
force or the threat of force
is the only game to play.

1237
01:13:38,750 --> 01:13:43,750
And then what we have to do is win a war
of ideas around that first circle where

1238
01:13:46,070 --> 01:13:49,310
they become marginalized,
sufficiently marginalized and, and,

1239
01:13:49,311 --> 01:13:52,280
and not supported within
their society. So, so,

1240
01:13:52,281 --> 01:13:57,281
and that arguably that has
happened to some degree,

1241
01:13:57,860 --> 01:14:02,450
even with how chaotic
Afghanistan and Iraq,

1242
01:14:02,590 --> 01:14:03,423
uh,
look.

1243
01:14:03,490 --> 01:14:03,611
Well,

1244
01:14:03,611 --> 01:14:06,610
there's certainly been more penetration
than there was like 50 or 60 years ago,

1245
01:14:06,611 --> 01:14:11,611
but the majority of the population is
still like really deep into their culture.

1246
01:14:13,260 --> 01:14:14,820
I mean,
they have a weird setup.

1247
01:14:14,860 --> 01:14:17,380
They only have one city cobbles
the only real city. Right.

1248
01:14:17,590 --> 01:14:21,760
And Afghanistan has just filled with
like tribes, right? Essentially.

1249
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:25,970
Uh, yeah. Yeah. I mean, I, I haven't
been there, so I'm, again speaking,

1250
01:14:26,010 --> 01:14:28,330
I've only read third hand,
but a bunch of, yeah.

1251
01:14:29,150 --> 01:14:31,270
Mccain talk about it. Where he, I think,

1252
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:34,910
believe one of his quotes was that
it's run the same way as it was when

1253
01:14:34,911 --> 01:14:36,440
Alexander the Great was around.

1254
01:14:36,980 --> 01:14:40,880
Right. Just at the end,
some of that tribalism isn't
strictly a religious problem.

1255
01:14:40,881 --> 01:14:41,800
It's a, I mean, the toes,

1256
01:14:41,810 --> 01:14:46,010
tribalism is a problem and
religious tribalism is a
problem. And, and these are,

1257
01:14:46,011 --> 01:14:47,110
you know,
these are

1258
01:14:47,940 --> 01:14:48,773
mmm.

1259
01:14:48,970 --> 01:14:53,970
Any ideology that fundamentally divides
one group from another and prevents them

1260
01:14:54,041 --> 01:14:56,500
from recognizing their
common humanity as a problem.

1261
01:14:56,501 --> 01:14:59,500
And so not all of that's religious.
Some of its racist, some of it's tribal.

1262
01:15:00,050 --> 01:15:01,880
Um,
but

1263
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:07,220
the role that religion plays
in confounding this, uh, our,

1264
01:15:07,221 --> 01:15:11,210
our, our best intentions. Even so,
even, even if our, even if are,

1265
01:15:11,420 --> 01:15:14,300
we only had our best intentions and
they were not mingled with our worst

1266
01:15:14,301 --> 01:15:16,250
intentions,
even if it was not about if,

1267
01:15:16,290 --> 01:15:18,770
even if we would just go
into Rwanda to help people,

1268
01:15:19,070 --> 01:15:21,710
even though they don't have oil and
we got no national security interests,

1269
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:24,980
but they take out the machetes and start
killing their neighbors and we just,

1270
01:15:25,310 --> 01:15:28,190
we're going to put our lives on
the line to just stop the violence.

1271
01:15:29,240 --> 01:15:29,540
Okay.

1272
01:15:29,540 --> 01:15:32,530
It's the, the problem is, it's just this,

1273
01:15:32,620 --> 01:15:35,180
there's no elegant way to do it.

1274
01:15:35,390 --> 01:15:38,740
You wind up killing us and
people you wind up, uh,

1275
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:44,300
you can't, you can't commit enough
resources to build a civil society.

1276
01:15:44,301 --> 01:15:46,190
You can't,
it takes too long to,

1277
01:15:46,580 --> 01:15:51,470
to teach people what they should
want. You know? It's, it's just, it's,

1278
01:15:51,471 --> 01:15:52,304
um,

1279
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:56,670
so you sort of reconcile our problem. You
sort of reconcile our military actions.

1280
01:15:56,700 --> 01:15:58,440
You reconcile the corruption,
all the fuck.

1281
01:15:58,441 --> 01:16:00,930
I'd be saying all the
fuck ups that they are,

1282
01:16:00,931 --> 01:16:03,840
what they are and there's
nothing we can do about them now.

1283
01:16:03,841 --> 01:16:07,500
But what's important is we keep these
crazy people from developing nuclear bombs

1284
01:16:07,501 --> 01:16:11,920
and from attacking us cause they're,
they're very real possibility of,

1285
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:16,230
of nuclear terrorism to you is far more
important than whatever mistakes or

1286
01:16:16,231 --> 01:16:20,130
corruption has been, you know,
has, has that we've put out as a,

1287
01:16:20,131 --> 01:16:21,450
as a country that have gotten,

1288
01:16:21,540 --> 01:16:24,120
gotten these people to have
this sort of a perception of us.

1289
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:27,950
I think what, well, I can't, yeah,

1290
01:16:27,951 --> 01:16:32,420
I can't sign on to all of that because I
think our screw ups have been huge and,

1291
01:16:32,900 --> 01:16:34,430
and I think we,

1292
01:16:35,300 --> 01:16:40,300
we have a huge moral debt to all the
people we have accidentally blown up.

1293
01:16:42,141 --> 01:16:45,490
I mean obvious obviously collateral
damage is a huge problem. And,

1294
01:16:45,491 --> 01:16:46,550
and I think we are.

1295
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:48,153
MMM.

1296
01:16:49,450 --> 01:16:51,310
And it's been a problem in every
war we've ever fought. I mean,

1297
01:16:51,311 --> 01:16:54,790
one of the things we, we've now,
which is an advantage on the one hand,

1298
01:16:54,791 --> 01:16:58,270
but also disadvantages that
there's so much more transparency.

1299
01:16:58,271 --> 01:17:01,780
We know so much more
about the bad stuff we do.

1300
01:17:01,781 --> 01:17:03,550
Whether inadvertent or not,

1301
01:17:04,060 --> 01:17:08,860
that if we didn't know this in World
War II and more bombing Dresden and

1302
01:17:08,870 --> 01:17:12,660
incinerating hundreds of
thousands of people, um,

1303
01:17:13,470 --> 01:17:18,430
got an innocent bystanders for, for, for
the most part, um, and not, you know,

1304
01:17:18,431 --> 01:17:22,180
nonmilitary targets.
And we could know,

1305
01:17:23,540 --> 01:17:25,340
arguably we should never have done that,

1306
01:17:25,341 --> 01:17:28,500
but we've arguably couldn't do
that now given how much info given,

1307
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:33,230
given what the images would do to
us on the nightly news. And so, um,

1308
01:17:34,100 --> 01:17:35,750
and I think that's all to the good.
I think we should,

1309
01:17:35,780 --> 01:17:39,200
I think we should understand the cost
of war more than we do and we should

1310
01:17:39,201 --> 01:17:43,260
understand how horrible collateral
damages more than we do. Um, how,

1311
01:17:43,290 --> 01:17:48,050
how'd you feel about wikileaks?
Well, I think, I think,

1312
01:17:48,540 --> 01:17:52,490
uh, a song has just, it'd be
he's a cult of personality.

1313
01:17:52,491 --> 01:17:55,330
He's a creepy bastard. So it, so it's
hard. It's hard to, I mean, I, I'm,

1314
01:17:55,370 --> 01:17:58,400
I like transparency, I think, I think the,

1315
01:17:58,930 --> 01:18:02,720
the journalistic aspect of it
to some degree was legitimate,

1316
01:18:02,721 --> 01:18:06,250
but I think it's also, if
you're going to release, uh,

1317
01:18:08,070 --> 01:18:09,690
certain secrets shouldn't be released.

1318
01:18:09,691 --> 01:18:12,990
So there are certain secrets are there
because they're keeping people safe.

1319
01:18:13,050 --> 01:18:15,570
And to release those secrets,
uh,

1320
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:19,920
irresponsibly is to put people in
harm's way. And so it, so I, it was a,

1321
01:18:19,921 --> 01:18:21,740
it's a very mixed,
hey,

1322
01:18:21,741 --> 01:18:24,980
do you feel about the initial video
that he released collateral murder,

1323
01:18:24,990 --> 01:18:28,260
the one that showed the guys and the
helicopters shooting the people on the

1324
01:18:28,261 --> 01:18:31,340
ground? Yeah. Well, children
and them saying, well,

1325
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:33,750
I shouldn't have brought their
kids. Right, right. Well,

1326
01:18:34,230 --> 01:18:38,760
the thing that's horrible
about that is the, the, um,

1327
01:18:40,590 --> 01:18:41,423
horrible but,

1328
01:18:41,430 --> 01:18:45,660
but maybe inevitable is
that we're just not wired to

1329
01:18:46,770 --> 01:18:47,310
okay.

1330
01:18:47,310 --> 01:18:52,310
And understand the consequences of our
actions once we can fight war remotely.

1331
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:56,470
You know, I mean, you have a, if we were
just fighting every, if it was all just,

1332
01:18:56,471 --> 01:19:00,910
you know, bayonets, there's a,
there's the kind of the, in a,

1333
01:19:00,911 --> 01:19:05,500
in escape ability of the horror of war.
But the moment you can fly something,

1334
01:19:05,550 --> 01:19:06,610
you're sitting in your,

1335
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:11,470
in your office park and outside of Las
Vegas and you're flying a Predator drone,

1336
01:19:11,471 --> 01:19:16,380
or if 13,000 miles away, um, it's, uh, I,

1337
01:19:16,420 --> 01:19:17,350
I'm,
I'm not this,

1338
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:20,800
I'm not suggesting those guys don't
have a hard time sleeping at night,

1339
01:19:20,801 --> 01:19:23,860
some of them, but it's a very
different kind of violence. And,

1340
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:28,920
and one of the scariest things about
technology is it uncouples us from our,

1341
01:19:31,521 --> 01:19:34,610
our emotions, from, um,

1342
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:38,860
the reality of the consequences of our
actions so that the most harmful things

1343
01:19:38,861 --> 01:19:41,920
aren't actually the most disturbing
things, you know, so, so,

1344
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:45,430
so if you miss an example,
actually I used in, um,

1345
01:19:46,180 --> 01:19:47,690
I think the end of faith know,

1346
01:19:48,050 --> 01:19:53,050
if you hear that your grandfather fought
in World War II and he dropped bombs.

1347
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:57,340
He was a fight. He was a, he was a bomber
pilot. He dropped bombs over Dresden.

1348
01:19:58,510 --> 01:20:02,830
That's one kind of level of abstraction
of a, of his actions that it's,

1349
01:20:02,850 --> 01:20:06,700
it doesn't really disturb you about him.
And it needed to have disturbed him.

1350
01:20:06,701 --> 01:20:10,770
And he's, he's at 30,000 feet dropping
bombs, not really getting what he's doing.

1351
01:20:10,771 --> 01:20:15,150
But if you hear grandad killed a
woman and her kids with a shovel,

1352
01:20:15,990 --> 01:20:18,570
all of a sudden he is the
scariest guy who ever heard of.

1353
01:20:18,571 --> 01:20:22,210
And probably he's couldn't sleep for
the rest of his life either because it

1354
01:20:22,220 --> 01:20:25,200
takes a very different
kind of person to do that.

1355
01:20:25,890 --> 01:20:30,360
But the guy dropping bombs killed farm
any more women and children than the guy

1356
01:20:30,361 --> 01:20:34,260
with a shovel. And, and,
and so, so that, that um,

1357
01:20:34,710 --> 01:20:37,980
it's fascinating isn't it? And then
now we're moving into drones. Yeah.

1358
01:20:37,981 --> 01:20:39,900
And she'll lose even more.
So we need,

1359
01:20:40,710 --> 01:20:45,710
the burden is to figure out how to have
an appropriate emotional response to

1360
01:20:49,110 --> 01:20:53,610
reality and to be guided by, it's not
to say that our emotions are always the,

1361
01:20:53,700 --> 01:20:57,810
the, um, uh, perfect
guide. I mean there, there,

1362
01:20:57,811 --> 01:21:02,811
there may be ways in which we are wired
to have a strong response to something

1363
01:21:03,631 --> 01:21:06,090
that we should just get over.
And,

1364
01:21:06,091 --> 01:21:10,080
and we're not wired to have
an appropriately emotional
response to something

1365
01:21:10,081 --> 01:21:12,480
that really is, is a massive danger. And,

1366
01:21:12,481 --> 01:21:17,430
and so our perception of risk and our
perception of harm is not what it needs to

1367
01:21:17,431 --> 01:21:22,370
be for us to, to, to make intelligent
decisions and compassionate decisions in,

1368
01:21:22,371 --> 01:21:23,700
in these kinds of conflicts.

1369
01:21:23,730 --> 01:21:27,060
Did you agree with the video being
released? Did you think it was a bad idea?

1370
01:21:28,850 --> 01:21:31,550
Um,
for morale for,

1371
01:21:32,300 --> 01:21:35,150
it's hard to separate that from
everything else that that has happened.

1372
01:21:35,151 --> 01:21:39,290
But as far as wikileaks you mean? Yeah.
Yeah. So, I mean, I think wikileaks,

1373
01:21:39,291 --> 01:21:42,590
I truth is, I don't even know the ultimate
consequences of wikileaks. I, you know,

1374
01:21:42,591 --> 01:21:45,500
it's, it would just, it would just
matter what the consequences are.

1375
01:21:45,550 --> 01:21:49,910
There isn't transparency. Good.
Yeah. But to a certain point,

1376
01:21:49,940 --> 01:21:54,940
but do I think Obama should be forced at
his next press conference to just share

1377
01:21:55,341 --> 01:21:59,350
his White House briefing with
the world? No, I think he,

1378
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:00,380
I think he,

1379
01:22:00,730 --> 01:22:05,390
there are certain things that I understand
that he and people like him need to

1380
01:22:05,391 --> 01:22:09,890
know that I don't need to know. And
if, if I knew and blogged about it,

1381
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:14,630
I would be harming our national
security. Um, so, so yeah, no,

1382
01:22:14,650 --> 01:22:19,140
I'm not for the just unlimited
distribution of secrets. Yeah.

1383
01:22:19,220 --> 01:22:20,053
Yeah.

1384
01:22:20,740 --> 01:22:24,730
So you allow them to have certain
secrets just for national security. Well,

1385
01:22:24,731 --> 01:22:29,470
it's just a clearly we absolutely
need that. We would be paralyzed.

1386
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:32,950
I agree with that. To what your sure.
Absolutely. Right. If there's bad guys,

1387
01:22:33,160 --> 01:22:36,700
but to what level? Like at what point,
how do you know that's where it's weird.

1388
01:22:36,701 --> 01:22:39,660
How do you make the distinction? How
do you decide that, uh, you know,

1389
01:22:39,670 --> 01:22:42,090
they shouldn't be able to have,
you know,

1390
01:22:42,100 --> 01:22:46,330
a certain secrets that may in fact be
damaging to American civilians or meet,

1391
01:22:46,331 --> 01:22:47,730
we might disagree with it.

1392
01:22:47,731 --> 01:22:51,520
It might change the way we feel
about a president or our policy.

1393
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:53,850
It's probably not that
complicated. I don't think so. No.

1394
01:22:53,900 --> 01:22:56,230
It's probably pretty basic.
It's probably like, all right,

1395
01:22:56,231 --> 01:22:58,540
we should definitely not
tell him about our, uh,

1396
01:22:58,541 --> 01:23:02,560
where nuclear warheads
throughout the United States
are located everywhere. Yeah.

1397
01:23:02,561 --> 01:23:04,810
You would think so. But I think there's
a lot more complicated than that.

1398
01:23:06,350 --> 01:23:07,330
Yeah. Well, again,

1399
01:23:07,540 --> 01:23:11,140
there are trade offs between some of
these things where it's just there,

1400
01:23:11,141 --> 01:23:16,090
it's hard to really be satisfied that
you've hit the right answer because it's,

1401
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:19,060
it's the cell,
for instance,

1402
01:23:19,061 --> 01:23:22,960
going through security and in the
airport there's this issue of fairness,

1403
01:23:22,980 --> 01:23:26,260
you know, and there's this
issue of intelligent uses,

1404
01:23:26,290 --> 01:23:31,090
use of attentional resources. So the
fairness would say, yes. Fris Frisk,

1405
01:23:31,091 --> 01:23:36,040
the 75 year old woman who looks like she
just got out of her evangelical church

1406
01:23:36,430 --> 01:23:39,510
just as much as you frisk the guy who,

1407
01:23:39,540 --> 01:23:43,520
who just prayed on his knees to Mecca,
um,

1408
01:23:43,570 --> 01:23:45,100
before passing through security.

1409
01:23:46,390 --> 01:23:49,510
It's only fair to be blind to those,
uh,

1410
01:23:50,260 --> 01:23:53,340
otherwise salient
differences between them. Um,

1411
01:23:53,890 --> 01:23:58,780
but it's stupid to when you know that the
person who is going to blow himself up

1412
01:23:58,781 --> 01:24:03,730
on the plane is a jihadi and not a,
an ordinary looking old woman.

1413
01:24:04,180 --> 01:24:07,390
Um,
so again,

1414
01:24:07,391 --> 01:24:11,680
you see what are the consequences
of being starkly unfair? You know,

1415
01:24:11,681 --> 01:24:16,330
where you just profile nakedly and say
yes without apology. We profile if you,

1416
01:24:16,331 --> 01:24:17,101
if you're Muslim,

1417
01:24:17,101 --> 01:24:22,000
we are going to subject you to a heroin
search at the airport because we're

1418
01:24:22,001 --> 01:24:26,980
worried about your brothers. Um, we, we,

1419
01:24:26,981 --> 01:24:28,060
we have to find a balance.

1420
01:24:28,330 --> 01:24:32,010
We're struggling to find a balance
between those two things. And, um,

1421
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:36,910
I think we,
we're in the current environment.

1422
01:24:36,911 --> 01:24:41,140
I think we're wise to err on
the side of being fair. And,

1423
01:24:41,340 --> 01:24:44,290
and I mean, I think, and I
think you would, you would,

1424
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:48,070
you would want us to err in that direction
to be fair and to be transparent and

1425
01:24:48,071 --> 01:24:52,030
to be, but that's what's so scary
about something like nuclear terrorism.

1426
01:24:52,031 --> 01:24:56,230
One thing has to happen
and all of a sudden are,

1427
01:24:56,290 --> 01:25:01,290
we'll all be desperate for a level of
security that will radically transform our

1428
01:25:01,811 --> 01:25:04,690
lives. And it's so, and it will be, again,

1429
01:25:04,691 --> 01:25:09,230
it could be completely out of scale with
the actual damage. So you know, if you,

1430
01:25:09,260 --> 01:25:13,840
if a new queen off in Los Angeles
and killed 100,000 people,

1431
01:25:14,530 --> 01:25:18,030
right? So a small nuke until 100,000
people and rendered, you know,

1432
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:20,350
some area uninhabitable for Awhile.

1433
01:25:21,730 --> 01:25:23,110
That would be such a,

1434
01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:28,500
a rattling event that it w we would all
be demanding huge changes and we would

1435
01:25:30,851 --> 01:25:32,740
be forfeit in our civil liberties.

1436
01:25:32,980 --> 01:25:37,810
Happily it with both hands as was
clearly evident after nine, 11,

1437
01:25:37,900 --> 01:25:38,740
after nine 11.
Right?

1438
01:25:39,490 --> 01:25:44,110
This would be orders of magnitude worse
and yet it would be rational to say,

1439
01:25:44,140 --> 01:25:48,220
well listen, you know, 400,000 people
died of heart disease last year, you know,

1440
01:25:48,221 --> 01:25:52,900
no one is forfeit in their civil
liberties are going nuts over that figure.

1441
01:25:53,410 --> 01:25:56,920
We're talking about a hundred thousand
people, uh, who, who, you know, what,

1442
01:25:56,921 --> 01:25:59,020
what is the real risk we're talking about?
Well,

1443
01:25:59,021 --> 01:26:02,920
there's this sudden death over
[inaudible] self administered death.

1444
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:04,460
Even if that would be

1445
01:26:05,370 --> 01:26:05,890
okay,

1446
01:26:05,890 --> 01:26:09,250
even if we, uh, I'm not saying
that's the right way to look at it,

1447
01:26:09,251 --> 01:26:14,251
but even if you could show a commensurate
body count from [inaudible] from some

1448
01:26:14,771 --> 01:26:19,360
other source, um, actually bill morrow
wants made this point where, um,

1449
01:26:20,350 --> 01:26:22,540
I think he was talking about Hurricane
Katrina. I say, well, look at,

1450
01:26:22,541 --> 01:26:25,440
look at what happened with Hurricane
Katrina and the billions of dollars in,

1451
01:26:25,570 --> 01:26:30,190
in cost and a thousand lives lost.
If a terrorist had done this,

1452
01:26:30,370 --> 01:26:34,510
we would, we would completely freak out
as a nation because it's the weather.

1453
01:26:34,570 --> 01:26:38,890
We basically can't get our act together
and, and don't really worry about it.

1454
01:26:39,340 --> 01:26:40,173
Um,

1455
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:40,710
okay.

1456
01:26:40,710 --> 01:26:44,160
That difference in response is uh,

1457
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:45,820
okay,

1458
01:26:45,820 --> 01:26:48,770
well something we have to be cognizant of.
And so one reason,

1459
01:26:48,771 --> 01:26:50,420
one rational reason to Pete to,

1460
01:26:50,750 --> 01:26:54,020
to want to protect against certain,

1461
01:26:54,230 --> 01:26:59,230
especially salient events like
nuclear terrorism is because

1462
01:26:59,910 --> 01:27:00,190
okay,

1463
01:27:00,190 --> 01:27:03,690
we are guaranteed to overreact
in such a way that it,

1464
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:07,510
the consequences will be a horrendous,
I mean,

1465
01:27:07,511 --> 01:27:10,390
just economically consequences.
That's a very good point.

1466
01:27:10,391 --> 01:27:14,080
So your point is cut back
on civil liberties so that
we don't have to cut back

1467
01:27:14,081 --> 01:27:17,530
on in the future when the shit hits the
fan to some degree. That's an argument.

1468
01:27:17,540 --> 01:27:21,550
You're not, yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, but, but cut back on them.

1469
01:27:22,270 --> 01:27:25,420
And again, I wouldn't phrase it in terms
of cutting back on civil liberties, but,

1470
01:27:25,421 --> 01:27:26,800
but I,

1471
01:27:28,050 --> 01:27:28,883
yeah,

1472
01:27:28,950 --> 01:27:32,250
it comes back to, to, to moments
like airport security. For me,

1473
01:27:32,251 --> 01:27:35,580
it's like how much security do I
want when I get on an airplane?

1474
01:27:36,030 --> 01:27:40,470
I want intelligence security
now intelligent. I want,
I also want fairness, but,

1475
01:27:41,070 --> 01:27:45,050
and I'm willing to put up with
a certain level of, of, um,

1476
01:27:45,880 --> 01:27:50,370
inconvenience to, to, to, to know
that basically this is being done.

1477
01:27:50,371 --> 01:27:53,550
Sanely now do I want huge inconvenience?

1478
01:27:53,551 --> 01:27:56,800
Do I want to be bombarded with
rays? Do I want to, you know,

1479
01:27:56,940 --> 01:28:01,350
I'd want to have take my clothes off
every time I got on a plane. No, but, um,

1480
01:28:02,070 --> 01:28:06,370
it's just, you just, we
have, as a society, we, eh,

1481
01:28:07,170 --> 01:28:11,760
there's something very corrosive
about the, the signs that,

1482
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:13,633
okay,

1483
01:28:13,640 --> 01:28:17,150
these efforts are ineffectual and
not being done intelligently. I mean,

1484
01:28:17,450 --> 01:28:20,010
if we could all just see,
uh,

1485
01:28:20,011 --> 01:28:24,380
an airport security protocol
that just looked right, you know,

1486
01:28:24,381 --> 01:28:25,880
where it's just,
you know,

1487
01:28:26,230 --> 01:28:29,450
then I think everyone would
understand why we had to do it,

1488
01:28:29,451 --> 01:28:33,500
but it looks so wrong and
it feels so wrong. Uh, and

1489
01:28:34,410 --> 01:28:34,680
okay.

1490
01:28:34,680 --> 01:28:36,500
It doesn't feel like it's improving.

1491
01:28:36,530 --> 01:28:40,400
It's just like there's figuring out the
system better and this is an easier way

1492
01:28:40,401 --> 01:28:43,310
to do it. Less intrusive.
There's no easier way to do it.

1493
01:28:43,370 --> 01:28:47,690
And I'm not even putting myself, it's
like I'm not, you know, fine. You know,

1494
01:28:47,691 --> 01:28:52,610
I don't actually, look, I don't think I
look like I'm al Qaeda, but, but I don't,

1495
01:28:52,611 --> 01:28:55,390
look, I, I'm not as benign a, I mean,

1496
01:28:55,430 --> 01:29:00,110
I once saw a little girl when
this, when we first got the, the,

1497
01:29:00,111 --> 01:29:04,560
the shoe bomber effect and a, we were
all having to take off our shoes. Um,

1498
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:09,550
I saw, you know, I saw a three year
old girl in her, you know, whatever,

1499
01:29:09,551 --> 01:29:10,291
whatever those,

1500
01:29:10,291 --> 01:29:15,291
I'm one of those black and white shoes
that little girls were called jellies,

1501
01:29:16,020 --> 01:29:19,080
bugs. I don't know. There's some
little older school name. Anyway,

1502
01:29:19,081 --> 01:29:23,610
she was like holding up a line. Her, she
was being forced to take her shoes off.

1503
01:29:23,611 --> 01:29:26,220
She was terrified. It's like
a first flight, you know,

1504
01:29:26,221 --> 01:29:28,320
and like the parents were being
traumatized and it was just,

1505
01:29:28,680 --> 01:29:33,480
it was just the most insane, insane,
misapplication of, of human resources.

1506
01:29:33,930 --> 01:29:34,763
Um,

1507
01:29:34,770 --> 01:29:39,720
and meanwhile that was a flight where
I had accidentally taken, uh, a,

1508
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:44,960
a bag that I used to keep a gun in
and I went through security with,

1509
01:29:45,570 --> 01:29:50,490
with a double hand, a handful of
bullets just inadvertently. Right. So I,

1510
01:29:50,491 --> 01:29:54,780
so I'm getting through with bullets
and they're looking at, at this girl,

1511
01:29:54,781 --> 01:29:58,420
like she's, you know,
the, uh, she's Okaydo.

1512
01:29:58,510 --> 01:30:01,950
So of course Al Gore got frisked.
Do you remember that? No,

1513
01:30:01,951 --> 01:30:06,080
but Al Gore made a big deal out of it
cause he was flying commercial and right

1514
01:30:06,180 --> 01:30:10,190
on, I'm one of these flights and he got,
he got frisked. I was like, what does,

1515
01:30:10,240 --> 01:30:15,090
that's not symbolic
demonstration of fairness. Yeah.

1516
01:30:15,420 --> 01:30:18,650
Yeah. It is. I guess at a certain
point in time that you got to come on,

1517
01:30:18,660 --> 01:30:19,620
you think the ex president,

1518
01:30:19,621 --> 01:30:22,740
the x vice president is going to
become a suicide bomber was really,

1519
01:30:22,741 --> 01:30:24,390
is that what we're looking
at here? Yeah. Yeah.

1520
01:30:24,460 --> 01:30:29,210
So that it's that kind of thing that I
think is, is corrosive. And, and, uh, the,

1521
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:30,113
the,

1522
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:34,710
the missteps and failures we've had
at the level of foreign policy and in

1523
01:30:34,711 --> 01:30:37,040
fighting wars have been
corrosive for the same reason.

1524
01:30:37,041 --> 01:30:39,420
It's just the ineptitude and the,
and the,

1525
01:30:39,900 --> 01:30:44,900
the [inaudible] acknowledged and
unanticipated costs and it's all just,

1526
01:30:45,270 --> 01:30:46,800
um, yeah, it's,

1527
01:30:46,801 --> 01:30:51,450
it's very hard to be idealistic or feel
like anything is being done right. But

1528
01:30:53,160 --> 01:30:53,640
again,

1529
01:30:53,640 --> 01:30:58,640
think of just what Obama's got to deal
with when he drinks his first cup of

1530
01:30:58,951 --> 01:31:00,630
coffee in the morning and he's got,
he,

1531
01:31:00,830 --> 01:31:05,340
they're getting information
from a world of intelligence,

1532
01:31:05,341 --> 01:31:08,820
which is, is, is struggling
to quantify certain risks.

1533
01:31:08,850 --> 01:31:13,850
And there is no question that there
are people who are desperate to blow up

1534
01:31:15,331 --> 01:31:20,331
whole cities in this country because not
because they have said they have a long

1535
01:31:21,271 --> 01:31:24,120
list of rational grievances
against our foreign policy,

1536
01:31:24,121 --> 01:31:28,740
but because they're fighting a cosmic war.
And that's just,

1537
01:31:29,580 --> 01:31:34,580
that's just something we have to
absorb as bizarre fact s as it is.

1538
01:31:34,740 --> 01:31:39,120
So you think for most people it's almost
impossible to sort of understand their

1539
01:31:39,121 --> 01:31:41,730
mindset,
to really put yourself into their shoes.

1540
01:31:41,940 --> 01:31:46,800
It's virtually impossible to really have
that kind of a crazed, I don't, well,

1541
01:31:46,801 --> 01:31:50,080
I didn't mind it actually. I feel like
I can put myself in their shoes. I,

1542
01:31:50,081 --> 01:31:55,080
you know, if I read the Koran and I read
the Hud eighth and I read what, what, um,

1543
01:31:56,100 --> 01:31:59,220
people like Osama bin Ladin
say about their intentions,

1544
01:31:59,350 --> 01:32:01,480
what and why they're doing what
they're doing. You Watch enough,

1545
01:32:01,540 --> 01:32:05,620
you watch a few suicide
videos, um, you know,

1546
01:32:05,621 --> 01:32:08,410
last testament videos of,
of suicide bombers.

1547
01:32:10,690 --> 01:32:14,680
You just have to imagine what it would
be like if you really believed that this

1548
01:32:14,681 --> 01:32:19,120
was the structure of the universe
where this human life that we,

1549
01:32:19,300 --> 01:32:24,300
that people like us
really value is just this,

1550
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:30,160
uh, irredeemable fallen, uh,

1551
01:32:30,940 --> 01:32:34,920
uh,
really revolting circumstance of,

1552
01:32:34,980 --> 01:32:37,630
of separation from God.

1553
01:32:38,050 --> 01:32:42,720
And it's just this anti room
to the better place that,

1554
01:32:42,820 --> 01:32:47,290
that you get into if you live this
way and die at the, in the right way,

1555
01:32:47,291 --> 01:32:48,850
at the right time.
And

1556
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:55,560
eternity awaits Aternity where all the
good people get get to be happy forever.

1557
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:58,600
Wait, now why would you
want to stick around here?

1558
01:32:59,890 --> 01:33:02,920
I have to talk about this more,
but I also have to pee.

1559
01:33:03,160 --> 01:33:06,170
So what I'm gonna do is I'm going to put
my headphones down and I'm going to ask

1560
01:33:06,171 --> 01:33:09,190
you about question when we
get back though. How the
fuck does anything get fixed?

1561
01:33:09,250 --> 01:33:13,030
How do we fix this? If you were the
grand social engineer of the universe,

1562
01:33:13,060 --> 01:33:17,410
think about that. I
will follow you. So now,

1563
01:33:17,411 --> 01:33:20,140
but now what do we do while you Pete.
Okay.

1564
01:33:20,420 --> 01:33:25,160
Hey, how's it going? Sorry,

1565
01:33:25,161 --> 01:33:26,530
I'm just readjusting everything.

1566
01:33:28,170 --> 01:33:28,940
Okay.

1567
01:33:28,940 --> 01:33:33,860
Um, so is this something that
you fell into? Like did you, uh,

1568
01:33:34,040 --> 01:33:38,180
like think like this growing up or did
you have somebody that inspired your,

1569
01:33:38,181 --> 01:33:41,840
your, your beliefs in the way that you,
that you think and like your, your,

1570
01:33:41,841 --> 01:33:45,010
I guess your stance on
everything, you know, or did,

1571
01:33:45,380 --> 01:33:49,100
have you always been interested in it or,

1572
01:33:49,160 --> 01:33:52,010
well, I've always been,
I've been interested in, um,

1573
01:33:53,580 --> 01:33:54,413
okay.

1574
01:33:54,430 --> 01:33:56,400
Religious experience, right? I mean, why,

1575
01:33:56,650 --> 01:34:00,820
just what it means for people personally.

1576
01:34:00,821 --> 01:34:04,180
And just what the possibilities are. You
as a, as a teenager, I just, you know,

1577
01:34:04,181 --> 01:34:07,390
I was as interested in just what is,
you know,

1578
01:34:07,570 --> 01:34:11,260
what are the limits of reality as
anyone else. And so to some degree,

1579
01:34:11,261 --> 01:34:15,670
my research there has been scientific
and now increasingly scientific.

1580
01:34:15,671 --> 01:34:20,510
But early on I just, I was interested
in religion as a possible account of,

1581
01:34:20,540 --> 01:34:24,250
of what's true. And, um,

1582
01:34:25,150 --> 01:34:28,840
I was also interested in the kinds
of experiences that the founders of,

1583
01:34:28,930 --> 01:34:31,840
of the world's religions have
had or seemed to have had.

1584
01:34:31,841 --> 01:34:36,841
So I'm interested in the
kind of experience that
would get Jesus talking like

1585
01:34:37,481 --> 01:34:40,970
Jesus or Buddha talking like Buddha and,
and I,

1586
01:34:41,170 --> 01:34:46,070
I've sought those experiences with
drugs and meditation and, and um,

1587
01:34:46,990 --> 01:34:47,890
it's very,
it's clear,

1588
01:34:48,010 --> 01:34:52,480
absolutely clear to me that there is a
range of experience there that is hugely

1589
01:34:52,481 --> 01:34:57,481
motivating and real and accessible and
has been traditionally described only in

1590
01:34:59,721 --> 01:35:04,340
religious language and seems to
cash out the crazy claims of,

1591
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,100
of the various religions.
So like, so if you're,

1592
01:35:07,101 --> 01:35:11,810
if you're a devout Muslim and you start
having the kinds of experiences that

1593
01:35:12,350 --> 01:35:17,350
we've had on acid or the that that
people have had intensive meditation

1594
01:35:17,571 --> 01:35:18,960
retreats,
um,

1595
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:23,390
they get framed in very
much in doc trinal ways.

1596
01:35:23,391 --> 01:35:28,391
So it seems to justify your
infatuation with this one revelation,

1597
01:35:30,110 --> 01:35:32,630
a revelation which is
intrinsically divisive,

1598
01:35:32,631 --> 01:35:37,070
which argues that you should hate
everyone who's not in the fold.

1599
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:38,353
Um,

1600
01:35:38,660 --> 01:35:43,370
so clearly we need a way of talking about
these kinds of experiences and valuing

1601
01:35:43,371 --> 01:35:45,740
them that is,
which is,

1602
01:35:45,860 --> 01:35:49,480
which is just as generalizable
and scalable as uh, the, the,

1603
01:35:49,510 --> 01:35:50,840
the larger conversation of,

1604
01:35:50,841 --> 01:35:55,580
of reason and science based thinking
about the nature of reality and is not in

1605
01:35:55,581 --> 01:35:57,800
print and therefore it's
not in principle divisive.

1606
01:35:58,900 --> 01:36:01,930
One of the things that Mckenna always
said in describing the difference between

1607
01:36:01,931 --> 01:36:05,050
religion and a psychedelic experiences
that the psychedelic experience,

1608
01:36:05,051 --> 01:36:08,740
you don't have to believe
anything to go on it and you'll,

1609
01:36:08,770 --> 01:36:10,870
you're going to experience it
whether you like it or not,

1610
01:36:11,110 --> 01:36:12,130
you're going to get hit by it.

1611
01:36:12,160 --> 01:36:14,830
How you interpret it and how you
disseminate it inside your own head.

1612
01:36:14,831 --> 01:36:15,341
It's one thing,

1613
01:36:15,341 --> 01:36:18,700
but it's not like a religious experience
in that you don't have to believe.

1614
01:36:19,240 --> 01:36:21,710
Oh yeah. Which is probably the
beauty of it because you know,

1615
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:23,920
the ego wants you to hold back to all in.

1616
01:36:23,930 --> 01:36:28,270
You can retain all control of your
faculties at any given time. And you know,

1617
01:36:28,271 --> 01:36:31,480
you don't want to relinquish control
to some sort of a foreign substance,

1618
01:36:31,481 --> 01:36:32,291
some sort of a drug,

1619
01:36:32,291 --> 01:36:34,840
some sort of a thing that you know you're
going to give up your whole body and

1620
01:36:34,841 --> 01:36:37,840
your mind for three hours.
Fuck that. That's too long.

1621
01:36:37,841 --> 01:36:39,760
And that if that freaks people out,
yeah,

1622
01:36:40,310 --> 01:36:44,700
it freaks me out. It freaks people
out with good reason because there is,

1623
01:36:44,740 --> 01:36:49,740
there is a chaos factor to psychedelics,
which you don't get doing yoga now.

1624
01:36:49,741 --> 01:36:53,850
I mean that's, that's, that's their power
and their, their peril. Because the,

1625
01:36:54,260 --> 01:36:58,890
I mean, the other thing that Mckenna
said, um, which is obviously quite true,

1626
01:36:59,100 --> 01:37:01,950
which is that if you teach someone to
meditate or you're teaching them to do

1627
01:37:01,951 --> 01:37:03,010
yoga,
or you teach them to,

1628
01:37:03,120 --> 01:37:08,120
you tell them to do whatever spiritual
discipline you think is so potent

1629
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:14,100
based on their talents are
based on their happenstance or,

1630
01:37:14,101 --> 01:37:18,740
or nothing might happen. I mean they,
they, they just might get bored. They,

1631
01:37:18,760 --> 01:37:21,690
it doesn't matter if they
do it for an hour or a week,

1632
01:37:22,230 --> 01:37:24,420
it's not necessarily gonna move them.

1633
01:37:24,510 --> 01:37:28,020
But if you give them a
hundred micrograms of LSD or,

1634
01:37:28,050 --> 01:37:32,940
or a sufficient dose of
anything in that family, um,

1635
01:37:34,050 --> 01:37:36,600
there is just no question
something's going to happen. Now,

1636
01:37:36,690 --> 01:37:39,840
it could be very pleasant. It could
be very unpleasant. It could be mixed,

1637
01:37:39,841 --> 01:37:40,950
but there is,

1638
01:37:41,010 --> 01:37:46,010
there's going to be a break with their
ordinary consensus trance of egoity and

1639
01:37:48,550 --> 01:37:51,510
um, so it's a short cute,
so it's a huge shortcut.

1640
01:37:51,511 --> 01:37:54,900
But the problem is it does just
sort of just puts you in a,

1641
01:37:55,650 --> 01:37:59,070
and you're not quite sure where
it's pointed and then you're, it's,

1642
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:00,340
you're going there.

1643
01:38:00,340 --> 01:38:01,151
So it's a method.

1644
01:38:01,151 --> 01:38:04,780
But you think that a meditation
is probably an equally
effective method if you,

1645
01:38:04,840 --> 01:38:06,910
if you really follow it
through. I mean, I think,

1646
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:10,170
I think of meditation the same way I
think of martial arts. You know, I could,

1647
01:38:10,240 --> 01:38:12,430
I could teach you a spinning wheel kick,

1648
01:38:12,460 --> 01:38:16,420
I could show you it and you might
not ever be able to do it right. You,

1649
01:38:16,430 --> 01:38:19,090
you might not have the flexibility,
the coordination,

1650
01:38:19,091 --> 01:38:22,600
whether it's mental flexibility might
not be able to focus on it enough or be

1651
01:38:22,601 --> 01:38:24,300
intense enough or spending,

1652
01:38:24,370 --> 01:38:27,010
you'd be disciplined enough to stretch
yourself enough to pull something off.

1653
01:38:27,190 --> 01:38:29,980
But you can't say that another
person can't pull it off.

1654
01:38:29,981 --> 01:38:32,830
It is possible to pull it off.
It's possible to be an expert at it.

1655
01:38:33,040 --> 01:38:35,500
But now to all the people
that you teach this, you know,

1656
01:38:35,501 --> 01:38:38,980
like couldn't Bellini or some intense
form of meditation where you achieve

1657
01:38:38,981 --> 01:38:42,670
altered states of consciousness, how
many people are going to have the focus,

1658
01:38:42,671 --> 01:38:44,080
the drive,
the discipline,

1659
01:38:44,230 --> 01:38:47,410
how many people are going to put in the
time and the numbers to actually pull

1660
01:38:47,411 --> 01:38:49,960
off an altered state?
I have never done it.

1661
01:38:50,320 --> 01:38:51,970
Well,
uh,

1662
01:38:54,210 --> 01:38:57,270
I completely agree with that,
except there's one caveat,

1663
01:38:57,271 --> 01:39:02,190
which is I think that the center of the
Bullseye of altered states of meditation

1664
01:39:02,220 --> 01:39:05,540
is not so altered. It's
not, it's actually the, the,

1665
01:39:05,541 --> 01:39:09,270
the thing that you want to realize from a,

1666
01:39:09,300 --> 01:39:10,890
from a contemporary point of view

1667
01:39:12,690 --> 01:39:17,690
is not actually the same as the full
kaleidoscope of effects you get from

1668
01:39:20,791 --> 01:39:25,770
psychedelics. It's not just, and this
is a distinction I made, I think, again,

1669
01:39:25,771 --> 01:39:29,160
in the end of faith between, um, uh,

1670
01:39:29,580 --> 01:39:34,580
the content of consciousness and realizing
a specific property of the nature of

1671
01:39:35,041 --> 01:39:38,130
consciousness. And there's
no question that, that,

1672
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:43,290
that cause for ordinary waking
consciousness, like the content,

1673
01:39:43,560 --> 01:39:46,950
the spectrum of content is, is trimmed
down. I mean, we have, you know,

1674
01:39:46,951 --> 01:39:50,430
there's just a kind of a feeling of it's
because it's all solid and it's just me

1675
01:39:50,431 --> 01:39:53,250
here in my body, I'm kind of locked
in my head and see you over there.

1676
01:39:53,251 --> 01:39:57,870
And now there's no, the, the, the,
the energy of the situation is,

1677
01:39:57,871 --> 01:40:01,980
is, is quite, um, limited. Uh, yeah. And,

1678
01:40:01,981 --> 01:40:04,320
and they're not too many surprises.
I mean,

1679
01:40:04,350 --> 01:40:09,120
we have all kind of been
taught neurologically to
just perceive or ourselves in

1680
01:40:09,121 --> 01:40:13,800
the world. You give someone
LSD or psilocybin or Mescalin,

1681
01:40:13,801 --> 01:40:18,030
and that begins to change radically.

1682
01:40:18,031 --> 01:40:20,880
And it changes for everyone.
And it can be terrifying.

1683
01:40:20,881 --> 01:40:24,440
It can be incredibly blissful. Um, eh,

1684
01:40:24,630 --> 01:40:29,610
but what happens is people are flooded
with new content and new feelings of

1685
01:40:29,611 --> 01:40:33,150
meaning a new field and new, uh, um,

1686
01:40:33,720 --> 01:40:35,730
just the energetics change.
So will they tell you,

1687
01:40:35,731 --> 01:40:39,790
put your hand on a tree and
you feel like the buzz of,

1688
01:40:39,820 --> 01:40:44,040
of kind of living in contact with a tree
and which you have never felt in your

1689
01:40:44,041 --> 01:40:44,874
life.

1690
01:40:46,830 --> 01:40:47,663
Okay.

1691
01:40:47,710 --> 01:40:49,010
All of that kind of,

1692
01:40:49,080 --> 01:40:54,080
the more aspect that you get with
psychedelics isn't what isn't the point of

1693
01:40:55,421 --> 01:40:58,180
meditation.
And it comes with meditation.

1694
01:40:58,181 --> 01:41:02,500
So if you go on a three month retreat
where you're just meditating 18 hours a

1695
01:41:02,501 --> 01:41:06,670
day, and every time your
mind gets lost in thought,

1696
01:41:06,671 --> 01:41:09,430
you'd come back to the practice,
whether it's, you know, mindfulness,

1697
01:41:09,431 --> 01:41:11,590
you're like the Pos and the
meditation or whatever it is.

1698
01:41:11,591 --> 01:41:14,740
It could be yoga that,
you know,

1699
01:41:14,890 --> 01:41:19,000
being in a pressure cooker of intensive
retreat can give you that some

1700
01:41:19,001 --> 01:41:21,490
experience of more,
I've never quite had it.

1701
01:41:21,491 --> 01:41:24,610
Like what you get in a psychedelic
experience, how close we've become.

1702
01:41:26,110 --> 01:41:26,943
MMM.

1703
01:41:27,650 --> 01:41:29,430
Well it's not, it's not the, um,

1704
01:41:30,530 --> 01:41:35,360
you can certainly get what you get with
MDM may, I mean the like the full blown,

1705
01:41:35,361 --> 01:41:39,800
empathic, unconditional love
real thing happened. Yeah.

1706
01:41:40,520 --> 01:41:44,240
Oh yeah. Yeah. Wow. Um, and they're
actually practicing within Buddhism.

1707
01:41:44,241 --> 01:41:47,660
There are practices that
are just tuned to that.

1708
01:41:47,661 --> 01:41:51,560
So the practice of loving
kindness called Metta in Pali,

1709
01:41:52,310 --> 01:41:55,960
it's just, you're just, you're just
trying to stoke that emotion and it,

1710
01:41:56,020 --> 01:41:59,590
you're just, you're just thinking, it's,
it's, it's a very simple practice you,

1711
01:42:00,470 --> 01:42:04,640
you bring to mind, people you love.
You're not, not romantic love,

1712
01:42:04,641 --> 01:42:07,310
but just people who you just,
you know, your best friend say,

1713
01:42:07,910 --> 01:42:11,770
and you just meditate on that person
and you just think, Eh, you know,

1714
01:42:12,330 --> 01:42:15,530
thoughts of well wishing for them
to see it as you. May you be happy.

1715
01:42:15,531 --> 01:42:17,480
May you be free from
suffering May and just,

1716
01:42:17,481 --> 01:42:20,360
and just connect with your wish
for that person's happiness.

1717
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:25,610
And you just train that up. The crucial
piece is once you get concentrated,

1718
01:42:25,611 --> 01:42:30,080
once your mind is no longer
wandering into the, into the, um,

1719
01:42:31,100 --> 01:42:35,360
into the chatter of just distraction
and you can actually focus,

1720
01:42:36,050 --> 01:42:40,190
you get the feeling going and you
can focus on the actual practice,

1721
01:42:40,970 --> 01:42:45,390
then you can do it. Then it would just
be, it gets kindled and then you're,

1722
01:42:45,391 --> 01:42:49,270
you're feeling very much
what you, you feel, uh, uh,

1723
01:42:49,370 --> 01:42:51,020
on ecstasy where there's just this,

1724
01:42:51,730 --> 01:42:52,563
mmm,

1725
01:42:54,400 --> 01:42:56,290
it'd be it, it becomes, it becomes like,

1726
01:42:56,320 --> 01:43:00,370
like ecstasy the moment you move it off
because you start with someone who's

1727
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:03,970
very easy to love, like your
best friend. Um, and then,

1728
01:43:05,080 --> 01:43:05,641
then the,

1729
01:43:05,641 --> 01:43:08,740
the practice evolves and then you move
it to a neutral person and then you even

1730
01:43:08,741 --> 01:43:11,800
move into an enemy. Um, and so,
and then so then you get it.

1731
01:43:11,860 --> 01:43:15,490
Then it's just broad spectrum.
You know, three 60, I love,

1732
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:20,530
I wish everyone happiness. That's the
goal of the practice and, and but,

1733
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:25,560
but wishing with a totally focused
mine that is not lost in thought.

1734
01:43:26,340 --> 01:43:27,350
Uh,
it,

1735
01:43:27,580 --> 01:43:32,580
I mean the truth is just
having a concentrated mind
that's not getting lost in

1736
01:43:33,101 --> 01:43:36,940
thought is just intrinsically pleasurable.

1737
01:43:36,970 --> 01:43:39,970
It's intrinsically blissful.
It's sort of, it's like the,

1738
01:43:40,230 --> 01:43:45,100
the emotional base note of
all the good drug experiences.

1739
01:43:46,090 --> 01:43:47,710
It's like, it's sort of kind of the, the,

1740
01:43:47,711 --> 01:43:52,711
the opiate happy feeling
comes just with concentration.

1741
01:43:52,970 --> 01:43:54,410
It doesn't even matter what
you're concentrated on.

1742
01:43:54,411 --> 01:43:55,970
If you're just concentrated on a,

1743
01:43:56,540 --> 01:44:01,540
my Buddhists do practices where they'll
just focus on a colored disk and they,

1744
01:44:02,990 --> 01:44:05,090
they reach levels of concentration was,

1745
01:44:05,091 --> 01:44:09,110
so you're just focusing on a
piece of a swatch of red and

1746
01:44:10,880 --> 01:44:12,860
you're, you're, you're,

1747
01:44:12,920 --> 01:44:17,510
you're reaching states of consciousness
that are just extraordinarily blissful

1748
01:44:18,440 --> 01:44:21,410
and, and, but again, that's
not, that's not the ultimate,

1749
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:25,220
it's not the ultimate point of meditation
and constant concentration is just a

1750
01:44:25,221 --> 01:44:30,221
tool to use to actually glimpse something
about the nature of consciousness.

1751
01:44:30,711 --> 01:44:34,160
And so that, this comes back to
what I was saying before, that the,

1752
01:44:34,161 --> 01:44:36,380
that the actual goal,
and this is,

1753
01:44:36,410 --> 01:44:39,920
this is a difference between
just getting more content and,

1754
01:44:40,010 --> 01:44:43,520
and getting the kind of the
wisdom that comes with, with, um,

1755
01:44:43,550 --> 01:44:45,050
recognizing something about consciousness.

1756
01:44:45,890 --> 01:44:50,890
The goal is to recognize that ordinary
consciousness without anything getting

1757
01:44:51,771 --> 01:44:56,690
psychedelic is a circumstance
of genuine freedom.

1758
01:44:57,050 --> 01:44:58,020
That the,
that the,

1759
01:44:58,021 --> 01:45:03,021
the sense of being a neurotic
self locked in the head,

1760
01:45:04,370 --> 01:45:05,030
uh,

1761
01:45:05,030 --> 01:45:10,030
worried about what other people are
thinking that can be cut through fully so

1762
01:45:12,021 --> 01:45:13,400
that it's, it's just gone. I mean,

1763
01:45:13,401 --> 01:45:17,450
so that you can recognize the intrinsic
selflessness of consciousness and that

1764
01:45:17,451 --> 01:45:21,320
can happen without any of the
pyrotechnics. It can happen without the,

1765
01:45:21,380 --> 01:45:25,670
the rush of energy in the body.
It can happen without the colors changing.

1766
01:45:25,710 --> 01:45:26,360
It can happen.

1767
01:45:26,360 --> 01:45:31,360
It happened without any luminosity of
any kind of says you don't feel like

1768
01:45:31,911 --> 01:45:35,990
you've taken a drug. You're,
you're, you're, you're,

1769
01:45:35,991 --> 01:45:39,460
you're awareness is crystal
clear. It's, it's, it's,

1770
01:45:39,530 --> 01:45:43,430
it's compatible with ordinary
behavior. You can drive a car. You can,

1771
01:45:43,431 --> 01:45:47,330
if someone says, can you pass the salt?
You don't, you're not this dazzled,

1772
01:45:47,331 --> 01:45:50,360
stoned person who can't find the salt you,
you're,

1773
01:45:50,361 --> 01:45:55,361
you're fully here and integrated and
yet the center has dropped out of

1774
01:45:55,791 --> 01:45:57,680
experience and you can just,

1775
01:45:58,250 --> 01:46:03,250
only the world remains in some sense
and you're no longer on this side of it.

1776
01:46:03,940 --> 01:46:04,391
Look,

1777
01:46:04,391 --> 01:46:09,391
assessing personally or even just
even that the sense of subject,

1778
01:46:09,681 --> 01:46:13,820
object perception and even just, it's
like there's, there's a way of looking at,

1779
01:46:13,821 --> 01:46:18,821
you take any object and there's a way of
looking at it as an object where I feel

1780
01:46:20,391 --> 01:46:25,391
like I'm over here looking at it and then
there's also a way of still seeing it.

1781
01:46:28,220 --> 01:46:30,320
But Lou scene,

1782
01:46:30,321 --> 01:46:33,770
it's so clearly that you're no longer,

1783
01:46:33,920 --> 01:46:35,720
you're no longer the sear,

1784
01:46:35,780 --> 01:46:40,220
you're no longer the law on the outside
or the on the inside looking out.

1785
01:46:40,550 --> 01:46:44,540
There's just seen, there's
just a totality. If this is
some karate kid type shit,

1786
01:46:44,541 --> 01:46:48,410
you're like become the cap. That's
what, no, no, it's not becoming the cab.

1787
01:46:48,411 --> 01:46:51,780
It's just become, the world becomes
come. Whatever you focus on,

1788
01:46:51,781 --> 01:46:56,781
yet it becomes become the church become
re most of us feel like we are having an

1789
01:46:57,751 --> 01:47:00,090
experience. Like there's,
there's our experience,

1790
01:47:00,091 --> 01:47:01,560
there's the world of our experience,

1791
01:47:02,100 --> 01:47:04,980
and then there's us over here
having the experience, you know,

1792
01:47:04,981 --> 01:47:09,680
like we're on the outside looking in or
we're looking over our own shoulder. Uh,

1793
01:47:10,030 --> 01:47:11,820
there's a distance,
there's a subject,

1794
01:47:11,821 --> 01:47:15,750
and then there's all the objects and
it's possible to collapse that distance.

1795
01:47:16,740 --> 01:47:18,330
You know,
in a way that is,

1796
01:47:18,360 --> 01:47:22,830
doesn't require any psychedelic explosion.

1797
01:47:23,970 --> 01:47:28,710
And that is the, from a meditational
point of view, that that is,

1798
01:47:29,400 --> 01:47:31,450
that's the center of the
bolt side that you want to,

1799
01:47:31,470 --> 01:47:34,800
you want to find that intrinsic
property of consciousness.

1800
01:47:35,400 --> 01:47:37,380
And then you meditate on
that and then you just,

1801
01:47:37,381 --> 01:47:39,300
you drop your distraction and you fall,

1802
01:47:39,301 --> 01:47:43,660
you fall back into that space
of just being open and aware.

1803
01:47:43,710 --> 01:47:45,120
And then it doesn't
matter what happens then.

1804
01:47:45,121 --> 01:47:47,850
It doesn't matter whether you
feel blessed or you don't,

1805
01:47:48,360 --> 01:47:50,250
you're not waiting for the
meditation and get good.

1806
01:47:50,251 --> 01:47:55,251
You're not trying to have an experience
that you had yesterday that you know

1807
01:47:55,620 --> 01:47:57,270
that you lost and you're
trying to get back to it.

1808
01:47:57,271 --> 01:47:58,980
I mean that's also all of the seeking,

1809
01:47:59,640 --> 01:48:02,640
the tends to come and people's spiritual
lives where they're just trying to get

1810
01:48:02,660 --> 01:48:07,120
some place. That's the
irony is you know, the,

1811
01:48:07,130 --> 01:48:08,850
the seeking is your problem,
you know,

1812
01:48:08,851 --> 01:48:13,851
see you trying to become happy trying
to positing a goal and then seeking it.

1813
01:48:16,850 --> 01:48:21,630
Uh, from a, from a contemplative point of
view, is the trap that you want to avoid?

1814
01:48:21,910 --> 01:48:25,380
You mean as far as like behavior is
concerned? I mean, as far as, I mean,

1815
01:48:25,381 --> 01:48:28,920
you don't mean that as far as like
goal setting in life, right? No, no.

1816
01:48:28,980 --> 01:48:29,660
I mean there's,

1817
01:48:29,660 --> 01:48:32,790
there's certainly a place for goal setting
and how do you have this attitude and

1818
01:48:32,791 --> 01:48:35,490
still write your book? No, no, I mean it
was it possible. Yeah. No, no I'm not,

1819
01:48:35,491 --> 01:48:39,630
I'm not, I'm not nullifying all
purpose based behavior obviously, but,

1820
01:48:39,660 --> 01:48:41,520
but from a contemplative point of view,
like,

1821
01:48:41,521 --> 01:48:46,521
so the question is what is available to
realize now in the present moment that

1822
01:48:49,261 --> 01:48:52,290
is liberating. It's like what?
So, so it's just, just me.

1823
01:48:52,320 --> 01:48:56,430
Neurotic may unhappy me,
me who's disappointed with yesterday.

1824
01:48:56,790 --> 01:49:00,960
What can I do right now to be free?

1825
01:49:02,580 --> 01:49:06,840
Is that even possible? Does that he,
does that question even make any sense?

1826
01:49:06,841 --> 01:49:10,740
Now some people would say,
well, that doesn't make any
sense. You know, there is no,

1827
01:49:10,920 --> 01:49:11,271
there isn't.

1828
01:49:11,271 --> 01:49:16,020
You are just a monkey or you're just an
ape with various needs and desires and,

1829
01:49:16,080 --> 01:49:19,500
and you can be as happy as you can be,
but there's just,

1830
01:49:19,530 --> 01:49:24,530
there's nothing really profound to be
realized about the nature of consciousness

1831
01:49:24,690 --> 01:49:25,523
in the present.

1832
01:49:26,100 --> 01:49:30,840
There's just you think believing in
certain things, wanting certain things,

1833
01:49:30,960 --> 01:49:34,140
etc. And that's just not true.

1834
01:49:34,290 --> 01:49:37,860
Now it's completely rational that many
people think it's true because they

1835
01:49:37,861 --> 01:49:42,120
haven't had certain kinds of
experiences. But, but the truth is that,

1836
01:49:42,570 --> 01:49:43,081
and this,

1837
01:49:43,081 --> 01:49:48,081
this is a truth that that inconveniently
for our sake is only really ever

1838
01:49:49,571 --> 01:49:51,280
acknowledged in the context of religion.

1839
01:49:52,210 --> 01:49:55,300
The truth is there actually is something
more profound to realize about the

1840
01:49:55,301 --> 01:50:00,301
present moment and you get one look
at that truth through the psychedelic

1841
01:50:02,291 --> 01:50:07,291
experience because it's just you being
neurotic and someone hands you a tab of

1842
01:50:07,841 --> 01:50:12,841
acid and all of a sudden you are
a wash in an ocean of new content.

1843
01:50:13,480 --> 01:50:17,500
That is, is completely
profound. And, and I mean,

1844
01:50:17,620 --> 01:50:22,210
you've had no idea. Life
could be so rich, rich.

1845
01:50:22,240 --> 01:50:25,950
Now if you have a bad experience,
you have,

1846
01:50:25,970 --> 01:50:28,390
but you have a bad experience and that's,
that's something else.

1847
01:50:28,391 --> 01:50:31,810
But if you have a good psychedelic
experience where you feel like Jesus

1848
01:50:33,400 --> 01:50:38,400
that proves to you that
is possible to be much,

1849
01:50:38,740 --> 01:50:43,690
much deeper and happier and fulfilled
than you, then you realized.

1850
01:50:43,980 --> 01:50:48,240
I read that you had had a very similar
experience, uh, to me, uh, when you,

1851
01:50:48,270 --> 01:50:51,540
the first time you did a
Mtma [inaudible] and, um,

1852
01:50:51,880 --> 01:50:56,100
that was a real behavior
changing experience for me.

1853
01:50:56,460 --> 01:51:00,660
And I remember the, when I
did it, I really couldn't,

1854
01:51:00,900 --> 01:51:02,790
couldn't stop thinking after it was over.
Like,

1855
01:51:02,791 --> 01:51:04,710
why can't people be
like that all the time?

1856
01:51:04,711 --> 01:51:08,010
What an incredible world it would be if
people thought like that all the time.

1857
01:51:08,011 --> 01:51:11,370
It would, anything ever get done,
I don't know. But, you know, boy,

1858
01:51:11,400 --> 01:51:13,920
human interaction would
be blissful all the time.

1859
01:51:14,940 --> 01:51:17,850
Yeah, no, I mean, and again,

1860
01:51:17,851 --> 01:51:21,570
I keep feeling just a
civic responsibility to,

1861
01:51:21,630 --> 01:51:26,270
to bracket all of my um,
uh,

1862
01:51:26,280 --> 01:51:31,280
enthusiasm for psychedelics with
the warning that I think they're,

1863
01:51:31,590 --> 01:51:34,980
some of them are more just biochemically,
more risky,

1864
01:51:34,981 --> 01:51:38,250
are riskier than others and some are
just psychologically risky and it's

1865
01:51:38,251 --> 01:51:41,530
possible to have a bad experience and
to really regret taking any of these

1866
01:51:41,531 --> 01:51:42,200
frozen.

1867
01:51:42,200 --> 01:51:44,120
Well if you have a hard time with reality,

1868
01:51:44,121 --> 01:51:46,220
I say stay the fuck
away from psychedelics,

1869
01:51:46,360 --> 01:51:50,740
but he, but even if you don't, or even if
you've had nothing but good experiences,

1870
01:51:51,010 --> 01:51:54,430
you can suddenly start having
bad experiences. I mean,
that was my course I took,

1871
01:51:54,460 --> 01:51:57,550
I took em to Mtma a few times.

1872
01:51:57,551 --> 01:52:01,240
I took silicide been a few
times. I took acid, you know,

1873
01:52:01,241 --> 01:52:05,530
a dozen times or so.
And I had for the most part,

1874
01:52:05,531 --> 01:52:08,200
just especially with with Lsd,

1875
01:52:08,980 --> 01:52:13,980
I had 10 perfect experiences
where afterwards it was just,

1876
01:52:15,430 --> 01:52:17,770
it was unthinkable to me that
anyone ever had a bad trip.

1877
01:52:17,771 --> 01:52:22,771
I didn't even know what that couldn't
even see the direction you would head to

1878
01:52:23,621 --> 01:52:24,440
have a bad trip.

1879
01:52:24,440 --> 01:52:27,290
Did anything change in your life
before you had the bad trip?

1880
01:52:27,890 --> 01:52:32,230
I don't, I don't, I don't know what
the approximate, cause it's insecure,

1881
01:52:32,730 --> 01:52:37,470
but it's just,
but then I think this is,

1882
01:52:37,550 --> 01:52:39,380
I don't know,
I don't have any science to go on here,

1883
01:52:39,381 --> 01:52:43,850
but anecdotally I think
this is a reasonably common
experience where once you've

1884
01:52:43,851 --> 01:52:48,470
had a bad trip, then the door is
slightly ajar there and you can,

1885
01:52:48,500 --> 01:52:52,790
you can, you know, you see, you can find
your way there in a way, kind of reliably.

1886
01:52:53,270 --> 01:52:58,070
Um, so I, I approach psychedelics
with more caution now and I,

1887
01:52:58,071 --> 01:53:00,890
you know, it's been years since
I've, I've done anything. Um,

1888
01:53:01,040 --> 01:53:03,560
but it's not that I wouldn't,
it's not that I wouldn't do it again.

1889
01:53:03,640 --> 01:53:08,320
I probably would, but I would just, I
would pick my moment wisely because I,

1890
01:53:08,321 --> 01:53:13,070
you know, as good as the good trips
were, the bad trips were just as bad.

1891
01:53:13,071 --> 01:53:14,600
And, and it's, um,

1892
01:53:14,860 --> 01:53:18,910
so the legal situation is very
unfortunate because if it was legal,

1893
01:53:19,090 --> 01:53:23,230
then we can have people that were experts
on it that were professionals and they

1894
01:53:23,231 --> 01:53:25,960
could distribute it and they could do
it properly into the right environment.

1895
01:53:25,961 --> 01:53:29,250
And we'd have, you know,
protocol and, and, and the,

1896
01:53:29,251 --> 01:53:32,110
the correct things to do if someone is
having a bad trip and they're in the,

1897
01:53:32,111 --> 01:53:32,351
you know,

1898
01:53:32,351 --> 01:53:35,680
the safety and comfort of professionals
and people that can let them know that

1899
01:53:35,681 --> 01:53:38,900
everything's gonna be fine and sort of
steer it in one way or another. You know,

1900
01:53:38,950 --> 01:53:43,370
that's all something, the, the, the
potential growth experiences, we're,

1901
01:53:43,380 --> 01:53:46,390
we're all missing out on those
because of the illegality of it.

1902
01:53:46,600 --> 01:53:50,110
But I agree with you that you should
be really careful, but anything you do,

1903
01:53:50,111 --> 01:53:53,890
especially, I know people
that they just, you know,

1904
01:53:53,891 --> 01:53:56,170
they get on Xanax and they
lose their mind. You know,

1905
01:53:56,171 --> 01:53:59,500
I know people that just things that
seem to be mild and acceptable.

1906
01:53:59,530 --> 01:54:01,600
I know people can't drink.
You know, that every,

1907
01:54:01,601 --> 01:54:04,510
everyone's mind is very
different biochemically,

1908
01:54:04,511 --> 01:54:08,360
the way it reacts to two
different substances. You
know, some people can't smile.

1909
01:54:08,361 --> 01:54:09,790
I've,
we were talking about this before.

1910
01:54:09,830 --> 01:54:12,940
I know people that have given them pot
and they swear there's something in it.

1911
01:54:12,941 --> 01:54:16,580
They, well this is not pot. This
is, you're drugging me. And so, no,

1912
01:54:16,600 --> 01:54:19,960
it's just pot man. It's just, you're,
you're, you're set ups different.

1913
01:54:19,990 --> 01:54:23,250
There's a certain amount of immunity
that I've developed that you,

1914
01:54:23,251 --> 01:54:26,130
you don't have tolerance
rather. Right. Um,

1915
01:54:26,200 --> 01:54:30,010
I think it's really unfortunate though
that we can't experiment with these

1916
01:54:30,011 --> 01:54:33,460
things if they aren't like, uh, you know,
at a university level. But this isn't like

1917
01:54:33,870 --> 01:54:38,020
normal people are quietly doing research
on basically everything now I think.

1918
01:54:38,021 --> 01:54:38,860
I think,
uh,

1919
01:54:40,080 --> 01:54:43,410
I don't know if there's anything that
you can't do research with at the moment,

1920
01:54:43,411 --> 01:54:47,400
but it all is pretty quiet. But they're
doing an MDA research. And actually the,

1921
01:54:47,430 --> 01:54:48,670
um,
I'd,

1922
01:54:48,740 --> 01:54:53,130
that I was at Ted and someone
who's somewhat close to
this research told me that

1923
01:54:53,131 --> 01:54:53,964
the,

1924
01:54:54,150 --> 01:54:59,150
they've been having such success with
two sessions of Mtma therapy for PTSD,

1925
01:55:00,001 --> 01:55:00,530
that the,

1926
01:55:00,530 --> 01:55:05,340
that the military is now looking
at it using MDA for Mgma for,

1927
01:55:05,341 --> 01:55:08,820
um, yeah, I'd heard about the two or
like two or three sessions protocol,

1928
01:55:08,821 --> 01:55:12,180
which sort of,
I think the jury is still out on the,

1929
01:55:12,210 --> 01:55:16,720
the neuro toxicity of Mtma. I
think it's, I mean, this, there,

1930
01:55:16,770 --> 01:55:18,780
there've been studies
on, on, on both sides,

1931
01:55:18,781 --> 01:55:23,781
but if it's just two sessions and you
get some huge response rate for PTSD,

1932
01:55:25,920 --> 01:55:27,550
um,
and that,

1933
01:55:27,590 --> 01:55:30,360
that's where it gets around the neuro
toxicity questioned because it's not,

1934
01:55:30,361 --> 01:55:35,361
it's not so toxic that you can't do it a
few times or even a few more times than

1935
01:55:35,611 --> 01:55:39,860
that. Um, but yeah, so, so anyway, I,

1936
01:55:39,870 --> 01:55:40,740
I'm not a

1937
01:55:43,530 --> 01:55:48,530
psychedelics or we're truly indispensable
for me at a certain time in my life in

1938
01:55:48,961 --> 01:55:49,794
terms of just,

1939
01:55:49,860 --> 01:55:54,860
I was so I was a hard enough case and
skeptical enough that there was anything

1940
01:55:55,111 --> 01:56:00,111
worth realizing through introspection
that it took just getting hurled over the

1941
01:56:03,751 --> 01:56:08,730
wall for me to realize that there was any,
any more to the world. And, and, and so,

1942
01:56:08,740 --> 01:56:13,620
and, and then that gave me a basis
from which to practice meditation and,

1943
01:56:13,621 --> 01:56:14,760
and kind of look into these things.

1944
01:56:14,840 --> 01:56:17,630
What do you think is happening
in the psychedelic experience?

1945
01:56:17,631 --> 01:56:21,290
I've heard the broad spectrum of,
you know,

1946
01:56:21,291 --> 01:56:24,690
you're just changing the brain chemistry.

1947
01:56:24,691 --> 01:56:28,130
You're adding in and add a different
element that creates hallucinations.

1948
01:56:28,131 --> 01:56:30,410
And because those hallucinations,
you know,

1949
01:56:30,411 --> 01:56:33,620
you get these profound feelings and you
can learn and grow from those feelings

1950
01:56:33,650 --> 01:56:38,570
too. It's a radio and you're tuning into
another life form that only communicates

1951
01:56:38,571 --> 01:56:40,580
with you through eating it.
It's from another planet.

1952
01:56:40,581 --> 01:56:42,020
And that's why there's a logos.

1953
01:56:42,200 --> 01:56:45,380
That's why when you take especially
high doses of mushrooms there,

1954
01:56:45,381 --> 01:56:47,930
you'll have people, community,
you'll have a language,

1955
01:56:47,931 --> 01:56:50,540
whether it's internal or not, you don't
really know. I mean, it could all be,

1956
01:56:50,960 --> 01:56:55,070
you know, how much of w if you
can see any of that stuff. I mean,

1957
01:56:55,071 --> 01:57:00,020
how much of that is just firing against
the different parts of your brain that

1958
01:57:00,021 --> 01:57:01,730
causes, uh, causes visions? I mean,

1959
01:57:01,880 --> 01:57:04,250
what do you think is happening
in a psychedelic experience?

1960
01:57:04,330 --> 01:57:07,740
Well, let's say, so I blogged
about this. I wrote an article, a

1961
01:57:09,580 --> 01:57:12,370
drug, drugs in the
meaning of life. And, um,

1962
01:57:13,780 --> 01:57:18,300
and so I, I'm in a footnote,
I differentiated those two

1963
01:57:20,110 --> 01:57:22,690
kinds of psychedelic experience
because there is this,

1964
01:57:22,720 --> 01:57:27,640
there is the one experience
which is, um, again,

1965
01:57:28,240 --> 01:57:30,670
personal,
even if it's even if it's trans personal,

1966
01:57:30,700 --> 01:57:35,470
it doesn't put you in dialogue
with anything else or it
doesn't seem to put you

1967
01:57:35,471 --> 01:57:39,820
in dialogue with anything else. Um,
and that's the only kind I've ever had.

1968
01:57:39,821 --> 01:57:43,190
I've never had the
experience where you're, um,

1969
01:57:43,450 --> 01:57:48,120
the Terence Mckenna style on now in
the presence of the other talking and

1970
01:57:48,130 --> 01:57:49,960
receiving information that,

1971
01:57:50,380 --> 01:57:53,410
that I couldn't have had it
any other way or it could,

1972
01:57:53,411 --> 01:57:55,490
don't think I could have
had any other way. So the,

1973
01:57:55,580 --> 01:58:00,030
so for people who have had that
experience, it seems rational to say that,

1974
01:58:00,160 --> 01:58:04,930
that it's putting you in touch with and
other, in some sense, it's not just you,

1975
01:58:04,931 --> 01:58:09,931
it's not just an expanded you or just
the universe without you be without your

1976
01:58:09,941 --> 01:58:12,970
ego involved.
It's actually

1977
01:58:14,620 --> 01:58:19,180
putting somebody else's attention on you
and now you're in dialog. Now that's,

1978
01:58:19,600 --> 01:58:22,440
cause that's an experience I haven't had.
And so I can't really that,

1979
01:58:22,870 --> 01:58:26,470
but the thing is that the test of
the validity of that experience,

1980
01:58:27,220 --> 01:58:28,750
it's pretty straight
forward. I mean, if you're,

1981
01:58:28,751 --> 01:58:32,350
if you're getting information that
you couldn't have any other way,

1982
01:58:33,010 --> 01:58:37,810
that should be provable. And one of
the things, one of the, the, the, um,

1983
01:58:38,980 --> 01:58:41,140
the fishy things about
Terence has account of,

1984
01:58:41,141 --> 01:58:45,120
of these states is that at many
moment he claimed to be getting,

1985
01:58:45,160 --> 01:58:50,160
he really did claim to have a compelling
experience of being in dialogue with

1986
01:58:52,570 --> 01:58:55,270
kind of omniscient other, you
know, so he would, there was,

1987
01:58:55,330 --> 01:58:57,640
I don't know if you read his book
true hallucinations. So He's,

1988
01:58:58,240 --> 01:59:01,910
he's in the Amazon and he's walking
around and he's, he's had more, um,

1989
01:59:02,440 --> 01:59:05,260
mushrooms than, than any
person in human history. And,

1990
01:59:05,830 --> 01:59:10,360
and he is in dialogue with,
with,

1991
01:59:10,510 --> 01:59:14,740
um, it's a very, very readable book,

1992
01:59:14,741 --> 01:59:19,400
very fun read. Um, some very, uh,
out there ideas in there. And,

1993
01:59:19,401 --> 01:59:21,880
and so I'm going to summarize,
I'm going to,

1994
01:59:21,881 --> 01:59:26,290
I'm going to falsify by summarizing what
he was claiming to be in dialogue with,

1995
01:59:26,291 --> 01:59:29,190
but he's in dialogue with
some Omnish and other, um,

1996
01:59:30,700 --> 01:59:34,240
and it's just so he's pointing to a
species of plant that he doesn't know the

1997
01:59:34,241 --> 01:59:37,760
name of his cube. Terrence was very, had
a lot of botanical knowledge, but he,

1998
01:59:38,030 --> 01:59:38,560
his point,

1999
01:59:38,560 --> 01:59:41,740
his point of plants that he doesn't know
the name of and he claimed he's just

2000
01:59:41,741 --> 01:59:46,741
getting the Latin name in his head
beam to him by the other right now.

2001
01:59:47,440 --> 01:59:50,500
That would be a, he, he,

2002
01:59:51,250 --> 01:59:52,870
it's been a little while since
I looked at the book. But

2003
01:59:54,700 --> 01:59:56,140
if you're of a scientific frame of mind,

2004
01:59:56,141 --> 02:00:00,400
you actually want to establish whether
this is more than just your experience.

2005
02:00:00,970 --> 02:00:03,640
That's the kind of thing that you, it's
very testable. I mean, you could say,

2006
02:00:03,641 --> 02:00:04,600
listen, I had, you know,

2007
02:00:04,601 --> 02:00:09,250
I didn't know any of these plants and I've
never taken a course in botany or get,

2008
02:00:09,280 --> 02:00:12,610
I'm going to give the same dose to someone
who I really does know what I really

2009
02:00:12,611 --> 02:00:14,020
know.
It doesn't know a damn thing about botany.

2010
02:00:14,350 --> 02:00:18,190
And we're going to see how many of
these species of plants he can name. Um,

2011
02:00:19,210 --> 02:00:21,290
and that's just, I mean
that would be, it's, it's a,

2012
02:00:21,300 --> 02:00:24,850
it's as easy as testing psychic
phenomenon and an ordinary sense.

2013
02:00:24,910 --> 02:00:28,630
And if you could attach it
is scientifically, if you
could just get information,

2014
02:00:28,631 --> 02:00:31,390
one unique experience though. I mean, but,

2015
02:00:31,391 --> 02:00:35,950
but it's just a member of
any of those names. He, yeah,

2016
02:00:35,951 --> 02:00:40,770
he didn't so, so Tara,
Tara's was so smart. Um,

2017
02:00:41,290 --> 02:00:44,680
but he,
you know,

2018
02:00:44,681 --> 02:00:47,970
he was not the most rigorous,
uh,

2019
02:00:47,980 --> 02:00:52,270
at the margins of his rap on
what is real, you know, he was,

2020
02:00:52,271 --> 02:00:55,150
he was more poet than
scientists when he would,

2021
02:00:55,330 --> 02:00:59,260
when he would get to some of
these crucial moments. And so, um,

2022
02:01:00,160 --> 02:01:00,371
yeah,

2023
02:01:00,371 --> 02:01:05,371
I haven't seen in his work any
effort to be really rigorous and say,

2024
02:01:08,170 --> 02:01:08,531
okay,

2025
02:01:08,531 --> 02:01:13,531
I had this experience where I was getting
information that I know was not my own

2026
02:01:13,661 --> 02:01:17,170
content. It was not based
on prior learning and it was
not just merely imagined.

2027
02:01:17,171 --> 02:01:18,190
It was real information.

2028
02:01:18,610 --> 02:01:21,310
And here is how I went about
trying to authenticate that, that,

2029
02:01:21,340 --> 02:01:25,270
that it was real information because he
talks about just being able to close his

2030
02:01:25,271 --> 02:01:29,110
eyes and see, not, I
mean alien civilizations,

2031
02:01:29,111 --> 02:01:31,550
obviously that's hard to authenticate,
but you know,

2032
02:01:31,600 --> 02:01:36,550
see historical periods and see,
um, he said, yeah, yeah, no. Yeah.

2033
02:01:36,551 --> 02:01:40,410
So he was, he would, you know,
because Evan, it wasn't some of his,

2034
02:01:40,700 --> 02:01:45,190
some of his talks. Oh, he's probably high
as fuck. Yeah. So, so obviously it's,

2035
02:01:45,191 --> 02:01:49,070
it's possible to be completely stoned
and have these wild experiences that are

2036
02:01:49,071 --> 02:01:53,300
basically just dreams right
now or hypnogogic images and,

2037
02:01:54,160 --> 02:01:57,290
um, unless you can bring back those
Latin names. Yeah. If you can't,

2038
02:01:57,291 --> 02:01:59,930
if you can't bring back something
that's clearly information,

2039
02:02:00,260 --> 02:02:03,860
then my feeling is there's no
reason to claim that it is.

2040
02:02:03,861 --> 02:02:08,470
You can claim that this is the one thing
that what's indisputable is that people,

2041
02:02:08,640 --> 02:02:13,640
people can have a range of experience
that is incredibly beautiful and life

2042
02:02:15,621 --> 02:02:16,454
changing.

2043
02:02:18,020 --> 02:02:18,890
And then

2044
02:02:20,450 --> 02:02:25,010
a certain percentage of people feel the
need to tell a metaphysical story about

2045
02:02:25,011 --> 02:02:26,590
the significance of those experiences.
And,

2046
02:02:26,591 --> 02:02:31,591
and religion is in the
business of enshrining specific
metaphysical stories as

2047
02:02:32,151 --> 02:02:33,960
the ultimate truth.
Um,

2048
02:02:34,160 --> 02:02:38,420
we know they can't all be true because
they're all mutually canceling. Um,

2049
02:02:39,170 --> 02:02:42,470
which is to say of Christianity's
true Islam is false and vice versa.

2050
02:02:43,040 --> 02:02:44,150
Uh,
but

2051
02:02:46,280 --> 02:02:50,960
the psychedelic experience falls into the
same, uh, under the same rubric. I mean,

2052
02:02:50,961 --> 02:02:53,960
you can have all of these experiences
and not know what they mean and be very

2053
02:02:53,961 --> 02:02:56,240
humble about what they,
you know,

2054
02:02:56,241 --> 02:03:00,980
what you don't know and still value
the experiences or you can say, oh no,

2055
02:03:00,981 --> 02:03:01,520
I,

2056
02:03:01,520 --> 02:03:06,520
I'm in contact with the pleiadians and
they live in a star system and they're

2057
02:03:07,281 --> 02:03:09,470
sending messages, blah,
blah, blah. And then you,

2058
02:03:09,590 --> 02:03:14,350
then you're just part of the cacophony
of new age, uh, claims that are,

2059
02:03:14,790 --> 02:03:19,100
that are unsubstantiated. So, uh, I didn't
know that he had claimed that, that said,

2060
02:03:19,101 --> 02:03:19,940
it's really pretty funny.

2061
02:03:19,941 --> 02:03:24,470
But one of the things that he did claim
was that he was high on mushrooms and

2062
02:03:24,471 --> 02:03:25,550
they were communicating with him,

2063
02:03:25,551 --> 02:03:28,770
telling him to create a map
of time out of the Ching.

2064
02:03:28,980 --> 02:03:31,990
And it's something the whole time wave.

2065
02:03:32,910 --> 02:03:35,150
That's another thing
that just, you know, he,

2066
02:03:36,290 --> 02:03:40,520
he played some mathematical game
with the, the end date, right? Uh,

2067
02:03:40,620 --> 02:03:45,380
the king when sequence and the itching
and uh, I don't, I don't think he did it.

2068
02:03:45,381 --> 02:03:46,490
I don't think he was alone for this.

2069
02:03:46,491 --> 02:03:51,491
I think he found some mathematically
talented or crazy grad student to help him

2070
02:03:52,431 --> 02:03:57,240
with this game. But he got
some pattern of, of um,

2071
02:03:57,450 --> 02:04:00,320
what, you know, but again, you
mean how you define novelty?

2072
02:04:00,321 --> 02:04:02,870
It's so sketchy and yeah,

2073
02:04:02,900 --> 02:04:07,850
I never wanted to go down that
particular rabbit hole with him.

2074
02:04:07,940 --> 02:04:12,350
Um, but yeah, if the world ends
in eight months or whatever it is,

2075
02:04:12,880 --> 02:04:13,713
uh,

2076
02:04:13,850 --> 02:04:18,500
as he predicted or the same dictating the
singularity happened or something huge

2077
02:04:18,610 --> 02:04:21,590
that he,
what he predicted is the,

2078
02:04:21,620 --> 02:04:26,620
the asam tonic achievement
of novelty on December 21st,

2079
02:04:27,680 --> 02:04:31,430
2012. Um, uh, whatever that means,

2080
02:04:31,460 --> 02:04:34,970
it's going to be the most novel day
and the history of the universe and,

2081
02:04:35,120 --> 02:04:38,820
and nothing, nothing be the same. Um,

2082
02:04:38,880 --> 02:04:43,880
so if December 22nd dawns and basically
what we've just had another news cycle

2083
02:04:44,340 --> 02:04:49,330
and, and it's just Fox
News versus CNN, um,

2084
02:04:49,390 --> 02:04:53,640
we'll know that that novelty
theory was, was wrong. Um,

2085
02:04:53,850 --> 02:04:57,690
and then there'll be the percentage of
devotees who just think it's kind of time

2086
02:04:57,691 --> 02:05:00,970
shifted in some, you
know, well there's a way.

2087
02:05:01,820 --> 02:05:02,200
Hello.

2088
02:05:02,200 --> 02:05:05,110
Cause he was such an entertaining
speaker and I think that was really a big

2089
02:05:05,111 --> 02:05:09,160
problem. The problem was that he was so
entertaining and engaging that, you know,

2090
02:05:09,161 --> 02:05:14,161
he sort of was a prisoner to his gift
and his gift was to tell these compelling

2091
02:05:14,531 --> 02:05:16,300
stories and if the story
wasn't so compelling,

2092
02:05:16,301 --> 02:05:20,140
well you move things around and make
it compelling. And unfortunately,

2093
02:05:20,141 --> 02:05:23,320
I really found out recently because
of people in my message board kind of

2094
02:05:23,321 --> 02:05:27,520
eliminated this to me.
He changed the end date is December 21st,

2095
02:05:27,520 --> 02:05:32,520
2012 end date that he always said was
that he magically arrived at with his

2096
02:05:32,830 --> 02:05:34,780
mathematical program,
which was to the day,

2097
02:05:34,781 --> 02:05:38,410
the same end date of the long count of
the Mayan calendar. Right. He, Brian,

2098
02:05:38,411 --> 02:05:41,980
you gotta throw that fucking stupid
clock away, man. That shit's annoying.

2099
02:05:43,660 --> 02:05:46,630
Ridiculous. Meow cock.
You're a grown man. Um,

2100
02:05:46,631 --> 02:05:51,520
but apparently it was really a November.
It wasn't, uh, his, his original,

2101
02:05:51,521 --> 02:05:53,540
his original calculations
were in November. Well,

2102
02:05:53,560 --> 02:05:56,230
and then when he found out about
the end date of the Mayan calendar,

2103
02:05:56,440 --> 02:05:59,650
then he just shifted it a month.
No, which is so convenient. Right?

2104
02:05:59,651 --> 02:06:02,830
But this is ridiculous because
he used to say to the day,

2105
02:06:02,950 --> 02:06:06,220
so he was a great speaker. It was,
I mean, really, really cool ideas.

2106
02:06:06,221 --> 02:06:09,610
A lot of fun to follow.
But when you do that much,

2107
02:06:11,180 --> 02:06:16,030
you know, reality must become
like a slippery fish in
your hand, you know, really,

2108
02:06:16,240 --> 02:06:19,000
really difficult to
constantly have control of.

2109
02:06:19,090 --> 02:06:20,140
Yeah. Yeah. No,

2110
02:06:20,520 --> 02:06:25,520
that is a bit of a liability when you
say it so well you can get carried away

2111
02:06:26,981 --> 02:06:31,530
with just the, the, the experience
of, of saying it that well and to,

2112
02:06:31,531 --> 02:06:35,310
and to some degree is true with
writing. I mean, you can have,

2113
02:06:36,160 --> 02:06:40,870
I think Freud's influence
is how is outside influence.

2114
02:06:40,900 --> 02:06:43,290
It's outsize influence, which is, um,

2115
02:06:44,530 --> 02:06:48,430
kind of inexplicably given how
crazy some of his ideas were, um,

2116
02:06:49,180 --> 02:06:53,020
is born of just the quality
of his writing. And he was,

2117
02:06:53,050 --> 02:06:57,670
Freud was a great writer
and, and uh, it's just,

2118
02:06:57,671 --> 02:07:01,780
um, I mean the whole mythology he
created for what's going on in our head.

2119
02:07:01,810 --> 02:07:05,110
Fascinating. Fascinating. But it, so it's
like a, you know, it's so much of it is,

2120
02:07:05,111 --> 02:07:07,750
is cocaine base should
have been obviously bogus,

2121
02:07:07,751 --> 02:07:10,330
but he was a damn good writer.

2122
02:07:10,450 --> 02:07:14,440
Yeah. Well to this day, people, you
know, talk about 40 and slips, you know,

2123
02:07:14,441 --> 02:07:17,200
that there's somehow knows deck
going on in the back of your mind.

2124
02:07:18,030 --> 02:07:20,520
Well, it's not, the thing is,
I mean mother and there are,

2125
02:07:21,030 --> 02:07:24,390
there's a lot of unconscious
processing going on. And I mean,

2126
02:07:24,391 --> 02:07:28,660
this is actually the subject of my
current book, very short book on free.

2127
02:07:28,661 --> 02:07:32,640
Freewill is, speaks to
that. That it's just

2128
02:07:34,650 --> 02:07:37,360
the sense that we have
of being the kind of,

2129
02:07:37,460 --> 02:07:41,710
the conscious authors of our thoughts
and actions we know is false. Now.

2130
02:07:41,711 --> 02:07:46,270
It's not false in the Freudian sense that
we've got the ID and the superego and

2131
02:07:46,271 --> 02:07:49,090
the, and the ego, uh, uh, at war.

2132
02:07:49,091 --> 02:07:53,380
And it's all being driven from behind
by a kind of intelligence that's

2133
02:07:53,381 --> 02:07:58,050
consciously editing, uh, what we can
consciously know. But there's just that,

2134
02:07:58,060 --> 02:08:03,060
there's most of our PR what of what's
going on in the brain is unconscious and

2135
02:08:03,670 --> 02:08:05,960
most of it's not even
potentially conscious. And,

2136
02:08:06,070 --> 02:08:11,070
and that actually explains a lot of the
change you get with psychedelics because

2137
02:08:12,220 --> 02:08:16,000
what you change the biochemistry enough.

2138
02:08:17,160 --> 02:08:17,620
Okay

2139
02:08:17,620 --> 02:08:18,391
you,
you are,

2140
02:08:18,391 --> 02:08:21,060
you're playing with the margin of
what's conscious and what's potentially

2141
02:08:21,061 --> 02:08:21,470
conscious.

2142
02:08:21,470 --> 02:08:24,750
And we are potentially conscious of
a lot of things we don't tend to be

2143
02:08:24,751 --> 02:08:28,860
conscious of and that it
completely transforms our, our,

2144
02:08:29,160 --> 02:08:30,090
our experience.

2145
02:08:30,360 --> 02:08:33,600
But there's a lot that we're not just
potentially conscious of that the brain is

2146
02:08:33,601 --> 02:08:36,060
doing.
And it is,

2147
02:08:36,180 --> 02:08:40,710
it is everything we are conscious of
is dependent upon all of that work.

2148
02:08:40,711 --> 02:08:41,311
So for instance,

2149
02:08:41,311 --> 02:08:45,480
the fact that you are hearing my words
as words right now because you speak

2150
02:08:45,481 --> 02:08:48,390
English and I'm speaking in
English and you're parsing the,

2151
02:08:48,391 --> 02:08:50,310
so I'm making sounds and you're just,

2152
02:08:50,311 --> 02:08:53,700
you're not making any special effort to
hear words. You're just hearing words.

2153
02:08:53,701 --> 02:08:56,610
In fact, you couldn't not hear
word if you tried and it just,

2154
02:08:57,030 --> 02:08:58,710
the words are coming and
you're understanding them.

2155
02:08:58,711 --> 02:09:02,400
And I'm going to get to the end of
this sentence sometime and we'll both

2156
02:09:02,401 --> 02:09:06,780
recognize that it was more or less
grammatically correct. All of that.

2157
02:09:08,250 --> 02:09:08,690
Okay.

2158
02:09:08,690 --> 02:09:12,950
It's happening unconsciously
and you're not. And, and

2159
02:09:13,830 --> 02:09:14,500
okay,

2160
02:09:14,500 --> 02:09:19,360
you're just conscious of understanding
what I'm saying or not based on whether

2161
02:09:19,361 --> 02:09:22,960
I'm following the rules of English
grammar or not, but I'm not a,

2162
02:09:22,961 --> 02:09:26,920
I'm not aware of what's allowing me to
follow the rules. You're not aware of, of,

2163
02:09:26,921 --> 02:09:30,430
of what's allowing you
to detect my errors. Um,

2164
02:09:31,240 --> 02:09:34,750
and the truth is from a
conscious perspective,

2165
02:09:34,780 --> 02:09:37,210
I don't know how I get to
the end of the sentence.

2166
02:09:37,420 --> 02:09:38,800
And this has really like all of this,

2167
02:09:38,860 --> 02:09:43,860
this experience of talking is riding a
top of machinery that I can't inspect.

2168
02:09:44,350 --> 02:09:49,090
And when it fails, it's a, it's a
surprise and I don't know why it failed.

2169
02:09:49,720 --> 02:09:54,640
And so that's,
that's just talking about parsing speech.

2170
02:09:54,970 --> 02:09:56,140
But all of our,

2171
02:09:56,500 --> 02:10:00,090
all of our thinking and behaving
and wanting and doing all of our,

2172
02:10:00,320 --> 02:10:02,130
our inner life is made

2173
02:10:02,180 --> 02:10:05,000
of, of, of

2174
02:10:06,080 --> 02:10:08,000
unconscious processing of that sort.

2175
02:10:08,090 --> 02:10:11,960
And so their experiments where
you can show that people,

2176
02:10:13,040 --> 02:10:16,040
people, when you think you have
consciously decided to do something,

2177
02:10:16,970 --> 02:10:21,970
your brain is actually committed to
doing it half a second or some seconds

2178
02:10:22,341 --> 02:10:25,820
before your, before you, why you still
think you're making up your mind.

2179
02:10:25,821 --> 02:10:29,960
So this really nullifies a conventional
notion of free will because you're,

2180
02:10:30,680 --> 02:10:33,020
you know, if you say, if
you give me two buttons,

2181
02:10:33,110 --> 02:10:36,830
push and I can push either one I want
and I can push them when I want and you

2182
02:10:36,831 --> 02:10:40,910
just tell me to make up my mind and I
go back and forth and back and forth and

2183
02:10:40,911 --> 02:10:45,230
say I'm going to push the left one.
Which completely free choice. I did it.

2184
02:10:45,231 --> 02:10:46,430
No one forced me to do it.

2185
02:10:47,680 --> 02:10:47,890
Okay.

2186
02:10:47,890 --> 02:10:52,890
The truth is if you were recording
from my scalp with EEG or,

2187
02:10:53,211 --> 02:10:57,100
or looking with Fmr,
I at at a brain function,

2188
02:10:58,400 --> 02:11:00,830
you could detect that

2189
02:11:01,610 --> 02:11:03,930
before I thought I was committed cause I,

2190
02:11:04,100 --> 02:11:06,920
cause in these experiments subjects
watch a clock and they, and they,

2191
02:11:06,921 --> 02:11:10,720
and so I'm like watching the hands of a
clock or watching random numbers appear

2192
02:11:10,760 --> 02:11:13,470
on a screen.
And I looked and I,

2193
02:11:13,670 --> 02:11:17,660
my only goal is to just look at when
I've decided when I'm committed, I go,

2194
02:11:17,720 --> 02:11:21,860
I go back and forth between
left and right, left and
right, and then I say, okay,

2195
02:11:21,861 --> 02:11:24,230
that's the hand to the six.
I'm going to go left.

2196
02:11:25,490 --> 02:11:29,150
All the experiments show
that that for some decisions,

2197
02:11:29,240 --> 02:11:34,240
several seconds before we could
tell from the brain what whether,

2198
02:11:35,301 --> 02:11:36,830
whether the subject was
going to go left or right.

2199
02:11:36,870 --> 02:11:41,870
So your subjective sense of being truly
upstream of your decision making process

2200
02:11:42,900 --> 02:11:46,290
is, is a false one. The only problem
I have with that is two fold.

2201
02:11:46,291 --> 02:11:50,220
One is that if you're going
to study something like
that and you, you, you know,

2202
02:11:50,221 --> 02:11:52,290
you, you, you make it
clear study where you're,

2203
02:11:52,291 --> 02:11:55,590
there's a red and a green and you have
to make a choice as to which one and you

2204
02:11:55,591 --> 02:12:00,000
monitor the subject's brain. Is that
real? Is that real life? I mean,

2205
02:12:00,001 --> 02:12:01,860
it's a fucking test, you know? I mean,

2206
02:12:01,861 --> 02:12:03,750
how do we know what's going
on in a real life scenario?

2207
02:12:03,751 --> 02:12:06,360
How do we know that there's not a lot of
overthinking going on? How are we now?

2208
02:12:06,361 --> 02:12:09,500
There's not a lot of shit going
on behind the scenes like in,

2209
02:12:09,501 --> 02:12:12,330
in this sort of a situation because you're
a, you're, you're setting up this test,

2210
02:12:12,800 --> 02:12:13,900
right? To can, can,

2211
02:12:13,920 --> 02:12:18,510
could psychedelics change free will if
a psychedelic experience changes your

2212
02:12:18,511 --> 02:12:22,260
whole tune? Could it, could
it literally change what,

2213
02:12:22,470 --> 02:12:25,740
what decisions you would
automatically make? I mean,

2214
02:12:25,741 --> 02:12:29,580
if there is no freewill of freewill is
just your mind for whatever reason goes

2215
02:12:29,581 --> 02:12:33,960
left or right based on morals or ethics
or what feels right or what feels wrong

2216
02:12:34,140 --> 02:12:38,490
in that sense, wouldn't psychedelics
be able to change free will? Well,

2217
02:12:38,491 --> 02:12:42,640
I think freewill is, is a
truly incoherent, crazy words.

2218
02:12:42,680 --> 02:12:44,400
It just doesn't make a placeholder.

2219
02:12:44,550 --> 02:12:46,570
We have,
we have causality and,

2220
02:12:46,571 --> 02:12:50,520
and no one has ever described a way in
which mental or physical events can arise

2221
02:12:51,030 --> 02:12:56,030
that make sense of this idea of freewill
or of being the true locus of the

2222
02:12:56,401 --> 02:12:58,800
causes of your thoughts and
actions. And, and this is,

2223
02:12:59,220 --> 02:13:00,780
most people think that we have this,

2224
02:13:02,210 --> 02:13:03,043
the,

2225
02:13:03,320 --> 02:13:06,230
it's a mystery here that we have this
subjective experience of freewill,

2226
02:13:06,800 --> 02:13:10,550
but we can't map it on to a notion
of physical cause and effect.

2227
02:13:11,270 --> 02:13:12,980
But I think if you've looked closely,

2228
02:13:12,981 --> 02:13:15,500
you realize you don't even have this
objective experience of free will.

2229
02:13:15,520 --> 02:13:19,690
So if I ask you, you
know, think of a, a, a,

2230
02:13:19,750 --> 02:13:23,930
an MMA fighter. Okay. Okay.
So did you get one? Yes. Okay.

2231
02:13:23,931 --> 02:13:25,820
Who'd you think of [inaudible]
Saint Pierre. Okay.

2232
02:13:26,150 --> 02:13:31,010
So now why didn't you think
of Matt Hughes? Uh, okay. Now,

2233
02:13:31,060 --> 02:13:33,720
until now, whatever story you're gonna
tell him about his menial, right?

2234
02:13:33,910 --> 02:13:38,910
So the truth is you're not in a position
to know why you thought of George St

2235
02:13:39,390 --> 02:13:42,450
Pierre. Right? And so, so, okay,

2236
02:13:42,590 --> 02:13:45,330
there are all these MMA
fighters whose names you know,

2237
02:13:45,570 --> 02:13:48,750
and you know them as well as, you
know, George Saint Pierre, his name,

2238
02:13:48,960 --> 02:13:50,940
you could have thought of Overeem or,

2239
02:13:50,941 --> 02:13:52,880
I mean there's a hundred you
could have thought of, right?

2240
02:13:55,670 --> 02:13:56,000
Yeah.

2241
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:56,290
You,

2242
02:13:56,290 --> 02:13:59,860
let's say you thought of a few and then
you settled on one to tell it for the

2243
02:13:59,861 --> 02:14:02,850
purposes of telling me what you thought
of since he got Hughes and you got over

2244
02:14:02,851 --> 02:14:05,260
him, you guys Saint Pierre and then
I said, well who was it? And you say,

2245
02:14:05,261 --> 02:14:06,610
well Saint Pierre,
right?

2246
02:14:07,090 --> 02:14:12,090
You can't explain why you fixated on
him as opposed to Hughes or whoever the

2247
02:14:12,581 --> 02:14:13,900
other candidates were in your mind.

2248
02:14:14,200 --> 02:14:19,200
All of that's being driven from behind
unconsciously and there's no way to ever,

2249
02:14:20,500 --> 02:14:24,720
even if it wasn't even if there was
no time lag, even if we knew that the,

2250
02:14:24,740 --> 02:14:29,500
the neurophysiology and the, and the
conscious thought were truly simultaneous.

2251
02:14:29,501 --> 02:14:33,240
So there was no part of your brain that
was going George Saint Pierre before you

2252
02:14:33,241 --> 02:14:38,170
are aware of it, right? It's still a
mystery as to why it is what it is.

2253
02:14:38,350 --> 02:14:39,400
Right?
But that's sort of a,

2254
02:14:39,401 --> 02:14:43,060
an answer to a question
with no consequence when
it comes to something with

2255
02:14:43,061 --> 02:14:46,480
consequences and their freewill. Then
when someone contemplates the, you know,

2256
02:14:46,481 --> 02:14:48,940
the results of their actions.
And I mean is,

2257
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:51,670
isn't that what we really truly
consider to be free wills?

2258
02:14:51,671 --> 02:14:54,730
You look at something and you so should
have hit this old lady with my car. No,

2259
02:14:54,731 --> 02:14:58,690
I should not because I have free will.
I mean, even if there was, you know,

2260
02:14:58,720 --> 02:15:02,680
some sort of a decision that had, you
know, green lit in your brain, you know,

2261
02:15:02,681 --> 02:15:05,290
seconds earlier than that, no, we're
not going to run over this old lady.

2262
02:15:06,190 --> 02:15:11,050
Sort of that's freewill,
right? I mean, what, what leads
someone to murder someone?

2263
02:15:11,080 --> 02:15:14,110
Is every murderer innocent
because they don't have freewill?

2264
02:15:14,140 --> 02:15:18,100
Are they a accumulation of their past
histories and our emotional responses to

2265
02:15:18,250 --> 02:15:22,030
various stimuli, good or bad
in their environment that's
led them down this road.

2266
02:15:22,031 --> 02:15:24,940
And here they are in this moment in time
and this physical altercation and they

2267
02:15:24,941 --> 02:15:29,800
murder somebody. Do they not have free
will? Right. Yeah. So all good concerns.

2268
02:15:29,820 --> 02:15:30,653
Um,

2269
02:15:31,420 --> 02:15:31,890
okay.

2270
02:15:31,890 --> 02:15:32,641
Clearly there's a,

2271
02:15:32,641 --> 02:15:35,720
there's a difference between
voluntary and involuntary action and,

2272
02:15:35,750 --> 02:15:39,000
and so we can talk about that difference
without ever invoking freewill.

2273
02:15:39,001 --> 02:15:39,380
So they're,

2274
02:15:39,380 --> 02:15:43,300
they're the things I choose to do and
I'm reaching for the water because I want

2275
02:15:43,301 --> 02:15:48,210
to pick it up. And that's different from
me accidentally knocking it over or,

2276
02:15:48,211 --> 02:15:50,940
or so, so, and, and
those differences matter.

2277
02:15:50,941 --> 02:15:55,170
So if you intentionally shot me,
that's one thing.

2278
02:15:55,171 --> 02:15:58,830
You're a murder and attempted
murder. Um, if your,

2279
02:15:58,831 --> 02:16:01,500
if you accidentally shot maybe
cause you were cleaning your gun,

2280
02:16:01,740 --> 02:16:03,470
there was no intent and that says a lot.

2281
02:16:03,900 --> 02:16:05,610
You're a very different
person in the world.

2282
02:16:05,611 --> 02:16:08,700
You're not the person who
intentionally shot me. Um,

2283
02:16:09,240 --> 02:16:12,290
so we don't have to worry about
you in the same way. Um, so for,

2284
02:16:12,450 --> 02:16:16,620
for the purposes of our legal system,
the difference between intent and, and,

2285
02:16:16,621 --> 02:16:18,420
and lack of intent is huge.

2286
02:16:18,720 --> 02:16:23,160
But it's huge because it says a lot
about what someone's likely to do in the

2287
02:16:23,161 --> 02:16:23,994
future.

2288
02:16:24,770 --> 02:16:25,090
Yeah.

2289
02:16:25,090 --> 02:16:27,370
That the payoff is that,

2290
02:16:28,310 --> 02:16:29,020
yeah,

2291
02:16:29,020 --> 02:16:30,040
there are

2292
02:16:30,430 --> 02:16:32,050
one,
I think understanding that,

2293
02:16:32,051 --> 02:16:36,880
that the incoherence of freewill
does subtly change your,

2294
02:16:37,600 --> 02:16:42,010
your morality and would
change our legal system in,

2295
02:16:42,011 --> 02:16:46,440
in small but crucial ways because
okay.

2296
02:16:46,570 --> 02:16:49,540
Changes your morality because
you have to acknowledge that

2297
02:16:52,190 --> 02:16:55,520
there's a huge role.
For luck in this world that,

2298
02:16:55,550 --> 02:16:58,400
that that is morally relevant that
we don't acknowledge. So, I mean,

2299
02:16:58,401 --> 02:17:02,570
you are not responsible for the
fact that you have your genes,

2300
02:17:02,840 --> 02:17:06,830
that you were born to this, this society
that you've had your life experience,

2301
02:17:06,831 --> 02:17:08,660
that you're brave. You,
you didn't make your brain,

2302
02:17:08,661 --> 02:17:12,030
your brain isn't exactly the
state it's in based on Noah. You,

2303
02:17:12,040 --> 02:17:16,160
it's not an accomplishment of
yours. Right. You and Andy,

2304
02:17:17,940 --> 02:17:20,730
you can't take credit for the
fact that you're not a psychopath.

2305
02:17:20,760 --> 02:17:24,450
You are lucky that you're not a
psychopath. On some basic level,

2306
02:17:24,451 --> 02:17:27,600
you would be unlucky to have the genes
and the life experience that would make

2307
02:17:27,601 --> 02:17:31,430
you want to get up tomorrow morning and
kill kids. Do you think that cycle, that,

2308
02:17:31,460 --> 02:17:34,030
that sort of a pathology
is inherently genetic,

2309
02:17:34,140 --> 02:17:36,680
do you think that know better mental,
whether it's combination.

2310
02:17:36,720 --> 02:17:38,760
So it's a combination. It's,
it's significantly genetic,

2311
02:17:38,761 --> 02:17:41,760
but so was a combination of environment,
but you didn't pick your environment.

2312
02:17:41,780 --> 02:17:42,210
Right?
Right.

2313
02:17:42,210 --> 02:17:44,910
But it's not something that someone
can avoid based on a bunch of different

2314
02:17:44,930 --> 02:17:47,070
circumstances. Yeah. So,

2315
02:17:47,610 --> 02:17:52,170
so I'm not negating the role of human
effort and human intention and we can

2316
02:17:52,171 --> 02:17:56,100
change ourselves. We can, we can get in
shape, we can learn new skills, we can,

2317
02:17:56,190 --> 02:17:57,360
we can improve relationships.

2318
02:17:57,530 --> 02:18:01,980
This is everything about what people
want to want to do with their lives,

2319
02:18:02,460 --> 02:18:04,350
um,
can be conserved.

2320
02:18:04,830 --> 02:18:09,550
But the truth is some people are
much luckier than others. I mean,

2321
02:18:09,551 --> 02:18:11,020
it's like, and, and, but,

2322
02:18:11,070 --> 02:18:13,860
and no one can take credit for
the fact that they're intelligent,

2323
02:18:13,861 --> 02:18:16,320
that they're good looking that there,
I mean, it's, it's like, so say this,

2324
02:18:16,321 --> 02:18:19,560
but what about the
secret, correct? Yes. Yes.

2325
02:18:19,660 --> 02:18:23,900
That talk about the dangerous nonsense.
Did that drive you crazy when that was,

2326
02:18:24,330 --> 02:18:28,750
you know, was, was all coming
out that was a oh yeah, it was,

2327
02:18:29,230 --> 02:18:32,630
that was the most irresponsible thing
in the world from Oprah's Oprah, Oprah,

2328
02:18:32,690 --> 02:18:35,310
Oprah is boosting of
that book. Was, was, uh,

2329
02:18:35,850 --> 02:18:39,130
journalistically irresponsible in
the way that, that, that few things,

2330
02:18:39,140 --> 02:18:41,040
it's amazing watching
people run with it though.

2331
02:18:41,041 --> 02:18:43,710
People that were convinced that all of
a sudden they were going to create their

2332
02:18:43,711 --> 02:18:46,440
life with their imagination.
Right. But sort of,

2333
02:18:46,740 --> 02:18:51,540
there is some sort of an impact that
your thoughts in mind have on the real

2334
02:18:51,541 --> 02:18:55,730
world. Oh No. It's positive
energy. Psychic energy.

2335
02:18:55,750 --> 02:18:56,930
There's something there.
Yeah.

2336
02:18:56,940 --> 02:18:59,970
If you're a nice person and you're
thinking nice thoughts about people,

2337
02:19:00,540 --> 02:19:02,760
they're going to notice that.
And like you, and that's,

2338
02:19:02,840 --> 02:19:05,910
that becomes a self fulfilling
loop. I mean, you were like, if you,

2339
02:19:05,911 --> 02:19:09,660
if you are an angry person who's always
noticing what's wrong with the people

2340
02:19:09,661 --> 02:19:13,780
around you, that that's, that's very
hard to keep to yourself. Right?

2341
02:19:13,830 --> 02:19:16,680
And people began to treat you a
certain way and it becomes self.

2342
02:19:16,830 --> 02:19:21,360
So you think it's an entirely
social pointers of a thought?

2343
02:19:21,690 --> 02:19:24,540
Well, I, there is not,

2344
02:19:24,930 --> 02:19:29,420
I wouldn't attribute any
spooky level to it. It's all,

2345
02:19:29,421 --> 02:19:31,990
it's all understandable. Um, you've,

2346
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:36,560
you ever seen like mass prayers where they
work on a certain, you know, thing and,

2347
02:19:36,600 --> 02:19:41,450
uh, you know, everybody together try
to pull up their energy that, well,

2348
02:19:41,470 --> 02:19:45,860
that's, it would be so it would
be so easy to demonstrate and,

2349
02:19:46,300 --> 02:19:48,230
and there's been so much prayer.

2350
02:19:48,930 --> 02:19:49,763
MMM.

2351
02:19:50,730 --> 02:19:54,530
That Ha. I mean, it's just, it's,
I mean, this is what the great, um,

2352
02:19:57,710 --> 02:20:01,640
the website. Why, why does God hate
amputees? I mean it's it because it's so,

2353
02:20:01,641 --> 02:20:05,720
so you have all these people who
believe they've been healed through

2354
02:20:05,890 --> 02:20:10,490
intercessory prayer of their cancer and
all these other diseases that are self

2355
02:20:10,491 --> 02:20:12,710
limiting.
You'd never hear somebody up here.

2356
02:20:12,740 --> 02:20:16,640
If somebody who's prayed to grow back
and arm and said, look, you know,

2357
02:20:16,970 --> 02:20:19,520
here's a picture of me without an arm.
And now they're both back on the,

2358
02:20:19,521 --> 02:20:23,360
on like the human salamander.
You, if prayer worked,

2359
02:20:24,020 --> 02:20:27,140
you'd be able to pray for
lost arms that you say that.

2360
02:20:27,141 --> 02:20:29,820
But what a prayer only works
a really tiny bit and you go,

2361
02:20:29,821 --> 02:20:33,460
you have a lot of people involved.
There's boosts your immune system. No,

2362
02:20:33,580 --> 02:20:36,320
I mean it's just not, it's not
perfect. It's not magic. Is there,

2363
02:20:36,321 --> 02:20:40,850
is there power in thought, but
it is billed as magic. Yes,

2364
02:20:40,880 --> 02:20:44,750
it is billed as magic, but every once,
okay, God, if we're talking about God,

2365
02:20:44,751 --> 02:20:47,570
I'm talking about groups of people
praying for things I'm talking about using

2366
02:20:47,571 --> 02:20:48,530
their energy of their thoughts.

2367
02:20:48,530 --> 02:20:51,560
I'm not really talking about invoking
a higher power, I'm just stopping up.

2368
02:20:51,570 --> 02:20:56,300
But no, but they think they are. Maybe
it was just making it a with art bell,

2369
02:20:56,390 --> 02:20:59,000
you remember that child? Our
Bell? Yeah. Coast to coast.

2370
02:20:59,001 --> 02:21:01,490
Werewolves at three o'clock in the
morning when you're driving on am radio.

2371
02:21:02,360 --> 02:21:05,240
I believe he did some sort
of a chest where he tried to,

2372
02:21:05,420 --> 02:21:08,570
they tried to influence something,
whether it's weather or something with,

2373
02:21:08,610 --> 02:21:13,370
you know, a gigantic MindMeld off. But
it wasn't, it wasn't a religious thing.

2374
02:21:13,580 --> 02:21:17,270
I think the idea was it can you get
a bunch of people to concentrate on

2375
02:21:17,271 --> 02:21:22,271
something and do we have like the most
minute ability to influence things and

2376
02:21:23,391 --> 02:21:25,220
together we could do something measurable.

2377
02:21:25,221 --> 02:21:26,750
But I dunno if anybody ever do anything.

2378
02:21:27,530 --> 02:21:31,820
A lot of people who have done research
of that kind and what they claim is just

2379
02:21:31,821 --> 02:21:34,610
that these,
these micro departures,

2380
02:21:34,970 --> 02:21:39,200
these micro effects that when
you aggregate them over many,

2381
02:21:39,201 --> 02:21:44,201
many trials represent huge statistical
departures from chance and met.

2382
02:21:45,260 --> 02:21:49,220
Most people in the skeptic community
find that completely unpersuasive because

2383
02:21:49,221 --> 02:21:53,360
you looked into it at all
like random number generator.
And I've just, I haven't,

2384
02:21:53,480 --> 02:21:57,530
apart from just reading a couple of
books like Dean Raven's book on the

2385
02:21:57,531 --> 02:22:01,370
conscious universe, um,
it's what you come down to.

2386
02:22:01,371 --> 02:22:06,371
There are just Meta analyses of
someone's statistics and the,

2387
02:22:07,520 --> 02:22:10,460
the concern on the part of
skeptics that, you know, there,

2388
02:22:10,500 --> 02:22:13,730
there are frauds involved or there's just
a file drawer effect where people are

2389
02:22:13,731 --> 02:22:18,580
not reporting their failures and
they are reporting the, the, the, um,

2390
02:22:19,850 --> 02:22:24,680
the positive results. And so,
um, there's just what you want,

2391
02:22:24,681 --> 02:22:28,320
what you should be able to find
is if these are, if these are,

2392
02:22:28,350 --> 02:22:32,840
if these are real abilities that that
really matter in terms of, you know,

2393
02:22:33,120 --> 02:22:34,380
tangible results tend to,

2394
02:22:34,381 --> 02:22:39,381
you should find someone who can come
into the lab and demonstrate telepathy or

2395
02:22:40,050 --> 02:22:42,390
clairvoyance or whatever the thing
is you're interested in. And so,

2396
02:22:42,391 --> 02:22:43,980
so that it's really,

2397
02:22:44,790 --> 02:22:48,580
it should survive the presence
of a skeptic like James Randy,

2398
02:22:48,600 --> 02:22:53,430
who's a professional magician who knows
how to fake these mentalist games. Um,

2399
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:57,390
you should be able to test it in.
So I actually have short,

2400
02:22:57,420 --> 02:23:00,570
I spoke to Rupert Sheldrake about this
one's cause you do, you know, sure.

2401
02:23:01,360 --> 02:23:02,193
Residence.

2402
02:23:02,650 --> 02:23:07,650
I said he's a big advocate of the
scientific testing of these phenomenon,

2403
02:23:11,100 --> 02:23:15,830
but he's very, um, he's a
believer. He's a, he's a,

2404
02:23:15,831 --> 02:23:18,450
he's a, he's a real
believer and you know, he's,

2405
02:23:18,451 --> 02:23:21,520
he's published essays or,

2406
02:23:21,780 --> 02:23:24,800
or articles on,
you know,

2407
02:23:24,870 --> 02:23:27,420
pets that know when their
owners are going to come home.

2408
02:23:27,421 --> 02:23:30,930
And so he's got the camera on the dog and
the owners headed home and he's got it

2409
02:23:30,931 --> 02:23:34,920
them times sinkton showing the effect
of the dog getting up at the right time.

2410
02:23:35,640 --> 02:23:40,640
And he's very into the idea
of democratizing science
where you can get thousands

2411
02:23:41,131 --> 02:23:43,890
of people doing these tests on
their own and, and, and, and,

2412
02:23:43,891 --> 02:23:45,690
and showing some effect.
Uh,

2413
02:23:45,870 --> 02:23:50,870
but what he hasn't wanted to do is
just actually submit to James Randy's

2414
02:23:51,091 --> 02:23:55,580
challenge of showing up and doing
an experiment that will survive the,

2415
02:23:56,110 --> 02:23:59,130
the,
the scrutiny of professional magicians.

2416
02:23:59,670 --> 02:24:03,270
And I'll just allow this
thing to be, and, and I,

2417
02:24:04,320 --> 02:24:05,160
it's just,
you know,

2418
02:24:05,190 --> 02:24:10,190
people find James Randy's
skepticism so unpleasant that they,

2419
02:24:11,221 --> 02:24:14,970
that they think that that would
nullify the experiment or somehow,

2420
02:24:14,971 --> 02:24:16,620
or they're not going to submit
to it. But I mean, James,

2421
02:24:16,621 --> 02:24:21,060
Randy has put up $1 million to anyone
who can show some positive result.

2422
02:24:21,540 --> 02:24:25,710
Um, now I no doubt he's not the easiest
guy to deal with. If you actually,

2423
02:24:25,711 --> 02:24:27,040
you know, if you are a, a,

2424
02:24:27,210 --> 02:24:30,690
a committed to the reality of psychic
phenomenon and you have to go in and meet

2425
02:24:30,691 --> 02:24:34,080
with James, Randy and, and
design an experiment, um,

2426
02:24:34,260 --> 02:24:36,150
I'm sure he's gonna he's,
uh,

2427
02:24:36,870 --> 02:24:39,360
he's going to make you jump through hoops
that you feel like you don't have to

2428
02:24:39,361 --> 02:24:41,990
jump jump through. But yeah, it would,

2429
02:24:42,050 --> 02:24:44,790
it would be trivially easy
to design a valid experiment.

2430
02:24:45,150 --> 02:24:49,050
They could demonstrate these, these
effects. And so I'm open minded that,

2431
02:24:49,200 --> 02:24:52,940
that this stuff is
possible, but it's, it's,

2432
02:24:53,020 --> 02:24:56,360
it's fishy that he hasn't,

2433
02:24:56,380 --> 02:24:59,370
it just had taken the people
should just come forward and, and,

2434
02:24:59,430 --> 02:25:04,020
and demonstrate the effect. Well, what is
rel Rupert's claims? I mean, is it, is it,

2435
02:25:04,280 --> 02:25:09,180
you know, that every single time Rupert
Rupert's claim was that, that, um,

2436
02:25:10,260 --> 02:25:14,850
he doesn't think science should be decided
by contest. Essentially. It's like,

2437
02:25:14,851 --> 02:25:17,070
it's, it's not, that's not how you
do science. You don't do science.

2438
02:25:17,071 --> 02:25:19,620
To answer $1 million challenge
put up by a magician.

2439
02:25:20,100 --> 02:25:22,890
And that's a okay.
I,

2440
02:25:23,280 --> 02:25:26,170
the kind of the his aesthetic objection.

2441
02:25:26,171 --> 02:25:30,760
Or is interpersonal objection to working
with, with a cranky person like Randy,

2442
02:25:31,210 --> 02:25:35,800
but I'm cranky, not in the, in the flaky
sense, but cranky just in the, you know,

2443
02:25:35,801 --> 02:25:39,220
he's a, he's a confrontation.
Yeah. He's confrontational. Um,

2444
02:25:40,270 --> 02:25:45,270
but given how the whole field of
Paris psychology and you know,

2445
02:25:46,120 --> 02:25:51,120
cy studies is treated like intellectual
pornography given how discredited it is

2446
02:25:51,311 --> 02:25:54,190
in the, in the view of,
of mainstream science.

2447
02:25:54,970 --> 02:25:58,720
If there's an effect there and you've
got a protocol that has demonstrated it,

2448
02:25:59,020 --> 02:26:00,580
just come forward and do it.

2449
02:26:01,120 --> 02:26:04,690
Do it in every context where you
can shine light on it and, and,

2450
02:26:04,950 --> 02:26:09,940
and just prove it. Um, and Sheldrick
has never done this, not well,

2451
02:26:09,941 --> 02:26:12,850
not to anyone's
satisfaction that, that, um,

2452
02:26:14,740 --> 02:26:17,330
that, that can move the conversation
forward. And he says he, you know,

2453
02:26:17,540 --> 02:26:19,090
there's many people who
say they've done it,

2454
02:26:19,480 --> 02:26:20,890
but when you actually look at what they,

2455
02:26:22,120 --> 02:26:27,070
what hasn't happened is you haven't,
you haven't discovered people with,

2456
02:26:27,100 --> 02:26:30,860
with where there's a really strong effect
where you get one person who's like,

2457
02:26:30,970 --> 02:26:35,770
you know, the tiger woods of,
of mind rating, where you were,

2458
02:26:36,280 --> 02:26:39,460
where they can actually show
a departure from, from chance.

2459
02:26:39,460 --> 02:26:42,940
That is huge in, uh, in their own trial.

2460
02:26:42,941 --> 02:26:47,941
What you get is if you get 6,000 people
staring at a random number generator

2461
02:26:48,280 --> 02:26:52,330
trying to make it depart to the high
side as opposed to the low side,

2462
02:26:52,960 --> 02:26:56,890
you get people saying that
there was this tiny effect.

2463
02:26:56,891 --> 02:26:58,810
So it should have been 50,
50.

2464
02:26:59,170 --> 02:27:02,530
It was actually 51% over all those trials.

2465
02:27:02,890 --> 02:27:06,220
And that when you do the stats on it is a,
you know,

2466
02:27:06,221 --> 02:27:09,490
you would expect a one in
10 billion due to chance.

2467
02:27:10,450 --> 02:27:11,830
That's just,
um,

2468
02:27:12,970 --> 02:27:17,230
that's subject to many kind of
experimenter, uh, problems that, that,

2469
02:27:17,260 --> 02:27:21,370
that people are right to worry about,
which is one you didn't, I mean,

2470
02:27:21,371 --> 02:27:24,800
people have been caught not reporting
their failed experiments. I mean there's,

2471
02:27:24,801 --> 02:27:29,740
so there's a kind of a true believer
syndrome that happens even in certain

2472
02:27:29,741 --> 02:27:30,521
things. I mean there's, there's a,

2473
02:27:30,521 --> 02:27:33,160
there's a phenomenon of
scientific fraud across science,

2474
02:27:33,161 --> 02:27:37,630
which is a problem we guard against.
But, um, it's also been true of,

2475
02:27:37,780 --> 02:27:40,000
of pair of psychology as well.

2476
02:27:40,300 --> 02:27:45,300
Do you think it's possible that people
have these certain senses that have not

2477
02:27:45,701 --> 02:27:49,600
evolved yet? And that that's why
like sometimes you know, you know,

2478
02:27:49,601 --> 02:27:52,120
someone's going to call you and you pick
up the phone and it's them. You know,

2479
02:27:52,121 --> 02:27:57,121
there's weird non duplicate
a bowl that's on a word.

2480
02:27:58,290 --> 02:28:01,690
There's weird experiences that you can't
duplicate. You know, there's, there's,

2481
02:28:01,720 --> 02:28:06,610
there's random weird things that can't
be controlled, but sometimes the,

2482
02:28:06,611 --> 02:28:11,490
the right frequency kicks in and you
catch a radio station from San Diego when

2483
02:28:11,500 --> 02:28:13,240
you're in San Francisco and
it doesn't make any sense.

2484
02:28:13,241 --> 02:28:17,290
And it only lasts for a little while. Is
it, is it possible? Do you believe? Like,

2485
02:28:17,291 --> 02:28:20,290
have you ever had personal
experiences where you know,

2486
02:28:20,291 --> 02:28:22,190
you knew someone was staring
at you and you looked

2487
02:28:22,190 --> 02:28:25,660
and they were, you knew the phone
was gonna ring and a dead. Oh yeah.

2488
02:28:27,080 --> 02:28:29,900
It's all bullshit. Well,
no, it's not bullshit, but

2489
02:28:32,240 --> 02:28:34,040
a huge component.

2490
02:28:34,130 --> 02:28:38,930
And perhaps the component that explains
all of those experiences is what's

2491
02:28:38,931 --> 02:28:40,590
called sampling bias.
Where are you?

2492
02:28:40,730 --> 02:28:43,490
You notice all the hits and you
don't notice that the non hits,

2493
02:28:43,491 --> 02:28:47,480
you don't notice all the time you pick
up the phone and you had no idea who was

2494
02:28:47,481 --> 02:28:49,830
calling you, which is most
of the time. Right. Um,

2495
02:28:50,300 --> 02:28:54,300
and this was before caller id.
Obviously caller ID has, has, has,

2496
02:28:54,620 --> 02:28:58,930
has ruled out the psychic phenomenon.
Um,

2497
02:28:59,030 --> 02:29:03,020
but so we're not, we're just,
we know, we don't keep track.

2498
02:29:03,160 --> 02:29:07,580
We w one w w the hits are salient to
us and the, and the failures aren't,

2499
02:29:07,581 --> 02:29:09,950
and so,
and religious people do this all the time.

2500
02:29:09,951 --> 02:29:12,530
God always gets credit for
the good things he does,

2501
02:29:13,070 --> 02:29:17,150
but he doesn't get scored for all the,
the disaster as he fails to prevent. So,

2502
02:29:17,151 --> 02:29:17,730
you know,

2503
02:29:17,730 --> 02:29:22,260
a bus crashes and everyone's dead except
one little girl and it's a miracle.

2504
02:29:22,310 --> 02:29:24,890
It's God's miracle that,
you know, she walked away.

2505
02:29:24,920 --> 02:29:28,310
But what about all the dead people?
So of course, um, and so the,

2506
02:29:28,311 --> 02:29:32,770
the non hits always out weigh the hits
and if you actually do, so the, and the,

2507
02:29:32,870 --> 02:29:37,640
the classic demonstration of this, which
is still shocking to people is, is the,

2508
02:29:37,641 --> 02:29:40,190
um, it's called the, the,

2509
02:29:40,191 --> 02:29:42,710
the hot hand fallacy and basketball,

2510
02:29:42,740 --> 02:29:46,760
the idea that people get on a shooting
streak, you know, Michael Jordan,

2511
02:29:46,761 --> 02:29:51,380
he would shoot two outside jumpers and
when, when he goes up for his third,

2512
02:29:52,370 --> 02:29:57,050
there's this sense both in him and in
the audience that he's actually more

2513
02:29:57,051 --> 02:29:59,270
likely to make that third shot.

2514
02:29:59,600 --> 02:30:04,040
Having made those pro prior to
because he's, he's just on a roll.

2515
02:30:04,160 --> 02:30:09,160
So that whole feeling of being on a role
in basketball has been studied because,

2516
02:30:09,930 --> 02:30:13,400
uh, what's amazing about professional
sports like basketball is,

2517
02:30:13,430 --> 02:30:17,570
is these statistics are like every
single game that has ever been played.

2518
02:30:18,020 --> 02:30:21,560
It's completely broken down. And that we
know what we know every shot and every,

2519
02:30:21,590 --> 02:30:25,760
every, you know, uh, a basket
and every rebound. And so,

2520
02:30:26,330 --> 02:30:29,360
so statisticians could
just sit down and analyze,

2521
02:30:29,390 --> 02:30:31,010
is there such a thing as the hot hand?

2522
02:30:31,011 --> 02:30:35,270
Is it actually true that if a guy
has made three jumpers in a row,

2523
02:30:35,570 --> 02:30:39,830
he's more likely to make the fourth
or as the fourth truly independent of

2524
02:30:39,831 --> 02:30:42,080
everything that's gone before.
And they just,

2525
02:30:42,110 --> 02:30:47,110
they found that despite the personal
experience of being on a roll and despite

2526
02:30:47,571 --> 02:30:50,240
the fact that we feel like we've
all seen someone on a role,

2527
02:30:51,290 --> 02:30:55,040
there's really no such thing as
being on a role in basketball. Now,

2528
02:30:55,041 --> 02:30:58,130
there may be other sports where
it's different, but there's so much,

2529
02:30:58,190 --> 02:31:02,360
there's so much chaos and
so much uncertainty in once
that ball leaves your hand,

2530
02:31:03,110 --> 02:31:04,910
uh, it's, it's, it's a,

2531
02:31:04,911 --> 02:31:09,890
it's a low percentage enough phenomenon
that it is actually insensitive to

2532
02:31:10,460 --> 02:31:12,890
statistical analysis. No,
it's, it's insensitive,

2533
02:31:12,920 --> 02:31:16,610
insensitive to the fact that you feel
great and everything's going well for you

2534
02:31:16,611 --> 02:31:20,070
and you just sank two baskets
and you go up to sink a third.

2535
02:31:20,310 --> 02:31:24,560
That third is you're no more likely
to sink that third. Then you were a,

2536
02:31:24,580 --> 02:31:28,380
if it was your first one and you're, or
you would just, or you just failed to, to,

2537
02:31:28,860 --> 02:31:31,650
to you, you just missed two and
then you go up for the third.

2538
02:31:31,651 --> 02:31:35,160
So do you completely discount the
players comfort like when they feel like

2539
02:31:35,161 --> 02:31:36,960
during the zone that doesn't exist?
I mean,

2540
02:31:36,961 --> 02:31:41,340
what is the zone state of mine
that created having an experience?

2541
02:31:41,690 --> 02:31:45,090
So what's amazing about this is this
is no one's ever more likely to make a

2542
02:31:45,091 --> 02:31:46,020
basket.
Is that what you're saying?

2543
02:31:46,120 --> 02:31:48,750
A quarter now they're confident and they
make the basket knowing that they're

2544
02:31:48,751 --> 02:31:51,370
going to make the basket.
Statistically you say that that doesn't,

2545
02:31:51,740 --> 02:31:55,230
there is no sign of a, and this, again,

2546
02:31:55,710 --> 02:32:00,180
this research is probably, it's probably
10 years old or so. So you know,

2547
02:32:00,270 --> 02:32:01,770
maybe something's happened
in the last decade,

2548
02:32:01,830 --> 02:32:05,340
buddy land just fucked up the whole
thing. Right, exactly. But my,

2549
02:32:05,390 --> 02:32:09,360
my understanding is there
is zero evidence of,

2550
02:32:09,420 --> 02:32:12,840
of what's called the hot hand in
basketball. So that it literally, it is a,

2551
02:32:12,860 --> 02:32:16,980
it is a subjective error that
everyone feels powerfully.

2552
02:32:16,981 --> 02:32:19,040
And so given that,
and it says,

2553
02:32:19,110 --> 02:32:23,130
just map that on to all of our psychic
so-called psychic experiences where you

2554
02:32:23,131 --> 02:32:28,131
feel like you knew someone was going
to call or we're just just luck it.

2555
02:32:28,830 --> 02:32:32,670
Yeah. It's just, it's just there's
gonna be some, how do you know though?

2556
02:32:32,880 --> 02:32:35,970
How do you know it's just luck?
How do you know it's not either or?

2557
02:32:35,971 --> 02:32:39,950
How do you know it's not well, cause
I'm ty was tested a brief buddy. Yeah.

2558
02:32:40,110 --> 02:32:41,400
It shouldn't be just testing it.

2559
02:32:41,401 --> 02:32:45,090
You're by caught by placing
the experiment on anything,

2560
02:32:45,120 --> 02:32:47,220
don't you automatically
alter the results of it?

2561
02:32:47,221 --> 02:32:48,720
Especially we talking about something.

2562
02:32:48,721 --> 02:32:52,530
So a theory is an idea of
a friend and then boom,

2563
02:32:52,590 --> 02:32:55,080
there's an email in your box.
You haven't talked to them in years.

2564
02:32:55,380 --> 02:32:58,270
I'm just playing devil's advocate here
because I don't believe in it. Listen,

2565
02:32:58,280 --> 02:33:01,340
I've had to, I had, I don't know that
I don't believe in either. So here's a,

2566
02:33:01,400 --> 02:33:04,430
here's a, here's one weird experience
like that that I've had, which, uh,

2567
02:33:04,650 --> 02:33:08,910
may statistically it seems a
completely beyond the pale,

2568
02:33:08,911 --> 02:33:11,190
but it's,
again,

2569
02:33:11,370 --> 02:33:15,870
there are going to be low probability
events that happen every day. And, and,

2570
02:33:15,960 --> 02:33:20,910
and so, you know, I, I know
a guy who went, for instance,
his college girlfriend,

2571
02:33:21,830 --> 02:33:22,240
uh,

2572
02:33:22,240 --> 02:33:27,090
when broke up with him and went to Europe
and he was convinced the relationship

2573
02:33:27,091 --> 02:33:31,510
wasn't over and he decided he was going
to go to Europe to find her. Right?

2574
02:33:31,540 --> 02:33:35,130
So He's 18, right? Not a crazy
guy, just really romantic guy.

2575
02:33:35,131 --> 02:33:38,100
And it was not a scary breakup. So Anyway,
nice story. They got back together.

2576
02:33:38,101 --> 02:33:42,750
But um, what happened is, so
he goes to, so it's just the,

2577
02:33:42,751 --> 02:33:45,090
the only an 18 year old could
get it into his head to do this.

2578
02:33:45,480 --> 02:33:48,720
He gets on a plane and he doesn't
even know which country she went to.

2579
02:33:49,380 --> 02:33:51,240
So he just goes to Europe,
right.

2580
02:33:51,480 --> 02:33:55,710
He goes to Spain because he
speaks Spanish and starts asking.

2581
02:33:56,060 --> 02:34:00,870
He's like 10 days into his trip and so
he's in Barcelona and some tourists,

2582
02:34:01,040 --> 02:34:04,830
I hand him other tourists,
hand him a camera and said,
will you take our picture?

2583
02:34:05,220 --> 02:34:09,360
And he picks up the camera and he's taking
their picture in interframe walks his

2584
02:34:09,420 --> 02:34:11,220
ex girlfriend.
Right.

2585
02:34:11,520 --> 02:34:14,790
So he's like within 10
days he just found her in.

2586
02:34:14,940 --> 02:34:18,340
So what are the chances of that
happening? Well, it's pretty fucked.

2587
02:34:18,341 --> 02:34:21,110
Pretty is pretty small,
right? Um, but that kind of,

2588
02:34:21,310 --> 02:34:23,870
that stuff happens to people.
It would be,

2589
02:34:23,880 --> 02:34:28,570
it would be a miracle if high low
probability events never happened.

2590
02:34:29,080 --> 02:34:31,480
You know, it's like if, if it
will be a miracle, if no one,

2591
02:34:31,840 --> 02:34:36,000
no one in human history ever had a
story like that to tell, you know,

2592
02:34:37,790 --> 02:34:40,120
we're in a system where it's,
it's balanced.

2593
02:34:40,121 --> 02:34:43,070
There's bound to be very
low probability events or

2594
02:34:43,390 --> 02:34:45,040
it's just not fully evolved.

2595
02:34:45,041 --> 02:34:48,190
And this kid went on his instincts and
he tapped into the information in the

2596
02:34:48,191 --> 02:34:51,910
universe and he knew instinctively
where to go and he met his sweetheart,

2597
02:34:52,170 --> 02:34:53,710
God Damn Sandra Bullock movie.

2598
02:34:53,840 --> 02:34:57,480
If, if it's a, if it's an ability
that anyone should care about,

2599
02:34:57,510 --> 02:34:59,670
it should be testable.
It should be strong enough

2600
02:35:00,230 --> 02:35:00,590
tested.

2601
02:35:00,590 --> 02:35:05,360
But how can you test something when it's
an unique event that very rarely takes

2602
02:35:05,361 --> 02:35:08,960
place completely uncontrollable,
and it's something that's just a,

2603
02:35:08,961 --> 02:35:12,710
almost like a natural phenomenon
that rarely occurs. I mean,

2604
02:35:12,711 --> 02:35:16,130
how are you going to put something in a
testing environment in the environment

2605
02:35:16,131 --> 02:35:20,100
of a laboratory? Oh No. See if it really
does make sense that you think about,

2606
02:35:20,470 --> 02:35:23,570
I think it might be Sheldrake who's
doing this. Hey, there's a test of the,

2607
02:35:23,571 --> 02:35:26,450
of the phone call
phenomenon where you get,

2608
02:35:26,750 --> 02:35:28,880
people can subscribe to get there.

2609
02:35:30,140 --> 02:35:32,100
They get a call at the,

2610
02:35:32,101 --> 02:35:35,900
they enlist like their five closest
people in their lives and to call them at

2611
02:35:35,901 --> 02:35:37,520
random intervals,
you know,

2612
02:35:37,521 --> 02:35:40,070
I guess they did it disable
their caller id or whatever.

2613
02:35:40,370 --> 02:35:42,340
And you can just set
this up so that you know,

2614
02:35:42,430 --> 02:35:46,600
still not a true moment because they're,
they're acting on a, an experiment.

2615
02:35:46,780 --> 02:35:47,261
But then instead,

2616
02:35:47,261 --> 02:35:50,500
do you know that someone calling you
might not just be calling you because they

2617
02:35:50,501 --> 02:35:54,760
tapped into this idea of loving you and
they I this idea of missing you and that

2618
02:35:54,761 --> 02:35:58,510
is the tune that breaks through all the
way to you and causes you to look at

2619
02:35:58,511 --> 02:36:02,580
your phone right when
they turned in. That's not
replicatable. Replicatable. Yeah.

2620
02:36:03,130 --> 02:36:06,480
That's what goes for replicable.
Replicable. Yes. It's not, I mean,

2621
02:36:06,490 --> 02:36:08,080
you know what I'm saying?
I mean it's,

2622
02:36:08,290 --> 02:36:13,180
the idea of unique events isn't
disproven by experimenting with it.

2623
02:36:13,181 --> 02:36:16,540
Look, I've, I don't know that it's
true that sometimes, you know,

2624
02:36:16,541 --> 02:36:18,330
when someone is calling the,
but I've,

2625
02:36:18,340 --> 02:36:21,550
I've had the experience myself
but I haven't had in years.

2626
02:36:22,060 --> 02:36:24,820
It's been years and years since
I knew who was going to call me.

2627
02:36:24,821 --> 02:36:27,280
And I looked at it.
But I do remember it having,

2628
02:36:27,490 --> 02:36:30,850
having it happened in my life several
times would if it's something that just,

2629
02:36:30,880 --> 02:36:33,880
you know, want to fucking summer
solstice, the planets are aligned,

2630
02:36:34,030 --> 02:36:38,210
your own biology, you have
a certain amount of water in
your system and boom, the,

2631
02:36:38,211 --> 02:36:41,080
there's a certain amount of love and the
thought gets through. Is that possible?

2632
02:36:41,390 --> 02:36:46,130
Well, well sure it's possible. But
the question is what even though,

2633
02:36:46,131 --> 02:36:47,730
even if it's true,

2634
02:36:48,210 --> 02:36:52,950
given this description doesn't really seem
to matter because then they're all so,

2635
02:36:52,951 --> 02:36:54,600
so it's,
cause it's not fascinating would know,

2636
02:36:54,601 --> 02:36:56,370
but it doesn't mean it doesn't count.
It's like it's not,

2637
02:36:56,371 --> 02:36:57,840
it's not a matter of just,

2638
02:36:58,290 --> 02:37:01,500
it's not a sign of how connected you are
with the person because sometimes you

2639
02:37:01,501 --> 02:37:04,320
know, it's somebody you
don't even like. Right.

2640
02:37:05,580 --> 02:37:10,580
It's not a measure of how crucial it
is that they reach you at that moment

2641
02:37:10,651 --> 02:37:12,540
because sometimes it's completely trivial.

2642
02:37:12,870 --> 02:37:16,430
And then other times when someone really
had get ahold of you because you're,

2643
02:37:16,580 --> 02:37:17,810
you know,
dad was sick,

2644
02:37:18,440 --> 02:37:23,300
they couldn't find you and you are just
blissfully ignorant of the fact that the

2645
02:37:23,301 --> 02:37:25,820
closest person in your life is having
a medical emergency. Right. Well,

2646
02:37:25,821 --> 02:37:29,000
no one's saying that it works all the
time and that because it works on a blue

2647
02:37:29,001 --> 02:37:32,120
moon that it can't, you know, but
that, but then that's not working well,

2648
02:37:32,121 --> 02:37:34,970
it's not that it's not working,
it just doesn't work all the time.

2649
02:37:34,970 --> 02:37:37,580
It's a rare event. Is it? Is, are there,

2650
02:37:37,581 --> 02:37:40,700
is it possible that there are rare
events like that or do you think it's all

2651
02:37:40,701 --> 02:37:44,410
just, well, no, but they're
much more likely scientifically
to be as much as well,

2652
02:37:44,420 --> 02:37:46,340
given this,
given what we're talking about now,

2653
02:37:46,341 --> 02:37:50,860
this is all much more likely
to be coincidence. I mean,
it's just, it's just, it's,

2654
02:37:50,861 --> 02:37:53,750
it's quite you. You don't have that many
people in your life. You think about,

2655
02:37:54,380 --> 02:37:58,220
you think about them. You don't have that
many people in your life who call you.

2656
02:37:58,280 --> 02:38:01,130
I mean, we just were actually run
the numbers on this one problem.

2657
02:38:01,160 --> 02:38:04,700
Is that we have very bad
intuitions of probability.

2658
02:38:04,701 --> 02:38:08,150
So if you heard of the the
birthday party problem, no.

2659
02:38:08,420 --> 02:38:10,740
So if I got a room,

2660
02:38:10,741 --> 02:38:14,300
if it puts you in a room of
just random strangers, right?

2661
02:38:14,870 --> 02:38:19,870
How many would I have to have in the
room for you to be confident that two

2662
02:38:20,151 --> 02:38:24,530
people in the room had the same birthday?
She's so that you'd be willing to bet.

2663
02:38:24,830 --> 02:38:28,360
I'll bet you they would have
to be thousands for me. Okay.

2664
02:38:28,820 --> 02:38:33,110
And that would just be gas.
Okay. So that's, so that's
basically everyone's guests.

2665
02:38:33,170 --> 02:38:36,650
That is just,
there's 365 days in the year.

2666
02:38:36,680 --> 02:38:40,670
We've got to get two people on the same
day. That's going to be a lot of people,

2667
02:38:40,700 --> 02:38:42,320
right?
The truth is,

2668
02:38:43,310 --> 02:38:47,720
and this is just the fact that
if you get 23 people in the room,

2669
02:38:48,350 --> 02:38:53,350
you have crossed the 50% threshold so
that it's more likely than not that two of

2670
02:38:54,681 --> 02:38:57,470
them have the same birthday.
That's amazing. 23 people. Now,

2671
02:38:57,471 --> 02:39:00,020
the reason now what's
crucial to understand is that

2672
02:39:02,090 --> 02:39:05,600
it's, it's the crucial piece.

2673
02:39:05,601 --> 02:39:08,360
And this actually goes to this deflate.

2674
02:39:08,361 --> 02:39:13,361
So many conspiracy theories and other
bad ideas is that it's absolutely crucial

2675
02:39:13,761 --> 02:39:17,450
that we didn't specify which birthday,
right? So it's any two birthdays,

2676
02:39:17,480 --> 02:39:22,300
any single birthday, any
two people, and any single
birthday, 23. And that makes it,

2677
02:39:22,370 --> 02:39:25,160
that makes it, that changes the
game entirely. But if I said,

2678
02:39:25,520 --> 02:39:29,780
how many people do I need in a
room to find one with my birthday,

2679
02:39:30,380 --> 02:39:32,210
that changes it. Right? Um,

2680
02:39:33,020 --> 02:39:36,290
but at any two people on any
given birthday, it's, yeah,

2681
02:39:36,291 --> 02:39:39,680
if you go with just your birthday,
that's thousands though.

2682
02:39:40,350 --> 02:39:44,950
I don't offhand know what that would
be, but anyway, that's a so, so anyway,

2683
02:39:45,290 --> 02:39:49,320
our intuitions, our
intuitions are bad, uh,

2684
02:39:49,330 --> 02:39:52,400
about probability. And so, um,

2685
02:39:52,820 --> 02:39:55,370
and so when you look at
like nine 11 truth stuff,

2686
02:39:56,330 --> 02:40:01,330
it's so much about finding these
little anomalies that strike people as

2687
02:40:01,641 --> 02:40:06,641
intuitively highly unlikely and
in desperate need of explanation.

2688
02:40:07,160 --> 02:40:10,450
Whereas you can always
look at, at, at any,

2689
02:40:10,760 --> 02:40:15,760
anything you look at after the
fact can be described as a miracle.

2690
02:40:15,990 --> 02:40:17,070
So like I could say to you,

2691
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:22,860
what are the chances that all of the
wires and objects on this desk would be

2692
02:40:22,861 --> 02:40:27,280
exactly in this position on this doesn't
amount of creationists argument for the,

2693
02:40:27,410 --> 02:40:31,420
the evolution of the eyeball. Like
how's it, yeah, so a bit, but at least,

2694
02:40:31,421 --> 02:40:33,390
so there's actually more to
talk about there. I mean,

2695
02:40:34,580 --> 02:40:37,870
it is kind of inscrutable how this,

2696
02:40:38,070 --> 02:40:42,840
this stuff happens
through um, uh, genetic,

2697
02:40:42,841 --> 02:40:43,674
uh,

2698
02:40:43,800 --> 02:40:44,633
uh,

2699
02:40:45,150 --> 02:40:49,870
mutation and, and environmental pressure.
But we can tell that story, but that,

2700
02:40:49,880 --> 02:40:52,680
but this is just a post
hoc after the fact.

2701
02:40:52,681 --> 02:40:57,681
I say this is just inexplicably that the
wires are tangled and exactly this way.

2702
02:40:58,170 --> 02:41:00,120
If you were going to kind
of randomly do this again,

2703
02:41:00,121 --> 02:41:02,790
you'd never get them in this position.
Um,

2704
02:41:02,910 --> 02:41:05,350
but of course it's completely meaningless.
There's not it,

2705
02:41:05,530 --> 02:41:08,520
the wires have to be some way.
They just happened to be this way.

2706
02:41:09,030 --> 02:41:10,140
And I'm putting a,

2707
02:41:10,170 --> 02:41:15,170
a morale completely gratuitous burden
on you to explain the fact that they're

2708
02:41:17,041 --> 02:41:19,950
just this way. Right?
And so in any situations,

2709
02:41:20,190 --> 02:41:22,800
certainly any situation is complicated.
As September 11th,

2710
02:41:23,190 --> 02:41:26,220
you're going to see all these anomalies.
So you see, you know, the fact that,

2711
02:41:26,430 --> 02:41:28,140
how do you explain the fact that

2712
02:41:28,900 --> 02:41:29,733
mmm.

2713
02:41:30,750 --> 02:41:32,850
You know,
on that day we,

2714
02:41:32,851 --> 02:41:37,851
the navy was running a fighter jet test
and the F and we had f six teens that

2715
02:41:37,891 --> 02:41:41,610
were out over the ocean or whatever,
whatever the thing is, you know,

2716
02:41:41,611 --> 02:41:43,050
they only run that test,
you know,

2717
02:41:43,051 --> 02:41:47,580
two days a year and they were running
at that day, right. You could,

2718
02:41:47,730 --> 02:41:50,930
if it wasn't that anomaly, you'd find
some other anomaly. You can always,

2719
02:41:50,960 --> 02:41:53,370
if as long as you're
picking after the fact,

2720
02:41:53,371 --> 02:41:56,730
you can always find something weird that
is in desperate need of explanation,

2721
02:41:57,090 --> 02:41:59,790
have their bins to stay statistical.

2722
02:42:00,030 --> 02:42:04,230
Have there been studies that have
proven statistics on people knowing that

2723
02:42:04,231 --> 02:42:05,490
people are watching them?

2724
02:42:05,850 --> 02:42:10,260
I've heard there's been studies people
say if you had Rupert Sheldrake on here,

2725
02:42:10,261 --> 02:42:13,260
he would say yes, but you
would say, no. I, I would,

2726
02:42:13,320 --> 02:42:18,320
I'm not close enough to the research
to have any sense to some degree.

2727
02:42:19,330 --> 02:42:22,460
Some substantiated though. Well, you just
have to take people at their word. So,

2728
02:42:22,480 --> 02:42:25,950
so like I've talked to Rupert,
I don't think Rupert is,

2729
02:42:25,951 --> 02:42:29,040
I don't think he's a conscious fraud.
I think he's a smart guy.

2730
02:42:29,970 --> 02:42:31,080
He's a very earnest guy.

2731
02:42:31,770 --> 02:42:36,080
Is he lying about what he thinks he
knows or has he self deceived or is he,

2732
02:42:36,081 --> 02:42:40,680
has he been deceived by
unscrupulous people or is
there a Shim bias? Yeah, yeah,

2733
02:42:40,681 --> 02:42:42,510
exactly. So it's just the, the,

2734
02:42:42,550 --> 02:42:47,550
the problem is that it's so fringe and
so many people want to believe it's true

2735
02:42:50,070 --> 02:42:54,540
that it's easy to worry that
it hasn't really been fully,

2736
02:42:55,010 --> 02:42:56,110
um,
you know,

2737
02:42:56,290 --> 02:43:00,000
the bushes haven't been beaten hard enough
to find all the errors and the biases

2738
02:43:00,001 --> 02:43:03,900
and the frauds.
But if there's a real phenomenon there,

2739
02:43:03,901 --> 02:43:08,901
it should be testable and it shouldn't
be vulnerable to the slightest quirk of

2740
02:43:09,811 --> 02:43:10,650
Oh,
that,

2741
02:43:11,080 --> 02:43:14,620
that experiment or had a bad vibe or it
was too skeptical and therefore killed

2742
02:43:14,621 --> 02:43:17,550
the effect. Um, it just, uh,

2743
02:43:17,560 --> 02:43:21,430
especially when you're talking about
people who actually wheel, if, if, if,

2744
02:43:21,490 --> 02:43:24,230
is it possible that someone
could be the experiment there?

2745
02:43:24,240 --> 02:43:27,400
Could I have a bad vibe and beast too
skeptical set up and they got him a

2746
02:43:27,401 --> 02:43:31,140
negative energy. You could, you
could set up an experiment where I'm,

2747
02:43:31,720 --> 02:43:35,200
the experimenter was 5,000 miles
away or had really good vibes.

2748
02:43:35,201 --> 02:43:38,350
You could put the true believers
in, you know, kind of the coach.

2749
02:43:38,380 --> 02:43:42,790
You can put a completely friendly coach
who was, you know, Sylvia Brown, you know,

2750
02:43:42,820 --> 02:43:45,700
crazy, fraudulent psychic, Sylvia Brown.

2751
02:43:46,180 --> 02:43:50,350
She could be there working
her magic, you know, and,

2752
02:43:50,351 --> 02:43:53,350
and just, just helping
everybody. You could, you could,

2753
02:43:53,351 --> 02:43:56,380
you could surround them with only true
believers if you wanted to. You could,

2754
02:43:56,381 --> 02:43:59,860
you could design the experiment
in such a way. Uh, um,

2755
02:44:00,130 --> 02:44:02,350
so you can make the vibes
as nice as you want.

2756
02:44:02,380 --> 02:44:05,170
It's just that that's anyone who's,
there's a,

2757
02:44:05,171 --> 02:44:10,171
there's a fundamentally unscientific
attitude you get from many,

2758
02:44:10,511 --> 02:44:13,510
many people in this area of the
human conversation, which is,

2759
02:44:14,140 --> 02:44:17,870
science has reductionistic.
It's, it's, uh,

2760
02:44:18,370 --> 02:44:22,150
hypercritical. It's life destroying. It's,

2761
02:44:22,270 --> 02:44:27,270
there's this whole area of truth that
science and principal can't touch.

2762
02:44:28,300 --> 02:44:31,150
And that's just not true. It's like
if it, if it's a real phenomenon,

2763
02:44:31,210 --> 02:44:33,160
science is the best way to touch it.

2764
02:44:33,161 --> 02:44:36,220
There's certain things that it's hard
to figure out how you would do the

2765
02:44:36,221 --> 02:44:36,791
experiments.

2766
02:44:36,791 --> 02:44:40,330
Harder to figure out how to get it in
the lab and how to get it to where the

2767
02:44:40,331 --> 02:44:44,060
person who's doing the experiments not
being influenced by the fact you're,

2768
02:44:44,100 --> 02:44:47,490
you're experimenting on them.
Yes, exactly. So there are
certain, so you know, the,

2769
02:44:47,500 --> 02:44:51,130
the scientific research I've done is with
functional magnetic resonance imaging

2770
02:44:51,131 --> 02:44:56,131
where you have to put people in an MRI
scanner and it's hugely limits what you

2771
02:44:57,671 --> 02:45:01,790
can study because there's the peep people
can't move. You know, if you move you,

2772
02:45:01,810 --> 02:45:06,610
you destroy the image.
So you got to lie in a clattering machine,

2773
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:07,480
uh,

2774
02:45:07,480 --> 02:45:12,480
motionless and do some cognitive task
that you can do looking at computer

2775
02:45:15,040 --> 02:45:18,910
goggles or, you know,
looking at a mirror, um,

2776
02:45:19,120 --> 02:45:23,040
and across your feet out into the
room. It's a, it limits you. So, so,

2777
02:45:23,110 --> 02:45:25,450
so a brain scanning
experiment is hugely limited.

2778
02:45:25,451 --> 02:45:28,060
You can't put somebody on their
bike and have them, you know,

2779
02:45:28,090 --> 02:45:31,180
ride off into the distance,
uh, while scanning their brain.

2780
02:45:31,210 --> 02:45:35,170
But though those things aside,
you can,

2781
02:45:35,570 --> 02:45:38,710
and here we're not talking
about experiments with
those kinds of limitations.

2782
02:45:38,720 --> 02:45:39,553
You can,

2783
02:45:39,730 --> 02:45:44,490
if people have an ability to know
who's calling on the phone, uh,

2784
02:45:45,100 --> 02:45:48,880
if there's even one guy on planet
earth who knows who has this ability,

2785
02:45:50,260 --> 02:45:54,700
it should be, we could easily design an
experiment that would demonstrate that.

2786
02:45:55,150 --> 02:45:57,880
And the people who claim they're there
are people who really claimed these

2787
02:45:57,881 --> 02:46:02,860
abilities. The claimant a repeatable
basis. Yeah. Yeah. There are people who,

2788
02:46:04,170 --> 02:46:08,830
well, there they're the sort of kind
of shyster western new age psychics

2789
02:46:10,630 --> 02:46:11,500
who,
uh,

2790
02:46:12,640 --> 02:46:17,280
I'm not sure, but I, I, I imagine they
just never submit to being tested, um,

2791
02:46:18,330 --> 02:46:21,420
for obvious reasons.
And then there are there,

2792
02:46:21,480 --> 02:46:25,920
then there's the kind of Buddhist Hindu,
Yogi,

2793
02:46:25,950 --> 02:46:30,690
contemplative world where people imagine
that great meditators have developed

2794
02:46:30,691 --> 02:46:34,500
these abilities. And even some
of the meditators will, you know,

2795
02:46:34,501 --> 02:46:38,910
wink wink suggests that they probably
have these abilities but are just too

2796
02:46:38,970 --> 02:46:42,060
humble to demonstrate them.
But,

2797
02:46:42,210 --> 02:46:46,810
and there's sort of a kind of religious
taboo against demonstrating them or, or,

2798
02:46:47,400 --> 02:46:52,020
or challenging them or are submitting
them to test. But in, yeah, in the,

2799
02:46:52,021 --> 02:46:55,400
in the, in the contemplative
world among Buddhists and,

2800
02:46:55,410 --> 02:46:57,030
and an Indian Yogis,

2801
02:46:57,750 --> 02:47:01,380
there's actually a straightforward
path to developing these skills.

2802
02:47:01,650 --> 02:47:04,200
I mean there's, there's a recipe
you could go into your, you know,

2803
02:47:04,350 --> 02:47:08,820
you can go ask the Dalai Lama,
how could I learn to read people's minds?

2804
02:47:09,300 --> 02:47:12,170
He has an answer to that question.
I mean it's not like, well it's,

2805
02:47:12,210 --> 02:47:15,240
it's just a matter of whether you're
gifted or not. Now there's actually,

2806
02:47:15,241 --> 02:47:16,140
this is like you can get,

2807
02:47:16,170 --> 02:47:20,090
you can basically get a phd
and reading people's minds in,

2808
02:47:20,190 --> 02:47:24,660
among Buddhists and Hindus.
So the people who've done that,

2809
02:47:24,661 --> 02:47:26,960
why don't they get tested?
It's not cause it,

2810
02:47:27,030 --> 02:47:30,120
cause what they're claiming is not
an ability to make a random number.

2811
02:47:30,121 --> 02:47:32,220
Generator jumped slightly.

2812
02:47:32,221 --> 02:47:36,960
If they've got 5,000 people sitting
next to them also doing it, they,

2813
02:47:36,961 --> 02:47:37,340
they,

2814
02:47:37,340 --> 02:47:42,340
they claim just huge abilities are
possible for meditators who have reached

2815
02:47:43,591 --> 02:47:45,710
certain levels of concentration.
I mean there are people who,

2816
02:47:46,500 --> 02:47:47,333
who

2817
02:47:48,850 --> 02:47:52,300
the stories are as crazy as anything
you've heard about like remote viewing.

2818
02:47:52,660 --> 02:47:56,180
That's probably the craziest shit
of all time, right? Is that Beverly?

2819
02:47:56,220 --> 02:48:01,060
It is proven. That's never
been proven. Just vague enough.

2820
02:48:01,180 --> 02:48:05,260
Well first of all there are,
there are magicians like um,

2821
02:48:06,050 --> 02:48:09,670
so the British magician Derren brown.
I gotta pee again.

2822
02:48:10,560 --> 02:48:13,080
I forgot to drink in this gigantic.
I'm so,

2823
02:48:13,081 --> 02:48:18,081
I'm so well let's do non psychic that I
forgot I had to pay as how in touch I am

2824
02:48:19,801 --> 02:48:21,480
with with the physical reality.

2825
02:48:21,510 --> 02:48:24,000
This has been a really
fascinating conversation man.

2826
02:48:24,001 --> 02:48:27,510
We could go on for hours and hours. How
long was this again? Almost three hours.

2827
02:48:27,560 --> 02:48:31,250
Oh really? Yeah. Yeah. Well yeah
we're five minutes away from three ls.

2828
02:48:31,270 --> 02:48:35,860
Hope we didn't kill our audience. People
love this shit. Look, I think your,

2829
02:48:35,880 --> 02:48:37,180
your,
your,

2830
02:48:37,800 --> 02:48:41,040
your devotion to the scientific method
and exploring everything is very

2831
02:48:41,041 --> 02:48:41,551
admirable.

2832
02:48:41,551 --> 02:48:44,760
It's very interesting and unique and
we've never had anybody on the show that

2833
02:48:44,761 --> 02:48:48,700
breaks things down in that way before.
It's really, really been really cool. Um,

2834
02:48:48,870 --> 02:48:51,390
follow him on Twitter,

We didn't even touch a real pleasure.

2842
02:49:16,831 --> 02:49:18,570
We didn't talk about martial arts.

2843
02:49:18,640 --> 02:49:22,620
Who got all up in Jihad and a little
bit of drugs. It was great man. Awesome,
