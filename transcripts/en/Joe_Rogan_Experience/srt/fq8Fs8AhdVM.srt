1
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:09,280
And

2
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:10,940
we're live event words.

3
00:00:10,941 --> 00:00:11,440
Ladies and gentlemen.

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,960
You're one of those dudes that has
that book cover for your phone.

5
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,910
I tried to rock the
book cover after awhile.

6
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:18,171
I'm like,

7
00:00:18,171 --> 00:00:19,910
what am I doing here with this extra step?

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,220
I got to open up a book
to get to my phone.

9
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:27,650
I like it because I forget things a lot
so like I don't like having a wallet and

10
00:00:27,651 --> 00:00:30,770
a phone when I leave somewhere
like especially even in the house.

11
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,690
I leave the house in my phone but I
don't have my cash on my car just so I've

12
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:35,511
got a solution for you.

13
00:00:35,511 --> 00:00:37,130
It's called a motherfucking fanny pack.

14
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:38,541
That's right.

15
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:39,070
Even worse.

16
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:39,770
You're a cool dude.

17
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:44,120
You think you're cool enough to rock
one of these like are you cool enough to

18
00:00:44,121 --> 00:00:49,121
get past the social pariah aspect of
this bag that you wear around your waist?

19
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,390
I don't have that much shit with me most
of the time it's not that much shit is

20
00:00:53,391 --> 00:00:54,230
a lot of shit in here,

21
00:00:54,231 --> 00:00:55,610
but this is a weird day.

22
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:59,210
I have like keys and I have
a knife in there and stuff,

23
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,030
but most of the time it's just light.

24
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:03,140
I travel light with that.

25
00:01:03,141 --> 00:01:03,591
Look at that.

26
00:01:03,591 --> 00:01:03,980
Who's gay?

27
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:04,813
Who's that?

28
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,910
I'd be like Calavo from Egos.

29
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:07,890
Uh,

30
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:09,110
I have no idea what he just said.

31
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:10,160
Popular Rapper,

32
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,120
but that is a ridiculous,

33
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:12,003
is he a popular fellow?

34
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,333
I know.

35
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,890
I'm an old man to listen
to the Allman brothers.

36
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:16,783
All right.

37
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:20,690
But that one that he's
got on his preposterous.

38
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,020
You might as well have a laptop
hanging around his waist,

39
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:25,730
like holes in his jeans.

40
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:25,911
Yeah,

41
00:01:25,911 --> 00:01:26,601
that's ridiculous.

42
00:01:26,601 --> 00:01:26,901
What'd you get?

43
00:01:26,901 --> 00:01:27,651
Attacked by a tiger,

44
00:01:27,651 --> 00:01:28,240
sir.

45
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,690
Got a lot them jewelry.

46
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,720
All the jewelry in the 80s yeah,

47
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:33,500
he's kind of ridiculous looking.

48
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:34,550
Go,

49
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:35,330
but make that,

50
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:37,610
make that bigger again so I can
take a look at this gentleman

51
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:40,971
light version two.

52
00:01:40,971 --> 00:01:42,080
I probably could have
found a better place.

53
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,160
He's got a lot going on.

54
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,810
Those pants are preposterous.

55
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,340
That's the most preposterous thing.

56
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:47,780
Like I guess the shoes.

57
00:01:47,781 --> 00:01:48,560
If you were like,

58
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,281
you want to go out,

59
00:01:49,281 --> 00:01:50,510
but you also want to go bowling,

60
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:52,240
you might wear the shoes.

61
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,590
This is a rose fascinates go.

62
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:56,870
I can't say anything
bad about the jewelry.

63
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,070
I'm not into the jewelry.

64
00:01:58,071 --> 00:01:58,461
I mean I'm,

65
00:01:58,461 --> 00:01:59,211
that's not my thing.

66
00:01:59,211 --> 00:02:00,770
But he looks like he's well appointed.

67
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:02,060
Two watches on though.

68
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:02,830
Fuck yeah,

69
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:03,500
I'm balling.

70
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,110
Hashtag [inaudible] I think the
one on the right is probably just,

71
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,310
is that a bracelet bracelet?

72
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,140
Just a fancy ass bracelet.

73
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,041
Uh,

74
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:11,240
but the pants are ridiculous.

75
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:11,840
I don't,

76
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,330
how the fuck did that ever get started
where people were ripped up pants.

77
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:15,890
I tried to talk to
Brendan Schaub about that.

78
00:02:15,891 --> 00:02:16,724
That dumb motherfucker.

79
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,540
Where's those [inaudible]
they did a long time.

80
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,300
Exactly.

81
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,450
It's been going on for a while.

82
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:23,630
Music videos.

83
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,471
I just like,

84
00:02:24,471 --> 00:02:25,520
what are you doing man?

85
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,810
It's like Pat Benatar.

86
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:28,430
I don't have any fashion tastes.

87
00:02:28,431 --> 00:02:29,264
Don't listen to me,

88
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:31,130
but when I'm Moxham some shit,

89
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,240
you might want to listen to me.

90
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,980
Like don't wear what I wear.

91
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:34,670
Like,

92
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:35,503
you know,

93
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,770
don't just don't,

94
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,280
I mostly wear either I'll wear like these
things which are like a trail running

95
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:43,603
sneakers.

96
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:47,510
They get no sneaker cred or I'll
wear like converse all star.

97
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:47,631
Oh,

98
00:02:47,631 --> 00:02:48,170
look at this.

99
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:49,670
Look at this teen beat.

100
00:02:49,671 --> 00:02:50,540
Donnie Wahlberg.

101
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:51,021
Yeah,

102
00:02:51,021 --> 00:02:51,854
exactly.

103
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:55,040
How does his hog not just slipped
right out of that one on the right,

104
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,150
right hand side.

105
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:59,120
That one on the right hand side come on.

106
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,190
Silly Fox

107
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:02,440
like I don't know.

108
00:03:02,441 --> 00:03:05,350
I see that and I feel like it guys will
probably went in a thong under that too.

109
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:06,371
Yeah,

110
00:03:06,371 --> 00:03:09,610
I would imagine there's something
going on like with with the women,

111
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,161
like it's,

112
00:03:10,161 --> 00:03:12,870
it's so much nicer to me at all.

113
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:13,840
I'm going to tell you right now,

114
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:15,010
this is where I'm a hypocrite.

115
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:17,230
Like with Beyonce right there.

116
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:18,670
She fills it out.

117
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:18,921
Yeah,

118
00:03:18,921 --> 00:03:19,860
she does that.

119
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:24,910
See that's kind of different because like
a woman's legs and everything are very

120
00:03:25,061 --> 00:03:25,900
sexual.

121
00:03:25,901 --> 00:03:26,171
Right?

122
00:03:26,171 --> 00:03:27,580
So you've see extra leg.

123
00:03:27,581 --> 00:03:30,850
It's like just shut your
mouth and take the bonus.

124
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:31,810
Yeah.

125
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:32,110
Right.

126
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:32,650
Yeah.

127
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,000
You don't want to complain about it,

128
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:35,950
but a dude wearing something like that,

129
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,060
it's like it's,

130
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,140
it's literally like,

131
00:03:38,141 --> 00:03:39,010
well not literally,

132
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:41,650
but it's so much like
a guy wearing a dress.

133
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:43,210
It's a fashion for women.

134
00:03:43,211 --> 00:03:45,430
I believe it's trying way too hard.

135
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:45,791
Like this.

136
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:46,624
Look at this fellow.

137
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:49,690
He this like seems like the 80s though.

138
00:03:49,691 --> 00:03:51,310
Cause he's got a suit jacket on.

139
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,070
I mean you can look at
the quality of picture.

140
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:53,780
Yeah,

141
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,340
right.

142
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:54,850
That's true.

143
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:55,640
That hairstyle.

144
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,730
The suit suit jackets never came back.

145
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:58,790
Got Patches too.

146
00:03:58,980 --> 00:03:59,140
Oh,

147
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,100
he's got patches.

148
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:00,371
Yeah.

149
00:04:00,371 --> 00:04:02,260
I remember when they used
to do all that art on the,

150
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:03,330
on the genes to,

151
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:04,451
yeah,

152
00:04:04,451 --> 00:04:05,590
that was those pants.

153
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,240
Those pants were ridiculous,

154
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,340
but ripped up pants.

155
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:14,300
Men allegedly ripped up pants and,

156
00:04:14,301 --> 00:04:14,481
and,

157
00:04:14,481 --> 00:04:15,200
and skinny Jean.

158
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:15,310
I,

159
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:15,840
I'm like,

160
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,030
I'm still 100% against skinny jeans.

161
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:20,960
You know what I say that
I'm against gain jeans,

162
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:23,090
but I wear these things
called barbell jeans.

163
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:23,983
You ever wear those?

164
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,450
They look like skinny jeans because they,

165
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,440
they're tight to you.

166
00:04:27,441 --> 00:04:28,274
But they have,

167
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:29,420
oh,

168
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:29,880
I don't mind.

169
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,130
I know this is,

170
00:04:31,131 --> 00:04:31,964
they're made out of,

171
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:32,500
yeah.

172
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,333
Shit.

173
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,211
They got some,

174
00:04:34,211 --> 00:04:34,510
some,

175
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,710
some elasticity.

176
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:36,580
Oh yeah man.

177
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,950
They're like wearing sweat pants like
you don't fit if you don't feel you go

178
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:43,360
throw kicks in him like
you could like for real.

179
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:44,620
I'm too old for it now.

180
00:04:44,621 --> 00:04:45,470
I'm not going to get my leg.

181
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:45,810
No,

182
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:46,041
no,

183
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:46,360
no.

184
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,193
Do you train anymore?

185
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:47,411
Yeah,

186
00:04:47,411 --> 00:04:48,244
I still train.

187
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,690
I haven't trained the past few
months have been a little bit hard,

188
00:04:52,691 --> 00:04:54,700
but now that things are settling down,

189
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:56,140
settling into this new life,

190
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,040
um,

191
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,873
things are good.

192
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,360
Um,

193
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,590
been training with Joe a lot.

194
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,453
Schilling.

195
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:00,701
Oh,

196
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:01,030
okay.

197
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,290
Quickie garlic just moved out here.

198
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:03,160
And you were in that area?

199
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,410
In the downtown area and Eagle Rock.

200
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:05,651
Oh,

201
00:05:05,651 --> 00:05:05,981
nice.

202
00:05:05,981 --> 00:05:06,790
Nice.

203
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:07,623
I like it over there.

204
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,620
The yard's great players.

205
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:09,550
The Yard is awesome.

206
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,780
That's a great place to train.

207
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:12,010
Been going there for a while.

208
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,920
I saw Mickey training
with Joe on Instagram.

209
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:15,370
Yup.

210
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:16,090
Yeah.

211
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:16,481
Nice.

212
00:05:16,481 --> 00:05:16,991
So sound.

213
00:05:16,991 --> 00:05:17,860
They're too smart.

214
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:18,723
Good move for him.

215
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,421
That's what he needs,

216
00:05:19,421 --> 00:05:19,631
right?

217
00:05:19,631 --> 00:05:20,770
It's striking his ground game.

218
00:05:20,771 --> 00:05:21,370
He's very good.

219
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:21,551
Yeah,

220
00:05:21,551 --> 00:05:22,630
his ground is really good.

221
00:05:22,631 --> 00:05:25,660
He moved down here about a
month ago and he actually,

222
00:05:25,661 --> 00:05:26,530
he's my roommate now.

223
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,330
No Shit.

224
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:28,690
And you live with Micky Gall is,

225
00:05:28,691 --> 00:05:28,871
yeah,

226
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:29,704
he came out.

227
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:31,720
That's cool.

228
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:32,020
Oh,

229
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:32,853
that's gotta be fun.

230
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,873
It's fun.

231
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:34,900
It's fun.

232
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:37,450
Also because he's so young.

233
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,640
It's almost like having a son
that is doing what you did.

234
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,050
You know,

235
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:46,960
I took great resource for him
to be able to talk to you.

236
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,640
Ask Your questions about the game.

237
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,860
We sit around and watch
fights sometimes it's good.

238
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:51,460
Eve Edwards,

239
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:55,210
I saw you fight and hook and
shoot in like the fucking sixties.

240
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:58,820
Like you were wearing bell bottoms
when he came out to the cage?

241
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,050
I was,

242
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:00,710
there was one.

243
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:01,250
Yeah,

244
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,900
I remember you fought Aaron Riley.

245
00:06:02,901 --> 00:06:04,400
I think you were like 12 years old.

246
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:05,563
How old were you?

247
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,730
I was about 20.

248
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,530
I was still a kid.

249
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:11,180
Those were good fights man.

250
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:12,410
Those were good fights.

251
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:13,551
That was,

252
00:06:13,551 --> 00:06:13,850
um,

253
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:17,810
I was watching that fight actually Mickey
and I watched that fight together a

254
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:17,860
couple of weeks ago.

255
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:18,290
Um,

256
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:19,123
is it weird?

257
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,740
It is weird because it seemed like you,

258
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,870
does it seem like another life?

259
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,340
It's kind of another life,

260
00:06:25,341 --> 00:06:25,530
right?

261
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:26,990
Is like how old are you now?

262
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,610
I'm 41 when you,

263
00:06:28,611 --> 00:06:30,890
when you think back about yourself at 20,

264
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:36,310
like how much memory do you really
have that he got like little flashes.

265
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:37,161
Like,

266
00:06:37,161 --> 00:06:41,420
I could see little pick images of h and
then I have a narrative that it play out

267
00:06:41,421 --> 00:06:44,540
in my head that I think
happened and so I can repeat it.

268
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,260
Here we go.

269
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:50,090
Look at that 20 year old bouncing around.

270
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,890
Wow Dude.

271
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:52,641
Yeah,

272
00:06:52,641 --> 00:06:52,860
no,

273
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:53,693
look at it here.

274
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:54,440
Wow.

275
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:54,651
Yeah.

276
00:06:54,651 --> 00:06:56,580
You had like does curl
thing going on and yeah,

277
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:58,190
they're Kool Moe Dee thing going on too.

278
00:06:58,990 --> 00:06:59,470
I was,

279
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:00,303
you know,

280
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:01,460
I was representing,

281
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,170
wow.

282
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,730
I just fighting those really surely days.

283
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:06,891
This was,

284
00:07:06,891 --> 00:07:07,724
um,

285
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:10,190
Jeff Osborne show can shoot.

286
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,090
That was the first time
you were in a knife fight.

287
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:15,260
He's a really good commentator,

288
00:07:15,261 --> 00:07:15,830
man.

289
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:16,730
Is he working?

290
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:17,540
I don't know.

291
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,640
I know he just shut down hook and shoot.

292
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:20,330
Yeah,

293
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:21,080
it's gone.

294
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,400
And I don't know what Jeff is doing.

295
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:23,300
I know he had a lot.

296
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:23,810
He was,

297
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,670
he was involved with
pro wrestling a lot too.

298
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:26,900
Um,

299
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,700
but now I haven't spoken
to him in a long time.

300
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:31,910
I had a couple of shows with him in
the UFC when I first came aboard.

301
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:32,510
He was,

302
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,920
he was doing the UFC back in the day.

303
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:34,460
Yeah.

304
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:34,671
I,

305
00:07:34,671 --> 00:07:35,504
um,

306
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,650
I was just Wah.

307
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:37,483
That's another thing.

308
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:38,271
That's another thing.

309
00:07:38,271 --> 00:07:39,710
Going back and watching these old fights,

310
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,390
I've been on fight pass
and I was watching,

311
00:07:41,391 --> 00:07:43,790
I think it was like
you're [inaudible] wow.

312
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:44,570
Um,

313
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:46,010
when Louisiana,

314
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:49,250
when boosted match and Linden that card.

315
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:49,521
Yeah.

316
00:07:49,521 --> 00:07:50,670
That was the restart fight.

317
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:51,411
Exactly.

318
00:07:51,411 --> 00:07:53,690
Remember that on that card?

319
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:56,330
My Tim and I tapped him again.

320
00:07:56,331 --> 00:07:59,120
Big John kind of screwed it up and yeah,

321
00:07:59,121 --> 00:07:59,840
man,

322
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,230
you know that that was the early days too.

323
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:06,050
I think nowadays I think big
John would have just said,

324
00:08:06,051 --> 00:08:06,221
no,

325
00:08:06,221 --> 00:08:06,320
no,

326
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:06,620
no.

327
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,200
Yeah,

328
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:07,690
yeah,

329
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:07,851
yeah,

330
00:08:07,851 --> 00:08:08,540
absolutely.

331
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,920
I mean we were all learning back then,

332
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:16,760
but that was still like UFC middleweight
championship and it was like they had

333
00:08:16,761 --> 00:08:18,740
had 30 plus shows.

334
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,693
It was like,

335
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,570
it was something that you
wouldn't expect for sure.

336
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:26,300
Lynn Lynn was so is so crazy.

337
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,630
Didn't he bite somebody and
when he was wrestling Lynn Lynn,

338
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:30,200
yeah.

339
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:30,750
Yeah.

340
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:34,520
In the wrestling days he bit somebody
here's boosting launch versus chocolate

341
00:08:34,521 --> 00:08:35,120
Dell.

342
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,080
This is a different one.

343
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:36,981
Yeah.

344
00:08:36,981 --> 00:08:41,981
This was a fight where boosted monsters
out power and he was just too small.

345
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:44,990
Chuck was just so scary
back then and he boosted,

346
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:46,280
much wasn't taking chuck down.

347
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:46,701
Well,

348
00:08:46,701 --> 00:08:49,370
boosting Monch had fought
some big fucking dudes though,

349
00:08:49,371 --> 00:08:49,611
man.

350
00:08:49,611 --> 00:08:49,790
Yeah.

351
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,590
That was the thing that he
hadn't taken chucked out.

352
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,840
He had fought some big fucking dude's.

353
00:08:53,841 --> 00:08:58,710
Remember he fought Tom Erickson in
like world combat something or another?

354
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,570
I don't remember the organization.

355
00:09:00,571 --> 00:09:01,980
I do vaguely remember the fight.

356
00:09:01,981 --> 00:09:03,030
I don't remember watching it,

357
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:04,631
but um,

358
00:09:04,631 --> 00:09:04,770
they,

359
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:05,161
it was,

360
00:09:05,161 --> 00:09:05,371
it was,

361
00:09:05,371 --> 00:09:06,204
uh,

362
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,570
it was a mat.

363
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:07,910
I don't,

364
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:11,290
I feel like it was on a mat and
there was no cage or oil ring.

365
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:13,600
Mabee you might be right.

366
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:14,730
Right.

367
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:15,750
That's what my dream is.

368
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,080
My dream is to do a MMA
fights in a football field.

369
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:21,660
I feel like I'm speaking
for football fields.

370
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:21,961
No.

371
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:23,850
So you can't get trapped
up against the cage.

372
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,550
I feel like if a guy takes
you down and holds you down,

373
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,650
he should be able to hold you down
because there's nothing there.

374
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:29,251
But the ground.

375
00:09:29,251 --> 00:09:29,640
Yeah,

376
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,540
but a cage,

377
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:33,750
you can wall walk up the cage there.

378
00:09:33,751 --> 00:09:36,750
You could protect yourself against
submissions up against the cage.

379
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,810
There's a bunch of shit that happens
against the cage that just doesn't happen

380
00:09:39,811 --> 00:09:41,160
if you're in a basketball court.

381
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,860
But then because of that you
got to develop new technique.

382
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,221
Right.

383
00:09:44,221 --> 00:09:46,530
You've got to develop something
to deal with that situation.

384
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:46,950
Yeah.

385
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:47,461
Are you,

386
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:48,294
um,

387
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:49,770
like do you think the rules are okay?

388
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:50,940
No.

389
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:51,241
What do you,

390
00:09:51,241 --> 00:09:52,074
what would you change?

391
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:53,483
I um,

392
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,710
I would definitely change
the 12 to six elbow.

393
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:58,230
That's one I only got the big way.

394
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:59,040
Um,

395
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,030
you know why that one's illegal,

396
00:10:00,031 --> 00:10:00,360
right?

397
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,050
Yeah.

398
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:01,771
So stupid.

399
00:10:01,771 --> 00:10:02,610
I used to watch those,

400
00:10:02,611 --> 00:10:03,444
those um,

401
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:07,110
demonstration used to come on late
at night on ESPN and I was a kid.

402
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:08,430
I used to watch those things all the time.

403
00:10:08,431 --> 00:10:09,210
I used to love him too.

404
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,650
Even when even when I was fighting,

405
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:13,330
I was still watching those
things because it was at a Damon.

406
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:15,880
It,

407
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,030
those things are so silly

408
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,070
though.

409
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:22,261
They,

410
00:10:22,261 --> 00:10:22,621
they get,

411
00:10:22,621 --> 00:10:23,700
they get so intense to,

412
00:10:23,701 --> 00:10:24,534
you know,

413
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:28,150
the athletic commissions really thought
that you couldn't do that to a person

414
00:10:28,151 --> 00:10:28,984
because you'd kill them.

415
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:32,190
So they made that technique
illegal at all this shit.

416
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:36,030
Like we have that power cube thing in
the back where Ghana gone registered that

417
00:10:36,031 --> 00:10:36,864
power punch.

418
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:38,340
If you go all there at elbow,

419
00:10:38,341 --> 00:10:38,821
that thing,

420
00:10:38,821 --> 00:10:41,130
you'd be shocked at how
weak ass her elbows,

421
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:42,990
especially a dropdown elbow.

422
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,090
Like it's just not that much power.

423
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:46,590
It's just,

424
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,120
I mean when they're breaking those boards,

425
00:10:48,121 --> 00:10:49,800
if they're using that,

426
00:10:49,801 --> 00:10:50,880
that joint as a,

427
00:10:50,881 --> 00:10:51,714
as a,

428
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:52,820
as a post as the letter.

429
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:53,311
Exactly.

430
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:55,260
And they're just putting
their body weight behind it.

431
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,191
That's all it is.

432
00:10:56,191 --> 00:10:59,490
You can't necessarily do that when
you're inside someone's guard.

433
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,120
You don't want John Jones
elbow new in the face period.

434
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:03,940
Exactly.

435
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:04,621
No difference.

436
00:11:04,621 --> 00:11:06,420
If John's hitting you
with a downward elbow,

437
00:11:06,421 --> 00:11:10,320
like he got disqualified for when he
fought Matt Hamill or if he's hitting you

438
00:11:10,321 --> 00:11:11,280
with a sideways elbow,

439
00:11:11,281 --> 00:11:12,330
he's going smashing you.

440
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:12,901
You know what,

441
00:11:12,901 --> 00:11:15,120
that download elbow is going
to cut a lot less and less.

442
00:11:15,121 --> 00:11:16,590
It's the point on the top of the head.

443
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,513
That's true.

444
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:18,230
That's true.

445
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:18,650
That's,

446
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,100
that's a very important point.

447
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:21,480
Like that was always the,

448
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,433
um,

449
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:26,220
the argument against no
gloves was that you'd cut,

450
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:27,470
he'd cut people wanting.

451
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,313
Yeah,

452
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,730
I agree with that.

453
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,330
I mean that that skin getting
pinched between bone at that speed,

454
00:11:33,331 --> 00:11:33,570
you know,

455
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:34,710
she's getting torn,

456
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,120
it's not really cut.

457
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:41,420
But do you think that having wrapped
up hands and having padded gloves,

458
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:46,770
like is that an unrealistic sort of thing?

459
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:47,521
Because like if you're,

460
00:11:47,521 --> 00:11:48,354
if you're striking,

461
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,650
if you in a dude,

462
00:11:49,651 --> 00:11:50,484
we're just fighting,

463
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:50,790
right?

464
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:51,480
You're just fighting.

465
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,620
Like there's no like,

466
00:11:52,621 --> 00:11:52,771
hey,

467
00:11:52,771 --> 00:11:54,540
this is a play fight and
we're going to have rules.

468
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,440
This is just a fight you
and a guy are fighting.

469
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:00,340
You can't just hit them with bare hands.

470
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:03,370
The way you can hit them with
gloves on with your wrist taped up,

471
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:03,941
you know,

472
00:12:03,941 --> 00:12:04,091
you,

473
00:12:04,091 --> 00:12:07,480
you gotta be very wary about punching
him full blast and the forehead.

474
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,890
You might shatter your hand.

475
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,450
There's a lot of things
you have to think about.

476
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:11,951
Yeah.

477
00:12:11,951 --> 00:12:16,590
But I guess as as if someone
has done it and trained to,

478
00:12:16,591 --> 00:12:18,130
to try to knock someone out,

479
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:20,500
but you're not thinking about you.

480
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:22,510
We never throwing punches at your skull.

481
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:22,810
Right.

482
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:23,080
You know,

483
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,281
we're,

484
00:12:23,281 --> 00:12:25,770
we're aiming for these targets
that are soft for sure.

485
00:12:25,771 --> 00:12:27,130
So like when you're in a street fight,

486
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,720
like those things don't turn off.

487
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:29,421
So,

488
00:12:29,421 --> 00:12:30,280
so as a fighter,

489
00:12:30,281 --> 00:12:30,520
I,

490
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:30,940
I'm,

491
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:34,360
that's not a concern to me in a street
fight situation when you bring that up.

492
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,560
Um,

493
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,730
but I know it can happen.

494
00:12:36,731 --> 00:12:40,150
I mean it happened in some of the early
UFC guys guys break their hands on

495
00:12:40,151 --> 00:12:40,541
skulls.

496
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:41,374
That's what I'm saying.

497
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,660
Is it unrealistic to put gloves on?

498
00:12:43,661 --> 00:12:46,390
So I'm going to tape the wrist up when
we don't give them any other advantage

499
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:50,260
for striking and any other way you
don't let them cast up your ankles or do

500
00:12:50,261 --> 00:12:51,270
something where you,

501
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:51,491
you know,

502
00:12:51,491 --> 00:12:55,060
your protect your shins and make
it easier for you to kick hard.

503
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:59,230
Cause if you had like some
sort of spandex thing with a,

504
00:12:59,260 --> 00:12:59,770
uh,

505
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:01,210
like a Shin Pad,

506
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,080
like,

507
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,860
like the same sort of thickness of
Shim pad as you have on the knuckles,

508
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,770
you would just be
slamming into everything,

509
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,190
you know,

510
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:10,023
elbows,

511
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:10,511
arms.

512
00:13:10,511 --> 00:13:11,291
Who gives a fuck?

513
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,220
You wouldn't worry about it.

514
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,480
Just slamming in there.

515
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,020
Boom.

516
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:14,853
It would change the game.

517
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,750
A W W it would completely change the game,

518
00:13:16,751 --> 00:13:17,061
but it would,

519
00:13:17,061 --> 00:13:19,150
it would slow it down a lot more.

520
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:19,780
I mean,

521
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:23,320
in MMA fights now that you look at a
punched out for him and may five versus a

522
00:13:23,321 --> 00:13:24,160
boxing match,

523
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:24,610
you know,

524
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:26,020
of course they can only punch so,

525
00:13:26,021 --> 00:13:30,100
so the punch counts higher but
your hands are getting hurt.

526
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:31,120
You know,

527
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:31,421
guys,

528
00:13:31,421 --> 00:13:34,840
guys will lose fights simply because
they can't continue going into the second

529
00:13:34,841 --> 00:13:35,530
round sometimes.

530
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:37,840
Will that be the case or
will it change their style?

531
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:40,330
It will definitely change the style,

532
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:44,050
but without having the gloves and
hand wraps and that stuff there,

533
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,020
there is going to be those
times when it's still going to,

534
00:13:47,021 --> 00:13:47,910
it's just going to minimize,

535
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,810
not minimize but bring the number down.

536
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:51,490
It's not going to stop it though.

537
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:52,630
I agree.

538
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:53,560
Um,

539
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:57,430
I mean I think if I wanted to look at
it in terms of just pure entertainment

540
00:13:57,431 --> 00:13:58,180
value,

541
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,350
I'd say leave it the way it is.

542
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:00,190
Yeah,

543
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:00,820
absolutely.

544
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,500
Changed downward elbows.

545
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:03,940
Checked out a couple of other things.

546
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:04,471
Yes.

547
00:14:04,471 --> 00:14:04,691
Some,

548
00:14:04,691 --> 00:14:06,460
some things like I liked pride rules.

549
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:07,510
Yeah.

550
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:08,650
So bad rules,

551
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,420
including with the judging.

552
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:10,831
The pride.

553
00:14:10,831 --> 00:14:11,231
It was judge,

554
00:14:11,231 --> 00:14:12,550
the whole fight drives the whole fight.

555
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:13,443
I agree with that.

556
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:14,050
I like that.

557
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:14,883
I agree with that.

558
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,740
And I think I'm more judges,

559
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,371
you know.

560
00:14:18,371 --> 00:14:19,204
Um,

561
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:22,560
but I think that's a big one I was
talking about with that with Pat Miletich

562
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:24,490
show the day were saying
like five judges are more,

563
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:25,780
you know,

564
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,613
why only three?

565
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:27,160
Yeah,

566
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:27,720
I agree.

567
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,610
And I agree with more judges that
you will get a little more diversity.

568
00:14:30,611 --> 00:14:32,050
Also though I think,

569
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:32,913
um,

570
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,330
you got to change,

571
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,670
change the scoring criteria.

572
00:14:36,671 --> 00:14:38,530
I mean we are using a boxing criteria,

573
00:14:38,531 --> 00:14:39,150
but like,

574
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:41,560
like when you talk about
wrestling and when I see guys go,

575
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:41,891
oh,

576
00:14:41,891 --> 00:14:42,701
he's going to take that.

577
00:14:42,701 --> 00:14:43,390
When a guy goes down,

578
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:44,260
he pops right back up.

579
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:44,561
I'm like,

580
00:14:44,561 --> 00:14:45,341
this is not a take down.

581
00:14:45,341 --> 00:14:47,330
It's not too so,

582
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,710
so like why can't we
implement some of the things,

583
00:14:50,711 --> 00:14:53,390
because we're taking aspects of all
these different styles of fighting,

584
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:54,360
like the,

585
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,900
the scoring system and the
values for things should,

586
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,570
should come from that to some degree.

587
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:00,081
Yeah.

588
00:15:00,081 --> 00:15:02,160
I would take down with
the immediate standup.

589
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:02,331
Like,

590
00:15:02,331 --> 00:15:03,111
if someone takes you down,

591
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:03,944
you're right back up.

592
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,740
That is not a whole lot different
than you blocking the kick.

593
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:07,250
Yeah.

594
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:07,540
You know,

595
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:10,640
does blocking a kick count if you get
your knee up and your elbow up and you

596
00:15:10,641 --> 00:15:11,690
catch one right here,

597
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,300
are you counting that as
something that got through right?

598
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:14,630
No,

599
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:15,463
no you're not.

600
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:16,740
So you know who does right?

601
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:17,340
Jackson,

602
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:20,180
he's a great coach and I don't say he.

603
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:21,260
So he,

604
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,910
I think he does this psychological thing.

605
00:15:22,911 --> 00:15:24,210
I'm letting the cat out of the bag,

606
00:15:24,211 --> 00:15:25,044
but this way,

607
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:26,340
cause I'm in the cage with,

608
00:15:26,341 --> 00:15:30,700
with Isaac Valley flag and Isaac throws
a kick and I block it and Greg is like,

609
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:31,540
it's a great kick.

610
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,630
Isaac Greg Kick like that landed me,

611
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:34,011
you know,

612
00:15:34,011 --> 00:15:34,790
and I'm like,

613
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:36,980
and then he does something
else and it doesn't affect me,

614
00:15:36,981 --> 00:15:38,630
but he's cheering him on like it does.

615
00:15:38,631 --> 00:15:39,290
And I'm like,

616
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:40,490
is he doing that for the rat,

617
00:15:40,491 --> 00:15:41,330
for the judges?

618
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:42,980
Cause that I'm like,

619
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:44,150
I went back to the corner,

620
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:44,721
I told Mike,

621
00:15:44,721 --> 00:15:45,051
I was like,

622
00:15:45,051 --> 00:15:45,351
Mike,

623
00:15:45,351 --> 00:15:45,691
he's,

624
00:15:45,691 --> 00:15:48,320
he's cheering them on and getting kind
of getting the judges on his side.

625
00:15:48,321 --> 00:15:48,651
Mike's like,

626
00:15:48,651 --> 00:15:49,461
don't worry about that.

627
00:15:49,461 --> 00:15:50,300
This is what you need to do.

628
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:50,660
Yeah.

629
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:52,100
You gotta get that shit out of your head.

630
00:15:52,101 --> 00:15:52,341
Yeah,

631
00:15:52,341 --> 00:15:53,030
for sure.

632
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:53,571
For sure.

633
00:15:53,571 --> 00:15:55,350
But if he's right there,

634
00:15:55,351 --> 00:15:59,210
it'll give you see where one corner is
and then the other corner is when the

635
00:15:59,211 --> 00:16:00,740
fight is not going on there,

636
00:16:00,741 --> 00:16:02,150
over there by the stairs.

637
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:03,590
The judge is right there.

638
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,250
Yup.

639
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:07,130
The judges just a few feet over and
if they're looking enthusiastic,

640
00:16:07,131 --> 00:16:07,281
like,

641
00:16:07,281 --> 00:16:07,731
yes,

642
00:16:07,731 --> 00:16:08,181
you gotta,

643
00:16:08,181 --> 00:16:08,601
you gotta,

644
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:11,300
you gotta those judges a certain percent,

645
00:16:11,301 --> 00:16:15,730
let's say 30 don't know what the fuck
they're watching and so they're very soon

646
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,460
we say a name.

647
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:16,641
No,

648
00:16:16,641 --> 00:16:16,860
I'm just,

649
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:16,970
no,

650
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:19,520
let's not say any names
because I know what we'd say.

651
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,230
We'd all say the same name,

652
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:22,064
unfortunately.

653
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,210
Nice Lady.

654
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:24,043
Anyway,

655
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,033
this,

656
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:30,200
this fucking situation is there
should be way better judges for sure.

657
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:30,740
Yeah.

658
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,140
I think guys who were former fighters,

659
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,000
guys who are martial arts experts,

660
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:37,340
guys who like really care about the sport,

661
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,320
you have no shortage of them.

662
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:40,940
You can go to any MMA school,

663
00:16:40,941 --> 00:16:42,050
any Jujitsu school,

664
00:16:42,051 --> 00:16:43,220
Eddie kickboxing school,

665
00:16:43,221 --> 00:16:44,054
any websites,

666
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:46,250
any website all across the country.

667
00:16:46,251 --> 00:16:49,220
And you will find hundreds and
hundreds of qualified candidates.

668
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:52,010
People that will tell you
why that's a bad decision.

669
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,170
People that'll tell you
why that doesn't work.

670
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:56,420
People will tell you why
this shouldn't mean anything.

671
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:59,390
And we don't have that
right now for no reason.

672
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:00,860
There's like zero reason.

673
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:02,120
It doesn't make any sense.

674
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:02,961
It's not like,

675
00:17:02,961 --> 00:17:03,400
wow man,

676
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,233
there's not enough money.

677
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,590
Like what is this?

678
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:05,991
No,

679
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:07,190
there's enough money for it.

680
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,300
This is this crazy.

681
00:17:08,301 --> 00:17:09,500
This is no reason.

682
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:10,191
It's not like,

683
00:17:10,191 --> 00:17:10,431
well,

684
00:17:10,431 --> 00:17:10,671
you know,

685
00:17:10,671 --> 00:17:12,440
water's wet and that's just how it goes.

686
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:13,290
No,

687
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:13,760
that would be,

688
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,110
I think it would be a good thing also
now that like the second generation I,

689
00:17:18,111 --> 00:17:19,220
I have like in my head,

690
00:17:19,221 --> 00:17:22,970
I have this three generations of them
may and that's where we are now in the

691
00:17:22,971 --> 00:17:24,740
third starting to move into the fourth.

692
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,090
Um,

693
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:29,540
and I feel like with the first two
generations being done pretty much.

694
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:29,990
Yeah.

695
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:33,140
Like there's a lot of guys
that are highly qualified to,

696
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,790
to play more,

697
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:35,420
you know,

698
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:38,450
then it may mean the sport is giant.

699
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,970
There's so many good writers out there.

700
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,800
If you read MMA articles,

701
00:17:42,801 --> 00:17:47,801
they're really good writing and a lot of
these like mainstream websites SLAAC a

702
00:17:47,881 --> 00:17:50,340
lot of experts out there talking

703
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:50,790
about stuff.

704
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:55,790
That's why a fight like next weekend is
so fascinating because between Tony and

705
00:17:56,731 --> 00:17:57,270
could be,

706
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:59,580
nobody knows what the
fuck is going to happen.

707
00:17:59,581 --> 00:18:01,200
It's one of those fights
where everybody's like,

708
00:18:01,201 --> 00:18:01,711
damn,

709
00:18:01,711 --> 00:18:02,340
I don't know.

710
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:05,070
And you got all these people breaking
it down on one side and then you've got

711
00:18:05,071 --> 00:18:07,380
people making compelling arguments
on the other side and you're like,

712
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,413
okay,

713
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,280
this one's going to be weird.

714
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:12,061
I've been,

715
00:18:12,061 --> 00:18:14,820
I've been bouncing back and forth
between my pick for that fight.

716
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:15,590
But,

717
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:16,423
um,

718
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,920
I guess because I've been
bouncing back and forth,

719
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:21,740
this isn't necessarily
where I'm going to stay,

720
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,041
but I,

721
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:23,510
I feel like,

722
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:24,141
okay,

723
00:18:24,141 --> 00:18:25,370
I don't see how that can change.

724
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:25,851
But again,

725
00:18:25,851 --> 00:18:26,391
like you said,

726
00:18:26,391 --> 00:18:30,260
there are people that are making these
arguments and if somebody convinces me of

727
00:18:30,261 --> 00:18:32,840
something that kinda
defeats this argument,

728
00:18:32,841 --> 00:18:33,381
then it's like,

729
00:18:33,381 --> 00:18:33,771
man,

730
00:18:33,771 --> 00:18:35,420
now you opened the door for this again.

731
00:18:35,421 --> 00:18:36,890
And what I think is like what I first,

732
00:18:36,891 --> 00:18:38,720
my first thought was could be,

733
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:39,291
he was this guy,

734
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:42,980
he takes everybody down and he controls
you and beat you up and you think he's

735
00:18:42,981 --> 00:18:43,610
going to do that.

736
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:44,240
And then,

737
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:44,840
um,

738
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,860
but Tony is this guy,

739
00:18:45,861 --> 00:18:46,970
he just does not,

740
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:49,310
he's like one of these
submission first kind of guys.

741
00:18:49,311 --> 00:18:49,600
You know,

742
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,221
where that argument,

743
00:18:50,221 --> 00:18:52,820
submission or position told him he wasn't
even too worried about the position.

744
00:18:52,821 --> 00:18:53,750
He'll create scrambles.

745
00:18:53,751 --> 00:18:54,200
He's,

746
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,840
he's aware of where he is at all
times and what he's giving up.

747
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:00,380
So I feel like he would
just continue to scramble.

748
00:19:00,381 --> 00:19:02,090
He'd be able to get back
to his feet at least.

749
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:03,283
Um,

750
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:07,670
and then I go back to Khabib and seeing
Tony Against Kevin Lee and Kevin Lee

751
00:19:07,671 --> 00:19:09,260
kind of control him early in that fight.

752
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:09,951
You know,

753
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,720
he was able to pass his guard and do some,

754
00:19:11,721 --> 00:19:13,250
some good controlling things.

755
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:13,940
Now.

756
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:14,810
If a guy like could be,

757
00:19:14,811 --> 00:19:15,644
you can do that.

758
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:18,150
Right then he's not getting
back up and could be,

759
00:19:18,151 --> 00:19:19,850
he was going to be able to take him down.

760
00:19:19,851 --> 00:19:21,890
He is the best wrestler in the game.

761
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:22,860
Like without a doubt.

762
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:23,823
Yeah.

763
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,880
Make good arguments.

764
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:25,893
Good arguments.

765
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:26,291
You know,

766
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:27,850
I think another argument is it Kevin,

767
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,560
when Kevin Lee fought Tony,

768
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,870
I think everybody knew
Kevin had a staph infection.

769
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:34,300
I knew I saw him walking to the cage.

770
00:19:34,301 --> 00:19:35,134
I look at his chest.

771
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:35,591
I was like,

772
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:36,190
Holy Shit,

773
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:37,150
that guy's got staff.

774
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:38,710
I knew it was going to be weak.

775
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:41,340
I knew in compared to the Kevin Lee,

776
00:19:41,341 --> 00:19:44,080
the destroyer that you see when
he's on point and in shape,

777
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:44,711
I was like,

778
00:19:44,711 --> 00:19:46,070
this guy is going to be compromised.

779
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:46,300
Yeah,

780
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:50,530
and he's also a big one 55
so it's a hard cut for him.

781
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:53,440
Whereas Tony makes it mean
Tony can get pretty heavy,

782
00:19:53,441 --> 00:19:54,580
but he's super disciplined.

783
00:19:54,581 --> 00:19:55,414
He makes it easy.

784
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,710
Tony's endurance,

785
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:58,420
his endurance is off the charts,

786
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,130
off the charts impeccable.

787
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,050
He was posting the other
day that he went on a six,

788
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,910
six mile run at one
o'clock in the morning.

789
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,080
It's like extra credit.

790
00:20:05,081 --> 00:20:06,490
He wrote Hashtag extra credit.

791
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,050
I mean he's an animal.

792
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:10,630
I mean Eddie Bravo trains of them
up there in big bear all the time.

793
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:12,760
[inaudible] he said he's
never seen anything like it.

794
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:16,780
So to do is just everybody else like pace
and everybody up the hill coming back

795
00:20:16,781 --> 00:20:17,081
down.

796
00:20:17,081 --> 00:20:19,060
They're still trying to make it up
the first time he's running past them.

797
00:20:19,061 --> 00:20:21,040
The second time he's a fucking animal.

798
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,290
Like aw,

799
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,230
he wants it bad.

800
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:26,980
But so he knew that Kevin goes
into that fight was compromised.

801
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:28,600
So if he knew Kevin was compromised,

802
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,300
maybe he decided just to let them work.

803
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,470
Let them work that first round.

804
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:32,910
Yeah.

805
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:34,510
And Kevin's don't know joke.

806
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:35,890
Kevin's fucking dangerous.

807
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:36,903
Very skilled.

808
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:37,893
Very skilled,

809
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:38,831
very aggressive.

810
00:20:38,831 --> 00:20:39,790
Very strong.

811
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:40,780
Very dangerous.

812
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:41,261
You know.

813
00:20:41,261 --> 00:20:42,094
So Tony,

814
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:44,140
he got in bad positions
in that fight though,

815
00:20:44,141 --> 00:20:44,960
didn't he get mounted?

816
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,900
He gets routed.

817
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,990
He is guy got pretty convinced,

818
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,800
like pretty easily early in the fight.

819
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:52,323
Um,

820
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:53,470
but that's crazy because if,

821
00:20:53,471 --> 00:20:53,950
if he,

822
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:55,360
if he did take that time off,

823
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:57,520
even knowing that a
guy like Kevin Lee was,

824
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:58,180
you know,

825
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,013
compromised,

826
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:02,860
that's still a high level guy to be,

827
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:03,610
um,

828
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:04,690
take this time off.

829
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,460
It'll be a little bit laxed.

830
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,130
Might just have been Kevin.

831
00:21:09,131 --> 00:21:09,964
Is that good?

832
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:12,580
I really wish that fight took
place with Kevin Healthy.

833
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,530
Really wish that fight
took place with Kit Kat.

834
00:21:14,531 --> 00:21:16,900
I said Kevin is an
interesting guy because he's,

835
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,220
he talks a lot of shit.

836
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:18,490
Yeah.

837
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:19,990
He's really aggressive.

838
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:21,490
He fights well.

839
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,450
He looks the part,

840
00:21:22,451 --> 00:21:22,961
when you look at him,

841
00:21:22,961 --> 00:21:24,130
he's fucking jacked.

842
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,233
You know,

843
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:27,520
that's a bad break for a dude like that.

844
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:30,460
He had like a golf ball
growing out of his tit.

845
00:21:30,461 --> 00:21:31,090
Yeah.

846
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:31,930
That was crazy.

847
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:32,471
I mean,

848
00:21:32,471 --> 00:21:35,440
it could happen again relatively soon
depending on how it was fight with with

849
00:21:35,441 --> 00:21:36,280
Barboza goes.

850
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:36,910
Yeah,

851
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:37,510
yeah,

852
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:38,343
yeah.

853
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:40,670
That's an interesting
fight for Barboza tube are,

854
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:41,800
has got to recover from that.

855
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:44,740
Mauling the can you put on
them that was horrendous.

856
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:45,970
But you know,

857
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:47,500
I'm an opponent to Tony.

858
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:48,400
Yeah,

859
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,001
exactly.

860
00:21:49,001 --> 00:21:50,770
And I want to look back at,

861
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:51,520
um,

862
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,540
the Barbosa fight.

863
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:53,261
But when I,

864
00:21:53,261 --> 00:21:54,340
when I did look at it,

865
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:55,960
he defended,

866
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,060
he defended some of those takedowns early,

867
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:58,961
you know what I mean?

868
00:21:58,961 --> 00:21:59,441
It's against,

869
00:21:59,441 --> 00:21:59,921
could be eve now.

870
00:21:59,921 --> 00:22:00,461
Yes.

871
00:22:00,461 --> 00:22:01,031
You can defend,

872
00:22:01,031 --> 00:22:02,950
you're going to be the
strongest in the first round,

873
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,150
but still,

874
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:05,050
um,

875
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:06,510
there's not a lot of people defending,

876
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:07,580
could be his takedowns.

877
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:07,870
No.

878
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:08,470
You know,

879
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:09,140
um,

880
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:11,890
there's a great New York Times
article that was us just on,

881
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,510
um,

882
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:16,330
or three or four days ago
about wrestlers from Dagestan.

883
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:16,810
Yeah.

884
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:21,810
And about how wrestling is their way out
because so many of them trying to prove

885
00:22:22,211 --> 00:22:23,020
themselves,

886
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:26,800
they wind up joining those
Islamic terrorist groups and,

887
00:22:26,801 --> 00:22:26,970
uh,

888
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:29,980
that these coaches try
to take these young,

889
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,730
aggressive kids and give them something,

890
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:33,600
something,

891
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,740
something else and give
them another alternative,

892
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:36,701
really,

893
00:22:36,701 --> 00:22:38,650
really well written article.

894
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:43,680
Interesting stuff about like how powerful
these guys are and how young they get

895
00:22:43,871 --> 00:22:44,704
him into it.

896
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,830
And when you see Khabib,

897
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,380
the thing about him,

898
00:22:47,381 --> 00:22:50,350
it's like he's not doing different
things and everybody else,

899
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,243
you know what I mean?

900
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:55,870
Like some people are doing different
things like wonder boy is doing different

901
00:22:55,871 --> 00:22:56,201
things.

902
00:22:56,201 --> 00:22:57,880
Like he stands totally sideways,

903
00:22:57,881 --> 00:22:58,870
his hands are down.

904
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:00,640
He's throwing front leg sidekicks.

905
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:00,821
Yeah,

906
00:23:00,821 --> 00:23:02,290
he's doing a lot of different
things and you're like,

907
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:02,711
oh,

908
00:23:02,711 --> 00:23:02,891
okay,

909
00:23:02,891 --> 00:23:03,311
this is some,

910
00:23:03,311 --> 00:23:04,680
a new thing to adjust to.

911
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,510
It could be labs doing standard shit,

912
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:12,810
but he's just doing it at not just our
notch but several notches past what

913
00:23:14,201 --> 00:23:15,160
everybody else is doing.

914
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:17,650
I think that's the thing
about these Dagestani guys.

915
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:18,370
Um,

916
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:19,720
it's crazy because like,

917
00:23:19,721 --> 00:23:21,220
it's this American wrestling style,

918
00:23:21,221 --> 00:23:23,860
folk style wrestling of being
on top and having that control.

919
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:24,970
That's a big deal.

920
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,140
But like Nick Lens,

921
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:27,310
that's one of his strengths.

922
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,050
When nick gets on top of you,

923
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:29,870
it's like a,

924
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:30,870
a Dorf,

925
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:31,320
you know,

926
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,560
like he's not going anywhere,

927
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:35,080
but he can also escape that.

928
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:35,561
A lot of guys,

929
00:23:35,561 --> 00:23:36,550
same thing with Mike Brown,

930
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,680
but um,

931
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:40,220
Nick Lance got written out at the w in,

932
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,260
in the fight in Brooklyn.

933
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:46,200
I forget which car that I'm Holly
Holmes and Jermaine Mandarin to me.

934
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:48,350
You know that car he
wanted by getting right?

935
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:49,170
No,

936
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:50,750
the ones launch one which fight,

937
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:51,741
I forget who,

938
00:23:51,741 --> 00:23:52,551
who he fought,

939
00:23:52,551 --> 00:23:54,050
I forget he fought a Dagestani guy.

940
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:54,711
Oh.

941
00:23:54,711 --> 00:23:57,440
But he just got written
out against his own style.

942
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:58,610
Like that's what I'm saying.

943
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:02,000
These guys are better at what they
are with the American style is.

944
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,130
But like for something like that,

945
00:24:04,131 --> 00:24:07,090
I want to see one of those guys
against a guy like Greg Gillespie,

946
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:07,940
you know,

947
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:11,000
cause that style of wrestling of
being on top and grinding on you.

948
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:16,220
That's a high like a high level wrestler
like that and no fault out four time.

949
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:19,730
All American national champion kind of
guy with that kind of conditioning who's

950
00:24:19,731 --> 00:24:20,564
not going to break.

951
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:22,400
I want to see that battle.

952
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,060
That's like,

953
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:27,080
cause that'll be like a a Nash National
Championship with two guys that can

954
00:24:27,081 --> 00:24:27,950
punch and kick a bit.

955
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:31,370
Well look at guy like Jordan Burroughs
or Jordan Burroughs getting into mmn.

956
00:24:31,371 --> 00:24:31,700
Yeah.

957
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:34,360
Like what happens when he fights
when those Dagestani guys.

958
00:24:34,361 --> 00:24:34,820
Yeah,

959
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:35,510
exactly.

960
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:38,360
But see there's Dagestani
guys and then it's could beep.

961
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:40,910
He's another notch above them.

962
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:42,620
He's a notch above them.

963
00:24:42,621 --> 00:24:42,771
Like,

964
00:24:42,771 --> 00:24:44,570
there's a lot of those
guys that are real good.

965
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,590
They're real tough,

966
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:46,483
you know,

967
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,990
but he's another level.

968
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:51,350
He is a scary level when
you see him on top of guys,

969
00:24:51,351 --> 00:24:51,621
like,

970
00:24:51,621 --> 00:24:53,150
like especially the Michael Johnson,

971
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:54,800
that was helpless.

972
00:24:54,801 --> 00:24:56,300
That was mauling man,

973
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:57,320
horrifying.

974
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,090
And having a conversation with him,

975
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,100
pleading with him to give up,

976
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,810
you must quit title shut this mind,

977
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:03,761
you know,

978
00:25:03,761 --> 00:25:05,090
title shot they deserve.

979
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,280
Bam just keeps,

980
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,290
and he's got his arm tied behind his
back is punching him in the face.

981
00:25:09,291 --> 00:25:10,124
It's horrific.

982
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,150
It's horrific.

983
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:12,051
I mean,

984
00:25:12,051 --> 00:25:13,730
he can do shit to you that like,

985
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,230
it's like white belt,

986
00:25:15,231 --> 00:25:16,270
black belt beat up.

987
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:19,640
It's against the best guy in the world
against the best guys in the world.

988
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:20,893
Michael Johnson.

989
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,250
Michael Johnson clipped him.

990
00:25:22,251 --> 00:25:22,730
No,

991
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:23,890
but here's the thing about that fight.

992
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:24,783
It's interesting to me.

993
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,620
It could be came into that
fight with the same problem.

994
00:25:27,621 --> 00:25:29,630
He went into the Tony Ferguson
fight that was canceled.

995
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:34,280
He cut too much weight and his liver
apparently shutdown making wait for that

996
00:25:34,281 --> 00:25:35,114
fight.

997
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:37,070
So then they went into the next fight.

998
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,120
Um,

999
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,140
and he didn't make weight at all.

1000
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:40,460
Rushed to the hospital.

1001
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:42,170
Then he hired a nutritionist.

1002
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:43,730
Looks fucking fantastic.

1003
00:25:43,731 --> 00:25:47,030
Event Against Barboza has zero problems
making weight and now he's got it all

1004
00:25:47,031 --> 00:25:47,864
under control.

1005
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:51,650
But you got to wonder if he was
compromised in the Michael Johnson fight.

1006
00:25:51,651 --> 00:25:55,100
How much of a factor did that
play into the him getting stunned.

1007
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:55,381
Yeah,

1008
00:25:55,381 --> 00:25:55,670
he got,

1009
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:56,503
he got clipped,

1010
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:57,453
he got clipped.

1011
00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:01,350
And you know as well as anybody that
when you're dehydrated or you have been

1012
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:01,661
dehydrated,

1013
00:26:01,661 --> 00:26:02,810
you just don't take a punch as well.

1014
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,260
Yeah,

1015
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,093
yeah.

1016
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:04,970
Dehydration,

1017
00:26:04,971 --> 00:26:05,804
conditioning,

1018
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,621
those things.

1019
00:26:06,621 --> 00:26:07,011
You know,

1020
00:26:07,011 --> 00:26:08,780
those things help you recover when you,

1021
00:26:08,781 --> 00:26:10,430
when you're hydrated and
you're conditioning is,

1022
00:26:10,431 --> 00:26:11,264
is up to.

1023
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:12,463
Um,

1024
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:12,771
yeah.

1025
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:13,604
I don't know.

1026
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,001
He,

1027
00:26:14,001 --> 00:26:15,170
you seen him take some punches.

1028
00:26:15,171 --> 00:26:16,490
He always backs guys up.

1029
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:20,150
He's always coming forward and he does
eat a lot of shots coming forward.

1030
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:21,650
But you know,

1031
00:26:21,651 --> 00:26:24,530
if his conditioning is fine and that's
the only time that I can remember him

1032
00:26:24,531 --> 00:26:26,930
getting hurt in a fight
and from taking shots,

1033
00:26:26,931 --> 00:26:28,040
like the same thing with Barbosa,

1034
00:26:28,041 --> 00:26:28,381
Barbosa,

1035
00:26:28,381 --> 00:26:29,420
who was thrown at him hard,

1036
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:29,931
hard,

1037
00:26:29,931 --> 00:26:30,171
you know,

1038
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:31,004
especially,

1039
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:31,650
yeah,

1040
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:32,120
just stuff.

1041
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:32,590
Everything.

1042
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:33,423
He's like a Zombie.

1043
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,940
He got wheel kicked a couple of times.

1044
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,610
It's not the club in the back
of the head would wheel kicks.

1045
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:37,940
Nope.

1046
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:38,690
Sorry.

1047
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:39,523
Not Today.

1048
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:43,220
Just constantly charging forward.

1049
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:44,100
He's

1050
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,030
a fucking tank.

1051
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,140
Terrifying guy.

1052
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:47,670
But this is the fight.

1053
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,530
To me that's the most intriguing.

1054
00:26:49,531 --> 00:26:50,850
Other than him fighting Conor,

1055
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:52,590
him fighting Conor for the name value.

1056
00:26:52,591 --> 00:26:53,520
It's like chaos,

1057
00:26:53,521 --> 00:26:53,790
right?

1058
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:54,720
Like Holy Shit.

1059
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:55,830
Like they might do that.

1060
00:26:55,831 --> 00:26:56,630
If he wins,

1061
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:57,211
he might do that.

1062
00:26:57,211 --> 00:26:57,930
Do that Russia,

1063
00:26:57,930 --> 00:26:58,561
dude,

1064
00:26:58,561 --> 00:26:59,130
if they do that,

1065
00:26:59,130 --> 00:26:59,491
Russia,

1066
00:26:59,491 --> 00:27:00,780
Connor better bring his own food.

1067
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,190
I tell you that.

1068
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:03,420
Hey,

1069
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,710
better bring some fucking corn,

1070
00:27:04,711 --> 00:27:06,480
beef and cabbage right
from the motherland.

1071
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,210
You don't want to take any chances.

1072
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:12,220
But when Khabib,

1073
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:13,680
um,

1074
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,330
when Khabib's fighting Tony,

1075
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,420
the thing about Tony is
that Tony so creative,

1076
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,220
like he's very unpredictable.

1077
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,460
You don't know what he might step
in and throw an upward elbow.

1078
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:23,920
You know,

1079
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,160
he,

1080
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:24,401
he,

1081
00:27:24,401 --> 00:27:25,740
he'll do all kinds of weird shit.

1082
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,150
He'll do Granby rolls on you.

1083
00:27:27,151 --> 00:27:28,410
He'll die for a leg.

1084
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:28,860
You know,

1085
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,510
he might try to take Khabib down.

1086
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:32,520
Who knows what he's
going to do and stand up.

1087
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:34,500
He's got legit knockout power,

1088
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:35,250
legit.

1089
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:36,480
And he can take a shot.

1090
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:38,080
Rolls with punches real well,

1091
00:27:38,081 --> 00:27:38,851
doesn't mind.

1092
00:27:38,851 --> 00:27:39,870
When he gets hit hard,

1093
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,370
he just kind of rolls with Shit,

1094
00:27:41,371 --> 00:27:43,440
comes back like the Barboza fight.

1095
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:46,290
The Barboza fight with him
was a very interesting fight.

1096
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,010
Yeah.

1097
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:47,371
That,

1098
00:27:47,371 --> 00:27:48,840
that fight was fun to watch.

1099
00:27:48,841 --> 00:27:49,471
Like I can't,

1100
00:27:49,471 --> 00:27:51,480
I can't remember all
the details right now,

1101
00:27:51,481 --> 00:27:52,530
but I remember thinking,

1102
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,520
I remember tweeting,

1103
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,271
man,

1104
00:27:54,271 --> 00:27:56,190
I'm watching this and
these guys are savages.

1105
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:56,620
I,

1106
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:57,300
I can't,

1107
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:01,230
I can't believe I thought one of
these days I have bad daddy can steal.

1108
00:28:01,231 --> 00:28:01,890
It's like,

1109
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:02,131
man,

1110
00:28:02,131 --> 00:28:02,964
I fought them both.

1111
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:06,901
But yeah,

1112
00:28:06,901 --> 00:28:07,191
that,

1113
00:28:07,191 --> 00:28:08,550
that fight was fun to watch.

1114
00:28:08,551 --> 00:28:08,911
And that's,

1115
00:28:08,911 --> 00:28:11,760
that's that common opponent
thing that you say and yeah.

1116
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:12,650
I don't know.

1117
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:14,370
It's one of those things also though,

1118
00:28:14,371 --> 00:28:16,950
because you know the rule fighter ABC,

1119
00:28:16,951 --> 00:28:19,080
that thing doesn't play
out like stout beats,

1120
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,060
like stat Jeremy Stevens beats down.

1121
00:28:21,061 --> 00:28:22,920
I'd beat Jeremy and Jeremy.

1122
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:23,791
That would be,

1123
00:28:23,791 --> 00:28:24,181
to me,

1124
00:28:24,181 --> 00:28:25,410
it's this crazy,

1125
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,660
crazy thing where it just doesn't add up.

1126
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,553
It doesn't add up.

1127
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,011
MMA.

1128
00:28:29,011 --> 00:28:30,180
Math just doesn't work.

1129
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:34,920
It's one of the reasons why someone
like a could be so impressive.

1130
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:36,270
It's cause he beats everybody.

1131
00:28:36,271 --> 00:28:37,620
Everyone undefeated.

1132
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:37,950
Yeah.

1133
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,770
Who the fuck is undefeated at that level?

1134
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:40,380
The game,

1135
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:45,380
I think he has 25 victories is f five
and 25 at Oh him and that's the other

1136
00:28:45,781 --> 00:28:47,520
thing like I still called John Jay.

1137
00:28:47,521 --> 00:28:50,160
I called him one defeated
because Jon Jones,

1138
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:52,400
he's undefeated in my book cause nonsense.

1139
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:54,190
You know when when you get smashed.

1140
00:28:54,191 --> 00:28:54,750
Exactly.

1141
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:55,950
He dominated that fight.

1142
00:28:55,951 --> 00:28:57,860
100% was a,

1143
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:01,440
it's a goofy rule and I don't even
know if he totally violated it.

1144
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:05,670
I mean he's trying to get through the
guard while he's finishing a guy guys

1145
00:29:05,671 --> 00:29:07,860
covering up stupid.

1146
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,211
It makes me mad.

1147
00:29:09,211 --> 00:29:10,110
I feel like it hit a nerve.

1148
00:29:10,111 --> 00:29:12,080
It that one time at the 12 to six help.

1149
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:15,330
It makes me mad because it makes me mad
because it's still there because they

1150
00:29:15,331 --> 00:29:18,420
changed the rules like they went
through this new unified rule system.

1151
00:29:18,421 --> 00:29:18,780
I'm like,

1152
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:19,613
oh this is good.

1153
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:23,490
We have some new regulations as far as
like putting your hand on the mat and

1154
00:29:23,491 --> 00:29:23,970
getting,

1155
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,020
taking a knee,

1156
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:25,701
you know like when,

1157
00:29:25,701 --> 00:29:26,740
when can you hit a guy with a knee?

1158
00:29:26,741 --> 00:29:28,080
Now it's one hand,

1159
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,160
now you can do it with one hand.

1160
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:29,910
Great.

1161
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:30,743
I like that.

1162
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:32,130
What Donna's 12,

1163
00:29:32,131 --> 00:29:34,740
six elbows still in c,

1164
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:35,520
here's,

1165
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,250
here's what I've learned
since I've retired,

1166
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:40,980
is that all of these
formulas fit into something.

1167
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:42,160
So right now

1168
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:42,820
you're like,

1169
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,020
well you change this one thing,

1170
00:29:44,021 --> 00:29:45,520
will all this other shit is wrong?

1171
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,001
Well,

1172
00:29:46,001 --> 00:29:47,980
you look at society and
you look at the world,

1173
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:48,670
right?

1174
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:51,490
And like these little
changes or what happens,

1175
00:29:51,491 --> 00:29:52,324
it's never,

1176
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:55,060
everything that's wrong
is in fixed at all times.

1177
00:29:55,061 --> 00:29:57,040
It's always as one little things fixed.

1178
00:29:57,041 --> 00:29:58,230
This other little things fixed.

1179
00:29:58,231 --> 00:29:59,064
There's a little things,

1180
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:00,183
you know what I mean?

1181
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:01,870
So it's gonna take a while.

1182
00:30:01,871 --> 00:30:03,010
It'll happen eventually.

1183
00:30:03,011 --> 00:30:03,880
But man,

1184
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,200
there is so much in the,

1185
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:07,570
like there should be something
that changes every year.

1186
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:08,200
Yeah,

1187
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:08,860
I agree.

1188
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:09,490
I think they,

1189
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:11,500
they've got to figure out
something with the I pokes.

1190
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:12,933
Yeah.

1191
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,210
I feel like there's,

1192
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:17,351
I think some,

1193
00:30:17,351 --> 00:30:17,670
I dunno,

1194
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:18,371
he might have been you.

1195
00:30:18,371 --> 00:30:18,701
I feel,

1196
00:30:18,701 --> 00:30:19,031
cause it was,

1197
00:30:19,031 --> 00:30:19,321
it was,

1198
00:30:19,321 --> 00:30:19,600
uh,

1199
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,760
an announcer or a commentator
or something talking about it,

1200
00:30:21,761 --> 00:30:22,600
but having like a,

1201
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:25,240
a glove just to covers the fingers,

1202
00:30:25,241 --> 00:30:26,710
but it doesn't really change anything.

1203
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:27,130
Even,

1204
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:32,020
even so much so that like it's a
webbing and that your fingers are still

1205
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:33,340
virtually individual,

1206
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,091
you know,

1207
00:30:34,091 --> 00:30:37,120
but you can bring them all down together
or you can just put those two on and

1208
00:30:37,121 --> 00:30:38,440
these two are going to be tugged that,

1209
00:30:38,441 --> 00:30:39,520
but it takes no effort.

1210
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:39,750
Right.

1211
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:40,583
You know what I mean?

1212
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:44,170
Some things that are covering like that
with the padding over the front so that

1213
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:47,050
it doesn't go in the
eyes as a single point.

1214
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:48,603
But

1215
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:54,700
is there anybody even
playing with prototypes or
something like that and doing

1216
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:57,370
an exhibition or demonstration to,

1217
00:30:57,371 --> 00:30:58,080
good question.

1218
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:58,270
You know,

1219
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,860
I haven't seen anything compelling.

1220
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:01,660
I haven't seen anybody
come up with anything.

1221
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:02,051
Yeah.

1222
00:31:02,051 --> 00:31:02,771
It was my idea.

1223
00:31:02,771 --> 00:31:04,210
My idea was to have it like,

1224
00:31:04,211 --> 00:31:04,840
um,

1225
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,673
like,

1226
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:06,700
like uh,

1227
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,720
like old school,

1228
00:31:07,721 --> 00:31:08,350
bad glove.

1229
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:08,950
Yeah.

1230
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:09,221
Yeah.

1231
00:31:09,221 --> 00:31:09,471
You know,

1232
00:31:09,471 --> 00:31:14,400
like Joe Lewis with those old school bad
gloves because it's a very thin glove.

1233
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:17,680
They would cover the tips and they used
to hit the bag with them back in like

1234
00:31:17,681 --> 00:31:18,514
the fucking twenties.

1235
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:18,880
Yeah.

1236
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,440
It was just like leather and,

1237
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,240
and maybe maybe that's what it is.

1238
00:31:22,241 --> 00:31:22,541
Like,

1239
00:31:22,541 --> 00:31:23,170
um,

1240
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:26,940
Keith still got love and just kind
of a topping of that type of thing.

1241
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:28,540
That makes so much sense.

1242
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:28,880
Yeah.

1243
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,640
Why would the tips of the fingers,

1244
00:31:30,641 --> 00:31:32,110
like you don't in grappling,

1245
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,640
you never use individual,

1246
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:34,690
no cop.

1247
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,340
Everything is done like this.

1248
00:31:36,341 --> 00:31:36,670
Yeah.

1249
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:37,780
It wouldn't change anything.

1250
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,651
Nothing at all.

1251
00:31:38,651 --> 00:31:40,310
And change a single thing though.

1252
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:41,800
The only thing it changes is,

1253
00:31:41,801 --> 00:31:43,450
is yeah,

1254
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:43,841
cause he,

1255
00:31:43,841 --> 00:31:44,840
it doesn't even change this.

1256
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:45,260
No,

1257
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:45,470
no.

1258
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:46,010
I'm still here.

1259
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:47,500
It makes it better honestly.

1260
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:48,430
You have more grip.

1261
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:48,790
Yeah.

1262
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:50,050
Like if it's like a,

1263
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:50,561
you know,

1264
00:31:50,561 --> 00:31:51,450
like um,

1265
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,410
suede material,

1266
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:54,520
like something that's a little rough,

1267
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:56,020
you could actually get good.

1268
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:56,800
Yeah,

1269
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,340
that's true.

1270
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:01,710
It would help grappling because gloves
definitely hurt some submissions they get

1271
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:03,100
in the way of rear naked chokes.

1272
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:08,050
It's one of the reasons why Georgia
submission over Bisping was so impressive

1273
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:09,520
because he went this way.

1274
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:09,941
You know,

1275
00:32:09,941 --> 00:32:12,370
he went deep back of the
hand to the back of the neck,

1276
00:32:12,371 --> 00:32:13,240
the real way,

1277
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:16,660
which you don't sometimes you don't see
because the guy can't get the glove in

1278
00:32:16,661 --> 00:32:16,900
there.

1279
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:17,210
Yeah.

1280
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:18,280
That's the one that's on the,

1281
00:32:18,281 --> 00:32:20,210
on the display image of like,

1282
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:21,040
of,

1283
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,360
of Jujitsu jokes.

1284
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,120
I mean that one was fucking tight.

1285
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:27,660
That was crazy to watch George dude.

1286
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:28,781
But yeah,

1287
00:32:28,781 --> 00:32:30,040
they've got to figure out something.

1288
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,630
You don't need to have these open,

1289
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,340
it doesn't affect risk control.

1290
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:35,880
It doesn't affect any
kind of grappling in,

1291
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,060
in,

1292
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,450
in fact it would make it better.

1293
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,580
What does bell tour?

1294
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:39,893
There's one.

1295
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:41,091
Yeah,

1296
00:32:41,091 --> 00:32:42,110
Bella tour has done,

1297
00:32:42,111 --> 00:32:43,370
what pride did you,

1298
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,360
are they curved it?

1299
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:44,901
I like it.

1300
00:32:44,901 --> 00:32:45,950
They use an Everlast.

1301
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,780
Everlast is their glove manufacturer.

1302
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,880
Obviously they make fucking killer shit,

1303
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:51,470
but um,

1304
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:54,290
what they're doing is having it so it's,

1305
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:56,870
it's more difficult to
open your fingers up.

1306
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:57,770
That's a smart move.

1307
00:32:58,390 --> 00:33:00,320
It's a little little thicker.

1308
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:02,180
So you didn't see a lot of,

1309
00:33:02,181 --> 00:33:02,750
um,

1310
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:03,790
I tried.

1311
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:04,281
No,

1312
00:33:04,281 --> 00:33:04,850
you didn't.

1313
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:05,511
That's the point,

1314
00:33:05,511 --> 00:33:05,741
right?

1315
00:33:05,741 --> 00:33:05,900
Yeah.

1316
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:06,410
Yeah.

1317
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:06,950
It was very,

1318
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:08,480
it was the UFC,

1319
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:09,680
those gloves,

1320
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,650
it's almost harder to close than it is to,

1321
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:13,430
to open them.

1322
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:14,060
Yeah.

1323
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:14,893
And then,

1324
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:16,011
I don't know,

1325
00:33:16,011 --> 00:33:18,020
I feel like maybe it
was just the commission,

1326
00:33:18,021 --> 00:33:18,854
but I feel like,

1327
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:19,401
you know,

1328
00:33:19,401 --> 00:33:21,880
you always break it gloves then
you tried to break a man and let,

1329
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,240
cause they're stiff
when you first get them.

1330
00:33:23,241 --> 00:33:23,870
They're new.

1331
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:24,260
Um,

1332
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,730
but there was at least one commission.

1333
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:25,900
They,

1334
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,050
they wouldn't even let us like,

1335
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:27,321
you know,

1336
00:33:27,321 --> 00:33:29,910
break the gloves and they wouldn't
give you the gloves you had.

1337
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,550
You didn't get them until you put them on.

1338
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:34,040
That must be some amateur shit.

1339
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:35,270
Like some commission.

1340
00:33:35,271 --> 00:33:36,380
It doesn't know what they're doing yet.

1341
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:38,060
You all commission doesn't
know what they're doing.

1342
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:38,331
Not,

1343
00:33:38,331 --> 00:33:39,164
not the commission.

1344
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:39,920
Um,

1345
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,300
the hospitals after the,

1346
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:43,670
after the fight itself in New York,

1347
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:45,620
really mad in Brooklyn.

1348
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,180
I had the,

1349
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:46,371
the,

1350
00:33:46,371 --> 00:33:47,204
the crazy,

1351
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:47,991
well I had,

1352
00:33:47,991 --> 00:33:48,620
it wasn't me.

1353
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:51,410
Dustin poray had the craziest trip.

1354
00:33:51,411 --> 00:33:52,220
We,

1355
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:55,220
so after that fight with Jim
Miller with all those shin cakes,

1356
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:55,851
they were both,

1357
00:33:55,851 --> 00:34:00,080
they both went to the hospital with a
calf kicks and I'm Dustin's calf and Shin

1358
00:34:00,081 --> 00:34:01,580
was swollen and they will,

1359
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:03,620
I'm giving him some morphine and truck.

1360
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:05,140
We got there and they,

1361
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:09,200
the doctor came in and they wanted
to perform a surgery on him there.

1362
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:11,420
They wanted to slice his shin open,

1363
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:12,770
um,

1364
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:15,500
and relieve the pressure
because they were saying,

1365
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:19,670
you're going to lose nerve tissue
and your nerves are going to die.

1366
00:34:19,671 --> 00:34:20,120
And,

1367
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:20,781
and um,

1368
00:34:20,781 --> 00:34:20,961
you,

1369
00:34:20,961 --> 00:34:22,580
if you start not feeling when they go,

1370
00:34:22,581 --> 00:34:23,031
there's no,

1371
00:34:23,031 --> 00:34:23,900
and there's no coming back.

1372
00:34:23,901 --> 00:34:25,270
You can't fix it.

1373
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:26,330
You can't fix those things.

1374
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:27,530
Um,

1375
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:29,070
they were really pushing for this thing.

1376
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,740
It was just a crazy situation.

1377
00:34:30,741 --> 00:34:30,951
Right.

1378
00:34:30,951 --> 00:34:31,491
So we're like,

1379
00:34:31,491 --> 00:34:31,671
hey,

1380
00:34:31,671 --> 00:34:32,091
Dustin,

1381
00:34:32,091 --> 00:34:32,420
man.

1382
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:35,810
And then I called Mike Brown back then
and we started having this discussion

1383
00:34:35,811 --> 00:34:36,644
about,

1384
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,460
it's just like,

1385
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,211
it's leg kicks.

1386
00:34:38,211 --> 00:34:40,270
We've seen this all the time
and the thigh and whatnot.

1387
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:40,561
No,

1388
00:34:40,561 --> 00:34:41,560
when they're not in,

1389
00:34:41,561 --> 00:34:42,021
Dustin was like,

1390
00:34:42,021 --> 00:34:42,141
yeah,

1391
00:34:42,141 --> 00:34:42,974
I don't want to do that.

1392
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,120
Um,

1393
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,110
then they started,

1394
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:45,711
he was like,

1395
00:34:45,711 --> 00:34:45,801
yeah,

1396
00:34:45,801 --> 00:34:47,270
I want to get out of here basically.

1397
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:48,140
And he was like,

1398
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:49,400
can I just have something for the pain?

1399
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,050
And it felt like they were like,

1400
00:34:51,051 --> 00:34:51,884
no.

1401
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:52,461
They said,

1402
00:34:52,461 --> 00:34:53,270
no,

1403
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:55,760
we're not going to let you
leave here on pain medication.

1404
00:34:55,940 --> 00:35:00,380
And I felt like they were trying to keep
him the entice him to stay fucking pain

1405
00:35:00,381 --> 00:35:01,214
medication.

1406
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,860
It was just a really weird situation.

1407
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:07,160
And we were there for way too long and
they were really pushing for this like

1408
00:35:07,161 --> 00:35:08,470
three or four different doc.

1409
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,620
No three different doctors came in
and trying to convince him to get this

1410
00:35:12,621 --> 00:35:13,454
surgery done.

1411
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,330
Wow.

1412
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:15,170
It was crazy.

1413
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:17,720
Just for some swelling
to swelling in the calf.

1414
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:19,970
That doesn't make any sense.

1415
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:20,893
It doesn't,

1416
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:25,790
I honestly think that it would cause
nerve damage to have so much swelling.

1417
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:32,690
The swelling was pushing up against
the blood vessel supposedly.

1418
00:35:32,691 --> 00:35:34,310
And there wasn't,

1419
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:34,850
um,

1420
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:36,920
circulation coming
through that to what was,

1421
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:38,070
oh,

1422
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:38,491
this is,

1423
00:35:38,491 --> 00:35:39,310
this is what I,

1424
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:40,890
and this is a over a year ago,

1425
00:35:40,891 --> 00:35:42,420
so I'm trying to remember exactly.

1426
00:35:42,421 --> 00:35:43,370
And I'm not a met,

1427
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:44,310
I'm not a doctor.

1428
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:45,653
Um,

1429
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:46,820
but the,

1430
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:48,870
the swell and they were asking him about,

1431
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:49,260
um,

1432
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,400
cause he was having some,

1433
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:52,620
some loss of sensation right.

1434
00:35:52,621 --> 00:35:53,580
And his toes,

1435
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,290
but he had just fought,

1436
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:56,161
you know,

1437
00:35:56,161 --> 00:35:57,930
and they'd given him morphine
and all this other stuff.

1438
00:35:58,110 --> 00:35:58,441
So,

1439
00:35:58,441 --> 00:35:58,800
um,

1440
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,900
maybe no poking at his toes
with a pin or something.

1441
00:36:00,901 --> 00:36:02,250
You feel that he feel that and he's like,

1442
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:02,490
yeah,

1443
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:03,270
a little bit.

1444
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:04,060
No,

1445
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,550
you know these different answers.

1446
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,540
And um,

1447
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,040
they would,

1448
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,670
they claim to be concerned about it.

1449
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,410
They were telling him that this is what,

1450
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:13,530
this is a possibility and this is what's
going to happen and we want to prevent

1451
00:36:13,531 --> 00:36:14,364
it.

1452
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:15,331
They weren't like,

1453
00:36:15,331 --> 00:36:17,610
well this is guaranteed that
this is what's going on.

1454
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:20,700
This is just the realistic
possibility and we want to prevent it.

1455
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,230
And it was just like,

1456
00:36:22,231 --> 00:36:25,560
he wanted to wait as long as
possible and they were just,

1457
00:36:25,561 --> 00:36:28,410
they just seem to be really
pushy about wanting to do this.

1458
00:36:28,411 --> 00:36:30,750
So where would they're going
to make the incision in?

1459
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:32,400
In the Shin

1460
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:35,423
up the shin.

1461
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,473
How big?

1462
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:37,913
It was big.

1463
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:39,480
It was just as long as my phone.

1464
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,200
What?

1465
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,180
So that list instead.

1466
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,510
That's why we were like,

1467
00:36:42,511 --> 00:36:42,721
yeah,

1468
00:36:42,721 --> 00:36:43,800
this is kind of crazy.

1469
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:46,200
And they were just want to drain
it and they want to drain it.

1470
00:36:46,201 --> 00:36:47,610
They want to release the pressure.

1471
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,390
Right.

1472
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:49,440
And then they were like,

1473
00:36:49,441 --> 00:36:49,591
well,

1474
00:36:49,591 --> 00:36:49,950
we can,

1475
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:51,390
there's a test that we can do.

1476
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:52,920
You can't really see it from that angle.

1477
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:55,000
But then it was so much
worse than the hospital.

1478
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:56,880
They were like,

1479
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:57,151
there's,

1480
00:36:57,151 --> 00:36:57,391
there's,

1481
00:36:57,391 --> 00:36:57,750
uh,

1482
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:57,991
he,

1483
00:36:57,991 --> 00:36:58,920
when Dustin was like,

1484
00:36:58,921 --> 00:36:59,191
I don't,

1485
00:36:59,191 --> 00:37:00,060
I don't like that idea.

1486
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,051
I don't want to do that.

1487
00:37:01,051 --> 00:37:01,430
And they were,

1488
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:02,700
I don't think that let's just wait.

1489
00:37:02,701 --> 00:37:03,121
And he's like,

1490
00:37:03,121 --> 00:37:03,281
well,

1491
00:37:03,281 --> 00:37:03,721
they were like,

1492
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:04,320
well,

1493
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,640
there's a thing that we can do,

1494
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,620
but we have to take a needle.

1495
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:09,720
And they wanted to take
a neat along needle,

1496
00:37:09,721 --> 00:37:11,010
stick it into his leg,

1497
00:37:11,011 --> 00:37:14,610
past the bone into the muscle and
like do a pressure test on it.

1498
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:15,991
And he was like,

1499
00:37:15,991 --> 00:37:16,171
yeah,

1500
00:37:16,171 --> 00:37:17,004
I don't like,

1501
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,230
it was crazy because he
doesn't like needles.

1502
00:37:19,231 --> 00:37:19,710
Right.

1503
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:20,770
That's the HDLs.

1504
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:21,421
And I'll be like,

1505
00:37:21,421 --> 00:37:25,050
all these title fights were
living scared of needles.

1506
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,850
I'm the same way about needles,

1507
00:37:26,851 --> 00:37:28,350
but I don't have the tattoos that kid has,

1508
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,640
but he's just like,

1509
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:30,660
I don't want to do that.

1510
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:31,531
I don't want like,

1511
00:37:31,531 --> 00:37:31,951
he's like,

1512
00:37:31,951 --> 00:37:32,101
no,

1513
00:37:32,101 --> 00:37:35,430
cause they wanted it would have been
this much in it inside his shit.

1514
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:37,170
Yeah.

1515
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:38,610
I don't know how long it would have been,

1516
00:37:38,611 --> 00:37:40,160
but it wasn't.

1517
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:40,980
Yeah,

1518
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:44,430
it wasn't just like looking for vein
and they were just testing for pressure.

1519
00:37:44,431 --> 00:37:44,770
They will,

1520
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:47,850
they will like talk and they was saying
they wanted to test her tire gauge in

1521
00:37:47,851 --> 00:37:50,040
there and showed exactly doing

1522
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:52,771
so,

1523
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:53,280
so,

1524
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,330
so anyway,

1525
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,710
they didn't happen.

1526
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:56,870
The dust we started,

1527
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,210
Dustin's started getting frustrated and,

1528
00:37:58,211 --> 00:37:58,510
and,

1529
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:00,360
and they really pushing for it.

1530
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:04,410
It was late at night and I don't think I
was helping the situation because I was

1531
00:38:04,411 --> 00:38:05,070
like,

1532
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:06,330
these guys are probably interns.

1533
00:38:06,331 --> 00:38:08,760
They probably back there with
like a chart and they're like,

1534
00:38:08,761 --> 00:38:09,120
they get,

1535
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,690
they get bonus points for
whatever surgery that he can,

1536
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:12,863
you know,

1537
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:13,741
you never know,

1538
00:38:13,741 --> 00:38:14,280
man.

1539
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,860
People are really skeptical
about our kind of stuff.

1540
00:38:16,861 --> 00:38:18,360
But you know what I mean?

1541
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,530
They definitely do surgeries on
people that you don't have to.

1542
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,640
Some doctors too.

1543
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:25,080
It definitely can happen.

1544
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:25,241
I mean,

1545
00:38:25,241 --> 00:38:27,420
you'd hope that you're not
running into one of those doctors,

1546
00:38:27,421 --> 00:38:28,710
but they have done it before.

1547
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:29,340
Yeah.

1548
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:33,220
I mean there's a doctor that got just
got arrested recently and there was a

1549
00:38:33,221 --> 00:38:37,030
whole story about all the
different surgeries that he
did that he didn't have to

1550
00:38:37,031 --> 00:38:40,600
do and including cancer surgeries,

1551
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,420
like he removed cancer on people
that didn't even have cancer.

1552
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:43,990
Yeah.

1553
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:44,381
Yeah.

1554
00:38:44,381 --> 00:38:44,681
That's,

1555
00:38:44,681 --> 00:38:45,550
that's a scam.

1556
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:46,930
Just started driving fat.

1557
00:38:46,931 --> 00:38:49,270
Mercedes got to make those payments.

1558
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:51,670
He should just got into the
plastic surgery business.

1559
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:52,121
I know,

1560
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:52,760
right?

1561
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:55,060
Do you could talk those crazy
ladies into to anything,

1562
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,350
anything and everything.

1563
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,310
You need some unique,

1564
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:58,950
you need to take some of
that meat out of your button.

1565
00:38:58,990 --> 00:38:59,823
Putting your lips.

1566
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:00,920
Yeah.

1567
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:01,960
That's the move.

1568
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:03,790
Meaty Buck Lips.

1569
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:07,660
So will they ice in the
Shin the entire time?

1570
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,350
They were.

1571
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:09,310
They had ice on it.

1572
00:39:09,311 --> 00:39:10,150
They had a drip,

1573
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:12,760
like a morphine drip to kill the pain.

1574
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:16,540
Why didn't they just wait a couple of
days while they want to just go right into

1575
00:39:16,541 --> 00:39:17,051
it right now?

1576
00:39:17,051 --> 00:39:17,884
They wanted,

1577
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:20,520
they wanted to do it that night and they,

1578
00:39:20,521 --> 00:39:21,041
they said,

1579
00:39:21,041 --> 00:39:24,550
they said they didn't want or the
reason why they didn't want to wait was

1580
00:39:24,551 --> 00:39:27,190
because when the nerve
nerve damage happens,

1581
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:28,240
when the nerves die,

1582
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:28,870
that's it.

1583
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:29,410
They're debt.

1584
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:30,243
There's no way to,

1585
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:31,083
you know,

1586
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,040
to bring those things back.

1587
00:39:33,041 --> 00:39:34,860
So man,

1588
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:36,550
I just uh,

1589
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,250
I wonder what if that's right.

1590
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:42,100
I don't want to be taught
at shit about the doctors.

1591
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:46,510
It's not right because Dustin
fought again after that.

1592
00:39:46,511 --> 00:39:48,840
Eddie both flag and he's
fighting in a few weeks.

1593
00:39:48,841 --> 00:39:50,140
Like when was his leg better?

1594
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:51,580
Um,

1595
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:51,971
shoot,

1596
00:39:51,971 --> 00:39:53,920
he got on a plane the next day,

1597
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:55,090
so I had a hat.

1598
00:39:55,091 --> 00:39:56,500
Real quick little side note.

1599
00:39:56,830 --> 00:39:57,810
I had had some problems.

1600
00:39:57,811 --> 00:40:01,600
I was helping him for that camp
and I had an injury and um,

1601
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:05,470
I got Tylenol with codeine in it and man,

1602
00:40:05,471 --> 00:40:06,304
that stuff,

1603
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:06,850
that's,

1604
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:08,230
that's powerful medicine.

1605
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,210
How powerful is that?

1606
00:40:11,211 --> 00:40:11,950
It was po.

1607
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:12,401
I was like,

1608
00:40:12,401 --> 00:40:13,234
I couldn't,

1609
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:14,800
Dustin took me to the hospital.

1610
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:15,790
I know I went in,

1611
00:40:15,791 --> 00:40:16,021
I was,

1612
00:40:16,021 --> 00:40:17,740
I was in so much pain and they were like,

1613
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:21,760
they prescribed that I took one pill
and about 20 minutes later I was like,

1614
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:25,720
it was the first time I was able to
relax and like three days the pain was so

1615
00:40:25,721 --> 00:40:27,190
bad and I was like,

1616
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:28,150
when I get bad,

1617
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:29,280
I got to the end of my cat,

1618
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:30,040
my thing.

1619
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,170
I like two pills left and I was like,

1620
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,130
I don't need them.

1621
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:35,710
I'll keep them in case I get hurt again,

1622
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:36,370
some point,

1623
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:37,203
you know.

1624
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:37,900
And um,

1625
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,030
fortunately I had them because I was like,

1626
00:40:40,031 --> 00:40:40,450
dude,

1627
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:41,111
like this,

1628
00:40:41,111 --> 00:40:41,381
that,

1629
00:40:41,381 --> 00:40:41,621
that,

1630
00:40:41,621 --> 00:40:43,540
that pain that you're going
through when you get on a plane.

1631
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:44,440
Because I was in Japan,

1632
00:40:44,441 --> 00:40:48,190
I had busted my foot and then I had to
fly 16 hours and my foot was swelling on

1633
00:40:48,191 --> 00:40:49,024
the plane,

1634
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:51,430
the pressure of high altitude,

1635
00:40:51,431 --> 00:40:52,210
it was miserable.

1636
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:52,961
It started in my,

1637
00:40:52,961 --> 00:40:53,351
in my,

1638
00:40:53,351 --> 00:40:56,470
in my foot and my ankle and it's swollen
up into my Shin and calf all the way

1639
00:40:56,471 --> 00:40:57,340
down into my toes.

1640
00:40:57,790 --> 00:40:58,690
But it was so,

1641
00:40:58,691 --> 00:40:59,171
I was like,

1642
00:40:59,171 --> 00:40:59,441
that's,

1643
00:40:59,441 --> 00:41:00,610
I don't want that to happen to you.

1644
00:41:00,611 --> 00:41:01,340
So like,

1645
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:01,631
like,

1646
00:41:01,631 --> 00:41:02,650
it's going to be miserable,

1647
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,750
but just take this with
you and take a pill,

1648
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:05,440
you know?

1649
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:05,771
Um,

1650
00:41:05,771 --> 00:41:05,960
he,

1651
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,120
he just took one pill.

1652
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,800
He said it was a great feeling.

1653
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:10,450
It helped with the help with the flight.

1654
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:13,780
I got ahold of some of that old
school nyquil back when day.

1655
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:17,080
I've only taken it like maybe two
or three times ever in my life,

1656
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:20,620
but the last time I got
some was like 20 years ago,

1657
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:21,850
I took some,

1658
00:41:21,851 --> 00:41:26,080
I was sick and I took old school nyquil
and I was lying in bed and it was like

1659
00:41:26,081 --> 00:41:26,500
my,

1660
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,510
my bed was just hugging me.

1661
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:32,170
My bed was made out of love and it
was just hugging me and I was like,

1662
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,520
ah,

1663
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:34,010
I didn't give

1664
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:35,210
a fuck about that cold.

1665
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,370
I was just so relaxed.

1666
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,310
Like old school.

1667
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:39,560
NYQUIL's amazing.

1668
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,120
I remember that.

1669
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:41,540
I own,

1670
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,350
that's coding right,

1671
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:42,860
isn't it?

1672
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:45,300
I think coding was a Nyquil ooze.

1673
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,970
Nice man back in the day.

1674
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:47,480
Um,

1675
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,440
Tito Ortiz.

1676
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:49,240
I,

1677
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,170
I called Tito at one point
because I was real sick.

1678
00:41:51,171 --> 00:41:52,310
I had a fight coming up too,

1679
00:41:52,311 --> 00:41:52,731
and I was like,

1680
00:41:52,731 --> 00:41:53,031
man,

1681
00:41:53,031 --> 00:41:53,411
I don't,

1682
00:41:53,411 --> 00:41:54,320
I don't know what to do.

1683
00:41:54,321 --> 00:41:54,920
He's like,

1684
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:55,753
here's what you do.

1685
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:59,300
You take three packs a theraflu and
you put that in one cup of water.

1686
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:00,343
Right?

1687
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:08,810
So,

1688
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:09,231
so he's like,

1689
00:42:09,231 --> 00:42:10,040
you boil it,

1690
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:12,530
you boil the water and you pour
that and you put three facts.

1691
00:42:12,531 --> 00:42:13,700
Type Theraflu went there.

1692
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:14,691
I was like,

1693
00:42:14,691 --> 00:42:15,524
um,

1694
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,120
I,

1695
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,750
I started to do it and I was like,

1696
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:18,081
man,

1697
00:42:18,081 --> 00:42:19,250
Tito is a light heavyweight.

1698
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:22,070
That's a good move.

1699
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:23,760
I'm glad you did that.

1700
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:24,603
I'm trying to go to,

1701
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,650
cause I was out for 18 hours.

1702
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,660
I laid down,

1703
00:42:29,661 --> 00:42:31,160
I woke up and I still,

1704
00:42:31,161 --> 00:42:32,150
I felt like I,

1705
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:33,290
I just don't want to get up.

1706
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:33,891
And I slept.

1707
00:42:33,891 --> 00:42:34,520
I slept for,

1708
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,110
I was in bed for 18 hours.

1709
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:38,000
I did wake up feeling better though.

1710
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:41,960
Like I would imagine you probably
weren't thinking about the cold at all.

1711
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:42,201
No.

1712
00:42:42,201 --> 00:42:45,410
So the stress was gone and
you're getting that rest.

1713
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:46,370
You're out cold.

1714
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:48,530
I know I was laid out.

1715
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,640
I was one of the biggest it,

1716
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:55,190
that's one of the best arguments for like
cold medicine is that they let you go

1717
00:42:55,191 --> 00:42:55,701
to sleep.

1718
00:42:55,701 --> 00:42:57,200
Like if I'm sick and miserable,

1719
00:42:57,201 --> 00:42:58,280
I can't fucking sleep.

1720
00:42:58,310 --> 00:42:58,820
Yeah.

1721
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:02,660
But if you take something and you
just fucking Theraflu is a good one,

1722
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:03,200
you just,

1723
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,070
it cleans you out.

1724
00:43:04,071 --> 00:43:06,410
Like you could breathe and
just calm the fuck out.

1725
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:07,330
And,

1726
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:08,570
and isn't that when you,

1727
00:43:08,571 --> 00:43:09,290
um,

1728
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:09,981
what does this chamber,

1729
00:43:09,981 --> 00:43:12,370
that old school night call it
had a pseudoephedrine Annette,

1730
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:14,360
which is what is used to make math.

1731
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:15,470
Oh Jesus.

1732
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:17,390
Math keep you up.

1733
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:18,141
Yeah.

1734
00:43:18,141 --> 00:43:18,920
It doesn't mean any sense.

1735
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,660
A stimulant says sudafed.

1736
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:22,340
I got to Google what it was.

1737
00:43:22,341 --> 00:43:22,880
This is what,

1738
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:23,061
yeah,

1739
00:43:23,061 --> 00:43:24,590
but sudafed is not nyquil.

1740
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:26,360
That's very different.

1741
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:30,230
Sudafeds a stimulant sudafed to the
stuff that cleans your nose out.

1742
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:30,651
Right,

1743
00:43:30,651 --> 00:43:31,160
right.

1744
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,520
This is what doing like what,

1745
00:43:33,521 --> 00:43:34,820
how to pseudoephedrine Oh,

1746
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:38,690
the reason why I called the original
green death formula Nyquil's behind the

1747
00:43:38,691 --> 00:43:40,670
pharmacy counter now because gasp,

1748
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,490
it has the evil pseudoephedrine it.

1749
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:42,981
Oh,

1750
00:43:42,981 --> 00:43:44,690
so you can buy that shit still.

1751
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:45,680
Some people were looking at,

1752
00:43:45,681 --> 00:43:48,020
I was finding an article someone
was looking for it in New York.

1753
00:43:48,050 --> 00:43:49,280
That's 2013.

1754
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:50,540
I got to get a good doctor.

1755
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:51,860
Might be able to find some stuff.

1756
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:54,373
Interesting.

1757
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:56,390
That stuff fucks you up.

1758
00:43:57,710 --> 00:43:59,090
You go deep with that stuff.

1759
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:03,500
I think it's the chemical that it's mixed
with the pseudoephedrine is probably

1760
00:44:03,501 --> 00:44:04,550
what keeps you alive.

1761
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:07,040
Coding.

1762
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,810
What's the drag you down into the grave.

1763
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,060
The pseudoephedrine shit keeps you alive.

1764
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:12,950
That's the thing about
about sleeping though,

1765
00:44:12,951 --> 00:44:13,251
right?

1766
00:44:13,251 --> 00:44:13,731
That's when,

1767
00:44:13,731 --> 00:44:14,390
um,

1768
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:15,223
when your body,

1769
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:18,320
everything else is off to
all your body can do is,

1770
00:44:18,321 --> 00:44:18,800
is,

1771
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:19,633
is heal.

1772
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:21,050
You know what else happens man.

1773
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:25,460
You make good decisions
like that term sleep on it.

1774
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:26,780
That's not a joke.

1775
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:27,290
Yeah.

1776
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:29,960
There's something about going
to sleep with a problem,

1777
00:44:29,961 --> 00:44:32,100
waking up in the morning and
you have a new perspective.

1778
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:32,341
Like,

1779
00:44:32,341 --> 00:44:32,510
Hey,

1780
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:33,450
it's not that big a deal.

1781
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:34,170
Our ads,

1782
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:34,980
all right,

1783
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:35,813
I don't care.

1784
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:36,601
Or you know,

1785
00:44:36,601 --> 00:44:38,970
or maybe I should do something about
this or maybe I should apologize.

1786
00:44:38,971 --> 00:44:39,670
Maybe I should,

1787
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:41,850
you know something about
sleeping on something.

1788
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:42,810
I don't know what it is,

1789
00:44:42,811 --> 00:44:43,081
man,

1790
00:44:43,081 --> 00:44:47,460
but it gives me a truer compass
as to which direction I should go.

1791
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:49,500
There's a thing about that too.

1792
00:44:49,501 --> 00:44:49,800
There's,

1793
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,510
I'm sleeping on it.

1794
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:52,583
I,

1795
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:56,330
I had to teach myself some things
about like car mechanics and I,

1796
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,330
I had a problem,

1797
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,231
but it's somebody who's like,

1798
00:44:58,231 --> 00:44:59,100
that's your alternator.

1799
00:44:59,190 --> 00:44:59,460
It like,

1800
00:44:59,460 --> 00:44:59,630
what?

1801
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:01,200
Cause my engine wouldn't stay on,

1802
00:45:01,201 --> 00:45:01,960
you know,

1803
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:02,793
it was like,

1804
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:03,510
really?

1805
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:04,740
It's like how much does that cost?

1806
00:45:04,741 --> 00:45:05,610
And I was broke.

1807
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:06,240
That was in,

1808
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,470
I was just fighting,

1809
00:45:07,471 --> 00:45:07,751
you know,

1810
00:45:07,751 --> 00:45:08,130
it was,

1811
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:10,170
there was no UFC even on the horizon yet.

1812
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:11,160
Um,

1813
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:11,993
and I'm,

1814
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:13,050
I'm like,

1815
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:15,720
how much that cost as like too much shit.

1816
00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:16,290
I was like,

1817
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:16,680
he's like,

1818
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:17,431
I can do it for you.

1819
00:45:17,431 --> 00:45:17,761
And he's like,

1820
00:45:17,761 --> 00:45:18,241
you can do it.

1821
00:45:18,241 --> 00:45:18,550
And it's like,

1822
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:19,050
how are you going to,

1823
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:19,341
I was like,

1824
00:45:19,341 --> 00:45:20,520
I can't afford that either,

1825
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:21,840
but if you can do it,

1826
00:45:21,870 --> 00:45:22,710
I'll figure it out.

1827
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:23,970
So I went to the store,

1828
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:24,804
I was like,

1829
00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:25,021
Hey,

1830
00:45:25,021 --> 00:45:26,550
I need to buy an alternator for this,

1831
00:45:26,610 --> 00:45:27,570
this model car.

1832
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:28,231
They were like,

1833
00:45:28,231 --> 00:45:28,531
okay.

1834
00:45:28,531 --> 00:45:29,670
They bring it out and they're like,

1835
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:30,600
they weren't going,

1836
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,910
they weren't going to give it to me
cause you have to give them the other one

1837
00:45:32,911 --> 00:45:33,420
back.

1838
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:34,470
You have to exchange it.

1839
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:34,920
Really?

1840
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:35,610
Yeah.

1841
00:45:35,610 --> 00:45:38,400
Like at least this is the way
it was in like 2000 Texas,

1842
00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:39,210
you know?

1843
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:39,860
So,

1844
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:40,170
um,

1845
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:42,420
but fortunately one of the
managers that that store was,

1846
00:45:42,421 --> 00:45:44,580
one of my students is right
across the street from my gym.

1847
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:45,571
So I was like,

1848
00:45:45,571 --> 00:45:46,021
he was like,

1849
00:45:46,021 --> 00:45:46,860
here you can take it,

1850
00:45:46,861 --> 00:45:48,060
just bring the alternator back.

1851
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:48,391
I was like,

1852
00:45:48,391 --> 00:45:48,751
awesome.

1853
00:45:48,751 --> 00:45:50,220
Because I didn't know
what an alternator was.

1854
00:45:50,221 --> 00:45:51,480
My plan was to grab it,

1855
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:53,250
go look in my engine and said like,

1856
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:53,611
fine,

1857
00:45:53,611 --> 00:45:54,211
this is fine.

1858
00:45:54,211 --> 00:45:55,044
The like thing,

1859
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:55,560
right.

1860
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:56,281
So that's what I did.

1861
00:45:56,281 --> 00:45:57,180
I found the like thing,

1862
00:45:57,330 --> 00:45:58,163
I put it in there.

1863
00:45:58,980 --> 00:45:59,161
Oh,

1864
00:45:59,161 --> 00:45:59,671
I changed it.

1865
00:45:59,671 --> 00:46:00,540
I took the other one back,

1866
00:46:00,541 --> 00:46:01,890
but I couldn't get the belt on.

1867
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:04,950
I did everything that I was trying to do
everything and somebody who's like the

1868
00:46:04,951 --> 00:46:05,940
tensioning bolt and I was like,

1869
00:46:05,941 --> 00:46:07,050
I don't know what you're talking about.

1870
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:08,280
And I slept on it.

1871
00:46:08,281 --> 00:46:09,420
I went to bed that night.

1872
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:10,920
I went to sleep and I woke up,

1873
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:12,600
ran downstairs,

1874
00:46:12,810 --> 00:46:13,471
connected it,

1875
00:46:13,471 --> 00:46:15,750
you know like I cause overnight.

1876
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:19,980
But there was something about being
relaxed and not being like stressed about

1877
00:46:19,981 --> 00:46:20,641
trying to find it.

1878
00:46:20,641 --> 00:46:21,900
Right now it's right in front of me.

1879
00:46:22,230 --> 00:46:26,370
I'm just away from it and I see the whole
engine in my sleep and it's like you

1880
00:46:26,371 --> 00:46:29,070
put the ratchet in there and
you pull on it and that's,

1881
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:30,180
that's the tensioning bolt.

1882
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:33,600
I have a crazy spiritual idea about that.

1883
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:35,140
I think when you go to sleep,

1884
00:46:35,141 --> 00:46:36,390
you go into the spirit world.

1885
00:46:36,450 --> 00:46:38,010
When you come back you're refreshed.

1886
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:40,200
I think you live a new life every morning.

1887
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:42,241
Thank you.

1888
00:46:42,241 --> 00:46:44,010
Live on the momentum of your past life.

1889
00:46:44,310 --> 00:46:47,610
But I think you have a new life every
morning you just returned from the spirit

1890
00:46:47,611 --> 00:46:50,880
world with the mess that you left
behind and you got to clean it up,

1891
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:52,860
clean it up and figure it out and like,

1892
00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:53,461
oh yeah,

1893
00:46:53,461 --> 00:46:55,380
I should have just cranked
it bolt over there.

1894
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:56,273
Okay.

1895
00:46:56,350 --> 00:46:57,990
It all makes sense.

1896
00:46:57,991 --> 00:47:00,630
There's something to that cause I got
some stuff going on now where I'm just

1897
00:47:00,631 --> 00:47:01,464
like,

1898
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:02,910
when I wake up the next day and I'm like,

1899
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:03,744
you know what,

1900
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:04,730
it's not that big of,

1901
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:05,910
it's not that big of a deal.

1902
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:06,330
Yeah.

1903
00:47:06,330 --> 00:47:08,520
Most things are not that big of a deal.

1904
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:11,820
If you're still alive and you're
walking around and talking,

1905
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:13,500
ultimately it's not that big of a deal.

1906
00:47:13,501 --> 00:47:16,500
Like I give things like the 10 year test,

1907
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:18,090
like if you look back on 10 years,

1908
00:47:18,091 --> 00:47:21,180
how much of a big deal it was just
going to be not that big of a deal.

1909
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:21,751
Yeah.

1910
00:47:21,751 --> 00:47:22,800
It was fucking alternator.

1911
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:27,270
That big of a deal at 10
year test is a good test.

1912
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:27,901
Yeah,

1913
00:47:27,901 --> 00:47:28,920
that makes a lot of sense.

1914
00:47:29,770 --> 00:47:30,280
But people

1915
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:31,480
operate on momentum.

1916
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:33,010
That's a big problem with people.

1917
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:33,581
You know,

1918
00:47:33,581 --> 00:47:34,540
like when you go to bed,

1919
00:47:34,541 --> 00:47:35,351
you wake up in the morning,

1920
00:47:35,351 --> 00:47:35,531
you'd,

1921
00:47:35,531 --> 00:47:40,531
you still got this shit that you left
behind the day before piling up bills you

1922
00:47:40,661 --> 00:47:44,680
gotta pay and chores you get to do and
all these different tasks that need to

1923
00:47:44,681 --> 00:47:45,221
get done.

1924
00:47:45,221 --> 00:47:46,054
Like fuck.

1925
00:47:46,490 --> 00:47:46,680
You know,

1926
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:47,920
like you can't never get behind it.

1927
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:48,271
It's,

1928
00:47:48,271 --> 00:47:48,500
it's,

1929
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:51,460
it's a good day when when he feel like,

1930
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:51,941
okay,

1931
00:47:51,941 --> 00:47:56,110
everything's done and like
this day is completely mine.

1932
00:47:56,170 --> 00:47:56,651
Yeah.

1933
00:47:56,651 --> 00:47:57,220
Man,

1934
00:47:57,220 --> 00:47:58,060
that's fucking,

1935
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:03,360
that's to to to have like a clean slate
in your mind in terms of things you need

1936
00:48:03,791 --> 00:48:04,600
to do.

1937
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:07,540
There's no way to underestimate that.

1938
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:08,680
That's giant.

1939
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:11,380
You can't underemphasize
how important that is.

1940
00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:11,860
Yeah.

1941
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:13,060
Or overemphasized rather.

1942
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:15,190
I completely agree with that is um,

1943
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:18,070
I'm one of those guys who my brain,

1944
00:48:18,071 --> 00:48:21,690
I feel like as soon as I wake up first
thought leads into the next and to the

1945
00:48:21,691 --> 00:48:22,560
next and you,

1946
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:23,260
you,

1947
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:27,430
you can't stay ahead of it
and not staying ahead of it.

1948
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:27,531
You're,

1949
00:48:27,531 --> 00:48:29,080
you're kind of being dragged along,

1950
00:48:29,081 --> 00:48:31,300
being pulled by these thoughts and
all these different directions.

1951
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:33,600
Especially when I'm trying
to organize some things.

1952
00:48:33,601 --> 00:48:34,181
Sometimes I,

1953
00:48:34,181 --> 00:48:36,580
if I don't have a list
or something like that,

1954
00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:37,660
I'm not going to get,

1955
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:38,800
if I have five things to do,

1956
00:48:38,801 --> 00:48:39,730
let me get one thing done.

1957
00:48:39,731 --> 00:48:40,570
If I don't have a list,

1958
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:41,021
you know,

1959
00:48:41,021 --> 00:48:43,450
what changed a lot of my life.

1960
00:48:43,930 --> 00:48:45,700
I started working out
early in the morning.

1961
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:47,350
My,

1962
00:48:47,350 --> 00:48:50,260
my day almost always starts out.

1963
00:48:50,290 --> 00:48:52,150
Today's one of the rare
days where it didn't,

1964
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:54,370
like today I'm going to
work out after the podcast,

1965
00:48:54,610 --> 00:48:58,450
but most days I get up in the morning
and I work out and the only reason why I

1966
00:48:58,451 --> 00:49:01,810
didn't do it today is because
everyone in my house is sick.

1967
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:04,540
Everyone and I wanted to get some sleep.

1968
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:04,900
Yeah.

1969
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,610
My kids are little petri dishes,

1970
00:49:06,611 --> 00:49:07,270
man.

1971
00:49:07,270 --> 00:49:08,350
They're just always sick.

1972
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:09,580
Everybody's sick.

1973
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:11,050
So I'm,

1974
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:13,210
I'm the only one so far that's
been able to fight it off.

1975
00:49:13,211 --> 00:49:14,740
And I woke up yesterday and I'm like,

1976
00:49:14,770 --> 00:49:15,041
Ooh,

1977
00:49:15,041 --> 00:49:16,750
I got a sore throat like it's coming.

1978
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:19,580
And I fought it off yesterday
and I fought it off to,

1979
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:20,680
I got in the sauna,

1980
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:21,573
chilled out.

1981
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,950
But something changed in my life.

1982
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:25,930
When I started working out in the morning,

1983
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:28,530
my thought process became clearer.

1984
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:29,710
It May,

1985
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:33,400
it makes more sense because I
clean out my mind when I workout.

1986
00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:34,301
So I get up in,

1987
00:49:34,301 --> 00:49:38,290
the first thing I do is just go
work out and clean up my mind.

1988
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:41,980
My mind gets cleaned up
on my body's like fully,

1989
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:42,580
uh,

1990
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:44,320
elevated in terms of like,

1991
00:49:44,321 --> 00:49:45,970
my heart rate got jacked up.

1992
00:49:45,971 --> 00:49:47,260
I'm sweating like a pig.

1993
00:49:47,261 --> 00:49:49,120
I already strained already pushed,

1994
00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:54,190
already got over some shit already
made it to the end and then so there's

1995
00:49:54,191 --> 00:49:55,930
already a victory by the time it's,

1996
00:49:55,931 --> 00:49:56,141
you know,

1997
00:49:56,141 --> 00:49:57,310
8:00 AM yeah.

1998
00:49:57,430 --> 00:49:57,821
That,

1999
00:49:57,821 --> 00:50:01,180
that to me like then my day
just starts off way better.

2000
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:04,390
Like I start off with a clear perspective.

2001
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:05,470
Yeah.

2002
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:08,320
I guess it's similar when I,

2003
00:50:08,321 --> 00:50:11,440
especially when I was
fighting because you woke up,

2004
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:12,760
get a run in,

2005
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:13,420
eat something,

2006
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:14,253
head to the gym,

2007
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:14,811
you know,

2008
00:50:14,811 --> 00:50:18,100
and then you train now
that especially run fasted.

2009
00:50:18,970 --> 00:50:19,390
Yeah.

2010
00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:20,223
I like,

2011
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:20,681
I would,

2012
00:50:20,681 --> 00:50:21,670
that would be the first thing I did.

2013
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:23,080
I brushed my teeth and go for a run.

2014
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:23,711
You know,

2015
00:50:23,711 --> 00:50:23,851
I,

2016
00:50:23,851 --> 00:50:24,684
I didn't,

2017
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:27,010
I didn't like eating anything.

2018
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,040
This is when you were living in

2019
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:28,520
Texas.

2020
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:30,350
This is whenever like,

2021
00:50:30,351 --> 00:50:32,330
even to this day when I run like,

2022
00:50:32,990 --> 00:50:35,450
especially especially in
Texas because in the summer

2023
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,530
you got to go early before it
turns into a barbecue outside.

2024
00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:41,463
Exactly.

2025
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:42,710
What I was gonna say is in Texas,

2026
00:50:42,711 --> 00:50:43,910
your d mostly flat.

2027
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:44,833
It's mostly flat.

2028
00:50:44,970 --> 00:50:45,550
Especially,

2029
00:50:45,550 --> 00:50:47,060
especially in Houston.

2030
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:48,410
Austin has some hills,

2031
00:50:49,610 --> 00:50:51,140
but Houston is there.

2032
00:50:51,141 --> 00:50:51,760
They're the,

2033
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,600
the only hills in Houston
or the overpasses on.

2034
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:55,190
But now they're out here.

2035
00:50:55,191 --> 00:50:55,401
Man.

2036
00:50:55,401 --> 00:50:57,200
There's some ferocious trails you can run.

2037
00:50:57,790 --> 00:50:58,390
Yeah,

2038
00:50:58,390 --> 00:50:58,851
there is a,

2039
00:50:58,851 --> 00:51:00,860
there was a hill on my street that's,

2040
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:01,880
I'm a quarter mile.

2041
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:02,510
Oh,

2042
00:51:02,510 --> 00:51:03,350
that's miserable.

2043
00:51:03,370 --> 00:51:03,641
Yeah.

2044
00:51:03,641 --> 00:51:05,240
This is a miserable shit
in the Hollywood hills.

2045
00:51:05,241 --> 00:51:05,481
Like,

2046
00:51:05,481 --> 00:51:06,314
whoa.

2047
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:06,741
Yeah.

2048
00:51:06,741 --> 00:51:09,050
If you wanted to get at the bottom
and do some sprints going up,

2049
00:51:09,051 --> 00:51:09,500
it,

2050
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:10,910
that's so good for your knees too,

2051
00:51:11,090 --> 00:51:11,601
because you know,

2052
00:51:11,601 --> 00:51:13,370
you're not really a stomping down.

2053
00:51:13,610 --> 00:51:13,851
You know,

2054
00:51:13,851 --> 00:51:14,210
you're,

2055
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:15,043
you're pushing,

2056
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:15,950
you're pushing up.

2057
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:16,813
So it's just,

2058
00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:18,950
it's basically like
doing a bunch of lunges.

2059
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:19,873
Yeah.

2060
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:20,571
Yeah.

2061
00:51:20,571 --> 00:51:21,620
You feel it in your ass,

2062
00:51:21,650 --> 00:51:22,190
dude.

2063
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:23,750
My ass is way bigger than it used to be.

2064
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:25,093
It looks good.

2065
00:51:28,610 --> 00:51:29,031
There was a,

2066
00:51:29,031 --> 00:51:29,601
there was a,

2067
00:51:29,601 --> 00:51:30,320
there was a drill.

2068
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:31,910
Went and I did this a couple of times.

2069
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:32,773
Um,

2070
00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:33,470
you,

2071
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:35,690
they would incline the treadmill to the,

2072
00:51:35,691 --> 00:51:40,691
to its peak and then turn it up to like
12 or 10 or 12 and you're sprinting for

2073
00:51:41,091 --> 00:51:42,260
like 15 seconds.

2074
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:43,400
That was miserable.

2075
00:51:43,401 --> 00:51:43,731
I would,

2076
00:51:43,731 --> 00:51:44,930
you'd feel that really,

2077
00:51:44,931 --> 00:51:45,471
really hard.

2078
00:51:45,471 --> 00:51:47,150
I had to wait until you fall off.

2079
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:47,391
Yeah,

2080
00:51:47,391 --> 00:51:47,901
exactly.

2081
00:51:47,901 --> 00:51:50,000
Or how do you get off that fucking
thing where you're sprinting?

2082
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:51,620
You got to grab the edges and hop.

2083
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:53,540
Did you know and I just
started using the other day.

2084
00:51:53,570 --> 00:51:54,590
It's a motherfucker.

2085
00:51:54,591 --> 00:51:55,890
Is that versa climber?

2086
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:56,750
Yeah.

2087
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:58,700
Oh God.

2088
00:51:58,760 --> 00:51:59,593
Damn.

2089
00:51:59,630 --> 00:52:02,060
I've never been on it for
an extended period of time.

2090
00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:03,230
Always in a circuit.

2091
00:52:03,350 --> 00:52:04,520
Oh yeah.

2092
00:52:04,521 --> 00:52:07,190
I did it in a circuit
to the last exercise.

2093
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:07,881
It's miserable.

2094
00:52:07,881 --> 00:52:08,241
I was like,

2095
00:52:08,241 --> 00:52:09,074
motherfucker,

2096
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:12,200
this thing like you do the
first two or three strokes,

2097
00:52:12,201 --> 00:52:14,840
so like I can get through this and
then you're like 10 and you're like,

2098
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:15,920
oh shit.

2099
00:52:15,950 --> 00:52:17,330
You like how much time I got left,

2100
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:19,100
a minute and 10 seconds.

2101
00:52:19,310 --> 00:52:20,570
How's that possible?

2102
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:21,261
I'm like,

2103
00:52:21,261 --> 00:52:23,810
I am not going to make a
minute and 10 seconds of this.

2104
00:52:23,870 --> 00:52:27,170
It feels weird because like
with every stroke it doesn't,

2105
00:52:27,171 --> 00:52:28,004
it doesn't,

2106
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:30,440
it's not heavy or hard to make the stroke.

2107
00:52:30,441 --> 00:52:31,430
It feels like it's nothing.

2108
00:52:31,431 --> 00:52:32,960
But you're also going nowhere,

2109
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:35,983
just like you have,

2110
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:38,360
you're making this
motion and I don't know,

2111
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:39,680
read the shit.

2112
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:40,281
You know,

2113
00:52:40,281 --> 00:52:41,360
you're like down here like this.

2114
00:52:41,361 --> 00:52:41,850
Like how much?

2115
00:52:41,850 --> 00:52:43,430
Like how is that possible?

2116
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:45,290
I've only been doing this for 15 seconds.

2117
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:47,000
I get what I like that.

2118
00:52:47,001 --> 00:52:47,750
And um,

2119
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:51,350
there's a thing called the echo bike
that rogue makes that I have out here.

2120
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:52,490
Holy Shit,

2121
00:52:52,491 --> 00:52:56,180
it's an air dyne but it's like
an airdyne built for gorillas.

2122
00:52:56,390 --> 00:52:59,360
Like if you're gonna put an air dime
machine into fucking gorilla cage,

2123
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:00,740
you'd would make like this robot,

2124
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:03,980
it's like thick ass fucking steal
thing with thick ass handles.

2125
00:53:04,130 --> 00:53:06,440
Everything's like super
beefy and jacked up.

2126
00:53:06,830 --> 00:53:07,641
God Damn,

2127
00:53:07,641 --> 00:53:09,080
that thing kicks you out and show me that.

2128
00:53:09,081 --> 00:53:09,640
I want,

2129
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:09,970
Oh,

2130
00:53:09,970 --> 00:53:10,401
try it.

2131
00:53:10,401 --> 00:53:11,121
It's the Shit,

2132
00:53:11,121 --> 00:53:11,480
man.

2133
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:11,991
It's the shit.

2134
00:53:11,991 --> 00:53:13,160
I do two bottles on that,

2135
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:17,030
so I'll do twenties and tens 20
seconds work ten second break.

2136
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,500
Fuck.

2137
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:20,300
It's fucking hard man.

2138
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:21,740
Those airtime machines look.

2139
00:53:21,741 --> 00:53:23,870
So they look and like nothing.

2140
00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:25,730
That's one of those things
where you look at it,

2141
00:53:25,731 --> 00:53:26,070
you're like how

2142
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:26,910
can that be hard?

2143
00:53:27,330 --> 00:53:27,900
Yeah.

2144
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:28,733
It,

2145
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:30,240
it's hard to,

2146
00:53:30,241 --> 00:53:30,571
when you,

2147
00:53:30,571 --> 00:53:31,470
when you alternate,

2148
00:53:31,890 --> 00:53:32,700
you know what I mean?

2149
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:34,500
So you're riding them both together,

2150
00:53:34,501 --> 00:53:37,350
but you're doing a conditioning workout
and coach is standing right there and

2151
00:53:37,351 --> 00:53:37,680
eat.

2152
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:40,200
You take your feet off of the panels
and you're pumping with your arms.

2153
00:53:40,570 --> 00:53:41,490
That's miserable.

2154
00:53:41,850 --> 00:53:42,750
Miserable as fuck.

2155
00:53:43,570 --> 00:53:44,670
And I also don't,

2156
00:53:45,630 --> 00:53:46,710
not that I don't like it,

2157
00:53:46,711 --> 00:53:48,570
but one of the in the
conditioning workouts,

2158
00:53:48,571 --> 00:53:51,910
the parts that were so hard and
then kind of draining that I'm,

2159
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:52,860
I don't know what you call it,

2160
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:54,720
but it's with the hydraulic presses.

2161
00:53:55,410 --> 00:54:00,410
Oh that's miserable too because every
direction there's no rest on that machine.

2162
00:54:01,290 --> 00:54:02,123
There's none.

2163
00:54:02,430 --> 00:54:05,310
It's kind of crazy when you go back and
look at like old school strength and

2164
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:08,610
conditioning workouts at
fighters used to do and you know,

2165
00:54:08,611 --> 00:54:11,160
comparison to what all the
crazy shit that guys do today.

2166
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:12,660
Who,

2167
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:13,493
which,

2168
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:14,580
which camp?

2169
00:54:15,350 --> 00:54:16,440
Well it's an argument,

2170
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:18,450
but which camps?

2171
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:20,190
I'll go camp cause I
feel like there's two,

2172
00:54:20,191 --> 00:54:22,650
which camps really started that,

2173
00:54:22,651 --> 00:54:22,921
that,

2174
00:54:22,921 --> 00:54:24,630
that the conditioning thing.

2175
00:54:24,631 --> 00:54:25,740
Who are ahead of the game?

2176
00:54:25,770 --> 00:54:27,000
I was thinking of Att,

2177
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:30,720
I always think of them cause they were
like when Lambert created that place,

2178
00:54:30,721 --> 00:54:31,440
Dan Lambert,

2179
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:32,310
the fucking man,

2180
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:33,330
that guy,

2181
00:54:33,330 --> 00:54:36,780
that guy has done a lot for MMA and
he doesn't get his horn blown enough.

2182
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:37,500
Yeah.

2183
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:38,333
He had to respect,

2184
00:54:39,030 --> 00:54:39,750
uh,

2185
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:40,590
he uh,

2186
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:44,190
he put a shit ton of money and an American
top team and one of the things that

2187
00:54:44,191 --> 00:54:46,530
they did about it was make it a full,

2188
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:48,300
like they have everything.

2189
00:54:48,330 --> 00:54:50,310
They have great wrestling coaches,

2190
00:54:50,311 --> 00:54:51,370
great striking coaches,

2191
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:52,081
great Jujitsu,

2192
00:54:52,081 --> 00:54:53,010
huge facility,

2193
00:54:53,011 --> 00:54:54,360
everything state of the art.

2194
00:54:54,690 --> 00:54:59,640
And I was felt like those guys were
out of very high level early on.

2195
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:04,820
Like I remember Tiago Alvarez was
making weight this back when like Tiago

2196
00:55:05,790 --> 00:55:06,300
Alvarez Garrell law.

2197
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:08,040
Remember how big he was at one 70.

2198
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:11,370
And man when he fought Matt Hughes and
he didn't make the weight and he looked

2199
00:55:11,371 --> 00:55:12,930
like he weighed about 400 pounds.

2200
00:55:13,350 --> 00:55:14,850
He didn't even look like a human man.

2201
00:55:14,851 --> 00:55:15,930
He was so jacked.

2202
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:17,213
Well,

2203
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:20,730
he was making weight once and
it was a fight that they did.

2204
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,860
I think it was at the hard rock.

2205
00:55:23,910 --> 00:55:24,743
I don't remember.

2206
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:25,410
Um,

2207
00:55:25,410 --> 00:55:27,060
but it was somewhere where they had,

2208
00:55:27,061 --> 00:55:30,150
maybe it was at the palms somewhere
where they had like the smaller ring,

2209
00:55:30,151 --> 00:55:30,601
I think,

2210
00:55:30,601 --> 00:55:31,710
I don't know why I remember this,

2211
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:36,920
but what I remember was he was
warming up for that day's fight.

2212
00:55:37,270 --> 00:55:37,710
Um,

2213
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:40,200
he had made weight and then,

2214
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:40,710
um,

2215
00:55:40,710 --> 00:55:45,710
after making weight they had a workout
that they would do to put weight back on

2216
00:55:46,111 --> 00:55:46,830
him.

2217
00:55:46,830 --> 00:55:49,500
And one of the things that they
would do was really burned him out.

2218
00:55:49,950 --> 00:55:51,090
So they had him,

2219
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:52,410
he was in the gym.

2220
00:55:52,650 --> 00:55:53,520
I wish he was here.

2221
00:55:53,521 --> 00:55:55,090
I could ask him exactly what this was.

2222
00:55:55,091 --> 00:56:00,091
Cause I'm talking many years ago and
he goes through this really hard pad

2223
00:56:00,230 --> 00:56:01,160
workouts like that.

2224
00:56:01,230 --> 00:56:01,710
Bam,

2225
00:56:01,710 --> 00:56:01,911
Bam.

2226
00:56:01,911 --> 00:56:03,480
I got Bam Bam.

2227
00:56:03,690 --> 00:56:05,460
And there they were
saying they wanted a pump,

2228
00:56:05,461 --> 00:56:09,510
everything up full of blood and then
they fill them up with carbs and it would

2229
00:56:09,511 --> 00:56:10,344
just,

2230
00:56:10,590 --> 00:56:11,970
everything would blow back up.

2231
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:16,380
So like the muscles get super dehydrated
cause he's draining himself out big

2232
00:56:16,381 --> 00:56:17,040
time.

2233
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:17,281
You know,

2234
00:56:17,281 --> 00:56:19,870
he was walking around north of 200 pounds,

2235
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:24,040
cutting down to one 70 and
then after the weight cut

2236
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:25,990
they would swell them back up again.

2237
00:56:25,991 --> 00:56:29,740
So he got to put 30 pounds
back on them in 24 hours.

2238
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:34,720
And that was one of the methods that
they used was exercise followed by fuel.

2239
00:56:36,610 --> 00:56:38,230
I guess a,

2240
00:56:38,310 --> 00:56:41,590
it kind of makes sense and it also
confuses me because it confused me too

2241
00:56:41,591 --> 00:56:44,010
because I'm a dummy and I was
listening to him talking about this.

2242
00:56:44,030 --> 00:56:44,291
I was like,

2243
00:56:44,291 --> 00:56:44,801
okay,

2244
00:56:44,801 --> 00:56:45,041
okay,

2245
00:56:45,041 --> 00:56:46,660
why is this like what's happening?

2246
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:47,703
How are you doing this?

2247
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:51,270
I get the principle that you're
saying but what's the science behind?

2248
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:51,480
Right.

2249
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:52,360
Cause that's where I'm at.

2250
00:56:52,810 --> 00:56:53,291
Science.

2251
00:56:53,291 --> 00:56:56,740
He looks like a gorilla when he fights
and he really put that weight back on.

2252
00:56:56,741 --> 00:57:01,741
Well and they had glace in and nobody
is bigger at one 55 in glace and t bow.

2253
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:02,480
Yeah,

2254
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:03,161
glaze and tee ball.

2255
00:57:03,161 --> 00:57:04,630
It looks like a fucking light heavyweight.

2256
00:57:05,170 --> 00:57:09,070
He's so big and somehow or another it
makes it down to 55 like when he gets on

2257
00:57:09,071 --> 00:57:10,520
the scale it's like you're,

2258
00:57:10,990 --> 00:57:12,100
it's like Yoel Romero.

2259
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:13,200
When he gets on the scary,

2260
00:57:13,201 --> 00:57:13,660
you're like,

2261
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:14,140
okay,

2262
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:16,390
am I seeing something wrong?

2263
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:19,730
Like how has that one
85 how's that possible?

2264
00:57:19,731 --> 00:57:20,080
Yeah,

2265
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:20,861
it doesn't make sense.

2266
00:57:20,861 --> 00:57:22,240
Like I'm watching him weigh in.

2267
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:26,530
He is one 85 the guy says one
85 he steps off and you're like,

2268
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:28,120
what in the fuck am I seeing?

2269
00:57:28,270 --> 00:57:29,103
How's that possible?

2270
00:57:29,330 --> 00:57:30,150
I get that.

2271
00:57:30,150 --> 00:57:31,070
Like good t bow.

2272
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:35,200
I've been in the locker room with tee
ball a couple of times at att and m but a

2273
00:57:35,201 --> 00:57:35,590
t ball.

2274
00:57:35,590 --> 00:57:36,520
What are you weighing in right now,

2275
00:57:36,521 --> 00:57:36,710
man?

2276
00:57:36,710 --> 00:57:37,150
He's like,

2277
00:57:37,150 --> 00:57:38,080
oh my friend.

2278
00:57:38,081 --> 00:57:40,360
Like one 90 I'm like,

2279
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:42,190
you know one nine to get on the scale.

2280
00:57:42,410 --> 00:57:42,860
No,

2281
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:43,520
no.

2282
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:44,590
He don't want to get on the scale.

2283
00:57:44,591 --> 00:57:48,170
I'm guarantee use like two 10
get out of here that one night.

2284
00:57:48,171 --> 00:57:49,030
He's so big.

2285
00:57:49,031 --> 00:57:49,841
He's huge.

2286
00:57:49,841 --> 00:57:50,710
He's so big.

2287
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:52,720
Oh look how big he is.

2288
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:53,350
Look at them.

2289
00:57:53,350 --> 00:57:53,990
Fucking sad.

2290
00:57:53,990 --> 00:57:55,600
I got 155 pounder.

2291
00:57:55,610 --> 00:57:58,840
Look at the size of him
and eco five eight five,

2292
00:57:58,841 --> 00:57:59,650
nine yeah.

2293
00:57:59,650 --> 00:58:01,630
Built like a tank.

2294
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,190
He's so big.

2295
00:58:03,191 --> 00:58:03,390
Do you?

2296
00:58:03,390 --> 00:58:04,300
Silly strong dude.

2297
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:08,360
He's the most diesel guide that
I've ever seen at one 55 like it,

2298
00:58:08,370 --> 00:58:10,700
that is about as thick as it means.

2299
00:58:10,770 --> 00:58:12,160
There's no room for error there.

2300
00:58:12,810 --> 00:58:14,050
And he made wait a lot.

2301
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:14,500
Yeah.

2302
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:15,550
I mean he might've missed it.

2303
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,410
He missed it like once or twice,

2304
00:58:17,411 --> 00:58:19,720
but he made most of the
time t bow made weight.

2305
00:58:19,721 --> 00:58:19,901
He,

2306
00:58:19,901 --> 00:58:21,070
it was miserable for him.

2307
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:21,581
Well,

2308
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:23,950
go back to that one picture
that you just showed.

2309
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:24,191
Oh,

2310
00:58:24,191 --> 00:58:24,800
it's him.

2311
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:26,050
A fighting somebody.

2312
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:26,311
No,

2313
00:58:26,311 --> 00:58:26,481
no,

2314
00:58:26,481 --> 00:58:26,631
no.

2315
00:58:26,631 --> 00:58:27,464
That one right there.

2316
00:58:29,770 --> 00:58:30,550
That's um,

2317
00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:31,383
track door.

2318
00:58:31,570 --> 00:58:32,380
Yeah.

2319
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:32,591
No,

2320
00:58:32,591 --> 00:58:33,320
not track door.

2321
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:33,530
No,

2322
00:58:33,530 --> 00:58:33,760
no,

2323
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:34,593
no.

2324
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:35,583
Um,

2325
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:36,933
oh God.

2326
00:58:37,450 --> 00:58:39,880
Why can't I know who you're talking about?

2327
00:58:39,881 --> 00:58:41,650
Brazilian cat Massell room.

2328
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:42,930
What's his crazy and Doula?

2329
00:58:42,970 --> 00:58:43,181
Yeah.

2330
00:58:43,181 --> 00:58:44,620
What does that crazy nickname?

2331
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:45,390
No,

2332
00:58:45,390 --> 00:58:45,940
God damn.

2333
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:46,900
Why can't remember his name?

2334
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:47,893
Same here.

2335
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:48,780
Turn Aldo.

2336
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:49,780
Turn all the functionality.

2337
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:50,653
Yeah.

2338
00:58:50,930 --> 00:58:53,350
Toronado far 85 move.

2339
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:54,430
Say Brazil.

2340
00:58:54,670 --> 00:58:58,120
Did he fight 85 [inaudible]
80 [inaudible] 85 I believe.

2341
00:58:58,121 --> 00:59:02,250
I know he fought Nick
Diaz also at 72 crazy.

2342
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:03,040
I feel like,

2343
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:03,641
I don't know if you,

2344
00:59:03,641 --> 00:59:05,110
I fought in the UFC at 85 though.

2345
00:59:05,530 --> 00:59:05,711
No,

2346
00:59:05,711 --> 00:59:06,470
I don't think you did it.

2347
00:59:06,470 --> 00:59:07,303
Yeah.

2348
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:09,730
But when you were saying that thing about,

2349
00:59:09,731 --> 00:59:10,564
um,

2350
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:12,610
when you said about
what you said about att,

2351
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:14,201
I agree,

2352
00:59:14,201 --> 00:59:16,690
but I mean even further back than that,

2353
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:17,970
the earliest guys,

2354
00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:21,680
frank shamrock was one of the writing
shamrock and then the middle and military,

2355
00:59:22,420 --> 00:59:24,950
those share mark was the guy
really figured out conditioning.

2356
00:59:24,950 --> 00:59:25,460
Yeah.

2357
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:26,390
That's how he beat Tito.

2358
00:59:26,430 --> 00:59:27,110
Yeah.

2359
00:59:27,110 --> 00:59:27,321
Yeah,

2360
00:59:27,321 --> 00:59:27,651
for sure.

2361
00:59:27,651 --> 00:59:28,970
He was so small in that fight.

2362
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:29,810
He was tiny.

2363
00:59:29,810 --> 00:59:33,320
He was like one 95 and
Tito was a goal ruler.

2364
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:35,150
He was a big fella.

2365
00:59:35,210 --> 00:59:36,043
Yeah.

2366
00:59:36,150 --> 00:59:37,100
War is out south.

2367
00:59:37,101 --> 00:59:39,230
That was when the weight
class was 200 pounds to the,

2368
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:39,471
yeah,

2369
00:59:39,471 --> 00:59:40,700
you had to make one 99.

2370
00:59:40,701 --> 00:59:41,540
Yeah.

2371
00:59:41,570 --> 00:59:41,901
That was,

2372
00:59:41,901 --> 00:59:42,500
uh,

2373
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:43,460
the early days,

2374
00:59:43,461 --> 00:59:44,294
you know?

2375
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:44,930
Yeah.

2376
00:59:44,930 --> 00:59:46,610
It was very different back then,

2377
00:59:46,611 --> 00:59:46,911
man.

2378
00:59:46,911 --> 00:59:47,241
I was,

2379
00:59:47,241 --> 00:59:47,540
um,

2380
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:49,910
I was scrolling through
fipass watching the whole,

2381
00:59:49,911 --> 00:59:51,410
like the entire events.

2382
00:59:51,770 --> 00:59:54,020
Then I get down to like
2000 and it gets like,

2383
00:59:54,410 --> 00:59:57,560
you scrolling through and it's like
2017 it has all these events across the

2384
00:59:57,561 --> 00:59:57,801
screen.

2385
00:59:57,801 --> 00:59:59,630
You've got to scroll 16 same thing.

2386
00:59:59,631 --> 01:00:01,580
15 starts going down and you get to 10.

2387
01:00:01,581 --> 01:00:02,960
It's like it's still less,

2388
01:00:02,961 --> 01:00:04,430
but you still got to
crawl across the screen.

2389
01:00:04,431 --> 01:00:05,810
Then you get to like seven,

2390
01:00:05,890 --> 01:00:07,850
you got to like eight and
it's like five events,

2391
01:00:08,330 --> 01:00:08,961
five events,

2392
01:00:08,961 --> 01:00:10,070
five events and that's it.

2393
01:00:10,790 --> 01:00:15,790
You know like [inaudible] I have
21 UFC fights under my belt,

2394
01:00:16,730 --> 01:00:21,730
but there were five UFC is a year back
then it's like now there's like two

2395
01:00:22,221 --> 01:00:23,360
months you get like six,

2396
01:00:23,361 --> 01:00:23,900
seven,

2397
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:24,733
seven cards.

2398
01:00:25,170 --> 01:00:27,520
I just felt like you got fucked and uh,

2399
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:28,460
Josh Thomson,

2400
01:00:28,461 --> 01:00:32,720
a lot of guys in your era because they
cut out the 55 pound division for a long

2401
01:00:32,721 --> 01:00:36,140
time and then you went out and
fought up Bodog and all these other

2402
01:00:36,141 --> 01:00:36,974
organizations.

2403
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:39,230
There was no 55 for how many years?

2404
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:41,441
Um,

2405
01:00:41,441 --> 01:00:42,200
my shoe.

2406
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:42,591
Yeah,

2407
01:00:42,591 --> 01:00:45,680
like 2004 to 2000.

2408
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:47,990
2005 to like 2010 for sure.

2409
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:49,730
They didn't come back until,

2410
01:00:49,790 --> 01:00:50,360
um,

2411
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:51,260
the ultimate fighter.

2412
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:51,621
Yeah,

2413
01:00:51,621 --> 01:00:55,010
like that's when Gilbert
and Josh Thompson,

2414
01:00:55,011 --> 01:00:57,560
we're having those epic
war's over in strike force.

2415
01:00:57,980 --> 01:00:59,540
So like those years,

2416
01:00:59,541 --> 01:01:04,541
like there was those guys like you
Thompson and I feel like Gilbert Gilbert

2417
01:01:05,691 --> 01:01:08,870
staked his claim in the UFC and
had some epic fights in the UFC.

2418
01:01:08,870 --> 01:01:13,520
But I honestly don't think we see the
same Gilbert that we saw in strike force.

2419
01:01:13,521 --> 01:01:13,791
Yeah,

2420
01:01:13,791 --> 01:01:14,260
no,

2421
01:01:14,260 --> 01:01:14,750
we,

2422
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:15,583
no one,

2423
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:19,970
no one can say better than you because
you've been in there that how much those

2424
01:01:19,971 --> 01:01:22,040
wars we'll just take out of you.

2425
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:23,690
They will.

2426
01:01:23,690 --> 01:01:24,510
And a guy like,

2427
01:01:24,510 --> 01:01:27,740
like the wars that Gilbert and
Josh went through it strike force.

2428
01:01:28,070 --> 01:01:29,540
And then Gilbert is that kind of guy.

2429
01:01:29,541 --> 01:01:32,480
He's just like his fight with the eagles.

2430
01:01:33,050 --> 01:01:33,561
That's it.

2431
01:01:33,561 --> 01:01:34,160
They're not,

2432
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:35,390
they're not backing down.

2433
01:01:35,660 --> 01:01:35,961
And,

2434
01:01:35,961 --> 01:01:36,140
um,

2435
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:37,430
they got the chance to take it.

2436
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:38,061
You know,

2437
01:01:38,061 --> 01:01:38,661
there's not,

2438
01:01:38,661 --> 01:01:40,220
there's not a lot of guys that can,

2439
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:41,360
that can take it like that.

2440
01:01:41,690 --> 01:01:42,200
Um,

2441
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:44,160
I haven't been in a lot of wars that,

2442
01:01:44,210 --> 01:01:45,410
that we're back and forth.

2443
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:45,921
Even if the,

2444
01:01:45,921 --> 01:01:47,330
if the fight had some attrition,

2445
01:01:47,510 --> 01:01:48,830
there was a lot of times it was,

2446
01:01:48,831 --> 01:01:49,340
um,

2447
01:01:49,340 --> 01:01:53,180
I was winning the striking battle and
it wasn't taking as many shots as those

2448
01:01:53,181 --> 01:01:54,050
guys have taken.

2449
01:01:54,620 --> 01:01:55,310
Um,

2450
01:01:55,310 --> 01:01:55,671
and they,

2451
01:01:55,671 --> 01:01:56,960
you have to have a chin to do that,

2452
01:01:57,920 --> 01:01:58,753
man.

2453
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:03,410
Like I couldn't imagine to
this day having been in having,

2454
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:07,040
I have like my record shows
like 60 something fights.

2455
01:02:07,070 --> 01:02:10,400
I have like 80 plus fights overall.

2456
01:02:10,730 --> 01:02:11,800
And I still like,

2457
01:02:11,810 --> 01:02:15,020
I look at some of those fights like
Diego and Gilbert and I'm like,

2458
01:02:15,110 --> 01:02:15,943
man,

2459
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:18,500
I'm so glad that Joe,

2460
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:20,100
I remember as a kid I was

2461
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:23,370
laying on my couch watching Vernon
white and pancreas and I'm laying there

2462
01:02:23,371 --> 01:02:25,140
watching and he's getting his ass beat.

2463
01:02:26,020 --> 01:02:28,280
Then it gets to the third
round and he turns it around,

2464
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:29,310
knocks the guy out,

2465
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:29,880
right?

2466
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:30,450
And I'm like,

2467
01:02:30,450 --> 01:02:31,470
I roll off of the cows,

2468
01:02:31,471 --> 01:02:32,430
I get on my knees and I'm like,

2469
01:02:32,610 --> 01:02:32,941
God,

2470
01:02:32,941 --> 01:02:34,280
please let me have fights like that.

2471
01:02:34,281 --> 01:02:35,370
That was the kind of fights that went up.

2472
01:02:35,371 --> 01:02:35,641
Please,

2473
01:02:35,641 --> 01:02:35,900
please,

2474
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:36,091
please.

2475
01:02:36,091 --> 01:02:37,230
I'm like the young kid,

2476
01:02:37,231 --> 01:02:37,411
you know,

2477
01:02:37,411 --> 01:02:37,780
I just,

2478
01:02:37,780 --> 01:02:38,611
I want to do that.

2479
01:02:38,611 --> 01:02:40,410
I want to have epic fights like that.

2480
01:02:40,411 --> 01:02:41,010
Right.

2481
01:02:41,010 --> 01:02:43,080
But now that I'm done and
I'm looking back at it,

2482
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:46,370
like there are times I watched that
stout fight and when I get hit,

2483
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:46,921
I'm just like,

2484
01:02:46,921 --> 01:02:47,370
oh,

2485
01:02:47,370 --> 01:02:47,641
it was,

2486
01:02:47,641 --> 01:02:47,810
it's,

2487
01:02:47,810 --> 01:02:48,271
it's still,

2488
01:02:48,271 --> 01:02:48,811
it hurts.

2489
01:02:48,811 --> 01:02:49,830
It didn't hurt then,

2490
01:02:50,130 --> 01:02:50,461
but like,

2491
01:02:50,461 --> 01:02:51,270
it hurts now.

2492
01:02:51,270 --> 01:02:53,670
Like I feel like a slight
physical pain from it.

2493
01:02:53,670 --> 01:02:54,990
Not like it breaks my heart.

2494
01:02:54,991 --> 01:02:55,290
It's,

2495
01:02:55,290 --> 01:02:55,711
yeah,

2496
01:02:55,711 --> 01:02:57,060
that part will always hurt.

2497
01:02:57,300 --> 01:02:57,751
But I mean,

2498
01:02:57,751 --> 01:02:57,931
like,

2499
01:02:57,931 --> 01:02:59,280
that looks brutal.

2500
01:02:59,580 --> 01:03:00,181
It's painful.

2501
01:03:00,181 --> 01:03:01,014
It's not,

2502
01:03:01,470 --> 01:03:02,760
but it looks that way.

2503
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:03,511
But you know,

2504
01:03:03,511 --> 01:03:05,150
those fights with Gilbert and,

2505
01:03:05,151 --> 01:03:05,310
and,

2506
01:03:05,310 --> 01:03:06,560
and like Gilbert and,

2507
01:03:06,561 --> 01:03:08,730
and Diego,

2508
01:03:09,150 --> 01:03:10,080
when they're still in it,

2509
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:11,033
that shit hurts.

2510
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:12,541
Well,

2511
01:03:12,541 --> 01:03:14,310
Gilbert didn't have to
fight them that way.

2512
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:15,480
That's why it was so crazy.

2513
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:16,120
It's a,

2514
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:19,590
Gilbert decided to use his skills
and find a technical fight.

2515
01:03:19,830 --> 01:03:20,970
He would have been,

2516
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:21,710
you know,

2517
01:03:21,710 --> 01:03:21,900
he,

2518
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:25,230
he was the better fighter
technically at the time,

2519
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:26,610
but he just said,

2520
01:03:26,611 --> 01:03:27,030
fuck it.

2521
01:03:27,030 --> 01:03:27,863
Let's go to war.

2522
01:03:28,050 --> 01:03:28,530
You know?

2523
01:03:28,530 --> 01:03:29,190
Yeah.

2524
01:03:29,190 --> 01:03:30,760
I mean,

2525
01:03:30,761 --> 01:03:32,700
there's just not a whole lot of
people that are willing to do that.

2526
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:33,060
Yeah.

2527
01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:33,301
That,

2528
01:03:33,301 --> 01:03:34,770
that I think that's what it is.

2529
01:03:34,860 --> 01:03:35,460
Um,

2530
01:03:35,460 --> 01:03:36,300
like Erin,

2531
01:03:36,330 --> 01:03:37,770
like my fight with Erin Riley,

2532
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:38,933
um,

2533
01:03:39,210 --> 01:03:42,450
I was able to figure him out
and I could pick him apart.

2534
01:03:42,450 --> 01:03:45,030
So at Aaron is the kind of guy
who would go to war with you.

2535
01:03:45,470 --> 01:03:47,460
Like if I figured you out,

2536
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:49,080
I'm not going to go like this.

2537
01:03:49,290 --> 01:03:50,520
I'm not giving you a chance.

2538
01:03:50,521 --> 01:03:51,330
Fuck you.

2539
01:03:51,330 --> 01:03:51,511
Right.

2540
01:03:51,511 --> 01:03:51,750
You know,

2541
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:56,370
that's why I don't have to prove to
anybody else how much of Man I am.

2542
01:03:56,610 --> 01:03:58,260
And on the other side of that,

2543
01:03:58,490 --> 01:03:59,490
I don't like getting hit.

2544
01:03:59,850 --> 01:04:01,020
That shit's nonsense.

2545
01:04:01,021 --> 01:04:03,570
That prove how much of a
man you are by getting hit.

2546
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,070
That's nonsense.

2547
01:04:05,071 --> 01:04:09,090
I like when guys like Gilbert
choose to go crazy and go to war,

2548
01:04:09,510 --> 01:04:11,220
but that's on him.

2549
01:04:11,340 --> 01:04:12,390
That's because he wants to,

2550
01:04:12,450 --> 01:04:13,283
that is on him.

2551
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:13,990
But you know,

2552
01:04:13,990 --> 01:04:18,030
like there's a guy who did something like
that and he was willing to go to war,

2553
01:04:18,090 --> 01:04:19,140
but you can see he,

2554
01:04:19,141 --> 01:04:21,420
he still kept his technique
when he went to war.

2555
01:04:21,630 --> 01:04:24,030
And I'm talking about
Max Holloway when he,

2556
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:24,331
when he,

2557
01:04:24,331 --> 01:04:27,600
when he with I'm Ricardo Lamas when
he's like right here right now.

2558
01:04:27,870 --> 01:04:29,040
He started trading,

2559
01:04:29,220 --> 01:04:31,140
but he wasn't just sitting
in the pocket trading.

2560
01:04:31,141 --> 01:04:32,220
He was throwing his,

2561
01:04:32,250 --> 01:04:32,911
getting out,

2562
01:04:32,911 --> 01:04:33,571
coming back,

2563
01:04:33,571 --> 01:04:34,980
getting up and getting out.

2564
01:04:35,430 --> 01:04:36,480
That's how you do that.

2565
01:04:36,910 --> 01:04:37,140
You know,

2566
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:38,400
you don't just sit there and go,

2567
01:04:38,401 --> 01:04:38,701
okay,

2568
01:04:38,701 --> 01:04:39,421
I got mine now.

2569
01:04:39,421 --> 01:04:40,570
You get yours now.

2570
01:04:40,690 --> 01:04:43,140
Just bite down on that
mouthpiece in wing punches.

2571
01:04:43,210 --> 01:04:44,043
Yeah,

2572
01:04:44,490 --> 01:04:48,750
I mean that's Diego Specialty Diego's
the best blood and guts fighter ever.

2573
01:04:49,050 --> 01:04:49,350
I mean,

2574
01:04:49,350 --> 01:04:51,660
every single fight he's ever had,

2575
01:04:51,661 --> 01:04:52,440
his blood and guts.

2576
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:55,620
I would go back to his fight with Martin
Kampmann lost the first two rounds.

2577
01:04:55,621 --> 01:05:00,150
He's got his face hanging off like
literally like a Zombie and he's chasing

2578
01:05:00,151 --> 01:05:02,130
after Martin Cameron and
he wins a third round.

2579
01:05:02,430 --> 01:05:03,420
When's the third round against?

2580
01:05:03,421 --> 01:05:06,030
Ellenberger is fighting
Ellenberger who was at the time,

2581
01:05:06,031 --> 01:05:06,480
you know,

2582
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:07,231
a strong,

2583
01:05:07,231 --> 01:05:08,070
powerful one.

2584
01:05:08,071 --> 01:05:09,840
70 big punches.

2585
01:05:09,870 --> 01:05:12,330
Diego's got his back and the
third round he's beating him up.

2586
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:15,660
I mean that's just blood and guts.

2587
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:17,890
That guy's got more blood and guts.

2588
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:22,390
Then virtually a like 99% of the
population of the planet earth.

2589
01:05:22,870 --> 01:05:27,310
Diego is one of those guys too
that he's a scary individual.

2590
01:05:27,311 --> 01:05:27,521
When you,

2591
01:05:27,521 --> 01:05:28,660
when you look at him as like,

2592
01:05:28,690 --> 01:05:30,130
okay that's a potential opponent,

2593
01:05:30,131 --> 01:05:31,180
especially in his prime,

2594
01:05:31,690 --> 01:05:35,290
but away from that he
likes now he's a really,

2595
01:05:35,291 --> 01:05:36,190
especially now.

2596
01:05:36,430 --> 01:05:37,263
And I was um,

2597
01:05:37,810 --> 01:05:38,800
when he fought rigs

2598
01:05:40,330 --> 01:05:41,200
like I felt,

2599
01:05:41,201 --> 01:05:42,034
I feel like

2600
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:45,370
those two kinds of personalities,

2601
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:48,400
they're just going to be like
added at each other all the time.

2602
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:51,520
And you feel like that's how
they're going to be always.

2603
01:05:51,521 --> 01:05:52,600
But like a guy like Diego,

2604
01:05:52,601 --> 01:05:53,600
like look at what he's doing with,

2605
01:05:53,601 --> 01:05:53,910
with,

2606
01:05:53,910 --> 01:05:54,850
with the guys in,

2607
01:05:54,851 --> 01:05:55,980
in Albuquerque is hell,

2608
01:05:55,990 --> 01:05:57,070
I forget the guy's name,

2609
01:05:57,071 --> 01:05:59,830
but he's helping out that guy
that he has a big UFC fan,

2610
01:05:59,860 --> 01:06:00,581
the down syndrome,

2611
01:06:00,581 --> 01:06:01,414
down syndrome.

2612
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:02,583
I don't remember how old.

2613
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:03,490
That's amazing.

2614
01:06:03,490 --> 01:06:04,090
But like,

2615
01:06:04,090 --> 01:06:04,571
like he's,

2616
01:06:04,571 --> 01:06:05,740
he's committed to this.

2617
01:06:05,741 --> 01:06:06,221
It's not like,

2618
01:06:06,221 --> 01:06:07,054
it's not like,

2619
01:06:07,060 --> 01:06:07,893
and it's not like,

2620
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:08,741
hey check me out.

2621
01:06:08,741 --> 01:06:09,130
I'm doing,

2622
01:06:09,130 --> 01:06:09,963
you know what I mean?

2623
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:10,990
All the time.

2624
01:06:10,990 --> 01:06:12,550
Like he was with the guy all the time.

2625
01:06:12,850 --> 01:06:14,320
I like Diego Man.

2626
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:15,370
He's a good dude.

2627
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:16,390
He's a very good dude.

2628
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:16,811
Yeah.

2629
01:06:16,811 --> 01:06:18,070
That Rick's fight was crazy too.

2630
01:06:18,071 --> 01:06:21,220
Cause rigs never thought the
Diego's got Kale stepping in.

2631
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:21,610
Kayla.

2632
01:06:21,610 --> 01:06:23,840
And when the right hook
like early in the fight too,

2633
01:06:23,841 --> 01:06:24,430
it was like,

2634
01:06:24,430 --> 01:06:26,710
and rigs is one of those guys that see,

2635
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:31,800
I don't think that he ever totally showed
in the octagon what he was capable of

2636
01:06:33,071 --> 01:06:33,904
in the gym.

2637
01:06:33,970 --> 01:06:37,090
And he also has a guard that peaked
during like the kind of like the rich

2638
01:06:37,091 --> 01:06:38,050
Franklin Arrow.

2639
01:06:38,140 --> 01:06:38,770
You know,

2640
01:06:38,770 --> 01:06:40,150
like when he fought Matt Hughes,

2641
01:06:40,151 --> 01:06:41,050
didn't he miss wait,

2642
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:42,220
when he fought for the title,

2643
01:06:42,770 --> 01:06:43,750
Mr weighed against mad.

2644
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:44,291
He was mad.

2645
01:06:44,291 --> 01:06:46,000
He was Kimora Adam and,

2646
01:06:46,030 --> 01:06:46,261
but the,

2647
01:06:46,261 --> 01:06:51,261
what are the always heard is that Joe
rigs in the gym was a world beater.

2648
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:53,560
Like people would spar with
them and they'd be like,

2649
01:06:53,561 --> 01:06:54,610
Holy Shit.

2650
01:06:54,611 --> 01:06:56,260
Like Joe rigs are world champion.

2651
01:06:56,500 --> 01:07:00,580
Like he's that good and that he would
be Dustin up all these like really high

2652
01:07:00,581 --> 01:07:01,750
level guys in the gym.

2653
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:02,621
There's,

2654
01:07:02,621 --> 01:07:05,350
there's something though about
being in the gym and you know,

2655
01:07:05,351 --> 01:07:06,370
you know this button.

2656
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:10,270
The thing that about being in the
gym versus being inside the Octagon.

2657
01:07:11,190 --> 01:07:12,023
Um,

2658
01:07:12,340 --> 01:07:15,160
it's that the stakes are a real now,

2659
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:16,360
like in the gym,

2660
01:07:17,290 --> 01:07:21,430
a lot of guys will open up more
because you can't really lose there.

2661
01:07:21,550 --> 01:07:22,383
You can't,

2662
01:07:22,390 --> 01:07:22,840
you know,

2663
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:24,760
but when you're in the fight itself,

2664
01:07:25,330 --> 01:07:25,661
you,

2665
01:07:25,661 --> 01:07:26,494
um,

2666
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:27,371
you,

2667
01:07:27,371 --> 01:07:28,204
you kind of,

2668
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:30,720
you don't want to pull all
the triggers because if,

2669
01:07:30,730 --> 01:07:32,560
if this bullet misses right,

2670
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:33,221
I'm exposed,

2671
01:07:33,221 --> 01:07:34,450
I got no defense to that.

2672
01:07:34,570 --> 01:07:35,291
So you're not,

2673
01:07:35,291 --> 01:07:39,160
you're not putting everything on the table
that you would in the gym because the

2674
01:07:39,161 --> 01:07:41,200
risk is so much greater.

2675
01:07:41,290 --> 01:07:42,500
And I think that's where,

2676
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:44,470
where are the guys who can perform,

2677
01:07:44,471 --> 01:07:45,880
who step up to the game?

2678
01:07:46,330 --> 01:07:49,900
I believe that's the aspect
that they have to their game,

2679
01:07:49,901 --> 01:07:52,570
that that's missing from some of these
guys who were world beaters in the gym.

2680
01:07:52,571 --> 01:07:53,351
But when they did it,

2681
01:07:53,351 --> 01:07:54,640
they just can't bring it to the field.

2682
01:07:55,090 --> 01:07:56,500
It's a mental strength for sure.

2683
01:07:56,890 --> 01:07:59,670
And it's a confidence
and your technique and,

2684
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:00,513
and the,

2685
01:08:00,670 --> 01:08:01,503
the outcome.

2686
01:08:01,570 --> 01:08:03,550
Some people think that
the world's against him.

2687
01:08:03,850 --> 01:08:04,350
You know,

2688
01:08:04,350 --> 01:08:06,100
there's an attitude that some people have.

2689
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:07,660
Icon never works out for me.

2690
01:08:07,670 --> 01:08:08,800
A fucking no more.

2691
01:08:08,801 --> 01:08:10,060
I can't catch a break off.

2692
01:08:10,330 --> 01:08:10,721
But it's,

2693
01:08:10,721 --> 01:08:14,200
it's interesting because those are the
guys that can't catch a break and you

2694
01:08:14,201 --> 01:08:15,034
always wonder,

2695
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:16,310
he always wonder

2696
01:08:16,310 --> 01:08:17,061
what came first,

2697
01:08:17,061 --> 01:08:17,841
the chicken or the egg.

2698
01:08:17,841 --> 01:08:22,841
Is it the attitude that is making their
life this impossible puzzle to solve or

2699
01:08:25,011 --> 01:08:25,970
is it they just got,

2700
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,630
they just keep getting shitty rolls of
the dice are think it's the attitude

2701
01:08:29,631 --> 01:08:30,464
probably.

2702
01:08:30,650 --> 01:08:35,300
It's like it's a snowball effect from
the very first decisions you make real

2703
01:08:35,301 --> 01:08:36,110
early on,

2704
01:08:36,110 --> 01:08:38,600
especially when competing and you're like,

2705
01:08:38,750 --> 01:08:41,180
everybody knows that there's
times where you can quit.

2706
01:08:41,420 --> 01:08:43,520
Everybody knows there's times where you,

2707
01:08:43,580 --> 01:08:43,911
you know,

2708
01:08:43,911 --> 01:08:46,730
you didn't train as hard or you
didn't push as hard or you didn't.

2709
01:08:47,330 --> 01:08:50,480
And some people don't.

2710
01:08:50,900 --> 01:08:54,170
Some people don't learn like
they have those moments.

2711
01:08:54,171 --> 01:08:56,060
Like when you're a
little kid and you know,

2712
01:08:56,061 --> 01:08:58,610
maybe you're wrestling or something
like that and you got scared,

2713
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:00,890
he didn't perform well and
then you go back and go,

2714
01:09:00,891 --> 01:09:01,724
okay,

2715
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:02,713
that sucked.

2716
01:09:02,780 --> 01:09:03,680
I don't want to do that again.

2717
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:06,140
I've got to figure out how to fucking
toughen up or I've got to figure out how

2718
01:09:06,141 --> 01:09:07,550
to just perform.

2719
01:09:07,730 --> 01:09:08,990
And some people just don't date.

2720
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:10,670
Some people just run away from it.

2721
01:09:10,671 --> 01:09:12,980
The runaway never ever
see that thing again.

2722
01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:13,491
Yeah.

2723
01:09:13,491 --> 01:09:18,491
It's like there's the weird little
moments in fights that you could see

2724
01:09:18,741 --> 01:09:20,480
happening where guys are exhausted,

2725
01:09:20,481 --> 01:09:21,560
but they dig down.

2726
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:22,281
You know what,

2727
01:09:22,281 --> 01:09:22,471
fine.

2728
01:09:22,471 --> 01:09:23,860
I always call upon like,

2729
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:27,800
here's a dude who's got
impossible mental strength.

2730
01:09:28,460 --> 01:09:29,540
Darren Elkins,

2731
01:09:30,270 --> 01:09:34,370
Merseyside Tick Merseyside Beck is
lightened him up like a Christmas tree in

2732
01:09:34,371 --> 01:09:35,001
Times Square.

2733
01:09:35,001 --> 01:09:35,271
I mean,

2734
01:09:35,271 --> 01:09:36,530
he's just fucking him up.

2735
01:09:36,830 --> 01:09:38,180
He is on point.

2736
01:09:38,181 --> 01:09:39,950
He looks like a future champion.

2737
01:09:39,951 --> 01:09:41,300
He looks fantastic.

2738
01:09:41,630 --> 01:09:43,610
Darren Elkins won't stop.

2739
01:09:43,940 --> 01:09:45,020
He won't stop.

2740
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:46,250
He keeps going.

2741
01:09:46,550 --> 01:09:47,430
He keeps coming.

2742
01:09:47,630 --> 01:09:49,100
He's absorbing punches,

2743
01:09:49,101 --> 01:09:50,180
he's covered in blood.

2744
01:09:50,181 --> 01:09:54,350
He's getting punched and kicked and
Shand and fucking elbow keeps coming,

2745
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:55,430
keeps coming,

2746
01:09:55,610 --> 01:09:56,443
keeps coming.

2747
01:09:56,740 --> 01:09:57,400
Boom.

2748
01:09:57,400 --> 01:09:58,101
He catches them.

2749
01:09:58,101 --> 01:09:59,510
You see backtick Waba and you're like,

2750
01:09:59,540 --> 01:10:00,740
oh no.

2751
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:01,491
Boom,

2752
01:10:01,491 --> 01:10:02,151
head kick.

2753
01:10:02,151 --> 01:10:03,500
Like what the fuck?

2754
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:07,130
Darren Elkins is pounded them out and
then the referee stops the fight and then

2755
01:10:07,220 --> 01:10:08,500
can steps off of them is like,

2756
01:10:10,100 --> 01:10:13,190
it's like God damn I that is,

2757
01:10:13,220 --> 01:10:16,790
that is the reward for having
indomitable spirit like that.

2758
01:10:17,060 --> 01:10:17,680
That is a,

2759
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:22,680
the kind of victory cry that you only get
when you went through hell and you did

2760
01:10:23,061 --> 01:10:23,920
not give up.

2761
01:10:24,030 --> 01:10:24,480
Yeah.

2762
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:24,781
That,

2763
01:10:24,781 --> 01:10:27,030
that fight itself after the second,

2764
01:10:27,031 --> 01:10:28,830
I believe it was you just like,

2765
01:10:28,950 --> 01:10:29,731
this is like,

2766
01:10:29,731 --> 01:10:30,564
they should be stopped.

2767
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:31,380
Right.

2768
01:10:31,380 --> 01:10:32,270
This should be stopped.

2769
01:10:32,271 --> 01:10:35,910
He's though there's no chance and I don't
really watch them get beat up as much.

2770
01:10:35,911 --> 01:10:36,181
So,

2771
01:10:36,181 --> 01:10:36,480
um,

2772
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:36,720
um,

2773
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:40,260
like tweeting about the fight and watching
and I'm looking back and forth and

2774
01:10:40,261 --> 01:10:41,220
then holy fuck,

2775
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:42,540
all of a sudden decides upside

2776
01:10:42,620 --> 01:10:43,453
down.

2777
01:10:44,750 --> 01:10:45,620
I love that guy.

2778
01:10:45,621 --> 01:10:47,690
And then Elkins chokes
out Michael Johnson.

2779
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:49,340
Man shows people he's got skills.

2780
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:49,590
That's,

2781
01:10:49,590 --> 01:10:49,940
that's,

2782
01:10:49,940 --> 01:10:50,671
that's the other thing.

2783
01:10:50,671 --> 01:10:51,504
There it is right there.

2784
01:10:51,980 --> 01:10:52,281
I mean,

2785
01:10:52,281 --> 01:10:52,951
we're sod beck.

2786
01:10:52,951 --> 01:10:53,360
Dick.

2787
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:55,430
It was super fucking talented,

2788
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:58,310
like just an undefeated
coming into this fight.

2789
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:03,640
Daren was covered in blood and he got
crucifixed here and he's getting smashed

2790
01:11:04,101 --> 01:11:05,420
with punches and elbows.

2791
01:11:06,020 --> 01:11:07,520
But elk hunt,

2792
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:09,170
he's just one of those guys.

2793
01:11:09,171 --> 01:11:10,310
Darren just doesn't give up.

2794
01:11:10,630 --> 01:11:12,470
And the other thing
about Messiah is massage.

2795
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:13,440
I've trained Messiah,

2796
01:11:13,450 --> 01:11:14,640
Messiah trains hard.

2797
01:11:14,650 --> 01:11:17,520
His conditioning earlier that
is conditioning is on point.

2798
01:11:17,780 --> 01:11:18,613
Look do this.

2799
01:11:19,990 --> 01:11:20,823
That's crazy.

2800
01:11:21,460 --> 01:11:22,570
That's so crazy.

2801
01:11:22,870 --> 01:11:23,051
Yo,

2802
01:11:23,051 --> 01:11:26,650
there's another screen like that
when cat Zingano beat Amanda Nunez.

2803
01:11:26,950 --> 01:11:27,311
Yeah.

2804
01:11:27,311 --> 01:11:28,420
It's another one like that.

2805
01:11:28,490 --> 01:11:30,310
I don't remember her victory dude.

2806
01:11:30,311 --> 01:11:31,690
That one is bone chilling.

2807
01:11:31,691 --> 01:11:32,740
You hear the scream,

2808
01:11:32,741 --> 01:11:33,130
you're like,

2809
01:11:33,130 --> 01:11:33,963
whoa.

2810
01:11:35,410 --> 01:11:36,910
Like it gets your hair like I might,

2811
01:11:36,911 --> 01:11:38,700
I got goosebumps just thinking about it.

2812
01:11:38,701 --> 01:11:39,070
Yeah.

2813
01:11:39,070 --> 01:11:39,903
Listen to that

2814
01:11:45,220 --> 01:11:46,060
dude.

2815
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:47,500
That meant a lot to her man.

2816
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:48,940
You can hear it.

2817
01:11:48,940 --> 01:11:49,540
Yeah.

2818
01:11:49,540 --> 01:11:50,373
Dude,

2819
01:11:51,430 --> 01:11:52,660
that's some shit you can't fake.

2820
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:53,110
Yeah.

2821
01:11:53,110 --> 01:11:53,660
You know,

2822
01:11:53,660 --> 01:11:56,440
there's something about what
you were saying though about um,

2823
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:59,380
people like walking
away from these things.

2824
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:01,793
It's,

2825
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:04,180
it makes me think of like of a kid,

2826
01:12:04,230 --> 01:12:05,160
I'm sorry this is,

2827
01:12:05,161 --> 01:12:07,840
this is going to be like a bunch
of things tied into one thing,

2828
01:12:07,841 --> 01:12:08,674
but

2829
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:11,230
babies when they're first born,

2830
01:12:11,350 --> 01:12:14,140
like first thing that come
out of babies usually cry.

2831
01:12:14,141 --> 01:12:14,490
Right?

2832
01:12:14,490 --> 01:12:14,800
Right.

2833
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:18,940
And it's like my thought on that is
like this is the first time they felt

2834
01:12:18,941 --> 01:12:20,500
anything outside of that womb.

2835
01:12:20,590 --> 01:12:21,100
Right.

2836
01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:21,361
And,

2837
01:12:21,361 --> 01:12:23,920
and they don't know what pain
is like a pain tolerance.

2838
01:12:23,921 --> 01:12:26,290
The first time you got kicked it it,

2839
01:12:26,610 --> 01:12:28,240
it hurts a lot more than it does now.

2840
01:12:28,410 --> 01:12:28,750
Yeah.

2841
01:12:28,750 --> 01:12:29,081
Right.

2842
01:12:29,081 --> 01:12:31,690
So like every sensation is new for them.

2843
01:12:31,691 --> 01:12:31,961
Right.

2844
01:12:31,961 --> 01:12:33,610
And then you're growing
up and you grow up to be,

2845
01:12:33,611 --> 01:12:34,321
these people in your,

2846
01:12:34,321 --> 01:12:35,890
your parents are telling
you can do anything,

2847
01:12:36,130 --> 01:12:38,410
but at the same time they're
telling you don't do that.

2848
01:12:38,890 --> 01:12:39,640
Right.

2849
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:40,473
So it's like,

2850
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:41,560
like the mind is,

2851
01:12:41,620 --> 01:12:42,580
your brain is this,

2852
01:12:42,581 --> 01:12:46,660
this is a blank slate when you're
born and you get all these different

2853
01:12:46,661 --> 01:12:47,494
influences.

2854
01:12:47,710 --> 01:12:50,980
And this goes back to
the people that are like,

2855
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:51,911
I can't catch a break.

2856
01:12:51,911 --> 01:12:52,900
I can't get your break.

2857
01:12:53,110 --> 01:12:53,980
It's like,

2858
01:12:54,460 --> 01:12:55,293
are we,

2859
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:57,850
are we doing this right?

2860
01:12:57,910 --> 01:13:00,580
Because for so many people
that have this attitude,

2861
01:13:01,030 --> 01:13:01,511
you know,

2862
01:13:01,511 --> 01:13:02,650
I'm like,

2863
01:13:02,710 --> 01:13:02,941
what,

2864
01:13:02,941 --> 01:13:03,311
where,

2865
01:13:03,311 --> 01:13:04,420
where is that coming from?

2866
01:13:04,421 --> 01:13:05,320
Because it's,

2867
01:13:05,410 --> 01:13:08,140
there are so many people like that and
then there are people that are like that

2868
01:13:08,141 --> 01:13:10,210
at times and then,

2869
01:13:10,450 --> 01:13:10,961
but they can,

2870
01:13:10,961 --> 01:13:14,180
they can either come out of it
and started having good things or,

2871
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:16,450
and then they go back into it
and they bounced back and forth.

2872
01:13:16,900 --> 01:13:18,910
But why are people the way they are?

2873
01:13:18,911 --> 01:13:19,810
Like the Ma,

2874
01:13:20,350 --> 01:13:23,860
the human mind to me is
like the most amazing,

2875
01:13:23,861 --> 01:13:25,060
confusing.

2876
01:13:25,570 --> 01:13:26,403
Like ev,

2877
01:13:26,950 --> 01:13:27,731
it's everything,

2878
01:13:27,731 --> 01:13:29,620
but like there's no rule.

2879
01:13:29,910 --> 01:13:30,230
Yeah,

2880
01:13:30,230 --> 01:13:30,821
that's what it is.

2881
01:13:30,821 --> 01:13:30,921
Yeah.

2882
01:13:30,921 --> 01:13:31,151
I mean,

2883
01:13:31,151 --> 01:13:32,420
everybody's different there.

2884
01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:33,400
Everybody's similar,

2885
01:13:33,401 --> 01:13:34,390
but everybody's different.

2886
01:13:34,870 --> 01:13:37,900
And your attitude has a giant effect,

2887
01:13:38,170 --> 01:13:41,890
not just on your life but on
other people's lives around you.

2888
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:43,180
That's the other thing about it.

2889
01:13:43,210 --> 01:13:43,451
Those,

2890
01:13:43,451 --> 01:13:44,830
I can't catch a break guys.

2891
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:46,840
Get them the fuck away from me.

2892
01:13:47,050 --> 01:13:47,590
I can't,

2893
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:48,910
I can't be around those guys.

2894
01:13:48,970 --> 01:13:50,110
I don't want to hear that shit.

2895
01:13:50,590 --> 01:13:51,640
I don't want to hear that shit.

2896
01:13:51,670 --> 01:13:54,250
I don't buy it because
everybody has bad brakes.

2897
01:13:54,251 --> 01:13:54,371
Yeah.

2898
01:13:54,371 --> 01:13:56,110
I've had a shit ton of bad breaks,

2899
01:13:56,230 --> 01:13:57,070
but you know what I did?

2900
01:13:57,100 --> 01:14:02,100
I stayed up and I thought through it and
I figured out what the fuck I did wrong

2901
01:14:02,230 --> 01:14:03,160
and then I went back.

2902
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:06,430
It's like I fucked up everything
I've ever done a hundred times.

2903
01:14:06,700 --> 01:14:07,533
There's no way to other,

2904
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:10,870
there's no other way to do it and I've
had a bunch of shitty breaks everybody,

2905
01:14:11,260 --> 01:14:12,250
but you got to realize

2906
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:13,180
when you have those shitty breaks,

2907
01:14:13,181 --> 01:14:14,014
what that is,

2908
01:14:14,170 --> 01:14:17,230
it's an opportunity for you to reassess,

2909
01:14:17,231 --> 01:14:17,831
reboot,

2910
01:14:17,831 --> 01:14:18,521
get better,

2911
01:14:18,521 --> 01:14:19,660
figure out another way,

2912
01:14:19,661 --> 01:14:21,040
find another way through.

2913
01:14:21,250 --> 01:14:21,511
It's,

2914
01:14:21,511 --> 01:14:24,430
this is just a little challenges and the
people that look at those challenges to

2915
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:24,581
gold,

2916
01:14:24,581 --> 01:14:26,260
one whoa does have its challenges,

2917
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:27,393
their cancer,

2918
01:14:27,580 --> 01:14:29,110
those people are dangerous to be around.

2919
01:14:29,111 --> 01:14:30,820
They will rob you of your enthusiasm.

2920
01:14:30,821 --> 01:14:33,320
They don't give you any fuel
that the opposite of fuel,

2921
01:14:34,050 --> 01:14:35,360
the fuel people there,

2922
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:35,690
the whole,

2923
01:14:35,690 --> 01:14:36,970
the people that are kicking ass,

2924
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:38,980
the people that are out
there just fucking hustling,

2925
01:14:39,010 --> 01:14:39,551
always,

2926
01:14:39,551 --> 01:14:40,900
always getting things done.

2927
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:45,310
It got like my friend Jocko every morning
I'll check his Instagram page for 30

2928
01:14:45,311 --> 01:14:45,551
shows,

2929
01:14:45,551 --> 01:14:46,450
a picture of his watch.

2930
01:14:46,451 --> 01:14:47,284
Get after it.

2931
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:49,420
He's out there working out
four 30 in the morning.

2932
01:14:49,630 --> 01:14:50,770
He does it every fucking morning.

2933
01:14:50,771 --> 01:14:51,041
Why?

2934
01:14:51,041 --> 01:14:51,700
Because,

2935
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:53,530
cause he doesn't want to
and that's how you do it.

2936
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:54,520
You go and get after it.

2937
01:14:54,521 --> 01:14:57,460
You don't make any excuses and
those kind of guys are fuel.

2938
01:14:57,550 --> 01:14:58,151
But those,

2939
01:14:58,151 --> 01:14:59,440
I can't catch a break guys.

2940
01:14:59,650 --> 01:15:00,770
They're the opposite of fuel.

2941
01:15:00,771 --> 01:15:02,110
They just pissing on your fire.

2942
01:15:02,350 --> 01:15:03,183
They're no fun.

2943
01:15:03,220 --> 01:15:03,611
And though,

2944
01:15:03,611 --> 01:15:07,540
and then the people that surround them
are all idiots because only idiots want

2945
01:15:07,541 --> 01:15:08,081
to be around.

2946
01:15:08,081 --> 01:15:08,950
I can't catch a break.

2947
01:15:08,951 --> 01:15:12,010
Guys owned a dummy stick
around after a while.

2948
01:15:12,011 --> 01:15:13,000
Even if they're your good friend,

2949
01:15:13,001 --> 01:15:13,720
you've got to be like,

2950
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:13,991
Bro,

2951
01:15:13,991 --> 01:15:15,460
you got to fucking stop.

2952
01:15:15,700 --> 01:15:16,630
You've gotta stop with all this.

2953
01:15:16,631 --> 01:15:17,650
I can't catch a break.

2954
01:15:17,660 --> 01:15:19,000
Bullshit all the time.

2955
01:15:19,001 --> 01:15:19,990
Your complaining.

2956
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:21,730
You could be instead hustling.

2957
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:23,680
You could be instead chasing your dream.

2958
01:15:23,681 --> 01:15:26,140
You could be instead figuring
out what you're doing wrong,

2959
01:15:26,141 --> 01:15:27,820
trying to improve certain
aspects of your life,

2960
01:15:27,821 --> 01:15:28,720
getting your shit together,

2961
01:15:28,721 --> 01:15:29,500
reading a book,

2962
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:31,120
meditating something,

2963
01:15:31,330 --> 01:15:32,440
fucking something.

2964
01:15:32,620 --> 01:15:32,981
But this,

2965
01:15:32,981 --> 01:15:33,910
I can't catch a break.

2966
01:15:33,910 --> 01:15:37,210
Shit is not helping anybody and
it pushes everybody away from you.

2967
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:41,170
But some people they get caught in that
pattern and it might be their parents.

2968
01:15:41,260 --> 01:15:42,700
It might be how they were raised.

2969
01:15:42,730 --> 01:15:45,100
Somebody might've told him they
were useless real early on.

2970
01:15:45,101 --> 01:15:46,390
It's stuck and they just,

2971
01:15:46,391 --> 01:15:47,224
they always,

2972
01:15:47,260 --> 01:15:49,690
they never feel like they
get enough reassurance.

2973
01:15:49,691 --> 01:15:53,650
They never feel like they get enough
motivation and they feel like other people

2974
01:15:53,651 --> 01:15:56,740
get more and they look at all these
other people who commute to hook them.

2975
01:15:56,741 --> 01:15:57,574
She gets this,

2976
01:15:57,640 --> 01:16:01,420
how come he's got that going on and
that all that's bad for you too.

2977
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:02,980
That shit ain't no good for you.

2978
01:16:03,010 --> 01:16:07,300
How much of that is tied into
not paying attention to yourself?

2979
01:16:07,330 --> 01:16:07,601
Not,

2980
01:16:07,601 --> 01:16:09,070
not knowing yourself,

2981
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:09,940
you know how much time,

2982
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:13,590
how much of that is his
time as tuned into a,

2983
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:17,890
tied into you always on your brain,

2984
01:16:17,891 --> 01:16:18,930
always outside of yourself.

2985
01:16:18,930 --> 01:16:19,100
You,

2986
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:20,440
you've flushing,

2987
01:16:20,470 --> 01:16:23,740
you're flooding your brain with
TV or Instagram or you know,

2988
01:16:23,741 --> 01:16:24,071
and not,

2989
01:16:24,071 --> 01:16:28,990
not something that even even
reading a book I believe is,

2990
01:16:29,020 --> 01:16:29,853
is different.

2991
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:30,430
Oh,

2992
01:16:30,430 --> 01:16:31,510
when you're watching TV,

2993
01:16:31,511 --> 01:16:32,350
what you're watching,

2994
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:33,393
you know what I mean?

2995
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:34,560
If you're watching something that,

2996
01:16:34,561 --> 01:16:37,120
that has a message where
you have to think where you,

2997
01:16:37,121 --> 01:16:41,620
you can see yourself in that and you
can put yourself in these situations and

2998
01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:42,310
you're like,

2999
01:16:42,310 --> 01:16:43,143
oh well that's,

3000
01:16:43,240 --> 01:16:44,350
I can empathize with that.

3001
01:16:44,351 --> 01:16:44,401
Oh,

3002
01:16:44,401 --> 01:16:44,980
I can this.

3003
01:16:44,980 --> 01:16:46,210
But when you're just watching,

3004
01:16:46,540 --> 01:16:47,373
oh,

3005
01:16:47,860 --> 01:16:49,400
spending money on cars and,

3006
01:16:49,401 --> 01:16:51,610
and making it rain and this and that,

3007
01:16:51,611 --> 01:16:51,970
you know,

3008
01:16:51,970 --> 01:16:52,803
um,

3009
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:54,190
and wonder how much of that,

3010
01:16:54,191 --> 01:16:59,191
because like the thing and I've found
is like entertainment isn't what it used

3011
01:17:00,161 --> 01:17:01,680
to be and this,

3012
01:17:01,681 --> 01:17:02,231
this is,

3013
01:17:02,231 --> 01:17:03,520
I'm going to sound old as shit,

3014
01:17:03,521 --> 01:17:04,354
right.

3015
01:17:05,050 --> 01:17:05,890
Back in my day,

3016
01:17:06,230 --> 01:17:08,890
entertainment entertainment
wasn't what it is now.

3017
01:17:09,140 --> 01:17:09,973
It's just like

3018
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:11,900
bright lights and flashing bombs.

3019
01:17:11,930 --> 01:17:12,230
Right.

3020
01:17:12,230 --> 01:17:14,750
Versus like something that
you could actually feel.

3021
01:17:14,751 --> 01:17:16,640
I feel like it's a lot less of that.

3022
01:17:16,730 --> 01:17:16,881
Well,

3023
01:17:16,881 --> 01:17:19,490
there's some entertainment that
you could feel like TV shows.

3024
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:22,730
Do you watch black mirror that'll freak
the fuck out of you or make you think

3025
01:17:22,731 --> 01:17:24,680
there's still some good
shit that's being made.

3026
01:17:24,810 --> 01:17:25,750
The stranger things there's,

3027
01:17:25,930 --> 01:17:27,800
and go find it so much more.

3028
01:17:27,830 --> 01:17:29,210
Like I feel like the,

3029
01:17:29,211 --> 01:17:30,170
the bigger things,

3030
01:17:30,171 --> 01:17:32,660
like the things that most
people have access to

3031
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:36,140
that I think that's what it is.

3032
01:17:36,230 --> 01:17:36,590
Right,

3033
01:17:36,590 --> 01:17:36,950
right.

3034
01:17:36,950 --> 01:17:40,240
But is it that they have more access
to that or is that the easiest thing to

3035
01:17:40,430 --> 01:17:41,570
easiest thing to,

3036
01:17:41,571 --> 01:17:42,404
to consume?

3037
01:17:42,410 --> 01:17:43,820
It's very easy to consume.

3038
01:17:43,821 --> 01:17:46,280
It's mindless and everybody wants cars.

3039
01:17:46,310 --> 01:17:46,671
Uber,

3040
01:17:46,671 --> 01:17:47,210
the car,

3041
01:17:47,210 --> 01:17:48,110
everybody wants money.

3042
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:48,953
Look at his money.

3043
01:17:49,130 --> 01:17:49,401
You know,

3044
01:17:49,401 --> 01:17:51,660
it's like you just get
sucked up in it and it's,

3045
01:17:51,670 --> 01:17:55,430
it's a very low level frequency
that everybody sorta has
like a little bit of it

3046
01:17:55,431 --> 01:17:56,181
and you see this,

3047
01:17:56,181 --> 01:17:58,280
I'm dude with his open shirt,

3048
01:17:58,310 --> 01:18:02,780
all these chains and it's always
girls behind him and their underwear.

3049
01:18:02,870 --> 01:18:03,701
Everybody's dancing.

3050
01:18:03,701 --> 01:18:05,030
It's like this guy's life's a party.

3051
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:06,260
My life is a party.

3052
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:07,700
I can't catch a fucking break.

3053
01:18:07,900 --> 01:18:08,481
I'm over here.

3054
01:18:08,481 --> 01:18:09,870
A current character work.

3055
01:18:10,490 --> 01:18:10,990
It's cool.

3056
01:18:10,990 --> 01:18:11,250
It's,

3057
01:18:11,250 --> 01:18:12,890
it's cool sometimes,

3058
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:13,753
you know,

3059
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:14,990
sometimes it's silly.

3060
01:18:15,170 --> 01:18:15,471
Yeah,

3061
01:18:15,471 --> 01:18:16,150
exactly.

3062
01:18:16,150 --> 01:18:17,390
Because there's a point like,

3063
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:18,591
you know,

3064
01:18:18,591 --> 01:18:18,891
who's,

3065
01:18:18,891 --> 01:18:23,620
who's a deep guy fucking chilling
and Shell is very deep and he,

3066
01:18:23,621 --> 01:18:24,170
he,

3067
01:18:24,170 --> 01:18:26,690
he pointed this out to me
through a different way,

3068
01:18:26,691 --> 01:18:30,130
but there's a point where
everything becomes a bad thing.

3069
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:31,720
There's a point where like humility is,

3070
01:18:31,721 --> 01:18:31,921
is a,

3071
01:18:31,921 --> 01:18:32,754
is a bad thing.

3072
01:18:33,020 --> 01:18:36,860
There's a point where I'm
having fun as a bad thing.

3073
01:18:37,100 --> 01:18:38,930
It's like you can't,

3074
01:18:39,050 --> 01:18:39,883
you can't,

3075
01:18:40,210 --> 01:18:41,090
like eating does,

3076
01:18:41,091 --> 01:18:43,290
it isn't always a pleasure if you,

3077
01:18:43,300 --> 01:18:44,300
if you're constantly eating,

3078
01:18:44,301 --> 01:18:45,410
if you're never hungry,

3079
01:18:45,620 --> 01:18:47,750
you don't appreciate it as
much as if you are hungry.

3080
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:49,581
Because if you're,

3081
01:18:49,581 --> 01:18:51,910
if you're starving and they
feed you and you can start you,

3082
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:54,020
you're full and you have to keep eating,

3083
01:18:54,050 --> 01:18:54,840
that's not fun.

3084
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:55,261
Right,

3085
01:18:55,261 --> 01:18:55,521
right,

3086
01:18:55,521 --> 01:18:55,850
right.

3087
01:18:55,850 --> 01:18:56,240
Yeah.

3088
01:18:56,240 --> 01:18:56,921
So there's,

3089
01:18:56,921 --> 01:19:00,290
there's this moderation thing that I feel
that's missing and I'm trying to find

3090
01:19:00,291 --> 01:19:01,400
that balance with myself,

3091
01:19:01,401 --> 01:19:01,820
man,

3092
01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:02,653
with what?

3093
01:19:03,020 --> 01:19:03,980
With life with,

3094
01:19:03,981 --> 01:19:05,810
with the bunch of different things,

3095
01:19:05,811 --> 01:19:06,021
um,

3096
01:19:06,021 --> 01:19:06,291
with,

3097
01:19:06,291 --> 01:19:08,750
with how much time I spend
doing this versus this.

3098
01:19:08,751 --> 01:19:10,780
Especially now that I'm
not fighting because that,

3099
01:19:10,781 --> 01:19:12,440
that was for a long time.

3100
01:19:12,441 --> 01:19:14,810
That was the biggest part of my days.

3101
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:15,170
You know,

3102
01:19:15,170 --> 01:19:18,920
just just training and everything
else and now I still get to train,

3103
01:19:19,130 --> 01:19:23,570
but I have more time and a lot
of time by myself in my own head.

3104
01:19:23,660 --> 01:19:25,420
So I'm back to reading and listening.

3105
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:26,313
Schilling,

3106
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:31,480
the guard that exposed that crimes kid
for being a racist and his family was all

3107
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:32,931
written.

3108
01:19:32,931 --> 01:19:37,310
Then his mother said something like
contacted shilling about keeping money in

3109
01:19:37,311 --> 01:19:38,930
the Wa with the whites or some shit.

3110
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:39,261
Yeah,

3111
01:19:39,261 --> 01:19:39,950
Joe was,

3112
01:19:39,950 --> 01:19:41,300
Joe reached out because he wanted to,

3113
01:19:41,301 --> 01:19:42,030
he wanted to know,

3114
01:19:42,030 --> 01:19:44,230
want to like bring the kid
out or training or something.

3115
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:45,130
Go tour event.

3116
01:19:45,340 --> 01:19:45,800
The kid,

3117
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:46,400
the kid,

3118
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:47,600
it was a a viral,

3119
01:19:47,660 --> 01:19:49,400
we shouldn't pull the kid up to Jones.

3120
01:19:49,430 --> 01:19:50,450
He's a little kid.

3121
01:19:50,930 --> 01:19:51,470
He's,

3122
01:19:51,470 --> 01:19:51,771
you know,

3123
01:19:51,771 --> 01:19:54,020
I don't feel like we should
give the kid anymore exposure.

3124
01:19:55,370 --> 01:19:57,470
It's not because the kid
didn't do anything wrong,

3125
01:19:57,820 --> 01:19:58,130
right.

3126
01:19:58,130 --> 01:19:59,040
He was just crying them up,

3127
01:19:59,041 --> 01:20:01,250
kind of bullied and everybody was like,

3128
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:01,431
oh,

3129
01:20:01,431 --> 01:20:02,300
this poor kid,

3130
01:20:02,390 --> 01:20:02,870
you know.

3131
01:20:02,870 --> 01:20:03,540
Now,

3132
01:20:03,540 --> 01:20:03,950
I don't,

3133
01:20:03,950 --> 01:20:04,740
I don't know this,

3134
01:20:04,740 --> 01:20:05,610
the part of,

3135
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:07,050
of his part in the,

3136
01:20:07,140 --> 01:20:07,980
the bullying thing,

3137
01:20:08,190 --> 01:20:09,930
but what we're talking about his,

3138
01:20:09,931 --> 01:20:10,201
his,

3139
01:20:10,201 --> 01:20:10,590
his,

3140
01:20:10,590 --> 01:20:13,620
his mom's conversation with Joseph
and that's where it got like,

3141
01:20:13,621 --> 01:20:14,510
that's where it got twisted.

3142
01:20:14,530 --> 01:20:17,580
It was that proven that was his mom
would definitely wasn't someone trolling,

3143
01:20:18,610 --> 01:20:19,590
I don't know.

3144
01:20:19,650 --> 01:20:21,180
Everything is fucking a mystery today.

3145
01:20:21,181 --> 01:20:21,811
Up is down,

3146
01:20:21,811 --> 01:20:23,570
down is up as a lot of trolls out there,

3147
01:20:23,571 --> 01:20:23,801
man.

3148
01:20:23,801 --> 01:20:24,150
I'm not,

3149
01:20:24,150 --> 01:20:24,841
I feel like,

3150
01:20:24,841 --> 01:20:26,160
I feel like there's been,

3151
01:20:26,190 --> 01:20:28,000
there's been reports that it was and they,

3152
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:31,620
and was reports that it wasn't and I
didn't pay so much attention to it that I

3153
01:20:31,621 --> 01:20:34,170
could be like positive as to what,

3154
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:36,060
what the ruling was put.

3155
01:20:36,060 --> 01:20:36,893
Um,

3156
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:41,850
the conversation that she had with Joe
was Joe reached out to bring him out and

3157
01:20:41,851 --> 01:20:42,684
um,

3158
01:20:42,780 --> 01:20:43,501
she was like,

3159
01:20:43,501 --> 01:20:43,711
look,

3160
01:20:43,711 --> 01:20:46,260
I'm just trying to put some
money in this account basically.

3161
01:20:46,770 --> 01:20:47,760
And um,

3162
01:20:47,790 --> 01:20:48,421
Joe is like,

3163
01:20:48,421 --> 01:20:48,631
Hey,

3164
01:20:48,631 --> 01:20:51,450
I'm trying to give him something
more valuable than money.

3165
01:20:51,870 --> 01:20:52,710
And um,

3166
01:20:53,220 --> 01:20:56,040
she said something she wanted
something else gofund gofundme.

3167
01:20:56,610 --> 01:21:00,360
And then there was something else Joe
said like what's the money going to like,

3168
01:21:00,361 --> 01:21:02,250
you can't cure bullying with money.

3169
01:21:02,300 --> 01:21:03,133
Yeah,

3170
01:21:03,660 --> 01:21:05,700
but I forgot how it turned
to some racial spend.

3171
01:21:05,701 --> 01:21:07,310
The money within the whites.

3172
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:07,711
Yeah.

3173
01:21:07,711 --> 01:21:08,191
It was something,

3174
01:21:08,191 --> 01:21:10,030
something along those lines but don't,

3175
01:21:10,150 --> 01:21:10,601
I don't know.

3176
01:21:10,601 --> 01:21:10,980
Like,

3177
01:21:10,980 --> 01:21:13,380
like why did she even bring that up?

3178
01:21:13,381 --> 01:21:17,640
Like what in Joe's contacts
made her go to that card.

3179
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:19,650
Why dude shaped head covered in tattoos.

3180
01:21:22,730 --> 01:21:24,000
She took a chance.

3181
01:21:24,001 --> 01:21:24,960
She's like white power,

3182
01:21:24,990 --> 01:21:25,823
white power.

3183
01:21:29,340 --> 01:21:30,240
She went fishing.

3184
01:21:30,870 --> 01:21:31,531
I don't know man.

3185
01:21:31,531 --> 01:21:32,101
I mean she made me,

3186
01:21:32,101 --> 01:21:33,240
she's just a fucking dummy.

3187
01:21:33,270 --> 01:21:33,710
I mean the,

3188
01:21:33,710 --> 01:21:33,881
the,

3189
01:21:33,881 --> 01:21:35,180
the family is concerned,

3190
01:21:35,460 --> 01:21:40,150
a confederate flag shirt and
some of their photos that's,

3191
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:41,610
that's still on the flag.

3192
01:21:41,611 --> 01:21:43,080
The state flag in Mississippi.

3193
01:21:43,670 --> 01:21:43,920
No,

3194
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:44,370
I didn't.

3195
01:21:44,370 --> 01:21:45,230
That's crazy.

3196
01:21:45,290 --> 01:21:45,750
See that,

3197
01:21:45,750 --> 01:21:48,540
that's crazy to me because like I
didn't grow up knowing him about that.

3198
01:21:48,541 --> 01:21:50,610
Like I like as a kid in The Bahamas,

3199
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:51,780
like I didn't even know,

3200
01:21:52,530 --> 01:21:55,110
I knew I came at 15.

3201
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:55,770
Uh,

3202
01:21:55,770 --> 01:21:56,370
yeah,

3203
01:21:56,370 --> 01:21:57,203
so like,

3204
01:21:57,210 --> 01:21:57,511
you know,

3205
01:21:57,511 --> 01:21:59,340
the years when everything is being set,

3206
01:21:59,820 --> 01:22:00,720
I was in The Bahamas,

3207
01:22:00,930 --> 01:22:01,763
in your brain.

3208
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:03,120
So when I got here,

3209
01:22:03,121 --> 01:22:05,550
like I still had no idea what
the confederate flag was.

3210
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:05,930
A,

3211
01:22:05,930 --> 01:22:10,830
I told us people like I didn't
know a lot of us history,

3212
01:22:10,890 --> 01:22:11,490
you know,

3213
01:22:11,490 --> 01:22:12,060
um,

3214
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:14,040
we learn Bahamian history and The Bahamas.

3215
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:16,110
And when I got here I didn't
know anything about that.

3216
01:22:16,111 --> 01:22:19,620
The confederate flag didn't mean anything
to me until I was in my twenties man.

3217
01:22:19,710 --> 01:22:20,543
Wow.

3218
01:22:20,550 --> 01:22:20,791
And,

3219
01:22:20,791 --> 01:22:22,230
and in Texas to this day,

3220
01:22:22,410 --> 01:22:24,000
my daughter where she lives,

3221
01:22:24,001 --> 01:22:26,760
warehouses maybe like four miles away,

3222
01:22:27,150 --> 01:22:31,320
I was visiting and they're there on the
corner with a trailer out and they've

3223
01:22:31,321 --> 01:22:34,230
got like confederate flags for sale,

3224
01:22:34,260 --> 01:22:36,120
for sale on the corner just lining up.

3225
01:22:36,121 --> 01:22:37,020
They have them out,

3226
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:37,470
you know,

3227
01:22:37,470 --> 01:22:38,580
just line up a flying.

3228
01:22:39,930 --> 01:22:40,890
People still drive around.

3229
01:22:40,891 --> 01:22:43,320
I was in Florida with Dustin and Numb,

3230
01:22:43,590 --> 01:22:47,730
we were driving and there was a truck
with a US flag posted on the back.

3231
01:22:47,790 --> 01:22:48,930
And confederates with not,

3232
01:22:49,060 --> 01:22:50,520
not like posted on the car.

3233
01:22:50,521 --> 01:22:50,870
I mean,

3234
01:22:50,870 --> 01:22:54,690
when a flag pole flying the
flag pole as they're driving.

3235
01:22:56,270 --> 01:22:57,270
So this is a real thing.

3236
01:22:57,300 --> 01:22:58,710
You love the south.

3237
01:22:59,070 --> 01:23:00,780
The south needs a new flag.

3238
01:23:01,620 --> 01:23:03,210
You can't have a flag.

3239
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:04,520
I got no problem with you.

3240
01:23:04,550 --> 01:23:05,383
Love in the,

3241
01:23:05,650 --> 01:23:06,220
the south

3242
01:23:06,220 --> 01:23:07,460
got a lot of great quality.

3243
01:23:07,510 --> 01:23:09,640
Know you guys need a new flag.

3244
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:13,210
You can't have the flag of the
dudes who are fighting for slavery.

3245
01:23:13,510 --> 01:23:15,330
You can't have that anymore Joe.

3246
01:23:15,340 --> 01:23:16,450
They weren't fighting for slavery.

3247
01:23:18,430 --> 01:23:18,730
Yeah.

3248
01:23:18,730 --> 01:23:19,070
They,

3249
01:23:19,070 --> 01:23:21,100
that argument is a piss poor argument.

3250
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:22,000
It falls apart.

3251
01:23:22,570 --> 01:23:25,090
That argument is one of the shittiest
arguments and people try to,

3252
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:29,740
they try to like soldier up and use
big words and try to repackage that

3253
01:23:29,741 --> 01:23:30,574
argument.

3254
01:23:30,670 --> 01:23:32,560
They wanted slavery period.

3255
01:23:32,860 --> 01:23:34,530
They're fighting for economics.

3256
01:23:34,570 --> 01:23:34,900
Yeah.

3257
01:23:34,900 --> 01:23:35,470
Slavery.

3258
01:23:35,470 --> 01:23:36,760
They wanted people to work for free.

3259
01:23:37,090 --> 01:23:38,440
That's like a big part of what it was.

3260
01:23:38,441 --> 01:23:40,390
There was a lot of other
shit going on as well.

3261
01:23:40,540 --> 01:23:41,380
That was a big part of it.

3262
01:23:41,381 --> 01:23:42,610
That was a huge part of it.

3263
01:23:42,670 --> 01:23:43,361
And I mean it's,

3264
01:23:43,361 --> 01:23:47,800
it's representative in the laws that
came right after slavery was abolished.

3265
01:23:48,070 --> 01:23:50,650
Did you know that there's a reason why,

3266
01:23:50,651 --> 01:23:50,891
you know,

3267
01:23:50,891 --> 01:23:52,600
when people think about
people from the south,

3268
01:23:52,840 --> 01:23:54,670
people think of them as being like slack,

3269
01:23:54,671 --> 01:23:56,380
jawed and kind of stupid.

3270
01:23:56,410 --> 01:23:58,240
That's like the worst stereotype.

3271
01:23:58,241 --> 01:23:58,421
Right?

3272
01:23:58,421 --> 01:23:58,780
Right.

3273
01:23:58,780 --> 01:24:00,430
Southern people knew her,

3274
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:00,821
Yo,

3275
01:24:00,821 --> 01:24:01,290
dude.

3276
01:24:01,290 --> 01:24:02,080
Yeah.

3277
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:07,080
There was a hookworm epidemic in the south
for years where a substantial portion

3278
01:24:08,650 --> 01:24:13,060
of the population had hookworm where they
were walking around barefoot and they

3279
01:24:13,061 --> 01:24:18,061
got shit in their fee and those parasites
infected their brain and compromise

3280
01:24:18,311 --> 01:24:22,480
the way they think and
severely diminishes your,

3281
01:24:22,481 --> 01:24:23,680
your level of thinking.

3282
01:24:24,130 --> 01:24:25,570
So does that,

3283
01:24:25,930 --> 01:24:26,763
um,

3284
01:24:27,010 --> 01:24:27,701
pull that shit up,

3285
01:24:27,701 --> 01:24:28,534
Jamie does that,

3286
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:30,220
that came up out of a podcast,

3287
01:24:30,221 --> 01:24:30,540
right?

3288
01:24:30,540 --> 01:24:32,110
Didn't someone bring it up to us?

3289
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:33,970
I feel like it was Rhonda Pat.

3290
01:24:33,980 --> 01:24:34,410
No.

3291
01:24:34,410 --> 01:24:35,243
Was it Rhonda?

3292
01:24:35,350 --> 01:24:36,183
Someone like that.

3293
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:37,540
Some smarty pants.

3294
01:24:38,050 --> 01:24:38,980
When that happens,

3295
01:24:39,010 --> 01:24:39,370
um,

3296
01:24:39,370 --> 01:24:39,970
does that,

3297
01:24:39,970 --> 01:24:40,830
does that well,

3298
01:24:40,900 --> 01:24:42,040
however that affects your brain.

3299
01:24:42,041 --> 01:24:43,370
Does that pass on it?

3300
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:45,330
You know what I'm getting questions like,

3301
01:24:45,350 --> 01:24:46,780
is your low change your DNA?

3302
01:24:47,420 --> 01:24:48,253
I bet it does.

3303
01:24:48,310 --> 01:24:49,780
I bet everything changes your DNA.

3304
01:24:50,350 --> 01:24:50,980
Here it goes.

3305
01:24:50,980 --> 01:24:53,050
How a worm gave the south a bad name.

3306
01:24:53,350 --> 01:24:54,183
Here it is.

3307
01:24:54,460 --> 01:24:55,300
Make the shit a little bigger.

3308
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:55,930
Uh,

3309
01:24:55,930 --> 01:24:56,980
for more than three centuries,

3310
01:24:56,981 --> 01:24:58,060
a plague of unshakable,

3311
01:24:58,061 --> 01:25:00,550
lethargic blanketed the American south.

3312
01:25:00,551 --> 01:25:02,200
It began with ground itch,

3313
01:25:02,380 --> 01:25:07,060
a prickly tingling in the tender webs
between the toes soon followed by a dry

3314
01:25:07,061 --> 01:25:07,511
cough.

3315
01:25:07,511 --> 01:25:08,051
Weeks later,

3316
01:25:08,051 --> 01:25:12,280
victim succumb to an insatiable exhaustion
and an impenetrable haziness of the

3317
01:25:12,281 --> 01:25:14,710
mind that some called stupidity.

3318
01:25:15,070 --> 01:25:19,450
Adults neglected their fields and
children grew pale and listless victims

3319
01:25:19,451 --> 01:25:22,840
develop grossly distended
bellies and angel wings.

3320
01:25:22,841 --> 01:25:27,841
A macerated shoulderblades accentuated
by hunching all gays doubt Deli from

3321
01:25:27,851 --> 01:25:30,670
sunken sockets with a
telltale fisheye stare.

3322
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:34,240
The culprit behind the germ of laziness
of the south's affliction was sometimes

3323
01:25:34,241 --> 01:25:34,930
called,

3324
01:25:34,930 --> 01:25:39,880
was nick k tore Americana's
the American murderer.

3325
01:25:39,970 --> 01:25:40,570
Wow.

3326
01:25:40,570 --> 01:25:42,220
Better known today as the Hookworm,

3327
01:25:42,580 --> 01:25:45,370
millions of those blood
sucking parasites lived,

3328
01:25:45,460 --> 01:25:46,120
fed,

3329
01:25:46,120 --> 01:25:46,931
multiplied,

3330
01:25:46,931 --> 01:25:51,130
and died within the guts of
up to 40% of the population.

3331
01:25:51,150 --> 01:25:54,400
Stretching from southern
southeastern Texas to West Virginia.

3332
01:25:54,690 --> 01:25:59,230
Hooks warms stymied development throughout
the region and bread stereotypes

3333
01:25:59,231 --> 01:26:00,070
about lazy,

3334
01:26:00,071 --> 01:26:01,510
Moronic southerners.

3335
01:26:01,690 --> 01:26:03,530
So where do you as you're reading that,

3336
01:26:03,531 --> 01:26:04,640
fuck yeah,

3337
01:26:04,641 --> 01:26:05,181
that's gross.

3338
01:26:05,181 --> 01:26:08,030
I remember learning about
hookworms as a kid in The Bahamas,

3339
01:26:08,031 --> 01:26:08,890
but I,

3340
01:26:08,990 --> 01:26:09,830
as you're reading that,

3341
01:26:09,831 --> 01:26:10,664
I'm like,

3342
01:26:10,730 --> 01:26:11,330
you know what?

3343
01:26:11,330 --> 01:26:12,500
Maybe this is,

3344
01:26:12,501 --> 01:26:14,780
I go through this whole thing
in my brain as you're reading.

3345
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:19,960
Maybe if they didn't do what they did to
native Americans because those guys had

3346
01:26:20,061 --> 01:26:24,350
moccasins and they probably had magazines
because they learned about this a

3347
01:26:24,350 --> 01:26:25,150
couple of hundred years ago.

3348
01:26:25,150 --> 01:26:25,831
You know what I mean?

3349
01:26:25,831 --> 01:26:26,361
No Shit.

3350
01:26:26,361 --> 01:26:27,194
Right.

3351
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:28,760
If anybody was going to be barefoot,

3352
01:26:28,761 --> 01:26:29,720
it'd be the native American.

3353
01:26:29,721 --> 01:26:30,170
Right.

3354
01:26:30,170 --> 01:26:30,620
And they were like,

3355
01:26:30,620 --> 01:26:31,453
no dog.

3356
01:26:31,850 --> 01:26:32,683
Not a good move.

3357
01:26:32,970 --> 01:26:33,830
Got To cover your feet,

3358
01:26:33,831 --> 01:26:34,011
man.

3359
01:26:34,011 --> 01:26:36,500
It's been shit gets in there
and get stupid and can't
figure out how to find the

3360
01:26:36,501 --> 01:26:37,334
buffalo anymore.

3361
01:26:37,340 --> 01:26:37,770
That's where,

3362
01:26:37,770 --> 01:26:41,140
that's where that's sharing
information comes in handy,

3363
01:26:41,141 --> 01:26:41,810
man.

3364
01:26:41,810 --> 01:26:42,920
That's a good point.

3365
01:26:43,130 --> 01:26:44,150
That's a real good point.

3366
01:26:44,151 --> 01:26:47,290
Cause I always think that when I
see that all those survivor dudes,

3367
01:26:47,291 --> 01:26:48,560
I like to walk around barefoot.

3368
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:53,150
It was crazy dudes to get the thick
calluses and the bottom of their feet and

3369
01:26:53,151 --> 01:26:53,811
their idea is that,

3370
01:26:53,811 --> 01:26:54,390
you know like,

3371
01:26:54,390 --> 01:26:54,651
hey,

3372
01:26:54,651 --> 01:26:55,880
if the world goes to shrimp,

3373
01:26:56,300 --> 01:26:58,190
you're going to need to
be able to walk barefoot.

3374
01:26:59,480 --> 01:26:59,781
Yeah.

3375
01:26:59,781 --> 01:27:01,100
That doesn't make any sense.

3376
01:27:01,130 --> 01:27:01,820
Maybe.

3377
01:27:01,820 --> 01:27:02,750
Maybe you make shoes,

3378
01:27:02,751 --> 01:27:03,584
you fuck,

3379
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:06,170
you know there's a bunch of
shoes and warehouses the world.

3380
01:27:06,580 --> 01:27:06,821
Yeah,

3381
01:27:06,821 --> 01:27:07,190
exactly.

3382
01:27:07,190 --> 01:27:08,023
How,

3383
01:27:08,090 --> 01:27:09,890
how would you run out of shoes?

3384
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:10,371
I mean,

3385
01:27:10,371 --> 01:27:11,150
if you just,

3386
01:27:11,150 --> 01:27:11,731
if you found it,

3387
01:27:11,731 --> 01:27:12,480
the world was gonna End,

3388
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:15,530
you bought 20 pairs of shoes
that might last you two,

3389
01:27:15,531 --> 01:27:16,364
you're dead.

3390
01:27:16,850 --> 01:27:17,683
Yeah.

3391
01:27:17,690 --> 01:27:19,610
Maybe it depends on what you're doing.

3392
01:27:20,030 --> 01:27:20,790
What kind of hiking.

3393
01:27:20,790 --> 01:27:21,623
You're running a lot.

3394
01:27:22,060 --> 01:27:22,790
Burn through those.

3395
01:27:22,790 --> 01:27:25,850
You gotta you're going to have to be on
your feet more because you got hunt now.

3396
01:27:25,910 --> 01:27:26,570
That's true.

3397
01:27:26,570 --> 01:27:27,650
You're going to have to be hiking.

3398
01:27:27,890 --> 01:27:28,550
Yeah.

3399
01:27:28,550 --> 01:27:32,210
Maybe you need more than 20 you don't
need more than 50 50 pairs of shoes.

3400
01:27:32,660 --> 01:27:33,800
Probably repurpose them to,

3401
01:27:33,970 --> 01:27:34,460
yeah,

3402
01:27:34,460 --> 01:27:36,440
but that's what the native Americans did,

3403
01:27:36,470 --> 01:27:37,303
right?

3404
01:27:37,540 --> 01:27:38,050
Yeah.

3405
01:27:38,050 --> 01:27:38,380
They,

3406
01:27:38,380 --> 01:27:38,740
they,

3407
01:27:38,740 --> 01:27:39,101
they,

3408
01:27:39,101 --> 01:27:41,570
they used every piece of the Buffalo.

3409
01:27:41,630 --> 01:27:42,080
Yeah.

3410
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:42,530
You know,

3411
01:27:42,530 --> 01:27:44,420
they were smart too because
they didn't develop,

3412
01:27:44,421 --> 01:27:45,201
like I'm a,

3413
01:27:45,201 --> 01:27:47,000
I'm a on this barefoot running kick.

3414
01:27:47,110 --> 01:27:48,680
I run with barefoot shoes.

3415
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:51,170
I either run with those
Vibram five fingers,

3416
01:27:51,320 --> 01:27:52,400
which are my favorite,

3417
01:27:52,550 --> 01:27:53,790
but when it gets muddy out there,

3418
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:55,280
those don't have a lot of traction.

3419
01:27:55,310 --> 01:27:57,560
And I liked this other
company called Vivo Barefoot.

3420
01:27:57,770 --> 01:27:58,221
Plus they don't,

3421
01:27:58,221 --> 01:27:59,180
you don't look as Dorky.

3422
01:27:59,580 --> 01:28:00,050
The VI,

3423
01:28:00,050 --> 01:28:02,990
the five fingers ones you're
committing to the project,

3424
01:28:03,030 --> 01:28:03,320
right?

3425
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:05,360
You got to walk around
with gloves on your feet.

3426
01:28:06,020 --> 01:28:07,460
People mock you mercilessly.

3427
01:28:07,461 --> 01:28:08,031
Like Jamie,

3428
01:28:08,031 --> 01:28:09,140
he mocks me mercilessly.

3429
01:28:09,530 --> 01:28:09,921
But uh,

3430
01:28:09,921 --> 01:28:11,480
the Vivo barefoot wants to just like,

3431
01:28:11,510 --> 01:28:14,480
they just have no padding but
they have good traction's.

3432
01:28:14,481 --> 01:28:15,620
I like running in those too.

3433
01:28:15,890 --> 01:28:18,860
But when you run in something
that has no padding at all,

3434
01:28:19,030 --> 01:28:23,150
you do all the muscles in your foot
develop cause that your toes have to work

3435
01:28:23,151 --> 01:28:23,960
and push.

3436
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:25,790
Whereas like these things,

3437
01:28:26,270 --> 01:28:29,510
these things are way stiffer than
what I run with most of the time.

3438
01:28:29,511 --> 01:28:30,590
These things are hard,

3439
01:28:30,591 --> 01:28:30,711
man.

3440
01:28:30,711 --> 01:28:31,850
It's like a cast.

3441
01:28:32,030 --> 01:28:34,070
Like this shit is like
a cast for your foot,

3442
01:28:34,460 --> 01:28:34,731
you know?

3443
01:28:34,731 --> 01:28:37,670
And so the idea is when your foot is
in those kinds of like a normal running

3444
01:28:37,671 --> 01:28:38,390
shoe,

3445
01:28:38,390 --> 01:28:41,570
it's not really squishing
and pushing and you're all,

3446
01:28:41,571 --> 01:28:45,110
your muscles aren't getting activated
and so they're just not as strong.

3447
01:28:45,140 --> 01:28:45,530
They just,

3448
01:28:45,530 --> 01:28:46,363
they're just weaker,

3449
01:28:46,730 --> 01:28:47,091
you know,

3450
01:28:47,091 --> 01:28:48,350
and that it's not good for anything.

3451
01:28:48,351 --> 01:28:48,801
It's not good for,

3452
01:28:48,801 --> 01:28:49,700
your balance is not,

3453
01:28:49,701 --> 01:28:50,540
it's not optimum.

3454
01:28:50,570 --> 01:28:52,850
I mean it's better to run
with running shoes on then,

3455
01:28:52,851 --> 01:28:53,684
not Ron,

3456
01:28:53,810 --> 01:28:58,550
but in terms of like foot strength and
like just maximize your ability to move

3457
01:28:58,551 --> 01:29:00,050
correctly and have good balance.

3458
01:29:00,470 --> 01:29:01,410
It's not nearly good.

3459
01:29:01,790 --> 01:29:02,210
It's,

3460
01:29:02,210 --> 01:29:02,670
it's,

3461
01:29:02,670 --> 01:29:03,640
you can feel it too.

3462
01:29:03,641 --> 01:29:03,920
Um,

3463
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:06,870
when I first started
doing MMA for a long time,

3464
01:29:06,871 --> 01:29:09,900
until I went down to Florida
and was at American top team,

3465
01:29:10,830 --> 01:29:13,170
there were certain things that
I didn't do without shoes on.

3466
01:29:13,620 --> 01:29:15,080
Like if we were kickboxing,

3467
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:18,690
I would put on shins and I would
wear my wrestling shoes really?

3468
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:19,510
How come?

3469
01:29:19,510 --> 01:29:20,040
Um,

3470
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:23,100
I just didn't like wrestling
without my toes out like that,

3471
01:29:23,450 --> 01:29:23,730
you know?

3472
01:29:23,730 --> 01:29:25,470
Especially when I was throwing kicks,

3473
01:29:25,510 --> 01:29:25,740
right.

3474
01:29:25,740 --> 01:29:26,460
Not,

3475
01:29:26,460 --> 01:29:26,761
but,

3476
01:29:26,761 --> 01:29:27,050
um,

3477
01:29:27,050 --> 01:29:28,770
over time I got more comfortable with it,

3478
01:29:28,890 --> 01:29:30,840
but over time getting
more comfortable with it,

3479
01:29:30,841 --> 01:29:34,560
I could feel the difference when I would
have my shoes on versus not having my

3480
01:29:34,561 --> 01:29:34,890
shoot.

3481
01:29:34,890 --> 01:29:35,320
Um,

3482
01:29:35,320 --> 01:29:35,580
yeah.

3483
01:29:35,580 --> 01:29:38,230
Versus not having my shoes on and it's,

3484
01:29:38,440 --> 01:29:38,980
I had,

3485
01:29:38,980 --> 01:29:42,210
I felt more decks Darrius
I felt more agile.

3486
01:29:42,380 --> 01:29:44,610
It felt more in connection with,

3487
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:45,230
you know?

3488
01:29:45,230 --> 01:29:46,063
Yeah.

3489
01:29:46,140 --> 01:29:46,460
Yeah.

3490
01:29:46,460 --> 01:29:47,293
When I was doing,

3491
01:29:47,420 --> 01:29:47,541
yeah.

3492
01:29:47,541 --> 01:29:48,374
That's legit.

3493
01:29:48,410 --> 01:29:49,250
That's a,

3494
01:29:49,430 --> 01:29:52,640
I mean that's what I do with
these barefoot running shoes.

3495
01:29:52,670 --> 01:29:52,970
I mean,

3496
01:29:52,970 --> 01:29:54,440
I believe in him 100%.

3497
01:29:54,441 --> 01:29:57,650
I think there's a bunch of good companies
that make them Morel make some good

3498
01:29:57,651 --> 01:29:58,484
ones too.

3499
01:29:59,070 --> 01:29:59,510
Um,

3500
01:29:59,510 --> 01:30:03,380
but I just feel like we have
too much padding on our shoes.

3501
01:30:03,410 --> 01:30:03,641
You're,

3502
01:30:03,641 --> 01:30:03,980
you're,

3503
01:30:03,980 --> 01:30:06,680
I w I lift weights and do
everything else totally barefoot.

3504
01:30:07,550 --> 01:30:08,540
I just feel like a,

3505
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:10,220
or are we are like,

3506
01:30:10,490 --> 01:30:11,323
I like chucks,

3507
01:30:11,510 --> 01:30:12,530
converse all stars.

3508
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:12,770
Yeah,

3509
01:30:12,770 --> 01:30:13,603
those are good too.

3510
01:30:13,670 --> 01:30:14,430
Yeah,

3511
01:30:14,430 --> 01:30:15,020
because they don't,

3512
01:30:15,020 --> 01:30:15,853
they're just flat,

3513
01:30:16,490 --> 01:30:16,820
you know?

3514
01:30:16,820 --> 01:30:19,430
Those are good for lifting
weights sometimes if I want
like a little bit more,

3515
01:30:20,540 --> 01:30:21,950
but most of the time I do it barefoot.

3516
01:30:21,980 --> 01:30:24,590
I would say 99% of the
time I do it barefoot.

3517
01:30:25,160 --> 01:30:25,850
It's just,

3518
01:30:25,850 --> 01:30:27,020
I think it's just better for your feet,

3519
01:30:27,320 --> 01:30:28,153
you know?

3520
01:30:28,250 --> 01:30:31,940
I just think I'm the same thing when
I was saying with gloves and punching,

3521
01:30:32,630 --> 01:30:33,860
I've saying it's unnatural.

3522
01:30:33,890 --> 01:30:36,170
It's unnatural to have a bunch
of shit underneath your foot.

3523
01:30:36,290 --> 01:30:37,670
Your foot is not designed for that.

3524
01:30:38,930 --> 01:30:39,763
Yeah.

3525
01:30:41,390 --> 01:30:42,130
Yeah.

3526
01:30:42,130 --> 01:30:42,411
When you,

3527
01:30:42,411 --> 01:30:43,071
when you say that,

3528
01:30:43,071 --> 01:30:44,240
I start thinking about,

3529
01:30:44,810 --> 01:30:45,643
um,

3530
01:30:46,490 --> 01:30:51,490
how people I design and where people
are designed for and then write thoughts

3531
01:30:51,710 --> 01:30:52,580
and they go everywhere.

3532
01:30:52,610 --> 01:30:54,110
Sometimes my thoughts
like run into another,

3533
01:30:54,140 --> 01:30:54,261
hey,

3534
01:30:54,261 --> 01:30:55,041
that's a good idea.

3535
01:30:55,041 --> 01:30:55,940
Like he come together.

3536
01:30:56,020 --> 01:30:56,470
Right?

3537
01:30:56,470 --> 01:30:56,840
Um,

3538
01:30:56,840 --> 01:30:57,770
but when you say that,

3539
01:30:57,771 --> 01:31:01,280
I started thinking about when
we talk about changing your Dna,

3540
01:31:01,281 --> 01:31:02,900
where we started with the hookworm thing,

3541
01:31:03,260 --> 01:31:04,093
um,

3542
01:31:04,160 --> 01:31:05,060
and your feet,

3543
01:31:05,900 --> 01:31:10,900
if you take someone from an area that
is where they have to be agile and you

3544
01:31:11,391 --> 01:31:13,490
take them to a place where
you just have to be strong,

3545
01:31:13,491 --> 01:31:14,840
you take a child from,

3546
01:31:14,841 --> 01:31:17,930
from the Agile area and you make
him grow up in a strong area,

3547
01:31:17,931 --> 01:31:19,790
in an area where you have to be strong,

3548
01:31:19,820 --> 01:31:20,810
physically strong.

3549
01:31:21,290 --> 01:31:21,591
Does,

3550
01:31:21,591 --> 01:31:22,220
um,

3551
01:31:22,220 --> 01:31:26,150
how does that child fear in that
environment as he's going up,

3552
01:31:26,151 --> 01:31:27,110
does he adapt?

3553
01:31:28,070 --> 01:31:30,740
Not as fast as the people that
already have those traits,

3554
01:31:30,920 --> 01:31:33,350
but does he adapt and be able to survive?

3555
01:31:33,650 --> 01:31:34,970
And then can he go back to that,

3556
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:35,490
to,

3557
01:31:35,490 --> 01:31:37,640
to the agile lifestyle and with,

3558
01:31:37,641 --> 01:31:38,870
and take some of that strength?

3559
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:40,110
Depends on how many,

3560
01:31:40,110 --> 01:31:40,380
how big

3561
01:31:40,380 --> 01:31:41,210
he gets.

3562
01:31:41,210 --> 01:31:41,481
You know,

3563
01:31:41,481 --> 01:31:43,610
like if you were talking
like strong man strength,

3564
01:31:43,850 --> 01:31:46,040
those guys are not known for
their agility right there.

3565
01:31:46,041 --> 01:31:46,874
Giant.

3566
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:47,301
You know,

3567
01:31:47,301 --> 01:31:47,571
there's,

3568
01:31:47,571 --> 01:31:48,980
there's a trade off for sure.

3569
01:31:49,190 --> 01:31:50,510
There's a power trade off.

3570
01:31:50,840 --> 01:31:51,440
You know,

3571
01:31:51,440 --> 01:31:55,370
that's one of the things
it's so terrifying about
Francis in Ghana is that he's

3572
01:31:55,371 --> 01:31:56,600
270 lbs.

3573
01:31:56,601 --> 01:31:59,000
Cuts down to two 65 but he moves like a,

3574
01:31:59,530 --> 01:32:00,100
right?

3575
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:01,720
It's like he's not missing anything.

3576
01:32:01,870 --> 01:32:02,230
Like,

3577
01:32:02,230 --> 01:32:02,771
you know what I mean?

3578
01:32:02,771 --> 01:32:04,480
He's got ridiculous power,

3579
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:07,030
but he's also fast as fuck.

3580
01:32:07,240 --> 01:32:09,070
Like that left hook that
he hit over him with.

3581
01:32:09,071 --> 01:32:10,270
It's like Jesus,

3582
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:12,340
that's like a welterweights left hook,

3583
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:14,260
fat as fuck.

3584
01:32:14,740 --> 01:32:17,800
But he's hitting you
like a nuclear weapon.

3585
01:32:18,040 --> 01:32:21,160
It's just a different kind
of power on his punches,

3586
01:32:21,430 --> 01:32:23,110
a different kind of power in his body.

3587
01:32:23,260 --> 01:32:25,330
But he also has the ability to move fast,

3588
01:32:25,331 --> 01:32:26,380
like a smaller person.

3589
01:32:26,830 --> 01:32:29,200
Most of the time when you
get a really powerful person,

3590
01:32:29,201 --> 01:32:30,630
there's some sort of compromise.

3591
01:32:30,631 --> 01:32:31,341
It has to be made,

3592
01:32:31,341 --> 01:32:32,174
right?

3593
01:32:32,200 --> 01:32:32,550
And,

3594
01:32:32,550 --> 01:32:33,390
but what have you take?

3595
01:32:33,670 --> 01:32:38,670
What happens when a guy like Francis and
Gansu you develop his wrestling so that

3596
01:32:39,431 --> 01:32:42,190
it's like a Cain Velasquez.

3597
01:32:43,210 --> 01:32:45,490
Did you though at 33 like that's,

3598
01:32:45,491 --> 01:32:46,324
that's the problem.

3599
01:32:46,330 --> 01:32:46,990
Yeah.

3600
01:32:46,990 --> 01:32:47,680
I like,

3601
01:32:47,680 --> 01:32:48,011
you know,

3602
01:32:48,011 --> 01:32:48,844
and how much does he,

3603
01:32:49,150 --> 01:32:50,650
does he not like to wrestle?

3604
01:32:50,950 --> 01:32:53,920
Because that was the word that I had
heard is that he wasn't doing any

3605
01:32:53,980 --> 01:32:54,720
groundwork.

3606
01:32:54,720 --> 01:32:57,040
It was very little groundwork being done.

3607
01:32:57,190 --> 01:32:58,780
They were just trying to
keep the fight standing.

3608
01:32:59,080 --> 01:33:02,560
The problem with that is you
can't just do what you like to do.

3609
01:33:03,550 --> 01:33:05,540
You can't just do what you're awesome at.

3610
01:33:05,560 --> 01:33:08,080
He's already awesome it putting
people in another dimension.

3611
01:33:08,081 --> 01:33:08,470
Yeah.

3612
01:33:08,470 --> 01:33:10,570
I mean he hits harder than
anybody I've ever seen.

3613
01:33:10,571 --> 01:33:14,800
I've never seen anybody that hits his
heart is Francis and Ghana and that's that

3614
01:33:14,801 --> 01:33:16,150
power cube thing shows it.

3615
01:33:16,650 --> 01:33:16,901
I mean,

3616
01:33:16,901 --> 01:33:20,230
he got the highest registered
punched Tyrone spawn was number two.

3617
01:33:20,260 --> 01:33:25,210
His Punch was something like 10,000
pounds more power or more than,

3618
01:33:25,211 --> 01:33:26,470
than Tyrone spawns,

3619
01:33:26,740 --> 01:33:27,730
which is crazy.

3620
01:33:28,540 --> 01:33:30,550
He's a machine to be
allowed to hit people.

3621
01:33:30,610 --> 01:33:31,480
He's a monster.

3622
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:32,800
He's so powerful.

3623
01:33:32,920 --> 01:33:36,340
But it's like all things balance out,

3624
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:36,910
right?

3625
01:33:36,910 --> 01:33:38,080
Like Steve Paige just said,

3626
01:33:38,081 --> 01:33:38,470
Yep,

3627
01:33:38,470 --> 01:33:42,310
you're powerful for about five minutes
and I'm not going to be there for those

3628
01:33:42,311 --> 01:33:42,791
five minutes.

3629
01:33:42,791 --> 01:33:46,090
I'll be over here and I'll be over here
and I'll be ducking and getting the fuck

3630
01:33:46,091 --> 01:33:46,924
away from you.

3631
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:48,070
He took a few,

3632
01:33:48,220 --> 01:33:50,440
it takes a guy like Steve Bay that can,

3633
01:33:50,470 --> 01:33:54,130
is smart and fight smart
and knows the game,

3634
01:33:54,131 --> 01:33:56,440
like knows like you can't
keep this up with cane,

3635
01:33:56,441 --> 01:33:58,060
be able to do the same
thing name you would expect.

3636
01:33:58,061 --> 01:34:00,100
So it cane young Kane for sure.

3637
01:34:00,101 --> 01:34:01,700
Like the cane to fuck check Congo.

3638
01:34:02,380 --> 01:34:03,790
The cane have fought.

3639
01:34:04,300 --> 01:34:04,870
Um,

3640
01:34:04,870 --> 01:34:06,640
Ben Rothwell that cane,

3641
01:34:06,670 --> 01:34:08,170
she's just Christ that came,

3642
01:34:08,171 --> 01:34:09,340
could have done that to anybody.

3643
01:34:09,730 --> 01:34:14,730
But I think what you deal with with
Kane was like a mental strength that no

3644
01:34:15,131 --> 01:34:17,260
one's body can hold up to.

3645
01:34:17,290 --> 01:34:18,123
Yeah.

3646
01:34:18,130 --> 01:34:18,701
You know what I mean?

3647
01:34:18,701 --> 01:34:23,560
Like he just drove forward with so
much tenacity that his body is like,

3648
01:34:24,010 --> 01:34:28,870
tires are flying off and
bolts are breaking and it's
just too much strength in

3649
01:34:28,871 --> 01:34:29,704
the mind.

3650
01:34:30,100 --> 01:34:31,480
When you say that I picture,

3651
01:34:31,481 --> 01:34:34,090
I see it in my head and I
picture him moving forward a lot.

3652
01:34:34,091 --> 01:34:38,560
Like no Manga met off and lose a lot
just with better striking and what people

3653
01:34:38,561 --> 01:34:39,380
keep forgetting.

3654
01:34:39,380 --> 01:34:39,800
Never go.

3655
01:34:39,800 --> 01:34:41,590
Madoff was injury written as well.

3656
01:34:41,890 --> 01:34:44,250
He was constantly plagued
with a lot of guys at Ey.

3657
01:34:44,310 --> 01:34:44,680
Hey,

3658
01:34:44,680 --> 01:34:48,910
you know I had three or four of my UFC
fights because Josh Thompson got hurt.

3659
01:34:49,900 --> 01:34:50,733
You know,

3660
01:34:50,740 --> 01:34:51,311
I can think of,

3661
01:34:51,311 --> 01:34:52,840
I can think of off the top of my head.

3662
01:34:52,841 --> 01:34:55,930
Two of them were where it was
because Joshua was hurt and they,

3663
01:34:56,680 --> 01:34:57,800
what do you think about that?

3664
01:34:57,830 --> 01:34:58,070
Do you

3665
01:34:58,070 --> 01:35:02,870
think that they train too hard or do
you think that that is just the way you

3666
01:35:02,871 --> 01:35:03,880
have to train if you,

3667
01:35:03,881 --> 01:35:07,040
I mean you look at World Class Fighters,

3668
01:35:07,190 --> 01:35:09,200
Aka is one of the top gyms in the world.

3669
01:35:09,470 --> 01:35:10,490
Luke Rockhold,

3670
01:35:10,491 --> 01:35:11,510
Daniel Cormier,

3671
01:35:11,540 --> 01:35:12,620
Cain Velasquez,

3672
01:35:12,650 --> 01:35:13,550
Josh Thompson,

3673
01:35:13,730 --> 01:35:15,170
and you can keep going down the road.

3674
01:35:15,320 --> 01:35:19,580
There's a ton of like guys that people
haven't heard of that are top level

3675
01:35:19,581 --> 01:35:19,941
Neuroma,

3676
01:35:19,941 --> 01:35:20,390
Madoff,

3677
01:35:20,390 --> 01:35:24,530
obviously ton of guys also that a
train and out of there that are super,

3678
01:35:24,531 --> 01:35:25,490
super high level.

3679
01:35:25,491 --> 01:35:28,130
There's a big fucking
tank filled with sharks.

3680
01:35:28,790 --> 01:35:32,900
Now do you look at their success
and it's just undeniable.

3681
01:35:32,930 --> 01:35:37,310
They have incredible ratio of
success like world champions,

3682
01:35:37,640 --> 01:35:39,260
some of the best guys ever,

3683
01:35:39,800 --> 01:35:41,330
but a lot of injuries.

3684
01:35:41,370 --> 01:35:43,700
And was that just what happens
when you get both things?

3685
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:47,120
I believe especially with those
guys were those guys that concern.

3686
01:35:47,121 --> 01:35:52,121
It has to do with the number of quality
guys that they have that a fighting at

3687
01:35:52,251 --> 01:35:56,150
the same time and only they only
being so many hours in the day.

3688
01:35:56,420 --> 01:36:00,350
So they are in the gym at the same time
having to do the work that they need to

3689
01:36:00,351 --> 01:36:01,460
do to prepare for a fight.

3690
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,320
But they're all on the same.

3691
01:36:03,321 --> 01:36:05,030
Matt and guys were
running into each other,

3692
01:36:05,100 --> 01:36:05,630
right?

3693
01:36:05,630 --> 01:36:06,463
It's happening.

3694
01:36:06,610 --> 01:36:09,740
So Glueck is over here
and Khabib is over here,

3695
01:36:10,040 --> 01:36:13,610
but they've got five different
guys rotating for them.

3696
01:36:13,940 --> 01:36:18,940
And one of those five guys is is the
reason that no mag amount of gets hurt?

3697
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:20,280
No,

3698
01:36:20,280 --> 01:36:21,170
that's a problem,

3699
01:36:21,171 --> 01:36:21,710
right?

3700
01:36:21,710 --> 01:36:22,550
Like that doesn't have an,

3701
01:36:22,770 --> 01:36:26,230
and you never see worldclass boxers
sparring in the same ring as other world

3702
01:36:26,231 --> 01:36:27,350
costs bar same time,

3703
01:36:27,351 --> 01:36:27,801
same time.

3704
01:36:27,801 --> 01:36:28,460
It's stupid.

3705
01:36:28,460 --> 01:36:29,000
Yeah.

3706
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:34,000
That's a size issue in terms of the
gym size as definitely a thing in that,

3707
01:36:35,300 --> 01:36:36,200
in that regard.

3708
01:36:36,500 --> 01:36:37,010
Um,

3709
01:36:37,010 --> 01:36:39,200
also the,

3710
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:41,450
the layout of the gym,

3711
01:36:41,810 --> 01:36:42,261
you know,

3712
01:36:42,261 --> 01:36:43,240
like a boxing ring,

3713
01:36:43,241 --> 01:36:45,170
you could put them in
a quartered off area.

3714
01:36:45,420 --> 01:36:45,800
Right.

3715
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:47,540
And nobody else could be involved.

3716
01:36:47,620 --> 01:36:47,900
Right.

3717
01:36:47,900 --> 01:36:48,120
You,

3718
01:36:48,120 --> 01:36:49,550
you section off the mats,

3719
01:36:49,551 --> 01:36:51,320
but then you have to
have coaches in between.

3720
01:36:51,321 --> 01:36:52,041
People's will let,

3721
01:36:52,041 --> 01:36:53,540
when these guys starting to come together,

3722
01:36:53,541 --> 01:36:54,201
the coach comes in,

3723
01:36:54,201 --> 01:36:55,970
hey guys who start
going back to your area.

3724
01:36:56,250 --> 01:36:56,421
You know,

3725
01:36:56,421 --> 01:36:56,960
there's,

3726
01:36:56,960 --> 01:36:58,070
there's just no,

3727
01:36:58,310 --> 01:37:01,030
no borders and without having borders and,

3728
01:37:01,031 --> 01:37:02,550
and a guy like Hector Lumbar,

3729
01:37:02,551 --> 01:37:03,384
I'd come in after me.

3730
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:04,131
You know,

3731
01:37:04,131 --> 01:37:04,401
you're,

3732
01:37:04,401 --> 01:37:04,641
you're,

3733
01:37:04,641 --> 01:37:04,911
you're,

3734
01:37:04,911 --> 01:37:05,810
you're gonna move.

3735
01:37:06,160 --> 01:37:06,840
Yeah.

3736
01:37:06,840 --> 01:37:08,000
In a crash into people.

3737
01:37:08,300 --> 01:37:09,133
Yeah.

3738
01:37:09,250 --> 01:37:09,440
Yeah.

3739
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:10,730
I think that's a real good point.

3740
01:37:10,910 --> 01:37:12,380
I think it's the level of talent,

3741
01:37:12,710 --> 01:37:14,000
the aggression in the room,

3742
01:37:14,030 --> 01:37:16,130
the level of ambition in the room,

3743
01:37:16,970 --> 01:37:17,803
all of the above.

3744
01:37:17,930 --> 01:37:20,720
And the fact that they have
that philosophy to just go hard.

3745
01:37:20,930 --> 01:37:21,763
I mean they go hard.

3746
01:37:21,890 --> 01:37:22,440
Yeah.

3747
01:37:22,440 --> 01:37:26,060
Like I talked to DC about and he's like
sometimes Kane and I spar and sometimes

3748
01:37:26,061 --> 01:37:26,750
we fight.

3749
01:37:26,750 --> 01:37:27,500
Yeah.

3750
01:37:27,500 --> 01:37:27,921
I'm like,

3751
01:37:27,921 --> 01:37:28,970
God damn.

3752
01:37:29,540 --> 01:37:31,280
You know you have a
fight before the fight,

3753
01:37:31,281 --> 01:37:32,240
like legitimate,

3754
01:37:32,241 --> 01:37:33,200
full on,

3755
01:37:33,710 --> 01:37:34,280
you know,

3756
01:37:34,280 --> 01:37:37,430
fights that happened
or shots that happens.

3757
01:37:37,460 --> 01:37:37,820
Yeah.

3758
01:37:37,820 --> 01:37:38,950
I remember being um,

3759
01:37:38,990 --> 01:37:43,990
being underneath t bow trying to come
to my feet and he stole big punches with

3760
01:37:44,061 --> 01:37:44,900
little gloves on.

3761
01:37:44,990 --> 01:37:45,240
Right.

3762
01:37:45,240 --> 01:37:46,130
We're wearing a little gloves,

3763
01:37:46,131 --> 01:37:46,690
spying and,

3764
01:37:46,690 --> 01:37:49,130
and make gloves and he's hitting me and
hitting me in the face like three times

3765
01:37:49,131 --> 01:37:49,964
and I'm like,

3766
01:37:50,150 --> 01:37:51,650
that's entirely too hot.

3767
01:37:52,250 --> 01:37:53,061
But if I don't get up,

3768
01:37:53,061 --> 01:37:54,020
he's just going to keep going.

3769
01:37:55,890 --> 01:37:56,540
Right.

3770
01:37:56,540 --> 01:37:57,750
But like that's what it is,

3771
01:37:57,751 --> 01:37:58,051
man.

3772
01:37:58,051 --> 01:38:00,690
When you're in the gym there
some guys that they just,

3773
01:38:00,750 --> 01:38:01,583
they just,

3774
01:38:01,740 --> 01:38:06,740
they only have one speed and a lot of
those guys are the guys that could perform

3775
01:38:06,781 --> 01:38:08,670
when it's time to step into the cage.

3776
01:38:08,760 --> 01:38:09,121
You know,

3777
01:38:09,121 --> 01:38:09,930
who does the story?

3778
01:38:09,930 --> 01:38:10,860
Tj Dillashaw,

3779
01:38:11,190 --> 01:38:13,020
all the Alpha male guys
were saying that Tj,

3780
01:38:13,021 --> 01:38:16,590
when he was bar would spar real hard and
then when you would hurt him he tried

3781
01:38:16,591 --> 01:38:17,250
to kill you.

3782
01:38:17,250 --> 01:38:17,640
Yeah.

3783
01:38:17,640 --> 01:38:19,080
You know just how we go.

3784
01:38:19,140 --> 01:38:19,973
But look,

3785
01:38:20,130 --> 01:38:22,860
it's a fucking world champion
for a reason to time.

3786
01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:25,380
You know that that tenacity,

3787
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:26,280
you know,

3788
01:38:26,280 --> 01:38:30,090
that makes you a sometimes a
problematic sparring partner.

3789
01:38:30,450 --> 01:38:33,240
That same mental strength and who knows
who's telling the truth because this is

3790
01:38:33,241 --> 01:38:34,350
obviously alpha male.

3791
01:38:34,351 --> 01:38:36,900
They were a little salty
after he left and you know,

3792
01:38:36,901 --> 01:38:38,040
I don't think they're lying,

3793
01:38:38,041 --> 01:38:38,874
but I think there's two,

3794
01:38:39,390 --> 01:38:40,230
two sides of the story.

3795
01:38:40,260 --> 01:38:41,400
There's two sides of the story.

3796
01:38:41,401 --> 01:38:42,450
And there's also,

3797
01:38:42,480 --> 01:38:42,990
you know,

3798
01:38:42,990 --> 01:38:45,270
people accentuate their position.

3799
01:38:45,990 --> 01:38:46,471
Yeah.

3800
01:38:46,471 --> 01:38:47,304
I mean if you get,

3801
01:38:47,310 --> 01:38:49,860
if you watch a video
versus hearing two people,

3802
01:38:49,861 --> 01:38:50,640
they'll a story,

3803
01:38:50,640 --> 01:38:50,910
right?

3804
01:38:50,910 --> 01:38:52,140
You see three different things.

3805
01:38:52,170 --> 01:38:52,771
Yeah Man,

3806
01:38:52,771 --> 01:38:54,150
I've had people tell me things like,

3807
01:38:54,151 --> 01:38:54,391
man,

3808
01:38:54,391 --> 01:38:55,410
you won't believe what happened.

3809
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:56,221
And then I watched the video.

3810
01:38:56,221 --> 01:38:56,491
I'm like,

3811
01:38:56,491 --> 01:38:57,000
wait a minute.

3812
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:58,410
What did you think you saw?

3813
01:38:58,800 --> 01:38:59,820
Cause I didn't see that.

3814
01:38:59,850 --> 01:39:00,300
I saw it.

3815
01:39:00,300 --> 01:39:01,650
I saw something pretty reasonable.

3816
01:39:02,240 --> 01:39:04,620
But when these guys go back and
watch fights and they're like,

3817
01:39:04,650 --> 01:39:05,550
I won that flight.

3818
01:39:05,640 --> 01:39:06,300
Yeah.

3819
01:39:06,300 --> 01:39:06,540
Like,

3820
01:39:06,540 --> 01:39:07,373
no you didn't.

3821
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:08,670
That's a real problem.

3822
01:39:08,940 --> 01:39:09,620
Yeah.

3823
01:39:09,620 --> 01:39:10,260
Look,

3824
01:39:10,260 --> 01:39:10,710
some,

3825
01:39:10,710 --> 01:39:11,431
some people,

3826
01:39:11,431 --> 01:39:14,280
and again those are really
the same guise as the,

3827
01:39:14,281 --> 01:39:15,690
I can't catch a break guys.

3828
01:39:15,990 --> 01:39:19,110
The ones who think they won when no one
else thinks they won Washington like,

3829
01:39:19,111 --> 01:39:19,531
hey man,

3830
01:39:19,531 --> 01:39:20,670
what fight are you watching?

3831
01:39:21,180 --> 01:39:22,380
Like you definitely didn't win.

3832
01:39:23,550 --> 01:39:24,330
Look at your,

3833
01:39:24,330 --> 01:39:25,230
but your face.

3834
01:39:25,260 --> 01:39:26,070
Yeah,

3835
01:39:26,070 --> 01:39:27,900
the fucking judges man.

3836
01:39:28,160 --> 01:39:30,330
That that is really
the number one problem.

3837
01:39:30,331 --> 01:39:31,770
If all the rules,

3838
01:39:31,771 --> 01:39:32,700
all of these different things,

3839
01:39:32,701 --> 01:39:33,780
those are all problem.

3840
01:39:34,290 --> 01:39:36,780
The judges or the biggest problem by far,

3841
01:39:36,810 --> 01:39:37,590
like every,

3842
01:39:37,590 --> 01:39:39,000
it seems like every UFC,

3843
01:39:39,270 --> 01:39:40,820
I'm waiting to interview the fighter.

3844
01:39:40,830 --> 01:39:45,830
I'm in the cage in there reading the
scorecards and I just go like every UFC

3845
01:39:46,591 --> 01:39:48,870
it's like one fight at
least while I'm like,

3846
01:39:48,871 --> 01:39:49,704
what?

3847
01:39:50,190 --> 01:39:54,090
What the fuck did they just say 30 27 who?

3848
01:39:54,630 --> 01:39:56,100
How what?

3849
01:39:56,420 --> 01:39:58,290
Like it guys getting their asses kicked,

3850
01:39:58,291 --> 01:39:59,310
taken down,

3851
01:39:59,460 --> 01:40:01,650
getting fucked up on the feet
and they're winning rounds.

3852
01:40:01,651 --> 01:40:03,640
30 27 yeah.

3853
01:40:03,990 --> 01:40:04,621
Ten nine,

3854
01:40:04,621 --> 01:40:05,910
ten nine ten nine.

3855
01:40:05,940 --> 01:40:07,560
What the,

3856
01:40:07,561 --> 01:40:08,640
I've seen that I saw,

3857
01:40:08,641 --> 01:40:10,650
I saw a fight recently.

3858
01:40:10,651 --> 01:40:11,640
I can't remember what it was,

3859
01:40:11,641 --> 01:40:12,031
but when,

3860
01:40:12,031 --> 01:40:13,530
when the judging came up,

3861
01:40:13,800 --> 01:40:14,461
I heard 30,

3862
01:40:14,461 --> 01:40:15,810
27 and I was like,

3863
01:40:15,811 --> 01:40:18,650
there was no guarantee that
any guy won any of those.

3864
01:40:18,810 --> 01:40:19,643
Oh,

3865
01:40:19,800 --> 01:40:20,460
sorry.

3866
01:40:20,460 --> 01:40:22,050
There was a guarantee when I heard 30,

3867
01:40:22,051 --> 01:40:24,030
27 I thought this guy
one because I'm like,

3868
01:40:24,031 --> 01:40:25,110
he won that round.

3869
01:40:25,290 --> 01:40:26,700
So they thought he will know that too,

3870
01:40:27,180 --> 01:40:27,541
you know?

3871
01:40:27,541 --> 01:40:29,130
And then they gave it to
the other guy and I'm like,

3872
01:40:29,580 --> 01:40:30,301
how does that,

3873
01:40:30,301 --> 01:40:31,920
how did he lose that one round?

3874
01:40:31,980 --> 01:40:33,330
It's full incompetence,

3875
01:40:33,420 --> 01:40:33,870
man.

3876
01:40:33,870 --> 01:40:35,190
It's just fallen competence.

3877
01:40:35,340 --> 01:40:35,641
Is it,

3878
01:40:35,641 --> 01:40:37,200
what is it like now when you are,

3879
01:40:37,380 --> 01:40:42,380
you're working for UFC and you're doing
the Fox stuff like Fox coverage of UFC,

3880
01:40:43,200 --> 01:40:44,033
um,

3881
01:40:44,040 --> 01:40:44,970
d do you,

3882
01:40:45,030 --> 01:40:49,620
do you have like a set schedule?

3883
01:40:49,621 --> 01:40:50,880
Like how often do you guys do it?

3884
01:40:51,240 --> 01:40:52,073
Um,

3885
01:40:52,170 --> 01:40:54,130
so there are like seven,

3886
01:40:54,260 --> 01:40:55,540
actually there were seven when I started.

3887
01:40:55,541 --> 01:40:59,140
I think there are more guys
now in that rotation and um,

3888
01:41:00,400 --> 01:41:01,720
you don't have a set schedule.

3889
01:41:02,050 --> 01:41:02,883
Um,

3890
01:41:02,890 --> 01:41:03,730
so they just call you up,

3891
01:41:03,731 --> 01:41:04,564
hey,

3892
01:41:04,770 --> 01:41:05,603
Thursday.

3893
01:41:05,890 --> 01:41:06,880
Well they give it,

3894
01:41:06,910 --> 01:41:09,110
they give it to you a few weeks out yet.

3895
01:41:09,550 --> 01:41:10,720
Plenty of advanced notice.

3896
01:41:10,721 --> 01:41:12,370
So like the next desk job.

3897
01:41:12,371 --> 01:41:13,204
I'm working,

3898
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:15,160
I'm is the Barbosa Lee fight.

3899
01:41:15,850 --> 01:41:16,570
Which one is that?

3900
01:41:16,570 --> 01:41:18,280
That's on the 21st of April.

3901
01:41:18,340 --> 01:41:18,611
April.

3902
01:41:18,611 --> 01:41:18,970
Okay.

3903
01:41:18,970 --> 01:41:19,271
Oh,

3904
01:41:19,271 --> 01:41:21,880
I think that's Atlantic city and hard.

3905
01:41:21,910 --> 01:41:22,390
Yeah,

3906
01:41:22,390 --> 01:41:26,040
that's a Frankie Edgar's fighting
who's hubs once cubs won.

3907
01:41:27,670 --> 01:41:29,650
So about that fight.

3908
01:41:30,940 --> 01:41:33,430
I don't like to fight.

3909
01:41:33,880 --> 01:41:34,360
I don't,

3910
01:41:34,360 --> 01:41:35,830
I don't have a problem with it.

3911
01:41:35,831 --> 01:41:38,470
Like I feel like Frankie
just got knocked out.

3912
01:41:38,620 --> 01:41:39,220
Yup.

3913
01:41:39,220 --> 01:41:40,720
And that's really soon to come back.

3914
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:43,330
If anybody can bounce back
from something like that.

3915
01:41:43,360 --> 01:41:44,440
It's a guy like Frankie,

3916
01:41:44,860 --> 01:41:49,120
but I felt the same way about Bisbing
fighting after he didn't get knocked out

3917
01:41:49,121 --> 01:41:51,700
and get dropped by George and
they got choked unconscious.

3918
01:41:51,970 --> 01:41:52,361
He's like,

3919
01:41:52,361 --> 01:41:52,481
yeah,

3920
01:41:52,481 --> 01:41:53,350
you shouldn't take that gas.

3921
01:41:53,351 --> 01:41:54,080
No fight so soon.

3922
01:41:54,080 --> 01:41:54,580
Yep.

3923
01:41:54,580 --> 01:41:55,413
Completely agree.

3924
01:41:55,600 --> 01:42:00,130
And I feel that way about this flight
because I feel like Frankie wants this

3925
01:42:00,131 --> 01:42:02,590
fight because he wants to get
that taste out of his mouth.

3926
01:42:03,110 --> 01:42:03,943
Um,

3927
01:42:03,970 --> 01:42:04,870
but like,

3928
01:42:04,871 --> 01:42:06,100
it's still going to taste the same.

3929
01:42:06,220 --> 01:42:07,900
Anytime you go back and watch that fight,

3930
01:42:07,901 --> 01:42:09,580
you still gonna have those feelings,

3931
01:42:09,610 --> 01:42:10,140
right?

3932
01:42:10,140 --> 01:42:10,410
You,

3933
01:42:10,410 --> 01:42:11,800
you're going to win your next fight,

3934
01:42:11,801 --> 01:42:13,600
more than likely your Frankie Edgar,

3935
01:42:14,250 --> 01:42:15,190
you don't have to rush it.

3936
01:42:15,580 --> 01:42:15,941
Like,

3937
01:42:15,941 --> 01:42:18,120
let your brain rest recover.

3938
01:42:18,170 --> 01:42:19,480
That's how I feel about it.

3939
01:42:19,660 --> 01:42:22,210
But that's only because I'm 41.

3940
01:42:22,211 --> 01:42:22,710
Now.

3941
01:42:22,710 --> 01:42:23,060
If I,

3942
01:42:23,060 --> 01:42:23,980
if I was 26,

3943
01:42:24,220 --> 01:42:25,053
maybe I would have been,

3944
01:42:25,090 --> 01:42:26,650
and I know Frankie's like 32,

3945
01:42:26,680 --> 01:42:27,240
33,

3946
01:42:27,240 --> 01:42:28,073
36,

3947
01:42:28,150 --> 01:42:29,140
[inaudible] 36,

3948
01:42:29,190 --> 01:42:30,090
I think he's 36.

3949
01:42:30,700 --> 01:42:31,840
Find out for us.

3950
01:42:32,500 --> 01:42:33,340
I'm pretty sure Frankie,

3951
01:42:33,341 --> 01:42:34,120
36.

3952
01:42:34,120 --> 01:42:35,230
But I'm like,

3953
01:42:35,590 --> 01:42:37,570
you want to go out there and do it.

3954
01:42:37,571 --> 01:42:42,571
But when I think about brain trauma
and your things that I forget,

3955
01:42:43,871 --> 01:42:45,760
I'm always like my cds flaring up.

3956
01:42:45,900 --> 01:42:46,733
Yeah.

3957
01:42:47,100 --> 01:42:47,440
Yeah.

3958
01:42:47,440 --> 01:42:47,890
Well,

3959
01:42:47,890 --> 01:42:48,723
um,

3960
01:42:49,270 --> 01:42:49,781
you know,

3961
01:42:49,781 --> 01:42:54,550
he fought cub just a couple of years
ago in Malden and got a last second

3962
01:42:54,551 --> 01:42:55,384
submission.

3963
01:42:55,660 --> 01:42:56,710
Maybe he just thinks,

3964
01:42:56,711 --> 01:42:58,480
look Danish fucking thing in the world.

3965
01:42:58,481 --> 01:42:59,740
This guy can do to stop me.

3966
01:43:00,090 --> 01:43:00,430
Yeah.

3967
01:43:00,430 --> 01:43:01,110
You know,

3968
01:43:01,110 --> 01:43:02,110
I fucked him up before.

3969
01:43:02,111 --> 01:43:03,220
I'm going to fuck him up again.

3970
01:43:03,250 --> 01:43:03,851
It doesn't matter.

3971
01:43:03,851 --> 01:43:04,780
I'm not even going to get hit,

3972
01:43:04,810 --> 01:43:05,680
I'm just going to get ahold of them.

3973
01:43:05,681 --> 01:43:07,240
Ragdoll I'm just like I did before.

3974
01:43:07,870 --> 01:43:10,390
But Cub Swanson King Crack,

3975
01:43:10,540 --> 01:43:14,860
he can crack and he's got a kid now and
he's got a second kid along the way and

3976
01:43:14,861 --> 01:43:15,730
that doesn't quit,

3977
01:43:15,890 --> 01:43:17,770
does not quit and that
makes dude's hungry.

3978
01:43:18,070 --> 01:43:23,070
And that fight is probably a massive
motivating factor for the cubs.

3979
01:43:23,530 --> 01:43:24,070
And He,

3980
01:43:24,070 --> 01:43:27,130
there's a cub is cub is
still around and cubs,

3981
01:43:27,170 --> 01:43:31,390
he's still number four because he
tastes the lessons from these fights.

3982
01:43:31,630 --> 01:43:33,490
He learned something in
that fight with Frankie.

3983
01:43:33,910 --> 01:43:35,380
I can't see that fight going.

3984
01:43:35,410 --> 01:43:38,440
I mean there's a part of me that can
see that if I go in exactly the same the

3985
01:43:38,441 --> 01:43:39,160
same way,

3986
01:43:39,160 --> 01:43:43,150
but I can also see cub having made
adjustments because of the lessons that he

3987
01:43:43,151 --> 01:43:44,120
learned from that or

3988
01:43:44,240 --> 01:43:46,930
am noon and he had to learn
from the tiger fight as well.

3989
01:43:47,090 --> 01:43:48,970
Look at how we're taking
a handled Frankie.

3990
01:43:49,510 --> 01:43:51,010
He handled him very smart,

3991
01:43:51,560 --> 01:43:52,220
very creative,

3992
01:43:52,220 --> 01:43:53,600
mean cub fight a different way.

3993
01:43:53,601 --> 01:43:57,500
COBB is more of an in and out guy
and he explodes on Ya and you know,

3994
01:43:57,501 --> 01:44:00,460
he keeps his hands down
low and sneak shots on you.

3995
01:44:00,500 --> 01:44:02,930
He does a lot of weird shit cubs.

3996
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:04,040
He's real creative.

3997
01:44:04,041 --> 01:44:05,570
He's got to watch out for the take down.

3998
01:44:05,571 --> 01:44:06,950
And the wrestling control though,

3999
01:44:06,951 --> 01:44:09,170
cause that that's a big
factor in the fight.

4000
01:44:09,200 --> 01:44:10,010
That was giant.

4001
01:44:10,010 --> 01:44:11,120
That's where he got controlled.

4002
01:44:11,690 --> 01:44:13,820
But I mean it's a great fight.

4003
01:44:13,850 --> 01:44:14,683
I just,

4004
01:44:15,110 --> 01:44:15,531
again,

4005
01:44:15,531 --> 01:44:15,891
I'm just,

4006
01:44:15,891 --> 01:44:17,450
I'm just all about what's better,

4007
01:44:17,451 --> 01:44:18,590
what's better in the long run,

4008
01:44:18,591 --> 01:44:19,010
right.

4009
01:44:19,010 --> 01:44:19,460
You know.

4010
01:44:19,460 --> 01:44:20,900
Well it's Toms River.

4011
01:44:21,230 --> 01:44:25,220
The problem is a New Jersey and this is
going to be in Atlantic city and all the

4012
01:44:25,221 --> 01:44:27,230
boys are going to come down and yeah,

4013
01:44:27,320 --> 01:44:30,650
I'm with you 100% I would
like to see this fight,

4014
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:32,660
but I would like to see
this fight in six months.

4015
01:44:32,690 --> 01:44:33,230
Yeah.

4016
01:44:33,230 --> 01:44:33,650
Yeah.

4017
01:44:33,650 --> 01:44:34,580
I mean it's a good fight.

4018
01:44:35,070 --> 01:44:37,610
It's good funny for a Frankie could walk,

4019
01:44:37,611 --> 01:44:41,750
fought Frankie go in there and wipe them
out or do exactly what he did last time

4020
01:44:42,050 --> 01:44:44,060
or it can be a battle and
then nothing comes of it.

4021
01:44:44,061 --> 01:44:44,960
But it's just like,

4022
01:44:45,350 --> 01:44:48,530
I'm like err on the side of caution
and some good fights on this card man.

4023
01:44:48,700 --> 01:44:49,220
Yup.

4024
01:44:49,220 --> 01:44:51,260
David Branch and Tiago Santos.

4025
01:44:51,320 --> 01:44:51,591
I'm the,

4026
01:44:51,591 --> 01:44:56,591
I'm looking forward to that one tricky
fucking fight that Tiago Santos guy is a

4027
01:44:56,751 --> 01:45:01,090
marker that dye that dude
crushes people and he um,

4028
01:45:01,130 --> 01:45:02,890
ever since has lost the spice Lee.

4029
01:45:02,891 --> 01:45:03,680
He's been like,

4030
01:45:03,680 --> 01:45:05,000
it seemed more focused.

4031
01:45:05,001 --> 01:45:06,140
He's a fucking animal man.

4032
01:45:06,170 --> 01:45:10,460
Very dangerous striker and David Branch
coming off of that performance against

4033
01:45:10,461 --> 01:45:11,121
Luke Rockhold.

4034
01:45:11,121 --> 01:45:16,121
He had Brock hold her know he had rock
hold her and you know he wound up getting

4035
01:45:16,431 --> 01:45:17,264
dominated,

4036
01:45:17,430 --> 01:45:19,550
wound up getting mounted and beaten down.

4037
01:45:19,550 --> 01:45:21,320
Got his back taken and smashed.

4038
01:45:21,321 --> 01:45:24,440
But he learned a lesson in
that flight too for sure.

4039
01:45:24,710 --> 01:45:27,170
You'll learn a lot about
conditioning when you fight.

4040
01:45:27,171 --> 01:45:32,171
A guy like Rockhold to Rockhold is
one of the best in the division at top

4041
01:45:32,211 --> 01:45:32,960
control.

4042
01:45:32,960 --> 01:45:35,300
He gets on top of Dude's like
what he did with Chris Weidman,

4043
01:45:35,550 --> 01:45:37,460
five minutes off stud wrestler.

4044
01:45:37,850 --> 01:45:41,020
He gets on top of him and it's like he
might as well how to building setting on

4045
01:45:41,021 --> 01:45:41,150
him.

4046
01:45:41,150 --> 01:45:44,080
He has his body type is,

4047
01:45:44,100 --> 01:45:44,540
is,

4048
01:45:44,540 --> 01:45:49,310
is something that high to deal
with with just how long he is,

4049
01:45:49,311 --> 01:45:53,360
but how good he is at Jujitsu
and the controls and positioning.

4050
01:45:53,720 --> 01:45:54,770
That's a problem man,

4051
01:45:54,771 --> 01:45:55,070
when you,

4052
01:45:55,070 --> 01:45:57,410
because you have to
make that extra effort,

4053
01:45:57,710 --> 01:45:58,071
you know,

4054
01:45:58,071 --> 01:45:59,480
when you start hip escaping,

4055
01:45:59,750 --> 01:46:00,070
um,

4056
01:46:00,070 --> 01:46:00,290
and,

4057
01:46:00,290 --> 01:46:02,270
and on a regular guy,

4058
01:46:02,390 --> 01:46:03,590
the guy that you're comfortable with,

4059
01:46:03,591 --> 01:46:04,424
the size,

4060
01:46:04,520 --> 01:46:04,910
you know,

4061
01:46:04,910 --> 01:46:07,820
you don't have to make as
the movements for as long.

4062
01:46:08,180 --> 01:46:09,013
But Luke,

4063
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:13,670
his build and the way he is and
his understanding of positioning,

4064
01:46:13,850 --> 01:46:15,080
that's a hard,

4065
01:46:15,140 --> 01:46:16,940
he's a hide out for a lot of guys.

4066
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:17,271
Yeah,

4067
01:46:17,271 --> 01:46:21,620
he's got that Heidrick
Gracie type body long strong.

4068
01:46:21,670 --> 01:46:21,820
It's,

4069
01:46:21,820 --> 01:46:22,011
it's,

4070
01:46:22,011 --> 01:46:22,641
it's weird.

4071
01:46:22,641 --> 01:46:23,630
It's just different.

4072
01:46:23,631 --> 01:46:26,860
It's like when I first rolled
with like those guys over the,

4073
01:46:27,130 --> 01:46:29,360
the judo guys like them Bursey Madigan,

4074
01:46:29,361 --> 01:46:31,550
Berrien and Carl and those guys,

4075
01:46:31,790 --> 01:46:33,320
I roll with them and it's like there,

4076
01:46:33,350 --> 01:46:35,480
they have this Jujitsu style that's like,

4077
01:46:35,481 --> 01:46:39,890
the timing is just off of beat somehow
and the hitting all these cameras and

4078
01:46:39,891 --> 01:46:40,251
it's like,

4079
01:46:40,251 --> 01:46:40,700
it's,

4080
01:46:40,700 --> 01:46:41,780
it feels funky.

4081
01:46:41,781 --> 01:46:46,280
I feel like that's how Rockhold his
body has Cody Mckinsey was like that.

4082
01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:47,090
Um,

4083
01:46:47,090 --> 01:46:48,130
when I thought Cody,

4084
01:46:48,270 --> 01:46:48,960
I was like,

4085
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:50,190
I'm really good at escaping

4086
01:46:50,190 --> 01:46:52,860
back control and I peel
them off and it's like,

4087
01:46:53,330 --> 01:46:53,690
fucking,

4088
01:46:53,690 --> 01:46:55,140
it's so how much leg do you have?

4089
01:46:55,630 --> 01:46:56,010
A,

4090
01:46:56,010 --> 01:46:56,611
you know what I mean?

4091
01:46:56,611 --> 01:46:57,540
It's just keeps going.

4092
01:46:57,870 --> 01:46:58,530
Yeah.

4093
01:46:58,530 --> 01:46:58,921
Yeah.

4094
01:46:58,921 --> 01:47:03,720
Well that's what makes the Yoel Romero
fight all the more impressive that your

4095
01:47:03,750 --> 01:47:05,650
Merrill shut that shit down a tire.

4096
01:47:05,651 --> 01:47:06,484
Lee.

4097
01:47:06,630 --> 01:47:08,010
He's terrifying man.

4098
01:47:08,280 --> 01:47:09,510
But he's seen everything,

4099
01:47:09,511 --> 01:47:09,960
right?

4100
01:47:09,960 --> 01:47:12,750
Like wrestling all the
best guys in the world.

4101
01:47:12,780 --> 01:47:13,591
Did you see the podcast?

4102
01:47:13,591 --> 01:47:14,610
I did with him and Joey Diaz.

4103
01:47:14,630 --> 01:47:16,050
I watched some of it and I,

4104
01:47:16,230 --> 01:47:16,591
I was,

4105
01:47:16,591 --> 01:47:18,810
I like to listen to your
stuff when I'm going to bed,

4106
01:47:19,350 --> 01:47:19,980
but like,

4107
01:47:19,980 --> 01:47:21,740
so it's all in my head
sometimes when I fall it,

4108
01:47:21,741 --> 01:47:23,610
when I pass out and I was in Texas,

4109
01:47:23,611 --> 01:47:24,870
I was driving all the time.

4110
01:47:24,871 --> 01:47:25,561
So I would listen.

4111
01:47:25,561 --> 01:47:26,120
When I leave,

4112
01:47:26,120 --> 01:47:27,870
I leave Austin drive to Houston.

4113
01:47:28,020 --> 01:47:30,750
I would hear like two or three episodes
because I can go in there and then

4114
01:47:30,751 --> 01:47:33,900
coming back I said three hours or two
and a half hour drive each way right out

4115
01:47:33,901 --> 01:47:34,111
here.

4116
01:47:34,111 --> 01:47:35,250
I'm not in the car as much,

4117
01:47:35,340 --> 01:47:35,820
so I,

4118
01:47:35,820 --> 01:47:36,181
I get,

4119
01:47:36,181 --> 01:47:37,740
I get a lot of snippets.

4120
01:47:37,770 --> 01:47:38,010
Right.

4121
01:47:38,010 --> 01:47:40,160
So I got some of some of the Yeoman mail,

4122
01:47:40,200 --> 01:47:41,530
but I haven't got the whole episode.

4123
01:47:41,610 --> 01:47:44,010
He was talking about the program,

4124
01:47:44,011 --> 01:47:45,450
the rest of the program coming up in it.

4125
01:47:45,480 --> 01:47:46,980
What it was like amazing.

4126
01:47:47,250 --> 01:47:47,850
Yeah,

4127
01:47:47,850 --> 01:47:48,600
I heard,

4128
01:47:48,600 --> 01:47:50,010
I heard some of that about how,

4129
01:47:50,011 --> 01:47:50,844
um,

4130
01:47:50,850 --> 01:47:51,151
you know,

4131
01:47:51,151 --> 01:47:54,440
they're on a pyramid and they,

4132
01:47:55,460 --> 01:47:57,810
what was it that the top guys,

4133
01:47:57,811 --> 01:47:58,650
they get the best.

4134
01:47:58,710 --> 01:48:00,120
They get in some of the best food,

4135
01:48:00,121 --> 01:48:00,751
the best food,

4136
01:48:00,751 --> 01:48:01,584
the best.

4137
01:48:02,340 --> 01:48:03,570
They get three meals a day.

4138
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:05,810
The other guy was get to yeah.

4139
01:48:05,880 --> 01:48:09,630
Like everything's better and they're
all working out with each other all the

4140
01:48:09,631 --> 01:48:09,961
time.

4141
01:48:09,961 --> 01:48:12,180
So they're all around each other
all the time and he's like,

4142
01:48:12,181 --> 01:48:13,530
everybody knows you hurt your wrist.

4143
01:48:13,560 --> 01:48:14,370
Oh,

4144
01:48:14,370 --> 01:48:14,971
everybody knows.

4145
01:48:14,971 --> 01:48:16,470
And those are the guys you're
going to have to go against.

4146
01:48:16,471 --> 01:48:17,100
Yeah.

4147
01:48:17,100 --> 01:48:17,580
Yeah.

4148
01:48:17,580 --> 01:48:17,851
That,

4149
01:48:17,851 --> 01:48:18,271
see that.

4150
01:48:18,271 --> 01:48:21,060
See that that is a
representation of capitalism.

4151
01:48:21,330 --> 01:48:21,960
Yeah.

4152
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:22,350
Right,

4153
01:48:22,350 --> 01:48:22,740
right.

4154
01:48:22,740 --> 01:48:24,200
It is exactly what it is.

4155
01:48:24,210 --> 01:48:26,040
It is capitalism inside of communism.

4156
01:48:26,280 --> 01:48:27,113
Yeah,

4157
01:48:27,310 --> 01:48:27,810
no,

4158
01:48:27,810 --> 01:48:28,370
yeah.

4159
01:48:28,370 --> 01:48:32,160
But key people poor and hungry
and like the best in the world,

4160
01:48:32,310 --> 01:48:34,080
the best they can do is
get three meals a day.

4161
01:48:34,110 --> 01:48:34,770
Right.

4162
01:48:34,770 --> 01:48:35,880
And live in a better place.

4163
01:48:36,190 --> 01:48:37,023
That's

4164
01:48:38,600 --> 01:48:39,433
how we got,

4165
01:48:39,690 --> 01:48:40,740
we got political.

4166
01:48:40,890 --> 01:48:41,041
Yeah.

4167
01:48:41,041 --> 01:48:42,740
But it is political and it,

4168
01:48:42,780 --> 01:48:43,613
you know,

4169
01:48:43,650 --> 01:48:44,910
people need motivation.

4170
01:48:45,090 --> 01:48:47,040
They need incentive for your actions.

4171
01:48:47,160 --> 01:48:49,230
People that think
socialism is a good idea,

4172
01:48:49,560 --> 01:48:50,820
have never accomplished anything.

4173
01:48:51,120 --> 01:48:52,650
There's no way you've competed.

4174
01:48:52,710 --> 01:48:53,543
There's no way.

4175
01:48:53,790 --> 01:48:57,060
If you're a competitor and you
understand the benefit and the value of

4176
01:48:57,061 --> 01:48:57,571
competition,

4177
01:48:57,571 --> 01:48:59,460
I'm not talking about
capitalism competitive,

4178
01:48:59,730 --> 01:49:02,490
I'm talking about just actual
competitive in anything.

4179
01:49:02,520 --> 01:49:02,790
Yeah.

4180
01:49:02,790 --> 01:49:06,690
Anything where you're trying to get
a position and it's a very difficult

4181
01:49:06,691 --> 01:49:07,051
position.

4182
01:49:07,051 --> 01:49:08,650
So you want to work harder than
the other people around you.

4183
01:49:08,651 --> 01:49:11,850
You know about merit based performance.

4184
01:49:12,120 --> 01:49:12,700
Like you know,

4185
01:49:12,700 --> 01:49:13,620
like you should,

4186
01:49:13,621 --> 01:49:18,621
you should achieve based on your merit
based on what you have actually shown to

4187
01:49:19,081 --> 01:49:20,580
like how much work you've put in,

4188
01:49:20,850 --> 01:49:22,290
what you've accomplished.

4189
01:49:22,350 --> 01:49:23,610
You should benefit from that.

4190
01:49:23,710 --> 01:49:26,910
The idea that everybody should be paid
equally and that everybody should just

4191
01:49:26,911 --> 01:49:27,091
have,

4192
01:49:27,091 --> 01:49:27,631
oh man,

4193
01:49:27,631 --> 01:49:29,040
we will just contribute.

4194
01:49:29,041 --> 01:49:29,540
And just,

4195
01:49:29,540 --> 01:49:29,730
uh,

4196
01:49:29,730 --> 01:49:30,301
I'll give a little,

4197
01:49:30,301 --> 01:49:33,540
you give the little dose
fucks never give their share.

4198
01:49:33,770 --> 01:49:34,050
They're,

4199
01:49:34,050 --> 01:49:35,010
they're never good.

4200
01:49:35,011 --> 01:49:36,390
They're never the best at what they do.

4201
01:49:36,540 --> 01:49:37,860
They never know how to compete.

4202
01:49:38,250 --> 01:49:39,210
They just don't.

4203
01:49:39,240 --> 01:49:39,900
They just don't.

4204
01:49:39,900 --> 01:49:40,980
It's not saying that you,

4205
01:49:41,110 --> 01:49:45,000
that there's not some aspects
of a community where we
should have some socialist

4206
01:49:45,001 --> 01:49:45,451
ideas.

4207
01:49:45,451 --> 01:49:47,280
Like I believe in free education.

4208
01:49:47,530 --> 01:49:50,350
I believe that without a doubt,

4209
01:49:50,380 --> 01:49:52,090
our nation as wealthy as it is,

4210
01:49:52,091 --> 01:49:53,830
can afford to have better healthcare,

4211
01:49:54,160 --> 01:49:54,971
better education.

4212
01:49:54,971 --> 01:49:55,210
Yeah.

4213
01:49:55,210 --> 01:49:59,290
Those two things I think are gigantic
factors in just having a healthy

4214
01:49:59,291 --> 01:50:00,124
community.

4215
01:50:00,160 --> 01:50:01,750
But if you want a quality of outcome,

4216
01:50:01,751 --> 01:50:02,860
you can suck my dick.

4217
01:50:03,220 --> 01:50:04,120
That's nonsense.

4218
01:50:04,121 --> 01:50:08,170
There's no such thing as equality of
outcome because if you have real freedom,

4219
01:50:08,350 --> 01:50:09,700
real freedom,

4220
01:50:09,820 --> 01:50:14,320
you're always going to have inequality
of outcome because the real freedom is a

4221
01:50:14,321 --> 01:50:17,470
guy like Jocko wants to get up at four
30 in the morning and work out every day,

4222
01:50:17,650 --> 01:50:19,960
whereas some people just
want to sleep til noon.

4223
01:50:20,170 --> 01:50:21,280
I'd rather just lay in bed,

4224
01:50:21,281 --> 01:50:21,581
man,

4225
01:50:21,581 --> 01:50:23,080
I like to go to the beach and hang out.

4226
01:50:23,230 --> 01:50:23,680
I'm not,

4227
01:50:23,680 --> 01:50:24,610
I'm not in a hurry.

4228
01:50:24,611 --> 01:50:25,540
I'm not in a rush.

4229
01:50:25,720 --> 01:50:26,500
Good.

4230
01:50:26,500 --> 01:50:27,760
I hope you enjoy yourself.

4231
01:50:27,850 --> 01:50:28,780
There's nothing wrong with that.

4232
01:50:28,840 --> 01:50:31,450
But if you want the same amount of monies
that motherfuckers up at four 30 in

4233
01:50:31,451 --> 01:50:32,680
the morning hustling,

4234
01:50:32,770 --> 01:50:33,850
constantly cranking out,

4235
01:50:33,910 --> 01:50:35,950
I've got three different
things in the air.

4236
01:50:35,951 --> 01:50:37,570
Three different things going on.

4237
01:50:37,571 --> 01:50:38,770
Projects constantly,

4238
01:50:38,771 --> 01:50:40,120
always in the middle of something,

4239
01:50:40,300 --> 01:50:41,133
always pushing,

4240
01:50:41,140 --> 01:50:42,160
always trying to improve.

4241
01:50:42,250 --> 01:50:43,270
Always look at himself,

4242
01:50:43,271 --> 01:50:44,560
always being self critical,

4243
01:50:44,561 --> 01:50:46,720
always analyzing what do I
have to do to get better?

4244
01:50:46,810 --> 01:50:47,643
And you're not,

4245
01:50:47,650 --> 01:50:49,720
but you want the same
outcome for [inaudible].

4246
01:50:50,400 --> 01:50:51,233
You.

4247
01:50:52,540 --> 01:50:53,260
I completely

4248
01:50:53,260 --> 01:50:54,070
agree with that.

4249
01:50:54,070 --> 01:50:55,420
I feel like there's this,

4250
01:50:55,810 --> 01:50:56,643
the world,

4251
01:50:56,690 --> 01:50:56,790
oh,

4252
01:50:56,790 --> 01:51:00,910
especially the country is in the best
place when there are more people in the

4253
01:51:00,911 --> 01:51:01,390
middle,

4254
01:51:01,390 --> 01:51:01,900
when they're,

4255
01:51:01,900 --> 01:51:02,390
when they're,

4256
01:51:02,390 --> 01:51:02,661
when,

4257
01:51:02,661 --> 01:51:04,090
when there's these extremes.

4258
01:51:04,091 --> 01:51:04,970
And I feel like the Pete,

4259
01:51:04,971 --> 01:51:06,220
that people that were in the middle,

4260
01:51:06,221 --> 01:51:09,850
they've somehow been dragged further
out to these extremes because yeah,

4261
01:51:09,970 --> 01:51:10,803
having,

4262
01:51:11,010 --> 01:51:11,843
um,

4263
01:51:12,310 --> 01:51:14,980
like going far right with some things,

4264
01:51:14,981 --> 01:51:15,310
right?

4265
01:51:15,310 --> 01:51:16,143
Um,

4266
01:51:16,390 --> 01:51:16,631
no,

4267
01:51:16,631 --> 01:51:17,590
you don't get anything.

4268
01:51:17,680 --> 01:51:19,540
You don't get this unless you work for it.

4269
01:51:19,541 --> 01:51:19,931
And you're like,

4270
01:51:19,931 --> 01:51:20,170
yeah,

4271
01:51:20,170 --> 01:51:20,591
absolutely.

4272
01:51:20,591 --> 01:51:21,311
100%.

4273
01:51:21,311 --> 01:51:21,431
And,

4274
01:51:21,431 --> 01:51:21,661
and,

4275
01:51:21,661 --> 01:51:21,881
and,

4276
01:51:21,881 --> 01:51:24,370
but like some of some of the
things that go along with that.

4277
01:51:24,760 --> 01:51:25,121
Yeah.

4278
01:51:25,121 --> 01:51:25,691
But then this,

4279
01:51:25,691 --> 01:51:27,370
everybody gets a trophy every like,

4280
01:51:27,400 --> 01:51:27,851
no,

4281
01:51:27,851 --> 01:51:28,421
everybody's in,

4282
01:51:28,421 --> 01:51:29,550
it doesn't get a trophy there.

4283
01:51:29,551 --> 01:51:30,250
There is like,

4284
01:51:30,250 --> 01:51:35,250
you should get a trophy if you are able
to compete to the level that deserve,

4285
01:51:35,471 --> 01:51:37,600
that's deserving of a
trophy and that's it.

4286
01:51:37,620 --> 01:51:37,911
Right?

4287
01:51:37,911 --> 01:51:39,340
Like everybody shouldn't get one.

4288
01:51:39,460 --> 01:51:40,570
You lost.

4289
01:51:40,660 --> 01:51:43,720
You shouldn't get the same thing
that the guy that won got right.

4290
01:51:43,721 --> 01:51:45,040
You did well and you lost and you,

4291
01:51:45,070 --> 01:51:48,250
and there's a big competition with a big
group and you did better than some of

4292
01:51:48,251 --> 01:51:48,431
them.

4293
01:51:48,431 --> 01:51:48,671
Yeah.

4294
01:51:48,671 --> 01:51:49,720
Maybe you get some of the,

4295
01:51:49,721 --> 01:51:50,554
some of the pie,

4296
01:51:50,830 --> 01:51:52,300
but like this whole thing of,

4297
01:51:52,510 --> 01:51:52,840
yeah,

4298
01:51:52,840 --> 01:51:54,010
everybody's equal.

4299
01:51:54,030 --> 01:51:54,600
I,

4300
01:51:54,600 --> 01:51:55,110
I,

4301
01:51:55,110 --> 01:51:55,931
I disagree,

4302
01:51:55,931 --> 01:51:56,764
I feel like,

4303
01:51:57,040 --> 01:51:58,030
but I feel like there's,

4304
01:51:58,031 --> 01:52:01,360
there's aspects of everything
that should be everywhere.

4305
01:52:01,361 --> 01:52:02,141
So when I say that,

4306
01:52:02,141 --> 01:52:04,840
what I mean is like capitalism,

4307
01:52:04,841 --> 01:52:05,501
like we saw,

4308
01:52:05,501 --> 01:52:08,000
we saw capitalism inside
communism in that example.

4309
01:52:08,010 --> 01:52:08,151
Yeah.

4310
01:52:08,151 --> 01:52:08,540
Right.

4311
01:52:08,540 --> 01:52:09,040
Yeah.

4312
01:52:09,040 --> 01:52:09,281
Well,

4313
01:52:09,281 --> 01:52:10,360
inside capitalism,

4314
01:52:10,361 --> 01:52:11,230
there should be some,

4315
01:52:11,231 --> 01:52:11,501
some,

4316
01:52:11,501 --> 01:52:12,400
some socialism,

4317
01:52:12,630 --> 01:52:12,940
like,

4318
01:52:12,940 --> 01:52:13,241
like,

4319
01:52:13,241 --> 01:52:13,840
um,

4320
01:52:13,840 --> 01:52:14,440
like,

4321
01:52:14,440 --> 01:52:17,260
let's look at the major league baseball,

4322
01:52:17,290 --> 01:52:17,650
right.

4323
01:52:17,650 --> 01:52:18,280
The Yankees,

4324
01:52:18,280 --> 01:52:18,570
they,

4325
01:52:18,570 --> 01:52:21,790
they're in the playoffs every year
because they can afford ever they get

4326
01:52:21,890 --> 01:52:23,260
afforded by the bass player.

4327
01:52:23,740 --> 01:52:24,020
Right.

4328
01:52:24,020 --> 01:52:24,461
But like,

4329
01:52:24,461 --> 01:52:24,790
look at,

4330
01:52:24,790 --> 01:52:25,421
look at Green Bay,

4331
01:52:25,421 --> 01:52:25,961
Wisconsin,

4332
01:52:25,961 --> 01:52:27,010
small market team,

4333
01:52:27,160 --> 01:52:28,990
they can win a Superbowl because of the,

4334
01:52:28,991 --> 01:52:33,970
of the revenue share because
of the socialistic revenue
sharing inside the NFL.

4335
01:52:34,340 --> 01:52:34,930
You know,

4336
01:52:34,930 --> 01:52:35,171
it's,

4337
01:52:35,171 --> 01:52:35,411
it's,

4338
01:52:35,411 --> 01:52:38,320
it's a weird dynamic where
there are things that,

4339
01:52:38,380 --> 01:52:41,110
that apply in different situations,

4340
01:52:41,500 --> 01:52:46,310
but like people can't compartmentalize
enough so that these things can happen

4341
01:52:46,311 --> 01:52:48,140
and we can all make it work out.

4342
01:52:48,350 --> 01:52:49,250
Like I feel like,

4343
01:52:49,400 --> 01:52:51,820
like you said about health and education.

4344
01:52:52,540 --> 01:52:52,820
Um,

4345
01:52:52,820 --> 01:52:53,001
yeah.

4346
01:52:53,001 --> 01:52:54,020
Health care and education.

4347
01:52:54,140 --> 01:52:56,420
We have the funds for those things to be,

4348
01:52:56,600 --> 01:52:58,100
to be good across the board.

4349
01:52:58,280 --> 01:53:00,770
But why is it that the schools in this,

4350
01:53:00,771 --> 01:53:04,490
in this rich area always better.

4351
01:53:04,491 --> 01:53:06,230
They always have the better scores,

4352
01:53:06,350 --> 01:53:07,670
but then when you take that same,

4353
01:53:07,671 --> 01:53:09,800
you take the same type of um,

4354
01:53:10,130 --> 01:53:12,530
effort and you put that
somewhere in a poor area,

4355
01:53:12,680 --> 01:53:13,940
their scores come up and,

4356
01:53:14,060 --> 01:53:15,140
and they can compete,

4357
01:53:15,380 --> 01:53:15,890
right?

4358
01:53:15,890 --> 01:53:20,030
If they have the same effort from the
faculty and the staff and whatnot.

4359
01:53:20,420 --> 01:53:20,840
But,

4360
01:53:20,840 --> 01:53:21,500
um,

4361
01:53:21,500 --> 01:53:23,270
and same thing with like law enforcement,

4362
01:53:23,271 --> 01:53:24,031
law enforcement is,

4363
01:53:24,031 --> 01:53:24,221
is,

4364
01:53:24,221 --> 01:53:26,480
is better in these areas where like,

4365
01:53:26,481 --> 01:53:29,180
it's like there's no crime here then this
is where all the rich people live and

4366
01:53:29,181 --> 01:53:29,540
this and that.

4367
01:53:29,540 --> 01:53:29,661
Right?

4368
01:53:29,661 --> 01:53:30,021
Yes.

4369
01:53:30,021 --> 01:53:30,960
But like if it,

4370
01:53:30,970 --> 01:53:33,020
because they also have
better law enforcement,

4371
01:53:33,070 --> 01:53:33,531
they're a kid.

4372
01:53:33,531 --> 01:53:36,170
There were police patrolling
that area in a different fashion.

4373
01:53:36,400 --> 01:53:36,920
Um,

4374
01:53:36,920 --> 01:53:37,370
like it's,

4375
01:53:37,370 --> 01:53:40,370
it's this weird thing
where it's not equal,

4376
01:53:40,430 --> 01:53:45,230
it's not equal and it doesn't
like those things should be equal.

4377
01:53:45,290 --> 01:53:45,770
But,

4378
01:53:45,770 --> 01:53:48,950
but as far as these people
live in a poor area now,

4379
01:53:48,951 --> 01:53:50,480
and these people are,

4380
01:53:50,500 --> 01:53:50,740
they,

4381
01:53:50,740 --> 01:53:51,201
they don't,

4382
01:53:51,201 --> 01:53:54,440
they have a lot of money
because of a family wealth,

4383
01:53:54,441 --> 01:53:55,700
because of work ethic.

4384
01:53:55,701 --> 01:53:56,600
Because of all of that.

4385
01:53:56,630 --> 01:53:57,200
Yeah.

4386
01:53:57,200 --> 01:53:58,100
Like every,

4387
01:53:58,101 --> 01:53:59,780
but everybody deserves to be safe.

4388
01:53:59,810 --> 01:54:02,780
Everybody deserves to have
that at the very least.

4389
01:54:03,080 --> 01:54:03,530
Right.

4390
01:54:03,530 --> 01:54:04,011
So let's,

4391
01:54:04,011 --> 01:54:08,600
let's enforce the laws and in patrol
and do those things in this area just as

4392
01:54:08,601 --> 01:54:10,040
much as we do for this area.

4393
01:54:10,280 --> 01:54:10,880
Right.

4394
01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:11,421
And put the,

4395
01:54:11,421 --> 01:54:14,480
put the money into that because
that's a community thing now.

4396
01:54:14,481 --> 01:54:16,400
And we're talking about what they have.

4397
01:54:16,401 --> 01:54:17,300
They have nicer pools.

4398
01:54:17,301 --> 01:54:17,421
Well,

4399
01:54:17,421 --> 01:54:19,130
they pay higher taxes
and they do this thing,

4400
01:54:19,160 --> 01:54:19,551
okay,

4401
01:54:19,551 --> 01:54:20,510
well if you want that,

4402
01:54:20,511 --> 01:54:21,470
you've now that you,

4403
01:54:21,471 --> 01:54:24,110
you're safe enough and your
education is where it is.

4404
01:54:24,290 --> 01:54:26,180
Let's start reinvested in that community.

4405
01:54:26,390 --> 01:54:26,760
You know,

4406
01:54:26,760 --> 01:54:27,201
let's not,

4407
01:54:27,201 --> 01:54:28,040
let's not get,

4408
01:54:28,041 --> 01:54:30,860
get to the point where
we can afford to be here.

4409
01:54:31,510 --> 01:54:32,390
So we go there.

4410
01:54:32,600 --> 01:54:32,811
No,

4411
01:54:32,811 --> 01:54:35,240
like we can afford to be there and um,

4412
01:54:35,330 --> 01:54:39,350
but let's US try reinvesting in this
community to make this community more like

4413
01:54:39,351 --> 01:54:39,891
that one.

4414
01:54:39,891 --> 01:54:42,860
But if we have the protections to do that,

4415
01:54:42,861 --> 01:54:45,950
then I feel more comfortable
reinvesting in this community.

4416
01:54:46,270 --> 01:54:46,470
It's,

4417
01:54:46,470 --> 01:54:47,600
it's a weird,

4418
01:54:47,870 --> 01:54:50,360
all these things are all over the
place and you got to put them together.

4419
01:54:50,630 --> 01:54:50,841
Well,

4420
01:54:50,841 --> 01:54:53,930
we don't treat our country
as if it's a giant community.

4421
01:54:53,960 --> 01:54:54,231
Right?

4422
01:54:54,231 --> 01:54:56,600
If it was a giant community
where everybody's equal,

4423
01:54:56,601 --> 01:54:58,670
we would look at all the
problem spots and say,

4424
01:54:58,671 --> 01:54:59,390
okay,

4425
01:54:59,390 --> 01:55:04,100
well there these crime ridden poverty
stricken communities that can't seem to

4426
01:55:04,101 --> 01:55:04,934
catch a break.

4427
01:55:04,970 --> 01:55:06,350
So the people that come out of that,

4428
01:55:06,590 --> 01:55:07,430
even though we're saying,

4429
01:55:07,431 --> 01:55:07,671
hey,

4430
01:55:07,671 --> 01:55:08,150
you have a,

4431
01:55:08,150 --> 01:55:09,620
there's an open playing field to compete.

4432
01:55:09,621 --> 01:55:10,430
That's not true.

4433
01:55:10,430 --> 01:55:10,611
Right?

4434
01:55:10,611 --> 01:55:13,940
Because they're coming at
it with a massive different
disadvantage from the jump

4435
01:55:14,080 --> 01:55:18,260
at the education disadvantage
and environmental
disadvantage in what they see

4436
01:55:18,261 --> 01:55:19,370
around them all the time.

4437
01:55:19,400 --> 01:55:20,211
They're around a lot of,

4438
01:55:20,211 --> 01:55:21,500
I can't catch a break dudes.

4439
01:55:21,501 --> 01:55:21,770
Right?

4440
01:55:21,770 --> 01:55:22,690
And a lot of trap,

4441
01:55:22,740 --> 01:55:23,780
a lot of criminals,

4442
01:55:23,781 --> 01:55:24,890
a lot of bullshit,

4443
01:55:24,920 --> 01:55:26,990
a lot of different ways
you could go wrong.

4444
01:55:26,991 --> 01:55:30,590
A lot of things that could set you down
a terrible path in life and it's around

4445
01:55:30,591 --> 01:55:31,424
you all the time.

4446
01:55:31,730 --> 01:55:35,660
And if we tried to engineer society,

4447
01:55:35,720 --> 01:55:36,830
so say well how do we,

4448
01:55:37,010 --> 01:55:40,040
how do we have less people
that are disadvantaged?

4449
01:55:40,041 --> 01:55:41,480
How do we have less losers?

4450
01:55:41,630 --> 01:55:44,070
What's the best way when you
got to to the problem spots,

4451
01:55:44,220 --> 01:55:46,440
all the problem spots we
should be dumping money in.

4452
01:55:46,710 --> 01:55:47,543
And,

4453
01:55:47,730 --> 01:55:51,240
and I'm not saying that we shouldn't do
anything overseas because I think a lot

4454
01:55:51,241 --> 01:55:55,230
of the things that we do overseas
probably help and protect us over here.

4455
01:55:55,231 --> 01:55:55,830
Yeah.

4456
01:55:55,830 --> 01:55:58,590
But there's a lot of shit we
don't have to do and that shit,

4457
01:55:58,591 --> 01:56:00,720
we could take that money
and just fix cities.

4458
01:56:00,930 --> 01:56:04,590
Just go in and throw a ton
of money and compassion.

4459
01:56:04,591 --> 01:56:09,390
And education and community centers and
make places safe for people to learn how

4460
01:56:09,391 --> 01:56:10,224
to be an adult.

4461
01:56:11,010 --> 01:56:13,380
You know what the u s military budget is?

4462
01:56:13,580 --> 01:56:14,413
You're sane.

4463
01:56:14,820 --> 01:56:15,301
It's insane.

4464
01:56:15,301 --> 01:56:16,110
You have any idea?

4465
01:56:16,110 --> 01:56:16,471
No,

4466
01:56:16,471 --> 01:56:16,980
don't.

4467
01:56:16,980 --> 01:56:18,570
It's like 600 billion.

4468
01:56:21,210 --> 01:56:22,050
I think it's higher than that.

4469
01:56:22,051 --> 01:56:22,771
It's higher than that.

4470
01:56:22,771 --> 01:56:23,604
It's in the trillions.

4471
01:56:23,830 --> 01:56:25,680
The guys in the trillion that's like that.

4472
01:56:25,890 --> 01:56:27,120
That is crazy.

4473
01:56:27,270 --> 01:56:27,541
That,

4474
01:56:27,541 --> 01:56:29,010
that I kind of takes me,

4475
01:56:30,120 --> 01:56:34,440
let's guess you say 696 I
say one point 3 trillion.

4476
01:56:34,500 --> 01:56:34,980
Wow.

4477
01:56:34,980 --> 01:56:35,791
I'm crazy though,

4478
01:56:35,791 --> 01:56:36,060
dude.

4479
01:56:36,060 --> 01:56:36,900
600 billion.

4480
01:56:36,930 --> 01:56:39,120
I don't even know what one
point 3 trillion looks like.

4481
01:56:39,760 --> 01:56:40,000
Okay.

4482
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:40,833
What is it

4483
01:56:42,340 --> 01:56:42,641
don?

4484
01:56:42,641 --> 01:56:43,474
Don.

4485
01:56:43,780 --> 01:56:44,770
Luckily both.

4486
01:56:45,490 --> 01:56:46,390
Technically both.

4487
01:56:46,480 --> 01:56:46,671
Yeah.

4488
01:56:46,671 --> 01:56:46,780
Well,

4489
01:56:46,780 --> 01:56:47,590
the thing that when you put,

4490
01:56:47,590 --> 01:56:48,423
when I googled it,

4491
01:56:48,460 --> 01:56:48,730
uh,

4492
01:56:48,730 --> 01:56:53,730
the last one that was reported I
suppose was 2015 it was 579 five nine 7

4493
01:56:54,100 --> 01:56:54,310
billion.

4494
01:56:54,310 --> 01:56:55,460
What's Year 21?

4495
01:56:55,490 --> 01:57:00,490
2015 the new one that Trump just signed
that was approved is for one point 3

4496
01:57:02,290 --> 01:57:02,530
trillion.

4497
01:57:02,530 --> 01:57:03,730
That's must be where I heard it.

4498
01:57:03,910 --> 01:57:05,410
Oh boy.

4499
01:57:05,500 --> 01:57:06,310
That's a lot of cash.

4500
01:57:06,310 --> 01:57:07,240
That's much for education,

4501
01:57:07,241 --> 01:57:08,074
Mr. Trump.

4502
01:57:08,320 --> 01:57:09,840
We don't need no stinking books.

4503
01:57:10,840 --> 01:57:11,040
Oh,

4504
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:14,480
I think that's actually the whole bill
that's 700 billion of that is for the

4505
01:57:14,481 --> 01:57:15,020
military.

4506
01:57:15,020 --> 01:57:15,201
Oh,

4507
01:57:15,201 --> 01:57:16,910
what's the rest of it for everything else?

4508
01:57:17,390 --> 01:57:18,223
Yeah.

4509
01:57:18,790 --> 01:57:22,260
I can imagine if someone just
said 700 billion for schools,

4510
01:57:22,261 --> 01:57:22,641
he'd be like,

4511
01:57:22,641 --> 01:57:23,120
what?

4512
01:57:23,120 --> 01:57:23,331
Yeah,

4513
01:57:23,331 --> 01:57:23,630
we're fine.

4514
01:57:23,630 --> 01:57:24,710
We're not fucking around anymore.

4515
01:57:24,730 --> 01:57:25,040
Yeah.

4516
01:57:25,040 --> 01:57:25,970
We're ready to take over.

4517
01:57:26,120 --> 01:57:29,930
We're going to invest 10 years with
$700 billion a year in a school system.

4518
01:57:29,960 --> 01:57:30,793
Man,

4519
01:57:30,910 --> 01:57:31,190
that's,

4520
01:57:31,190 --> 01:57:32,090
that sounds nice.

4521
01:57:32,091 --> 01:57:32,390
Right,

4522
01:57:32,390 --> 01:57:32,571
right.

4523
01:57:32,571 --> 01:57:35,690
What do you think the education
budget is for the country?

4524
01:57:35,840 --> 01:57:36,890
If you had to guess,

4525
01:57:37,070 --> 01:57:42,020
what's the overall public education
budget in the United States?

4526
01:57:42,380 --> 01:57:43,670
Primary through high school.

4527
01:57:43,700 --> 01:57:44,600
I never thought about it.

4528
01:57:44,601 --> 01:57:45,170
That's awesome.

4529
01:57:45,170 --> 01:57:45,800
Um,

4530
01:57:45,800 --> 01:57:48,440
if we go at 600 billion for the military,

4531
01:57:48,470 --> 01:57:49,550
I'm going to go with,

4532
01:57:51,220 --> 01:57:51,690
okay,

4533
01:57:51,690 --> 01:57:52,650
100 billion.

4534
01:57:53,070 --> 01:57:54,420
I'll go 100 million.

4535
01:57:54,900 --> 01:57:55,820
$100 million,

4536
01:57:55,821 --> 01:57:56,080
right.

4537
01:57:56,080 --> 01:57:56,430
Uh,

4538
01:57:56,430 --> 01:57:59,880
as of 2011 discretionary
budget was 70 billion.

4539
01:58:00,540 --> 01:58:01,020
Whoa.

4540
01:58:01,020 --> 01:58:03,270
That's up from education budget.

4541
01:58:03,290 --> 01:58:03,460
Yeah.

4542
01:58:03,460 --> 01:58:05,760
2006 it was 56 billion.

4543
01:58:07,130 --> 01:58:10,480
So it's higher than it
has been in the past.

4544
01:58:11,380 --> 01:58:12,460
70 billion.

4545
01:58:12,461 --> 01:58:13,390
And what does that cover?

4546
01:58:14,060 --> 01:58:15,050
Um,

4547
01:58:15,200 --> 01:58:17,650
there's two more fucking people that
I wouldn't say that what it covers,

4548
01:58:18,410 --> 01:58:20,690
what it's supposed to cover and what
actually covers is a different thing.

4549
01:58:20,770 --> 01:58:21,603
You know,

4550
01:58:21,800 --> 01:58:22,790
what's it supposed to cover?

4551
01:58:22,950 --> 01:58:24,920
I'm going to have to look deep into that.

4552
01:58:26,020 --> 01:58:26,270
Okay.

4553
01:58:26,270 --> 01:58:28,550
You just said there's too
many people to so many people.

4554
01:58:28,580 --> 01:58:29,413
So check this out.

4555
01:58:29,420 --> 01:58:29,620
I,

4556
01:58:29,620 --> 01:58:30,021
I've,

4557
01:58:30,021 --> 01:58:30,410
I've,

4558
01:58:30,410 --> 01:58:31,430
I think the same thing,

4559
01:58:31,480 --> 01:58:31,850
right?

4560
01:58:31,850 --> 01:58:32,300
And um,

4561
01:58:32,300 --> 01:58:34,340
I did some slight research,

4562
01:58:35,330 --> 01:58:40,330
1955 I think it was guest with
the population of the planet was,

4563
01:58:41,680 --> 01:58:41,891
oh,

4564
01:58:41,891 --> 01:58:42,010
we

4565
01:58:42,010 --> 01:58:42,731
did that the other day.

4566
01:58:42,731 --> 01:58:43,660
It was like 2 billion,

4567
01:58:43,720 --> 01:58:44,553
right?

4568
01:58:44,610 --> 01:58:44,920
Right.

4569
01:58:44,920 --> 01:58:45,370
200.

4570
01:58:45,370 --> 01:58:46,060
Two and a half.

4571
01:58:46,060 --> 01:58:46,380
Yeah,

4572
01:58:46,380 --> 01:58:47,230
two and a half billion.

4573
01:58:47,560 --> 01:58:49,750
And now we're at seven and a half billion.

4574
01:58:49,751 --> 01:58:50,440
When we went with him,

4575
01:58:50,440 --> 01:58:51,460
when I was in high school,

4576
01:58:51,490 --> 01:58:52,990
we went with like 85,

4577
01:58:52,991 --> 01:58:54,700
I think it was 5 billion.

4578
01:58:55,570 --> 01:58:59,290
So just since 1985 to today,

4579
01:58:59,590 --> 01:59:00,610
it's gone up,

4580
01:59:00,700 --> 01:59:05,700
doubled from almost from this fifties
and now we've added another half to that

4581
01:59:05,891 --> 01:59:06,970
50% of that.

4582
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:07,960
So many people.

4583
01:59:07,990 --> 01:59:08,561
But like,

4584
01:59:08,561 --> 01:59:11,740
like I was thinking about that and I'm
like looking at it and like if we're,

4585
01:59:11,741 --> 01:59:13,090
if it's exponential,

4586
01:59:13,600 --> 01:59:14,433
right?

4587
01:59:14,650 --> 01:59:18,880
In 50 years we will have nearly
20 billion people on this planet.

4588
01:59:19,010 --> 01:59:19,843
Yeah,

4589
01:59:20,350 --> 01:59:21,183
that's crazy.

4590
01:59:21,190 --> 01:59:22,000
That's crazy.

4591
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:22,241
Yeah.

4592
01:59:22,241 --> 01:59:24,460
Everybody or everywhere is
going to look like Los Angeles.

4593
01:59:24,520 --> 01:59:29,330
Like imagine if there was still like I
think in like 18 in the 18 hundreds they

4594
01:59:29,331 --> 01:59:31,690
were like still millions
of people on the planet.

4595
01:59:31,720 --> 01:59:32,081
Not,

4596
01:59:32,081 --> 01:59:32,980
not billions.

4597
01:59:33,130 --> 01:59:38,130
Herod is right near the president's
2017 budget provides 69.4 billion in

4598
01:59:38,681 --> 01:59:39,880
discretionary funding.

4599
01:59:40,060 --> 01:59:41,530
Is that but that's education.

4600
01:59:41,700 --> 01:59:42,100
Yes.

4601
01:59:42,100 --> 01:59:46,870
This is for the education bill 139.7
billion in new mandatory funding for the u

4602
01:59:46,871 --> 01:59:48,040
s department of Education.

4603
01:59:48,041 --> 01:59:51,730
The budget supports implementation
of every student succeeds act,

4604
01:59:51,731 --> 01:59:55,150
which embraces many of the reforms
in the administration along has long

4605
01:59:55,160 --> 01:59:57,910
supported to improve
outcomes for all students.

4606
01:59:57,911 --> 02:00:02,410
That also makes crucial investments
that build the administration's work to

4607
02:00:02,411 --> 02:00:07,411
advance educational equity and excellence
support teachers and school leaders

4608
02:00:08,801 --> 02:00:11,200
promote college
affordability and completion.

4609
02:00:11,320 --> 02:00:12,070
These include,

4610
02:00:12,070 --> 02:00:13,210
I think college should be free.

4611
02:00:13,900 --> 02:00:15,640
I think we could figure out
how to make college free.

4612
02:00:15,670 --> 02:00:16,870
I'm with Bernie Sanders on that.

4613
02:00:16,871 --> 02:00:17,650
It's a rare thing.

4614
02:00:17,650 --> 02:00:20,650
I just don't think you should
be in fucking debt up to
your ass hall by the time

4615
02:00:20,651 --> 02:00:21,281
you get out of school.

4616
02:00:21,281 --> 02:00:22,240
I think it's crazy.

4617
02:00:22,360 --> 02:00:24,790
It's a fucked up way to start
your life and people are like,

4618
02:00:24,791 --> 02:00:27,760
well you want to make a lump district
separates the people that really want it

4619
02:00:27,761 --> 02:00:29,560
and the people that know bull shit.

4620
02:00:29,980 --> 02:00:33,160
You get stuck in debt and you
can't even get out of that debt.

4621
02:00:33,161 --> 02:00:34,290
It's not even regular debt.

4622
02:00:34,291 --> 02:00:35,260
It's blood debt.

4623
02:00:35,360 --> 02:00:37,180
Some weird debt but doesn't,

4624
02:00:37,181 --> 02:00:39,280
doesn't have a more educated society.

4625
02:00:39,281 --> 02:00:40,540
Help everybody.

4626
02:00:40,600 --> 02:00:42,040
Everybody in the long run,

4627
02:00:42,070 --> 02:00:42,903
sure

4628
02:00:44,670 --> 02:00:45,503
we'll make more money.

4629
02:00:45,760 --> 02:00:48,200
Everybody would make more money
like I don't get that users,

4630
02:00:48,970 --> 02:00:53,950
but you would have to like make sure
that whoever the fuck is teaching these

4631
02:00:53,951 --> 02:00:54,784
kids,

4632
02:00:55,300 --> 02:00:59,470
like you'd have to be real stringent with
what you're letting get pushed through

4633
02:00:59,500 --> 02:01:01,120
if you're going to throw
that much money on it.

4634
02:01:01,270 --> 02:01:03,370
There's a lot of shit bag
and teachers out there.

4635
02:01:03,610 --> 02:01:04,960
We'd have to clean that up.

4636
02:01:05,290 --> 02:01:05,621
You know,

4637
02:01:05,621 --> 02:01:06,670
a lot of people,

4638
02:01:06,700 --> 02:01:09,340
there's a lot of shitbag teachers out
there and now they want to give him gun.

4639
02:01:10,510 --> 02:01:11,950
That's the dumbest shit of all time.

4640
02:01:12,480 --> 02:01:13,180
I'm like,

4641
02:01:13,180 --> 02:01:14,013
I was the dumbest shit.

4642
02:01:14,230 --> 02:01:15,700
That is the dumbest shit of all time.

4643
02:01:16,060 --> 02:01:18,010
You can't expect teachers
to become soldiers.

4644
02:01:18,040 --> 02:01:18,670
That's crazy.

4645
02:01:18,670 --> 02:01:19,503
That's not what they do.

4646
02:01:19,630 --> 02:01:20,020
They're not,

4647
02:01:20,020 --> 02:01:20,853
they're not warriors.

4648
02:01:21,190 --> 02:01:22,090
They shouldn't be out there.

4649
02:01:22,210 --> 02:01:24,250
Have a firefights with pilled up,

4650
02:01:24,400 --> 02:01:24,970
you know,

4651
02:01:24,970 --> 02:01:25,803
formal,

4652
02:01:25,870 --> 02:01:27,190
former high school students.

4653
02:01:27,430 --> 02:01:27,850
Yeah,

4654
02:01:27,850 --> 02:01:28,690
it's fucking insane.

4655
02:01:29,680 --> 02:01:30,940
I don't know what the solution to that is.

4656
02:01:30,941 --> 02:01:31,774
Honestly,

4657
02:01:32,230 --> 02:01:33,640
I do not know what the solution is.

4658
02:01:34,090 --> 02:01:34,301
You know,

4659
02:01:34,301 --> 02:01:36,640
the NRA thinks it's
having guns everywhere.

4660
02:01:36,850 --> 02:01:38,020
The anti second amendment.

4661
02:01:38,021 --> 02:01:39,920
People think it's getting all guns away.

4662
02:01:40,430 --> 02:01:40,820
Um,

4663
02:01:40,820 --> 02:01:42,200
but you're not going to
get all the guns away.

4664
02:01:42,380 --> 02:01:43,213
The thing about life,

4665
02:01:43,220 --> 02:01:44,480
people say guns don't kill people.

4666
02:01:44,481 --> 02:01:45,500
People kill people.

4667
02:01:45,680 --> 02:01:46,101
I'm like,

4668
02:01:46,101 --> 02:01:46,281
no.

4669
02:01:46,281 --> 02:01:47,540
People with guns kill people.

4670
02:01:47,580 --> 02:01:51,080
They definitely do hear exactly how much
the government would have to spend to

4671
02:01:51,081 --> 02:01:53,510
make public college tuition free.

4672
02:01:53,511 --> 02:01:55,070
How much do you think it is?

4673
02:01:55,160 --> 02:01:55,520
Okay,

4674
02:01:55,520 --> 02:01:56,353
let me guess.

4675
02:01:57,050 --> 02:01:58,040
1 trillion a year.

4676
02:01:58,550 --> 02:01:59,361
Wait way,

4677
02:01:59,361 --> 02:02:00,194
way less.

4678
02:02:00,290 --> 02:02:00,921
Way less.

4679
02:02:00,921 --> 02:02:01,191
Yeah.

4680
02:02:01,191 --> 02:02:03,530
I would say orange,

4681
02:02:03,540 --> 02:02:04,373
this article.

4682
02:02:04,400 --> 02:02:04,641
Okay.

4683
02:02:04,641 --> 02:02:05,970
What does it say about it?

4684
02:02:05,990 --> 02:02:06,740
But what is,

4685
02:02:06,740 --> 02:02:07,820
what is the website?

4686
02:02:08,450 --> 02:02:09,320
The Atlantic Atlantic.

4687
02:02:09,530 --> 02:02:09,801
Okay.

4688
02:02:09,801 --> 02:02:11,140
That's a left leaning website,

4689
02:02:11,190 --> 02:02:12,570
but it cannot ridiculous.

4690
02:02:12,571 --> 02:02:12,940
Yeah.

4691
02:02:12,940 --> 02:02:13,620
Dated this,

4692
02:02:13,620 --> 02:02:18,620
the article says 62 point $6 billion a
mere 62 but there's updates on the bottom

4693
02:02:20,171 --> 02:02:20,921
of the article that said,

4694
02:02:20,921 --> 02:02:24,760
that's some readers say that's an
addition to what they already spend.

4695
02:02:24,790 --> 02:02:26,260
So that makes it maybe double,

4696
02:02:26,550 --> 02:02:26,791
well,

4697
02:02:26,791 --> 02:02:27,624
you know,

4698
02:02:27,690 --> 02:02:29,880
one way they make it really fucking cheap,

4699
02:02:30,840 --> 02:02:32,820
have it available for free online.

4700
02:02:33,920 --> 02:02:36,000
Everybody should be able
to get an education online.

4701
02:02:36,060 --> 02:02:39,240
That's what I really firmly believe that
I think they should have courses that

4702
02:02:39,241 --> 02:02:42,420
you could just sign up and take
them like a regular college course.

4703
02:02:42,421 --> 02:02:44,190
You don't have to be in a
physical location anymore.

4704
02:02:44,191 --> 02:02:45,210
That's so retro.

4705
02:02:45,510 --> 02:02:47,580
That's so unnecessary.

4706
02:02:47,830 --> 02:02:50,820
Get in your car and get
the traffic and go to UCLA.

4707
02:02:50,940 --> 02:02:52,200
The only thing good about that,

4708
02:02:52,201 --> 02:02:55,230
as you're in the room with someone like
a Jordan Peterson or some really good

4709
02:02:55,231 --> 02:02:57,920
professor that's really inspirational
and you're in there with him,

4710
02:02:57,930 --> 02:02:59,280
they talked to you and you're like,

4711
02:02:59,310 --> 02:02:59,691
oh,

4712
02:02:59,691 --> 02:03:00,031
okay.

4713
02:03:00,031 --> 02:03:02,550
And you get to like be in
their presence and see like,

4714
02:03:02,580 --> 02:03:02,731
oh,

4715
02:03:02,731 --> 02:03:05,730
this guy was probably like my age one
day and he figured all this shit down and

4716
02:03:05,731 --> 02:03:05,941
like,

4717
02:03:05,941 --> 02:03:06,640
oh,

4718
02:03:06,640 --> 02:03:07,980
maybe some extra juice to that

4719
02:03:08,160 --> 02:03:09,320
to have a bookmark saved.

4720
02:03:09,380 --> 02:03:10,610
I think it was Harvard.

4721
02:03:10,640 --> 02:03:10,900
I,

4722
02:03:10,900 --> 02:03:15,830
it was a long list of us recorded
lectures that were from any class.

4723
02:03:15,831 --> 02:03:18,320
I think there's probably was a
limit to what they were doing.

4724
02:03:18,560 --> 02:03:20,270
It's definitely not accessible anymore,

4725
02:03:20,271 --> 02:03:21,530
especially for the public.

4726
02:03:21,531 --> 02:03:22,940
But it was fully accessible.

4727
02:03:23,150 --> 02:03:23,901
Anybody that wanted,

4728
02:03:23,901 --> 02:03:24,734
that's why I had it saved.

4729
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:25,280
Hmm.

4730
02:03:25,280 --> 02:03:26,110
Oh no Joe.

4731
02:03:26,110 --> 02:03:27,320
I mean when I think about that,

4732
02:03:27,321 --> 02:03:28,250
like I said earlier,

4733
02:03:28,251 --> 02:03:30,290
like all these formulas
fit into different things.

4734
02:03:30,890 --> 02:03:34,250
You say that and it's like you can be at
home while you're looking in her mind,

4735
02:03:34,251 --> 02:03:38,870
his screen and I'm learning
versus being in the same room.

4736
02:03:39,140 --> 02:03:40,010
And it's like,

4737
02:03:40,040 --> 02:03:40,640
yeah,

4738
02:03:40,640 --> 02:03:44,840
but like you could also go to a strip
club and watch strippers dance or he can

4739
02:03:44,841 --> 02:03:48,390
be at home watching them porn and
when you're at home watching him,

4740
02:03:48,400 --> 02:03:49,191
you're going to pull it out.

4741
02:03:49,191 --> 02:03:49,850
Rip One.

4742
02:03:49,850 --> 02:03:50,600
Hmm.

4743
02:03:50,600 --> 02:03:51,380
You know?

4744
02:03:51,380 --> 02:03:52,213
Right.

4745
02:03:52,280 --> 02:03:53,720
So you're saying,

4746
02:03:53,721 --> 02:03:54,171
let's say,

4747
02:03:54,171 --> 02:03:54,620
and he's like,

4748
02:03:54,620 --> 02:03:55,453
if you're at home,

4749
02:03:55,790 --> 02:03:56,623
you're just going to beat off.

4750
02:04:00,620 --> 02:04:01,170
That's,

4751
02:04:01,170 --> 02:04:02,150
that's a real problem.

4752
02:04:02,420 --> 02:04:02,821
You know?

4753
02:04:02,821 --> 02:04:03,200
Uh,

4754
02:04:03,200 --> 02:04:05,090
Louis C K was saying once that,

4755
02:04:05,210 --> 02:04:05,660
uh,

4756
02:04:05,660 --> 02:04:07,790
he has a computer that he writes on.

4757
02:04:07,791 --> 02:04:11,210
It's not connected to the Internet
because you just can't get distracted,

4758
02:04:11,390 --> 02:04:12,230
forced himself to,

4759
02:04:12,420 --> 02:04:14,180
I think that's what I'm saying.

4760
02:04:14,181 --> 02:04:16,100
The problem is the
distraction with having,

4761
02:04:16,101 --> 02:04:18,260
having access to everything right there.

4762
02:04:18,320 --> 02:04:18,850
That's true.

4763
02:04:18,850 --> 02:04:19,480
Um,

4764
02:04:19,480 --> 02:04:21,190
but when you open the
window with the teacher,

4765
02:04:21,380 --> 02:04:21,801
that's,

4766
02:04:21,801 --> 02:04:22,634
that's,

4767
02:04:22,730 --> 02:04:23,850
that's the process part.

4768
02:04:23,900 --> 02:04:24,651
It's discipline,

4769
02:04:24,651 --> 02:04:25,431
it's discipline.

4770
02:04:25,431 --> 02:04:25,901
And that,

4771
02:04:25,901 --> 02:04:27,230
that goes back to what I believe.

4772
02:04:27,231 --> 02:04:30,290
That ties back into what I was saying
before about all this entertainment out

4773
02:04:30,291 --> 02:04:30,441
there.

4774
02:04:30,441 --> 02:04:31,020
Everybody,

4775
02:04:31,020 --> 02:04:31,400
everybody's,

4776
02:04:31,400 --> 02:04:33,110
it is always like scratching at you.

4777
02:04:33,111 --> 02:04:33,321
Like,

4778
02:04:33,321 --> 02:04:33,921
hey day,

4779
02:04:33,921 --> 02:04:34,731
pay attention to me.

4780
02:04:34,731 --> 02:04:35,630
Give me something to do.

4781
02:04:36,350 --> 02:04:38,010
So this was some online

4782
02:04:38,010 --> 02:04:39,810
learning.harvard.edu.

4783
02:04:40,050 --> 02:04:43,350
So they allow you to study
the pyramids of Giza,

4784
02:04:43,410 --> 02:04:45,150
ancient Egyptian art and archeology.

4785
02:04:45,151 --> 02:04:45,790
And it's free.

4786
02:04:45,790 --> 02:04:45,890
Yeah,

4787
02:04:45,890 --> 02:04:47,000
this is a whole course on it for,

4788
02:04:47,060 --> 02:04:47,701
so that's nice.

4789
02:04:47,701 --> 02:04:48,534
It's a bunch of them.

4790
02:04:48,600 --> 02:04:50,790
How many courses do they
have that available for free?

4791
02:04:51,060 --> 02:04:51,451
Tons.

4792
02:04:51,451 --> 02:04:54,340
I don't know that that's one that
looked interesting to excellence.

4793
02:04:54,480 --> 02:04:55,410
They have a methadone.

4794
02:04:55,411 --> 02:04:56,244
Oh medicine.

4795
02:04:58,380 --> 02:04:58,801
I was like,

4796
02:04:58,801 --> 02:04:59,730
what are you giving people?

4797
02:04:59,870 --> 02:05:02,310
Get Methadone on what
courses you could take.

4798
02:05:02,370 --> 02:05:03,061
Oh that's nice.

4799
02:05:03,061 --> 02:05:03,420
No problem.

4800
02:05:03,420 --> 02:05:04,380
Then you'll get credentialed.

4801
02:05:04,410 --> 02:05:06,210
So if somebody wants you
to have a job for it,

4802
02:05:06,211 --> 02:05:08,700
you can't show them like I took
this frequency and passed it.

4803
02:05:08,701 --> 02:05:13,500
But that seems to be less and
less of a factor in in the future.

4804
02:05:13,530 --> 02:05:17,640
I think having a degree is going
to mean less than it means now.

4805
02:05:17,700 --> 02:05:19,800
I think so I feel like um,

4806
02:05:21,120 --> 02:05:21,920
with the Internet,

4807
02:05:21,920 --> 02:05:23,220
yeah you can't,

4808
02:05:23,221 --> 02:05:25,050
if you have the right guidance,

4809
02:05:25,051 --> 02:05:26,620
you got the syllabus from,

4810
02:05:26,630 --> 02:05:26,970
from a,

4811
02:05:26,970 --> 02:05:31,970
from a college course and you have the
Internet without getting the paper that

4812
02:05:32,461 --> 02:05:33,061
says you,

4813
02:05:33,061 --> 02:05:34,050
you done it.

4814
02:05:34,350 --> 02:05:38,100
You can literally learn which
you would learn in a classroom.

4815
02:05:38,600 --> 02:05:39,900
It's like a test for the job.

4816
02:05:39,901 --> 02:05:43,650
You do like say if you're a
car stereo installation person,

4817
02:05:43,770 --> 02:05:48,000
you should have a real deep knowledge of
the electrical systems in an automobile

4818
02:05:48,001 --> 02:05:51,990
and what electronics sync up with that
and how it works well and what makes them

4819
02:05:51,991 --> 02:05:52,441
work.

4820
02:05:52,441 --> 02:05:53,850
And how does a radar detector work?

4821
02:05:54,030 --> 02:05:55,500
How does this CD player work?

4822
02:05:55,501 --> 02:05:56,550
How does you,

4823
02:05:56,551 --> 02:05:59,760
should we have to take a test based on
whatever the job it is you're interested

4824
02:05:59,761 --> 02:06:00,510
in?

4825
02:06:00,510 --> 02:06:00,781
You know,

4826
02:06:00,781 --> 02:06:02,010
and if you want to be a doctor,

4827
02:06:02,011 --> 02:06:04,050
obviously we're talking
about different ball of wax,

4828
02:06:04,280 --> 02:06:04,500
you know,

4829
02:06:04,500 --> 02:06:06,630
then you should have a full
understanding of humans.

4830
02:06:06,631 --> 02:06:09,030
You're cutting people open and
drain their shins and shit.

4831
02:06:09,530 --> 02:06:10,363
He should,

4832
02:06:11,060 --> 02:06:11,760
he should,

4833
02:06:11,760 --> 02:06:15,120
he should have a real deep
understanding of the human body.

4834
02:06:15,121 --> 02:06:17,280
But like how does it do you any good?

4835
02:06:17,280 --> 02:06:20,430
If you want to be a mechanic
or if you want to be,

4836
02:06:20,431 --> 02:06:21,180
you know,

4837
02:06:21,180 --> 02:06:22,830
whatever the fuck you do for a living,

4838
02:06:22,860 --> 02:06:24,990
there should be a way where you could,

4839
02:06:25,110 --> 02:06:26,820
like if you're an advertising executive,

4840
02:06:27,150 --> 02:06:30,270
you should take a test to find out how
much you know about the advertising

4841
02:06:30,271 --> 02:06:34,530
business and there's a lot of shit that
you don't need to know that you went

4842
02:06:34,531 --> 02:06:36,120
school for their degree.

4843
02:06:36,121 --> 02:06:36,331
Yeah,

4844
02:06:36,331 --> 02:06:36,541
there's,

4845
02:06:36,541 --> 02:06:38,520
there's some weird things that
go along with that though.

4846
02:06:38,521 --> 02:06:39,040
It's like,

4847
02:06:39,040 --> 02:06:39,873
um,

4848
02:06:40,140 --> 02:06:42,250
you have all these
things that you have to,

4849
02:06:42,330 --> 02:06:44,640
to take these courses to graduate.

4850
02:06:44,920 --> 02:06:46,500
Just getting general education.

4851
02:06:46,530 --> 02:06:46,771
Yeah.

4852
02:06:46,771 --> 02:06:48,060
You have to get a general education,

4853
02:06:48,061 --> 02:06:48,721
which is a good thing,

4854
02:06:48,721 --> 02:06:48,961
right?

4855
02:06:48,961 --> 02:06:51,270
You want people to understand
what understand the world,

4856
02:06:51,400 --> 02:06:51,930
right?

4857
02:06:51,930 --> 02:06:52,201
But,

4858
02:06:52,201 --> 02:06:53,034
um,

4859
02:06:53,280 --> 02:06:55,770
there are things that are more important
and can take that back to high school.

4860
02:06:55,920 --> 02:06:58,980
And we could talk about like everybody
knows the Pythagorean theorem in high

4861
02:06:58,981 --> 02:06:59,311
school,

4862
02:06:59,311 --> 02:07:00,131
but he can't fit you.

4863
02:07:00,131 --> 02:07:01,730
You can do your taxes and you,

4864
02:07:02,300 --> 02:07:03,210
you start working,

4865
02:07:03,211 --> 02:07:04,770
most people start working at like 16.

4866
02:07:04,771 --> 02:07:08,550
When you start working at Mcdonald's
or a gap or something at 1617,

4867
02:07:08,730 --> 02:07:10,470
you're still paying taxes
at the end of the year.

4868
02:07:10,740 --> 02:07:11,041
Right.

4869
02:07:11,041 --> 02:07:12,180
So having,

4870
02:07:12,181 --> 02:07:16,320
having had doing that in
February and March in school,

4871
02:07:16,350 --> 02:07:17,370
in your math classes,

4872
02:07:17,371 --> 02:07:19,680
how is that not something that happens?

4873
02:07:20,100 --> 02:07:20,910
You know?

4874
02:07:20,910 --> 02:07:21,743
Um,

4875
02:07:22,110 --> 02:07:22,681
it's just,

4876
02:07:22,681 --> 02:07:27,681
it's one of these weird situations
where the education is important,

4877
02:07:28,860 --> 02:07:29,310
right?

4878
02:07:29,310 --> 02:07:33,600
But let's learn the things
that actually apply to life.

4879
02:07:34,170 --> 02:07:36,190
I feel like you should
get out of high school

4880
02:07:36,370 --> 02:07:38,920
with a basic understanding of most things.

4881
02:07:38,921 --> 02:07:39,280
Yes.

4882
02:07:39,280 --> 02:07:39,820
Right?

4883
02:07:39,820 --> 02:07:41,170
Like general education.

4884
02:07:41,171 --> 02:07:42,160
High school makes sense.

4885
02:07:42,180 --> 02:07:42,550
Right?

4886
02:07:42,550 --> 02:07:45,250
But I feel like once you get into college,

4887
02:07:45,490 --> 02:07:47,620
whatever the fuck you're trying to pursue,

4888
02:07:47,960 --> 02:07:49,840
well it should be very specified,

4889
02:07:50,260 --> 02:07:52,330
very specific to whatever the fuck you're,

4890
02:07:52,331 --> 02:07:52,870
you're,

4891
02:07:52,870 --> 02:07:53,530
you know,

4892
02:07:53,530 --> 02:07:54,550
your business is,

4893
02:07:54,820 --> 02:07:56,380
you don't need to take
gender studies class,

4894
02:07:56,381 --> 02:08:00,760
but also you probably don't necessarily
need all the textbook knowledge because

4895
02:08:00,910 --> 02:08:01,361
there is,

4896
02:08:01,361 --> 02:08:02,194
um,

4897
02:08:02,390 --> 02:08:02,680
you know,

4898
02:08:02,680 --> 02:08:07,680
there especially there's certain jobs
that actual experience matters more than

4899
02:08:08,201 --> 02:08:09,070
the textbook knowledge.

4900
02:08:09,071 --> 02:08:09,190
You,

4901
02:08:09,190 --> 02:08:10,023
you,

4902
02:08:10,410 --> 02:08:10,750
I don't,

4903
02:08:10,750 --> 02:08:12,700
I couldn't tell you exactly which ones.

4904
02:08:12,730 --> 02:08:12,840
Well,

4905
02:08:12,840 --> 02:08:15,730
how about with Jamie does is
a problem with Jackson job.

4906
02:08:16,040 --> 02:08:18,430
He went to school to be an audio engineer,

4907
02:08:18,431 --> 02:08:21,010
but all that shit that you use back then,

4908
02:08:21,330 --> 02:08:22,510
but that shit's all useless.

4909
02:08:22,511 --> 02:08:22,780
Yeah.

4910
02:08:22,780 --> 02:08:23,800
How much of is useless?

4911
02:08:23,860 --> 02:08:27,890
I mean the hardest test I think I took
was after we were all done was a for a

4912
02:08:27,900 --> 02:08:28,331
pro tool.

4913
02:08:28,331 --> 02:08:31,540
It's basically for a computer program
to get certified that you know,

4914
02:08:31,541 --> 02:08:32,680
this program very well.

4915
02:08:32,681 --> 02:08:33,460
Like what's almost most,

4916
02:08:33,460 --> 02:08:36,790
you were explaining that program
is like version six of the program.

4917
02:08:36,791 --> 02:08:38,470
It was back then.

4918
02:08:38,471 --> 02:08:40,570
I think they're updating it
maybe once every two years.

4919
02:08:40,900 --> 02:08:43,150
It's been updated like four
times this year probably.

4920
02:08:43,340 --> 02:08:44,860
And they're on level like 11 now.

4921
02:08:44,861 --> 02:08:47,060
So it's like completely useless
that I know all of that.

4922
02:08:47,290 --> 02:08:47,991
They've updated all,

4923
02:08:47,991 --> 02:08:50,920
all of the limits are completely
like unlimited things now.

4924
02:08:51,220 --> 02:08:52,800
So it doesn't even matter
that you know all that.

4925
02:08:52,820 --> 02:08:56,510
So someone getting out of school with
just the education that you got in school

4926
02:08:56,511 --> 02:08:57,890
literally can't do it today.

4927
02:08:58,200 --> 02:08:59,580
You'd have to go back and do it again.

4928
02:08:59,581 --> 02:08:59,940
Sort of.

4929
02:08:59,940 --> 02:09:00,990
They offer that at the school.

4930
02:09:00,991 --> 02:09:02,330
Like you can go back and um,

4931
02:09:02,950 --> 02:09:03,330
uh,

4932
02:09:03,330 --> 02:09:03,960
refresher,

4933
02:09:03,960 --> 02:09:04,171
right?

4934
02:09:04,171 --> 02:09:04,440
Yeah.

4935
02:09:04,440 --> 02:09:04,921
For free.

4936
02:09:04,921 --> 02:09:08,430
That's part of the benefit of
going to this school I would say,

4937
02:09:08,750 --> 02:09:12,390
but like to have the time and the ability
to go back to Florida and stay there

4938
02:09:12,391 --> 02:09:12,901
for a month.

4939
02:09:12,901 --> 02:09:14,130
So I could go take that class,

4940
02:09:14,140 --> 02:09:16,530
like can't take a month off
of this to do it and like,

4941
02:09:16,531 --> 02:09:19,050
who's going to pay for my
apartment down there and here?

4942
02:09:19,560 --> 02:09:20,790
It's a really tough situation.

4943
02:09:20,791 --> 02:09:21,980
You put yourself in this.

4944
02:09:22,040 --> 02:09:23,620
That's a lot with a lot of,

4945
02:09:23,621 --> 02:09:24,160
uh,

4946
02:09:24,160 --> 02:09:25,840
anything that has to do with technology,

4947
02:09:25,841 --> 02:09:26,170
right?

4948
02:09:26,170 --> 02:09:27,460
Where it's constantly moving,

4949
02:09:27,790 --> 02:09:28,630
changing and,

4950
02:09:28,700 --> 02:09:30,250
and thing about technology.

4951
02:09:30,251 --> 02:09:32,710
It's like if there's some savant in that,

4952
02:09:32,711 --> 02:09:33,041
you know,

4953
02:09:33,041 --> 02:09:33,611
Pete there,

4954
02:09:33,611 --> 02:09:37,390
these kids and these people that pick up
on technology and they understand it so

4955
02:09:37,391 --> 02:09:42,070
well and they have no formal education
with no real format education.

4956
02:09:42,071 --> 02:09:42,251
Right.

4957
02:09:42,251 --> 02:09:44,620
The technology's one of those
things that I especially,

4958
02:09:44,680 --> 02:09:48,550
I feel like it's the most apparent thing
where you don't have to go to school,

4959
02:09:49,270 --> 02:09:52,960
you have to have the experience and you
have to be engrossed in whatever the

4960
02:09:52,961 --> 02:09:53,531
subject is.

4961
02:09:53,531 --> 02:09:54,364
Exactly.

4962
02:09:54,520 --> 02:09:55,180
Yeah.

4963
02:09:55,180 --> 02:09:55,900
But then again,

4964
02:09:55,900 --> 02:09:57,820
it comes back to what we're
talking about with discipline.

4965
02:09:57,821 --> 02:10:01,720
Like how much time do you want to
spend to work on things and look that's

4966
02:10:01,721 --> 02:10:03,160
applicable to finding like you,

4967
02:10:03,161 --> 02:10:08,161
you knew so many people in the gym that
just did not put the time into drilling

4968
02:10:08,440 --> 02:10:13,030
techniques and learning them and
really getting a fully comprehensive

4969
02:10:13,031 --> 02:10:15,400
understanding of why you're supposed
to do something a certain way.

4970
02:10:15,790 --> 02:10:17,580
And they just kind of like
listened a little bit,

4971
02:10:17,590 --> 02:10:21,280
worked out kind of hard and maybe they
had a little bit of athletic talent and

4972
02:10:21,281 --> 02:10:22,390
then they would come back in.

4973
02:10:22,391 --> 02:10:27,220
But the guys who would stay and drill
and think and learn and take notes,

4974
02:10:27,400 --> 02:10:29,200
those guys always moved past.

4975
02:10:29,410 --> 02:10:29,710
Yeah.

4976
02:10:29,710 --> 02:10:30,790
They always moved further.

4977
02:10:30,940 --> 02:10:34,040
And it also the guys that we're willing

4978
02:10:34,040 --> 02:10:36,210
to do what was uncomfortable going to do,

4979
02:10:36,211 --> 02:10:37,580
the things that they're not good at.

4980
02:10:37,880 --> 02:10:38,210
Like,

4981
02:10:38,210 --> 02:10:39,043
um,

4982
02:10:39,530 --> 02:10:40,363
I didn't,

4983
02:10:40,370 --> 02:10:41,120
I didn't like it.

4984
02:10:41,120 --> 02:10:41,390
I,

4985
02:10:41,390 --> 02:10:41,901
like I said,

4986
02:10:41,901 --> 02:10:42,591
I don't like getting hit.

4987
02:10:42,591 --> 02:10:43,610
I didn't like getting hit.

4988
02:10:43,670 --> 02:10:44,060
I mean,

4989
02:10:44,060 --> 02:10:45,620
I accept that as a part of the job,

4990
02:10:45,860 --> 02:10:48,800
but I didn't like it when
I first started training.

4991
02:10:48,860 --> 02:10:51,140
I probably feel like my first 10,

4992
02:10:51,141 --> 02:10:51,980
15 fights,

4993
02:10:52,370 --> 02:10:56,720
I was like showing up late to
practice because boxing was first.

4994
02:10:57,230 --> 02:10:58,220
I didn't want a spa.

4995
02:10:58,460 --> 02:11:00,760
I didn't want to get hit like I,

4996
02:11:01,190 --> 02:11:02,720
and so I was like,

4997
02:11:02,721 --> 02:11:02,931
well,

4998
02:11:02,931 --> 02:11:03,860
I don't like getting hit.

4999
02:11:03,890 --> 02:11:04,970
I got to avoid getting hit,

5000
02:11:05,030 --> 02:11:05,930
but I gotta be,

5001
02:11:06,020 --> 02:11:09,170
I gotta have studying things coming in
and meet us to learn how to avoid that.

5002
02:11:09,480 --> 02:11:10,160
Wow.

5003
02:11:10,160 --> 02:11:11,630
So I would,

5004
02:11:11,631 --> 02:11:12,050
I would,

5005
02:11:12,050 --> 02:11:13,160
I started showing up on time.

5006
02:11:13,161 --> 02:11:15,470
I started doing more boxing and
they started doing more boxing.

5007
02:11:15,470 --> 02:11:16,280
I was like,

5008
02:11:16,280 --> 02:11:16,371
Oh,

5009
02:11:16,371 --> 02:11:17,204
this is fun.

5010
02:11:17,450 --> 02:11:17,781
This is,

5011
02:11:17,781 --> 02:11:18,500
I like this.

5012
02:11:18,500 --> 02:11:19,400
I'm enjoying this.

5013
02:11:19,520 --> 02:11:20,540
Same thing with wrestling.

5014
02:11:20,660 --> 02:11:21,740
I know how to sprawl.

5015
02:11:22,400 --> 02:11:23,870
I knew how to shoot a double,

5016
02:11:23,960 --> 02:11:25,010
a basic double,

5017
02:11:25,040 --> 02:11:25,401
you know,

5018
02:11:25,401 --> 02:11:25,581
the,

5019
02:11:25,581 --> 02:11:26,780
the 1990s double.

5020
02:11:27,110 --> 02:11:27,351
But,

5021
02:11:27,351 --> 02:11:28,070
um,

5022
02:11:28,070 --> 02:11:29,390
then I started training with Tyron,

5023
02:11:29,460 --> 02:11:33,170
then I started treating with Steve Brown
and Dan [inaudible] and Jordan lean and

5024
02:11:33,320 --> 02:11:33,680
you know,

5025
02:11:33,680 --> 02:11:33,940
these,

5026
02:11:33,940 --> 02:11:37,790
these dd one wrestlers and starting to
learn all the other aspects of wrestling.

5027
02:11:38,090 --> 02:11:39,950
There was something I did
in the fight with stout.

5028
02:11:39,951 --> 02:11:41,460
Where is that ankle breaker?

5029
02:11:41,580 --> 02:11:42,413
I tried to,

5030
02:11:42,440 --> 02:11:42,861
it's not,

5031
02:11:42,861 --> 02:11:44,240
it doesn't actually breaking my ankle.

5032
02:11:44,241 --> 02:11:47,990
It's just the name of the technique where
you actually watched the tape and you,

5033
02:11:48,050 --> 02:11:49,220
you call it like a standing,

5034
02:11:49,221 --> 02:11:51,680
he'll hook right where I have his ankle,

5035
02:11:51,860 --> 02:11:52,693
single leg.

5036
02:11:52,730 --> 02:11:54,710
And I tried to trip him
and crank his leg down.

5037
02:11:54,740 --> 02:11:55,310
Yeah.

5038
02:11:55,310 --> 02:11:57,020
And I'm like,

5039
02:11:57,021 --> 02:12:01,580
I would've never done that if I hadn't
been wrestling with these kids and

5040
02:12:01,581 --> 02:12:02,540
learning these things.

5041
02:12:02,541 --> 02:12:03,320
And there's so much,

5042
02:12:03,320 --> 02:12:06,110
so much about it and it just
became a whole lot of fun now.

5043
02:12:06,290 --> 02:12:07,610
Like I used to hate wrestling.

5044
02:12:07,611 --> 02:12:09,620
I used to not want to do it at all now.

5045
02:12:09,621 --> 02:12:12,630
Like it's all kind of like all
I want to do you see that with

5046
02:12:12,850 --> 02:12:13,420
everything.

5047
02:12:13,420 --> 02:12:15,640
You see that with Jujitsu
guys getting into striking,

5048
02:12:15,720 --> 02:12:19,500
she would is getting into the ground
game wrestlers getting in the striking.

5049
02:12:19,550 --> 02:12:20,080
Yeah.

5050
02:12:20,080 --> 02:12:21,160
They just don't want to do it.

5051
02:12:21,190 --> 02:12:24,340
They just don't and they also
particularly don't want to get involved in

5052
02:12:24,341 --> 02:12:25,930
something they're not really good at.

5053
02:12:25,960 --> 02:12:28,150
Like if you're a monster at one thing,

5054
02:12:28,151 --> 02:12:29,500
like if you're a monster on the ground,

5055
02:12:29,860 --> 02:12:31,000
you don't want to be a white belt,

5056
02:12:31,001 --> 02:12:32,200
a kid kickboxing.

5057
02:12:32,201 --> 02:12:32,411
Yeah.

5058
02:12:32,411 --> 02:12:36,470
Your legs chewed up and get your nose
bloodied every time you spar and you,

5059
02:12:36,700 --> 02:12:38,080
you're covering up in
the corner and be like,

5060
02:12:38,081 --> 02:12:41,080
I can just grab this guy and
making my bitch and you can't even,

5061
02:12:41,230 --> 02:12:42,670
you got to just eat shots.

5062
02:12:42,730 --> 02:12:43,400
You know,

5063
02:12:43,400 --> 02:12:44,320
nobody wants that.

5064
02:12:44,620 --> 02:12:49,620
He saw that a lot with
kickboxers in particular that
would go into Jujitsu class

5065
02:12:50,170 --> 02:12:53,140
and just did not like how
they would get humbled.

5066
02:12:53,170 --> 02:12:53,620
Yup.

5067
02:12:53,620 --> 02:12:56,530
They did not like it at all because they
were literally starting from scratch.

5068
02:12:56,531 --> 02:12:59,830
If you don't have a grappling background
and you go in there and get some black

5069
02:12:59,831 --> 02:13:00,700
belts and killers,

5070
02:13:01,060 --> 02:13:02,350
they make you feel helpless.

5071
02:13:02,370 --> 02:13:02,650
Yeah.

5072
02:13:02,650 --> 02:13:03,700
They make you feel like you,

5073
02:13:03,701 --> 02:13:04,111
you,

5074
02:13:04,111 --> 02:13:06,160
you are not safe ever.

5075
02:13:06,250 --> 02:13:08,110
All they have to do is
grab you and it's over.

5076
02:13:08,350 --> 02:13:10,180
You're 100% getting choked.

5077
02:13:10,720 --> 02:13:12,610
That's too fucked up for some people.

5078
02:13:12,611 --> 02:13:13,810
They can't handle that shit.

5079
02:13:14,380 --> 02:13:15,213
They feel like,

5080
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:19,840
and then that's the case also with like
a slow plodding grappler that fights

5081
02:13:19,841 --> 02:13:22,930
like a dynamic striker and then
you have to stand up like whoa.

5082
02:13:23,170 --> 02:13:27,130
And you get leg kicked it down
by Edson Barboza fuck all that.

5083
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,010
Fuck that.

5084
02:13:30,790 --> 02:13:32,040
I've been leg kicked

5085
02:13:32,040 --> 02:13:32,873
to death,

5086
02:13:34,560 --> 02:13:39,030
but I've taken two or three from Tiago
in a practice when I first started

5087
02:13:39,031 --> 02:13:41,040
training in American
top team and I was like,

5088
02:13:41,090 --> 02:13:41,380
I,

5089
02:13:41,380 --> 02:13:43,530
I feel good about checking kicks in.

5090
02:13:43,610 --> 02:13:44,550
I'm comfortable there.

5091
02:13:44,551 --> 02:13:45,540
But he landed a couple,

5092
02:13:45,541 --> 02:13:45,811
I was like,

5093
02:13:45,811 --> 02:13:45,931
yeah,

5094
02:13:45,931 --> 02:13:46,531
fuck that.

5095
02:13:46,531 --> 02:13:47,400
I'm like,

5096
02:13:47,610 --> 02:13:51,840
so I would work with Tiago a lot and
I feel comfortable now checking kicks.

5097
02:13:51,841 --> 02:13:54,090
You might get one might get two off,

5098
02:13:54,150 --> 02:13:54,660
but um,

5099
02:13:54,660 --> 02:13:55,500
I'm not going to let,

5100
02:13:56,230 --> 02:13:58,020
I'm get letting you do that to me.

5101
02:13:58,021 --> 02:13:59,940
I don't want good whipping.

5102
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:00,351
Right.

5103
02:14:00,351 --> 02:14:00,640
Lung.

5104
02:14:00,640 --> 02:14:01,110
Yeah.

5105
02:14:01,110 --> 02:14:02,400
He would whip it in there.

5106
02:14:02,460 --> 02:14:03,293
You know,

5107
02:14:03,300 --> 02:14:04,110
like his,

5108
02:14:04,110 --> 02:14:07,230
his kick was like super
textbook man when he,

5109
02:14:07,231 --> 02:14:08,670
especially when he was in his prime,

5110
02:14:09,150 --> 02:14:11,010
he would throw that jab one.

5111
02:14:11,130 --> 02:14:12,390
He was either just throw a one,

5112
02:14:12,391 --> 02:14:16,370
two or a jab and then just
slammed that right leg in there.

5113
02:14:16,940 --> 02:14:18,090
He's hopping into it.

5114
02:14:18,120 --> 02:14:18,990
Whoa.

5115
02:14:19,020 --> 02:14:22,770
Like that's how I feel like as in my
boss is like the 2.0 with Tiago ovens,

5116
02:14:22,771 --> 02:14:23,460
you know,

5117
02:14:23,460 --> 02:14:24,480
he's a little faster.

5118
02:14:24,600 --> 02:14:24,960
Yeah.

5119
02:14:24,960 --> 02:14:25,950
It's in stunning.

5120
02:14:26,460 --> 02:14:30,330
Like especially that switch kick he
throws that switch kick and you're like,

5121
02:14:30,331 --> 02:14:31,164
what?

5122
02:14:31,590 --> 02:14:32,400
Yeah,

5123
02:14:32,400 --> 02:14:36,180
his left leg switch Gig is probably
the fastest kick I've ever seen anybody

5124
02:14:36,181 --> 02:14:37,800
throw from that stance.

5125
02:14:37,980 --> 02:14:39,960
I love to see like something
lined up where you,

5126
02:14:39,961 --> 02:14:42,480
you time like in a regular person,

5127
02:14:42,560 --> 02:14:43,393
a south paws,

5128
02:14:43,800 --> 02:14:44,200
right.

5129
02:14:44,200 --> 02:14:45,030
Kick,

5130
02:14:45,030 --> 02:14:46,490
left kick and you,

5131
02:14:46,491 --> 02:14:48,900
you time his switch kick to that.

5132
02:14:49,260 --> 02:14:51,990
We'll also put his up against
somebody else's switch kick.

5133
02:14:52,260 --> 02:14:55,600
He's got like a [inaudible] world
championship caliber switched care.

5134
02:14:55,630 --> 02:14:55,950
Yeah.

5135
02:14:55,950 --> 02:14:58,230
Like you see like a real
high level Thai boxer.

5136
02:14:58,231 --> 02:14:59,820
They've got that same kind of speed to it.

5137
02:15:00,160 --> 02:15:01,110
You watch it and you're like,

5138
02:15:01,170 --> 02:15:03,600
there's no comparison in the octagon.

5139
02:15:03,630 --> 02:15:04,690
You're not countering that.

5140
02:15:04,710 --> 02:15:04,980
You,

5141
02:15:04,980 --> 02:15:07,060
you'd be lucky to react to react in time.

5142
02:15:07,400 --> 02:15:08,280
You just taking it,

5143
02:15:08,460 --> 02:15:11,100
just taking it real quick.

5144
02:15:11,460 --> 02:15:12,360
But again,

5145
02:15:12,361 --> 02:15:14,850
we go back to that normal Grumet
I'll fight as good as he was.

5146
02:15:14,880 --> 02:15:15,930
He got fucking mauled.

5147
02:15:15,980 --> 02:15:16,470
Yeah.

5148
02:15:16,470 --> 02:15:16,840
That's,

5149
02:15:16,840 --> 02:15:20,490
that's what's really crazy because he
didn't get mauled in the Ferguson fight.

5150
02:15:20,700 --> 02:15:21,750
It was a good fight.

5151
02:15:22,050 --> 02:15:22,741
It was a good fight.

5152
02:15:22,741 --> 02:15:23,640
Ferguson was winning.

5153
02:15:23,910 --> 02:15:27,250
It was a good fight until Tony caught
him with the doors and sunk that choke

5154
02:15:27,251 --> 02:15:27,960
him.

5155
02:15:27,960 --> 02:15:28,441
But then again,

5156
02:15:28,441 --> 02:15:29,640
that's a few years too.

5157
02:15:30,320 --> 02:15:30,630
Yeah,

5158
02:15:30,630 --> 02:15:30,991
definitely.

5159
02:15:30,991 --> 02:15:31,830
It saves them Barboza.

5160
02:15:31,831 --> 02:15:32,101
It might be,

5161
02:15:32,101 --> 02:15:32,934
they better,

5162
02:15:33,900 --> 02:15:34,770
everybody should be bad.

5163
02:15:34,771 --> 02:15:36,660
All three of those guys should be
getting it better at this point.

5164
02:15:36,661 --> 02:15:37,300
Yeah.

5165
02:15:37,300 --> 02:15:38,133
Uh,

5166
02:15:38,220 --> 02:15:39,053
um,

5167
02:15:39,450 --> 02:15:39,841
but yeah,

5168
02:15:39,841 --> 02:15:40,051
it's,

5169
02:15:40,051 --> 02:15:40,884
it's,

5170
02:15:41,340 --> 02:15:42,091
it's dangerous.

5171
02:15:42,091 --> 02:15:42,181
And,

5172
02:15:42,181 --> 02:15:42,401
and I,

5173
02:15:42,401 --> 02:15:43,440
I would like to see,

5174
02:15:44,010 --> 02:15:44,350
I mean,

5175
02:15:44,350 --> 02:15:44,930
Barbosa,

5176
02:15:44,930 --> 02:15:46,740
he's shown improvement after that.

5177
02:15:46,741 --> 02:15:48,240
After every loss that he had,

5178
02:15:48,241 --> 02:15:50,040
he showed improvement after the Tony loss,

5179
02:15:50,041 --> 02:15:50,580
you know,

5180
02:15:50,580 --> 02:15:52,320
so this fight with Kevin Lee,

5181
02:15:52,830 --> 02:15:53,640
let's see,

5182
02:15:53,640 --> 02:15:55,860
that's right into the
fucking hot of things too.

5183
02:15:56,370 --> 02:15:58,700
Like right out of the
frying pan into the fire.

5184
02:15:58,701 --> 02:16:00,210
Like for both guys though.

5185
02:16:00,420 --> 02:16:00,970
Fuck yeah.

5186
02:16:00,970 --> 02:16:01,711
For those guys.

5187
02:16:01,711 --> 02:16:02,001
Yeah.

5188
02:16:02,001 --> 02:16:02,834
It's Kinda crazy.

5189
02:16:03,660 --> 02:16:04,320
Kinda crazy.

5190
02:16:04,320 --> 02:16:05,850
Kevin Lee might get beat up in that one.

5191
02:16:05,910 --> 02:16:06,421
Oh yeah,

5192
02:16:06,421 --> 02:16:08,000
man might get wheeled care act.

5193
02:16:08,060 --> 02:16:08,450
Yeah.

5194
02:16:08,450 --> 02:16:08,760
You know,

5195
02:16:08,760 --> 02:16:10,620
he might get Terry Adams
remember that fine.

5196
02:16:10,660 --> 02:16:11,060
Yup.

5197
02:16:11,060 --> 02:16:11,710
And the crazy,

5198
02:16:11,710 --> 02:16:14,610
that was the first time a wheel
kick ever landed in a UFC fight.

5199
02:16:14,940 --> 02:16:15,860
First Wheel Cafe,

5200
02:16:15,861 --> 02:16:16,650
right?

5201
02:16:16,650 --> 02:16:17,190
Yeah.

5202
02:16:17,190 --> 02:16:20,010
I think Seth Petra Zellie
landed a wheel kick,

5203
02:16:20,280 --> 02:16:21,900
but he didn't knock anybody out with it.

5204
02:16:22,080 --> 02:16:23,820
You need someone with
that kind of speed though.

5205
02:16:24,440 --> 02:16:25,273
Ooh.

5206
02:16:25,580 --> 02:16:27,120
Because the game has changed,

5207
02:16:27,150 --> 02:16:27,811
but then you know,

5208
02:16:27,811 --> 02:16:29,190
Vituro landed on rock.

5209
02:16:29,320 --> 02:16:31,060
A bunch of people have
landed wheel kick since then.

5210
02:16:31,100 --> 02:16:31,360
Yeah.

5211
02:16:31,360 --> 02:16:34,240
But that one wheel kick was so crazy.

5212
02:16:34,660 --> 02:16:35,920
It was so perfect.

5213
02:16:35,930 --> 02:16:40,120
Atlanta ride on the jaw and just shut
the lights out and he went down like a

5214
02:16:40,121 --> 02:16:40,780
tree.

5215
02:16:40,780 --> 02:16:41,081
Yeah,

5216
02:16:41,081 --> 02:16:42,460
he was out going down.

5217
02:16:42,480 --> 02:16:42,790
Yeah.

5218
02:16:42,790 --> 02:16:43,750
That was in Brazil.

5219
02:16:45,250 --> 02:16:45,560
I Dunno,

5220
02:16:45,560 --> 02:16:47,320
but both is a fun guy to watch.

5221
02:16:47,321 --> 02:16:47,591
Man.

5222
02:16:47,591 --> 02:16:47,950
I'm,

5223
02:16:47,950 --> 02:16:50,290
I'm excited to be on
the desk for that one.

5224
02:16:50,440 --> 02:16:51,260
Yeah,

5225
02:16:51,260 --> 02:16:51,851
it's a good fight.

5226
02:16:51,851 --> 02:16:53,080
Especially those two fights.

5227
02:16:53,140 --> 02:16:53,710
Um,

5228
02:16:53,710 --> 02:16:54,280
like I,

5229
02:16:54,280 --> 02:16:56,140
I love watching cub and Frankie fight.

5230
02:16:56,170 --> 02:16:57,850
Like I still feel the same way about,

5231
02:16:58,300 --> 02:16:59,133
about,

5232
02:16:59,260 --> 02:17:01,150
I think I would love to see that later.

5233
02:17:01,340 --> 02:17:02,800
I'm not necessarily giving love to see,

5234
02:17:03,220 --> 02:17:08,140
I'm not crazy about the fight in the
sense that I've seen it once and it could

5235
02:17:08,141 --> 02:17:09,160
go that way again.

5236
02:17:09,370 --> 02:17:12,270
But I am excited to see
the improvements that if,

5237
02:17:12,280 --> 02:17:15,280
if cub is be able to make any
adjustments and going into that one.

5238
02:17:15,700 --> 02:17:16,480
Um,

5239
02:17:16,480 --> 02:17:19,450
but it's not a necessary thing.

5240
02:17:19,451 --> 02:17:20,650
There some fights that I don't,

5241
02:17:20,710 --> 02:17:23,470
I don't like them just for
the mathematics of the fight.

5242
02:17:23,471 --> 02:17:24,041
Like God,

5243
02:17:24,041 --> 02:17:26,110
Dustin [inaudible] I love Dustin.

5244
02:17:26,110 --> 02:17:26,943
He's my boy.

5245
02:17:27,280 --> 02:17:27,670
Right.

5246
02:17:27,670 --> 02:17:31,870
But I don't like it
because Dustin and addy,

5247
02:17:31,871 --> 02:17:32,990
the fight with Dustin and Eddie,

5248
02:17:33,110 --> 02:17:34,270
the fight was going one way.

5249
02:17:34,271 --> 02:17:35,104
There was a,

5250
02:17:36,510 --> 02:17:38,800
was it called a no contest
for disqualification.

5251
02:17:39,060 --> 02:17:39,940
I'm like that.

5252
02:17:40,840 --> 02:17:41,860
I disagree with that.

5253
02:17:41,890 --> 02:17:42,970
I know I'm biased,

5254
02:17:42,971 --> 02:17:47,770
but I feel like my argument is strong
in that the ref herb came back to the

5255
02:17:47,771 --> 02:17:51,880
locker rooms and he explained to
us that we're using the old rules.

5256
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:53,920
So if by the old rules,

5257
02:17:53,950 --> 02:17:55,990
all three of those needs were illegal.

5258
02:17:56,350 --> 02:17:56,591
Right.

5259
02:17:56,591 --> 02:17:58,300
It doesn't matter if it was intentional.

5260
02:17:58,301 --> 02:17:59,380
It matters if it's illegal.

5261
02:17:59,410 --> 02:17:59,711
That's,

5262
02:17:59,711 --> 02:18:00,770
that's the way I understand it.

5263
02:18:00,771 --> 02:18:00,970
Right.

5264
02:18:00,970 --> 02:18:01,461
So that,

5265
02:18:01,461 --> 02:18:02,141
so that's my thing.

5266
02:18:02,141 --> 02:18:04,600
I feel it should be
disqualified and she'd be lost.

5267
02:18:04,620 --> 02:18:05,100
Right.

5268
02:18:05,100 --> 02:18:05,690
Yeah.

5269
02:18:05,690 --> 02:18:06,250
Um,

5270
02:18:06,250 --> 02:18:06,611
coming.

5271
02:18:06,611 --> 02:18:08,980
I think that's a real good argument.

5272
02:18:09,400 --> 02:18:10,510
So real good argument.

5273
02:18:10,840 --> 02:18:13,240
And I don't think Getty's a dirty fighter.

5274
02:18:13,270 --> 02:18:13,630
No,

5275
02:18:13,630 --> 02:18:16,990
but I do think Dustin was winning
that fight up until those moments.

5276
02:18:17,200 --> 02:18:17,560
Yeah,

5277
02:18:17,560 --> 02:18:18,101
I agree.

5278
02:18:18,101 --> 02:18:21,910
He had heard Eddie and it stunned him
on several occasions to Eddie came back

5279
02:18:21,911 --> 02:18:22,744
and cracked him.

5280
02:18:22,960 --> 02:18:24,430
There was a lot going on in that fight.

5281
02:18:24,431 --> 02:18:25,180
But those,

5282
02:18:25,180 --> 02:18:28,990
those needs where they're supposed to
be a disqualification for something like

5283
02:18:28,991 --> 02:18:29,081
that.

5284
02:18:29,081 --> 02:18:29,231
Right.

5285
02:18:29,231 --> 02:18:31,510
And that's what the whole idea
is about doing something illegal.

5286
02:18:31,540 --> 02:18:33,670
You do something illegal and the
guy gets really hurt from it.

5287
02:18:33,730 --> 02:18:34,540
Yeah.

5288
02:18:34,540 --> 02:18:35,410
That's illegal.

5289
02:18:35,411 --> 02:18:36,490
You weren't supposed to do it.

5290
02:18:36,520 --> 02:18:37,690
It's a disqualification.

5291
02:18:37,750 --> 02:18:39,100
I think using the heat of the moment,

5292
02:18:39,101 --> 02:18:40,990
you probably didn't even know
whether it was legal or not really.

5293
02:18:40,991 --> 02:18:42,130
It was just trying to land knees.

5294
02:18:42,280 --> 02:18:42,581
Yeah.

5295
02:18:42,581 --> 02:18:47,581
Who knows he's been rocked when you've
got to put that into account as well.

5296
02:18:48,160 --> 02:18:49,810
He got hurt real bad in that fight.

5297
02:18:49,811 --> 02:18:50,800
Dustin cracked him.

5298
02:18:50,980 --> 02:18:51,813
Yeah.

5299
02:18:51,940 --> 02:18:52,240
Yeah.

5300
02:18:52,240 --> 02:18:54,730
Like a mathematically,

5301
02:18:54,731 --> 02:18:55,900
would you like to see the rematch?

5302
02:18:55,960 --> 02:18:57,460
I would like to see the rematch.

5303
02:18:57,760 --> 02:18:58,360
Um,

5304
02:18:58,360 --> 02:18:58,931
definitely.

5305
02:18:58,931 --> 02:18:59,711
I mean Dustin was,

5306
02:18:59,711 --> 02:19:02,800
was lobbying for the rematch
also and then on top of that,

5307
02:19:02,980 --> 02:19:07,660
mathematically I feel like it doesn't
make sense because Eddie just beat bkg.

5308
02:19:08,140 --> 02:19:08,650
Right.

5309
02:19:08,650 --> 02:19:10,810
So like it's like it's a good point.

5310
02:19:10,840 --> 02:19:15,070
This disqualification happened and
this one guy got to step up the ladder.

5311
02:19:15,460 --> 02:19:16,600
But you've now,

5312
02:19:16,630 --> 02:19:17,710
if you want to step up the ladder,

5313
02:19:17,711 --> 02:19:19,000
you have to do exactly what he did.

5314
02:19:19,120 --> 02:19:19,480
Right.

5315
02:19:19,480 --> 02:19:20,230
Those are good point.

5316
02:19:20,230 --> 02:19:20,860
Yeah.

5317
02:19:20,860 --> 02:19:21,431
That's a good point.

5318
02:19:21,431 --> 02:19:25,510
Well that essentially is solidifying
the position as a no contest.

5319
02:19:25,511 --> 02:19:26,070
Right.

5320
02:19:26,070 --> 02:19:26,840
Cause you're making,

5321
02:19:26,840 --> 02:19:28,160
you think he should have won.

5322
02:19:28,670 --> 02:19:33,440
I tend to agree with you and you think
that he should have a better position.

5323
02:19:34,580 --> 02:19:34,821
Yeah.

5324
02:19:34,821 --> 02:19:36,440
I think a rematch would be the way to go,

5325
02:19:36,500 --> 02:19:37,730
but I still want to see that fight.

5326
02:19:37,820 --> 02:19:38,440
I'll be honest with you.

5327
02:19:38,440 --> 02:19:38,940
I like,

5328
02:19:38,940 --> 02:19:40,730
I lie as a fight fan.

5329
02:19:40,760 --> 02:19:41,230
Yeah.

5330
02:19:41,230 --> 02:19:41,521
Gates,

5331
02:19:41,521 --> 02:19:42,354
he boy a

5332
02:19:43,900 --> 02:19:44,211
cage.

5333
02:19:44,211 --> 02:19:45,080
He's an interesting guy.

5334
02:19:45,350 --> 02:19:45,740
Yeah.

5335
02:19:45,740 --> 02:19:46,550
Tough motherfucker.

5336
02:19:46,550 --> 02:19:49,280
And he throws leg kicks from
like a foot away from you.

5337
02:19:49,670 --> 02:19:51,170
He's like right on top of you.

5338
02:19:51,171 --> 02:19:51,511
And he,

5339
02:19:51,511 --> 02:19:54,110
he swivels his hips and
chops down with that leg.

5340
02:19:54,950 --> 02:19:57,290
He doesn't care about getting
ran over with a takedown either.

5341
02:19:58,360 --> 02:19:58,700
Well,

5342
02:19:58,700 --> 02:19:59,690
he's a very good wrestler.

5343
02:19:59,750 --> 02:20:00,583
Yeah.

5344
02:20:00,680 --> 02:20:01,131
Very good.

5345
02:20:01,131 --> 02:20:03,020
Rest of the chooses to stand and bang,

5346
02:20:03,530 --> 02:20:03,801
you know,

5347
02:20:03,801 --> 02:20:05,680
and just breaks guys with his will done.

5348
02:20:05,690 --> 02:20:06,560
Michael Johnson fight.

5349
02:20:06,561 --> 02:20:07,820
Holy Shit.

5350
02:20:08,270 --> 02:20:09,590
Holy Shit.

5351
02:20:09,980 --> 02:20:11,810
And when you stop and think about
that right after I said that,

5352
02:20:11,811 --> 02:20:12,021
I'm like,

5353
02:20:12,021 --> 02:20:12,531
God damn.

5354
02:20:12,531 --> 02:20:14,600
Michael Johnson's been
in some fucking wars.

5355
02:20:14,601 --> 02:20:15,434
Yes.

5356
02:20:15,590 --> 02:20:17,090
He's been in some wars

5357
02:20:17,850 --> 02:20:18,683
with um,

5358
02:20:19,200 --> 02:20:20,100
with Ferguson.

5359
02:20:20,130 --> 02:20:20,361
I mean,

5360
02:20:20,361 --> 02:20:20,581
well,

5361
02:20:20,581 --> 02:20:21,780
he beat up Tony a bit.

5362
02:20:22,170 --> 02:20:22,830
Um,

5363
02:20:22,830 --> 02:20:24,540
but Johnson Johnson is one of those guys.

5364
02:20:24,541 --> 02:20:25,351
You can't count out.

5365
02:20:25,351 --> 02:20:26,011
Either don't,

5366
02:20:26,011 --> 02:20:26,610
but he,

5367
02:20:26,610 --> 02:20:27,443
he,

5368
02:20:27,780 --> 02:20:29,730
his inconsistencies with throws me off.

5369
02:20:29,830 --> 02:20:30,580
Yeah.

5370
02:20:30,580 --> 02:20:31,390
You know,

5371
02:20:31,390 --> 02:20:33,460
it's oftentimes very
good luck in the port.

5372
02:20:33,461 --> 02:20:35,330
A fight when he knocked out Dustin's,

5373
02:20:35,350 --> 02:20:36,020
he's very good,

5374
02:20:36,020 --> 02:20:37,930
not fight and you know,

5375
02:20:37,931 --> 02:20:40,330
and then he's had his moments,

5376
02:20:40,360 --> 02:20:41,860
but then Elkins just take some towns,

5377
02:20:41,861 --> 02:20:42,430
strangles him.

5378
02:20:42,430 --> 02:20:42,701
It's like,

5379
02:20:42,701 --> 02:20:43,534
wow,

5380
02:20:44,030 --> 02:20:45,950
I wonder if that cut had
anything to do with it,

5381
02:20:45,951 --> 02:20:46,784
you know?

5382
02:20:47,320 --> 02:20:48,310
Did he get cut in that fight?

5383
02:20:48,520 --> 02:20:49,031
The weight cut?

5384
02:20:49,031 --> 02:20:49,330
I'm sorry.

5385
02:20:49,330 --> 02:20:49,661
Oh,

5386
02:20:49,661 --> 02:20:49,991
the weight.

5387
02:20:49,991 --> 02:20:53,050
Just making 45 for the first
time could very well be mean.

5388
02:20:53,051 --> 02:20:54,520
He looked real lean,

5389
02:20:54,790 --> 02:20:55,331
real lean.

5390
02:20:55,331 --> 02:20:58,540
Who knows how he felt doing
it for the first time.

5391
02:20:58,541 --> 02:20:59,560
It's probably real hard.

5392
02:20:59,600 --> 02:20:59,731
Yeah.

5393
02:20:59,731 --> 02:21:02,320
Is he doing it again or is
he going to go back up to 55?

5394
02:21:02,470 --> 02:21:03,161
I have not.

5395
02:21:03,161 --> 02:21:04,120
I have not heard.

5396
02:21:04,121 --> 02:21:05,260
I mean it may be out there,

5397
02:21:05,261 --> 02:21:05,830
but I have,

5398
02:21:05,830 --> 02:21:09,250
I haven't heard anything about it as
far as if he's going back to 55 and not,

5399
02:21:09,280 --> 02:21:10,360
what's the most you ever cut?

5400
02:21:12,150 --> 02:21:12,730
Um,

5401
02:21:12,730 --> 02:21:16,390
I didn't know what I was doing the first
time I made one 54 to five room and the

5402
02:21:16,391 --> 02:21:18,730
Sato I thought I caught
17 pounds in a day.

5403
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:19,550
Whoa.

5404
02:21:19,550 --> 02:21:20,383
Um,

5405
02:21:20,470 --> 02:21:21,520
that was ridiculous.

5406
02:21:21,940 --> 02:21:25,000
Did you have to fight day of
or day after next day after?

5407
02:21:25,330 --> 02:21:27,940
How'd you rehydrate ivy bags?

5408
02:21:28,070 --> 02:21:28,580
No,

5409
02:21:28,580 --> 02:21:29,480
I didn't.

5410
02:21:29,481 --> 02:21:30,680
I drank pedialyte.

5411
02:21:31,250 --> 02:21:32,210
Did it work?

5412
02:21:33,080 --> 02:21:33,471
I don't know.

5413
02:21:33,471 --> 02:21:34,880
The fight didn't last very long.

5414
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:35,390
It's on,

5415
02:21:35,390 --> 02:21:37,730
it's on fight pass and it's,

5416
02:21:37,731 --> 02:21:38,541
it's hard to see.

5417
02:21:38,541 --> 02:21:40,430
But as a fight happens,

5418
02:21:40,580 --> 02:21:42,740
I throw a jab and I hit Sato was,

5419
02:21:42,741 --> 02:21:43,574
he's coming in,

5420
02:21:43,610 --> 02:21:46,490
I turned his head over and bang,

5421
02:21:46,491 --> 02:21:51,140
as he's coming in we clash heads and I
go to my knees and I get up and I grabbed

5422
02:21:51,141 --> 02:21:53,960
the ropes and I'm just holding on to the
ropes and the ref is like screaming at

5423
02:21:53,961 --> 02:21:54,021
me,

5424
02:21:54,021 --> 02:21:54,531
slap my ass,

5425
02:21:54,531 --> 02:21:56,540
telling me to get off the ropes
and I'm just looking at him like,

5426
02:21:56,570 --> 02:21:57,470
what are you talking about?

5427
02:21:57,471 --> 02:22:00,900
And then he jumps on my back and he
starts choking and I'm fighting and I'm,

5428
02:22:00,920 --> 02:22:05,310
I'm falling back and one of the ropes
peels my hands off and he just thinks in,

5429
02:22:05,311 --> 02:22:07,670
the joke all happens in like 20 seconds.

5430
02:22:07,730 --> 02:22:08,300
Wow.

5431
02:22:08,300 --> 02:22:11,600
But like I like after
learning about rehydration,

5432
02:22:11,601 --> 02:22:11,760
yeah.

5433
02:22:11,760 --> 02:22:12,650
I didn't know anything.

5434
02:22:12,651 --> 02:22:14,460
This is like 1999 right now.

5435
02:22:14,750 --> 02:22:15,401
I have to learn.

5436
02:22:15,401 --> 02:22:17,030
And this is the first time I fought a 55,

5437
02:22:17,410 --> 02:22:18,243
um,

5438
02:22:18,620 --> 02:22:21,200
after learning about rehydration
and the brain and all that,

5439
02:22:21,201 --> 02:22:22,034
I'm like,

5440
02:22:22,040 --> 02:22:22,371
was,

5441
02:22:22,371 --> 02:22:23,750
was I out from that?

5442
02:22:23,810 --> 02:22:24,550
Like,

5443
02:22:24,550 --> 02:22:25,383
I,

5444
02:22:25,590 --> 02:22:26,010
this was when

5445
02:22:26,010 --> 02:22:26,521
I was a kid.

5446
02:22:26,521 --> 02:22:28,170
I don't care anymore about the result,

5447
02:22:28,530 --> 02:22:29,251
but I'm like,

5448
02:22:29,251 --> 02:22:30,150
was I out?

5449
02:22:30,240 --> 02:22:30,510
You know,

5450
02:22:30,510 --> 02:22:30,900
was I,

5451
02:22:30,900 --> 02:22:32,060
was I con semi con?

5452
02:22:32,100 --> 02:22:33,420
I don't remember any of that,

5453
02:22:33,421 --> 02:22:35,730
but I watch it on tape and I
see it and I know what happens,

5454
02:22:36,120 --> 02:22:37,890
but I don't know.

5455
02:22:38,310 --> 02:22:38,551
Yeah.

5456
02:22:38,551 --> 02:22:41,130
So you don't know how much of a weakened
state you were in because it was such a

5457
02:22:41,131 --> 02:22:41,780
quick fight.

5458
02:22:41,780 --> 02:22:43,320
You get a chance to assess how your body,

5459
02:22:43,410 --> 02:22:45,090
how did you feel like walking to the ring?

5460
02:22:45,091 --> 02:22:45,690
Do you remember?

5461
02:22:45,690 --> 02:22:47,010
I remember feeling good,

5462
02:22:47,070 --> 02:22:47,970
but I was,

5463
02:22:47,971 --> 02:22:48,330
uh,

5464
02:22:48,330 --> 02:22:48,721
I was,

5465
02:22:48,721 --> 02:22:49,500
uh,

5466
02:22:49,500 --> 02:22:52,860
20 something like 21
year old maybe fighting.

5467
02:22:53,490 --> 02:22:54,300
Um,

5468
02:22:54,300 --> 02:22:57,390
a guy who I look up to in a
main event in Hawaii on a,

5469
02:22:57,391 --> 02:22:57,901
on a show,

5470
02:22:57,901 --> 02:22:58,740
on super brawl.

5471
02:22:59,040 --> 02:22:59,620
You know,

5472
02:22:59,620 --> 02:22:59,880
we're,

5473
02:22:59,880 --> 02:23:01,080
we're all Super Bra.

5474
02:23:01,081 --> 02:23:03,060
Had some great fucking fights,

5475
02:23:03,061 --> 02:23:03,894
man.

5476
02:23:04,180 --> 02:23:04,770
Like,

5477
02:23:04,770 --> 02:23:05,010
that's,

5478
02:23:05,010 --> 02:23:06,000
that's old school,

5479
02:23:06,010 --> 02:23:06,843
you know,

5480
02:23:06,860 --> 02:23:09,030
remember Egan in your way versus mayhem?

5481
02:23:09,030 --> 02:23:09,430
Miller.

5482
02:23:09,430 --> 02:23:09,930
Oh,

5483
02:23:09,930 --> 02:23:10,800
Holy Shit.

5484
02:23:10,980 --> 02:23:11,481
You can get,

5485
02:23:11,481 --> 02:23:13,980
some may have in the Camorra
may keeps rolling out of it.

5486
02:23:14,020 --> 02:23:15,390
Those impossible joints.

5487
02:23:15,990 --> 02:23:18,550
Damn Bra fights.

5488
02:23:19,190 --> 02:23:21,780
It wasn't that v Tours
debut against John Hess.

5489
02:23:21,900 --> 02:23:22,430
Yep.

5490
02:23:22,430 --> 02:23:23,370
Ah,

5491
02:23:23,400 --> 02:23:25,060
Shaq was in the audience members.

5492
02:23:25,070 --> 02:23:25,940
Shaq jumps out.

5493
02:23:26,580 --> 02:23:28,350
I don't remember that veto or lit.

5494
02:23:28,351 --> 02:23:29,410
John has stopped.

5495
02:23:30,090 --> 02:23:33,420
That's when John House was like one of
the last remaining bullshit artists.

5496
02:23:33,620 --> 02:23:34,890
He was a safta guy.

5497
02:23:35,250 --> 02:23:36,660
Like street combat,

5498
02:23:36,661 --> 02:23:38,700
like one of those guys poking
people in the eyes and shit.

5499
02:23:38,701 --> 02:23:39,900
And that's what he basically did.

5500
02:23:40,170 --> 02:23:41,640
And his UFC debut,

5501
02:23:41,641 --> 02:23:43,590
he poked the shit out
of some guy he fought.

5502
02:23:43,900 --> 02:23:46,290
So he fought some short guy
and poked him in the eyes.

5503
02:23:46,520 --> 02:23:46,891
But yeah,

5504
02:23:46,891 --> 02:23:47,810
this is Victoria.

5505
02:23:47,970 --> 02:23:49,680
This is back up a little bit.

5506
02:23:50,810 --> 02:23:51,120
Yeah.

5507
02:23:51,120 --> 02:23:53,850
But just back up a little bit because
this is right before the fight starts.

5508
02:23:53,890 --> 02:23:54,360
Yeah.

5509
02:23:54,360 --> 02:23:55,193
Let it go here.

5510
02:23:55,530 --> 02:23:56,030
Oh,

5511
02:23:56,030 --> 02:23:57,270
it starts with a beating.

5512
02:23:57,710 --> 02:23:58,830
It was a weird video.

5513
02:23:59,160 --> 02:23:59,371
Oh,

5514
02:23:59,371 --> 02:24:00,030
okay.

5515
02:24:00,030 --> 02:24:00,863
Look at this.

5516
02:24:00,870 --> 02:24:01,111
Doom,

5517
02:24:01,111 --> 02:24:01,351
doom.

5518
02:24:01,351 --> 02:24:01,621
Doom.

5519
02:24:01,621 --> 02:24:02,940
Doom out.

5520
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:03,361
Yeah.

5521
02:24:03,361 --> 02:24:04,890
That was super fast.

5522
02:24:04,930 --> 02:24:05,281
You to her.

5523
02:24:05,281 --> 02:24:06,510
I was training with V tour then.

5524
02:24:06,600 --> 02:24:07,090
Oh yeah.

5525
02:24:07,090 --> 02:24:08,370
Vittores 19 years old,

5526
02:24:08,371 --> 02:24:08,850
man.

5527
02:24:08,850 --> 02:24:12,480
That's when I was at Carlson Gracie's on
Hawthorne is right down the street from

5528
02:24:12,481 --> 02:24:13,141
the comedy store.

5529
02:24:13,141 --> 02:24:13,530
Man,

5530
02:24:13,530 --> 02:24:17,810
I was so jealous to veto and that UFC
Brazil when he fought Vandelay cause that

5531
02:24:17,811 --> 02:24:19,170
was like this kid my age.

5532
02:24:19,171 --> 02:24:19,920
I agree with the saint.

5533
02:24:19,920 --> 02:24:20,940
Were born the same year,

5534
02:24:20,941 --> 02:24:21,930
I guess it was like he's my,

5535
02:24:21,970 --> 02:24:23,040
he's already in the UFC.

5536
02:24:23,310 --> 02:24:24,960
I wish I was 200 pounds.

5537
02:24:25,230 --> 02:24:29,040
Like I remember Rod Woodson
was this safety for,

5538
02:24:29,041 --> 02:24:31,260
for the Pittsburgh
Steelers and I was like,

5539
02:24:31,410 --> 02:24:33,330
he's five [inaudible]
nine 200 pounds cause I,

5540
02:24:33,331 --> 02:24:33,790
that would be,

5541
02:24:33,790 --> 02:24:35,640
they will only two
weight classes back then.

5542
02:24:35,690 --> 02:24:37,350
And this is when he tried telling me,

5543
02:24:37,410 --> 02:24:37,690
yeah,

5544
02:24:37,690 --> 02:24:38,360
he fought.

5545
02:24:38,360 --> 02:24:39,750
He was only 200 pounds back then.

5546
02:24:39,750 --> 02:24:40,380
Man,

5547
02:24:40,380 --> 02:24:43,820
when he fought in his UFC debut and he
beat the shit out of Scott for Ozo and it

5548
02:24:43,821 --> 02:24:48,821
was only 200 pounds and he was
shout readed just shredded was fast.

5549
02:24:50,670 --> 02:24:52,760
Was It v against Vandelay telegram?

5550
02:24:52,830 --> 02:24:55,410
Telegram was his debut
froze are right here.

5551
02:24:55,411 --> 02:24:56,700
That was the second fight of the night.

5552
02:24:56,820 --> 02:25:00,540
This is the first fight that
I worked in Alabama in 1997.

5553
02:25:00,630 --> 02:25:04,500
When did he fight Vandelay
and Vandelay and nice six?

5554
02:25:04,940 --> 02:25:05,340
No,

5555
02:25:05,340 --> 02:25:06,390
98 I think.

5556
02:25:07,290 --> 02:25:08,123
And uh,

5557
02:25:08,280 --> 02:25:10,080
ultimate ultimate buzz Brazil.

5558
02:25:10,620 --> 02:25:12,120
This is how he fought tank Abbott.

5559
02:25:12,270 --> 02:25:14,820
This was when [inaudible]
was getting bigger,

5560
02:25:15,240 --> 02:25:16,350
but he was still,

5561
02:25:16,950 --> 02:25:17,910
it was still fast.

5562
02:25:18,030 --> 02:25:22,560
He was like probably like two 15 or
two 20 then and then he fucked up tank

5563
02:25:22,561 --> 02:25:23,394
Abbott.

5564
02:25:23,560 --> 02:25:24,393
Um,

5565
02:25:24,400 --> 02:25:26,560
but then as he got older,

5566
02:25:28,150 --> 02:25:31,420
not older but later and see like
here he's still pretty jacked.

5567
02:25:31,690 --> 02:25:33,140
But then when he fought Randy coture,

5568
02:25:33,160 --> 02:25:33,510
he got,

5569
02:25:33,510 --> 02:25:34,840
remember this is Joe Charles.

5570
02:25:35,140 --> 02:25:37,930
That might've been effects
ever see that fight.

5571
02:25:38,210 --> 02:25:39,310
He didn't throw any punches.

5572
02:25:39,311 --> 02:25:43,360
They were friends and they just scrap
and got him in an arm bar that was like,

5573
02:25:43,361 --> 02:25:44,500
they kind of had a deal.

5574
02:25:44,940 --> 02:25:46,000
Here's the Vandelay fight.

5575
02:25:46,120 --> 02:25:46,860
You got to meet the,

5576
02:25:46,860 --> 02:25:51,160
remember the Vandelay fight was when he
had slimmed down cause after Randy had

5577
02:25:51,161 --> 02:25:52,000
already fucked him up.

5578
02:25:52,530 --> 02:25:53,111
It was after,

5579
02:25:53,111 --> 02:25:53,261
right?

5580
02:25:53,261 --> 02:25:53,591
Yeah.

5581
02:25:53,591 --> 02:25:54,010
Okay.

5582
02:25:54,010 --> 02:25:55,240
Well when Randy fought him,

5583
02:25:55,241 --> 02:25:58,180
veto was two 40 and he looked like a lion.

5584
02:25:58,181 --> 02:25:58,720
Yeah.

5585
02:25:58,720 --> 02:26:00,220
He didn't even look like a person.

5586
02:26:00,610 --> 02:26:02,530
See if he could find veto.

5587
02:26:02,560 --> 02:26:03,393
This is pride

5588
02:26:03,880 --> 02:26:05,140
picture of that a couple of weeks,

5589
02:26:05,200 --> 02:26:09,220
a couple months ago about Vitola at
that point before the Randy fight.

5590
02:26:09,890 --> 02:26:10,500
Yeah,

5591
02:26:10,500 --> 02:26:12,110
because he had no known weaknesses.

5592
02:26:12,500 --> 02:26:12,861
Right.

5593
02:26:12,861 --> 02:26:13,671
That's what it said.

5594
02:26:13,671 --> 02:26:14,780
No known weaknesses.

5595
02:26:14,781 --> 02:26:16,430
He lost a sock or rob in this fight.

5596
02:26:16,431 --> 02:26:17,270
He hurt his hand,

5597
02:26:17,930 --> 02:26:18,770
broke his hand early.

5598
02:26:18,771 --> 02:26:19,850
And this is also,

5599
02:26:19,851 --> 02:26:23,750
this is Vito or after is his
sister got kidnapped and murdered.

5600
02:26:24,470 --> 02:26:25,700
He was a different guy then.

5601
02:26:26,420 --> 02:26:29,040
Sakharov was so fucking tough too man.

5602
02:26:29,120 --> 02:26:31,250
Sakkara but just knew how to survive.

5603
02:26:31,970 --> 02:26:34,280
See if you could find
Vituro versus Randy couture.

5604
02:26:34,400 --> 02:26:37,220
Cause that's the crazy one when
you just look at his build.

5605
02:26:37,250 --> 02:26:37,700
Yeah,

5606
02:26:37,700 --> 02:26:39,260
he was so big man.

5607
02:26:40,900 --> 02:26:42,880
It's like his traps were
coming up to his ears.

5608
02:26:43,080 --> 02:26:43,171
Oh,

5609
02:26:43,171 --> 02:26:44,110
here it is right here.

5610
02:26:45,370 --> 02:26:46,660
This is him versus Randy.

5611
02:26:48,140 --> 02:26:50,480
So this might be says young Vitor Belfort.

5612
02:26:50,481 --> 02:26:52,320
So it's probably only going
to show you the good stuff.

5613
02:26:52,340 --> 02:26:53,173
Yes.

5614
02:26:53,310 --> 02:26:54,050
Yeah.

5615
02:26:54,050 --> 02:26:55,910
He was so thick back then,

5616
02:26:57,170 --> 02:26:59,570
but the thing I remember is
like how big his neck was.

5617
02:26:59,610 --> 02:27:03,350
Like it started at the top of his
head and worked its way down sideways,

5618
02:27:03,380 --> 02:27:04,610
a 40 degree angle.

5619
02:27:06,170 --> 02:27:07,580
Those are the wild west days,

5620
02:27:07,581 --> 02:27:08,270
man.

5621
02:27:08,270 --> 02:27:08,900
You know,

5622
02:27:08,900 --> 02:27:09,141
I mean,

5623
02:27:09,141 --> 02:27:10,790
how many guys did you
fight where you're like,

5624
02:27:10,820 --> 02:27:11,601
oh shit,

5625
02:27:11,601 --> 02:27:12,560
this dude's definitely on the,

5626
02:27:12,680 --> 02:27:13,513
on the juice.

5627
02:27:14,150 --> 02:27:15,700
I didn't even think about juice back down,

5628
02:27:15,710 --> 02:27:16,580
even know what it was.

5629
02:27:16,670 --> 02:27:17,091
I saw it.

5630
02:27:17,091 --> 02:27:17,871
I thought there's a,

5631
02:27:17,871 --> 02:27:19,130
there's a video on youtube.

5632
02:27:19,131 --> 02:27:20,210
I fought this guy,

5633
02:27:20,510 --> 02:27:23,270
so bas Rutten was coming
to Texas and I was like,

5634
02:27:23,330 --> 02:27:24,860
I was this huge Bosch Chute and fan.

5635
02:27:25,250 --> 02:27:25,731
And um,

5636
02:27:25,731 --> 02:27:26,960
he told my coach who's was coming,

5637
02:27:26,961 --> 02:27:28,190
I emailed my coach,

5638
02:27:28,191 --> 02:27:28,521
emailed,

5639
02:27:28,521 --> 02:27:31,310
he said I could be that he's supposed to
fight in Dallas that night I called the

5640
02:27:31,311 --> 02:27:34,040
guy up in Dallas because I had fought
for him before and he shorted me on some

5641
02:27:34,041 --> 02:27:34,610
money.

5642
02:27:34,610 --> 02:27:35,060
I was like,

5643
02:27:35,060 --> 02:27:35,990
I'm not coming up there,

5644
02:27:35,991 --> 02:27:36,261
man.

5645
02:27:36,261 --> 02:27:37,250
I'm not fighting for you.

5646
02:27:37,520 --> 02:27:39,650
And I went to this arena
where Bosch is going to be at.

5647
02:27:39,710 --> 02:27:40,521
And I told the guy,

5648
02:27:40,521 --> 02:27:40,940
hey,

5649
02:27:40,940 --> 02:27:41,500
anybody,

5650
02:27:41,500 --> 02:27:42,560
I walked into the rules meeting,

5651
02:27:42,561 --> 02:27:42,891
I was like,

5652
02:27:42,891 --> 02:27:43,970
if anybody doesn't have an opponent,

5653
02:27:43,971 --> 02:27:44,804
I'll fight.

5654
02:27:44,990 --> 02:27:45,201
And,

5655
02:27:45,201 --> 02:27:45,321
um,

5656
02:27:45,321 --> 02:27:50,321
they gave me a guy that was like two
something big Jack Dude at the big,

5657
02:27:50,990 --> 02:27:53,090
like a man and I was a child.

5658
02:27:54,140 --> 02:27:54,390
My,

5659
02:27:54,390 --> 02:27:55,221
my roommate was like,

5660
02:27:55,221 --> 02:27:55,371
Hey,

5661
02:27:55,371 --> 02:27:56,121
do you see your opponent?

5662
02:27:56,121 --> 02:27:56,601
I was like,

5663
02:27:56,601 --> 02:27:56,931
no.

5664
02:27:56,931 --> 02:27:57,710
He's like,

5665
02:27:57,710 --> 02:27:57,981
man,

5666
02:27:57,981 --> 02:28:00,640
he's like six [inaudible] two he's
probably like two twenties Jack.

5667
02:28:01,390 --> 02:28:02,170
And I was like,

5668
02:28:02,170 --> 02:28:02,990
and boss was like,

5669
02:28:02,990 --> 02:28:03,290
Eve,

5670
02:28:03,290 --> 02:28:03,560
eve,

5671
02:28:03,560 --> 02:28:03,801
eve,

5672
02:28:03,801 --> 02:28:04,490
he's drinking.

5673
02:28:04,490 --> 02:28:04,910
He's like,

5674
02:28:04,910 --> 02:28:05,390
Eve,

5675
02:28:05,390 --> 02:28:07,280
you got there and you fight and you win.

5676
02:28:07,430 --> 02:28:08,263
I going to be like,

5677
02:28:08,580 --> 02:28:09,413
yeah,

5678
02:28:09,830 --> 02:28:10,251
you fight.

5679
02:28:10,251 --> 02:28:11,084
Then you lose.

5680
02:28:11,180 --> 02:28:12,013
I'm going to be like,

5681
02:28:12,240 --> 02:28:13,073
yeah,

5682
02:28:13,810 --> 02:28:14,471
fuck these people.

5683
02:28:14,471 --> 02:28:16,000
They don't understand what
it takes to get in there.

5684
02:28:16,001 --> 02:28:16,930
You don't worry about it.

5685
02:28:17,050 --> 02:28:17,900
I little corny.

5686
02:28:18,580 --> 02:28:19,413
I was like,

5687
02:28:19,480 --> 02:28:20,500
I was so excited.

5688
02:28:20,760 --> 02:28:21,980
It was the coolest fucking thing in the

5689
02:28:21,980 --> 02:28:22,813
world.

5690
02:28:22,890 --> 02:28:24,470
Just haven't boss in your corner.

5691
02:28:24,980 --> 02:28:25,701
That's gotta be what,

5692
02:28:25,701 --> 02:28:26,900
a motivating factor that is.

5693
02:28:27,480 --> 02:28:28,070
Right.

5694
02:28:28,070 --> 02:28:28,903
Like I,

5695
02:28:28,910 --> 02:28:29,250
I,

5696
02:28:29,250 --> 02:28:32,510
I was as excited kid was watching
all these pancreas videos.

5697
02:28:32,690 --> 02:28:33,830
I had pictures of my,

5698
02:28:33,840 --> 02:28:37,790
I had before I even knew the guy before
I had any idea possibly meet him.

5699
02:28:38,090 --> 02:28:40,650
I have pictures of myself doing
that double front kick in my head.

5700
02:28:42,080 --> 02:28:42,711
I still have them.

5701
02:28:42,711 --> 02:28:43,544
It's horrible.

5702
02:28:43,610 --> 02:28:44,810
But I'm like,

5703
02:28:44,811 --> 02:28:45,870
and then I meet the guy and he's,

5704
02:28:45,871 --> 02:28:47,350
he's willing to corner me and whatnot.

5705
02:28:47,390 --> 02:28:48,150
Yeah,

5706
02:28:48,150 --> 02:28:48,330
I'll,

5707
02:28:48,330 --> 02:28:48,620
I'll,

5708
02:28:48,620 --> 02:28:49,670
I'll fight anybody.

5709
02:28:49,860 --> 02:28:50,541
That's incredible.

5710
02:28:50,541 --> 02:28:52,940
It's like Dan Severn that seven was like,

5711
02:28:52,941 --> 02:28:54,380
I'll fight him right now,

5712
02:28:54,790 --> 02:28:55,770
although in a bottle.

5713
02:28:56,360 --> 02:28:57,320
That's incredible.

5714
02:28:58,050 --> 02:28:59,210
That's good man.

5715
02:28:59,270 --> 02:29:00,103
I am.

5716
02:29:01,070 --> 02:29:01,670
Yeah.

5717
02:29:01,670 --> 02:29:02,450
Sorry.

5718
02:29:02,450 --> 02:29:03,530
You taking me back.

5719
02:29:03,590 --> 02:29:04,131
Damn man.

5720
02:29:04,131 --> 02:29:04,520
Books.

5721
02:29:04,520 --> 02:29:08,510
That's one of the beautiful things about
MMA is that especially with the garlic

5722
02:29:08,511 --> 02:29:08,810
use it,

5723
02:29:08,810 --> 02:29:09,470
you were there for them.

5724
02:29:09,470 --> 02:29:11,030
Be really at the beginning,

5725
02:29:11,031 --> 02:29:11,781
like the early,

5726
02:29:11,781 --> 02:29:12,171
early,

5727
02:29:12,171 --> 02:29:12,861
early days.

5728
02:29:12,861 --> 02:29:13,161
Man,

5729
02:29:13,161 --> 02:29:14,570
you were there when there was no money,

5730
02:29:15,020 --> 02:29:15,291
you know,

5731
02:29:15,291 --> 02:29:16,490
no notoriety,

5732
02:29:16,491 --> 02:29:17,360
no nothing.

5733
02:29:18,560 --> 02:29:18,891
Yeah.

5734
02:29:18,891 --> 02:29:19,221
Five,

5735
02:29:19,221 --> 02:29:20,150
five shows a year.

5736
02:29:20,180 --> 02:29:20,931
That type of stuff.

5737
02:29:20,931 --> 02:29:25,550
Like Josh Thomson posted a picture a
couple of days ago of him and Hermes and

5738
02:29:25,910 --> 02:29:26,750
Hermes Franco.

5739
02:29:26,780 --> 02:29:27,440
Yeah.

5740
02:29:27,440 --> 02:29:28,480
I forgot about that dude.

5741
02:29:28,490 --> 02:29:28,820
That was,

5742
02:29:28,820 --> 02:29:29,091
that was,

5743
02:29:29,091 --> 02:29:29,901
that was a good fight.

5744
02:29:29,901 --> 02:29:31,550
I remember watching
that and thinking like,

5745
02:29:31,551 --> 02:29:31,901
Josh,

5746
02:29:31,901 --> 02:29:35,390
has he posted something about that fight
should have made him the number one guy

5747
02:29:35,750 --> 02:29:37,940
because like we were
the guys at that point.

5748
02:29:37,970 --> 02:29:38,210
Yeah.

5749
02:29:38,210 --> 02:29:41,060
Armies and Josh and when he beat Hermes,

5750
02:29:41,360 --> 02:29:41,840
I was like,

5751
02:29:41,840 --> 02:29:43,100
I got to fight these guys.

5752
02:29:43,520 --> 02:29:44,810
These are the guys I want to fight.

5753
02:29:44,840 --> 02:29:46,850
And then I fought Hermes
and then it was like,

5754
02:29:46,851 --> 02:29:47,330
that's it.

5755
02:29:47,330 --> 02:29:49,370
It's just Josh and I,

5756
02:29:49,371 --> 02:29:50,240
we got to do this,

5757
02:29:50,720 --> 02:29:51,290
you know,

5758
02:29:51,290 --> 02:29:52,123
um,

5759
02:29:52,250 --> 02:29:55,350
that highlight kick that you
landed on him to his work,

5760
02:29:55,370 --> 02:30:00,370
one of those UFC preflight
video highlight reel thing.

5761
02:30:00,440 --> 02:30:01,340
They would play with that.

5762
02:30:01,400 --> 02:30:03,020
The WHO Song?

5763
02:30:03,060 --> 02:30:03,361
Yeah.

5764
02:30:03,361 --> 02:30:05,810
The Baba Baba O'reilly would play.

5765
02:30:05,811 --> 02:30:08,990
And then you would land that
jumping roundhouse kick to the neck.

5766
02:30:09,440 --> 02:30:11,450
That was a crazy highlight reel.

5767
02:30:11,510 --> 02:30:12,800
Kao Finished Man.

5768
02:30:13,040 --> 02:30:13,361
No,

5769
02:30:13,361 --> 02:30:14,960
that was just old school.

5770
02:30:14,961 --> 02:30:15,621
Good Times.

5771
02:30:15,621 --> 02:30:16,300
You know,

5772
02:30:16,300 --> 02:30:17,030
like those,

5773
02:30:17,030 --> 02:30:19,490
those are the guys that I
remember those those days.

5774
02:30:19,491 --> 02:30:21,140
I remember when they had
that tournament with,

5775
02:30:21,141 --> 02:30:21,800
um,

5776
02:30:21,800 --> 02:30:24,680
with Dean and Uno and Matt and,

5777
02:30:24,681 --> 02:30:25,514
um,

5778
02:30:25,790 --> 02:30:26,840
who's the third guy?

5779
02:30:26,930 --> 02:30:27,730
Bj.

5780
02:30:27,730 --> 02:30:28,330
Mm.

5781
02:30:28,330 --> 02:30:29,900
And they had that tournament for the belt.

5782
02:30:29,901 --> 02:30:30,770
And I was like,

5783
02:30:30,860 --> 02:30:32,180
why am I not in this tournament?

5784
02:30:32,181 --> 02:30:32,751
I was angry.

5785
02:30:32,751 --> 02:30:33,051
I was,

5786
02:30:33,051 --> 02:30:33,591
I was young.

5787
02:30:33,591 --> 02:30:35,900
I had a little bit less
fights than dean at the time.

5788
02:30:36,460 --> 02:30:37,160
Um,

5789
02:30:37,160 --> 02:30:38,780
little less experienced
at that high level.

5790
02:30:38,781 --> 02:30:39,500
Anyway,

5791
02:30:39,500 --> 02:30:40,370
and I was just like,

5792
02:30:40,610 --> 02:30:41,540
I can fight these guys.

5793
02:30:41,541 --> 02:30:42,530
It could beat these guys.

5794
02:30:42,531 --> 02:30:44,360
I had just lost the decision at uno.

5795
02:30:44,600 --> 02:30:45,021
It's like,

5796
02:30:45,021 --> 02:30:45,410
yeah,

5797
02:30:45,410 --> 02:30:45,831
I know.

5798
02:30:45,831 --> 02:30:47,120
I know how to be on this level.

5799
02:30:47,300 --> 02:30:47,961
I should be in this.

5800
02:30:47,961 --> 02:30:51,020
I was so pissed and I'm no,

5801
02:30:51,021 --> 02:30:52,280
I remember those days man.

5802
02:30:52,281 --> 02:30:52,550
Those,

5803
02:30:52,550 --> 02:30:53,383
those,

5804
02:30:54,010 --> 02:30:54,380
it's,

5805
02:30:54,380 --> 02:30:55,550
it's fun thinking about them.

5806
02:30:55,551 --> 02:30:58,820
It's fun going back and watching
the whole card because like you,

5807
02:30:58,821 --> 02:31:00,410
you started getting these memories of,

5808
02:31:00,411 --> 02:31:02,660
of being around that and
preparing for those days,

5809
02:31:02,870 --> 02:31:06,230
being on the card and
seeing those guys and um,

5810
02:31:06,260 --> 02:31:06,561
you know,

5811
02:31:06,561 --> 02:31:07,850
the fights were like in Bolger city,

5812
02:31:07,851 --> 02:31:08,684
Louisiana,

5813
02:31:09,140 --> 02:31:09,650
you know,

5814
02:31:09,650 --> 02:31:10,640
some small,

5815
02:31:10,820 --> 02:31:11,810
small town,

5816
02:31:11,930 --> 02:31:15,890
the small arenas where I'm close
to Texas families driving over.

5817
02:31:16,640 --> 02:31:18,410
And then when I first
went to Vegas to fight,

5818
02:31:18,590 --> 02:31:18,930
man,

5819
02:31:18,930 --> 02:31:20,250
that first fight in Vegas

5820
02:31:20,550 --> 02:31:21,990
was right after nine 11.

5821
02:31:23,070 --> 02:31:23,790
Empty.

5822
02:31:23,790 --> 02:31:26,760
The casinos were m I remember
that does when Tito Ortiz,

5823
02:31:26,761 --> 02:31:27,061
fod,

5824
02:31:27,061 --> 02:31:28,920
Vladimir Mount your Shank Schenkel yeah,

5825
02:31:29,190 --> 02:31:29,940
I remember that.

5826
02:31:29,940 --> 02:31:30,840
That was there for that.

5827
02:31:30,870 --> 02:31:31,380
Yeah.

5828
02:31:31,380 --> 02:31:32,820
I wasn't even working for the UFC then.

5829
02:31:33,090 --> 02:31:33,540
No,

5830
02:31:33,540 --> 02:31:34,373
no,

5831
02:31:34,620 --> 02:31:34,771
no.

5832
02:31:34,771 --> 02:31:35,820
I was there as a guest.

5833
02:31:36,240 --> 02:31:39,840
I was there watching and that's
one of them are Blotnick was there.

5834
02:31:39,900 --> 02:31:40,710
Yeah.

5835
02:31:40,710 --> 02:31:43,350
One of the ways I got
the job was by become,

5836
02:31:43,410 --> 02:31:47,190
I became friends with Dana and Dana and
I would like go to dinner and I started

5837
02:31:47,191 --> 02:31:48,270
asking them questions.

5838
02:31:48,510 --> 02:31:49,051
You know,

5839
02:31:49,051 --> 02:31:49,251
I'm,

5840
02:31:49,251 --> 02:31:49,850
I'm like,

5841
02:31:49,850 --> 02:31:49,991
you,

5842
02:31:49,991 --> 02:31:53,550
have you ever seen kinky pseudo ever
seen this guy you were talking about this

5843
02:31:53,551 --> 02:31:53,970
guy?

5844
02:31:53,970 --> 02:31:54,180
He did.

5845
02:31:54,180 --> 02:31:56,790
She tried to do is get some of
those kick k one guy to come over.

5846
02:31:57,010 --> 02:31:59,670
I would just be telling him
all this shit about fighting.

5847
02:31:59,671 --> 02:32:00,130
And he was like,

5848
02:32:00,130 --> 02:32:01,380
you want it to commentary.

5849
02:32:01,810 --> 02:32:02,221
It was like,

5850
02:32:02,221 --> 02:32:02,971
I don't want to work,

5851
02:32:02,971 --> 02:32:03,804
man.

5852
02:32:03,930 --> 02:32:05,040
He talked me into doing it.

5853
02:32:05,330 --> 02:32:05,660
That's,

5854
02:32:05,660 --> 02:32:08,970
that's literally how it happened to
come in friends with him talking to him.

5855
02:32:09,200 --> 02:32:09,330
Oh,

5856
02:32:09,330 --> 02:32:10,260
when he found some old,

5857
02:32:10,770 --> 02:32:14,250
he found a video of me on
the Keenan Ivory Wayans show,

5858
02:32:14,550 --> 02:32:15,840
talking shit about,

5859
02:32:15,860 --> 02:32:16,050
uh,

5860
02:32:16,050 --> 02:32:18,390
what would happen if Steven
Seagal fought in the octagon?

5861
02:32:18,520 --> 02:32:19,353
Yeah,

5862
02:32:19,760 --> 02:32:24,060
because I vaguely remember that Katelyn
had been in some movie with Steven

5863
02:32:24,060 --> 02:32:24,090
Seagal.

5864
02:32:24,090 --> 02:32:25,680
I was fucking with him about the movie.

5865
02:32:26,520 --> 02:32:29,460
I just was just joking
around and marketing it.

5866
02:32:30,030 --> 02:32:33,300
I remember those rumors of you
and Wesley snipes getting in.

5867
02:32:33,510 --> 02:32:34,560
That was supposed to happen.

5868
02:32:34,650 --> 02:32:35,580
I should have happened.

5869
02:32:36,360 --> 02:32:37,410
I think he just needed money,

5870
02:32:37,411 --> 02:32:37,830
man.

5871
02:32:37,830 --> 02:32:39,540
I think he just needed tax money,

5872
02:32:40,030 --> 02:32:40,590
you know,

5873
02:32:40,590 --> 02:32:44,160
and it was at a point in my life
where I was just dumb enough to do it.

5874
02:32:44,220 --> 02:32:45,053
I was like,

5875
02:32:45,090 --> 02:32:45,960
I'll do this.

5876
02:32:46,330 --> 02:32:46,801
And I was like,

5877
02:32:46,801 --> 02:32:46,981
man,

5878
02:32:46,981 --> 02:32:47,251
let's do it.

5879
02:32:47,251 --> 02:32:48,660
Got Tapped out by Andy Dick wet.

5880
02:32:50,370 --> 02:32:52,620
I got tickled out this,

5881
02:32:52,621 --> 02:32:54,600
that tickling doesn't work right?

5882
02:32:54,650 --> 02:32:54,950
No.

5883
02:32:54,950 --> 02:32:56,070
Never done that in a fight.

5884
02:32:56,071 --> 02:32:57,690
Like you even feel it in a fight.

5885
02:32:58,560 --> 02:32:59,580
You wouldn't even feel it.

5886
02:32:59,890 --> 02:33:01,470
Like if someone like wasted time,

5887
02:33:01,471 --> 02:33:02,450
like Kumu,

5888
02:33:02,480 --> 02:33:02,880
Kumu,

5889
02:33:02,880 --> 02:33:05,040
you just hit him right in the mouth.

5890
02:33:06,390 --> 02:33:09,960
Imagine if someone like was so ticklish
that you could open up a submission,

5891
02:33:10,500 --> 02:33:13,170
like a ticklish ticklish tennis
could open up a submission.

5892
02:33:13,560 --> 02:33:14,220
That's hard.

5893
02:33:14,220 --> 02:33:14,801
You know what you,

5894
02:33:14,801 --> 02:33:15,810
you might be like,

5895
02:33:15,811 --> 02:33:17,850
if someone's turtled up
knowing you're going back,

5896
02:33:17,851 --> 02:33:19,200
you can hit that rib tickle.

5897
02:33:19,240 --> 02:33:19,870
Right.

5898
02:33:19,870 --> 02:33:22,350
I'm going to try that
in the gym and the gym.

5899
02:33:22,351 --> 02:33:23,250
It might work.

5900
02:33:23,570 --> 02:33:26,340
I'm gonna try to rip decal so many in
the gym when I get them back next time.

5901
02:33:26,400 --> 02:33:27,151
Is Anybody,

5902
02:33:27,151 --> 02:33:27,900
here's a question.

5903
02:33:27,900 --> 02:33:31,440
Does anybody ever knocked the guy out
where someone's on your back and you hit

5904
02:33:31,441 --> 02:33:32,700
on with one of these and knock them out?

5905
02:33:32,840 --> 02:33:33,780
I have never seen that.

5906
02:33:33,810 --> 02:33:34,710
I've never seen it either,

5907
02:33:35,100 --> 02:33:36,930
but I've seen people keep trying it.

5908
02:33:37,230 --> 02:33:38,220
They keep trying it.

5909
02:33:39,510 --> 02:33:39,990
Right.

5910
02:33:39,990 --> 02:33:42,540
I don't think anybody's ever
knocked anybody out with that.

5911
02:33:42,541 --> 02:33:43,860
Like can you practice that?

5912
02:33:43,950 --> 02:33:48,690
Like could you get a guide to do ride
your back with the pads on and he would

5913
02:33:48,691 --> 02:33:50,400
hold up pads and you had fucking,

5914
02:33:52,820 --> 02:33:54,240
it sounds dumb as shit.

5915
02:33:54,300 --> 02:33:55,260
Sounds dumb as shit.

5916
02:33:55,320 --> 02:33:55,650
Yeah.

5917
02:33:55,650 --> 02:33:56,483
Right.

5918
02:33:56,880 --> 02:33:57,220
Yeah,

5919
02:33:57,220 --> 02:33:57,930
I would,

5920
02:33:57,930 --> 02:33:58,763
I wouldn't do that.

5921
02:33:58,800 --> 02:33:59,191
I should know.

5922
02:33:59,191 --> 02:34:01,830
What does work that you
can't do headbutting.

5923
02:34:02,280 --> 02:34:02,940
Yeah.

5924
02:34:02,940 --> 02:34:06,690
Like if a guy's on your back and if
you've got risk control and you smash your

5925
02:34:06,691 --> 02:34:07,550
head into his head,

5926
02:34:07,551 --> 02:34:09,420
that is a legitimate technique.

5927
02:34:09,660 --> 02:34:12,240
You're smashing the back of
your head and knew his nose.

5928
02:34:12,420 --> 02:34:13,253
That's legit.

5929
02:34:13,260 --> 02:34:13,860
Yeah,

5930
02:34:13,860 --> 02:34:14,693
that's legit.

5931
02:34:15,750 --> 02:34:18,220
But it's a headbutts headbutts illegal,

5932
02:34:19,120 --> 02:34:20,470
but it opens up a rear naked.

5933
02:34:21,100 --> 02:34:21,933
Yeah.

5934
02:34:22,180 --> 02:34:23,440
But it's a good,

5935
02:34:23,590 --> 02:34:25,420
it's not the best defense.

5936
02:34:25,421 --> 02:34:27,600
The best defense is
proper Jujitsu defense.

5937
02:34:27,630 --> 02:34:31,840
But there's something to headbutting
someone who's got your back that it's

5938
02:34:31,841 --> 02:34:33,130
another thing they have to think about.

5939
02:34:33,160 --> 02:34:33,940
Yeah.

5940
02:34:33,940 --> 02:34:35,890
But if you lot headbutts,

5941
02:34:35,920 --> 02:34:39,370
then you would allow the ultimate
move from the runic a choke position,

5942
02:34:39,371 --> 02:34:41,320
which is him elbow and you
in the back of the head.

5943
02:34:41,680 --> 02:34:42,820
That's the ultimate move.

5944
02:34:42,840 --> 02:34:43,390
Yeah.

5945
02:34:43,390 --> 02:34:45,040
That changes the whole position.

5946
02:34:45,340 --> 02:34:45,611
Yeah.

5947
02:34:45,611 --> 02:34:50,140
But also headbutts changed the guard
position to remember Mark Coleman when he

5948
02:34:50,141 --> 02:34:54,130
fought Maury Smith and those old days
Coleman would get on top of guys and just

5949
02:34:54,131 --> 02:34:55,980
smash his fucking head
right into your nose.

5950
02:34:55,990 --> 02:34:56,361
It was a,

5951
02:34:56,361 --> 02:35:00,820
there was an event on it from Australia
from way back in the day from I think

5952
02:35:00,821 --> 02:35:02,020
the late nineties where this guy,

5953
02:35:02,021 --> 02:35:05,020
one one and one of one of his fights
in the tournament and maybe a couple of

5954
02:35:05,021 --> 02:35:05,770
fights,

5955
02:35:05,770 --> 02:35:06,603
um,

5956
02:35:06,640 --> 02:35:08,380
from inside the guide head buddy.

5957
02:35:08,560 --> 02:35:09,100
Whoa.

5958
02:35:09,100 --> 02:35:09,911
And then I remember that,

5959
02:35:09,911 --> 02:35:13,000
I remember the guy who put his chin
in the guy's eye socket marker.

5960
02:35:13,420 --> 02:35:14,020
That was Kurt.

5961
02:35:14,020 --> 02:35:14,650
Kurt did that.

5962
02:35:14,650 --> 02:35:15,190
Okay.

5963
02:35:15,190 --> 02:35:17,860
Dan mobish fought Dan Boba fish,

5964
02:35:18,040 --> 02:35:19,030
got on top of them,

5965
02:35:19,031 --> 02:35:20,140
got the back of his head,

5966
02:35:20,141 --> 02:35:23,440
stuffed his chin and his eye socket
and lifted up the back of his head,

5967
02:35:23,520 --> 02:35:26,740
crushed his chin into his eyeball Ui.

5968
02:35:26,770 --> 02:35:27,603
That's gross.

5969
02:35:27,700 --> 02:35:29,080
That's as gross as it gets.

5970
02:35:29,170 --> 02:35:30,003
It's horrible.

5971
02:35:30,060 --> 02:35:30,680
Yeah man.

5972
02:35:30,680 --> 02:35:31,010
You see,

5973
02:35:31,010 --> 02:35:31,811
I seen a lot of,

5974
02:35:31,811 --> 02:35:33,130
I've seen a lot of those,

5975
02:35:33,160 --> 02:35:33,521
you know,

5976
02:35:33,521 --> 02:35:34,301
from the old school,

5977
02:35:34,301 --> 02:35:38,320
you see there was these things that would
happen that would never happen today.

5978
02:35:38,710 --> 02:35:39,071
You know,

5979
02:35:39,071 --> 02:35:39,171
and,

5980
02:35:39,171 --> 02:35:39,970
and it's,

5981
02:35:39,970 --> 02:35:42,550
it's fun to watch some of that
old stuff and grew this guy.

5982
02:35:43,480 --> 02:35:43,960
He's just,

5983
02:35:43,960 --> 02:35:44,793
he's just running,

5984
02:35:45,340 --> 02:35:46,060
running in.

5985
02:35:46,060 --> 02:35:46,421
Wow.

5986
02:35:46,421 --> 02:35:47,290
That's crazy.

5987
02:35:47,680 --> 02:35:48,490
Is that going to work?

5988
02:35:48,490 --> 02:35:49,500
That's only tech tar.

5989
02:35:49,540 --> 02:35:50,373
And it looks like it.

5990
02:35:51,120 --> 02:35:52,480
And the right for a second.

5991
02:35:52,481 --> 02:35:53,980
I thought it was old leg right?

5992
02:35:53,981 --> 02:35:54,521
And he had no,

5993
02:35:54,521 --> 02:35:56,980
he would never do something that that's,

5994
02:35:56,981 --> 02:35:57,311
that's,

5995
02:35:57,311 --> 02:35:59,280
that's a question I like to ask young.

5996
02:35:59,290 --> 02:35:59,650
Like,

5997
02:35:59,650 --> 02:35:59,951
you know,

5998
02:35:59,951 --> 02:36:01,810
like when they ask them rappers,

5999
02:36:01,811 --> 02:36:02,250
what do you think?

6000
02:36:02,250 --> 02:36:03,083
Run DMC,

6001
02:36:03,370 --> 02:36:04,060
right?

6002
02:36:04,060 --> 02:36:04,691
That's a question.

6003
02:36:04,691 --> 02:36:06,940
That's a name that I'll drop
one in young fighters like,

6004
02:36:06,950 --> 02:36:07,021
oh,

6005
02:36:07,021 --> 02:36:09,400
like duck taller over Jerry
Boone Landry or some jewelry.

6006
02:36:09,510 --> 02:36:12,640
Polander know Jerry bull
and it became a cop.

6007
02:36:12,760 --> 02:36:13,593
Yeah.

6008
02:36:14,200 --> 02:36:15,740
Wilson Kobe became a cop too.

6009
02:36:16,120 --> 02:36:16,953
Yeah.

6010
02:36:16,960 --> 02:36:18,040
He's like Swat Cop.

6011
02:36:18,220 --> 02:36:18,880
No Shit.

6012
02:36:18,880 --> 02:36:19,600
Yeah.

6013
02:36:19,600 --> 02:36:22,630
He's a talented guy and he's like one
of the baddest Swat cops on the force

6014
02:36:22,631 --> 02:36:22,990
right here.

6015
02:36:22,990 --> 02:36:23,200
Yeah.

6016
02:36:23,200 --> 02:36:25,630
I would imagine he was a talented guy.

6017
02:36:25,670 --> 02:36:26,080
Yeah.

6018
02:36:26,080 --> 02:36:28,120
He was the guy that I was Kinda surprised,

6019
02:36:28,121 --> 02:36:28,990
didn't go further.

6020
02:36:29,500 --> 02:36:32,770
Wilson was one of those guys who I believe

6021
02:36:34,510 --> 02:36:39,510
couldn't put it together inside the
octagon as well as he could in the gym and

6022
02:36:40,991 --> 02:36:42,990
also had a little bit,

6023
02:36:42,991 --> 02:36:45,730
he could have put more
effort into preparing.

6024
02:36:47,020 --> 02:36:48,640
Well that's oftentimes the case.

6025
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:53,980
The difference between someone who just
does fantastic and someone who just

6026
02:36:53,981 --> 02:36:56,260
doesn't quite just someone
who falls off short.

6027
02:36:56,390 --> 02:36:56,890
Yeah.

6028
02:36:56,890 --> 02:36:58,810
I think it also comes from like,

6029
02:36:58,840 --> 02:36:59,261
you know,

6030
02:36:59,261 --> 02:36:59,700
the,

6031
02:36:59,700 --> 02:37:00,850
the way you come up in the sport.

6032
02:37:01,140 --> 02:37:01,660
Um,

6033
02:37:01,660 --> 02:37:02,321
some of these guys,

6034
02:37:02,321 --> 02:37:04,060
they come up and they're
the best guy in their,

6035
02:37:04,061 --> 02:37:05,380
in their area for a long time.

6036
02:37:05,710 --> 02:37:06,180
And,

6037
02:37:06,180 --> 02:37:07,013
um,

6038
02:37:07,760 --> 02:37:10,270
you kind of get this attitude or this,

6039
02:37:10,630 --> 02:37:12,340
you started developing
this persona of like,

6040
02:37:12,341 --> 02:37:14,550
I don't have to do all
that work because like I,

6041
02:37:14,570 --> 02:37:16,040
I'm not even doing that much and I'm

6042
02:37:16,040 --> 02:37:17,810
still smashing everybody in here.

6043
02:37:18,260 --> 02:37:19,660
Well that's where it's
crazy about the garlic.

6044
02:37:19,680 --> 02:37:20,513
John Jones.

6045
02:37:20,840 --> 02:37:21,740
He actually can do that.

6046
02:37:21,780 --> 02:37:22,420
Yeah,

6047
02:37:22,420 --> 02:37:23,220
right.

6048
02:37:23,220 --> 02:37:26,540
He's one of the rare guys
that actually can do that.

6049
02:37:26,541 --> 02:37:27,170
Man.

6050
02:37:27,170 --> 02:37:28,003
I like,

6051
02:37:28,340 --> 02:37:31,150
I wonder how much money
he's left on the table with,

6052
02:37:31,151 --> 02:37:32,240
with all these problems,

6053
02:37:32,241 --> 02:37:36,980
especially with the tension that Khan
has brought to the sport and a guy like

6054
02:37:36,981 --> 02:37:37,940
Jon Jones.

6055
02:37:37,970 --> 02:37:38,630
Yeah.

6056
02:37:38,630 --> 02:37:39,320
You know,

6057
02:37:39,320 --> 02:37:44,320
I know it's good as he is good as he
is and I feel like for the longest time

6058
02:37:45,441 --> 02:37:45,661
too,

6059
02:37:45,661 --> 02:37:49,460
he was trying to push this goody two
shoes image and everybody was like,

6060
02:37:49,461 --> 02:37:50,294
well that's not you.

6061
02:37:50,540 --> 02:37:51,380
This is fake.

6062
02:37:51,440 --> 02:37:55,490
And then all of his problems sort of
forced him to just be himself and then

6063
02:37:55,491 --> 02:37:55,851
people were like,

6064
02:37:55,851 --> 02:37:56,870
we like you worn out.

6065
02:37:57,500 --> 02:38:00,260
And then he winds up testing
positive for something else,

6066
02:38:00,470 --> 02:38:01,640
which I believe him,

6067
02:38:01,730 --> 02:38:02,990
it was accidental.

6068
02:38:03,260 --> 02:38:06,140
I believe that it was accidental in this,

6069
02:38:06,141 --> 02:38:06,681
in this case,

6070
02:38:06,681 --> 02:38:08,960
because it doesn't make
any sense any other way.

6071
02:38:09,230 --> 02:38:14,150
Because if you look at how
he tested positive in what
he tested positive for and

6072
02:38:14,151 --> 02:38:18,500
how recently tested negative before that
and how recently afterwards he tested

6073
02:38:18,501 --> 02:38:19,160
negative,

6074
02:38:19,160 --> 02:38:22,430
you're talking about something that
was a such a minuscule trace amount,

6075
02:38:22,431 --> 02:38:25,730
there's no way you can consider taking
something like that and having it to have

6076
02:38:25,731 --> 02:38:27,950
some sort of positive effect,

6077
02:38:28,430 --> 02:38:29,540
performance enhancing effect.

6078
02:38:29,570 --> 02:38:32,990
Now was that the substance?

6079
02:38:32,991 --> 02:38:33,824
Is it oral?

6080
02:38:33,830 --> 02:38:35,770
Is it can be taken away
or it can be taken orally.

6081
02:38:36,170 --> 02:38:37,580
So I've heard,

6082
02:38:37,640 --> 02:38:38,121
I've heard,

6083
02:38:38,121 --> 02:38:39,650
and I don't know how true this is,

6084
02:38:39,710 --> 02:38:41,930
I would expect it to be somewhat true,

6085
02:38:42,080 --> 02:38:43,340
but I've heard like in boxing,

6086
02:38:43,670 --> 02:38:44,091
you know,

6087
02:38:44,091 --> 02:38:44,351
you,

6088
02:38:44,351 --> 02:38:45,030
you,

6089
02:38:45,030 --> 02:38:45,680
um,

6090
02:38:45,680 --> 02:38:46,550
main vendors,

6091
02:38:46,700 --> 02:38:47,450
they've had these,

6092
02:38:47,450 --> 02:38:49,490
these issues where they would only,

6093
02:38:49,520 --> 02:38:52,970
they would provide their own food
because they don't trust the staff for

6094
02:38:52,971 --> 02:38:53,541
somebody,

6095
02:38:53,541 --> 02:38:54,260
you know,

6096
02:38:54,260 --> 02:38:55,430
spiking their food with something.

6097
02:38:55,430 --> 02:38:56,263
So they test.

6098
02:38:56,570 --> 02:38:58,370
So I don't,

6099
02:38:58,371 --> 02:38:58,730
um,

6100
02:38:58,730 --> 02:39:00,560
I mean that sounds far fetched,

6101
02:39:00,561 --> 02:39:03,290
but it also sounds to
some degree reasonable.

6102
02:39:03,920 --> 02:39:04,400
Um,

6103
02:39:04,400 --> 02:39:07,820
his position was weakened by his
testimony in the California State Athletic

6104
02:39:07,821 --> 02:39:08,870
Commission hearing because,

6105
02:39:09,390 --> 02:39:09,980
um,

6106
02:39:09,980 --> 02:39:10,371
first of all,

6107
02:39:10,371 --> 02:39:14,720
he said that Malki had
forged his signature on one
of the documents on one of

6108
02:39:14,721 --> 02:39:16,460
the things that he was
supposed to have gone over.

6109
02:39:16,461 --> 02:39:17,480
Like what you can and can't,

6110
02:39:17,510 --> 02:39:17,721
I don't know.

6111
02:39:17,721 --> 02:39:18,201
I think it was a,

6112
02:39:18,201 --> 02:39:21,920
you saw the paperwork or maybe
it was California state athletic,

6113
02:39:21,980 --> 02:39:23,960
mentioned commissioned paperwork.

6114
02:39:24,200 --> 02:39:24,770
Um,

6115
02:39:24,770 --> 02:39:29,770
he apparently admitted that his manager
forge a signature and they asked him,

6116
02:39:30,951 --> 02:39:32,600
have you ever considered
getting a new manager?

6117
02:39:33,140 --> 02:39:34,070
And he joked around,

6118
02:39:34,071 --> 02:39:34,401
but yeah,

6119
02:39:34,401 --> 02:39:34,940
he has.

6120
02:39:34,940 --> 02:39:35,241
He said,

6121
02:39:35,241 --> 02:39:35,361
no,

6122
02:39:35,361 --> 02:39:36,194
I'm just kidding.

6123
02:39:36,530 --> 02:39:36,830
Um,

6124
02:39:36,830 --> 02:39:38,720
but that's not good.

6125
02:39:38,750 --> 02:39:43,750
And then there was a bunch of stuff
in like what he provided as a possible

6126
02:39:45,171 --> 02:39:47,000
source of that stuff.

6127
02:39:47,510 --> 02:39:47,841
You know,

6128
02:39:47,841 --> 02:39:48,674
like he didn't,

6129
02:39:48,980 --> 02:39:51,770
he didn't have in these a lot of the
things that he provided as a source of

6130
02:39:51,810 --> 02:39:54,260
stuff in his list of
stuff that he had taken.

6131
02:39:54,370 --> 02:39:54,800
Yeah.

6132
02:39:54,800 --> 02:39:55,633
You know,

6133
02:39:55,970 --> 02:39:57,170
there's a lot going on there,

6134
02:39:57,171 --> 02:39:57,471
man.

6135
02:39:57,471 --> 02:40:00,530
But the real problem is like John at one
point and Thomas being represented by

6136
02:40:00,531 --> 02:40:01,364
Nike.

6137
02:40:01,760 --> 02:40:03,440
I mean he was representing Nike.

6138
02:40:03,441 --> 02:40:03,801
He was,

6139
02:40:03,801 --> 02:40:05,510
he had a huge Nike contract.

6140
02:40:05,600 --> 02:40:06,340
Yeah.

6141
02:40:06,340 --> 02:40:06,771
And that's,

6142
02:40:06,771 --> 02:40:07,610
and that's huge.

6143
02:40:07,640 --> 02:40:10,580
I mean damn that was giant
cause that was pre Reebok too.

6144
02:40:11,090 --> 02:40:14,160
That was the pre pre Reebok days
where he would have got all the juice.

6145
02:40:14,310 --> 02:40:15,210
He would've got it all.

6146
02:40:15,630 --> 02:40:18,350
And you know what can the have,

6147
02:40:18,360 --> 02:40:22,590
should have a shit goes on forever
and on top of the top of that of um,

6148
02:40:23,280 --> 02:40:28,280
the Coulda woulda Shoulda of that
being pre Reebok and it being Nike with

6149
02:40:28,440 --> 02:40:30,330
everything that comes to the sport sends.

6150
02:40:30,331 --> 02:40:32,210
Then imagine if John like he could like,

6151
02:40:32,211 --> 02:40:33,044
he could have done it,

6152
02:40:33,240 --> 02:40:35,040
gone to Jordan route in some sense.

6153
02:40:35,041 --> 02:40:39,930
You know why he's got like a whole
line of John Jones Shawnae type shit.

6154
02:40:39,931 --> 02:40:40,351
That's nice.

6155
02:40:40,351 --> 02:40:40,681
Sure.

6156
02:40:40,681 --> 02:40:41,460
Nine,

6157
02:40:41,460 --> 02:40:41,970
you know,

6158
02:40:41,970 --> 02:40:43,380
it could be the heavyweight
champion right now.

6159
02:40:43,381 --> 02:40:44,100
Who knows?

6160
02:40:44,100 --> 02:40:44,933
I mean who knows.

6161
02:40:45,030 --> 02:40:46,200
We could absolutely.

6162
02:40:46,530 --> 02:40:47,191
Absolutely.

6163
02:40:47,191 --> 02:40:48,720
He could be in a super
fight with Steve Bay.

6164
02:40:48,750 --> 02:40:48,991
Yeah,

6165
02:40:48,991 --> 02:40:49,771
absolutely.

6166
02:40:49,771 --> 02:40:51,600
100% absolutely.

6167
02:40:52,170 --> 02:40:54,270
That'd be a huge fucking fight,

6168
02:40:54,271 --> 02:40:54,541
man.

6169
02:40:54,541 --> 02:40:55,374
Frank MMA,

6170
02:40:55,560 --> 02:40:57,270
John Coming up to heavyweight.

6171
02:40:57,960 --> 02:40:58,321
I mean,

6172
02:40:58,321 --> 02:41:00,750
it's a huge fight with DC
coming up to heavyweight.

6173
02:41:00,751 --> 02:41:01,170
Yes.

6174
02:41:01,170 --> 02:41:01,710
You know,

6175
02:41:01,710 --> 02:41:02,430
and the only guy,

6176
02:41:02,430 --> 02:41:05,730
the only guy to have a best in
his job and not just best to me,

6177
02:41:05,780 --> 02:41:06,330
k owed him.

6178
02:41:06,330 --> 02:41:06,810
Yeah.

6179
02:41:06,810 --> 02:41:07,201
You know,

6180
02:41:07,201 --> 02:41:08,940
I mean he hit him with
that left high kick.

6181
02:41:08,941 --> 02:41:10,650
That's that DC said,

6182
02:41:10,651 --> 02:41:11,970
you're not going to hit
me with that left kick.

6183
02:41:12,210 --> 02:41:12,630
Yeah.

6184
02:41:12,630 --> 02:41:16,020
Literally said that because he was
saying he exposes some tendencies like,

6185
02:41:16,080 --> 02:41:16,201
oh,

6186
02:41:16,201 --> 02:41:17,034
you mean the left care,

6187
02:41:17,040 --> 02:41:19,770
you're not going to hit me with
that left hot kick and then boom,

6188
02:41:19,771 --> 02:41:21,030
he lands a left high kick.

6189
02:41:21,270 --> 02:41:23,820
Is that like the titanic
a little bit like,

6190
02:41:24,090 --> 02:41:24,510
yeah.

6191
02:41:24,510 --> 02:41:26,070
It only saying because
they said it wouldn't.

6192
02:41:26,160 --> 02:41:26,581
Yeah,

6193
02:41:26,581 --> 02:41:27,414
maybe.

6194
02:41:27,510 --> 02:41:27,750
Well,

6195
02:41:27,750 --> 02:41:29,130
but that's kind of crazy.

6196
02:41:29,210 --> 02:41:30,043
Yeah.

6197
02:41:30,150 --> 02:41:31,890
We are a couple,

6198
02:41:31,891 --> 02:41:34,830
a couple of weeks ago I saw you at the
comedy store and you ask me about your

6199
02:41:34,831 --> 02:41:35,880
boy Brendan.

6200
02:41:36,180 --> 02:41:36,780
Yeah.

6201
02:41:36,780 --> 02:41:39,180
And like you,

6202
02:41:39,181 --> 02:41:40,410
you had asked me about you,

6203
02:41:40,420 --> 02:41:41,200
you were to explain,

6204
02:41:41,200 --> 02:41:43,660
explain the whole thing to
people that don't know the story.

6205
02:41:43,710 --> 02:41:48,710
Brendan said something where he
was talking about UFC tonight,

6206
02:41:50,150 --> 02:41:50,391
right.

6207
02:41:50,391 --> 02:41:50,491
It's,

6208
02:41:50,491 --> 02:41:51,300
you'll see tonight,

6209
02:41:51,300 --> 02:41:51,571
well,

6210
02:41:51,571 --> 02:41:56,520
he's talking about the pat of the Fox
Paddle Fox panel and he said something

6211
02:41:56,521 --> 02:41:57,030
about,

6212
02:41:57,030 --> 02:41:57,840
I get it,

6213
02:41:57,840 --> 02:41:58,411
Fox,

6214
02:41:58,411 --> 02:41:59,580
you're not racist.

6215
02:41:59,760 --> 02:42:03,030
Like saying that you have a
bunch of black people on it.

6216
02:42:03,180 --> 02:42:03,430
Yeah.

6217
02:42:03,430 --> 02:42:03,801
Fell off,

6218
02:42:03,801 --> 02:42:06,720
fell broadcasts and
because they're not racist,

6219
02:42:06,780 --> 02:42:07,350
um,

6220
02:42:07,350 --> 02:42:08,240
myself tiring.

6221
02:42:08,241 --> 02:42:08,471
And,

6222
02:42:08,471 --> 02:42:10,980
and Karen Bryant with the three
that were on the desk that day,

6223
02:42:11,280 --> 02:42:14,580
but also a lot of times
we're shod a lot of times DC.

6224
02:42:15,290 --> 02:42:16,123
Um,

6225
02:42:16,320 --> 02:42:18,210
and so it was like,

6226
02:42:18,760 --> 02:42:20,750
I bet are you checking
off boxes because the,

6227
02:42:20,751 --> 02:42:23,100
are these the best brains in
the best speakers for this,

6228
02:42:23,101 --> 02:42:23,934
for the job.

6229
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:24,833
And it was like,

6230
02:42:25,080 --> 02:42:26,250
and you know,

6231
02:42:26,560 --> 02:42:26,890
I,

6232
02:42:26,890 --> 02:42:31,170
some people see the point that he was
trying to make the point that he claims

6233
02:42:31,171 --> 02:42:32,040
that he was trying to make.

6234
02:42:32,340 --> 02:42:33,030
Um,

6235
02:42:33,030 --> 02:42:33,811
but the thing is,

6236
02:42:33,811 --> 02:42:34,201
when you,

6237
02:42:34,201 --> 02:42:35,100
when you start,

6238
02:42:35,400 --> 02:42:37,140
when you start in on this race thing,

6239
02:42:37,350 --> 02:42:40,650
you're saying effectively that these,

6240
02:42:40,770 --> 02:42:45,660
there's a person or a group of these
people are only there because of the color

6241
02:42:45,661 --> 02:42:46,494
of their skin.

6242
02:42:46,620 --> 02:42:47,160
Right.

6243
02:42:47,160 --> 02:42:47,700
Um,

6244
02:42:47,700 --> 02:42:48,031
you could,

6245
02:42:48,031 --> 02:42:49,860
you could say all of that without,

6246
02:42:50,070 --> 02:42:51,120
without the whole,

6247
02:42:51,121 --> 02:42:51,541
I get it.

6248
02:42:51,541 --> 02:42:52,351
You're not racist,

6249
02:42:52,351 --> 02:42:54,450
you're are you checking
off boxes or whatever.

6250
02:42:54,750 --> 02:42:55,110
Right.

6251
02:42:55,110 --> 02:42:57,990
Because if that doesn't
matter to the question,

6252
02:42:57,991 --> 02:42:59,580
that was the point that
you're trying to make them.

6253
02:42:59,581 --> 02:43:00,350
Why bring it up,

6254
02:43:00,350 --> 02:43:00,770
Brian?

6255
02:43:00,770 --> 02:43:01,230
You know,

6256
02:43:01,230 --> 02:43:01,890
that's,

6257
02:43:01,890 --> 02:43:04,440
I feel like I know Brendan very well.

6258
02:43:04,470 --> 02:43:05,190
I love him.

6259
02:43:05,190 --> 02:43:06,390
He's one of my best friends.

6260
02:43:06,450 --> 02:43:07,740
He's definitely not a racist,

6261
02:43:07,741 --> 02:43:09,180
but he definitely talks too much.

6262
02:43:09,240 --> 02:43:09,660
Yeah.

6263
02:43:09,660 --> 02:43:11,410
And I don't mean that in a bad way.

6264
02:43:11,411 --> 02:43:11,980
Like he talks

6265
02:43:11,980 --> 02:43:12,371
too much.

6266
02:43:12,371 --> 02:43:12,641
I mean,

6267
02:43:12,641 --> 02:43:16,450
like he says his too many podcasts and
too many things and you say things and

6268
02:43:16,451 --> 02:43:16,781
I'm,

6269
02:43:16,781 --> 02:43:18,460
I'm 100% guilty of this.

6270
02:43:18,880 --> 02:43:20,410
He say things and you're like,

6271
02:43:20,411 --> 02:43:21,340
why don't even say that?

6272
02:43:21,550 --> 02:43:23,910
And then all of a sudden you're
defending it and then you're,

6273
02:43:23,940 --> 02:43:24,773
you're caught up in,

6274
02:43:25,440 --> 02:43:25,750
you know,

6275
02:43:25,750 --> 02:43:30,750
just like a wave of just trying to sort
out what you're saying without someone

6276
02:43:31,961 --> 02:43:33,010
being there to say,

6277
02:43:33,011 --> 02:43:33,844
well,

6278
02:43:34,060 --> 02:43:34,870
look,

6279
02:43:34,870 --> 02:43:35,760
here's thing.

6280
02:43:35,800 --> 02:43:38,530
Tyron Woodley UFC
welterweight world champion,

6281
02:43:38,730 --> 02:43:38,950
uh,

6282
02:43:38,950 --> 02:43:39,790
Eve Edwards,

6283
02:43:40,300 --> 02:43:43,660
arguably the best one 55 are in
the world at one point in time.

6284
02:43:44,050 --> 02:43:45,400
Massive veteran in sport.

6285
02:43:45,760 --> 02:43:46,001
Um,

6286
02:43:46,001 --> 02:43:46,781
you can go down the list.

6287
02:43:46,781 --> 02:43:47,471
Rashad Evans,

6288
02:43:47,471 --> 02:43:48,670
former light heavyweight champion.

6289
02:43:48,970 --> 02:43:49,181
I mean,

6290
02:43:49,181 --> 02:43:52,120
you're talking about top flight champions,

6291
02:43:52,180 --> 02:43:53,470
former champions,

6292
02:43:53,680 --> 02:43:55,630
elite mixed martial artists,

6293
02:43:55,660 --> 02:43:57,610
but you also have Bisbing
y'all said Paul Felder,

6294
02:43:57,611 --> 02:43:58,930
you also have Kenny.

6295
02:43:58,960 --> 02:43:59,290
Yeah,

6296
02:43:59,290 --> 02:44:00,160
Kenny Florian.

6297
02:44:00,490 --> 02:44:00,821
You know,

6298
02:44:00,821 --> 02:44:01,960
you have just,

6299
02:44:01,961 --> 02:44:06,430
they're just elite top of the
food chain fighters and analysts.

6300
02:44:06,880 --> 02:44:09,400
I think it was a bad path to go down.

6301
02:44:09,430 --> 02:44:10,930
I don't think it made sense.

6302
02:44:11,620 --> 02:44:12,430
I just,

6303
02:44:12,430 --> 02:44:15,790
I think he thought it made sense
in his head when he was saying it.

6304
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:18,310
I think maybe he was
trying to be controversial.

6305
02:44:19,300 --> 02:44:20,140
Maybe just,

6306
02:44:20,710 --> 02:44:21,340
I don't know.

6307
02:44:21,340 --> 02:44:21,760
You know,

6308
02:44:21,760 --> 02:44:22,750
it didn't make sense to me.

6309
02:44:22,820 --> 02:44:23,091
Yeah.

6310
02:44:23,091 --> 02:44:24,350
It didn't make sense to me though.

6311
02:44:24,351 --> 02:44:25,041
But like my,

6312
02:44:25,041 --> 02:44:27,650
my thing about it wasn't okay,

6313
02:44:27,651 --> 02:44:28,820
you're being racist.

6314
02:44:28,910 --> 02:44:29,330
Right?

6315
02:44:29,330 --> 02:44:29,870
Um,

6316
02:44:29,870 --> 02:44:30,231
like it's,

6317
02:44:30,231 --> 02:44:32,000
it's a thing when you bring race into the,

6318
02:44:32,210 --> 02:44:33,230
to the situation too.

6319
02:44:33,500 --> 02:44:33,861
Right.

6320
02:44:33,861 --> 02:44:35,000
But my thing wasn't,

6321
02:44:35,240 --> 02:44:36,860
you're racist because you say this.

6322
02:44:37,010 --> 02:44:41,930
My thing was you're saying that I'm
in this position because I'm not good

6323
02:44:41,931 --> 02:44:42,440
enough.

6324
02:44:42,440 --> 02:44:42,740
Right.

6325
02:44:42,740 --> 02:44:46,430
You're saying that I'm only here because
of affirmative action or whatever you

6326
02:44:46,431 --> 02:44:47,264
want to call it,

6327
02:44:47,390 --> 02:44:47,930
you know,

6328
02:44:47,930 --> 02:44:48,250
um,

6329
02:44:48,250 --> 02:44:51,110
there's not a quality to my
work and that's where I'm like,

6330
02:44:51,111 --> 02:44:51,710
yeah,

6331
02:44:51,710 --> 02:44:52,281
fuck that.

6332
02:44:52,281 --> 02:44:52,461
That's,

6333
02:44:52,461 --> 02:44:53,151
that's not the case.

6334
02:44:53,151 --> 02:44:53,570
I know.

6335
02:44:53,570 --> 02:44:54,500
I know that I'm good at,

6336
02:44:54,560 --> 02:44:56,220
I know that I'm good at the sport,

6337
02:44:56,250 --> 02:44:59,510
I understand the sport and I'm
good at explaining what I see.

6338
02:44:59,750 --> 02:44:59,990
Brian,

6339
02:44:59,990 --> 02:45:00,750
who would,

6340
02:45:00,750 --> 02:45:01,081
you know,

6341
02:45:01,081 --> 02:45:03,480
the other thing is like
who would replace them?

6342
02:45:04,160 --> 02:45:04,993
Are we,

6343
02:45:05,130 --> 02:45:06,690
is there a white people
that are missing out?

6344
02:45:07,340 --> 02:45:07,551
Yeah.

6345
02:45:07,551 --> 02:45:08,290
On the GIG.

6346
02:45:08,290 --> 02:45:08,630
Yeah.

6347
02:45:08,630 --> 02:45:09,560
Like who's,

6348
02:45:09,660 --> 02:45:11,690
who's went to an audition?

6349
02:45:11,870 --> 02:45:12,111
Yeah.

6350
02:45:12,111 --> 02:45:14,810
Who's not getting the job though
as they're like someone who's like,

6351
02:45:14,811 --> 02:45:15,051
wow,

6352
02:45:15,051 --> 02:45:16,340
this guy really speaks really well,

6353
02:45:16,341 --> 02:45:17,690
but they're holding them
down because he's white.

6354
02:45:18,540 --> 02:45:19,610
Has that even happened?

6355
02:45:20,060 --> 02:45:20,421
Yeah.

6356
02:45:20,421 --> 02:45:22,100
Some people they would probably
be like that to happen,

6357
02:45:22,101 --> 02:45:23,480
but I don't think that's
actually happened.

6358
02:45:23,510 --> 02:45:23,890
Yeah.

6359
02:45:23,890 --> 02:45:24,270
I,

6360
02:45:24,270 --> 02:45:25,580
I agree completely,

6361
02:45:25,880 --> 02:45:26,360
but,

6362
02:45:26,360 --> 02:45:27,200
so we kind of,

6363
02:45:27,320 --> 02:45:28,370
we kind of went through that.

6364
02:45:28,371 --> 02:45:28,761
You know,

6365
02:45:28,761 --> 02:45:29,031
I,

6366
02:45:29,031 --> 02:45:29,570
um,

6367
02:45:29,570 --> 02:45:30,590
he sent me a message,

6368
02:45:30,591 --> 02:45:32,630
he apologized about that and I was like,

6369
02:45:32,631 --> 02:45:33,140
cool.

6370
02:45:33,140 --> 02:45:36,200
Like my thing was not
about the race thing.

6371
02:45:36,201 --> 02:45:37,100
My thing was,

6372
02:45:37,490 --> 02:45:42,490
you said these things and you either
saying somebody or a group of people up

6373
02:45:42,981 --> 02:45:44,480
there aren't qualified for the job.

6374
02:45:44,510 --> 02:45:47,690
You're insinuating that a group
of people that you belong to.

6375
02:45:47,750 --> 02:45:47,931
Right.

6376
02:45:47,931 --> 02:45:48,980
We're not qualified to do to the jail.

6377
02:45:49,210 --> 02:45:49,690
So that,

6378
02:45:49,690 --> 02:45:50,060
that,

6379
02:45:50,060 --> 02:45:51,740
that's where I was coming from with it.

6380
02:45:51,800 --> 02:45:52,130
Yeah.

6381
02:45:52,130 --> 02:45:54,350
And then I thought it was squash,

6382
02:45:54,560 --> 02:45:56,960
but then he said some
other stuff after that.

6383
02:45:57,050 --> 02:45:57,950
And that's why I'm like,

6384
02:45:57,951 --> 02:45:58,131
man,

6385
02:45:58,131 --> 02:45:59,030
what did he say afterwards?

6386
02:45:59,080 --> 02:45:59,810
Um,

6387
02:45:59,810 --> 02:46:00,081
he was,

6388
02:46:00,081 --> 02:46:00,500
I think,

6389
02:46:00,500 --> 02:46:01,400
I forget the guy's name.

6390
02:46:01,430 --> 02:46:01,790
Luke.

6391
02:46:01,790 --> 02:46:02,150
Luke,

6392
02:46:02,150 --> 02:46:02,540
sorry.

6393
02:46:02,540 --> 02:46:03,560
I remember Luke Thomas,

6394
02:46:03,590 --> 02:46:03,850
right?

6395
02:46:03,850 --> 02:46:04,401
He was on this guy,

6396
02:46:04,401 --> 02:46:08,410
Luke Thomas show and easy saying stuff
east civically talking about me now.

6397
02:46:08,411 --> 02:46:08,661
It's like,

6398
02:46:08,661 --> 02:46:08,781
yeah,

6399
02:46:08,781 --> 02:46:09,411
I to them,

6400
02:46:09,411 --> 02:46:11,750
we're all friends I talked
to eat and he's like,

6401
02:46:11,900 --> 02:46:12,111
well,

6402
02:46:12,111 --> 02:46:13,100
see eaves,

6403
02:46:13,190 --> 02:46:15,380
there's something eve season himself.

6404
02:46:15,560 --> 02:46:16,393
And I'm just like,

6405
02:46:16,610 --> 02:46:16,941
man,

6406
02:46:16,941 --> 02:46:17,421
you're not,

6407
02:46:17,421 --> 02:46:18,254
you're not.

6408
02:46:18,410 --> 02:46:19,243
Yeah,

6409
02:46:19,590 --> 02:46:20,400
Nike's Isa.

6410
02:46:20,400 --> 02:46:22,240
I feel like that's something
you've seasoned himself.

6411
02:46:22,390 --> 02:46:23,470
He was aggressive and this,

6412
02:46:23,471 --> 02:46:23,681
that,

6413
02:46:23,681 --> 02:46:23,951
you know,

6414
02:46:23,951 --> 02:46:24,341
he said,

6415
02:46:24,341 --> 02:46:25,091
he said he was,

6416
02:46:25,091 --> 02:46:25,510
um,

6417
02:46:25,510 --> 02:46:26,860
he was emotional and this and that.

6418
02:46:26,861 --> 02:46:27,281
And I'm like,

6419
02:46:27,281 --> 02:46:27,881
like there's an,

6420
02:46:27,881 --> 02:46:28,631
I never said to you,

6421
02:46:28,631 --> 02:46:29,500
I was emotional.

6422
02:46:29,830 --> 02:46:30,663
Um,

6423
02:46:30,700 --> 02:46:31,930
none of these things.

6424
02:46:31,931 --> 02:46:33,310
So like you're like,

6425
02:46:33,311 --> 02:46:34,031
this bus is coming,

6426
02:46:34,031 --> 02:46:35,980
you're waiting to throw me in
front of it or some shit like that.

6427
02:46:35,981 --> 02:46:36,401
And I'm like,

6428
02:46:36,401 --> 02:46:36,641
yeah,

6429
02:46:36,641 --> 02:46:37,930
no that's not cool man.

6430
02:46:38,200 --> 02:46:39,160
Like we're not friends.

6431
02:46:39,161 --> 02:46:39,791
We know each other.

6432
02:46:39,791 --> 02:46:42,430
They extent of our
friendship is like a UFC.

6433
02:46:42,431 --> 02:46:46,570
Last summer I saw Brendan across the aisle
and some guy rolled up on him and his

6434
02:46:46,571 --> 02:46:49,180
talking to him for like 10 minutes
and I'm looking back and I could see

6435
02:46:49,181 --> 02:46:51,550
Brendan's like [inaudible]
die cause I'm like,

6436
02:46:51,551 --> 02:46:51,821
let me,

6437
02:46:51,821 --> 02:46:52,930
let me go try and help him out.

6438
02:46:52,931 --> 02:46:56,050
So I go over there and I started talking
to Brendan and then to do it just hangs

6439
02:46:56,051 --> 02:46:56,170
out.

6440
02:46:56,170 --> 02:46:57,370
I talked to Brandon for about five,

6441
02:46:57,371 --> 02:47:00,130
10 minutes and then the dude just
hanging out behind us and I'm just like,

6442
02:47:00,580 --> 02:47:01,391
that's all I got man.

6443
02:47:01,391 --> 02:47:02,380
I'm going back to my seat.

6444
02:47:03,440 --> 02:47:04,120
When the guy jumped in,

6445
02:47:04,120 --> 02:47:05,260
the guy jumps right back in.

6446
02:47:05,320 --> 02:47:06,460
That's the extent of it.

6447
02:47:06,461 --> 02:47:08,290
I've seen him at different
places beyond that.

6448
02:47:08,291 --> 02:47:08,501
You know,

6449
02:47:08,501 --> 02:47:09,430
Brian and I are cool.

6450
02:47:09,431 --> 02:47:11,260
So I've seen him sometimes
when I seen Brian,

6451
02:47:11,560 --> 02:47:12,580
but like we're not boys.

6452
02:47:12,581 --> 02:47:13,810
We don't know each other like that.

6453
02:47:13,811 --> 02:47:13,991
So,

6454
02:47:13,991 --> 02:47:14,890
and like she,

6455
02:47:15,400 --> 02:47:16,690
and you're not a psychologist,

6456
02:47:16,691 --> 02:47:17,620
you're not a psychiatrist,

6457
02:47:17,621 --> 02:47:19,840
so you're not qualified to be
speaking on my mental state.

6458
02:47:20,130 --> 02:47:20,280
No.

6459
02:47:20,280 --> 02:47:21,060
That he said that.

6460
02:47:21,060 --> 02:47:23,130
I feel like now that I'm remembering it,

6461
02:47:23,131 --> 02:47:25,320
you might've brought that up at
the comedy store the other night.

6462
02:47:25,380 --> 02:47:26,460
It didn't make any sense.

6463
02:47:26,580 --> 02:47:27,340
It doesn't make any I,

6464
02:47:27,340 --> 02:47:30,330
I'm Brendan's friend and I can't defend
them on that cause it doesn't make any

6465
02:47:30,331 --> 02:47:30,810
sense.

6466
02:47:30,810 --> 02:47:31,643
It just didn't,

6467
02:47:33,060 --> 02:47:34,110
it doesn't make any sense.

6468
02:47:34,270 --> 02:47:34,590
Yeah.

6469
02:47:34,590 --> 02:47:35,910
But sometimes he says,

6470
02:47:35,911 --> 02:47:36,121
shit,

6471
02:47:36,121 --> 02:47:36,841
that doesn't make sense.

6472
02:47:36,841 --> 02:47:38,580
And maybe if you were
in the room with them,

6473
02:47:38,730 --> 02:47:39,750
he wouldn't have said it.

6474
02:47:39,870 --> 02:47:41,670
Or maybe he would have said it better.

6475
02:47:41,790 --> 02:47:42,840
Or maybe he would have,

6476
02:47:43,030 --> 02:47:43,310
you know,

6477
02:47:43,310 --> 02:47:43,561
set.

6478
02:47:43,561 --> 02:47:44,880
Are these really the best minds?

6479
02:47:45,060 --> 02:47:46,110
But here's the argument.

6480
02:47:46,290 --> 02:47:46,981
If they're not,

6481
02:47:46,981 --> 02:47:48,750
who are like,

6482
02:47:48,751 --> 02:47:49,201
you really,

6483
02:47:49,201 --> 02:47:49,771
if you say,

6484
02:47:49,771 --> 02:47:51,060
are these really the best minds,

6485
02:47:51,061 --> 02:47:52,980
you really should provide
better alternatives.

6486
02:47:53,070 --> 02:47:54,630
So who are the better alternatives?

6487
02:47:55,180 --> 02:47:56,520
Who is a better alternative?

6488
02:47:56,521 --> 02:47:57,090
I mean there's,

6489
02:47:57,090 --> 02:47:58,650
there's a bunch of
really good guys online.

6490
02:47:58,650 --> 02:48:00,270
Brendan Dorman does
some really good stuff.

6491
02:48:00,271 --> 02:48:02,640
Lawrence Kenshin does some really
good stuff about analyzing stuff.

6492
02:48:02,641 --> 02:48:04,080
I don't know how good they are on camera.

6493
02:48:04,320 --> 02:48:05,580
There's a bunch of people like,

6494
02:48:05,581 --> 02:48:06,414
um,

6495
02:48:07,020 --> 02:48:10,620
you know that the do good Robin black
does some real good breakdowns and stuff

6496
02:48:10,621 --> 02:48:11,041
like that.

6497
02:48:11,041 --> 02:48:13,770
I mean maybe there's an argument
that he would do a great job,

6498
02:48:13,771 --> 02:48:14,940
but something like that for sure.

6499
02:48:15,240 --> 02:48:17,340
But you got to provide,

6500
02:48:17,470 --> 02:48:22,470
if it's not like there's like
some overwhelming absence
of the best guys where

6501
02:48:23,761 --> 02:48:24,331
they're saying,

6502
02:48:24,331 --> 02:48:24,900
hey,

6503
02:48:24,900 --> 02:48:28,860
why are you going with these black guys
instead of going with the best guys?

6504
02:48:29,040 --> 02:48:30,510
Why don't you have blah blah blah,

6505
02:48:30,540 --> 02:48:31,201
there's no blah blah,

6506
02:48:31,201 --> 02:48:31,620
blah.

6507
02:48:31,620 --> 02:48:32,730
Like there's no guy out there.

6508
02:48:32,731 --> 02:48:33,330
Yeah.

6509
02:48:33,330 --> 02:48:33,811
You know what I'm saying?

6510
02:48:33,811 --> 02:48:35,010
Like who would that guy be?

6511
02:48:35,480 --> 02:48:35,700
Okay.

6512
02:48:35,700 --> 02:48:36,540
I have no idea.

6513
02:48:36,541 --> 02:48:37,680
But there's also a formula.

6514
02:48:37,710 --> 02:48:42,710
I mean like you and Jimmy Smith kind of
other exception to the formula and the

6515
02:48:43,291 --> 02:48:44,400
formula is to have,

6516
02:48:44,610 --> 02:48:44,941
you know,

6517
02:48:44,941 --> 02:48:45,221
the,

6518
02:48:45,221 --> 02:48:47,810
the color guy in the play by
play guy in the play by play guy.

6519
02:48:47,811 --> 02:48:49,890
He's usually the one with
the actual experience.

6520
02:48:49,910 --> 02:48:50,130
Right?

6521
02:48:50,130 --> 02:48:51,510
You've been doing it so long,

6522
02:48:51,630 --> 02:48:53,510
you're as close to having the experiences.

6523
02:48:53,520 --> 02:48:54,370
Anybody can write

6524
02:48:54,430 --> 02:48:55,330
without having it.

6525
02:48:55,670 --> 02:48:59,380
Mel and Jimmy's right there next to you
in that was more experienced than me

6526
02:48:59,381 --> 02:49:00,250
cause he's fought MMA,

6527
02:49:00,280 --> 02:49:00,510
right?

6528
02:49:00,510 --> 02:49:00,781
Yeah.

6529
02:49:00,781 --> 02:49:01,591
He had some,

6530
02:49:01,591 --> 02:49:02,910
he's had a couple of fights.

6531
02:49:02,930 --> 02:49:03,140
Yeah,

6532
02:49:03,140 --> 02:49:03,330
right.

6533
02:49:03,330 --> 02:49:07,590
Not at that level but he understands
Robin black has had like two or three

6534
02:49:07,591 --> 02:49:08,424
fights also,

6535
02:49:08,820 --> 02:49:09,420
you know.

6536
02:49:09,420 --> 02:49:10,140
Um,

6537
02:49:10,140 --> 02:49:12,390
so that's the formula though.

6538
02:49:12,450 --> 02:49:13,283
You know I'm,

6539
02:49:13,290 --> 02:49:14,940
Karen is on the other side of that.

6540
02:49:14,941 --> 02:49:18,420
Karen just her role is
similar to Goldie's.

6541
02:49:18,421 --> 02:49:19,254
You know,

6542
02:49:19,650 --> 02:49:24,650
she is the person that that
asks the questions that has
an idea but doesn't have

6543
02:49:25,021 --> 02:49:27,600
the experience right
now and she represents,

6544
02:49:27,601 --> 02:49:29,580
she represents the fan for the most part.

6545
02:49:29,581 --> 02:49:31,650
She does it in a non robotic way.

6546
02:49:31,651 --> 02:49:31,951
Right.

6547
02:49:31,951 --> 02:49:34,680
Very important to like
for the person watching.

6548
02:49:34,860 --> 02:49:39,300
If you've got some guy who's like a
radio DJ coming out to those people,

6549
02:49:39,301 --> 02:49:43,080
they know how to say the right words
and they can do it and seem professional

6550
02:49:43,380 --> 02:49:44,213
but you don't,

6551
02:49:44,220 --> 02:49:45,420
it's your not smooth.

6552
02:49:45,421 --> 02:49:50,220
Whereas Karen knows how to be fun and
she can be loose and she's non robotic

6553
02:49:50,280 --> 02:49:52,230
while she be knowledge professional.

6554
02:49:52,580 --> 02:49:54,240
She has a knowledge of the sport.

6555
02:49:54,241 --> 02:49:55,970
To some degree and a cushion for it.

6556
02:49:56,200 --> 02:49:56,731
Exactly.

6557
02:49:56,731 --> 02:49:59,850
The Passion is what makes it
makes it even more out of her.

6558
02:49:59,851 --> 02:50:00,240
You know?

6559
02:50:00,240 --> 02:50:02,700
I was watching NFL the other
day and I was watching.

6560
02:50:02,701 --> 02:50:02,941
It was,

6561
02:50:02,941 --> 02:50:03,241
it was with,

6562
02:50:03,241 --> 02:50:05,160
you were whatever it was where I was like,

6563
02:50:05,161 --> 02:50:09,030
does that girl really the best person
to be interviewing these fucking giants?

6564
02:50:09,270 --> 02:50:10,080
Wasn't you?

6565
02:50:10,080 --> 02:50:10,530
I was like,

6566
02:50:10,530 --> 02:50:11,363
is that girl?

6567
02:50:11,830 --> 02:50:12,600
But she's hot.

6568
02:50:12,600 --> 02:50:13,680
She's hot as fuck.

6569
02:50:13,681 --> 02:50:13,951
I was like,

6570
02:50:13,951 --> 02:50:15,930
does she really know about football?

6571
02:50:15,931 --> 02:50:18,780
Or she is just a gig because
she wants to be famous.

6572
02:50:18,781 --> 02:50:19,201
You know what I mean?

6573
02:50:19,201 --> 02:50:20,070
Like there's a lot of those.

6574
02:50:20,280 --> 02:50:21,180
Whereas you would say,

6575
02:50:21,181 --> 02:50:21,960
okay,

6576
02:50:21,960 --> 02:50:24,540
there's gotta be someone
out there that's better,

6577
02:50:24,720 --> 02:50:27,060
who really understands the game,

6578
02:50:27,150 --> 02:50:31,020
who could get in there and ask
questions to this dude and find out why,

6579
02:50:31,050 --> 02:50:32,520
why they chose that play,

6580
02:50:32,640 --> 02:50:33,810
what went wrong?

6581
02:50:33,900 --> 02:50:35,160
What was he thinking when this happened?

6582
02:50:35,161 --> 02:50:37,440
Like someone who really is a fan of it.

6583
02:50:37,770 --> 02:50:39,360
That's what I want to see with fighting,

6584
02:50:39,840 --> 02:50:40,261
you know?

6585
02:50:40,261 --> 02:50:40,740
I mean,

6586
02:50:40,740 --> 02:50:41,610
that to me,

6587
02:50:41,611 --> 02:50:44,160
fighting is so much more personal,

6588
02:50:44,161 --> 02:50:45,510
so much more intense.

6589
02:50:45,930 --> 02:50:50,520
When I see someone that's
interviewing someone,

6590
02:50:50,820 --> 02:50:53,670
I want to see someone who really fucking
cares because I know there's a lot of

6591
02:50:53,671 --> 02:50:55,350
people who do care and I care.

6592
02:50:55,650 --> 02:50:57,300
Like if I'm interviewing
someone after a fight,

6593
02:50:57,720 --> 02:51:02,040
I'm trying my best to figure out like
what was happening in their head.

6594
02:51:02,041 --> 02:51:05,250
There's some critical moments
I want to know was this there?

6595
02:51:05,251 --> 02:51:06,270
Was this a plan?

6596
02:51:06,330 --> 02:51:07,800
Did you see this in advance?

6597
02:51:07,801 --> 02:51:10,050
Does something you saw in training
when you're watching tapes?

6598
02:51:10,210 --> 02:51:13,020
I've questioned it's like fan questions.

6599
02:51:13,140 --> 02:51:15,420
So I do my best to relay those.

6600
02:51:15,480 --> 02:51:16,500
That's what I do my best.

6601
02:51:16,650 --> 02:51:21,650
If I feel like someone phoning it in or
this isn't a job they're interested in

6602
02:51:21,871 --> 02:51:22,980
or they really just want to be.

6603
02:51:22,980 --> 02:51:23,900
And you know,

6604
02:51:23,910 --> 02:51:24,743
some other sport,

6605
02:51:24,750 --> 02:51:27,000
they really wanted to be a
fucking baseball commentator,

6606
02:51:27,001 --> 02:51:27,834
but there was no gig.

6607
02:51:28,000 --> 02:51:28,400
Yeah,

6608
02:51:28,400 --> 02:51:29,940
they're just fucking half ass in it,

6609
02:51:30,120 --> 02:51:30,540
you know?

6610
02:51:30,540 --> 02:51:31,020
It's just,

6611
02:51:31,020 --> 02:51:31,350
it's,

6612
02:51:31,350 --> 02:51:32,140
it's weak,

6613
02:51:32,140 --> 02:51:32,840
it's terrible.

6614
02:51:32,840 --> 02:51:33,980
I one thing I love,

6615
02:51:33,981 --> 02:51:35,370
the one thing I always tried to do,

6616
02:51:35,550 --> 02:51:36,640
I always wanted to make,

6617
02:51:36,730 --> 02:51:39,150
I tried to make you
laugh every post fight,

6618
02:51:39,151 --> 02:51:39,460
interview,

6619
02:51:39,460 --> 02:51:40,290
any time.

6620
02:51:40,290 --> 02:51:41,820
Like it was like I won.

6621
02:51:41,870 --> 02:51:42,510
Have knock out.

6622
02:51:42,510 --> 02:51:43,080
Okay,

6623
02:51:43,080 --> 02:51:43,920
I'm going to talk to Jill.

6624
02:51:43,970 --> 02:51:44,251
Let's,

6625
02:51:44,251 --> 02:51:45,090
let's see what he gives me.

6626
02:51:45,091 --> 02:51:45,901
See if he gives me something,

6627
02:51:45,901 --> 02:51:46,734
I could try to make it.

6628
02:51:48,000 --> 02:51:49,620
Sometimes I came with something set up,

6629
02:51:49,860 --> 02:51:50,251
but um,

6630
02:51:50,251 --> 02:51:51,660
there's one time I forget who it was.

6631
02:51:51,661 --> 02:51:53,750
I think it was a Jeremy Stephens and um,

6632
02:51:53,980 --> 02:51:57,090
you had asked me to take you through the
replay and I was literally watching it

6633
02:51:57,390 --> 02:51:58,340
and um,

6634
02:51:58,620 --> 02:52:01,260
you had asked me question and I
wasn't even paying attention to you,

6635
02:52:01,530 --> 02:52:03,030
but so it worked out perfectly.

6636
02:52:03,470 --> 02:52:04,310
You would like to,

6637
02:52:04,410 --> 02:52:05,200
I was like jobs.

6638
02:52:05,200 --> 02:52:06,070
I was watching that

6639
02:52:06,460 --> 02:52:08,710
and I was going to ask you to ask
the question again and it hit me.

6640
02:52:08,711 --> 02:52:09,544
I was like,

6641
02:52:09,700 --> 02:52:10,780
and I was just thinking,

6642
02:52:10,810 --> 02:52:11,141
damn,

6643
02:52:11,141 --> 02:52:11,974
I'm smooth

6644
02:52:14,570 --> 02:52:16,240
and I got that reaction out of you.

6645
02:52:16,270 --> 02:52:17,103
So that was fun.

6646
02:52:17,120 --> 02:52:18,630
That would be the actual reaction.

6647
02:52:18,680 --> 02:52:23,050
He said that I also like
helping the Gar celebrate,

6648
02:52:23,080 --> 02:52:23,331
you know,

6649
02:52:23,331 --> 02:52:27,550
like there's moments like when someone
does something where someone almost has

6650
02:52:27,551 --> 02:52:29,950
to tell you like how amazing that was.

6651
02:52:29,980 --> 02:52:30,131
Like,

6652
02:52:30,131 --> 02:52:30,491
you know,

6653
02:52:30,491 --> 02:52:31,121
it was amazing,

6654
02:52:31,121 --> 02:52:31,610
but I want to,

6655
02:52:31,610 --> 02:52:33,160
I wanted to let you feel it even more.

6656
02:52:33,161 --> 02:52:33,994
I want you to,

6657
02:52:34,030 --> 02:52:34,301
you know,

6658
02:52:34,301 --> 02:52:34,840
like,

6659
02:52:34,840 --> 02:52:35,680
like when rose,

6660
02:52:35,681 --> 02:52:37,180
Nama Eunice beat you,

6661
02:52:37,181 --> 02:52:42,010
Ana like dad to me it's like one of my
favorite all time post fight interviews

6662
02:52:42,310 --> 02:52:42,821
cause she's like,

6663
02:52:42,821 --> 02:52:43,990
y'all just be a good person.

6664
02:52:44,180 --> 02:52:45,250
It's about don't mean shit.

6665
02:52:48,010 --> 02:52:49,780
Damn rose is out there.

6666
02:52:50,050 --> 02:52:50,501
You know,

6667
02:52:50,501 --> 02:52:51,760
she's so unusual.

6668
02:52:51,970 --> 02:52:56,970
And to have her walk through it like this
impossible underdog coming in and even

6669
02:52:57,341 --> 02:52:57,911
if she wanted,

6670
02:52:57,911 --> 02:52:59,350
but he thought she went by submission.

6671
02:52:59,630 --> 02:53:02,260
I didn't think she'd just stepped in
and cracker with a left hook and then

6672
02:53:02,270 --> 02:53:03,100
dropper.

6673
02:53:03,100 --> 02:53:03,933
Like what?

6674
02:53:04,240 --> 02:53:05,170
That was crazy.

6675
02:53:05,230 --> 02:53:07,180
Like watching that fight was crazy.

6676
02:53:08,920 --> 02:53:10,260
Here's a good one for you on it.

6677
02:53:10,261 --> 02:53:11,500
On an another big fight.

6678
02:53:11,501 --> 02:53:14,020
I feel like there is a
moment right in a fight,

6679
02:53:14,021 --> 02:53:18,250
especially when you get a finish sometimes
is a moment that comes just before

6680
02:53:18,251 --> 02:53:21,460
the finish that you recognize this
opportunities there and you jump on it.

6681
02:53:21,880 --> 02:53:22,510
Um,

6682
02:53:22,510 --> 02:53:25,300
and then there are times when
like before the moment happens,

6683
02:53:25,301 --> 02:53:28,420
it's like before the shot comes just
like this guy's about to fill this right

6684
02:53:28,421 --> 02:53:31,510
hand and I know I'm going to slip it
and drop and drop my right on top of it.

6685
02:53:31,810 --> 02:53:32,160
Right.

6686
02:53:32,160 --> 02:53:32,590
Um,

6687
02:53:32,590 --> 02:53:34,360
but then there are times when
you hit a guy and it's like,

6688
02:53:34,450 --> 02:53:35,860
oh this is my chance.

6689
02:53:36,040 --> 02:53:36,290
Right.

6690
02:53:36,290 --> 02:53:38,350
Jump on him and you know,

6691
02:53:38,351 --> 02:53:42,850
the end is near and all that
rush when the referee steps that,

6692
02:53:42,851 --> 02:53:43,870
that's the moment.

6693
02:53:43,871 --> 02:53:47,140
That's the biggest moment when
the referee stops the fight,

6694
02:53:47,320 --> 02:53:48,153
that's when you come.

6695
02:53:48,580 --> 02:53:49,413
You know what I mean?

6696
02:53:49,510 --> 02:53:54,510
So like if you can figure out how to
ask that question because getting good,

6697
02:53:57,160 --> 02:53:59,980
getting someone to explain that moment is,

6698
02:54:00,070 --> 02:54:02,770
is if they can translate that.

6699
02:54:02,771 --> 02:54:03,551
That's so sweet.

6700
02:54:03,551 --> 02:54:05,920
Cause like I like I can
think of what my lab,

6701
02:54:05,980 --> 02:54:09,790
one of my last vice when it was
Steven's like when I hit him I didn't,

6702
02:54:09,820 --> 02:54:13,120
I knew what I was doing and I knew
I was going to land the punch.

6703
02:54:13,700 --> 02:54:14,620
Then as he went down,

6704
02:54:14,621 --> 02:54:15,454
it was like,

6705
02:54:15,640 --> 02:54:16,420
Oh shit,

6706
02:54:16,420 --> 02:54:19,030
here's that moment when you jump on it,

6707
02:54:19,060 --> 02:54:19,893
you know,

6708
02:54:20,260 --> 02:54:21,400
being able to beat,

6709
02:54:21,460 --> 02:54:21,810
that's,

6710
02:54:21,810 --> 02:54:24,040
that's what the best
thing to get out of guys.

6711
02:54:24,040 --> 02:54:24,311
And you,

6712
02:54:24,311 --> 02:54:25,330
you asked that question.

6713
02:54:25,331 --> 02:54:25,870
Well,

6714
02:54:25,870 --> 02:54:27,910
but also if you,

6715
02:54:28,010 --> 02:54:28,390
if,

6716
02:54:28,390 --> 02:54:29,830
if they can see it coming,

6717
02:54:30,280 --> 02:54:30,581
man,

6718
02:54:30,581 --> 02:54:31,600
seeing that coming,

6719
02:54:32,560 --> 02:54:33,101
that's the thing.

6720
02:54:33,101 --> 02:54:33,934
That's when he's like,

6721
02:54:34,330 --> 02:54:36,100
this chick is hot and I
know I'm going to get it.

6722
02:54:38,080 --> 02:54:39,220
It's that moment when it's like,

6723
02:54:39,250 --> 02:54:39,491
oh,

6724
02:54:39,491 --> 02:54:40,630
this is actually happening.

6725
02:54:40,660 --> 02:54:42,130
What do you miss the most about fighting?

6726
02:54:43,750 --> 02:54:44,950
Like what don't I miss?

6727
02:54:45,370 --> 02:54:46,203
It's,

6728
02:54:46,810 --> 02:54:48,280
I love that challenge man.

6729
02:54:48,320 --> 02:54:50,760
Like that's why I still
like training and whatnot,

6730
02:54:50,770 --> 02:54:51,250
but,

6731
02:54:51,250 --> 02:54:52,930
but the actual fight itself,

6732
02:54:53,110 --> 02:54:54,880
it's because everything's on the line.

6733
02:54:55,030 --> 02:54:57,970
They already thought about doing grappling
competitions or anything where it's

6734
02:54:57,971 --> 02:54:58,870
no striking.

6735
02:55:00,010 --> 02:55:00,670
I,

6736
02:55:00,670 --> 02:55:01,930
I have not.

6737
02:55:02,250 --> 02:55:02,650
I've been,

6738
02:55:02,650 --> 02:55:04,040
I thought it once or twice,

6739
02:55:04,041 --> 02:55:05,810
but not been committed to doing it.

6740
02:55:06,070 --> 02:55:06,350
Um,

6741
02:55:06,350 --> 02:55:08,540
I'm starting to train more now again.

6742
02:55:08,900 --> 02:55:09,590
Um,

6743
02:55:09,590 --> 02:55:10,310
I had some,

6744
02:55:10,310 --> 02:55:12,680
some things happening in life
that were changing for me.

6745
02:55:12,681 --> 02:55:15,410
I just moved out here
and I didn't have the,

6746
02:55:15,411 --> 02:55:16,244
um,

6747
02:55:16,850 --> 02:55:18,380
the team,

6748
02:55:18,410 --> 02:55:19,610
the foundation behind me.

6749
02:55:19,850 --> 02:55:20,681
I didn't have the,

6750
02:55:20,681 --> 02:55:22,640
the group that I was with
all the time anymore.

6751
02:55:22,641 --> 02:55:23,474
I had to find a,

6752
02:55:23,930 --> 02:55:24,561
find a new group,

6753
02:55:24,561 --> 02:55:27,560
started building new group and
now that we have this group,

6754
02:55:27,890 --> 02:55:28,400
um,

6755
02:55:28,400 --> 02:55:29,450
I feel more comfortable.

6756
02:55:29,451 --> 02:55:30,680
I'm back in the gym more,

6757
02:55:30,681 --> 02:55:35,681
I'm able to do more like that and
like I'm still in good shape and yeah,

6758
02:55:35,780 --> 02:55:38,210
I feel like maybe I want to compete again,

6759
02:55:38,390 --> 02:55:39,500
but just for the fun of it,

6760
02:55:39,530 --> 02:55:39,831
you know,

6761
02:55:39,831 --> 02:55:42,090
not for it not to try
and be a world champion.

6762
02:55:42,110 --> 02:55:43,750
Anything as uh,

6763
02:55:43,910 --> 02:55:46,400
in MMA or compete in Jujitsu.

6764
02:55:47,480 --> 02:55:48,860
I still love him and May,

6765
02:55:49,460 --> 02:55:50,570
it doesn't make sense.

6766
02:55:50,571 --> 02:55:51,404
So,

6767
02:55:51,500 --> 02:55:52,100
you know,

6768
02:55:52,100 --> 02:55:52,900
um,

6769
02:55:52,900 --> 02:55:57,220
there are definitely some fights that I
wish could have happened or that I would

6770
02:55:57,221 --> 02:55:57,710
have had.

6771
02:55:57,710 --> 02:55:58,171
Like what,

6772
02:55:58,171 --> 02:56:00,560
what far do you feel like
you missed out on fighting?

6773
02:56:00,561 --> 02:56:01,460
Call me at one point.

6774
02:56:02,030 --> 02:56:03,830
You know when go mia was gummy.

6775
02:56:03,860 --> 02:56:04,430
Yeah.

6776
02:56:04,430 --> 02:56:07,400
Like throw those fucking
fast pitch baseball punches,

6777
02:56:07,401 --> 02:56:07,790
man.

6778
02:56:07,790 --> 02:56:08,251
Like the,

6779
02:56:08,251 --> 02:56:08,490
the,

6780
02:56:08,490 --> 02:56:09,530
the pride tournament.

6781
02:56:09,980 --> 02:56:12,260
I would have loved to fight
everybody in that tournament.

6782
02:56:12,590 --> 02:56:13,010
And you know,

6783
02:56:13,010 --> 02:56:15,470
every individual I find
hats and that was fun.

6784
02:56:15,830 --> 02:56:16,700
He smelled like ass.

6785
02:56:16,701 --> 02:56:17,534
But that was fun.

6786
02:56:17,940 --> 02:56:18,590
It was horrible.

6787
02:56:18,590 --> 02:56:19,670
Do you think he did it on purpose?

6788
02:56:19,810 --> 02:56:20,390
One of those?

6789
02:56:20,390 --> 02:56:20,871
He does that.

6790
02:56:20,871 --> 02:56:22,610
Every fight just doesn't smell.

6791
02:56:22,920 --> 02:56:23,661
It doesn't wash her.

6792
02:56:23,661 --> 02:56:24,800
Some days is bad.

6793
02:56:25,070 --> 02:56:25,903
Um,

6794
02:56:26,120 --> 02:56:26,810
shoot.

6795
02:56:26,810 --> 02:56:27,080
Um,

6796
02:56:27,080 --> 02:56:27,561
soccer,

6797
02:56:27,561 --> 02:56:29,540
I like fights like that,

6798
02:56:29,541 --> 02:56:30,374
you know?

6799
02:56:30,380 --> 02:56:31,213
Um,

6800
02:56:31,700 --> 02:56:33,290
but like now there's,

6801
02:56:33,320 --> 02:56:34,490
there's still some guys,

6802
02:56:34,680 --> 02:56:35,513
uh,

6803
02:56:35,600 --> 02:56:37,010
I have a lot of respect for.

6804
02:56:37,011 --> 02:56:37,221
I,

6805
02:56:37,221 --> 02:56:38,810
I talked to Joel Lozan about it.

6806
02:56:38,811 --> 02:56:39,081
I was like,

6807
02:56:39,081 --> 02:56:39,261
man,

6808
02:56:39,261 --> 02:56:40,970
I'd love to fight a guy like Joe on,

6809
02:56:41,000 --> 02:56:41,833
you know.

6810
02:56:41,900 --> 02:56:42,470
Um,

6811
02:56:42,470 --> 02:56:46,970
but that was right after like
the first year of being retired.

6812
02:56:47,120 --> 02:56:48,440
How many years you've been retired now?

6813
02:56:48,470 --> 02:56:49,011
Five.

6814
02:56:49,011 --> 02:56:50,220
Three or f.

6815
02:56:50,360 --> 02:56:51,260
Since 2000.

6816
02:56:51,290 --> 02:56:52,123
There's almost four.

6817
02:56:52,130 --> 02:56:52,850
Almost four.

6818
02:56:52,850 --> 02:56:57,740
November before feel it seems like longer
for some strange reason because you

6819
02:56:57,741 --> 02:56:58,850
just missed me till I do.

6820
02:56:59,020 --> 02:56:59,580
You just miss it,

6821
02:56:59,580 --> 02:56:59,781
you know?

6822
02:56:59,781 --> 02:57:00,190
I do.

6823
02:57:00,190 --> 02:57:01,580
You just miss seeing that right leg,

6824
02:57:01,610 --> 02:57:02,443
left leg kick.

6825
02:57:02,800 --> 02:57:03,633
But um,

6826
02:57:03,650 --> 02:57:03,870
no,

6827
02:57:03,870 --> 02:57:04,703
it's,

6828
02:57:04,790 --> 02:57:06,980
it's one of those things where you,

6829
02:57:06,981 --> 02:57:07,820
you love it so much.

6830
02:57:07,821 --> 02:57:09,080
There are times when I'm watching fights,

6831
02:57:09,081 --> 02:57:09,500
man,

6832
02:57:09,500 --> 02:57:12,170
and there's some guys that are
like just outside the top 15.

6833
02:57:12,500 --> 02:57:14,180
I couldn't tell you any names right now,

6834
02:57:14,181 --> 02:57:15,014
but let me like,

6835
02:57:15,020 --> 02:57:15,291
like,

6836
02:57:15,291 --> 02:57:15,530
uh,

6837
02:57:15,530 --> 02:57:17,750
like Jake Matthews when he was a 55.

6838
02:57:18,500 --> 02:57:18,800
Like,

6839
02:57:18,800 --> 02:57:21,080
I feel like this kid is
good and he's awesome.

6840
02:57:21,370 --> 02:57:21,860
He's all set.

6841
02:57:21,860 --> 02:57:23,750
They're much bigger than
they were back in my day.

6842
02:57:23,751 --> 02:57:24,584
But it's still,

6843
02:57:24,620 --> 02:57:25,550
I'm like,

6844
02:57:25,760 --> 02:57:26,040
man,

6845
02:57:26,040 --> 02:57:27,680
sometimes I watch fights and I'm like,

6846
02:57:27,681 --> 02:57:28,071
man,

6847
02:57:28,071 --> 02:57:29,390
you mother fuckers is so lucky.

6848
02:57:29,391 --> 02:57:31,910
I'm not 25 just because of the fees,

6849
02:57:31,911 --> 02:57:32,370
you know,

6850
02:57:32,370 --> 02:57:33,730
now know.

6851
02:57:34,160 --> 02:57:35,270
But isn't that the thing?

6852
02:57:35,300 --> 02:57:35,630
Right.

6853
02:57:35,630 --> 02:57:39,920
The older fighters have way more
knowledge and understanding of what to do,

6854
02:57:39,921 --> 02:57:41,510
but their body doesn't
respond that way anymore.

6855
02:57:41,511 --> 02:57:44,960
And that's sort of the balance of it all
is that the young fighters have all the

6856
02:57:44,961 --> 02:57:49,190
piss and vinegar and fast twitch muscle
fibers and they don't know that much.

6857
02:57:49,340 --> 02:57:49,790
I,

6858
02:57:49,790 --> 02:57:50,601
for me,

6859
02:57:50,601 --> 02:57:51,171
I feel,

6860
02:57:51,171 --> 02:57:53,120
cause I still move around and
still sparse this morning.

6861
02:57:53,121 --> 02:57:54,840
We're like Joe and Mickey
and those guys and I,

6862
02:57:54,841 --> 02:57:55,311
I can,

6863
02:57:55,311 --> 02:57:58,550
I can do a lot of the things
that I've always been able to do.

6864
02:57:59,000 --> 02:57:59,780
Uh,

6865
02:57:59,780 --> 02:58:01,290
it has to do with,

6866
02:58:01,350 --> 02:58:02,220
for the most part,

6867
02:58:02,221 --> 02:58:02,700
for me,

6868
02:58:02,700 --> 02:58:03,570
the recovery.

6869
02:58:04,020 --> 02:58:05,310
Like the next day,

6870
02:58:05,640 --> 02:58:06,960
if I go hard today,

6871
02:58:07,260 --> 02:58:08,400
I can't go hard tomorrow.

6872
02:58:08,460 --> 02:58:08,851
I can't,

6873
02:58:08,851 --> 02:58:10,560
I can't go hard four days a week anymore.

6874
02:58:11,000 --> 02:58:11,220
You know,

6875
02:58:11,220 --> 02:58:14,790
I could go hide once or twice a
week and as I get in better shape,

6876
02:58:14,820 --> 02:58:17,160
like the twice will be more consistent.

6877
02:58:17,550 --> 02:58:18,000
But,

6878
02:58:18,000 --> 02:58:18,833
um,

6879
02:58:18,930 --> 02:58:23,930
the recovery I can still move very close
to just as fast as I've always been.

6880
02:58:24,570 --> 02:58:26,460
Like I think that will
go away at some point,

6881
02:58:26,461 --> 02:58:27,390
but I still have it.

6882
02:58:27,700 --> 02:58:28,140
Um,

6883
02:58:28,140 --> 02:58:29,760
and I can't take it like I used to.

6884
02:58:29,830 --> 02:58:30,250
Yeah.

6885
02:58:30,250 --> 02:58:31,860
You know that that's a difference.

6886
02:58:32,170 --> 02:58:33,003
Um,

6887
02:58:33,120 --> 02:58:35,760
I don't like in the gym I can still,

6888
02:58:36,000 --> 02:58:37,740
like I still walk through some things,

6889
02:58:38,070 --> 02:58:40,360
but I don't know about
in competition when,

6890
02:58:40,361 --> 02:58:41,340
when it's all in line.

6891
02:58:41,341 --> 02:58:41,851
Cause again,

6892
02:58:41,851 --> 02:58:43,500
I think your brain kind of,

6893
02:58:43,830 --> 02:58:45,240
you're in a different mindset,

6894
02:58:45,540 --> 02:58:45,900
you know,

6895
02:58:45,900 --> 02:58:49,260
think about that when you're sparring
right now because you really don't have a

6896
02:58:49,261 --> 02:58:50,370
need to write.

6897
02:58:50,970 --> 02:58:51,803
I um,

6898
02:58:52,200 --> 02:58:54,000
I still love sparring.

6899
02:58:54,030 --> 02:58:54,630
I don't,

6900
02:58:54,630 --> 02:58:56,580
I don't do it nearly as much as I used to.

6901
02:58:56,970 --> 02:58:57,421
Uh,

6902
02:58:57,421 --> 02:58:58,680
I do think about that.

6903
02:58:59,010 --> 02:58:59,843
So fun though.

6904
02:58:59,910 --> 02:59:01,050
It's so much fun.

6905
02:59:01,590 --> 02:59:02,070
You know,

6906
02:59:02,070 --> 02:59:02,903
and I'm like,

6907
02:59:03,300 --> 02:59:04,133
you only got one,

6908
02:59:04,310 --> 02:59:04,960
right?

6909
02:59:04,960 --> 02:59:05,420
Yeah.

6910
02:59:05,420 --> 02:59:06,210
You got one.

6911
02:59:06,210 --> 02:59:06,511
I don't,

6912
02:59:06,511 --> 02:59:06,811
I don't,

6913
02:59:06,811 --> 02:59:07,630
I don't want to be,

6914
02:59:07,630 --> 02:59:10,080
want to live the last
20 of that one drooling,

6915
02:59:10,140 --> 02:59:11,160
shitting your pants.

6916
02:59:11,390 --> 02:59:12,223
Word Mark.

6917
02:59:12,720 --> 02:59:13,501
I don't want that.

6918
02:59:13,501 --> 02:59:16,620
So I try to exercise my
brain as much as I can.

6919
02:59:16,621 --> 02:59:17,550
But what do you do?

6920
02:59:18,090 --> 02:59:18,481
You know,

6921
02:59:18,481 --> 02:59:19,314
reading,

6922
02:59:19,320 --> 02:59:20,310
I do a lot of,

6923
02:59:20,340 --> 02:59:21,840
a lot of the cognitive,

6924
02:59:21,841 --> 02:59:22,350
not co,

6925
02:59:22,350 --> 02:59:24,180
but brain cognitive games like,

6926
02:59:24,181 --> 02:59:24,510
uh,

6927
02:59:24,510 --> 02:59:24,781
you know,

6928
02:59:24,781 --> 02:59:27,650
a lot of things with
numbers and crosswords and,

6929
02:59:27,651 --> 02:59:27,841
and,

6930
02:59:27,841 --> 02:59:28,130
and,

6931
02:59:28,130 --> 02:59:28,350
and,

6932
02:59:28,350 --> 02:59:29,310
and I just,

6933
02:59:30,600 --> 02:59:34,470
that's a hard thing for me to not
do something because if I'm not,

6934
02:59:34,500 --> 02:59:36,960
if I'm awake and I'm not occupied,

6935
02:59:37,320 --> 02:59:38,550
my thoughts are just going.

6936
02:59:38,610 --> 02:59:40,350
So that's something else I've been doing.

6937
02:59:40,351 --> 02:59:40,650
I've been,

6938
02:59:40,650 --> 02:59:41,970
I've started to write things down.

6939
02:59:42,210 --> 02:59:44,580
I've been doing like
some stunt work acting,

6940
02:59:44,850 --> 02:59:45,121
right.

6941
02:59:45,121 --> 02:59:46,680
So I've been,

6942
02:59:46,710 --> 02:59:51,000
lately I've been watching old shows and
just watching it for the acting and,

6943
02:59:51,001 --> 02:59:51,601
and I'll,

6944
02:59:51,601 --> 02:59:55,110
I'll find a script and I'll stand in
front of a mirror by myself and do some,

6945
02:59:55,230 --> 02:59:57,810
do some things and tried
to pay some things out.

6946
02:59:57,810 --> 02:59:58,050
Like,

6947
02:59:58,050 --> 02:59:58,800
I'm just like,

6948
02:59:58,800 --> 02:59:59,260
I'm just,

6949
02:59:59,260 --> 03:00:00,480
I was just going through all of it.

6950
03:00:00,481 --> 03:00:00,811
I,

6951
03:00:00,811 --> 03:00:01,260
uh,

6952
03:00:01,260 --> 03:00:01,830
I did,

6953
03:00:01,830 --> 03:00:02,663
I did,

6954
03:00:02,820 --> 03:00:03,810
I did a small move.

6955
03:00:03,811 --> 03:00:05,320
They're doing a movie
about nick knew well.

6956
03:00:05,490 --> 03:00:06,030
Right.

6957
03:00:06,030 --> 03:00:06,371
And,

6958
03:00:06,371 --> 03:00:06,900
um,

6959
03:00:06,900 --> 03:00:07,711
I f I,

6960
03:00:07,711 --> 03:00:08,750
so I fight the cat.

6961
03:00:08,760 --> 03:00:12,840
The guy that's played nick knew well and
one scene early in his career was the

6962
03:00:12,841 --> 03:00:13,890
fighter has one our,

6963
03:00:14,020 --> 03:00:15,180
cause the guy in the movie,

6964
03:00:15,181 --> 03:00:15,871
everyone armor as well.

6965
03:00:15,871 --> 03:00:16,231
No,

6966
03:00:16,231 --> 03:00:16,561
but he,

6967
03:00:16,561 --> 03:00:17,460
they greenscreen it.

6968
03:00:17,610 --> 03:00:18,290
Oh,

6969
03:00:18,290 --> 03:00:19,081
I'm so,

6970
03:00:19,081 --> 03:00:19,680
so he's,

6971
03:00:19,680 --> 03:00:23,790
he's the whole time he has his green
sleeve over his arm and he has it out here

6972
03:00:23,791 --> 03:00:24,541
and he's moving it.

6973
03:00:24,541 --> 03:00:25,680
And we have,

6974
03:00:25,681 --> 03:00:30,030
we choreograph the fight and we have
to kind of address a account for all of

6975
03:00:30,031 --> 03:00:33,680
that in the choreography with the
green screen and all that are all low.

6976
03:00:34,020 --> 03:00:35,490
But I got a couple of lines.

6977
03:00:35,491 --> 03:00:38,220
I did some lines in the first time
I did lines with Kevin Pollak.

6978
03:00:38,400 --> 03:00:39,430
So that was cool for her.

6979
03:00:39,780 --> 03:00:40,290
You know,

6980
03:00:40,290 --> 03:00:41,160
that's pretty crazy.

6981
03:00:41,161 --> 03:00:41,940
Yeah.

6982
03:00:41,940 --> 03:00:42,331
And then,

6983
03:00:42,331 --> 03:00:42,690
um,

6984
03:00:42,690 --> 03:00:44,880
and then I did an episode of
ballers for the next season,

6985
03:00:45,600 --> 03:00:46,560
so that was cool.

6986
03:00:46,860 --> 03:00:47,940
Did you work with the Rock?

6987
03:00:48,030 --> 03:00:48,451
No,

6988
03:00:48,451 --> 03:00:49,111
I worked with,

6989
03:00:49,111 --> 03:00:49,500
um,

6990
03:00:49,500 --> 03:00:50,010
Ricky,

6991
03:00:50,010 --> 03:00:50,401
so,

6992
03:00:50,401 --> 03:00:51,450
so JD,

6993
03:00:51,510 --> 03:00:52,343
Washington,

6994
03:00:52,500 --> 03:00:53,490
so that was cool.

6995
03:00:53,810 --> 03:00:54,360
Um,

6996
03:00:54,360 --> 03:00:55,193
and I had met,

6997
03:00:55,340 --> 03:00:55,981
I didn't,

6998
03:00:55,981 --> 03:00:56,910
I didn't,

6999
03:00:57,540 --> 03:00:58,410
I watched these shows.

7000
03:00:58,411 --> 03:01:00,730
I didn't know his name was Jay d wash.

7001
03:01:00,731 --> 03:01:02,860
I just knew his name is
JD from being on set.

7002
03:01:02,861 --> 03:01:03,820
I always call him Ricky.

7003
03:01:03,910 --> 03:01:04,301
That was it.

7004
03:01:04,301 --> 03:01:05,100
Right.

7005
03:01:05,100 --> 03:01:05,530
Um,

7006
03:01:05,530 --> 03:01:10,090
somebody told me he was related to Denzel
Washington and then I find out that

7007
03:01:10,091 --> 03:01:12,490
his last name is Washington where
I'm on set and I'm looking at the,

7008
03:01:12,491 --> 03:01:14,290
the call sheet and I'm like,

7009
03:01:14,430 --> 03:01:14,550
Hey,

7010
03:01:14,550 --> 03:01:15,670
you're related to Denzel.

7011
03:01:16,000 --> 03:01:16,833
And he's like,

7012
03:01:16,840 --> 03:01:17,321
yeah,

7013
03:01:17,321 --> 03:01:18,340
he has this look on his face.

7014
03:01:18,341 --> 03:01:18,920
Like,

7015
03:01:18,920 --> 03:01:19,330
Oh fuck,

7016
03:01:19,330 --> 03:01:20,140
you know,

7017
03:01:20,140 --> 03:01:21,010
you know that.

7018
03:01:21,040 --> 03:01:21,641
And I'm like,

7019
03:01:21,641 --> 03:01:22,480
I knew he was related,

7020
03:01:22,481 --> 03:01:24,040
but I thought he would
tell me how at the time.

7021
03:01:24,041 --> 03:01:24,701
And I didn't know,

7022
03:01:24,701 --> 03:01:26,470
but I later I found out
that it was his dad.

7023
03:01:26,800 --> 03:01:28,090
Oh Shit,

7024
03:01:28,091 --> 03:01:28,924
this is that,

7025
03:01:29,140 --> 03:01:29,560
you know,

7026
03:01:29,560 --> 03:01:31,510
some from what the
information and I've got.

7027
03:01:31,690 --> 03:01:32,170
Oh.

7028
03:01:32,170 --> 03:01:32,920
And um,

7029
03:01:32,920 --> 03:01:33,753
so,

7030
03:01:33,760 --> 03:01:34,031
but,

7031
03:01:34,031 --> 03:01:34,521
but I'd,

7032
03:01:34,521 --> 03:01:37,090
I'd met his dad also worked with him on,

7033
03:01:37,091 --> 03:01:37,630
um,

7034
03:01:37,630 --> 03:01:38,291
equalizer.

7035
03:01:38,291 --> 03:01:39,610
We were for the equalizer to,

7036
03:01:39,611 --> 03:01:39,911
we were,

7037
03:01:39,911 --> 03:01:40,744
we were helping,

7038
03:01:40,750 --> 03:01:42,010
helping him build the scenes.

7039
03:01:42,040 --> 03:01:44,860
We choreographing the scenes and
teaching the choreography for that.

7040
03:01:45,610 --> 03:01:46,361
And I have this,

7041
03:01:46,361 --> 03:01:46,601
this,

7042
03:01:46,601 --> 03:01:47,434
um,

7043
03:01:47,890 --> 03:01:48,671
this thing where he,

7044
03:01:48,671 --> 03:01:50,350
he's given me voice lessons.

7045
03:01:50,770 --> 03:01:53,890
I have this thing with Denzel
Washington giving me voice lessons.

7046
03:01:54,100 --> 03:01:54,933
I'll show it to us.

7047
03:01:55,240 --> 03:01:55,810
Like he's,

7048
03:01:55,810 --> 03:01:56,261
you know,

7049
03:01:56,261 --> 03:01:56,531
these,

7050
03:01:56,531 --> 03:01:57,220
these,

7051
03:01:57,220 --> 03:02:01,470
these tongue twisters that he
says to practice annunciating Oh,

7052
03:02:01,570 --> 03:02:02,403
you know,

7053
03:02:02,720 --> 03:02:03,290
um,

7054
03:02:03,290 --> 03:02:04,180
it's kind of dope.

7055
03:02:04,181 --> 03:02:04,481
So,

7056
03:02:04,481 --> 03:02:05,021
so we're,

7057
03:02:05,021 --> 03:02:05,420
we're in,

7058
03:02:05,420 --> 03:02:06,041
in the gym,

7059
03:02:06,041 --> 03:02:07,660
we're working out and he's like,

7060
03:02:07,720 --> 03:02:08,210
so he tells,

7061
03:02:08,210 --> 03:02:09,660
he says them to me and he's,

7062
03:02:09,750 --> 03:02:10,181
he's like,

7063
03:02:10,181 --> 03:02:12,380
you should write this down
because my buddy tells him,

7064
03:02:12,381 --> 03:02:12,521
yeah,

7065
03:02:12,521 --> 03:02:13,630
he does the stuff on Fox,

7066
03:02:13,650 --> 03:02:16,540
on the Fox desk for UFC
and I'm so he's like,

7067
03:02:16,541 --> 03:02:18,610
he pays a little more
attention to me at that point.

7068
03:02:18,610 --> 03:02:18,851
He's like,

7069
03:02:18,851 --> 03:02:18,971
yeah,

7070
03:02:18,971 --> 03:02:19,900
he's going back to theater.

7071
03:02:19,901 --> 03:02:22,180
He wants to do some theater cause
he wants to clean up his stuff.

7072
03:02:22,540 --> 03:02:23,680
And so I was like,

7073
03:02:23,681 --> 03:02:24,461
you should write this down.

7074
03:02:24,461 --> 03:02:25,294
And I'm like,

7075
03:02:25,360 --> 03:02:25,661
fuck.

7076
03:02:25,661 --> 03:02:28,540
I grabbed my phone and I started recording
and then he sees that I'm recording.

7077
03:02:28,541 --> 03:02:29,770
So he comes over and he's like,

7078
03:02:29,771 --> 03:02:31,660
he's speaking into my phone and I'm like,

7079
03:02:31,820 --> 03:02:32,850
I have this shit on my foot.

7080
03:02:32,851 --> 03:02:35,890
Had this Denzel Washington
Voice coaching me.

7081
03:02:36,980 --> 03:02:37,813
Such huge,

7082
03:02:38,110 --> 03:02:38,831
super dope.

7083
03:02:38,831 --> 03:02:39,310
Right.

7084
03:02:39,310 --> 03:02:40,480
So that's what you're here for.

7085
03:02:40,600 --> 03:02:43,360
That's what you're going
to do other than Fox desk,

7086
03:02:43,390 --> 03:02:44,650
you're doing some acting.

7087
03:02:45,370 --> 03:02:46,203
Yeah.

7088
03:02:47,590 --> 03:02:48,510
It's like I'm a,

7089
03:02:48,760 --> 03:02:49,593
I'm a kid again.

7090
03:02:49,600 --> 03:02:50,290
Right.

7091
03:02:50,290 --> 03:02:51,070
And I have my side,

7092
03:02:51,070 --> 03:02:52,060
I had my sag card,

7093
03:02:52,270 --> 03:02:54,100
so I have a,

7094
03:02:54,160 --> 03:02:55,390
I have a ticket to the theme park.

7095
03:02:55,420 --> 03:03:00,420
So why not just try the rights
if it's something new to do.

7096
03:03:00,490 --> 03:03:01,010
Yeah,

7097
03:03:01,010 --> 03:03:01,720
yeah,

7098
03:03:01,720 --> 03:03:02,553
yeah.

7099
03:03:02,610 --> 03:03:03,430
That's what I'm doing.

7100
03:03:03,430 --> 03:03:04,990
I know Bisping springs
doing a lot of work.

7101
03:03:05,090 --> 03:03:06,010
It means doing a lot.

7102
03:03:06,020 --> 03:03:08,530
And I did a movie Bisbing well,

7103
03:03:08,531 --> 03:03:10,660
he had a big role in the film come.

7104
03:03:10,661 --> 03:03:11,620
We did a lot of shit.

7105
03:03:11,950 --> 03:03:12,850
He's doing a lot,

7106
03:03:12,851 --> 03:03:13,630
man.

7107
03:03:13,630 --> 03:03:14,320
Um,

7108
03:03:14,320 --> 03:03:18,370
there's quite a few guys like Jay
here on Jay's doing a lot of stunts.

7109
03:03:18,670 --> 03:03:19,030
You know,

7110
03:03:19,030 --> 03:03:19,863
eye

7111
03:03:21,170 --> 03:03:22,001
stents are great,

7112
03:03:22,001 --> 03:03:23,470
especially when you're doing fights.

7113
03:03:23,680 --> 03:03:25,660
But I'm 155 pounder.

7114
03:03:25,890 --> 03:03:26,201
We're out.

7115
03:03:26,201 --> 03:03:30,250
I mean like I'm not going to be doing a
whole lot of fighting and movies a guy

7116
03:03:30,251 --> 03:03:30,491
like,

7117
03:03:30,491 --> 03:03:31,810
like Tate right.

7118
03:03:31,900 --> 03:03:33,010
Tapes and tapes and doing

7119
03:03:34,610 --> 03:03:35,400
exactly.

7120
03:03:35,400 --> 03:03:36,233
He got,

7121
03:03:36,400 --> 03:03:37,060
he has,

7122
03:03:37,060 --> 03:03:41,340
he has the look and he's a big guy
so he's getting a lot of work in that

7123
03:03:41,380 --> 03:03:42,213
capacity.

7124
03:03:42,310 --> 03:03:43,143
Um,

7125
03:03:43,150 --> 03:03:44,050
but as a stunt man,

7126
03:03:44,051 --> 03:03:45,020
I'm a smaller guy and,

7127
03:03:45,021 --> 03:03:47,740
and most of the time when
that you want someone my size,

7128
03:03:47,741 --> 03:03:51,400
you're going to want someone
that can do other things like,

7129
03:03:51,401 --> 03:03:51,670
um,

7130
03:03:51,670 --> 03:03:54,430
a lot of the gymnast
and that type of thing.

7131
03:03:54,430 --> 03:03:55,600
And I can do some of that,

7132
03:03:55,601 --> 03:03:57,410
but nowhere near as good as those guys.

7133
03:03:57,440 --> 03:03:57,830
Right.

7134
03:03:57,830 --> 03:03:58,490
Um,

7135
03:03:58,490 --> 03:04:01,130
and I'm not learning
how to get hit by a car.

7136
03:04:01,550 --> 03:04:02,383
Ah,

7137
03:04:02,630 --> 03:04:03,770
get lit on fire.

7138
03:04:03,830 --> 03:04:04,431
You know what I mean?

7139
03:04:04,431 --> 03:04:05,500
Fall on a motorcycle.

7140
03:04:05,750 --> 03:04:06,583
That's not happening.

7141
03:04:06,620 --> 03:04:07,371
I'm not doing that.

7142
03:04:07,371 --> 03:04:08,151
So I want to,

7143
03:04:08,151 --> 03:04:09,170
I want to thank,

7144
03:04:10,280 --> 03:04:14,210
I want to get better at this acting thing
and try that out some cause cause it's

7145
03:04:14,211 --> 03:04:14,630
fun.

7146
03:04:14,630 --> 03:04:15,463
Also,

7147
03:04:15,860 --> 03:04:17,030
I played myself on the,

7148
03:04:17,031 --> 03:04:19,790
on the episode of ballers and I was like,

7149
03:04:20,270 --> 03:04:21,530
this feels good.

7150
03:04:22,130 --> 03:04:22,963
Like the,

7151
03:04:23,000 --> 03:04:23,200
the,

7152
03:04:23,200 --> 03:04:23,371
the,

7153
03:04:23,371 --> 03:04:23,751
the,

7154
03:04:23,751 --> 03:04:24,770
the acting thing.

7155
03:04:24,771 --> 03:04:25,311
It's like,

7156
03:04:25,311 --> 03:04:25,850
I'm,

7157
03:04:25,850 --> 03:04:26,690
this is fun.

7158
03:04:26,840 --> 03:04:27,270
This is a,

7159
03:04:27,270 --> 03:04:27,501
it's,

7160
03:04:27,501 --> 03:04:27,730
it's,

7161
03:04:27,730 --> 03:04:29,060
it's a different kind of rush,

7162
03:04:29,120 --> 03:04:29,750
you know,

7163
03:04:29,750 --> 03:04:30,290
so new thing.

7164
03:04:30,290 --> 03:04:30,550
I'm,

7165
03:04:30,550 --> 03:04:32,840
I'm to pick your brain
when like I'm going to,

7166
03:04:32,841 --> 03:04:34,040
I'm going to ask you for some,

7167
03:04:34,070 --> 03:04:35,450
some advice and tips.

7168
03:04:35,470 --> 03:04:36,303
You stand up.

7169
03:04:36,500 --> 03:04:37,251
I did a couple of,

7170
03:04:37,251 --> 03:04:38,130
I did a couple of seasons.

7171
03:04:38,370 --> 03:04:39,140
The darn bar.

7172
03:04:39,140 --> 03:04:40,210
I did wait to die.

7173
03:04:40,970 --> 03:04:41,900
I'm going to do it again.

7174
03:04:42,440 --> 03:04:43,101
I mean,

7175
03:04:43,101 --> 03:04:44,240
I've done it a few times.

7176
03:04:44,270 --> 03:04:45,080
I like it.

7177
03:04:45,080 --> 03:04:45,913
If you could do it.

7178
03:04:46,940 --> 03:04:48,140
I don't feel like I'm funny.

7179
03:04:48,141 --> 03:04:48,980
That's the problem.

7180
03:04:49,070 --> 03:04:49,521
You're funny.

7181
03:04:49,521 --> 03:04:50,690
Do you can do it.

7182
03:04:50,900 --> 03:04:51,470
It's it.

7183
03:04:51,470 --> 03:04:52,610
It's worked for everybody.

7184
03:04:52,650 --> 03:04:53,390
Yeah.

7185
03:04:53,390 --> 03:04:54,830
It seems a lot easier than it is.

7186
03:04:55,070 --> 03:04:56,240
It's not easy at all.

7187
03:04:56,280 --> 03:04:56,710
No.

7188
03:04:56,710 --> 03:04:57,500
Seems like it.

7189
03:04:57,500 --> 03:04:58,550
It's not easy at all.

7190
03:04:58,570 --> 03:04:59,403
Just talking.

7191
03:04:59,840 --> 03:05:00,673
How could that be hard?

7192
03:05:00,920 --> 03:05:01,461
But see,

7193
03:05:01,461 --> 03:05:02,090
that's the thing.

7194
03:05:02,090 --> 03:05:02,960
It's like people like,

7195
03:05:02,961 --> 03:05:03,161
man,

7196
03:05:03,161 --> 03:05:03,370
you,

7197
03:05:03,370 --> 03:05:04,510
you fought in an octagon.

7198
03:05:04,590 --> 03:05:05,960
You fucking moon means people.

7199
03:05:05,961 --> 03:05:06,381
Isn't that?

7200
03:05:06,381 --> 03:05:06,771
It's like,

7201
03:05:06,771 --> 03:05:06,921
yeah,

7202
03:05:06,921 --> 03:05:08,300
but I'm not looking at them.

7203
03:05:08,450 --> 03:05:08,661
You know,

7204
03:05:08,661 --> 03:05:09,381
the thing is to,

7205
03:05:09,381 --> 03:05:11,290
all new things are difficult.

7206
03:05:11,330 --> 03:05:12,920
It doesn't matter what
difficult things you do.

7207
03:05:12,921 --> 03:05:14,720
Try taking up chest for the first time.

7208
03:05:15,080 --> 03:05:16,820
It's difficult to try anything.

7209
03:05:16,850 --> 03:05:19,500
Everything that's hard to do is difficult.

7210
03:05:19,500 --> 03:05:21,290
It doesn't matter how many
difficult things you've done.

7211
03:05:21,680 --> 03:05:25,490
You might have a better understanding
of how to perform under under pressure

7212
03:05:25,950 --> 03:05:26,751
than other people do.

7213
03:05:26,751 --> 03:05:28,160
But it's still going to be hard.

7214
03:05:28,590 --> 03:05:28,820
It,

7215
03:05:28,820 --> 03:05:29,331
yeah,

7216
03:05:29,331 --> 03:05:29,721
nothing,

7217
03:05:29,721 --> 03:05:32,600
nothing worth doing is
easy because it was easy.

7218
03:05:32,601 --> 03:05:33,434
Everybody would do it.

7219
03:05:34,310 --> 03:05:35,030
I know.

7220
03:05:35,030 --> 03:05:35,863
That's the thing.

7221
03:05:36,030 --> 03:05:36,890
I um,

7222
03:05:36,920 --> 03:05:41,180
the other thing that I'm doing is I have
a do a show with this platform called

7223
03:05:41,181 --> 03:05:42,014
Pluto.

7224
03:05:42,160 --> 03:05:46,220
So I had the show called the thugs you
to master in squid show buddy the squid

7225
03:05:46,221 --> 03:05:46,391
way.

7226
03:05:46,391 --> 03:05:47,660
We got we interview,

7227
03:05:48,350 --> 03:05:50,690
we interview guys that
got flights coming up.

7228
03:05:50,691 --> 03:05:51,980
We do a lot of stuff with fighters,

7229
03:05:51,981 --> 03:05:52,671
will get coaches,

7230
03:05:52,671 --> 03:05:54,440
we get people that have
nothing to do with fighting.

7231
03:05:54,770 --> 03:05:55,400
But um,

7232
03:05:55,400 --> 03:05:55,821
we make,

7233
03:05:55,821 --> 03:05:56,890
we make it fun because we got,

7234
03:05:56,910 --> 03:05:58,640
what is this song on Pluto?

7235
03:05:58,670 --> 03:05:59,390
What does Pluto,

7236
03:05:59,390 --> 03:05:59,900
Pluto,

7237
03:05:59,900 --> 03:06:02,120
Pluto is a platform you
can get on your iPhone,

7238
03:06:02,560 --> 03:06:03,740
on a galaxy snap.

7239
03:06:03,980 --> 03:06:04,813
It's an APP.

7240
03:06:05,420 --> 03:06:05,951
You can get it on.

7241
03:06:05,951 --> 03:06:08,360
I like the playstation on
Apple TV and all these things.

7242
03:06:08,361 --> 03:06:08,900
Right.

7243
03:06:08,900 --> 03:06:09,261
And,

7244
03:06:09,261 --> 03:06:09,800
um,

7245
03:06:09,800 --> 03:06:10,431
do you know what it is?

7246
03:06:10,431 --> 03:06:11,264
You heard of it?

7247
03:06:11,860 --> 03:06:12,693
You know,

7248
03:06:13,970 --> 03:06:15,950
they got a 24 hour glory channel.

7249
03:06:16,090 --> 03:06:17,480
Once they got the glory went in 24,

7250
03:06:17,481 --> 03:06:18,110
seven,

7251
03:06:18,110 --> 03:06:21,980
they got a fight channel where
they have all the glory channel,

7252
03:06:21,981 --> 03:06:22,700
glory channel.

7253
03:06:22,700 --> 03:06:23,600
Holy Shit.

7254
03:06:24,050 --> 03:06:24,710
Okay.

7255
03:06:24,710 --> 03:06:25,520
And um,

7256
03:06:25,520 --> 03:06:25,731
yeah,

7257
03:06:25,731 --> 03:06:25,941
so,

7258
03:06:25,941 --> 03:06:26,720
so that's,

7259
03:06:26,720 --> 03:06:27,441
we do it over there.

7260
03:06:27,441 --> 03:06:28,071
We got a thing,

7261
03:06:28,071 --> 03:06:30,710
we do a thing called fight
body life where we um,

7262
03:06:31,130 --> 03:06:33,570
we watched the fights but we
just hang out with it's key.

7263
03:06:33,620 --> 03:06:37,760
It's watch the fights when you just hang
out and basically do a podcast while

7264
03:06:37,761 --> 03:06:37,941
we're,

7265
03:06:37,941 --> 03:06:38,774
while we're doing it.

7266
03:06:38,960 --> 03:06:39,771
No TV,

7267
03:06:39,771 --> 03:06:40,400
it's free.

7268
03:06:40,400 --> 03:06:41,240
Everything's free.

7269
03:06:41,510 --> 03:06:42,260
No Shit.

7270
03:06:42,260 --> 03:06:43,310
Hundred plus channels.

7271
03:06:43,311 --> 03:06:44,150
Foreign what you want.

7272
03:06:45,350 --> 03:06:47,600
They haven't got everything
on then this before.

7273
03:06:47,780 --> 03:06:48,021
No.

7274
03:06:48,021 --> 03:06:48,854
You know what I'm thinking of?

7275
03:06:48,860 --> 03:06:49,281
There's something,

7276
03:06:49,281 --> 03:06:50,480
I'm the Amazon.

7277
03:06:53,090 --> 03:06:54,830
What is the thing that's on TV?

7278
03:06:54,831 --> 03:06:55,860
The Amazon fire.

7279
03:06:56,950 --> 03:06:58,200
You can put this on that is that,

7280
03:06:58,230 --> 03:06:59,490
that's what I think I've seen it.

7281
03:06:59,550 --> 03:06:59,911
I seen,

7282
03:06:59,911 --> 03:07:04,740
I seen a dude who had it and it was a
whole channel that was dedicated to the

7283
03:07:04,950 --> 03:07:06,210
Montreal comedy festival.

7284
03:07:07,810 --> 03:07:09,240
They have this Devis standup chat.

7285
03:07:09,270 --> 03:07:09,720
Ah,

7286
03:07:09,720 --> 03:07:10,350
okay.

7287
03:07:10,350 --> 03:07:11,183
Nice.

7288
03:07:11,530 --> 03:07:12,780
So what does this show called again?

7289
03:07:12,860 --> 03:07:13,220
Um,

7290
03:07:13,220 --> 03:07:14,940
the thug Jitsu master and squid shell.

7291
03:07:14,990 --> 03:07:15,823
All right.

7292
03:07:16,630 --> 03:07:17,463
Uh,

7293
03:07:17,610 --> 03:07:17,881
dude,

7294
03:07:17,881 --> 03:07:18,750
it's already three o'clock.

7295
03:07:19,170 --> 03:07:19,590
Wow.

7296
03:07:19,590 --> 03:07:21,120
We've been doing this for how long now?

7297
03:07:21,210 --> 03:07:21,870
Over three hours.

7298
03:07:21,870 --> 03:07:22,703
Over three hours.

7299
03:07:23,520 --> 03:07:23,881
Crazy.

7300
03:07:23,881 --> 03:07:25,020
Right at a time warp.

7301
03:07:25,440 --> 03:07:26,430
How the fuck did that happen?

7302
03:07:27,360 --> 03:07:28,080
That's how it goes.

7303
03:07:28,080 --> 03:07:28,471
It's weird.

7304
03:07:28,471 --> 03:07:29,040
Yeah,

7305
03:07:29,040 --> 03:07:29,341
man.

7306
03:07:29,341 --> 03:07:29,820
Thank you for,

7307
03:07:29,820 --> 03:07:31,980
do we need to say anything more
about the Brendan Schaub thing?

7308
03:07:31,981 --> 03:07:34,080
Did we cover it enough man,

7309
03:07:34,140 --> 03:07:35,730
as far as it goes,

7310
03:07:36,540 --> 03:07:37,470
it's just like,

7311
03:07:38,600 --> 03:07:39,740
that's where we,

7312
03:07:39,900 --> 03:07:40,650
we like,

7313
03:07:40,650 --> 03:07:42,320
we need to talk him and hit you,

7314
03:07:42,380 --> 03:07:42,960
you know?

7315
03:07:42,960 --> 03:07:43,410
Yeah.

7316
03:07:43,410 --> 03:07:46,590
So it's a weird situation for me because
I love the guy and he's one of my best

7317
03:07:46,591 --> 03:07:50,820
friends and also I can't defend what
he said cause it doesn't totally make

7318
03:07:50,821 --> 03:07:51,150
sense.

7319
03:07:51,150 --> 03:07:51,690
Yeah.

7320
03:07:51,690 --> 03:07:53,400
And so like what I'm saying,

7321
03:07:53,401 --> 03:07:54,840
when I said he talks too much,

7322
03:07:54,900 --> 03:07:55,733
I do too.

7323
03:07:56,070 --> 03:07:57,000
I say stupid shit.

7324
03:07:57,150 --> 03:07:58,230
I don't mean to say stupid shit.

7325
03:07:58,260 --> 03:07:59,550
I don't say that stupid.

7326
03:07:59,570 --> 03:08:00,120
Um,

7327
03:08:00,120 --> 03:08:01,260
I didn't say that thing.

7328
03:08:01,320 --> 03:08:02,190
I wouldn't say it like that.

7329
03:08:02,220 --> 03:08:02,640
Yeah.

7330
03:08:02,640 --> 03:08:04,170
But sometimes you say things,

7331
03:08:05,040 --> 03:08:06,690
you don't even know why
the fuck you're saying it.

7332
03:08:06,720 --> 03:08:07,081
You know?

7333
03:08:07,081 --> 03:08:09,720
And a lot of it also was loss,

7334
03:08:09,730 --> 03:08:11,940
like just ranting.

7335
03:08:12,060 --> 03:08:12,511
Like you,

7336
03:08:12,511 --> 03:08:15,780
you're going to these rants and you say
shit and then you like see if you can

7337
03:08:15,781 --> 03:08:17,130
back it up once you said it.

7338
03:08:17,220 --> 03:08:17,581
Yeah.

7339
03:08:17,581 --> 03:08:19,350
Like just don't revisit dumb shit.

7340
03:08:19,410 --> 03:08:20,243
That's like,

7341
03:08:20,310 --> 03:08:21,330
it was insensitive.

7342
03:08:21,690 --> 03:08:25,680
It didn't make sense and it was an
insensitive and I bet he regrets it.

7343
03:08:27,240 --> 03:08:27,750
Well,

7344
03:08:27,750 --> 03:08:28,583
I mean,

7345
03:08:29,100 --> 03:08:29,933
I don't know.

7346
03:08:30,060 --> 03:08:31,320
That's an assumption we're making,

7347
03:08:31,321 --> 03:08:31,501
right?

7348
03:08:31,501 --> 03:08:31,751
Yeah.

7349
03:08:31,751 --> 03:08:33,540
I'm glad I know the guy.

7350
03:08:34,020 --> 03:08:35,160
That's why I'm saying it.

7351
03:08:35,220 --> 03:08:35,700
Yeah.

7352
03:08:35,700 --> 03:08:38,310
He's not a bad guy and you
stretch the imagination.

7353
03:08:38,311 --> 03:08:39,000
He's awesome.

7354
03:08:39,000 --> 03:08:39,350
Um,

7355
03:08:39,350 --> 03:08:40,950
I'm not a of the of the,

7356
03:08:41,040 --> 03:08:42,200
I'm not the guy saying like,

7357
03:08:42,220 --> 03:08:43,290
you're racist saying this,

7358
03:08:43,300 --> 03:08:44,910
like that's like my,

7359
03:08:44,911 --> 03:08:47,450
my thing is when you're talking about the,

7360
03:08:47,451 --> 03:08:48,001
the first,

7361
03:08:48,001 --> 03:08:48,840
the initial part of it,

7362
03:08:48,841 --> 03:08:50,310
and I conveyed this to him,

7363
03:08:50,520 --> 03:08:51,240
you know,

7364
03:08:51,240 --> 03:08:54,930
was you're saying me or my brother or
my sister aren't good enough to be here.

7365
03:08:54,990 --> 03:08:55,950
So like that's,

7366
03:08:55,960 --> 03:08:59,580
that's disrespectful because I fully
believe that we all are and that,

7367
03:08:59,581 --> 03:08:59,821
that,

7368
03:08:59,821 --> 03:09:00,060
that,

7369
03:09:00,060 --> 03:09:02,730
so that part and he apologized
for that and we're cool there,

7370
03:09:03,030 --> 03:09:03,421
you know?

7371
03:09:03,421 --> 03:09:04,320
And then then,

7372
03:09:04,321 --> 03:09:04,860
then why you,

7373
03:09:04,860 --> 03:09:06,060
why are you talking about like,

7374
03:09:06,390 --> 03:09:08,610
this is what I see in
myself because no dog,

7375
03:09:08,640 --> 03:09:09,151
that's not,

7376
03:09:09,151 --> 03:09:10,200
that's not how it is.

7377
03:09:11,280 --> 03:09:11,731
You're not,

7378
03:09:11,731 --> 03:09:12,960
you're not a psychologist,

7379
03:09:13,050 --> 03:09:13,980
not a psychiatrist.

7380
03:09:13,981 --> 03:09:18,470
You have no qualifications to
to speak on my mental state.

7381
03:09:18,510 --> 03:09:18,780
Like,

7382
03:09:18,780 --> 03:09:20,900
like let's just weird too
that you guys haven't,

7383
03:09:21,900 --> 03:09:22,110
uh,

7384
03:09:22,110 --> 03:09:25,180
I think he's on know that's things out.

7385
03:09:25,220 --> 03:09:29,070
Sometimes someone says something instead
of just straight up saying they fucked

7386
03:09:29,071 --> 03:09:29,700
up.

7387
03:09:29,700 --> 03:09:30,780
They say I fucked up.

7388
03:09:30,990 --> 03:09:32,820
But yeah,

7389
03:09:33,000 --> 03:09:33,391
you know,

7390
03:09:33,391 --> 03:09:33,861
I fucked it up.

7391
03:09:33,861 --> 03:09:34,441
But you know,

7392
03:09:34,441 --> 03:09:35,274
he's,

7393
03:09:35,310 --> 03:09:37,690
his issue is because of this or you know,

7394
03:09:37,800 --> 03:09:39,810
something else is going on with him.

7395
03:09:39,811 --> 03:09:41,670
It's making him react this way.

7396
03:09:42,240 --> 03:09:42,660
Yeah.

7397
03:09:42,660 --> 03:09:43,340
Yeah.

7398
03:09:43,340 --> 03:09:43,950
I,

7399
03:09:43,950 --> 03:09:45,330
I'm more concerned with his pants,

7400
03:09:45,390 --> 03:09:49,290
those shred it up pants and wears those
disturbing way more than what he said.

7401
03:09:49,320 --> 03:09:49,830
I can't,

7402
03:09:49,830 --> 03:09:50,850
can't defend either one.

7403
03:09:51,300 --> 03:09:51,631
Yeah,

7404
03:09:51,631 --> 03:09:54,100
I'm just wear women's pants.

7405
03:09:54,280 --> 03:09:55,150
I don't think they're women's.

7406
03:09:55,500 --> 03:09:59,080
They just holding them and
hold it on cause it back.

7407
03:09:59,081 --> 03:10:01,390
We went through that at the beginning
of the show and they have holding them.

7408
03:10:01,420 --> 03:10:02,590
It depends on how many holes,

7409
03:10:02,620 --> 03:10:03,453
right?

7410
03:10:03,610 --> 03:10:04,660
Like depends on like the whole,

7411
03:10:05,400 --> 03:10:05,560
well,

7412
03:10:05,560 --> 03:10:06,670
if you earn those holes,

7413
03:10:07,270 --> 03:10:08,650
like if you work construction,

7414
03:10:08,680 --> 03:10:09,041
you got it.

7415
03:10:09,041 --> 03:10:09,970
Like a real hole.

7416
03:10:10,030 --> 03:10:10,181
Yeah.

7417
03:10:10,181 --> 03:10:10,601
You get you,

7418
03:10:10,601 --> 03:10:12,070
you get your pen snagged on it.

7419
03:10:12,490 --> 03:10:13,480
You gotta do what you gotta do.

7420
03:10:13,650 --> 03:10:13,830
You know,

7421
03:10:13,830 --> 03:10:14,663
if you're a farmer,

7422
03:10:14,690 --> 03:10:16,750
you got like real Barb
wire holes and your pants.

7423
03:10:16,870 --> 03:10:17,950
That's a different animal,

7424
03:10:18,690 --> 03:10:19,031
you know?

7425
03:10:19,031 --> 03:10:19,420
That's,

7426
03:10:19,420 --> 03:10:20,253
that's okay.

7427
03:10:20,380 --> 03:10:21,280
You earn those holes.

7428
03:10:21,310 --> 03:10:22,420
You wore your jeans out.

7429
03:10:22,570 --> 03:10:23,800
They started ripping in places.

7430
03:10:23,980 --> 03:10:24,640
Okay,

7431
03:10:24,640 --> 03:10:25,030
okay.

7432
03:10:25,030 --> 03:10:26,350
You can't afford to buy some new ones,

7433
03:10:26,440 --> 03:10:29,200
but if you paid a lot of mine for
pants that are already fucked up,

7434
03:10:29,780 --> 03:10:31,420
you saw that shit in a magazine somewhere.

7435
03:10:31,870 --> 03:10:33,580
That's what bothers me about Brendan

7436
03:10:35,140 --> 03:10:35,973
fucking pants.

7437
03:10:36,610 --> 03:10:37,690
I thought that this bothers me too,

7438
03:10:37,691 --> 03:10:39,970
but I w what really bothers me,

7439
03:10:39,971 --> 03:10:40,900
I like you a lot.

7440
03:10:40,970 --> 03:10:41,920
You're always been cool.

7441
03:10:42,310 --> 03:10:42,851
And uh,

7442
03:10:42,851 --> 03:10:43,960
I think you do a great job.

7443
03:10:43,990 --> 03:10:47,080
And I said that very early on
when you first started doing it.

7444
03:10:47,140 --> 03:10:49,360
I remember I tweeted it or something.

7445
03:10:49,420 --> 03:10:50,050
I actually,

7446
03:10:50,050 --> 03:10:51,140
and you said it to me too,

7447
03:10:51,141 --> 03:10:51,881
the last time I was here,

7448
03:10:51,881 --> 03:10:53,490
I was in Joe and I came to do a glory,

7449
03:10:53,690 --> 03:10:54,700
a companion with you.

7450
03:10:55,250 --> 03:10:56,110
And I remember,

7451
03:10:56,111 --> 03:10:56,801
I remember that.

7452
03:10:56,801 --> 03:10:58,390
I remember everything you say Joe.

7453
03:10:58,450 --> 03:10:59,950
Like even even when did,

7454
03:10:59,960 --> 03:11:00,793
cause I don't,

7455
03:11:01,360 --> 03:11:04,780
especially when it's about me because
there was a time when you were like,

7456
03:11:04,810 --> 03:11:05,471
I look at Josh,

7457
03:11:05,471 --> 03:11:07,360
he's so strong how he
just gets right back up.

7458
03:11:07,480 --> 03:11:08,140
It's just,

7459
03:11:08,140 --> 03:11:08,621
and he's just,

7460
03:11:08,621 --> 03:11:09,490
he's the strongest guy.

7461
03:11:09,550 --> 03:11:10,510
Oh,

7462
03:11:11,320 --> 03:11:12,340
I remember that.

7463
03:11:12,580 --> 03:11:13,210
I remember that.

7464
03:11:13,210 --> 03:11:16,090
I love it because there's
a couple of times when,

7465
03:11:16,091 --> 03:11:16,510
um,

7466
03:11:16,510 --> 03:11:18,760
you're not like disparaging
of either fighter,

7467
03:11:19,000 --> 03:11:19,541
but um,

7468
03:11:19,541 --> 03:11:20,890
there's a couple of times when you,

7469
03:11:20,891 --> 03:11:23,880
you start seeing the
strength in another guy and,

7470
03:11:24,320 --> 03:11:27,850
and there's two fights for me where that
happened and I was able to just clip

7471
03:11:27,851 --> 03:11:29,890
him right as you're giving
the other guy some praise.

7472
03:11:29,920 --> 03:11:30,431
Perfect.

7473
03:11:30,431 --> 03:11:31,150
So I was like,

7474
03:11:31,150 --> 03:11:31,481
yeah,

7475
03:11:31,481 --> 03:11:31,811
Joe,

7476
03:11:31,811 --> 03:11:32,644
shut up guys.

7477
03:11:32,660 --> 03:11:33,493
Some love.

7478
03:11:34,300 --> 03:11:35,081
Give him some love.

7479
03:11:35,081 --> 03:11:35,914

7480
03:11:36,000 --> 03:11:36,731

Same thing.

Just massive.

7485
03:11:42,290 --> 03:11:43,000
All right.
