1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,010
Oh,
it was fucking brutal,

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,060
but I was like,
you know,

3
00:00:03,061 --> 00:00:05,120
I've done a bunch of podcasts that dom
sitting there.

4
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:06,750
He's like,
what are you talking about?

5
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:12,180
The whole podcast did.
What do you want to talk about?

6
00:00:12,181 --> 00:00:15,310
We talked about sports for about 50
minutes comedy for five and that was it.

7
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:19,110
It sounds like Dot Moreira and we're
live with Jenny Johnson.

8
00:00:19,111 --> 00:00:20,130
High Five.
What's up?

9
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,480
What up?
First of all,

10
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:22,710
that's fantastic.
Twitter name.

11
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:23,970
Thank you.
How'd you get that?

12
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,920
Because Jenny Johnson was taken and I
had to get clever.

13
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,020
I was like,
well I like high five.

14
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:36,060
Let's go with that.
But I've had people that have told me I

15
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,920
was at you or you're making fun of
people dates be.

16
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:40,170
I don't think so.
No,

17
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:43,200
he asked me that.
I had been asked that a lot and I was

18
00:00:43,201 --> 00:00:44,034
like,
what do you mean?

19
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,310
Well Ahi and the number five,
you know the Roman Numerals v.

20
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:51,280
So like I was going to be Jenny HIV.
What the fuck?

21
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:54,840
I'm saying do a lot of stupid shit,
but

22
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,400
that's hilarious.
So someone more than one.

23
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:03,210
I've been asked by several people like
online or in person.

24
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:04,241
No,
no,

25
00:01:04,241 --> 00:01:05,610
no.
I just like high fives.

26
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,010
Like that was it.
Now that you brought that up is probably

27
00:01:08,011 --> 00:01:11,520
going to be like some blog posts written
about it and a conspiracy will get

28
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:12,331
formed.
Yeah,

29
00:01:12,331 --> 00:01:13,110
that.
I like that.

30
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:14,260
That's what you're trying to do.
Right?

31
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:18,060
That's the type of things that like,
like really wacky people that believe in

32
00:01:18,061 --> 00:01:23,061
the Illuminati would start to sort of
say the d five is actually the jumps in

33
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:26,210
each.
I'm like,

34
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:28,600
my birthday's in May to number five,
you know,

35
00:01:28,601 --> 00:01:29,540
it was just like,
okay.

36
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:32,010
So I was just kind of doing it through
that a little bit too.

37
00:01:32,011 --> 00:01:32,530
Like,
Hey,

38
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:34,330
high five other number,
you know,

39
00:01:34,331 --> 00:01:38,670
like I actually had no,
it had nothing to do with anything.

40
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,560
The number,
the name Jenny Johnson was just taken.

41
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:45,330
You sound a little defensive.
I started to believe that maybe I've got

42
00:01:45,331 --> 00:01:48,300
the full blown,
full blown disease.

43
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,270
Is Hiv even the disease anymore?
I mean it is,

44
00:01:51,271 --> 00:01:53,700
but nobody dies.
But now I feel like now it's like

45
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,330
whooping cough or something.
Kids.

46
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,020
Oh my God.
Do you remember the moment when there's

47
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,610
a few moments where I remember like when
Sam Kinison died,

48
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:04,740
you know,
like things along those lines when you

49
00:02:04,741 --> 00:02:08,790
found out that someone was done.
But when I heard that Magic Johnson had

50
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:11,670
HIV,
I was in the car with my girlfriend and

51
00:02:11,671 --> 00:02:13,740
we were in Boston.
We were driving.

52
00:02:13,741 --> 00:02:15,810
We were both like,
Holy Shit.

53
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:20,040
It was like beginning of like the
walking dead when people started to get

54
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:20,590
sick.
Like,

55
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,320
oh no,
fuck,

56
00:02:22,321 --> 00:02:23,730
it's on.
It is magic.

57
00:02:23,731 --> 00:02:27,240
Johnson of all people Jensen's famous.
I'd say the one that killed me too is a

58
00:02:27,241 --> 00:02:28,074
easy eating.

59
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:31,540
Yeah.
He died of aids and that was also like,

60
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,420
it's just,
you didn't see that coming.

61
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,760
Like I guess I,
I think I just assumed maybe it was all

62
00:02:38,761 --> 00:02:40,610
in New York.
It was gay guys that are getting,

63
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:41,670
you know,
like as a,

64
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:42,430
as a kid,
you know,

65
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:42,720
I,
that's,

66
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,790
I didn't know any better all in New
York.

67
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:45,960
That's funny.
Why New York?

68
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,210
I don't know why,
because every,

69
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:48,660
every scene,
every,

70
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:50,540
you know,
like everything you saw in the news that

71
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:53,280
it was always coming from New York
because they were too lazy to get out in

72
00:02:53,281 --> 00:02:56,280
the rest of the world.
That's what you would see.

73
00:02:56,281 --> 00:02:57,650
I'm like,
well,

74
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,890
how does this happen?
Yeah,

75
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,770
it's a weird one.
That was a weird one.

76
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,190
Like easy.
He was the weirdest one because like,

77
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:08,560
what was he doing?
Was He doing intervenous drugs?

78
00:03:08,561 --> 00:03:11,890
Was He having unprotected sex?
Sex?

79
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:12,724
No,
it was just.

80
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:17,650
But it was with a lot of
girls that had,

81
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:20,740
that had used it as Tommy Lee not have
aids.

82
00:03:20,741 --> 00:03:24,850
Then how does it like,
there's a lot of of titus or something,

83
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:28,090
but doesn't he have that from heroin?
Allegedly.

84
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,170
They're all doing it in the bud.
Whoa.

85
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,760
How dare you
didn't mean it.

86
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:38,920
Isn't that the Charlie Sheen thing?
Charlie Sheen was blowing some guy that

87
00:03:38,921 --> 00:03:41,740
was smoking crack and there's a video it
was allegedly

88
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,100
did,
but I didn't know if it was real.

89
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:47,020
Like when Charlie,
she even goes on.

90
00:03:47,021 --> 00:03:51,080
Matt Lauer it all and it wasn't like
Magic Johnson spelled where it was like,

91
00:03:51,081 --> 00:03:52,540
and I'm going to be an activist for
this.

92
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:53,620
He's like,
it's over.

93
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,430
Not panties whores.
Any anymore money there.

94
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,650
There was nothing that was good or
productive.

95
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:02,480
Know with people that I'm an activist.
No,

96
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:05,890
just not paying these horses anymore.
I've paid $10,000,000 and I'm done

97
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:10,090
because he's paid $10,000,000.
Blackmailed by a bunch of different

98
00:04:10,091 --> 00:04:13,840
women who had gotten to his house and I
guess open his medicine cabinet and saw

99
00:04:13,841 --> 00:04:18,130
his HIV medication.
Took a picture with their cell phone and

100
00:04:18,131 --> 00:04:21,430
said,
pay up or I'm sending this out to the

101
00:04:21,431 --> 00:04:24,430
press if I was Charlie Sheen,
so I took that shit to get high.

102
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,830
If you smoke crack and take HIV
medication,

103
00:04:26,831 --> 00:04:29,780
you go to another dimension.
So good walking.

104
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:34,830
Amazing
for a little riddle in there to cut off.

105
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:41,980
I've got to imagine that stuff has got
to be somewhat psychoactive.

106
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,750
I don't know.
I have this drink and do drugs with like

107
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,460
other sure.
Street drugs with it.

108
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:50,050
Yeah,
because like if you do certain drugs

109
00:04:50,051 --> 00:04:52,030
with other drugs that dances them,
right?

110
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:56,160
Candy flipping and all that jazz.
What is Candy Flip Candy flip is this

111
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,950
wacky kids when they do the acid with
molly,

112
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,790
like they do Mtma and acid together.
Wow.

113
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:05,270
It's supposed to be amazing.
Supposed to survive.

114
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,420
If I didn't have kids,
I'd fucking jump in there.

115
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:10,420
I will give it a shot.
I feel like this might be worth dying

116
00:05:10,421 --> 00:05:12,190
for.
I can't leave behind him.

117
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:15,570
How'd your dad died serving his country.
It was flipping.

118
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:17,980
My Dad was candy.
Flip it with some 20 year olds.

119
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:24,330
Get to say that I guess.
Right?

120
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,560
I'm sure they brag about it.
Yeah,

121
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,010
that's,
that's my old man.

122
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,060
That poor fuck.
He's a fascinating guy though because he

123
00:05:31,061 --> 00:05:35,410
is fascinating.
He was on one of the worst sitcoms ever

124
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:38,290
that was successful.
Like that fucking two and a half men was

125
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:39,460
so bad.
It's.

126
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,120
I tried to watch one episode.
I couldn't.

127
00:05:43,121 --> 00:05:44,080
I couldn't do it.
I mean,

128
00:05:44,081 --> 00:05:47,560
I couldn't even make it through like so
the next break for,

129
00:05:47,561 --> 00:05:49,300
you know,
it's not for me,

130
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:54,330
but it's for somebody obviously giantly
successful and to even have him fired

131
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:57,800
and to bring another lead on and it
still works,

132
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,440
but it didn't get canceled it.
I know,

133
00:06:00,441 --> 00:06:03,760
but I thought it worked for a while.
How long do they do it with a coach?

134
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:06,920
A couple of years.
It did work for a bit.

135
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,020
Even noticed the people that are
watching that,

136
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:11,270
they're all on Ahcccs.
They're just fucking sitting in front of

137
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:12,650
the TV,
whacked out of their head.

138
00:06:12,651 --> 00:06:16,430
They're
just waiting for the laugh track to kick

139
00:06:16,431 --> 00:06:21,431
in so they can laugh it.
The commercial going to be on.

140
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:26,060
They get excited for commercials.
So commercial coming on soon and I'm

141
00:06:26,061 --> 00:06:28,890
sure the commercials were really
appropriate for that shout down.

142
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:32,030
Well those guys,
that guy who Charlie Sheen feuded with

143
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:32,990
him.
Yeah,

144
00:06:32,991 --> 00:06:35,450
he's awesome at making those kinds of
sitcoms.

145
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:40,480
He knows that he's done it a bunch
successful as shit to that guy.

146
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,460
If I was on a sitcom with him,
I would ask no questions.

147
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,780
He knows exactly what the fuck he's
doing.

148
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,070
You had read the script and go,
this is.

149
00:06:46,071 --> 00:06:47,920
This is the funniest thing she'd ever
read.

150
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,350
Ready to go.
Just tell me what the words are right

151
00:06:51,351 --> 00:06:54,850
before I say
this,

152
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,140
what are rehearsed this?
But it's perfect.

153
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,033
No,
it's amazing.

154
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:00,560
It's totally amazing.
He knows how to hit that frequency.

155
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:02,930
There's like a,
like a dog whistle.

156
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,990
Is it just,
is it people in Oxy,

157
00:07:05,991 --> 00:07:07,280
do you think?
Or do you just think it's like kind of

158
00:07:07,281 --> 00:07:09,740
middle America just get home from work
and it's,

159
00:07:09,741 --> 00:07:10,574
it's,
um,

160
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:13,070
it's on CBS.
There's definitely that.

161
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:15,050
There's definitely the Middle America
thing.

162
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:19,730
It's not offensive and it's a,
it's an easy watch,

163
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,620
you know,
like I've always said like,

164
00:07:21,621 --> 00:07:25,640
how the fuck does anybody watch keeping
up with the Kardashians until I watched

165
00:07:25,641 --> 00:07:30,641
it and the fucking thing is so bad,
but it's compelling the air out loud and

166
00:07:31,281 --> 00:07:34,010
just shit talk,
like allow things.

167
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,510
I punched my dog.
No,

168
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,160
don't do that.
I feel like a lot of people,

169
00:07:37,161 --> 00:07:38,870
I feel like a lot of people hate watch
it.

170
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:41,720
Yeah,
they definitely for sure.

171
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,670
I think there's plenty of people,
sadly enough that like it.

172
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:46,790
There's a lot of people that like,
I think a lot of people actually watch

173
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:48,290
it just because they hate it.
Well,

174
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:50,660
it's,
it's one of those things is they've

175
00:07:50,661 --> 00:07:53,120
become,
there's so much focus on them that

176
00:07:53,121 --> 00:07:55,710
they've become a thing.
So when,

177
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:59,930
when the camera's on people.
I have this theory about television fame

178
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,620
and just any,
any form of media and my theory is that

179
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:08,890
it hijacks these ancient reward systems
that are in place for us to follow

180
00:08:09,111 --> 00:08:12,080
successful people.
So like say if we were going to tribe

181
00:08:12,081 --> 00:08:17,081
together and all the three of us were in
a tribe together and Jamie just fucking

182
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:22,500
slayed all the intruders and figured out
how to get the food and new world,

183
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,830
the water was,
we'd be like,

184
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,080
we've got a foul Jamie.

185
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,040
Jamie's a bad motherfucker.
We got to follow him.

186
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,830
And so Jamie would talk in front of the
Campfire and we would listen.

187
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:37,160
That's sort of like a natural thing.
You follow successful behavior.

188
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:40,010
Well,
when a camera's on someone for whatever

189
00:08:40,011 --> 00:08:41,090
reason,
we,

190
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:45,140
we think that that person is successful.
So they talk,

191
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,450
they talk and we see all the money they
have,

192
00:08:47,451 --> 00:08:50,840
we see the cars they drive and all the
nails and the purses and all the jazz

193
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:51,891
and we'd go,
oh,

194
00:08:51,891 --> 00:08:53,870
they have all the good stuff.
We have to follow them.

195
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:57,210
And it sort hijacks this thing that's
weird.

196
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:01,950
I don't think we're designed for media.
I think that television and film and

197
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:05,140
music and all that stuff,
it hijacks this part of,

198
00:09:05,141 --> 00:09:08,010
of,
of being a human being that is a.

199
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,820
it's just unaccustomed to these sounds
and these images,

200
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:16,590
like you go to a movie and you see a,
you know Brad Pitt or whatever.

201
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:21,570
His head is fucking 15 feet tall.
Every time he talks the music plays is

202
00:09:21,571 --> 00:09:26,100
the words are perfect because they're
all labored by a group of writers.

203
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:30,750
They've worked at it for weeks to get
the right sequence of words and the

204
00:09:30,751 --> 00:09:35,751
right order and the right way to say it.
And they practiced it hijacks you and

205
00:09:36,121 --> 00:09:37,530
then you run into them in person.
You're like,

206
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:39,070
oh shit,
you are

207
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,080
dumb as shit.
Holy Hell.

208
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,500
There was an interview that he did once.
I forget who the fuck it was,

209
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,960
um,
who he was doing an interview with

210
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:49,261
those,
like,

211
00:09:49,261 --> 00:09:51,540
who's this fucking moron that,
uh,

212
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,640
whoever the guy is like Larry King's
interviewing,

213
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,781
like,
who the fuck is this?

214
00:09:54,781 --> 00:09:57,930
It was on TV and then I turned around
the corner and I saw that it was Brad

215
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:58,171
Pitt.
I was like,

216
00:09:58,171 --> 00:10:01,620
Holy Shit.
Brad Pitt.

217
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,930
Dude.
Was it bad?

218
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,690
You're boring as fuck.
Yeah.

219
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,520
It was boring.
It is.

220
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:12,560
Is it worse that they're boring or is it
worse when they have been famous for so

221
00:10:12,751 --> 00:10:15,180
long that they have the answers to
everything?

222
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:20,310
I think he's probably so tired from
fucking Angelina Jolie all the time that

223
00:10:20,311 --> 00:10:24,030
he just has no energy for thinking.
And all those kids was kids running

224
00:10:24,031 --> 00:10:27,270
around screaming and before her it was
Jennifer Aniston.

225
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:30,590
Probably reading scripts are there all
the time till 3:00 in the morning just

226
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,980
in brush brushing each other's hair and.

227
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:36,390
But he doesn't have to be,
you know,

228
00:10:36,391 --> 00:10:38,070
it's almost like he's like a lottery
winner.

229
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:40,920
He's got great features.
He was a movie star from the time he was

230
00:10:40,921 --> 00:10:43,440
very young.
No need to develop a personality

231
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:45,010
whatsoever.
If you're pretty,

232
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,440
it works for you.
I've looked at it again,

233
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,750
you know,
here's my thing on Angelina Jolie and

234
00:10:48,751 --> 00:10:53,220
Brad Pitt who out of all the,
like the really famous movie star type

235
00:10:53,221 --> 00:10:57,090
people has ever done more good.
Like that is true.

236
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,760
They do so much good.
There's so charitable.

237
00:10:59,761 --> 00:11:01,790
They're always involved in all these,
uh,

238
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:06,630
charitable
functions and go to the shitty parts of

239
00:11:06,631 --> 00:11:11,631
the world to adopt like 50 kids a week.
Constantly adopting kids.

240
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,180
This gang of kids have a gang of kids.
That's entirely true.

241
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:16,500
I don't think you have all those kids at
attention.

242
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,000
They don't.
They have a tribe.

243
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:19,850
They don't.
I bet they each have a nanny.

244
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,930
The nanny think they each have a spotter
and

245
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:30,870
each kid has their own.
Whether the dudes boring or not,

246
00:11:30,871 --> 00:11:32,520
but I don't know,
maybe those fucking interviews are

247
00:11:32,521 --> 00:11:33,570
boring to,
you know,

248
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:34,423
it's like,
it's far.

249
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,870
Jesus wasn't the.
I don't even know if it was Larry King.

250
00:11:36,871 --> 00:11:38,700
I,
I can't remember who the hell it was he

251
00:11:38,701 --> 00:11:39,534
was talking to.
But I was,

252
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:41,400
I remember I was in the other room and I
was like,

253
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:43,590
who is this boring dude?
It's getting interviewed.

254
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,820
And then I turned the corner.
I was like,

255
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:47,850
that's Brad Pitt proud.
You're boring,

256
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,790
boring.
You should be fucking psyched.

257
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,990
He should be like a brat pack.

258
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,790
I think it's really funny when you go to
like,

259
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:57,100
um,
if I have like people come into town,

260
00:11:57,101 --> 00:11:58,660
they always want to go to a taping of a
show,

261
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,570
you know?
And so I've used whatever connection I

262
00:12:01,571 --> 00:12:02,021
have.
Okay,

263
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:05,350
we'll go to this.
I love watching the painful look on the

264
00:12:05,351 --> 00:12:07,300
interviewer's face during commercials,
you know,

265
00:12:07,301 --> 00:12:11,230
like whatever show it is like fuck that
fucking guy,

266
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,660
you know,
where they're just reaching and it's

267
00:12:13,661 --> 00:12:15,130
really hard.
Like I can tell,

268
00:12:15,131 --> 00:12:16,450
you know.
Then there's those guests.

269
00:12:16,451 --> 00:12:18,970
It just get it.
They're very likable and they're good at

270
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:21,340
it and a chatty and work the crowd and
everything.

271
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:24,190
Like I saw,
I think it was like Nick Cannon was on

272
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:27,640
Ellen I have,
I don't give two shits about.

273
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:32,590
But the guy did it right.
Like he was good with that audience.

274
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,101
Right.
You know,

275
00:12:33,101 --> 00:12:37,090
he said the little funny jokes and he
was real and then I saw some other guy

276
00:12:37,091 --> 00:12:38,680
go on and he's like,
well,

277
00:12:38,681 --> 00:12:43,681
this is one of my first interviews I've
given on empire.

278
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:45,850
I was like,
I don't watch empire,

279
00:12:45,851 --> 00:12:49,450
and
the sad clown in the audience.

280
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,660
He had prepped whatever it was he was
going to say,

281
00:12:52,661 --> 00:12:55,570
but everything he wanted to say was so
fucking lame.

282
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:00,360
You just had to watch.
Her face was just like [inaudible]

283
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:05,750
just struggling,
going through the whole thing.

284
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:06,470
It was like,
God,

285
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:08,600
God,
that's the worst part about those shows

286
00:13:08,601 --> 00:13:11,750
and the best part about doing a podcast.
Like I only have people on that I want

287
00:13:11,751 --> 00:13:13,550
to have on.
So it's all up to me.

288
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:15,320
I decide like,
hey,

289
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,430
maybe Jenny Johnson,
hi,

290
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,990
five.
Be Awesome to have on a podcast.

291
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:20,810
Boom.
And then those people,

292
00:13:20,811 --> 00:13:24,980
they have to get like,
people that are on radio shows or radio

293
00:13:24,981 --> 00:13:27,710
shows.
Don't ever interview radio show people.

294
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,050
I think I made that up other than Howard
Stern.

295
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:32,900
What radio guy ever gets interviewed?
Uh,

296
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:33,763
no,
no,

297
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,930
I was going to say like rush,
but they have to.

298
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,070
They have to interview people.
They don't really give a fuck about.

299
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,520
It's like CNN or whoever it is that they
work for.

300
00:13:40,521 --> 00:13:43,220
Sets it up.
One of my favorite ones was when Chelsea

301
00:13:43,221 --> 00:13:46,040
handler was on with a fuckhead.
What's his name?

302
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:46,963
The English dude.

303
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,410
That doesn't work there anymore.
Oh yeah.

304
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,150
Oh God.
Ugh.

305
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,480
Fucking tool.
He's so gross,

306
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:59,090
but I don't know.
Maybe he's a nice guy.

307
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,790
Maybe we stop saying that he's gross on
on a show.

308
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,340
I'm not a fan of the shitty says to you.
I'm like,

309
00:14:04,341 --> 00:14:05,174
yeah,
yeah,

310
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:07,460
yeah.
Well we go back from a tabloid

311
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:11,900
environment living work for like the sun
or one of those companies that got

312
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:15,830
caught,
but tapping into voicemails of people

313
00:14:15,831 --> 00:14:20,300
that had died and the family got upset
because they thought that the person was

314
00:14:20,301 --> 00:14:22,630
still alive because they were checking
their voicemail was actually the

315
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,040
whatever tabloid.
Yeah.

316
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:29,070
Whatever shit person sold their soul to
the devil and Chelsea handler did it and

317
00:14:29,361 --> 00:14:31,850
Chelsea handler gives zero fucks.
She doesn't have any fucks left,

318
00:14:31,851 --> 00:14:32,900
does not care.
She doesn't know.

319
00:14:32,901 --> 00:14:36,620
Fox does not care and she tortured him.
She tortured him because she was like,

320
00:14:36,621 --> 00:14:38,030
no wonder why your show's getting
canceled,

321
00:14:38,031 --> 00:14:39,230
like you're fucking terrible at this.

322
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:41,330
And she like,
she was calling them out like that in

323
00:14:41,331 --> 00:14:44,000
between takes.
He didn't talk to her.

324
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:47,420
He would just start checking his phone,
looking at twitter and really seeing

325
00:14:47,421 --> 00:14:49,750
what people thought about them there.
Oh,

326
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:53,390
it's.
She brutalized him and she's one of

327
00:14:53,391 --> 00:14:54,960
many.
She's one of our,

328
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,980
he just goes into these debates on
armed,

329
00:14:56,981 --> 00:14:59,720
like he went into this debate with Ben
Shapiro,

330
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:03,620
who's this right wing Guy,
a very smart guy,

331
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,840
and like if you're going to debate this
guy,

332
00:15:05,841 --> 00:15:07,430
you got to have your fucking facts in
order.

333
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,100
And he just didn't.
He went into the gun debate with him and

334
00:15:10,101 --> 00:15:15,101
he just destroyed and he called him out
on his outrage peddling that he was

335
00:15:16,011 --> 00:15:18,410
immediately going to like,
you know,

336
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:21,830
in the debate that he was going to
immediately bring up sandy hook and

337
00:15:21,831 --> 00:15:26,120
bring up all these different people and
that the children that died and that he

338
00:15:26,121 --> 00:15:29,000
was going to immediately use that as
like this cry for outrage.

339
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,580
And he called him on it before he could
ever do it.

340
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:35,660
And you could see piers Morgan was like,
he's taken all his weapons away.

341
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:38,690
Hit the end of eight mile.
It's brutal if you ever seen it.

342
00:15:38,691 --> 00:15:40,120
I've never seen him do it.
Oh,

343
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,850
who appears?
Piers Morgan and Ben Shapiro fencing.

344
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:45,020
That one's pretty good.
Yeah,

345
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:45,880
totally.
Okay,

346
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,710
let's watch it.
Pull up a pierce.

347
00:15:48,711 --> 00:15:52,420
Morgan gets destroyed by Ben Shapiro.
I kind of love that though.

348
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:56,590
I like when people are just.
I can't stand all that stupid so.

349
00:15:57,530 --> 00:16:00,410
Well those shows that whole type of
show.

350
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:01,520
It's so.
It's,

351
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,350
it's,
it only exists because you have a

352
00:16:03,351 --> 00:16:03,981
network,
right?

353
00:16:03,981 --> 00:16:07,160
So you have a network which is this
gigantic thing that has had programs on

354
00:16:07,161 --> 00:16:10,370
forever and they have all these
advertisers that they do business with

355
00:16:10,371 --> 00:16:12,170
and they have these commercials.
They're gonna sell.

356
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:17,210
So essentially the show is only,
it's only an advertiser for advertisers.

357
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:20,210
That's what it is.
Like all these interviews and all the

358
00:16:20,211 --> 00:16:23,300
different programs they have,
all they're doing is trying to get you

359
00:16:23,301 --> 00:16:26,060
to lock in long enough so they could
slip an add in.

360
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:29,840
So every 15 minutes I'll slip ads in and
that's what they sell.

361
00:16:29,841 --> 00:16:34,220
What they really sell is ads.
So didn't give a fuck what you want.

362
00:16:34,221 --> 00:16:35,900
It's not personality driven,
it's not.

363
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,960
It's not about establishing something
that's interesting and fascinating.

364
00:16:38,961 --> 00:16:40,310
And Hey,
we're doing good work here.

365
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:42,550
No,
it's just about selling ads like that.

366
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,630
I was a news producer for like almost 12
years where you really were a and

367
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:48,980
Austin,
San Antonio and Houston.

368
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:54,070
Oh Wow.
Texas knows top producing first and then

369
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:56,450
I just wanted to make more money so I
got the news,

370
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,110
but it was still like,
you know,

371
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:02,150
you have to know all that crap.
You have to get your stories.

372
00:17:02,151 --> 00:17:05,590
And here was a watch.
This is pierce Morgan gets owned by but

373
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:08,450
in a video.
So I found like a five minute version.

374
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,293
So

375
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:18,870
in American
TV series

376
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:26,600
American.
So why am I of only on this issue?

377
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:28,390
Because what you do,
and I've seen it,

378
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,740
I've seen it repeatedly.
What you tend to do is you tend to

379
00:17:32,741 --> 00:17:36,630
demonize people who differ from you
politically standing on the grades that

380
00:17:36,631 --> 00:17:38,440
the children will see it.
Not saying they don't seem to care

381
00:17:38,441 --> 00:17:40,690
enough about the decades.
If they cared more about the decades,

382
00:17:40,691 --> 00:17:43,940
they would agree with you on policy.
I think we can have a rational political

383
00:17:43,941 --> 00:17:48,010
conversation about balancing rights and
risks and rewards of all of these

384
00:17:48,011 --> 00:17:50,220
different policies,
but I don't think that what we need to

385
00:17:50,221 --> 00:17:54,120
do is humanize people on the other side
is as being unfeeling about that,

386
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:56,680
about what happened in January.
You accused me of standing up the

387
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:00,010
grades.
I've seen you do it.

388
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,790
Liquors,
like I say,

389
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:03,200
update.
Let me.

390
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:04,890
You can keep saying that,
but you've done it repeatedly.

391
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:09,630
Well what you do and you keep sending
those folks if they disagree with you

392
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:13,080
politically,
then somehow this is a violation of what

393
00:18:13,081 --> 00:18:16,560
happened in Sandy Hook and you get I,
I really like to hear your policy

394
00:18:16,561 --> 00:18:20,730
prescriptions for what we should do
about guns because you respect the

395
00:18:20,731 --> 00:18:23,340
second amendment and you know I brought
this here for you so that you can read

396
00:18:23,341 --> 00:18:24,460
it.
Constitution.

397
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:29,210
I really like for you to explain to me
what you would do about guns that would

398
00:18:29,211 --> 00:18:30,840
have prevented what happened in Sandy
Hook.

399
00:18:30,841 --> 00:18:32,280
If you want to do what you did in the
UK,

400
00:18:32,281 --> 00:18:33,031
right,
which is banned,

401
00:18:33,031 --> 00:18:35,280
virtually all gone.
That is at least a fair argument and we

402
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:38,220
can have a discussion about whether
that's something that we ought to do

403
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:41,610
very clear what I want to do,
which is exactly what Kelly wants to do

404
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,350
it.
Rather than talk about that rather than

405
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:49,040
address your comments to me about the
staffing of the grades of children

406
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:52,960
starting to trust them too long because
he agrees with everything I've been

407
00:18:52,961 --> 00:18:54,360
saying because he thinks the same way.

408
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:57,970
What does that do to talk to someone
else?

409
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,380
I think it was Gabby giffords.
Was it?

410
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:05,560
Yeah.
So he's just now picking a different

411
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:09,530
shooting
total.

412
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:12,040
Now we got him.
He agrees.

413
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:17,530
What was it like doing news work is fun.
If it bleeds,

414
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:18,430
it leads.
Is that true?

415
00:19:18,431 --> 00:19:21,750
Like what are the conversations that
nightcrawler show with nightcrawler

416
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:24,340
movie?
Is that what somebody get burned back at

417
00:19:24,341 --> 00:19:25,720
babies?
We'd have a lead tonight

418
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:31,060
per and a bag of
whatever's new.

419
00:19:31,061 --> 00:19:32,740
Whatever's you know,
when Houston,

420
00:19:32,741 --> 00:19:35,310
you know,
sometimes it'd be an apartment fire

421
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:37,750
southwest Houston,
like it's just whatever's happening.

422
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,510
You know,
it's,

423
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:42,130
it's local news and so,
and in Austin I did more sports which

424
00:19:42,131 --> 00:19:46,960
was more fun and then when I made the
transition to news I was in San Antonio

425
00:19:46,961 --> 00:19:49,690
and in Houston and it's as a producer,
you know,

426
00:19:49,691 --> 00:19:52,010
you write the newscast,
you're writing with the anchor site,

427
00:19:52,011 --> 00:19:54,880
they're talking heads and then you go in
the booth,

428
00:19:54,881 --> 00:19:57,190
you all right,
three,

429
00:19:57,191 --> 00:20:01,420
two and you know,
it was fun for awhile and then I think

430
00:20:01,421 --> 00:20:02,890
it actually got under my skin a little
bit.

431
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:05,470
I was always doing like comedy and stand
up and everything on the side.

432
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:10,740
And then when I realized I could do that
full time instead of news I got out

433
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:15,010
while you were doing the news,
you were still doing stand up around

434
00:20:15,011 --> 00:20:17,950
town.
Was this during the last stop days?

435
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:19,300
A.
Well,

436
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:24,360
Houston and in Austin it was like 2000
to 2004,

437
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:29,450
maybe city.
I opened at cap city one time,

438
00:20:29,451 --> 00:20:34,390
but I did like the ones on sixth street,
like Velveeta room was just learning.

439
00:20:34,391 --> 00:20:37,390
I was just starting out so you know,
it wasn't that great.

440
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:39,610
I wasn't gonna be a headliner at cap
city at that point.

441
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,460
What is it like working with
newscasters?

442
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:44,760
Because they are the most bizarre
television personality.

443
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:48,100
Like there's really nobody that is more
arrogant

444
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,380
than your local newscaster,
you know,

445
00:20:50,381 --> 00:20:55,381
it's not because it's that person that's
been there forever and everyone around

446
00:20:55,511 --> 00:20:57,850
town knows him,
but the moment they cross out of town,

447
00:20:57,851 --> 00:20:59,500
nobody knows who they are.
So they just,

448
00:20:59,501 --> 00:21:03,400
they're very big,
big egos and sometimes they'll try to,

449
00:21:03,401 --> 00:21:05,430
you know,
flex nuts and god isn't ready.

450
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,430
I just sit down old man,
you know,

451
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:10,900
just put the thing on.
Like I would never take shit from them,

452
00:21:10,901 --> 00:21:14,080
but a lot of people would get their
feelings hurt sometimes.

453
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:17,140
Bizarre folks,
because they're in the entertainment.

454
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:19,180
They are,
they're essentially.

455
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,060
Yeah.
What their entertainment is like.

456
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:24,400
They have a voice that's soothing for
the news,

457
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:27,130
right?
There's a way of delivering the news.

458
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,470
It's like the way someone would sing a
song where like it,

459
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:35,040
the melodies sort of like interacts with
your ears and a very pleasant way.

460
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:37,390
And just to go from story to story,
you know,

461
00:21:37,391 --> 00:21:38,980
and you just try to make it more
interesting.

462
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:41,050
So the directors like let's do a two
shot,

463
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,150
right?
It's going to one favorite is when they

464
00:21:43,151 --> 00:21:48,151
do banter in between to fucking stupid.
They really are from weather to from

465
00:21:49,301 --> 00:21:52,830
anchored a whether from news to sports
and it's like.

466
00:21:52,831 --> 00:21:54,970
So it's just like we were saying about
that game yesterday.

467
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I write down exactly like we would just
be in this town.

468
00:22:00,681 --> 00:22:05,681
Purpose says the worst thing ever.
Well certainly interesting in local

469
00:22:07,511 --> 00:22:08,410
news.
Hey,

470
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,850
taking the kids to ballpark this week
and we'll go ahead and let you know what

471
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,471
we're looking at.
Right,

472
00:22:11,471 --> 00:22:11,881
right,
right there.

473
00:22:11,881 --> 00:22:16,020
Brought me to like
make it stop.

474
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:19,270
Did you ever see that one where the girl
she was talking about,

475
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:24,070
she was trying to talk about music and
she used the term Jigaboo.

476
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:29,260
She was like Jigaboo music.
Don't think I've seen them all to.

477
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:32,170
She didn't know.
Was she a reporter?

478
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:33,280
Yes.
Yes.

479
00:22:33,281 --> 00:22:35,830
She was a reporter and she was talking
about something.

480
00:22:35,831 --> 00:22:36,601
She goes,
Oh,

481
00:22:36,601 --> 00:22:38,190
you know,
it's like that Jacob Music.

482
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:41,230
It's like Jigaboo music.
And the person she was talking to was a

483
00:22:41,231 --> 00:22:43,480
fucking black guy and he was like,
oh,

484
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:44,440
it was a black guy,
right?

485
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:46,870
Wasn't it?
Maybe a baby girl,

486
00:22:46,871 --> 00:22:47,441
baby girl?
No,

487
00:22:47,441 --> 00:22:48,274
no,
no.

488
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,040
First of all,
you look deep in her eyes.

489
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:54,370
You see the back of her skull and look
at the dude.

490
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:57,940
Want to take a moment to address a
comment that I made yesterday?

491
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:59,320
Oh,
this is her apology.

492
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:02,830
Apology.
We'll just take a moment.

493
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,040
Have you ever noticed like your local

494
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:15,323
wonderful

495
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:27,500
look at his face?
Look at his face.

496
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,420
And he's like,
I mean,

497
00:23:32,421 --> 00:23:33,800
your family knows,
right Jacob?

498
00:23:33,801 --> 00:23:34,071
Uh,
yeah.

499
00:23:34,071 --> 00:23:34,904
That's fine.
What's called,

500
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,530
which is for.
He's like,

501
00:23:36,531 --> 00:23:38,150
she's got a beautiful voice.
Yes,

502
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:41,520
yes.
Fucking going.

503
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:44,900
You in trouble.
I'm going to smile through this and keep

504
00:23:44,901 --> 00:23:45,840
my.
Wait.

505
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,020
So that commercial break,
when I explained to you

506
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:54,700
what you've just done to our viewers
gighub you jigaboo or we would have I

507
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:58,040
think one of the funnier things,
it shouldn't be funny,

508
00:23:58,041 --> 00:24:03,041
but it was funny is so our reporters out
there live shots so whatever's going on

509
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,690
and they were in a live truck so they
have to feed the video and we'll cut the

510
00:24:08,691 --> 00:24:11,870
video and say what's the end out cue of
that voicemail or yeah,

511
00:24:11,871 --> 00:24:16,100
I mean the votes out or whatever.
So if there was something that was like,

512
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,720
there was a drive by shooting now that's
not funny,

513
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:24,680
but witnesses to things like that.

514
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:29,190
When the camera gets on them,
there was a lady holding her baby that

515
00:24:29,191 --> 00:24:32,210
at coke and the bottle,
she weren't a boys to men tee shirt and

516
00:24:32,211 --> 00:24:36,260
she was like well you know this here
darious and he,

517
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,690
he's so cute and he,
we want him to do modeling.

518
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:41,360
Did you say coke?
Like Coca Cola.

519
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:42,340
Coca Cola,
baby.

520
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,040
Yeah.
You know like that kind of classic.

521
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:48,020
When she gave the baby Coca Cola,
the baby was drinking like a soft drink

522
00:24:48,021 --> 00:24:49,940
out of a bottle at the fucking shit.
No,

523
00:24:49,941 --> 00:24:50,840
I'm not.
This is like,

524
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:51,770
you know,
the projects.

525
00:24:51,771 --> 00:24:54,440
It's like,
do you know how much sugar is in a

526
00:24:54,441 --> 00:24:56,840
fucking coke?
Like think about the size of a baby's

527
00:24:56,841 --> 00:24:57,471
body.
Well,

528
00:24:57,471 --> 00:24:59,350
the baby just had bullets whizzing by,
it said to,

529
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:01,430
through the drive by.
So maybe.

530
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:03,050
Yeah.
I mean it was just.

531
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:06,680
And then the mom just promoting the
baby.

532
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,620
Not talking about the people that were
just gunned down,

533
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:13,810
just like trying to get him a modeling
job because she thought dairies,

534
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:14,820
we keep,
you know,

535
00:25:14,821 --> 00:25:16,910
and he should be on it.
We're going,

536
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:18,790
oh yeah,
no that's not gonna.

537
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:22,610
Make it cut that show.
There was a guy,

538
00:25:22,611 --> 00:25:27,200
a lot of guys like to try out there
rapping skills while you interview them

539
00:25:27,201 --> 00:25:29,780
for like crimes.
Like did you see the drive by,

540
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:34,320
there was this,
this store was broken into and the,

541
00:25:34,321 --> 00:25:35,690
you know,
the clerk was shot,

542
00:25:35,691 --> 00:25:36,230
you know,
oh,

543
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:38,180
here's what this witness here.
What's your name,

544
00:25:38,181 --> 00:25:39,590
sir?
Then because the camera guy,

545
00:25:39,591 --> 00:25:40,281
let's say,
say your name,

546
00:25:40,281 --> 00:25:43,010
spell it so that we can cut it.
We,

547
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:46,130
I mean these don't even make the error,
but it would just be like so,

548
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,031
so,
uh,

549
00:25:47,031 --> 00:25:48,470
okay.
Now tell us what you saw.

550
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,000
Well,
one,

551
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,511
two,
three,

552
00:25:50,511 --> 00:25:52,980
I saw them
wrapping.

553
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,760
You're like,
this is your big break.

554
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:58,670
This is what you chose to like,
this is never going to make the air

555
00:25:58,671 --> 00:26:01,010
dude.
But I guess they think maybe will they

556
00:26:01,011 --> 00:26:02,100
don't know.
They don't know.

557
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:07,690
There's layers and layers in our society
of people that are in the worst possible

558
00:26:07,851 --> 00:26:12,230
scenario and the best possible scenario.
That's one of the worst scenarios we

559
00:26:12,231 --> 00:26:14,870
have available in the United States of
America as the ghetto.

560
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:18,380
A yeah,
you would see it and it was just so

561
00:26:18,381 --> 00:26:19,430
like,
oh my God,

562
00:26:19,431 --> 00:26:21,560
I cannot believe y'all shot this.
And half the time I'm like,

563
00:26:21,561 --> 00:26:23,410
I know the camera was fucking with me.
You know,

564
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,680
like sending that in.
Like,

565
00:26:24,681 --> 00:26:25,970
I think you're gonna like this,
you know,

566
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:29,750
the sound byte.
We just got to get jaded at all.

567
00:26:29,751 --> 00:26:33,170
Seeing like really fucked up shit over.
And I did.

568
00:26:33,171 --> 00:26:35,240
And that started to bother me,
that it didn't,

569
00:26:35,241 --> 00:26:37,370
like I could just see it,
write it,

570
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:41,030
put it in,
and I could remove myself from that

571
00:26:41,031 --> 00:26:42,950
situation,
but then there would just be those times

572
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:44,160
like something really bad

573
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:49,160
happened and it's like it was personal
or it was like we actually had our sky

574
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,480
helicopter crashed and the two people
were killed like our coworkers.

575
00:26:54,481 --> 00:26:57,390
And so that was something that was like,
it was Kinda the first,

576
00:26:57,391 --> 00:27:00,390
like the beginning of the end for me
where I couldn't stop,

577
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:01,740
you know,
I couldn't do it.

578
00:27:01,741 --> 00:27:04,470
I used to do like,
everything felt very personal.

579
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:05,800
Oh Wow.
Yeah.

580
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:07,920
So that was kind of a,
that sucked.

581
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:09,271
But I was,
you know,

582
00:27:09,271 --> 00:27:12,030
I'm glad I did it for as long as I did
and I did well.

583
00:27:12,031 --> 00:27:14,190
But do you talk about it on stage at
all?

584
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,710
Um,
sometimes.

585
00:27:16,711 --> 00:27:20,220
But
I guess sometimes it just depends on the

586
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:22,580
context or whatever's going on.
But sometimes we'll talk about it.

587
00:27:22,581 --> 00:27:25,950
It seems like it'd be right or maybe
write something about it because it

588
00:27:25,951 --> 00:27:30,480
seems like it would be so ripe for
material and just what it's like.

589
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,970
That movie.
It is night stocker,

590
00:27:31,971 --> 00:27:33,210
right?
Xeloda is nightcrawler.

591
00:27:33,211 --> 00:27:35,130
Nightcrawler.
I haven't even seen that one yet,

592
00:27:35,131 --> 00:27:38,550
but I heard it's great.
It's really creepy.

593
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:40,910
Jake Gyllenhaal will.
Will.

594
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,160
He looks wrong.
Shirt and shit.

595
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:44,400
He's all scrawny and creepy looking now.
He's so good.

596
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,010
He's such a good creeper.
Like it's perfect.

597
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,840
It's like maybe it's too good.
Well I just think he's got it off.

598
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,180
He can become.
Not that guy in the but he can become

599
00:27:54,181 --> 00:27:54,850
people.
Yeah.

600
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:57,480
Know.
And he just did such a good job of

601
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:02,340
capturing the sort of sociopathic
personality of someone who would

602
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:06,180
ambulance chaser and I.
Well I think that happens a lot.

603
00:28:06,181 --> 00:28:08,070
I mean people that want to get the
story,

604
00:28:08,071 --> 00:28:12,090
break the story first and you know,
to try to break a story first,

605
00:28:12,091 --> 00:28:13,530
especially if it's something horrible
you,

606
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:15,550
you do feel like when you're done it's
like,

607
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,780
you know,
just trying to call people and trying to

608
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:21,780
dig up shit and you're just wasn't for
me.

609
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:25,710
After awhile I could imagine I have a
friend who's a cop and he's told me that

610
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:29,970
they'll get to a scene and someone who
had been shot and people,

611
00:28:29,971 --> 00:28:30,680
you know.
No,

612
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,970
no one even bats an eye.
They'll,

613
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
they'll start eating donuts,
like literally eating donuts like right

614
00:28:36,001 --> 00:28:38,250
next to the body,
like no one to care for them.

615
00:28:38,251 --> 00:28:39,810
It's work.
It's just a crime scene and start

616
00:28:39,811 --> 00:28:40,890
cracking jokes.
Sure.

617
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:42,051
Yeah.
And,

618
00:28:42,051 --> 00:28:43,020
and that,
you know,

619
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:46,320
I don't want to say like I went there
but I mean sometimes I,

620
00:28:46,321 --> 00:28:48,000
you know,
like we would see a video,

621
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:53,240
the full video before it's been edited.
Then we would edit out the dead per.

622
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,230
And it is weird when you're just doing
that and thinking absolutely nothing of

623
00:28:58,231 --> 00:28:59,880
it.
Just cut that.

624
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:03,600
Is there any pressure to show like more
like the,

625
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:08,090
there's like libel laws that you have to
follow in news like in,

626
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:11,790
you have to know those going into it,
that what you can and can't say what you

627
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:13,890
can and can't show,
you know,

628
00:29:13,891 --> 00:29:16,650
you can't say like you were saying like
allegedly or you know,

629
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,330
there's certain things like that.

630
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:23,330
You can't say it's a fact when it's just
what it has to come from a legit news

631
00:29:23,551 --> 00:29:25,800
source.
So the Associated Press or CNN,

632
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:26,620
you know,
like you,

633
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:29,520
you have to be able to cite the source
that you got the information from.

634
00:29:29,521 --> 00:29:31,290
You can't just say,
my aunt called and said,

635
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:35,010
you know,
this just happened and that's not a

636
00:29:35,011 --> 00:29:37,830
credible.
One of my favorite ones was this a news

637
00:29:37,831 --> 00:29:40,140
report on an arson.
These people,

638
00:29:40,141 --> 00:29:43,330
their house got lit on fire and this
girl is interviewed and she's like,

639
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:45,910
I don't want to name no names,
but uh,

640
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:48,950
it was my cousin because he's been
trying to get with means.

641
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:53,040
And I think he's the one that lit the
house on the what are,

642
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:55,480
had been trying to have sex with me.
Have you seen that Jamie?

643
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,310
Yeah,
pull that one up.

644
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,330
See if.
Well,

645
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:05,830
because we broke up and he's mad about
it because it's so hilarious.

646
00:30:05,831 --> 00:30:08,680
This lady is.
It's just like.

647
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:10,030
Yeah,
that's why she's like,

648
00:30:10,031 --> 00:30:15,031
I don't want to name no names.
Here we go.

649
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:18,450
Dan and amy.
I am Elizabeth Berg and I'm just going

650
00:30:18,451 --> 00:30:21,660
to step out of the way now so you can
take a look at this scene.

651
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:25,410
What is happening right here behind me?
You can see that firefighters are still

652
00:30:25,411 --> 00:30:28,380
working to make sure that this fire is
out.

653
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:32,100
Smoke is still in the hearing and
firefighters are still over here trying

654
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:34,440
to make sure that everything gets under
control.

655
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,720
Barrage here.
That is when a fire is.

656
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:39,050
Heather,
don't me.

657
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:42,450
You woke up around 3:45 and you saw
this.

658
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,313
What happened?

659
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:47,940
I woke up and said beating on the doors.
My neighbors.

660
00:30:47,941 --> 00:30:49,980
I opened up the door.
My neighbors were like,

661
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:50,970
get out,
get out.

662
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:53,430
You know,
so well opened up the door.

663
00:30:53,431 --> 00:30:57,000
I see.
Just blazing from the garage and I woke

664
00:30:57,001 --> 00:30:58,380
him up,
my husband

665
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,760
out as fast.

666
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:06,330
Move the vehicles out of the way and I
had him go back in the house to get our

667
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:07,980
two dogs that we had in there.

668
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,280
When you got outside and you saw what
was happening,

669
00:31:11,281 --> 00:31:13,860
you saw what was going on,
what were your thoughts face in the

670
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,210
background?
My Gosh.

671
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:16,223
Oh my gosh.

672
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:18,180
You know,
I didn't ever think it was going to

673
00:31:18,181 --> 00:31:19,014
happen to us.

674
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,420
Do you know how this buyer story up?

675
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,103
Yes,
I do.

676
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:27,030
It was cousin my cousin and I don't want
to mention no names.

677
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,030
And you said you think your cousin
started this?

678
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,570
Do you know how or why?

679
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:36,790
He's mad because he couldn't.
He can't get with me.

680
00:31:36,791 --> 00:31:39,320
I'm married to my husband and

681
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:41,990
my second cousin.
Marie short?

682
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:43,240
Yeah,
he put it.

683
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,830
He already put him in the hospital once
last month.

684
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:49,000
I figured he's going to do something
else.

685
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:56,140
Should be on cost.
Not on the news for the look at the guy.

686
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,000
How is he not dying?
Laughing?

687
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,770
Well,
he's not very good at his job either.

688
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:03,070
It's kind of clunky.
It's a tough gig.

689
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:06,370
It is a tough Gig,
but that's not a normal reaction to

690
00:32:06,371 --> 00:32:08,920
someone saying that he normally acts was
a what?

691
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:13,720
Your cousin hold up.
I mean he's got to stand there with his

692
00:32:13,721 --> 00:32:17,230
tie and professionally and not smile or
laugh or go.

693
00:32:17,231 --> 00:32:18,490
What the fuck?
Oh,

694
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:19,331
aware.
First of all.

695
00:32:19,331 --> 00:32:23,110
Where's that fucking town?
Where does deliverance burger.

696
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,100
But it's always those Weirdo towns.
I have a friend,

697
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:29,650
she works out here for the local Fox
station.

698
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,480
Lawrence.
Ivana is her name and she had,

699
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:37,380
I love it because she's made the soup
tmz for all of her call called John

700
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:38,721
Boehner.
John Boehner.

701
00:32:38,721 --> 00:32:40,160
And I was like,
everything.

702
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,300
And she's like,
Boehner.

703
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:44,330
It does look like Boehner.
Like if I saw that in a teleprompter,

704
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,253
I would have to.

705
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:47,670
Don't say.
Did you see or what happened with him?

706
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:51,750
He got busted because he,
he's renting an apartment that is owned

707
00:32:51,751 --> 00:32:54,000
by the indoor tanning lobby.

708
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,280
Stop it.
No,

709
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:57,600
no,
no.

710
00:32:57,990 --> 00:32:59,900
It isn't orange phase.
I retweet it.

711
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:01,120
That I retweet it today.

712
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,300
Uh,
it's called Gen briny.

713
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,630
Briny.
How do you say her name?

714
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,050
She tweeted it at me.
Please tell me I retweeted it because

715
00:33:09,051 --> 00:33:14,051
it's so ridiculous.
It's not a new story from 2013,

716
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,790
but yeah.
Really?

717
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:19,650
Yeah.
Well,

718
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:22,340
everybody's always wondered why this
guy's Tan all the time and he's always

719
00:33:22,341 --> 00:33:22,911
said,
no,

720
00:33:22,911 --> 00:33:23,361
no,
no,

721
00:33:23,361 --> 00:33:23,590
no.

722
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:25,240
Yeah,
I mean he looks bright orange and you're

723
00:33:25,241 --> 00:33:28,270
watching the state of the union like
tanning bed lobbyist,

724
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:32,470
indoor tanning.
Look at it as fancy as fuck.

725
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,780
I'm orange.
As long denied.

726
00:33:34,781 --> 00:33:37,810
That is perpetual skin colors.
Result of some of those tailoring.

727
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:42,460
He just spends a lot of time outdoors.
The Ohio Republican is known to say,

728
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,400
but despite his repeated denials,
using tanning beds,

729
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:48,610
Boehner has ties to the industry.
You just said Bonar.

730
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:53,620
It's Bonar b o e h n e R.
It's Bonar.

731
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:57,130
It's Bonar.
You do you get baner out of that?

732
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,670
That's not been.
No,

733
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,990
that's not painters.
Bar that's boner.

734
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:06,070
Not only has he accepted campaign
contributions from a group called the

735
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:10,990
indoor tanning association,
but when actually lives in a DC

736
00:34:10,991 --> 00:34:14,560
apartment owned by a lobbyist for the
American suntanning association.

737
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:16,960
First of all,
how gross is politics?

738
00:34:16,961 --> 00:34:21,490
This fucking guy can live in apartment
owned by a lobbyist

739
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:25,180
for someone who contributes to tanning
association of a.

740
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:28,150
that's a real.
The American suntanning association.

741
00:34:28,151 --> 00:34:30,340
That's a real group.
I did not know that.

742
00:34:30,341 --> 00:34:31,750
That was.
How can that even be a group

743
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:36,880
and how was the only paint?
1,600 bucks a month for rent in DC.

744
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:41,730
DC's fucking expensive.
That guys

745
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:44,200
crooked crooked to.
There's something else going

746
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:47,980
on everywhere.
So politicians.

747
00:34:47,981 --> 00:34:49,930
I hate all politics.
I'm a political atheist.

748
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:51,580
Are you one of them?
Good for you.

749
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:53,750
Let me to end up lying.
I mean,

750
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:55,900
you're banking on somebody.

751
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,870
Wait a minute.
Bernie Sanders.

752
00:34:57,871 --> 00:34:59,820
You think he's lying?
Bernie,

753
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:03,470
I think Brittany needs to run for like a
homeowners association

754
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:08,810
in Boca Raton or something like that.
Bernie,

755
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,250
a nice cold.
The sac,

756
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:16,440
the sac ping pong championships on the
one percent of the CULDESAC.

757
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:20,330
Bernie Sanders is an interesting guy
though.

758
00:35:20,331 --> 00:35:23,720
He's at least getting young people
excited because they're hoping and

759
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:26,750
praying that someone is different and no
one is different but him.

760
00:35:26,751 --> 00:35:30,230
He's the one guy that's coming along,
let's saying trump's different in,

761
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:31,550
in a way,
in a bad way,

762
00:35:31,551 --> 00:35:34,760
but he is.
I actually will say I was backed into a

763
00:35:34,761 --> 00:35:35,910
corner and somebody was like,
well,

764
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,860
say something nice.
I'm glad he's not lying.

765
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:38,070
I

766
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:41,010
believe he believes every single thing
that he's saying.

767
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:43,800
I don't think he has a team of campaign
managers telling them what to say.

768
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:49,580
I'm pretty sure that he just gets up
there and just start spewing crazy.

769
00:35:49,591 --> 00:35:52,560
But he believes that lets it rip.
It's worth a few billion.

770
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:53,161
He's like,
fuck it,

771
00:35:53,161 --> 00:35:54,100
let's roll the shit.
Yeah,

772
00:35:54,101 --> 00:35:54,510
I mean,
I,

773
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:56,820
there's something that's kind of
hilarious about that part,

774
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,710
but other than that,
they're all full of shit.

775
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:03,510
There's a recent bill or a vote that's
going to take place in the UK to try to

776
00:36:03,511 --> 00:36:05,970
ban him from entering the UK for hate
speech.

777
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,650
This is like a serious consideration and
it's going on right now.

778
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,270
He's um,
for uh,

779
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:17,400
the stuff that he said about Muslims,
he just said,

780
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,720
I mean,
at some point you're like,

781
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,300
I think that everybody was kind of on
board at first.

782
00:36:21,301 --> 00:36:24,810
Like all the old crazies,
somebody saying what we're all thinking

783
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:29,010
that it's kind of people and then he
just hasn't stopped talking and I think

784
00:36:29,011 --> 00:36:30,800
now they're like,
whoa,

785
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,033
yeah,
yeah,

786
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:35,340
come on buddy,
you crossed we get your back.

787
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:37,750
But now kind of spewing some crazy.
Like I,

788
00:36:37,751 --> 00:36:42,390
I actually think that like all these old
people that like him believe that Muslim

789
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:47,100
is a terrorist organization group.
Like I don't think that they get that.

790
00:36:47,101 --> 00:36:49,530
That's,
that's like they think Al Jazeera,

791
00:36:49,531 --> 00:36:54,531
that's actually a TV channel.
It's not a like the Taliban that Brown

792
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:58,770
Peoples Jihad,
Jihad,

793
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:02,940
Jihad and whatever.
Yeah,

794
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:06,030
well people are terrified of people from
other cultures,

795
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,570
but when you've got all their cultures
that are involved and things like,

796
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,720
you know when Isis.
But when people have to understand is

797
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:16,140
people,
isis is killing more Muslims in there.

798
00:37:16,141 --> 00:37:18,810
Are Anybody,
most of the people that they're killing

799
00:37:18,811 --> 00:37:19,644
or Muslims?
Yeah.

800
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:22,230
Like they know they're just bad.
There's this battle that they're,

801
00:37:22,231 --> 00:37:24,870
they're like they're criminals.
I mean,

802
00:37:24,871 --> 00:37:28,290
it's,
I don't know why this annoys me,

803
00:37:28,291 --> 00:37:30,720
but when I'm watching the news or
reading the news,

804
00:37:30,721 --> 00:37:33,450
which I prefer to read it because it
annoys me,

805
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:35,640
not watch it,
but people will say,

806
00:37:35,641 --> 00:37:37,110
well,
we know we're waiting to find out if

807
00:37:37,111 --> 00:37:40,200
this was a terrorist attack,
like the San Bernandino thing before

808
00:37:40,201 --> 00:37:41,430
they release those names.

809
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,640
Once they released their names,
therefore it became a terrorist attack.

810
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:47,790
Don't you think that like the Sandy Hook
Guy,

811
00:37:47,791 --> 00:37:51,560
that was kind of.
He was terrorizing people,

812
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:55,770
but I like that they have to be a brown
in order to be a terrorist.

813
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:56,880
Well,
that's our new.

814
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:58,770
Isn't that weird though?
Our new enemies,

815
00:37:58,771 --> 00:38:01,890
the war on terror and terror has to be
like.

816
00:38:01,891 --> 00:38:03,720
It's like the Germans.
We have to go up to the Germans and the

817
00:38:03,721 --> 00:38:06,540
Japanese or the terrorists,
the terrorists.

818
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,370
It's country.
But what does tear me,

819
00:38:08,371 --> 00:38:09,950
and it doesn't mean brown people do it
bad.

820
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:12,150
We renamed the country,
you know Japan,

821
00:38:12,151 --> 00:38:15,030
they call themselves the poem.
I don't know if you know what we're

822
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:17,940
going to wait because I remember Pearl
Harbor.

823
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,160
There's all these people that believe
there are in other countries,

824
00:38:20,161 --> 00:38:23,010
but as Americans we get to dictate what
their actual alarms are,

825
00:38:23,011 --> 00:38:24,870
so we're just going to decide to call it
all terror.

826
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:27,450
So these are terrorists.
They live in terror.

827
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:29,810
That's the part of the world called
care.

828
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:33,930
You're not allowed to come over here.
We'll put you in camps like we did the

829
00:38:33,931 --> 00:38:34,764
japs.

830
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,450
That's some dark shit,
man.

831
00:38:37,451 --> 00:38:40,990
So horrible.
I was talking to my mom who lives in

832
00:38:40,991 --> 00:38:43,120
Houston,
conservative Republican and all those

833
00:38:43,121 --> 00:38:45,100
fun things.
So I love poking her at the stick.

834
00:38:45,101 --> 00:38:47,170
It's really funny.
And when she said,

835
00:38:47,171 --> 00:38:49,540
oh,
it was terrorists in San Bernardino,

836
00:38:49,541 --> 00:38:51,040
and I was like,
well,

837
00:38:51,041 --> 00:38:54,310
I mean anybody that did that is a
terrorist.

838
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:56,130
Doesn't matter.
When we find out what their name was,

839
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:58,750
Jenny,
the terrorists are like the really bad

840
00:38:58,751 --> 00:39:02,050
ones
was like,

841
00:39:02,051 --> 00:39:03,070
I begged him.
I don't know.

842
00:39:03,071 --> 00:39:04,540
I think the Sandy Hook,
I was pretty bad.

843
00:39:04,541 --> 00:39:06,160
I got to say,
I don't think he was awesome.

844
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:09,150
The fucking Colorado movie theater guy.
That's a terrorist.

845
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,120
No white guy with the orange hair of the
real bad ones though.

846
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:13,650
He's.
He can print announces.

847
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,620
Yeah,
if you can pronounce his name,

848
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:20,420
just not as bad as the guys that saw he
lumped.

849
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:22,590
That'd be that bad,
bad stuff.

850
00:39:22,591 --> 00:39:23,630
Bad News.
Well,

851
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:27,600
it,
it bugs me when people won't criticize

852
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:30,510
Islamic terrorists or Islamic people
though,

853
00:39:30,511 --> 00:39:33,120
because they are worried about being
Islamophobic.

854
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:36,390
Like Islamophobia is a weird one.
That's a weird one though.

855
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,280
Anything that's a phobic like,
well,

856
00:39:38,281 --> 00:39:41,090
it's the um,
what's the word I'm looking for you?

857
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,660
Like if you're on a watch list or
whatever,

858
00:39:42,661 --> 00:39:43,231
you know,
you're,

859
00:39:43,231 --> 00:39:47,310
I'm drawing a big fucking blank.
What is it called me?

860
00:39:47,311 --> 00:39:48,780
Like,
prejudging somebody here.

861
00:39:48,781 --> 00:39:50,070
I'll just.
Yeah,

862
00:39:50,071 --> 00:39:53,150
there was some prescreening.
Yeah,

863
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:54,810
whatever.
You're making an assumption here.

864
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:55,980
I've stereotype,
you know,

865
00:39:55,981 --> 00:39:56,814
like whatever.
And

866
00:39:58,710 --> 00:39:59,640
that's okay.
Sometimes

867
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:04,560
I don't think it's a bad,
like I heard this couple one time I was

868
00:40:04,561 --> 00:40:08,920
on a flight and this family and they're
completely dressed Muslim,

869
00:40:08,921 --> 00:40:11,850
you know,
the face covered in magazines,

870
00:40:11,851 --> 00:40:13,170
old people just like,
you know,

871
00:40:13,171 --> 00:40:14,790
the Gilligan's island,
old people,

872
00:40:14,791 --> 00:40:15,510
you know,
just,

873
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:20,510
and they're like hitting each other like
this guy.

874
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:21,811
I'm like,
no,

875
00:40:21,811 --> 00:40:24,480
I don't care about those people.
I care about the guys that are going to

876
00:40:24,481 --> 00:40:27,970
come on board with slacks that they've
just bought at Mervyn's or something and

877
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:31,410
will button down.
It's still get creases like no luggage,

878
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,060
you know,
um,

879
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:37,380
if that's who's going to freak me out on
a plane as the ones that just are trying

880
00:40:37,381 --> 00:40:39,220
to fit in fuse,
coming out of their shoe,

881
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:42,630
not the ones that are like fully
standing out with all of it.

882
00:40:42,631 --> 00:40:43,500
Like,
no,

883
00:40:43,501 --> 00:40:45,500
sorry.
I know I,

884
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,160
I,
I will prejudge.

885
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:49,340
Yeah.
Because I'm not going to just go,

886
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:52,020
well,
I don't want to offend anybody so let me

887
00:40:52,021 --> 00:40:53,880
get on this plane at these fucking
creepy people.

888
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,280
Cool.
But what I was getting at is it,

889
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:58,740
it's just weird that people will call
you out on being Islamophobic,

890
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,170
but at the same people will openly mock
Christians.

891
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,093
Sure.
Like,

892
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:05,080
they'll,
they can openly mock scientologists they

893
00:41:05,081 --> 00:41:05,730
should.
But,

894
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:07,620
but if you,
for whatever reason,

895
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:08,920
I guess,
well I guess the,

896
00:41:08,921 --> 00:41:13,650
the legit angle would be obviously
because we're at war.

897
00:41:13,651 --> 00:41:17,220
We were at war with two different
countries and we're still in

898
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,240
Afghanistan,
right?

899
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,750
A lot of troops still in Iraq and more
now than before.

900
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:23,490
Right.
And we just send some new ones over

901
00:41:23,491 --> 00:41:24,324
there,
but.

902
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:29,160
And those people that are involved in
the conflict over there are Islamic or

903
00:41:29,161 --> 00:41:30,410
are Brown.
Right.

904
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:34,130
So I guess it,
it lends the idea

905
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:36,200
that like,
well you shouldn't be Islamophobic,

906
00:41:36,201 --> 00:41:40,820
you shouldn't be critical or prejudice
against Islamic people,

907
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:45,410
but it's just,
it's an ideology like lucky first of

908
00:41:45,411 --> 00:41:47,330
all,
excuse me,

909
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:49,970
any,
any religion is stupid,

910
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:54,440
but they're all dumb.
I was just watching bill burrs stand up

911
00:41:54,441 --> 00:41:57,650
and I was laughing so damn hard about
and talking about scientology and he

912
00:41:57,651 --> 00:41:57,891
goes,
yeah,

913
00:41:57,891 --> 00:41:59,160
it's funny.
I mean you're,

914
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:00,950
God's name is Ron,
you know,

915
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:04,490
get a driver's license and a social
security card.

916
00:42:04,491 --> 00:42:06,440
He's like,
but I found out about it when I was an

917
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:07,310
adult.
When you're a kid,

918
00:42:07,311 --> 00:42:09,030
you don't question it,
you know,

919
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:09,921
grew up Catholic,
right?

920
00:42:09,921 --> 00:42:10,341
He's like,
yeah,

921
00:42:10,341 --> 00:42:11,270
you,
why would you?

922
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:12,500
Sure.
Yeah.

923
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,470
Three days later came back.
Yeah,

924
00:42:13,471 --> 00:42:13,920
here.
Yeah,

925
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,710
yeah,
yeah,

926
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:15,530
yeah,
sure.

927
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:19,400
Like you just believe it and then as you
get older to challenge it or to question

928
00:42:19,401 --> 00:42:21,980
it,
you're an asshole.

929
00:42:21,981 --> 00:42:22,940
You know,
like you just can't,

930
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:24,560
don't,
don't challenge the Bible,

931
00:42:24,561 --> 00:42:25,460
don't it's,
you know,

932
00:42:25,461 --> 00:42:26,294
you can't do that.

933
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:29,210
I think there's a higher power.
I don't think it's that story,

934
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:31,820
but maybe a version of it.
Maybe not.

935
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:34,280
I don't know.
Who knows what it is,

936
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:36,920
but whatever it is,
it's not what l Ron Hubbard wrote.

937
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:40,910
It's not the one guy who wrote the most
books of anybody who ever wrote books,

938
00:42:40,911 --> 00:42:43,950
ever scientology.
He wrote five books,

939
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:45,410
fiction.
He wrote more fiction.

940
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,680
Any person's ever lived.
He really did.

941
00:42:47,681 --> 00:42:49,970
He did have one person that's ever lived
on the planet.

942
00:42:49,971 --> 00:42:53,450
He wrote the most books.
That's incredible that they think that

943
00:42:53,451 --> 00:42:54,470
that city,
right?

944
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:56,710
Fuck load.
Exactly a fuck load.

945
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:58,220
Fuck load.
That's exact number.

946
00:42:58,290 --> 00:42:59,390
Yeah.
That's a lot of books.

947
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,770
That's a good question.
James is gonna.

948
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:01,850
Pull that up.
We're gonna find out,

949
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:04,490
but he didn't know.
He wrote the hold the distinction.

950
00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:09,110
She's the most prolific fiction author
ever in the history of the human race.

951
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:13,760
That's how stupid scientology is.
The guy who made up the most shit ever

952
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:19,200
also told the truth about the fucking
frozen ice cubes filled with Metta

953
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:22,610
volcanoes and volcanic and that's why
you get anxious.

954
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:26,760
You know,
it's a.

955
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,450
it's all so stupid.
Swimming across the board that's made up

956
00:43:29,451 --> 00:43:31,070
stuff.
It's people making things up,

957
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:33,890
but you live and you die and no one
knows what happens when you die.

958
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,690
We'll all find out one day.
Hopefully.

959
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:36,710
Maybe.
Maybe we won't.

960
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,630
Maybe not.
Maybe it will become something that

961
00:43:38,631 --> 00:43:42,500
doesn't think here it is.
Most published works by any author,

962
00:43:42,501 --> 00:43:44,660
number one,
a whole Ron Hubbard.

963
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:49,190
Yeah.
One thousand and 84 books.

964
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:52,550
Jesus Christ.
Did he even fucking do a second draft on

965
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:55,070
he of them?
There's no way,

966
00:43:55,071 --> 00:43:57,890
right?
This books are so bad to.

967
00:43:57,950 --> 00:44:00,380
Have you ever publish them?
I don't know.

968
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:02,960
I don't think so.
I think he published them.

969
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,980
I mean he had been.
He published a lot of them in those.

970
00:44:06,981 --> 00:44:09,700
A scifi magazines.
That was like a,

971
00:44:09,701 --> 00:44:12,170
a big part of what he was doing
originally.

972
00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:14,940
Wiki would get books published in those,
you know,

973
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:17,720
they were like Reader's digest.
Who would have these sipho last one was

974
00:44:17,721 --> 00:44:20,150
published in 2006.
Then he died like the eighties.

975
00:44:21,010 --> 00:44:21,950
Yeah,
they don't.

976
00:44:21,951 --> 00:44:23,090
Well,
I don't think it was the eighties.

977
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:25,310
I think it was like the nineties.
What is it?

978
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:27,770
80 six was.
Well,

979
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:31,040
I'm sure they just found a bunch of shit
that he had laying around.

980
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:34,700
Stay the guy who was probably nuts.
He'll just sat down and just never see

981
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,470
like interviews or.
Do you ever watch those documentaries?

982
00:44:37,471 --> 00:44:38,610
I'm fascinated by it.
I love.

983
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,230
Well,
I'll watch any documentary.

984
00:44:40,231 --> 00:44:43,320
That's all I ever watch.
But those are particularly fascinating

985
00:44:43,321 --> 00:44:44,820
because he looks crazy.
Oh,

986
00:44:44,821 --> 00:44:45,840
he's crazy as fuck.

987
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:49,530
Lawrence Lawrence Wright wrote a
fantastic book called going clear and

988
00:44:49,531 --> 00:44:51,900
that's what seems to make that or read
that one.

989
00:44:51,901 --> 00:44:52,910
That was good.
You read it to him?

990
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,001
Yeah.
It's amazing.

991
00:44:54,001 --> 00:44:56,040
Like when you hear about how nutty he
was,

992
00:44:56,730 --> 00:45:01,730
like he was beyond crazy,
but it's one of those are usually people

993
00:45:01,861 --> 00:45:05,370
that end up getting like a leader of
something.

994
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:07,830
They're always,
they're smart but crazy.

995
00:45:07,831 --> 00:45:10,530
You know?
It's like a psychotic brilliance that

996
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:14,370
you can manage to get that many people
on board.

997
00:45:14,371 --> 00:45:16,200
I mean,
they all dress like sea captains and

998
00:45:16,201 --> 00:45:18,530
she's like,
yeah,

999
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:21,240
I'm like you,
you have a lot of metals dude,

1000
00:45:21,241 --> 00:45:25,580
and you have been highly decorated
officer in what?

1001
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:27,720
Like,
well how about when Tom Cruz won that

1002
00:45:27,721 --> 00:45:29,520
gold medal for being awesome?
Holy Shit.

1003
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:35,320
You fucking sit there and they were so
like tense.

1004
00:45:35,321 --> 00:45:37,410
Then you know both of those guys that
are about five foot one,

1005
00:45:37,411 --> 00:45:40,290
five foot two.
Holy Shit that made me laugh.

1006
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,910
LRH lrh.
Yeah.

1007
00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:45,840
They salute to l Ron Hubbard,
the LRH.

1008
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:51,150
This photo of them,
they'd salute the photo like it's

1009
00:45:51,151 --> 00:45:54,570
fucking like it's the flag.
Just thinking like one of your friends.

1010
00:45:54,571 --> 00:45:57,240
It's like real silly and Goofy,
like one of your craziest friends.

1011
00:45:57,241 --> 00:46:00,690
And then imagine his face or her face up
there and everyone just to.

1012
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,930
Just to Andy Dick,
everybody.

1013
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:08,690
There's a room full of people that give
money to.

1014
00:46:10,190 --> 00:46:11,550
That's.
It could be that.

1015
00:46:11,551 --> 00:46:13,170
It's not that much different.
No,

1016
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:14,100
no,
it's not.

1017
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:14,933
No,
it's not.

1018
00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:18,630
I mean he is working with the size of
the fucking metal mean.

1019
00:46:18,870 --> 00:46:20,650
That shit makes flavor.
Flave look,

1020
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:23,940
he saluted him.
He looks over and solutes and everybody

1021
00:46:23,941 --> 00:46:24,960
claps.
First of all,

1022
00:46:24,961 --> 00:46:29,961
look how beautiful that set is that
David Miscavige,

1023
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:34,380
whatever that guy's.
She's just crisis genius.

1024
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:38,150
That metal that he's wearing his whole
neck.

1025
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:42,780
Some crazy,
some crazy cytology stuff.

1026
00:46:42,781 --> 00:46:47,781
That's the day with a youtube video.
It's fucking wonderful.

1027
00:46:48,121 --> 00:46:51,420
They're wonderful.
And there's a great one that a doc on

1028
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:53,910
you can watch on youtube.
It's like scientology in me.

1029
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:55,020
I think it was,
um,

1030
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:56,580
it was,
it was from the BBC,

1031
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:59,340
but it's really good.
It's this guy just track him down and

1032
00:46:59,341 --> 00:47:00,870
getting them.
It's a good one.

1033
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:04,350
It's all clean water in clearwater,
Florida.

1034
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:05,263
Yeah.
He was in,

1035
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:09,690
but there was a summit was in London,
like their headquarters in London,

1036
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:11,690
so it was pretty different when I'm
thinking.

1037
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:13,530
I did see that one.
The clearwater one.

1038
00:47:13,531 --> 00:47:15,240
Yeah.
Well that's where the org people,

1039
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:17,730
my family used to live there.
My Mom and my dad,

1040
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:20,340
they lived in clearwater.
My sister still lives in Tampa.

1041
00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:23,310
There's still still down there.
Is that where you're from?

1042
00:47:23,370 --> 00:47:24,150
No,
no.

1043
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:26,160
They moved there to escape the Boston
winters.

1044
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:32,650
Now they're just trapped and trapped in
a sea of stupid.

1045
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,720
A lot of Nice people down there,
but you know what?

1046
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:39,430
I was just there in Tampa this past
weekend.

1047
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:42,760
You know what it is?
It's all people from the northeast that

1048
00:47:42,761 --> 00:47:45,520
escaped.
That's all my whole show was like New

1049
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:46,241
Yorkers,
Boston people,

1050
00:47:46,241 --> 00:47:49,420
Jersey people were tired.
People just get out of their fucking get

1051
00:47:49,421 --> 00:47:51,160
a job down there.
Fuck winter.

1052
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:53,140
They just say fuck winter,
and they'd go to Florida.

1053
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:56,050
I would do the same thing,
but I grew up in south Texas,

1054
00:47:56,051 --> 00:47:58,150
so like an admin.
It's 50 degrees out here and I'm like,

1055
00:47:58,151 --> 00:47:59,530
hey,
it's freezing.

1056
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:02,020
I'm such A.
I couldn't deal with.

1057
00:48:02,021 --> 00:48:04,160
It will sound like Texas.
Like I dunno.

1058
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:08,920
I love Houston spots.
It's got is it's got character.

1059
00:48:08,921 --> 00:48:11,110
If you're downtown and there's a lot to
do.

1060
00:48:11,111 --> 00:48:12,100
There's,
there's a,

1061
00:48:12,101 --> 00:48:13,600
there's a life down there,
you know that.

1062
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:15,070
But then there are certain places that.
Yeah,

1063
00:48:15,130 --> 00:48:15,960
no,
it's not that fun.

1064
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:17,410
Well,
I remember when I was in Boston,

1065
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:20,980
there was essentially,
there was four big comedy scenes that

1066
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:22,990
we'd heard about.
There was the Boston scene,

1067
00:48:22,991 --> 00:48:24,970
there was the New York scene,
there was a,

1068
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:28,570
the La scene is kind of a San Francisco
seem a little bit,

1069
00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:32,050
but there was a Houston scene and the
Houston scene was because of Kennison

1070
00:48:32,051 --> 00:48:37,030
and Hicks Hicks.
That's where he was such a fan of his.

1071
00:48:37,031 --> 00:48:39,780
But like now they just have the Improv.
Like I,

1072
00:48:39,781 --> 00:48:44,350
I did a show at the Improv over
Christmas break and it's awesome.

1073
00:48:44,351 --> 00:48:46,780
It's fucking huge too.
It's a great venue,

1074
00:48:46,781 --> 00:48:49,210
but it's kind of in a weird part of town
and.

1075
00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:50,560
Yeah.
And it's just,

1076
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:52,630
you mean black?
No,

1077
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:56,210
it's out.
It's not really,

1078
00:48:56,211 --> 00:48:59,770
it's not a black part of town.
They only seem to book a lot of black

1079
00:48:59,771 --> 00:49:00,590
comedians.

1080
00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:01,990
Oh,
but no,

1081
00:49:01,991 --> 00:49:05,260
it's just off of the interstate.
It's an exit,

1082
00:49:05,261 --> 00:49:07,420
you know it.
It's just a weird part of town.

1083
00:49:07,590 --> 00:49:10,510
Like there's just nothing really around
it.

1084
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:12,430
You're just kind of like hauling ass
down.

1085
00:49:12,431 --> 00:49:14,650
I 10 and then you take an exit and
there's the Improv.

1086
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:18,100
So sad because that place,
the laptop in river oaks,

1087
00:49:18,101 --> 00:49:20,920
that's where I know that was the best.
I did my first CD there.

1088
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:24,520
Oh really?
And Ninety nine was the shit,

1089
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:26,440
it was the best club.
It was set up.

1090
00:49:26,441 --> 00:49:29,170
Perfect.
Now it was like a restaurant and I think

1091
00:49:29,171 --> 00:49:32,380
they're trying to get it where they can
at least open part of it up.

1092
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:35,360
It's still there for comedy.
That's a different uh,

1093
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:36,001
it's,
you know,

1094
00:49:36,001 --> 00:49:37,180
it's a restaurant,
a restaurant,

1095
00:49:37,181 --> 00:49:38,250
bar,
restaurant and that,

1096
00:49:38,290 --> 00:49:39,820
but as the stage still there and
everything.

1097
00:49:39,850 --> 00:49:41,830
No it's not,
but they're trying to,

1098
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:43,300
you know,
like all the comedians are going,

1099
00:49:43,301 --> 00:49:45,220
hey,
give us a parking the.

1100
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,420
Because there are a lot of good
comedians and he just,

1101
00:49:48,670 --> 00:49:50,860
you know,
and he wanted to be able to like do your

1102
00:49:50,861 --> 00:49:54,040
job and then try to do this on the side.
Like that's what I always enjoyed about

1103
00:49:54,041 --> 00:49:55,660
it,
but you know,

1104
00:49:55,661 --> 00:49:59,890
I'd have to go to the Improv or try to
get some stage time or sometimes I would

1105
00:49:59,891 --> 00:50:01,810
open up for my friends that were
musicians.

1106
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:04,080
I would just do a set at their,
you know,

1107
00:50:04,930 --> 00:50:07,360
so at least I could get.
I could get stage time,

1108
00:50:07,361 --> 00:50:09,400
you know,
it's tough though.

1109
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:11,650
Oh yeah.
So non ideal.

1110
00:50:12,370 --> 00:50:13,001
But I think,
you know,

1111
00:50:13,001 --> 00:50:15,760
it helped that I already had a job so I
didn't care as much.

1112
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:16,601
Right.
You know,

1113
00:50:16,601 --> 00:50:19,720
like if I was depending on that as my
livelihood,

1114
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:21,450
maybe I would have been more nervous.
But it was like,

1115
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:21,850
yeah,
fine,

1116
00:50:21,850 --> 00:50:24,580
I'm going to have to work tomorrow is
one of the more frustrating things for a

1117
00:50:24,581 --> 00:50:25,360
young comedian.

1118
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:27,200
There's,
they're starting out is to grow up a

1119
00:50:27,201 --> 00:50:30,710
town that doesn't have a scene play now
if you're in Cleveland or something like

1120
00:50:30,711 --> 00:50:31,860
that.
I don't know if Cleveland as a scene,

1121
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:36,020
but it's fucking hard.
And these clubs like the Improv are

1122
00:50:36,021 --> 00:50:38,630
amazing to work out if you are
professional.

1123
00:50:38,930 --> 00:50:40,910
But yeah,
like I've done,

1124
00:50:41,890 --> 00:50:44,150
you know,
a couple of shows at the Improv here,

1125
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:49,040
but it's only because maybe somebody
asked and they had to pull strings

1126
00:50:49,041 --> 00:50:50,960
because I'm not a name for a marquee,
you know,

1127
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:53,810
and you.
And for the Improv you have to be like

1128
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:58,310
trying to get on at the store or the
laugh factory.

1129
00:50:58,311 --> 00:51:00,890
And on like a Saturday night,
they're not going to just go,

1130
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:03,860
hey yeah,
go do seven minutes.

1131
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:05,840
Well,
they've sort of boxed themselves into

1132
00:51:05,841 --> 00:51:10,841
this whole though because you're the
only will they have these rooms that are

1133
00:51:11,001 --> 00:51:15,140
like 500 seats so they can't have open
mic nights because they can't keep the

1134
00:51:15,141 --> 00:51:17,930
room open because they can't eat all the
staff and everything.

1135
00:51:17,930 --> 00:51:19,550
It'll cost them too much money.
Yeah.

1136
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:22,610
And as soon as you don't have open mic
nights then you're not developing new

1137
00:51:22,611 --> 00:51:24,140
talent.
As soon as you're not developing new

1138
00:51:24,141 --> 00:51:28,670
talent then you have to get all your ax
in from out of town and it just,

1139
00:51:28,730 --> 00:51:32,300
it kills the whole art form.
Like you have to have a place to start,

1140
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:34,850
you know,
there's no one place where everybody

1141
00:51:34,851 --> 00:51:35,810
starts.
You can't say,

1142
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:38,180
oh well they have open mic nights in La,
don't worry about it.

1143
00:51:38,350 --> 00:51:40,240
We'll start out in la.
No,

1144
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:42,750
I mean when I came out here and I
started doing just.

1145
00:51:42,830 --> 00:51:44,510
I mean I'm,
I'm doing more writing,

1146
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:46,760
but I still like doing,
I like trying to do stand up,

1147
00:51:46,761 --> 00:51:47,210
you know,
two,

1148
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:49,580
three nights a week or something.
But it's hard to even get that

1149
00:51:49,581 --> 00:51:50,930
sometimes.
Like the laugh factory.

1150
00:51:50,931 --> 00:51:51,830
They're good to me over there.

1151
00:51:51,830 --> 00:51:53,320
And they'll give me a,
you know,

1152
00:51:53,330 --> 00:51:53,961
Monday,
Tuesday,

1153
00:51:53,961 --> 00:51:54,820
Wednesday,
you know,

1154
00:51:54,910 --> 00:51:58,280
one of those nights,
a flappers comedy in Burbank.

1155
00:51:58,310 --> 00:52:00,080
That's a great plot.
Great Club.

1156
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:02,450
I've done.
Have you done the ha ha in North

1157
00:52:02,450 --> 00:52:03,530
Hollywood?
I have done that.

1158
00:52:03,531 --> 00:52:05,620
New One is fucking awesome.
It is awesome.

1159
00:52:05,630 --> 00:52:07,250
It's amazing.
It's perfect.

1160
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:08,121
So I,
you know,

1161
00:52:08,121 --> 00:52:10,460
it's like,
but I have to find everything myself.

1162
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:12,320
I don't rely on like my agent to do
that.

1163
00:52:12,410 --> 00:52:14,140
Like it's just,
you know,

1164
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:16,350
I just want to get it sometime.
I still do that.

1165
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:20,330
I just find everything myself to day.
You find that because I like sitting

1166
00:52:20,331 --> 00:52:22,630
there talking to him.
I'm like well you're not getting like I

1167
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:26,300
get everything going to me shit.
So I'll just keep doing what I'm doing.

1168
00:52:26,301 --> 00:52:28,490
And especially like little clubs in
town.

1169
00:52:28,491 --> 00:52:29,780
I mean,
I mean all my bookings,

1170
00:52:29,781 --> 00:52:31,310
like if I do theaters and stuff like
that,

1171
00:52:31,311 --> 00:52:32,510
my agents do all that stuff.

1172
00:52:32,510 --> 00:52:35,390
But like if I do local spots around
town,

1173
00:52:35,450 --> 00:52:37,280
I have to fight.
Like Joey deals will call me up.

1174
00:52:37,281 --> 00:52:40,850
Listen to dog.
You got to do the fucking hot Hollywood.

1175
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:42,350
He'll be taking bong,
his voice,

1176
00:52:42,351 --> 00:52:43,640
talking to you and the other girl.
Right.

1177
00:52:43,810 --> 00:52:46,550
And like we tell each other,
like comics will tell each other like

1178
00:52:46,551 --> 00:52:50,660
this is placing on Sundays in Santa
Monica that Neal Brennan has is supposed

1179
00:52:50,661 --> 00:52:51,471
to be awesome.
Yeah,

1180
00:52:51,471 --> 00:52:53,240
I keep seeing that on his,
uh,

1181
00:52:53,390 --> 00:52:55,550
he's promoting it west side comedy
theater.

1182
00:52:55,551 --> 00:52:57,260
I think it's called.
I haven't been there yet,

1183
00:52:57,261 --> 00:52:59,930
but I hear nothing but great things.
So that's what you hear,

1184
00:52:59,931 --> 00:53:01,580
you know,
you hear about cool spots.

1185
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,820
Like I did the um,
the laugh factory in Long Beach than

1186
00:53:05,821 --> 00:53:06,654
that.
Um,

1187
00:53:06,790 --> 00:53:09,670
I heard that.
It's a great spot.

1188
00:53:09,671 --> 00:53:11,300
It's a great spot.
It's a great spot.

1189
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:15,620
But the new ones also everything is
because of like just me,

1190
00:53:15,621 --> 00:53:17,630
like either hounding people or just a
friend

1191
00:53:19,490 --> 00:53:20,120
helping me out.

1192
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:20,361
Like,
Hey,

1193
00:53:20,361 --> 00:53:25,350
do you want to open for me when I'm in
Long Beach or well this is an amazing

1194
00:53:25,351 --> 00:53:26,690
place.
If you're in La,

1195
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:29,550
this is amazing place to work because
you really never have to leave.

1196
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:31,860
You can work in just drive,
you know,

1197
00:53:31,861 --> 00:53:33,930
you can drive to Irvine,
drived Ontario,

1198
00:53:33,931 --> 00:53:35,910
you drive to break if you want to get
crazy,

1199
00:53:35,911 --> 00:53:37,620
you go to San Diego,
you know,

1200
00:53:37,621 --> 00:53:39,300
there's so many places to work around
here.

1201
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:44,220
It's actually really pretty cool
considering like I moved here from

1202
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:45,470
Houston,
you know,

1203
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:47,730
it's just,
there's just no scene.

1204
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:51,620
It just wasn't there.
It didn't exist so used to.

1205
00:53:51,630 --> 00:53:54,270
I'm telling you,
that used to be one of the best places.

1206
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:59,600
When I first got there,
I first got to Houston in like 96 or 97,

1207
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,280
somewhere around there,
maybe 90,

1208
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:04,470
maybe 98 either way.
Um,

1209
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:07,140
when I first got there I was like,
Holy Shit.

1210
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:10,740
They had an open mic night that would
start at like eight and go till 2:00 in

1211
00:54:10,741 --> 00:54:11,490
the morning.
Yeah.

1212
00:54:11,490 --> 00:54:14,560
And the open mic night was in the bar
area where they had a small stage and

1213
00:54:14,561 --> 00:54:16,770
then they had the main stage with a main
room was,

1214
00:54:16,771 --> 00:54:19,800
which was fucking perfect.
It was the perfect setup and they had

1215
00:54:19,801 --> 00:54:24,240
all these really creative young local
comedians and they didn't have any

1216
00:54:24,241 --> 00:54:26,030
tolerance for hacks.
I was like,

1217
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:28,080
this is just like Boston,
but like hot,

1218
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:32,370
like hot weather,
but nobody can put their finger on why

1219
00:54:32,371 --> 00:54:35,640
it stopped because the club went under.
It's that easy to throw water on a fire

1220
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:38,880
if they don't have anywhere to perform
and if there's no one seen like,

1221
00:54:38,890 --> 00:54:41,580
like somebody than try to take it.
Like I just felt like there would be

1222
00:54:41,581 --> 00:54:44,250
somebody that would make more of an
effort to try to get it right,

1223
00:54:44,251 --> 00:54:47,070
but who do it like?
I don't know.

1224
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:50,610
I always thought that there would be
somebody that would try to bring it back

1225
00:54:50,611 --> 00:54:51,241
up again.
But.

1226
00:54:51,241 --> 00:54:53,730
Well they tried.
But you need like real resources.

1227
00:54:53,731 --> 00:54:56,040
You need a club,
you need a liquor license,

1228
00:54:56,041 --> 00:54:56,880
you need a,
you know,

1229
00:54:56,881 --> 00:54:59,360
you need the whole thing.
I mean they're idiots.

1230
00:54:59,370 --> 00:55:01,890
Can open bars.
How many bar owners do you know?

1231
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,470
I don't know any idiots that owned bars.
Do you know it?

1232
00:55:04,471 --> 00:55:08,940
Idiots it on bars really a lot.
Really Talk to those idiots.

1233
00:55:08,941 --> 00:55:09,900
Tell him to put a stage up.

1234
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:13,500
I don't know.
It's fucking.

1235
00:55:13,650 --> 00:55:15,390
It's not like anything else.
Like if you,

1236
00:55:15,450 --> 00:55:18,780
if you want to.
I guess being a musician was probably

1237
00:55:18,781 --> 00:55:21,530
just as difficult,
like how does that mean?

1238
00:55:21,830 --> 00:55:23,220
I mean,
I guess you can kind of make your own

1239
00:55:23,221 --> 00:55:25,430
mix tape and shit alone.
You don't need.

1240
00:55:25,770 --> 00:55:28,710
You don't need an audience to practice.
That's the difference between comedy and

1241
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:32,070
other art forms.
You need an audience to practice to know

1242
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:32,851
that.
Well,

1243
00:55:32,851 --> 00:55:34,500
that's one thing that I always enjoyed
about twitter.

1244
00:55:34,501 --> 00:55:37,620
You can kind of tell if something a joke
works or doesn't work on twitter by

1245
00:55:37,621 --> 00:55:38,820
people liking it.
Oh yeah,

1246
00:55:38,821 --> 00:55:39,720
definitely.
Now it's like,

1247
00:55:39,721 --> 00:55:40,650
okay,
that works,

1248
00:55:40,651 --> 00:55:44,640
so let me try it verbally.
You have a big following on twitter just

1249
00:55:44,641 --> 00:55:46,250
from being funny.
You know,

1250
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:48,480
Bert Chrysler and I were talking about
you one day,

1251
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:50,890
the podcast.
Why I say that message?

1252
00:55:50,891 --> 00:55:53,830
It was all my friends were like sending
me the link to it and like,

1253
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:54,750
oh sweet.

1254
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:56,960
Thanks.
Well that's a cool thing about twitter

1255
00:55:56,980 --> 00:55:59,940
is it's like there's a girl.
She calls herself slash lien.

1256
00:56:00,030 --> 00:56:00,751
God,
I love her.

1257
00:56:00,751 --> 00:56:03,540
She's hilarious.
She's up in Toronto.

1258
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:06,480
It's the same thing.
She developed this giant following just

1259
00:56:06,481 --> 00:56:10,230
from being funny and I think that like
people like her myself,

1260
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:15,260
I'm like Rob Delaney,
we all kind of jumped in at the exact

1261
00:56:15,331 --> 00:56:18,810
same time and I think,
I don't think that's possible now for

1262
00:56:18,811 --> 00:56:21,900
somebody.
I think there's too many people that

1263
00:56:21,901 --> 00:56:23,350
people always say that,
but it's like,

1264
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:26,500
I don't want to start a podcast now.
Everybody's got a podcast,

1265
00:56:26,530 --> 00:56:26,950
but what,
how,

1266
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:28,780
how about those guys?
We fucked girls.

1267
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:31,300
Those girls that have that podcast
called guys we fucked.

1268
00:56:31,710 --> 00:56:33,400
I'd never heard of him.
He never heard of it.

1269
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:36,580
It's like top 10 always,
and then it's only been around for like

1270
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:38,180
a year.
They just have a really good podcast,

1271
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:41,410
developed as big as following and then
shot up through the rankings,

1272
00:56:41,411 --> 00:56:41,920
like quit.

1273
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,720
I don't think that podcasts I don't
like.

1274
00:56:43,721 --> 00:56:45,370
I'm,
I think that yeah,

1275
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:48,130
a lot of people have them,
but I still would encourage people to

1276
00:56:48,131 --> 00:56:49,780
try.
But with twitter,

1277
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:51,690
the only thing is,
you know,

1278
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:54,340
it's just,
it was so new and different and

1279
00:56:54,341 --> 00:56:55,350
everyone's like,
who is that per,

1280
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:57,730
you know it,
it was so new and exciting and now

1281
00:56:57,731 --> 00:57:00,490
there's all this other crap either
there's too many things,

1282
00:57:00,491 --> 00:57:01,690
periscope,
snapchat,

1283
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:04,960
all the other,
all these other social media things and

1284
00:57:04,961 --> 00:57:09,961
at the time it was just like facebook
and twitter and I was at twitter doesn't

1285
00:57:10,170 --> 00:57:11,800
do it,
doesn't grow like it used to.

1286
00:57:12,510 --> 00:57:15,100
The amount of people that you get,
like people don't like you.

1287
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:18,910
Some people used to get like massive
amounts of new followers like really

1288
00:57:18,911 --> 00:57:20,680
quickly.
But it's hard to do that now.

1289
00:57:20,710 --> 00:57:23,940
I think also like if you look at someone
and you look to see like,

1290
00:57:24,070 --> 00:57:25,480
like how many people do you follow?

1291
00:57:26,050 --> 00:57:30,960
I follow a lot of people and you read
every single shit.

1292
00:57:30,970 --> 00:57:33,190
I'm retarded.
I got something wrong with me.

1293
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:38,220
I scan twitter constantly for
interesting stories and if someone

1294
00:57:38,471 --> 00:57:39,990
posts,
I'll look through their feed.

1295
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:40,920
They post two,
three,

1296
00:57:40,930 --> 00:57:42,580
four interesting stories in a row and
boom,

1297
00:57:42,581 --> 00:57:43,720
I follow him.
I'm like,

1298
00:57:43,721 --> 00:57:45,060
you never know.
But how do you find them?

1299
00:57:45,061 --> 00:57:46,690
Just through somebody retreating number
or something.

1300
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:48,760
Most of it is because they tweet things
to me.

1301
00:57:49,330 --> 00:57:50,380
That's a lot.
Okay.

1302
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:53,250
So someone will tweet something really
cool to me and uh,

1303
00:57:53,251 --> 00:57:56,410
I retweet it.
Like what I've started doing,

1304
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:59,920
I started doing a long time ago is when
people send me cool stuff,

1305
00:57:59,950 --> 00:58:04,330
I retweet it because it gives people an
incentive to send you more cool stuff

1306
00:58:04,331 --> 00:58:04,961
and they go,
hey,

1307
00:58:04,961 --> 00:58:06,040
retweeted me.
It's fine.

1308
00:58:06,070 --> 00:58:10,330
It's cool.
And like when I find their page,

1309
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:13,600
like if someone retweets something or if
I retweet something someone sent me and

1310
00:58:13,601 --> 00:58:15,700
I find their page and they have a bunch
of cool shit on there,

1311
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:16,900
I'll start following them.

1312
00:58:17,290 --> 00:58:22,290
And I think that just that way you
ensure that you have like sort of a

1313
00:58:22,421 --> 00:58:26,380
network of people that are distributing
interesting information,

1314
00:58:26,381 --> 00:58:27,770
sending it your way,
but he's a link.

1315
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:31,210
Is it links to things?
Sometimes it's links to things that are.

1316
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:33,660
Sometimes it's just a funny not apply to
you.

1317
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:35,710
Oh yeah.
Sometimes it's funny reply sometimes.

1318
00:58:35,711 --> 00:58:39,700
It's just a funny post now how many
unfunny replies you get from people

1319
00:58:39,701 --> 00:58:41,270
trying to make you laugh.
Yeah.

1320
00:58:41,271 --> 00:58:46,230
You get those that's going to happen.
It's just cluttered and it's just,

1321
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:47,730
Oh god,
sometimes it's so pull.

1322
00:58:47,731 --> 00:58:49,660
Yours is so humor based,
you know,

1323
00:58:49,670 --> 00:58:52,510
you're,
you're almost insulting me.

1324
00:58:52,511 --> 00:58:53,530
And I'm like,
what the fuck?

1325
00:58:53,531 --> 00:58:54,650
And they'll go,
it's getting,

1326
00:58:54,870 --> 00:58:55,960
you know,
like as a joke,

1327
00:58:56,580 --> 00:58:57,670
a joke.
I'm like,

1328
00:58:57,780 --> 00:58:58,990
no,
no,

1329
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:00,453
no,
I can't.

1330
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:03,190
Well you got to think there's a lot of
people that are just trying anything to

1331
00:59:03,191 --> 00:59:04,540
get a reaction from you.

1332
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:08,860
They're standing out there hyping until
we get a signal back.

1333
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:11,570
I mean,
but it's,

1334
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:15,180
it's such an interesting concept that
people like,

1335
00:59:15,580 --> 00:59:18,670
like I did a panel at south by southwest
last year,

1336
00:59:18,671 --> 00:59:19,540
two years ago,
something like that.

1337
00:59:19,541 --> 00:59:20,770
And it was just it.
Yeah.

1338
00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:24,530
And it was just about like getting a
career out of it,

1339
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:27,110
you know,
like how else would anybody have noticed

1340
00:59:27,111 --> 00:59:30,080
me outside of Houston?
Well that's how I noticed you.

1341
00:59:30,081 --> 00:59:31,640
I don't remember when I started noticing
you,

1342
00:59:31,641 --> 00:59:34,220
but I've been following you for.
How long have you been on twitter?

1343
00:59:35,570 --> 00:59:37,820
Since like 2009.
I the thing I've been following you for

1344
00:59:37,821 --> 00:59:40,220
at least two years,
at least two years.

1345
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:45,520
And I don't know how long totally,
but I remember a guy tweeted one of your

1346
00:59:45,771 --> 00:59:48,500
things like to me,
I think someone tweeted something funny

1347
00:59:48,501 --> 00:59:52,400
that you said and I think I retweeted it
and then I started following you.

1348
00:59:52,670 --> 00:59:53,960
That's how I do it.
But it's really.

1349
00:59:53,961 --> 00:59:54,720
Yeah,
it's kind of,

1350
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:57,320
it's word of mouth,
word of word,

1351
00:59:57,350 --> 00:59:58,850
but,
but you could still do that,

1352
00:59:59,090 --> 01:00:00,320
but I do think that's fast.
I,

1353
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:03,050
that's what I love about twitter.
I think it's really fascinating that.

1354
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:07,520
How else would anybody I've ever heard
of me if it wasn't for that particular

1355
01:00:07,521 --> 01:00:10,280
form of social media.
I just think there's too much now.

1356
01:00:10,281 --> 01:00:13,850
There's too many people.
There's too many extra things that I

1357
01:00:13,851 --> 01:00:16,910
don't think people are going to get
noticed that way that I lucked out and

1358
01:00:16,911 --> 01:00:18,230
got out of this.
Well,

1359
01:00:18,231 --> 01:00:21,980
there was that affect like the early
days of my space.

1360
01:00:21,981 --> 01:00:23,720
Do you remember the mindspace effect?
Like Tila,

1361
01:00:23,721 --> 01:00:27,410
Tequila and cook and all these people
got super famous,

1362
01:00:27,411 --> 01:00:29,600
like really quick.
Because once you know,

1363
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:31,910
first of all you followed Tom because
everybody had a fall.

1364
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:32,900
Tom,
from my space,

1365
01:00:33,350 --> 01:00:36,860
what the fuck is Tom Up to these days?
Just hope he's okay.

1366
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:40,490
He's in Belize right now with gold
underwear on and fucking stacks of

1367
01:00:40,491 --> 01:00:43,220
champagne bottles next to him and big
fucking

1368
01:00:44,830 --> 01:00:45,663
bed.

1369
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:49,610
Just bawling.
I mean,

1370
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:51,650
how much money did you make from that?
Fucking stupid.

1371
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:55,610
It made a shit ton of fucking facebook
guy.

1372
01:00:55,670 --> 01:00:56,810
Yeah,
I mean,

1373
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:59,900
yeah,
that guy's made insane amounts of.

1374
01:00:59,901 --> 01:01:01,610
Wow,
that's impressive.

1375
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:03,380
That's bizarre.
That's bizarre money.

1376
01:01:03,381 --> 01:01:07,190
He looks bewildered all the time too.
Like whenever he just woke up from a nap

1377
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:10,220
to me always looks like he's worried
that someone's gonna kidnap.

1378
01:01:10,221 --> 01:01:12,920
I'm constantly.
You got that kind of money,

1379
01:01:12,921 --> 01:01:14,900
like don't you know that he's probably
had those threats.

1380
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:19,400
Threats for sure.
When you're going to be billions of

1381
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:21,830
dollars.
Billions and now he's got a new baby.

1382
01:01:21,831 --> 01:01:23,590
I believe it's him.
His wife just had a baby.

1383
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:26,190
He's Christ,
but he takes pictures of everything is

1384
01:01:26,191 --> 01:01:27,770
why it was baby.
Look at me,

1385
01:01:27,771 --> 01:01:29,840
look at them.
Maybe it's like putting it out there,

1386
01:01:29,870 --> 01:01:31,100
like he's getting the jump.
Like,

1387
01:01:31,101 --> 01:01:31,851
uh,
what's his face?

1388
01:01:31,851 --> 01:01:32,750
Ben Shapiro was.

1389
01:01:32,790 --> 01:01:35,930
I'll put it out there first before.
Well maybe he's just surrounded by

1390
01:01:35,931 --> 01:01:38,960
fucking Spec ops guys just locked and
loaded,

1391
01:01:38,961 --> 01:01:42,470
ready to party.
It's a strange thing like facebook was

1392
01:01:42,471 --> 01:01:45,110
cool at first and then all of a sudden
when I started getting friend requests

1393
01:01:45,111 --> 01:01:46,630
from my mom's friends,
you know,

1394
01:01:46,631 --> 01:01:51,631
like then all of a sudden it was like
something else.

1395
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:54,230
Well,
too many people get real weird online

1396
01:01:54,290 --> 01:01:58,840
and just started just digging into your
stuff and stalking you and look at

1397
01:01:58,880 --> 01:01:59,790
those.
Jenny Golan,

1398
01:01:59,791 --> 01:02:04,070
what she eats here every Tuesday.
It seems like if I go there on Tuesday,

1399
01:02:04,071 --> 01:02:06,950
maybe I'll find one.
I really enjoy your tweets.

1400
01:02:06,951 --> 01:02:10,120
You think he gets on my underwear.
It's like,

1401
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:12,590
I don't know.
The people that think they know you

1402
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:16,790
based on.
I think instagram was more that way.

1403
01:02:16,791 --> 01:02:18,310
Like I have twitter and instagram and
that's it.

1404
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:19,620
I don't have the other things,
but

1405
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:24,290
I would have like I'm gonna take an
instagram picture of you right now that

1406
01:02:24,410 --> 01:02:28,710
people will know that this happened
while we're actually doing the podcast,

1407
01:02:28,711 --> 01:02:30,940
talking about instagram,
so looking at me like

1408
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:33,450
Bam.
Second.

1409
01:02:33,451 --> 01:02:34,530
Put that up.
If people go,

1410
01:02:34,531 --> 01:02:37,260
Hey,
but I've had people like I went to,

1411
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:40,740
like I took a trip,
a road trip with friends to big Sur and

1412
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:45,630
I went to big Sur.
I love big Sur shit up there so one of

1413
01:02:45,631 --> 01:02:46,920
my friends took a picture of me,
you know,

1414
01:02:46,921 --> 01:02:49,830
you get no cell reception and so we're
like on this side of the road,

1415
01:02:49,831 --> 01:02:52,140
I'm holding my phone.
I was like eating an apple and she took

1416
01:02:52,141 --> 01:02:55,890
a picture but it was so beautiful behind
me and I put that on instagram like,

1417
01:02:55,891 --> 01:02:56,820
oh,
I'm in big Sur.

1418
01:02:57,150 --> 01:02:58,440
And then I had these people that are
like,

1419
01:02:58,470 --> 01:03:00,030
you have to stay at Fenton.

1420
01:03:00,070 --> 01:03:01,890
That's where you have to stay and you
need to go eat.

1421
01:03:01,891 --> 01:03:05,100
And I'm like,
do you think I drove from La to big Sur

1422
01:03:05,101 --> 01:03:09,210
without a plan of where I'm going to
stay and what I'm going to do?

1423
01:03:09,211 --> 01:03:10,980
Like they're telling me what I need to
do.

1424
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:12,233
Well,
they're just trying to help.

1425
01:03:12,740 --> 01:03:14,040
No,
it's in a different way.

1426
01:03:14,041 --> 01:03:14,761
It's like,
yeah,

1427
01:03:14,761 --> 01:03:17,160
you need to do this.
You don't know if it's like a deep

1428
01:03:17,161 --> 01:03:21,510
seated like as a kid being told that or
something that it's just so obnoxious to

1429
01:03:21,511 --> 01:03:22,111
me.
Yeah.

1430
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:24,360
It's like I know I have a plan.
Don't worry.

1431
01:03:24,361 --> 01:03:25,590
I'm good.
I'm good.

1432
01:03:25,830 --> 01:03:27,750
You're a bit of a rebel.
I see what's now.

1433
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:32,370
I think I'm probably an asshole.
A bit of an asshole is probably more

1434
01:03:32,371 --> 01:03:34,050
accurate.
I always assume it's.

1435
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:36,360
We have very different reactions to the
same thing.

1436
01:03:36,390 --> 01:03:39,180
I always assume that it's people that
are in town that are trying to help me

1437
01:03:39,181 --> 01:03:40,830
out and steer me towards a good story.

1438
01:03:40,830 --> 01:03:42,450
You look at.
It's like they live in Vermont or

1439
01:03:42,451 --> 01:03:43,380
something.
They're just like,

1440
01:03:43,381 --> 01:03:45,480
they've been there once and telling me
what to do,

1441
01:03:45,510 --> 01:03:47,910
but don't you think that just trying to
steer you in the right direction.

1442
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:48,721
You're like,
fuck you.

1443
01:03:48,721 --> 01:03:49,800
Don't tell me what to do.
Yeah.

1444
01:03:49,801 --> 01:03:50,850
No,
I think they're horrible people.

1445
01:03:52,570 --> 01:03:56,280
I think they're terrorist sympathizers
at the sympathizers,

1446
01:03:56,281 --> 01:03:58,080
yet they're all about isis.
See,

1447
01:03:58,081 --> 01:03:59,940
I always think they're just trying to
help out.

1448
01:03:59,941 --> 01:04:02,190
I think it's cool.
I enjoy it when people do that.

1449
01:04:02,191 --> 01:04:04,860
I even asked for suggestions.
I'll ask for.

1450
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:07,080
That's different now.
I'll ask for suggestions.

1451
01:04:07,081 --> 01:04:07,561
It's just,
Hey,

1452
01:04:07,561 --> 01:04:09,660
I'm in big Sur and then it's like you
need to go eat here,

1453
01:04:09,661 --> 01:04:11,010
you need to stay here,
you know,

1454
01:04:11,011 --> 01:04:12,300
you have to do this,
you need.

1455
01:04:12,930 --> 01:04:13,830
And I'm like,
if you,

1456
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:16,500
if you made it,
worded it in a way that was like,

1457
01:04:16,501 --> 01:04:19,580
I don't know where you're staying,
but I could tell you like I stayed here

1458
01:04:19,581 --> 01:04:21,450
at one time and it was fantastic.

1459
01:04:21,450 --> 01:04:23,150
It was more of like the telling me what
to do.

1460
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:26,220
You think that people say that when
something's awesome like,

1461
01:04:26,230 --> 01:04:27,990
dude,
you need to check this out.

1462
01:04:28,350 --> 01:04:31,890
I find sometimes people do it to let me
know they've been places.

1463
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:34,140
Does that ever happen?
You know what I mean?

1464
01:04:34,141 --> 01:04:36,600
Like it's like kind of um,
Brag.

1465
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:41,010
Almost like a humble brag.
It is like that or a Oh,

1466
01:04:41,011 --> 01:04:41,821
that jacket.
Yeah.

1467
01:04:41,821 --> 01:04:43,980
That.
And then tell me the name of the jacket,

1468
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:46,560
like the brand or whatever.
Like I have that jacket too.

1469
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:50,850
Do you react?
Is it like men telling you to go

1470
01:04:50,851 --> 01:04:52,120
somewhere and do things?
Do you,

1471
01:04:52,470 --> 01:04:53,740
do you need to blow your nose?
Yeah,

1472
01:04:53,750 --> 01:04:55,050
I need to blow my nose,
my allergies.

1473
01:04:55,060 --> 01:04:56,710
My claritin has not kicked in yet.
Um,

1474
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:59,550
what do you have allergies to?
It's usually when it rains,

1475
01:04:59,551 --> 01:05:01,090
whatever it kicks up.
It's like pollen,

1476
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:03,450
ragweed,
like all that shit oil,

1477
01:05:07,470 --> 01:05:09,690
plenty of oil.
But it's not,

1478
01:05:09,691 --> 01:05:13,380
it's not that men actually.
It's typically women that do it.

1479
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:14,273
Brilliant.
Yeah.

1480
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:16,110
Oh No.
Yeah.

1481
01:05:17,290 --> 01:05:20,050
Men Don't really actually bothered me
that much.

1482
01:05:20,110 --> 01:05:23,260
I mean that if somebody will write
something sexual or whatever,

1483
01:05:23,261 --> 01:05:23,711
I'm like,
ah,

1484
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:24,544
thanks.

1485
01:05:26,610 --> 01:05:28,450
It doesn't,
I don't get offended by it.

1486
01:05:28,451 --> 01:05:32,120
It just thinks like gives a shit
I,

1487
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:35,560
but I've see you.
It is funny when you click on that,

1488
01:05:35,620 --> 01:05:37,120
you can click on their page and you'll
see.

1489
01:05:37,130 --> 01:05:38,840
It's like the pictures,
you know,

1490
01:05:38,950 --> 01:05:41,390
the guy and his wife and three little
kids and he's like,

1491
01:05:41,660 --> 01:05:43,560
I want to smell your vagina.
You're like,

1492
01:05:44,470 --> 01:05:46,150
I'm so glad you're married.
And a father.

1493
01:05:46,990 --> 01:05:48,910
I just imagined my dad doing that.
Growing up.

1494
01:05:50,130 --> 01:05:52,380
He would have had instagram.
God,

1495
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:53,550
he wouldn't have.
No,

1496
01:05:53,650 --> 01:05:54,670
no,
not yours.

1497
01:05:54,790 --> 01:05:56,500
Not My dad.
He would probably,

1498
01:05:56,890 --> 01:05:58,890
he would have been more of the,
you know,

1499
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:00,160
like when you're a kid,
you're like,

1500
01:06:00,161 --> 01:06:03,160
you walk in your Dad's watching tv and
it's like there's just tits on the

1501
01:06:03,161 --> 01:06:05,440
screen here.
I'm going to get on there,

1502
01:06:05,441 --> 01:06:09,340
I don't know,
skinemax or whatever these flipping

1503
01:06:09,341 --> 01:06:11,650
through and then I walk in and surprise
him and he,

1504
01:06:12,070 --> 01:06:14,890
oh no,
I was just trying to figure out those

1505
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:15,930
goddamn remote,
like,

1506
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:16,690
fuck,
no,

1507
01:06:16,690 --> 01:06:17,523
I'm not doing that.

1508
01:06:17,690 --> 01:06:19,510
That's what he grew up in a different
era.

1509
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:20,940
If he grew up today,
the,

1510
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:24,730
your era definitely formed you in a way.
I see.

1511
01:06:24,731 --> 01:06:26,650
My parents were like,
my dad and I were like,

1512
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:29,050
well,
40 years younger than my parents.

1513
01:06:29,390 --> 01:06:30,730
My Dad's no longer with us,
but my.

1514
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:32,920
Yeah,
they were just older people that had

1515
01:06:32,921 --> 01:06:34,700
kids later in life.
Well,

1516
01:06:34,750 --> 01:06:36,580
there was still banging it out late in
life.

1517
01:06:36,581 --> 01:06:37,414
That's good.
Yeah.

1518
01:06:37,930 --> 01:06:40,210
They were like married for I think like
15 years before that.

1519
01:06:40,211 --> 01:06:41,560
My sister.
Wow.

1520
01:06:41,650 --> 01:06:44,500
Yeah.
But the downside would be like my sister

1521
01:06:44,501 --> 01:06:44,951
and I'd go,
hey,

1522
01:06:44,951 --> 01:06:47,350
we want to go to California,
go to Disneyland.

1523
01:06:47,351 --> 01:06:48,184
Disney,
you know,

1524
01:06:48,210 --> 01:06:49,780
and I know we've been there a million
times,

1525
01:06:51,470 --> 01:06:52,860
just say all.
No,

1526
01:06:52,890 --> 01:06:57,580
that's makes me sad as a dad
with my kids,

1527
01:06:58,500 --> 01:06:59,700
we always did shit,
but we were.

1528
01:06:59,701 --> 01:07:02,010
We grew up on the water so we had like,
oh yeah,

1529
01:07:02,020 --> 01:07:03,730
we always ended with beach boat,
sailboat.

1530
01:07:03,790 --> 01:07:07,420
We had all the fun stuff.
It's not like we were in the Gulf that

1531
01:07:07,420 --> 01:07:10,680
water
oil spills up that motherfucker

1532
01:07:13,570 --> 01:07:16,960
now probably a lot more.
I don't think there were so many when I

1533
01:07:16,961 --> 01:07:18,340
was a kid.
They weren't digging,

1534
01:07:18,970 --> 01:07:21,460
I'm sure as much.
I don't think so.

1535
01:07:21,790 --> 01:07:26,470
I went to Santa Barbara recently after
the big oil spill in the Gulf.

1536
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:29,680
Whenever I see those fucking things out
in the water,

1537
01:07:29,681 --> 01:07:31,180
I say,
well that's a ticking time bomb.

1538
01:07:31,230 --> 01:07:33,250
Right?
So that's going to fuck up eventually.

1539
01:07:33,460 --> 01:07:36,010
And then this beautiful beach,
it's going to have oil all over it.

1540
01:07:36,850 --> 01:07:38,800
Well the odds of it fucking upper
actually.

1541
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:43,920
I mean you think about how many rigs are
in the water and how many spills there

1542
01:07:44,150 --> 01:07:45,250
have actually been.
It's,

1543
01:07:45,580 --> 01:07:46,450
you know,
it's,

1544
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:50,680
it's not the odds of all of those
things.

1545
01:07:50,681 --> 01:07:53,050
Having a a,
a spill is pretty.

1546
01:07:53,540 --> 01:07:55,660
It's fairly low,
fairly low and it's,

1547
01:07:55,661 --> 01:07:58,690
but it's always like human error.
It's just they're not hiring and it's

1548
01:07:58,691 --> 01:08:01,450
always bp and I always,
I actually think it's always bp.

1549
01:08:01,451 --> 01:08:05,200
They don't hire the right people.
It's not always other companies with the

1550
01:08:05,201 --> 01:08:10,201
last big BP oil spill to cut corners,
like the fact that they cut corners and

1551
01:08:10,390 --> 01:08:12,880
the way they constructed it because they
were behind budget,

1552
01:08:12,881 --> 01:08:15,920
but exactly the amount of they have

1553
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:21,100
versus the amount of accidents that
occur and the devastation that occurs

1554
01:08:21,111 --> 01:08:22,940
because of the accidents.
That's one way of looking at it,

1555
01:08:23,150 --> 01:08:26,660
but the other way of looking at it is
when those accidents do occur,

1556
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:31,430
the fucking catastrophic damage is so
devastating that each one of those

1557
01:08:31,431 --> 01:08:34,730
things is a ticking time bomb.
And how long have they been doing it?

1558
01:08:34,980 --> 01:08:36,950
Well,
they've only been doing those offshore

1559
01:08:36,951 --> 01:08:39,320
oil drills for like 30 or 40 years I
think.

1560
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:42,500
I don't think it's been more than that.
I think it's been.

1561
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:45,500
I think it's just over 40.
I think so.

1562
01:08:45,860 --> 01:08:48,680
So to me,
I look at it like nuclear power.

1563
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:50,930
There's only been a couple of nuclear
accidents,

1564
01:08:51,170 --> 01:08:55,310
but those accidents are a fucking crazy
like Fukushima.

1565
01:08:55,311 --> 01:08:57,440
Everybody's sort of forgotten about it,
but every.

1566
01:08:57,441 --> 01:09:00,980
I still check on the news or on
Fukushima because the mainstream news is

1567
01:09:00,981 --> 01:09:02,750
completely stopped paying attention to
it,

1568
01:09:02,780 --> 01:09:05,600
but if you pay attention to it,
if you go and search out,

1569
01:09:05,930 --> 01:09:07,970
it's off cluster fuck over there.

1570
01:09:07,970 --> 01:09:10,370
It's really bad and it's not getting any
better.

1571
01:09:10,410 --> 01:09:11,600
Like anytime soon.
No,

1572
01:09:12,590 --> 01:09:15,530
I grew up in the town I grew up and
actually had a nuclear power plant.

1573
01:09:15,690 --> 01:09:16,523
Well,
yeah,

1574
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:19,250
and then riggs everywhere.
It was just.

1575
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:21,650
I'm surprised I don't have like a
fucking arm guard out of my head.

1576
01:09:21,770 --> 01:09:26,060
I have a buddy who was a bone cancer
because he grew up next to a golf course

1577
01:09:26,570 --> 01:09:30,340
and really fucking golfing and gives you
a bunk answer.

1578
01:09:30,370 --> 01:09:33,290
No,
the pesticides they would use on the

1579
01:09:33,291 --> 01:09:34,580
golf course.
Keep the weeds down.

1580
01:09:34,630 --> 01:09:38,240
Sure.
Sank into the wells and so they had well

1581
01:09:38,241 --> 01:09:41,000
water.
Everybody on his fucking block.

1582
01:09:41,001 --> 01:09:43,370
Our cancer,
like literally everybody got cancer

1583
01:09:43,570 --> 01:09:45,170
crazy.
Well my dad,

1584
01:09:45,171 --> 01:09:46,670
I mean he.
He died from cancer,

1585
01:09:46,671 --> 01:09:49,340
but he also worked at a chemical plant
for 37 years,

1586
01:09:49,341 --> 01:09:54,341
so now you can't tell me that,
that didn't like play into him getting

1587
01:09:55,010 --> 01:09:55,970
diagnosed with cancer.

1588
01:09:56,350 --> 01:10:00,050
Just smelling chemicals all day long,
like there's just no way.

1589
01:10:00,051 --> 01:10:03,260
And I know all the people that he's
worked with and how many people have

1590
01:10:03,261 --> 01:10:04,040
ended up,
you know,

1591
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:06,600
getting some fucked up kind of cancer.
Oh Man.

1592
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:09,760
Oh terrible.
Do you feel like um,

1593
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:12,530
there's a,
there's a weird thing going on with

1594
01:10:12,740 --> 01:10:14,810
instagram and social media and stuff
like that,

1595
01:10:14,811 --> 01:10:18,290
that there's this new sort of intimacy
that's very difficult to navigate.

1596
01:10:18,550 --> 01:10:21,030
That's what I was saying that people
like sort of contact.

1597
01:10:21,031 --> 01:10:24,380
Do you like they know you or they,
they reach out to you and give you

1598
01:10:24,381 --> 01:10:26,640
suggestions.
Like they know you there.

1599
01:10:26,750 --> 01:10:31,460
There's an intimacy that people have
with people that like them or follow

1600
01:10:31,461 --> 01:10:35,120
them that you didn't have to really
handle 20,

1601
01:10:35,121 --> 01:10:38,050
30 years ago.
People have access to.

1602
01:10:38,260 --> 01:10:40,490
Yes.
You have access to them if you're so

1603
01:10:40,491 --> 01:10:43,820
inclined and you know,
like I'll get people because now like

1604
01:10:43,821 --> 01:10:47,450
with Instagram,
you can direct message on instagram and

1605
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:49,190
twitter,
you know,

1606
01:10:49,190 --> 01:10:50,023
read those though.

1607
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:51,590
Um,
you know,

1608
01:10:51,591 --> 01:10:53,270
I'll see.
Sometimes I'll click and I could see

1609
01:10:53,271 --> 01:10:55,370
what it is and if it's just something
I'm like,

1610
01:10:55,371 --> 01:10:58,670
man,
just I've already seen it or I can't sit

1611
01:10:58,671 --> 01:11:01,490
there and accept everything because then
everybody would keep.

1612
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:02,380
Yes.
You know,

1613
01:11:02,380 --> 01:11:03,850
sending things.
Um,

1614
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:09,170
how many instagram followers to like
57,000.

1615
01:11:09,350 --> 01:11:11,750
That's a lot of fucking people.
If they all hit you at once.

1616
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:15,480
Yes.
So I try to help addicts together on a

1617
01:11:15,481 --> 01:11:18,090
daily one or two.
Not as much as I should.

1618
01:11:18,820 --> 01:11:19,653
That's the right thing.
I,

1619
01:11:20,060 --> 01:11:22,930
I'm kinda disappointed at my level or
yeah.

1620
01:11:23,030 --> 01:11:24,500
Or if somebody else send me like the
same day,

1621
01:11:24,501 --> 01:11:25,390
I'm like,
I've seen that.

1622
01:11:25,940 --> 01:11:30,120
That's not
shame on you when they get a google

1623
01:11:30,121 --> 01:11:30,954
image.
Dick.

1624
01:11:31,070 --> 01:11:32,250
Yeah.
They're like Google image,

1625
01:11:32,251 --> 01:11:33,420
somebody else's Dick.
And I'm like,

1626
01:11:33,421 --> 01:11:34,800
don't do that.
Guess what?

1627
01:11:34,801 --> 01:11:36,720
After this podcast,
they're common.

1628
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:38,710
Thank you Vinnie Johnson.

1629
01:11:38,710 --> 01:11:43,580
Night five following up right now.
You're the camera's clicking away.

1630
01:11:43,730 --> 01:11:46,950
You written on unzipping.
I don't want to filter on them either.

1631
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:52,180
No.
Filters do prefer semi rigid placid.

1632
01:11:53,070 --> 01:11:55,470
I just find it entertaining that anybody
would do it.

1633
01:11:55,550 --> 01:11:59,820
I actually,
I can't ever say that it's different for

1634
01:11:59,821 --> 01:12:01,560
guys.
Like if everyone's like sending you

1635
01:12:01,561 --> 01:12:03,690
boobs,
like you're going to be happy with

1636
01:12:03,750 --> 01:12:04,760
boobs.
Yeah,

1637
01:12:05,010 --> 01:12:06,600
but like,
I don't know any girls,

1638
01:12:06,601 --> 01:12:10,080
they're like stoked.
When a guy sends him a dick pic.

1639
01:12:10,140 --> 01:12:11,820
It's got to be some.
I mean I get,

1640
01:12:11,821 --> 01:12:13,560
trust me,
my phone is filled as some of the

1641
01:12:13,561 --> 01:12:16,050
negative shit you've ever seen.
Like the gift,

1642
01:12:16,051 --> 01:12:17,730
Jif pictures,
videos.

1643
01:12:17,731 --> 01:12:21,270
I have a healthy sense of humor,
but I've never gotten a picture of a

1644
01:12:21,271 --> 01:12:22,680
Dick and been like,
wow,

1645
01:12:23,010 --> 01:12:25,020
that I want to meet the guy attached to
that.

1646
01:12:25,050 --> 01:12:27,510
Like I've never felt that way,
but you're not a whoa.

1647
01:12:27,990 --> 01:12:31,770
Maybe that's it.
Maybe I could try to work on that.

1648
01:12:32,070 --> 01:12:33,490
But it's weird.
Like sometimes I'll,

1649
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:38,070
I'll get a photo like from someone I
have no idea who they are and it's just

1650
01:12:38,071 --> 01:12:39,840
their vagina and I'm like,
okay.

1651
01:12:40,620 --> 01:12:43,320
And you're just like,
well that's not something you would do.

1652
01:12:43,660 --> 01:12:47,160
Right.
But you knew you wouldn't like find some

1653
01:12:47,161 --> 01:12:48,960
musician that you really liked and send
them a picture.

1654
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:52,620
But there's girls who do that.
God bless them,

1655
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:55,350
you know,
they got free time,

1656
01:12:55,351 --> 01:12:57,600
they're proud.
But I think the kind of girl that would

1657
01:12:57,601 --> 01:13:00,690
send you a photo of her vagina,
it was a kind of girl would love a dick

1658
01:13:00,691 --> 01:13:02,120
pic.
Like all right,

1659
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:07,290
you know,
it's good manners.

1660
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:09,850
Bayview give some.
I give some.

1661
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,300
I can't say that I would ever.
I mean I would never do that.

1662
01:13:12,301 --> 01:13:16,290
It's just not.
I just the idea of eat me even doing it

1663
01:13:16,291 --> 01:13:17,190
is hilarious to me.

1664
01:13:17,190 --> 01:13:22,190
Like okay well let me go like and then
like taking a bunch to decide which one

1665
01:13:23,131 --> 01:13:27,510
you liked the most because you know,
it wasn't a one take vagina pick really

1666
01:13:27,511 --> 01:13:29,400
bad.
If you get a vagina pick and it's like

1667
01:13:29,550 --> 01:13:33,900
that sort of frosty foggy photoshop
thing.

1668
01:13:33,930 --> 01:13:35,700
Filter.
It looks like a camera shot or

1669
01:13:35,701 --> 01:13:36,534
something.
Like what the.

1670
01:13:37,070 --> 01:13:39,710
Is that your,
is that a real vagina or is this some

1671
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:43,150
anime?
Send me that in 1977 filter.

1672
01:13:43,410 --> 01:13:45,840
Just fucking playboy from the early
eighties.

1673
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:49,500
You know these,
these weird images,

1674
01:13:49,501 --> 01:13:51,950
like sometimes people will take pictures
and you look at the picture you like,

1675
01:13:51,990 --> 01:13:55,100
that is not even you fucking Dane Cook
has done that a couple of times.

1676
01:13:55,101 --> 01:13:56,190
I've looked at his images.
I'm like,

1677
01:13:56,340 --> 01:13:57,690
what kind of filters?
Using buddy,

1678
01:13:57,960 --> 01:13:59,740
like what's going on here?
He cooks.

1679
01:13:59,940 --> 01:14:04,380
He is a pretty a hilarious instagram
page for all the wrong reasons.

1680
01:14:05,740 --> 01:14:10,430
Should word it properly.
Yeah.

1681
01:14:10,431 --> 01:14:12,040
No,
just him

1682
01:14:12,060 --> 01:14:16,520
without his shirt on or something.
And then this long paragraph of how

1683
01:14:16,521 --> 01:14:21,521
blessed and
at some point I'm like,

1684
01:14:22,241 --> 01:14:24,250
if he is really making a joke,
that's amazing,

1685
01:14:24,251 --> 01:14:27,840
but he's not hashtag blessed.
Blessed.

1686
01:14:28,030 --> 01:14:29,730
I can't even do it.
It's a joke.

1687
01:14:29,950 --> 01:14:32,720
Maybe the entire thing has been
following mice.

1688
01:14:32,770 --> 01:14:36,340
Just randomly type in his name and then
just because I'm like,

1689
01:14:36,350 --> 01:14:38,560
let me see what this is.
And then it never.

1690
01:14:38,561 --> 01:14:40,810
It never doesn't make me laugh.
It's funny.

1691
01:14:40,811 --> 01:14:43,120
Every single time I've seen some good
ones.

1692
01:14:43,330 --> 01:14:45,760
There's a lot of people that are fall
looked out there just to just say

1693
01:14:45,910 --> 01:14:47,860
ridiculous shit.
So I follow them for that.

1694
01:14:48,170 --> 01:14:49,690
Just hoping they're going to say
something stupid.

1695
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:54,720
I liked the people that will post things
like to show you how great their life

1696
01:14:55,151 --> 01:14:58,210
is.
It's the humble brag kind of way.

1697
01:14:58,720 --> 01:15:03,720
Like I remember this one girl was like
trying to show that her son had straight

1698
01:15:04,571 --> 01:15:09,520
a's on his report card and so like the
way that she was holding it was also to

1699
01:15:09,521 --> 01:15:12,850
show that she was wearing a rolex and
shit fucking ring on.

1700
01:15:12,850 --> 01:15:15,640
But it was like perfectly in the frame
that way.

1701
01:15:16,090 --> 01:15:20,290
But that is amazing that you just did
that and I know exactly what you're

1702
01:15:20,291 --> 01:15:25,291
doing but you think you're outsmarting.
Everyone is so proud of my son.

1703
01:15:26,771 --> 01:15:31,771
Hashtag let my son and then just
weird little monkeys in that regard.

1704
01:15:34,180 --> 01:15:38,690
Peacocking monkeys and in some things
it's like I,

1705
01:15:38,830 --> 01:15:42,700
my mom is like the best at this because
if my sister will send like a picture of

1706
01:15:42,701 --> 01:15:44,440
my nephew on his first day of school,
you know,

1707
01:15:44,441 --> 01:15:49,000
everybody likes to do that first day of
school lunchbox backpack and standing in

1708
01:15:49,001 --> 01:15:52,750
front of the front door and my mom were,
will reply back because it'll be like a

1709
01:15:52,751 --> 01:15:54,930
group email and she'll go,
oh,

1710
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:57,310
you need to get those fingerprints off
the front door.

1711
01:15:57,311 --> 01:16:00,460
You have fingerprints.
Like she looks past the picture to see

1712
01:16:00,461 --> 01:16:03,180
what's behind that.
My sister's front door has glass

1713
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:05,770
fingerprints everywhere.

1714
01:16:06,010 --> 01:16:09,520
Like I kind of love that.
And if you look at everyone's picture

1715
01:16:09,521 --> 01:16:11,200
and do that,
it's pretty hysterical.

1716
01:16:11,201 --> 01:16:12,430
Like,
what's in the background?

1717
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:15,160
I love that.
It makes me laugh every time was one of

1718
01:16:15,161 --> 01:16:17,170
the saddest pictures I ever saw was this
girl.

1719
01:16:17,410 --> 01:16:19,930
She had her ass up in the year and uh,
you know,

1720
01:16:20,030 --> 01:16:22,820
she's like posing style and then the
background,

1721
01:16:22,870 --> 01:16:26,950
the lower left corner is a baby crawling
around like a little toddler.

1722
01:16:26,980 --> 01:16:28,090
It's like,
Whoa,

1723
01:16:28,570 --> 01:16:31,000
that's dark.
Like you could see them like in the

1724
01:16:31,001 --> 01:16:33,190
hallway in the lower left corner of the
picture,

1725
01:16:33,191 --> 01:16:36,300
like Oh God,
it's so like,

1726
01:16:36,301 --> 01:16:39,130
it's disgusting.
But then I also like,

1727
01:16:39,131 --> 01:16:41,860
um,
there's certain people that will post

1728
01:16:42,430 --> 01:16:44,560
the picture where maybe they're on the
beach.

1729
01:16:44,980 --> 01:16:46,690
Okay.
And they're looking down at the water

1730
01:16:47,260 --> 01:16:51,040
and they'll put some like inspirational
quotes,

1731
01:16:51,460 --> 01:16:52,690
you know,
something that's like,

1732
01:16:52,691 --> 01:16:54,420
you know,
Jesus be with,

1733
01:16:54,430 --> 01:16:56,740
well blah blah blah.
All I'm going is who the fuck to that

1734
01:16:56,770 --> 01:17:00,340
took that picture.
You had to ask somebody to do that and I

1735
01:17:00,341 --> 01:17:02,590
guarantee you again,
wasn't a first tight eat.

1736
01:17:02,650 --> 01:17:05,400
Like it was not the first take.
Like they had the gun to get up at rock,

1737
01:17:05,401 --> 01:17:09,070
a little Morgan,
my jawline to look sharp and look like

1738
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:09,980
really smart.

1739
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:14,720
And I that that's actually my favorite
thing on instagram.

1740
01:17:15,170 --> 01:17:18,770
I just like looking at people's pictures
when like what are you trying to get

1741
01:17:18,771 --> 01:17:21,890
across to everybody?
Like knowing,

1742
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:25,160
knowing the people are going to see it
and like I know what you're doing,

1743
01:17:25,430 --> 01:17:27,990
but some people can do it and it works.
Like,

1744
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:28,681
like,
you know,

1745
01:17:28,681 --> 01:17:31,940
who I followed,
I legitimately enjoy is the rock.

1746
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:35,780
The rock gets it too.
I think that he gets,

1747
01:17:35,810 --> 01:17:37,010
he's having fun,
having fun.

1748
01:17:38,060 --> 01:17:40,610
I actually,
I liked him but he's inspirational.

1749
01:17:40,820 --> 01:17:43,940
Like he'll,
he'll post like stuff about him getting

1750
01:17:43,941 --> 01:17:47,900
up at 5:00 in the morning to work out
before getting to the set and I don't

1751
01:17:47,901 --> 01:17:50,360
feel like he's bragging at all.
I feel like he's inspiring people.

1752
01:17:50,450 --> 01:17:52,410
Like he inspires me.
Yeah.

1753
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:54,470
Actually that kind of stuff we'll get,
you know.

1754
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:55,460
Okay.
Yeah.

1755
01:17:55,460 --> 01:17:56,370
Get to the gym to,
you know.

1756
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:56,930
Yeah.
Yeah.

1757
01:17:56,930 --> 01:18:01,930
It is kind of a.
But I don't feel that he's full of Shit.

1758
01:18:02,031 --> 01:18:03,350
I've never felt like he was full of
Shit.

1759
01:18:03,351 --> 01:18:06,440
I even when he was fucking wrestling,
he got it.

1760
01:18:06,441 --> 01:18:07,580
He's wrestling.
It's funny,

1761
01:18:07,581 --> 01:18:10,040
you know,
he's playing a character and I have

1762
01:18:10,160 --> 01:18:12,260
always liked him.
I thought he was by all accounts.

1763
01:18:12,261 --> 01:18:14,570
He's a really great guy.
Everybody that I've ever met that met

1764
01:18:14,580 --> 01:18:16,670
him,
worked with him or knew him.

1765
01:18:16,671 --> 01:18:18,890
So there's a really nice guy just having
fun.

1766
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:20,200
Have you ever met him before?
Yeah,

1767
01:18:20,210 --> 01:18:23,390
I met her a long time ago.
I've met him before he was the rock.

1768
01:18:23,780 --> 01:18:25,700
He wasn't really that famous.
I met him.

1769
01:18:25,750 --> 01:18:29,870
I was on MTV for one of those spring
break things in Mexico,

1770
01:18:30,110 --> 01:18:32,060
like Cancun or something like that.
Speaking.

1771
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:33,530
I just said hi to him.
It's just a big guy,

1772
01:18:33,531 --> 01:18:34,364
but he wasn't big.

1773
01:18:34,410 --> 01:18:35,840
He is now.
He's just like,

1774
01:18:36,020 --> 01:18:41,020
he looked like a regular athlete now
he's just as fucking gigantic muscled

1775
01:18:41,781 --> 01:18:44,860
guy.
I can't remember what it was and maybe

1776
01:18:44,861 --> 01:18:48,410
it was like some after Emmy per after
Golden Globe party or whatever,

1777
01:18:48,411 --> 01:18:50,840
and I saw him and he was.
He's a fucking wall.

1778
01:18:51,170 --> 01:18:54,770
A huge dude.
He's like 2:50 all muscle and no fast.

1779
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:56,480
Completely.
Just totally hooked.

1780
01:18:56,481 --> 01:18:57,314
Yeah,
he's,

1781
01:18:57,930 --> 01:19:00,200
I like him.
He's a nice guy.

1782
01:19:00,470 --> 01:19:02,840
He seems like a nice guy,
but it's frozen chicken.

1783
01:19:02,841 --> 01:19:04,100
I'd fuck him.
How about that?

1784
01:19:04,410 --> 01:19:05,243
Nope.
I said it.

1785
01:19:06,310 --> 01:19:07,760
I said it.
I like it.

1786
01:19:10,370 --> 01:19:11,960
Yeah.
He's one of the few guys that poses in

1787
01:19:11,961 --> 01:19:13,640
front of a private jet that doesn't
bother me.

1788
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:16,960
You know,
like please God,

1789
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:20,090
that's such a heady time.
I've been on a private jet.

1790
01:19:20,091 --> 01:19:20,871
I'm like,
oh,

1791
01:19:20,871 --> 01:19:22,270
I could never do it.
Really.

1792
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:24,800
I couldn't do it and I would feel so
Douchey,

1793
01:19:25,100 --> 01:19:25,900
Douchey,
moved,

1794
01:19:25,900 --> 01:19:30,900
but
velvet suit and again see that someone

1795
01:19:31,581 --> 01:19:34,400
had to take that photo,
but it doesn't bother me.

1796
01:19:35,390 --> 01:19:36,950
We own the night.
Thank you.

1797
01:19:36,951 --> 01:19:40,360
Golden Globes for a spectacular evening.
Wheels up admiring me.

1798
01:19:40,370 --> 01:19:43,020
Bound ballers.
Set.

1799
01:19:43,021 --> 01:19:44,810
Here I come.
Let's shoot ball.

1800
01:19:44,811 --> 01:19:47,510
So hard.
Hashtag velvet blazer.

1801
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:52,140
That is a.
That is a massive potential for Douche

1802
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:54,020
involved in that photo.
It was overwhelming.

1803
01:19:54,021 --> 01:19:56,840
Yet it doesn't come off.
Douchey for whatever reason.

1804
01:19:56,900 --> 01:19:58,550
For 30 3:00 AM.
See that

1805
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:03,890
cardio before I head to work?
Yes.

1806
01:20:04,010 --> 01:20:06,260
Hashtag Jesus needs a cup of them
loaded.

1807
01:20:07,970 --> 01:20:08,880
Let's roll.

1808
01:20:09,260 --> 01:20:11,790
I mean it doesn't bother me.
He's just one of those guys.

1809
01:20:11,791 --> 01:20:12,830
He can get away with it.
Oh,

1810
01:20:12,860 --> 01:20:15,180
only 300.
19,000 likes.

1811
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:18,300
That's what does he have?
Like 50 million followers or something

1812
01:20:18,301 --> 01:20:19,134
like that?
I

1813
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:25,640
think I have like 800,000 step video of
what happened was instagram account with

1814
01:20:25,950 --> 01:20:27,960
when you have 8 million followers,
when you post something,

1815
01:20:28,110 --> 01:20:30,690
what happens?
Just explodes.

1816
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:33,600
This person's phone go crazy.
Oh,

1817
01:20:33,601 --> 01:20:37,950
well you have the fucking turned off or
turned on.

1818
01:20:38,010 --> 01:20:40,320
Oh my God.
That would be insane.

1819
01:20:40,321 --> 01:20:43,430
Have you ever been with somebody that
has a lot of followers and then you see

1820
01:20:43,730 --> 01:20:46,820
a notification pop up that they had a
line here that some.

1821
01:20:46,910 --> 01:20:49,860
Have you ever been around somebody that
Doug Benson used to have that he shut it

1822
01:20:49,861 --> 01:20:52,440
off,
but just to have that like,

1823
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:53,730
oh my God,
look at the phone.

1824
01:20:55,530 --> 01:20:57,750
Oh my God,
that's insane.

1825
01:20:58,530 --> 01:20:59,790
Oh my God.

1826
01:20:59,970 --> 01:21:03,540
That is insane.
Like a soccer accounts to six soccer

1827
01:21:03,541 --> 01:21:06,360
sports teams kind of thing.
Oh my God.

1828
01:21:06,361 --> 01:21:08,820
That is fucking insane.
For the phone.

1829
01:21:08,821 --> 01:21:12,390
It was like a waterfall.
It'd be a great way to test the battery.

1830
01:21:12,570 --> 01:21:17,570
That battery life is just shrinking top.
Just like a Gigantic v eight engine when

1831
01:21:18,661 --> 01:21:20,910
you stomp on the gas.
That is insane.

1832
01:21:21,060 --> 01:21:22,950
That is amazing.
Wow.

1833
01:21:23,790 --> 01:21:26,180
Rich kids of China just do that.
Well,

1834
01:21:26,670 --> 01:21:28,470
any rich people?
Instagram,

1835
01:21:28,471 --> 01:21:31,080
like rich kids of Dubai,
like those.

1836
01:21:31,380 --> 01:21:33,400
Those things are hilarious.
God,

1837
01:21:33,420 --> 01:21:37,620
that's amazing.
Strange and not have the notification

1838
01:21:37,621 --> 01:21:38,454
thing.
I just don't.

1839
01:21:38,730 --> 01:21:39,900
I don't know.
I don't care enough.

1840
01:21:39,901 --> 01:21:41,340
I guess maybe I should.
Well,

1841
01:21:41,341 --> 01:21:43,980
it's just not smart.
Phone was constantly.

1842
01:21:43,981 --> 01:21:46,320
I mean my phone if it.
If you text me,

1843
01:21:46,321 --> 01:21:50,970
I assume I like you and I want to talk
to you and that's what essentially it is

1844
01:21:51,420 --> 01:21:52,830
reaching out and contacting you.

1845
01:21:52,830 --> 01:21:55,290
And I have to always,
but I don't even keep that.

1846
01:21:55,860 --> 01:22:00,120
I don't keep a notification even for a
text you don't know because of buzz.

1847
01:22:00,150 --> 01:22:02,190
Your phone isn't buzzard some texts and
everything turned off.

1848
01:22:02,191 --> 01:22:04,870
So because I don't like being rude when
I'm in front of like,

1849
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:07,840
like when it's,
if,

1850
01:22:08,240 --> 01:22:09,760
if it was an emergency,
you know,

1851
01:22:09,770 --> 01:22:12,990
like don't call you or something.
Huh?

1852
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:16,920
Well everybody must know then you,
you can't text Jenny and hover text you

1853
01:22:16,921 --> 01:22:18,230
right back.
Well I feel like,

1854
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:20,000
you know,
like if you're at dinner with your

1855
01:22:20,010 --> 01:22:23,280
friends or something and people lose
that friend that just won't put the

1856
01:22:23,281 --> 01:22:24,750
fucking phone down.
That's rude.

1857
01:22:25,430 --> 01:22:26,263
So I just,
I,

1858
01:22:26,270 --> 01:22:29,370
so if anything I'm doing,
I always try to keep my phone.

1859
01:22:29,970 --> 01:22:32,940
You ever see a Anthony Bourdain's show?
Parts unknown?

1860
01:22:33,510 --> 01:22:34,360
Uh,
actually I,

1861
01:22:34,450 --> 01:22:36,540
I caught part of it the other night.
Great fucking show.

1862
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:38,730
But anyway,
he has these friends that he turned me

1863
01:22:38,731 --> 01:22:41,370
onto that are in Montreal.
They owned this restaurant called Joe

1864
01:22:41,371 --> 01:22:46,371
beef and it's fucking fantastic
community is one of the greatest

1865
01:22:46,621 --> 01:22:49,380
restaurants in the history of the world
and they did this episode with these

1866
01:22:49,381 --> 01:22:51,380
guys were,
they were on the,

1867
01:22:51,450 --> 01:22:55,020
they went ice fishing and they set up
this ice fiscal because they're in

1868
01:22:55,021 --> 01:22:56,580
Montreal,
so it's cold as fuck.

1869
01:22:56,581 --> 01:23:00,630
So they set up this shack on a lake and
inside they had like a full gourmet

1870
01:23:00,631 --> 01:23:02,490
meal.
They set up like the whole deal,

1871
01:23:02,491 --> 01:23:05,080
like beautiful tablecloths,
great food and hold you.

1872
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:08,440
And they were talking about like,
how do you set up like,

1873
01:23:08,441 --> 01:23:09,041
what do you,
what do you,

1874
01:23:09,041 --> 01:23:10,690
what do you have rules when you go to
dinner?

1875
01:23:10,930 --> 01:23:11,890
And he was like,
rule number one.

1876
01:23:11,891 --> 01:23:13,470
I shut my phone off because I,
I'm,

1877
01:23:13,540 --> 01:23:14,373
I'm,
you know,

1878
01:23:14,380 --> 01:23:15,700
I want to have a good conversation.

1879
01:23:15,710 --> 01:23:18,990
You want to be a good dinner guest?
I want to be someone who's like,

1880
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:20,260
how?
How many people do that?

1881
01:23:20,261 --> 01:23:22,900
How many people shut their phone off?
Just shut your fucking phone off.

1882
01:23:23,140 --> 01:23:27,340
Very few times you go to a restaurant,
you see people just staring at our phone

1883
01:23:27,370 --> 01:23:29,490
with another person's over there staring
at their phone,

1884
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:34,150
right?
Jesus love texting each other.

1885
01:23:34,410 --> 01:23:37,990
Family of four and the kids had even had
head phones on and they're just staring

1886
01:23:37,991 --> 01:23:40,360
and you're like,
your communication skills are going to

1887
01:23:40,361 --> 01:23:43,150
suck ass when you're older because no
one's talking to you.

1888
01:23:43,151 --> 01:23:45,550
You don't want to talk to them.
No one's forcing you to.

1889
01:23:45,610 --> 01:23:48,430
Well,
I have a folder on my phone that's all

1890
01:23:48,431 --> 01:23:49,540
for my kids.
My kids,

1891
01:23:49,541 --> 01:23:52,780
their little fingerprints open my phone
up and they'll like if I,

1892
01:23:52,781 --> 01:23:55,810
if I leave my phone around,
they grab it because they think it's fun

1893
01:23:55,811 --> 01:23:58,720
to take your fingerprint.
Five and seven at the little one.

1894
01:23:59,070 --> 01:24:02,950
And so they'll go to the folder and if I
don't let them,

1895
01:24:02,990 --> 01:24:04,180
if I don't let him play with the phone
like,

1896
01:24:04,190 --> 01:24:04,410
no,
no,

1897
01:24:04,410 --> 01:24:04,811
no.
Come on,

1898
01:24:04,811 --> 01:24:05,860
let's just have a conversation.

1899
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:11,260
You can just pull.
Can I just play with your phone?

1900
01:24:11,261 --> 01:24:12,094
Like,
no you can't.

1901
01:24:12,460 --> 01:24:13,310
Can I play with your phone?
No,

1902
01:24:13,330 --> 01:24:15,220
I just said you can't definitely please
put your phone.

1903
01:24:15,221 --> 01:24:16,390
No,
you can't play with the phone.

1904
01:24:16,391 --> 01:24:20,830
Let's just hang out and talk.
That hovers over your head as an option

1905
01:24:20,920 --> 01:24:24,160
to talking to your parents.
It's so attractive that they just can't.

1906
01:24:24,161 --> 01:24:25,570
What can I play with your phone now?
No,

1907
01:24:25,571 --> 01:24:27,250
you just asked 30 seconds ago.
You little fuck.

1908
01:24:27,430 --> 01:24:30,520
Come on
and we'll say that but it.

1909
01:24:30,660 --> 01:24:33,220
But it is.
I mean like I like I saw kids actually

1910
01:24:33,221 --> 01:24:36,340
will walk in just a group of kids where
my,

1911
01:24:36,341 --> 01:24:38,020
uh,
where the gym is that I work at it.

1912
01:24:38,050 --> 01:24:42,490
We're like Fairfax high school is so I
go to this little boxing gym and there's

1913
01:24:42,491 --> 01:24:45,580
an alleyway where the kids will walk and
so like when you're in there you can

1914
01:24:45,581 --> 01:24:48,850
watch them walking after school and
every single one it's just buried in

1915
01:24:48,851 --> 01:24:49,480
their phone.

1916
01:24:49,480 --> 01:24:52,720
They don't look up there.
Just some lady walked right into me at

1917
01:24:52,721 --> 01:24:55,590
the airport the other day.
I just stood like,

1918
01:24:55,750 --> 01:24:58,090
like she going to walk right into me.
Bam.

1919
01:24:58,180 --> 01:25:01,390
Just wasn't even looking.
Just hoping that people would just get

1920
01:25:01,391 --> 01:25:02,650
out of her way.
I was like,

1921
01:25:02,651 --> 01:25:05,500
this is hilarious.
This lady is just walking forward while

1922
01:25:05,501 --> 01:25:07,210
texting.
All I did was stop.

1923
01:25:07,660 --> 01:25:08,493
I was like,
okay,

1924
01:25:08,830 --> 01:25:11,770
what's going on here?
Like she can't just like go to the side

1925
01:25:11,771 --> 01:25:16,160
and just how do you walk in text?
I ended with an airport.

1926
01:25:16,690 --> 01:25:18,270
Yeah,
and plus there's fucking chairs like

1927
01:25:18,340 --> 01:25:20,890
everywhere obviously bitch one of the
gates.

1928
01:25:21,130 --> 01:25:23,150
Well how many times you've been on the
road and you'd watch someone's swerving

1929
01:25:23,151 --> 01:25:24,370
and you go,
this fucker's texting.

1930
01:25:24,371 --> 01:25:27,160
I know what you pull up beside them and
see the light of their phone

1931
01:25:27,161 --> 01:25:30,760
illuminating your face is there or when
it's like you're at a red light,

1932
01:25:30,790 --> 01:25:35,470
light turns green and they're still
sitting there because there is somebody

1933
01:25:35,471 --> 01:25:36,760
has to honk and then we'll.

1934
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:39,640
This again.
I think these things go back to what I

1935
01:25:39,641 --> 01:25:43,500
was talking about earlier.
That media I think is too compelling for

1936
01:25:43,501 --> 01:25:47,650
our natural response systems or natural
instincts and reward systems that are in

1937
01:25:47,651 --> 01:25:50,680
place for people like this is too much
going on there.

1938
01:25:50,740 --> 01:25:52,920
It's too fun.
It's to peek in there,

1939
01:25:53,410 --> 01:25:54,243
you know,
like,

1940
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:57,340
but if you ever get like where you were
on a long flight and there was no Wifi

1941
01:25:57,341 --> 01:26:00,050
or whatever and you couldn't wait to
play with your phone [inaudible],

1942
01:26:00,550 --> 01:26:02,980
you know,
sometimes five hour flight you.

1943
01:26:03,320 --> 01:26:05,390
And then when you're finally in a chair
and you're comfortable,

1944
01:26:05,391 --> 01:26:07,220
you're like,
check mark

1945
01:26:09,230 --> 01:26:11,540
when you go to Australia,
16 hours.

1946
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:16,640
Anything can happen.
We know about that lady that texted that

1947
01:26:17,180 --> 01:26:19,550
joke about aids.
Well that was,

1948
01:26:19,570 --> 01:26:20,720
we were talking about what you're
talking about.

1949
01:26:20,721 --> 01:26:24,880
You did.
It was like one of those people that

1950
01:26:24,890 --> 01:26:25,610
would do that.

1951
01:26:25,610 --> 01:26:29,110
She would text funny shit like
controversial.

1952
01:26:29,290 --> 01:26:31,160
Try to be funny,
trying to be rude.

1953
01:26:31,610 --> 01:26:34,430
And she texts this joke about I'm going
to Africa,

1954
01:26:34,431 --> 01:26:36,200
hope I don't get aids.
Just kidding.

1955
01:26:36,201 --> 01:26:37,250
I'm white,
lol.

1956
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,760
Which I read and it was funny.
I laugh,

1957
01:26:41,420 --> 01:26:44,090
she's fucked.
I mean she got chicken,

1958
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:47,690
did she got shit canned and now she
works for one of those,

1959
01:26:47,691 --> 01:26:49,350
uh,
like sorta like draft kings,

1960
01:26:49,351 --> 01:26:51,860
one of those kinds of companies.
There are fees involved in another

1961
01:26:51,861 --> 01:26:53,600
company.
Why are they getting shaken?

1962
01:26:53,601 --> 01:26:56,570
The owners,
they got too greedy with their

1963
01:26:56,571 --> 01:26:57,860
commercials.
Oh really?

1964
01:26:57,861 --> 01:27:00,830
Now because everybody that did fantasy
football and shit like that were,

1965
01:27:01,550 --> 01:27:02,940
you know,
all the cool dudes.

1966
01:27:02,941 --> 01:27:05,850
If I go to hooters on Saturday morning
to draft my team,

1967
01:27:05,851 --> 01:27:06,770
you know,
that kind of thing.

1968
01:27:07,010 --> 01:27:09,740
And I think that it just got to like in
your face like,

1969
01:27:09,741 --> 01:27:10,461
yeah,
we're gambling,

1970
01:27:10,461 --> 01:27:11,030
we don't give a shit.

1971
01:27:11,030 --> 01:27:13,070
Here's our ad for it.
Like you can't do that,

1972
01:27:13,580 --> 01:27:15,350
but it should be legal.
It should,

1973
01:27:15,690 --> 01:27:18,500
it should totally be legal.
But the reason they're in trouble I

1974
01:27:18,501 --> 01:27:21,170
think because they get too greedy.
Is that why they're in trouble,

1975
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:22,460
Jamie,
you know about all that stuff.

1976
01:27:23,490 --> 01:27:27,050
Is that whether in trouble sort of sort
of there being,

1977
01:27:27,380 --> 01:27:30,020
from what I understand there's,
they're being a little bit deceptive and

1978
01:27:30,021 --> 01:27:33,980
what's actually going on
from what I've read,

1979
01:27:34,070 --> 01:27:37,340
one percent of the people that actually
play are winning like 99 percent of the

1980
01:27:37,341 --> 01:27:39,350
money.
Smart ones like the rest of the world.

1981
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:43,100
And have some algorithms used to be a
professional poker players online.

1982
01:27:43,970 --> 01:27:45,410
Sort of.
Oh,

1983
01:27:45,411 --> 01:27:48,110
so they've figured out how to do it with
math.

1984
01:27:48,200 --> 01:27:49,033
Yeah,
exactly.

1985
01:27:51,260 --> 01:27:52,790
I would not be able to do that.
Well,

1986
01:27:52,791 --> 01:27:56,030
I used to have the sponsor called
lumosity and lumosity is like their

1987
01:27:56,031 --> 01:27:58,430
brain games and they're supposed to like
increase your Iq.

1988
01:27:58,431 --> 01:28:00,140
They're kind of interesting.
They're supposed to increase.

1989
01:28:00,620 --> 01:28:05,620
There are games that you play that can
actually accelerate learning or help you

1990
01:28:06,831 --> 01:28:10,040
learn or make your brain work better or
something like three's the.

1991
01:28:10,041 --> 01:28:12,740
There's some number games they're
supposed to help you.

1992
01:28:12,770 --> 01:28:13,790
Chess,
chess.

1993
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:18,410
It helps your brain while these people
got greedy with their claims and now

1994
01:28:18,411 --> 01:28:21,320
they're fucked and they go.
They just had a judgment against him for

1995
01:28:21,321 --> 01:28:23,360
like millions of dollars have payback.
Yeah,

1996
01:28:23,730 --> 01:28:25,790
because they were saying shit like it
could.

1997
01:28:26,260 --> 01:28:30,680
I guess they had alluded to the idea
that it would help stave off early

1998
01:28:31,070 --> 01:28:32,800
Alzheimer's.
Yeah.

1999
01:28:32,970 --> 01:28:37,220
I had read something about that because
there was different games and there was

2000
01:28:37,221 --> 01:28:41,520
something that was
like if you're driving somewhere and

2001
01:28:41,590 --> 01:28:44,450
there was a thing like drive with oven
mitts on or you know.

2002
01:28:44,720 --> 01:28:46,640
Yeah.
Like it was like do something different.

2003
01:28:46,641 --> 01:28:48,410
Like you always go to the grocery store,
you go on this.

2004
01:28:48,411 --> 01:28:49,970
I'll start.
I'll start in the middle.

2005
01:28:50,890 --> 01:28:53,690
So as people get older,
as you get older,

2006
01:28:53,691 --> 01:28:56,060
you really get set in your ways and so
you know,

2007
01:28:56,061 --> 01:28:57,860
to go this way to this place,
go the other way.

2008
01:28:58,050 --> 01:28:59,690
Oh,
how fucked up.

2009
01:29:00,100 --> 01:29:03,330
But something to just kind of jar your
brain to make you.

2010
01:29:03,750 --> 01:29:04,351
Oh,
okay.

2011
01:29:04,351 --> 01:29:07,410
Now I have to think because usually
after a while you're just a robot if

2012
01:29:07,690 --> 01:29:10,020
you're doing it exactly the same damn
thing.

2013
01:29:10,021 --> 01:29:12,050
And so different grocery store you go
to,

2014
01:29:12,490 --> 01:29:13,590
you know,
like that kind of thing.

2015
01:29:13,591 --> 01:29:17,340
And it was my mom's.
I told her about this and she goes,

2016
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:18,070
oh,
well,

2017
01:29:18,070 --> 01:29:18,751
okay,
well tell me.

2018
01:29:18,751 --> 01:29:19,141
And I said,
well,

2019
01:29:19,141 --> 01:29:20,580
like when you go to the grocery store,
I said,

2020
01:29:20,990 --> 01:29:22,410
um,
go a different route,

2021
01:29:22,411 --> 01:29:24,570
take you know,
take the seventh street and go around

2022
01:29:24,990 --> 01:29:25,823
doing that.

2023
01:29:27,110 --> 01:29:27,511
I was like,
okay,

2024
01:29:27,511 --> 01:29:29,490
well when you have the best,
but when you go and you always start at

2025
01:29:29,491 --> 01:29:31,260
produce,
this is go start at the bread.

2026
01:29:31,261 --> 01:29:32,940
I only other said,
well that's just stupid.

2027
01:29:32,941 --> 01:29:34,170
I'm not doing.
I was like,

2028
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:36,430
well I'll buy and I'll see in the
nursing home and always

2029
01:29:38,610 --> 01:29:42,630
trying to help people.
It's weird that people have that thing

2030
01:29:42,631 --> 01:29:47,631
where like patterns or they actually
sort of like limit the possibilities

2031
01:29:48,091 --> 01:29:51,810
that your brain has to consider.
So your brain sort of atrophies almost

2032
01:29:51,811 --> 01:29:52,431
like,
you know,

2033
01:29:52,431 --> 01:29:55,440
like not lifting weights are not
exercising or something along those

2034
01:29:55,441 --> 01:29:58,770
lines.
Like I mean like I have to go exercise.

2035
01:29:58,950 --> 01:30:00,780
That helps me.
Like it makes me.

2036
01:30:01,260 --> 01:30:02,670
Oh yeah,
that helps.

2037
01:30:02,671 --> 01:30:04,770
That helps a lot.
But do you do that before shows?

2038
01:30:04,771 --> 01:30:07,470
Do you find that like if you have an
important show that exercising sort of

2039
01:30:07,471 --> 01:30:08,070
leaving it?

2040
01:30:08,070 --> 01:30:12,380
I try to do.
For me it's cardio like hard cardio or

2041
01:30:12,390 --> 01:30:15,720
do like elliptical machine or something
like that for like a half an hour before

2042
01:30:15,721 --> 01:30:17,850
show of,
Oh I feel so much better.

2043
01:30:17,870 --> 01:30:21,060
It's almost,
it's almost like I know it doesn't work

2044
01:30:21,061 --> 01:30:23,160
that way,
but it's almost like I got clean out my

2045
01:30:23,161 --> 01:30:26,400
brain pipes.
Like I'm just flushing the system blood.

2046
01:30:26,460 --> 01:30:29,670
I know it doesn't really work that way.
I actually think it does because if you

2047
01:30:29,671 --> 01:30:32,130
ever had a show where you know you've
got somewhere and you're like,

2048
01:30:32,131 --> 01:30:32,610
okay,
I have to,

2049
01:30:32,610 --> 01:30:34,740
I have to take a nap because I've been
going,

2050
01:30:34,750 --> 01:30:37,560
going to take a nap,
you wake up to go to the show,

2051
01:30:38,030 --> 01:30:39,670
and I'm like,
I just,

2052
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:41,580
you know,
just woken up.

2053
01:30:42,120 --> 01:30:46,620
I just don't feel as sharp as if I,
you know,

2054
01:30:46,680 --> 01:30:49,230
when I go work out and then I'm just
going,

2055
01:30:49,231 --> 01:30:50,490
I'm like,
I'm ready to go.

2056
01:30:50,490 --> 01:30:51,271
Then.
Yeah.

2057
01:30:51,271 --> 01:30:55,020
I don't know know exactly what the
mechanisms are that are going on inside

2058
01:30:55,021 --> 01:30:58,920
the mind when you're exercising,
but there's something that the mind gets

2059
01:30:58,921 --> 01:31:03,060
exercised too as well as the body
because your mind has to move the body,

2060
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:08,360
like you think of exercise being a non
mental thing because oh,

2061
01:31:08,521 --> 01:31:10,520
your just immediate.
Just feel good and working out,

2062
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:13,110
lifting weights,
but there's something that's going on

2063
01:31:13,111 --> 01:31:16,200
while your brain is forcing your body to
do these movements.

2064
01:31:16,210 --> 01:31:18,510
You're,
you're exercising willpower,

2065
01:31:18,690 --> 01:31:21,060
you're exercising like determination and
focus.

2066
01:31:21,061 --> 01:31:24,900
There's always things that are going on
that I think accentuate intellectual

2067
01:31:24,901 --> 01:31:25,870
pursuits.
Yeah.

2068
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:27,150
If that makes any sense.
No,

2069
01:31:27,151 --> 01:31:28,880
it does,
I mean like I,

2070
01:31:28,881 --> 01:31:32,880
I go to this boxing gym and I don't
actually spar with people but it's just

2071
01:31:32,910 --> 01:31:36,110
one on one me and my trainer,
but heel pads on his hands and he,

2072
01:31:36,840 --> 01:31:41,820
I have to do combinations so I have to
think and I know when I start getting

2073
01:31:41,821 --> 01:31:43,800
really tired and I need to contribute a
water,

2074
01:31:43,801 --> 01:31:47,670
like I'll start forgetting.
I can watch myself be fresh and then I'm

2075
01:31:47,671 --> 01:31:48,421
like,
oh Whoa,

2076
01:31:48,421 --> 01:31:48,961
whoa.
Yeah,

2077
01:31:48,961 --> 01:31:50,130
you told me to waive.
Okay,

2078
01:31:50,131 --> 01:31:52,620
hang on,
go back at it again.

2079
01:31:52,621 --> 01:31:53,950
Let me get a drink of water.
But it,

2080
01:31:54,330 --> 01:31:56,950
I like it because it makes me think
while I'm doing something right,

2081
01:31:57,210 --> 01:31:59,280
I still have to concentrate on.
Exactly.

2082
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:00,370
You know,

2083
01:32:00,370 --> 01:32:03,310
whatever it is I'm doing.
So there is something to it.

2084
01:32:03,660 --> 01:32:05,650
I agree with that.
Any,

2085
01:32:05,830 --> 01:32:08,050
any sort of exercise that you have to
think about?

2086
01:32:08,051 --> 01:32:11,590
Things like they say handball is really
good for the mind,

2087
01:32:11,830 --> 01:32:13,000
like yeah,
yeah,

2088
01:32:13,060 --> 01:32:14,500
racketball,
handball,

2089
01:32:14,501 --> 01:32:16,060
things on those lines with that ball's
coming.

2090
01:32:16,061 --> 01:32:19,870
You don't know where it's gone.
You have to really anticipate what's

2091
01:32:19,871 --> 01:32:20,870
happening.
Yeah,

2092
01:32:20,970 --> 01:32:22,690
I would imagine tennis would be the same
thing.

2093
01:32:23,560 --> 01:32:26,490
Like because your,
your hand eye coordination involved with

2094
01:32:26,500 --> 01:32:29,530
fast motion calculations,
the spin of the ball,

2095
01:32:29,531 --> 01:32:33,820
the ball's bouncing here goes a lot of
different things you have to sort of

2096
01:32:33,821 --> 01:32:36,850
trick your mind into getting engaged
with.

2097
01:32:38,130 --> 01:32:39,250
Now.
I agree with that.

2098
01:32:39,251 --> 01:32:41,440
I mean it's,
I don't know.

2099
01:32:41,510 --> 01:32:44,890
I don't know like what Causes
Alzheimer's?

2100
01:32:44,891 --> 01:32:46,300
Like what,
what's the cause of it?

2101
01:32:46,301 --> 01:32:47,980
Is it just.
I think it's a genetic issue,

2102
01:32:48,120 --> 01:32:49,240
is it?
Believe so.

2103
01:32:49,580 --> 01:32:52,900
I believe it's the people who have a
genetic propensity for it.

2104
01:32:53,290 --> 01:32:56,480
I wonder if people that just do like
when people get old and they're just in

2105
01:32:56,481 --> 01:32:59,650
their recliner all fucking day long and
that's watching the same shit.

2106
01:33:00,040 --> 01:33:02,470
Like you're not challenging yourself
ever.

2107
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:05,440
Yeah.
I wonder if that factors in at all.

2108
01:33:05,500 --> 01:33:08,530
I think it certainly could factor in,
but people that have it,

2109
01:33:08,590 --> 01:33:10,370
it is a disease.
Um,

2110
01:33:11,110 --> 01:33:15,460
people that I know,
I have a friend who's girlfriend's dad

2111
01:33:15,461 --> 01:33:19,660
has it and they have to go visit and
it's just,

2112
01:33:19,930 --> 01:33:21,730
he's just barely there.
He's just,

2113
01:33:22,180 --> 01:33:27,180
he's completely out of it.
And he was an interesting podcast,

2114
01:33:27,490 --> 01:33:30,490
I think it was radio lab where they're
talking about they were trying to

2115
01:33:30,491 --> 01:33:33,760
repopulate the whooping crane.
The whipping cream was like in danger of

2116
01:33:33,761 --> 01:33:36,760
extinction.
And one of the things that they had done

2117
01:33:36,761 --> 01:33:41,230
was they tried to come up with new
migration paths for these animals.

2118
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:44,020
I think I read something about that.
Well,

2119
01:33:44,021 --> 01:33:48,040
this lady had a bird feeders in her yard
and he's whooping cranes,

2120
01:33:48,041 --> 01:33:52,750
had come to her yard to use the bird
feeders and you know,

2121
01:33:52,751 --> 01:33:56,950
they were setting up these bird feeders
and interacting with them and the

2122
01:33:56,980 --> 01:34:01,980
scientists that had spent so much money
and so much time trying to engage these

2123
01:34:02,771 --> 01:34:05,590
whooping cranes into forming these new
migration pass.

2124
01:34:05,890 --> 01:34:07,660
We're trying to get her to stop doing
it,

2125
01:34:07,900 --> 01:34:11,530
trying to get her to stop feeding the
birds because these birds,

2126
01:34:11,550 --> 01:34:12,430
they will.
They don't want them.

2127
01:34:12,490 --> 01:34:15,160
They want them to be wild.
They don't want them to rely on people.

2128
01:34:15,161 --> 01:34:19,180
And also because these patterns were
predictable,

2129
01:34:19,210 --> 01:34:20,600
people would find them in the people
would.

2130
01:34:20,710 --> 01:34:22,560
Some people were shooting the whooping
cranes and should.

2131
01:34:22,561 --> 01:34:26,680
They had lost a few of them and it's bad
fucking ungodly amounts of money trying

2132
01:34:26,681 --> 01:34:31,360
to repopulate these birds,
but her husband had Alzheimer's like

2133
01:34:31,361 --> 01:34:35,320
real bad and the only thing that would
get them excited was birds.

2134
01:34:35,830 --> 01:34:38,790
So he would be out there with her and he
would see the birds.

2135
01:34:38,791 --> 01:34:39,640
He,
we'd all look,

2136
01:34:39,641 --> 01:34:40,660
look,
there he is right there.

2137
01:34:40,900 --> 01:34:43,720
And she said like for that brief moment,
while these birds were there,

2138
01:34:43,721 --> 01:34:46,900
he would be back and she'd be able to
engage them and talk to them,

2139
01:34:47,200 --> 01:34:50,260
but when the birds were gone,
he just drifted away right back.

2140
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:52,150
And he was gone.
And so she was like,

2141
01:34:52,151 --> 01:34:54,340
fuck you.
I'm hanging out with my husband with the

2142
01:34:54,341 --> 01:34:56,020
birds.
It was weird,

2143
01:34:56,021 --> 01:34:56,890
you know,
that's pretty.

2144
01:34:57,020 --> 01:34:57,853
Yeah.

2145
01:34:58,250 --> 01:34:59,810
It's actually kind of incredible.
I mean,

2146
01:35:00,290 --> 01:35:02,420
I remember like when my dad,
before he died,

2147
01:35:02,421 --> 01:35:04,450
this real fun story,
but my head,

2148
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:06,220
my mom was like,
you know,

2149
01:35:06,230 --> 01:35:07,970
just,
they were frustrated with each other.

2150
01:35:08,180 --> 01:35:10,880
You know,
he's just riddled with cancer.

2151
01:35:10,881 --> 01:35:13,730
She's trying to help.
He's pissed and they never fought.

2152
01:35:13,731 --> 01:35:16,490
They never ever.
So it was weird to see them that way.

2153
01:35:16,790 --> 01:35:19,580
But then if somebody came that he didn't
know,

2154
01:35:20,270 --> 01:35:24,140
he would come back like it was like,
you're a new person.

2155
01:35:24,470 --> 01:35:25,760
It's not the same shit.
You know,

2156
01:35:25,761 --> 01:35:28,010
like as soon as somebody brand new came
in,

2157
01:35:28,011 --> 01:35:30,080
like if it was a nurse or somebody that
he didn't know,

2158
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:33,380
I would watch him just immediately come
back,

2159
01:35:33,381 --> 01:35:36,410
you know,
like I don't know if he was trying to be

2160
01:35:36,411 --> 01:35:38,660
more hospitable or if it was like what
it was,

2161
01:35:38,661 --> 01:35:43,100
but just you would watch them just like,
it could just switch and he would be

2162
01:35:43,101 --> 01:35:43,450
nice.

2163
01:35:43,450 --> 01:35:46,420
Well I think novelty,
new things,

2164
01:35:46,421 --> 01:35:48,790
new new experiences,
new places,

2165
01:35:48,791 --> 01:35:52,690
all those things stimulate areas of our
brain that we kind of take for granted.

2166
01:35:53,350 --> 01:35:56,530
Like I like doing things that I suck at.
That's one of the things that I really

2167
01:35:56,531 --> 01:35:59,090
liked doing or like doing things that
I'm not good at it.

2168
01:35:59,100 --> 01:36:01,530
I'm new at them and because because I'm
new at,

2169
01:36:01,531 --> 01:36:04,490
am I getting obsessed with it like you
want to be good at,

2170
01:36:05,310 --> 01:36:09,430
but you're probably competitive to a
fault of issues.

2171
01:36:12,200 --> 01:36:14,380
I'll be sweating at a board game or
something.

2172
01:36:14,381 --> 01:36:17,980
Like just probably why it was real bad
when I was young.

2173
01:36:17,981 --> 01:36:21,520
I'm way better at it now way better
because now I understand what it is.

2174
01:36:21,640 --> 01:36:24,580
Back then I just,
I just would be overwhelmed by the demon

2175
01:36:24,970 --> 01:36:27,440
and I would just,
I just needed to win,

2176
01:36:27,700 --> 01:36:29,230
you know,
find a way to win.

2177
01:36:29,250 --> 01:36:31,690
Right.
But I'm just new things,

2178
01:36:31,691 --> 01:36:32,840
like even things that aren't
competitive.

2179
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:37,640
Well I guess archery can be competitive,
but I just do it like sort of as

2180
01:36:37,690 --> 01:36:39,410
practice.
But I'm obsessed with it.

2181
01:36:39,550 --> 01:36:43,990
I fucking it just because I suck at it
for whatever reason.

2182
01:36:43,991 --> 01:36:48,760
Like when I'm practicing it's just
becomes my entire focus and these new

2183
01:36:48,761 --> 01:36:50,650
things like that.
Like Yoga is another thing.

2184
01:36:50,651 --> 01:36:53,760
I fucking suck at it,
but I was doing it.

2185
01:36:53,770 --> 01:36:55,330
I can't do it.
How come you can't do it?

2186
01:36:56,110 --> 01:36:58,180
You only tried it once.
I'm not flexible.

2187
01:36:58,450 --> 01:37:00,130
Well that's because you got to stretch
what the fuck?

2188
01:37:00,131 --> 01:37:02,770
Kind of logic.
But I suck.

2189
01:37:02,771 --> 01:37:06,370
That's like saying yeah I tried playing
football but I'm not good at it.

2190
01:37:06,371 --> 01:37:08,500
But try to move around a lot more.

2191
01:37:09,150 --> 01:37:11,190
Okay.
So that's why you go really wasn't I

2192
01:37:11,191 --> 01:37:12,930
like feeling like I'm doing,
I like to go jog,

2193
01:37:12,931 --> 01:37:13,651
I liked,
you know,

2194
01:37:13,651 --> 01:37:15,840
like that's not enough moving about.

2195
01:37:16,430 --> 01:37:18,140
Yeah.
Well that's part of the whole practice

2196
01:37:18,141 --> 01:37:22,460
of it is practice being still holding
poses.

2197
01:37:23,420 --> 01:37:25,390
My point,
my point is I'm not good at it but.

2198
01:37:25,400 --> 01:37:27,650
So I'm obsessed with it so when I do it
I just,

2199
01:37:27,651 --> 01:37:31,260
it just becomes like this overwhelming
thing for me.

2200
01:37:31,261 --> 01:37:34,610
But I concentrate on it all the time and
I'll do it a couple days a week and for

2201
01:37:34,611 --> 01:37:37,040
the other days that I'm not doing,
I'm thinking about it a lot of time.

2202
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:39,890
That's interesting.
I think that's why I like,

2203
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:42,740
well I kind of stand up those up for me.
Oh yeah.

2204
01:37:42,830 --> 01:37:44,600
Stand up really does that for me because
I get,

2205
01:37:44,810 --> 01:37:46,400
I always get a little nervous before a
go,

2206
01:37:46,401 --> 01:37:49,220
you know,
like you and if it works,

2207
01:37:49,400 --> 01:37:51,590
you know,
and if it doesn't you figure out what

2208
01:37:51,591 --> 01:37:53,200
joke didn't work,
why it did,

2209
01:37:53,210 --> 01:37:54,900
you know,
you should scrap it,

2210
01:37:55,080 --> 01:37:56,100
change it.
Should I.

2211
01:37:56,100 --> 01:37:56,791
But I,
I,

2212
01:37:56,791 --> 01:38:00,180
that's one thing I really love about
standup is it does like Jeremy,

2213
01:38:00,210 --> 01:38:02,130
you know,
it makes me like,

2214
01:38:03,030 --> 01:38:05,040
you know,
like how you feel when you get off stage

2215
01:38:05,041 --> 01:38:07,860
and you're like all psyched up and shit.
Like I love that feeling of being

2216
01:38:07,861 --> 01:38:11,430
nervous and you know,
onstage and that always is very like

2217
01:38:11,550 --> 01:38:14,490
rewarding to me.
Stand was one of the few things is still

2218
01:38:14,491 --> 01:38:16,950
challenging in that way.
All these years later,

2219
01:38:16,951 --> 01:38:20,640
26 plus years later for me.
But it's also because I write new stuff.

2220
01:38:20,820 --> 01:38:23,310
That's the key is practicing new
material,

2221
01:38:24,360 --> 01:38:26,400
having new material,
constantly writing.

2222
01:38:26,430 --> 01:38:30,300
If you don't do that then you get
trapped and if you get trapped with an

2223
01:38:30,301 --> 01:38:34,650
act like we all know those older comics
that have been around for 50 fucking

2224
01:38:34,651 --> 01:38:37,290
years or whatever and they have that act
where they're doing like Reagan

2225
01:38:37,291 --> 01:38:38,620
impressions,
smoke issues,

2226
01:38:39,810 --> 01:38:41,150
Claritin,
claritin.

2227
01:38:41,430 --> 01:38:42,870
No,
it hasn't kicked in yet.

2228
01:38:43,470 --> 01:38:45,090
I took it on.
The way here are alerted to anything

2229
01:38:45,091 --> 01:38:45,751
else?
Cats,

2230
01:38:45,751 --> 01:38:46,590
dogs,
cheese,

2231
01:38:46,620 --> 01:38:47,540
milk,
nothing.

2232
01:38:47,860 --> 01:38:50,140
No.
Just flying through the air.

2233
01:38:50,260 --> 01:38:51,750
I don't even know what it is,
Huh?

2234
01:38:52,240 --> 01:38:52,711
No,
I know.

2235
01:38:52,711 --> 01:38:54,690
It's like a Paul.
Every time it rains,

2236
01:38:55,380 --> 01:38:57,320
that's when it happened.
So it's whatever's kicked up like

2237
01:38:57,330 --> 01:39:01,620
ragweed pollen is.
It's seasonal times a year.

2238
01:39:01,930 --> 01:39:04,020
Yeah.
Did you get it in Houston as well?

2239
01:39:04,430 --> 01:39:06,420
Huh?
Just different times a year in Houston

2240
01:39:06,450 --> 01:39:08,520
is different out here.
I've actually had a worse out here,

2241
01:39:08,521 --> 01:39:09,354
which is weird.

2242
01:39:10,810 --> 01:39:12,100
That is weird.
Yeah.

2243
01:39:12,101 --> 01:39:15,910
I don't know if it's the climate,
like I was in a really humid climate.

2244
01:39:15,911 --> 01:39:18,730
I don't know if there's just something
else maybe that I'm allergic to that I

2245
01:39:18,731 --> 01:39:21,400
don't know,
but I've noticed that because my eyes

2246
01:39:21,401 --> 01:39:22,660
get a little burn,
you know,

2247
01:39:22,661 --> 01:39:24,490
and I'll get like that,
you know,

2248
01:39:24,491 --> 01:39:28,000
that just real bread.
I could feel like everything's draining.

2249
01:39:28,750 --> 01:39:31,660
That's interesting because a lot of
people move to like dry desert climates

2250
01:39:31,661 --> 01:39:34,240
like Arizona to try to avoid.
Believe me,

2251
01:39:34,241 --> 01:39:35,140
I know,
it's weird.

2252
01:39:35,141 --> 01:39:38,590
I don't know what it is,
but it's been worse since I've been in

2253
01:39:38,591 --> 01:39:41,080
La.
So Houston in the summer is one of the

2254
01:39:41,081 --> 01:39:42,490
most bizarre environments.

2255
01:39:44,530 --> 01:39:46,920
You're just breathing water.
He like,

2256
01:39:47,230 --> 01:39:48,190
yeah,
everything's just.

2257
01:39:48,191 --> 01:39:49,100
It's wet.
Yeah.

2258
01:39:49,160 --> 01:39:50,540
Yeah.
I really feel like you could drain your

2259
01:39:51,070 --> 01:39:55,600
100 degrees and 100 percent humidity.
It's just the windows outside.

2260
01:39:55,601 --> 01:39:56,800
You Walk Up,
you're wearing sunglasses,

2261
01:39:56,801 --> 01:39:59,860
they fog up and everything.
Your your sunglasses fog up,

2262
01:39:59,861 --> 01:40:02,110
your.
Your clothes instantly stick to you.

2263
01:40:02,720 --> 01:40:05,740
Like to concerts.
We'll start filming a flimsy.

2264
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:07,890
It could be at one of those like stiff,
you know,

2265
01:40:07,900 --> 01:40:09,760
t shirts.
All of a sudden it's real flimsy.

2266
01:40:09,780 --> 01:40:14,110
It stuck to you,
but it's really good for your skin.

2267
01:40:14,980 --> 01:40:15,813
Is it?
Yeah.

2268
01:40:15,880 --> 01:40:18,070
Chicks to young looking for a long time
out there.

2269
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:22,960
Just stay where they're moist.
Facially

2270
01:40:24,490 --> 01:40:28,640
skin was don't mean the other way.
Moist.

2271
01:40:30,760 --> 01:40:33,310
Your skin,
your facial skin stays moist.

2272
01:40:33,850 --> 01:40:34,870
Does that make sense?
My line,

2273
01:40:34,900 --> 01:40:36,580
my bacon things.
I use lotion.

2274
01:40:36,790 --> 01:40:37,630
Yeah.
Well that helps too.

2275
01:40:37,680 --> 01:40:38,740
Yeah,
that's a good move.

2276
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:39,633
Yeah,
I do that,

2277
01:40:40,120 --> 01:40:41,950
but I think that uh,
the environment,

2278
01:40:41,951 --> 01:40:44,830
like the dry air environment is bad for
your skin.

2279
01:40:47,060 --> 01:40:50,480
It definitely is because I know like
when those moments during the summertime

2280
01:40:50,481 --> 01:40:54,190
out here when it's just fucking that
just gnarly heat,

2281
01:40:54,191 --> 01:40:57,250
that desert heat heat.
Oh my God.

2282
01:40:57,251 --> 01:40:59,950
And it's like,
my skin is like drinking the lotion that

2283
01:40:59,951 --> 01:41:03,400
I've put on it.
It's like how my skin already dried out

2284
01:41:03,401 --> 01:41:03,971
again,
you know,

2285
01:41:03,971 --> 01:41:06,490
like you're just sitting there just.
It's pretty,

2286
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:08,193
pretty.
Not Fun.

2287
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:10,840
But I like it out here better.

2288
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:14,250
What do you like about here?
But more open minded more.

2289
01:41:14,300 --> 01:41:14,970
Oh No,

2290
01:41:14,970 --> 01:41:15,803
smart.
Do.

2291
01:41:15,830 --> 01:41:16,663
Oh,
you know,

2292
01:41:16,740 --> 01:41:20,040
I like doing all the standup stuff and
writing and it's different because I

2293
01:41:20,041 --> 01:41:21,050
moved out here.
Yeah.

2294
01:41:21,060 --> 01:41:24,480
Career wise.
So I love my career so that makes it,

2295
01:41:24,840 --> 01:41:25,510
you know.
So.

2296
01:41:25,510 --> 01:41:27,660
And plus the weather's usually always
nice out here.

2297
01:41:27,930 --> 01:41:30,720
I liked the beaches,
I like to surf.

2298
01:41:30,721 --> 01:41:32,460
I like to,
you know,

2299
01:41:32,760 --> 01:41:34,560
it's fun.
There's two things I don't like out

2300
01:41:34,561 --> 01:41:35,460
here.
One,

2301
01:41:35,461 --> 01:41:36,880
the overpopulation.
Yeah,

2302
01:41:36,930 --> 01:41:38,550
it's ridiculously over.
Traffic sucks.

2303
01:41:38,640 --> 01:41:42,870
Traffic sucks that stuff and to.
There's.

2304
01:41:43,510 --> 01:41:45,720
Go ahead.
She's,

2305
01:41:46,020 --> 01:41:46,650
she's

2306
01:41:46,650 --> 01:41:48,090
tucking away.
No,

2307
01:41:48,091 --> 01:41:50,820
I'm just like throwing all my fucking
tissues.

2308
01:41:51,120 --> 01:41:55,320
It's really impressive that the um,
the other thing is there's this

2309
01:41:55,380 --> 01:41:58,050
disingenuous aspect of the entertainment
industry.

2310
01:41:58,320 --> 01:42:01,620
This is shallow,
weird sort of actor.

2311
01:42:01,680 --> 01:42:05,820
He thing that I think is a product of
people having to audition.

2312
01:42:06,090 --> 01:42:08,910
So you're constantly having to get
people to like you,

2313
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:13,500
so you put on this sort of fake behavior
and then you become a part of whatever

2314
01:42:13,501 --> 01:42:18,450
click or whatever pattern that you think
is like in the vogue in popular,

2315
01:42:18,750 --> 01:42:20,850
you know,
like how many people called Caitlyn

2316
01:42:20,850 --> 01:42:22,690
Jenner a hero and you know,
like it's,

2317
01:42:23,040 --> 01:42:23,851
you know,
you're in,

2318
01:42:23,851 --> 01:42:26,240
you're in with the right,
the right sensibilities to.

2319
01:42:26,241 --> 01:42:27,074
Right.
You know?

2320
01:42:27,680 --> 01:42:29,070
Yeah.
Even on your head,

2321
01:42:29,071 --> 01:42:31,200
you could be like,
with Kony 2012.

2322
01:42:31,201 --> 01:42:36,201
I mean there was like this fucking Kony
2012 where everybody fucking jumped on

2323
01:42:36,241 --> 01:42:36,691
board.
I'm like,

2324
01:42:36,691 --> 01:42:39,960
do you even know what the fuck you have
a bumper sticker for?

2325
01:42:39,961 --> 01:42:42,960
Do you know that?
I still Hashtag that Kony 2012,

2326
01:42:42,961 --> 01:42:45,840
but I'll do it on something that makes
absolutely no sense.

2327
01:42:46,300 --> 01:42:49,500
It's just about World Dick joke and I
always put Kony 2012.

2328
01:42:52,130 --> 01:42:53,660
I'm like,
I'm not going to let it die,

2329
01:42:53,661 --> 01:42:56,520
but it's going to keep.
I don't want it to stay relevant.

2330
01:42:56,521 --> 01:42:59,520
Kony 2012.
That's one of my favorite all time human

2331
01:42:59,521 --> 01:43:01,710
folly stories.
Because the guy who started that whole

2332
01:43:01,711 --> 01:43:03,330
movement meltdown he had.
Oh,

2333
01:43:03,331 --> 01:43:05,460
it was amazing.
It was so good.

2334
01:43:05,461 --> 01:43:08,060
That was true.
That was true meltdowns.

2335
01:43:08,820 --> 01:43:13,820
I think he was probably completely
insane before he started the pressure of

2336
01:43:14,131 --> 01:43:17,730
the success of the movement.
Like somehow or another this guy got

2337
01:43:17,731 --> 01:43:22,470
celebrities and all these world famous
people were on board because it became

2338
01:43:22,500 --> 01:43:24,630
the cause detour,
you know,

2339
01:43:25,140 --> 01:43:28,260
it was the thing.
It was the flavor of the month.

2340
01:43:28,261 --> 01:43:32,340
I mean he like how long did it last?
So I'm trying to think quite a while.

2341
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:33,690
Six months,
maybe six.

2342
01:43:33,691 --> 01:43:34,860
I'm okay.
Something like that.

2343
01:43:35,010 --> 01:43:36,690
But it was amazing.
Yeah.

2344
01:43:36,691 --> 01:43:39,210
Every celebrity was on board wearing
their tee shirt.

2345
01:43:39,780 --> 01:43:42,240
Kony 2012.
So many bumper stickers.

2346
01:43:42,350 --> 01:43:46,050
Oh my God.
One day jerking off in front of people

2347
01:43:46,260 --> 01:43:49,070
running around the street with your
pants down screen.

2348
01:43:49,080 --> 01:43:52,100
Completely naked.
Just on a corner.

2349
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:54,230
And I like,
I Kony 2012.

2350
01:43:54,380 --> 01:43:55,970
Don't forget,
don't forget.

2351
01:43:55,971 --> 01:43:57,770
Blessed.
Blessed.

2352
01:43:58,010 --> 01:44:00,580
And it ended.
It ended like that.

2353
01:44:00,920 --> 01:44:02,030
Like that.
That's all it took.

2354
01:44:02,390 --> 01:44:05,390
It was like people talked a little bit
about the meltdown and then it was like

2355
01:44:05,391 --> 01:44:08,720
something else happened.
We never heard like who knows what that

2356
01:44:08,721 --> 01:44:12,590
guy's doing right now,
but to me that embodies the disingenuous

2357
01:44:12,620 --> 01:44:16,610
aspect of a lot of the Hollywood like
activism type behavior.

2358
01:44:16,611 --> 01:44:19,820
It's like I don't necessarily think
they're really interested in the

2359
01:44:19,821 --> 01:44:22,850
activism as much as they're interested
in people thinking they're interested in

2360
01:44:22,851 --> 01:44:25,880
the activism.
They're trying to put together a

2361
01:44:25,881 --> 01:44:27,170
package,
you know,

2362
01:44:27,171 --> 01:44:29,060
and that package is how you look,
how you dress,

2363
01:44:29,061 --> 01:44:29,894
how you act,
how you behave,

2364
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:32,750
and you have to have liberal
sensibilities because you want to be

2365
01:44:32,751 --> 01:44:36,110
fucking cast so you have to,
you have to connect with these people

2366
01:44:36,111 --> 01:44:37,160
that have the casting agents.

2367
01:44:37,160 --> 01:44:40,400
You can't have,
you can't be outrageous in,

2368
01:44:40,410 --> 01:44:43,320
in any way that's non.
So again,

2369
01:44:43,420 --> 01:44:47,840
don't know if you say you're like,
who's that says Rob Schneider.

2370
01:44:47,870 --> 01:44:49,760
Somebody said he was a republican.
It was he,

2371
01:44:50,230 --> 01:44:53,030
I think he said it,
but it was just lays up fucking vaccine

2372
01:44:53,031 --> 01:44:54,710
denier and he's carrying a lot of weird
shit.

2373
01:44:55,330 --> 01:44:57,170
But it's like if you.
That's not liberal,

2374
01:44:57,171 --> 01:44:59,480
you know,
like kind of I guess the vaccine.

2375
01:45:00,050 --> 01:45:02,290
There's a lot of vaccine deniers,
really liberal,

2376
01:45:02,690 --> 01:45:05,780
but it's such a weird thing that if you
do something that's not the norm out

2377
01:45:05,781 --> 01:45:07,280
here,
everyone just treats you like a bag of

2378
01:45:07,281 --> 01:45:09,750
shit and you're like,
yeah,

2379
01:45:09,830 --> 01:45:12,710
I don't feel like I don't have that
problem because I'm not an actor.

2380
01:45:13,540 --> 01:45:17,120
I'm a writer and I do stand up.
But also I don't know if it's because I

2381
01:45:17,121 --> 01:45:22,070
moved out here.
I'm 37 so I didn't move out here at 19

2382
01:45:22,071 --> 01:45:25,230
starry eyed with five roommates and
inefficiency,

2383
01:45:25,250 --> 01:45:27,890
you know,
like I'm super vulnerable to other

2384
01:45:27,891 --> 01:45:28,440
ideas.

2385
01:45:28,440 --> 01:45:30,690
I've been working.
I have a stock portfolio.

2386
01:45:30,691 --> 01:45:35,691
I bought a house so I didn't really give
a shit the way that I think that if you

2387
01:45:35,811 --> 01:45:38,690
come out here so early you're totally
affected by it.

2388
01:45:39,050 --> 01:45:41,180
Yeah.
Well I've met a lot of people that were

2389
01:45:41,181 --> 01:45:44,270
really young when they came out here and
I met them young when they were out

2390
01:45:44,271 --> 01:45:46,310
here.
Like I did a show once back in the day

2391
01:45:46,311 --> 01:45:50,930
with this guy who was an actor and he
was like 22 and he was this handsome guy

2392
01:45:51,140 --> 01:45:55,640
and he was trying so hard to fucking be
the that God,

2393
01:45:56,120 --> 01:45:57,770
you know,
and we were talking about.

2394
01:45:57,920 --> 01:46:01,100
Do you remember that Jack Nicholson
movie with um,

2395
01:46:01,340 --> 01:46:03,860
Helen Hunt thing is called as good as it
gets?

2396
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:06,500
Yeah.
I fucking hated that movie.

2397
01:46:06,890 --> 01:46:10,530
I hated that movie with every fiber of
my being and one of the reasons why I

2398
01:46:10,531 --> 01:46:14,480
hated it because I felt sad that this
woman who's a single mom and she seemed

2399
01:46:14,481 --> 01:46:18,740
really nice and Jack Nicholson's a piece
of shit and asshole and she's stuck with

2400
01:46:18,741 --> 01:46:20,600
them and this is as good as you get.

2401
01:46:21,050 --> 01:46:24,470
That was the whole idea of it.
And then this is fucking ridiculous idea

2402
01:46:24,471 --> 01:46:27,080
that he was racist because he needed
medication.

2403
01:46:27,320 --> 01:46:29,480
So they gave him medication.
He stopped being racist,

2404
01:46:29,481 --> 01:46:32,210
like what the fuck kind of movie is I
guess grows.

2405
01:46:32,450 --> 01:46:35,690
And so he and I were having this
conversation because it was the movie

2406
01:46:35,691 --> 01:46:37,600
that everybody enjoy.
Everyone did she,

2407
01:46:38,230 --> 01:46:39,320
it was amazing.
Yeah.

2408
01:46:39,321 --> 01:46:43,010
She wanted an Oscar for it and so he and
I were having this conversation.

2409
01:46:43,011 --> 01:46:47,240
He was doing that thing that they do
where if it is something that everybody

2410
01:46:47,241 --> 01:46:49,010
likes,
he likes it and,

2411
01:46:49,350 --> 01:46:51,030
and I go,
I fucking hated that movie.

2412
01:46:51,060 --> 01:46:51,930
And he's like,
why?

2413
01:46:52,350 --> 01:46:53,760
He goes,
it's amazing movie.

2414
01:46:53,820 --> 01:46:54,810
I go,
is amazing.

2415
01:46:54,960 --> 01:46:56,560
I go,
what the fuck is cheese?

2416
01:46:56,580 --> 01:46:59,400
This poor woman was this kid and he says
old cut.

2417
01:46:59,580 --> 01:47:03,090
And she stuck with them and he was
getting any better.

2418
01:47:03,090 --> 01:47:04,950
So she'd rather sickly kid be around
that.

2419
01:47:05,160 --> 01:47:07,330
Yeah.
Creepy dude with sunglasses on.

2420
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:10,050
So he goes,
actually,

2421
01:47:10,051 --> 01:47:11,820
I thought he had a lot to offer.
I go,

2422
01:47:11,821 --> 01:47:13,020
what?
What did you just say?

2423
01:47:13,460 --> 01:47:15,300
He had a lot to offer what but
breathing.

2424
01:47:15,301 --> 01:47:18,260
He's my hanging around her money and she
didn't what it that mean?

2425
01:47:18,730 --> 01:47:20,430
It's like the whole.
Yeah,

2426
01:47:20,520 --> 01:47:22,830
the purpose of that movie was
disgusting,

2427
01:47:23,070 --> 01:47:25,650
but when I had this conversation with
him about it,

2428
01:47:25,651 --> 01:47:29,940
it became clear really early on when I
started chipping away at it,

2429
01:47:29,941 --> 01:47:32,600
like,
what was it that got you about the movie

2430
01:47:32,601 --> 01:47:33,730
where it would,
would,

2431
01:47:33,780 --> 01:47:35,520
would go well,
but got him.

2432
01:47:35,521 --> 01:47:36,960
Is it everybody?
Was saying they liked it,

2433
01:47:37,380 --> 01:47:39,660
everybody said they liked it.
So you wanted to say he liked it.

2434
01:47:39,661 --> 01:47:42,990
So he was just wracking his brain for.
What was that one thing that person said

2435
01:47:43,080 --> 01:47:43,530
about it?

2436
01:47:43,530 --> 01:47:45,960
He's an interesting case because he,
he got real,

2437
01:47:46,200 --> 01:47:48,960
real hot real quick,
like people were really into them.

2438
01:47:48,961 --> 01:47:51,990
But then they found out he was Kinda
dumb and it just drifted away.

2439
01:47:52,060 --> 01:47:54,960
It just ended.
So I thought that was okay in Hollywood

2440
01:47:55,320 --> 01:47:58,220
you can only be so dumb.
He was real super dumb.

2441
01:47:58,780 --> 01:48:02,310
There's a lot of people that they get
like a little bit of juice in the

2442
01:48:02,311 --> 01:48:04,950
beginning and like wow,
it's really starting to happen,

2443
01:48:05,090 --> 01:48:07,320
should I not?
And then the juice cuts off.

2444
01:48:07,380 --> 01:48:09,780
Sure.
And then some new one with maybe better

2445
01:48:09,781 --> 01:48:12,200
cheeks or something.
I mean everybody has their moments and

2446
01:48:12,201 --> 01:48:16,200
getting hot and then cold and you know,
you hope if you get cold you get hot,

2447
01:48:16,201 --> 01:48:18,420
you know?
Yeah.

2448
01:48:18,421 --> 01:48:22,410
But
it's really fucking stupid.

2449
01:48:22,411 --> 01:48:25,230
I don't know,
like during that whole Chris Brown

2450
01:48:25,231 --> 01:48:27,680
thing,
that's my only like examples.

2451
01:48:27,700 --> 01:48:32,700
Of course I was getting invited to be on
shows and talk about it and I declined

2452
01:48:32,790 --> 01:48:33,330
everything.

2453
01:48:33,330 --> 01:48:34,320
It was like,
no,

2454
01:48:34,321 --> 01:48:35,850
I'm not good for you.
I was like,

2455
01:48:35,851 --> 01:48:37,620
absolutely not.
I wasn't the Chris Brown things.

2456
01:48:37,650 --> 01:48:41,730
We talked about it before the podcast,
but if people don't know Chris Brown

2457
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:46,680
obviously was in trouble because of beat
up or Yana and that whole thing and you

2458
01:48:46,681 --> 01:48:49,560
know,
the domestic violence issue and you

2459
01:48:49,800 --> 01:48:51,960
tweeted something at him.
What did you tweet?

2460
01:48:51,990 --> 01:48:55,380
Well,
it was like my lowest form of comedy.

2461
01:48:55,381 --> 01:48:58,890
Writing is the celebrity reach weight.
It's because I can't think of anything

2462
01:48:58,891 --> 01:49:03,891
else and I'll just go to my favorite
targets like camera Kim Kardashians and

2463
01:49:04,081 --> 01:49:06,000
I only make fun of when they write
something stupid.

2464
01:49:06,001 --> 01:49:07,500
I never,
I never ever,

2465
01:49:07,501 --> 01:49:10,780
like I've never talked about some of
these looks their weight there,

2466
01:49:10,880 --> 01:49:13,020
you know,
like it's just something dumb.

2467
01:49:13,530 --> 01:49:15,360
And with his,
you know what he did,

2468
01:49:15,361 --> 01:49:18,630
he's a horrible person and he had showed
no signs of remorse.

2469
01:49:18,630 --> 01:49:22,290
Like he kept doing shit.
He threw a chair through the window and

2470
01:49:22,291 --> 01:49:24,470
good morning America and Robert and
Robert's interviews.

2471
01:49:24,870 --> 01:49:25,560
Yeah.
Well,

2472
01:49:25,560 --> 01:49:28,770
I mean like asking him about it and
apparently they had made some sort of an

2473
01:49:28,771 --> 01:49:31,210
agreement where they weren't going to
bring up with domestic violence.

2474
01:49:31,350 --> 01:49:34,140
I'm here to talk about my album,
but the whole thing is,

2475
01:49:34,141 --> 01:49:37,530
it's like how he channeled his rage,
throwing a chair through a fucking

2476
01:49:37,550 --> 01:49:42,550
window really couldn't.
So I was born child and so I was born

2477
01:49:43,231 --> 01:49:45,840
and he had tweeted something like,
man,

2478
01:49:45,841 --> 01:49:47,950
I look old as fuck and I'm only 23.

2479
01:49:48,470 --> 01:49:51,400
And so I retweeted it and I was like,
I know being a worthless piece of shit

2480
01:49:51,401 --> 01:49:55,570
can really age.
I thought it was funny and then all of a

2481
01:49:55,571 --> 01:50:00,571
sudden like I look at my replies on my
phone and it will look like that

2482
01:50:02,170 --> 01:50:04,930
waterfall of just like,
all of a sudden it was like a thousand

2483
01:50:04,931 --> 01:50:05,830
$2,000.
I'm like,

2484
01:50:05,860 --> 01:50:07,810
Holy Shit,
whoops.

2485
01:50:07,990 --> 01:50:10,570
What did I do?
And then I realized he was coming back,

2486
01:50:11,550 --> 01:50:14,230
like Gino telling me to suck his dick.
I'm like,

2487
01:50:14,231 --> 01:50:15,430
no,
your mother must be so.

2488
01:50:15,431 --> 01:50:16,870
But like I just,
I played with them.

2489
01:50:17,300 --> 01:50:18,490
It was a Sunday.
I was bored.

2490
01:50:18,491 --> 01:50:23,180
And like next thing I know is like he
deleted his entire twitter account and

2491
01:50:23,210 --> 01:50:26,990
I'm like wow,
that's not what I meant to say.

2492
01:50:27,050 --> 01:50:30,880
One of the shit in your mouth too sharp
in my eye.

2493
01:50:31,150 --> 01:50:36,150
Your eye retina to be your specific.

2494
01:50:36,280 --> 01:50:37,960
I don't know.
I think he was trying to sound smart

2495
01:50:37,961 --> 01:50:40,720
beam accuracy.
Does he have with his is even the back

2496
01:50:40,721 --> 01:50:41,371
of the eye.
It's on,

2497
01:50:41,371 --> 01:50:43,490
in the front.
Like he didn't even think.

2498
01:50:43,491 --> 01:50:46,720
It's just trying to sound smart and I on
your retina.

2499
01:50:46,790 --> 01:50:51,790
I was just laughing away and I like he
said like ask Rhiannon if she mad.

2500
01:50:52,331 --> 01:50:57,331
I'm like ask Ryanna if she man.
So like I tweeted back and then I linked

2501
01:50:57,731 --> 01:51:02,731
his police report to that tweet is a.
I thought it was funny and we went back

2502
01:51:04,031 --> 01:51:07,350
and forth for awhile and then he deleted
his account and that's when it became a

2503
01:51:07,660 --> 01:51:09,130
thing.
Did he put it back up?

2504
01:51:09,150 --> 01:51:09,983
Is this.
It was,

2505
01:51:10,560 --> 01:51:12,700
yeah,
it wasn't really like down for like a

2506
01:51:12,700 --> 01:51:14,410
couple of weeks or something like that.
You delete your account when you put it

2507
01:51:14,411 --> 01:51:15,670
back to you get all your followers back.

2508
01:51:15,700 --> 01:51:17,800
Do you have to start from scratch now?
You just start from scratch,

2509
01:51:18,420 --> 01:51:21,280
but I.
He has the most insane,

2510
01:51:21,580 --> 01:51:26,580
Loyal Group of idiots that follow him.
Just misspelled death threats all day

2511
01:51:28,031 --> 01:51:30,310
long is what I got was just misspelled
death threats.

2512
01:51:31,710 --> 01:51:32,590
I was like,
well,

2513
01:51:32,990 --> 01:51:33,761
you know,
whoops.

2514
01:51:33,761 --> 01:51:37,360
But then the next day I was like,
my manager,

2515
01:51:37,361 --> 01:51:38,950
like I love the call that I got.
She's like,

2516
01:51:38,951 --> 01:51:40,720
Jenny,
what did you do?

2517
01:51:41,710 --> 01:51:43,780
A lot of messages here.
And I was like,

2518
01:51:43,781 --> 01:51:44,820
yeah,
no,

2519
01:51:44,830 --> 01:51:48,190
my bad was like,
just tell them all no.

2520
01:51:48,640 --> 01:51:49,890
And she's like,
okay.

2521
01:51:49,891 --> 01:51:51,240
And she goes,
are you sure you don't want to?

2522
01:51:51,320 --> 01:51:53,560
I've got good ones to view Larry King.
I'll.

2523
01:51:53,561 --> 01:51:55,210
I was like,
no view was a good one.

2524
01:51:55,211 --> 01:51:56,790
How hilarious.
She was laughing.

2525
01:51:56,920 --> 01:52:00,640
She was totally not promoting this and
she's got some good ones I want you to

2526
01:52:00,641 --> 01:52:01,720
be on.
We got Larry King,

2527
01:52:01,721 --> 01:52:02,980
we got the view and I was like,
no,

2528
01:52:02,981 --> 01:52:03,731
no,
no,

2529
01:52:03,731 --> 01:52:04,180
no,
no.

2530
01:52:04,180 --> 01:52:06,640
I don't want to do it because I didn't
want to.

2531
01:52:06,700 --> 01:52:09,850
That's not my intention.
It was just so happened.

2532
01:52:09,851 --> 01:52:12,400
That's something that I thought he
wasn't going to take.

2533
01:52:12,700 --> 01:52:13,670
They get pissed about,
like,

2534
01:52:13,710 --> 01:52:17,080
that ended up being something and it
wasn't how I wanted to make my,

2535
01:52:17,480 --> 01:52:18,670
yeah,
self known,

2536
01:52:18,671 --> 01:52:19,504
you know,
and I just,

2537
01:52:19,750 --> 01:52:21,370
at that point I already had like,
you know,

2538
01:52:21,430 --> 01:52:23,650
300,000 followers.
It wasn't like I didn't.

2539
01:52:24,530 --> 01:52:26,050
Yeah,
it was just starting out and I was

2540
01:52:26,051 --> 01:52:28,900
trying to get fame or something off of
it,

2541
01:52:28,901 --> 01:52:33,100
but you doing what you do.
I was doing what I do and it went

2542
01:52:33,730 --> 01:52:37,540
somewhere that I didn't ask.
I was like,

2543
01:52:37,541 --> 01:52:38,410
ah,
yeah,

2544
01:52:38,440 --> 01:52:39,340
no,
I don't want to do that.

2545
01:52:39,341 --> 01:52:42,430
And I think about it and like I wonder
if people would.

2546
01:52:42,550 --> 01:52:44,860
Somebody said something one time,
did that bother you that that was when

2547
01:52:44,861 --> 01:52:45,710
you hot?

2548
01:52:45,920 --> 01:52:46,701
I was like,
no,

2549
01:52:46,701 --> 01:52:48,590
that is not when I was a hot maybe to
you.

2550
01:52:48,740 --> 01:52:52,190
To me that was like,
the low was be like dipping,

2551
01:52:52,660 --> 01:52:53,780
you know.
No,

2552
01:52:53,781 --> 01:52:57,170
it was not my finest hour.
I was not proud of that moment at all.

2553
01:52:57,171 --> 01:52:58,490
I don't regret it,
but I don't.

2554
01:52:58,940 --> 01:53:02,870
I'm certainly not going to go sit on the
show and talk about how wonderful I am.

2555
01:53:03,070 --> 01:53:03,711
It's like,
no,

2556
01:53:03,711 --> 01:53:06,620
I look at what I wrote.
I called it like a fucking ignorant

2557
01:53:06,621 --> 01:53:11,300
fucking
that Rosa parks.

2558
01:53:11,330 --> 01:53:14,150
Just something near like some heroes,
like no,

2559
01:53:14,151 --> 01:53:16,730
he was a piece of shit and I was just,
I like acknowledging that.

2560
01:53:17,540 --> 01:53:18,410
Yeah,
that's it.

2561
01:53:18,530 --> 01:53:22,790
I wish I knew what happened with them.
I know he beat her and I know you should

2562
01:53:22,791 --> 01:53:25,190
never beat.
You shouldn't beat anybody.

2563
01:53:25,370 --> 01:53:27,080
You definitely shouldn't beat someone
you love.

2564
01:53:27,110 --> 01:53:28,970
You definitely shouldn't be the girl if
you're a guy.

2565
01:53:29,390 --> 01:53:31,300
But I want to know what she did.
No,

2566
01:53:31,310 --> 01:53:32,750
she might have punched him in the face
too.

2567
01:53:32,751 --> 01:53:34,410
And he punched her back or.
Well,

2568
01:53:34,420 --> 01:53:37,070
I mean the whole police report is like,
you know,

2569
01:53:37,071 --> 01:53:39,440
which he,
he actually acknowledged at all was she

2570
01:53:39,441 --> 01:53:43,040
took his phone and there was another
chick texting and she was like,

2571
01:53:43,041 --> 01:53:43,910
what the fuck,
you know,

2572
01:53:44,060 --> 01:53:46,730
but they're driving and then he punched
her in the mouth and then just kept

2573
01:53:46,731 --> 01:53:49,700
punching or driving around.
It was like a 30 minute torture session.

2574
01:53:49,701 --> 01:53:50,920
Like what?
Yeah,

2575
01:53:50,930 --> 01:53:55,580
like he beat her head until it says and
dot whatever her actual last name is.

2576
01:53:55,590 --> 01:53:57,770
Her mouth filled with blood tooth
chipped a.

2577
01:53:58,370 --> 01:54:01,190
So he doesn't hit him at all now.
She didn't hit him at all.

2578
01:54:01,191 --> 01:54:02,900
She kept trying to get out of the car
and.

2579
01:54:03,210 --> 01:54:06,260
But then they break up.
Of course she got a restraining order

2580
01:54:06,261 --> 01:54:09,470
and then when that ended she got back
together with him.

2581
01:54:09,710 --> 01:54:11,820
Probably give some good Dick.
I guess.

2582
01:54:11,830 --> 01:54:14,150
So.
I mean I guess

2583
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:19,130
I don't know if she forgave him.
Shouldn't,

2584
01:54:19,131 --> 01:54:20,750
maybe shouldn't have been fucking with
his phone.

2585
01:54:21,530 --> 01:54:23,300
Maybe she should have kept her hands
where they belong.

2586
01:54:23,780 --> 01:54:28,780
Not on his phone,
but that was such a like,

2587
01:54:29,450 --> 01:54:31,380
I mean it was such a,
you know,

2588
01:54:31,630 --> 01:54:33,770
when I started getting all I'm like,
oh my God,

2589
01:54:34,130 --> 01:54:36,260
my mom is going to like read the shit
that I wrote.

2590
01:54:36,570 --> 01:54:40,580
Like I was more just going on.
That was your daughter and that guy was

2591
01:54:40,581 --> 01:54:43,940
hitting your daughter
and then just,

2592
01:54:44,060 --> 01:54:45,730
Oh,
I'm getting back together with him.

2593
01:54:46,080 --> 01:54:48,260
Yeah.
I just,

2594
01:54:49,010 --> 01:54:50,310
who knows,
man,

2595
01:54:50,690 --> 01:54:52,820
who knows what the fuck.
They're really luck or what she's really

2596
01:54:52,821 --> 01:54:54,560
like.
She's obviously a little crazy too.

2597
01:54:54,650 --> 01:54:56,900
Yeah.
I mean she'd have to be like a little.

2598
01:54:58,380 --> 01:55:00,770
But I think people that are that
talented are just fucking crazy.

2599
01:55:00,770 --> 01:55:03,260
Anyway.
Remember her,

2600
01:55:03,261 --> 01:55:04,400
who's talented?
Her.

2601
01:55:04,520 --> 01:55:06,230
She's very talented.
Her voice.

2602
01:55:06,710 --> 01:55:08,780
Yeah.
But a lot of people can say you don't

2603
01:55:08,781 --> 01:55:11,060
think she's talented?
Well,

2604
01:55:11,061 --> 01:55:13,880
it's just because I think she's,
she saw him for getting back together

2605
01:55:13,970 --> 01:55:14,391
with them.
You know,

2606
01:55:14,391 --> 01:55:16,130
like,
I have a hard time getting past that.

2607
01:55:16,131 --> 01:55:18,470
I don't,
but I don't even listen to new music

2608
01:55:18,471 --> 01:55:19,000
anyway.
I'm like,

2609
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:20,900
sit down with an old person driving
around,

2610
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:24,340
listening to lithium.
Serious.

2611
01:55:25,020 --> 01:55:26,950
That's.
Do what do you listen?

2612
01:55:26,960 --> 01:55:28,220
Like what's,
what's your kind of music?

2613
01:55:28,550 --> 01:55:29,840
I'm not kidding you.
That's probably it.

2614
01:55:29,841 --> 01:55:32,900
I listened to that eighties,
nineties first wave.

2615
01:55:33,490 --> 01:55:35,970
You're like Pandora or Nirvana fan?
Uh,

2616
01:55:35,971 --> 01:55:38,760
I like Nirvana already soaked in bleach.
I did.

2617
01:55:38,770 --> 01:55:40,820
I didn't really care for it.
What'd you think about it?

2618
01:55:40,880 --> 01:55:42,230
I didn't like it.
The movie,

2619
01:55:42,320 --> 01:55:44,190
the documentary that thinks that
Courtney

2620
01:55:44,190 --> 01:55:45,540
love out.
Pardon?

2621
01:55:45,700 --> 01:55:46,680
Kurt?
Purveyance death.

2622
01:55:46,740 --> 01:55:50,730
I've seen how many documentaries are
there about him?

2623
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:52,170
There's a few.
There's a lot.

2624
01:55:52,320 --> 01:55:54,570
There's a,
there's some real shitty ones.

2625
01:55:54,571 --> 01:55:55,950
The HBO One,
right?

2626
01:55:55,990 --> 01:55:57,240
Yeah.
Montage of heck.

2627
01:55:57,440 --> 01:56:01,530
I didn't see the reenactment crap.
That was terrible.

2628
01:56:02,720 --> 01:56:04,500
I was out.
I couldn't finish it actually because

2629
01:56:04,501 --> 01:56:06,810
I'm like,
I can't watch bad acting.

2630
01:56:06,811 --> 01:56:11,811
Like I thought it was a documentary and
if I'm watching actors pretend to be and

2631
01:56:12,571 --> 01:56:14,550
it's somebody else's version of it,
you know,

2632
01:56:14,551 --> 01:56:15,630
it,
it felt

2633
01:56:17,520 --> 01:56:18,353
like,
no.

2634
01:56:18,460 --> 01:56:20,850
Yeah,
I agree with you in that sense.

2635
01:56:20,880 --> 01:56:23,760
But I don't think they had rights to
anything else.

2636
01:56:23,880 --> 01:56:26,820
I think she owns the rights to Kurt,
you know,

2637
01:56:26,970 --> 01:56:30,390
so like I don't think they could do
anything else if they wanted to show

2638
01:56:30,391 --> 01:56:33,810
that movie and depict those stories and
how do you just not do it?

2639
01:56:34,440 --> 01:56:36,390
Well then they just write a book.

2640
01:56:37,430 --> 01:56:42,430
The problem is people won't read books
and another problem is if you want

2641
01:56:43,200 --> 01:56:47,520
people to pay attention,
you would have to listen to her actual

2642
01:56:47,521 --> 01:56:52,080
voice saying a bunch of crazy shit which
is in that documentary when you hear her

2643
01:56:52,081 --> 01:56:56,970
actual voice lying about like having a
drug overdose and making these publicity

2644
01:56:56,971 --> 01:57:01,320
stunts and lying to him about where she
found the suicide note or you know,

2645
01:57:01,321 --> 01:57:04,230
when she said she found it under the bed
or under the pillows and he's like,

2646
01:57:04,231 --> 01:57:06,420
well here's the problem with that.
I checked other pillows.

2647
01:57:06,421 --> 01:57:08,400
We chucked under all the pills.
We checked on there everything.

2648
01:57:08,401 --> 01:57:10,800
We scoured that room and she said,
yeah.

2649
01:57:10,801 --> 01:57:15,570
I says like what?
Like when you hear that and then when

2650
01:57:15,571 --> 01:57:20,571
you see the actual physical evidence of
her copying Kurt cobain's handwriting

2651
01:57:21,180 --> 01:57:24,480
and then you see the difference between
the suicide note,

2652
01:57:24,481 --> 01:57:28,500
which is three mostly like seven,
eight suicide note is him talking about

2653
01:57:28,501 --> 01:57:29,610
non related stuff.

2654
01:57:29,820 --> 01:57:33,600
And then the last tiny portion of it is
the suicide note,

2655
01:57:33,601 --> 01:57:35,520
which is clearly an indifferent
handwriting.

2656
01:57:35,970 --> 01:57:37,350
Bigger letters.
And they're like,

2657
01:57:37,351 --> 01:57:38,980
Whoa,
did she fucking write this?

2658
01:57:38,981 --> 01:57:41,700
Like it still doesn't mean that she
killed them.

2659
01:57:41,810 --> 01:57:46,810
It couldn't mean that crazy bitch wrote
a suicide note for him to make herself

2660
01:57:47,761 --> 01:57:51,240
look awesome that he loved them.
Just fucking crazy.

2661
01:57:51,690 --> 01:57:54,450
She's fucking crazy if I know,
but I don't think there's anybody that

2662
01:57:54,451 --> 01:57:56,550
believes that she's not crazy.
Exactly.

2663
01:57:56,700 --> 01:57:57,960
Exactly.
I would be.

2664
01:57:57,961 --> 01:57:59,780
I don't think there's a person that
would go nuts.

2665
01:58:00,030 --> 01:58:02,220
She's totally safe,
so she could be out of her mind.

2666
01:58:02,221 --> 01:58:03,980
She could be a liar.
She can be all those things.

2667
01:58:03,981 --> 01:58:07,500
It's still not be guilty of murder,
but there's nothing in that documentary

2668
01:58:07,501 --> 01:58:10,230
that shows that she killed him.
There's nothing.

2669
01:58:10,290 --> 01:58:14,130
It's just that it just shows she's nuts.
Which everybody already knew.

2670
01:58:14,240 --> 01:58:15,270
Yeah.
That's when it like it.

2671
01:58:15,271 --> 01:58:19,860
Everyone made a big deal about it and I
just like the reenacting really took me

2672
01:58:19,940 --> 01:58:23,100
completely picture,
but I've seen so many things.

2673
01:58:23,130 --> 01:58:26,160
Like everyone knows she's batshit.
It wouldn't surprise me at all if she

2674
01:58:26,161 --> 01:58:26,994
did that,
but.

2675
01:58:27,400 --> 01:58:28,190
Well the,
the,

2676
01:58:28,190 --> 01:58:32,160
the sheriff killed the police work is so
piss poor.

2677
01:58:32,280 --> 01:58:33,900
That was the,
one of the most disturbing things about

2678
01:58:33,901 --> 01:58:36,510
it.
When you find out what was it,

2679
01:58:36,511 --> 01:58:40,050
like 94 when he died or something like
that was like 1974.

2680
01:58:40,270 --> 01:58:44,530
And so we're pre internet.
So the accountability was minimal.

2681
01:58:44,620 --> 01:58:46,180
Small town,
you know,

2682
01:58:46,181 --> 01:58:49,720
ate a small area and then it was uh,
the Seattle police department.

2683
01:58:49,910 --> 01:58:53,230
The sheriff was a fucking idiot,
fucked up a bunch of other cases.

2684
01:58:53,231 --> 01:58:56,890
Eventually he was kicked out.
There was all sorts of bad police work

2685
01:58:56,891 --> 01:58:59,740
going on on top of that.
The difference between the first

2686
01:58:59,741 --> 01:59:03,490
responders accounts of the murder scene
versus his response.

2687
01:59:03,820 --> 01:59:06,460
Um,
the difference between the image of the

2688
01:59:08,140 --> 01:59:09,850
fucking.
It's allergies,

2689
01:59:10,880 --> 01:59:15,370
I'm the first responder said you could
clearly tell who it is and then you

2690
01:59:15,371 --> 01:59:15,970
know,
their,

2691
01:59:15,970 --> 01:59:18,640
their version of it,
that his face was blown off like,

2692
01:59:18,641 --> 01:59:22,450
well those are two different versions of
the fact that they cremated him six days

2693
01:59:22,451 --> 01:59:24,550
later.
The fact that they called it a suicide

2694
01:59:24,610 --> 01:59:27,880
instantly before the autopsy was
performed,

2695
01:59:27,881 --> 01:59:31,240
that you're supposed to leave that to a
forensic scientists to go over the

2696
01:59:31,241 --> 01:59:33,580
evidence.
They just as a cluster fuck,

2697
01:59:33,820 --> 01:59:36,340
but in that cluster fuck,
but don't try to kill themselves.

2698
01:59:36,850 --> 01:59:38,440
I don't believe anything.
I don't know.

2699
01:59:38,770 --> 01:59:40,880
I do not know.
The other thing is I don't know.

2700
01:59:40,930 --> 01:59:44,560
I don't understand heroin.
So when they say that he had three times

2701
01:59:44,561 --> 01:59:48,460
the lethal dose of heroin in his system
and that he wouldn't have been able to

2702
01:59:48,461 --> 01:59:48,970
pull the trigger.

2703
01:59:48,970 --> 01:59:51,520
I don't know if that's true.
I don't know if maybe he had an insane

2704
01:59:51,521 --> 01:59:53,110
tolerance because he did a lot of
heroin.

2705
01:59:53,750 --> 01:59:56,230
Yeah,
like maybe three times for you and I,

2706
01:59:56,260 --> 01:59:58,630
but not three times for him.
I don't know.

2707
01:59:59,020 --> 02:00:00,160
I don't know.
But it was,

2708
02:00:00,610 --> 02:00:02,560
it was creepy.
It's creepy documentary.

2709
02:00:03,550 --> 02:00:06,820
I mean that whole story.
That whole metal seem as creepy as shit.

2710
02:00:06,821 --> 02:00:07,920
I mean,
even like when,

2711
02:00:07,940 --> 02:00:08,771
uh,
uh,

2712
02:00:08,771 --> 02:00:10,470
what's his face?
Scott Weiland it,

2713
02:00:10,471 --> 02:00:13,450
read that he passed away.
I mean,

2714
02:00:13,451 --> 02:00:15,850
it's so terrible,
but I felt like every single person was

2715
02:00:15,851 --> 02:00:16,211
like,
well,

2716
02:00:16,211 --> 02:00:18,880
that was going to Scott Weiland.
I met him.

2717
02:00:18,940 --> 02:00:21,520
He did.
Dana White's a birthday party dean and

2718
02:00:21,521 --> 02:00:25,000
while he was president of the UFC and
performed stone temple pilots performed

2719
02:00:25,001 --> 02:00:27,640
at his birthday party and cool for were
swollen.

2720
02:00:27,641 --> 02:00:32,620
We just say they were fucking amazing
like three times and every time they

2721
02:00:32,621 --> 02:00:33,280
were awesome.

2722
02:00:33,280 --> 02:00:36,280
They performed in a,
in a ballroom for.

2723
02:00:36,430 --> 02:00:39,640
I mean maybe there was like 200 people
there and the people that were paying

2724
02:00:39,641 --> 02:00:42,100
attention when they went on stage,
it was like maybe 40,

2725
02:00:42,420 --> 02:00:46,420
like we had to get people up towards the
stage to pay attention.

2726
02:00:46,660 --> 02:00:50,590
That motherfucker rocked out.
Like he was in front of $25,000.

2727
02:00:50,591 --> 02:00:53,180
Sold out rabid fans.
I mean he,

2728
02:00:53,470 --> 02:00:55,870
he hit it hard.
I remember being humbled.

2729
02:00:56,140 --> 02:00:58,940
I remember seeing seeing that and going,
wow,

2730
02:00:58,941 --> 02:01:01,360
like that guy.
It made me want to do stand up better

2731
02:01:01,620 --> 02:01:02,453
and maybe like,
man,

2732
02:01:02,470 --> 02:01:04,300
I want to go right.
I want to,

2733
02:01:04,420 --> 02:01:07,590
I want to work on my performing because
that guy fucking nailed it.

2734
02:01:07,591 --> 02:01:10,470
Gave everything but backstage he was
willing.

2735
02:01:12,100 --> 02:01:14,980
He was a disaster because my friends
that had to deal with him,

2736
02:01:14,981 --> 02:01:17,320
the friends that worked for the UFC,
that had to like,

2737
02:01:17,380 --> 02:01:18,650
like he,
he,

2738
02:01:18,670 --> 02:01:22,390
he demanded to go on like right now or
he's getting out of there.

2739
02:01:22,480 --> 02:01:24,610
He's going to fucking leave.
I'm on my fucking money.

2740
02:01:24,611 --> 02:01:28,200
I want to go on right now like he was
just cracked out of his mind or heroin

2741
02:01:28,210 --> 02:01:30,970
out or whatever the fuck he was doing.
He just,

2742
02:01:31,120 --> 02:01:36,120
he was like barely you there all the
time and always on edge and you know,

2743
02:01:36,310 --> 02:01:40,310
you could blame it on his creative
juices

2744
02:01:40,310 --> 02:01:42,800
inside of him that made him such a
genius performer,

2745
02:01:42,920 --> 02:01:44,750
which are,
which is undeniable that he was a

2746
02:01:44,751 --> 02:01:47,070
genius,
like performance wise and mean.

2747
02:01:47,400 --> 02:01:49,840
He put on a show like every time I ever
saw him,

2748
02:01:50,330 --> 02:01:53,450
that band play that he was amazing.
But yeah.

2749
02:01:53,700 --> 02:01:56,270
Did you read what the mother of his
children said about them?

2750
02:01:56,600 --> 02:02:01,600
Like that rolling stone thing him so
fucked up and then you would go to be

2751
02:02:01,701 --> 02:02:05,390
married to that and you have children
with that guy and then he had new

2752
02:02:05,391 --> 02:02:09,350
children with their new wife and then
just sort of didn't talk to the old.

2753
02:02:09,530 --> 02:02:11,690
And of course obviously that's her,
her story.

2754
02:02:12,080 --> 02:02:15,870
Who knows how crazy she is,
who knows what the reality of it.

2755
02:02:16,010 --> 02:02:18,860
You could die and your ex boyfriend
could write a fucking crazy book about

2756
02:02:18,900 --> 02:02:20,270
yearning to be like,
you know,

2757
02:02:20,300 --> 02:02:21,530
all fiction.
Yeah,

2758
02:02:21,590 --> 02:02:23,820
we don't know,
but this is set.

2759
02:02:23,870 --> 02:02:25,910
That's a fucking crazy drug.
That heroin.

2760
02:02:26,160 --> 02:02:28,880
Oh,
I would never in a million years touch

2761
02:02:28,881 --> 02:02:31,180
that.
What if it made you like so good.

2762
02:02:31,550 --> 02:02:33,140
What have you.
What have you got a little bit of heroin

2763
02:02:33,150 --> 02:02:34,940
and microdose.
Afraid.

2764
02:02:35,260 --> 02:02:37,210
Microdose.
I'd be the one that would die like the

2765
02:02:37,220 --> 02:02:39,530
first time trying died first.
I'm trying it.

2766
02:02:39,560 --> 02:02:40,110
I'm like,
no,

2767
02:02:40,110 --> 02:02:43,640
I gotta let to live for it.
And they find out it's averse reaction

2768
02:02:43,641 --> 02:02:45,680
to Claritin,
Claritin,

2769
02:02:45,681 --> 02:02:46,580
d.
Oh,

2770
02:02:46,581 --> 02:02:48,340
you took the color and the day that 24
hour yet.

2771
02:02:48,350 --> 02:02:49,820
Now you're fucked.
You fucked up.

2772
02:02:49,821 --> 02:02:53,270
You fucked up girl.
It seems to have an awesome effect on

2773
02:02:53,730 --> 02:02:57,130
musicians so well until they die.
Yeah,

2774
02:02:57,680 --> 02:03:00,420
but up until up until age 27.
After that,

2775
02:03:00,421 --> 02:03:02,930
it seems to drop off radically.
This is like all the age.

2776
02:03:02,931 --> 02:03:03,860
Twenty seven people,
right?

2777
02:03:04,510 --> 02:03:09,510
Janis Joplin,
Morrison a Hendrix winehouse.

2778
02:03:09,710 --> 02:03:12,670
I'm Kurt cobain.
Yeah,

2779
02:03:13,100 --> 02:03:14,420
they all.
It's all 27.

2780
02:03:14,750 --> 02:03:17,390
So bizarre.
At 27 is the age that everybody just

2781
02:03:18,510 --> 02:03:20,240
Illuminati.
It's like that five thing.

2782
02:03:21,670 --> 02:03:26,120
It is high five HIV.
That's actually what I have.

2783
02:03:26,121 --> 02:03:29,420
That's why it's the age coming out of
your nose.

2784
02:03:29,421 --> 02:03:31,420
The night agencies.
We've got to touch it.

2785
02:03:31,421 --> 02:03:34,380
AIDS AIDS is acronym.
Yeah.

2786
02:03:34,400 --> 02:03:37,880
It's like,
is there a drug that has a more unique

2787
02:03:37,881 --> 02:03:40,670
relationship to music than heroin?
I don't think so.

2788
02:03:41,120 --> 02:03:46,120
The only comedian that I knew that was a
heroine guy was Hedberg and Mitch

2789
02:03:46,400 --> 02:03:51,400
Hedberg had like a sort of almost like a
jazzy sort of sense of humor and it was

2790
02:03:52,371 --> 02:03:53,980
like a weird.
Even his voice,

2791
02:03:54,280 --> 02:03:56,570
he spoke and everything.
It was like,

2792
02:03:56,571 --> 02:03:58,180
it was like a cool cat.
Yeah,

2793
02:03:58,250 --> 02:03:59,210
yeah,
yeah.

2794
02:03:59,630 --> 02:04:01,970
He would do his act sometimes with his
back to the crowd.

2795
02:04:02,540 --> 02:04:05,990
It would turn and do it and kill.
He was killing it wouldn't even looking

2796
02:04:05,991 --> 02:04:06,824
at everybody.

2797
02:04:07,280 --> 02:04:08,600
Well,
there's something about that confidence

2798
02:04:08,601 --> 02:04:11,240
due to do something that just fucking
outrageous.

2799
02:04:11,241 --> 02:04:14,720
Turn your back to the crowd but not give
a shit.

2800
02:04:14,721 --> 02:04:15,780
You're not nervous.
Like they,

2801
02:04:15,790 --> 02:04:17,750
they would sniff you out if you were
like,

2802
02:04:17,810 --> 02:04:19,040
yeah,
you're scared,

2803
02:04:19,180 --> 02:04:22,460
but it's like he had such control over
everybody that he just could do it and

2804
02:04:22,461 --> 02:04:23,720
everybody would laugh.
Well,

2805
02:04:23,721 --> 02:04:26,420
he was a unique guy in that for a long
time.

2806
02:04:26,421 --> 02:04:31,421
He had a real problem,
a following certain acts like when they

2807
02:04:32,090 --> 02:04:35,900
would say if you get booked in like the
funny bone and Columbus,

2808
02:04:35,901 --> 02:04:37,680
right.
If you get there,

2809
02:04:37,910 --> 02:04:38,250
if,

2810
02:04:38,250 --> 02:04:40,830
unless you are a big draw to the point
where you say,

2811
02:04:40,831 --> 02:04:42,780
Hey,
I'm bringing my opening acts with me.

2812
02:04:43,140 --> 02:04:46,800
They would book local people and so they
would have some guy like I know a story

2813
02:04:46,801 --> 02:04:48,960
where he went to this club.
They had a local guy,

2814
02:04:48,961 --> 02:04:51,840
local guy before him.
His fucking literally doing handstands.

2815
02:04:51,841 --> 02:04:53,820
He's singing and dancing.
He has music.

2816
02:04:53,821 --> 02:04:55,920
He plays,
he does a wrap to close.

2817
02:04:56,070 --> 02:04:58,140
He closed with a wrapped audience,
goes crazy,

2818
02:04:58,470 --> 02:05:00,750
and then Hedberg goes up there with
sunglasses on,

2819
02:05:00,780 --> 02:05:03,390
stands in front of the microphone and
says,

2820
02:05:03,450 --> 02:05:06,300
somebody asked me if I want a banana
frozen banana.

2821
02:05:06,301 --> 02:05:06,931
I said,
no,

2822
02:05:06,931 --> 02:05:09,810
but I want a regular banana later.
So yes,

2823
02:05:11,250 --> 02:05:14,460
that's funny.
But not after some dudes doing flips and

2824
02:05:14,461 --> 02:05:17,370
standing on his head and then shooting
rockets on his dick.

2825
02:05:17,590 --> 02:05:18,780
You know,
the guy

2826
02:05:20,330 --> 02:05:22,770
might be exaggerating,
but you know,

2827
02:05:22,771 --> 02:05:23,300
there's like.

2828
02:05:23,300 --> 02:05:26,730
So he would bomb.
He would have these horrible sets until

2829
02:05:26,731 --> 02:05:29,430
he found his audience and then when
people knew what to expect,

2830
02:05:29,431 --> 02:05:32,010
like from lettermen appearances and what
have you,

2831
02:05:32,250 --> 02:05:34,830
then they knew what to expect and it
would go to cm and then finally they

2832
02:05:34,831 --> 02:05:39,570
started doing the opening act correctly
and that guy had a really hard time

2833
02:05:39,571 --> 02:05:41,760
though because of the way we so
specific,

2834
02:05:41,761 --> 02:05:44,730
like the kind of comedy,
like you could probably go anywhere and

2835
02:05:44,731 --> 02:05:47,940
you could check the crowd out and go
like,

2836
02:05:47,970 --> 02:05:49,230
you could figure it,
you know,

2837
02:05:49,231 --> 02:05:51,810
in your head when something is working,
what they like and what they don't like,

2838
02:05:52,980 --> 02:05:56,370
you know,
even depends if someone's there to see

2839
02:05:57,660 --> 02:06:00,390
Gilbert Melendez,
not in the Gilbert Melendez,

2840
02:06:00,391 --> 02:06:02,670
he's a fighter.
Medical.

2841
02:06:02,730 --> 02:06:05,300
What's his name?
No,

2842
02:06:06,120 --> 02:06:08,540
no.
God dammit.

2843
02:06:09,780 --> 02:06:11,730
Who the fuck am I thinking of?
Fluffy.

2844
02:06:12,330 --> 02:06:14,550
Oh,
Jesus Christ.

2845
02:06:14,551 --> 02:06:16,110
Gilbert.
Gabriel Gilbert.

2846
02:06:17,250 --> 02:06:20,280
Like Gabriel Iglesias.
It's super family friendly,

2847
02:06:20,281 --> 02:06:21,750
very squeaky clean.

2848
02:06:21,750 --> 02:06:24,420
Very funny,
but very fluffy laughing.

2849
02:06:24,780 --> 02:06:29,040
If I went on and told some dark shit
after that or some,

2850
02:06:29,590 --> 02:06:34,230
it's just not my crowd.
Wrong crowd for me or on a group of old

2851
02:06:34,231 --> 02:06:36,120
people that went to see,
you know,

2852
02:06:36,150 --> 02:06:37,830
whatever,
fill in the blank with like a really

2853
02:06:37,880 --> 02:06:42,190
good carrot tops,
some squeaky clean and that's just,

2854
02:06:42,330 --> 02:06:44,960
you can get the wrong crowd for sure.
You know,

2855
02:06:44,970 --> 02:06:48,480
there's some crowds that just don't work
for you for your style of humor,

2856
02:06:48,540 --> 02:06:52,110
but like if you were going on a show and
it's like you Anthony Jeselnik and bill

2857
02:06:52,120 --> 02:06:53,630
burr wouldn't matter.
Right.

2858
02:06:54,300 --> 02:06:58,170
It's all the same.
We've done that 20,

2859
02:06:58,171 --> 02:07:02,240
30 times at the comedy store.
That's I think probably in my head.

2860
02:07:02,280 --> 02:07:03,920
Well the store you'll have,
but that,

2861
02:07:03,960 --> 02:07:06,030
you know,
someone might go on and.

2862
02:07:06,180 --> 02:07:08,790
Well they're really good at the store,
like setting the lineup and it really

2863
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:13,230
sort of homogenous way.
I did a horrible show there.

2864
02:07:13,231 --> 02:07:17,430
I rarely do the some girl I guess was
trying to put together a show and it was

2865
02:07:17,431 --> 02:07:20,460
like bring her show.
I don't know what it was.

2866
02:07:20,620 --> 02:07:21,271
Yeah,
they'll do like,

2867
02:07:21,271 --> 02:07:24,060
I didn't want my room.
Is it a weeknight in the main room?

2868
02:07:24,190 --> 02:07:26,680
It was like Monday night in the main
room with a shadows.

2869
02:07:26,730 --> 02:07:28,680
Never first time.
Ooh,

2870
02:07:28,830 --> 02:07:30,300
I'm in main room,
eight people,

2871
02:07:30,460 --> 02:07:31,680
you know,
it was just mad.

2872
02:07:31,681 --> 02:07:35,280
It was just absolutely bad.
Everything I said bomb like nothing.

2873
02:07:35,290 --> 02:07:36,070
And I was just going

2874
02:07:36,070 --> 02:07:40,030
like,
how many more minutes do a red light?

2875
02:07:40,031 --> 02:07:42,070
Could you flick that at me?
I mean it was just,

2876
02:07:42,071 --> 02:07:43,420
it was bad,
but I didn't like,

2877
02:07:43,900 --> 02:07:45,280
this is not my crowd.
Like

2878
02:07:45,480 --> 02:07:47,460
they had a show there the other day and
uh,

2879
02:07:47,550 --> 02:07:49,290
I got there,
excuse me.

2880
02:07:49,380 --> 02:07:53,070
I got there and the waitresses are like,
dude,

2881
02:07:53,310 --> 02:07:55,830
go to the main room,
see this fucking show in the main room.

2882
02:07:55,831 --> 02:07:56,670
I go,
what's going on?

2883
02:07:56,910 --> 02:07:59,400
They go a cult rented out the main room
and I go,

2884
02:07:59,401 --> 02:08:03,270
what are you serious?
So I went in there and when I went in

2885
02:08:03,271 --> 02:08:04,860
there,
the show was just ending.

2886
02:08:04,861 --> 02:08:07,790
The comedy show was just ending.
So some comedian was onstage.

2887
02:08:07,860 --> 02:08:10,410
I didn't,
I don't know who the comedian was and it

2888
02:08:10,411 --> 02:08:12,420
just wasn't going so well.
I was going okay.

2889
02:08:12,421 --> 02:08:14,250
But it was just very,
very strange.

2890
02:08:14,460 --> 02:08:17,520
And then after the show they all huddled
up around mother,

2891
02:08:18,030 --> 02:08:20,310
mother,
this woman that they called mother who

2892
02:08:20,311 --> 02:08:24,570
was the head of the cult and there's
like 50 people around her.

2893
02:08:24,571 --> 02:08:28,980
They're all dressed to the nines suits
and ties like the nicest dresses,

2894
02:08:28,981 --> 02:08:31,050
like everybody's dressed up,
like they're going to a,

2895
02:08:31,060 --> 02:08:32,280
a,
an award show,

2896
02:08:32,340 --> 02:08:32,940
right.

2897
02:08:32,940 --> 02:08:37,230
And mother sat around with her back to
the stage where they're all facing her.

2898
02:08:37,231 --> 02:08:39,160
Like as if she was on stage,
I mean she might as well have been on

2899
02:08:39,161 --> 02:08:41,850
stage and she was talking like,
you know,

2900
02:08:41,851 --> 02:08:44,880
like really like self help,
nonsense,

2901
02:08:44,881 --> 02:08:48,090
sort of fucking cookie cutter
scientology style,

2902
02:08:48,091 --> 02:08:50,040
talking about,
you know,

2903
02:08:50,640 --> 02:08:54,510
our intention,
what we put out into the world is what

2904
02:08:54,511 --> 02:08:57,510
the world gives us back.
If you love yourself,

2905
02:08:57,511 --> 02:09:01,530
the world loves that kind of Shit.
And they were all like cheering along

2906
02:09:01,531 --> 02:09:05,340
with it and clapping with her and say it
was so fucking strange.

2907
02:09:05,370 --> 02:09:06,480
It was so strange.

2908
02:09:06,570 --> 02:09:08,580
But they rented the room like how did
they even rent them?

2909
02:09:08,820 --> 02:09:11,390
Don't understand what happened.
I don't know what happened because I got

2910
02:09:11,391 --> 02:09:12,160
there late,
you know,

2911
02:09:12,160 --> 02:09:14,490
I got there like as it was ending,
the last comment was onstage,

2912
02:09:14,570 --> 02:09:18,450
but Al Madrigal had been on earlier and
it was just fucking eaten deck up there

2913
02:09:19,790 --> 02:09:22,730
and he apparently goes,
what the fuck kind of crowd is this.

2914
02:09:22,880 --> 02:09:26,390
Like he was saying it while he was up
there because he realized he looked out

2915
02:09:26,391 --> 02:09:30,060
and he sees all these people with suits
and ties and dresses and they're all

2916
02:09:30,110 --> 02:09:32,480
there.
They're all fucking super lost.

2917
02:09:32,481 --> 02:09:37,481
I mean like really lost strange people.
I'll never forget first sitting there

2918
02:09:38,391 --> 02:09:40,790
and then gathered around her,
talking to her,

2919
02:09:41,240 --> 02:09:43,700
listening to her every hang on every
word she says.

2920
02:09:43,701 --> 02:09:48,701
We saw bird feeding its babies
spit and it was all just waiting for it.

2921
02:09:50,111 --> 02:09:51,830
A hallmark card.
Shit.

2922
02:09:51,831 --> 02:09:54,890
It was fucking strange.
Really strange.

2923
02:09:55,280 --> 02:09:56,113
Yeah.

2924
02:09:56,300 --> 02:09:59,390
Well that whole self help thing,
you know if you are,

2925
02:09:59,450 --> 02:10:02,420
if you're so inclined you can piece
together,

2926
02:10:02,421 --> 02:10:06,230
especially today like it's not.
We're not talking about like Anthony

2927
02:10:06,230 --> 02:10:11,230
Robbins days of 1988 or nobody else was
doing it and you had to actually have

2928
02:10:11,571 --> 02:10:15,360
some really concise thoughts about how
to improve yourself.

2929
02:10:15,640 --> 02:10:18,740
They're repeating other people.
Nobody's come up with something brand

2930
02:10:18,741 --> 02:10:19,820
spanking new.
Exactly.

2931
02:10:19,830 --> 02:10:20,571
Yeah,
but you.

2932
02:10:20,571 --> 02:10:23,360
All you have to do is sort of mind the
internet for these things,

2933
02:10:23,570 --> 02:10:26,660
repackage them,
reshape them and put on a seminar and

2934
02:10:26,661 --> 02:10:28,600
have all these people together and
there's people that are doing that.

2935
02:10:28,610 --> 02:10:31,460
Right?
That voice and that's just that weird,

2936
02:10:31,970 --> 02:10:33,510
odd look.
Oh yeah.

2937
02:10:34,040 --> 02:10:35,720
I watched that documentary.
The source family.

2938
02:10:35,721 --> 02:10:37,220
Do you ever see that one?
No,

2939
02:10:37,221 --> 02:10:39,200
I haven't,
but it's pretty Whitney.

2940
02:10:39,201 --> 02:10:40,490
Cummings was telling me I have to see
it.

2941
02:10:40,491 --> 02:10:44,510
It's good because I don't think anybody
really heard of it because the guy

2942
02:10:44,511 --> 02:10:46,550
didn't like do a Mass Jones,
you know,

2943
02:10:46,551 --> 02:10:50,690
like he fucking got an angle either in
Hawaii and said,

2944
02:10:51,020 --> 02:10:54,770
Jesus wants me to fly out and then say,
yeah,

2945
02:10:54,771 --> 02:10:59,150
he didn't make it.
Maybe that's how Jesus wanted them to

2946
02:10:59,151 --> 02:10:59,931
come to him.
I was like,

2947
02:10:59,931 --> 02:11:01,310
oh,
he didn't kill his people.

2948
02:11:01,311 --> 02:11:02,330
He just was like,
nope.

2949
02:11:02,331 --> 02:11:05,930
I'm getting vibes that I need to go on
this hang glider on this cliff and

2950
02:11:06,710 --> 02:11:11,210
that's a fucked up way to go,
but actually he survived and then died

2951
02:11:11,211 --> 02:11:12,110
like a few,
you know,

2952
02:11:12,710 --> 02:11:14,480
one or two days later,
something like that.

2953
02:11:14,481 --> 02:11:15,410
But Oh,
less,

2954
02:11:15,470 --> 02:11:17,900
less exciting.
But it was fun.

2955
02:11:18,680 --> 02:11:19,790
Yeah.
I'm sure.

2956
02:11:19,791 --> 02:11:24,110
Maybe that's what he was hoping for,
but hang gliding seems like a fucking

2957
02:11:24,140 --> 02:11:26,630
great time,
but I'm not trying it.

2958
02:11:27,320 --> 02:11:28,520
No.
I need to like,

2959
02:11:28,521 --> 02:11:29,480
uh,
no,

2960
02:11:29,510 --> 02:11:30,530
I couldn't do that.
Well,

2961
02:11:30,531 --> 02:11:33,410
you have to depend on the wind.
I don't like depending on things like

2962
02:11:33,411 --> 02:11:35,090
that.
I'm not into depending on wind,

2963
02:11:35,510 --> 02:11:37,760
it seems like a,
it does whatever the fuck it wants.

2964
02:11:38,990 --> 02:11:40,490
Doesn't want to listen.
It's weird.

2965
02:11:40,750 --> 02:11:42,590
Yeah.
It's like tell him no,

2966
02:11:42,890 --> 02:11:46,370
that would be like floating in the water
on a boat,

2967
02:11:46,880 --> 02:11:50,570
sailing around on a boat in and all of a
sudden the boat decides it doesn't want

2968
02:11:50,571 --> 02:11:53,690
to be buoyant and that's kind of what
you're doing.

2969
02:11:54,480 --> 02:11:58,160
You're floating in the air depending
upon these drafts with whoops,

2970
02:11:59,760 --> 02:12:00,760
fucking reflux.
Claritin,

2971
02:12:01,900 --> 02:12:04,400
like a cat.
But if,

2972
02:12:04,860 --> 02:12:06,560
I mean,
I think that can happen right?

2973
02:12:06,561 --> 02:12:08,730
The wind just dies off and you just
follow him around

2974
02:12:10,490 --> 02:12:10,760
much.

2975
02:12:10,760 --> 02:12:11,830
I grew up with the coast.
I mean,

2976
02:12:11,840 --> 02:12:14,930
Shit.
I wouldn't go fucking hang gliding.

2977
02:12:15,230 --> 02:12:20,170
Hell no,
but that guy did because he had his son

2978
02:12:20,390 --> 02:12:22,520
told him getting a sign that I need to
hang.

2979
02:12:22,521 --> 02:12:23,630
Glide.
Well,

2980
02:12:23,631 --> 02:12:26,120
nothing's more nerdy than those wingsuit
dudes.

2981
02:12:26,180 --> 02:12:30,480
I had this dude andy stumped in here who
has the world record for wingsuit

2982
02:12:30,620 --> 02:12:32,810
travel.
That shit's insane.

2983
02:12:33,490 --> 02:12:36,050
I just watched something on it and this
guy,

2984
02:12:36,051 --> 02:12:38,680
I mean they're nuts and they'll break
like every fucking boner.

2985
02:12:38,690 --> 02:12:40,790
Don't back out there.
I've got to get back out.

2986
02:12:41,030 --> 02:12:41,751
Yeah.
One Guy,

2987
02:12:41,751 --> 02:12:44,900
he,
he hit his foot on the edge of a rock

2988
02:12:44,930 --> 02:12:46,480
and then just going,
you know,

2989
02:12:46,490 --> 02:12:48,080
who knows how my fucking fast.
Yeah,

2990
02:12:48,081 --> 02:12:49,280
I did see that.
Like everything.

2991
02:12:49,281 --> 02:12:49,911
Yeah,
I'm broke.

2992
02:12:49,911 --> 02:12:52,310
All of his shitty lived.
Got Right back on it.

2993
02:12:53,510 --> 02:12:56,690
That's how awesome wingsuit flying his
break everything.

2994
02:12:56,900 --> 02:13:01,160
You have to be there like you have to
have somethings you're wired differently

2995
02:13:01,670 --> 02:13:02,930
because that's not.

2996
02:13:03,440 --> 02:13:05,450
We have to be wired differently to try
it in the first place.

2997
02:13:05,451 --> 02:13:07,250
Right.
I mean,

2998
02:13:07,580 --> 02:13:10,730
who would go flying squirrel suit,
you know,

2999
02:13:10,760 --> 02:13:12,110
fuck this shit,
this shit to work.

3000
02:13:12,700 --> 02:13:16,160
It must be so fun though.
I imagine it is fun.

3001
02:13:16,670 --> 02:13:18,560
But boy,
I mean,

3002
02:13:18,650 --> 02:13:19,910
have you ever done a hoverboard?
You know,

3003
02:13:19,911 --> 02:13:22,660
those little roller board things.
So this little segue,

3004
02:13:22,730 --> 02:13:24,050
but it doesn't have a handle.
You know,

3005
02:13:24,051 --> 02:13:26,250
those things that they see the kids do.
Well,

3006
02:13:26,610 --> 02:13:27,440
yeah,
I have,

3007
02:13:27,440 --> 02:13:29,360
they're fun right there.
They are fun.

3008
02:13:29,361 --> 02:13:31,620
But those kids,
it's just like two teenagers need to be

3009
02:13:31,621 --> 02:13:33,780
on wheels.
Like the little kids have them.

3010
02:13:33,860 --> 02:13:35,460
I know.
But you know when you select those lazy

3011
02:13:35,461 --> 02:13:38,010
fucking kids in the mall just walking
and then now they're just,

3012
02:13:39,180 --> 02:13:42,900
it's so don't you feel that's one of
those things where the technology comes

3013
02:13:42,901 --> 02:13:46,050
along before they have rules.
Like remember when people used to be

3014
02:13:46,051 --> 02:13:48,030
able to smoke those e-cigarettes on
planes,

3015
02:13:48,500 --> 02:13:52,140
they just be puffing on those blue
e-cigarettes like who's that fucking

3016
02:13:52,170 --> 02:13:54,790
goofy guy that was doing.
Yes,

3017
02:13:54,870 --> 02:13:57,270
yes.
When I saw

3018
02:13:59,460 --> 02:14:04,460
him fucking hockey and I was freedom to
seeing you in a movie in 1990.

3019
02:14:05,590 --> 02:14:08,610
Like this is what you're doing.
Like what he had to.

3020
02:14:08,670 --> 02:14:09,840
But I love it.
He was still like,

3021
02:14:09,841 --> 02:14:10,674
yeah,
it's me.

3022
02:14:10,800 --> 02:14:13,950
Stephen Dorff.
Take back your guys.

3023
02:14:14,100 --> 02:14:16,200
Come on guys.
Take back your freedom.

3024
02:14:16,201 --> 02:14:17,034
There it is.
Look,

3025
02:14:18,030 --> 02:14:19,170
come on guys.

3026
02:14:21,190 --> 02:14:24,990
There's just something so non rebel
about sucking on a little robot Dick.

3027
02:14:25,840 --> 02:14:28,260
Yeah.
It looks like they're sucking on a home

3028
02:14:28,261 --> 02:14:30,270
pregnancy.
Otherwise those things are great.

3029
02:14:30,330 --> 02:14:34,290
Before you go on stage,
they'll look like tobacco or nicotine

3030
02:14:34,291 --> 02:14:39,160
rather is a stimulant and it is actually
a good stimulant to take before you go

3031
02:14:39,161 --> 02:14:42,690
on stage.
Really fires up your brain.

3032
02:14:42,930 --> 02:14:46,530
Joey Diaz told me about it so it gets me
fired up right before and wants to other

3033
02:14:46,531 --> 02:14:50,280
vape pens that had like the,
all those big giant fucking like you're

3034
02:14:50,281 --> 02:14:54,090
holding onto a lunchbox and the ones
that have like the marijuana oils and

3035
02:14:54,091 --> 02:14:55,200
I'm.
Oh I have those right here.

3036
02:14:55,201 --> 02:14:57,120
You won't want to travel.
What kinds of you have?

3037
02:14:57,390 --> 02:14:59,040
I have all of them.
You name it.

3038
02:14:59,070 --> 02:15:01,080
I have.
Do you have the g pen?

3039
02:15:01,230 --> 02:15:03,930
I got one of those.
I have a friend that does a friend,

3040
02:15:04,380 --> 02:15:08,870
a friend of mine that does marketing ops
endorsed.

3041
02:15:08,960 --> 02:15:10,710
We have like a fucking stack of them
back there.

3042
02:15:10,711 --> 02:15:11,491
Right.
Those cheap pens.

3043
02:15:11,491 --> 02:15:13,560
My friend Bunbee from UGK.
Oh Shit.

3044
02:15:13,800 --> 02:15:16,830
Yeah.
The best ones are the ones that have the

3045
02:15:16,860 --> 02:15:19,480
oil.
Was the one that you screw the top off.

3046
02:15:19,920 --> 02:15:21,460
You plug them into USB plot.

3047
02:15:24,690 --> 02:15:26,680
I'll call my doctor.
He was my friend who hasn't met.

3048
02:15:27,600 --> 02:15:30,780
I got my prescription from a doctor as
well.

3049
02:15:30,840 --> 02:15:31,440
No,
I don't have.

3050
02:15:31,440 --> 02:15:32,630
I don't even have one,
but he.

3051
02:15:32,670 --> 02:15:33,960
My friend has one,
so I was like,

3052
02:15:33,961 --> 02:15:35,430
Hey,
if you're up and you're going to go get

3053
02:15:35,431 --> 02:15:37,560
me some lessons.
This is broadcast nationally.

3054
02:15:37,561 --> 02:15:38,850
You do have one,
right?

3055
02:15:39,110 --> 02:15:41,670
You do have a prescription.
You're not taking marijuana illegally.

3056
02:15:41,671 --> 02:15:43,610
Right?
I'm totally teasing.

3057
02:15:43,900 --> 02:15:46,410
You don't even have one.
You don't even have to have one now.

3058
02:15:46,411 --> 02:15:48,090
I don't even have a vape and I was just.
Oh,

3059
02:15:48,091 --> 02:15:49,480
you're kidding.
It's just fiction.

3060
02:15:49,481 --> 02:15:50,970
It is Joe.
It was one of my friends.

3061
02:15:50,971 --> 02:15:54,450
Has it.
Do five guys trying to sound cool.

3062
02:15:55,030 --> 02:15:57,480
You one of the cool kids.
Shouldn't be one of the cool kids.

3063
02:15:57,680 --> 02:16:01,410
Did you mess with edibles?
She's nodding.

3064
02:16:01,470 --> 02:16:05,460
I have in my previous life.
Have you had any bad experiences?

3065
02:16:05,930 --> 02:16:06,790
Yeah.
Yeah.

3066
02:16:06,850 --> 02:16:08,910
Everybody has.
Everybody's happy because you don't know

3067
02:16:08,911 --> 02:16:12,140
how much and it wasn't edibles.
It was the.

3068
02:16:12,141 --> 02:16:14,310
I was always the brown.
He said everybody started with and I was

3069
02:16:14,311 --> 02:16:17,610
in college and I remember like it was a
costume party.

3070
02:16:17,670 --> 02:16:22,670
It was around Halloween so everyone's at
the bar and costume and I couldn't find

3071
02:16:22,771 --> 02:16:27,120
my sister and roommate because my sister
and I went to the same college.

3072
02:16:27,540 --> 02:16:30,100
I was walking in circles because they
were dressed like

3073
02:16:30,100 --> 02:16:31,690
other people and I was like

3074
02:16:34,770 --> 02:16:38,060
fucking nightmare scenario.
And then finally they came up to me and

3075
02:16:38,160 --> 02:16:40,740
they're like,
you walk past like 30 times and you look

3076
02:16:40,741 --> 02:16:41,730
off.
Freaked out.

3077
02:16:41,731 --> 02:16:43,770
I was like,
it doesn't help.

3078
02:16:43,771 --> 02:16:45,180
I have big eyes too,
so I'm like,

3079
02:16:45,210 --> 02:16:48,030
just so fucking panicky and jumpy.
Oh God.

3080
02:16:48,031 --> 02:16:49,930
It scared the shit.
I just went back to my apartment and

3081
02:16:49,940 --> 02:16:50,850
later I was like,
just make it.

3082
02:16:50,851 --> 02:16:52,590
Stop.
Make it stop.

3083
02:16:53,370 --> 02:16:54,203
Yeah.
I

3084
02:16:56,090 --> 02:16:59,890
was a judge of the Cannabis Cup once.
I don't even know what that is.

3085
02:16:59,920 --> 02:17:04,050
The Cannabis Cup is this thing where
they judge a weed and they decide like,

3086
02:17:04,060 --> 02:17:06,100
what's the best,
is it like one of those beer?

3087
02:17:06,820 --> 02:17:08,470
It's way worse.
Here's the thing,

3088
02:17:08,620 --> 02:17:13,570
you don't have any idea which one is
hitting you better or not or you don't

3089
02:17:13,571 --> 02:17:14,950
know like this is what the,
you know,

3090
02:17:14,980 --> 02:17:18,400
like um,
like old people have like those Monday

3091
02:17:18,401 --> 02:17:21,580
through Sunday pillow things and each
one,

3092
02:17:21,630 --> 02:17:23,200
you know,
you pop them open and you take it.

3093
02:17:23,860 --> 02:17:25,600
It was that.
It would give you one of those.

3094
02:17:25,900 --> 02:17:29,710
I said I had it with a dried wheat in it
for like the longest sitting on.

3095
02:17:29,711 --> 02:17:31,420
I'm like,
I'm going to save this and I put it

3096
02:17:31,421 --> 02:17:33,700
away.
Just does a nostalgia for the highest

3097
02:17:33,701 --> 02:17:35,800
I've ever been in my life.
So I get there.

3098
02:17:36,550 --> 02:17:38,680
They give everybody that's a judge.
They asked me to be a,

3099
02:17:38,681 --> 02:17:41,230
just to give everybody who's a judge,
one of these little boxes with all these

3100
02:17:41,231 --> 02:17:44,140
different strains in it and each one has
a name and you know,

3101
02:17:44,141 --> 02:17:45,480
Blah Blah Blah.
Now the name,

3102
02:17:45,550 --> 02:17:47,260
you're supposed to start smoking it.
Yeah.

3103
02:17:47,410 --> 02:17:48,880
So you started some,
but you don't know what,

3104
02:17:48,940 --> 02:17:51,850
what's getting you high and what's not
your highest fuck?

3105
02:17:52,240 --> 02:17:54,550
First of all,
we went into this place that they did

3106
02:17:54,551 --> 02:17:56,290
it.
It was just this place on melrose.

3107
02:17:56,291 --> 02:17:58,210
It was like a head shop in the back of
the head shop.

3108
02:17:58,211 --> 02:18:02,710
They had this big giant room where all
these people ran and I remember just

3109
02:18:02,890 --> 02:18:07,890
being just completely blitzed out of my
mind by the time I got to Tuesday,

3110
02:18:10,570 --> 02:18:11,500
Wednesday,
Thursday,

3111
02:18:11,501 --> 02:18:14,260
Friday,
Saturday and Sunday I am fucked up man

3112
02:18:14,590 --> 02:18:16,720
and people are handing me cookies and
I'm just eating them.

3113
02:18:17,390 --> 02:18:21,220
They're just eating them.
People are handing me bags like those a

3114
02:18:21,221 --> 02:18:23,890
volcano bags.
I'm fucking sucking on a volcano bag.

3115
02:18:24,100 --> 02:18:27,400
I just went as deep as I've ever gone in
my life.

3116
02:18:27,430 --> 02:18:32,430
How many days before you came to?
I was legitimately high for 24 hours.

3117
02:18:32,680 --> 02:18:35,800
Like I'm not like legitimately.
Did you do anything?

3118
02:18:35,801 --> 02:18:36,360
No,
no,

3119
02:18:36,360 --> 02:18:37,510
no.
Were you just sitting?

3120
02:18:37,720 --> 02:18:42,160
I just laid down after it was over.
I remember thinking I can't even.

3121
02:18:42,250 --> 02:18:44,050
I don't even.
I can't even form sentences.

3122
02:18:44,051 --> 02:18:46,630
I can't.
Like I didn't know what I was doing.

3123
02:18:46,631 --> 02:18:48,580
I didn't know this is,
this is I got,

3124
02:18:48,670 --> 02:18:53,670
I got so high that people stopped,
they stopped looking like people to me

3125
02:18:54,910 --> 02:18:58,810
and what they started being is like two
dimensional,

3126
02:18:58,990 --> 02:19:03,990
like a cardboard cut out like a movie
Promo cutout of a person and then behind

3127
02:19:04,031 --> 02:19:07,450
that person was like their soul.
It was like peeking around the corner,

3128
02:19:07,451 --> 02:19:10,200
like looking at you like they were
walking towards you with this like

3129
02:19:10,240 --> 02:19:13,300
cardboard cutout and behind them this.

3130
02:19:13,330 --> 02:19:16,150
That's how the,
that's like the impression that I got

3131
02:19:16,151 --> 02:19:18,070
from looking at them.
There's just like a two dimensional

3132
02:19:18,071 --> 02:19:22,060
outside and then I could occasionally
seek glimpses of the real self,

3133
02:19:22,061 --> 02:19:24,640
like peeking around the corner looking
at me and then Heidi,

3134
02:19:26,070 --> 02:19:27,590
I was terrified.
Yeah.

3135
02:19:27,591 --> 02:19:28,420
I was just,
I was,

3136
02:19:28,420 --> 02:19:32,540
I was untethered,
untethered from reality from life.

3137
02:19:32,850 --> 02:19:33,740
I,
I was,

3138
02:19:34,370 --> 02:19:37,740
I was gone and I remember having this
weird conversation with this.

3139
02:19:37,790 --> 02:19:39,470
Here's the thing about these marijuana
people,

3140
02:19:39,680 --> 02:19:42,310
especially marijuana,
this is what we're were talking like I

3141
02:19:42,311 --> 02:19:45,620
think I was a judge in 2003,
something like that.

3142
02:19:45,770 --> 02:19:48,280
Two thousand two are still in your
system from the problem.

3143
02:19:48,680 --> 02:19:53,210
Probably still test positive,
but the people that were into it,

3144
02:19:53,340 --> 02:19:56,840
the really involved in the quote unquote
cannabis community.

3145
02:19:56,841 --> 02:20:00,800
It was a small sort of tight knit group
that we're producing it and selling it

3146
02:20:00,801 --> 02:20:02,690
and growing it and they would gather
together so these,

3147
02:20:02,880 --> 02:20:05,780
they would use these things as an excuse
to kind of get together with everybody

3148
02:20:06,230 --> 02:20:11,000
and that kind of in this conversation
with this guy who was banking on the

3149
02:20:11,001 --> 02:20:14,450
cannabis community,
taking care of him when he was old and

3150
02:20:14,451 --> 02:20:17,120
that's what he was like concentrating on
like it was.

3151
02:20:17,150 --> 02:20:18,620
I was so high,
just had to listen.

3152
02:20:18,621 --> 02:20:22,010
I couldn't even talk.
I was wearing and he was saying,

3153
02:20:22,011 --> 02:20:24,220
well,
this amazing thing is the cannabis

3154
02:20:24,230 --> 02:20:26,230
community.
Like they're gonna have me,

3155
02:20:26,300 --> 02:20:29,000
they're going to take care of me.
The cannabis community will be there for

3156
02:20:29,001 --> 02:20:29,834
you.
So right.

3157
02:20:30,220 --> 02:20:31,870
Nk with them or something,
you know,

3158
02:20:32,180 --> 02:20:34,130
he thought the cannabis community was
like the small,

3159
02:20:34,131 --> 02:20:37,200
tight knit thing and now it's a swarm of
humanity.

3160
02:20:37,220 --> 02:20:39,680
Even if there is no cannabis community,
homey.

3161
02:20:39,681 --> 02:20:41,230
It's called life.
Yeah.

3162
02:20:41,460 --> 02:20:43,910
It's just humans.
But to him it was like,

3163
02:20:43,940 --> 02:20:46,790
you know,
like local growers or whatever it was

3164
02:20:46,791 --> 02:20:50,340
like this local organic community of
work.

3165
02:20:50,530 --> 02:20:54,290
So it was just a strange conversation
like that was his angle was almost like

3166
02:20:54,291 --> 02:20:57,620
he was like really into pot because it
had given him an identity within this

3167
02:20:57,621 --> 02:21:01,340
community.
So he was expressing that to me in this

3168
02:21:01,370 --> 02:21:05,390
very strange way and almost trying to
like wrap my head around like what he

3169
02:21:05,391 --> 02:21:07,460
thought was gonna happen,
you know.

3170
02:21:07,461 --> 02:21:08,620
But he kept saying that,
you know,

3171
02:21:08,710 --> 02:21:10,610
the cannabis community,
so always going to take care of me,

3172
02:21:10,611 --> 02:21:11,520
the cannabis community.
I'm like,

3173
02:21:11,810 --> 02:21:13,420
guess what dude?
The canvas community,

3174
02:21:13,450 --> 02:21:16,060
just fucking people like,
people are just going to take care of

3175
02:21:16,061 --> 02:21:16,540
it.

3176
02:21:16,540 --> 02:21:21,540
Another stoner dude
got out of the room,

3177
02:21:23,570 --> 02:21:26,750
one of my roommates in college one time
just ate a shit ton of pot brownies and

3178
02:21:26,810 --> 02:21:29,240
she wanted to go to Wendy's for food of
course.

3179
02:21:29,241 --> 02:21:30,820
And she's like,
what do you tending to Wendy's some

3180
02:21:30,980 --> 02:21:31,813
food?
I was like,

3181
02:21:31,850 --> 02:21:34,480
sure.
In my car she's in.

3182
02:21:34,520 --> 02:21:36,630
As soon as I go through the drive
through and you're going to,

3183
02:21:36,631 --> 02:21:37,820
Wendy's going to take your order.
She goes,

3184
02:21:37,821 --> 02:21:38,990
Dr,
just get out of here.

3185
02:21:42,430 --> 02:21:46,070
That's when it really hit her part in
that person's saying,

3186
02:21:46,071 --> 02:21:48,240
welcome to Wendy's.
He lost her shit.

3187
02:21:48,700 --> 02:21:50,510
If I don't drive,
she's going to jump out of my car.

3188
02:21:50,511 --> 02:21:55,490
Like she was really like freaked out.
Like just go,

3189
02:21:55,670 --> 02:21:56,650
just go.
Just try.

3190
02:21:57,190 --> 02:21:58,540
Just try.
I'm sorry.

3191
02:21:59,380 --> 02:22:02,060
Oh No,
it's not good.

3192
02:22:02,090 --> 02:22:05,390
But yeah,
pot eating pot can really fuck with you

3193
02:22:05,420 --> 02:22:09,050
in a way that nothing else can be any
and it won't go away.

3194
02:22:09,051 --> 02:22:12,710
There's nothing you can take or do.
You will have to wait it out.

3195
02:22:12,711 --> 02:22:15,440
And one thing that helps a little bit is
coffee.

3196
02:22:15,680 --> 02:22:19,040
Coffee does copy cat,
but I mean if you're so whacked out

3197
02:22:19,041 --> 02:22:21,880
you're just like,
I just want to sit in a chair and wait

3198
02:22:21,890 --> 02:22:23,110
this,
ride this out.

3199
02:22:23,220 --> 02:22:24,980
Do you know the different wall?
Here's.

3200
02:22:25,160 --> 02:22:26,580
I've talked about this so many times
before.

3201
02:22:26,581 --> 02:22:28,980
People gonna get annoyed,
but do you know what happens when you

3202
02:22:28,981 --> 02:22:31,230
eat it?
That there's a different like biological

3203
02:22:31,231 --> 02:22:33,780
processes opposed to smoking?
When you smoke it,

3204
02:22:33,781 --> 02:22:37,230
you're your body's reacting to Thc,
which is the active compound when you

3205
02:22:37,231 --> 02:22:39,120
smoke it,
but when you eat it,

3206
02:22:39,121 --> 02:22:42,510
it's processed by your liver and it
produces something called 11 hydroxy

3207
02:22:42,511 --> 02:22:46,170
metabolite that's five times more
psychoactive than thc.

3208
02:22:46,590 --> 02:22:50,520
It's insanely powerful and it's a much
more psychedelic drug.

3209
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:54,270
Like you'll have hallucinations and
especially if you close your eyes,

3210
02:22:54,510 --> 02:22:56,940
you can have some really,
really intense.

3211
02:22:57,130 --> 02:22:59,730
That freaks me out too much in the
moment.

3212
02:22:59,731 --> 02:23:00,720
I close my eyes.
I'm like,

3213
02:23:01,140 --> 02:23:04,130
oh,
well.

3214
02:23:04,380 --> 02:23:06,540
I was on both when I was at the Cannabis
Cup.

3215
02:23:06,541 --> 02:23:10,140
That was what was so fucked up because I
had been high from smoking it.

3216
02:23:10,170 --> 02:23:13,380
I don't know anything
horrible.

3217
02:23:13,650 --> 02:23:15,990
Throwing it up was great.
If it's alcohol,

3218
02:23:16,330 --> 02:23:20,520
if you throw up and you drink alcohol,
you know it gets out of your system and

3219
02:23:20,521 --> 02:23:20,970
you,
you,

3220
02:23:20,970 --> 02:23:24,150
it helps you sober up quicker.
But like if I was,

3221
02:23:24,510 --> 02:23:26,460
you know,
we all do it stupid.

3222
02:23:26,461 --> 02:23:31,200
We don't know how we can take when we're
in college and I would drink until I was

3223
02:23:31,201 --> 02:23:31,620
like,
just,

3224
02:23:31,620 --> 02:23:32,910
you know,
hammered and then I will.

3225
02:23:32,940 --> 02:23:34,140
Oh yeah,
I'll look that.

3226
02:23:34,141 --> 02:23:38,730
And then I always appeared that'd be the
only time I'd ever puke was when I did

3227
02:23:38,731 --> 02:23:39,211
that.
And I'm like,

3228
02:23:39,211 --> 02:23:40,044
yeah,
I need to learn.

3229
02:23:40,050 --> 02:23:41,960
We'll.
It's also because when you smoke you,

3230
02:23:41,990 --> 02:23:45,480
you become hyper aware and you're body
is aware of the poison side to you in

3231
02:23:45,481 --> 02:23:46,920
the form of alcohol.
And your body's like,

3232
02:23:46,930 --> 02:23:49,180
what did you do?
Get it out.

3233
02:23:52,680 --> 02:23:53,513
I took a,
uh,

3234
02:23:53,780 --> 02:23:57,700
a pot that sky made thc pills.
It was this,

3235
02:23:57,720 --> 02:23:59,430
a friend of mine,
they were like,

3236
02:23:59,431 --> 02:24:02,100
he figured out how to make pills and I
don't know how he did it,

3237
02:24:02,310 --> 02:24:04,940
but he made them in these capsules.
And um,

3238
02:24:05,120 --> 02:24:05,970
you,
you have to,

3239
02:24:05,971 --> 02:24:08,340
it has to be.
There's something that has to be fat

3240
02:24:08,341 --> 02:24:09,200
soluble.
Like,

3241
02:24:09,420 --> 02:24:11,790
like when you cook it,
like a lot of times they cook or they

3242
02:24:11,791 --> 02:24:13,760
use butter and they,
they,

3243
02:24:13,940 --> 02:24:17,280
they melt the marijuana into the butter
that make it fat soluble.

3244
02:24:17,281 --> 02:24:18,510
The make your body.
So,

3245
02:24:18,630 --> 02:24:19,860
I don't know the,
understand the process,

3246
02:24:19,861 --> 02:24:22,140
but he figured out how to do it and put
it into capsule forms.

3247
02:24:22,440 --> 02:24:23,460
So he told us,
he was like,

3248
02:24:23,970 --> 02:24:24,870
Yo,
how much should I take?

3249
02:24:25,260 --> 02:24:27,120
And he goes,
just take one pill because they're a

3250
02:24:27,121 --> 02:24:28,680
little packages of two pills that he
gave us.

3251
02:24:28,880 --> 02:24:31,320
It was just take one.
And my friend Eddie Bravo was like,

3252
02:24:31,680 --> 02:24:32,880
fuck that guy.
I'm taking it too.

3253
02:24:33,150 --> 02:24:34,380
So he took two.
I listened.

3254
02:24:34,410 --> 02:24:39,410
I took one and I was fucking the
blitzkrieg and I wound up talking to

3255
02:24:41,371 --> 02:24:44,940
this guy and um,
it was at a Jujitsu tournament and this

3256
02:24:44,941 --> 02:24:47,850
guy was one of the competitors.
And I remember thinking like,

3257
02:24:47,851 --> 02:24:50,520
wow,
this guy's vibe is so crazy.

3258
02:24:50,521 --> 02:24:52,280
Like he's giving me like,
when you really hot,

3259
02:24:52,500 --> 02:24:56,820
maybe it was just because I'm that high,
like insanely dangerous vibe about him.

3260
02:24:57,750 --> 02:25:01,980
Turns out he was a rapist,
turned into a rapist and um,

3261
02:25:02,400 --> 02:25:04,520
uh,
was on the run and uh,

3262
02:25:04,530 --> 02:25:07,260
went on the run and we went to a Jujitsu
tournament.

3263
02:25:07,520 --> 02:25:07,800
No,
no,

3264
02:25:07,800 --> 02:25:08,630
no.
He was,

3265
02:25:08,630 --> 02:25:11,490
he was a rapist.
He had done some other shit too.

3266
02:25:11,700 --> 02:25:14,910
One of the things he had done,
he had choked to death and then they

3267
02:25:14,911 --> 02:25:19,660
revived him.
He got in a street fight on a traffic

3268
02:25:19,661 --> 02:25:21,720
incident.
One of those mayhem or whatever.

3269
02:25:21,730 --> 02:25:22,563
Those.
No,

3270
02:25:22,590 --> 02:25:23,540
no,
I'm,

3271
02:25:23,600 --> 02:25:24,433
I'm forgetting.

3272
02:25:24,940 --> 02:25:27,380
I forget her name.
More machines now.

3273
02:25:27,460 --> 02:25:30,370
That was another one.
He was on my podcast and actually just a

3274
02:25:30,370 --> 02:25:33,540
couple months before he did that with
the girl that he beat the fuck out if

3275
02:25:33,541 --> 02:25:35,020
she was here.
Oh God.

3276
02:25:35,021 --> 02:25:38,650
That's the worst sounding story I ever.
I saw the whole thing on real sports.

3277
02:25:38,651 --> 02:25:39,600
They did it.
Yeah.

3278
02:25:39,601 --> 02:25:43,210
I did.
On real sports on HBO is terrible.

3279
02:25:43,730 --> 02:25:44,860
Yeah,
that was terrible.

3280
02:25:45,310 --> 02:25:50,310
That whole thing was a combination of
everything is all the abuse that he

3281
02:25:50,741 --> 02:25:52,540
suffered in his life.
Steroids,

3282
02:25:52,660 --> 02:25:56,260
this fucking brain damage that he
unquestionably has.

3283
02:25:56,800 --> 02:25:59,700
So many of them have.
Brain damage is so many fighters.

3284
02:25:59,800 --> 02:26:02,530
Same Shit.
The football players.

3285
02:26:02,531 --> 02:26:06,410
Yeah.
They snap the chronic and syphilis.

3286
02:26:06,430 --> 02:26:07,263
Yep.
Yeah.

3287
02:26:07,500 --> 02:26:08,110
Try it.
Well,

3288
02:26:08,110 --> 02:26:11,400
cte,
so just any form of head trauma over

3289
02:26:11,401 --> 02:26:13,900
repeated periods of time.
Scared cause issues,

3290
02:26:13,960 --> 02:26:16,780
but they keep talking about football
players and like you can't tell me that

3291
02:26:16,781 --> 02:26:18,460
like Nascar drivers don't have that
shit.

3292
02:26:18,670 --> 02:26:20,770
They reckon you have concussions all the
time.

3293
02:26:21,700 --> 02:26:23,200
I don't think they were rick that much
though,

3294
02:26:24,500 --> 02:26:26,730
but it just takes a little like once
it's,

3295
02:26:26,740 --> 02:26:29,050
you know,
once you've had one concussion it's

3296
02:26:29,051 --> 02:26:32,800
easier to get another and a lot of those
drivers have had multiple concussions.

3297
02:26:32,830 --> 02:26:34,810
That's interesting.
I never really thought about that.

3298
02:26:34,811 --> 02:26:36,940
I would think about different people
like hockey.

3299
02:26:37,610 --> 02:26:38,530
Sure.
Certainly.

3300
02:26:38,531 --> 02:26:40,330
But it always seems to go to just
football.

3301
02:26:40,331 --> 02:26:41,164
But you're like,
no,

3302
02:26:41,170 --> 02:26:42,700
this.
I mean I know plenty.

3303
02:26:43,150 --> 02:26:45,960
I like car racing but like a lot of the
open will,

3304
02:26:47,050 --> 02:26:49,600
you know,
even if they have just a barely at rec,

3305
02:26:49,630 --> 02:26:51,400
but it's still there.
Had,

3306
02:26:51,610 --> 02:26:53,210
you know,
they have all the head neck restraints

3307
02:26:53,211 --> 02:26:55,180
on it,
but you hit the side of a wall,

3308
02:26:55,450 --> 02:26:59,350
you brand squash around.
You've already had three concussions

3309
02:26:59,351 --> 02:27:03,010
maybe in the past.
So with all the connective tissue,

3310
02:27:03,011 --> 02:27:06,100
the connective tissue that holds your
brain inside your skull,

3311
02:27:06,160 --> 02:27:07,180
that stuff tears.

3312
02:27:07,480 --> 02:27:09,080
And when it tears it doesn't come back.
Yeah.

3313
02:27:09,490 --> 02:27:10,330
Yeah.
I don't,

3314
02:27:10,350 --> 02:27:12,530
I resilient.
It's like it's done.

3315
02:27:13,060 --> 02:27:14,280
That's it.
I've,

3316
02:27:14,740 --> 02:27:16,780
I didn't know like what that stuff was
like,

3317
02:27:16,781 --> 02:27:21,330
like what is the connected tissue leg
until I butchered a moose once and uh,

3318
02:27:21,370 --> 02:27:22,510
yeah,
let's go right here.

3319
02:27:22,750 --> 02:27:26,050
And when we're lifting up the leg and
cutting the connective tissue,

3320
02:27:26,230 --> 02:27:28,540
it's like almost like this,
like candy,

3321
02:27:28,620 --> 02:27:29,650
like,
like,

3322
02:27:29,651 --> 02:27:30,730
uh,
what's that stuff called?

3323
02:27:30,731 --> 02:27:33,510
Cotton candy fibers look and stuff
that's like,

3324
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:36,970
it's so soft.
It just cuts right through.

3325
02:27:37,030 --> 02:27:37,841
It's like,
I'm like,

3326
02:27:37,841 --> 02:27:41,800
this is similar to the stuff that holds
your brain in your head and you can

3327
02:27:41,801 --> 02:27:46,480
imagine over repeated traumatic impacts
like over and over again.

3328
02:27:46,481 --> 02:27:48,400
That stuff would just start tearing and
breaking news.

3329
02:27:48,790 --> 02:27:51,190
And then once it's torn,
like you're fucked.

3330
02:27:51,250 --> 02:27:53,010
Like your head's just rattling around.
Yeah,

3331
02:27:53,800 --> 02:27:54,820
yeah.
Scary.

3332
02:27:54,960 --> 02:27:55,870
Well,
I have a friend of mine,

3333
02:27:55,871 --> 02:27:58,930
a good friend of mine who's an expert in
traumatic brain injuries.

3334
02:27:58,931 --> 02:28:01,600
He's a doctor and he treats a lot of
soldiers,

3335
02:28:01,601 --> 02:28:02,650
football players,
the like.

3336
02:28:03,070 --> 02:28:04,610
And he said that you can get a
concussion,

3337
02:28:04,630 --> 02:28:07,660
a severe concussion.
I'm getting hit in the chest like a lot

3338
02:28:07,661 --> 02:28:09,640
of football players,
they had impact.

3339
02:28:09,641 --> 02:28:11,590
They get hit in the chest,
but the,

3340
02:28:11,760 --> 02:28:16,760
that the chest snapped your head back
and your brain rattles around inside

3341
02:28:18,071 --> 02:28:21,410
your head and it gives you a massive
concussion and they,

3342
02:28:21,650 --> 02:28:22,310
the ignorant

3343
02:28:22,310 --> 02:28:23,630
people that didn't know any better,
you know,

3344
02:28:23,631 --> 02:28:26,160
ignorant as far as it didn't have the
information they would,

3345
02:28:26,320 --> 02:28:26,931
they would say,
oh,

3346
02:28:26,931 --> 02:28:28,220
I didn't even get hit in the head.
He's fine,

3347
02:28:28,700 --> 02:28:31,040
but no,
that just getting hit in the chest.

3348
02:28:31,041 --> 02:28:33,560
Like if someone kicks you in the chest,
you can get a concussion.

3349
02:28:34,730 --> 02:28:36,260
I hope nobody ever kicks me in the
chest.

3350
02:28:36,500 --> 02:28:40,790
I hope nobody kicks you in the chest to
not be a fan of that suck.

3351
02:28:41,240 --> 02:28:45,260
But if they did like you see your brain
gets fucked up.

3352
02:28:45,320 --> 02:28:46,760
Have you ever had a concussion?
Oh yeah.

3353
02:28:46,761 --> 02:28:49,490
I'm sure you're sure,
but you don't know for a fact that you

3354
02:28:49,491 --> 02:28:53,330
had one piece of kickbox.
So did you ever have where you were at

3355
02:28:53,331 --> 02:28:54,890
the hospital and they said,
no,

3356
02:28:55,340 --> 02:28:56,600
no,
no,

3357
02:28:56,601 --> 02:29:00,260
but I definitely had headaches and get
punched in the head a bunch of times.

3358
02:29:00,710 --> 02:29:02,830
I've been hit in the head a gang at
times.

3359
02:29:02,960 --> 02:29:06,620
I'm just definitely in.
Here's the thing about concussions and

3360
02:29:06,680 --> 02:29:09,560
traumatic brain injury,
like people think that it's just a

3361
02:29:09,561 --> 02:29:10,740
concussion.
Uh,

3362
02:29:10,741 --> 02:29:13,880
you are concussed and defined
concussion,

3363
02:29:13,940 --> 02:29:14,301
you know,
oh,

3364
02:29:14,301 --> 02:29:16,520
your pupils are dilated and you get hit
in the head.

3365
02:29:16,930 --> 02:29:19,040
No,
you like small impacts,

3366
02:29:19,041 --> 02:29:23,060
repeated subconcussive impacts.
Sometimes I have the most devastating

3367
02:29:23,061 --> 02:29:26,150
effect.
Like soccer players oftentimes develop

3368
02:29:26,450 --> 02:29:28,820
the same sort of symptoms from heading
the ball.

3369
02:29:28,910 --> 02:29:30,770
Just a ball,
bouncing a ball off your head.

3370
02:29:30,771 --> 02:29:31,604
No concussion.

3371
02:29:31,920 --> 02:29:33,000
I would have,
um,

3372
02:29:33,510 --> 02:29:36,960
I've never had a concussion,
but I assume that I've done damage from

3373
02:29:37,230 --> 02:29:38,820
surfing or wakeboarding.
Oh yeah,

3374
02:29:39,240 --> 02:29:40,160
yeah,
yeah.

3375
02:29:40,750 --> 02:29:41,910
Like,
you know,

3376
02:29:42,080 --> 02:29:44,430
you would know it.
Take you a minute.

3377
02:29:44,460 --> 02:29:46,800
Like you really wipe out and you're just
like laying there,

3378
02:29:46,801 --> 02:29:49,590
like
take a deep breath.

3379
02:29:49,591 --> 02:29:50,221
Like,
okay,

3380
02:29:50,221 --> 02:29:53,630
I'm going to sit the next few.
Dr Mark Gordon

3381
02:29:53,630 --> 02:29:55,880
was saying that you can get it from
wakeboarding or I'm not.

3382
02:29:55,881 --> 02:29:57,260
Sorry,
I'm jet skiing.

3383
02:29:57,520 --> 02:29:58,530
Just hitting weights

3384
02:29:59,700 --> 02:30:00,830
jarring.
Exactly.

3385
02:30:00,900 --> 02:30:02,560
It really like when you hit,
if you're,

3386
02:30:02,860 --> 02:30:04,930
you know,
every time I'd be out on the boat or

3387
02:30:04,931 --> 02:30:07,240
somebody that you go into a wave and
that kind of like,

3388
02:30:07,420 --> 02:30:08,470
boom,
yeah,

3389
02:30:08,471 --> 02:30:10,270
it's good enough.
Fuck,

3390
02:30:10,271 --> 02:30:12,100
you get off the boat and you're just
like kind of.

3391
02:30:12,420 --> 02:30:13,870
We could fill a little rattled.
Yeah,

3392
02:30:13,930 --> 02:30:15,070
exactly.
Yeah,

3393
02:30:15,250 --> 02:30:17,050
that Shit's bad for you.
Not Good.

3394
02:30:17,290 --> 02:30:18,190
Not Good.

3395
02:30:18,850 --> 02:30:22,570
I would imagine ski jumping,
ship boom.

3396
02:30:22,571 --> 02:30:25,770
Like that.
All those fucking downhill skiers like

3397
02:30:25,780 --> 02:30:29,080
the ones that the Olympics and the fuck,
they wiped the fuck out.

3398
02:30:29,081 --> 02:30:31,750
Oh,
they fucking wipe out those a

3399
02:30:32,030 --> 02:30:33,070
snowboarder.
Dudes do.

3400
02:30:33,180 --> 02:30:34,360
Oh,
they wipe out hard.

3401
02:30:34,510 --> 02:30:37,570
My friend who got knocked out recently
fucking snowboarding.

3402
02:30:37,760 --> 02:30:39,430
He.
You ever seen that document up on his

3403
02:30:39,431 --> 02:30:42,670
back?
Oh really has no idea what the fuck you

3404
02:30:42,671 --> 02:30:44,080
did?
Just woke up.

3405
02:30:44,520 --> 02:30:48,370
It was fucked up for awhile.
But this is like a second or third time

3406
02:30:48,371 --> 02:30:50,640
going out like that too.
Like falling snowboard.

3407
02:30:50,641 --> 02:30:53,010
He loves snowboarding though.
But Jesus

3408
02:30:53,520 --> 02:30:56,060
point again,
like I like walking and breathing and

3409
02:30:56,520 --> 02:30:58,590
living on my own.
Remembering where I live.

3410
02:31:00,320 --> 02:31:01,830
Not having somebody like,
you know,

3411
02:31:01,890 --> 02:31:03,460
take me to the bathroom.
Like,

3412
02:31:04,350 --> 02:31:06,450
well for football players you've seen
those.

3413
02:31:06,660 --> 02:31:08,610
If you've seen the real sports episode.
I am

3414
02:31:08,690 --> 02:31:12,310
NFL players from the seventies and
eighties that are just jobs.

3415
02:31:13,600 --> 02:31:15,150
Well,
the one I saw,

3416
02:31:15,170 --> 02:31:18,960
it was a pbs frontline that was about
those concussions and,

3417
02:31:19,410 --> 02:31:20,280
and it was,
I mean,

3418
02:31:21,360 --> 02:31:23,640
the guy's just,
they're not the same person,

3419
02:31:23,820 --> 02:31:26,610
they're just fucked.
I mean they've just done a number on

3420
02:31:26,611 --> 02:31:31,611
their bodies and you don't bounce back
after so many just hoping that one day

3421
02:31:32,251 --> 02:31:35,340
they're going to figure out how to
inject stem cells in your brain or

3422
02:31:35,341 --> 02:31:38,060
something like that to reinvigorate it.
But yeah,

3423
02:31:38,160 --> 02:31:40,020
as of right now,
they really can't do much.

3424
02:31:40,060 --> 02:31:41,670
Are you a football fan?
Not really,

3425
02:31:41,700 --> 02:31:42,780
no,
but like growing up.

3426
02:31:42,781 --> 02:31:43,840
Okay.
So you know,

3427
02:31:43,880 --> 02:31:47,910
you think about you'd see a big hit,
it would make this know wide world of

3428
02:31:47,911 --> 02:31:49,530
sports real or some shit like that.
And you're like,

3429
02:31:50,210 --> 02:31:51,960
do you want to watch it again?
It's just insane.

3430
02:31:51,961 --> 02:31:53,190
And everyone's like,
yeah,

3431
02:31:53,191 --> 02:31:55,710
and they're fucking and now I see it.
And I'm like,

3432
02:31:56,640 --> 02:31:58,890
yeah,
that guy that just shaved about 10 years

3433
02:31:58,910 --> 02:32:00,030
old,
you know,

3434
02:32:00,040 --> 02:32:04,090
like,
and he's probably lost however many lost

3435
02:32:04,170 --> 02:32:07,350
whatever function of his brain that they
say is like your emotions and your

3436
02:32:07,351 --> 02:32:09,930
decision making.
And that's why a lot of those guys will

3437
02:32:10,260 --> 02:32:13,560
shoot their girlfriend killed themselves
and we're going to show one jamie.

3438
02:32:16,290 --> 02:32:17,123
Oh,

3439
02:32:17,240 --> 02:32:20,230
oh.
And then you can always tell my guys

3440
02:32:20,240 --> 02:32:21,080
this recent.
Jamie.

3441
02:32:21,530 --> 02:32:22,910
Yeah.
This was two weeks ago.

3442
02:32:23,390 --> 02:32:25,670
You can tell the knockout when the hand
stamp.

3443
02:32:25,760 --> 02:32:27,000
Oh yeah.
No,

3444
02:32:27,210 --> 02:32:28,260
believe me.
I know,

3445
02:32:28,410 --> 02:32:30,300
I've seen.
I've probably seen more people get

3446
02:32:30,301 --> 02:32:35,230
knocked unconscious in real life then I
would,

3447
02:32:35,330 --> 02:32:37,140
I would,
I would really,

3448
02:32:37,170 --> 02:32:42,170
without any reservation say that I've
seen more people get knocked out then

3449
02:32:44,960 --> 02:32:46,590
zero,
zero point one,

3450
02:32:46,591 --> 02:32:48,080
one,
one percent of the population.

3451
02:32:48,081 --> 02:32:51,630
I'm like in the,
like the smallest group of people,

3452
02:32:52,320 --> 02:32:57,320
like there's maybe a hundred or 200
people on the planet that have seen more

3453
02:32:57,421 --> 02:32:59,070
people get knocked out than me.
Maybe

3454
02:32:59,980 --> 02:33:03,130
I've seen people get knocked out not to
that extent,

3455
02:33:03,131 --> 02:33:07,210
but because of my sports producer I used
to have to actually go to all the games.

3456
02:33:07,390 --> 02:33:08,690
So I'd be on the sideline,
you know,

3457
02:33:08,760 --> 02:33:11,200
like.
So I saw it,

3458
02:33:11,201 --> 02:33:12,430
you know,
like right there up close.

3459
02:33:12,431 --> 02:33:14,840
And it is,
I mean you just see it coming.

3460
02:33:14,870 --> 02:33:17,740
You could see the guy coming.
You can see his head turned the other

3461
02:33:17,741 --> 02:33:19,690
way,
has no idea what's you know,

3462
02:33:19,900 --> 02:33:23,020
and then the moment he just lays down
those arms just oh yeah,

3463
02:33:23,110 --> 02:33:24,110
they just stay up until like

3464
02:33:24,430 --> 02:33:26,200
fuck.
Well because of doing commentary for the

3465
02:33:26,201 --> 02:33:28,930
UFC,
I mean literally I've seen more

3466
02:33:28,931 --> 02:33:32,620
knockouts than way more than 99 percent
of the population.

3467
02:33:32,980 --> 02:33:34,850
It's probably like 99 point nine,
nine,

3468
02:33:34,860 --> 02:33:35,693
nine,
nine.

3469
02:33:35,800 --> 02:33:38,440
There might be,
there might be 20 people on earth that

3470
02:33:38,441 --> 02:33:40,030
have seen more people get knocked out
than me.

3471
02:33:40,031 --> 02:33:42,970
It might really be that low because how
long have you been doing that?

3472
02:33:43,240 --> 02:33:45,940
I've done.
I started doing the commentary from 97

3473
02:33:46,420 --> 02:33:50,640
and I started again.
I did it from 97 and 98.

3474
02:33:50,690 --> 02:33:54,070
Then I quit and then came back in 2002
with the new company and I've been doing

3475
02:33:54,071 --> 02:33:56,980
it for the last 14 years.
But you've seen a lot of.

3476
02:33:57,090 --> 02:34:00,760
But I also was fighting from the time I
was 15,

3477
02:34:00,910 --> 02:34:05,590
so was 15 to 22 was all kick boxing and
martial arts.

3478
02:34:05,740 --> 02:34:10,300
So I saw a lot of people get knocked out
in person there and then I saw was just

3479
02:34:10,420 --> 02:34:12,050
fucking done.
God called like,

3480
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:15,610
I don't know man.
It's way more than a thousand fights.

3481
02:34:15,640 --> 02:34:20,640
It's probably close to 2000.
So I've probably seen five or 600 people

3482
02:34:22,121 --> 02:34:25,650
just get shut off.
Just wham.

3483
02:34:25,870 --> 02:34:28,120
Over the course of my life.
Just Bong,

3484
02:34:28,360 --> 02:34:30,760
crying,
stiff arms,

3485
02:34:30,820 --> 02:34:32,680
legs twitching,
toes curled.

3486
02:34:32,681 --> 02:34:35,200
I've seen that way more than 100 times,
200,

3487
02:34:35,201 --> 02:34:37,680
300 times.
Yeah.

3488
02:34:37,770 --> 02:34:39,060
It's madness.
When you really stop,

3489
02:34:39,180 --> 02:34:42,750
think about it.
I mean it's weird that like going from

3490
02:34:42,751 --> 02:34:44,910
something I would watch and be like,
oh,

3491
02:34:45,030 --> 02:34:46,920
you know,
watch it again to like,

3492
02:34:46,950 --> 02:34:48,510
now I'm just going,
Jeez,

3493
02:34:48,750 --> 02:34:50,030
you know,
me too.

3494
02:34:51,160 --> 02:34:52,500
We're getting old.
It's not fun anymore.

3495
02:34:52,530 --> 02:34:53,190
Well,
it's

3496
02:34:53,190 --> 02:34:56,920
becoming more and more aware.
And plus like the knew will smith movie

3497
02:34:56,950 --> 02:35:01,950
concussions coming out where people are
starting to say no I haven't.

3498
02:35:02,111 --> 02:35:02,820
Is it out already?

3499
02:35:02,820 --> 02:35:03,930
Yeah.
Came on over Christmas,

3500
02:35:04,420 --> 02:35:08,490
but I didn't do.
I don't think what it should have.

3501
02:35:08,860 --> 02:35:10,830
Yeah.
I read something that there was like

3502
02:35:10,831 --> 02:35:14,820
this long thing of discrepancies,
like they chose to leave out because

3503
02:35:14,821 --> 02:35:16,020
supposed to be a true story,
you know,

3504
02:35:16,021 --> 02:35:16,560
and,
and they,

3505
02:35:16,560 --> 02:35:20,370
they admitted very important facts.
Oh look,

3506
02:35:20,371 --> 02:35:24,990
because of the nfl of how they treated,
you know,

3507
02:35:24,991 --> 02:35:28,360
like there are certain things that I
don't know who got behind what and like

3508
02:35:28,380 --> 02:35:32,460
who kind of strong arm,
strong arm them into like doing what

3509
02:35:33,060 --> 02:35:36,090
leave that part out,
but that part in or maybe try to avoid

3510
02:35:36,091 --> 02:35:40,620
lawsuits to something like that.
But I mean I used to think when I would

3511
02:35:40,621 --> 02:35:42,990
hear people like,
I mean I grew up in Texas too,

3512
02:35:42,991 --> 02:35:46,500
so football was such a big thing.
And how there would be people that would

3513
02:35:46,501 --> 02:35:47,011
say,
oh,

3514
02:35:47,011 --> 02:35:48,900
I'd never,
I'm not letting my son play football and

3515
02:35:48,950 --> 02:35:53,040
your pussy and I get it now.
Like I don't have kids,

3516
02:35:53,041 --> 02:35:55,920
but I would say I get it.
Like you see the results in these

3517
02:35:55,921 --> 02:35:57,360
people.
It just fogged.

3518
02:35:57,590 --> 02:35:58,870
I get it.
Yeah.

3519
02:35:59,510 --> 02:36:03,700
Well I mean if boy,
if my kids wanted to fight,

3520
02:36:04,120 --> 02:36:06,370
I would be very conservative about it.
I'd have to.

3521
02:36:06,670 --> 02:36:10,660
I'd have to really try to get it into
their head to understand defense before

3522
02:36:10,661 --> 02:36:13,060
anything really.
You have to like the most important

3523
02:36:13,061 --> 02:36:15,760
thing to practice is learning how to
avoid being hit and how to.

3524
02:36:15,970 --> 02:36:17,350
Yeah.
I mean I took like,

3525
02:36:17,370 --> 02:36:18,970
I took karate as a kid,
everything,

3526
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:21,040
but you know,
my dad was like,

3527
02:36:21,041 --> 02:36:22,300
you never start a fight.
He's like,

3528
02:36:22,301 --> 02:36:24,220
but if somebody ever tried to hurt you,
he's like,

3529
02:36:24,221 --> 02:36:26,200
Jimmy,
I just punched him right in the nose and

3530
02:36:26,201 --> 02:36:29,410
keep doing it until like,
but defend yourself,

3531
02:36:29,411 --> 02:36:30,490
don't,
you know,

3532
02:36:30,491 --> 02:36:33,620
don't dance around them and talk shit,
you know.

3533
02:36:34,230 --> 02:36:35,620
And I was like,
okay,

3534
02:36:35,660 --> 02:36:38,200
well avoiding fights is always to get in
a fight.

3535
02:36:39,390 --> 02:36:40,780
Don't hit me.
I'd be so upset.

3536
02:36:42,230 --> 02:36:45,820
Why don't you do that?
Well just if you didn't avoid it and you

3537
02:36:45,821 --> 02:36:47,590
got hurt,
badly hurt.

3538
02:36:47,620 --> 02:36:49,360
Yeah.
And something you could have avoided it

3539
02:36:49,450 --> 02:36:51,520
feel so stupid.
It would have been forever.

3540
02:36:51,670 --> 02:36:53,020
Yeah.
That you're the one that started it and

3541
02:36:53,021 --> 02:36:55,960
then you get the shit kicked out of you.
Cooler heads.

3542
02:36:55,961 --> 02:36:58,990
Prevail is always a good thing to focus
on.

3543
02:36:59,800 --> 02:37:01,420
It's just sad.

3544
02:37:02,010 --> 02:37:04,660
It's almost always whatever the fuck it
is that people fight over,

3545
02:37:04,661 --> 02:37:06,370
it's almost always going to be worked
out.

3546
02:37:06,790 --> 02:37:10,570
Most of the time.
People just want to fight when they're

3547
02:37:10,571 --> 02:37:14,470
drunk and that's the difference between
alcohol and pot.

3548
02:37:14,740 --> 02:37:16,610
Nobody fought at the Cannabis Cup,

3549
02:37:17,600 --> 02:37:20,330
those fucking people,
and even had a fight that day.

3550
02:37:21,800 --> 02:37:25,170
I want to just grab it.
Let's just slowly answer for say,

3551
02:37:25,990 --> 02:37:29,270
Hey,
slow dance me and you man talk.

3552
02:37:29,540 --> 02:37:30,970
Come on man.
I don't know what to tell you about,

3553
02:37:30,980 --> 02:37:34,770
but let's talk.
Fuck the people come out of a bar to

3554
02:37:35,930 --> 02:37:38,180
fire it up.
It is the worst drug when it comes to

3555
02:37:38,181 --> 02:37:39,014
that.
The worst,

3556
02:37:39,300 --> 02:37:43,040
the worst job because it narrows your
understanding of the danger that you're

3557
02:37:43,041 --> 02:37:47,630
involved in.
Loosens inhibition impedes rational

3558
02:37:47,631 --> 02:37:51,290
thinking and it's always somebody that's
so fucking hammered,

3559
02:37:51,760 --> 02:37:53,570
but they can't even put one foot in
front of the other,

3560
02:37:53,571 --> 02:37:58,040
but in their mind they're seeing
something completely different and they

3561
02:37:58,041 --> 02:37:59,750
always end up getting the shit knocked
out of them.

3562
02:37:59,960 --> 02:38:02,270
I've seen it,
seen it a bunch of times.

3563
02:38:02,300 --> 02:38:04,210
It's horrible.
It's seen.

3564
02:38:04,250 --> 02:38:07,580
Street fights is always so strange too
because sometimes you see street fights

3565
02:38:07,581 --> 02:38:10,760
with people that are so confident and
they literally have no idea how to fight

3566
02:38:10,790 --> 02:38:11,900
and you're like,
why are you so?

3567
02:38:11,990 --> 02:38:13,320
What are you doing?
You don't even.

3568
02:38:13,410 --> 02:38:15,920
Maybe they beat up somebody that was
really scrawny.

3569
02:38:16,930 --> 02:38:20,570
They're like,
it's going to happen to get that good

3570
02:38:20,690 --> 02:38:23,240
God.
Look at that big giant bouncer.

3571
02:38:23,360 --> 02:38:28,360
I got this and you're.
I always want to like if you ever met

3572
02:38:28,521 --> 02:38:31,640
someone that like they become a
different person when they get drunk,

3573
02:38:32,080 --> 02:38:33,970
they drink and then like a switch goes
off.

3574
02:38:33,971 --> 02:38:34,641
If they're not,
they're like,

3575
02:38:34,641 --> 02:38:36,230
hey,
when Jenny go with Jenny,

3576
02:38:36,320 --> 02:38:38,360
Jenny in there,
and those eyes are just like,

3577
02:38:38,460 --> 02:38:41,540
they get gerbils,
hamsters and then you say something,

3578
02:38:41,610 --> 02:38:44,450
then it's usually the people that get
mad really easily.

3579
02:38:45,230 --> 02:38:49,550
We were just having fun like,
well fuck this shit,

3580
02:38:49,760 --> 02:38:51,860
fuck this fuck of.
And was looking at me.

3581
02:38:51,890 --> 02:38:53,090
Yeah,
because your drink's empty.

3582
02:38:53,120 --> 02:38:56,320
Like
what the hell happened to you?

3583
02:38:56,540 --> 02:38:59,180
Where'd you go?
Kind of amazing that.

3584
02:38:59,240 --> 02:39:01,070
So few fights do take place.

3585
02:39:01,070 --> 02:39:04,130
When you think about how much alcohol is
available and how many people drink,

3586
02:39:04,190 --> 02:39:06,860
it's kind of amazing when you go out and
you don't see a fight,

3587
02:39:07,190 --> 02:39:08,710
which is more often than not.
Right?

3588
02:39:08,720 --> 02:39:12,110
Depends on where you're at.
I think when I was in Austin,

3589
02:39:12,111 --> 02:39:14,390
so you've got on sixth street and it's a
good place.

3590
02:39:15,530 --> 02:39:18,200
It was.
It would be weird to not see a fight on

3591
02:39:18,201 --> 02:39:20,930
sixth street,
but then if you go to a place that's

3592
02:39:20,931 --> 02:39:21,800
like a nicer,
you know,

3593
02:39:21,830 --> 02:39:24,890
okay,
these are adults instead of a bunch of

3594
02:39:24,891 --> 02:39:29,150
just college kids that are ripped.
You don't see as many,

3595
02:39:29,151 --> 02:39:31,400
but that's true.
I saw a lot in Austin.

3596
02:39:31,401 --> 02:39:33,380
That was pretty,
pretty common.

3597
02:39:33,690 --> 02:39:36,770
Well,
college towns and then you got Texas

3598
02:39:36,771 --> 02:39:39,620
people and then he got booze and you
throw it all together.

3599
02:39:40,130 --> 02:39:41,600
A lot of fucking Johan.

3600
02:39:43,780 --> 02:39:45,830
It's a great town though.
I love great town.

3601
02:39:46,100 --> 02:39:48,110
A town.
It's getting choked up with people

3602
02:39:48,111 --> 02:39:50,150
though these days.
Everybody wants to live there now.

3603
02:39:50,210 --> 02:39:51,440
Why is that?
Don't know.

3604
02:39:52,460 --> 02:39:55,430
It's cool as shit to do.
It's a nice place.

3605
02:39:55,431 --> 02:39:56,920
That was fun.
Like I said,

3606
02:39:56,921 --> 02:39:58,330
it's a good atmosphere.
It's not.

3607
02:39:58,331 --> 02:40:00,500
I think it's laid back that help
traffic.

3608
02:40:00,501 --> 02:40:01,450
There's insane.
No,

3609
02:40:01,680 --> 02:40:04,040
yeah,
that's started becoming like just.

3610
02:40:04,120 --> 02:40:05,480
Yeah,
it's overwhelming.

3611
02:40:05,720 --> 02:40:08,720
Their infrastructure can't really handle
it because it's not designed for that

3612
02:40:08,721 --> 02:40:11,600
many people and,
and everything's consistently under

3613
02:40:11,720 --> 02:40:13,860
construction that never get,
you know,

3614
02:40:13,861 --> 02:40:16,410
it's just like everything.
There's just,

3615
02:40:16,470 --> 02:40:18,840
you know,
they're all going gonna be a new

3616
02:40:18,841 --> 02:40:20,060
building that's going to be it.
Okay.

3617
02:40:20,080 --> 02:40:22,230
So we have to close that street off and
that straight offs.

3618
02:40:22,530 --> 02:40:23,610
Traffic's now worse.

3619
02:40:26,020 --> 02:40:30,390
It's a problem.
But it is a very unique city in Texas

3620
02:40:30,391 --> 02:40:33,240
too because it's got its own vibe to it
as opposed to.

3621
02:40:33,880 --> 02:40:35,220
Yeah,
I mean this is the capital,

3622
02:40:35,490 --> 02:40:38,640
but it's got its own vibe to it that's
different than any other Texas city.

3623
02:40:38,641 --> 02:40:41,190
It's so liberal and open minded and
sweared.

3624
02:40:41,760 --> 02:40:46,760
I mean I think that like I worked
downtown and where the office,

3625
02:40:46,980 --> 02:40:49,500
where our station was was right there
next to the capital,

3626
02:40:49,740 --> 02:40:51,870
so it was kinda cool.
It was on Congress and you could walk

3627
02:40:51,871 --> 02:40:52,704
around.
It was,

3628
02:40:52,770 --> 02:40:55,170
you know,
I didn't live very far.

3629
02:40:55,171 --> 02:40:58,510
I mean I was still young so I had a
little cool dope ass little high rise,

3630
02:40:58,511 --> 02:41:00,150
you know,
it was fun,

3631
02:41:00,630 --> 02:41:03,960
but I,
I feel like every time I go back it's

3632
02:41:03,961 --> 02:41:06,660
just thousands more people.
Oh yeah.

3633
02:41:07,020 --> 02:41:10,470
We'll do some nutty number of people
move there every day.

3634
02:41:10,950 --> 02:41:13,500
It was like a thousand people moved
there everyday or something like that.

3635
02:41:13,510 --> 02:41:15,930
Something insane.
Something really ridiculous.

3636
02:41:15,931 --> 02:41:19,590
And it is sprawling because you can go
out towards the lakes and all those kind

3637
02:41:19,591 --> 02:41:21,550
of houses.
How many people move to Austin every

3638
02:41:21,551 --> 02:41:22,384
day?
Google that.

3639
02:41:22,440 --> 02:41:24,990
I bet there's a statistic,
but yeah,

3640
02:41:24,991 --> 02:41:27,510
by the lake will the lakes.
They used to be two lakes,

3641
02:41:27,511 --> 02:41:28,320
right?
Lake Austin,

3642
02:41:28,320 --> 02:41:32,640
Lake Travis and Lake Travis had fucking
become nothing but there was town lake

3643
02:41:32,670 --> 02:41:34,680
and then yeah,
like travis is now,

3644
02:41:34,681 --> 02:41:37,740
like just speed boats.
Everybody filled up again.

3645
02:41:37,770 --> 02:41:40,260
It was down to nothing and it rained so
hard.

3646
02:41:40,261 --> 02:41:43,320
It filled back up again.
That was pretty fucked up because nobody

3647
02:41:43,321 --> 02:41:46,560
could even get in the water due to the
bacteria.

3648
02:41:46,561 --> 02:41:48,450
It's only 110.
One hundred and 50.

3649
02:41:49,770 --> 02:41:52,080
That's it.
That's nothing.

3650
02:41:53,330 --> 02:41:55,950
Oh,
when for 2014.

3651
02:41:56,640 --> 02:42:01,200
So two years ago,
how much much difference to that doesn't

3652
02:42:01,201 --> 02:42:06,201
seem like a lot though because 150
people move in and 40 people move out.

3653
02:42:07,500 --> 02:42:11,730
So it's 110 net.
That doesn't seem that bad.

3654
02:42:11,790 --> 02:42:14,380
But it is over the course of years.
Right?

3655
02:42:15,910 --> 02:42:20,280
Yeah.
Well so much for my fucking outrageous

3656
02:42:20,290 --> 02:42:21,690
hyperbole,
hyperbole.

3657
02:42:21,770 --> 02:42:23,970
Kinda almost.
It is almost.

3658
02:42:24,180 --> 02:42:25,680
Almost close.
Yeah.

3659
02:42:26,890 --> 02:42:28,290
Close enough.
It's sucks.

3660
02:42:28,350 --> 02:42:30,600
Three hundred 60,000 people a year.
No,

3661
02:42:30,630 --> 02:42:35,630
week 50 2:52 weeks.
One of my shitty math again.

3662
02:42:38,340 --> 02:42:40,200
Boy.
Fucking relying on calculators.

3663
02:42:40,260 --> 02:42:43,320
Oh Man.
I have to rely on calculators.

3664
02:42:43,350 --> 02:42:44,880
So we're almost out of time.
Jenny Johnson.

3665
02:42:44,881 --> 02:42:45,920
High Five.
