1
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:06,720
Oh Shit, you dirty bitches internationally
known and locally recognized.

2
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:10,380
Just recently escaped from
the government of Canada,

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,980
snuck across the border
back to the United States.

4
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,590
You must be so tired back
to the belly of the beast.

5
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:20,400
Back to the inside of the balls of
the Dick. That's fucking the world.

6
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:26,400
America. I fucking love Montreal
dude. I'm a little tired,

7
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:27,234
but we'll talk more.

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,000
The Joe Rogan experience is
brought to you by several things,

9
00:00:30,001 --> 00:00:32,280
but before that full even
bring them the sponsors.

10
00:00:32,281 --> 00:00:35,820
I want to thank Green Mountain grills
for hooking me up with this fucking bad

11
00:00:35,821 --> 00:00:39,930
ass grill hooked me up with one of these
pellet grills. It's hardwood pellets.

12
00:00:39,931 --> 00:00:42,470
They essentially take saw dust and they,
they,

13
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,470
they make these pellets out of it and
they use it to power your grill and it all

14
00:00:46,471 --> 00:00:48,870
goes through.
It's all electrically fed.

15
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:52,950
So it keeps the temperature exactly
the same. Apparently all these, um,

16
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:57,150
this dude Eric who set it up gave
me the four, the four one one,

17
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:00,150
all these grills that they use
for these barbecue competitions,

18
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,950
they all use pellet grills now.

19
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:05,970
And the way these pellet grills work
is you don't have to light anything.

20
00:01:05,971 --> 00:01:09,090
You don't have to fucking use
lighter fluid, but it's still wood.

21
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:14,390
And what it does is it all gets done in
cities like I hot coil and slowly but

22
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:18,030
surely the pellets get fed
through a machine to the hot coil.

23
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,920
It stays the same temperature.

24
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:24,390
Do I made some of the best fucking steaks
I've ever made on this thing? How long,

25
00:01:24,391 --> 00:01:27,520
how long did it appellate's last?
Are they like one time user? I do,

26
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:30,240
you know [inaudible] he turns
to dust and vacuum it out.

27
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:34,140
It just like it just like charcoal dust
and then just buy new bags of pellets.

28
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,920
And it's amazing how efficient it is.
It's like one like little,

29
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:42,280
like you could take a couple of cups
full of pellets and you can cook a couple

30
00:01:42,281 --> 00:01:43,020
of steaks.

31
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,260
Whereas if you think about how much
charcoal it takes because it's not that

32
00:01:46,261 --> 00:01:49,170
efficient, you know when you
throw on the charcoal in there,

33
00:01:49,171 --> 00:01:52,550
a lot of the heats lost to this
works in a convection of and way.

34
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:57,690
So as you close the lid on it and all
my God, it's so juicy and delicious. Oh,

35
00:01:57,691 --> 00:02:01,470
what's the, what's the website I want to
look? That's a good question. It's uh,

36
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,130
they're called green mountain grills.
Oh, it's green mountain grills.com. Um,

37
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:09,350
I got the one called the Daniel Boone.
There's a,

38
00:02:09,351 --> 00:02:11,070
there's a couple of different models,

39
00:02:11,071 --> 00:02:14,790
but you can cook like
shoulders on these things.

40
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:18,270
Like you could do like crazy shit
like cook, like briskets and stuff,

41
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,210
like stuff that you would never do because
you're not going to be the smart guy

42
00:02:21,211 --> 00:02:25,380
who's out there like knowing exactly
how much fire wood to put in the thing.

43
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:26,261
Cause you know,
if you,

44
00:02:26,261 --> 00:02:30,270
if you're like smoking something that
traditional way you like have a box and

45
00:02:30,271 --> 00:02:33,690
you've got to keep throwing wood
in it, that shit's wack. Okay.

46
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:36,660
You've got to get up in the middle of
the night and go put some wood in there

47
00:02:36,661 --> 00:02:40,080
because you're fucking, your meats are
going to get cold. That's stupid as fuck.

48
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,100
You don't have to do that anymore.

49
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,110
Although there is something
pretty bad ass about that.

50
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,530
There's something like very
a craftsmen about that,

51
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,810
about getting up in the middle of
the night and stoking the fire.

52
00:02:48,811 --> 00:02:52,110
Apparently there's this place in Austin,
Texas that has barbecue.

53
00:02:52,111 --> 00:02:56,970
That's fucking insane are you should fear
went there and I saw it on the Anthony

54
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:00,910
Bourdain show too. It started off as a
food truck and this guy developed this,

55
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:04,210
this way of making brisket
that's fucking insane.

56
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:07,150
And he does it totally old school.
He gets up in the middle of the night,

57
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:12,070
throws wood in the fire, he knows the
right amount of shit to spray on the meat.

58
00:03:12,071 --> 00:03:12,310
You're like,

59
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:15,340
it's all just simple salt and pepper
and like a little vinegar or something,

60
00:03:15,341 --> 00:03:17,140
I don't know,
water or whatever the fuck is using,

61
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:20,350
but apparently it's unbelievable.
But let's be realistic folks.

62
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,750
You're not that fucking guy.
Okay.

63
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,560
And if you get one of these green mountain
grills, you can make like some ribs.

64
00:03:26,561 --> 00:03:27,580
You could actually do this.

65
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:30,590
Can I tell you what my grill is like now?
I have a thermos grail.

66
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:36,080
It's five years old from
target 100 buckets from therm,
the thermos company. And,

67
00:03:36,081 --> 00:03:36,350
uh,

68
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:41,350
I had some on steak and the insight paint
that black paint has started to come.

69
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:46,700
Oh, at the time. Yeah. It started, it
has started to come onto my meat now.

70
00:03:46,701 --> 00:03:51,130
So I think it's, uh, it's probably
very toxic. What I'm eating now. Fun.

71
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,940
I just kind of,
you scratch it off,

72
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,980
but it's so gross because
every team you're me. Yeah.
And I think it's like not,

73
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:00,360
it's this kind of paint that
it's used to like, you know,

74
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:03,290
in four inside of grills.
So it's probably like heavy duty

75
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,210
baking, paint banking. Yeah. Yeah.

76
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:09,850
It's probably designed by the
government to keep idiots in check. Yes.

77
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:12,790
I might have to figure out a way to
get that paint chip, those nettle,

78
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,290
nettle fibers getting into your head.

79
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,430
That's the government man that I've never
even heard of that happening before.

80
00:04:18,431 --> 00:04:21,490
That sounds terrible. That should
not happen. Right know, have, look,

81
00:04:21,491 --> 00:04:24,170
if you're on a budget, man, just get
yourself one of those kettle grill.

82
00:04:24,171 --> 00:04:25,510
So it was like Weber Kettle Grill.

83
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:29,620
Those are fucking bad ass and they're
not that expensive, relatively speaking.

84
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,940
That's a great, yeah. I'm one of those.

85
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:34,720
I have a Kamado which is very similar to
the egg. It's just a little bit bigger,

86
00:04:34,721 --> 00:04:38,140
a little prettier. They make them
like artistic. But uh, I like,

87
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,630
I like cooking steaks on that
too. But there's this, this,

88
00:04:40,631 --> 00:04:43,480
the beautiful thing about one of these a
pellet grills is that you can't fuck it

89
00:04:43,481 --> 00:04:45,790
up. It tells you what
temperature it is. 500 degrees,

90
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:49,300
you know exactly how long to
cook it at 500 degrees. It's a,

91
00:04:49,301 --> 00:04:51,630
it's pretty bad ass and you can, like I
said, he can do all kinds of shit within.

92
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,421
They're very nice.

93
00:04:52,421 --> 00:04:56,770
Folks were also brought to you by Ting
Tang is a mobile company that we've been

94
00:04:56,771 --> 00:04:58,790
uh,
representing on this podcast for a while.

95
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:01,660
Apparently there was some apprehension
about going with us. Brian,

96
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,000
a lot of people didn't believe
in the Joe Rogan experience.

97
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,340
I thought that maybe were a tad fringe,

98
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:10,850
maybe were half baked as it were.
Uh,

99
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:14,410
not that tech. Well, we were
slightly technically oriented.

100
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,730
You're far more technically oriented
oriented than I am. But, uh,

101
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:23,320
the reality is, um, it's
a, it's a great fit for us.

102
00:05:23,321 --> 00:05:24,160
This tank company,

103
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:29,000
the reason being that it's
a company that's not trying
to rip anybody off there,

104
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:32,320
they're trying to make a
respectable profit, but they're not,

105
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:37,350
they're not offering you all the like
sneaky shit that exists and regular cell

106
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:40,960
phone contracts, like first of
all, the contract itself, you know,

107
00:05:40,961 --> 00:05:42,280
you can't just get a phone,

108
00:05:42,281 --> 00:05:45,070
you have to get a contract with
someone to get that phone activated.

109
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,200
And in most cases with them means is
if you want to cancel your service,

110
00:05:50,201 --> 00:05:53,410
you have to pay, you know,
a, what they do is a,

111
00:05:53,411 --> 00:05:56,560
apparently they sort of
move the numbers around.

112
00:05:56,561 --> 00:06:00,230
When you buy a phone's like say if you
want to buy like an iPhone and if you go

113
00:06:00,231 --> 00:06:03,970
to any big name, store,
whatever, you know, big name,
cell phone company and the,

114
00:06:03,971 --> 00:06:06,890
and the name though,
when you're paying x amount of money,

115
00:06:06,891 --> 00:06:08,660
it's normally more than that.

116
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,920
So they take that money away from the
price to sort of entice you into it.

117
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:14,330
But the deal is if you,

118
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:18,290
if you try to like take that phone and
then just cancel in a month and take your,

119
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,480
you know, x amount of dollars
savings, they'll, they'll,

120
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,240
they would lose a lot of money that way.

121
00:06:23,241 --> 00:06:26,610
So the way they do it as they make
you pay that back, if you cancel ting,

122
00:06:26,611 --> 00:06:28,840
doesn't fuck with that Tang.
Makes it very simple. They,

123
00:06:28,841 --> 00:06:33,500
they offer you the best android phones.
You can get really cool ones. Like A,

124
00:06:33,501 --> 00:06:35,570
I have the Samsung Galaxy s three,

125
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:39,440
and that's the one that's
coming to Brian to um, and a,

126
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:43,610
if you go to a brogan.ting.com fuck,
I think that's it.

127
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:48,340
Yeah. rogan.ting.com they'll
give you 50 bucks off of, uh,

128
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:50,660
any android phone when you start up.

129
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,930
They have a mobile hotspot,
four g mobile hotspot for 125 bucks.

130
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,730
Yeah. Dude, it's a fucking
great company, man. No,

131
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,900
no joke there on the sprint backbone.

132
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:02,880
So you don't have to worry about
any wonky fucking backwoods service.

133
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:07,290
It's an actual, real top
flight, cellular backbone.

134
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:09,930
And, um, because of that, they can,

135
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:14,960
they can offer you what a big name
company can offer you as well as offer you

136
00:07:15,331 --> 00:07:19,830
what this ethical, small company
is, is trying to provide,

137
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:22,250
look, they have the cell phone tower
things that you put in your house.

138
00:07:22,251 --> 00:07:24,890
So if you have bad service in your house,
it broadcast Internet.

139
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:28,000
Yeah. Juices it up. It says
something. What does it do? Let's,

140
00:07:28,001 --> 00:07:30,750
let's read what it does.
So we don't give out into information

141
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,110
connects to the Internet and it
broadcasts a four g signal in your house.

142
00:07:35,111 --> 00:07:39,100
So if you have like a live in a place
that has a sketchy neighborhood,

143
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:43,000
but you have great internet, you can
make your own Forgy tower pretty much in.

144
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:45,040
Really? Yeah. That's
incredible. That is good.

145
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:48,550
And it's using sprint's network and
because it's connected to your Internet,

146
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:51,040
I think that,
I think that's even better.

147
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:54,670
Sweet. Jesus. No, no. Does it get any
better than this? Ladies and gentlemen,

yourself some money. And, uh,

149
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:03,490

a lot of customers from this campaign

Anything we say is what we believe.

154
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,290

if I find out I'm wrong,

155
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:21,080
I'm going to fucking tell you
right away and apologize. Um,

156
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:24,040
everyone needs a whole phone.
Everyone needs a hoe phone. If a,

157
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:27,550
especially gay dudes, let's be honest,
you're not going to keep it together.

158
00:08:27,551 --> 00:08:32,200
You're all guys. You're going to
get wacky. It's beautiful thing.

159
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,630
Celebrate it. Get yourself a tig
or if you're really gangster,

160
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,720
get when a virgin mobile fucking flip
phones and pretend to use that shift for

161
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:41,740
anything other than Dick.

162
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:45,520
Anybody sees you enter in their
number into that knows all this.

163
00:08:45,521 --> 00:08:49,630
One of the fucker doesn't care about me.
This motherfucker's not hear from me.

164
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:55,170
rogan.ting.com excellent company.
They have a couple of things going him.

165
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:57,360
That's great. Besides the fact
that you don't have contracts.

166
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,750
One of them is that if you,
they have certain tiers like you know,

167
00:09:00,751 --> 00:09:05,520
use x amount of minutes. I don't
know the exact system they have but,

168
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,600
or the plans that they have.

169
00:09:06,601 --> 00:09:11,601
But what I do know is if you use
like what a lower plan would be,

170
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:16,080
they credit you on your next bill.
So no one's trying to rip you off.

171
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,730
They're trying to offer you the best
cell phone service available in a way

172
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:25,240
that's very ethical in a way that I
think is very generous and it makes it,

173
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,990
it makes you feel better about what
you're dealing with because you know what

174
00:09:27,991 --> 00:09:31,230
else is out there, you know, you know,
if you can deal with a company like this,

175
00:09:31,231 --> 00:09:34,290
like I would, I would, I like
to vote with my money, you know?

176
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:36,060
And when there's a company
like this that comes around,

177
00:09:36,061 --> 00:09:38,010
it's doing something cool like this.
I like to support it.

178
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:41,910
And so that's why they're a,
that's why they're a part of the podcast.

179
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:45,150
We're also brought to you by [inaudible]
dot com and if you ever been on it

180
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:47,850
before, we got a whole
bunch of new shit, man.

181
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:53,060
Like fucking Buffalo Jerky is this
Tonka Buffalo Jerky that's made with

182
00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:57,510
cranberries. We got killer bee honey.
Why do we have killer bee honey?

183
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,910
Because it's gangster as fuck.

184
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:04,950
That's why it's gangster as fuck to have
killer bee honey. Man. I don't even,

185
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,260
I tried it the other day. It tastes
like honey. I don't give a fuck.

186
00:10:07,261 --> 00:10:11,480
I felt special. You don't have
grocery stores in my tea. Gotcha.

187
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:14,950
She had grocery stores will have like
problem with like lettuce, like Eh,

188
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,220
you know,
making people sick or something like that.

189
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,060
That seems like the least
dangerous thing ever.

190
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:22,190
But you're having killer bee
honey. Yeah, it's gangster.

191
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:26,400
That seems like you need that bigger
insurance costs are sexy. Dude. Seem sexy.

192
00:10:26,401 --> 00:10:27,750
You want to rub that shit on your Dick.

193
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,070
I bet your deck would
just get hard and silly.

194
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:33,690
That killer events almost venomous.
It's probably delicious.

195
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:37,500
It's very good for you. Official
jellies are the new things that we have.

196
00:10:37,501 --> 00:10:39,570
We have those for kids. Um, you know,

197
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:44,040
give kids a good dose of
Omega Threes v Fatty Acids,

198
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:47,720
which are very important for brain
function development. And uh,

199
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,910
a lot of people don't get them in their
diet so they make them in almost like a

200
00:10:50,911 --> 00:10:54,120
candy. It's pretty cool. I just
started feeding it to my kids.

201
00:10:54,121 --> 00:10:55,890
Hopefully it's not a science project.

202
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:00,870
My sister's daughter can't read my
fucking mind cause no kids from the past,

203
00:11:00,871 --> 00:11:02,130
I forgot like fish oil pills.

204
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:04,860
What if the kid started their brains
start developing and control and it's the

205
00:11:04,861 --> 00:11:07,320
next stage of evolution or not.

206
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:12,420
We also sell battle ropes and kettle
bells. We sell a fitness equipment.

207
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:16,080
That type of the type of shit that we
sale sell rather is all type of shit that

208
00:11:16,081 --> 00:11:20,340
I would use. We also have, um, DVDs.
Now for a while people were saying like,

209
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:23,040
what's the best workout you can do online?
Well,

210
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:26,220
there's one that I always talked up,
so we just decided to start selling it.

211
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,850
It's called the extreme
kettle bell cardio,

212
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:32,730
a DVD and um,
it's,

213
00:11:32,731 --> 00:11:36,930
this guy is a fucking animal.
My God's Keith Webber.

214
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:42,180
Fuck what a what a what a workout. This
is, it's so brutal. I do this shit.

215
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,510
We get to that. I do this, uh,

216
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:48,450
this thing with just 35 pounds
and you feel like such a,

217
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:52,140
it's amazing how tired you
can get with just 35 pounds.

218
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,580
You'd be amazed at,
like,

219
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:58,570
everybody thinks that it's like hard
to go to the gym and lift some weights.

220
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:02,320
Lifting weights is easy.
It's really easy.

221
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,000
You know what's really hard?

222
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:09,040
Lifting something that's not that heavy
all lot of times and doing it with your

223
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:13,030
whole body over and over and over
and over and over again. It's you,

224
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,200
you're breaking.

225
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:18,060
Everything just breaks down and it's
pretty safe because of the fact it's

226
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,230
unbelievable workout in
a short amount of time.

227
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:24,410
But you're not doing the type of things
that you do when you blow out discs and

228
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:25,570
it really fuck yourself up,

229
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,870
which is what a lot of people do when
they start lifting heavy weights.

230
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,730
Like everybody wants to be like super big.

231
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,870
And the way to get super big is you gotta
do like dead lifts and squats and all

232
00:12:34,871 --> 00:12:38,170
that shit with heavyweights so
that your body goes, oh Jesus,

233
00:12:38,171 --> 00:12:40,690
we got to get bigger.
Well, with kettle bells,

234
00:12:40,691 --> 00:12:42,850
the beautiful thing is
you just get stronger.

235
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:48,030
It just makes your body acclimated to
doing a lot of like physical work that

236
00:12:48,431 --> 00:12:52,480
will really manifest itself in real life
situations because you're using your

237
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:56,470
body all is one unit two, it'll help
you with picking up stuff. It'll,

238
00:12:56,471 --> 00:13:00,700
it'll help you, you know, if you do any
sort of sport it'll help you. But I'm a,

239
00:13:00,701 --> 00:13:04,990
I'm a huge, huge fan of kettle bells
both in, um, there's a, you know,

240
00:13:04,991 --> 00:13:08,410
a bunch of schools of thought. Steve
Maxwell believes in like lower weight,

241
00:13:08,411 --> 00:13:11,980
higher repetition, you know,
extreme, uh, you know, clean form.

242
00:13:11,981 --> 00:13:14,710
And he's one of the masters of it as,
as Mike Mahler,

243
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:17,920
who's more of like a really heavyweight,
shorter,

244
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,630
smaller reps guy and he's fucking, that
guy's yoked as fuck. And he's a Vegan too,

245
00:13:22,631 --> 00:13:26,590
which is incredible. Um,
I'm rambling. It's official.

246
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,400
Listen folks, go to [inaudible] dot com
get yourself some hemp protein powder.

247
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:32,410
You will not test positive.
Don't worry.

248
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:35,740
People need to have that explained
to them over and over again.

249
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:38,320
Hemp protein powder is one of the best,

250
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:42,910
most efficient protein powder for
your body to process. Um, but it's,

251
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:47,530
there's no THC in it so you can eat it
and it does not come up in your system.

252
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:52,120
Whereas like poppy seeds will come up
as morphine or heroin. This does not,

253
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:56,320
you don't have to worry about that there.
Hemp is completely non psychoactive,

254
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:01,420
but unfortunately we live in retarded
times and we cannot grow this plant in

255
00:14:01,421 --> 00:14:04,960
America. We have to actually, it's
legal to have, you can even buy it.

256
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:07,090
You could bring it over here. You can
import it. Nobody has a problem with that,

257
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:10,600
but you cannot grow it. How
much sense does that make? Zero.

258
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:15,370
So they grow it in Canada. So, uh, they
grown in Canada and we have to buy it.

259
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,360
We can't even employ American farmers
on it. We wanted to start a farm.

260
00:14:19,361 --> 00:14:23,320
We were like, it would be
beautiful because we know
that Vermont has a legal hemp

261
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:26,790
manufacturing and now I believe
because of what happened,

262
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:31,450
the the law that got passed and
cal in Colorado and Washington,

263
00:14:31,451 --> 00:14:33,010
I think at least in one of those states,

264
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:35,380
you're supposed to be
allowed to grow hemp now too,

265
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:39,190
but the government will arrest you.
That's the bottom line on it. It's, it's,

266
00:14:39,191 --> 00:14:40,720
it's all based on ignorance.

267
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:45,340
It's a completely non
psychoactive version of uh, the,

268
00:14:45,341 --> 00:14:47,710
the cat,
the cannabis plant.

269
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,920
It's not the same thing as marijuana
and it's illegal all because of it as a

270
00:14:53,361 --> 00:14:56,340
commodity and it's, it
stay there, hold it down,

271
00:14:56,341 --> 00:15:01,341
and they keep it from farmers because
it could take away a lot of different

272
00:15:01,881 --> 00:15:04,190
things.
Take them out of the market.

273
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:08,150
A lot of different things that
we consider standard, like ropes,

274
00:15:08,151 --> 00:15:12,290
nylon ropes will actually, hemp is a
better fucking rope. You know, clothes,

275
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:14,960
cold clothes are made out of cotton.
Actually, if they were made it a hamp,

276
00:15:14,961 --> 00:15:18,760
they'd be better. They're
more durable. Paper. It's, it
makes way better paper. It,

277
00:15:18,761 --> 00:15:23,150
it makes so many things better and it's
illegal. And it doesn't get you high.

278
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:26,570
It's the whole thing is fucking crazy.

279
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:31,460
If it looked completely different than
pot and had a completely different name

280
00:15:31,461 --> 00:15:34,100
and was not related, but it was
going through the same circumstances,

281
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,310
people would be up in
arms as they should be.

282
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:42,430
Farmers should be up in arms about this
because it's an incredibly good plant to

283
00:15:44,301 --> 00:15:48,710
have on your soil. You can replenish
your crops in a short amount of time.

284
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:52,970
It grows very fast. It's very
healthy. You don't need pesticides.

285
00:15:52,971 --> 00:15:57,080
It's an incredibly strong plant. It's
good for so many different fucking things,

286
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:00,260
and if you try to grow it,
they'll put you in a cage.

287
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:03,860
They will take all your money.
They will separate you from your family.

288
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,280
They will lock you in a cage if
you try to grow this awesome plant.

289
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,250
So that's why hemp protein
powder cost so much, folks.

290
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:13,370
It's fucking stupid and
it's fucking ridiculous.

291
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:18,290
In 2012 wake up, you
freaks. Wake the fuck up.

292
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:22,010
Go get yourself some Alpha brain
and think this shit through.

293
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:23,450
Go get yourself a blender.

294
00:16:23,451 --> 00:16:26,840
We can no longer offer the BLENDTEC
blenders with a free hemp force.

295
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:31,340
They have ra, they have Lou rules as to
how you sell shit because it doesn't,

296
00:16:31,341 --> 00:16:33,230
it just makes it too desirable.

297
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:37,560
Maybe you should have a thing like every
time you sell over $300 you get a free

298
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,513
him force.

299
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:42,850
Can't do it. Oh like anything
from this from that's a good idea.

300
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:45,460
Like anything from the whole store.
Yeah, we'll put that into play.

301
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,460
We'll speak to Aubrey about that.
Get that shit in motion. All right.

302
00:16:48,461 --> 00:16:52,420
This fucking commercials really long and
Tim Ferriss is here so let's get this

303
00:16:52,421 --> 00:16:53,980
party started.
You dirty anything to add?

304
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,050
Anything promote isn't
going on and he shows,

305
00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:00,960
oh, I'll be with Doug Benson Wednesday
and San Diego at the American Comedy Co.

306
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,950
Jesus Christ son, comedy co.com. It's
a good club down there too. Very,

307
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:08,160
very perfect little comedy club and
we'll have a desk squad show there.

308
00:17:08,161 --> 00:17:13,020
The 12 1212 also and I think there's a,
the other place is really good too.

309
00:17:13,021 --> 00:17:16,400
That Matt House. Yeah, that place is
good. I want you to go, there you go.

310
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:20,640
Make a comeback. Bitches. All right
folks. That's it. It's fucking,

311
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:23,610
let's get a girl hit that. Hit
that button. Let's talk. Yeah.

312
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:24,453
Crazy.

313
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,810
The Joe Rogan experience.

314
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:31,360
Try it my day.
Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.

315
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,713
Boom.

316
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,820
Bitches back with new
knowledge and information.

317
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:41,930
Tim Ferriss joins the podcast. My brother,
thank you for coming back, man. Oh,

318
00:17:41,931 --> 00:17:44,930
it's great to be back. I've been looking
forward to this one for months. Dude.

319
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:46,250
I've been looking forward
to how you want to.

320
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:50,160
I'm a glad we were able to work this out
time wise. You're very busy character.

321
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:55,030
You too. Do you have a four day
marriage? Is that out yet? You know,

322
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:58,860
people have asked for the floor
for our marriage and I'm like,

323
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,760
you know, that'd be easy to
write given the rate of divorce.

324
00:18:02,761 --> 00:18:03,571
It's like I can find it.

325
00:18:03,571 --> 00:18:07,110
I can do those interviews for our
Presidency Ninja until I figure it out.

326
00:18:07,111 --> 00:18:11,940
It's not going to read a book for
our CEO. Yeah. A lot of those too.

327
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:16,140
There's a lot of those too.
Yeah. Um, your, uh, your new
book is, what is it called?

328
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:20,010
The four hour commercial. That's
me, man. I'm the master. That shit.

329
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,400
The four hour chef,
four hour chef.

330
00:18:23,401 --> 00:18:27,210
Simple path to cooking like a pro
learning anything in living the good life.

331
00:18:27,211 --> 00:18:30,300
It's a very narrow scope that's
not announced scope at all.

332
00:18:30,301 --> 00:18:33,630
How dare you confusing me. I'm not
as smart as you settle down. Well,

333
00:18:33,631 --> 00:18:37,200
this is the second. This is probably the
first time I've actually had some TAC,

334
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:40,950
my system since the last podcast. Well
that's ridiculous. What a coincidence.

335
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:45,450
Attribute that to Tim Ferriss is pure
knowing that the government is listening

336
00:18:45,451 --> 00:18:49,120
and all. So we always like to
hydrogen like the government.

337
00:18:49,121 --> 00:18:52,020
Know you guys are talking about trying
to pretend like the government is spying

338
00:18:52,021 --> 00:18:55,320
on us. But meanwhile we broadcast
his shit on our Internet show.

339
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:57,060
That's how you know you're
a stoner. You're like, dude,

340
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:59,910
what if the governments listen
to his podcast right now? Dude,

341
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:03,480
thousands of people who listen to
this fucking thing right now. Oh yeah.

342
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:07,380
Fuck the government. Why are
they listening? Why do they care?

343
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,690
Um, for our government, is that
possible? Maybe that we form government.

344
00:19:12,691 --> 00:19:16,710
We might be past that point. You could
have a four hour countdown clock.

345
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:20,190
Do you think that's happening? Well,
you worried? Yeah, I'm worried.

346
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:23,730
Are you worried about, uh, what's going
on in Israel and the Gaza Strip on board?

347
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,590
Not only about that but also honestly,

348
00:19:25,591 --> 00:19:29,910
but just the financial integrity this
entire country. Yeah. And it seems fake.

349
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,450
All right. I know exactly. And you
know, the financial integrity. So yeah,

350
00:19:33,451 --> 00:19:34,111
there's a really,

351
00:19:34,111 --> 00:19:37,230
there's a really good book called the
biography of a dollar which talks about

352
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:40,650
just the development of the currency
of the US dollar and where it is today.

353
00:19:40,651 --> 00:19:45,090
And the conclusion of all of those books
is basically like buy shotguns by food.

354
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:49,980
We'll get something in a
different currency. And um,
what was kind of wild is,

355
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:51,830
so what I was looking at the uh,

356
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:55,500
doing research for the four hour chef and
we've got into this the wild stuff and

357
00:19:55,501 --> 00:19:56,201
we can talk about that,

358
00:19:56,201 --> 00:19:59,460
but like the foraging and tufting
and all these things that never done.

359
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,030
And I went a little bit off the rails and
started meeting all these survivalists

360
00:20:03,031 --> 00:20:04,020
and preppers and whatnot.

361
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:07,650
And so I ended up writing like 150
pages that to cut because I just went

362
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:12,120
ballistic in more ways than one just
to researching all this shit. But, uh,

363
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,150
and I had a number of close
friends in San Francisco, New York,

364
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:18,930
thought I was fucking nuts. And then
hurricane sandy comes along. Whoa.

365
00:20:18,931 --> 00:20:22,380
So they thought that you were taking this
way too far and you had lost your mind

366
00:20:22,381 --> 00:20:26,970
and you were proposing and probable
scenarios and then hurricane sandy and now

367
00:20:26,971 --> 00:20:29,880
everybody has to think it's
amazing how fragile our,

368
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:34,380
our life is here on this
planet. We essentially, you
know, live without a roof.

369
00:20:34,381 --> 00:20:37,050
Most of the time the world is
a convertible. Yeah. You know,

370
00:20:37,051 --> 00:20:41,160
and above us is all this shit
is flying around. There's,

371
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:46,190
there's like thousands of times every day
a piece of rock from outer space comes

372
00:20:46,531 --> 00:20:48,070
into the atmosphere and burns up.

373
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:52,000
Yeah. Like people need to wrap
their heads around that. All right.

374
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,030
This is crazy.
This does not have to,

375
00:20:55,031 --> 00:20:58,600
just because this has been here as a
city for a hundred years doesn't mean it

376
00:20:58,601 --> 00:20:59,740
has to stay like this.
Yeah.

377
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:01,710
Well, no, exactly. And um,

378
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:06,240
so Nassim Taleb who wrote the
Black Swan fooled by randomness,

379
00:21:06,241 --> 00:21:07,680
he's a really good example,
which is, you know,

380
00:21:07,681 --> 00:21:10,680
the Turkey thinks that things
are going great all the,

381
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:12,540
all the way up until thanksgiving,
you know,

382
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:16,710
like just the fact that he's had 364
days of live in pretty doesn't mean three

383
00:21:16,711 --> 00:21:18,500
65 is going to be very brilliant.

384
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:20,310
I always use if my,

385
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:24,930
my analogy is the ant hill analogy that
there could be an ant hill that exists

386
00:21:24,931 --> 00:21:28,680
in a field and it's a big ant hill and
these ants have been working in this ant

387
00:21:28,681 --> 00:21:32,160
hill for God knows how long and they only
live for like a short amount of time.

388
00:21:32,161 --> 00:21:35,040
So it's been there long
before they were ever born.

389
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:38,550
This ant hills existed in its
many fucking complicated caverns.

390
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:42,870
And then one day this little kid comes
along and stops the fucking shit out of

391
00:21:42,871 --> 00:21:46,590
that hill and no one saw it coming.
It never happened before.

392
00:21:46,591 --> 00:21:49,560
So they never even considered it.
They just fucking go about their day.

393
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:52,980
And this little kid comes along and
stomped the shit out of that anthill.

394
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,710
And that's exactly what
happened with Hurricane Katrina.

395
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,900
That's exactly what happened with Sandy.

396
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,500
That's what could happen with
Yellowstone Jeliboo. Yeah.

397
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:05,280
Or any sort of an earthquake. I mean,
I have a friend who has a house.

398
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:10,080
He has a vacation house on the
beach in Malibu. It is so bad ass.

399
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,370
You sit there and be like, you're
on the ocean. And it's like,

400
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:17,970
it's such a humbling experience to
have an, it's like something like very,

401
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,380
it just connects you.

402
00:22:19,381 --> 00:22:22,500
It's some weird way to nature
when you're staring at that water.

403
00:22:22,501 --> 00:22:25,000
I think that's why beach
communities are so chill. You know,

404
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,340
beach communities are like,

405
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:30,840
every day you're confronted with this
reality that you ain't shit. Okay.

406
00:22:30,841 --> 00:22:32,130
You stop and look out there,
do it.

407
00:22:32,131 --> 00:22:36,060
As far as you can see is
water and you die out there.

408
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:37,290
You can't make it.

409
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,740
And if for some reason it just
switches back and forth a little,

410
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:45,330
it's going to wipe out everything for
a hundred miles in like it's nothing.

411
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:49,530
Okay. So settle the fuck down and
stop taking yourself so seriously.

412
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:52,800
Like that's the feeling that you
get when you're right next to water.

413
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,790
I think that's important for people.
I think

414
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:59,970
it is. I think it's also the, the sort of
meditative aspect of the, of the waves.

415
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:00,923
I think

416
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,140
I have,
it gives you a feeling,

417
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:06,550
it gives you like a peaceful feeling
when you're like sitting around and like,

418
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,540
you're in Hawaii and you look
at it that water, you know,

419
00:23:08,541 --> 00:23:12,020
you're on top of a volcano,
you know the shit is temporary as fuck,

420
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:15,170
but you're like, I didn't. Yeah, right now
it's beautiful right now. It's amazing,

421
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,073
you know,

422
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:19,510
or to, you know, I grew up on long
island way out at the end and apart.

423
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:22,280
What does that like mes at Montauk.
So I grew up as a townie,

424
00:23:22,281 --> 00:23:25,160
like a rat rat tail
wearing townie Hamptons.

425
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:31,010
And you start thinking
about, let's just say, uh,

426
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,720
you know, climate change.
And then you look at the,

427
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:37,770
the wealth concentration in the first
10 to 20 miles of every coastline.

428
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:41,870
It's like 80% of the world's wealth
would just be wiped out if there's a

429
00:23:41,871 --> 00:23:46,050
dramatic temperature change.
And with Hurricane Sandy,
what's, what's not amused,

430
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:49,730
it's depressingly amusing to me is when
people are like, oh, that's a one in 100,

431
00:23:49,731 --> 00:23:54,140
one in 1,000,001. And if you look at,
uh, there was a piece in nature magazine,

432
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,040
this is just in the last,

433
00:23:55,041 --> 00:23:58,880
I think few months where they said if
climate change continues as predicted,

434
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,690
100 year storms will have
to happen every three years.

435
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,150
I took a,
uh,

436
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:09,950
a training course in San Francisco
that was done by the police department,

437
00:24:09,951 --> 00:24:10,784
the fire department,

438
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:15,230
which was the northern California
emergency response training nerd.

439
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:20,210
And in the first class, this
is the police. This isn't
some Wacko like paranoid,

440
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:25,280
uh, dooms doomsday a predictor. He
said, all right, let's do an exercise.

441
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:27,590
How many people are there
in San Francisco? Something
like, wow, I don't know,

442
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:31,370
whatever, 800,000. Right,
okay. If everyone's commuting
in like a couple of million,

443
00:24:31,371 --> 00:24:32,990
whatever it might be.
Okay.

444
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:35,540
How many fire engines do you
think there are in San Francisco?

445
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:37,790
And everyone's like 102
hundred 50 whatever it was.

446
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:40,160
It was something like 19 and he said,

447
00:24:40,161 --> 00:24:44,030
what that means is if you look at like
the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989 it

448
00:24:44,031 --> 00:24:47,200
could be seven to 10 days
before anybody gets to, like,

449
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:52,230
you cannot rely on the existing
structure and that kind of blew my mind.

450
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:56,330
I was like, even though it's amazing, 10
days, it's amazing. Get it done that fast.

451
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:59,600
I after Sandy, I'm like,
well, there's look,

452
00:24:59,601 --> 00:25:03,710
they don't have a backup plan for
something massive. You know what?

453
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:07,070
They have coffins. Yeah, right.
They have those plastic coffins.

454
00:25:07,071 --> 00:25:09,170
They save up in case a
fucking asteroid hits us.

455
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:12,560
They don't have like some
crazy plan to feed everybody.

456
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:16,160
They have a plan to go overseas
and Jack people and take their oil.

457
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:19,430
No plan to take care of the people in
case if there's some sort of an earthquake

458
00:25:19,431 --> 00:25:21,020
or something. Oh yeah, no, there's,

459
00:25:21,021 --> 00:25:23,180
there's no possible response
that would cover it.

460
00:25:23,181 --> 00:25:25,790
And so would you know what I figured out
is I started doing the math and I was

461
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:29,300
like, well, I spend, because I've
broken myself like a thousand times,

462
00:25:29,301 --> 00:25:34,010
I spend 500 $600 a month
in health insurance and I
don't even have 20 gallons of

463
00:25:34,011 --> 00:25:38,570
water and food and a
shotgun and a few things,

464
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:42,770
which would cost what,
500,000 bucks total onetime cost.

465
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:46,260
I have a friend who has a solar powered
house. That's cool. That's cool.

466
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:48,050
That's gotta be the way to go.

467
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:51,550
Especially out here and just
even a cheap generator. Like, uh,

468
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:55,880
I had the power go out on my block in
San Francisco for 24 hours and I realized

469
00:25:55,940 --> 00:26:00,590
all my food is going bad. I had like
80 pounds of meat, no power supplies.

470
00:26:00,591 --> 00:26:02,960
So I got a,
I think it's a Honda.

471
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:06,770
I like to EU 2009 I
generator that's popular,

472
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:10,790
popular burning man and then a bunch of
extra gasoline and I would not buy it

473
00:26:10,791 --> 00:26:15,050
just for that. Well, I can
get a burning smell every,

474
00:26:15,051 --> 00:26:18,020
I can go to burning man with the rest
of San Francisco to see all my friends.

475
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:22,790
Why don't I smelled like petroleum?
Listen burning man. People relax.

476
00:26:22,791 --> 00:26:26,210
I'm just joking. I don't what you
getting angry at me? Fuck you dude.

477
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:29,810
Why is it aggro problem with burning man?
I don't really,

478
00:26:29,811 --> 00:26:31,340
I'm just completely joking.

479
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:35,180
Can you just say shit just to say shit
sometimes everybody's going to take

480
00:26:35,181 --> 00:26:38,390
everything so fucking seriously. Um, yeah,

481
00:26:38,391 --> 00:26:40,950
I think that generators
are an awesome idea. Yeah,

482
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,950
that's a good idea to have around.
It's far though.

483
00:26:42,951 --> 00:26:44,550
If live in an apartment
with the fuck do you do,

484
00:26:44,551 --> 00:26:47,880
then you could actually pull it off and
the owners and I thought I figured this

485
00:26:47,881 --> 00:26:49,030
out.
Open the window or something.

486
00:26:49,031 --> 00:26:52,200
And then you just have to have an exhaust
exhaust pipe going out the window.

487
00:26:52,201 --> 00:26:55,710
So you get some coil up thing. In
that case. How long does it stay on?

488
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,960
It depends on the gasoline.
You have a,

489
00:26:57,961 --> 00:27:02,670
I mean I have maybe 10 gallons of
gasoline and this, this generator. What's,

490
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:07,700
what's great about it is it looks like
an old school like desktops server or

491
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:11,670
really? Yeah, it's tiny. It looks like one
of those towers. It's not heavy at all.

492
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:15,360
It probably weighs 30 pounds.
And how does the gas tank connect to it?

493
00:27:15,361 --> 00:27:16,051
What does it look like?

494
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:19,590
Cause it like you pour the gasoline right
right into the generator itself. Yeah.

495
00:27:19,591 --> 00:27:23,270
It's really well done. How old? How many
gowns? I don't know. Off Hand. Yeah,

496
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:23,971
I found I had it.

497
00:27:23,971 --> 00:27:26,730
So how long does it stay with like
one fill up and you turn it on?

498
00:27:26,731 --> 00:27:31,110
How long does it stay on? I honestly am
not sure I have everything ready to go,

499
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:34,770
but I couldn't fit more than a 10
gallons of gasoline in my apartment.

500
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,860
Isn't it fucked up.
Thinking about that.

501
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:40,430
Like thinking about alternative
ways to keep the power on.

502
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:42,020
That's fucking terrifying.
Yeah.

503
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:47,120
Everyone should at least get a Red Cross
endorsed hand wind up powered radio,

504
00:27:50,281 --> 00:27:54,190
which also doubles as a charger. You can
get these for like 40 bucks on Amazon.

505
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,640
Power's out. Won't the radio
be out too? Well it can. Uh,

506
00:27:57,641 --> 00:27:59,670
you can actually use
different frequencies.

507
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:03,090
So I mean like the ham
radio is crazy as it seems,

508
00:28:03,091 --> 00:28:06,120
is actually a pretty good to have
a pretty good skill to pick up.

509
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:08,520
Like that's what the fire
department police department,

510
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:13,110
they're like all those wines are the catch
patos right. It could be one of them.

511
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:17,310
Or Dungeons and dragons players
again,

512
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:22,170
which I was not slamming Ralph.
That's what you are gray alf has a grail.

513
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:26,700
Wow. Yeah. Um, you had 80
pounds of meat in your house.

514
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:32,300
I'll have more now. I have about 120
pounds. Three charters. Are you eating?

515
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,840
Are you eating homeless? Cleaning up
the streets, gentrify your neighborhood.

516
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:42,030
Try it. And so we have a, we have a
mutual friend now. Steve Rinella. Yeah.

517
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:46,020
And uh, I, so just to give some
context. So growing up on long island,

518
00:28:46,021 --> 00:28:49,210
Steve Rinella,
for folks who don't know a meat mediator,

519
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:53,180
he's an author actually as well.
It's got a book called [inaudible],

520
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:56,180
which is fantastic. Brilliant. Right?
It's a very good, brighter man. Yeah,

521
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:58,680
I'm really good. Very
bright guy. So I met,

522
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:03,740
I met Steve when I was investigating how
to reconnect with ingredients as part

523
00:29:04,681 --> 00:29:05,514
of this book.

524
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:10,410
And I think above and beyond that how
to correct like manual illiteracy,

525
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:10,801
right?

526
00:29:10,801 --> 00:29:13,080
So one of the things that really started
to bother me in the last few years is I

527
00:29:13,081 --> 00:29:15,090
looked at like what my dad could do,
my granddad could do,

528
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:20,250
I can't fix half the things on my car.
I can't do basic like woodwork.

529
00:29:20,251 --> 00:29:21,150
I can't do any of that shit.

530
00:29:21,151 --> 00:29:25,170
And I realized it was really causing
me a lot of anxiety not to build things

531
00:29:25,171 --> 00:29:28,890
with my hands. So food and foraging
and all this stuff became another way,

532
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:33,030
are one way to try to reclaim that.
And then Steve,

533
00:29:33,031 --> 00:29:37,970
I met through a bunch of different
random circumstances. Uh,

534
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:42,640
and what he countered was my image of a
hunter because growing up on long island,

535
00:29:42,641 --> 00:29:46,030
I had a lot of injured deer come across
my property from people who didn't know

536
00:29:46,031 --> 00:29:49,190
how to bow hunt beer cans
on the side of my, on this,

537
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,250
on like my side of my driveway.

538
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:55,210
And I just developed this real hatred.

539
00:29:55,211 --> 00:29:58,540
It was that strong for hunters and
just saw them as really responsible,

540
00:29:58,541 --> 00:30:02,280
wasteful kind of jerk offs. And then I
met Steve and uh, so I'll give a little,

541
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:05,830
you've probably heard this story, but what
blew me away about Steve is he'll say,

542
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,360
look,
there are a lot of better hunters than me,

543
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:09,180
although he's a really good hunter.
And I said,

544
00:30:09,181 --> 00:30:11,530
there are a lot of better cooks than me,
but I'm a decent cook.

545
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,210
But they're very few people
who can put them together.

546
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:16,810
And so he took for one of his
books, I guess was the, uh,

547
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:21,040
scavengers guide to Haute cuisine.
He,

548
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:24,350
he took this 1906, uh, scoffed a banquet.

549
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,820
SCAF he's like the grandfather of
French cuisine, three day banquet,

550
00:30:27,821 --> 00:30:32,030
like 40 different dishes with all this
weird shit, sting rays and you know,

551
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:34,240
quail stuffed with steer
Chin or who the fuck

552
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:37,160
no was he served people raccoon that
he found on the side of the road. Yeah.

553
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,053
And he would,
he didn't.

554
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,540
Particular three day banquet is,
he killed and forged everything.

555
00:30:41,541 --> 00:30:44,840
He got every ingredient then read and
then recreated the entire three day thing

556
00:30:44,841 --> 00:30:49,310
himself. Guy's a stud. Yeah. He's
an amazing dude. Oh, so for the,

557
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:52,550
he took me on my first ever hunt,
which was a white tail deer hunt.

558
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:57,320
And then most recently we went to
Alaska for about a week in the middle of

559
00:30:57,321 --> 00:30:58,430
nowhere to hunt Caribou.

560
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:01,140
So we are successful both times I was,
yeah,

561
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:05,090
that was so the whitetail deer was your
first experience the first time and

562
00:31:05,091 --> 00:31:05,880
where did you go there?

563
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:09,540
That was South Carolina
because in California you
have to fill out like a phone

564
00:31:09,541 --> 00:31:12,930
books worth of paperwork to get anything
done with hunting in South Carolina,

565
00:31:12,931 --> 00:31:15,270
you just buy the hunting license
online and you're done. Beautiful

566
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:17,160
people of South Carolina.
God bless you.

567
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,980
God bless you for fucking keeping the
bureaucracy and check. Um, so you,

568
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:27,720
your idea about wanting to hunt was
probably similar to what my idea was.

569
00:31:27,721 --> 00:31:31,860
It was like, I eat meat. I
have no connection to it.
I'm just buying it as to,

570
00:31:31,861 --> 00:31:33,800
I know this isn't healthy. It's a kid. I,

571
00:31:33,801 --> 00:31:37,110
I likened it to the
idea of being born rich.

572
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:40,770
It's like I didn't really understand
what it was like to earn it.

573
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:42,870
I didn't in any way,
shape or form.

574
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:47,340
And there's a lot of people that have a
lot of misunderstandings about hunting

575
00:31:47,341 --> 00:31:51,660
too. And I shared those when I was young.
I, I had a very ignorant appearance, uh,

576
00:31:51,661 --> 00:31:54,870
opinion on hunting too. I just
thought it was just people who like,

577
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:57,120
why would you kill an animal and you
can just go to the store and get it for

578
00:31:57,121 --> 00:31:59,610
free or you know,
buy it without to have to deal with that.

579
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:01,830
Like these people probably
want to kill animals. Like,

580
00:32:01,831 --> 00:32:03,240
well why don't you
leave the animals alone?

581
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:05,610
Then one day I was driving from a Gig,

582
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:10,760
I was in Boston or in New York rather
and I was an upper western Massachusetts

583
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:14,940
and I had to drive down and I got to go
like 30 fucking miles an hour cause he's

584
00:32:14,941 --> 00:32:18,240
dear just kept jumping in front of my car.
It was crazy.

585
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,640
I just kept seeing them over
and over and over again.

586
00:32:20,641 --> 00:32:23,670
They were all over the road. So I had
to drive really slow on the way home.

587
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:27,540
And it was a really common thing on this
one parkway where deer would get hit by

588
00:32:27,541 --> 00:32:28,374
cars.
Yeah.

589
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:31,830
I mean it was an infestation because
if you're looking at that much on the

590
00:32:31,831 --> 00:32:36,500
actual road, off to the right and off
to the left, there's fucking woods,

591
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:40,040
man. So who knows how many
God damn deer there. Those

592
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,290
deer, first of all, they're
going to get hit by cars.

593
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,620
They're going to starve because
they're going to run out of food.

594
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:49,610
And if they don't have hunters
managing that population,

595
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:52,850
there's only one other option.
And that option is predators.

596
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:54,200
So you have two options.

597
00:32:54,201 --> 00:32:59,201
You have something that can kill a fucking
deer with its face and you're going

598
00:32:59,451 --> 00:33:02,750
to have a good population of
those motherfuckers running
around and you're just

599
00:33:02,751 --> 00:33:06,590
going to trust that they're not going
to get you and your dog and your kids,

600
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:08,330
or you're going to,

601
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:11,100
you're going to manage that population
by shooting them and eating them. Yeah.

602
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:11,961
And it's a,

603
00:33:11,961 --> 00:33:16,520
it's a really fascinating
sort of a situation when
you really understand it for

604
00:33:16,521 --> 00:33:18,650
what it is.
Like it's wildlife management.

605
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:21,740
They have to do this because we
are at the top of the food chain.

606
00:33:21,741 --> 00:33:24,530
So we have to take responsibility
for that situation.

607
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:26,870
We have game and it's everywhere.

608
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:30,980
And if you don't eat it slowly but surely
that mountain lion population is going

609
00:33:30,981 --> 00:33:33,710
to start creeping up. That's just
how nature deals with shit or that,

610
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:36,800
or the human population's going to start
dropping because they become disease

611
00:33:36,801 --> 00:33:39,740
vectors for things like lymes disease.
And my brothers had lives these,

612
00:33:39,741 --> 00:33:43,620
my dad's had Lyme disease, upstate
New York. It's a real issue. Yeah,

613
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:48,200
I've heard quite a few people get it.
Yeah, it's too, there's only one issue.

614
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:51,650
There's a, there's a lot and
the fucking, it's great meat.

615
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,760
It's like really good for you.

616
00:33:52,761 --> 00:33:56,560
It's better for you than cows you buy in
a store that had been fed corn and uh,

617
00:33:56,561 --> 00:34:00,920
other, an unnatural things for cows.
It's way healthier for you. Um, my,

618
00:34:00,921 --> 00:34:05,270
my experience was a, my whole
life. I'd thought about it one way.

619
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:09,800
And then that one trip home I started
reconsidering like, this is fucking crazy.

620
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,260
And then I started looking at, but there
was no internet back then, you know,

621
00:34:12,261 --> 00:34:14,690
so I'd have to like read a book,
which is really annoying.

622
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:18,170
I've sat down there and I mean,
I don't mind reading a book now,

623
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:21,680
but when I was 20 or whenever the
fuck this was, you know, like why,

624
00:34:21,681 --> 00:34:25,160
why the fuck are so many deers?
And then as I looked into all this shit,

625
00:34:25,161 --> 00:34:27,050
I realized like, oh, they'd like, they,

626
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:30,230
there's arguments about managing them
and they're just like, get the game,

627
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:33,470
the fish and game and the hunters and
like everyone has to come to an agreement

628
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:36,800
of how many there are. And I go, what?
This is crazy. You've got these fucking,

629
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:39,020
they're like rats.
They're like giant rats.

630
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:43,460
Giant rats are run in front of your car
and commit suicide. It's fucking bananas.

631
00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:45,250
Um,
and they,

632
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:48,410
they taste delicious and then you could
shoot that with this and it's free.

633
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:52,310
You just have to pay for the license
and then hit him in the right spot.

634
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:56,150
They get this stressed than
meat's no good. Oh, is that true?

635
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,800
It can make it really a distasteful
if you get what's called a red cutter.

636
00:35:00,801 --> 00:35:04,970
So for instance, if you fuck it up and
you injure it and then you chase it,

637
00:35:04,971 --> 00:35:06,110
what you shouldn't do,
number one,

638
00:35:06,111 --> 00:35:10,510
if you get a good shot and then you
finally kill the thing, um, the, the, uh,

639
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:14,000
the access of adrenaline and whatnot
can really can, is that true?

640
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:19,160
Because my deer, I shot it and went down
and it was, uh, it was going to die,

641
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:23,050
but it was still alive in the next shot.
It again, I had to shoot it again. Yeah.

642
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:26,780
I think it depends a lot on the
duration of that sort of that stress.

643
00:35:26,781 --> 00:35:29,750
So what happens a lot, for
instance, of novice bow hunters,

644
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:30,500
and I'm not above a hundred.

645
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:34,490
Like they'll go in the woods for hours
with a bow and then instead of waiting

646
00:35:34,491 --> 00:35:36,860
for it to dial, chase it and we'll
run and run around, run around,

647
00:35:36,861 --> 00:35:38,100
run for like an hour.

648
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:43,060
Right. And that, and then drop. But that's
flooded with adrenaline. Yeah. I mean,

649
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:45,870
and again, I'm super nervous,
but based on what Steve told me,

650
00:35:45,871 --> 00:35:50,370
also like depending on what gender dear
you hit and if it's during mating season

651
00:35:50,371 --> 00:35:54,600
or not. So if you hit like a ruddy
buck is just pumped full of hormones,

652
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,670
naturally occurring hormones,
then I can end up being pretty.

653
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:03,700
And what if that's an aphrodisiac when
the deer is like super horny and you eat

654
00:36:03,701 --> 00:36:07,200
it's meat but seems kind of homosexual.

655
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:11,280
I gotta be honest with you. I don't
think there's anything wrong with that.

656
00:36:11,281 --> 00:36:12,114
But if it works,
it works.

657
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:15,540
I mean like what you're eating tiger
dicks or whatever the fuck it is.

658
00:36:15,541 --> 00:36:20,150
A Chinese people. Yeah, you're kind
of not tasty. It's very, I mean it's,

659
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:23,610
it's Inter Inter species, you
know, you're mixing species up,

660
00:36:23,611 --> 00:36:28,440
but it's also sort of homosexual anyway.
Yeah. I have the whole penis in China.

661
00:36:28,441 --> 00:36:29,880
Not Tasty.
I don't recommend it.

662
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:34,320
We serve that shit on fear factor and
served a water buffalo dicks. I saw that.

663
00:36:34,321 --> 00:36:38,100
I saw that upset when you had all the
different variations. That was just one,

664
00:36:38,101 --> 00:36:41,850
one time where I was like,
this is the most ridiculous job on earth.

665
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:46,020
The other time was when we served
them. Um, donkey seaman. Ugh, that's,

666
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:49,830
that's what canceled the show. They got
so crazy. They serve donkey seating.

667
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:54,480
The producers lost their fucking minds
and soda at NBC because NBC said Yes to

668
00:36:54,481 --> 00:36:57,330
it. That's the dirty secret about
the last season of fear factor.

669
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:59,760
They approved NBC approved,

670
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:03,840
sucking down a big golf of
donkey come. They're like, Yup,

671
00:37:03,841 --> 00:37:08,100
that seems like good thing to put on
TV. Let her rip as disgusting. Dude.

672
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:08,760
It was the only time.

673
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:12,030
There's only been two times when I
disagreed with the producers. I said,

674
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:16,020
you really shouldn't do this. One time
when we made them ride bowls, I was like,

675
00:37:16,021 --> 00:37:19,500
this is crazy. This is, you can't
control this. This is, this is not good.

676
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:23,230
I didn't like it. And then the other
time when we made them drink calm,

677
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:27,540
I just never thought I'd have to say that.
I'd never thought I'd have to say,

678
00:37:27,541 --> 00:37:29,800
I don't think he should serve those
people at donkey coffee. It's just,

679
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:33,150
it just doesn't see,
it just seems like we're crossing a line.

680
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:35,820
If you'd like this job
and you want to keep it,

681
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,910
and then TMZ got ahold of it,

682
00:37:38,911 --> 00:37:43,911
they put the pictures of it online and
then NBC said Polish Owl Polish out.

683
00:37:43,981 --> 00:37:46,980
They pulled the episode.
What response did they expect?

684
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,650
They were thinking,
man,

685
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:53,730
if I'm the guy who's telling you
you're crossing the line. Yeah,

686
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:55,220
you're already there.

687
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:58,770
You know I'm a pothead cage fighting
commentator and I'm telling you,

688
00:37:58,771 --> 00:38:02,160
you're going to far,
everything in my life is fucked up.

689
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:06,060
Every everything I do, whether it's
standup comedy or this podcast,

690
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:09,420
everything could be considered fucked
up. And I'm like, you're going crazy.

691
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:12,860
I'm like, you get it. You get
into chicky over here. You gotta,

692
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,090
you gotta let that one go.
You can't, they can't drink.

693
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:18,150
Come and pissed by the way we serve them.
Pissed too.

694
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,430
Nobody seem to care as
much about the piss.

695
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:21,900
I wouldn't care as much about the past.

696
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:26,280
The past is they just drank it and
nobody complained about the pit.

697
00:38:26,281 --> 00:38:29,310
So it was always the donkey come
and it always was like, again,

698
00:38:29,311 --> 00:38:33,450
it was like some sort of beastiality thing
in people's minds because it's a body

699
00:38:33,451 --> 00:38:36,120
fluid and we know where it came from.
Like milk.

700
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:38,290
Yeah, but it's not like we're
asking them to have sex.

701
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:42,940
It's so funny a week people connect,
flex sex with the fluids at sex creates,

702
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,640
you know,
it's like drinking the like,

703
00:38:45,641 --> 00:38:49,000
you know you're no where near that
donkey when it comes, but drinking,

704
00:38:49,001 --> 00:38:52,570
it's come somehow or another
is a sex with that donkey.

705
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:54,440
I'm not sure I could rationalize myself.

706
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:58,050
The drinking donkey come like as hard
as I tried to make it into the like and

707
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:59,080
thought exercise.

708
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:02,860
Well what's fucked up is two people
had a drink and they didn't want shit.

709
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:05,980
That's what's fucked up cause
everybody drank it. Yeah.

710
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:09,700
One guy and two girls drank
it and they were nice people.

711
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:12,010
That's what's even more fucked
up than there were very nice.

712
00:39:12,011 --> 00:39:15,510
Always the nice quiet time drank the
donkey semen for all of them. They were,

713
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,470
I mean it was like he took,

714
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,230
occasionally you have a show where
someone will try too hard or they're build

715
00:39:20,231 --> 00:39:21,790
noxious.
We didn't have any of that.

716
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:23,890
This last season of fear
factor was they were,

717
00:39:23,891 --> 00:39:26,320
everyone was like really there a knife.
Nice folks.

718
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:30,300
So I felt bad sitting down
there drinking talky come.

719
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:35,140
I'd hate to see it digested like the
next morning shit sitting on the toilet

720
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:39,130
blowing out. Quite honestly.
It's very similar to phlegm.

721
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,940
So it's like drinking almost like
drinking a big glass of phlegm.

722
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:48,050
You know it's really very similar. It's
very similar in its texture. And you know,

723
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,130
I dunno about taste cause you
know I never tried phlegm.

724
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:55,570
Ha wonder if you get the job,

725
00:39:57,910 --> 00:39:59,160
where the fuck is his podcast?

726
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:01,660
What have you flagged when you
flush the toilet after digesting,

727
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:04,330
if it's like a super fast,
like a flesh is really,

728
00:40:04,331 --> 00:40:07,780
really fast because it's slippery
because of all the phlegm, right? Hmm.

729
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:11,440
I don't know what kind of,
Oh what the fuck you're saying

730
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:14,740
you need to go to a doctor.

731
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:19,180
Frill need to go to a doctor and just
tell him that you propose that and he'll

732
00:40:19,181 --> 00:40:23,320
sit you down and go,
something's wrong with your brain.

733
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:28,690
Um, so, uh, your first deer hunting
experience was in North Carolina,

734
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:32,560
was it South Carolina? Which
is the gun. Oh, would you?

735
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:33,970
It was gone.
I didn't want to,

736
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:39,000
my biggest fear going into all
of that was fucking up the shot.

737
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:44,520
It was really worried about just maiming
the deer and then it takes away like

738
00:40:45,481 --> 00:40:48,490
hitting of the leg or something. I was
really worried about that. So I took,

739
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:51,290
I really got into the
marksmanship super serious.

740
00:40:51,291 --> 00:40:53,770
It was actually just down here a couple
of weeks ago doing sniper training with

741
00:40:53,771 --> 00:40:57,430
some of the La Swat team members.
Oh yeah. There's a great,

742
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:01,360
a company called itts that does
trainings are fucking, they were great.

743
00:41:01,361 --> 00:41:04,090
But prior to that,
so that the deer,

744
00:41:04,091 --> 00:41:09,091
I used a seven millimeter Remington
mag that I actually use Steve's gun,

745
00:41:10,961 --> 00:41:14,230
which is a lefthanded too. It's
a nice gun. It's great gun.

746
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:18,550
I have since had a right handed version
of that made with a couple of changes.

747
00:41:18,551 --> 00:41:22,770
So it's like a his and hers, soon
millimeter of Steve Vernella now. Nice.

748
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:27,300
But I used, I used his gun and a man, he's
a great teacher. I mean that's part of,

749
00:41:27,301 --> 00:41:29,800
there's, I want to put them in the
book. He is a fucking outstanding,

750
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:31,870
outstanding teacher.
Well he knows what he's doing.

751
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:36,260
All aspects of uh,
the whole a hunting thing cause it's his,

752
00:41:36,261 --> 00:41:40,840
his attachment to it isn't
just hunting. It's also to, um,

753
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:43,360
just the,
the history of the United States and,

754
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:46,710
and the people that lived
in the land of the, the uh,

755
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,760
American Indian hitter
heritage and the stories.

756
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:53,750
He had some amazing American
Indian stories. Like really, uh,

757
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:56,090
I should say native American stories.
Really,

758
00:41:56,091 --> 00:41:59,780
really interesting stuff about that
whole area where we went to Montana,

759
00:41:59,781 --> 00:42:02,720
to the Missouri River.
The rosary breaks. Yeah.

760
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:06,080
And he had just incredible stories,
story after story.

761
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:11,350
So he's a guy that like really embraces
the history of a region two and the,

762
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:14,980
the history of the wildlife there as well.
How the uh,

763
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:19,540
migrate with the numbers used to be like,
and you know, we, we occasionally would,

764
00:42:19,541 --> 00:42:19,700
uh,

765
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:23,300
look for buffalo bones cause they're
like really common in the sides of hills.

766
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:26,540
You know, you see like the, when
the Strada wears away you'll,

767
00:42:26,541 --> 00:42:31,370
you'll find like these old ass
fucking buffalo bolts. Krill. Yeah,

768
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,470
that's super cool. It's
pretty bad ass. And Steve,

769
00:42:33,471 --> 00:42:37,190
I mean he grew up hunting with his
brothers. Obviously this dad as well.

770
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:40,730
And I think his brothers,
they're both in the sciences,

771
00:42:40,731 --> 00:42:44,750
but I believe they're Bostick both
ecologists and it's just such,

772
00:42:44,751 --> 00:42:47,000
it's a fascinating family.
And I mean Steve,

773
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:51,290
I guess he's been writing for money
for whatever it is, a decade maybe.

774
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:55,070
But he started trapping
in from honey in Rome,

775
00:42:55,071 --> 00:42:57,860
Michigan and he was like 10. Yeah. Yeah.

776
00:42:57,861 --> 00:43:02,630
He was talking about how his dad pulled
him out of school for a first day of

777
00:43:02,631 --> 00:43:07,610
trap and, and first day of hunting
season. That's like how he grew up.

778
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,480
I think that's fucking awesome.
But it's,

779
00:43:09,481 --> 00:43:12,860
it's fascinating because
everybody immediately, if
you think of a guy like that,

780
00:43:12,861 --> 00:43:16,010
you think of a dumb guy. You think of
an uneducated guy and unworldly guy,

781
00:43:16,011 --> 00:43:19,400
he's the exact opposite of total opposite.
Brilliant guy, brilliant guy. Very,

782
00:43:19,401 --> 00:43:23,300
very well read and a really
fun to talk to. You know,

783
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:25,290
he's inquisitive is intelligent,
you know,

784
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:28,460
he's on the ball but he's the
real fucking deal, you know?

785
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:31,970
And he expects that from other
people as well. You know,

786
00:43:31,971 --> 00:43:34,660
you go on a hunt with them, you're
going on. I mean you're, you're going,

787
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:38,210
it's legit. Yeah. When we were in
Alaska where we got dropped off,

788
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:42,950
I was like five hours in
north of Fairbanks flight
time and we got dropped off

789
00:43:42,951 --> 00:43:46,610
on the side of a lake by a Bush plan.
And I like seeing awake pace.

790
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:49,910
I'll get eaten by bears.
And then Lo and behold,

791
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:51,620
it never got dark because we were,

792
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:56,890
we were above the Arctic circle and we
had two huge grizzly bears repeatedly

793
00:43:57,650 --> 00:44:01,280
tried to come into our camp because the
people before us would let the fucking

794
00:44:01,281 --> 00:44:06,281
gut pile of Caribou like 200 yards upwind.

795
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:10,400
So we had these two huge
bears come in and uh,

796
00:44:10,401 --> 00:44:14,660
Steve was so funny cause everyone's like,
oh fuck grizzly bear like 10 o'clock.

797
00:44:14,661 --> 00:44:17,090
And it's like, I dunno, ETA three minutes.

798
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:21,200
And then Steve found that his found
out his cell phone had been like in the

799
00:44:21,201 --> 00:44:24,110
bottom of his bag and was
soaked with deet. And he's like,

800
00:44:24,111 --> 00:44:26,690
fuck my fucking cell phone.
Everyone's like Steve,

801
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:30,270
a grizzly bear ETA three minutes.
He's like my fucking cell phone.

802
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,240
She's like so unconcerned about this
grizzly bear. And then he's just like,

803
00:44:33,241 --> 00:44:34,890
all right, fine, fuck it.
And he picks up a shotgun,

804
00:44:34,891 --> 00:44:38,490
like walks over with birdshot like starts
firing it off and waving his arms and

805
00:44:38,491 --> 00:44:41,880
scaring it off from like,
that's all you need to do a hundred yards.

806
00:44:41,881 --> 00:44:45,200
But here's the thing, a hundred yards to
a bear, that's not a slow animal. Right?

807
00:44:45,201 --> 00:44:46,920
So he's got some big balls.

808
00:44:46,921 --> 00:44:50,400
I scared it off the thing that
running back like two hours later,

809
00:44:50,410 --> 00:44:53,090
but to say about him after he gets
fucking eaten, you know exactly.

810
00:44:53,091 --> 00:44:55,710
He big balls and the
bear ultimately eight.

811
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:57,750
So they set about grizzly
man until the very end.

812
00:44:57,751 --> 00:45:02,550
He really knows those bears
stay safe. Yeah. I think Steve,

813
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:05,430
Steve is fine to be within a hundred yards
of the bear as long as he has a good,

814
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:08,330
a good a firearm. Yeah.
You got to really, um,

815
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,680
when you straw inspecting
the fucking Grizzly,

816
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:14,160
that's when the grizzly takes
care of you to shoot a grizzly.

817
00:45:14,161 --> 00:45:16,680
Like you can't shoot it with
like a little pistol. No.

818
00:45:16,681 --> 00:45:19,860
You need to hit it with like a slug
because you're not going to stop them.

819
00:45:19,861 --> 00:45:23,160
It's going to take years for them to die.
Like if you shoot it,

820
00:45:23,570 --> 00:45:26,380
if you shoot a big grizzly with a
fucking nine millimeter, you know,

821
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,760
he tried to go gangster rapper style on
them. That's not going to kill a bear.

822
00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:34,440
Keep running at you and you're going
to be so scared when it eats your head.

823
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:35,303
Yeah.

824
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:40,400
If people underestimate how hard
it is to kill an animal like that,

825
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:42,700
depending on the circumstances.

826
00:45:42,701 --> 00:45:47,320
I was talking to a friend of mine who's
a navy seal and he sees still enlisted,

827
00:45:47,321 --> 00:45:48,940
I mean he does deployments and everything,

828
00:45:48,941 --> 00:45:53,350
but he was at one point in Africa and
these villagers in sort of the downtime

829
00:45:53,410 --> 00:45:55,210
knew these guys were with the
military and they said, hey,

830
00:45:55,211 --> 00:45:58,980
could you help us call this herd of water
buffalo because they're destroying all

831
00:45:58,981 --> 00:46:01,740
our property and blah blah blah.
We can make food out of the boat,

832
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:03,670
the buffalo that you
kill you. I'm like, sure.

833
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:08,650
So they had these long range sniping
rifles and he said that and he's a damn

834
00:46:08,651 --> 00:46:10,660
good shot.
I've done some training with them and he,

835
00:46:10,830 --> 00:46:15,830
and he said that he shot a water buffalo
right in the corner of the eye and the

836
00:46:15,941 --> 00:46:19,600
thing like shook his head and then looked
straight back at him and just kept on

837
00:46:19,601 --> 00:46:23,080
eating. Like what? Yeah, the
fucking skulls like that thick.

838
00:46:23,081 --> 00:46:26,470
And it had like gone halfway in the
skull and just lodged with a high power

839
00:46:26,471 --> 00:46:28,330
rifle.
And the thing just kept on eating.

840
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:33,540
And so like that is what would happen if
you didn't place your shot with a bear.

841
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:35,500
And forget it.

842
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:39,630
Like if the grizzly powered rifle and it
couldn't get through his fucking head,

843
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:40,900
they had to aim the,

844
00:46:40,901 --> 00:46:43,900
ended up having to aim at the base of
the skull from the side of the bag.

845
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:47,260
It's don't shoot him in the head.
Became the, became the rule.

846
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:51,190
That's a big fucking animal.
Yeah. Well when I was, uh,

847
00:46:51,370 --> 00:46:55,120
I was in Africa doing research for this
book too. I went on to India, Japan,

848
00:46:55,121 --> 00:46:57,850
all over the place.
Then in the one lunar in South Africa.

849
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:02,560
What a buffalo kill everybody. I mean,
people are afraid of that. The lions,

850
00:47:02,561 --> 00:47:04,510
but you, if you meet,
let's say the Masai Mara,

851
00:47:04,511 --> 00:47:07,330
these warriors who are like jump up
and down, the famous for the red robes,

852
00:47:07,870 --> 00:47:09,430
they're not free to lines at all.
They will,

853
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:12,640
they'll walk off into the darkness with
their big walking stick going from one

854
00:47:12,641 --> 00:47:13,960
village to the next. They're like, Eh,

855
00:47:13,961 --> 00:47:18,340
like big house cats will scare him off
water, Buffalo, hippo and elephants.

856
00:47:18,341 --> 00:47:20,710
Those are the ones that are all afraid
of because they'll just charge you and

857
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,280
kill you.
Yeah.

858
00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:27,660
Water buffaloes are big fuck and
tourists get out of their cars on safari.

859
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:30,190
They're like, oh, let's take a
picture with the, and then the cows

860
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:33,100
are like cow Lamborghini
bowls and then they get,

861
00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:35,800
I've talked about this a
bunch lately, so I can't, uh,

862
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:39,550
I can't really go into it again, but yeah.
Have you seen relentless enemies? No.

863
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:40,720
This was what I'm talking about.

864
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:44,030
I've talked about it so many times
in the podcast. You have to watch it.

865
00:47:44,210 --> 00:47:45,041
It's a documentary.

866
00:47:45,041 --> 00:47:48,450
I'll just give you the brief documentary
about a part of Africa where the rivers

867
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:52,090
changed courses and it's isolated.
These lions with water buffalo,

868
00:47:52,091 --> 00:47:55,210
that's their only prey.
So the lines of grown enormous.

869
00:47:55,450 --> 00:47:59,050
The female lions are the size of male
lions. It's an amazing documentary.

870
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:03,070
There's a couple different prides in the
silent, but one of them is fucking huge.

871
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:06,850
They're like hulk lions. That's awesome.
They just jack and water buffaloes, man.

872
00:48:06,851 --> 00:48:08,080
That's how they have to do it now.

873
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:13,210
And you see how big a fucking water
buffalo is when you see five lions

874
00:48:13,211 --> 00:48:17,650
struggling to take it to stay down
there. No joke. Fuck that man.

875
00:48:17,651 --> 00:48:20,370
If you see when those things in
the wild do not fuck with it. Yeah.

876
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:23,770
Apparently back in the day,
like that was a big deal with buffalo too.

877
00:48:23,771 --> 00:48:26,710
Like if you, if you got near at
Buffalo and the buffalo charged you,

878
00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:31,620
I saw a video of a guy getting charged
by a buffalo on youtube. You know,

879
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:34,660
you don't think for whatever reason
that you're gonna die by Buffalo.

880
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:40,080
But that moment when that thing is going
through and you realize how fucking big

881
00:48:40,811 --> 00:48:42,770
it is and you go,
what am I doing here?

882
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:48,120
I'm in fun of this crazy fucking
star wars looking animal. Yeah.

883
00:48:48,121 --> 00:48:51,790
You're going to get hit by something
always weighs more than a Volkswagen Golf

884
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:56,920
with, with skull plates on the its
head, not gonna end well at all.

885
00:48:56,921 --> 00:49:01,921
It must have been amazing back in the
day when the native Americans would run

886
00:49:02,411 --> 00:49:07,411
into these Kurds that was far as the eye
could see of these things because they

887
00:49:07,601 --> 00:49:11,530
really didn't have many natural
predators. No, not at all. I mean wolves,

888
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:15,330
but it takes a lot fricking wolves
to take down a buffalo. Yeah,

889
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:18,970
they probably were fine.
It must have been so many wolves.

890
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:23,290
The wolves Musta ate great
because there was so many buffalo.

891
00:49:23,590 --> 00:49:28,210
What other being after the saber tooth
tiger, which was what? The place to scene,

892
00:49:28,211 --> 00:49:31,150
what was that like 14,000 years ago?
Was that what it was when the,

893
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:35,230
the wooly mammoths and saber tooth
tigers also she goes to what other animal

894
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:36,250
would eat them?

895
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:39,810
It will only be wolves and mountain lions
where I could a mountain lion even I

896
00:49:39,870 --> 00:49:40,301
take out,

897
00:49:40,301 --> 00:49:44,680
I don't think so because I think mount
line more as a stock and pounds type of

898
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:47,340
animals opposed to the
endurance running like,

899
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,600
I don't know if you've seen planet earth,

900
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:53,470
the series where they have an
aerial shot of wolves hunting.

901
00:49:53,471 --> 00:49:58,471
I think it was a Caribou may have been
an elk and how they basically the wolves

902
00:49:58,631 --> 00:50:01,760
would run, this is trippiest thing.
When you see it from the air, they'll,

903
00:50:01,810 --> 00:50:03,880
they're almost like a Peloton
and the Tour de France,

904
00:50:03,881 --> 00:50:07,600
so they have like the wolf in the front
who is tiring out the Caribou and then

905
00:50:07,601 --> 00:50:11,100
like the replacement runner will come
from the back and fill in and that guy

906
00:50:11,101 --> 00:50:15,640
will drop back and say they just run
this relay race where they, they,

907
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:20,820
they tag in and tag out on running this
animal until it drops and then then they

908
00:50:21,551 --> 00:50:26,260
take it out. Holy Shit. Like persistence
hunting sort of. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah,

909
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,070
exactly.
Which they still do and certain

910
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:30,080
parts of Africa they,
they'll chase over. Yeah.

911
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:34,170
Gazelle or whatever the fuck it is down
until it just runs out of gas. Yeah,

912
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:38,090
pretty wild. And then they stab
it. Fuck. How long does that take?

913
00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:41,240
I guess that could only be done in a
place like Africa where you need the heat

914
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:44,390
and you'd also need the higher heat. Oh,
right, right, right. Animal to overheat.

915
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:45,710
You right, right, right.

916
00:50:45,711 --> 00:50:48,740
That makes sense because that was
the weirdest thing about a deer.

917
00:50:48,741 --> 00:50:51,740
When you open them up, how hot they
are and the only side it's like,

918
00:50:51,741 --> 00:50:55,300
it's really kind of like, whoa.
It's a real eye opener. Yeah.

919
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:58,760
What was really trippy. So the
field dressing, right. So I was,

920
00:50:58,850 --> 00:51:03,140
I was much more interested in what happens
after pulling the trigger then before

921
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:05,750
you stock this dear.
How'd you do it this year?

922
00:51:05,751 --> 00:51:08,750
The first year this was done from blind,
so it was really,

923
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,240
didn't have to work as hard on the hunt.

924
00:51:11,270 --> 00:51:14,300
Certainly compared to Caribou with
the Caribou, we did have to stock.

925
00:51:14,510 --> 00:51:16,790
So you did both with Rinella?
We did both. Which is an ally.

926
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:18,040
And the first one when,

927
00:51:18,110 --> 00:51:23,110
how long ago was it first one that had
to be a year and a half ago or maybe even

928
00:51:23,121 --> 00:51:27,590
a slightly less because he had
the other show the wild within?

929
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,920
Uh, no, no, I don't think
so. It was a new show.

930
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:35,490
So the deer hunt was not filmed for
mediator. The caribou hunt was a,

931
00:51:35,570 --> 00:51:37,760
for me to hit her.
So the deer hunt was just you guys?

932
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:41,270
The deer hunt was just because I, I
met Steve and I said, you're my guy.

933
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:44,830
If I am ever going to hunt,
like you're the guy who's good,

934
00:51:44,850 --> 00:51:49,850
who is the best option for
guiding this and got along and uh,

935
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:55,160
both have pretty fucking strange senses
of humor and went to South Carolina and

936
00:51:55,161 --> 00:51:57,800
you think he has a strange sense of humor?
I think he has a,

937
00:51:57,860 --> 00:52:01,330
he can depends on how much wine we've had.
Uh,

938
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:03,080
when we were camping,

939
00:52:03,081 --> 00:52:06,770
what was great is we had these fucking
bags of wine because they were from the

940
00:52:06,771 --> 00:52:09,260
boxes, but they had been taken out
and they looked just like an ivy bag.

941
00:52:09,290 --> 00:52:12,770
So I've been like fantasizing about
getting these like rolling carts from the

942
00:52:12,771 --> 00:52:13,161
hospital,

943
00:52:13,161 --> 00:52:16,880
like supply store and just get any
fucking ivy bags of wine that people can

944
00:52:16,881 --> 00:52:19,850
drink for like a camel back at dinner,
just to creep the shit out of everybody.

945
00:52:19,890 --> 00:52:23,410
Those camelbaks or fun.
Either you, you, um,

946
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:26,390
you were in a warm weather area.

947
00:52:26,391 --> 00:52:30,300
Was it a warm weather time
south in South Carolina? It was.

948
00:52:30,301 --> 00:52:32,780
So we had to be really careful
about keeping all the meat cool.

949
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,670
That's part of the
reasons that you need to,

950
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:39,710
one of the reasons you need to remove the
internal organs so quickly so that the

951
00:52:39,711 --> 00:52:42,200
meat doesn't spoil. Right. And uh,

952
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:47,450
what was super trippy for me because I've
just never experienced anything quite

953
00:52:47,451 --> 00:52:50,060
like it was when I was
doing the field dressing,

954
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:53,480
maybe a minute or two into the process.

955
00:52:53,810 --> 00:52:58,810
Like I just felt like I had done it
before and I had this like hard wiring

956
00:52:59,661 --> 00:53:03,380
moment where, uh, I was just
really good at it and it's done.

957
00:53:03,410 --> 00:53:04,640
That doesn't happen with many things.

958
00:53:04,641 --> 00:53:07,220
And I was starting to ice and made me
think about like how to orphan cats,

959
00:53:07,221 --> 00:53:10,310
know how to hunt, how to orphan
to anything, fill in the blank.

960
00:53:10,510 --> 00:53:13,130
I see no more specific than
knowing how to hunt. But I mean,

961
00:53:13,150 --> 00:53:17,420
it just like to take it apart and it
felt so natural going through it. Well,

962
00:53:17,421 --> 00:53:20,270
how'd she has been with obviously this,
you're a very smart guy,

963
00:53:20,271 --> 00:53:22,790
so this had been something you had
considered for quite a while before you

964
00:53:22,791 --> 00:53:26,030
actually went hunting. But I never read
about the field dressing because I want

965
00:53:26,030 --> 00:53:30,180
it to have an intellectually honest
first experience for my readers and to be

966
00:53:30,181 --> 00:53:33,420
able to convey that to them. So I did
not study butchering field dressing,

967
00:53:33,421 --> 00:53:36,420
anything. The only thing I
studied was the marksmanship,

968
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:37,650
so it didn't want to fuck it up.

969
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:41,490
One of the things I liked about his show
as opposed to a lot of other hunting

970
00:53:41,491 --> 00:53:45,000
shows was the fact that he did do a
lot of the field dressing on the air,

971
00:53:45,270 --> 00:53:48,270
did show you what was going on.
So I had a better sense of it.

972
00:53:48,271 --> 00:53:51,720
I'd seen a lot of hunting shows before.
Like I'd watch Ted Nugent's show a lot,

973
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:56,060
but um, he doesn't clean them as
much and it doesn't like do it.

974
00:53:56,080 --> 00:54:00,420
You'll do it occasionally, but Steve did
it quite a bit and it was very, you know,

975
00:54:00,421 --> 00:54:03,300
you get to see like that's, that's
realistic shit man. Like that's,

976
00:54:03,301 --> 00:54:07,590
you really see what an animals like when
you get a steak, you know, okay, this is,

977
00:54:07,591 --> 00:54:10,950
let's back it up. Here's the
animal, now it's dropped.

978
00:54:10,951 --> 00:54:13,440
Now you open it and then you
turn it to stake, like, Whoa,

979
00:54:13,470 --> 00:54:17,160
that's a completely different
experience. And uh, it was,

980
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:20,100
it was fascinating to go
through it for the first time,

981
00:54:20,101 --> 00:54:23,850
but also document the whole thing in
terms of photos and videos and everything

982
00:54:23,851 --> 00:54:28,230
else all the way until that night
when we had some backstraps.

983
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:31,580
She kind of like the spinal erectors.
Dude. You're talking like a hunter? Yeah,

984
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:36,060
well I'm using Stevie,
Steve Rainelda's Vocab,

985
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:39,110
a Yolo, the backstraps. It was
trippy about that because I'm,

986
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:42,180
I think about anatomy just in terms
of training and weightlifting,

987
00:54:42,210 --> 00:54:46,110
deadlifts and blah, blah, blah. And so
thinking like a back strap since then,

988
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:48,310
I went back to,
uh,

989
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:51,720
where we were staying with a guy named
Dave amick who builds custom rifles.

990
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:55,710
And they had this little
labradoodle that came around,

991
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:59,010
was play with a labradoodle. And I
started like feeling it's back and it's,

992
00:54:59,011 --> 00:55:00,660
anatomy was so weird and I was like,

993
00:55:00,990 --> 00:55:04,440
is it weird that I'm like
looking for backstraps on
this labradoodle? No, no, no,

994
00:55:04,441 --> 00:55:07,590
no, no. And Steve's like,
don't worry. Like I, when I
give my wife a back massage,

995
00:55:07,591 --> 00:55:10,200
I think the same thing.
So weird.

996
00:55:10,201 --> 00:55:13,200
But it's like when you're actually taking
an animal part and thinking about the

997
00:55:13,201 --> 00:55:13,591
anatomy,

998
00:55:13,591 --> 00:55:18,180
you start seeing those cuts in that
anatomy and like everything that moves,

999
00:55:18,181 --> 00:55:20,070
it's really fucking weird.
Well,

1000
00:55:20,071 --> 00:55:25,071
when you see an animal for a purveyor
of meat and now you see it as a meat

1001
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:31,010
container. Yeah, new experience.
Yeah. It's weird. I went to Chrysler

1002
00:55:31,350 --> 00:55:33,420
Birthday party last night and
they had one of those things.

1003
00:55:33,421 --> 00:55:37,080
It was like a box where you put a pig
inside and then you put like coals on top

1004
00:55:37,081 --> 00:55:41,900
of the box a bit and they buried
underground or something. But again,

1005
00:55:41,970 --> 00:55:44,460
I guess it cooks faster
than burying it underground.

1006
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:48,000
It only takes like three to four
hours or something like that. But uh,

1007
00:55:48,150 --> 00:55:51,780
it was amazing watching them take
the pig out and then like Burt,

1008
00:55:51,781 --> 00:55:54,760
which is digging in their like taking
out parts of the pig and then like,

1009
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:58,080
then cutting out the meat. This is
Burt's birthday cards, birthday party.

1010
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:02,770
It made me feel like such a pussy
watching like all these men. Just,

1011
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:06,930
I'd taken this pig apart like,
like they all knew exactly what to do.

1012
00:56:06,931 --> 00:56:09,370
Like I would be like disgusted by it,
but eh

1013
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:11,760
really?
So you look at like the whole pig,

1014
00:56:11,761 --> 00:56:15,480
you were like this is too much seeing
the whole pig. It was really creepy.

1015
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:16,170
It was creepy.

1016
00:56:16,170 --> 00:56:19,880
I thought it was creepy to watch because
it's an actual body instead of like cut

1017
00:56:19,881 --> 00:56:21,330
of box.
Makes it creepier though.

1018
00:56:21,331 --> 00:56:24,130
Cause it's like a coffin
for a instead of just being

1019
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:26,770
in the ground. Yeah. You think? Yeah.

1020
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:28,380
I, I think um, the,

1021
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:32,180
that never really bothered me but maybe
I looked at things differently. I Dunno.

1022
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:36,680
Maybe if I wasn't, it snuck up on me.
I've been thinking about it for so long,

1023
00:56:37,430 --> 00:56:40,600
but by the time I went hunting I'd
been thinking about it for at least 10

1024
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:43,210
near, so I wanted to do it for
at least 10 years. I'd always,

1025
00:56:43,211 --> 00:56:46,930
I'd always wanted to feel
more conscious and aware,

1026
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:51,130
just like responsible for the food that
I eat, including the meat. And I just,

1027
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:54,100
I didn't know that someone like
Steve existed, you know what I mean?

1028
00:56:54,430 --> 00:56:58,000
It's like men. And then I'm like, yeah,
well I don't think there's many like him.

1029
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:03,490
Maybe his brothers. Yeah, there's
the pig laying in that. Oh,

1030
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:06,280
that's wild. That's Kinda
creepy. Looking at that pig.

1031
00:57:06,281 --> 00:57:10,420
Looks like it looks like a refrigerator
that looks like a Peta advertisement.

1032
00:57:10,470 --> 00:57:14,660
Yeah. Right. And then, then
there's a, that's sorry.

1033
00:57:15,550 --> 00:57:20,010
Then like the pig head. Oh, chimney
Burt's body. Like a photo of Bert.

1034
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:24,820
Oh, the head is certainly
weird. That's cool though.

1035
00:57:24,821 --> 00:57:28,180
The pig cooking like a pig on a spit,

1036
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:31,570
essentially a whole pig.
And they did it at his place.

1037
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:35,520
It was pretty sweet and
his man cave. And uh, I,

1038
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:39,890
I completely understand by the way,
where everyone's coming from, Vegan

1039
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:40,880
everyone was coming from,

1040
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:44,030
was a complete animal lover and doesn't
want to have anything to do with eating

1041
00:57:44,031 --> 00:57:46,430
meat.
I fucking here.

1042
00:57:46,431 --> 00:57:49,610
And I think it's a very
noble way of thinking.

1043
00:57:49,611 --> 00:57:51,560
If you really look at what they're doing,

1044
00:57:51,561 --> 00:57:56,561
they're essentially trying to be a part
of the next stage of evolution when it's

1045
00:57:57,321 --> 00:58:01,760
done through the right or the most
moral for the more, most moral reasons.

1046
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:06,140
They're trying to exist with the
very minimal Karma with no death, no,

1047
00:58:06,141 --> 00:58:07,400
no damage to the planet.

1048
00:58:07,850 --> 00:58:12,470
But the reality of this
environment that we live in now,

1049
00:58:12,650 --> 00:58:14,510
this world is this existence,

1050
00:58:14,511 --> 00:58:17,900
this of this dimension that we live in
now and said these animals, everyone,

1051
00:58:17,901 --> 00:58:21,890
these are all temporary, everyone's and
some of them are, they're dumb as fuck.

1052
00:58:22,070 --> 00:58:24,710
Okay, this is, this is this
whole system going on here.

1053
00:58:24,890 --> 00:58:28,970
Like you've got to recognize this
system where we're attaching morals to

1054
00:58:29,030 --> 00:58:34,030
something that's just natural everyday
process of animals consuming animals.

1055
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:37,940
And in order for you to,
you must recognize you are an animal.

1056
00:58:38,090 --> 00:58:42,080
And in order for this animal body to
work at its best really achieved eat

1057
00:58:42,081 --> 00:58:45,770
animals. You know, that's the, I mean
you can live and exist as a Vegan.

1058
00:58:45,771 --> 00:58:48,140
There's a lot of top vegan
athletes like Mac Danzig.

1059
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:51,950
He's a high level Vegan athlete.
But maybe he'd be better if he ate meat.

1060
00:58:51,951 --> 00:58:55,130
It's possible, you know, if you
listen to guys like Dave Asprey,

1061
00:58:55,131 --> 00:58:57,050
they'd tell you the science behind,
you know,

1062
00:58:57,051 --> 00:59:01,910
eating actual animal matter and
what that does to your nerves,

1063
00:59:01,911 --> 00:59:04,670
the way your body performs.
The way your body can move.

1064
00:59:04,970 --> 00:59:08,570
I don't know if he's right.
I'm too stupid. Too stupid
to really know who's right.

1065
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:12,240
But it sounds to me like the,
the,

1066
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:16,010
the people that are trying to be vegans.
I like what I liked,

1067
00:59:16,011 --> 00:59:18,530
what that stands for.
I like what that stands for.

1068
00:59:18,530 --> 00:59:22,040
That stands for people that recognize that
like fan. So I'm them doing something,

1069
00:59:22,041 --> 00:59:24,230
I'm effecting something.
I don't want to be a part of it,

1070
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:28,340
but if you want to live in a society,
the reality is if you like, you know,

1071
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:33,400
we've sort of like distanced ourself
from what we're doing by not having most

1072
00:59:35,211 --> 00:59:38,150
people involved with the actual
taking of the animal's life.

1073
00:59:38,270 --> 00:59:42,230
So even though you're a part of the chain
of command or the chain of evidence or

1074
00:59:42,231 --> 00:59:46,790
the chain of matter from, from a
living animal to stake you, you're not,

1075
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:49,220
you've got nothing connected to it.

1076
00:59:49,370 --> 00:59:51,590
So there's a lot of people
that are wearing leather.

1077
00:59:51,830 --> 00:59:54,440
There's a lot of people that are
eating cheeseburgers and they're like,

1078
00:59:54,441 --> 00:59:58,070
I could never go hunting. And you're
like, well that's kind of crazy. Yeah,

1079
00:59:58,310 --> 01:00:01,220
that seems like,
that seems like it's Kinda crazy.

1080
01:00:01,590 --> 01:00:05,940
No, I, yeah, I totally agree. Number
one. And uh, I would also say, you know,

1081
01:00:05,941 --> 01:00:10,710
what a lot of people don't realize
is the industrially farmed meat,

1082
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:14,040
and I'll use the term farmed very loosely,

1083
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:19,100
but he's extremely damaging to the
ecosystem and ecological sustainability,

1084
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:25,080
the US. But what they miss is
like monocrop, like wheat, soy,

1085
01:00:25,110 --> 01:00:29,820
corn are arguable,
arguably equally or more damaging.

1086
01:00:29,850 --> 01:00:31,500
And I think that what a,

1087
01:00:31,501 --> 01:00:36,501
so one of the things that made me want
to actually explore food more is that in

1088
01:00:36,841 --> 01:00:38,160
the next 10 years or so,

1089
01:00:38,161 --> 01:00:40,650
I met with a lot of really
interesting people like Sam Kass,

1090
01:00:40,651 --> 01:00:43,230
who's the private chef for
the Obamas at the White House,

1091
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:47,250
also does a lot of food politics. And we
know the chef of the White House. I, yeah,

1092
01:00:47,251 --> 01:00:50,610
I've met him before.
He says Obama like to eat a weld.

1093
01:00:50,611 --> 01:00:52,560
The meals he told me about where fish.

1094
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:55,480
So he would like go out and catch the
fish and then bring them in and cook them

1095
01:00:55,481 --> 01:01:00,090
in a bottle. We catch them. That's not
what I was dancing. The Sam Kass who, uh,

1096
01:01:00,810 --> 01:01:05,370
orange chicken and watermelon,
you son of a son of a bitch,

1097
01:01:06,180 --> 01:01:11,180
but something like 50% or more of the
current small farm owners in the u s are

1098
01:01:13,681 --> 01:01:15,750
set to retire in the
next five to 10 years.

1099
01:01:16,190 --> 01:01:19,830
And what that means is you have
these last of the Mohicans,

1100
01:01:19,890 --> 01:01:24,510
like small family run farms. In many
cases they're going to be up for grabs,

1101
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:28,980
whether that turns into strip malls or
is handed over to Monsanto or some big

1102
01:01:29,340 --> 01:01:31,560
industrial food court or third,

1103
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:34,630
which is really the only
sustainable option that I see is uh,

1104
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:39,400
moving from a few really big producers,
too many smaller producers. Uh,

1105
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:43,140
otherwise there's just too much politics
involved with like subsidies for corn.

1106
01:01:43,430 --> 01:01:44,400
Yeah.
Things of that type.

1107
01:01:44,470 --> 01:01:48,090
Explain to people who don't understand
that because there's a weird thing going

1108
01:01:48,091 --> 01:01:53,091
on with corn there just when you have
a handful of very large industrial food

1109
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:58,400
producers and you have basically a sort
of exchange program between let's say

1110
01:01:59,860 --> 01:02:00,490
the,

1111
01:02:00,490 --> 01:02:04,980
the governmental bodies that regulate
food and the Monsanto's and the kind of

1112
01:02:04,981 --> 01:02:07,090
aggressive the world.
Uh,

1113
01:02:07,170 --> 01:02:12,170
you end up in a really fucked up situation
where there are certain crops that do

1114
01:02:12,421 --> 01:02:16,140
a lot of damage that are forced into the
food supply in everything that you can

1115
01:02:16,141 --> 01:02:18,630
imagine, like corn, she'll be
in everything from certain,

1116
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:23,640
like every condiment you use
to bread that you eat because,

1117
01:02:24,570 --> 01:02:25,403
uh,

1118
01:02:25,830 --> 01:02:30,360
the growth of corn and distribution corn
is subsidized by the u s government,

1119
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:35,660
which makes it possible for farmers to
make money by producing excesses of corn.

1120
01:02:36,930 --> 01:02:40,140
And if you look at, let's say the, uh,

1121
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:44,770
if you look at the top soil
in many of the most, uh,

1122
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:49,590
agriculturally productive states,
they've been reduced from 10,

1123
01:02:49,591 --> 01:02:51,030
15 feet in some cases,

1124
01:02:51,031 --> 01:02:55,620
the less than a foot by constantly
producing the same one or two crops.

1125
01:02:56,220 --> 01:02:59,520
Uh, so in any case, I think
that there's, there's a,

1126
01:02:59,580 --> 01:03:02,530
when you were saying vote with
your dollars, I think it's,

1127
01:03:02,550 --> 01:03:07,550
it's really important to realize that
people are voting for the future of this

1128
01:03:08,131 --> 01:03:10,800
country in many, many ways.
Financial and otherwise,

1129
01:03:10,950 --> 01:03:13,800
certainly from an ecological standpoint,
every time they eat a meal,

1130
01:03:14,250 --> 01:03:18,630
like you're voting three times a day for
what you want in the next 10, 15 years.

1131
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:22,050
Uh, and it's not, I, it's not
going to be reversible. Like once,

1132
01:03:22,350 --> 01:03:26,970
like once that farmland goes away, we're
kind of fucked. I mean, in a lot of ways.

1133
01:03:27,030 --> 01:03:28,980
So anyway,
how did it get to that point?

1134
01:03:29,010 --> 01:03:33,060
How did corn w people that produce corn,
how did the,

1135
01:03:33,090 --> 01:03:35,880
they influence the government to
get them to give him subsidies?

1136
01:03:35,881 --> 01:03:37,680
Was the benefit of them getting subsidies?

1137
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:40,710
They don't know all the historical
context to be perfectly honest.

1138
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:45,020
What is the benefit? Like what is, how do
they sell it? Like giving, well you could,

1139
01:03:45,021 --> 01:03:47,310
they export a lot of corn as well.
Know what I mean? Like how does,

1140
01:03:47,340 --> 01:03:49,620
how does a bill like that get past?
How's,

1141
01:03:49,621 --> 01:03:52,920
how's laws like that get put in the place
where they're subsidizing people for

1142
01:03:52,921 --> 01:03:56,760
growing excess? So hard to say. I
mean there's so many lobbying groups,

1143
01:03:56,761 --> 01:03:59,160
there's so much backdoor dealing.
If you look at,

1144
01:03:59,161 --> 01:04:03,690
let's just say the labeling or non
labeling of GMO food as an example,

1145
01:04:03,691 --> 01:04:06,720
like that was a big issue in
California recently. What did lose?

1146
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:12,050
I can get lost in the state of California.
It's, which is crazy, which is crazy.

1147
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:13,053
Uh,

1148
01:04:14,050 --> 01:04:16,670
sometimes they can word things
where it's confusing as fuck.

1149
01:04:16,671 --> 01:04:20,800
I mean ultimately I think the most direct
path of making a statement is using

1150
01:04:20,801 --> 01:04:24,580
your dollars on the right things,
right? So this is a free market.

1151
01:04:24,581 --> 01:04:26,290
People respond to money.
So it's like if you can,

1152
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:30,520
if you can buy food whenever possible
from smaller producers as opposed to

1153
01:04:30,521 --> 01:04:34,910
bigger producers and closer producers
as opposed to those really far away, uh,

1154
01:04:35,170 --> 01:04:37,540
the healthier you will be,
the better your performance will be.

1155
01:04:37,750 --> 01:04:40,630
And ultimately the less you'll be shackled
to some company that can do it every

1156
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:44,230
once. It's so hard for people to do that.
So, and it costs a lot of money. Like,

1157
01:04:44,231 --> 01:04:46,930
even if you want to eat organic,
that shit so expensive.

1158
01:04:47,170 --> 01:04:49,000
If you want to eat like
really healthy foods,

1159
01:04:49,180 --> 01:04:50,980
if you want to go to the
supermarket and you know,

1160
01:04:50,981 --> 01:04:54,820
go to like a whole foods or something
and get like all grass fed this and it's

1161
01:04:54,821 --> 01:04:58,510
amazing how much more expensive it is
than to go into a market and you get some

1162
01:04:58,511 --> 01:05:03,380
weird looking semi gray steak, take
that pitch home. You know, it's,

1163
01:05:03,820 --> 01:05:04,750
it can be expensive.

1164
01:05:04,780 --> 01:05:09,780
There are a ways out there for people
to make tactical choices for health at

1165
01:05:11,351 --> 01:05:14,170
least about which produce to spend
more money on like their, their,

1166
01:05:14,171 --> 01:05:18,250
their annual lists. For instance,
the clean 15, the dirty dozen

1167
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:23,400
and what all that means is there
are the dirty dozen are the 12 most

1168
01:05:23,981 --> 01:05:26,440
contaminated, uh, produce items,

1169
01:05:26,441 --> 01:05:30,550
vegetables and fruits that exists on
the market in the US and they're stuck

1170
01:05:30,630 --> 01:05:30,880
there.

1171
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:35,470
They're studied every year and chemical
analysis is done and those are the,

1172
01:05:35,650 --> 01:05:36,370
those are the,

1173
01:05:36,370 --> 01:05:39,190
the fruits and veggies that you'll want
to get organically if you can afford it.

1174
01:05:39,191 --> 01:05:40,510
The clean 15 on the other hand,

1175
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:45,040
are foods that even when
produced conventionally with
pesticides, antibiotics,

1176
01:05:45,041 --> 01:05:47,290
et Cetera,
have the lowest levels of contamination.

1177
01:05:47,350 --> 01:05:51,700
So those you can actually feel pretty safe
buying at lower prices conventionally.

1178
01:05:52,100 --> 01:05:52,600
Um,

1179
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:56,470
and a good way for people
to tell if you're getting
screwed by your local grocer

1180
01:05:56,471 --> 01:06:00,610
or not, or tricked is a on
most fruits and vegetables,

1181
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:04,120
you'll find a label or sticker,
right? If it starts with nine,

1182
01:06:04,121 --> 01:06:05,770
it's probably organic.
If it isn't,

1183
01:06:06,130 --> 01:06:09,220
if that number doesn't start with a nine
and then you might be getting beaten,

1184
01:06:09,250 --> 01:06:12,560
switched if they say it's organic.
So really there, what are the,

1185
01:06:12,770 --> 01:06:15,220
what is the standard for organic?

1186
01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:18,580
What does exactly organic does that
mean to science? What does it mean?

1187
01:06:18,610 --> 01:06:22,710
It's a very, so this is a label
that's been very abused. Uh,

1188
01:06:23,050 --> 01:06:27,510
my loads are organic. They're a hundred
percent donkeys, seaman, organic, chatty.

1189
01:06:27,610 --> 01:06:29,860
When you're broadcasting over there
on your channels, while you freak,

1190
01:06:33,050 --> 01:06:35,320
uh,
organic is,

1191
01:06:35,770 --> 01:06:38,260
it means a lot of things to a
lot of people been in general.

1192
01:06:38,261 --> 01:06:42,640
It's supposed to mean without or as
it's intended by a lot of people without

1193
01:06:42,670 --> 01:06:44,920
additional pesticides,
antibiotics, et Cetera,

1194
01:06:45,550 --> 01:06:49,420
as it would have been grown
102 hundred years ago. But, uh,

1195
01:06:51,870 --> 01:06:55,420
it's a, it's a, it's a battle for
dollars. So a lot of these labels,

1196
01:06:55,421 --> 01:06:56,950
if they're not regulated,
get misused.

1197
01:06:58,210 --> 01:07:02,770
And what is the feasibility of like,
say if you had a community of people,

1198
01:07:02,771 --> 01:07:06,150
say if you got together with a
10, 20 people, whatever, and you,

1199
01:07:06,151 --> 01:07:10,390
you all wanted to get in on some farm
land and figure out how to grow your own

1200
01:07:10,391 --> 01:07:13,630
vegetables. Have you like ever thought
about like how much land it takes,

1201
01:07:14,020 --> 01:07:16,950
how many animals you need,
how many looked at it super closely.

1202
01:07:17,060 --> 01:07:20,750
Is that in the book? It's a,
I talk about a lot of the,

1203
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:23,320
the survivalist and self-reliant stuff.

1204
01:07:23,610 --> 01:07:28,610
I don't talk about like homestead
homesteading or animal husbandry as much.

1205
01:07:28,990 --> 01:07:31,330
Um, I pretty much talks
about a weird way to put it.

1206
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:34,180
Homesteading and animal husbandry.
That's my next book.

1207
01:07:34,181 --> 01:07:37,710
Those are two strange terms that
you very rarely hear people use. No.

1208
01:07:37,711 --> 01:07:40,480
So I looked at this really close to
it in my, uh, my girlfriend actually,

1209
01:07:41,890 --> 01:07:43,150
she's from Vancouver,

1210
01:07:43,151 --> 01:07:47,680
Victoria and her family has created
in the last year of farm that produces

1211
01:07:47,681 --> 01:07:50,620
almost all of their foods.
So they have a handful of sheep.

1212
01:07:50,890 --> 01:07:55,890
They have a garden that's probably 150
by 150 feet and nothing produces so much

1213
01:07:56,650 --> 01:07:59,260
vegetation.
They have to give it away like,

1214
01:07:59,350 --> 01:08:02,890
and that's a family of four plus two dogs,

1215
01:08:02,891 --> 01:08:07,030
one 50 by one 50 feet and signing off.
It feels like it may be maybe 200 by 200,

1216
01:08:07,031 --> 01:08:12,031
but it is a very manageable amount of
acreage and it produces an astonishing

1217
01:08:13,541 --> 01:08:14,051
amount of food.

1218
01:08:14,051 --> 01:08:17,860
Now you have to know what you're
doing from a gardening standpoint.

1219
01:08:17,910 --> 01:08:21,500
I think raising animals and a lot of
ways it's a hundred times simpler than

1220
01:08:21,770 --> 01:08:26,100
keeping track of like 20 species and
keeping them alive of clients of plants,

1221
01:08:27,350 --> 01:08:30,230
they have more, they had
more, they use greenhouses.

1222
01:08:30,290 --> 01:08:33,650
They did have a greenhouse for certain
plants, like tomatoes for instance,

1223
01:08:33,980 --> 01:08:36,950
but outside just like
these huge stalks of Kale,

1224
01:08:36,980 --> 01:08:41,210
like four or five feet tall.
It amazing. I mean it's just,

1225
01:08:41,211 --> 01:08:42,420
it was so true.
It was the,

1226
01:08:42,620 --> 01:08:45,680
it was trippy for me in the same way
that going on my hunt was trippy where

1227
01:08:45,681 --> 01:08:49,190
you're like, wow, huh. So
that's what a, you know,

1228
01:08:49,430 --> 01:08:53,060
a Ribeye that's the part of the body
that are revise from a in the same way,

1229
01:08:53,061 --> 01:08:53,840
just seeing,
you know,

1230
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:57,950
Kale for the first time growing out of
the ground or asparagus or whatever.

1231
01:08:57,950 --> 01:09:02,270
It was really wild. How much effort would
it take to do that for like a family?

1232
01:09:02,590 --> 01:09:06,950
Like to run like it, to grow enough
food and to have it like it's, it's,

1233
01:09:07,060 --> 01:09:09,350
that's an interesting thing to think
about. How much land do you need?

1234
01:09:09,351 --> 01:09:11,690
How much water do you
need? You know, how much,

1235
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:16,190
how much acreage do you need for four
people? Five people can need much. I mean,

1236
01:09:16,191 --> 01:09:21,110
my uncle had a farm. I have two
uncles who had a one very small farm,

1237
01:09:21,111 --> 01:09:25,850
another with a much larger farm.
And uh, I mean if you have,

1238
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:29,540
you want chickens for
protein and not for the meat,

1239
01:09:29,541 --> 01:09:33,130
for the eggs because they give out eggs
every day. Just kicked those eggs out.

1240
01:09:33,131 --> 01:09:35,240
You know, I didn't even know
that till I was in my thirties.

1241
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:38,510
I'm so fucking stupid.
I thought that a,

1242
01:09:38,511 --> 01:09:42,180
every time a chicken gave an egg that
it could have been a baby chickie who

1243
01:09:42,190 --> 01:09:45,020
could have grown to be a baby.
Chicky but you ate it before it could.

1244
01:09:45,590 --> 01:09:48,350
That's what I really thought. I thought
like when you had fried eggs, the,

1245
01:09:48,351 --> 01:09:50,050
you were having baby chickies that just,

1246
01:09:50,051 --> 01:09:53,090
you caught him in time and you killed
them before they became little.

1247
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:57,380
But that's not what an egg is. Folks.
Chickens lay eggs every day. Yeah.

1248
01:09:57,590 --> 01:09:59,060
The ones that we make at least,

1249
01:09:59,180 --> 01:10:01,820
I don't know if it's normal in the
wild for them to run. They still,

1250
01:10:01,850 --> 01:10:03,710
they still do. There's
a lot of eggs. I mean,

1251
01:10:03,711 --> 01:10:06,860
they're not like Franken chickens where
they're like, breast meat is so big,

1252
01:10:06,861 --> 01:10:08,400
they can't stand up.
Right.

1253
01:10:08,420 --> 01:10:11,430
Like the freak ones that you see like
in those weird documentaries that scare

1254
01:10:11,431 --> 01:10:14,270
the shit out of here. Yeah.
There's a great, uh, there was, uh,

1255
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:17,900
there was a great TV
show or series in the UK,

1256
01:10:17,901 --> 01:10:22,880
I think it was BBC produced called,
I think it was escaped to river cottage.

1257
01:10:22,970 --> 01:10:26,480
And it was about a chef from London
who decided to go to the country and

1258
01:10:26,481 --> 01:10:29,600
basically try to do all
this stuff from ground zero.

1259
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:34,230
So raising animals, raising all of his
food on this property. And it goes,

1260
01:10:34,231 --> 01:10:37,640
you remember the guy's
name? Uh, should know this.

1261
01:10:37,641 --> 01:10:42,260
He wrote the river cottage cookbook and
as well as a river cottage meet book,

1262
01:10:42,261 --> 01:10:45,470
which is the same guy that
bought Dane had on his show,

1263
01:10:45,710 --> 01:10:50,000
got longish hair glasses. Maybe,
uh, you know, the show's over now.

1264
01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:53,480
He's got a new one on CNN now. Oh,
really? Yeah, they moved it over to CNN.

1265
01:10:54,260 --> 01:10:56,740
That's what, uh, the,
uh, one of the guys, Moe,

1266
01:10:56,750 --> 01:11:00,370
who's the director of a meat eater is
also one of the guys who works for a port

1267
01:11:00,380 --> 01:11:02,630
Dane. He works for both. That's
right. That's right. 0.0. Yeah.

1268
01:11:02,740 --> 01:11:05,600
So I remember it's Hugh
fairly weddings hall,

1269
01:11:05,601 --> 01:11:08,870
some very British sounding
aristocratic name that's very British.

1270
01:11:08,871 --> 01:11:11,630
So clearly winning his hall,
something like that.

1271
01:11:11,631 --> 01:11:14,250
But the show is awesome and it goes
through a lot of this stuff. Shows

1272
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:17,160
him fucking it up and getting it
right, which is really cool. Yeah.

1273
01:11:17,161 --> 01:11:21,530
I would imagine it would take some effort
and planning for sure. Yeah. But I mean,

1274
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:26,160
Brian Cowen and I who, uh, Walsall went
on the hunt with me, with Steve Rinella.

1275
01:11:26,190 --> 01:11:30,540
We've talked many times about getting
a plot of land for our family and like

1276
01:11:30,541 --> 01:11:34,110
figuring out how to do
something like that. It will
require a lot of work though.

1277
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:37,110
I eat. It would, and it's
probably a good idea.

1278
01:11:37,140 --> 01:11:39,660
Part of what I thought about
when I was, uh, you know,

1279
01:11:39,830 --> 01:11:43,530
doing all this research over the last
fuck two years since we last saw each

1280
01:11:43,531 --> 01:11:47,220
other, whatever is creating a, a,

1281
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:50,940
a small group of like
modern hunter gatherers.

1282
01:11:50,970 --> 01:11:53,220
So you have five friends and instead
of trying to do it all yourself,

1283
01:11:53,221 --> 01:11:56,460
you're like, all right, you're in charge
of Caribou. Go get us some Caribou.

1284
01:11:56,790 --> 01:12:00,330
You're in charge of fucking tomatoes,
tomato guy.

1285
01:12:00,331 --> 01:12:02,250
Make sure you get the
tomatoes you're in charge of.

1286
01:12:02,850 --> 01:12:07,810
Who the fuck knows Kombucha you made, that
would be a great thing to make. Uh, uh,

1287
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:11,970
isn't it crazy though that that
might be a rat reality some day?

1288
01:12:12,210 --> 01:12:17,100
It's impossible for people to imagine
anything bigger than sandy or Katrina.

1289
01:12:17,130 --> 01:12:20,490
Katrina was bigger than Sandy. Yeah,
but something along those lines.

1290
01:12:20,491 --> 01:12:23,850
So a massive disaster.
Massive loss of property and life.

1291
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:27,870
But that's nothing compared
to like what used to be here.

1292
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:31,470
Just the ice that used to be over
North America just to, you know,

1293
01:12:31,830 --> 01:12:36,830
some guy we're in Canada
and he was talking about how
they found beaver can just

1294
01:12:37,051 --> 01:12:38,360
brought it up.
Someone was talking about growth,

1295
01:12:38,490 --> 01:12:43,490
global warming and he was saying how
they found beaver dense like a under

1296
01:12:44,010 --> 01:12:47,380
hundreds of feet of ice in Greenland
and that at one point in time that I saw

1297
01:12:47,381 --> 01:12:50,490
wasn't there. You know, this is
like real simples real recent.

1298
01:12:50,730 --> 01:12:55,730
Some shit happened and we cling
to the idea of staying in a spot.

1299
01:12:56,940 --> 01:13:00,030
We claim to the idea, this is
my land. I've sticked to claim.

1300
01:13:00,031 --> 01:13:02,550
Well I have a property line.
I even have a fence up.

1301
01:13:02,970 --> 01:13:07,230
But that's ridiculous because this
earth is a constantly shifting organism.

1302
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:11,790
You know, it's a, it's a thing and
it moves around and things change.

1303
01:13:11,791 --> 01:13:14,580
The atmosphere changes. Yeah.
They used to be dinosaurs here.

1304
01:13:14,581 --> 01:13:17,630
Stupid Shit.

1305
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:22,050
That shit is a Volvo volatile, you
know, and we don't want to believe that.

1306
01:13:22,051 --> 01:13:22,980
We want to believe that,
oh,

1307
01:13:22,981 --> 01:13:27,830
I shut my little cardboard door and the
co La Loche my little brass lock and I'm

1308
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:31,890
in, I am completely shut off
from the environment. You know,

1309
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:34,860
it's just having,
fuck,

1310
01:13:34,861 --> 01:13:38,790
I mean people like spend
three hours on a Saturday,

1311
01:13:39,390 --> 01:13:41,430
spend a few hundred bucks,
go get,

1312
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:46,460
go to Costco because they have all this
disaster preparedness stuff and get two

1313
01:13:47,311 --> 01:13:51,840
weeks of food, get like a week
or two a water. Just have it.

1314
01:13:51,930 --> 01:13:54,360
What's the downside?
It's definitely not a bad thing to have.

1315
01:13:54,361 --> 01:13:58,620
It's definitely not a bad
thing to be prepared. Um, if
you could do solar power, I,

1316
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:03,640
I definitely want to try to do that.
And a lot of people go with, um, uh,

1317
01:14:03,810 --> 01:14:06,450
they have, um, they have both.

1318
01:14:06,451 --> 01:14:09,480
They have like a generator or they'll
have like solar power. They have propane,

1319
01:14:09,481 --> 01:14:12,310
you can have like propane
generators that will kick on

1320
01:14:12,460 --> 01:14:14,830
that we'll kick on automatically
when your power goes out.

1321
01:14:14,831 --> 01:14:17,590
I had that in Colorado because
when I was living in the mountains,

1322
01:14:17,591 --> 01:14:18,251
apparently the power,

1323
01:14:18,251 --> 01:14:20,770
the power goes out up there all the time
and sometimes it takes a long time for

1324
01:14:20,771 --> 01:14:23,320
them to turn it back on.
So as soon as the power would go on,

1325
01:14:23,321 --> 01:14:27,190
you would hear like a second and then
you hear the generator kick on is a big

1326
01:14:27,191 --> 01:14:29,800
ass generator that was
set up for this property.

1327
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:33,670
But I'm windmills.
That's another option.

1328
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:37,990
I have my friend and Oregon has windmills
and he actually sells power back to

1329
01:14:37,991 --> 01:14:41,050
the grid. However, the fuck
that works. How does that work?

1330
01:14:41,580 --> 01:14:46,290
Uh, well yeah, I mean they will
meet her, goes the opposite way.

1331
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:49,350
That's crazy. They don't get
you a credit. That's what, uh,

1332
01:14:49,410 --> 01:14:54,060
that's what some actually many schools
in California and elsewhere are doing to

1333
01:14:54,270 --> 01:14:57,670
generate extra revenue.
Is there actually, uh,

1334
01:14:58,290 --> 01:15:01,110
having solar power companies
that are partnered with,

1335
01:15:01,111 --> 01:15:05,490
whether it's different power companies
that were local government will install

1336
01:15:05,491 --> 01:15:08,940
solar panels on the top of
all the gymnasiums and all
the school buildings and

1337
01:15:08,941 --> 01:15:09,774
everything like that.

1338
01:15:10,550 --> 01:15:14,880
And then they will receive either an
upfront payment or some type of monthly

1339
01:15:15,090 --> 01:15:19,410
stipend or they get a percentage of the
energy that is paid that is then sold

1340
01:15:19,411 --> 01:15:20,830
back to the grid basically.
Yeah.

1341
01:15:20,900 --> 01:15:25,130
Yeah. There was a school, uh, in boulder
that had like a whole farm set up there.

1342
01:15:25,131 --> 01:15:28,610
It was pretty bad ass kids were growing
their own food at school. I was like,

1343
01:15:28,611 --> 01:15:32,480
yeah, that, that'd be a really smart
thing to teach kids how to do, you know,

1344
01:15:32,481 --> 01:15:36,510
instead you're teaching them some shit
there. Almost likely to never use yeah.

1345
01:15:36,810 --> 01:15:39,320
You know,
teach them how to actually grow some food.

1346
01:15:39,321 --> 01:15:40,850
That would be a great thing to teach.

1347
01:15:40,851 --> 01:15:45,680
Like as a standard class in high school
farming to search simple farming.

1348
01:15:45,710 --> 01:15:50,390
This is, hey, grow vegetables. That's
why isn't that like a or a requirement?

1349
01:15:50,570 --> 01:15:53,420
Math is acquiring English as a
requirement. We were like, listen,

1350
01:15:53,421 --> 01:15:56,300
we've got the natural world lockdown.
Okay,

1351
01:15:56,330 --> 01:15:59,300
we don't have to think about
that anymore. But that, that law,

1352
01:15:59,330 --> 01:16:03,590
that lost connection, you really
do feel this, uh, this connection.

1353
01:16:03,591 --> 01:16:06,290
When you grow something, when you
actually grow something and then eat it,

1354
01:16:06,530 --> 01:16:10,880
it's like it awakened something inside
you. This weird primal satisfaction.

1355
01:16:11,210 --> 01:16:12,010
And also just the,

1356
01:16:12,010 --> 01:16:16,270
the therapeutic aspect of having to care
for something besides yourself I think

1357
01:16:16,290 --> 01:16:20,680
is really, I certainly underestimated
it. I mean, I kill plants.

1358
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:25,800
Like it's my job. I just,
I, I have a brown thumb or I
don't pay attention. Oh care,

1359
01:16:25,810 --> 01:16:27,680
whatever it is.
But I,

1360
01:16:27,790 --> 01:16:32,410
I ended up experimenting again with
growing plants and I just got rosemary,

1361
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:33,970
it's a really tough planet,

1362
01:16:34,990 --> 01:16:37,900
pretty hard to kill and you can use
it for just about any type of food.

1363
01:16:37,901 --> 01:16:39,970
So I started with just
a little rosemary plant,

1364
01:16:40,450 --> 01:16:43,330
like cut to kind of look like a fucking
Christmas tree that I got a whole foods

1365
01:16:43,331 --> 01:16:46,660
or something.
And that thing will produce enough herbs,

1366
01:16:47,020 --> 01:16:51,190
enough herbs for tea and herbs for
food for like weeks and weeks on end.

1367
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:53,020
And it's hard to kill.
So I thought,

1368
01:16:53,021 --> 01:16:58,021
I found that to be a really low stakes
way to have an early success with growing

1369
01:16:58,271 --> 01:17:01,840
a plant that would hopefully then
encourage you to do more of it because it

1370
01:17:01,841 --> 01:17:04,660
sucks when you try to get into something
like that and then immediately fail

1371
01:17:04,661 --> 01:17:06,640
because everything dies
and you're like, ah, yeah,

1372
01:17:06,950 --> 01:17:11,270
don't want to jump right into the deep
end of pool and learn how to grow a plant.

1373
01:17:11,390 --> 01:17:15,260
Right. For thinking about starting a
farm. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, exactly.

1374
01:17:16,180 --> 01:17:19,380
Geez. If you have like your
everyday life and then on the side,

1375
01:17:19,381 --> 01:17:21,950
do you want to run a farm? Like,
bitch, you ain't got time for that.

1376
01:17:22,530 --> 01:17:25,420
You get the full, the full timers have
enough trouble with that, like, yeah,

1377
01:17:25,430 --> 01:17:27,290
I mean you would,
you would have to,

1378
01:17:27,470 --> 01:17:30,980
if you were going to feed yourself
completely with the animals in the food,

1379
01:17:31,010 --> 01:17:33,680
that would require a tremendous
amount of work. You know, the,

1380
01:17:33,681 --> 01:17:37,430
the people that sell vegetables and
actually run a farmer at dairy farm or

1381
01:17:37,431 --> 01:17:40,610
something along those lines,
that's an incredible amount of work.

1382
01:17:40,620 --> 01:17:44,060
People who actually know folks
that actually have a family farm.

1383
01:17:44,390 --> 01:17:47,120
That's an incredible amount
of work that's even more.

1384
01:17:47,390 --> 01:17:49,520
But to just to feed
yourself and your family,

1385
01:17:49,820 --> 01:17:53,720
it's going to require several hours
every day, many hours every day.

1386
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:59,840
Taking care of the animals, feeding them,
cleaning up animals. Definitely. Yeah.

1387
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:01,580
Dealing with,
you know,

1388
01:18:01,610 --> 01:18:05,600
setting up whatever the fuck you have
around your vegetables with its fences

1389
01:18:05,860 --> 01:18:09,700
that are keeping your irrigation
going and keeping him watering, gone,

1390
01:18:09,750 --> 01:18:13,820
dealing with fucking pestos little fucking
things that start eating your food.

1391
01:18:15,210 --> 01:18:19,080
You can, uh, you can actually purchase
a pretty cool, uh, think they're,

1392
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:22,200
think they're hydroponic.
I might be using the wrong word

1393
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:24,900
hanging gardens.

1394
01:18:25,380 --> 01:18:28,850
So they have these plastic containers
that hold the various plants and it

1395
01:18:28,860 --> 01:18:32,250
actually hangs down the side of a door,
almost like a shoe holder.

1396
01:18:32,940 --> 01:18:36,030
And then there's an
automated water system, uh,

1397
01:18:36,090 --> 01:18:39,090
that you can time so you can leave
and go away for a day or two.

1398
01:18:39,091 --> 01:18:43,170
And it just grows these plants effectively
vertically, which is super, super cool.

1399
01:18:43,410 --> 01:18:45,450
And then they get to a certain size.
You have to plant them,

1400
01:18:45,810 --> 01:18:47,880
get to a certain size and
you can eat them. Really,

1401
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:51,090
you don't even need to plant them.
That's super cool.

1402
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:54,750
Do they run on a power like we're going
to power is, yeah. You would plug in.

1403
01:18:55,290 --> 01:18:59,130
If you have the time than
automated watering system,
then you'd plug it in. See,

1404
01:18:59,131 --> 01:19:02,130
that seems to me like it's
at least slightly defeating
the whole purpose of the

1405
01:19:02,131 --> 01:19:05,800
whole thing. If you need the fucking
electricity to be on. All right. Yeah.

1406
01:19:05,980 --> 01:19:09,720
Think this is more for the aesthetic
of having plants on your door. Yeah.

1407
01:19:09,721 --> 01:19:12,180
Well it's pretty dope if you power on,

1408
01:19:12,210 --> 01:19:14,970
but if you don't keep the power and then
all that means is you have to water the

1409
01:19:14,971 --> 01:19:17,760
plants, which means you better
have some goddamn water. If, uh,

1410
01:19:17,780 --> 01:19:22,440
if your water system, if you, if your
municipal water goes out, no shit man.

1411
01:19:22,441 --> 01:19:27,120
You have to have it like a well system
or just go by, I mean, for instance,

1412
01:19:27,630 --> 01:19:30,000
in the basement of my
apartment right now I have,

1413
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:33,300
I don't know what it was like 40
gallons of water. Don't tell people do.

1414
01:19:33,330 --> 01:19:37,440
They'll come look and I five guns.
Shoot, shoot him for your water. Wow.

1415
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:39,780
Tim Fellows,
first murder starts to guy.

1416
01:19:40,410 --> 01:19:43,710
I have like seven of those
arrowhead water thing. If people,

1417
01:19:43,740 --> 01:19:47,790
if after three days of no water, people
will start looking for water. Oh yeah.

1418
01:19:47,791 --> 01:19:50,640
It's not like I'm saying I expect that,
but here's the thing,

1419
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:54,930
I like target practice. I have
ranges near my house. It's fun to do.

1420
01:19:55,230 --> 01:20:00,230
Having a firearm is worst case scenario
insurance in a location where a seven

1421
01:20:01,231 --> 01:20:05,190
point or higher Richter scale earthquake
is 80 plus percent probable in the next

1422
01:20:05,191 --> 01:20:06,960
15 years.
Is that real?

1423
01:20:07,020 --> 01:20:11,700
80% so seven 70% plus a few years ago,

1424
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:14,940
and I think that has since gone up
because on the ring of fire we had Japan,

1425
01:20:15,010 --> 01:20:17,760
New Zealand,
and I think the odds just improved.

1426
01:20:17,970 --> 01:20:22,970
What's the deal with those dudes who
find wells with a divining rod down?

1427
01:20:24,610 --> 01:20:27,810
What's called, yeah, yeah, yeah. What's a
divining rod then? What the Hell's that?

1428
01:20:28,380 --> 01:20:31,040
Defining Rod,
I believe is where it's,

1429
01:20:31,050 --> 01:20:35,020
you hold onto the fork of a stick
that looks almost like a slingshot.

1430
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:38,160
So you hold onto the top of either end
of the why and then you're supposed to

1431
01:20:38,161 --> 01:20:41,130
get you supposed to get
steered by the end of it. Oh,

1432
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:46,170
it's so dowsing is the use of a divining
Rod. That's what I believe. So, yeah.

1433
01:20:46,171 --> 01:20:47,190
And there's an also,

1434
01:20:47,220 --> 01:20:50,580
there's another method where they have
two sticks that are shaped like Ellis and

1435
01:20:50,581 --> 01:20:53,730
they hold them in either hand upside
down and then when they cross that's

1436
01:20:53,731 --> 01:20:56,640
supposed to indicate how the fuck
could that be real? I don't know.

1437
01:20:57,320 --> 01:21:00,180
It's like that game where you played
like you're with card Mani. No.

1438
01:21:00,181 --> 01:21:04,800
Where you have your, the spirits
where you're bored. So I will,

1439
01:21:04,801 --> 01:21:05,640
I will say this much.

1440
01:21:05,670 --> 01:21:10,500
I do think there are things like that
that are not unexplainable but are yet to

1441
01:21:10,501 --> 01:21:12,190
have been explained.
And uh,

1442
01:21:12,630 --> 01:21:17,250
I say that partially because I've seen
some pretty weird shit even at a lot of

1443
01:21:17,251 --> 01:21:20,760
people don't realize this at
Princeton University before.

1444
01:21:22,310 --> 01:21:23,970
I think this ended 2000 2001,

1445
01:21:23,971 --> 01:21:26,160
but one of the reasons I went there
as an Undergrad is because they had

1446
01:21:26,161 --> 01:21:28,440
something called the scientific
anomalies laboratory.

1447
01:21:29,010 --> 01:21:32,380
And this is where among
other organizations,

1448
01:21:32,910 --> 01:21:37,910
several branches of the military
funded research into things like remote

1449
01:21:38,041 --> 01:21:41,870
viewing, which is basically scientifically
controlled clairvoyants where you have

1450
01:21:42,060 --> 01:21:46,380
transmitter and a receiver and they use
like double blind protocols to see if it

1451
01:21:46,381 --> 01:21:50,700
is possible to report images back from
one location, from one person to another.

1452
01:21:51,330 --> 01:21:53,220
And uh,
they had some.

1453
01:21:54,980 --> 01:21:58,310
And then to validate whatever, uh, or to,

1454
01:21:58,390 --> 01:22:00,690
to design the studies and
then analyze the data.

1455
01:22:01,050 --> 01:22:05,010
They had some of the world's top
mathematicians and statisticians, uh,

1456
01:22:05,370 --> 01:22:09,360
supervising this stuff.
And Professor John J, O,

1457
01:22:09,390 --> 01:22:13,800
h n who ran, I believe that was
his name, who ran this laboratory.

1458
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:16,510
And I went down and I was a test subject.
I didn't have any x men like power,

1459
01:22:16,511 --> 01:22:20,100
sadly, um, who supervise this,

1460
01:22:20,101 --> 01:22:25,101
did this closing presentation when the
lab was being wound down due to lack of

1461
01:22:25,291 --> 01:22:29,640
funding. And he presented some of
his findings and he basically said,

1462
01:22:29,641 --> 01:22:32,880
if you look at the statistics,
like all of this stuff has been validated,

1463
01:22:33,480 --> 01:22:37,930
but it will never be accepted
because of a, B, and c. And, um,

1464
01:22:38,130 --> 01:22:41,010
what was really trippy about
the remote viewing, right?

1465
01:22:41,011 --> 01:22:43,500
So in the remote viewing protocol,
one of them,

1466
01:22:44,370 --> 01:22:46,320
they would have let's say
three or four envelopes.

1467
01:22:46,380 --> 01:22:48,750
The transmitter would choose one,
they would leave,

1468
01:22:48,751 --> 01:22:52,830
get into a car with the
supervisors, uh, the experimenters,

1469
01:22:53,340 --> 01:22:57,960
and then open the envelope, find gps
coordinates and go to that location.

1470
01:22:58,080 --> 01:22:59,730
And that's where they would transmit from.

1471
01:22:59,790 --> 01:23:02,580
And what they found was
for one of the locations,

1472
01:23:03,330 --> 01:23:05,100
the drawings that came
back and they were better,

1473
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:08,340
some people were better at
receiving than others. Uh,

1474
01:23:08,350 --> 01:23:10,450
the drawings all looked very,
very similar,

1475
01:23:10,451 --> 01:23:12,910
but they didn't resemble the gas
station where people were going.

1476
01:23:13,420 --> 01:23:16,840
And then they did research on the
location and they found out that they were

1477
01:23:16,841 --> 01:23:21,700
drawing barracks that had been there
like a 120 years earlier. Whoa.

1478
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:24,970
Trippy. Really, really,
really trippy shit. So,

1479
01:23:25,460 --> 01:23:26,293
I don't know,

1480
01:23:26,750 --> 01:23:31,750
like say if you wanted to set up an
experiment today with a remote viewing,

1481
01:23:32,180 --> 01:23:35,410
are there experts that you would
go to that are, that are the,

1482
01:23:35,420 --> 01:23:38,510
that are the bad motherfuckers are remote
viewing that you really think could

1483
01:23:38,540 --> 01:23:42,800
replicate something scientifically like
for a television show or something like

1484
01:23:42,801 --> 01:23:43,910
that if they were under the gun?

1485
01:23:44,860 --> 01:23:46,650
That's a good question.
I don't know. I think,

1486
01:23:46,690 --> 01:23:51,690
I honestly think that these types of
abilities are at some point going to be as

1487
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:58,200
analyzable is like shooting three pointers
or looking at the top of UFC fighters

1488
01:23:58,631 --> 01:23:59,441
and like,
okay,

1489
01:23:59,441 --> 01:24:02,710
we're going to look at the
fiber composition of like
a GSP and Anderson silver.

1490
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:04,570
I think at some point's gonna be like,
oh,

1491
01:24:04,900 --> 01:24:08,980
like Johnny's really good
at remote viewing because
he has the blah, blah, blah.

1492
01:24:08,981 --> 01:24:12,160
And his like substantial. Yeah.
He's got like some fucking,

1493
01:24:12,161 --> 01:24:14,860
the th three 74 gene is
turned on. Oh, of course.

1494
01:24:15,310 --> 01:24:19,030
And so there are some people who appear
to be better than this than others,

1495
01:24:19,031 --> 01:24:23,330
but just to touch on like
the weegee board and uh, uh,

1496
01:24:23,620 --> 01:24:27,250
fucking Taro cards and all that shit.
I think that there,

1497
01:24:27,910 --> 01:24:30,520
I don't place any power
in the tools themselves.

1498
01:24:30,521 --> 01:24:35,080
I think there are people
who have abilities who then
use those tools to explain

1499
01:24:35,110 --> 01:24:39,910
their abilities. It is an
outlet for their abilities. Uh,

1500
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,980
I've just seen way too much weird shit,
man.

1501
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:46,010
What have you seen that's verifiable?
What have you seen? Nothing.

1502
01:24:47,090 --> 01:24:47,923
No, no, I know,

1503
01:24:48,460 --> 01:24:53,020
but like the want this to all be real
verifiable stuff I would say is look at

1504
01:24:53,021 --> 01:24:54,460
research that's been done by,

1505
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:57,970
I think it's Sarnoff international there
bunch of defense contractors who have

1506
01:24:57,971 --> 01:25:02,620
funded this kind of
stuff. And uh, also, uh,

1507
01:25:02,830 --> 01:25:06,190
look at the, uh, try to
find stuff on the, um,

1508
01:25:06,610 --> 01:25:08,050
scientific anomalies laboratory.

1509
01:25:08,170 --> 01:25:11,710
Should I watch the men who stare at goats?
I, you know, I've wanted to see that.

1510
01:25:11,711 --> 01:25:14,250
I haven't seen it. I would see
it anyway. It sounds great.

1511
01:25:14,260 --> 01:25:16,690
It was very face it a Cohen
brothers, is it Cohen brothers? Yeah,

1512
01:25:16,870 --> 01:25:18,870
I've heard it's very funny.
Clooney, right? Yeah. Yeah,

1513
01:25:19,150 --> 01:25:21,610
I've heard it's very funny actually.
I can't believe I haven't seen it now.

1514
01:25:21,850 --> 01:25:23,870
Now that I think about it.
Um,

1515
01:25:23,950 --> 01:25:28,240
so there's nothing that you can like
no studies that you can point to that

1516
01:25:28,241 --> 01:25:29,410
definitively have proven it,

1517
01:25:29,411 --> 01:25:33,760
but you do you mean that it's
possible or are you a believer?

1518
01:25:34,210 --> 01:25:37,460
No, no, no. I'm not operating on
faith. I think that if you like

1519
01:25:37,530 --> 01:25:41,230
nice and what I meant, I mean you've
seen enough that you believe enough

1520
01:25:41,390 --> 01:25:43,700
that I what I'm comfortable saying,

1521
01:25:43,701 --> 01:25:46,580
it's not that like telekinesis
exists or this exists,

1522
01:25:46,581 --> 01:25:51,581
but there are odd phenomena that
I have seen that that's how,

1523
01:25:52,610 --> 01:25:57,610
I mean I don't think science has a limit
sciences and method of thinking and a

1524
01:25:57,621 --> 01:25:59,300
method of testing hypotheses.

1525
01:25:59,940 --> 01:26:01,860
The method of measuring
and a method of measuring.

1526
01:26:01,861 --> 01:26:04,070
I think that with some unique is you can't

1527
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:06,950
really measure them if they don't happen
again. If they're unique. Right, exactly.

1528
01:26:06,951 --> 01:26:09,140
So they have to be good
sciences replicable. Right.

1529
01:26:09,320 --> 01:26:14,320
And I do believe that there are enough
demonstrations of like measurements of

1530
01:26:14,900 --> 01:26:18,110
metrics that should correlate like Ci,
right?

1531
01:26:18,111 --> 01:26:20,850
Like energy that's emitted from
poems by people in China and shit.

1532
01:26:20,851 --> 01:26:23,180
There've been a lot of studies
like mailing stuff where they say,

1533
01:26:23,900 --> 01:26:27,360
well the they have, I don't know
what they measure, photons I,

1534
01:26:27,361 --> 01:26:30,380
it's probably not futons heat from
a distance. I don't know what it is.

1535
01:26:30,381 --> 01:26:35,381
But like I've seen enough stuff that I
think many of these anomalies that are

1536
01:26:36,621 --> 01:26:38,300
seen as like a super powers,

1537
01:26:38,301 --> 01:26:42,560
they're not super powers is they're
manifestations of some type of biological,

1538
01:26:43,190 --> 01:26:47,900
a variable that will be
explainable at some point in time.

1539
01:26:47,901 --> 01:26:50,330
And I'm not saying all of them exists,
but like I've seen,

1540
01:26:51,140 --> 01:26:53,780
and again this is going to sound like
it's straight out of Crackville but it's

1541
01:26:53,781 --> 01:26:57,410
stuff that I fucking scene is like
I lived in China for six months,

1542
01:26:57,470 --> 01:27:02,470
I was an exchange student there and saw
this like you know Chigong master from

1543
01:27:03,390 --> 01:27:07,190
a, and I think a lot of that's pure
bullshit and just like cultish behavior,

1544
01:27:07,191 --> 01:27:08,870
but it's particularly guy,
old guy.

1545
01:27:08,870 --> 01:27:12,350
And he was sitting there in a park and
he was doing his exercise and shit and he

1546
01:27:12,351 --> 01:27:15,290
had dry leaves in between his hands and
that he was just like kind of shuffling

1547
01:27:15,291 --> 01:27:18,230
them back and forth between his hands.
The weirdest,

1548
01:27:18,231 --> 01:27:21,020
like one of the weirdest things I've
ever seen was that it wasn't a con,

1549
01:27:21,050 --> 01:27:24,050
I don't know. You mean they
were like flying through
the air, but they were like,

1550
01:27:24,051 --> 01:27:28,310
she was sliding across this tabletop
in the park between his hands.

1551
01:27:28,311 --> 01:27:32,900
His hands are like 18 inches apart.
And I mean,

1552
01:27:32,930 --> 01:27:35,420
I don't have any explanation for it,
but I know what I saw.

1553
01:27:35,480 --> 01:27:39,800
So it's not like I'm a proponent,
I'm not on the, you know, the, uh,

1554
01:27:40,810 --> 01:27:44,480
our, uh, lobby or anything. It's just you
find that guy and get a video of that,

1555
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:49,040
that seems like simple. Okay, dude. Yeah,
you can get white leaf thing. Well, there,

1556
01:27:49,041 --> 01:27:53,300
there are videos of all sorts of weird
shit and most of it's bs. But anyway, I,

1557
01:27:53,301 --> 01:27:57,660
you saw a guy really do it. They believe
that God can really do that with, well,

1558
01:27:58,200 --> 01:28:00,500
I, I know what I saw. And to me, I mean,

1559
01:28:02,790 --> 01:28:05,770
that's just that one. I know.
And here's the thing, right?

1560
01:28:05,771 --> 01:28:08,480
Like there's some really brilliant
ways to con, so it's like,

1561
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:11,810
that could have been a con God knows that
China's full cons. I mean it was like,

1562
01:28:11,970 --> 01:28:14,390
Oh yeah, oh sure. I mean
if you're in Beijing,

1563
01:28:14,391 --> 01:28:17,660
like you'll have art students come up
to you like every 10 minutes to sell you

1564
01:28:17,661 --> 01:28:20,510
their unique pieces of artwork and
they're poor and they could really bubble

1565
01:28:20,511 --> 01:28:24,830
lights, horn. No, no, no
artwork. Poor said their porn.

1566
01:28:24,831 --> 01:28:27,630
I'm going out there selling you their
porn in Beijing. Them No, no, it's good.

1567
01:28:27,650 --> 01:28:30,260
They're poor. I mean, there are tons
of scams and China, so who knows.

1568
01:28:30,261 --> 01:28:31,680
But what I would say is,
you know,

1569
01:28:31,690 --> 01:28:34,010
in the research for let's
say the four hour chef,

1570
01:28:34,011 --> 01:28:36,710
because it's kind of a book on learning.
It's a book on accelerated learning,

1571
01:28:36,711 --> 01:28:37,544
not just on food,

1572
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:41,060
but I met people who could memorize a
shuffled deck of cards in like 43 seconds.

1573
01:28:41,061 --> 01:28:41,750
Right?

1574
01:28:41,750 --> 01:28:46,280
Or somebody you can learn a language like
Icelandic well enough in seven days to

1575
01:28:46,281 --> 01:28:50,730
go on TV and be interviewed. So to me,
if that is within their own possibility,

1576
01:28:50,731 --> 01:28:53,060
remember I was like training
yourself to memorize 10,000 numbers.

1577
01:28:53,530 --> 01:28:58,530
Like moving something like moving at
least two in your hands is not like beyond

1578
01:28:58,971 --> 01:29:02,640
belief. For me it's just, it's, I, I,

1579
01:29:02,970 --> 01:29:06,940
I don't see any reason why it
should be impossible. I don't know.

1580
01:29:07,850 --> 01:29:08,041
The,

1581
01:29:08,041 --> 01:29:11,520
you'd be able to push some energy from
your hand that would make light things

1582
01:29:11,521 --> 01:29:14,820
move back and forth. Very, very sure.
I mean, I don't, I haven't, again,

1583
01:29:14,821 --> 01:29:15,280
it's like there,

1584
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:19,890
there's been no physiological evidence
to demonstrate that is possible up to

1585
01:29:19,891 --> 01:29:23,310
this point. But there are lots of
things that seem impossible that, that,

1586
01:29:23,311 --> 01:29:27,720
that had been certainly observed.
Whether it's through looking at, uh,

1587
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:32,430
like theoretical physics or looking
at applied physics for that matter.

1588
01:29:32,431 --> 01:29:36,120
I mean there are plenty of things that
were thought impossible that are just not.

1589
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:40,750
Um,
so you think that it's you or,

1590
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:41,790
or rather you,

1591
01:29:41,970 --> 01:29:46,020
you believe that there has been studies
that have shown that people can generate

1592
01:29:46,021 --> 01:29:49,530
certain amounts of energy
with their hands. What styles
there? No, no, no. I like,

1593
01:29:49,560 --> 01:29:52,440
I'm not saying any of this stuff
and measurable, Measurable.

1594
01:29:52,770 --> 01:29:56,350
There have been studies done in
China and elsewhere looking at she,

1595
01:29:56,351 --> 01:29:59,130
so the potential measurement of cheese
specifically, how would they do that?

1596
01:29:59,131 --> 01:30:02,280
And I remember, I don't know
the exact tools are using
for measurement. And again,

1597
01:30:02,281 --> 01:30:06,610
I'm not saying like I am
standing for, I know. No,

1598
01:30:06,640 --> 01:30:09,180
I know what you're saying. You're
saying there are people world's weird,

1599
01:30:09,210 --> 01:30:13,830
the weirdest world and the problem
in this world. I said, yeah,

1600
01:30:13,860 --> 01:30:17,490
this is nice. I wonder what's in
my way. I need some adapalene.

1601
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:20,820
I need some pro vigil. Um, the uh,

1602
01:30:23,130 --> 01:30:26,580
what did I say? The weird his world.
Yeah, the word is, we're weird.

1603
01:30:26,581 --> 01:30:28,900
His world world is weird. That's
what I'm saying. You're not, you're,

1604
01:30:28,901 --> 01:30:30,840
you're not saying
necessarily that you believe,

1605
01:30:30,841 --> 01:30:33,990
you're saying that there's so
much weird shit that is real,

1606
01:30:34,140 --> 01:30:37,590
that you leave open the possibility
that a guy could have some strange

1607
01:30:37,620 --> 01:30:41,010
telekinetic control over matter
for instance. I mean I'm a,

1608
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:46,520
you need for something to
be scientifically verified
with let's say statistical

1609
01:30:47,670 --> 01:30:48,331
validity,

1610
01:30:48,331 --> 01:30:52,050
whether it's through this
number of subjects that a
number of n or you just have

1611
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:53,900
such a magnitude of change that like the,

1612
01:30:53,901 --> 01:30:58,850
the p value mean the probability of it
being random event is less than 5%. Uh,

1613
01:30:58,980 --> 01:31:01,050
to do that you need tools for measurement.

1614
01:31:01,260 --> 01:31:05,760
And it's naive to think that we have
created all the tools for measuring all

1615
01:31:05,761 --> 01:31:08,190
things we haven't. Right? Right.
That's why, that's why for instance,

1616
01:31:08,191 --> 01:31:11,940
people try to isolate
nutrients, get themselves into
trouble because they'll say,

1617
01:31:11,941 --> 01:31:14,940
okay, Beta carotenes good for you.
This is true like 15 years ago.

1618
01:31:14,941 --> 01:31:17,130
And then people use a ton of Beta
carotene. They get sick. Why?

1619
01:31:17,131 --> 01:31:18,090
Because they're not consuming.

1620
01:31:18,091 --> 01:31:22,810
It would naturally current cofactors
that they couldn't isolate and see.

1621
01:31:22,811 --> 01:31:26,980
You have to be science among other
things is a game of measurement.

1622
01:31:26,981 --> 01:31:29,840
So I think that as the tools
get better. For instance, uh,

1623
01:31:30,090 --> 01:31:34,710
right now I'm actually involved with
and partially funding studies at a Ucla

1624
01:31:35,070 --> 01:31:39,090
University of California at San Francisco
in their neuroimaging lab where for

1625
01:31:39,091 --> 01:31:43,380
the first time they're able to do a couple
of very interesting things like take

1626
01:31:43,381 --> 01:31:48,381
a functional Mri machine and use it in
the same room at the same time as an Eeg,

1627
01:31:48,900 --> 01:31:51,900
which is actually a really tough problem
because these fucking magnets will like,

1628
01:31:51,960 --> 01:31:55,050
you know, pull shrapnel out of your skull.
I mean they're really strong magnets.

1629
01:31:55,051 --> 01:31:57,050
You have to be careful and they're,

1630
01:31:57,051 --> 01:32:02,051
they're able now using like even retail
products like the connect and whatnot to

1631
01:32:03,641 --> 01:32:08,641
look at how you can reverse
symptoms of dementia potentially.

1632
01:32:08,681 --> 01:32:13,240
Like how do you train someone's brain
to go from resembling that of a 60 year

1633
01:32:13,241 --> 01:32:14,920
old to that of a 20 year old.

1634
01:32:15,310 --> 01:32:19,810
And the better the tools for measurement,
the more precise you can be,

1635
01:32:19,811 --> 01:32:20,800
the more precise you can be,

1636
01:32:20,801 --> 01:32:24,730
the more specific the protocol is that
you can use and it's fucking amazing.

1637
01:32:24,731 --> 01:32:29,530
Like there's stuff going on right now
that is going to just turn things tight

1638
01:32:29,560 --> 01:32:31,060
upside down when it
comes to like training,

1639
01:32:31,061 --> 01:32:35,470
mental performance and reversing the
symptoms of of age from a cognitive

1640
01:32:35,471 --> 01:32:38,860
standpoint. So for me it's
just like God, like as,

1641
01:32:38,950 --> 01:32:42,220
as we follow Moore's law and
technology gets smaller and faster,

1642
01:32:42,550 --> 01:32:46,210
exponentially and the certain heat
issues when you get to a certain size,

1643
01:32:46,211 --> 01:32:50,320
but the tools we're going to have for
measurement five years are going to be

1644
01:32:50,321 --> 01:32:51,670
like Ray Kurzweil land.

1645
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:57,390
We're going to be able to isolate all
cofactors involving in new nutrition,

1646
01:32:57,540 --> 01:33:01,050
cellular development, the,
the evolution of the genetics.

1647
01:33:01,051 --> 01:33:03,830
We're going to have all of
that mapped out a lot. It,

1648
01:33:04,140 --> 01:33:07,620
I mean I think the rate of
progress is going to increase.

1649
01:33:08,310 --> 01:33:11,220
How could it not really dramatically
so we won't have it all figured out,

1650
01:33:11,221 --> 01:33:15,510
but do you think we'll get to the point
where we create an artificial person I

1651
01:33:15,511 --> 01:33:20,340
think will absolutely get to the point
where we get where we're able to create

1652
01:33:20,460 --> 01:33:22,620
an artificial person
that tricks most people.

1653
01:33:22,710 --> 01:33:24,690
I think that's going to happen
sooner than people expect.

1654
01:33:24,780 --> 01:33:28,980
That's going to be so fucking weird. Yeah,
I mean it's like the Turing test, right?

1655
01:33:28,981 --> 01:33:31,590
So, and somebody could call me
on this if I'm fucking it up,

1656
01:33:31,591 --> 01:33:35,850
but I believe the Turing test was having
a base effectively a chat communication

1657
01:33:35,851 --> 01:33:40,020
between a real human and a computer and
having that computer trick the human

1658
01:33:40,021 --> 01:33:44,800
into believing that it is another human.
And I think the,

1659
01:33:45,210 --> 01:33:48,210
the more interesting Turing test is when
you get an artificial humans sitting

1660
01:33:48,211 --> 01:33:51,810
across from you who tricks you fools you
into believing that it's another human.

1661
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:53,130
And I don't think,

1662
01:33:54,750 --> 01:33:58,380
I mean maybe I'm in my own sort of
echo chamber living in silicon valley,

1663
01:33:58,381 --> 01:34:01,800
but just seeing how quickly
things are moving and how,

1664
01:34:03,150 --> 01:34:05,820
how quickly things are getting quicker.
I just,

1665
01:34:05,821 --> 01:34:09,300
I think I'd be surprised if we don't
hit that point in five to 10 years.

1666
01:34:09,330 --> 01:34:10,470
I'd be super surprised.

1667
01:34:11,990 --> 01:34:14,930
It's amazing when you really stop
and think about what lies ahead.

1668
01:34:15,290 --> 01:34:20,290
We are so far away from the reality that
existed when I was just in high school,

1669
01:34:20,391 --> 01:34:22,310
which is 20 years ago.

1670
01:34:22,580 --> 01:34:26,810
It to look at the future and look at
what lies 20 years ahead from now.

1671
01:34:26,811 --> 01:34:30,140
It's almost unrecognizable.
Things are gonna get so strange.

1672
01:34:30,340 --> 01:34:33,430
Yeah. Well if you think about in
the movie minority report, right?

1673
01:34:33,431 --> 01:34:34,900
So minority report was made what,

1674
01:34:34,901 --> 01:34:39,130
like 10 years ago and like all of that
technology and I think that was supposed

1675
01:34:39,131 --> 01:34:41,410
to take place like 20 years
from now or whatever it is,

1676
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:43,000
that stuff's going to exist.

1677
01:34:43,001 --> 01:34:44,770
All of the screens that you can
move with your hands in everything,

1678
01:34:44,771 --> 01:34:48,740
I mean that's, that's going
to be widespread in the
next two years probably. Uh,

1679
01:34:48,780 --> 01:34:52,870
and you know, yeah, that's not even,
that's like that Microsoft surface thing.

1680
01:34:52,871 --> 01:34:55,320
It's very similar to that. We're
running ahead of schedule, you know,

1681
01:34:55,330 --> 01:34:58,580
like where things are, things are running
ahead of schedule and people give us a,

1682
01:34:58,581 --> 01:35:02,330
Ray Kurzweil is, um, I'm not sure if you
know who that is, but he, oh yeah, sure.

1683
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:06,140
All right.
So people because of some of his beliefs,

1684
01:35:06,141 --> 01:35:08,900
and I think there are few
of the ice conclusions are
clouded by the fact that he

1685
01:35:08,901 --> 01:35:11,360
fears mortality and wants to bring his
dad back to life, things like this.

1686
01:35:11,630 --> 01:35:14,240
But he's a brilliant guy with an
excellent track record of prediction.

1687
01:35:14,780 --> 01:35:15,501
So when he says like,

1688
01:35:15,501 --> 01:35:17,410
we're going to have nanobots
that you swallow it and be like,

1689
01:35:17,460 --> 01:35:19,580
we're able to diagnose all your
issues and fix all these problems.

1690
01:35:20,270 --> 01:35:22,900
I don't think he's that far
off with most of it. Um,

1691
01:35:25,130 --> 01:35:26,540
I really don't think he's that far off.

1692
01:35:26,570 --> 01:35:30,200
Are we going to be able to make people
immortal in the next 20 years and have it

1693
01:35:30,890 --> 01:35:35,890
very conveniently coincide with his
sort of expert projected median death

1694
01:35:36,561 --> 01:35:39,340
sentence? Uh, probably not, but uh,

1695
01:35:40,120 --> 01:35:43,100
but he's sort of opening
people's ideas or ah,

1696
01:35:43,180 --> 01:35:46,210
mine's up rather to the
possibility that these,

1697
01:35:46,240 --> 01:35:51,240
there's like there's sort
of an extrapolation that he
has made that maybe other

1698
01:35:52,361 --> 01:35:55,450
people would just not be qualified
or have the vision to see.

1699
01:35:55,870 --> 01:35:57,070
And when he lays it out,

1700
01:35:57,071 --> 01:36:01,330
it really sort of changes the entire
game because when it becomes a mainstream

1701
01:36:01,331 --> 01:36:05,890
idea, like transcendent man has
documentary all of a sudden, amazing,

1702
01:36:06,110 --> 01:36:10,630
fascinating insight into him as a
human being too. But it all, it that,

1703
01:36:10,631 --> 01:36:14,530
that all of a sudden that becomes
like a alive meme, you know,

1704
01:36:14,531 --> 01:36:17,920
and that idea sort of grows,
you know,

1705
01:36:18,160 --> 01:36:21,450
because of the fact that he's
talking about it on this hill.

1706
01:36:21,470 --> 01:36:24,460
The hill accelerate it unquestionably.
Unquestionably.

1707
01:36:24,530 --> 01:36:29,460
And uh, I actually saw the, uh, it
was the debut of transcendent man, uh,

1708
01:36:29,490 --> 01:36:32,750
or trends at dental,
one of the two at Tribeca film festival.

1709
01:36:32,751 --> 01:36:35,900
And Ray was literally right here.
He was sitting in front of me watching it,

1710
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:40,310
which was pretty cool to sort of watch
him watching this movie. Was it weird?

1711
01:36:40,340 --> 01:36:43,720
Like what wasn't that
weird? I'm a, uh, so I'm,

1712
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:49,220
well I guess starting few years ago and
for a number of years was a visiting

1713
01:36:49,221 --> 01:36:54,221
faculty member for the Finance and
entrepreneurship track of Singularity

1714
01:36:54,980 --> 01:36:57,800
University, which ray started
along with Peter Diamandis,

1715
01:36:57,830 --> 01:37:01,600
chairman of the x prize based at Ames,

1716
01:37:02,180 --> 01:37:05,510
NASA location in mountain view,
California.

1717
01:37:05,960 --> 01:37:09,110
So I've had a chance to
interact with a lot of, of,

1718
01:37:09,140 --> 01:37:14,140
of Ray's cohorts and colleagues as well
as Ram self and Peter Diamandis who's a

1719
01:37:14,991 --> 01:37:17,810
really impressive guy in
his own right and, uh,

1720
01:37:19,390 --> 01:37:21,670
raises smart guy. I mean he's, he's,

1721
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:26,810
I like that he doesn't back down.
So I think when,

1722
01:37:26,900 --> 01:37:30,410
when a lot of people who are very,
very smart have extremely bold ideas,

1723
01:37:30,620 --> 01:37:32,180
they sorta get brow beaten into,

1724
01:37:32,360 --> 01:37:35,750
into curtailing their belief really

1725
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:40,490
well.
I think that ray has,

1726
01:37:40,550 --> 01:37:45,110
has stood up to critics so many times
and gone on TV so many times despite the

1727
01:37:45,111 --> 01:37:48,690
fact that he's, he's
given, people tend to,

1728
01:37:48,850 --> 01:37:53,240
to completely dismiss a lot of his stuff
out of hand. And I just like that he is,

1729
01:37:54,110 --> 01:37:58,410
he has so much intestinal fortitude
to stick to his guns like his,

1730
01:37:58,411 --> 01:38:02,880
his level of conviction, um, based
on everything that he has seen.

1731
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:05,700
Uh, I think it's warranted. Number one.

1732
01:38:06,240 --> 01:38:08,460
I just find it very add
admirable that he doesn't,

1733
01:38:08,610 --> 01:38:12,600
he doesn't hedge or try
to like concede or, uh,

1734
01:38:12,620 --> 01:38:13,860
in any way to negotiate.

1735
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:17,390
See I'm so out of the loop and I hang
out with such a bunch of Weirdos that no

1736
01:38:17,391 --> 01:38:21,650
one that I hang out with even remotely
thinks that it's crazy. You know,

1737
01:38:21,651 --> 01:38:26,300
I hang out with this great, great chem
trails and shit and left and right.

1738
01:38:26,690 --> 01:38:31,630
So this like coming singularity is like,
oh yeah, that's happened. Yeah. I mean,

1739
01:38:31,631 --> 01:38:32,120
and

1740
01:38:32,120 --> 01:38:36,740
I'm also living, I live in San
Francisco and it's sick. Yeah.

1741
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:39,650
And people who want to colonize
Mars and shit. So it's like,

1742
01:38:39,651 --> 01:38:43,670
it's not that out of reach for,
for people that I spend time with.

1743
01:38:44,270 --> 01:38:45,103
Uh,

1744
01:38:45,940 --> 01:38:49,270
in any case, some people don't see
it. They see it differently than him.

1745
01:38:49,271 --> 01:38:50,590
And they're also brilliant men.

1746
01:38:50,740 --> 01:38:54,070
Like a Hugo de Garis who was
in that documentary as well,

1747
01:38:54,071 --> 01:38:57,820
who believes that he calls them our
deluxe, the artificial intellect.

1748
01:38:58,150 --> 01:39:01,570
And he doesn't think it's a rosy
scenario for the human race at all.

1749
01:39:01,571 --> 01:39:05,020
He doesn't get the I robot. Yeah.
He's got that scenario going on.

1750
01:39:05,220 --> 01:39:07,750
He thinks that some shit,
you know,

1751
01:39:07,751 --> 01:39:10,650
is going to get completely away from
us and just going, I think it's,

1752
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:11,553
it's extremely light.

1753
01:39:11,830 --> 01:39:16,430
I mean, humans are constantly
creating things that can destroy it.

1754
01:39:17,440 --> 01:39:21,610
Yeah. Everything. So who
our best accomplishments
are all destructive. I mean,

1755
01:39:21,620 --> 01:39:24,910
that that would be, people would say
that's really an ignorant thing to say.

1756
01:39:25,090 --> 01:39:27,820
But I would say that the most impressive
things that people have figured out how

1757
01:39:27,821 --> 01:39:32,140
to do is to create nuclear bombs and
to, uh, make the large Hadron collider,

1758
01:39:32,141 --> 01:39:34,480
which is not, you know, not
necessarily destructive thing.

1759
01:39:34,490 --> 01:39:36,820
The large Hadron collider
is not a destructive thing,

1760
01:39:36,821 --> 01:39:40,860
but it does make microscopic
black holes. You know, you,

1761
01:39:40,861 --> 01:39:43,600
you really have to realize
that, that you're, you're doing,

1762
01:39:43,660 --> 01:39:46,270
you're creating some
incredible amount of energy.

1763
01:39:46,271 --> 01:39:51,271
Some you releasing some in amazing amount
of energy to make these Adam's collide

1764
01:39:52,031 --> 01:39:54,970
at the speed of light or just
slightly under the speed of light.

1765
01:39:55,150 --> 01:39:58,330
It's not destructive, don't get me wrong,
but it's bordering on it. It's like,

1766
01:39:58,331 --> 01:40:01,810
what are you doing? You know,
you're, you're figuring out
a way to fuck with Matt.

1767
01:40:01,840 --> 01:40:03,820
What's going to happen from
that? I mean it's, well,

1768
01:40:03,821 --> 01:40:06,820
it's eventually going to get to
something that you can use to like make a

1769
01:40:06,821 --> 01:40:10,030
country turn into a hole. You
know, you'll just have a whole,

1770
01:40:10,031 --> 01:40:12,680
where this one country used to be a void.
Yeah.

1771
01:40:12,770 --> 01:40:16,600
You'll have like the no matter the
nothing in the never ending story.

1772
01:40:17,050 --> 01:40:19,810
Imagine I'm going to be that first
person and try to fuck a black hole.

1773
01:40:20,440 --> 01:40:24,630
You probably already have you. Um,

1774
01:40:25,390 --> 01:40:26,260
if you,
um,

1775
01:40:27,010 --> 01:40:31,180
if you can conceive of the idea of
someone dropping an atomic bomb on a city

1776
01:40:31,181 --> 01:40:33,030
full of people that had
nothing to do with the,

1777
01:40:33,031 --> 01:40:36,970
the conflict and really had no choice
whatsoever and where they were born,

1778
01:40:37,060 --> 01:40:41,380
which is exactly what we did in the
1940s and then Nagasaki and Hiroshima.

1779
01:40:41,710 --> 01:40:43,150
If you can conceive of that,

1780
01:40:43,360 --> 01:40:47,260
the next step is literally you show up
where this town used to be and there's a

1781
01:40:47,320 --> 01:40:49,930
giant black hole.

1782
01:40:50,200 --> 01:40:55,200
It just sitting there and you can't get
too to it and it's just no matter and

1783
01:40:55,721 --> 01:40:59,470
you can't see through it and just sits
there and that's where the town used to

1784
01:40:59,471 --> 01:41:01,600
be and someone just decided to erase it.

1785
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:03,340
That's not outside the
realm of possibility.

1786
01:41:03,341 --> 01:41:06,130
A nuclear bomb itself is fucking bananas.

1787
01:41:06,131 --> 01:41:10,360
That idea is crazy that you could figure
out a way to harness the very power of

1788
01:41:10,361 --> 01:41:14,440
the sun itself and drop it on a city and
instantly make a half a million people

1789
01:41:14,441 --> 01:41:18,430
just disappear. The, you could do that.
You can come up with the next slide,

1790
01:41:18,431 --> 01:41:20,410
the next level shit's
going to be even nuttier.

1791
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:23,770
And that's the forefront
of our capabilities.

1792
01:41:23,771 --> 01:41:27,070
And of course he's like distribution of
information and beautiful things that

1793
01:41:27,071 --> 01:41:30,890
have come from, you know,
medical innovation and, you
know, the, the scientific, uh,

1794
01:41:31,010 --> 01:41:33,220
understanding of the world,
the universe we live in.

1795
01:41:33,221 --> 01:41:35,470
It's beautiful and it helps
the growth of the human being.

1796
01:41:35,620 --> 01:41:37,000
But at the end of the day,

1797
01:41:37,470 --> 01:41:42,100
what we really like doing is figuring
out a way to fuck things up with like

1798
01:41:42,101 --> 01:41:43,580
extreme efficiency.

1799
01:41:44,300 --> 01:41:48,200
Yet a lot of that is the,
uh, to the potential of like
an accidental black swan.

1800
01:41:48,201 --> 01:41:50,330
Like, oops, like we thought
we were going to do this,

1801
01:41:50,331 --> 01:41:54,030
but now we have a black hole over Toledo.
Oh yeah. And then there's the, uh,

1802
01:41:54,200 --> 01:41:57,830
all of the stuff behind the scenes that
people don't see where there are very

1803
01:41:57,831 --> 01:42:01,710
competent people who are very
deliberately trying to destroy the thing.

1804
01:42:01,711 --> 01:42:03,950
So you think, oh, I don't think,

1805
01:42:03,951 --> 01:42:06,990
I mean I have friends who
were on deployments to
different places and they're

1806
01:42:07,010 --> 01:42:07,341
like,
oh yeah,

1807
01:42:07,341 --> 01:42:12,341
we just got a bio like biotech terrorist
with a phd from like Brand Name

1808
01:42:12,830 --> 01:42:15,160
University in the u s and Yemen who's
trying to build a dirty bomb to like

1809
01:42:15,170 --> 01:42:19,570
explode over the Great Lakes using a blah,
blah, blah. And we're just like, whoa,

1810
01:42:19,580 --> 01:42:21,410
huck,
like the number of times.

1811
01:42:23,710 --> 01:42:24,371
So do you think,

1812
01:42:24,371 --> 01:42:27,070
do you subscribe to the idea that that's
what's going on with the United States

1813
01:42:27,071 --> 01:42:28,900
government? That's why he's
trying to clamp down on, on,

1814
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:31,030
on personal liberties and freedoms.

1815
01:42:31,210 --> 01:42:34,810
It's really is to protect people because
there's so much shit going on that we

1816
01:42:34,811 --> 01:42:36,970
don't know about.
I would love if that was true,

1817
01:42:37,230 --> 01:42:40,870
but there's so much shit going on that
we don't know about that they have to.

1818
01:42:40,871 --> 01:42:43,780
It's not like they want to read your
email and find out who you're sending Dick

1819
01:42:43,780 --> 01:42:44,230
Pictures to.

1820
01:42:44,230 --> 01:42:47,650
What they want to do is make sure that
no one's making a fucking dirty bomb and

1821
01:42:47,651 --> 01:42:51,250
there's only one way to really do that
is to monitor everybody's email and look

1822
01:42:51,251 --> 01:42:52,300
for certain words.

1823
01:42:52,750 --> 01:42:55,450
But then you're going to arrest Bryan
because he'll call a girl. I'm like,

1824
01:42:55,451 --> 01:42:58,600
I'm going to leave a dirty bomb
in your mouth and then boom,

1825
01:42:58,750 --> 01:43:00,010
next thing you know you're in jail.

1826
01:43:01,410 --> 01:43:03,960
I think there's a fine line
between the two. I mean,

1827
01:43:03,961 --> 01:43:07,680
I think that once you sort of set the
juggernaut and motion for like constant

1828
01:43:07,681 --> 01:43:12,681
surveillance and warrant free
wire tapping and whatnot,

1829
01:43:13,470 --> 01:43:15,810
that yeah,
it's a fun,

1830
01:43:15,900 --> 01:43:20,850
I think it's very hard to have to
not have the, to go lockstep, uh,

1831
01:43:21,460 --> 01:43:22,293
hand in hand.

1832
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:24,450
The other issue is human beings,

1833
01:43:24,451 --> 01:43:28,440
whenever they have power over
other human beings, they abuse it.

1834
01:43:28,490 --> 01:43:31,170
You could go back to the Sanford prison
studies that they did where they were

1835
01:43:31,171 --> 01:43:31,801
trying to,

1836
01:43:31,801 --> 01:43:36,801
Stanford was they got as students to
pretend to be jail house guards and

1837
01:43:37,800 --> 01:43:38,880
prisoners and they had a stop.

1838
01:43:38,881 --> 01:43:41,850
The experiments really quickly because
people are all immediately started

1839
01:43:41,851 --> 01:43:44,740
abusing each other and
that was supposed to go on

1840
01:43:44,770 --> 01:43:47,890
for something like a week or two weeks.
I cancelled it I think after 48 hours

1841
01:43:48,420 --> 01:43:50,190
and you're in the problem.

1842
01:43:50,220 --> 01:43:55,220
One of the big with the idea
of warrantless surveillance
is that you're allowing

1843
01:43:55,521 --> 01:44:00,521
people that are just regular folks to
decide whether or not they should spy on

1844
01:44:00,981 --> 01:44:04,940
people and whether or not they should
take their information or whether or not

1845
01:44:04,941 --> 01:44:07,700
they should fuck with their lives.
You're regular foot,

1846
01:44:08,160 --> 01:44:12,050
you have no evidence whatsoever. They
are enlightened, no evidence whatsoever.

1847
01:44:12,060 --> 01:44:15,920
They're operating on a higher frequency.
We'll all with the good of mankind.

1848
01:44:16,580 --> 01:44:20,420
There's no evidence whatsoever that
government people are any different than

1849
01:44:20,421 --> 01:44:23,960
regular people and regular
people are fucking crazy.

1850
01:44:24,380 --> 01:44:29,380
Regular people are on antidepressants
taking sleeping pills and drinking every

1851
01:44:29,720 --> 01:44:32,780
weekend and they're doing drugs and
they're all fucked up in the head and who

1852
01:44:32,781 --> 01:44:36,470
knows on what Ssri is there on.
That's everybody.

1853
01:44:36,471 --> 01:44:38,450
That's a huge percentage
of our population,

1854
01:44:38,720 --> 01:44:43,720
including people in government and we've
seen with his general Patraeus thing,

1855
01:44:44,540 --> 01:44:47,210
okay. That the people at the
highest level of government,

1856
01:44:47,390 --> 01:44:52,070
the guy who's the head of the fucking CNA
still can't keep his pitches in check.

1857
01:44:52,310 --> 01:44:57,110
He's still got regular people problems.
The guy's still got like affairs.

1858
01:44:57,111 --> 01:45:00,970
He's still got, you know, this hot woman
who's married and this is going on a site

1859
01:45:02,570 --> 01:45:04,760
and these people,
that's the CIA,

1860
01:45:04,790 --> 01:45:07,670
they're allowed what an
I were ironically enough.

1861
01:45:07,671 --> 01:45:11,750
What I think is fascinating about this
is this must allow the people at the

1862
01:45:11,751 --> 01:45:14,540
highest levels of government to understand
how dangerous it says because the

1863
01:45:14,541 --> 01:45:16,190
whole thing came about.

1864
01:45:16,191 --> 01:45:20,930
Like his exposure came about because
the FBI was investigating the CIA,

1865
01:45:21,620 --> 01:45:25,070
FBI and a CIA don't like each other.
All it's so, I didn't know that.

1866
01:45:25,071 --> 01:45:25,821
Did you know that?

1867
01:45:25,821 --> 01:45:29,630
Did you ever think that the FBI and
the CIA didn't like each other? No.

1868
01:45:30,410 --> 01:45:33,890
I have a friend who explained to me that
the navy seals and the marines do not

1869
01:45:33,891 --> 01:45:34,070
like

1870
01:45:34,070 --> 01:45:37,880
each other. There's a lot of
infighting. That shit is ridiculous.

1871
01:45:37,990 --> 01:45:39,370
Ton of infighting and you know what?

1872
01:45:39,371 --> 01:45:43,300
What mildly don't like each other or
like want to kick each other's asses.

1873
01:45:46,140 --> 01:45:48,410
Well, the, yeah, maybe, maybe it's,

1874
01:45:48,750 --> 01:45:52,180
that's an unfair question to ask cause
you generalizing and lumping everybody

1875
01:45:52,181 --> 01:45:57,070
into one group. But I mean if you
look at let's say the Pfizer Bill,

1876
01:45:57,071 --> 01:45:59,050
which Obama passed a couple of years ago,

1877
01:45:59,470 --> 01:46:02,180
which effectively allows
warrantless wiretapping uh,

1878
01:46:02,320 --> 01:46:04,330
the response that people have,

1879
01:46:04,390 --> 01:46:07,810
which I understand in which was the
response I had for a long time is I don't

1880
01:46:07,811 --> 01:46:11,860
have anything to hide if it keeps
everyone safer, go for it. Right.

1881
01:46:12,100 --> 01:46:16,690
The problem with that is when you have
people in power like to stay in power,

1882
01:46:17,380 --> 01:46:21,910
obviously enough, when you have that
type of warrantless wiretapping,

1883
01:46:22,060 --> 01:46:25,270
who do you think are going to be the
first people who get wired that every

1884
01:46:25,271 --> 01:46:30,260
member of Congress. Sure. How all
your opposition, how many people have,

1885
01:46:30,270 --> 01:46:33,520
so what percentage of congressman
or congresswoman have dirty laundry?

1886
01:46:33,910 --> 01:46:38,800
100% everybody has fucking dirty laundry.
I mean it's easy enough to, you know,

1887
01:46:39,010 --> 01:46:40,840
especially the old school people
that have been around long a long

1888
01:46:40,840 --> 01:46:44,500
time. They were, they were rocking it
like pre-internet, you know, if you want,

1889
01:46:44,560 --> 01:46:48,730
you know, like Teddy Kennedy, like you
want to go to like to his past like that,

1890
01:46:48,731 --> 01:46:53,340
you know the, those guys like that, the
fucking Newt Gingrich's of the world,

1891
01:46:53,490 --> 01:46:57,030
that they rocked it that way long
before the distribution of information.

1892
01:46:57,031 --> 01:47:01,560
So now that all this stuff is out and
everybody's tapping everything like, whoa.

1893
01:47:01,730 --> 01:47:02,070
Yeah.

1894
01:47:02,070 --> 01:47:07,070
You see with the portrayal scandal
clearly mapped out the problem with this

1895
01:47:07,651 --> 01:47:11,700
whole situation because there is
fucking no reason this should be news.

1896
01:47:11,820 --> 01:47:16,500
There's no reason this should be
investigated by anybody that's in any

1897
01:47:16,680 --> 01:47:21,210
organization that's trying to stop
crime because there was no crime being

1898
01:47:21,211 --> 01:47:25,320
committed other than I guess morals
violations by the guy who supposed to be

1899
01:47:26,160 --> 01:47:29,160
exemplary of the military,
his highest honors. Yeah.

1900
01:47:29,161 --> 01:47:31,740
I guess you can look at it that way,
but the reality is there's no,

1901
01:47:31,770 --> 01:47:32,670
no one's in danger.

1902
01:47:32,760 --> 01:47:36,680
Like why are you wasting resources on
his fucking national enquirer shit. Yeah.

1903
01:47:36,750 --> 01:47:40,500
And the attitude you go about doing
it well, it's all so obvious. Like,

1904
01:47:40,501 --> 01:47:43,590
you can't allow people to just
check shit out because the woman,

1905
01:47:43,740 --> 01:47:48,630
she was just like some crazy bitch that's
like this socialite flirts with guys.

1906
01:47:48,810 --> 01:47:52,860
And then there's this other one who's
the author whose email and that girl

1907
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:56,370
saying, get away from my man.
And she calls the FBI says,

1908
01:47:56,371 --> 01:48:00,510
this bitch is threatening me. She turned
the FBI honor. And then they're like,

1909
01:48:00,511 --> 01:48:02,040
why is this?
What's going on here?

1910
01:48:02,130 --> 01:48:07,130
And then the guy who's investigating it
sends shirtless pictures of himself to

1911
01:48:08,761 --> 01:48:13,080
the chick. So then they stopped
the investigation. They go,

1912
01:48:13,081 --> 01:48:15,030
what the fuck are you doing?
You can't send to,

1913
01:48:15,240 --> 01:48:18,990
so they investigate him and find out
that he's doing creepy shit while he's

1914
01:48:18,991 --> 01:48:22,500
investigating. Portray us
and this girl, oh my God,

1915
01:48:22,710 --> 01:48:27,270
it's so clear.
Just that as a map should be stop,

1916
01:48:27,720 --> 01:48:32,460
stop looking in each other's fucking
emails. Jesus Christ, you women,

1917
01:48:33,570 --> 01:48:35,970
the FBI shouldn't be a
bunch of fucking women.

1918
01:48:36,120 --> 01:48:41,120
The FBI should be one of
the most distinguished group
of people in the position

1919
01:48:41,131 --> 01:48:42,780
of power in this fucking country.

1920
01:48:42,990 --> 01:48:46,680
You're not supposed to be investigating
who's blowing who. That's ridiculous.

1921
01:48:46,681 --> 01:48:49,770
There's shit to be done. Yeah,
we're in two wars. You fucks.

1922
01:48:50,160 --> 01:48:54,180
You can't send shirtless pictures of
yourself just chilling at the barbecue.

1923
01:48:54,181 --> 01:48:59,010
Thinking about our case, flexing
your six pack. You fucking asshole.

1924
01:48:59,700 --> 01:49:02,430
We're sick.
We're a God damn sick nation.

1925
01:49:02,610 --> 01:49:06,310
What we need is legalized
prostitution and no more snooping.

1926
01:49:06,530 --> 01:49:11,180
Those are two things we need to calm
everybody the fuck down those those

1927
01:49:11,181 --> 01:49:14,710
gentlemen in this position
of power clearly need some
sort of an extracurricular

1928
01:49:14,830 --> 01:49:18,650
release. Yeah. I'm not saying everybody
needs it. I'm not saying I'm, I'm happy,

1929
01:49:18,651 --> 01:49:19,280
I'm good,

1930
01:49:19,280 --> 01:49:23,240
but what I'm saying is you need to figure
out a way to calm these motherfuckers

1931
01:49:23,270 --> 01:49:25,070
down. Yeah, and that's the
only one that makes sense.

1932
01:49:25,071 --> 01:49:27,290
Stop reading their emails
and let them get blowjobs.

1933
01:49:28,490 --> 01:49:31,790
We're trying to fucking keep the
country safe. Yeah, I think that's it.

1934
01:49:31,850 --> 01:49:33,480
I think that's a pretty good concession.

1935
01:49:33,481 --> 01:49:36,290
You can't just go digging
into people's shit like that.

1936
01:49:36,291 --> 01:49:40,190
These guys are portraying
is 60 fucking years old.

1937
01:49:40,310 --> 01:49:45,310
That means for 40 whatever it
was years he operated with.

1938
01:49:46,731 --> 01:49:47,564
No,

1939
01:49:47,740 --> 01:49:51,970
he lived his life without a
fucking whisper of the Internet.

1940
01:49:52,120 --> 01:49:56,350
And he lived his life as a fucking
guy who's a professional killer.

1941
01:49:56,680 --> 01:50:00,670
Okay. And all of a sudden
introduce the internet,

1942
01:50:00,700 --> 01:50:04,780
this guy's life and to start snooping
on his email. I think that's rude. Yeah,

1943
01:50:05,050 --> 01:50:10,050
I think it's not fair. Those fucking
guys, they better stop this gear.

1944
01:50:10,090 --> 01:50:14,380
Stop this NSA thing that they're trying
to do when they're trying to make a

1945
01:50:14,440 --> 01:50:17,530
database of every phone call you've
ever made, every email you ever take,

1946
01:50:17,740 --> 01:50:19,120
every text message you ever make,

1947
01:50:19,180 --> 01:50:23,320
they're building some crazy facility
in Utah where they can just record

1948
01:50:23,321 --> 01:50:25,080
everything that gets done.
Well,

1949
01:50:25,090 --> 01:50:27,490
just in case they need to
investigate Tim Ferriss,

1950
01:50:27,491 --> 01:50:29,320
he's making terrorist threats
against the president.

1951
01:50:29,321 --> 01:50:31,340
Let's see what he's been doing online.
He doesn't even build,

1952
01:50:31,341 --> 01:50:33,760
the scarier thing is he's
not making terrorist threats,

1953
01:50:33,761 --> 01:50:37,950
but like Tim Ferriss propagating
a message that the, that the, uh,

1954
01:50:37,951 --> 01:50:39,580
the powers that be disagree with,

1955
01:50:39,870 --> 01:50:44,110
I mean you get to like a West Berlin
point pretty fucking quickly. Exactly.

1956
01:50:44,111 --> 01:50:44,521
And you know,

1957
01:50:44,521 --> 01:50:47,770
and people that think that's impossible
because America doesn't stay. That's not,

1958
01:50:47,890 --> 01:50:50,940
you're not dealing with America. You're
dealing with people. Yeah, exactly.

1959
01:50:51,120 --> 01:50:54,760
America is just an idea and I
love America. I love the idea,

1960
01:50:55,120 --> 01:50:59,260
but I just don't trust people to be in
a position of power and neither did the

1961
01:50:59,261 --> 01:51:02,710
people that fucking founded this country.
That was the whole point,

1962
01:51:02,920 --> 01:51:03,753
the whole point.

1963
01:51:03,970 --> 01:51:08,970
And we have slipped away from that to
the point where now we operate under this

1964
01:51:09,011 --> 01:51:13,690
semi democratic situation where you kind
of have a say, but not really. Yeah,

1965
01:51:13,930 --> 01:51:16,840
that's not cool. We're all
adults. That's not cool.

1966
01:51:16,841 --> 01:51:18,220
You don't have to do it that way.

1967
01:51:19,900 --> 01:51:23,110
There's really good a movie I'm going
to spell. I'm going to fuck up the name.

1968
01:51:23,111 --> 01:51:27,810
I think it's other people or
other people's lives about
West Berlin and there's

1969
01:51:27,811 --> 01:51:31,180
surveillance done in west Berlin.
It's a Ooh fucking great movie.

1970
01:51:31,181 --> 01:51:35,110
It's fascinating. But if people look
back to, not to dwell on this point,

1971
01:51:35,111 --> 01:51:39,790
but it's like people should
keep that potential in mind.

1972
01:51:40,060 --> 01:51:42,450
It's not that long ago that
we had McCarthyism. Right?

1973
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:46,780
And if you want to put McCarthyism on
steroids, like have every phone call,

1974
01:51:47,140 --> 01:51:50,560
every email that anyone
has ever sent. Um, my Lord,

1975
01:51:50,930 --> 01:51:54,460
I used to think that, that we, we learn,

1976
01:51:54,790 --> 01:51:57,700
but I think we learn and then we
forget and then we have to learn again.

1977
01:51:57,730 --> 01:52:00,820
I think we have these like cycles.
It's like the,

1978
01:52:00,821 --> 01:52:04,120
the coming and going of the
tides. I, cause when I was a kid,

1979
01:52:04,121 --> 01:52:06,730
I remember that the Vietnam
War ended when I was,

1980
01:52:06,860 --> 01:52:08,770
I think it was like seven or
eight or something like that.

1981
01:52:08,771 --> 01:52:11,560
And I remember it because I
remember very clearly thing,

1982
01:52:11,561 --> 01:52:15,550
I was really terrified of the
idea of war because, uh, my,

1983
01:52:15,600 --> 01:52:18,550
my stepfather had avoided the draft.
He got lucky.

1984
01:52:19,590 --> 01:52:22,510
He didn't get drafted,
but we knew people that did.

1985
01:52:22,540 --> 01:52:25,480
And it was really scary that these
people would go and they would have to go

1986
01:52:25,540 --> 01:52:28,990
someplace where they might get
shot and nobody wanted to do it.

1987
01:52:28,991 --> 01:52:31,690
And everybody seemed to not believe in it,
but yet it was still going on.

1988
01:52:31,840 --> 01:52:36,130
So when that war was over, I had
this real tangible sense of, okay,

1989
01:52:36,131 --> 01:52:40,870
we figured out that that
sucks. That's, we're not doing
that anymore. Like that is,

1990
01:52:41,080 --> 01:52:43,090
we figured out that war
is a terrible thing.

1991
01:52:43,090 --> 01:52:46,070
It's unnecessary now that the war is over,
we can relax.

1992
01:52:46,071 --> 01:52:51,071
And that was the case all through my life
through high school and into my early,

1993
01:52:51,620 --> 01:52:56,620
I guess I was maybe 21 when the first
Gulf War happened and I was living with my

1994
01:52:58,101 --> 01:53:01,010
friend Jimmy did Telia. We're
living in Waltham, Massachusetts,

1995
01:53:01,011 --> 01:53:04,610
and we're sitting in the middle of the
living room watching the shit on TV

1996
01:53:04,760 --> 01:53:08,120
because it was the first time they would
show you these like night vision shots

1997
01:53:08,121 --> 01:53:13,121
of these rockets flying through the air
in this Eerie Green Hue and you've seen

1998
01:53:13,221 --> 01:53:16,040
all these explosions and he just
looks at me, goes, well buddy,

1999
01:53:16,110 --> 01:53:20,240
looks like we're at war. That
Boston accent. I was like,

2000
01:53:20,241 --> 01:53:23,820
Holy Shit. Like we were
back to this. Yeah.

2001
01:53:24,050 --> 01:53:29,050
That one went nice and quick and then
post September 11th it's like the entire

2002
01:53:29,901 --> 01:53:34,340
lessons of generations that had
to go through World War II, Korea,

2003
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:35,600
Vietnam,

2004
01:53:35,600 --> 01:53:39,890
those lessons were that whatever
the society learned from that,

2005
01:53:40,260 --> 01:53:44,540
at least elusive was temporary
last temporarily temporarily.

2006
01:53:44,750 --> 01:53:48,830
We lost our fucking minds and now people
are starting to starting to come around

2007
01:53:48,831 --> 01:53:53,750
to it again and I'm hoping
that the evolution that we
make from this version of

2008
01:53:53,751 --> 01:53:58,750
it will be more lasting because of the
freedom of information rather than the

2009
01:53:58,751 --> 01:54:01,940
the free ability to distribute information
with the Internet that we can get it

2010
01:54:01,941 --> 01:54:04,940
out a little bit easier this time and then
we could say, listen ladies, gentlemen,

2011
01:54:04,970 --> 01:54:07,220
we're not saying we don't need government.
We certainly do.

2012
01:54:07,370 --> 01:54:10,280
We're not saying people shouldn't
have laws that they abide by.

2013
01:54:10,400 --> 01:54:13,160
They certainly should.
We should have a nice peaceful,

2014
01:54:13,370 --> 01:54:15,920
not saying you shouldn't make profit.
You certainly should.

2015
01:54:16,070 --> 01:54:18,080
What we're saying is you can't get crazy.

2016
01:54:18,330 --> 01:54:22,820
You can't go nutty and not look at humans
and not look at the human race as the

2017
01:54:22,821 --> 01:54:26,450
most important thing. Instead consonant
training on money, concentrating on,

2018
01:54:26,451 --> 01:54:26,631
you know,

2019
01:54:26,631 --> 01:54:30,230
the extraction of resources from strange
parts of the land that people aren't

2020
01:54:30,231 --> 01:54:32,420
really paying attention to
because it's not close by.

2021
01:54:32,480 --> 01:54:35,570
So it's okay to kill people with
robots that fly in the air. You know,

2022
01:54:35,571 --> 01:54:40,571
all of that is bananas and it doesn't
mean we can't keep a nice order in the

2023
01:54:41,901 --> 01:54:46,330
world. We can but we can't get
too fucking crazy. Yeah. And I'm,

2024
01:54:46,331 --> 01:54:51,240
I'm hoping that, I don't know if you
agree with this, but that there's a, uh,

2025
01:54:51,330 --> 01:54:56,330
a sort of a wrestling match
going on between the idea
of an apocalyptic scenario

2026
01:54:57,861 --> 01:55:02,861
that's human created and the idea of
technology and understanding meeting

2027
01:55:03,291 --> 01:55:06,200
somewhere in the middle
and working it out.

2028
01:55:06,980 --> 01:55:11,840
Yeah. No, I think that you
have technology that's,

2029
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:17,360
I would like to thank, you know, human
sort of self interested rationality,

2030
01:55:17,361 --> 01:55:18,194
but I don't know,

2031
01:55:18,310 --> 01:55:21,680
you have the technology to solve problems
which is developing really quickly.

2032
01:55:21,681 --> 01:55:24,510
And then you also have problems
that are compounding, right?

2033
01:55:24,620 --> 01:55:27,800
Just like money in a bank account.
You have these problems compounding,

2034
01:55:27,801 --> 01:55:29,860
whether it's climate change,
populate,

2035
01:55:29,861 --> 01:55:34,400
explosive population growth in certain
areas. And so it is a bit of a,

2036
01:55:36,940 --> 01:55:40,900
it's, it's a race in a sense. Um, and I,

2037
01:55:40,901 --> 01:55:44,670
I don't know which side is going to
come out in front. I mean, I'm very,

2038
01:55:44,671 --> 01:55:49,500
very curious about population growth and
how that population density and global

2039
01:55:49,501 --> 01:55:54,501
travel and how that compounds the impact
of something like avian flu or SARS or

2040
01:55:55,621 --> 01:55:56,460
whatever.
And it's like,

2041
01:55:57,060 --> 01:56:02,060
at what point do we reach a population
density where it is like the deer jumping

2042
01:56:02,101 --> 01:56:02,934
in front of your car,

2043
01:56:03,120 --> 01:56:08,120
where you just have such a high density
of people that the inevitability of a

2044
01:56:11,071 --> 01:56:16,071
disease and rapid spread globally through
air travel effectively just wipes out.

2045
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:22,840
It isn't that the sort of the natural
cycle of things is that when there's an

2046
01:56:22,841 --> 01:56:26,300
overpopulation is correction,
there's a correction. God,

2047
01:56:26,320 --> 01:56:31,060
it fucking terrifying to think of the
plague as a correction, you know, wild.

2048
01:56:31,560 --> 01:56:34,340
Uh, in any case, I mean,

2049
01:56:34,341 --> 01:56:37,400
so I'm actually probably going to
be getting a little bit of land in,

2050
01:56:37,480 --> 01:56:41,000
uh, you tell him, tell people Tim
Ferriss to come into your house.

2051
01:56:41,990 --> 01:56:44,870
Brian and I have been talking about
Columbus. His mom's got a compound.

2052
01:56:45,160 --> 01:56:46,790
We're gonna move in with Mrs Red Band.

2053
01:56:47,600 --> 01:56:52,480
I actually ended up visiting a couple
of, uh, from the last book, um,

2054
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,490
for our body. Had a number of
hedge fund managers who were,

2055
01:56:55,550 --> 01:56:59,900
who basically want to be the
guy from limitless a pro.
We got to talk about this.

2056
01:56:59,901 --> 01:57:03,650
I gotta take a Piss talk to Brian.
He's really all about limitless.

2057
01:57:03,740 --> 01:57:06,180
I will talk to Brian about limitless
and then I will piss off. It also

2058
01:57:06,180 --> 01:57:08,910
had like a gallon of water together boys.
We could do that.

2059
01:57:13,890 --> 01:57:18,510
Why, why is your were we were talking
about this earlier, a what you're,

2060
01:57:18,630 --> 01:57:23,580
your book is banned from bookstores.
Yeah. What's the, what's,

2061
01:57:23,581 --> 01:57:25,380
what's going on with that?
So the four hour,

2062
01:57:25,410 --> 01:57:30,300
the four hour chef is the first major
book out of Amazon publishing as Amazon,

2063
01:57:30,301 --> 01:57:35,070
about a year and a half ago announced
the launch of Amazon publishing in New

2064
01:57:35,070 --> 01:57:35,371
York City,

2065
01:57:35,371 --> 01:57:39,930
which would be competing against all of
the major publishers to recruit authors.

2066
01:57:40,040 --> 01:57:40,861
Right.
Uh,

2067
01:57:40,861 --> 01:57:45,861
and that's really making everyone in the
book industry extremely uncomfortable

2068
01:57:46,601 --> 01:57:50,190
because Amazon super ambitious and hyper,

2069
01:57:50,191 --> 01:57:54,720
hyper confident and competent also.
So the book is being banned as a result.

2070
01:57:54,721 --> 01:57:57,420
The first time I'm aware of that,

2071
01:57:57,470 --> 01:58:00,690
a book had been banned by
all of Barnes and noble,

2072
01:58:00,990 --> 01:58:05,690
tons of tons of indies. Uh, so they
even matter anymore because to me,

2073
01:58:05,760 --> 01:58:10,440
I barely even see bookstores anymore.
I mean, no, I'll tell you what the,

2074
01:58:10,441 --> 01:58:13,260
I think the play is. Um, so there,

2075
01:58:13,290 --> 01:58:18,290
what they want to do is kill Amazon
publishing so that they aren't able to

2076
01:58:18,630 --> 01:58:19,980
recruit good authors.

2077
01:58:20,460 --> 01:58:25,460
And so they want to make an example
out of me as this guy who's had two to

2078
01:58:26,550 --> 01:58:31,080
number one New York Times best is very
fortunately they want to say they want to

2079
01:58:31,110 --> 01:58:32,520
basically crippled me.

2080
01:58:32,521 --> 01:58:36,780
So I don't hit the New York Times list
and then point to that. And in effect,

2081
01:58:36,781 --> 01:58:39,690
say if that guy can't do
it with Amazon publishing,

2082
01:58:40,260 --> 01:58:43,870
don't sign with on publishing.
And uh, oh, is this,

2083
01:58:43,871 --> 01:58:46,910
you're talking about you're being banned
from Ben wanted to bring that up? Yeah,

2084
01:58:46,911 --> 01:58:50,080
yeah, yeah. I think it's the
most, uh, band boycotted,

2085
01:58:50,081 --> 01:58:53,740
whichever were 1100 bookstores more
than that now. So yeah, in the airport,

2086
01:58:53,780 --> 01:58:56,560
even the airport bookstores
or is that he's nothing. No,

2087
01:58:56,561 --> 01:59:00,820
the airport bookstores
are are interesting. Those
are basically, not always,

2088
01:59:00,821 --> 01:59:04,700
but effectively pay for play,
so that's like buying advertising almost.

2089
01:59:04,820 --> 01:59:06,670
You pay for placement
with a lot of people.

2090
01:59:06,970 --> 01:59:09,250
Fail to realize is let's
say at a Barnes and noble,

2091
01:59:09,251 --> 01:59:10,780
it's just like a Walmart like you have.

2092
01:59:10,781 --> 01:59:12,940
Coca Cola owns the first
20 feet of Walmart,

2093
01:59:12,941 --> 01:59:17,140
like they legitimately pay for that space.
Similarly,

2094
01:59:17,141 --> 01:59:19,810
if you walk into Barnes and noble
and you see like the the whatever,

2095
01:59:19,811 --> 01:59:22,480
whatever rack or the the new
note note worthy or whatever,

2096
01:59:22,481 --> 01:59:25,000
the store owners have
some decision over that,

2097
01:59:25,001 --> 01:59:29,470
but a lot of it is paid op advertiser.
That's why it's so hard.

2098
01:59:29,471 --> 01:59:32,920
If you're a self published to get books
into Barnes and all works, they're like,

2099
01:59:33,630 --> 01:59:36,220
you know what are you going to pass
for an end cap that's not free.

2100
01:59:36,370 --> 01:59:39,670
They also have to stay open. Man. Barnes
and nobles closed lefts and rights.

2101
01:59:39,671 --> 01:59:41,170
Hard to get people to
buy books these days.

2102
01:59:41,380 --> 01:59:43,510
I always said that if you want
to really starve to death,

2103
01:59:43,540 --> 01:59:48,430
open a bookstore in Miami, you know,
it's hard. It's hard. It's tough.

2104
01:59:48,670 --> 01:59:51,410
It's a tough business. And
either, I think that what, uh,

2105
01:59:54,820 --> 01:59:58,270
I'm curious to see what happens. So
they've banned you. Yeah, I'm out zero.

2106
01:59:58,330 --> 02:00:02,080
And actually if he was like
discussion, no. Well, what's,

2107
02:00:02,081 --> 02:00:04,330
what's really funny about
the whole situation?

2108
02:00:04,331 --> 02:00:07,180
There are a lot of things that are
amusing to me about it, but they,

2109
02:00:07,181 --> 02:00:08,050
at first they said,
well,

2110
02:00:08,051 --> 02:00:10,690
we're not going to carry Amazon published
books because you're not on the hook.

2111
02:00:10,780 --> 02:00:14,530
Like you won't let us put like the
four hour chef on that does look bad.

2112
02:00:14,980 --> 02:00:18,220
I have a nook. No, it looks not bad. No.
What I'm saying is they were saying, hey,

2113
02:00:18,221 --> 02:00:21,340
Amazon, you're not letting us put these
books on the Nook so we're not gonna,

2114
02:00:21,610 --> 02:00:22,900
we're not going to
carry you in the stores.

2115
02:00:23,170 --> 02:00:25,540
And then Amazon came back
and they're like, okay, fine.

2116
02:00:25,690 --> 02:00:29,860
Put It on the neck and principles.
Like I always still don't like you.

2117
02:00:29,950 --> 02:00:33,100
And so they, uh, yeah, they're not.
Yeah, they're not carrying it. In fact,

2118
02:00:33,101 --> 02:00:37,390
some of the Barnes and noble store owners
wanted to carry this book and they got

2119
02:00:37,510 --> 02:00:41,410
severe slapped down from corporate
because corporate got word that they were

2120
02:00:41,411 --> 02:00:44,890
ordering copies of the book and
they just gave them the iron fist.

2121
02:00:44,910 --> 02:00:48,280
Have you thought about organizing an
email campaign or something against Barnes

2122
02:00:48,281 --> 02:00:53,260
and nobles? Unfair practicing. I
said unfair. I think it's unfair.

2123
02:00:53,320 --> 02:00:55,430
Yeah,
it's deep feelings.

2124
02:00:55,610 --> 02:01:00,520
I feel like you know who it's unfair to
and this is the children, the children,

2125
02:01:01,210 --> 02:01:04,520
the poor refugees. No, it's, it's an,

2126
02:01:04,720 --> 02:01:08,940
it's unfair to their customers and
ultimately this is where I think they're,

2127
02:01:08,970 --> 02:01:10,060
they're,
they're missing the mark.

2128
02:01:10,720 --> 02:01:13,630
Number one is if even if
Amazon publishing fails,

2129
02:01:13,660 --> 02:01:17,210
that will not stop the move from print to
digital. That will not stop that trend.

2130
02:01:17,211 --> 02:01:19,030
It will not.
It will not even register.

2131
02:01:19,420 --> 02:01:24,420
Secondly is Vic only competition is
for loyal customers and bookstores.

2132
02:01:25,390 --> 02:01:27,190
Certainly more than ever
need loyal customers.

2133
02:01:27,970 --> 02:01:29,980
If someone comes until
it's at Barnes and noble,

2134
02:01:29,981 --> 02:01:32,710
browses around and then goes home
to buy the book on Amazon for price,

2135
02:01:32,740 --> 02:01:35,830
that person was never a
customer to begin with. If,

2136
02:01:35,831 --> 02:01:38,020
on the other hand somebody walks
into Barnes and noble and says,

2137
02:01:38,140 --> 02:01:41,330
I really want to buy copy, I want to buy
three copies of the four hour chef for,

2138
02:01:41,410 --> 02:01:44,800
you know, as Christmas presents and
for myself, and then they kick it.

2139
02:01:44,801 --> 02:01:49,801
It all that accomplishes is there
driving that loyal customer to Amazon to

2140
02:01:49,911 --> 02:01:54,860
become a customer of there. So I don't,
I don't quite understand the logic I,

2141
02:01:54,980 --> 02:01:58,610
but again it's, it's humans are
emotional, right? That's why it's,

2142
02:01:58,760 --> 02:02:02,420
it's so concerning among other reasons
about all the stuff we were talking about.

2143
02:02:02,450 --> 02:02:04,790
So I'm not sure if it's a
completely rational decision.

2144
02:02:05,090 --> 02:02:07,550
Amazon's a big scary company
to go to a lot of book sellers,

2145
02:02:07,551 --> 02:02:08,870
but I think that for instance,

2146
02:02:10,640 --> 02:02:14,840
the only way to keep print relevant for,

2147
02:02:16,790 --> 02:02:19,190
for the foreseeable,
let's say 10 15 years,

2148
02:02:19,400 --> 02:02:24,400
is to create a tactile experience like
works of art through publishers like

2149
02:02:24,771 --> 02:02:27,000
Faden, p, h, a I, d, d o,

2150
02:02:27,001 --> 02:02:30,470
and they make beautiful books that that
is next to impossible to replicate on

2151
02:02:30,471 --> 02:02:34,250
digital or to have a very unique
experience in a relationship with your

2152
02:02:34,251 --> 02:02:37,340
customers, like omnivore books in San
Francisco, which is all cookbooks.

2153
02:02:37,341 --> 02:02:38,630
It's all they sell.
He's like,

2154
02:02:38,631 --> 02:02:42,380
you want to know anything about
cookbooks by something at a print,

2155
02:02:42,860 --> 02:02:45,650
get a recommendation, meet one of the top
chefs in the world. That's where you go.

2156
02:02:45,890 --> 02:02:49,100
Really? That's a specialized sort
of corner store. It's cool. Yeah.

2157
02:02:49,101 --> 02:02:52,670
There's one called, uh, I think
it's Slotnick, Slo, t n, I,

2158
02:02:52,680 --> 02:02:55,370
C K cookbooks in New York City.
Same Story.

2159
02:02:55,371 --> 02:02:57,710
It's like the Mecca of cookbooks and
you want to know something about that.

2160
02:02:57,711 --> 02:03:01,040
That's where you go. And those
businesses will continue to thrive.

2161
02:03:01,041 --> 02:03:03,770
But it's like if you're competing against
digital for price and convenience,

2162
02:03:04,400 --> 02:03:08,540
it's going to be a pretty tough road.
And uh, but there are ways to counter it.

2163
02:03:08,541 --> 02:03:12,710
So I mean the only reason if I wanted
to just make more off of the book,

2164
02:03:12,711 --> 02:03:15,680
I would have stayed with other
publishers quite frankly. Um,

2165
02:03:15,740 --> 02:03:19,250
but Amazon was interesting because I
want to try new things and I want to be

2166
02:03:19,251 --> 02:03:21,680
allowed to try new things.
Like I'm doing a partner,

2167
02:03:21,750 --> 02:03:26,750
a content partnership with bit torrent.
I'm putting out like tons and tons.

2168
02:03:26,751 --> 02:03:31,751
I probably well over a gig
of free material and videos
and all this shit on bit

2169
02:03:31,951 --> 02:03:35,960
torrent because they have 160 million
users and that's the kind of thing that

2170
02:03:36,080 --> 02:03:40,190
Amazon will let me do. Whereas
others may not be so keen to let me.

2171
02:03:40,460 --> 02:03:42,500
The other thing that people are
talking about the distribution,

2172
02:03:42,501 --> 02:03:43,550
the distribution and they're like,

2173
02:03:43,580 --> 02:03:47,780
oh well what's Amazon going to do with
first thing, no publisher out there.

2174
02:03:47,781 --> 02:03:52,781
I don't think any publisher except for
Amazon in my case would let me do a 672

2175
02:03:54,470 --> 02:03:56,390
full color book with thousands of photos.

2176
02:03:56,391 --> 02:03:59,390
That is a fucking expensive book to make.
I don't think anyone else would have,

2177
02:03:59,391 --> 02:04:04,340
let me do it. Why is that? I understand.
Because the margin suck. It's a really,

2178
02:04:04,370 --> 02:04:08,090
really tremendously expensive book.
And you just, the way the photographs,

2179
02:04:08,091 --> 02:04:10,030
the print that it has
to be on. Yeah, exactly.

2180
02:04:10,040 --> 02:04:13,520
Like to create a really physical book,
a really beautiful physical book,

2181
02:04:13,970 --> 02:04:15,320
like a tactile experience.

2182
02:04:15,470 --> 02:04:19,280
There just aren't many publishers
will do that anymore. And, uh,

2183
02:04:20,350 --> 02:04:25,340
so, uh, you know, distribution aside, if
you, what's, what's really p seven assets,

2184
02:04:25,410 --> 02:04:26,243
um,

2185
02:04:26,330 --> 02:04:31,310
what makes Amazon interesting from the
standpoint of a content creator is that

2186
02:04:31,340 --> 02:04:35,090
if you look at almost any other
publisher, Simon and Schuster, whoever,

2187
02:04:35,091 --> 02:04:38,310
it doesn't matter,
they do not have any direct connection

2188
02:04:38,310 --> 02:04:42,810
to their readers. They sell to the head
buyer in a category of Barnes and noble.

2189
02:04:42,840 --> 02:04:45,330
They sell to the head
buyer category at books,

2190
02:04:45,331 --> 02:04:49,050
a million in the middle of the
country. Uh, but whereas Amazon,

2191
02:04:49,560 --> 02:04:51,060
I mean I use Amazon prime.

2192
02:04:51,360 --> 02:04:54,540
Amazon probably knows me better than I
know myself and a lot of ways like they

2193
02:04:54,541 --> 02:04:59,370
have such direct access to
tens of millions of customers.

2194
02:04:59,371 --> 02:05:02,040
It just makes it really
attractive as an experiment.

2195
02:05:02,130 --> 02:05:04,980
Whether it'll turn out like who the fuck
knows? Well no at the end of next week,

2196
02:05:05,970 --> 02:05:10,680
but that's a
really interesting scenario.

2197
02:05:10,980 --> 02:05:14,640
The Amazon has a couple of
good things going for it.

2198
02:05:14,641 --> 02:05:18,420
Besides the fact that people already know
it as a great place to buy things with

2199
02:05:18,421 --> 02:05:19,710
one click and buy books.

2200
02:05:20,070 --> 02:05:22,290
They have this new thing that
they're doing with audible,

2201
02:05:22,320 --> 02:05:26,060
which is one of the sponsors of this show.
Oh look,

2202
02:05:26,061 --> 02:05:30,570
we're doing whisper sync. Yeah. This is
the fucking coolest thing. Would whisper.

2203
02:05:30,571 --> 02:05:33,150
See I was going to save it for the
commercial, the next audible commercial,

2204
02:05:33,180 --> 02:05:33,901
which is this week.

2205
02:05:33,901 --> 02:05:38,901
But what whisper sync is essentially
is you read a book and say if you fall

2206
02:05:39,301 --> 02:05:43,020
asleep where wherever that it pages,

2207
02:05:43,200 --> 02:05:47,370
you can have it on your smart
phone where you get in your car,

2208
02:05:47,550 --> 02:05:48,361
you plug it in,

2209
02:05:48,361 --> 02:05:52,830
you have an app that plays through your
audio Jack and it picks up where you

2210
02:05:52,831 --> 02:05:56,740
left off and starts reading the book
to you while you're in traffic. Yeah,

2211
02:05:56,790 --> 02:06:00,660
exactly. We'll go from text to voice. It's
fucking beautiful. It's really amazing.

2212
02:06:00,740 --> 02:06:04,670
He said going from tax to an
actor's voice, right. So it'll sink.

2213
02:06:04,710 --> 02:06:07,830
Like if you're reading a book in bed
and then you get in your car to go to

2214
02:06:07,831 --> 02:06:10,350
working and you have
the audio book version,

2215
02:06:10,560 --> 02:06:12,840
then you'll pick up where
you left off reading it.

2216
02:06:12,840 --> 02:06:17,640
So do you have to sync it from
your, um, cure your kindle to it?

2217
02:06:17,690 --> 02:06:20,700
Does it as long as you're connected to
Wifi or three g it syncs automatically

2218
02:06:20,701 --> 02:06:24,260
and it syncs to your phone and your phone
knows what Scott, what's up in the car,

2219
02:06:24,270 --> 02:06:26,310
whatever that's predicted.
The government's got to know,

2220
02:06:26,510 --> 02:06:30,840
got to know what page of 50 shades of
grey exactly. Hawes and masturbated on

2221
02:06:32,550 --> 02:06:37,110
who is, it's it, um, it's so it's actors,
a reader or as a computer that reads it.

2222
02:06:37,440 --> 02:06:38,790
Do you know that? Uh, I built,

2223
02:06:38,820 --> 02:06:43,290
my understanding is that it syncs
with the point in the book that Oh,

2224
02:06:43,291 --> 02:06:47,040
they have this act to come to
hand. Ian Audio, audio book.

2225
02:06:47,220 --> 02:06:52,220
You buy an audio book on audible and then
because it's owned by Amazon and then

2226
02:06:53,611 --> 02:06:57,030
you're reading on your kindle,
let's say the next chapter,

2227
02:06:57,270 --> 02:07:00,390
you get in your car to listen to it and
it will continue where you left off in

2228
02:07:00,391 --> 02:07:03,650
the book reading. It's pretty
credible. That's wild. Yeah.
Here's the answer. It's a,

2229
02:07:03,750 --> 02:07:08,700
it's a, it's only on the kindle fire HD
and the kindle fire. That's two of them.

2230
02:07:08,701 --> 02:07:12,750
The 8.9 inches, the seven inch, the
second generation ones, they, um,

2231
02:07:12,840 --> 02:07:16,720
it's a professionally narrated
audio book. Amazing. Yeah.

2232
02:07:16,860 --> 02:07:18,420
It's pretty cool.
Yeah.

2233
02:07:18,421 --> 02:07:21,660
That might actually get people to start
like reading books for and learning some

2234
02:07:21,661 --> 02:07:24,150
shit. Yeah. That's,
that's, that's the future.

2235
02:07:24,390 --> 02:07:29,250
But it sucks that Barnes and noble
a is trying to keep you out. Yeah.

2236
02:07:29,251 --> 02:07:31,890
I mean, they really need me to
fail, so if I succeed next week,

2237
02:07:31,891 --> 02:07:35,100
they're going to have a big world to
trouble. So silly. Just sell the fucking,

2238
02:07:35,490 --> 02:07:38,830
yeah. I don't see, be in
bullies. Yeah. I mean they're,
they're really being bullies.

2239
02:07:38,831 --> 02:07:43,540
It, another thing is the, I mean, I've
had the prior, the prior two books,

2240
02:07:43,970 --> 02:07:46,470
very stupid. They're picking the
wrong guy to make an example of, yeah.

2241
02:07:46,540 --> 02:07:49,900
Like your your books or New York
Times bestseller, number one,

2242
02:07:49,901 --> 02:07:51,370
New York Times best sellers socket,

2243
02:07:51,400 --> 02:07:55,820
Amazon or Barnes and noble
talking to Amazon to suck.

2244
02:07:57,110 --> 02:08:01,060
I'll suck Amazon for you. Suck Barnes
and noble. Come on. Barnes and noble.

2245
02:08:01,061 --> 02:08:02,530
Get it together.
That's ridiculous.

2246
02:08:03,010 --> 02:08:06,880
It's silly. So, uh, yeah, it's going to
be a dog fight though. So we got some,

2247
02:08:06,881 --> 02:08:10,210
I could actually give you a give you a
scoop on some stuff that's happening next

2248
02:08:10,210 --> 02:08:14,850
week. But so for instance, uh,
nobody knows this yet. Oh, I know.

2249
02:08:15,100 --> 02:08:19,150
Yeah, yeah. No. This Doo Doo Doo
Doo Doo. Get new sound. Yeah.

2250
02:08:19,151 --> 02:08:23,250
So do you really? Yeah. You have
a breaking news. So ready? Go. Uh,

2251
02:08:23,290 --> 02:08:25,410
I have to find it. Oh, come on.

2252
02:08:26,850 --> 02:08:29,460
Semi break.
This was one of those fucking morning zoos

2253
02:08:31,440 --> 02:08:35,630
that's not Britain. Oh, that was
good. Definitely good. Damn good.

2254
02:08:35,890 --> 02:08:36,723
That was worth the wait.

2255
02:08:37,560 --> 02:08:39,180
Uh,
so you know,

2256
02:08:39,181 --> 02:08:42,300
what do you do when you get banned
by bookstores while you open your own

2257
02:08:42,301 --> 02:08:45,960
bookstores is what you do. So I am
actually going to be taking an outlet.

2258
02:08:46,590 --> 02:08:50,670
I'm partnering with a Panera Bread. Oh
Wow. Which a lot of people don't realize.

2259
02:08:50,671 --> 02:08:55,380
Pinera has like what, 2000 locations in
the u s and I was doing a pilot starting,

2260
02:08:55,410 --> 02:08:58,470
uh, what's tomorrow? Monday.
Tomorrow in New York City,

2261
02:08:58,471 --> 02:09:01,540
people will be able to buy the four hour
chef at retail at all of the pioneer

2262
02:09:01,541 --> 02:09:03,570
look, the four main penny or
locations in New York City.

2263
02:09:03,850 --> 02:09:08,170
Interesting. So like how
Starbucks sell cds now. Exactly.

2264
02:09:08,770 --> 02:09:09,700
And that's a,
that's a new thing.

2265
02:09:09,720 --> 02:09:12,960
Dang man, I think that's the way
to go. That's a perfect place.

2266
02:09:12,961 --> 02:09:15,720
Starbucks and Panera bread.
Yeah,

2267
02:09:15,990 --> 02:09:20,940
and they're also going to be at the
same time piloting. So Panera, right?

2268
02:09:20,941 --> 02:09:25,560
Bread Pan Pawn, right? They're going
to be piloting a slow carb diet,

2269
02:09:25,561 --> 02:09:28,860
hidden menu, which is from
like the four hour body stuff.

2270
02:09:28,861 --> 02:09:33,330
So if you want to actually effectively
eat paleo or eat slow carbon loose fat,

2271
02:09:33,340 --> 02:09:36,240
now you can go to this place that's known
for bread and actually get a slow carb

2272
02:09:36,241 --> 02:09:39,210
meal, which is pretty cool. It's going to
do both the simultaneous simultaneously.

2273
02:09:39,300 --> 02:09:43,100
That's amazing. How do you feel
about like seeing now there's,

2274
02:09:43,170 --> 02:09:46,410
there's so much awareness
for the content of food now.

2275
02:09:46,411 --> 02:09:51,330
You mean you see grass fed meat everywhere
now. It's part of the vernacular now.

2276
02:09:51,360 --> 02:09:55,120
This is what just didn't exist as
five, six years ago. I think. Great

2277
02:09:55,120 --> 02:09:56,680
thing,
as long as it's,

2278
02:09:56,830 --> 02:10:00,490
the labels are policed to some extent
so that assholes don't come along and

2279
02:10:00,491 --> 02:10:03,640
start mislabeling things purposefully,
which happens all the time.

2280
02:10:03,641 --> 02:10:08,380
But I think it's a great thing. And
I mean, one of the goals that, um,

2281
02:10:09,250 --> 02:10:14,080
that I have is to sort of create a, a, a,

2282
02:10:14,440 --> 02:10:19,000
a super trend of about 20 million
people who simply think about let's say

2283
02:10:19,001 --> 02:10:21,580
purchasing food from breakfast
differently or dinner differently.

2284
02:10:22,090 --> 02:10:25,810
And if you can create a super trend by
getting roughly that number of people to

2285
02:10:25,811 --> 02:10:30,100
change certain buying habit,
then I think we,

2286
02:10:30,101 --> 02:10:34,100
I think that this country
can really it towards

2287
02:10:34,160 --> 02:10:37,190
more of this,
a smaller producer,

2288
02:10:38,060 --> 02:10:42,230
many suppliers versus, you know,
monolithic industrial producers.

2289
02:10:42,231 --> 02:10:44,660
And once you do that, I mean,
once the money is there,

2290
02:10:45,170 --> 02:10:48,380
the supply will generate
itself. I mean, you'll have,

2291
02:10:48,410 --> 02:10:51,260
it'll be commercially viable for people
to do more of this grass fed stuff,

2292
02:10:51,261 --> 02:10:52,310
which we already see coming.

2293
02:10:52,610 --> 02:10:55,850
It's just I want to stick kind of a
Archimedes lever in the whole thing and

2294
02:10:55,851 --> 02:10:59,540
fucking blow it up, which is part of,
uh, what I hope to do in the next,

2295
02:11:00,140 --> 02:11:01,340
I don't know,
12 months or so.

2296
02:11:01,430 --> 02:11:06,430
How much different would communities be
if every neighborhood had a little mini

2297
02:11:06,441 --> 02:11:09,940
farm? Yeah, yeah, exactly.
Like a shared gardener garden.

2298
02:11:10,100 --> 02:11:13,040
And we all sort of chipped in
and everybody had responsibility,

2299
02:11:13,070 --> 02:11:17,090
Neighborhood Watch type thing, and
it's not that farfetched. I mean,

2300
02:11:17,091 --> 02:11:19,220
it's not that far fetched at all.
Well,

2301
02:11:19,221 --> 02:11:22,790
the problem with cars is that now
we don't have communities anymore.

2302
02:11:22,970 --> 02:11:24,470
Like I don't live near any of my friends.

2303
02:11:24,471 --> 02:11:27,290
I've been trying to get everybody
to move near me. That's not working.

2304
02:11:27,590 --> 02:11:30,410
We're going to have to buy land somewhere.
But I thought,

2305
02:11:30,860 --> 02:11:32,950
how great would it be
if I lived in the same.
