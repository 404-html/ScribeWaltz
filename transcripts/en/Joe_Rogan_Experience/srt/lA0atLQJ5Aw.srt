1
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,550
Why were you looking at me?
So slide Jamie,

2
00:00:07,551 --> 00:00:10,480
you made me nervous.
It made me nervous.

3
00:00:10,481 --> 00:00:11,510
I like,
what is he doing?

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,130
Is he playing or we already live,
we're fucking live.

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,300
So,
um,

6
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:18,163
I tweeted something today that somebody 
tweeted me or I read something that 

7
00:00:21,141 --> 00:00:23,330
somebody tweeted.
So I quoted it but it wasn't right.

8
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:24,933
God dammit.
That is pretty close that Donald Trump 

9
00:00:27,321 --> 00:00:32,321
will be 70 years old and six days.
So it is seven months in,

10
00:00:35,361 --> 00:00:36,650
six days,
seven months.

11
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,900
Seven year olds,
70 years old.

12
00:00:38,901 --> 00:00:42,380
Seven months and six days.
Almost seven year old years old.

13
00:00:42,381 --> 00:00:46,460
Seven months and seven days when he 
becomes the president.

14
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:51,880
And he won by 77 electoral votes from 
seven electors.

15
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:53,533
Wow.
Yeah.

16
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:56,450
Happy seventh anniversary of the jre 
too.

17
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:58,940
This is basically it.
Yeah.

18
00:00:58,980 --> 00:00:59,970
Pretty close.
Mara.

19
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,890
Yeah.
How crazy is that?

20
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:04,200
I,
this is crazy.

21
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,320
So a lot of sevens 97.
Why are you obsessed with seven?

22
00:01:07,321 --> 00:01:08,154
It's like why is your sure

23
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,053
came from the jre one time we were 
talking about how we were in a 

24
00:01:11,461 --> 00:01:15,660
simulation theory and how everything's 
made out of ones and Zeros.

25
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,210
And I said something like,
I'm going to hack it.

26
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:20,640
I'm ready to start saying sevens or 
something.

27
00:01:20,641 --> 00:01:23,190
I can't even remember what it was.
But it's all from that.

28
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,410
So this is your shirt that has all 
seven.

29
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:25,921
It's,
yeah,

30
00:01:25,921 --> 00:01:27,310
it's a made from seventh.

31
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,060
This is a,
is it just a bunch of different colors?

32
00:01:30,061 --> 00:01:30,894
Sevens,
yeah.

33
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:32,720
To make the artwork and this 
sweatshirts,

34
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:36,530
the death squad seven 11 shirt.
Why seven though?

35
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,120
And I know it came from the jre from a 
long time ago.

36
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,290
I Dunno.
I Dunno where,

37
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:41,880
I have no idea why.
Imagine,

38
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:43,283
imagine if that's proof.
If like people look back on this and 

39
00:01:45,901 --> 00:01:48,570
they realize they're,
there really is a simulation.

40
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:53,070
You tap into it by make,
you can make things happen with your own

41
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:53,904
brain.

42
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,140
I think the older I get,
the more crazy I get.

43
00:01:57,141 --> 00:01:58,520
Cause I've believe it more,
you know,

44
00:01:58,521 --> 00:02:00,530
like I start feeling like I'm,
I go crazy sometimes.

45
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:01,523
I don't necessarily think it's crazy.
I think it's crazy to think that it's 

46
00:02:04,921 --> 00:02:07,680
impossible that it's a simulation.
It was like,

47
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,390
just think about what we're doing.
Right.

48
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,900
Just think about the uh,
just just if no one was in his room,

49
00:02:12,901 --> 00:02:15,570
but us just for,
obviously we're doing a podcast,

50
00:02:15,571 --> 00:02:17,280
but if no one was in this room other 
than us,

51
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:18,803
we're looking at each other through our 
eyeballs with thinking about it inside 

52
00:02:23,221 --> 00:02:24,054
of our brains.
We're assuming that we're all operating 

53
00:02:26,851 --> 00:02:30,360
in the same area.
I'm assuming you see what I see.

54
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:34,440
I'm assuming like what I think of as the
reality around you is what you,

55
00:02:34,441 --> 00:02:37,830
but I have zero evidence other than 
photos and again,

56
00:02:37,831 --> 00:02:41,310
I'm looking at those photos and my 
interpretation of those photos.

57
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:44,070
Who knows what you're saying.
I have no idea what you're saying.

58
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,073
Then we're dealing with language,
trying to formulate words that match 

59
00:02:50,161 --> 00:02:52,170
your thoughts and they almost never do.

60
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,573
Like that's one of the number one 
problems that people have with 

61
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:56,370
politicians.
Right?

62
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:57,653
We know in some weird way that their 
words and their thoughts are not in 

63
00:03:01,511 --> 00:03:02,344
sync.
Like we want your words and your 

64
00:03:04,031 --> 00:03:07,690
thoughts to be in sync,
but it's fucking hard to do man.

65
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,673
It's like one of the unspoken things 
about being a person is how fucking 

66
00:03:12,251 --> 00:03:13,084
difficult it is to get your thoughts to 
come out the way you're feeling them 

67
00:03:17,591 --> 00:03:20,650
with your words.
It's very hard to do.

68
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,513
You can make something that's so,
so eloquent and with the UV articulate 

69
00:03:26,501 --> 00:03:27,334
and it would be amazing to read and it's
a quote that people might have on their 

70
00:03:30,371 --> 00:03:32,530
fucking instagram page for the next 
decade,

71
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:33,783
but did it really represent what you 
were thinking or was it just a clever 

72
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:41,950
collection of words that strikes in 
effect?

73
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,233
So when people are just talking,
not nothing like reading someone's 

74
00:03:45,161 --> 00:03:47,260
writing or something,
but just talking like,

75
00:03:47,261 --> 00:03:50,380
man,
it's fucking hard to get your brain like

76
00:03:50,381 --> 00:03:53,500
what's coming out of your brain to be 
represented by your voice.

77
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:59,140
That alone is way weirder than the fact 
that this is all fake.

78
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,720
That's way weirder than a simulation.
Right?

79
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,570
Just communicating just shit we totally 
take for granted.

80
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:07,960
Then the fact that you could do it 
online,

81
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,333
I mean how many he's fucking dudes have 
these youtube channels and gals have 

82
00:04:12,011 --> 00:04:12,844
these youtube channels with have fucking
millions of people paying attention to 

83
00:04:15,761 --> 00:04:18,970
them.
And it seems like for the most part,

84
00:04:18,971 --> 00:04:21,040
like Hollywood hasn't even figured it 
out yet.

85
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,800
Like they've dabbled in MP,
they've given people shows like that.

86
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:25,390
Adam ruins everything guy.
Right.

87
00:04:25,391 --> 00:04:26,770
He was a youtube pass.
Oh Great.

88
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,740
He's fantastic.
It's funny fucking show too.

89
00:04:29,741 --> 00:04:32,830
He's really good at it and he's a Gamer.
He twitches all the time.

90
00:04:32,831 --> 00:04:36,370
And he said he's on a marathon the other
day watching it.

91
00:04:36,371 --> 00:04:38,230
But then there's other people that are 
bad,

92
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,633
like the guy from yesterday that that 
was a thrown off the delta airline and 

93
00:04:43,301 --> 00:04:44,134
it happened with that.

94
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,890
He said,
here's what happened.

95
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:50,200
And then we found out that he's done 
this before he goes,

96
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:54,170
he pretty much goes on airplanes and 
trolls and he,

97
00:04:54,171 --> 00:04:57,790
he uh,
he counts in Arabic like 10,

98
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:59,170
nine,
eight,

99
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:02,230
seven and does shit like that.
And he's done it before.

100
00:05:02,231 --> 00:05:03,064
There's videos of him doing it before 
say pretty much just freaks everybody 

101
00:05:05,531 --> 00:05:05,861
out.
Like,

102
00:05:05,861 --> 00:05:07,980
why is this guy counting down?
You know?

103
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:08,823
It's like if anyone was on an airplane 
and counting down and would still be 

104
00:05:11,531 --> 00:05:12,460
weird.
Yeah.

105
00:05:12,461 --> 00:05:13,294
We need to like for pranks we need to 
figure out like what's a prank and what 

106
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:21,250
is fucking with people's lives for a 
short amount of time.

107
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,300
Yeah.
Cause the only,

108
00:05:22,301 --> 00:05:26,520
the only way like it goes legit is if 
the people of good nature and at the end

109
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,030
the,
they sign off on a release.

110
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:28,760
Right?
Right.

111
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,120
They'll sign off on a release for 
youtube videos as well.

112
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,700
If there's any money at attached to it,
I would say yes,

113
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:35,110
but I'm not a lawyer.
I wonder.

114
00:05:35,111 --> 00:05:36,610
Yeah,
I wonder how that works.

115
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:39,940
But when you're scaring the shit out of 
people like that on a plane,

116
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:42,010
like you could really fuck with their 
head.

117
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:43,140
Like,
yeah.

118
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:48,010
I mean I know you're a young fucking 
crazy guy who's fearless,

119
00:05:48,011 --> 00:05:51,310
who does those kinds of videos and you 
think it's funny,

120
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:54,160
but you got to realize it might be like 
some grandma behind you.

121
00:05:54,161 --> 00:05:56,620
There might be a five year old girl.
There might be,

122
00:05:56,621 --> 00:05:58,070
you know,
dude who

123
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:02,510
has like some serious tension issues.
It's not nice.

124
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:03,351
You know,
it's,

125
00:06:03,351 --> 00:06:07,070
it's not funny enough for,
for us to accept that.

126
00:06:07,071 --> 00:06:07,904
It's like,
but these boundaries get tested 

127
00:06:09,471 --> 00:06:11,120
sometimes by,
you know,

128
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:15,110
really in a lot of ways,
brave performers.

129
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,140
It's a brave thing to do.
It's not smart.

130
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,140
It's not a good thing to do.
It's not thoughtful,

131
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,900
but two,
it's hard to do that.

132
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:24,913
It's hard to go on a fucking plane and 
start counting down from 10 and Arabic 

133
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:30,650
and hope that nobody beats you to death 
before you,

134
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,371
you know,
you say,

135
00:06:31,371 --> 00:06:32,420
Hey,
I'm just fucking around.

136
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,660
Just a youtube video.
But it's awesome.

137
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:37,660
Gross as fuck.
When you sell it at yourself as like,

138
00:06:37,661 --> 00:06:38,680
oh my God,
they,

139
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,570
they're doing this to me.
They're so racist.

140
00:06:40,571 --> 00:06:42,540
When you're kind of,
you're,

141
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,320
you're trying to get that,
you know,

142
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:48,130
you're baiting them and you've got proof
that you've done it before.

143
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:49,720
Yeah.
That's not cool.

144
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,220
It's gross.
That's gross.

145
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,730
But we're talking about it.
So he wins.

146
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,780
I mean really man,
it just seems like people want to figure

147
00:06:59,781 --> 00:07:01,430
out a way to get in,
you know?

148
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,380
And uh,
there's so many people,

149
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:04,214
like we were talking about like that 
Adam Guy are so many other ones that 

150
00:07:06,531 --> 00:07:11,531
have just a giant segment of the viewing
population already.

151
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:12,733
You know,
there's a lot of these channels that 

152
00:07:13,551 --> 00:07:14,384
people have that people are just 
addicted to like listening to these 

153
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:16,874
people talk about shit and for you to 
try to break in and make your own 

154
00:07:20,931 --> 00:07:22,730
channel.
It's a,

155
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:23,900
it's weird,
right?

156
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:27,620
It's like there's still people that are 
doing it and then the network way,

157
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:30,440
there's still shows that are on network 
television that,

158
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:34,430
that work like that there prank shows 
and shit like that.

159
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,700
Most of them are fake luckily,
you know,

160
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:39,510
on Youtube and even in real life or 
they're,

161
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:40,510
they're,
you know,

162
00:07:40,511 --> 00:07:41,800
fake reality,
whatever,

163
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:44,850
where they're half real.
You see too much these days.

164
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,103
Like there's too much coming in.
I watched this guy sucker punch of 

165
00:07:49,021 --> 00:07:50,880
Grandma,
Oh God,

166
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,103
a video where this old lady was behind 
this young dude and she was apparently 

167
00:07:55,561 --> 00:07:58,500
bothering him.
And so he turns,

168
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:02,670
there are other cash register line,
he turns and sucker punches or a full on

169
00:08:02,671 --> 00:08:03,504
in the face.
It just knocks her dead and she falls 

170
00:08:05,461 --> 00:08:08,430
back and no one does anything about it.
It's really weird.

171
00:08:08,431 --> 00:08:09,264
The cashier freezes up.
The guy behind her who's an old guy 

172
00:08:12,121 --> 00:08:15,750
freezes up and this no one knows what to
do.

173
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:18,630
It's weird.
I shouldn't have seen it.

174
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,450
I was like,
why do I,

175
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:20,283
why?
Why do I want to know if there's a 

176
00:08:21,451 --> 00:08:22,284
circumstance where some young guy feels 
like he gets sucker punched some looks 

177
00:08:25,051 --> 00:08:27,270
like 80 year old lady and I'm not 
kidding.

178
00:08:27,271 --> 00:08:30,600
She's like white haired and,
and it doesn't look fake.

179
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:33,530
It's not that Shit's the shit that bugs 
me the most.

180
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,540
And it's just,
it's just these kids now,

181
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,370
you know,
you know,

182
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:38,180
they,
they have no parents.

183
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,280
I saw,
I saw bieber the other day,

184
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:44,060
had a horrible incident with Bieber and 
it was one of the worst things.

185
00:08:44,061 --> 00:08:47,720
I wish I'd never saw my life cause I 
used to always kind of like root for him

186
00:08:47,721 --> 00:08:48,471
a little,
you know,

187
00:08:48,471 --> 00:08:51,110
like he seemed like a nice guy,
especially after the roast.

188
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:54,170
He seemed like a cool guy down to earth.
But man,

189
00:08:54,171 --> 00:08:55,004
how he treated this old guy and like how
he was treating the staff of this place 

190
00:08:58,771 --> 00:08:59,604
I was at.
It was one of the worst things I ever 

191
00:09:01,981 --> 00:09:02,814
saw.
It I had to leave normal me would be 

192
00:09:04,531 --> 00:09:05,364
recording,
Oh let's take settle this tmz or do 

193
00:09:07,111 --> 00:09:09,000
something crazy like that.
It was so gross.

194
00:09:09,001 --> 00:09:10,170
I just wanted to get out of there.

195
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,920
I deleted all my tweets walk cause I was
live tweeting.

196
00:09:13,921 --> 00:09:14,754
Why was there a beginning?
But then it got so bad that I just 

197
00:09:16,261 --> 00:09:20,280
deleted all my tweets and I was like,
then he yelled at me and it,

198
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:23,550
cause I had this dolphin hat on and he 
goes,

199
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,380
hey,
you like dolphins man,

200
00:09:25,381 --> 00:09:28,230
you love dolphins bro.
And like doing shit like that to me.

201
00:09:28,231 --> 00:09:30,220
And I'm just like,
I go,

202
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,190
yeah,
I like the fuck dolphins dude.

203
00:09:32,191 --> 00:09:35,040
Like I just start yelling at him.
I went crazy.

204
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,590
He got a little crazy right there.
Yeah,

205
00:09:36,591 --> 00:09:38,730
yeah,
true story.

206
00:09:38,731 --> 00:09:39,564
And you could ask my girlfriend when he 
like he got quiet after that for like 

207
00:09:41,731 --> 00:09:42,564
three minutes.
And then like the table of guys that he 

208
00:09:44,281 --> 00:09:46,740
was with were just staring at me and 
when I was walking out,

209
00:09:46,741 --> 00:09:49,440
he just screams all of garden.
True story,

210
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,760
I promise you.

211
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,710
Okay.
So now I'm like,

212
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,770
does he know who I am?
And that's why he was fucking with me.

213
00:09:56,070 --> 00:10:00,270
Did he find out who I was after I yelled
at him and he shut up or what?

214
00:10:00,271 --> 00:10:01,104
But we're live with that question.
I don't want to ever know the answer to 

215
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:09,120
that question.
But the horrible thing about it was that

216
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:11,910
it,
he was really treating people like shit.

217
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:14,730
Like that's super unfortunate to hear 
him.

218
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:18,030
This old guy was staring down like,
please don't talk to me anymore.

219
00:10:18,031 --> 00:10:20,010
Please don't talk to me.
Like you could tell he was just,

220
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:23,993
what is he like 21 or something.
And I know I didn't even think it was 

221
00:10:25,711 --> 00:10:26,544
him.
We thought it was like 14 year old kids 

222
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,050
for like the first half of the time we 
were there.

223
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:32,310
We were like,
wait a second,

224
00:10:32,311 --> 00:10:33,540
that tattoo,
it looks familiar.

225
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,480
Then I was googling Justin bieber back 
of his neck.

226
00:10:36,481 --> 00:10:37,440
Don't ever do.
That's gross.

227
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,573
And then,
and then it was the exact same tattoos 

228
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,150
like wings and like this like weird 
writing.

229
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:43,051
I was like,
Holy Shit.

230
00:10:43,051 --> 00:10:43,884
That really is him.

231
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,090
Hmm.
How many people,

232
00:10:48,091 --> 00:10:50,040
and this is a legitimate honest 
question,

233
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:51,203
how many people have ever gone through 
the fire of becoming famous when you're 

234
00:10:54,811 --> 00:10:56,790
young and come out?
Okay.

235
00:10:57,210 --> 00:11:00,870
Has Anybody Jodie foster?
Right.

236
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:03,450
But I don't know her.
She might be crazy as fuck.

237
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:06,120
Right?
She's a really good acts as a cutter.

238
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:08,850
She knows man.
Who knows?

239
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,890
She was really famous,
really young.

240
00:11:10,891 --> 00:11:13,170
Like how old was Jodie foster in taxi 
driver?

241
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:18,210
I want to go like super young.
I want to go like teenage years.

242
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:21,330
19 I'd say 19 what would you say?
Oh,

243
00:11:21,331 --> 00:11:25,820
1550 wow.
She played a 12 year old.

244
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:28,260
She was 13 when the movie premiered.
Holy Shit.

245
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,670
Wow.
Shit.

246
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:32,590
Holy Shit.
She's laid a prostitute at the tender.

247
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:33,443
Oh my God.
Jesus fucking Christ and know that it's 

248
00:11:37,231 --> 00:11:38,160
true,
dude.

249
00:11:38,161 --> 00:11:41,520
They made their play a prostitute at 12 
years old.

250
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:48,840
What a mind fuck that must be.
You can't do that anymore,

251
00:11:49,111 --> 00:11:50,940
right?
No,

252
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,690
you can't do that anymore.
Do you remember in that Movie Cape Fear?

253
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,760
Yeah,
that's her dude.

254
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:57,993
That's insane.
You remember in that Movie Cape Fear 

255
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:07,020
when Robert Deniro had a,
what was her name?

256
00:12:07,391 --> 00:12:08,920
Juliette.
Juliette Lewis.

257
00:12:08,921 --> 00:12:10,420
Yeah.
Suck his fingers.

258
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,780
Wasn't that in that movie?

259
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:16,623
I don't know.

260
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:20,650
Was that that movie Maya?
Just a freak might just making shit up.

261
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:25,740
I F I have this vague memory of some 
really weird twisted seduction scene.

262
00:12:26,581 --> 00:12:27,770
Yeah.
She's sucking his finger.

263
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:29,260
Yeah.
Yeah.

264
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:34,120
Little cross eyed almost dude fucking 
bangs

265
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,753
dude.
How old was she was supposed to be like 

266
00:12:38,861 --> 00:12:43,780
seven to 17 she was 17 when he did this.
Oh my God.

267
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:46,930
So that's the locally when it says 
that's what it says.

268
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,980
Oh Daily Mail.
Okay.

269
00:12:47,981 --> 00:12:48,814
They wouldn't lie.
17 year old even shared a kiss and a 

270
00:12:52,301 --> 00:12:54,370
thumb sucking and the scene.
What to know?

271
00:12:54,371 --> 00:12:55,204
That's dark dude.
Cause Dinero had to be like deep in his 

272
00:12:57,881 --> 00:13:02,881
forties then that's weird.
17 that should be illegal.

273
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,140
That's a loophole.
Yeah,

274
00:13:05,141 --> 00:13:07,540
that's a loophole.
It just,

275
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:10,180
because it's in a movie,
like you can't fuck that kid.

276
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:14,800
Like probably say you probably shouldn't
have a 17 year old sucking your thumb.

277
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:15,933
But my point was that like this was a 
long time ago and we didn't look at 

278
00:13:19,721 --> 00:13:22,050
things the same way a long time ago as 
we do today.

279
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:22,993
It's more evidence that there's some 
weird gigantic shift in the way people 

280
00:13:26,411 --> 00:13:31,411
are recognizing and understanding the 
consequences of things like child abuse,

281
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,630
you know,
or things like that.

282
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,430
Man,
that's weird.

283
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:39,123
I saw a creepy guy at the mall the other
day looking at the cub scouts or boy 

284
00:13:41,981 --> 00:13:44,140
scouts did.
They were wrapping presence.

285
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,420
Maybe he just used to be a boy scout 
himself.

286
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,490
Well the asked for the days it was 
limber.

287
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,400
I would say the same thing if it wasn't 
rubbing his dick against the railing.

288
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,220
He sure.
Yeah.

289
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,083
Maybe just barely get stand up.
How he was three stories up and just 

290
00:13:58,241 --> 00:14:00,350
rubbing his dick left and right on this 
railing,

291
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:03,330
staring straight down.
Did you hear about the security guard at

292
00:14:03,331 --> 00:14:04,920
the NFL game the other day?
No.

293
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,040
Caught on video jacking off to a 
cheerleader right in front of them.

294
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:10,180
Oh,
Jesus.

295
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,430
Watch this video.
It's fucking crazy.

296
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,211
Oh No,
no,

297
00:14:13,211 --> 00:14:13,730
no,
no.

298
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:16,300
See in his pants he said,
I believe it.

299
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:18,790
I've seen too much.
I've seen too much.

300
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,490
I don't need to see that.
I've seen too much.

301
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,520
Jesus Christ right in the middle of 
everyone.

302
00:14:24,521 --> 00:14:28,150
There's people like so crazy.
It must be just getting his rocks off in

303
00:14:28,151 --> 00:14:30,670
the biggest way possible.
I'm off the freak.

304
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:34,870
What a security guard.
Fucking what a world dude.

305
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:37,060
I wonder if that's a real yeah,
again,

306
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,700
but it's real.
So my thought was that this,

307
00:14:39,701 --> 00:14:41,440
um,
this bebe kid,

308
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,540
you know,
I mean,

309
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,730
has anybody ever gone,
well,

310
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:48,040
I guess people have gone through that 
and become more friendly,

311
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:50,680
but I had a friend of mine,
or just worked with another dude who was

312
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:51,514
famous the time he was young and they 
did a television show together and it's 

313
00:14:54,321 --> 00:14:55,154
just like,
whoa,

314
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,280
they have this.
He was like,

315
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:00,890
I think that someone who grows up 
famous,

316
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:03,410
unless you're like some really cool 
person that figures it out,

317
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:04,783
they have this attitude that everyone's 
supposed to just like them and that 

318
00:15:07,881 --> 00:15:10,160
they're like above everyone else.

319
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:11,203
They have this idea in their head that 
it's almost impossible to break if 

320
00:15:15,351 --> 00:15:18,170
you've known that your whole life,
your whole life from tom or little,

321
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,300
everybody's treating you like you're 
super spreadsheet without,

322
00:15:20,301 --> 00:15:21,134
you really have an earn it so much.
The casio kind of earn it with your 

323
00:15:25,671 --> 00:15:27,800
talent,
you know?

324
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,900
That's a very talented,
well,

325
00:15:29,901 --> 00:15:30,734
how about like Ricky Schroeder,
who's my friend who was famous when he 

326
00:15:35,181 --> 00:15:36,470
was really,
really,

327
00:15:36,471 --> 00:15:39,050
really young silver spoons?
Yeah.

328
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,390
Riding a train,
had an arcade game in his house.

329
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:42,290
Did.
He was in that movie,

330
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:43,124
the champ.
I watched that when I was a little kid 

331
00:15:44,841 --> 00:15:48,590
and made me cry.
That was a harsh movie.

332
00:15:48,591 --> 00:15:53,570
He was fucking good man.
Like anybody that gets famous,

333
00:15:53,571 --> 00:15:54,404
that young has a crazy challenge in 
front of them for like figuring out 

334
00:15:59,871 --> 00:16:03,440
life.
I couldn't imagine that beaver kids been

335
00:16:03,441 --> 00:16:04,640
famous since he was like,
what?

336
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,680
12 or something?
And to be honest,

337
00:16:06,681 --> 00:16:10,250
he was 21 year old drunk like yeah,
blackout drunk.

338
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,110
He was that drunk.
He was that drunk.

339
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:15,620
Well,
think about how fucked up you get.

340
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:19,340
Oh yeah.
When you're full 42 and imagine.

341
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,980
But I've never been like a,
almost like a bully,

342
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:25,280
like yelling.
He was yelling at people instead of like

343
00:16:25,281 --> 00:16:27,050
don't leave me alone.
And then being a dick,

344
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:27,913
he was actually looking and yelling and 
pointing out people and talking shit 

345
00:16:30,681 --> 00:16:34,580
about the restaurant and you know,
it's fine.

346
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,370
Anyways,
all those things,

347
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,570
the alcohol,
that's a big factor for sure.

348
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,370
Being a boy.
Yeah,

349
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:41,813
no,
this is the thing about being dudes 

350
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,950
being the dude is a lot like having a 
car,

351
00:16:45,951 --> 00:16:48,380
a car that's just like a little too fast
for the road.

352
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:53,060
Like you're always pushing it like that.
That's what being a dude is.

353
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:53,953
You know,
especially guys growing up around a 

354
00:16:54,861 --> 00:16:58,550
bunch of other guys,
they're all competing wrestling and shit

355
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,110
out,
dude in each other.

356
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,370
I like.
It becomes,

357
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:04,600
if they feed off of each other people,
you know,

358
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,593
people feed off each other and men don't
have enough outlets for natural male 

359
00:17:08,841 --> 00:17:11,630
behavior you just told you shouldn't 
think like that.

360
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:12,950
You shouldn't be like that.
You know?

361
00:17:12,951 --> 00:17:15,080
You should be more aware,
be more kind.

362
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:16,453
That's all nice and you're right 100% 
but you got to deal with the fucking 

363
00:17:20,241 --> 00:17:21,074
biology of your body.
Your body wants to smash shit and fuck 

364
00:17:23,211 --> 00:17:25,040
things.
It's what it's built for.

365
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,143
And so if you don't feed it,
if you don't give it some sort of 

366
00:17:28,341 --> 00:17:30,650
exertion,
it's going to play tricks on you.

367
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:34,100
It's going to over ramp stressful 
situations.

368
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,530
Gonna make you more upset at things more
easy.

369
00:17:36,531 --> 00:17:39,170
It's going to make you more prone to 
getting pissed off in traffic.

370
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:42,560
All those things like that has to be 
addressed.

371
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:43,394
Like people have to figure that out.
You can't just ask boys to just be be 

372
00:17:49,171 --> 00:17:50,180
better.
Just,

373
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,033
you know,
you've got to give them like some sort 

374
00:17:51,481 --> 00:17:53,820
of biological tools.
And this,

375
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:56,370
this,
I will obviously I wasn't there,

376
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,140
you know,
and if I was there,

377
00:17:58,141 --> 00:18:02,550
I probably would have had probably the 
same problems with it that you did,

378
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,220
but I can't imagine being that fucking 
kid.

379
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,920
Yeah.
I can't imagine being that girl.

380
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:09,050
What's her name?
Um,

381
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:12,060
Lindsay Lohan.
She makes me sad every time I see her,

382
00:18:12,061 --> 00:18:13,920
she makes me sad.
I see those pictures.

383
00:18:13,921 --> 00:18:14,754
I'm like,
this poor kid is fucking swimming in 

384
00:18:16,621 --> 00:18:20,400
space with no connector.
It's just like she's gone.

385
00:18:20,401 --> 00:18:25,401
She's a part of this giant machine of 
movies and TV and publicity and fame and

386
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:30,960
covers of magazines and,
and she was a baby,

387
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:34,800
a baby when she got into it.
She didn't know shit.

388
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:37,590
And that,
that formed her whole life.

389
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:39,690
And people like,
Oh boo hoo.

390
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,070
Poor her with all her money.

391
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:43,980
Listen to me,
that money doesn't mean shit.

392
00:18:43,981 --> 00:18:45,990
If you're crazy and you're smoking 
crack,

393
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,980
it doesn't mean shit.
It doesn't mean anything.

394
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,831
Your life is hell.
Yeah.

395
00:18:49,831 --> 00:18:51,390
You don't have to worry about food.
Okay,

396
00:18:51,391 --> 00:18:53,190
so your life is hell and you don't have 
to worry about food.

397
00:18:53,191 --> 00:18:54,024
It's one notch better than you.
Life is hell and you're starving to 

398
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:56,580
death,
but it's still,

399
00:18:56,581 --> 00:19:00,660
your life is a hell.
Paris Hilton's holding it together.

400
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,033
She kind of pulled away from fame,
which might've been like a really smart 

401
00:19:05,101 --> 00:19:07,890
thing to do.
She might've like felt the repercussions

402
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:08,813
of all that hate because nobody puts 
themselves out there in a position more 

403
00:19:14,311 --> 00:19:16,410
so than someone who becomes a reality 
star.

404
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,960
You know?
Because when you become a reality star,

405
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:23,990
you're sort of admitting that you don't 
do anything right.

406
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:25,630
If you're just a reality star,
you,

407
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:26,850
you don't do anything.

408
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,020
You're not singing,
you're not reading books that you wrote.

409
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:32,880
You're not like doing public readings of
a book.

410
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:36,180
You're not doing it.
You're just being a person,

411
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,550
right?
Everybody can fucking be a person,

412
00:19:38,551 --> 00:19:39,570
man.
It's,

413
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,570
it's one thing if you have a reality 
show,

414
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,253
reality show about Kanye West.
Well that's Kinda interesting because 

415
00:19:45,511 --> 00:19:48,360
who the fuck gets to be Kanye West?
Only Kanye West.

416
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:53,370
So if it was them following Kanye round,
it would make more sense.

417
00:19:53,371 --> 00:19:55,890
But it's not,
it's them just live in their life.

418
00:19:55,891 --> 00:20:00,480
It's fucking genius and a lot of ways 
because they figured out by just kind of

419
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:05,340
like being outrageously extravagant and 
opulent with their money and uh,

420
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,740
by you know,
constantly mixing and drama.

421
00:20:07,741 --> 00:20:10,230
They'd been able to stay on TV for like 
11 fucking years.

422
00:20:10,231 --> 00:20:14,480
It's,
it's jeans and a lot of ways look at,

423
00:20:14,481 --> 00:20:17,820
ain't any worse than a lot of that 
shitty fucking shows around tv tonight.

424
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:20,850
Some terrible ass show on TV.
Why is that worse?

425
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:24,750
Cause it's,
it's terrible and no one wrote it like,

426
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,660
cause that what it is that the problem?
It's worse cause no,

427
00:20:27,661 --> 00:20:28,560
if you like,
we'll leave shifts.

428
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:30,510
You have made this up and it was 
terrible.

429
00:20:30,511 --> 00:20:32,850
It'd be all right.
Like as to why is it okay?

430
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:37,260
There's the equal level of terrible all 
over television that nobody cares about.

431
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:41,430
But we care because it's just a bunch of
people live in their life and we can all

432
00:20:41,431 --> 00:20:42,960
do that.
You know,

433
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:43,823
if you have the kind of money to come on
young Jamie hit the lotto and all of a 

434
00:20:47,951 --> 00:20:48,784
sudden got a 500 foot yacht and started 
bawling hard Dan Bilzerian style all 

435
00:20:53,981 --> 00:20:58,050
over instagram,
all the Jordans and following you with a

436
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:58,893
camera,
they could absolutely make a fucking 

437
00:21:00,911 --> 00:21:03,610
reality show about that 100%.
Absolutely.

438
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:08,740
It could be young Jamie freaking out,
complete to way too much pussy,

439
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:11,140
not knowing what to do and we have to 
pull them aside and go,

440
00:21:11,141 --> 00:21:12,960
dude,
you got to calm down so much.

441
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:13,823
Shit hit me up.

442
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:17,950
But you know what I'm saying?
I mean,

443
00:21:17,951 --> 00:21:19,960
all you have to do is create a 
circumstance,

444
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:22,180
create a circle.
If you're just a regular person,

445
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:23,140
you know,
I mean,

446
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,700
that's all they are.
They're just regular people.

447
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:25,480
They're not,
um,

448
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,313
it's not like they're working for the 
Cirque de Solei and they have this 

449
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:30,573
insane physical stuff that they have to 
do and they're working on it constantly 

450
00:21:34,091 --> 00:21:34,571
and like,
wow,

451
00:21:34,571 --> 00:21:35,740
this is fascinating.
I've never,

452
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:37,540
never thought of how they prepare for 
this.

453
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:39,580
But yeah,
you'd managing it'd be pretty rigorous.

454
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:40,443
Nope.
Nope,

455
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:42,220
nope.
Regular bitches going shopping,

456
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:48,720
eating salads like oh my God.
And I told him like what they,

457
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:49,663
the way they get around,
I just like to make a charity or 

458
00:21:51,191 --> 00:21:52,024
something,
you know,

459
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:53,360
charity.
Yeah.

460
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:55,870
Nicole Richie,
charity of small animals.

461
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:57,363
Forgotten.
There's something up on my instagram 

462
00:21:58,601 --> 00:21:59,434
page right now.
I wanted to mention this because it's 

463
00:22:00,251 --> 00:22:01,084
going on until the end of December is a,
a very cool company that makes epsom 

464
00:22:05,711 --> 00:22:06,544
salts.

465
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:07,773
If you go to fight for the forgotten,
oh actually water for orange water 

466
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,910
for.org
rather.

467
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,043
Uh,
and then forward slash fight for the 

468
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,280
forgotten boy.
That was a marble mouth delivering.

469
00:22:21,281 --> 00:22:23,440
So I'll say that again.
Water four,

470
00:22:23,441 --> 00:22:24,880
the number four.
So water,

471
00:22:24,881 --> 00:22:25,714
the number four.org.
That's the organization that Justin 

472
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,033
Wren,
our friend works with and Justin is 

473
00:22:31,691 --> 00:22:36,550
building wells in the Congo.
He's fucking beautiful person.

474
00:22:36,551 --> 00:22:37,384
But anyway,
they raised a ton of money so far and 

475
00:22:39,581 --> 00:22:42,520
it's going to provide clean water to a 
lot of people.

476
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:45,700
Um,
water for.org

477
00:22:45,701 --> 00:22:48,910
forward slash fight for the forgotten is
it really?

478
00:22:48,911 --> 00:22:53,410
100% beautiful story.
That guy's an amazing person.

479
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:54,723
And what he's done I think is just,
it's so selfless and loving and 

480
00:22:58,931 --> 00:22:59,764
inspiring.
And I think people like him doing shit 

481
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:03,731
like that.
Oh,

482
00:23:03,731 --> 00:23:04,564
I'm gonna cry.
People like him doing shit like that 

483
00:23:06,041 --> 00:23:07,330
literally can change the world.

484
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:09,610
That guy,
Justin wren can change the world just by

485
00:23:09,611 --> 00:23:11,650
being so loving and caring.
I mean,

486
00:23:11,651 --> 00:23:16,330
he goes down there and spend months and 
months at a time and the Congo and he's,

487
00:23:16,331 --> 00:23:19,270
he's gotten malaria three fucking times.
I mean,

488
00:23:19,271 --> 00:23:20,104
he's like,
he keeps getting it and he's going to 

489
00:23:21,701 --> 00:23:22,181
be,
I mean,

490
00:23:22,181 --> 00:23:25,180
it's still like the racking his body.
He doesn't give a fuck.

491
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,300
Such a beautiful person,
man.

492
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:31,560
And he's a heavyweight fighter for Bella
tour and the whole things can,

493
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:33,850
he used to fight in the UFC.
He's a fucking animal.

494
00:23:33,851 --> 00:23:35,500
I mean,
he's just such a freaky dude.

495
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:37,660
It's like you meet people like that and 
you know,

496
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:39,130
Oh,
I guess I'm a piece of shit.

497
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:42,700
I've just,
I'm not that Nice.

498
00:23:42,701 --> 00:23:44,530
I'm not going to the Congo.
I'll send you some money,

499
00:23:44,531 --> 00:23:46,340
man,
but I'm not going to the fucking Congo.

500
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,810
I'm not getting malaria.

501
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:48,431
Um,
no,

502
00:23:48,431 --> 00:23:51,560
I can't really,
at least I hope I don't.

503
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,480
But anyway,
um,

504
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:54,823
I don't know how we got on that.
I stone text you that you should work 

505
00:23:57,621 --> 00:23:59,060
with big brother.
Do you remember that?

506
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:00,063
Oh,
well let me explain this though because 

507
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,220
I just remembered.
So all of it's,

508
00:24:04,221 --> 00:24:08,960
I guess all the profits for the whole 
month of December go to this.

509
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:10,910
So if you buy epsom salts from these 
people,

510
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:14,690
um,
episode episode,

511
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,860
that's the company eap soak.
I use epson salts all the time.

512
00:24:18,861 --> 00:24:20,420
First of all,
from my isolation tank.

513
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,850
Second of all,
just a nice hot bath.

514
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:24,103
It feels really good.
It's really good for your body and it 

515
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:29,120
helps your body absorb magnesium.
You absorb magnesium through your skin.

516
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,170
You can,
you know,

517
00:24:30,171 --> 00:24:31,940
with this,
with epsom salt baths,

518
00:24:31,941 --> 00:24:32,930
really good for him,
man.

519
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,990
Get a gargle too.
Like after massage parlor,

520
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,610
what you,
what are you doing?

521
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:38,810
Blowing guys?
The massage.

522
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:42,170
Pawn the fuck dude.
But um,

523
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:44,480
the uh,
epsom salt baths,

524
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,910
uh,
or like super underrated man.

525
00:24:46,911 --> 00:24:48,350
If you've got like some tension and 
shit,

526
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,950
throw some epsom salts in the tub.
Just kind of,

527
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,550
Ooh,
Ooh.

528
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:53,870
I don't know why.
Right.

529
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:56,600
Have you flood it lately?
I have it in my basement.

530
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:59,990
I now floating mother fucker.
Dude.

531
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:02,060
It's where figure shit out.
Probably too much.

532
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:04,340
I'm trying.
I'm thinking too much for sure.

533
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,370
I think about too many different things.
Um,

534
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:08,330
so,
uh,

535
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:11,840
I'm trying to narrow my focus more.
That's one of the reasons why I cut back

536
00:25:11,841 --> 00:25:13,700
in the UFC.
I was like,

537
00:25:13,701 --> 00:25:15,260
I'm narrowing my focus.
I think,

538
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:16,873
you know,
just trying to do things that I think 

539
00:25:18,651 --> 00:25:21,950
are a,
that I'm compelled to do,

540
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:23,330
you know?
Absolutely.

541
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,493
You seem like you've been enjoying 
outside stuff more like archery and 

542
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,060
stuff like that.

543
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,040
Hunting.
We'll do it that come from,

544
00:25:31,041 --> 00:25:33,050
cause you never had that before.
I know.

545
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:35,930
Well,
it came from the first time I did it for

546
00:25:35,931 --> 00:25:39,170
first time I went hunting and was 
successful and I was like,

547
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:40,250
oh,
okay.

548
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,840
I get it now.
Like this is,

549
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:42,920
oh,
this is nuts.

550
00:25:42,921 --> 00:25:46,730
Like what a crazy thing to do.
And it's also in a weird,

551
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:47,623
odd way,
there's a helplessness that you feel 

552
00:25:51,261 --> 00:25:52,094
when you were in nature that I think is 
very almost psychedelic because like 

553
00:25:56,001 --> 00:25:59,180
when you go and you not even now like 
hunting,

554
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,073
um,
I'm just talking about go to a place 

555
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:04,190
where there's no cell phone signal at 
all.

556
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:08,450
Go deep into the woods and you will feel
vulnerable as fuck.

557
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,210
You feel vulnerable and then you start 
thinking,

558
00:26:11,211 --> 00:26:13,010
Holy Shit,
there's bears out here.

559
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:15,830
There's fucking mountain lions out here 
for real.

560
00:26:15,831 --> 00:26:17,930
Like I'm in there where they live.

561
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:21,450
This is where they live.
This isn't like a mountain lion in Santa

562
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:22,490
Monica on some,
you know,

563
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:24,140
freak incident.
This is like,

564
00:26:24,141 --> 00:26:27,440
you're going to where they live and 
people don't live.

565
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:30,430
What's your hunting tech game like?
Do you have like night vision goggles?

566
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,570
Like all the coolest stuff so you can 
see the bear?

567
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:34,640
I don't have anything.
Well you don't go out at night.

568
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:37,550
The only thing you do at night,
it's like stay around the camp,

569
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:40,450
stay around the campfire.
But this even nights,

570
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,293
weird man,
we had a deer come into our camp once 

571
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:44,340
and uh,

572
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,173
in the middle of the night and then 
realize it was around people and he 

573
00:26:46,711 --> 00:26:48,940
starts stomping on the ground and 
hoofing.

574
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,900
It was weird.
I barely heard it.

575
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:52,763
The other guys had to remind me of it,
but it's just animals do come into 

576
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,480
people's tents.
Bears do.

577
00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:01,380
That's what gets scary is big bears,
especially when they're starving.

578
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:05,010
Big bears that are starving.
We'll take some fucking chances.

579
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:09,180
And one of [inaudible] friends,
he his first hunt ever,

580
00:27:09,181 --> 00:27:12,870
he was attacked in his tent by a 500 
pound predatory black bear.

581
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,273
His friend shot the bear and hit him.
So shot him in the wrist and then the 

582
00:27:18,961 --> 00:27:21,420
bear ran out of that tent,
ran into another tent.

583
00:27:21,421 --> 00:27:26,421
He's shot at in the other tent,
a 500 pound predatory black bear.

584
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:31,590
Just the,
just the power that that thing possesses

585
00:27:31,591 --> 00:27:36,540
is so beyond any of our comprehension.
Like when you see their bodies,

586
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,630
you see a bear's body and you think of a
500 pound bear.

587
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,020
What this thing would have 500 pound dog
could do to you,

588
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:44,160
right?
Just think of that,

589
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:46,380
right?
A 500 pound dog then,

590
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:50,550
have you ever seen like a baby bear 
wrestle a dog?

591
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:54,270
It's fucking hilarious.
They,

592
00:27:54,271 --> 00:27:58,260
it's like Habib Neuroma,
madoff wrestling your grandmother.

593
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:03,630
This bear just throws this fuck dog 
around like at eight shit.

594
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:06,990
It's a little cub as a little baby bear.
Look,

595
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:08,850
look at this.
Look the,

596
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,050
the dog keeps fucking with them.
The bears way smaller.

597
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,440
Them the bears like,
all right,

598
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:15,060
pitch.
You want to get crazy?

599
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:15,960
All right,
let's get crazy.

600
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:21,380
So they start going to war and the bear,
the bear whips him to the ground.

601
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:22,920
They can put,
the dog keeps fucking with it.

602
00:28:22,921 --> 00:28:23,760
Look at this.
Boom,

603
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:24,330
look at,
hey,

604
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:25,980
we have some around.
Wow Dude.

605
00:28:25,981 --> 00:28:26,814
He just throws him around.
He's way smaller than that dog and the 

606
00:28:29,161 --> 00:28:30,030
dog is like,
oh no,

607
00:28:30,031 --> 00:28:30,810
what have I done?

608
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:31,650
Look at this.
Boom,

609
00:28:31,651 --> 00:28:32,910
bitch,
boom.

610
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,780
Side control like the bear can do shit 
that dog can't do.

611
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:37,614
The doc had only bite,
but that bear has ridiculous power in 

612
00:28:40,421 --> 00:28:42,420
those arms.
Show that last 15 seconds.

613
00:28:42,421 --> 00:28:43,320
Again,
look,

614
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:46,690
he throws him,
he uses his hips like look,

615
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:51,210
go back a little bit.
This bear is like a fucking judo champ.

616
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:52,643
Like lunch.
This is like some Cairo per easy and 

617
00:28:53,801 --> 00:28:54,631
shit.
Look,

618
00:28:54,631 --> 00:28:56,520
boom.
He just throws him around.

619
00:28:56,521 --> 00:28:59,790
Boom.
Seriously stocky.

620
00:28:59,791 --> 00:29:02,180
Rex throws him around.
That bail is,

621
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:05,090
that's like Daniel cormier that bear,
he was his,

622
00:29:05,091 --> 00:29:08,280
his hips man,
like instinctively uses his hips.

623
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:13,170
And now imagine one of those that's 500 
pounds and wants to eat.

624
00:29:13,171 --> 00:29:16,500
You.
Imagine what the fucking sheer terror of

625
00:29:16,501 --> 00:29:19,710
that would be.
So that's not a good explanation for why

626
00:29:19,711 --> 00:29:22,560
I like to do it,
but I like to do it just cause it's um,

627
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,210
it's nature.

628
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:27,960
I think it's like a fucking vitamin.
I think it's like a battery.

629
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,310
I think it's like a,
uh,

630
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:33,000
uh,
an experience that once you tap into it,

631
00:29:33,001 --> 00:29:33,834
just being out there in nature,
it makes you understand what life is 

632
00:29:38,521 --> 00:29:39,354
better.
It makes you understand the world 

633
00:29:40,171 --> 00:29:41,004
better.
It,

634
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:41,973
you understand this.
Just the fact that this is just some 

635
00:29:44,651 --> 00:29:49,651
weird living patch that's on the surface
of a planet mean the all the,

636
00:29:51,041 --> 00:29:51,874
all those things like need to get 
exposed to you and like chunks in order 

637
00:29:54,581 --> 00:29:59,170
for you to really truly absorb it.
Like you could see like Mount Everest or

638
00:29:59,171 --> 00:30:00,004
some shit.
You could see it in a video and you're 

639
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:02,351
like,
wow,

640
00:30:02,351 --> 00:30:03,184
pretty cool,
but I don't think you're really seeing 

641
00:30:04,901 --> 00:30:06,370
it.
I think that's bullshit.

642
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:10,450
I think you're just seeing it all the 
flat image,

643
00:30:10,451 --> 00:30:14,740
a lifeless flat image.
But if you were there and you could take

644
00:30:14,741 --> 00:30:16,060
it all in and you're,
you're,

645
00:30:16,061 --> 00:30:21,061
I understand the perspective and you get
the immense nature of what you're,

646
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:25,450
you're in front of this fucking insanely
huge mountain,

647
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:28,270
then I think you'll,
you'll experience it until you,

648
00:30:28,271 --> 00:30:30,220
until you go there.
I bet you don't feel it.

649
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,370
So I think that's the same with that.
You know,

650
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:36,670
it's like seeing a band that you don't 
think is that awesome.

651
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,350
But then you see them live and you're 
like,

652
00:30:38,351 --> 00:30:40,240
holy shit man,
they fucking killed it.

653
00:30:40,241 --> 00:30:41,710
Like Chicago rules.
Yeah,

654
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:46,920
no data.
But one of my first nights when we,

655
00:30:52,811 --> 00:30:54,100
uh,
we first went camping,

656
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:56,320
I was almost immediately aware of it.
I was like,

657
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:57,154
wow,
this is a totally different feeling out 

658
00:30:58,391 --> 00:31:00,460
here.
Like you,

659
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:01,503
when you're in a city,
you feel like we're all kinda like 

660
00:31:05,111 --> 00:31:06,640
pretty relaxed.
Like,

661
00:31:06,641 --> 00:31:08,290
this is where we live.
You know?

662
00:31:08,291 --> 00:31:08,890
Hey,
uh,

663
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:10,210
you want to meet for lunch?
Yeah.

664
00:31:10,211 --> 00:31:11,650
What do you want to go?
Let's go to that spot.

665
00:31:11,651 --> 00:31:12,610
Okay.
Is it on Ventura?

666
00:31:12,611 --> 00:31:13,444
Yeah,
let's go,

667
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:14,930
you know,
norm on Blah,

668
00:31:14,931 --> 00:31:15,271
blah,
blah,

669
00:31:15,271 --> 00:31:16,104
blah,
blah.

670
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:18,040
There's nothing like that.
When you're in the woods,

671
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,840
when you're in the woods,
everywhere you're walking,

672
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:20,611
you're like,
okay,

673
00:31:20,611 --> 00:31:21,940
there's a bear over there.
No,

674
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:23,440
there's a mount mine over here.
No.

675
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:24,940
Is it deer over there?
No.

676
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:27,340
Like where are the life forms?
Where the lifeforms,

677
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,233
where's the ones that I want to eat and 
where's the ones that might want to eat 

678
00:31:29,951 --> 00:31:30,490
me?

679
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:32,170
Where are these fucking things 
stressful?

680
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:34,360
It's very stressful,
but beautiful.

681
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:35,733
It's beautiful.
It's not stressful in that like you're 

682
00:31:37,181 --> 00:31:41,830
not really worried constantly of bears,
but they're fucking real,

683
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,570
like,
bears aren't a myth.

684
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:45,003
The real,
you know you're going and you know 

685
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:50,980
you're going to where they live.
Mountain lions are real.

686
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:52,570
They're real.
I mean,

687
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:57,620
there's a giant fucking species.
It's a giant cat to 150 pound cat.

688
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:02,170
It lives in the forest and kill Shit 
every day.

689
00:32:02,171 --> 00:32:04,510
It's an expert at killing shit and it's 
as big as you.

690
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,660
And if you've run into it,
you might be fucked.

691
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:08,823
He might not be,
but tell us like some Damon that was 

692
00:32:11,381 --> 00:32:12,214
like some demon that got summoned here 
from another world and most of the time 

693
00:32:16,241 --> 00:32:20,530
it only eight deer and only consumed 
dear to keep itself alive.

694
00:32:20,531 --> 00:32:23,530
But every now and then,
every now and then it's snatches up.

695
00:32:23,531 --> 00:32:24,364
A school child just pulls,
pulls it kid out of a fucking one of 

696
00:32:29,891 --> 00:32:30,724
those little swing sets and hops over 
the fence with it before anybody can do 

697
00:32:33,581 --> 00:32:36,730
anything.
Like holy shit that happens,

698
00:32:36,731 --> 00:32:37,564
man.

699
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:40,340
There was this video I saw yesterday 
where this girl found

700
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:42,080
this like baby bunny.
She's like,

701
00:32:42,081 --> 00:32:43,430
oh my gosh,
it's so cute.

702
00:32:43,431 --> 00:32:44,264
And she's like petting it.
She put it down and the second she puts 

703
00:32:46,191 --> 00:32:47,024
it down,
this bird just comes out of nowhere and 

704
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:49,780
picks it up and now hawk,
Hawk,

705
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:51,680
Hawk and jacked it.
It's fucked up.

706
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:53,203
You see the one where they got the night
vision of the owl flying in and Jack in 

707
00:32:56,001 --> 00:32:57,110
the hawk?
No,

708
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:59,540
we think it's a hawk.
We don't know what it is.

709
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,150
Might be a pigeon.
I don't know shit about birth people.

710
00:33:02,151 --> 00:33:03,130
Mike,
Joe Rogan.

711
00:33:03,131 --> 00:33:04,820
Todd Todd was a hawk.
There's a,

712
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:09,100
so it's a night vision and uh,
let's take a security cam and as the,

713
00:33:09,101 --> 00:33:09,934
the owl flying in,
you see its eyes closer and closer and 

714
00:33:12,381 --> 00:33:15,470
closer.
And then check this out.

715
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:18,440
Watch this.
I look off in the distance.

716
00:33:18,441 --> 00:33:19,700
See that?
Those are the eyes.

717
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:21,050
Oh Wow.
Watch it.

718
00:33:21,051 --> 00:33:22,520
Call Man.
Look at this dude.

719
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:24,440
Wow.
Watch this.

720
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:26,720
Boom.
Holy Shit.

721
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,900
Now what kind of bird is that?
Look at it liquid to look at its face.

722
00:33:29,901 --> 00:33:32,000
It kind of looks like a raptor,
right?

723
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,000
Might Be Falcon.
Right?

724
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:35,923
You know what though?
It might just be because it's night 

725
00:33:37,041 --> 00:33:39,020
vision.
It doesn't have that big of a beak.

726
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:40,190
What do you think it is,
Jamie?

727
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,230
Maybe some sort of or,
Huh?

728
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:46,250
It seems like a,
yeah,

729
00:33:46,251 --> 00:33:47,660
it seems like a raptor,
right?

730
00:33:47,661 --> 00:33:48,494
Like right there that looks like a 
murderous little bird so that he got 

731
00:33:51,771 --> 00:33:54,890
murdered by another murderer,
that his eyes are for each other.

732
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,880
But watch how he gets him to,
he kicks him.

733
00:33:56,881 --> 00:33:58,270
He gets low.
Bam.

734
00:33:58,390 --> 00:33:59,223
So crazy dude.
The power that those things have and 

735
00:34:01,431 --> 00:34:04,160
their jaws are in their claws rather.
You mean?

736
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:05,023
I don't,
I don't think there's a way you could 

737
00:34:07,731 --> 00:34:10,190
ever understand what it would be like to
have a giant hand.

738
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,473
Like it's probably as strong as like a 
person's hand and it's underneath the 

739
00:34:14,481 --> 00:34:18,740
bird and it's got knives on the end of 
it and they just slots.

740
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:22,940
Imagine if you had some Bass Freddy 
Kruger clause and that's what you do.

741
00:34:22,941 --> 00:34:25,640
Just grab things and squish him.
Punched through him.

742
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:31,790
I mean think about how fucking Bananas 
Flying Raptors are.

743
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,620
They're just big enough where they can't
kill us.

744
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,100
Judge big enough.
Just a little too small.

745
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:43,850
She'll little too small to kill us.
But if eagles could kill us,

746
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,950
like if eagles,
like the sides of buses,

747
00:34:45,951 --> 00:34:49,820
we'd be fucks.
Ville would've never invented the wheel.

748
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:51,980
They would just jacked us and 
extinction.

749
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:55,340
We'd be hiding in little holes in the 
fucking hills,

750
00:34:56,390 --> 00:35:00,920
would try to find anti eagle technology.
That would be our number one concern.

751
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,920
Kill the eagles.
Do.

752
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:06,590
That's a dragon is a dragon.
Who knows,

753
00:35:06,591 --> 00:35:08,870
man,
maybe there were bigger raptors and they

754
00:35:08,871 --> 00:35:10,580
killed him off.
Holy Shit.

755
00:35:10,581 --> 00:35:13,220
There was,
there was one from New Zealand,

756
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:15,440
there was that.
We've talked about this.

757
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,453
I feel like fairly recently I read 
something about this and I might have 

758
00:35:18,111 --> 00:35:19,670
brought it up,
but there was a rat.

759
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,460
Yeah we did.
There's an eagle in New Zealand,

760
00:35:22,461 --> 00:35:24,860
I think it's called the Haas Eagle or 
something like that,

761
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:25,993
but it's,
it was fucking enormous and people 

762
00:35:28,731 --> 00:35:30,950
killed it off and it lived in New 
Zealand.

763
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,670
I think it had something ridiculous like
a 14 foot wingspan.

764
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:35,930
Wow.
And they,

765
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:38,160
they do think that it's entirely

766
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,290
possible that think this thing killed 
people.

767
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:43,020
That's one of the reasons why the New 
Zealand people killed it off.

768
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:45,660
Cause it was like in the 14 hundreds or 
some shit.

769
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:47,610
They killed it off.
You find anything on it?

770
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:49,063
Yeah,
they think that there's a video of a 

771
00:35:50,691 --> 00:35:52,860
Golden Eagle snatching a kid.
Okay.

772
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,253
That's fake.
But they were thinking it was one of 

773
00:35:55,281 --> 00:35:58,220
those eagles black what people were and 
weren't sure if it was fake or not.

774
00:35:58,370 --> 00:36:00,530
Oh.
So when people weren't sure it was fake,

775
00:36:00,531 --> 00:36:03,110
they thought maybe it was like a few of 
those things still left in the wild.

776
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:05,780
But it's in New Zealand.
Right.

777
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:09,260
That was that video from New Zealand to,
and that's what this is like a debunking

778
00:36:09,261 --> 00:36:09,980
video.
Oh,

779
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,930
geographic about it.
But it talks about those eagles.

780
00:36:11,931 --> 00:36:14,990
I'm trying to find some stats on it.
Speaking of debunking,

781
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:17,630
did you hear all the crazy shit that's 
going on with the snopes,

782
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:20,570
but you know that website snopes,
you're always thinking,

783
00:36:20,571 --> 00:36:21,404
well this is where like really 
reasonable website and for sure you 

784
00:36:24,621 --> 00:36:26,330
know,
if I go to them they'll have the answer.

785
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:30,080
The people own it or fucking freaks.
Matt for sure.

786
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,610
Do you know the story?
No.

787
00:36:31,611 --> 00:36:35,240
I don't know.
I guess his wife and married a porn star

788
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:38,590
who is a,
also a escort,

789
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,280
an online escort.
Who is,

790
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,233
what's her name?

791
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,980
I don't know dude.
This is,

792
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:44,743
this is the guy apparently just divorced
his wife and started bawling out of 

793
00:36:48,351 --> 00:36:49,220
control.
He got it.

794
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:52,640
I got a bunch of cash and decided to 
marry this Gal.

795
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:53,660
And now,
uh,

796
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,393
but as a,
there's also like some anti Bush stuff 

797
00:36:57,650 --> 00:37:00,170
about this too.
It's like someone,

798
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,550
someone in that group was involved in 
uh,

799
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:04,610
some,
um,

800
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:09,650
anti Republican fundraising type 
activity or something along those lines,

801
00:37:09,651 --> 00:37:10,484
right?
Wasn't it,

802
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:11,953
you know,
Jamey,

803
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:14,203
what does it say I'm looking at anyway,
point is these just is just people like 

804
00:37:18,381 --> 00:37:22,310
everybody has been saying that there's 
this democratic lean towards the truth,

805
00:37:22,311 --> 00:37:25,220
like editorializing the truth on some of
those sites like snopes.

806
00:37:25,221 --> 00:37:28,580
Like how much of this is like you,
are you absolutely sure,

807
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:30,950
like how am I,
how you've done a little bit of research

808
00:37:30,951 --> 00:37:34,850
and come to your own conclusions.
Like how like vetted is this stuff,

809
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,860
who's in charge and then you find out,
well,

810
00:37:36,861 --> 00:37:40,490
this is the people in charge.
These people are just freaks balling out

811
00:37:40,491 --> 00:37:42,080
of control.
Marian hookers.

812
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,190
Did they find this out?
The facebook fake news thing happened.

813
00:37:46,191 --> 00:37:46,950
Is that it?
Yes,

814
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:47,783
because those people were part of the 
team that was supposed to clean up the 

815
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:51,534
fake news.
And then there's a new thing that was 

816
00:37:54,031 --> 00:37:54,864
supposed to be out today as a new tool 
that they think is going to be able to 

817
00:37:58,171 --> 00:37:59,490
figure out fake news.

818
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,920
We're fucked.
It's awful.

819
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:05,340
We're Fox folks.
People could just make shit up.

820
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:07,430
Did you see that crazy times?
Uh,

821
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,830
adobe released photoshop for sound.
I don't know if he saw this video and or

822
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,820
shopping for sound,
but what it can do is it can take,

823
00:38:14,821 --> 00:38:16,410
like,
you can just say one sentence,

824
00:38:16,411 --> 00:38:18,120
like,
I love Tacos.

825
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,111
Oh,
we showed that.

826
00:38:19,111 --> 00:38:19,944
We talked about it.
Didn't have a good clip to find it 

827
00:38:21,781 --> 00:38:23,100
because it didn't come up at the right 
time,

828
00:38:23,101 --> 00:38:23,600
but,
well,

829
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,200
we had a pretty decent clip.
There was one,

830
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,840
we showed a sentence.
It was pieced together from other stuff.

831
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:28,920
Yeah,
man.

832
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:29,753
Do you think that's been available 
before they've announced this to the 

833
00:38:31,891 --> 00:38:34,410
public on this big giant announcement 
party?

834
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:35,530
Oh yeah.
Right.

835
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:36,070
I would

836
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:38,650
imagine that that's the kind of 
technology that you would take.

837
00:38:38,651 --> 00:38:41,980
It would take a long time to work on.
But are you saying like is it being used

838
00:38:41,981 --> 00:38:44,230
by nefarious sources?
I didn't sit in a farrier,

839
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,073
but I mean it's not there yet.
You know what I think about all that 

840
00:38:46,751 --> 00:38:47,281
stuff,
the,

841
00:38:47,281 --> 00:38:48,400
those,
that kind of thinking.

842
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:53,530
I think that technology is improving so 
quickly and I don't,

843
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:54,364
I don't necessarily think that the 
people who are working for the u s 

844
00:38:57,161 --> 00:38:57,994
government are the ones that are 100% in
control of the information to get that 

845
00:39:01,481 --> 00:39:02,314
gets released.
Like these people that are constantly 

846
00:39:04,001 --> 00:39:07,240
innovating and creating all these new 
products and these new technologies,

847
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:09,160
they're not all working for the 
government.

848
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:10,030
They're just not.
Right.

849
00:39:10,031 --> 00:39:13,330
So this idea that like the government 
has some stuff way before we do.

850
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,060
Probably not today.
No.

851
00:39:16,061 --> 00:39:16,894
Today I think it's a fucking river 
filled with salmon that are covered in 

852
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:23,860
baby oil and you can't grab one of these
motherfuckers in there.

853
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,570
Whoa.
They're flying by you.

854
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:28,450
That's what I think.
I think shit's changing so quick,

855
00:39:28,451 --> 00:39:29,284
so fast that that's why all these leaks 
and all these different things that 

856
00:39:32,201 --> 00:39:37,120
pertain to elections and changing 
people's ideas are happening so quickly.

857
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,513
Like I don't even know if we understand 
how nutty this is while it's happening 

858
00:39:41,981 --> 00:39:43,970
to us.
That's what that is.

859
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:47,830
That's what the fake the new tool to 
visualize how fake news is spread.

860
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,410
Oh,
the tool to visualize how it's spread.

861
00:39:50,411 --> 00:39:52,030
Yeah.
It's spread to Republicans.

862
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:52,650
You know?
It is.

863
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:54,580
It's like South Park.
They retweet stuff.

864
00:39:54,581 --> 00:39:57,400
They don't vet the soda from Democrats 
do.

865
00:39:57,401 --> 00:40:00,460
Everybody does it.
It's like there was a,

866
00:40:00,461 --> 00:40:01,294
there was an article recently that said 
that people who are conservative are 

867
00:40:03,641 --> 00:40:05,680
much more likely to be fooled by fake 
news,

868
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:10,090
but it was probably written by liberal,
so who the fuck knows?

869
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:11,343
Is it weird to you that Alex Jones seems
like he's blown the fuck up in the last 

870
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:15,610
couple of years?
It's not weird.

871
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:20,560
Like my mom knows who Alex Jones is now.
It's weird.

872
00:40:20,561 --> 00:40:21,394
People think that I'm somehow ducking 
him that I don't want to have him on my 

873
00:40:23,681 --> 00:40:24,514
podcast.
I would love to have Alex on my 

874
00:40:25,241 --> 00:40:26,440
podcasts.
People don't know.

875
00:40:26,441 --> 00:40:28,960
Like I have a very good relationship 
with Alex Jones.

876
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:30,790
I love him.
He's my friend.

877
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:33,550
I hug him every time I see him,
I'm happy to see him.

878
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:38,200
I liked that guy a lot and he's crazy 
and he's not all crazy,

879
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:40,570
but he's crazy.
But he's a good guy telling you.

880
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:42,970
He's like,
Alex Jones is a great fucking guy.

881
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,830
He stresses though.
Oh yeah,

882
00:40:44,831 --> 00:40:46,210
he's freaks.
He freaks.

883
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:49,000
You know he needs a guy like me right 
next to him all the time.

884
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:51,640
That's what it needs.
Like Alex Jones needs someone to go,

885
00:40:51,641 --> 00:40:52,474
Alex,
Oh God.

886
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,093
Are you sure that the elites are going 
to kill everybody off so they can live 

887
00:40:55,781 --> 00:40:57,070
forever?
Are you fucking sure?

888
00:40:57,130 --> 00:40:58,690
Because if you not sure he got to stop 
saying it.

889
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:02,370
You know he needs someone that's right 
there.

890
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:07,460
Like I really think the problem with 
like conspiracy theories is they feel so

891
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,110
good.
They feel great.

892
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,660
Like when you,
you think you really have footage of the

893
00:41:12,661 --> 00:41:14,250
loch ness monster.
Holy Shit.

894
00:41:14,251 --> 00:41:15,084
You feel good.
It doesn't matter if nobody wants to 

895
00:41:17,161 --> 00:41:20,430
blow me when I get to work,
I'm going to rock the world.

896
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:21,623
You know?
I think people who a are constantly 

897
00:41:24,301 --> 00:41:27,870
searching for conspiracies.
Everywhere you go like man,

898
00:41:27,871 --> 00:41:31,290
like talk about being like sucked into 
the plot.

899
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:34,100
Like you're,
it's all you're on is

900
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:34,933
people who are lying in conspiring to 
make money or kill half the population 

901
00:41:39,111 --> 00:41:40,370
or whatever the fuck it is they're 
doing.

902
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:46,670
What are you sure this is it an 
attractive thought pattern.

903
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:48,890
That's the problem.
When these God conspiracies,

904
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:50,053
they're attractive thought pro patterns 
that mimic like real problem solving 

905
00:41:55,641 --> 00:41:56,474
that could benefit you in real life.
So instead of like actually paying 

906
00:42:00,741 --> 00:42:01,574
attention to your real life,
you get sucked into this idea of you 

907
00:42:04,761 --> 00:42:08,450
being the one who's going to figure out 
who killed JFK and you ride that fucking

908
00:42:08,451 --> 00:42:09,284
thing 12 hours a day all day long and in
the and then after a while like are you 

909
00:42:13,401 --> 00:42:14,234
a researcher or you just a dude has gone
crazy paying attention to the JFK 

910
00:42:18,501 --> 00:42:19,580
assassination.
Like which,

911
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:23,240
which one are you?
You've got to be careful because this,

912
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:28,400
this feeling that you get when you chase
down secrets and conspiracies,

913
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,620
the government deal,
Illuminati,

914
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:32,510
we're going to expose this man.

915
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:33,410
It's,
it's,

916
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:34,243
it gives extra and exaggerated meaning 
to your time and anything that gives 

917
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,633
extra and exaggerated meaning to your 
time should be closely considered as to 

918
00:42:44,331 --> 00:42:45,164
whether or not it's beneficial.
Like if something gives you extra and 

919
00:42:48,591 --> 00:42:52,280
exaggerated feelings,
you got to go well is this love?

920
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:54,980
Is this a hot girl?
I like the fuck.

921
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:59,750
Is it a a fun sport that I picked up the
now I'm addicted to like what is it any,

922
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:03,080
how much of this is good and how much of
this is chem trails?

923
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:04,663
You know,
how much of this is just you just 

924
00:43:06,261 --> 00:43:10,280
spending a lot of time on something that
turns out to be total nonsense.

925
00:43:11,330 --> 00:43:14,210
How much?
I like micro conspiracies way better.

926
00:43:14,211 --> 00:43:16,000
Like little things like you know like 
the,

927
00:43:16,001 --> 00:43:18,440
like if you could add a value meal at 
Mcdonald's,

928
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:19,753
it's a more expensive than if you buy 
all three things separately and stuff 

929
00:43:22,551 --> 00:43:23,384
like that.

930
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:25,100
That's true.
That's true too.

931
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:27,053
If you get a value meal at Mcdonald's,
you can add more expensive than if you 

932
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:32,030
put all the things together.
Really?

933
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:35,360
Yeah.
But those kinds of conspiracies you just

934
00:43:35,361 --> 00:43:37,570
broke that broke that story.
I'm,

935
00:43:37,571 --> 00:43:38,404
it's going to be giant.
Does kind of conspiracies to are to me 

936
00:43:40,461 --> 00:43:43,520
are way funding it because you can prove
it easier.

937
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:44,940
Right,
but that's not a conspiracy.

938
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,570
Conspiracy's like doing it.
What?

939
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,340
Why are they doing that?
Do they know about it?

940
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:50,293
Oh,
there must be some incentive to get 

941
00:43:53,661 --> 00:43:57,320
people when you get it as a package,
you would,

942
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:01,850
what I would say is if there's a meal 
package that's less money,

943
00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:03,163
it might still be more money than they 
would have spent if they didn't go for 

944
00:44:06,351 --> 00:44:09,710
the meal package.
So they might only get one thing.

945
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:12,590
They might only get a burger and maybe 
only get a drink.

946
00:44:12,591 --> 00:44:15,170
But if you offer some things in a 
package of times,

947
00:44:15,171 --> 00:44:17,120
people are going to gravitate towards 
that packet.

948
00:44:17,121 --> 00:44:19,010
You right.
You're saying that it's a way to upsell.

949
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:19,911
Yeah.
So,

950
00:44:19,911 --> 00:44:22,880
even though it might cost less to buy it
as a package,

951
00:44:22,881 --> 00:44:23,714
they still might be spending more than 
they would a split if they didn't buy 

952
00:44:26,241 --> 00:44:28,580
the package because they might've just 
got a cheeseburger by itself.

953
00:44:28,610 --> 00:44:29,630
Oh,
that's totally legit.

954
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,760
Yeah.
And it's 41 600

955
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:35,610
marketing x was awesome.
And they add the 41 sentence that's like

956
00:44:35,611 --> 00:44:39,360
buying the extended warranty.
I don't think you need that.

957
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:43,770
Mcdonald's sued because extra value 
meals,

958
00:44:43,771 --> 00:44:47,190
41 cents more.
Wow.

959
00:44:47,191 --> 00:44:50,040
I wonder how much I'm going to spend on 
legal fees and that conundrum.

960
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:52,860
How could you get sued for that?
You didn't mean unless you said,

961
00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:56,280
I mean the fucking price is on the wall.
You dumb cunt.

962
00:44:56,310 --> 00:44:58,900
Cause it's called extra value meal 
meaning values.

963
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:01,010
It's like kind of false advertising.
A little,

964
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:02,220
I guess.
Is it?

965
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:04,950
I guess frog,
he's just a lawsuit.

966
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:09,680
The lawsuit filled this month was a file
this month was about principle,

967
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:10,603
not 41 cents.
He seeks a class action status for 

968
00:45:13,281 --> 00:45:14,114
consumer fraud and deceptive practices.
Lawsuit Against Mcdonald's operator 

969
00:45:17,211 --> 00:45:18,850
Charisse management.
Huh?

970
00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:24,620
I love that Mcdonald's exists,
but it should be illegal.

971
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:26,750
Why?
It's fucking barely food,

972
00:45:26,751 --> 00:45:27,800
man.
I had it the other day.

973
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:29,060
Okay,
that's fucking great.

974
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:32,090
I don't know what you're talking about.
I know two men.

975
00:45:32,091 --> 00:45:34,670
Every now and then I'll stop on the way 
home and get a filet of fish.

976
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:35,583
Oh,
the fries.

977
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:38,490
See,
I don't fuck with fries.

978
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:40,470
Not that much.
A little bit here and there,

979
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:45,270
but they don't get me those filet a fish
has get me the fish fresh.

980
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:48,580
You have to have a fresh one.
But I made the mistake before eight,

981
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:52,560
the last one watching a fucking 
documentary on how they prepare those,

982
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:57,420
those fish cakes that you buy,
that fucking Jesus Christ.

983
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,850
It's the other.
They treat all the fish with chemicals.

984
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:00,893
They remove all the smell.
That's why when you eat like filet of 

985
00:46:03,441 --> 00:46:05,490
fish,
they never fucking smell.

986
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:08,790
They don't smell right.
You ever have dude,

987
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:12,870
I hate you ever catch a fish and cook it
like later in the day.

988
00:46:13,290 --> 00:46:15,570
But if you wait too long,
it starts to stink.

989
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:17,550
You know?
Especially if it's in the sun.

990
00:46:17,730 --> 00:46:18,563
Like you gotta be careful with fish 
fishes awake way different than any 

991
00:46:20,641 --> 00:46:21,474
other like food in that.
The closest proximity you have to that 

992
00:46:25,561 --> 00:46:28,500
thing being caught and then killed and 
then you eat it.

993
00:46:28,501 --> 00:46:32,420
The closer those are together,
it makes us a giant impact on the way it

994
00:46:32,421 --> 00:46:33,330
felt.
It tastes.

995
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:34,853
So they figured out some weird way to 
treat all this stuff that was watching 

996
00:46:38,341 --> 00:46:42,060
them do it there.
They kill so many fish do.

997
00:46:42,061 --> 00:46:42,894
It's crazy.
If you watch like one of them filet a 

998
00:46:44,951 --> 00:46:48,690
fish factory places and you see the fish
is being poured in,

999
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:51,420
you just want to go stop,
stop,

1000
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:52,680
stop,
stop.

1001
00:46:52,681 --> 00:46:53,280
It

1002
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,720
zig a mass murder.
You can't take any more fish.

1003
00:46:55,750 --> 00:46:58,330
There's not going to be any more fish.
Oh my God.

1004
00:46:58,331 --> 00:47:00,160
What are they doing?
That's hilarious dude.

1005
00:47:00,161 --> 00:47:01,930
It's crazy.
They just have trucks.

1006
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:02,793
They're backing it up.

1007
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:07,930
Dumping gigantic piles of fish in there.

1008
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:09,530
Well think about chickens man.
You,

1009
00:47:09,531 --> 00:47:12,460
you got a Boston market.
I've just got a half a chicken,

1010
00:47:12,850 --> 00:47:13,683
you know,
and that.

1011
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:15,100
Yeah,
and that's a half of life.

1012
00:47:15,101 --> 00:47:18,310
I just ate and it was alive probably 
once a month ago.

1013
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:21,190
Yeah.
That's so much chicken.

1014
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:22,053
So much chicken.
It doesn't make the people were there 

1015
00:47:23,111 --> 00:47:26,260
before you relation theory thing makes 
more sense.

1016
00:47:26,261 --> 00:47:28,210
Cause there's no way there was that much
chicken,

1017
00:47:28,211 --> 00:47:29,420
you know,
here's,

1018
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:29,980
here's what's

1019
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,360
going on.
Where we,

1020
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:35,560
we have decided that we operate better 
and calmer and gigantic groups.

1021
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:38,110
And even though like there's more 
stress,

1022
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:40,660
I mean by better and calmer,
like as a civilization,

1023
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:44,800
like there's more bp punk,
honk fuck you,

1024
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:45,663
maybe more murder or maybe more crime 
because everybody's jammed on top of 

1025
00:47:48,551 --> 00:47:49,384
each other.
So you're going to have a bunch of like 

1026
00:47:49,751 --> 00:47:54,751
errant behavior no matter what you do.
But the only way we can do that as if we

1027
00:47:55,211 --> 00:47:58,990
are not involved at all in the 
production of food.

1028
00:47:59,140 --> 00:47:59,973
So the production of food is kind of 
taken away from people because we all 

1029
00:48:02,051 --> 00:48:03,970
together,
if we lived in a neighborhood,

1030
00:48:03,971 --> 00:48:07,240
right?
Say if I lived near you and you know,

1031
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:08,103
Joey's up the street and you know,
burt's up the street and we all decide 

1032
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:11,350
with,
it's like a,

1033
00:48:11,351 --> 00:48:12,430
uh,
you know,

1034
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:15,040
like a co op and we're going to grow our
own food.

1035
00:48:15,130 --> 00:48:16,450
I mean that's,
people have done that before.

1036
00:48:16,451 --> 00:48:18,280
Hippies do that shit all the time.
They love to do it.

1037
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:19,623
Um,
if we had them all stacked on top of 

1038
00:48:21,041 --> 00:48:22,600
each other and fucked up like that,
we'd be like,

1039
00:48:22,601 --> 00:48:23,620
hey guys,
what are we doing?

1040
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:26,470
Like this is fucked up.
Like these chickens aren't even,

1041
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:28,000
they're not even,
they're never a lot.

1042
00:48:28,001 --> 00:48:30,880
They just were just treating them like 
shit until we kill him.

1043
00:48:31,350 --> 00:48:32,800
Like that seems kind of fucked up,
right?

1044
00:48:32,930 --> 00:48:34,630
I guarantee you we'd all agree.
We don't be like,

1045
00:48:34,631 --> 00:48:35,890
yeah,
all right,

1046
00:48:35,891 --> 00:48:37,150
how do we do this better?
You know,

1047
00:48:37,151 --> 00:48:39,970
what do we need more space?
We need to treat it more humanely.

1048
00:48:39,971 --> 00:48:40,804
They needed an omnivorous diet.
They need to be able to free range and 

1049
00:48:43,451 --> 00:48:46,900
roam around and be like a real chicken 
until the end comes.

1050
00:48:47,350 --> 00:48:50,140
So it's not like a life of torture and 
then death.

1051
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:51,003
It's just life and death.
So you'll eliminate by using your 

1052
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:56,080
intellect,
you eliminate that torture.

1053
00:48:56,081 --> 00:48:57,850
But the thing is,
we don't encounter it,

1054
00:48:57,851 --> 00:48:59,530
man.
You know?

1055
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:01,330
Have you ever been to a slaughterhouse?

1056
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:02,770
No.
I W deaf.

1057
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,850
Um,
maybe I have maybe a cow.

1058
00:49:05,890 --> 00:49:06,481
No,
no,

1059
00:49:06,481 --> 00:49:07,590
I haven't.
No.

1060
00:49:07,591 --> 00:49:08,424
I,
I went to a place where they milk cow a 

1061
00:49:09,111 --> 00:49:09,944
farm.
But

1062
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:11,880
yeah,
that's even rough man.

1063
00:49:12,270 --> 00:49:16,000
Those cows jammed up against those metal
bars and then they're uh,

1064
00:49:16,090 --> 00:49:18,390
they're yanking on their tits like,
oh yeah,

1065
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:20,610
this is a,
it's all weird,

1066
00:49:20,611 --> 00:49:22,560
man.
It's all weird because we don't see it.

1067
00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:25,830
Like we just go get milk.
That's the fucked up part.

1068
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:26,933
We've created these systems and go get 
milk is not nearly as fucking weird is 

1069
00:49:30,601 --> 00:49:33,510
go get a cheeseburger at Mcdonald's,
cause go get a cheeseburger.

1070
00:49:33,511 --> 00:49:36,660
It's like they've done all the work.
They grew the cow that killed the cow.

1071
00:49:36,661 --> 00:49:38,310
They chopped it up,
they grounded up,

1072
00:49:38,311 --> 00:49:39,810
they cooked it,
they put it on a bun,

1073
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:40,793
they wrapped that Bun and paper that 
gave it to you and it took a couple of 

1074
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:44,800
seconds.
I mean,

1075
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,970
you can go to a Mcdonald's right now.
You pull up that drive through,

1076
00:49:47,971 --> 00:49:50,340
get a juicy as quarter pounder with 
cheese.

1077
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:51,913
Ooh.
And it'll be in your fat fucking greasy 

1078
00:49:53,791 --> 00:49:55,740
mouth and three minutes.

1079
00:49:56,250 --> 00:49:57,083
That's amazing.
Is the only way that can happen is if 

1080
00:49:59,101 --> 00:50:02,190
you're not involved in the process is 
the only way it can happen.

1081
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:06,330
Like we kind of kill a lot of fucking 
cows to do that.

1082
00:50:06,331 --> 00:50:07,164
You can't,
we can't all be like everybody who eats 

1083
00:50:08,701 --> 00:50:11,850
cow be out there killing cows.
We wouldn't get shit done.

1084
00:50:11,970 --> 00:50:12,803
There would be no insurance companies.
There would be no video games that ever 

1085
00:50:15,511 --> 00:50:17,070
get developed.
We wouldn't have time.

1086
00:50:17,370 --> 00:50:20,250
We'd be out there fucking mowing fields 
and shit.

1087
00:50:20,490 --> 00:50:21,323
We'd be out there shooting cows in the 
head and hanging them up by their 

1088
00:50:23,371 --> 00:50:23,950
ankles,

1089
00:50:23,950 --> 00:50:26,650
fake foods on the way very soon I think.
I mean,

1090
00:50:26,651 --> 00:50:28,070
especially since recently they've

1091
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:31,370
had a lot of good breakthroughs from 
like growing food,

1092
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:31,911
you know?
Yeah.

1093
00:50:31,911 --> 00:50:34,040
That's 100% gonna happen.
And once that happens,

1094
00:50:34,041 --> 00:50:34,874
it's going to be interesting to see if 
they just like have like one year of 

1095
00:50:36,891 --> 00:50:37,724
like last year to have real counts,
slaughter them all and just keep like 

1096
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:43,310
one cow per county or something.
They're doing this style.

1097
00:50:43,970 --> 00:50:44,803
Like,
you know how Peter Kills a lot of cats 

1098
00:50:45,621 --> 00:50:47,960
and dogs?
I tell people that and they go,

1099
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:49,010
what?
Yeah,

1100
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:49,873
Peta euthanizes a lot of cats and dogs.
Unfortunately they say they don't have 

1101
00:50:53,391 --> 00:50:57,470
the money to keep them alive.
Just hi irony in a,

1102
00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:00,920
in a way that the,
is that the ethical treatment of animals

1103
00:51:00,921 --> 00:51:02,000
that kill him,
like,

1104
00:51:02,170 --> 00:51:03,780
like there's no way,
like they're,

1105
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:07,950
they have no kill animal shelters in la 
where they don't kill the animals,

1106
00:51:08,130 --> 00:51:08,963
take them in,
they try to find them a home like 

1107
00:51:09,811 --> 00:51:11,250
squeaky member.
My Docs Wiki,

1108
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:12,353
she was in there for like six months or 
something crazy and callen founder and 

1109
00:51:16,861 --> 00:51:20,040
then I adopted her.
But um,

1110
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:22,050
yeah,
I don't know ma'am.

1111
00:51:23,370 --> 00:51:24,203
I think our relationship to life itself,
going back to what you were asking me 

1112
00:51:26,701 --> 00:51:27,534
about the forest,
our relationship to life itself is very 

1113
00:51:30,301 --> 00:51:32,070
disjointed.
I think.

1114
00:51:32,071 --> 00:51:32,904
Um,
we were raised by people who were 

1115
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:36,833
brainwashed by the 1960s [inaudible] 
1970s media and movies and TV shows and 

1116
00:51:42,001 --> 00:51:43,260
whatever they learned from their 
parents.

1117
00:51:43,261 --> 00:51:44,580
You got to think of who their parents 
were.

1118
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:46,980
Their parents were fucking immigrants.
Man.

1119
00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:48,443
I mean,
my grandparents came straight from the 

1120
00:51:50,131 --> 00:51:51,330
boat,
all of them,

1121
00:51:51,870 --> 00:51:52,650
all of them.
My,

1122
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:54,480
my mom's side,
all of them.

1123
00:51:54,481 --> 00:51:57,030
On my father's side,
my father's side,

1124
00:51:57,031 --> 00:52:00,030
half from Ireland,
the grandfather was from Ireland,

1125
00:52:00,031 --> 00:52:01,710
grandmother was from Italy,
everybody else,

1126
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:05,070
Italy,
they all came over here on a boat.

1127
00:52:05,430 --> 00:52:09,120
They all just took a fucking Jan's it.
They didn't know shit dude.

1128
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,820
And there's no way they would have 
prepared you for the Internet.

1129
00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:13,223
They just didn't know.
So it's like with every passing 

1130
00:52:15,271 --> 00:52:19,170
generation will become more and more 
aware of how weird this thing is,

1131
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:20,273
which is why he can't have a movie with 
Robert Deniro was sucking on Juliette 

1132
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:24,510
Lewis,
you know,

1133
00:52:24,570 --> 00:52:26,880
tits.
He can't do that today,

1134
00:52:27,150 --> 00:52:28,230
right?
I don't think so.

1135
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:29,393
No.
Back then you could do it because they 

1136
00:52:30,301 --> 00:52:33,060
didn't know any better.
I mean literally didn't know any better.

1137
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:34,193
You know,
like when people talk about like Roman 

1138
00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:36,211
Polanski,
mom Rome,

1139
00:52:36,211 --> 00:52:38,430
clamp clamp,
see what he did.

1140
00:52:38,610 --> 00:52:39,443
He had sex with a 13 year old girl and 
he drugged her and all that said 

1141
00:52:42,330 --> 00:52:44,130
there's,
there's never an excuse for that.

1142
00:52:44,131 --> 00:52:44,964
Right.
He's a piece of shit for sure for doing 

1143
00:52:46,711 --> 00:52:47,544
that.
Right.

1144
00:52:48,210 --> 00:52:53,210
But that when during that time,
like way back then,

1145
00:52:53,970 --> 00:52:54,803
I bet.
I bet that was way more common than we 

1146
00:52:57,901 --> 00:52:58,680
would like

1147
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:00,210
Marlin Brando.
Yeah,

1148
00:53:00,830 --> 00:53:01,663
that's shit that just recently came out.
How that was supposedly a real rape 

1149
00:53:04,561 --> 00:53:07,650
scene in that movie.
Last tango of something.

1150
00:53:07,651 --> 00:53:10,920
I Dunno right now will was that girl?
Uh,

1151
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:12,893
I don't know.

1152
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:13,913
She was like 17 or 18.
Like she wasn't told that she was going 

1153
00:53:15,771 --> 00:53:17,310
to do that.
They just did it to her.

1154
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:18,180
Yeah.
Yeah.

1155
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:22,350
Twat the fuck man.
It's a different world back then.

1156
00:53:22,470 --> 00:53:23,303
Oh well we,
we've talked about this a couple of 

1157
00:53:24,121 --> 00:53:26,310
times about how go to those 1950s

1158
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:27,810
movies.
Men always hit women.

1159
00:53:28,410 --> 00:53:30,180
The fucking hit them all the time.
Sean connery,

1160
00:53:30,181 --> 00:53:31,760
you remember that interview?
He did.

1161
00:53:31,761 --> 00:53:32,594
Yeah.
That's one of my favorite interviews 

1162
00:53:33,721 --> 00:53:35,610
ever.
We played that recent.

1163
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:36,260
Wow.
Really?

1164
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:38,100
Yeah.
With Barbara Walters,

1165
00:53:38,110 --> 00:53:38,943
if you haven't heard it folks,
you should go listen to it on youtube 

1166
00:53:41,731 --> 00:53:44,520
cause it's Barbara Walters.
She thinks she has him.

1167
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:45,833
That's one of the,
one of the interesting things about it 

1168
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:48,233
is that she brings up that he has said 
that sometimes it's okay to hit a woman 

1169
00:53:51,630 --> 00:53:53,970
and she sticks it to him like,
you know,

1170
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,070
get out of this one.
And he says,

1171
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:56,933
well,
I believe sometimes it's good to hit 

1172
00:54:00,121 --> 00:54:00,954
one.
They just push it and push it and they 

1173
00:54:03,751 --> 00:54:04,584
don't know when to let it go.
And then some time shafter use the back 

1174
00:54:08,071 --> 00:54:09,840
of your hand.
And he did.

1175
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:14,260
And you can see the har it Barbara 
Walters phase,

1176
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:20,520
last tango in Paris.
Brando was 48 and she was 19 wow.

1177
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:25,110
And so they did that to her without her 
having any idea that she was going to do

1178
00:54:25,111 --> 00:54:26,550
it.
That that was the scene.

1179
00:54:27,190 --> 00:54:28,023
Yeah.

1180
00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:32,790
Man,
they didn't have her consent.

1181
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:35,133
It wasn't,
or something like that that he didn't 

1182
00:54:36,811 --> 00:54:39,720
regret filming the scene without 
Schneider's consent,

1183
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:42,450
but admitted to feeling guilty.
Huh?

1184
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:45,220
Wow.
48 Brando.

1185
00:54:45,630 --> 00:54:48,790
She was 19 that's great.
Brenda was a free car.

1186
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:51,090
What a strange guy.
Company got giant.

1187
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:52,493
He just got enormous and apparently that
was why they filmed them in apocalypse 

1188
00:54:55,891 --> 00:54:57,750
now.
Like the oldest film them in the dark.

1189
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:00,040
So big.
Yeah,

1190
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:03,450
just crazy fucker.
You know,

1191
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:07,950
when you think about trying to figure 
out what life is about,

1192
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:10,680
like now as an adult,
we're,

1193
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:14,520
we're the poor fools that will be looked
upon by our grandchildren.

1194
00:55:14,521 --> 00:55:16,290
Like fools.
Like when,

1195
00:55:16,291 --> 00:55:19,440
when our grandchildren are our age and 
they talk about,

1196
00:55:19,470 --> 00:55:20,303
you know,
how fucking goofy our world was that we 

1197
00:55:23,851 --> 00:55:26,280
live in now.
No wonder why we elected trump.

1198
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:27,353
No wonder why we still have this 
ridiculous electoral college system and 

1199
00:55:31,081 --> 00:55:33,870
we still have representative democracy.

1200
00:55:33,870 --> 00:55:34,703
You still can't vote online.
The wonder why pot is still illegal in 

1201
00:55:37,801 --> 00:55:41,820
most of the country.
No wonder why private prisons are filled

1202
00:55:41,821 --> 00:55:46,050
with people in jail for ridiculous shit 
and people are profiting off it.

1203
00:55:46,070 --> 00:55:48,960
No wonder why they didn't get it yet.
They were so close.

1204
00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:50,063
We're just like,
we're looking back on like the people 

1205
00:55:51,451 --> 00:55:54,840
that own slaves and were going,
how did they do that?

1206
00:55:54,841 --> 00:55:55,674
How could that ever happen?
How could the United States have been 

1207
00:55:57,841 --> 00:55:58,674
founded by slave labor?
How could these people have brought 

1208
00:56:00,751 --> 00:56:01,584
these people from Africa?
How could they have beaten them and 

1209
00:56:03,331 --> 00:56:06,240
tortured them and cut their feet off if 
they didn't,

1210
00:56:06,270 --> 00:56:08,850
if they tried to flee,
but they did.

1211
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:10,573
And this is going to be the same thing 
people say of us when they look back on 

1212
00:56:13,321 --> 00:56:14,940
us,
they got to go,

1213
00:56:14,941 --> 00:56:15,774
oh my God,
they were,

1214
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:18,090
they didn't.
They had to kill animals to get meat.

1215
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:18,983
Dude,
they didn't even get meat from the meat 

1216
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,740
science.
There's no meat science.

1217
00:56:22,890 --> 00:56:24,340
They didn't have a meat science company.

1218
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:26,200
They just got,
they had a shoot.

1219
00:56:26,201 --> 00:56:28,000
Things with sticks.

1220
00:56:29,530 --> 00:56:31,730
They haven't figured out Asians were 
robots yet.

1221
00:56:32,870 --> 00:56:35,570
I think there are aliens that microphone
is on.

1222
00:56:35,690 --> 00:56:36,940
My girlfriend doesn't have a,
uh,

1223
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:38,173
you know,
where you pound on the knee and it 

1224
00:56:39,590 --> 00:56:40,423
reflects reflex like three people.
I've tried it on her knees when she's 

1225
00:56:43,101 --> 00:56:44,240
around you.
She's numb.

1226
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:51,200
But three people have tried.
But my thought was

1227
00:56:51,490 --> 00:56:55,460
there's like,
I feel like if you had to pick one,

1228
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:56,753
eh,
one ethnicity that excels in like 

1229
00:56:59,601 --> 00:57:02,720
science and mathematics,
I always go with Asian.

1230
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:03,733
I just always feel like they,
and that is that racist in a positive 

1231
00:57:06,081 --> 00:57:07,100
way.
Because if it is,

1232
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:10,040
I'm positively racist towards agents.
I just think they have,

1233
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:14,270
there's a great deal of them that are 
really good at science and mathematics

1234
00:57:14,590 --> 00:57:16,030
and if they're,
if they're aliens,

1235
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:18,640
they probably just crashed here cause 
they were driving their ufo.

1236
00:57:18,730 --> 00:57:19,563
My thought was that when the Annunaki 
came down here and they kidnapped the 

1237
00:57:25,091 --> 00:57:26,710
monkeys and they turned them into 
people,

1238
00:57:26,950 --> 00:57:30,670
they had probably like varying doses,
you know,

1239
00:57:30,671 --> 00:57:33,250
like my people didn't get,
like the Italians didn't get a very good

1240
00:57:33,251 --> 00:57:35,890
dose of alien.
It's like mostly monkey,

1241
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:38,620
some alien either just use one kind of 
monkey.

1242
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:40,810
It's multiple kinds of monkeys.
May Be.

1243
00:57:41,310 --> 00:57:45,040
It's possible to also,
where were all the hominids?

1244
00:57:45,070 --> 00:57:49,180
Were they all in one little forest,
the ones that became people or was it,

1245
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:52,360
was there similar things happening in 
several spots all throughout the world?

1246
00:57:52,361 --> 00:57:54,040
Like a lot of other animals,
like birds.

1247
00:57:54,250 --> 00:57:55,083
I think I'm on many different birds.
There are the different birds all over 

1248
00:57:57,911 --> 00:57:59,260
the fucking planet.
Right.

1249
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:02,560
Why would we,
why would we assume that the only places

1250
00:58:03,070 --> 00:58:03,903
that we didn't make any sense,
we actually kind of know where the 

1251
00:58:06,761 --> 00:58:07,594
monkeys were from.

1252
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:10,090
Yeah.
The uncontacted Amazon tribe.

1253
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:13,000
This is really recent.
They had these pictures of these people,

1254
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:17,050
these fucking people man are living 
right now.

1255
00:58:17,051 --> 00:58:17,884
Like it just,
there's something fucked up about going 

1256
00:58:20,771 --> 00:58:22,750
in there and taking pictures.
It's really,

1257
00:58:22,870 --> 00:58:25,060
I get that everybody wants to see it,
but it's,

1258
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:26,253
you're going to ruin this.
Like this is incredible and I know it's 

1259
00:58:30,881 --> 00:58:31,714
important.
It's a total catch 22 cause I know it's 

1260
00:58:33,701 --> 00:58:36,580
important to document.
It's very important document,

1261
00:58:36,850 --> 00:58:37,683
but it's also,
this is an amazing thing that exists 

1262
00:58:41,531 --> 00:58:43,900
right now.
You could peer into the past.

1263
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:45,033
These people are literally live in,
that guy has a homemade bow and arrow 

1264
00:58:48,130 --> 00:58:52,210
and you can see as cac,
he's got a little arrows strapped to his

1265
00:58:52,211 --> 00:58:53,044
hip.
He's got a leaf over his dick and that 

1266
00:58:55,061 --> 00:58:55,894
guy's pointing at bow and Arrow at this 
drone or whatever the hell it is is 

1267
00:58:58,781 --> 00:58:59,770
taking these photos.

1268
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:01,810
I don't know what they smell like,
dude,

1269
00:59:01,811 --> 00:59:03,910
they don't know what's going on and 
they're freaking out.

1270
00:59:03,911 --> 00:59:05,850
This is crazy.
Like look at that.

1271
00:59:05,870 --> 00:59:08,560
Look on that guy's face.
He doesn't even know what he's seeing.

1272
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:10,083
This an uncontacted tribe man,
like as they go deeper and deeper into 

1273
00:59:14,141 --> 00:59:17,680
the Amazon,
they find pockets of prehistoric people.

1274
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:19,173
They don't have any,
they don't have any contact with the 

1275
00:59:20,771 --> 00:59:22,850
outside world.
They're not wearing tee shirts.

1276
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:25,850
They're not wearing adidas.
They don't have any plastic.

1277
00:59:26,540 --> 00:59:31,190
These fucking people are living just 
like people lived 30,000

1278
00:59:31,191 --> 00:59:34,220
years ago there.
That's amazing.

1279
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:38,990
She knows man,
to be able to,

1280
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:39,973
this is such a rare moment.
If they could figure out a way to visit 

1281
00:59:43,461 --> 00:59:46,640
these people,
like have them except you.

1282
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:48,113
You would have to actually be one of 
them to really find out what their like 

1283
00:59:51,371 --> 00:59:55,310
like unaffected.
You would almost have to be one of them.

1284
00:59:55,490 --> 00:59:56,323
Well,
you'd have to do is you'd have to take 

1285
00:59:57,411 --> 00:59:59,450
one of them,
kidnap them,

1286
01:00:00,050 --> 01:00:02,870
copy their brain onto a robot that 
looked like them.

1287
01:00:03,170 --> 01:00:06,320
Send that robot in to talk to the 
picnics to the

1288
01:00:06,530 --> 01:00:09,020
what if he just came in there with like 
a bunch of dead meat though.

1289
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:10,280
Like here,
like just holding up,

1290
01:00:10,281 --> 01:00:11,470
meet,
walking slowly going,

1291
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:13,160
hey,
and you're putting it down.

1292
01:00:13,161 --> 01:00:14,760
Then they might give me,
he's giving us,

1293
01:00:14,990 --> 01:00:15,823
see the thing about these hunter 
gatherer tribes like this is they need 

1294
01:00:19,011 --> 01:00:21,470
to get food every day.
Like if you give the meat,

1295
01:00:21,471 --> 01:00:22,304
they'll be super happy.
But it's not like if I gave you a side 

1296
01:00:24,051 --> 01:00:25,250
of beef,
he'd be like,

1297
01:00:25,310 --> 01:00:27,530
wow,
I'll put this in the freezer like this.

1298
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:32,060
That meat is not going to last like no 
matter what,

1299
01:00:32,390 --> 01:00:35,000
it's just not going to,
they're in the jungle.

1300
01:00:35,030 --> 01:00:37,700
It gets funky in an hour.
Punch of twinkies.

1301
01:00:37,701 --> 01:00:42,500
Then they got a hunt everyday dude,
my friend Steve Rinella went to this uh,

1302
01:00:42,530 --> 01:00:44,090
place in,
um,

1303
01:00:44,210 --> 01:00:45,043
fuck was it bornea Bolivia.
He went to Bolivia and he hung out with 

1304
01:00:49,731 --> 01:00:50,210
these,
uh,

1305
01:00:50,210 --> 01:00:53,180
tribal people in Bolivia,
in the woods with them,

1306
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:55,370
said it was nuts.
They don't wear shoes there.

1307
01:00:55,490 --> 01:00:58,220
Their feet are like thick with calluses 
and they're,

1308
01:00:58,221 --> 01:01:00,160
they're splayed out,
their toes are splayed out.

1309
01:01:00,170 --> 01:01:02,000
It's like you're,
their feet don't look anything like ours

1310
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:03,530
because they never wear shoes.

1311
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:06,230
And they gave these guys some shoes 
like,

1312
01:01:06,231 --> 01:01:07,064
hey,
you know,

1313
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:08,450
as a gift.
And they put them on and you're like,

1314
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:09,313
what the fuck is this?
They didn't want them like their feet 

1315
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:14,900
have gotten so calloused dcs.
They don't have to use these.

1316
01:01:14,901 --> 01:01:17,000
Probably don't have anything.
Sorry,

1317
01:01:17,001 --> 01:01:20,270
Jamie didn't make any sense.
They gave in one of them.

1318
01:01:20,310 --> 01:01:23,090
Right,
but they gave these people boots,

1319
01:01:23,150 --> 01:01:23,983
Brian,
that you would wear if you lived in the 

1320
01:01:25,731 --> 01:01:26,564
jungle.
They didn't want to have nothing to do 

1321
01:01:27,081 --> 01:01:27,914
with it.
I guess if you just walk around all the 

1322
01:01:29,631 --> 01:01:30,464
time,
your feet would get so hard that you 

1323
01:01:33,141 --> 01:01:35,120
could walk on anything.
Yeah.

1324
01:01:35,510 --> 01:01:37,820
Have you seen that guy's feet that like 
walked across the country?

1325
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:41,260
Which country?
This country really barefoot.

1326
01:01:41,290 --> 01:01:44,180
Yeah.
America is doing it right now actually,

1327
01:01:44,181 --> 01:01:45,680
I think for the three barefoot.
Yeah.

1328
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:47,380
It sounds like a bad idea.
Well,

1329
01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:48,293
there was that one guy that was on that 
dual survival show and that was his 

1330
01:01:50,601 --> 01:01:52,910
shtick was that he walks barefoot 
everywhere.

1331
01:01:52,930 --> 01:01:53,691
You never knew him,
man.

1332
01:01:53,691 --> 01:01:55,820
When the shoe store is going to run off.
She was imagine though,

1333
01:01:55,821 --> 01:01:56,654
if you live your whole life like an 
asshole walking outside barefoot and 

1334
01:01:58,851 --> 01:02:00,880
then the day you die you're like,
God dammit.

1335
01:02:00,890 --> 01:02:03,680
They still have shoes and then two and 
then ends.

1336
01:02:03,790 --> 01:02:05,330
Are you mostly barefoot around your 
house?

1337
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:06,500
Yeah,
I'm barefoot all the time.

1338
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:08,360
What does that,
that's his feet.

1339
01:02:08,410 --> 01:02:10,190
Yeah,
my feet.

1340
01:02:10,610 --> 01:02:11,810
That doesn't look that bad.
Yeah,

1341
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:15,630
it looks like that's a woman dude.
Oh God.

1342
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:18,800
This is your personal collection.
Are you sure?

1343
01:02:18,850 --> 01:02:20,060
Yeah.
That's

1344
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:21,120
his name.
Yeah.

1345
01:02:21,121 --> 01:02:21,954
I said mark bombers.
Why does that look like a woman in that 

1346
01:02:23,161 --> 01:02:24,300
photo along here?
I don't know.

1347
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:26,070
Oh,
is that a hippie thing?

1348
01:02:26,130 --> 01:02:28,940
Yeah.
Did I just do,

1349
01:02:29,070 --> 01:02:32,850
I do what grandpa does.
46th day of walking barefoot.

1350
01:02:32,851 --> 01:02:34,680
It's my 46 days though.
Oh,

1351
01:02:34,681 --> 01:02:36,570
that's when they just started out doing 
it.

1352
01:02:36,670 --> 01:02:37,503
It's not,
he hasn't been doing it for years or 

1353
01:02:38,161 --> 01:02:41,070
anything.
I would imagine more cuts and stuff.

1354
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:42,750
It doesn't seem like a good idea.
Well,

1355
01:02:42,751 --> 01:02:43,584
it seems like you definitely would get 
some infections and shit in the 

1356
01:02:45,571 --> 01:02:49,050
beginning,
which seems like mental illness with the

1357
01:02:49,051 --> 01:02:49,884
guy has.
I think it's one of those things where 

1358
01:02:50,881 --> 01:02:53,010
you just gotta do it over and over and 
over again.

1359
01:02:53,330 --> 01:02:54,163
I'd do it slowly and then have it built 
up to go to see if you find that dual 

1360
01:02:57,571 --> 01:02:59,470
survivor his feet,
because he,

1361
01:02:59,471 --> 01:03:02,060
he used to walk on the show everywhere 
in the jungle,

1362
01:03:02,110 --> 01:03:03,930
stepping on twigs and shit barefoot.

1363
01:03:04,110 --> 01:03:06,030
His feet were way more discussing that 
guys,

1364
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:09,150
his feet will like Werewolf feet.
They just look cool.

1365
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:12,010
But if you want to,
you know,

1366
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:13,073
if you want to just have tough feet,
I think of that Jesus had a fucked up 

1367
01:03:16,801 --> 01:03:19,320
foot.
That's the dual survivor guy.

1368
01:03:19,740 --> 01:03:20,670
Yeah.
Yeah.

1369
01:03:20,671 --> 01:03:21,870
His ridiculous feat,
Dude.

1370
01:03:22,410 --> 01:03:23,850
Everywhere he goes,
he walks.

1371
01:03:23,851 --> 01:03:26,640
Look at that barefoot.
Disgusting.

1372
01:03:26,670 --> 01:03:29,430
Imagine paying someone to suck your toes
and they look like that.

1373
01:03:30,210 --> 01:03:31,530
You don't have to be a real piece of 
shit.

1374
01:03:32,430 --> 01:03:34,440
Wow.
You wouldn't even feel it.

1375
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:36,780
You might as well be sucking on the 
bottom of a table,

1376
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:38,940
you know?
You don't feel that like those,

1377
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,280
those things are numb.
I would imagine.

1378
01:03:41,670 --> 01:03:43,410
The only good thing about having cow's 
feet though.

1379
01:03:43,411 --> 01:03:46,290
It's like when you start stepping on 
things that would normally hurt you,

1380
01:03:46,291 --> 01:03:47,124
you won't feel it.
So it's kind of like making your own 

1381
01:03:48,181 --> 01:03:49,350
shoe out of,
you're on foot with,

1382
01:03:49,351 --> 01:03:50,184
but that's just the bottom of the hill 
that looks infected and that looks like 

1383
01:03:53,041 --> 01:03:55,170
the homeless guy by my house with 
gangrene.

1384
01:03:55,950 --> 01:03:58,110
What does named Cody London.
That's his name.

1385
01:03:58,260 --> 01:04:00,380
Shout out to cody.
It's not,

1386
01:04:00,390 --> 01:04:01,223
that's an interesting world man.
That world of people that are preppers 

1387
01:04:04,170 --> 01:04:06,600
and survivalists and they want to stay 
alive.

1388
01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:09,370
And I had another conversation with less
trout the other day.

1389
01:04:09,371 --> 01:04:12,220
He came to the comedy store.
He's doubling down on big foot.

1390
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:17,850
Let me see the socks.
I wish,

1391
01:04:17,910 --> 01:04:20,160
I wish he uh,
I wish you found them.

1392
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:24,750
I would fucking love it.
I'll be so happy if less trout found big

1393
01:04:24,751 --> 01:04:26,310
foot.
He's fuck.

1394
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:29,640
He goes looking for it all the time.
Seriously.

1395
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:32,460
What if there's like five of them?
There's only five of them.

1396
01:04:35,190 --> 01:04:38,580
Even talking about it as if there might 
be a possibility.

1397
01:04:38,610 --> 01:04:40,650
Journeys you're angry.
Meanwhile you,

1398
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:41,813
you have no problem with a lot of other 
ridiculous fantasies like movies and 

1399
01:04:46,111 --> 01:04:48,480
video games and all kinds of fancy 
stuff.

1400
01:04:48,481 --> 01:04:49,314
Right?
You have no problem with rogue one boot 

1401
01:04:51,990 --> 01:04:52,823
one haven't seen.
Have you seen it to know it hurts code 

1402
01:04:55,750 --> 01:04:56,583
here.
It's very good.

1403
01:04:56,970 --> 01:04:58,890
I liked the last one.
So young.

1404
01:04:58,891 --> 01:05:00,330
Jamie says as much better than the last 
one.

1405
01:05:00,580 --> 01:05:01,610
Oh yeah,
that's true.

1406
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:03,780
I mean,
I enjoyed it more cooler,

1407
01:05:04,350 --> 01:05:07,140
but I don't know what the fuck's going 
on though is that's part of the problem.

1408
01:05:07,170 --> 01:05:09,570
It's like when does it happening?
It's a prelude to which one?

1409
01:05:09,571 --> 01:05:11,220
The original what?
Hold on.

1410
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:13,470
So this is just before,
okay,

1411
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:16,740
so the last one was way after the first 
one,

1412
01:05:16,990 --> 01:05:20,080
but this new one is going to way be way 
before the first one.

1413
01:05:20,310 --> 01:05:22,000
The last,
the last one you saw?

1414
01:05:22,060 --> 01:05:22,893
Yes.
Yeah,

1415
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:23,793
I think so.
That's way after darth vader when get 

1416
01:05:24,951 --> 01:05:26,650
out last year.
This is the first one.

1417
01:05:26,651 --> 01:05:28,180
Spoiler alert.
I mean,

1418
01:05:28,181 --> 01:05:29,014
Han Solo was older,
obviously this is like after the first 

1419
01:05:31,091 --> 01:05:31,570
one,
right?

1420
01:05:31,570 --> 01:05:32,403
But now this one's going to go before 
the original one that introduced Han 

1421
01:05:35,530 --> 01:05:36,363
Solo.

1422
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:41,380
But you're never going to get a fucking 
Han solo guy again.

1423
01:05:42,060 --> 01:05:42,893
I feel like like that the age of that 
kind of actor is pretty much over the 

1424
01:05:48,551 --> 01:05:53,551
age of like the superstar movie,
like iconic Han Solo type characters.

1425
01:05:55,420 --> 01:05:58,390
I was thinking about that recently.
I think the problem is that it's because

1426
01:05:58,391 --> 01:06:01,090
those guys are still here doing those 
movies.

1427
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:02,710
Bruce Willis,
Tom Cruise,

1428
01:06:02,740 --> 01:06:05,830
Harrison Ford's still making movies,
but doe many outs.

1429
01:06:05,831 --> 01:06:06,664
I mean they did.
It doesn't seem like any new guys are 

1430
01:06:08,861 --> 01:06:12,040
doing that.
See the new blade runners is a new blade

1431
01:06:12,041 --> 01:06:13,270
runner.
Oh God.

1432
01:06:13,330 --> 01:06:15,480
And Harrison Ford's in it.
And uh,

1433
01:06:15,490 --> 01:06:18,310
what's his face?
Mark or Ryan Gosling.

1434
01:06:18,670 --> 01:06:19,690
Yeah.
Ryan gosling.

1435
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:21,460
Ooh.
But what about the other guy?

1436
01:06:21,690 --> 01:06:22,810
Um,
who was the,

1437
01:06:22,811 --> 01:06:27,070
the main robot guy?
Fuck robot guy.

1438
01:06:27,340 --> 01:06:28,570
Yeah.
The guy who was,

1439
01:06:28,571 --> 01:06:29,404
um,
his main enemy at the end of the first 

1440
01:06:31,871 --> 01:06:32,830
movie.
Oh,

1441
01:06:33,220 --> 01:06:33,490
rutger.

1442
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:34,240
Hauer.
Yeah.

1443
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,130
Remember that guy?
That guy was the shit.

1444
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:39,190
This is the preview watching him right 
now.

1445
01:06:39,191 --> 01:06:41,350
The new one.
Pull this audio.

1446
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:42,581
Okay.
Yeah.

1447
01:06:42,581 --> 01:06:47,581
Pull the audio narration going on right 
now with Harrison Ford.

1448
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:51,070
And uh,
I see.

1449
01:06:51,071 --> 01:06:52,510
It's weird.
When you redo something,

1450
01:06:52,511 --> 01:06:54,100
man,
you had redoing it.

1451
01:06:54,130 --> 01:06:54,963
It seems like they're doing it right 
cause they kept the narrative is a real 

1452
01:06:58,241 --> 01:07:02,890
feel of the film and there this looks 
dope and it's by really Scott again.

1453
01:07:02,891 --> 01:07:03,970
So,
oh,

1454
01:07:04,870 --> 01:07:05,561
powerful.
Really.

1455
01:07:05,561 --> 01:07:09,550
Scott Alien snakes walking up to some 
like ship.

1456
01:07:09,551 --> 01:07:13,120
It looks up.
Oh yeah.

1457
01:07:13,121 --> 01:07:18,121
Maybe this is not the best thing for 
people to have on Youtube.

1458
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:23,340
Okay.
All right.

1459
01:07:23,470 --> 01:07:25,060
Let's just,
we'll see it later.

1460
01:07:25,270 --> 01:07:26,500
I'll show up.
We'll see it later.

1461
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:28,750
Oh this isn't even the one I saw.
It was a different one.

1462
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:29,740
Yeah.
Oh my God.

1463
01:07:29,741 --> 01:07:31,210
Brian,
this is happening in real time.

1464
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:32,501
Oh wait,
no,

1465
01:07:32,501 --> 01:07:37,501
this is all right.
Yeah.

1466
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:40,300
And then which Ryan,
is that awesome?

1467
01:07:40,350 --> 01:07:41,280
Okay,
I'm confused.

1468
01:07:41,340 --> 01:07:42,173
I saw him the other day at,
this is the Reynolds and the gospel by 

1469
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:48,480
Harrison Ford with a gun.
It looks all shaky.

1470
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:53,840
I might rush them.
So great blade runner.

1471
01:07:54,060 --> 01:07:56,370
Wow,
that'd be bad ass.

1472
01:07:56,490 --> 01:07:57,670
I hope they do it well.
I just,

1473
01:07:57,750 --> 01:07:58,583
I think we need more science fiction 
movies that are really good and we need 

1474
01:08:01,381 --> 01:08:03,660
more horror movies that are really good.
Just not enough.

1475
01:08:04,270 --> 01:08:08,210
Not in a fucking monster movies anymore.
Just stop making them black mirrors that

1476
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:09,113
my latest new horror.
Maybe I should just fucking creepy as 

1477
01:08:11,371 --> 01:08:13,050
fuck.
That's a crazy,

1478
01:08:13,051 --> 01:08:15,500
crazy show.
One of my favorite shows of time.

1479
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:15,980
Why

1480
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:17,630
is it a monster movie?
Well,

1481
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:18,493
well,
one of the episodes each episode's 

1482
01:08:19,580 --> 01:08:22,420
really fucked up,
but one episodes scare like,

1483
01:08:22,490 --> 01:08:26,950
like he's in a haunted house and it's 
mixing virtual reality with simulation.

1484
01:08:27,110 --> 01:08:28,850
Oiler alert.
Spoiler alert.

1485
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:30,590
Floody farther.
It's crazy though.

1486
01:08:30,630 --> 01:08:32,340
Um,
we,

1487
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:33,390
I got so high.
Yes,

1488
01:08:33,391 --> 01:08:35,190
they would run away.
I started believing in ghosts.

1489
01:08:36,660 --> 01:08:38,970
Ron White was telling me he lived in a 
haunted house and I was like,

1490
01:08:38,971 --> 01:08:40,170
wow.
You sure?

1491
01:08:40,650 --> 01:08:42,180
Wow.
Used to live in a haunted house.

1492
01:08:42,181 --> 01:08:43,014
Your shorts haunted.
I was looking at those rules up on real 

1493
01:08:44,971 --> 01:08:46,080
estate.
There is something,

1494
01:08:46,081 --> 01:08:46,914
they've been in California,
you have to disclose if someone died in 

1495
01:08:49,171 --> 01:08:50,760
your house.
If you're trying to sell it within three

1496
01:08:50,761 --> 01:08:53,370
years or something like that,
she'd be a lot more than that.

1497
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:54,770
That's for a lot less than that.
Rather.

1498
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:56,580
That's for smell reasons though or 
something.

1499
01:08:56,620 --> 01:08:58,290
That's for health code reasons.
Her,

1500
01:08:58,320 --> 01:08:59,550
I dunno.
Not less than that.

1501
01:08:59,551 --> 01:09:00,960
I meant more than that in the first 
place.

1502
01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:02,430
Um,
that was,

1503
01:09:02,431 --> 01:09:04,260
uh,
I was going to bring up a story about,

1504
01:09:04,261 --> 01:09:05,780
um,
um,

1505
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:08,640
the girl who died in boulder.
What's the little girl's name?

1506
01:09:08,710 --> 01:09:11,130
That benet Ramsey.
Ramsey.

1507
01:09:11,131 --> 01:09:12,510
Yeah.
That house,

1508
01:09:12,540 --> 01:09:15,140
they can't sell the fucking house.
They can't sell.

1509
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:17,580
They've changed the name of the street.
They can't sell that house.

1510
01:09:17,610 --> 01:09:19,350
How much is it?
It changed your address.

1511
01:09:19,410 --> 01:09:22,050
You don't want to do this.
It's expensive house.

1512
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:24,540
Very nice house.
It's in boulder,

1513
01:09:24,541 --> 01:09:26,910
like in boulder proper,
which is like very expensive.

1514
01:09:27,210 --> 01:09:28,100
They sold it.
Yeah.

1515
01:09:28,230 --> 01:09:30,640
Houses.
When does this,

1516
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:32,280
this year.
Wow.

1517
01:09:33,030 --> 01:09:36,450
That house has been for sale for,
I'm not exaggerating.

1518
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:38,700
Maybe like nine years.
10 years.

1519
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:39,720
Damn.
Yeah,

1520
01:09:39,721 --> 01:09:40,554
and I think some people bought it and 
they redid it and they tried to change 

1521
01:09:43,411 --> 01:09:44,860
the name of it.
That's who this is.

1522
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:45,953
They own the house.
The people that bought it right after 

1523
01:09:47,071 --> 01:09:49,440
the randy's moved out in 2004,
I guess,

1524
01:09:49,441 --> 01:09:51,540
had been trying to sell it for 10 years.
Yeah.

1525
01:09:51,630 --> 01:09:54,510
So they just sold it and some new people
bought it.

1526
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:56,430
Man,
if it is haunted,

1527
01:09:56,550 --> 01:09:59,640
I don't think there's a um,
expiration date on ghost.

1528
01:09:59,641 --> 01:10:02,460
Dude Watch.
They were having trouble selling it.

1529
01:10:02,790 --> 01:10:04,070
Oh,
so they haven't sold it yet.

1530
01:10:04,140 --> 01:10:04,681
Yeah.
Okay.

1531
01:10:04,681 --> 01:10:05,514
So that's the case.
So that was the point is that these 

1532
01:10:06,781 --> 01:10:09,090
people bought this house,
they fixed it up and they're like,

1533
01:10:09,091 --> 01:10:10,080
well,
it's beautiful house.

1534
01:10:10,110 --> 01:10:12,180
It'll sell.
Nobody wants it.

1535
01:10:12,820 --> 01:10:15,250
I started watching it go show recently 
and that's like,

1536
01:10:15,370 --> 01:10:16,690
I think you've talked about it many 
times,

1537
01:10:16,691 --> 01:10:20,680
but I've never seen it before that ghost
hunters or what a,

1538
01:10:20,730 --> 01:10:24,280
what a ridiculous fake show that is.
There's a bunch of them.

1539
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:25,513
We know which one you saw,
but there's like four or five different 

1540
01:10:27,790 --> 01:10:28,900
of those.
Ghost shows.

1541
01:10:28,930 --> 01:10:29,763
The one that's and true tv w but they 
actually edit in like kids laughing and 

1542
01:10:33,971 --> 01:10:35,500
stuff and they're like,
do your that.

1543
01:10:35,860 --> 01:10:39,190
I swear it sounds like kids laughing and
it's just like a stock audio of like,

1544
01:10:40,030 --> 01:10:41,560
you know,
like it's so bad.

1545
01:10:41,810 --> 01:10:42,643
Yeah.
They don't have any obligation to tell 

1546
01:10:44,021 --> 01:10:46,900
the truth by the way.
Sorry if you're so fucking stupid.

1547
01:10:46,901 --> 01:10:47,734
You really believe that the guys on 
those ghost hunter shows are gonna 

1548
01:10:49,301 --> 01:10:52,450
expose the truth in the next commercial 
break.

1549
01:10:52,930 --> 01:10:54,870
You know,
like the next commercial break and wait,

1550
01:10:54,871 --> 01:10:56,590
what was that?
Oh my God.

1551
01:10:56,591 --> 01:10:58,150
Coming up next.
Oh,

1552
01:10:58,480 --> 01:10:59,470
he's not real

1553
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:02,633
show that people,
I think it was called fear on MTV with 

1554
01:11:04,781 --> 01:11:06,360
it.
I got a go pro on someone's face,

1555
01:11:06,390 --> 01:11:10,350
like go sit in this dark room for two 
hours and if you can think he went money

1556
01:11:10,351 --> 01:11:12,810
or some shit like theirs to try to 
freak.

1557
01:11:12,811 --> 01:11:13,980
I,
they were trying to freak them out,

1558
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:14,813
but they tried to make it seem like we 
are in haunted houses and different 

1559
01:11:17,311 --> 01:11:18,360
prisons and shit like that.

1560
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:20,480
Hmm.
That's awful.

1561
01:11:21,980 --> 01:11:23,860
Yeah.
Boy,

1562
01:11:23,861 --> 01:11:27,260
we love watching other people freak out.
It's like horror movies,

1563
01:11:27,261 --> 01:11:28,820
man.
Like there's,

1564
01:11:29,510 --> 01:11:30,343
what is it about a horror movie?
I remember that scene from American 

1565
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:33,793
Werewolf in London where there was a 
businessman on the subway in London and 

1566
01:11:37,761 --> 01:11:38,594
he's walking along and he looks behind 
him and he sees the wolf and you know 

1567
01:11:43,281 --> 01:11:45,860
that he sees the wolf and he starts 
running and you,

1568
01:11:45,950 --> 01:11:49,070
you barely see the wolf,
you see the wolf for like maybe a half,

1569
01:11:49,071 --> 01:11:49,904
a second like maybe and then he's 
running and he keeps looking back and 

1570
01:11:53,871 --> 01:11:54,704
he's terrified and he fucking runs up 
this escalator and he trips and falls 

1571
01:11:59,181 --> 01:12:00,014
and his briefcase falls apart and he's 
trying to pick up the stop and he looks 

1572
01:12:02,121 --> 01:12:02,954
down at the bottom of the escalator and 
for like a split second you see the 

1573
01:12:05,691 --> 01:12:10,610
Werewolf and it makes you shit your 
fucking pants.

1574
01:12:10,790 --> 01:12:11,623
Cause you think about like one of you 
were that guy and this thing is running 

1575
01:12:15,381 --> 01:12:19,300
through the airport chasing you and then
you just can't keep it together anymore.

1576
01:12:19,310 --> 01:12:21,470
You're out of shape.
You get to the top of that escalator,

1577
01:12:21,710 --> 01:12:23,000
you fall down,
you collapse.

1578
01:12:23,010 --> 01:12:24,650
He looked down and you're like,
oh my God,

1579
01:12:24,651 --> 01:12:25,221
it's,
they're like,

1580
01:12:25,221 --> 01:12:29,630
we love that shit.
People love being freaked out.

1581
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:33,050
Watch it.
Some poor bastard about to get jacked.

1582
01:12:33,540 --> 01:12:37,200
It stresses me out.
You don't like those movies?

1583
01:12:37,230 --> 01:12:38,400
I mean,
no,

1584
01:12:38,430 --> 01:12:40,110
I don't like being stressed out.
That's why I couldn't,

1585
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:43,230
I never finished breaking bad.
I've watched the first episode and I was

1586
01:12:43,231 --> 01:12:44,130
like,
yeah,

1587
01:12:44,131 --> 01:12:44,964
I get it.
That's,

1588
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,250
that was stressful.
I don't need to do any more.

1589
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:49,560
That gave up on the walking dead.
Really?

1590
01:12:49,561 --> 01:12:53,460
I heard it's just turned a corner now.
It was way too torturey.

1591
01:12:53,490 --> 01:12:55,020
I was like,
this is a torture show.

1592
01:12:55,620 --> 01:12:58,140
It's like all of a sudden the,
the zombies are pussies.

1593
01:12:58,770 --> 01:13:00,930
Like all of a sudden the zombies aren't 
any threat at all.

1594
01:13:00,931 --> 01:13:02,930
It's just the people.
She finished the zombies coming here.

1595
01:13:02,970 --> 01:13:04,980
You just fucking pushed him to the side.
Get out of here.

1596
01:13:05,190 --> 01:13:07,170
These zombies used to be able to tear 
open a horse.

1597
01:13:07,590 --> 01:13:08,423
They used to take down a fucking full 
grown horse or rip it apart and eat it 

1598
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:11,873
alive.

1599
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:17,180
Do you know how quick a fucking horse 
would run over 30 40 people,

1600
01:13:17,910 --> 01:13:20,940
like a 30 40 people.
Just regular strength.

1601
01:13:20,941 --> 01:13:21,774
People went and had a horse cornered in 
a stable and tried to eat the horse 

1602
01:13:26,791 --> 01:13:27,624
while it's alive.
That horse would kick the fuck out of 

1603
01:13:29,551 --> 01:13:31,470
you.
Everybody would go flying.

1604
01:13:31,471 --> 01:13:34,410
You would take maybe 15 seconds and we'd
all be dead.

1605
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:36,580
The horse would just kick you and kick 
you.

1606
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:39,480
You would never bite through his fucking
skin and eat him.

1607
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:42,780
But in this stupid show,
at one point in time,

1608
01:13:42,990 --> 01:13:44,880
the zombies could just tear open a 
horse.

1609
01:13:45,390 --> 01:13:46,223
So what are they?
Are they super powerful or are they 

1610
01:13:47,731 --> 01:13:50,700
pussies?
They walk like two miles an hour or that

1611
01:13:50,701 --> 01:13:54,090
could they corner a fucking giant horse?
Tell me what's going on here.

1612
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:57,210
What if one?
What if it's just like if the person was

1613
01:13:57,211 --> 01:13:59,700
super strong before they came,
became a Zombie.

1614
01:13:59,790 --> 01:14:03,660
It doesn't work on the horse.
Even a bunch of strong men get 50 strong

1615
01:14:03,661 --> 01:14:05,910
men to try to take out a horse.
That guy's going to get kicked.

1616
01:14:05,911 --> 01:14:07,590
This is not,
I don't want to see this,

1617
01:14:07,591 --> 01:14:08,970
Jamie.
Don't let me see this.

1618
01:14:09,870 --> 01:14:12,580
Oh son,
you got to Kod.

1619
01:14:13,260 --> 01:14:14,770
I got,
I got k the fuck.

1620
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:16,840
Oh God.
You got a whole sequence of them,

1621
01:14:16,870 --> 01:14:19,340
like a collaboration.
I do not want to watch a play in the PAC

1622
01:14:19,450 --> 01:14:21,910
dudes getting checked by horses.
But let me tell you something.

1623
01:14:22,210 --> 01:14:25,780
You could have a hundred people tried to
corral horse and rip it apart.

1624
01:14:25,781 --> 01:14:28,600
That horse will send people fucking 
flying.

1625
01:14:29,260 --> 01:14:30,430
It's like,
look,

1626
01:14:30,940 --> 01:14:33,820
if I was in a room with a hundred 
Chihuahuas,

1627
01:14:33,821 --> 01:14:36,940
it we're trying to kill me.
Guess who's getting out of the room?

1628
01:14:37,420 --> 01:14:38,253
Me,
you're going to be a hundred dead 

1629
01:14:39,581 --> 01:14:41,770
fucking two hours and me.
You know why?

1630
01:14:41,771 --> 01:14:44,950
Cause I'm a person and I'm bigger than a
goddamned Chihuahua.

1631
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:45,933
That's like a better I have.
I have less good odds than a hundred 

1632
01:14:49,631 --> 01:14:51,780
people trying to eat a horse.
Oh,

1633
01:14:51,781 --> 01:14:52,614
horses will kick the fuck out of you 
unless you have a gun or a spear or 

1634
01:14:55,721 --> 01:14:56,554
something.
You're going to have to penetrate that 

1635
01:14:57,671 --> 01:14:58,750
things.
Vital organs.

1636
01:14:58,751 --> 01:15:00,700
He's going to beat the fuck out of 
everybody.

1637
01:15:01,030 --> 01:15:02,170
You can't just eat the horse.

1638
01:15:02,620 --> 01:15:03,650
Yeah,

1639
01:15:05,180 --> 01:15:07,580
fuck Outta here.
Your rules don't fit.

1640
01:15:07,610 --> 01:15:08,740
They did that.
You're like,

1641
01:15:09,330 --> 01:15:10,163
you're,
you haven't made a coherent universe 

1642
01:15:13,010 --> 01:15:13,843
where things are consistent.
Like sometimes these zombies can tear 

1643
01:15:16,491 --> 01:15:20,480
through things and eat a living horse 
and sometimes he's fucking things.

1644
01:15:20,481 --> 01:15:22,730
You just push him to the side.
They can't even bite you.

1645
01:15:22,940 --> 01:15:25,250
Like they're not as frantic.
They move slower.

1646
01:15:25,460 --> 01:15:28,370
They're not a consideration.
This word we're doing,

1647
01:15:28,371 --> 01:15:32,270
we're breaking down the zombies and 
Zombie psychology here,

1648
01:15:32,380 --> 01:15:33,171
uh,
at all.

1649
01:15:33,171 --> 01:15:34,004
Things considered.
Please consider donating because what 

1650
01:15:37,250 --> 01:15:38,083
would we have put together here?
It's all put together by your generous 

1651
01:15:42,861 --> 01:15:47,360
contributions coming up next.
Zombie physics,

1652
01:15:48,850 --> 01:15:51,110
bite physics,
how they bite through things.

1653
01:15:51,290 --> 01:15:52,123
How do you buy?
All you need is like a thick jacket and 

1654
01:15:53,301 --> 01:15:54,970
just stab them on the head here.
Pipe my arm.

1655
01:15:54,971 --> 01:15:57,890
Stupid.
Stabbing the fucking head there.

1656
01:15:57,891 --> 01:15:59,000
It's super power.
Strength.

1657
01:15:59,090 --> 01:16:00,140
Yeah.
Sometimes.

1658
01:16:00,770 --> 01:16:03,050
Sometimes like the first episode of the 
new season,

1659
01:16:03,051 --> 01:16:07,170
Rick's just shucking them to the side.
Like he's some goddamn super linemen.

1660
01:16:07,190 --> 01:16:09,380
They're a bunch of high school players.
He's just chucking them,

1661
01:16:09,410 --> 01:16:12,110
moving them around like they're nothing.
Nobody bites him.

1662
01:16:12,111 --> 01:16:15,260
30 40 of them at a time.
Not one of them gets a hold of them,

1663
01:16:15,290 --> 01:16:16,820
bites him.
Fuck you.

1664
01:16:16,890 --> 01:16:20,070
It should be somebody's job to be like,
make sure that is a thing.

1665
01:16:20,071 --> 01:16:21,260
You know where the wood,
yeah.

1666
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:22,193
Consistent.
They can't do that with a storyline 

1667
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:25,420
because the storyline is too weird,
man.

1668
01:16:25,450 --> 01:16:27,690
The storyline is like now you know

1669
01:16:27,810 --> 01:16:28,643
everybody,
the zombies are still around but the 

1670
01:16:29,761 --> 01:16:30,594
people become a problem.
The zombies are still around but they 

1671
01:16:32,971 --> 01:16:36,630
don't eat and it's been years and uh,
I guess they're just around.

1672
01:16:36,750 --> 01:16:39,060
And a unlike anything we've ever 
observed,

1673
01:16:39,061 --> 01:16:41,610
they don't deteriorate and fall away 
from not eating.

1674
01:16:41,850 --> 01:16:42,683
Like what the fuck are these stupid slow
comments going to feed themselves every 

1675
01:16:45,661 --> 01:16:47,280
day?
Did they have a digestive system?

1676
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:48,850
They can just write into this story 
like,

1677
01:16:48,851 --> 01:16:49,720
oh,
we figured it out.

1678
01:16:49,721 --> 01:16:52,030
Why some are stronger than the others.
So some have eaten,

1679
01:16:52,031 --> 01:16:52,864
they hate

1680
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:56,050
that.
Sounds like an ABC after school.

1681
01:16:56,051 --> 01:16:57,340
Special finish.
Westworld.

1682
01:16:57,850 --> 01:16:59,380
Yes.
That's a good show.

1683
01:16:59,620 --> 01:17:01,300
I fucking love that.
That's great show.

1684
01:17:01,690 --> 01:17:02,523
That's a show that has so much weird 
room to move around cause they jumped 

1685
01:17:05,700 --> 01:17:06,533
timelines and you,
you never know who's a robot and who's 

1686
01:17:09,741 --> 01:17:10,010
not

1687
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:13,880
a robot and it's just getting slippery 
or and slippery or,

1688
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:18,050
and it's Anthony fucking hopkins and,
and the other guy,

1689
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:18,960
ed,
uh,

1690
01:17:20,180 --> 01:17:21,013
Harris and Harris both,
I mean top flight actors and then that 

1691
01:17:24,711 --> 01:17:27,770
girl who plays Delores,
what is her name?

1692
01:17:28,220 --> 01:17:29,510
God Damn,
she's good.

1693
01:17:30,050 --> 01:17:32,750
She scares the shit out of me.
Like a girl,

1694
01:17:32,751 --> 01:17:33,584
like that is the type of girl that could
just act like that and like get you to 

1695
01:17:40,131 --> 01:17:40,964
fall in love with her.
Like if a girl can act that good and a 

1696
01:17:43,071 --> 01:17:45,200
movie,
like if she wanted to use it for evil,

1697
01:17:45,980 --> 01:17:47,360
she could.
I feel like if data,

1698
01:17:47,361 --> 01:17:50,150
if you have these local girls,
these actresses,

1699
01:17:50,340 --> 01:17:52,100
Rachel Wood,
it's not fair.

1700
01:17:53,050 --> 01:17:54,560
If you can do that,
they can use it for evil.

1701
01:17:54,620 --> 01:17:55,453
Yeah,
they can date you pretty like hide the 

1702
01:17:56,781 --> 01:18:00,170
crazy way easier because they can just 
act like they're nice and normal.

1703
01:18:00,290 --> 01:18:03,140
Well also most people who are crazy 
don't even know that they're crazy.

1704
01:18:03,141 --> 01:18:04,790
It's not like you're going,
I know I'm crazy,

1705
01:18:04,791 --> 01:18:05,624
but I can't let Brian know I'm crazy.
So what I'm gonna do is I'm going to 

1706
01:18:07,821 --> 01:18:11,900
pretend even with facebook though,
and everyone calling them crazy for like

1707
01:18:11,900 --> 01:18:13,070
a couple of years,
and then they got to figure it out.

1708
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:14,360
Ego.
First of all,

1709
01:18:14,361 --> 01:18:16,970
those people on facebook,
I ain't paying him no mind cause I ain't

1710
01:18:16,971 --> 01:18:20,300
about haters.
I ain't about haters.

1711
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:21,193
Preach seat.
I think there's a way that we can all 

1712
01:18:23,271 --> 01:18:26,930
justify who we are and how we are.
And I don't think crazy people have some

1713
01:18:26,931 --> 01:18:29,600
sort of clarity that we don't possess.
I think that's ridiculous.

1714
01:18:29,601 --> 01:18:31,370
I think it's probably quite the 
opposite.

1715
01:18:31,820 --> 01:18:34,130
I bet they have way less clarity.
They have no idea.

1716
01:18:34,131 --> 01:18:35,750
They're crazy.
They think the world sucks.

1717
01:18:36,860 --> 01:18:37,693
World's full of retards.
Justin bieber went to bed and probably 

1718
01:18:40,281 --> 01:18:41,330
got up that morning,
man,

1719
01:18:41,331 --> 01:18:43,070
what a bunch of retards we met last 
night.

1720
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:45,640
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

1721
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:48,760
I mean,
the fucking redband retard oh garden,

1722
01:18:48,990 --> 01:18:51,620
you know,
like he probably has no idea how he came

1723
01:18:51,621 --> 01:18:52,454
off.
It's,

1724
01:18:52,700 --> 01:18:53,620
that's uh,
that's,

1725
01:18:53,870 --> 01:18:57,020
that's way more common than not.
So these real dummies,

1726
01:18:57,440 --> 01:19:00,080
it's crazy people,
these nutty people,

1727
01:19:00,081 --> 01:19:00,914
they probably didn't even know that that
nunny they think they're a little nutty 

1728
01:19:02,361 --> 01:19:03,920
sometimes.
What's the big deal?

1729
01:19:03,950 --> 01:19:05,720
God,
you know?

1730
01:19:06,940 --> 01:19:09,860
Yeah,
I have video of him saying,

1731
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:11,720
uh,
uh yeah,

1732
01:19:11,721 --> 01:19:15,890
but have you ever slept with 20 
supermodels to this black guy?

1733
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:17,660
And when the black guy came up,
he goes,

1734
01:19:17,661 --> 01:19:19,730
what's up man?
And word like he said,

1735
01:19:20,210 --> 01:19:21,890
no,
no to this black guy.

1736
01:19:21,940 --> 01:19:24,430
He like,
he yelled something to this black guy,

1737
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:27,920
said this black guy comes up and puts 
down his food and he goes,

1738
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:29,390
what's up?
Mind inward.

1739
01:19:29,910 --> 01:19:31,430
And I was like,
I'm scared of saying that word.

1740
01:19:31,430 --> 01:19:33,620
It's weird.
I don't like saying it man.

1741
01:19:33,890 --> 01:19:36,830
Because then nowadays people make it 
bring tones and shit.

1742
01:19:37,430 --> 01:19:42,430
Well it's a fucking problem.
Magic words are never good folks.

1743
01:19:43,130 --> 01:19:46,400
It's not good.
It's not good because it makes them more

1744
01:19:46,401 --> 01:19:47,234
valuable when you say it now it has,
it holds more power becomes a more 

1745
01:19:51,111 --> 01:19:55,970
loaded word that lenny bruce argued 
about that and like 1950s he,

1746
01:19:55,971 --> 01:19:56,804
it was one of his bits.
It was like one of his most 

1747
01:19:57,981 --> 01:19:58,814
controversial bits.
You would point people out in the 

1748
01:20:00,561 --> 01:20:03,620
audience and call there's a nigger,
there's a SPEC share the kike.

1749
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:05,180
Yeah,
yeah dude.

1750
01:20:05,210 --> 01:20:07,200
It was a crazy,
crazy bit.

1751
01:20:07,620 --> 01:20:07,980
And at the

1752
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:08,813
time like people had no idea where he 
was going with it because nobody had 

1753
01:20:12,661 --> 01:20:13,494
ever done that kind of comedy before.
But he was essentially saying that if 

1754
01:20:17,241 --> 01:20:18,930
you,
the more you use those words,

1755
01:20:18,931 --> 01:20:19,764
the more they lose their power and the 
more they'll never have the ability to 

1756
01:20:24,001 --> 01:20:27,090
hurt some child's feelings.
And it was pretty profound,

1757
01:20:27,330 --> 01:20:29,910
especially considering that he had,
you know,

1758
01:20:29,911 --> 01:20:33,850
had to realize like what happens when 
he's censor things and censor people and

1759
01:20:33,851 --> 01:20:36,180
ain't figured that out in the 1960 
somehow,

1760
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:39,060
you know,
he figured out like this is,

1761
01:20:39,750 --> 01:20:42,180
this is cakes counterproductive.
Like you can't,

1762
01:20:42,210 --> 01:20:46,380
you can't demonize a word where it's 
just conveying tent like we were talking

1763
01:20:46,381 --> 01:20:47,214
about earlier.
Like the hardest thing in the world is 

1764
01:20:49,501 --> 01:20:50,334
to convey your thoughts through your 
words and to make certain words 

1765
01:20:54,061 --> 01:20:54,894
supercharged and decide.
Certain words have like magic fucking 

1766
01:20:57,691 --> 01:20:59,970
powers in the game and they can jump 
three steps.

1767
01:21:00,330 --> 01:21:01,170
No,
no,

1768
01:21:01,230 --> 01:21:02,830
no,
they're just fucking words matter.

1769
01:21:03,170 --> 01:21:04,003
And words are supposed to be flexible 
and they're supposed to all contribute 

1770
01:21:08,610 --> 01:21:12,480
to the best possible job you can do of 
conveying your intent.

1771
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:13,913
And as soon as you have like 
supercharged war z you can't use 

1772
01:21:15,781 --> 01:21:17,580
anymore.
Well then I can't,

1773
01:21:17,610 --> 01:21:20,040
it's,
I have less tools to convey my intent.

1774
01:21:20,130 --> 01:21:20,963
I have less.
You have less of an ability to 

1775
01:21:22,921 --> 01:21:25,310
understand what I'm saying.
And you're,

1776
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:26,193
you're assuming that the exact same word
from one sentence to the next as the 

1777
01:21:31,621 --> 01:21:35,370
same con is the same content as the same
ability?

1778
01:21:35,610 --> 01:21:37,560
The same.
It means the same thing cause it doesn't

1779
01:21:37,561 --> 01:21:38,394
always mean the same thing.
You know like someone can call you a 

1780
01:21:40,591 --> 01:21:43,980
bitch and if it's your friend,
it's funny like if you,

1781
01:21:43,981 --> 01:21:44,814
if Dunkin comes over and like what's up 
bitch and and like goes to grab your 

1782
01:21:48,181 --> 01:21:48,720
take or something.

1783
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:49,900
Like it'd be hilarious,
right?

1784
01:21:50,250 --> 01:21:52,320
Cause he's Dunkin cause it's your 
friend.

1785
01:21:52,530 --> 01:21:55,950
Whereas if Justin Bieber says it to you 
in your,

1786
01:21:55,980 --> 01:21:57,180
you know,
in line,

1787
01:21:57,181 --> 01:21:58,950
in front of,
I'm a big boy,

1788
01:22:01,050 --> 01:22:01,920
you wouldn't,
you know,

1789
01:22:01,980 --> 01:22:04,290
this doesn't feel good.
Or if some guy says that to you,

1790
01:22:04,350 --> 01:22:06,030
some guy comes up to you like,
what's up bitch?

1791
01:22:06,150 --> 01:22:06,631
And you're like,
oh,

1792
01:22:06,631 --> 01:22:09,510
well this doesn't feel good.
It just feels terrible.

1793
01:22:09,540 --> 01:22:11,280
Right?
It's cause the intense different,

1794
01:22:11,380 --> 01:22:12,420
it's,
you know,

1795
01:22:12,421 --> 01:22:13,254
it's different.
The word doesn't always mean the same 

1796
01:22:15,151 --> 01:22:15,984
thing.
A word just conveys intent and it's not 

1797
01:22:19,141 --> 01:22:22,770
that fucking good me and we're really 
good at it compared to animals,

1798
01:22:22,830 --> 01:22:26,310
but we're not that good at it then then 
that an in that,

1799
01:22:26,311 --> 01:22:28,440
not that good at it.
That's why songs are cool.

1800
01:22:28,980 --> 01:22:31,110
You know,
like you could repeat the same shit over

1801
01:22:31,111 --> 01:22:32,910
and over and over again anywhere else.
That's annoying,

1802
01:22:33,420 --> 01:22:34,050
you know?

1803
01:22:34,050 --> 01:22:36,620
Ah,
well I don't fuck Whoa,

1804
01:22:36,770 --> 01:22:40,510
ah,
and potty you ever Bj,

1805
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:41,393
you got a whole crowd repeating the same
shit over and over and over again 

1806
01:22:45,240 --> 01:22:48,570
because we've decided that the,
those noises,

1807
01:22:48,571 --> 01:22:49,404
those words,
they convey an intent that we can all 

1808
01:22:51,511 --> 01:22:56,511
support and the music backs it up.
Right.

1809
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:03,120
You're not a big kiss fan.
You don't know.

1810
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:06,040
I don't understand.
Yeah.

1811
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:06,903
So what I'm saying,
you were denied that your youth should 

1812
01:23:09,151 --> 01:23:11,380
play kiss miniature golf in Vegas next 
time you go.

1813
01:23:11,420 --> 01:23:12,820
That's pretty fun.
How about no,

1814
01:23:13,330 --> 01:23:16,570
what,
what's to Hannah Walls that sing?

1815
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:18,700
Uh,
birds,

1816
01:23:18,701 --> 01:23:19,534
monkeys,
monkeys saying they make crazy sounds 

1817
01:23:22,070 --> 01:23:24,160
right,
but is that a call or a song?

1818
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:25,031
Um,
well,

1819
01:23:25,031 --> 01:23:27,280
none of them are songs.
I think birds are songs.

1820
01:23:27,370 --> 01:23:31,700
Maybe they're beautiful.
But what about like whales?

1821
01:23:32,030 --> 01:23:34,060
We all sing.
That's a humming,

1822
01:23:36,510 --> 01:23:37,520
like what is the,
okay,

1823
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:41,560
like do you think you know for sure what
a whale sounds like when it's like whale

1824
01:23:41,561 --> 01:23:43,400
sounds?
Do you know just the,

1825
01:23:43,450 --> 01:23:45,680
the audio that didn't hear the audio of 
weight?

1826
01:23:45,700 --> 01:23:48,070
Let's heal whale songs.
Yeah.

1827
01:23:48,071 --> 01:23:52,390
It's like that.
Riley a dolphins.

1828
01:23:52,391 --> 01:23:55,870
It's like,
alright,

1829
01:23:56,140 --> 01:23:57,810
so we know that [inaudible] humpback 
whales.

1830
01:23:57,850 --> 01:23:58,683
Okay,
here we go.

1831
01:23:59,590 --> 01:24:00,423
Whoa.
Oh,

1832
01:24:01,510 --> 01:24:03,430
speaking of which,
have you done the htc vive yet?

1833
01:24:03,790 --> 01:24:05,540
The Osha.
Oh No,

1834
01:24:05,541 --> 01:24:06,900
I signed up playstation.
Ocean.

1835
01:24:18,300 --> 01:24:19,133
Hello.

1836
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:48,793
Okay.

1837
01:24:50,040 --> 01:24:50,873
Wow.

1838
01:24:52,460 --> 01:24:54,050
It's just repeating it over and that's 
it.

1839
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:58,400
That's amazing.
That sounds incredible.

1840
01:24:58,940 --> 01:25:00,380
Wow.
I ducked just dat.

1841
01:25:00,381 --> 01:25:01,214
Sound alone.
Just completely changed the way I think 

1842
01:25:02,931 --> 01:25:03,764
about Wales.
Does that sound like crying to you or 

1843
01:25:05,810 --> 01:25:07,310
no?
Positive or negative?

1844
01:25:07,460 --> 01:25:08,293
They're communicating didn't sound 
negative sounding like they're 

1845
01:25:10,731 --> 01:25:11,564
communicating,
but it makes you realize how fucking 

1846
01:25:13,371 --> 01:25:15,680
smart they are.
I don't know what they're saying,

1847
01:25:15,681 --> 01:25:19,220
but I can tell that that's a language.
There were,

1848
01:25:19,290 --> 01:25:22,870
there were repeating certain sounds and 
doing it in a way that's,

1849
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:26,130
it's like it's clear the differences in 
the sounds.

1850
01:25:26,131 --> 01:25:28,420
It sounds like a fucking language man.
Yes.

1851
01:25:29,370 --> 01:25:31,050
And also you got to think like what up

1852
01:25:32,810 --> 01:25:33,643
when you,
when you stop and think about how we've 

1853
01:25:34,491 --> 01:25:35,324
all chosen certain languages,
whether it's Chinese or Spanish or 

1854
01:25:38,151 --> 01:25:38,850
whatever,
you know,

1855
01:25:38,850 --> 01:25:40,910
the region that we are,
the world that we live in,

1856
01:25:41,090 --> 01:25:41,923
we've chosen certain languages that 
become like our standard way of making 

1857
01:25:44,631 --> 01:25:48,110
sounds that convey our ideas.
But these things have,

1858
01:25:48,170 --> 01:25:52,160
they've gone a totally different path,
but it's Kinda the same thing.

1859
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:55,250
They're like those Amazon tribes,
people that they discovered,

1860
01:25:55,610 --> 01:25:56,780
you know,
their people,

1861
01:25:56,810 --> 01:26:00,050
their brains are probably just like our 
brains exactly the same,

1862
01:26:00,051 --> 01:26:02,990
but they never encountered all these 
metals,

1863
01:26:03,110 --> 01:26:04,010
plastics and

1864
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:08,010
all the innovations that came with the,
um,

1865
01:26:08,210 --> 01:26:09,043
industrial era.
So they just live like people have 

1866
01:26:10,761 --> 01:26:13,280
thousands and thousands of years ago,
but there's the same.

1867
01:26:13,310 --> 01:26:14,510
It's the same thing,
right?

1868
01:26:14,511 --> 01:26:15,344
They're just people.
They probably have some crazy language 

1869
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:19,510
that we don't know,
but go down there and try to figure it.

1870
01:26:19,511 --> 01:26:22,100
You'll hear them talking and be like,
what in the fuck are they saying?

1871
01:26:22,370 --> 01:26:24,620
Like what is this?
Like what kind of language is this?

1872
01:26:25,100 --> 01:26:26,750
That's what it was going on with that 
Dolphin.

1873
01:26:26,751 --> 01:26:29,210
I was listening to that think talk and I
was like,

1874
01:26:29,240 --> 01:26:31,460
oh my God,
they can't kill these.

1875
01:26:31,850 --> 01:26:34,700
How are they killing these?
They've got to stop killing me.

1876
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:38,600
Like whoever it is with this,
I know a sea shepherd bus,

1877
01:26:38,601 --> 01:26:40,760
a lot of people all the time sea 
shepherd,

1878
01:26:40,850 --> 01:26:44,630
they catch these people cause there's,
there's an embargo or not an embargo.

1879
01:26:44,631 --> 01:26:45,870
It's,
it's,

1880
01:26:45,910 --> 01:26:49,130
it's illegal in most places to kill 
whales.

1881
01:26:49,370 --> 01:26:50,203
But what what they do is they say they 
have a research vessel and they kill 

1882
01:26:52,941 --> 01:26:55,460
them for research,
but they're not research vessels.

1883
01:26:55,461 --> 01:26:57,170
They take them to chop them up and they 
sell them.

1884
01:26:57,740 --> 01:26:59,680
But they're still doing it like it's a,
it's,

1885
01:26:59,681 --> 01:27:02,690
it's a big deal in Japan apparently to 
dolphin.

1886
01:27:02,820 --> 01:27:05,720
Yeah.
Well dolphins is different animal,

1887
01:27:05,721 --> 01:27:08,330
but this is Wales.
There's still go wailing.

1888
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:09,313
They still kill whales and pull these 
giant ass fucking whales on these boats 

1889
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:13,033
and there's photo like seat,
see if you could pull up the sea 

1890
01:27:14,301 --> 01:27:16,400
shepherd photos,
sea shepherd photos,

1891
01:27:16,700 --> 01:27:19,370
see sea shepherd captures uh,
or uh,

1892
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:21,860
catches,
um,

1893
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:23,233
ship with whales on or something.
It was just really disturbing because 

1894
01:27:25,761 --> 01:27:26,594
like they have,
they figured out some loophole or the 

1895
01:27:28,661 --> 01:27:29,494
law,
you're allowed to kill them if you're a 

1896
01:27:30,351 --> 01:27:32,210
research vessel.
So like,

1897
01:27:32,211 --> 01:27:33,044
you know,
all you have to do is just pretend 

1898
01:27:35,901 --> 01:27:39,530
you're a research vessel or perform a 
couple of tests,

1899
01:27:39,531 --> 01:27:41,660
whatever is compulsory whenever you have
to do.

1900
01:27:42,290 --> 01:27:44,240
And then a cell,
all the whale parts,

1901
01:27:44,440 --> 01:27:46,730
it's just like you hear that thing 
saying and you're like,

1902
01:27:46,731 --> 01:27:48,440
Whoa,
you can't kill that.

1903
01:27:48,510 --> 01:27:50,000
I,
that's like a water person.

1904
01:27:50,660 --> 01:27:54,670
It's like a weird water person.
What does that see?

1905
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:56,720
Separate catches jet gold go larger with
that.

1906
01:27:56,721 --> 01:27:58,640
So it gets,
it just catches Japanese.

1907
01:27:58,641 --> 01:27:59,780
Sweet.
Oh my God.

1908
01:27:59,810 --> 01:28:00,643
Look it up.
That's just where they slaughtered the 

1909
01:28:02,691 --> 01:28:04,340
whales in there.
Oh,

1910
01:28:04,341 --> 01:28:05,450
that's fucked up,
dude.

1911
01:28:05,451 --> 01:28:07,130
Look,
you can see the whale parts and shit.

1912
01:28:08,810 --> 01:28:09,643
It's just a look at those three big ass 
wheels sitting on the floor of this 

1913
01:28:14,571 --> 01:28:16,790
Japanese vessel.
This is a real recent too.

1914
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:19,410
Yeah.
Japanese fleets.

1915
01:28:19,411 --> 01:28:21,950
He Click on that link so we can hear 
what the story is.

1916
01:28:24,830 --> 01:28:29,000
Sees Shepard Catches Japanese Fleet for 
Wales dead man.

1917
01:28:30,250 --> 01:28:31,083
Okay.

1918
01:28:31,270 --> 01:28:32,103
Yeah.
I mean,

1919
01:28:32,590 --> 01:28:35,200
as many as these people go out and catch
doing this,

1920
01:28:35,201 --> 01:28:36,034
a catch in the act.
How many people are getting away with 

1921
01:28:38,981 --> 01:28:40,950
this?
The ocean's a big fucking place.

1922
01:28:40,951 --> 01:28:42,610
Sea Shepherd only has so many boats.

1923
01:28:44,150 --> 01:28:45,960
Ooh,
horrible,

1924
01:28:45,961 --> 01:28:47,610
Huh?
Yeah,

1925
01:28:47,620 --> 01:28:49,860

is it illegal in Japan,

1926
01:28:50,070 --> 01:28:52,740
they've found inside a southern ocean 
sanctuary.

1927
01:28:52,950 --> 01:28:53,783
Sea Shepherd said that it had located 
all five Japanese vessels now in 

1928
01:28:56,821 --> 01:28:57,654
pursuit,
forcing the harpooners to cut short 

1929
01:28:59,431 --> 01:29:00,264
their operation and retreat.
The group released footage and 

1930
01:29:02,881 --> 01:29:03,714

whales dead on the deck of the factory

1934
01:29:18,030 --> 01:29:21,330
There's three carcasses on the ship.
A fourth carcass has been cut up.

1935
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:22,433
There's blood all over the place.
The meats carted around on this true 

1936
01:29:25,681 --> 01:29:28,010
ship deck.
Awful.

1937
01:29:28,011 --> 01:29:28,844
I don't know what awful.
A O F f a l n innards being dumped in

1939
01:29:35,480 --> 01:29:39,320
chairman Bob Brown.
And this is from 2014.

1940
01:29:39,350 --> 01:29:40,740
Is that what it's from?
Yeah,

mis.
They kill whales.

1942
01:29:43,940 --> 01:29:44,773
They're there.
There's something about that thing that 

1943
01:29:47,450 --> 01:29:51,630
just that like listening to that sound.
I don't think I ever heard that before.

1944
01:29:52,410 --> 01:29:53,730
If I did,
I never really listened.

1945
01:29:54,840 --> 01:29:58,780
That's a,
that's freaky man.

1946
01:29:58,810 --> 01:30:00,250
That's just,
that's a freaky sound.

1947
01:30:00,380 --> 01:30:02,030
Did you ever see that video of those,
um,

1948
01:30:02,540 --> 01:30:03,373

1950
01:30:10,340 --> 01:30:13,070
that's when you get a sense of how 
fucking big whales are.

1951
01:30:13,310 --> 01:30:16,070
These people are in this,
I dunno how deep they are,

1952
01:30:16,071 --> 01:30:16,904
but they're deep in this giant ass 
fucking whale come swimming right by 

1953
01:30:20,781 --> 01:30:22,840

Like right up to the side of the craft.

1954
01:30:22,841 --> 01:30:24,380
They're like,

1955
01:30:24,830 --> 01:30:28,100

I forget what kind of,
some kind of a submarine.

1959
01:30:38,420 --> 01:30:43,270
Some kind of underwater expedition 
vehicle and the submarine.

She said that to me on the twitter.

1986
01:31:53,470 --> 01:31:58,470
It's a bio luminescent shark that lives 
over a thousand feet under water.

1987
01:32:00,310 --> 01:32:01,480
Yeah.
This is the ghost shark.

Yeah.
Go Shark.

1992
01:32:11,290 --> 01:32:12,123
How crazy is that when you could find 
something alive today that was 

1993
01:32:15,700 --> 01:32:19,090
absolutely alive.
65 plus million years ago.

1994
01:32:19,510 --> 01:32:22,030
What a,
what an amazing time we live in.

1995
01:32:22,031 --> 01:32:22,864
We can get a glimpse of that and just 
sort of use your shitty little monkey 

1996
01:32:25,901 --> 01:32:29,440
brain to try to figure out like how many
different forms of life are there?

1997
01:32:29,740 --> 01:32:31,000
Like how,

1998
01:32:31,300 --> 01:32:34,150

Look at that thing.

2014

01:33:23,681 --> 01:33:26,050
Probably for finding prey.
What is that?

2019

2053
01:34:40,100 --> 01:34:41,420
Because that's the thing it says right 
here.

2054
01:34:41,421 --> 01:34:43,520
It's just a halibut and looks like a 
cyclops.

2055
01:34:44,290 --> 01:34:45,560
Yeah.
So that's a halibut.

01:34:58,460 --> 01:35:01,220
it looks like a cyclops cause you know,
you know what habits are.

2064
01:35:01,221 --> 01:35:03,110
They're flat and they have the eyeballs 
on one side.

2067
01:35:08,480 --> 01:35:09,313
We pulled up like how did this evolve?
That way they get to a spot and the 

2068
01:35:12,501 --> 01:35:13,334
ocean they lay down on the sand and then
they shake themselves and they become 

2069
01:35:16,371 --> 01:35:17,204
one with the sand.
Like they put sand all over their body 

2070
01:35:19,221 --> 01:35:21,710
and only their eyeballs poke up.
You ever see that?

2071
01:35:22,790 --> 01:35:25,130
It's crazy.
Like how the Fuck Whoa,

2072
01:35:25,131 --> 01:35:25,964
look at that thing.

2073
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:27,060
Yeah.

2074
01:35:27,060 --> 01:35:29,940
How that sandwich,
they don't google that.

2075
01:35:30,690 --> 01:35:33,480
How bit in the sense see watch.
You can see how it does it.

2076
01:35:33,510 --> 01:35:34,343
It's crazy when you watch them do it 
cause they just swimming along and they 

2077
01:35:37,201 --> 01:35:41,450
find a spot and they pound on the sand 
until it covers them.

2078
01:35:41,451 --> 01:35:42,300
I'm looking at this,
it's great

2079
01:35:43,640 --> 01:35:47,390
and that's how he hides.
What a weird creature.

2080
01:35:47,930 --> 01:35:51,260
When they have the two eyeballs on one 
side and the other side,

2081
01:35:51,261 --> 01:35:55,760
no eyeballs and they're flat like that 
is a weird looking animal dude.

2082
01:35:55,790 --> 01:35:56,623
It's so weird.
It's eyeballs or poking up and it's a 

2083
01:35:59,571 --> 01:36:01,460
Predator too,
which is even weirder.

2084
01:36:02,330 --> 01:36:03,163
I mean,
that's not something that's like eating 

2085
01:36:03,771 --> 01:36:04,604
plants and shit.
It's waiting for something to fuck up 

2086
01:36:05,931 --> 01:36:08,640
and get near it.
Look at Jack them like this.

2087
01:36:08,641 --> 01:36:13,010
This is a weird camouflage method and 
they're delicious.

2088
01:36:13,730 --> 01:36:15,590
I'm not a fish guy at all.
Really?

2089
01:36:15,620 --> 01:36:16,180
Yeah.
I,

2090
01:36:16,180 --> 01:36:18,620
I think I need to get that something,
I need to get into it older.

2091
01:36:18,621 --> 01:36:23,060
I get the type thing because I,
I hate fish and I just hate the taste of

2092
01:36:23,061 --> 01:36:24,620
fish.
I like hard shell,

2093
01:36:24,650 --> 01:36:26,070
like lobster.
Yeah.

2094
01:36:26,220 --> 01:36:27,770
Stuff like that.
But fish,

2095
01:36:27,830 --> 01:36:29,860
unless it's cooked delicious,
Lee,

2096
01:36:30,040 --> 01:36:31,790
which most of the time it's just fish.

2097
01:36:32,210 --> 01:36:33,043
Uh,
I can't get into it at all if it's just 

2098
01:36:34,671 --> 01:36:38,180
something that like if you go to like a 
Chili's or something like that,

2099
01:36:38,210 --> 01:36:39,380
right.
And you order fish,

2100
01:36:39,410 --> 01:36:40,970
it's probably not going to be so hot.
Right.

2101
01:36:40,980 --> 01:36:41,813
Right.
But if you go to like a fish place in 

2102
01:36:43,821 --> 01:36:44,654
order to fish,
I mean,

2103
01:36:44,690 --> 01:36:46,760
what do I know?
Maybe Chile's are the best fish ever.

2104
01:36:47,120 --> 01:36:49,250
Maybe I'm just a Snob,
but I'm like,

2105
01:36:49,251 --> 01:36:51,160
they can't fuck up chicken breasts.
You know,

2106
01:36:51,410 --> 01:36:53,570
chicken breasts are pretty fucking 
simple,

2107
01:36:54,110 --> 01:36:57,710
but if your fish is old at all or weird 
at all,

2108
01:36:58,280 --> 01:37:00,560
no Sushi on Sundays because they can't 
ship it.

2109
01:37:01,010 --> 01:37:02,780
Never go get fish on Sunday.
Yeah,

2110
01:37:02,781 --> 01:37:04,990
they say even is a bit of a problem.
Yeah.

2111
01:37:06,140 --> 01:37:07,700
I don't know when the right thing,
it's like an old rule.

2112
01:37:07,701 --> 01:37:11,030
They probably can ship stuff on Sundays.
Now I get deliveries on Amazon prime.

2113
01:37:11,031 --> 01:37:15,290
Does he get deliveries on Sunday?
Yeah.

2114
01:37:15,990 --> 01:37:17,930
Nobody's more arrest.
Not Mail.

2115
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:21,800
No more rest for anybody.
They're going to come to a time and it's

2116
01:37:21,801 --> 01:37:24,740
not that far in the future where there's
no more truck drivers.

2117
01:37:25,610 --> 01:37:27,440
I was,
I've been reading a lot about this man.

2118
01:37:27,441 --> 01:37:30,950
This is weird.
The number one job for white men in this

2119
01:37:30,951 --> 01:37:32,210
country is truck driver.

2120
01:37:33,140 --> 01:37:33,760
Wow.

2121
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:36,970
I made that up.
I was going to say,

2122
01:37:36,980 --> 01:37:40,210
wow.
I would believe it.

2123
01:37:40,840 --> 01:37:41,471
No,
but it's something.

2124
01:37:41,471 --> 01:37:42,304
It is high,
but I did make that up and close this 

2125
01:37:43,311 --> 01:37:44,144
one.
Or if they are going away for sure 

2126
01:37:44,890 --> 01:37:45,723
they're going away 100%.
Find out how many people drive trucks 

2127
01:37:47,801 --> 01:37:50,860
because it's something,
it's some amazing statistic.

2128
01:37:51,130 --> 01:37:52,770
Like how many,
I think it's the number.

2129
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:53,633
I do believe it's the number one job for
men is truck driver and the window 

2130
01:37:58,170 --> 01:38:02,520
transportation in the US or the world.
US to be a truck driving woman.

2131
01:38:02,700 --> 01:38:05,100
What's that guy to be a slut?
I'm just now I'm just,

2132
01:38:05,101 --> 01:38:07,020
that was a joke.
But like what do you have to be like?

2133
01:38:07,021 --> 01:38:07,854
That's a,
that's a weird person going to like to 

2134
01:38:09,931 --> 01:38:12,450
be around dudes.
Miss been like a family thing there.

2135
01:38:12,470 --> 01:38:15,050
Approximately 3.5
million professional truck drivers.

2136
01:38:15,070 --> 01:38:16,860
The United States.
According to estimates,

2137
01:38:16,890 --> 01:38:17,723
American trucking association,
total number of people enjoyed employed 

2138
01:38:20,341 --> 01:38:20,820
by the,
uh,

2139
01:38:20,820 --> 01:38:23,490
in the industry,
including those in positions that do not

2140
01:38:23,491 --> 01:38:25,950
until driving exceeds 8.7
million.

2141
01:38:26,330 --> 01:38:27,420
Um,
wow.

2142
01:38:27,480 --> 01:38:30,930
Find out what percentage though,
what percentage of men,

2143
01:38:32,280 --> 01:38:33,113
uh,
like instead of how many truck drivers 

2144
01:38:34,591 --> 01:38:37,860
in the u f saying what percentage of men
working driving trucks?

2145
01:38:38,690 --> 01:38:40,320
Uh,
uh,

2146
01:38:41,130 --> 01:38:42,840
uh,
that's a bad question.

2147
01:38:42,841 --> 01:38:45,150
I'm not answering it right and not 
asking it right.

2148
01:38:45,630 --> 01:38:46,463
Like,
um,

2149
01:38:46,830 --> 01:38:51,180
percentage of men that drive trucks for 
a living.

2150
01:38:51,270 --> 01:38:53,220
Proof of that percentage of male truck 
drivers,

2151
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:54,541
percentage of,
yeah.

2152
01:38:54,541 --> 01:38:55,374
Percentage of men who drive trucks for a
living topped out at 20% are women of 

2153
01:39:00,061 --> 01:39:00,894
all trucks hours.
When this article he expects about 10% 

2154
01:39:04,051 --> 01:39:06,390
of the freights,
9,000

2155
01:39:06,660 --> 01:39:07,493
haulers to be women,
which is almost twice the national 

2156
01:39:09,091 --> 01:39:10,530
average.
So that's double.

2157
01:39:10,531 --> 01:39:12,930
The national average is about 20% are 
right.

2158
01:39:13,040 --> 01:39:16,380
But is that the NAF national average for
any job or for truck driving?

2159
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:18,330
For truck driving.
Okay.

2160
01:39:18,630 --> 01:39:22,470
So let's find out what the percentage of
people that drive trucks are.

2161
01:39:23,050 --> 01:39:24,120
Because I think for men,
just,

2162
01:39:24,210 --> 01:39:27,430
just google what percentage of men drive
trucks right here?

2163
01:39:27,450 --> 01:39:29,490
A 5.8%
of the 3.4

2164
01:39:29,491 --> 01:39:31,140
million truck drivers last year were 
women.

2165
01:39:32,190 --> 01:39:33,780
Okay.
So 3.4

2166
01:39:33,781 --> 01:39:38,781
million truck drivers and that's from 
2010 or 2011 compared to 4.6%

2167
01:39:40,681 --> 01:39:41,880
in 2010.
Huh.

2168
01:39:41,910 --> 01:39:45,540
So that's saying it's declining.
2% are fuckable as this,

2169
01:39:46,500 --> 01:39:47,333
I think it's one to 5.8%
of the 34 million truck drivers last 

2170
01:39:52,690 --> 01:39:55,470
year as compared to the 4.6%.
Okay.

2171
01:39:55,780 --> 01:39:59,460
So there's more female truck drivers now
and it's not 4.6

2172
01:39:59,461 --> 01:40:00,090
million.
I'm reading,

2173
01:40:00,090 --> 01:40:00,923
I'm reading it wrong that most female 
checkers working two person driving 

2174
01:40:03,121 --> 01:40:06,240
teams.
Good move mother daughter pairings.

2175
01:40:06,270 --> 01:40:06,711
Yeah,
that's,

2176
01:40:06,711 --> 01:40:08,370
that's a good move.
Stay safe.

2177
01:40:08,410 --> 01:40:09,780
Lesbians.
Keep a gun.

2178
01:40:10,470 --> 01:40:12,080
Don't say Lesbians Brow.
They just know.

2179
01:40:12,090 --> 01:40:13,320
I bet.
I bet they the,

2180
01:40:13,321 --> 01:40:14,154
that's a big thing.
You know they would like being on the 

2181
01:40:16,891 --> 01:40:18,690
road together.
Go on a road trips,

2182
01:40:18,691 --> 01:40:19,470
having fun here.

2183
01:40:19,470 --> 01:40:21,510
Lesbian.
And maybe what if you start fighting?

2184
01:40:21,780 --> 01:40:23,640
What have you like halfway across the 
Goddamn country,

2185
01:40:23,641 --> 01:40:24,474
you gotta make the next 2000 miles.
This bitch who won't even eat your ass 

2186
01:40:27,661 --> 01:40:30,060
anymore.
I'm so tired of her bullshit.

2187
01:40:30,840 --> 01:40:32,190
Oh,
you think you're too good for me?

2188
01:40:33,210 --> 01:40:34,270
This is,
um,

2189
01:40:34,950 --> 01:40:35,783
it's a weird time when it comes to those
people because those jobs are gonna go 

2190
01:40:37,711 --> 01:40:39,810
away.
They're going to have automated trucks.

2191
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:40,800
All jobs.
Yeah.

2192
01:40:41,310 --> 01:40:42,143
Fast food.
Fast food's going to go away before 

2193
01:40:43,830 --> 01:40:44,663
trucker's cashiers.
I think the cashiers are going to go 

2194
01:40:47,131 --> 01:40:47,610
away.
Sure.

2195
01:40:47,610 --> 01:40:49,650
But I don't think truckers,
I think it's going to,

2196
01:40:49,651 --> 01:40:51,870
I think the trucker thing's going to 
happen sooner than you think.

2197
01:40:51,871 --> 01:40:54,130
They already started using these drone 
trucks,

2198
01:40:54,130 --> 01:40:55,000
right?
Thanks.

2199
01:40:55,450 --> 01:40:56,283
Yeah.
I think they've already started using 

2200
01:40:56,811 --> 01:40:58,530
them.
In some places it's a,

2201
01:40:58,980 --> 01:41:01,660
you're going to have to figure out a way
to employ those people.

2202
01:41:01,720 --> 01:41:04,930
You've got millions of people,
millions of people that don't have a job

2203
01:41:04,931 --> 01:41:08,390
anymore because I'm,

2204
01:41:09,130 --> 01:41:13,180
but there is there more jobs opening up 
of things like twitchers youtubers,

2205
01:41:13,510 --> 01:41:14,343
you know,

2206
01:41:14,530 --> 01:41:16,030
be,
if they could figure out how to do it.

2207
01:41:16,540 --> 01:41:19,570
But I mean,
not everybody figures out how to do it.

2208
01:41:19,571 --> 01:41:22,390
That even does it.
How many people figure out how to make a

2209
01:41:22,391 --> 01:41:23,710
living off of,
uh,

2210
01:41:23,770 --> 01:41:25,870
doing anything on the Internet.
You know,

2211
01:41:25,871 --> 01:41:26,704
even people that do it,
how many people that are on like 

2212
01:41:28,360 --> 01:41:29,950
instagram,
they do it all the time.

2213
01:41:29,951 --> 01:41:31,810
They do it all day.
How many people are making nothing?

2214
01:41:32,390 --> 01:41:34,330
You know,
zero lot.

2215
01:41:34,390 --> 01:41:35,223
They just do it because it's fun.
They haven't figured out how to profit 

2216
01:41:37,151 --> 01:41:37,984
off of it.
You can't just expect these truck 

2217
01:41:39,611 --> 01:41:42,580
drivers to figure it out.
It's like they're going to be,

2218
01:41:42,581 --> 01:41:43,750
what the fuck,
man,

2219
01:41:43,960 --> 01:41:47,620
there's no jobs left.
That was a legitimate job,

2220
01:41:47,650 --> 01:41:48,483
but get out of school,
there was always these commercials for 

2221
01:41:49,691 --> 01:41:52,420
truck company's truck driving companies.
We need drivers.

2222
01:41:52,421 --> 01:41:54,010
Do you have a safe record and you're 
like,

2223
01:41:54,011 --> 01:41:55,000
man,
I'm going to be a driver.

2224
01:41:55,390 --> 01:41:57,310
You can earn $16 an hour and you're 
like,

2225
01:41:57,340 --> 01:41:58,510
oh shit.
16 an hour.

2226
01:41:58,870 --> 01:42:01,630
You know all those commercials,
those are going away.

2227
01:42:01,990 --> 01:42:03,100
The job that doesn't exist,

2228
01:42:03,330 --> 01:42:05,320
probably drone drivers now or something 
like that.

2229
01:42:06,190 --> 01:42:07,840
Even though those are going to be 
automated too,

2230
01:42:07,841 --> 01:42:11,480
you're going to send those things like a
navigation signal for awhile.

2231
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:15,730
You'll need people to fix it.
It's a fixed PCR repair till robots know

2232
01:42:15,731 --> 01:42:17,860
how to do it better than you can for 
awhile.

2233
01:42:17,890 --> 01:42:19,270
Fuck man,
there's too many of us.

2234
01:42:19,540 --> 01:42:23,290
We out fucked our resources.
Maybe that's what's going on.

2235
01:42:23,291 --> 01:42:23,940
We've got to back off.

2236
01:42:23,940 --> 01:42:24,773
Fuck.
I wonder if it's going to get to the 

2237
01:42:25,801 --> 01:42:26,634
point where like,
you know like chain restaurants like 

2238
01:42:28,350 --> 01:42:30,570
Chili's or whatever,
like in the back they have,

2239
01:42:30,780 --> 01:42:32,580
they're going to need just like not even
have cooks.

2240
01:42:32,581 --> 01:42:35,580
It's just going to be like plate comps,
squirt the Alfredo,

2241
01:42:35,581 --> 01:42:37,840
squirt the noodle,
you know it's going to be longer.

2242
01:42:38,150 --> 01:42:41,570
We're going to use that meat material 
and make it with a three d printer,

2243
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:45,130
like westworld style when they're making
the body,

2244
01:42:47,360 --> 01:42:49,310
put your fucking New York Strip together
that way.

2245
01:42:50,330 --> 01:42:51,163
I wonder if it's going to be better.
Imagine if you like you make meat in a 

2246
01:42:53,331 --> 01:42:56,720
factory and it's never been worked out.
So it's like super attend.

2247
01:42:56,730 --> 01:42:59,030
Are you biting through here?
Like oh my God.

2248
01:42:59,330 --> 01:43:00,163
And they figured out how manipulated.
So it was like double the protein 15 

2249
01:43:03,111 --> 01:43:03,944
times the iron.

2250
01:43:03,970 --> 01:43:04,900
No.
And the Matrix,

2251
01:43:04,901 --> 01:43:06,490
that guy had left the matrix and he's 
like,

2252
01:43:06,491 --> 01:43:08,440
I don't give a fuck if the steak tastes 
like,

2253
01:43:08,680 --> 01:43:10,850
I know it's fake,
but I want it to,

2254
01:43:11,020 --> 01:43:14,110
I want that fucking fake taste of butter
right now.

2255
01:43:14,250 --> 01:43:15,390
Yeah.
He knew it was fake,

2256
01:43:15,420 --> 01:43:17,220
but he didn't care cause it tasted 
amazing.

2257
01:43:17,221 --> 01:43:19,170
Yeah.
That's might be going on right now.

2258
01:43:19,920 --> 01:43:22,170
Might be going on right now.
It's entirely possible.

2259
01:43:22,171 --> 01:43:24,090
We're in the matrix.
I think so.

2260
01:43:24,510 --> 01:43:25,343
I know you do.

2261
01:43:26,560 --> 01:43:30,470
Finally I finally killed my other rat or
I got the,

2262
01:43:30,530 --> 01:43:32,010
I got no,
I didn't kill it back.

2263
01:43:32,011 --> 01:43:33,540
Got it out of my house.
I can't get it out.

2264
01:43:33,880 --> 01:43:36,320
It got trapped.
The first rap,

2265
01:43:36,340 --> 01:43:37,500
uh,
broke his neck,

2266
01:43:37,530 --> 01:43:38,850
you know,
second wrap.

2267
01:43:38,940 --> 01:43:40,600
Got his leg trapped.
Yeah.

2268
01:43:40,630 --> 01:43:42,560
You saw that and uh,
and yeah,

2269
01:43:42,690 --> 01:43:44,580
it hasn't been back since the back.
He might be dead.

2270
01:43:44,610 --> 01:43:48,660
My Dad said that if you,
if a rat sees another rat get hurt or it

2271
01:43:48,661 --> 01:43:52,160
gets hurting a rat cage,
they automatically know never to go back

2272
01:43:52,161 --> 01:43:53,660
there again.
Like never date.

2273
01:43:54,080 --> 01:43:54,913
That's why they're so hard to catch 
because if they see another wrap in a 

2274
01:43:56,631 --> 01:43:57,830
trap,
right in a trap,

2275
01:43:57,890 --> 01:43:58,910
they know go.
All right,

2276
01:43:58,970 --> 01:44:00,500
don't touch that silver thing,
you know?

2277
01:44:01,150 --> 01:44:02,060
Yeah.
It makes sense.

2278
01:44:02,270 --> 01:44:03,660
I saw that video that you put off 
though.

2279
01:44:03,661 --> 01:44:04,494
It was crazy dude.
Audio audio of that mouse screaming and 

2280
01:44:07,681 --> 01:44:09,350
that's like a monkey,
doesn't it sound like a monkey?

2281
01:44:09,351 --> 01:44:10,280
Yeah.
Listen to this.

2282
01:44:10,281 --> 01:44:12,230
We'll crank it up.
Crank that volume up.

2283
01:44:13,340 --> 01:44:15,840
There it is.
There's this little island like that

2284
01:44:16,220 --> 01:44:17,053
out.

2285
01:44:23,060 --> 01:44:25,070
So it's freaking out.
It's got its leg trap.

2286
01:44:25,071 --> 01:44:25,904
Does that,
what's the lag is trapped at home when 

2287
01:44:28,640 --> 01:44:29,600
that happened?
No,

2288
01:44:29,630 --> 01:44:31,760
my girlfriend was and she was texting me
Brian,

2289
01:44:31,790 --> 01:44:36,200
there's a monkey in the kitchen now it 
goes back up

2290
01:44:36,240 --> 01:44:40,970
and this is the last time I ever see me.
He goes into my cupboard and so that's a

2291
01:44:40,971 --> 01:44:42,210
hole in the cupboard?
Yeah.

2292
01:44:42,220 --> 01:44:43,310
That's how you catching them?
Yeah.

2293
01:44:43,390 --> 01:44:44,223
Oh,
so that's all contained inside the some 

2294
01:44:45,240 --> 01:44:46,073
little box.
So he was getting in there and eating 

2295
01:44:46,891 --> 01:44:49,410
your food.
He didn't get to eat any of my food.

2296
01:44:49,411 --> 01:44:51,360
He could only get underneath my kitchen 
sink.

2297
01:44:51,720 --> 01:44:54,480
But when we opened up the kitchen sink 
after we found out we had rats,

2298
01:44:54,510 --> 01:44:57,510
all our cleaning supplies have been 
drank and ate.

2299
01:44:57,550 --> 01:44:58,383
Oh,
why are you showing me different things 

2300
01:44:58,891 --> 01:44:59,790
back and forth?
Hold on,

2301
01:44:59,820 --> 01:45:00,720
hold us to this.
A different,

2302
01:45:00,910 --> 01:45:01,980
this,
a different camera angle,

2303
01:45:02,010 --> 01:45:03,640
but hold on.
Don't distract me.

2304
01:45:03,641 --> 01:45:05,190
Like tell me what your shut,
what is this one?

2305
01:45:05,270 --> 01:45:07,320
I was just getting back to that cause I 
was him talking in the middle.

2306
01:45:07,321 --> 01:45:08,154
I was getting off of that.

2307
01:45:08,260 --> 01:45:11,040
So this is another rat now this is that 
same one different camera.

2308
01:45:11,490 --> 01:45:12,001
Oh,
okay.

2309
01:45:12,001 --> 01:45:13,980
So did you get a camera with the rat?
We killed it.

2310
01:45:14,540 --> 01:45:15,373
Yeah,
we have photos of that and yeah we have 

2311
01:45:17,190 --> 01:45:20,370
the video wasn't as good though,
but the photos are pretty cool.

2312
01:45:20,460 --> 01:45:23,070
So when he jumps through he's heard it 
all.

2313
01:45:23,400 --> 01:45:24,750
Yeah,
but he hasn't been back.

2314
01:45:25,770 --> 01:45:30,770
But what's weird is that day they drank 
and ate all my cleaning supplies.

2315
01:45:31,320 --> 01:45:32,153
And so like there was a thing of bleach 
that had been eaten through and drank 

2316
01:45:35,150 --> 01:45:35,983
watts.
So they had been living off my cleaning 

2317
01:45:37,471 --> 01:45:39,510
supplies.
The eight bleach?

2318
01:45:39,511 --> 01:45:40,740
Yeah.
All my shit.

2319
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:44,850
Ammonia uh,
wax for your floors.

2320
01:45:45,120 --> 01:45:47,340
Floors.
It's all gone.

2321
01:45:47,430 --> 01:45:49,440
And there's just a hole in it where they
had drank at all.

2322
01:45:49,450 --> 01:45:51,540
And what the fuck?
Yeah.

2323
01:45:52,350 --> 01:45:53,220
Wait a minute.
Google.

2324
01:45:53,221 --> 01:45:55,200
What can rats eat?
Can Rats eat?

2325
01:45:55,201 --> 01:45:56,160
Cleaning?
Surprise.

2326
01:45:56,490 --> 01:45:57,060
I think.

2327
01:45:57,060 --> 01:45:59,070
I think they're pretty much,
you can't kill a rat.

2328
01:45:59,280 --> 01:46:03,330
And watching them the last three weeks 
was just amazing,

2329
01:46:03,331 --> 01:46:04,164
seeing how smart they are.
And have you seen that Morgan spurlock 

2330
01:46:05,821 --> 01:46:08,370
movie rats on Netflix,
but awesome.

2331
01:46:08,400 --> 01:46:09,780
Yeah.
And just the trailer,

2332
01:46:09,810 --> 01:46:10,381
they're like,
they're,

2333
01:46:10,381 --> 01:46:11,214
they're,
they're saying and how rats are getting 

2334
01:46:11,671 --> 01:46:13,710
smarter.
They're about to overtake us.

2335
01:46:13,770 --> 01:46:16,290
And I believe it though,
just watching my rack,

2336
01:46:16,320 --> 01:46:18,870
I always obsessed with them.
I was watching him all night.

2337
01:46:18,871 --> 01:46:19,950
I had three camera,
shoot,

2338
01:46:20,040 --> 01:46:21,120
Morgan,
don't be so silly.

2339
01:46:21,480 --> 01:46:23,670
But yeah,
that's a horrible feeling.

2340
01:46:23,671 --> 01:46:26,580
Having rats in your house.
And I've had it before.

2341
01:46:26,670 --> 01:46:27,570
Yeah.
I want him.

2342
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:28,860
I want to move,
even though they're gone.

2343
01:46:28,861 --> 01:46:29,694
I just don't want to be in that house.
And I would tell you the rat in my 

2344
01:46:31,651 --> 01:46:32,810
garage story,
no,

2345
01:46:32,970 --> 01:46:34,860
from Encino.
And I lived in Encino,

2346
01:46:34,910 --> 01:46:37,110
a kill a rat in my garage.
Put this trap up.

2347
01:46:37,140 --> 01:46:39,940
That's where I used to keep my trash,
kept it in the barrels and the garage,

2348
01:46:39,941 --> 01:46:41,790
and then take it out in the morning 
right when you're supposed to.

2349
01:46:42,870 --> 01:46:45,590
I fucking killed this rat.
It dies in the,

2350
01:46:45,591 --> 01:46:47,490
in the trap.
I look at it,

2351
01:46:47,491 --> 01:46:48,930
it's a big fucking Rad.
I was,

2352
01:46:49,110 --> 01:46:50,190
Whoa,
that thing's

2353
01:46:50,190 --> 01:46:50,851
huge.
I was like,

2354
01:46:50,851 --> 01:46:51,630
all right,
I don't,

2355
01:46:51,630 --> 01:46:53,640
I'm lazy.
I don't feel like taking care of it now.

2356
01:46:53,641 --> 01:46:54,900
I'm going to go take care of it in the 
morning.

2357
01:46:55,050 --> 01:46:56,550
So I wake up in the morning and go out 
there.

2358
01:46:56,940 --> 01:46:59,310
It's eaten.
They ate him.

2359
01:46:59,520 --> 01:47:03,390
I mean they ate him down to the tail.
All that was left was the tail.

2360
01:47:03,430 --> 01:47:04,590
She's,
and I was like,

2361
01:47:04,591 --> 01:47:06,990
Holy Shit.
First of all,

2362
01:47:06,991 --> 01:47:09,780
it taught me,
even rats when eat rat tails,

2363
01:47:09,900 --> 01:47:10,780
which is interesting,
right.

2364
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:15,800
Tells me this tastes like rat ate his 
friends asshole.

2365
01:47:16,290 --> 01:47:18,670
He got to the tail is like enough with 
the,

2366
01:47:18,950 --> 01:47:22,350
I draw the culinary line.
Like they,

2367
01:47:22,351 --> 01:47:25,280
I mean they ate the fuck out of this rat
when I tell you that.

2368
01:47:25,281 --> 01:47:26,114
It was like almost none of it left,
but it was like there was still meet 

2369
01:47:29,010 --> 01:47:30,900
that was trapped in the,
um,

2370
01:47:31,350 --> 01:47:33,930
in the jaws of the mouse trap,
the rat traps.

2371
01:47:33,930 --> 01:47:37,050
So he could tell that he had,
it wasn't like it was all gone.

2372
01:47:37,230 --> 01:47:39,300
Like there was a lot left for,
you could tell they ate them,

2373
01:47:40,110 --> 01:47:42,300
but it was like they had eaten almost 
everything.

2374
01:47:42,980 --> 01:47:45,090
He'll all the innards gone.
Fucked up.

2375
01:47:45,110 --> 01:47:45,943
Eye Balls gone face gone.
They just ate the fuck out of their 

2376
01:47:48,991 --> 01:47:49,824
friend,
ate the fuck out of him and he did it 

2377
01:47:51,050 --> 01:47:51,883
overnight.
I don't know how many rats were in 

2378
01:47:53,011 --> 01:47:55,290
there,
but it's a fat ass rat.

2379
01:47:55,410 --> 01:47:56,243
Think about if you had to you,
me and Jamie had to eat a whole person 

2380
01:47:58,431 --> 01:48:00,160
at night.
She says,

2381
01:48:00,450 --> 01:48:02,220
I'll fucking,
how could you eat them?

2382
01:48:02,490 --> 01:48:04,140
How much?
How much meat is that?

2383
01:48:04,141 --> 01:48:04,974
That's insane.
Like how many rats are there that they 

2384
01:48:07,021 --> 01:48:11,040
ate my whole rat in one night.
I mean you'd have to like,

2385
01:48:11,070 --> 01:48:12,810
okay,
if you had to eat a person,

2386
01:48:13,260 --> 01:48:15,120
you,
and if the three of us,

2387
01:48:15,680 --> 01:48:16,513
you know how to recruit a bunch of 
people to help us eat someone the size 

2388
01:48:19,381 --> 01:48:21,720
of Tony Hinchcliffe not a big person.

2389
01:48:21,780 --> 01:48:26,780
Take an hour.
No take fucking weeks to do it.

2390
01:48:26,851 --> 01:48:27,684
The bones were throw away the bone.
We would have to get like a hundred 

2391
01:48:29,731 --> 01:48:31,530
dudes to help us.
Yeah,

2392
01:48:31,560 --> 01:48:33,930
you throw away the bumps.
They ate through those fucking bones.

2393
01:48:33,960 --> 01:48:36,180
They ate,
they ate most of the bones.

2394
01:48:36,181 --> 01:48:40,180
How much meat can you eat?
A dinner like two pounds maybe may,

2395
01:48:40,181 --> 01:48:42,780
you might be able to force three pounds 
in your face,

2396
01:48:42,930 --> 01:48:43,763
but you're going to feel like shit.
So the equivalent for a rat is like you 

2397
01:48:47,641 --> 01:48:50,760
eating 50 pounds.
I didn't know they jumped so high.

2398
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:52,350
I didn't know that was a thing.
Right?

2399
01:48:52,420 --> 01:48:53,253
It's jumped high like two on topic to 
your counters and like that was fucked 

2400
01:48:56,041 --> 01:49:00,000
up dude saying that they're freaks.
They can scramble up things.

2401
01:49:00,060 --> 01:49:04,620
They'll attack you,
make out into my wall heater and fuck my

2402
01:49:04,710 --> 01:49:07,620
heater up and like blew the pilot out 
and did something.

2403
01:49:08,490 --> 01:49:11,970
Like they really fucked me up.
My dog like wouldn't leave my bedroom.

2404
01:49:12,030 --> 01:49:14,190
I wouldn't leave my God.
Dude.

2405
01:49:14,220 --> 01:49:18,060
Well think about a dog that's like 
having a rat and the size of a dog.

2406
01:49:18,280 --> 01:49:21,450
Imagine that like a rat the size of a 
German shepard living in your house.

2407
01:49:22,140 --> 01:49:26,640
I think that rats documentary started 
because they were a rat terrier thing.

2408
01:49:26,641 --> 01:49:27,474
There was that.
There's a group of people that take 

2409
01:49:28,141 --> 01:49:31,110
their little dogs,
Johnny Olson and they fuck up rats.

2410
01:49:31,140 --> 01:49:31,770
Yeah,
it's fine.

2411
01:49:31,770 --> 01:49:33,410
It looks fine.
Yeah.

2412
01:49:33,480 --> 01:49:34,770
Break their backs.
Don't even eat them.

2413
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:36,510
They just fuck it.
Do it like for fun.

2414
01:49:36,870 --> 01:49:38,670
Well that's what those dogs are designed
for.

2415
01:49:38,700 --> 01:49:41,760
They made those dogs in Europe.
I believe I might've made that up.

2416
01:49:42,150 --> 01:49:42,983
But uh,
they made those dogs just to go after 

2417
01:49:44,821 --> 01:49:45,990
rats.
Yeah,

2418
01:49:46,020 --> 01:49:47,680
I still have to get one.
Please Google.

2419
01:49:47,681 --> 01:49:49,990
What percentage of white men drive 
trucks?

2420
01:49:50,530 --> 01:49:51,850
I was,
I was driving me crazy.

2421
01:49:51,851 --> 01:49:54,610
I've got to find this out.
I was about to get cats again.

2422
01:49:54,670 --> 01:49:56,770
I was about to get that rat terror.
Call me up,

2423
01:49:56,771 --> 01:49:58,950
man.
I had come from borrow one here.

2424
01:49:58,951 --> 01:50:00,400
Now you can't,
you don't want a cat.

2425
01:50:00,520 --> 01:50:03,040
They shit in a box in your house cause 
awesome as they are.

2426
01:50:03,340 --> 01:50:05,140
And if you leave them out to kill the 
rat,

2427
01:50:05,250 --> 01:50:08,410
that's what I was going to have tony 
laid there with his butt up in his pants

2428
01:50:08,411 --> 01:50:11,230
down in the kitchen and consult wall,
Tony Hinchcliffe.

2429
01:50:11,510 --> 01:50:14,530
Don't get it.
I was not going to kill the cat.

2430
01:50:14,560 --> 01:50:16,570
Richard Gere.
Richard Gere,

2431
01:50:16,770 --> 01:50:20,590
like the rat would go in that,
but nevermind boy though is bad.

2432
01:50:21,690 --> 01:50:26,690
Jesus tried everything,
but you got rid of your rides.

2433
01:50:28,920 --> 01:50:29,680
I mean,
yeah,

2434
01:50:29,680 --> 01:50:32,020
you got up,
you got to do it right.

2435
01:50:32,380 --> 01:50:34,000
You got to kill him with fucking traps.

2436
01:50:34,060 --> 01:50:37,030
You gotta and you got to set out poison 
and you've got to have someone to do the

2437
01:50:37,031 --> 01:50:39,130
whole thing.
Otherwise they'll take over your fucking

2438
01:50:39,131 --> 01:50:39,964
place.
I think luckily for the last week and a 

2439
01:50:43,090 --> 01:50:44,230
half,
there hasn't been one rat.

2440
01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:46,930
So what's one reason why I'm pro coyote?
You know,

2441
01:50:46,931 --> 01:50:48,790
even though coyotes have eaten my 
chickens,

2442
01:50:48,820 --> 01:50:51,790
they've killed at least one that I know 
of that might've killed too.

2443
01:50:52,360 --> 01:50:53,193
I think that coyotes are super important
for keeping the rat population in check 

2444
01:50:56,111 --> 01:50:56,944
and the mouse population in check.
Somebody told me if we just had more 

2445
01:50:59,861 --> 01:51:03,550
Guinea pigs like live like that,
they would take care of all that.

2446
01:51:03,720 --> 01:51:04,553
Hmm.
Like Guinea pigs hate rats and mice and 

2447
01:51:07,150 --> 01:51:08,590
Guinea pigs.
This are kind of cool.

2448
01:51:08,620 --> 01:51:10,100
I wouldn't mind seeing those guys.
Well,

2449
01:51:10,101 --> 01:51:13,090
there was a show one anthony Bourdain's,
a old show.

2450
01:51:13,091 --> 01:51:18,091
He did an episode about this family that
lived in South America and apparently in

2451
01:51:19,001 --> 01:51:19,834
a lot of places,
Guinea pigs are eating on a regular 

2452
01:51:21,731 --> 01:51:23,620
basis and they keep them as pets.

2453
01:51:24,070 --> 01:51:26,530
So the entire floor of these people's 
house,

2454
01:51:26,531 --> 01:51:27,364
like where the kitchen is,
just Guinea pigs running all over the 

2455
01:51:29,561 --> 01:51:31,210
place since you grab one of them,
killed them,

2456
01:51:31,520 --> 01:51:32,600
Cook them up.
That's weird.

2457
01:51:32,650 --> 01:51:34,420
They're so stupid.
They don't even know their friend died.

2458
01:51:35,290 --> 01:51:37,510
Whereas Mikey,
they're not like rats.

2459
01:51:37,630 --> 01:51:40,180
They're just like their pets in there.
You know?

2460
01:51:40,390 --> 01:51:41,540
Even if you,
it's me,

2461
01:51:41,541 --> 01:51:42,730
it kind of,
it's kind of what you're doing.

2462
01:51:42,731 --> 01:51:44,660
If you kill chickens,
you know,

2463
01:51:44,661 --> 01:51:45,494
it was just,
these early is wandering around with 

2464
01:51:46,631 --> 01:51:47,464
you,
but they're well fed and then when the 

2465
01:51:50,051 --> 01:51:51,700
time is common,
the family needs to eat.

2466
01:51:51,701 --> 01:51:53,220
They just grabbed one of those 
motherfuckers.

2467
01:51:53,330 --> 01:51:54,370
I pick any pigs.
Good.

2468
01:51:54,910 --> 01:51:55,743
They look good the way they were cooking
and it looked like they've done it 

2469
01:51:57,311 --> 01:51:58,180
before.
All right.

2470
01:51:58,270 --> 01:52:00,280
It's probably super lean,
you know,

2471
01:52:00,281 --> 01:52:03,220
it's probably a lot like rabbit or 
something like that.

2472
01:52:04,900 --> 01:52:07,030
I don't like rabbit.
You know,

2473
01:52:07,090 --> 01:52:10,390
there's Mites that grow on rabbits that 
can kill you.

2474
01:52:10,990 --> 01:52:12,040
Oh really?
Yeah.

2475
01:52:12,220 --> 01:52:16,750
That if you get bitten by these Mites,
they carry diseases especially um,

2476
01:52:17,470 --> 01:52:20,440
like got jack rabbits like a lot of 
jackrabbits have them.

2477
01:52:20,890 --> 01:52:21,940
And if these,
uh,

2478
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,730
it's a really important to be careful 
because if you don't,

2479
01:52:24,820 --> 01:52:25,653
if you don't handle them with gloves or 
if you get them on your body and if you 

2480
01:52:27,941 --> 01:52:29,410
get the wrong kind of like,
you know,

2481
01:52:29,411 --> 01:52:31,930
like ticks carry lyme disease,
some ticks do,

2482
01:52:32,230 --> 01:52:36,280
some mites carry this horrible fucking 
disease that kills people.

2483
01:52:36,940 --> 01:52:39,760
And if you don't get antibiotics in you 
at the right time,

2484
01:52:39,761 --> 01:52:40,594
people have died from like killing a 
rabbit and eating it from the mites 

2485
01:52:43,871 --> 01:52:45,980
biting you.
Like what in the

2486
01:52:45,980 --> 01:52:46,813
fuck?
I was scared that this rat was going to 

2487
01:52:49,940 --> 01:52:53,350
like this rat jumped on Janice and my 
girlfriend is like,

2488
01:52:53,351 --> 01:52:55,040
it touched her like,
well we didn't,

2489
01:52:55,070 --> 01:52:55,903
we thought there was only one rat and 
then so we were like cleaning something 

2490
01:52:58,431 --> 01:52:59,264
out in the kitchen and she picked up 
like the Styrofoam thing and it was 

2491
01:53:01,281 --> 01:53:03,430
attached to the style of like what?
Like,

2492
01:53:03,470 --> 01:53:06,260
it wouldn't let go of it.
Like when she picked it up,

2493
01:53:07,040 --> 01:53:10,610
looked over at her and it just jumped.
And you know,

2494
01:53:10,611 --> 01:53:12,710
luckily it didn't bite her or anything 
like that.

2495
01:53:13,340 --> 01:53:16,910
What if it got caught in her hair and 
was just fucking chewing its way out?

2496
01:53:20,680 --> 01:53:22,820
Eddie if sent me,
he has rats right now.

2497
01:53:22,821 --> 01:53:27,821
He has a huge rat problem cause he lives
with Eddie lives in a very rural area.

2498
01:53:28,310 --> 01:53:29,870
Yeah.
Santa Monica mountains or something like

2499
01:53:29,871 --> 01:53:30,320
that.
Right.

2500
01:53:30,320 --> 01:53:31,153
Well where he is,
it's like this fucking coyotes and 

2501
01:53:33,321 --> 01:53:35,110
mountain lions and all kinds of shit.
Yeah.

2502
01:53:35,300 --> 01:53:37,250
What is that?
A keyboard touched on an ipad.

2503
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:38,630
Yeah.
Now why,

2504
01:53:38,720 --> 01:53:40,610
why that over a laptop?
Oh,

2505
01:53:40,611 --> 01:53:41,770
I use a laptop.
I just,

2506
01:53:41,840 --> 01:53:43,000
this is,
uh,

2507
01:53:43,030 --> 01:53:47,230
my dream for drawling like deejaying 
from like kill Tony and stuff like that.

2508
01:53:47,280 --> 01:53:49,580
I could pretty much do everything that I
can,

2509
01:53:49,820 --> 01:53:52,040
uh,
on this then my laptop.

2510
01:53:52,120 --> 01:53:53,750
Right.
But it doesn't have any storage.

2511
01:53:53,890 --> 01:53:54,400
Uh,
yeah,

2512
01:53:54,400 --> 01:53:55,233
it's got stores.
But I mean like you can't like make a 

2513
01:53:56,241 --> 01:53:57,260
file.
Right.

2514
01:53:57,290 --> 01:53:58,820
And like leave it on your desktop.
Right.

2515
01:53:59,170 --> 01:54:02,120
So there's certain things like that I 
need to do that for.

2516
01:54:02,120 --> 01:54:02,953
I had as a memory,
like you can store movies on it and Oh 

2517
01:54:04,761 --> 01:54:06,110
yeah.
Songs and stuff like that.

2518
01:54:06,111 --> 01:54:07,190
Yeah,
it's great.

2519
01:54:07,220 --> 01:54:08,300
I love this.
This is,

2520
01:54:08,420 --> 01:54:11,480
and you know the cool thing is is you 
could just carry it around like this.

2521
01:54:11,510 --> 01:54:14,090
You know,
it doesn't have to have the keyboard and

2522
01:54:14,120 --> 01:54:14,953
the stewardess doesn't give you a hard 
time when you're watching a movie like 

2523
01:54:17,211 --> 01:54:18,770
that.
But if you use the keyboard,

2524
01:54:18,800 --> 01:54:20,240
you're a bad person.
Right.

2525
01:54:20,570 --> 01:54:22,520
What the fuck is that about?
It makes no sense.

2526
01:54:22,550 --> 01:54:25,130
Like you have to close your laptop,
but you'll have to open up your tablet.

2527
01:54:25,550 --> 01:54:26,383
Explain how come,
how come I can hold onto a tablet and 

2528
01:54:29,710 --> 01:54:30,543
it's safe.
But if I'm messing around with the 

2529
01:54:32,481 --> 01:54:33,314
keyboard,
I might blow this fucker right out of 

2530
01:54:34,491 --> 01:54:36,260
the sky.
It makes zero sense.

2531
01:54:36,560 --> 01:54:39,350
You have to put away your laptop,
but you can hold onto your ipad.

2532
01:54:39,440 --> 01:54:41,000
What?
I'm going to white,

2533
01:54:41,001 --> 01:54:41,834
this laptop has such a huge brick.
Like that's cause it's a really good 

2534
01:54:44,721 --> 01:54:45,650
laptop.
Yeah.

2535
01:54:45,651 --> 01:54:47,930
But I mean if you get the lay windows,
I know,

2536
01:54:47,931 --> 01:54:51,710
but if you get the latest Mac book pro,
like the highest specs ever,

2537
01:54:51,711 --> 01:54:52,544
it doesn't have a break like that.
It has a little power thing but well I 

2538
01:54:55,371 --> 01:54:58,220
have a backup brick that's a smaller 
brick than that.

2539
01:54:58,490 --> 01:55:00,710
That's a big brick.
Oh No,

2540
01:55:00,920 --> 01:55:04,730
that's a brick I bought online because 
it is a Lenovo brick.

2541
01:55:04,731 --> 01:55:05,564
I think it just works on a lot of 
different laptops and they make a giant 

2542
01:55:07,761 --> 01:55:09,320
one too.
That's like a 17 inch one.

2543
01:55:09,321 --> 01:55:12,230
They still make a 17 inch one.
That's a crazy burke.

2544
01:55:12,590 --> 01:55:14,750
This is a for me,
like when I switched,

2545
01:55:14,751 --> 01:55:15,584
people keep asking me because like most 
people just use apple stuff and they 

2546
01:55:17,961 --> 01:55:18,980
stay on apple stuff.

2547
01:55:19,430 --> 01:55:21,800
The hardest thing was trying to use an 
android phone.

2548
01:55:21,830 --> 01:55:23,950
I abandoned that.
The reason why I abandoned that,

2549
01:55:23,951 --> 01:55:27,890
it's just too many fucking people send 
me messages and it's,

2550
01:55:27,891 --> 01:55:28,724
there's no real,
and I contacted a lot like a contact of 

2551
01:55:31,611 --> 01:55:33,530
you and a lot of people.
I called them up and I said,

2552
01:55:33,531 --> 01:55:35,120
hey man,
do me a favor.

2553
01:55:35,450 --> 01:55:38,330
Change the thing on your phone that says
I have an iphone,

2554
01:55:38,331 --> 01:55:41,090
change it to just mobile and tried to 
send me a text message.

2555
01:55:41,120 --> 01:55:42,740
I'm going to send you a text message to 
tell me if you get it.

2556
01:55:42,930 --> 01:55:43,980
And nobody was getting,
they

2557
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:45,660
were getting my messages but nobody's 
messages.

2558
01:55:45,661 --> 01:55:47,930
We're getting back to me,
they were going Osi messages.

2559
01:55:48,740 --> 01:55:51,750
Hold on a second.
It does go both ways but I never got the

2560
01:55:51,751 --> 01:55:52,584
messages back.
But I even contacted apple and I said 

2561
01:55:54,571 --> 01:55:55,404
pull my email off the I message server.
The email that I used to have connected 

2562
01:55:59,911 --> 01:56:03,840
to it and they pulled it and I see it 
still wasn't going through.

2563
01:56:04,770 --> 01:56:08,060
So I waited a day and then after a day I
was thinking,

2564
01:56:08,160 --> 01:56:10,470
I was saying like 50% of the texts I was
sending,

2565
01:56:10,500 --> 01:56:14,550
we're going through his tax and people 
replying as techs 50% the rest of it was

2566
01:56:14,551 --> 01:56:16,710
like a big struggle side.
Okay fuck this.

2567
01:56:17,070 --> 01:56:20,340
Like they make it really hard.
All the Greens that I know,

2568
01:56:20,430 --> 01:56:23,390
like a constantly we're having problems 
like why didn't you text me back and go,

2569
01:56:23,391 --> 01:56:24,300
what are you talking about?

2570
01:56:24,300 --> 01:56:25,133
And then I look at their phone and they 
sent me something or I sent in 

2571
01:56:27,181 --> 01:56:28,014
something.
But the communication between android 

2572
01:56:29,611 --> 01:56:32,700
and apple operating systems is not,
they're still like,

2573
01:56:32,701 --> 01:56:35,730
it's not 100% because I've never 
experienced that.

2574
01:56:35,790 --> 01:56:36,623
I've never experienced anybody sending 
me a green message and I mean not 

2575
01:56:38,971 --> 01:56:41,280
getting it,
but fucking for sure.

2576
01:56:41,340 --> 01:56:42,173
Once I switched over to Android,
it was a disaster for a solid day and a 

2577
01:56:45,571 --> 01:56:46,404
half.
I was,

2578
01:56:46,550 --> 01:56:48,570
and I was in the middle of doing 
business stuff.

2579
01:56:49,020 --> 01:56:50,040
I was like,
I can't do this.

2580
01:56:50,090 --> 01:56:52,470
I need to,
I need to be able to answer questions.

2581
01:56:52,471 --> 01:56:54,000
I need to be able to,
you know?

2582
01:56:54,510 --> 01:56:57,810
So when you try to switch over to 
windows,

2583
01:56:57,811 --> 01:56:59,700
it's easy.
Windows is easy.

2584
01:56:59,910 --> 01:57:01,980
There's windows 10 is great.
It works good.

2585
01:57:01,981 --> 01:57:03,010
I like,
there's a certain,

2586
01:57:03,020 --> 01:57:04,260
a bunch of things.
It's different.

2587
01:57:04,261 --> 01:57:06,930
Weird shows me different pictures on my 
desktop.

2588
01:57:06,930 --> 01:57:07,763
If I decide to every day it shows me 
like new cities and new nature settings 

2589
01:57:10,591 --> 01:57:12,690
and stuff,
I can open it with my fingerprint.

2590
01:57:13,010 --> 01:57:14,050
You know,
there's a lot of like,

2591
01:57:14,110 --> 01:57:15,600
like the password works with my 
fingerprint,

2592
01:57:15,601 --> 01:57:16,800
the keyboards.
Amazing.

2593
01:57:16,890 --> 01:57:21,030
It's a way more comfortable experience 
typing because I was,

2594
01:57:21,090 --> 01:57:23,790
I used Mac books for so fucking long and
they are,

2595
01:57:23,791 --> 01:57:24,624
they're still great,
but Mac books are metal and metal 

2596
01:57:26,761 --> 01:57:29,510
doesn't feel as good in your hands.
Like this plastic,

2597
01:57:29,790 --> 01:57:31,200
I haven't kicked me sir.
Ah,

2598
01:57:31,380 --> 01:57:32,101
Nice.
You're like,

2599
01:57:32,101 --> 01:57:34,110
look at this man.
When you want to start this bitch up,

2600
01:57:34,140 --> 01:57:37,720
you put your fingerprint in there.
The new Mac books have the thumbprint,

2601
01:57:37,740 --> 01:57:39,180
but they,
they're the new keyboards.

2602
01:57:39,210 --> 01:57:39,871
Awful.
I,

2603
01:57:39,871 --> 01:57:42,600
it's like it's,
it doesn't click anymore.

2604
01:57:42,840 --> 01:57:43,950
It's like,
yeah,

2605
01:57:43,980 --> 01:57:44,813
it's like spongy or that's the thing I 
liked the most about this is that the 

2606
01:57:48,781 --> 01:57:50,150
keyboard,
like when you hear,

2607
01:57:50,160 --> 01:57:51,010
when you timelessness.

2608
01:57:51,840 --> 01:57:54,210
Yeah,
it's like a,

2609
01:57:54,420 --> 01:57:58,560
it's like you have like some travel,
you have traveled to the keys,

2610
01:57:58,770 --> 01:58:01,050
you know,
and I think for someone who writes,

2611
01:58:01,080 --> 01:58:01,913
like from me,
my fingers have to be comfortable so I 

2612
01:58:05,581 --> 01:58:07,650
can just,
I know where the letters are.

2613
01:58:07,900 --> 01:58:09,030
They've got to be comfortable.
So like,

2614
01:58:09,031 --> 01:58:09,521
Oh yeah,
this is,

2615
01:58:09,521 --> 01:58:11,670
I get this and when I don't get any 
feedback,

2616
01:58:11,880 --> 01:58:15,540
it's not the same loop of information.
So it doesn't feel as good.

2617
01:58:15,541 --> 01:58:18,390
Like if I tried to type something on 
those virtual keyboards,

2618
01:58:18,391 --> 01:58:20,460
I've tried to type things.
It just feels so weird.

2619
01:58:20,461 --> 01:58:21,294
I never know where am I putting my 
fingers in the right place in the wrong 

2620
01:58:23,491 --> 01:58:24,324
place.
It's just not as good as what apple 

2621
01:58:25,741 --> 01:58:27,930
changed their keyboard too.
That's why it feels a little different.

2622
01:58:27,931 --> 01:58:30,510
They called butterfly.
I like it or some shit.

2623
01:58:31,080 --> 01:58:32,670
And what's the difference?
I don't know.

2624
01:58:32,671 --> 01:58:36,510
It's just a little softer.
This is the old style scissor mechanism.

2625
01:58:36,600 --> 01:58:38,430
So the old style,
you feel more of a click?

2626
01:58:38,460 --> 01:58:39,750
Yeah.
See I want more.

2627
01:58:39,751 --> 01:58:42,580
Click me to this new one.
Felt mushy.

2628
01:58:42,640 --> 01:58:44,200
That's what it felt like.
It mushy.

2629
01:58:44,470 --> 01:58:45,303
Yeah.
I want to click like what I like about 

2630
01:58:47,801 --> 01:58:49,480
this,
like feel this tap,

2631
01:58:49,600 --> 01:58:50,560
tap those keys.
Yeah.

2632
01:58:50,920 --> 01:58:51,940
Oh yeah.
That's perfect.

2633
01:58:51,970 --> 01:58:52,803
Yeah.
And it's like shaped like a little half 

2634
01:58:54,850 --> 01:58:55,240
moon.
Yeah.

2635
01:58:55,240 --> 01:58:57,130
You know like the bottom of it has,
it's,

2636
01:58:57,170 --> 01:58:58,003
it's got like a little dividend.
Your fingers sit in there and you know 

2637
01:59:00,791 --> 01:59:03,670
when you start moving your keys,
like the apple ones are really flat.

2638
01:59:04,120 --> 01:59:04,953
Flat on it.
Yeah.

2639
01:59:04,960 --> 01:59:07,000
That's one of the things that I don't 
like that much.

2640
01:59:07,270 --> 01:59:08,103
What I like about this Lenovo,
this thinkpad is that there's like a 

2641
01:59:10,991 --> 01:59:12,920
contour,
like a uh,

2642
01:59:13,500 --> 01:59:17,170
a pool in the middle of these keys.
Like there's,

2643
01:59:17,200 --> 01:59:18,033
there are lower in the middle and higher
the ends and your fingers float right 

2644
01:59:20,981 --> 01:59:24,130
into that spot and they feel like it's 
giving you feedback.

2645
01:59:24,330 --> 01:59:25,163
She was like,
you can even tell by this photo that 

2646
01:59:26,051 --> 01:59:27,130
Jamie has a look.

2647
01:59:27,130 --> 01:59:27,963
There's barely any difference between a 
non push button and a push button and 

2648
01:59:30,610 --> 01:59:33,550
the kind of like depth there is,
it's barely anything I need more.

2649
01:59:33,580 --> 01:59:34,310
Me Too.
You know,

2650
01:59:34,310 --> 01:59:35,450
like I need more.
I,

2651
01:59:35,620 --> 01:59:36,453
they're trying too hard to be like slick
looking and futuristic and minimalistic 

2652
01:59:41,381 --> 01:59:45,010
and the experience of using something is
like,

2653
01:59:45,040 --> 01:59:47,080
there's,
this is a big issue with the car world,

2654
01:59:47,081 --> 01:59:47,860
you know?
Yeah.

2655
01:59:47,860 --> 01:59:48,693
Because w with new cars,
cars are becoming more and more numb to 

2656
01:59:52,331 --> 01:59:53,164
the experience of driving like the 
steering's now electric instead of 

2657
01:59:56,261 --> 01:59:59,210
hydraulic.
And you're,

2658
01:59:59,211 --> 02:00:01,110
you're like,
you're power steering feels weirder.

2659
02:00:01,120 --> 02:00:03,100
You don't like,
you don't feel it all,

2660
02:00:03,101 --> 02:00:04,840
it feels very universal.
No matter what you do,

2661
02:00:04,841 --> 02:00:09,700
it's easy to turn the wheel and then the
body doesn't give as much feedback.

2662
02:00:09,701 --> 02:00:13,330
The suspension is more improved because 
it absorbs the ground better so it feels

2663
02:00:13,331 --> 02:00:14,410
kind of like you're floating.

2664
02:00:14,770 --> 02:00:18,160
You don't feel like when the tires are 
going to break as much as you used to in

2665
02:00:18,161 --> 02:00:19,810
the old days,
like in the old days,

2666
02:00:19,811 --> 02:00:23,050
if you had an old car,
like if you had like um,

2667
02:00:23,320 --> 02:00:26,620
like a old nine 11 like that's a perfect
example.

2668
02:00:26,621 --> 02:00:31,420
Like a Porsche nine 11 those cars were 
super light and it didn't have that much

2669
02:00:31,421 --> 02:00:32,890
power.
It's one of the things that people don't

2670
02:00:32,891 --> 02:00:37,891
realize like an old porsche has probably
less power for sure than your truck.

2671
02:00:39,460 --> 02:00:42,300
Like what do you think your truck has?
What kind of truck do you have that that

2672
02:00:42,301 --> 02:00:46,210
Ford Edge,
but it's a four by four v six yeah.

2673
02:00:46,211 --> 02:00:51,160
So your [inaudible] probably has like 
260 horsepower and let me guess,

2674
02:00:51,430 --> 02:00:54,850
pull,
pull up Ford edge horsepower,

2675
02:00:55,840 --> 02:00:59,020
2008 let's take a guess now thinking 
about this.

2676
02:00:59,021 --> 02:01:00,250
This is a truck,
right?

2677
02:01:00,310 --> 02:01:04,090
It's a big ass truck.
It's got a lot of body to it.

2678
02:01:04,870 --> 02:01:06,250
They were go bangle.
I nailed.

2679
02:01:06,251 --> 02:01:07,084
Damn.
Okay.

2680
02:01:07,180 --> 02:01:08,013
Now a porsche nine 11 from like 1973 I 
want to say maybe as 140 or 150 

2681
02:01:17,771 --> 02:01:20,290
horsepower.
Let's find out.

2682
02:01:20,320 --> 02:01:24,790
Sutton nine 11 porsche nine 11 1973 
horsepower.

2683
02:01:25,330 --> 02:01:26,950
Not popping right up or would it be the 
best place?

2684
02:01:27,180 --> 02:01:28,013
Just Google horsepower portion?
Not In 1973 Porsche nine 11 stock 

2685
02:01:32,100 --> 02:01:37,100
horsepower should have it on Wiki said 
it increased from 190 to something.

2686
02:01:37,961 --> 02:01:40,310
Does that sound right?
Maybe it was a turbo.

2687
02:01:40,940 --> 02:01:42,950
Do they have a turbine 73 I don't think 
they did.

2688
02:01:43,270 --> 02:01:44,450
Probably not.
Anyway,

2689
02:01:45,190 --> 02:01:46,040
uh,
your,

2690
02:01:47,510 --> 02:01:48,430
what do we got?
Sorry,

2691
02:01:48,431 --> 02:01:50,770
you said nine 11 yeah,
yeah.

2692
02:01:50,771 --> 02:01:51,520
No,
and that's the word.

2693
02:01:51,520 --> 02:01:52,930
The right word.
Nine 11 career.

2694
02:01:54,070 --> 02:01:59,070
Career means race in some fucking,
what does that,

2695
02:01:59,231 --> 02:02:03,070
you think German doesn't seem like 
Carrera sounds like in a time where it's

2696
02:02:03,071 --> 02:02:04,820
got Italian.
What's that Jim?

2697
02:02:05,130 --> 02:02:05,963
Uh,
I see 200 developing a 210 ps or two 10 

2698
02:02:10,030 --> 02:02:11,620
to land.
210.

2699
02:02:11,680 --> 02:02:13,450
Okay.
So if that's what it is,

2700
02:02:13,510 --> 02:02:17,620
your,
your truck has 50 more horsepower than a

2701
02:02:17,621 --> 02:02:18,454
porsche,
which is like a super sports car and at 

2702
02:02:21,101 --> 02:02:23,020
the time,
but um,

2703
02:02:23,080 --> 02:02:26,800
that car is so light that you feel 
everything like with those,

2704
02:02:26,801 --> 02:02:27,634
those old Porsche's,
like you feel every bump in the road 

2705
02:02:30,550 --> 02:02:31,383
when the tires start to give out,
you kind of feel him given out like you 

2706
02:02:33,701 --> 02:02:35,560
feel in your butt,
like you know,

2707
02:02:35,561 --> 02:02:37,780
when it's happening.
Whereas with,

2708
02:02:37,781 --> 02:02:39,310
um,
uh,

2709
02:02:39,460 --> 02:02:40,480
modern cars,
man,

2710
02:02:40,490 --> 02:02:41,560
they,
they go numb.

2711
02:02:41,560 --> 02:02:42,393
You don't feel them anymore.
That's the same thing with like 

2712
02:02:43,841 --> 02:02:46,720
electronic stuff.
Like I have a mechanical keyboard on my,

2713
02:02:46,870 --> 02:02:49,870
on my home computer.
It's like a real clickety click,

2714
02:02:49,871 --> 02:02:50,530
click,
click.

2715
02:02:50,530 --> 02:02:52,930
It feels,
is your home computer pc or Mac?

2716
02:02:52,931 --> 02:02:55,120
It's a PC.
It's a macro.

2717
02:02:55,230 --> 02:02:56,063
Okay.
Mac.

2718
02:02:56,340 --> 02:02:57,190
Um,
but uh,

2719
02:02:57,220 --> 02:02:59,770
but I would use a pc for home computer.
I have no problem.

2720
02:02:59,771 --> 02:03:00,820
I don't do anything,
man.

2721
02:03:00,910 --> 02:03:02,290
What do I do?
I write,

2722
02:03:02,680 --> 02:03:03,690
I write on this,
they,

2723
02:03:03,700 --> 02:03:06,040
and then also there's a program,
one of the big issues,

2724
02:03:06,060 --> 02:03:09,460
like I've talked about that right room 
program that I use all the time.

2725
02:03:09,880 --> 02:03:14,050
There's one that they make this even 
better for a windows,

2726
02:03:14,080 --> 02:03:16,750
it's called the focus.
It's called focus.

2727
02:03:16,751 --> 02:03:18,070
Right?
Or something like that.

2728
02:03:18,700 --> 02:03:19,533
Let's see,
what is it called?

2729
02:03:19,950 --> 02:03:23,170
Career is race and Spanish.
Ah,

2730
02:03:23,200 --> 02:03:24,820
there we go.
It was named after a race.

2731
02:03:26,290 --> 02:03:27,123
The car was,

2732
02:03:27,900 --> 02:03:31,560
I've been looking at pcs just because I 
want to get the one of the,

2733
02:03:31,620 --> 02:03:34,390
either the Oculus or the HTC vibe.
Yeah.

2734
02:03:34,680 --> 02:03:36,960
Focus writers.
The name of this program that I use,

2735
02:03:36,961 --> 02:03:38,290
but it's the same thing as the right 
room,

2736
02:03:38,291 --> 02:03:41,500
which just gives you that uh,
oh yeah.

2737
02:03:41,580 --> 02:03:44,070
Green Font with a black background.
It's like dos.

2738
02:03:44,310 --> 02:03:47,040
That to me is like the most important 
thing about writing.

2739
02:03:47,280 --> 02:03:49,260
If I can get a program like that on my 
computer,

2740
02:03:49,500 --> 02:03:51,480
what else does it need to do?
As long as it doesn't fuck me,

2741
02:03:51,650 --> 02:03:52,483
it doesn't let just crash all the time.
And thinking about these think pants is 

2742
02:03:54,990 --> 02:03:55,823
they use these,
these are military spec and they use 

2743
02:03:58,021 --> 02:04:01,260
these in a lot of like big businesses.
They don't want these things to fuck up.

2744
02:04:01,440 --> 02:04:02,490
So these are,
these are like a,

2745
02:04:02,491 --> 02:04:05,910
it's a very durable computer.
It's so durable that a lot like a lot of

2746
02:04:05,911 --> 02:04:06,501
these people,
they don't,

2747
02:04:06,501 --> 02:04:07,334
they don't even recommend wicked windows
10 they want windows seven it's like 

2748
02:04:10,590 --> 02:04:11,423
they sell it with windows seven as an 
option and I've seen windows seven it's 

2749
02:04:14,011 --> 02:04:15,720
like Jesus Christ.
What do you mean the nineties here?

2750
02:04:15,770 --> 02:04:17,370
Windows xp pro.
Yeah.

2751
02:04:17,371 --> 02:04:19,500
They go back because it's like super 
stable.

2752
02:04:19,501 --> 02:04:22,890
Like it's been worked out and yeah,
you don't need Mac anymore.

2753
02:04:23,880 --> 02:04:24,713
It's nice that they innovate and they 
keep coming up with cool shit and their 

2754
02:04:27,301 --> 02:04:31,890
phones are still awesome.
But the experience on a windows computer

2755
02:04:31,920 --> 02:04:36,050
is in Miami is snuck not much different.
It took me like how long Jamie?

2756
02:04:36,080 --> 02:04:37,770
A couple of days I was,
this thing's great.

2757
02:04:38,280 --> 02:04:38,821
It's,
I'm not,

2758
02:04:38,821 --> 02:04:40,410
I don't have a problem with it at all.
I don't miss it at all.

2759
02:04:40,470 --> 02:04:42,860
Is that a gaming at all?
You can is,

2760
02:04:42,870 --> 02:04:45,540
this is not the best one for gaming.
This is a work computer,

2761
02:04:45,630 --> 02:04:50,220
but the battery life is fucking insane.
It looks like it has a great dad.

2762
02:04:50,270 --> 02:04:51,930
Actually,
it looks like the laptop.

2763
02:04:51,931 --> 02:04:52,764
I sewed you when I lived in Ohio that I 
went to the airport and I got fucking 

2764
02:04:57,150 --> 02:05:00,130
flag for it.
There's a smaller one,

2765
02:05:00,460 --> 02:05:04,470
a thinkpad p x to 60 or something like 
that.

2766
02:05:04,830 --> 02:05:07,830
I think that's it,
but it gets 17 fucking hours.

2767
02:05:07,920 --> 02:05:11,760
17 hours of use online with no,
with not being plugged in.

2768
02:05:11,970 --> 02:05:12,803
Yeah.
I'm looking at a alienware and Razer as 

2769
02:05:14,741 --> 02:05:19,741
the two is the new one that they just,
this thing that qh deep razor laptops or

2770
02:05:21,271 --> 02:05:24,480
like there were like super high end 
laptops.

2771
02:05:24,510 --> 02:05:26,060
There's a beautiful,
yeah,

2772
02:05:26,100 --> 02:05:27,640
they're all aluminum.
Well,

2773
02:05:27,670 --> 02:05:29,130
you know like the,
it looks a lot,

2774
02:05:29,190 --> 02:05:33,660
a lot like a Mac book and a lot of ways.
It's like a aluminum pc version of a Mac

2775
02:05:33,661 --> 02:05:34,494
bar.
Yeah.

2776
02:05:35,100 --> 02:05:36,870
Jamie,
you have an htc.

2777
02:05:36,900 --> 02:05:37,733
Do you use,

2778
02:05:37,960 --> 02:05:39,690
do you use a laptop?
I got to go.

2779
02:05:40,240 --> 02:05:41,920
I want it to be a little more stable.
Uh,

2780
02:05:41,921 --> 02:05:44,290
I didn't get the best,
highest end thing you could get.

2781
02:05:44,560 --> 02:05:47,140
Did you just go to like best buy and 
just grab a computer?

2782
02:05:47,200 --> 02:05:50,130
I went to fry's,
I found something that was,

2783
02:05:50,490 --> 02:05:52,090
I could've got it at best buy but they 
didn't.

2784
02:05:52,450 --> 02:05:56,080
The actual computer I found I wanted to 
get wasn't available at the store at the

2785
02:05:56,081 --> 02:05:58,060
time.
It was back ordered on different places.

2786
02:05:58,061 --> 02:06:00,100
I've found it somewhere in California.
I could go get one.

2787
02:06:00,620 --> 02:06:01,453
I got at my hands that day cause I had 
ordered a five and I didn't want it 

2788
02:06:03,161 --> 02:06:05,800
sitting around staring at me and I 
couldn't use it.

2789
02:06:05,801 --> 02:06:07,180
So I went and got something I can play 
with.

2790
02:06:07,270 --> 02:06:10,500
I do almost nothing on this computer 
other than web surf and right,

2791
02:06:10,740 --> 02:06:11,573
right.
Yeah.

2792
02:06:11,680 --> 02:06:13,030
That's it.
It does everything.

2793
02:06:13,060 --> 02:06:16,270
And this thing also has to fucking 
terabytes.

2794
02:06:16,480 --> 02:06:18,970
Two terabytes of storage in it.
Yeah.

2795
02:06:19,720 --> 02:06:20,291
And I,
you know,

2796
02:06:20,291 --> 02:06:23,050
when the,
the new Max in have a USB port,

2797
02:06:23,051 --> 02:06:25,030
I was like fuck you.
But did it.

2798
02:06:25,031 --> 02:06:25,864
The new computers did these new laughter
pc when still have this one does this 

2799
02:06:29,531 --> 02:06:31,410
has everything.
This has htmi.

2800
02:06:31,900 --> 02:06:34,780
This thing has everything.
It has a smart card reader.

2801
02:06:35,230 --> 02:06:40,230
It's like they just keep making things 
less and less convenient and no options.

2802
02:06:40,390 --> 02:06:43,570
Like how about you have one of those and
then you have one.

2803
02:06:44,020 --> 02:06:46,390
Let's go crazy with some fucking USB 
ports.

2804
02:06:46,630 --> 02:06:48,910
How about you have one that has a 
disposable battery?

2805
02:06:49,150 --> 02:06:50,800
Let us know.
Like cute.

2806
02:06:50,890 --> 02:06:52,780
Can you make one with a replaceable 
battery?

2807
02:06:52,870 --> 02:06:55,510
Isn't that possible?
It fucks keyboard on the razor.

2808
02:06:55,770 --> 02:06:56,650
That's that's,
yeah,

2809
02:06:56,651 --> 02:06:58,370
that's green.
Look at that.

2810
02:06:58,520 --> 02:06:59,950
Had,
oh my God.

2811
02:06:59,980 --> 02:07:02,730
What a special hotkeys set up to 
whatever you want them to be.

2812
02:07:02,810 --> 02:07:07,180
Some hot keys can be a male.
Some hot keys could be youtube.

2813
02:07:07,181 --> 02:07:09,250
Wow,
that's dope.

2814
02:07:09,400 --> 02:07:12,040
I didn't know.
Blast off and it's super thin.

2815
02:07:12,390 --> 02:07:14,200
Know how much do they,
um,

2816
02:07:14,230 --> 02:07:17,470
yeah,
I'm just exactly echo this stealth.

2817
02:07:17,500 --> 02:07:18,950
I'm not sure if this is actually this 
stealth,

2818
02:07:18,951 --> 02:07:21,220
this with this keyboard.
It might be a little more specked out,

2819
02:07:21,221 --> 02:07:24,220
but the tell starts like 1400 bucks,
which isn't very bad at all.

2820
02:07:24,221 --> 02:07:26,500
Especially if you went over on the 
baddest ass games,

2821
02:07:26,501 --> 02:07:27,334
you can and it can run really bad ass 
games and stuff on ultra settings with 

2822
02:07:30,731 --> 02:07:33,160
these,
which is fantastic.

2823
02:07:33,250 --> 02:07:36,070
So that's the way more physical 
capability than

2824
02:07:36,070 --> 02:07:39,760
a Mac keyboard or a Mac laptop would 
rather right now.

2825
02:07:39,761 --> 02:07:41,110
Um,
how big did they make them?

2826
02:07:41,111 --> 02:07:42,430
Cause that's another thing that annoyed 
me.

2827
02:07:42,640 --> 02:07:44,700
So when apple stopped doing the 17 inch 
one,

2828
02:07:44,800 --> 02:07:49,800
I know they make a 17 mm hmm.
Well what APP would apple's done?

2829
02:07:52,370 --> 02:07:52,921
Let's see.
All,

2830
02:07:52,921 --> 02:07:54,200
see if they make a 17 inch one.
Yeah,

2831
02:07:55,270 --> 02:07:56,850
they do.
Oh my God.

2832
02:07:56,870 --> 02:07:58,330
17 inches.
So at the size of that thing,

2833
02:08:00,040 --> 02:08:00,873
let me see a big picture.
Look at that fucking science and that 

2834
02:08:02,711 --> 02:08:04,360
thing.
Look at the blade pro.

2835
02:08:04,720 --> 02:08:07,330
The blade pros looks better.
But again,

2836
02:08:07,390 --> 02:08:07,991
here,
look,

2837
02:08:07,991 --> 02:08:10,900
I'm sure those are bad ass and they're 
probably better than this for,

2838
02:08:10,901 --> 02:08:11,734
I'm running games on it.
And if I wanted to run games I'd be all 

2839
02:08:14,771 --> 02:08:15,604
over that shit.
But you don't want to get virtual 

2840
02:08:17,260 --> 02:08:18,093
reality too busy.
That playstation virtual reality really 

2841
02:08:22,301 --> 02:08:24,160
got me.
I have a pool table game.

2842
02:08:24,270 --> 02:08:26,470
You can play pool.
And I have a pool table right out there.

2843
02:08:27,450 --> 02:08:28,283
Come on,
let's play.

2844
02:08:28,810 --> 02:08:30,160
But it's uh,
it's,

2845
02:08:30,190 --> 02:08:32,300
it's got me addicted.
Like I'm addicted to it now,

2846
02:08:32,710 --> 02:08:36,700
but I really want to play like the HTC,
I don't know which one to get though.

2847
02:08:36,790 --> 02:08:39,400
Do the vive that Dunkin has,
it's fucking insane.

2848
02:08:39,640 --> 02:08:42,100
And there's a boxing game that you play 
on it.

2849
02:08:42,101 --> 02:08:44,710
Yeah.
It's kind of weird because you too,

2850
02:08:44,770 --> 02:08:46,900
for the knuckles to come out like this,
like they would,

2851
02:08:46,901 --> 02:08:47,734
if you're punching somebody,
you have to hold your hand upright so 

2852
02:08:50,231 --> 02:08:53,860
that the bottom of your hand is facing 
the ground and your thumb is facing up.

2853
02:08:54,040 --> 02:08:56,410
So that's the only way you get the 
gloves to look right.

2854
02:08:56,770 --> 02:08:59,590
So it feels weird because you're 
punching them like this Kinda,

2855
02:08:59,640 --> 02:09:00,473
yeah.
Like you're not turning your knuckles 

2856
02:09:01,271 --> 02:09:02,920
over,
but that's just in your head.

2857
02:09:03,070 --> 02:09:03,903
Like if you,
if you could get over the fact that the 

2858
02:09:04,901 --> 02:09:05,734
knuckles look different on screen,
you can just turn your hands in and 

2859
02:09:08,381 --> 02:09:11,350
punch like you normally would,
but you get a workout doing it,

2860
02:09:11,351 --> 02:09:12,760
man.
It's like a real workout.

2861
02:09:12,880 --> 02:09:14,620
Yeah.
Like you're boxing against the dude.

2862
02:09:14,621 --> 02:09:16,430
You're moving.
And he's throwing punches at you.

2863
02:09:16,431 --> 02:09:17,264
You're just trying to get out of the way
and he hits you like everything lights 

2864
02:09:19,451 --> 02:09:20,231
up,
it gets white.

2865
02:09:20,231 --> 02:09:22,240
Like you just get hit.
Yeah,

2866
02:09:22,420 --> 02:09:23,253
I want to do it

2867
02:09:23,540 --> 02:09:25,730
can get all the,
I'm pretty sure of this too.

2868
02:09:25,740 --> 02:09:27,800
You can get all the oculus games on the 
vive.

2869
02:09:27,890 --> 02:09:29,400
You can,
you can do it the other way around.

2870
02:09:30,370 --> 02:09:34,580
Does a program something,
does it the vibe have more cameras?

2871
02:09:34,581 --> 02:09:36,050
So it has,
oh the larger,

2872
02:09:36,110 --> 02:09:38,240
it uses something called room scale.
So there's two,

2873
02:09:38,270 --> 02:09:40,760
you can buy more if you want.
I'm not sure really why he would want to

2874
02:09:40,761 --> 02:09:43,140
buy more yet.
But it comes with two uh,

2875
02:09:43,460 --> 02:09:44,690
lighthouses,
what they're called.

2876
02:09:44,691 --> 02:09:45,524
You play six and a half feet off the 
ground and they figure out like where 

2877
02:09:49,101 --> 02:09:50,900
you are and track,
you track the headset,

2878
02:09:50,901 --> 02:09:53,110
check your hands in the room.
So they always kind of know what's right

2879
02:09:53,111 --> 02:09:53,751
low,
what's left.

2880
02:09:53,751 --> 02:09:55,690
You don't have to keep switching your 
hands around.

2881
02:09:55,950 --> 02:09:56,783
Wow.
There's another game that Duncan had 

2882
02:09:57,931 --> 02:10:00,390
that's an archery game that's fucking 
amazing.

2883
02:10:00,910 --> 02:10:02,850
It is.
When you draw back and they're,

2884
02:10:02,851 --> 02:10:04,580
they're raiding the castle and like,
yeah,

2885
02:10:04,620 --> 02:10:05,910
they're coming out and you need to shoot
at him.

2886
02:10:06,080 --> 02:10:09,320
They're like circles with like shields 
in front of them and spears on go.

2887
02:10:09,321 --> 02:10:10,154
Do you think,
would you say you did that with Dunkin 

2888
02:10:12,540 --> 02:10:13,321
timber?
Maybe?

2889
02:10:13,321 --> 02:10:14,730
Yeah,
probably around then.

2890
02:10:14,790 --> 02:10:17,310
Just in that amount of time from now til
then.

2891
02:10:17,640 --> 02:10:21,300
There's three cooler archery games that 
have come out.

2892
02:10:21,720 --> 02:10:22,553
There's like a hunting experience game 
where you're like walking around the 

2893
02:10:24,301 --> 02:10:24,850
woods.

2894
02:10:24,850 --> 02:10:25,683
You know what I would really like?
I would really like if they made one 

2895
02:10:29,051 --> 02:10:31,900
where I can use my real bow.
Oh that'd be cool.

2896
02:10:32,070 --> 02:10:34,730
Cause if I could use my real bow and I 
could draw it back,

2897
02:10:34,790 --> 02:10:36,470
it would have to be in some sort of a 
secured room.

2898
02:10:36,500 --> 02:10:38,880
You take off the headset and there's a 
bunch of dead people everywhere.

2899
02:10:40,100 --> 02:10:40,933
But um,
but it would actually help you because 

2900
02:10:42,991 --> 02:10:44,660
of the weight,
the weight of the bow.

2901
02:10:44,690 --> 02:10:48,350
You want to feel the exact weight.
The biggest issue right now with that is

2902
02:10:48,351 --> 02:10:50,480
that that headset gets in the way of 
when you're trying,

2903
02:10:50,481 --> 02:10:52,840
like you draw the ball,
you put next to your head that yeah,

2904
02:10:53,010 --> 02:10:55,430
it would hit your thing because as I'm 
doing it now,

2905
02:10:55,431 --> 02:10:58,130
I'm just pulling it back like this on 
Dunkin's,

2906
02:10:58,310 --> 02:11:00,950
but I know there's a video game.
Let's look this up.

2907
02:11:01,190 --> 02:11:02,660
Maybe this will be a new thing for the 
the,

2908
02:11:02,690 --> 02:11:03,523
the new studio.
There's an archery game where you 

2909
02:11:05,931 --> 02:11:06,764
actually shoot at a screen and animals 
walk in front and you shoot a real bow 

2910
02:11:11,360 --> 02:11:16,360
at the screen and where it hits,
it lights up like yes you are.

2911
02:11:16,940 --> 02:11:17,773
Oh cool.
You're shooting a real fucking Arrow at 

2912
02:11:19,971 --> 02:11:22,190
a real screen down with that.
Yeah,

2913
02:11:22,410 --> 02:11:25,400
like we'll get this real tree whitetail 
country.

2914
02:11:25,820 --> 02:11:27,320
I don't know if this is it.
Okay.

2915
02:11:27,321 --> 02:11:28,154
This is it.
Yeah.

2916
02:11:28,640 --> 02:11:29,870
Techno Hunt.
Okay,

2917
02:11:30,050 --> 02:11:35,050
so watch this guys got a video and he's 
standing in front of the screen.

2918
02:11:37,820 --> 02:11:38,690
He's going to shoot it.
Okay.

2919
02:11:38,700 --> 02:11:39,441
Can we say,
Oh yeah,

2920
02:11:39,441 --> 02:11:40,274
look at this.
So it looks like it's about 40 yards 

2921
02:11:41,811 --> 02:11:43,370
away.
Not even,

2922
02:11:43,610 --> 02:11:45,720
I should say 40 feet away.
Watch.

2923
02:11:45,740 --> 02:11:48,970
This is going to shoot at it.
Perfect shot right there.

2924
02:11:50,140 --> 02:11:50,973
That's stupid.
You would shoot through your screen 

2925
02:11:53,720 --> 02:11:54,470
immediately.

2926
02:11:54,470 --> 02:11:55,880
No,
but that's what he just did.

2927
02:11:56,360 --> 02:11:58,670
He that that stuck into the screen now.
That was a,

2928
02:11:58,671 --> 02:12:00,320
that was a picture of an era.
So what is it?

2929
02:12:00,321 --> 02:12:02,540
A fake error right away you see the 
Arrow bounce off?

2930
02:12:02,541 --> 02:12:03,374
Wait a minute,
let me say it.

2931
02:12:03,620 --> 02:12:04,790
Let me just do it again.
Do it again.

2932
02:12:04,940 --> 02:12:06,650
It's just like from 1982 I think.
No,

2933
02:12:06,651 --> 02:12:07,460
no,
no.

2934
02:12:07,460 --> 02:12:08,293
Hold on.
So he hit it and it shows where you hit 

2935
02:12:12,170 --> 02:12:14,960
a big fake arrow.
That's a fake cow.

2936
02:12:14,961 --> 02:12:18,470
But he actually did hit it where the 
fake Arrow points to pick out.

2937
02:12:18,510 --> 02:12:21,650
Just indicating what spot on the screen 
and he's out hit the wall to,

2938
02:12:21,840 --> 02:12:22,550
yeah,
listen,

2939
02:12:22,550 --> 02:12:24,860
I hear it again.
We'll just slip one in there.

2940
02:12:25,420 --> 02:12:27,320
But you're,
you're super powerful.

2941
02:12:27,350 --> 02:12:29,630
Bo would shoot some shit through a wall.
Right?

2942
02:12:29,631 --> 02:12:30,464
You would want to use a less powerful,
I think you actually have to like Cam 

2943
02:12:33,110 --> 02:12:35,570
Haynes was playing this game and he told
me they had a de tune,

2944
02:12:35,571 --> 02:12:40,190
his bow and a,
I think at the time he was shooting with

2945
02:12:40,191 --> 02:12:41,660
a 70 pound bow.

2946
02:12:42,110 --> 02:12:45,170
I think he was shooting with a carbon 
spider turbo,

2947
02:12:45,171 --> 02:12:47,450
but I might be wrong.
But at the carbon spider turbo,

2948
02:12:47,451 --> 02:12:49,880
they don't,
they didn't make that any faster than 70

2949
02:12:49,881 --> 02:12:53,900
pounds or any more weight.
I think it's probably a feet per second.

2950
02:12:54,110 --> 02:12:55,790
And um,
kinetic energy thing,

2951
02:12:55,791 --> 02:12:58,130
like the hour we'll probably has to be a
certain weight too,

2952
02:12:58,310 --> 02:12:59,143
but it would just be more fun.
Or what'd you actually getting benefit 

2953
02:13:01,221 --> 02:13:04,820
out of practicing with something that's 
less powerful than what you usually use?

2954
02:13:05,240 --> 02:13:06,073
Um,
there's a different feel to a less 

2955
02:13:07,401 --> 02:13:08,234
powerful bow,
but the principles of archery or the 

2956
02:13:10,161 --> 02:13:13,940
same as long as you hold right,
pulled through the shot,

2957
02:13:14,330 --> 02:13:18,140
anchor in the same way.
Use the correct body positioning.

2958
02:13:18,370 --> 02:13:19,850
I'm going to do archery.
Dude.

2959
02:13:20,020 --> 02:13:22,130
Archery is awesome.
I love doing it.

2960
02:13:22,280 --> 02:13:24,350
It's so fun.
And,

2961
02:13:24,351 --> 02:13:26,660
uh,
if it wasn't for my friend Cameron Hanes

2962
02:13:26,661 --> 02:13:29,450
and my friend John Dudley,
I wouldn't know shit about it.

2963
02:13:30,140 --> 02:13:31,890
It takes a long time to learn.
Okay.

2964
02:13:31,891 --> 02:13:34,890
This is a different one.
So this guy is doing it here.

2965
02:13:34,891 --> 02:13:35,910
Boom.
Oh,

2966
02:13:36,480 --> 02:13:38,970
that's better.
Let me see that again.

2967
02:13:39,390 --> 02:13:40,223
Backed that up again.
So he shoots and where does his Arrow 

2968
02:13:42,841 --> 02:13:44,550
go?
So it does bounce off the wall.

2969
02:13:44,610 --> 02:13:47,680
Yeah.
See you have to use a bitch ass bro.

2970
02:13:47,750 --> 02:13:49,800
And I'm just kind of a rubber point at 
the end.

2971
02:13:50,250 --> 02:13:52,250
They can make better wine.
Yeah.

2972
02:13:52,260 --> 02:13:54,690
Well it's good practice for sure.
This is,

2973
02:13:54,691 --> 02:13:56,730
see like he's hitting perfect every 
time.

2974
02:13:57,030 --> 02:13:59,910
So it's good practice for that,
for aiming the vitals and all that.

2975
02:13:59,940 --> 02:14:01,650
Exactly,
exactly.

2976
02:14:01,680 --> 02:14:03,810
But it can't be more than,
this is like 20,

2977
02:14:03,811 --> 02:14:06,270
um,
20 yards away.

2978
02:14:06,271 --> 02:14:08,400
It looks like big bucks on game.
There's,

2979
02:14:08,401 --> 02:14:10,050
you're not,
you're not getting any hunting value out

2980
02:14:10,051 --> 02:14:11,420
of that.
It's just no shoot,

2981
02:14:11,430 --> 02:14:12,810
fix shit with a fictional,
but this is,

2982
02:14:12,811 --> 02:14:14,310
they're shooting a real bow.

2983
02:14:14,430 --> 02:14:15,263
So to answer your question,
the difference between shooting like a 

2984
02:14:17,731 --> 02:14:18,564
50 pound bow with these light arrows,
it bounced off the screaming like what 

2985
02:14:21,691 --> 02:14:23,790
benefit you would get.
You'd get a lot of benefit.

2986
02:14:24,300 --> 02:14:29,280
Like you don't need a big heavy bow to a
to get the benefit of being accurate.

2987
02:14:29,281 --> 02:14:30,750
Like people are accurate with like 
really,

2988
02:14:30,751 --> 02:14:34,530
really light bows and that's really all 
you'd worry about as long as you had the

2989
02:14:34,531 --> 02:14:35,364
strength,
how rude they gonna shoot a rabbit as 

2990
02:14:37,141 --> 02:14:38,930
long as you have the strap right in the 
eyeball.

2991
02:14:39,120 --> 02:14:40,460
Bullseye.
Okay,

2992
02:14:40,740 --> 02:14:41,573
stop.
Who is the name of this company that's 

2993
02:14:44,041 --> 02:14:46,350
rude and shot it in the eyeball and it 
says Bullseye.

2994
02:14:46,860 --> 02:14:48,750
I feel like I could design a better 
version of that.

2995
02:14:48,930 --> 02:14:49,763
Well,
it's probably super hard to make 

2996
02:14:50,731 --> 02:14:51,564
something where you can actually shoot 
something on a screen and it registers 

2997
02:14:55,980 --> 02:14:57,930
right,
like find out.

2998
02:14:58,020 --> 02:14:58,853
I bet that's expensive as fuck.
That's probably same technology that 

2999
02:15:00,721 --> 02:15:02,890
does the golf course.
Oh yeah.

3000
02:15:02,910 --> 02:15:03,743
But,
but the difference in the golf thing is 

3001
02:15:04,711 --> 02:15:07,620
a golf is a ball.
You're knocking it into a screen.

3002
02:15:08,040 --> 02:15:10,090
Fastest Shit.
Not as fast as a bow,

3003
02:15:10,320 --> 02:15:13,080
but you could probably have something 
where it's just going in a different way

3004
02:15:13,081 --> 02:15:13,914
though.
There's a point in the end of a bow or 

3005
02:15:15,421 --> 02:15:16,560
an arrow rather.
Yeah,

3006
02:15:17,250 --> 02:15:19,140
I bet.
A golf club,

3007
02:15:19,141 --> 02:15:19,974
when you hit a golf ball,
I bet it does go faster if you really 

3008
02:15:22,831 --> 02:15:25,020
drive it,
does it?

3009
02:15:25,200 --> 02:15:26,033
Okay.
How many feet per second do you think 

3010
02:15:26,671 --> 02:15:29,250
someone drives a golf ball?
Feet per second.

3011
02:15:29,270 --> 02:15:30,090
Yeah.
Oh,

3012
02:15:30,090 --> 02:15:33,390
Jeez.
How many feet per second is tiger woods?

3013
02:15:33,420 --> 02:15:34,201
Knock a golf.
Oh,

3014
02:15:34,201 --> 02:15:34,910
John.
Who?

3015
02:15:34,910 --> 02:15:36,420
Who Hits it harder?
John Daly.

3016
02:15:36,480 --> 02:15:38,070
John Daly hit it harder than tiger 
woods.

3017
02:15:38,300 --> 02:15:40,230
You See Tigers Nipples,
his nipples.

3018
02:15:40,290 --> 02:15:42,150
He did.
You see at Jamie,

3019
02:15:42,780 --> 02:15:43,613
he released a naked or not ne,
a shirtless photo and his nipples had 

3020
02:15:46,441 --> 02:15:49,130
been the talk of the town.
He's got nipple.

3021
02:15:49,180 --> 02:15:53,010
It's time to move to a new town.
You live in the wrong fucking town.

3022
02:15:53,011 --> 02:15:54,400
If all they're talking about is tiger 
woods,

3023
02:15:54,450 --> 02:15:55,283
hey,
hey,

3024
02:15:56,870 --> 02:15:59,760
open up man.
Have you heard about tiger samples?

3025
02:16:00,630 --> 02:16:02,700
What is,
look at what's going on with his goatee?

3026
02:16:02,701 --> 02:16:04,410
Is that real?
It's something somebody said he does for

3027
02:16:04,411 --> 02:16:07,180
his kids.
It's like bad ass answer some shots.

3028
02:16:07,890 --> 02:16:08,723
It's a loophole.
If I was Brendan Schaub I would say for 

3029
02:16:11,251 --> 02:16:14,350
sure don't do that anymore.
Um,

3030
02:16:15,570 --> 02:16:16,403
what is the um,
feet per second of the golf ball 

3031
02:16:18,360 --> 02:16:21,390
hundred.
You had to take me on a nipple detour.

3032
02:16:21,391 --> 02:16:22,224
Huh?
How many feet per second does a golf 

3033
02:16:25,381 --> 02:16:28,020
ball?
50 travel 150.

3034
02:16:28,740 --> 02:16:30,970
How many per second does a golf ball 
travel?

3035
02:16:33,130 --> 02:16:33,963
Let's see.

3036
02:16:34,460 --> 02:16:34,730
Okay.

3037
02:16:34,730 --> 02:16:37,940
You say 5,950
150 probably more than that.

3038
02:16:38,900 --> 02:16:41,180
That's probably about as fast as a bow 
and arrow.

3039
02:16:41,450 --> 02:16:43,030
250 feet per second.
Yeah,

3040
02:16:43,400 --> 02:16:45,890
that's good.
Terminal speed for a,

3041
02:16:45,891 --> 02:16:46,960
an arrow.
Oh,

3042
02:16:47,130 --> 02:16:47,963
like that's what you want.
The rule is that you can't hit a ball 

3043
02:16:49,491 --> 02:16:51,170
faster than that.
And the Oh,

3044
02:16:51,240 --> 02:16:52,520
Sga,
what?

3045
02:16:53,030 --> 02:16:55,010
You can tell someone they can't hit it 
faster.

3046
02:16:55,040 --> 02:16:58,460
Maximum tolerance of 2% will be allowed.
What?

3047
02:16:58,850 --> 02:17:01,160
I don't get like a what if you get some 
dude who's like,

3048
02:17:01,190 --> 02:17:02,540
okay,
how about this?

3049
02:17:02,630 --> 02:17:07,550
What if like coby bryant goes into golf,
like think a super athlete,

3050
02:17:07,760 --> 02:17:10,340
driving a golf ball perfectly.
It's more like,

3051
02:17:10,341 --> 02:17:13,340
so a hundred you can calculate with your
swing and the,

3052
02:17:13,480 --> 02:17:16,910
the weight and the speed of your driver 
clubface and all that.

3053
02:17:17,500 --> 02:17:19,340
Uh,
and then balls way different amounts to,

3054
02:17:19,350 --> 02:17:20,183
it's maybe because there's people 
standing around and you could fuck 

3055
02:17:21,891 --> 02:17:23,960
somebody up.
You're fucking a mock no matter what,

3056
02:17:23,961 --> 02:17:24,794
man,
he hit him 200 miles an hour in the 

3057
02:17:25,611 --> 02:17:26,870
face.
You're fucking a month.

3058
02:17:27,880 --> 02:17:28,820
I don't know.
That's ridiculous.

3059
02:17:29,020 --> 02:17:29,853
[inaudible] 72 is okay,
but imagine if you did have a guy like 

3060
02:17:32,841 --> 02:17:35,930
a,
a Koby Bryant or like our Lebron James.

3061
02:17:35,931 --> 02:17:36,764
It gets an a cough like Leblanc.
Lebron James gets a cough and it can 

3062
02:17:40,460 --> 02:17:42,530
knock a fucking golf ball to the moon.

3063
02:17:44,320 --> 02:17:45,153
But uh,
that's about the same speed an arrow 

3064
02:17:46,211 --> 02:17:48,440
goes.
If it's a good heavy air,

3065
02:17:48,441 --> 02:17:52,630
like a lot of people like to try to keep
their arrows actually under 280 feet per

3066
02:17:52,631 --> 02:17:53,464
second,
like pursue between 280 and some people 

3067
02:17:55,271 --> 02:17:56,104
get up to like two 90 ish,
but they feel like when the arrows go 

3068
02:17:58,931 --> 02:18:00,850
faster than that,
they actually,

3069
02:18:00,851 --> 02:18:04,090
the flight gets compromised.
It's like there's so much.

3070
02:18:04,330 --> 02:18:05,163
Yeah.
Because there's almost like too much 

3071
02:18:06,521 --> 02:18:08,740
wind resistance.
There's too much a,

3072
02:18:08,741 --> 02:18:12,880
there's like the wind impacts the way 
the thing spins.

3073
02:18:13,030 --> 02:18:13,863
What does this long drives?
That's guy hitting about 200 mile an 

3074
02:18:16,691 --> 02:18:17,680
hour ball.
Okay,

3075
02:18:17,681 --> 02:18:20,430
but what does that in feet per second?
Oh No.

3076
02:18:20,460 --> 02:18:25,090
Cause just google t 206 miles an hour 
equals feet per second.

3077
02:18:25,180 --> 02:18:29,590
Find out what the fuck that means in 
feet per second.

3078
02:18:31,540 --> 02:18:32,373
We think it is 302 okay.
So that's about what you would expect 

3079
02:18:36,550 --> 02:18:40,720
from like a top and bow with a fairly 
light arrow.

3080
02:18:40,750 --> 02:18:41,583
But like I said,
most people try to keep their Arrow's a 

3081
02:18:43,781 --> 02:18:45,760
little slower than that,
believe it or not.

3082
02:18:45,761 --> 02:18:47,650
So what they would do is they'd make a 
heavier arrow.

3083
02:18:47,651 --> 02:18:48,484
So like if you had a 400 green Arrow and
you were coming in at 302 feet per 

3084
02:18:51,851 --> 02:18:52,684
second,
a lot of people would tell you you 

3085
02:18:54,461 --> 02:18:55,294
probably better off with a 450 green 
Arrow that comes in around to 70 

3086
02:18:59,651 --> 02:19:00,970
something like that.
Yeah,

3087
02:19:00,971 --> 02:19:03,220
to 70 to 80 yeah.
You want more control?

3088
02:19:03,430 --> 02:19:06,190
It's more forgiving.
And also it has more impact,

3089
02:19:06,220 --> 02:19:10,120
like a light Arrow going really fast as 
undo the damage that a heavy Arrow going

3090
02:19:10,121 --> 02:19:10,954
fast does.
So I same difference in golf than so 

3091
02:19:12,720 --> 02:19:14,740
they get more control over their boss so
they can sell.

3092
02:19:14,980 --> 02:19:17,620
So it lands somewhere they want it to 
land as opposed to just go on.

3093
02:19:17,740 --> 02:19:18,850
Yeah,
for sure.

3094
02:19:18,880 --> 02:19:21,550
That's the thing with pool to the break 
shot and pool.

3095
02:19:21,910 --> 02:19:22,743
Like there's arguments that uh,
like there's a guy named Shane van 

3096
02:19:24,671 --> 02:19:28,340
boning who's probably one of the best 
breakers in the history of pool.

3097
02:19:28,490 --> 02:19:29,323
He breaks so good but he doesn't put 
near the effort into it that all these 

3098
02:19:32,421 --> 02:19:34,790
other guys do.
Some other guys throw their body into it

3099
02:19:34,791 --> 02:19:35,624
like karate,
like they're fucking trying to kick 

3100
02:19:36,981 --> 02:19:40,340
through a wall and [inaudible] and they 
have this crazy impact on the balls.

3101
02:19:40,730 --> 02:19:41,563
But Shane,
what he does is he stays flat on the 

3102
02:19:43,731 --> 02:19:46,700
ball and he just strokes through it 
perfectly.

3103
02:19:46,701 --> 02:19:49,300
So the ball is almost never,
um,

3104
02:19:49,430 --> 02:19:52,070
in the air.
The problem with hitting pool ball,

3105
02:19:52,730 --> 02:19:56,420
like this guy is ridiculous break shot.
Like you can't tell from that picture,

3106
02:19:56,450 --> 02:19:58,820
but I've seen him do it live a bunch of 
times of,

3107
02:19:58,821 --> 02:20:01,910
of actually watched him play in person 
several times.

3108
02:20:01,911 --> 02:20:02,744
He's fucking amazing,
but he doesn't hit it as hard as other 

3109
02:20:05,241 --> 02:20:07,280
guys do.
He just hits it more perfect.

3110
02:20:07,281 --> 02:20:09,980
When you look at like high speed 
photography of a pool cue,

3111
02:20:10,340 --> 02:20:13,730
when a guy hits it really hard,
the ball is actually in the air,

3112
02:20:14,330 --> 02:20:15,920
like when it's in the air,
when it impacts,

3113
02:20:16,460 --> 02:20:18,050
like see how it hops like that too.

3114
02:20:18,050 --> 02:20:18,883
That's also just from the force of it.
But look at all these balls fucking 

3115
02:20:20,721 --> 02:20:23,060
flying all over the place.
It's ridiculous.

3116
02:20:23,061 --> 02:20:25,010
Like he's a,
he's a freak in that regard,

3117
02:20:25,011 --> 02:20:28,160
but it's just perfect accuracy and 
precision.

3118
02:20:28,161 --> 02:20:28,994
It's just,
it's a matter of like the perfect 

3119
02:20:30,231 --> 02:20:31,064
mechanics and the like this loose like 
fluid motion fluid and efficient motion 

3120
02:20:36,940 --> 02:20:39,020
and that's what they say is the same 
thing as about golf.

3121
02:20:39,390 --> 02:20:42,470
That driving and the ball that it's not 
about muscling it right.

3122
02:20:42,471 --> 02:20:44,410
It's about like driving through it.
Yeah.

3123
02:20:44,990 --> 02:20:47,450
Like when I play pool and I'm playing 
good,

3124
02:20:47,510 --> 02:20:48,343
like I'm never really good,
but when I'm better what happens is I 

3125
02:20:52,071 --> 02:20:55,490
get to a point where I'm just like the,
the q's doing all the work.

3126
02:20:55,730 --> 02:20:59,420
I'm just like letting,
I'm like moving into the spot and I just

3127
02:20:59,421 --> 02:21:00,254
like let it just sorta like,
I don't ever tighten my hand up on it 

3128
02:21:03,231 --> 02:21:05,510
and I don't punch it.
It just flows.

3129
02:21:05,511 --> 02:21:07,490
And when you do that,
it's crazy.

3130
02:21:07,491 --> 02:21:10,070
Like you see the ball moving way more 
than it normally does.

3131
02:21:10,250 --> 02:21:11,083
It's weird and it's just like this fluid
and efficient impact that it has with 

3132
02:21:15,891 --> 02:21:16,724
the ball.
And I guess that's the same with golf 

3133
02:21:18,021 --> 02:21:19,550
and with probably with everything,
right?

3134
02:21:21,790 --> 02:21:23,990
I don't know about everything but golf 
is definitely that you need,

3135
02:21:24,020 --> 02:21:25,670
it's like don't,
don't grip and rip.

3136
02:21:25,730 --> 02:21:27,650
Somebody will say grip and rip it.
It's how they do it.

3137
02:21:27,651 --> 02:21:29,570
But like you shouldn't be swinging like 
a baseball bat,

3138
02:21:29,571 --> 02:21:32,150
like swinging for home runs.
You're not going to succeed necessarily.

3139
02:21:32,151 --> 02:21:32,984
That's the same as fighting.
But in finding the other way works to 

3140
02:21:36,180 --> 02:21:37,100
fight.
It's weird.

3141
02:21:37,101 --> 02:21:40,040
It's like there's no hard fast rule.
Like someone can come down,

3142
02:21:40,041 --> 02:21:40,874
bite down their mouthpiece and real 
fucking haymakers and catch you in the 

3143
02:21:43,401 --> 02:21:46,010
Chin and knock you out cold or someone 
can.

3144
02:21:46,011 --> 02:21:46,844
Conor mcgregor,
you like the way conor Mcgregor Aldo 

3145
02:21:48,891 --> 02:21:53,270
mode when he,
when he knocked out Aldo with one punch,

3146
02:21:53,271 --> 02:21:55,910
13 seconds into the fight,
the way he did it was just precision.

3147
02:21:56,150 --> 02:21:56,983
He just slid back on a back,
just dropped it in there and all those 

3148
02:21:59,721 --> 02:22:02,450
face went squirrely and his brain went 
off.

3149
02:22:02,720 --> 02:22:07,720
I mean that's like the perfect example 
of precision versus power cause with,

3150
02:22:08,210 --> 02:22:10,400
although does he bites down on his 
mouthpiece,

3151
02:22:10,401 --> 02:22:12,320
any wings is vicious.
Left Hook.

3152
02:22:12,740 --> 02:22:13,573
He throws us right hand like this and he
throws his vicious left hook behind it 

3153
02:22:17,060 --> 02:22:18,920
and it's all to try to set up the left 
Tuck.

3154
02:22:19,190 --> 02:22:24,070
Connor slides out of the way,
drops his left hand in on Aldo while all

3155
02:22:24,080 --> 02:22:28,170
those throw in the left hook and then 
left hook kinda makes impact on Connor's

3156
02:22:28,171 --> 02:22:29,004
face but probably didn't have much more 
than momentum behind it because all it 

3157
02:22:32,921 --> 02:22:35,370
was already out.
Like the punch was perfect.

3158
02:22:36,960 --> 02:22:40,370
That's got to haunt you.
But the way he did it,

3159
02:22:40,371 --> 02:22:42,860
man,
it was just all precision like watch.

3160
02:22:42,950 --> 02:22:44,130
We'll play it,
play it back again.

3161
02:22:44,160 --> 02:22:45,530
Watch this now.
It'll play it from the beginning.

3162
02:22:45,531 --> 02:22:46,221
There you go.
Watch it.

3163
02:22:46,221 --> 02:22:48,350
Slide blank.
See,

3164
02:22:48,351 --> 02:22:49,184
he got tagged like right on the 
cheekbone and that could have been a 

3165
02:22:51,531 --> 02:22:52,364
double knockout.
Imagine if he got tagged on the Chin on 

3166
02:22:54,621 --> 02:22:57,800
the point of the chin.
That guy is a savage.

3167
02:22:58,280 --> 02:23:00,320
I'm so glad people like conor mcgregor 
exists.

3168
02:23:00,321 --> 02:23:01,790
Look at this.
Boom.

3169
02:23:02,960 --> 02:23:04,370
Just flattened him.
One shot.

3170
02:23:04,400 --> 02:23:06,350
Blam Bam.

3171
02:23:08,050 --> 02:23:11,380
That's some strong mind.
Power their baby.

3172
02:23:11,680 --> 02:23:12,513
To be able to stay that calm in the heat
of a firefight and just slide out and 

3173
02:23:15,971 --> 02:23:17,980
just precision.
Drop a punch in a box.

3174
02:23:19,580 --> 02:23:20,413
Dude.

3175
02:23:22,010 --> 02:23:22,691
Foamy Brian,
look,

3176
02:23:22,691 --> 02:23:23,720
you fall asleep.
Yeah,

3177
02:23:23,800 --> 02:23:26,620
guys gone.
What happened to you either?

3178
02:23:26,630 --> 02:23:28,270
You know I,
I'm on tod.

3179
02:23:28,420 --> 02:23:29,253
TMD.
So at the snapchat talking about conor 

3180
02:23:31,630 --> 02:23:32,463
[inaudible] you don't have character,
but that the comparisons to snatch to 

3181
02:23:35,860 --> 02:23:37,310
connor,
like the character of that,

3182
02:23:37,311 --> 02:23:38,360
whatever Brad Pitt was.
No,

3183
02:23:38,361 --> 02:23:40,370
it's terrible.
That guy couldn't talk.

3184
02:23:40,910 --> 02:23:43,070
That's the character.
That's fucking terrible.

3185
02:23:43,170 --> 02:23:44,990
Who compared them?
I see stuff online.

3186
02:23:46,070 --> 02:23:47,840
People are so stupid.
Most people should.

3187
02:23:47,990 --> 02:23:50,390
You should have a license to talk.
Oh it's the worst.

3188
02:23:50,391 --> 02:23:52,880
You'd have to,
you'd have to go through in order to use

3189
02:23:52,881 --> 02:23:55,580
social media you should have to like go 
through an extensive test.

3190
02:23:55,970 --> 02:23:56,803
You're like people are so addicted to 
twitter and instagram and all that 

3191
02:23:58,881 --> 02:23:59,714
stuff.
You should go through an extensive like 

3192
02:24:01,341 --> 02:24:02,750
spelling tests.
I should.

3193
02:24:02,930 --> 02:24:03,763
Well how do you say you are?
Do you say while you are or did you say 

3194
02:24:06,021 --> 02:24:06,854
you are,
do you say y o u Apostrophe r e or that 

3195
02:24:11,031 --> 02:24:13,370
you are,
no you are.

3196
02:24:14,090 --> 02:24:18,080
Does Eddie still do that?
Remember when he used to do it long time

3197
02:24:18,081 --> 02:24:21,080
ago he was going hard with the texting 
early on.

3198
02:24:21,360 --> 02:24:24,140
A lot girls do.
Getting rid of comment sections.

3199
02:24:24,450 --> 02:24:28,150
What like that for places for people to 
comment way?

3200
02:24:28,630 --> 02:24:29,463
Well like vice is one of them.
It's not a bad idea in some serve 

3201
02:24:32,690 --> 02:24:33,523
certain circles cause some things it's 
interesting like I love reading science 

3202
02:24:37,341 --> 02:24:39,650
articles where people start debating 
like uh,

3203
02:24:39,700 --> 02:24:42,110
the legitimacy at certain points or you 
know,

3204
02:24:42,111 --> 02:24:44,240
what,
what are the options for considering the

3205
02:24:44,241 --> 02:24:46,010
evidence?
Is there anything else that made,

3206
02:24:46,340 --> 02:24:47,173
maybe it's being overlooked and you get 
some really interesting responses from 

3207
02:24:49,821 --> 02:24:51,290
people that actually understand the 
subject.

3208
02:24:51,950 --> 02:24:52,783
But man,
as soon as it says anything to do with 

3209
02:24:55,160 --> 02:24:58,730
politics or gender,
those two fucking things,

3210
02:24:58,731 --> 02:25:00,500
man,
those two things,

3211
02:25:00,770 --> 02:25:04,550
everybody gets nuts.
There was a video that MTV put out.

3212
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:05,833
Um,
it was a new year's resolutions for 

3213
02:25:08,241 --> 02:25:11,180
white guys.
It was one of the worst fucking,

3214
02:25:11,181 --> 02:25:14,660
most racist,
sexist videos of every tweet that it was

3215
02:25:14,661 --> 02:25:15,494
so ridiculous.
Like I imagine if anybody had ever made 

3216
02:25:18,291 --> 02:25:21,110
a video like that about any 
generalization,

3217
02:25:21,180 --> 02:25:23,770
about a hundred million people and what 
it is,

3218
02:25:23,771 --> 02:25:25,210
it's a general,
like if you say,

3219
02:25:25,450 --> 02:25:28,630
how many white guys are in America?
Let's,

3220
02:25:28,631 --> 02:25:31,660
let's just guess how many white males 
are in America.

3221
02:25:31,661 --> 02:25:36,090
Not Enough.
Princess Leia is dot.

3222
02:25:36,190 --> 02:25:37,860
Had a heart attack.
She's okay right now though.

3223
02:25:38,230 --> 02:25:39,220
She's stable.
Okay.

3224
02:25:39,221 --> 02:25:43,030
How many?
62% of the US population is white.

3225
02:25:43,150 --> 02:25:46,570
62% of us.
What percentage of white males?

3226
02:25:46,780 --> 02:25:48,370
White,
white males,

3227
02:25:48,460 --> 02:25:51,180
the majority,
which is about 77%.

3228
02:25:51,190 --> 02:25:54,360
That's how many white males and males 
though,

3229
02:25:54,370 --> 02:25:56,470
white men or 31% of the population 
there.

3230
02:25:56,650 --> 02:25:57,483
Okay,
so we're 31% of the population is 350 

3231
02:26:00,790 --> 02:26:01,623
million people.
Somewhere around a hundred million 

3232
02:26:03,971 --> 02:26:04,750
people,
right?

3233
02:26:04,750 --> 02:26:07,300
It's in that neighborhood between 80 and
a hundred million.

3234
02:26:07,300 --> 02:26:10,810
Right?
That's what a crazy thing to generalize,

3235
02:26:11,500 --> 02:26:14,650
like just to make a video about white 
men.

3236
02:26:15,370 --> 02:26:16,960
She was like,
hey white guys.

3237
02:26:17,440 --> 02:26:19,690
How about you get your shit together?
Like just white guys?

3238
02:26:19,720 --> 02:26:22,210
Just white guys like,
Holy Shit.

3239
02:26:22,420 --> 02:26:24,370
Do you want to do this about black guys 
too?

3240
02:26:24,550 --> 02:26:26,680
Why don't you see what happens when you 
do it about black guys?

3241
02:26:26,800 --> 02:26:27,633
How about you do it about black women?
See how quick somebody beats the fuck 

3242
02:26:29,501 --> 02:26:30,334
out of you?
How come you can do that about white 

3243
02:26:32,291 --> 02:26:33,124
guys like this?
The idea is that white men are the 

3244
02:26:36,041 --> 02:26:39,010
privileged and that white men have this 
advantage,

3245
02:26:39,011 --> 02:26:41,880
so you should attack that advantage by 
being racist towards them.

3246
02:26:41,970 --> 02:26:42,803
I was,
the best way to stop racism is to be 

3247
02:26:44,171 --> 02:26:46,120
racist towards people who you think are 
racist.

3248
02:26:46,450 --> 02:26:49,600
It's hilarious.
It's so stupid.

3249
02:26:50,770 --> 02:26:51,780
It's so like,
it's,

3250
02:26:51,830 --> 02:26:53,360
it's unbelievable that MTV news stuff,

3251
02:26:53,530 --> 02:26:55,810
they should do a video like that.
What's really bad?

3252
02:26:55,840 --> 02:26:57,430
Mtvs the worse.
I mean,

3253
02:26:57,880 --> 02:27:00,070
have you watched it on TV recently?
I'm sorry?

3254
02:27:00,071 --> 02:27:01,030
Do you,
do you like MTV?

3255
02:27:01,070 --> 02:27:02,850
No,
I try,

3256
02:27:02,980 --> 02:27:05,140
I to watch TV anymore.
I don't have cable anymore,

3257
02:27:05,141 --> 02:27:06,040
so I have,
you know,

3258
02:27:06,041 --> 02:27:09,150
a psv or whatever or a sling and,
uh,

3259
02:27:09,370 --> 02:27:12,910
so I have certain channels I normally,
but not as many as I used to have.

3260
02:27:12,911 --> 02:27:13,744
So like,
I'll watch mtv more just because I have 

3261
02:27:15,731 --> 02:27:17,470
it.
It's one of 30 channels,

3262
02:27:17,830 --> 02:27:18,663
but MTV is just garbage channel now.
There's nothing that we're too old for 

3263
02:27:22,451 --> 02:27:23,021
it.
That's like,

3264
02:27:23,021 --> 02:27:26,210
you have to be 18 to 22 to have any 
food.

3265
02:27:26,211 --> 02:27:27,180
They have that show.

3266
02:27:27,280 --> 02:27:29,610
What does it ridiculous is that on MTV?
God,

3267
02:27:30,070 --> 02:27:30,903
that shows just saw a bunch of like 
videos of people getting jacked on the 

3268
02:27:33,251 --> 02:27:34,084
Internet.
Right.

3269
02:27:34,510 --> 02:27:35,620
And then,
um,

3270
02:27:35,800 --> 02:27:37,780
everything else is,
they don't have videos anymore.

3271
02:27:37,840 --> 02:27:38,673
Right.
It's not,

3272
02:27:38,720 --> 02:27:39,940
you know,
videos on Youtube.

3273
02:27:39,941 --> 02:27:43,180
Every videos on Sunday one.
What a weird time.

3274
02:27:43,350 --> 02:27:43,951
Yeah.
But you know,

3275
02:27:43,951 --> 02:27:44,784
it was cool and they had videos as you 
learned about new bands because you saw 

3276
02:27:47,371 --> 02:27:48,120
their video.

3277
02:27:48,120 --> 02:27:49,380
Yeah,
but nobody wants to watch those anymore.

3278
02:27:49,570 --> 02:27:52,500
Yeah,
I guess they played videos versus people

3279
02:27:52,501 --> 02:27:53,334
falling on their head.
People go to fall on their head every 

3280
02:27:54,750 --> 02:27:56,820
day,
so they just went where the money is.

3281
02:27:57,150 --> 02:27:57,983
So this is the idea is that like they're
just trying to appeal to social justice 

3282
02:28:00,121 --> 02:28:03,630
warriors by making this video.
There's one girl in the video,

3283
02:28:03,631 --> 02:28:07,080
she goes find out what mansplaining is 
and then don't do it.

3284
02:28:07,530 --> 02:28:08,363
Hell like find out what like what a 
ridiculous idea that you can be 

3285
02:28:13,351 --> 02:28:14,184
condescending about someone being 
condescending and that that somehow or 

3286
02:28:18,361 --> 02:28:21,030
another is going to work like that.
All the thought,

3287
02:28:21,350 --> 02:28:24,170
making a video like that,
it's exactly how trump got elected.

3288
02:28:24,260 --> 02:28:25,093
When you tell people what to do,
they automatically want to do the other 

3289
02:28:27,771 --> 02:28:28,604
thing.
Even if they wouldn't want to do the 

3290
02:28:29,901 --> 02:28:31,310
other thing if you hadn't said Shit.

3291
02:28:31,640 --> 02:28:32,473
But when you push people and you tell 
people just if you make up ridiculous 

3292
02:28:36,141 --> 02:28:36,974
standards the way people are supposed to
behave because you think they should 

3293
02:28:38,931 --> 02:28:39,764
behave like that and that you are 
allowed to make gigantic gross 

3294
02:28:42,441 --> 02:28:43,274
generalizations about an entire group of
100 million people just because you 

3295
02:28:47,091 --> 02:28:47,924
think it's open season on white guys 
like that is how people like trump get 

3296
02:28:51,351 --> 02:28:52,184
elected because people push back against
your ridiculous political correctness 

3297
02:28:55,610 --> 02:28:56,443
and go towards what's the enemy of that?
What's the enemy up political 

3298
02:28:58,941 --> 02:28:59,774
correctness that pussy grabbing guy,
let's fucking vote them in and that's 

3299
02:29:01,701 --> 02:29:03,950
what happens.
That's exactly what happens.

3300
02:29:04,370 --> 02:29:07,730
These people are,
the people that are so mad that trump is

3301
02:29:07,731 --> 02:29:08,564
in office are directly responsible for 
it hordes of people voting for trump 

3302
02:29:12,980 --> 02:29:16,730
because they are sick of where the the 
PC generation is pointing.

3303
02:29:16,800 --> 02:29:19,700
It's an irrational point of view.
It's not objective.

3304
02:29:19,701 --> 02:29:20,534
It's not,
if anything has to do with gender or 

3305
02:29:22,311 --> 02:29:23,144
homosexuality,
whoever has to do with any of those 

3306
02:29:24,741 --> 02:29:27,470
things is no longer considered as an 
individual.

3307
02:29:27,590 --> 02:29:28,423
Then you're considered as a part of an 
untouchable group that is almost always 

3308
02:29:31,281 --> 02:29:33,110
exonerated of anything they've done 
wrong.

3309
02:29:33,530 --> 02:29:34,363
It cheats.
You get to this weird fake world where 

3310
02:29:36,441 --> 02:29:40,010
people aren't people anymore.
They're figureheads for ideologies.

3311
02:29:40,500 --> 02:29:41,333
That's a problem with political 
correctness as much as it's a problem 

3312
02:29:43,431 --> 02:29:46,390
with people that are super right wing or
people that are born again Christians.

3313
02:29:46,391 --> 02:29:46,670
Right.

3314
02:29:46,670 --> 02:29:47,503
It's fucking up comedy like so many 
comedians have been talking about 

3315
02:29:50,691 --> 02:29:51,524
lately.
How like they've had to stop themselves 

3316
02:29:53,451 --> 02:29:55,340
on stage,
you know,

3317
02:29:55,370 --> 02:29:56,203
and not go down a route.
They normally would always go down 

3318
02:29:58,520 --> 02:29:59,870
because of the recent,
you know,

3319
02:29:59,900 --> 02:30:02,720
racist shit and a pc shit sewed much 
different,

3320
02:30:02,780 --> 02:30:04,730
you know,
in the last even six months.

3321
02:30:05,180 --> 02:30:07,910
Well there's definitely more pushback 
but there's always been pushed back.

3322
02:30:08,330 --> 02:30:09,440
Have you noticed a change?
Have you,

3323
02:30:09,441 --> 02:30:12,590
have you noticed like certain things you
won't say now or do now or,

3324
02:30:12,740 --> 02:30:15,080
well it makes you just back up what you 
want to say better.

3325
02:30:15,200 --> 02:30:17,420
It makes you reinforce your arguments 
better.

3326
02:30:17,510 --> 02:30:19,280
It makes you,
if you're going to have something to say

3327
02:30:19,281 --> 02:30:20,900
to people,
you have to have,

3328
02:30:22,830 --> 02:30:23,663
you know,
you have to have a real point and you'd 

3329
02:30:25,201 --> 02:30:26,970
have to be able to back up what you're 
saying.

3330
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:28,530
You have to be able explain what you're 
saying.

3331
02:30:28,930 --> 02:30:32,640
It's why I did that whole bit about am I
not my last,

3332
02:30:32,670 --> 02:30:34,850
not in triggered the Netflix special,
but the one before that,

3333
02:30:34,860 --> 02:30:39,360
the comedy central special about words 
about how like you can't,

3334
02:30:39,510 --> 02:30:44,510
you can't just decide that jokes aren't 
real

3335
02:30:45,180 --> 02:30:45,410
okay.

3336
02:30:45,410 --> 02:30:46,243
Or rather the jokes are real.
Like when someone's telling a joke on 

3337
02:30:48,091 --> 02:30:48,531
stage,
like,

3338
02:30:48,531 --> 02:30:50,540
you know,
that guy doesn't mean what he's saying.

3339
02:30:50,900 --> 02:30:53,540
So that's why when I'm in that special,
I said,

3340
02:30:53,600 --> 02:30:55,730
I'm going to say some things that are 
true,

3341
02:30:56,510 --> 02:30:58,850
but I'm gonna say a lot of shit that's 
funnier than the truth.

3342
02:30:58,970 --> 02:31:02,000
So I'm going to lie.
Like if it's Funnier to lie,

3343
02:31:02,001 --> 02:31:03,190
I'm going to lie.
Like you got to know.

3344
02:31:03,270 --> 02:31:05,720
Sometimes I'm gonna tell you the truth,
you know,

3345
02:31:06,310 --> 02:31:08,090
and I go and sometimes I'm going to say,
shit,

3346
02:31:08,091 --> 02:31:10,610
that's not true at all because it's 
funnier than the truth.

3347
02:31:10,850 --> 02:31:11,720
Like,
here's some truth.

3348
02:31:11,960 --> 02:31:16,640
My wife is tired of fucking me.
And then people say that quite a bit.

3349
02:31:16,940 --> 02:31:18,420
But,
but,

3350
02:31:18,800 --> 02:31:20,190
but she never says no

3351
02:31:20,220 --> 02:31:23,190
because if she did,
I'd raper and I'm like,

3352
02:31:23,191 --> 02:31:24,600
I'm joking.
I would never rape her.

3353
02:31:24,601 --> 02:31:25,590
See,
that's not true.

3354
02:31:25,591 --> 02:31:27,060
I go,
the worst I would do is hold it down and

3355
02:31:27,061 --> 02:31:29,430
titty fucker butt cheek.
I wouldn't do that either.

3356
02:31:29,460 --> 02:31:31,620
These is not true statements.
I would never do that thing.

3357
02:31:31,621 --> 02:31:34,590
She's the mother of my children.
I wouldn't do that.

3358
02:31:34,650 --> 02:31:36,960
But you could say that.
And you know,

3359
02:31:36,961 --> 02:31:39,030
I'm not being honest.
You know that's not true.

3360
02:31:39,180 --> 02:31:40,020
You know,
that's,

3361
02:31:40,140 --> 02:31:41,580
that's a joke.
You know,

3362
02:31:41,581 --> 02:31:44,130
when someone says something fucking 
ridiculous like that,

3363
02:31:44,540 --> 02:31:48,660
that they don't mean it to joke like,
like when Brian Holt's,

3364
02:31:48,661 --> 02:31:51,420
when used to have that joke about that 
woman who drowned her kids,

3365
02:31:52,110 --> 02:31:53,400
he goes,
I heard those were bad kids.

3366
02:31:53,690 --> 02:31:56,430
I heard they sat that close to the TV.
They never put away their blocks.

3367
02:31:56,700 --> 02:31:59,580
The kids would not be missed though,
is spelt their milk.

3368
02:32:00,110 --> 02:32:01,980
No.
It's like Holy Shit.

3369
02:32:02,280 --> 02:32:04,590
But you knew that he didn't really think
that,

3370
02:32:04,620 --> 02:32:05,453
which was the whole point of it.
That's the problem with today is people 

3371
02:32:08,220 --> 02:32:09,053
just looking to call people out for shit
they don't think people should say 

3372
02:32:10,741 --> 02:32:11,870
anymore.
You know?

3373
02:32:11,880 --> 02:32:13,020
And in some ways,
maybe they're right.

3374
02:32:13,800 --> 02:32:14,633
I mean,
you'd go back to old stuff like go back 

3375
02:32:16,141 --> 02:32:18,690
and try to watch Eddie Murphy raw and 
you're like,

3376
02:32:18,691 --> 02:32:19,524
wow,
I don't know if I'd be laughing at this 

3377
02:32:20,311 --> 02:32:21,031
now.
Yeah.

3378
02:32:21,031 --> 02:32:22,890
There's a lot of that shit too,
right?

3379
02:32:22,910 --> 02:32:24,060
I have no,
I saw,

3380
02:32:24,090 --> 02:32:25,170
fuck.
What movie was it?

3381
02:32:25,740 --> 02:32:30,000
Something something so innocent like I 
like ghostbusters,

3382
02:32:30,120 --> 02:32:30,953
the original ghostbusters something 
where they called somebody a certain 

3383
02:32:32,941 --> 02:32:33,774
name.
Like I think it was like they said 

3384
02:32:34,351 --> 02:32:35,070
Chink.
Hey,

3385
02:32:35,070 --> 02:32:35,540
yeah,
yeah.

3386
02:32:35,540 --> 02:32:36,600
Cenk like,
like,

3387
02:32:36,601 --> 02:32:37,434
whoa.
It was just like back then I remember 

3388
02:32:38,701 --> 02:32:40,340
going Oh,
chinks and had that bad.

3389
02:32:42,780 --> 02:32:46,500
Now there's no differentiation between 
shank and anything else.

3390
02:32:46,501 --> 02:32:47,790
Any other slur,
spic,

3391
02:32:47,810 --> 02:32:49,770
Chink and Spic,
or they're all the same.

3392
02:32:50,340 --> 02:32:53,070
Pretty much the racist bugs bunny and 
stuff from back in the day.

3393
02:32:53,220 --> 02:32:54,510
Yeah.
Yeah.

3394
02:32:54,610 --> 02:32:57,820
We've got Japanese people.
Funny Nips the nips or say,

3395
02:32:59,310 --> 02:33:00,510
well,
that was during World War II.

3396
02:33:01,450 --> 02:33:01,950
Yeah,
man,

3397
02:33:01,950 --> 02:33:04,560
we've changed.
Human beings have changed.

3398
02:33:04,561 --> 02:33:05,394
It's just funny when it comes to comedy,
we just have to be clear that we're 

3399
02:33:09,091 --> 02:33:09,924
fucking around.
Like people are allowed to say things 

3400
02:33:11,731 --> 02:33:13,420
that they don't really mean like,
well,

3401
02:33:13,430 --> 02:33:14,263
we were talking about this Donald Trump 
thing when he was interviewing that guy 

3402
02:33:17,100 --> 02:33:19,320
or it was on a bus with that guy and he 
said a bunch of shit about,

3403
02:33:19,620 --> 02:33:20,453
about women guys do that for fun.
They say shit like Joey Diaz is the 

3404
02:33:24,481 --> 02:33:25,314
master at that.
He'll say unbelievably ridiculous shit 

3405
02:33:27,901 --> 02:33:30,840
to you that you know,
he doesn't mean you know,

3406
02:33:30,870 --> 02:33:32,520
and you'll be just be crying,
laughing.

3407
02:33:33,090 --> 02:33:33,923
You know,
he's talking about stabbing people 

3408
02:33:35,161 --> 02:33:35,994
about,
we're throwing them out the fucking 

3409
02:33:36,601 --> 02:33:38,640
window and he doesn't mean it.
You know?

3410
02:33:38,641 --> 02:33:39,750
He doesn't mean it,
but it's funny.

3411
02:33:40,260 --> 02:33:42,210
What do you got to new screen doing 
nothing.

3412
02:33:42,211 --> 02:33:44,520
I was just like going to talk about 
something later and I said,

3413
02:33:44,700 --> 02:33:46,430
what does it now I want to spend problem
with it.

3414
02:33:46,440 --> 02:33:47,880
That's why I tell you to put those 
things away.

3415
02:33:47,910 --> 02:33:50,370
I want to continue always.
You always want to start surfing.

3416
02:33:50,400 --> 02:33:52,570
You're so addicted.
I'm not addicted.

3417
02:33:52,571 --> 02:33:53,404
You got to have a conversation.
You can't just stare at that fucking 

3418
02:33:54,841 --> 02:33:57,210
screen.
Those goddamn things will suck you in.

3419
02:33:58,860 --> 02:33:59,940
They do.
They suck you in,

3420
02:33:59,941 --> 02:34:00,810
dude.
You can't help it.

3421
02:34:01,080 --> 02:34:02,040
I start talking.
You're like,

3422
02:34:02,041 --> 02:34:02,970
well,
I'm not talking right now.

3423
02:34:02,971 --> 02:34:04,430
Let me just sharp this web here real 
quick.

3424
02:34:04,490 --> 02:34:05,720
Sure.
No,

3425
02:34:05,750 --> 02:34:08,430
I was just trying to find it.
I just hate when instead of going,

3426
02:34:08,460 --> 02:34:11,190
well I think this and this and that,
I'd rather like go,

3427
02:34:11,400 --> 02:34:12,151
okay.
It is true.

3428
02:34:12,151 --> 02:34:15,050
So before I even go back down that way 
you don't get it.

3429
02:34:15,060 --> 02:34:17,870
It's kind of like live fact checking,
but just

3430
02:34:17,980 --> 02:34:19,930
ask Jamie.
He'll check it for you.

3431
02:34:20,770 --> 02:34:22,260
He's trying.
No,

3432
02:34:22,330 --> 02:34:24,790
don't remember about what would you want
to talk about?

3433
02:34:25,150 --> 02:34:27,310
Nothing.
Jesus Christ wasn't sure.

3434
02:34:28,270 --> 02:34:30,280
What was it that you thought you were 
just talking about?

3435
02:34:30,281 --> 02:34:31,114
I don't know.
You weren't at a point about what you 

3436
02:34:33,231 --> 02:34:35,590
were talking about now.
I can't remember what it was about.

3437
02:34:35,620 --> 02:34:36,453
You were just talking about Donald Trump
and Billy Bush on the bus talking about 

3438
02:34:39,701 --> 02:34:41,500
Joey Dia saying ridiculous things that,
you know,

3439
02:34:41,501 --> 02:34:43,510
he doesn't really mean that anybody 
doing it.

3440
02:34:43,540 --> 02:34:44,373
But the thing with Joey is,
is that he says ridiculous things mixed 

3441
02:34:46,571 --> 02:34:47,404
with things that are true,
but you don't know which they're real 

3442
02:34:50,341 --> 02:34:51,530
and are fake.
You know,

3443
02:34:51,890 --> 02:34:54,580
journalism bugging the fag in or are 
true though.

3444
02:34:54,620 --> 02:34:55,510
Yeah,
I know it's true.

3445
02:34:55,660 --> 02:34:58,390
But how much is true?
Like you know the shit out of him.

3446
02:34:58,750 --> 02:35:00,250
He told me that story a long time ago.

3447
02:35:00,400 --> 02:35:01,233
He tried to sucker punch this guy and 
the guy was gay and the guy knew how to 

3448
02:35:03,101 --> 02:35:06,290
fight and the guy beat the shit out of 
him and he's beating the shit out of him

3449
02:35:06,291 --> 02:35:07,750
while I was calling for the cops.
You've got,

3450
02:35:07,751 --> 02:35:09,800
you got new in a box or the guy that he 
liked,

3451
02:35:09,910 --> 02:35:12,260
the guy brought it over all the cocaine,
you know,

3452
02:35:12,310 --> 02:35:13,780
and he like,
he went to jail.

3453
02:35:14,010 --> 02:35:15,060
Joey's a liar.
No,

3454
02:35:15,061 --> 02:35:15,610
no,
no,

3455
02:35:15,610 --> 02:35:16,001
no,
no.

3456
02:35:16,001 --> 02:35:17,200
I'm saying you're in trouble.
I'm like,

3457
02:35:17,201 --> 02:35:18,340
God,
I think you're missing.

3458
02:35:18,510 --> 02:35:19,343
You know what I'm saying?
That he has stories like those mixed in 

3459
02:35:21,551 --> 02:35:25,600
with stories that aren't real.
So it's like you're really confused that

3460
02:35:25,810 --> 02:35:26,643
like you know,
which is real and which is not probably 

3461
02:35:28,481 --> 02:35:29,880
the only one confused.
No,

3462
02:35:29,890 --> 02:35:31,390
no.
Like when he's telling jokes.

3463
02:35:31,450 --> 02:35:33,190
Yeah.
I mean all right Jamie,

3464
02:35:33,191 --> 02:35:34,610
does joey confuse,
you know,

3465
02:35:34,670 --> 02:35:35,560
seems pretty direct.

3466
02:35:35,590 --> 02:35:37,070
Yeah.
Cause it,

3467
02:35:37,240 --> 02:35:40,780
cause it seems like when you know some 
of the stuff that you think is that Oh,

3468
02:35:40,940 --> 02:35:44,620
physicists jokes or his ridiculous stuff
might actually be real.

3469
02:35:45,010 --> 02:35:45,843
Well the problem with Julie's,
his life has been so crazy and so 

3470
02:35:47,621 --> 02:35:48,454
colorful so that he'll still to this day
tell me stories that I haven't heard 

3471
02:35:51,881 --> 02:35:53,980
before.
I'm like how do you have more stores?

3472
02:35:54,040 --> 02:35:55,030
Yeah,
exactly.

3473
02:35:55,090 --> 02:35:56,970
But he does,
it's just whole,

3474
02:35:56,980 --> 02:35:57,813
I think his whole life from the time he 
was like a little boy until he was like 

3475
02:36:01,181 --> 02:36:02,014
into his forties was just chaos.
So he's just has a good solid 30 years 

3476
02:36:07,091 --> 02:36:10,420
of chaos stories,
like legitimate chaos stories.

3477
02:36:10,460 --> 02:36:11,800
Have you seen this new specialty?
I don't see.

3478
02:36:11,801 --> 02:36:14,560
So you just coupon code joey for two 
months.

3479
02:36:14,590 --> 02:36:16,120
Have you seen it yet?
I have not seen it yet.

3480
02:36:16,121 --> 02:36:16,871
Have you seen it?
No,

3481
02:36:16,871 --> 02:36:17,470
I haven't.

3482
02:36:17,470 --> 02:36:19,480
I that's one of those weird networks 
that are like,

3483
02:36:19,510 --> 02:36:20,560
yeah,
you got to sign up,

3484
02:36:20,950 --> 02:36:21,783
right?
Yeah.

3485
02:36:22,030 --> 02:36:24,210
And it's weird to cancel I probably or 
something.

3486
02:36:24,211 --> 02:36:25,420
I hope it does.
Well,

3487
02:36:25,720 --> 02:36:26,860
I really do.
And I hope,

3488
02:36:26,890 --> 02:36:27,581
uh,
I mean,

3489
02:36:27,581 --> 02:36:29,650
cso of course,
I hope Joey's thinks does well,

3490
02:36:29,651 --> 02:36:30,484
but I hope also the,
they put port their stuff to other 

3491
02:36:31,991 --> 02:36:34,630
places once they get their money back.
So a lot of times they'll do that.

3492
02:36:34,631 --> 02:36:35,464
They'll sell them again somewhere else.
If somebody special just was released 

3493
02:36:38,020 --> 02:36:38,853
like on Seeso,
like Nick Thune or something like 

3494
02:36:40,001 --> 02:36:43,300
yesterday and it says available on 
[inaudible] and Amazon.

3495
02:36:43,570 --> 02:36:45,100
Hmm,
that's a good deal.

3496
02:36:45,160 --> 02:36:47,800
That's you're going to get the dorks on 
Amazon.

3497
02:36:47,980 --> 02:36:51,550
But how many people are really using 
Amazon to watch movies?

3498
02:36:51,551 --> 02:36:54,290
Like netflix would probably be like way 
ahead of Amazon.

3499
02:36:54,630 --> 02:36:56,830
A lot of people don't know that.
If they have Amazon prime,

3500
02:36:56,900 --> 02:36:58,670
do you get access to that APP?
It's also,

3501
02:36:58,690 --> 02:36:59,523
you get,
you don't get everything because they 

3502
02:37:00,161 --> 02:37:00,994
try to,
uh,

3503
02:37:01,040 --> 02:37:01,873
they work in,
they're like rental movies and stuff in 

3504
02:37:04,241 --> 02:37:05,310
that APP too.
Right.

3505
02:37:05,311 --> 02:37:07,390
You get a decent amount of content for 
free.

3506
02:37:08,290 --> 02:37:09,850
There's a whole music app you get to.
Yeah,

3507
02:37:09,851 --> 02:37:10,780
it's pretty good.
Um,

3508
02:37:11,050 --> 02:37:11,883
they also have that top gear show,
which they said is the most illegally 

3509
02:37:15,560 --> 02:37:16,520
show in history.

3510
02:37:16,580 --> 02:37:17,360
Wow.
The new one,

3511
02:37:17,360 --> 02:37:18,193
the new one,
they said the first episode in 

3512
02:37:19,191 --> 02:37:23,420
particular is the most illegally 
downloaded episode of a show ever.

3513
02:37:23,510 --> 02:37:27,050
So I'm way more people download it 
illegally than watch it on Amazon.

3514
02:37:27,530 --> 02:37:29,110
Well,
it is crazy because they,

3515
02:37:29,360 --> 02:37:32,930
they paid a shit load of money for that.
And the idea is that,

3516
02:37:32,931 --> 02:37:34,870
well,
once it gets on Amazon,

3517
02:37:34,880 --> 02:37:35,713
a bunch of people jump over to Amazon 
because that was the number one TV show 

3518
02:37:37,791 --> 02:37:38,624
in the world that,
that show top gear with Richard Hammond 

3519
02:37:41,721 --> 02:37:46,721
and James May and those guys that that's
there a giant team.

3520
02:37:47,300 --> 02:37:48,133
I mean,
when it comes to like the whole world 

3521
02:37:49,641 --> 02:37:53,330
watching a show,
that's probably the most watched show in

3522
02:37:53,331 --> 02:37:56,990
the world and it's on Amazon in general.
It's just them driving around mostly and

3523
02:37:56,991 --> 02:37:59,750
just like talking shit to each other 
talking shit.

3524
02:37:59,990 --> 02:38:00,823
It's funny.
They're funny to fire somebody recently 

3525
02:38:02,661 --> 02:38:03,650
that was on that show.

3526
02:38:03,650 --> 02:38:04,071
The,
yeah,

3527
02:38:04,071 --> 02:38:04,970
the main guy.
He,

3528
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:08,140
what's the fuck's his name again?
On the main rovers version?

3529
02:38:08,630 --> 02:38:10,490
I'm the one that's in the BBC.
Yeah.

3530
02:38:10,760 --> 02:38:11,840
Chris.
No,

3531
02:38:11,841 --> 02:38:13,250
no,
the the the the real one.

3532
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:15,350
Yeah.
Jimmy Claxton.

3533
02:38:15,380 --> 02:38:16,213
Jimmy Claxton.
Yeah.

3534
02:38:16,430 --> 02:38:17,263
It escaped me that weed.
I've been in the weeds but Jeremy 

3535
02:38:19,750 --> 02:38:21,230
Clarkson's hilarious.
He's really funny.

3536
02:38:21,350 --> 02:38:24,380
He says a lot of fucking hilarious shit 
and he talks shit about companies too.

3537
02:38:24,620 --> 02:38:25,453
He talks about he reviews cars in a way 
that like no other no American show 

3538
02:38:29,031 --> 02:38:30,790
would ever be able to do.
You never be able to get away with it.

3539
02:38:30,810 --> 02:38:33,460
He shits on them like he shits on 
Porsche's.

3540
02:38:33,470 --> 02:38:34,303
He hates Porsche is it calls them like 
vw bugs and Bionics in four k which is 

3541
02:38:37,671 --> 02:38:38,610
one of the things.
Is that good?

3542
02:38:38,690 --> 02:38:40,460
Like I say,
same with Netflix originals.

3543
02:38:40,520 --> 02:38:41,353
It's one of the only things.
It's a four k content for your new four 

3544
02:38:43,731 --> 02:38:44,480
K tv.

3545
02:38:44,480 --> 02:38:47,000
If people are looking for shit,
this is hard.

3546
02:38:47,180 --> 02:38:48,440
It's hard to find.
So anyway,

3547
02:38:48,470 --> 02:38:49,303
people take and then they upload it and 
it's just uploaded like crazy all over 

3548
02:38:52,461 --> 02:38:53,294
those bit torrents and all those 
different sites and just millions and 

3549
02:38:56,240 --> 02:38:57,140
millions and millions of people are 
downloading it.

3550
02:38:57,141 --> 02:38:57,974
So you've got to think of how much 
Amazon paid for it and then how few 

3551
02:39:00,021 --> 02:39:00,854
people are actually using their service.
But if you had to guess like how many 

3552
02:39:05,841 --> 02:39:10,410
more people use netflix than anything 
else as far as like Amazon or Hulu or,

3553
02:39:10,500 --> 02:39:13,940
I use Hulu more than I use netflix now.
I barely use netflix anymore.

3554
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:16,400
I use Hulu all the time now.
What do you get on Hulu?

3555
02:39:16,740 --> 02:39:17,573
Uh,
like all the,

3556
02:39:17,650 --> 02:39:18,483
like the local channel is like really 
like stuff like that you get local TV 

3557
02:39:22,420 --> 02:39:23,870
channel.
I mean like the,

3558
02:39:23,871 --> 02:39:24,704
like the NBC shows that CBS shows that 
Fox shows the news and all those other 

3559
02:39:29,391 --> 02:39:30,560
things like NBC News.

3560
02:39:30,590 --> 02:39:31,940
No,
I get that on sling.

3561
02:39:32,320 --> 02:39:34,040
Uh,
and Psu.

3562
02:39:34,550 --> 02:39:37,170
What's that?
Playstation you sling is like,

3563
02:39:37,190 --> 02:39:39,110
uh,
like live TV.

3564
02:39:39,290 --> 02:39:40,123
So,
but you can pick and choose which way 

3565
02:39:41,031 --> 02:39:42,710
you want.
Like I just like NBC,

3566
02:39:42,711 --> 02:39:43,940
ABC,
CBS.

3567
02:39:43,941 --> 02:39:47,510
I have like a food network,
you know,

3568
02:39:47,570 --> 02:39:49,430
things like that.
It was like 40 channels,

3569
02:39:49,431 --> 02:39:51,380
you can get the best one.
It's playstation now.

3570
02:39:51,570 --> 02:39:53,840
Well there was um,
my friend had Alexa,

3571
02:39:54,110 --> 02:39:58,040
he has Amazon and that you talk to Alexa
and shuts the lights out and it does all

3572
02:39:58,041 --> 02:40:00,050
that weird shit.
But [inaudible] and uh,

3573
02:40:00,051 --> 02:40:02,450
he had a bunch of channels when I was 
looking at his stuff,

3574
02:40:02,451 --> 02:40:03,284
I had never been seen before and one of 
them was like all Montreal comedy 

3575
02:40:05,211 --> 02:40:06,044
festival.
It's like all people that I knew 

3576
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:09,890
performing in the Montreal comedy 
festival,

3577
02:40:09,891 --> 02:40:11,270
it's like this is weird.
Oh,

3578
02:40:11,600 --> 02:40:12,433
not Alexa.
You're talking about Amazon fire like 

3579
02:40:14,221 --> 02:40:14,490
that.

3580
02:40:14,490 --> 02:40:15,300
Yeah,
the box.

3581
02:40:15,300 --> 02:40:17,010
But he has Alexa,
like you talked to her.

3582
02:40:17,070 --> 02:40:18,060
Oh,
say Amazon.

3583
02:40:18,090 --> 02:40:19,890
You say Alexa,
please turn on the TV.

3584
02:40:19,891 --> 02:40:21,630
Alexa,
turn on channel five.

3585
02:40:21,660 --> 02:40:24,240
I have the Alexa that looks like a Mug,
you know that Alexa.

3586
02:40:25,290 --> 02:40:26,123
But my point being is that there's a 
bunch of channels and I never even knew 

3587
02:40:27,961 --> 02:40:30,690
existed that are on this essentially 
live TV.

3588
02:40:30,691 --> 02:40:31,524
They have programming.
So you're watching it just like you 

3589
02:40:33,511 --> 02:40:35,880
would watch direct TV.
Like if you were to watch directv now,

3590
02:40:36,090 --> 02:40:36,923
one channel becomes,
one show becomes the next show becomes 

3591
02:40:38,971 --> 02:40:41,030
the next show.
He just watched them in a series.

3592
02:40:41,060 --> 02:40:41,893
They play out in route.
They had this on these weird little 

3593
02:40:44,701 --> 02:40:45,421
channels.
And I'm like,

3594
02:40:45,421 --> 02:40:46,680
how many of these channels are there?
And he's like,

3595
02:40:46,681 --> 02:40:48,150
there's a lot of them and they're 
growing.

3596
02:40:48,570 --> 02:40:48,991
And I was like,
well,

3597
02:40:48,991 --> 02:40:51,690
this is television.
This is online television.

3598
02:40:51,690 --> 02:40:56,490
Like this isn't just like a Netflix show
where you tune in and then when you plus

3599
02:40:56,491 --> 02:40:57,840
play it starts.
No,

3600
02:40:57,841 --> 02:41:01,050
these things have a schedule.
Like this is on from seven to eight.

3601
02:41:01,051 --> 02:41:03,600
This is on from eight tonight.
It's fucking tv,

3602
02:41:03,810 --> 02:41:06,450
but it's online and it's streaming.
Like,

3603
02:41:06,451 --> 02:41:08,160
Whoa,
this is different.

3604
02:41:08,190 --> 02:41:09,810
Yeah,
there's a lot of those and a lot of them

3605
02:41:09,811 --> 02:41:10,644
have apps now,
so you can just download the app on the 

3606
02:41:12,480 --> 02:41:13,880
Apple TV.
Here's the problem.

3607
02:41:14,010 --> 02:41:17,910
What's so fucking great about direct TV?
What's so great about [inaudible]?

3608
02:41:18,050 --> 02:41:21,450
What's so great about their choices?
Like it's in terms of like entertainment

3609
02:41:21,451 --> 02:41:23,730
content,
how many white he's fucking go shows you

3610
02:41:23,790 --> 02:41:24,960
to put on,
you know,

3611
02:41:24,990 --> 02:41:26,130
oh,
another guy cooking.

3612
02:41:26,160 --> 02:41:27,620
Whoa.
Let me tune in now.

3613
02:41:27,720 --> 02:41:28,680
Oh look,
orders.

3614
02:41:28,890 --> 02:41:30,120
I've got a certain point in time.

3615
02:41:30,380 --> 02:41:31,520
Right.
Well,

3616
02:41:31,910 --> 02:41:32,743
uh,
I've been doing this too for like about 

3617
02:41:34,160 --> 02:41:34,600
a year.
I've been,

3618
02:41:34,600 --> 02:41:36,980
I cut my cut my cable channel.
Most of these,

3619
02:41:36,981 --> 02:41:37,814
cause I still want to watch live sports.
I still watch NBA Basketball Games are 

3620
02:41:39,811 --> 02:41:40,644
still a couple of football games.
I want to watch from time to time and 

3621
02:41:42,941 --> 02:41:43,774
though it'll freeze and at the worst 
time possible when the quarter's about 

3622
02:41:48,171 --> 02:41:49,910
to end or some really important so it's 
going to happen.

3623
02:41:49,911 --> 02:41:50,744
Or if you're watching the UFC fight,
you lose out minute of around in the 

3624
02:41:54,470 --> 02:41:56,840
middle of the third round of the last 
fight or something.

3625
02:41:56,841 --> 02:42:00,020
Like there's definitely bullshit or 
that's the difference on your directv or

3626
02:42:00,021 --> 02:42:02,440
at and t or time warner.
It's just a,

3627
02:42:02,900 --> 02:42:04,400
what we're used to.
It always comes in,

3628
02:42:04,401 --> 02:42:05,234
unless there's like a giant storm that 
cut everything out for the entire 

3629
02:42:07,730 --> 02:42:09,430
country or whatever,
it's all,

3630
02:42:09,540 --> 02:42:10,373
well always works

3631
02:42:10,420 --> 02:42:12,460
for now.
It's going to get better.

3632
02:42:12,490 --> 02:42:14,230
It's way better now than it was 10 years
ago.

3633
02:42:14,260 --> 02:42:16,570
Thinking about how bad it was when you 
first got online.

3634
02:42:16,600 --> 02:42:19,960
Real player got real everything,
everything.

3635
02:42:20,110 --> 02:42:21,880
Almost everything.
Anytime you watched a youtube video,

3636
02:42:21,881 --> 02:42:22,714
you had a pause and wait.
You were living in an era when it comes 

3637
02:42:25,841 --> 02:42:26,674
to the accessibility of stuff and as the
internet gets stronger and stronger to 

3638
02:42:29,651 --> 02:42:31,510
signals are getting better and better.
I mean,

3639
02:42:31,511 --> 02:42:34,300
we're on four g l t e now,
right?

3640
02:42:34,301 --> 02:42:35,950
Like what's,
what's five going to be like,

3641
02:42:35,951 --> 02:42:37,180
what's six?
What's seven?

3642
02:42:37,360 --> 02:42:38,440
How,
you know,

3643
02:42:38,441 --> 02:42:41,530
how powerful is that stuff going to be 
in terms of download speeds?

3644
02:42:42,060 --> 02:42:44,820
So when they get,
like when you hear like a 97% work,

3645
02:42:44,880 --> 02:42:45,713
everything works 97% of the time.
You don't want to be in that 3% of the 

3646
02:42:47,820 --> 02:42:48,720
time when it doesn't work.

3647
02:42:48,850 --> 02:42:49,683
Yeah.
Well I know a lot of people that get 

3648
02:42:50,711 --> 02:42:54,220
stitcher on their car,
it's like a native app on their car now.

3649
02:42:54,240 --> 02:42:56,890
And so they're listening to this podcast
right now on stitcher,

3650
02:42:56,891 --> 02:42:59,830
directly from their car and their car 
picks up the Internet.

3651
02:43:00,100 --> 02:43:01,480
Right.
Without having to plug your phone.

3652
02:43:01,481 --> 02:43:02,314
Yeah.
Like if you have a cadillac escalade 

3653
02:43:03,341 --> 02:43:04,174
when those new ones,
it comes to the builtin Internet 

3654
02:43:05,741 --> 02:43:07,890
connection.
So you're driving around,

3655
02:43:07,900 --> 02:43:10,540
you turn your fucking car into a wifi 
hub.

3656
02:43:10,580 --> 02:43:11,413
Yes.
We should be driving around like you 

3657
02:43:13,031 --> 02:43:18,031
could park and get on the Wifi of your 
fucking truck and I mean this is just,

3658
02:43:18,810 --> 02:43:19,643
you know,
step one of a million step process our 

3659
02:43:22,191 --> 02:43:24,050
phones at home then soon.
No,

3660
02:43:24,070 --> 02:43:24,880
no,
never.

3661
02:43:24,880 --> 02:43:26,440
Never.
Almost.

3662
02:43:26,470 --> 02:43:28,300
No.
Jamie's Jamie's fighting for it.

3663
02:43:28,360 --> 02:43:29,193
No,
you're going to have that chip in your 

3664
02:43:30,191 --> 02:43:32,470
head just like that Black Mirror show 
here.

3665
02:43:32,740 --> 02:43:35,890
That's what's going to happen.
It's amazing how close that Black Mirror

3666
02:43:35,891 --> 02:43:36,724
episode was to all these different 
versions of recording your memory that 

3667
02:43:40,721 --> 02:43:42,040
we had come up with.
Oh,

3668
02:43:42,070 --> 02:43:43,300
that's so funny.
It's going to happen.

3669
02:43:43,340 --> 02:43:46,420
So funny you said that because that's 
definitely what I thought.

3670
02:43:46,450 --> 02:43:48,260
I thought every single episodes like 
there,

3671
02:43:48,310 --> 02:43:50,530
they're listening to jre no,
no,

3672
02:43:50,531 --> 02:43:50,891
no,
no.

3673
02:43:50,891 --> 02:43:51,724
Those,
no.

3674
02:43:51,760 --> 02:43:52,593
I think way more likely is that those 
subjects are being repeated by a bunch 

3675
02:43:56,951 --> 02:44:00,310
of curious people all over the world.
Like the ability to record memory.

3676
02:44:00,311 --> 02:44:03,160
Everybody knows that's comment and their
take on it was really pretty unique.

3677
02:44:03,490 --> 02:44:04,323
But like all the different,
all the different possibilities that 

3678
02:44:07,121 --> 02:44:07,954
we've ever discussed on this podcast,
there's a lot of other people talking 

3679
02:44:10,601 --> 02:44:12,040
about them.
It's not just us.

3680
02:44:12,220 --> 02:44:15,970
There's a million different people 
speculating as to where the fuck is this

3681
02:44:15,971 --> 02:44:16,804
all going and virtual reality and 
particularly like there's not a single 

3682
02:44:19,811 --> 02:44:24,380
person that could say I'm the only one 
who's predicted the,

3683
02:44:24,381 --> 02:44:24,821
the,
you know,

3684
02:44:24,821 --> 02:44:26,290
the future of virtual reality.

3685
02:44:26,290 --> 02:44:29,020
Like if you were talking about virtual 
reality for sure you got it from me,

3686
02:44:29,710 --> 02:44:32,680
that's impossible.
There's millions of people that have had

3687
02:44:32,681 --> 02:44:35,950
like pretty profound thoughts about the 
potential for virtual reality.

3688
02:44:36,060 --> 02:44:37,440
No,
it's just that if you,

3689
02:44:37,460 --> 02:44:38,293
the watch the whole season,
it seems like every episode is like a 

3690
02:44:39,851 --> 02:44:41,320
different thing that you've talked 
about.

3691
02:44:41,590 --> 02:44:43,240
Like remember when we said a long time 
ago,

3692
02:44:43,260 --> 02:44:46,010
uh,
how I thought like likes are going to be

3693
02:44:46,030 --> 02:44:48,010
currency and stuff like that in the 
future.

3694
02:44:48,220 --> 02:44:49,820
They have a whole episode about that 
that gets,

3695
02:44:49,930 --> 02:44:51,820
so when other people have thought that 
to make sure,

3696
02:44:52,450 --> 02:44:53,283
I was talking about a yelp review for 
people like a long fucking time ago 

3697
02:44:57,761 --> 02:45:00,340
about like people having floating stars 
above their head.

3698
02:45:00,341 --> 02:45:01,600
Like when you walk into them you go,
oh,

3699
02:45:01,601 --> 02:45:03,310
this guy's got four stars.
Must be a cool dude.

3700
02:45:03,580 --> 02:45:05,210
I call,
he bought his fucking stars.

3701
02:45:05,210 --> 02:45:07,120
And you find out people are buying their
stars like you.

3702
02:45:07,630 --> 02:45:08,463
Like if you find that if you go to a 
yelp review and it's like a Vietnam 

3703
02:45:10,661 --> 02:45:13,660
restaurant and all the fucking reviews 
are in broken English,

3704
02:45:13,840 --> 02:45:17,860
best noodle ever have you and no for me,
this is my place.

3705
02:45:17,890 --> 02:45:19,570
Exclamation point,
exclamation point.

3706
02:45:19,580 --> 02:45:22,660
In the same way,
like the same like shitty broken English

3707
02:45:22,661 --> 02:45:23,494
and every review you'd be like,
I think these motherfuckers are writing 

3708
02:45:25,180 --> 02:45:26,560
their own reviews.
Right.

3709
02:45:26,860 --> 02:45:27,693
But if you've ever gone like a yelp 
review or any kind of review for 

3710
02:45:30,611 --> 02:45:33,310
something and you know the people 
probably bought those reviews.

3711
02:45:33,430 --> 02:45:35,350
Absolutely.
You can tell he grossed out,

3712
02:45:35,380 --> 02:45:35,861
right?
Yeah.

3713
02:45:35,861 --> 02:45:36,694
They have no other review.
No other reviews except that the people 

3714
02:45:40,871 --> 02:45:41,704
that if you go to their instagram page,
they got a million followers and like 

3715
02:45:44,111 --> 02:45:47,590
last week they had 300,000
or 30,000

3716
02:45:47,760 --> 02:45:48,593
like what happened?
Were you involved in a national scandal 

3717
02:45:50,230 --> 02:45:54,070
or he could buy instagram followers 
easily and twitter followers.

3718
02:45:54,100 --> 02:45:55,240
Instagram is a big one though,
right?

3719
02:45:55,270 --> 02:45:56,103
Yeah,
I know a lot of instagram girls who 

3720
02:45:58,030 --> 02:46:01,090
bought followers.
They're public about it though.

3721
02:46:01,120 --> 02:46:01,721
They're like,
yeah,

3722
02:46:01,721 --> 02:46:02,554
it's just so I can get more stuff.
The sports commentator got caught 

3723
02:46:05,530 --> 02:46:10,530
leaving a comment on his own page.
Oh

3724
02:46:10,850 --> 02:46:11,740
No.

3725
02:46:11,860 --> 02:46:13,410
Uh,

3726
02:46:14,810 --> 02:46:15,710
great.
See that?

3727
02:46:17,800 --> 02:46:19,700
Ha Funny.
Skip bayless thought.

3728
02:46:20,120 --> 02:46:20,953
Forgot to switch accounts.
Praising himself on a facebook 

3729
02:46:23,691 --> 02:46:24,524
livestream.

3730
02:46:26,080 --> 02:46:30,340
It may not have actually been ham 
because it could've been someone working

3731
02:46:30,341 --> 02:46:31,174
for him.
He doesn't talk to anybody working for 

3732
02:46:32,381 --> 02:46:33,790
him.
It's him like his wife or something.

3733
02:46:33,820 --> 02:46:34,653
No,
it's him.

3734
02:46:34,990 --> 02:46:37,510
You are the man.
Exclamation point,

3735
02:46:37,511 --> 02:46:38,500
exclamation show.
Fuck.

3736
02:46:38,501 --> 02:46:42,100
To get caught doing that.
To love the new show on fs,

3737
02:46:42,101 --> 02:46:44,650
one exclamation point,
exclamation point.

3738
02:46:44,651 --> 02:46:46,840
Explanation.
Oh my God.

3739
02:46:47,350 --> 02:46:49,000
Did he try to delete it?
I don't know.

3740
02:46:49,080 --> 02:46:49,970
Shit.
He,

3741
02:46:50,340 --> 02:46:52,330
it,
they be like fell down and hit his head.

3742
02:46:53,200 --> 02:46:54,530
Was that,
I hope,

3743
02:46:54,770 --> 02:46:58,900
I hope this is a joke.
It's a comedian revealing himself at the

3744
02:46:58,901 --> 02:47:02,530
Ice House comedy club on the facebook.
Like if you go to the ice house stuff.

3745
02:47:02,770 --> 02:47:04,210
Yeah.
Like it's under his account.

3746
02:47:04,211 --> 02:47:08,510
Like I saw so and so their privilege 
seeing him so funny by Mertz.

3747
02:47:11,130 --> 02:47:13,720
Who is it?
He's someone you know,

3748
02:47:14,310 --> 02:47:16,780
he always starts a great party.
Do you know him?

3749
02:47:16,900 --> 02:47:18,010
Yeah,
we all know.

3750
02:47:20,300 --> 02:47:21,770
Oh no,
but,

3751
02:47:22,060 --> 02:47:23,700
but he's not the only one.
He's not,

3752
02:47:23,710 --> 02:47:25,900
he's not the only one.
There's a lot of Comedians,

3753
02:47:26,320 --> 02:47:29,170
so I don't know if that's like a joke 
or,

3754
02:47:29,270 --> 02:47:30,103
um,
well some people don't understand 

3755
02:47:31,470 --> 02:47:32,303
retweets and the copy and paste stuff 
and they forget to put a rt in front of 

3756
02:47:36,351 --> 02:47:37,850
it.
But even so,

3757
02:47:38,620 --> 02:47:39,790
yeah,
people have been busted before.

3758
02:47:39,791 --> 02:47:44,470
They get like a publicist will send out 
a big message to like 20 celebrities and

3759
02:47:44,471 --> 02:47:45,304
they'll just copy and paste the whole 
thing and forgot to change the two 

3760
02:47:47,561 --> 02:47:49,450
things they're supposed to change to 
make it seem,

3761
02:47:49,570 --> 02:47:50,890
oh yeah.
Original.

3762
02:47:50,990 --> 02:47:52,940
Yeah.
Well there's definitely that.

3763
02:47:53,030 --> 02:47:53,863
Definitely people who have done that and
there's also the limitations of 140 

3764
02:47:56,301 --> 02:47:57,134
characters,
so sometimes maybe like won't attribute 

3765
02:47:59,271 --> 02:48:00,830
it to somebody that somebody else said 
it.

3766
02:48:01,190 --> 02:48:03,020
You fuck up and then you go,
what did I just do?

3767
02:48:03,650 --> 02:48:06,110
I don't know who that guy is.
Is he a big time guy?

3768
02:48:06,210 --> 02:48:07,320
That guy that yeah.
Yeah,

3769
02:48:07,330 --> 02:48:08,860
yeah.
Really get bayless.

3770
02:48:08,980 --> 02:48:09,501
Really?
Yeah,

3771
02:48:09,501 --> 02:48:11,600
he's the first take.
He used to be on espn,

3772
02:48:11,601 --> 02:48:13,840
now he's on Fox sports.
Oh,

3773
02:48:13,850 --> 02:48:15,350
just talk shit.
Talk Shit.

3774
02:48:16,590 --> 02:48:21,590
Really Weird fucking take on Ronda 
Rousey in the last fs one thing,

3775
02:48:23,310 --> 02:48:26,370
the last Fox thing and I remember 
watching that going,

3776
02:48:26,460 --> 02:48:28,920
this guy should shut the fuck up.

3777
02:48:29,790 --> 02:48:32,720
Just trying to say anything you can to 
get attention on a day to day basis.

3778
02:48:33,330 --> 02:48:33,600
Not

3779
02:48:33,600 --> 02:48:34,680
really.
They should shut the fuck up.

3780
02:48:34,681 --> 02:48:35,880
He's talking if he wants to,
but I,

3781
02:48:35,890 --> 02:48:36,723
I was,
I felt like you didn't know what he's 

3782
02:48:37,531 --> 02:48:40,830
talking about.
I felt it come through.

3783
02:48:41,250 --> 02:48:42,083
I was like listening to him talk about 
it and kind of made it kind of good 

3784
02:48:44,731 --> 02:48:47,250
point about,
I think he was talking about her.

3785
02:48:47,251 --> 02:48:52,251
I'm taking the time off and all this 
stuff and I don't think he knows a sport

3786
02:48:53,131 --> 02:48:54,840
that well,
I might be wrong.

3787
02:48:54,970 --> 02:48:56,190
I don't think so.
I might,

3788
02:48:56,260 --> 02:48:57,780
I might be wrong,
I might be wrong,

3789
02:48:57,781 --> 02:48:58,614
but it just didn't,
it seemed to me like one of those clear 

3790
02:49:01,411 --> 02:49:06,411
examples of the main stream adopting,
like I take

3791
02:49:08,130 --> 02:49:10,590
on something that they don't follow all 
that closely.

3792
02:49:10,591 --> 02:49:12,900
Like a lot of people love to be right 
about fighting.

3793
02:49:13,200 --> 02:49:14,370
It's a big one,
man.

3794
02:49:14,640 --> 02:49:16,350
They love to be right about who's gonna 
win,

3795
02:49:16,351 --> 02:49:18,270
who's gonna lose.
It's one of the reasons why I don't,

3796
02:49:18,271 --> 02:49:21,390
I hardly ever give predictions.
So you don't know shit.

3797
02:49:21,870 --> 02:49:23,430
You don't know what the fuck's going to 
happen.

3798
02:49:23,670 --> 02:49:25,770
You could tell me you think you know 
what's going to happen.

3799
02:49:25,771 --> 02:49:29,790
But until those people go in there and 
fucking throw punches at each other,

3800
02:49:29,791 --> 02:49:34,510
anything can happen.
Anything come on mayweather that,

3801
02:49:34,620 --> 02:49:38,280
that highly unlikely to happen.
But if it did happen,

3802
02:49:38,400 --> 02:49:39,233
if they would just boxed,
probably like the biggest boxing match 

3803
02:49:41,431 --> 02:49:42,620
of all time.
Uh,

3804
02:49:42,870 --> 02:49:46,680
Nate said he wants 20 million or he's 
not talking or something like that.

3805
02:49:46,681 --> 02:49:47,514
He might've been high,
might have been high as fuck when he 

3806
02:49:49,951 --> 02:49:50,784
said that.

3807
02:49:52,240 --> 02:49:53,073
Great Dude.
I've been hanging out with that like he 

3808
02:49:54,471 --> 02:49:57,000
could put into coming to the comedy 
store in a regular basis.

3809
02:49:57,001 --> 02:49:58,620
Now I've been hanging out with him late 
night.

3810
02:49:58,700 --> 02:50:00,040
Yeah,
I was hanging out with him and Nixon.

3811
02:50:00,650 --> 02:50:01,800
Nick's great.
Yeah.

3812
02:50:02,280 --> 02:50:03,570
Funny dudes.
You would never know.

3813
02:50:03,571 --> 02:50:05,380
They could beat the fuck out of here.
He's just meet them.

3814
02:50:05,381 --> 02:50:07,160
You think they're so friendly.
It's,

3815
02:50:07,210 --> 02:50:09,030
you know,
just normal dudes,

3816
02:50:09,820 --> 02:50:14,160
you know.
It's fucking brutal sport man.

3817
02:50:14,190 --> 02:50:16,110
He deserves 20 million bucks.
They all do.

3818
02:50:16,280 --> 02:50:18,840
You just did Tony's podcast too.
I heard her.

3819
02:50:18,841 --> 02:50:19,750
It was really good.
Yeah.

3820
02:50:20,100 --> 02:50:21,510
I just think it's weird,
man.

3821
02:50:21,511 --> 02:50:24,270
When people who start chiming in about 
the sport,

3822
02:50:24,271 --> 02:50:26,190
they do it like they talk about other 
sports.

3823
02:50:26,850 --> 02:50:29,700
To me it seems so much more personal.
Like,

3824
02:50:30,660 --> 02:50:33,610
fuck man,
I've been following it forever and I,

3825
02:50:33,640 --> 02:50:34,473
I barely have the confidence to say what
I think is going to happen when people 

3826
02:50:36,901 --> 02:50:37,734
fight.

3827
02:50:37,920 --> 02:50:38,753
So when I,
when I see people just jump in and have 

3828
02:50:41,221 --> 02:50:42,450
an opinion of it,
it's like,

3829
02:50:42,600 --> 02:50:43,433
Oh man,
I guess,

3830
02:50:43,690 --> 02:50:44,171
yeah,
go ahead.

3831
02:50:44,171 --> 02:50:45,004
Man,
they're trying to get all controversial 

3832
02:50:46,381 --> 02:50:48,330
about stuff he's trying to,
I've,

3833
02:50:48,390 --> 02:50:50,010
uh,
I played basketball in high school,

3834
02:50:50,011 --> 02:50:50,844
but I still like,
I watched it for my whole life and I 

3835
02:50:52,321 --> 02:50:54,510
hear someone say something stupid like 
at the gym,

3836
02:50:54,960 --> 02:50:57,210
just about like Lebron or the warrior.
And I'm like,

3837
02:50:57,220 --> 02:50:58,053
shut the fuck out of here.
You don't know what you're talking 

3838
02:51:00,511 --> 02:51:01,680
about.
My basketball.

3839
02:51:01,710 --> 02:51:02,543
Well,
it's also,

3840
02:51:02,550 --> 02:51:03,383
here's another thing,
one of the things about mma is that the 

3841
02:51:05,881 --> 02:51:07,920
sport is as,
I mean,

3842
02:51:07,921 --> 02:51:08,754
I hate that fucking Cliche,
but I've got to use it as real as it 

3843
02:51:10,471 --> 02:51:12,720
gets.
It doesn't get any more real in terms of

3844
02:51:12,721 --> 02:51:17,721
like raw emotion and consequence.
So as a show,

3845
02:51:20,820 --> 02:51:25,680
when you're watching it on television,
I don't know if you're getting a 100% of

3846
02:51:25,681 --> 02:51:26,880
that,
if you're there,

3847
02:51:26,881 --> 02:51:28,050
I think you get more of it.

3848
02:51:28,650 --> 02:51:31,370
But it's,
what it is,

3849
02:51:31,371 --> 02:51:32,204
is,
is it's so raw and so real that if 

3850
02:51:34,771 --> 02:51:37,200
someone's not real and they're talking 
about it,

3851
02:51:37,920 --> 02:51:39,870
it becomes real obvious.
Like,

3852
02:51:39,871 --> 02:51:42,570
if you don't really care,
like if you're talking about a fight and

3853
02:51:42,571 --> 02:51:47,571
you're getting all jazzed up about it,
if you're,

3854
02:51:48,091 --> 02:51:48,924
um,
if you're talking about a fight and you 

3855
02:51:50,941 --> 02:51:52,920
get jack,
if you actually are jazzed up about it,

3856
02:51:52,921 --> 02:51:54,840
people can feel that.
But if you're faking it,

3857
02:51:55,230 --> 02:51:58,830
they feel that too man.
And in this sport,

3858
02:51:58,831 --> 02:52:02,220
because the sport is so,
and it's so intensely real,

3859
02:52:02,221 --> 02:52:06,070
it's so intensely raw and naked that

3860
02:52:06,070 --> 02:52:06,903
you,
um,

3861
02:52:07,210 --> 02:52:09,850
your la people are way,
way less tolerant to bull.

3862
02:52:09,851 --> 02:52:12,580
I'm good dude.
Way less tolerant of bullshit,

3863
02:52:13,540 --> 02:52:15,250
you know,
or things they disagree with.

3864
02:52:15,251 --> 02:52:16,084
It's like there's a lot of,
a lot riding on every aspect of 

3865
02:52:20,561 --> 02:52:21,394
fighting.
Like you see the Bernard Hopkins Fight 

3866
02:52:23,740 --> 02:52:24,573
Sad,
right?

3867
02:52:24,730 --> 02:52:26,890
That was sad.
Bernard Hopkins,

3868
02:52:26,891 --> 02:52:31,060
if 51 years old fought this kid named 
Joe Smith Jr if you're,

3869
02:52:31,370 --> 02:52:33,700
if nobody's seen Joe Smith junior before
he's fucking,

3870
02:52:33,730 --> 02:52:37,240
he's a killer.
Like Bernard Hopkins picked a killer and

3871
02:52:37,241 --> 02:52:40,360
this kid fucked him up and his kid has 
extra long arms.

3872
02:52:40,420 --> 02:52:43,540
He's got weird arms,
like his arms go below his waist.

3873
02:52:44,560 --> 02:52:45,730
I was watching him fight.
It was like,

3874
02:52:45,731 --> 02:52:48,880
look at the length of his fucking arms.
Like he just,

3875
02:52:49,060 --> 02:52:49,893
he beat the shit out of Bernard and he 
knocked him out of the ring and Bernard 

3876
02:52:52,121 --> 02:52:54,970
caught him with some good shots.
He was timing him and he caught him with

3877
02:52:54,971 --> 02:52:57,670
a few right hands with the kid was just 
eating them and moving forward.

3878
02:52:57,670 --> 02:53:00,460
And you know what it looks like.
It's like when people have fake hands,

3879
02:53:00,490 --> 02:53:03,480
like the fake hand is like sticking 
through the shirt sleeve.

3880
02:53:04,120 --> 02:53:06,100
Yeah.
He almost looked like a cartoon guy with

3881
02:53:06,101 --> 02:53:08,450
his extra long arms but he's a bad 
motherfucker.

3882
02:53:08,480 --> 02:53:12,460
That guy and Bernard got knocked through
the ropes and fell on his head.

3883
02:53:12,820 --> 02:53:16,000
It was crazy to watch and he got up,
he was all disoriented,

3884
02:53:16,030 --> 02:53:18,310
didn't know what happened,
thought he was pushed through the ropes,

3885
02:53:18,311 --> 02:53:19,144
but he was punched through the ropes 
that got connected with like four or 

3886
02:53:22,241 --> 02:53:23,074
five big shots and,
and the last one was a left hook on the 

3887
02:53:26,651 --> 02:53:27,484
face as Bernard was going through the 
ropes and it knocked him all the way 

3888
02:53:30,821 --> 02:53:33,430
through,
but it was 100% legal.

3889
02:53:33,580 --> 02:53:35,800
He didn't do anything wrong.
He did everything with punches.

3890
02:53:35,830 --> 02:53:37,000
It would,
none of it was a push.

3891
02:53:37,210 --> 02:53:40,240
He was just bombing on them and it just 
was a freak incident.

3892
02:53:40,240 --> 02:53:42,870
It's one of the reasons why cages are so
much better than a ring.

3893
02:53:43,450 --> 02:53:46,000
A cage is so superior,
like a ring.

3894
02:53:46,001 --> 02:53:46,960
It's like that,
that,

3895
02:53:46,990 --> 02:53:49,300
that possibility that you could fall 
through like that.

3896
02:53:49,330 --> 02:53:51,250
That's terrible.
That should,

3897
02:53:51,251 --> 02:53:54,550
they should stop using rings and if they
do use rings,

3898
02:53:54,670 --> 02:53:56,860
they should pad the shit out of the 
outside area.

3899
02:53:56,861 --> 02:53:57,694
The fact that someone like Bernard 
Hopkins who's been boxing for forever 

3900
02:54:00,940 --> 02:54:01,773
can still get knocked through a rope 
like that and land on his head that 

3901
02:54:04,961 --> 02:54:08,110
that's a possibility.
That's a stupid way of containing people

3902
02:54:08,770 --> 02:54:11,650
they should have instead of ropes like 
that would,

3903
02:54:11,651 --> 02:54:12,484
they should have is something that has a
criss cross pattern where you can't go 

3904
02:54:15,101 --> 02:54:18,940
through it and you should have to just 
climb over it to get in it.

3905
02:54:18,941 --> 02:54:22,120
It should be real simple and it should 
be a way that they could release the,

3906
02:54:22,121 --> 02:54:23,050
uh,
the ropes.

3907
02:54:23,140 --> 02:54:25,150
Like if there was a medical emergency at
the end of the fight,

3908
02:54:25,151 --> 02:54:25,984
it should be like a latch.
They could pull and drop the ribs down 

3909
02:54:27,761 --> 02:54:30,310
and get somebody out.
But the ropes,

3910
02:54:30,311 --> 02:54:32,140
the way they use them now in boxing 
matches,

3911
02:54:32,141 --> 02:54:32,974
they should fucking outlaw those.
The fact that Bernard Hopkins can get 

3912
02:54:36,191 --> 02:54:38,330
knocked through one like that.
That's cool.

3913
02:54:38,380 --> 02:54:40,840
Or the very least.
You've got to protect the outside area.

3914
02:54:41,050 --> 02:54:43,210
You got to pad the shit out of it and 
you had to have,

3915
02:54:43,300 --> 02:54:47,740
he should have people around and most of
the time a thousand fights in a row.

3916
02:54:47,741 --> 02:54:49,780
It's probably never going to come into 
play,

3917
02:54:49,930 --> 02:54:50,763
but the onetime it does.
You're responsible for that guy falling 

3918
02:54:53,111 --> 02:54:54,790
through the ropes.
That's fucking stupid.

3919
02:54:55,150 --> 02:54:55,983
Like look at him.
He goes flying through men look a 

3920
02:54:58,031 --> 02:54:58,864
little,
lengthen that kids' arms so it doesn't 

3921
02:55:00,281 --> 02:55:01,114
look,
it looks photoshop like his head is not 

3922
02:55:02,081 --> 02:55:03,200
the right size or something.

3923
02:55:03,260 --> 02:55:04,490
He's a,
he's built for it.

3924
02:55:04,491 --> 02:55:07,550
I'll tell you that.
He's got great genetics and works hard.

3925
02:55:07,551 --> 02:55:09,050
Tough kid.
Really good fighter.

3926
02:55:09,080 --> 02:55:11,300
Had Chin line if you like that,
huh?

3927
02:55:11,840 --> 02:55:12,740
Yeah.
He's an animal.

3928
02:55:13,320 --> 02:55:14,153
I was,
I was super impressed with his poise to 

3929
02:55:15,681 --> 02:55:17,490
in fighting a guy like Bernard Hopkins,
man,

3930
02:55:17,500 --> 02:55:18,333
that guy stepped up in a big way and he 
was a two to one underdog leaning into 

3931
02:55:22,191 --> 02:55:23,780
that fight,
which is really crazy.

3932
02:55:24,400 --> 02:55:26,810
What's APP?
Yeah.

3933
02:55:27,070 --> 02:55:28,640
Yeah.
I was pretty convinced that,

3934
02:55:28,641 --> 02:55:29,474
uh,
Bernard was going to be able to stifle 

3935
02:55:31,581 --> 02:55:35,450
him and turn it into like the kind of 
fight that Bernard likes,

3936
02:55:35,690 --> 02:55:37,370
but I wasn't sure if Bernard could win.
You know,

3937
02:55:37,371 --> 02:55:40,370
it's a long time off,
two years when you're 51 years old.

3938
02:55:40,400 --> 02:55:43,190
It's a long time off.
He still fought amazing.

3939
02:55:43,820 --> 02:55:45,440
But at the end of the day,
that kid marked him.

3940
02:55:46,220 --> 02:55:48,590
He just was,
he was just too much and he was,

3941
02:55:48,620 --> 02:55:49,453
he's,
he's a guy that would have been a real 

3942
02:55:50,901 --> 02:55:54,230
threat at any time in anyone's career.

3943
02:55:54,500 --> 02:55:55,333
Like he's,
this kid has real talent and right now 

3944
02:55:57,621 --> 02:55:58,454
he's not thought of as being the best 
fighter in the world or anything even 

3945
02:56:00,261 --> 02:56:03,260
close to like that.
But Bernard was at one point in time,

3946
02:56:03,261 --> 02:56:05,150
Bernard,
like when he beat Felix Trinidad,

3947
02:56:05,540 --> 02:56:06,373
a lot of people were saying that might 
be the best pound for pound box or the 

3948
02:56:08,721 --> 02:56:09,554
earth.
Like a lot of people thought Trinidad 

3949
02:56:10,491 --> 02:56:13,580
was going to beat him.
He fucked Trinidad up and then he fought

3950
02:56:13,581 --> 02:56:17,000
Kelly pavlick and a lot of people wrote 
him off against Kelly Pavlik.

3951
02:56:17,270 --> 02:56:22,070
He box the shit out of Kelly Pavlick.
And so you look at like Bernard's legacy

3952
02:56:22,071 --> 02:56:22,521
and you go,
man,

3953
02:56:22,521 --> 02:56:27,521
this is an unbelievably skillful guy.
But at any point in that career that Joe

3954
02:56:28,010 --> 02:56:30,110
Kelly kid would have been a handful.
He's just scary.

3955
02:56:30,400 --> 02:56:31,233
He's or Joe Smith rather that Joe Smith 
junior kid would have been a handful 

3956
02:56:34,401 --> 02:56:35,960
because he's just fucking scary.

3957
02:56:36,630 --> 02:56:41,090
He hits hard and he's,
he's super accurate and he's got awesome

3958
02:56:41,091 --> 02:56:41,924
endurance and a great work ethic.
He's fucking dangerous no matter what 

3959
02:56:44,780 --> 02:56:46,520
era it is.
And Bernard,

3960
02:56:46,850 --> 02:56:47,683
you know,
maybe Bernard would have been able to 

3961
02:56:48,351 --> 02:56:50,510
beat him in his,
in his prime.

3962
02:56:50,690 --> 02:56:52,460
You know,
it's totally possible.

3963
02:56:53,120 --> 02:56:56,000
It's 100% likely.
I mean Bernard's and all time.

3964
02:56:56,001 --> 02:56:56,834
Great.
Maybe it would have been able to land 

3965
02:56:57,801 --> 02:56:59,570
more of the punches that he landed in 
that fight.

3966
02:56:59,870 --> 02:57:03,620
But you don't know.
I mean that kids dangerous boxing such a

3967
02:57:03,621 --> 02:57:06,650
crazy sport.
It's,

3968
02:57:06,830 --> 02:57:07,663
it's weird that it's a,
we all know now that it's so bad for 

3969
02:57:11,421 --> 02:57:13,760
you,
it's so bad for your brain.

3970
02:57:14,210 --> 02:57:15,980
Like the practice of it,
the,

3971
02:57:16,130 --> 02:57:18,770
the doing it.
We know it's terrible for you,

3972
02:57:18,771 --> 02:57:22,430
but we still watch just like football,
just like I'm in May.

3973
02:57:23,660 --> 02:57:25,660
We know,
but,

3974
02:57:25,740 --> 02:57:26,573
well,
I think there's going to make training 

3975
02:57:27,411 --> 02:57:29,360
smarter because I don't think the 
fighting is going ever end.

3976
02:57:30,470 --> 02:57:33,500
Cause we like p some people don't train 
smarter though.

3977
02:57:33,710 --> 02:57:36,590
You could train anyway you want.
That's the problem.

3978
02:57:36,591 --> 02:57:37,424
Nobody knows who's right.
Like Eddie Alvarez sparred like a 

3979
02:57:39,231 --> 02:57:41,430
hundred rounds,
um,

3980
02:57:41,510 --> 02:57:42,343
in preparation for his fight against 
Hofeld Osan Joseph sparred like a shit 

3981
02:57:45,361 --> 02:57:48,020
load and came out looking like a 
monster.

3982
02:57:48,080 --> 02:57:49,670
Just,
just stormed.

3983
02:57:49,671 --> 02:57:51,170
Dosantos knocked him out in the first 
round.

3984
02:57:51,890 --> 02:57:54,200
But then connor,
you know,

3985
02:57:54,260 --> 02:57:57,680
connor doesn't his bar that much.
It doesn't spoil like that.

3986
02:57:57,681 --> 02:57:58,514
Like the way Alvarez was doing it.
And some guys aren't like Donald's 

3987
02:58:00,341 --> 02:58:01,800
Sarone.
He's not sparring at all.

3988
02:58:02,640 --> 02:58:06,180
Donald cerrone's just doing drills and 
he looks better than ever.

3989
02:58:06,690 --> 02:58:08,280
I mean,
he just fucking head kicked.

3990
02:58:08,281 --> 02:58:09,114
Mack Mack Brown.
No one's ever knocked out Matt Brown 

3991
02:58:11,461 --> 02:58:12,360
like that.
I mean,

3992
02:58:12,361 --> 02:58:14,300
people have stopped him.
You know,

3993
02:58:14,310 --> 02:58:15,143
Jake Ellenberger is the only one that 
ever stopped him and he stopped him in 

3994
02:58:16,521 --> 02:58:19,660
the shot to the body.
How the anybody else before that?

3995
02:58:19,661 --> 02:58:22,470
It's stopped him with body shots.
They've heard them.

3996
02:58:23,580 --> 02:58:25,620
But this is like a beating,
you know,

3997
02:58:25,621 --> 02:58:28,080
and Donald Donald Head kicked him 
unconscious.

3998
02:58:28,081 --> 02:58:28,531
I mean,
that was,

3999
02:58:28,531 --> 02:58:33,150
that's like as final of victory as it 
gets.

4000
02:58:33,540 --> 02:58:36,120
And he's not even sparring.
He says he feels way better now,

4001
02:58:36,120 --> 02:58:36,260
I think

4002
02:58:36,260 --> 02:58:37,310
as a veteran,
excuse me,

4003
02:58:37,311 --> 02:58:39,470
as veteran as it comes to like a new guy
coming in,

4004
02:58:39,620 --> 02:58:41,660
that doesn't sound like you shouldn't be
sparring.

4005
02:58:41,661 --> 02:58:42,494
You should probably be sparring a little
bit to the whole key is to get somebody 

4006
02:58:45,021 --> 02:58:47,210
who spars with you that's not trying to 
hurt you,

4007
02:58:47,390 --> 02:58:49,220
but it's just trying to grow with you 
and learn.

4008
02:58:49,490 --> 02:58:51,950
That's so hard because egos get involved
late.

4009
02:58:51,951 --> 02:58:55,040
George would never hurt you.
What?

4010
02:58:55,580 --> 02:58:56,091
Boy?
George.

4011
02:58:56,091 --> 02:58:57,350
Who would never heard you?
Oh,

4012
02:59:00,100 --> 02:59:01,010
all right.
That's it.

4013
02:59:02,050 --> 02:59:04,370
Sorry.
What else are we going to go?

4014
02:59:04,760 --> 02:59:09,470
I didn't know we were that deep.
What's it's four 30 oh it's almost tried

4015
02:59:09,471 --> 02:59:11,230
to breyer.
Oh my God.

4016
02:59:11,250 --> 02:59:13,020
It's going to suck.
Well,

4017
02:59:13,021 --> 02:59:15,170
this is,
it's the only time you can drive,

4018
02:59:15,171 --> 02:59:16,460
right?
Like you have a seven o'clock show.

4019
02:59:16,461 --> 02:59:19,170
You literally have to leave now.
How crazy is there?

4020
02:59:19,700 --> 02:59:21,320
Do you take 'em you know you should 
take,

4021
02:59:21,350 --> 02:59:23,640
you should take the two 10 to go.

4022
02:59:23,640 --> 02:59:25,370
I went 34 to 10 and then go,
yeah,

4023
02:59:25,430 --> 02:59:27,440
well you can go up to one 18 you can go 
shoot,

4024
02:59:27,920 --> 02:59:28,753
go down to Topanga.
Took the Panga to the one 18 tick the 

4025
02:59:31,461 --> 02:59:34,310
one 18 to the to 10 you'll go,
it will take you more miles.

4026
02:59:34,670 --> 02:59:37,520
But then you dropped down instead of 
going through this shit.

4027
02:59:37,580 --> 02:59:39,500
Right?
Like if you go through that four or five

4028
02:59:39,530 --> 02:59:41,450
like this time of the day,
I wouldn't do that.

4029
02:59:41,990 --> 02:59:44,570
Or the five either one of those can suck
a fat one.

4030
02:59:44,590 --> 02:59:46,630
Yeah,
the five just ridiculous.

4031
02:59:46,631 --> 02:59:49,550
Five is always under construction.
Isn't it funny how we have people in the

4032
02:59:49,551 --> 02:59:53,070
La talk talk like this though,
like about highways and yeah.

4033
02:59:53,240 --> 02:59:56,870
It doesn't happen like that in Ohio or 
well they don't have as many people.

4034
02:59:56,890 --> 02:59:58,340
Right.
We've fucked up.

4035
02:59:58,520 --> 02:59:59,353
This is a great spot.
Too many people found out and they all 

4036
03:00:01,461 --> 03:00:02,294
just moved here.

4037
03:00:02,450 --> 03:00:03,283
There's way too many people here.
I kind of looked us up one day to the 

4038
03:00:05,780 --> 03:00:08,120
freeways here where all,
they weren't always called numbers.

4039
03:00:08,121 --> 03:00:11,150
They were called like this was like the 
Ventura freeway in the Hollywood highway

4040
03:00:11,151 --> 03:00:11,984
and shit like that.
And then so they changed the names and 

4041
03:00:13,131 --> 03:00:13,964
people just drop what they used to call 
them and just call the one on one de 

4042
03:00:16,501 --> 03:00:18,740
four oh five no one 18.
That's only out here,

4043
03:00:18,741 --> 03:00:19,574
you know,
cause it's not that many different 

4044
03:00:20,511 --> 03:00:22,970
freeways and other places really either.
But um,

4045
03:00:23,030 --> 03:00:27,640
even if you go somewhere you would like 
in Massachusetts you'd say you a,

4046
03:00:27,650 --> 03:00:30,050
you get on four or five south,
you know,

4047
03:00:30,051 --> 03:00:31,790
you wouldn't say it's about four or 
five.

4048
03:00:31,791 --> 03:00:33,740
Yeah.
That's what I mean by the was only added

4049
03:00:33,741 --> 03:00:36,080
because they didn't refer the freeways 
here as number.

4050
03:00:36,081 --> 03:00:40,430
Is this the one that one was only the 
Ventura freeway or a highway or whatever

4051
03:00:40,431 --> 03:00:40,840
the fuck?
Well,

4052
03:00:40,840 --> 03:00:43,040
that was the case in Boston with the 
mass turnpike.

4053
03:00:43,310 --> 03:00:45,590
Like the mass turnpike was called the 
mass turnpike,

4054
03:00:45,591 --> 03:00:48,230
but it also had a number,
like you look on a map.

4055
03:00:48,260 --> 03:00:50,240
It would be the number and then the mass
turnpike,

4056
03:00:50,241 --> 03:00:53,390
like what does this thing,
it's like it's got a royal distinction.

4057
03:00:53,840 --> 03:00:56,780
The Mass Turnpike,
what does is this route 90 wait,

4058
03:00:56,781 --> 03:00:57,870
what is this?
Yeah,

4059
03:00:57,880 --> 03:00:58,570
yes,
yes.

4060
03:00:58,570 --> 03:01:00,100
We're done.
Whatever it is.

4061
03:01:00,120 --> 03:01:01,640
Yeah.
Out here is that there's a,

4062
03:01:02,170 --> 03:01:04,240
on the east coast,
there's no the before it.

4063
03:01:05,290 --> 03:01:06,820
It's so weird.
Yeah.

4064
03:01:06,821 --> 03:01:08,280
I don't know what's going on,
but yeah,

4065
03:01:08,470 --> 03:01:10,300
there were national road went through 
Columbus.

4066
03:01:10,370 --> 03:01:15,000
It comes out to here to route 40 road 
that goes from Columbus right to here.

4067
03:01:15,010 --> 03:01:17,080
It goes from Washington DC actually like
San Francisco.

4068
03:01:17,120 --> 03:01:17,953
Holy Shit.
How long does it take to drive that 

4069
03:01:19,121 --> 03:01:22,930
bitch?
Is it the one that runs next to the 66?

4070
03:01:22,960 --> 03:01:24,220
Because when I moved out here,
yeah,

4071
03:01:24,250 --> 03:01:26,350
there was a,
there was like a dirt road that was like

4072
03:01:26,351 --> 03:01:30,970
a road but 66 it right along like 70 for
a long time and then it switches down to

4073
03:01:30,971 --> 03:01:34,300
like 10 isn't it?
That song get your kicks on route 66.

4074
03:01:34,780 --> 03:01:36,760
Have you ever driven across the country?
Yeah,

4075
03:01:37,210 --> 03:01:39,520
I've drove up here from Ohio twice.
Wow.

4076
03:01:39,880 --> 03:01:41,920
33 hours straight,
dude.

4077
03:01:42,430 --> 03:01:47,430
That is through serial killer with the 
little you on whose math?

4078
03:01:48,280 --> 03:01:50,860
Just switching off every eight hours or 
if you go to sleep hours.

4079
03:01:50,861 --> 03:01:51,694
Yeah,
just asleep.

4080
03:01:51,930 --> 03:01:53,410
I wouldn't trust that dude.
Stay awake.

4081
03:01:53,470 --> 03:01:54,810
Fuck that.
I made it.

4082
03:01:54,811 --> 03:01:59,180
Sounds like barely made it.
And I skated in time.

4083
03:01:59,230 --> 03:02:01,550
We had a jeep in the back of the haul 
two,

4084
03:02:02,140 --> 03:02:02,973
which was probably totally illegal.
Drove it into the u haul and parked it 

4085
03:02:07,751 --> 03:02:08,201
in there.
Oh,

4086
03:02:08,201 --> 03:02:09,960
that's so stupid.
Did you tie it down or anything?

4087
03:02:10,540 --> 03:02:12,310
Okay.
Well they do have those,

4088
03:02:12,311 --> 03:02:15,700
um,
those car transport trucks that are like

4089
03:02:15,701 --> 03:02:17,410
that though.
You weren't doing that.

4090
03:02:17,750 --> 03:02:19,190
You didn't know what you're doing.
Yeah.

4091
03:02:19,210 --> 03:02:21,370
Jesus Christ.
Yeah,

4092
03:02:21,371 --> 03:02:22,204
probably totally illegal.
And then you packed it old shit and the 

4093
03:02:24,101 --> 03:02:27,430
jeep so that if the jeep came bouncing 
out all your shit and go flying out with

4094
03:02:27,431 --> 03:02:28,264
it for a little bit of the people that 
packed it happen and help that they ran 

4095
03:02:30,520 --> 03:02:31,210
a tow company.

4096
03:02:31,210 --> 03:02:33,670
So like they kind of knew how to make a 
car stable.

4097
03:02:34,430 --> 03:02:36,460
Could fucking fuck one of its legal.
No,

4098
03:02:36,520 --> 03:02:37,353
no,
no.

4099
03:02:38,100 --> 03:02:42,310
Take,
that's your limitations.

4100
03:02:42,311 --> 03:02:45,220
Hopefully allegedly,
allegedly did all that.

4101
03:02:45,310 --> 03:02:48,010
A lot of the things that we say folks,
it's just jokes.

4102
03:02:48,910 --> 03:02:49,743
It's Shuma.
So while you work with George Perez 

4103
03:02:51,881 --> 03:02:53,140
Tonight,
George Perez,

4104
03:02:53,141 --> 03:02:57,730
Dean Delray topple the Bray Improv.
You can chose a funny motherfucker.

4105
03:02:57,820 --> 03:02:59,320
Yeah,
he's a wild dude,

4106
03:02:59,321 --> 03:03:01,360
man.
His stories about prison were hilarious.

4107
03:03:01,361 --> 03:03:05,140
He came in on the podcast and hit me 
with all his crazy stories.

4108
03:03:05,440 --> 03:03:06,880
He's,
he's great to hang out with.

4109
03:03:06,881 --> 03:03:08,140
I think.
I love that dude.

4110
03:03:08,260 --> 03:03:09,093
And we're going to San Jose.
30th offset at the Improv have two 

4111
03:03:12,071 --> 03:03:12,821
shows.
Oh,

4112
03:03:12,821 --> 03:03:13,654
nice.
Nice.

4113
03:03:13,750 --> 03:03:16,330
And the 30th this weekend is a Friday,
right?

4114
03:03:16,420 --> 03:03:19,410
Is that the 30th or the next week is a 
Friday.

4115
03:03:20,230 --> 03:03:22,800
The Ronda Rousey fight on Friday.
Yeah,

4116
03:03:23,060 --> 03:03:23,893
because the 31st is New Year's Eve.
Nobody wants to compete with New Year's 

4117
03:03:25,780 --> 03:03:26,020
Eve.

4118
03:03:26,020 --> 03:03:29,410
New Year's Eve is time to make shitty 
decisions and get fucked up.

4119
03:03:29,910 --> 03:03:32,890
Probably I'll be playing the Ronda 
rousey fight at the show.

4120
03:03:33,080 --> 03:03:34,090
Uh,
illegally.

4121
03:03:34,330 --> 03:03:37,080
Are you doing?
I'm even say that.

4122
03:03:37,170 --> 03:03:38,640
I'm just kidding.
Yeah.

4123
03:03:38,650 --> 03:03:39,850
People are going to go to see that 
anyway.

4124
03:03:39,851 --> 03:03:40,630
Yeah,
I'm fucked.

4125
03:03:40,630 --> 03:03:42,220
Well,
the beautiful thing about dvrs,

4126
03:03:42,221 --> 03:03:43,054
man,
you could,

4127
03:03:43,060 --> 03:03:45,670
you could go to both and you just record
the fight.

4128
03:03:45,880 --> 03:03:47,620
Don't,
don't listen to anybody.

4129
03:03:47,770 --> 03:03:48,680
Just go la,
la La,

4130
03:03:48,690 --> 03:03:51,510
spoiler alert and then just run around.
I hate spoilers.

4131
03:03:51,580 --> 03:03:54,280
I freaked out when Westworld,
I had the season finale.

4132
03:03:54,281 --> 03:03:58,010
Like I had to like walk force myself 
even though I was tired just

4133
03:03:58,010 --> 03:03:59,000
to watch it.
Just,

4134
03:03:59,030 --> 03:04:00,940
I didn't want to spoil it.
Yeah.

4135
03:04:01,220 --> 03:04:03,440
I got away with it.
I got away with it for like a week and a

4136
03:04:03,441 --> 03:04:04,100
half,
two weeks.

4137
03:04:04,100 --> 03:04:08,020
Nobody told me Shit.
A duct it total toin duct.

4138
03:04:08,030 --> 03:04:10,520
It slid right in there.
Yeah man.

4139
03:04:10,521 --> 03:04:13,670
But like people get mad at it.
But here's the deal.

4140
03:04:14,150 --> 03:04:17,260
There's so much to talk about today that
if we support,

4141
03:04:17,300 --> 03:04:18,133
if we didn't talk about like certain 
television shows and certain movies 

4142
03:04:20,751 --> 03:04:23,300
because of spoiler alerts,
like,

4143
03:04:23,301 --> 03:04:24,010
listen,
bitch,

4144
03:04:24,010 --> 03:04:26,270
you've got to take your chances.
If you want things to be secret,

4145
03:04:26,271 --> 03:04:28,010
you've got to stay offline.
Okay.

4146
03:04:28,040 --> 03:04:29,930
If it means something to you,
stay offline.

4147
03:04:30,950 --> 03:04:31,783
Otherwise people are going to talk about
it and don't get mad at people for 

4148
03:04:34,520 --> 03:04:37,760
deferred using information.
Right?

4149
03:04:37,880 --> 03:04:38,810
Amen,
sister.

4150
03:04:38,990 --> 03:04:42,800
Yeah.
It's that important to make time or just

4151
03:04:42,801 --> 03:04:43,634
deal with the fact that if you dip your 
fucking nose into the information 

4152
03:04:46,131 --> 03:04:46,964
highway,
you're going to get some information up 

4153
03:04:48,801 --> 03:04:49,610
there.

4154
03:04:49,610 --> 03:04:50,443
I can't believe you don't want,
I can't believe westworld and lost this 

4155
03:04:52,821 --> 03:04:55,940
in the same universe like it's crazy.
What the fuck up.

4156
03:04:56,420 --> 03:04:57,680
That's not true.
He just made that up.

4157
03:04:57,681 --> 03:04:59,510
But it is sort of,
it's the same guy,

4158
03:05:00,170 --> 03:05:02,150
right?
Could be the same world.

4159
03:05:02,240 --> 03:05:03,950
We never know,
but I mean,

4160
03:05:03,951 --> 03:05:05,210
isn't it the guy,
same guy,

4161
03:05:05,211 --> 03:05:07,640
Jj Abrams,
he didn't make it all by himself.

4162
03:05:07,641 --> 03:05:09,620
Lost,
but who made stranger things?

4163
03:05:10,180 --> 03:05:12,800
Somebody that's not a different group.
Some brothers,

4164
03:05:12,801 --> 03:05:13,634
right?
The grimm brothers or something like 

4165
03:05:14,151 --> 03:05:14,984
that.
They have a weird thing where they like 

4166
03:05:16,780 --> 03:05:19,310
to call themselves a fucking great show.
You shut your mouth,

4167
03:05:19,311 --> 03:05:20,920
boy.
I tried three times.

4168
03:05:20,921 --> 03:05:21,754
Now we'll go to the doctor and find out 
what kind of tumor you have in your 

4169
03:05:23,811 --> 03:05:24,644
head.
It's causing you like stuff that's 

4170
03:05:25,250 --> 03:05:27,440
socks.
Soap stuff's awesome.

4171
03:05:27,510 --> 03:05:29,090
Silverstone,
how dare you.

4172
03:05:29,280 --> 03:05:30,260
Okay.
What's going on?

4173
03:05:30,320 --> 03:05:31,910
Duffer brothers,
if the duffer brothers.

4174
03:05:31,990 --> 03:05:33,860
All right.
I love that show.

4175
03:05:33,890 --> 03:05:38,360
I understand you don't Brian Gilmore 
boys.

4176
03:05:38,390 --> 03:05:41,290
Awesome.
Love Jamie.

4177
03:05:41,291 --> 03:05:42,490
Do of it.
I didn't see it.

4178
03:05:42,530 --> 03:05:44,560
Does a new one called the o v or 
something like that.

4179
03:05:44,561 --> 03:05:46,100
I'm when I watch that.
What is that about?

4180
03:05:46,580 --> 03:05:47,660
Is it science?
Fictiony?

4181
03:05:47,710 --> 03:05:48,980
I think so.
It looks like it,

4182
03:05:48,981 --> 03:05:50,870
right?
Like she was blind and she came back and

4183
03:05:50,871 --> 03:05:51,704
she could see and she disappeared.
Not knowing what something's about and 

4184
03:05:53,601 --> 03:05:54,980
then just watching.
It sucks.

4185
03:05:54,981 --> 03:05:57,500
It sucks if whatever,
you wasted your time,

4186
03:05:57,501 --> 03:05:59,900
but if you find something cool,
it's the coolest way to find something.

4187
03:06:00,140 --> 03:06:01,640
I'm really getting in the house of 
cards.

4188
03:06:02,180 --> 03:06:03,560
That's a great show.
God Damn,

4189
03:06:03,561 --> 03:06:04,394
that's a good show.
I wonder how much of that is actually 

4190
03:06:05,961 --> 03:06:09,590
how things go.
100% it seems like it,

4191
03:06:09,591 --> 03:06:12,410
right?
They know so much right now about what's

4192
03:06:12,411 --> 03:06:14,570
going on because of house of cards.
Well,

4193
03:06:14,571 --> 03:06:15,950
there's never been a show like that 
before.

4194
03:06:15,951 --> 03:06:16,784
That shows you the inner workings like 
with swears and sex and all the 

4195
03:06:20,181 --> 03:06:24,080
craziness like good fucking chat and 
lots of west wing when it was out,

4196
03:06:24,081 --> 03:06:26,450
but I don't imagine it was as close to 
reality.

4197
03:06:26,451 --> 03:06:29,570
Is that this House of card seems gay guy
being straight.

4198
03:06:31,880 --> 03:06:32,930
What?
Kip?

4199
03:06:33,020 --> 03:06:36,590
Acting straight.
All right Brian.

4200
03:06:37,190 --> 03:06:40,010
I don't know what you're talking about.
You're saying that's how it really,

4201
03:06:40,030 --> 03:06:44,450
you think that's how it really goes and 
you know you mean Kevin Spacey or you're

4202
03:06:44,460 --> 03:06:49,370
trying to say I get it.
What do you want?

4203
03:06:50,390 --> 03:06:53,750
What do you want Brian and won a gold 
star tickle you.

4204
03:06:57,250 --> 03:06:59,160
I got,
I wonder if anybody has been,

4205
03:06:59,161 --> 03:06:59,880
go ahead and pee,
man.

4206
03:06:59,880 --> 03:07:00,713
Sorry.
I'll wrap it up.

4207
03:07:01,700 --> 03:07:03,720
We'll wrap it up now.
This is it.

4208
03:07:04,080 --> 03:07:05,010
The end.
All right.

4209
03:07:05,011 --> 03:07:07,380
Thanks everybody.
We will see you soon.

4210
03:07:07,410 --> 03:07:09,930
Happy,
happy a happy seven years.

4211
03:07:10,230 --> 03:07:12,300
Happy Christmas.
Happy Hanukkah.

4212
03:07:12,720 --> 03:07:15,480
Happy Kwanzaa.
Happy.

4213
03:07:15,481 --> 03:07:19,070
A powerful young Jamie.
Let's do holiday.

4214
03:07:19,110 --> 03:07:19,980
See Ya.
Bye.
