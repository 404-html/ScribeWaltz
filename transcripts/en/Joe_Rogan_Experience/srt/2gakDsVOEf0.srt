1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,350
Ooh,

2
00:00:01,351 --> 00:00:01,800
wait,

3
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:02,640
hey everybody.

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:09,420
If you never had one of
these podcasts before,

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,910
it's supposed to be us
watching the fights.

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,420
We're definitely gonna watch the fights
because Jamila is right about to fight

7
00:00:15,421 --> 00:00:18,720
Joe Lozan Holla Ho Shit.

8
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,700
But we're also,

9
00:00:20,701 --> 00:00:25,701
I'm intoxicated and we will be talking
shit about completely unrelated subjects.

10
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:27,650
Uh,

11
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:31,110
so don't totally expect people get
mad when we were at fort brick tome,

12
00:00:31,111 --> 00:00:31,740
Bro.

13
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:31,981
Where's,

14
00:00:31,981 --> 00:00:32,461
you know,

15
00:00:32,461 --> 00:00:34,170
says it doesn't always happen folks.

16
00:00:34,171 --> 00:00:34,741
Disclaimer,

17
00:00:34,741 --> 00:00:35,574
bitch,

18
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,470
we don't have a producer.

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,080
This is as close.

20
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:41,040
I mean we have Jamie,

21
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:46,130
but we don't have a like an executive
that's telling us how the show goes.

22
00:00:46,261 --> 00:00:47,250
So we just talk.

23
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:47,820
Um,

24
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,590
but the fight is going
to be awesome for sure.

25
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:50,430
It's a rematch.

26
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:50,941
Remember that?

27
00:00:50,941 --> 00:00:51,774
Fight the first fight.

28
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,340
[inaudible] remember any fights?

29
00:00:53,341 --> 00:00:54,640
Crazy blind magnitude.

30
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:55,830
Really close fight.

31
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,753
It was a war.

32
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:57,480
What happened?

33
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,110
I believe Miller wanted decision.

34
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:00,601
Jamie,

35
00:01:00,601 --> 00:01:01,230
see if,

36
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:02,063
see if I'm correct.

37
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,330
You don't even remember if you know,

38
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,590
how am I supposed to remember?

39
00:01:04,591 --> 00:01:04,981
Super,

40
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:06,060
super close fight.

41
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:09,090
I'm pretty sure that
Miller wanted decision.

42
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:09,900
Uh,

43
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,690
but I remember it being
really tightly matched.

44
00:01:12,691 --> 00:01:14,640
Like if you look at these
guys like skill wise,

45
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,900
you think about them like both guys
are like at this point in their career,

46
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:20,850
like super consummate pros.

47
00:01:20,851 --> 00:01:21,600
You know both.

48
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,160
There's real similar in that regard.

49
00:01:23,161 --> 00:01:27,180
Almost mirror images and the fact that
these bolts guys are so competent and

50
00:01:27,181 --> 00:01:29,430
they have some amazing
victories like Miller,

51
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:34,170
when he tapped out all the vera
Lozan just knocked out Diego Sanchez.

52
00:01:34,171 --> 00:01:34,741
I mean come on.

53
00:01:34,741 --> 00:01:37,350
I was like probably one of
his best victories ever.

54
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,800
How about when he was 19 I think it
was when he knocked out Jens Pulver.

55
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:43,020
Remember that Shit Dude?

56
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,370
Lozano is a beast.

57
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:46,883
Oh Shit.

58
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,060
All shed.

59
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:48,950
Good defense.

60
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,950
Good defense.

61
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:51,541
Hold guys.

62
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:53,250
You're super legit on the ground.

63
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,263
Fuck yeah.

64
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:55,951
Miller one.

65
00:01:55,951 --> 00:01:57,440
The first one in the a decision.

66
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:57,871
Yeah.

67
00:01:57,871 --> 00:02:01,800
See my members had that bad but I
remember it being a fucking war.

68
00:02:01,801 --> 00:02:02,011
Right.

69
00:02:02,011 --> 00:02:02,850
Was this split decision?

70
00:02:02,851 --> 00:02:03,684
Jamie?

71
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,040
Unanimous,

72
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,090
unanimous decision.

73
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,730
These are the kind of fighters
that fight to their full potential.

74
00:02:08,731 --> 00:02:09,780
They have so much confidence.

75
00:02:09,781 --> 00:02:10,650
They've done it so much,

76
00:02:10,651 --> 00:02:14,220
so much experience that you could trust
them no matter what crowd you put them

77
00:02:14,221 --> 00:02:14,611
in front of,

78
00:02:14,611 --> 00:02:16,440
no matter who you put in front of them,

79
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:17,460
they're going to do.

80
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:20,850
They're going to perform like
they do at the gym at their best.

81
00:02:20,851 --> 00:02:21,480
Yeah.

82
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,830
That's a great way of describing it.

83
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:25,800
Seasoned as fuck that doc sees.

84
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:28,260
Chipolte lay fried chicken and shit.

85
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,080
Three minutes and 50 seconds.

86
00:02:31,081 --> 00:02:36,081
(484) 074-0640 five if you want
to sync up in the first round.

87
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:38,070
Yeah,

88
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:38,680
there's a I.

89
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,010
This whole card is fucking bang up man.

90
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:43,110
I was real excited about this card.

91
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:45,990
They're both really good strikers
that both really good wrestlers.

92
00:02:45,991 --> 00:02:47,310
They're both really good at Jujitsu.

93
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:52,320
I mean Jim Miller is a wrestler who's
legit black belt that has really good

94
00:02:52,321 --> 00:02:53,230
office back.

95
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,150
He tap memory,

96
00:02:54,151 --> 00:02:54,984
tap for ratio.

97
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,630
Kimonti's captain in an
arm bar from the guard.

98
00:02:57,631 --> 00:02:58,360
I don't remember.

99
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:58,651
I was like,

100
00:02:58,651 --> 00:03:00,010
Holy Shit.

101
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,380
It was legit as fuck dude.

102
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:06,040
His Jujitsu is no joke
and that was on as well

103
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,260
as top shell.

104
00:03:09,261 --> 00:03:11,650
Fasting transitions.

105
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:12,671
He finished.

106
00:03:12,671 --> 00:03:13,504
He's a finisher.

107
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,950
He puts you in a triangle.

108
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,950
It's a probably 98% rap city,

109
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:18,670
you know,

110
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,170
you know what I like about Lowe's on too.

111
00:03:20,171 --> 00:03:23,500
It's like he goes from zero
to a hundred miles an hour.

112
00:03:23,501 --> 00:03:25,840
Like instantly he hits hard as fuck.

113
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:27,460
He's game.

114
00:03:27,461 --> 00:03:28,390
He's a true savage.

115
00:03:28,391 --> 00:03:31,540
You'd put them in the and the
coliseum against lions and shit.

116
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,450
Did you know what I mean?

117
00:03:33,451 --> 00:03:34,840
And you know what's interesting,

118
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:37,120
Super Nice Super Smart Guy.

119
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,051
When you talked to him,

120
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,310
he's like a tech wizard,

121
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:40,001
you know,

122
00:03:40,001 --> 00:03:44,680
you talked to them about video games and
you used to work on computers and when

123
00:03:44,681 --> 00:03:46,060
he dives on shit man,

124
00:03:46,061 --> 00:03:48,970
I mean he like completely
fully commence on things.

125
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,160
This is a little serious shit.

126
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,370
Pepino Cuevas versus a um,

127
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:59,110
Tommy Hearns or some shit.

128
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:00,250
Yeah.

129
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,320
This is classic shit really going on.

130
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:05,270
We're watching some classic MMA guys like,

131
00:04:05,271 --> 00:04:07,330
can't you look at like
top level professionals?

132
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:08,230
These guys were in,

133
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:08,920
you know,

134
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,820
for sure that the top of their class,

135
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:13,500
you know,

136
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:18,500
I would put either one of these guys
up against a lot of the 155 pounders in

137
00:04:19,481 --> 00:04:19,661
the,

138
00:04:19,661 --> 00:04:19,901
you know,

139
00:04:19,901 --> 00:04:20,681
the top eight,

140
00:04:20,681 --> 00:04:21,514
top nine,

141
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,420
you know,

142
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,920
did they get thrown down with anybody?

143
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,780
They could go right there
with Conor McGregor.

144
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,090
He can throw down key.

145
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,690
Imagine Joe Lowe's on Conor Mcgregor.

146
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,560
That would be amazing.

147
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:35,050
So God damn fast dude
got hit so goddamn hard.

148
00:04:35,051 --> 00:04:35,950
Holy Shit.

149
00:04:35,951 --> 00:04:37,510
It's not just hard man.

150
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:39,760
It's the accuracy is a big part of it.

151
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,110
I mean it's definitely hard.

152
00:04:41,111 --> 00:04:42,340
He hits hard as fuck,

153
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:47,370
but it's the speed and the accuracy
combined like his f eating.

154
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,900
You know what people give him
a hard time about doing that.

155
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:50,350
Uh,

156
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,270
Edo Port Dow Movement Shit.

157
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,153
Yeah.

158
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,490
I don't know man.

159
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,610
Because his movement is outstanding.

160
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:00,100
Like his ability to move his body.

161
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:01,630
I think people joke about that.

162
00:05:01,631 --> 00:05:02,680
They know it's the chin,

163
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,530
but it's just the way
he has called the touch.

164
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,001
You know what I mean?

165
00:05:07,001 --> 00:05:10,030
I think people know what's the
jet and his movement is great.

166
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:10,531
You know what I mean?

167
00:05:10,531 --> 00:05:13,000
Like to know how much of an
effect it really has had.

168
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,600
It's basically like a Kata.

169
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:16,150
Your mood,

170
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:16,530
you know,

171
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,010
you're even more crazy.

172
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,221
Oh,

173
00:05:18,221 --> 00:05:19,250
look at this fight dude.

174
00:05:19,251 --> 00:05:19,840
This,

175
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,673
oh,

176
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,790
these guys are going after it.

177
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,810
Good body shots.

178
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:25,540
Yeah man.

179
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,081
I just,

180
00:05:26,081 --> 00:05:27,700
I was so impressed with the way,

181
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:30,970
first of all is timing on
that left leg kick there.

182
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:31,451
Nice touch,

183
00:05:31,451 --> 00:05:32,350
but touch,

184
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:33,851
touch.

185
00:05:33,851 --> 00:05:34,684
But

186
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:39,603
have you seen that?

187
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:43,390
Have you seen the parody of
Nate Diaz and Conor McGregor?

188
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:43,900
There's,

189
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:44,491
there's dudes that,

190
00:05:44,491 --> 00:05:45,520
he's like a,

191
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,020
he uses a Nate Diaz type a
snapchat filter on my Instagram.

192
00:05:50,021 --> 00:05:50,980
There's a video of it.

193
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:51,760
Uh,

194
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,570
dude,

195
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:54,400
it's fucking hysterical.

196
00:05:54,401 --> 00:05:56,590
It's a parody climate.

197
00:05:56,591 --> 00:05:57,650
Gregor and Diaz.

198
00:05:57,651 --> 00:05:59,420
I getting a intimate,

199
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:02,330
getting like slightly gay.

200
00:06:02,331 --> 00:06:02,901
Have you seen this?

201
00:06:02,901 --> 00:06:03,201
No,

202
00:06:03,201 --> 00:06:03,620
I have not.

203
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,453
Oh dude,

204
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,940
it's so fucking,

205
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,810
that's hilarious.

206
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:15,080
The guy who does Nate Diaz is,

207
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:16,070
is perfect.

208
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:17,450
That could be a cartoon.

209
00:06:17,451 --> 00:06:19,940
Do just Nate Diaz and Conor Mcgregor,

210
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,770
like the odd couple just hanging out that,

211
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:23,060
that,

212
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,130
that'll be an easy hit.

213
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:26,630
Easy sensation

214
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:31,670
to the pace in which those guys
fought that five round fight.

215
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:34,700
I don't think I've ever screened
as much during that fight.

216
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,230
I was actually screaming going,

217
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:37,340
ah,

218
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,780
like Alton was a fight.

219
00:06:38,781 --> 00:06:40,370
It was so intense.

220
00:06:40,371 --> 00:06:42,230
That was a fight where I felt like,

221
00:06:42,231 --> 00:06:42,531
man,

222
00:06:42,531 --> 00:06:45,800
I would've rather done a fight
companion for this then call it.

223
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,500
Cause I wanted to swear a bunch of times.

224
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,570
Think I've ever got as
excited for any fight ever.

225
00:06:50,571 --> 00:06:50,990
Seriously.

226
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:54,230
Maybe the only other one
was Nogueira Bob Sapp.

227
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,580
That's the only other one.

228
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,000
God damn crazy.

229
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,080
That was such an amazing fight.

230
00:07:00,081 --> 00:07:00,914
Holy Shit.

231
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:01,821
Connor muck.

232
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:03,360
Fucking Gregor man.

233
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:03,810
Holy.

234
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:05,750
And they're both awesome.

235
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,830
They're both awesome.

236
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,750
That was a great fight.

237
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:09,730
You mean?

238
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:09,920
I,

239
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,970
I honestly,

240
00:07:10,971 --> 00:07:15,520
I haven't gone back and watched it
again and tried to score it and uh,

241
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:18,890
I stopped a long time ago trying to
score fights while I'm watching them,

242
00:07:18,891 --> 00:07:19,830
but I don't know what the fuck is.

243
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:20,170
I mean,

244
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:22,220
the fact that he went
five rounds and Nate Diaz,

245
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,510
he kept up with them.

246
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,750
I thought for sure if it went past three,

247
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:29,660
Nate was just going to completely
dominate and he fucking hung in there.

248
00:07:29,661 --> 00:07:31,310
Man survived that fourth round,

249
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:35,150
kind of seemed like he kind of caught a
second wind somewhere around the fourth

250
00:07:35,151 --> 00:07:39,740
round and he started a punching
like looser and more relaxed,

251
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,080
like sort of fell into a different pace.

252
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,040
Yeah.

253
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,280
You know that fight prove that Connor has,

254
00:07:46,281 --> 00:07:46,790
um,

255
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,380
he proved that he has legit heart,

256
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,090
she was in trouble.

257
00:07:50,091 --> 00:07:53,360
There are a couple of rounds and Nate
was messing them up and I had him against

258
00:07:53,361 --> 00:07:54,051
the fucking cage.

259
00:07:54,051 --> 00:07:58,250
It looked like he was slowing
down and he fucking regrouped.

260
00:07:58,251 --> 00:08:00,100
He got an second wind or
whatever you want to call it.

261
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:00,943
He came back and,

262
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:02,780
and fuck.

263
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,820
It was an important fight to watch,

264
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:05,690
you know,

265
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:10,690
cause that was a guy that had just decided
that he was not going to be defined

266
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,890
by this one fight and then what?

267
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:17,750
It was not going to be defined by his
past result and that he's better than

268
00:08:17,751 --> 00:08:18,020
that.

269
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:18,751
And he's going to come in,

270
00:08:18,751 --> 00:08:19,700
he's going to show everybody.

271
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:20,550
And Dude,

272
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:24,590
if he could keep that pace up that
he fought in that first round,

273
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:25,161
you know,

274
00:08:25,161 --> 00:08:28,440
it's like he's so explosive and
dominant cruisers talking about it.

275
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:29,750
And I was a really got me thinking,

276
00:08:29,751 --> 00:08:30,350
man.

277
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:30,741
He said,

278
00:08:30,741 --> 00:08:35,570
I don't know if you could fight in a
style like Connor does for five rounds.

279
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:36,771
And I thought about it,

280
00:08:36,771 --> 00:08:37,071
I was like,

281
00:08:37,071 --> 00:08:37,491
wow,

282
00:08:37,491 --> 00:08:38,324
man.

283
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:39,171
Dominick Cruz,

284
00:08:39,171 --> 00:08:40,460
first of all would know,

285
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:40,910
right?

286
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:44,510
If anybody's gonna know Dominic
is kind of super high fight Iq.

287
00:08:44,511 --> 00:08:47,330
So I considered it at a respect
and then I thought about it,

288
00:08:47,331 --> 00:08:47,601
I was like,

289
00:08:47,601 --> 00:08:47,691
well,

290
00:08:47,691 --> 00:08:50,900
there's only one way to
move that fast when we,

291
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:55,200
when Connor closes the gap and
blasts Nate with those left hands,

292
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,040
the fucking,

293
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,840
the speed and explosiveness of it,

294
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,480
that's a very tense movement.

295
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,820
Like that takes a lot of energy to do.

296
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:06,750
I think it takes way more energy than
what Nate does because what Nate and nick

297
00:09:06,751 --> 00:09:07,584
do,

298
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:12,570
the overwhelming you with volume and
they're overwhelming ability to maintain a

299
00:09:12,571 --> 00:09:13,530
certain level,

300
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:15,450
like a certain level of activity.

301
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,770
Like especially nick,

302
00:09:16,771 --> 00:09:17,790
he's the master at it.

303
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:21,150
Like maintaining a level of activity
that you can keep up for it and then turn

304
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,670
it on once they smell blood.

305
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,100
Yeah,

306
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,540
like the frank shamrock fight.

307
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:25,590
Great example of that.

308
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,430
Um,

309
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:28,920
the Paul daily fight is
a great example of that.

310
00:09:28,921 --> 00:09:30,150
There was a war.

311
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:32,590
Imagine fighting a guy that that's your,

312
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,940
that's their style.

313
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:34,601
And they said,

314
00:09:34,601 --> 00:09:35,434
where are you now?

315
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:37,390
And as soon as they smell blood,

316
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,790
that's when they turn it on.

317
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:40,330
You don't want a guy like that.

318
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,590
You want a guy that uh,

319
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:42,710
know

320
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:44,360
talking shit the whole
time he's punching you.

321
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:44,900
Yeah.

322
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:45,860
The whole time he's punching you,

323
00:09:45,861 --> 00:09:46,610
he was talking shit.

324
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:47,720
You never get to relax.

325
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:48,190
Yeah.

326
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:48,471
He's like,

327
00:09:48,471 --> 00:09:48,981
what bitch?

328
00:09:48,981 --> 00:09:49,710
What bitch?

329
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:50,543
He's hitting you.

330
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,220
I think there was a referee,

331
00:09:55,221 --> 00:09:56,840
I'm trying to remember who was fighting,

332
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,980
but there was a referee once.

333
00:09:57,981 --> 00:09:59,090
We're two guys were fighting.

334
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:00,710
I want to say it's Nick Diaz,

335
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:03,560
but it might not have been with the
referee was telling them to stop talking.

336
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:04,911
And I was like,

337
00:10:04,911 --> 00:10:06,710
don't tell him to stop talking.

338
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:10,040
Why would you tell them to stop
talking as if it's somehow or another?

339
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:13,130
It's worse to beat
someone's ass and talk shit,

340
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,170
then it is to just beat their ass.

341
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,540
That's so bizarre.

342
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,633
You know,

343
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:21,000
why can't you talk shit

344
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,830
and Nate Diaz is,

345
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:23,783
he's,

346
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,320
he's beyond a rockstar.

347
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:26,041
I mean he's,

348
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,810
he's as famous as a rock star.

349
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,321
I mean,

350
00:10:28,321 --> 00:10:29,154
right now,

351
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,330
dude on Instagram,

352
00:10:30,331 --> 00:10:32,010
he's already over a million followers.

353
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:32,670
I mean,

354
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,510
he is,

355
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,771
he's got it.

356
00:10:34,771 --> 00:10:38,010
That attitude that they'll
never be another Nate Diaz.

357
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:38,260
No.

358
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:38,930
He know what I mean.

359
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:39,570
You,

360
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:40,051
there'll be,

361
00:10:40,051 --> 00:10:40,261
I mean,

362
00:10:40,261 --> 00:10:42,780
can you imagine a guy trying
to emulate his personality?

363
00:10:42,781 --> 00:10:42,961
You know,

364
00:10:42,961 --> 00:10:44,610
they'll never be anybody like Nate.

365
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:45,960
And uh,

366
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,700
the one thing that impressed me,

367
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:52,620
one thing that impressed me a lot about
Nate Diaz is his ability to track,

368
00:10:52,621 --> 00:10:52,920
talk,

369
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,240
trash talk in the media pack.

370
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:54,901
I mean,

371
00:10:54,901 --> 00:10:55,830
that touched that stuff.

372
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:56,693
I mean,

373
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:01,320
some people thought he was going to
get trout and he got real real quick.

374
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,340
Yeah,

375
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:02,671
no,

376
00:11:02,671 --> 00:11:03,820
he's good at that.

377
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:04,021
He,

378
00:11:04,021 --> 00:11:04,381
first of all,

379
00:11:04,381 --> 00:11:07,020
he doesn't get rattled and that was
a big problem in the first fight,

380
00:11:07,021 --> 00:11:08,490
I think too with Connor did,

381
00:11:08,491 --> 00:11:09,450
he had to overcome,

382
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:12,540
this is the first guy that not
only did he not get rattled,

383
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:16,470
he got back at him and he made
them flinch at the weigh ins.

384
00:11:16,471 --> 00:11:17,580
I think that was big.

385
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,433
Yeah.

386
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:19,830
Bunch of people talked about that.

387
00:11:19,831 --> 00:11:22,360
Red Band was one of the first
people that pointed out to me.

388
00:11:22,361 --> 00:11:23,270
He sent me a thing.

389
00:11:23,271 --> 00:11:23,421
It was,

390
00:11:23,421 --> 00:11:23,641
dude,

391
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:23,821
look,

392
00:11:23,821 --> 00:11:24,654
he flinched.

393
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:25,140
I went,

394
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:25,681
Oh shit.

395
00:11:25,681 --> 00:11:26,514
He flinched.

396
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,230
That seems so stupid.

397
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:28,710
Yeah,

398
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:30,030
it seems so fourth grade,

399
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:32,970
but there might be something to do.

400
00:11:32,971 --> 00:11:34,650
It was that the greatest UFC fight ever.

401
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,211
God Damn it,

402
00:11:36,211 --> 00:11:36,391
man.

403
00:11:36,391 --> 00:11:37,290
It's so hard to tell.

404
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:38,850
There's so many good ones these days,

405
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,990
but it was a swap meet

406
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,383
flashlights.

407
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,880
The fact that the Connor's considered,

408
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:44,451
oh Ratti,

409
00:11:44,451 --> 00:11:45,950
he's considered one of the greatest.

410
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,990
Some people might say he's
the greatest of all time.

411
00:11:47,991 --> 00:11:49,970
Some people might say that just
based on what they've seen.

412
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,833
It is a,

413
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:51,940
it is amazing,

414
00:11:51,941 --> 00:11:54,700
but then there's condit Robbie Lawler

415
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,960
and the Nate Diaz as well.

416
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:56,823
Nate Diaz,

417
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,680
the guy that people consider this,

418
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,110
the new unstoppable force
made dia stopped him.

419
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,310
He choked him out.

420
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:03,890
Now,

421
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:04,723
second fight.

422
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:07,840
It could've went either way
and I had an ideas winning,

423
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,610
but when looking back at it again,

424
00:12:09,611 --> 00:12:09,791
I'm like,

425
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:10,061
shit,

426
00:12:10,061 --> 00:12:10,811
that second round,

427
00:12:10,811 --> 00:12:11,800
that's a hard one to score.

428
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,050
I see how it could've gone either way.

429
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:14,830
I really do.

430
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:17,710
It's almost a shame in a
fight that's that close.

431
00:12:17,711 --> 00:12:19,540
Like I would like to see
what the results are.

432
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,480
I think the majority of
people thought that Conor one,

433
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,770
and this is what I think you have to
consider those knockdowns and that,

434
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:30,070
that Connor was staggering him
with those straight laughs and,

435
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,720
and cracking them with those leg kicks.

436
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,201
You look,

437
00:12:32,201 --> 00:12:34,300
you're like decisive moments in the fight.

438
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:38,500
I feel like those decisive
moments of super crisp punching,

439
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:39,850
where knocks him down.

440
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,960
We used repeatedly landing that leg
kick that's kind of worth a lot.

441
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:47,500
Like he was lighting him
up barley at first round.

442
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,930
But if it meant that much,

443
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,370
you could look at it in another way.

444
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:52,263
If it made that much.

445
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:53,950
Maybe it didn't mean that
much because if it did,

446
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:54,963
how,

447
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:59,660
how was he on his back when the fight
ended and Nate Diaz is on top grounded and

448
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,020
pounded,

449
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:03,790
like if all that meant so much maybe
didn't mean that much after all.

450
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:04,241
Well,

451
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:05,380
I don't know man.

452
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:05,800
You know,

453
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,240
that's just another way of looking at it.

454
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,010
Cause it pride didn't,

455
00:13:09,011 --> 00:13:09,280
don't,

456
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:09,881
I mean it's,

457
00:13:09,881 --> 00:13:11,830
everybody knows that they uh,

458
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:14,350
judge fights based on how
the fight looks at the end.

459
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:15,243
So how would it,

460
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,890
how would the Japanese look at that?

461
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:21,070
Well that moment where
Nate's on top is huge.

462
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,960
When it finally takes him down.

463
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:23,800
That's huge.

464
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,633
I thought that's it.

465
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:25,631
That's what I thought at that.

466
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,200
Okay.

467
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,011
He got this round.

468
00:13:27,011 --> 00:13:27,550
Boom.

469
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:27,930
That's,

470
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:30,550
that's pretty huge because also
it's at the end of the fight,

471
00:13:30,551 --> 00:13:31,690
which I agree with you.

472
00:13:31,691 --> 00:13:35,260
I think it should matter more like,

473
00:13:35,261 --> 00:13:39,460
or like the Japanese had it for where
the last round was like the most

474
00:13:39,461 --> 00:13:39,971
important,

475
00:13:39,971 --> 00:13:40,510
right?

476
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:42,110
The judge the fight as a whole.

477
00:13:42,111 --> 00:13:43,630
But how does it look at the end?

478
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,550
Who's getting their ass beat at the end?

479
00:13:45,551 --> 00:13:47,260
Which is a real a point,

480
00:13:47,261 --> 00:13:47,561
right?

481
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:51,010
Because the whole idea about
what a fight supposed to be,

482
00:13:51,011 --> 00:13:53,050
it's supposed to be like
high level problem solving,

483
00:13:53,051 --> 00:13:53,380
right?

484
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:53,740
Yeah.

485
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:57,100
And there's some guys that present like
real scary problems and you've got to

486
00:13:57,101 --> 00:13:58,270
figure those problems out.

487
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:02,680
And whoever's winning towards the end
is the guy that really figured that

488
00:14:02,681 --> 00:14:03,550
problem out the best.

489
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:04,750
Cause the guy who was on the ground,

490
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:05,500
it's not,

491
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,180
you shouldn't really
be thinking in a fight.

492
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,410
Um,

493
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:09,520
just I've already ahead.

494
00:14:09,521 --> 00:14:11,320
I'm just gonna let this
guy get on top of me.

495
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:11,890
Like you don't,

496
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:12,790
nobody's thinking that.

497
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:13,360
Yeah.

498
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,680
So if the guy does take you down late
in the fight is because he's starting to

499
00:14:17,681 --> 00:14:18,580
overwhelm you.

500
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,240
Yeah.

501
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,860
That should be worth a lot.

502
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,360
It should be worth a lot.

503
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:23,890
I don't know how much though.

504
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:24,251
I mean,

505
00:14:24,251 --> 00:14:27,460
how much should a a knock down
like the ones that kind of event.

506
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:30,190
This is a slobber knocker Oh my God.

507
00:14:30,191 --> 00:14:31,420
These guys are going after it.

508
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,460
Oh Shit.

509
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,470
Throwing some bombs.

510
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:37,180
Holy Shit.

511
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,040
This is outstanding.

512
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,060
Oh street,

513
00:14:40,061 --> 00:14:41,170
right by Lozano.

514
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,133
Lozano.

515
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,410
Oh my God.

516
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:45,581
That was on.

517
00:14:45,581 --> 00:14:46,510
Got That Good Jab.

518
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,520
He's got real good boxing man.

519
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,151
Very good.

520
00:14:49,151 --> 00:14:49,984
Fundamentals

521
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,940
and heart.

522
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:56,150
Both of these guys got some hard.

523
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,150
Um,

524
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,080
it's interesting man.

525
00:15:00,081 --> 00:15:02,330
Deciding how fight should
be scored cause I don't,

526
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,490
I don't think they've got it down yet.

527
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,560
I think it still needs work as a system
because I think we had a bad head start

528
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:10,550
in MMA.

529
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,010
I'm starting off with
the 10 point must system.

530
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:16,580
I just don't think it's adequate
for all the aspects of MMA.

531
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:19,580
Boxing is only judging one dimension.

532
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:22,670
They're only judging
one style of striking.

533
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:23,750
It's just with the hands.

534
00:15:23,751 --> 00:15:24,200
That's it.

535
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,700
There's a clear rule set.

536
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:27,380
You could teach somebody yet.

537
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:32,380
I don't think a lot of people totally
understand who's even winning fights

538
00:15:32,381 --> 00:15:33,214
sometimes.

539
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,101
You know,

540
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:38,990
I don't think people understand who's
who's in a bad position and who's totally

541
00:15:38,991 --> 00:15:39,824
safe.

542
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:45,320
I just think there has to be a level of
competency in martial arts themselves to

543
00:15:45,321 --> 00:15:47,990
truly grasp it at the highest level.

544
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:51,950
That's why I think like former fighters
would be like Ricardo Almeida I know is

545
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,390
doing it in new New Jersey,

546
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,230
which is awesome.

547
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:57,270
And he's a brilliant guy and
it was a great fighter too.

548
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:58,340
Um,

549
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:01,580
and a black belt in Jujitsu
completely understand the ground.

550
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,400
Like that's the kind of
guy you want being a judge.

551
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:05,660
Like that's perfect.

552
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:09,940
You want a guy who really
understands the sport and it's,

553
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:14,300
we have to make some sort of
consensus as to what's most important.

554
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:14,541
Like,

555
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:15,374
if you're gonna,

556
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,930
if you're gonna judge the fight
the way we're doing it right now,

557
00:16:17,931 --> 00:16:18,681
round by round,

558
00:16:18,681 --> 00:16:22,250
and a guy could just be overwhelming the
guy towards the end of the fight and it

559
00:16:22,251 --> 00:16:24,890
looks like he's winning
and he loses a decision,

560
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,960
which I think we all agree,

561
00:16:26,961 --> 00:16:27,291
he's like,

562
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:28,490
it just doesn't make any sense.

563
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:28,981
See right here,

564
00:16:28,981 --> 00:16:29,280
here's a,

565
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,340
here's a good example.

566
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,160
The first half of this round,

567
00:16:32,161 --> 00:16:33,270
Jim Miller is all over.

568
00:16:33,271 --> 00:16:35,190
Joe Lozan landing the bigger shots.

569
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:38,300
But now the rounds ending with Joseph,

570
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:42,570
Joe Lowe's on getting the takedown and
as an over his half guard right now maybe

571
00:16:42,571 --> 00:16:46,020
not doing it the same kind of damage
that Jim Miller was doing on him on their

572
00:16:46,021 --> 00:16:46,854
feet.

573
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:48,600
So if the round ends here,

574
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,590
you know,

575
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,980
some people would give it to Jim,

576
00:16:52,981 --> 00:16:54,060
some people to give it to Joe.

577
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:54,960
Yeah,

578
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,600
well this is an awesome
round because there's still,

579
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,150
unless it's like a rule,

580
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:02,190
if in that situation,

581
00:17:02,191 --> 00:17:02,550
Mike,

582
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:04,130
they have those situations written out,

583
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,040
all the situations,

584
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,630
how do you score it in this situation,

585
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:07,681
you know?

586
00:17:07,681 --> 00:17:08,514
Uh,

587
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:09,330
but then,

588
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:09,551
you know,

589
00:17:09,551 --> 00:17:12,450
you basically take the judges out
of it and then it's more like a,

590
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,553
you know,

591
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,720
judging system is,

592
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:18,650
is it,

593
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:19,483
uh,

594
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,020
it's,

595
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:24,110
it's supposed to be an exact
science or do you want,

596
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:25,070
hmm.

597
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:25,821
It's weird man,

598
00:17:25,821 --> 00:17:27,320
because you and I might disagree.

599
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:27,591
Oh,

600
00:17:27,591 --> 00:17:28,424
look at that elbow.

601
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:29,690
I mean w we would,

602
00:17:29,691 --> 00:17:30,230
we,

603
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:33,830
it's very possible that we might
disagree about certain aspects of scoring

604
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:37,270
or maybe it's good that you
can trust the judges then that,

605
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:40,850
that forces the fighters to at not
leaving in the hands of the judges.

606
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:41,820
Like everyone else says,

607
00:17:41,821 --> 00:17:42,250
look man,

608
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:42,450
I don't know.

609
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:42,910
I don't know.

610
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,080
It just doesn't make any sense.

611
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,160
There's so many MMA fans out there
that would make amazing judges.

612
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:50,040
How people do you think to post

613
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,410
on the underground would
be incredible judges.

614
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,180
So many man,

615
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:55,440
there's so many experts.

616
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:58,440
Like think of these guys that are
doing these youtube clips now.

617
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:02,280
You know where there are breaking down
fights and talking about technique.

618
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:03,270
Have you ever seen a lot of those?

619
00:18:03,271 --> 00:18:04,200
Like Lawrence Kenshin?

620
00:18:04,201 --> 00:18:05,310
Do you ever seen his stuff?

621
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,260
No Man,

622
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:10,470
there's a lot of stuff on Muy Thai
and kickboxing and stuff and man,

623
00:18:10,471 --> 00:18:11,640
he knows his shit.

624
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,350
Beautiful videos.

625
00:18:13,351 --> 00:18:14,580
He's got them all over youtube.

626
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:17,370
Well you any breaks down all these uh,

627
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,680
different aspects of striking
and it shows what good,

628
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,350
what great fighters.

629
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:22,900
Uh,

630
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,540
look at this beautiful fucking fight,

631
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:24,870
man.

632
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:28,830
Joe Lozan staying on top where
he shows like where they,

633
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:29,190
uh,

634
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:33,570
errored and a where guys capitalized on
certain things and like certain traits

635
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:34,381
of guys had like,

636
00:18:34,381 --> 00:18:37,620
he had this breakdown
about custom motto and uh,

637
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:42,210
and Mike Tyson and his footwork and a
bunch of stuff on Moyie Thai and Jim is

638
00:18:42,211 --> 00:18:44,040
Jack Slack to add the custom auto one?

639
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,023
Does it bother you?

640
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,833
Oh,

641
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:48,733
oh,

642
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:51,550
oh fuck.

643
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:54,640
What a great ending.

644
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:55,930
Wow.

645
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:57,400
Did he went right for that arm?

646
00:18:58,930 --> 00:18:59,920
Oh my God.

647
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:00,730
He aunt.

648
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:01,750
So that was the end of the round.

649
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:02,853
It's the end of the fight.

650
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:03,641
I know,

651
00:19:03,641 --> 00:19:05,380
but like that was a,

652
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:07,150
that was a nice Harmar shit.

653
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:08,550
I thought you were scanning,

654
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,433
tapped,

655
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,273
escape.

656
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:11,223
What a fight.

657
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:13,540
Unless I didn't hear the bell.

658
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:13,991
No,

659
00:19:13,991 --> 00:19:14,824
I think you're right.

660
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,830
I'm pretty sure because
they're not showing the,

661
00:19:17,831 --> 00:19:18,310
uh,

662
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:19,710
they would be showing the finish if that,

663
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:21,663
what's that?

664
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,490
That was in around God damn.

665
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:26,653
Oof.

666
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:31,220
Powerful Joe Lowe's on what?

667
00:19:31,221 --> 00:19:32,054
The takedown.

668
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:32,381
Yeah,

669
00:19:32,381 --> 00:19:33,340
take towns are huge,

670
00:19:33,341 --> 00:19:33,940
man.

671
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,260
Guys don't want to be taken down.

672
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:38,050
It's like how much of a big deal is it?

673
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,030
It's gotta be worth a lot,

674
00:19:40,031 --> 00:19:40,630
man.

675
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:43,660
Cause someone's doing something to you
that you don't want them to do and it's

676
00:19:43,661 --> 00:19:44,494
hard to do it.

677
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:45,880
It's gotta be worth a lot.

678
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,500
And I know a lot of people say yeah,

679
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:48,341
but you know,

680
00:19:48,341 --> 00:19:50,590
sometimes you've got to take
you down and get right back up.

681
00:19:50,591 --> 00:19:51,311
It's no big deal,

682
00:19:51,311 --> 00:19:53,890
but it's still kind of a big deal.

683
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:56,680
It's still kind of a big deal.

684
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,480
Like I took you down,

685
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,510
you do monitor me,

686
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:00,160
take you down,

687
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,000
and he took you down.

688
00:20:01,001 --> 00:20:01,230
So,

689
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:02,770
and how long did it holds you there?

690
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:05,350
That's gotta be worth something.

691
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:06,550
It's just a question.

692
00:20:06,551 --> 00:20:07,384
I agree with that.

693
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:10,360
But what's worth more control or damage?

694
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,070
That's the big question,

695
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:12,910
right?

696
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:14,140
Like how do you define,

697
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:15,100
I don't think you can.

698
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:16,301
I mean,

699
00:20:16,301 --> 00:20:17,740
I don't think everybody's going to agree.

700
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:22,930
Striker's going to thank
[inaudible] important is a
worse than being controlled.

701
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:24,070
You got,

702
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,600
if it comes down between,

703
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:29,020
oh yeah dude took him down and
held on but didn't do any damage.

704
00:20:29,021 --> 00:20:32,800
But earlier in the round he got
hit with like three good shots.

705
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:34,210
Kind of snubbed them and rock them.

706
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:36,400
You go with the guy
that landed the punches,

707
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:36,701
right?

708
00:20:36,701 --> 00:20:37,600
You got to have damage,

709
00:20:37,601 --> 00:20:37,900
right?

710
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:38,320
Yeah.

711
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:38,680
Yeah.

712
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:43,150
Damage is huge because if you get rocked
that means you almost lost the fight

713
00:20:43,151 --> 00:20:43,690
right there.

714
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:44,140
Yeah.

715
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:47,980
If you get taken down and end up
in some dude's full guard or even

716
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,620
side control doesn't mean
the fire is almost over.

717
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,080
I mean if you,

718
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:57,700
if you get all the fights that had side
controlling them or full garden them and

719
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,480
factor in how many times the
fight ended from that position,

720
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:02,800
it's,

721
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,290
it's super low 0.0,

722
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:06,360
zero 2%

723
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:07,380
yeah.

724
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:07,860
You know,

725
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:08,693
this is,

726
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:14,880
I think there should be a
possibility of having long arounds.

727
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:17,010
I think it would be interesting.

728
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:20,590
I've always wondered like when you're
watching a five minute round and the guy

729
00:21:20,591 --> 00:21:25,370
takes a guy down at like three minutes
and 50 seconds and then for the next,

730
00:21:25,371 --> 00:21:25,640
uh,

731
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,473
you know,

732
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:31,080
minute is just completely
dominating on the ground and uh,

733
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,750
and you want to see where this plays out.

734
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:34,980
And then the bell rings.

735
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:39,400
Like that was one of the interesting
things about pride as he would see this,

736
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,330
this arc and those 10 minute rounds.

737
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:44,790
And I know as far as like
athletes performance,

738
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:48,360
it's not the best thing cause it's too
hard to do like chill son and thinks five

739
00:21:48,361 --> 00:21:50,700
minutes is too hard and he might be right.

740
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:51,631
You know?

741
00:21:51,631 --> 00:21:54,390
And now that everyone is all you cited,

742
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:55,171
they're a,

743
00:21:55,171 --> 00:21:59,280
they're forced to do this all
completely on the natural and it's,

744
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:01,500
it's gotta be hard to
fight for five minutes,

745
00:22:01,501 --> 00:22:02,334
but

746
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,280
is five rounds.

747
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:05,600
You got to have five minutes.

748
00:22:05,601 --> 00:22:06,210
I'm sorry,

749
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:07,043
five minutes.

750
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,440
Anything shorter than five
minutes is ridiculous.

751
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,750
It seems ridiculous for Grammar for sure.

752
00:22:11,751 --> 00:22:12,141
I think,

753
00:22:12,141 --> 00:22:12,800
uh,

754
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:17,060
organizations like the UFC or Bellator
should have the option to do fights where

755
00:22:17,061 --> 00:22:18,370
we're going to this special finds him.

756
00:22:18,371 --> 00:22:22,220
He one 10 minute round or something like
that or one five minute round and then

757
00:22:22,221 --> 00:22:25,010
a 10 minute round or 10 minute and then
a five minute like pride used to do.

758
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,480
Why the fuck not,

759
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:27,760
there's no reason why,

760
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,350
why you shouldn't be allowed to do that.

761
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:30,501
Oh,

762
00:22:30,501 --> 00:22:31,460
Jim Miller wins.

763
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:36,470
Split Decision Slobber knocker um,

764
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,640
it was perfect example,

765
00:22:37,641 --> 00:22:37,970
right?

766
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:38,360
Yeah.

767
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:43,360
He ended the fight ended
with him on his back mounted,

768
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:43,930
uh,

769
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:46,790
escaped that arm bar right
at the buzzer and he wins.

770
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:47,560
So,

771
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:47,930
uh,

772
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:50,750
but based on the point system,

773
00:22:50,751 --> 00:22:52,400
he must have won the
first and second round.

774
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,271
I just,

775
00:22:53,271 --> 00:22:53,511
yeah,

776
00:22:53,511 --> 00:22:56,300
I do not think the point
system is diverse enough.

777
00:22:56,301 --> 00:22:59,890
I don't think you can have a 10% like the,

778
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:03,020
the margin is always going
to be in these 10% bumps.

779
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:04,220
You know what I'm saying?

780
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:04,731
Like 10,

781
00:23:04,731 --> 00:23:05,091
nine,

782
00:23:05,091 --> 00:23:05,421
10,

783
00:23:05,421 --> 00:23:05,751
eight,

784
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:05,991
10,

785
00:23:05,991 --> 00:23:07,790
seven that seems crazy to me.

786
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:08,931
Like why,

787
00:23:08,931 --> 00:23:10,460
why these big jumps?

788
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:11,780
Why these big chunks?

789
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:13,070
Like 10 point why?

790
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:18,110
Why is one ten nine round
where guy totally kicks
guy's ass and it's a ten nine

791
00:23:18,111 --> 00:23:23,111
round and another one a ten nine round
where they're just barely squeaking by

792
00:23:23,601 --> 00:23:23,841
each other.

793
00:23:23,841 --> 00:23:24,910
You can't figure out who won.

794
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,060
You have no idea who won who.

795
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:27,050
How do you score that round?

796
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,990
And you look at the numbers like
equal number of punches and kicks,

797
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:33,440
landed equal number of take
downs attempted and defended it.

798
00:23:33,441 --> 00:23:34,610
What the fuck do you do with that?

799
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:35,140
You do?

800
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,110
You just pick a guy,

801
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,970
you know that's what a lot of guys do,

802
00:23:37,971 --> 00:23:38,241
right?

803
00:23:38,241 --> 00:23:38,510
Yeah.

804
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:39,280
That shouldn't be.

805
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,780
I said I didn't do that.

806
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:41,780
No you didn't know that.

807
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,720
If the first round was too close to call,

808
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,140
I'm like I'm not going to call that one.

809
00:23:45,141 --> 00:23:46,070
I now cause if the second

810
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:46,970
one is too close to call,

811
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:49,520
I'm going to give them around each and
then we're going to decide it and the

812
00:23:49,521 --> 00:23:50,030
third,

813
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:50,361
well that's,

814
00:23:50,361 --> 00:23:53,540
I'll just know that you used to do it
for the UFC cause it was so long ago.

815
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:54,980
A lot of people are not officially,

816
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,660
it was like just the way
I scored it in my you,

817
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,630
you weren't a judge for the UFC,

818
00:23:59,631 --> 00:24:02,900
but what you would do was
like Harold Letterman on Hbo,

819
00:24:02,901 --> 00:24:04,010
which I always loved.

820
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:07,670
I loved that aspect when
Harold Letterman would come on,

821
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:08,211
how,

822
00:24:08,211 --> 00:24:11,450
tell you how I see it gym and
he would go over the score.

823
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,500
You do you remember that guy?

824
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:12,711
Yeah,

825
00:24:12,711 --> 00:24:13,250
of course.

826
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:13,730
Yeah.

827
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:17,540
I mean he's the best and the
spot was based like rip that off.

828
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:17,990
Yes,

829
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:19,610
I know but it was,

830
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:21,200
but I liked that.

831
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:23,570
I think MMA could benefit
from something like that.

832
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,110
Yeah.

833
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:25,400
Got To get a real fighter in that.

834
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:25,800
Yeah.

835
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,030
And I never found you have
San never find them in Mesa.

836
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:29,270
I was the wrong guy.

837
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:30,590
You weren't the wrong guy.

838
00:24:30,591 --> 00:24:34,490
Cause you know a lot about fighting
and you had a really good system.

839
00:24:34,491 --> 00:24:38,090
Like your system is probably
like one of the best systems.

840
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,073
Plus,

841
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:39,561
uh,

842
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:40,190
if you're,

843
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:42,650
if you also analyze the
other aspects of the fight,

844
00:24:42,651 --> 00:24:43,710
like if you look at your system,

845
00:24:43,711 --> 00:24:47,390
like you would have like take down from
one column and then you would have like

846
00:24:47,391 --> 00:24:51,350
submissions and kicks and punches and
you just mark make marks for each guy

847
00:24:51,351 --> 00:24:52,011
whenever you did it.

848
00:24:52,011 --> 00:24:53,060
And then you'd look at it at all,

849
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,090
think about it in your head and
then decide like what was important.

850
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:58,810
But I think that is like the,

851
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,060
the,

852
00:24:59,060 --> 00:24:59,360
the,

853
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,550
the big catalyst is like,

854
00:25:01,551 --> 00:25:03,440
you know those subjective
calls that you have.

855
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,120
But towards the end of the round,

856
00:25:05,121 --> 00:25:07,250
even though he only landed
four or five punches,

857
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,140
he had his opponent really badly hurt.

858
00:25:09,141 --> 00:25:10,280
So I'm going to give him the round,

859
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:11,060
you know what I mean?

860
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:11,301
Yeah.

861
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:14,930
The only reason I did that is because I
had to go on air and I didn't know what

862
00:25:14,931 --> 00:25:15,711
the fuck I'm talking about.

863
00:25:15,711 --> 00:25:16,640
And when you're watching a fight,

864
00:25:16,641 --> 00:25:17,474
you forget.

865
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:19,010
So I would write any,

866
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:22,640
anything significant I would write
down and I have the shorthand for it,

867
00:25:22,641 --> 00:25:24,650
like left hook himself.

868
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:25,760
I went on air,

869
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:28,040
I could look down at that and go,

870
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:28,281
well,

871
00:25:28,281 --> 00:25:29,990
early in the round he had to take down,

872
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:34,250
but he did get knocked down and he'd
landed a couple leg kicks and I'm going to

873
00:25:34,251 --> 00:25:35,140
give the roundup boom,

874
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:35,690
you know,

875
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:38,720
that way I sounded like I actually
remembered what I was watching,

876
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:40,760
but that's cheating.

877
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:43,220
But it would make um,

878
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,730
scoring easier when I could
go back in the round and go,

879
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,840
Oh shit,

880
00:25:47,841 --> 00:25:47,901
oh,

881
00:25:47,901 --> 00:25:49,040
can we get it to this dude?

882
00:25:49,041 --> 00:25:49,550
Boom.

883
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:53,990
It's easier to go back and review it
around instead of going on pure memory

884
00:25:53,991 --> 00:25:55,880
because sometimes you forget
it's a five minute round.

885
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:59,690
Something happens in the first 45 seconds
and then a bunch of other shit happens

886
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:00,120
in the middle.

887
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,400
Now there's 15 seconds left,

888
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:02,570
some shit's going down.

889
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,070
You might have forgotten
that shit in the beginning.

890
00:26:04,071 --> 00:26:04,904
Huh?

891
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:05,601
You know why?

892
00:26:05,601 --> 00:26:06,434
I think too,

893
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,360
when you're really involved in a fight,

894
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:11,600
you're in the moment in a lot of ways.

895
00:26:11,601 --> 00:26:11,781
You know,

896
00:26:11,781 --> 00:26:12,501
you're watching it.

897
00:26:12,501 --> 00:26:12,711
You're like,

898
00:26:12,711 --> 00:26:13,491
what's going to happen?

899
00:26:13,491 --> 00:26:14,031
What's going to happen?

900
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:17,090
You'll locked in the moment
and I don't know about you,

901
00:26:17,091 --> 00:26:20,120
but when I'm in that spot I
don't have like the best memory.

902
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,070
No,

903
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:21,800
I know.

904
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,570
The more I'm enjoying a fight,

905
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:26,270
like I'll remember it after the fight,

906
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:28,270
but like while it's going on I'm,

907
00:26:28,271 --> 00:26:30,350
I'm thinking about what's
happening only and I'm like,

908
00:26:30,351 --> 00:26:30,920
Oh yeah,

909
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,670
that did happen.

910
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:32,121
Oh that's right.

911
00:26:32,121 --> 00:26:33,710
He took him down off the choke.

912
00:26:33,711 --> 00:26:34,100
I forgot.

913
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,090
How did I forget the choke?

914
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,081
I'm thinking,

915
00:26:36,081 --> 00:26:36,321
damn,

916
00:26:36,321 --> 00:26:37,550
I don't remember any of this shit.

917
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:41,390
Well you get so locked up in them
over a course of five rounds.

918
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:44,040
I know that Robby versus Carlos

919
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,630
condit was one of my favorite fights ever.

920
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,220
But I couldn't tell you what happened.

921
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:48,143
God dammit

922
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,960
conduit Maya is right now.

923
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:55,740
It's so exciting.

924
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,540
I love this fight.

925
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:59,940
You know there is hope that these,

926
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:03,600
these conversations that we have in
podcasts about the scoring system,

927
00:27:03,601 --> 00:27:05,010
it should be this or it should be that.

928
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:06,930
It is nice to know.

929
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,793
I thought they were,

930
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:08,521
to tell you the truth.

931
00:27:08,521 --> 00:27:10,140
There was a couple times he
got into it when I'm like,

932
00:27:10,141 --> 00:27:11,580
why the fuck are we
talking about this shit?

933
00:27:11,581 --> 00:27:12,840
This shit's never going to change this.

934
00:27:12,841 --> 00:27:13,674
It's like forget it.

935
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,281
You know what I mean?

936
00:27:14,281 --> 00:27:15,114
Let's just drop it.

937
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,433
Um,

938
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,870
but there is hope because
there have been changing.

939
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:19,271
Yeah.

940
00:27:19,271 --> 00:27:21,940
They made the new changes to
the touching and the ground,

941
00:27:21,941 --> 00:27:22,360
right?

942
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:22,731
Yes.

943
00:27:22,731 --> 00:27:23,140
Explain.

944
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:23,973
You probably know you,

945
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:26,230
I think you told me so
can you refresh my memory?

946
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:26,530
Yeah.

947
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:26,981
This is,

948
00:27:26,981 --> 00:27:31,180
I don't want to screw this up and I'm not
exactly sure it goes when it goes into

949
00:27:31,181 --> 00:27:31,511
play.

950
00:27:31,511 --> 00:27:32,930
I probably should know this year.

951
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:33,880
First of the year.

952
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,100
Yeah.

953
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,440
That's what I look at Jamie.

954
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,313
Powerful

955
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:39,890
way into where you are in the UFC.

956
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:40,660
Big Time.

957
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,880
When you first started working with chuck,

958
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,240
that really someone looked at me,

959
00:27:43,241 --> 00:27:44,750
look this up during the
fights last weekend.

960
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:46,810
So you were just a Joe Rogan Fan,

961
00:27:46,811 --> 00:27:47,321
but you're like,

962
00:27:47,321 --> 00:27:48,310
when he would talk about MMA,

963
00:27:48,311 --> 00:27:48,670
you'd be like,

964
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:49,330
ah,

965
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:50,163
right.

966
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,340
Can we turn it off and shit.

967
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,890
It still doesn't stick
very much for some reason.

968
00:27:53,891 --> 00:27:54,724
I don't know why.

969
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:56,440
But you do enjoy the shows.

970
00:27:56,441 --> 00:27:57,560
Now write down 100%.

971
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,650
Would you consider yourself a fan?

972
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:01,060
Like he'd go on [inaudible]
website and ship.

973
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:01,980
Awesome.

974
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,880
I love watching like the embedded stuff,

975
00:28:03,881 --> 00:28:05,290
like getting pumped up for fan.

976
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,290
Then you're pretty cool.

977
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:07,203
Check.

978
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:09,640
Jamie's a fan of a lot of sports though.

979
00:28:09,641 --> 00:28:12,130
And a man only has so much
fucking free time in the day.

980
00:28:12,131 --> 00:28:13,090
When you talked to Jamie,

981
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,880
he knows his shit when he
knows college basketball.

982
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,410
He's one of those mother fuckers.

983
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:20,770
He's one of them college
football motherfuckers who

984
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:23,170
he watched him.

985
00:28:23,171 --> 00:28:23,640
You just,

986
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,473
I'm just,

987
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:25,773
I'm trying to,

988
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:26,561
I'm just like,

989
00:28:26,561 --> 00:28:27,010
okay.

990
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:28,780
I'm always check with the sometimes,

991
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:30,043
um,

992
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,580
this girl's fight now,

993
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:34,240
Paige vanzant and Beck Rawlings.

994
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,160
This is a good fight,

995
00:28:36,161 --> 00:28:36,640
man.

996
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,470
This is going to be a crazy fight.

997
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:39,250
Shit.

998
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,870
Back Rawlings is bad ass.

999
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,130
And so his page,

1000
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:45,520
that page girl goes straight from
dancing with the stars and was like,

1001
00:28:45,521 --> 00:28:46,360
get me a fight.

1002
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:47,381
Get right.

1003
00:28:47,381 --> 00:28:49,030
But she's 23 years old,

1004
00:28:49,031 --> 00:28:49,480
dude.

1005
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:53,050
Game is fuck both of those girls.

1006
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:55,300
This is going to be an awesome fight,

1007
00:28:55,301 --> 00:28:56,134
man.

1008
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:58,390
This is a good one for Fox.

1009
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:00,203
Yeah.

1010
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:00,541
I mean,

1011
00:29:00,541 --> 00:29:01,970
that's always good to have it.

1012
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:07,030
Isn't it crazy that MMA
is the sport where girls,

1013
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:12,800
women found a fucking hole out of now
they can just blossom and explode through

1014
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:14,341
the galaxy.

1015
00:29:14,341 --> 00:29:17,730
Now they can't do that
with women's basketball.

1016
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:18,870
No one's watching that shit.

1017
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,940
Women's baseball.

1018
00:29:20,941 --> 00:29:22,080
There's no women's baseball.

1019
00:29:22,081 --> 00:29:24,570
They've got women's softball
and they show the college,

1020
00:29:24,571 --> 00:29:25,410
but there's no future.

1021
00:29:25,411 --> 00:29:27,000
There's no money in any of that shit.

1022
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,130
They'll show women's fucking volleyball,

1023
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:31,230
but there's no pro women's
volleyball leagues.

1024
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,310
That's a good idea.

1025
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:33,000
Uh,

1026
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,200
but you know,

1027
00:29:34,201 --> 00:29:35,280
you're watching the Olympics,

1028
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:35,761
right?

1029
00:29:35,761 --> 00:29:37,050
You're watching the Olympics and I'm like,

1030
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:38,730
there,

1031
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:39,950
they barely show,

1032
00:29:39,951 --> 00:29:41,320
when they show men's volleyball,

1033
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:42,130
it's like for three

1034
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:42,491
minutes,

1035
00:29:42,491 --> 00:29:42,761
it's like,

1036
00:29:42,761 --> 00:29:43,120
okay,

1037
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,820
what's the least amount of time we
can get away with showing the men's

1038
00:29:45,821 --> 00:29:47,650
volleyball so they could
focus on the women?

1039
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,140
The women volleyball
players are superstars,

1040
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:51,011
but like the men,

1041
00:29:51,011 --> 00:29:51,311
they're like,

1042
00:29:51,311 --> 00:29:51,581
okay,

1043
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:52,091
two minutes.

1044
00:29:52,091 --> 00:29:52,924
Okay,

1045
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,960
no one's paying attention
to the men's volleyball.

1046
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:58,120
Nobody watches has got
the lowest ratings ever.

1047
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:02,470
But for some reason people are interested
in women's volleyball or the beach.

1048
00:30:02,471 --> 00:30:05,740
But how did beach volleyball
become an Olympic sport?

1049
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:07,360
Jujitsu dude.

1050
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:09,970
Seeing what they're wearing.

1051
00:30:09,971 --> 00:30:10,661
Fantastic.

1052
00:30:10,661 --> 00:30:11,411
Holy Shit.

1053
00:30:11,411 --> 00:30:12,520
Areas that we think,

1054
00:30:12,521 --> 00:30:12,881
look no,

1055
00:30:12,881 --> 00:30:14,230
they have to be almost naked.

1056
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:14,501
Oh,

1057
00:30:14,501 --> 00:30:15,334
it's falling.

1058
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:16,840
Oh it's volleyball.

1059
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:20,080
Volleyball is such a sophisticated sport.

1060
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:20,741
Oh my God.

1061
00:30:20,741 --> 00:30:21,130
I love,

1062
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:22,150
it's a lot to it,

1063
00:30:22,151 --> 00:30:22,541
man.

1064
00:30:22,541 --> 00:30:22,991
First of all,

1065
00:30:22,991 --> 00:30:24,580
you can't play it in shorts.

1066
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:27,963
Can't be done.

1067
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:28,711
You,

1068
00:30:28,711 --> 00:30:29,840
you must wear,

1069
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:32,801
it's the best.

1070
00:30:32,801 --> 00:30:33,281
Trust me.

1071
00:30:33,281 --> 00:30:36,220
You'll get better vertical
loose shorts or anything.

1072
00:30:36,221 --> 00:30:36,761
Baggies.

1073
00:30:36,761 --> 00:30:37,271
Not Good.

1074
00:30:37,271 --> 00:30:37,570
Yeah.

1075
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:38,830
They'll put sun lamps on you.

1076
00:30:38,831 --> 00:30:39,131
Bitch,

1077
00:30:39,131 --> 00:30:40,010
take your clothes off.

1078
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:43,720
It's that hot enough.

1079
00:30:43,721 --> 00:30:45,160
Could someone make a fire?

1080
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:49,130
I think volleyball and then the gymnastic

1081
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,120
trying to find men's gymnastics.

1082
00:30:52,121 --> 00:30:53,680
It's on for three minutes.

1083
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:54,643
They go,

1084
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,830
they go to Bob Costas.

1085
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,830
He gives you a quick review and then
they go to the seven hours straight.

1086
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:01,900
They do the curls all day.

1087
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:02,621
The guys,

1088
00:31:02,621 --> 00:31:05,090
they want to see them do the rings
or they want to see him break a leg.

1089
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:05,260
Yeah.

1090
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:05,801
Real quick.

1091
00:31:05,801 --> 00:31:06,634
Just in and out.

1092
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:10,000
We'll fit them in digital little
dead time cause they got it.

1093
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:11,320
They can't make it that obvious.

1094
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,393
Come on.

1095
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:17,910
They came us women's
gymnastics and volleyball and
soccer and all that shit you

1096
00:31:17,951 --> 00:31:20,150
can't do that is when
they got a fucking bar.

1097
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:24,220
Is Women's volleyball like
the most sexist sport ever?

1098
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,113
Like look,

1099
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,830
come on.

1100
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:30,190
I'm not saying there's anything wrong
with it if they want to dress like that,

1101
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:34,270
but the fact that they make them all just
like that is that real picture fucking

1102
00:31:34,271 --> 00:31:35,104
crazy.

1103
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,700
Like this isn't like,

1104
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:38,810
it's not like to stay alive or something.

1105
00:31:38,811 --> 00:31:40,810
Do you need to wear like as
little clothing as possible?

1106
00:31:40,811 --> 00:31:43,660
Like that doesn't make any sense
why they're in their underwear.

1107
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:44,500
Look at this.

1108
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:44,980
Look at that.

1109
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:45,813
Why the fuck?

1110
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:47,370
What am I picks?

1111
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:50,380
Are they going to be allowed
to wear thongs or is it
written somewhere that they

1112
00:31:50,381 --> 00:31:51,850
can't actually wear a thong?

1113
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,713
Is that,

1114
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:54,790
why did they have to dress like with that?

1115
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:55,990
That's a ridiculous,

1116
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:56,883
and they're in

1117
00:31:58,570 --> 00:31:59,560
very hot on the beach.

1118
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:00,910
It's so stupid.

1119
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:03,320
Beach Volleyball's in an Olympics poured

1120
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:06,123
out on the beach.

1121
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:06,441
Yeah,

1122
00:32:06,441 --> 00:32:07,000
dude,

1123
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,960
I go to the beach too.

1124
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,380
I don't wear underwear like that.

1125
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:12,190
Like that same fucking beach.

1126
00:32:12,191 --> 00:32:13,001
I wear shorts.

1127
00:32:13,001 --> 00:32:13,834
It's incredible.

1128
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:14,300
Team,

1129
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:14,830
Egypt was,

1130
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:15,760
oh my God,

1131
00:32:15,761 --> 00:32:17,200
Egypt's than just like mummies.

1132
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,330
Three people watch men's volleyball.

1133
00:32:19,331 --> 00:32:19,601
Come on,

1134
00:32:19,601 --> 00:32:20,171
think about that.

1135
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:21,640
Who's watching men's volleyball?

1136
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,770
Why does Egypt have to
wear so much clothes?

1137
00:32:23,771 --> 00:32:24,700
That a religious thing.

1138
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:25,150
Yeah.

1139
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:25,983
Wow.

1140
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:28,420
I would like to see that game.

1141
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:29,650
Are there highlights of that one?

1142
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:33,370
I want to see the think that there would
be a benefit in wearing that as far as

1143
00:32:33,371 --> 00:32:36,330
like not getting your skin
scratched up by the sand look.

1144
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:37,203
Does that make sense?

1145
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,033
But that would make you,

1146
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,270
that's brutal man.

1147
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,900
Religions that make you
wear certain clothes.

1148
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:48,260
Like you're only allowed
to wear certain clothes.

1149
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:49,530
How bout and everyone's like,

1150
00:32:49,531 --> 00:32:50,271
you will kill you,

1151
00:32:50,271 --> 00:32:53,420
but if you cut your dick
off you can cause a,

1152
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:55,490
apparently it's okay.

1153
00:32:55,491 --> 00:32:59,270
It doesn't say that you can't be
a transvestite or a transgender,

1154
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:02,060
but you can't be gay if you're gay.

1155
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:04,310
A lot of gay people in the Middle East,

1156
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,680
they got to become
transgenders or they'll die.

1157
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:08,990
I read something about
that's on vice news.

1158
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:10,940
Bullshit is vice real.

1159
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:12,290
I saw that on vice news.

1160
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:13,160
Well,

1161
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,530
you know it's a whole
episode of vice covers.

1162
00:33:15,531 --> 00:33:17,090
A lot of different subjects from what?

1163
00:33:17,091 --> 00:33:18,110
A lot of different authors,

1164
00:33:18,111 --> 00:33:18,944
but they,

1165
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:21,690
if they're saying it so well,

1166
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:23,420
it's Shane Smith is a friend of mine,

1167
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:24,523
the guy who owns it.

1168
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:30,230
But Fox that show as a matter of how
much it's happening in my bs and might be

1169
00:33:31,641 --> 00:33:32,474
insignificant.

1170
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:33,800
Olympics,

1171
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:37,460
Mongolian wrestling coaches
strip and protest of loss.

1172
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:40,080
What they started,

1173
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:42,190
they started throwing their
clothes at the judges.

1174
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:43,093
Oh my God.

1175
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,360
Was it a decision that bad?

1176
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:49,850
Pretty bad about the guys that
got robbed and real right there.

1177
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:50,810
Did that happen a lot?

1178
00:33:50,811 --> 00:33:51,021
Oh,

1179
00:33:51,021 --> 00:33:51,830
it didn't happen.

1180
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:52,910
Like I made that story.

1181
00:33:52,911 --> 00:33:53,744
That was bullshit.

1182
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:54,811
Nobody got rob.

1183
00:33:54,811 --> 00:33:55,071
No,

1184
00:33:55,071 --> 00:33:56,000
he didn't get robbed.

1185
00:33:56,001 --> 00:33:56,834
Man.

1186
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,100
Don't even hear about this.

1187
00:33:58,101 --> 00:33:59,000
I wonder if that's a lie.

1188
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:00,680
Well,

1189
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,030
they have video cameras.

1190
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:04,070
That's why he had to tell the real story.

1191
00:34:04,071 --> 00:34:07,310
They had security cameras from the
place you might go to jail for it.

1192
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:08,203
Oh,

1193
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,650
so nobody got robbed?

1194
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:10,221
No,

1195
00:34:10,221 --> 00:34:10,840
not,

1196
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,170
not only did you get robbed,

1197
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:15,090
but he changed his story and a,

1198
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:16,520
he sponsors dumped him.

1199
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:17,661
He had a like a,

1200
00:34:17,661 --> 00:34:19,130
a massive sponsored dump.

1201
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:20,870
He was drunk.

1202
00:34:20,871 --> 00:34:21,980
I guess he fucked up.

1203
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:25,580
I mean a guy did apparently
pull a gun on them,

1204
00:34:25,581 --> 00:34:26,414
right?

1205
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:27,403
Didn't the guy,

1206
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,840
apparently the vandalized a gas station.

1207
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:30,160
Right.

1208
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:33,280
And the security guard was making
them pay for it and you didn't.

1209
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:34,640
And whether or not they
wanted to do or not,

1210
00:34:34,641 --> 00:34:37,310
but did the security
guard to make them pay?

1211
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,380
Did okay?

1212
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:40,521
Yeah.

1213
00:34:40,521 --> 00:34:41,600
But see man,

1214
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:43,370
okay.

1215
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:44,780
Even that alone,

1216
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,370
like that story alone,

1217
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,570
if they just told the truth,

1218
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,590
that's pretty sketchy.

1219
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:51,500
You know what was the truth?

1220
00:34:51,501 --> 00:34:53,210
A gun pulled on you in Brazil.

1221
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:55,220
So the gun did get pulled on them.

1222
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:57,300
Apparently they vandalize a door.

1223
00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:00,020
Julie say Ryan Lochte,

1224
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:01,090
the Heisei.

1225
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,600
So the guide that's
claiming they got robbed,

1226
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:04,640
he was doing some bet vandalizing.

1227
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,240
Now he,

1228
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,610
I just think they were drunk apparently.

1229
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,420
And um,

1230
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:09,290
I like to say apparently,

1231
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:09,471
look,

1232
00:35:09,471 --> 00:35:11,270
I'm a lawyer or some shit.

1233
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,033
Um,

1234
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:13,691
and they,

1235
00:35:13,691 --> 00:35:14,270
they,

1236
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:16,610
they broke a bathroom door or something.

1237
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:17,421
Is that the story?

1238
00:35:17,421 --> 00:35:18,254
Jamie?

1239
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:20,060
We're going to give you
the whole story folks.

1240
00:35:20,061 --> 00:35:20,271
I know.

1241
00:35:20,271 --> 00:35:22,100
How frustrating is if
you listen to this shit,

1242
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:26,270
how bout are going after it
about backpacking pay job?

1243
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:27,620
She's a very good striker.

1244
00:35:27,621 --> 00:35:28,640
Has been backing her up.

1245
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:29,960
She's a very good striker man.

1246
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:31,470
Maybe pages is a,

1247
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,130
that's a strategy is to
make her come to her.

1248
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:35,420
Maybe page.

1249
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:35,631
Ooh,

1250
00:35:35,631 --> 00:35:37,740
that's a nice knee to deliver back.

1251
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:38,090
Rawlings

1252
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:39,000
is no joke man.

1253
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:41,190
Her striking is very legit.

1254
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,170
Super aggressive with it too.

1255
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:50,050
And you see a girl with Dominique
tattoos like that chick is not scared.

1256
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:54,663
Gotcha.

1257
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:56,280
She's not scared.

1258
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:57,840
She's not scared of pain.

1259
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,060
She's not scared to fuck you.

1260
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:00,360
Oh Jesus.

1261
00:36:00,361 --> 00:36:01,260
What a combination.

1262
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:04,850
Raleigh going off like
nice knee to the body.

1263
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,420
Good striking dude.

1264
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:07,283
I'm telling you.

1265
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:08,870
She ain't say Jill bows.

1266
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,331
Yes.

1267
00:36:09,331 --> 00:36:10,230
Very nice.

1268
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,093
Very nice.

1269
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:15,330
You know she takes like two months and
she goes down to alliance and she trains.

1270
00:36:15,331 --> 00:36:16,140
It's a Eric,

1271
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,340
Eric del Faro

1272
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:22,270
who is one of the most unheralded guys.

1273
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,340
Added all the top guys.

1274
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:26,080
He doesn't get talked about enough.

1275
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,420
He's a bad motherfucker.

1276
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:30,220
Eric is very,

1277
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:33,670
very wise when it comes to MMA knowledge.

1278
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:35,290
Very wise man.

1279
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:37,210
I like his corner work.

1280
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,110
I,

1281
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:40,000
I've seen videos of him coaching guys.

1282
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:40,781
Oh Shit.

1283
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:42,240
She puts on dancing with the stars.

1284
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:43,900
She went Capo era.

1285
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:46,360
She tutored a tornado kick.

1286
00:36:46,361 --> 00:36:47,194
My friends,

1287
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:50,560
she does not want to be in the inside
with Rawlings Rawlings was hitting her

1288
00:36:50,561 --> 00:36:51,880
with too many different things.

1289
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:55,090
She was hitting her with punches up top
and then knees to the body and the niece

1290
00:36:55,091 --> 00:36:55,870
of the body,

1291
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:57,790
two or three of them look real good.

1292
00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:00,430
And also like her distance is real good.

1293
00:37:00,431 --> 00:37:05,431
Like see how she's like sliding outside
of pages stuff too but constantly

1294
00:37:05,801 --> 00:37:09,550
pressuring her so she's making
page explode forward and then she,

1295
00:37:09,551 --> 00:37:13,870
it's nowhere near her and then she's
constantly keeping up that pace on see I

1296
00:37:13,871 --> 00:37:14,980
paid takes that chance,

1297
00:37:14,981 --> 00:37:17,800
throws that Kik would then comes
up empty and she gets popped.

1298
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,633
Popped.

1299
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:18,971
Yeah.

1300
00:37:18,971 --> 00:37:20,260
That's not a good feeling.

1301
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,210
That is not a good feeling.

1302
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:26,560
You can see like when one person is just,

1303
00:37:26,561 --> 00:37:29,320
I'm starting to catch fire,

1304
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:32,630
starting to find it and feel
it and then you see like uh,

1305
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:34,810
their skill levels play out too.

1306
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:37,900
Like vanzant like super
scrappy on the ground,

1307
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:38,920
really tough.

1308
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:42,760
But Rawlings is just a
seasoned striker man.

1309
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,320
Really Crisp.

1310
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:46,211
Like,

1311
00:37:46,211 --> 00:37:47,770
look at those mu the movement right there.

1312
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,550
Like though she sets up and
then she doesn't like it.

1313
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,970
She's not there.

1314
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:52,923
See Ya.

1315
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:54,820
Like if you hit her,

1316
00:37:54,821 --> 00:37:56,350
you're catching her on the end to shit.

1317
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:57,850
She's sliding away from it.

1318
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:04,260
Very interesting cause you're seeing
like the level of skill and women's MMA

1319
00:38:05,141 --> 00:38:06,820
like continue to go up and up.

1320
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:09,730
These girls are having
fucking dog fights man.

1321
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:11,940
Some of the fights we've seen

1322
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,850
and more and more of them
are developing power.

1323
00:38:13,851 --> 00:38:14,080
Yeah.

1324
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:14,570
Ooh,

1325
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:17,540
Paige vanzant with US jumping
round kick to the body.

1326
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:17,961
That one.

1327
00:38:17,961 --> 00:38:18,411
See that?

1328
00:38:18,411 --> 00:38:19,244
Yeah.

1329
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:20,310
Okay.

1330
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:23,730
That and that other spinning kick that
she missed by a mile but was awesome

1331
00:38:23,731 --> 00:38:24,230
looking.

1332
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:26,520
She's going to be on
slowmo highlight reel.

1333
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:27,020
What?

1334
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:30,000
Someone caught that someone
got shot in the truck.

1335
00:38:30,001 --> 00:38:31,020
Did you save that?

1336
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,180
It's so true.

1337
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:34,181
It's so true.

1338
00:38:34,181 --> 00:38:35,200
Isn't that a good shot of that?

1339
00:38:35,201 --> 00:38:36,340
Which is just up there spinning

1340
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:36,701
like that.

1341
00:38:36,701 --> 00:38:37,180
Yeah.

1342
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,110
In the middle of a fight.

1343
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,420
It doesn't matter if we landed,

1344
00:38:40,421 --> 00:38:42,070
we just need a couple
of just one per round.

1345
00:38:42,071 --> 00:38:43,060
Just give me something crazy.

1346
00:38:43,061 --> 00:38:44,230
But they told her to do it.

1347
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:44,520
Do it.

1348
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:47,950
Just do some crazy dancing with thinking
about a Nike commercial or something.

1349
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:48,821
Well Reebok,

1350
00:38:48,821 --> 00:38:49,240
I'm sorry.

1351
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:49,661
Oh,

1352
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:50,860
nice combination.

1353
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:53,380
Right leg kick and then
a right hand by page.

1354
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:55,130
Okay,

1355
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:56,780
Paige starting to find our rhythm man.

1356
00:38:56,781 --> 00:38:57,411
Maybe page,

1357
00:38:57,411 --> 00:38:57,770
this is,

1358
00:38:57,770 --> 00:38:58,670
this is a strategy.

1359
00:38:58,671 --> 00:39:00,030
Just go backwards for a while.

1360
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:05,320
Well she so scrappy man and she's so fit
and she's constantly thrown down with

1361
00:39:05,391 --> 00:39:06,650
bad ass dudes.

1362
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,071
Well,

1363
00:39:07,071 --> 00:39:08,840
so is Beck Rawlings,

1364
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:12,590
but like Paige is one of
those Alpha male athletes.

1365
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:17,770
So she's at a team Alpha male with
Uriah Faber and Chad Mendez and Cody

1366
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:24,250
Garbrandt and there's a ton of savages
and Justin Buchholz who's the the trainer

1367
00:39:24,411 --> 00:39:26,090
there now who's one of
the trainers there now.

1368
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,640
And I think Justin is
still fighting to keep,

1369
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:33,110
imagine how big pages a MMA
and fitness academy would be.

1370
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:34,123
Good Lord.

1371
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,300
Alpha female.

1372
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:36,763
Good Lord.

1373
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:38,220
Okay.

1374
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:38,461
Yeah.

1375
00:39:38,461 --> 00:39:42,830
Just have a bunch of bad ass bitches
smacking people and that then brings him

1376
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:45,480
the dude's and then that brings
in the dude's and it's like a,

1377
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:47,820
it's like a nightclub after awhile.

1378
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,173
Soon as you walk in,

1379
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:53,013
there's no light,

1380
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:57,420
just strobe light working
out to a strobe light.

1381
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:57,981
Can you imagine?

1382
00:39:57,981 --> 00:39:58,540
No one.

1383
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:58,710
Oh,

1384
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:00,930
and there's mirrors everywhere
and strobes going off.

1385
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,610
Go go dancers.

1386
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,240
A shot girl.

1387
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:08,180
Maybe that's what she imagined.

1388
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:09,540
That's what Bellah toward.

1389
00:40:09,541 --> 00:40:10,980
Does they just go,

1390
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:13,140
did you go straight strip club?

1391
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:14,760
What do you mean Bela Tarr.

1392
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:16,330
If Bella door decided to,

1393
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:17,230
oh my God.

1394
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:18,000
The shows.

1395
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,833
Yeah,

1396
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:19,740
in the dark.

1397
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:20,530
Yeah.

1398
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:24,690
Without the fighter's got a fight with
like flashing lights and competing with

1399
00:40:24,691 --> 00:40:25,524
them May.

1400
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:27,690
It's just too hard to catch up to the UFC.

1401
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:30,090
So what we're gonna do
is obscure the lighting.

1402
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,380
We're going to make it a,

1403
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:32,610
everyone's going to wear neon.

1404
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,430
You're going to be hard.

1405
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:38,430
They do have to do like neon around the
risks so that you know we're going to do

1406
00:40:39,031 --> 00:40:39,864
a special no.

1407
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:41,243
Oh,

1408
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:43,380
jumping roundhouse kicked in the face.

1409
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,760
Oh Shit.

1410
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:47,160
Oh Shit.

1411
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:49,140
Oh my goodness.

1412
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:50,190
What a kick.

1413
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,010
Okay,

1414
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:53,330
Dang God.

1415
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:54,920
Out of nowhere.

1416
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:55,820
Damn.

1417
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,140
That was incredible.

1418
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,180
And then she just fucking swarmed on.

1419
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:03,730
She's a tough girl,

1420
00:41:03,731 --> 00:41:04,300
man.

1421
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,530
That was a tough girl.

1422
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:09,040
That's the one that's going
to make the highlight.

1423
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:09,431
Oh,

1424
00:41:09,431 --> 00:41:10,181
for sure,

1425
00:41:10,181 --> 00:41:10,451
dude.

1426
00:41:10,451 --> 00:41:12,760
She jumping in roundhouse
kicked her in the face.

1427
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:14,860
Holy Shit.

1428
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:16,210
Okay.

1429
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:17,570
That was sensational.

1430
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:22,950
Maybe that was the plan
to get her to come in,

1431
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:23,640
get her,

1432
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,070
just keep her coming in.

1433
00:41:25,071 --> 00:41:25,611
Coming in,

1434
00:41:25,611 --> 00:41:26,444
coming in.

1435
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:27,440
Well,

1436
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,520
it looked like,

1437
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:29,031
you know,

1438
00:41:29,031 --> 00:41:30,260
she was having her moments,

1439
00:41:30,261 --> 00:41:34,610
but it looked like back Rawlings was
having an advantage over her and the

1440
00:41:34,611 --> 00:41:35,241
striking,

1441
00:41:35,241 --> 00:41:36,074
didn't you agree?

1442
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:37,131
Yes,

1443
00:41:37,131 --> 00:41:37,670
absolutely.

1444
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:38,240
But look at this.

1445
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,490
Oh,

1446
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,400
are you kidding me?

1447
00:41:40,401 --> 00:41:42,350
I don't think it has one other
lenders like that before.

1448
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,420
That's not the first one is a guy here.

1449
00:41:44,421 --> 00:41:47,930
Rodriguez landed on Andrew
feeling exactly like,

1450
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:48,350
Ooh.

1451
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:48,651
Yeah,

1452
00:41:48,651 --> 00:41:49,484
real similar.

1453
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:51,470
I think it was the same leg too.

1454
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:52,311
God Damn,

1455
00:41:52,311 --> 00:41:53,180
that was amazing.

1456
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,240
That's a sweet DDC.

1457
00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:59,680
See how she was holding her scrub right
here with their left hand up so she

1458
00:41:59,681 --> 00:42:00,371
couldn't run away?

1459
00:42:00,371 --> 00:42:01,204
Yes.

1460
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,140
Look at this shit.

1461
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:03,960
Oh Shit.

1462
00:42:03,961 --> 00:42:05,140
Oh my goodness.

1463
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,210
Check out the end where she's
punching her at the end.

1464
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:09,190
How she's holding her or her hand.

1465
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:09,710
Oh.

1466
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:10,690
Oh my God.

1467
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:11,583
Look at,

1468
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:13,360
that's beautiful man.

1469
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,033
Man.

1470
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:16,210
That is beautiful.

1471
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:17,590
Great.

1472
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:18,730
What technique?

1473
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:19,540
Very nice.

1474
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:21,040
And when you're an athlete like her,

1475
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:22,270
like a dancer like that,

1476
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:23,830
that girl can spring.

1477
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:26,873
Wow.

1478
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,070
People are going to start doing salsa now.

1479
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:29,993
Damn.

1480
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,010
That's a tough girl.

1481
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:33,323
It's crazy.

1482
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:36,811
There she is.

1483
00:42:36,811 --> 00:42:37,560
Holy Shit.

1484
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:40,350
She's a day or the never bigger than ever.

1485
00:42:40,351 --> 00:42:40,890
Boom.

1486
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:41,640
Bam.

1487
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:42,000
Well,

1488
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:42,391
I mean,

1489
00:42:42,391 --> 00:42:43,171
come on man.

1490
00:42:43,171 --> 00:42:43,470
She's,

1491
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:44,790
it's like 23 years old.

1492
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,000
Shit.

1493
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,550
25 year old professional ass kicker.

1494
00:42:47,551 --> 00:42:48,001
Slash.

1495
00:42:48,001 --> 00:42:48,834
Dancer.

1496
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:53,310
Was she a dancer before?

1497
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:53,731
Yeah,

1498
00:42:53,731 --> 00:42:54,690
they're dancing with the stars.

1499
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:55,980
Here's Yoyo Rodriguez.

1500
00:42:57,090 --> 00:42:58,280
Damn Jamie.

1501
00:42:58,800 --> 00:42:59,290
Jamie's a,

1502
00:42:59,290 --> 00:42:59,880
you're looking at this.

1503
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:00,391
There it is.

1504
00:43:00,391 --> 00:43:01,320
Same exact kit.

1505
00:43:01,321 --> 00:43:02,154
Yeah,

1506
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:03,340
that's,

1507
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:06,240
that's the Jackie Chan realm.

1508
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,010
That's taekwondo.

1509
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:09,751
People get mad.

1510
00:43:09,751 --> 00:43:10,584
I say it wrong.

1511
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:13,680
That's almost like a one,

1512
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:13,980
two,

1513
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:14,460
right?

1514
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:15,400
It's almost like a wow.

1515
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:16,320
Yeah.

1516
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,160
Well it's um,

1517
00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:19,830
except it's round instead of
like that front snap kick.

1518
00:43:19,831 --> 00:43:20,070
Right.

1519
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:21,210
But some Kyokushin guys,

1520
00:43:21,211 --> 00:43:21,841
you still like that?

1521
00:43:21,841 --> 00:43:25,410
It's just basically a traditional
sort of a karate style.

1522
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:26,780
One's ones around kick,

1523
00:43:26,781 --> 00:43:26,881
right.

1524
00:43:26,881 --> 00:43:29,160
It could be that or it
could be double round kick.

1525
00:43:29,161 --> 00:43:31,950
You could like throw the first
one just trying to touch.

1526
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:34,950
You're not really trying to get all the
power and it just trying to just touch

1527
00:43:34,951 --> 00:43:38,400
it so you could brace off of it and
then switch the hips over and throw that

1528
00:43:38,401 --> 00:43:39,060
second one.

1529
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:42,520
You see me doing a bag before
you got to do a DVD of her.

1530
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:44,640
You're fucking kicks to come home with a w

1531
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:50,190
and then just put it away for free
and just give it away for a dollar.

1532
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:55,850
The only thing that I think that shouldn't
be an instructional online is uh,

1533
00:43:56,700 --> 00:44:01,380
how to correctly throw that turning
sidekick to get power in it.

1534
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:05,160
There's this almost should be
like an instruction on that.

1535
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:06,150
You should make it.

1536
00:44:06,330 --> 00:44:06,661
Yeah.

1537
00:44:06,661 --> 00:44:07,111
Well you know,

1538
00:44:07,111 --> 00:44:07,921
I wish there was this guy,

1539
00:44:07,921 --> 00:44:08,340
I don't think,

1540
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:10,140
well you kind of did that GSP kick.

1541
00:44:10,141 --> 00:44:12,530
I mean that helped a little
was an instructional yeah.

1542
00:44:12,570 --> 00:44:14,370
He basically got all your points out.

1543
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,600
It was five minutes or something,

1544
00:44:15,601 --> 00:44:15,760
right?

1545
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:16,590
Yeah,

1546
00:44:16,590 --> 00:44:17,460
there could be,

1547
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:22,260
you could do it the way you would teach
him and GSP you would do it the way you

1548
00:44:22,261 --> 00:44:22,951
would teach someone.

1549
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:24,090
You would break it down.

1550
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:24,400
So,

1551
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,720
cause I think like a lot of
it is that people are missing,

1552
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,390
they're missing like one aspect of it did.

1553
00:44:30,391 --> 00:44:31,140
They just don't.

1554
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:31,770
Right.

1555
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:31,980
And they

1556
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:35,670
put the other stuff together and it just
doesn't work correctly because of it.

1557
00:44:35,671 --> 00:44:36,031
And that,

1558
00:44:36,031 --> 00:44:39,580
that aspect is that sidekick is like
getting the knee out for the regular side

1559
00:44:39,581 --> 00:44:41,400
kick and then extending the body.

1560
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:42,181
That's where all the,

1561
00:44:42,181 --> 00:44:44,940
like the efficiency and the
torque and the power is.

1562
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:48,810
Isn't it crazy that something as simple
as the turning side kick or just the

1563
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:49,860
regular sidekick?

1564
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,270
It's so simple.

1565
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:52,630
Everybody knows what it is.

1566
00:44:52,631 --> 00:44:56,250
It's sidekick is like probably
one of the most popular kicking,

1567
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:57,540
kicking names,

1568
00:44:57,570 --> 00:44:57,901
you know,

1569
00:44:57,901 --> 00:45:02,190
and yet very few people on the
planet and know how to throw it.

1570
00:45:02,191 --> 00:45:02,850
Right.

1571
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:05,100
Especially like an MMA and the UFC.

1572
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:07,170
How many guys throw it right?

1573
00:45:07,290 --> 00:45:07,741
Would you say?

1574
00:45:07,741 --> 00:45:08,730
Ten five.

1575
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:09,720
It's hard.

1576
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:13,020
It's hard to say because a lot of them
don't do it when they're fighting.

1577
00:45:13,021 --> 00:45:14,610
It's not a common technique,

1578
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,560
but Wonderboy does it perfect.

1579
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:17,760
Really with power and everywhere.

1580
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:18,180
Yeah.

1581
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:19,530
I wonder what kind of power.

1582
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:20,021
Oh yeah,

1583
00:45:20,021 --> 00:45:20,221
yeah,

1584
00:45:20,221 --> 00:45:20,640
yeah.

1585
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:25,640
Well wonder boy when he fights he keeps
you at the very end cause he's real tall

1586
00:45:26,491 --> 00:45:26,890
and long.

1587
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:30,660
He's got a very specific sort of
style and that style is like this.

1588
00:45:30,810 --> 00:45:35,370
Like he's like he's got you and when
you're moving in on him he's like angles

1589
00:45:35,371 --> 00:45:36,330
and shots.

1590
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:36,920
He,

1591
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,580
he's angles and counters.

1592
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:39,900
He'll catch you with that front,

1593
00:45:39,901 --> 00:45:41,130
right front leg side kick.

1594
00:45:41,131 --> 00:45:44,640
And then if you respond to it he'll go
like he's going to do to it and then hit

1595
00:45:44,641 --> 00:45:46,500
you in the face with a
roundhouse kick instead.

1596
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:47,910
He did that to Johnny Hendricks.

1597
00:45:48,090 --> 00:45:51,490
He front leg side kicked him in
the body and like hard indeed.

1598
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:53,880
You see Hendricks gets
jarred just a little boom.

1599
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:55,500
It was a jab,

1600
00:45:55,501 --> 00:45:56,161
it was a fucking,

1601
00:45:56,161 --> 00:45:57,200
he thrusted in there,

1602
00:45:57,450 --> 00:46:02,340
a powerful front leg side kick and you
see Hendrix try to move forward again,

1603
00:46:02,370 --> 00:46:03,900
like to settle in again and boom,

1604
00:46:03,901 --> 00:46:05,340
he pops in with the same leg,

1605
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:07,730
hits him with the front
leg round kick in the face.

1606
00:46:09,970 --> 00:46:10,200
Yeah,

1607
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,960
it was like boosh and then there was
like a little bit of a movement and then

1608
00:46:12,961 --> 00:46:13,381
boom,

1609
00:46:13,381 --> 00:46:14,190
the round kick him.

1610
00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:15,420
See that you can find that.

1611
00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:16,800
It was like a,

1612
00:46:16,801 --> 00:46:18,120
when Hendrix stopped,

1613
00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:18,991
uh,

1614
00:46:18,991 --> 00:46:19,561
or excuse me,

1615
00:46:19,561 --> 00:46:20,850
when I'm a,

1616
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:24,540
Wonderboy stopped Hendricks and
he stomped him the first round,

1617
00:46:24,541 --> 00:46:25,470
which was insane.

1618
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:26,101
You know,

1619
00:46:26,101 --> 00:46:31,101
you think that how fucking durable
Hendricks is Hendrick's is an animal.

1620
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:33,810
You could stop that
guy in the first round.

1621
00:46:34,050 --> 00:46:37,260
That's something that's
something incredibly impressive.

1622
00:46:38,650 --> 00:46:39,331
You know what I mean?

1623
00:46:39,331 --> 00:46:43,540
You think of the Hendrix that went five
fucking crazy rounds with Robbie Lawler,

1624
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,690
former Bachelorette.

1625
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:48,520
Fuck is that,

1626
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:48,630
oh,

1627
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:49,361
it's a bachelorette.

1628
00:46:49,361 --> 00:46:51,060
I don't know how to show
what's going on here.

1629
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:57,460
Former bachelor at Vancouver Canucks to
take their hockey seriously up there.

1630
00:46:58,200 --> 00:46:58,681
How about that?

1631
00:46:58,681 --> 00:46:59,910
They're allowed to punch each other.

1632
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:00,990
Their sport.

1633
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:02,640
They're allowed to beat
the fuck out of each other.

1634
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:04,613
They just dropped it.

1635
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:07,470
They dropped their gloves and
they go knuckle the knuckle.

1636
00:47:07,471 --> 00:47:11,670
It's the only time you're allowed to go
knuckle to knuckle with somebody on TV.

1637
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:14,670
You can't go knuckle to knuckle
with anybody in the UFC fight.

1638
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,110
They make you take your gloves.

1639
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:16,680
They,

1640
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:17,850
you have your hand wraps,

1641
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:18,810
you put your gloves on,

1642
00:47:18,811 --> 00:47:19,890
you have to have gloves on.

1643
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:22,050
Did you know you don't
have to have hand wraps.

1644
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:25,020
I want to see ultimate
knockouts in hockey.

1645
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:27,350
There's gotta be a highlight video here.

1646
00:47:27,370 --> 00:47:31,240
It is back up before this
cause he does is before this.

1647
00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:32,823
He catches him.

1648
00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:33,351
I was this the,

1649
00:47:33,351 --> 00:47:33,530
the,

1650
00:47:33,530 --> 00:47:35,630
the combination and ends the fight now.

1651
00:47:35,631 --> 00:47:36,040
It was it,

1652
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:38,350
I'm sorry it was before
earlier in the round.

1653
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:40,090
It was like when they were
feeling each other out,

1654
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:41,890
like Thompson just
starts putting it to him.

1655
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:43,000
Do that turn in psychic.

1656
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,340
He threw right there with five.

1657
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:46,480
Jet Does is legit.

1658
00:47:46,510 --> 00:47:47,710
He does everything perfect.

1659
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:48,633
Is He the best striker?

1660
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:49,473
Another may right now.

1661
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:52,060
Maybe Michael Page is up there too.

1662
00:47:52,590 --> 00:47:55,630
I want to see Michael Page
fight a higher caliber.

1663
00:47:55,631 --> 00:47:56,081
A fighter.

1664
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:56,950
But that guys,

1665
00:47:58,060 --> 00:47:58,600
look man,

1666
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,910
he broke cyborgs head.

1667
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:02,253
Yeah.

1668
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:03,580
Cyborg evangelists.

1669
00:48:03,581 --> 00:48:07,690
Sta who's a longtime veteran and
a guy's been fighting forever.

1670
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:08,621
Tough,

1671
00:48:08,621 --> 00:48:13,330
tough guy and venom page broke
his head with a flying knee.

1672
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:14,830
He's a high level striker.

1673
00:48:14,831 --> 00:48:16,390
We just don't know how high level,

1674
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:17,020
you know,

1675
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:17,853
I want to see him.

1676
00:48:18,370 --> 00:48:19,000
But uh,

1677
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,960
as far as the UFC Wonderboy,

1678
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:22,330
he's one of the best for sure.

1679
00:48:22,331 --> 00:48:23,220
But you know,

1680
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:24,220
it's hard to say.

1681
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:27,280
Anybody is scarier right now than rumble.

1682
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:29,080
Who's scary than Rumble Johnson?

1683
00:48:29,081 --> 00:48:29,770
Nobody.

1684
00:48:29,770 --> 00:48:30,603
Nobody.

1685
00:48:30,770 --> 00:48:31,171
Grumbled.

1686
00:48:31,171 --> 00:48:32,080
Johnson is like,

1687
00:48:32,290 --> 00:48:32,411
oh,

1688
00:48:32,411 --> 00:48:33,160
here it is.

1689
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:33,700
You got it.

1690
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:34,533
Jamie found it.

1691
00:48:36,010 --> 00:48:36,281
No,

1692
00:48:36,281 --> 00:48:36,851
back it up.

1693
00:48:36,851 --> 00:48:38,530
That's the same exact combination.

1694
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:41,261
But he did.

1695
00:48:41,261 --> 00:48:42,970
He land that turned
inside kick right there.

1696
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:43,601
Uh,

1697
00:48:43,601 --> 00:48:45,160
he hit him like in the chest,

1698
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:45,551
but he was,

1699
00:48:45,551 --> 00:48:46,000
you know,

1700
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:46,750
that's,

1701
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:47,471
he's here.

1702
00:48:47,471 --> 00:48:47,711
It is.

1703
00:48:47,711 --> 00:48:50,920
I think he catches him with
some weird stuff coming in,

1704
00:48:50,921 --> 00:48:51,131
man.

1705
00:48:51,131 --> 00:48:52,120
It's really interesting.

1706
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:53,980
Like they have this little combination.

1707
00:48:55,510 --> 00:48:58,000
He throws that round
cake out of nowhere too.

1708
00:48:58,540 --> 00:48:59,830
He's real good at the ending.

1709
00:48:59,831 --> 00:49:02,830
Those combinations with round
cakes where people don't expect it.

1710
00:49:03,130 --> 00:49:04,450
It comes in fast.

1711
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:05,620
See tags him there.

1712
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:06,513
Oh Shit.

1713
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:07,960
So I must've been before that.

1714
00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:10,503
This is the follow up.

1715
00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:11,800
This is the final combination.

1716
00:49:11,801 --> 00:49:12,970
What round did he stop him?

1717
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:14,320
Stop Him in the first.

1718
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:15,130
Wow.

1719
00:49:15,130 --> 00:49:15,311
Yeah.

1720
00:49:15,311 --> 00:49:16,810
We go watch the whole first round man.

1721
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:17,290
Yeah.

1722
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:17,471
Yeah.

1723
00:49:17,471 --> 00:49:18,640
Let's watch the whole first round.

1724
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:19,780
See if he could find it.

1725
00:49:19,781 --> 00:49:21,190
He overwhelmed him.

1726
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:21,491
Yeah.

1727
00:49:21,491 --> 00:49:22,750
This is a how it sets up.

1728
00:49:22,870 --> 00:49:24,040
Why is it all like weird?

1729
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:25,180
Eh,

1730
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:26,710
it's not supposed to
be on youtube here to,

1731
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:31,750
so like he also gets away with
keeping his hands down like that.

1732
00:49:31,990 --> 00:49:32,171
Okay.

1733
00:49:32,171 --> 00:49:33,430
He tried that shit right there,

1734
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,140
that jumping roundhouse kick.

1735
00:49:36,490 --> 00:49:41,490
He gets away with shit because of his
distance and his understanding of like

1736
00:49:41,921 --> 00:49:44,470
space is so high level.

1737
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:46,720
He's understanding of like striking space.

1738
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:47,950
So God damn good.

1739
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:49,930
And he was really smart.

1740
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:53,800
He went right to Chris Weidman would
use like I got to learn how to wrestle.

1741
00:49:53,830 --> 00:49:57,130
I'm just going to fucking become buddies
with one of the toughest wrestlers and

1742
00:49:57,131 --> 00:50:00,850
MMA and I'm going to train like an
animal with a guy who could beat my ass.

1743
00:50:01,390 --> 00:50:02,223
That's the move.

1744
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:02,920
You know,

1745
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:03,753
look what happened.

1746
00:50:03,890 --> 00:50:04,990
He's the top contender.

1747
00:50:05,770 --> 00:50:06,561
We'll get a say what I,

1748
00:50:06,561 --> 00:50:11,561
what would you recommend till UFC
fighter or like a new guy on the ultimate

1749
00:50:11,681 --> 00:50:14,350
fighter show when you got
these young guys coming in,

1750
00:50:14,351 --> 00:50:17,860
would you ever recommend they
take a taekwondo classes?

1751
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:19,660
It's not a bad thing to do,

1752
00:50:19,661 --> 00:50:24,520
but the problem is if you're in the
middle of learning how to fight,

1753
00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:27,160
you might want to concentrate on,

1754
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:28,160
I mean if you're going to compete,

1755
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:32,930
it's almost like you might
want to concentrate on those
other aspects before you

1756
00:50:32,931 --> 00:50:33,860
really attempt it.

1757
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:36,440
You hope you might want to concentrate,

1758
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:40,970
you'd have to talk to like a guy who was
tragically training guys and is really

1759
00:50:40,971 --> 00:50:45,110
aware of how much resources you actually
have as far as like how hard you can

1760
00:50:45,111 --> 00:50:46,250
train and stuff.

1761
00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:46,851
You know,

1762
00:50:46,851 --> 00:50:48,530
because if you're training
two or three times a day,

1763
00:50:48,531 --> 00:50:49,640
which a lot of these guys are,

1764
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:50,331
you know,

1765
00:50:50,331 --> 00:50:54,890
you're probably already dedicated
to like strength and conditioning,

1766
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:55,940
Jujitsu class,

1767
00:50:55,950 --> 00:50:59,420
you're seeing like maybe the
style that Wonderboy has,

1768
00:50:59,570 --> 00:51:01,370
maybe that's a glimpse of the future.

1769
00:51:01,371 --> 00:51:03,590
Like everybody got to
get on this eventually.

1770
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:05,870
So if you tell a guy who
was just getting in to it,

1771
00:51:05,871 --> 00:51:06,231
you know what,

1772
00:51:06,231 --> 00:51:09,470
stick to the basic stick to
Moitai or you could do that later.

1773
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:10,760
He won't get into it later.

1774
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:11,001
You know,

1775
00:51:11,001 --> 00:51:12,770
you gotta do it like yesterday.

1776
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:14,210
You want to get right on it.

1777
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,740
But here's the deal.

1778
00:51:15,770 --> 00:51:17,780
When someone's not good at that stuff,

1779
00:51:17,810 --> 00:51:19,160
it's easy to exploit.

1780
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:20,413
So there's,

1781
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:23,330
there's a learning curve
where you have to go,

1782
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:26,990
you have to cross over a
certain level of expertise.

1783
00:51:26,991 --> 00:51:31,350
We understand striking when you understand
like what errors to make and like

1784
00:51:31,490 --> 00:51:33,200
where to put momentum into things.

1785
00:51:33,530 --> 00:51:36,260
And when you're learning
like certain kinds of kicks,

1786
00:51:36,590 --> 00:51:37,970
like they're awkward,

1787
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,440
especially if you're not that flexible.

1788
00:51:39,441 --> 00:51:40,280
You're not used to it.

1789
00:51:40,281 --> 00:51:41,330
You haven't done it before.

1790
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:42,950
You tried it in an MMA fight,

1791
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:44,090
it could be a problem.

1792
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:45,960
But if you're a guy like Wonderboy,

1793
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:48,170
he's learned how to do
it since he was a kid.

1794
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:51,990
I mean Wonderboy has been doing karate
with his dad since he was a kid.

1795
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:52,550
Yeah.

1796
00:51:52,550 --> 00:51:53,690
So like he's,

1797
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:55,250
he's a goddamn wizard.

1798
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:56,930
I mean he was,

1799
00:51:57,110 --> 00:52:02,110
he had some insane record of 50 something
wins and kickboxing with no losses.

1800
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:04,311
You know,

1801
00:52:04,311 --> 00:52:07,470
he used to fight on that Chuck
Norris World Combat League.

1802
00:52:07,471 --> 00:52:08,300
You remember that?

1803
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:09,860
Didn't we go to see him live once,

1804
00:52:09,861 --> 00:52:10,161
man?

1805
00:52:10,161 --> 00:52:10,520
Yeah.

1806
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:10,781
Yeah.

1807
00:52:10,781 --> 00:52:12,860
We saw it was like
Atlantic city or something.

1808
00:52:12,861 --> 00:52:13,970
I don't remember where it was.

1809
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:14,833
Where the hell was it?

1810
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:16,460
I don't know.

1811
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:17,300
But we went to see it.

1812
00:52:17,301 --> 00:52:19,340
I hugged Chuck Norris for the first time.

1813
00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:20,270
I've hugged him since,

1814
00:52:20,271 --> 00:52:21,800
but remember that,

1815
00:52:21,801 --> 00:52:22,560
uh,

1816
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:23,720
the greatest moments in my life,

1817
00:52:23,721 --> 00:52:24,200
man,

1818
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:25,880
it was a UFC fighter on that show.

1819
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:27,110
I'm not bullshitting either.

1820
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:29,210
Remember there was a UFC
fighter on that show.

1821
00:52:29,510 --> 00:52:31,220
A black guy who fought in the UFC.

1822
00:52:31,221 --> 00:52:31,580
Who did,

1823
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:32,960
who did that Shell as well?

1824
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:34,370
He's from Texas.

1825
00:52:34,371 --> 00:52:35,170
I forget his name.

1826
00:52:35,170 --> 00:52:36,003
Damn it.

1827
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:36,650
Uh,

1828
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:37,790
he's a rapper too.

1829
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:39,770
He's a rapper.

1830
00:52:39,771 --> 00:52:40,910
Fought in the UFC.

1831
00:52:41,090 --> 00:52:44,930
I think he got into rap after the
UFC and then he followed that show.

1832
00:52:45,170 --> 00:52:45,891
Fuck.

1833
00:52:45,891 --> 00:52:46,670
I forget his name.

1834
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:47,180
Dammit.

1835
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:48,050
From Texas.

1836
00:52:48,110 --> 00:52:48,943
Shit.

1837
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:51,330
See Jamie,

1838
00:52:51,331 --> 00:52:52,164
you'll find them.

1839
00:52:52,190 --> 00:52:53,023
What is it?

1840
00:52:53,630 --> 00:52:55,280
I didn't give him moral combat league.

1841
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:55,821
Yeah,

1842
00:52:55,821 --> 00:52:56,654
you fucked it up.

1843
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,690
God Damn it was his name.

1844
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:01,370
That world combat league was dope.

1845
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:02,983
I enjoyed it.

1846
00:53:03,470 --> 00:53:04,303
It's not,

1847
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:04,731
you know,

1848
00:53:04,731 --> 00:53:05,330
um,

1849
00:53:05,330 --> 00:53:07,740
it's not a bad idea to,

1850
00:53:07,741 --> 00:53:08,330
um,

1851
00:53:08,330 --> 00:53:09,350
have a,

1852
00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:10,340
a surface,

1853
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,800
almost like a mini
swimming pool type thing.

1854
00:53:12,830 --> 00:53:13,690
The way they had it,

1855
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:15,230
where there's an outside edge.

1856
00:53:15,290 --> 00:53:19,730
There's nothing wrong with having
a tournament based on just kicking,

1857
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:20,241
which is,

1858
00:53:20,241 --> 00:53:21,650
it's going to be just the best kickers.

1859
00:53:21,651 --> 00:53:21,981
That's it.

1860
00:53:21,981 --> 00:53:23,390
We're not going to
really bring in striking.

1861
00:53:23,391 --> 00:53:24,350
You can't strike well,

1862
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:25,980
you can kick anywhere you want or

1863
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:27,960
something like that or like whatever.

1864
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:28,561
You know what I mean?

1865
00:53:28,561 --> 00:53:29,394
Like soccer,

1866
00:53:29,430 --> 00:53:31,370
something just to spend it with Tyco.

1867
00:53:31,550 --> 00:53:35,010
It's like of wrestling is
just one tiny aspect of MMA.

1868
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:36,570
The take down in the,

1869
00:53:36,571 --> 00:53:37,710
you know the base.

1870
00:53:37,770 --> 00:53:38,461
It's not tiny.

1871
00:53:38,461 --> 00:53:39,450
Let me rephrase that.

1872
00:53:39,451 --> 00:53:40,760
It's a big part of that in the May,

1873
00:53:40,761 --> 00:53:42,960
but it's just one of the big three,

1874
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:44,840
the big three being striking,

1875
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:47,250
a wrestling and Jujitsu.

1876
00:53:47,251 --> 00:53:52,230
But then there's also samba with Jujitsu
and ins takedowns there's judo with

1877
00:53:52,231 --> 00:53:54,570
wrestling and then in
striking there's Moyie,

1878
00:53:54,571 --> 00:53:56,130
Thai boxing,

1879
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,690
traditional martial arts,

1880
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:58,141
you know,

1881
00:53:58,141 --> 00:53:59,940
but it's generally the big three.

1882
00:53:59,941 --> 00:54:01,470
And then there's like sisters and shit.

1883
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:05,400
But here's my thoughts on the
taekwondo and Moy Tai thing.

1884
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:06,031
I'm like,

1885
00:54:06,031 --> 00:54:08,790
you cannot get taekwondo off.

1886
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:11,090
It's not going to work
if you don't know Moitai.

1887
00:54:11,130 --> 00:54:12,000
That's what I believe.

1888
00:54:12,390 --> 00:54:17,390
I believe that most Moitai
cancels taekwondo and this
is from me doing taekwondo

1889
00:54:18,901 --> 00:54:23,550
most of my younger life and then doing
Muay Thai and then seeing like the holes

1890
00:54:23,551 --> 00:54:24,384
in it.

1891
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:25,560
Like if you don't know it,

1892
00:54:25,561 --> 00:54:27,030
like if you ever watched
like a taekwondo guy,

1893
00:54:27,031 --> 00:54:28,210
there's a few of them online.

1894
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:29,940
What were no guys fight
Muay Thai guys took,

1895
00:54:29,950 --> 00:54:30,960
it will get lit up.

1896
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:36,380
It's like it's like a Molly tie his leg
locks and boxing is a Brazilian Jujitsu.

1897
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:42,630
Boxing is very important and
an inanimate very important,

1898
00:54:42,930 --> 00:54:44,100
but if you don't know [inaudible],

1899
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:45,180
you don't know how to check kicks,

1900
00:54:45,181 --> 00:54:46,440
you're going to get exposed.

1901
00:54:46,441 --> 00:54:47,290
They're going to kick your leg.

1902
00:54:47,291 --> 00:54:51,030
Same thing if you know Bjj
and you don't know leg locks,

1903
00:54:51,990 --> 00:54:53,400
I see it all the time.

1904
00:54:53,401 --> 00:54:53,910
If you're going,

1905
00:54:53,910 --> 00:54:57,960
if you're a traditional Brazilian Jujitsu
guy who didn't get heavy on leg locks

1906
00:54:57,961 --> 00:55:00,270
and you go against a guy
who's heavy on leg lots,

1907
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,970
you could take a guy that's been
doing leg locks for one year,

1908
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:04,020
maybe two years,

1909
00:55:04,021 --> 00:55:05,590
and he just focuses on leg locks.

1910
00:55:05,690 --> 00:55:07,950
He see when you're
really good at leg locks,

1911
00:55:08,310 --> 00:55:09,510
you don't have to pass the guard.

1912
00:55:09,511 --> 00:55:12,660
You don't have to sweep
ever with pro tradition,

1913
00:55:12,690 --> 00:55:13,590
traditional Jujitsu,

1914
00:55:13,591 --> 00:55:15,270
just straight chokes and armbars.

1915
00:55:15,630 --> 00:55:16,710
You have to pass the guy.

1916
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:17,970
That goddamn guard.

1917
00:55:17,971 --> 00:55:22,380
Generally if you're on top to get any
close to any submissions or you've got to

1918
00:55:22,381 --> 00:55:23,100
sweep,

1919
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:24,150
but we'd leg locks.

1920
00:55:24,330 --> 00:55:25,830
You don't have to do shit.

1921
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:26,341
Oh,

1922
00:55:26,341 --> 00:55:26,471
you know,

1923
00:55:26,471 --> 00:55:29,580
you can go right into
leg locks from anywhere.

1924
00:55:30,210 --> 00:55:30,511
You know?

1925
00:55:30,511 --> 00:55:32,400
That's the beautiful
thing about leg locks.

1926
00:55:32,401 --> 00:55:37,401
When you add that to Jujitsu combined
sambo catch wrestling and Brazilian

1927
00:55:38,530 --> 00:55:39,210
Jujitsu,

1928
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:39,840
boom.

1929
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:41,340
That right there is huge.

1930
00:55:41,341 --> 00:55:43,530
It's just like combining
Moyie Thai and boxing.

1931
00:55:43,830 --> 00:55:45,300
That's fucking huge.

1932
00:55:45,301 --> 00:55:46,650
Combining Muay Thai and boxing.

1933
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:48,570
Boxing by itself an MMA,

1934
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:50,250
you're going to get your legs kicked.

1935
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:51,010
Well

1936
00:55:51,010 --> 00:55:51,610
he does.

1937
00:55:51,610 --> 00:55:53,590
Do you think that it is important,

1938
00:55:53,591 --> 00:55:55,660
like if you were trying to
develop a perfect fighter,

1939
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:59,440
do you think that it's important to start
out with one discipline and get really

1940
00:55:59,441 --> 00:56:00,011
good at it?

1941
00:56:00,011 --> 00:56:05,011
Like Damien Maia or do you think you
should be a guy or a gal who learns

1942
00:56:05,351 --> 00:56:06,170
everything

1943
00:56:06,170 --> 00:56:07,010
from scratch?

1944
00:56:07,070 --> 00:56:07,790
Like it all depends.

1945
00:56:07,790 --> 00:56:09,320
When you start and what your,

1946
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:10,340
is,

1947
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:13,580
is your goal to becoming UFC champion?

1948
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:14,570
You want to be the name.

1949
00:56:14,570 --> 00:56:17,410
How old is van Zandt and how old are you?

1950
00:56:18,450 --> 00:56:18,940
Ah,

1951
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:19,691
that's a good question,

1952
00:56:19,691 --> 00:56:19,961
right?

1953
00:56:19,961 --> 00:56:21,040
There's no one answer,

1954
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:21,910
right?

1955
00:56:21,910 --> 00:56:22,181
Yeah.

1956
00:56:22,181 --> 00:56:22,420
If there,

1957
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:23,253
if someone's,

1958
00:56:23,350 --> 00:56:24,070
it's a big difference

1959
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:25,390
between that and you're a kid.

1960
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:28,600
I would say we've talked to this,

1961
00:56:28,630 --> 00:56:29,650
we've talked about this before.

1962
00:56:29,651 --> 00:56:32,710
I would say get into break
dancing and wrestling.

1963
00:56:33,150 --> 00:56:33,610
Uh,

1964
00:56:33,610 --> 00:56:34,443
Ma,

1965
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:35,920
put do that together,

1966
00:56:36,010 --> 00:56:36,581
break dance,

1967
00:56:36,581 --> 00:56:41,050
can rest and get into that heart and
do Jujitsu on Sundays or whatever,

1968
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:41,730
you know,

1969
00:56:41,730 --> 00:56:42,461
submissions here,

1970
00:56:42,461 --> 00:56:43,450
they'll pass the car here.

1971
00:56:43,630 --> 00:56:44,740
But make sure you,

1972
00:56:44,770 --> 00:56:48,730
you're putting enough time in that
wrestling and that breakdancing combining

1973
00:56:48,731 --> 00:56:52,930
both cause we all know
wrestling translates beautiful
beautifully into Jujitsu

1974
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:57,310
and now we know breakdancing
translates even better and to Jujitsu.

1975
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:58,180
And uh,

1976
00:56:58,180 --> 00:56:58,961
because you know,

1977
00:56:58,961 --> 00:56:59,980
when you're doing break dancing,

1978
00:56:59,981 --> 00:57:03,010
you're doing way more crazy
things and you are in wrestling.

1979
00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:03,973
Wrestling's nice,

1980
00:57:03,980 --> 00:57:04,421
simple,

1981
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:04,841
basic,

1982
00:57:04,841 --> 00:57:05,531
stay on top,

1983
00:57:05,531 --> 00:57:06,370
balanced base.

1984
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:07,181
Stay on top,

1985
00:57:07,181 --> 00:57:07,451
boom,

1986
00:57:07,451 --> 00:57:08,200
drive through,

1987
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:08,891
stay on top.

1988
00:57:08,891 --> 00:57:09,724
Don't let a guide,

1989
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:10,030
you know,

1990
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:11,080
get on top of you poem.

1991
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:14,620
You're not asking your body
to do these crazy maneuvers.

1992
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:15,600
I can break dancing and,

1993
00:57:15,730 --> 00:57:16,210
and when,

1994
00:57:16,210 --> 00:57:17,043
when you're used to doing,

1995
00:57:17,530 --> 00:57:21,700
when you're used to doing crazy shit
like spinning on your head in slow motion

1996
00:57:21,701 --> 00:57:22,534
and shit like that,

1997
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:27,940
the amount of control you have to have
on your core and the strength to do all

1998
00:57:28,301 --> 00:57:28,661
that shit.

1999
00:57:28,661 --> 00:57:29,170
It's like,

2000
00:57:29,170 --> 00:57:33,190
it's a crazy yoga Valera touch,

2001
00:57:33,191 --> 00:57:34,660
but all that shit,

2002
00:57:34,930 --> 00:57:39,280
all that shit combined into one cause
break dancing is fucking everything.

2003
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:40,121
It's like,

2004
00:57:40,121 --> 00:57:40,300
Gee,

2005
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:41,290
it's gymnastics,

2006
00:57:41,690 --> 00:57:42,280
it's,

2007
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:43,270
it's wrestling.

2008
00:57:43,390 --> 00:57:43,690
It's,

2009
00:57:43,690 --> 00:57:44,560
it's everything.

2010
00:57:44,561 --> 00:57:45,151
It's yoga,

2011
00:57:45,151 --> 00:57:46,160
it's policies,

2012
00:57:46,510 --> 00:57:47,660
it's flexibility.

2013
00:57:47,661 --> 00:57:48,610
Anything you can put,

2014
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:49,930
there's Graham bees in it,

2015
00:57:49,931 --> 00:57:51,300
there's rubber guard in it.

2016
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:53,020
There's all sorts of shit.

2017
00:57:53,021 --> 00:57:54,850
Breakdancing is endless,

2018
00:57:54,910 --> 00:57:58,030
so it just makes sense on paper.

2019
00:57:58,031 --> 00:58:02,200
It makes sense that that would be the
best thing to get your kids into a few,

2020
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:02,861
you know,

2021
00:58:02,861 --> 00:58:03,100
um,

2022
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:08,100
to develop the ultimate base balance
core strength that will translate into

2023
00:58:11,051 --> 00:58:11,560
anything.

2024
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:13,080
I've seen it over and over again with,

2025
00:58:13,090 --> 00:58:14,890
with GL and Boogie and all his guys.

2026
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:16,113
And uh,

2027
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:17,700
we got to shut off the break dancers.

2028
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:18,130
Good.

2029
00:58:18,130 --> 00:58:18,590
It's for,

2030
00:58:18,590 --> 00:58:19,091
for sure.

2031
00:58:19,091 --> 00:58:20,400
It's a good base for Jujitsu.

2032
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:21,393
I got another time.

2033
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,840
The question becomes though,

2034
00:58:22,870 --> 00:58:23,703
like what?

2035
00:58:24,010 --> 00:58:26,440
How much emphasis should
be put on striking?

2036
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:27,910
If you're developing a guy,

2037
00:58:28,190 --> 00:58:29,860
you're going to take
it from the beginning.

2038
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:31,000
I would say,

2039
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:32,200
uh,

2040
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:32,981
there's a lot of time,

2041
00:58:32,981 --> 00:58:37,240
I would say focus on the
wrestling and the breakdancing,

2042
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:39,370
Anglo striking here on the side.

2043
00:58:39,371 --> 00:58:40,360
Just get 'em moving.

2044
00:58:40,570 --> 00:58:42,280
Maybe taekwondo on Saturday,

2045
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:43,233
Jujitsu ons,

2046
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:44,111
taekwondo,

2047
00:58:44,111 --> 00:58:44,651
Saturday,

2048
00:58:44,651 --> 00:58:45,760
Jujitsu Sunday,

2049
00:58:45,970 --> 00:58:47,080
Monday through Friday,

2050
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,250
wrestling during the day,

2051
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:49,390
break dancing at night,

2052
00:58:49,510 --> 00:58:50,500
wrestling during the day,

2053
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:50,920
right?

2054
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:51,760
Five days a week.

2055
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:52,653
Saturday,

2056
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:53,291
God,

2057
00:58:53,291 --> 00:58:58,291
go to Mcdonald's and get a little
hot fudge Sundae after taekwondo.

2058
00:58:58,930 --> 00:58:59,711
Do all that shit.

2059
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:00,490
Boom.

2060
00:59:00,490 --> 00:59:01,323
And you're good.

2061
00:59:01,810 --> 00:59:02,141
Yeah,

2062
00:59:02,141 --> 00:59:02,471
man.

2063
00:59:02,471 --> 00:59:02,741
You know,

2064
00:59:02,741 --> 00:59:04,270
the only thing that I would wonder about,

2065
00:59:04,510 --> 00:59:07,300
I mean if you run into
a guy like Wonderboy,

2066
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:08,450
I'd wonder about it.

2067
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:09,693
Get it.

2068
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:11,990
When you look at a guy like wonder,

2069
00:59:11,991 --> 00:59:12,370
boy,

2070
00:59:12,370 --> 00:59:13,660
if you can't take that guy down,

2071
00:59:13,661 --> 00:59:14,650
you're kind of fucked.

2072
00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:16,480
Unless you're a better striker,

2073
00:59:16,550 --> 00:59:17,950
unless you're to wind off.

2074
00:59:18,210 --> 00:59:18,460
Yeah.

2075
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:19,060
You have to be.

2076
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:21,030
What's going to happen with
him and to banal question,

2077
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:21,950
it's a real good question.

2078
00:59:21,990 --> 00:59:24,890
[inaudible] he throws straight.

2079
00:59:25,010 --> 00:59:27,110
Powerful shit certainly does.

2080
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:30,140
He's super fluid,

2081
00:59:30,530 --> 00:59:31,550
very technical.

2082
00:59:31,580 --> 00:59:34,450
What does angles and the way
boxes his kicks are good too.

2083
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:35,660
Could good leg kicks.

2084
00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:36,730
It's an insane sport,

2085
00:59:36,731 --> 00:59:37,450
man.

2086
00:59:37,450 --> 00:59:38,740
So there's so many guys.

2087
00:59:39,250 --> 00:59:41,290
Look at the one 55 division,

2088
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:42,390
even just kill.

2089
00:59:42,391 --> 00:59:44,440
Imagine the shit talking.

2090
00:59:44,710 --> 00:59:45,130
Uh,

2091
00:59:45,130 --> 00:59:46,000
leading up to the fight,

2092
00:59:46,001 --> 00:59:46,781
the countdown show,

2093
00:59:46,781 --> 00:59:48,970
Tony Ferguson and Connor like even that,

2094
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:49,990
that's another,

2095
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:52,000
that's another dimension on its own.

2096
00:59:52,001 --> 00:59:53,260
Its own fuckings.

2097
00:59:53,490 --> 00:59:56,740
He will match that gives Nate Diaz and
Conor McGregor almost didn't fucking

2098
00:59:56,741 --> 00:59:57,340
happen.

2099
00:59:57,340 --> 00:59:58,270
This all this shed,

2100
00:59:58,271 --> 01:00:02,380
this historic shit of all time and
history almost didn't happen if,

2101
01:00:02,530 --> 01:00:04,000
if dos Anjos didn't get hurt,

2102
01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:04,893
right?

2103
01:00:04,990 --> 01:00:05,380
Right.

2104
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:06,160
Yeah.

2105
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:07,030
If he didn't get hurt,

2106
01:00:07,210 --> 01:00:08,350
we wouldn't have any of this shit.

2107
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:09,790
Dude.

2108
01:00:09,790 --> 01:00:11,170
Imagine Tony Ferguson,

2109
01:00:11,171 --> 01:00:12,040
Conor Mcgregor.

2110
01:00:12,310 --> 01:00:14,770
Imagine Dat Shit Cause Tony,

2111
01:00:15,010 --> 01:00:18,460
he's going to talk shit as
well and he's intelligent and

2112
01:00:19,990 --> 01:00:22,540
he's a full can total barbarian.

2113
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:24,050
He's holy Shit Dude.

2114
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:26,200
Dwayne's way to win the
way he put what the,

2115
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:28,240
the beating he put on Edson Barboza.

2116
01:00:28,241 --> 01:00:29,350
Holy Goddamn Shit.

2117
01:00:29,470 --> 01:00:34,300
Everybody's scared of Edson heads is one
of the scariest guys in UFC history at

2118
01:00:34,301 --> 01:00:35,410
the scary opponent.

2119
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:36,520
That's one guy who like,

2120
01:00:36,670 --> 01:00:37,091
you know what,

2121
01:00:37,091 --> 01:00:38,460
can we go around that motherfucker?

2122
01:00:38,530 --> 01:00:39,580
Let someone else find them.

2123
01:00:39,610 --> 01:00:40,200
You know?

2124
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:42,040
That's what deep down
everyone's thinking that.

2125
01:00:42,041 --> 01:00:42,670
Cause that guy,

2126
01:00:42,670 --> 01:00:44,620
if he lands a super fast,

2127
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:47,770
crazy spinning wheel kicks it.

2128
01:00:47,771 --> 01:00:48,850
He lands that shit.

2129
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:52,270
You might not be the same person
for the rest of your life.

2130
01:00:52,810 --> 01:00:54,280
There might be a slight change.

2131
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:55,510
He's a perfect example.

2132
01:00:55,511 --> 01:00:55,980
Example

2133
01:00:55,980 --> 01:00:57,810
of a guy who was outstanding,

2134
01:00:57,811 --> 01:01:02,470
Moy Tai and nasty traditional
kicks has perfect example.

2135
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:04,170
Do you ever see him throw
a spinning back kick?

2136
01:01:04,350 --> 01:01:04,590
Yes.

2137
01:01:04,590 --> 01:01:05,423
Perfect.

2138
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:06,310
Perfect.

2139
01:01:06,310 --> 01:01:07,010
Yeah.

2140
01:01:07,010 --> 01:01:08,310
This fucking fast as fuck.

2141
01:01:08,311 --> 01:01:09,690
And the wheel kick that he knocked out.

2142
01:01:09,691 --> 01:01:10,380
Terry Adam,

2143
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:13,410
do you know that was the first wheel
kit Kao ever in the history of the UFC.

2144
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:14,010
Really?

2145
01:01:14,010 --> 01:01:14,880
That was the first one.

2146
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:17,280
Edson Barboza knocking out.

2147
01:01:17,281 --> 01:01:21,840
Terry Edelman does the first one up
and there's an animated Gif Posa going

2148
01:01:22,140 --> 01:01:24,330
Barboza spinning landing on Edom.

2149
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:25,920
He goes down to in the background,

2150
01:01:25,921 --> 01:01:27,210
Ari should fear it goes like this.

2151
01:01:27,270 --> 01:01:28,830
Oh really?

2152
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:29,071
Yeah.

2153
01:01:29,071 --> 01:01:29,581
Or is like,

2154
01:01:29,581 --> 01:01:32,150
can we see that it's see the credible.

2155
01:01:32,410 --> 01:01:33,300
That's incredible.

2156
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:35,130
Like as the wheel kick lands,

2157
01:01:35,131 --> 01:01:37,440
you see Ari Freak out background.

2158
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:41,430
Did someone make a special video on zoom
in on him and shit and make a meme out

2159
01:01:41,431 --> 01:01:41,670
of it?

2160
01:01:41,670 --> 01:01:42,121
No.

2161
01:01:42,121 --> 01:01:43,380
I'm sure someone asked someone.

2162
01:01:43,430 --> 01:01:44,310
Someone's definitely,

2163
01:01:44,311 --> 01:01:44,971
I've seen it.

2164
01:01:44,971 --> 01:01:46,140
I've definitely seen the meme.

2165
01:01:46,410 --> 01:01:47,243
But um,

2166
01:01:47,250 --> 01:01:48,270
that technique,

2167
01:01:48,271 --> 01:01:50,400
like the way he throws it is perfect.

2168
01:01:50,401 --> 01:01:51,570
Everything he does is perfect.

2169
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:54,870
His switch kick is the best switch
kick I've ever seen in my life.

2170
01:01:54,871 --> 01:01:56,520
I've never seen anybody
throw a better switch.

2171
01:01:56,521 --> 01:01:57,540
Kick Dude.

2172
01:01:57,570 --> 01:01:58,590
Anthony Pettis,

2173
01:01:58,591 --> 01:01:59,031
Charles,

2174
01:01:59,031 --> 01:01:59,864
all of that shit.

2175
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:00,870
Holy God.

2176
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:02,640
Who Watches?

2177
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:04,710
Look in the background.

2178
01:02:04,711 --> 01:02:05,251
See right there.

2179
01:02:05,251 --> 01:02:05,351
He,

2180
01:02:05,351 --> 01:02:06,540
his hands go up to his head.

2181
01:02:06,570 --> 01:02:07,850
Is that what this video is about?

2182
01:02:07,950 --> 01:02:08,371
Look at this.

2183
01:02:08,371 --> 01:02:08,760
Boom.

2184
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:08,971
Yeah,

2185
01:02:08,971 --> 01:02:09,481
exactly.

2186
01:02:09,481 --> 01:02:10,590
Watch he lands in.

2187
01:02:10,710 --> 01:02:13,350
Now look in the background and
you watch Ari's hands come up.

2188
01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:16,020
Is that him right there behind me?

2189
01:02:16,590 --> 01:02:17,610
Watch this one more time.

2190
01:02:19,030 --> 01:02:20,070
Joe Silva right

2191
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:20,260
here.

2192
01:02:20,260 --> 01:02:20,700
Silva.

2193
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:22,380
Now Joe Silva's there an Arby's,

2194
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:23,460
Arby's right behind him.

2195
01:02:23,790 --> 01:02:25,050
You can enlarge that screen.

2196
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:26,550
It was really small.

2197
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:27,713
I might a baker.

2198
01:02:27,740 --> 01:02:28,770
But what do you mean smaller?

2199
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:29,633
What happened?

2200
01:02:32,010 --> 01:02:34,350
UFC history in MMA history.

2201
01:02:34,351 --> 01:02:35,040
Really,

2202
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:36,000
and we're looking at Ra,

2203
01:02:36,001 --> 01:02:38,190
we're focusing like scientifically,

2204
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:40,030
forensically an Ari.

2205
01:02:41,410 --> 01:02:42,243
That's funny.

2206
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:43,020
Um,

2207
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:45,960
but Barboza like as far as like technique,

2208
01:02:45,961 --> 01:02:47,790
like his zero holes in his technique.

2209
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:48,833
Zero.

2210
01:02:48,930 --> 01:02:52,380
He's the one of the best kickers I've
ever seen because he does everything he

2211
01:02:52,381 --> 01:02:54,060
does the traditional kicks.

2212
01:02:54,210 --> 01:02:56,520
He does like a lot of,

2213
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:58,140
a lot of Moyie Thai techniques.

2214
01:02:58,170 --> 01:03:01,650
He's the first guy to ever stopped
to opponents with leg kicks.

2215
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:04,500
Hot Phala Olivera and um,

2216
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:06,300
Mike Lulac Lulo that's right.

2217
01:03:06,690 --> 01:03:07,840
Nasty fucking leg.

2218
01:03:08,060 --> 01:03:08,600
Almost go,

2219
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:09,141
go plot that.

2220
01:03:09,141 --> 01:03:10,520
I mean he was in danger for a little bit.

2221
01:03:10,540 --> 01:03:11,251
That was legit.

2222
01:03:11,251 --> 01:03:12,150
Gogo on him.

2223
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:14,011
Well,

2224
01:03:14,011 --> 01:03:15,090
he went after cowboy,

2225
01:03:15,091 --> 01:03:16,950
remember that fight and then cowboy,

2226
01:03:17,030 --> 01:03:17,280
uh,

2227
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:20,310
caught him with a jab and then
took him down and got his back.

2228
01:03:20,310 --> 01:03:22,380
Barboza Barboza in cowboy.

2229
01:03:22,381 --> 01:03:24,570
You remember that fight
was crazy ass fight.

2230
01:03:24,630 --> 01:03:25,230
Cow Boy.

2231
01:03:25,230 --> 01:03:26,190
Cow Boy.

2232
01:03:26,580 --> 01:03:27,450
He's on fire.

2233
01:03:27,710 --> 01:03:31,390
Do Cowboy Mcgregor
would be fucking insane.

2234
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:31,710
God,

2235
01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:34,730
please make it happen in fucking so,

2236
01:03:34,731 --> 01:03:35,061
I mean,

2237
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:40,061
the biggest fight of all the shit we
might have to stop fighting after that

2238
01:03:40,711 --> 01:03:41,060
fight.

2239
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:44,280
Conor is going to have $700 billion.

2240
01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:45,330
When he retires,

2241
01:03:47,180 --> 01:03:48,550
he's going to be richer than that guy.

2242
01:03:48,590 --> 01:03:49,230
Nobody.

2243
01:03:49,230 --> 01:03:49,880
When he found,

2244
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:52,560
when he buys his first
fucking g five or whatever,

2245
01:03:52,770 --> 01:03:55,240
you don't think he's going to put
that shit on Instagram every day.

2246
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:57,520
What is that going to happen?

2247
01:03:57,790 --> 01:03:59,280
He's going to live in a castle.

2248
01:04:00,090 --> 01:04:01,740
Legitimate check castle.

2249
01:04:01,741 --> 01:04:02,910
A castle with the chair.

2250
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:03,780
He needs that picture.

2251
01:04:03,781 --> 01:04:04,230
That needs,

2252
01:04:04,230 --> 01:04:05,580
that's the ultimate picture.

2253
01:04:05,790 --> 01:04:06,500
He needs to get that.

2254
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:08,790
Look at this child Olvera
closing in on pedes.

2255
01:04:08,791 --> 01:04:11,280
We're watching the Charles all
Avera Anthony Pettis fight.

2256
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:12,840
I've been looking forward to for awhile.

2257
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:14,940
All Avara moved it on pedes.

2258
01:04:14,941 --> 01:04:16,320
He's trying to take him to the ground.

2259
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:17,790
He's wrestled fucking him.

2260
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:19,770
One strike that.

2261
01:04:19,790 --> 01:04:21,150
Do a lot of guys have done,

2262
01:04:21,220 --> 01:04:23,250
he's got all that taekwondo
shall we were talking about.

2263
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:23,800
That's true.

2264
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:24,181
That's true.

2265
01:04:24,181 --> 01:04:26,460
But Holly Vera's pretty
fucking good on his feet too.

2266
01:04:26,670 --> 01:04:27,120
Um,

2267
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:31,260
I'm interested in this because I was
wondering how Oliveira would approach this

2268
01:04:31,261 --> 01:04:31,650
fight.

2269
01:04:31,650 --> 01:04:31,881
His,

2270
01:04:31,881 --> 01:04:32,701
his technique,

2271
01:04:32,701 --> 01:04:34,110
his stand up is very good man.

2272
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:34,770
There's approaches.

2273
01:04:34,770 --> 01:04:35,820
I'm taking this guy down.

2274
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:40,710
That's it seems like fuck that striking
shit is good defense by Pedis though.

2275
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:42,780
Good take down defense so far.

2276
01:04:45,020 --> 01:04:45,660
All it varies.

2277
01:04:45,660 --> 01:04:46,860
A good grappler man.

2278
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:49,980
He submitted guys with a
bunch of different shit too.

2279
01:04:50,190 --> 01:04:51,390
Weird chokes.

2280
01:04:51,750 --> 01:04:52,051
You know,

2281
01:04:52,051 --> 01:04:53,300
like he knows lot of Jim Miller.

2282
01:04:53,301 --> 01:04:55,020
I know Jim Miller.

2283
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:56,730
Jim Miller minibar barred him.

2284
01:04:56,770 --> 01:04:57,900
Yo Shit.

2285
01:04:58,510 --> 01:05:01,190
That's how retarded he got
someone in a calf slicer.

2286
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:04,230
I think it was one of the first
ever calf slicers in the UFC.

2287
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:05,340
I don't know the,

2288
01:05:05,340 --> 01:05:05,800
the uh,

2289
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:06,840
the stats on that.

2290
01:05:07,020 --> 01:05:08,550
I can't remember another one.

2291
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:10,440
Maybe somebody out there can correct me.

2292
01:05:10,650 --> 01:05:11,820
I don't remember another one.

2293
01:05:11,821 --> 01:05:13,980
Wonder people don't believe
me about tower sovereign.

2294
01:05:14,250 --> 01:05:15,240
I can't remember shit.

2295
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:18,310
Damn.

2296
01:05:18,310 --> 01:05:20,680
Olivera sticking to them like glue here.

2297
01:05:23,070 --> 01:05:23,903
Mm.

2298
01:05:24,950 --> 01:05:25,191
Yeah.

2299
01:05:25,191 --> 01:05:27,560
He's one he beat Efrain.

2300
01:05:27,561 --> 01:05:29,330
Escadera would that standing rear naked?

2301
01:05:29,331 --> 01:05:30,164
Remember that fight?

2302
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:31,591
Yeah.

2303
01:05:31,591 --> 01:05:32,700
There's the calf slicer.

2304
01:05:32,970 --> 01:05:33,803
Look at that thing.

2305
01:05:35,970 --> 01:05:36,390
Yeah.

2306
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:39,360
I don't think anybody's ever
tapped anybody with that before.

2307
01:05:39,390 --> 01:05:41,910
Did people call that the
all of the Ark cab crank

2308
01:05:44,010 --> 01:05:45,000
and rightfully so.

2309
01:05:45,420 --> 01:05:46,170
Rightfully so.

2310
01:05:46,170 --> 01:05:47,070
Do it in the UFC.

2311
01:05:47,071 --> 01:05:49,200
If you're the first one that's yours,

2312
01:05:49,330 --> 01:05:50,400
that you own that money.

2313
01:05:50,401 --> 01:05:50,551
Yeah.

2314
01:05:50,551 --> 01:05:51,960
There's a lot of techniques like that.

2315
01:05:51,961 --> 01:05:52,171
All right.

2316
01:05:52,171 --> 01:05:52,441
Look it.

2317
01:05:52,441 --> 01:05:54,860
This Olive Harris got pedis is back.

2318
01:05:55,060 --> 01:05:55,861
Oh,

2319
01:05:55,861 --> 01:05:56,694
Shit.

2320
01:05:57,060 --> 01:05:59,300
Injure danger.

2321
01:06:01,610 --> 01:06:02,443
Oh Shit.

2322
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:05,350
What is going to happen here,

2323
01:06:07,020 --> 01:06:07,501
my friend?

2324
01:06:07,501 --> 01:06:09,390
Not good to have Pettis on top of you.

2325
01:06:09,450 --> 01:06:09,770
Oh,

2326
01:06:09,770 --> 01:06:10,860
he got up in the horse.

2327
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:12,740
Interesting.

2328
01:06:12,740 --> 01:06:13,573
Huh?

2329
01:06:13,710 --> 01:06:14,191
No.

2330
01:06:14,191 --> 01:06:14,731
Slippery,

2331
01:06:14,731 --> 01:06:15,511
slippery,

2332
01:06:15,511 --> 01:06:16,110
slippery.

2333
01:06:16,110 --> 01:06:16,943
Oh,

2334
01:06:16,950 --> 01:06:18,360
here's a little punch for your troubles.

2335
01:06:18,420 --> 01:06:20,730
Great Triangle defense
by pet pedis right there.

2336
01:06:20,820 --> 01:06:21,571
Here's the question.

2337
01:06:21,571 --> 01:06:22,404
How much,

2338
01:06:22,710 --> 01:06:24,330
which all of Airlands around kick first,

2339
01:06:24,510 --> 01:06:27,420
how much of a toll did the
weight cut take on pedes?

2340
01:06:27,421 --> 01:06:27,990
I mean,

2341
01:06:27,990 --> 01:06:31,450
he lost a lot of weight to get down
to one 40 to get that balance in bay.

2342
01:06:31,450 --> 01:06:32,310
Very nice.

2343
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:33,270
You know,

2344
01:06:33,270 --> 01:06:33,600
uh,

2345
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:33,871
you know,

2346
01:06:33,871 --> 01:06:35,640
at first he strikers,

2347
01:06:36,030 --> 01:06:37,800
they were getting taken
down pretty easily,

2348
01:06:37,801 --> 01:06:40,880
but they have oh shit to the bottle.

2349
01:06:41,310 --> 01:06:42,330
Shit to the bunny.

2350
01:06:43,740 --> 01:06:44,700
He's hurting bad.

2351
01:06:45,060 --> 01:06:45,781
Oh,

2352
01:06:45,781 --> 01:06:46,440
look at that.

2353
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:47,251
Look at that balance.

2354
01:06:47,251 --> 01:06:49,650
And Base Pedis is
professional with the digits,

2355
01:06:49,651 --> 01:06:49,861
right?

2356
01:06:49,861 --> 01:06:50,160
They're like,

2357
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:51,870
oh them up.

2358
01:06:51,940 --> 01:06:52,790
Oh you can't.

2359
01:06:52,810 --> 01:06:53,521
Oh God,

2360
01:06:53,521 --> 01:06:54,001
like that.

2361
01:06:54,001 --> 01:06:56,070
You can't have your guard up and
you've got to close that shit.

2362
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:58,320
Oh,

2363
01:06:58,321 --> 01:07:00,890
he's got pulls out.

2364
01:07:01,570 --> 01:07:05,230
Oh that swap walk base.

2365
01:07:05,470 --> 01:07:06,970
Vera's got hard dude.

2366
01:07:08,550 --> 01:07:09,383
Pedis is all.

2367
01:07:09,430 --> 01:07:10,220
Oh,

2368
01:07:10,220 --> 01:07:13,490
oh look at that shit too greasy.

2369
01:07:13,510 --> 01:07:14,270
Look at all that shit.

2370
01:07:14,270 --> 01:07:16,260
The site control that they got pass.

2371
01:07:16,390 --> 01:07:17,310
Very nice.

2372
01:07:17,910 --> 01:07:20,250
Crucifix coming is pedes of black belt.

2373
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:21,470
I don't know man,

2374
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:22,820
cause he's looking like a black belt.

2375
01:07:22,821 --> 01:07:25,020
I want to say he's at
least a brown belt dude.

2376
01:07:25,021 --> 01:07:27,660
He's looking at like a black belt
because all of our is a black belt,

2377
01:07:27,661 --> 01:07:28,260
right?

2378
01:07:28,260 --> 01:07:29,340
Well Damn.

2379
01:07:29,510 --> 01:07:31,440
He's looking great.

2380
01:07:31,590 --> 01:07:32,880
It says submitted some.

2381
01:07:32,940 --> 01:07:34,290
Oh Shit.

2382
01:07:34,740 --> 01:07:35,980
Grapple grapple.

2383
01:07:36,090 --> 01:07:36,923
It's nice to see.

2384
01:07:37,190 --> 01:07:41,610
It's nice to see what high level Jujitsu
guys like Charles Oliver doing in spots

2385
01:07:41,611 --> 01:07:43,560
like this because you're
not hiding technique here.

2386
01:07:43,561 --> 01:07:44,580
You're going to your a game.

2387
01:07:44,581 --> 01:07:45,130
You're a,

2388
01:07:45,130 --> 01:07:47,340
what are you thinking when
you're listening to this?

2389
01:07:47,341 --> 01:07:48,174
I was great.

2390
01:07:48,510 --> 01:07:49,860
That's some great shit and tried.

2391
01:07:49,861 --> 01:07:51,750
He got too aggressive
in going for the croup.

2392
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:52,710
Madec crucifix.

2393
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:54,030
He gave up a z.

2394
01:07:54,031 --> 01:07:54,864
She gave up eyes.

2395
01:07:54,970 --> 01:07:55,830
Ain't no

2396
01:07:58,050 --> 01:07:58,883
shit.

2397
01:07:59,100 --> 01:07:59,431
Dude.

2398
01:07:59,431 --> 01:08:00,780
If he could pull this off.

2399
01:08:00,870 --> 01:08:01,980
Oh Wow.

2400
01:08:03,030 --> 01:08:03,930
What a fight.

2401
01:08:04,990 --> 01:08:08,570
Spect pet has got good defenses
to speak of that these officers,

2402
01:08:08,740 --> 01:08:09,271
any tags,

2403
01:08:09,271 --> 01:08:12,030
all he had his back and
now he's on his back again.

2404
01:08:12,930 --> 01:08:13,910
Oh,

2405
01:08:14,020 --> 01:08:14,640
kick.

2406
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:15,710
Good Keck.

2407
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:16,461
Damn.

2408
01:08:16,461 --> 01:08:18,020
This is a real fight here.

2409
01:08:18,050 --> 01:08:18,883
Look at this shit.

2410
01:08:19,070 --> 01:08:20,510
Oh fuck.

2411
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:21,670
He keeps going after it,

2412
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:22,520
but it's not in there.

2413
01:08:22,580 --> 01:08:26,240
This is to do two are
they only go forward?

2414
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:27,140
I don't know.

2415
01:08:27,190 --> 01:08:28,100
Don't know how to style.

2416
01:08:28,490 --> 01:08:29,920
They just go forward after each other.

2417
01:08:29,921 --> 01:08:30,201
Look at that.

2418
01:08:30,201 --> 01:08:31,034
He's got them in Delhi,

2419
01:08:31,790 --> 01:08:32,061
Delhi,

2420
01:08:32,061 --> 01:08:32,894
Hema for a second.

2421
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:33,733
Oh.

2422
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:35,530
Oh.

2423
01:08:35,530 --> 01:08:36,240
She canceled.

2424
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:37,280
Throw things up man.

2425
01:08:37,281 --> 01:08:39,180
He's constantly throwing
things up at damn tennis.

2426
01:08:39,181 --> 01:08:39,651
Who opened?

2427
01:08:39,651 --> 01:08:40,490
Keeps cracking him.

2428
01:08:40,690 --> 01:08:42,610
Yeah Nigga that Ah yeah.

2429
01:08:42,650 --> 01:08:43,411
Look out for that up.

2430
01:08:43,411 --> 01:08:43,741
Kick me.

2431
01:08:43,741 --> 01:08:44,660
I gotta throw up kicks.

2432
01:08:44,690 --> 01:08:45,710
Oh Shit.

2433
01:08:46,220 --> 01:08:46,910
Oh,

2434
01:08:46,910 --> 01:08:47,511
if your pet is,

2435
01:08:47,511 --> 01:08:48,680
don't you let him stand up here.

2436
01:08:48,740 --> 01:08:49,850
Don't you let them stand up here.

2437
01:08:51,380 --> 01:08:54,950
I think a part of you says that there's
no way he could knock me out here.

2438
01:08:54,951 --> 01:08:58,350
So kind of see of the round and if they,

2439
01:08:58,870 --> 01:08:59,330
if he let,

2440
01:08:59,330 --> 01:09:01,070
a lot of times people you'd Think,

2441
01:09:01,071 --> 01:09:01,221
oh,

2442
01:09:01,221 --> 01:09:02,690
why doesn't he let him up to fuck him up?

2443
01:09:02,690 --> 01:09:04,580
And that's usually the best advice.

2444
01:09:04,581 --> 01:09:05,540
But I,

2445
01:09:05,770 --> 01:09:06,603
uh,

2446
01:09:06,620 --> 01:09:09,590
assume that they're thinking,

2447
01:09:09,620 --> 01:09:09,981
okay,

2448
01:09:09,981 --> 01:09:10,701
if I let him up,

2449
01:09:10,701 --> 01:09:11,534
I'm beating him up.

2450
01:09:11,810 --> 01:09:13,580
He still can throw,

2451
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:14,061
he may be,

2452
01:09:14,061 --> 01:09:16,570
he recovers and he throws a big
fucking shot or knocks me out.

2453
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:17,433
That happens a lot.

2454
01:09:17,540 --> 01:09:21,760
So there's no way he can knock me out on
his back except for that upkick Weiland

2455
01:09:21,790 --> 01:09:22,820
I'm just stay right here.

2456
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:24,313
You know what I mean?

2457
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:25,790
I think that's what they're thinking.

2458
01:09:25,980 --> 01:09:28,370
But it could be also,

2459
01:09:28,371 --> 01:09:30,290
I mean that was a hard fought first round.

2460
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:31,430
You let a guy stand up,

2461
01:09:32,550 --> 01:09:33,383
he's,

2462
01:09:33,540 --> 01:09:35,660
he's got four limbs where
he can knock you out,

2463
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:37,100
you would keep him on his back.

2464
01:09:37,101 --> 01:09:40,210
You just got to watch that up kick
and that shit's so low percentage.

2465
01:09:40,250 --> 01:09:41,870
That's happened three times in history.

2466
01:09:41,910 --> 01:09:42,050
Yeah.

2467
01:09:42,050 --> 01:09:46,610
And he also knows that it's probably
the end of the round has happened a few

2468
01:09:46,611 --> 01:09:47,360
times in the UFC.

2469
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:48,890
What's the greatest upkick ever?

2470
01:09:49,010 --> 01:09:54,010
I say Henzel Gracie versus Ole Tech
Tar off and then there's a Marilla

2471
01:09:54,170 --> 01:09:55,460
Bustamante on Jerry Bolander.

2472
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:55,671
Oh,

2473
01:09:55,671 --> 01:09:56,241
that's right.

2474
01:09:56,241 --> 01:09:56,601
I remember that.

2475
01:09:56,601 --> 01:09:59,030
Which one was first or was that fabulous?

2476
01:09:59,031 --> 01:10:00,200
Your Gel on boat?

2477
01:10:00,201 --> 01:10:00,321
No,

2478
01:10:00,321 --> 01:10:00,441
no,

2479
01:10:00,441 --> 01:10:01,070
it wasn't Fabio.

2480
01:10:01,070 --> 01:10:02,490
It was Morella booster McGuinness.

2481
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:06,590
Boom Pedis with the body
kick Oliver in deep shit.

2482
01:10:06,860 --> 01:10:11,860
Can you find Marillo Bustamante
Jerry Boland who go up kick around.

2483
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:13,100
That would be awesome.

2484
01:10:13,130 --> 01:10:13,491
Jamie.

2485
01:10:13,491 --> 01:10:14,301
I don't mean to be like,

2486
01:10:14,301 --> 01:10:14,810
uh,

2487
01:10:14,810 --> 01:10:16,460
I like I own the show
or anything like that,

2488
01:10:16,461 --> 01:10:17,870
so if I stepped over my bounds,

2489
01:10:17,871 --> 01:10:19,970
no worries to Joe
because he's got my back.

2490
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:20,300
Ooh.

2491
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:20,600
On the,

2492
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:22,220
unlike all the various technique,

2493
01:10:22,221 --> 01:10:22,680
man.

2494
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:25,250
So he looks so smooth like
that front kick to the body,

2495
01:10:25,251 --> 01:10:26,084
man.

2496
01:10:26,470 --> 01:10:28,640
Olvera it looks very smooth on the feet,

2497
01:10:28,641 --> 01:10:29,030
man.

2498
01:10:29,030 --> 01:10:29,990
Very smooth.

2499
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:30,890
Good rhythm.

2500
01:10:30,890 --> 01:10:32,450
Yeti was trying to take
him down right away.

2501
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:32,600
Yeah.

2502
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:34,610
Well I think he wants to just show them.

2503
01:10:34,610 --> 01:10:35,720
You can beat him both ways.

2504
01:10:36,230 --> 01:10:37,280
It's taking them down again,

2505
01:10:37,281 --> 01:10:38,114
look at this,

2506
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:39,080
spins around,

2507
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:40,160
gets the back.

2508
01:10:40,420 --> 01:10:41,930
God Damn Petty.

2509
01:10:42,740 --> 01:10:44,110
No joke on course.

2510
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:45,673
Look at that.

2511
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:46,940
And he's going to let him out.

2512
01:10:46,941 --> 01:10:47,850
Now he's going to let him,

2513
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:48,860
I was going to let him stand out.

2514
01:10:48,861 --> 01:10:51,740
He told me his timeline
coaching in the corner.

2515
01:10:51,741 --> 01:10:52,640
They were probably saying,

2516
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:53,150
you,

2517
01:10:53,150 --> 01:10:54,890
you going to fuck this
guy up at that left kick?

2518
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:56,870
Look at Bolunda right there.

2519
01:10:57,020 --> 01:10:57,501
Oh,

2520
01:10:57,501 --> 01:10:58,220
head kick.

2521
01:10:58,220 --> 01:10:58,641
Look at Dad.

2522
01:10:58,641 --> 01:10:59,380
He went over the top.

2523
01:10:59,380 --> 01:10:59,880
Oh,

2524
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:00,290
look at that.

2525
01:11:00,290 --> 01:11:01,123
That's it

2526
01:11:03,490 --> 01:11:03,800
too.

2527
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:04,600
Oh,

2528
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:05,930
Olivera with a right hand.

2529
01:11:06,290 --> 01:11:08,900
All the Avera has got a bad
swelling on the left eye.

2530
01:11:08,990 --> 01:11:09,171
Oh,

2531
01:11:09,171 --> 01:11:10,430
and he just got tagged there too,

2532
01:11:10,580 --> 01:11:11,413
probably from some of that.

2533
01:11:11,510 --> 01:11:11,811
Oh,

2534
01:11:11,811 --> 01:11:14,130
look at that beautiful
jab pedis is targeting it.

2535
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:16,240
Okay.

2536
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:16,510
Oh,

2537
01:11:16,510 --> 01:11:17,380
he's going to let him up.

2538
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:18,970
I think all of our struggling,

2539
01:11:18,971 --> 01:11:19,360
man,

2540
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:21,100
he can't see very good
out of that iron man.

2541
01:11:21,101 --> 01:11:23,620
He's really badly swollen up and when it,

2542
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:25,480
when it starts swelling up that quick,

2543
01:11:25,481 --> 01:11:27,520
you gotta wonder like
how bad that injury is,

2544
01:11:27,521 --> 01:11:28,181
how bad it is.

2545
01:11:28,181 --> 01:11:29,230
Man keeps coming forward.

2546
01:11:29,231 --> 01:11:29,660
Looking down.

2547
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:30,493
What does an animal,

2548
01:11:31,180 --> 01:11:32,500
he's throwing heavy shit too.

2549
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:32,820
Oh,

2550
01:11:32,820 --> 01:11:33,431
he's that fucker.

2551
01:11:33,431 --> 01:11:35,700
He just going forward
like a Goddamn Cyborg.

2552
01:11:35,730 --> 01:11:36,070
Yeah.

2553
01:11:36,070 --> 01:11:37,030
Look at that one too.

2554
01:11:39,430 --> 01:11:43,170
I liked the way all of Eric Leeds
with that front kick to that Chow.

2555
01:11:43,240 --> 01:11:45,310
He throws a lot of that
left leg front kick.

2556
01:11:45,311 --> 01:11:46,144
It's nice.

2557
01:11:47,470 --> 01:11:48,310
Very Crisp.

2558
01:11:48,790 --> 01:11:49,450
He like really?

2559
01:11:49,450 --> 01:11:50,480
He fucks with you with

2560
01:11:52,090 --> 01:11:52,870
Polish.

2561
01:11:52,870 --> 01:11:54,370
Oh Shit.

2562
01:11:56,020 --> 01:11:56,291
Right.

2563
01:11:56,291 --> 01:11:57,860
Hug all of that pressure.

2564
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:01,091
God Damn.

2565
01:12:01,091 --> 01:12:01,900
What a fight.

2566
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:02,770
He's won a fight.

2567
01:12:03,070 --> 01:12:03,903
Beasts.

2568
01:12:04,050 --> 01:12:04,660
Oh.

2569
01:12:04,660 --> 01:12:04,840
Oh,

2570
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:05,750
right hand by pennys.

2571
01:12:05,751 --> 01:12:06,730
Right hand by Oliveira.

2572
01:12:08,270 --> 01:12:08,590
Okay.

2573
01:12:08,590 --> 01:12:08,921
Pedis.

2574
01:12:08,921 --> 01:12:10,660
Got some sweet boxing man.

2575
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:12,640
He's like countering beautifully.

2576
01:12:12,820 --> 01:12:13,960
He's taken a lot of shit,

2577
01:12:14,230 --> 01:12:17,080
but you know he's landing a lot of rights.

2578
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:18,700
This is amazing.

2579
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:20,021
Oh,

2580
01:12:20,021 --> 01:12:20,830
is that an elbowed?

2581
01:12:20,830 --> 01:12:21,663
Yeah,

2582
01:12:22,950 --> 01:12:23,783
you don't,

2583
01:12:24,010 --> 01:12:26,820
it seems like people
are thriving right hand.

2584
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:27,810
Oh,

2585
01:12:27,810 --> 01:12:28,860
but it throws elbows.

2586
01:12:29,410 --> 01:12:31,530
Alverez very clean with his Muay Thai man.

2587
01:12:31,531 --> 01:12:34,950
He does a lot of real
good tactics right hand.

2588
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:35,341
No,

2589
01:12:35,341 --> 01:12:36,174
he's not.

2590
01:12:36,390 --> 01:12:36,961
Oh,

2591
01:12:36,961 --> 01:12:37,860
right in over the top.

2592
01:12:38,130 --> 01:12:38,963
I don't think.

2593
01:12:41,730 --> 01:12:42,563
Yeah,

2594
01:12:42,580 --> 01:12:43,413
I forget where.

2595
01:12:43,490 --> 01:12:45,760
Find out were Charles Olivera trains.

2596
01:12:47,250 --> 01:12:47,730
Okay.

2597
01:12:47,730 --> 01:12:49,620
I don't think it's a
Novo and y'all though.

2598
01:12:51,020 --> 01:12:52,650
I'm almost positive it's not.

2599
01:12:54,090 --> 01:12:54,860
Oh look at this.

2600
01:12:54,860 --> 01:12:54,990
He's,

2601
01:12:54,990 --> 01:12:56,170
Oh shit.

2602
01:12:56,670 --> 01:12:57,320
Oh Shit.

2603
01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:58,230
Oh Shit.

2604
01:12:59,100 --> 01:12:59,610
This is,

2605
01:12:59,610 --> 01:13:02,460
this is why you need to be razor
sharp on the back right here.

2606
01:13:02,461 --> 01:13:04,200
This is your opportunity to win.

2607
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:07,980
You have an opportunity to just going to
just let it slip through your fingers.

2608
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:09,510
Look at this man,

2609
01:13:09,540 --> 01:13:10,201
look at this.

2610
01:13:10,201 --> 01:13:11,100
No Pun intended.

2611
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:12,300
Hennessy's back.

2612
01:13:12,660 --> 01:13:14,350
And he can just controlling
them to see that bike.

2613
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,260
Rarely good here.

2614
01:13:16,270 --> 01:13:18,150
You gotta be really good on the back.

2615
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:19,320
You got the back.

2616
01:13:20,070 --> 01:13:21,240
You should take advantage of it.

2617
01:13:21,241 --> 01:13:22,080
What else do you need?

2618
01:13:22,110 --> 01:13:23,040
You've got the back,

2619
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:23,941
both leg hooks.

2620
01:13:23,941 --> 01:13:24,980
You've gotta add fucking low.

2621
01:13:24,981 --> 01:13:26,190
Look at body triangle.

2622
01:13:26,191 --> 01:13:27,090
What else do you mean?

2623
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:28,250
Is there something in capable?

2624
01:13:28,290 --> 01:13:29,220
What should he be doing here?

2625
01:13:29,221 --> 01:13:29,790
Man,

2626
01:13:29,790 --> 01:13:30,301
he should,

2627
01:13:30,301 --> 01:13:30,660
uh,

2628
01:13:30,660 --> 01:13:31,493
elder people.

2629
01:13:31,830 --> 01:13:32,340
I mean,

2630
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:32,731
there's a,

2631
01:13:32,731 --> 01:13:34,220
there's a risk.

2632
01:13:34,710 --> 01:13:39,210
There's a hand fight and it's just the
catered and complicated and you got to

2633
01:13:39,211 --> 01:13:39,550
win.

2634
01:13:39,550 --> 01:13:40,890
There's a battle going on.

2635
01:13:41,220 --> 01:13:44,040
Anthony Pettis is used in both
his hands to defend his neck.

2636
01:13:44,490 --> 01:13:45,323
And uh,

2637
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:47,700
and he's got good angle
at that defense too.

2638
01:13:47,701 --> 01:13:52,320
So it's really difficult because even
though Anthony Pettis has his back taken

2639
01:13:52,740 --> 01:13:54,420
the way he would defend that choke,

2640
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:54,890
he,

2641
01:13:54,890 --> 01:13:56,310
it's like doing a pull up like this.

2642
01:13:56,311 --> 01:13:57,330
Very strong.

2643
01:13:57,331 --> 01:13:57,990
It's very,

2644
01:13:57,990 --> 01:13:59,590
it becomes very sophisticated.

2645
01:14:00,230 --> 01:14:00,750
Ooh,

2646
01:14:00,750 --> 01:14:01,650
he's broken through.

2647
01:14:01,651 --> 01:14:02,520
He's on top now.

2648
01:14:02,540 --> 01:14:03,450
A lot of grease,

2649
01:14:04,130 --> 01:14:04,681
a lot of grease.

2650
01:14:04,681 --> 01:14:05,461
You got to keep that,

2651
01:14:05,461 --> 01:14:06,000
uh,

2652
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:10,410
that the body lock triangle on as as
much as you can when there's too much

2653
01:14:10,411 --> 01:14:11,244
grease.

2654
01:14:13,390 --> 01:14:14,800
And by Greece I mean sweat.

2655
01:14:15,340 --> 01:14:16,173
I don't,

2656
01:14:16,390 --> 01:14:18,850
I don't mean Brevile
accuses people of greasing.

2657
01:14:18,860 --> 01:14:19,281
No,

2658
01:14:19,281 --> 01:14:19,541
no,

2659
01:14:19,541 --> 01:14:19,781
no,

2660
01:14:19,781 --> 01:14:19,931
no.

2661
01:14:19,931 --> 01:14:22,720
I meant sweat are damn good technique.

2662
01:14:23,260 --> 01:14:23,591
Oh,

2663
01:14:23,591 --> 01:14:27,180
nice knee to the body on the
brake and a right hand by Avera.

2664
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:28,240
Holy Shit.

2665
01:14:30,140 --> 01:14:30,973
Yeah.

2666
01:14:31,860 --> 01:14:34,030
Austin in Houston.

2667
01:14:34,160 --> 01:14:35,770
Tranes in Houston and
I can't find the gym,

2668
01:14:35,771 --> 01:14:37,630
but just keep saying Houston everywhere.

2669
01:14:37,810 --> 01:14:37,991
Oh,

2670
01:14:37,991 --> 01:14:38,500
well he's,

2671
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:41,410
I know he started out at some place in
Brazil because they were showing it on

2672
01:14:41,411 --> 01:14:42,244
television.

2673
01:14:44,450 --> 01:14:45,080
Yeah,

2674
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:45,771
pretty sure.

2675
01:14:45,771 --> 01:14:46,604
Right?

2676
01:14:46,790 --> 01:14:48,750
Didn't they have like a whole pile of,

2677
01:14:48,770 --> 01:14:49,431
but yeah,

2678
01:14:49,431 --> 01:14:51,440
I think they went to his original gym.

2679
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:51,741
Oh,

2680
01:14:51,741 --> 01:14:52,940
pedes or the kings of the body.

2681
01:14:55,450 --> 01:14:58,010
Pedis is another one
who was pretty flawless.

2682
01:14:58,430 --> 01:15:01,430
Traditional taekwondo style techniques.

2683
01:15:01,431 --> 01:15:02,264
Right hand.

2684
01:15:02,390 --> 01:15:03,223
Oh Shit.

2685
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:04,973
Oh,

2686
01:15:05,630 --> 01:15:06,560
Oliver gets it.

2687
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:09,050
Pedis taking some big deep breaths.

2688
01:15:10,550 --> 01:15:13,240
It's what is called a video training.

2689
01:15:14,350 --> 01:15:15,410
That's his jam.

2690
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:16,580
Gold.

2691
01:15:16,580 --> 01:15:17,091
I don't know.

2692
01:15:17,091 --> 01:15:18,460
I think I,

2693
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:19,730
that's not the video that I saw.

2694
01:15:19,731 --> 01:15:20,241
There was a,

2695
01:15:20,241 --> 01:15:21,650
in preparation for this fight,

2696
01:15:21,651 --> 01:15:22,970
so I'm not quite sure,

2697
01:15:22,971 --> 01:15:24,740
but whatever it is,

2698
01:15:24,741 --> 01:15:26,420
he's super well trained.

2699
01:15:26,421 --> 01:15:27,254
We should find out what,

2700
01:15:27,570 --> 01:15:29,000
what does a camp is?

2701
01:15:29,060 --> 01:15:30,500
Just give him a shout out.

2702
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:32,180
If that was three girls rain,

2703
01:15:32,210 --> 01:15:34,970
if there was three rules are two
or whatever you can think of.

2704
01:15:35,590 --> 01:15:37,400
You can make the change right now.

2705
01:15:37,430 --> 01:15:38,510
Not The scoring system.

2706
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:40,070
Just rules in the game.

2707
01:15:40,250 --> 01:15:43,430
What would they be if you had
all the power of this head,

2708
01:15:43,550 --> 01:15:47,090
the commissioner of the Nevada State
Athletic Commission came to you and said,

2709
01:15:47,091 --> 01:15:47,690
Joe,

2710
01:15:47,690 --> 01:15:48,501
whatever you want,

2711
01:15:48,501 --> 01:15:49,490
let's fix this sport.

2712
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:52,070
What are the three major
things you think we trust you?

2713
01:15:52,071 --> 01:15:53,120
You're so knowledgeable.

2714
01:15:53,121 --> 01:15:53,811
You fucking her.

2715
01:15:53,811 --> 01:15:54,740
Amazing man.

2716
01:15:54,770 --> 01:15:54,981
Well,

2717
01:15:54,981 --> 01:15:56,380
I'm tired of getting blown here.

2718
01:15:57,830 --> 01:15:58,581
Said no guy,

2719
01:15:58,581 --> 01:15:59,060
ever,

2720
01:15:59,060 --> 01:15:59,893
no guy over.

2721
01:16:00,290 --> 01:16:01,123
Um,

2722
01:16:01,370 --> 01:16:02,300
what would I tell them to do?

2723
01:16:02,301 --> 01:16:02,691
First of all,

2724
01:16:02,691 --> 01:16:04,040
I don't think it needs to be fixed.

2725
01:16:04,250 --> 01:16:05,210
I think we could all,

2726
01:16:05,211 --> 01:16:05,600
um,

2727
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:06,920
I think the best way.

2728
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:08,100
Yeah,

2729
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:13,100
the best way to find out what the best
rule changes would be is to talk to all

2730
01:16:15,051 --> 01:16:15,890
the experts,

2731
01:16:16,250 --> 01:16:18,860
talk to all the most respected trainers,

2732
01:16:19,130 --> 01:16:24,130
the Duke Roufus is in the for Rasa hobbies
in the Matt Humes and all those guys.

2733
01:16:24,441 --> 01:16:29,441
Talk to them and then talk to a former
fighters that are really smart guys like

2734
01:16:30,831 --> 01:16:35,690
Brian Stan talk to guys like Dominick
Cruz talked to guys who are added right

2735
01:16:35,691 --> 01:16:35,931
now,

2736
01:16:35,931 --> 01:16:40,190
like John Jones who were in their prime
talk to everybody could talk to George

2737
01:16:40,190 --> 01:16:43,970
Saint Pierre and then get sort of an
understanding of what everybody would like

2738
01:16:43,971 --> 01:16:47,960
to see change to what they think would
be changed if they had their way.

2739
01:16:49,130 --> 01:16:50,780
I think that's probably
the best way to do it,

2740
01:16:50,810 --> 01:16:54,090
to do it as a a community
because I think a,

2741
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:56,660
there's not going to be a
total agreement on things,

2742
01:16:56,930 --> 01:17:01,930
but I think we can come to like some
reasonable reasonable agreements if we all

2743
01:17:01,971 --> 01:17:06,971
just sat down and explored what would
be the best options for rules for safety

2744
01:17:07,690 --> 01:17:08,330
lead.

2745
01:17:08,330 --> 01:17:09,163
Throw it up at our,

2746
01:17:12,410 --> 01:17:13,243
that was slick.

2747
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:13,681
Yeah,

2748
01:17:13,681 --> 01:17:14,700
he just snapped on it.

2749
01:17:14,730 --> 01:17:15,370
Mm.

2750
01:17:15,370 --> 01:17:16,560
Let's see if he could pull it off.

2751
01:17:16,570 --> 01:17:20,820
But I'm talking about in a
fast and in a fantasy world,

2752
01:17:20,850 --> 01:17:21,750
in a fantasy world,

2753
01:17:21,780 --> 01:17:22,570
I know you're talking about,

2754
01:17:22,570 --> 01:17:24,030
it's like the movement
in the fantasy world.

2755
01:17:24,031 --> 01:17:24,864
That's what I would do.

2756
01:17:25,770 --> 01:17:26,490
Uh,

2757
01:17:26,490 --> 01:17:26,731
I would,

2758
01:17:26,731 --> 01:17:26,850
uh,

2759
01:17:26,850 --> 01:17:27,541
I would definitely,

2760
01:17:27,541 --> 01:17:28,560
if it was up to me,

2761
01:17:28,590 --> 01:17:29,281
that's what I would do.

2762
01:17:29,281 --> 01:17:30,150
I would put it up to,

2763
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:31,680
and what would you be included?

2764
01:17:31,681 --> 01:17:33,840
Would you be included
in that group of people?

2765
01:17:34,100 --> 01:17:34,261
Okay,

2766
01:17:34,261 --> 01:17:34,980
so,

2767
01:17:34,980 --> 01:17:35,760
so you,

2768
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:39,480
everyone would have to vote on their top
three and you put it all together and

2769
01:17:39,481 --> 01:17:40,410
then from there you decide,

2770
01:17:40,470 --> 01:17:41,040
yeah,

2771
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:42,300
pat is on top again.

2772
01:17:42,660 --> 01:17:43,710
Tim is a great fight.

2773
01:17:43,910 --> 01:17:44,220
Um,

2774
01:17:44,220 --> 01:17:45,390
I would think number one,

2775
01:17:45,450 --> 01:17:47,130
much more comprehensive rule system.

2776
01:17:47,430 --> 01:17:48,300
Let's find out,

2777
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:48,750
um,

2778
01:17:48,750 --> 01:17:49,291
what's fine out.

2779
01:17:49,291 --> 01:17:50,640
What rules make sense,

2780
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,850
what rules are like the 12
to six elbow that's gone,

2781
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:54,390
that,

2782
01:17:54,390 --> 01:17:56,730
that makes it illegal.

2783
01:17:56,760 --> 01:17:59,280
It's really from the mountain
only word that comes into play,

2784
01:17:59,281 --> 01:17:59,381
right?

2785
01:17:59,381 --> 01:18:00,390
It's totally,

2786
01:18:00,391 --> 01:18:01,530
it's a legit technique.

2787
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:05,400
And then I think you and I had a point
and I think it should be discussed.

2788
01:18:05,550 --> 01:18:08,670
Why can't you elbow someone in the back
of the head when you can kick him in the

2789
01:18:08,671 --> 01:18:12,310
back of the head when you can you
in transitions guys get kicked.

2790
01:18:12,311 --> 01:18:12,780
We this.

2791
01:18:12,780 --> 01:18:14,070
Oh Shit.

2792
01:18:14,670 --> 01:18:16,380
Oh Shit.

2793
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:18,630
Oh,

2794
01:18:18,631 --> 01:18:19,710
and he's not a black belt.

2795
01:18:19,711 --> 01:18:20,740
He's getting it tomorrow morning.

2796
01:18:20,750 --> 01:18:21,870
Oh my goodness.

2797
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:25,320
He caught him with a fucking
good teen and tapped him shit.

2798
01:18:25,321 --> 01:18:27,490
Guillotine Woo entity.

2799
01:18:28,490 --> 01:18:30,480
It's got some finishing
power on the ground,

2800
01:18:30,481 --> 01:18:31,260
man.

2801
01:18:31,260 --> 01:18:32,093
Wow,

2802
01:18:32,310 --> 01:18:33,240
that's fantastic.

2803
01:18:33,241 --> 01:18:35,850
Look at that beautiful display right
there to went over and hugged him.

2804
01:18:35,900 --> 01:18:37,350
Olivera kissed him on the cheek.

2805
01:18:37,950 --> 01:18:38,910
That's beautiful.

2806
01:18:39,540 --> 01:18:41,850
I don't know why that's
touching to me for real.

2807
01:18:41,851 --> 01:18:42,630
Like,

2808
01:18:42,630 --> 01:18:42,780
uh,

2809
01:18:42,780 --> 01:18:44,850
it sounds like a bullshit thing to say.

2810
01:18:44,910 --> 01:18:45,271
You know,

2811
01:18:45,271 --> 01:18:45,510
like,

2812
01:18:45,510 --> 01:18:45,870
ah,

2813
01:18:45,870 --> 01:18:46,441
look at that.

2814
01:18:46,441 --> 01:18:47,131
They made friends.

2815
01:18:47,131 --> 01:18:47,964
How cute.

2816
01:18:48,030 --> 01:18:49,770
But like really it,

2817
01:18:49,771 --> 01:18:50,604
um,

2818
01:18:50,730 --> 01:18:51,960
that means a lot man.

2819
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:55,560
When you see these two guys trained
for each other for months at a time,

2820
01:18:55,680 --> 01:18:57,870
talk shit about how the
fights going to go down.

2821
01:18:58,380 --> 01:18:59,213
Talk about,

2822
01:18:59,250 --> 01:19:00,000
you know,

2823
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,350
beating each other's asses

2824
01:19:02,230 --> 01:19:04,660
and damn all that beautiful hold heat.

2825
01:19:04,670 --> 01:19:05,570
A full transition.

2826
01:19:05,571 --> 01:19:06,230
Look at this.

2827
01:19:06,230 --> 01:19:07,490
He's going for the single,

2828
01:19:07,790 --> 01:19:08,511
he misses it.

2829
01:19:08,511 --> 01:19:12,080
And the transition to the double catches
a guillotine and gets that perfect over

2830
01:19:12,081 --> 01:19:12,800
the top.

2831
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:14,210
That is nasty as fuck.

2832
01:19:14,240 --> 01:19:16,100
That is locked down.

2833
01:19:16,220 --> 01:19:19,040
He got 'em in the chat that with
that grip right under the chin,

2834
01:19:19,041 --> 01:19:22,400
right that pill and he can't
get it out and you know what?

2835
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:24,180
Oh yeah,

2836
01:19:24,181 --> 01:19:26,000
I could follow the ride in the morning.

2837
01:19:27,590 --> 01:19:27,861
Yeah.

2838
01:19:27,861 --> 01:19:28,940
And he's pushing against it.

2839
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:30,920
The fence is weird man.

2840
01:19:30,950 --> 01:19:34,400
I think it helps things and I think it
makes it way easy to take people down.

2841
01:19:34,650 --> 01:19:36,020
Like there's a lot of wrestlers,

2842
01:19:36,170 --> 01:19:36,800
like if it,

2843
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:38,180
if the fence didn't exist,

2844
01:19:38,181 --> 01:19:39,680
good fucking luck.

2845
01:19:40,010 --> 01:19:41,510
Good luck trying to take them down.

2846
01:19:41,540 --> 01:19:42,140
But it's,

2847
01:19:42,140 --> 01:19:46,280
the fence also makes it harder to take
people down and in another sense where

2848
01:19:46,281 --> 01:19:47,390
you're leaning against the fence,

2849
01:19:47,570 --> 01:19:48,403
you could put all,

2850
01:19:48,680 --> 01:19:53,240
it's an art totally to use all your
weight into the fence and just to use a

2851
01:19:53,241 --> 01:19:54,074
fence as a,

2852
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:57,780
as in your favor when you're
working on your take down the fence,

2853
01:19:58,270 --> 01:20:00,050
there truly is a difference between MMA,

2854
01:20:00,051 --> 01:20:01,220
wrestling and wrestling.

2855
01:20:01,370 --> 01:20:05,660
There should be a tournament would call
fence wrestling where you start and you

2856
01:20:05,661 --> 01:20:08,030
have a guy against the
fence and as soon as he gets

2857
01:20:08,030 --> 01:20:10,200
circle out now you switch
and you go back and forth.

2858
01:20:10,290 --> 01:20:12,210
See who gets the most
takedowns off the fence.

2859
01:20:12,270 --> 01:20:13,260
That would be a great skill.

2860
01:20:13,261 --> 01:20:16,440
Like you know how you say
taekwondo is a good skill to have.

2861
01:20:16,441 --> 01:20:19,140
If you're like a Wonderboy and you
can throw those perfect kind of kicks.

2862
01:20:19,470 --> 01:20:20,550
If you had a sport,

2863
01:20:20,551 --> 01:20:22,250
a separate sport fence wrestling,

2864
01:20:22,260 --> 01:20:23,370
that was just fence wrestling.

2865
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:24,900
That is actually a really good idea.

2866
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:26,180
That'd be for MMA.

2867
01:20:26,230 --> 01:20:29,820
It would prepare you better for
him and that's a big difference.

2868
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,050
Do you think with fencing,

2869
01:20:31,090 --> 01:20:32,490
without fence difference?

2870
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:33,121
Fuck yeah.

2871
01:20:33,121 --> 01:20:34,140
He couldn't run away either.

2872
01:20:34,310 --> 01:20:38,070
So you think parents will let their kids
wrestle in a cage if they had school

2873
01:20:38,071 --> 01:20:39,600
meets the parents?

2874
01:20:39,601 --> 01:20:39,931
I know.

2875
01:20:39,931 --> 01:20:40,764
Hell yeah.

2876
01:20:42,300 --> 01:20:46,650
I got parents that they want their kids
to fight in the UFC more than the kids

2877
01:20:46,651 --> 01:20:49,230
do their down his book,

2878
01:20:50,660 --> 01:20:54,780
Cajun Rubber Guard show
it to all that shit.

2879
01:20:54,980 --> 01:20:56,430
We was doing ballet.

2880
01:20:56,700 --> 01:20:59,050
He's doing swimming.

2881
01:20:59,970 --> 01:21:01,080
That's hilarious.

2882
01:21:01,290 --> 01:21:03,090
He's doing water polo for that explosion.

2883
01:21:03,091 --> 01:21:06,470
You imagine if like all wrestling meets
turned into the cage wrestling meets.

2884
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:08,490
I know Russell and attendance is down.

2885
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:10,620
I've got good news and I've got bad news.

2886
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:15,390
Good news is we got a solution to bad
news is involves your little angels

2887
01:21:15,391 --> 01:21:16,490
wrestling in a cage.

2888
01:21:16,530 --> 01:21:21,150
How about you have instead of
instead of a six mats out there,

2889
01:21:21,270 --> 01:21:22,170
like in a high school,

2890
01:21:22,171 --> 01:21:26,490
you have six cages out there
and it's just cage wrestling.

2891
01:21:26,610 --> 01:21:28,020
You'd have to get six fucking cages.

2892
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:28,171
Yeah,

2893
01:21:28,171 --> 01:21:31,620
but you can't have cages
run simultaneously as you
can just like a regular

2894
01:21:31,621 --> 01:21:33,030
wrestling tournament or
just get a tournament.

2895
01:21:33,070 --> 01:21:36,420
There's it at the world as 12
matches going on at the same time.

2896
01:21:36,510 --> 01:21:37,960
You just put a little cages in each map.

2897
01:21:38,050 --> 01:21:38,290
No,

2898
01:21:38,290 --> 01:21:39,850
but doesn't it seem like,

2899
01:21:40,350 --> 01:21:40,561
dude,

2900
01:21:40,561 --> 01:21:41,670
this is a fantasy world.

2901
01:21:42,630 --> 01:21:43,530
Jesus Christ,

2902
01:21:44,250 --> 01:21:45,900
I'm not trying to fund this like,

2903
01:21:45,901 --> 01:21:46,734
dude,

2904
01:21:46,950 --> 01:21:49,290
he was $30,000 to get the cages,

2905
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:50,340
clothings optional.

2906
01:21:50,370 --> 01:21:51,480
Who's going to bring the cages?

2907
01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:52,960
We got a cage.

2908
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:53,793
Oils,

2909
01:21:53,980 --> 01:21:54,390
oils,

2910
01:21:54,390 --> 01:21:54,870
optional.

2911
01:21:54,870 --> 01:21:57,090
You guys are going to oil it or
are you guys going to go dry today?

2912
01:21:57,990 --> 01:21:59,220
Turkish oil wrestling,

2913
01:21:59,221 --> 01:22:00,150
you know they have that shit,

2914
01:22:00,180 --> 01:22:01,290
the oil each other up.

2915
01:22:01,291 --> 01:22:02,640
You ever seen that dude?

2916
01:22:02,641 --> 01:22:04,950
They reach into each other's
pants or grabbed their boulevard.

2917
01:22:04,980 --> 01:22:09,980
Greatest photoshops ever of all time
back when Photoshop was first invented,

2918
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,600
they took one of them
Turkish oil wrestling.

2919
01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:15,180
Was it like they look like
they're in leather pants,

2920
01:22:15,210 --> 01:22:17,010
topless leather pants.

2921
01:22:17,011 --> 01:22:18,660
It looks like a Chippendale's outfit,

2922
01:22:18,661 --> 01:22:23,070
but it's actually serious sports
going on without wrestling and they're

2923
01:22:23,071 --> 01:22:28,071
completely covered in oil and you can
reach part of the sport is reaching inside

2924
01:22:29,070 --> 01:22:31,920
the man's pants to grip around his balls.

2925
01:22:32,250 --> 01:22:33,930
That is part of the game.

2926
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:35,780
That is part of the game.

2927
01:22:35,940 --> 01:22:36,710
I want to note,

2928
01:22:36,710 --> 01:22:37,440
there it is.

2929
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:38,273
I want to know,

2930
01:22:38,450 --> 01:22:39,283
uh,

2931
01:22:39,900 --> 01:22:41,220
where the schools for this.

2932
01:22:41,250 --> 01:22:41,760
I'm like,

2933
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:42,121
what does that,

2934
01:22:42,121 --> 01:22:43,290
what do the schools look like?

2935
01:22:43,710 --> 01:22:45,480
How do you train for this dude?

2936
01:22:45,490 --> 01:22:46,770
They oil each other up.

2937
01:22:46,771 --> 01:22:50,300
They were really tight leather pants
like during Judas priest and you're going

2938
01:22:50,301 --> 01:22:54,200
to get each other's dicks and ball
bags and they wrestle really brown.

2939
01:22:54,230 --> 01:22:57,210
The balls are like handles.

2940
01:22:57,420 --> 01:22:58,980
It's totally legal to grab balls.

2941
01:22:58,981 --> 01:23:00,120
Think there's any rules at all.

2942
01:23:00,121 --> 01:23:01,710
I just think you can't look at this.

2943
01:23:02,610 --> 01:23:03,211
He's got his hand,

2944
01:23:03,211 --> 01:23:04,110
his fucking pants,

2945
01:23:04,111 --> 01:23:04,650
bro.

2946
01:23:04,650 --> 01:23:07,000
Can You the coaching grab his Dick.

2947
01:23:07,210 --> 01:23:08,620
That is so insane.

2948
01:23:08,840 --> 01:23:09,673
Says Whoa.

2949
01:23:09,700 --> 01:23:10,780
You guys are all standing around.

2950
01:23:13,540 --> 01:23:15,880
You know there's at least one
guy with watching that going,

2951
01:23:15,881 --> 01:23:16,691
please don't get hard.

2952
01:23:16,691 --> 01:23:17,441
Please don't get hard.

2953
01:23:17,441 --> 01:23:18,230
Please don't get hard.

2954
01:23:18,230 --> 01:23:18,750
Not yet.

2955
01:23:18,750 --> 01:23:19,030
Yeah,

2956
01:23:19,030 --> 01:23:19,870
if you get hard,

2957
01:23:19,910 --> 01:23:21,340
it's bad for the game.

2958
01:23:21,700 --> 01:23:23,130
You can play hard and it's like,

2959
01:23:23,140 --> 01:23:23,321
yeah,

2960
01:23:23,321 --> 01:23:23,691
it was cool.

2961
01:23:23,691 --> 01:23:27,220
I was all over most up six points and
then I got a hard on and I was trying to

2962
01:23:27,221 --> 01:23:29,200
think of Margaret Thatcher
naked on a cold day.

2963
01:23:29,230 --> 01:23:29,830
It didn't work.

2964
01:23:29,830 --> 01:23:31,230
And you know what?

2965
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:32,500
I'm not going to make any excuses.

2966
01:23:32,501 --> 01:23:33,334
My Dick got hardware,

2967
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:33,821
whatever.

2968
01:23:33,821 --> 01:23:34,930
I should have jerked off.

2969
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:35,981
I fucked up.

2970
01:23:35,981 --> 01:23:36,880
I knew I fucked up

2971
01:23:40,630 --> 01:23:42,160
Olympic swimming water polo.

2972
01:23:42,161 --> 01:23:42,994
Ken,

2973
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:49,080
how come they can play beach volleyball
but chickson literally in thongs and

2974
01:23:49,161 --> 01:23:50,260
super slow mo like,

2975
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:54,610
like the championship has decided that
he was winning until that dude's slipped

2976
01:23:54,611 --> 01:23:56,410
his hand or his pants off in slow motion.

2977
01:23:56,470 --> 01:23:59,860
They got so super slow motion and you
could tell right here where he grabs his

2978
01:23:59,861 --> 01:24:00,280
dick.

2979
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:01,780
You can tell by his hips.

2980
01:24:01,930 --> 01:24:03,550
If you see the quiver on the hips,

2981
01:24:03,730 --> 01:24:06,400
that's an indication of full chap low.

2982
01:24:06,520 --> 01:24:07,061
You want you,

2983
01:24:07,061 --> 01:24:07,840
when you revved up,

2984
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:09,970
you want to go below the helmet line.

2985
01:24:10,110 --> 01:24:13,540
As long as you're below the helmet line
and you've got it all depends on the

2986
01:24:13,541 --> 01:24:13,761
grip.

2987
01:24:13,761 --> 01:24:14,920
Some guys like the Monkey Grip,

2988
01:24:14,921 --> 01:24:16,510
the shaft right there at the base.

2989
01:24:16,690 --> 01:24:18,730
You do it all depends
on size of his penis,

2990
01:24:18,731 --> 01:24:20,110
but you want a among,

2991
01:24:20,130 --> 01:24:21,170
you can monkey grip it.

2992
01:24:21,490 --> 01:24:22,570
You got all these cribs.

2993
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:27,580
Can imagine the interview.

2994
01:24:28,110 --> 01:24:30,070
You know I had to wait
two weeks of training.

2995
01:24:30,071 --> 01:24:31,030
It was last minute.

2996
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:32,130
My,

2997
01:24:32,130 --> 01:24:34,690
my tick was not in good shape.

2998
01:24:35,510 --> 01:24:40,510
Jerked off in two weeks this time to like
do things your dick to toughen it up.

2999
01:24:43,180 --> 01:24:43,461
I've been,

3000
01:24:43,461 --> 01:24:44,180
you know this,

3001
01:24:44,180 --> 01:24:45,080
this time I had a tall,

3002
01:24:45,090 --> 01:24:46,390
a full camp to prepare,

3003
01:24:46,450 --> 01:24:48,010
been jerking off three times a day.

3004
01:24:48,011 --> 01:24:50,990
So this time it can be a little different
and I'm going to come with my head

3005
01:24:50,991 --> 01:24:51,400
game.

3006
01:24:51,400 --> 01:24:52,960
My Dick is he gained,

3007
01:24:54,210 --> 01:24:54,580
hey,

3008
01:24:54,580 --> 01:24:56,850
game strong dude.

3009
01:24:56,900 --> 01:24:59,530
We seen the Kakapo
fucking checking the oil.

3010
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:00,393
You know what I mean?

3011
01:25:00,610 --> 01:25:01,443
You know they could,

3012
01:25:01,990 --> 01:25:02,860
that's illegal.

3013
01:25:02,861 --> 01:25:04,960
You could grab the tick and
the balls but you can't,

3014
01:25:04,961 --> 01:25:06,250
you can't check out.

3015
01:25:06,270 --> 01:25:10,030
You can't stick your thumb in the rules
on checking the oil because guys have

3016
01:25:10,031 --> 01:25:11,530
gotten like in trouble for that.

3017
01:25:11,531 --> 01:25:14,650
Like didn't guys get arrested for um,

3018
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:15,940
for assault,

3019
01:25:16,060 --> 01:25:17,440
for checking some kids oil.

3020
01:25:17,590 --> 01:25:21,940
Didn't some two dudes wrestling and
one kid check the kids oil and he got

3021
01:25:21,941 --> 01:25:22,930
arrested for assault.

3022
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:25,070
I'm pretty sure that
really happened or I drink,

3023
01:25:25,110 --> 01:25:27,340
you need to explain or
checking the oil and gas.

3024
01:25:27,341 --> 01:25:27,851
I do.

3025
01:25:27,851 --> 01:25:32,380
Checking your oil means when you are
grappling with a gentleman and you are

3026
01:25:32,381 --> 01:25:33,430
behind him,

3027
01:25:33,610 --> 01:25:38,610
you shoved with your fingers
inside his bum hole in wrestling.

3028
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:40,730
We're not sure if that's or not,

3029
01:25:40,750 --> 01:25:41,530
but they do it.

3030
01:25:41,530 --> 01:25:42,550
They do it all the time.

3031
01:25:42,551 --> 01:25:43,690
This is a really radical,

3032
01:25:45,370 --> 01:25:50,370
it's a woman and she's like going full
Tarzan on this girl's asshole and she's

3033
01:25:50,471 --> 01:25:51,400
not even flinching.

3034
01:25:51,401 --> 01:25:51,880
Look at that.

3035
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:52,570
She's like,

3036
01:25:52,570 --> 01:25:53,021
bitch,

3037
01:25:53,021 --> 01:25:53,681
this is not the,

3038
01:25:53,681 --> 01:25:54,514
she likes it.

3039
01:25:55,170 --> 01:25:56,003
Um,

3040
01:25:56,080 --> 01:25:56,561
I think,

3041
01:25:56,561 --> 01:25:57,250
uh,

3042
01:25:57,250 --> 01:26:01,360
the woman on top is definitely
doing something questionable.

3043
01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:02,690
Uh,

3044
01:26:02,690 --> 01:26:06,260
who am to judge legal
though in Turkish oil.

3045
01:26:06,261 --> 01:26:07,740
I want to know the rules of Turkish.

3046
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:08,833
Can someone

3047
01:26:10,310 --> 01:26:11,760
who kills someone,

3048
01:26:12,020 --> 01:26:13,760
someone tweet me please.

3049
01:26:13,970 --> 01:26:16,640
If you could find the
rules to Turkish oil,

3050
01:26:16,790 --> 01:26:17,421
Chippendale's,

3051
01:26:17,421 --> 01:26:18,254
wrestling.

3052
01:26:20,180 --> 01:26:21,110
I'm curious.

3053
01:26:21,290 --> 01:26:21,771
Yeah.

3054
01:26:21,771 --> 01:26:22,604
Right.

3055
01:26:24,210 --> 01:26:25,500
What a great sport.

3056
01:26:25,710 --> 01:26:27,840
So how come they can't
have that in the Olympics,

3057
01:26:27,841 --> 01:26:29,910
but they can have that
women's volleyball bullshit.

3058
01:26:29,940 --> 01:26:30,773
It's a sexist,

3059
01:26:31,380 --> 01:26:32,280
total sexism.

3060
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:33,300
It's all we need.

3061
01:26:33,301 --> 01:26:34,170
This is what we need.

3062
01:26:34,290 --> 01:26:39,290
We need one flamboyantly gay star who
wants to compete and they won't let him

3063
01:26:41,131 --> 01:26:41,401
in.

3064
01:26:41,401 --> 01:26:44,790
And it becomes like a global
worldwide cause where people,

3065
01:26:44,820 --> 01:26:45,150
uh,

3066
01:26:45,150 --> 01:26:45,870
you know,

3067
01:26:45,870 --> 01:26:48,870
they'd demand diversity and um,

3068
01:26:48,900 --> 01:26:50,160
what are the quality

3069
01:26:50,180 --> 01:26:51,280
it would have?

3070
01:26:51,281 --> 01:26:52,340
It's shooting to be gay.

3071
01:26:52,460 --> 01:26:53,360
So they got a lie.

3072
01:26:53,361 --> 01:26:55,550
They're saying they're straight friends,

3073
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:56,750
girlfriends.

3074
01:26:56,750 --> 01:27:00,050
It's been proven that when you
wrestle a gay man and he starts to,

3075
01:27:00,051 --> 01:27:02,240
when your testosterone
drops significantly.

3076
01:27:02,630 --> 01:27:02,991
Yes.

3077
01:27:02,991 --> 01:27:04,280
It's been proven in science,

3078
01:27:04,630 --> 01:27:05,540
in the labs.

3079
01:27:05,690 --> 01:27:08,750
So it's almost like cheating
because it's like anti steroids.

3080
01:27:08,990 --> 01:27:10,790
Cause when you getting
whooped on by gay dude,

3081
01:27:10,820 --> 01:27:12,320
you start getting so meek.

3082
01:27:12,620 --> 01:27:15,560
It's like the nature's
preparing you to be as bitch.

3083
01:27:15,830 --> 01:27:16,320
Yeah.

3084
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:18,900
And there's no one true and
there's no way you could.

3085
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:19,260
Okay.

3086
01:27:19,260 --> 01:27:20,130
Guy Can even be,

3087
01:27:21,020 --> 01:27:22,520
he looked at me like it's real question.

3088
01:27:22,940 --> 01:27:23,481
What does this,

3089
01:27:23,481 --> 01:27:23,930
Jamie,

3090
01:27:23,930 --> 01:27:24,763
are these the rules?

3091
01:27:24,770 --> 01:27:27,080
wrestling.com and check out number three.

3092
01:27:27,170 --> 01:27:28,130
These are alternatives.

3093
01:27:29,150 --> 01:27:30,080
Can you read that Joe,

3094
01:27:30,081 --> 01:27:30,861
for the audience?

3095
01:27:30,861 --> 01:27:32,090
This is very bizarre.

3096
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:32,900
It says,

3097
01:27:32,900 --> 01:27:33,733
uh,

3098
01:27:33,950 --> 01:27:38,950
the crush of fighter may maneuver
his opponent onto his stomach.

3099
01:27:40,820 --> 01:27:41,210
What?

3100
01:27:41,210 --> 01:27:41,561
Jamie,

3101
01:27:41,561 --> 01:27:44,600
can you make that bigger
and then trap himself?

3102
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:46,010
Why is it all so blurry?

3103
01:27:46,250 --> 01:27:47,960
It's not that blurry spa.

3104
01:27:47,990 --> 01:27:48,651
You get your glasses.

3105
01:27:48,651 --> 01:27:49,081
I don't have,

3106
01:27:49,081 --> 01:27:50,900
I don't even have my glasses
on and I could read that.

3107
01:27:50,901 --> 01:27:52,250
I'm shocked myself.

3108
01:27:52,280 --> 01:27:53,510
You can keep him down.

3109
01:27:53,940 --> 01:27:54,100
Well,

3110
01:27:54,100 --> 01:27:54,561
what are the,

3111
01:27:54,561 --> 01:27:55,550
what are the rules against it?

3112
01:27:55,551 --> 01:27:56,061
Submission.

3113
01:27:56,061 --> 01:28:00,560
Occasionally the match under a hot
summer sun so long and arduous that one

3114
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:04,250
fightable simply signal his submission
to the referee and it's a pin.

3115
01:28:04,640 --> 01:28:08,390
Since the wrestlers not restricted from
placing his hands inside his opponents

3116
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:09,433
kiss bit,

3117
01:28:09,770 --> 01:28:13,550
he may not grab his balls
or invade his rectum.

3118
01:28:14,270 --> 01:28:15,103
However,

3119
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:19,520
however he may yacht grab his
balls or invade his rectum,

3120
01:28:19,521 --> 01:28:21,050
however he can.

3121
01:28:21,100 --> 01:28:21,590
Oh,

3122
01:28:21,590 --> 01:28:25,550
he can also use to waistband band
over the other man to get to,

3123
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:27,200
to hold the other man in place.

3124
01:28:27,350 --> 01:28:27,920
Okay,

3125
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:30,780
so you can't grab their balls in there
and Dick in their ass hole right there.

3126
01:28:31,130 --> 01:28:32,030
If you lose your trunks,

3127
01:28:32,031 --> 01:28:32,864
you lose the match.

3128
01:28:32,900 --> 01:28:33,320
Oh,

3129
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:34,400
if a guy takes her pants off,

3130
01:28:36,490 --> 01:28:37,323
dude,

3131
01:28:37,330 --> 01:28:38,260
can you imagine?

3132
01:28:38,350 --> 01:28:41,370
It's even worse than not
on and grab the balls.

3133
01:28:42,670 --> 01:28:44,830
It's even worse because the cheaters,

3134
01:28:45,010 --> 01:28:45,241
dude,

3135
01:28:45,241 --> 01:28:48,010
the cheaters in the sport are
always going to be the guys.

3136
01:28:48,190 --> 01:28:49,450
And how are you going to prove it?

3137
01:28:49,451 --> 01:28:51,040
There must be a guy in the sport,

3138
01:28:52,050 --> 01:28:53,440
the worst cheater ever.

3139
01:28:53,650 --> 01:28:54,520
There's got to be,

3140
01:28:54,670 --> 01:28:55,210
listen,

3141
01:28:55,210 --> 01:28:56,410
listen to the actual rule.

3142
01:28:56,620 --> 01:28:58,840
Occasionally the Kismet is yanked.

3143
01:28:58,910 --> 01:28:59,950
So the carpet,

3144
01:29:00,010 --> 01:29:01,060
what is the thing that he wears?

3145
01:29:01,290 --> 01:29:02,040
Leather

3146
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:07,040
restup pass is dropped so far below his
hips that the fighter being held cannot

3147
01:29:08,911 --> 01:29:11,310
rise without exposing himself,

3148
01:29:11,490 --> 01:29:13,050
having lost his trunks.

3149
01:29:13,051 --> 01:29:14,580
He also loses the match.

3150
01:29:14,740 --> 01:29:14,891
Oh,

3151
01:29:14,891 --> 01:29:16,530
you could pull down the trunks,

3152
01:29:18,100 --> 01:29:18,940
you lose the match.

3153
01:29:19,060 --> 01:29:19,920
Maybe this is like,

3154
01:29:20,330 --> 01:29:21,163
you're always like,

3155
01:29:21,700 --> 01:29:25,390
you could reach inside but you can't
touch the asshole or the Dick and I'm sure

3156
01:29:25,391 --> 01:29:27,880
no one breaks that rule ever,

3157
01:29:28,300 --> 01:29:28,661
ever,

3158
01:29:28,661 --> 01:29:28,991
ever,

3159
01:29:28,991 --> 01:29:29,291
ever,

3160
01:29:29,291 --> 01:29:29,621
ever,

3161
01:29:29,621 --> 01:29:30,040
ever.

3162
01:29:30,040 --> 01:29:31,230
It's better that they're there,

3163
01:29:34,030 --> 01:29:37,000
but they're not allowed
to pulls your pants off.

3164
01:29:37,001 --> 01:29:37,511
He wins.

3165
01:29:37,511 --> 01:29:39,520
Can you imagine the discussions?

3166
01:29:39,521 --> 01:29:40,354
A podcast,

3167
01:29:40,540 --> 01:29:42,700
there must be podcasts about this sport,

3168
01:29:42,701 --> 01:29:45,340
like dudes that are seriously into
it and they're talking about like,

3169
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:45,641
you know,

3170
01:29:45,641 --> 01:29:47,760
we're talking about like
no need a down opponent,

3171
01:29:47,770 --> 01:29:48,220
all that.

3172
01:29:48,220 --> 01:29:52,720
They're talking about that the elephant
in the room is the fact that everyone's

3173
01:29:52,810 --> 01:29:56,170
sticking fingers and everyone's an
asshole and everyone's grabbing balls.

3174
01:29:56,171 --> 01:29:58,210
But no one's complaining
because everyone just does it.

3175
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:01,810
And so there's no
complaints like in football,

3176
01:30:02,020 --> 01:30:04,640
like the defensive cornerback when there,

3177
01:30:04,641 --> 01:30:05,860
there's a receiver going out,

3178
01:30:05,950 --> 01:30:09,040
you're not supposed to hit
him outside of five yards,

3179
01:30:09,250 --> 01:30:11,830
but they're hitting him all
the time and running into them.

3180
01:30:11,830 --> 01:30:12,760
And when they throw passes,

3181
01:30:12,761 --> 01:30:13,281
they're all over.

3182
01:30:13,281 --> 01:30:13,540
Right.

3183
01:30:13,540 --> 01:30:14,350
So they're like,

3184
01:30:14,350 --> 01:30:16,720
and they call it sometimes
and sometimes they don't.

3185
01:30:16,721 --> 01:30:17,380
And there's a,

3186
01:30:17,380 --> 01:30:18,580
there's big controversy,

3187
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:19,271
you know,

3188
01:30:19,271 --> 01:30:19,511
like,

3189
01:30:19,511 --> 01:30:20,080
you know,

3190
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:21,570
there's a panist pass interference,

3191
01:30:21,580 --> 01:30:22,540
but no one's calling it.

3192
01:30:22,541 --> 01:30:23,261
It's a weird thing.

3193
01:30:23,261 --> 01:30:25,150
They call it every now and then when it's,

3194
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:26,140
when it's playing,

3195
01:30:26,140 --> 01:30:27,520
when it's really obvious.

3196
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:31,570
So there must be like tips of
fingers going into the rectum,

3197
01:30:31,571 --> 01:30:32,620
but they don't call that,

3198
01:30:32,710 --> 01:30:36,070
they never call the tips and it's got
to be full knuckle deep to call it.

3199
01:30:36,460 --> 01:30:37,760
And that's a problem line.

3200
01:30:37,780 --> 01:30:40,270
You have to cross 10 like a finger line.

3201
01:30:40,460 --> 01:30:41,770
Nobody puts the tip in.

3202
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:43,091
Tip is fine,

3203
01:30:43,091 --> 01:30:43,924
dude,

3204
01:30:44,110 --> 01:30:44,501
dude,

3205
01:30:44,501 --> 01:30:44,770
there's,

3206
01:30:44,770 --> 01:30:46,300
there's gotta be world championships.

3207
01:30:46,360 --> 01:30:48,190
I want to see like a super fight,

3208
01:30:48,370 --> 01:30:51,910
like the baddest dudes and do like a
countdown show on these guys and how they

3209
01:30:51,911 --> 01:30:52,630
train.

3210
01:30:52,630 --> 01:30:53,470
I don't want to see that.

3211
01:30:53,770 --> 01:30:55,240
I would watch that shit.

3212
01:30:55,990 --> 01:30:56,440
Well,

3213
01:30:56,440 --> 01:30:56,880
don't,

3214
01:30:56,880 --> 01:30:59,770
there's one thing that you have
to think about when you do like,

3215
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:00,191
yeah,

3216
01:31:00,191 --> 01:31:02,770
it's a little weird that the grab each
other and the pants and it's a little

3217
01:31:02,771 --> 01:31:03,101
weird.

3218
01:31:03,101 --> 01:31:04,150
They're covered in oil,

3219
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:06,250
but you gotta be,

3220
01:31:06,640 --> 01:31:10,480
you must have to be really fucking
good at wrestling to control a dude is

3221
01:31:10,481 --> 01:31:11,020
greased up.

3222
01:31:11,020 --> 01:31:13,570
We need to get the best motherfucker and
that sport and bring them over to the

3223
01:31:13,571 --> 01:31:14,620
UFC and see what's up.

3224
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:15,880
How good do you think they are?

3225
01:31:15,881 --> 01:31:16,121
I mean,

3226
01:31:16,121 --> 01:31:21,121
are there any real legit like oil wrestler
athletes who people like this guy is

3227
01:31:21,431 --> 01:31:24,820
like the bad motherfucker
of oil restaurant is like,

3228
01:31:25,030 --> 01:31:25,850
who's that guy?

3229
01:31:25,850 --> 01:31:26,330
Who's those?

3230
01:31:26,330 --> 01:31:27,520
He's got soccer gasoline,

3231
01:31:28,270 --> 01:31:29,090
the messy.

3232
01:31:29,090 --> 01:31:30,280
He's the Rinaldo.

3233
01:31:30,281 --> 01:31:30,910
Who's the,

3234
01:31:30,910 --> 01:31:31,770
who's the [inaudible]?

3235
01:31:31,910 --> 01:31:33,360
What is his name was Leah and I,

3236
01:31:33,430 --> 01:31:34,263
what is it?

3237
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:35,680
Just Leo Messi.

3238
01:31:35,680 --> 01:31:36,400
Leo Messi.

3239
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:39,010
That Leo Messi Guy who's the
baddest motherfucker in soccer.

3240
01:31:39,370 --> 01:31:41,020
If there's one of those
dudes for oil restaurant,

3241
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:43,900
he's just just raining down.

3242
01:31:44,330 --> 01:31:45,130
There's got to be,

3243
01:31:45,130 --> 01:31:48,160
who is the Hixon Gracie
of all Turkish oil,

3244
01:31:48,490 --> 01:31:49,323
uh,

3245
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:50,020
wrestling.

3246
01:31:50,020 --> 01:31:50,261
Well,

3247
01:31:50,261 --> 01:31:51,940
Turkish people are tough people.

3248
01:31:52,090 --> 01:31:52,920
You know.

3249
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:54,580
It's a tough part of the world.

3250
01:31:54,790 --> 01:31:59,790
So you've got to think it's
a long heritage of having
like fighting from Turkey.

3251
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:02,990
They're like known for being like,

3252
01:32:03,490 --> 01:32:04,690
like rugged people.

3253
01:32:04,691 --> 01:32:06,680
So you gotta think if
they know how to like,

3254
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:10,720
like that style of wrestling that they do.

3255
01:32:10,721 --> 01:32:13,480
I wonder if it's just one of those things
where it's just you invented something

3256
01:32:13,481 --> 01:32:18,481
I'll long fucking time ago and
it never sort of like caught up.

3257
01:32:19,030 --> 01:32:21,970
I want to know who the
Ronda Rousey of hot oil,

3258
01:32:21,971 --> 01:32:23,100
Turkish wrestling is.

3259
01:32:23,200 --> 01:32:24,490
I'd watch that right now.

3260
01:32:24,730 --> 01:32:27,610
I paid 49 99 paper view for that shit.

3261
01:32:27,870 --> 01:32:30,220
The male Turkish lot oil wrestling.

3262
01:32:30,370 --> 01:32:31,080
That'd be insane.

3263
01:32:31,080 --> 01:32:31,960
It's gotta be a little,

3264
01:32:31,961 --> 01:32:33,310
there's gotta be girls doing it.

3265
01:32:34,300 --> 01:32:35,120
There's a market there.

3266
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:35,953
Probably ugliest.

3267
01:32:36,460 --> 01:32:37,201
They don't have to be,

3268
01:32:37,201 --> 01:32:38,034
I'd probably be like,

3269
01:32:38,350 --> 01:32:38,531
no,

3270
01:32:38,531 --> 01:32:38,680
no,

3271
01:32:38,680 --> 01:32:38,831
no.

3272
01:32:38,831 --> 01:32:39,700
They don't have to be man.

3273
01:32:39,720 --> 01:32:41,420
Oh you just need this one.

3274
01:32:41,421 --> 01:32:43,670
So right promoter commencement ship.

3275
01:32:43,690 --> 01:32:48,690
Just picking because I think the object
of the game is to get that hip lock and

3276
01:32:49,690 --> 01:32:53,140
get some kind of ball and
socket in between their legs
right next to their nuts

3277
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:54,430
and lift him up.

3278
01:32:55,090 --> 01:32:58,180
And I think if you lift them up for yeah,

3279
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:00,660
for sure you can't.

3280
01:33:00,661 --> 01:33:00,940
Um,

3281
01:33:00,940 --> 01:33:04,360
there's gotta be a Joanna how
judge a chick a of that sport.

3282
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:07,090
You can't take a dude's pants
off if he's beating your ass.

3283
01:33:08,380 --> 01:33:08,910
Right.

3284
01:33:08,910 --> 01:33:10,480
So maybe that's like your pants off.

3285
01:33:10,481 --> 01:33:11,191
He's Kinda got,

3286
01:33:11,191 --> 01:33:11,650
yeah.

3287
01:33:11,650 --> 01:33:14,400
Do you think you could flip a million?

3288
01:33:15,610 --> 01:33:16,331
Maybe it's like,

3289
01:33:16,331 --> 01:33:16,930
uh,

3290
01:33:16,930 --> 01:33:18,190
maybe it's like a,

3291
01:33:18,790 --> 01:33:19,600
like an ENT,

3292
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:22,240
like in case there's a
war against the gays,

3293
01:33:22,270 --> 01:33:24,850
like whoever gets a
pants taken down first,

3294
01:33:25,390 --> 01:33:26,050
I don't know.

3295
01:33:26,050 --> 01:33:27,220
I'm just speculating.

3296
01:33:27,340 --> 01:33:28,173
It could be,

3297
01:33:30,360 --> 01:33:31,193
hey,

3298
01:33:31,610 --> 01:33:32,443
you know what?

3299
01:33:32,590 --> 01:33:33,400
Whoever wins,

3300
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:36,460
whoever is the baddest
motherfucker at that sport,

3301
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:37,210
right?

3302
01:33:37,210 --> 01:33:41,460
They have no fear of getting
a gang raped by sure.

3303
01:33:41,980 --> 01:33:44,590
Vicious gay dudes especially
cause there's just,

3304
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:49,800
you never get that oil off the
street gang of gay Jujitsu,

3305
01:33:50,081 --> 01:33:50,541
black belt.

3306
01:33:50,541 --> 01:33:51,670
We can imagine that.

3307
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:53,590
And they taught,

3308
01:33:53,590 --> 01:33:56,770
they teach Jujitsu to have sex with men.

3309
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:57,101
Okay.

3310
01:33:57,101 --> 01:33:59,270
What would be scarier that or

3311
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:05,190
go to [inaudible] in West Hollywood.

3312
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:07,230
That was of Greece,

3313
01:34:07,231 --> 01:34:07,541
dup,

3314
01:34:07,541 --> 01:34:08,291
Melvin man.

3315
01:34:08,291 --> 01:34:11,590
Hoofs greased up with
good takedown defense.

3316
01:34:11,620 --> 01:34:12,100
Ooh.

3317
01:34:12,100 --> 01:34:14,140
Completely greased up in West Hollywood.

3318
01:34:14,360 --> 01:34:15,520
Where ever he wants to go.

3319
01:34:15,580 --> 01:34:16,720
He'll go wherever the fuck he want.

3320
01:34:16,721 --> 01:34:17,920
One dude or a bunch of dudes,

3321
01:34:18,130 --> 01:34:18,850
seven of them.

3322
01:34:18,850 --> 01:34:20,090
They look just like Melvin man.

3323
01:34:20,110 --> 01:34:23,040
They're looking for dudes
to Caltrain man have clones.

3324
01:34:23,680 --> 01:34:23,941
Yeah.

3325
01:34:23,941 --> 01:34:26,530
That's where he scaring
the Mexican gang bangers.

3326
01:34:26,920 --> 01:34:31,270
I'll make a beeline for east la
any time this got to east La.

3327
01:34:31,270 --> 01:34:32,103
Fuck that.

3328
01:34:32,260 --> 01:34:33,820
Greasy rest live is one thing,

3329
01:34:33,821 --> 01:34:36,220
but greasy Melvin Manhoef
throwing bombs on you.

3330
01:34:36,280 --> 01:34:36,950
Yes.

3331
01:34:36,950 --> 01:34:39,010
I didn't want any once your juicy,

3332
01:34:39,011 --> 01:34:40,550
precious the rectum,

3333
01:34:42,070 --> 01:34:43,030
that's their goal.

3334
01:34:43,150 --> 01:34:45,060
They got big patches of rectums on their,

3335
01:34:45,070 --> 01:34:47,620
their their denim jackets and
you can't keep him off you.

3336
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:48,300
Yeah.

3337
01:34:48,300 --> 01:34:52,870
He was one of those guys where I met
him at the UFC like as a kickboxing fan.

3338
01:34:52,930 --> 01:34:53,381
I was.

3339
01:34:53,381 --> 01:34:53,890
I was.

3340
01:34:53,890 --> 01:34:54,850
I was giddy man.

3341
01:34:55,060 --> 01:34:56,560
I come up to him and shake his hand.

3342
01:34:56,950 --> 01:34:57,440
It was good too.

3343
01:34:57,440 --> 01:34:58,340
I'm a huge

3344
01:34:58,340 --> 01:34:58,970
fan.

3345
01:34:58,970 --> 01:35:00,110
I'm a huge fan.

3346
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:02,240
Isn't it weird that he
never got into the UFC?

3347
01:35:02,330 --> 01:35:03,163
That's strange.

3348
01:35:03,170 --> 01:35:03,321
Well,

3349
01:35:03,321 --> 01:35:08,090
it got to the strike force and Robbie
Lawler had that ridiculously insane Kale

3350
01:35:08,091 --> 01:35:08,391
of him.

3351
01:35:08,391 --> 01:35:10,970
You remember that Robby Lawler
there isn't that condit fight.

3352
01:35:12,350 --> 01:35:12,921
Um,

3353
01:35:12,921 --> 01:35:15,890
but Melvin Manhoef highlight
reel is ridiculous.

3354
01:35:16,130 --> 01:35:18,500
Kickboxing and MMA highlight reel.

3355
01:35:19,220 --> 01:35:21,350
The hardest one to watch
for me with a soccer raba.

3356
01:35:21,620 --> 01:35:22,453
Remember that one?

3357
01:35:24,230 --> 01:35:24,830
What happened?

3358
01:35:24,830 --> 01:35:27,100
He beat the shit out of soccer,

3359
01:35:27,101 --> 01:35:27,410
Robert.

3360
01:35:27,410 --> 01:35:27,841
It was soccer,

3361
01:35:27,841 --> 01:35:29,800
but late in his career and soccer,

3362
01:35:29,801 --> 01:35:30,450
I have a loss.

3363
01:35:30,450 --> 01:35:31,610
I was a horrible law.

3364
01:35:32,210 --> 01:35:33,500
It was soccer kicks,

3365
01:35:34,010 --> 01:35:35,660
soccer kicks and hammer fist.

3366
01:35:35,930 --> 01:35:37,880
They take soccer kicks out of one FC.

3367
01:35:38,320 --> 01:35:39,320
Didn't you hear about that day?

3368
01:35:39,321 --> 01:35:39,921
When was this?

3369
01:35:39,921 --> 01:35:40,700
They changed it.

3370
01:35:40,700 --> 01:35:41,271
They took it out.

3371
01:35:41,271 --> 01:35:42,170
When did they do this?

3372
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:43,700
Unless it's some hoax.

3373
01:35:43,730 --> 01:35:44,900
But I think I read that,

3374
01:35:44,901 --> 01:35:45,411
that one of,

3375
01:35:45,411 --> 01:35:48,350
see the thing that
separated them from the UFC,

3376
01:35:48,351 --> 01:35:50,480
like at least in one fc
was kind of pride ish.

3377
01:35:50,600 --> 01:35:53,090
But they had that weird rule
where they had to call it.

3378
01:35:53,450 --> 01:35:53,840
I,

3379
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:54,051
I,

3380
01:35:54,051 --> 01:35:54,470
you know,

3381
01:35:54,470 --> 01:35:57,830
I feel like Tate had
this point first and uh,

3382
01:35:57,831 --> 01:35:58,664
I've,

3383
01:35:58,820 --> 01:36:03,590
I've never heard anybody accurately
refuted that the problem with stomps and

3384
01:36:03,591 --> 01:36:05,240
soccer kicks in a ring

3385
01:36:06,860 --> 01:36:07,850
or in a cage rather,

3386
01:36:07,880 --> 01:36:10,670
is that you can't get out away
from them like you do in a ring.

3387
01:36:10,671 --> 01:36:12,260
Like the cage becomes a problem.

3388
01:36:12,261 --> 01:36:13,250
Like you get trapped,

3389
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:15,620
you get caught in a
couple spots in the ring,

3390
01:36:15,950 --> 01:36:19,010
but you should be able to move your head
out of the way enough to compensate for

3391
01:36:19,011 --> 01:36:20,750
wherever the ring the ring posts are.

3392
01:36:21,330 --> 01:36:21,620
Look.

3393
01:36:21,620 --> 01:36:24,770
But the idea of getting stuck in the cage,

3394
01:36:24,771 --> 01:36:25,581
we can't move.

3395
01:36:25,581 --> 01:36:27,540
And then getting need to that where the,

3396
01:36:27,541 --> 01:36:30,200
the environment becomes
too big of a factor.

3397
01:36:30,470 --> 01:36:32,000
And I thought about
what he said and I said,

3398
01:36:32,001 --> 01:36:33,320
that makes a lot of sense.

3399
01:36:33,410 --> 01:36:34,730
A skull could crush,

3400
01:36:35,030 --> 01:36:39,890
could be just squashed thinking about
like what Michael Page did to Cyborg and

3401
01:36:39,891 --> 01:36:42,710
think of someone doing that
to someone's face in the UFC,

3402
01:36:42,711 --> 01:36:43,150
which again,

3403
01:36:43,150 --> 01:36:46,220
when the faith see someone's face
caved in and what if they cheat?

3404
01:36:46,430 --> 01:36:48,020
What if someone cheats in
the heat of the battle?

3405
01:36:48,021 --> 01:36:49,520
Maybe don't even realize they did it,

3406
01:36:49,521 --> 01:36:52,700
but they grabbed that fence and it
helps them drive that knee down.

3407
01:36:53,030 --> 01:36:54,650
You know that's happened before.

3408
01:36:54,740 --> 01:36:55,490
If you could,

3409
01:36:55,490 --> 01:36:59,880
if you got a guy who was
almost unconscious and he's
on his way out and you grab

3410
01:36:59,881 --> 01:37:03,680
the fence and you some mash your
knee down with all your body,

3411
01:37:03,681 --> 01:37:04,700
you get your hips up in the air.

3412
01:37:04,790 --> 01:37:08,090
Like George Saint Pierre when he fought
Matt Serra and the rematch and Montreal,

3413
01:37:08,270 --> 01:37:11,240
remember that those knees to
the body from side control,

3414
01:37:11,241 --> 01:37:12,770
just go deep with those knees.

3415
01:37:12,850 --> 01:37:13,700
Boom.

3416
01:37:14,060 --> 01:37:18,260
If a guy does that to a guy on the ground
and he's actually holding the fence,

3417
01:37:18,950 --> 01:37:19,700
that's,

3418
01:37:19,700 --> 01:37:22,820
that's a terrible place to be as a terror.

3419
01:37:22,850 --> 01:37:23,990
There's like nowhere to go.

3420
01:37:23,991 --> 01:37:25,490
It's like everything's
just getting absorbed.

3421
01:37:25,640 --> 01:37:27,200
It's the worst way ever to get hit.

3422
01:37:27,470 --> 01:37:28,050
It's almost like,

3423
01:37:28,050 --> 01:37:28,340
uh,

3424
01:37:28,340 --> 01:37:30,290
an argument for not having a cage.

3425
01:37:30,500 --> 01:37:34,190
I've said this before and people think
I'm an idiot and it probably right some

3426
01:37:34,191 --> 01:37:34,970
of the time,

3427
01:37:34,970 --> 01:37:39,440
but I think that MMA should be
in like basketball size place.

3428
01:37:39,650 --> 01:37:40,011
Like you know,

3429
01:37:40,011 --> 01:37:42,200
you have a basketball court
and you're watching the game.

3430
01:37:42,950 --> 01:37:44,930
I really think MMA should be a flat,

3431
01:37:45,290 --> 01:37:50,290
padded area with no fence and they
should go at it and a large area.

3432
01:37:50,690 --> 01:37:52,490
So there's plenty of room to move around.

3433
01:37:52,491 --> 01:37:54,440
There's no excuse to go
into the crowd like that.

3434
01:37:54,770 --> 01:37:55,680
That's how they should do it.

3435
01:37:56,010 --> 01:37:57,150
So take downs,

3436
01:37:57,151 --> 01:37:58,830
defense submissions,

3437
01:37:58,920 --> 01:38:02,040
there's no getting off the fence and
pushing off of it and flipping over and

3438
01:38:02,041 --> 01:38:03,030
getting out of positions.

3439
01:38:03,270 --> 01:38:06,390
Everything will take place
on a flat neutral ground.

3440
01:38:06,900 --> 01:38:09,900
And I think you're going to find a lot
of fucking people going to have a real

3441
01:38:09,901 --> 01:38:11,040
hard time with wrestlers.

3442
01:38:11,580 --> 01:38:16,320
Real hard time with wrestlers like real
elite wrestlers when they keep driving

3443
01:38:16,321 --> 01:38:18,900
forward and you can only go back so much,

3444
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:20,850
you know there's no cage anymore.

3445
01:38:20,851 --> 01:38:22,290
You can't push off the cage.

3446
01:38:22,291 --> 01:38:24,150
How bout this again,

3447
01:38:24,151 --> 01:38:25,260
this is all fantasy.

3448
01:38:25,770 --> 01:38:26,670
How about somebody,

3449
01:38:26,671 --> 01:38:29,170
maybe you maybe someone else with a um,

3450
01:38:29,270 --> 01:38:32,820
the could financially but to put it
together but go to some God damn Indian

3451
01:38:32,821 --> 01:38:35,850
reservation when you could do
anything you want put together,

3452
01:38:35,880 --> 01:38:36,713
show,

3453
01:38:36,720 --> 01:38:37,920
put together a show,

3454
01:38:38,130 --> 01:38:38,671
one show.

3455
01:38:38,671 --> 01:38:39,810
It doesn't have to be elite fighters.

3456
01:38:39,811 --> 01:38:41,640
You don't put that much put together show.

3457
01:38:42,210 --> 01:38:46,740
You got to show them how it's done because
one thing I learned with Ebi is when

3458
01:38:46,741 --> 01:38:50,370
I was presenting the overtime
rules and all that to everybody,

3459
01:38:51,090 --> 01:38:54,330
nobody even thought it
was cool for a second.

3460
01:38:54,580 --> 01:38:55,530
I talked to them.

3461
01:38:55,531 --> 01:38:57,420
Explain Ebi for people to
know what we're talking about.

3462
01:38:57,450 --> 01:38:58,800
Ebi Is Eddie Bravo.

3463
01:38:58,801 --> 01:38:59,700
Invitationals.

3464
01:38:59,701 --> 01:39:04,140
Eddie Bravo's probably got the greatest
Jujitsu tournament in the world as far

3465
01:39:04,141 --> 01:39:07,920
as professional Jujitsu because of
these rules that you implemented.

3466
01:39:08,610 --> 01:39:10,230
September 11th is our next show.

3467
01:39:10,830 --> 01:39:11,581
Gordon Ryan,

3468
01:39:11,581 --> 01:39:14,580
September 11th on UFC fight pass
or you could see it live at the,

3469
01:39:14,730 --> 01:39:15,750
at the Orpheum.

3470
01:39:15,751 --> 01:39:19,980
Get your tickets@ebiofficial.com but
anyways Donaher just send me a text that

3471
01:39:19,981 --> 01:39:20,341
Keenan,

3472
01:39:20,341 --> 01:39:25,341
Cornelius and Ryan Gordon went 90 minutes
and Ryan Gordon submitted him with a

3473
01:39:26,041 --> 01:39:26,874
heel off.

3474
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:30,350
He's been doing Jujitsu like
four and a half years going Ryan.

3475
01:39:30,500 --> 01:39:31,333
Yes,

3476
01:39:31,950 --> 01:39:33,390
I think it's about five something.

3477
01:39:33,410 --> 01:39:34,161
Something Riddick say.

3478
01:39:34,161 --> 01:39:34,994
It's say yes.

3479
01:39:35,030 --> 01:39:35,940
Get Gordon Ryan.

3480
01:39:35,941 --> 01:39:36,750
It's crazy.

3481
01:39:36,750 --> 01:39:37,441
Gordon Ryan,

3482
01:39:37,441 --> 01:39:39,420
he won the absolutely.

3483
01:39:39,480 --> 01:39:43,710
He could be the best Jujitsu fighter
pound for pound in the world right now.

3484
01:39:43,770 --> 01:39:44,760
That could be one.

3485
01:39:44,761 --> 01:39:45,510
The absolute,

3486
01:39:45,510 --> 01:39:46,770
he beat Uri Sibos.

3487
01:39:47,300 --> 01:39:47,490
Uh,

3488
01:39:47,490 --> 01:39:48,870
he beat 'em,

3489
01:39:49,080 --> 01:39:49,530
uh,

3490
01:39:49,530 --> 01:39:52,740
rust them chizzy of who's
a fucking Russian assassin.

3491
01:39:52,770 --> 01:39:53,910
That guys of gorilla,

3492
01:39:54,420 --> 01:39:56,940
literally a gorilla is crazy.

3493
01:39:56,970 --> 01:39:57,803
Yes.

3494
01:39:57,830 --> 01:39:58,663
In the finals,

3495
01:39:58,740 --> 01:39:59,550
the kid,

3496
01:39:59,550 --> 01:40:01,040
the kid has been trained in five years.

3497
01:40:01,110 --> 01:40:01,980
The whiz kid,

3498
01:40:02,040 --> 01:40:04,710
Gordon Ryan versus the Russian bear,

3499
01:40:04,770 --> 01:40:06,150
Russian bear taking it out.

3500
01:40:06,151 --> 01:40:07,200
Everybody on one side,

3501
01:40:07,201 --> 01:40:07,441
Gordon,

3502
01:40:07,441 --> 01:40:07,711
Ryan,

3503
01:40:07,711 --> 01:40:08,491
the kid taken out,

3504
01:40:08,491 --> 01:40:11,090
everybody on this side and then
they met in the finals and Ebi six.

3505
01:40:11,370 --> 01:40:11,880
Well,

3506
01:40:11,880 --> 01:40:12,481
the next show,

3507
01:40:12,481 --> 01:40:14,080
Ebi Seven Gordon Ryan is going,

3508
01:40:14,160 --> 01:40:15,270
we're doing the one 85.

3509
01:40:15,271 --> 01:40:16,110
That was absolute.

3510
01:40:16,170 --> 01:40:17,760
This is the middleweight Gorn Ryan.

3511
01:40:17,761 --> 01:40:19,590
That's his true wait one 85.

3512
01:40:19,950 --> 01:40:20,783
And um,

3513
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:21,630
but anyways,

3514
01:40:21,630 --> 01:40:22,560
enough with that show,

3515
01:40:22,830 --> 01:40:23,160
uh,

3516
01:40:23,160 --> 01:40:24,300
the rules though,

3517
01:40:24,330 --> 01:40:26,310
when I presented the overtime rules,

3518
01:40:26,311 --> 01:40:30,190
I have special overtime rules that are
based on submission and not based on take

3519
01:40:30,200 --> 01:40:30,870
downs.

3520
01:40:30,870 --> 01:40:31,171
Uh,

3521
01:40:31,171 --> 01:40:32,790
it's all about the submission at Ebi.

3522
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:37,380
But when I first pres presented
that like two different promoters,

3523
01:40:37,470 --> 01:40:38,760
nobody wanted to hear it.

3524
01:40:38,970 --> 01:40:39,540
No,

3525
01:40:39,540 --> 01:40:40,870
they didn't even entertain it.

3526
01:40:40,871 --> 01:40:41,970
They thought it was too crazy.

3527
01:40:42,150 --> 01:40:44,100
But now that we put together seven shows,

3528
01:40:44,220 --> 01:40:46,200
now the show people are going,

3529
01:40:46,440 --> 01:40:47,273
oh shit,

3530
01:40:47,340 --> 01:40:47,941
it's legit.

3531
01:40:47,941 --> 01:40:51,840
So everyone jumped on board and people
agree that it's the best way to do

3532
01:40:51,841 --> 01:40:52,301
tournaments.

3533
01:40:52,301 --> 01:40:53,950
It really is because it forces action.

3534
01:40:54,190 --> 01:40:55,150
You can't stall.

3535
01:40:55,270 --> 01:40:58,010
You're starting out in a bad
position at the end when you go into,

3536
01:40:58,570 --> 01:40:59,770
when you go into the overtime,

3537
01:41:00,250 --> 01:41:01,083
um,

3538
01:41:01,120 --> 01:41:03,670
the fights about start and I don't
want to interrupt this fight,

3539
01:41:04,070 --> 01:41:05,830
this fight we'll talk about,

3540
01:41:06,010 --> 01:41:07,330
we'll talk about Dbi afterwards.

3541
01:41:07,331 --> 01:41:10,120
We'll hold please Carlos Condon.

3542
01:41:10,270 --> 01:41:12,390
When he came out the Maya shed,

3543
01:41:12,391 --> 01:41:15,700
I have no fuck and I god Damn Dia.

3544
01:41:15,910 --> 01:41:19,390
For me it's all about
whether Damien Maia this Duh,

3545
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:21,170
but it's all about whether
or not Damien Maia,

3546
01:41:21,171 --> 01:41:23,980
I can get ahold of him if Damien
Maia and get ahold of him.

3547
01:41:24,340 --> 01:41:26,140
He's so big at one 70.

3548
01:41:26,141 --> 01:41:26,650
Dude.

3549
01:41:26,650 --> 01:41:29,770
He's so strong in his Jujitsu.

3550
01:41:29,950 --> 01:41:31,480
He's so good.

3551
01:41:31,780 --> 01:41:32,613
His Jujitsu,

3552
01:41:32,640 --> 01:41:33,473
so pretty.

3553
01:41:33,970 --> 01:41:34,900
When he choked out,

3554
01:41:34,901 --> 01:41:35,734
Neil Magni,

3555
01:41:35,800 --> 01:41:37,060
I remember watching his transition.

3556
01:41:37,061 --> 01:41:37,241
I'm like,

3557
01:41:37,241 --> 01:41:39,220
this guy is a fucking master.

3558
01:41:39,400 --> 01:41:40,420
He's a master.

3559
01:41:40,750 --> 01:41:42,490
But he's the way he's getting the back.

3560
01:41:42,491 --> 01:41:42,611
Like,

3561
01:41:42,611 --> 01:41:43,990
remember when he choked out Rick Story?

3562
01:41:44,200 --> 01:41:46,090
He just cleans to him like glue,

3563
01:41:46,091 --> 01:41:49,360
drags them in the deep water
and sink their boat like that.

3564
01:41:49,400 --> 01:41:49,660
Yeah,

3565
01:41:49,660 --> 01:41:51,570
he keeps getting better with his Jujitsu.

3566
01:41:51,970 --> 01:41:52,391
It.

3567
01:41:52,391 --> 01:41:53,224
Uh,

3568
01:41:53,710 --> 01:41:55,750
do you see what dot Donna
her wrote about on this week?

3569
01:41:55,770 --> 01:41:56,560
Yeah,

3570
01:41:56,560 --> 01:41:57,393
I'll accurate.

3571
01:41:57,670 --> 01:41:58,490
Brilliant.

3572
01:41:58,490 --> 01:41:58,920
Yeah.

3573
01:41:58,920 --> 01:41:59,320
I'm in lab,

3574
01:41:59,320 --> 01:42:01,030
probably has in the UFC.

3575
01:42:01,270 --> 01:42:03,790
He's probably the best Jujitsu player.

3576
01:42:03,791 --> 01:42:05,110
He has the best MMA,

3577
01:42:05,111 --> 01:42:05,740
Jujitsu,

3578
01:42:05,740 --> 01:42:09,060
totally different MMA
digit two and a Nogi.

3579
01:42:09,070 --> 01:42:14,070
Jujitsu is just as different as
Nogi Jiu Jitsu and gauge Jujitsu.

3580
01:42:15,030 --> 01:42:16,300
It's just as different.

3581
01:42:16,360 --> 01:42:20,310
It's so different when someone
is trying to punch you an elbow,

3582
01:42:20,311 --> 01:42:23,860
Lou and everything's all
greasy and slippery and slidey.

3583
01:42:24,160 --> 01:42:25,210
It's so different.

3584
01:42:25,211 --> 01:42:28,990
If you think that's the same
as training and the gay,

3585
01:42:29,530 --> 01:42:31,450
you're just a man.

3586
01:42:31,930 --> 01:42:32,560
You're a,

3587
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:33,690
I don't know what,

3588
01:42:34,120 --> 01:42:34,953
what to say.

3589
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:36,220
Maybe you're just misinformed.

3590
01:42:36,221 --> 01:42:40,060
But Damian Maia has made that transition,

3591
01:42:40,220 --> 01:42:40,900
not it,

3592
01:42:40,900 --> 01:42:41,111
you know,

3593
01:42:41,111 --> 01:42:41,800
right away.

3594
01:42:41,800 --> 01:42:44,290
He was really good at MMA,

3595
01:42:44,291 --> 01:42:45,101
Jujitsu right away.

3596
01:42:45,101 --> 01:42:46,660
He was doing some half guard,

3597
01:42:46,810 --> 01:42:47,611
that stuff and,

3598
01:42:47,611 --> 01:42:48,191
and the UFC,

3599
01:42:48,191 --> 01:42:48,821
that was very,

3600
01:42:48,821 --> 01:42:51,010
very effective back in the day,

3601
01:42:51,010 --> 01:42:51,340
years and years ago.

3602
01:42:51,340 --> 01:42:53,560
But even as good as he was,

3603
01:42:53,650 --> 01:42:55,840
he was one of the top guys
to make the transition.

3604
01:42:55,841 --> 01:42:57,340
Initially even as good as he was,

3605
01:42:57,400 --> 01:42:59,530
he continued to evolve.

3606
01:42:59,531 --> 01:43:03,280
And as Jujitsu now is better
than ever on the ground.

3607
01:43:03,400 --> 01:43:04,990
But that being said,

3608
01:43:05,080 --> 01:43:06,820
Carlos condit is very good on the ground.

3609
01:43:06,940 --> 01:43:08,590
Even a Damien Maia does take him down.

3610
01:43:08,680 --> 01:43:11,470
He might not be able to
pass Carlos Condit his card.

3611
01:43:11,590 --> 01:43:12,820
He might not be able to pass it.

3612
01:43:13,870 --> 01:43:18,100
The big dangers in the standup because
Carlos throw some nasty elbows and you

3613
01:43:18,101 --> 01:43:21,760
gotta think he stopped Tiago Alvarez
recently looked real good and that fight

3614
01:43:21,761 --> 01:43:23,500
stopped him with that stepping in elbow.

3615
01:43:23,680 --> 01:43:24,700
He's nasty dude.

3616
01:43:24,730 --> 01:43:25,990
Very dangerous striker.

3617
01:43:25,991 --> 01:43:27,850
So Damien Maia has got
to close that distance.

3618
01:43:28,210 --> 01:43:31,900
I think Damien Maia at one
70 is a different beast.

3619
01:43:32,140 --> 01:43:33,790
He's so God damn big.

3620
01:43:34,120 --> 01:43:38,230
And his striking has got himself to
a point where he's not trying to be a

3621
01:43:38,231 --> 01:43:39,550
striker but he's good enough.

3622
01:43:39,551 --> 01:43:41,500
It's tracking that is distance is good.

3623
01:43:41,501 --> 01:43:42,334
See right there.

3624
01:43:42,370 --> 01:43:44,590
His comfort level and his
distance are very high.

3625
01:43:44,740 --> 01:43:47,500
So because of that and he's
not taking any big chances.

3626
01:43:47,501 --> 01:43:48,610
He's really just kinda like,

3627
01:43:48,640 --> 01:43:49,061
yeah,

3628
01:43:49,061 --> 01:43:49,900
that's what he's doing.

3629
01:43:49,901 --> 01:43:50,171
Right.

3630
01:43:50,171 --> 01:43:52,340
They're closing that
distance like a fucking

3631
01:43:52,340 --> 01:43:52,970
cat.

3632
01:43:52,970 --> 01:43:54,950
Look at that dragon conduct to the ground.

3633
01:43:54,980 --> 01:43:57,860
Let's see what he does here though and
he's been able to do this to everybody.

3634
01:43:57,861 --> 01:44:00,500
He fights Matt Brown who
is a beast on the ground.

3635
01:44:00,501 --> 01:44:01,334
He did it to him.

3636
01:44:01,490 --> 01:44:03,200
He crushed Neil Magni this way.

3637
01:44:03,350 --> 01:44:08,120
He's a totally different animal when it
comes to like his level of pressure and

3638
01:44:08,121 --> 01:44:08,954
Jujitsu.

3639
01:44:09,140 --> 01:44:14,140
He's on another planet mean and he is
really better at 38 then he's ever been

3640
01:44:15,561 --> 01:44:20,110
before including with is like submissions
in his transitions striking you said

3641
01:44:20,690 --> 01:44:22,790
like not just as distance but he could,

3642
01:44:22,791 --> 01:44:24,380
he could get in there and take some fire,

3643
01:44:24,381 --> 01:44:25,940
take some shots and it's no big deal.

3644
01:44:25,950 --> 01:44:27,560
That pass beautiful.

3645
01:44:27,710 --> 01:44:28,850
But he's not trying to,

3646
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:29,720
so far so good.

3647
01:44:29,721 --> 01:44:30,680
Now he's in top half.

3648
01:44:30,681 --> 01:44:31,420
He Palsy.

3649
01:44:31,420 --> 01:44:32,930
That's a 50 yard pass right there.

3650
01:44:33,230 --> 01:44:34,160
He got into top half.

3651
01:44:34,161 --> 01:44:35,090
He's not totally passed,

3652
01:44:35,091 --> 01:44:35,924
but this is,

3653
01:44:35,960 --> 01:44:38,900
look at this as three quarter mount.

3654
01:44:39,240 --> 01:44:39,470
He's,

3655
01:44:39,470 --> 01:44:40,040
he's,

3656
01:44:40,040 --> 01:44:40,761
he's in the third now.

3657
01:44:40,761 --> 01:44:45,140
He's got the whole perfect
position there to get the back.

3658
01:44:45,440 --> 01:44:45,681
God,

3659
01:44:45,681 --> 01:44:48,590
he's so good that the understanding
of top half right there,

3660
01:44:48,620 --> 01:44:52,190
that that position as opposed
to just regular half guard man.

3661
01:44:52,191 --> 01:44:55,280
When you really understand how
important mastering that position is,

3662
01:44:55,430 --> 01:44:57,020
that's why he's where he's at right now.

3663
01:44:57,140 --> 01:44:59,260
He had just just have
top how he's doing it.

3664
01:44:59,261 --> 01:45:00,230
He's going forward right here.

3665
01:45:00,700 --> 01:45:01,700
He's going for right here.

3666
01:45:01,701 --> 01:45:02,380
It's done.

3667
01:45:02,380 --> 01:45:03,130
He's got a condo.

3668
01:45:03,130 --> 01:45:03,740
It's done.

3669
01:45:03,740 --> 01:45:04,460
He's done.

3670
01:45:04,460 --> 01:45:05,900
He's going to choke them
out right over his face.

3671
01:45:05,901 --> 01:45:06,734
Man.

3672
01:45:07,100 --> 01:45:07,911
He's already asleep.

3673
01:45:07,911 --> 01:45:08,241
He's out.

3674
01:45:08,241 --> 01:45:08,571
He's out.

3675
01:45:08,571 --> 01:45:09,320
He's out.

3676
01:45:09,320 --> 01:45:10,153
He's out.

3677
01:45:11,420 --> 01:45:12,290
Wow.

3678
01:45:12,380 --> 01:45:13,213
Damn.

3679
01:45:13,590 --> 01:45:14,180
Wow.

3680
01:45:14,180 --> 01:45:16,040
Holy Shit.

3681
01:45:16,310 --> 01:45:17,900
Goddamn Carlos Condit.

3682
01:45:17,990 --> 01:45:19,220
Holy Shit.

3683
01:45:19,221 --> 01:45:23,600
He went right through them like Marcello
Garcia would have to Damien Maia is

3684
01:45:23,601 --> 01:45:24,830
something special.

3685
01:45:25,170 --> 01:45:26,140
He's special.

3686
01:45:27,770 --> 01:45:29,150
Holy Shit.

3687
01:45:29,151 --> 01:45:31,520
A Jujitsu is on a
completely different level.

3688
01:45:31,521 --> 01:45:33,260
That's some Hixon Gracie shit right there.

3689
01:45:33,860 --> 01:45:36,320
That's what we always
wanted to see from Hixson.

3690
01:45:36,770 --> 01:45:38,630
I think I've finally,

3691
01:45:38,631 --> 01:45:39,710
after all these years,

3692
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:42,260
he's so adjusted.

3693
01:45:42,530 --> 01:45:46,490
He made the transition
100% from the gay to MMA,

3694
01:45:46,491 --> 01:45:47,324
Jujitsu,

3695
01:45:47,490 --> 01:45:48,020
MMA.

3696
01:45:48,020 --> 01:45:49,310
He understands that.

3697
01:45:49,390 --> 01:45:51,680
The key was we took a bit by bit,

3698
01:45:52,010 --> 01:45:52,760
bit by bit.

3699
01:45:52,760 --> 01:45:54,530
He takes him down and he's in his guard.

3700
01:45:54,800 --> 01:45:56,150
He's in his guard right here.

3701
01:45:56,660 --> 01:45:58,400
You know he's in his
regular guard right here.

3702
01:45:58,401 --> 01:45:59,630
There's no top half yet,

3703
01:45:59,870 --> 01:46:02,150
but all he was fighting for here.

3704
01:46:02,240 --> 01:46:03,440
What's top half?

3705
01:46:03,860 --> 01:46:04,270
They aren't,

3706
01:46:04,270 --> 01:46:05,103
they're not showing it here.

3707
01:46:05,150 --> 01:46:07,550
All that in between shit
that made this possible.

3708
01:46:07,790 --> 01:46:10,040
So just listen to it,

3709
01:46:10,440 --> 01:46:12,180
keeps tightening it up and once he's,

3710
01:46:12,181 --> 01:46:14,570
he knows he's good at
school and he's developed,

3711
01:46:14,571 --> 01:46:18,470
he's developed that world class
Marcello squeeze right there.

3712
01:46:18,650 --> 01:46:20,390
That takes time to God.

3713
01:46:21,200 --> 01:46:23,360
But when I say barely
there while he's tapping,

3714
01:46:23,450 --> 01:46:28,450
but the way he got his back was all
based on his knowledge of that top half

3715
01:46:30,141 --> 01:46:31,070
position.

3716
01:46:31,250 --> 01:46:35,810
It was all based on that because he
didn't try to pass all at once he passed

3717
01:46:35,870 --> 01:46:36,820
halfway,

3718
01:46:36,860 --> 01:46:39,680
his leg was still stuck
and then he never passed.

3719
01:46:39,710 --> 01:46:40,543
Totally.

3720
01:46:40,820 --> 01:46:42,620
He never passed the fucking guard.

3721
01:46:43,310 --> 01:46:46,640
He went from top half and he realized
that if you've got a good top hat

3722
01:46:46,641 --> 01:46:47,210
position,

3723
01:46:47,210 --> 01:46:49,010
you could turn while you're facing the,

3724
01:46:49,290 --> 01:46:50,123
it can be.

3725
01:46:50,670 --> 01:46:52,170
It gives up his back.

3726
01:46:52,590 --> 01:46:52,831
Well,

3727
01:46:52,831 --> 01:46:53,191
he did,

3728
01:46:53,191 --> 01:46:53,610
right?

3729
01:46:53,610 --> 01:46:54,030
Well,

3730
01:46:54,030 --> 01:46:54,480
yes.

3731
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:55,470
Well exactly.

3732
01:46:55,560 --> 01:46:59,740
But he never passed his guard in the sense
where he was in regular half guard or

3733
01:46:59,741 --> 01:47:03,600
get the little shield and that he
fought for that inside position,

3734
01:47:03,601 --> 01:47:07,770
top half and then from top half as long
as that leg that's caught as long as the

3735
01:47:07,771 --> 01:47:08,521
knees free,

3736
01:47:08,521 --> 01:47:09,660
you don't even have to pass the guard.

3737
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:11,160
You dry the down.

3738
01:47:11,250 --> 01:47:15,720
Now you're in the three quarter amount
and once you're in three quarter mount in

3739
01:47:15,721 --> 01:47:16,710
MMA,

3740
01:47:17,160 --> 01:47:20,280
it wouldn't happen as easily in
in grappling without punches,

3741
01:47:20,281 --> 01:47:21,810
but when he's in three quarter amount,

3742
01:47:21,960 --> 01:47:23,520
as soon as you start punching,

3743
01:47:23,670 --> 01:47:25,110
he turns to his back.

3744
01:47:25,170 --> 01:47:26,370
You never pass the guard.

3745
01:47:26,460 --> 01:47:27,900
You never got inside control.

3746
01:47:28,020 --> 01:47:32,370
You went from top half to three
quarter mount to the back.

3747
01:47:32,430 --> 01:47:37,430
That's what the punches do so that
that pathway becomes so important.

3748
01:47:38,210 --> 01:47:39,043
MMA,

3749
01:47:39,240 --> 01:47:39,991
Jujitsu guys,

3750
01:47:39,991 --> 01:47:42,000
that is so huge to understand that.

3751
01:47:42,780 --> 01:47:44,730
Let me ask you this because
we've talked about this before.

3752
01:47:44,850 --> 01:47:49,200
If they did make the back of the head
legal like they used to in the old days,

3753
01:47:49,230 --> 01:47:51,000
like when Henzel Gracie fought that guy,

3754
01:47:51,001 --> 01:47:52,050
Ben strikers,

3755
01:47:52,290 --> 01:47:55,710
remember that you thought that judo guy
took his bass and just blast them with

3756
01:47:55,711 --> 01:47:56,670
elbows to the back of the head.

3757
01:47:56,671 --> 01:47:59,760
Early battle cage shows where
John Lewis would get a guy's back.

3758
01:47:59,910 --> 01:48:00,390
He would just,

3759
01:48:00,390 --> 01:48:02,940
he would just put his leg hooks and
the guy would be in like in a turtle

3760
01:48:02,941 --> 01:48:03,600
position.

3761
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:05,790
He did got his legs and rear naked choke.

3762
01:48:05,850 --> 01:48:10,850
I remember saying telling people before
they banned those strikes to the back of

3763
01:48:11,881 --> 01:48:12,714
the head.

3764
01:48:12,840 --> 01:48:16,830
I remember saying rear naked
choke are so not important.

3765
01:48:17,070 --> 01:48:17,731
All the,

3766
01:48:17,731 --> 01:48:19,620
what's important is
getting the back control,

3767
01:48:19,650 --> 01:48:23,010
putting your leg hooks and getting good
at writing and not get slipping up and

3768
01:48:23,011 --> 01:48:24,330
just throwing fucking elbows.

3769
01:48:24,420 --> 01:48:25,770
Rear naked choke is,

3770
01:48:25,980 --> 01:48:28,170
is like if you want to be nice to the guy,

3771
01:48:28,230 --> 01:48:29,160
you don't even need it.

3772
01:48:29,161 --> 01:48:30,330
It's totally optional.

3773
01:48:30,570 --> 01:48:35,570
The the game is getting a guy's back and
battering him with your elbows in the

3774
01:48:35,611 --> 01:48:36,360
back of the head.

3775
01:48:36,360 --> 01:48:38,310
That's how fights were ending instantly,

3776
01:48:38,670 --> 01:48:39,420
instantly.

3777
01:48:39,420 --> 01:48:42,570
If those back of the elbow
strikes were legal today,

3778
01:48:43,260 --> 01:48:43,590
man,

3779
01:48:43,590 --> 01:48:45,660
UFC so it'd be a lot shorter.

3780
01:48:45,690 --> 01:48:47,280
They would be bringing in them prelims,

3781
01:48:47,370 --> 01:48:49,410
they would have fucking 17 prelims,

3782
01:48:49,820 --> 01:48:50,521
you know what I'm saying?

3783
01:48:50,521 --> 01:48:55,170
Because if you factor in all the time
someone had someone's back and the fight

3784
01:48:55,171 --> 01:48:57,990
didn't end because they
weren't allowed to strike,

3785
01:48:59,220 --> 01:49:00,990
there'd be short ass fights everywhere.

3786
01:49:01,020 --> 01:49:05,790
It's true because like I guess like
medically it's really dangerous I guess.

3787
01:49:06,440 --> 01:49:07,830
Isn't that kick to the back of the head?

3788
01:49:07,831 --> 01:49:08,281
The same thing.

3789
01:49:08,281 --> 01:49:09,840
No one's jumping up and down to that,

3790
01:49:09,841 --> 01:49:14,100
but also like how much more dangerous
is it then getting your eye socket blown

3791
01:49:14,101 --> 01:49:14,370
in.

3792
01:49:14,370 --> 01:49:14,790
Exactly.

3793
01:49:14,790 --> 01:49:17,550
Saw in that Barboza fight or that um,

3794
01:49:17,650 --> 01:49:19,680
Pettis fight with Charles Olivera.

3795
01:49:20,310 --> 01:49:22,700
God Damn Damn Maya's,

3796
01:49:22,930 --> 01:49:23,910
but you know what I'm saying?

3797
01:49:24,230 --> 01:49:26,250
This is what we always wanted from Hixson.

3798
01:49:26,430 --> 01:49:27,180
Yeah.

3799
01:49:27,180 --> 01:49:31,860
We wanted a guy who could do like the
kind of Jujitsu that we knew existed out

3800
01:49:31,861 --> 01:49:32,670
there in the world.

3801
01:49:32,670 --> 01:49:34,080
We wanted to see it in MMA.

3802
01:49:34,260 --> 01:49:35,670
Whereas the MMA Jujitsu,

3803
01:49:35,671 --> 01:49:37,350
you'd see like great flashes.

3804
01:49:37,560 --> 01:49:40,500
Occasionally you get a guy
like a chocolate ray or
someone who is like real high

3805
01:49:40,501 --> 01:49:42,210
levels fighting in MMA.

3806
01:49:42,720 --> 01:49:47,720
But the highest level expression
of it is this guy right now in MMA.

3807
01:49:47,740 --> 01:49:47,980
I mean,

3808
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:50,140
who the fuck has got like tighter,

3809
01:49:50,141 --> 01:49:50,974
better,

3810
01:49:51,040 --> 01:49:52,510
more worldclass,

3811
01:49:52,630 --> 01:49:55,090
Jujitsu and MMA right
now than Damien Maia.

3812
01:49:55,091 --> 01:49:55,211
It's,

3813
01:49:55,211 --> 01:49:56,990
it's hard to argue her
rise right up though.

3814
01:49:57,010 --> 01:49:57,520
He's right up.

3815
01:49:57,520 --> 01:49:57,821
Shocker.

3816
01:49:57,821 --> 01:49:57,990
Right.

3817
01:49:57,990 --> 01:49:58,540
Could do that.

3818
01:49:58,540 --> 01:49:58,811
Yeah.

3819
01:49:58,811 --> 01:49:59,650
So could hodge her.

3820
01:49:59,710 --> 01:50:00,120
Yeah.

3821
01:50:00,120 --> 01:50:00,270
Right.

3822
01:50:00,270 --> 01:50:00,431
I mean,

3823
01:50:00,431 --> 01:50:01,061
isn't Jack Right?

3824
01:50:01,061 --> 01:50:01,631
One seven years.

3825
01:50:01,631 --> 01:50:02,350
The one 85.

3826
01:50:02,350 --> 01:50:03,340
He's one 85.

3827
01:50:03,430 --> 01:50:03,850
Okay,

3828
01:50:03,850 --> 01:50:05,050
so that's a different way class.

3829
01:50:05,100 --> 01:50:05,770
Yeah,

3830
01:50:05,770 --> 01:50:06,603
but you know,

3831
01:50:06,640 --> 01:50:08,500
that level is just so,

3832
01:50:08,530 --> 01:50:10,390
it's so intense and so extreme.

3833
01:50:10,530 --> 01:50:13,470
It was a lawsuit for Damon
MCAS in the beginning.

3834
01:50:13,710 --> 01:50:14,311
He,

3835
01:50:14,311 --> 01:50:14,580
uh,

3836
01:50:14,580 --> 01:50:16,830
he knew he came from a solid,

3837
01:50:16,831 --> 01:50:18,900
you get to background
was a world champion.

3838
01:50:18,901 --> 01:50:19,780
I think it was in Abu Dhabi.

3839
01:50:19,980 --> 01:50:21,390
He was a elite,

3840
01:50:21,730 --> 01:50:22,120
uh,

3841
01:50:22,120 --> 01:50:25,260
do Jitsu player who got
into MMA and right away,

3842
01:50:25,261 --> 01:50:27,540
like most Jujitsu guys and most wrestlers,

3843
01:50:27,541 --> 01:50:29,490
they get into MMA there thinking,

3844
01:50:29,491 --> 01:50:29,821
fuck,

3845
01:50:29,821 --> 01:50:32,970
the worst nightmare is getting
taken out in a stretcher.

3846
01:50:33,140 --> 01:50:33,390
Bye.

3847
01:50:33,390 --> 01:50:34,460
[inaudible] like a head kicked.

3848
01:50:34,461 --> 01:50:35,161
That's the worst slammer.

3849
01:50:35,161 --> 01:50:36,360
So let me take care of my striking.

3850
01:50:36,510 --> 01:50:37,620
They get involved in a striking,

3851
01:50:37,621 --> 01:50:38,454
and Damien Maia,

3852
01:50:38,520 --> 01:50:40,710
he got his foot to work
together fairly soon and he,

3853
01:50:40,920 --> 01:50:41,910
he was like up there with,

3854
01:50:41,911 --> 01:50:42,300
uh,

3855
01:50:42,300 --> 01:50:43,740
when he's fighting with Anderson Silva,

3856
01:50:43,741 --> 01:50:44,011
you know,

3857
01:50:44,011 --> 01:50:46,980
but he obviously wasn't
complete as a striker,

3858
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:48,960
but you can tell he made
a lot of improvements,

3859
01:50:48,961 --> 01:50:49,990
but he was still at,

3860
01:50:50,100 --> 01:50:51,480
not a lot of work to do.

3861
01:50:51,660 --> 01:50:52,980
Now what is it?

3862
01:50:53,070 --> 01:50:55,500
Seven years later he stuck with it.

3863
01:50:55,501 --> 01:50:56,334
He didn't quit.

3864
01:50:56,370 --> 01:50:57,203
He stuck with it.

3865
01:50:57,270 --> 01:50:58,200
A lot of guys,

3866
01:50:58,380 --> 01:50:58,711
you know,

3867
01:50:58,711 --> 01:50:59,011
and,

3868
01:50:59,011 --> 01:50:59,370
and,

3869
01:50:59,370 --> 01:51:01,020
and I'm not knocking them.

3870
01:51:01,021 --> 01:51:02,030
I understand a lot of guides.

3871
01:51:02,031 --> 01:51:02,761
How did you get to guys?

3872
01:51:02,761 --> 01:51:04,050
They peep into MMA.

3873
01:51:04,290 --> 01:51:05,610
They fuck with it for a year or two,

3874
01:51:05,611 --> 01:51:08,340
three and then like there's way too much.

3875
01:51:08,341 --> 01:51:11,580
I got to walk through too much
fire to get where Damien Maia is.

3876
01:51:11,700 --> 01:51:14,970
So it's a lot of top Jiu Jitsu
guys would dip in and they'll go,

3877
01:51:14,971 --> 01:51:15,690
you know what,

3878
01:51:15,690 --> 01:51:16,320
this is,

3879
01:51:16,320 --> 01:51:17,730
what do I need to do all this shit for?

3880
01:51:17,731 --> 01:51:19,200
I'm already known as a digital guy.

3881
01:51:19,380 --> 01:51:20,640
I'm just going to teach Jujitsu.

3882
01:51:20,790 --> 01:51:25,790
Fuck this MMA shit with Damien Maia did
is what only a handful of these world

3883
01:51:26,740 --> 01:51:28,110
class you get to play as you're doing.

3884
01:51:28,290 --> 01:51:31,530
They're gonna fucking walking through
the fire that keep going and keep going.

3885
01:51:31,530 --> 01:51:35,390
They just fucking don't quit and
eventually they become legit strikers.

3886
01:51:35,400 --> 01:51:38,820
Like they got eight years of striking
10 years of striking under their belt.

3887
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:42,480
You're a legit striker now you're
not just a BJJ world champion.

3888
01:51:42,630 --> 01:51:44,940
Very few stick it out,

3889
01:51:45,120 --> 01:51:45,511
Damian,

3890
01:51:45,511 --> 01:51:47,220
my stuck it out and now man,

3891
01:51:47,221 --> 01:51:48,440
he's got to the point now it's all,

3892
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:50,220
it's almost like based on his model,

3893
01:51:50,400 --> 01:51:53,520
it's almost like you take a worldclass
Jujitsu player and you're taking me wants

3894
01:51:53,521 --> 01:51:53,701
to do,

3895
01:51:53,701 --> 01:51:54,600
I'm a mania asks you,

3896
01:51:54,750 --> 01:51:55,890
what do you think you'd say,

3897
01:51:55,891 --> 01:51:56,131
dude,

3898
01:51:56,131 --> 01:51:58,920
if you could hang in there
for eight solid years,

3899
01:51:58,921 --> 01:52:00,300
no matter how many times you lose,

3900
01:52:00,420 --> 01:52:01,800
you just keep going forward.

3901
01:52:01,920 --> 01:52:02,190
No,

3902
01:52:02,190 --> 01:52:03,760
that you're going to get
shut off a couple of times.

3903
01:52:03,770 --> 01:52:06,690
Try to eliminate that as much
as possible and just keep going.

3904
01:52:06,691 --> 01:52:07,620
No matter what happens.

3905
01:52:07,740 --> 01:52:11,370
Just get to the eight year mark and as
long as you spent those last eight years,

3906
01:52:11,800 --> 01:52:13,650
B always remaining a student.

3907
01:52:13,650 --> 01:52:14,520
Always learning,

3908
01:52:14,610 --> 01:52:18,300
training your motherfucking ass off
in all aspects of the fighting game.

3909
01:52:18,360 --> 01:52:20,070
Remaining open minded.

3910
01:52:20,190 --> 01:52:23,100
I constantly adding weapons
right down to the weapon.

3911
01:52:23,200 --> 01:52:23,790
If you as long,

3912
01:52:23,790 --> 01:52:24,541
no matter what happens,

3913
01:52:24,541 --> 01:52:25,170
win or lose,

3914
01:52:25,170 --> 01:52:26,820
as long as you're in the mix at the round,

3915
01:52:26,821 --> 01:52:27,330
the eight,

3916
01:52:27,330 --> 01:52:27,751
nine,

3917
01:52:27,751 --> 01:52:28,590
10 year mark,

3918
01:52:28,830 --> 01:52:30,390
you're going to be fucking Damian.

3919
01:52:30,420 --> 01:52:32,430
You're going to be in that
Damien Maia realm right there.

3920
01:52:32,730 --> 01:52:33,660
He figured it out.

3921
01:52:33,690 --> 01:52:36,640
He kept going and now we're talking
about Damon minds like that.

3922
01:52:36,660 --> 01:52:38,400
One of the scariest guys out there.

3923
01:52:38,520 --> 01:52:41,190
We weren't doing that as
much four or five years ago.

3924
01:52:41,340 --> 01:52:42,210
He stuck it out.

3925
01:52:42,330 --> 01:52:43,920
He wasn't worried about
the wins and losses.

3926
01:52:43,980 --> 01:52:45,380
He just kept his down,

3927
01:52:45,381 --> 01:52:47,390
kept grinding bull and look what happened.

3928
01:52:47,780 --> 01:52:48,710
He also completed

3929
01:52:48,710 --> 01:52:48,781
well,

3930
01:52:48,781 --> 01:52:51,740
he devoted himself to fighting Jujitsu.

3931
01:52:51,770 --> 01:52:53,630
Like you didn't try to
be a kickboxer anymore,

3932
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:54,970
just trying to enforce it.

3933
01:52:54,980 --> 01:52:55,900
Jujitsu on guys.

3934
01:52:56,010 --> 01:52:56,380
He,

3935
01:52:56,380 --> 01:53:00,560
he did have that phase where
he was trying to but a,

3936
01:53:00,690 --> 01:53:02,700
but if you look at it as a learning,

3937
01:53:02,880 --> 01:53:05,190
that was a perfect thing for
him to do and they're like,

3938
01:53:05,191 --> 01:53:09,150
maybe like maybe in 200 years we're
going to look back and based on all these

3939
01:53:09,151 --> 01:53:09,990
guys like Damien Meyer,

3940
01:53:09,991 --> 01:53:10,620
we're going to go,

3941
01:53:10,620 --> 01:53:11,190
okay,

3942
01:53:11,190 --> 01:53:15,810
we need three or four fights where
you just stand no matter what.

3943
01:53:15,840 --> 01:53:16,620
You're just standing.

3944
01:53:16,620 --> 01:53:19,560
You have to know that you could
stand in there if you had to.

3945
01:53:19,561 --> 01:53:20,570
We we got to go to,

3946
01:53:20,640 --> 01:53:23,250
you can't be trying to take a
guy down every God damn fight.

3947
01:53:23,430 --> 01:53:25,560
You got to walk through
the fire winner lose.

3948
01:53:25,561 --> 01:53:26,394
You're going to get caught.

3949
01:53:26,550 --> 01:53:27,630
Hopefully you don't get caught.

3950
01:53:27,631 --> 01:53:30,030
Hopefully you'd end up being
one of those guys that crushes.

3951
01:53:30,031 --> 01:53:30,481
People were like,

3952
01:53:30,481 --> 01:53:30,991
oh shit,

3953
01:53:30,991 --> 01:53:31,824
stay stand.

3954
01:53:31,860 --> 01:53:33,030
But you got to walk through that.

3955
01:53:33,031 --> 01:53:33,960
There's an win or lose.

3956
01:53:33,961 --> 01:53:35,070
You got to walk through that.

3957
01:53:35,190 --> 01:53:36,510
You got to stand with everybody.

3958
01:53:36,511 --> 01:53:38,010
You can't be afraid and you got to have,

3959
01:53:38,070 --> 01:53:40,110
I think that's what Georgia
Gel was going to cause.

3960
01:53:40,400 --> 01:53:42,480
Georgia's hell was one of those
guys who's a Jujitsu black belt.

3961
01:53:42,600 --> 01:53:45,990
He comes in and he fucking doesn't want
to go to the ground and he's out there

3962
01:53:45,991 --> 01:53:49,290
in the cage fucking thrown
down in these epic wars.

3963
01:53:49,410 --> 01:53:50,151
He wants some,

3964
01:53:50,151 --> 01:53:50,731
he lost some.

3965
01:53:50,731 --> 01:53:51,564
But you know what?

3966
01:53:51,840 --> 01:53:54,390
One thing about Georgia Shell is he,

3967
01:53:54,990 --> 01:53:57,750
he's just a fucking furious.

3968
01:53:57,751 --> 01:53:58,261
He was just,

3969
01:53:58,261 --> 01:53:59,160
he didn't give a shit.

3970
01:53:59,220 --> 01:54:02,430
He had a black belt in Jujitsu and
was willing to stand with anybody.

3971
01:54:02,490 --> 01:54:04,470
Some people think that
wasn't the best decision.

3972
01:54:04,590 --> 01:54:05,040
So,

3973
01:54:05,040 --> 01:54:06,780
but he had good kickboxing too though,

3974
01:54:06,810 --> 01:54:10,950
regardless wasn't standing because he
wasn't good at Georgia jail is one of

3975
01:54:10,951 --> 01:54:11,311
those guys,

3976
01:54:11,311 --> 01:54:13,500
I think if he would've just
kept going at this point,

3977
01:54:13,501 --> 01:54:15,150
you imagine if he
would've just kept going,

3978
01:54:15,270 --> 01:54:15,771
Georgia's,

3979
01:54:15,771 --> 01:54:15,900
oh,

3980
01:54:15,900 --> 01:54:17,250
could have been like a Damien Maia.

3981
01:54:17,370 --> 01:54:18,750
He could've been just like that.

3982
01:54:18,990 --> 01:54:22,800
But you got to have a man the,

3983
01:54:23,570 --> 01:54:25,080
you've got to have the
vision to see that shit.

3984
01:54:25,081 --> 01:54:25,914
Cause a lot of guys,

3985
01:54:26,100 --> 01:54:27,540
it's way too much goddamn work.

3986
01:54:27,541 --> 01:54:28,560
Brain damage.

3987
01:54:28,561 --> 01:54:30,340
And I got to kick box fuck kit,

3988
01:54:30,360 --> 01:54:31,193
but I want to get knocked.

3989
01:54:31,260 --> 01:54:32,093
I got shot.

3990
01:54:32,130 --> 01:54:36,240
Maybe there's been Brazilian Jiu Jitsu
world champions that have tried to do MMA

3991
01:54:36,390 --> 01:54:40,380
and do the first five fights or like
three shut offs and they're just getting

3992
01:54:40,381 --> 01:54:40,861
crushed.

3993
01:54:40,861 --> 01:54:41,940
I don't want to name any names.

3994
01:54:42,180 --> 01:54:43,440
That's a good reason to just say,

3995
01:54:43,441 --> 01:54:44,070
you know what,

3996
01:54:44,070 --> 01:54:45,540
let me stick with Jujitsu.

3997
01:54:45,570 --> 01:54:46,081
You know what I mean?

3998
01:54:46,081 --> 01:54:47,340
There's some all time greats.

3999
01:54:47,370 --> 01:54:47,850
Yeah.

4000
01:54:47,850 --> 01:54:48,171
You,

4001
01:54:48,171 --> 01:54:48,421
you know,

4002
01:54:48,421 --> 01:54:52,770
the small time grades who got into Jew
from Jujitsu and got an MMA only had one

4003
01:54:52,771 --> 01:54:53,381
or two fights.

4004
01:54:53,381 --> 01:54:53,780
So it was like,

4005
01:54:53,780 --> 01:54:54,200
we were like,

4006
01:54:54,200 --> 01:54:55,060
fuck yeah.

4007
01:54:55,240 --> 01:54:55,550
And,

4008
01:54:55,550 --> 01:54:56,281
and you know what?

4009
01:54:56,281 --> 01:54:57,114
I don't blame them.

4010
01:54:57,800 --> 01:54:58,031
I mean,

4011
01:54:58,031 --> 01:54:59,090
there's really good look at me.

4012
01:54:59,160 --> 01:55:00,120
I never fucking did.

4013
01:55:00,121 --> 01:55:00,600
MMM.

4014
01:55:00,600 --> 01:55:00,990
I,

4015
01:55:00,990 --> 01:55:01,591
I was like,

4016
01:55:01,591 --> 01:55:02,470
what we were talking about

4017
01:55:02,570 --> 01:55:03,403
came to,

4018
01:55:03,520 --> 01:55:05,430
we were talking about women's volleyball.

4019
01:55:05,480 --> 01:55:08,130
Like it's weird what
sports become a hexagon.

4020
01:55:08,670 --> 01:55:10,350
It's weird what sports become,

4021
01:55:10,530 --> 01:55:10,621
uh,

4022
01:55:10,621 --> 01:55:14,280
like a sport where you can make
money and which ones don't,

4023
01:55:15,030 --> 01:55:15,480
you know,

4024
01:55:15,480 --> 01:55:20,480
like it would be wonderful if just
submission grappling by itself,

4025
01:55:21,360 --> 01:55:21,811
you know,

4026
01:55:21,811 --> 01:55:26,811
became a sport where there was a real
obvious transition between like amateur

4027
01:55:28,561 --> 01:55:30,930
level to like be in a professional,

4028
01:55:31,470 --> 01:55:31,910
you know?

4029
01:55:31,910 --> 01:55:31,991
Well,

4030
01:55:31,991 --> 01:55:32,211
again,

4031
01:55:32,211 --> 01:55:35,060
I may like getting a demo or Matt
or it had been even wrestling.

4032
01:55:35,061 --> 01:55:35,630
Wrestling.

4033
01:55:35,630 --> 01:55:38,860
How is it that golf is
like this super gigantic,

4034
01:55:38,861 --> 01:55:38,961
oh,

4035
01:55:38,961 --> 01:55:39,621
sports.

4036
01:55:39,621 --> 01:55:40,310
The media.

4037
01:55:40,310 --> 01:55:41,570
I understand people enjoy it.

4038
01:55:41,840 --> 01:55:42,430
Don't get me wrong.

4039
01:55:42,430 --> 01:55:43,263
Who controls,

4040
01:55:43,770 --> 01:55:44,100
I'm not

4041
01:55:44,100 --> 01:55:44,340
kidding.

4042
01:55:44,340 --> 01:55:46,320
I'm not a distinct golf.

4043
01:55:46,321 --> 01:55:47,430
I know people love that shit,

4044
01:55:47,820 --> 01:55:52,820
but how is that a professional sport
but not wrestling like actual wrestling?

4045
01:55:53,970 --> 01:55:56,730
Like can you watch like how
difficult it is for actual wrestling?

4046
01:55:56,880 --> 01:55:57,330
Didn't,

4047
01:55:57,330 --> 01:55:57,780
sorry,

4048
01:55:57,780 --> 01:55:58,980
it didn't make it didn't make it.

4049
01:55:59,340 --> 01:56:00,270
What about basketball?

4050
01:56:00,330 --> 01:56:01,163
Basketball made it.

4051
01:56:01,590 --> 01:56:04,680
Basketball guys have
mansions and they live in,

4052
01:56:04,681 --> 01:56:05,880
but we're both in the Olympics.

4053
01:56:05,920 --> 01:56:06,630
Yeah.

4054
01:56:06,630 --> 01:56:07,170
But um,

4055
01:56:07,170 --> 01:56:08,190
nobody wants to see you.

4056
01:56:08,310 --> 01:56:09,900
You're only here because
we're nice to you.

4057
01:56:09,920 --> 01:56:11,190
I bet if someone got behind Z,

4058
01:56:11,200 --> 01:56:11,610
right.

4059
01:56:11,610 --> 01:56:13,680
I bet if someone got
behind female wrestling,

4060
01:56:13,770 --> 01:56:14,603
I bet.

4061
01:56:15,080 --> 01:56:15,390
Well,

4062
01:56:15,390 --> 01:56:16,350
they tried it for a while.

4063
01:56:16,351 --> 01:56:19,680
They had an actual wrestling
event with wrestling rules.

4064
01:56:19,681 --> 01:56:20,514
You remember that?

4065
01:56:20,730 --> 01:56:22,080
It was a professional,

4066
01:56:22,081 --> 01:56:24,660
I think they called it real pro
wrestling or something like that,

4067
01:56:24,780 --> 01:56:26,130
but it was actual,

4068
01:56:26,200 --> 01:56:26,880
goddammit,

4069
01:56:26,880 --> 01:56:28,140
see if you can find out.

4070
01:56:28,170 --> 01:56:29,700
It was fairly recently,

4071
01:56:29,701 --> 01:56:31,070
like within the last decade or so.

4072
01:56:31,070 --> 01:56:31,950
That's the problem with,

4073
01:56:32,010 --> 01:56:32,821
with wrestling.

4074
01:56:32,821 --> 01:56:37,821
I see crossing over to the mainstream is
the glaring problems in wrestling when

4075
01:56:39,670 --> 01:56:41,580
transitioning and the May in wrestling,

4076
01:56:41,581 --> 01:56:43,800
it's totally okay to give your back.

4077
01:56:43,830 --> 01:56:48,830
It's like you give your back to
win fights and to prevent losses.

4078
01:56:49,020 --> 01:56:52,760
You give your backs up when you see that
and you see two guys wrestling and the

4079
01:56:52,761 --> 01:56:56,430
guys flat on his back or flat on his
face and then the guy's on his back.

4080
01:56:57,090 --> 01:56:57,661
We know too,

4081
01:56:57,661 --> 01:56:59,310
we've seen too many UFC is too.

4082
01:56:59,340 --> 01:57:01,110
We just know that is not right.

4083
01:57:01,230 --> 01:57:02,880
But I think if they made,

4084
01:57:03,180 --> 01:57:03,900
uh,

4085
01:57:03,900 --> 01:57:04,440
uh,

4086
01:57:04,440 --> 01:57:06,600
like a hybrid of wrestling and judo,

4087
01:57:06,630 --> 01:57:08,430
you could call it Gnocchi Judah because,

4088
01:57:08,680 --> 01:57:09,060
um,

4089
01:57:09,060 --> 01:57:13,170
although wrestling is closer
to MMA because it's no gay,

4090
01:57:13,260 --> 01:57:13,771
you know,

4091
01:57:13,771 --> 01:57:16,070
and there's no grabbing
clothes and shit that's closer,

4092
01:57:16,080 --> 01:57:17,850
but you aren't given the back.

4093
01:57:17,851 --> 01:57:19,950
So that's fucked up in judo.

4094
01:57:20,580 --> 01:57:21,031
Yes.

4095
01:57:21,031 --> 01:57:25,950
It's further away from Mna in the sense
that there's a g and a plan tug of war

4096
01:57:25,951 --> 01:57:27,540
with the callers and the
sleeves and all that.

4097
01:57:27,570 --> 01:57:30,660
But when they get a takedown in judo,

4098
01:57:30,780 --> 01:57:33,570
they're allowed like 30 seconds on
the ground to go for submissions.

4099
01:57:33,690 --> 01:57:35,880
So some guys get really good at arm bars.

4100
01:57:35,881 --> 01:57:36,714
You don't have to,

4101
01:57:36,720 --> 01:57:37,620
it's like extra.

4102
01:57:37,770 --> 01:57:40,470
If you do judo and you
never work on arm bars,

4103
01:57:40,471 --> 01:57:41,041
you're fine.

4104
01:57:41,041 --> 01:57:42,720
The most important thing
is that front line.

4105
01:57:42,721 --> 01:57:44,640
What's going to happen in that front line?

4106
01:57:44,940 --> 01:57:47,640
The in judo submissions are like gravy.

4107
01:57:47,641 --> 01:57:50,180
You could be good at some guys
or get really good at Amr,

4108
01:57:50,220 --> 01:57:53,850
like Shinya Aoki for instance in judo
and when he wrestled a nationally in

4109
01:57:53,851 --> 01:57:54,420
Japan,

4110
01:57:54,420 --> 01:57:56,250
he was known as not as the takedown guy.

4111
01:57:56,251 --> 01:57:58,260
All of those take downs are really good
obviously because he's a black belt in

4112
01:57:58,261 --> 01:57:58,441
judo,

4113
01:57:58,441 --> 01:58:01,020
but he was known for
flying armbars in judo.

4114
01:58:01,140 --> 01:58:02,550
Totally unnecessary.

4115
01:58:02,551 --> 01:58:03,990
That's the rule in judo.

4116
01:58:03,991 --> 01:58:05,220
Like how,

4117
01:58:05,250 --> 01:58:08,970
how quickly do you have to go to a
submission once you're scrambling on the

4118
01:58:08,971 --> 01:58:09,271
ground?

4119
01:58:09,271 --> 01:58:11,790
I don't know it
specifically or technically,

4120
01:58:11,791 --> 01:58:15,110
all I know is they give you
time for submissions than
they allow submissions and

4121
01:58:15,111 --> 01:58:16,140
in wrestling they don't.

4122
01:58:16,260 --> 01:58:21,260
But if you combined for the sake of MMA
for the sake of creating the ultimate

4123
01:58:21,970 --> 01:58:25,440
takedown system geared
directly for him and me,

4124
01:58:25,441 --> 01:58:28,020
I think you would have to go
with a no guid judo style.

4125
01:58:28,021 --> 01:58:29,330
Like it's part wrestling part Judah.

4126
01:58:29,331 --> 01:58:32,130
Like you take the rules with oil,

4127
01:58:32,390 --> 01:58:37,140
those pants yet and we got the sport and
you allow grabbing of the shaft because

4128
01:58:37,141 --> 01:58:38,250
that's more realistic.

4129
01:58:39,120 --> 01:58:40,380
You know what in the fuck is this Jamie?

4130
01:58:40,381 --> 01:58:41,214
What are you showing us?

4131
01:58:42,460 --> 01:58:43,890
What are you showing us
sites are over on Fox.

4132
01:58:43,891 --> 01:58:44,850
They price which over overdose

4133
01:58:47,380 --> 01:58:48,100
animal video.

4134
01:58:48,100 --> 01:58:48,933
Just put up,

4135
01:58:49,270 --> 01:58:49,900
what is this like?

4136
01:58:49,900 --> 01:58:52,770
Oh it's a ferret or something
running around this lawn.

4137
01:58:52,810 --> 01:58:54,310
It picked up an egg,

4138
01:58:54,950 --> 01:58:55,360
right?

4139
01:58:55,360 --> 01:58:56,080
Take a quick best.

4140
01:58:56,080 --> 01:58:56,291
Yeah,

4141
01:58:56,291 --> 01:58:57,010
go ahead.

4142
01:58:57,010 --> 01:58:57,371
I was like,

4143
01:58:57,371 --> 01:58:58,240
what is Jamie showing me?

4144
01:58:58,241 --> 01:58:59,560
Is this like breaking news?

4145
01:58:59,800 --> 01:59:04,030
There's a date that gets
Zika virus written ferret.

4146
01:59:04,120 --> 01:59:05,860
I was thinking when you're talking
about the high paid athletes,

4147
01:59:05,890 --> 01:59:06,281
they weren't,

4148
01:59:06,281 --> 01:59:08,230
oh had they haven't always
been high paid though.

4149
01:59:08,260 --> 01:59:09,093
It wasn't like,

4150
01:59:09,220 --> 01:59:09,970
it's a good question.

4151
01:59:09,970 --> 01:59:10,840
I mean it's a good point there.

4152
01:59:10,841 --> 01:59:13,360
Last 30 years there's
been big revenue sharing.

4153
01:59:13,570 --> 01:59:15,520
I don't know when sports
became huge though.

4154
01:59:15,521 --> 01:59:18,080
I know the Yankees were
huge back in the day.

4155
01:59:18,400 --> 01:59:20,200
You know the the old time days,

4156
01:59:20,201 --> 01:59:22,390
TV money I think is where
a lot of it came from.

4157
01:59:22,420 --> 01:59:22,720
Right.

4158
01:59:22,720 --> 01:59:23,510
When did,

4159
01:59:23,510 --> 01:59:27,040
when did football become like the biggest
thing in the world was in the fifties

4160
01:59:27,040 --> 01:59:27,660
that's when it really hurts.

4161
01:59:27,660 --> 01:59:31,570
Bloom started in the 50s he's
not amazing like 50 years ago.

4162
01:59:31,780 --> 01:59:35,830
That's amazing that the
super bowl is only that.

4163
01:59:35,860 --> 01:59:37,890
I mean we would just say 50 years I think.

4164
01:59:37,940 --> 01:59:39,910
Think 51 or 50 that's incredible.

4165
01:59:40,420 --> 01:59:41,380
55 they're not,

4166
01:59:41,620 --> 01:59:42,640
they're not that deep into it.

4167
01:59:43,330 --> 01:59:46,870
That's really incredible when you think
about it cause it seems like inexorable,

4168
01:59:46,871 --> 01:59:49,000
it seemed like he couldn't
pull it out of America.

4169
01:59:49,760 --> 01:59:51,790
Like if you tried to pull
football out of America,

4170
01:59:51,820 --> 01:59:55,570
people were like you are in even
Mercan it's only been around for like a

4171
01:59:55,571 --> 01:59:57,430
fraction of American baseball is dying,

4172
01:59:57,431 --> 01:59:59,770
but it's making just as
much money as it ever has.

4173
02:00:00,190 --> 02:00:04,930
But the problem would flip ball is
now we know if Fox your head up,

4174
02:00:05,470 --> 02:00:10,470
and I'm sure the case is
the same or similar with MMA
and I'm sure it's the same

4175
02:00:12,401 --> 02:00:17,401
or similar with a lot of different
high impact combat sports,

4176
02:00:17,891 --> 02:00:18,461
boxing,

4177
02:00:18,461 --> 02:00:19,330
kickboxing.

4178
02:00:19,990 --> 02:00:21,580
I'm not saying you
shouldn't be able to do it,

4179
02:00:21,880 --> 02:00:23,050
but the,

4180
02:00:23,250 --> 02:00:25,420
the fact that that's our number one sport.

4181
02:00:25,480 --> 02:00:26,111
It's a sport.

4182
02:00:26,111 --> 02:00:29,080
We know you're getting
lit up all the time.

4183
02:00:29,620 --> 02:00:31,750
Bong dudes or crash into each other.

4184
02:00:31,751 --> 02:00:32,680
Bong.

4185
02:00:33,280 --> 02:00:34,660
Last time we talked about this,

4186
02:00:34,661 --> 02:00:37,630
some people will send us some videos
of like people playing football.

4187
02:00:37,960 --> 02:00:38,510
Hi.

4188
02:00:38,510 --> 02:00:40,540
Looked like high level
football without pads.

4189
02:00:40,610 --> 02:00:41,443
Yeah.

4190
02:00:41,760 --> 02:00:42,530
Cuts going on now,

4191
02:00:42,530 --> 02:00:43,363
right?

4192
02:00:43,530 --> 02:00:43,720
Yeah.

4193
02:00:43,720 --> 02:00:44,553
You can drink,

4194
02:00:44,930 --> 02:00:45,900
you will allow him to dress.

4195
02:00:45,940 --> 02:00:46,773
He could drink.

4196
02:00:47,140 --> 02:00:47,920
Um,

4197
02:00:47,920 --> 02:00:48,701
so yeah,

4198
02:00:48,701 --> 02:00:49,511
that's interesting man.

4199
02:00:49,511 --> 02:00:52,030
Because I wonder like at
what point in time they say,

4200
02:00:52,031 --> 02:00:52,690
look,

4201
02:00:52,690 --> 02:00:53,200
it is,

4202
02:00:53,200 --> 02:00:53,590
you know,

4203
02:00:53,590 --> 02:00:55,030
it is just a fact of the game.

4204
02:00:55,210 --> 02:00:56,080
People are going to get hurt.

4205
02:00:56,680 --> 02:00:58,010
Let's just accept the fact.

4206
02:00:58,011 --> 02:00:58,200
Thank you.

4207
02:00:58,200 --> 02:00:58,470
Sure.

4208
02:00:58,470 --> 02:00:59,140
Don't want to watch it.

4209
02:00:59,140 --> 02:00:59,380
Yeah.

4210
02:00:59,380 --> 02:01:01,710
Let's just accept the fact and uh,

4211
02:01:01,780 --> 02:01:04,240
these gentlemen should get paid
a significant amount of money.

4212
02:01:04,360 --> 02:01:05,193
You know?

4213
02:01:07,120 --> 02:01:07,391
I mean,

4214
02:01:07,391 --> 02:01:07,991
I guess,

4215
02:01:07,991 --> 02:01:09,350
I mean it's just the
revenue sharing theirs.

4216
02:01:09,670 --> 02:01:10,870
I just look something up real quick.

4217
02:01:10,871 --> 02:01:11,650
Just really quick.

4218
02:01:11,650 --> 02:01:12,483
Baseball,

4219
02:01:12,570 --> 02:01:17,570
MLB and NFL both are getting over over
$3 billion a year that they're sharing

4220
02:01:17,741 --> 02:01:18,640
with their players.

4221
02:01:19,840 --> 02:01:21,310
Who knows how much it is in fighting,

4222
02:01:21,311 --> 02:01:21,910
but,

4223
02:01:21,910 --> 02:01:22,743
well,

4224
02:01:23,030 --> 02:01:24,820
baseball's totally different,

4225
02:01:24,821 --> 02:01:25,210
right?

4226
02:01:25,210 --> 02:01:26,080
Because baseball,

4227
02:01:26,081 --> 02:01:26,950
you're not getting hurt.

4228
02:01:27,250 --> 02:01:29,020
Like the football thing is a total,

4229
02:01:29,021 --> 02:01:30,940
I mean you obviously have
the potential to get hurt.

4230
02:01:30,941 --> 02:01:32,320
You definitely get hit by a pitch.

4231
02:01:32,710 --> 02:01:33,491
When I was a kid,

4232
02:01:33,491 --> 02:01:33,821
man,

4233
02:01:33,821 --> 02:01:34,331
that was that.

4234
02:01:34,331 --> 02:01:34,750
Uh,

4235
02:01:34,750 --> 02:01:35,261
what's his name?

4236
02:01:35,261 --> 02:01:35,621
Tony.

4237
02:01:35,621 --> 02:01:37,360
See that guy that died,

4238
02:01:37,540 --> 02:01:38,530
he got hit by a pitch,

4239
02:01:38,531 --> 02:01:39,590
I believe was a,

4240
02:01:39,591 --> 02:01:44,591
I'm a Boston red sox player and he got
hit with a pitch and got really badly,

4241
02:01:46,011 --> 02:01:47,570
badly hurt by the pitch.

4242
02:01:47,900 --> 02:01:49,520
Tony Conigliaro.

4243
02:01:49,790 --> 02:01:52,840
Is that it clinically Ari or oh or,

4244
02:01:53,300 --> 02:01:54,140
oh yeah.

4245
02:01:54,770 --> 02:01:56,660
That was a big thing when I was a kid.

4246
02:01:56,960 --> 02:01:57,890
Like I remember thinking,

4247
02:01:57,891 --> 02:01:58,221
Whoa,

4248
02:01:58,221 --> 02:01:58,850
you could,

4249
02:01:58,850 --> 02:02:02,150
you can get that fucked up by a pitch
that you're never the same again,

4250
02:02:04,130 --> 02:02:05,450
guys getting hit by fast balls.

4251
02:02:05,451 --> 02:02:06,170
It was no joke.

4252
02:02:06,170 --> 02:02:10,200
And you have to think what kind of
helmets did they have at the beginning and

4253
02:02:10,210 --> 02:02:11,360
they have no helmets at all.

4254
02:02:12,050 --> 02:02:12,883
You know,

4255
02:02:13,820 --> 02:02:15,320
what kind of helmets did
they have in baseball?

4256
02:02:16,890 --> 02:02:18,120
Like a regular,

4257
02:02:18,121 --> 02:02:18,954
uh,

4258
02:02:19,170 --> 02:02:20,940
like they're almost like
football helmets now.

4259
02:02:20,941 --> 02:02:21,570
They do.

4260
02:02:21,570 --> 02:02:22,650
But when did they come up with those?

4261
02:02:22,920 --> 02:02:27,210
Not until they made little league
baseball players wear them all the time.

4262
02:02:27,211 --> 02:02:28,044
But uh,

4263
02:02:28,190 --> 02:02:28,550
I don't,

4264
02:02:28,550 --> 02:02:31,110
I guess they always made
professionals wear helmets.

4265
02:02:31,170 --> 02:02:31,770
I got a pizza.

4266
02:02:31,770 --> 02:02:32,630
You guys talked this up?

4267
02:02:32,730 --> 02:02:32,911
No,

4268
02:02:32,911 --> 02:02:34,110
because then like hockey,

4269
02:02:34,140 --> 02:02:35,270
there's not,

4270
02:02:35,610 --> 02:02:36,340
there was a,

4271
02:02:36,340 --> 02:02:39,210
when I was younger there were players
that didn't have to wear helmets and

4272
02:02:39,211 --> 02:02:41,580
there's even guys who wear a face mask.

4273
02:02:41,610 --> 02:02:44,880
I remember that in hockey you had wearing
a helmet mount and you are a pussy or

4274
02:02:44,881 --> 02:02:45,241
something.

4275
02:02:45,241 --> 02:02:45,451
Right.

4276
02:02:45,451 --> 02:02:46,260
In hockey.

4277
02:02:46,260 --> 02:02:47,610
But then little by little,

4278
02:02:47,670 --> 02:02:48,990
the grandfathered in thing like,

4279
02:02:48,991 --> 02:02:49,350
God,

4280
02:02:49,350 --> 02:02:50,790
there's got to be a movie about that guy.

4281
02:02:50,791 --> 02:02:54,450
The first guy that wore the helmet
and all the persecution he got,

4282
02:02:56,400 --> 02:02:57,480
he must've fucking,

4283
02:02:57,720 --> 02:02:59,130
he must've had a good excuse.

4284
02:02:59,400 --> 02:03:01,350
He probably had some kind
of head trauma were like,

4285
02:03:01,351 --> 02:03:01,531
dude,

4286
02:03:01,531 --> 02:03:02,430
I gotta wear a helmet.

4287
02:03:02,431 --> 02:03:06,330
One more hit and I'm a
vegetable or I'm from in Ohio.

4288
02:03:06,331 --> 02:03:10,660
I think it was the first place in a
NHL game that someone died in the crowd

4289
02:03:10,661 --> 02:03:12,420
because the puck came
flying into the crowd.

4290
02:03:12,780 --> 02:03:13,620
A little girl died.

4291
02:03:14,250 --> 02:03:15,330
She got hit by a puck.

4292
02:03:15,780 --> 02:03:16,510
Oh my God,

4293
02:03:16,510 --> 02:03:19,080
that's up all around the
outside so it doesn't,

4294
02:03:19,140 --> 02:03:20,220
it doesn't happen anymore.

4295
02:03:20,480 --> 02:03:22,110
But did it happen every now and then?

4296
02:03:22,530 --> 02:03:24,360
Catching a puck at a
game used to be a thing.

4297
02:03:24,361 --> 02:03:29,361
So we're like a foul ball flying in and
keep your eyes open because you fucked

4298
02:03:29,491 --> 02:03:30,360
up from foul balls.

4299
02:03:30,361 --> 02:03:32,640
I always wondered that like
line drives and showed people,

4300
02:03:32,641 --> 02:03:36,900
I've seen him come flying at people
had serious like head trauma.

4301
02:03:37,440 --> 02:03:39,360
Broken bats have come
flying into the crowd too.

4302
02:03:39,650 --> 02:03:41,110
Shit flying.

4303
02:03:42,120 --> 02:03:44,350
Anybody get stabbed in
the eye with the bat?

4304
02:03:44,740 --> 02:03:45,573
I'll look up a bat.

4305
02:03:46,370 --> 02:03:47,280
That's definitely happened.

4306
02:03:47,730 --> 02:03:48,180
How many,

4307
02:03:48,180 --> 02:03:50,370
how often do people get
fucked up at baseball games?

4308
02:03:50,371 --> 02:03:52,800
Like in the audience like foul ball,

4309
02:03:53,040 --> 02:03:54,810
foul balls and shit hurt man.

4310
02:03:55,070 --> 02:03:56,280
Cause some of them get hurt them.

4311
02:03:56,281 --> 02:03:57,810
The line drive foul balls.

4312
02:03:57,811 --> 02:03:57,961
No,

4313
02:03:57,961 --> 02:03:59,910
right through someone's fucking forehead.

4314
02:03:59,970 --> 02:04:00,271
Oh yeah.

4315
02:04:00,271 --> 02:04:01,081
And how about bats?

4316
02:04:01,081 --> 02:04:02,010
They get hit with bats.

4317
02:04:02,430 --> 02:04:03,420
Bats are real scary.

4318
02:04:04,380 --> 02:04:04,980
Don't blame.

4319
02:04:04,980 --> 02:04:06,720
Don't try to fucking put that evil on me.

4320
02:04:06,721 --> 02:04:08,070
Jamie Barner videos.

4321
02:04:08,460 --> 02:04:09,620
It's just a picture of it,

4322
02:04:09,630 --> 02:04:10,463
but

4323
02:04:11,560 --> 02:04:12,240
I don't want to see it.

4324
02:04:12,240 --> 02:04:13,073
Man.

4325
02:04:13,130 --> 02:04:15,600
A baseball is a hard fucking rock.

4326
02:04:16,250 --> 02:04:18,910
It's a rock with a piece
of fucking leather over it.

4327
02:04:19,280 --> 02:04:20,041
They're all dangerous.

4328
02:04:20,041 --> 02:04:23,010
It's just sort of what ads some of the
risks and excitement to it that there's

4329
02:04:23,011 --> 02:04:24,300
something bad that can't happen.

4330
02:04:24,650 --> 02:04:25,483
You wouldn't want to get hit

4331
02:04:25,660 --> 02:04:26,850
the head with a soft ball.

4332
02:04:27,040 --> 02:04:28,000
Fuck a baseball.

4333
02:04:29,440 --> 02:04:31,660
I wouldn't want to get hit in
the head with a basketball.

4334
02:04:32,350 --> 02:04:33,180
Yeah,

4335
02:04:33,180 --> 02:04:33,950
around those flying.

4336
02:04:33,950 --> 02:04:36,020
They've jumped into the crowd
and land on you and fuck up.

4337
02:04:36,110 --> 02:04:37,290
Not only to your clothes are,

4338
02:04:37,291 --> 02:04:38,100
but like they could break

4339
02:04:38,100 --> 02:04:39,570
your leg or hurt a person.

4340
02:04:40,050 --> 02:04:40,461
People could.

4341
02:04:40,461 --> 02:04:40,820
One,

4342
02:04:40,820 --> 02:04:44,340
we get hit because I'm not
stupid and I'm a pussy.

4343
02:04:44,670 --> 02:04:45,061
Okay,

4344
02:04:45,061 --> 02:04:45,894
you happy?

4345
02:04:46,560 --> 02:04:48,570
I don't want to get hit
by a fucking baseball.

4346
02:04:48,720 --> 02:04:49,860
If I went to a baseball game,

4347
02:04:49,861 --> 02:04:52,740
I'd be like an armored knight
out of a shield and shit.

4348
02:04:52,741 --> 02:04:53,820
I'd be looking through the shield.

4349
02:04:55,680 --> 02:04:57,690
You walked down when I said it
and Columbus where I'm from.

4350
02:04:57,691 --> 02:04:57,961
One of the,

4351
02:04:57,961 --> 02:05:00,810
I think it was one of the first times
it happened to a hockey puck when flying

4352
02:05:00,811 --> 02:05:02,310
into the crowd and it
killed a little girl,

4353
02:05:02,760 --> 02:05:04,470
so they had to start
putting nets up around,

4354
02:05:04,860 --> 02:05:07,230
I think it started happening when
they've extended in baseball.

4355
02:05:07,231 --> 02:05:08,880
Now they're extending
the nets where people,

4356
02:05:09,280 --> 02:05:09,671
Jeremy,

4357
02:05:09,671 --> 02:05:10,660
Joe doesn't want me to have that.

4358
02:05:10,840 --> 02:05:11,561
Bums me out,

4359
02:05:11,561 --> 02:05:11,741
man.

4360
02:05:11,741 --> 02:05:12,220
You put that,

4361
02:05:12,220 --> 02:05:13,120
you put that evil on me,

4362
02:05:13,160 --> 02:05:13,441
Jamie.

4363
02:05:13,441 --> 02:05:14,274
Mom.

4364
02:05:14,800 --> 02:05:15,611
That's a,

4365
02:05:15,611 --> 02:05:17,290
that's cried during movies and stuff.

4366
02:05:17,410 --> 02:05:17,741
Yeah.

4367
02:05:17,741 --> 02:05:18,220
I'm up close.

4368
02:05:18,220 --> 02:05:19,320
See anytime there's,

4369
02:05:19,330 --> 02:05:19,870
if it's a good

4370
02:05:19,870 --> 02:05:20,410
movie,

4371
02:05:20,410 --> 02:05:20,831
I'm just,

4372
02:05:20,831 --> 02:05:23,680
I've always been a very emotional,

4373
02:05:23,770 --> 02:05:25,030
both up and down.

4374
02:05:25,440 --> 02:05:26,120
Passionate.

4375
02:05:26,120 --> 02:05:26,730
Yeah.

4376
02:05:26,730 --> 02:05:28,070
I'm a big crier.

4377
02:05:28,610 --> 02:05:28,950
Kidding.

4378
02:05:28,950 --> 02:05:31,830
I remember being 16 and I
got pulled over by the cops.

4379
02:05:32,130 --> 02:05:32,963
Fuck.

4380
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:34,440
We were leaving a party.

4381
02:05:35,010 --> 02:05:36,930
Me and my friend Willy
were leaving a party.

4382
02:05:36,931 --> 02:05:38,070
He smoked weed.

4383
02:05:38,100 --> 02:05:38,640
I didn't.

4384
02:05:38,640 --> 02:05:39,620
I was against weed.

4385
02:05:39,621 --> 02:05:42,120
I'm 16 we're at a fucking high school.

4386
02:05:42,121 --> 02:05:43,170
Part of it gets broken up by,

4387
02:05:43,171 --> 02:05:45,390
the cops were fucking drunk,

4388
02:05:45,391 --> 02:05:46,680
were hammered and I'm driving.

4389
02:05:46,681 --> 02:05:49,830
I didn't give a shit drunk
driving drunk driving.

4390
02:05:49,890 --> 02:05:51,300
I should be dead right now.

4391
02:05:51,301 --> 02:05:53,430
I should be told this is all fiction.

4392
02:05:53,460 --> 02:05:54,990
None of this actually happened.

4393
02:05:55,130 --> 02:05:55,620
So,

4394
02:05:55,620 --> 02:05:55,960
so I'm,

4395
02:05:55,960 --> 02:05:56,793
I'm sitting in,

4396
02:05:56,850 --> 02:05:57,930
I'm sitting in,

4397
02:05:57,990 --> 02:05:59,940
I turn on the car mean willing.

4398
02:06:00,840 --> 02:06:02,370
As soon as I turn on the car,

4399
02:06:02,371 --> 02:06:03,420
fucking cop right here,

4400
02:06:03,421 --> 02:06:05,400
just waiting for me comes up like,

4401
02:06:05,490 --> 02:06:06,930
Oh shit,

4402
02:06:07,230 --> 02:06:08,640
I'm fucked up.

4403
02:06:09,180 --> 02:06:10,620
I was drunk.

4404
02:06:11,160 --> 02:06:11,431
He,

4405
02:06:11,431 --> 02:06:12,570
I rolled down the window,

4406
02:06:12,990 --> 02:06:14,850
he pulled us out of the car.

4407
02:06:14,970 --> 02:06:18,590
I'm already crying and shaking and like
buy the car crying and check Willie's.

4408
02:06:18,600 --> 02:06:21,990
I kind of cool like that and I'm crying
and shaking and then the cop pulls out,

4409
02:06:22,050 --> 02:06:24,810
he searches my car and I
just tell them the truth.

4410
02:06:24,811 --> 02:06:25,260
I just,

4411
02:06:25,260 --> 02:06:25,950
they said,

4412
02:06:25,950 --> 02:06:27,330
what's this cooler back here?

4413
02:06:27,331 --> 02:06:28,110
And I said,

4414
02:06:28,110 --> 02:06:28,943
it's a,

4415
02:06:29,310 --> 02:06:30,450
it's a wine coolers.

4416
02:06:30,451 --> 02:06:30,711
Cause I,

4417
02:06:30,711 --> 02:06:31,890
I drank wine coolers.

4418
02:06:31,891 --> 02:06:32,601
I was a big pussy.

4419
02:06:32,601 --> 02:06:33,391
Everyone drank beer.

4420
02:06:33,391 --> 02:06:34,920
But I was the pussy
that drank wine coolers.

4421
02:06:34,921 --> 02:06:35,754
I didn't care.

4422
02:06:35,850 --> 02:06:36,683
I didn't care.

4423
02:06:36,750 --> 02:06:38,550
I'm drinking so much
out of cool to filters,

4424
02:06:38,551 --> 02:06:39,360
wine coolers.

4425
02:06:39,360 --> 02:06:39,631
And he goes,

4426
02:06:39,631 --> 02:06:39,811
what's,

4427
02:06:39,811 --> 02:06:40,381
what's in that?

4428
02:06:40,381 --> 02:06:40,741
And I said,

4429
02:06:40,741 --> 02:06:41,401
wine coolers.

4430
02:06:41,401 --> 02:06:42,540
I just admitted to him like,

4431
02:06:42,920 --> 02:06:43,860
I been drinking,

4432
02:06:44,100 --> 02:06:44,701
I got admitted,

4433
02:06:44,701 --> 02:06:45,300
I'm drunk.

4434
02:06:45,300 --> 02:06:46,200
I started crying.

4435
02:06:47,040 --> 02:06:49,530
I was just crying like
a fucking little bitch.

4436
02:06:49,680 --> 02:06:54,680
And then he pulls out my
ashtray and there's this all
this brown ashy stuff that

4437
02:06:54,811 --> 02:06:56,490
to this day I don't know what it is.

4438
02:06:56,670 --> 02:06:57,720
And he pulls out and goes,

4439
02:06:57,721 --> 02:06:58,554
what is this?

4440
02:06:58,560 --> 02:06:59,393
I looked at it,

4441
02:07:01,310 --> 02:07:02,190
it's weed,

4442
02:07:02,191 --> 02:07:03,180
it's marijuana.

4443
02:07:03,270 --> 02:07:04,110
And it wasn't,

4444
02:07:04,111 --> 02:07:06,300
but I didn't even know what
weed and marijuana look like.

4445
02:07:06,600 --> 02:07:07,433
I didn't even know.

4446
02:07:07,530 --> 02:07:08,220
But he goes,

4447
02:07:08,220 --> 02:07:09,490
that's read and marijuana go.

4448
02:07:09,491 --> 02:07:09,930
Yeah,

4449
02:07:09,930 --> 02:07:11,050
it's weed and marijuana.

4450
02:07:11,051 --> 02:07:11,884
It's his.

4451
02:07:12,330 --> 02:07:13,200
I'm crying,

4452
02:07:13,260 --> 02:07:14,790
throwing my friend under the bus.

4453
02:07:15,100 --> 02:07:18,510
And it was obviously not
weed and there's the,

4454
02:07:19,260 --> 02:07:20,093
I don't know,

4455
02:07:20,160 --> 02:07:20,491
I don't know.

4456
02:07:20,491 --> 02:07:22,140
Some kind of some kind of ash.

4457
02:07:22,290 --> 02:07:23,340
I was so stupid.

4458
02:07:23,490 --> 02:07:24,610
I'm crying in the meeting.

4459
02:07:24,620 --> 02:07:25,021
Even the cops,

4460
02:07:25,021 --> 02:07:25,260
guests,

4461
02:07:25,260 --> 02:07:25,921
I've been drinking.

4462
02:07:25,921 --> 02:07:26,650
I'm drunk,

4463
02:07:26,650 --> 02:07:27,483
man.

4464
02:07:27,570 --> 02:07:28,620
That's marijuana.

4465
02:07:28,710 --> 02:07:29,820
And he's sitting there thinking,

4466
02:07:30,090 --> 02:07:31,290
that's not marijuana.

4467
02:07:31,291 --> 02:07:33,000
But he's saying it's marijuana.

4468
02:07:33,510 --> 02:07:35,010
They were confused.

4469
02:07:35,080 --> 02:07:35,920
You know what they did?

4470
02:07:36,250 --> 02:07:38,080
They said getting your car and go home.

4471
02:07:39,790 --> 02:07:41,290
They didn't arrest me or anything.

4472
02:07:41,650 --> 02:07:41,950
I said,

4473
02:07:41,950 --> 02:07:42,581
getting your car.

4474
02:07:42,581 --> 02:07:43,690
Get the fuck Outta here.

4475
02:07:44,620 --> 02:07:45,730
I confessed everything.

4476
02:07:45,731 --> 02:07:46,990
I confess too much.

4477
02:07:47,080 --> 02:07:48,100
They didn't know what to do with it.

4478
02:07:49,600 --> 02:07:52,840
I told them I was drinking
and drunk and they let me go.

4479
02:07:52,990 --> 02:07:56,560
You told them that something wasn't pot
or it was pot when it was a pot and they

4480
02:07:56,561 --> 02:07:57,940
knew it wasn't pot and I'm like crying.

4481
02:07:57,941 --> 02:07:58,774
It's crazy.

4482
02:07:59,890 --> 02:08:01,120
It's weed.

4483
02:08:01,810 --> 02:08:02,180
And they go,

4484
02:08:02,180 --> 02:08:03,013
well,

4485
02:08:03,290 --> 02:08:06,100
we just saw you and saw
just a gang of paperwork.

4486
02:08:06,160 --> 02:08:06,970
Yes,

4487
02:08:06,970 --> 02:08:08,020
this is too much work.

4488
02:08:08,190 --> 02:08:09,520
Let me drive,

4489
02:08:09,521 --> 02:08:10,354
dude.

4490
02:08:10,370 --> 02:08:11,590
They let me drive.

4491
02:08:11,740 --> 02:08:12,970
They were so confused.

4492
02:08:13,660 --> 02:08:17,130
I told them I was drunk and they
let a 16 year old boy drive home.

4493
02:08:17,710 --> 02:08:18,451
Did they follow you?

4494
02:08:18,451 --> 02:08:20,560
That was the coolest cop ever.

4495
02:08:20,590 --> 02:08:21,423
Did they follow you?

4496
02:08:21,680 --> 02:08:22,360
I don't know.

4497
02:08:22,360 --> 02:08:23,620
I was fucking drove home.

4498
02:08:23,860 --> 02:08:26,110
That's that Peter Parker
Spiderman thing though.

4499
02:08:26,500 --> 02:08:28,600
Like what if a cop lets you
go and you kill somebody?

4500
02:08:29,180 --> 02:08:30,250
You know and you know that story.

4501
02:08:31,690 --> 02:08:32,523
It's like,

4502
02:08:32,740 --> 02:08:36,100
it's really fascinating because I'm sure
Joseph Campbell would say that it's in

4503
02:08:36,310 --> 02:08:38,980
one of those heroes journeys that,

4504
02:08:38,981 --> 02:08:39,101
uh,

4505
02:08:39,101 --> 02:08:39,310
he,

4506
02:08:39,310 --> 02:08:39,600
he,

4507
02:08:39,600 --> 02:08:40,331
he talks about,

4508
02:08:40,331 --> 02:08:41,790
but in Spiderman,

4509
02:08:42,430 --> 02:08:43,390
Peter Parker,

4510
02:08:43,510 --> 02:08:48,340
who's this scientist kid gets bitten by
this radioactive spider and he gains the

4511
02:08:48,380 --> 02:08:53,380
superpowers and he sort of realized
that he gains these superpowers and he's

4512
02:08:53,831 --> 02:08:57,010
headed towards his,

4513
02:08:57,011 --> 02:08:57,820
uh,

4514
02:08:57,820 --> 02:09:00,340
w was his grandparents that he lived with,

4515
02:09:00,430 --> 02:09:03,130
or his aunt and his uncle
was his aunt and his uncle.

4516
02:09:04,030 --> 02:09:04,870
And they took,

4517
02:09:04,871 --> 02:09:06,070
they were taking care of them.

4518
02:09:06,400 --> 02:09:07,031
And uh,

4519
02:09:07,031 --> 02:09:11,740
along the way he ran into some robber
and he let the Robert go cause he's like,

4520
02:09:11,741 --> 02:09:13,120
this is a story of Spiderman.

4521
02:09:13,150 --> 02:09:13,441
Yes.

4522
02:09:13,441 --> 02:09:13,751
He's like,

4523
02:09:13,751 --> 02:09:15,040
this is not my business.

4524
02:09:15,110 --> 02:09:15,580
Right.

4525
02:09:15,580 --> 02:09:18,310
The robber kills his uncle.

4526
02:09:19,330 --> 02:09:22,750
So he had the opportunity to stop the
Robert and he didn't do anything and his

4527
02:09:22,751 --> 02:09:23,650
uncle died.

4528
02:09:23,920 --> 02:09:27,370
And so now he takes care of his
aunt and he's fucking Spiderman.

4529
02:09:27,760 --> 02:09:28,780
He's pissed.

4530
02:09:29,200 --> 02:09:30,340
So he puts a mask on.

4531
02:09:30,370 --> 02:09:35,090
He uses his powers now and
stops crime all around golf.

4532
02:09:35,110 --> 02:09:35,861
And that makes sense.

4533
02:09:35,861 --> 02:09:37,270
So that's why he's obsessed with New York.

4534
02:09:37,390 --> 02:09:37,601
Yeah.

4535
02:09:37,601 --> 02:09:37,871
He says,

4536
02:09:37,871 --> 02:09:38,560
my fault,

4537
02:09:38,560 --> 02:09:39,393
my fault,

4538
02:09:40,620 --> 02:09:41,530
all my fault.

4539
02:09:41,710 --> 02:09:43,450
If I had only stopped
him when I could have,

4540
02:09:43,451 --> 02:09:44,171
but I didn't.

4541
02:09:44,171 --> 02:09:48,100
And now my uncle Ben is dead
and I didn't know the backstory.

4542
02:09:48,370 --> 02:09:48,731
I hate,

4543
02:09:48,731 --> 02:09:49,480
you know me.

4544
02:09:49,480 --> 02:09:50,470
I've said it several times.

4545
02:09:50,471 --> 02:09:53,530
I hate super hero movies.

4546
02:09:53,531 --> 02:09:54,670
I can't fucking stand him.

4547
02:09:54,671 --> 02:09:55,504
But guess what?

4548
02:09:55,600 --> 02:09:56,770
I'm addicted to Gotham.

4549
02:09:56,920 --> 02:09:58,900
Fucking love the backstory of that man.

4550
02:09:58,930 --> 02:09:59,201
Really?

4551
02:09:59,201 --> 02:09:59,921
You kidding me?

4552
02:09:59,921 --> 02:10:00,610
Have you seen it?

4553
02:10:00,610 --> 02:10:00,891
No,

4554
02:10:00,891 --> 02:10:01,601
it was at a show.

4555
02:10:01,601 --> 02:10:02,490
Is it a Netflix show?

4556
02:10:02,710 --> 02:10:03,401
Yes.

4557
02:10:03,401 --> 02:10:04,840
I'm scared dude.

4558
02:10:05,320 --> 02:10:07,680
It's the backstory of Batman.

4559
02:10:07,830 --> 02:10:08,710
Batman as a kid.

4560
02:10:09,570 --> 02:10:10,480
I don't have that time.

4561
02:10:10,600 --> 02:10:11,530
Oh it's so good.

4562
02:10:11,730 --> 02:10:12,040
Okay,

4563
02:10:12,040 --> 02:10:13,160
I'll watch it and I,

4564
02:10:14,020 --> 02:10:16,480
I hate superheroes,

4565
02:10:16,750 --> 02:10:20,440
but I'm of all of a sudden knowing
the backstory of all the villains,

4566
02:10:20,441 --> 02:10:20,980
the joker,

4567
02:10:20,980 --> 02:10:21,370
the writ,

4568
02:10:21,370 --> 02:10:22,560
you get all their backstory,

4569
02:10:22,570 --> 02:10:23,403
how it all happened,

4570
02:10:23,440 --> 02:10:24,460
how it all went down.

4571
02:10:24,640 --> 02:10:25,630
It's so God,

4572
02:10:25,870 --> 02:10:26,651
I fucking love it.

4573
02:10:26,651 --> 02:10:28,900
It's like the mob runs Gotham city.

4574
02:10:28,901 --> 02:10:31,510
The mob just fucking runs the police.

4575
02:10:31,511 --> 02:10:32,081
Everybody.

4576
02:10:32,081 --> 02:10:32,410
It's,

4577
02:10:32,410 --> 02:10:34,130
it's the most corrupt

4578
02:10:34,190 --> 02:10:36,530
city ever in the entire world.

4579
02:10:36,531 --> 02:10:38,310
That's the most corrupt city cop.

4580
02:10:38,311 --> 02:10:39,020
Stoney.

4581
02:10:39,020 --> 02:10:41,660
There's just some motherfuckers
you just don't investigate.

4582
02:10:42,080 --> 02:10:43,010
Cause that you'll die.

4583
02:10:43,520 --> 02:10:44,560
It's so corrupted,

4584
02:10:44,561 --> 02:10:45,510
saw mob and,

4585
02:10:45,511 --> 02:10:46,130
and uh,

4586
02:10:46,130 --> 02:10:48,680
it's basically about him as a kid,

4587
02:10:48,681 --> 02:10:49,760
but mostly about,

4588
02:10:50,140 --> 02:10:50,450
uh,

4589
02:10:50,450 --> 02:10:52,220
Gordon Commissioner Gordon,

4590
02:10:52,280 --> 02:10:53,740
how he some,

4591
02:10:53,810 --> 02:10:54,280
he's a,

4592
02:10:54,280 --> 02:10:54,610
you know,

4593
02:10:54,610 --> 02:10:55,790
Batman's a Katie's like 12,

4594
02:10:55,791 --> 02:10:58,070
but he's a super genius
and his parents got killed.

4595
02:10:58,250 --> 02:11:01,100
He's like a super billionaire as well.

4596
02:11:01,110 --> 02:11:01,370
His,

4597
02:11:01,370 --> 02:11:03,230
his parents that got killed
right in front of them.

4598
02:11:03,650 --> 02:11:07,490
He spends his whole life trying to find
the people that killed his parents.

4599
02:11:07,610 --> 02:11:11,740
And that's how it becomes Batman is
trying to in Gotham it's fucking good.

4600
02:11:11,741 --> 02:11:11,901
You know,

4601
02:11:11,901 --> 02:11:12,734
I was thinking,

4602
02:11:12,810 --> 02:11:13,880
you were telling me this.

4603
02:11:14,060 --> 02:11:19,060
Imagine if you lived in a world that
looked like those fucking Batman movies

4604
02:11:20,181 --> 02:11:25,181
look like all gray and gloomy and they're
trying to make it super realistic.

4605
02:11:25,700 --> 02:11:27,080
They're trying to like,

4606
02:11:27,140 --> 02:11:28,550
like how are these guys,

4607
02:11:28,850 --> 02:11:32,690
how do they end up in these
fucking tights and these outfits,

4608
02:11:32,870 --> 02:11:36,640
they're showing how it's happening
in the in crime and the show.

4609
02:11:36,740 --> 02:11:38,630
But what I'm saying is when
you watch those movies,

4610
02:11:38,660 --> 02:11:39,740
they're trying to make it believable.

4611
02:11:39,800 --> 02:11:40,491
But you know what I'm saying?

4612
02:11:40,491 --> 02:11:42,800
It's always like gloomy
and dark and black.

4613
02:11:43,070 --> 02:11:44,720
Like if you lived in that world.

4614
02:11:44,920 --> 02:11:45,250
Whoa.

4615
02:11:45,250 --> 02:11:45,641
What?

4616
02:11:45,641 --> 02:11:47,180
What kind of happiness do you think you,

4617
02:11:47,210 --> 02:11:49,240
what level of happiness do you
think people would find it?

4618
02:11:49,250 --> 02:11:50,570
A world where it never got sunny.

4619
02:11:50,600 --> 02:11:51,680
It's all shot like that too.

4620
02:11:51,681 --> 02:11:52,820
It's all like real.

4621
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:55,160
It's like game of Thrones production.

4622
02:11:55,161 --> 02:11:55,980
The lighting is,

4623
02:11:55,980 --> 02:11:57,800
every shot is magical.

4624
02:11:57,980 --> 02:12:01,010
It isn't like when you watch like
the office and shit about the shot,

4625
02:12:01,340 --> 02:12:01,611
you know?

4626
02:12:01,611 --> 02:12:02,420
But the shot,

4627
02:12:02,420 --> 02:12:03,253
everything,

4628
02:12:03,330 --> 02:12:04,100
the lighting,

4629
02:12:04,100 --> 02:12:05,810
not like game of Thrones style,

4630
02:12:05,840 --> 02:12:06,940
like they're trying to make it look,

4631
02:12:07,150 --> 02:12:07,840
I don't have,

4632
02:12:07,840 --> 02:12:08,240
everything's,

4633
02:12:08,240 --> 02:12:11,330
epic's not as much of
a feature that's epic.

4634
02:12:11,330 --> 02:12:12,290
Like every shot,

4635
02:12:12,440 --> 02:12:14,060
they spend a lot of time on the,

4636
02:12:14,210 --> 02:12:15,043
on the lighting.

4637
02:12:15,050 --> 02:12:15,883
It's re shot.

4638
02:12:15,890 --> 02:12:16,581
Amazing.

4639
02:12:16,581 --> 02:12:16,751
It's,

4640
02:12:16,751 --> 02:12:18,890
it's a great story.

4641
02:12:19,280 --> 02:12:21,260
It makes a guy who hates superheroes.

4642
02:12:21,261 --> 02:12:21,500
Fuck,

4643
02:12:21,500 --> 02:12:22,101
I'm addicted.

4644
02:12:22,101 --> 02:12:22,831
I love that man.

4645
02:12:22,831 --> 02:12:23,631
Now I'm in the Batman.

4646
02:12:23,631 --> 02:12:26,810
If we all lived in a world where
it was that dark and gloomy,

4647
02:12:26,870 --> 02:12:28,970
I bet we'd be miserable as fuck.

4648
02:12:29,200 --> 02:12:29,650
I had it.

4649
02:12:29,650 --> 02:12:30,830
We super hard.

4650
02:12:31,430 --> 02:12:34,310
It was super hard for people to feel good.

4651
02:12:34,370 --> 02:12:37,160
We're so tuned into wanting
that light on our face.

4652
02:12:37,700 --> 02:12:38,540
It's amazing,

4653
02:12:38,541 --> 02:12:39,080
man.

4654
02:12:39,080 --> 02:12:39,561
It's amazing.

4655
02:12:39,561 --> 02:12:39,750
You know,

4656
02:12:39,750 --> 02:12:40,551
I started watching,

4657
02:12:40,551 --> 02:12:41,660
I would have never started watching,

4658
02:12:41,661 --> 02:12:45,300
but I have a friend who's
like conspiracy theorists,

4659
02:12:45,301 --> 02:12:46,130
dude who uh,

4660
02:12:46,130 --> 02:12:48,170
his name is ride Dawson is like his,

4661
02:12:48,290 --> 02:12:48,650
his,

4662
02:12:48,650 --> 02:12:49,610
he lives in Japan.

4663
02:12:49,700 --> 02:12:54,080
Some American guy who just
all is a con JFK and nine 11,

4664
02:12:54,460 --> 02:12:54,770
uh,

4665
02:12:54,770 --> 02:12:55,400
expert.

4666
02:12:55,400 --> 02:12:58,020
He spends his whole life on
those two things as well.

4667
02:12:58,110 --> 02:13:00,620
And one was in Dune hanging around
with at parties and he goes,

4668
02:13:00,621 --> 02:13:01,040
he goes,

4669
02:13:01,040 --> 02:13:02,480
you want to know how shit really is?

4670
02:13:02,481 --> 02:13:04,820
Run as watch Gotham if you watch Gotham,

4671
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:05,721
that's how it's run.

4672
02:13:05,721 --> 02:13:06,554
Exactly.

4673
02:13:06,670 --> 02:13:07,071
And I said,

4674
02:13:07,071 --> 02:13:07,460
really?

4675
02:13:07,460 --> 02:13:07,820
He goes,

4676
02:13:07,820 --> 02:13:08,481
that's how it's run.

4677
02:13:08,481 --> 02:13:09,440
So I'm watching it going,

4678
02:13:09,441 --> 02:13:10,274
Shit.

4679
02:13:10,310 --> 02:13:11,090
Um,

4680
02:13:11,090 --> 02:13:11,380
it,

4681
02:13:11,380 --> 02:13:11,870
uh,

4682
02:13:11,870 --> 02:13:12,080
it,

4683
02:13:12,080 --> 02:13:12,913
uh,

4684
02:13:13,190 --> 02:13:14,270
it's all based on money.

4685
02:13:14,300 --> 02:13:15,530
Everything is based on money.

4686
02:13:15,531 --> 02:13:17,720
You could just follow the money
when you follow the money.

4687
02:13:17,780 --> 02:13:18,080
Oh,

4688
02:13:18,080 --> 02:13:19,460
you need a circle.

4689
02:13:19,640 --> 02:13:19,791
Well,

4690
02:13:19,791 --> 02:13:20,624
anyways,

4691
02:13:20,660 --> 02:13:21,141
you know what,

4692
02:13:21,141 --> 02:13:21,440
uh,

4693
02:13:21,440 --> 02:13:22,273
um,

4694
02:13:22,580 --> 02:13:23,391
what do you think of Mitch?

4695
02:13:23,391 --> 02:13:26,600
You Michio Kaku xe is he,

4696
02:13:26,601 --> 02:13:27,260
uh,

4697
02:13:27,260 --> 02:13:28,730
he's a brilliant physicist.

4698
02:13:28,760 --> 02:13:29,420
Totally right.

4699
02:13:29,420 --> 02:13:30,260
Interesting guy.

4700
02:13:30,261 --> 02:13:32,130
He's got some interesting
things to say about a lot

4701
02:13:32,130 --> 02:13:32,963
of different things.

4702
02:13:33,030 --> 02:13:33,211
Well,

4703
02:13:33,211 --> 02:13:34,910
what I would say is on your show.

4704
02:13:34,980 --> 02:13:35,371
No,

4705
02:13:35,371 --> 02:13:35,761
no,

4706
02:13:35,761 --> 02:13:37,170
I've been with him on the opiate.

4707
02:13:37,171 --> 02:13:37,890
Anthony showed those.

4708
02:13:37,890 --> 02:13:39,060
Asks him about mushrooms.

4709
02:13:39,860 --> 02:13:41,130
You been on a show with him?

4710
02:13:41,340 --> 02:13:41,910
Yeah.

4711
02:13:41,910 --> 02:13:42,743
Oh Shit.

4712
02:13:43,010 --> 02:13:46,890
I was calling in man and I just bombed
him with some mushrooms questions.

4713
02:13:46,891 --> 02:13:48,390
So what did he sound when he called in?

4714
02:13:48,391 --> 02:13:49,740
Maybe he called in and I was there,

4715
02:13:49,770 --> 02:13:50,670
I forget how it worked.

4716
02:13:50,730 --> 02:13:51,660
I forget what you think.

4717
02:13:51,661 --> 02:13:52,580
Michio Kaku smokes.

4718
02:13:52,590 --> 02:13:53,850
Wade negative.

4719
02:13:53,880 --> 02:13:54,713
Negative sir.

4720
02:13:54,720 --> 02:13:56,450
Negative does not do any drugs.

4721
02:13:56,480 --> 02:13:57,313
Cause I said to him,

4722
02:13:57,350 --> 02:13:59,010
you asked him about psychedelics?

4723
02:13:59,011 --> 02:13:59,161
Yeah.

4724
02:13:59,161 --> 02:13:59,980
Oh yeah.

4725
02:13:59,980 --> 02:14:01,080
I asked him about mushrooms.

4726
02:14:01,081 --> 02:14:01,501
He said well,

4727
02:14:01,501 --> 02:14:02,870
we're not trying to uh,

4728
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:04,280
give ourselves brain damage.

4729
02:14:04,281 --> 02:14:05,310
We're trying to get smarter.

4730
02:14:05,490 --> 02:14:06,323
It was one of those like,

4731
02:14:06,540 --> 02:14:07,140
look man,

4732
02:14:07,140 --> 02:14:10,680
that guy is like a paid science educator.

4733
02:14:10,740 --> 02:14:11,100
Right,

4734
02:14:11,100 --> 02:14:11,401
okay.

4735
02:14:11,401 --> 02:14:15,720
What he does is try to spread science all
over the world and when you're in that

4736
02:14:15,721 --> 02:14:18,180
realm you need funding for stuff.

4737
02:14:18,180 --> 02:14:21,570
You need people to
greenlight your TV projects.

4738
02:14:21,571 --> 02:14:26,070
You've got to avoid criticism
at all costs and any,

4739
02:14:26,970 --> 02:14:31,970
anytime your saying that it's probably
a good idea to do certain drugs.

4740
02:14:34,080 --> 02:14:34,500
That's,

4741
02:14:34,500 --> 02:14:35,333
that's just,

4742
02:14:35,880 --> 02:14:36,330
you can't,

4743
02:14:36,330 --> 02:14:39,000
that you can't say yes
if you do mushrooms.

4744
02:14:39,200 --> 02:14:39,470
It's,

4745
02:14:39,470 --> 02:14:43,200
it's very possible that you might be
in contact with entities from other

4746
02:14:43,201 --> 02:14:45,420
dimensions for which to be dead.

4747
02:14:45,600 --> 02:14:47,430
If he did do me probably wouldn't said,

4748
02:14:47,490 --> 02:14:47,671
oh,

4749
02:14:47,671 --> 02:14:48,570
he's probably what?

4750
02:14:48,870 --> 02:14:53,870
Almost anybody who's really smart who
does like a dose of DMT comes back and

4751
02:14:54,601 --> 02:14:54,751
goes,

4752
02:14:54,751 --> 02:14:54,991
okay,

4753
02:14:54,991 --> 02:14:56,820
what the fuck is that all about?

4754
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:57,511
He did.

4755
02:14:57,511 --> 02:14:59,660
He was in this amazing documentary,

4756
02:14:59,700 --> 02:15:03,210
just a fucking life changing
documentary called the principal.

4757
02:15:03,211 --> 02:15:03,720
Have you seen that?

4758
02:15:03,720 --> 02:15:03,961
No,

4759
02:15:03,961 --> 02:15:04,794
I have not.

4760
02:15:04,800 --> 02:15:05,551
Fuck.

4761
02:15:05,551 --> 02:15:06,630
And Kokkos in it,

4762
02:15:06,631 --> 02:15:07,680
a bunch of physicists,

4763
02:15:07,681 --> 02:15:09,480
like professors from Mit.

4764
02:15:09,630 --> 02:15:11,370
It's just a bunch of dudes and like route,

4765
02:15:11,371 --> 02:15:12,690
like religious scientists too.

4766
02:15:12,690 --> 02:15:13,900
They have like two or three of that.

4767
02:15:14,200 --> 02:15:15,740
And the reason it's 10,

4768
02:15:15,741 --> 02:15:16,531
it's called the principal.

4769
02:15:16,531 --> 02:15:17,161
Is it recent?

4770
02:15:17,161 --> 02:15:17,994
Two years.

4771
02:15:18,120 --> 02:15:18,701
And uh,

4772
02:15:18,701 --> 02:15:18,811
it's,

4773
02:15:18,811 --> 02:15:19,020
uh,

4774
02:15:19,020 --> 02:15:23,280
it's just like 10 dude's
like a navigation expert,

4775
02:15:23,580 --> 02:15:25,890
physicist Michio Kaku.

4776
02:15:25,891 --> 02:15:27,330
And then I'll just go on back and forth,

4777
02:15:27,600 --> 02:15:27,811
you know,

4778
02:15:27,811 --> 02:15:31,470
all these astrophysicists and cosmologists
and she'd gone back and forth,

4779
02:15:31,690 --> 02:15:32,100
uh,

4780
02:15:32,100 --> 02:15:32,970
discussing,

4781
02:15:33,480 --> 02:15:34,313
um,

4782
02:15:34,440 --> 02:15:37,650
space and they give you a timeline.

4783
02:15:37,860 --> 02:15:39,870
It's an awesome high end document.

4784
02:15:39,871 --> 02:15:44,871
They give you a timeline of why we believe
what we believe about space and shit.

4785
02:15:46,350 --> 02:15:47,970
Fuck it is,

4786
02:15:48,060 --> 02:15:51,390
it will melt your fucking brain.

4787
02:15:51,750 --> 02:15:52,950
Do the craziest shit.

4788
02:15:53,100 --> 02:15:56,130
Have you ever heard of the
cosmic microwave background?

4789
02:15:56,250 --> 02:15:59,670
You know what that is the noise
that they indicate that they,

4790
02:15:59,800 --> 02:16:01,280
it indicates the Big Bang.

4791
02:16:02,420 --> 02:16:04,950
It's the afterglow of the big bang.

4792
02:16:05,660 --> 02:16:06,630
So I don't know,

4793
02:16:06,631 --> 02:16:06,811
Dude.

4794
02:16:06,811 --> 02:16:09,910
I don't know if this is what we
called the afterglow radiation.

4795
02:16:10,250 --> 02:16:11,670
It's like the big bang.

4796
02:16:11,671 --> 02:16:15,620
It's like the radiation rounds
left over after the big bank.

4797
02:16:15,660 --> 02:16:17,790
Whatever the fuck that means.

4798
02:16:18,120 --> 02:16:18,650
Do you know?

4799
02:16:18,650 --> 02:16:20,400
But when you start going on about that,

4800
02:16:20,430 --> 02:16:22,230
I get lost in the mix.

4801
02:16:22,290 --> 02:16:23,760
But the crazy thing about it though,

4802
02:16:23,790 --> 02:16:24,810
this is the crazy thing about,

4803
02:16:24,840 --> 02:16:26,220
I don't know shit about that.

4804
02:16:26,221 --> 02:16:28,590
All I do is just watch them
space documentaries were fed.

4805
02:16:28,800 --> 02:16:30,100
I used to be addicted at space

4806
02:16:30,100 --> 02:16:30,933
documentaries.

4807
02:16:31,240 --> 02:16:33,310
And then when you watch this documentary,

4808
02:16:33,520 --> 02:16:37,870
you're fine and you find out why
we believe what we believe and the,

4809
02:16:37,890 --> 02:16:38,141
you know,

4810
02:16:38,141 --> 02:16:39,550
the timeline of,

4811
02:16:39,551 --> 02:16:40,010
uh,

4812
02:16:40,010 --> 02:16:42,460
a taller may to Copernicus,

4813
02:16:42,610 --> 02:16:43,570
to Kepler,

4814
02:16:43,720 --> 02:16:45,230
to Galileo and all that,

4815
02:16:45,400 --> 02:16:45,670
that,

4816
02:16:45,670 --> 02:16:45,870
that,

4817
02:16:45,870 --> 02:16:48,660
that timeline of what people
thought and believe in everywhere.

4818
02:16:48,670 --> 02:16:52,920
It was always a battle of all of
these astronomers study and the,

4819
02:16:53,020 --> 02:16:54,340
the lights in the sky,

4820
02:16:54,341 --> 02:16:56,140
that's all they saw was
the lights in the sky.

4821
02:16:56,290 --> 02:16:57,010
Stunning goes,

4822
02:16:57,010 --> 02:16:58,090
everything goes this way,

4823
02:16:58,091 --> 02:16:59,680
except those wandering stars.

4824
02:16:59,800 --> 02:17:02,140
And then they figured out those
wandering stars were planets.

4825
02:17:02,141 --> 02:17:02,801
And then from there I'll go,

4826
02:17:02,801 --> 02:17:03,400
okay,

4827
02:17:03,400 --> 02:17:04,151
those are the plants,

4828
02:17:04,151 --> 02:17:06,910
because they're the only ones
that are on their own course.

4829
02:17:07,150 --> 02:17:08,590
So they're all trying to figure out,

4830
02:17:08,890 --> 02:17:12,820
is the universe spinning around
us or are we spin around universe?

4831
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:15,040
That's always the fucking at,

4832
02:17:15,041 --> 02:17:15,970
it's always been,

4833
02:17:16,720 --> 02:17:17,530
we think like,

4834
02:17:17,530 --> 02:17:18,610
like I always thought,

4835
02:17:18,700 --> 02:17:19,001
oh,

4836
02:17:19,001 --> 02:17:19,570
they're dumb.

4837
02:17:19,570 --> 02:17:24,280
Back then they thought they thought the
world was the center of the universe and

4838
02:17:24,281 --> 02:17:25,060
all that shit.

4839
02:17:25,060 --> 02:17:26,110
And you look back at that,

4840
02:17:26,230 --> 02:17:27,730
you don't really look into,

4841
02:17:27,850 --> 02:17:29,980
unless you know the actual timeline.

4842
02:17:30,160 --> 02:17:30,761
It's crazy.

4843
02:17:30,761 --> 02:17:33,940
Hearing all these scientists going back
to the and you hear them explaining

4844
02:17:34,210 --> 02:17:34,661
what,

4845
02:17:34,661 --> 02:17:35,890
how it all went down.

4846
02:17:36,180 --> 02:17:36,550
You,

4847
02:17:36,550 --> 02:17:38,140
once you go through that whole,

4848
02:17:38,350 --> 02:17:41,720
the whole story of what we
think about space and all that,

4849
02:17:42,280 --> 02:17:43,690
they tell you,

4850
02:17:43,780 --> 02:17:47,290
they tell you we don't know shit.

4851
02:17:47,590 --> 02:17:50,690
We're looking at a bunch of
lights and the Goddamn sky.

4852
02:17:50,970 --> 02:17:55,900
You're going to tell me that that light
and that light that's 200 and 5,000

4853
02:17:55,901 --> 02:17:57,490
trillion light years away.

4854
02:17:57,790 --> 02:18:00,450
How the fuck did you figure
that out and you learn?

4855
02:18:00,490 --> 02:18:02,020
Don't they have an
explanation for that shit?

4856
02:18:02,080 --> 02:18:02,381
No,

4857
02:18:02,381 --> 02:18:03,041
exactly.

4858
02:18:03,041 --> 02:18:05,350
That's what every what
you just said right now.

4859
02:18:05,740 --> 02:18:09,700
Now's what everyone's natural reaction
because anytime someone says anything

4860
02:18:09,701 --> 02:18:10,810
about space,

4861
02:18:11,440 --> 02:18:15,190
you automatically think
someone figured it out.

4862
02:18:15,250 --> 02:18:16,600
You don't know the guy's name.

4863
02:18:16,660 --> 02:18:18,280
You don't know the name of the experiment.

4864
02:18:18,370 --> 02:18:19,930
You didn't look into it yourself.

4865
02:18:19,931 --> 02:18:23,830
You just think when someone tells you
how far is the earth from the sun?

4866
02:18:24,040 --> 02:18:24,131
Oh,

4867
02:18:24,131 --> 02:18:24,964
say Oh,

4868
02:18:25,390 --> 02:18:27,430
93 million miles away.

4869
02:18:27,640 --> 02:18:28,473
Like you just,

4870
02:18:28,560 --> 02:18:28,970
you,

4871
02:18:28,970 --> 02:18:29,530
you,

4872
02:18:29,530 --> 02:18:34,530
everybody relies on someone figured
that out and someone double checked it.

4873
02:18:36,130 --> 02:18:36,401
Dude,

4874
02:18:36,401 --> 02:18:37,240
it's math.

4875
02:18:37,360 --> 02:18:38,230
It's science.

4876
02:18:38,260 --> 02:18:38,890
It's math.

4877
02:18:38,890 --> 02:18:42,630
But no one really knows you're going on
what you read and whatever hits you for

4878
02:18:42,650 --> 02:18:42,960
me.

4879
02:18:42,960 --> 02:18:43,810
No one like that.

4880
02:18:43,811 --> 02:18:44,680
We're talking to you.

4881
02:18:45,300 --> 02:18:46,133
I'm going to buy.

4882
02:18:46,820 --> 02:18:47,350
Yeah,

4883
02:18:47,350 --> 02:18:50,140
if I told you if I told you right now,

4884
02:18:50,141 --> 02:18:51,760
logical method of measurement.

4885
02:18:51,820 --> 02:18:52,540
Yeah.

4886
02:18:52,540 --> 02:18:53,570
Like yeah.

4887
02:18:53,620 --> 02:18:55,600
Like you figured someone figured that out.

4888
02:18:55,630 --> 02:18:55,811
Well,

4889
02:18:55,811 --> 02:18:56,081
no,

4890
02:18:56,081 --> 02:18:59,110
I just assumed that if there's a bunch
of guys that are trying to figure out how

4891
02:18:59,111 --> 02:19:01,310
to get to the moon and back Marza back,

4892
02:19:01,330 --> 02:19:03,730
and I said of these rovers around
that are shooting video back.

4893
02:19:03,850 --> 02:19:05,020
They know how many miles it is.

4894
02:19:05,050 --> 02:19:05,840
Yeah.

4895
02:19:05,840 --> 02:19:06,970
They've got it figured out.

4896
02:19:07,510 --> 02:19:09,370
I just don't know what
the method they use.

4897
02:19:09,371 --> 02:19:10,540
Someone figured it out.

4898
02:19:10,570 --> 02:19:11,530
You don't know the guy's name.

4899
02:19:12,040 --> 02:19:15,490
There's names of experiments like you
could actually look in and you look at,

4900
02:19:15,640 --> 02:19:18,730
there was an experiment called
the Michelson Morley experiment.

4901
02:19:18,910 --> 02:19:21,040
They tried to prove that
the earth was moving.

4902
02:19:21,160 --> 02:19:21,790
So the,

4903
02:19:21,790 --> 02:19:22,241
so they,

4904
02:19:22,241 --> 02:19:22,700
uh,

4905
02:19:22,700 --> 02:19:23,230
they,

4906
02:19:23,230 --> 02:19:27,560
they assumed that the space
is filled with an ether.

4907
02:19:27,620 --> 02:19:29,870
Like that's what dark
matter maybe is dark energy.

4908
02:19:29,990 --> 02:19:30,823
There's an ether.

4909
02:19:30,890 --> 02:19:32,240
So it's like measure,

4910
02:19:32,740 --> 02:19:32,990
uh,

4911
02:19:32,990 --> 02:19:37,700
the light waves going through
the ether as it hits the Earth.

4912
02:19:37,701 --> 02:19:41,780
And then we'll measure it back and we'll
be able to tell if there's an ether

4913
02:19:41,781 --> 02:19:45,080
based on the light
going against the ether.

4914
02:19:45,170 --> 02:19:45,950
And with the code,

4915
02:19:45,950 --> 02:19:48,380
it's like you're swimming
relative to the ground.

4916
02:19:48,560 --> 02:19:48,741
You know,

4917
02:19:48,741 --> 02:19:49,910
they're swimming against the current,

4918
02:19:49,970 --> 02:19:52,970
you go one way and you're
going a certain speed,

4919
02:19:53,030 --> 02:19:54,920
but if you go along the
court or the other way,

4920
02:19:54,921 --> 02:19:55,880
you're going away faster.

4921
02:19:56,060 --> 02:19:56,661
It's like that,

4922
02:19:56,661 --> 02:19:57,800
but they couldn't measure shit.

4923
02:19:57,801 --> 02:19:58,550
When you look in,

4924
02:19:58,550 --> 02:20:00,680
when you look in the
Michelson Morley experiment,

4925
02:20:01,030 --> 02:20:02,330
the results were,

4926
02:20:02,900 --> 02:20:05,780
we couldn't measure that
we're moving at all.

4927
02:20:05,810 --> 02:20:07,280
So it's always been a debate.

4928
02:20:07,340 --> 02:20:08,600
Are we moving?

4929
02:20:08,810 --> 02:20:09,800
Are we moving?

4930
02:20:09,860 --> 02:20:11,060
Even with Einstein,

4931
02:20:11,061 --> 02:20:14,150
it was a debate did like
in the fucking 20s and 30s,

4932
02:20:14,300 --> 02:20:15,740
they still didn't know.

4933
02:20:15,860 --> 02:20:16,693
You assume.

4934
02:20:16,820 --> 02:20:17,151
Yeah,

4935
02:20:17,151 --> 02:20:17,870
it's moving.

4936
02:20:17,870 --> 02:20:20,120
It says right here at
thousand miles an hour.

4937
02:20:20,300 --> 02:20:21,290
It's rotating.

4938
02:20:21,500 --> 02:20:22,070
But they,

4939
02:20:22,070 --> 02:20:24,470
the people at the top don't even know.

4940
02:20:24,650 --> 02:20:25,483
They don't even know.

4941
02:20:25,550 --> 02:20:28,790
But we assumed because we read
it somewhere that they know.

4942
02:20:28,940 --> 02:20:30,110
But it's all guesswork.

4943
02:20:30,200 --> 02:20:30,561
When you,

4944
02:20:30,561 --> 02:20:31,700
when you watch this documentary,

4945
02:20:31,940 --> 02:20:33,290
I'm just repeating shit dude.

4946
02:20:33,560 --> 02:20:33,710
You,

4947
02:20:33,710 --> 02:20:34,543
when you watch this,

4948
02:20:34,580 --> 02:20:35,500
they're all sand.

4949
02:20:35,760 --> 02:20:37,040
It's we're studying.

4950
02:20:37,920 --> 02:20:38,960
This is what they found.

4951
02:20:38,961 --> 02:20:40,460
What they found in the cosmic background.

4952
02:20:40,520 --> 02:20:45,520
They took one reading in 2006 and one
in 2013 and the one in 2006 this is what

4953
02:20:46,191 --> 02:20:47,030
the documentary is about.

4954
02:20:47,030 --> 02:20:49,610
All the signs were talking
about it is they took a picture.

4955
02:20:49,611 --> 02:20:51,590
It's called the cosmic
microwave background.

4956
02:20:51,680 --> 02:20:56,680
It's a picture of all the galaxies through
all the way around you and they took

4957
02:20:56,721 --> 02:20:57,111
a picture.

4958
02:20:57,111 --> 02:20:59,480
They did it in 2006 it's not a conspiracy.

4959
02:20:59,690 --> 02:21:01,880
This is a science documentary
that I'm talking about.

4960
02:21:02,030 --> 02:21:03,830
I'm not talking about conspiracy theory.

4961
02:21:03,831 --> 02:21:05,770
Documentary is a science
doc and there aren't.

4962
02:21:05,780 --> 02:21:08,600
Michio Kaku was talking
about the principle,

4963
02:21:09,110 --> 02:21:09,561
the principle.

4964
02:21:09,561 --> 02:21:12,320
It's called the Copernicus
principal and what they found,

4965
02:21:12,380 --> 02:21:14,930
this is what they found
and in the first reading,

4966
02:21:14,931 --> 02:21:16,250
and they thought there must be a mistake.

4967
02:21:16,310 --> 02:21:20,120
There must be a space until
2013 the European Space Ng,

4968
02:21:20,180 --> 02:21:21,590
they found the same thing and this,

4969
02:21:21,591 --> 02:21:24,220
this is what right now cosmology it.

4970
02:21:24,240 --> 02:21:25,280
They don't know what the fuck to do.

4971
02:21:25,570 --> 02:21:29,900
You know what they found out that
cosmic microwave background shows?

4972
02:21:30,260 --> 02:21:35,260
Did all of the galaxies are on shelves
lined up to us that we are this,

4973
02:21:36,860 --> 02:21:38,450
we're at the fucking center.

4974
02:21:38,600 --> 02:21:39,690
They don't know what to think about.

4975
02:21:40,940 --> 02:21:42,230
That's what the documentary is about.

4976
02:21:42,410 --> 02:21:43,243
This is a rate,

4977
02:21:43,430 --> 02:21:44,190
pull this down.

4978
02:21:44,190 --> 02:21:46,010
So this is a recent documentary.

4979
02:21:46,011 --> 02:21:48,590
There's a lot of controversy
going on about it,

4980
02:21:50,020 --> 02:21:50,601
but who is it?

4981
02:21:50,601 --> 02:21:52,700
The thinks that the
universe is in shelves.

4982
02:21:53,300 --> 02:21:54,450
That's what they're analyzing.

4983
02:21:54,460 --> 02:21:54,940
They're going,

4984
02:21:54,940 --> 02:21:58,160
they're looking at heat in space.

4985
02:21:58,220 --> 02:21:58,971
That's what they're looking to.

4986
02:21:58,971 --> 02:22:00,650
Just heat and all the heat.

4987
02:22:00,860 --> 02:22:05,540
All the heat is all lined up like
in shelves and it's all surround.

4988
02:22:05,630 --> 02:22:06,560
They don't know what to think.

4989
02:22:06,561 --> 02:22:09,650
That's what this documentary
is about is in 2006 they go,

4990
02:22:09,651 --> 02:22:09,951
okay,

4991
02:22:09,951 --> 02:22:10,970
but that must be a mistake.

4992
02:22:11,060 --> 02:22:12,020
That must be a mistake.

4993
02:22:12,110 --> 02:22:16,070
So they didn't do it again until
2013 European space agency in Paris.

4994
02:22:16,280 --> 02:22:18,020
They had fucking press
conference about it.

4995
02:22:18,260 --> 02:22:18,800
They,

4996
02:22:18,800 --> 02:22:20,420
it was the exact same thing.

4997
02:22:20,510 --> 02:22:21,800
So they don't know what
to think right now.

4998
02:22:21,801 --> 02:22:23,060
Right now cosmology is like,

4999
02:22:23,180 --> 02:22:24,200
if that's true,

5000
02:22:24,260 --> 02:22:27,600
if we are the center of the universe,

5001
02:22:27,960 --> 02:22:31,050
that means everything that
we've ever taught her ever,

5002
02:22:31,110 --> 02:22:31,351
ever,

5003
02:22:31,351 --> 02:22:32,610
ever new is all wrong.

5004
02:22:32,940 --> 02:22:34,020
So that's where they're at,

5005
02:22:34,021 --> 02:22:34,171
right?

5006
02:22:34,171 --> 02:22:35,310
That's what the documentary is about.

5007
02:22:35,580 --> 02:22:39,060
I don't know if it's true that cosmic
microwave background could be total

5008
02:22:39,090 --> 02:22:39,923
bullshit.

5009
02:22:39,930 --> 02:22:42,750
That could easily be like
a mind game in itself.

5010
02:22:42,780 --> 02:22:44,160
Like they don't know
what the fuck that is.

5011
02:22:44,490 --> 02:22:45,330
What you find out

5012
02:22:45,490 --> 02:22:48,370
got assumed that the top
astronomers know what the fuck.

5013
02:22:48,400 --> 02:22:49,030
Yes.

5014
02:22:49,030 --> 02:22:50,080
So either way,

5015
02:22:50,170 --> 02:22:50,561
either way,

5016
02:22:50,561 --> 02:22:50,980
it's crazy.

5017
02:22:50,980 --> 02:22:53,980
Constantly updating what
they know to be true.

5018
02:22:54,220 --> 02:22:55,750
So it's not like something that's rigid.

5019
02:22:56,080 --> 02:22:58,360
Like astronomy is one of those things.

5020
02:22:58,361 --> 02:22:59,194
It's like they all,

5021
02:22:59,240 --> 02:23:00,340
they all release.

5022
02:23:00,580 --> 02:23:02,980
See every time they
find out something new,

5023
02:23:03,010 --> 02:23:05,170
every time they find out
something new about a planet,

5024
02:23:05,400 --> 02:23:07,330
like it's important to
release that information.

5025
02:23:07,331 --> 02:23:11,060
It's not like they have like a strict
narrative that they have to hold on to.

5026
02:23:11,380 --> 02:23:13,180
So if someone comes around and says,

5027
02:23:13,420 --> 02:23:18,010
it turns out that our measurement
was inaccurate and the moon is,

5028
02:23:18,011 --> 02:23:18,730
you know,

5029
02:23:18,730 --> 02:23:23,590
x amount of miles further and weighs x
amount of tons less than we thought it

5030
02:23:23,591 --> 02:23:24,670
did or more,

5031
02:23:25,120 --> 02:23:27,310
you don't really think that
would be a bad thing for science.

5032
02:23:27,311 --> 02:23:27,700
Right.

5033
02:23:27,700 --> 02:23:28,091
That was new.

5034
02:23:28,091 --> 02:23:30,040
Just a new discovery
with better equipment.

5035
02:23:30,750 --> 02:23:31,860
But the new discovery,

5036
02:23:31,910 --> 02:23:32,400
wonder what,

5037
02:23:32,400 --> 02:23:33,150
go ahead.

5038
02:23:33,150 --> 02:23:33,983
Interviewed on the,

5039
02:23:34,020 --> 02:23:37,610
according to the Wikipedia for this
documentary claimed that they weren't told

5040
02:23:37,611 --> 02:23:39,550
what they were being
interviewed for and meet you.

5041
02:23:39,551 --> 02:23:43,430
A caucus said that this was likely
clever editing and that whole shipments

5042
02:23:43,460 --> 02:23:45,070
bordered on fresh honesty.

5043
02:23:45,740 --> 02:23:47,660
George Ellis has said that
I was interviewed for it,

5044
02:23:47,661 --> 02:23:49,220
but they did not disclose this agenda,

5045
02:23:49,221 --> 02:23:50,780
which of course is nonsense.

5046
02:23:51,170 --> 02:23:54,110
I don't think it was worth responding
to and he goes on to talk more about it.

5047
02:23:54,410 --> 02:23:58,070
There was counter claims just that
this is all little false hope.

5048
02:23:58,150 --> 02:23:58,391
Yeah.

5049
02:23:58,391 --> 02:24:00,160
There's controversy going on man.

5050
02:24:00,370 --> 02:24:01,690
So the guy who produced it,

5051
02:24:01,880 --> 02:24:03,040
the guy who produced it,

5052
02:24:03,370 --> 02:24:04,270
the guy who produced it,

5053
02:24:04,570 --> 02:24:06,280
he put put out interview.

5054
02:24:06,440 --> 02:24:07,920
Like there's people

5055
02:24:07,970 --> 02:24:09,110
that are getting pressured.

5056
02:24:09,140 --> 02:24:09,650
I don't know.

5057
02:24:09,650 --> 02:24:10,640
This is what they're saying.

5058
02:24:10,820 --> 02:24:11,810
This could all be bullshit.

5059
02:24:11,830 --> 02:24:11,981
Yeah,

5060
02:24:11,981 --> 02:24:13,010
but then also be bullshit.

5061
02:24:13,150 --> 02:24:13,451
Those,

5062
02:24:13,451 --> 02:24:15,860
those documentaries case so juiced up.

5063
02:24:15,920 --> 02:24:16,520
They're so,

5064
02:24:16,520 --> 02:24:17,420
they're so juicy.

5065
02:24:17,480 --> 02:24:18,410
They seem so good.

5066
02:24:18,800 --> 02:24:19,670
They seem so real.

5067
02:24:19,671 --> 02:24:22,220
You get fired up and then
once you get fired up,

5068
02:24:22,250 --> 02:24:23,690
it's tough to get unfired up.

5069
02:24:24,560 --> 02:24:26,780
Cosmic microwave background
could be total bullshit.

5070
02:24:26,800 --> 02:24:27,950
You don't want to be total bullshit.

5071
02:24:27,980 --> 02:24:29,390
I've read really recently.

5072
02:24:29,640 --> 02:24:29,890
Okay.

5073
02:24:29,890 --> 02:24:34,890
You believe that there's been some debate
as to whether or not it's an eternal

5074
02:24:35,151 --> 02:24:35,984
process,

5075
02:24:36,440 --> 02:24:40,130
that there was no beginning or end to
the universe in that what you're seeing

5076
02:24:40,131 --> 02:24:42,980
when you're seeing a big
bang is not the beginning.

5077
02:24:43,040 --> 02:24:44,480
It's just that beginning.

5078
02:24:44,570 --> 02:24:46,160
It's all theories.

5079
02:24:46,161 --> 02:24:47,370
When you watch this documentary,

5080
02:24:47,420 --> 02:24:48,253
you're like,

5081
02:24:48,290 --> 02:24:49,940
they don't know shit.

5082
02:24:49,970 --> 02:24:50,151
Well,

5083
02:24:50,151 --> 02:24:50,961
they know a lot,

5084
02:24:50,961 --> 02:24:52,700
but they definitely don't know everything.

5085
02:24:53,020 --> 02:24:53,690
Lights,

5086
02:24:53,690 --> 02:24:54,800
that's all they're looking at.

5087
02:24:54,860 --> 02:24:57,230
They're not looking at mass or anything.

5088
02:24:57,270 --> 02:24:57,450
Well,

5089
02:24:57,450 --> 02:24:58,283
there's some things.

5090
02:24:58,310 --> 02:25:03,310
They're measuring the galaxy
because the red light is elongated.

5091
02:25:03,620 --> 02:25:03,880
They,

5092
02:25:03,880 --> 02:25:08,880
that's a galaxy and it's 700
trillion light years away.

5093
02:25:09,320 --> 02:25:11,360
How the fuck it sounds,

5094
02:25:11,630 --> 02:25:15,680
it sounds like there's a
lotta bullshit with cosmology.

5095
02:25:15,800 --> 02:25:17,030
They're telling you this.

5096
02:25:17,150 --> 02:25:21,260
They're telling you who is day though
as scientists and Mitchell Kako,

5097
02:25:21,261 --> 02:25:22,094
he'll tell us,

5098
02:25:22,700 --> 02:25:23,290
uh,

5099
02:25:23,290 --> 02:25:23,620
um,

5100
02:25:23,620 --> 02:25:25,180
the Kapernick is principal.

5101
02:25:25,181 --> 02:25:26,800
The one that we live by is the,

5102
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:28,240
were insignificant.

5103
02:25:28,510 --> 02:25:29,620
We mean nothing.

5104
02:25:29,650 --> 02:25:33,640
We're a speck in the universe and
then there's a geocentric model.

5105
02:25:33,670 --> 02:25:36,460
That's the heliocentric model
that we go around the sun.

5106
02:25:36,610 --> 02:25:39,910
The geocentric model means
that everything goes around us.

5107
02:25:40,090 --> 02:25:41,350
That's what this says in the Bible.

5108
02:25:41,410 --> 02:25:43,180
That's what the first
astronomers were saying.

5109
02:25:43,360 --> 02:25:43,830
Uh,

5110
02:25:43,830 --> 02:25:44,190
um,

5111
02:25:44,190 --> 02:25:45,520
taller may was the first one said,

5112
02:25:45,521 --> 02:25:45,671
yeah,

5113
02:25:45,671 --> 02:25:46,504
we are the center.

5114
02:25:46,600 --> 02:25:49,000
You can tell based on
his own observations,

5115
02:25:49,650 --> 02:25:51,640
everything is revolving around us.

5116
02:25:51,970 --> 02:25:53,350
And then other people came by.

5117
02:25:53,351 --> 02:25:54,184
Copernicus said,

5118
02:25:54,220 --> 02:25:54,570
HAH,

5119
02:25:54,570 --> 02:25:55,403
no,

5120
02:25:55,450 --> 02:25:57,340
based on these observations,

5121
02:25:57,400 --> 02:25:58,270
this could also work.

5122
02:25:58,360 --> 02:25:59,710
The Sun's going around.

5123
02:25:59,890 --> 02:26:00,011
Oh,

5124
02:26:00,011 --> 02:26:01,240
we're going around the sun.

5125
02:26:01,241 --> 02:26:01,410
And,

5126
02:26:01,410 --> 02:26:04,840
and then there was a third one where
we're the center of the sun's going around

5127
02:26:04,860 --> 02:26:05,021
us,

5128
02:26:05,021 --> 02:26:06,640
but the planets are going around the sun.

5129
02:26:06,790 --> 02:26:09,910
There was three models and they
were all based on observations.

5130
02:26:09,911 --> 02:26:11,410
Like dude's just looking at lights,

5131
02:26:11,710 --> 02:26:12,380
they're looking at light,

5132
02:26:12,380 --> 02:26:13,300
sort of figure out,

5133
02:26:13,510 --> 02:26:14,110
okay,

5134
02:26:14,110 --> 02:26:17,380
are we going around the sun
or the sun going around us?

5135
02:26:17,620 --> 02:26:18,011
You know?

5136
02:26:18,011 --> 02:26:18,990
And um,

5137
02:26:19,090 --> 02:26:23,080
even like Einstein's times he has a
quote saying that we don't have the

5138
02:26:23,081 --> 02:26:28,081
technology to even prove that
the earth is even spinning.

5139
02:26:28,360 --> 02:26:28,930
They can't even,

5140
02:26:28,930 --> 02:26:30,220
there's still a debate.

5141
02:26:30,340 --> 02:26:31,700
Are we even moving?

5142
02:26:31,720 --> 02:26:32,560
Are we still,

5143
02:26:32,680 --> 02:26:33,461
do we have to move?

5144
02:26:33,461 --> 02:26:35,710
Because apparently the
moon doesn't spend it.

5145
02:26:35,711 --> 02:26:36,460
It's still,

5146
02:26:36,460 --> 02:26:37,293
why wouldn't,

5147
02:26:37,330 --> 02:26:39,070
why is it so hard to
believe that we're still,

5148
02:26:39,071 --> 02:26:42,670
because they haven't even improve
even at it since Einstein.

5149
02:26:43,020 --> 02:26:43,320
Oh No,

5150
02:26:43,320 --> 02:26:44,460
maybe they did prove it.

5151
02:26:44,461 --> 02:26:48,480
Earth is the center of the universe and
we stand still and the universe spins

5152
02:26:48,481 --> 02:26:50,220
around us 24 hours a day.

5153
02:26:51,360 --> 02:26:52,193
Wouldn't,

5154
02:26:52,530 --> 02:26:54,780
wouldn't that be not to think
they're measuring that though.

5155
02:26:54,870 --> 02:26:56,190
And I think that's what they're saying.

5156
02:26:56,200 --> 02:26:56,950
The copper,

5157
02:26:56,950 --> 02:26:59,820
I feel them emailing me right now
and tell her to go fuck myself.

5158
02:27:00,690 --> 02:27:04,800
This is a disrespectful conversation that
files that could be totally bullshit,

5159
02:27:04,830 --> 02:27:06,060
but we need to get near the grass.

5160
02:27:06,061 --> 02:27:06,894
Tyson,

5161
02:27:07,500 --> 02:27:08,400
Eddie Bravo.

5162
02:27:08,690 --> 02:27:08,881
Yeah,

5163
02:27:08,881 --> 02:27:09,750
that's what they're saying.

5164
02:27:10,080 --> 02:27:10,381
Yeah.

5165
02:27:10,381 --> 02:27:13,050
I don't know who the fuck is
they and I don't know what this,

5166
02:27:13,051 --> 02:27:14,320
I have to watch this documentary.

5167
02:27:14,700 --> 02:27:16,530
Michio Kaku news all about it.

5168
02:27:16,531 --> 02:27:17,364
He's in it,

5169
02:27:17,550 --> 02:27:18,240
he's in it,

5170
02:27:18,240 --> 02:27:19,430
and then there are the fuckers,

5171
02:27:19,431 --> 02:27:20,101
the conspiracy,

5172
02:27:20,101 --> 02:27:20,934
but everything,

5173
02:27:21,230 --> 02:27:22,200
if that's true,

5174
02:27:22,410 --> 02:27:24,030
all the Shit we've
learned about scientists,

5175
02:27:24,060 --> 02:27:24,660
trash,

5176
02:27:24,660 --> 02:27:25,201
everything.

5177
02:27:25,201 --> 02:27:27,900
Even Einstein's theory of relativity,

5178
02:27:28,140 --> 02:27:29,040
if this is true,

5179
02:27:29,190 --> 02:27:30,090
that goes down,

5180
02:27:30,300 --> 02:27:32,310
that Copernicus principle goes down,

5181
02:27:32,370 --> 02:27:34,050
everything goes down about space.

5182
02:27:34,050 --> 02:27:37,440
Everything hazard comes back or the
rebel flag on the roof of the car.

5183
02:27:37,441 --> 02:27:38,940
The world is up and down.

5184
02:27:38,941 --> 02:27:40,410
Cats and dogs living together.

5185
02:27:41,580 --> 02:27:42,031
Don't you think?

5186
02:27:42,031 --> 02:27:46,380
It's weird that we spin and the water
doesn't fall off the plant somehow

5187
02:27:46,381 --> 02:27:47,610
magically it gravity.

5188
02:27:47,611 --> 02:27:49,650
It's just that we dealing with mass on it.

5189
02:27:49,651 --> 02:27:52,380
It's such a grand scale that
even though it's circular,

5190
02:27:52,560 --> 02:27:57,560
like what we think of as being flat
is just our inability to grasp the

5191
02:27:57,751 --> 02:28:02,250
perspective of a 24,000
miles circumference.

5192
02:28:02,460 --> 02:28:03,060
Oh,

5193
02:28:03,060 --> 02:28:03,893
okay.

5194
02:28:04,950 --> 02:28:05,880
You don't believe that?

5195
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:06,630
I don't know.

5196
02:28:06,630 --> 02:28:07,220
I mean,

5197
02:28:07,220 --> 02:28:08,770
I haven't done experiments on it.

5198
02:28:09,330 --> 02:28:11,400
You don't have to know
other people did it?

5199
02:28:11,520 --> 02:28:11,880
Yeah.

5200
02:28:11,880 --> 02:28:15,480
Read what the scientists
believe Shit other people done.

5201
02:28:15,570 --> 02:28:18,000
I don't believe any of the loving
people you two videos that are not.

5202
02:28:18,020 --> 02:28:18,660
I believe that.

5203
02:28:18,660 --> 02:28:19,920
I believe people talking when I,

5204
02:28:19,980 --> 02:28:23,450
when I see their video as they're
talking like it's a physicist and he's

5205
02:28:23,451 --> 02:28:23,901
talking,

5206
02:28:23,901 --> 02:28:24,530
I like,

5207
02:28:24,530 --> 02:28:25,490
I liked that kind of shit.

5208
02:28:25,640 --> 02:28:26,540
Anything that's written,

5209
02:28:26,541 --> 02:28:28,350
like anybody could have
wrote whatever I want,

5210
02:28:28,420 --> 02:28:29,660
I need to see interviews.

5211
02:28:29,690 --> 02:28:30,523
I understand.

5212
02:28:30,920 --> 02:28:31,790
Watch the principal,

5213
02:28:31,791 --> 02:28:32,810
your fucking mind will melt.

5214
02:28:32,840 --> 02:28:34,430
This is not a conspiracy theory of video.

5215
02:28:34,610 --> 02:28:36,890
This is a sudden be a bullshit video.

5216
02:28:36,891 --> 02:28:39,560
Because what Jamie was saying was these
people that were in it were saying they

5217
02:28:39,561 --> 02:28:42,440
were edited out of context and they didn't
know the true intention of the movie.

5218
02:28:42,800 --> 02:28:43,251
I don't know.

5219
02:28:43,251 --> 02:28:43,731
You know,

5220
02:28:43,731 --> 02:28:44,564
cause you seed it.

5221
02:28:44,900 --> 02:28:47,420
I'm just parroting when he's just talking,

5222
02:28:47,421 --> 02:28:49,400
we're just talking about [inaudible].

5223
02:28:49,670 --> 02:28:50,450
What do you think about Dick?

5224
02:28:50,450 --> 02:28:51,320
I'm not really into it.

5225
02:28:52,190 --> 02:28:52,800
Cut To,

5226
02:28:52,800 --> 02:28:54,020
what do you think about space?

5227
02:28:54,021 --> 02:28:54,854
I'm not really into it.

5228
02:28:56,960 --> 02:28:57,793
It's not my thing.

5229
02:28:57,860 --> 02:28:58,461
It's not your thing.

5230
02:28:58,461 --> 02:28:58,551
Well,

5231
02:28:58,551 --> 02:28:59,384
how'd you get this job?

5232
02:28:59,470 --> 02:29:00,350
It's probably,

5233
02:29:00,351 --> 02:29:00,681
well,

5234
02:29:00,681 --> 02:29:02,390
I went to school at the
University of Arizona.

5235
02:29:02,391 --> 02:29:02,900
You know what I mean?

5236
02:29:02,900 --> 02:29:03,990
They have this like yeah,

5237
02:29:04,160 --> 02:29:05,150
it's probably bullshit.

5238
02:29:05,151 --> 02:29:06,110
But what you learned from that,

5239
02:29:06,111 --> 02:29:08,780
whether it's true or not about
the cosmic microwave background,

5240
02:29:08,990 --> 02:29:09,823
whether we're rolling,

5241
02:29:09,830 --> 02:29:11,650
whether the universe
is rotating around us,

5242
02:29:11,930 --> 02:29:13,160
it doesn't mean it doesn't mean shit.

5243
02:29:13,161 --> 02:29:17,330
What you learn is there so many different
points of views and everything is just

5244
02:29:17,331 --> 02:29:21,200
a theory and you learned that they still
haven't figured a lot of shit out that

5245
02:29:21,201 --> 02:29:22,820
we think people will figure it out,

5246
02:29:22,940 --> 02:29:24,830
but they actually didn't figure out.

5247
02:29:24,950 --> 02:29:26,150
They still haven't figured out.

5248
02:29:26,210 --> 02:29:26,540
They're like,

5249
02:29:26,540 --> 02:29:26,811
yeah,

5250
02:29:26,811 --> 02:29:27,770
the earth spins.

5251
02:29:27,860 --> 02:29:30,020
We have a pendulum that fucking approves.

5252
02:29:30,230 --> 02:29:31,220
If you see a pendulum,

5253
02:29:31,340 --> 02:29:35,280
you prove that it proves that it
spins like really a fucking Pendleton.

5254
02:29:35,380 --> 02:29:35,691
He don't.

5255
02:29:35,691 --> 02:29:37,970
You think this is something that you
should probably really know what you're

5256
02:29:37,971 --> 02:29:39,830
talking about before you
go on these long rants?

5257
02:29:39,831 --> 02:29:42,320
Cause I don't know what I'm talking about.

5258
02:29:42,321 --> 02:29:43,300
The show stone or tile.

5259
02:29:43,310 --> 02:29:43,581
I know.

5260
02:29:43,581 --> 02:29:44,630
I don't know what I'm talking about,

5261
02:29:44,631 --> 02:29:46,700
but what scientists we're funding.

5262
02:29:47,580 --> 02:29:49,730
It doesn't take an idiot to fit.

5263
02:29:51,950 --> 02:29:52,783
Oh my God.

5264
02:29:53,080 --> 02:29:53,250
No,

5265
02:29:53,250 --> 02:29:53,451
no,

5266
02:29:53,451 --> 02:29:53,661
no,

5267
02:29:53,661 --> 02:29:53,841
no.

5268
02:29:53,841 --> 02:29:54,401
It's just this,

5269
02:29:54,401 --> 02:29:54,621
this,

5270
02:29:54,621 --> 02:29:55,790
this is not something we should,

5271
02:29:56,000 --> 02:30:01,000
this is like some really dumb dudes who
have head injuries talking about jet Lee

5272
02:30:01,251 --> 02:30:01,850
movies.

5273
02:30:01,850 --> 02:30:02,683
Turn it Hollywood,

5274
02:30:02,690 --> 02:30:03,590
use that shit.

5275
02:30:03,620 --> 02:30:04,400
Turn it off.

5276
02:30:04,400 --> 02:30:06,170
That's how they use
that shot on the street.

5277
02:30:06,410 --> 02:30:07,630
You don't mean that's fascinating.

5278
02:30:08,130 --> 02:30:08,961
If it's real,

5279
02:30:08,961 --> 02:30:09,711
it's fascinating,

5280
02:30:09,711 --> 02:30:10,140
right?

5281
02:30:10,140 --> 02:30:10,701
It's real.

5282
02:30:10,701 --> 02:30:11,570
It's life changing.

5283
02:30:11,630 --> 02:30:12,463
Yeah.

5284
02:30:12,860 --> 02:30:13,520
If it's rules,

5285
02:30:13,520 --> 02:30:15,920
guys who were in it and say they
were tricked a lot of things,

5286
02:30:16,820 --> 02:30:17,630
I have to watch it.

5287
02:30:17,630 --> 02:30:19,310
You got to watch why they
said they were trick.

5288
02:30:19,311 --> 02:30:19,761
There's a reason.

5289
02:30:19,761 --> 02:30:20,340
There's reasons.

5290
02:30:20,340 --> 02:30:21,950
I don't want to admit they changes.

5291
02:30:21,951 --> 02:30:24,770
Everything did it crushes
it crushes their careers,

5292
02:30:24,800 --> 02:30:26,510
but why does it even
have to be conspiracy?

5293
02:30:26,511 --> 02:30:27,730
Like if you just look at what,

5294
02:30:27,810 --> 02:30:29,960
what is absolute about space?

5295
02:30:30,110 --> 02:30:31,400
Forget about all the measurements.

5296
02:30:31,640 --> 02:30:33,460
Like forget about all the
numbers because we don't really,

5297
02:30:33,560 --> 02:30:34,650
I don't know and you don't know.

5298
02:30:34,970 --> 02:30:35,900
Just forget about that.

5299
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:39,380
Just just like what they're
figuring out right now about Mars.

5300
02:30:39,550 --> 02:30:42,190
I mean that they're sending back these
images from this rovers and these

5301
02:30:42,191 --> 02:30:44,300
scientists are debating what this is,

5302
02:30:44,301 --> 02:30:44,931
what that is.

5303
02:30:44,931 --> 02:30:47,330
If this is actual running
water at one point in time,

5304
02:30:47,331 --> 02:30:48,590
if this is some sort of a strange,

5305
02:30:48,860 --> 02:30:52,280
all that for sure is really
happening 100% that's all bullshit.

5306
02:30:52,490 --> 02:30:53,690
You don't think they're really unmarked?

5307
02:30:53,740 --> 02:30:54,573
They're faking everything.

5308
02:30:55,280 --> 02:30:56,290
I think they're faking everything.

5309
02:30:57,170 --> 02:30:58,070
I think all that's fake.

5310
02:30:58,100 --> 02:30:58,980
You don't think they,

5311
02:30:58,981 --> 02:31:01,190
they landed on Mars with a rover fake.

5312
02:31:01,310 --> 02:31:02,143
How come?

5313
02:31:02,190 --> 02:31:03,050
It's just too hard.

5314
02:31:03,290 --> 02:31:04,123
It's too hard to do.

5315
02:31:04,760 --> 02:31:05,270
They got to,

5316
02:31:05,270 --> 02:31:05,631
you know what?

5317
02:31:05,631 --> 02:31:06,620
They've lied so much.

5318
02:31:06,621 --> 02:31:09,510
NASA slides so goddamn much
that I don't believe she,

5319
02:31:09,530 --> 02:31:09,830
I see.

5320
02:31:09,830 --> 02:31:10,663
I believe.

5321
02:31:11,480 --> 02:31:15,350
I believe for sure they have shot rockets
into space because we can watch it

5322
02:31:15,351 --> 02:31:19,650
happen and also for sure people died
when they've launched those rockets into

5323
02:31:19,651 --> 02:31:20,484
space.

5324
02:31:20,610 --> 02:31:25,260
But they definitely have a way to
move rovers around on Mars now.

5325
02:31:25,320 --> 02:31:25,890
It's not a,

5326
02:31:25,890 --> 02:31:27,630
it's not a biological impediment.

5327
02:31:27,660 --> 02:31:29,280
It's not like they have to keep people,

5328
02:31:29,281 --> 02:31:31,110
like they're saying if they're
going to fly people out there,

5329
02:31:31,111 --> 02:31:34,800
it's going to take six months and you
know they have to have enough food to stay

5330
02:31:34,801 --> 02:31:37,290
alive and air and whatever the fuck it,

5331
02:31:37,291 --> 02:31:39,930
they have to make sure they don't get hit
by micro meteors and they going to put

5332
02:31:39,931 --> 02:31:41,190
them on the surface of Mars.

5333
02:31:41,970 --> 02:31:43,740
But that's not a person though.

5334
02:31:43,741 --> 02:31:47,070
You're talking about like a rover and it
looks like fucking Arizona with like a

5335
02:31:47,071 --> 02:31:47,611
red tent.

5336
02:31:47,611 --> 02:31:49,710
We rally cause mom shops like Arizona,

5337
02:31:49,711 --> 02:31:50,420
but we were ready.

5338
02:31:50,420 --> 02:31:50,701
Shit,

5339
02:31:50,701 --> 02:31:51,300
come on.

5340
02:31:51,300 --> 02:31:52,140
I think it's all bull.

5341
02:31:52,950 --> 02:31:53,783
I don't believe anything.

5342
02:31:53,970 --> 02:31:54,331
Well you know,

5343
02:31:54,331 --> 02:31:57,720
there's nothing on Mars
that doesn't exist on earth.

5344
02:31:57,950 --> 02:31:58,783
That's what they say.

5345
02:31:59,240 --> 02:31:59,820
All the mean,

5346
02:31:59,820 --> 02:32:00,360
isn't that,

5347
02:32:00,360 --> 02:32:01,193
isn't that correct?

5348
02:32:01,230 --> 02:32:04,950
As far as like the minerals that they're
finding in the soil or the kind of dirt

5349
02:32:04,951 --> 02:32:05,940
that they're experiencing.

5350
02:32:06,540 --> 02:32:06,721
I mean,

5351
02:32:06,721 --> 02:32:09,270
I think it's different in its
appearance and its imagery,

5352
02:32:09,271 --> 02:32:12,810
but it could just be that that's
what is without water look like.

5353
02:32:12,870 --> 02:32:14,150
When you see a real picture of Mars,

5354
02:32:14,151 --> 02:32:15,600
you CEO's A.

5355
02:32:15,600 --> 02:32:15,601
Dot.

5356
02:32:15,601 --> 02:32:16,250
A light.

5357
02:32:16,250 --> 02:32:16,920
Right?

5358
02:32:16,920 --> 02:32:17,521
I understand.

5359
02:32:17,521 --> 02:32:18,600
But that's what we see.

5360
02:32:18,720 --> 02:32:20,820
But like when you're looking at Mars,

5361
02:32:21,090 --> 02:32:21,540
right?

5362
02:32:21,540 --> 02:32:22,800
Or you're looking at the,

5363
02:32:22,810 --> 02:32:25,500
the desert like in Arizona,

5364
02:32:25,560 --> 02:32:26,760
like that crazy desert,

5365
02:32:26,770 --> 02:32:27,421
the Utah,

5366
02:32:27,421 --> 02:32:28,171
Arizona,

5367
02:32:28,171 --> 02:32:29,640
you know those rocks and shit,

5368
02:32:29,641 --> 02:32:30,600
all that crazy desert.

5369
02:32:30,720 --> 02:32:30,931
Oh,

5370
02:32:30,931 --> 02:32:31,470
that looks,

5371
02:32:31,470 --> 02:32:32,700
that might as well be Mars.

5372
02:32:33,100 --> 02:32:33,933
That could be anything.

5373
02:32:34,020 --> 02:32:36,480
If you thought Maurice was
completely different from Earth,

5374
02:32:36,481 --> 02:32:38,040
think again that could be Pomona

5375
02:32:39,840 --> 02:32:40,441
are warm.

5376
02:32:40,441 --> 02:32:43,290
Blue Planet is more similar in some ways.

5377
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:46,290
I the desolate red planathon,

5378
02:32:46,350 --> 02:32:47,183
you know,

5379
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:50,600
and we have comparison
images to prove it at,

5380
02:32:50,610 --> 02:32:51,960
find out about the actual,

5381
02:32:51,961 --> 02:32:52,200
uh,

5382
02:32:52,200 --> 02:32:55,980
minerals in it and see if you can
find like if the soil is significantly

5383
02:32:55,981 --> 02:32:56,814
different.

5384
02:32:56,970 --> 02:32:59,640
I mean the soil varies all
over the place on earth,

5385
02:32:59,641 --> 02:32:59,970
right?

5386
02:32:59,970 --> 02:33:00,450
I mean,

5387
02:33:00,450 --> 02:33:01,350
soils everywhere.

5388
02:33:01,380 --> 02:33:03,030
You don't think there's
a little tiny chance,

5389
02:33:03,031 --> 02:33:04,920
small little percentage that
they can be faking and then,

5390
02:33:04,921 --> 02:33:05,754
no,

5391
02:33:05,880 --> 02:33:06,690
I don't,

5392
02:33:06,690 --> 02:33:07,980
I don't think it's hard to do.

5393
02:33:08,010 --> 02:33:08,221
I mean,

5394
02:33:08,221 --> 02:33:09,210
I think it's hard to do,

5395
02:33:09,211 --> 02:33:10,020
but they've done it.

5396
02:33:10,020 --> 02:33:10,320
Look,

5397
02:33:10,320 --> 02:33:13,020
they've already got all these
crazy satellite images of earth.

5398
02:33:13,290 --> 02:33:16,020
They got satellite images
all the way out to,

5399
02:33:16,021 --> 02:33:16,710
um,

5400
02:33:16,710 --> 02:33:17,910
Jupiter's moons.

5401
02:33:17,940 --> 02:33:20,450
They've got that satellite image of a,

5402
02:33:20,460 --> 02:33:22,020
that frozen moon.

5403
02:33:22,620 --> 02:33:22,981
What's that?

5404
02:33:22,981 --> 02:33:23,820
Frozen Moon.

5405
02:33:24,060 --> 02:33:24,151
Oh,

5406
02:33:24,151 --> 02:33:25,490
let me see if that's CGI.

5407
02:33:25,500 --> 02:33:26,333
Find that Bro.

5408
02:33:26,440 --> 02:33:28,470
We got a picture of a frozen fucking moon.

5409
02:33:28,890 --> 02:33:30,450
I guarantee you it's CGI.

5410
02:33:32,960 --> 02:33:33,720
The frozen,

5411
02:33:33,720 --> 02:33:34,710
the water moon.

5412
02:33:35,010 --> 02:33:35,680
What is it called?

5413
02:33:35,680 --> 02:33:38,340
No way they can take a
picture of a second man.

5414
02:33:38,820 --> 02:33:41,490
What does Mars made of
comparison to Planet Mars?

5415
02:33:41,491 --> 02:33:43,860
Marsh and soil is the fine,

5416
02:33:43,880 --> 02:33:44,091
blah,

5417
02:33:44,091 --> 02:33:44,281
blah,

5418
02:33:44,281 --> 02:33:44,510
blah,

5419
02:33:44,510 --> 02:33:44,761
blah,

5420
02:33:44,761 --> 02:33:46,480
blah on differ,

5421
02:33:46,760 --> 02:33:47,430
uh,

5422
02:33:47,430 --> 02:33:51,480
properties can differ significantly
from those on terrestrial,

5423
02:33:51,630 --> 02:33:52,860
those of terrestrial soil,

5424
02:33:53,160 --> 02:33:57,840
the term Martian soil typically
refers to the fine fraction of re.

5425
02:33:57,900 --> 02:33:58,733
What does that,

5426
02:33:59,160 --> 02:34:00,760
what does that word recall?

5427
02:34:01,110 --> 02:34:01,943
Regolith.

5428
02:34:02,100 --> 02:34:03,300
Regolith on earth.

5429
02:34:03,390 --> 02:34:06,990
The term soil usually
includes organic content.

5430
02:34:07,080 --> 02:34:07,231
Oh,

5431
02:34:07,231 --> 02:34:08,100
that's interesting.

5432
02:34:08,220 --> 02:34:09,810
So because everything's dead,

5433
02:34:10,020 --> 02:34:10,711
it's dirt.

5434
02:34:10,711 --> 02:34:11,700
It's not soil.

5435
02:34:12,090 --> 02:34:12,923
Huh?

5436
02:34:13,710 --> 02:34:14,543
That's interesting.

5437
02:34:14,730 --> 02:34:15,031
Right?

5438
02:34:15,031 --> 02:34:16,800
Like soil is a fucking life form.

5439
02:34:17,290 --> 02:34:17,980
That's what people don't

5440
02:34:17,980 --> 02:34:18,370
think about.

5441
02:34:18,370 --> 02:34:20,380
Have you ever seen one of those
documentaries where they show,

5442
02:34:20,520 --> 02:34:21,160
um,

5443
02:34:21,160 --> 02:34:21,630
the,

5444
02:34:21,630 --> 02:34:21,880
uh,

5445
02:34:21,880 --> 02:34:24,850
interaction between the mycelium and the,

5446
02:34:24,851 --> 02:34:25,031
uh,

5447
02:34:25,031 --> 02:34:27,880
the roots of the trees
and even rocks themselves?

5448
02:34:28,060 --> 02:34:30,250
Like how they have this
sort of crazy relationship?

5449
02:34:30,830 --> 02:34:33,220
Radio lab did this amazing podcast on it.

5450
02:34:33,221 --> 02:34:33,790
Man,

5451
02:34:33,790 --> 02:34:33,971
you know,

5452
02:34:33,971 --> 02:34:35,740
we think of a tree as being like,

5453
02:34:35,741 --> 02:34:36,371
this is a tree.

5454
02:34:36,371 --> 02:34:37,204
It's in the ground,

5455
02:34:37,210 --> 02:34:39,310
it's by itself and there's
another tree over there.

5456
02:34:39,580 --> 02:34:44,580
Now they're all connected like it's some
crazy super highway of give and take.

5457
02:34:44,980 --> 02:34:48,600
They give each other sugars
and minerals and the,

5458
02:34:48,601 --> 02:34:53,380
the mycelium actually cleans to rocks
and pulls minerals out of the rocks and

5459
02:34:53,381 --> 02:34:56,200
they all exist together
in this crazy ecosystem.

5460
02:34:56,530 --> 02:34:58,000
It's an amazing podcast,

5461
02:34:58,001 --> 02:34:58,271
man.

5462
02:34:58,271 --> 02:34:59,080
If you listen to it,

5463
02:34:59,080 --> 02:35:00,310
it's a mind blower.

5464
02:35:00,760 --> 02:35:01,271
It's a,

5465
02:35:01,271 --> 02:35:02,950
it's just how they look and all that out.

5466
02:35:03,310 --> 02:35:05,440
They actually have seen these
things under the microscope.

5467
02:35:05,440 --> 02:35:10,180
They were showing these things that these
things exist in a just a small area.

5468
02:35:10,181 --> 02:35:15,181
You'll find miles and miles of this
like sort of fungus growth and fungus.

5469
02:35:16,301 --> 02:35:20,020
Apparently the week's explained to me
it like when you see like mushrooms,

5470
02:35:20,021 --> 02:35:21,370
mushrooms aren't like a plant.

5471
02:35:21,400 --> 02:35:24,820
They're closer to a person
and the to plant mushrooms,

5472
02:35:24,821 --> 02:35:25,720
breathe air.

5473
02:35:26,650 --> 02:35:27,483
Wait a minute,

5474
02:35:29,170 --> 02:35:32,770
you just said mushrooms are closer to
a person than a plant than they are a

5475
02:35:32,771 --> 02:35:33,604
plant.

5476
02:35:33,880 --> 02:35:35,140
They're more like a life form.

5477
02:35:35,800 --> 02:35:36,740
They're more like they're,

5478
02:35:36,770 --> 02:35:37,930
they're weird man.

5479
02:35:38,450 --> 02:35:40,960
You believe that mushrooms are weird,

5480
02:35:41,140 --> 02:35:42,220
so weird growth.

5481
02:35:42,640 --> 02:35:47,290
It's some sort of a living thing that
doesn't move but they interconnect and

5482
02:35:47,291 --> 02:35:52,000
some strange way with all the plants
around them and become like a highway

5483
02:35:52,001 --> 02:35:52,834
system.

5484
02:35:53,440 --> 02:35:54,280
They even this,

5485
02:35:54,281 --> 02:35:54,551
this,

5486
02:35:54,551 --> 02:35:55,361
this in this,

5487
02:35:55,361 --> 02:35:56,194
um,

5488
02:35:56,290 --> 02:36:00,700
this podcast they were talking about
how they find a tree that's like

5489
02:36:00,701 --> 02:36:04,300
specifically needy and they
channel resources to that tree.

5490
02:36:04,660 --> 02:36:07,690
Like there's like some sort of a way
that these plants are communicating with

5491
02:36:07,691 --> 02:36:08,470
each other.

5492
02:36:08,470 --> 02:36:12,580
They're just struggling to understand
right now they really don't know what the

5493
02:36:12,581 --> 02:36:13,450
fuck they're doing.

5494
02:36:13,990 --> 02:36:18,250
They just know that something is happening
and that we may have looked at plants

5495
02:36:18,370 --> 02:36:22,360
as being these inanimate things or
these things that lie that they live,

5496
02:36:22,361 --> 02:36:25,060
but they don't have any awareness
whatsoever of their surroundings.

5497
02:36:25,360 --> 02:36:28,480
Now they know that they can
play the sound of caterpillars.

5498
02:36:28,481 --> 02:36:31,960
Chewing leaves around plants
and these plants were,

5499
02:36:31,961 --> 02:36:34,540
was release a toxin
that makes their leaves,

5500
02:36:34,541 --> 02:36:37,500
tastes like shit to discourage predation.

5501
02:36:38,700 --> 02:36:40,240
Like Karen's the eight,

5502
02:36:40,270 --> 02:36:41,920
they can get any spray on them.

5503
02:36:41,950 --> 02:36:42,850
They ran out of spray.

5504
02:36:43,300 --> 02:36:43,960
What do you mean?

5505
02:36:43,960 --> 02:36:47,800
The ones that the bugs delete is probably
the ones that pay probably they don't

5506
02:36:47,801 --> 02:36:48,760
spray the old one.

5507
02:36:48,761 --> 02:36:51,280
This is not a re they don't
use real bugs for this.

5508
02:36:51,280 --> 02:36:52,390
They take the sound,

5509
02:36:52,391 --> 02:36:53,380
this is where it's fucked up.

5510
02:36:53,650 --> 02:36:58,650
They take a recording of caterpillar
eating leaves and they make the recording

5511
02:36:59,170 --> 02:37:02,860
go off next to the tree and the tree
starts releasing those chemicals.

5512
02:37:03,010 --> 02:37:04,060
Somehow or another.

5513
02:37:04,420 --> 02:37:09,420
It's taking in the sound
waves cause that's all they
are of a caterpillar eating

5514
02:37:10,511 --> 02:37:12,910
leaves and it's causing the
leaves to become more bitter.

5515
02:37:13,270 --> 02:37:17,600
Eventually there's going to be one plant
that knows its trick and then I'm breed

5516
02:37:17,601 --> 02:37:18,440
and evolve.

5517
02:37:18,890 --> 02:37:20,600
And then you've got to change the systems.

5518
02:37:21,260 --> 02:37:21,920
Well,

5519
02:37:21,920 --> 02:37:22,400
yeah.

5520
02:37:22,400 --> 02:37:23,960
All the animals are gonna Starve to death.

5521
02:37:24,680 --> 02:37:25,241
Like they,

5522
02:37:25,241 --> 02:37:30,080
they've had problems where animals
will eat up stream from other animals.

5523
02:37:30,260 --> 02:37:34,280
So if a bunch of animals are eating
the sound of the animals eating,

5524
02:37:34,281 --> 02:37:37,180
that plant gets into
the system and all the,

5525
02:37:37,181 --> 02:37:40,730
the leaves go bitter and the animals
won't eat the leaves and then they wind up

5526
02:37:40,731 --> 02:37:41,810
getting sick and dying.

5527
02:37:42,040 --> 02:37:42,140
Uh,

5528
02:37:42,140 --> 02:37:43,230
here's where it gets Chepe.

5529
02:37:43,350 --> 02:37:43,621
What,

5530
02:37:43,621 --> 02:37:43,991
what,

5531
02:37:43,991 --> 02:37:46,370
what gets where clappy though the animals,

5532
02:37:46,371 --> 02:37:47,780
they get sick and die
because they don't eat.

5533
02:37:47,781 --> 02:37:51,790
They starve to death because the
plants tastes like she's a plants.

5534
02:37:51,820 --> 02:37:52,653
Tastes like shit.

5535
02:37:53,060 --> 02:37:53,571
Damn.

5536
02:37:53,571 --> 02:37:56,360
There's a war going on that were right
under our nose and we didn't know.

5537
02:37:56,400 --> 02:37:57,920
Here's where it gets really weird.

5538
02:37:58,220 --> 02:38:00,590
That plant that they're talking
about that does all this.

5539
02:38:00,950 --> 02:38:02,210
That's the acacia plant.

5540
02:38:02,630 --> 02:38:06,380
That's the plant that those Jerusalem
scholars think might be DMT.

5541
02:38:06,710 --> 02:38:11,710
It might be what Moses saw when Moses
saw the burning Bush that became God like

5542
02:38:12,231 --> 02:38:12,831
that was God.

5543
02:38:12,831 --> 02:38:13,880
It was communicating with them.

5544
02:38:13,881 --> 02:38:16,610
They think it might be
the Acacia tree cause he,

5545
02:38:16,611 --> 02:38:20,810
Acacia tree is rich in
dimethyltryptamine and the acacia trees.

5546
02:38:20,811 --> 02:38:23,990
The tree that when animals
are eating it upstream,

5547
02:38:24,620 --> 02:38:25,880
the ones downstream,

5548
02:38:26,090 --> 02:38:27,650
they changed their taste.

5549
02:38:28,640 --> 02:38:32,210
They smell it or they hear it or somehow
or another they become aware of through

5550
02:38:32,211 --> 02:38:37,211
the ground that the ones up hill or
getting eaten so they all taste like shit

5551
02:38:37,351 --> 02:38:39,290
and animals start starving to death.

5552
02:38:40,640 --> 02:38:41,010
By the way,

5553
02:38:41,010 --> 02:38:41,390
monitor.

5554
02:38:41,390 --> 02:38:42,530
Some of that may not be true,

5555
02:38:44,090 --> 02:38:46,490
but I believe it is according
to that Radiolab podcast.

5556
02:38:46,491 --> 02:38:47,090
I believe it's true.

5557
02:38:47,090 --> 02:38:47,361
Hey,

5558
02:38:47,361 --> 02:38:48,170
you never know.

5559
02:38:48,170 --> 02:38:49,580
Pay trans-am dime,

5560
02:38:49,930 --> 02:38:51,590
dime piece after a cage fight.

5561
02:38:52,310 --> 02:38:53,180
It's worth a lot of cash.

5562
02:38:53,240 --> 02:38:54,073
Dan White,

5563
02:38:54,680 --> 02:38:55,070
that's,

5564
02:38:55,070 --> 02:38:55,903
that's a,

5565
02:38:56,060 --> 02:38:58,520
that's an easily sell to America.

5566
02:38:59,750 --> 02:39:00,261
And she,

5567
02:39:00,261 --> 02:39:00,860
uh,

5568
02:39:00,860 --> 02:39:03,950
she fucked up a tattooed chick
from another country that's strong,

5569
02:39:04,550 --> 02:39:05,383
you know,

5570
02:39:06,320 --> 02:39:08,930
and she fucked her up with a
jumping roundhouse kick to the face,

5571
02:39:08,931 --> 02:39:09,890
dancing with the stars.

5572
02:39:09,891 --> 02:39:12,860
Food style revenge of the hotties.

5573
02:39:12,910 --> 02:39:13,670
Look at this.

5574
02:39:13,670 --> 02:39:14,061
Boom.

5575
02:39:14,061 --> 02:39:15,410
She did one to the body there.

5576
02:39:16,190 --> 02:39:16,461
Oh,

5577
02:39:16,461 --> 02:39:17,450
look at that combination.

5578
02:39:19,100 --> 02:39:19,850
There it is.

5579
02:39:19,850 --> 02:39:20,480
Woo.

5580
02:39:20,480 --> 02:39:24,890
Paige vanzant number 10 now what do you
think she is now for this gotta be like

5581
02:39:24,891 --> 02:39:25,551
number seven,

5582
02:39:25,551 --> 02:39:26,384
right?

5583
02:39:26,510 --> 02:39:27,410
She gets the big jump.

5584
02:39:28,340 --> 02:39:29,570
That's a scary division.

5585
02:39:30,080 --> 02:39:30,830
The top,

5586
02:39:30,830 --> 02:39:32,930
the tops got that motherfucker.

5587
02:39:33,620 --> 02:39:34,790
She's probably gonna start acting.

5588
02:39:35,180 --> 02:39:35,841
Does that make a page?

5589
02:39:35,841 --> 02:39:36,350
Van Zandt?

5590
02:39:36,350 --> 02:39:37,190
She certainly could.

5591
02:39:37,460 --> 02:39:41,180
She could quit right now
after that fight on Fox.

5592
02:39:41,480 --> 02:39:45,890
That's a big deal to have that
fight on Fox poffle Paige vanzant

5593
02:39:47,780 --> 02:39:48,860
super marketable.

5594
02:39:48,980 --> 02:39:49,970
Real nice girl too.

5595
02:39:56,360 --> 02:39:58,520
That's a good opening line
for like a hot chicken.

5596
02:39:58,521 --> 02:39:59,031
Excuse me.

5597
02:39:59,031 --> 02:40:01,070
You're very marketable.

5598
02:40:01,100 --> 02:40:02,240
She's super marketable.

5599
02:40:03,240 --> 02:40:04,410
Tell a girl,

5600
02:40:04,760 --> 02:40:05,720
girls in this sport,

5601
02:40:05,930 --> 02:40:08,930
you mock marketable a girl
or a guy in the sport.

5602
02:40:08,931 --> 02:40:10,160
You're in the sport for two reasons,

5603
02:40:10,161 --> 02:40:10,371
right?

5604
02:40:10,371 --> 02:40:11,750
You want to be competitive for sure.

5605
02:40:12,050 --> 02:40:14,010
But two is you want to make a fuck

5606
02:40:14,010 --> 02:40:15,360
load of money and get out while you can.

5607
02:40:15,510 --> 02:40:17,640
And she was even saying when
she realized what she was doing,

5608
02:40:17,641 --> 02:40:18,460
dancing with the stars,

5609
02:40:18,460 --> 02:40:20,620
didn't an interview recently
where she was talking about,

5610
02:40:20,621 --> 02:40:24,660
she realized how much money other
athletes make in comparison to fighters.

5611
02:40:24,710 --> 02:40:26,070
And she wasn't complaining.

5612
02:40:26,071 --> 02:40:27,630
She was just saying like,

5613
02:40:27,750 --> 02:40:28,650
I'm still blessed,

5614
02:40:28,651 --> 02:40:29,670
but you know,

5615
02:40:29,671 --> 02:40:30,040
I'm a,

5616
02:40:30,040 --> 02:40:32,970
this is the UFC pays you more than
any job I've ever had in my life.

5617
02:40:32,971 --> 02:40:33,601
But man,

5618
02:40:33,601 --> 02:40:35,880
you find out what some
athletes make another sports,

5619
02:40:36,180 --> 02:40:38,270
but that's just the way it goes.

5620
02:40:38,300 --> 02:40:42,930
That's just the way this sport is in
this particular period of development.

5621
02:40:42,931 --> 02:40:44,460
And eventually the money will be there.

5622
02:40:44,461 --> 02:40:45,221
But you know,

5623
02:40:45,221 --> 02:40:47,130
for people to say that
it's just the way it is,

5624
02:40:47,160 --> 02:40:48,540
it's going to be there for her though.

5625
02:40:48,541 --> 02:40:49,050
Dude.

5626
02:40:49,050 --> 02:40:49,320
Yeah,

5627
02:40:49,320 --> 02:40:50,910
it's for sure going to be there for her.

5628
02:40:51,990 --> 02:40:52,823
She's laughing.

5629
02:40:52,890 --> 02:40:54,600
She's laughing at missing her own kick.

5630
02:40:55,200 --> 02:40:57,990
But what's funny is right after that,

5631
02:40:58,650 --> 02:40:58,981
she's like,

5632
02:40:58,981 --> 02:40:59,814
what?

5633
02:40:59,960 --> 02:41:01,820
Ooh,

5634
02:41:02,880 --> 02:41:04,410
this is a crazy kick man.

5635
02:41:04,411 --> 02:41:06,540
This is like some Liotta
Machida type shit.

5636
02:41:06,541 --> 02:41:07,860
That's a highlight reel kid.

5637
02:41:07,861 --> 02:41:08,694
His brother,

5638
02:41:08,730 --> 02:41:09,271
the ultimate cheat.

5639
02:41:09,271 --> 02:41:10,380
His brother fought and Bella.

5640
02:41:10,440 --> 02:41:10,950
Yeah.

5641
02:41:10,950 --> 02:41:11,620
How did he do?

5642
02:41:11,620 --> 02:41:13,620
He's got some serious striking,

5643
02:41:13,710 --> 02:41:15,060
nasty karate duty.

5644
02:41:15,061 --> 02:41:16,410
Throw an uppercut clipped.

5645
02:41:16,411 --> 02:41:19,160
The guy won one opera cut
any fights just like him.

5646
02:41:19,170 --> 02:41:21,240
That crime stands where they're
jumping up and down in there.

5647
02:41:21,490 --> 02:41:21,910
You know,

5648
02:41:21,910 --> 02:41:22,681
it's like fencing,

5649
02:41:22,681 --> 02:41:23,670
like a fencing stance.

5650
02:41:24,180 --> 02:41:25,860
He looks legit.

5651
02:41:25,861 --> 02:41:27,330
He's been hurt over the last few years.

5652
02:41:27,331 --> 02:41:28,020
He was,

5653
02:41:28,020 --> 02:41:28,201
you know,

5654
02:41:28,201 --> 02:41:31,110
he's been working on is
a MMA career for awhile,

5655
02:41:31,200 --> 02:41:32,790
but he's like 36 right?

5656
02:41:32,820 --> 02:41:36,440
38 38 mm is striking his left.

5657
02:41:37,350 --> 02:41:39,210
I watched him fight in something else.

5658
02:41:39,211 --> 02:41:40,200
Might've been the RFA.

5659
02:41:40,201 --> 02:41:42,420
What did he find him before this RFI.

5660
02:41:42,510 --> 02:41:43,020
Rfi?

5661
02:41:43,020 --> 02:41:43,380
Yeah.

5662
02:41:43,380 --> 02:41:43,591
Yeah.

5663
02:41:43,591 --> 02:41:44,161
I saw him fight.

5664
02:41:44,161 --> 02:41:44,401
Nah,

5665
02:41:44,401 --> 02:41:47,270
he looked real good and he
does look a lot like Liotta.

5666
02:41:47,400 --> 02:41:49,040
Like a lot of the way he moves and see,

5667
02:41:49,390 --> 02:41:49,590
you know,

5668
02:41:49,590 --> 02:41:50,161
it was thinking to me,

5669
02:41:50,161 --> 02:41:50,600
man.

5670
02:41:50,600 --> 02:41:50,970
Uh,

5671
02:41:50,970 --> 02:41:51,840
it was um,

5672
02:41:52,020 --> 02:41:52,441
something,

5673
02:41:52,441 --> 02:41:52,591
uh,

5674
02:41:52,591 --> 02:41:54,960
I was thinking when I was watching
them fight in the early days,

5675
02:41:54,961 --> 02:41:55,291
I was like,

5676
02:41:55,291 --> 02:41:55,471
man,

5677
02:41:55,471 --> 02:41:57,420
what a grind it is to get into MMA.

5678
02:41:57,960 --> 02:41:58,231
You know,

5679
02:41:58,231 --> 02:42:02,040
you've got these guys that are really
good at a sport and they get to a level,

5680
02:42:02,070 --> 02:42:02,880
is this him here?

5681
02:42:02,880 --> 02:42:03,713
Yeah.

5682
02:42:04,300 --> 02:42:05,133
Okay.

5683
02:42:05,150 --> 02:42:05,331
Oh,

5684
02:42:05,331 --> 02:42:05,751
wait a minute.

5685
02:42:05,751 --> 02:42:08,180
I saw some highlights of this online.

5686
02:42:08,520 --> 02:42:09,353
Yeah.

5687
02:42:09,400 --> 02:42:10,900
It's exactly like Liotta well,

5688
02:42:10,910 --> 02:42:11,180
you know,

5689
02:42:11,180 --> 02:42:12,790
confidence and he throws bombs.

5690
02:42:12,800 --> 02:42:14,840
Did they both learn from their dad?

5691
02:42:15,200 --> 02:42:16,033
What is hard?

5692
02:42:16,340 --> 02:42:17,580
See that little combo.

5693
02:42:17,630 --> 02:42:18,080
Yeah.

5694
02:42:18,080 --> 02:42:20,670
He did that a another time
and really I think he put,

5695
02:42:20,760 --> 02:42:21,920
put the guy on his butt with it.

5696
02:42:21,950 --> 02:42:22,661
Damn Chins.

5697
02:42:22,661 --> 02:42:22,741
Oh,

5698
02:42:22,741 --> 02:42:23,574
looks good.

5699
02:42:23,920 --> 02:42:24,650
Yeah.

5700
02:42:24,650 --> 02:42:26,210
I wonder why the UFC didn't sign them.

5701
02:42:28,190 --> 02:42:29,840
Seems like that would be a good signing.

5702
02:42:29,900 --> 02:42:30,733
You know,

5703
02:42:31,370 --> 02:42:35,720
sign this Guy Bella
tour looked really good,

5704
02:42:35,990 --> 02:42:36,651
but you know what,

5705
02:42:36,651 --> 02:42:37,490
a guy like this,

5706
02:42:37,491 --> 02:42:38,324
you know,

5707
02:42:38,630 --> 02:42:42,770
have a few fights and Bella
tour and then maybe a the UFC,

5708
02:42:42,771 --> 02:42:44,390
we'll bring them over just like a,

5709
02:42:45,560 --> 02:42:45,810
okay.

5710
02:42:45,810 --> 02:42:46,980
They did a with,

5711
02:42:46,981 --> 02:42:47,814
um,

5712
02:42:49,110 --> 02:42:49,943
what's his name?

5713
02:42:50,220 --> 02:42:51,053
Will.

5714
02:42:51,740 --> 02:42:52,330
Okay.

5715
02:42:52,330 --> 02:42:53,051
Uh,

5716
02:42:53,051 --> 02:42:53,770
Eddie Alvarez?

5717
02:42:53,770 --> 02:42:54,030
No.

5718
02:42:54,030 --> 02:42:54,260
Whoa.

5719
02:42:54,260 --> 02:42:55,540
Of course Eddie Alvarez for sure,

5720
02:42:55,860 --> 02:42:56,800
but recently.

5721
02:42:57,050 --> 02:42:57,610
Goddammit.

5722
02:42:57,610 --> 02:42:58,810
Why am I blanking on his name?

5723
02:43:00,220 --> 02:43:01,120
He just won.

5724
02:43:01,300 --> 02:43:02,810
He just beat some money.

5725
02:43:03,430 --> 02:43:03,850
I didn't,

5726
02:43:03,850 --> 02:43:05,080
I didn't call the fight though.

5727
02:43:10,790 --> 02:43:13,420
He Bella tours champion
at one point in time.

5728
02:43:14,050 --> 02:43:14,621
Yes.

5729
02:43:14,621 --> 02:43:14,981
Thank you,

5730
02:43:14,981 --> 02:43:15,460
sir.

5731
02:43:15,460 --> 02:43:16,120
Thank you sir.

5732
02:43:16,120 --> 02:43:16,953
We'll Brooks.

5733
02:43:17,320 --> 02:43:17,531
Yeah,

5734
02:43:17,531 --> 02:43:19,210
we'll Brooks just came
over from bell tower.

5735
02:43:19,240 --> 02:43:19,950
It's like,

5736
02:43:19,950 --> 02:43:20,201
you know,

5737
02:43:20,201 --> 02:43:22,240
they're going to probably
exchange stuff back and forth now.

5738
02:43:22,241 --> 02:43:23,140
Rory is over there.

5739
02:43:23,141 --> 02:43:24,940
Roy McDonald just signed to Bella tour.

5740
02:43:25,300 --> 02:43:25,840
Dude.

5741
02:43:25,840 --> 02:43:28,960
Roy McDonald versus Michael Page Ho Lee.

5742
02:43:28,961 --> 02:43:29,794
Shit.

5743
02:43:30,160 --> 02:43:30,850
I'm in.

5744
02:43:30,850 --> 02:43:31,750
I want to see that fight.

5745
02:43:33,130 --> 02:43:34,120
That's an interesting fight.

5746
02:43:34,390 --> 02:43:39,390
I think that good competition is good
and I think that a good competition like,

5747
02:43:39,461 --> 02:43:39,820
uh,

5748
02:43:39,820 --> 02:43:40,810
like Bella [inaudible].

5749
02:43:41,080 --> 02:43:42,460
I think it's good for MMA.

5750
02:43:42,670 --> 02:43:43,870
It's good for the UFC.

5751
02:43:43,900 --> 02:43:45,670
It's good for business.

5752
02:43:46,600 --> 02:43:47,670
It's good for business,

5753
02:43:48,460 --> 02:43:49,270
isn't it?

5754
02:43:49,270 --> 02:43:50,103
I agree.

5755
02:43:50,770 --> 02:43:52,630
We need a bunch of organizations.

5756
02:43:52,810 --> 02:43:53,081
You know,

5757
02:43:53,081 --> 02:43:53,351
there's,

5758
02:43:53,351 --> 02:43:53,830
um,

5759
02:43:53,830 --> 02:43:56,710
there's an a large potential
for growth in this sport.

5760
02:43:56,711 --> 02:43:57,221
Bella tours,

5761
02:43:57,221 --> 02:43:58,001
probably number two,

5762
02:43:58,001 --> 02:43:58,720
right?

5763
02:43:58,720 --> 02:43:58,871
Oh,

5764
02:43:58,871 --> 02:43:59,500
for sure.

5765
02:43:59,500 --> 02:44:00,333
Who's number three?

5766
02:44:00,790 --> 02:44:01,690
Probably one IFC.

5767
02:44:01,750 --> 02:44:02,081
I mean,

5768
02:44:02,081 --> 02:44:02,914
I don't know.

5769
02:44:03,100 --> 02:44:04,200
It would have to be a,

5770
02:44:04,240 --> 02:44:04,540
well,

5771
02:44:04,540 --> 02:44:05,080
you know,

5772
02:44:05,080 --> 02:44:05,530
uh,

5773
02:44:05,530 --> 02:44:08,650
world series of fighting does have some
really good fighters but doesn't get

5774
02:44:08,651 --> 02:44:10,720
another enough love for some reason.

5775
02:44:10,870 --> 02:44:11,621
That's kind of interesting,

5776
02:44:11,621 --> 02:44:12,130
right?

5777
02:44:12,130 --> 02:44:12,963
It's on NBC.

5778
02:44:14,620 --> 02:44:15,453
Yeah.

5779
02:44:15,580 --> 02:44:17,890
But like world series
of fighting has Fitch.

5780
02:44:18,040 --> 02:44:20,560
They had Paul Horace
until they kicked him out.

5781
02:44:20,710 --> 02:44:21,340
Take Shield.

5782
02:44:21,340 --> 02:44:22,540
They have Jake shields.

5783
02:44:22,790 --> 02:44:23,260
Um,

5784
02:44:23,260 --> 02:44:24,810
they got Marlin Mris.

5785
02:44:24,811 --> 02:44:26,180
Who's a bad motherfucker.

5786
02:44:26,230 --> 02:44:27,460
They got just engage you.

5787
02:44:27,461 --> 02:44:29,050
Who's a bad motherfucker.

5788
02:44:29,560 --> 02:44:30,251
They got some good for,

5789
02:44:30,251 --> 02:44:31,600
they had Tyrone Spong.

5790
02:44:31,601 --> 02:44:33,820
I don't know if Taiwan spawn
is still doing MMA though.

5791
02:44:34,150 --> 02:44:38,260
I think Taiwan spawn might have
decided to go to straight boxing.

5792
02:44:38,680 --> 02:44:40,600
He's doing really well
and straight boxing.

5793
02:44:41,050 --> 02:44:42,520
It's got nasty hands man.

5794
02:44:43,030 --> 02:44:43,361
You know.

5795
02:44:43,361 --> 02:44:45,010
And he got Alan Jobe on pot.

5796
02:44:45,460 --> 02:44:46,060
No,

5797
02:44:46,060 --> 02:44:46,301
no,

5798
02:44:46,301 --> 02:44:46,451
no.

5799
02:44:46,451 --> 02:44:47,284
He's much larger.

5800
02:44:47,590 --> 02:44:48,450
He's a,

5801
02:44:48,470 --> 02:44:48,970
uh,

5802
02:44:48,970 --> 02:44:49,360
Weiss,

5803
02:44:49,360 --> 02:44:49,751
I guess.

5804
02:44:49,751 --> 02:44:51,340
Essentially he's a light heavyweight.

5805
02:44:51,341 --> 02:44:52,600
If he was an MMA fighter,

5806
02:44:52,810 --> 02:44:54,220
but he could fight heavyweight too.

5807
02:44:54,280 --> 02:44:55,113
He's fought,

5808
02:44:55,170 --> 02:44:55,520
he's fun.

5809
02:44:55,520 --> 02:44:56,560
It's a pretty big boys.

5810
02:44:57,010 --> 02:44:58,030
I would like to know what he,

5811
02:44:58,060 --> 02:44:59,030
what Wade he fights at.

5812
02:44:59,031 --> 02:44:59,411
And I would,

5813
02:44:59,411 --> 02:45:02,410
I would imagine it would be in the
two twenties or something like that.

5814
02:45:02,650 --> 02:45:04,000
What's the latest with Mark Hunt?

5815
02:45:04,170 --> 02:45:04,451
You know,

5816
02:45:04,451 --> 02:45:04,841
he's out.

5817
02:45:04,841 --> 02:45:06,450
He been protested about that.

5818
02:45:06,451 --> 02:45:09,350
Brock Lesnar's test Zuma.

5819
02:45:09,510 --> 02:45:10,343
That's Obama.

5820
02:45:10,570 --> 02:45:12,040
And he's really a bummer for him.

5821
02:45:12,130 --> 02:45:12,481
Yeah.

5822
02:45:12,481 --> 02:45:13,480
It's a bummer for him,

5823
02:45:14,230 --> 02:45:14,471
you know,

5824
02:45:14,471 --> 02:45:14,861
because,

5825
02:45:14,861 --> 02:45:15,250
uh,

5826
02:45:15,250 --> 02:45:17,320
that's stuff that Brock tested for.

5827
02:45:17,440 --> 02:45:17,741
I mean,

5828
02:45:17,741 --> 02:45:18,190
it's not a,

5829
02:45:18,190 --> 02:45:19,600
it's not really a steroid.

5830
02:45:19,601 --> 02:45:20,800
It's something that helps you,

5831
02:45:20,801 --> 02:45:21,610
uh,

5832
02:45:21,610 --> 02:45:25,750
bring your body back after your
endocrine system shuts down.

5833
02:45:25,810 --> 02:45:26,231
Obviously,

5834
02:45:26,231 --> 02:45:26,921
I'm not a doctor.

5835
02:45:26,921 --> 02:45:27,754
Ladies and gentlemen,

5836
02:45:28,090 --> 02:45:29,080
don't take my word for those.

5837
02:45:29,081 --> 02:45:29,914
Cj.

5838
02:45:29,990 --> 02:45:30,470
Um,

5839
02:45:30,470 --> 02:45:31,960
it's Clomiphene,

5840
02:45:31,990 --> 02:45:32,890
I believe it's called.

5841
02:45:32,891 --> 02:45:34,180
I think that's what they released.

5842
02:45:34,430 --> 02:45:38,770
What that stuff is an estrogen
blocker and it helps your body produce

5843
02:45:38,771 --> 02:45:39,700
testosterone.

5844
02:45:40,210 --> 02:45:40,751
And it could,

5845
02:45:40,751 --> 02:45:41,560
uh,

5846
02:45:41,560 --> 02:45:42,130
you know,

5847
02:45:42,130 --> 02:45:46,570
you could be taking it for a legit reason
or he could be taking it because you

5848
02:45:46,571 --> 02:45:51,040
need your body to really kickstart
it's testosterone after you,

5849
02:45:51,041 --> 02:45:51,700
uh,

5850
02:45:51,700 --> 02:45:52,540
overdosed it,

5851
02:45:52,780 --> 02:45:53,300
you know,

5852
02:45:53,300 --> 02:45:54,400
shut the balls down.

5853
02:45:54,850 --> 02:45:55,451
So that's the,

5854
02:45:55,451 --> 02:45:56,830
that's the real concern.

5855
02:45:56,831 --> 02:45:59,140
When people hear that someone
was taking an estrogen blocker,

5856
02:45:59,350 --> 02:45:59,561
like,

5857
02:45:59,561 --> 02:45:59,801
okay,

5858
02:45:59,801 --> 02:46:00,634
why?

5859
02:46:00,850 --> 02:46:02,500
Apparently the Jon Jones story,

5860
02:46:02,890 --> 02:46:07,270
which red band predicted
hilariously is a boner pills.

5861
02:46:07,300 --> 02:46:09,590
What did predict that boner pills?

5862
02:46:09,770 --> 02:46:12,650
Because red pen is taking those
boner pills a bunch of times.

5863
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:13,281
He said,

5864
02:46:13,281 --> 02:46:13,491
dude,

5865
02:46:13,491 --> 02:46:14,720
there's definitely steroids in them.

5866
02:46:14,780 --> 02:46:15,980
They make you like crazy.

5867
02:46:16,370 --> 02:46:16,671
He's like,

5868
02:46:16,671 --> 02:46:16,851
there,

5869
02:46:16,851 --> 02:46:17,840
there's a bunch of shit in there.

5870
02:46:17,841 --> 02:46:18,674
Who knows what's in there?

5871
02:46:19,220 --> 02:46:23,180
Like he just buy these gas station
boner pills and that's what Brian said.

5872
02:46:23,181 --> 02:46:23,481
And I said,

5873
02:46:23,481 --> 02:46:23,571
well,

5874
02:46:23,571 --> 02:46:24,231
it makes you think that.

5875
02:46:24,231 --> 02:46:24,950
And he was like,

5876
02:46:24,950 --> 02:46:25,161
well,

5877
02:46:25,161 --> 02:46:26,270
because he,

5878
02:46:26,271 --> 02:46:27,170
he likes to party,

5879
02:46:27,171 --> 02:46:27,411
right?

5880
02:46:27,411 --> 02:46:29,060
Like John Jones tested positive for coke.

5881
02:46:29,061 --> 02:46:29,361
He was like,

5882
02:46:29,361 --> 02:46:30,380
people that like to do coke,

5883
02:46:30,410 --> 02:46:32,690
they want to take like boner
pills to get their dick hard.

5884
02:46:33,770 --> 02:46:34,041
I'm like,

5885
02:46:34,041 --> 02:46:34,874
oh my God,

5886
02:46:35,120 --> 02:46:35,930
he nailed it.

5887
02:46:35,930 --> 02:46:36,201
I'm like,

5888
02:46:36,201 --> 02:46:37,034
he nailed it.

5889
02:46:38,480 --> 02:46:39,081
He nailed it.

5890
02:46:39,081 --> 02:46:40,310
Good CSI shit.

5891
02:46:40,580 --> 02:46:42,230
You should be an investigative reporter.

5892
02:46:43,650 --> 02:46:44,483
Crop the case.

5893
02:46:44,930 --> 02:46:45,650
And he was right.

5894
02:46:45,650 --> 02:46:46,483
It was bro.

5895
02:46:46,970 --> 02:46:48,410
Gonna Forgive John John's like,

5896
02:46:48,440 --> 02:46:48,591
ah,

5897
02:46:48,591 --> 02:46:49,820
those are just boner pills.

5898
02:46:50,060 --> 02:46:50,841
I think that's okay.

5899
02:46:50,841 --> 02:46:51,260
Right?

5900
02:46:51,260 --> 02:46:51,711
Well the,

5901
02:46:51,711 --> 02:46:55,080
there was even talk about about how
long the suspension would be for Brock

5902
02:46:55,080 --> 02:46:55,470
Lesnar.

5903
02:46:55,470 --> 02:46:56,520
It's all weird man.

5904
02:46:56,550 --> 02:46:57,241
It's real weird.

5905
02:46:57,241 --> 02:46:59,580
And here's another thing about
like things like Bella Tura.

5906
02:46:59,581 --> 02:47:02,400
Somebody brought this
up online on Twitter,

5907
02:47:02,750 --> 02:47:04,010
whether Bella tour,

5908
02:47:04,110 --> 02:47:04,440
uh,

5909
02:47:04,440 --> 02:47:07,920
gets tested by Usada and I
don't know the answer to that.

5910
02:47:08,220 --> 02:47:09,270
I don't know what they,

5911
02:47:09,580 --> 02:47:11,230
how they test or what they test.

5912
02:47:11,231 --> 02:47:15,220
I know people have tested positive
for some shit before it Bella tour,

5913
02:47:15,760 --> 02:47:16,900
but I don't know when,

5914
02:47:17,040 --> 02:47:18,250
and not to know what commission,

5915
02:47:18,251 --> 02:47:23,251
but I do not imagine in any way that
it's as stringent as the test of the UFC

5916
02:47:24,251 --> 02:47:25,084
does.

5917
02:47:25,330 --> 02:47:26,163
Right.

5918
02:47:26,680 --> 02:47:27,960
There's no way peers,

5919
02:47:27,961 --> 02:47:31,490
the peers that like Bobby Lashley yeah.

5920
02:47:31,560 --> 02:47:33,360
Does not pass the smell test.

5921
02:47:33,361 --> 02:47:33,720
No,

5922
02:47:33,720 --> 02:47:34,260
no,

5923
02:47:34,260 --> 02:47:34,791
no offense.

5924
02:47:34,791 --> 02:47:35,230
Bobby,

5925
02:47:35,230 --> 02:47:36,660
you literally a hell of an athlete,

5926
02:47:37,140 --> 02:47:38,750
but that looks like your job.

5927
02:47:38,850 --> 02:47:43,020
Or one 58 they were tested by the
Mohegan Department of Athletic Regulation

5928
02:47:43,690 --> 02:47:44,190
testing.

5929
02:47:44,190 --> 02:47:44,610
Okay.

5930
02:47:44,610 --> 02:47:46,020
So that's more Mohegan Sun.

5931
02:47:46,440 --> 02:47:48,480
That must be where the casino is.

5932
02:47:48,510 --> 02:47:50,880
They probably have their own
athletic commission and a,

5933
02:47:50,881 --> 02:47:51,450
you know,

5934
02:47:51,450 --> 02:47:54,280
who knows what methods they use
and who knows whether it's a,

5935
02:47:54,570 --> 02:47:58,260
just a post fight test like they used
to do in the UFC and a lot of guys had

5936
02:47:58,261 --> 02:47:59,640
figured out how to crack the system.

5937
02:47:59,670 --> 02:48:00,503
I Dunno,

5938
02:48:00,890 --> 02:48:01,920
it's a good question.

5939
02:48:01,980 --> 02:48:02,813
Who knows.

5940
02:48:03,600 --> 02:48:05,490
It'd be an interesting
choice for people that,

5941
02:48:05,520 --> 02:48:06,353
um,

5942
02:48:06,690 --> 02:48:07,650
wanted to,

5943
02:48:07,651 --> 02:48:08,484
uh,

5944
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:10,050
wanted to get some help.

5945
02:48:11,780 --> 02:48:12,061
You know,

5946
02:48:12,061 --> 02:48:17,061
didn't want to completely jump into
this new school of constant testing.

5947
02:48:17,730 --> 02:48:18,061
I feel like.

5948
02:48:18,061 --> 02:48:19,980
How would you just test me
after the fight and just,

5949
02:48:19,981 --> 02:48:21,510
we'll just work this out in camp.

5950
02:48:21,940 --> 02:48:26,940
How about Nate Diaz pulling out that vape
pen and his press conference that took

5951
02:48:27,071 --> 02:48:27,541
balls,

5952
02:48:27,541 --> 02:48:28,300
Huh?

5953
02:48:28,300 --> 02:48:29,960
Shit against,

5954
02:48:30,560 --> 02:48:30,750
well,

5955
02:48:30,750 --> 02:48:32,590
I didn't even think he thought
he was doing anything wrong.

5956
02:48:32,620 --> 02:48:33,910
It's a CBD oil pen.

5957
02:48:34,180 --> 02:48:35,440
He probably didn't realize.

5958
02:48:36,820 --> 02:48:38,050
Most people just can't,

5959
02:48:38,170 --> 02:48:41,260
they can't make the distinction
between CBD oil and pot.

5960
02:48:41,560 --> 02:48:41,831
You know,

5961
02:48:41,831 --> 02:48:42,664
that CBD oils,

5962
02:48:42,700 --> 02:48:43,870
just some shit that you do.

5963
02:48:44,140 --> 02:48:47,560
I take that every day
just as a antioxidant,

5964
02:48:47,660 --> 02:48:48,820
antiinflammatory.

5965
02:48:49,530 --> 02:48:49,810
Well,

5966
02:48:49,810 --> 02:48:51,160
CBD oils natural.

5967
02:48:51,520 --> 02:48:56,520
If people aren't taking that and there's
been lots of reports of success taking,

5968
02:48:57,960 --> 02:48:58,300
uh,

5969
02:48:58,300 --> 02:49:01,270
this CBD oil when you
have any kind of cancer,

5970
02:49:01,271 --> 02:49:01,541
you know,

5971
02:49:01,541 --> 02:49:02,374
they've been,

5972
02:49:02,530 --> 02:49:03,520
they've been good studies.

5973
02:49:03,521 --> 02:49:04,000
One,

5974
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:07,180
why not just take it before
just maybe as a preventative,

5975
02:49:07,350 --> 02:49:07,660
you know,

5976
02:49:07,660 --> 02:49:08,430
can't hurt.

5977
02:49:08,430 --> 02:49:09,170
Yeah,

5978
02:49:09,170 --> 02:49:10,003
that's what I do.

5979
02:49:10,320 --> 02:49:10,920
Um,

5980
02:49:10,920 --> 02:49:12,750
a lot of people report
good results with it,

5981
02:49:13,290 --> 02:49:13,651
you know,

5982
02:49:13,651 --> 02:49:14,000
and it's,

5983
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:15,420
it's supposed to be really good for pain.

5984
02:49:15,510 --> 02:49:16,500
People have crazy.

5985
02:49:16,501 --> 02:49:17,730
Is it that,

5986
02:49:18,760 --> 02:49:18,990
you know,

5987
02:49:18,990 --> 02:49:21,180
we have a state like Colorado
and there's other states too,

5988
02:49:21,181 --> 02:49:22,560
like Washington and Oregon now,

5989
02:49:22,950 --> 02:49:24,570
but there's states where it's,

5990
02:49:24,890 --> 02:49:25,710
it's like,

5991
02:49:25,710 --> 02:49:26,161
it's like a,

5992
02:49:26,161 --> 02:49:27,360
it's like going to Amsterdam.

5993
02:49:27,361 --> 02:49:28,800
Colorado is like Amsterdam,

5994
02:49:28,801 --> 02:49:30,000
but then we got another Amsterdam,

5995
02:49:30,001 --> 02:49:30,751
we got to Washington,

5996
02:49:30,751 --> 02:49:31,110
Amsterdam,

5997
02:49:31,110 --> 02:49:32,370
we've got an Oregon Amsterdam.

5998
02:49:32,670 --> 02:49:33,750
But Colorado is,

5999
02:49:34,110 --> 02:49:38,880
that's probably the most famous state
for legalizing recreational use.

6000
02:49:38,970 --> 02:49:42,840
How crazy is it that we're living in a
world like that do to change their whole

6001
02:49:42,841 --> 02:49:44,780
economy chaser economy?

6002
02:49:44,900 --> 02:49:45,930
Denver is booming.

6003
02:49:46,270 --> 02:49:46,660
It's,

6004
02:49:46,660 --> 02:49:47,820
it's like a gold rush.

6005
02:49:47,850 --> 02:49:48,930
It's like they found gold,

6006
02:49:48,960 --> 02:49:49,391
it's green,

6007
02:49:49,391 --> 02:49:51,710
and they just like skyscrapers everywhere.

6008
02:49:51,720 --> 02:49:52,320
Is it like that?

6009
02:49:52,320 --> 02:49:52,561
Well,

6010
02:49:52,561 --> 02:49:54,810
the real estate has gone
up by a significant amount.

6011
02:49:54,810 --> 02:49:57,240
Last time I heard it was like 14 or 16%,

6012
02:49:57,390 --> 02:49:58,950
like the real estate prices have gone up.

6013
02:49:59,270 --> 02:50:00,103
Um,

6014
02:50:00,330 --> 02:50:02,910
drunk driving is the lowest
it's been in decades.

6015
02:50:03,090 --> 02:50:04,020
Violent crimes,

6016
02:50:04,021 --> 02:50:06,180
Lowe's has been in a long time.

6017
02:50:06,930 --> 02:50:07,561
It's crazy,

6018
02:50:07,561 --> 02:50:08,040
man.

6019
02:50:08,040 --> 02:50:08,873
It's weird.

6020
02:50:08,910 --> 02:50:09,481
It's weird.

6021
02:50:09,481 --> 02:50:11,610
People will run instances
of teenage drunk.

6022
02:50:11,670 --> 02:50:12,120
Yeah.

6023
02:50:12,120 --> 02:50:13,020
Drunk driving,

6024
02:50:13,021 --> 02:50:14,800
getting pulled over with booze lot.

6025
02:50:14,810 --> 02:50:18,810
A lot of less instances of teenagers
getting families from all over the world

6026
02:50:18,990 --> 02:50:22,080
uprooting and taking their
kids that have seizures.

6027
02:50:22,081 --> 02:50:23,010
20 a day.

6028
02:50:23,250 --> 02:50:26,700
They've taken them in and starting a
new life in Colorado and the kids are

6029
02:50:26,701 --> 02:50:27,300
having,

6030
02:50:27,300 --> 02:50:30,240
they're down to one seizure
a week or maybe even less,

6031
02:50:30,241 --> 02:50:30,980
maybe even the last.

6032
02:50:30,980 --> 02:50:31,170
Yeah,

6033
02:50:31,170 --> 02:50:32,040
that's a big point.

6034
02:50:32,041 --> 02:50:33,290
And one of them off,

6035
02:50:33,900 --> 02:50:34,141
you know,

6036
02:50:34,141 --> 02:50:34,891
my friend Johnny,

6037
02:50:34,891 --> 02:50:35,724
Johnny rotten.

6038
02:50:35,940 --> 02:50:38,550
You remember Johnny Johnny's a kid.

6039
02:50:38,610 --> 02:50:39,180
Um,

6040
02:50:39,180 --> 02:50:40,440
he had uh,

6041
02:50:40,441 --> 02:50:40,711
some,

6042
02:50:40,711 --> 02:50:42,390
some real issues and um,

6043
02:50:42,480 --> 02:50:45,000
the cannabis oil and eating hash and like,

6044
02:50:45,001 --> 02:50:48,180
like you saw that documentary where
they had that kid or that a news report

6045
02:50:48,181 --> 02:50:50,190
rather where they had that kid who was,

6046
02:50:50,191 --> 02:50:51,024
um,

6047
02:50:51,150 --> 02:50:52,650
he was having some seizures.

6048
02:50:52,800 --> 02:50:53,310
And a,

6049
02:50:53,310 --> 02:50:56,580
they didn't know what to do and they were
like at their last rope and they tried

6050
02:50:56,581 --> 02:50:57,091
cannabis,

6051
02:50:57,091 --> 02:51:01,050
they started giving this kid a
Charlotte's web was in like a mango.

6052
02:51:01,051 --> 02:51:04,440
They would give it to them and like pieces
of fruit or a melon or something like

6053
02:51:04,441 --> 02:51:05,030
that.

6054
02:51:05,030 --> 02:51:07,800
I mean this kid is completely
stopped all the seizures,

6055
02:51:08,160 --> 02:51:09,120
but it's apparently really,

6056
02:51:09,121 --> 02:51:09,481
really,

6057
02:51:09,481 --> 02:51:10,680
really effective for that.

6058
02:51:10,980 --> 02:51:11,161
Yeah.

6059
02:51:11,161 --> 02:51:15,120
So anybody out there that if you know
anybody with kids that have seizures and

6060
02:51:15,121 --> 02:51:15,240
they're,

6061
02:51:15,240 --> 02:51:16,220
they're on the medications,

6062
02:51:16,221 --> 02:51:17,760
there's a whole shit
load of them out there.

6063
02:51:18,270 --> 02:51:19,740
There is hope for them.

6064
02:51:19,830 --> 02:51:22,110
You got to move to Colorado or you know,

6065
02:51:22,111 --> 02:51:23,030
you'd just get a,

6066
02:51:23,370 --> 02:51:24,060
you just get it,

6067
02:51:24,060 --> 02:51:26,220
stay where you're at and
just get it anyway you can,

6068
02:51:26,221 --> 02:51:26,401
you know,

6069
02:51:26,401 --> 02:51:27,540
to save your kid's life.

6070
02:51:27,630 --> 02:51:28,351
Or You could move,

6071
02:51:28,351 --> 02:51:29,670
but there's a place you can go,

6072
02:51:29,950 --> 02:51:30,541
Colorado,

6073
02:51:30,541 --> 02:51:31,051
Washington,

6074
02:51:31,051 --> 02:51:31,770
Oregon,

6075
02:51:31,770 --> 02:51:33,030
you can take your,

6076
02:51:33,130 --> 02:51:35,040
your kids seizures are the kids that,

6077
02:51:35,041 --> 02:51:35,874
you know,

6078
02:51:35,880 --> 02:51:36,511
relatives,

6079
02:51:36,511 --> 02:51:36,840
whatever.

6080
02:51:36,840 --> 02:51:38,790
You could take them to once a week,

6081
02:51:39,060 --> 02:51:40,500
maybe once every two weeks.

6082
02:51:40,800 --> 02:51:42,480
That those are the results I'm hearing.

6083
02:51:42,510 --> 02:51:42,721
Yeah.

6084
02:51:42,721 --> 02:51:45,810
And there's also other parts of the same
country that we live in right now where

6085
02:51:45,811 --> 02:51:48,720
if you took that same medics
and and you got caught with it,

6086
02:51:48,750 --> 02:51:49,680
you go to jail,

6087
02:51:49,770 --> 02:51:50,940
a guaranteed go to jail.

6088
02:51:50,970 --> 02:51:53,790
There's a bunch of stupid
spots in this country,

6089
02:51:53,960 --> 02:51:55,260
but they're not bad people.

6090
02:51:55,261 --> 02:51:59,010
They're just operating on bad old ideas
and they think of themselves as being

6091
02:51:59,011 --> 02:51:59,844
good people.

6092
02:52:00,180 --> 02:52:02,400
And I bet in your head
you are a good person.

6093
02:52:02,940 --> 02:52:07,940
But if you're enforcing marijuana
laws in 2016 you're on the wrong side.

6094
02:52:10,120 --> 02:52:11,500
You were on the wrong side.

6095
02:52:11,530 --> 02:52:13,240
It helps a lot of people
with a lot of shit.

6096
02:52:13,241 --> 02:52:17,020
And if somebody is trying to
get their kid some medicine and,

6097
02:52:17,060 --> 02:52:19,870
and you are trying to stop
them and lock them in a cage,

6098
02:52:20,110 --> 02:52:22,510
and this is a medicine that
grew out of the ground.

6099
02:52:22,540 --> 02:52:23,770
You're out of your fucking mind.

6100
02:52:24,190 --> 02:52:24,401
You're,

6101
02:52:24,401 --> 02:52:26,680
you're operating on some
old voodoo schedule,

6102
02:52:26,681 --> 02:52:27,514
one drug,

6103
02:52:28,020 --> 02:52:29,680
they wouldn't change it.

6104
02:52:29,681 --> 02:52:31,180
They wouldn't change the classification.

6105
02:52:32,350 --> 02:52:34,450
Maybe a Hillary's going
to do it when she gets in.

6106
02:52:35,170 --> 02:52:36,003
Maybe they made a deal.

6107
02:52:36,250 --> 02:52:37,390
Let's make the big change when we get it.

6108
02:52:37,391 --> 02:52:38,440
And let's hold on to her cards.

6109
02:52:38,980 --> 02:52:39,220
Okay.

6110
02:52:39,220 --> 02:52:40,053
We're going to get in

6111
02:52:41,590 --> 02:52:45,010
this country is in some serious trouble.

6112
02:52:45,130 --> 02:52:46,060
Jesus Christ.

6113
02:52:46,090 --> 02:52:47,440
We get to make a new system.

6114
02:52:47,470 --> 02:52:48,400
Jesus fucking,

6115
02:52:48,430 --> 02:52:49,210
they don't want to,

6116
02:52:49,210 --> 02:52:50,120
they don't want to do it.

6117
02:52:50,690 --> 02:52:53,140
System so obvious that it's rigged.

6118
02:52:53,170 --> 02:52:53,411
I mean,

6119
02:52:53,411 --> 02:52:54,640
when you got Hillary and Trump,

6120
02:52:54,880 --> 02:52:56,290
that's rig fucking,

6121
02:52:57,670 --> 02:52:58,690
they're clawing at it,

6122
02:52:58,691 --> 02:52:58,931
man.

6123
02:52:58,931 --> 02:53:00,850
They trying to hold onto
it as long as they can.

6124
02:53:01,600 --> 02:53:02,470
So red,

6125
02:53:02,620 --> 02:53:05,350
it's going to be interesting to see
how much longer we can continue to,

6126
02:53:05,650 --> 02:53:06,040
I mean,

6127
02:53:06,040 --> 02:53:07,930
how about country that operates like this,

6128
02:53:07,990 --> 02:53:11,800
but that election fraud shit that happened
in California with Hillary and Bernie

6129
02:53:11,800 --> 02:53:12,140
Sanders.

6130
02:53:12,140 --> 02:53:12,641
It's,

6131
02:53:12,641 --> 02:53:13,690
it's like viral.

6132
02:53:14,150 --> 02:53:15,160
As soon as that happens,

6133
02:53:15,161 --> 02:53:15,551
boom.

6134
02:53:15,551 --> 02:53:16,241
Orlando.

6135
02:53:16,241 --> 02:53:17,074
Pam,

6136
02:53:17,110 --> 02:53:18,160
what if,

6137
02:53:18,250 --> 02:53:18,420
well,

6138
02:53:18,420 --> 02:53:19,450
there's always speculation.

6139
02:53:19,451 --> 02:53:21,100
What's been proven about voter fraud?

6140
02:53:21,130 --> 02:53:23,360
Is there anything you've
been proven or no,

6141
02:53:23,500 --> 02:53:24,010
I didn't.

6142
02:53:24,010 --> 02:53:24,610
I,

6143
02:53:24,610 --> 02:53:25,450
it's not something,

6144
02:53:25,900 --> 02:53:27,220
it's not something that uh,

6145
02:53:27,460 --> 02:53:27,730
um,

6146
02:53:27,730 --> 02:53:29,710
that shocked where I
need them to evidence.

6147
02:53:29,711 --> 02:53:30,280
I'm like,

6148
02:53:30,280 --> 02:53:31,900
it's like telling me
that some horror fucks.

6149
02:53:31,901 --> 02:53:32,531
Some other dude,

6150
02:53:32,531 --> 02:53:33,340
I'm not going to,

6151
02:53:33,340 --> 02:53:33,491
oh,

6152
02:53:33,491 --> 02:53:34,600
I need to fucking video.

6153
02:53:34,601 --> 02:53:34,960
I'm like,

6154
02:53:34,960 --> 02:53:36,070
it would just be nice.

6155
02:53:36,310 --> 02:53:37,180
Just be nice.

6156
02:53:37,210 --> 02:53:38,043
Make sense?

6157
02:53:38,560 --> 02:53:41,770
It would just be nice if you couldn't
get rich running the government.

6158
02:53:42,040 --> 02:53:44,020
It'd be nice if you could just,

6159
02:53:44,021 --> 02:53:44,471
you know,

6160
02:53:44,471 --> 02:53:46,150
there's no way you could
do this to get rich.

6161
02:53:46,270 --> 02:53:47,020
You just can't do it.

6162
02:53:47,020 --> 02:53:47,853
I think that,

6163
02:53:48,250 --> 02:53:49,083
I mean,

6164
02:53:50,020 --> 02:53:50,441
Jesus,

6165
02:53:50,441 --> 02:53:51,430
there's this no hope.

6166
02:53:51,640 --> 02:53:52,310
There's no,

6167
02:53:52,310 --> 02:53:53,050
there are too many,

6168
02:53:53,050 --> 02:53:55,180
too many people are just there with it.

6169
02:53:55,210 --> 02:53:56,860
They just got him on that media.

6170
02:53:57,670 --> 02:53:59,140
They're addicted to that media.

6171
02:53:59,170 --> 02:54:01,000
There's just no way around it.

6172
02:54:01,450 --> 02:54:02,283
I mean there's a,

6173
02:54:02,530 --> 02:54:05,620
there's a quote that I posted
on Instagram from Jim Morrison,

6174
02:54:06,010 --> 02:54:06,550
um,

6175
02:54:06,550 --> 02:54:06,920
at him.

6176
02:54:06,920 --> 02:54:08,110
I'm sure he didn't make it up,

6177
02:54:08,380 --> 02:54:12,790
but it says those who control the
media control the mind is that says Jim

6178
02:54:12,790 --> 02:54:12,791
Morris.

6179
02:54:12,791 --> 02:54:14,620
That got a bunch of it was,

6180
02:54:14,860 --> 02:54:15,730
I'm sure it was,

6181
02:54:16,120 --> 02:54:16,953
but that,

6182
02:54:17,260 --> 02:54:17,830
that isn't,

6183
02:54:17,830 --> 02:54:18,940
I mean that's,

6184
02:54:19,330 --> 02:54:21,010
that's everything right there.

6185
02:54:21,190 --> 02:54:21,521
Yeah,

6186
02:54:21,521 --> 02:54:21,731
no,

6187
02:54:21,731 --> 02:54:22,091
it's true.

6188
02:54:22,091 --> 02:54:24,620
But the thing is today isn't the media.

6189
02:54:24,621 --> 02:54:25,090
I like,

6190
02:54:25,090 --> 02:54:25,570
boy,

6191
02:54:25,570 --> 02:54:27,430
what a slippery grip they have on it.

6192
02:54:27,790 --> 02:54:29,230
It seems so slippery than me.

6193
02:54:29,350 --> 02:54:29,861
They got it.

6194
02:54:29,861 --> 02:54:31,270
They got it all under control.

6195
02:54:31,480 --> 02:54:32,170
Cause there's a lot.

6196
02:54:32,170 --> 02:54:34,540
But I feel like there's
everybody's the media now,

6197
02:54:34,860 --> 02:54:37,170
like there's so many different accesses,

6198
02:54:37,430 --> 02:54:39,210
so many points of access to trick them.

6199
02:54:39,220 --> 02:54:40,360
They still took them all day,

6200
02:54:40,820 --> 02:54:41,800
still tricking them all day.

6201
02:54:41,810 --> 02:54:42,010
Look,

6202
02:54:42,010 --> 02:54:43,320
we got Hillary on Jimmy saying,

6203
02:54:43,460 --> 02:54:44,380
wouldn't this be,

6204
02:54:44,710 --> 02:54:46,870
this could be someone's main
source of entertainment.

6205
02:54:46,871 --> 02:54:47,171
Slash,

6206
02:54:47,171 --> 02:54:50,920
news and this we would be at their
media and how would we be tricking them?

6207
02:54:51,040 --> 02:54:54,130
But what we're trying to do is we're
actually trying to tell the truth,

6208
02:54:54,131 --> 02:54:55,450
like we're trying to get to the truth.

6209
02:54:55,700 --> 02:54:55,990
Uh,

6210
02:54:55,990 --> 02:54:58,270
usually what you see in the media,

6211
02:54:58,300 --> 02:55:00,010
it has an agenda behind it.

6212
02:55:01,060 --> 02:55:01,850
Keep talking this through.

6213
02:55:01,850 --> 02:55:02,681
I don't have an agenda.

6214
02:55:02,681 --> 02:55:04,190
I'm not making money off conspiracy

6215
02:55:04,190 --> 02:55:04,791
theory money.

6216
02:55:04,791 --> 02:55:05,211
You know what I mean?

6217
02:55:05,211 --> 02:55:06,050
There's no agenda here.

6218
02:55:06,290 --> 02:55:08,000
So conspiracy theorist,

6219
02:55:08,150 --> 02:55:08,983
no matter how,

6220
02:55:08,990 --> 02:55:09,621
and by the way,

6221
02:55:09,621 --> 02:55:13,340
the CIA created the word conspiracy
theorist to demonize like people that are

6222
02:55:13,341 --> 02:55:14,570
against the establishment.

6223
02:55:14,720 --> 02:55:16,310
So that's not a conspiracy theory.

6224
02:55:16,370 --> 02:55:19,790
Can the word conspiracy theories to
make people seem like tin hat foil,

6225
02:55:20,090 --> 02:55:20,960
tin foil,

6226
02:55:20,961 --> 02:55:22,790
hat wearing Wackos.

6227
02:55:22,850 --> 02:55:23,683
But anyways,

6228
02:55:23,870 --> 02:55:24,703
um,

6229
02:55:24,980 --> 02:55:25,813
you know,

6230
02:55:25,910 --> 02:55:26,930
when you look at the motive,

6231
02:55:26,931 --> 02:55:29,900
like what's the motive behind
being a conspiracy theorist?

6232
02:55:30,170 --> 02:55:32,150
No matter how paranoid you are,

6233
02:55:32,600 --> 02:55:33,710
the most power,

6234
02:55:33,711 --> 02:55:34,490
noise,

6235
02:55:34,490 --> 02:55:37,430
worst case scenario type people when you,

6236
02:55:37,460 --> 02:55:37,990
you know,

6237
02:55:37,990 --> 02:55:38,210
you know,

6238
02:55:38,210 --> 02:55:41,690
some people are more paranoid than
others and they jumped a more conclusions

6239
02:55:41,691 --> 02:55:42,111
than others.

6240
02:55:42,111 --> 02:55:44,240
But all conspiracy theorists,

6241
02:55:44,510 --> 02:55:45,590
they have one thing in common.

6242
02:55:45,740 --> 02:55:46,573
They're not trying to,

6243
02:55:46,780 --> 02:55:47,140
uh,

6244
02:55:47,140 --> 02:55:49,310
they're worried about their family,

6245
02:55:49,311 --> 02:55:50,300
their health,

6246
02:55:50,570 --> 02:55:50,781
you know,

6247
02:55:50,781 --> 02:55:51,950
even if it is paranoia,

6248
02:55:51,951 --> 02:55:53,210
maybe they go too far.

6249
02:55:53,570 --> 02:55:54,403
It's,

6250
02:55:54,530 --> 02:55:55,151
it's what's,

6251
02:55:55,151 --> 02:55:55,360
it's,

6252
02:55:55,360 --> 02:55:56,360
it's what's in the heart.

6253
02:55:56,361 --> 02:55:59,900
We're concerned about the people and
what's going on and how we're being fooled

6254
02:55:59,901 --> 02:56:03,680
and where we're headed and where we're
led and all this bullshit that's going on

6255
02:56:03,681 --> 02:56:04,460
in the world.

6256
02:56:04,460 --> 02:56:05,690
We're concerned with that.

6257
02:56:05,930 --> 02:56:07,220
The people on the other side,

6258
02:56:07,910 --> 02:56:09,290
they're not concerned with that at all.

6259
02:56:09,890 --> 02:56:14,510
The people in power are not
concerned with the right thing.

6260
02:56:14,690 --> 02:56:17,600
They're concerned about one
thing and one thing only.

6261
02:56:17,601 --> 02:56:21,290
Keeping as much power as they
can for as long as possible.

6262
02:56:21,291 --> 02:56:22,730
And no matter what you see conspiracy.

6263
02:56:23,120 --> 02:56:24,170
I love it.

6264
02:56:25,850 --> 02:56:26,421
What are we talking about?

6265
02:56:26,421 --> 02:56:27,260
We're talking about like,

6266
02:56:27,840 --> 02:56:28,060
you know,

6267
02:56:28,060 --> 02:56:28,620
like I was,

6268
02:56:28,620 --> 02:56:29,130
I was at,

6269
02:56:29,130 --> 02:56:30,290
I was having a conversation,

6270
02:56:30,380 --> 02:56:32,800
I was having a conversation
about Alex Jones with my,

6271
02:56:32,830 --> 02:56:33,351
my buddy,

6272
02:56:33,351 --> 02:56:33,600
right?

6273
02:56:33,600 --> 02:56:34,520
Dawson who thinks like,

6274
02:56:34,700 --> 02:56:34,881
he's like,

6275
02:56:34,881 --> 02:56:35,780
he's just too paranoid.

6276
02:56:35,781 --> 02:56:36,350
He just,

6277
02:56:36,350 --> 02:56:36,741
he just,

6278
02:56:36,741 --> 02:56:37,670
he's just too crazy.

6279
02:56:37,670 --> 02:56:38,870
Just says the craziest things out.

6280
02:56:39,180 --> 02:56:39,650
I'm like,

6281
02:56:39,650 --> 02:56:40,341
yes he does.

6282
02:56:40,341 --> 02:56:41,300
I know him personally.

6283
02:56:41,301 --> 02:56:41,840
Yes.

6284
02:56:41,840 --> 02:56:45,200
He may be a little more um,

6285
02:56:45,290 --> 02:56:47,300
concerned slash paranoid,

6286
02:56:47,301 --> 02:56:47,421
you know,

6287
02:56:47,421 --> 02:56:48,080
he may be,

6288
02:56:48,080 --> 02:56:50,090
but that's why he's Alex Jones is he,

6289
02:56:50,330 --> 02:56:55,330
he show paranoid about shit that he
dedicated his life to try and to get

6290
02:56:56,601 --> 02:56:57,381
information out.

6291
02:56:57,381 --> 02:56:58,280
And some of it's wrong.

6292
02:56:58,281 --> 02:56:59,150
Some of it's right.

6293
02:56:59,480 --> 02:56:59,811
You know,

6294
02:56:59,811 --> 02:57:01,490
no conspiracy theorists Ha.

6295
02:57:01,520 --> 02:57:05,270
It's all theories based on
mostly circumstantial evidence.

6296
02:57:05,271 --> 02:57:06,620
It's not like raw real evidence.

6297
02:57:06,621 --> 02:57:07,280
We're just saying,

6298
02:57:07,280 --> 02:57:07,731
wait a minute,

6299
02:57:07,731 --> 02:57:12,620
you've got you guys done this before
and you've done this for forever and it

6300
02:57:12,621 --> 02:57:14,570
seems like it's happening
again based on that.

6301
02:57:14,571 --> 02:57:15,770
And based on that and based on this,

6302
02:57:16,000 --> 02:57:16,430
uh,

6303
02:57:16,430 --> 02:57:17,510
yeah,

6304
02:57:17,511 --> 02:57:19,640
you guys are probably
still doing this shit.

6305
02:57:19,880 --> 02:57:20,121
You know,

6306
02:57:20,121 --> 02:57:21,520
it's still the same criminals are look,

6307
02:57:21,560 --> 02:57:21,761
oh,

6308
02:57:21,761 --> 02:57:22,594
it's all good now.

6309
02:57:22,670 --> 02:57:22,851
Oh,

6310
02:57:22,851 --> 02:57:24,590
they used to do it after 50 years.

6311
02:57:24,591 --> 02:57:26,690
It's easy to prove a conspiracy theory.

6312
02:57:26,760 --> 02:57:28,430
What are we talking about exactly though?

6313
02:57:28,760 --> 02:57:29,780
We're talking about,

6314
02:57:29,900 --> 02:57:30,850
um,

6315
02:57:31,670 --> 02:57:32,810
we were talking about,

6316
02:57:34,790 --> 02:57:35,060
Oh,

6317
02:57:35,060 --> 02:57:35,810
Alex Jones,

6318
02:57:35,810 --> 02:57:36,643
Alex.

6319
02:57:37,520 --> 02:57:39,500
But it doesn't matter
that he's so paranoid.

6320
02:57:39,501 --> 02:57:40,940
He doesn't have to be
right about everything.

6321
02:57:40,941 --> 02:57:42,470
He's sometimes he's too paranoid,

6322
02:57:42,750 --> 02:57:45,470
but I'm talking about Alex
Jones is his heart's in it.

6323
02:57:45,650 --> 02:57:48,320
I know one thing about Alex
Jones is he's not a shill.

6324
02:57:48,440 --> 02:57:49,340
He's for real.

6325
02:57:49,780 --> 02:57:53,330
He maybe he stays away from
certain subjects getting all,

6326
02:57:53,340 --> 02:57:54,050
maybe,

6327
02:57:54,050 --> 02:57:54,801
maybe he does,

6328
02:57:54,801 --> 02:57:56,810
but overall the message is,

6329
02:57:57,170 --> 02:57:57,830
uh,

6330
02:57:57,830 --> 02:57:58,663
uh,

6331
02:57:58,670 --> 02:57:59,503
is,

6332
02:57:59,690 --> 02:57:59,900
well,

6333
02:57:59,900 --> 02:58:00,231
he sir,

6334
02:58:00,231 --> 02:58:00,650
don't,

6335
02:58:00,650 --> 02:58:02,370
don't buy

6336
02:58:02,370 --> 02:58:03,840
into this game,

6337
02:58:04,020 --> 02:58:05,650
this game show that,

6338
02:58:05,651 --> 02:58:06,630
that were being fed.

6339
02:58:06,780 --> 02:58:07,700
Don't buy into that.

6340
02:58:07,780 --> 02:58:08,370
Yes.

6341
02:58:08,370 --> 02:58:09,203
Yes.

6342
02:58:09,330 --> 02:58:10,380
And that's what's going on.

6343
02:58:10,590 --> 02:58:11,250
So I mean,

6344
02:58:11,250 --> 02:58:11,760
unless,

6345
02:58:11,760 --> 02:58:13,620
unless you're sitting me
sitting here telling me,

6346
02:58:13,621 --> 02:58:17,050
you believe what you see when
you see someone speaking and CNN,

6347
02:58:18,180 --> 02:58:18,870
do you think he would?

6348
02:58:18,870 --> 02:58:21,270
Do you think he believes
everything he's saying?

6349
02:58:21,700 --> 02:58:23,000
W what does it match?

6350
02:58:24,240 --> 02:58:27,920
There's people on ESPN that there's no
way they believe everything they show.

6351
02:58:27,940 --> 02:58:28,890
They used to be on ESPN,

6352
02:58:28,891 --> 02:58:29,660
I should say.

6353
02:58:29,660 --> 02:58:29,971
No Way.

6354
02:58:29,971 --> 02:58:32,520
They believe everything they're
saying cause it's contradicts itself.

6355
02:58:32,820 --> 02:58:34,860
When looked at what do
you mean guys in slack,

6356
02:58:34,861 --> 02:58:36,960
CNN broadcast on Espn,

6357
02:58:37,480 --> 02:58:42,120
just guys talking about sports will say
something very salacious and two days

6358
02:58:42,121 --> 02:58:44,100
later say something
that contradicts itself,

6359
02:58:44,490 --> 02:58:48,210
but they're just doing it because that's
their job and they're paid to talk all

6360
02:58:48,211 --> 02:58:48,750
day long.

6361
02:58:48,750 --> 02:58:49,583
Of course.

6362
02:58:50,030 --> 02:58:52,500
And that turned into other people
that like that are also paid.

6363
02:58:52,810 --> 02:58:53,700
The Alex Jones,

6364
02:58:54,190 --> 02:58:56,100
John Jones is completely independent.

6365
02:58:56,110 --> 02:58:58,780
Like I've known Alex literally for,

6366
02:58:58,840 --> 02:58:59,651
I hate literally,

6367
02:58:59,651 --> 02:59:04,120
but I've only known him since 99 and
he's always been like this and he's been

6368
02:59:04,121 --> 02:59:04,931
doing it himself,

6369
02:59:04,931 --> 02:59:06,760
doing his radio show and do it now.

6370
02:59:06,770 --> 02:59:09,200
Is Internet show he's getting paid to do.

6371
02:59:09,370 --> 02:59:10,203
Yeah.

6372
02:59:11,290 --> 02:59:11,830
Honestly,

6373
02:59:11,830 --> 02:59:13,750
if that dude had a fucking insurance job,

6374
02:59:13,751 --> 02:59:14,321
he'd spill it.

6375
02:59:14,321 --> 02:59:15,670
Still be talking about this stuff.

6376
02:59:15,790 --> 02:59:16,750
He talks about this stuff.

6377
02:59:18,470 --> 02:59:21,700
You could be at a honky tonk bar to
clock in the morning and it was the black

6378
02:59:21,701 --> 02:59:24,130
helicopters and the cattle
mutilations are connected.

6379
02:59:24,870 --> 02:59:28,060
You can't have one without
the guard that at all.

6380
02:59:29,320 --> 02:59:30,760
When you listen to him talk.

6381
02:59:31,500 --> 02:59:32,190
He did.

6382
02:59:32,190 --> 02:59:32,950
He's very,

6383
02:59:32,950 --> 02:59:33,940
he knows his shit.

6384
02:59:34,090 --> 02:59:34,923
He's not.

6385
02:59:34,990 --> 02:59:39,490
Sometimes he exaggerates on some shit
like a y two k exaggerate on that.

6386
02:59:39,500 --> 02:59:41,530
A lot of people thought
she was coming to an end.

6387
02:59:41,980 --> 02:59:43,270
We got a real one example.

6388
02:59:43,390 --> 02:59:44,081
Here's one example.

6389
02:59:44,081 --> 02:59:45,280
There was a problem though.

6390
02:59:45,281 --> 02:59:47,020
When you have a business of doom,

6391
02:59:47,350 --> 02:59:48,610
you're always looking for doom.

6392
02:59:48,910 --> 02:59:50,020
Like that's your business,

6393
02:59:50,170 --> 02:59:50,530
will they've,

6394
02:59:50,530 --> 02:59:51,311
you're selling doom,

6395
02:59:51,311 --> 02:59:52,150
you gotta look for doom.

6396
02:59:52,300 --> 02:59:54,010
It's not these not right a lot.

6397
02:59:54,100 --> 02:59:55,450
He's right about a lot of things.

6398
02:59:55,690 --> 02:59:59,530
Like he was right about a bunch of shit
that no one ever thought about that.

6399
02:59:59,531 --> 03:00:00,820
Now we think of as,

6400
03:00:01,570 --> 03:00:02,830
because of Edward Snowden,

6401
03:00:03,010 --> 03:00:06,210
we think of just as a part
of the problem that he was,

6402
03:00:06,211 --> 03:00:06,370
uh,

6403
03:00:06,370 --> 03:00:09,700
he was talking about worldwide
surveillance of emails,

6404
03:00:10,060 --> 03:00:14,800
emails and text messages and
he was talking about that
all the Lori time actions

6405
03:00:14,801 --> 03:00:15,581
on the inside.

6406
03:00:15,581 --> 03:00:16,590
He's got sources did,

6407
03:00:16,591 --> 03:00:17,470
he won't reveal their name.

6408
03:00:17,471 --> 03:00:18,700
He's getting a lot of information.

6409
03:00:18,701 --> 03:00:19,510
It's proven right.

6410
03:00:19,510 --> 03:00:23,200
He knows that we're living
in the goddamn matrix to,

6411
03:00:23,210 --> 03:00:28,210
if you believe the thing that Burns
me the most is super smart people,

6412
03:00:28,360 --> 03:00:29,230
really smart,

6413
03:00:29,710 --> 03:00:30,670
and they just,

6414
03:00:30,940 --> 03:00:34,030
they know the people running shit are,

6415
03:00:34,031 --> 03:00:35,130
are controlling us.

6416
03:00:35,270 --> 03:00:36,370
They know this.

6417
03:00:36,550 --> 03:00:37,300
But when,

6418
03:00:37,300 --> 03:00:41,080
when it comes down to
any topic they side with,

6419
03:00:41,530 --> 03:00:43,690
there were the criminals were that,

6420
03:00:44,020 --> 03:00:48,850
that burns me more than anything
is you know that criminals,

6421
03:00:48,940 --> 03:00:49,601
you know they are,

6422
03:00:49,601 --> 03:00:50,800
but you're going to side with them.

6423
03:00:50,801 --> 03:00:51,700
You're going to believe them.

6424
03:00:51,910 --> 03:00:53,530
You don't criminals.

6425
03:00:53,680 --> 03:00:55,120
They have to prove everything.

6426
03:00:55,180 --> 03:00:56,800
Maybe some things they're saying are true,

6427
03:00:57,010 --> 03:00:58,290
but I'm not going to believe you.

6428
03:00:58,291 --> 03:00:58,661
And I'm like,

6429
03:00:58,661 --> 03:00:59,530
I don't believe Shit.

6430
03:00:59,531 --> 03:01:00,010
You say just like

6431
03:01:00,010 --> 03:01:02,770
some fucking liar that you know
some dude at the comedy store,

6432
03:01:02,920 --> 03:01:04,660
some duty just lies
about fucking everything.

6433
03:01:04,780 --> 03:01:05,613
You're not going to believe,

6434
03:01:05,680 --> 03:01:07,450
even though some shit he's
telling you it might be true.

6435
03:01:07,451 --> 03:01:07,960
You're like,

6436
03:01:07,960 --> 03:01:11,530
you're going to have to prove all
that shit cause you fucking lie about

6437
03:01:11,531 --> 03:01:13,480
everything you lie
about where you're from.

6438
03:01:13,660 --> 03:01:15,400
You were never a wrestling champion.

6439
03:01:15,550 --> 03:01:16,730
You didn't fucking Oh no,

6440
03:01:16,731 --> 03:01:17,650
God Damn Harley,

6441
03:01:17,740 --> 03:01:18,580
you're a fucking liar.

6442
03:01:18,581 --> 03:01:20,530
Why am I going to
believe anything you say?

6443
03:01:20,680 --> 03:01:21,760
That's what's going on.

6444
03:01:21,920 --> 03:01:23,560
So I think we should,

6445
03:01:23,830 --> 03:01:25,270
when it comes to conspiracy theories,

6446
03:01:25,271 --> 03:01:26,020
we should,

6447
03:01:26,020 --> 03:01:26,500
we should,

6448
03:01:26,500 --> 03:01:31,110
we should always be at least skeptical
of the official story that may be true or

6449
03:01:31,120 --> 03:01:31,601
maybe not,

6450
03:01:31,601 --> 03:01:32,620
but I mean

6451
03:01:33,750 --> 03:01:38,430
was here right now and I'll put a tie
on him and a bat Mr. Official story.

6452
03:01:38,670 --> 03:01:39,870
Now you guys can Duke it out.

6453
03:01:40,140 --> 03:01:40,620
Yeah.

6454
03:01:40,620 --> 03:01:41,431
We don't need to do that.

6455
03:01:41,431 --> 03:01:41,731
I just,

6456
03:01:41,731 --> 03:01:44,040
I sat enough just like come on.

6457
03:01:44,041 --> 03:01:44,701
People are done.

6458
03:01:44,701 --> 03:01:45,660
Question everything.

6459
03:01:45,780 --> 03:01:46,141
Yeah.

6460
03:01:46,141 --> 03:01:49,710
At a certain point in time we
can't keep talking about this.

6461
03:01:50,840 --> 03:01:51,730
Uh,

6462
03:01:52,140 --> 03:01:53,670
what'd you think about um,

6463
03:01:54,000 --> 03:01:56,010
some other fights that were happening?

6464
03:01:57,210 --> 03:01:59,850
How bout trying steer this UFC fights.

6465
03:01:59,910 --> 03:02:04,260
Try to steer this away in this fucking
conspiracy swamp that we keep falling

6466
03:02:04,261 --> 03:02:05,094
into.

6467
03:02:05,800 --> 03:02:07,350
Non nonproductive.

6468
03:02:07,410 --> 03:02:10,530
The problem with that is
not opening people's minds.

6469
03:02:10,980 --> 03:02:11,910
It's not always right.

6470
03:02:12,630 --> 03:02:13,420
It's not always right.

6471
03:02:13,420 --> 03:02:14,550
There's a lot of stuff that's getting,

6472
03:02:14,820 --> 03:02:15,930
trying to get everything right.

6473
03:02:16,380 --> 03:02:16,651
Yeah.

6474
03:02:16,651 --> 03:02:18,930
But it's a giant quagmire.

6475
03:02:18,960 --> 03:02:22,920
Like if you start chasing down whether
or not the CA created Jim Morrison,

6476
03:02:22,921 --> 03:02:27,060
like that shit takes a lot of time
and hours and hours of speculation and

6477
03:02:27,061 --> 03:02:29,220
thinking it's not worth it.

6478
03:02:29,270 --> 03:02:30,670
Just like very inner smoke,

6479
03:02:30,680 --> 03:02:31,111
a joint,

6480
03:02:31,111 --> 03:02:31,770
enjoy the music.

6481
03:02:31,770 --> 03:02:32,780
It's very entertaining.

6482
03:02:32,830 --> 03:02:33,810
You feel like it's like,

6483
03:02:33,840 --> 03:02:36,640
it's almost like an open
ended puzzle that your plan

6484
03:02:37,720 --> 03:02:39,580
people are in the game of Thrones.

6485
03:02:39,581 --> 03:02:39,911
Totally.

6486
03:02:39,911 --> 03:02:41,620
It's not real at all.

6487
03:02:41,621 --> 03:02:43,930
It's a made up that story with all,

6488
03:02:43,931 --> 03:02:44,411
they get loud.

6489
03:02:44,411 --> 03:02:45,760
They wa I want some made up,

6490
03:02:45,820 --> 03:02:47,770
but they don't want to
watch like a documentary,

6491
03:02:47,920 --> 03:02:49,190
like a conspiracy documentary.

6492
03:02:49,191 --> 03:02:50,020
They maybe,

6493
03:02:50,020 --> 03:02:50,920
maybe not true.

6494
03:02:50,921 --> 03:02:51,700
Maybe exaggerated,

6495
03:02:51,700 --> 03:02:52,990
but God damn,

6496
03:02:53,170 --> 03:02:54,730
it's really bit,

6497
03:02:54,760 --> 03:02:56,950
it's close to the truth
and maybe it is true,

6498
03:02:57,220 --> 03:02:57,731
but no,

6499
03:02:57,731 --> 03:02:58,720
we ain't gonna Watch that.

6500
03:02:58,810 --> 03:03:01,240
We want to watch total fake shit.

6501
03:03:01,390 --> 03:03:03,030
I just want to make sure it's all thanks.

6502
03:03:03,070 --> 03:03:03,280
The

6503
03:03:03,280 --> 03:03:04,330
total fake shit.

6504
03:03:04,331 --> 03:03:08,380
At least like I don't feel stupid
because I know that it's fake.

6505
03:03:08,381 --> 03:03:09,190
I'm enjoying something.

6506
03:03:09,190 --> 03:03:12,320
I'm not being watched
conspiracy theories as it's it.

6507
03:03:12,440 --> 03:03:13,540
It's probably fake,

6508
03:03:13,541 --> 03:03:14,290
but who knows.

6509
03:03:14,290 --> 03:03:14,741
There may be.

6510
03:03:14,741 --> 03:03:16,270
There's a little too tight man.

6511
03:03:16,271 --> 03:03:17,260
Some of them are fun too.

6512
03:03:17,261 --> 03:03:17,530
You know.

6513
03:03:17,530 --> 03:03:21,010
My favorite one though was the one where
the dude thought that there was rod's

6514
03:03:21,011 --> 03:03:21,880
flying around.

6515
03:03:22,010 --> 03:03:22,370
Oh,

6516
03:03:22,370 --> 03:03:26,040
turned out just the way
camera's view can move faster.

6517
03:03:26,060 --> 03:03:28,180
Close that conspiracy
theory didn't last at all.

6518
03:03:28,410 --> 03:03:28,960
That's,

6519
03:03:28,960 --> 03:03:29,531
that's proof.

6520
03:03:29,531 --> 03:03:30,180
The conspiracy.

6521
03:03:30,180 --> 03:03:32,580
There's what was rotten
motherfuckers a little drop one.

6522
03:03:32,640 --> 03:03:33,760
Drop it hot dude.

6523
03:03:33,761 --> 03:03:34,420
It was drop.

6524
03:03:34,420 --> 03:03:34,680
No,

6525
03:03:34,680 --> 03:03:35,800
cause they're stuck with that.

6526
03:03:35,801 --> 03:03:39,160
It was a weird thing we saw
there was nobody wasn't dropped.

6527
03:03:39,220 --> 03:03:42,280
That guy came to one of my fucking
Q and A's and they believe that.

6528
03:03:42,281 --> 03:03:43,930
See people still believe that his,

6529
03:03:43,960 --> 03:03:45,490
the guy who made the documentary,

6530
03:03:45,491 --> 03:03:47,150
I think his name is Jose Escamia.

6531
03:03:47,300 --> 03:03:49,530
No gentlemen is a fine gentleman.

6532
03:03:49,531 --> 03:03:50,770
This is not a bad man at all.

6533
03:03:50,950 --> 03:03:52,720
But he came to one of the UFT,

6534
03:03:52,780 --> 03:03:55,720
see things and he waited in line to
ask me a question and he yelled it out.

6535
03:03:56,140 --> 03:03:57,440
The products that

6536
03:03:58,090 --> 03:03:58,620
I have done,

6537
03:03:58,620 --> 03:03:59,440
documentaries,

6538
03:03:59,440 --> 03:04:00,840
you have city of

6539
03:04:03,080 --> 03:04:05,600
that monster quest show
is what fucked him up.

6540
03:04:05,601 --> 03:04:06,434
Did you know that?

6541
03:04:06,860 --> 03:04:07,370
Yeah.

6542
03:04:07,370 --> 03:04:10,370
It was that monster quest show that show
that they were doing for the history

6543
03:04:10,371 --> 03:04:12,470
channel with the monsters?

6544
03:04:12,471 --> 03:04:12,621
No,

6545
03:04:12,621 --> 03:04:13,454
this is what happened.

6546
03:04:13,700 --> 03:04:16,700
Monster Quest did an
experiment on one side,

6547
03:04:16,790 --> 03:04:21,460
they used a high speed camera that does
like like very high rates of frame a

6548
03:04:21,500 --> 03:04:24,770
frame rates and he could
film like slow motion shit.

6549
03:04:24,771 --> 03:04:26,810
So you see like every
pixel it looks perfect.

6550
03:04:26,930 --> 03:04:29,090
You know they do that with
those slow mo cameras.

6551
03:04:29,360 --> 03:04:31,490
They could film at a
very high rate of speed,

6552
03:04:31,870 --> 03:04:36,870
like really calm kin next to it and then
next to it was a shitty camera and the

6553
03:04:36,891 --> 03:04:40,640
shitty camera couldn't capture a quick
enough so everything got elongated.

6554
03:04:40,641 --> 03:04:43,850
So the image got blurred and
elongated and it looks like tubes.

6555
03:04:44,000 --> 03:04:45,170
We're flying through the sky,

6556
03:04:45,320 --> 03:04:48,830
but two cameras side by side
captured completely different things.

6557
03:04:48,950 --> 03:04:51,140
One of them captured super obvious bugs.

6558
03:04:51,290 --> 03:04:52,670
He gets slowed down in slow motion.

6559
03:04:52,671 --> 03:04:55,700
You can see there are bugs and then it
would literally cross over into the other

6560
03:04:55,701 --> 03:04:58,790
camera and turn into this tube
because it was just moving too quick.

6561
03:04:58,820 --> 03:04:59,780
So it's an artifact.

6562
03:04:59,810 --> 03:05:00,643
It's what's called a,

6563
03:05:00,900 --> 03:05:02,850
that was a conspiracy theory that lasts.

6564
03:05:02,860 --> 03:05:05,850
That was hot for about maybe three years,

6565
03:05:05,980 --> 03:05:07,800
and then we even we even,

6566
03:05:07,830 --> 03:05:08,580
we were in debt.

6567
03:05:08,580 --> 03:05:09,690
I didn't really get high

6568
03:05:11,430 --> 03:05:12,263
shit.

6569
03:05:12,460 --> 03:05:14,760
There's fucking aliens
flying around everywhere.

6570
03:05:14,790 --> 03:05:16,110
We thought those were aliens.

6571
03:05:16,140 --> 03:05:16,771
They were alive.

6572
03:05:16,771 --> 03:05:17,101
They were like,

6573
03:05:17,101 --> 03:05:17,761
if these things,

6574
03:05:17,761 --> 03:05:19,110
they're invisible snakes.

6575
03:05:19,150 --> 03:05:22,400
I remember we were convinced that God,

6576
03:05:22,410 --> 03:05:23,520
there was no Twitter back then.

6577
03:05:23,521 --> 03:05:24,354
They would've,

6578
03:05:24,450 --> 03:05:25,830
they would've kept bringing that shit up.

6579
03:05:26,540 --> 03:05:29,730
So that's proof that if
we get debunked proof,

6580
03:05:30,180 --> 03:05:31,480
they were not like married to it.

6581
03:05:31,481 --> 03:05:32,520
I'm not married to that,

6582
03:05:32,720 --> 03:05:33,553
but

6583
03:05:34,620 --> 03:05:34,891
dude,

6584
03:05:34,891 --> 03:05:37,890
you can't see with your eyes it
and you need a video cam to see,

6585
03:05:38,100 --> 03:05:38,850
whoa.

6586
03:05:38,850 --> 03:05:41,940
We were thinking that like science
hadn't discovered and then the web,

6587
03:05:41,941 --> 03:05:43,650
but then you don't want
one time we were like,

6588
03:05:43,651 --> 03:05:44,490
where are the dead ones?

6589
03:05:45,240 --> 03:05:46,230
Where's all the dead ones?

6590
03:05:47,940 --> 03:05:49,410
Lion Fish live forever.

6591
03:05:49,440 --> 03:05:50,101
What if it's real?

6592
03:05:50,101 --> 03:05:50,491
I'm going to go,

6593
03:05:50,491 --> 03:05:52,020
I'm going to live rods.

6594
03:05:52,050 --> 03:05:52,680
Maybe.

6595
03:05:52,680 --> 03:05:55,440
Maybe that monstrous thing was bullshit.

6596
03:05:55,710 --> 03:05:56,543
I don't think so.

6597
03:05:56,550 --> 03:05:58,560
I'm pretty sure it's
going to be a rod guy.

6598
03:05:58,730 --> 03:06:01,820
But you imagine if you're the poor dude
who made that documentary and you've got

6599
03:06:01,821 --> 03:06:03,530
all this money invested in those rods.

6600
03:06:03,560 --> 03:06:05,180
I never hear anybody talking about raw.

6601
03:06:05,210 --> 03:06:05,441
No,

6602
03:06:05,441 --> 03:06:06,040
they're done.

6603
03:06:06,040 --> 03:06:07,540
Someone did come up to me and say,

6604
03:06:07,690 --> 03:06:08,490
Hey,

6605
03:06:08,490 --> 03:06:09,323
uh,

6606
03:06:09,330 --> 03:06:12,340
if you heard that conspiracy
theory where there's no forests,

6607
03:06:13,060 --> 03:06:13,893
have you heard about this?

6608
03:06:14,410 --> 03:06:16,960
There's a conspiracy theory
where there's no chorus.

6609
03:06:17,740 --> 03:06:18,573
Look into it.

6610
03:06:18,850 --> 03:06:19,450
No,

6611
03:06:19,450 --> 03:06:20,221
no forest.

6612
03:06:20,221 --> 03:06:21,580
I bet you love these things.

6613
03:06:21,581 --> 03:06:21,851
I'm like,

6614
03:06:21,851 --> 03:06:22,690
I don't know what that is.

6615
03:06:22,691 --> 03:06:22,961
Really.

6616
03:06:22,961 --> 03:06:23,510
I didn't even look,

6617
03:06:23,510 --> 03:06:28,510
I watched 30 seconds cause someone in
class told me Ziggy came across hip.

6618
03:06:28,700 --> 03:06:30,150
You're at that conspiracy
theory about Noah.

6619
03:06:30,170 --> 03:06:31,003
I go,

6620
03:06:31,120 --> 03:06:31,890
what?

6621
03:06:31,890 --> 03:06:35,920
Cause I went home and I put no
forest and I was 13 seconds.

6622
03:06:36,090 --> 03:06:37,170
I just stopped it.

6623
03:06:38,740 --> 03:06:41,800
Have you seen the one with this due to
the dinosaurs aren't real and we've seen

6624
03:06:41,801 --> 03:06:43,900
that one that I don't,

6625
03:06:43,980 --> 03:06:45,280
that I don't know.

6626
03:06:45,460 --> 03:06:46,293
I don't know.

6627
03:06:46,390 --> 03:06:48,220
That's like some other
shit where I'm like,

6628
03:06:48,221 --> 03:06:50,230
I don't believe any science.

6629
03:06:50,290 --> 03:06:52,270
I don't believe in the early science.

6630
03:06:52,271 --> 03:06:53,270
I believe it is.

6631
03:06:53,950 --> 03:06:55,180
You Rub two sticks together.

6632
03:06:55,260 --> 03:06:56,090
There's fire.

6633
03:06:56,090 --> 03:06:56,923
Other than that,

6634
03:06:57,180 --> 03:06:58,300
you've got to prove that shit.

6635
03:06:59,360 --> 03:07:00,540
I'm going to ignore that shit.

6636
03:07:01,920 --> 03:07:04,470
All you gotta just tobacco science.

6637
03:07:04,471 --> 03:07:04,931
What about that,

6638
03:07:04,931 --> 03:07:06,000
that you think that Shit's gone?

6639
03:07:06,030 --> 03:07:08,550
You think tobacco science
has gone stronger than ever?

6640
03:07:08,610 --> 03:07:11,430
That's the one of the weirdest
thing was tobacco science.

6641
03:07:12,240 --> 03:07:14,220
Things that politicians don't talk about.

6642
03:07:14,370 --> 03:07:17,670
If you really stop and think about all
the threats they talk about to this

6643
03:07:17,671 --> 03:07:19,470
country and the people in our health,

6644
03:07:20,070 --> 03:07:21,780
and they'll even discuss drugs,

6645
03:07:22,290 --> 03:07:27,290
but how alcohol kills way more people
than illegal drugs and for sure cigarettes

6646
03:07:30,031 --> 03:07:31,740
kill way more people than alcohol.

6647
03:07:32,040 --> 03:07:37,040
And so you'll occasionally hear a
politician discuss underage drinking or

6648
03:07:38,191 --> 03:07:39,750
drinking and driving,

6649
03:07:40,050 --> 03:07:45,050
but will they ever discuss abstinence
like [inaudible] and professing their hope

6650
03:07:45,271 --> 03:07:46,140
for abstinence?

6651
03:07:46,320 --> 03:07:47,850
No fucking way.

6652
03:07:48,010 --> 03:07:50,640
You mean one alcohol from alcohol.

6653
03:07:51,200 --> 03:07:51,920
Okay.

6654
03:07:51,920 --> 03:07:55,250
If they never got to
propose that right there.

6655
03:07:55,290 --> 03:07:57,000
Definitely never going
to talk about cigarettes.

6656
03:07:57,001 --> 03:08:00,270
Cigarettes is their dirty friend that
murders the giant elephant in the fucking

6657
03:08:00,271 --> 03:08:00,870
sky.

6658
03:08:00,870 --> 03:08:03,960
They got a dirty friend
that kills 500,000 people.

6659
03:08:03,970 --> 03:08:08,970
A clear example of why you
should be a conspiracy theory.

6660
03:08:10,050 --> 03:08:13,050
That is absolutely fascinating conspiracy.

6661
03:08:13,080 --> 03:08:16,350
That's a fascinating space and
no one says shit in your face.

6662
03:08:16,380 --> 03:08:16,621
No one,

6663
03:08:16,621 --> 03:08:17,700
no one even talks about it.

6664
03:08:17,701 --> 03:08:18,420
Nobody talks about it.

6665
03:08:18,420 --> 03:08:18,840
You know what?

6666
03:08:18,840 --> 03:08:22,950
Anytime I'm on board with know
there's gotta be some money in there.

6667
03:08:22,951 --> 03:08:23,400
So

6668
03:08:23,400 --> 03:08:23,580
Miss,

6669
03:08:23,580 --> 03:08:24,600
this is me guessing.

6670
03:08:24,690 --> 03:08:25,440
I know this.

6671
03:08:25,440 --> 03:08:28,050
I know that sometimes greed,

6672
03:08:28,560 --> 03:08:33,560
greed will actually result in
something beneficial to mankind.

6673
03:08:33,960 --> 03:08:35,340
Sometimes it does.

6674
03:08:35,460 --> 03:08:36,420
In one instance,

6675
03:08:36,720 --> 03:08:38,520
a seatbelt laws,

6676
03:08:38,670 --> 03:08:39,570
seatbelt laws.

6677
03:08:39,630 --> 03:08:42,600
It looks like government was trying to
take care of us and they really were

6678
03:08:42,601 --> 03:08:43,560
concerned with our health.

6679
03:08:43,770 --> 03:08:47,560
But when you looked into the seat belt
law and the helmet law for motorcycles in

6680
03:08:47,561 --> 03:08:48,394
California,

6681
03:08:48,480 --> 03:08:52,350
it was the insurance
company's paying for all that,

6682
03:08:52,560 --> 03:08:52,890
uh,

6683
03:08:52,890 --> 03:08:55,980
the bill because they
thought it was cheaper.

6684
03:08:56,460 --> 03:08:57,480
You know what if you didn't have,

6685
03:08:57,520 --> 03:09:00,290
if you got an accident and you
weren't wearing your seatbelt,

6686
03:09:00,420 --> 03:09:00,630
you,

6687
03:09:00,630 --> 03:09:02,010
if you'd turned into a vegetable,

6688
03:09:02,040 --> 03:09:03,210
you're expensive.

6689
03:09:03,360 --> 03:09:07,590
All those accidents with no seat belts
were costing these insurance companies

6690
03:09:07,591 --> 03:09:08,424
Kazillions.

6691
03:09:08,490 --> 03:09:13,380
So it was better to make them wear seat
belts then it wasn't as expensive to pay

6692
03:09:13,381 --> 03:09:14,214
for these bills.

6693
03:09:14,260 --> 03:09:14,580
They don't wait.

6694
03:09:14,580 --> 03:09:16,830
They don't have as many as
many vegetable bills and shit.

6695
03:09:17,160 --> 03:09:17,701
Overall,

6696
03:09:17,701 --> 03:09:20,220
it makes sense so that
when you find that out,

6697
03:09:20,430 --> 03:09:21,450
I'm just guessing here,

6698
03:09:21,451 --> 03:09:24,240
when you see those tobacco
commercials where the,

6699
03:09:24,241 --> 03:09:26,010
I've seen the latest tobacco
commercial with some,

6700
03:09:26,130 --> 03:09:28,770
some African American girl who's like,

6701
03:09:28,830 --> 03:09:30,090
she's wrapping poetry,

6702
03:09:30,091 --> 03:09:30,900
no music,

6703
03:09:30,900 --> 03:09:33,220
and it's all like being
super ultra street.

6704
03:09:33,221 --> 03:09:34,054
She's in an alley.

6705
03:09:34,140 --> 03:09:34,770
She's like,

6706
03:09:34,770 --> 03:09:35,310
you know,

6707
03:09:35,310 --> 03:09:35,910
I don't,

6708
03:09:35,910 --> 03:09:38,130
all I do is just go out
there and do my thing.

6709
03:09:38,190 --> 03:09:39,030
I ain't going to smoke.

6710
03:09:39,060 --> 03:09:39,871
I'm going to do that.

6711
03:09:39,871 --> 03:09:40,380
Dang.

6712
03:09:40,380 --> 03:09:40,591
You know,

6713
03:09:40,591 --> 03:09:42,440
just talk stupid rat.

6714
03:09:42,480 --> 03:09:43,313
Not Stupid rap,

6715
03:09:43,350 --> 03:09:44,000
but just,

6716
03:09:44,000 --> 03:09:44,840
I picked that back.

6717
03:09:46,200 --> 03:09:47,840
It was amazing rap.

6718
03:09:48,210 --> 03:09:49,210
It was amazing work,

6719
03:09:49,530 --> 03:09:50,970
but it was all about not smoking.

6720
03:09:51,000 --> 03:09:51,780
I'm cool.

6721
03:09:51,780 --> 03:09:52,613
I'm not going to smoke.

6722
03:09:52,680 --> 03:09:53,300
I'm a,

6723
03:09:53,300 --> 03:09:54,080
I'm in the street.

6724
03:09:54,080 --> 03:09:54,913
Yo.

6725
03:09:56,020 --> 03:09:56,950
I'm just guessing.

6726
03:09:57,160 --> 03:09:57,993
I'm just guessing.

6727
03:09:58,090 --> 03:09:59,170
I bet if you look into that,

6728
03:09:59,260 --> 03:10:00,100
it's the same thing.

6729
03:10:00,250 --> 03:10:03,430
I bet the insurance companies
have figured out that uh,

6730
03:10:03,610 --> 03:10:03,731
uh,

6731
03:10:03,731 --> 03:10:07,030
diseases from smoking
are expensive as fuck.

6732
03:10:07,090 --> 03:10:08,050
We got to stop this.

6733
03:10:08,110 --> 03:10:09,250
This is crushing us.

6734
03:10:09,280 --> 03:10:10,270
That's me guessing.

6735
03:10:10,390 --> 03:10:11,260
I don't know.

6736
03:10:11,440 --> 03:10:14,330
But do they really care if we smoke pot?

6737
03:10:14,350 --> 03:10:14,860
No.

6738
03:10:14,860 --> 03:10:17,110
Why is this on and must be some,

6739
03:10:17,320 --> 03:10:18,700
you must be able to follow the money.

6740
03:10:18,760 --> 03:10:19,750
That's me guessing,

6741
03:10:20,080 --> 03:10:21,310
but of course I'm wrong.

6742
03:10:21,560 --> 03:10:22,150
Well,

6743
03:10:22,150 --> 03:10:22,831
there's definitely,

6744
03:10:22,831 --> 03:10:22,950
yeah,

6745
03:10:22,950 --> 03:10:24,630
billions of dollars in cigarettes.

6746
03:10:24,690 --> 03:10:25,650
I think about people,

6747
03:10:25,651 --> 03:10:29,850
they buy so many cigarettes over the
world to shut that business down.

6748
03:10:30,390 --> 03:10:31,650
You've got a real problem.

6749
03:10:31,760 --> 03:10:31,951
I mean,

6750
03:10:31,951 --> 03:10:35,820
there's a lot of people invested in
that business is distribution companies.

6751
03:10:35,821 --> 03:10:37,500
There's people that make those things.

6752
03:10:37,501 --> 03:10:41,160
There's people that like those things
and he'd get to get them the dark market.

6753
03:10:41,220 --> 03:10:43,320
They're going to figure out a way
how to get them the dark market,

6754
03:10:43,350 --> 03:10:44,183
the black market,

6755
03:10:44,420 --> 03:10:47,100
but you can't make things illegal because
you can't tell people what they can

6756
03:10:47,101 --> 03:10:47,880
and can't do.

6757
03:10:47,880 --> 03:10:49,320
If somebody wants to smoke cigarettes,

6758
03:10:49,650 --> 03:10:50,580
they should be allowed to,

6759
03:10:50,820 --> 03:10:54,900
but it's just real weird that the
government professes to care about us,

6760
03:10:54,901 --> 03:10:58,260
but doesn't bring up this one thing
that kills a half a million people every

6761
03:10:58,260 --> 03:10:59,340
year in this country alone.

6762
03:10:59,550 --> 03:11:00,540
Millions,

6763
03:11:00,540 --> 03:11:01,120
millions worldwide.

6764
03:11:01,120 --> 03:11:03,310
One cool thing that that was another law,

6765
03:11:03,311 --> 03:11:07,060
the cigarette law where
you couldn't smoke inside.

6766
03:11:07,300 --> 03:11:09,190
That was one of those fucking laws.

6767
03:11:09,191 --> 03:11:11,080
It was beneficial for humanity.

6768
03:11:11,100 --> 03:11:11,350
Right.

6769
03:11:11,350 --> 03:11:13,430
But was rooted in mining.

6770
03:11:13,680 --> 03:11:13,870
Right.

6771
03:11:13,870 --> 03:11:14,703
Somehow it just,

6772
03:11:14,710 --> 03:11:17,140
it just turned out that it was
actually a good thing for us.

6773
03:11:17,290 --> 03:11:18,400
Helmets are good thing.

6774
03:11:18,460 --> 03:11:19,750
Seatbelts are great thing.

6775
03:11:19,930 --> 03:11:20,660
You don't want people like,

6776
03:11:20,660 --> 03:11:20,980
ah,

6777
03:11:20,980 --> 03:11:21,290
people who,

6778
03:11:21,290 --> 03:11:22,123
people that say,

6779
03:11:22,150 --> 03:11:24,730
I don't want the government telling
me I have to put a seatbelt on.

6780
03:11:24,760 --> 03:11:25,960
If I didn't want to wear a seatbelt,

6781
03:11:26,050 --> 03:11:26,351
I go,

6782
03:11:26,351 --> 03:11:26,950
dude,

6783
03:11:26,950 --> 03:11:28,030
if you don't wear a seatbelt,

6784
03:11:28,090 --> 03:11:29,030
you get an accident.

6785
03:11:29,031 --> 03:11:30,160
He turned into a vegetable,

6786
03:11:30,310 --> 03:11:31,143
you're fucking,

6787
03:11:31,390 --> 03:11:34,180
you're going to have people that you
love that I'd have to wipe your ass.

6788
03:11:34,181 --> 03:11:34,990
You want to put them,

6789
03:11:34,990 --> 03:11:38,620
put a fucking seatbelt on so then
I have to wipe your ass dude.

6790
03:11:38,680 --> 03:11:39,513
You know what I mean?

6791
03:11:39,550 --> 03:11:40,480
Take care of yourself.

6792
03:11:41,290 --> 03:11:41,770
Yeah.

6793
03:11:41,770 --> 03:11:42,730
You know what I'm talking about?

6794
03:11:42,740 --> 03:11:42,960
Yeah.

6795
03:11:42,960 --> 03:11:43,120
No,

6796
03:11:43,120 --> 03:11:43,720
definitely.

6797
03:11:43,720 --> 03:11:45,550
So safer to wear a seatbelt for sure.

6798
03:11:45,551 --> 03:11:48,820
It's safer to have a very big sturdy car.

6799
03:11:49,570 --> 03:11:51,970
There's a lot of safers most likely.

6800
03:11:52,870 --> 03:11:53,703
But uh,

6801
03:11:53,710 --> 03:11:53,951
yeah,

6802
03:11:53,951 --> 03:11:54,280
it's,

6803
03:11:54,280 --> 03:11:54,581
it's,

6804
03:11:54,581 --> 03:11:55,414
um,

6805
03:11:55,780 --> 03:11:56,260
it's,

6806
03:11:56,260 --> 03:11:56,710
it's weird

6807
03:11:56,710 --> 03:12:00,000
because I'm a believer that people
should have personal freedom.

6808
03:12:00,060 --> 03:12:01,170
You should be able to
do whatever you want.

6809
03:12:01,440 --> 03:12:03,840
But I think that when it
comes to like young kids,

6810
03:12:04,050 --> 03:12:07,890
they're too likely to do stupid
shit if you allow them to and cars.

6811
03:12:07,891 --> 03:12:08,370
It's a,

6812
03:12:08,370 --> 03:12:09,300
it's a one mistake,

6813
03:12:09,301 --> 03:12:11,010
stupid shit and you're fucked up for life.

6814
03:12:11,011 --> 03:12:11,880
It's not worth it.

6815
03:12:12,300 --> 03:12:14,460
We should enforce it in any way we can,

6816
03:12:14,670 --> 03:12:17,130
but that's sort of the same
way I feel about cigarettes.

6817
03:12:17,131 --> 03:12:19,530
Like we should kind of figure
out how to enforce that.

6818
03:12:19,970 --> 03:12:22,920
Like that's not a smart
thing to get involved with.

6819
03:12:23,350 --> 03:12:26,890
Would you be opposed to a
law that made it illegal?

6820
03:12:27,070 --> 03:12:27,940
Seriously illegal?

6821
03:12:27,941 --> 03:12:28,061
No,

6822
03:12:28,061 --> 03:12:28,181
no,

6823
03:12:28,181 --> 03:12:28,301
no,

6824
03:12:28,301 --> 03:12:28,510
no,

6825
03:12:28,510 --> 03:12:28,661
no.

6826
03:12:28,661 --> 03:12:29,480
There's something else,

6827
03:12:29,480 --> 03:12:29,710
uh,

6828
03:12:29,710 --> 03:12:34,710
illegal to be paid to paint
all day to go out and,

6829
03:12:35,540 --> 03:12:35,820
and,

6830
03:12:35,820 --> 03:12:36,071
and,

6831
03:12:36,071 --> 03:12:36,390
uh,

6832
03:12:36,390 --> 03:12:36,610
uh,

6833
03:12:36,610 --> 03:12:37,060
us,

6834
03:12:37,060 --> 03:12:37,190
uh,

6835
03:12:37,190 --> 03:12:39,550
spew propaganda on a certain subject.

6836
03:12:39,880 --> 03:12:40,210
You,

6837
03:12:40,210 --> 03:12:41,980
would you vote on a law?

6838
03:12:42,340 --> 03:12:44,140
Would you pass a law to make that illegal?

6839
03:12:44,690 --> 03:12:45,523
I'm confused.

6840
03:12:45,790 --> 03:12:46,331
To be illegal,

6841
03:12:46,331 --> 03:12:48,320
to pay someone to get

6842
03:12:50,290 --> 03:12:51,790
to lie on it should be,

6843
03:12:51,800 --> 03:12:52,730
I should be illegal.

6844
03:12:52,731 --> 03:12:53,090
Right.

6845
03:12:53,090 --> 03:12:55,310
Especially if it's a government
that save a lot of things.

6846
03:12:55,400 --> 03:12:56,060
Anybody.

6847
03:12:56,060 --> 03:13:01,060
If it was a serious crime to get paid
to get online and spew propaganda,

6848
03:13:02,600 --> 03:13:03,800
I think everybody would say,

6849
03:13:03,801 --> 03:13:04,590
yeah,

6850
03:13:04,590 --> 03:13:05,000
that would,

6851
03:13:05,000 --> 03:13:06,080
that should be really illegal.

6852
03:13:06,140 --> 03:13:08,690
It should be really illegal
for a company to pay someone,

6853
03:13:08,780 --> 03:13:09,850
so if you were going to do that,

6854
03:13:09,851 --> 03:13:12,040
that'd be some underground
black market shit.

6855
03:13:12,041 --> 03:13:14,990
We're going to give you an envelope with
fucking $2,000 we need to get shit in

6856
03:13:14,991 --> 03:13:15,291
the fucking,

6857
03:13:15,291 --> 03:13:16,101
here's the online,

6858
03:13:16,101 --> 03:13:17,090
you've got to Ip address,

6859
03:13:17,210 --> 03:13:18,043
you got to run.

6860
03:13:18,230 --> 03:13:18,681
You know what I mean?

6861
03:13:18,681 --> 03:13:20,540
That's gotta be super illegal to do that.

6862
03:13:20,541 --> 03:13:20,850
Right.

6863
03:13:20,850 --> 03:13:21,120
Okay.

6864
03:13:21,120 --> 03:13:23,810
I think it's too easy because
everyone's talking about,

6865
03:13:23,960 --> 03:13:24,081
oh,

6866
03:13:24,081 --> 03:13:24,710
the internet,

6867
03:13:24,710 --> 03:13:26,180
there's so much information out there.

6868
03:13:26,181 --> 03:13:27,260
We can find the truth,

6869
03:13:27,380 --> 03:13:28,970
but also it works against you.

6870
03:13:28,971 --> 03:13:29,301
Yes,

6871
03:13:29,301 --> 03:13:30,230
you can find the truth,

6872
03:13:30,410 --> 03:13:35,410
but you could also get strategically
flooded with misinformation strategically,

6873
03:13:35,781 --> 03:13:36,950
and that's a companies are doing,

6874
03:13:37,100 --> 03:13:42,050
they will strategically hire people to
sway opinion and then and then and then

6875
03:13:42,051 --> 03:13:45,350
put it under science daily.com or science,

6876
03:13:45,390 --> 03:13:46,280
whatever.com

6877
03:13:46,890 --> 03:13:50,650
that's been confirmed that that's
been done with climate climate change.

6878
03:13:51,460 --> 03:13:52,600
You seen that documentary?

6879
03:13:52,601 --> 03:13:53,470
Merchants of doubt.

6880
03:13:54,190 --> 03:13:55,120
It's really interesting.

6881
03:13:55,150 --> 03:13:58,120
It's about a bunch of guys who
get paid and it coincidentally,

6882
03:13:58,121 --> 03:13:59,830
this two subjects are actually connected.

6883
03:14:00,010 --> 03:14:02,470
They used to get paid for going on.

6884
03:14:02,471 --> 03:14:07,450
These talk shows and disputing the fact
that cigarettes are addictive and that

6885
03:14:07,451 --> 03:14:08,980
cigarettes caused health problems.

6886
03:14:08,981 --> 03:14:09,970
He would dispute these things.

6887
03:14:09,971 --> 03:14:13,420
How many shows that they were doing it
in like the seventies and the eighties

6888
03:14:13,850 --> 03:14:14,650
tobacco science.

6889
03:14:14,650 --> 03:14:14,980
Yeah,

6890
03:14:14,980 --> 03:14:19,980
and so then these guys from then then
went to climate change later in life.

6891
03:14:20,560 --> 03:14:24,760
The same people are trying to debunk
climate change and they have these,

6892
03:14:24,761 --> 03:14:26,140
these things where they'll,

6893
03:14:26,470 --> 03:14:31,470
they'll show the same people that were
involved in trying to debunk cigarettes

6894
03:14:31,990 --> 03:14:34,570
causing cancer and being addictive.

6895
03:14:34,690 --> 03:14:38,230
The same exact people were trying to
say climate change is just a cycle.

6896
03:14:38,350 --> 03:14:39,340
It just the way it is.

6897
03:14:39,341 --> 03:14:40,540
It's always going to be this way.

6898
03:14:40,830 --> 03:14:41,550
Do you,

6899
03:14:41,550 --> 03:14:42,270
do you,

6900
03:14:42,270 --> 03:14:43,820
do you think that is a,

6901
03:14:43,830 --> 03:14:46,740
a sign that something fishy is going on?

6902
03:14:46,770 --> 03:14:46,861
Oh,

6903
03:14:46,861 --> 03:14:47,370
for sure.

6904
03:14:47,370 --> 03:14:47,890
Of course.

6905
03:14:47,890 --> 03:14:48,040
What?

6906
03:14:48,040 --> 03:14:49,410
That's like basic detective shit.

6907
03:14:49,530 --> 03:14:49,720
Well,

6908
03:14:49,720 --> 03:14:50,730
and they're using these,

6909
03:14:50,790 --> 03:14:51,300
what's going on,

6910
03:14:51,300 --> 03:14:52,133
Jamie?

6911
03:14:52,470 --> 03:14:53,430
You guys are talking about this.

6912
03:14:53,431 --> 03:14:54,110
I just Google it.

6913
03:14:54,110 --> 03:14:55,700
Put the propaganda ban being lifted.

6914
03:14:55,730 --> 03:14:55,841
Oh,

6915
03:14:55,841 --> 03:14:57,300
I thought you were talking
about Mickey Rourke.

6916
03:14:57,301 --> 03:14:57,451
No,

6917
03:14:57,451 --> 03:14:57,570
no,

6918
03:14:57,570 --> 03:14:57,690
no.

6919
03:14:57,690 --> 03:14:59,170
Make your work plan on two screens here.

6920
03:14:59,171 --> 03:15:02,880
And he's screaming at people and they
keep showing me who wrote this article.

6921
03:15:04,110 --> 03:15:04,950
That's Mickey Rourke.

6922
03:15:05,010 --> 03:15:05,910
Have you seen him lately?

6923
03:15:06,000 --> 03:15:06,833
Oh Shit.

6924
03:15:06,930 --> 03:15:07,763
He's uh,

6925
03:15:07,830 --> 03:15:12,830
he's gotten very weird congressman seek
to lift propaganda ban happened in the

6926
03:15:12,961 --> 03:15:13,471
NDA,

6927
03:15:13,471 --> 03:15:15,710
but Michael Hastings is
the one that was right.

6928
03:15:15,780 --> 03:15:16,470
Oh my God.

6929
03:15:16,470 --> 03:15:17,970
Propaganda was supposed to target.

6930
03:15:18,000 --> 03:15:21,660
Foreigners can now be aimed at
Americans reversing a longstanding,

6931
03:15:21,690 --> 03:15:22,051
something,

6932
03:15:22,051 --> 03:15:22,381
something,

6933
03:15:22,381 --> 03:15:22,831
something.

6934
03:15:22,831 --> 03:15:23,790
Can you scroll up?

6935
03:15:24,360 --> 03:15:25,193
It's okay.

6936
03:15:25,740 --> 03:15:26,573
What you said about it.

6937
03:15:26,640 --> 03:15:27,510
Oh my God.

6938
03:15:27,511 --> 03:15:29,550
It's called the Smith modernization.

6939
03:15:29,640 --> 03:15:29,911
The new,

6940
03:15:29,911 --> 03:15:33,870
what would give the new law would give
sweeping powers to State Department and

6941
03:15:33,871 --> 03:15:35,040
Pentagon is pushed television,

6942
03:15:35,041 --> 03:15:35,341
radio,

6943
03:15:35,341 --> 03:15:35,751
newspaper,

6944
03:15:35,751 --> 03:15:37,980
and social media onto the US public.

6945
03:15:37,980 --> 03:15:40,000
It removes the protection for Americans.

6946
03:15:40,001 --> 03:15:41,190
Has a Pentagon official,

6947
03:15:41,700 --> 03:15:42,420
uh,

6948
03:15:42,420 --> 03:15:44,040
who is concerned about the law.

6949
03:15:44,280 --> 03:15:48,840
It removes oversight from the people
who want to put out this information.

6950
03:15:48,841 --> 03:15:50,700
There no checks and balances.

6951
03:15:50,910 --> 03:15:55,350
No one knows if the information is
accurate or partially accurate or entirely

6952
03:15:55,351 --> 03:15:55,741
false.

6953
03:15:55,741 --> 03:15:56,940
That's so crazy.

6954
03:15:57,300 --> 03:16:02,300
That is so fucking crazy that they just
try to make bills where they will out

6955
03:16:03,721 --> 03:16:05,410
and out lie about things.

6956
03:16:05,411 --> 03:16:10,170
So that's your strategy for dealing with
terror is to create a feeling of total

6957
03:16:10,171 --> 03:16:11,520
imbalance in this country.

6958
03:16:12,180 --> 03:16:14,130
Like whether or not it's effective or not.

6959
03:16:14,131 --> 03:16:16,950
Like as far as a long
term strategy for freedom,

6960
03:16:17,160 --> 03:16:20,460
it's one of the worst ideas ever to say.

6961
03:16:20,580 --> 03:16:22,950
We as your elders,

6962
03:16:22,951 --> 03:16:25,140
your daddy and mommy of the government.

6963
03:16:25,141 --> 03:16:28,710
We're going to look over you and we're
going to tell you about Santa Claus and

6964
03:16:28,711 --> 03:16:30,480
the Easter bunny and we're going to just,

6965
03:16:30,500 --> 03:16:31,800
we're just gonna make shit up.

6966
03:16:31,830 --> 03:16:35,160
We're going to make shit up for it all
up and we think we should be able to

6967
03:16:35,161 --> 03:16:36,910
because we know better than you because,

6968
03:16:36,911 --> 03:16:37,080
uh,

6969
03:16:37,080 --> 03:16:39,120
we were elected allegedly.

6970
03:16:39,340 --> 03:16:40,110
That's what's gone well,

6971
03:16:40,110 --> 03:16:41,600
we have the information
that he brought up.

6972
03:16:43,140 --> 03:16:44,790
Science daily.com.

6973
03:16:44,940 --> 03:16:45,480
Shit.

6974
03:16:45,480 --> 03:16:46,313
If you look at that,

6975
03:16:46,320 --> 03:16:47,310
they got the truth there.

6976
03:16:47,311 --> 03:16:48,420
That's it's right there.

6977
03:16:48,421 --> 03:16:49,254
It's a science.

6978
03:16:49,330 --> 03:16:51,940
Did you see what happened with um,

6979
03:16:51,970 --> 03:16:53,620
that fucking doctor drew show?

6980
03:16:54,070 --> 03:16:57,820
Dr Drew talked the other day about
Hillary Clinton having a brain injury.

6981
03:16:58,060 --> 03:17:02,590
He talked about it on TV and what her
brain injury was and how dangerous it was,

6982
03:17:02,591 --> 03:17:03,640
what she was taking.

6983
03:17:03,820 --> 03:17:07,420
And he didn't agree with her treatment
and they canceled his fucking show.

6984
03:17:11,080 --> 03:17:12,310
Canceled his fucking show.

6985
03:17:12,840 --> 03:17:13,411
Doctor drew.

6986
03:17:13,411 --> 03:17:17,500
So canceled days after host gives negative
speculation about Hillary Clinton's

6987
03:17:17,501 --> 03:17:17,980
health.

6988
03:17:17,980 --> 03:17:19,150
Are you shocked or something?

6989
03:17:19,151 --> 03:17:19,530
Dude,

6990
03:17:19,530 --> 03:17:20,890
I'm dying all the time.

6991
03:17:21,040 --> 03:17:22,590
Did you know insane?

6992
03:17:22,700 --> 03:17:24,020
Like this is some wide open.

6993
03:17:24,021 --> 03:17:24,330
Yeah.

6994
03:17:24,330 --> 03:17:27,390
Did you know how many
astronauts died in 1968.

6995
03:17:28,570 --> 03:17:29,403
Two,

6996
03:17:29,590 --> 03:17:30,423
eight

6997
03:17:30,560 --> 03:17:31,940
and then two more in 69.

6998
03:17:31,970 --> 03:17:34,220
What happened when they are
doing fine in this space?

6999
03:17:34,280 --> 03:17:35,113
Accidents.

7000
03:17:35,690 --> 03:17:37,500
Did you imagine again guys,

7001
03:17:37,520 --> 03:17:38,720
these are guys that were going,

7002
03:17:38,730 --> 03:17:38,880
Whoa,

7003
03:17:38,880 --> 03:17:39,160
what?

7004
03:17:39,160 --> 03:17:39,921
What did we practice?

7005
03:17:39,921 --> 03:17:41,570
They're like taking them
through the drills going,

7006
03:17:41,930 --> 03:17:42,763
wait a minute.

7007
03:17:43,280 --> 03:17:43,701
Do you think,

7008
03:17:43,701 --> 03:17:44,840
remember the guy hung the lemon?

7009
03:17:44,870 --> 03:17:45,950
You know all about that shit.

7010
03:17:46,020 --> 03:17:46,820
Yeah.

7011
03:17:46,820 --> 03:17:48,980
Eight fucking died in 1968.

7012
03:17:49,040 --> 03:17:50,360
Eight 11 total.

7013
03:17:50,361 --> 03:17:54,470
11 as astronauts dead
three in the fire that uh,

7014
03:17:54,530 --> 03:17:59,530
that happened in the capsule during
testing and then a car racks up a random

7015
03:18:00,561 --> 03:18:00,861
plane.

7016
03:18:00,861 --> 03:18:01,640
Accidents.

7017
03:18:01,640 --> 03:18:02,780
All guys that were saying,

7018
03:18:02,781 --> 03:18:04,940
we are not going to the God damn moon.

7019
03:18:05,040 --> 03:18:05,311
I,

7020
03:18:05,311 --> 03:18:06,750
I understand what you're saying,

7021
03:18:06,751 --> 03:18:07,350
but uh,

7022
03:18:07,350 --> 03:18:10,530
as a voice of reason or
as a skeptical voice,

7023
03:18:11,040 --> 03:18:11,430
um,

7024
03:18:11,430 --> 03:18:12,570
I would like to know,

7025
03:18:12,620 --> 03:18:13,680
I'm not saying one way or the other,

7026
03:18:13,681 --> 03:18:18,210
but I would like to know what the numbers
for astronauts normally are and dying

7027
03:18:18,211 --> 03:18:20,670
and test pilot and rockets and shit.

7028
03:18:20,700 --> 03:18:21,480
That's a good question.

7029
03:18:21,480 --> 03:18:21,721
I mean,

7030
03:18:21,721 --> 03:18:22,740
I'm not saying that they didn't,

7031
03:18:22,800 --> 03:18:25,110
that dude's family still
believes they whacked him.

7032
03:18:25,500 --> 03:18:27,980
That dude from the guy
who will hung the loo,

7033
03:18:28,010 --> 03:18:28,860
the lemon on there,

7034
03:18:28,861 --> 03:18:28,920
the

7035
03:18:28,920 --> 03:18:29,370
lamb,

7036
03:18:29,370 --> 03:18:30,270
what the fuck was that name?

7037
03:18:30,340 --> 03:18:31,041
One inspector,

7038
03:18:31,041 --> 03:18:32,900
the NASA inspector that
was going to tell the,

7039
03:18:32,901 --> 03:18:34,890
testified in front of a,

7040
03:18:35,120 --> 03:18:36,380
some congress and said,

7041
03:18:36,381 --> 03:18:36,681
listen,

7042
03:18:36,681 --> 03:18:37,040
this is,

7043
03:18:37,040 --> 03:18:38,630
we're not going anywhere.

7044
03:18:39,050 --> 03:18:40,340
He got suicidal.

7045
03:18:40,540 --> 03:18:44,270
He parked his train on a track with his
family or parked his car and a train

7046
03:18:44,271 --> 03:18:45,440
track with his family on it.

7047
03:18:45,980 --> 03:18:46,880
Not that that guy's,

7048
03:18:47,170 --> 03:18:48,080
that doesn't seem fishy.

7049
03:18:48,120 --> 03:18:48,953
Do Push.

7050
03:18:49,400 --> 03:18:50,300
I can push.

7051
03:18:50,380 --> 03:18:50,750
It does,

7052
03:18:50,750 --> 03:18:52,120
I think fishing to everybody.

7053
03:18:52,121 --> 03:18:52,301
Like,

7054
03:18:52,301 --> 03:18:52,900
wait a minute.

7055
03:18:52,900 --> 03:18:55,510
I pushed a lot of that
stuff just out of my head.

7056
03:18:55,780 --> 03:18:56,021
I'm like,

7057
03:18:56,021 --> 03:18:58,570
I don't even want to deal with it
anymore because it was so frustrating.

7058
03:18:58,600 --> 03:18:59,410
Yeah.

7059
03:18:59,410 --> 03:19:00,041
The uh,

7060
03:19:00,041 --> 03:19:01,150
a lot of the,

7061
03:19:01,151 --> 03:19:01,600
uh,

7062
03:19:01,600 --> 03:19:02,620
that's what's going on right now.

7063
03:19:03,030 --> 03:19:05,390
Jeff K stuff go over the jail

7064
03:19:05,450 --> 03:19:07,460
k stuff and it makes you a real life game.

7065
03:19:07,480 --> 03:19:08,800
The game of Thrones
that's makes your head,

7066
03:19:09,230 --> 03:19:11,330
there's so many characters and JFK,

7067
03:19:11,540 --> 03:19:13,400
there's so many holy shit.

7068
03:19:13,630 --> 03:19:18,630
It's like all the mob guys that were
involved and all of the government,

7069
03:19:19,040 --> 03:19:21,380
the way it was all went down and all the,

7070
03:19:21,590 --> 03:19:23,480
there's so much shit.

7071
03:19:23,640 --> 03:19:24,740
What's that takes forever.

7072
03:19:24,800 --> 03:19:27,890
Can I find this eight
astronauts dying in 1968?

7073
03:19:28,430 --> 03:19:29,900
I didn't look it up.

7074
03:19:29,930 --> 03:19:32,010
We're just real quick from the,

7075
03:19:32,310 --> 03:19:32,900
the man.

7076
03:19:32,900 --> 03:19:37,340
Three of the three of them died in a fire
and [inaudible] 67 who was the guy who

7077
03:19:37,341 --> 03:19:39,860
hung the lunar limb on the lunar module?

7078
03:19:40,490 --> 03:19:41,323
Grissom.

7079
03:19:41,900 --> 03:19:42,171
Yeah.

7080
03:19:42,171 --> 03:19:42,950
Gus Grissom.

7081
03:19:42,950 --> 03:19:43,783
Gus Grissom.

7082
03:19:44,080 --> 03:19:44,590
You hang on.

7083
03:19:44,590 --> 03:19:44,930
No,

7084
03:19:44,930 --> 03:19:45,471
they all knew.

7085
03:19:45,471 --> 03:19:45,731
They were,

7086
03:19:45,731 --> 03:19:47,160
remember the name of the inspectors.

7087
03:19:47,161 --> 03:19:47,961
They knew they weren't going,

7088
03:19:47,961 --> 03:19:49,370
I don't remember the
name of the inspector.

7089
03:19:49,371 --> 03:19:50,160
I'm surprised about my,

7090
03:19:50,160 --> 03:19:51,590
I used to be able to recite that shit,

7091
03:19:51,730 --> 03:19:52,940
but look into him too.

7092
03:19:52,941 --> 03:19:53,660
They killed him.

7093
03:19:53,660 --> 03:19:54,110
He was,

7094
03:19:54,110 --> 03:19:55,070
he was testifying.

7095
03:19:55,100 --> 03:19:55,330
He goes,

7096
03:19:55,330 --> 03:19:57,850
what are we doing here and
get home and it caught,

7097
03:19:57,980 --> 03:20:01,460
I think it costs $30 billion
or something to adjust it.

7098
03:20:01,461 --> 03:20:03,500
I think that's adjusted
to American dollars.

7099
03:20:03,760 --> 03:20:04,593
Yeah,

7100
03:20:05,360 --> 03:20:05,931
like the fence.

7101
03:20:05,931 --> 03:20:06,890
Like here's another example.

7102
03:20:06,891 --> 03:20:07,724
Like the fence,

7103
03:20:08,000 --> 03:20:08,833
the fence,

7104
03:20:08,910 --> 03:20:09,740
they,

7105
03:20:09,740 --> 03:20:11,330
congressmen lobbied for it.

7106
03:20:11,480 --> 03:20:12,770
I don't know exactly how it got passed,

7107
03:20:12,771 --> 03:20:13,610
but they got paid,

7108
03:20:13,860 --> 03:20:14,320
uh,

7109
03:20:14,320 --> 03:20:16,340
like $3 billion to build that fence.

7110
03:20:16,400 --> 03:20:19,550
The fence that separates Mexico from
the United States all the way across the

7111
03:20:19,551 --> 03:20:20,384
south west.

7112
03:20:20,480 --> 03:20:21,500
They never finished it.

7113
03:20:21,501 --> 03:20:22,400
They got paid for everything.

7114
03:20:22,610 --> 03:20:23,720
It's so not finished.

7115
03:20:23,721 --> 03:20:24,950
It's like half finished.

7116
03:20:25,330 --> 03:20:26,360
It's abandoned it.

7117
03:20:26,480 --> 03:20:27,051
You know what that was?

7118
03:20:27,051 --> 03:20:27,801
It was a money grab.

7119
03:20:27,801 --> 03:20:29,030
It's simple political.

7120
03:20:29,190 --> 03:20:29,410
We,

7121
03:20:29,410 --> 03:20:33,860
we create all this funding for something
and then fucking Skimm pay for some of

7122
03:20:33,861 --> 03:20:34,160
it,

7123
03:20:34,160 --> 03:20:35,260
but then if it falls apart,

7124
03:20:35,280 --> 03:20:36,410
no one even keeps track of it.

7125
03:20:36,560 --> 03:20:39,260
There's a documentary called the
fence will blow your fucking mind.

7126
03:20:39,380 --> 03:20:40,220
They never finished that.

7127
03:20:40,221 --> 03:20:41,054
They abandoned it.

7128
03:20:41,210 --> 03:20:42,080
It's deserted.

7129
03:20:42,290 --> 03:20:43,180
Mexican dudes are going,

7130
03:20:43,190 --> 03:20:44,420
what are these Americans doing?

7131
03:20:44,540 --> 03:20:46,250
They're interviewing
Mexicans that are just like,

7132
03:20:46,430 --> 03:20:47,263
this is easy.

7133
03:20:47,330 --> 03:20:47,750
It's,

7134
03:20:47,750 --> 03:20:49,280
it's ridiculous.

7135
03:20:49,340 --> 03:20:50,240
But that's what it is.

7136
03:20:50,330 --> 03:20:51,980
Like anytime they put
a satellite into space,

7137
03:20:52,130 --> 03:20:53,600
fucking $35 million,

7138
03:20:53,601 --> 03:20:53,781
they go,

7139
03:20:53,781 --> 03:20:54,291
we need a sound.

7140
03:20:54,291 --> 03:20:55,670
Like the more telecommunications,

7141
03:20:55,910 --> 03:20:57,260
they fucking launched some shit.

7142
03:20:57,290 --> 03:20:59,480
Who knows what that satellites doing?

7143
03:20:59,570 --> 03:21:00,440
They got paid.

7144
03:21:00,500 --> 03:21:01,640
They do it all the Goddamn time.

7145
03:21:01,641 --> 03:21:02,331
It's a scam.

7146
03:21:02,331 --> 03:21:03,720
It's a mom with you Alex

7147
03:21:04,110 --> 03:21:04,500
again.

7148
03:21:04,500 --> 03:21:07,740
I lose you when we went from Mexicans
getting into the cross the border,

7149
03:21:07,750 --> 03:21:08,583
no fun.

7150
03:21:09,120 --> 03:21:10,720
You're talking about
Scott in the satellites.

7151
03:21:11,000 --> 03:21:11,820
It's all a scam.

7152
03:21:11,820 --> 03:21:12,300
Okay,

7153
03:21:12,300 --> 03:21:12,711
but the,

7154
03:21:12,711 --> 03:21:13,560
the Mexican one?

7155
03:21:13,561 --> 03:21:13,741
Yeah.

7156
03:21:13,741 --> 03:21:14,940
Why didn't they finish that?

7157
03:21:14,941 --> 03:21:16,770
How much money do they
need to finish that fence?

7158
03:21:17,160 --> 03:21:18,930
But the problem and they dig holes,

7159
03:21:19,170 --> 03:21:20,370
even if you finish the fence,

7160
03:21:20,430 --> 03:21:20,960
they never,

7161
03:21:20,960 --> 03:21:21,541
they could have,

7162
03:21:21,541 --> 03:21:22,620
but they never even finished.

7163
03:21:22,920 --> 03:21:23,630
They just go around them.

7164
03:21:23,630 --> 03:21:25,650
They fill areas that
the documentary is like,

7165
03:21:25,680 --> 03:21:27,180
they show Mexico around the fence.

7166
03:21:27,390 --> 03:21:27,870
How much,

7167
03:21:27,870 --> 03:21:28,860
how much fences left.

7168
03:21:29,210 --> 03:21:30,030
They leave behind.

7169
03:21:30,030 --> 03:21:35,030
I don't know enough not to have enough
until I've made what they put up a

7170
03:21:35,581 --> 03:21:36,414
complete waste.

7171
03:21:36,670 --> 03:21:37,320
Alright,

7172
03:21:37,320 --> 03:21:41,670
well that's when Trump gets into office
to fence is going to get 10 yeah,

7173
03:21:41,760 --> 03:21:42,960
10 foot higher.

7174
03:21:43,500 --> 03:21:44,221
Did you see that?

7175
03:21:44,221 --> 03:21:44,400
Uh,

7176
03:21:44,400 --> 03:21:45,990
the New York Times thing through P,

7177
03:21:46,030 --> 03:21:47,270
they're coming after him today.

7178
03:21:47,730 --> 03:21:51,470
They're talking about racial bias
and like renting houses and stuff,

7179
03:21:51,920 --> 03:21:53,350
renting property.

7180
03:21:53,410 --> 03:21:54,243
Pretty

7181
03:21:56,880 --> 03:21:57,341
crazy.

7182
03:21:57,341 --> 03:21:59,680
He's so close to being the
president of United States.

7183
03:22:00,490 --> 03:22:01,323
You don't think so.

7184
03:22:01,390 --> 03:22:02,260
Hundred percent.

7185
03:22:02,261 --> 03:22:02,930
And he's like,

7186
03:22:02,930 --> 03:22:05,210
what if he does he know when it's so,

7187
03:22:06,040 --> 03:22:08,710
it's so obvious it's
Hillary's going to win,

7188
03:22:08,711 --> 03:22:09,544
dude.

7189
03:22:09,700 --> 03:22:14,020
100% I think so 100% it's
so obvious what Trump,

7190
03:22:14,020 --> 03:22:15,010
Trump's just there to say whatever.

7191
03:22:15,011 --> 03:22:17,680
He's super smart and he
just says whatever he says,

7192
03:22:17,681 --> 03:22:19,600
whatever it takes to win a certain debate.

7193
03:22:19,810 --> 03:22:20,590
And he just goes up.

7194
03:22:20,590 --> 03:22:21,670
They're letting them go off.

7195
03:22:21,671 --> 03:22:22,091
They're just like,

7196
03:22:22,091 --> 03:22:22,331
they said,

7197
03:22:22,331 --> 03:22:23,000
go off.

7198
03:22:23,000 --> 03:22:23,830
Get crazy.

7199
03:22:23,830 --> 03:22:27,520
So now the former head of the CIA,

7200
03:22:27,800 --> 03:22:28,330
there's a,

7201
03:22:28,330 --> 03:22:33,330
there's a video where it says a c had
a CIA denounced as Hillary and Trump.

7202
03:22:34,000 --> 03:22:34,511
Really?

7203
03:22:34,511 --> 03:22:35,710
He's denouncing Trump.

7204
03:22:35,711 --> 03:22:36,970
He's crucified Trump.

7205
03:22:37,150 --> 03:22:38,500
And when they ask about Hillary,

7206
03:22:38,620 --> 03:22:39,161
he says,

7207
03:22:39,161 --> 03:22:39,994
uh,

7208
03:22:40,000 --> 03:22:40,720
you know,

7209
03:22:40,720 --> 03:22:42,220
I got a lot of issues with Hillary,

7210
03:22:42,221 --> 03:22:42,671
but you know,

7211
03:22:42,671 --> 03:22:43,030
she,

7212
03:22:43,030 --> 03:22:44,140
she was better than Trump.

7213
03:22:44,290 --> 03:22:47,170
And in a lot of ways she's
better than Obama too,

7214
03:22:47,171 --> 03:22:49,180
but I got my issues with Hillary.

7215
03:22:49,181 --> 03:22:50,014
But Trump,

7216
03:22:50,050 --> 03:22:50,770
that dude,

7217
03:22:50,770 --> 03:22:51,401
so really,

7218
03:22:51,401 --> 03:22:54,640
he's the head of the CIA is bearing Trump.

7219
03:22:54,880 --> 03:22:56,500
They want Hillary to win really,

7220
03:22:56,501 --> 03:22:57,190
really mad.

7221
03:22:57,190 --> 03:22:58,600
And if they want Hillary to win,

7222
03:22:58,780 --> 03:22:59,410
trust me,

7223
03:22:59,410 --> 03:23:00,310
Hillary's going to win.

7224
03:23:00,311 --> 03:23:01,144
That's all

7225
03:23:01,210 --> 03:23:04,000
devil's advocate and conspiracy
theorists at the same time,

7226
03:23:04,240 --> 03:23:05,560
if he did win,

7227
03:23:05,830 --> 03:23:10,240
they should be fucking terrified because
if Donald Trump actually does win and

7228
03:23:10,241 --> 03:23:12,550
gets into office and
actually gets to explode,

7229
03:23:12,610 --> 03:23:14,110
he's a loose cannon.

7230
03:23:14,290 --> 03:23:16,000
He's not playing by their fucking rules.

7231
03:23:16,180 --> 03:23:20,920
If they pull him aside and tell him him
some crazy shit about Afghanistan or

7232
03:23:21,700 --> 03:23:24,070
Rwanda or Africa,

7233
03:23:24,100 --> 03:23:24,211
well,

7234
03:23:24,211 --> 03:23:25,420
whatever it is about the world,

7235
03:23:25,690 --> 03:23:30,460
who knows what protocol he's going to
follow this as far as how he decides to

7236
03:23:30,461 --> 03:23:31,780
react to that information.

7237
03:23:31,930 --> 03:23:34,240
Who knows what government organizations,

7238
03:23:34,241 --> 03:23:35,650
he's going to try to disband who?

7239
03:23:35,730 --> 03:23:36,880
He's a wild man.

7240
03:23:37,200 --> 03:23:38,710
He might slash and burn

7241
03:23:39,000 --> 03:23:41,190
the way Hillary won California.

7242
03:23:41,191 --> 03:23:41,731
This is just me,

7243
03:23:41,731 --> 03:23:41,911
just,

7244
03:23:41,911 --> 03:23:42,744
I don't know shit,

7245
03:23:42,810 --> 03:23:43,710
but this is my guest.

7246
03:23:43,770 --> 03:23:44,680
The way she won,

7247
03:23:44,900 --> 03:23:45,390
uh,

7248
03:23:45,390 --> 03:23:46,830
in California and the way,

7249
03:23:46,950 --> 03:23:48,330
remember George W.

7250
03:23:48,330 --> 03:23:49,200
Bush won in Florida.

7251
03:23:49,201 --> 03:23:54,201
I remember that one going the way they
did whatever was involved in that shit is

7252
03:23:54,721 --> 03:23:58,890
going to be involved in the main shit
this year and Hillary's going to win.

7253
03:23:58,920 --> 03:23:59,753
That's my opinion.

7254
03:24:00,140 --> 03:24:01,300
That's what that thought was right.

7255
03:24:02,420 --> 03:24:02,840
Well,

7256
03:24:02,840 --> 03:24:03,673
you might be right.

7257
03:24:03,800 --> 03:24:04,311
You know what,

7258
03:24:04,311 --> 03:24:04,581
man,

7259
03:24:04,581 --> 03:24:07,760
it's just weird that this is all the
Republicans have and it's weird that this

7260
03:24:07,761 --> 03:24:08,221
is all the demo,

7261
03:24:08,221 --> 03:24:08,330
right?

7262
03:24:08,330 --> 03:24:08,790
Grads hat.

7263
03:24:08,790 --> 03:24:09,461
I think it's just,

7264
03:24:09,461 --> 03:24:11,720
it's just the way I think
that's the way they planned it.

7265
03:24:12,440 --> 03:24:12,681
No,

7266
03:24:12,681 --> 03:24:13,101
I don't though.

7267
03:24:13,101 --> 03:24:14,990
I don't think there's
very many people who,

7268
03:24:14,991 --> 03:24:15,620
um,

7269
03:24:15,620 --> 03:24:17,840
want to be a president anyway.

7270
03:24:18,080 --> 03:24:20,360
I think Trump is on their
side and he's playing along.

7271
03:24:20,361 --> 03:24:20,901
He's doing that.

7272
03:24:20,901 --> 03:24:25,901
He's just being obnoxious and being crazy
and then no one's going to be sad when

7273
03:24:26,611 --> 03:24:26,861
he loads.

7274
03:24:26,861 --> 03:24:27,260
It was,

7275
03:24:27,260 --> 03:24:28,310
no one's going to be sad.

7276
03:24:28,620 --> 03:24:29,700
The worst theory in the world.

7277
03:24:29,730 --> 03:24:30,150
Yeah.

7278
03:24:30,150 --> 03:24:30,983
Crooked Hillary.

7279
03:24:31,170 --> 03:24:31,621
I love it.

7280
03:24:31,621 --> 03:24:33,930
How he comes up with names
to them like Lion Ted,

7281
03:24:34,250 --> 03:24:37,060
letting them go off cause he seems
legit cause they know it doesn't matter.

7282
03:24:37,540 --> 03:24:38,373
It doesn't matter.

7283
03:24:38,410 --> 03:24:40,820
He's going down there and
there's no way he's going win.

7284
03:24:40,870 --> 03:24:41,210
Jamie,

7285
03:24:41,210 --> 03:24:42,520
call this transy sports.

7286
03:24:42,521 --> 03:24:44,100
It's just the fuck

7287
03:24:44,100 --> 03:24:44,790
out of me.

7288
03:24:44,790 --> 03:24:49,110
These gentlemen are getting into trouble
and they're causing ruckuses and it's

7289
03:24:49,111 --> 03:24:49,390
uh,

7290
03:24:49,390 --> 03:24:49,650
they,

7291
03:24:49,650 --> 03:24:52,170
they know how to like keep you
paying attention to that shit.

7292
03:24:52,380 --> 03:24:53,760
Those TMZ sports shows,

7293
03:24:53,940 --> 03:24:54,800
it's just smashed.

7294
03:24:54,801 --> 03:24:55,740
Got Smashed Gut.

7295
03:24:55,800 --> 03:24:56,750
Why is she crying?

7296
03:24:56,751 --> 03:24:56,970
Limb.

7297
03:24:56,970 --> 03:24:57,250
Okay.

7298
03:24:57,250 --> 03:24:58,083
Door open,

7299
03:25:01,150 --> 03:25:01,983
black and white.

7300
03:25:04,500 --> 03:25:05,190
Well,

7301
03:25:05,190 --> 03:25:06,023
TMJ

7302
03:25:09,230 --> 03:25:10,930
girls grabbing hand the recipe.

7303
03:25:10,931 --> 03:25:14,470
I need to pick a shot of a girl
throwing a drink in a guy's face.

7304
03:25:14,530 --> 03:25:16,000
It's like hypnosis though,

7305
03:25:16,001 --> 03:25:16,241
man.

7306
03:25:16,241 --> 03:25:17,080
Like you get stuck.

7307
03:25:17,081 --> 03:25:19,990
Like I'm talking and I'm watching
all this go on in the background.

7308
03:25:19,991 --> 03:25:20,171
I'm like,

7309
03:25:20,171 --> 03:25:20,351
Whoa,

7310
03:25:20,351 --> 03:25:20,560
Whoa,

7311
03:25:20,560 --> 03:25:20,860
Whoa,

7312
03:25:20,860 --> 03:25:21,400
whoa.

7313
03:25:21,400 --> 03:25:22,450
What's happening back there?

7314
03:25:23,080 --> 03:25:23,800
It's funny how you

7315
03:25:23,800 --> 03:25:24,370
get a,

7316
03:25:24,370 --> 03:25:25,203
like you were talking,

7317
03:25:25,210 --> 03:25:29,110
you were the one who explained that to
me once the first time about music videos

7318
03:25:29,230 --> 03:25:31,510
that music videos have
to be like smash cuts.

7319
03:25:31,630 --> 03:25:33,180
You've got to go from one
scene to the next scene.

7320
03:25:33,230 --> 03:25:34,600
The next scene to the next split second,

7321
03:25:34,601 --> 03:25:35,180
fourth.

7322
03:25:35,180 --> 03:25:37,660
You can't have anything
play on for a long time.

7323
03:25:37,661 --> 03:25:39,040
People just stop paying attention.

7324
03:25:39,510 --> 03:25:40,343
Yeah.

7325
03:25:40,420 --> 03:25:41,110
And the more,

7326
03:25:41,110 --> 03:25:42,190
the less continuity,

7327
03:25:42,191 --> 03:25:42,880
the better.

7328
03:25:42,880 --> 03:25:43,780
The only reason they,

7329
03:25:43,830 --> 03:25:46,780
they keep going back to certain sets
because they only could afford seven sets.

7330
03:25:47,440 --> 03:25:50,530
But really the ultimate
video would be you never go,

7331
03:25:50,540 --> 03:25:51,550
you use every set,

7332
03:25:51,551 --> 03:25:52,450
just one shot.

7333
03:25:52,990 --> 03:25:53,860
That would be the ultimate,

7334
03:25:53,861 --> 03:25:54,820
but you've got to have seven.

7335
03:25:55,030 --> 03:25:57,010
And he threw it to
three minute video shit.

7336
03:25:57,011 --> 03:25:59,740
We got to hit that set
like maybe six times each.

7337
03:25:59,741 --> 03:26:00,574
You know what I mean?

7338
03:26:00,580 --> 03:26:01,413
So,

7339
03:26:01,420 --> 03:26:02,140
uh,

7340
03:26:02,140 --> 03:26:04,240
that's how the videos are just uh,

7341
03:26:04,720 --> 03:26:07,640
just we got to bombard you with shit to,

7342
03:26:07,750 --> 03:26:08,583
and it goes,

7343
03:26:08,710 --> 03:26:11,320
everything's cut to the
music nice and fast.

7344
03:26:11,321 --> 03:26:13,060
And there was a lot of bands got cars,

7345
03:26:13,450 --> 03:26:14,470
real visual.

7346
03:26:14,530 --> 03:26:15,820
Dude's driving in cars.

7347
03:26:15,850 --> 03:26:18,970
You got to have a video and you
somewhat disagree or driving.

7348
03:26:19,000 --> 03:26:19,833
You know what I mean?

7349
03:26:19,840 --> 03:26:24,420
DMX has a video of him driving the
ultimate video of him driving it.

7350
03:26:24,610 --> 03:26:27,520
It's like some weird sin
city type special effects.

7351
03:26:27,521 --> 03:26:28,570
I forget what song it is.

7352
03:26:28,571 --> 03:26:29,251
Fuck what?

7353
03:26:29,251 --> 03:26:30,430
It's so good.

7354
03:26:30,460 --> 03:26:31,420
God down.

7355
03:26:32,100 --> 03:26:33,250
Do you ever seen the one where uh,

7356
03:26:33,251 --> 03:26:33,870
the best,

7357
03:26:33,870 --> 03:26:34,090
uh,

7358
03:26:34,090 --> 03:26:37,840
one of the best gifs animated
gifs of all time is um,

7359
03:26:38,650 --> 03:26:39,220
um,

7360
03:26:39,220 --> 03:26:40,810
50 cent sitting in a,

7361
03:26:40,811 --> 03:26:43,510
a drop top Bentley and uh,

7362
03:26:43,511 --> 03:26:46,210
he like throws his head back
and laughed and drives off.

7363
03:26:46,750 --> 03:26:48,670
He's in this like super dope.

7364
03:26:49,120 --> 03:26:52,810
Probably like how much does it drop
top Bentley like $400,000 or something

7365
03:26:52,811 --> 03:26:53,320
crazy.

7366
03:26:53,320 --> 03:26:54,460
It must be something crazy,

7367
03:26:54,490 --> 03:26:54,791
right?

7368
03:26:54,791 --> 03:26:55,420
You would not,

7369
03:26:55,420 --> 03:26:56,850
I would say 158,

7370
03:26:56,851 --> 03:26:57,341
he pulls up,

7371
03:26:57,341 --> 03:27:00,520
this guy's like a dope car and here
57 pulls up to him and looks at him.

7372
03:27:00,970 --> 03:27:01,121
Oh,

7373
03:27:01,121 --> 03:27:01,960
it's the dude from,

7374
03:27:01,961 --> 03:27:03,340
it's the turtle guy from entourage.

7375
03:27:03,350 --> 03:27:03,700
It looks,

7376
03:27:03,700 --> 03:27:04,533
so

7377
03:27:05,140 --> 03:27:09,430
I pulled up next to 50 cent once
he had a driver behind them,

7378
03:27:09,431 --> 03:27:11,620
like trying to cut me off to
make sure to protect them.

7379
03:27:11,621 --> 03:27:15,400
He was dropped by the convertible just
like that while I was filming the DVD,

7380
03:27:15,401 --> 03:27:16,420
mastering the rubber car.

7381
03:27:16,490 --> 03:27:16,870
Why would,

7382
03:27:16,870 --> 03:27:17,980
this is like 10 years ago,

7383
03:27:18,100 --> 03:27:21,880
why were we were driving around and
dude's filming me as I'm driving and I'm

7384
03:27:21,881 --> 03:27:23,920
talking about Jujitsu and
we pull up and we're like,

7385
03:27:24,100 --> 03:27:25,020
there's 50 cents.

7386
03:27:26,250 --> 03:27:27,083
It was crazy.

7387
03:27:27,520 --> 03:27:28,580
Cars are so crazy.

7388
03:27:28,600 --> 03:27:32,230
Remember when you saw them like I was
on the front of the front of the comedy

7389
03:27:32,231 --> 03:27:33,870
store ones and a Bugatti VA.

7390
03:27:33,871 --> 03:27:35,360
Ron drove up and I was,

7391
03:27:35,440 --> 03:27:37,240
are you ever seen one of those?

7392
03:27:37,270 --> 03:27:37,950
It's worth though.

7393
03:27:37,950 --> 03:27:39,100
It's more than a million dollars.

7394
03:27:39,210 --> 03:27:40,870
Only in that video I,

7395
03:27:41,130 --> 03:27:42,010
I woke up in

7396
03:27:42,010 --> 03:27:42,650
a new boo,

7397
03:27:42,650 --> 03:27:44,160
got a pull him.

7398
03:27:44,440 --> 03:27:46,280
I woke up in a new move out.

7399
03:27:47,400 --> 03:27:48,590
That's a great song by the way.

7400
03:27:48,790 --> 03:27:50,770
Ace Hood and he's Hood Shit.

7401
03:27:51,070 --> 03:27:51,580
That's a great,

7402
03:27:51,580 --> 03:27:53,170
that's the only time
I've ever seen a Bugatti.

7403
03:27:53,530 --> 03:27:54,281
How much do they cost?

7404
03:27:54,281 --> 03:27:55,420
It's over 1 million bucks.

7405
03:27:55,440 --> 03:27:56,130
Oh Shit.

7406
03:27:56,130 --> 03:27:58,540
How much it costs and
woke up in a boot Gotti.

7407
03:27:58,541 --> 03:27:59,190
That's the name of the,

7408
03:27:59,190 --> 03:28:00,100
that's the chorus.

7409
03:28:00,160 --> 03:28:01,570
It's the craziest car ever.

7410
03:28:01,571 --> 03:28:02,404
It's like,

7411
03:28:02,440 --> 03:28:04,060
you know what it's like the inside of it.

7412
03:28:04,680 --> 03:28:07,870
It's the inside of it is like
some sort of a time machine.

7413
03:28:07,871 --> 03:28:09,700
Some Fewster of sick time machine.

7414
03:28:09,910 --> 03:28:12,040
It doesn't even seem like a
real car when you're inside it.

7415
03:28:12,041 --> 03:28:15,190
When you see like the interior
and the way it's all constructed,

7416
03:28:15,191 --> 03:28:18,790
it's all handmade with these crazy
gauges and just beautiful leathers,

7417
03:28:19,120 --> 03:28:21,430
but it doesn't look like
any other modern car.

7418
03:28:21,640 --> 03:28:25,960
It looks like something like someone
from the Hg wells days who was trying to

7419
03:28:25,961 --> 03:28:27,790
draw like a future supercar.

7420
03:28:27,840 --> 03:28:29,080
You would draw some weird,

7421
03:28:29,410 --> 03:28:31,600
we've got Eva Ron type spaceship thing.

7422
03:28:31,720 --> 03:28:32,590
It's very interesting.

7423
03:28:32,591 --> 03:28:34,210
It's very much its own kind of car,

7424
03:28:34,690 --> 03:28:37,510
but it's stupid expensive
and insanely fast.

7425
03:28:37,690 --> 03:28:40,090
I think it has more than
a thousand horsepower,

7426
03:28:41,440 --> 03:28:45,700
which is just as faster than a
motorcycle and 1200 horsepower.

7427
03:28:46,420 --> 03:28:48,730
What's the in sand right
now with the motorcycle?

7428
03:28:48,731 --> 03:28:50,470
Zero to 60 and what?

7429
03:28:50,600 --> 03:28:51,520
They just disappear.

7430
03:28:51,521 --> 03:28:52,450
They just vanish.

7431
03:28:52,740 --> 03:28:53,590
Travel through time.

7432
03:28:53,740 --> 03:28:54,970
Record two seconds.

7433
03:28:55,570 --> 03:28:56,620
It's probably less than that.

7434
03:28:56,640 --> 03:28:57,070
Once.

7435
03:28:57,070 --> 03:28:58,510
Zero to 60 in one second.

7436
03:28:58,540 --> 03:28:58,841
Yeah.

7437
03:28:58,841 --> 03:28:59,081
Dude,

7438
03:28:59,081 --> 03:29:02,830
they have these cars now that are doing
it in less than three like regular cars.

7439
03:29:02,831 --> 03:29:03,970
You can go and buy at the store.

7440
03:29:03,971 --> 03:29:04,421
No.

7441
03:29:04,421 --> 03:29:04,720
Well,

7442
03:29:04,720 --> 03:29:06,340
I think the Tesla does it very quickly.

7443
03:29:06,370 --> 03:29:07,180
What's the lettuce with that?

7444
03:29:07,180 --> 03:29:10,090
They've got some new shit coming up
fast as a Tesla goes zero to 60 I was

7445
03:29:10,091 --> 03:29:10,841
thinking about the,

7446
03:29:10,841 --> 03:29:11,650
uh,

7447
03:29:11,650 --> 03:29:16,650
I heard about the Porsche nine 11 turbo
s I think it does it in 2.8 seconds.

7448
03:29:17,050 --> 03:29:17,691
Zero to six.

7449
03:29:17,691 --> 03:29:18,850
Does it ever get to one?

7450
03:29:18,880 --> 03:29:19,713
Does that happen?

7451
03:29:19,720 --> 03:29:20,553
Yeah.

7452
03:29:21,250 --> 03:29:22,840
If it got as far as it got,

7453
03:29:22,850 --> 03:29:23,950
he's going to get to that.

7454
03:29:24,040 --> 03:29:25,090
It's going to get to one,

7455
03:29:25,330 --> 03:29:27,670
but there's gotta be a lot
of g force in that jets.

7456
03:29:27,700 --> 03:29:28,240
That's not,

7457
03:29:28,240 --> 03:29:30,170
that's not an easy thing to model.

7458
03:29:30,240 --> 03:29:32,560
S can do it in 2.5 Jesus,

7459
03:29:33,870 --> 03:29:36,300
that's a nine 11 not Tesla.

7460
03:29:36,400 --> 03:29:36,581
Oh,

7461
03:29:36,581 --> 03:29:40,810
Tesla s 2.5 2.5 is that
faster than a motorcycle?

7462
03:29:41,110 --> 03:29:41,943
I don't think so.

7463
03:29:42,370 --> 03:29:47,370
I think a motorcycle could still do it
and the tuition range if I had entirely

7464
03:29:48,190 --> 03:29:48,881
an electric car.

7465
03:29:48,881 --> 03:29:49,600
That looks cool.

7466
03:29:49,600 --> 03:29:50,740
How about the drives itself?

7467
03:29:51,490 --> 03:29:52,600
How does that work?

7468
03:29:52,660 --> 03:29:52,891
It's,

7469
03:29:52,891 --> 03:29:53,920
it has the cameras.

7470
03:29:54,160 --> 03:29:55,630
It's reading the ground and the,

7471
03:29:55,631 --> 03:29:55,890
the,

7472
03:29:55,890 --> 03:29:57,010
the distance around it.

7473
03:29:57,070 --> 03:29:59,320
That's faster than a lot of
motorcycles on this list.

7474
03:29:59,380 --> 03:30:00,213
Is it really?

7475
03:30:00,310 --> 03:30:03,030
What about later high Bussa perilla is on.

7476
03:30:03,340 --> 03:30:04,720
Hi Bruce is a motorcycle

7477
03:30:06,280 --> 03:30:06,850
was shit.

7478
03:30:06,850 --> 03:30:09,730
I thought that was just a great uh,

7479
03:30:10,090 --> 03:30:11,200
NMA apparel.

7480
03:30:11,230 --> 03:30:12,790
It is great MMA apparel,

7481
03:30:12,940 --> 03:30:14,470
but it's also a bird.

7482
03:30:14,620 --> 03:30:17,650
A very fast bird gets fast.

7483
03:30:18,190 --> 03:30:19,480
What's the fastest bird ever?

7484
03:30:19,481 --> 03:30:21,400
I think it's the pair of Jean Falcon.

7485
03:30:21,970 --> 03:30:24,730
I think there's a falcon that
goes like 200 miles an hour.

7486
03:30:24,731 --> 03:30:26,430
I did a commercial for
them once where I was,

7487
03:30:26,660 --> 03:30:29,290
I was like for the
Falcons for Hyatt Bussa.

7488
03:30:29,350 --> 03:30:30,183
Oh,

7489
03:30:30,200 --> 03:30:31,033
what do you got here Jamie?

7490
03:30:32,080 --> 03:30:32,900
Is that it?

7491
03:30:32,900 --> 03:30:34,030
The fastest bird in the world.

7492
03:30:34,060 --> 03:30:35,590
242 miles an hour.

7493
03:30:38,470 --> 03:30:40,220
Which of course down fast risperidone

7494
03:30:40,260 --> 03:30:45,260
or what it does is it looks for a critter
to Jack and when it's flying around it

7495
03:30:46,641 --> 03:30:51,380
finds one that who wants to fuck with
and then it died dive bombs and just

7496
03:30:51,530 --> 03:30:53,180
achieves insane speed.

7497
03:30:53,510 --> 03:30:56,750
I guess it like just flaps
its wings willy quick.

7498
03:30:56,930 --> 03:30:58,580
It's hard to the perspective,

7499
03:30:58,581 --> 03:31:00,230
it's like you'd see a video on it,

7500
03:31:00,231 --> 03:31:03,530
but it's hard to like grasp
how fast it's actually moving.

7501
03:31:03,830 --> 03:31:06,380
It doesn't seem to make sense
when you're looking at it.

7502
03:31:06,381 --> 03:31:07,940
It just looks like it's going fast.

7503
03:31:08,000 --> 03:31:09,030
You don't have any perspective,

7504
03:31:09,070 --> 03:31:09,980
not on the ground,

7505
03:31:10,370 --> 03:31:13,700
but if like flew by you
when you're on the ground,

7506
03:31:13,701 --> 03:31:14,241
you're probably like,

7507
03:31:14,241 --> 03:31:15,590
what the fuck?

7508
03:31:15,770 --> 03:31:16,603
It's a rod.

7509
03:31:16,900 --> 03:31:19,430
Like that's faster than
any car I've ever seen.

7510
03:31:19,610 --> 03:31:20,840
Like what's a fast car?

7511
03:31:20,960 --> 03:31:22,040
250 miles an hour.

7512
03:31:22,041 --> 03:31:24,380
It's got to be like what
those Nascar guys do,

7513
03:31:24,381 --> 03:31:24,830
right?

7514
03:31:24,830 --> 03:31:26,120
I don't even think there you go that fast.

7515
03:31:26,121 --> 03:31:27,230
That's like a formula one speed.

7516
03:31:27,231 --> 03:31:28,064
Right?

7517
03:31:29,630 --> 03:31:30,770
How fast is Nascar go?

7518
03:31:33,380 --> 03:31:34,970
One 80 Eddie Bravo.

7519
03:31:34,971 --> 03:31:35,804
Hate standards.

7520
03:31:35,810 --> 03:31:38,330
That's one thing me and Eddie Brown
would just not have in common.

7521
03:31:38,900 --> 03:31:39,560
Oh,

7522
03:31:39,560 --> 03:31:41,360
standard manual stick shift cars.

7523
03:31:41,410 --> 03:31:44,350
It's 2016 st the Flintstones.

7524
03:31:44,880 --> 03:31:45,713
I love them.

7525
03:31:47,010 --> 03:31:47,843
I love them.

7526
03:31:48,510 --> 03:31:51,630
I buy certain cars that are older
just because they have stick shifts.

7527
03:31:51,960 --> 03:31:53,460
I like that they're there.

7528
03:31:53,480 --> 03:31:56,400
It's engaging but you you
like associated with man,

7529
03:31:56,401 --> 03:31:57,480
I want to have to shift these fuckers.

7530
03:31:57,550 --> 03:31:58,490
I just want to tell her,

7531
03:31:58,491 --> 03:31:59,291
listen to music.

7532
03:31:59,291 --> 03:32:02,530
I don't have to fucking shift
gears the same to forget it.

7533
03:32:02,770 --> 03:32:03,603
You must be

7534
03:32:05,170 --> 03:32:06,280
nothing wrong with thinking that way,

7535
03:32:06,281 --> 03:32:06,960
man.

7536
03:32:06,960 --> 03:32:07,480
For me.

7537
03:32:07,480 --> 03:32:09,640
You should get an engine
with the fucking front crank.

7538
03:32:10,480 --> 03:32:11,313
No,

7539
03:32:12,130 --> 03:32:13,780
that would be the coolest
shit out when I like,

7540
03:32:13,840 --> 03:32:16,250
I like to start my booking
engine man manually.

7541
03:32:16,300 --> 03:32:17,133
There's a zen

7542
03:32:17,160 --> 03:32:21,140
state that you achieve when you shifting
through the gears yourself and you're,

7543
03:32:21,141 --> 03:32:24,240
you're revving the engine up to a certain
point and you're all tuned in to the

7544
03:32:24,241 --> 03:32:25,320
action of the car.

7545
03:32:25,830 --> 03:32:27,480
Whereas a lot of people
and those kinds of cars,

7546
03:32:27,481 --> 03:32:28,590
they don't even listen to music.

7547
03:32:28,830 --> 03:32:30,160
The music becomes like them.

7548
03:32:30,630 --> 03:32:32,100
The mechanics of the vehicle,

7549
03:32:32,101 --> 03:32:32,970
the engineering,

7550
03:32:32,971 --> 03:32:34,440
the way the tires grip the road,

7551
03:32:34,441 --> 03:32:35,430
you feel it in your ass.

7552
03:32:35,700 --> 03:32:38,880
He shifted gears and you lift up
the clutch and he give it the gas.

7553
03:32:38,881 --> 03:32:43,881
Then you hear the Warhol Wall and you
become an tuned with the machine and you

7554
03:32:45,061 --> 03:32:46,770
start feeling where the machines going.

7555
03:32:47,250 --> 03:32:48,930
And it becomes more of like a,

7556
03:32:48,931 --> 03:32:51,840
an exercise and stimulation
than it does just drive it.

7557
03:32:52,140 --> 03:32:53,370
But I like driving too.

7558
03:32:53,760 --> 03:32:56,670
Like I like driving in a
fucking a big suburban.

7559
03:32:56,970 --> 03:32:59,010
Like I rented a suburban
this past weekend.

7560
03:32:59,310 --> 03:32:59,521
Dude,

7561
03:32:59,521 --> 03:33:02,640
you ever drive one of them
big cushy ass fucking boats?

7562
03:33:02,820 --> 03:33:03,121
No,

7563
03:33:03,121 --> 03:33:06,210
but I saw like this bro is driving.

7564
03:33:06,480 --> 03:33:08,790
Did it have its own builtin vacuum?

7565
03:33:08,791 --> 03:33:09,800
Like I saw minivan,

7566
03:33:09,810 --> 03:33:14,810
the new fucking luminaire or something
has its own that what a great idea.

7567
03:33:15,831 --> 03:33:16,450
Right?

7568
03:33:16,450 --> 03:33:16,890
Kids.

7569
03:33:16,890 --> 03:33:17,431
Shit.

7570
03:33:17,431 --> 03:33:18,264
Super Smart.

7571
03:33:18,390 --> 03:33:19,470
That's actually wicked smart.

7572
03:33:20,050 --> 03:33:20,321
Yeah,

7573
03:33:20,321 --> 03:33:20,591
no,

7574
03:33:20,591 --> 03:33:20,771
no,

7575
03:33:20,771 --> 03:33:21,604
they um,

7576
03:33:22,090 --> 03:33:22,511
this uh,

7577
03:33:22,511 --> 03:33:24,280
those suburbans they're like a,

7578
03:33:24,281 --> 03:33:27,550
they have that Cadillac escalades
Cadillac escalades suspension,

7579
03:33:27,760 --> 03:33:28,541
but it's just cheaper.

7580
03:33:28,541 --> 03:33:30,310
Trim doesn't look as fancy,

7581
03:33:30,460 --> 03:33:32,740
but it's a nice car or
renting one of those man,

7582
03:33:32,741 --> 03:33:34,330
they drive so comfortable.

7583
03:33:34,331 --> 03:33:35,440
They're so relaxed.

7584
03:33:35,650 --> 03:33:37,030
Just like the way it go over bumps.

7585
03:33:37,140 --> 03:33:40,320
Shit I cars of today are so God damn good.

7586
03:33:40,800 --> 03:33:43,770
Like if you had like I was thinking
when I was driving this suburban,

7587
03:33:43,800 --> 03:33:45,300
it's like a 2016 suburban.

7588
03:33:45,540 --> 03:33:45,961
I was like,

7589
03:33:45,961 --> 03:33:50,100
if you got an a 1950s
Mercedes and you'll like,

7590
03:33:50,101 --> 03:33:52,080
this is the shit right now,

7591
03:33:52,110 --> 03:33:53,580
this is as good as it gets.

7592
03:33:53,780 --> 03:33:55,350
And you've gotten a senior like wow,

7593
03:33:55,380 --> 03:33:56,310
leather seats.

7594
03:33:56,540 --> 03:33:57,930
Oh real would handle.

7595
03:33:58,080 --> 03:33:58,291
You know,

7596
03:33:58,291 --> 03:33:59,580
you'd be driving this thing around.

7597
03:33:59,820 --> 03:34:01,080
Thinking is incredible.

7598
03:34:01,140 --> 03:34:03,000
I got the top of the line Mercedes man.

7599
03:34:03,180 --> 03:34:08,180
And then someone shoots you to 2016
and puts you in a regular family truck,

7600
03:34:08,550 --> 03:34:09,600
like a suburban,

7601
03:34:09,720 --> 03:34:13,530
which is just this big huge
ass hunk of metal and dude,

7602
03:34:13,710 --> 03:34:15,450
it floats over the road.

7603
03:34:15,630 --> 03:34:17,370
It has this feeling
when he hit the brakes,

7604
03:34:17,371 --> 03:34:20,700
like it's just engineered to stop
quickly for this big fucking tank.

7605
03:34:20,950 --> 03:34:21,930
He was gigantic.

7606
03:34:21,931 --> 03:34:23,430
It handles good for big,

7607
03:34:23,431 --> 03:34:24,211
gigantic thing.

7608
03:34:24,211 --> 03:34:25,470
It's like comfortable to drive.

7609
03:34:25,790 --> 03:34:30,060
Yet it doesn't look that different than
the cars from the 60s like if the cut

7610
03:34:30,260 --> 03:34:30,780
the shape,

7611
03:34:30,780 --> 03:34:31,730
they got tires.

7612
03:34:31,940 --> 03:34:32,490
Oh yeah.

7613
03:34:32,490 --> 03:34:33,323
Right.

7614
03:34:33,940 --> 03:34:38,450
Generally it the biggest thing a guy
would trip on that's he got jumped on a

7615
03:34:38,451 --> 03:34:42,680
time machine from the sixties to now
wouldn't be the car so much as I still

7616
03:34:42,681 --> 03:34:43,520
fucking tires.

7617
03:34:43,521 --> 03:34:44,660
You guys aren't flying yet.

7618
03:34:45,780 --> 03:34:47,860
It's still round that
the four tires you go,

7619
03:34:47,910 --> 03:34:48,743
you still have four.

7620
03:34:49,010 --> 03:34:51,140
They would trip out on the
phones more than the cars.

7621
03:34:51,440 --> 03:34:51,921
The phones.

7622
03:34:51,921 --> 03:34:52,281
It'd be like,

7623
03:34:52,281 --> 03:34:53,420
what the fuck?

7624
03:34:53,450 --> 03:34:55,280
We're connected with the world.

7625
03:34:55,460 --> 03:34:57,320
This is our connection to everybody.

7626
03:34:57,470 --> 03:34:57,960
It's fine.

7627
03:34:57,960 --> 03:35:00,000
There's some shit that's just too risky.

7628
03:35:00,210 --> 03:35:01,560
Like air balloons.

7629
03:35:01,590 --> 03:35:03,840
They never fucking got
that shit perfected.

7630
03:35:04,050 --> 03:35:05,430
Nobody to hill when he was ever going,

7631
03:35:05,431 --> 03:35:05,791
hey,

7632
03:35:05,791 --> 03:35:06,301
he here.

7633
03:35:06,301 --> 03:35:07,290
You know with air balloons,

7634
03:35:07,291 --> 03:35:08,280
there's no fresh shower.

7635
03:35:08,281 --> 03:35:08,850
Bob,

7636
03:35:08,850 --> 03:35:09,900
he just started the fire,

7637
03:35:09,901 --> 03:35:10,740
fill up the balloon,

7638
03:35:10,741 --> 03:35:11,520
fly home.

7639
03:35:11,520 --> 03:35:12,353
It's no big deal.

7640
03:35:12,640 --> 03:35:13,110
They're like,

7641
03:35:13,110 --> 03:35:13,351
well,

7642
03:35:13,351 --> 03:35:14,760
it's not that accurate today,

7643
03:35:14,761 --> 03:35:15,211
but hey,

7644
03:35:15,211 --> 03:35:16,230
you use the exercise,

7645
03:35:16,231 --> 03:35:17,640
you walk a few miles from your home,

7646
03:35:17,840 --> 03:35:18,040
you,

7647
03:35:18,040 --> 03:35:18,290
you,

7648
03:35:18,290 --> 03:35:21,200
you land your balloon as close as you
can to your home and then you were hung

7649
03:35:21,210 --> 03:35:23,160
just floating through the sky and the air.

7650
03:35:23,490 --> 03:35:24,323
No Way.

7651
03:35:25,020 --> 03:35:25,561
People like,

7652
03:35:25,561 --> 03:35:26,394
fuck man,

7653
03:35:26,460 --> 03:35:27,570
you got to get that down.

7654
03:35:27,630 --> 03:35:30,360
But there's no funding to get it down
because nobody's buying any fucking hot

7655
03:35:30,361 --> 03:35:31,020
air balloons.

7656
03:35:31,020 --> 03:35:31,771
And every now and then,

7657
03:35:31,771 --> 03:35:33,360
like there's a big accident in Texas,

7658
03:35:33,361 --> 03:35:37,080
like really recently in
Texas in an air balloon.

7659
03:35:37,110 --> 03:35:37,350
Yeah.

7660
03:35:37,350 --> 03:35:41,280
It caught fire and everybody died
and it was a quite a few people,

7661
03:35:41,310 --> 03:35:42,240
I don't remember what the,

7662
03:35:42,270 --> 03:35:43,350
what the actual number was,

7663
03:35:43,351 --> 03:35:44,490
but I want to say it was something like,

7664
03:35:44,940 --> 03:35:46,860
it might've been like
seven people or something.

7665
03:35:46,861 --> 03:35:48,650
Died wouldn't for more.

7666
03:35:48,660 --> 03:35:49,321
Jamie wouldn't,

7667
03:35:49,321 --> 03:35:52,380
the core team was at 1416 Google.

7668
03:35:53,860 --> 03:35:54,391
Oh my God,

7669
03:35:54,391 --> 03:35:54,960
that's awful.

7670
03:35:54,960 --> 03:35:57,390
Wouldn't the coolest thing
to do really as a huge,

7671
03:35:57,391 --> 03:35:58,440
don't you put up a video,

7672
03:35:58,441 --> 03:35:58,801
Jamie?

7673
03:35:58,801 --> 03:36:00,390
Don't you put that fucking evil?

7674
03:36:00,391 --> 03:36:00,751
I mean,

7675
03:36:00,751 --> 03:36:02,250
he's reaching for the video button.

7676
03:36:02,251 --> 03:36:03,300
Don't fucking do it,

7677
03:36:03,301 --> 03:36:03,541
man.

7678
03:36:03,541 --> 03:36:07,080
I want to watch that flaming
ball fall to the ground.

7679
03:36:07,790 --> 03:36:08,131
What?

7680
03:36:08,131 --> 03:36:10,550
What would be cooler than
hand gliding as a hobby?

7681
03:36:10,840 --> 03:36:11,631
I think about that.

7682
03:36:11,631 --> 03:36:12,670
Hang gliding to me.

7683
03:36:13,190 --> 03:36:13,560
US,

7684
03:36:13,560 --> 03:36:14,170
Gracie.

7685
03:36:14,170 --> 03:36:15,650
Super dangerous bowls,

7686
03:36:15,651 --> 03:36:16,281
right holes.

7687
03:36:16,281 --> 03:36:16,730
Gracie.

7688
03:36:16,730 --> 03:36:17,230
The time.

7689
03:36:17,230 --> 03:36:19,880
The time is that yet you
did it and you didn't die.

7690
03:36:20,180 --> 03:36:22,310
How cool would that be?

7691
03:36:22,390 --> 03:36:23,510
It kill coolest shit ever,

7692
03:36:23,511 --> 03:36:24,170
right?

7693
03:36:24,170 --> 03:36:25,910
You're flying through the fucking air.

7694
03:36:25,911 --> 03:36:26,690
No engine.

7695
03:36:26,690 --> 03:36:27,381
You're gliding.

7696
03:36:27,381 --> 03:36:30,380
Some guys stay up forever and
they find these little hot Tom.

7697
03:36:30,770 --> 03:36:31,041
I mean,

7698
03:36:31,041 --> 03:36:32,000
it's so dangerous,

7699
03:36:32,001 --> 03:36:35,980
but is it cooler than those
wingsuits I the wingsuits might be

7700
03:36:35,980 --> 03:36:36,700
doper.

7701
03:36:36,700 --> 03:36:38,410
I think you fly more when you're gliding.

7702
03:36:38,411 --> 03:36:41,430
You feel like you're
flying in the wind current.

7703
03:36:41,570 --> 03:36:41,870
Yeah,

7704
03:36:41,870 --> 03:36:42,490
you're,

7705
03:36:42,490 --> 03:36:43,241
you're dipping down.

7706
03:36:43,241 --> 03:36:46,600
It seems like you're fine
falling and you're falling,

7707
03:36:46,601 --> 03:36:47,434
but your la,

7708
03:36:48,620 --> 03:36:52,530
it takes a long time to fall as opposed
to staying up and actually flying and

7709
03:36:52,540 --> 03:36:53,321
blessed mother fucker.

7710
03:36:53,321 --> 03:36:53,831
He's got a jet.

7711
03:36:53,831 --> 03:36:54,160
What's that?

7712
03:36:54,160 --> 03:36:54,993
You're attached to one.

7713
03:36:56,050 --> 03:37:00,100
Let's see that shit pack flying wing
suit available done by your bed.

7714
03:37:00,160 --> 03:37:00,950
By herself.

7715
03:37:00,950 --> 03:37:01,150
Yeah.

7716
03:37:01,150 --> 03:37:01,983
Jet Packs.

7717
03:37:02,020 --> 03:37:02,470
Yeah.

7718
03:37:02,470 --> 03:37:07,470
Jet Pack will soon be available to buy
one for yourself anytime you want jetpack

7719
03:37:08,560 --> 03:37:09,370
flying suit.

7720
03:37:09,370 --> 03:37:11,960
People are going to fucking
suicide bomb right into airplane.

7721
03:37:12,120 --> 03:37:14,460
[inaudible] girlfriend's going
to be flying across the country.

7722
03:37:14,480 --> 03:37:15,313
Go flux

7723
03:37:17,380 --> 03:37:20,870
flight patterns right out
of Burbank Police Shit.

7724
03:37:21,520 --> 03:37:25,180
They're gonna get dropped out of a plane
and then just going to fly right into

7725
03:37:25,210 --> 03:37:27,940
13 c they've got to time it perfectly.

7726
03:37:28,810 --> 03:37:29,643
Look at this shit.

7727
03:37:29,740 --> 03:37:31,210
She's gonna get an aisle seat.

7728
03:37:31,211 --> 03:37:32,044
You Bitch,

7729
03:37:32,200 --> 03:37:32,531
dude.

7730
03:37:32,531 --> 03:37:33,351
It's going to be in his foot.

7731
03:37:33,351 --> 03:37:35,710
He's on a foam glider and
next to her the plane.

7732
03:37:36,320 --> 03:37:37,153
God Damn,

7733
03:37:37,210 --> 03:37:37,961
I think they just flew.

7734
03:37:37,961 --> 03:37:39,400
A plane went real slow,

7735
03:37:39,401 --> 03:37:41,560
but I went all the way around
the world on solar power.

7736
03:37:41,561 --> 03:37:42,850
It's like 12 miles an hour.

7737
03:37:42,851 --> 03:37:43,360
It was Whoa,

7738
03:37:43,360 --> 03:37:43,691
super,

7739
03:37:43,691 --> 03:37:44,261
super slow.

7740
03:37:44,261 --> 03:37:44,951
Took like a month,

7741
03:37:44,951 --> 03:37:45,940
but that must have sucked.

7742
03:37:46,300 --> 03:37:47,133
How'd they get food?

7743
03:37:48,250 --> 03:37:50,500
They just slowly stayed
up there with food.

7744
03:37:50,830 --> 03:37:52,540
How much shit do you
think you left up there?

7745
03:37:53,190 --> 03:37:54,670
How many times do you shit if you're,

7746
03:37:54,671 --> 03:37:55,420
if you're going,

7747
03:37:55,420 --> 03:37:56,253
it's being done.

7748
03:37:56,500 --> 03:37:56,950
If you're,

7749
03:37:56,950 --> 03:38:01,810
if you're going all the way around the
world like that and you don't have time

7750
03:38:01,811 --> 03:38:02,950
to land to take a shit,

7751
03:38:03,130 --> 03:38:06,460
how much shit do actually
drop off in that airport?

7752
03:38:06,470 --> 03:38:08,560
This shit hole in your and your outfit.

7753
03:38:08,860 --> 03:38:09,670
Here's the thing,

7754
03:38:09,670 --> 03:38:12,850
you don't have to worry about the plane
getting heavier because it's not like

7755
03:38:12,851 --> 03:38:14,350
you're eating the food
and then you're shedding.

7756
03:38:14,350 --> 03:38:15,490
The weight stays consistent.

7757
03:38:15,940 --> 03:38:18,670
Like Mass on an airplane
is in a static state,

7758
03:38:18,970 --> 03:38:22,930
like mass on an airplane never decreases
or increases unless they drop shit out

7759
03:38:22,931 --> 03:38:23,764
of the plane.

7760
03:38:24,470 --> 03:38:27,340
Solar mplus impulse to approaches.

7761
03:38:27,341 --> 03:38:28,180
Abu Dhabi.

7762
03:38:28,570 --> 03:38:29,403
Huh?

7763
03:38:30,130 --> 03:38:30,521
Wow.

7764
03:38:30,521 --> 03:38:31,390
So he really did.

7765
03:38:31,391 --> 03:38:32,710
So he had stages.

7766
03:38:32,860 --> 03:38:33,191
Okay.

7767
03:38:33,191 --> 03:38:34,090
Which makes sense.

7768
03:38:34,660 --> 03:38:35,620
Last stop.

7769
03:38:35,920 --> 03:38:39,640
So he's doing it like stop at
a top domains had solar panels.

7770
03:38:39,641 --> 03:38:40,870
Is that what it was?

7771
03:38:40,871 --> 03:38:41,960
Powered by solar power.

7772
03:38:41,961 --> 03:38:43,480
You're saying you're going
to get solar panels now?

7773
03:38:43,570 --> 03:38:44,260
Yeah.

7774
03:38:44,260 --> 03:38:44,860
When you,

7775
03:38:44,860 --> 03:38:46,040
when you do a,

7776
03:38:46,330 --> 03:38:48,130
when you put solar panels on your house,

7777
03:38:48,340 --> 03:38:51,980
do you get off the grid and now
you can get off the grid can?

7778
03:38:52,090 --> 03:38:52,600
Yes,

7779
03:38:52,600 --> 03:38:53,500
but most people,

7780
03:38:53,560 --> 03:38:55,240
most people don't know g to the city.

7781
03:38:55,600 --> 03:38:57,340
Most people the most,

7782
03:38:57,820 --> 03:39:00,130
the easiest way for you
to do it is you don't,

7783
03:39:00,131 --> 03:39:01,000
you're not independent.

7784
03:39:01,001 --> 03:39:02,200
You're still connected to the grid.

7785
03:39:02,200 --> 03:39:03,850
Like you can develop your own power.

7786
03:39:04,090 --> 03:39:04,361
Yeah.

7787
03:39:04,361 --> 03:39:04,901
Not only that,

7788
03:39:04,901 --> 03:39:05,800
you've got to talk to Brian,

7789
03:39:05,801 --> 03:39:06,670
count about this.

7790
03:39:06,940 --> 03:39:07,950
Cause Brian Cowen,

7791
03:39:07,951 --> 03:39:12,940
it was the first of us to do it and
he experienced a lot of bullshit,

7792
03:39:13,270 --> 03:39:14,290
a lot of paperwork.

7793
03:39:14,291 --> 03:39:15,910
Do you have to go through
a lot of red tape?

7794
03:39:15,940 --> 03:39:18,130
They make it very difficult
for you to get off the grid.

7795
03:39:18,550 --> 03:39:19,480
It's really interesting.

7796
03:39:19,490 --> 03:39:20,830
Can just put solar panels.

7797
03:39:21,020 --> 03:39:21,490
No,

7798
03:39:21,490 --> 03:39:21,791
no.

7799
03:39:21,791 --> 03:39:22,361
And very,

7800
03:39:22,361 --> 03:39:22,690
uh,

7801
03:39:22,690 --> 03:39:23,050
yeah,

7802
03:39:23,050 --> 03:39:23,680
he,

7803
03:39:23,680 --> 03:39:27,820
he had to go through a long process
before they let his equipment go live.

7804
03:39:28,180 --> 03:39:29,320
It's all really interesting man.

7805
03:39:29,620 --> 03:39:30,700
But in their defense,

7806
03:39:30,730 --> 03:39:31,061
here's,

7807
03:39:31,061 --> 03:39:31,900
here's like,

7808
03:39:32,050 --> 03:39:32,801
I gotta do this.

7809
03:39:32,801 --> 03:39:33,710
I hate do this people,

7810
03:39:33,711 --> 03:39:34,010
but I got

7811
03:39:34,010 --> 03:39:34,430
to do this.

7812
03:39:34,430 --> 03:39:35,140
Oh Shit.

7813
03:39:35,140 --> 03:39:35,510
Um,

7814
03:39:35,510 --> 03:39:40,070
I don't know who's installing this
electrical stuff and we live in fucking

7815
03:39:40,071 --> 03:39:43,040
California where fires
happen all the God damn time.

7816
03:39:43,280 --> 03:39:46,910
So I don't necessarily think it's totally
reasonable that someone doesn't look

7817
03:39:46,911 --> 03:39:47,744
at the wiring.

7818
03:39:47,990 --> 03:39:49,910
And make sure if you're doing
something completely radical,

7819
03:39:49,911 --> 03:39:51,420
like getting off the grid and starting a,

7820
03:39:51,710 --> 03:39:53,120
an independent power source,

7821
03:39:53,121 --> 03:39:54,440
you've got to connect to this house.

7822
03:39:54,860 --> 03:39:56,900
Let's just make sure that you
have your credentials in place.

7823
03:39:57,080 --> 03:40:00,230
Let's just make sure that everything
was done according to Code says fucking

7824
03:40:00,231 --> 03:40:02,750
houses and blow up and you don't
burn to death in your sleep.

7825
03:40:03,260 --> 03:40:03,471
You know,

7826
03:40:03,471 --> 03:40:05,480
cause like these fires
that people are having,

7827
03:40:05,720 --> 03:40:07,760
they're not controlling these
goddamn things too good.

7828
03:40:07,790 --> 03:40:08,870
There's no water man.

7829
03:40:09,060 --> 03:40:09,301
Everyone,

7830
03:40:09,301 --> 03:40:12,770
we'll where we live when we look around
and you look around at the hills,

7831
03:40:12,771 --> 03:40:16,010
like go drive up Topanga Canyon
and look at all those hills.

7832
03:40:16,130 --> 03:40:16,881
Go drive,

7833
03:40:16,881 --> 03:40:17,241
you know,

7834
03:40:17,241 --> 03:40:17,511
over,

7835
03:40:17,511 --> 03:40:19,680
I'll pass the one 18 and stall.

7836
03:40:19,810 --> 03:40:20,643
Hey,

7837
03:40:20,720 --> 03:40:24,050
so when that crazy shit like have
like if you talk to Michael Jai White,

7838
03:40:24,830 --> 03:40:25,663
nope.

7839
03:40:25,790 --> 03:40:29,390
You know he lives out there where
a that bit last big fire hit.

7840
03:40:29,510 --> 03:40:30,050
Oh Shit.

7841
03:40:30,050 --> 03:40:30,261
Yeah.

7842
03:40:30,261 --> 03:40:31,094
That was uh,

7843
03:40:31,190 --> 03:40:32,060
I was concerned.

7844
03:40:32,061 --> 03:40:33,130
I need to get ahold of that dude.

7845
03:40:33,490 --> 03:40:34,510
He was at Bella tour.

7846
03:40:34,910 --> 03:40:36,080
Not Concerned that he's hurt,

7847
03:40:36,110 --> 03:40:37,310
but concerned that maybe he,

7848
03:40:37,350 --> 03:40:39,350
his house was one of the many houses.

7849
03:40:39,440 --> 03:40:41,060
I guess he'd probably would
have heard about it in the news,

7850
03:40:41,061 --> 03:40:43,400
but a lot of people lost houses up there,

7851
03:40:43,401 --> 03:40:43,670
man.

7852
03:40:43,670 --> 03:40:45,050
A lot of people lost houses.

7853
03:40:45,230 --> 03:40:49,160
And then San Bernardino out
where a hobbyists and that area,

7854
03:40:49,310 --> 03:40:51,170
they had a gigantic fire up there.

7855
03:40:51,200 --> 03:40:52,033
Huge one.

7856
03:40:52,220 --> 03:40:54,290
They had one up near Lake Arrowhead,

7857
03:40:54,291 --> 03:40:55,760
like up away from Lake Arrowhead.

7858
03:40:55,761 --> 03:40:56,594
They had one,

7859
03:40:56,600 --> 03:40:58,460
they've had a few of these fucking things.

7860
03:40:58,460 --> 03:41:00,140
The giant one in,

7861
03:41:00,150 --> 03:41:00,700
um,

7862
03:41:00,700 --> 03:41:01,230
uh,

7863
03:41:01,230 --> 03:41:01,850
um,

7864
03:41:01,850 --> 03:41:03,950
San Bernardino or not
a Santa Barbara Rather.

7865
03:41:03,951 --> 03:41:04,784
Did you see that one?

7866
03:41:04,910 --> 03:41:07,370
But why would you get solar
panels when you give the,

7867
03:41:08,090 --> 03:41:10,490
why would you get solar
panels to give the power to?

7868
03:41:10,520 --> 03:41:14,150
Because it's more because it's more
expensive to set up an independent system.

7869
03:41:14,450 --> 03:41:16,730
So most people get to a
point where they realize,

7870
03:41:16,760 --> 03:41:16,881
oh,

7871
03:41:16,881 --> 03:41:17,451
this is good,

7872
03:41:17,451 --> 03:41:18,950
so I don't have to pay for power anymore.

7873
03:41:19,220 --> 03:41:21,470
Eventually my solar power
will pay for itself.

7874
03:41:21,800 --> 03:41:22,670
And you,

7875
03:41:22,671 --> 03:41:23,840
if you have excess power,

7876
03:41:23,841 --> 03:41:25,460
you could sell that
power back to the city.

7877
03:41:26,300 --> 03:41:27,620
But this is the question.

7878
03:41:27,850 --> 03:41:28,580
Hmm,

7879
03:41:28,580 --> 03:41:30,500
why would the city give a fuck?

7880
03:41:30,530 --> 03:41:31,251
Oh my God,

7881
03:41:31,251 --> 03:41:32,840
this guy has a house with solar panels.

7882
03:41:33,230 --> 03:41:33,501
You know,

7883
03:41:33,501 --> 03:41:35,600
let's try to get some of his
power that he's collecting.

7884
03:41:35,840 --> 03:41:36,560
Don't get old.

7885
03:41:36,560 --> 03:41:38,060
He's that central power.

7886
03:41:38,150 --> 03:41:39,380
I don't know if it's that simple.

7887
03:41:39,640 --> 03:41:40,880
Why would that even come up?

7888
03:41:40,881 --> 03:41:43,730
Like because solar panels
to give you the power,

7889
03:41:44,030 --> 03:41:44,940
that doesn't make any sense.

7890
03:41:45,170 --> 03:41:45,981
How would that come up?

7891
03:41:45,981 --> 03:41:46,101
Well,

7892
03:41:46,101 --> 03:41:46,934
let me explain.

7893
03:41:47,120 --> 03:41:48,530
As far as I think I know it,

7894
03:41:49,220 --> 03:41:50,360
the way the grid works,

7895
03:41:50,361 --> 03:41:50,671
you know the,

7896
03:41:50,671 --> 03:41:51,820
these power stations,

7897
03:41:51,870 --> 03:41:53,030
they contribute to the grid.

7898
03:41:53,540 --> 03:41:54,230
Um,

7899
03:41:54,230 --> 03:41:54,740
there's,

7900
03:41:54,740 --> 03:41:57,560
there are instances sometimes
where there's not enough power,

7901
03:41:57,590 --> 03:41:57,861
right?

7902
03:41:57,861 --> 03:42:02,450
Like in the summertime where everybody's
fucking acs going on and things below.

7903
03:42:02,480 --> 03:42:05,720
Remember those brownouts that went
out where they shut off the power for

7904
03:42:05,721 --> 03:42:06,381
different places.

7905
03:42:06,381 --> 03:42:07,214
You remember that?

7906
03:42:07,520 --> 03:42:09,770
I think what happens is
the way the grid is set up,

7907
03:42:09,771 --> 03:42:11,870
and I'm fucking completely guessing here,

7908
03:42:12,170 --> 03:42:15,680
but I would guess that if
all the power is connected,

7909
03:42:15,710 --> 03:42:16,610
if there is a grid,

7910
03:42:16,790 --> 03:42:19,190
that there's more than
one contributing factor,

7911
03:42:19,220 --> 03:42:22,130
there's more than one contributing
factor in powering the grid.

7912
03:42:22,400 --> 03:42:23,820
There's probably a power plant.

7913
03:42:23,820 --> 03:42:25,340
It was probably more than one thing.

7914
03:42:25,341 --> 03:42:25,701
It's probably,

7915
03:42:25,701 --> 03:42:30,530
it's probably a system of different
power plants that that power the grid and

7916
03:42:30,531 --> 03:42:31,470
it's possible.

7917
03:42:31,740 --> 03:42:32,910
This is total guessing,

7918
03:42:33,210 --> 03:42:38,210
but if you figure out how to make what's
essentially a solar powered generator,

7919
03:42:38,640 --> 03:42:39,001
I mean you're,

7920
03:42:39,001 --> 03:42:39,181
you're,

7921
03:42:39,181 --> 03:42:39,451
you're,

7922
03:42:39,451 --> 03:42:39,661
you're,

7923
03:42:39,661 --> 03:42:39,930
you're,

7924
03:42:39,930 --> 03:42:41,640
someone's connecting a solar,

7925
03:42:41,641 --> 03:42:46,500
extracting a device that's generating
electricity and you have an excess of it.

7926
03:42:46,740 --> 03:42:47,820
They could probably use it.

7927
03:42:48,060 --> 03:42:48,481
It's not,

7928
03:42:48,481 --> 03:42:48,840
I don't,

7929
03:42:48,840 --> 03:42:50,130
I don't know if it's that difficult.

7930
03:42:50,280 --> 03:42:51,113
I don't know.

7931
03:42:51,120 --> 03:42:55,830
How come they're not interested in any
of the power produced by a gas generators

7932
03:42:55,831 --> 03:42:56,760
that people have in their house.

7933
03:42:56,761 --> 03:42:57,810
They don't give a shit about that.

7934
03:42:58,320 --> 03:42:58,561
Well,

7935
03:42:58,561 --> 03:42:59,400
gas generators,

7936
03:42:59,401 --> 03:42:59,791
first of all,

7937
03:42:59,791 --> 03:43:01,890
they have to constantly
be restocked with gas.

7938
03:43:02,040 --> 03:43:05,640
Solar is relying on constant
power that's around all the time.

7939
03:43:05,940 --> 03:43:09,480
And gas generators are used are a
lot of rural people for backups.

7940
03:43:09,780 --> 03:43:14,240
Like I know a lady who lives in the
mountains and she's got a set up where if

7941
03:43:14,241 --> 03:43:15,180
our power goes out,

7942
03:43:15,181 --> 03:43:18,060
there's a little switch that
goes off in instantaneously.

7943
03:43:18,240 --> 03:43:19,590
She has a propane tank,

7944
03:43:19,591 --> 03:43:23,580
a giant ass propane tank that's like as
big as this fucking room and it kicks

7945
03:43:23,581 --> 03:43:24,150
in.

7946
03:43:24,150 --> 03:43:27,420
And that starts powering the
her heat cause she lives in the,

7947
03:43:27,470 --> 03:43:27,870
in the,

7948
03:43:27,870 --> 03:43:28,620
in the mountains.

7949
03:43:28,620 --> 03:43:31,410
I wonder why city cause
this a conspiracy again.

7950
03:43:31,440 --> 03:43:31,630
No,

7951
03:43:31,630 --> 03:43:31,910
I'm,

7952
03:43:31,910 --> 03:43:32,670
I'm just,

7953
03:43:32,670 --> 03:43:33,600
I'd never heard of any,

7954
03:43:34,050 --> 03:43:34,980
well the solar,

7955
03:43:35,220 --> 03:43:36,810
is there a solar panel conspiracy?

7956
03:43:36,811 --> 03:43:37,470
I don't know.

7957
03:43:37,470 --> 03:43:37,830
It just,

7958
03:43:37,830 --> 03:43:39,930
it does vary work batteries.

7959
03:43:39,960 --> 03:43:42,340
It's just very strange that

7960
03:43:44,400 --> 03:43:49,270
that would even come up solar panels for
your house to give the energy to only

7961
03:43:49,320 --> 03:43:50,790
give what you're not using.

7962
03:43:51,150 --> 03:43:51,983
It's like,

7963
03:43:52,120 --> 03:43:52,920
yeah,

7964
03:43:52,920 --> 03:43:53,640
absolutely.

7965
03:43:53,640 --> 03:43:57,990
Like you're not doing it like you're
farming electricity specifically for the

7966
03:43:57,991 --> 03:43:59,460
city and your people attending.

7967
03:43:59,520 --> 03:44:00,600
I think that is the way it is.

7968
03:44:00,630 --> 03:44:04,830
Well you're using the power and some
of it you sell back to the city,

7969
03:44:05,490 --> 03:44:07,020
but you're using the power.

7970
03:44:07,110 --> 03:44:07,440
Okay.

7971
03:44:07,440 --> 03:44:09,090
That's going to be your source of power.

7972
03:44:09,250 --> 03:44:09,661
Positive.

7973
03:44:09,661 --> 03:44:10,040
Cause I,

7974
03:44:10,040 --> 03:44:11,760
I pretty sure wrong,

7975
03:44:11,790 --> 03:44:12,571
I could be wrong,

7976
03:44:12,571 --> 03:44:16,530
but it could be that somebody
could make it as a follower.

7977
03:44:16,690 --> 03:44:19,770
They're going to give you the power of
the all hooked up with w we're going to

7978
03:44:19,771 --> 03:44:22,440
give you the three electricity and then
we're going to pay you a little extra,

7979
03:44:22,680 --> 03:44:23,640
collect us shit.

7980
03:44:23,820 --> 03:44:24,390
Boom.

7981
03:44:24,390 --> 03:44:27,920
We want that solar shit and we'll
give you whatever for this process.

7982
03:44:27,930 --> 03:44:31,920
Don't you think there's going to be
solar farms if it's profitable for you?

7983
03:44:31,921 --> 03:44:33,330
Because then you could
just keep your plugs.

7984
03:44:33,331 --> 03:44:34,470
You don't have to replug everything.

7985
03:44:34,560 --> 03:44:35,480
Just give us all that.

7986
03:44:35,481 --> 03:44:36,660
If you don't replug anything,

7987
03:44:36,661 --> 03:44:37,500
you don't change anything.

7988
03:44:37,650 --> 03:44:38,101
What does it say?

7989
03:44:38,101 --> 03:44:41,070
The Sun shines on solar panels
generated by DC electricity.

7990
03:44:41,071 --> 03:44:44,910
The DC electricity is fed into a
solar inverter converts at 240 volts.

7991
03:44:44,911 --> 03:44:45,870
50 Hertz,

7992
03:44:46,250 --> 03:44:49,830
a 240 volt ac electricity is used to
power the appliances in your home.

7993
03:44:49,831 --> 03:44:50,340
Certain posts,

7994
03:44:50,340 --> 03:44:53,070
electricity is fed back
into the main grid.

7995
03:44:53,430 --> 03:44:54,263
There you go.

7996
03:44:54,620 --> 03:44:56,850
Trample because this is like,

7997
03:44:56,870 --> 03:44:58,680
it's like a renewable resource.

7998
03:44:58,681 --> 03:44:59,790
It's a constant resource.

7999
03:44:59,791 --> 03:45:04,791
So that house right there has a solar
panel energy from the solar panels back to

8000
03:45:04,831 --> 03:45:05,250
the grid?

8001
03:45:05,250 --> 03:45:05,950
No.

8002
03:45:05,950 --> 03:45:06,783
Okay.

8003
03:45:06,810 --> 03:45:09,060
It's trends surplus.

8004
03:45:09,090 --> 03:45:10,080
See the bottom part,

8005
03:45:10,530 --> 03:45:14,850
the last.it says surplus
electricity is fed into the back,

8006
03:45:14,851 --> 03:45:15,684
into the main grid.

8007
03:45:15,780 --> 03:45:18,030
Would that means is
whatever they don't need.

8008
03:45:18,270 --> 03:45:21,240
So if they generate a ton of
electricity and they don't need all the

8009
03:45:21,241 --> 03:45:21,721
electricity,

8010
03:45:21,721 --> 03:45:25,110
like say if they have a lot of solar
panels but they only have a two bedroom

8011
03:45:25,111 --> 03:45:27,660
house or a one bedroom
house and it's just,

8012
03:45:27,661 --> 03:45:27,871
you know,

8013
03:45:27,871 --> 03:45:29,160
a small comfortable place.

8014
03:45:29,170 --> 03:45:30,190
They don't need all

8015
03:45:30,190 --> 03:45:30,791
that power.

8016
03:45:30,791 --> 03:45:33,250
They have too much of it is choosing.

8017
03:45:33,251 --> 03:45:36,950
Man Did they want that power man,

8018
03:45:37,140 --> 03:45:37,690
you got that.

8019
03:45:37,690 --> 03:45:38,590
You got an extra power.

8020
03:45:38,650 --> 03:45:39,490
There's not what it is,

8021
03:45:39,491 --> 03:45:40,150
man.

8022
03:45:40,150 --> 03:45:41,050
You got to get rid of it.

8023
03:45:41,060 --> 03:45:41,620
Sounds crazy.

8024
03:45:41,620 --> 03:45:45,280
I think it's like too much and
solar panels have too much power.

8025
03:45:45,310 --> 03:45:45,461
Yeah,

8026
03:45:45,461 --> 03:45:48,510
I think you can generate too
much for what you could store.

8027
03:45:48,630 --> 03:45:49,211
That makes sense.

8028
03:45:49,211 --> 03:45:49,840
Then if you could,

8029
03:45:49,840 --> 03:45:50,860
and it's a problem like shit,

8030
03:45:50,861 --> 03:45:51,550
we got to,

8031
03:45:51,550 --> 03:45:54,700
we can't do this because then we collect
too much and then it becomes a hazard

8032
03:45:54,830 --> 03:45:55,661
towing the city goes,

8033
03:45:55,661 --> 03:45:56,380
okay,

8034
03:45:56,380 --> 03:45:56,860
you could,

8035
03:45:56,860 --> 03:45:58,210
you could give us the extra,

8036
03:45:58,450 --> 03:45:58,631
you know,

8037
03:45:58,631 --> 03:46:01,960
as long as we care about the
people and we want to go solar,

8038
03:46:02,110 --> 03:46:02,801
we want to go solar.

8039
03:46:02,801 --> 03:46:05,800
So we'll take that extra shit you
got and we'll give you a little bit.

8040
03:46:05,820 --> 03:46:07,210
We'll get a couple of dollars for it too.

8041
03:46:07,420 --> 03:46:08,170
But don't,

8042
03:46:08,170 --> 03:46:09,003
don't stop.

8043
03:46:09,190 --> 03:46:10,240
Don't stop the cause.

8044
03:46:10,450 --> 03:46:11,283
It's all about

8045
03:46:12,460 --> 03:46:16,780
Eddie's having a conspiracy conversation
with some imaginary executive is like a

8046
03:46:16,781 --> 03:46:18,400
dude selling weed.

8047
03:46:19,960 --> 03:46:20,950
It's like a dude settle.

8048
03:46:20,951 --> 03:46:21,910
We'd Yo yo Yo Yo,

8049
03:46:21,911 --> 03:46:22,990
I know you situation man.

8050
03:46:22,991 --> 03:46:23,350
Right?

8051
03:46:23,350 --> 03:46:24,240
You can't pay for Nate.

8052
03:46:24,300 --> 03:46:25,133
What'd you want a name?

8053
03:46:25,180 --> 03:46:28,450
So I'm gonna give you an a and this is
what I'm going to do and I'm going to

8054
03:46:28,451 --> 03:46:31,300
give you three days and instead
of the eighth being 50 bucks,

8055
03:46:31,301 --> 03:46:32,530
it's going to be 65 bucks.

8056
03:46:32,531 --> 03:46:32,801
Dog.

8057
03:46:32,801 --> 03:46:33,850
What are you going to get it right now?

8058
03:46:34,540 --> 03:46:36,250
I want you to buy a Mama House.

8059
03:46:37,120 --> 03:46:38,320
Do you gotta get into this?

8060
03:46:38,321 --> 03:46:39,154
We gained,

8061
03:46:39,310 --> 03:46:41,650
we gained is amazing dog.

8062
03:46:42,220 --> 03:46:43,053
It's amazing.

8063
03:46:43,070 --> 03:46:44,530
Why don't we in the weed game,

8064
03:46:44,560 --> 03:46:47,080
we should have our own
want to stay out of jail.

8065
03:46:47,350 --> 03:46:48,120
Bravo.

8066
03:46:48,120 --> 03:46:49,170
We need to waste point.

8067
03:46:49,180 --> 03:46:50,320
We could have our own dispensary,

8068
03:46:50,321 --> 03:46:50,740
man.

8069
03:46:50,740 --> 03:46:51,190
Well,

8070
03:46:51,190 --> 03:46:53,260
I think honestly it's too much work,

8071
03:46:53,290 --> 03:46:54,190
Joe and Eddie's.

8072
03:46:54,280 --> 03:46:55,420
It's too much work they can't use.

8073
03:46:55,450 --> 03:46:56,141
Here's the other thing.

8074
03:46:56,141 --> 03:46:59,290
He can't use credit cards and a lot of
these places still isn't not the case or

8075
03:46:59,291 --> 03:47:04,291
the transfer and large amounts of cash
or hiring a ex military guys [inaudible]

8076
03:47:04,420 --> 03:47:09,420
guide to or or multimillionaire guy to
use our face would beg for more than one

8077
03:47:10,571 --> 03:47:11,230
picture.

8078
03:47:11,230 --> 03:47:14,440
They want that one money shot tipped
the hang in the front of me and you like

8079
03:47:14,441 --> 03:47:15,550
smoking a joint or something.

8080
03:47:15,700 --> 03:47:16,690
Well I'll do that.

8081
03:47:16,870 --> 03:47:18,040
But that's a Cheech and Chong do,

8082
03:47:18,041 --> 03:47:18,280
right?

8083
03:47:18,280 --> 03:47:22,350
They'll do like some sell some
fucking rolling stone here.

8084
03:47:22,430 --> 03:47:23,263
We need that.

8085
03:47:23,830 --> 03:47:26,590
We'd have to remember when Tommy
Chong got put in the pokey.

8086
03:47:26,830 --> 03:47:27,470
Yeah.

8087
03:47:27,470 --> 03:47:28,750
I think those things are gongs,

8088
03:47:28,751 --> 03:47:29,584
bro.

8089
03:47:29,650 --> 03:47:30,490
I hope so.

8090
03:47:30,670 --> 03:47:31,031
But you know what?

8091
03:47:31,031 --> 03:47:31,781
I was really worried,

8092
03:47:31,781 --> 03:47:32,080
man.

8093
03:47:32,080 --> 03:47:33,760
I was really worried of Ted Cruz got in.

8094
03:47:34,000 --> 03:47:37,300
I was like the nuttiness could
like rise to a whole new level.

8095
03:47:37,720 --> 03:47:39,280
Like if you give people a bar,

8096
03:47:39,281 --> 03:47:41,290
and this is what I've been
saying that I like about Obama,

8097
03:47:41,500 --> 03:47:43,210
whatever he did that people don't like,

8098
03:47:43,211 --> 03:47:43,810
I understand.

8099
03:47:43,810 --> 03:47:44,320
I get it.

8100
03:47:44,320 --> 03:47:44,980
I'm with Ya.

8101
03:47:44,980 --> 03:47:45,910
I'm not even saying that.

8102
03:47:46,060 --> 03:47:48,550
I'm not talking about his performance
as far as like what he's done,

8103
03:47:48,551 --> 03:47:51,070
foreign policy was talking
about like what he represents.

8104
03:47:51,340 --> 03:47:52,660
Like when you seen him on television,

8105
03:47:52,661 --> 03:47:53,381
he's well spoken,

8106
03:47:53,381 --> 03:47:54,101
he's articulate,

8107
03:47:54,101 --> 03:47:54,970
he went to Harvard,

8108
03:47:55,270 --> 03:47:56,320
he's a bright guy.

8109
03:47:56,470 --> 03:47:59,590
He seems like a guy that you would
think would be like one of the smartest

8110
03:47:59,591 --> 03:48:01,330
people that you're ever
going to come across.

8111
03:48:01,480 --> 03:48:02,800
Makes sense that he's running shit.

8112
03:48:03,160 --> 03:48:03,640
You know,

8113
03:48:03,640 --> 03:48:07,090
if a guy like Ted Cruz or a lot of
these other people that wanted to be

8114
03:48:07,091 --> 03:48:07,924
president,

8115
03:48:07,930 --> 03:48:12,930
especially people with Wacky fucking
religious ideas that just don't jive with

8116
03:48:13,031 --> 03:48:14,230
anything that we know.

8117
03:48:14,620 --> 03:48:15,311
If it fills,

8118
03:48:15,311 --> 03:48:18,250
people get into a position where they
have massive amounts of influence.

8119
03:48:18,430 --> 03:48:20,080
People start getting really confused.

8120
03:48:20,410 --> 03:48:22,780
And I didn't used to think that until the,

8121
03:48:23,110 --> 03:48:26,560
obviously I've learned cause I'm older
but I didn't think that that much until

8122
03:48:26,561 --> 03:48:27,394
the Bush,

8123
03:48:27,890 --> 03:48:29,520
the Bush administration and then the,

8124
03:48:29,750 --> 03:48:32,300
the nine 11 attacks maybe go whoa.

8125
03:48:32,301 --> 03:48:37,070
Like our consciousness is so much more
fragile than I thought it was because I

8126
03:48:37,071 --> 03:48:41,930
thought what we were like as Americans
in the nineties before the a nine 11

8127
03:48:41,931 --> 03:48:43,130
attacks during the Clinton thing.

8128
03:48:43,310 --> 03:48:47,570
I thought we were ridiculous in some
ways because of the whole Clinton Monica

8129
03:48:47,570 --> 03:48:50,300
Lewinsky thing and then there was
definitely some fuckery going on in other

8130
03:48:50,301 --> 03:48:53,540
countries but it didn't seem
like the world was unsafe.

8131
03:48:54,170 --> 03:48:55,550
Like it seemed like the world,

8132
03:48:55,551 --> 03:48:59,540
the world felt like we got over that Cold
War shit with the Russians were going

8133
03:48:59,541 --> 03:49:00,111
to be okay.

8134
03:49:00,111 --> 03:49:01,550
The world felt safe.

8135
03:49:01,880 --> 03:49:02,990
Like you had this guy,

8136
03:49:03,200 --> 03:49:05,240
even if he's full of shit and
he's getting his dick sucked,

8137
03:49:05,420 --> 03:49:06,290
listen to him talk.

8138
03:49:06,380 --> 03:49:07,670
He's obviously smart as fuck.

8139
03:49:07,880 --> 03:49:08,300
You know,

8140
03:49:08,300 --> 03:49:09,133
like maybe some,

8141
03:49:09,380 --> 03:49:09,621
you know,

8142
03:49:09,621 --> 03:49:13,790
maybe some people that are crazy get
to the point where their president,

8143
03:49:13,940 --> 03:49:15,770
some whip your dick out type dudes.

8144
03:49:15,890 --> 03:49:18,680
Maybe people get crazy and they still
get to the point where the president,

8145
03:49:19,010 --> 03:49:20,600
but obviously a very,

8146
03:49:20,601 --> 03:49:21,440
very smart guy,

8147
03:49:21,441 --> 03:49:22,340
very well spoken.

8148
03:49:22,730 --> 03:49:26,540
And then the Bush presidency came
along and it was so transparent.

8149
03:49:26,960 --> 03:49:30,860
All of it was so transparent
and then the the chain have,

8150
03:49:30,861 --> 03:49:34,790
Cheney was essentially run the show and
he was always in a bunker and everyone,

8151
03:49:34,800 --> 03:49:36,230
Cheney was always in the bunker.

8152
03:49:36,860 --> 03:49:38,000
He was always in a bunker.

8153
03:49:38,210 --> 03:49:40,940
There was always talking about Cheney's
hidden away somewhere in a fucking

8154
03:49:40,941 --> 03:49:41,540
bunker.

8155
03:49:41,540 --> 03:49:44,900
And there was that Wolfowitz dude hanging
around and all these other fucking

8156
03:49:44,901 --> 03:49:46,790
Donald Rumsfeld type characters,

8157
03:49:47,120 --> 03:49:48,500
all these merchants,

8158
03:49:49,040 --> 03:49:53,210
all these like war merchants
there were all swarming around.

8159
03:49:53,480 --> 03:49:58,070
And then we're at war like all of a sudden
were constantly at war for like this

8160
03:49:58,071 --> 03:49:58,791
massive,

8161
03:49:58,791 --> 03:50:03,380
massive amount of time and it's still
hasn't let up all these years later,

8162
03:50:03,710 --> 03:50:03,980
dude,

8163
03:50:03,980 --> 03:50:08,060
nine 11 was 15 years ago.

8164
03:50:09,320 --> 03:50:13,310
People jumping off buildings and
just smashing into the streets.

8165
03:50:13,670 --> 03:50:14,530
That just happened.

8166
03:50:14,570 --> 03:50:16,000
It was 2001 right?

8167
03:50:16,130 --> 03:50:18,920
2001 that's 15 years ago.

8168
03:50:20,390 --> 03:50:21,530
That's crazy.

8169
03:50:22,010 --> 03:50:26,990
Like we've been in a perpetual state
of war for a sophomore's entire life.

8170
03:50:27,600 --> 03:50:28,220
Yup.

8171
03:50:28,220 --> 03:50:29,420
Sophomore in high school.

8172
03:50:29,421 --> 03:50:31,640
Some kid who's kids that are,

8173
03:50:31,641 --> 03:50:35,090
I think freshman this year are learning
about it through history books.

8174
03:50:35,091 --> 03:50:37,630
They didn't experience it in
one second of their life or so.

8175
03:50:37,631 --> 03:50:38,360
Of course.

8176
03:50:38,360 --> 03:50:39,051
Yeah for sure.

8177
03:50:39,051 --> 03:50:40,520
Well that most people that are even,

8178
03:50:40,521 --> 03:50:40,821
you know,

8179
03:50:40,821 --> 03:50:43,370
10 and above their parents would probably
going to shield them from it for the

8180
03:50:43,371 --> 03:50:46,100
most part when it's
happening 16 years ago.

8181
03:50:46,101 --> 03:50:51,101
So anybody younger than 26
barely understands what happened.

8182
03:50:51,440 --> 03:50:52,273
Barely.

8183
03:50:53,040 --> 03:50:54,860
That's fucking crazy.

8184
03:50:54,890 --> 03:50:56,480
What a change of the world.

8185
03:50:56,600 --> 03:50:58,580
So I get real nervous now.

8186
03:50:59,030 --> 03:51:03,680
I get real nervous cause I just don't
think that the way we're doing it right

8187
03:51:03,681 --> 03:51:07,520
now is appealing to anybody
that we really want to run us.

8188
03:51:08,090 --> 03:51:11,180
There's a few people like
Gary Johnson makes sense.

8189
03:51:11,181 --> 03:51:13,190
That libertarian guy that we had in here,

8190
03:51:13,640 --> 03:51:14,090
he's,

8191
03:51:14,090 --> 03:51:19,090
he seems like a real person and he has
real experience like running New Mexico.

8192
03:51:19,880 --> 03:51:20,810
I don't know enough.

8193
03:51:20,840 --> 03:51:22,880
I just don't know enough about politics.

8194
03:51:23,300 --> 03:51:25,320
I don't know enough to really mean.

8195
03:51:25,321 --> 03:51:26,010
I think you have to

8196
03:51:26,010 --> 03:51:27,570
know what the way you know Jujitsu.

8197
03:51:27,900 --> 03:51:29,340
I think you have to really know it.

8198
03:51:29,370 --> 03:51:33,270
Like if some dude who's like a blue belt
in Japanese Jujitsu starts talking to

8199
03:51:33,271 --> 03:51:34,980
you about Russ locks human be like pitch,

8200
03:51:35,460 --> 03:51:36,060
you know that's,

8201
03:51:36,060 --> 03:51:37,050
that's what I am.

8202
03:51:37,051 --> 03:51:38,730
Really what I'm talking about politics.

8203
03:51:38,731 --> 03:51:42,870
I have like a skeletal understanding
of the way the system works,

8204
03:51:42,871 --> 03:51:44,340
but I'm a for stripe white belt.

8205
03:51:44,940 --> 03:51:45,630
Exactly.

8206
03:51:45,630 --> 03:51:46,500
When to get my blue.

8207
03:51:46,710 --> 03:51:47,700
I would have had it already,

8208
03:51:47,701 --> 03:51:50,460
but I might have a yell about
if we're ignoring karate.

8209
03:51:50,640 --> 03:51:53,940
I might've just gotten my belt after
I got my yellow stripe and I was super

8210
03:51:53,941 --> 03:51:56,520
pumped filing my belt
wasn't just playing white,

8211
03:51:56,640 --> 03:51:57,750
but that's where it ends.

8212
03:51:58,050 --> 03:52:00,840
That's where it ends and so like
if I'm talking to some yellow belt,

8213
03:52:00,841 --> 03:52:03,000
they're trying to talk to them
about effective striking techniques.

8214
03:52:03,010 --> 03:52:04,590
I get real irritable.

8215
03:52:04,940 --> 03:52:05,521
I'm sure.

8216
03:52:05,521 --> 03:52:05,850
Listen,

8217
03:52:05,850 --> 03:52:08,030
when you ask someone's rank
and Jujitsu and they go,

8218
03:52:08,040 --> 03:52:09,070
I'm going to get my blue.

8219
03:52:09,130 --> 03:52:09,341
I'm going,

8220
03:52:09,341 --> 03:52:10,174
I'm going to test

8221
03:52:11,680 --> 03:52:12,513
bastard.

8222
03:52:12,810 --> 03:52:14,550
I'm going to test for my purple blue it.

8223
03:52:14,551 --> 03:52:17,670
Jiu Jitsu might be one of the only
things that you really cannot possibly

8224
03:52:17,671 --> 03:52:19,380
understand what's happening
if you don't do it.

8225
03:52:19,680 --> 03:52:20,640
If you've never done it,

8226
03:52:20,641 --> 03:52:22,350
you just are not going
to know what's going on.

8227
03:52:22,710 --> 03:52:23,610
You're just not going to know.

8228
03:52:23,730 --> 03:52:26,700
You could have like a little bit of an
understanding like here's an Armbar.

8229
03:52:26,910 --> 03:52:29,010
I've seen this transition
to triangle before.

8230
03:52:29,220 --> 03:52:29,551
Oh,

8231
03:52:29,551 --> 03:52:33,780
I've heard it said that if you commit to
hard on that Kamora and you don't have

8232
03:52:33,781 --> 03:52:34,770
control of the legs,

8233
03:52:34,950 --> 03:52:36,870
the guy can counter with
the far side arm bar.

8234
03:52:37,230 --> 03:52:39,810
There's a lot of people like have these
things in their head that they know to

8235
03:52:39,811 --> 03:52:40,590
be true,

8236
03:52:40,590 --> 03:52:41,940
but they don't know what
the way you know it,

8237
03:52:41,970 --> 03:52:43,770
they're not going to know
it the way you know it.

8238
03:52:43,870 --> 03:52:45,090
Just there's just no way.

8239
03:52:45,120 --> 03:52:47,310
They're not going to see
things that you're seeing your,

8240
03:52:47,311 --> 03:52:50,520
when you watch and Damien Maia Choco
choke out Carlos condit tonight.

8241
03:52:50,760 --> 03:52:52,470
You're going through the path with them,

8242
03:52:52,680 --> 03:52:53,130
right?

8243
03:52:53,130 --> 03:52:53,941
Like when you're seeing it.

8244
03:52:53,941 --> 03:52:54,241
Yeah.

8245
03:52:54,241 --> 03:52:55,074
You know the path.

8246
03:52:55,860 --> 03:52:58,080
A lot of other people are
watching it and they're like,

8247
03:52:58,290 --> 03:52:59,130
they're in the middle of it.

8248
03:52:59,131 --> 03:52:59,700
He's on top.

8249
03:52:59,700 --> 03:52:59,910
Yeah.

8250
03:52:59,910 --> 03:53:00,743
Smashed Him.

8251
03:53:00,870 --> 03:53:01,770
He's getting all on him.

8252
03:53:01,771 --> 03:53:02,221
He's on.

8253
03:53:02,221 --> 03:53:02,480
Um,

8254
03:53:02,480 --> 03:53:03,313
so think about,

8255
03:53:03,620 --> 03:53:07,890
think about how few people
can watch Damien Maia.

8256
03:53:07,950 --> 03:53:10,350
Choke out Carlos condit and see the path,

8257
03:53:10,500 --> 03:53:11,880
see the path he's going to take.

8258
03:53:12,150 --> 03:53:14,010
Watch him executed flawlessly.

8259
03:53:14,490 --> 03:53:15,900
See this Jujitsu,

8260
03:53:15,930 --> 03:53:16,800
not just in like,

8261
03:53:16,801 --> 03:53:17,281
oh my God,

8262
03:53:17,281 --> 03:53:18,000
what is he doing?

8263
03:53:18,000 --> 03:53:20,070
But see every single step of the way.

8264
03:53:20,520 --> 03:53:21,090
Well,

8265
03:53:21,090 --> 03:53:24,000
I think that there's just like Jujitsu,

8266
03:53:24,270 --> 03:53:28,170
that's just the case with every fucking
thing that exists in this goddamn world

8267
03:53:28,440 --> 03:53:29,131
somewhere.

8268
03:53:29,131 --> 03:53:33,000
Someone is probably studied all their
life to try to figure out how microphones

8269
03:53:33,001 --> 03:53:33,590
work.

8270
03:53:33,590 --> 03:53:33,961
You were.

8271
03:53:33,961 --> 03:53:36,750
I have put virtually no
thought into it whatsoever,

8272
03:53:36,840 --> 03:53:38,250
but luckily somebody did.

8273
03:53:38,370 --> 03:53:39,540
So we have this microphone.

8274
03:53:39,780 --> 03:53:41,280
That's how I feel about everything.

8275
03:53:41,310 --> 03:53:43,350
That's how I feel about astronomy.

8276
03:53:43,410 --> 03:53:44,810
That's how I feel about the,

8277
03:53:44,811 --> 03:53:46,230
the Lunar Rover on the moon.

8278
03:53:46,350 --> 03:53:47,970
That's how I feel about all these things.

8279
03:53:48,210 --> 03:53:51,930
Like there's gotta be somewhere out there
that's gotta be mad as fuck that two

8280
03:53:51,931 --> 03:53:52,321
dumps.

8281
03:53:52,321 --> 03:53:56,190
Donors are talking about whether or not
the rover is legit and these fucking

8282
03:53:56,191 --> 03:53:57,660
guys been working out of their whole life.

8283
03:53:57,661 --> 03:53:59,040
They get scientific papers.

8284
03:53:59,220 --> 03:54:01,920
They like pulling their hair out in the
middle of the night doing an Adderall,

8285
03:54:01,921 --> 03:54:04,170
trying to figure out how to
make the calculations perfectly.

8286
03:54:04,290 --> 03:54:07,400
So this giant inflatable
ball encompass or,

8287
03:54:08,000 --> 03:54:11,370
and what'd they do with
zinc and cover what happens?

8288
03:54:11,610 --> 03:54:13,350
I think there's a giant inflatable ball.

8289
03:54:13,351 --> 03:54:14,430
I don't know if they did it this way,

8290
03:54:14,700 --> 03:54:17,220
that encases the entire machine.

8291
03:54:17,250 --> 03:54:18,180
I saw that cartoon.

8292
03:54:18,240 --> 03:54:19,100
Is that what it was supposed to be?

8293
03:54:19,101 --> 03:54:19,934
It was a cartoon,

8294
03:54:20,100 --> 03:54:21,150
but it's not real.

8295
03:54:21,270 --> 03:54:23,100
Of course they should
definitely send back some video.

8296
03:54:23,200 --> 03:54:24,130
They don't have any video

8297
03:54:24,130 --> 03:54:24,921
of that dude.

8298
03:54:24,921 --> 03:54:25,810
It's people listening right now,

8299
03:54:25,820 --> 03:54:26,653
mad at us.

8300
03:54:26,830 --> 03:54:28,160
It's just proving people.

8301
03:54:28,161 --> 03:54:28,780
Your wife,

8302
03:54:28,780 --> 03:54:30,040
too many lies that you're like,

8303
03:54:30,041 --> 03:54:30,520
Yo bro,

8304
03:54:30,520 --> 03:54:31,450
that UFC bro,

8305
03:54:31,600 --> 03:54:31,841
bro,

8306
03:54:31,841 --> 03:54:33,190
that shit's fake as fuck dude.

8307
03:54:33,250 --> 03:54:34,750
That's just like WWE.

8308
03:54:34,840 --> 03:54:35,890
It's WWE.

8309
03:54:35,891 --> 03:54:38,440
But they've got some other tricks up
their sleeve and I mean occasionally they

8310
03:54:38,441 --> 03:54:39,160
hit each other,

8311
03:54:39,160 --> 03:54:39,631
but dude,

8312
03:54:39,631 --> 03:54:40,270
trust me,

8313
03:54:40,270 --> 03:54:41,103
it's all fake.

8314
03:54:41,260 --> 03:54:42,130
So this is what it was.

8315
03:54:42,370 --> 03:54:43,181
If someone said that,

8316
03:54:43,181 --> 03:54:46,210
so parachutes came down
thin ass atmosphere,

8317
03:54:46,211 --> 03:54:46,480
right?

8318
03:54:46,480 --> 03:54:47,560
There's almost no atmosphere.

8319
03:54:47,561 --> 03:54:49,060
They're actual footage right here.

8320
03:54:49,330 --> 03:54:54,330
So it drops and then explodes into these
big inflates into these big bouncing

8321
03:54:55,151 --> 03:54:55,960
balls.

8322
03:54:55,960 --> 03:54:57,040
If that was in a movie,

8323
03:54:57,041 --> 03:54:57,874
you'd be pissed.

8324
03:54:58,150 --> 03:55:01,660
And then it has these things
that try to slow it down.

8325
03:55:01,661 --> 03:55:04,060
These jets that shoot down
and then it hits the ground.

8326
03:55:04,061 --> 03:55:04,894
It bounces.

8327
03:55:06,010 --> 03:55:10,210
This looks like the shittiest
fucking place to move to of all time.

8328
03:55:10,330 --> 03:55:11,530
That's what Maurice looks like.

8329
03:55:11,690 --> 03:55:12,700
It looks like the desert.

8330
03:55:13,120 --> 03:55:14,440
It looks way worse than the desert.

8331
03:55:14,441 --> 03:55:15,270
Cause you can go to the desert,

8332
03:55:15,270 --> 03:55:18,250
get gas as a fucking highway going
through it and he'd stop swearing,

8333
03:55:18,320 --> 03:55:19,153
taking shit.

8334
03:55:19,270 --> 03:55:20,720
[inaudible]

8335
03:55:22,170 --> 03:55:23,800
humans and you know,

8336
03:55:23,890 --> 03:55:24,970
very few spots.

8337
03:55:24,971 --> 03:55:25,930
If you land on earth,

8338
03:55:25,931 --> 03:55:28,240
you'd land on this
probably more than a city.

8339
03:55:28,241 --> 03:55:28,890
A city is.

8340
03:55:28,890 --> 03:55:29,200
Fuck,

8341
03:55:29,200 --> 03:55:30,700
there's hardly no cities on this planet,

8342
03:55:30,820 --> 03:55:31,061
Dude.

8343
03:55:31,061 --> 03:55:34,540
I was camping in Nevada high
country just a week ago.

8344
03:55:34,570 --> 03:55:35,590
Get on a plane and look down.

8345
03:55:35,591 --> 03:55:37,090
You don't see that many cities.

8346
03:55:37,091 --> 03:55:37,440
It's a,

8347
03:55:37,440 --> 03:55:39,610
it was way more barren
wasteland than anything.

8348
03:55:39,910 --> 03:55:42,100
Well when you're in the
Nevada high country,

8349
03:55:42,101 --> 03:55:44,800
you realize there's a reason why nobody
fucking build houses out of here.

8350
03:55:45,130 --> 03:55:47,020
Like it's a hard scrabble world.

8351
03:55:47,170 --> 03:55:52,170
We were there in August and it's like
a hundred degrees during the day.

8352
03:55:52,900 --> 03:55:53,950
It gets hot as fuck.

8353
03:55:53,980 --> 03:55:57,190
You got to bring a lot of water with you
and then at night it gets down to the

8354
03:55:57,190 --> 03:55:58,570
30s it was freezing,

8355
03:55:58,840 --> 03:55:59,880
freezing at night.

8356
03:55:59,881 --> 03:56:03,010
I mean you freeze your fucking Dick
off and there ain't shit up there.

8357
03:56:03,260 --> 03:56:05,110
Just a bunch of deer and some rabbits,

8358
03:56:05,740 --> 03:56:07,510
some occasional streams.

8359
03:56:08,080 --> 03:56:10,240
The sage bushes terminator right there.

8360
03:56:10,510 --> 03:56:12,790
Are you looking at the video right
now because people are listening.

8361
03:56:12,791 --> 03:56:13,960
They don't know what we're talking about.

8362
03:56:14,200 --> 03:56:18,100
We're looking at the Mars rover landing
on when you bravo doesn't believe in it.

8363
03:56:18,220 --> 03:56:18,401
Well,

8364
03:56:18,401 --> 03:56:19,300
this is not real.

8365
03:56:19,301 --> 03:56:19,960
This is a CGI.

8366
03:56:19,960 --> 03:56:20,111
Well,

8367
03:56:20,111 --> 03:56:20,944
this is CGI.

8368
03:56:20,950 --> 03:56:23,560
It's they have to explain where
they are spending all their money.

8369
03:56:23,650 --> 03:56:24,483
I like it.

8370
03:56:24,550 --> 03:56:26,410
They're making this
little robot arm come up.

8371
03:56:26,490 --> 03:56:27,610
This is a switch for sure.

8372
03:56:27,760 --> 03:56:29,380
If I was going to build
a little robot arm,

8373
03:56:29,410 --> 03:56:32,740
I'd make it bounced all over the
fucking surface of the desert.

8374
03:56:33,580 --> 03:56:36,580
That's how he imagined your iPhone was
stuck in the middle of that ball and it

8375
03:56:36,581 --> 03:56:38,500
bounced for sure it wouldn't work.

8376
03:56:39,490 --> 03:56:42,370
This thing is robust strong wiring.

8377
03:56:42,550 --> 03:56:46,990
Imagine somebody fucked up one little
wire and they sh they landed on the moon.

8378
03:56:46,991 --> 03:56:47,801
That's happened before,

8379
03:56:47,801 --> 03:56:48,634
hasn't it?

8380
03:56:48,700 --> 03:56:51,850
Haven't they shot things all the way to
the moon and forgot they turned them on

8381
03:56:52,120 --> 03:56:54,550
or a all the way to
Mars and it didn't work.

8382
03:56:55,240 --> 03:56:56,140
They don't always work.

8383
03:56:57,340 --> 03:56:58,173
Where's the

8384
03:57:00,250 --> 03:57:01,083
pops back on?

8385
03:57:01,260 --> 03:57:02,093
Yup.

8386
03:57:02,200 --> 03:57:03,033
Oh

8387
03:57:04,090 --> 03:57:07,000
well the youtube video is the
most important piece of evidence.

8388
03:57:07,510 --> 03:57:09,930
Any kind of weekend we should cherish.

8389
03:57:09,940 --> 03:57:11,850
She could be on Vimeo as as well.

8390
03:57:11,880 --> 03:57:12,430
My space,

8391
03:57:12,430 --> 03:57:12,770
it doesn't.

8392
03:57:12,770 --> 03:57:13,630
USTREAM is good.

8393
03:57:14,080 --> 03:57:16,000
I like a Geo cities websites.

8394
03:57:16,001 --> 03:57:16,834
This is my favorite.

8395
03:57:16,840 --> 03:57:17,890
They have the best info.

8396
03:57:19,420 --> 03:57:20,253
Angel Fire.

8397
03:57:20,680 --> 03:57:21,500
Yeah.

8398
03:57:21,500 --> 03:57:24,860
It's interesting when you look at
all the different websites today,

8399
03:57:24,890 --> 03:57:26,300
like how many websites are there?

8400
03:57:26,390 --> 03:57:27,860
If you had to guess how many,

8401
03:57:27,861 --> 03:57:30,620
like different places could
you go on the Internet today?

8402
03:57:30,621 --> 03:57:31,454
Right now?

8403
03:57:32,210 --> 03:57:33,043
Hmm.

8404
03:57:33,230 --> 03:57:33,860
What makes sense?

8405
03:57:33,860 --> 03:57:34,693
I bet that's right.

8406
03:57:35,200 --> 03:57:35,650
Be Higher.

8407
03:57:35,650 --> 03:57:38,290
I was thinking just I think last night
there was a time on the Internet,

8408
03:57:38,320 --> 03:57:39,860
not that long ago where you take,

8409
03:57:39,880 --> 03:57:41,960
you'd have seen most stuff
that has come through like,

8410
03:57:41,980 --> 03:57:42,221
Oh yeah,

8411
03:57:42,221 --> 03:57:42,770
I've seen that.

8412
03:57:42,770 --> 03:57:45,240
I've seen that picture like
you'd need to see a boobs.

8413
03:57:45,250 --> 03:57:45,491
You'd be like,

8414
03:57:45,491 --> 03:57:46,121
I know there's boots.

8415
03:57:46,121 --> 03:57:46,511
Those are,

8416
03:57:46,511 --> 03:57:48,460
but now there's just so
much shit coming through.

8417
03:57:48,461 --> 03:57:49,870
Literally every single day.

8418
03:57:50,230 --> 03:57:50,920
You can't even,

8419
03:57:50,920 --> 03:57:52,910
you couldn't catch up if
you want to make it up

8420
03:57:53,060 --> 03:57:53,340
point.

8421
03:57:53,340 --> 03:57:55,750
It's great for making like
homemade documentaries too.

8422
03:57:55,760 --> 03:57:57,450
It's be like if you have a speech,

8423
03:57:57,510 --> 03:57:58,380
you got any speech,

8424
03:57:58,381 --> 03:58:02,550
you just want to just pour out all
your thoughts and blogs or whatever.

8425
03:58:02,700 --> 03:58:03,451
You can actually,

8426
03:58:03,451 --> 03:58:04,440
anything that you're saying.

8427
03:58:04,441 --> 03:58:06,420
You could punch it in Google
and just like have like a,

8428
03:58:06,720 --> 03:58:09,120
like a a low budget documentary.

8429
03:58:09,121 --> 03:58:10,170
Everybody's doing those.

8430
03:58:10,171 --> 03:58:11,820
You just collect all the
pictures of what you're saying.

8431
03:58:11,940 --> 03:58:16,140
You listen to someone speak or you or
whoever and just listen to it once and

8432
03:58:16,141 --> 03:58:16,651
write notes.

8433
03:58:16,651 --> 03:58:18,110
I need a picture of that
in a picture of that.

8434
03:58:18,120 --> 03:58:18,750
You haven't,

8435
03:58:18,750 --> 03:58:19,680
you get all those pictures,

8436
03:58:19,681 --> 03:58:20,221
line them up,

8437
03:58:20,221 --> 03:58:20,521
boom,

8438
03:58:20,521 --> 03:58:22,830
and you have a goddamn documentary.

8439
03:58:23,310 --> 03:58:23,790
Yeah,

8440
03:58:23,790 --> 03:58:26,130
and that's on Youtube and
then you change the world.

8441
03:58:26,310 --> 03:58:26,611
Yeah,

8442
03:58:26,611 --> 03:58:29,400
the fucker's let bitches know about rods.

8443
03:58:29,770 --> 03:58:31,410
You can do that shit
on your phone now too,

8444
03:58:31,411 --> 03:58:32,520
which is even more interesting.

8445
03:58:32,750 --> 03:58:34,490
The whole movie on video shop.

8446
03:58:34,540 --> 03:58:36,840
I'm a whole movie on your phone.

8447
03:58:37,290 --> 03:58:38,340
You could just make a movie.

8448
03:58:38,341 --> 03:58:41,790
You and your buddies here hold the
phone now and then and then you do your

8449
03:58:41,791 --> 03:58:42,330
scene.

8450
03:58:42,330 --> 03:58:43,350
Then he does his scene.

8451
03:58:43,540 --> 03:58:44,910
You edited it all together.

8452
03:58:44,960 --> 03:58:45,980
It's fairly does that a lot.

8453
03:58:45,981 --> 03:58:47,930
Is Carla Esparza that she,

8454
03:58:48,160 --> 03:58:49,400
she's always making these films.

8455
03:58:49,410 --> 03:58:50,660
Little tiny one minute.

8456
03:58:50,710 --> 03:58:51,260
Uh,

8457
03:58:51,260 --> 03:58:52,093
sketches.

8458
03:58:52,960 --> 03:58:53,793
Good for her.

8459
03:58:54,280 --> 03:58:55,090
Good for her.

8460
03:58:55,090 --> 03:58:56,470
She's very animated.

8461
03:58:56,680 --> 03:58:57,513
Nice.

8462
03:58:58,060 --> 03:58:58,893
Yeah.

8463
03:58:59,140 --> 03:59:00,610
Women's fucking strawweight division.

8464
03:59:00,611 --> 03:59:01,470
He ended up tonight.

8465
03:59:01,970 --> 03:59:02,250
Hell,

8466
03:59:02,250 --> 03:59:04,960
age van Zandt jumping
roundhouse kick to the face.

8467
03:59:05,320 --> 03:59:06,220
That was crazy.

8468
03:59:07,000 --> 03:59:07,271
Okay,

8469
03:59:07,271 --> 03:59:11,590
so who soon Joe Hannah is the champion
and then who else is right there?

8470
03:59:11,680 --> 03:59:12,820
Who's is there?

8471
03:59:12,821 --> 03:59:13,860
That Valentina Chick?

8472
03:59:13,900 --> 03:59:14,500
Yeah.

8473
03:59:14,500 --> 03:59:14,951

Shevchenko she's a and
also Valentina ship tank.

8475
03:59:18,900 --> 03:59:19,241
I'm sorry.

8476
03:59:19,241 --> 03:59:20,070
She's a Bantam weight.

8477
03:59:20,070 --> 03:59:21,180
One 30 thinking of a,

8478
03:59:21,200 --> 03:59:21,760

8479
03:59:21,760 --> 03:59:22,660
cause Valentino shift.

8480
03:59:22,661 --> 03:59:25,420
Chenko just beat Holly Holm.

8481
03:59:25,480 --> 03:59:26,380
Remember we go

8482
03:59:27,940 --> 03:59:28,773

Jessica Andraj she dropped down.

8486
03:59:33,730 --> 03:59:33,970
Okay.

8487
03:59:33,970 --> 03:59:35,260
Those are the top checks.

8488
03:59:35,620 --> 03:59:37,930
How come I don't recognize
any of those girls down?

8489
03:59:38,050 --> 03:59:38,441
I don't know.

8490
03:59:38,441 --> 03:59:39,190
Shit.

8491
03:59:39,190 --> 03:59:41,550
I know Joanne called
the Wood Cortney Casey

8492
03:59:43,660 --> 03:59:44,290
chambers.

8493
03:59:44,290 --> 03:59:44,591
Heather.

Joe Clark.

8495
03:59:45,071 --> 03:59:45,440
Okay.

8496
03:59:45,440 --> 03:59:46,600
These current rankings,

8497
03:59:46,900 --> 03:59:48,400
I can't because those top girls,

8498
03:59:48,401 --> 03:59:48,850
I didn't,

8499
03:59:48,850 --> 03:59:49,690
I've never heard of them,

8500
03:59:49,691 --> 03:59:51,820
but I've heard it all these Amanda Cooper.

8501
03:59:52,040 --> 03:59:52,600
I look at it.

8502
03:59:52,600 --> 03:59:52,901
Oh,

8503
03:59:52,901 --> 03:59:54,110
how dare you Jamie.

8504
03:59:54,550 --> 03:59:55,650
How dare you.

8505
03:59:56,150 --> 03:59:56,620
How right.

8506
03:59:56,620 --> 03:59:57,850
So it's a random listing.

8507
03:59:57,890 --> 03:59:58,240
Yeah,

8508
03:59:58,240 --> 03:59:59,110
it's just random.

8509
03:59:59,170 --> 03:59:59,751
I have a bet.

8510
03:59:59,751 --> 04:00:00,584
Um,

8511
04:00:00,640 --> 04:00:01,120
let's see.

8512
04:00:01,120 --> 04:00:02,020
They have rankings.

8513
04:00:02,160 --> 04:00:02,621
There we go.

8514
04:00:02,621 --> 04:00:03,280
Okay.

8515
04:00:03,280 --> 04:00:04,250
That's weird that they have it.

8516
04:00:04,330 --> 04:00:04,960
Okay,

8517
04:00:04,960 --> 04:00:05,793
here we go.

8518
04:00:05,890 --> 04:00:06,760
Women's strawweight.

8519
04:00:06,790 --> 04:00:07,623
What do we got here?

8520
04:00:07,780 --> 04:00:08,560
Blow that bitch shop.

8521
04:00:08,560 --> 04:00:09,393
What do we got here?

8522
04:00:09,550 --> 04:00:09,980
Oh yeah.

8523
04:00:09,980 --> 04:00:11,440
Rose [inaudible].

8524
04:00:11,880 --> 04:00:14,410
Carolina callous to else.

8525
04:00:14,411 --> 04:00:15,170
Kvetch.

8526
04:00:15,170 --> 04:00:15,550
Kvl.

8527
04:00:15,550 --> 04:00:17,530
Kovich I have to say that right.

8528
04:00:17,680 --> 04:00:18,610
I always fuck it up.

8529
04:00:18,930 --> 04:00:20,310
Carolina Kl Kovich

8530
04:00:20,400 --> 04:00:22,530
ages waiting 10 young shit.

8531
04:00:22,700 --> 04:00:24,660
Kovacevich is the one who just beat rose.

8532
04:00:25,560 --> 04:00:26,460
That was a great fight.

8533
04:00:26,520 --> 04:00:27,480
Rose just lost.

8534
04:00:27,510 --> 04:00:27,811
Yeah,

8535
04:00:27,811 --> 04:00:28,561
she just lost it.

8536
04:00:28,561 --> 04:00:29,231
Cave all cubit.

8537
04:00:29,231 --> 04:00:29,581
Damn,

8538
04:00:29,581 --> 04:00:30,414
I missed that one.

8539
04:00:30,480 --> 04:00:31,740
And this Teesha Torres.

8540
04:00:31,860 --> 04:00:32,970
She's bad ass.

8541
04:00:33,750 --> 04:00:34,590
So Carolina,

8542
04:00:34,591 --> 04:00:35,131
Pete rose.

8543
04:00:35,131 --> 04:00:35,964
How does she beat her?

8544
04:00:36,060 --> 04:00:37,110
Just a decision.

8545
04:00:37,770 --> 04:00:38,670
Really good fight.

8546
04:00:40,180 --> 04:00:41,660
Was that a five round fight vision?

8547
04:00:43,000 --> 04:00:43,630
Why do I say,

8548
04:00:43,630 --> 04:00:45,140
why don't I think that
was a five round fight.

8549
04:00:45,220 --> 04:00:46,510
You think Ron does coming back?

8550
04:00:46,840 --> 04:00:47,673
Fuck yeah.

8551
04:00:48,240 --> 04:00:49,190
Much money she make.

8552
04:00:50,680 --> 04:00:53,470
Do you know how big it will
be when Ronda comes back now?

8553
04:00:53,471 --> 04:00:56,230
It could just be Rhonda and
Cyborg right off the bat.

8554
04:00:56,380 --> 04:00:58,960
Right off the bat and that
would be the biggest fight ever.

8555
04:00:59,010 --> 04:00:59,831
Just even right now.

8556
04:00:59,831 --> 04:01:00,910
Even though she just lost.

8557
04:01:00,970 --> 04:01:01,990
Do you think she would do that?

8558
04:01:02,110 --> 04:01:02,980
What do you think she would do?

8559
04:01:03,040 --> 04:01:04,930
That would be the most
gangster move right there.

8560
04:01:04,931 --> 04:01:05,820
Who just say fuck it.

8561
04:01:05,830 --> 04:01:07,270
That that would be the ultimate gangster.

8562
04:01:07,300 --> 04:01:08,110
Rhonda just said,

8563
04:01:08,110 --> 04:01:10,050
I'm coming back and it's me and Cyborg.

8564
04:01:10,051 --> 04:01:14,260
We're gonna do one 40 let's fucking do
this shit for a super bowl fight of all

8565
04:01:14,261 --> 04:01:14,720
time.

8566
04:01:14,720 --> 04:01:15,553
Let's do it.

8567
04:01:15,610 --> 04:01:16,750
That would be the gangster shit.

8568
04:01:16,751 --> 04:01:21,130
There would be the gangster shit or
you got to get home home right now.

8569
04:01:21,131 --> 04:01:23,050
Homes like on a down swing.

8570
04:01:23,230 --> 04:01:26,170
It's a perfect time for
Rhonda to cause for sure.

8571
04:01:26,171 --> 04:01:27,140
Homing going to turn down.

8572
04:01:27,150 --> 04:01:27,983
Rhonda.

8573
04:01:28,090 --> 04:01:29,800
Rhonda is in control of that fight.

8574
04:01:29,920 --> 04:01:31,690
She can get redemption right off the bat.

8575
04:01:31,780 --> 04:01:32,740
Do you think she does that?

8576
04:01:32,741 --> 04:01:34,450
Are you think she goes
straight to a title shot?

8577
04:01:36,880 --> 04:01:40,890
All three cyborg would be the biggest
title shot would be big there.

8578
04:01:40,990 --> 04:01:41,690
I'll be big.

8579
04:01:41,690 --> 04:01:44,650
I think cyber would be the biggest and
people would understand that she's not

8580
04:01:44,651 --> 04:01:47,140
getting a title shot right
away to the Amanda Nunes.

8581
04:01:47,141 --> 04:01:47,561
Genesis.

8582
04:01:47,561 --> 04:01:48,910
God Damn terrified.

8583
04:01:49,330 --> 04:01:50,230
She's terrified.

8584
04:01:50,260 --> 04:01:51,730
But her against sidewalk will be bigger.

8585
04:01:52,570 --> 04:01:53,230
Yes.

8586
04:01:53,230 --> 04:01:57,430
Even even with that top percent
will be bigger than her and home.

8587
04:01:57,460 --> 04:01:59,770
Amanda Nunez is legit as fuck.

8588
04:01:59,800 --> 04:02:01,330
Obviously after she
beat me she would take,

8589
04:02:01,331 --> 04:02:04,270
but she's going to have to have some
more fights where people know about her

8590
04:02:04,271 --> 04:02:06,100
more to get the big money fights.

8591
04:02:06,101 --> 04:02:06,491
I think,

8592
04:02:06,491 --> 04:02:06,940
you know,

8593
04:02:06,940 --> 04:02:09,420
to get people like to get
a Rhonda to want a fighter.

8594
04:02:09,460 --> 04:02:09,950
Yeah.

8595
04:02:09,950 --> 04:02:14,950
Everybody wants to see the Cyborg fight
home and Rhonda would be fucking Mega.

8596
04:02:15,200 --> 04:02:16,600
You just base it all on the revenge.

8597
04:02:16,630 --> 04:02:18,940
But home did lose her last two fights.

8598
04:02:18,941 --> 04:02:19,691
So that kind of could,

8599
04:02:19,691 --> 04:02:20,260
doesn't matter.

8600
04:02:20,260 --> 04:02:20,680
Doesn't matter.

8601
04:02:20,680 --> 04:02:23,370
Busler Shirky roar Micky ward and um,

8602
04:02:24,220 --> 04:02:27,700
homeboy the fuck you to a
Turo Gotti like that trilogy.

8603
04:02:27,701 --> 04:02:28,241
Nobody cared.

8604
04:02:28,241 --> 04:02:29,230
They weren't the best in the world.

8605
04:02:29,260 --> 04:02:29,981
No one gave a fuck.

8606
04:02:29,981 --> 04:02:30,461
No one can see.

8607
04:02:30,461 --> 04:02:32,950
That's what I think about this
whole law and not that this isn't,

8608
04:02:33,280 --> 04:02:35,770
that is not one of the best in the
world because he definitely is.

8609
04:02:35,771 --> 04:02:36,604
And so it was Nate.

8610
04:02:36,880 --> 04:02:37,330
Um,

8611
04:02:37,330 --> 04:02:39,700
but like they fight for
the title at one 17.

8612
04:02:39,701 --> 04:02:40,300
They didn't matter.

8613
04:02:40,300 --> 04:02:40,750
Dana.

8614
04:02:40,750 --> 04:02:41,021
Yeah.

8615
04:02:41,021 --> 04:02:41,381
Dana,

8616
04:02:41,381 --> 04:02:44,080
thanks for some reason that that fight
doesn't make sense to do it again.

8617
04:02:44,081 --> 04:02:44,321
I'm like,

8618
04:02:44,321 --> 04:02:45,130
Oh my God,

8619
04:02:45,130 --> 04:02:45,963
are you crazy?

8620
04:02:46,270 --> 04:02:47,380
Like please do it again,

8621
04:02:47,620 --> 04:02:48,370
please.

8622
04:02:48,370 --> 04:02:50,590
Like if they want to do it or they
both saying they want to do it,

8623
04:02:50,800 --> 04:02:53,320
who the fuck doesn't want
to see that fight again?

8624
04:02:53,650 --> 04:02:56,980
And if he's got to give up
the featherweight fight or
the featherweight title to

8625
04:02:56,981 --> 04:02:57,820
have that fight again,

8626
04:02:58,090 --> 04:02:59,410
can you just give up the title?

8627
04:02:59,710 --> 04:03:00,640
Give up the title?

8628
04:03:01,090 --> 04:03:01,481
Yeah,

8629
04:03:01,481 --> 04:03:02,620
put that fight on again.

8630
04:03:02,710 --> 04:03:03,543
Definitely.

8631
04:03:03,580 --> 04:03:04,570
You don't want to see that again.

8632
04:03:04,630 --> 04:03:05,110
Yes.

8633
04:03:05,110 --> 04:03:09,340
But it'll happen regardless of Connor
wins or loses his upcoming matches.

8634
04:03:09,341 --> 04:03:10,510
It wouldn't even affect it.

8635
04:03:10,720 --> 04:03:11,141
Like if he,

8636
04:03:11,141 --> 04:03:12,160
if he decided to fight,

8637
04:03:12,410 --> 04:03:13,243
uh,

8638
04:03:13,910 --> 04:03:14,320
Matt,

8639
04:03:14,320 --> 04:03:15,041
it doesn't matter.

8640
04:03:15,041 --> 04:03:15,730
Even if it loses,

8641
04:03:15,730 --> 04:03:16,301
it doesn't matter.

8642
04:03:16,301 --> 04:03:17,134
That's tonight.

8643
04:03:18,200 --> 04:03:21,580
That third fight is always going to be
there because if you put Connor against

8644
04:03:21,910 --> 04:03:23,650
anybody at 55 right now,

8645
04:03:23,651 --> 04:03:25,030
haven't relinquished that title.

8646
04:03:25,210 --> 04:03:26,290
Give it back to Aldo.

8647
04:03:26,500 --> 04:03:28,050
Do 55 to anybody.

8648
04:03:28,090 --> 04:03:29,200
Do Magnum met off?

8649
04:03:29,260 --> 04:03:30,010
That would be huge.

8650
04:03:30,010 --> 04:03:31,420
Or Tony Ferguson would be huge.

8651
04:03:31,421 --> 04:03:32,650
That'd be a lot of press on that.

8652
04:03:32,920 --> 04:03:34,240
Tony Ferguson deserves that.

8653
04:03:34,600 --> 04:03:36,730
And then also you could just finish that.

8654
04:03:36,731 --> 04:03:38,620
Rafael dos Anjos let's make that happen.

8655
04:03:38,910 --> 04:03:39,740
Those are fine.

8656
04:03:39,740 --> 04:03:40,640
It's at 55.

8657
04:03:40,641 --> 04:03:41,540
It's already been stated.

8658
04:03:41,541 --> 04:03:42,860
This is going to fight for the title.

8659
04:03:42,980 --> 04:03:44,600
So he would go right to Alvarez.

8660
04:03:44,730 --> 04:03:45,890
He would fight Eddie Alvarez

8661
04:03:46,160 --> 04:03:46,993
be beautiful too.

8662
04:03:47,790 --> 04:03:48,450
Beautiful.

8663
04:03:48,450 --> 04:03:49,740
Holy Shit would be beautiful.

8664
04:03:49,741 --> 04:03:50,341
That would be crazy.

8665
04:03:50,341 --> 04:03:51,300
So many epic.

8666
04:03:51,301 --> 04:03:52,081
Matt did.

8667
04:03:52,081 --> 04:03:52,621
I'm telling you,

8668
04:03:52,621 --> 04:03:53,430
dude,

8669
04:03:53,430 --> 04:03:56,640
Connor's going to buy a
fucking island and shit.

8670
04:03:56,820 --> 04:03:57,040
Yeah,

8671
04:03:57,040 --> 04:03:59,850
probably couple islands
probably have a UFO.

8672
04:04:00,900 --> 04:04:01,231
He's like,

8673
04:04:01,231 --> 04:04:02,460
now he's going to have,

8674
04:04:02,670 --> 04:04:03,960
he's going to have a um,

8675
04:04:04,200 --> 04:04:04,670
uh,

8676
04:04:04,670 --> 04:04:05,020
what the,

8677
04:04:05,020 --> 04:04:06,360
what are those fucking hyenas?

8678
04:04:06,540 --> 04:04:07,111
Hyenas.

8679
04:04:07,111 --> 04:04:08,790
He's going to have rain
is instead of bowls.

8680
04:04:08,960 --> 04:04:09,750
Pet Wolverine.

8681
04:04:09,750 --> 04:04:13,200
Drive a tank instead of a fucking any car.

8682
04:04:13,320 --> 04:04:14,153
What do you see?

8683
04:04:14,190 --> 04:04:16,230
A corner and covered tank.

8684
04:04:16,350 --> 04:04:19,080
A tank in front of a castle with hyenas?

8685
04:04:19,930 --> 04:04:20,763
Yeah.

8686
04:04:20,980 --> 04:04:21,880
Gold bars

8687
04:04:22,110 --> 04:04:23,880
all around us better in the private jet,

8688
04:04:23,881 --> 04:04:24,870
like Trump's private jet,

8689
04:04:24,871 --> 04:04:27,600
which is like a seven
57 just like a whole,

8690
04:04:27,660 --> 04:04:28,800
not just the little jet.

8691
04:04:28,950 --> 04:04:31,290
A whole Goddamn jumbo jet for yourself.

8692
04:04:31,350 --> 04:04:32,560
Do you know how know
there's something wrong?

8693
04:04:32,690 --> 04:04:33,523
Trump.

8694
04:04:33,950 --> 04:04:35,480
Do you know how I know
something wrong with Trump?

8695
04:04:36,080 --> 04:04:38,940
Because he was eating Kentucky Fried
Chicken on his airplane with a fork and a

8696
04:04:38,941 --> 04:04:39,774
knife.

8697
04:04:40,100 --> 04:04:42,050
Was it okay when I tell him,

8698
04:04:42,051 --> 04:04:42,884
man,

8699
04:04:43,220 --> 04:04:44,053
that ain't good.

8700
04:04:44,120 --> 04:04:44,750
Tell me,

8701
04:04:44,750 --> 04:04:45,920
tell me what the fuck's going on there.

8702
04:04:46,250 --> 04:04:49,130
Can you hang with the dude who eat
Kentucky Fried Chicken when the fork and

8703
04:04:49,131 --> 04:04:50,330
knife look at what's going on here.

8704
04:04:50,540 --> 04:04:51,373
What's going on here?

8705
04:04:51,710 --> 04:04:52,940
He got his class maybe.

8706
04:04:53,090 --> 04:04:53,800
Is that what it is?

8707
04:04:53,800 --> 04:04:53,990
Yeah,

8708
04:04:53,990 --> 04:04:54,823
I'm a skunk.

8709
04:04:54,890 --> 04:04:55,370
I'm a scam.

8710
04:04:55,370 --> 04:04:57,530
How do you feel about fork and
knife conducted fried chicken.

8711
04:04:57,531 --> 04:05:00,350
I feel like it's dudes who wear
sneakers or don't have any socks on.

8712
04:05:00,650 --> 04:05:00,951
Listen,

8713
04:05:00,951 --> 04:05:03,950
you stinky bitch come back to America.

8714
04:05:04,340 --> 04:05:05,173
There's no proof.

8715
04:05:05,310 --> 04:05:08,370
It doesn't that seem like a
very product placement type.

8716
04:05:08,440 --> 04:05:10,400
Little human right?

8717
04:05:10,401 --> 04:05:11,234
It does.

8718
04:05:11,330 --> 04:05:13,070
Do you think he got paid by KFC?

8719
04:05:13,460 --> 04:05:15,530
How dare you all bucket to himself.

8720
04:05:16,090 --> 04:05:16,520
He might,

8721
04:05:16,520 --> 04:05:17,840
what happened on,

8722
04:05:17,900 --> 04:05:18,930
uh,

8723
04:05:18,950 --> 04:05:20,270
go off shit.

8724
04:05:20,390 --> 04:05:22,190
Was it David Letterman or,

8725
04:05:22,400 --> 04:05:22,791
I don't know.

8726
04:05:22,791 --> 04:05:26,570
He was on some talk show where they
were calling them out on bringing out

8727
04:05:26,571 --> 04:05:28,730
clothes from companies that he owned.

8728
04:05:28,731 --> 04:05:29,600
Like where did you,

8729
04:05:29,601 --> 04:05:32,540
you're talking about the China trade or
where'd you make this isn't shirt shirt

8730
04:05:32,800 --> 04:05:33,680
is a shirt company.

8731
04:05:33,681 --> 04:05:34,730
Didn't cause that talk.

8732
04:05:34,740 --> 04:05:37,280
Meyer show that Seth
Meyers busted them out.

8733
04:05:37,730 --> 04:05:40,730
It must have been old cause I'm thinking
it's David Letterman and that must have

8734
04:05:40,731 --> 04:05:42,290
been at least two years old or something.

8735
04:05:43,740 --> 04:05:44,573
I Dunno.

8736
04:05:44,600 --> 04:05:46,520
But it gets called out on the show.

8737
04:05:46,580 --> 04:05:49,940
He's bringing out clothing
the Donald Trump is owns.

8738
04:05:50,920 --> 04:05:51,101
Yeah.

8739
04:05:51,101 --> 04:05:54,100
Make America great again by hiring
Chinese people to make your shirt.

8740
04:05:56,140 --> 04:05:57,090
But you know what man,

8741
04:05:57,091 --> 04:05:57,270
ever,

8742
04:05:57,270 --> 04:05:59,250
he's saying whatever it
takes to have a friend.

8743
04:05:59,610 --> 04:06:02,820
I have a friend who has some
sort of a marketing business,

8744
04:06:03,040 --> 04:06:03,490
um,

8745
04:06:03,490 --> 04:06:06,150
where a or a manufacturing
business rather,

8746
04:06:06,300 --> 04:06:07,081
where they make,

8747
04:06:07,081 --> 04:06:07,490
uh,

8748
04:06:07,490 --> 04:06:08,070
uh,

8749
04:06:08,070 --> 04:06:08,903
clothes.

8750
04:06:09,150 --> 04:06:09,661
They make,

8751
04:06:09,661 --> 04:06:10,140
um,

8752
04:06:10,140 --> 04:06:11,250
like outdoor clothes,

8753
04:06:11,251 --> 04:06:13,740
like hiking and
mountaineering clothes and,

8754
04:06:13,741 --> 04:06:14,130
uh,

8755
04:06:14,130 --> 04:06:16,070
they say that they can't

8756
04:06:16,070 --> 04:06:21,070
find a sew house in America that is up
to the same standards as the Sohouse as

8757
04:06:22,911 --> 04:06:25,820
they find in China because
they do so much manufacturing.

8758
04:06:26,120 --> 04:06:26,511
They're like,

8759
04:06:26,511 --> 04:06:26,691
look,

8760
04:06:26,691 --> 04:06:28,280
we would like to do this in America,

8761
04:06:28,310 --> 04:06:31,970
but in order to have the very
best quality of clothing,

8762
04:06:31,971 --> 04:06:36,971
like you literally can't do what
he's doing in America right now.

8763
04:06:37,970 --> 04:06:39,350
That's pretty fucking weird.

8764
04:06:39,530 --> 04:06:42,230
Like that's one of the scariest things
that happened when they started shipping

8765
04:06:42,740 --> 04:06:44,240
manufacturing overseas.

8766
04:06:44,390 --> 04:06:48,170
It's like other places got
way more manufacturing jobs.

8767
04:06:48,171 --> 04:06:48,680
Right?

8768
04:06:48,680 --> 04:06:53,680
But they also were working for insanely
low wages and living in the factories.

8769
04:06:54,440 --> 04:06:55,030
You know,

8770
04:06:55,030 --> 04:06:58,130
like that's one of the weirder
things about buying products.

8771
04:06:58,220 --> 04:06:58,341
Like,

8772
04:06:58,341 --> 04:06:59,570
if you buy something from China,

8773
04:06:59,571 --> 04:07:00,680
like if you buy an iPhone,

8774
04:07:00,920 --> 04:07:05,300
we all know it in our dirty little heart
of hearts that there's nets all around

8775
04:07:05,301 --> 04:07:08,720
those buildings to keep those
people from jumping to their death.

8776
04:07:09,320 --> 04:07:12,230
And they live there and have
somebody actually like was arguing.

8777
04:07:12,231 --> 04:07:12,501
Well,

8778
04:07:12,501 --> 04:07:12,801
you know,

8779
04:07:12,801 --> 04:07:16,070
the statistic likelihood of
someone committing suicide,

8780
04:07:16,460 --> 04:07:16,790
uh,

8781
04:07:16,790 --> 04:07:20,780
at one of those factories is not that
different than the statistical likelihood

8782
04:07:20,781 --> 04:07:25,781
of people in the area committing suicide
and since they live and work in that

8783
04:07:26,511 --> 04:07:30,890
factory gives you a deceptive number of
how many people who work in the factory

8784
04:07:30,891 --> 04:07:32,510
committing suicide nuts.

8785
04:07:32,670 --> 04:07:32,921
Yeah.

8786
04:07:32,921 --> 04:07:33,590
So what's the problem?

8787
04:07:33,590 --> 04:07:34,011
I was like,

8788
04:07:34,011 --> 04:07:34,221
yeah,

8789
04:07:34,221 --> 04:07:37,280
but the problem is they're killing
themselves where they work.

8790
04:07:37,760 --> 04:07:40,070
How many people kill themselves
when they work like worldwide?

8791
04:07:40,220 --> 04:07:41,690
Like the numbers pretty fucking low.

8792
04:07:41,691 --> 04:07:45,350
That's why it's weird when people jump
to their death rather than go to work

8793
04:07:45,351 --> 04:07:46,100
again.

8794
04:07:46,100 --> 04:07:47,690
That's fucking weird,

8795
04:07:47,691 --> 04:07:48,110
man.

8796
04:07:48,110 --> 04:07:48,950
That's weird.

8797
04:07:49,620 --> 04:07:51,170
Or were they smoking
cigarettes when they jumped?

8798
04:07:51,590 --> 04:07:52,370
Yes.

8799
04:07:52,370 --> 04:07:56,690
Even weirder to work as slaves to buy
cigarettes to jumped to their death while

8800
04:07:56,691 --> 04:07:59,990
they're making iPhones and
people stare at them on by Agra.

8801
04:08:00,260 --> 04:08:00,591
Yeah,

8802
04:08:00,591 --> 04:08:03,590
they get Viagra and random boner pills.

8803
04:08:04,230 --> 04:08:07,280
Foxconn replaces 60,000
factory workers with robots.

8804
04:08:07,370 --> 04:08:08,203
Good News.

8805
04:08:08,870 --> 04:08:10,640
Not really for those people
that needed that money.

8806
04:08:11,120 --> 04:08:11,751
I don't know man.

8807
04:08:11,751 --> 04:08:12,321
That's the weird,

8808
04:08:12,321 --> 04:08:13,154
slippery argument.

8809
04:08:13,670 --> 04:08:15,690
I know these people that
had a factory down and uh,

8810
04:08:15,830 --> 04:08:16,970
somewhere in South America,

8811
04:08:17,340 --> 04:08:19,340
it makes some clothes
for this big company.

8812
04:08:19,670 --> 04:08:20,750
And they were talking about how,

8813
04:08:20,780 --> 04:08:21,350
uh,

8814
04:08:21,350 --> 04:08:22,540
how much money it saves him.

8815
04:08:22,541 --> 04:08:22,801
I go,

8816
04:08:22,801 --> 04:08:22,971
yeah,

8817
04:08:22,971 --> 04:08:26,300
but does it didn't feel weird that these
people are so poor and that they work

8818
04:08:26,301 --> 04:08:27,740
all day in the factory?

8819
04:08:27,810 --> 04:08:29,480
Like I'm not trying to
be mean or anything.

8820
04:08:29,690 --> 04:08:30,081
She's like,

8821
04:08:30,081 --> 04:08:31,250
well then they didn't have that.

8822
04:08:31,251 --> 04:08:32,300
They would starve to death.

8823
04:08:32,630 --> 04:08:32,991
And I was like,

8824
04:08:32,991 --> 04:08:33,111
well,

8825
04:08:33,111 --> 04:08:35,420
would they really like how'd they
get there in the first place?

8826
04:08:35,660 --> 04:08:36,650
Because this is the only option.

8827
04:08:36,651 --> 04:08:40,940
The only option is they have to work and
sane hours for shit money so that they

8828
04:08:40,941 --> 04:08:42,980
can make clothes so they
could barely get by.

8829
04:08:43,010 --> 04:08:44,120
Like that's the only option.

8830
04:08:44,480 --> 04:08:46,760
That sounds so close to slavery.

8831
04:08:47,190 --> 04:08:51,740
It sounds so close that it's just like
an economic slaves that freelance st

8832
04:08:51,741 --> 04:08:52,310
slavery.

8833
04:08:52,310 --> 04:08:52,571
Yeah.

8834
04:08:52,571 --> 04:08:53,890
It's like they found
that you don't have to,

8835
04:08:53,910 --> 04:08:55,700
a wild slavery evolved into,

8836
04:08:55,701 --> 04:08:57,230
you wouldn't have the fucking house them.

8837
04:08:57,590 --> 04:09:00,130
We just paid them so they don't
think their slaves and then let them,

8838
04:09:00,131 --> 04:09:02,720
how's themselves have barely
going to be at afford anything.

8839
04:09:02,721 --> 04:09:03,800
So they got to work all day.

8840
04:09:03,980 --> 04:09:04,730
Perfect.

8841
04:09:04,730 --> 04:09:05,630
Now we came up with,

8842
04:09:06,110 --> 04:09:07,400
for our fucking animals,

8843
04:09:07,460 --> 04:09:09,740
if they came up with basic
income here in America,

8844
04:09:09,820 --> 04:09:10,201
like if they,

8845
04:09:10,201 --> 04:09:12,380
they they instituted like a living wage,

8846
04:09:12,680 --> 04:09:12,861
you know,

8847
04:09:12,861 --> 04:09:13,471
like whatever the,

8848
04:09:13,471 --> 04:09:14,520
whatever it would be.

8849
04:09:14,850 --> 04:09:15,700
And then uh,

8850
04:09:15,750 --> 04:09:19,830
then we started not doing that and like
not doing that to other parts of the

8851
04:09:19,831 --> 04:09:20,280
world.

8852
04:09:20,280 --> 04:09:21,630
Like if America got to a point,

8853
04:09:21,631 --> 04:09:23,490
whatever the point is
like 25 bucks an hour,

8854
04:09:23,491 --> 04:09:24,211
20 bucks an hour,

8855
04:09:24,211 --> 04:09:25,050
whatever it needs to be,

8856
04:09:25,051 --> 04:09:27,220
where you can totally survive off a war.

8857
04:09:27,221 --> 04:09:29,760
You can't pay anybody less than
that because they can't survive.

8858
04:09:29,761 --> 04:09:32,670
Like it's been determined like this is
like a reasonable amount you could pay

8859
04:09:32,671 --> 04:09:33,510
someone with their time.

8860
04:09:33,960 --> 04:09:37,800
The difference between that money and
how much money you can spend in a third

8861
04:09:37,801 --> 04:09:38,634
world country,

8862
04:09:38,940 --> 04:09:41,070
hiring people to make your shit.

8863
04:09:41,310 --> 04:09:42,900
It's staggering.

8864
04:09:43,350 --> 04:09:46,200
The amount more money that
you make is staggering.

8865
04:09:47,790 --> 04:09:48,391
It's a,

8866
04:09:48,391 --> 04:09:49,050
it's,

8867
04:09:49,050 --> 04:09:50,820
it's just weird that we allow it.

8868
04:09:51,690 --> 04:09:53,040
It's weird that we think it's okay.

8869
04:09:53,041 --> 04:09:53,670
Like it's over there.

8870
04:09:53,670 --> 04:09:54,151
It's over there.

8871
04:09:54,151 --> 04:09:54,870
It's over there.

8872
04:09:54,870 --> 04:09:55,251
It's just like,

8873
04:09:55,251 --> 04:09:56,410
if it was like,

8874
04:09:57,230 --> 04:09:57,651
fuck it,

8875
04:09:57,651 --> 04:09:58,321
this is my company.

8876
04:09:58,321 --> 04:09:59,154
I don't give a shit.

8877
04:09:59,160 --> 04:09:59,321
Well,

8878
04:09:59,321 --> 04:10:00,154
it's where we have like

8879
04:10:00,190 --> 04:10:00,850
boundaries.

8880
04:10:00,850 --> 04:10:04,570
Like we're okay if it's across the
dirt or if it's across the water,

8881
04:10:04,690 --> 04:10:05,500
it's okay,

8882
04:10:05,500 --> 04:10:06,580
but if it's inside of us,

8883
04:10:06,640 --> 04:10:07,630
we would never allow it.

8884
04:10:07,810 --> 04:10:08,410
Right.

8885
04:10:08,410 --> 04:10:09,910
Like think of the United
States of America.

8886
04:10:09,911 --> 04:10:10,061
Right.

8887
04:10:10,061 --> 04:10:10,421
It was nice.

8888
04:10:10,421 --> 04:10:11,111
He's from America,

8889
04:10:11,111 --> 04:10:14,190
from New York to Los Angeles has big open,

8890
04:10:14,400 --> 04:10:15,880
there's a lot of crazy shit in there.

8891
04:10:16,150 --> 04:10:18,310
There's a lot of places where
there's no people living.

8892
04:10:18,850 --> 04:10:22,690
If somehow or another they establish some
sort of manufacturing in the middle of

8893
04:10:22,691 --> 04:10:26,890
the country out there and paid people a
dollar a day and had them working like

8894
04:10:26,891 --> 04:10:29,710
slaves and living in these
buildings and jumping off the roof,

8895
04:10:29,920 --> 04:10:33,880
we would never tolerate it because
it's inside of our dirt patch.

8896
04:10:34,240 --> 04:10:37,060
But if it goes across the
water to the other dirt patch,

8897
04:10:37,070 --> 04:10:38,200
like outrageous.

8898
04:10:38,380 --> 04:10:43,380
Meanwhile for sure with us buying these
things were directly responsible for

8899
04:10:43,931 --> 04:10:46,270
them being able to have such
a factory in the first place.

8900
04:10:46,271 --> 04:10:46,991
And everybody's like,

8901
04:10:46,991 --> 04:10:47,111
well,

8902
04:10:47,111 --> 04:10:49,210
everybody else is doing it
and we just keep doing it.

8903
04:10:50,370 --> 04:10:51,330
Factories learned,

8904
04:10:51,331 --> 04:10:51,600
uh,

8905
04:10:51,600 --> 04:10:52,530
how to use the Internet,

8906
04:10:52,531 --> 04:10:52,771
man.

8907
04:10:52,771 --> 04:10:53,251
They're fucking,

8908
04:10:53,251 --> 04:10:57,710
they bombard everybody in the Jiu Jitsu
world about geese and rash guards and

8909
04:10:57,810 --> 04:10:59,190
special call man,

8910
04:10:59,191 --> 04:11:01,110
I get these emails every day,

8911
04:11:01,111 --> 04:11:04,320
multiple ones all over China,

8912
04:11:04,380 --> 04:11:05,220
Pakistan,

8913
04:11:05,221 --> 04:11:06,000
everywhere.

8914
04:11:06,000 --> 04:11:06,750
They're trying to,

8915
04:11:06,750 --> 04:11:08,370
they're going to come
and after people now,

8916
04:11:08,670 --> 04:11:09,510
it used to be that,

8917
04:11:09,980 --> 04:11:10,200
uh,

8918
04:11:10,200 --> 04:11:13,440
only certain people had connections
and he had to go there and find the

8919
04:11:13,441 --> 04:11:16,500
connections and your crazy stories
about these guys in Jujitsu,

8920
04:11:16,501 --> 04:11:18,210
like Scotty Nelson from Otm.

8921
04:11:18,450 --> 04:11:18,690
Lynn,

8922
04:11:18,690 --> 04:11:23,690
you had to go to China deep in China
findings factories and make these deals.

8923
04:11:23,910 --> 04:11:24,410
And Scott,

8924
04:11:24,410 --> 04:11:24,870
he's,

8925
04:11:24,870 --> 04:11:25,021
yeah,

8926
04:11:25,021 --> 04:11:26,490
he's got some nightmare stories.

8927
04:11:26,491 --> 04:11:27,000
Dude.

8928
04:11:27,000 --> 04:11:31,800
And Pakistan can imagine crazy
shit taking is going to die.

8929
04:11:32,040 --> 04:11:33,630
I believe that he's got some stories.

8930
04:11:33,840 --> 04:11:35,730
He told them my podcast
and we're fucking nuts.

8931
04:11:36,360 --> 04:11:36,931
I believe it,

8932
04:11:36,931 --> 04:11:37,680
man.

8933
04:11:37,680 --> 04:11:38,513
I believe it.

8934
04:11:38,550 --> 04:11:39,383
Fuck that.

8935
04:11:39,420 --> 04:11:39,661
Yeah,

8936
04:11:39,661 --> 04:11:39,921
there's,

8937
04:11:39,921 --> 04:11:41,910
there's parts of the world
that you're just not safe.

8938
04:11:41,911 --> 04:11:45,060
And that's why when people come
from those parts and they come back,

8939
04:11:45,061 --> 04:11:45,450
they go,

8940
04:11:45,450 --> 04:11:46,283
dude,

8941
04:11:46,640 --> 04:11:48,870
like we've got to keep this going.

8942
04:11:49,440 --> 04:11:51,630
Whatever we got going on here
and we've got to keep this going.

8943
04:11:51,631 --> 04:11:54,220
We can't let this thing or a road like,

8944
04:11:54,300 --> 04:11:55,410
it's not perfect.

8945
04:11:55,710 --> 04:11:57,090
The United States isn't perfect,

8946
04:11:57,720 --> 04:12:01,650
but the whole world is in a
fucking turmoil right now.

8947
04:12:01,830 --> 04:12:02,970
It's a sustainable,

8948
04:12:02,971 --> 04:12:05,280
currently sort of sustainable turmoil,

8949
04:12:05,610 --> 04:12:06,780
but it's in a turmoil,

8950
04:12:07,080 --> 04:12:07,913
you know?

8951
04:12:08,160 --> 04:12:08,760
I mean,

8952
04:12:08,760 --> 04:12:11,130
this is a weird time to be a person.

8953
04:12:11,140 --> 04:12:12,520
I think everybody realizes

8954
04:12:12,530 --> 04:12:17,530
we're in some strange transitionary stage
of being a human being or human beings

8955
04:12:18,521 --> 04:12:23,230
are aware of like infinitely more now
than they were just a few decades ago.

8956
04:12:23,530 --> 04:12:28,530
And we're evaluating everything about
everything and putting it through this

8957
04:12:28,811 --> 04:12:30,520
filter and trying to
figure it out and going,

8958
04:12:30,521 --> 04:12:31,354
whoa,

8959
04:12:31,450 --> 04:12:35,140
what kind of weird life where we
live in this temporary existence,

8960
04:12:35,620 --> 04:12:40,270
trying to sort out this
impossibly complicated,

8961
04:12:40,271 --> 04:12:44,590
fucked up world of political connections.

8962
04:12:45,220 --> 04:12:50,220
And one hand washing the other and the
Clinton Foundation and all this word.

8963
04:12:51,451 --> 04:12:52,330
I'm gonna fucking,

8964
04:12:52,390 --> 04:12:53,223
Oh dude,

8965
04:12:53,280 --> 04:12:54,071
he says Gotham.

8966
04:12:54,071 --> 04:12:55,150
I don't know if it's true,

8967
04:12:55,240 --> 04:12:56,073
but I'd love,

8968
04:12:56,080 --> 04:12:57,580
I'd love some conspiracy theories.

8969
04:12:57,581 --> 04:13:01,420
And one of them that I've been dabbling
in is all these people that crossed

8970
04:13:01,421 --> 04:13:01,781
Hillary,

8971
04:13:01,781 --> 04:13:02,830
that turned up dead

8972
04:13:03,880 --> 04:13:05,380
to business as usual.

8973
04:13:06,430 --> 04:13:07,850
Same Shit that's not so many,

8974
04:13:07,860 --> 04:13:08,480
so many

8975
04:13:08,480 --> 04:13:09,950
meme that uh,

8976
04:13:09,951 --> 04:13:14,510
you are statistically less likely to
get bit by a shark than you are to get

8977
04:13:14,511 --> 04:13:14,910
killed by [inaudible]

8978
04:13:14,910 --> 04:13:15,743
Hillary.

8979
04:13:17,010 --> 04:13:17,843
She's a gangster.

8980
04:13:17,940 --> 04:13:18,860
Her and her husband,

8981
04:13:18,900 --> 04:13:20,340
those guys are fucking ghost.

8982
04:13:21,520 --> 04:13:22,353
Well,

8983
04:13:22,690 --> 04:13:24,140
do you think that they got done?

8984
04:13:24,160 --> 04:13:26,950
I would love to thank the doctor
drew was on the way out anyway,

8985
04:13:28,450 --> 04:13:29,200
and then,

8986
04:13:29,200 --> 04:13:29,560
you know,

8987
04:13:29,560 --> 04:13:32,560
he got fired just coincidentally
after he said that about Hillary.

8988
04:13:32,610 --> 04:13:33,121
I think,

8989
04:13:33,121 --> 04:13:33,630
uh,

8990
04:13:33,630 --> 04:13:34,650
I would like to thank that.

8991
04:13:34,680 --> 04:13:37,800
I think the corruption in politics,

8992
04:13:38,090 --> 04:13:38,390
uh,

8993
04:13:38,390 --> 04:13:40,140
borrows a lot from the mafia.

8994
04:13:40,141 --> 04:13:42,540
They work hand in hand most
of the time and they bought,

8995
04:13:42,541 --> 04:13:44,730
they like to make statements cause
there's show when you look into it,

8996
04:13:44,731 --> 04:13:46,290
he said people that are
dying around Hillary,

8997
04:13:46,620 --> 04:13:46,981
dude,

8998
04:13:46,981 --> 04:13:48,480
there's people that are dying around,

8999
04:13:48,680 --> 04:13:48,960
uh,

9000
04:13:48,960 --> 04:13:52,530
Bill and Hillary from back
in the day they get suicided.

9001
04:13:52,620 --> 04:13:55,290
If you got suicided of some
guy who was about to do,

9002
04:13:55,530 --> 04:13:57,450
he was about to testify
and then he gets suicide.

9003
04:13:57,451 --> 04:13:58,740
But it's obvious it's not suicide.

9004
04:13:58,741 --> 04:13:59,574
It's like he got,

9005
04:13:59,670 --> 04:14:01,110
he got shot in the back of his head.

9006
04:14:01,370 --> 04:14:01,870
It's,

9007
04:14:01,870 --> 04:14:02,970
it's a message.

9008
04:14:03,030 --> 04:14:03,541
It's a mess.

9009
04:14:03,541 --> 04:14:04,470
Just like the Mafia.

9010
04:14:04,740 --> 04:14:06,870
They are not going to just kill
someone and make someone disappear.

9011
04:14:06,871 --> 04:14:07,860
That's a waste.

9012
04:14:08,040 --> 04:14:09,240
Why make them disappear?

9013
04:14:09,390 --> 04:14:10,410
Put them out or open,

9014
04:14:10,411 --> 04:14:11,250
cut out his tongue,

9015
04:14:11,340 --> 04:14:11,731
stuff,

9016
04:14:11,731 --> 04:14:13,950
his dick down his throat make,

9017
04:14:13,960 --> 04:14:17,520
give a message so that
messages shut the fuck up.

9018
04:14:17,550 --> 04:14:18,060
We got to,

9019
04:14:18,060 --> 04:14:20,350
we obviously got the corner in our pocket,

9020
04:14:20,351 --> 04:14:21,210
so shut the fuck up.

9021
04:14:21,420 --> 04:14:22,253
They're all,

9022
04:14:22,280 --> 04:14:22,710
it's,

9023
04:14:22,710 --> 04:14:24,030
those kinds of murders are everywhere.

9024
04:14:24,031 --> 04:14:24,540
They're sewers.

9025
04:14:24,540 --> 04:14:26,160
They generally suicides.

9026
04:14:26,700 --> 04:14:28,650
That guy that got convicted a supreme,

9027
04:14:28,830 --> 04:14:29,470
who is that guy?

9028
04:14:29,470 --> 04:14:32,580
Hacer the got convicted
of child molestation.

9029
04:14:32,581 --> 04:14:33,930
The only gave them 15 months.

9030
04:14:35,860 --> 04:14:37,900
She was defending Dennis Hastert.

9031
04:14:38,800 --> 04:14:39,161
He,

9032
04:14:39,161 --> 04:14:39,940
uh,

9033
04:14:39,940 --> 04:14:40,780
he's um,

9034
04:14:41,100 --> 04:14:42,040
I want to say

9035
04:14:43,450 --> 04:14:43,740
okay.

9036
04:14:43,740 --> 04:14:43,891
Oh,

9037
04:14:43,891 --> 04:14:45,540
he's with some serious judge.

9038
04:14:46,110 --> 04:14:48,480
The got convicted of child molestation,

9039
04:14:48,481 --> 04:14:49,530
pedophilia,

9040
04:14:49,560 --> 04:14:50,700
child pornography.

9041
04:14:51,440 --> 04:14:52,470
He's a house speaker.

9042
04:14:54,330 --> 04:14:55,800
This is a crazy story.

9043
04:14:56,100 --> 04:14:59,700
I just tweeted a study about it that uh,

9044
04:15:00,090 --> 04:15:02,150
they were doing an investigation of it.

9045
04:15:03,660 --> 04:15:04,890
Really scary stuff.

9046
04:15:06,500 --> 04:15:07,333
First paragraph.

9047
04:15:08,390 --> 04:15:08,990
Yeah.

9048
04:15:08,990 --> 04:15:10,100
Enormous amount of

9049
04:15:10,100 --> 04:15:11,790
tragedy surrounding revelations.

9050
04:15:11,791 --> 04:15:13,040
That former house speaker,

9051
04:15:13,700 --> 04:15:18,700
jade Dennis Hassard sexually abused a
number of young men whom he coached during

9052
04:15:19,071 --> 04:15:21,320
his time as a high school
teacher and wrestling instructor.

9053
04:15:21,321 --> 04:15:25,270
But there's also an enormous amount of
hypocrisy as the public words of a Po.

9054
04:15:25,320 --> 04:15:25,641
Okay.

9055
04:15:25,641 --> 04:15:25,941
This is,

9056
04:15:25,941 --> 04:15:26,061
so,

9057
04:15:26,061 --> 04:15:30,140
this is him talking shit about
Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky,

9058
04:15:30,710 --> 04:15:31,161
but he,

9059
04:15:31,161 --> 04:15:35,090
the thing is that he only
went to jail for 15 months.

9060
04:15:35,810 --> 04:15:36,441
Like he,

9061
04:15:36,441 --> 04:15:36,950
uh,

9062
04:15:36,950 --> 04:15:38,150
he got an ax,

9063
04:15:38,450 --> 04:15:41,390
extraordinarily low sentence,

9064
04:15:42,290 --> 04:15:43,340
short sentence.

9065
04:15:43,820 --> 04:15:44,720
They give back.

9066
04:15:44,750 --> 04:15:46,580
We've just tried to
find what the sentences,

9067
04:15:46,910 --> 04:15:47,930
because there was a,

9068
04:15:48,380 --> 04:15:51,680
there's a bunch of criticism about
it and there's a bunch of 'em really

9069
04:15:51,681 --> 04:15:53,120
revealing aspects to it.

9070
04:15:53,330 --> 04:15:54,163
I don't know.

9071
04:15:55,580 --> 04:15:56,413
It's scary.

9072
04:15:57,380 --> 04:16:00,710
It's scary to think that someone could
do that and only get 15 months because of

9073
04:16:00,711 --> 04:16:01,850
political connections.

9074
04:16:02,960 --> 04:16:03,700
But it makes sense.

9075
04:16:03,700 --> 04:16:04,533
Right?

9076
04:16:05,280 --> 04:16:05,730
Uh,

9077
04:16:05,730 --> 04:16:07,210
when I was looking up something,

9078
04:16:08,040 --> 04:16:08,873
uh,

9079
04:16:09,500 --> 04:16:10,790
I forget the exact name right now,

9080
04:16:10,791 --> 04:16:12,500
when I was looking through
these a couple of weeks ago,

9081
04:16:12,501 --> 04:16:15,680
that the deaths and some of the people
that were killed and some of the weird

9082
04:16:15,681 --> 04:16:16,700
things that were going on,

9083
04:16:16,760 --> 04:16:17,593
uh,

9084
04:16:17,720 --> 04:16:18,980
I'll try to find the guy's name,

9085
04:16:18,981 --> 04:16:20,140
but he was one of the,

9086
04:16:20,141 --> 04:16:20,900
uh,

9087
04:16:20,900 --> 04:16:25,880
pardons from Clinton before he got out
of the office and he was indicted by

9088
04:16:25,881 --> 04:16:30,440
Giuliani for what was going to
be the biggest us tax evasion.

9089
04:16:31,110 --> 04:16:34,300
And the history is something like
60 [inaudible] not showing 60,

9090
04:16:34,310 --> 04:16:35,240
$60 million.

9091
04:16:35,241 --> 04:16:36,074
He's a billionaire.

9092
04:16:36,380 --> 04:16:40,010
And he basically bought his
way out of his conviction.

9093
04:16:40,550 --> 04:16:40,870
He had,

9094
04:16:40,870 --> 04:16:41,703
he had been,

9095
04:16:42,020 --> 04:16:44,180
I think he even was
turned up dead after that.

9096
04:16:44,181 --> 04:16:45,110
He wasn't dead at all.

9097
04:16:45,111 --> 04:16:48,020
This guy just bought his way
out of getting going to jail.

9098
04:16:48,940 --> 04:16:49,773
Okay,

9099
04:16:51,100 --> 04:16:52,580
you give money to this and that and then

9100
04:16:53,430 --> 04:16:54,270
you can do that.

9101
04:16:55,020 --> 04:16:57,120
No the right people and you
got the right kind of cash.

9102
04:16:57,610 --> 04:17:00,360
You can't do it if you're Bob Wilson,

9103
04:17:00,361 --> 04:17:01,320
camera repairman,

9104
04:17:01,890 --> 04:17:04,070
you know you don't have the kind
of cash to pay these fucking

9105
04:17:04,130 --> 04:17:04,671
people off.

9106
04:17:04,671 --> 04:17:05,780
Mark Rich was his name.

9107
04:17:06,960 --> 04:17:07,201
Yeah.

9108
04:17:07,201 --> 04:17:08,220
If you got cash you could,

9109
04:17:08,270 --> 04:17:09,103
if you have,

9110
04:17:09,320 --> 04:17:11,820
if there's enough money
and power behind it,

9111
04:17:11,821 --> 04:17:13,440
you can get the people
to believe anything.

9112
04:17:13,441 --> 04:17:18,270
As long as you can get it on commercials
and like a on the news media,

9113
04:17:18,271 --> 04:17:21,930
you can get people to believe
the most ridiculous shit.

9114
04:17:22,140 --> 04:17:26,940
You get people to believe the big
Dick Pills or like actually work.

9115
04:17:26,941 --> 04:17:30,960
If you've got big pharma to market it and
not like those late night commercials.

9116
04:17:31,060 --> 04:17:32,610
How do they do those
late night commercials?

9117
04:17:32,611 --> 04:17:33,540
How do they get away with that?

9118
04:17:34,890 --> 04:17:35,990
Laws don't count at nine.

9119
04:17:36,150 --> 04:17:36,910
Can you imagine?

9120
04:17:36,910 --> 04:17:39,300
Imagine a big Pharma
decided to take these big,

9121
04:17:39,301 --> 04:17:39,900
big pills.

9122
04:17:39,900 --> 04:17:44,070
Pay Off a couple of professors in Yale
like they been doing and Harvard and just

9123
04:17:44,071 --> 04:17:44,460
say,

9124
04:17:44,460 --> 04:17:45,060
shit,

9125
04:17:45,060 --> 04:17:45,893
this really,

9126
04:17:45,900 --> 04:17:47,190
and then present it as a problem.

9127
04:17:47,191 --> 04:17:50,310
Or are you a victim of short
Dixon drum or something like that.

9128
04:17:50,490 --> 04:17:50,941
You know what I mean?

9129
04:17:50,941 --> 04:17:51,511
But call it,

9130
04:17:51,511 --> 04:17:52,590
call it something,

9131
04:17:52,860 --> 04:17:57,660
call it something and can you imagine
you get your pay off to do one dude,

9132
04:17:57,690 --> 04:17:58,680
one dude from Yale,

9133
04:17:58,740 --> 04:17:58,990
he,

9134
04:17:58,990 --> 04:17:59,370
you,

9135
04:17:59,370 --> 04:18:01,260
you have them on an the infomercial.

9136
04:18:01,410 --> 04:18:02,430
It's totally big.

9137
04:18:02,431 --> 04:18:03,264
Farm it out.

9138
04:18:03,420 --> 04:18:07,980
After a while you'd be considered a not

9139
04:18:08,100 --> 04:18:11,340
if you believe that
shit didn't work right.

9140
04:18:11,820 --> 04:18:12,653
You understand?

9141
04:18:12,900 --> 04:18:15,360
It's totally all you need is a
couple of Harvard scientist to say,

9142
04:18:15,600 --> 04:18:15,811
Oh,

9143
04:18:15,811 --> 04:18:16,410
you're going to,

9144
04:18:16,410 --> 04:18:19,290
you're going to gain the 20
to 30% in the first month.

9145
04:18:19,440 --> 04:18:20,760
Everybody would jump on that.

9146
04:18:20,761 --> 04:18:21,840
It's so easy.

9147
04:18:22,080 --> 04:18:23,640
You put it on fucking CNN news,

9148
04:18:23,700 --> 04:18:24,533
