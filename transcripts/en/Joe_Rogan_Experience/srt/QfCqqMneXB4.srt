1
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:07,250
It's the general good experience
no matter what you call it.

2
00:00:07,251 --> 00:00:08,084
I was like,

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:13,630
that's going on right now to be in Venice
for anywhere or in Hollywood for just

4
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:15,291
even just standing up there.

5
00:00:15,291 --> 00:00:15,980
I'm on the right.

6
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:16,581
Look around here.

7
00:00:16,581 --> 00:00:16,941
You know what?

8
00:00:16,941 --> 00:00:18,590
I have coyote problems out here.

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,370
Occasionally there's a mountain lion
spotting a lot of hawks brown going to be

10
00:00:23,371 --> 00:00:24,110
where?

11
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:25,070
Deer everywhere.

12
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:25,461
This is,

13
00:00:25,461 --> 00:00:26,390
I like it out here man.

14
00:00:26,391 --> 00:00:29,840
This is quiet and this is not
quite enough for me because I want,

15
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,310
I want to live in the fucking woods.

16
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:36,490
I have a very distinct idea of the
difference between my private life and my

17
00:00:39,441 --> 00:00:40,910
personal life or my,

18
00:00:40,911 --> 00:00:41,031
uh,

19
00:00:41,031 --> 00:00:42,620
my public life and my public life.

20
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:44,300
I love working for the UFC.

21
00:00:44,301 --> 00:00:45,530
I loved doing standup comedy,

22
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:49,280
but both of those things involve large
numbers of people and constantly being

23
00:00:49,281 --> 00:00:53,930
around large numbers of fucking inverse
thousand people in this audience at the

24
00:00:53,931 --> 00:00:55,270
UFC and you know,

25
00:00:55,271 --> 00:00:58,010
and all these fucking people that you
see at comedy shows and all these people

26
00:00:58,011 --> 00:00:58,844
in Vegas.

27
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,660
I like.

28
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,320
How do you take pictures after shows?

29
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:02,120
Short man,

30
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:02,690
all the time.

31
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:03,710
I just go out.

32
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:04,850
When I do a comedy show,

33
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:05,330
I uh,

34
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:09,050
we wait about five or 10 minutes to
cool off and I'd go out and I think I'll

35
00:01:09,051 --> 00:01:09,884
stay for hours.

36
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:10,600
Pictures.

37
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,140
Yeah,

38
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:11,973
but,

39
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:13,160
but to go from that,

40
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:16,880
you want like a quiet
man living by the ocean,

41
00:01:16,881 --> 00:01:17,571
living by the lake,

42
00:01:17,571 --> 00:01:20,450
living more [inaudible]
people just can fucking chill.

43
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:21,381
You know,

44
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:22,490
we've talked about this before.

45
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:24,490
You don't have to live in populations,

46
00:01:24,491 --> 00:01:25,670
sentence centers anymore,

47
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:26,121
you know,

48
00:01:26,121 --> 00:01:31,121
not big major ones like La [inaudible]
comic if you want to do films was the

49
00:01:31,851 --> 00:01:33,560
last time you filmed
the film in Hollywood.

50
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:35,190
I know you'll do a TV show me.

51
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:36,950
Yeah,

52
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:37,200
yeah,

53
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:37,700
yeah,

54
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:38,090
yeah.

55
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:39,110
And then you can Skype those.

56
00:01:39,111 --> 00:01:41,990
Now people are skyping
in to Skype with David O.

57
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:42,110
Russell.

58
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:42,943
I got caught.

59
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,220
It's moving.

60
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,760
I didn't you because a,

61
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:49,170
I went to do standup and I put myself
on tape and said big mistake because

62
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:51,561
I can't talk about it.

63
00:01:51,561 --> 00:01:52,394
Come on fucker.

64
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:53,293
Can't talk about it.

65
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,620
Two Oh folks,

66
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,040
I found out one of his coconut juice
is better than regular coconut water.

67
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:58,460
Why?

68
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:01,670
The reason is because it
comes from Thailand and they
have their own plantation

69
00:02:01,671 --> 00:02:02,640
in Thailand because,

70
00:02:02,641 --> 00:02:03,050
um,

71
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:03,890
we've tried water.

72
00:02:03,891 --> 00:02:04,980
That's just pure coconut water.

73
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:05,781
Pure calls are going to want it.

74
00:02:05,781 --> 00:02:07,050
They just crack open the Cogan airport.

75
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:08,430
No,

76
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:08,630
no,

77
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:08,870
no,

78
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:09,350
not at all.

79
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:09,850
No.

80
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:14,850
Unsweet and it's fucking with the
wishes and preservative free and um,

81
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,250
uh,

82
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,530
it tastes way better than some
of the stuff that's similar.

83
00:02:18,531 --> 00:02:19,311
It looks the same.

84
00:02:19,311 --> 00:02:20,390
It's in the same kind of can,

85
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,040
but if he's like fucking bath water.

86
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,180
And so I emailed the people at c two.

87
00:02:24,181 --> 00:02:24,501
I was like,

88
00:02:24,501 --> 00:02:26,450
why is your stuff say tastes
so much better and sweeter?

89
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,120
It's from Thailand Tacos to his death.

90
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:30,710
Better Taco.

91
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:31,940
So there you go.

92
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,920
That you're interested in some delicious.

93
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:34,491
That's better.

94
00:02:34,491 --> 00:02:35,171
Girl Trisha,

95
00:02:35,171 --> 00:02:36,560
she's had a coconut juice.

96
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,010
Then get some c two O if you're
interested in Bryan County,

97
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,240
follow him on Twitter.

98
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,820
It's B.

99
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:43,820
R.

100
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:43,820
Y.

101
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:43,820
A.

102
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:43,820
N.

103
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:43,910
Callan.

104
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,340
C.

105
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:45,340
A.

106
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:45,340
L.

107
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:45,340
L.

108
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:45,340
E.

109
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:45,340
N.

110
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:45,350
Z.

111
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:47,750
I don't know where I got that
fucking don't worry about it.

112
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:48,620
And the genetic.

113
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,720
Do you even do work out?

114
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:50,870
That's my Irish Italian.

115
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:51,650
She crazy,

116
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:52,190
crazy.

117
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,210
My dance or jeans.

118
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,660
What's your favorite dance move?

119
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:56,031
I mean,

120
00:02:56,031 --> 00:02:57,140
I got so many,

121
00:02:57,141 --> 00:02:58,670
but probably just the push away.

122
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,280
Just the hush here.

123
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:02,290
What does that mean to
you when you do that?

124
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:06,270
I'm just pushing away negative energy
and then I'm bringing in positive energy

125
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:06,581
here.

126
00:03:06,581 --> 00:03:07,000
So it's,

127
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,020
it's this move.

128
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:09,640
So don't try this at home
because it takes life.

129
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:09,840
See,

130
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,040
I,

131
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,310
I rock back like that
and now we're taking in.

132
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:13,080
So,

133
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,300
uh,

134
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,850
I sent myself through college
doing some private dancing.

135
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,051
It makes me nuts.

136
00:03:17,051 --> 00:03:19,210
When people say that some of
themselves who call it playing pool,

137
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:20,880
it's going on the fuck you did.

138
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:25,960
This was bubbling up a
little bit right now.

139
00:03:25,961 --> 00:03:26,310
When your,

140
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,930
your legs or arms that never mind.

141
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,021
That's a pretty bad.

142
00:03:29,021 --> 00:03:29,810
This one must be,

143
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:30,250
I'll get some,

144
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,050
ain't gonna want to eat some ink.

145
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:34,930
Are you confident off still at the point
where I was from out of town is drawing

146
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:35,773
anybody.

147
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:36,693
I don't know what I want.

148
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,730
I get tired of it.

149
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:42,550
I'm like,

150
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,110
why do you think Gregor's
didn't look so great?

151
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:45,040
That's what Joe wrote.

152
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:45,281
I mean,

153
00:03:45,281 --> 00:03:45,700
uh,

154
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,361
that's what I dot.

155
00:03:46,361 --> 00:03:46,901
David off I go,

156
00:03:46,901 --> 00:03:47,970
what do you all attentive as he was?

157
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,270
Because I don't want
to look like an agent.

158
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,690
And they went online and I was like,

159
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:51,723
he's silly.

160
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:52,160
Brian.

161
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,820
Count silly to that's right.

162
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:54,880
Silly in a good way to tell.

163
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:55,714
I make my living.

164
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,140
We're going to eventually get dry.

165
00:03:57,141 --> 00:03:58,960
Brian count do his own fucking podcast.

166
00:03:59,110 --> 00:03:59,943
I'm doing low it up.

167
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:02,530
He swears to God like all
these other things here.

168
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:06,960
I do a lot of Jujitsu and I'm
fucking punch in boxing lore.

169
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,260
He's got it all folks been shaken.

170
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:14,340
I turned my at my startup death
valley fighting downstairs on MTV.

171
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,600
What's it like working for MTV?

172
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,450
Ah,

173
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:17,070
money.

174
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:17,903
A lot of money.

175
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:20,710
They just,

176
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:22,150
they with a wheelbarrow.

177
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:23,350
You get a 0.8.

178
00:04:23,351 --> 00:04:24,250
You're not making any money.

179
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:24,950
I did.

180
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:25,180
I,

181
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:25,870
I did.

182
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:26,350
Um,

183
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:30,580
I was just recurring because I didn't
want to sign up a contract cause otherwise

184
00:04:30,581 --> 00:04:31,360
they own you,

185
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,980
they own you and they won't
let you do other feminists.

186
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,210
So I make,

187
00:04:34,211 --> 00:04:35,170
I think I can buy,

188
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:35,920
I can not,

189
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,930
I can go out to dinner
twice and buy a VCR.

190
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:39,701
Where's the,

191
00:04:39,701 --> 00:04:40,150
uh,

192
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:45,040
is there anybody that's become famous
from MTV and the most read people but as

193
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,110
Jersey shore MTV who was,

194
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:48,371
wow,

195
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:48,670
I didn't,

196
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:50,740
why don't think it was like
Bravo or 16 and pregnant.

197
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:51,963
Huge.

198
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:52,960
Yeah,

199
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,100
but they don't give up the shackles.

200
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,860
The first piece is the first they
said it makes starts now Pam,

201
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,230
this is the first time.

202
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:58,470
Yeah.

203
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,370
This is actually the first show.

204
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:01,990
One of the first scripted shows.

205
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:02,800
Who says that?

206
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,300
That was always at the motto for MTV but
they make sure people now they'd have

207
00:05:07,301 --> 00:05:07,721
to pay them.

208
00:05:07,721 --> 00:05:08,554
Huh?

209
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:11,030
No hilarious hundred totally towels.

210
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:15,990
They also make money going to clubs
and Oh and and sponsoring a party.

211
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:16,853
So we'll,

212
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:17,890
we'll give you 40 grand,

213
00:05:17,891 --> 00:05:19,030
50 grand just to come to this,

214
00:05:19,031 --> 00:05:19,261
to,

215
00:05:19,261 --> 00:05:19,931
to this club.

216
00:05:19,931 --> 00:05:21,790
This nightclub will make
an appearance of Paris.

217
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,780
Hilton made millions that way.

218
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,280
Whole areas.

219
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,151
That's it.

220
00:05:25,151 --> 00:05:25,984
Ladies and gentlemen,

221
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:28,150
Brian Collins on the podcast,

222
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:32,230
follow him on Twitter and eventually
falling on the Bryan count experience.

223
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,140
Right at the front counter is Paula

224
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,470
and my friend is whether or not it's nice.

225
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:39,310
I like,

226
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:40,620
we get pretty hot up here too.

227
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,463
Is My favorite.

228
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,280
I like la in the winter
because there's actual weather,

229
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:46,780
you know?

230
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,270
I liked when it rains out there man,

231
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,360
but it's weird.

232
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,900
How did you ever think like you,

233
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:52,960
you grew up in Phoenix.

234
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:55,600
Do you ever think that you could live
in a place like Seattle where it rained

235
00:05:55,601 --> 00:05:56,140
all the time?

236
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:56,973
Do you ever think about it?

237
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:57,800
I could,

238
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,250
but

239
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,950
I think once you're
around it for that long,

240
00:06:00,951 --> 00:06:01,910
you would start to hate it.

241
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:02,601
Yeah.

242
00:06:02,601 --> 00:06:02,871
You know,

243
00:06:02,871 --> 00:06:04,370
just like just like the people in Seattle.

244
00:06:04,371 --> 00:06:07,100
I mean there's a lot of people from
Seattle live in Arizona and they just want

245
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:10,720
to get out of the rain because there's
not a lot of writing in Arizona and then

246
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:11,630
you know,

247
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,130
then they start to hate it after a while.

248
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:15,500
It seems like a place where you
can only live for a little while.

249
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:16,850
Like maybe you could do a year there,

250
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,890
but I think if you live there
for a long period of time,

251
00:06:18,891 --> 00:06:19,641
you probably go crazy.

252
00:06:19,641 --> 00:06:21,440
It'd be fun to go there and just write,

253
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:22,540
get all depressed.

254
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,730
Something about rain that
makes me want to write.

255
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:25,970
Like if really starts to rain,

256
00:06:25,971 --> 00:06:27,020
I want to rush home and right.

257
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,093
So like,

258
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,223
yeah,

259
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,200
I got,

260
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:30,731
I got it dude.

261
00:06:30,731 --> 00:06:32,930
I got to reign mix like
a rain writing mix.

262
00:06:32,931 --> 00:06:34,100
Am I on my iPod?

263
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:34,880
Really?

264
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,181
Yeah.

265
00:06:35,181 --> 00:06:37,250
So you like listen to like fake rain fall.

266
00:06:37,251 --> 00:06:37,950
It's like real random.

267
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:38,160
No,

268
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:38,871
not like that.

269
00:06:38,871 --> 00:06:41,690
Like there's just certain music sets.

270
00:06:41,691 --> 00:06:42,111
The mood.

271
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:42,830
Yeah.

272
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:43,970
What is the rain mix?

273
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,850
It's a little bring it up.

274
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,310
Stuff like Dave Matthews band.

275
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,640
There's just some like really?

276
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:50,890
Yeah,

277
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:52,810
chill music.

278
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,730
Something that just makes me want
to write about sucking dicks.

279
00:06:57,731 --> 00:06:58,564
And

280
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,380
she was like,

281
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,210
you purposely leave the
sticker on your hat.

282
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,313
Yes.

283
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,020
Is that,

284
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:04,853
what does that mean?

285
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,630
Don't shut us down bro.

286
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,490
I'm fucking two gangsters
or take off the tag.

287
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,063
There's this,

288
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:17,620
there's this famous video where like
there was this huge riot in some kind of a

289
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:18,710
high school assembly.

290
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:23,740
Like and after this fight they showed
what was on the floor and it was all those

291
00:07:23,931 --> 00:07:28,700
stickers and white towels do you know to
like wipe off your forehead and put it

292
00:07:28,701 --> 00:07:29,534
over your shoulder.

293
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,810
But it was just like at least
20 towels and like 30 stickers,

294
00:07:32,811 --> 00:07:33,091
hats,

295
00:07:33,091 --> 00:07:33,924
sticks.

296
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,200
How about these guys that
don't even bend their bill?

297
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,160
It's just raised.

298
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:40,990
It looks ridiculous.

299
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:41,823
Word choice.

300
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:42,560
That choice.

301
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,393
Not a wide choice.

302
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,833
I would never do it.

303
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,790
It's something about it
that just screams ethnic.

304
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:47,960
Right?

305
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,793
Why is that?

306
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,370
So this is this crafting since the crafty
move they can get a lot of chances and

307
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:53,204
not all of them work.

308
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:55,640
Remember when people were wearing the
clothes backwards cause the Kris kross

309
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,520
jump didn't work,

310
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,510
didn't work.

311
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,530
It worked for a little while,

312
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,450
for a bunch of times for those,

313
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:05,240
there's some days where you can go to
the mall and see kids walking around with

314
00:08:05,241 --> 00:08:10,241
the pants on backwards or they
shaved the Z Z cover each year.

315
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:16,520
I had a pair off calvary cheese at one
point in time that were like almost like

316
00:08:16,521 --> 00:08:20,900
elastic here and they pulled in tight
and snug here and then they got to hear

317
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:24,170
and they puffed out the
puffed out and it was great.

318
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,670
Walk around and if you want
to dance some nice motion.

319
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:31,360
Josh McDermitt.

320
00:08:31,361 --> 00:08:33,260
Ladies and gentlemen
follow Josh on Twitter.

321
00:08:33,261 --> 00:08:34,360
It's [inaudible].

322
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:36,290
D.

323
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:36,290
E.

324
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:36,290
R.

325
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:36,290
M.

326
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:36,290
I.

327
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:36,290
T.

328
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:36,600
T.

329
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,820
It's a tricky spelling.

330
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,340
Changing that for the public.

331
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:41,870
I want to change it to Ott,

332
00:08:41,871 --> 00:08:43,370
but there's too many dudes out.

333
00:08:43,371 --> 00:08:43,491
What?

334
00:08:43,491 --> 00:08:44,121
Ott?

335
00:08:44,121 --> 00:08:44,361
Yeah,

336
00:08:44,361 --> 00:08:46,840
you know me to change it to that.

337
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,530
You should leave it alone.

338
00:08:48,531 --> 00:08:49,820
Look Swartz now you can get through.

339
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:50,630
Come on son.

340
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,830
I'm going to change it to Josh.

341
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:52,880
Coco Diaz,

342
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:55,970
we it just,

343
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,233
Joe

344
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:01,050
should Jitsu representation by Joe Diaz.

345
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:02,243
Joe Diaz.

346
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:03,780
We just got done with the podcast,

347
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:07,560
another fantastic performance
by the Great Joe Diaz.

348
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,880
Finance human being on earth.

349
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:10,800
Loose.

350
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,640
You let me loose.

351
00:09:11,641 --> 00:09:12,474
You know what I'm saying?

352
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,500
People don't want to let me loose.

353
00:09:13,501 --> 00:09:14,700
They want to put the cross in front of me.

354
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,100
[inaudible] radio this
morning and I said Shit.

355
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,090
And they asked me to stop,

356
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,470
stop swearing and stuff.

357
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:19,840
I was so,

358
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,521
I'm so sorry.

359
00:09:20,521 --> 00:09:23,100
I'm so used to doing my
podcast and then I said fuck.

360
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:23,731
And then I said,

361
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:24,564
shit again.

362
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,590
That's an asshole.

363
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,610
Yeah,

364
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:27,930
they had me on for 50 minutes,

365
00:09:27,931 --> 00:09:28,440
man.

366
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,690
You had me on the phone for
50 minutes and you know,

367
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,670
I started getting passionate talking
about fighting and you know this and that

368
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:35,870
match ups and you know,

369
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:36,411
one guy,

370
00:09:36,411 --> 00:09:37,760
his attributes and another guy's,

371
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,880
he's got the counter that and I
get crazy and I start swearing,

372
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:44,070
but it's because of the podcast.

373
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:46,020
You get so used to just
expressing yourself.

374
00:09:46,021 --> 00:09:46,854
It's hard.

375
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:47,670
Yeah.

376
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,001
Yeah.

377
00:09:48,001 --> 00:09:48,870
Talking normal.

378
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:49,951
It's really hard,

379
00:09:49,951 --> 00:09:50,161
man.

380
00:09:50,161 --> 00:09:54,480
When I go on regular radio shows and I
always go on bullet [inaudible] when was

381
00:09:54,481 --> 00:09:55,990
the last time you get a radio
show and you weren't high?

382
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:57,660
Was that I did anything.

383
00:09:57,661 --> 00:09:58,494
It wasn't hot,

384
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,960
but it's pointless to do radio.

385
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:04,320
That marijuana is a conversation enhancer.

386
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:04,921
I mean,

387
00:10:04,921 --> 00:10:05,790
you don't want to go,

388
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:06,993
you're right there.

389
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:10,320
You don't want to go so
high that you can't talk.

390
00:10:10,321 --> 00:10:10,531
You know,

391
00:10:10,531 --> 00:10:11,430
you gotta be careful.

392
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,000
You know,

393
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,930
I've done that before.

394
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:15,570
It got so high that I can't formulate
proper sentences and I'm like,

395
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:15,731
oh,

396
00:10:15,731 --> 00:10:17,040
I can't talk right now.

397
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,720
My goal is to get new Chuck's tomorrow.

398
00:10:18,721 --> 00:10:20,040
That's how I want to start getting,

399
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,820
I want us to be able to go chess.

400
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:22,590
Like Nick Diaz.

401
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:23,750
Did you ever see the video that

402
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,570
mother fucker with known Chael is good.

403
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,810
That's when you know your Beth.

404
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:31,470
He put the video private
on youtube though.

405
00:10:31,471 --> 00:10:32,400
The best video,

406
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,331
the best video was,

407
00:10:33,331 --> 00:10:34,710
he was on the conference call.

408
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:36,290
He was supposed to be fighting,

409
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,800
think it was mine as a romps gifts.

410
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,080
I think this is a romps kiss.

411
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:43,470
He's supposed to be fighting the romps
gifts and he's on a conference call and

412
00:10:43,471 --> 00:10:44,710
like he like leads in the compost pile.

413
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:44,971
I was like,

414
00:10:44,971 --> 00:10:45,480
you know,

415
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:45,901
I just,

416
00:10:45,901 --> 00:10:46,500
uh,

417
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,300
I ain't no bitch.

418
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:47,700
You know,

419
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,950
I'll fight fight.

420
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:52,720
They steps away from the conference
call and you hear him hit the bar,

421
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:57,380
you can hear him hit the bug and then
he comes back and he starts doing noon

422
00:10:57,381 --> 00:10:58,080
chucks.

423
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,360
So while they're on this conference call,

424
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:03,540
he's got the thing on and they're
asking him questions and he's out there

425
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:04,181
fucking do it.

426
00:11:04,181 --> 00:11:06,540
Noon checks as high as fuck and he button.

427
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:10,050
And he says he's got a
way to clean himself out.

428
00:11:10,051 --> 00:11:12,300
He said he just stopped
smoking weed 10 days out.

429
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:13,720
He said 10 days ago.

430
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:14,110
Yes.

431
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,000
But he has no body.

432
00:11:15,001 --> 00:11:15,361
Finally,

433
00:11:15,361 --> 00:11:16,470
there's so much cardio.

434
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,660
He doesn't even let it get to the cells.

435
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,240
But the only time that he didn't do that,

436
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,680
who was a the gummy fight,

437
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:27,240
he tested positive for the gummy fight
and they said there was so much weed in

438
00:11:27,241 --> 00:11:31,170
his system when they tested him that
he had to be high when he was fighting.

439
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,180
So what he did was just get

440
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,790
just completely ripped and then
went out there and fought tack,

441
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:38,090
annoyed,

442
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:43,090
go me and just outbox and pride and
feel bad and then submitted him.

443
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,690
Hey,

444
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:48,900
it's safer over there.

445
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,210
No,

446
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:50,340
I want it submitted him.

447
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:52,710
You can pick up on how
many things should do.

448
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:54,070
Think about what level.

449
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:54,790
I mean,

450
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:55,061
you know,

451
00:11:55,061 --> 00:11:55,540
you didn't do,

452
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,390
you'd have like smoked and got on stage.

453
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,130
And also when they,

454
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:02,680
you asking me and I said try it
once a long time ago by accident.

455
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:07,810
I don't only smoke pot and maybe a half,

456
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:11,410
a dozen times in my whole life until I
was 30 and it was usually like at a party

457
00:12:11,411 --> 00:12:12,580
I had a couple of drinks or whatever.

458
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:13,750
And that's what happened.

459
00:12:13,751 --> 00:12:14,351
Once I was at,

460
00:12:14,351 --> 00:12:14,650
uh,

461
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:15,850
my roommates and I,

462
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,410
uh,

463
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:18,610
one of one of my roommates
friends with is the January,

464
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,503
always smoked weed.

465
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:21,760
And so we all over the house and
I didn't smoke weed at the time,

466
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,680
but we're thinking,

467
00:12:23,681 --> 00:12:24,220
what the hell,

468
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:24,570
you know,

469
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:24,860
all right,

470
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,140
everybody's smoking a little weed,

471
00:12:26,141 --> 00:12:26,860
I'll take a hit.

472
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:30,400
So I took a hit and I got super high
and I was super paranoid and I was like,

473
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:30,911
oh my God,

474
00:12:30,911 --> 00:12:32,620
I gotta go do comedy like this.

475
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:34,580
And I was really nervous to go do comedy.

476
00:12:34,581 --> 00:12:34,781
I'm like,

477
00:12:34,781 --> 00:12:36,250
I'm way too hard and
going on stage or not,

478
00:12:36,251 --> 00:12:37,084
I can't believe this.

479
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,560
I don't mode if I forget my material.

480
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:43,360
And I went up and Slade and it's like a
half feel for this material that I never

481
00:12:43,361 --> 00:12:44,194
had before,

482
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,760
but that was a long time ago.

483
00:12:45,761 --> 00:12:48,410
And then they get to do it
again until I was like 38.

484
00:12:48,411 --> 00:12:51,160
If you got to that level and you
could go in the ring and fight,

485
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:51,821
oh yeah,

486
00:12:51,821 --> 00:12:53,350
I would do it just for the sake of it.

487
00:12:53,351 --> 00:12:54,184
At that point,

488
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,510
especially against GSP,

489
00:12:55,511 --> 00:12:56,980
I get it fucking stoned.

490
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:01,330
Just enough like it's just see the punches
because you just get in the zone like

491
00:13:01,331 --> 00:13:03,010
he was doing against Bj Penn.

492
00:13:03,011 --> 00:13:04,840
He was just turning to
walking on him and sometimes,

493
00:13:04,841 --> 00:13:05,140
yeah.

494
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:07,000
How about when he stuck
his chin out and he's like,

495
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:10,030
it was fucking crazy.

496
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,350
Let and Bj Punch.

497
00:13:11,351 --> 00:13:11,670
I'm like,

498
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:11,870
God,

499
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:12,970
I sold a fight man,

500
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,200
and he's up in his GSP
and that's all that is.

501
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:15,731
Well,

502
00:13:15,731 --> 00:13:16,001
dude,

503
00:13:16,001 --> 00:13:16,960
after the fight was over,

504
00:13:16,961 --> 00:13:19,210
he was walking in the ring
and he's putting a shirt on.

505
00:13:19,211 --> 00:13:19,451
He said,

506
00:13:19,451 --> 00:13:19,541
well,

507
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:19,871
you act.

508
00:13:19,871 --> 00:13:21,400
George met George.

509
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,370
He's putting his shirt.

510
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:22,631
I was like,

511
00:13:22,631 --> 00:13:22,760
well,

512
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,593
you at George,

513
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,290
like he just beat the fuck out
of Bj Penn and he's not happy.

514
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:27,640
He's walking around the ring going,

515
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:28,530
where are you at George?

516
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,670
Will you act George like yelling at the,

517
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,181
at the look,

518
00:13:31,181 --> 00:13:32,014
look into the camera.

519
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:32,211
Well,

520
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:33,070
you at George,

521
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:36,730
he sold it because George
St Pierre was so mad.

522
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:37,300
He sold,

523
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,140
he was so mad.

524
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:38,861
George St Pierre,

525
00:13:38,861 --> 00:13:39,101
who's like,

526
00:13:39,101 --> 00:13:40,960
please let me fight him.

527
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,400
He so disrespectful.

528
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,410
George wanted to fight him and he said,

529
00:13:44,411 --> 00:13:44,940
he was like,

530
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:45,280
ah.

531
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,110
He had this expression in French.

532
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,940
It's the French equivalent to,

533
00:13:48,941 --> 00:13:51,220
you've got to strike while
the iron is hot and it's true.

534
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,090
You know,

535
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:53,080
if they fought,

536
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:53,381
you know,

537
00:13:53,381 --> 00:13:55,990
if he fought Carlos
condit and then Nick Diaz,

538
00:13:55,991 --> 00:13:56,824
fuck someone else.

539
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:57,700
Somebody could lose,

540
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:58,490
you know,

541
00:13:58,490 --> 00:13:59,860
calls candidates got down killer.

542
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,360
Anybody can lose Carlos condit,

543
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:01,850
you know,

544
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:04,840
and who the hell knows and somebody
might be able to be Ellenberger.

545
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,370
Ellenberger might be
able to beat Nick Diaz.

546
00:14:06,371 --> 00:14:07,110
He might take them down.

547
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:07,660
He might,

548
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,520
he might knock them out and
mean we were fucked house.

549
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:10,780
If fights are crazy,

550
00:14:10,781 --> 00:14:11,030
man,

551
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,160
anything can happen in a fight.

552
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:15,820
But got Damn Nick Diaz
is exciting addition.

553
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,260
He's an exciting addition.

554
00:14:17,261 --> 00:14:18,080
He's crazy.

555
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,210
It goes to going to sell the most
paper views really ever seen.

556
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:22,323
Ever dark.

557
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,880
Do you know how great the press
conference is going to be with nick?

558
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,110
If he shows,

559
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:28,270
if he shows he shows Davis.

560
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:28,860
I said,

561
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:29,620
don't fire me.

562
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,131
I'm ready.

563
00:14:30,131 --> 00:14:30,964
I'm done.

564
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:32,183
I ain't no bitch.

565
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:35,120
I ain't no black.

566
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:35,820
Stay black.

567
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,060
What's love stay black.

568
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:45,490
[inaudible]

569
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:21,843
yeah,

570
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:26,863
yeah.

571
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:27,813
That's not good.

572
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,260
Is that like a Mike Tyson mask?

573
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:30,041
Is that what's it look like?

574
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:30,874
It right.

575
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:31,380
No,

576
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,870
like a distorted money monster.

577
00:15:32,871 --> 00:15:37,120
Buton Mike Tyson because he said that
Mike Tyson lie off each asshole a lot.

578
00:15:37,121 --> 00:15:37,830
Bitch.

579
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:40,030
It's like a famous Tyson line.

580
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,170
That's not a good song.

581
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:41,580
I mean,

582
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,251
I wonder what happened.

583
00:15:42,251 --> 00:15:44,560
Maybe they became famous and
then they started to suck.

584
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,610
It happens to people.

585
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,500
It's good when the girls
seeing it's kind of cool.

586
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,250
Really just like the rap
doesn't move fast enough.

587
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:52,001
Well not only that,

588
00:15:52,001 --> 00:15:53,410
the whole fucking in the ass thing.

589
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:55,870
Dj had tickets [inaudible]
like who let them?

590
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,950
Who didn't say no?

591
00:15:56,951 --> 00:15:57,611
This is dom.

592
00:15:57,611 --> 00:15:58,210
I was saying this,

593
00:15:58,210 --> 00:15:59,120
what you're talking about that,

594
00:15:59,121 --> 00:15:59,401
where's it,

595
00:15:59,401 --> 00:16:00,400
who's his manager?

596
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,293
Is there

597
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:05,080
someone who edits the software,

598
00:16:05,081 --> 00:16:05,914
listens to it.

599
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:07,360
Who like assesses their work.

600
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:07,720
You know,

601
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,630
they assessed that and we won and I'm
pretty happy with this Dj Hyde type of

602
00:16:10,631 --> 00:16:11,464
fucking in the ass.

603
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:12,261
You Jihad tech.

604
00:16:12,261 --> 00:16:13,094
We'll fucking ass.

605
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,081
He's got a heart attack.

606
00:16:14,081 --> 00:16:14,710
The fucking like,

607
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,620
you're probably going to like
this song in two weeks though.

608
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:17,080
No Way.

609
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:17,920
You'll hear it again.

610
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:19,361
No,

611
00:16:19,361 --> 00:16:20,081
that's a bad song,

612
00:16:20,081 --> 00:16:20,380
dude.

613
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,213
That's dumb.

614
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,193
I love them.

615
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:23,320
I think you're great,

616
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,730
but I just think that it just,

617
00:16:24,731 --> 00:16:25,780
it's got weird rhythm.

618
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:26,930
So Sam Aaa,

619
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,500
another episode of the
podcast we just got done.

620
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:34,530
That was great to be back
in headquarters in Tripoli,

621
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:35,603

622

Figure it out.

643
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:00,670
Figure it out and make it happen.

644
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,013
Hi,

645
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,000
I think we've stepped into a time machine,

646
00:17:05,001 --> 00:17:05,700
so I'm going to show you.

647
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,750

We show us.

651
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,570
We show America yourself.

652
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,030
Please show the flip up.

653
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:12,864
All right,

654
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,890
we just did a the podcast and now what?

655
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,361
This is what we do,

656
00:17:18,361 --> 00:17:21,370
a little video blog thing
that we do with pocket rental.

657
00:17:21,371 --> 00:17:22,204
You're talking about,

658
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:22,531
well,

659
00:17:22,531 --> 00:17:24,390
it's all about getting
content to the freaks.

660
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,010
Make the connection to people.

661
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:26,730
I say,

662
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:27,360
you know what I'm saying?

663
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,320
I like the sunglasses.

664
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:28,720
Fuck it.

665
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,210
And especially at night it'll warrior.

666
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:34,650
I'm ready to fucking look at
fish through the water polarized.

667
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,610
This is where they did the
mock up training compound.

668
00:17:38,611 --> 00:17:39,790
I'm bidding on right out.

669
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:42,450
I just want to go home before
you came up with the camera.

670
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,850
Dave and I were talking about uh,

671
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:48,510
like recognizing old school comedians and
like we're both kind of historians and

672
00:17:48,511 --> 00:17:49,200
we were,

673
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,230
we were trying to figure out whether or
not we were being honest with ourselves

674
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:55,020
and where are they that good and where
we're trying to build them up but we're

675
00:17:55,021 --> 00:17:56,760
trying to keep it alive
and let people know.

676
00:17:56,761 --> 00:17:58,560
I think we're trying to keep
it alive and let people know.

677
00:17:58,950 --> 00:17:59,310
Yeah,

678
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:00,910
I was just going to say
that like what's it,

679
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:04,320
it's not so much building them up cause
they weren't great but it's like are

680
00:18:04,321 --> 00:18:06,220
they going to be as great
to this next generation?

681
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,530
Probably not because they have their own
people that they will have a chance to

682
00:18:08,531 --> 00:18:09,840
watch a Lenny Bruce uh,

683
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,260
record.

684
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:10,790
It's hard.

685
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:11,740
It's hard but you got to like,

686
00:18:11,741 --> 00:18:12,290
you know,

687
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:13,330
see it from that perspective.

688
00:18:13,331 --> 00:18:15,010
Cause comic does an age like music.

689
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:16,870
So that's what it is,

690
00:18:16,871 --> 00:18:17,440
you know?

691
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:17,711
Yeah.

692
00:18:17,711 --> 00:18:18,460
Comedy,

693
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,450
except for the stooges,

694
00:18:19,451 --> 00:18:20,140
man,

695
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,070
they bring it hard.

696
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:23,500
Every little rascal is
really close to my face.

697
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:24,783
Fisheye.

698
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,010
He said it looks like it's right,

699
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:27,761
but I'm no,

700
00:18:27,761 --> 00:18:28,600
I was just thinking like,

701
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:28,931
oh we,

702
00:18:28,931 --> 00:18:32,770
oh we overplaying it to these younger
cats who don't really give a shit or are

703
00:18:32,771 --> 00:18:33,280
we just like,

704
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:33,460
you know,

705
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,860
some of them do the right fight
and you know some of them,

706
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:36,850
some of them are going to you,

707
00:18:36,851 --> 00:18:39,010
but that's because people are
going to complain about everything.

708
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:40,660
So I figured it was a comedy fan,

709
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:41,494
you know?

710
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:42,610
That's all right.

711
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:43,361
Well listen man,

712
00:18:43,361 --> 00:18:43,551
when I,

713
00:18:43,551 --> 00:18:44,620
before I was a comic,

714
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,281
you know,

715
00:18:45,281 --> 00:18:46,690
I mean I've always been a comedy fan,

716
00:18:46,691 --> 00:18:47,620
but before I was a comic,

717
00:18:47,621 --> 00:18:48,490
when I was a comedy fan,

718
00:18:48,491 --> 00:18:50,080
I wouldn't want to hear
and heard this stuff.

719
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:51,241
Oh yeah.

720
00:18:51,241 --> 00:18:51,570
Right.

721
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:52,670
I heard it know you're a comic.

722
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:53,470
Oh God.

723
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:54,480
Oh Steve Martin.

724
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:56,580
Just sitting around every
week doing three times.

725
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:57,443
That'd be amazing.

726
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,760
How awesome would it be
to watch Steve Martin too?

727
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:00,661
I was there.

728
00:19:00,661 --> 00:19:02,340
I saw him a couple of times,

729
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,140
see Kennison live.

730
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:04,980
I never saw him say.

731
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:05,850
That's one of my regrets.

732
00:19:05,851 --> 00:19:07,140
I wish I had seen him live.

733
00:19:07,141 --> 00:19:08,700
I saw Kennison live three times,

734
00:19:08,701 --> 00:19:11,130
I think once when he was still hot.

735
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:14,940
And then once at the end where he was
just was rock Russell Good anymore?

736
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:15,271
Yeah,

737
00:19:15,271 --> 00:19:16,021
it was bad.

738
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:16,860
It was amazing.

739
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:17,701
It was like I go,

740
00:19:17,701 --> 00:19:20,030
I got to watch the full metamorphoses,

741
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:20,873
the full,

742
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:21,600
you know,

743
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,800
getting sucked into Hollywood.

744
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:23,701
But at first saw him,

745
00:19:23,701 --> 00:19:27,630
it was like 87 86 87 holy shit.

746
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:30,090
I saw him at Great Woods
Center for the performing arts.

747
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:30,981
God Damn,

748
00:19:30,981 --> 00:19:32,280
he fucking destroyed.

749
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,061
He destroyed.

750
00:19:33,061 --> 00:19:36,300
And he had this bit at the end where he
would take someone from the audience and

751
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:38,910
bring them on stage and they would tell
a story about how some girl broke her

752
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:39,661
heart and call it,

753
00:19:39,661 --> 00:19:40,920
pull out a phone and call it.

754
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:41,783
Yeah Dude,

755
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:42,540
he was a,

756
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,380
he crushed,

757
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,230
he crushed.

758
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,120
Everybody just left.

759
00:19:45,121 --> 00:19:46,170
They're shaking their heads like,

760
00:19:46,171 --> 00:19:47,250
God damn,

761
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:49,420
he's the one guy that
you can watch and not.

762
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:50,300
And now we're doing it again.

763
00:19:50,301 --> 00:19:51,590
But this is true to me.

764
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:52,870
This is my truth with a,

765
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,571
with watching him,

766
00:19:53,571 --> 00:19:55,880
it's like he's the one guy
that I think never got,

767
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:58,190
never was respected as
a comic because his,

768
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:01,400
his rock and roll life
overplayed his comedy.

769
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,200
But when I watched him to this day,

770
00:20:03,201 --> 00:20:07,130
I feel like he's right in the room with
me in my fucking phase and I'm shaking

771
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:07,521
with like,

772
00:20:07,521 --> 00:20:08,450
just fucking power.

773
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,321
It's his power,

774
00:20:09,321 --> 00:20:09,830
you know,

775
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:10,760
he's like bang,

776
00:20:10,761 --> 00:20:11,031
Bang,

777
00:20:11,031 --> 00:20:11,380
Bang.

778
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:15,050
And I love that [inaudible]
says is fucking just man.

779
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,210
It's just like he's painting
pictures up there and I love it.

780
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:17,961
Yeah.

781
00:20:17,961 --> 00:20:18,520
Yeah.

782
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,353
And did it,

783
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:21,350
nobody had done it again
about hearing this shit.

784
00:20:21,351 --> 00:20:21,501
Yeah.

785
00:20:21,501 --> 00:20:22,180
Yeah.

786
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:22,790
He,

787
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:23,960
when I first saw him,

788
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:24,351
uh,

789
00:20:24,351 --> 00:20:24,790
on the,

790
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,180
the first HBO special,

791
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:27,081
I maintain it.

792
00:20:27,081 --> 00:20:28,850
That's the best comedy
I've ever seen in my life.

793
00:20:28,851 --> 00:20:29,780
Still to this day.

794
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,440
His Rodney or no,

795
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:32,601
no,

796
00:20:32,601 --> 00:20:32,700
no.

797
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,580
His first one is,

798
00:20:33,581 --> 00:20:35,120
first is our special,

799
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:35,990
when he did a,

800
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:36,230
you know,

801
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:37,490
that Jesus on the cross

802
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,550
and the fucking thing that
he would do about the,

803
00:20:42,551 --> 00:20:42,751
the,

804
00:20:42,751 --> 00:20:45,650
the homosexual necrophilia acts in the,

805
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:46,041
come on,

806
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:46,251
man.

807
00:20:46,251 --> 00:20:47,600
That's some of the basket is great.

808
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:51,600
Ever saw and it was nobody was
anything like that beforehand?

809
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:52,140
No.

810
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,070
It was total paradigm shifting.

811
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,630
Screaming rage,

812
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:56,790
rage.

813
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,100
No fucking yes.

814
00:20:58,870 --> 00:20:59,703
Right.

815
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:01,031
And you would just,

816
00:21:01,031 --> 00:21:02,470
you just get sucked into it.

817
00:21:02,471 --> 00:21:04,090
It's like a different kind of comedy.

818
00:21:04,091 --> 00:21:06,640
It was completely different
than anything I'd seen before.

819
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:07,920
You're absolutely right man.

820
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,080
Cause that special now.

821
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:09,933
Now I'm thinking about it.

822
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:11,730
He owned that fucking room.

823
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,070
He owned that stage.

824
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:14,340
Went from being a preacher guy.

825
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,020
You fucking knew how to own it.

826
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:19,470
Fucking like everybody in the
room thought he's making iconic.

827
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:22,950
That's like a preacher thing where you
feel like he's talking to just you,

828
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:25,140
but he's talking to like a
couple of hundred people,

829
00:21:25,141 --> 00:21:25,920
thousand people.

830
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,060
You the story bucking them.

831
00:21:27,061 --> 00:21:28,050
It's really kind of crazy.

832
00:21:28,051 --> 00:21:28,710
I read his book.

833
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:29,450
Did you ever read his book?

834
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:30,300
My brother Sam,

835
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:32,310
his brother Bill wrote a book about Shit.

836
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:33,360
I did read that book.

837
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:33,660
Yeah,

838
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:36,330
he got hit by a car when he was a
little kid and it totally changed his

839
00:21:36,331 --> 00:21:37,164
personality.

840
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:40,950
He got fucked up by a car
and he got injured his head.

841
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:45,240
And after that became like reckless
and wild wasn't a different person.

842
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,510
So it's like he was created
almost by an accident.

843
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:50,190
I used to run into his brother,

844
00:21:50,191 --> 00:21:52,950
like occasionally like doing things
like Montreal comedy festivals and stuff

845
00:21:52,951 --> 00:21:53,370
like that.

846
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:55,920
And I always felt like I had
just gotten off and I felt like,

847
00:21:55,921 --> 00:21:56,130
you know,

848
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:56,371
hey,

849
00:21:56,371 --> 00:21:56,970
I really,

850
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:57,803
really nailed it.

851
00:21:57,870 --> 00:21:59,050
And then I would see him and I'd be like,

852
00:21:59,260 --> 00:21:59,501
you know,

853
00:21:59,501 --> 00:22:00,320
like,

854
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,890
I'm sorry if I,

855
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:02,790
you know,

856
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:02,971
um,

857
00:22:02,971 --> 00:22:03,680
nothing,

858
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,320
you know,

859
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:04,741
I felt like,

860
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:04,861
you know,

861
00:22:04,861 --> 00:22:07,080
this guy actually saw like perfection.

862
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:07,943
Oh yeah.

863
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:09,090
When I first met,

864
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:09,420
uh,

865
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,830
due to worked with Hicks,

866
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:11,730
I was like one of the,

867
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:12,350
that's another one.

868
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:15,870
This one of the college as for myself
or you're just trying to do my things.

869
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:16,580
That's,

870
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:20,940
that's another great comedy club that
no longer is great or even going to the

871
00:22:20,941 --> 00:22:21,230
laugh,

872
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:23,320
stop and use that.

873
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:25,020
Fortunately bones on that one.

874
00:22:25,021 --> 00:22:26,370
That was great club.

875
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,121
That was one of those,

876
00:22:27,121 --> 00:22:27,810
love that club.

877
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:28,021
Yeah.

878
00:22:28,021 --> 00:22:31,350
Wild West shootout clubs
you got was just chaos,

879
00:22:31,351 --> 00:22:31,591
man.

880
00:22:31,591 --> 00:22:33,840
We had some fun times and that was sweet.

881
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:34,770
That was a sweet ride,

882
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:34,951
man.

883
00:22:34,951 --> 00:22:35,400
That was it.

884
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,930
That was definitely like every you,

885
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:38,280
you look forward to that place.

886
00:22:38,281 --> 00:22:40,380
And then of course I'm Craig Guy,

887
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:40,950
you know,

888
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:42,360
the glazer brothers and I,

889
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:43,200
and actually one of the,

890
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:45,660
one of the glazer brother's
just died in Kansas City.

891
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:46,261
Oh really?

892
00:22:46,261 --> 00:22:46,551
You know,

893
00:22:46,551 --> 00:22:47,110
um,

894
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:47,943
Craig.

895
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:48,601
Thanks brother.

896
00:22:48,601 --> 00:22:48,930
Yeah.

897
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:49,360
Oh really?

898
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:49,921
Car Accident.

899
00:22:49,921 --> 00:22:50,430
Yeah,

900
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:51,263
but no juice,

901
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,313
uh,

902
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,480
that David tell him down this week,

903
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:57,300
three days a radio.

904
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,080
Um,

905
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:58,651
you're up for it.

906
00:22:58,651 --> 00:22:59,484
Right.

907
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:00,810
He would get you up.

908
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:03,110
You would have to do that
one local guy in Kansas City.

909
00:23:03,111 --> 00:23:05,240
They don't like the big time
rock and roll guy in Kansas City.

910
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:05,970
His name.

911
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:07,180
Oh yes,

912
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:07,580
yes.

913
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,290
He hit Johnny blaze rise.

914
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:09,840
Johnny,

915
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,341
let me come on,

916
00:23:10,341 --> 00:23:10,511
man.

917
00:23:10,511 --> 00:23:11,900
It's a big supporter of comedy.

918
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:12,680
He's a good guy.

919
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,580
Johnny blaze.

920
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,830
And how cool it that you
can't get cooler than that.

921
00:23:15,831 --> 00:23:16,664
That was his name.

922
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:18,430
He's a local radio DJ.

923
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:21,000
His name's Johnny blaze
and he's cool show.

924
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:21,801
It's fun to do,

925
00:23:21,801 --> 00:23:22,130
man.

926
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:22,911
I only did it once,

927
00:23:22,911 --> 00:23:23,870
but it was fucking cool.

928
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:24,231
Yeah,

929
00:23:24,231 --> 00:23:24,921
he was,

930
00:23:24,921 --> 00:23:25,221
it was,

931
00:23:25,221 --> 00:23:25,780
uh,

932
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:26,260
that,

933
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:29,190
that was another wild west comedy Kaplan.

934
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:29,590
So,

935
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:30,110
uh,

936
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,970
we're going down comedy history.

937
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:35,680
Somebody say,

938
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,300
well this is a bit Sony and you know,

939
00:23:37,301 --> 00:23:38,590
you get to like fucking actually,

940
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:39,370
you know,

941
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:40,270
because we both know it

942
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:40,991
for us.

943
00:23:40,991 --> 00:23:42,110
I think it's also like,

944
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:42,590
uh,

945
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:43,180
you know,

946
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:46,160
two soldiers out there in the world
that don't get a chance to meet

947
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,510
up to a ballerina.

948
00:23:47,511 --> 00:23:50,000
Talk about ballerinas are
professional jazz players.

949
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:52,430
It can be a lot of pokey mon experts.

950
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:54,060
You,

951
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:54,351
you know,

952
00:23:54,351 --> 00:23:55,340
you get together and you,

953
00:23:55,341 --> 00:23:55,611
you know,

954
00:23:55,611 --> 00:23:58,700
you could talk about shit
that we mentioned earlier.

955
00:23:58,770 --> 00:23:59,603
Yeah.

956
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,370
Well we know it made us who we are,

957
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:02,480
but it was also like,

958
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:02,990
you know,

959
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:04,310
it'll never be that way again.

960
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:05,510
So it's like,

961
00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:06,050
you know,

962
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:06,883
whatever.

963
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:08,300
In La Right now,

964
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:10,030
La has a pretty good helps that scene.

965
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:10,700
I really hope so.

966
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,140
It's one of the best
scenes in the country,

967
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,161
if not the best.

968
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:15,440
That's it's only on New York
is the only competition,

969
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:15,981
you know,

970
00:24:15,981 --> 00:24:16,281
and it's all,

971
00:24:16,281 --> 00:24:16,760
it's left.

972
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,750
It's New York and La.

973
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:18,860
That was pretty good right now.

974
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:19,281
But you know,

975
00:24:19,281 --> 00:24:21,950
there's some kid out there
listen to your podcasts.

976
00:24:21,951 --> 00:24:23,480
He's fucking brilliant.

977
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:23,770
Yeah,

978
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:26,180
and he's stepfathers yelling
at him right now and he's,

979
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:27,130
he's fucking working,

980
00:24:27,131 --> 00:24:27,964
you know,

981
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:28,880
at staples.

982
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:30,890
But all in all night long.

983
00:24:30,891 --> 00:24:32,930
He's just watching comedy central
fucking thing and the jokes.

984
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,040
That's the key.

985
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:34,220
Right?

986
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,060
He didn't make his debut.

987
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:37,990
I'm ready to group on a ticket for it,

988
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:38,580

989

You grew up man.

1032
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:33,564
Grooming your neck.

1033
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:34,271
Oh yeah,

1034
00:25:34,271 --> 00:25:34,830

1035
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:35,431
Look at this shit,

1036
00:25:35,431 --> 00:25:36,100
man.

1037
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,010
I got to separate it

1038
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:42,600
back in it and that here manly man.

1039
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,473
That's

1040
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:45,880
fucking Harry Savage.

1041
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,130
And what you don't want to get up?

1042
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,580
Well my how high this is about to get,

1043
00:25:50,581 --> 00:25:51,510
I also sweat a lot.

1044
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:52,340
Yeah,

1045
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:54,030
I can see you with a knife.

1046
00:25:54,031 --> 00:25:55,390
Thing of teeth climbing a rope

1047
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,400
on the lady's sure.

1048
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:00,760
Thanks.

1049
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,080
What is your nationality?

1050
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:03,973
Um,

1051
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:06,640
more than half Spanish from Spain,

1052
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,513
from Spain.

1053
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:10,270
My mom is 100% Peruvian,

1054
00:26:10,271 --> 00:26:13,120
but she has Spanish and French blood.

1055
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:16,390
There's gotta be some local
Indian English right there too,

1056
00:26:16,391 --> 00:26:16,751
I guess.

1057
00:26:16,751 --> 00:26:17,980
But she's mostly that.

1058
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,450
My Dad is Spanish,

1059
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,440
French and Irish.

1060
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:20,710
Yeah.

1061
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:21,070
Wow.

1062
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,540
That's an interesting combination man.

1063
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:22,880
Yeah.

1064
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,540
And you said that's a funny thing
about Thomas and he speaks fluent

1065
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,330
fashion and people have noticed
they talk a little shit around them.

1066
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:30,580
As soon as a Mexican dudes
talk some shit around.

1067
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,050
Yeah.

1068
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:31,530
What the fuck?

1069
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:32,700
That's why I turned to them.

1070
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,753
You go

1071
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,540
join my new favorite comic.

1072
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:40,420
Funny Chord.

1073
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:40,680
She

1074
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,300
cheese.

1075
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:41,630
Yeah.

1076
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:43,710
Can you speak Mexican or
you speak some Hungarian,

1077
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:44,130
which is

1078
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:44,963
crazy language.

1079
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:45,630
You would,

1080
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:46,710
you would really enjoy this.

1081
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:48,300
Hungarian has the,

1082
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:48,930
uh,

1083
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:51,910
all the languages that basically
they've done studies on has the most uh,

1084
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,760
curse words and insults.

1085
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:54,330
Really.

1086
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:56,340
Some of the insults are so
imaginative or creative.

1087
00:26:56,341 --> 00:26:57,900
Tell him like,

1088
00:26:57,970 --> 00:27:01,190
say it can say the worst
thing is [inaudible].

1089
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:06,000
It means your mother is leader of the
Horse and God fucks her and harass hall

1090
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:13,170
and that's a common fuck.

1091
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,110
Fuck you.

1092
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:16,230
You're fucking dad says,

1093
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:17,850
oh yeah,

1094
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,920
I learned that.

1095
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:21,050
But he said,

1096
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:21,500
you say it,

1097
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,520
you say it when you're driving.

1098
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:24,643
It's like nuts.

1099
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,190
A quarter by ish then boss,

1100
00:27:27,191 --> 00:27:28,024
some egg.

1101
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:28,720
Oh,

1102
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,530
quarterback.

1103
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:31,640
[inaudible]

1104
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:36,050
summary of what each then wow.

1105
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,420
The first time she said it to me,

1106
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:39,171
I was just like,

1107
00:27:39,171 --> 00:27:41,390
what are you doing tomorrow is a good one.

1108
00:27:41,391 --> 00:27:41,670
I like,

1109
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:43,250
it's so economical.

1110
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:45,140
Like you could say so much with this,

1111
00:27:45,141 --> 00:27:46,430
this Acorda each day.

1112
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:47,283
Apostle man.

1113
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:49,790
And what is the English translation?

1114
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:50,301
Well,

1115
00:27:50,301 --> 00:27:52,630
it's just like your mother
is the leader of the horse.

1116
00:27:52,631 --> 00:27:54,290
She's a big whore and then got it.

1117
00:27:54,291 --> 00:27:55,610
Fucks her in her ass.

1118
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,340
It's amazing that you
could see that so quick.

1119
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:03,360
And I know do most of May to say your
mother is the leader of the horrors and

1120
00:28:04,221 --> 00:28:04,551
God,

1121
00:28:04,551 --> 00:28:05,384
fuck sure.

1122
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:07,173
So

1123
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,270
if you tried to say that
to somebody in English,

1124
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:10,700
they'd be like,

1125
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,533
you want to wrap it up?

1126
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,310
I do.

1127
00:28:17,311 --> 00:28:22,311
Where you know we have the ribbon or
even comedian trickles down to like the

1128
00:28:22,651 --> 00:28:23,970
Christmas carols for kids.

1129
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,340
It's funny though because the
Christmas Carol like it's silly,

1130
00:28:29,341 --> 00:28:31,130
but kids know it was the Christmas Carol.

1131
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:32,611
Sure.

1132
00:28:32,611 --> 00:28:32,881
Yeah.

1133
00:28:32,881 --> 00:28:36,300
You should say hey and
goes as she got a whole

1134
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:38,930
sidewalk.

1135
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:39,600
Khakis.

1136
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,470
Chico.

1137
00:28:40,471 --> 00:28:40,711
Okay,

1138
00:28:40,711 --> 00:28:42,540
so that's what you teach like yellow kids,

1139
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:42,860
right?

1140
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:43,693
What does it mean?

1141
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:47,980
It means the snow is falling
and all the cows are,

1142
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:48,181
oh,

1143
00:28:48,181 --> 00:28:48,511
I'm sorry.

1144
00:28:48,511 --> 00:28:52,080
All the forces are farting
and the littlest horse.

1145
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,330
Why Christmas?

1146
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,200
It's like a fun song.

1147
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,750
Blew the fuck is wrong
with the rest of the world.

1148
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:11,900
This is the reason why man can need to
be the guiding light lead the rest of the

1149
00:29:11,901 --> 00:29:13,880
fucking world out of
the Goddamn Stone Age.

1150
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,273
No.

1151
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:16,711
