1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,620
The Joe Rogan experience,

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:03,480
that's what a real friend
does right where you go,

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:04,190
Huh?

4
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:06,040
I gotta actually reassess them.

5
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:06,441
You know,

6
00:00:06,441 --> 00:00:08,550
I love Michael Schirmer's quote,

7
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:09,720
Veuve read,

8
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:09,990
uh,

9
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:10,230
uh,

10
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:10,720
a,

11
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:14,430
I'm doing myself a great
disjustice injustice,

12
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:18,750
but bring up Michael Shermer right now
because I'll be a rape apologist because

13
00:00:18,751 --> 00:00:19,710
I don't know if you know about this.

14
00:00:19,711 --> 00:00:20,501
He was accused of,

15
00:00:20,501 --> 00:00:20,690
uh,

16
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,640
of doing something improper,

17
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:27,830
improper meaning getting a girl drunk
and having sex with her crazy that people

18
00:00:27,991 --> 00:00:29,820
are calling that a lot of people
are calling that rape now.

19
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:30,654
You never done that.

20
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:31,830
I don't know if that happened.

21
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:33,090
I don't know what happened.

22
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,110
You're drunk.

23
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,960
My point is I just needed to address,

24
00:00:35,961 --> 00:00:36,640
uh,

25
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,080
uh,

26
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,280
just to put it out there.

27
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:43,140
But the quote that is that he has is
that a lot of people that are very smart,

28
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,980
believed dump things because they can
explain them and they can argue them very

29
00:00:46,981 --> 00:00:47,490
well.

30
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:50,040
And so they think they're doing
well and winning in the argument.

31
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:51,270
So that may be their point.

32
00:00:51,271 --> 00:00:52,104
Makes Sense.

33
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,110
But it really becomes like a
sort of circular ego argument.

34
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:56,050
Sounds,

35
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:56,741
sounds good.

36
00:00:56,741 --> 00:01:01,060
They've got a good sounding argument to
be talked to like Michael Murphy and uh,

37
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:01,870
he,

38
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:03,340
he's very eloquent.

39
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:03,960
Yes.

40
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,380
It used to base a bit less eloquent.

41
00:01:05,381 --> 00:01:05,860
Now it's,

42
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:06,693
but he,

43
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,670
he,

44
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:08,560
he's very convincing.

45
00:01:08,561 --> 00:01:12,280
He's very personable person and you can
easily get sucked into things like that.

46
00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:14,520
And then you start repeating
the same arguments yourself.

47
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,320
Yes.

48
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,830
And you're convincing yourself
because if you're an outgoing person,

49
00:01:17,831 --> 00:01:19,060
you're eloquent to yourself.

50
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,001
Well,

51
00:01:20,001 --> 00:01:24,590
it's also in being a smart person
and most of us are at least somewhat

52
00:01:24,591 --> 00:01:26,300
competitive that we want to be.

53
00:01:26,301 --> 00:01:26,930
Right.

54
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:29,750
And it's what you were talking about
earlier about certain skeptics being

55
00:01:29,751 --> 00:01:33,110
aggressive and they use
skepticism as a game.

56
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,720
It Chow tallying up a social score.

57
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:36,131
Yeah.

58
00:01:36,131 --> 00:01:40,090
I mean it becomes a debate in the old
fashioned sense of a debate where it's

59
00:01:40,091 --> 00:01:41,800
like one person has to argue this,

60
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:45,400
the other person argues the opposite
thing and then they fight it out and the

61
00:01:45,401 --> 00:01:46,480
best debater winds,

62
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:50,440
it becomes about debating rather than
about finding what is true and what is not

63
00:01:50,441 --> 00:01:51,274
true.

64
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:51,961
Yeah.

65
00:01:51,961 --> 00:01:52,321
That's,

66
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:55,680
that is a real problem with being able to,

67
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:00,270
to put it all aside and actually like
look at what the fuck is really going on.

68
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:06,630
They end up saying things that are wrong
because the too hasty to come up with

69
00:02:06,631 --> 00:02:07,800
an explanation for things.

70
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:08,860
So they'll end up like,

71
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:09,151
you know,

72
00:02:09,151 --> 00:02:09,740
just saying,

73
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:09,991
you know,

74
00:02:09,991 --> 00:02:10,410
oh that's,

75
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,100
that's not,

76
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,620
that's not a chem trail,

77
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:16,350
that's a smoke from the
planes just because it's the
first thing that comes into

78
00:02:16,351 --> 00:02:19,560
their head because the debunkers and
they think that if they can think of

79
00:02:19,561 --> 00:02:19,980
something,

80
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,740
they got that thing where they think they
are intelligent and they are somewhat

81
00:02:22,741 --> 00:02:23,550
intelligent,

82
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,340
but people fool themselves as to
how intelligent they actually are.

83
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:30,190
So even in debunkers can
you caught their own deceit?

84
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:30,970
Very.

85
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:33,820
It's very annoying from my perspective
as well because I get people coming onto

86
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:35,920
my site and then they
try to debunk things,

87
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:36,950
but they're,

88
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:37,200
they,

89
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,730
they say things that are
wrong scientifically wrong,

90
00:02:39,731 --> 00:02:42,250
and then you have to end up like
correcting the debunkers as well.

91
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,153
Will that ever ends?

92
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,020
Conti debunkers fully agree.

93
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,760
There are a lot of
content goes quite a few,

94
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:50,790
you know?

95
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:51,623
Sure.

96
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:52,520
It's easily today.

97
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:56,720
It's easy to be when you're
also frustrated with your
own vision of the world

98
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,100
and then when someone comes along
saying they have documented proof,

99
00:03:00,101 --> 00:03:03,650
the loch ness monster is real and you're
like the fuck you do shit shithead.

100
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,103
You don't.

101
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:05,740
It's hard.

102
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:06,401
It's hard to say,

103
00:03:06,401 --> 00:03:06,870
what is it,

104
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:07,240
sir?

105
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,630
What is this proof where way of
you've got this proofs toward me.

106
00:03:10,631 --> 00:03:15,631
I measure it stems from the evidence you
were asking for and the Ufo thing last

107
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:15,960
night,

108
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,650
was it?

109
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:18,310
Yeah.

110
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,330
They don't have evidence.

111
00:03:19,331 --> 00:03:21,820
They have windows tetanus testimony.

112
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:25,000
They had like crappy photo
has no empirical evidence.

113
00:03:25,001 --> 00:03:26,830
There's not that sort of like let's,

114
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:27,611
let's see.

115
00:03:27,611 --> 00:03:29,140
Some measurable evidence,

116
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:32,880
positive pregnancy tests in
high demand on craigslist.

117
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:33,723
I'll read it again.

118
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:34,900
How crazy is that shit?

119
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:36,610
Positive pregnancy.

120
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:37,150
Yes.

121
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,910
So like just to make
somebody marry you maybe.

122
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:40,933
Exactly.

123
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,100
They advertised tests for women hoping
to trick their boyfriends into popping

124
00:03:45,101 --> 00:03:45,934
the question.

125
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:46,943
Wow.

126
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:48,343
Whoa,

127
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:49,610
that's crazy.

128
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:54,340
They're only 25 bucks to 25 bucks.

129
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,870
Positive pregnancy test
25 bucks in Buffalo,

130
00:03:56,871 --> 00:03:57,291
New York.

131
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:58,124
Yes,

132
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,120
you saw that right?

133
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,900
I'm willing to selling
positive pregnancy tests.

134
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,520
Ever since I became pregnant,

135
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:07,520
I have been asked numerous
times for a positive test,

136
00:04:07,521 --> 00:04:09,350
so I decided to start charging for it.

137
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,400
Exclamation point.

138
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:13,640
I will take the test the same day.

139
00:04:13,641 --> 00:04:15,440
You want to pick it up?

140
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:19,430
I don't care what you use it for.

141
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,720
Not My business.

142
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:21,623
Wink.

143
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:22,920
Wow.

144
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,680
I'm always near my phone,

145
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,330
so just send an email.

146
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,063
Wow.

147
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,330
That's kind of crazy.

148
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,280
Some crazy pregnant bitch.

149
00:04:31,281 --> 00:04:32,960
Just pissing on chicks.

150
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,310
Pregnancy tests all day.

151
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,240
That's her business.

152
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,380
Twenty five bucks a pop.

153
00:04:38,381 --> 00:04:39,700
She's got a basket full of.

154
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:43,150
I'm just pissing on him like
crazy drinking giant jugs,

155
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:48,190
Koolaid pissing all over these things
and then like two days before the wedding

156
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:53,790
you fake a miscarriage and then everyone
buys you better toys and presence gives

157
00:04:53,981 --> 00:04:54,491
you more money.

158
00:04:54,491 --> 00:04:54,650
Say,

159
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:54,971
oh,

160
00:04:54,971 --> 00:04:56,050
that's so rude.

161
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,003
You're evil.

162
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,590
I don't even think most evil
woman could think that way.

163
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:01,421
Actually.

164
00:05:01,421 --> 00:05:03,250
They might right now my time at holy.

165
00:05:03,251 --> 00:05:04,084
Exactly right,

166
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:04,421
man.

167
00:05:04,421 --> 00:05:07,870
I had somebody do a fake
pregnancy with me once.

168
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,460
Remember that shit stupid.

169
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,410
Just so I would give her money.

170
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:13,061
Yeah,

171
00:05:13,061 --> 00:05:16,390
there's a lot of these
positive pregnancy tests,

172
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:20,770
things where they're advertising these
things and whether asking for them to

173
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,840
just kind of weird,

174
00:05:22,841 --> 00:05:23,674
man,

175
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,280
I would buy just to smell them.

176
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:30,981
How much is that?

177
00:05:30,981 --> 00:05:31,581
Twenty $5.

178
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:32,414
It's a smell.

179
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,360
20 five bucks just to smell
some random chicks pis.

180
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:39,620
If you're a real freak,

181
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,730
you might go for it.

182
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,540
I wonder if there's a.

183
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,330
You could sell that for 25 bucks here.

184
00:05:44,331 --> 00:05:45,530
Send me a rag and I'll pee on it.

185
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:51,110
I saw outside the realm of possibility.

186
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,690
It's crazy though.

187
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,070
Manipulation.

188
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,600
Just some like that's their,

189
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,730
their relationship is just
a constant battle like that.

190
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:09,400
So it's gotta be a weird way to enter
into a lifelong commitment for fake

191
00:06:09,401 --> 00:06:10,330
pregnancy test.

192
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:10,901
I mean,

193
00:06:10,901 --> 00:06:11,890
what if it all works out?

194
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,310
Happy you got married and one
day you're sitting around.

195
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:15,851
She goes,

196
00:06:15,851 --> 00:06:16,031
honey,

197
00:06:16,031 --> 00:06:17,290
I'm going to say something really funny.

198
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:19,450
Remember when I had that,

199
00:06:19,451 --> 00:06:20,284
uh,

200
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,250
that miscarriage,

201
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:22,840
I was never really pregnant.

202
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:23,980
I was fake.

203
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:24,730
I needed,

204
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:26,350
I knew you'd be happy eventually.

205
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,240
So look,

206
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,103
I was right.

207
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:31,690
Here we are 60 years later.

208
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:33,880
The guys like,

209
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,790
shit,

210
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,180
I don't care.

211
00:06:37,181 --> 00:06:37,421
Honey.

212
00:06:37,421 --> 00:06:38,320
I love you.

213
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,770
It's got to be the responsibility of
being the one who could possibly get

214
00:06:41,771 --> 00:06:42,251
pregnant.

215
00:06:42,251 --> 00:06:43,720
Boy does that fucking changed the game.

216
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:48,010
That's why they say that one
of the biggest changes in
behavior for human beings

217
00:06:48,011 --> 00:06:52,180
was when birth control was invented
because then for the first time women had

218
00:06:52,181 --> 00:06:57,181
some sort of control over their own
ability to get pregnant or get pregnant,

219
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,320
their own contraception.

220
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:00,690
They didn't have to count on,

221
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,690
I got to wear a rubber.

222
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,070
That guy doesn't want to wear a rubber.

223
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:06,160
Otherwise I got to get
like an Iud or diaphragm.

224
00:07:06,161 --> 00:07:07,540
Those things fucking slip out.

225
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,210
Especially if you have
a funder is tremendous.

226
00:07:10,211 --> 00:07:13,120
Waterfall of loads
slamming into that thing.

227
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,460
They can't take a good shot.

228
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:16,210
You know,

229
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:17,043
they're good,

230
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:18,730
they're good for like the average load,

231
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:22,150
but you get like a wilt chamberlain
load and they're just fine.

232
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,993
Swear around.

233
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:28,150
Flows that sucker sideways like one of
those big revolving doors and Indiana

234
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:28,840
Jones,

235
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,673
that's what it does.

236
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:32,530
The load headset and opens it up.

237
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:35,860
That was a big change
apparently for women.

238
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,460
So I'm asking,

239
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,521
Oh shit,

240
00:08:04,521 --> 00:08:08,030
itunes or recording to
server the fuck outta here.

241
00:08:08,031 --> 00:08:08,600
Server.
