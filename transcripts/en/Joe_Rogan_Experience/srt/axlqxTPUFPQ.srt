1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:02,440
The Joe Rogan experience,

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:07,840
but the beautiful thing about boxing is
that with everything wrong in the world,

3
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:15,020
and I hate to use this cliche,
this terminology,

4
00:00:15,021 --> 00:00:19,190
but you know we'd live being unfair
because I don't like to use that

5
00:00:19,191 --> 00:00:21,920
because.
Because sometimes people nowadays,

6
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,920
for me,
there's too many excuses out there.

7
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,320
There really are.
There's too many damn excuses.

8
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:30,560
You in this country,
you got a chance to do some where you

9
00:00:30,561 --> 00:00:35,300
don't have in other places,
but having said that,

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,790
he can feel like life's not fair
sometimes.

11
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:42,110
Supposedly when you think about some of
the things we just talked about in a day

12
00:00:42,111 --> 00:00:43,820
that's gone now,
it's not there no more,

13
00:00:43,821 --> 00:00:44,660
but.
Well,

14
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:49,670
Dave Lewis and all those kind of people.
Life wasn't fair that really they really

15
00:00:49,671 --> 00:00:54,470
had a right to use that say nowadays,
I don't think people have a white black,

16
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:57,560
purple.
They don't have a right to say that to

17
00:00:57,561 --> 00:00:59,720
the extent that they did back then.
Not to the extent.

18
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:00,230
No,
no,

19
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:02,640
they don't.
They really lose all the things wrong or

20
00:01:02,641 --> 00:01:04,160
they're messed up.
People still out there.

21
00:01:04,161 --> 00:01:05,050
Yeah,
yeah,

22
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:05,841
yeah,
yeah,

23
00:01:05,841 --> 00:01:09,920
yeah.
But sometimes it's too easy to use that.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,270
Yes.
It's just too easy.

25
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,740
I agree.
So.

26
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:16,490
But there was a time when life too often
was unfair.

27
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:18,620
Ruthlessly unfair.
Really unfair.

28
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,820
Were ruthlessly.
Yeah,

29
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,240
yeah,
yeah.

30
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:29,530
And when life was unfair,
boxing was around to make it fair.

31
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:34,200
And I'll tell you how
on one given night,

32
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:40,470
if you worked hard enough,
if you dream big enough,

33
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:44,840
if you were tough enough and you made
yourself tough enough,

34
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:50,390
you sacrificed enough,
it became polished and savvy enough and

35
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:57,470
and technically
equipped to do things that you had.

36
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:02,420
And you learn those things and you just
work yourself to the ball.

37
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:07,400
No matter where you came from,
no matter what part of the world,

38
00:02:07,401 --> 00:02:08,690
no matter what,
who your parents were,

39
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,180
no matter what your poverty level may
have been made,

40
00:02:11,181 --> 00:02:13,910
not a bit,
no matter what you had,

41
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,980
what you didn't have,
no matter what people had told you,

42
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:22,580
didn't tell you
all of that.

43
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:28,070
If you made yourself and took advantage
of that opportunity and get yourself

44
00:02:28,071 --> 00:02:33,071
ready,
you already to behave like a champion.

45
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You could get in that ring on one given
night and make the world fair and have

46
00:02:42,601 --> 00:02:47,601
your hand lifted view called champion of
the world that makes box and special

47
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:52,810
and it's also,
I think in some ways there's a leveling

48
00:02:52,811 --> 00:02:57,811
of the playing field that a lot of these
ideologies present to some people where

49
00:02:58,661 --> 00:02:59,770
they,
they go,

50
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,640
no,
you're not a freak.

51
00:03:00,641 --> 00:03:02,560
You're okay.
You know this.

52
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:07,300
There was some silly article on fat
acceptance the other day and it was

53
00:03:07,301 --> 00:03:10,210
talking and then they got some proposed,
which is fine.

54
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:13,520
Um,
I accept people who drink except I've

55
00:03:13,521 --> 00:03:15,880
accept all kinds of unhealthy choices,
but listen,

56
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:20,020
don't lie to me.
Just don't lie about the physical

57
00:03:20,021 --> 00:03:21,490
reality of what you've done to your
body.

58
00:03:21,491 --> 00:03:23,350
If you reach 400 pounds,
that's not,

59
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,360
that's not healthy.
You're saying it's healthy.

60
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,650
You're saying it's okay.
No,

61
00:03:26,651 --> 00:03:29,890
you're just not dead yet.
If you lost 200 pounds,

62
00:03:29,891 --> 00:03:32,740
you would feel wonderful.
That would be healthier.

63
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,110
Like if you smoke every day and you're
like,

64
00:03:35,111 --> 00:03:35,471
look,
no,

65
00:03:35,471 --> 00:03:36,910
cancer,
smoking is healthy.

66
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:37,481
No,
no,

67
00:03:37,481 --> 00:03:38,710
you just,
you just,

68
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,050
your body is dealing with it.

69
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:44,290
Your body's processing it.
It won't be able to forever.

70
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:48,220
That is exactly what's going on.
If you're morbidly obese and for you to

71
00:03:48,221 --> 00:03:53,221
pretend any differently and to just go
on about this fat acceptance movement

72
00:03:53,831 --> 00:03:57,280
and you know the big beautiful this and
that and like,

73
00:03:57,281 --> 00:03:58,570
no,
you're obese.

74
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:01,630
You've eaten too much food.
If you see a fat guy,

75
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,120
how come he doesn't get the same sort of
treatment?

76
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:07,180
Have you see a morbidly obese man and
his underwear?

77
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:11,920
No one's saying he's beautiful because
he's disgusting and he's fat and he's

78
00:04:11,921 --> 00:04:14,800
lazy and he's.
He's addicted to food.

79
00:04:14,801 --> 00:04:19,300
We all know it,
but if it's a woman were so inclined to

80
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:20,390
like accept just,
okay,

81
00:04:20,391 --> 00:04:22,060
I'll let her go.
She's fine.

82
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:24,070
You're wonderful.
You're beautiful.

83
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,850
You're amazing.
Like can give her her space.

84
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:32,851
We treat them as if they're incapable of
recognizing the absolute reality of

85
00:04:34,961 --> 00:04:37,900
their physical being.
I don't know how you feel about mumble

86
00:04:37,901 --> 00:04:40,330
rap,
but mumble rap is one of the weirdest

87
00:04:40,331 --> 00:04:40,530
things

88
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,363
to me.
It's.

89
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,140
I'm confused.
It's bizarre.

90
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,750
It's bizarre what is happening.
I just,

91
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:50,950
I feel like I feel like I don't want to
be that dude who doesn't get it right.

92
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,400
You know what I mean?
You don't get it.

93
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:57,960
I don't get it either I don't.
But when you start dealing with youth

94
00:04:57,961 --> 00:05:01,860
culture and when I was the age of these
mumble rap kids,

95
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:03,470
they were older heads saying,
yeah,

96
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,673
you know,
the,

97
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:09,270
the generation before roster,
the cold crush brothers to the big daddy

98
00:05:09,271 --> 00:05:10,650
kane.
So they probably thought what we were

99
00:05:10,651 --> 00:05:12,960
doing was crazy.
So is that what's happening?

100
00:05:12,961 --> 00:05:14,370
I don't know.
Maybe everyone's like,

101
00:05:14,371 --> 00:05:16,280
what the fuck is that?
It's like I,

102
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,720
it's to the point with me where I'm
like,

103
00:05:18,721 --> 00:05:20,490
Yo,
is that even a genre of rap?

104
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,350
Right?
Like I almost look at it.

105
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:25,530
I guess I don't,
I guess I don't have a problem with it

106
00:05:25,531 --> 00:05:28,890
because I don't process it as anything
close to what I do.

107
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,720
It's almost like if you said,
Yo,

108
00:05:30,721 --> 00:05:32,220
what are you think about Edm?
I'd be like,

109
00:05:32,221 --> 00:05:32,671
oh,
I don't know.

110
00:05:32,671 --> 00:05:33,650
August.
Is that right?

111
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,600
It's,
I don't even look at it like I can't

112
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:39,030
listen to that.
And then let him hear big daddy Kane and

113
00:05:39,031 --> 00:05:39,864
think it's the same thing.

114
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:41,940
Kids listening to music.
Right.

115
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:45,660
If you were listening to something that
you enjoyed,

116
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:49,320
one of the things you loved was good
lyrics of course,

117
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,330
and when you can understand what they're
saying.

118
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,900
Yeah.
And it's also,

119
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:56,530
it's just so driven by phrase driven.
Yeah.

120
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,820
They just,
whatever the and over and over and over

121
00:05:58,821 --> 00:05:59,541
again.
Yeah.

122
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:02,930
I don't know if it's just because these
kids are doing my alley or whatever and

123
00:06:02,931 --> 00:06:04,580
they're just in the zone.
Is it drug culture?

124
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:07,100
Because that's happened before Tuesday,
you know,

125
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:09,530
one thing creates the other,
it's like chicken or the egg.

126
00:06:09,531 --> 00:06:12,680
Are these kids doing molly and make
mumble rap or they don't mumble rap and

127
00:06:12,681 --> 00:06:15,220
they eat molly and it's all,
it's,

128
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,460
you know,
the sixties,

129
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:21,110
you going back to the fifties and
beatniks and that scene and jazz and

130
00:06:21,111 --> 00:06:23,990
heroin and w w what created it,
you know what I mean?

131
00:06:23,991 --> 00:06:26,960
That miles and Coltrane make some of
those records because they were on

132
00:06:26,961 --> 00:06:31,100
heroin or vice versa.
And it's happened historically.

133
00:06:31,101 --> 00:06:35,750
Is this just a drug driven culture?
I don't know because I'm detached,

134
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,590
you know,
I'm detaching that and I,

135
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,210
and you know,
I'm,

136
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,010
I'm a kid who grew up,
you know,

137
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,860
listening to metal and stuff like that.

138
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:43,760
So I,
I don't,

139
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,690
I'm not at a shortage for Oleson to
slayer.

140
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:49,010
I'll just listen to slayer before I
listened to that.

141
00:06:49,011 --> 00:06:51,590
If that's my only option,
then I'll listen to slayer.

142
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:53,990
You know what I mean?
I listened to black flag,

143
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:57,060
I listen to minor threat.
That's what I'll do,

144
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,530
you know?
So

145
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:02,750
whether I,
however I feel about it becomes

146
00:07:02,751 --> 00:07:07,751
irrelevant when you realize that you
have so much good shit out there.

147
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,730
So I don't need.
It's like with film,

148
00:07:10,731 --> 00:07:13,590
like I'm not worried about a bad movie.
I just watched the dope movie.

149
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:16,790
There's so many movies thrown them away.
Right.

150
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:18,860
And it's like,
Yo,

151
00:07:18,861 --> 00:07:23,861
I was just listening to thin lizzy if I,
if I don't feel like adjusting to that,

152
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:26,660
you know what I mean?
And there's other things that we might

153
00:07:26,661 --> 00:07:28,570
not get because we're not doing what we
used to do.

154
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,300
Maybe I was a bar of the clubs five
nights a week and you weren't married

155
00:07:32,301 --> 00:07:35,060
with kids and we were hammered maybe a
challenge,

156
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:37,650
different time and place yet

157
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,670
because,
uh,

158
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:42,360
I am baffled by this carnivore diet.
Yes.

159
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:46,280
And baffled.
I'm baffled by how many people are

160
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:51,750
cleaning to it as a panacea.
I'm baffled by whether or not it's a

161
00:07:51,751 --> 00:07:56,040
physiological effect or whether there's
a placebo effect going on.

162
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,820
I have a theory please.
Yeah.

163
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:58,730
So

164
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:02,090
my theory is that it mimics some of the
benefits of fasting,

165
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,810
um,
but allows people to persist for longer

166
00:08:05,811 --> 00:08:08,400
because it's providing some nutrition.
You know,

167
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,310
most,
if you look in the scientific

168
00:08:10,311 --> 00:08:13,220
literature,
fasting is the cure all for everything.

169
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:16,640
I mean,
like you can look at any condition and

170
00:08:16,641 --> 00:08:18,770
fasting is the cure time,
water fasting.

171
00:08:18,771 --> 00:08:20,270
So you can do it for two,
three,

172
00:08:20,271 --> 00:08:22,520
four weeks from his,
tried that for a year.

173
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:25,760
That will be the cure for life in that
case.

174
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,570
The longest example is a year of
Waterford.

175
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,760
So most people are not at that last,
uh,

176
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:36,430
it was,
he was extremely obese of energy stores

177
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,200
this fat stores.
Right?

178
00:08:38,201 --> 00:08:41,960
So that's one thing about that was that
he actually his skin trank to right,

179
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:42,920
which is really,
yeah.

180
00:08:42,921 --> 00:08:44,750
Which doesn't usually happen with weight
loss.

181
00:08:44,751 --> 00:08:47,090
So this is just a theory.
I have nothing to.

182
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,650
No,
I don't have any evidence,

183
00:08:48,651 --> 00:08:52,520
but we meet as absorbed very high up in
the digestive tract.

184
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:57,150
And so when you only eat,
it's a low residue diet and there's

185
00:08:57,151 --> 00:09:00,650
nothing leftover to irritate or inflame
the gut.

186
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:03,570
My theory is a lot of people who are
benefiting from this have really

187
00:09:03,571 --> 00:09:07,920
disrupted gut microbiome.
Alessio Fasano has argued that leaky gut

188
00:09:07,921 --> 00:09:10,950
is kind of a preconditioned for
autoimmunity and this,

189
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:13,860
the carnivore diet is,
it's essentially like a gut rast or a

190
00:09:13,861 --> 00:09:18,450
fast.
And so I don't doubt that people are

191
00:09:18,451 --> 00:09:21,430
benefiting from it.
The question is what is the long term

192
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:22,503
implication?

193
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,520
Yeah,
I mean I,

194
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:26,760
I'm not anti Quito,
I'm not anti Vegan.

195
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:30,960
I'm anti bullshit.
And one of the problems we have is

196
00:09:30,961 --> 00:09:33,360
nutrition is replacing religion for a
lot of people.

197
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:38,780
So you find something that you identify
with and then people start to try to say

198
00:09:40,231 --> 00:09:43,260
because they identify with that movement
or like for example,

199
00:09:43,261 --> 00:09:45,690
vegans,
they identify with many of them,

200
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,130
uh,
protection of animals,

201
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:49,860
not my job to judge their ethics and
that sort of thing,

202
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:54,150
but then they kind of try to backtrack
to find the science to support them as

203
00:09:54,151 --> 00:09:56,670
well and they,
they pick and choose.

204
00:09:56,671 --> 00:09:58,440
And this is guilty of all groups,
not just vegans.

205
00:09:58,441 --> 00:10:00,870
This is also a lot of key digital diet
cell.

206
00:10:00,871 --> 00:10:03,930
It's a carnivore diet,
whatever have you.

207
00:10:03,931 --> 00:10:07,590
If it has the word diet,
they're zealots out there who are going

208
00:10:07,591 --> 00:10:10,200
after it.
And I will stick up for.

209
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:13,170
I've stuck up at a scientific conference
for the Ketogenic Diet.

210
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,353
Uh,
you were,

211
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:18,000
we were having a round table about
something different and somebody said,

212
00:10:18,001 --> 00:10:19,700
well,
we know that the key to genic diet in

213
00:10:19,701 --> 00:10:21,630
prayers,
exercise performance and endurance

214
00:10:21,631 --> 00:10:22,351
athletes.
And I said,

215
00:10:22,351 --> 00:10:25,200
I don't think that's necessarily true.
Uh,

216
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:25,920
you know,
the,

217
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,550
the,
it's pretty ambivalent or ambiguous as

218
00:10:29,551 --> 00:10:32,040
to whether or not it does.
It seems to be kind of individual.

219
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,420
Um,
but on the whole,

220
00:10:33,421 --> 00:10:35,520
on the average,
it doesn't seem to impair exercise

221
00:10:35,521 --> 00:10:37,590
performance,
so it's kind of what you like,

222
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:40,220
but when you have people who you know,
like,

223
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,490
like a Gary Taubes,
who says,

224
00:10:41,491 --> 00:10:42,810
well,
calories don't matter,

225
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:46,290
it's all carbohydrates,
that sort of thing,

226
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:48,240
or the carbohydrate,
insulin model of obesity.

227
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,600
I mean,
the research is you're able to do a lot

228
00:10:51,601 --> 00:10:54,570
of hand waving about insulin and you
know,

229
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:57,240
where you burn so much fat when you're
on a high fat diet,

230
00:10:57,241 --> 00:10:59,340
which is true by the way you,
you burn a lot of fat,

231
00:10:59,341 --> 00:11:01,050
but what they don't talk about is that
it's,

232
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:06,240
it's overall fat balance,
how much fat you store versus how much

233
00:11:06,241 --> 00:11:07,074
fat you burn.

234
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:09,900
And when you're on a high fat diet,
you store a lot of fat,

235
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,990
you also burn a lot of fat.
The overall caloric balance is what

236
00:11:12,991 --> 00:11:16,740
determines whether or not you will have
net storage or net deposition.

237
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,870
This same thing for high carb diet as
well.

238
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:22,650
You know,
this idea that with high insulin it just

239
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:24,630
completely shuts down all fat burning
everywhere.

240
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,490
That's just not true.
Now,

241
00:11:26,491 --> 00:11:28,800
if you have high carbohydrate,
you will burn less fat,

242
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,230
but you're also storing less fat as
well.

243
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:34,380
And again,
the net caloric balance is going to be

244
00:11:34,381 --> 00:11:38,790
what determines how much you store
because you don't really store

245
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:40,980
carbohydrates as fat.
For most people.

246
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,180
They did a study,
a overfeeding women where they overfed

247
00:11:45,181 --> 00:11:49,140
them 50 percent above their caloric
maintenance and they found that of 282

248
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:51,630
grams of fat that they stored during the
day and adipose.

249
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:55,800
Only four grams came from carbohydrate.
Two hundred and 78 came from fat.
