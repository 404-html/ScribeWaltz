1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:04,030
The joe rogan experience,
how did it humble you?

2
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:07,150
Like in what way?
Because I realized that

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,070
when we were,
let's say when I'm,

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,110
when I film a documentary and I'm
[inaudible],

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,480
uh,
I from a documentary called [inaudible]

6
00:00:16,481 --> 00:00:20,040
Negra and um,
and Cape Verde two years ago.

7
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:21,630
Aqua Negro.
Yeah.

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,510
Iguana.
Does that mean black water?

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,753
Yes,
in Portuguese.

10
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:28,510
And then,
uh,

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,690
we were there for about five weeks,
five or six weeks.

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,700
And then the living conditions were
pretty bad

13
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,960
and there was no grocery stores around
and we had to catch my own food.

14
00:00:37,961 --> 00:00:40,530
And then it was really a self sufficient
type of chip.

15
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:44,400
In the first week.
I remember the only thing I could focus

16
00:00:44,401 --> 00:00:46,020
on was,
oh God,

17
00:00:46,021 --> 00:00:48,360
this is,
this is terrible.

18
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:51,300
The,
we don't have a showered is no hot

19
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:53,640
water,
bathroom are disgusting,

20
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,540
I'm starving is nothing around.
And then all you can thing is like,

21
00:00:57,541 --> 00:01:00,630
how will you comfort is gone.
And after week,

22
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,930
that's the,

23
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:09,510
the focus change on the good things that
we're seeing around us and why having

24
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:12,280
nothing all of a sudden then I was like,
oh,

25
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:17,370
I actually now for the first time in my
life can take the time to realize what's

26
00:01:17,801 --> 00:01:22,660
good around me and then how we were
having fires with the neighbors and then

27
00:01:22,661 --> 00:01:24,970
how we were offering and fish and we
were thinking,

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,361
oh,
you know,

29
00:01:25,361 --> 00:01:28,480
if I give this guy two fish is going to
eat one today and one tomorrow.

30
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:31,750
But no,
the inviting the neighbors to share when

31
00:01:31,751 --> 00:01:34,540
they made sure that it was like a whole
like community sentence to all of it.

32
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,160
And I was like,
wow,

33
00:01:36,161 --> 00:01:37,630
I've been living in London for six
years.

34
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:39,130
I don't even know the name of my
neighbor.

35
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:41,181
And it's,
it's,

36
00:01:41,181 --> 00:01:41,951
it's,
it's bad.

37
00:01:41,951 --> 00:01:43,990
It's not,
it's not a way of living that I want.

38
00:01:43,991 --> 00:01:45,970
It's not focusing in the right thing is,
and it's,

39
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,060
it was that,
that that's in that way,

40
00:01:49,061 --> 00:01:50,440
you know,
it's realize how much of,

41
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:55,720
how much of an asshole we actually
became and I just didn't want to do

42
00:01:55,721 --> 00:01:56,554
that.

43
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:00,760
The moment the cameras went off,
Masa waukee twisted a spoon and started

44
00:02:00,761 --> 00:02:04,900
getting it to twist.
The producer had a complete mental

45
00:02:04,901 --> 00:02:05,531
breakdown.
Now,

46
00:02:05,531 --> 00:02:06,610
up to this point,
I'm just thinking,

47
00:02:06,611 --> 00:02:07,450
this is tricks,
right?

48
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,490
It's not,
it's not that big of a deal.

49
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:14,290
He starts screaming,
yelling that randy's evil should never

50
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:16,360
have listened to randy.
He would've got this on tape if it

51
00:02:16,361 --> 00:02:19,600
wasn't for Randy.
And he looks down and he's got a wet

52
00:02:19,601 --> 00:02:22,540
spot on the front of his pants and he
looks down and he says,

53
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:26,080
I just had a demonic ejaculations like
literally,

54
00:02:26,081 --> 00:02:30,880
and he's having his mental breakdown.
I go and I have to spend the night,

55
00:02:30,881 --> 00:02:35,170
which was not a bad thing.
She was quite pleasant to look at his,

56
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:37,960
his assistant.
I had to spend the night with her in her

57
00:02:37,961 --> 00:02:40,360
room because randy was calling her.
I'm not randy.

58
00:02:40,361 --> 00:02:41,194
I mean,
uh,

59
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,150
uh,
Tony editable calling or the producer

60
00:02:43,151 --> 00:02:48,151
was calling her consistently screaming
and yelling about randy and the skin the

61
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:49,240
fuck up.

62
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,170
You can't just gloss over the fact that
guy just nutted in his pants.

63
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,600
He was yelling,
you're just gonna.

64
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,450
He had a med.
It's a mental breakdown.

65
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,760
I mean,
it's like a hot orgasm and your pants

66
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:59,530
during a mental note.
I didn't it.

67
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,180
He did it.
They should document that.

68
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,830
That's more impressive than banging a
spoon.

69
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,820
I should have said.
Yep.

70
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,740
That's my psychic ability working right
there.

71
00:03:05,741 --> 00:03:07,690
I mean,
that doesn't make any sense.

72
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,140
So he,
he tells you he has an a jackie in his

73
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:12,610
pants.
He in front of everybody,

74
00:03:12,611 --> 00:03:15,790
he says it's a demonic ejaculation.
He straight up says,

75
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:19,190
I am the Arctic ejaculations.
Seems like a together guy with

76
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:21,940
definitely got a head on his shoulders.
He was a producer for us.

77
00:03:21,941 --> 00:03:23,970
I think it was BBC,
if I'm not mistaken.

78
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,750
He was doing a documentary for them,
so yeah.

79
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,310
Well he's fucking crazy,
huh?

80
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,130
He finished a documentary,
so,

81
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,023
oh well,
yeah,

82
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,320
definitely.
It wasn't crazy then.

83
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:35,020
As long as you finish this documentary.
Well,

84
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:38,710
he believed in psychic phenomena.
He also believed the demon made him come

85
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:39,790
in his pants.
That is true.

86
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,450
How are we going to do this calorie?
What are we going to do?

87
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,830
We filled our BC up.
When I run out of air,

88
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,950
I'm now thinking in my mind,
how am I going to die,

89
00:03:49,951 --> 00:03:51,270
Joe?
Right?

90
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,060
Tell my wife,
tell my kid I'm not fucking,

91
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,150
I'm coming home now.
I got to fucking realize how am I going

92
00:03:57,151 --> 00:03:59,610
to die?
I have a notepad that you carry in your

93
00:03:59,611 --> 00:04:01,350
pocket to draw and write on.
I'm thinking,

94
00:04:01,351 --> 00:04:02,220
what?
What?

95
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,080
What are you going to say?
What's your,

96
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,870
what's your letter going to be?
You're writing a fucking death later.

97
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:08,220
You're awake.
You're a fighter.

98
00:04:08,221 --> 00:04:11,760
We figured this out.
They don't fucking find a way to Kuwait.

99
00:04:11,761 --> 00:04:13,260
You fucking bitch.
He's a conversation.

100
00:04:13,261 --> 00:04:14,094
I'm having one.
And I said,

101
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:15,690
well,
I'm in fucking complete panic morning,

102
00:04:15,691 --> 00:04:17,460
complete darkness thinking that there's
no,

103
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:20,460
this is how people die.
What the fuck are you doing?

104
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:23,490
You're going to write a letter to your
fucking kid and tell her how you,

105
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:24,930
how you fucked up.
I'm sorry.

106
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:29,931
Daddy's not coming home.
So I'm fucking thinking I'm not going to

107
00:04:30,151 --> 00:04:31,590
drown.
They're not going to breathe my last

108
00:04:31,591 --> 00:04:33,540
breath.
So I'm going to breed this BC that just

109
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:37,140
fill up with air and I'm a fucking
breathe it until the oxygen level no

110
00:04:37,141 --> 00:04:38,760
longer happens and I'd just pass out.
That's,

111
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,010
that's my,
that's what I've come to realize how I'm

112
00:04:41,011 --> 00:04:43,500
going to die.
I'm going to fucking just slip away and

113
00:04:43,501 --> 00:04:46,170
pass out,
keep breathing the same air until

114
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:51,300
I go away and I start thinking,
you fucking piece of shit.

115
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:54,030
You're,
you're giving up.

116
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:57,600
You're having the legitimate
conversations with myself while fucking

117
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,950
a complete panic.
Like you're,

118
00:04:58,951 --> 00:05:01,340
you're going to quit that.
You're writing a letter and you're gonna

119
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:04,650
fucking breathe your last air until you
pass out you fucking pussy.

120
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,690
You're a fighter.
Figured the fuck out.

121
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,070
So I'm upside down.
I'm crawling on the ceiling.

122
00:05:11,071 --> 00:05:15,090
I remember when I came in,
we came in the big cave and there's like

123
00:05:15,091 --> 00:05:18,780
a huge fucking crack that runs along the
top turn.

124
00:05:18,781 --> 00:05:21,260
Both my watch off now at this point,
because they're giving off light and I

125
00:05:21,261 --> 00:05:24,210
kill my light.
And I said that crack in a fucking lead

126
00:05:24,211 --> 00:05:26,310
to the surface.
That cracks going to fucking give us

127
00:05:26,311 --> 00:05:27,480
something.
So I just call,

128
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:31,140
start panicking.
Me Panicking Leni again because I'm

129
00:05:31,141 --> 00:05:32,640
panicking.
I don't know what to do.

130
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:36,660
I'm sucking air and a fucking breathing
hard and I'm hyperventilating and crying

131
00:05:36,661 --> 00:05:38,220
on the ceiling,
crying on the ceiling,

132
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,170
looking for this fucking cracking.
God Damn it.

133
00:05:40,171 --> 00:05:43,620
I found it.
I found the crack and I followed the

134
00:05:43,621 --> 00:05:46,830
crack and the crack got bigger and all
of a sudden I see fucking glow,

135
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,890
like green glow,
crawl and crawl on.

136
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,240
Find it.
Try to get up.

137
00:05:51,241 --> 00:05:53,190
My tags are too big.
I can't fucking get out of the little

138
00:05:53,191 --> 00:05:55,350
hole.
Can't get out of the hole.

139
00:05:55,351 --> 00:05:57,710
I'm fucking big.
Be Big,

140
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:00,620
big fucking hitting,
screaming,

141
00:06:00,621 --> 00:06:02,150
freaking out.
Calm down.

142
00:06:02,151 --> 00:06:03,020
Cowboy.
Calm down,

143
00:06:03,021 --> 00:06:04,160
Kelly.
This is the way.

144
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,110
Calm the fuck down.
Reel it in.

145
00:06:06,111 --> 00:06:07,430
Reel it in.
We're here.

146
00:06:07,431 --> 00:06:10,940
We made it
grab control.

147
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,020
Fall the cracks and more opens up out.
Boom.

148
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:18,470
There's theK fucking I'm out
made it.

149
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,440
You're coming home.
You are doug about.

150
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:22,483
Wow.

151
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:28,940
That was the feeling.
Meanwhile,

152
00:06:28,941 --> 00:06:31,970
my guys out there,
I can't be mad at him because he

153
00:06:31,971 --> 00:06:33,170
panicked.
He grabbed line.

154
00:06:33,171 --> 00:06:38,171
He fucking ran out the hole.
He looks at me and he says,

155
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:40,893
MMM,

156
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,460
so we're not diving together ever again,
Ali.

157
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,340
I said,
no,

158
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,320
that was it.
That was it.

159
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:52,660
And I texted my girl,
I love you baby.

160
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,440
And uh,
they was fucking scary moment,

161
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,120
but daddy's coming home.

162
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,800
What is it like to have Jordan Peterson
has a dad.

163
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,210
Is it weird?
Do you have to check yourself

164
00:07:02,211 --> 00:07:03,560
constantly?
Make sure you're on,

165
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:07,490
on steady ground?
And I'd say anything ridiculous.

166
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,690
No,
not at all.

167
00:07:08,691 --> 00:07:11,030
None at all.
I didn't realize it was weird until I

168
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:16,031
went away to university and then kind of
saw like just when I was away for a

169
00:07:16,111 --> 00:07:18,320
while and then when I came back to the
house,

170
00:07:18,321 --> 00:07:21,920
especially because the house was full of
like paintings and masks and statues and

171
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,800
like 32 different paint colors and they
came back and was like,

172
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:27,170
oh,
maybe he's a bit eccentric.

173
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,740
No,
he's definitely eccentric.

174
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,190
Um,
we were talking off air about what it

175
00:07:34,191 --> 00:07:36,590
was like to watch your dad to become
famous and,

176
00:07:36,591 --> 00:07:39,500
and become famous.
And in his 50s,

177
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:40,334
right?
Like,

178
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:43,190
yeah,
I hope 54 55 that's when he became

179
00:07:43,191 --> 00:07:46,340
famous before that.
Relatively unknown,

180
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:50,390
respected professor.
One issue with this one transgender

181
00:07:50,391 --> 00:07:51,700
bill,
the,

182
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:55,280
the preferred pronouns bill,
and then boom,

183
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,590
off to the races.
Yeah,

184
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:59,540
it's strange.
It was,

185
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:01,520
yeah,
it was super weird,

186
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:05,720
especially how the media was portraying
him and how what was actually happening

187
00:08:05,721 --> 00:08:08,480
at the events wasn't what was being
portrayed in the media.

188
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,630
So that was weird to watch.
And then people recognizing him on the

189
00:08:11,631 --> 00:08:13,040
street is strange.
It's,

190
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:15,500
yes.
When you say what,

191
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,680
what happened in real life was not,
was what was being portrayed like what

192
00:08:18,681 --> 00:08:20,900
was different?
Um,

193
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:24,260
mostly what he was saying.
So most of what he said is on film

194
00:08:24,261 --> 00:08:25,094
anyway.

195
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:27,590
So you can go to youtube and see what
he's been saying.

196
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:30,200
Like not,
there's not like some secret that's

197
00:08:30,201 --> 00:08:33,830
going around,
but what's been portrayed has been so

198
00:08:33,831 --> 00:08:35,630
much more negative than what he's
actually said.

199
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:40,520
Or they'll take like sound bites and
just weave a story that isn't quite

200
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:42,410
true.
Which I didn't read it for some reason.

201
00:08:42,411 --> 00:08:45,710
I now it looks silly,
but for some reason I just thought that

202
00:08:45,711 --> 00:08:48,440
what the media was portraying was honest
always.

203
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,000
Yeah.
Yeah,

204
00:08:50,001 --> 00:08:51,080
me too.
Yeah.

205
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,490
Yeah.
And it's not,

206
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:55,010
they're trapped in there and they can't.
Right get out.

207
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,040
They,
they didn't have an

208
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,780
option to say,
I don't want to see him.

209
00:08:57,781 --> 00:08:59,910
It's really interesting.
All the different spins though.

210
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,760
All the different women spins,
you know?

211
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:06,540
And W one,
one really bizarre spin that I saw was

212
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:10,350
this one was saying that this is
indicative of the problem of all comedy

213
00:09:10,351 --> 00:09:15,351
clubs and aggressive male audience and
women sitting there feeling threatened,

214
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:19,020
not being able to use their voice.
I'm like user voice.

215
00:09:19,021 --> 00:09:20,140
Like what are you gonna heckle?
Oh yeah.

216
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,680
They were saying like,
like you would be more empowered if

217
00:09:22,681 --> 00:09:25,440
there were more women.
So you could heckle is,

218
00:09:25,441 --> 00:09:27,810
that's not cool.
Like you're not supposed to do that at a

219
00:09:27,811 --> 00:09:31,500
comedy club have you don't like someone
just don't laugh,

220
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,210
you know?
Right.

221
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:33,950
But like,
I mean this one was,

222
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,560
here's the thing,
it's not your job or it's not your place

223
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:41,190
to say that you don't like someone when
the other people do like it.

224
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:42,770
You know,
if you were right,

225
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,400
if you're going to get,
I'm going to walk out.

226
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,200
Yeah.
Just like you're going to see a movie,

227
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,950
like you're an audience member.
The deal is you're not there to perform.

228
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:54,000
The audience is there to just sit there
and laugh or not laugh,

229
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,980
right?
But don't be rude to the other people

230
00:09:55,981 --> 00:09:58,290
that are enjoying it.
So as soon as you break your

231
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:00,750
sensibilities above the rest of the
audience,

232
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:01,950
well,
you are a problem,

233
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:02,910
right?
You've made,

234
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,290
if you decide like,
hey,

235
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:05,970
I didn't like this,
I'm going to go home and write about it.

236
00:10:05,971 --> 00:10:07,650
That's totally your prerogative.
That's fine.

237
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,700
Get up and walk out.
Yeah,

238
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,050
that's fine.
Go somewhere else and talk about it on

239
00:10:11,051 --> 00:10:12,260
stage yourself.
Yeah.

240
00:10:12,261 --> 00:10:13,830
No,
nothing wrong with any of those things.

241
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:14,640
Yeah.
But this,

242
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,640
this one woman's take was like,
women don't feel like they have,

243
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,570
uh,
they can,

244
00:10:18,571 --> 00:10:21,690
they have the ability to speak out about
it.

245
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,620
I'm like,
speak out.

246
00:10:22,621 --> 00:10:24,000
Like,
so you're saying like to heckle,

247
00:10:24,001 --> 00:10:25,650
Hey,
I don't want you on stage.

248
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:29,070
I know everything about you and your
story.

249
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:31,980
I talk to me.
I want you to perform in front of me.

250
00:10:31,981 --> 00:10:33,810
Even those other people are laughing.
Right?

251
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,930
And th th that these aggressive men were
yelling,

252
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,280
good to see you back.
Louie.

253
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,210
Aggressive men.
Like,

254
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,180
okay.
That's like,

255
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:45,510
there's a framing of this and this is
one of its,

256
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:50,511
becomes this male versus female framing
that sort of represents aggressive men,

257
00:10:51,091 --> 00:10:53,580
sexual men doing things to women.
They don't want,

258
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,150
the women are sitting there in silence.
They don't want to be there and they

259
00:10:57,151 --> 00:11:01,170
don't have a voice because they feel
overwhelmed and out overpopulated or,

260
00:11:01,171 --> 00:11:02,040
uh,
eh.

261
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:02,903
Outnumbered.

262
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:10,663
Okay.

263
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:12,360
Okay.
