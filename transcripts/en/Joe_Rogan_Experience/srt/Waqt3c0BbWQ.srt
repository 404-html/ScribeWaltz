1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:04,030
Rogan experience,
how did it humble you?

2
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:07,150
Like in what way?
Because I realized that

3
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:10,720
when we were.
Let's see when,

4
00:00:10,721 --> 00:00:13,990
when I'm,
when I film a documentary and I'm soften

5
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:16,470
men,
I film a documentary called when they

6
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:20,040
grow in.
I'm in Cape Verde two years ago.

7
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:21,730
Negro?
Yeah.

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,250
Iguana.
Does that mean black water events in

9
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,920
Portuguese and then we were there for
about five weeks,

10
00:00:29,921 --> 00:00:32,700
five or six weeks and then the living
conditions were really bad

11
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,220
and there was no grocery stores around
and we had to catch my own food and it

12
00:00:38,221 --> 00:00:40,530
was really a self sufficient type of
chip.

13
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:45,150
In the first week I remember the only
thing I could focus on was,

14
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,560
oh God,
this is.

15
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:50,670
This is terrible.
The we don't have a shower.

16
00:00:50,671 --> 00:00:53,610
There's no hot water and bathrooms are
disgusting.

17
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,770
I'm starving is nothing around.
And then all you can thing is like how

18
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:02,790
you comfort is gone and after a week
that's the.

19
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:09,510
The focus changed on the good things I
we're seeing around us and why having

20
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:12,280
nothing all of a sudden then I was like,
oh,

21
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,360
I actually now for the first time in my
life can take the time to realize what's

22
00:01:17,801 --> 00:01:22,660
good around me and then how we were
having fires with the neighbors and then

23
00:01:22,661 --> 00:01:24,930
how we were offering and fish and we
were like,

24
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:25,361
oh,
you know,

25
00:01:25,361 --> 00:01:28,450
if I give this guy to fish is going to
eat one today and then one tomorrow.

26
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,750
But no,
the inviting neighbors to share when

27
00:01:31,751 --> 00:01:35,560
they make sure that it was like a whole,
like community sends to all of it and I

28
00:01:35,561 --> 00:01:36,161
was like,
wow,

29
00:01:36,161 --> 00:01:37,630
I've been living in London for six
years.

30
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:39,160
I don't even know the name of the
neighbor.

31
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:41,201
And it's,
it's,

32
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:41,951
it's,
it's bad.

33
00:01:41,951 --> 00:01:43,990
It's just not a way of living that I
want.

34
00:01:43,991 --> 00:01:45,970
It's not focusing in a right thing is.
And it's,

35
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,060
it was that,
that's in that way,

36
00:01:49,061 --> 00:01:52,930
you know,
it's realized how much of how much of an

37
00:01:52,931 --> 00:01:55,870
asshole we actually became and I just
didn't want to do that.

38
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:00,450
The moment the cameras went off,
muscle walkie twists that a spoon and

39
00:02:00,451 --> 00:02:04,900
started getting it to twist.
The producer had a complete mental

40
00:02:04,901 --> 00:02:05,531
breakdown.
Now,

41
00:02:05,531 --> 00:02:07,210
up to this point,
I'm just thinking this is tricks,

42
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:07,990
right?
It's not,

43
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:11,620
it's not that big of a deal.
He starts screaming,

44
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,690
yelling that rain,
he's evil,

45
00:02:13,691 --> 00:02:16,150
should never have listened to randy.
He woulda got this on tape.

46
00:02:16,151 --> 00:02:20,590
If it wasn't for Randy and he looks down
and he's got a wet spot on the front of

47
00:02:20,591 --> 00:02:24,730
his pants and he looks down and he says,
I just had a demonic ejaculation,

48
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,490
like literally,
and he's having a mental breakdown.

49
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:31,900
I go and I have to spend the night,
which was not a bad thing.

50
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:34,090
She was quite pleasant,
um,

51
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,070
to look at his,
his assistant.

52
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:39,700
I had to spend the night with her in her
room because randy was calling her.

53
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:40,360
I'm not randy.

54
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,193
I mean,
uh,

55
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:42,730
uh,
Tony editable calling her.

56
00:02:42,731 --> 00:02:46,750
The producer was calling her
consistently screaming and yelling about

57
00:02:46,751 --> 00:02:50,830
randy and this scared the fuck up.
You can't just gloss over the fact that

58
00:02:50,831 --> 00:02:52,960
guy just noted in his pants and he was
yelling,

59
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,400
you're just to.
He had a mental.

60
00:02:54,401 --> 00:02:58,360
It's a mental breakdown.
Orgasm in your pants during a mental

61
00:02:58,361 --> 00:02:59,530
breakdown.
I didn't it.

62
00:02:59,531 --> 00:03:01,180
He did it.
You should document that.

63
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,830
That's more impressive than spending a
spoon.

64
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,820
I should've said,
yeah,

65
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,740
that's my psychic ability working right
there.

66
00:03:05,741 --> 00:03:07,690
I mean,
that doesn't make any sense.

67
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:10,900
So he,
he tells you this as an ejaculation

68
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,610
pants.
He in front of everybody.

69
00:03:12,611 --> 00:03:16,590
He says it's a demonic ejaculation.
East straight up says I.

70
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:20,200
The Arctic ejaculation seems like a
together guy with definitely got a head

71
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:21,930
on his shoulders.
He was a producer for,

72
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:23,980
I think it was BBC,
if I'm not mistaken.

73
00:03:23,981 --> 00:03:25,750
He was doing a documentary for them,
so yeah.

74
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:26,950
Well,
he's fucking crazy.

75
00:03:26,951 --> 00:03:28,770
Huh?
He finished.

76
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,130
He finished a documentary,
so.

77
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:30,770
Oh,
well.

78
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:31,480
Yeah,
definitely.

79
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,680
It wasn't crazy though.
As long as he finished.

80
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,950
He.
Well,

81
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:38,500
he believed in psychic phenomena.
He also believed that a demon made them

82
00:03:38,501 --> 00:03:39,790
come in his pants.
That is true.

83
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,820
How are we going to do this?
Cowboy?

84
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:46,821
What are we going to do short RBC up?
When I run out of air,

85
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,970
I'm now thinking in my mind,
how am I going to die?

86
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,300
Gel,
right?

87
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,090
Tell my wife telling my kid I'm not
fucking.

88
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,150
I'm coming home now.
I got to fucking realize how am I going

89
00:03:57,151 --> 00:03:59,610
to die.
I have a notepad that you carry in your

90
00:03:59,611 --> 00:04:01,350
pocket to draw and write on.
I'm thinking,

91
00:04:01,351 --> 00:04:02,184
what?
What?

92
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,080
What are you going to say?
What's your.

93
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,870
What's your letter going to be?
Your writing fucking death later.

94
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:08,250
You're awake.
You're a fighter.

95
00:04:08,251 --> 00:04:11,760
We figure this out.
Don't fucking find a way to quit.

96
00:04:11,761 --> 00:04:14,610
You fucking bitches the conversation.
I'm having one result while I'm in

97
00:04:14,611 --> 00:04:17,430
fucking complete panic mode in complete
darkness thinking that there's no.

98
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:20,460
This is how people die.
What the fuck are you doing?

99
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,460
You're going to write a letter to your
fucking kid and tell her how you.

100
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,960
How you fucked up.
I'm sorry.

101
00:04:24,961 --> 00:04:29,370
Daddy's not coming home.
So I'm fucking thinking.

102
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,070
I'm not going to drown.
I'm not going to breathe my last breath,

103
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:35,070
so I'm going to breathe this BC that
just fill up with air and I'm a fucking

104
00:04:35,071 --> 00:04:37,720
breathe it until the oxygen level no
longer happens.

105
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:38,790
I just pass out.
That's,

106
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,920
that's my.
That's where I've come to realize how

107
00:04:40,921 --> 00:04:43,500
I'm going to die.
I'm going to fucking just slip away and

108
00:04:43,501 --> 00:04:46,140
pass out.
Keep breathing the same air until

109
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:51,300
I go away and I started thinking,
you fucking piece of shit.

110
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:56,460
You're giving up like the year having
legitimate conversations with myself

111
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,960
while fucking complete panic.
Like you're,

112
00:04:58,961 --> 00:05:01,350
you're going to quit that.
You're writing a letter and you're gonna

113
00:05:01,351 --> 00:05:03,810
fucking breathe your last leg.
You pass out,

114
00:05:03,811 --> 00:05:05,250
you fucking pussy.
You're a fighter.

115
00:05:05,251 --> 00:05:09,330
Figured the fuck out.
So I'm upside down.

116
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,300
Growing on the ceiling.
I remember when I came in,

117
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,260
came in the big cave.
It was like a huge fucking crack that

118
00:05:16,261 --> 00:05:20,250
runs along the top turn.
Both my watch is off now at this point

119
00:05:20,251 --> 00:05:23,280
because they're giving off light and I
kill my light and I said that cracked

120
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:26,310
gonna fucking lead to the surface.
That cracks going to fucking give us

121
00:05:26,311 --> 00:05:28,990
something.
So I just called start panicking,

122
00:05:28,991 --> 00:05:31,650
me panicking you again because I'm
panicking.

123
00:05:31,651 --> 00:05:34,410
I don't know what to do.
I'm sucking air and I'm fucking

124
00:05:34,411 --> 00:05:38,190
breathing hard and I'm hyperventilating
and crying and crying on the ceiling,

125
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,120
looking for this fucking cracking.
Goddammit.

126
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:43,620
I found it.
I found the crack and I followed the

127
00:05:43,621 --> 00:05:46,800
crack and the crack got bigger and all
of a sudden I see fucking glow.

128
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,430
Like green glow.
Crawl on Cron.

129
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,520
Cron.
Find it.

130
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:51,990
Try to get up.
My tags are too big.

131
00:05:51,991 --> 00:05:53,520
I can't fucking get out of the little
hole.

132
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:57,890
Can't get out of the hole.
I'm fucking big B.

133
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,960
Big,
big fucking hitting.

134
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,460
Screaming,
freaking out.

135
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,010
Calm down.
Calm down,

136
00:06:03,011 --> 00:06:04,150
Kelly.
This is the way.

137
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:06,080
Calm the fuck down.
Reel it in.

138
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,430
Reel it in.
We're here.

139
00:06:07,431 --> 00:06:08,264
We made it.

140
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:13,600
Grab control.
Follow the cracks more.

141
00:06:13,601 --> 00:06:15,010
Opens up out.
Boom.

142
00:06:15,011 --> 00:06:18,290
There's the K fucking I'm out.
Made it.

143
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:21,460
You're coming home.
You aren't doug about

144
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,930
that was the feeling.
Meanwhile,

145
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:31,960
my guys out there,
I can't be mad at him because he

146
00:06:31,961 --> 00:06:33,160
panicked.
He grabbed the line,

147
00:06:33,161 --> 00:06:38,161
he fucking ran out the whole.
He looks at me and he says,

148
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,873
um,

149
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:46,890
so we're not diving together ever again.
I said,

150
00:06:46,891 --> 00:06:47,880
no,
that was it.

151
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,910
That was it.
And I texted my girl,

152
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,570
I love you baby.
And uh,

153
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:58,120
there was a fucking scary moment,
but daddy's coming home.

154
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,800
What is it like to have Jordan Peterson
as a dad?

155
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,210
Is it weird?
Do you have to check yourself

156
00:07:02,211 --> 00:07:03,500
constantly?
Make sure you're on,

157
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,490
on steady ground?
And I'd say anything ridiculous.

158
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,690
No,
not at all.

159
00:07:08,691 --> 00:07:11,030
Not at all.
I didn't realize it was weird until I

160
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:14,790
went away to university and then kind of
style.

161
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:18,320
I was away for awhile and then when I
came back to the house,

162
00:07:18,321 --> 00:07:21,900
especially because the house was full of
like paintings and masks and statues and

163
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,800
like 32 different paint colors and they
came back and was like,

164
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:27,170
oh,
maybe he's a bit eccentric.

165
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,740
No,
he's definitely eccentric.

166
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,160
Um,
we were talking off air about what it

167
00:07:34,161 --> 00:07:39,161
was like to watch your dad become famous
and become famous in his fifties,

168
00:07:39,531 --> 00:07:40,364
right?
Like,

169
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:42,080
yeah,
54,

170
00:07:42,081 --> 00:07:44,660
55.
That's when it became famous before that

171
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,570
relatively unknown,
respected professor.

172
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,830
One issue with this one transgender bill
or the the,

173
00:07:51,831 --> 00:07:56,831
the preferred pronouns bill,
and then boom off to the races.

174
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,640
Yeah,
that's strange.

175
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:00,290
It was.
Yeah.

176
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:03,530
It was super weird.
Especially how the media was portraying

177
00:08:03,531 --> 00:08:07,520
him and how what was actually happening
at the events wasn't what was being

178
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:10,390
portrayed in the media,
so that was weird to watch and then

179
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,890
people recognizing him on the street is
strange.

180
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,460
It's.
Yes,

181
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,510
it's.
When you say what,

182
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,800
what happened in real life was not what
was being portrayed like what was

183
00:08:18,801 --> 00:08:22,100
different.
Mostly what he was saying.

184
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:24,860
So most of what he said is on film
anyway,

185
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:28,520
so you can go to youtube and see what
he's been saying like not there's not

186
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:33,640
like some secret that's going around,
but what's been portrayed has been so

187
00:08:33,801 --> 00:08:35,630
much more negative than what he's
actually said.

188
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:40,520
Or they'll take like sound bites and
just weave a story that isn't quite

189
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:42,410
true.
Which I didn't read it for some reason.

190
00:08:42,411 --> 00:08:45,710
I now it looks silly,
but for some reason I just thought that

191
00:08:45,711 --> 00:08:47,600
what the media was portraying was
honest.

192
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,690
Always.
Yeah.

193
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,583
Yeah.
Me Too.

194
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,650
Yeah.
Yeah.

195
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,140
And it's not.
They're trapped in there and they can't

196
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:55,020
write,
get out.

197
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,040
They.
They didn't have an

198
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,750
option to say,
I don't want to see them.

199
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,910
It's really interesting.
All the different spins though.

200
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
All the different women's spins in w.
One one really bizarre spin that I saw

201
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,350
was this one was saying that this is
indicative of the problem of all comedy

202
00:09:10,351 --> 00:09:15,351
clubs and aggressive male audience and
women sitting there feeling threatened,

203
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:19,030
not being able to use their voice.
I'm like user voice.

204
00:09:19,031 --> 00:09:21,730
Like what are you gonna heckle?
You were saying like you like you would

205
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:25,430
be more empowered if there were more
women so you could heckle is.

206
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,810
That's not cool.
Like you're not supposed to do that at a

207
00:09:27,811 --> 00:09:28,680
comedy club.
Have you.

208
00:09:28,681 --> 00:09:33,650
Don't like someone just don't laugh,
but like one's,

209
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,560
here's the thing.
It's not your job or it's not your place

210
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:41,190
to say that you don't like someone when
the other people do like it.

211
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:44,400
You know if you're right,
if you're going to get up and walk out.

212
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,200
Yeah.
Just like you're going to see a movie.

213
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,770
Like you're an audience member,
right?

214
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:52,440
The deal is you're not there to perform,
the audience is there to just sit there

215
00:09:52,441 --> 00:09:55,980
and laugh or not laugh,
but don't be rude to the other people

216
00:09:55,981 --> 00:09:58,290
that are enjoying it.
So as soon as you break your

217
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:01,030
sensibilities above,
the rest of the audience will.

218
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,260
You are a problem,
right?

219
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:04,080
You've made.
If you decide like,

220
00:10:04,081 --> 00:10:04,930
hey,
I didn't like this,

221
00:10:04,931 --> 00:10:07,140
I'm going to go home and write about it.
That's totally your prerogative.

222
00:10:07,141 --> 00:10:08,700
That's fine.
Get up and walk out.

223
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,050
That's fine.
Go somewhere else and talk about it on

224
00:10:11,051 --> 00:10:13,830
stage yourself.
Nothing wrong with any of those things,

225
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,250
but this,
this one woman's take was like,

226
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,490
women don't feel like they have a.
They can.

227
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:21,690
They have the ability to speak out about
it.

228
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,610
I'm like,
speak out like so you're saying like to

229
00:10:23,611 --> 00:10:24,241
heckle,
Hey,

230
00:10:24,241 --> 00:10:25,680
I don't want you on stage.

231
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:29,070
I know everything about you and your
story.

232
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:33,320
I want you to perform in front of me.
Even those other people laughing,

233
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:36,330
right?
And that these aggressive men were

234
00:10:36,331 --> 00:10:37,860
yelling.
Good to see you back.

235
00:10:37,861 --> 00:10:41,190
Louis aggressive men like,
okay,

236
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:46,590
that's like there's a framing of this
and this is one of its becomes this male

237
00:10:46,591 --> 00:10:51,090
versus female framing that sort of
represents aggressive men,

238
00:10:51,091 --> 00:10:53,610
sexual men doing things to women they
don't want.

239
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,150
The women are sitting there in silence.
They don't want to be there and they

240
00:10:57,151 --> 00:11:01,400
don't have a voice because they feel
overwhelmed and out overpopulated or a

241
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:02,700
outnumbered.
