1
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:06,810
Five for
Abby Martin,

2
00:00:06,811 --> 00:00:08,100
Ladies and gentlemen,
how are you?

3
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:09,750
Great.
How are you today to be here?

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,640
Shit's going down.
Exactly.

5
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:14,520
It's a crazy day for bill cosby.
Woopsies Hey,

6
00:00:14,521 --> 00:00:16,290
I'm,
I'm reeling in that news man.

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,520
Yeah,
I was,

8
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,400
I was wondering what was gonna happen
because the first one was a mistrial was

9
00:00:20,401 --> 00:00:22,410
that would happen.
Yeah,

10
00:00:22,411 --> 00:00:24,180
but what,
so what's the difference between this

11
00:00:24,181 --> 00:00:26,220
one?
Is this a civil suit or is this,

12
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,690
I think these are these fines.
Civil.

13
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,080
This was a,
the retrial,

14
00:00:31,081 --> 00:00:34,470
so he got convicted of charges,
felony,

15
00:00:34,471 --> 00:00:36,660
sexual assault,
three different counts.

16
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,600
Each one carries,
I think at least 10 years.

17
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,900
He could go to jail for 30 years,
which is death for him.

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,500
I mean,
he's,

19
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,940
he's already blind.
Yeah,

20
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:46,740
he's very,
yeah,

21
00:00:46,741 --> 00:00:48,060
he's uh,
he could barely see.

22
00:00:48,061 --> 00:00:48,810
Right.
Good.

23
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:51,150
I'm so happy that he's getting charged
at the end of his life.

24
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:52,770
That's amazing.
He's a creepy dude.

25
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,710
He liked to have sex with lifeless dead
bodies.

26
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:56,641
Yeah.
We were trying to,

27
00:00:56,641 --> 00:00:58,500
I mean,
purely speculation,

28
00:00:58,501 --> 00:01:00,780
right?
Like what would cause someone to want to

29
00:01:00,781 --> 00:01:02,190
do that?
Like what,

30
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,560
but I,
I have this theory,

31
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:09,870
I think a lot of people did that shit in
the 60s I think in the 60s it was a

32
00:01:09,871 --> 00:01:12,300
normal thing to drug people and I think
they,

33
00:01:12,301 --> 00:01:13,740
you know,
remember the terms.

34
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:15,930
Have you ever,
you've heard it slipping someone a

35
00:01:15,931 --> 00:01:16,980
mickey?
They,

36
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,010
I think they used to do that all the
time back then and they didn't think

37
00:01:20,011 --> 00:01:21,540
anything of it.
You know,

38
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:23,550
if he's disgusting,
people are fucking cross.

39
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,740
If you just go back a couple of hundred
years,

40
00:01:25,741 --> 00:01:28,530
like I'm watching the show vikings,
it's great show by the way.

41
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,300
I don't know if you ever wash it out,
but uh,

42
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:33,930
you know,
they were obviously fucking crazy

43
00:01:33,931 --> 00:01:34,230
people.

44
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:37,230
They did wild shit.
But it was common.

45
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:41,490
I mean this was how people live.
They would storm into villages and kill

46
00:01:41,491 --> 00:01:45,270
everybody.
This was normal shit just a thousand

47
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:49,560
years ago or so.
And I think if you go back just a

48
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,900
hundred years,
the way people treated each other was

49
00:01:51,901 --> 00:01:54,600
horrific.
If you go back 50 years ago,

50
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,430
that's bill cosby's era.
I mean,

51
00:01:56,431 --> 00:01:59,520
I really think that people back then
were different.

52
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,500
They didn't have the Internet,
they didn't,

53
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,830
they didn't understand how other people
were viewing their activity.

54
00:02:04,831 --> 00:02:06,630
They thought they could hide this
activity.

55
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,980
And I think there was a group of people
specifically,

56
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:14,250
you know,
partiers that would drug people and I

57
00:02:14,251 --> 00:02:17,280
think it was a normal thing.
I think there's probably a lot of people

58
00:02:17,281 --> 00:02:20,520
out there that are here in this bill
cosby thing and they're thinking about

59
00:02:20,521 --> 00:02:23,130
all the times that they did it.
That is horrifying.

60
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:23,880
It's fucking scary.

61
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,000
Especially when you catch yourself in it
being this like responsible,

62
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:30,420
like I'm in a lecture.
All the black people pull up your pants.

63
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,710
Yeah,
be good.

64
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,690
I remember one time Wanda Sykes
interviewed him at something and he was

65
00:02:36,691 --> 00:02:41,280
a chastising her on the way she was
talking English and he was wearing

66
00:02:41,281 --> 00:02:43,590
sunglasses inside and he's like,
sorry,

67
00:02:43,591 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm just recovering off the raping that
I just said.

68
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:49,080
I can't see people.
You can't look you in the eyes and I'll

69
00:02:49,081 --> 00:02:50,790
raped out.
Oh my God,

70
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:53,760
I'm so happy to hear this.
And did you see Weinstein chased out of

71
00:02:53,761 --> 00:02:56,620
that bar like in Florida or whatever?
Some guy comes up and like slap,

72
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:57,750
oh,
slapped him in the face.

73
00:02:58,530 --> 00:02:59,980
Hopefully that happens to him all over
the

74
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,350
world.
I think that he's a disgusting pig who

75
00:03:02,351 --> 00:03:04,330
should be chased out of every public
forum.

76
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,610
I was just a lot of those out there.
There's a lot,

77
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,700
a lot of creepy humans in this world.
You know,

78
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:13,750
I just,
I think we're in this unprecedented time

79
00:03:13,751 --> 00:03:18,490
of understanding in terms of like the
consequences of your behavior,

80
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:22,450
what you can and can't do now,
and then the fact that people will just,

81
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,760
if you're doing something horrific to
people,

82
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,670
other people are now going to know.
Whereas you know,

83
00:03:27,671 --> 00:03:29,590
like again,
50 years ago nobody fucking knew

84
00:03:29,591 --> 00:03:30,250
anything.
Like,

85
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,050
think about JFK,
right?

86
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:35,190
Think about all the shit that's going on
with trump and trump just kind of this,

87
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,590
it's like water off a duck's back with
trump for whatever reason.

88
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,530
So he's got some strange ability to just
like fake nose.

89
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,800
That's his brand.
His brand is being a misogynist piece.

90
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,090
Yeah,
it's spelled lightheart.

91
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,180
Well,
it's also,

92
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,590
he does,
he's,

93
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:51,370
he just says it's lies and he just keeps
going and everybody knows it's not a lie

94
00:03:51,371 --> 00:03:52,330
and be like,
what are you going to do it while he's

95
00:03:52,331 --> 00:03:56,020
not freaking out,
he's acting like businesses usual and

96
00:03:56,021 --> 00:03:57,830
somehow or another that's okay.
Like it's,

97
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:01,870
but if you go back to like what JFK was
up to,

98
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:05,320
like JFK was a fucking freak and
everybody knows it.

99
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:05,861
It's like,
Yep.

100
00:04:05,861 --> 00:04:09,100
Comic.
But he was a freak in the area,

101
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:13,720
in the era where the press knew
everything that was going on and

102
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:15,310
everybody like kind of kept her mouth
shut.

103
00:04:15,311 --> 00:04:18,310
And everybody,
there was like an unspoken agreement

104
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,980
that they wouldn't report on affairs and
all the other stuff.

105
00:04:20,981 --> 00:04:24,970
And it's just,
it's fascinating to see our culture

106
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,540
change wildly over a short period of
time.

107
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,520
Yeah.
The tabloid journalism has taken

108
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:31,880
completely over.
I mean,

109
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:33,010
it's true.
It's good,

110
00:04:33,011 --> 00:04:35,260
but um,
to see what these people are really

111
00:04:35,261 --> 00:04:35,711
doing.
But yeah,

112
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:38,550
you're totally right.
JFK was a complete womanizer and it's

113
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:42,520
like lauded as this hero still,
I think everybody was back then.

114
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:45,580
I think that's what they did.
That's why they want it to be present in

115
00:04:45,581 --> 00:04:48,460
the first place so they can just fuck
everything that moves.

116
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:53,590
I'll try to save the free world where
it's fucking weird.

117
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,410
You know?
W W we're in a strange time.

118
00:04:56,411 --> 00:05:00,430
I think historians in the future,
when they go back to the period where

119
00:05:00,431 --> 00:05:04,120
the Internet was created essentially was
like 94 when it became mainstream.

120
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:07,900
I think they're going to look at this
time between 94 and 2018 is

121
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:12,940
unprecedented explosion of change.
Trump is nuts.

122
00:05:12,941 --> 00:05:14,230
I don't understand why,
you know,

123
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:16,030
the stormy Daniels thing I feel like
could be,

124
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,010
isn't doing,
I don't think anything is going to come

125
00:05:18,011 --> 00:05:19,900
out of the Russia stuff.
I think that if anything,

126
00:05:19,901 --> 00:05:21,520
it's going to come out of the Michael
Cohen.

127
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,533
Yeah.
Okay.

128
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,780
But Hen pardoning Libya is basically him
sending a message saying,

129
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,610
don't worry man,
I got your back.

130
00:05:27,611 --> 00:05:29,470
I'm in a part in you.
If you go to jail to come.

131
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,840
And I think cause I mean,
why the hell?

132
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:33,310
Why else?
Why else would you just pardon Dick

133
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,350
Cheney's former man.
Oh yeah,

134
00:05:35,351 --> 00:05:37,990
scooter libby.
I don't understand that.

135
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,610
It was just him basically just being
like,

136
00:05:39,611 --> 00:05:41,290
don't worry bro.
Got Your back.

137
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,170
I'll get you out of prison if Bush,
pardon that guy.

138
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,300
Right?
Yeah.

139
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:47,740
It's,
it's insane.

140
00:05:47,741 --> 00:05:51,400
The trump stuff's nuts.
The stormy Daniels thing is ridiculous.

141
00:05:51,401 --> 00:05:53,110
Did you see that interview with Anderson
Cooper?

142
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,100
No,
I didn't watch that.

143
00:05:54,101 --> 00:05:55,210
And that's,
I mean,

144
00:05:55,211 --> 00:05:57,770
it just,
the craziest part about it is not the

145
00:05:57,771 --> 00:05:58,040
fact that

146
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,160
he had sex with a porn star and that she
was trying to do a transactional thing

147
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:03,980
to get on the apprentice.
It's that he's sent someone a threatened

148
00:06:03,981 --> 00:06:08,270
her and her child after that.
He's fucking nuts.

149
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:09,180
Yeah.
I think,

150
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,580
does he capable of,
you know,

151
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:13,980
I think that's standard operational
procedure for lot of people.

152
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,110
He's a man.
He's a mafia acting dude.

153
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,450
Well that wasn't that what,
who,

154
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,820
who,
who,

155
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,000
who was saying that about,
oh,

156
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,950
call me.
Call me was saying that it was

157
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:29,300
essentially you're reminded him of when
he was prosecuting the mob that they

158
00:06:29,301 --> 00:06:30,530
have this sort of,
you know,

159
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:34,820
same kind of attitude.
This us versus them keep everything

160
00:06:34,821 --> 00:06:36,620
together.
Loyalty is everything.

161
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:37,790
Totally.
Um,

162
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,460
by the way,
great job at stand up.

163
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,530
I've been going to a bunch of standup
shows.

164
00:06:42,531 --> 00:06:47,030
Everyone just talks about jerking off to
pixelated porn in the 80s and their

165
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:47,450
dicks.

166
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:49,100
And I mean you,
you,

167
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:52,160
you're set was awesome and I really
encourage everyone to check it out.

168
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:53,510
It's just,
it was amazing.

169
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,380
Thank you.
Yeah,

170
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:56,900
it was really fucking on a Netflix
special last weekend.

171
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,040
How was,
it was great.

172
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,720
I'm very excited.
Very happy.

173
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:02,150
What is it called?
I haven't decided yet.

174
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,720
The tour I was calling strange times.
Cause you know,

175
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:08,060
obviously we're in strange times.
I might just keep that.

176
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:09,710
I don't know.
I made my change the name.

177
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:10,640
I don't know.
I'd have a really,

178
00:07:10,641 --> 00:07:11,930
haven't decided.
I was impressed.

179
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,760
There's a lot of really good jokes about
trump,

180
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:17,210
which is you would think would be easy.
But I guess for Comedians it's probably

181
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:21,500
not easy because it's so satirical that
we're living in.

182
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:25,070
Well yeah,
the problem is reality is already a

183
00:07:25,071 --> 00:07:26,200
joke.
It's like,

184
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:30,830
so it's so crazy that you have to have,
you have to figure out what is your

185
00:07:30,831 --> 00:07:32,790
unique perspective,
you know,

186
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,820
if you have one,
you know,

187
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:39,880
I just think we're very childlike in
what we do with an,

188
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,170
you know,
how we treat our leaders and how we

189
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:43,160
choose our leaders.

190
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:48,160
And I'm really fascinated by the cult of
personality that goes behind really any

191
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,590
big time leader,
whether it's trump or Obama,

192
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,830
there's people that think that person
can do no wrong.

193
00:07:54,831 --> 00:07:56,660
I was very fascinated by that.
With Hillary.

194
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:01,670
There was a giant group of people that
refuse to look at any of the things that

195
00:08:01,671 --> 00:08:05,840
Hillary was doing that were wrong.
Any of the things like the Clinton

196
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,870
Foundation or those speeches that she
was giving to these bankers where she

197
00:08:08,871 --> 00:08:12,080
wouldn't release the transcripts or the
lies that she would talk about.

198
00:08:12,081 --> 00:08:16,850
The difference between Colome's version
of what the FBI had found her to have

199
00:08:16,851 --> 00:08:20,690
done wrong versus her version of it.
And there's a video where you see the

200
00:08:20,691 --> 00:08:23,450
two of them back to back and she's a
deceptive person.

201
00:08:23,451 --> 00:08:25,910
She's clearly a liar.
She's not,

202
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:30,440
she's not a good person.
She's not like this shining example of

203
00:08:30,441 --> 00:08:34,790
what we would like our leader to be.
We'd like our lead like love or hate or

204
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,920
Obama.
What that guy was.

205
00:08:36,921 --> 00:08:40,400
To me it was like a statesman.
Like he's so the way he would

206
00:08:40,401 --> 00:08:44,750
communicate with so calm and smooth and
he was,

207
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:45,621
you know,
if he,

208
00:08:45,621 --> 00:08:49,130
even if he didn't like his policy,
you got to admit the guy was incredibly

209
00:08:49,131 --> 00:08:52,040
articulate,
beautifully literate,

210
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:53,810
like the way he would speak and
communicate.

211
00:08:53,811 --> 00:08:58,811
He was well read like he to me
represented what I would like the

212
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:02,210
version of the person who's running the
big thing to be.

213
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:05,430
And I think that's the whole crux of,
of people who have brainwashed

214
00:09:05,431 --> 00:09:09,810
themselves into thinking there's some
sort of like deep state apparatus that's

215
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:11,940
outing trump.
I think that their real problem,

216
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:13,170
look,
the deep state is the military

217
00:09:13,171 --> 00:09:15,030
industrial complex.
They're winning at the end of the day,

218
00:09:15,031 --> 00:09:17,970
no matter what defense contractors,
stocks are skyrocketing,

219
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:21,780
trump is basically the de facto arms
salesmen and chief on the phone at the

220
00:09:21,781 --> 00:09:24,450
Japanese prime minister being like hog
these killer drones bro.

221
00:09:24,451 --> 00:09:26,010
Like we got to sell these surveillance
drones.

222
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,170
That's who's going to win.
At the end of the day,

223
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,520
the neo liberal establishment is who
hates him because he removes the mask of

224
00:09:32,521 --> 00:09:33,450
empire,
right?

225
00:09:33,451 --> 00:09:35,400
That's what he does.
He removes the mask.

226
00:09:35,401 --> 00:09:38,670
He's making it less palatable to sell
imperialism around the world,

227
00:09:38,671 --> 00:09:40,860
and I think that's,
that's the crux of why you see a kind of

228
00:09:40,861 --> 00:09:44,460
these think tankers and the liberals on
on TV,

229
00:09:44,461 --> 00:09:47,910
and we can get into this later,
but there's a whole misnomer going on

230
00:09:47,911 --> 00:09:50,160
about the left and a miss
characterization about the left.

231
00:09:50,161 --> 00:09:52,140
The left has no fucking power in this
country.

232
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,130
The left has no voice in terms of news
coverage.

233
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:59,460
So all these people,
she has not left.

234
00:09:59,461 --> 00:10:01,980
She has a new liberal corporate shill.

235
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:05,440
You,
you say that and so does Jimmy Dore.

236
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:08,260
Jimmy Dore says the same thing.
Yeah.

237
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:11,110
He just thinks that she does not
represent

238
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,360
the left,
not at all.

239
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:15,120
And there's a myth of,
of the fact that the media is liberal in

240
00:10:15,121 --> 00:10:15,990
general.
I think that,

241
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,130
you know,
tv,

242
00:10:17,131 --> 00:10:20,070
culture aside,
news is not,

243
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:22,890
there is no liberal media.
Media is owned by multinational

244
00:10:22,891 --> 00:10:24,990
corporations,
with conservative business owners that

245
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:28,190
have interlocking boards of director.
It's at defense contractors,

246
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,400
Monsanto,
et Cetera.

247
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:31,770
Those people are fucking liberal.
They're not left.

248
00:10:31,771 --> 00:10:34,620
They pushed down their policies.
It doesn't matter if you're a Maoist

249
00:10:34,621 --> 00:10:37,920
working at Washington Times,
you're not gonna be able to put out that

250
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:41,910
contradictory narrative that your
shareholders are pushing.

251
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:43,230
Um,
it's,

252
00:10:43,231 --> 00:10:46,620
it's really unfortunate that the left
has been basically,

253
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,560
I don't know,
I mean they've just demonize the entire

254
00:10:49,561 --> 00:10:53,340
left where now you have the NRA
fomenting civil war against the fucking

255
00:10:53,341 --> 00:10:55,290
left.
Trump and all of his followers are just

256
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:58,800
like the left is what's really wrong
with this country where there's no

257
00:10:58,801 --> 00:11:00,720
power.
We don't have any power.

258
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:04,540
You have given me like I have more of a
platform than probably any other leftist

259
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,840
because you have given me a platform on
the show.

260
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,200
When have you ever heard my views?
Like on TV ever?

261
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:11,380
You know what I mean?

262
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,340
Well,
when you were on tv,

263
00:11:12,341 --> 00:11:16,060
I heard them,
which is why we go to archie.

264
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,620
It's nuts.
Yeah.

265
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,710
But that's a weird thing to write
because people think of Russia.

266
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:23,740
Russia is the great enemy and you were
on Russia today.

267
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,930
That'd be Martins.
She's a tool of the Russians,

268
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,440
the Russians,
the Russians.

269
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,440
The Russians were nothing forever like
the Russians,

270
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:34,870
like we got through the Cold War,
like all the Russians are friends now

271
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,330
who,
because when I was in high school we

272
00:11:37,331 --> 00:11:39,310
were always worried we're going to get
bombed by the Russians.

273
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:42,220
That shit went over.
Why does it feel to just have that back?

274
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,200
It feels weird.
I don't believe it.

275
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:46,120
I don't believe we're going to get
bombed by the Russians.

276
00:11:46,121 --> 00:11:48,910
I don't think we're going to bomb them.
I don't think they're going to bomb us.

277
00:11:48,911 --> 00:11:53,911
And I think as cliche as it sounds,
mutually assured is probably a really

278
00:11:54,731 --> 00:11:57,700
good incentive to not launch missiles
into the air.

279
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,830
I think that's still real.
What do you think about the serious

280
00:11:59,831 --> 00:12:01,210
stuff?
Scares the shit out of me.

281
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:04,780
Everything.
Anything to do with Isis,

282
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:09,490
anything to do with like ideological
warfare.

283
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,200
All that stuff scares the shit out of
me.

284
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:12,101
You know,
when you,

285
00:12:12,101 --> 00:12:14,080
when you see what people are capable of
doing,

286
00:12:14,081 --> 00:12:17,290
if they really believe in their cause
and they really believe God's on their

287
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:18,640
side,
they really believe.

288
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:22,930
And also if you really believe you've
been fucked over by the Great Satan,

289
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,260
all that stuff scares the shit out of me
because most people were blissfully

290
00:12:26,261 --> 00:12:29,170
unaware of what the United States and
you know,

291
00:12:29,171 --> 00:12:33,100
what the commander in chief or whoever
the fuck is pulling the strings is doing

292
00:12:33,101 --> 00:12:36,100
overseas and what the repercussions of
those actions is going to be.

293
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:36,480
Okay.

294
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:36,931
Yeah.
That,

295
00:12:36,931 --> 00:12:40,920
that the guy who I think,
I don't know when the Quebec Mosque

296
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,010
mosque shooting was,
but his basically his justification was,

297
00:12:44,011 --> 00:12:45,610
you know,
Islamic terrorism won.

298
00:12:45,611 --> 00:12:47,940
It made me do this.
So if that's the case,

299
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,430
what are all the people that we kill
with drones?

300
00:12:50,431 --> 00:12:54,510
And we just killed the bride at a
fucking wedding party in Yemen.

301
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,160
So another one of those,
yes.

302
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:00,210
Bomb wedding part at least eight.
I think that's our thing.

303
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,560
Yeah.
And it's deliberate because we're

304
00:13:01,561 --> 00:13:04,170
supplying intelligence and weapons to
Saudi Arabia.

305
00:13:04,171 --> 00:13:05,250
It's not just,
you know,

306
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:06,780
we supply them weapons and turned a
blind eye.

307
00:13:06,781 --> 00:13:10,690
We are supplying military intelligence
and targets for them to bomb and we're

308
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:12,270
actively helping them do that.
So yeah,

309
00:13:12,271 --> 00:13:15,020
they just bombed another wedding party
on top of the funerals,

310
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:16,940
but all schools.
But why are they,

311
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,540
why wedding parties is,
was there someone in the wedding party

312
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:21,100
they were trying to get,
or was it a mistake?

313
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,310
I don't even know what the official line
is,

314
00:13:23,311 --> 00:13:26,400
but how many wedding parties can you
bomb before we draw our red line?

315
00:13:26,401 --> 00:13:27,510
I mean,
it's just disgusting.

316
00:13:27,511 --> 00:13:29,190
And they killed the bride.
They killed the fucking,

317
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:31,050
so what are all these people who grow
up?

318
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,350
This was supposed to be the happiest day
of their lives and now you know,

319
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,070
are they gonna grow up wanting to,
to kill Americans?

320
00:13:37,071 --> 00:13:38,430
I mean,
blaming the marriage.

321
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,670
Yeah.
If you were conspiracy theorists,

322
00:13:40,671 --> 00:13:42,700
that's what you'd say.
You would say the reason why they're

323
00:13:42,701 --> 00:13:46,360
doing this is that the United States
wants an endless war.

324
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:51,570
The best way to insure it and this war
is to occasionally blow up some people

325
00:13:51,641 --> 00:13:55,030
that really have no dog in the fight.
And you create a bunch of radicals.

326
00:13:55,031 --> 00:13:57,880
You create people that are hell bent on
revenge because that,

327
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,430
that's the real hardcore conspiracy
theory,

328
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,690
the Alex Jones take on it.

329
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:03,350
I think that,
uh,

330
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:05,430
a good way to look at the world as,
you know,

331
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,720
there's the colonizers and colonize the,
the,

332
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:11,880
the states that are basically remaining
that we know that the establishment or

333
00:14:11,881 --> 00:14:13,740
the empire wants to take down.
And Iran,

334
00:14:13,741 --> 00:14:15,150
Syria,
Venezuela,

335
00:14:15,151 --> 00:14:16,110
North Korea,
right?

336
00:14:16,111 --> 00:14:17,160
What,
what do they all have in common?

337
00:14:17,161 --> 00:14:18,120
They're all,
uh,

338
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:23,450
independent of our economic a Gemini.
And so we use our economic and military

339
00:14:23,941 --> 00:14:25,920
might to commit violence around the
world,

340
00:14:25,921 --> 00:14:29,400
to subject these countries to bend to
our will economically.

341
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:32,790
And it's really obvious and
unfortunately people just continue to

342
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:36,960
buy into this humanitarian bullshit
propaganda no matter who's in office.

343
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,890
Yeah.
It doesn't matter who's in office.

344
00:14:38,891 --> 00:14:42,160
If you look at like the actions that the
Obama administration took versus the

345
00:14:42,161 --> 00:14:44,890
action the Bush administration took
their super similar.

346
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:45,970
Yeah.
Yeah.

347
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,560
And this whole deep state thing.
I mean,

348
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:49,960
look,
as junior I the deep state,

349
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:52,010
the deep state I think is

350
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:54,860
the military industrial complex.
It's the machine that churns on no

351
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:57,140
matter who is the commander in chief,
it doesn't matter.

352
00:14:57,141 --> 00:14:58,880
Right?
They're not trying to get rid of trump.

353
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,770
Absolutely not.
They love him,

354
00:15:00,771 --> 00:15:01,604
dude.
Right?

355
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,260
They love this.
So look,

356
00:15:03,261 --> 00:15:05,630
trump has a lot of enemies because he's
a scorched earth.

357
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:09,590
Like he pissed a lot of people off.
So of course you have tons of people who

358
00:15:09,591 --> 00:15:12,290
hate him.
It appears that the media is uniformly

359
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:15,890
against him,
but I think it's because God can we pull

360
00:15:15,891 --> 00:15:20,090
up that Kanye club look okay,
Kanye on and look up Vic Berger,

361
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:24,290
Kanye on Ellen.
This Shit Burger on twitter.

362
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,390
Twitter's an animal.
Did He,

363
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,360
have you seen the ellen one where Kanye,
isn't it?

364
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:29,480
Oh Man.
Recent.

365
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,980
No,
it's just amazing.

366
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:32,510
Just something he put together.
Yeah.

367
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,313
Wow.

368
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,620
Hold on a second.
Wait,

369
00:15:36,621 --> 00:15:38,480
look at Ellen.
Just look at his face.

370
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,230
When was this from?
No,

371
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:43,783
maybe

372
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:51,600
we're looking at Kanye can want more
children.

373
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:56,040
Make crazy faces now he gets really good
one more.

374
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:03,010
This camp where he is in the bed.
Yeah.

375
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:16,520
That a context.
The real question.

376
00:16:16,521 --> 00:16:18,650
That way it gets really good though.

377
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:22,960
Okay.
I'm with you.

378
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:29,773
What does he say?

379
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:33,590
Oh yeah.
He's in the building.

380
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:34,683
Oh,
read this part.

381
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,470
What's dead?
Picasso.

382
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,980
Steve jobs is dead.
What?

383
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:41,840
Disney is dead.
I'm dead.

384
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:44,840
What?
Look at that one.

385
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:52,780
It Ain't no joke is rock cam said.

386
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:59,350
Did you see that?
He wrote that he was going to be the

387
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:04,351
next president died from TMZ.
They called them erratic.

388
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:06,040
He's like,
please don't call me erratic.

389
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:08,830
You're speaking to your next president.
Oh my God.

390
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:11,890
Did you see Kim say like,
look,

391
00:17:11,891 --> 00:17:13,900
you guys,
Connie was just living in the future in

392
00:17:13,901 --> 00:17:15,040
a couple of years.
Um,

393
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:17,920
someone else is going to say what he
does and you're going to praise him.

394
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,491
Oh,
it's like,

395
00:17:18,491 --> 00:17:18,950
really?
Yeah.

396
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:22,480
She's just trying to keep him home.
Just like she's got to say whatever she

397
00:17:22,481 --> 00:17:25,870
can keep it from vanishing.
So bizarre though,

398
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:26,680
right?
Yeah.

399
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,320
Yeah.
I wish I knew what was really going on.

400
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:33,400
Like Jamie thinks it's a big part of it,
a big publicity stunt because he's got

401
00:17:33,401 --> 00:17:34,270
an album coming out.
Look at them,

402
00:17:34,271 --> 00:17:38,020
look at them nodding a million percent.
Miller's a huge tracking number.

403
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,650
All you have to do is be,
you know,

404
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:42,700
a token person and like the joy villa
woman who was like,

405
00:17:42,701 --> 00:17:44,020
all right,
I'm going to wear a trump dress to the

406
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,260
grammys and then I'm going to just
gonna,

407
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:47,650
you know,
sell tons of records because there is a

408
00:17:47,651 --> 00:17:50,190
huge vacuum to be filled of trump
supporters

409
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:51,600
who are looking for people like this.

410
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:53,750
There's definitely that.
There's definitely that.

411
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,990
It's fascinating to me.
It's really interesting because he's

412
00:17:56,991 --> 00:18:00,710
changed the wha what's possible.
And this is one thing that trump has

413
00:18:00,711 --> 00:18:02,870
absolutely done.
Like when he won,

414
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:07,790
like Nag changes who can be president,
it really does because it's now like,

415
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:10,130
okay,
we know that the,

416
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,950
I mean we've,
we've already decided we're willing to

417
00:18:12,951 --> 00:18:15,470
elect someone that we know really
probably shouldn't be doing it.

418
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,950
So now what?
Like we're just electing a famous

419
00:18:18,951 --> 00:18:19,970
person.
So what's,

420
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:20,843
who is that?

421
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,720
Well,
what about Oprah?

422
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:23,531
Yeah.
It's like,

423
00:18:23,531 --> 00:18:24,161
no.
Well,

424
00:18:24,161 --> 00:18:27,130
how about fucking NBC tweeted,
you know,

425
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,960
our president,
oh,

426
00:18:28,961 --> 00:18:32,590
like a speech by our president gives a
good fucking speech and then we should

427
00:18:32,591 --> 00:18:35,950
vote them into office.
Who the fuck is in control of the NBC

428
00:18:35,951 --> 00:18:39,070
twitter page?
They wrote something about a speech from

429
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:42,070
our all cabs president.
Like what?

430
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:45,130
Wait a minute.
I thought the rock was going to run for

431
00:18:45,131 --> 00:18:46,300
a while.
And then I was like,

432
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,493
yeah,
well,

433
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:51,400
and then I saw that he had had big
dinner with the Saudi king and he was

434
00:18:51,401 --> 00:18:52,061
like,
Oh man,

435
00:18:52,061 --> 00:18:54,100
like next time I'm bringing the Tequila
to your house.

436
00:18:54,101 --> 00:18:56,710
And everyone was like,
Saudi Arabia is a dry country dude.

437
00:18:56,711 --> 00:18:57,370
Like,
and he was like,

438
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:58,810
Oh shit.
And then he deleted the tweet.

439
00:18:58,811 --> 00:19:00,580
It's like,
obviously you just drank a giant bottle

440
00:19:00,581 --> 00:19:03,220
of Tequila with the king and the king's
not Saudi Arabia.

441
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,440
Yeah.
Oh.

442
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:06,190
And,
and um,

443
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,210
who else was there?
Oh,

444
00:19:07,211 --> 00:19:09,450
Morgan Freeman.
The Voice of God and Hillary Clinton's

445
00:19:09,451 --> 00:19:12,400
soul was,
was with the Rock and the king of Saudi

446
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,540
Arabia.
Somehow this is cool,

447
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:14,141
you know,
but,

448
00:19:14,141 --> 00:19:17,200
but Sharla sod is a monster,
yet the king of Saudi Arabia is a cool

449
00:19:17,201 --> 00:19:19,040
dude who we should have dinner with.
That makes sense.

450
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:20,800
Is this the young king that's trying to
like,

451
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:23,410
yeah.
What is his deal?

452
00:19:23,411 --> 00:19:26,170
He's like,
he locked up all those people for who

453
00:19:26,171 --> 00:19:28,060
the hell knows?
Probably to consolidate power.

454
00:19:28,061 --> 00:19:29,950
I mean that was the line that came out
was like,

455
00:19:29,951 --> 00:19:30,581
oh,
he's,

456
00:19:30,581 --> 00:19:31,610
you know,
he's revolutionary.

457
00:19:31,611 --> 00:19:33,160
He's reformist.
But I mean,

458
00:19:33,161 --> 00:19:36,560
I think that it was just to consolidate
power is a power grab and goes,

459
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,730
hey,
come on as a Saudi Arabia,

460
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:43,020
listen to it can even drive there now.
So why don't you relax?

461
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,200
They can write but not at night or
something like that.

462
00:19:47,201 --> 00:19:47,621
Hey.
Right.

463
00:19:47,621 --> 00:19:50,500
They still have to have their mail and
guardian escort them around.

464
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:52,900
So Dude,
last time we were on,

465
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:55,480
wow.
Crazy,

466
00:19:55,481 --> 00:19:57,130
crazy stuff happened after that.
Right.

467
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:58,623
New jobs,

468
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:03,880
gigantic pile of email,
thankfully to the wrong email address.

469
00:20:03,881 --> 00:20:06,580
But I still was aware of them,
uh,

470
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,730
have a bunch of people and it was a,
it was like a,

471
00:20:08,731 --> 00:20:10,940
a form letter.
Um,

472
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:15,820
talking about how you're a liar and
you're anti Israel and none of this

473
00:20:15,821 --> 00:20:20,821
stuff is happening between Israel and
the,

474
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,750
I just,
yeah,

475
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,430
it was,
it got weird.

476
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:27,250
It got weird.
It was like a hundreds and hundreds and

477
00:20:27,251 --> 00:20:28,100
hundreds of emails

478
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:31,180
and that's,
and that's a campaign that's a campaign

479
00:20:31,181 --> 00:20:34,480
with large amount of money behind it
because the Israeli lobby likes to come

480
00:20:34,481 --> 00:20:37,840
down very hard on people who speak out
against the crimes of Israel.

481
00:20:37,841 --> 00:20:39,460
As you see,
this is a third rail issue.

482
00:20:39,461 --> 00:20:41,740
No one talks about it even though it's
so fucking obvious.

483
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:42,820
I mean,
we heard the mantra,

484
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:45,250
Putin kills journalists all the time.
Well,

485
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:50,280
Israeli of forces are sniping
journalists and children on camera and

486
00:20:51,371 --> 00:20:53,020
yet the world turns a blind eye.
Well,

487
00:20:53,021 --> 00:20:56,470
someone got killed just a few days ago.
A journalist just died yesterday.

488
00:20:56,471 --> 00:20:57,770
He was shot in the abdomen.
Yeah,

489
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,280
they're all Palestinian.
There's been no Israeli casualties,

490
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,840
wounded or otherwise.
But yes,

491
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:04,930
stand with us is a,
is directly funded by the Israeli

492
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:06,790
government.
It's part of their giant Hasbro

493
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:07,900
operation.
And that's,

494
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:10,360
they made a video.
They were promoting a video,

495
00:21:10,361 --> 00:21:12,400
kind of trying to debunk what I said on
here.

496
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:14,770
Look,
you can look at the empire files and see

497
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,800
all of the documentation of what I said.
That's your style.

498
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:19,050
That's all my stuff.
Yeah,

499
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:23,800
the empire files on the empire files.tv
and it's a youtube channel that you can

500
00:21:23,801 --> 00:21:25,960
subscribe to too.
But I mean it's just very easy,

501
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:30,430
easily verifiable facts like that
Israeli military law governs the West

502
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:32,050
Bank.
This is verifiable in five seconds on

503
00:21:32,051 --> 00:21:34,600
Amnesty International.
So it was just very desperate measures

504
00:21:34,601 --> 00:21:38,470
to try to obfuscate what I was saying.
And this is really all they have left

505
00:21:38,471 --> 00:21:40,810
because the tide is turning man.
I mean,

506
00:21:40,811 --> 00:21:42,460
look,
Natalie Portman just signed on to

507
00:21:42,461 --> 00:21:45,940
boycott this conference in Israel and
they are running scared.

508
00:21:45,941 --> 00:21:47,590
I mean,
they're trying to revoke her citizenship

509
00:21:47,591 --> 00:21:50,140
because she's basically participating in
bds.

510
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:52,630
Um,
because she said recent events have made

511
00:21:52,631 --> 00:21:55,390
her greatly disturbed as it should
disturb everyone.

512
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,730
The fact that there's this ongoing
massacre.

513
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:00,640
And if I could just explain to people
what's going on really quickly,

514
00:22:00,641 --> 00:22:02,290
it is horrifying you guys.
I mean,

515
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,510
there's a thing called the great march
of return,

516
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:08,980
and it's been completely nonviolent on
the side of Palestinians.

517
00:22:08,981 --> 00:22:11,260
It's in Gaza,
which is the open air prison where about

518
00:22:11,261 --> 00:22:13,690
2 million people are housed in cage like
animals,

519
00:22:13,691 --> 00:22:16,540
and they're not allowed to leave.
I can't think of any other place in the

520
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:19,930
world that refugees actually can't leave
otherwise there'll be shot.

521
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,230
So there's like Israeli guard posts
surrounding this place that count their

522
00:22:23,231 --> 00:22:24,190
calories.
They,

523
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:27,250
they don't let them have concrete
anything that can be construed as a

524
00:22:27,251 --> 00:22:28,084
weapon,
et cetera.

525
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:29,001
So anyway,
they,

526
00:22:29,001 --> 00:22:31,240
they're protesting this,
right because they have no dignity,

527
00:22:31,241 --> 00:22:33,880
no humanity,
no agency to live their lives.

528
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,150
And so they're protesting nonviolently.
They're going up to the,

529
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:41,140
to the fence and you know,
thousands and thousands of them and 40

530
00:22:41,141 --> 00:22:42,310
people have just been executed.

531
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:46,870
There's Israeli soldiers sitting up
perched on a hilltop with sniper scopes.

532
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:49,360
This isn't just random gunfire that
people are being hit with.

533
00:22:49,361 --> 00:22:52,990
They are deliberately attacking every
single person with head shots,

534
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,770
with genitalia shots.
It's sick and press.

535
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,360
There's people marked press.
I mean,

536
00:22:58,361 --> 00:23:00,080
that's an egregious war crime.
Yeah.

537
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,540
You have Nikki Haley,
uh,

538
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:04,900
vetoing every single UN resolution or
investigation into Israel.

539
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:09,300
I can't imagine another country.
So I think that you look,

540
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:13,570
Israel can only survive with us
sponsorship and we love to have that

541
00:23:13,571 --> 00:23:16,270
beach head in the Middle East.
We love to have that military garrison

542
00:23:16,271 --> 00:23:19,300
because we use Israel.
Like what happened in Syria,

543
00:23:19,301 --> 00:23:21,940
we used as real to bomb Syria first to
test the waters.

544
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:25,720
We use Israeli forces to execute nuclear
scientists in Iran.

545
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:30,040
We use the massage to do all kinds of
stuff so that we love to have that kind

546
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:31,510
of,
you know,

547
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,010
military,
military,

548
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:37,120
post outpost in the Middle East that we
can use to try to intimidate all those

549
00:23:37,121 --> 00:23:40,390
postcolonial states that are independent
or we want to overthrow.

550
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,320
So I think that's why,
you know,

551
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,181
a lot of people say,
oh,

552
00:23:43,181 --> 00:23:45,650
the lobby controls us and I think that
that's wrong.

553
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,240
Um,
I think that there's a lot of lobbies

554
00:23:47,241 --> 00:23:48,610
that have influenced,
but I think it's,

555
00:23:48,611 --> 00:23:51,650
it's more strategic than that.
I really do.

556
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:56,540
And so
for the Palestinians,

557
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:01,670
the Palestinians that are trapped in
Gaza and if they leave,

558
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:04,490
there's no other way to go other than
through Israel.

559
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:05,983
Yeah.
Well they,

560
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,700
yes.
And a lot of people are like,

561
00:24:07,701 --> 00:24:09,920
oh,
well what about Egypt and Jordan?

562
00:24:09,921 --> 00:24:11,420
They can,
they can try to go out that way.

563
00:24:11,421 --> 00:24:13,400
No,
I mean basically they're all in cahoots

564
00:24:13,401 --> 00:24:16,640
with the Netanyahu is administration and
they're all basically client states of

565
00:24:16,641 --> 00:24:19,190
the u s so no,
they can't leave.

566
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:22,070
And Israel controls their water,
the passageways,

567
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,440
everything that they don't let them
leave.

568
00:24:24,441 --> 00:24:27,470
Like a lot of these people who have been
shot with sniper rifles can't even get

569
00:24:27,471 --> 00:24:29,180
treatment because they're denied
treatment.

570
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:32,450
So there's so many amputations that are
totally unnecessary.

571
00:24:32,451 --> 00:24:34,730
So now that you have like thousands of
people who are just amputated,

572
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:39,680
5,000 people have been shot with live
ammunition and you've been there.

573
00:24:39,681 --> 00:24:41,270
And how much time did you spend when you
were there?

574
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:45,890
So I was in the West Bank for a month
and they let you go back and forth from

575
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,800
Gaza to know.
Unfortunately I was banned from Gaza

576
00:24:48,801 --> 00:24:52,370
because I was told I was a propagandist.
And I was not a real journalist and I

577
00:24:52,371 --> 00:24:55,100
was told I was an Iranian agent,
which was confusing because I thought it

578
00:24:55,101 --> 00:24:59,370
was a Russian agent who was the press
minister of Israel who,

579
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,190
yeah.
Yeah.

580
00:25:01,191 --> 00:25:04,160
So I think they thought it was,
they probably calculated that it would

581
00:25:04,161 --> 00:25:08,270
be less risky to just block me from
entering then having me go in and show

582
00:25:08,271 --> 00:25:10,880
the horrors and the abuses that are
going on there.

583
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:15,410
But I mean we're talking about executing
children and s sniper scopes and there's

584
00:25:15,411 --> 00:25:18,260
videos of these soldiers gleefully
laughing.

585
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,670
They are literally like,
man,

586
00:25:19,671 --> 00:25:22,240
did you see his legs go up?
Like look at that shit man out.

587
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:25,970
You get a headshot.
IDF soldiers have tee shirts where they

588
00:25:25,971 --> 00:25:28,520
have pregnant women in crosshairs.
It says one shot,

589
00:25:28,521 --> 00:25:30,530
two kills.
Like these people are fucking sick.

590
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,460
Yeah.
Yes there is.

591
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:34,850
Look it up.
IDF soldier,

592
00:25:34,851 --> 00:25:38,210
pregnant women tee shirt.
They also have cross hairs of a babies.

593
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:40,270
Um,
yeah.

594
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:42,080
And then,
and then not only that,

595
00:25:42,081 --> 00:25:47,081
but on top of all of this happening,
you have colonial settlers who come down

596
00:25:47,241 --> 00:25:48,560
and they're cheering them on.
They're like,

597
00:25:48,561 --> 00:25:51,080
this is the best show in town.
They're sitting there drinking coffee

598
00:25:51,081 --> 00:25:55,040
and beer and just cheering on this
massacre that's been going on for four

599
00:25:55,041 --> 00:25:56,030
weeks.
Okay.

600
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,290
There it is.

601
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:59,510
I want to shot to kills.
Wow.

602
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:01,280
Yeah.
That's crazy.

603
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:04,820
So to stand with us,
that organization,

604
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:08,140
that is a crazy fucking tee shirts.
Yeah.

605
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,230
So stand with us and all these other
organizations that work on the behalf of

606
00:26:12,231 --> 00:26:14,960
the Israeli government to try to smear
anyone who criticizes it.

607
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,160
Your time is up,
man.

608
00:26:16,161 --> 00:26:18,980
People are waking up.
You can't just keep executing people on

609
00:26:18,981 --> 00:26:21,490
camera and getting away with it.
And you know,

610
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:25,430
if stand with us means stand with the
snipers shooting kids from a sniper

611
00:26:25,431 --> 00:26:27,050
scope,
why are they doing this?

612
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:30,290
They want to terrorize and put fear in
the hearts of these people.

613
00:26:30,291 --> 00:26:34,070
They don't want them to protest.
They want them to sub submit,

614
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:38,780
they want them to submit and they want,
they basically have dehumanize them to

615
00:26:38,781 --> 00:26:39,830
the point where they,
you know,

616
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:42,440
you can't,
you can't put a kid in a sniper scope

617
00:26:42,441 --> 00:26:44,430
and kill him unless you are.

618
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,920
You have completely dehumanized them to
the point where you think that he's an

619
00:26:46,921 --> 00:26:48,330
animal.
Um,

620
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:50,160
and that's just,
that's just how it works.

621
00:26:50,161 --> 00:26:52,800
I mean there had been so dehumanized
there.

622
00:26:52,801 --> 00:26:55,690
It's not even funny.
And what these people are asking is,

623
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,840
is very simple.
They want the right to return,

624
00:26:57,841 --> 00:27:02,190
which is authorized by the UN.
When the refugees were expelled in 1948

625
00:27:02,191 --> 00:27:05,310
715 turned to Israel,
the right to return to Israel and live

626
00:27:05,311 --> 00:27:07,770
as equal citizens.
It's not about,

627
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,260
you know,
a ball like it's not about expelling the

628
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:14,310
Jews or people who live there.
It's about living and coexisting and

629
00:27:14,311 --> 00:27:16,740
having equal rights.
Because right now there is an apartheid

630
00:27:16,741 --> 00:27:20,760
state where there's 50 discriminatory
laws within Israel proper.

631
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:22,900
Not to mention the fact that the
Westbank sender,

632
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:26,340
Israeli military law not dimension the
fact that Gaza is an open air prison.

633
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:29,450
So within Israel proper there's
apartheid too.

634
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,840
So it's,
it's sick.

635
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,110
We are sponsoring this with $10 million
a day is real,

636
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:38,310
would not survive without the US,
which is why I focused on ending the u s

637
00:27:38,311 --> 00:27:39,150
empire.
Cause I'm like,

638
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,730
it doesn't matter if everyone in the
world boycotts Israel,

639
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:46,200
we're still going to subsidize the
whores and the daily atrocities with our

640
00:27:46,201 --> 00:27:48,660
tax dollars and they're not going to
stop.

641
00:27:48,661 --> 00:27:50,310
And that's why this is so fucking
brazen.

642
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:51,750
Wow.
Have we been vindicated,

643
00:27:51,751 --> 00:27:53,970
Joe?
Because I can't think of another.

644
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:57,270
I mean what else have,
has anyone done something this brazen?

645
00:27:57,271 --> 00:27:59,700
Committing an ongoing massacre for a
month straight.

646
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:02,640
Just sniping people who are completely
on an armed.

647
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,460
This is insane.
The only thing I can think of that's

648
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:09,660
slightly similar is when Israeli
commandos hijack that boat,

649
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:12,750
there was a flotilla going to Gaza to
bring wheelchairs because they don't

650
00:28:12,751 --> 00:28:15,030
allow wheelchairs in.
That can be construed as a weapon.

651
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:17,010
Even though there's done tons of
amputees.

652
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:21,420
There was a boat going with aid workers
and they were bringing aid supplies and

653
00:28:21,421 --> 00:28:25,170
commandos jumped on the ship like
helicopter down and just started

654
00:28:25,171 --> 00:28:30,171
executing like people humanitarians that
we're going to bring Gaza aid.

655
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,390
And the news made it seem like there
were,

656
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,010
they were like,
look at these people on the boat,

657
00:28:35,011 --> 00:28:37,470
like hitting them with chairs and stuff.
It's like,

658
00:28:37,471 --> 00:28:40,410
dude,
they fucking propelled onto the boat and

659
00:28:40,411 --> 00:28:42,810
started executing people.
Of course you're going to use whatever

660
00:28:42,811 --> 00:28:44,970
you can to try to like ward off these
soldiers.

661
00:28:44,971 --> 00:28:47,880
So that's the only other thing and that,
and that really woke me up to the whole

662
00:28:47,881 --> 00:28:51,480
situation is when I saw how the media
was covering that massacre.

663
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,690
So now seeing this,
um,

664
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,770
I don't know how they're getting away
with it.

665
00:28:55,771 --> 00:28:58,080
I don't know how people have not woken
up to this,

666
00:28:58,081 --> 00:29:00,810
but the media,
the way that they're covering it is

667
00:29:00,811 --> 00:29:03,810
atrocious.
They're saying there's clashes there

668
00:29:03,811 --> 00:29:06,000
saying that the Palestinians are dying
of head wounds.

669
00:29:06,001 --> 00:29:06,391
It's like,
no,

670
00:29:06,391 --> 00:29:09,000
just say that they were executed with
sniper scopes.

671
00:29:09,001 --> 00:29:10,710
Like this is deliberate.
Um,

672
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,550
but the way that the media plays around
and uses this passive voice is just not

673
00:29:14,551 --> 00:29:17,000
just whether it's Palestine,
Venezuela's,

674
00:29:17,001 --> 00:29:19,020
Syria.
Whenever you have like complete,

675
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:22,860
complete media uniformity,
just peddling align,

676
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,560
probably the truth is somewhere on the
other side,

677
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,810
what is,
what is Israel want?

678
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,450
But as a state,
like what do they want from the

679
00:29:32,451 --> 00:29:34,220
Palestinians?
What do they expect?

680
00:29:34,221 --> 00:29:37,880
They expect to just keep the status quo.
Keep business going as usual.

681
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:40,070
Never let those people live a normal
life.

682
00:29:40,071 --> 00:29:42,250
Like what did,
what do they and why do they have so

683
00:29:42,251 --> 00:29:45,490
much hate and why?
Why haven't the Israeli people like

684
00:29:45,491 --> 00:29:47,590
seeing the horrors of this and rebelled?

685
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,960
Well,
to be a leftist in Israel,

686
00:29:49,961 --> 00:29:51,190
it's,
it's difficult.

687
00:29:51,191 --> 00:29:53,500
And to be an anti Zionist,
it's even more difficult because you're

688
00:29:53,501 --> 00:29:56,920
rejecting your entire,
like I know religion as well as your

689
00:29:56,921 --> 00:29:58,090
political identity.
Look,

690
00:29:58,091 --> 00:29:59,890
it's a settler colonial state,
just like,

691
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,210
um,
a lot of other,

692
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,680
uh,
things in,

693
00:30:02,681 --> 00:30:04,600
in the past.
But this is different because it's

694
00:30:04,601 --> 00:30:06,880
ongoing.
And ever since the inception of Israel

695
00:30:06,881 --> 00:30:09,940
to today,
the colonizers who colonized that land

696
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,500
always knew that there was an indigenous
Arab population that they wanted to kill

697
00:30:14,501 --> 00:30:15,720
or expel.
Um,

698
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,970
and that's still the goal.
Like from Ben Gurion himself,

699
00:30:18,971 --> 00:30:20,620
the,
the original,

700
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:22,090
you know,
prime minister of Israel.

701
00:30:22,091 --> 00:30:24,120
I mean,
he said there's so many Arabs here when

702
00:30:24,121 --> 00:30:25,930
you do expel them and take them there
places.

703
00:30:25,931 --> 00:30:28,630
So it was never a land without a people
and a people without a land.

704
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:32,740
It was always overrun with Arabs and
they've always just wanted to expel the

705
00:30:32,741 --> 00:30:36,310
indigenous population so they can have
an ethno supremacist state.

706
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,440
And that's really what it,
what it is.

707
00:30:38,441 --> 00:30:39,910
And that's how can you be,
I'm sorry,

708
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,300
but can you be a Muslim and live in
Israel?

709
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:45,190
Can you be a Muslim and live in
Jerusalem?

710
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:46,000
Yeah.
But you,

711
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,670
but there's so many discriminatory laws
that are,

712
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:52,330
that basically it's an apartheid state
for non Jews.

713
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:54,280
Like in what way?
Like what are the laws that,

714
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,140
um,
I mean there,

715
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,560
there's so many things that,
that people can check out,

716
00:30:59,561 --> 00:31:01,600
but um,
I would really recommend the work of

717
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:06,690
[inaudible] and Ronny Bark in there to
anti Zionist Israeli born Jews who have

718
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:09,300
extensively talked about this.
Um,

719
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:09,971
but I mean,
just,

720
00:31:09,971 --> 00:31:12,640
just in the roads,
like there's settler only roads compared

721
00:31:12,641 --> 00:31:14,390
to Palestinian only.
Yeah.

722
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:17,220
Compared to Palestinian roads.
People have different license plates,

723
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,970
you have different ID cards.
Um,

724
00:31:18,971 --> 00:31:22,630
so if you are segregated schools,
like just all that stuff.

725
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:24,430
So you can't go to regular school.
No,

726
00:31:24,431 --> 00:31:25,120
you can,
but,

727
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:29,050
but it's so segregated and hostile and
you're so indoctrinated from an early

728
00:31:29,051 --> 00:31:33,640
age to basically hate these people and
think of them as the other.

729
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,530
And,
and I encourage everyone to check out

730
00:31:35,531 --> 00:31:38,530
interviews that I did with,
with just average Israelis in the

731
00:31:38,531 --> 00:31:43,270
streets because the genocidal rhetoric
is very apparent and it's very open and

732
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,950
these people weren't talking to anybody
right now.

733
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,120
Sure.
Yeah.

734
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:47,920
Checkout Abby Martin,
uh,

735
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,230
Israelis,
candid,

736
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:51,560
candid interview with Shirley.

737
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:55,560
One Opinion of that situation before you
went there and then a different one

738
00:31:55,561 --> 00:31:56,580
after you came back.

739
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,300
Well,
I didn't even know what Palestine was

740
00:31:58,301 --> 00:32:01,090
until I was 18 years old.
So when people say,

741
00:32:01,091 --> 00:32:02,470
Oh,
you're only telling us one side of the

742
00:32:02,471 --> 00:32:02,891
story,
look,

743
00:32:02,891 --> 00:32:07,030
I didn't know the Palestine side of the
story until I was an adult,

744
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,840
which really you should say something
about our education system and our media

745
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:13,690
when you completely obfuscate an entire
reality.

746
00:32:13,691 --> 00:32:16,900
And our only told one side.
Um,

747
00:32:16,901 --> 00:32:17,940
but before I went there,
I,

748
00:32:17,941 --> 00:32:19,120
I,
I,

749
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:21,250
you know,
I had a conception of what it was,

750
00:32:21,251 --> 00:32:24,550
but once you go,
you really see how much worse it is.

751
00:32:24,551 --> 00:32:26,980
So this is really party approves
annexation plan.

752
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:27,581
Um,
sorry,

753
00:32:27,581 --> 00:32:28,810
I lost it.
Um,

754
00:32:28,811 --> 00:32:29,890
is this the yeah.
Yeah.

755
00:32:29,891 --> 00:32:33,760
So go to coerce Palestinian departure.
Yeah.

756
00:32:33,761 --> 00:32:36,420
Go,
go forward like a a minute or two.

757
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:40,610
Go forward.
Two minutes.

758
00:32:40,611 --> 00:32:43,520
Yeah.
These people after this,

759
00:32:43,521 --> 00:32:44,930
keep going.
Keep going.

760
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:48,170
And what do you ask you?
Okay,

761
00:32:48,171 --> 00:32:49,260
this is good too.
Okay.

762
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,910
So,
so I got to start playing here.

763
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,380
Um,
so I,

764
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:55,110
this is the thing and also the stand
with us.

765
00:32:55,111 --> 00:32:56,940
People in the Israeli lobby basically
said,

766
00:32:56,941 --> 00:32:58,410
oh,
you cherry picked these interviews.

767
00:32:58,411 --> 00:33:00,510
You only picked like genocidal people to
talk to you.

768
00:33:00,511 --> 00:33:03,270
What the hell you're talking about.
I was in Jerusalem as a place called

769
00:33:03,271 --> 00:33:05,460
tolerance square is a bustling shopping
area.

770
00:33:05,461 --> 00:33:08,940
I spoke to people from all backgrounds,
all walks of life and I just asked them

771
00:33:08,941 --> 00:33:10,620
very simple questions.
What does it like to live here?

772
00:33:10,621 --> 00:33:11,830
How do you deal with the,
you know,

773
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:13,350
problems.
Um,

774
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:18,060
and basically they just were very,
very readily like comfortable to tell me

775
00:33:18,061 --> 00:33:22,110
very crazy genocidal things on camera.
Like no thinking that that would

776
00:33:22,111 --> 00:33:24,450
actually look good for an American
audience.

777
00:33:24,451 --> 00:33:26,090
So keep that in mind out.

778
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:29,480
A lot of people are sympathizing with
the Palestinian plight.

779
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:31,340
Um,
can you talk about what it's like to

780
00:33:31,341 --> 00:33:32,780
kind of live in this situation?

781
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,670
Uh,
first of all it's very hard.

782
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:42,170
I also am an er visit or good position.
It's cooled lava against the Jews

783
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:48,240
shouldn't marry Arabs called it.
Did you say the organization was,

784
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:50,670
did what again,
we,

785
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,630
there,
there is the,

786
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:57,390
the thing of it is tone.
The Jews shouldn't marry Arabs shouldn't

787
00:33:57,391 --> 00:33:59,550
marry Arabs.
Why do you feel strongly about that?

788
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:04,850
Because Jews is his special relation
that God give it to the Jews and Jews to

789
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:08,850
get mixed up together with a different
nation.

790
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:14,370
I think
Israelis I have to take over and uh,

791
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:18,340
they have to kick them or kicked him
away.

792
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:23,240
It will be much better
not to,

793
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:25,220
not to kill them,
just to,

794
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:30,640
to go back to,
to Arab countries as if they didn't lose

795
00:34:30,641 --> 00:34:32,170
their people.
There's no need to try it.

796
00:34:32,171 --> 00:34:35,290
There's no need to talk to them.
What we can do is one that they,

797
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,800
they do enough harm.
We retaliate.

798
00:34:36,801 --> 00:34:38,600
That's war.
And that's the situation that any Jew

799
00:34:38,601 --> 00:34:39,770
lives in Israel has to deal with.

800
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,090
Okay.

801
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:48,740
The Arabs,
nobody name and memory

802
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:53,450
obliterated.
It's about to get really crazy.

803
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:58,130
He killed terrorists.
They'd be afraid to cause any more

804
00:34:58,131 --> 00:34:59,930
trouble,
then I'll be fine.

805
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:02,090
There'll be in their villages,
Morgan here,

806
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,500
we don't have to live together and
everything will be just fine.

807
00:35:05,501 --> 00:35:06,160
Yeah.

808
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,010
Every Arab that doing a terrorism
attack,

809
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,450
Eh,
we have to kill him.

810
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:13,480
And not because it's an Arab,
because he's a terrorist.

811
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,600
Think he should,
uh,

812
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:19,620
also kick out the family because it's
all begins with the I saying the,

813
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:22,560
he's wearing a sons of anarchy tee shirt
by the way,

814
00:35:22,561 --> 00:35:24,180
which is just so strange.

815
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:26,360
The kids does,
you know,

816
00:35:26,361 --> 00:35:27,380
it's families.

817
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:32,600
I made that decision.
Okay,

818
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,890
how do you kick out the Arab?

819
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:39,360
They're getting a mini Manila.

820
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,280
Come on,
tell me the words.

821
00:35:41,281 --> 00:35:42,450
I don't know.
She's like,

822
00:35:42,451 --> 00:35:43,770
I don't know.
You can click translate.

823
00:35:43,771 --> 00:35:46,590
She doesn't want to say it Jesse.
Really well.

824
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:51,330
I think we should give them a country.
If you're doing any problem,

825
00:35:51,331 --> 00:35:55,200
you just going there to give them a
country and then it's going to be a war

826
00:35:55,201 --> 00:35:56,490
between countries.
You know,

827
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:59,910
if they gonna throw rockets,
we're going to throw one big one and

828
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,420
done.
I don't think there's any answers.

829
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:07,170
Insane.
There's only one way I would carpet bomb

830
00:36:07,171 --> 00:36:09,510
them.
It's the only,

831
00:36:09,511 --> 00:36:13,950
it's the only way you could deal with it
or try to stop them a different way.

832
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:18,480
It never worked.
You mean all Arabs are Gaza or

833
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:25,530
I I believe that the like,
I hope to believe that are there or not,

834
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:31,080
but I do think they are because I never,
I don't,

835
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:32,820
I don't trust them.
One more thing.

836
00:36:32,821 --> 00:36:36,070
Do you want to coming up and that's the
only way I believe that the only,

837
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,670
the only way is just to stop it
completely.

838
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:44,360
I'm things that day we miserable that
they Arab,

839
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:48,480
he say make it big.
We amen

840
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,710
these terrorists.
A tiny to killer.

841
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:58,060
She's laughing
with friends like,

842
00:36:58,110 --> 00:36:59,230
uh,
all right,

843
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,820
have a good day.
We'll talk about this later.

844
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:04,870
This is reflected in polls.
A lot of people,

845
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:07,510
when you look at Israeli society,
you know,

846
00:37:07,511 --> 00:37:10,270
it started off as kind of a socialist
project with the Kubota is,

847
00:37:10,271 --> 00:37:14,440
and now it's just turned into a fascist,
a supremacist state where Netanyahu

848
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:17,470
reflects the true face of Israel.
Just like trump rep reflects the true

849
00:37:17,471 --> 00:37:18,850
face of,
of this country.

850
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:22,870
And when it's getting too toxic for even
Natalie Portman to be,

851
00:37:22,871 --> 00:37:23,440
uh,
you know,

852
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,620
this ambassador to Israel,
you know that the tide is turning.

853
00:37:26,621 --> 00:37:28,810
But unfortunately there's so much shit
going on.

854
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:32,470
Congress hasn't said anything.
They just totally support this man.

855
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:37,090
And there's weird like bds legislation
trying to criminalize basically descent

856
00:37:37,091 --> 00:37:40,600
where you have contractors in Texas
having to sign clauses,

857
00:37:40,601 --> 00:37:44,230
promise that they won't support boycott
of Israel to in order to rebuild

858
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,100
hurricane homes.

859
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,590
What is bds?
Boycott divestment sanctions.

860
00:37:47,591 --> 00:37:51,330
It's the movement that Palestinians have
asked us to help them to boycott.

861
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:53,290
And,
and that's what Stephen Hawking was all

862
00:37:53,291 --> 00:37:53,740
about.
He,

863
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:54,820
he,
he boycotted,

864
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:56,710
um,
scientific conferences in Tel Aviv.

865
00:37:57,250 --> 00:38:00,580
So this is what we gotta do.
And we have to fight our government to

866
00:38:00,581 --> 00:38:03,400
stop endorsing these massacres in the
atrocities.

867
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:05,650
Obviously this attitude that these
people have,

868
00:38:05,651 --> 00:38:08,770
it's coming from a place and they were
talking about terrorist attacks,

869
00:38:08,771 --> 00:38:11,850
like how many terrorist attacks are
actually happening in Jerusalem or in,

870
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:13,330
in Austria.
You look at,

871
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:15,220
if you look at the breakdown of
terrorist attacks,

872
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:16,990
how many are guns,
soldiers?

873
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,550
And that really gives you an insight.
Look,

874
00:38:18,551 --> 00:38:20,380
these people are being occupied
militarily.

875
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:22,960
The occupation is illegal under
international law.

876
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:27,070
Um,
and resistance is a lot of times

877
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:30,220
acceptable under international law when
you're being illegally occupied.

878
00:38:30,221 --> 00:38:34,810
So you looking at terrorist attacks
against their look,

879
00:38:34,811 --> 00:38:36,250
not many.
Um,

880
00:38:36,251 --> 00:38:38,770
and when you look at the actual amount
of people who,

881
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,860
when you look at those tears of docs and
see how many are against soldiers,

882
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:43,900
like how many stabbing and techs are
against soldiers,

883
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:45,730
the numbers become very different.

884
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:48,860
Don't you think it's a,
it's a bit different in Israel and

885
00:38:48,861 --> 00:38:52,100
they're more unified because the fact
that mandatory military service,

886
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:56,150
it's totally so everyone is,
if soldiers are attacked,

887
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,160
citizens are attacked.
They're all the same thing.

888
00:38:58,161 --> 00:39:00,380
Everyone is a soldier in Israel.
Uh,

889
00:39:00,381 --> 00:39:00,950
essentially,

890
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:01,311
well,
no.

891
00:39:01,311 --> 00:39:04,040
A lot of these are like aren't armed
soldiers that are

892
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:06,350
right.
But I'm saying everyone identifies with

893
00:39:06,351 --> 00:39:08,660
them because they have to do military
time.

894
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:09,540
Yup,
Yup,

895
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:10,010
Yup,
Yup.

896
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:13,370
That's the same thing with South Korea.
There's places that have mandatory

897
00:39:13,371 --> 00:39:15,680
military service.
They have a totally different idea and

898
00:39:15,681 --> 00:39:19,310
concept of nationalism.
So they feel like if,

899
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:22,490
if a military base got attacked in the
United States,

900
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,980
we would think damn soldiers got
attacked.

901
00:39:24,981 --> 00:39:29,420
We wouldn't necessarily think of it the
same way is if say Dallas got attack

902
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:32,750
someone,
a terrorist attack happened in Dallas,

903
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:35,450
we would think of it as an attack on
American citizens.

904
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:39,530
Not just military,
but their military is their citizens

905
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:41,480
because mandatory military service.

906
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,220
Yeah.
And what's really weird is during the

907
00:39:43,221 --> 00:39:47,000
last massacre in Gaza in 2014,
like half of the Israeli soldiers that

908
00:39:47,001 --> 00:39:49,610
died were American.
Because that's what colonial,

909
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,270
that's what the colonial settlers are.
They,

910
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:54,740
they go over there from New Jersey and
they just post up and top of nerve

911
00:39:54,741 --> 00:39:58,550
village and this is what's happening.
I mean it's off of the soldiers that

912
00:39:58,551 --> 00:39:59,900
died.
Where is our consultants?

913
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,420
A lot of them where,
I'm not actually sure about that

914
00:40:02,421 --> 00:40:04,400
statistic,
but I remember a lot where I was like,

915
00:40:04,401 --> 00:40:09,060
why are so many Americans going over
their 17 year olds in joining the IDF?

916
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:12,410
I mean how bizarre is that?
What kind of mentality do you have to

917
00:40:12,411 --> 00:40:16,160
have to move from like a comfortable
suburban Philadelphia to go like move on

918
00:40:16,161 --> 00:40:20,030
top of an Arab village and he's ass.
These Jewish people that are doing this?

919
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:20,610
Yes.
No,

920
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:22,100
that want to go back to the motherland.

921
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:23,240
Yeah,
that's a huge,

922
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:25,280
there's always this desire to go to the
motherland.

923
00:40:25,281 --> 00:40:27,180
Like it's such a tribal thing,
you know,

924
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,930
the purest form of the,
the conflict,

925
00:40:29,931 --> 00:40:32,450
right?
Like that's types the Wailing Wall and

926
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:33,920
yeah.
I mean that's the spot,

927
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:36,440
right?
It's the epicenter of conflict too.

928
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:39,890
That's why it's so sad that so many
Palestinians can ever go to Jerusalem,

929
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:40,900
which is,
uh,

930
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:43,070
one of their holiest sites is there and
their band,

931
00:40:43,071 --> 00:40:46,220
because again,
they're banned from everything.

932
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:48,830
So,
so if you're a Palestinian and you live

933
00:40:48,831 --> 00:40:50,180
in Gaza,
you just,

934
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:52,430
you're just stuck.
You're stuck forever.

935
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:54,470
And that's why these people are like,
people from America,

936
00:40:54,471 --> 00:40:55,301
they're like,
why that,

937
00:40:55,301 --> 00:40:56,840
you know,
that's why you have this mantra like,

938
00:40:56,841 --> 00:40:57,830
oh,
they want to die.

939
00:40:57,831 --> 00:41:00,470
They raise their kids to be suicide
bombers know when you're in Gaza,

940
00:41:00,471 --> 00:41:04,490
you are born dead.
You don't have a life.

941
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:09,290
So that's why these people are giving up
their lives to send a message to us.

942
00:41:09,291 --> 00:41:11,600
That's why they're doing this.
That's the only reason they're doing

943
00:41:11,601 --> 00:41:14,240
this is to send a message to us,
help us.

944
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:17,030
That's all they can do is use their
bodies.

945
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:21,590
So their concern is if they open up
Gaza,

946
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:26,060
the idea is that if the Palestinians
come and they live in Israel with

947
00:41:26,061 --> 00:41:28,250
everybody else,
that they're just going to cause trouble

948
00:41:28,251 --> 00:41:30,830
and kill people and create suicide
bombs.

949
00:41:30,831 --> 00:41:31,340
And

950
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:32,270
that's,
that's what,

951
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,110
that's what they say.
Even though when I and and and the

952
00:41:36,111 --> 00:41:38,690
Israeli lobby and the stand with us and
all these people have said,

953
00:41:38,691 --> 00:41:39,201
you know,
you're,

954
00:41:39,201 --> 00:41:42,470
you're portraying us as as really
different than we really are cause they

955
00:41:42,471 --> 00:41:45,770
like to portray themselves as peaceful,
loving democratic nation.

956
00:41:45,771 --> 00:41:47,510
And they were like,
Palestinians will say the same thing

957
00:41:47,511 --> 00:41:48,890
about us.
Not True.

958
00:41:48,891 --> 00:41:53,090
I was driving around and subtler plates
in a car that looked like I was a

959
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:58,070
colonial settler.
I did not hear one person say anything

960
00:41:58,071 --> 00:42:00,280
remotely.
Genocidal about Jewish people I talked

961
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:02,440
to you look like cheesy.
Yeah,

962
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:04,430
you could fit right in.
I fit right in.

963
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:08,600
Just move on top of an Arab village.
I mean it's nuts and thank you for

964
00:42:08,601 --> 00:42:12,290
letting me talk about this because it is
difficult to talk about it and I'm sure

965
00:42:12,291 --> 00:42:16,940
it wasn't easy to get hundreds of of
emails telling you to denounce me and

966
00:42:16,941 --> 00:42:19,220
all that other stuff.
We've been friends for a long time.

967
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:19,991
Yeah,
I know.

968
00:42:19,991 --> 00:42:23,450
Yeah.
I'm not denouncing and you know it's

969
00:42:23,451 --> 00:42:25,760
coming from somewhere coordinated.
But that's a thing.

970
00:42:25,761 --> 00:42:28,070
There's a lot of money behind these
attack campaigns

971
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:32,120
and I understand their perspective.
If they don't have the same experience

972
00:42:32,121 --> 00:42:36,440
that you've had being over there and I
mean there's a lot of people over here

973
00:42:36,441 --> 00:42:40,130
that are extremely loyal to Israel that
have never stepped foot in Israel.

974
00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:41,151
Totally.
You know,

975
00:42:41,151 --> 00:42:44,720
and maybe they haven't experienced what
you've experiment,

976
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:49,580
not maybe most likely.
It's just terrifying to me.

977
00:42:49,581 --> 00:42:51,920
Forget about whether it's Israel or
Palestine,

978
00:42:51,921 --> 00:42:53,150
forget about what it is.
The,

979
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:57,980
the idea that people could be stuck born
stock in this spot and really have no

980
00:42:57,981 --> 00:43:02,981
recourse and not know where to go and
just be thought of by people that live

981
00:43:03,321 --> 00:43:06,710
just a few miles away from you.
You're a subhuman and that the fact that

982
00:43:06,711 --> 00:43:09,260
someone can make that t shirt with one
bullet,

983
00:43:09,261 --> 00:43:12,230
two kills and show a pregnant woman with
cross hairs on her belly.

984
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,420
That scares the shit out of me.
That's,

985
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:16,090
that is Nazi Germany.
I mean the,

986
00:43:16,091 --> 00:43:21,091
the fact that they can understand that
this treatment of the Palestinians in

987
00:43:21,711 --> 00:43:26,570
that tee shirt is essentially the same
way the Nazis were looking at the choose

988
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:30,740
is treating people as the other.
It's a very difficult to understand

989
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:35,741
quality of human psychology is that when
we're in conflict with another nation,

990
00:43:35,751 --> 00:43:39,620
another person,
we think of them as less than us,

991
00:43:39,621 --> 00:43:42,500
like literally less human,
not human.

992
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:45,950
The enemy there,
that thing that we have to stop and it's

993
00:43:45,951 --> 00:43:48,620
been a part of warfare since the
beginning of time.

994
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:51,030
Absolutely.
That's what's so trippy to me about like

995
00:43:51,031 --> 00:43:54,540
the British occupation of Ireland
because these,

996
00:43:54,930 --> 00:43:57,180
I don't know if you've seen that movie,
the wind that shakes the barleys.

997
00:43:57,181 --> 00:44:01,530
Holy Shit.
I mean it's just nuts because I can see

998
00:44:01,830 --> 00:44:03,720
like the conflicts around the world and
you know,

999
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:07,020
the other ism is usually someone who
looks different than you and,

1000
00:44:07,350 --> 00:44:11,010
but this is like all white dudes who
like all speak the same language and

1001
00:44:11,011 --> 00:44:13,350
they're just massacring each other.
Yeah.

1002
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:15,670
I was in Belfast a few years back

1003
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:20,160
show out there and after the show we
went outside and the cars,

1004
00:44:20,161 --> 00:44:23,430
the police cars,
they looked like they were in the

1005
00:44:23,431 --> 00:44:25,620
craziest fucking war zone you'd ever
seen.

1006
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:27,510
The first of all,
the entire thing,

1007
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:31,140
the front of the car was completely
covered in thick steel.

1008
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:34,350
They had this big steel grate over the
windshield.

1009
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:38,850
They are bomb like bomb shielding all
over the car.

1010
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,290
We were looking at the cop car,
we're like,

1011
00:44:40,291 --> 00:44:41,550
what the fuck is this?
Like,

1012
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:44,310
Oh yeah man,
this is when the IRA was bombing.

1013
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:47,400
This is what they did.
They just started setting everything up

1014
00:44:47,401 --> 00:44:50,330
like this.
And we were talking to this driver in

1015
00:44:50,331 --> 00:44:55,260
the driver was explaining to us what it
used to be like when,

1016
00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:58,380
you know,
they were at war and what people had

1017
00:44:58,381 --> 00:45:01,320
done to people that knew him and you
know,

1018
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:04,230
just people that look incredibly similar
to each other.

1019
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:08,400
Again speaking the same language,
just gutting each other in the street,

1020
00:45:08,401 --> 00:45:10,320
torturing each other,
killing each other,

1021
00:45:10,321 --> 00:45:14,670
protestants versus Catholics.
I mean it's that thing that humans do

1022
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:19,910
where they treat an enemy as something
less than them the other and just decide

1023
00:45:21,181 --> 00:45:23,430
that that's the red team and we're the
blue team.

1024
00:45:23,431 --> 00:45:26,310
So fuck them.
That that is a scary,

1025
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:28,560
creepy fucking thing that humans are
capable of.

1026
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:29,401
I'm not really,
yeah,

1027
00:45:29,401 --> 00:45:31,800
I'm confused about the whole religious,
um,

1028
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:35,220
like how it grew into a religious
conflict.

1029
00:45:35,221 --> 00:45:38,340
Because originally it was just the
British colonial overlords,

1030
00:45:38,341 --> 00:45:41,730
like harassing the fucking beating the
hell and raping women to her,

1031
00:45:41,731 --> 00:45:45,360
just Irish and these villages and towns
and you know,

1032
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:50,310
how much can you subjugate other people
and put them in cages like in Gaza or do

1033
00:45:50,311 --> 00:45:53,880
this and harass them and humiliate them
and told they'd do something about it.

1034
00:45:54,510 --> 00:45:56,610
I mean that's just the nature of human
beings.

1035
00:45:56,611 --> 00:45:59,880
You can't cage people well if anybody
wants.

1036
00:46:00,430 --> 00:46:03,800
If you really want peace on earth,
the Wa,

1037
00:46:03,830 --> 00:46:06,510
I mean is that really possible?
First of all,

1038
00:46:06,511 --> 00:46:08,130
right?
There's always a question like we're so

1039
00:46:08,131 --> 00:46:12,690
tribal and people are so committed to
their side and then their team and is it

1040
00:46:12,691 --> 00:46:17,691
ever possible to eliminate all war,
but the first step has got to be you.

1041
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:23,520
We have to be able to identify with
those people and see their plight and

1042
00:46:23,521 --> 00:46:25,560
understand,
put yourself in their position.

1043
00:46:25,561 --> 00:46:28,410
If you are born in Gaza,
if you were born,

1044
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:31,470
you know in Northern Ireland,
in back when the war was going on,

1045
00:46:31,471 --> 00:46:34,440
if you were born and big pickups,
pick a spot where there's a conflict.

1046
00:46:35,550 --> 00:46:38,520
You've got to be able to realize like we
got lucky.

1047
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,020
You got lucky.
We got lucky.

1048
00:46:40,021 --> 00:46:40,860
We live in California.

1049
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:41,700
You've got lucky.
I got lucky.

1050
00:46:41,701 --> 00:46:43,560
I was born in New Jersey.
We got lucky.

1051
00:46:43,561 --> 00:46:45,420
We're not in Gaza.
We got lucky.

1052
00:46:45,421 --> 00:46:47,160
We're not where,
wherever it is,

1053
00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:50,310
wherever the conflict is,
if you can't see that,

1054
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:54,270
if you've blocked off that aspect of
your perception that that is,

1055
00:46:54,271 --> 00:46:59,271
this is a classic trait that human
beings have exhibited since probably the

1056
00:47:01,021 --> 00:47:06,021
beginning of tribal life to be getting
of like organized groups of people

1057
00:47:06,241 --> 00:47:09,560
living together in a community,
fighting against all outsiders and so

1058
00:47:09,561 --> 00:47:14,130
almost like ingrained in our DNA,
the way we stay alive is anybody who is

1059
00:47:14,131 --> 00:47:15,450
outside of us.
Fuck them.

1060
00:47:15,590 --> 00:47:16,350
Well,
like you said,

1061
00:47:16,350 --> 00:47:20,250
we're only two people ago.
Literally like,

1062
00:47:20,310 --> 00:47:22,040
yeah,
that's how crazy.

1063
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:23,430
That's crazy.
Yeah.

1064
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:24,870
Yeah.
Three people to go,

1065
00:47:24,871 --> 00:47:26,500
we had slaves.
Yeah.

1066
00:47:26,730 --> 00:47:29,440
Three people go.
People have to be a hundred it.

1067
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:30,550
Yeah.
That's real.

1068
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,440
I mean that and no one says that.

1069
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:35,200
You know,
they don't look at it like human beings.

1070
00:47:35,390 --> 00:47:37,450
We,
we rely on information,

1071
00:47:37,451 --> 00:47:38,740
right?
We rely on like,

1072
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:39,820
oh,
that's what's going on.

1073
00:47:39,850 --> 00:47:40,683
Oh,
I didn't know.

1074
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,910
You know,
like [inaudible] most of us don't know.

1075
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:45,380
You're just driving in your car or
you're doing your life.

1076
00:47:45,381 --> 00:47:47,560
You,
you're really not getting information

1077
00:47:47,561 --> 00:47:51,190
from all over the globe.
How many people accurately even

1078
00:47:51,191 --> 00:47:56,191
understand why North Korea hates us so
much and what do the amount of fucking

1079
00:47:57,101 --> 00:48:01,480
shit we dropped on them during the war?
20% of their population.

1080
00:48:01,481 --> 00:48:02,920
Yeah.
Percent.

1081
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,930
Imagine millions of Americans is that,
and we're like,

1082
00:48:05,970 --> 00:48:07,400
ah,
that Wacky Kim John Boone,

1083
00:48:07,410 --> 00:48:09,340
he's fucking haircut.
You hear what he did?

1084
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:12,010
He's crazy.
He has Dennis Rodman comes over there.

1085
00:48:12,011 --> 00:48:13,900
They played basketball.
I mean,

1086
00:48:13,901 --> 00:48:17,980
that's literally most people,
that's the extent of their understanding

1087
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:20,260
of why North Korea distrust the United
States.

1088
00:48:20,830 --> 00:48:25,060
After we decimated the entire country,
all the infrastructure drop napalm over

1089
00:48:25,061 --> 00:48:27,400
the entire country where we actually
retreated only because there was no

1090
00:48:27,401 --> 00:48:28,930
infrastructure left to bomb.

1091
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,760
And for the past,
I don't know,

1092
00:48:30,761 --> 00:48:33,100
70 years,
North Korea has literally been building

1093
00:48:33,101 --> 00:48:37,720
up defenses to,
to prepare for the next time that they

1094
00:48:37,721 --> 00:48:39,100
know that that will happen.
And we're like,

1095
00:48:39,101 --> 00:48:40,120
oh my God,
there's the one,

1096
00:48:40,121 --> 00:48:42,490
I'm crazy.
Look at this crazy military fascist

1097
00:48:42,491 --> 00:48:43,031
state.
It's like,

1098
00:48:43,031 --> 00:48:44,620
well,
I mean,

1099
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:46,420
there's a reason behind all these
things.

1100
00:48:46,421 --> 00:48:49,510
They don't happen in a vacuum.
I was reading an article today about how

1101
00:48:49,511 --> 00:48:54,511
their nuclear test site is imploding.
Like they've blown up so much over there

1102
00:48:54,731 --> 00:48:58,060
that the fucking grounds caving and
they're opening up a portal of the hell.

1103
00:48:58,390 --> 00:49:00,610
Like,
I like to blow a hole through the earth,

1104
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:03,640
but something really good could come out
of it with the peace talks,

1105
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:06,760
president moon of South Korea and Kim
Jong noon.

1106
00:49:06,761 --> 00:49:08,980
And now trump is forced to,
to jump on board.

1107
00:49:08,981 --> 00:49:11,960
And if trump can can pull this off,
then more power to them.

1108
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:13,990
Man,
that's gotta be so strange to North

1109
00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:16,000
Koreans and South Koreans looking
exactly the same,

1110
00:49:16,001 --> 00:49:18,640
staring at each other across the lawn.
You know,

1111
00:49:18,641 --> 00:49:21,310
back when I was competing and taekwondo,
it was,

1112
00:49:21,311 --> 00:49:22,720
uh,
you know,

1113
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:26,460
Koreans are extremely nationalistic and,
uh,

1114
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:29,290
the South Koreans and the North Koreans,
you know,

1115
00:49:29,291 --> 00:49:31,390
they would occasionally compete in North
Korea.

1116
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:33,310
It was,
you know,

1117
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:38,340
it's gotta be so bizarre to think that
if you zigged you for your ancestor

1118
00:49:39,021 --> 00:49:43,750
zigged instead of zagged,
if you were born like 50 miles that way

1119
00:49:43,870 --> 00:49:48,760
you'd be North Korean and you'd be stuck
under the ruling of this fucking wacky

1120
00:49:48,761 --> 00:49:51,550
son.
And instead you're over here making

1121
00:49:51,551 --> 00:49:53,290
Samsung phones,
you know?

1122
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,240
Well,
for the first couple of decades,

1123
00:49:55,241 --> 00:49:59,050
South Korea was ruled by dictators who
were just as crazy.

1124
00:49:59,051 --> 00:50:01,060
So this whole like,
oh were we weren't friends with him

1125
00:50:01,061 --> 00:50:02,650
because of him being a dictator.
It's like,

1126
00:50:02,651 --> 00:50:03,221
no,
you're just,

1127
00:50:03,221 --> 00:50:04,090
we're trying to,
you know,

1128
00:50:04,091 --> 00:50:04,541
the whole,
well,

1129
00:50:04,541 --> 00:50:09,541
we supported one side and the side we
supported makes kickass electronics and

1130
00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:11,890
they're addicted to plastic surgery.

1131
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:14,500
Have you seen what they're doing with
women's eyes over there?

1132
00:50:14,501 --> 00:50:16,240
No.
Oh my goodness.

1133
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:21,670
Women in South Korea,
it's so common that they get their eyes

1134
00:50:21,671 --> 00:50:22,990
done.
They get their eyes done,

1135
00:50:22,991 --> 00:50:27,991
like an anime character was like white
and cut their lids cut and pulled up so

1136
00:50:29,931 --> 00:50:34,931
that they have these giant Western eyes
but exaggerated and it's so common that

1137
00:50:36,051 --> 00:50:39,020
it like if you didn't know any better,
you would think that this is like,

1138
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:44,140
oh well some people look like this.
There's so much plastic surgery over

1139
00:50:44,511 --> 00:50:48,050
there that it's extremely common for
these women to get these weird fucking

1140
00:50:48,051 --> 00:50:49,060
eyes.
Jamie CD,

1141
00:50:49,061 --> 00:50:52,010
you pull it up because uh,
this is something that I became aware

1142
00:50:52,011 --> 00:50:54,170
of.
She's is,

1143
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:57,860
I want to say like eight or nine years
ago when I was like,

1144
00:50:57,861 --> 00:51:00,170
I just thought it was just a girl that
looked like that.

1145
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:03,830
Like that's not even a good example that
that girl still looks Asian.

1146
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:07,380
That's a boy.
Like look what they're doing there.

1147
00:51:07,381 --> 00:51:11,540
They're westernizing their eyes,
but there's some,

1148
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:13,640
there's some really good,
that guy got his job done.

1149
00:51:13,641 --> 00:51:16,460
He looks better on the right now.
Like that one.

1150
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:19,070
That's a good example.
You see what they're doing.

1151
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:22,820
It's like they're doing this strange
thing with their eyes or their making

1152
00:51:22,821 --> 00:51:24,560
their eyes larger.
Yeah.

1153
00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:28,090
But it's extremely common and whitening
cream is,

1154
00:51:29,530 --> 00:51:30,630
yeah,
see they're,

1155
00:51:30,631 --> 00:51:34,220
they're changing their eyes before,
after.

1156
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:35,271
Yay.
Look,

1157
00:51:35,271 --> 00:51:37,760
that's so much more eye lashes.
Well,

1158
00:51:37,910 --> 00:51:40,380
I wonder what was going on.
I see this girl.

1159
00:51:40,381 --> 00:51:41,290
That's painful.
Yeah,

1160
00:51:41,330 --> 00:51:44,000
I'm sure it sucks,
but afterwards she gets so much more

1161
00:51:44,001 --> 00:51:44,834
Dick.

1162
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:48,770
I mean it's,
I wonder,

1163
00:51:48,830 --> 00:51:52,580
first of all,
I wonder why genetically their eyes are

1164
00:51:52,581 --> 00:51:54,680
like that.
That's interesting to think of like

1165
00:51:54,681 --> 00:51:57,620
what,
like we know that the reason why people

1166
00:51:57,621 --> 00:52:01,820
in England and Ireland and in this
northern climates like why they became

1167
00:52:01,821 --> 00:52:04,010
so pale,
they became so pale because they had a

1168
00:52:04,011 --> 00:52:06,280
very strong lack of vitamin D because
there was no sun,

1169
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:08,930
the air.
So there they basically like a reflector

1170
00:52:08,931 --> 00:52:11,810
for the sun.
They tried to absorb as much sun as

1171
00:52:11,811 --> 00:52:16,280
possible because they live in this
cloudy area as opposed to our great,

1172
00:52:16,281 --> 00:52:18,440
great ancestors lived in Africa.
And that's,

1173
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:22,730
that's literally why white people exist.
We're just Africans with the lack of

1174
00:52:22,731 --> 00:52:25,370
vitamin D.
So racism as a construct.

1175
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:26,870
Oh fuck.
Most certainly is.

1176
00:52:26,871 --> 00:52:28,550
But it's also observable,
right?

1177
00:52:28,570 --> 00:52:32,390
Like,
like there's a clear ancestral origin to

1178
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:36,410
certain body types and diets.
Like there's certain people that live in

1179
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:39,830
parts of West Africa,
they're just fucking phenomenal runners

1180
00:52:39,831 --> 00:52:43,400
and there's no denying that there's
certain traits that people have that you

1181
00:52:43,401 --> 00:52:44,360
can clearly say.

1182
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:46,580
I think the real problem is when we say
race,

1183
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:49,160
like the real prime and then that gets
us tribal again.

1184
00:52:49,161 --> 00:52:52,310
That's us versus them again,
because it's just humans.

1185
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:55,250
It's just humans that that's there.
It's one race.

1186
00:52:55,400 --> 00:53:00,400
But humans that live in high altitude
climates that are much more adapted to

1187
00:53:01,131 --> 00:53:05,390
low oxygen environments.
Humans that live in like the inuits that

1188
00:53:05,391 --> 00:53:08,510
live in extreme cold climates and have
no access to vegetables,

1189
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:11,570
they adapt to this specific fat rich
diet.

1190
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:16,720
Their hands are less likely to get cold.
They actually developed like a genetic

1191
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,220
predisposition to,
uh,

1192
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:22,820
for their,
their ability to withstand cold with

1193
00:53:22,821 --> 00:53:24,740
their hands.
Like we would go over there and we

1194
00:53:24,741 --> 00:53:26,150
fucking,
our hands would be normally

1195
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:26,461
be like,
fuck,

1196
00:53:26,461 --> 00:53:26,761
fuck,
fuck,

1197
00:53:26,761 --> 00:53:27,091
fuck,
fuck,

1198
00:53:27,091 --> 00:53:27,690
fuck,
fuck.

1199
00:53:27,690 --> 00:53:29,520
And they would just be like playing
piano and shit.

1200
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,650
Like it wouldn't even bother them like
this.

1201
00:53:31,651 --> 00:53:32,730
This is genetic.
I mean,

1202
00:53:32,731 --> 00:53:34,260
this is because their bodies have
adapted.

1203
00:53:34,290 --> 00:53:37,980
But there one race,
it's just humans are malleable.

1204
00:53:37,981 --> 00:53:40,190
We're super flexible,
you know?

1205
00:53:40,191 --> 00:53:42,000
And we could,
you could see that in your lifetime,

1206
00:53:42,001 --> 00:53:42,391
right?
I mean,

1207
00:53:42,391 --> 00:53:45,360
if someone works out,
they develop more muscle that gets

1208
00:53:45,361 --> 00:53:47,880
stronger.
And then there's the concept of

1209
00:53:47,881 --> 00:53:50,520
epigenetics and the,
the possibility that some of these

1210
00:53:50,521 --> 00:53:54,150
traits and some of these learned
behaviors you're passing onto your

1211
00:53:54,151 --> 00:53:56,790
children through genes.
So you see an animal planet.

1212
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:00,120
What do we mean the,
what is it a show?

1213
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:02,070
It's a show that it shows how,
um,

1214
00:54:02,310 --> 00:54:05,760
animals and the symbiotic relationship
between humans and animals.

1215
00:54:05,761 --> 00:54:09,300
It's really insane.
And there's a whole [inaudible] section,

1216
00:54:09,301 --> 00:54:10,440
but there's like,
you know,

1217
00:54:10,441 --> 00:54:15,441
tribes and the jungle and stuff who will
work with birds to get beehives and the

1218
00:54:15,661 --> 00:54:17,460
birds will get the reward and get some
money.

1219
00:54:17,470 --> 00:54:19,260
And then if you,
and then if you don't give them any

1220
00:54:19,261 --> 00:54:20,760
honey,
then they'll trick you and take you to

1221
00:54:20,761 --> 00:54:22,240
like,
I'm not beehive tree.

1222
00:54:22,241 --> 00:54:23,430
I mean there's just,
it's just nuts.

1223
00:54:23,431 --> 00:54:28,431
And then helping humans fish and man
blue planet two is also fuck fucking

1224
00:54:29,881 --> 00:54:31,430
nominal.
You have.

1225
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:32,460
You would love it,
dude.

1226
00:54:33,030 --> 00:54:35,250
There's an optimist who makes a sea
shell suit.

1227
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:39,090
He literally makes it suit of armor out
of shells to block themselves from a

1228
00:54:39,091 --> 00:54:40,890
shark.
It's nuts.

1229
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:42,650
One super nuts.
Yeah.

1230
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:44,130
Animals are huge.
I mean,

1231
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:45,810
they're weird and we're,
we're,

1232
00:54:45,811 --> 00:54:48,300
we're animals.
We don't like to think we are because we

1233
00:54:48,301 --> 00:54:51,330
can talk and sing songs and Shit and get
her eyes done,

1234
00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:55,560
but we're,
we're animals and some sort of strange

1235
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:57,270
way.
We're the same as trump.

1236
00:54:57,870 --> 00:55:00,160
Yeah.
Do you see the big boxy suits somehow?

1237
00:55:00,210 --> 00:55:01,740
He's got a good ass Taylor man.

1238
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:03,030
Well,
look,

1239
00:55:03,031 --> 00:55:06,300
obese is the trump statute.
Jamie and I were talking about it

1240
00:55:06,301 --> 00:55:08,610
yesterday in the,
which was it?

1241
00:55:08,611 --> 00:55:11,970
The presidential house of wax or some
show?

1242
00:55:11,971 --> 00:55:14,100
No.
Does anyone please tell me it's bad.

1243
00:55:14,130 --> 00:55:16,160
It's crazy.
It's like punking him.

1244
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:17,430
No Way.
That's great.

1245
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:19,770
Do you ever seen a little bit,
let me look at it though.

1246
00:55:19,771 --> 00:55:22,140
Good.
Make that larger so he could see what it

1247
00:55:22,141 --> 00:55:24,600
looks like.
Operation Fuck trump.

1248
00:55:25,050 --> 00:55:27,600
Trump debuts at Disney world,
but I'm telling you,

1249
00:55:27,601 --> 00:55:29,490
it doesn't look anything like him.
Like,

1250
00:55:29,491 --> 00:55:30,750
if I was the person who created,
look,

1251
00:55:30,751 --> 00:55:32,730
look,
that's George Washington seems normal.

1252
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:34,710
But look at the trump one.
Wait,

1253
00:55:34,711 --> 00:55:36,180
like,
what in the fuck is that?

1254
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:39,280
It doesn't look anything like him.
Oh God,

1255
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:41,440
look at it.
So to Jamie,

1256
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,760
he looks like he's like 20 years older
than he is.

1257
00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:47,880
Doesn't even look like him.
I mean whoever that artist is like he's

1258
00:55:47,881 --> 00:55:50,610
gotta be punking him is,
this is no way.

1259
00:55:50,610 --> 00:55:55,200
He liked did some weird shit to his jaw.
His jaws like extended and creepy.

1260
00:55:55,201 --> 00:55:57,900
He made his neck skin is the same
artists that did the Chris John Rowe,

1261
00:55:57,901 --> 00:55:59,550
not Chris Johnno,
Renaldo,

1262
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:00,720
uh,
bust.

1263
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,600
You saw that right?
He looks pretty much the same.

1264
00:56:03,601 --> 00:56:07,980
And so you didn't find a photo of it
because in high res photos is a low res

1265
00:56:07,981 --> 00:56:10,320
video.
It's difficult to see how shitty it is.

1266
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:13,110
But it's so shitty that it looks fake.
Like,

1267
00:56:13,111 --> 00:56:15,010
like no,
this is not really the one.

1268
00:56:15,110 --> 00:56:15,810
No.
The one,

1269
00:56:15,810 --> 00:56:18,690
they fucking commissioned an artist and
this is the artist's creation.

1270
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:21,830
Whereas this animatronic wax museum,
I don't know,

1271
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:25,810
but I'm going over is in Disney world,
Disney land.

1272
00:56:25,870 --> 00:56:28,410
So inbred looking.
Um,

1273
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:29,710
do you think they,
you're looking bread.

1274
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:32,020
Eric Trump.
He looks odd.

1275
00:56:32,090 --> 00:56:34,830
He looks like he has no upper like look
at that.

1276
00:56:35,050 --> 00:56:36,130
Come on.
Oh my God.

1277
00:56:36,131 --> 00:56:38,190
That's what we're talking him.
Good.

1278
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:41,620
But either way,
good or bad.

1279
00:56:41,830 --> 00:56:45,200
This is clearly a little bow.
Does that if Hillary,

1280
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:47,130
no,
do not tell me that.

1281
00:56:47,330 --> 00:56:48,430
No.
Okay.

1282
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:50,860
This is the fire.
This guy who did the Obama one,

1283
00:56:50,861 --> 00:56:52,480
this terrible.
They just saw I could do better than

1284
00:56:52,481 --> 00:56:53,830
that.
And that's fucking knocked off wax

1285
00:56:53,831 --> 00:56:54,664
museum.

1286
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:59,330
Look how bad that is.
If it doesn't look anything like him.

1287
00:56:59,570 --> 00:57:04,200
Oh God.
It's great that they can do like Jeff

1288
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:07,510
for sin and Lincoln and all that stuff.
Cause all they had was drawings.

1289
00:57:08,030 --> 00:57:09,760
No,
terrible.

1290
00:57:09,790 --> 00:57:10,623
Yeah,
it's pretty bad.

1291
00:57:11,230 --> 00:57:12,880
I don't know how we got onto that.
Oh,

1292
00:57:12,881 --> 00:57:15,020
humans malleable humans.
Yeah.

1293
00:57:15,490 --> 00:57:17,170
I mean,
I'm hoping,

1294
00:57:17,830 --> 00:57:21,070
you know,
just like slavery doesn't exist anymore

1295
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:22,150
in the United States,
at least.

1296
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:27,010
I'm hoping that as time goes on there's
going to be less tribalism and that as

1297
00:57:27,011 --> 00:57:30,180
human beings are able to freely travel
and communicate with each other,

1298
00:57:30,190 --> 00:57:31,480
we're going to be dealing with less of
this.

1299
00:57:31,481 --> 00:57:35,020
But isn't it sad that it seems like it's
almost getting worse even though we have

1300
00:57:35,021 --> 00:57:36,850
all the information available at our
fingertips,

1301
00:57:36,851 --> 00:57:39,430
we're still like,
we just elected someone who basically

1302
00:57:39,431 --> 00:57:43,210
got famous politically because he said
Obama was a secret Muslim and Kenyon

1303
00:57:43,310 --> 00:57:45,860
people love hearing that Shit.
They love hearing that shit and they

1304
00:57:45,861 --> 00:57:47,840
don't want to hear anything differently.
Do you know what's going on right now?

1305
00:57:47,841 --> 00:57:50,280
But she yeti coolers and the NRA?
No.

1306
00:57:50,570 --> 00:57:55,550
It's fascinating because this just shows
how tribal and crazy people get yeti

1307
00:57:55,551 --> 00:57:58,400
coolers.
They canceled some,

1308
00:57:58,430 --> 00:58:03,430
they had these programs like go to go
to,

1309
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:06,220
uh,
do you know my friend Ben O'brien's

1310
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:07,760
instagram?
Do you know that?

1311
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:10,660
Yeah,
I put it on Adam Green trees and we'll,

1312
00:58:10,661 --> 00:58:11,660
we'll,
we could read it,

1313
00:58:11,990 --> 00:58:13,340
but what,
what Yeti did,

1314
00:58:13,341 --> 00:58:17,240
they discontinued these Africa,
what they,

1315
00:58:17,270 --> 00:58:19,670
the way they describe,
describe the program,

1316
00:58:19,970 --> 00:58:24,970
but they had a bunch of outdated um,
incentive programs where like,

1317
00:58:25,451 --> 00:58:26,990
you know,
like if you signed up for something and

1318
00:58:26,991 --> 00:58:28,730
get a discount,
like a discounted program,

1319
00:58:28,731 --> 00:58:31,810
here it is,
this cow outdated discounting program

1320
00:58:31,811 --> 00:58:36,740
and Yeti makes super high end coolers.
They're like really expensive,

1321
00:58:36,741 --> 00:58:39,350
but they literally will keep ice for
days.

1322
00:58:39,590 --> 00:58:43,460
You could put ice in them and go to the
desert and five days later you have ice

1323
00:58:43,461 --> 00:58:46,800
in that cooler.
And I'm not bullshit fucking phenomenon.

1324
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:49,580
That's exactly what to do with it.
Phenomenal.

1325
00:58:49,581 --> 00:58:52,850
So anyway,
they notified the NRA and the

1326
00:58:52,851 --> 00:58:55,490
organization has changed.
Getty explained to them that they're

1327
00:58:55,491 --> 00:58:59,450
offering an alternative customization
program broadly available to consumers

1328
00:58:59,451 --> 00:59:01,910
and organizations,
including the NRA foundation.

1329
00:59:02,570 --> 00:59:07,570
So then the NRA releases this statement
that Yeti coolers doesn't want to work

1330
00:59:08,301 --> 00:59:10,310
with the NRA anymore.
They don't support the second

1331
00:59:10,311 --> 00:59:13,430
amendment's of fuck them.
So people start blowing up their yeti

1332
00:59:13,431 --> 00:59:16,860
coolers.
Just like that Karen coffee maker,

1333
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:20,690
they filled the Yeti coolers up with
that thermite shit.

1334
00:59:20,691 --> 00:59:22,100
Or what did,
what does that stuff not thermite?

1335
00:59:22,210 --> 00:59:25,760
What's that explosion of Shit?
Stephen Paddock had a bunch of that shit

1336
00:59:25,761 --> 00:59:26,690
in his car.
Um,

1337
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:30,500
what does that cricket not whatever the
day is that what it is?

1338
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:32,720
And yeti support is blown up.
Yeti coolers.

1339
00:59:32,750 --> 00:59:33,583
Yes.
It's all done.

1340
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:38,550
Let's look at [inaudible]
coolers.

1341
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:40,340
You can suck my Dick.
I'm American.

1342
00:59:40,550 --> 00:59:43,100
So they filled it out with this
explosive shit.

1343
00:59:43,310 --> 00:59:45,980
And by the way,
these coolers are fucking expensive.

1344
00:59:46,190 --> 00:59:51,080
There's super engineered and you know,
they start at like 300 bucks a so this

1345
00:59:51,081 --> 00:59:52,850
is looking at their blow.
This,

1346
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:55,730
I'm telling you,
these people are just looking for an

1347
00:59:55,731 --> 00:59:58,790
excuse to blow shit up.
But there's a great quote in this

1348
00:59:58,791 --> 01:00:00,230
article.
What does this article from,

1349
01:00:00,231 --> 01:00:02,780
what does this website,
this is the Washington Post and nuts.

1350
01:00:02,990 --> 01:00:03,771
Um,
there's,

1351
01:00:03,771 --> 01:00:07,400
there's a great quote in this article
that sort of highlights how fucking

1352
01:00:07,401 --> 01:00:10,810
preposterous this all is.
It's all me.

1353
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:13,360
I don't think it's The Washington Post
babies stability.

1354
01:00:13,370 --> 01:00:14,203
It's good.
God,

1355
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:18,110
but I don't think it's that.
What I really think is that they want an

1356
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:20,120
enemy.
They're happy when something happens.

1357
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:24,230
And even though Yeti's explained,
know their whole fucking business is

1358
01:00:24,231 --> 01:00:28,040
hunters and fishermen and anglers,
they're not anti NRA.

1359
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:31,220
They're definitely not anti second
amendment like fucking relaxed.

1360
01:00:31,430 --> 01:00:33,260
So even after they put out that
statement,

1361
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:36,320
the NRA doubled down and released
another statement.

1362
01:00:36,321 --> 01:00:38,150
You know,
you made a big mistake and now you're

1363
01:00:38,151 --> 01:00:38,984
paying for it.

1364
01:00:41,670 --> 01:00:46,670
I really think we have a real problem
and especially there's a real problem in

1365
01:00:46,791 --> 01:00:50,570
that regard because they need to
understand everybody don't understand

1366
01:00:50,571 --> 01:00:55,571
that we should all anybody that supports
any outdoor activities has to understand

1367
01:00:56,660 --> 01:00:59,690
that the conflict,
if you have any internal conflict

1368
01:00:59,691 --> 01:01:00,501
against each other,
like,

1369
01:01:00,501 --> 01:01:02,810
but the thing about hunters and
fishermen,

1370
01:01:02,811 --> 01:01:06,830
all these people,
what their real opposition is is animal

1371
01:01:06,831 --> 01:01:11,630
rights activists and radical Animal
Liberation Organization type people.

1372
01:01:11,990 --> 01:01:15,200
That's the real enemy.
The enemy isn't Yeti coolers,

1373
01:01:15,201 --> 01:01:19,670
who makes their business selling shit to
hunters and fishermen and anglers.

1374
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:23,750
Like these people are crazy.
So this conflict just shows to me like

1375
01:01:23,990 --> 01:01:26,330
people are just looking for a fight
right?

1376
01:01:26,570 --> 01:01:26,961
Like,
right.

1377
01:01:26,961 --> 01:01:29,540
You know how long it takes to get all
that fucking explosive shit and put it

1378
01:01:29,541 --> 01:01:31,250
in a cooler.
This is just happened.

1379
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:33,280
And these got,
we're ready.

1380
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,980
Camera Ready.
Got To put this up on facebook.

1381
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:42,800
I need to get some likes there.
Boom.

1382
01:01:42,801 --> 01:01:45,110
And they're blowing up these fucking
$300.

1383
01:01:45,111 --> 01:01:48,140
$500 cooler is good.
Easy by and buy him up.

1384
01:01:48,230 --> 01:01:49,190
Yeah.
But now these,

1385
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:51,290
this also is really fascinating.
Yeah.

1386
01:01:51,291 --> 01:01:52,970
I'll,
I'll send this to Jamie because I sent

1387
01:01:52,971 --> 01:01:55,500
it to her friend Ben.
Oh,

1388
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:57,620
Brian,
who's freaking out about this because

1389
01:01:57,621 --> 01:01:58,460
Ben is,
uh,

1390
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:00,320
he's,
he's an executive at Yeti.

1391
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:02,380
My Buddy Ben,
and you know,

1392
01:02:02,750 --> 01:02:05,600
I sent him this thing where all these
other coolers,

1393
01:02:06,030 --> 01:02:08,090
um,
all these other cooler companies are

1394
01:02:08,091 --> 01:02:11,630
freaking out and jumping in and saying,
we are all second.

1395
01:02:11,631 --> 01:02:13,460
It's on deadspin here.
Jamie.

1396
01:02:13,461 --> 01:02:16,070
I'll send it to you right now.
One of these people will kill me.

1397
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:17,840
All these alt right.
I mean,

1398
01:02:17,841 --> 01:02:18,900
I don't know if they're all right.
So I've,

1399
01:02:19,070 --> 01:02:20,100
all right.
A lot of people

1400
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:23,040
who say,
you know liberals are snowflakes and you

1401
01:02:23,041 --> 01:02:23,970
and you cry,
but everything,

1402
01:02:23,971 --> 01:02:24,481
it's like,
dude,

1403
01:02:24,481 --> 01:02:27,720
you guys are literally have built
careers off being victims.

1404
01:02:27,721 --> 01:02:29,040
I mean,
what is happening here?

1405
01:02:29,041 --> 01:02:31,770
I mean I know that this is not exactly
the same thing,

1406
01:02:31,771 --> 01:02:33,420
but it kind of is ridiculous.
Now.

1407
01:02:33,421 --> 01:02:36,220
You think protest,
you throw your care coffee maker out,

1408
01:02:36,470 --> 01:02:38,700
smash it with a bat.
Well that's Sean Hannity.

1409
01:02:38,701 --> 01:02:40,860
He speaks the truth and he's got damn
lippers.

1410
01:02:40,861 --> 01:02:43,710
We'll trying to silence the truth and
I'm not having it from Keurig.

1411
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:45,960
You on a blood cot.
Sean Harris.

1412
01:02:46,250 --> 01:02:49,680
I'm going to point you like the Laura
Ingram thing was fascinating.

1413
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:51,870
Here it is.
Bison coolers.

1414
01:02:51,871 --> 01:02:55,900
Look at these people and we tap lag.
If you have a second amendment supporter

1415
01:02:57,640 --> 01:03:02,160
company,
we love guns and joining the herd it

1416
01:03:02,161 --> 01:03:03,060
says,
look at that.

1417
01:03:03,061 --> 01:03:05,610
Joined the herd.
How about joining the herd?

1418
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:08,700
What?
Join the herd of sheep.

1419
01:03:08,930 --> 01:03:11,310
Fuck.
You're trying to get people to be sheep,

1420
01:03:11,311 --> 01:03:12,600
like join the herd.
What do you,

1421
01:03:12,630 --> 01:03:14,430
why would you say heard or people
cattle.

1422
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:16,980
You write crazy asshole.
Speaking to an audience.

1423
01:03:17,010 --> 01:03:19,290
There's a great quote in that.
Scroll down a little bit,

1424
01:03:19,291 --> 01:03:22,020
Jamie.
Scroll down a little bit because of the

1425
01:03:22,021 --> 01:03:26,370
second amendment like here it is.
Scroll down to scroll down so I could

1426
01:03:26,371 --> 01:03:27,620
read that.
Bottom texts has,

1427
01:03:27,870 --> 01:03:31,560
so here we find ourselves in the midst
of a dumb as rocks arm race between

1428
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:35,610
essentially indistinguishable cooler
blend brands all trying to declare their

1429
01:03:35,611 --> 01:03:39,870
undying devotion to guns more fervently.
Then their rivals.

1430
01:03:39,871 --> 01:03:42,450
The whole shit is exactly as stupid as
it seems.

1431
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:46,890
And amid the fog of marketing bullshit
and bad faith NRA posturing,

1432
01:03:47,010 --> 01:03:52,010
there's one truth that none of this can.
None of this mess can obscure 479 99 is

1433
01:03:52,471 --> 01:03:53,580
too much to pay for a cooler.

1434
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:57,870
I disagree because there's solid fucking
coolers.

1435
01:03:57,930 --> 01:03:58,591
They're,
they're very,

1436
01:03:58,591 --> 01:04:00,120
they're worth it.
If you can keep it here,

1437
01:04:00,121 --> 01:04:04,170
using it for what you're using it.
If you go hunting or camping,

1438
01:04:04,171 --> 01:04:08,150
you can keep fucking dairy important to
me.

1439
01:04:08,151 --> 01:04:10,440
It does.
Oregon's very insanely good coolers.

1440
01:04:10,441 --> 01:04:13,080
But who wrote that article?
Gives our guys fucking hilarious man.

1441
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:15,780
The deadspin author hat trick.
Redford.

1442
01:04:16,090 --> 01:04:19,220
God brought us you Patrick.
Dumb as rocks quote.

1443
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:22,890
Fucking so stupid.
Blown up.

1444
01:04:22,891 --> 01:04:24,660
Cool.
This is what our discourse has become.

1445
01:04:25,050 --> 01:04:27,500
It's like mass hallucinations on both
sides of the political aisle.

1446
01:04:27,501 --> 01:04:29,850
You're either a Russian Bot or a troll
or your,

1447
01:04:29,851 --> 01:04:32,250
everything's fake news and it's all,
you know,

1448
01:04:32,350 --> 01:04:35,170
q and on rapport,
your lip tartar,

1449
01:04:35,171 --> 01:04:36,210
snowflake.
It's,

1450
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:39,150
let's talk about that other thing.
The Q and on thing.

1451
01:04:39,210 --> 01:04:40,980
No,
the guy who blew up,

1452
01:04:40,981 --> 01:04:44,880
or the guy who ran over those,
pia is what is the new word and soul.

1453
01:04:45,270 --> 01:04:47,240
What does the word soul,
soul incent.

1454
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:52,250
Voluntary Celibate.
So people are killing people because now

1455
01:04:52,411 --> 01:04:56,550
bordain was tweeting that there's like
some sort of a rabbit reddit forum with

1456
01:04:56,551 --> 01:04:58,880
all these folks and there's like
$40,000.

1457
01:04:58,881 --> 01:04:59,460
Totally.
Well,

1458
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:02,820
the guy who shot a bunch of women in
Santa Barbara a couple of years ago,

1459
01:05:02,821 --> 01:05:04,410
he was also like,
I'm so attractive.

1460
01:05:04,411 --> 01:05:05,790
Why don't you guys want to have sex with
me?

1461
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:06,870
It's like,
look,

1462
01:05:06,930 --> 01:05:08,670
it doesn't matter what you look like.
There's healthy,

1463
01:05:08,671 --> 01:05:10,950
loving relationships that exist for
everyone.

1464
01:05:11,030 --> 01:05:11,863
Yeah.
He was acuity,

1465
01:05:12,140 --> 01:05:14,040
the little murder.
He was a little cutie.

1466
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:18,100
So it's just crazy when people blame
women in are violent misogynists

1467
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:19,450
because they are,
you know,

1468
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:20,031
um,
on,

1469
01:05:20,031 --> 01:05:21,490
uh,
they think that they're unattractive and

1470
01:05:21,491 --> 01:05:24,460
they're basically just blame,
like attractive women for not having sex

1471
01:05:24,461 --> 01:05:25,750
with them.
It's really disturbing.

1472
01:05:25,751 --> 01:05:29,710
And this guy apparently mowed down a
bunch of people in Toronto because he,

1473
01:05:29,900 --> 01:05:30,900
he was one of these people

1474
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:35,340
insoles creating rules.
And honestly the sickens me what,

1475
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:40,560
this is the uh,
don't go down 70,000,

1476
01:05:40,710 --> 01:05:43,530
70,000 now,
but I think it was 40,000 yesterday.

1477
01:05:43,710 --> 01:05:47,340
So there's like a bunch of goofballs
that just signed up just to,

1478
01:05:47,430 --> 01:05:50,040
just to read to what the fuck's going on
over there.

1479
01:05:50,580 --> 01:05:53,340
Cause people are freaking out with the
idea that okay here it is.

1480
01:05:53,341 --> 01:05:56,190
Insult tears is a place for folks to
submit screenshots,

1481
01:05:56,191 --> 01:05:59,790
not direct links of crazy stuff posted
by self describing Oh okay.

1482
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:02,230
This is,
this is the mocking way.

1483
01:06:02,550 --> 01:06:05,610
There's another one though.
There's another one that bordain was

1484
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:09,120
quoting,
but it's fucking hard out there for a

1485
01:06:09,121 --> 01:06:10,260
pimp.
I get it.

1486
01:06:10,261 --> 01:06:13,860
But don't take a truck and run over a
bunch of civilians cause he can't get

1487
01:06:13,861 --> 01:06:16,830
laid.
Just choose the very classes that teach

1488
01:06:16,831 --> 01:06:18,810
people how to be nice,
so people like them,

1489
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:22,470
man,
like there's those pickup artists type

1490
01:06:22,471 --> 01:06:24,720
guys who do like seminars and how to
pick people up.

1491
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:26,220
Shouldn't it be like like,
Hey,

1492
01:06:26,221 --> 01:06:27,750
this is how it'd be a nice person,
right?

1493
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:30,000
Like this is how you want what you want
a girlfriend.

1494
01:06:30,030 --> 01:06:30,660
Oh,
okay.

1495
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:32,640
We got to be someone that people want to
be with.

1496
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:33,151
Like,
yeah,

1497
01:06:33,151 --> 01:06:34,380
exactly.
How do you do that?

1498
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:36,270
Some people don't know how to do it
right,

1499
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:38,310
but just socially fucked up and

1500
01:06:38,390 --> 01:06:41,150
they live on reddit.
They don't leave their basement and this

1501
01:06:41,151 --> 01:06:43,250
is what comes out of it.
It's really unfortunate.

1502
01:06:43,820 --> 01:06:47,330
They need to interact with normal people
in society and realize that there's some

1503
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:48,680
someone for everyone.
I mean,

1504
01:06:48,740 --> 01:06:49,210
you know,

1505
01:06:49,210 --> 01:06:53,580
not really though.
Maybe there.

1506
01:06:53,581 --> 01:06:55,320
All right.
You got to find an insole.

1507
01:06:55,321 --> 01:06:56,860
Women are there.
There's no insult.

1508
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:58,050
Women.
Women can always get laid,

1509
01:06:58,260 --> 01:07:00,360
right.
There's no such something tells me

1510
01:07:00,361 --> 01:07:01,560
there's no insulin and well,
yeah.

1511
01:07:01,650 --> 01:07:02,670
You know,
I know that.

1512
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:06,030
Yeah.
Did you hear about this term before?

1513
01:07:06,031 --> 01:07:07,950
I did not know about this term before,
no.

1514
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:10,010
How many of these terms are out there
that we don't know about that are going

1515
01:07:10,011 --> 01:07:10,930
to blow up in our face.
Yeah,

1516
01:07:10,980 --> 01:07:11,813
right.

1517
01:07:12,630 --> 01:07:14,610
I mean,
that are going to commit massacres and

1518
01:07:14,611 --> 01:07:17,070
then we're going to have to find out
about some other weird subculture on

1519
01:07:17,071 --> 01:07:20,220
reddit that has been,
there's multiple of them.

1520
01:07:22,710 --> 01:07:25,830
So fucking weird time to be alive.
Like the weirdest,

1521
01:07:25,831 --> 01:07:27,570
I think in really insane.
I mean,

1522
01:07:27,630 --> 01:07:29,820
like I said before,
the mass hallucination is there's no way

1523
01:07:29,821 --> 01:07:34,530
to have actual dialogue or discourse
about reality because you're a Russian

1524
01:07:34,531 --> 01:07:35,600
Bot.
Yeah.

1525
01:07:35,970 --> 01:07:39,090
The liberals have not an a,
and I mean the liberals meaning the Neo

1526
01:07:39,091 --> 01:07:41,220
Liberal,
the think tank establishment that people

1527
01:07:41,221 --> 01:07:43,500
that people call leftists,
which is a misnomer.

1528
01:07:43,501 --> 01:07:46,770
But those people are so in denial about
the fact that trump won,

1529
01:07:46,771 --> 01:07:49,830
that they still just have to blame
Russia for the fact that trump is our

1530
01:07:49,831 --> 01:07:52,080
president.
They can't accept that he won

1531
01:07:52,350 --> 01:07:53,610
democratically.
No.

1532
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:55,710
Um,
so it's really pathetic that now you

1533
01:07:55,711 --> 01:07:59,790
have them suing the DNC over this
erroneous fraudulent lawsuit that's

1534
01:07:59,791 --> 01:08:01,050
basically threatening press freedom.

1535
01:08:01,050 --> 01:08:03,930
They're basically saying,
if you publish leaks,

1536
01:08:04,170 --> 01:08:06,420
including trump's tax returns,
you could even say,

1537
01:08:06,421 --> 01:08:09,120
I mean this is what journalists do.
They publish things that are sure people

1538
01:08:09,121 --> 01:08:11,640
give them.
That's echoing economic espionage,

1539
01:08:11,641 --> 01:08:13,080
they said.
So this is like,

1540
01:08:13,081 --> 01:08:17,000
this has profound implications for press
and it's an incredible how desperate

1541
01:08:17,001 --> 01:08:17,480
they're,
they're,

1542
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:20,210
they're slapping a lawsuit on Julian
assange choose still arbitrarily

1543
01:08:20,211 --> 01:08:23,540
detained in an embassy.
Yeah,

1544
01:08:23,541 --> 01:08:25,250
they cut off his internet.
So how's he get online?

1545
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:26,720
He is not online.
He's,

1546
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:29,000
they basically are trying to force him
out at this point.

1547
01:08:29,570 --> 01:08:32,300
And if they forced him out that just
going to jail him on trumped up charges

1548
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:34,730
because they're trying to get them on
the sex charge.

1549
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:36,470
But hasn't that sex charges been
dropped?

1550
01:08:36,471 --> 01:08:40,220
It was dropped.
There's a lot of weird things about it

1551
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:41,480
initially.
I don't know.

1552
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:42,360
Um,
you know,

1553
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:46,490
all I know is that a son,
they basically said that they could not

1554
01:08:46,491 --> 01:08:49,940
promise that he won't be extradited to
the u s which means they will extradite

1555
01:08:49,941 --> 01:08:51,950
him to the U S and we've already had
palm peo,

1556
01:08:51,951 --> 01:08:54,950
who's the psychotic Koch brothers Shill
who just got appointed.

1557
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:56,113
Um,
said he,

1558
01:08:56,180 --> 01:08:58,910
he wants to basically see Julian assange
go down.

1559
01:08:58,911 --> 01:09:00,800
I mean,
he had harsh words for Julian assange.

1560
01:09:00,801 --> 01:09:03,560
So even though trump talks out of both
sides of his mouth on the campaign,

1561
01:09:03,561 --> 01:09:04,970
he was like,
I love Wiki leaks.

1562
01:09:05,420 --> 01:09:08,090
He is going to prosecute him probably to
save his own ass.

1563
01:09:08,091 --> 01:09:09,410
And it pretend like he,
you know,

1564
01:09:09,470 --> 01:09:10,700
did he say,
I love wikileaks?

1565
01:09:10,790 --> 01:09:12,110
He actually did.
Yeah.

1566
01:09:12,111 --> 01:09:15,380
During the campaign he was like,
Julian Assange Bang and Pamela Anderson.

1567
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:20,990
It looks like he did on Julian hindered.
Pamela Anderson brought him a bunch of

1568
01:09:20,991 --> 01:09:24,250
Chinese food to the crazier it gets
cray.

1569
01:09:24,251 --> 01:09:27,140
She can never fucking Julian his sons.
Yeah.

1570
01:09:27,141 --> 01:09:29,330
Promote Gateway Pundit.
That's disturbing.

1571
01:09:29,390 --> 01:09:30,380
But um,
what does that,

1572
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:31,610
well,
remember the last time I was on,

1573
01:09:31,611 --> 01:09:33,860
you were like,
you brought up the whole pizzagate thing

1574
01:09:33,861 --> 01:09:35,660
and we were talking about,
of Julian assange has been,

1575
01:09:36,020 --> 01:09:37,160
I love Wiki leaks.

1576
01:09:37,190 --> 01:09:41,030
I think that he's trolling,
but it's an irresponsible trolling where

1577
01:09:41,031 --> 01:09:43,220
he's just kind of trying to stir shit.
I mean,

1578
01:09:43,221 --> 01:09:44,540
I don't know.
If I were joining us on,

1579
01:09:44,550 --> 01:09:47,570
who knows how I would feel being pushed
in an embassy.

1580
01:09:47,571 --> 01:09:49,370
And you know,
being arbitrarily detained,

1581
01:09:49,371 --> 01:09:52,880
like kind of not being able to leave,
looking at a shitty wrote.

1582
01:09:53,110 --> 01:09:54,440
Oh,
he must be going crazy.

1583
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:56,630
I mean,
Julian assange literally must be going

1584
01:09:56,631 --> 01:09:57,464
crazy,
right.

1585
01:09:57,880 --> 01:10:00,380
But that the Internet,
the Internet was really what it was

1586
01:10:00,381 --> 01:10:04,310
saving him.
So now that Marino and look at all these

1587
01:10:04,311 --> 01:10:05,060
quotes.
Yeah.

1588
01:10:05,060 --> 01:10:05,580
Yeah,
I know.

1589
01:10:05,580 --> 01:10:07,320
Came out.
Trump said wiki leaks.

1590
01:10:07,321 --> 01:10:08,940
I love Wiki leaks.
Wiki leaks.

1591
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:11,490
I love you.
October,

1592
01:10:11,490 --> 01:10:12,810
2016 the wikileaks stuff,
it's unbelievable.

1593
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:15,540
It tells you the inner heart.
You got to read it.

1594
01:10:15,541 --> 01:10:16,830
It tells you the inner heart.
What?

1595
01:10:16,930 --> 01:10:19,290
This guy just flies by the seat of his
pants.

1596
01:10:19,291 --> 01:10:21,930
So full fucking hilarious.
I know this is prepared.

1597
01:10:22,140 --> 01:10:24,780
It's been amazing.
It's coming from wiki leaks and then

1598
01:10:24,781 --> 01:10:27,270
another one says another one come in
today trump said this.

1599
01:10:27,271 --> 01:10:30,000
Wikileaks is like a treasure trove.
Another one he says,

1600
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:33,090
getting off the plane.
We just announcing new wikileaks and I

1601
01:10:33,091 --> 01:10:37,080
wanted to say there a that,
but I didn't want to keep you waiting.

1602
01:10:37,081 --> 01:10:38,040
Said trump.
Boy,

1603
01:10:38,070 --> 01:10:39,390
I love reading those Wiki.

1604
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:42,280
This is hilarious.
Like let them go.

1605
01:10:42,281 --> 01:10:45,270
Then donald free.
Why don't you uh,

1606
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:47,710
pardon him.
Pardon his ass.

1607
01:10:47,870 --> 01:10:49,110
Well,
why wouldn't he like,

1608
01:10:49,170 --> 01:10:52,720
I don't understand why he was because
he's a bullshitter.

1609
01:10:52,780 --> 01:10:56,340
He's a con artist and he's tricked
everyone into thinking that he's this

1610
01:10:56,341 --> 01:10:59,470
somehow anti deep state
antiestablishment guy and he's not,

1611
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:01,360
um,
and joining us on,

1612
01:11:01,690 --> 01:11:03,220
you know,
if he pardons in and that's,

1613
01:11:03,221 --> 01:11:06,580
that's his undoing I think.
I think if anything he'll prosecute him.

1614
01:11:06,820 --> 01:11:09,760
Where's that girl that accused him of it
was surprise sex.

1615
01:11:10,220 --> 01:11:13,260
That's what she accused him of.
Like they had sex with a condom and in

1616
01:11:13,261 --> 01:11:14,094
the middle of the night

1617
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:17,940
he had sex with her with no condom.
We didn't knock it in.

1618
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:22,950
And in Sweden it's um,
I think they called it soprise sex does

1619
01:11:22,951 --> 01:11:27,951
that a new term.
But I mean,

1620
01:11:28,231 --> 01:11:32,100
how the fuck is that guy going to get
export to the United States because of

1621
01:11:32,101 --> 01:11:34,440
that?
How is he going to get deported sex by

1622
01:11:34,441 --> 01:11:36,900
surprise.
Oh six by surprise.

1623
01:11:36,990 --> 01:11:40,140
Well,
the next honeypot they need editors

1624
01:11:40,141 --> 01:11:41,730
because they should cut out a couple of
words there.

1625
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:43,290
Yeah,
it's insane.

1626
01:11:43,410 --> 01:11:46,290
And meanwhile,
while trump is this like Internet troll

1627
01:11:46,410 --> 01:11:48,510
and he definitely is an Internet troll.
Meanwhile,

1628
01:11:48,511 --> 01:11:53,511
the evangelicals are taking the fuck
over all these fifth circuit court

1629
01:11:53,911 --> 01:11:56,920
judges that trump has appointed.
They're all like from the 16 hundreds

1630
01:11:57,270 --> 01:12:01,380
mentality is like 500 years old.
Like session scares the shit out of him.

1631
01:12:01,381 --> 01:12:03,960
Do sessions.
Devoss pence,

1632
01:12:04,950 --> 01:12:07,500
Palm Peo talks about the rapture all the
time.

1633
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:09,490
When does it come in?

1634
01:12:09,540 --> 01:12:10,800
Does he have a knife?
I don't know man.

1635
01:12:10,801 --> 01:12:13,950
But they're all doing a self fulfilling
prophecy with Bolton at the helm.

1636
01:12:13,951 --> 01:12:16,680
I mean,
Jesus Christ with Bolton and Giuliani

1637
01:12:16,681 --> 01:12:19,860
and Nikki Haley and Paul [inaudible].
He's going to fix it.

1638
01:12:19,890 --> 01:12:22,240
It's going to come in and fix it.
They're deep state outsider.

1639
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:23,870
This,
this mother fucker.

1640
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:26,040
What is he supposed to do?
I don't know.

1641
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:27,810
He's like,
he's supposed to like end the Mueller

1642
01:12:27,811 --> 01:12:29,190
probe and Mueller's like,
yeah,

1643
01:12:29,191 --> 01:12:29,641
yeah,
yeah.

1644
01:12:29,641 --> 01:12:31,320
I'll be,
I'll get right on that bolden.

1645
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:32,310
Shit.
So nuts though.

1646
01:12:32,311 --> 01:12:32,941
Cause it's like,
dude,

1647
01:12:32,941 --> 01:12:36,450
these people were way too crazy to even
be taken seriously during like the Bush

1648
01:12:36,451 --> 01:12:37,051
administration.
I mean,

1649
01:12:37,051 --> 01:12:41,190
they were the most psychotic outliers of
the Islamophobic.

1650
01:12:41,191 --> 01:12:45,180
Neo-Con wings where John Bolton's
writing op eds saying why we need to

1651
01:12:45,181 --> 01:12:47,700
attack North Korea first,
um,

1652
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,550
why we need to bomb Iran bomb bomb bomb
Iran.

1653
01:12:50,551 --> 01:12:55,470
So Giuliani meets with Mueller and tries
to determine if he has an open mind.

1654
01:12:55,550 --> 01:12:57,840
And other headline I just saw says he's
sort of,

1655
01:12:57,990 --> 01:13:01,620
he's meeting with Mueller to see or to
negotiate a interview with trump.

1656
01:13:01,950 --> 01:13:03,660
Ah,
do you remember when?

1657
01:13:03,870 --> 01:13:04,561
Oh,
that's it.

1658
01:13:04,561 --> 01:13:06,120
So he's like the,
the middleman.

1659
01:13:06,510 --> 01:13:08,610
Remember when Giuliani was rocking the
comb over?

1660
01:13:08,611 --> 01:13:10,230
You think he talked to Donald?
Go Donald,

1661
01:13:10,231 --> 01:13:11,310
just shave it.
Look at me.

1662
01:13:11,420 --> 01:13:12,450
Look at me.
Look at me.

1663
01:13:12,451 --> 01:13:16,830
Donald on free corn free Chinese.
Three firms that make your headpiece.

1664
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:18,690
He's got something wacky going on up
there.

1665
01:13:19,190 --> 01:13:21,270
The Taylor man's talking about it.
Call me,

1666
01:13:21,271 --> 01:13:23,400
was saying that it appears to all be
his.

1667
01:13:23,610 --> 01:13:25,260
And he goes,
and I will admit that I,

1668
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:28,620
I gave it a good look
while he was,

1669
01:13:29,190 --> 01:13:32,680
while I was sucking his dick.
You saw the video of it float wells

1670
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:33,810
combing.
Oh No,

1671
01:13:33,810 --> 01:13:34,291
call me.
Sorry.

1672
01:13:34,291 --> 01:13:36,770
I thought your time at Giuliani flowing
in the wind.

1673
01:13:36,780 --> 01:13:37,920
That was,
that was horrifying.

1674
01:13:38,450 --> 01:13:41,790
It was horrifying.
It didn't even look like it looked like

1675
01:13:41,791 --> 01:13:44,810
a demon with a trump suit on.
Oh God,

1676
01:13:44,811 --> 01:13:47,270
I can't.
That's all I actually can.

1677
01:13:47,350 --> 01:13:50,140
Oh God.
Like there's like a monsters on

1678
01:13:53,060 --> 01:13:56,940
like they dollum up a demon and the
trump suit.

1679
01:13:56,941 --> 01:13:59,190
Did you see Ivanka trump holding those
vials?

1680
01:13:59,191 --> 01:14:04,191
Like she was like trying to cure cancer.
She's like just just doing her biology

1681
01:14:04,921 --> 01:14:08,790
stuff and in the lab she do a lot of
that is testing some samples.

1682
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:11,580
Diseases.
Yeah.

1683
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:14,710
She fucking hates him so much.
She,

1684
01:14:14,740 --> 01:14:16,700
when he tries to hold her hand and she
like get away,

1685
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:18,270
get away.
That's like this.

1686
01:14:18,290 --> 01:14:20,830
A bunch of clips like trying to hold
hands with her.

1687
01:14:20,831 --> 01:14:21,550
She's like,
nope,

1688
01:14:21,550 --> 01:14:24,370
there's a bug from her wearing the wacky
white hat and he's like,

1689
01:14:24,371 --> 01:14:24,941
come on,
hold my hand.

1690
01:14:24,941 --> 01:14:25,580
Hold on.
Nope.

1691
01:14:25,580 --> 01:14:27,810
Nope.
What do it people watch it.

1692
01:14:27,870 --> 01:14:29,380
You get to hold my hand.
People watching.

1693
01:14:32,110 --> 01:14:34,510
It's so strange.
It's like,

1694
01:14:34,820 --> 01:14:37,420
that's like when cooper was like,
did you want to have sex with trump

1695
01:14:37,430 --> 01:14:38,111
here?
She was like,

1696
01:14:38,111 --> 01:14:39,340
no,
of course I didn't.

1697
01:14:39,790 --> 01:14:41,620
Oh Man.
Oh No.

1698
01:14:42,860 --> 01:14:44,860
I touch your hair.
I dyed your hen

1699
01:14:46,970 --> 01:14:48,910
trying to hit your head,
but he got it eventually.

1700
01:14:48,911 --> 01:14:50,090
Got It.
Got It.

1701
01:14:50,110 --> 01:14:51,220
Shit.
You got it.

1702
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:52,840
Did you see him?
Look at him?

1703
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:58,840
God,
these people are really admiring her

1704
01:14:59,020 --> 01:15:02,220
because of her composure through all
this because she's not freaking out and

1705
01:15:02,230 --> 01:15:03,670
going crazy.
Well,

1706
01:15:03,671 --> 01:15:05,790
she's just kind of keeping it together
through all this.

1707
01:15:05,791 --> 01:15:06,730
I mean,
it's gotta be hard.

1708
01:15:07,170 --> 01:15:08,280
Yeah,
it is.

1709
01:15:08,290 --> 01:15:10,420
I mean,
fucking president after this guy,

1710
01:15:10,570 --> 01:15:13,510
like the scrutiny that he's been under
in whether he deserves it or not.

1711
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:17,050
I'm not saying he doesn't,
but who the fuck would want that

1712
01:15:17,051 --> 01:15:18,340
microscope up your ass?
Yeah.

1713
01:15:18,580 --> 01:15:21,160
Who would want that?
I think it's an arrangement just like

1714
01:15:21,161 --> 01:15:23,260
him and stormy Daniels,
that she wanted a job in the

1715
01:15:23,261 --> 01:15:24,094
apprenticeship.

1716
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:27,490
What I'm saying is like,
how will we going to get another

1717
01:15:27,491 --> 01:15:30,220
president like they're going to do you
know what the fuck they're gonna.

1718
01:15:30,250 --> 01:15:33,790
They're gonna look up Kanye his ass with
a microscope and he's going to go crazy

1719
01:15:33,791 --> 01:15:35,830
again.
He's gonna flip freak out and go to some

1720
01:15:36,130 --> 01:15:37,300
insane asylum.
Like,

1721
01:15:37,301 --> 01:15:39,520
he doesn't understand that he's saying,
he tweeted,

1722
01:15:39,521 --> 01:15:41,530
he was like,
does this look like the sunken place?

1723
01:15:41,531 --> 01:15:44,410
And it's just like his giant corridor in
his house and it's like,

1724
01:15:44,590 --> 01:15:47,560
I don't know dude.
I think you're liking from get out.

1725
01:15:47,650 --> 01:15:48,760
Cause that everyone's like,
dude,

1726
01:15:48,761 --> 01:15:50,340
you're in the sunken place.
You don't get out when he,

1727
01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:53,010
when he sinks down to the second place.
But he's like doubling down and he's

1728
01:15:53,020 --> 01:15:53,701
like,
does this look good?

1729
01:15:53,701 --> 01:15:56,770
The sunken place,
and it's like showing a baller house is

1730
01:15:56,771 --> 01:15:58,660
baller house in hidden hills,
which is like,

1731
01:15:58,680 --> 01:15:59,560
uh,
have you seen,

1732
01:15:59,740 --> 01:16:00,600
what does it mean?
Um,

1733
01:16:00,790 --> 01:16:02,080
mayweather?
Is that the guy's name?

1734
01:16:02,650 --> 01:16:03,670
His lawyer.
His,

1735
01:16:03,671 --> 01:16:05,770
uh,
instagram is unbelievable.

1736
01:16:05,771 --> 01:16:07,090
Dude.
He's great

1737
01:16:09,330 --> 01:16:10,720
wearing costumes and shit.
He's like,

1738
01:16:10,721 --> 01:16:11,890
I'm the joker.
And he's like,

1739
01:16:11,891 --> 01:16:12,880
dude,
it's not even Halloween.

1740
01:16:12,881 --> 01:16:14,650
What are you doing please?
I'm having fun.

1741
01:16:18,180 --> 01:16:22,510
Just running around with the time.
His life before traumatic brain injury.

1742
01:16:22,511 --> 01:16:23,140
Now,
just joking.

1743
01:16:23,140 --> 01:16:27,000
He doesn't even have brain injury.
It's fascinating about him because he's

1744
01:16:27,030 --> 01:16:28,810
such a good domestic.
Whoa,

1745
01:16:28,811 --> 01:16:31,170
look at that.
He's such a good defensive.

1746
01:16:32,710 --> 01:16:37,710
This is counting as the breadwinner.
It says he's just sitting there counting

1747
01:16:38,140 --> 01:16:39,580
dude,
there's a hilarious photo of him like

1748
01:16:39,581 --> 01:16:42,700
sitting in the middle of just this huge
empty room and he's just like,

1749
01:16:43,270 --> 01:16:46,770
I don't even know his find the Kanye
Soto Kanye.

1750
01:16:46,820 --> 01:16:48,760
He's a trip.
He really is a trip and he's,

1751
01:16:48,910 --> 01:16:51,040
he's,
whether he means to be or not,

1752
01:16:51,041 --> 01:16:54,010
he's a master at getting people to pay
attention to him,

1753
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:56,170
whether it,
whether this is just because he's so

1754
01:16:56,171 --> 01:17:00,160
wacky that everybody's paying attention
to him or whether it's a real calculated

1755
01:17:00,161 --> 01:17:04,480
sort of maneuvered to act outrageous and
act like he's out of control.

1756
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:05,950
But boys,
he fucking good at it.

1757
01:17:05,950 --> 01:17:07,180
Here it is.
It's like,

1758
01:17:07,181 --> 01:17:08,620
dude,
do you didn't have any furniture.

1759
01:17:08,730 --> 01:17:10,910
It was like bench at the end of this.
A weird ass hoe.

1760
01:17:10,911 --> 01:17:15,911
This look like in place and he's crying
laughing now it looks like this looks

1761
01:17:18,201 --> 01:17:20,750
like a table that kind of looks like
shit man.

1762
01:17:20,751 --> 01:17:23,150
You don't have really have good style
with a buck a whoa.

1763
01:17:23,151 --> 01:17:25,550
He's got a white torso in the
background.

1764
01:17:25,551 --> 01:17:28,370
Scroll up again,
but what does that torso in the

1765
01:17:28,450 --> 01:17:29,430
background?
What's that?

1766
01:17:29,820 --> 01:17:30,920
Kim's like,
actually,

1767
01:17:30,921 --> 01:17:33,380
can we just get it done out of here?
The waist is too thick.

1768
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:34,191
Yeah.
Can,

1769
01:17:34,191 --> 01:17:36,670
can you give this thing Lipo a bigger
ass?

1770
01:17:36,710 --> 01:17:39,520
Give it a bigger ass.
So straight.

1771
01:17:39,530 --> 01:17:42,350
See us the car door.
A lot.

1772
01:17:42,470 --> 01:17:46,640
Like a parking garage or like what is
the long ass open space with white

1773
01:17:46,641 --> 01:17:47,700
walls?
Suck it.

1774
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:49,610
Does this look like a sunken place?

1775
01:17:51,140 --> 01:17:52,520
Wow.
Fantastic.

1776
01:17:52,610 --> 01:17:53,520
Um,
babe,

1777
01:17:53,780 --> 01:17:58,780
we had a rule not to show our home,
so can we now allow K U W K to keeping

1778
01:18:01,101 --> 01:18:03,110
up with the Kardashians filming in the
home?

1779
01:18:03,140 --> 01:18:04,100
This is,
oh,

1780
01:18:04,150 --> 01:18:07,280
well.
So they're communicating only through

1781
01:18:07,281 --> 01:18:09,050
tweets.
She's like,

1782
01:18:09,051 --> 01:18:13,430
come home and take care of the kids.
They've been winning a fucking genius.

1783
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:15,920
Wow.
Poor.

1784
01:18:15,921 --> 01:18:19,430
But I'm not here blowing minds.
Do you like how trump is so desperate

1785
01:18:19,431 --> 01:18:20,450
for attention that he was like,
cool.

1786
01:18:20,451 --> 01:18:21,390
Kanye.
Thank yeah.

1787
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:22,370
He's like,
I love you.

1788
01:18:22,460 --> 01:18:23,530
I love your Cognac.
You,

1789
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:27,050
Kanye.
I was talking about how I wanted Kanye

1790
01:18:27,080 --> 01:18:28,550
or not Kanye.
I wanted,

1791
01:18:28,551 --> 01:18:29,300
uh,
to,

1792
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:32,030
to meet with trump,
to see if I could talk him into actually

1793
01:18:32,031 --> 01:18:35,720
fighting Joe Biden.
It's like you're a businessman.

1794
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:37,190
You want to make that,
I'd be like,

1795
01:18:37,191 --> 01:18:38,360
you're,
you're the best at everything.

1796
01:18:38,361 --> 01:18:39,710
Could be the best at fighting.
Hey,

1797
01:18:39,711 --> 01:18:41,720
we're in a reality star culture.
Why not?

1798
01:18:41,780 --> 01:18:42,381
Why not?
How much?

1799
01:18:42,381 --> 01:18:43,310
I don't,
first of all,

1800
01:18:43,550 --> 01:18:46,790
awesome Joe Biden's on death door.
All he has to do is have a stiff jab and

1801
01:18:46,791 --> 01:18:48,410
Joe Biden's going down,
he's fucked.

1802
01:18:48,750 --> 01:18:49,310
You know,
he could,

1803
01:18:49,310 --> 01:18:51,160
trump really could win.
It's take us just state,

1804
01:18:51,161 --> 01:18:54,580
just ramp up the diet pills,
choke him with the hairpiece.

1805
01:18:55,080 --> 01:18:56,600
Hairpieces fragile.
You can't.

1806
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:58,340
So Dude,
last time I was on,

1807
01:18:58,341 --> 01:19:00,250
I was just about to go to Venezuela and

1808
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:03,430
that was insane.
I went and embedded myself in the

1809
01:19:03,431 --> 01:19:04,990
protests there.
Holy Shit.

1810
01:19:04,991 --> 01:19:09,010
Is the media line about that too?
And then the line about their,

1811
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:11,080
you know,
vices on the ground acting like bad

1812
01:19:11,081 --> 01:19:12,520
asses.
They're embedding themselves in the

1813
01:19:12,521 --> 01:19:14,860
protest and being like,
look at these fucking awesome dudes.

1814
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:17,470
Um,
it was basically fascist mobs,

1815
01:19:17,471 --> 01:19:20,680
tried to lynn just and we got chased out
of the country and then our colleague

1816
01:19:20,681 --> 01:19:24,160
got shot because we dare to tell that,
um,

1817
01:19:24,580 --> 01:19:26,710
the death toll that we kept hearing in
the mainstream media,

1818
01:19:26,711 --> 01:19:28,600
that Maduro is mowing down all these
protesters,

1819
01:19:28,601 --> 01:19:31,300
we found out that the majority of the
dust are actually caused by the

1820
01:19:31,301 --> 01:19:33,790
protesters,
like either shooting people,

1821
01:19:33,791 --> 01:19:36,370
lynching people alive,
burning them alive,

1822
01:19:36,371 --> 01:19:41,080
or doing these giant roadblock cade's
where they would light giant flaming

1823
01:19:41,081 --> 01:19:43,400
piles of trash and people would be,
you know,

1824
01:19:43,450 --> 01:19:46,240
flying off the freeway or getting an
accidents and shit.

1825
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:48,400
And so once we just reported those
facts,

1826
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:51,460
then this lynch mob came after us.
It was very,

1827
01:19:51,461 --> 01:19:52,990
very scary.
And look,

1828
01:19:52,991 --> 01:19:55,930
I mean the media is lying about the
popular support that that Maduro's

1829
01:19:55,931 --> 01:19:57,730
government has.
Um,

1830
01:19:57,790 --> 01:20:02,320
there was massive program and rallies
there and the country's pretty divided

1831
01:20:02,321 --> 01:20:04,120
where it just depends on who you would
talk to.

1832
01:20:04,540 --> 01:20:06,280
So what does,
what does vice doing over there?

1833
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:08,640
I mean,
is an imperial arm.

1834
01:20:08,641 --> 01:20:09,900
You should,
everyone should check out my brother's

1835
01:20:09,901 --> 01:20:12,360
documentary called the brazen imperial.
Oh Dude.

1836
01:20:12,450 --> 01:20:16,300
100% of the u s government,
Shane Smiths and imperial arms.

1837
01:20:16,301 --> 01:20:19,020
Smith,
welcome to Obama and Biden into their

1838
01:20:19,021 --> 01:20:19,890
office.
And they were like,

1839
01:20:19,950 --> 01:20:23,250
bff dude,
the coo of vice was like Obama's like

1840
01:20:23,251 --> 01:20:25,320
spokesperson.
I mean good friends with Shane.

1841
01:20:25,350 --> 01:20:26,550
I know him,
I know him very well.

1842
01:20:26,551 --> 01:20:27,900
I mean,
vice repeats.

1843
01:20:28,140 --> 01:20:32,460
He's not an imperial guy.
I'm saying they're lying.

1844
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:33,780
They're lying.
They're lying.

1845
01:20:33,810 --> 01:20:37,230
The line not lying the line because they
look,

1846
01:20:37,231 --> 01:20:39,060
I think Obama and Biden are war
criminals.

1847
01:20:39,061 --> 01:20:42,420
So I don't think it's cool as a
journalist to not challenge power.

1848
01:20:42,421 --> 01:20:45,960
And so when you invite these people into
your office and are really buddy buddy

1849
01:20:45,961 --> 01:20:47,280
with them,
I'm offended by that.

1850
01:20:47,550 --> 01:20:48,990
You're such a radical lefty.
I love it.

1851
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:51,750
It's trailing Obama and Biden,
a war criminals.

1852
01:20:52,090 --> 01:20:54,970
Even though the lefties,
even the lefties,

1853
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:58,380
they drone King Babe.
Drone King.

1854
01:20:58,500 --> 01:20:59,850
Yeah.
There was definitely a lot of drone

1855
01:20:59,851 --> 01:21:00,640
desks,
but um,

1856
01:21:00,640 --> 01:21:03,720
check out a very heavy agenda.
And my brother's documentary just goes

1857
01:21:03,721 --> 01:21:06,750
over kind of a lot of stuff about vice.
But I think the problem that I have with

1858
01:21:06,751 --> 01:21:08,820
advice is,
is just like the problem that I have

1859
01:21:08,821 --> 01:21:10,590
with all,
all other corporate media,

1860
01:21:10,591 --> 01:21:13,410
like we were saying,
there's always a that's uniform that

1861
01:21:13,411 --> 01:21:16,380
basically promotes the u s empire and
promotes American exceptionalism.

1862
01:21:16,381 --> 01:21:18,120
So clearly you've never,
when you fuck,

1863
01:21:18,121 --> 01:21:19,740
that's delicious.
You know,

1864
01:21:19,741 --> 01:21:21,630
what is that best show on Vice

1865
01:21:22,850 --> 01:21:25,010
Eddie Wong's world?
Those two?

1866
01:21:25,250 --> 01:21:27,170
What's that?
Action Bronson is.

1867
01:21:27,171 --> 01:21:28,220
Fuck,
that's delicious.

1868
01:21:28,250 --> 01:21:30,140
That's his show.
You know,

1869
01:21:30,141 --> 01:21:32,040
Action Bronson has the rapper.
Oh Yay.

1870
01:21:32,050 --> 01:21:33,560
Yeah.
I haven't watched it.

1871
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:36,200
Never had a human being come in the
studio and smoke more weed.

1872
01:21:36,710 --> 01:21:40,350
Never seen anybody smoke.
He'd just non stop.

1873
01:21:40,370 --> 01:21:42,830
We had an ashtray that we took photos of
it afterwards.

1874
01:21:42,890 --> 01:21:46,490
Like this is how much weed action
Bronson smoked while he was on the show.

1875
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:48,110
I just ran into him the other day at the
UFC.

1876
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:51,080
He smoked like how many joints?
10 joints.

1877
01:21:51,770 --> 01:21:53,210
Easily.
Big Ass joints.

1878
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:57,310
Big Fat boys puffed him down to the NUB.
And we were,

1879
01:21:57,340 --> 01:21:59,120
we were with Jamie and I were stunned
where like,

1880
01:21:59,121 --> 01:22:01,630
how's he keep going?
That's on fights too.

1881
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:03,440
Nice.
Does have a lot of good,

1882
01:22:03,460 --> 01:22:06,550
she got a lot of good Shim.
Is that when it comes to coverage,

1883
01:22:06,551 --> 01:22:08,530
a foreign policy,
I think they really missed the boat.

1884
01:22:08,890 --> 01:22:11,500
Well it's been good on like that's the
thing,

1885
01:22:11,501 --> 01:22:12,700
it's the,
it's still accept.

1886
01:22:12,730 --> 01:22:13,481
Um,
you know,

1887
01:22:13,481 --> 01:22:16,030
it's like anyone can kind of submit.
It's a kind of like Huffington Post.

1888
01:22:16,031 --> 01:22:16,770
It's like a huge

1889
01:22:16,770 --> 01:22:19,590
10.
I think they have a hard time filtering

1890
01:22:19,591 --> 01:22:21,150
everything out.
I think they've gotten,

1891
01:22:21,450 --> 01:22:24,300
you know,
they were this radical sort of like

1892
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:28,050
upstart where people hadn't heard of
them before and they were doing wild

1893
01:22:28,051 --> 01:22:30,180
shit and they had some really cool
videos like,

1894
01:22:30,660 --> 01:22:34,470
like the guide to travel and they did
that thing where they went to Liberia

1895
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:37,920
and met with general button naked and
he's explaining about eating children

1896
01:22:37,921 --> 01:22:39,660
and cutting their heart's fucking
insane.

1897
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:42,090
So that was all shane.
Shane did a lot of that stuff.

1898
01:22:42,210 --> 01:22:43,680
That,
and that was the early days.

1899
01:22:44,030 --> 01:22:45,150
But that,
that's I,

1900
01:22:45,350 --> 01:22:48,100
I appreciate that,
that kind of style of journalism.

1901
01:22:48,101 --> 01:22:50,230
But I feel like what's missing is the
context behind it.

1902
01:22:50,231 --> 01:22:52,480
Like just vice will go to India and be
like,

1903
01:22:52,481 --> 01:22:53,710
fuck,
this is fucking nuts.

1904
01:22:53,711 --> 01:22:55,450
And you're like,
well why is there this massive

1905
01:22:55,451 --> 01:22:56,980
disparity?
And you know,

1906
01:22:56,990 --> 01:22:59,320
it qualities.
So it's a different style of journalism.

1907
01:22:59,321 --> 01:23:01,990
But I do think that they really missed
the boat on Venezuela,

1908
01:23:01,991 --> 01:23:05,980
Russia and Ukraine and some other things
when it comes to global conflicts

1909
01:23:05,981 --> 01:23:09,370
because that's just the problem with a
lot of journalism and corporate media in

1910
01:23:09,371 --> 01:23:12,430
general is that you're towing a line
because you're an American.

1911
01:23:12,431 --> 01:23:13,690
Just like we were talking about
Israelis.

1912
01:23:13,691 --> 01:23:16,930
I mean you have preconceived notions,
you have your own bias,

1913
01:23:16,931 --> 01:23:19,690
you have your own ethnocentric lens
about world issues.

1914
01:23:19,691 --> 01:23:21,610
So it bleeds over into those conflicts.

1915
01:23:21,610 --> 01:23:23,290
And unless you're like an
internationalist,

1916
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:25,630
can you see the world from a different
Lens?

1917
01:23:25,631 --> 01:23:27,040
But when I was on the ground and
Venezuela,

1918
01:23:27,041 --> 01:23:29,170
I was like,
this is not what we're seeing.

1919
01:23:29,370 --> 01:23:31,240
So what do you think is happening in
Venezuela?

1920
01:23:31,241 --> 01:23:34,120
So what we,
I mean there,

1921
01:23:34,130 --> 01:23:37,120
there's a lot of things happening,
but the thing that the u s government

1922
01:23:37,121 --> 01:23:39,790
wants to obfuscate,
and that's why you see Venezuela

1923
01:23:39,791 --> 01:23:44,020
continues to come up all the time as
another country that needs to be taken

1924
01:23:44,021 --> 01:23:46,450
out and helped by US interests,
right?

1925
01:23:46,451 --> 01:23:49,400
Because they haven't bowed down to us.
Economic Agenda,

1926
01:23:49,401 --> 01:23:50,380
Gemini,
it's very simple.

1927
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:55,510
The XERO has popular support.
Maduro has a mass movement behind him.

1928
01:23:55,511 --> 01:23:57,730
The Child Easton movement is alive and
well,

1929
01:23:58,180 --> 01:24:00,580
and that's undeniable.
It doesn't matter if you hate him or

1930
01:24:00,581 --> 01:24:02,320
love him,
but what does the narrative like?

1931
01:24:02,321 --> 01:24:04,450
What are we being told?
That the narrative is that he's a

1932
01:24:04,451 --> 01:24:08,820
totalitarian dictator who has seized all
of power and that he has,

1933
01:24:08,850 --> 01:24:12,070
there's zero democracy and that everyone
wants him gone.

1934
01:24:12,071 --> 01:24:15,190
And that the protestors,
he keeps mowing down and executing them

1935
01:24:15,191 --> 01:24:16,670
whenever they come to the streets.
Not True.

1936
01:24:16,780 --> 01:24:17,860
100% bullshit.

1937
01:24:19,900 --> 01:24:22,330
I think it's [inaudible] and that's,
you see the same thing.

1938
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:24,010
All these countries.
You see the same thing,

1939
01:24:24,011 --> 01:24:25,930
whether it be Cuba,
Venezuela,

1940
01:24:25,931 --> 01:24:27,620
Syria.
I have a lot of questions about the

1941
01:24:27,621 --> 01:24:29,690
Syria shit that we're seeing.
Um,

1942
01:24:29,860 --> 01:24:31,060
a lot of people that have questions
about the,

1943
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:35,470
they don't believe the gas attacks.
There's a lot of people that don't think

1944
01:24:35,471 --> 01:24:37,930
that actually happens.
It makes no tactical sense for Assad to

1945
01:24:37,931 --> 01:24:40,540
do that.
When he was winning the war and was

1946
01:24:40,541 --> 01:24:44,380
taking back the remaining territory to
do that also didn't we let them know

1947
01:24:44,381 --> 01:24:46,770
that we're going to bomb them?
And like the,

1948
01:24:47,140 --> 01:24:50,650
I don't think anybody got killed.
We don't know.

1949
01:24:50,651 --> 01:24:52,990
I mean that's the thing is there's
multiple journalists who have gone to

1950
01:24:52,991 --> 01:24:57,160
the site of the hospital and they,
and there's very contradictory

1951
01:24:57,161 --> 01:24:58,900
narratives.
So we don't know until the chemical

1952
01:24:58,901 --> 01:25:01,060
weapons inspectors go and do their
investigation.

1953
01:25:01,060 --> 01:25:03,010
But why,
what I find odd is just the,

1954
01:25:03,011 --> 01:25:04,780
again,
uniformity with putting out these

1955
01:25:04,781 --> 01:25:06,470
fucking narratives by the same people
who are,

1956
01:25:06,471 --> 01:25:09,310
who sold to see rock.
Do you remember when Obama wanted to

1957
01:25:09,311 --> 01:25:10,450
bomb Syria?
And everybody's like,

1958
01:25:10,451 --> 01:25:12,820
fuck you.
And then it just went away.

1959
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:14,280
I remember he,
yeah,

1960
01:25:14,370 --> 01:25:15,820
he,
he staved off.

1961
01:25:15,821 --> 01:25:18,310
He staved off a lot.
And unfortunately we've,

1962
01:25:18,340 --> 01:25:19,990
you know,
the white helmets over there,

1963
01:25:20,070 --> 01:25:22,660
um,
are kind of an arm of the US government

1964
01:25:22,661 --> 01:25:25,450
to,
we've been funding them with $200

1965
01:25:25,450 --> 01:25:28,900
million and on USA id,
I mean all of these groups on the

1966
01:25:28,901 --> 01:25:30,610
ground,
it's like whether you're Obama and you

1967
01:25:30,611 --> 01:25:35,611
use more covert means through USA ID and
more like drone warfare or you're the

1968
01:25:36,071 --> 01:25:37,780
trump John Bolton type where you're
like,

1969
01:25:37,781 --> 01:25:41,260
let's fucking preemptively bond on him
and kill their families and torture

1970
01:25:41,270 --> 01:25:42,103
their families.
I mean,

1971
01:25:42,640 --> 01:25:44,170
it's two sides of the same coin.

1972
01:25:44,670 --> 01:25:47,980
It's the empire that that's consistent
and will maintain.

1973
01:25:48,010 --> 01:25:50,350
But it's scary because Syria,
um,

1974
01:25:50,410 --> 01:25:53,560
it shows you how easy were duped,
you know,

1975
01:25:53,561 --> 01:25:54,580
I mean,
during the Iraq war,

1976
01:25:54,581 --> 01:25:56,080
it's like,
at least you had Colin Powell holding up

1977
01:25:56,081 --> 01:25:57,150
the vial being like,
here's the thing.

1978
01:25:57,160 --> 01:26:00,280
And Dan thrax now it's just like,
you just have a social media video and

1979
01:26:00,281 --> 01:26:02,620
we just fucking have Israel,
our garrison in the Middle East,

1980
01:26:02,621 --> 01:26:05,870
bomb Syria to test the waters and then
we just bombed them.

1981
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:10,460
And then you have asshole like neo
liberal think tankers all paraded around

1982
01:26:10,461 --> 01:26:11,900
the media,
all these generals.

1983
01:26:11,901 --> 01:26:13,880
Right.
All these experts who are all literally

1984
01:26:13,881 --> 01:26:17,570
Iraq war propaganda is,
or generals or defense contractor ceos,

1985
01:26:18,050 --> 01:26:20,060
and they're all just like,
trump isn't doing enough.

1986
01:26:20,061 --> 01:26:23,000
He needs the bomb more.
This isn't sending enough of a message

1987
01:26:23,001 --> 01:26:23,990
to Assad.
It's like,

1988
01:26:24,650 --> 01:26:26,300
what have we ever,
one is bombing.

1989
01:26:26,300 --> 01:26:28,780
Anyone ever done anything good?
What?

1990
01:26:29,150 --> 01:26:31,130
Tell me when the fucking us is
intervene.

1991
01:26:31,131 --> 01:26:34,190
That's actually turned out good.
So don't sell this bullshit.

1992
01:26:34,191 --> 01:26:36,770
Humanitarianism.
It just nuts that we just keep falling

1993
01:26:36,771 --> 01:26:37,910
for it.
And people were like,

1994
01:26:37,911 --> 01:26:39,320
well,
what are we supposed to do?

1995
01:26:39,650 --> 01:26:42,140
Fucking don't do anything.
Don't,

1996
01:26:42,410 --> 01:26:44,870
don't do anything.
And I know that people are like,

1997
01:26:44,871 --> 01:26:45,561
oh,
you know,

1998
01:26:45,561 --> 01:26:49,490
isolation is ms bad.
Look the u s empires horrific and the

1999
01:26:49,491 --> 01:26:52,940
largest threat to humanity,
the world's biggest polluter.

2000
01:26:53,420 --> 01:26:56,330
I'm exempt from climate treaty's all the
shit you never see on the mainstream

2001
01:26:56,331 --> 01:26:56,871
media.
Why?

2002
01:26:56,871 --> 01:26:59,330
Because it's owned by oil,
oil corporations and defense

2003
01:26:59,331 --> 01:27:01,460
contractors.
That's why you see ads for Boeing and

2004
01:27:01,461 --> 01:27:02,294
Raytheon.
Like we're,

2005
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:06,050
we're not looking to buy a tank.
When we watch the news that's just

2006
01:27:06,051 --> 01:27:08,450
there,
or overlords controlling the narrative,

2007
01:27:08,451 --> 01:27:11,270
they know the limitations of the debate.
They know that parameters and the

2008
01:27:11,271 --> 01:27:13,700
framing that they're allowed to work
within.

2009
01:27:14,300 --> 01:27:17,330
They can't even talk about the u s as an
empire of the world's biggest empire.

2010
01:27:17,331 --> 01:27:18,164
The world's ever seen.

2011
01:27:18,580 --> 01:27:21,400
Fascinating.
The difference between what you hear

2012
01:27:21,401 --> 01:27:25,990
from Internet commentators who are free
of networks and pr producers and

2013
01:27:25,991 --> 01:27:28,900
executives are telling them what to do
and sponsors and,

2014
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:31,000
and the,
the version that you're getting on

2015
01:27:31,001 --> 01:27:33,130
television,
the version that you're getting on

2016
01:27:33,131 --> 01:27:35,830
television,
on CNN or on any of these,

2017
01:27:35,860 --> 01:27:38,380
any of these major mainstream news
networks,

2018
01:27:38,620 --> 01:27:43,240
you're getting a very watered down,
very homogenized and pasteurized

2019
01:27:43,241 --> 01:27:43,770
narrative.

2020
01:27:43,770 --> 01:27:45,270
Absolutely.
Absolutely.

2021
01:27:45,271 --> 01:27:46,740
Because I think that's why I do the
show,

2022
01:27:46,741 --> 01:27:49,470
the empire files and,
and media roots radio with my brother

2023
01:27:49,471 --> 01:27:51,480
Robbie Martin at fluorescent gray on
twitter.

2024
01:27:51,481 --> 01:27:54,210
But I do the show with my partner Mike
prisoner.

2025
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:57,000
Um,
because we want to retell these

2026
01:27:57,001 --> 01:27:59,490
narratives that have been lost.
History's always been written by the

2027
01:27:59,491 --> 01:28:01,470
victors.
All of the shit that we're seeing around

2028
01:28:01,471 --> 01:28:05,370
the world needs to be analyzed within
the lens of the u s being the largest

2029
01:28:05,371 --> 01:28:08,820
empire that's siphons all the fucking
money in the world for military

2030
01:28:08,821 --> 01:28:10,320
expenses.
I mean every issue,

2031
01:28:10,321 --> 01:28:12,780
domestic and internationally,
it's all shaped.

2032
01:28:13,350 --> 01:28:17,030
You're out there doing this,
you're traveling the Palestine,

2033
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:18,690
you're traveling to Venezuela,
you doing all this stuff,

2034
01:28:18,691 --> 01:28:19,800
you're,
you're writing all these things,

2035
01:28:19,801 --> 01:28:23,550
you're doing all these videos.
Does this ever get too much for you?

2036
01:28:23,551 --> 01:28:28,530
Is this ever like overrun your brain?
Has this ever freak you out that none of

2037
01:28:28,531 --> 01:28:29,940
this is getting any better?
And in fact,

2038
01:28:29,941 --> 01:28:30,870
some of it's getting worse.

2039
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:32,810
I mean,
it is depressing to,

2040
01:28:32,990 --> 01:28:34,420
like I was saying,
I mean just the,

2041
01:28:34,550 --> 01:28:37,510
the discourse now where I'm called a
Russian student,

2042
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:38,151
I was like,
look,

2043
01:28:38,151 --> 01:28:40,670
I guess once a Putin puppet,
always a Putin puppet,

2044
01:28:40,671 --> 01:28:42,620
doesn't matter if I left our t three
years ago,

2045
01:28:42,621 --> 01:28:43,131
I,
you know,

2046
01:28:43,131 --> 01:28:47,450
I told you what they were trying this
fucking ship you off to Crimea because

2047
01:28:47,451 --> 01:28:48,740
yeah,
you're boots on the ground,

2048
01:28:48,760 --> 01:28:50,900
young lady.
Go check out the war zone.

2049
01:28:50,930 --> 01:28:54,260
And then the intelligence report that
came out as the definitive proof of

2050
01:28:54,261 --> 01:28:57,650
Russian hacking basically said,
my show that had ended two years prior

2051
01:28:57,651 --> 01:29:01,800
was part of the reason why trump won.
So you have all this desperation to try

2052
01:29:01,801 --> 01:29:05,280
to dilute the narrative and call
everyone a Russian troll and,

2053
01:29:05,281 --> 01:29:06,660
but yeah,
it's depressing as hell Joe,

2054
01:29:06,661 --> 01:29:10,170
because I feel like the sanity is
fucking lost and I can't actually have

2055
01:29:10,171 --> 01:29:12,810
conversations with people and talk about
reality because either you're a trump

2056
01:29:12,811 --> 01:29:16,890
boot licker who thinks everything's fake
news and you think q and on is gonna

2057
01:29:16,891 --> 01:29:20,580
fucking expose the pedophiles across the
country or you think I'm a Russian troll

2058
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:24,030
because I'm saying something that goes
against the grain.

2059
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:27,780
It's really disturbing.
We're living in a really,

2060
01:29:27,781 --> 01:29:28,620
really disturbing time.

2061
01:29:29,060 --> 01:29:32,240
Too much information too.
I think that's part of the problem.

2062
01:29:32,390 --> 01:29:36,040
I think part of the problem is a
narrative gets so diluted toxify it and

2063
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:40,370
to think about,
because you know there are pedophiles

2064
01:29:40,371 --> 01:29:42,950
out there.
I mean whenever someone does get exposed

2065
01:29:42,951 --> 01:29:44,840
and some pedophile ring gets broken up,
you go,

2066
01:29:44,870 --> 01:29:45,703
oh,
that's real.

2067
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:47,900
Why don't even think it was real?
Because these people are so fucking

2068
01:29:47,901 --> 01:29:50,840
stupid and some of the shit that they
believe is so dumb.

2069
01:29:51,350 --> 01:29:53,810
You know there are a lot of them are the
same people that are chem trail.

2070
01:29:53,811 --> 01:29:56,900
People are flat earth people.
There's like so much of the same shit

2071
01:29:56,901 --> 01:30:00,830
coming out of these people that when you
find out that there is a group of people

2072
01:30:00,831 --> 01:30:03,650
that are pedophiles,
that there really have been involved in

2073
01:30:03,651 --> 01:30:06,530
human trafficking or child slavery,
which is a real thing.

2074
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:08,330
I mean this is something that's almost
like,

2075
01:30:09,050 --> 01:30:12,650
it's almost like been talked about by so
many wacky people that people don't

2076
01:30:12,651 --> 01:30:16,250
believe it until you read like the,
the story about Jimmy Savile,

2077
01:30:16,251 --> 01:30:16,700
how do is that?

2078
01:30:16,700 --> 01:30:18,200
I say his name,
the guy in England.

2079
01:30:18,201 --> 01:30:18,890
You're like,
wait a minute,

2080
01:30:18,890 --> 01:30:20,750
what?
How long did this go on for?

2081
01:30:21,050 --> 01:30:22,990
Or San Dusky or any of these other,
you are,

2082
01:30:23,090 --> 01:30:24,410
oh my God,
this is real.

2083
01:30:24,411 --> 01:30:25,450
This team.
Yes.

2084
01:30:25,470 --> 01:30:28,400
That guy.
How many gymnast were molested?

2085
01:30:28,401 --> 01:30:31,410
Like a hundred more.
I think it was more than a hundred

2086
01:30:31,550 --> 01:30:32,960
right?
This is modern times.

2087
01:30:32,990 --> 01:30:35,270
This is real.
Like it's almost like when you hear

2088
01:30:35,271 --> 01:30:36,230
about someone like that,
you're like,

2089
01:30:36,231 --> 01:30:37,970
that's not even possible.
How could that happen?

2090
01:30:38,240 --> 01:30:39,140
And then you go,
wait a minute.

2091
01:30:39,141 --> 01:30:39,710
He,
oh,

2092
01:30:39,710 --> 01:30:40,610
now he's in jail.
No,

2093
01:30:40,611 --> 01:30:42,710
it's true.
And all these poor gymnast are coming

2094
01:30:42,711 --> 01:30:44,210
out and saying,
this guy was molesting me and I will say

2095
01:30:44,211 --> 01:30:48,480
nine and 11 and it's fucked.
But you,

2096
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:52,880
that stuff gets lost in the shuffle
because there's so much noise.

2097
01:30:53,090 --> 01:30:55,860
There's so much information and there's
too many things to pay attention.

2098
01:30:55,861 --> 01:30:58,220
You can tell him be about Venezuela.
You're telling me about Palestine.

2099
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:00,770
Just those two things are bouncing back
and forth in my head.

2100
01:31:01,010 --> 01:31:04,570
And then what about stormy Daniels?
And then there's another guy or the Gal

2101
01:31:04,580 --> 01:31:08,080
he paid off all my Michael Collins
pleading the fifth shit and it's got to

2102
01:31:08,090 --> 01:31:08,570
happen,
right?

2103
01:31:08,570 --> 01:31:11,120
Jokes like as like just happened
quickly.

2104
01:31:11,300 --> 01:31:14,000
I mean what was also in,
in Columbia on the front lines of the

2105
01:31:14,001 --> 01:31:17,100
drug war that people should check out in
the empire files to and that that shit's

2106
01:31:17,101 --> 01:31:17,810
nuts too.

2107
01:31:17,810 --> 01:31:18,950
Do you know what I saw?
That was great.

2108
01:31:19,010 --> 01:31:23,720
But that fucking Tom Cruise movie that
my time American made made in America,

2109
01:31:23,721 --> 01:31:26,990
whatever it is,
American made the movie about Barry

2110
01:31:26,990 --> 01:31:28,340
Seal's,
who's a CIA drug runner.

2111
01:31:28,460 --> 01:31:29,720
Wait,
is this older?

2112
01:31:29,780 --> 01:31:31,460
No,
just happened a year ago.

2113
01:31:32,010 --> 01:31:33,250
No,
I did not hear about that.

2114
01:31:33,251 --> 01:31:37,430
Very seals is the guy who was dropping
off the drugs that they would get from

2115
01:31:37,431 --> 01:31:39,740
the Colombian cartel and you would drop
him off in Mena,

2116
01:31:39,741 --> 01:31:41,480
Arkansas.
Do you know the story?

2117
01:31:42,100 --> 01:31:45,290
Fascinating story.
It was exposed because two kids were

2118
01:31:45,291 --> 01:31:49,220
there when the drugs got dropped off and
they were murdered and their bodies were

2119
01:31:49,221 --> 01:31:53,540
put on train tracks.
The trains ran over their bodies.

2120
01:31:53,570 --> 01:31:57,470
The cop said these kids were high and
they fell asleep on the train tracks.

2121
01:31:57,620 --> 01:32:00,100
Their parents did an independent found
out

2122
01:32:00,190 --> 01:32:04,180
that there's stab wounds in the kids,
so then the parents brought this

2123
01:32:04,181 --> 01:32:06,580
information to light.
Everything unfolds.

2124
01:32:06,730 --> 01:32:10,840
They find out that this is gigantic drug
ring that was supported by Bill Clinton

2125
01:32:10,850 --> 01:32:14,380
is a big part of the movie was that this
barry seal guys gets arrested with

2126
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:18,250
millions of dollars in cash and coke and
Bill Clinton Calls Up.

2127
01:32:18,251 --> 01:32:20,920
The prosecutor makes them walk.
That's real.

2128
01:32:20,950 --> 01:32:25,030
That really did happen.
This was all in Mena Arkansas when Bill

2129
01:32:25,030 --> 01:32:28,810
Clinton was the governor of Arkansas.
Then goes on to be the president.

2130
01:32:28,930 --> 01:32:33,930
But this guy was bringing in drugs from
Columbia and from South America at the

2131
01:32:34,061 --> 01:32:36,700
behest of the CIA.
And it's a big part of the film now.

2132
01:32:36,701 --> 01:32:39,400
How much of the film is bullshit and how
much of it is real?

2133
01:32:39,430 --> 01:32:42,490
We don't know so much draw order of
Colombia.

2134
01:32:42,700 --> 01:32:45,160
I fucking walked across there is like
not,

2135
01:32:45,220 --> 01:32:48,040
I mean it is ridiculous how open that
shop porous.

2136
01:32:48,520 --> 01:32:50,890
Very porous.
The borders I'm sure.

2137
01:32:50,891 --> 01:32:53,050
But now Columbia is a different animal.
I mean,

2138
01:32:53,230 --> 01:32:54,910
I'm sure there's still growing coke
there,

2139
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,490
but it's not what it used to be mean.
They,

2140
01:32:57,550 --> 01:32:59,680
you know,
both ties to be like very,

2141
01:32:59,681 --> 01:33:01,590
very dangerous and now it's not at all.
Yeah.

2142
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:05,380
The civil war recently ended and Farc is
now d.

2143
01:33:07,150 --> 01:33:09,510
No.
Should I really?

2144
01:33:09,630 --> 01:33:13,120
It's fucking amazing.
The guy who plays Escobar is a fucking

2145
01:33:13,121 --> 01:33:14,310
saint.
Emily,

2146
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:15,153
wait,
what's her name?

2147
01:33:16,030 --> 01:33:17,470
The woman in it.
She's awesome.

2148
01:33:17,640 --> 01:33:19,660
Anyway.
Awesome.

2149
01:33:20,440 --> 01:33:23,680
It's fucking great.
I mean it is really good.

2150
01:33:23,710 --> 01:33:26,150
Nice.
It's one of those shows where you like

2151
01:33:26,151 --> 01:33:28,060
at the end of it you're like,
ah.

2152
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:32,090
In season two my wife shut it off.
So I can't do this anymore.

2153
01:33:32,110 --> 01:33:34,990
Too many people are dying.
What really happened?

2154
01:33:35,140 --> 01:33:37,780
Lots of Waco to it's I'm scared,
dude.

2155
01:33:37,781 --> 01:33:40,300
It's amazing because everyone remembers
Waco vaguely,

2156
01:33:40,780 --> 01:33:43,660
but wow,
you really need to watch it because it

2157
01:33:43,661 --> 01:33:48,070
retells the story from um,
one of the victims eyes and damn,

2158
01:33:48,180 --> 01:33:50,080
they killed people.

2159
01:33:50,080 --> 01:33:53,080
They NASA,
when you see those tanks blowing fire

2160
01:33:53,081 --> 01:33:55,480
into the building and they were trying
to say that it didn't happen that

2161
01:33:55,540 --> 01:33:58,720
fucking video of it,
you can watch the video of the tank

2162
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:01,900
lighting these buildings on fire where
people are inside of them.

2163
01:34:02,370 --> 01:34:05,950
They were driving over the houses while
the people are inside of him.

2164
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:09,310
That's when the militia movement posed a
threat to the government and now they've

2165
01:34:09,311 --> 01:34:11,320
just become,
isn't it weird the evolution how now

2166
01:34:11,321 --> 01:34:14,500
militia people are like pro trump?
It's sort of weird,

2167
01:34:14,530 --> 01:34:18,930
but not the guys up in Oregon that we're
trying to mooch off public land to run

2168
01:34:18,940 --> 01:34:20,020
their cattle.
Who knows?

2169
01:34:20,021 --> 01:34:22,690
They might be pro trump.
Trump just sold off the last national

2170
01:34:22,691 --> 01:34:26,320
parks grand staircase,
open it up for oil and gas drilling.

2171
01:34:26,530 --> 01:34:27,820
They probably like that Shit,
man.

2172
01:34:28,030 --> 01:34:29,890
Yeah,
that's an interesting thing.

2173
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:34,920
Like I've heard very different versions
of that from z Zinky when that guy,

2174
01:34:35,020 --> 01:34:36,490
what does he,
secretary of the interior,

2175
01:34:36,491 --> 01:34:39,010
what does Zinky yeah,
when he was talking about it and he's

2176
01:34:39,011 --> 01:34:42,550
explaining to us not what happened.
And that essentially went right back to

2177
01:34:42,551 --> 01:34:47,350
where the way it was before Obama
changed the legislation changed the

2178
01:34:47,351 --> 01:34:48,820
rules.
I don't understand.

2179
01:34:49,180 --> 01:34:51,440
It was protected under Obama for a good
reason.

2180
01:34:51,470 --> 01:34:54,730
There's dinosaur fossils,
they're native Americans have monuments

2181
01:34:54,731 --> 01:34:55,990
there.
But of course we don't care about native

2182
01:34:55,991 --> 01:34:58,100
American monuments.
We just care about confederate

2183
01:34:58,100 --> 01:35:00,530
monuments.
We don't care about abolishing all the

2184
01:35:00,531 --> 01:35:02,450
native American land and all the
treaties.

2185
01:35:02,451 --> 01:35:06,500
We just care about protecting bizarre
confederate statues around the country.

2186
01:35:06,740 --> 01:35:10,670
I don't think we should protect
confederate statues and s in the sense

2187
01:35:10,671 --> 01:35:12,740
that I don't think they should be in
like,

2188
01:35:12,760 --> 01:35:14,630
you know,
the middle of fucking times,

2189
01:35:15,110 --> 01:35:18,560
squares and shit like that,
but they should do something with them

2190
01:35:18,561 --> 01:35:20,910
the same way they should do something
with Gingiss con statutes.

2191
01:35:22,110 --> 01:35:25,190
Do you know that most of those things
were made during the,

2192
01:35:25,191 --> 01:35:27,260
um,
the Jim Crow era?

2193
01:35:27,400 --> 01:35:29,140
That that's a really good point
constructed.

2194
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:31,640
That's an amazing point.
A lot of people think that it was right

2195
01:35:31,641 --> 01:35:36,050
after the civil war and in fact it was
like in the 60s it was during the civil

2196
01:35:36,051 --> 01:35:38,480
rights movement.
There was a protest to the civil rights

2197
01:35:38,481 --> 01:35:39,231
move with,
oh Yay,

2198
01:35:39,231 --> 01:35:40,250
we'll little don't do it here.

2199
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:46,370
Well here,
here's a statue.

2200
01:35:46,490 --> 01:35:48,050
And they're shitty statues to a lot of
them,

2201
01:35:48,051 --> 01:35:50,330
like really poorly constructed there.
Made him quickly.

2202
01:35:50,700 --> 01:35:53,030
Yeah,
it was a protest to the civil rights

2203
01:35:53,031 --> 01:35:53,960
movement.
A lot of them.

2204
01:35:54,260 --> 01:35:57,200
That's crazy.
But the thing is like they are a

2205
01:35:57,201 --> 01:36:01,010
representation of history.
Just like a gang is con statute would be

2206
01:36:01,011 --> 01:36:03,740
a representation that monster,
I mean we think of gangs.

2207
01:36:03,741 --> 01:36:06,380
Khan is a guy who opened up trade with
China today.

2208
01:36:06,590 --> 01:36:09,050
You know,
you vaguely understand that he was

2209
01:36:09,890 --> 01:36:13,580
responsible for the death of 10% of the
population of the world back then.

2210
01:36:13,850 --> 01:36:17,810
Change The fucking New York Times had an
article about how he changed the carbon

2211
01:36:17,811 --> 01:36:19,880
footprint of the earth.
They,

2212
01:36:19,881 --> 01:36:24,560
there's literally a difference in the
carbon footprint because 10% less people

2213
01:36:24,561 --> 01:36:28,820
were alive during gingiss Khan's reign.
They killed everybody.

2214
01:36:28,850 --> 01:36:30,770
They fucking quit killing millions of
people.

2215
01:36:30,920 --> 01:36:34,190
There's a great Dan Carlin series on it
called the wrath of the cons,

2216
01:36:34,191 --> 01:36:35,630
but I've talked about it way too much.

2217
01:36:35,960 --> 01:36:40,130
But today Gingiss comms not offensive
like you could bring up gaviscon nobody

2218
01:36:40,131 --> 01:36:43,580
cares me weighing more horrific than
anything that happened during the civil

2219
01:36:43,580 --> 01:36:45,430
war.
They had slaves and they,

2220
01:36:45,650 --> 01:36:48,710
they did everything they used.
They would capture people and use them

2221
01:36:48,711 --> 01:36:50,930
as the front line.
They'd push them towards their own

2222
01:36:50,931 --> 01:36:53,570
people so they would get shot.
They will be the first people to get

2223
01:36:53,571 --> 01:36:57,920
shot with arrows and I mean there's some
horrific shit but I think the think we

2224
01:36:57,921 --> 01:37:01,610
shared melt gingiss con statues.
I think the confederacy is just so much

2225
01:37:01,940 --> 01:37:05,360
more recent and do something with it
though.

2226
01:37:05,570 --> 01:37:08,060
I mean I don't think it should be in
town square for sure.

2227
01:37:08,270 --> 01:37:09,450
In anybody's townsquared.
Yeah,

2228
01:37:09,530 --> 01:37:12,170
but I think they should do something
with them instead of melting them are

2229
01:37:12,171 --> 01:37:14,780
smashing them.
They should put them somewhere at least

2230
01:37:14,781 --> 01:37:17,870
for the future.
At least for future people to like look

2231
01:37:17,871 --> 01:37:18,110
back.

2232
01:37:18,110 --> 01:37:18,770
Like,
look,

2233
01:37:18,770 --> 01:37:23,630
this is how fucking wacky people were in
the 1960s they construct these Omadjela

2234
01:37:23,631 --> 01:37:25,880
has to the 18 hundreds and slavery was
legal.

2235
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:31,000
They constructed these statues to sort
of paint these people in this heroic

2236
01:37:32,901 --> 01:37:36,770
fashion that we're fighting to keep
black people slaves.

2237
01:37:36,771 --> 01:37:38,300
That's part of the thing.
There was,

2238
01:37:38,570 --> 01:37:40,670
this is all right,
there's a part of the history of this

2239
01:37:40,760 --> 01:37:42,440
country.
We've got to put it somewhere.

2240
01:37:42,710 --> 01:37:44,450
I mean,
I'm not saying that should be worshiped.

2241
01:37:44,690 --> 01:37:46,760
Definitely shouldn't be prominently
featured.

2242
01:37:46,761 --> 01:37:49,040
So some black kid has to filter.
Yeah,

2243
01:37:49,570 --> 01:37:51,350
there should be something like that.
Right?

2244
01:37:51,410 --> 01:37:55,500
Yeah,
and but it should be like detailed of

2245
01:37:55,590 --> 01:37:56,040
when it was

2246
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:59,160
constructed,
it was an instructor who made it.

2247
01:37:59,161 --> 01:38:01,470
What was the political affiliation of
the people that created it?

2248
01:38:01,500 --> 01:38:02,380
Totally.
Yeah.

2249
01:38:02,430 --> 01:38:04,860
Totally stopped us.
Whitewash whitewashing bullshit like

2250
01:38:04,861 --> 01:38:07,140
that.
Every time mlk day comes around,

2251
01:38:07,141 --> 01:38:10,620
I'm always just like,
did you know mlk was like a rabid anti

2252
01:38:10,621 --> 01:38:13,200
militarist and anti imperialist?
No,

2253
01:38:13,350 --> 01:38:15,600
because they,
he was the most hated black man in

2254
01:38:15,601 --> 01:38:16,780
America.
Someone said,

2255
01:38:16,950 --> 01:38:18,710
know that he used to fuck all these
white women,

2256
01:38:18,711 --> 01:38:21,890
like who does only fucking white women.
It gives a flat of funny did.

2257
01:38:22,720 --> 01:38:23,790
Personally.
I can a time

2258
01:38:26,370 --> 01:38:29,160
that's going to be the bad day.
Oh well you just turned it around for

2259
01:38:29,161 --> 01:38:30,930
me.
Fuck mlk.

2260
01:38:30,931 --> 01:38:35,931
That I have a dream.
It's so strange that people,

2261
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:40,200
they turn on things.
What do you think about this whole like

2262
01:38:40,201 --> 01:38:44,250
dueling narrative though about trump?
Like how he's somehow absolved from all

2263
01:38:44,251 --> 01:38:46,650
of his wrongdoings or he's a Russian
plant?

2264
01:38:46,680 --> 01:38:50,000
Like are you having trouble talking to
people about that?

2265
01:38:50,280 --> 01:38:51,720
Well,
what do you think?

2266
01:38:51,870 --> 01:38:53,820
Well,
I think the good thing about him,

2267
01:38:54,090 --> 01:38:59,090
this is the good thing is that we
realize now how easy it is for a person

2268
01:38:59,611 --> 01:39:03,600
to win the popularity contest that is
the presidency of the United States and

2269
01:39:03,601 --> 01:39:06,660
that you could get a popular person,
whether it's trump or whether it's oprah

2270
01:39:06,661 --> 01:39:08,550
or whoever the fuck it is that decides
to win next.

2271
01:39:08,760 --> 01:39:13,760
And this is a ridiculous way to pick the
person who runs the biggest fucking

2272
01:39:13,891 --> 01:39:16,260
military complex the world has ever
known.

2273
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:19,290
I mean,
the greatest army the world has ever

2274
01:39:19,291 --> 01:39:21,420
known by far is the United States
military.

2275
01:39:21,540 --> 01:39:24,870
The commander in chief is now,
the guy was the host of the apprentice

2276
01:39:24,871 --> 01:39:26,700
that was famous for saying,
you're fired.

2277
01:39:26,940 --> 01:39:28,170
You're fired.
I mean,

2278
01:39:28,190 --> 01:39:28,800
he's,
this is,

2279
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:31,140
this is a popularity contest.
It's insane.

2280
01:39:31,290 --> 01:39:33,360
You don't have to have special
qualifications.

2281
01:39:33,480 --> 01:39:35,310
You just have to be deemed the people
that,

2282
01:39:35,410 --> 01:39:37,080
the person that people like the most.

2283
01:39:37,080 --> 01:39:38,130
Yeah.
That's insane.

2284
01:39:38,250 --> 01:39:42,090
It's also insane to have one giant Alpha
chimp to be the top guy.

2285
01:39:42,110 --> 01:39:44,640
Right.
Or the top gal to run the whole project.

2286
01:39:44,760 --> 01:39:47,040
And I saw that with Hillary too.
There was so many people that were

2287
01:39:47,041 --> 01:39:50,040
looking for Hillary to win because they
wanted a woman to win because they

2288
01:39:50,041 --> 01:39:53,670
thought it would be historic victory
regardless of how fucking creepy she is,

2289
01:39:53,850 --> 01:39:55,830
regardless of all the crazy shit that
she's done,

2290
01:39:55,920 --> 01:39:59,610
regardless of her history,
regardless of all the fucking way that

2291
01:39:59,611 --> 01:40:03,930
they hacked the DNC.
And they literally conspired to keep

2292
01:40:03,931 --> 01:40:05,670
Bernie Sanders from winning the
nomination.

2293
01:40:05,700 --> 01:40:08,400
I mean,
they hacked the democracy.

2294
01:40:08,430 --> 01:40:10,080
They did it,
not the Russians.

2295
01:40:10,230 --> 01:40:10,740
And everybody's like,
like,

2296
01:40:10,740 --> 01:40:11,241
yeah,
yeah,

2297
01:40:11,241 --> 01:40:12,930
yeah.
It didn't work.

2298
01:40:12,931 --> 01:40:14,700
Doesn't even count.
Screw voter ID,

2299
01:40:14,701 --> 01:40:16,080
voter suppression,
all that Shit.

2300
01:40:16,081 --> 01:40:20,320
Gerrymandering woman's so bad that they
were willing to look to sleep.

2301
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:22,410
And then while the gay person next,
you know,

2302
01:40:22,411 --> 01:40:25,360
the black person and a woman,
our trans persons person,

2303
01:40:26,160 --> 01:40:28,470
I mean honestly,
and that's the problem.

2304
01:40:28,471 --> 01:40:31,890
I think that's the conflation with like
the left and the neo liberal think

2305
01:40:31,891 --> 01:40:35,400
tankers is that they use identity
politics to sell more corporatism.

2306
01:40:35,490 --> 01:40:40,490
Like they use it to brand slap pink shit
on Boeing jets and be like women's Day.

2307
01:40:42,810 --> 01:40:46,080
But it's not like they actually care
about oppressed and marginalized people.

2308
01:40:46,081 --> 01:40:48,420
So it's,
it's really interesting.

2309
01:40:48,480 --> 01:40:52,090
We're in an infancy.
The infancy of understanding really are,

2310
01:40:52,210 --> 01:40:53,280
I mean,
three people ago,

2311
01:40:53,320 --> 01:40:56,070
three people go and it's like three
people from now or,

2312
01:40:56,071 --> 01:41:00,800
but like these fucking apes were crazy.
I really do think that.

2313
01:41:01,930 --> 01:41:03,430
Yeah,
I think we're in the middle of it.

2314
01:41:03,431 --> 01:41:04,660
You know,
whether it's the apprentice guy,

2315
01:41:04,661 --> 01:41:05,530
I mean,
if he didn't win,

2316
01:41:05,531 --> 01:41:07,240
what would you want?
Fucking Ted Cruz to win?

2317
01:41:07,270 --> 01:41:09,250
Get the fuck out of here.
Out of his mind too.

2318
01:41:09,520 --> 01:41:11,590
And now all he's doing is sucking
trump's ass.

2319
01:41:11,770 --> 01:41:13,570
You see all those speeches about him,
dude,

2320
01:41:13,660 --> 01:41:16,990
crazy.
Trump calls his wife a dog that says his

2321
01:41:16,991 --> 01:41:19,450
dad killed jfk and just,
and Ted Cruz is like,

2322
01:41:19,451 --> 01:41:21,310
you know what,
I'm I really like him now.

2323
01:41:21,670 --> 01:41:22,503
Yeah.
Lion Chair.

2324
01:41:23,330 --> 01:41:25,660
I love how he calls people at name like
crazy.

2325
01:41:25,661 --> 01:41:28,350
Hillary lying ted.
He gives him a name.

2326
01:41:28,850 --> 01:41:31,600
Just a lot of things that he does that I
wish he wasn't the president.

2327
01:41:31,780 --> 01:41:34,720
I wish I could just laugh at some of the
things he does and I wouldn't feel bad

2328
01:41:34,721 --> 01:41:35,400
about it.
Right.

2329
01:41:35,400 --> 01:41:36,910
You know,
cause he's a fucking loon.

2330
01:41:37,030 --> 01:41:38,970
I mean,
he's a crazy old rich dude.

2331
01:41:38,980 --> 01:41:42,490
He does a bunch of wacky shit that I
find to be incredibly entertaining.

2332
01:41:42,700 --> 01:41:44,460
If he wasn't the leader of the free
world,

2333
01:41:44,530 --> 01:41:46,510
he wasn't in fucking power.
I mean,

2334
01:41:46,511 --> 01:41:48,730
I think if wants to be there either if
trauma,

2335
01:41:48,731 --> 01:41:50,550
Paul Ryan didn't want to be there
anymore,

2336
01:41:50,560 --> 01:41:53,380
you probably got some sweet ass deal
with some big Pharma lobby or something.

2337
01:41:53,381 --> 01:41:55,930
He's probably realizing like the
writing's on the wall for him.

2338
01:41:56,410 --> 01:41:57,071
He's like,
oh,

2339
01:41:57,071 --> 01:41:59,530
I see what happens if your president
fuck this.

2340
01:41:59,710 --> 01:42:03,160
I'm catching radiation sickness just for
being on the outside check waiting for

2341
01:42:03,161 --> 01:42:04,240
me.
Um,

2342
01:42:04,780 --> 01:42:05,920
I'm gonna go fishing,
but,

2343
01:42:05,921 --> 01:42:06,650
uh,
I don't,

2344
01:42:06,650 --> 01:42:08,860
I think the Democrats are so stupid,
Joe,

2345
01:42:08,861 --> 01:42:12,850
that you even saw their slogan come up
for 2018 at the literally said,

2346
01:42:12,851 --> 01:42:16,990
look at the other guy that was there.
That's the genius slogan.

2347
01:42:17,050 --> 01:42:18,940
Look at the other end to do the same
thing.

2348
01:42:19,180 --> 01:42:21,160
They're going to do the same thing.
Trump is gonna win again.

2349
01:42:21,790 --> 01:42:23,590
Guaranteed.
I guarantee you,

2350
01:42:23,591 --> 01:42:27,190
unless they really let Bernie Sanders,
uh,

2351
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:30,610
take the reins and I just feel like
they're too threatened by his economic

2352
01:42:30,611 --> 01:42:34,210
policies that they're not going to buy
the time Bernie wins his head will be

2353
01:42:34,480 --> 01:42:37,210
right.
[inaudible] his head just keeps sinking

2354
01:42:37,211 --> 01:42:38,330
further,
further down.

2355
01:42:38,350 --> 01:42:43,030
Just keeps getting more.
Every bloody I'll go into you all the

2356
01:42:43,031 --> 01:42:44,620
job.
That's his latest one.

2357
01:42:44,920 --> 01:42:47,380
He wants to guarantee a job.
Who's going to make these jobs?

2358
01:42:47,381 --> 01:42:51,130
Birdie you fuck you don't know shit.
But looking at say that you can't see,

2359
01:42:51,131 --> 01:42:53,650
you're going to guarantee a job cause
who's gonna make the jobs?

2360
01:42:53,740 --> 01:42:55,500
You're just going to make up jobs.
What are you going to do?

2361
01:42:55,501 --> 01:42:57,400
We're going to get that money.
You get to take it from me and give it

2362
01:42:57,401 --> 01:42:59,050
to people because you have give him a
fake job.

2363
01:42:59,070 --> 01:43:00,130
Yeah.
What are you going to do?

2364
01:43:00,250 --> 01:43:03,040
How can you say,
I'm going to guarantee every American a

2365
01:43:03,041 --> 01:43:06,100
job that is a fucking insane thing to
Suzie said how?

2366
01:43:06,430 --> 01:43:07,810
No,
because here's the thing.

2367
01:43:07,870 --> 01:43:11,380
What if you just wait and you just like,
you don't want to do shit.

2368
01:43:11,381 --> 01:43:12,970
You're lazy.
You're a fuck up.

2369
01:43:13,030 --> 01:43:14,960
Well,
I guaranteed everyone a job,

2370
01:43:16,360 --> 01:43:18,880
but I got fired.
You guaranteed me a job here.

2371
01:43:18,881 --> 01:43:20,620
Then another job,
I don't want to be a liar.

2372
01:43:20,830 --> 01:43:22,690
Like what are you going to do?
How are you going to give everyone a

2373
01:43:22,691 --> 01:43:24,970
job?
It's literally not possible.

2374
01:43:25,030 --> 01:43:29,260
That's a fucking insane thing to say.
I guarantee a job for everybody know

2375
01:43:29,270 --> 01:43:30,670
it's not in the same.
Those same.

2376
01:43:30,700 --> 01:43:33,100
The other shit that he says,
I mean he's been out in the floor.

2377
01:43:33,101 --> 01:43:35,200
You have to give him credit for the last
30 years,

2378
01:43:35,290 --> 01:43:37,750
whether it be Gulf War syndrome,
like Gmos.

2379
01:43:37,750 --> 01:43:40,490
I mean he's out there fighting for,
he's

2380
01:43:42,100 --> 01:43:43,450
like,
it's important to have pe.

2381
01:43:44,070 --> 01:43:46,720
You have to have like both sides.
You have to have radical,

2382
01:43:46,721 --> 01:43:49,150
right radical left and let's meet all
somewhere in the middle,

2383
01:43:49,210 --> 01:43:50,890
you know.
But if you look at like Europe and

2384
01:43:50,891 --> 01:43:52,910
other,
he is considered probably center.

2385
01:43:53,530 --> 01:43:54,890
Yeah.
Like you look at Jeremy Corbyn,

2386
01:43:54,891 --> 01:43:56,210
he is like,
he's,

2387
01:43:56,211 --> 01:43:58,160
he's Bernie Sanders on steroids where
he,

2388
01:43:58,220 --> 01:44:00,050
he's,
he's in Britain.

2389
01:44:00,630 --> 01:44:01,520
Yeah.
Yeah.

2390
01:44:01,640 --> 01:44:03,290
And he's called a Russian,
right?

2391
01:44:04,060 --> 01:44:04,893
Yeah.
Dude.

2392
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:06,890
But I'm,
what's crazy about the hillary

2393
01:44:06,950 --> 01:44:09,350
sycophants is like,
you see Neera Tanden and all these

2394
01:44:09,351 --> 01:44:13,130
assholes who worked for Hillary
Clinton's campaign on the fucking eve of

2395
01:44:13,131 --> 01:44:14,870
trump bombing Syria.
They're like,

2396
01:44:14,871 --> 01:44:17,000
thanks Susan.
Surandon thanks a lot.

2397
01:44:17,480 --> 01:44:19,070
Great job.
It's like,

2398
01:44:19,100 --> 01:44:21,020
Oh,
I'm sorry Susan Surandon made trump bump

2399
01:44:21,030 --> 01:44:24,090
series.
Dick was random.

2400
01:44:24,150 --> 01:44:25,760
Did it.
Thanks.

2401
01:44:26,280 --> 01:44:27,590
And it's also like Hillary would've
been,

2402
01:44:27,700 --> 01:44:29,960
would've been bombing Syria very
quickly.

2403
01:44:30,350 --> 01:44:32,610
She called for a no fly zone.
He's got a big Dick.

2404
01:44:32,900 --> 01:44:33,591
I mean,
you remember the,

2405
01:44:33,591 --> 01:44:36,170
I mean,
everybody quickly forgets that Kadafi

2406
01:44:36,170 --> 01:44:37,250
Shit.
She was laughing,

2407
01:44:37,730 --> 01:44:38,810
laughing,
laughing.

2408
01:44:38,811 --> 01:44:40,740
We came,
we saw he died.

2409
01:44:40,820 --> 01:44:43,160
Hahaha.
Like who are you?

2410
01:44:43,370 --> 01:44:46,970
The what person laughs like that when
someone gets killed.

2411
01:44:47,150 --> 01:44:50,480
Even if bill cosby,
if some woman who bill cosby raped

2412
01:44:50,600 --> 01:44:53,840
showed up outside the courtroom and he
was walking down the stairs and she ran

2413
01:44:53,841 --> 01:44:56,930
up,
leave Harvey Oswald Jack Ruby Style and

2414
01:44:56,931 --> 01:44:59,240
shot him right in the chest.
I wouldn't laugh.

2415
01:44:59,450 --> 01:45:00,710
I'd be like,
Whoa,

2416
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:03,610
that's fucking crazy.
I wouldn't be like,

2417
01:45:04,900 --> 01:45:07,430
she saw he's done.
Where's your pills now?

2418
01:45:07,480 --> 01:45:08,430
Faggot.
No,

2419
01:45:08,500 --> 01:45:10,400
I wouldn't say that.
I would be,

2420
01:45:10,460 --> 01:45:11,930
I would be freaking out.
It'd be like,

2421
01:45:11,960 --> 01:45:14,210
wow,
that guy just lost his like what a crazy

2422
01:45:14,211 --> 01:45:19,010
life that God,
that guy's life was like this magical

2423
01:45:19,011 --> 01:45:23,810
ride of celebrity until he got busted
raping people and then the last years of

2424
01:45:23,811 --> 01:45:28,290
his life were in helacious state of
being accused of something and,

2425
01:45:28,490 --> 01:45:30,890
and probably only got a fraction of what
he was actually,

2426
01:45:31,040 --> 01:45:32,120
what he actually did.

2427
01:45:32,120 --> 01:45:33,740
I mean,
how many women out there know that they

2428
01:45:33,741 --> 01:45:36,920
were raped by him and just said nothing
because they just don't,

2429
01:45:36,921 --> 01:45:38,490
they don't want to be a part of it.
The big.

2430
01:45:38,590 --> 01:45:41,120
Exactly.
And how many victims are there already?

2431
01:45:41,121 --> 01:45:46,121
Fuck is at least 50 at least 50 fucking
than Weinstein.

2432
01:45:46,521 --> 01:45:48,950
Is there anyone else that's that much of
a serial rapist?

2433
01:45:48,980 --> 01:45:51,170
She bit,
the Weinstein thing was like he was

2434
01:45:51,171 --> 01:45:54,470
forcing them to have sex with him in
order to give them roles.

2435
01:45:54,471 --> 01:45:56,180
Right.
He wasn't drugging them.

2436
01:45:56,181 --> 01:46:00,290
It's just as creepy in a way,
but it's not quite the same thing

2437
01:46:00,291 --> 01:46:05,170
because bill cosby was almost like a
monster or you know,

2438
01:46:05,360 --> 01:46:08,900
like fucking did to you while you were
passed out for a day in his house.

2439
01:46:09,110 --> 01:46:12,610
But he's also,
the way you posed at like Weinstein was

2440
01:46:12,620 --> 01:46:15,990
this fat gross got like Shrek
personified newman.

2441
01:46:16,050 --> 01:46:17,300
We was everybody.

2442
01:46:17,300 --> 01:46:18,820
Everybody knew.
Stay the fuck away from him.

2443
01:46:18,830 --> 01:46:20,400
Right up to his room.
He's a monster.

2444
01:46:20,660 --> 01:46:23,270
That was the whole thing with that guy.
But what,

2445
01:46:23,420 --> 01:46:28,420
what bill cosby was with this moral
voice of Black America back your pants

2446
01:46:28,701 --> 01:46:29,451
up.
Yeah.

2447
01:46:29,451 --> 01:46:30,560
Don't,
don't you have those,

2448
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:34,190
those sagging jeans using all those bad
words.

2449
01:46:34,330 --> 01:46:35,810
Do you remember?
It was we were talking about before.

2450
01:46:35,990 --> 01:46:38,990
Do you remember the Eddie Murphy thing
where he called up at?

2451
01:46:38,991 --> 01:46:41,750
Eddie Murphy had it in his movie raw,
right.

2452
01:46:41,751 --> 01:46:44,590
It was in raw or delirious.
Might've been till years.

2453
01:46:44,650 --> 01:46:48,200
So fucking good.
But Oh man,

2454
01:46:48,230 --> 01:46:51,450
he got a call running a wire.
He called up Richard Pryor.

2455
01:46:51,510 --> 01:46:53,850
See you can find that.
So you would find that online.

2456
01:46:54,300 --> 01:46:59,300
Eddie Murphy on Bill Cosby because
Richard Pryor talk shit to bill cosby.

2457
01:47:02,100 --> 01:47:05,340
Bill cosby wasn't half the fucking
comedian that Richard Pryor was.

2458
01:47:05,341 --> 01:47:06,570
Yeah,
I'm sure that bothered,

2459
01:47:06,571 --> 01:47:07,480
I'm here.
Let's play this.

2460
01:47:08,330 --> 01:47:11,520
I've been not thinking this outfit down.
Bill College,

2461
01:47:11,800 --> 01:47:16,260
he has a good outfit and chastise me on
the phone for being too dirty on a stage

2462
01:47:16,261 --> 01:47:19,290
and it was real weird because I haven't
met him and he just started was you

2463
01:47:19,291 --> 01:47:23,310
should call me up because he was bill
and tell me that he did about what

2464
01:47:23,311 --> 01:47:25,680
comedy is all about.
And I sat and listened to this man

2465
01:47:25,710 --> 01:47:29,340
chastise me and with good cause the
chest as you used to get you grown,

2466
01:47:29,341 --> 01:47:34,341
you feel like one of the cosby kids
and picked up the telephone and bill got

2467
01:47:35,401 --> 01:47:36,270
Rohem y'all.
I was like,

2468
01:47:36,271 --> 01:47:37,620
Hello Mr Cosby in here.

2469
01:47:37,890 --> 01:47:42,890
I put like
how good Eddie Murphy was.

2470
01:48:00,690 --> 01:48:02,520
I'd love to tell you,
start

2471
01:48:04,490 --> 01:48:05,720
to tell you the story.

2472
01:48:09,740 --> 01:48:12,540
Children.
What did you go fly

2473
01:48:15,920 --> 01:48:20,270
in Massachusetts with?
Good meal and my five

2474
01:48:24,950 --> 01:48:25,783
children

2475
01:48:27,260 --> 01:48:30,920
and the boy,
the boy's name is everything you do.

2476
01:48:31,070 --> 01:48:34,940
Come talk from school the other day with
a big smile on his face in my son.

2477
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:38,570
Looks just like me.
He walks through the door looking at me

2478
01:48:38,571 --> 01:48:39,404
with this.

2479
01:48:40,880 --> 01:48:42,120
I could not resist.

2480
01:48:46,550 --> 01:48:48,900
Walks up and I say,
what are you smiling?

2481
01:48:49,560 --> 01:48:53,860
Aw,
Joe says to me,

2482
01:48:53,861 --> 01:48:58,150
I'm smiling because I need money to go
see the energy back to the show.

2483
01:48:58,151 --> 01:49:03,151
Please give me money
if the child is smiling this way because

2484
01:49:04,480 --> 01:49:08,040
he needs
to get them.

2485
01:49:10,300 --> 01:49:15,280
I do not handle the money in the house.
My wife handles the ticket money,

2486
01:49:15,420 --> 01:49:16,430
so I must go

2487
01:49:18,830 --> 01:49:23,830
the family,
the eighties dude,

2488
01:49:24,810 --> 01:49:25,490
God,
I miss the,

2489
01:49:25,490 --> 01:49:27,460
anyway,
it is a long bit.

2490
01:49:27,461 --> 01:49:29,270
It's like six minutes,
50 seconds.

2491
01:49:29,380 --> 01:49:31,870
It's great.
Basically calls up Richard Pryor.

2492
01:49:31,900 --> 01:49:32,830
Yeah,
and he goes,

2493
01:49:32,831 --> 01:49:34,480
uh,
Richard Pryor said,

2494
01:49:34,930 --> 01:49:37,510
do the people,
do you get paid?

2495
01:49:37,720 --> 01:49:40,030
We'll tell bill to have a coke and a
smile and shut the fuck up.

2496
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:44,760
But that was really,
really,

2497
01:49:45,640 --> 01:49:47,140
really did call him up.
Meanwhile,

2498
01:49:47,170 --> 01:49:48,190
while Eddie Murphy

2499
01:49:48,190 --> 01:49:49,960
was doing that,
you got to realize this is the 80s,

2500
01:49:49,961 --> 01:49:51,790
right?
So while Eddie Murphy was doing that

2501
01:49:51,791 --> 01:49:54,820
sketch bill cosby,
very likely it was probably raping

2502
01:49:54,821 --> 01:49:55,570
somebody.
Oh,

2503
01:49:55,570 --> 01:49:56,403
absolutely.

2504
01:49:56,490 --> 01:49:57,330
Plastic.
Very raping them.

2505
01:49:57,331 --> 01:49:58,950
Them the,
as he was on the stage.

2506
01:49:58,951 --> 01:50:00,050
It's entirely possible.
Yeah.

2507
01:50:00,270 --> 01:50:02,430
I know.
I just saw Whoopi Goldberg,

2508
01:50:03,360 --> 01:50:04,400
uh,
do stand up.

2509
01:50:04,470 --> 01:50:06,090
Have you seen her recently?
No,

2510
01:50:06,300 --> 01:50:09,200
it was really interesting.
I mean she's going back to the horse

2511
01:50:09,201 --> 01:50:11,700
just talking about her pussy.
Well yeah,

2512
01:50:11,701 --> 01:50:12,361
no,
it was crazy.

2513
01:50:12,361 --> 01:50:14,520
I thought she was going to talk about
trump or assumption.

2514
01:50:14,521 --> 01:50:19,410
She came out talking about her vagina's
sows so dry that she has sand coming out

2515
01:50:19,411 --> 01:50:22,800
of it.
And then I saw in vegas it was,

2516
01:50:22,801 --> 01:50:24,990
it was really,
was it good?

2517
01:50:25,820 --> 01:50:27,550
Um,
it was interesting to see.

2518
01:50:28,250 --> 01:50:29,660
It's interesting to see will be
governed,

2519
01:50:29,661 --> 01:50:33,110
be like extremely fucking dirty,
but it was also a thing.

2520
01:50:33,840 --> 01:50:36,270
Yeah.
Uncomfortably in a lot of,

2521
01:50:37,850 --> 01:50:39,660
um,
but then she opened it up to q and a,

2522
01:50:39,661 --> 01:50:41,640
which I thought was weird.
Oh yeah.

2523
01:50:42,270 --> 01:50:43,290
Yeah.
How'd she do that?

2524
01:50:43,291 --> 01:50:44,550
Did you have a line of people and she
just,

2525
01:50:44,730 --> 01:50:45,520
she went a second,
you know,

2526
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:46,860
now I'm going to open it up.
She's like,

2527
01:50:46,861 --> 01:50:48,090
ask,
ask me anything.

2528
01:50:48,091 --> 01:50:49,650
And I was like,
I don't know what the fuck.

2529
01:50:49,680 --> 01:50:51,450
Like what are people going to ask you?
People were like,

2530
01:50:51,451 --> 01:50:54,000
how,
how was a ghost?

2531
01:50:54,690 --> 01:50:56,580
What's it like working with those cons
on the view?

2532
01:51:02,160 --> 01:51:04,580
How do not murder Megan Mccain when
you're sitting next to her?

2533
01:51:04,670 --> 01:51:08,820
Who was the one that she used to always
get no hassle that whatever happened in

2534
01:51:08,821 --> 01:51:11,970
that Gal that got replaced by John
Mccain's daughter,

2535
01:51:11,971 --> 01:51:13,920
I guess.
How the hell is John Mccain still alive?

2536
01:51:13,921 --> 01:51:15,150
He's had brain cancer for like a year.

2537
01:51:15,680 --> 01:51:18,170
Can I get some mark surgery?
It's got some new surgery,

2538
01:51:18,171 --> 01:51:22,190
like gut surgery coming his brain.
It's got something going on in his gut.

2539
01:51:22,220 --> 01:51:23,930
It's going to have to get in test really
surgery.

2540
01:51:23,960 --> 01:51:26,000
Yeah.
Serious Shit.

2541
01:51:26,420 --> 01:51:28,670
Um,
what that Elizabeth hackle Hasselbeck

2542
01:51:28,671 --> 01:51:31,550
chick.
She was like the original Megan Kelly.

2543
01:51:31,580 --> 01:51:34,670
Yeah,
like the original hot blonde mean lady.

2544
01:51:35,010 --> 01:51:37,610
You know the hot blonde mean
conservative lady.

2545
01:51:38,650 --> 01:51:42,590
Just shut your ass down.
So fucking market for those hot blonde

2546
01:51:42,591 --> 01:51:45,060
mean conservative ladies at tough
market.

2547
01:51:45,290 --> 01:51:46,310
Good market.
Yup.

2548
01:51:46,460 --> 01:51:47,293
You know,

2549
01:51:47,510 --> 01:51:49,230
again,
filling that vacuum,

2550
01:51:49,231 --> 01:51:52,260
the Tommy Lauren's,
they love it.

2551
01:51:52,380 --> 01:51:56,340
Get pull yourself up by your bootstraps.
How weird is it that Megan Kelly's just

2552
01:51:56,341 --> 01:51:59,640
now this like weird talk show host?
Just a normal like an ellen.

2553
01:51:59,670 --> 01:52:01,090
She's like trying to rebrand ourself as
an allen.

2554
01:52:01,091 --> 01:52:04,440
It's like you cannot go from like Fox
News mouthpiece,

2555
01:52:05,360 --> 01:52:07,770
you know,
frothing at the mouth about all the shit

2556
01:52:07,771 --> 01:52:08,670
to just being like,
hey,

2557
01:52:08,671 --> 01:52:10,980
let's just talk about your relationship
problems.

2558
01:52:10,981 --> 01:52:12,150
There's just an odd switch.
Yeah.

2559
01:52:12,151 --> 01:52:13,000
But I don't buy it.

2560
01:52:13,370 --> 01:52:15,500
Fangs come out every now and then.
Yeah.

2561
01:52:15,530 --> 01:52:18,340
The Jane Fonda Shit.
You know what the Jane Fonda Shit,

2562
01:52:18,470 --> 01:52:21,700
she asked Jane Fonda about plastic
surgery and Jane Fonda,

2563
01:52:23,510 --> 01:52:25,120
fuck you asking me about plastic
surgery.

2564
01:52:25,140 --> 01:52:26,340
I'm here to promote a movie,
right?

2565
01:52:26,620 --> 01:52:27,770
Oh,
we have three minutes.

2566
01:52:28,090 --> 01:52:29,690
You know what would I look good?
Yeah,

2567
01:52:29,700 --> 01:52:32,750
but except that she's talked about
having plastic surgery.

2568
01:52:32,751 --> 01:52:34,120
So why,
why?

2569
01:52:34,480 --> 01:52:36,170
That's a weird,
because she's,

2570
01:52:36,500 --> 01:52:37,860
this is not organic,
right?

2571
01:52:37,880 --> 01:52:39,920
These shows are not,
or it's not a podcast.

2572
01:52:39,921 --> 01:52:41,050
I'm just sitting down talking.
Yeah.

2573
01:52:41,060 --> 01:52:45,560
So she wants to get some sound bite and
this is probably like part the agenda.

2574
01:52:45,561 --> 01:52:49,310
So Jane Fonda's shut her down and just
start talking about the movie again and

2575
01:52:49,311 --> 01:52:53,030
then talked about her and so then later
on it looks damn good.

2576
01:52:53,070 --> 01:52:57,120
She's not not bad for 150,000 years old.
So later,

2577
01:52:57,540 --> 01:53:02,540
later on Megan Kelly started talking
shit about Jane Fonda on the air saying

2578
01:53:04,131 --> 01:53:06,530
about how people used to call her
annoyed Jane.

2579
01:53:08,870 --> 01:53:13,610
Let's see the fans come out and utr
number when she said she had alluded to

2580
01:53:13,611 --> 01:53:15,920
the fact that trump poisoned her the
morning of the debate.

2581
01:53:15,980 --> 01:53:17,330
I think we talked about that.
What?

2582
01:53:17,840 --> 01:53:19,760
Yeah,
well she got coffee from some weird

2583
01:53:19,761 --> 01:53:23,390
driver the morning of the debate and we
already know that that crazy shit was

2584
01:53:23,391 --> 01:53:26,330
happening between her and trump.
And she said she got violently ill.

2585
01:53:26,331 --> 01:53:27,860
She was trying to tell him I don't drink
coffee.

2586
01:53:27,861 --> 01:53:28,680
And then he was like,
no drink.

2587
01:53:28,680 --> 01:53:31,190
It's good.
She drank the coffee got violently ill

2588
01:53:31,191 --> 01:53:33,830
and had to like sit next to a puke
bucket almost thinking that she would

2589
01:53:33,831 --> 01:53:36,410
have to cancel the debate.
Basically alluding to the fact that

2590
01:53:36,411 --> 01:53:40,430
trump might have poisoned her that day.
I swear on,

2591
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,790
I don't know.
I have never taken a coffee from some

2592
01:53:43,791 --> 01:53:45,770
strange way to force me to drink.
Right,

2593
01:53:45,771 --> 01:53:46,250
right,
right.

2594
01:53:46,250 --> 01:53:47,750
Yeah,
and I'm not as famous.

2595
01:53:47,790 --> 01:53:50,960
She's recanted it after he got elected,
maybe out of fear,

2596
01:53:50,961 --> 01:53:52,100
maybe she was like,
oh shit,

2597
01:53:52,190 --> 01:53:55,400
if he really did do this,
then a bull shit,

2598
01:53:55,401 --> 01:53:56,830
their pants.
Once he got elected,

2599
01:53:57,790 --> 01:54:01,520
scorched earth.
I mean he made a lot of enemies and a

2600
01:54:01,521 --> 01:54:02,840
lot of people made enemies with him.

2601
01:54:02,930 --> 01:54:06,980
It's going to be really interesting to
see what happens with all these criminal

2602
01:54:06,981 --> 01:54:10,670
charges and what's going to happen with
Colin and all these other people.

2603
01:54:10,690 --> 01:54:13,880
The Mueller investigation.
It's so strange because it's all just,

2604
01:54:14,260 --> 01:54:19,010
we're waiting for something to be highly
illegal and obvious and it's not yet.

2605
01:54:19,011 --> 01:54:20,090
So I'm like,
where's the thing?

2606
01:54:20,240 --> 01:54:22,520
And when the thing comes out and people
start going down,

2607
01:54:22,521 --> 01:54:24,190
they start going to jail.
Well,

2608
01:54:24,200 --> 01:54:26,000
who's going to rat him out?
What's going to happen?

2609
01:54:26,220 --> 01:54:27,450
I can get a part in them.
I mean,

2610
01:54:27,451 --> 01:54:31,560
that's going to impeach him.
You have to have a consensus in the

2611
01:54:31,561 --> 01:54:34,270
Republican majority Congress.
So I don't understand how that's going

2612
01:54:34,271 --> 01:54:36,210
to happen unless he perjures himself.
Right.

2613
01:54:36,211 --> 01:54:39,990
The perjury trap like Bill Clinton,
unless he says some shit on the stand.

2614
01:54:39,991 --> 01:54:42,210
But I think it that he's smart enough to
just say yes.

2615
01:54:42,211 --> 01:54:43,044
No,
I don't know.

2616
01:54:43,050 --> 01:54:45,880
Hopefully saying I want them to be
fucking nph.

2617
01:54:45,910 --> 01:54:47,410
I fucking hate that guy.
The trumps.

2618
01:54:47,411 --> 01:54:49,270
And people were saying that trump's
supporters,

2619
01:54:49,290 --> 01:54:52,830
hence to public and trump's supporters
are the ones that okayed the Mueller

2620
01:54:52,831 --> 01:54:55,560
raid on Cohen's office.
Right.

2621
01:54:55,620 --> 01:54:57,930
What do you mean do I miss that?
The,

2622
01:54:57,940 --> 01:55:00,390
the people that rated Mueller's office,
right.

2623
01:55:00,660 --> 01:55:05,660
That trump supporters,
republicans had to give the green light.

2624
01:55:06,620 --> 01:55:10,830
Oh yeah.
The judge was appointed by trump.

2625
01:55:10,920 --> 01:55:12,030
Ah,
yeah.

2626
01:55:12,150 --> 01:55:14,940
Yeah.
So this is like this.

2627
01:55:14,940 --> 01:55:16,890
There must have been overwhelming
evidence.

2628
01:55:16,891 --> 01:55:19,680
The crazy thing about this is it's
almost like game of thrones,

2629
01:55:19,681 --> 01:55:23,310
like it's playing out so slow and I was
like a year and a half.

2630
01:55:23,311 --> 01:55:24,600
And you're like,
where is the proof?

2631
01:55:25,380 --> 01:55:26,600
It's trays.
It,

2632
01:55:26,610 --> 01:55:30,390
it just keeps building and people keep
getting indicted and people keep getting

2633
01:55:30,470 --> 01:55:32,850
pulled in.
And Cohen just pleaded the fifth.

2634
01:55:32,851 --> 01:55:33,720
Right.
And is that what happened?

2635
01:55:33,721 --> 01:55:37,420
That little pussy cushner gets indicted
for something man that have you heard

2636
01:55:37,510 --> 01:55:39,900
the one speech he gave and you've never
heard from him again?

2637
01:55:39,901 --> 01:55:41,520
Because his voice sounds like a little
mouse,

2638
01:55:41,521 --> 01:55:44,100
like rescue talk.
There's a good reason for that.

2639
01:55:44,100 --> 01:55:45,380
Can Be bad like this.
He's like,

2640
01:55:46,800 --> 01:55:49,260
he reminds me of American psycho.
Yeah,

2641
01:55:50,090 --> 01:55:50,970
totally.
Dude.

2642
01:55:51,060 --> 01:55:53,080
Just as there's a lot of audible,
like look,

2643
01:55:53,120 --> 01:55:55,350
looking at screens.
J.

2644
01:55:55,350 --> 01:55:57,600
Crew.
Oh God,

2645
01:55:57,601 --> 01:55:59,370
he's such a disgusting.
I'm there.

2646
01:55:59,640 --> 01:56:01,890
Let me hear it.
Let me get President Donald J.

2647
01:56:01,890 --> 01:56:05,100
Trump.
When my father in law decided to run for

2648
01:56:05,101 --> 01:56:08,550
president,
I served this campaign the best I could

2649
01:56:08,970 --> 01:56:12,570
because I believe in him and his ability
to improve the lives.

2650
01:56:14,130 --> 01:56:15,890
How does Donald let that guy fuck his
dog?

2651
01:56:17,150 --> 01:56:18,660
And he wants the Fucker,
right?

2652
01:56:18,661 --> 01:56:20,870
So it's like,
how are you letting this weird Guy

2653
01:56:20,870 --> 01:56:21,631
Fucker?
He only let some fucking,

2654
01:56:21,631 --> 01:56:23,970
only if I'm in the room,
they do it right.

2655
01:56:24,600 --> 01:56:27,120
Praiser
touch your feet.

2656
01:56:27,220 --> 01:56:28,680
I did not collude with Russia.
I like.

2657
01:56:29,070 --> 01:56:31,050
He's like,
I did not collude with Russia more than

2658
01:56:31,051 --> 01:56:32,470
I want to hear his voice.
Fast.

2659
01:56:32,670 --> 01:56:37,670
Americans and now serving the president
and the people of the United States has

2660
01:56:39,031 --> 01:56:41,790
been the honor and privilege of a
lifetime.

2661
01:56:41,940 --> 01:56:44,100
Oh my God,
I am so grateful.

2662
01:56:44,160 --> 01:56:46,600
I believe the opportunity.
I'm sold unimportant,

2663
01:56:46,980 --> 01:56:48,960
man.
Middle East peace.

2664
01:56:48,961 --> 01:56:53,550
Hold up and duck has a man of character.
She has a strong will.

2665
01:56:53,730 --> 01:56:55,930
I bet that motherfucker's never quits.
Middle East,

2666
01:56:56,240 --> 01:56:57,710
the Middle East,
conflict number.

2667
01:56:57,720 --> 01:56:58,471
When he was like,
you know what,

2668
01:56:58,471 --> 01:57:00,720
jared Kushner is actually going to solve
the peace between Israelis and

2669
01:57:00,721 --> 01:57:02,430
Palestinians.
Interesting.

2670
01:57:02,460 --> 01:57:04,560
I would like to see that guy hike with a
heavy backpack.

2671
01:57:04,920 --> 01:57:08,690
See how long before he starts crying?
I bet he's got about 14 minutes in them.

2672
01:57:09,270 --> 01:57:11,880
I want to see him.
Can you imagine him doing anything

2673
01:57:11,881 --> 01:57:14,490
strenuous at all?
His hands are probably like silk.

2674
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:19,530
They probably do this thing well,
the a little tiny hands.

2675
01:57:20,820 --> 01:57:23,730
He puts his hands in paraffin wax every
now and just let them sit.

2676
01:57:23,820 --> 01:57:26,540
Do you know he gets manicures for sure.
Oh Good God.

2677
01:57:26,550 --> 01:57:28,710
Strange,
strange character.

2678
01:57:28,860 --> 01:57:30,400
Probably gets a little facial every day.

2679
01:57:30,510 --> 01:57:32,070
His wife,
his wife is hot.

2680
01:57:32,790 --> 01:57:35,550
Donald's daughter is flushing.
She got a lot of work.

2681
01:57:35,551 --> 01:57:37,600
Tons.
Are we going to sound really whatever

2682
01:57:37,610 --> 01:57:40,190
I'm doing,
I'm not against getting work done style.

2683
01:57:40,740 --> 01:57:43,830
I don't know about that.
That's like weird shit.

2684
01:57:44,120 --> 01:57:47,920
That's like changing your ethnicity.
That's nuts.

2685
01:57:47,950 --> 01:57:49,530
But yeah,
jared Kushner is nuts.

2686
01:57:49,560 --> 01:57:51,030
Um,
all these people are men.

2687
01:57:51,120 --> 01:57:51,990
They have a kid,
right?

2688
01:57:52,380 --> 01:57:53,370
Oh,
they have a bunch.

2689
01:57:53,371 --> 01:57:57,930
I think they just had their third child
hammering it somehow there.

2690
01:57:58,250 --> 01:57:59,880
Look,
she's smoking hot.

2691
01:58:01,450 --> 01:58:03,630
Well you go,
what do you do if I were trump,

2692
01:58:03,631 --> 01:58:05,620
I don't want to fuck her too.
Woo.

2693
01:58:06,670 --> 01:58:07,380
No,
it's,

2694
01:58:07,380 --> 01:58:10,440
it's interesting too,
like stormy Daniels and the other woman

2695
01:58:10,441 --> 01:58:11,910
who said,
you know that she had an affair with

2696
01:58:11,911 --> 01:58:14,070
trump.
She said that both of them said that

2697
01:58:14,071 --> 01:58:15,960
trump told her,
you remind me of my daughter,

2698
01:58:15,961 --> 01:58:17,370
Ivanka,
you're beautiful and smart.

2699
01:58:17,640 --> 01:58:20,690
And then they had sex.
Hollow Holla,

2700
01:58:20,720 --> 01:58:22,590
play.
Can't bang new kid.

2701
01:58:22,830 --> 01:58:26,420
But you can bang someone who looks like,
Ooh.

2702
01:58:26,740 --> 01:58:28,800
Yeah.
I remember when Ted Cruz liked porn

2703
01:58:28,801 --> 01:58:30,090
treat.
Did he,

2704
01:58:30,840 --> 01:58:34,200
did he show he did that or saying in his
staff biggest fucking hand because the

2705
01:58:34,201 --> 01:58:36,660
woman in the porn video looked exactly
like his wife.

2706
01:58:36,661 --> 01:58:38,570
Oh Jesus.
Louisa's who,

2707
01:58:38,690 --> 01:58:39,300
what,
what,

2708
01:58:39,300 --> 01:58:41,500
what presidential candidate is ever
going to come out and say,

2709
01:58:41,501 --> 01:58:42,130
I just,
I love

2710
01:58:42,130 --> 01:58:42,970
porn.
It's great.

2711
01:58:43,110 --> 01:58:44,950
You know,
I can masturbate and then they'd be done

2712
01:58:44,951 --> 01:58:47,260
with it and I don't have to have sex
with anybody.

2713
01:58:47,320 --> 01:58:48,160
Yeah,
that's great.

2714
01:58:48,190 --> 01:58:48,731
Why not?
I mean,

2715
01:58:48,731 --> 01:58:50,650
well,
Obama admitted that he almost shot up

2716
01:58:50,651 --> 01:58:51,341
heroin.
It's like,

2717
01:58:51,341 --> 01:58:52,690
why couldn't trump have just said,
yeah,

2718
01:58:52,691 --> 01:58:56,170
I banged a porn star.
Who did he say he almost shot up heroin.

2719
01:58:56,180 --> 01:58:57,550
Said the needle was like,
oh yeah,

2720
01:58:57,551 --> 01:59:00,610
he said that he was almost going to do
it and he was sitting there and yeah,

2721
01:59:00,730 --> 01:59:02,110
that's heavy,
but like,

2722
01:59:02,111 --> 01:59:07,111
why did trump go through this whole nda
nonsense knowing that it could even him

2723
01:59:08,100 --> 01:59:09,000
vitamin the ass.
Yeah.

2724
01:59:09,001 --> 01:59:11,950
He probably thought that Michael Cohen
had it locked down and then,

2725
01:59:11,951 --> 01:59:14,470
you know,
they pay people off in the past.

2726
01:59:14,500 --> 01:59:17,950
I guess,
and it probably no one cared until he

2727
01:59:17,951 --> 01:59:19,160
became president.
Right.

2728
01:59:19,360 --> 01:59:20,710
What's your president?
And they're like,

2729
01:59:20,711 --> 01:59:22,990
oh,
the scrutiny is just so overwhelming.

2730
01:59:23,110 --> 01:59:24,460
I mean,
it's not just a scrutiny from the

2731
01:59:24,461 --> 01:59:26,570
American media,
it's the scrutiny all across the world.

2732
01:59:26,571 --> 01:59:26,921
Right.
I mean,

2733
01:59:26,921 --> 01:59:29,410
everybody's paying attention to
everything you've ever done,

2734
01:59:29,440 --> 01:59:30,670
ever.
And with him,

2735
01:59:31,030 --> 01:59:32,110
with him,
honestly,

2736
01:59:32,111 --> 01:59:35,740
the thing that scares me is not that,
the thing that scares me is all the

2737
01:59:35,741 --> 01:59:38,980
business deals.
What's crazy is how many small business

2738
01:59:38,981 --> 01:59:42,160
owners went under because trump had
these relationships,

2739
01:59:42,161 --> 01:59:43,540
apparently,
allegedly,

2740
01:59:43,570 --> 01:59:45,880
whatever I have to say with,
you know,

2741
01:59:45,881 --> 01:59:47,530
he would,
they would do these construction jobs

2742
01:59:47,531 --> 01:59:50,140
and small contractors,
which is not get paid.

2743
01:59:50,650 --> 01:59:52,750
And they would have to sue and they
would wind up going under.

2744
01:59:52,751 --> 01:59:54,400
They couldn't,
they couldn't compete with them.

2745
01:59:54,790 --> 01:59:57,610
And this is something that Joey Dee has
talked about on the podcast,

2746
01:59:57,611 --> 02:00:01,330
and he knew people that were involved
and construction companies that went

2747
02:00:01,331 --> 02:00:03,280
under because trump fuck them.
Oh Wow.

2748
02:00:03,310 --> 02:00:05,530
This is like a standard thing that he
would do back then.

2749
02:00:05,950 --> 02:00:07,600
Not pay people.
Damn.

2750
02:00:07,660 --> 02:00:08,081
Yeah.
I mean,

2751
02:00:08,081 --> 02:00:10,120
he had a reputation,
it's called Google.

2752
02:00:10,300 --> 02:00:14,500
Trump had a reputation for not paying
contractors,

2753
02:00:14,950 --> 02:00:17,200
construction contractors.
It was,

2754
02:00:17,530 --> 02:00:20,740
it was a real issue.
And it's an issue of character and

2755
02:00:20,741 --> 02:00:23,260
morals and ethics that is,
to me,

2756
02:00:23,470 --> 02:00:25,630
way more important than who he decides
to have sex.

2757
02:00:25,810 --> 02:00:28,720
Hundreds alleged.
Donald Trump doesn't pay his bills.

2758
02:00:29,620 --> 02:00:30,431
Oh God,
look at it.

2759
02:00:30,431 --> 02:00:31,930
It's all just what box?
Dishwasher.

2760
02:00:31,950 --> 02:00:34,740
Say billionaire didn't pay dishwashers.
Painters.

2761
02:00:34,741 --> 02:00:35,820
Waiters.
Yeah,

2762
02:00:35,950 --> 02:00:37,930
the lowly minions.
You know,

2763
02:00:37,931 --> 02:00:41,590
and then you know how much of that is,
he doesn't really pay because someone

2764
02:00:41,591 --> 02:00:43,720
else pays form and it got lost in the
shuffle.

2765
02:00:43,721 --> 02:00:46,310
And you know,
there's a giant slumlord too.

2766
02:00:46,330 --> 02:00:47,800
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

2767
02:00:48,100 --> 02:00:49,400
Yeah.
I mean it looks like a slumlord.

2768
02:00:49,890 --> 02:00:50,551
Criminals.
I mean,

2769
02:00:50,551 --> 02:00:54,370
you got to hear that guy being trump,
having as much money in property as you

2770
02:00:54,371 --> 02:00:56,890
do and not having any criminal activity.

2771
02:00:56,890 --> 02:00:59,410
I mean,
how the hell you can't be that fucking

2772
02:00:59,590 --> 02:01:01,900
be hard.
You'd have to know a few crooks,

2773
02:01:02,530 --> 02:01:04,960
you know,
and just the amount of money that's

2774
02:01:04,961 --> 02:01:07,270
involved,
like how the fuck can you pay attention

2775
02:01:07,271 --> 02:01:09,270
to all that?
Like you'd have to have someone like to

2776
02:01:09,310 --> 02:01:13,600
think that he's responsible for all that
is also naive honestly because if you

2777
02:01:13,601 --> 02:01:16,930
really look at the amount of properties
at trump owns and to think that he's

2778
02:01:16,931 --> 02:01:20,500
paying attention to all that and the
management of all that and the paying of

2779
02:01:20,501 --> 02:01:24,370
the contractors and all that,
but it probably trickles down from the

2780
02:01:24,371 --> 02:01:27,250
top right.
The kind of ethics that would be

2781
02:01:27,251 --> 02:01:31,870
involved and not paying off contractors.
That's like the whole Russia thing just

2782
02:01:31,871 --> 02:01:34,360
kills me because like we were saying,
it's been a year and a half.

2783
02:01:34,380 --> 02:01:37,680
There has been no smoking gun.
It's just a whole bunch of little things

2784
02:01:37,690 --> 02:01:39,560
like Oh,
Russian trolls online.

2785
02:01:39,620 --> 02:01:40,100
Right.

2786
02:01:40,100 --> 02:01:41,840
This,
that the DNI report,

2787
02:01:41,841 --> 02:01:43,050
which I was in,
um,

2788
02:01:43,070 --> 02:01:46,940
but no one is talking about the fact
that he obviously has ties with Saudi

2789
02:01:46,940 --> 02:01:47,773
Arabia,
Turkey,

2790
02:01:47,780 --> 02:01:48,890
Israel,
like all,

2791
02:01:48,920 --> 02:01:50,540
there's collusion with all these
countries.

2792
02:01:50,570 --> 02:01:52,190
Why just stop it?
Russia,

2793
02:01:52,220 --> 02:01:56,090
would you see what he said today?
He said that Komi lied and that he did

2794
02:01:56,091 --> 02:01:59,150
stay the night in Russia.
Komi lied in his memo.

2795
02:01:59,360 --> 02:02:00,260
That's me saying,
no,

2796
02:02:00,261 --> 02:02:02,150
I did not catch that.
This is the latest,

2797
02:02:02,180 --> 02:02:05,060
oh Ooh,
something happened.

2798
02:02:05,710 --> 02:02:07,250
He's realized that they,
they,

2799
02:02:07,520 --> 02:02:11,990
they found his flight records and they
realize that the jet was in Russia for

2800
02:02:11,991 --> 02:02:16,100
more than 24 hours.
So then he said call me lied.

2801
02:02:16,340 --> 02:02:18,590
I never said I didn't s stay the night
in Russia.

2802
02:02:19,310 --> 02:02:20,180
So it's like,
Ooh,

2803
02:02:20,181 --> 02:02:22,850
this is,
this is a strange move here.

2804
02:02:23,210 --> 02:02:26,390
Cause this is either check or checkmate.
Like this is a sneaky one.

2805
02:02:26,391 --> 02:02:28,900
Like what happens here?
Cause you're Colombian line.

2806
02:02:29,210 --> 02:02:31,790
If Komi lied,
the whole thing's fucked.

2807
02:02:31,850 --> 02:02:33,940
If comi really did lie,
mistake,

2808
02:02:33,980 --> 02:02:38,180
the whole thing's fucked.
And if trump lied and Komi somehow or

2809
02:02:38,181 --> 02:02:40,490
another have some recording or something
of it,

2810
02:02:40,580 --> 02:02:43,130
I don't know if that's the case.
It's awesome

2811
02:02:43,180 --> 02:02:44,290
juice.
I just don't think that,

2812
02:02:44,350 --> 02:02:46,210
yeah,
the Russia collusion thing,

2813
02:02:46,211 --> 02:02:49,180
it's like where is the smoking gun?
Or where is it?

2814
02:02:49,181 --> 02:02:50,800
I mean,
all we see are these,

2815
02:02:50,801 --> 02:02:54,400
this Hamilton 68 dashboard that's
literally run by the Chertoff Group.

2816
02:02:54,430 --> 02:02:57,760
Michael turned off was bushes,
dhs Hamilton 68 dash.

2817
02:02:57,761 --> 02:03:01,360
What's the think tank that you see
unquestioning needed repeated in every

2818
02:03:01,361 --> 02:03:04,450
single article about Russian trolls
where it's like Russian trolls are

2819
02:03:04,451 --> 02:03:09,220
spreading nra shit online to try to
foment discontent in this country are

2820
02:03:09,221 --> 02:03:12,310
Russian trolls are promoting Bernie
sanders or a Russian trolls are

2821
02:03:12,311 --> 02:03:15,250
promoting Jill Stein.
When you look at the actual methodology

2822
02:03:15,251 --> 02:03:18,700
of how they determine who's a Russian
Bot and who's a Russian troll,

2823
02:03:18,701 --> 02:03:23,701
it all comes from this think tank run by
literally Iraq war propagandists Bill

2824
02:03:23,860 --> 02:03:25,810
Crystal and Michael Chertoff.
So that's what I'm saying.

2825
02:03:25,840 --> 02:03:29,860
These narratives are so,
it's so obscure to find out who's really

2826
02:03:29,861 --> 02:03:32,380
managing the narratives,
but it really is all the same people

2827
02:03:32,590 --> 02:03:34,240
selling where they're corniness.
Again,

2828
02:03:34,980 --> 02:03:35,813
they're canniness

2829
02:03:36,490 --> 02:03:40,630
because we want the end goal of the
empire is basically Russia,

2830
02:03:40,690 --> 02:03:41,830
China,
Iran,

2831
02:03:42,100 --> 02:03:44,620
Iran and Syria.
The steppingstones basically ultimately

2832
02:03:44,621 --> 02:03:47,920
to China and Russia and um,
those are the biggest competitors with,

2833
02:03:47,980 --> 02:03:50,980
with the empire.
And so they want to just foment that hot

2834
02:03:50,981 --> 02:03:51,814
war with Russia.

2835
02:03:52,400 --> 02:03:53,820
You know what,
I've been going down a rabbit hole with

2836
02:03:55,130 --> 02:04:00,130
Chinese electronics.
Weiwei got banned from 18 and t and

2837
02:04:02,211 --> 02:04:07,211
verizon and all these other walway is
the number three phone manufacturer in

2838
02:04:08,601 --> 02:04:10,700
the world.
And they also manufacture network

2839
02:04:10,701 --> 02:04:13,220
equipment.
And there's some,

2840
02:04:13,221 --> 02:04:16,760
so it seems to me like,
and this is my conspiratorial mind and

2841
02:04:17,120 --> 02:04:20,750
I'm just going to say right away,
I'm a moron and I know very little about

2842
02:04:20,751 --> 02:04:22,550
this,
but this is what,

2843
02:04:22,820 --> 02:04:27,820
this is what's fascinating.
The Huawei makes some really good cell

2844
02:04:28,071 --> 02:04:32,390
phones,
like beautiful 40 megapixel camera,

2845
02:04:32,420 --> 02:04:34,700
excellent design,
gorgeous screen.

2846
02:04:34,880 --> 02:04:39,880
And they were about to be launched
America under a t and t and then the

2847
02:04:41,520 --> 02:04:45,720
State Department warned against people
buying walway phones,

2848
02:04:45,721 --> 02:04:50,190
sitting their spy devices and told
people to not buy walway phones.

2849
02:04:50,520 --> 02:04:55,200
So weird.
Then they're bringing up charges against

2850
02:04:55,201 --> 02:04:58,470
wowway for something to do with Iran.
So,

2851
02:04:58,471 --> 02:05:01,140
and then there was an article today,
this is where it gets really weird,

2852
02:05:01,141 --> 02:05:02,400
the compliance of the media.

2853
02:05:02,400 --> 02:05:06,960
There was an article today about this,
the drop in sales of Chinese cell

2854
02:05:06,961 --> 02:05:09,750
phones.
It's Chinese cell phone sales plummet by

2855
02:05:09,751 --> 02:05:12,510
21% I was reading today.
Um,

2856
02:05:12,570 --> 02:05:14,490
but what,
like what is happening here?

2857
02:05:14,550 --> 02:05:19,140
Like they were saying that there was
some networking equipment that was made

2858
02:05:19,141 --> 02:05:24,141
by waterway that was sending,
was sending a certain amount of data

2859
02:05:25,561 --> 02:05:30,561
that didn't seem right and they believe
that some something was encoded in their

2860
02:05:30,661 --> 02:05:35,280
software and their hardware that allowed
them to hack into it and extract data

2861
02:05:35,281 --> 02:05:39,900
and use this as a spying device.
So then they were saying that this is

2862
02:05:39,901 --> 02:05:43,350
the case with the phones and these,
we shouldn't buy these wowway phones.

2863
02:05:43,710 --> 02:05:47,190
But then the android people,
I sent Jamie a couple articles on it

2864
02:05:47,191 --> 02:05:49,770
because I was fascinated by this.
I really like 30 articles about it.

2865
02:05:49,771 --> 02:05:51,480
I'm like in like the last week and a
half,

2866
02:05:52,170 --> 02:05:55,410
and these real smart tech people were
like,

2867
02:05:55,411 --> 02:05:56,244
this is horseshit.

2868
02:05:56,340 --> 02:05:59,910
First of all,
if these devices did have something in

2869
02:05:59,911 --> 02:06:04,260
them other than stock android or android
with a whatever they're a operating

2870
02:06:04,261 --> 02:06:06,660
system is that they put on over it like
their skin,

2871
02:06:06,880 --> 02:06:08,940
you would see it.
These guys would be able to see it.

2872
02:06:08,941 --> 02:06:10,020
They'd be able to find it.
This isn't,

2873
02:06:10,021 --> 02:06:12,090
they're not any more sophisticated.
These people,

2874
02:06:12,720 --> 02:06:14,340
well,
there's just something going on.

2875
02:06:14,370 --> 02:06:16,230
There's something going on.
There's some weirdness to it all.

2876
02:06:16,380 --> 02:06:18,930
It's like they might be trying to tank
these companies.

2877
02:06:18,990 --> 02:06:21,570
They might be like,
there might be a concerted effort,

2878
02:06:21,690 --> 02:06:25,770
and then the thought was that maybe
perhaps there's some sort of a deal with

2879
02:06:25,771 --> 02:06:30,771
Samsung and iphones,
which are the two top manufacturers to

2880
02:06:31,201 --> 02:06:35,160
keep out this third party,
which makes these really high end cell

2881
02:06:35,161 --> 02:06:39,750
phones like this.
The wowway has this porsche design mate

2882
02:06:39,780 --> 02:06:43,140
pro,
our s it's $2,000 it's like the most

2883
02:06:43,141 --> 02:06:44,550
expensive cell phone you could buy.

2884
02:06:44,750 --> 02:06:46,290
This thing is off the charts.
Awesome.

2885
02:06:46,530 --> 02:06:50,370
I mean it takes like nighttime a photo.
It turns it into like almost daylight,

2886
02:06:50,570 --> 02:06:53,490
like crazy 40 megapixel,
like

2887
02:06:55,080 --> 02:06:58,170
adjustable aperture,
like like as good as it gets in terms of

2888
02:06:58,171 --> 02:07:00,120
like modern day cell phones.
They're saying,

2889
02:07:00,121 --> 02:07:01,140
don't buy it,
don't buy it.

2890
02:07:01,141 --> 02:07:03,540
It's a spy device.
The tech guys are going,

2891
02:07:03,541 --> 02:07:05,430
you're out of your fucking mind.
You're like,

2892
02:07:05,460 --> 02:07:08,220
if she shouldn't buy it because they
don't update them very well.

2893
02:07:09,230 --> 02:07:10,560
By devices,
I mean,

2894
02:07:11,560 --> 02:07:12,300
yeah,
I'm sure.

2895
02:07:12,300 --> 02:07:13,133
I mean,
okay.

2896
02:07:13,270 --> 02:07:15,360
I,
I talk about something and I don't type

2897
02:07:15,361 --> 02:07:16,440
it in.
I don't write a message.

2898
02:07:16,441 --> 02:07:18,000
I don't write an email and I'll see an
ad,

2899
02:07:18,030 --> 02:07:20,490
so it's fine on us all the time.
That doesn't happen to you.

2900
02:07:20,880 --> 02:07:22,020
I,
it hasn't happened to me,

2901
02:07:22,021 --> 02:07:24,000
but it's happened to enough people that
I believe you.

2902
02:07:24,030 --> 02:07:24,863
It's insane.
Well,

2903
02:07:24,870 --> 02:07:26,130
I believe you know what?
No matter what,

2904
02:07:26,131 --> 02:07:28,440
but really crazy.
I've talked to so many people that have

2905
02:07:28,441 --> 02:07:32,010
had that happen.
Somebody sent me a tweet yesterday that

2906
02:07:32,011 --> 02:07:35,560
said they were listening to a podcast
that were doing,

2907
02:07:35,561 --> 02:07:36,220
we were talking

2908
02:07:36,220 --> 02:07:39,870
about something and then that's
something appeared in their Google ads

2909
02:07:40,480 --> 02:07:42,010
and he's like,
I never looked up this.

2910
02:07:42,011 --> 02:07:42,880
I never,
and oh no.

2911
02:07:42,881 --> 02:07:45,130
It wasn't a google ad.
It was a youtube search.

2912
02:07:45,131 --> 02:07:47,810
It was a youtube suggested.
He's like my fucking computers

2913
02:07:47,840 --> 02:07:48,850
listening.
Yup.

2914
02:07:49,210 --> 02:07:51,040
Pewter.
And what APP is doing this?

2915
02:07:51,041 --> 02:07:52,690
I mean,
I'm about to just go to a flip phone

2916
02:07:52,691 --> 02:07:53,900
because I don't want to,
it's,

2917
02:07:53,910 --> 02:07:56,560
it's bullshit.
We know that youtube audio is being

2918
02:07:56,561 --> 02:07:59,980
listened to because they're mining it to
for ad ad stuff already.

2919
02:08:00,100 --> 02:08:02,830
It's not even,
it's not a spy thing that's just out

2920
02:08:02,831 --> 02:08:03,910
there.
That's how they do it.

2921
02:08:03,970 --> 02:08:06,970
Right.
But is that if you're playing things?

2922
02:08:07,060 --> 02:08:08,890
Yeah,
so when we're playing,

2923
02:08:08,950 --> 02:08:12,460
so if he's playing a podcast on Youtube,
youtube listening to that and that's how

2924
02:08:12,461 --> 02:08:14,500
they suggest it's just happening in
their ads.

2925
02:08:14,520 --> 02:08:18,580
What I think might be happening with
people are noticing now is not just that

2926
02:08:18,700 --> 02:08:22,030
it's happening within the software.
It's that your actual device,

2927
02:08:22,060 --> 02:08:25,300
the microphone is on and the Laptop
camera is on.

2928
02:08:25,301 --> 02:08:28,750
So people block the camera with tape.
They're not blocking the microphone.

2929
02:08:28,751 --> 02:08:29,291
Yeah,
exactly.

2930
02:08:29,291 --> 02:08:30,580
How the hell do you block the
microphone?

2931
02:08:30,620 --> 02:08:31,510
Don't even know where it is.

2932
02:08:31,780 --> 02:08:33,460
How do I,
how can we have like some sort of

2933
02:08:33,461 --> 02:08:37,540
tutorial about like how are we can
prevent all of our shit from being

2934
02:08:37,541 --> 02:08:38,710
collected?
Like that whole,

2935
02:08:38,890 --> 02:08:40,750
the facebook,
Cambridge analytica thing.

2936
02:08:41,110 --> 02:08:43,690
I feel like everyone missed the boat of
what that story was.

2937
02:08:43,691 --> 02:08:44,390
You heard about that,
right?

2938
02:08:44,390 --> 02:08:46,420
The Cambridge Analytica,
they're data mining all your shit.

2939
02:08:46,421 --> 02:08:46,930
It's like,
yeah,

2940
02:08:46,930 --> 02:08:49,210
if you're on facebook,
everything's being taken in data mind.

2941
02:08:49,211 --> 02:08:52,390
That's very obvious.
But what wasn't really investigated,

2942
02:08:52,391 --> 02:08:55,810
I think channel four did this crazy
investigation where they pretended like

2943
02:08:55,811 --> 02:08:59,020
they were a patron trying to hire
Cambridge Analytica,

2944
02:08:59,030 --> 02:09:02,230
some billionaire dude,
and they put them on camera.

2945
02:09:02,231 --> 02:09:04,600
It's all recorded.
The guys are basically like,

2946
02:09:05,020 --> 02:09:07,810
it's basically like a private
intelligence from almost like a black

2947
02:09:07,811 --> 02:09:11,140
water where you going to hire
mercenaries to set up honeypots with

2948
02:09:11,141 --> 02:09:13,000
prostitutes,
take down politicians,

2949
02:09:13,360 --> 02:09:16,330
spy on them.
They set up shell companies with mis six

2950
02:09:16,910 --> 02:09:18,390
massaad.
Um,

2951
02:09:18,580 --> 02:09:21,310
it's all just untraceable shit.
They just go sit out.

2952
02:09:21,311 --> 02:09:23,140
They said they can ghost in out of
countries.

2953
02:09:23,410 --> 02:09:26,140
They literally said that they staged the
entire Kenyan election.

2954
02:09:26,141 --> 02:09:27,340
They were like,
we staged the whole thing.

2955
02:09:27,341 --> 02:09:29,500
We wrote all the speeches.
Yeah.

2956
02:09:29,670 --> 02:09:31,180
Can this gentleman,
this is,

2957
02:09:31,181 --> 02:09:33,280
this is backed by a billionaire,
Robert Mercer,

2958
02:09:33,281 --> 02:09:36,820
the same guy who come behind us.
Channel Four did a crazy investigation

2959
02:09:36,821 --> 02:09:38,530
about it and the,
and so that's why I'm just like,

2960
02:09:38,531 --> 02:09:40,080
why is everyone focusing on facebook

2961
02:09:40,110 --> 02:09:41,790
data?
This is like a crazy,

2962
02:09:43,640 --> 02:09:48,000
that's stupid game that people play was
it is called for farmland Farmville or

2963
02:09:48,001 --> 02:09:50,190
something world farm.
Fuck yeah.

2964
02:09:50,580 --> 02:09:51,790
What is that shit?
Farmville.

2965
02:09:52,590 --> 02:09:53,420
Farmville.
Yeah.

2966
02:09:53,420 --> 02:09:54,660
That,
that's what people were talking about.

2967
02:09:54,661 --> 02:09:56,940
Oh,
you're going to have data about the cows

2968
02:09:56,941 --> 02:10:00,300
I buy here.
Like changing the government or they're

2969
02:10:00,301 --> 02:10:03,960
killing people and like the band and
Knights and the Breitbart people are,

2970
02:10:04,380 --> 02:10:05,040
how many other colors

2971
02:10:05,040 --> 02:10:06,330
please are there like this?
I always think,

2972
02:10:06,360 --> 02:10:07,950
yeah.
Well we're all focused on Russian

2973
02:10:07,951 --> 02:10:10,260
trolls.
14 Russian trolls in St Petersburg.

2974
02:10:10,530 --> 02:10:13,350
How many companies like Cambridge
Analytica,

2975
02:10:13,351 --> 02:10:15,600
like blackwater?
Like all these things are operating

2976
02:10:15,601 --> 02:10:18,170
around the world doing all this gotta be
a fuck load a lot.

2977
02:10:18,171 --> 02:10:18,270
Yeah.

2978
02:10:18,270 --> 02:10:20,400
There's gotta be a lot that we don't
know of because it's only when,

2979
02:10:20,401 --> 02:10:23,000
when something fucks up or someone gets
shot in the head and like,

2980
02:10:23,360 --> 02:10:24,110
yeah.
Was He wearing?

2981
02:10:24,110 --> 02:10:24,701
Yeah.
And they're like,

2982
02:10:24,701 --> 02:10:26,080
Whoa,
what is that?

2983
02:10:26,440 --> 02:10:27,580
Oh,
change the Kenyan elections.

2984
02:10:27,581 --> 02:10:28,870
Cool.
Like in cell,

2985
02:10:28,871 --> 02:10:31,120
we never heard of a sudden people are
talking about it.

2986
02:10:31,520 --> 02:10:34,040
There's got to be so many of those
things that are just bubbling up in the

2987
02:10:34,040 --> 02:10:36,390
distance.
Disturbing.

2988
02:10:36,930 --> 02:10:37,611
Well,
you said,

2989
02:10:37,611 --> 02:10:40,520
how do I deal?
You got to do art and you got to go on

2990
02:10:40,521 --> 02:10:42,500
hikes and go explore nature.
Yeah.

2991
02:10:42,550 --> 02:10:44,270
But you are,
do you ever want to like knock,

2992
02:10:44,271 --> 02:10:46,100
concentrate?
Do you ever feel like it's not gonna do

2993
02:10:46,101 --> 02:10:47,600
any good like,
this is,

2994
02:10:47,780 --> 02:10:50,420
this is my,
my question that I give to everybody

2995
02:10:50,421 --> 02:10:54,380
who's like an activist who's very
adamant about change and doing

2996
02:10:54,381 --> 02:10:57,080
something.
Do you ever feel like you just don't

2997
02:10:57,081 --> 02:10:59,000
want to participate anymore and just
want to just,

2998
02:10:59,970 --> 02:11:02,190
just,
someone asked me the other day,

2999
02:11:02,191 --> 02:11:02,671
they said,
you know,

3000
02:11:02,671 --> 02:11:06,210
you have to admit that you wouldn't
rather live anywhere in the world other

3001
02:11:06,211 --> 02:11:07,050
than here.
And I said,

3002
02:11:07,090 --> 02:11:07,923
I,
I,

3003
02:11:07,970 --> 02:11:11,010
I would because I can't have a kid here
because I don't have maternity leave and

3004
02:11:11,011 --> 02:11:11,910
I don't have any help.
I was like,

3005
02:11:11,911 --> 02:11:12,541
so,
no,

3006
02:11:12,541 --> 02:11:15,000
I,
I stay here because I have to and I have

3007
02:11:15,001 --> 02:11:17,490
to fight.
It's not about me and it's not about

3008
02:11:17,491 --> 02:11:19,740
myself.
It's about the greater good.

3009
02:11:20,250 --> 02:11:22,800
And it's about putting this information
out there because,

3010
02:11:22,801 --> 02:11:27,270
especially in the trump era,
I feel like no one is really criticizing

3011
02:11:27,271 --> 02:11:30,420
him in the correct way and putting it in
the proper context of the u s empire.

3012
02:11:30,421 --> 02:11:32,220
And I feel like I need to do that.
And,

3013
02:11:32,670 --> 02:11:33,720
um,
I,

3014
02:11:34,620 --> 02:11:36,660
I don't get sick of it and I don't think
that,

3015
02:11:36,661 --> 02:11:38,460
you know,
even if you do get burnt out and you get

3016
02:11:38,461 --> 02:11:40,050
tired,
you just have to keep going because this

3017
02:11:40,051 --> 02:11:41,190
is,
you don't have to,

3018
02:11:41,191 --> 02:11:44,280
you don't do it for recognition.
You don't do it to be on a magazine

3019
02:11:44,281 --> 02:11:47,070
cover because you're never going to be
rewarded in the system that we live in,

3020
02:11:47,500 --> 02:11:50,370
that we're going to always live on the
margins and we're going to always fight

3021
02:11:50,371 --> 02:11:51,930
on the margins.
Um,

3022
02:11:51,931 --> 02:11:52,860
and that's just the way it is.

3023
02:11:53,060 --> 02:11:56,610
Do you hope to somebody who's listening
so that alters their perception and then

3024
02:11:56,611 --> 02:11:57,780
somehow or another it spreads.

3025
02:11:58,040 --> 02:11:59,930
Yeah,
I think history is instructive and I

3026
02:11:59,931 --> 02:12:01,640
think that's why,
that's why I do what I do.

3027
02:12:01,641 --> 02:12:05,480
I want to instruct people about how
history has shaped our reality today and

3028
02:12:05,481 --> 02:12:10,190
how we can use it to learn and prevent
similar atrocities from continuing.

3029
02:12:10,191 --> 02:12:12,710
I mean,
I just hope that we can evolve to the

3030
02:12:12,711 --> 02:12:13,850
point where we can do that.

3031
02:12:14,590 --> 02:12:16,330
You essentially work for yourself now,
right?

3032
02:12:16,740 --> 02:12:19,410
I worked for Telesur tell a store is a,
um,

3033
02:12:19,680 --> 02:12:23,820
also state media six Latin American
countries and including Venezuela and

3034
02:12:23,821 --> 02:12:26,100
including Cuba,
Ecuador,

3035
02:12:26,730 --> 02:12:27,291
um,
and,

3036
02:12:27,291 --> 02:12:29,310
and some other countries fun tell a
sore,

3037
02:12:29,610 --> 02:12:32,850
but because of the sanctions that trump
has put on a Venezuela,

3038
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:35,280
it's,
it's on a tedious leg.

3039
02:12:35,880 --> 02:12:38,340
So um,
it sucks that the only other place that

3040
02:12:38,341 --> 02:12:40,750
you can go is really just begging you
for donations on Patrion.

3041
02:12:40,840 --> 02:12:44,260
But as the empire files that is it
through Telstra?

3042
02:12:44,470 --> 02:12:45,011
We,
yeah,

3043
02:12:45,011 --> 02:12:47,590
so we are pro,
I have a production company and I

3044
02:12:47,620 --> 02:12:49,300
produced the show and then I sell it to
them.

3045
02:12:49,580 --> 02:12:53,780
But you say begging for donations.
I really don't see it that way because

3046
02:12:53,781 --> 02:12:57,080
if you just give people the option,
I bet people would be more than willing

3047
02:12:57,081 --> 02:12:59,900
to support your,
your work if they're interested in your

3048
02:12:59,901 --> 02:13:03,050
work.
And it seems like there's so many people

3049
02:13:03,051 --> 02:13:07,970
out there that would be now and it'd be
a great way to be completely independent

3050
02:13:07,971 --> 02:13:11,540
and not beholden to any state run group
or anything else.

3051
02:13:11,541 --> 02:13:15,080
You just basically be putting out
content and people didn't like it

3052
02:13:15,081 --> 02:13:16,490
anymore.
They wouldn't pay for it anymore.

3053
02:13:16,820 --> 02:13:17,421
Yeah,
no,

3054
02:13:17,421 --> 02:13:18,440
I think that,
well,

3055
02:13:18,441 --> 02:13:20,900
I'm not beholding to anyone because I
don't really have anyone telling me what

3056
02:13:20,901 --> 02:13:21,830
to do.
Like in Venezuela,

3057
02:13:21,831 --> 02:13:25,070
I was interviewing the defense minister,
no one vetted my questions.

3058
02:13:25,071 --> 02:13:27,770
I was confronting him about all this
crazy shit.

3059
02:13:27,771 --> 02:13:29,360
I mean,
no one in corporate media would be

3060
02:13:29,361 --> 02:13:31,710
allowed to do that with our government.
But yeah,

3061
02:13:31,711 --> 02:13:33,600
to your point,
I think that we've just gotten to a

3062
02:13:33,601 --> 02:13:36,530
place with journalism and media where,
um,

3063
02:13:36,630 --> 02:13:39,210
that's the way it is.
Like you have to invest in the

3064
02:13:39,211 --> 02:13:43,020
journalists that you want to support and
that's just the way that the world

3065
02:13:43,021 --> 02:13:45,180
works.
Because media is not a sustainable

3066
02:13:45,450 --> 02:13:48,060
business if you want it to be holding
power to account.

3067
02:13:48,320 --> 02:13:52,660
But it seems like that's not the worst
thing in the world to have something

3068
02:13:52,661 --> 02:13:57,661
like Patrion or some similar type of a
situation where people can just donate.

3069
02:13:58,070 --> 02:13:59,810
And I have that on media roots.
Um,

3070
02:13:59,840 --> 02:14:01,430
and on my podcast,
media roots radio,

3071
02:14:01,431 --> 02:14:02,960
I do have a Patriot in there.
But yeah,

3072
02:14:02,961 --> 02:14:03,980
you're right.
I mean to do it.

3073
02:14:04,010 --> 02:14:07,370
But to do investigative journalism,
it's hard one to do documentaries.

3074
02:14:07,371 --> 02:14:09,800
It takes a lot of money and time.
And um,

3075
02:14:09,890 --> 02:14:13,640
I think that's probably where it'll end
up if we keep going down the road that

3076
02:14:13,641 --> 02:14:14,600
we are,
which is,

3077
02:14:15,380 --> 02:14:17,370
you know,
whether it be our to your teleseminar,

3078
02:14:17,390 --> 02:14:20,090
this,
this a fear campaign against state media

3079
02:14:20,091 --> 02:14:22,730
and against the Russian propaganda.
Yeah.

3080
02:14:23,300 --> 02:14:24,170
And um,
yeah,

3081
02:14:24,171 --> 02:14:26,960
it's tough.
So we'll just keep trying to f uh,

3082
02:14:27,920 --> 02:14:29,970
speak that truth.
Yeah.

3083
02:14:30,850 --> 02:14:34,750
Well I'm glad you're out there swinging.
You know,

3084
02:14:34,751 --> 02:14:37,630
it's,
it's a scary job and punching up.

3085
02:14:37,660 --> 02:14:40,810
You go to crazy places too.
I mean you're not,

3086
02:14:41,260 --> 02:14:43,270
you're not swinging from the comfort of
your own home.

3087
02:14:43,271 --> 02:14:44,980
You're,
you're out there in the war zone.

3088
02:14:45,620 --> 02:14:49,490
It was scary when I confronted soldiers
in Columbia because I realized that I

3089
02:14:49,491 --> 02:14:52,760
could probably die either by hazing or a
mine.

3090
02:14:53,030 --> 02:14:54,800
Like,
cause there's mines all over the fucking

3091
02:14:54,801 --> 02:14:57,950
place and they were just like,
you need to leave right now if you want

3092
02:14:57,951 --> 02:14:58,440
to live

3093
02:14:58,440 --> 02:14:59,400
basically.
And I was like,

3094
02:14:59,440 --> 02:15:01,110
okay,
well see you later.

3095
02:15:02,100 --> 02:15:05,550
See you later guys.
That's why I asked if ever does seems

3096
02:15:05,551 --> 02:15:07,190
like,
how long do you,

3097
02:15:07,230 --> 02:15:09,810
do you see yourself doing this until
you're an old lady?

3098
02:15:09,870 --> 02:15:12,840
You know,
I think that if I have a family things I

3099
02:15:12,841 --> 02:15:14,250
might put,
you know,

3100
02:15:14,580 --> 02:15:19,580
I will knock you out.
It's the governor's going to hook your

3101
02:15:19,890 --> 02:15:22,770
boyfriend.
How do you pot?

3102
02:15:22,950 --> 02:15:25,000
They're going to give them a cup of
coffee from strange man.

3103
02:15:25,810 --> 02:15:28,990
Shut the fuck up and drink.
And if you want a family getting a

3104
02:15:28,991 --> 02:15:30,120
whole,
um,

3105
02:15:30,310 --> 02:15:31,690
no,
I think that if I have a family,

3106
02:15:31,691 --> 02:15:31,810
yeah,

3107
02:15:31,810 --> 02:15:35,530
things might change where I might not
put my life on the line.

3108
02:15:35,531 --> 02:15:37,510
So often we are,
I would imagine so.

3109
02:15:37,690 --> 02:15:38,441
But um,
yeah,

3110
02:15:38,441 --> 02:15:41,410
I mean I have to,
someone's got to keep poking holes in

3111
02:15:41,411 --> 02:15:45,100
this bullshit because it just keeps
happening and we keep getting duped and

3112
02:15:45,101 --> 02:15:48,160
someone has to be out there countering
the narrative and telling these stories

3113
02:15:48,161 --> 02:15:52,570
from marginalized and oppressed people
who have not been given those platforms.

3114
02:15:52,571 --> 02:15:53,830
And I have to keep doing that part.

3115
02:15:54,090 --> 02:15:56,460
Well,
I would suggest you stay offline for a

3116
02:15:56,460 --> 02:15:59,310
couple of weeks after this one just to
avoid the shit storm.

3117
02:15:59,700 --> 02:16:01,170
And a,
it's always great seeing you.

3118
