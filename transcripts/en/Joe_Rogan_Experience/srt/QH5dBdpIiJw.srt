4
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:15,840
Used to be a long time ago that it was
a real pain in the ass to get a website.

5
00:00:15,841 --> 00:00:18,600
If you want to get a website, you have
to find someone who knew how to make one.

6
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:20,370
They had a code in html,

7
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,990
it was a nightmare and then they started
making these programs like Dreamweaver

8
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:28,830
and all these very difficult to learn
and try to figure out how to put it

9
00:00:28,831 --> 00:00:32,040
together and then if it worked it
wouldn't work on certain platforms.

10
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,270

00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:13,920
it was an honor for me to hang out with
you that night. It was really cool for a,

85
00:05:13,921 --> 00:05:16,990
we had dinner with your family and
then we watch some fights. Yeah.

86
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,830
And it was really interesting watching
fights with you and watching you

87
00:05:19,831 --> 00:05:23,250
breakdown positions and breakdown
the mistakes that people were making.

88
00:05:23,251 --> 00:05:24,930
And I've told a lot of people about that,

89
00:05:24,931 --> 00:05:29,670
I'm throwing a lot of people about
that night. That documentary a choke.

90
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:32,040
Uh, that is one document
that I've told people,

91
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:35,430
if you really interested in Jujitsu, you
really want to find out, you know what,

92
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,350

00:05:37,351 --> 00:05:41,820
Watch the documentary choke that
documentary. So inspirational.

94
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,060
They followed you, was it in 94? 95?

95
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,910
Yeah. 95. [inaudible] 96

96
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,730
[inaudible] 95 going [inaudible]
96 and you were fighting in Japan,

97
00:05:49,731 --> 00:05:53,120
in the Japan valley to doe and it
documented a lot of your training and

98
00:05:53,121 --> 00:05:57,020
documented your philosophy and man,
whenever I, if I ever need some,

99
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,160
I'll slap

100
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,170
that DVD on.
He just get fired up.

101
00:06:00,171 --> 00:06:03,320
You wanted to go see and do some yoga
on the beach or something? Yeah, no,

102
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:07,720
it's fine. How did that come about?
What? That documentary, Oh, was it

103
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:12,900
project we fight student of mine who
was working with the polygraph and also,

104
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,550
uh, cop. So he decided,

105
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:20,430
we decided to follow up to
the event. And so we, we,

106
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:25,740
they have a crew following
couple of fighters and a and uh,

107
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:30,670
follow myself to see what's going
to happen at the event. So it was a,

108
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,410
a nice,
uh,

109
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:36,280
introduction to a preparation
to the mindset of a fighter,

110
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,970
either myself or the Todd Haynes.
What's another,

111
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:44,320
and also the Japanese guy who was
also involved from the filming.

112
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:49,380
So it was a cool Brian will
experience tool to an MMA fight.

113
00:06:50,231 --> 00:06:51,250
Like I've only to the fight.

114
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:51,761
Well,

115
00:06:51,761 --> 00:06:56,560
it's very eye opening for a lot of
fighters who looked at mixed martial arts.

116
00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:00,310
A lot of them come from a
wrestling background and
they looked at mixed martial

117
00:07:00,311 --> 00:07:04,090
arts, more of like as a sport just
beat tough, you know, you gotta get up,

118
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:05,860
you've got to train hard,
you got to run hard,

119
00:07:05,861 --> 00:07:09,670
you gotta live hard and your philosophy
was much more like a Samurai.

120
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:14,560
Your philosophy was much deeper,
much more meditation base.

121
00:07:14,561 --> 00:07:17,140
And we got to see you
doing yoga. You, you,

122
00:07:17,141 --> 00:07:22,120
I think you opened up a lot of people's
eyes to a different mindset involved in

123
00:07:22,121 --> 00:07:24,610
preparation,
but also to yoga.

124
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:28,780
That was the first time I'd ever seen a
martial artist that was really into yoga.

125
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:32,670
Yes. I think, uh, for
the athlete in general,

126
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:37,810
the breathing and the understanding of
the breathing is a big plus because he

127
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:39,020
stretch or your,

128
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:44,010
I mean by hyperventilate you stretch
or physical potential by know how to

129
00:07:44,011 --> 00:07:45,780
breathe properly.
You relax,

130
00:07:45,781 --> 00:07:49,140
you can bring your heart beats.

131
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:53,220
Lower is a lot of elements in
the breathing who are involved.

132
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:57,480
We've controlling emotions,
getting more energy and so on.

133
00:07:57,481 --> 00:08:01,560
So as I get exposed to
Brett to breathing properly,

134
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:06,850
I get addicted and I felt like was
a huge, uh, element of, you know,

135
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:09,960
too. In addition to the techniques,
in addition to the heart,

136
00:08:09,961 --> 00:08:13,340
into the heart training,
learning the breathing is,

137
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:16,800
is a huge beneficial
thing for the athlete.

138
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:20,490
Now you see athletes,
like tennis players, they,

139
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:25,490
Oh hey, they play in breathing and the
breathing, the breath is much more,

140
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,080
do they support you?
They,

141
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:32,150
so it's a process of knowing
now I see grown, my son, he's,

142
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:36,500
I'm in before. He's just like, see all
that. I see you training and Brita.

143
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:40,070
But now he's coming to me and said that
this make all the difference in the ward

144
00:08:40,071 --> 00:08:41,680
when I really, you know, start,

145
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:44,200
you're getting tired to make
hyperventilation and keep my,

146
00:08:44,201 --> 00:08:49,060
in my mind like sharp because
sometimes you should get tired. Uh,

147
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,480
the is not enough oxygen
in the blood to fuel your,

148
00:08:53,481 --> 00:08:57,360
your sharpness in your mind. So
you become a little, uh, stupid,

149
00:08:57,361 --> 00:09:00,690
a little slower, you
know? So by having a good,

150
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:05,940
knowing how to hyperventilate,
you able to, to maximize this,

151
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:09,810
this oxygen you. So even though the
acid electric take over your body,

152
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:12,690
your mind is too sharp and you're
still responding accordingly.

153
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,830
So it's a great thing to do. And you were
born into the greatest Jujitsu family,

154
00:09:16,831 --> 00:09:20,370
the greatest martial arts family of all
time. I mean, there's no doubt about it.

155
00:09:20,371 --> 00:09:22,260
There's no,
there's not even a second place.

156
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,470
There's the Gracie family and then
there's, you know, there's the,

157
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:27,600
I guess you could have a debate
about who comes in second,

158
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:31,320
but it's kind of ridiculous that that
is the number one martial arts family of

159
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:36,060
all time. And you obviously learn
Jujitsu from a very early age,

160
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,990
but how did you get involved into
the yoga? Always, you know, uh,

161
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,110
was,
I'm very happy to,

162
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:46,950
to be related with this
master call learned to Connie,

163
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:51,060
which was the precursor
of the [inaudible].

164
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:56,470
I was learning at the same time over
the homeowner who is the guy who is now

165
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:02,490
making the tapes we learning together,
you know. And um, at that point,

166
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:07,740
um, it was just practic scene
with him. Like he loaned my,

167
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:12,600
my father, he's a older guy who's a very
tough athlete and also a yoga teacher.

168
00:10:12,601 --> 00:10:17,220
So he combined,
he developed some kind of style of yoga,

169
00:10:17,221 --> 00:10:22,221
which is not exactly a postural black
postures and breathing to relax or to

170
00:10:22,981 --> 00:10:27,560
achieve meditation was more like a,
an active breeding for athletes. And,

171
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:30,480
and are there for you to jump higher.
You have to know how to,

172
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:34,050
to have arm when you, between
your, your jump in your breathing.

173
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:37,350
You want to keep Marty
strength for more long time.

174
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,980
You have to know how to breed a
quarterly chew to promote that.

175
00:10:40,981 --> 00:10:42,570
So he has always,

176
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:47,780
he always in the active active
breathing and then we kind of,

177
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,570
we started doing privates and I
was in his place for, you know,

178
00:10:51,571 --> 00:10:54,600
for a couple of months,
his guiding me through the,

179
00:10:54,601 --> 00:10:59,340
the moves in front of a
mirror in a nice room one day.

180
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,390
Um,

181
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:05,370
we about to start the class
and sooner he's about to start.

182
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:10,050
Uh, he, he was calling the
phone and he said to me,

183
00:11:10,051 --> 00:11:11,940
Hixon you keep going
and I'll be right back.

184
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:15,560
So for the first time I was able to breed,

185
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:20,280
make my routine without follow him up
without having my mind focus in what he

186
00:11:20,281 --> 00:11:24,690
was doing. So I start to breathe
and move and breathe and move,

187
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:29,670
and then has some woods on the walls,
kind of.

188
00:11:29,671 --> 00:11:33,150
We cannot imitate monkeys to
climb the wooed and stuff.

189
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:38,151
So in one point I come back to reality
and then I was on top of the highest

190
00:11:40,981 --> 00:11:44,190
frame in the wall sweating like a pig.

191
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:49,560
And then I look around and start to come
back to reality and I saw him on the

192
00:11:49,561 --> 00:11:54,010
corner crying and then I, what's up man?

193
00:11:54,011 --> 00:11:57,670
What's going on? He said, man, you don't
have to learn anything else from me.

194
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:02,240
You achieve the highest level of Gut,

195
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,680
get empty mine. And
then I kinda said, why?

196
00:12:05,681 --> 00:12:10,480
I say that said Yeah because you here for
an hour, 50 minutes in, completely off.

197
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:15,540
I mean you didn't notice anything because
he was applying did development of the

198
00:12:15,731 --> 00:12:18,880
animal instinct,
which takes your brain off,

199
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,850
you're in your mind,

200
00:12:20,851 --> 00:12:25,630
your your concentration and keep
you more like a instinctive anymore.

201
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:30,250
And that's was the vision in through this.

202
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:34,630
Because before that I was doing
transcendental meditation.

203
00:12:34,631 --> 00:12:39,631
I did traditional yoga and and those
never did great for me in the meditation.

204
00:12:39,761 --> 00:12:43,480
I was sleeping and it's not,
by doing that kind of routine,

205
00:12:43,481 --> 00:12:48,481
I W I was able to not just breathing
properly but also achieve empty mine.

206
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:54,790
And I was like in a state of meditation,
Meditation State,

207
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,870
uh, for a long time,
like not concentrating in
anything like rational, oh,

208
00:12:59,871 --> 00:13:04,780
he's there or he's, so I was able to
get a achieve like, uh, I empty mine.

209
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:09,510
And after I noticed that I start
to practice my routines to,

210
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:12,250
to get that same feeling of emptiness.

211
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:16,390
And that kind of meditation
works for me as no, no other one.

212
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:21,040
And I felt like being an
empty mine increases my,

213
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,740
my, I don't know, my, my intuition
increases my, my sense of,

214
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:32,160
of energy and so was incredible for
me because I could get in touch more

215
00:13:33,371 --> 00:13:37,210
comfortably with my, I
mean, my third vision,

216
00:13:37,211 --> 00:13:38,500
I don't know exactly explained,

217
00:13:38,501 --> 00:13:43,120
but I could achieve a completely
peace of mine in that kind of routine.

218
00:13:43,121 --> 00:13:45,100
So I was stick for life.

219
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:49,610
So you just got into this state and you
could just exist. No conscious thought,

220
00:13:49,611 --> 00:13:53,000
no thinking about anything around
you and no past, no future.

221
00:13:53,001 --> 00:13:56,990
Just exist is in our moment
as act with no context. Yes.

222
00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:02,210
That's a kind of a weird positive feeling
because you capable to be present in a

223
00:14:03,601 --> 00:14:07,050
sense which, uh, if
you have your mind set,

224
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:11,040
if you have something
expectations or you never there.

225
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:13,500
So I was able to,
to,

226
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:18,710
to be very confident very easily to get
into that situation where even prior to

227
00:14:18,961 --> 00:14:22,830
the fight I'm able to sleep on the,
on the locker room,

228
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:27,030
making my workout, getting
a high, very high heartbeat.

229
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:30,240
And then like five minutes
before I make my praise,

230
00:14:30,241 --> 00:14:35,241
I make my meditation and I kind of cool
off my heartbeat to 60 60 heartbeats a

231
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:40,980
minute. So I was able to engage
very hot and with the hard,

232
00:14:40,981 --> 00:14:45,270
very hard, low heartbeat.
And as the fight progress,

233
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:47,220
the pace is very hard.

234
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:52,130
If I'm 60 he is 80 when I'm,
he's a Honda Day.

235
00:14:52,131 --> 00:14:53,210
When I'm a Honda,

236
00:14:53,211 --> 00:14:58,211
he's 120 when I'm 120 he's a 45th so
when he started to re have to regroup,

237
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:02,630
I was still having to go forward.

238
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:07,280
So at that point my opponents
always lose a little B. He is bay.

239
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:10,670
So I ended up time for me to make
the, the, the kill, you know,

240
00:15:10,671 --> 00:15:13,280
so it was always working properly for me.

241
00:15:13,281 --> 00:15:16,010
They re the breathing was
always working very well.

242
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:19,160
So this empty mind state
enhanced your Jujitsu,

243
00:15:19,161 --> 00:15:23,090
this ability to achieve this state on
top of all the techniques on top of all

244
00:15:23,091 --> 00:15:26,450
the training and the instincts.
This took it to the next level? Yes,

245
00:15:26,451 --> 00:15:30,800
because you know in one point if
you allowed yourself to be present,

246
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:35,150
you're not commit to the office
or the defense, you commit,

247
00:15:35,151 --> 00:15:37,100
you give nothing and take everything.

248
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,810
So you give me opportunity that will
be there. If you try to be surprise me,

249
00:15:41,811 --> 00:15:44,420
I will be there a
quarterly defending myself.

250
00:15:44,421 --> 00:15:49,421
So he's all on the table is like no
surprises because he's no expectations.

251
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,770
So keeping a coal mine,

252
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:56,660
even when it's boiling is something I
felt like was always like a something

253
00:15:56,661 --> 00:16:01,661
which gives me an edge because I was there
just to either catch what is there or

254
00:16:03,411 --> 00:16:04,490
resolved the problem.

255
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:09,020
Never disappointed or never a late,

256
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:12,770
no expectation. Yeah. And
he's always late. I mean,

257
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:15,980
sometimes we get late because you plan
something in the fight and it doesn't

258
00:16:15,981 --> 00:16:18,920
happen. So we've well is you
start to be disappointed.

259
00:16:18,921 --> 00:16:22,790
So for me it was always like whatever
happened, I'm there, I'm happy,

260
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:27,710
comfortable finding comfortable finding
the sharpness to, to achieve success,

261
00:16:27,711 --> 00:16:32,090
you know? So letting great, you
grew up in this Jujitsu family,

262
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,650
but you were always,

263
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,730
at least from most
people's interpretation,

264
00:16:37,731 --> 00:16:41,180
you were always the best guy out
of the family. How did that happen?

265
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:45,260
How did you rise above all the rest? I
mean you grew up with a bunch of killers.

266
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:49,880
Yes, everybody's trainee hired. Everybody
was pushing through the maximum.

267
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,350
And um,

268
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:57,310
for one point I feel like I'm as
dedicated and for perfectionist,

269
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:59,390
I'm competitive in my heart,

270
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:03,310
but some elements I get
was more like a god.

271
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,040
A God gift is not exactly
something I choose.

272
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:11,870
So we training the same,
why my brother,

273
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:15,950
I can play with my blood brothers and
they cannot have a chance with me.

274
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:20,270
So that's kind of hard to explain.
It's not me trying to do this.

275
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:24,380
This just happened is my, is my
self being, trying to be my best,

276
00:17:24,381 --> 00:17:29,240
plus the emotional control,
the peace of mind. It was all,

277
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,290
you know, for example, my love, my,

278
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,490
my beloved brother Heuler,

279
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,350
he's a great fighter with sometimes
we get too emotional, you know,

280
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:44,000
and that's kind of times
makes him choose the home,

281
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:48,360
the wrong path. So
hoists he's a, you know,

282
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,520
great fighter,
but sometimes

283
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:53,550
he,
he get a little confused.

284
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:58,880
He's not having the sharp offensive
attitude or so sometimes something sleep,

285
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,530
um, you know, and so on.

286
00:18:04,531 --> 00:18:09,330
So I not exactly know why I'm,
I'm the one,

287
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:14,160
I just have to represent and be,
you know, happy to be the one.

288
00:18:14,161 --> 00:18:18,420
And I tell him, man, all
the opportunities, I have
to represent ideas already.

289
00:18:18,421 --> 00:18:23,400
So I feel like completely
comfortable in myself saying, okay,

290
00:18:23,401 --> 00:18:27,660
I have nothing to prove to myself.
I did all. And uh, you know,

291
00:18:27,661 --> 00:18:32,370
I'm very happy with the results.
So, Jujitsu for life, for life.

292
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:36,120
Your brother that's not on Jamie,

293
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:41,820
sorry. You're, uh,

294
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:45,100
you had a cousin holes,
Gracie.

295
00:18:45,101 --> 00:18:47,880
This legendary holds
Gracie who was actually,

296
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,570
halls is in the DNA. He's Mike. My cousin,

297
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,720
but he was leaving in my house,

298
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:58,830
CSI born because my uncle as he,
he's,

299
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:02,670
he divorced from his wife.
He hauls mother,

300
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,190
he give,

301
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:08,640
my father was just get
married so he give Hollis to,

302
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:12,600
to be care to my father and mother.
So he was like your brother.

303
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:17,640
So he's my older brother because hard and
come in just after and then Helson and

304
00:19:17,641 --> 00:19:21,420
then when I born like eight
30 or nine years later,

305
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,640
I was the little one living with
halls, harden and house and for, for,

306
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:30,120
you know, so he's, my brother is
no way to see him differently.

307
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:34,320
He was known as a guy who
went all over the world,

308
00:19:34,321 --> 00:19:35,730
studied sambo,

309
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:39,930
studied at some catch wrestling and the
wrestlers and he would bring that back,

310
00:19:39,931 --> 00:19:43,650
right? Yes. What would
you credit holes in,

311
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:48,330
in bringing leg locks into
Brazilian Jujitsu? Is he the one?

312
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:53,500
Yes, I'm in the leg locks.
He specifically, uh,

313
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,190
it was not something I,
I kind of get the,

314
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,750
the major information from
hose was funny one day.

315
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:05,520
Eric Paulson was a good
student and a very good friend.

316
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:10,920
He brought a tape for me
from Japan. We've, uh, we've,

317
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:12,180
uh,

318
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:17,240
short too short the wrestling and I
saw that the new locks in the short,

319
00:20:17,781 --> 00:20:21,900
the wrestle, you know, some guys fighting.
And I, I saw and I kind of interesting.

320
00:20:21,901 --> 00:20:25,490
And then next day I start
to apply it. And then, uh,

321
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:27,670
it was funny because he
come to me afterwards,

322
00:20:27,671 --> 00:20:31,260
said Hixon you mean I give
her that tape one day,

323
00:20:31,261 --> 00:20:34,950
next day we're so meeting everybody on
the knee locks. So, Oh really? Yeah,

324
00:20:34,951 --> 00:20:35,530
it was a,
you,

325
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:40,470
you would say you learn more leg locks
from Eric Paulson's tape then holes yet,

326
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:44,700
I mean halls, it was not specifically
I lead luck guy. You know,

327
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:48,310
there's a picture of him with a
Samba shirt on. Look, he studied,

328
00:20:48,311 --> 00:20:50,530
he was a master of sound boat cause we,

329
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:55,610
we go in assemble as we go and any other
we go in represent these use you'd sue

330
00:20:56,201 --> 00:20:59,950
against symbol, you know, and
um, independent American games.

331
00:20:59,951 --> 00:21:04,280
We went in San Diego, um, was like, uh,

332
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:08,530
a very interesting because it,
the fighters,

333
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:13,540
they don't expect so much submissions
and we start immediately because duff

334
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:16,870
rassler's stuff, judo players.
So we started to meet at the,

335
00:21:16,871 --> 00:21:20,830
bringing the fight to the gown ground
in goal, four foot locks in knee locks.

336
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:22,900
And immediately,

337
00:21:22,901 --> 00:21:27,370
I mean in the first qualification phase
they statute tapping a lot and then the

338
00:21:27,371 --> 00:21:32,371
referees statue becomes kind of a little
scap goes about that the statute become

339
00:21:32,471 --> 00:21:36,920
one. So one's halls grab them and
then the foot lock, especially in the,

340
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,100
in the final match in his way division,

341
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:43,180
he get the gun to foot lock and the we
did the referee stopped the fight and say,

342
00:21:43,181 --> 00:21:45,190
no,
you cannot get the food luck on the joint.

343
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:48,580
You have to get on like on the shin. And
then it's kind of confusing, you know,

344
00:21:48,581 --> 00:21:52,870
and, and cutting the, that's why
halls lost the finals in this event.

345
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:57,280
And um,
this is what in the 70s was a,

346
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:00,980
I think eighties 81 or 80.
So they just,

347
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:05,620
they were trying to cut him out by the
referees stature getting upset because

348
00:22:05,621 --> 00:22:07,030
like,
what's funny,

349
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:12,390
we suppose to come in with a team from
Brazil of 12 guys and we spell expecting

350
00:22:13,871 --> 00:22:17,950
like I support from the government and
then the governor at that very less,

351
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:23,620
very less moment didn't, didn't give
to us. So my father page was to come.

352
00:22:23,621 --> 00:22:27,130
So just me, Carlos, Gracie Jr and halls.

353
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:32,050
So we come in to compete in this event.
And how old were you at this time?

354
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:37,000
He must've been like 18 or something.
Yes. 19 something like that. And then,

355
00:22:37,001 --> 00:22:41,590
uh, we coming and I was in
the, like my way division,

356
00:22:41,591 --> 00:22:46,591
which is one above halls and halls was
below me and Carlos was on top of me.

357
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:52,380
So we kind of having one in each
division and as the competition progress,

358
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:53,900
the referees,
the statue,

359
00:22:53,901 --> 00:22:58,180
see those three guys from Brazil just
submitting everybody because in sambal

360
00:22:58,181 --> 00:23:02,620
chokes are not allowed. No headlocks no,
no collar chokes. He's only knee locks,

361
00:23:02,621 --> 00:23:05,170
foot locks or straight on bars.

362
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:07,840
CanNot even do the Americans
because it goes into,

363
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:12,850
so we just go in trying to do foot
locks because those are the easiest way.

364
00:23:12,851 --> 00:23:15,410
So we start to finish the guys
and they started to say, God,

365
00:23:15,411 --> 00:23:18,460
this guy's coming and do food.
And everybody me complain,

366
00:23:18,461 --> 00:23:21,130
I don't know if it's som both
though isn't sambal. Yeah,

367
00:23:21,131 --> 00:23:25,390
that's what they do is footlocker. It's
now now back then there wasn't fun. It's,

368
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:29,380
it's, it's so interesting how enema
that's changed now. It was legal.

369
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:34,570
What was not used especially in December
when in the American concepts Russia

370
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:38,200
maybe. Yeah. You know what American
Samba focused on what Muslim,

371
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:40,500
they had a more likened to control.
The rules are,

372
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:44,830
if you pin the guy for 30 seconds
is, was like wrestling, not as as,

373
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,640
but you still win like judo.
Ah.

374
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:52,690
And as you attempt the P and every time
the guy passed the back on the ground,

375
00:23:52,971 --> 00:23:56,870
you still making points.
So in my final match,

376
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,970
I guess the guy from the air force,

377
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:04,060
very strong guy with maybe wrestling and
judo background and he was whipping my

378
00:24:05,151 --> 00:24:08,990
ass man. He was just like, and
the first like three rounds,

379
00:24:08,991 --> 00:24:12,380
three minutes in the first round,
he stay on top all the time.

380
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:15,200
And because being in the
guide you're losing points.

381
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:20,030
The squad is about 12 or 14 points in
the first round in the second round is

382
00:24:20,031 --> 00:24:25,031
about 18 or 20 I tell you in the very
final round I was about 26 or something

383
00:24:28,581 --> 00:24:32,600
points against the zero,
you know,

384
00:24:32,601 --> 00:24:37,601
and I was just trying to do my think and
in one like maybe a minute before the

385
00:24:38,451 --> 00:24:40,460
very final Matt around,

386
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,750
I swept him and mounted and he
isn't the same time I mount it,

387
00:24:44,751 --> 00:24:49,751
he's tried to push me away and I get like
a moving arm luck and he not even tap,

388
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,493
he's just yell.

389
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:55,700
So and then I win the fight
like in the very final seconds.

390
00:24:55,701 --> 00:25:00,330
And you were down 20 something
points. I don't know, even chance.

391
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:04,710
I'm not there to, we need by points. I was
there just to see if I can submit. It's,

392
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:07,120
it's fascinating.
And then the guy that,

393
00:25:07,121 --> 00:25:12,121
but like 15 seconds before the fight is
in and then like the whole crowd was and

394
00:25:12,591 --> 00:25:15,150
then everything kind of who and then just

395
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,253
great.

396
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,280
No,
it's totally fine.

397
00:25:19,281 --> 00:25:23,210
So when Eric Paulson showed you
these tapes of shootout in the 90s,

398
00:25:23,211 --> 00:25:25,970
probably you already, you were already
doing leg locks a little bit, right?

399
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:29,810
I read that very like foot locks.
I always lost straight foot lock.

400
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,860
And then what Erik Paulsen showed you
was like fancy new bars and stuff. Yes,

401
00:25:33,861 --> 00:25:37,940
because from the guard you just spin
around and go with the straight knee law.

402
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:43,310
So I get, I get amazed by this
kind of, and I to develop,
you'll know very quickly.

403
00:25:43,311 --> 00:25:47,110
It was just adapt to my game and was an,
uh,

404
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,150
an addition to the arsenal.
You know, it was great.

405
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:53,390
It's funny when you look back at
old Eric Paulson fights in Japan,

406
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:56,750
you look at the stuff he was doing it
and people today still aren't even doing

407
00:25:56,751 --> 00:25:59,000
that because she's way
ahead of the game to it.

408
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:02,610
Eric Paulson was an encyclopedia
submissions, him and Matt,

409
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:07,730
those guys back then it looked like
like advanced Jujitsu and of course,

410
00:26:07,731 --> 00:26:11,020
you know anytime you got the mountain
there was always an arm bar, you know.

411
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,470
But uh, you know, that time Eric
was being trained very consistent.

412
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:19,610
[inaudible] he's a good, a good
brother in a training partner. We use,

413
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:23,420
always been a great warrior and
I have a lot of respect for him.

414
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,600
Great Guy. Very, very knowledgeable guy.

415
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:30,290
Isn't it fascinating that we've seen
just in the time that I started training

416
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:35,330
from 96 on this adoption of
leg locks in Jujitsu? Yes.

417
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:36,140
In the early,

418
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:40,670
in the 90s it used to be that leg locks
per frowned upon when when someone went

419
00:26:40,671 --> 00:26:44,250
for leg locks, people get really
upset. Hixon you at the first

420
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:49,320
Pan American games in 1996 and our
1997 here in Elsa Gundo and La,

421
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:52,560
you must have been there,
right? Do you remember that?

422
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,640
It was the first Pan Americans,
there was like 500 Brazilians.

423
00:26:56,641 --> 00:26:58,990
They shipped them all it were.

424
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:01,981
And there was,

425
00:27:01,981 --> 00:27:06,650
the crazy thing is I was a blue belt in
Jujitsu and I saw Ken shamrock tape of a

426
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:11,250
toehold. So I was a blue belt doing
told John Jacques Machado is academy.

427
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:15,930
And uh, I competed in the
tournament and so did Eric Paulson.

428
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:18,180
And when I went through a
toehold in this tournament,

429
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:20,700
all the Brazilians started
throwing that was almost a riot.

430
00:27:20,701 --> 00:27:23,970
They called the cough. There was the
one shoes at me and Johnny Machado.

431
00:27:23,971 --> 00:27:26,790
I'll never forget him running
in slow motion sliding.

432
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:31,060
And I had the toehold that Johnny goes,
you got to let it go. You got all this.

433
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:33,330
So I had to told, and I'm
looking around, so I let it go.

434
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:36,390
People are throwing shoes at
me and water bottles and stuff.

435
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:41,280
It was like a big deal. And I ended up
losing, I let it go. And afterwards,

436
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:43,470
Eric Paulson's in the parking lot,
it was just me and him.

437
00:27:43,471 --> 00:27:47,520
He was a blue belt as well. And he was
like his kid, we were like the same age,

438
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:49,950
but he was like, I was like a
little kid and he's like, you know,

439
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:52,940
let me talk to the kid and goes yeah,
let me show you a couple of leg locks.

440
00:27:52,941 --> 00:27:56,520
So he showed me a couple things like
this weirdest leg lock that doesn't work

441
00:27:56,521 --> 00:27:59,890
and he admits it now that it was garbage.
But he showed me this leg lock,

442
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:03,750
he showed me this leg lock where you go
like this is weird thing in the parking

443
00:28:03,751 --> 00:28:05,850
lot and I'll never forget
that. I was like, man,

444
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:09,330
this guy is the only guy who understands
that, that uh, I liked toeholds and,

445
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:12,330
and um, he was on my podcast
not too long ago and he said,

446
00:28:12,331 --> 00:28:14,490
and I asked him about that movie. Do
you remember that movie goes, Oh yeah,

447
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:18,750
it's garbage. It's trash as well.
Forget it raises that. Yeah.

448
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:22,140
Cause we got them outside. Isn't it
fascinating how these, these ideas,

449
00:28:22,141 --> 00:28:26,340
they get innovated and within our lifetime
they started to get implemented and

450
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:29,310
they get weeded out.
The ones that work wind up staying,

451
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:31,890
the ones that don't work
fall by the wayside.

452
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:36,330
What do you think about the
IBJ JF banning heel hooks?

453
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,260
You think that's a good
thing? I like, I like

454
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,800
to first,
um,

455
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:45,370
of course it's a pleasure to
talk about all this and uh,

456
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:50,400
I can answer that because I feel like the
heel hook has to be implemented in the

457
00:28:50,981 --> 00:28:55,981
top level fighters because
essence is a solid technique.

458
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:02,140
But because the is designed to
stretch the ligaments, not the joint.

459
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:07,380
You said difference between you going
in your finger this way. He's going to,

460
00:29:07,381 --> 00:29:10,900
you're going to feel pain
before it brokes yeah,

461
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:15,430
but if you go this way,
you're going to resist and to pop's.

462
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,260
So he's just, ligaments is not a joint.
This is a joint. This is a ligament.

463
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:22,270
So when you twist the knee,

464
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:26,440
the guy can still resist and when
he feels it's going to feel the pop,

465
00:29:26,441 --> 00:29:28,970
he's not going to feel the pain to tap.

466
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:33,640
So this is in a way,
if you don't have the experience,

467
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:35,740
you want to bust your knee.

468
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:40,600
So we don't want to see guys we've busted
me is just because they tough or just

469
00:29:40,601 --> 00:29:41,500
because they know.

470
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:46,210
So we four beat in a hole,
the the, the heel hooks,

471
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:51,250
but in the end and then had events
at level like met Amaury is,

472
00:29:51,251 --> 00:29:53,410
or like premium pros,

473
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:59,700
I think they should back bring back in
because this is part of the game and you

474
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:04,000
have to be responsible to let it broke
or tap. And especially a guy like Tokyo,

475
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:06,640
when you see Paul Horez,
he's such a master at it.

476
00:30:06,641 --> 00:30:09,850
It's exciting to watch that guy fight
to see how guys are going to deal with

477
00:30:09,851 --> 00:30:11,830
them. I would probably still
allows heel hooks, right?

478
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:14,980
That allows and Metamorris
I in my experience,

479
00:30:14,981 --> 00:30:18,370
I've been teaching now 10
years and we've uh, uh,

480
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:23,730
I allow heel hooks from day one
only because I as an instructor,

481
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:29,110
I don't want some leg lot guy coming
into my school and tap and everybody out

482
00:30:29,111 --> 00:30:29,860
with leg locks.

483
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:34,480
So I wanted all my guys to be
very well versed in leg locks.

484
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:38,800
And in my experience we reap,
we, he'll hook white belts.

485
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:42,460
I can't even tell you the last time
someone got hurt from it, he'll cook.

486
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:47,500
I kind of, I don't even know,
maybe, maybe once in 10 years,

487
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:52,180
think that that kind of education that's
going to positive because give the guy

488
00:30:52,181 --> 00:30:56,170
the sense he has to, if he feels
the problem has to tap in advance,

489
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,830
you cannot allow you to pop happen
because you're going to bust her knee.

490
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,750
And in Naga and grapplers quest,

491
00:31:01,751 --> 00:31:05,920
they allow heel hooks and you rarely
ever hear about anybody getting hurt.

492
00:31:05,921 --> 00:31:09,010
And I think,
I think once you learn how to defend it,

493
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:12,910
it's actually people don't want to,
people will tap generally.

494
00:31:12,911 --> 00:31:14,800
And some people that don't tap, uh, Gary,

495
00:31:14,801 --> 00:31:17,880
Tony was talking about the first time
someone got him in a heel hook and,

496
00:31:17,881 --> 00:31:21,850
and his knee popped a few
times. He thought, well, if
I tap now, it already popped.

497
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:26,920
Why should I tap? I should just keep
going now. And uh, um, if someone,

498
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:30,370
I think if someone is going to
let their knee pop or get hurt,

499
00:31:30,371 --> 00:31:34,420
I think it's their responsibility to tap.
And if it pops is,

500
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:37,870
is it really a big deal? I mean, it's
part of the game. People get hurt.

501
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:42,220
People get their knees blown out in
basketball way more than Jujitsu. Again,

502
00:31:42,221 --> 00:31:46,300
soccer. Yeah, I'm going in 10 years.
I, I can't even tell you that.

503
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:48,640
Maybe led compressions a couple of times.

504
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:52,150
Guys have had their knees pop from
led compressions and even locked down.

505
00:31:52,151 --> 00:31:56,230
I've had a couple of guys get their
knee pop, but heal hooks and reaping,

506
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:00,070
that's not something that I ever
had to say. We got to slow down.

507
00:32:00,071 --> 00:32:03,670
Be careful with the knee. Ribs,
just no one really gets hurt.

508
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:06,130
But seems to be a technique that
when people were ignorant of it,

509
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,650
that's when people were really
getting hurt more. Yeah,

510
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,460
it was some times when they really want
to go for the hood, they don't want to,

511
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,770
they don't visualize the,
the possibilities to hurt.

512
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:18,100
So they go in and go full power
from the beginning to the end.

513
00:32:18,101 --> 00:32:21,190
So he's not even a chance to the
guy that he's already tapping late.

514
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:25,870
So that's more like the,
the, the, the mindset of the,
the, the guy who's attacking.

515
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:29,590
If you, once you break your knee
is a great chance to do that then.

516
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:33,580
And when we were adding wrestling to our
Jujitsu classes, trying to combine it,

517
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:37,060
now we separate, we have separate restroom
classes and separate Jiu Jitsu class.

518
00:32:37,061 --> 00:32:40,070
But at a time when I was trying to
combine together, we would have a day

519
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:43,280
where we just do wrestling and we do live
ricin drills and we're all standing up.

520
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,490
That's where everyone got hurt and it got
to a point where he collided with each

521
00:32:46,491 --> 00:32:48,860
other and just trying to take
someone down and tackling them.

522
00:32:48,861 --> 00:32:53,330
And then they plant on their leg wrong.
Einstein broke his leg wrestling.

523
00:32:53,331 --> 00:32:57,000
It just was his leg broke cause he planted
on it wrong. He got picked up. So they,

524
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:58,940
there came a point where I decided,
you know what,

525
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:01,980
too many guys are getting
hurt on wrestling day.

526
00:33:01,981 --> 00:33:04,970
So I cut wrestling out and you know,
if you want to Russell,

527
00:33:04,971 --> 00:33:07,820
you go to the rest of the class
and my class is just Jujitsu.

528
00:33:07,821 --> 00:33:09,080
But we do allow reaping.

529
00:33:09,081 --> 00:33:12,080
We do allow heel hooks and there's
no one getting hurt from that.

530
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,250
More from the wrestling.

531
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:17,300
Does a famous match where
you had with Mark Schultz,

532
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:22,420
what was, what happened in that?
Because that's a very famous, uh,

533
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:27,380
encounter and there's a movie coming
out called Fox catcher that's based on,

534
00:33:27,381 --> 00:33:29,990
do you know the story behind this movie?
Um,

535
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:35,810
what was the guy's name that was a
responsible Fox catcher? It was based on,

536
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:40,100
there was the two brothers, the um, uh,

537
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:45,920
uh, all the one Marshall, David Schultz,
Dave Schultz got killed. And uh,

538
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:47,090
it's,
um,

539
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:52,390
it's based on this Guy John Dupont who
was this crazy rich guy who was taking

540
00:33:52,971 --> 00:33:56,780
these wrestlers and he was, I
dunno, it was some weird gay shit.

541
00:33:56,781 --> 00:33:59,150
There was something weird about
it. Pay For privates. He would,

542
00:33:59,151 --> 00:34:02,540
well not just that he set up a training
center and pay them a lot of money and

543
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:04,610
we just get real weird with them,
wrestle with these guys.

544
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:08,090
But he was like this old
dude and you know, it wasn't
like, he was like, you know,

545
00:34:08,091 --> 00:34:10,790
a guy who was really fit and really
in a training and learning techniques.

546
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:13,100
It was just real weird.
And you wind up shooting.

547
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:17,810
They creeped through every now and
then. Well, he was a billionaire.

548
00:34:17,811 --> 00:34:21,500
I mean it was super, super
rich guy. Um, uh, so this, uh,

549
00:34:21,501 --> 00:34:26,390
this movie's actually about to come out
now, but his brother, Mark Schultz was,

550
00:34:26,391 --> 00:34:30,620
uh, fought in the UFC Olympic
gold medalists. Fantastic
wrestler. Like all time.

551
00:34:30,621 --> 00:34:33,020
Great Wrestler.
And you and he had an encounter.

552
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:35,850
Yeah, well I was, uh, in a,

553
00:34:35,851 --> 00:34:38,970
in the Utah visiting my,

554
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:44,400
my struck to be editable Pedro
Sauer. Yes. And then, uh,

555
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:49,430
we are invited to go to the Byu where
he was coaching the wrestling wrestling

556
00:34:49,591 --> 00:34:53,540
team there. And as I get there, you know,

557
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:56,900
looking to for training stuff
and eventually he said, okay,

558
00:34:56,901 --> 00:35:00,750
let's train a little bit. And then, uh,

559
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:06,090
immediately we engage immediately he went
to my guard and almost immediately he

560
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:09,010
stepping out and then
he was not happy at all.

561
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:14,170
And then she put them in a triangle,
a triangle first from the guard. Yes.

562
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:17,950
And then he becomes a little more
smart and he kind of, it come it.

563
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:22,060
So it was a long second round.

564
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:26,800
And eventually I went to his back
and submit him again. And, um,

565
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:31,600
after a few, few sessions, I
make him tap some. And, uh,

566
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:36,010
and he was very impressed. Like,
wow, nobody did this with me. I mean,

567
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,900
what's on I, I mean, he was
stronger than me. I mean,

568
00:35:39,901 --> 00:35:44,040
of course a warrior. And
he was not happy. I mean,

569
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:46,470
uh, somebody said, once,

570
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,710
you show me a good loser
and I'll show you a loser.

571
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:55,740
So he was not happy at all. And, uh,
of course I, and I understood that.

572
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:58,050
And um, but eventually he, he,

573
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:03,280
he's saddle and he understood was it
technique involve and you start to become

574
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:08,420
the training with Pedro and uh,
become passionate about Jujitsu.

575
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:13,430
He training a lot and he become like a
supporter of the Jujitsu Cause in Utah.

576
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:15,930
And, uh, and you know,

577
00:36:15,931 --> 00:36:20,931
it was a great experience because I can
felt like the whole level of trainee and

578
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:25,620
in body control he has,
but it's still like at that point,

579
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:29,960
the rest of us has no clue
what is, you know, submissions.

580
00:36:29,961 --> 00:36:33,570
So what's kind of your not
surprising thing for them, which is,

581
00:36:33,571 --> 00:36:34,800
doesn't happen those days.

582
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:40,730
Do you remember specifically what moves
holes brought from a wrestling and,

583
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:46,020
and, uh, from Samba to how good
way distribuition a good ways to,

584
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:50,390
like if the guy grabbed you, you were
able to, to, to make the movement,

585
00:36:50,391 --> 00:36:54,690
you go to the, his back, like
a good turnovers. Um, a good,

586
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,090
excellent sense of, uh, Nogi base control,

587
00:36:58,091 --> 00:37:03,060
a good grips to charm drags and stuff
that thinks like a very, you know,

588
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:07,110
he was training a lot with, uh, Bob.

589
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:11,190
Bob Anderson. Yes. Yeah.

590
00:37:11,191 --> 00:37:14,670
So he was a good friend of Bob Anderson
and the barbarians to went to Brazil.

591
00:37:14,671 --> 00:37:15,540
So it was like,
uh,

592
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:20,930
he was the one who brought the wrestling
ideas and concepts because he pushed us

593
00:37:21,661 --> 00:37:25,680
once to compete in Olympic wrestling.
So it was,

594
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,820
Hobbes was always for me a
reference. You know, as I growing up,

595
00:37:29,821 --> 00:37:33,900
he was the champion and he
was just a unbelievable guy.

596
00:37:33,901 --> 00:37:37,860
We for good heart and a
passion for Zuihitsu loved,

597
00:37:37,861 --> 00:37:40,740
represent and he was my idol.
You know,

598
00:37:40,741 --> 00:37:45,741
as I grow in up and I tried to
follow his footsteps and uh,

599
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:51,500
as they grow a nap, we all train
hired among each other, we fathers.

600
00:37:51,501 --> 00:37:56,040
So my goal was beat halls. You know,
my goal was to be better than him.

601
00:37:56,041 --> 00:37:59,520
And let's suppose the,
our last 30 training,

602
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:03,540
uh, maybe he, he,

603
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:06,240
he beat me like in the first two or three.

604
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:11,250
And then we spend maybe 20
trainings or maybe 25 trainings,

605
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,820
even AARP,
like back and forth.

606
00:38:13,821 --> 00:38:17,610
I start to get modern morning to
his game and what this new strategy,

607
00:38:17,611 --> 00:38:19,170
Choo Choo catch me.

608
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:23,850
And I started to become more comfort
that when the surviving and then in one

609
00:38:23,851 --> 00:38:28,800
point I start getting dead vantage in
the training because no luck either w you

610
00:38:28,801 --> 00:38:29,640
better or not.

611
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:33,540
So in consistently I start to become
more comfort that when then eventually I

612
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:36,130
start to getting dead
vantage some positions.

613
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:40,750
And then in one day and the, and the
Rancho of my father, like in a weekend,

614
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:42,820
we all get together,
has a huge match.

615
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:47,620
So I was training with him
and I submit him first time,

616
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:52,970
you know, what'd you get them
with? A man was like, uh,

617
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:56,080
uh, um, you know, I hear an Ogee gree,

618
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:00,460
so you're not even remember.

619
00:39:00,461 --> 00:39:03,430
I think it was some kind of
choke or something. But, uh,

620
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,510
what I remember it was,
uh,

621
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:10,420
the feeling I felt by achieving my goal.

622
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:15,930
I was making him feel like
he was losing his position.

623
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,990
And I felt the same way.
I felt happy.

624
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:25,490
I felt sad because was not,
he is anymore. He's my self,

625
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:28,420
my responsibility now and we know that.

626
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:32,170
And nobody in the news, I
mean, nobody knew. I mean,

627
00:39:32,171 --> 00:39:33,550
of course people saw the training,

628
00:39:33,551 --> 00:39:38,551
but at that point I felt like I
was dare is still to support him,

629
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:45,490
but I was better than him and we
still competing and events coming.

630
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:49,270
And, uh, we always close the bracket
because he goes into his weight division.

631
00:39:49,271 --> 00:39:52,720
I go in mind and we go
together and the open division.

632
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:58,200
So we always close the open, you
know, and uh, I never will fight it.

633
00:39:58,230 --> 00:39:59,860
I mean,
up should that day.

634
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:04,030
He always been the first and I'm the
Saquon the Maddow is here is even though I

635
00:40:04,031 --> 00:40:07,750
knew I could maybe change this,
you know,

636
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:09,950
I never ever will,

637
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:13,660
if he's still alive he will be the
number one and I'm number two based on

638
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:17,920
respect base in, in Iraqi. So, uh,

639
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:21,280
once he passed away I have to take over,
you know,

640
00:40:21,281 --> 00:40:25,240
in represent fully and uh,
but was,

641
00:40:25,241 --> 00:40:28,060
I mean he is my inspiration and uh,

642
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:30,340
he's a great guy and then
he misses him dearly.

643
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,870
He died in a tragic hang gliding accident.
How old were you at that time?

644
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:39,070
Oh, I was, uh, maybe 20,
22, something like that.

645
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:41,920
So he was there when you
fought Zulu? Yes, he was.

646
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:45,090
He was my coach who was in
my corner with my dad from,

647
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:47,410
for people out there that don't
know what I'm talking about.

648
00:40:47,411 --> 00:40:50,050
The Zulu maps that you
had was one of them.

649
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:54,310
That's like watching an old Ali match.
Can you,

650
00:40:54,311 --> 00:40:59,110
can you put that up Jamie
actually versus Zulu? Yes.

651
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:03,760
I really, you know, this
conversation goes very well and I,

652
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:07,150
I mean, I really appreciate
your talking about the past,

653
00:41:07,151 --> 00:41:10,390
but I like should make a
little pause on this and,

654
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:15,190
and really bring up the most,

655
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,440
because we have to leave today.

656
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:22,090
We have to be motivated and I'm very
happy today to come here to explain and

657
00:41:22,091 --> 00:41:26,170
talk about this new
venture I'm involved with,

658
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:31,200
which is the new Jj GF
Jujitsu global federation.

659
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:35,600
Because talking about Jujitsu,
talking about rules,

660
00:41:35,601 --> 00:41:39,650
talking about the future of shoe she had.
So I think,

661
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:43,880
uh, we having a huge problem
to be resolved, you know,

662
00:41:43,881 --> 00:41:46,790
and that's is crucial for the future.

663
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:53,080
I see like this new organization will
bring to the table the elements to resolve

664
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:57,320
our problem.
You know,

665
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:03,460
I think our biggest problem today
and they shoot so community is losing

666
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:06,470
effectiveness.

667
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:12,580
We be losing effectiveness drastically
from the last 15 years because um,

668
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:21,770
the way in order for us
to restore effectiveness,

669
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:26,150
I felt very appealing to me
to engage in this venture,

670
00:42:26,151 --> 00:42:31,151
which through this federation we are
going to try to resolve three important,

671
00:42:32,391 --> 00:42:36,290
I mean we have three pillars of, of, of,

672
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:40,670
of action to try to resolve that problem.

673
00:42:40,671 --> 00:42:45,300
Jujitsu has effectiveness in what an
MNF effective and like a fight. No,

674
00:42:45,301 --> 00:42:46,400
no effectiveness.

675
00:42:46,401 --> 00:42:51,401
I want to explain to you because it's
different efficiency and effectiveness

676
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:58,270
today I see the top camp champions very
efficient on getting medals but they

677
00:43:01,341 --> 00:43:03,560
losing effectiveness in real life.

678
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:08,720
And if you see Jujitsu as I grew up,

679
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:14,230
the core of Jujitsu was self defense
isn't preparing the students to handle

680
00:43:14,541 --> 00:43:15,440
situations.

681
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:21,050
Should they be evolutionary process
of associates who brought the sport of

682
00:43:21,051 --> 00:43:26,051
Jujitsu and those rules diminishing
that effectiveness in the search for the

683
00:43:28,251 --> 00:43:33,170
medal. So, and I like
nothing can be boring for me,

684
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:36,380
more boring then watch some
fights in Jujitsu tournaments.

685
00:43:36,381 --> 00:43:38,210
Those days I believe in I'm in,

686
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:43,220
they can choose between stepping
on the brake or stepping on the,

687
00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:44,143
on the guests.

688
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:49,720
They can choose because the rules
favor if you strategically correct,

689
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:55,490
you may go to go in the fight to fight
as situation where you can control the

690
00:43:55,491 --> 00:43:56,540
pace of the fight.

691
00:43:56,990 --> 00:44:00,680
You can managing the whole tank
and eventually by one or two moves,

692
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:04,940
you get advantage. And when the
model so great you have the metal,

693
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:10,360
but sometimes that's chose
a lack of desire to compete,

694
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:15,200
a lack of desire to engage
in a fair fight. La,

695
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:19,220
a lot of times they see our white belt
or a blue belt or a purple belt fight,

696
00:44:19,221 --> 00:44:23,590
which is much more appealing, has
much more open situations, of course,

697
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:25,490
of changing positions.

698
00:44:25,491 --> 00:44:30,110
Then a black belt who sometimes sit
on the floor and it stuck like an

699
00:44:30,111 --> 00:44:31,950
acquisition who holds

700
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:37,050
stalling the whole action.
So by doing that,

701
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:39,120
he's efficient on get the medal,

702
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:42,420
but he's losing effective
is to handle real life.

703
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:47,720
That's why is hard to see as you
[inaudible] representative on the cage.

704
00:44:49,050 --> 00:44:52,730
Who translates that?
I mean I seizures.

705
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:57,600
It's translates your day something I feel
like I never, we would fight like that.

706
00:44:57,630 --> 00:45:01,980
The guys who shoots a practitioner
for life, his greatest talent,

707
00:45:01,981 --> 00:45:04,260
he's tough.
He's sometimes a champion,

708
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:07,980
but he don't fight the way I believe
it's supposed to be fighting there.

709
00:45:07,981 --> 00:45:11,970
You know, he has no idea of
clinching. He has no idea of sidekick,

710
00:45:12,010 --> 00:45:14,520
has no idea of a volley to the guard.

711
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:17,970
They have a sportive guide all the time
trying to do a more plotters in the,

712
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:22,210
you know, instead, and the guy on top
just hammering them down. So it's,

713
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:26,970
it's kind of weird because
without that kind of efficiency,

714
00:45:27,270 --> 00:45:31,470
I mean, I'm sorry, effectiveness.
A Jujitsu is losing,

715
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:36,660
you know, he's losing, uh, the
integrity, the whole culture,

716
00:45:36,661 --> 00:45:40,200
the whole concepts I trust
and I believe all my life.

717
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:41,700
So if I can clarify your,

718
00:45:41,701 --> 00:45:46,200
your issue is with points and
with advantage points. Yes.

719
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:51,080
For example, the new, this
new situation will be, uh,

720
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:55,680
this federation is not there to, to,
to compete with other organizations.

721
00:45:55,770 --> 00:45:57,380
I'm not there to,
I,

722
00:45:57,450 --> 00:46:01,740
I'm doing the job was not done yet.
You know,

723
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:06,030
based on this platform,
this state of DRM platform,

724
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:09,960
we try to have three different
elements to work with

725
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:12,480
de formation.

726
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:18,770
I think division is to perform
something or good service.

727
00:46:19,770 --> 00:46:24,770
Mine tension with this is to serve
the community in the sport community,

728
00:46:27,310 --> 00:46:30,420
the worldwide Jujitsu community.
In the sport of Jujitsu,

729
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:34,590
thinking that I have
three different elements.

730
00:46:34,591 --> 00:46:36,640
The first one is the communication aspect.

731
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:41,660
Information through the site you're going
to have a listing of all the academies

732
00:46:42,031 --> 00:46:42,864
on the planet.

733
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:47,940
We have a listing of all
at the athletes profiles,

734
00:46:47,941 --> 00:46:49,380
downloads of fights.

735
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:54,070
So they will have the
option to request sponsors,

736
00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:55,970
show themselves.
It's like a,

737
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:59,700
a Google slash Facebook for the community.

738
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:04,650
And uh, also we're going
to have a master's council,

739
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:09,700
which brings all the guys who have
traditionally spend their lives in, in,

740
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:14,550
in the Jujitsu community to have a voice,
active voice for the community.

741
00:47:14,551 --> 00:47:18,960
So in the forums, sometimes, uh,

742
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:22,350
somebody makes a question
about a position,

743
00:47:22,530 --> 00:47:26,390
so the master's will be involving
answers if they want and they will be

744
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:30,700
highlighted because that's his
opinion, that's opinion. And so people,

745
00:47:30,701 --> 00:47:34,630
the community want to start to evaluate
what's beneficial and what's negative,

746
00:47:34,631 --> 00:47:36,280
what's the master has to say.

747
00:47:36,281 --> 00:47:40,990
So creates a network which is must
need it to unified. The community.

748
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:46,030
I see the communities, should they
completely split, you know, they did.

749
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:50,770
Some federations had their own circuits,
some either. So it's 30 sec, 30 events,

750
00:47:50,771 --> 00:47:54,550
one side, I'm under 30 and the
other side. And then has, you know,

751
00:47:54,551 --> 00:47:58,840
Nag a seven Grep request,
have dream,

752
00:47:58,841 --> 00:48:00,700
have IBJ JF.

753
00:48:00,970 --> 00:48:05,970
So all this is completely
disorganized and completely split.

754
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:11,590
So my intention is brink to the community.
A sense of,

755
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:17,700
of unity unification based on this
information who is go for every,

756
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:22,830
like another important point is have
contributors from all over to breaking

757
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:27,040
their reports of what's happening
in this event. Who's the champion,

758
00:48:27,041 --> 00:48:31,270
who is dead and news and everything.
So because some magazines should they,

759
00:48:31,330 --> 00:48:32,590
they completely partial,

760
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:38,100
they just will talk and explain about
bear athletes or in their society does not

761
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:43,420
cover the whole community. So
to this information, this solid,

762
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:48,550
uh, efficient, uh, general information,

763
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:53,530
the general, the whole community
will be informed, we'll be connected,

764
00:48:53,531 --> 00:48:55,660
will be asking and being listened.

765
00:48:56,470 --> 00:48:59,980
So I think that's a very
important for the community.

766
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:03,520
Another big pillar of our,

767
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:06,880
our federation is the competition aspect,

768
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:11,350
which by changing rules
we restore effectiveness.

769
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:15,580
How we do that,
cutting the advantages.

770
00:49:15,610 --> 00:49:18,190
Because the advantage for me,
it's like a,

771
00:49:18,670 --> 00:49:23,050
a ball in the ring is just touch.
The ring doesn't make a point.

772
00:49:23,051 --> 00:49:25,500
How are you going to make
a half point or it's, it's,

773
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:29,530
it's the very hard to interpretate
what is really real and what is not.

774
00:49:29,531 --> 00:49:30,730
What's our most,

775
00:49:31,150 --> 00:49:35,470
I mean it doesn't matter how many
goals you try and hit the post.

776
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:38,140
The score is what matters,
you know?

777
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:43,141
So I have points just creates a
controversy in the interpretation for the

778
00:49:43,151 --> 00:49:46,630
referee for so becomes
a very confused way.

779
00:49:47,290 --> 00:49:50,890
So back to the reality,
you just go four clear points.

780
00:49:51,430 --> 00:49:56,430
And also another important thing is
give mine was points for installing

781
00:49:57,670 --> 00:49:59,110
positions.
What is it?

782
00:49:59,111 --> 00:50:04,111
Stalling position is a position where
you hold with the intention to preserve

783
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:05,950
their position,

784
00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:10,240
to preserve the control of
the dynamic of the fight.

785
00:50:10,270 --> 00:50:15,270
You stalling because you want to be
in control by using what I call a anti

786
00:50:16,031 --> 00:50:20,320
Jujitsu move,
which prevents you from

787
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:27,100
keep action. Because the idea is go
both engage and see who's the best,

788
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:28,220
who is submit,
who's

789
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:30,740
passing, who is mounting, who is getting.

790
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:33,770
And sometimes people
to minimize that risk.

791
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:36,950
They kind of keeping the
situation on the UCONTROL,

792
00:50:36,951 --> 00:50:38,270
the position they can control.

793
00:50:38,271 --> 00:50:43,271
This leaves putting the lag in tango it
so he's comfortable to proceed and to

794
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:45,710
the point he needs to
make a little advanced.

795
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:51,080
So this diminish the effect of in is
because this kind of strategy doesn't work

796
00:50:51,081 --> 00:50:54,460
in real life. So they were
punished for that. Any grabbing,

797
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:56,990
grabbing the referee come and say,
Hey man,

798
00:50:56,991 --> 00:51:01,040
watch your grip after 20 seconds
he already got a minus point after.

799
00:51:01,041 --> 00:51:03,500
Then they're going to get mine was again.

800
00:51:03,501 --> 00:51:05,150
And then eventually you're going to be DQ.

801
00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:10,020
Is it subject to interpretation whether
a guy is stalling or they're guys just,

802
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:11,970
if they're canceling each other out?

803
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:15,240
I'm sorry if it's subject
to interpretation,

804
00:51:15,241 --> 00:51:18,060
whether it's stalling or whether or
not they're canceling each other out.

805
00:51:18,061 --> 00:51:21,330
Like one guy is trying to advance the
other guy stopping them at for advanced.

806
00:51:21,331 --> 00:51:23,370
They just both looking for the opening.

807
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:24,001
Yeah.

808
00:51:24,001 --> 00:51:29,001
But you can see easily who is wants to
progress and who's once you just control

809
00:51:29,731 --> 00:51:33,810
the position for this guy who
don't want to progress, he will be,

810
00:51:33,870 --> 00:51:36,730
I mean you can notice it.
I mean in theory may is,

811
00:51:36,990 --> 00:51:41,400
but if you see it you can see who's just
trying to minimize the action and try

812
00:51:41,401 --> 00:51:45,480
to wait for their opportunity and the
other one who's tried to make it happen,

813
00:51:45,481 --> 00:51:48,390
you know, what about submission
only tournament's do you let those,

814
00:51:48,450 --> 00:51:51,870
the federation also have this kind
of rule. We have two sets of rules,

815
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:57,560
the point rules system for tournaments
and we have the challenge rules for can

816
00:51:58,351 --> 00:52:03,351
be even timing but for match
for matchmaking like the
Metamorris skyline or or

817
00:52:03,690 --> 00:52:07,620
any promoter who tried to do
something like the baddest,

818
00:52:07,650 --> 00:52:12,600
the baddest purple belt. So there's
no way division is no time limit.

819
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:16,560
He can approach that the time as you wish.
Like okay let,

820
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:20,220
we'll be 20 minutes Max. We will be 50
minutes match will be half hour match.

821
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:23,190
We can think about Gracie worlds
and Gracie nationals. They,

822
00:52:23,191 --> 00:52:27,360
it's all submission only. And after 15
minutes, if there's no sub submission,

823
00:52:27,570 --> 00:52:30,330
they're both disqualified.
I disagree with that.

824
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:34,860
That that disqualification
I spoke with hose and uh,

825
00:52:34,890 --> 00:52:38,880
she may be, I mean we want to get
into the better for the Jujitsu,

826
00:52:38,881 --> 00:52:42,390
but for me it's the same
roles in case of a bracket.

827
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:47,940
So I don't feel like both
who kind of didn't submit,

828
00:52:47,970 --> 00:52:52,970
suppose sue should be disqualified because
sometimes in the same bracket should

829
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:58,140
tough guys, they fight each other and
they could not submit to each other.

830
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:02,500
And then some too,
I mean halfway busters.

831
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:04,800
Yes they want submit the order.

832
00:53:04,830 --> 00:53:08,280
So this guy advances and
those two are disqualified.

833
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:11,160
So I don't think this is fair.
Somebody has to come in from this.

834
00:53:11,550 --> 00:53:16,550
So the way I did is the first round goes
full force and if the 20 minutes sand

835
00:53:18,231 --> 00:53:20,550
or 30 minutes,
then it depends on the arrangement.

836
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,640
After the 20 minutes you ask
the guy you want to fight,

837
00:53:23,970 --> 00:53:27,450
the guy said yes and then ass Nigga you
want to fight. Yes. So He's another round.

838
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:31,560
So in the second round,
we still don't have positive points,

839
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:36,890
but every time the guy put himself in
a position and he started defending

840
00:53:37,070 --> 00:53:40,110
himself without attempting to
escape or giving the combat,

841
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:44,070
just protecting or resting or whatever,

842
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:45,900
the referee going to say,
hey man,

843
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:48,660
keep going acting or you're
going to be penalized.

844
00:53:48,661 --> 00:53:53,661
So we have negative points for diminishing
of combat tivity so at the end of the

845
00:53:56,071 --> 00:54:00,410
second round, if we see like, uh,

846
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:04,080
somebody with mine was points, this
one will be the loser, you know,

847
00:54:04,081 --> 00:54:09,081
because he displayed last desire or less
gas or less techniques to be on top of

848
00:54:10,561 --> 00:54:12,870
the, the con, the con, the competition.

849
00:54:12,870 --> 00:54:16,290
So his mind was because
he's defending all the time,

850
00:54:16,291 --> 00:54:18,120
he was tired or whatever.

851
00:54:18,121 --> 00:54:22,910
So he gets minus points and then the
other guy advances for the brackets.

852
00:54:22,911 --> 00:54:25,200
So that's the only change
for this submission.

853
00:54:25,410 --> 00:54:29,520
Are you familiar with my avid
submission only tournament as well?

854
00:54:29,550 --> 00:54:30,570
I don't know if you're aware of that.

855
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,660
And it's very similar to Gracie
world's Gracie nationals,

856
00:54:33,661 --> 00:54:36,720
but both at 15 minute matches,

857
00:54:36,721 --> 00:54:39,090
but both competitors aren't disqualified.

858
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:43,080
We actually have an overtime round
and and that and the overtime,

859
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:47,890
it's kind of like soccer.
I didn't want overtimes to be uh,

860
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:50,190
determined by wrestling
and a lot of tournament,

861
00:54:50,191 --> 00:54:51,660
it's like you go into overtime and,

862
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:54,900
and whoever's the best wrestler wins
because you get to take that and then they

863
00:54:54,901 --> 00:54:58,410
hold and they went. So a lot of
wrestlers can go into tournaments and go,

864
00:54:58,411 --> 00:55:00,180
I'm just going to stall for regulation,

865
00:55:00,390 --> 00:55:04,350
taking into overtime and when with my
wrestling. So in order to eliminate that,

866
00:55:04,650 --> 00:55:08,370
I wanted to know who the best submission
artist is, not who the best wrestler is.

867
00:55:08,371 --> 00:55:12,270
So my overtime, each person,
like if we went into overtime,

868
00:55:12,390 --> 00:55:17,220
you get to start on my back with the leg
cooks and an over under. And then we go,

869
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:22,560
if you submit me, then I get to go on
your back. And if you escape you win.

870
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:26,370
But if I submit you, then we'd
go another round. It's just,

871
00:55:26,371 --> 00:55:30,390
it's like a extra innings and then the
next round you take my back, I escape,

872
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:34,470
I take your back and I submit you, I
win. That's an a dreamland of course.

873
00:55:34,471 --> 00:55:39,471
But we that way we get to find
out who the best is at submitting.

874
00:55:40,350 --> 00:55:42,000
We couldn't finish and regulation.

875
00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:45,930
Now we go into overtime and we start
on each other's backs. Like free kicks.

876
00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:46,890
Yeah but I think,

877
00:55:46,891 --> 00:55:51,480
I think this is a valid but you take
the element of conquer that position.

878
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:55,590
I think the fight has to
be leaving in standing up.

879
00:55:55,620 --> 00:56:00,620
If the rest of the statue avoiding any
avoiding of combat activity supposed to

880
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:03,450
be penalized but allow,

881
00:56:03,570 --> 00:56:07,140
you could fake that though like a wrestler
could fake it like take shots and one

882
00:56:07,141 --> 00:56:11,880
thing is for sure in this new federation
and the same way we have the master

883
00:56:11,881 --> 00:56:12,714
council,

884
00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:16,350
we're going to have the development
council and you are going to be invited

885
00:56:16,351 --> 00:56:19,590
right now to be part
because I see people like

886
00:56:21,690 --> 00:56:24,040
you guys are not just know the

887
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:29,040
deal no that the sport but
also has opinion Shumake
and my idea is not riding my

888
00:56:30,071 --> 00:56:31,150
rules and stone.

889
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:36,480
My idea is to follow the best pattern
to create more effectiveness and more

890
00:56:36,641 --> 00:56:38,380
dynamic aspect for the sports.

891
00:56:38,381 --> 00:56:43,381
So the federation has this open heart
and open eye and open years to kind of

892
00:56:44,291 --> 00:56:49,120
make the best conclusions for the sport.
So all the rules can be changed.

893
00:56:49,150 --> 00:56:51,370
Everything can be adapted to a better,

894
00:56:52,090 --> 00:56:55,990
more define display off effectiveness.

895
00:56:56,350 --> 00:56:57,220
That's a beautiful thing.

896
00:56:57,370 --> 00:57:00,880
When will this go into effect and when
will your first and injury? No, no,

897
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:05,830
I'm not playing only in events.
My idea is to serve service.

898
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:10,750
So I got to service through the
information I going to serve as to giving

899
00:57:10,751 --> 00:57:13,300
reference in giving
guidance for the events.

900
00:57:13,810 --> 00:57:17,080
But even though they don't do my rules,

901
00:57:17,470 --> 00:57:20,980
I will legitimize everybody.
And I,

902
00:57:20,981 --> 00:57:25,510
you start to relate the records of every
event who went here, who went there.

903
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:30,640
And I start to putting everybody to become
part of the same profile, the same, uh,

904
00:57:30,730 --> 00:57:31,750
mindset.

905
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:37,020
And I will hammer the idea of why we don't
do the best rules for Jujitsu because

906
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:42,610
I bet they champions, should they, many of
them, they're gonna say, oh, I don't like,

907
00:57:42,611 --> 00:57:46,960
I prefer to this or that, but I'm
not here to educate those champions.

908
00:57:46,961 --> 00:57:51,961
I'm here to educate 85% of the competitive
community today who is still white

909
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:55,660
and blue belt.
Those guys,

910
00:57:55,661 --> 00:58:00,661
they've been misled to understand the
strategy of the game to get the meadows

911
00:58:01,630 --> 00:58:04,480
but they losing
effectiveness in real life.

912
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:10,200
So the change of rules aside of the
education aspect of the federation is very

913
00:58:12,641 --> 00:58:13,474
important.

914
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:18,750
How I see the service of the federation
and the educational level because a lot

915
00:58:20,411 --> 00:58:25,360
of times guys coming from the competitive
background and they from white to

916
00:58:25,361 --> 00:58:29,680
purple to Moran and black so
they become tough competitors.

917
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:31,780
Sometimes champions they become famous.

918
00:58:31,781 --> 00:58:36,781
Then they opened the school and as they
opened the school they teach what they

919
00:58:36,911 --> 00:58:37,744
know.

920
00:58:38,590 --> 00:58:43,590
That techniques who make
them few champions so great
but this is just like a a

921
00:58:44,531 --> 00:58:49,531
percentage off what he supposed to know
to teach because not everybody wants to

922
00:58:50,621 --> 00:58:51,970
debt go that you compete.

923
00:58:52,390 --> 00:58:56,890
Not everybody has the skills and the
toughness to engage in a in that kind of

924
00:58:56,891 --> 00:58:58,540
level of training.

925
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:03,490
I feel like Jujitsu is there to
favor the the community as a whole.

926
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:05,290
I feel like the instructor,

927
00:59:05,530 --> 00:59:09,310
he has to be knowledgeable
about self defense,

928
00:59:09,610 --> 00:59:13,660
about self defense for women,
about programs for kids,

929
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:16,360
kids class in law enforcement.

930
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:20,740
So as the structor become certified,
I mean I'm not,

931
00:59:20,830 --> 00:59:24,140
I going to validate all
the audit, the, the, the,

932
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:27,290
the destructors,
all the black belts today,

933
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:29,250
I'm not going to say you don't deserve it,

934
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:34,540
but I will suggest to them
to get certified through
the federation because they

935
00:59:35,331 --> 00:59:40,331
will get elements for dairy
schools become more efficient,

936
00:59:40,761 --> 00:59:43,760
retained more students,
had a better teaching programs,

937
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:47,840
which are the core of effectiveness.

938
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:53,380
And the other day I heard some black
belts being asked for a student about self

939
00:59:53,511 --> 00:59:57,800
defense, hey teacher, you teach? He said,
no, no. If you want to self defense,

940
00:59:57,830 --> 01:00:00,970
you go to grab my guy. You
know. And I felt that's,

941
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:04,520
this is just something who is
goes in straight on my heart.

942
01:00:04,521 --> 01:00:07,910
Because for me, the core
of Jujitsu, self defense,

943
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:10,490
if you don't know selfdefence
basically you don't know Jujitsu.

944
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:14,630
You have to be ready to shoot,
choose to defend yourself from a slapping,

945
01:00:14,631 --> 01:00:17,420
from a hug, from a
headlock, from whatever.

946
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:21,410
And if you don't have those concepts
lineup, you become sometimes very path.

947
01:00:21,411 --> 01:00:24,980
We've tough years with very
good grip and dudents forever,

948
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:29,360
but you still counting on your own
physicality. You still counting.

949
01:00:29,570 --> 01:00:32,750
You cannot teach that for
the children or for a women.

950
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:38,500
So by having differation presenting those
courses in any spreading this all over

951
01:00:39,951 --> 01:00:40,850
the,
the word,

952
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:45,880
the teacher will have much more elements
to have Molly students to feed the,

953
01:00:46,090 --> 01:00:49,130
the have more knowledge
to feed, you know, the,

954
01:00:49,150 --> 01:00:51,170
here's the students in
different levels and,

955
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:55,940
and make a different job with Jujitsu,
you know, so this is beautiful.

956
01:00:55,940 --> 01:00:58,430
So your motivation is just
to improve digits. Yes.

957
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:00,560
You see a bad direction that it's going.

958
01:01:00,561 --> 01:01:05,270
Usually it's as losing effectiveness and
we have to restore that buy in for me

959
01:01:05,271 --> 01:01:10,271
very well by understand the competition
as a progressive thing to make you

960
01:01:11,451 --> 01:01:15,500
better fight or not to make a
better competitor. You know,

961
01:01:15,530 --> 01:01:18,530
if you're a competitor
sometimes at taekwondo guy,

962
01:01:18,740 --> 01:01:22,580
he's a great competitor but has
nothing to do with real life. I mean,

963
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,530
you want to be a fighter.
Jujitsu is something you learn to protect,

964
01:01:27,531 --> 01:01:31,820
your honor, to protect your dignity,
chew, to represent, to fight,

965
01:01:31,850 --> 01:01:34,730
to make money in the cage wherever you,
your goals are.

966
01:01:35,390 --> 01:01:38,870
Jujitsu is there to support you
in a very profound and deep cause,

967
01:01:38,871 --> 01:01:41,600
which is effectness effectiveness.

968
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:47,800
The transition between Jujitsu and Jujitsu
competition and mixed martial arts is

969
01:01:47,801 --> 01:01:51,170
it's a very tricky transition for
a lot of Jujitsu fighters. Yes.

970
01:01:51,290 --> 01:01:55,430
Especially when they don't have that
kind of constant strong background.

971
01:01:55,940 --> 01:01:59,720
You know, I think if everybody
who fights like crown,

972
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:03,480
we don't have to set up rules because
he wants to accelerate. He wants,

973
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:08,090
he wants to be progressive, you know,
he's not, once you won by points,

974
01:02:08,091 --> 01:02:11,060
he wants to go to the kill. So, uh,

975
01:02:11,061 --> 01:02:14,420
guys like him or Bouschet show
or some other great athletes,

976
01:02:14,450 --> 01:02:18,380
they go and they choose to fight openly.
You know,

977
01:02:18,990 --> 01:02:22,590
to see some other fights.
They choose the strategy,

978
01:02:22,660 --> 01:02:27,270
strategic elements to just give
them more chances. Just points,

979
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:28,740
just points,
just advantages.

980
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:33,360
Sometimes 10 minutes fight
Hannafin happened is just
to advantage that stared at

981
01:02:33,361 --> 01:02:36,750
women. I don't expect you see
this in a fight and nobody speaks.

982
01:02:36,751 --> 01:02:40,050
So by changing rules,
we increase effectiveness.

983
01:02:40,380 --> 01:02:44,490
We create a more dynamic fights is
more interesting to see, you know,

984
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:46,290
nobody wants to see something boring.

985
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:51,920
And we create under this
concept the possibility to
unified the whole community.

986
01:02:54,330 --> 01:02:59,010
Not only this particular
association or this federation,

987
01:02:59,011 --> 01:03:00,750
but everybody in the same polite.

988
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:04,680
And then without taking
anything from nobody,

989
01:03:05,250 --> 01:03:10,250
my vision is to create a
worldwide circuit of Jujitsu,

990
01:03:12,270 --> 01:03:15,390
which represents the same thing.

991
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:19,290
They are ASP for surf
or the att for tennis,

992
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:24,680
which brings major players
like big sponsors and and,

993
01:03:24,981 --> 01:03:29,640
and until a vision for the sport.
So first is unified,

994
01:03:29,670 --> 01:03:31,020
try to unify the rules,

995
01:03:31,021 --> 01:03:35,610
try to create effective is try to give
a better condition for the teacher,

996
01:03:35,611 --> 01:03:38,190
for the school Warner,
for the independent promoter.

997
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:40,710
Because I cannot think and about,
okay,

998
01:03:40,711 --> 01:03:44,070
I'm going to start to make my
own circus and I don't validate,

999
01:03:44,071 --> 01:03:47,070
nobody's just me like other people do.

1000
01:03:47,071 --> 01:03:50,700
So that's a a wrong way to unified and,

1001
01:03:50,701 --> 01:03:54,840
and in educate the community
in our culture for the future.

1002
01:03:55,030 --> 01:03:58,320
Raul said publicly that he
feels a part of the problem,

1003
01:03:58,321 --> 01:04:02,500
the stalling problem is the holding
of the sleeves. Do you think, uh,

1004
01:04:02,510 --> 01:04:05,730
is there a path? I, that's what I
think too. I totally agree with them.

1005
01:04:05,731 --> 01:04:08,860
I think the fact that you
have to have your sleeve,

1006
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:12,750
you can't have your sleeve type because
then your opponent can't grab it.

1007
01:04:12,990 --> 01:04:14,550
I think that is so backwards.

1008
01:04:14,580 --> 01:04:18,660
I think that it should be illegal
to grab the sleeve illegal.

1009
01:04:18,750 --> 01:04:23,270
I think it should be illegal. I think I
think is possible to be illegal. What is,

1010
01:04:23,580 --> 01:04:28,580
what is unacceptable is that grip
promotes is only a cool off situation.

1011
01:04:29,461 --> 01:04:33,840
I can grab anywhere I want. If my
intention is to progress. Yeah.

1012
01:04:34,110 --> 01:04:36,750
If I start to say, okay, come into me,

1013
01:04:36,751 --> 01:04:40,170
come into papa and I stay here waiting
to waste your energy and then when you

1014
01:04:40,171 --> 01:04:44,310
make a mistake I sweep you. That's
kind of weak. Weak in your mindset.

1015
01:04:44,311 --> 01:04:47,220
We can your progressiveness weekend,
your effectiveness.

1016
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:48,570
So what if he stuck there?

1017
01:04:48,571 --> 01:04:52,490
Like he has sleep and he stuck cause
he's trying to pass and if p let's go of

1018
01:04:52,491 --> 01:04:55,560
the sleeve then you're going to pass and
it kind of just stuck there and you're

1019
01:04:55,561 --> 01:04:58,270
like I can't let go of the
sleeve because let him home man,

1020
01:04:58,280 --> 01:04:59,700
let it go and go for the risk.

1021
01:04:59,701 --> 01:05:02,220
Don't you think that would cause
problems with the RAF and the refs

1022
01:05:02,260 --> 01:05:03,810
interpretation of what stolen.

1023
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:08,790
Whatever is holding you feel
not moving is a stalling.

1024
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:11,250
So you should have the MOU,

1025
01:05:11,251 --> 01:05:15,540
hip movement and the angles and the
quick fast on the news, whatever you do.

1026
01:05:16,060 --> 01:05:18,520
Because if the guy don't
make a complete pass

1027
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:23,060
you still like arm was no advantage.
Yeah. So it's just keep going man.

1028
01:05:23,260 --> 01:05:25,330
Do you think it's less
of an issue with Nogi

1029
01:05:28,490 --> 01:05:29,940
is less because you know gay,

1030
01:05:29,950 --> 01:05:33,610
you can stall in the 50 fifties and
different things will be easier,

1031
01:05:34,150 --> 01:05:36,970
but you have much less elements to submit.

1032
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:42,600
I feel like they know gay is just take
maybe 70% of the submission options.

1033
01:05:43,570 --> 01:05:46,600
Still some classic ones but not that many.

1034
01:05:47,350 --> 01:05:50,830
So I feel like it's just last options,
but it's still the same.

1035
01:05:50,890 --> 01:05:52,090
Exactly the same fight.

1036
01:05:52,410 --> 01:05:56,310
When you did the Butoh challenge, we went
to see that it was a great, great event.

1037
01:05:56,850 --> 01:06:00,430
What has changed since your,
your ideas when you put that on?

1038
01:06:00,860 --> 01:06:05,860
My ideas are the same would the challenge
is a great rule for I stream event for

1039
01:06:06,261 --> 01:06:11,261
a prime television event is not a sport
competition event because ames the

1040
01:06:12,111 --> 01:06:17,111
submission and only pros competing and
it's like a premium sensational thank

1041
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:21,840
which has no time for stalling
is all pushing forward.

1042
01:06:21,841 --> 01:06:25,610
So the whole pressure
I think is almost that,

1043
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:29,210
but in the tournaments has to
be a little more supportive.

1044
01:06:29,211 --> 01:06:31,400
We have to have points,
we have to have a time limit,

1045
01:06:31,401 --> 01:06:36,020
which is a quarterly to the the the
the bout and so, but it's the idea,

1046
01:06:36,050 --> 01:06:40,730
the concept of progressive concept
of going to the submission has to be

1047
01:06:41,210 --> 01:06:44,960
embraced. I mean it has to be in their
whole mindset for every fighter, you know,

1048
01:06:44,961 --> 01:06:45,660
it's not,

1049
01:06:45,660 --> 01:06:50,660
it doesn't change the way you fight has
to be folk was on the submit the guy to

1050
01:06:51,261 --> 01:06:54,560
be the best, the best one out there.
When is your first big tournament?

1051
01:06:54,561 --> 01:06:56,700
Are you planning on having a big worlds?

1052
01:06:56,840 --> 01:07:01,520
I want to have like a in October
the first event, but I already have,

1053
01:07:01,610 --> 01:07:06,470
for example, next week, uh, in the
second and third, the Vulcan Open.

1054
01:07:06,860 --> 01:07:09,800
They, we will apply the new
rules and it's all testing.

1055
01:07:09,801 --> 01:07:13,820
We're going to test the rules to
see because the idea is a positive,

1056
01:07:13,821 --> 01:07:15,530
beneficial idea for the sport.

1057
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:19,250
And if we need to adjust a little
more than change, like I said,

1058
01:07:19,251 --> 01:07:22,730
it's not funny on the stone yet and
we're going to allow the think too,

1059
01:07:22,731 --> 01:07:23,630
if you know,

1060
01:07:23,660 --> 01:07:28,660
hearing people and see and the conclusions
because the mission is very positive

1061
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:34,390
and the means we will be adaptable.
That's a beautiful thing. Yes,

1062
01:07:34,660 --> 01:07:36,820
it is a beautiful thing.
I'm very happy you've

1063
01:07:36,820 --> 01:07:41,620
seen Jujitsu progress from the time
you were a boy to what it is today.

1064
01:07:41,621 --> 01:07:43,270
I mean it's gotta be an amazing thing.

1065
01:07:43,510 --> 01:07:48,510
An amazing thing also to have taken part
in those first initial invasion moments

1066
01:07:48,790 --> 01:07:50,840
when you guys came and you like this.

1067
01:07:51,010 --> 01:07:53,530
So many of the Gracie in
action videos where uh,

1068
01:07:53,531 --> 01:07:56,590
you know [inaudible] is battling
with the karate guys and you know,

1069
01:07:56,591 --> 01:08:01,000
you're battling with judo guys and the
people that had no idea what Jujitsu was.

1070
01:08:01,001 --> 01:08:01,540
Yes,

1071
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:06,490
I remember very clearly when I saw the
first ultimate fighting championship that

1072
01:08:06,491 --> 01:08:07,480
I saw was number two.

1073
01:08:08,140 --> 01:08:12,400
They had a video tape that was out and
I watched it and I watched hoist win and

1074
01:08:12,401 --> 01:08:14,650
a, I remember thinking to myself, man,

1075
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:18,110
I didn't even know that there was anything
like this out there. I had no idea.

1076
01:08:18,140 --> 01:08:19,730
I had been martial arts my whole life.

1077
01:08:20,030 --> 01:08:21,460
I had no idea that someone
could do something.

1078
01:08:21,750 --> 01:08:23,860
I was doing karate and man,

1079
01:08:23,861 --> 01:08:28,240
when I watched UFC two first cause UFC
one they didn't have any highlights to

1080
01:08:28,241 --> 01:08:29,620
show cause they didn't release it.

1081
01:08:29,670 --> 01:08:32,430
Their idea was they were going to release
two first and then they were going to

1082
01:08:32,431 --> 01:08:33,300
release one for summer.

1083
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:36,160
No. But you have to see one was they
did have paper view for UFC one. Yeah,

1084
01:08:36,180 --> 01:08:40,830
but it wasn't available on VHS. Yes.
And then so once I heard that you have,

1085
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:45,420
see one was real, my friend said, Hey dad,
cause I saw pre before it and I thought,

1086
01:08:45,421 --> 01:08:49,350
oh that's fake. That's like WWF,
that's not real. So I ignored it.

1087
01:08:49,620 --> 01:08:52,500
And then my friend came home one
day, my roommate and said, hey,

1088
01:08:52,850 --> 01:08:56,430
I'm a challenge thing. It's real. Some
Guy Guitar Center told me it was really,

1089
01:08:56,431 --> 01:09:00,000
he said some, some Iranian guy
who was just choking people out,

1090
01:09:00,001 --> 01:09:01,320
he would just grab them by the throat.

1091
01:09:01,410 --> 01:09:05,050
He said Iranian sumo wrestlers
put the split, the split, the two,

1092
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:09,790
my friend, the guy who told me he
didn't see it, he heard it secondhand.

1093
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:10,900
So he said,
yeah,

1094
01:09:10,901 --> 01:09:14,670
some Iranian apparently was grabbing
people by the throat and choking everybody

1095
01:09:14,671 --> 01:09:17,970
out. I said some Iranian I
go did, he didn't fight it.

1096
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:21,750
I was doing karate for six months ago.
It wasn't a karate guy wasn't he goes,

1097
01:09:21,751 --> 01:09:25,650
yeah, he'd be karate be boxes. He beat
it. I go by choking them out like this.

1098
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:29,530
He goes, yeah, that's what they told me.
And I go, so that second one came out,

1099
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:33,300
my friend called up goes, the ultimate
challenge thing is coming out again.

1100
01:09:33,301 --> 01:09:34,530
I go tape it,
tape it.

1101
01:09:34,740 --> 01:09:38,310
So I got home and I watched
it and man I hated hoists,

1102
01:09:38,311 --> 01:09:41,280
Gracie and that opening around cause
I want him to karate guy to win.

1103
01:09:41,281 --> 01:09:43,920
When he bought my Nokia Jr I'm like,
that was my hero.

1104
01:09:44,490 --> 01:09:47,280
I didn't even know who he was, but he did
karate and I thought, okay, he's my hero.

1105
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:50,700
And then, but on the other side was
Pat Smith and I didn't like him.

1106
01:09:51,030 --> 01:09:54,630
And then I didn't like holy there.
But then by the time the finals came,

1107
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:58,740
I fell in love with voice.
By the time the finals hit,

1108
01:09:58,890 --> 01:10:00,060
I was in love with them.
And I go,

1109
01:10:00,061 --> 01:10:03,390
I got to find this because I wrestled
in high school a couple of years and I

1110
01:10:03,391 --> 01:10:07,830
thought either this is primitive wrestling
or it's super advanced wrestling.

1111
01:10:07,831 --> 01:10:10,950
I didn't know what it was. So I
went in, I found John John Machado.

1112
01:10:11,180 --> 01:10:16,030
I went in there and I got choked out
37 times by a purple belt by uh, uh,

1113
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:17,340
Dave Meyer,
Dave Marsh.

1114
01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:22,950
And I remember thinking one day I'm going
to be able to do this with someone who

1115
01:10:22,951 --> 01:10:23,850
just walked in.
I was,

1116
01:10:23,851 --> 01:10:28,450
so from that point on I was
obsessed with this is okay,

1117
01:10:28,530 --> 01:10:30,120
like a changing life experience.

1118
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:33,260
What was it like for you to be there too?

1119
01:10:33,261 --> 01:10:36,340
Did Not Compete and knowing that
you are better than your brother.

1120
01:10:36,380 --> 01:10:38,990
There's all this talk about
why you didn't compete

1121
01:10:39,380 --> 01:10:43,620
in the UFC.
When I come here to support harden and,

1122
01:10:43,621 --> 01:10:48,440
and the cause of uh,
being like spreading the art.

1123
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:53,720
And then one point I was hoarding
soldiers two to four, whatever.

1124
01:10:54,740 --> 01:10:56,240
And um,

1125
01:10:57,010 --> 01:11:02,010
and in another point I decided to
follow my own pet and of course keeping

1126
01:11:03,230 --> 01:11:06,020
keeping the alliance but
going into my own direction

1127
01:11:07,580 --> 01:11:12,560
and then hot and call me and ask me
to train hoists. I didn't know why.

1128
01:11:12,561 --> 01:11:15,450
And he said, then he said, oh, I blaming
should do some events. I said, okay,

1129
01:11:15,451 --> 01:11:20,400
let's do it. So I was his coach
for the first and second event.

1130
01:11:21,390 --> 01:11:26,390
And then somebody asked me through
Eric Paulson and a assistant of,

1131
01:11:28,411 --> 01:11:33,310
uh, of, uh, Daniel Santo, ut Nakamura was

1132
01:11:34,950 --> 01:11:39,030
shorter. Yes. So He's send me
invitation to participate, have a chart.

1133
01:11:39,090 --> 01:11:41,280
I showed top competition,
so,

1134
01:11:41,281 --> 01:11:44,850
and then they send me a tape to
see what the rules are about.

1135
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:47,850
And I didn't like the rules,
but I like the locks.

1136
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:51,870
So I started training the locks and I
said, no man, this is, I mean there's no,

1137
01:11:52,170 --> 01:11:53,070
I don't like it.
So,

1138
01:11:53,071 --> 01:11:57,330
and then we start to immediately
say I don't want to do.

1139
01:11:57,510 --> 01:11:58,920
And then my ex wife,

1140
01:11:59,910 --> 01:12:03,390
much more calm statue negotiate
with the guys in stature say by it.

1141
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:04,231
If we changed the rule.

1142
01:12:04,231 --> 01:12:09,231
So was kind of talk and talk
and eventually they decide
to change the rules for

1143
01:12:10,111 --> 01:12:13,830
a new open rules like in DNA advice,
the way supposed to be the rule.

1144
01:12:13,831 --> 01:12:16,620
So we create the new night,
Eh Valley to the 94.

1145
01:12:17,790 --> 01:12:20,400
And then when I signed the,

1146
01:12:20,580 --> 01:12:24,570
I mean when I about to sign the contract
harder and call me and said, Hixon,

1147
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:27,660
why are you doing? And said, yeah man, I'd
be invited to fight in Japan. Said, no,

1148
01:12:27,661 --> 01:12:32,610
you should not go because this goes
against the family. UFC is our game.

1149
01:12:32,790 --> 01:12:36,720
We should be in support the family and
stay here as high school coach. I said,

1150
01:12:36,721 --> 01:12:37,021
man,

1151
01:12:37,021 --> 01:12:42,021
that's not exactly what I
vision for myself because I
mean I'm here being coach.

1152
01:12:42,571 --> 01:12:46,350
I get an one penny you,
you put a lot of dollars in your pocket,

1153
01:12:46,351 --> 01:12:48,210
you give me nothing.
I'm in.

1154
01:12:48,690 --> 01:12:52,140
You give me some money too for me to
sit on the bench. We are in business.

1155
01:12:52,141 --> 01:12:55,200
But if you give me a knife in the
guys off of me, a lot of money to go.

1156
01:12:55,860 --> 01:12:58,950
You don't even have it. You gave me,
what did they offer you just gave them,

1157
01:12:58,951 --> 01:13:02,480
she'd given me some, he said, no, no,
he should do for the love of the Fetzer.

1158
01:13:02,490 --> 01:13:02,941
Yeah Man,

1159
01:13:02,941 --> 01:13:06,720
I love you guys but you love me and you'll
give me enough in how I going to love

1160
01:13:06,730 --> 01:13:08,660
you. I mean, so I,

1161
01:13:08,661 --> 01:13:13,661
I went to Japan and dealing my think
and stretch winning there and uh,

1162
01:13:13,741 --> 01:13:18,590
and then I get my, my, my
direction towards Japan, which
is, was very good for me.

1163
01:13:19,470 --> 01:13:24,090
The community there. The location,
the culture there. It was, was very,

1164
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:27,630
I mean I feel like home and uh,

1165
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:31,710
that's pretty much where I direct myself,
my career,

1166
01:13:31,711 --> 01:13:34,030
my end of my career to Japan and um,

1167
01:13:34,950 --> 01:13:37,920
but now crones back to see
what's going to happen.

1168
01:13:38,340 --> 01:13:42,450
So were you worried at all with
voice doing the UFC? Did you,

1169
01:13:42,660 --> 01:13:45,390
did you think, cause he was the
youngest one of the brothers riding him,

1170
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:50,730
he didn't compete as much in like are
you worried at all that maybe it was yes,

1171
01:13:50,731 --> 01:13:51,900
but the idea,

1172
01:13:51,930 --> 01:13:55,650
the primary idea of high single in
is because he was not the best one,

1173
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:59,430
but he was, something is going to be a
good task for him is a good, you know,

1174
01:13:59,431 --> 01:14:01,170
to break the ice and stuff but,

1175
01:14:01,860 --> 01:14:06,840
but not exactly if something happened
is always a backup you the backup. Yes.

1176
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:11,140
So I was there to just jump in in case
if someone beat Hoy's you would have

1177
01:14:11,141 --> 01:14:12,230
jumped into the EOC,

1178
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:17,200
the chemo incident, but
that after that, after that,

1179
01:14:17,201 --> 01:14:19,790
that was already engaged in
Japan. I was already, yes.

1180
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:24,440
I you had a contract with them over there.
Yeah. Not for many fights. I never did,

1181
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:27,940
did many fights, contract, uh,
many, many fights in one contract.

1182
01:14:27,941 --> 01:14:32,890
But I felt like hardened create
a very awkward situation,

1183
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:35,830
you know, and uh, and uh,

1184
01:14:35,860 --> 01:14:40,120
was a kind of little d division,
you know,

1185
01:14:40,121 --> 01:14:44,680
so I was not appealing to go there and
show my support your voice and be there

1186
01:14:44,681 --> 01:14:48,040
just so al loud to him
to have his own destiny.

1187
01:14:48,390 --> 01:14:52,410
There was also the talk that voice
was a slender guy who was younger.

1188
01:14:52,411 --> 01:14:54,650
He wasn't as intimidating
as you and that it,

1189
01:14:54,690 --> 01:14:59,070
it sort of accentuated the idea of Jujitsu
due to his technique based where it's,

1190
01:14:59,071 --> 01:15:00,960
you're, you're a scary
guy, you're scary guy now,

1191
01:15:00,961 --> 01:15:05,050
but you were really scary guy then you're
the only, you were the school yoke,

1192
01:15:05,750 --> 01:15:08,810
Gracie one 85. Right? Something like that.

1193
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:10,220
Yeah. It depends. I, yeah,

1194
01:15:10,230 --> 01:15:14,250
I start Zulu was like I have 74 kilos,

1195
01:15:15,390 --> 01:15:20,190
74 killers of maybe one 80, one 80.
Okay. Maybe, maybe a little less.

1196
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:21,750
And then, uh, my,

1197
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:26,660
my last fight in Japan I did with Nike.
Yes.

1198
01:15:26,670 --> 01:15:31,530
I was one a 95. Nice. Cause
he was a guest for two 20.

1199
01:15:31,531 --> 01:15:35,400
Right? Yeah. Nike for Nike should 30.
Should they do something and then, uh,

1200
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:40,800
you know, I was making a
preparation to go heavier than this,

1201
01:15:40,801 --> 01:15:45,630
sometimes even 208 and then
Korea cut down for the,

1202
01:15:45,690 --> 01:15:46,830
to get my best shape.

1203
01:15:47,070 --> 01:15:51,110
When we spoke,
it was a 2000 and when we had dinner,

1204
01:15:51,130 --> 01:15:53,750
was it 2005 or something like
that? Somewhere around there. Sure.

1205
01:15:53,751 --> 01:15:58,620
Yet you were still thinking about fighting
the higher level guys?

1206
01:15:58,650 --> 01:16:01,110
Yes. Yes. But none of
that ever materialized?

1207
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:05,890
Never. Yes. Because, um, I never have the,

1208
01:16:06,340 --> 01:16:10,300
after my,
my son departure on 2000,

1209
01:16:10,301 --> 01:16:14,380
I was about to make the best contract
of my life was I just finished with,

1210
01:16:14,381 --> 01:16:18,770
for Nike and I see what proposal meet
on their proposal to fight Sakura,

1211
01:16:18,771 --> 01:16:23,410
but he was still on the top.
And then, uh, my son departure,

1212
01:16:23,411 --> 01:16:27,850
I have to have like a moment for
the family and regroup as a whole.

1213
01:16:28,060 --> 01:16:30,450
By departure. Your son passed
away. He passed away. Yes.

1214
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:33,130
So was a moment I could,

1215
01:16:33,131 --> 01:16:37,630
I could escape by doing a fight. Say,
okay, I want to focus on the fight,

1216
01:16:38,140 --> 01:16:43,140
but I felt like my family will be
completely unprotected and unsupported.

1217
01:16:43,331 --> 01:16:46,990
So I said, no, I don't care
about the fight I will be.

1218
01:16:47,290 --> 01:16:51,490
So I spent about two years to to make
the whole family feels good again and we

1219
01:16:51,491 --> 01:16:55,390
all regain strength. And,
and and happened is again.

1220
01:16:55,391 --> 01:16:58,900
So after that they start to,
to get another,

1221
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:00,850
get a free agent for a couple of years.

1222
01:17:01,420 --> 01:17:06,310
We tried to make something close to
what I have, but the, the, the, the,

1223
01:17:06,311 --> 01:17:09,100
the whole business in itself in Japan,

1224
01:17:09,140 --> 01:17:12,860
the fact Sec Rabba last for four
Vandelay and things like that,

1225
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:17,450
diminish that kind of huge
purse. And then I felt like, no,

1226
01:17:17,451 --> 01:17:20,240
I just want to fight if he's,
if he's that much.

1227
01:17:20,660 --> 01:17:24,560
So I to be very resistance about
my next fight, some opportunities.

1228
01:17:24,561 --> 01:17:26,360
But I kind of push away.

1229
01:17:27,260 --> 01:17:32,090
And to the point on 2008 I was already
moved back to Brazil for a while.

1230
01:17:33,620 --> 01:17:34,670
A guy from Texas,

1231
01:17:34,671 --> 01:17:38,600
even for items that you compete in a
new event and pull me to fight feather.

1232
01:17:39,590 --> 01:17:42,800
And a,
I was looking for that,

1233
01:17:42,830 --> 01:17:47,830
but I was have a little injury on my hip
and on two way I'd be able to feel good

1234
01:17:48,711 --> 01:17:50,360
to train me.
I could not sign.

1235
01:17:51,260 --> 01:17:55,340
And because he has a deadline in
terms of promotion and search,

1236
01:17:55,880 --> 01:18:00,880
I could not sign without having a hundred
percent confidence because if I sign,

1237
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:05,720
I will fight. I'm not going to and I don't
have the time I want to get. So I said,

1238
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:10,430
you know what? I don't want it. And in
my heart I went to the beach and said,

1239
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:13,820
thank you God for everything I have.
I'm out.

1240
01:18:13,970 --> 01:18:17,690
So I stopped competing,
not exactly the way I want,

1241
01:18:18,290 --> 01:18:23,290
but I felt like I have to respect God's
decision and I just don't want to just

1242
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:28,100
dip a deicing my life for the
money, you know, for. Okay.

1243
01:18:28,101 --> 01:18:31,640
The guy pulled me mine,
I go there and so I feel like I have to,

1244
01:18:31,641 --> 01:18:35,840
butcher represents Jujitsu.
Either I go 100% or you know,

1245
01:18:36,170 --> 01:18:39,080
I hope somebody else got me and then
I'll get to see what ground does

1246
01:18:41,350 --> 01:18:45,320
all the great fighters that you saw
during that time from the time well hoists

1247
01:18:45,321 --> 01:18:47,150
entered the UFC till the
time that you retired,

1248
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:52,360
the guys like Mark Coleman and boss
route and fade or were there any that you

1249
01:18:52,881 --> 01:18:57,050
really wish that you could have had an
opportunity to match up against? Um,

1250
01:18:57,080 --> 01:19:00,740
I always visualizing myself
against the number one, you know,

1251
01:19:00,741 --> 01:19:05,180
I could not even think about.
So one point,

1252
01:19:05,181 --> 01:19:10,130
it was Coleman, you, the point was,
you know, uh, I mean you name it,

1253
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:13,350
the champions and then
feather get the rise in.

1254
01:19:13,351 --> 01:19:17,840
That makes it like a big expression.
So I could not think and about other guy.

1255
01:19:18,180 --> 01:19:21,620
True to represent your shit. So, you
know, I have all this revision that,

1256
01:19:22,370 --> 01:19:24,470
but the set of rules are different.
You know,

1257
01:19:24,471 --> 01:19:28,820
at the time we could express technique
with more because we have time.

1258
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:34,460
You know, I never, somebody asks me, Oh
yeah, you have only few fights in MMA.

1259
01:19:34,461 --> 01:19:36,170
I said, no, I never fought them in me.

1260
01:19:36,770 --> 01:19:40,850
I always fought volley too though
because MMA is a different animal.

1261
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:42,740
You go there for three rounds,

1262
01:19:42,741 --> 01:19:46,160
five minutes is better to
have offensive techniques.

1263
01:19:46,161 --> 01:19:50,150
Then defensive techniques that the defense
not going to do good for you is going

1264
01:19:50,151 --> 01:19:54,060
to do good if you have at least one
round, 10 minutes. And then another.

1265
01:19:54,530 --> 01:19:56,560
So if you have like my fights arise,

1266
01:19:56,660 --> 01:20:00,980
endless rounds of 50 minutes is
endless rounds of five minutes. So,

1267
01:20:01,130 --> 01:20:06,050
and that way you can prepare yourself
for a different strategy. You know,

1268
01:20:06,051 --> 01:20:11,051
you have to follow the movements and you
cannot just go all the way empty or gas

1269
01:20:12,181 --> 01:20:15,720
and then fuel up in empty
again because you know,

1270
01:20:15,990 --> 01:20:18,780
if you amped your gas and the wrong time,
you in trouble.

1271
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:24,500
So all the technique in stretching or
guess and be calm and finding comfortable

1272
01:20:24,901 --> 01:20:27,270
positions,
those are the street right now.

1273
01:20:27,271 --> 01:20:29,940
Now it's becomes a very
stream of very physical.

1274
01:20:30,210 --> 01:20:32,280
You see athletes in the same way division,

1275
01:20:32,281 --> 01:20:35,640
but a guy who fights in
the one 55 walks around,

1276
01:20:35,641 --> 01:20:38,160
we find 81 85 you know,

1277
01:20:38,161 --> 01:20:42,180
so the technology on the
sport today is a huge thing.

1278
01:20:42,210 --> 01:20:46,860
The physicality. That's why taking
any techniques is only a piece of it.

1279
01:20:47,460 --> 01:20:51,420
You know what chrome does today is
not only training Jujitsu and become

1280
01:20:51,421 --> 01:20:55,830
comfortable in the skills he trained
like a dog and all the elements he can do

1281
01:20:56,280 --> 01:21:01,280
to become a cleric and
explosive and physical and
then going to lost weight like

1282
01:21:02,881 --> 01:21:07,881
everybody else plus the technique which
I feel and one point we will be the edge

1283
01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:10,500
he needs to,
to make the difference.

1284
01:21:10,501 --> 01:21:14,670
So do you think there's something missing
in today's mixed martial arts that, um,

1285
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:17,610
that the original Jujitsu
sort of expressed this,

1286
01:21:17,611 --> 01:21:22,080
this idea of having an open round,
having a no limit fight? Is the,

1287
01:21:22,090 --> 01:21:24,510
is there a room for that tonight,
do you think? Or do you think we're,

1288
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:28,620
we're hampered by this idea of a three
hour paper view window or two hour

1289
01:21:28,621 --> 01:21:31,530
television window? It's
funny because, you know,

1290
01:21:31,531 --> 01:21:35,580
the other day I got caught watching,
I fought our match in tennis,

1291
01:21:36,570 --> 01:21:41,240
you know, it was a great match was
along and the still going one more says,

1292
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:44,860
oh man. And you'll see, I have no
idea they were that long that long.

1293
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:50,560
Your Palm Beach and the Dow and the s I
think French Open last year I was five

1294
01:21:50,701 --> 01:21:53,730
hours, five hours, five hours nonstop man.

1295
01:21:53,790 --> 01:21:58,050
And they break and start again.
And the advantage was unbelievable,

1296
01:21:58,650 --> 01:22:01,110
you know?
So if you're passionate about tennis,

1297
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:06,390
sometimes the game can be like 45
minutes sometimes can be couple of hours

1298
01:22:07,110 --> 01:22:09,000
because you there in the action,
you know?

1299
01:22:09,001 --> 01:22:12,990
So for me when we
talking about engagement,

1300
01:22:13,620 --> 01:22:14,760
we talking about,

1301
01:22:15,450 --> 01:22:20,450
I mean the best one out there and when
I see a fight after 50 minutes because

1302
01:22:22,021 --> 01:22:25,860
somebody punched once or fallen
top or just give him the tro.

1303
01:22:27,180 --> 01:22:30,510
Both guys stand up, they both
design and then the time is over.

1304
01:22:30,511 --> 01:22:33,060
Who wins the fight in my opinion,

1305
01:22:33,061 --> 01:22:37,170
supposed to be a draw because
how the guy can, can we just,

1306
01:22:37,171 --> 01:22:40,140
because one more point, the guys are
warriors, the guys are willing to go.

1307
01:22:40,470 --> 01:22:45,000
So it's always like halfway to
what's supposed to be, you know,

1308
01:22:45,001 --> 01:22:49,440
because Eh, okay. You have to decide
by points after a few. Okay. So,

1309
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:54,780
I mean, it's hard because, you know,
sometimes I even have the best of it,

1310
01:22:55,260 --> 01:22:59,460
but that's doesn't guarantee if the
fight goes longer, if he's still that,

1311
01:22:59,461 --> 01:23:00,840
because toughness,

1312
01:23:01,050 --> 01:23:04,800
resilience and in heart and technique,

1313
01:23:04,801 --> 01:23:09,460
they all want to pay in one point, going
to be a big, a big situation, you know?

1314
01:23:09,461 --> 01:23:14,190
So it's for me, not the, did the, you,

1315
01:23:14,230 --> 01:23:18,190
the rules today in the UFC
and such doesn't translate.

1316
01:23:18,910 --> 01:23:23,710
The best guy out there translates
the most agile, the most tough.

1317
01:23:24,010 --> 01:23:26,350
The one who get connect first,
you know,

1318
01:23:26,351 --> 01:23:30,280
because sometimes the fight can be
either way. The whoever connects first,

1319
01:23:30,281 --> 01:23:34,810
whoever makes the fruit can win.
So it's kind of hard to a virus.

1320
01:23:34,870 --> 01:23:37,570
But if you put two guys
in the cage and okay man,

1321
01:23:38,830 --> 01:23:41,980
whoever's get out first is the winner.
So,

1322
01:23:42,290 --> 01:23:45,880
and that's a different animal
because you have to be technical,

1323
01:23:45,881 --> 01:23:50,170
you have to be patient, you have
to be. So, you know, I can see,

1324
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:51,970
uh,

1325
01:23:51,970 --> 01:23:56,770
first is the expectation is
all in the how chrome gonna do.

1326
01:23:58,150 --> 01:24:03,150
But if confirms what I believe
can be done eventually,

1327
01:24:04,030 --> 01:24:08,740
I feel like grown will be comfortable
to challenge anyone for a no time limit

1328
01:24:08,741 --> 01:24:12,510
fight. Because I mean I
don't care if he's Velasquez,

1329
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:14,140
I don't care if he's John John's.

1330
01:24:14,980 --> 01:24:19,480
If crown do what he has to do with the
time he has to do, I believe on him.

1331
01:24:20,230 --> 01:24:22,100
Like I believe in myself.
If I have the help,

1332
01:24:22,101 --> 01:24:25,570
should they and the physicality I so I,
I like to have,

1333
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:30,490
I mean I don't see a guy just
because he's winning on the cage,

1334
01:24:30,491 --> 01:24:34,810
he can win me cause they don't see
the opportunities happen on the cage.

1335
01:24:34,840 --> 01:24:36,550
I'm not going to give those opportunities.

1336
01:24:37,210 --> 01:24:40,930
So it's hard to say,
but you know,

1337
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:45,160
the way division doesn't make too much
difference for me if I have the time to,

1338
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:48,790
to, to cook and slow burn.
But if the thing's kind of,

1339
01:24:49,210 --> 01:24:52,840
if even my way division 80 kilos for
example, if I want to fight that guy,

1340
01:24:52,841 --> 01:24:55,330
we've had 95 kilos and make a technology.

1341
01:24:55,570 --> 01:24:59,440
So I going to fight a different monster
in five minutes rounds is almost

1342
01:24:59,441 --> 01:25:00,880
impossible. How are we, I mean,

1343
01:25:01,780 --> 01:25:05,950
so and then that's kind of unbalanced
now based on the stream aspect of the

1344
01:25:05,951 --> 01:25:09,970
sport, the physicality of the sport and
the technique who has to be applied.

1345
01:25:10,030 --> 01:25:12,310
So the difference between
a fight and a match,

1346
01:25:12,311 --> 01:25:15,280
the difference between a fight
in a sport and in a fight,

1347
01:25:15,850 --> 01:25:19,540
they're just two guys going
out each other. And I agree
that there's many, many,

1348
01:25:19,541 --> 01:25:23,440
many fights where a guy when a ten nine
round and another guy when the other 10

1349
01:25:23,460 --> 01:25:25,540
Reiner and then one guy
when the final round,

1350
01:25:25,541 --> 01:25:29,400
maybe tonight a little troll or something,
it's a draw to be.

1351
01:25:29,910 --> 01:25:33,400
It's not done. It's like sex without
an orgasm. Yeah, complete days.

1352
01:25:33,401 --> 01:25:37,570
He's men and normally happens.
I mean sometimes beautiful knockouts,

1353
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:41,680
but sometimes you know, it's just,
you know, a too much strength,

1354
01:25:41,681 --> 01:25:45,040
too much physicality and every time goes
to the flooding I immediately stand up.

1355
01:25:45,070 --> 01:25:47,860
He, because if he knows
if he stay on the ground,

1356
01:25:48,010 --> 01:25:51,730
he's losing time and he's not going to
be able to capitalize because the time is

1357
01:25:51,731 --> 01:25:55,710
not as long as enough and too,
so that's kind of, you know,

1358
01:25:55,720 --> 01:25:57,640
a great area is not a,

1359
01:25:57,641 --> 01:26:01,960
it doesn't have the appeal for
me to see a good, a good match.

1360
01:26:01,990 --> 01:26:05,690
What about when hoist fought Sakuraba
and they had that crazy 90 minute match?

1361
01:26:05,750 --> 01:26:08,180
Yes.
What about that was uh,

1362
01:26:08,300 --> 01:26:10,970
an idea of like having these long,

1363
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:14,840
long matches [inaudible] Jujitsu.
We need time because we don't have,

1364
01:26:14,990 --> 01:26:19,880
I mean we give that vantage off weight,
we give advantage of, you know, whatever.

1365
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:23,900
So let's at least have the time
for us to be becoming strategical.

1366
01:26:24,030 --> 01:26:27,260
But would you have preferred that kind
of a fight to be no rounds though cause

1367
01:26:27,261 --> 01:26:30,050
that fight they broke up into
a series of rounds. Yeah,

1368
01:26:30,051 --> 01:26:34,190
I'm in at that point I felt
like it was a lack of action of,

1369
01:26:34,310 --> 01:26:38,960
I mean hoist supposed to fight better.
I was not on his side.

1370
01:26:39,620 --> 01:26:43,370
And a, I see a pads on on him too
sometimes make little mistakes,

1371
01:26:43,371 --> 01:26:44,750
which when I was there,

1372
01:26:45,950 --> 01:26:50,390
I was focused on making him
few sharp and we find not dad.

1373
01:26:50,391 --> 01:26:54,320
I felt like a little fuzzy.
I had to do it mentally.

1374
01:26:54,530 --> 01:26:59,330
His focus was not. So it's a lot of
different elements for Chu Chu, Chu,

1375
01:26:59,331 --> 01:27:01,820
Chu, Chu, Chu justified, you know,

1376
01:27:01,850 --> 01:27:06,650
because I believe hoist has elements
should beat Sakuraba, you know, and,

1377
01:27:06,651 --> 01:27:11,450
but he didn't, so it was just, he did
the second time. Yeah, the rematch.

1378
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:14,270
Yeah. He found the second time
in a la right. Wasn't that,

1379
01:27:15,390 --> 01:27:19,400
were you there when he fought
him the second time? Did he
match? No. No. Did you, he,

1380
01:27:19,401 --> 01:27:23,600
you know, he beat him, right? Yeah.

1381
01:27:23,610 --> 01:27:28,160
And that's the rematch. We Oh, you
were aware of that, right? No, I'm not.

1382
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:31,920
Oh, okay. Yeah. They had a rematch
and he beat him here in la one. Right.

1383
01:27:31,950 --> 01:27:35,460
It was k one. It was at the
coliseum. That was the first time.

1384
01:27:35,461 --> 01:27:39,510
Brock Lesnar fraud too. Yeah.
Now there's a, a lot of problems.

1385
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:44,840
Jujitsu guys have world class Mundey Al
blackbelt champions have an MMA is they

1386
01:27:46,771 --> 01:27:50,040
get in the cage and it happens.

1387
01:27:50,130 --> 01:27:54,720
I would say it's a big reason why they
ended up getting cut from the UFC as they

1388
01:27:54,721 --> 01:27:56,850
ended up fighting wrestlers.

1389
01:27:56,851 --> 01:28:00,360
Like everyone at the top 10 is
really hard to take down the UFC.

1390
01:28:00,580 --> 01:28:03,900
So did you just a guy will come in and
he's fighting a guy who wrestled his

1391
01:28:03,901 --> 01:28:04,500
whole life.

1392
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:07,470
There's zero chance that he's going
to be able to take down that rest are.

1393
01:28:07,471 --> 01:28:09,540
So He's forced to kickbox right.

1394
01:28:09,541 --> 01:28:14,250
So the wrestlers forcing the kickbox
kickboxing fight because the Jujitsu guy

1395
01:28:14,251 --> 01:28:18,770
can't take down the wrestler.
Do in those situations. Um,

1396
01:28:19,180 --> 01:28:23,250
uh, like, uh, I dunno if you remember
Nogueira when he fought Tim Sylvia,

1397
01:28:23,251 --> 01:28:26,190
the big giant guy,
he could not take Tim Silvia down.

1398
01:28:26,191 --> 01:28:31,191
So he eventually shot Tim Silvia sprawled
a little bit and then Nogueira pulled

1399
01:28:31,351 --> 01:28:33,990
guard. He was on his back. He swept him,

1400
01:28:34,020 --> 01:28:37,080
he got on top and then he choked
him out with the Guillotine.

1401
01:28:37,590 --> 01:28:41,560
So in that situation,
the guard pool saved Nogueira like,

1402
01:28:41,561 --> 01:28:42,900
cause what do you think about it?

1403
01:28:43,050 --> 01:28:48,050
I 100% I 100% confident in the guard
because what I see today in the display of

1404
01:28:51,190 --> 01:28:56,190
great Jujitsu fighters in the
cage is they have the guard,

1405
01:28:56,400 --> 01:29:00,060
but they have a sportive guard. They
don't have a valley to the garden. Yes.

1406
01:29:00,090 --> 01:29:01,830
They not dangerous the bottom.

1407
01:29:02,130 --> 01:29:02,460
Yes.

1408
01:29:02,460 --> 01:29:07,170
So they become technicals from the bottom
against the dangerous ground in pound.

1409
01:29:07,410 --> 01:29:11,490
Yeah. So they get all dead. They're
getting all that these advantage.

1410
01:29:12,330 --> 01:29:15,870
So in my perspective, for example, crown,

1411
01:29:15,930 --> 01:29:19,500
he's been training to deal with
tough wrestler, stuffed boxers,

1412
01:29:19,501 --> 01:29:24,120
but he don't try to apply wrestling
against wrestling because he going to need

1413
01:29:24,121 --> 01:29:29,121
another life to become like a shoots or
like a Matt Hughes or like some other

1414
01:29:30,540 --> 01:29:30,990
tough,

1415
01:29:30,990 --> 01:29:34,590
what is the strategy for chrome when he
fights a rustler that he can't take down,

1416
01:29:34,710 --> 01:29:35,610
he brings to the guard.

1417
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:39,270
So he's so golf bowling has something
that he's thinking about guard his no

1418
01:29:39,271 --> 01:29:40,950
other option on the ground.

1419
01:29:41,490 --> 01:29:45,780
Jujitsu has to be happy on top
in happier on the bottom. Yes.

1420
01:29:45,781 --> 01:29:46,740
People frown upon.

1421
01:29:46,830 --> 01:29:50,220
I'm a big advocate of pulling garden and
they made their fighters that have done

1422
01:29:50,221 --> 01:29:53,490
it. There's a guy named Paul Sass from
England. He pulls guard all the time.

1423
01:29:53,491 --> 01:29:57,270
He's a master of pulling guard. He knows
exactly how to do it. He shoots deep.

1424
01:29:57,330 --> 01:30:00,440
The guy sprawls and as he sprawling,
he pulls guard and he's,

1425
01:30:00,450 --> 01:30:04,620
he puts people in triangles, triangle
victories in a row. Yeah, he,

1426
01:30:04,730 --> 01:30:08,940
but the triangle is risky because once
you know how to defend, like unluck,

1427
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:12,930
you'll becoming available
for granted grounded pounds.

1428
01:30:12,931 --> 01:30:17,931
So if the guy is completely safe on
the not getting caught in the triangle,

1429
01:30:18,750 --> 01:30:21,000
your attempts of techniques,

1430
01:30:21,030 --> 01:30:25,260
I kind of diminishing your capacity
to survive and to defend yourself.

1431
01:30:25,530 --> 01:30:29,760
So you attacking techniques from the
bottom, but he's still on the rich. Yes.

1432
01:30:29,790 --> 01:30:34,140
So the idea of a perfect valley to
the guard is save your distance.

1433
01:30:34,141 --> 01:30:39,090
You don't get pounded by those surprising
elbows like John Kalench over her.

1434
01:30:39,091 --> 01:30:40,440
No, no. You cannot clinch.

1435
01:30:40,650 --> 01:30:43,650
You have chosen in the legs and
you have to heat with the legs.

1436
01:30:44,160 --> 01:30:48,460
So it's always a striking from the bottom.
You know, it doesn't have to be quick.

1437
01:30:48,461 --> 01:30:52,500
So you don't believe that you should
be clenched. And only if the guy,

1438
01:30:52,710 --> 01:30:56,280
if the guy promotes that,
if he wants to space to hit you,

1439
01:30:56,281 --> 01:30:58,500
you need to be comfortable
and hit him back.

1440
01:30:59,310 --> 01:31:04,310
So he's a fight where imagine a 12
year old kid laying down on the ground,

1441
01:31:04,561 --> 01:31:06,360
we feed to you.
If you start,

1442
01:31:06,361 --> 01:31:10,890
you're using the foot is going to be
hard for even you is a big man to reach.

1443
01:31:11,190 --> 01:31:16,050
Yeah. So there's no use of the legs.
People has no clue how to striking,

1444
01:31:16,051 --> 01:31:16,920
how to use.

1445
01:31:17,370 --> 01:31:21,180
I know in UFC has some illegal
heal from the barn and you can,

1446
01:31:21,510 --> 01:31:23,970
but you still can use different strikes.
You know,

1447
01:31:23,971 --> 01:31:28,200
you can even have the distance to survive
and to be completely protected against

1448
01:31:28,201 --> 01:31:31,680
elbows. And, and the issue though
that if someone can disengage,

1449
01:31:31,681 --> 01:31:35,340
if you're on your back and you're trying
to not clench and not hold onto them,

1450
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:38,400
your Jujitsu practitioner, the guy
can just disengage you, haven't they?

1451
01:31:38,460 --> 01:31:42,300
They just stand up. Once it does
engage, he's escaping from the fight.

1452
01:31:42,301 --> 01:31:47,301
I can stand up again and keep
the same process of bleaching.

1453
01:31:47,790 --> 01:31:48,211
So,

1454
01:31:48,211 --> 01:31:53,160
so now crowns in a situation where he's
fighting a wrestler and he can't take

1455
01:31:53,161 --> 01:31:56,640
them down. Then he pulls guard. Yeah.
And then he opens up his legs to kick.

1456
01:31:56,641 --> 01:32:00,010
The guy stands up. Now he's
got to stand up again. Yes. So

1457
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:04,000
they could just keep doing that over
and over again. Like how does he went?

1458
01:32:04,001 --> 01:32:05,590
Chocolate Dell,
who's an expert.

1459
01:32:05,591 --> 01:32:07,930
Stryker as well as the rest of
the very tough to take down,

1460
01:32:07,931 --> 01:32:10,630
but also an expert striker.
When you get that guy to the ground,

1461
01:32:10,780 --> 01:32:14,200
don't you want to optimize
that opportunity as much
as possible and hang onto

1462
01:32:14,201 --> 01:32:15,034
them while you're on the bottom?

1463
01:32:15,060 --> 01:32:17,790
That's depends.
Depends where the way division where,

1464
01:32:17,791 --> 01:32:19,380
what is the weight distribution is.

1465
01:32:19,590 --> 01:32:23,610
I have to obey the sense if he's on me,

1466
01:32:23,970 --> 01:32:28,590
I lose sweep him. I will be on his
back in no time. If he's away from me.

1467
01:32:28,591 --> 01:32:32,830
If he wants you looking for distance, I
have to understand that and respect that.

1468
01:32:32,831 --> 01:32:37,590
Then protect myself to don't get founded,
you know? And and that process of,

1469
01:32:37,591 --> 01:32:40,530
okay, I don't want to engage. He's
moving back and then you stand up.

1470
01:32:40,770 --> 01:32:42,960
And all of this process.
A lot of things happen.

1471
01:32:43,620 --> 01:32:48,620
What is important for as Jujitsu fighter
is know everything about the anti game

1472
01:32:51,090 --> 01:32:55,050
off the Stryker. I don't make grown, I
don't try to make crone a good striker.

1473
01:32:55,620 --> 01:32:58,230
I want to make him
comfortable to in and out.

1474
01:32:58,470 --> 01:33:02,460
I want to make very comfortable to
fight inside with knees and elbows,

1475
01:33:03,030 --> 01:33:06,210
you know, be, be dangerous inside,

1476
01:33:06,750 --> 01:33:11,750
be comfortable on top and
be very comfortable in the
bottle and the action man.

1477
01:33:13,070 --> 01:33:14,430
It because it's a lot of,

1478
01:33:14,490 --> 01:33:19,110
even though in those five
minutes fight is a lot of action.

1479
01:33:19,140 --> 01:33:22,640
I mean there's a lot of
stalling is a lot of studies,

1480
01:33:22,650 --> 01:33:26,040
a lot of disengage. I mean
they engage in it, it'll be,

1481
01:33:26,041 --> 01:33:29,280
and then they separate and okay now
let's think, let's see who's fight.

1482
01:33:29,670 --> 01:33:33,590
It's hard to see a guy who's just
goes like, and I feel like the,

1483
01:33:33,591 --> 01:33:34,950
the great uh,

1484
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:38,820
element to give it to strategy of growth
is going to keep a prat consistent

1485
01:33:38,821 --> 01:33:39,654
pressure.

1486
01:33:39,780 --> 01:33:44,780
That means he's not going to be studying
or in a distance where the striker

1487
01:33:45,480 --> 01:33:49,790
fuels, like waiting is going
to be the two out or chew in.

1488
01:33:50,160 --> 01:33:54,630
And then once it's in, let's fight the
fight, let's fight like a, you know,

1489
01:33:54,750 --> 01:33:58,500
elbows, whatever. And then immediately
the fight goes to the ground,

1490
01:33:58,980 --> 01:34:01,710
no matter if it's one
on top or on the bottom.

1491
01:34:01,711 --> 01:34:04,620
And then the consistence of this,

1492
01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:07,840
I feel like opportunities will rise.

1493
01:34:08,230 --> 01:34:12,400
Do you watch MMA a lot to this? Did
you watch Bj Penn's last fight? Yes,

1494
01:34:12,810 --> 01:34:16,050
doubt that. If I was very sad
to me, very sad to watch. Um,

1495
01:34:16,150 --> 01:34:19,960
and I was very frustrated
watching it as a Bj Penn Fan,

1496
01:34:20,060 --> 01:34:22,330
as a Frankie Edgar Fan,
I thought it was a great performance.

1497
01:34:22,690 --> 01:34:27,430
But one of the things that frustrates me
about Bj is that he very rarely attacks

1498
01:34:27,490 --> 01:34:29,770
from his back.
When he's on the bottom,

1499
01:34:29,890 --> 01:34:32,950
he puts feed on the hips and
he just kind of holds on.

1500
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:37,490
Yes, maybe he was not exactly, I dunno.

1501
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:41,690
I mean he did the poor, a poor, poor
game from the bottom and my perspective,

1502
01:34:41,691 --> 01:34:46,490
he supposed to have a little
more um, elements, Choo, Choo,

1503
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:51,320
Choo, Choo. Not preserve his integrity
but also to attack, you know,

1504
01:34:51,680 --> 01:34:54,200
and I don't fell that
then I feel like I'm in,

1505
01:34:54,410 --> 01:34:56,210
he's just not doing what he's supposed to.

1506
01:34:56,240 --> 01:34:59,600
Eddie, we talked that, yeah. That sort of
frustrated you a little bit too, right?

1507
01:35:00,380 --> 01:35:04,340
Yes. I don't know if you're aware of
the six and, but I'm, I'm obsessed with,

1508
01:35:04,610 --> 01:35:09,560
I've been obsessed with developing the
best guard for when they're striking,

1509
01:35:09,620 --> 01:35:14,620
I analyze it and to death and
I'm the guard that I comprised.

1510
01:35:15,031 --> 01:35:19,970
I put elements from, you know, my students
helped me. Nina Schembri helped me.

1511
01:35:20,060 --> 01:35:22,730
So I put all these elements together,

1512
01:35:22,731 --> 01:35:27,530
but it all started off when I was on
this quest to put together the ultimate

1513
01:35:27,531 --> 01:35:30,920
guard for MMA because I was seeing too
many guys just get beat up in the garden.

1514
01:35:30,921 --> 01:35:34,430
I thought we got to like, I felt like
you had like the effectiveness is gone.

1515
01:35:34,431 --> 01:35:37,760
What is the problem? Why are people
getting pounded in the guard?

1516
01:35:37,761 --> 01:35:41,590
We have to change this. So the first
thing I studied was you and Henzel.

1517
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:44,380
This was back in the nineties
I go, okay, well I'm going to,

1518
01:35:44,390 --> 01:35:48,260
I'm going to attempt to
improve the guard in MMA.

1519
01:35:48,380 --> 01:35:51,260
So I looked at you and I looked
at him Zanga what are they doing?

1520
01:35:51,470 --> 01:35:55,340
They're in full guard and
their whole holding the over
hook to prevent the punch.

1521
01:35:55,341 --> 01:35:57,740
Like anybody tried to punch in
the guard with the right arm,

1522
01:35:57,800 --> 01:36:00,830
you would over hook it. And
when headbutts were legal, your,

1523
01:36:01,190 --> 01:36:05,090
your left hand was like this. You were
like this protecting the head bud.

1524
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:06,710
But then when they met
head ahead of what's legal,

1525
01:36:06,711 --> 01:36:07,610
you don't have to do this no more.

1526
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:11,840
So you could hold the head now and now
in this position with the overlook,

1527
01:36:11,930 --> 01:36:14,390
you have full guard, you're holding
the head. There's a clinch there.

1528
01:36:14,750 --> 01:36:19,370
So to me as trying to be a Jujitsu
scientist trying to, I'm like,

1529
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:23,690
if that, that is the
stance in MMA, that's it.

1530
01:36:23,690 --> 01:36:26,570
You enhance or that's what you guys are
doing it. You look at all the old fights,

1531
01:36:26,690 --> 01:36:29,060
full guard stopped the
paunch hold the head.

1532
01:36:29,210 --> 01:36:33,860
And so to me that was the
starting point. Yes, I agree.

1533
01:36:34,900 --> 01:36:39,320
And uh, but Jujitsu is a, is an animal
whose never stopped to grow. Yes.

1534
01:36:40,040 --> 01:36:45,040
And one day I was comfortably
in California watching a
fight in Brazil and then

1535
01:36:46,491 --> 01:36:51,491
I saw like I eight men tournament where
fabulous Janelle was fighting mark care

1536
01:36:52,291 --> 01:36:54,920
in my care was the first
time he'd show up in the end.

1537
01:36:54,921 --> 01:36:59,880
The first time I saw him fighting.
That was his first tournament. Yes.

1538
01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:04,910
So, and he went to the finals with
fibro and I knew Fabul I train with him.

1539
01:37:04,911 --> 01:37:08,780
He's a brother, you know, we,
and I saw what he did with fiber.

1540
01:37:08,781 --> 01:37:13,010
You like stay on thought ground and
pound and smashing the elbow on his fee

1541
01:37:13,050 --> 01:37:18,050
after five years to forgetting to his
arm and was like next day he was all your

1542
01:37:19,151 --> 01:37:22,550
flame arm and you go into the,
the airplane like this,

1543
01:37:22,551 --> 01:37:26,630
you made almost lose the arm because
then they give antibiotic. We're never,

1544
01:37:26,631 --> 01:37:27,464
but anyway,

1545
01:37:27,860 --> 01:37:32,120
after I saw that fight and
the in the lack of options,

1546
01:37:32,121 --> 01:37:35,930
fiber was there. Next Day
in the morning, I wake up,

1547
01:37:35,931 --> 01:37:40,360
I call my son Hawks and he's down
to 11 years old, about hundred,

1548
01:37:40,370 --> 01:37:42,010
10 pounds. He said, hug.

1549
01:37:42,011 --> 01:37:45,440
So I'm coming here and then I went to
the garage on my mats, said lay down,

1550
01:37:46,580 --> 01:37:50,960
put him, lay down. And I
tried to represent the same
position because the, the,

1551
01:37:50,970 --> 01:37:51,701
the different,

1552
01:37:51,701 --> 01:37:55,860
the size weights does almost the same
from fiber would yell to kid, then me

1553
01:37:56,050 --> 01:37:57,270
for four Alexson.

1554
01:37:58,350 --> 01:38:03,350
So I kind of immediately put him in the
fibers position and I put myself in and,

1555
01:38:03,781 --> 01:38:06,740
and uh,
and uh,

1556
01:38:07,140 --> 01:38:09,540
mark your position and then I start,

1557
01:38:09,541 --> 01:38:13,230
you will analyze his was insect
crow Huxson do this, do that,

1558
01:38:13,410 --> 01:38:16,500
move a little more this way. So
it was not, we're not a fighting,

1559
01:38:16,501 --> 01:38:21,501
but I tried to find him a position for
him to be comfortable and I spent about

1560
01:38:22,831 --> 01:38:27,831
45 and 50 minutes searching is studying
with him because I liked that kind of

1561
01:38:28,111 --> 01:38:29,460
unproportional size.

1562
01:38:31,110 --> 01:38:34,560
When I finish that,
that section

1563
01:38:36,420 --> 01:38:41,040
and totally like I reinvent myself in
terms of what are you going to do if I

1564
01:38:41,041 --> 01:38:44,850
have to fight my catch your model
because I was satisfied with the angles.

1565
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:49,860
I could put Harkin in our that
you resist my leverage, my angles,

1566
01:38:50,340 --> 01:38:53,460
what exactly I saw in the day before.

1567
01:38:54,330 --> 01:38:57,270
So that means from one day to a neither.

1568
01:38:57,300 --> 01:39:00,480
I kind of focus myself in fix it.

1569
01:39:00,481 --> 01:39:04,470
The problem I saw with fabulous and
at that point I felt like, okay,

1570
01:39:04,471 --> 01:39:08,010
I'm fixed now I'm ready to fight for new
wears out your model and what does this,

1571
01:39:08,100 --> 01:39:11,430
what is the stance? What
did you change? I could not,

1572
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:15,300
I could not have him go hawks and
could not have him in control.

1573
01:39:15,930 --> 01:39:17,490
He has to create distance.

1574
01:39:18,180 --> 01:39:23,180
He has true how shen across the belly
not he has to use defeat more properly on

1575
01:39:25,171 --> 01:39:27,870
the hips. Yes, he has to
use the knee on the chest.

1576
01:39:27,871 --> 01:39:31,530
Sometimes he has to use the element of,

1577
01:39:31,950 --> 01:39:34,980
of as I approach to
getting better position,

1578
01:39:35,070 --> 01:39:38,970
the bottom guy has to heat
because if you don't we strike.

1579
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,430
You don't make the guy kind of go back.

1580
01:39:42,060 --> 01:39:45,150
So he's a combination between fighting

1581
01:39:46,770 --> 01:39:51,060
in Brazil we have two different names
when you bra and when you fight.

1582
01:39:51,060 --> 01:39:55,280
Fight is more like a sportive
and when you Brah you like, uh,

1583
01:39:55,380 --> 01:39:59,730
just do it whenever.
So technically speaking,

1584
01:40:00,060 --> 01:40:02,760
when somebody wants to
add back me as a brawler,

1585
01:40:03,030 --> 01:40:05,970
I don't want to fight a broad back.

1586
01:40:06,240 --> 01:40:10,960
I want to be technical and survive and
be comfortable and soon his statutes say

1587
01:40:10,961 --> 01:40:15,150
full, I cannot have anything here. Let me
be taking code to see if I can advance.

1588
01:40:15,330 --> 01:40:18,480
And that's the time I will blow
against him and make him get confused.

1589
01:40:18,481 --> 01:40:22,890
So I have to change your strategies as
he come. If he come in to be a fighter,

1590
01:40:23,010 --> 01:40:26,940
I will be aggressive.
I'd be mean if he come in to be a brawler,

1591
01:40:27,060 --> 01:40:29,400
I will be technical and
I will be comfortable.

1592
01:40:30,060 --> 01:40:35,060
So that kind of sense of change gives
up perspective for the the bottom guy,

1593
01:40:35,641 --> 01:40:39,060
it should be on on edge, which
will be on top of the, the office.

1594
01:40:39,090 --> 01:40:41,120
Now Mark Kerr in that fight
that you're talking about,

1595
01:40:41,130 --> 01:40:43,140
fibers or show headbutts were legal.

1596
01:40:43,141 --> 01:40:47,610
So that was a huge part of how he
was getting busted up with headbutts.

1597
01:40:47,850 --> 01:40:51,280
But since then headbutts
it becoming legal, uh,

1598
01:40:52,950 --> 01:40:57,950
we're the headbutts a big reason you
decided to change your guard stamp also,

1599
01:40:58,061 --> 01:41:02,230
but the elbows in the reach and the
way the guy position himself, you know,

1600
01:41:02,410 --> 01:41:05,920
and the way, uh, fiber was
always with the leg cross.

1601
01:41:06,490 --> 01:41:10,540
He was falling exactly what he
learned and what he saw. And he,

1602
01:41:10,780 --> 01:41:12,580
he could not have the time to improvise.

1603
01:41:12,581 --> 01:41:16,770
Nobody expect Mark Caribbean
tough as he was then.

1604
01:41:17,110 --> 01:41:21,280
The monsters just happened in front of
Fabio and he has to deal with whatever he

1605
01:41:21,390 --> 01:41:24,430
didn't know. He was crying and throwing
up in the locker room before that. Fine.

1606
01:41:24,460 --> 01:41:28,750
Yeah, he is. He was emotional.
Yes. Very nervous. And I mean,

1607
01:41:28,780 --> 01:41:31,620
shows in the little documentary he did.
He always have,

1608
01:41:33,370 --> 01:41:37,420
but then in one point he's a potential.
He was, the men should be beating.

1609
01:41:37,421 --> 01:41:41,410
He was like, he was enormous.
Yes. And, uh, you know, as a fan,

1610
01:41:41,411 --> 01:41:44,770
as a fan of Jujitsu and a fan of mixed
martial arts and valley to dope, man,

1611
01:41:44,771 --> 01:41:48,130
I would just wish you had had those
opportunities to face those guys.

1612
01:41:48,131 --> 01:41:49,870
I would have loved to have seen any true,

1613
01:41:50,280 --> 01:41:53,730
ah, now I'm what I, like I said,

1614
01:41:54,040 --> 01:41:58,090
when I was trying to figure out the
best MMA guard, I was looking at you,

1615
01:41:58,091 --> 01:42:00,790
I was looking at Hixson
grabbing the overlook and,

1616
01:42:00,791 --> 01:42:04,060
but the one thing I knew is if
that's the defensive posture,

1617
01:42:04,061 --> 01:42:06,070
this is what I was thinking.
I didn't know you changed it up.

1618
01:42:06,071 --> 01:42:09,460
But at that point I thought that was it.
That's the defensive posture.

1619
01:42:09,461 --> 01:42:14,050
Someone was in your guard, you have to
defend first. So I thought, well okay,

1620
01:42:14,440 --> 01:42:19,390
that has to be the stance. So we have
to create or offense from that stance.

1621
01:42:19,391 --> 01:42:23,380
So the defense is first and do we have
off fence from the overheard and my

1622
01:42:23,381 --> 01:42:24,760
instructor John Jacques Machado,

1623
01:42:24,761 --> 01:42:29,761
and he is one of the only guys I know
of out of all the top Jujitsu guys that

1624
01:42:30,580 --> 01:42:34,570
his whole game is based on the over Hook
and not grabbing the sleeves because

1625
01:42:34,571 --> 01:42:38,050
his left hand, he was born without
fingers. So no matter what,

1626
01:42:38,051 --> 01:42:39,700
whether it was Geeky or no geek,

1627
01:42:39,820 --> 01:42:43,600
he needed that over hook cause
he couldn't control the sleeves.

1628
01:42:43,810 --> 01:42:47,830
So his overall game was translated
to a students, me included.

1629
01:42:47,831 --> 01:42:52,030
So I was always looking for the ovary
because John Jack was my master and,

1630
01:42:52,300 --> 01:42:55,540
and then when,
when he got invited to Abu Dhabi,

1631
01:42:56,020 --> 01:42:58,030
before he went to Abu Dhabi,

1632
01:42:58,031 --> 01:43:00,850
there was a lot of legends there that a
lot of Jujitsu legends that were going

1633
01:43:00,851 --> 01:43:04,000
to Abu Dhabi and without the gay,
there was no offense,

1634
01:43:04,001 --> 01:43:05,230
there was a lot of boring matches.

1635
01:43:05,231 --> 01:43:10,231
But John Jack shows up and he
just rises above everybody.

1636
01:43:11,530 --> 01:43:15,760
If you watch what John Jack did in Abu
Dhabi, he didn't change his left arm,

1637
01:43:15,761 --> 01:43:18,700
didn't change without a
gears. I know, gee, I'm still
going to grab that over Hook.

1638
01:43:18,701 --> 01:43:19,420
Anyways.

1639
01:43:19,420 --> 01:43:23,050
Everybody else was lost because they were
used to their fighting stance or guard

1640
01:43:23,051 --> 01:43:25,870
fighting. Sam's was
sleeve color, color sleep.

1641
01:43:25,990 --> 01:43:28,900
So without the Geeta had to change
everything and they weren't used to it.

1642
01:43:28,901 --> 01:43:33,070
They didn't have any offense from there.
So to me, I took what you and Hanzo,

1643
01:43:33,071 --> 01:43:34,780
oh we're doing what the
overlook and the controlling,

1644
01:43:34,990 --> 01:43:38,350
but that's how John Jog fights with
the over hook. So all his sweeps,

1645
01:43:38,351 --> 01:43:40,640
John Jackson just look,
look at all the sweeps in Abu Dhabi.

1646
01:43:40,650 --> 01:43:44,200
He's throwing people around. He, his
first year he submitted everybody.

1647
01:43:44,201 --> 01:43:45,820
He was like the first Marcello Garcia.

1648
01:43:46,330 --> 01:43:50,020
Everybody was freaked out like how
is this guy doing it? They they,

1649
01:43:50,080 --> 01:43:51,170
they didn't even understand it,

1650
01:43:51,171 --> 01:43:54,320
but to me it was like it was
because his game didn't change.

1651
01:43:54,590 --> 01:43:58,000
When he's training in the gay,
he's trained for Abu Dhabi. The,

1652
01:43:58,050 --> 01:43:59,450
the people that we're training in.
The key,

1653
01:43:59,451 --> 01:44:03,320
before they weren't trained for Abu Dhabi,
he was, cause it was all over every,

1654
01:44:03,321 --> 01:44:07,010
he was sweeping wrestlers, all Carro
Uno. He was all over these guys.

1655
01:44:07,250 --> 01:44:11,600
So for me that over Hook
not as not for John Shock,

1656
01:44:11,601 --> 01:44:15,910
that over hook is important for grappling,
not even for valid Tudos.

1657
01:44:15,960 --> 01:44:20,150
So if he did valid due to or if someone
with that style guard did violet tutor,

1658
01:44:20,510 --> 01:44:25,460
the overhead game automatically takes
away the punch and he has authentic from

1659
01:44:25,461 --> 01:44:28,140
that style too.
So for me that became the,

1660
01:44:28,300 --> 01:44:33,300
the basis and the focus for the ultimate
MMA guard was to master the over Hook

1661
01:44:34,191 --> 01:44:34,640
like,

1662
01:44:34,640 --> 01:44:38,750
like John Jock and not only just defend
but put those butterflies in and try to

1663
01:44:38,751 --> 01:44:42,680
sweep or set up triangles like you,
you have an overlook you sweet pea basis,

1664
01:44:42,681 --> 01:44:47,080
you grab that risk boom triangles.
So I thought that was the uh,

1665
01:44:47,120 --> 01:44:51,770
based on what you and Hanzo did and John
Jack style because because of it was

1666
01:44:51,771 --> 01:44:55,640
like a blessing in disguise. Him
Boring born without fingers. It is,

1667
01:44:55,641 --> 01:44:59,030
it was a blessing disguise.
He's in Abu Dhabi legend.

1668
01:44:59,090 --> 01:45:01,730
Everybody looks at John.
Jack is Yoda.

1669
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:04,850
Like how did you come into Abu
Dhabi and finish everybody?

1670
01:45:05,150 --> 01:45:07,220
To me it was just that overhaul game.

1671
01:45:07,280 --> 01:45:10,670
He didn't really have to change much of
his game. So that's how Marcella Garcia,

1672
01:45:10,671 --> 01:45:14,390
that's his philosophy to his philosophy
is, and he said this in interviews it,

1673
01:45:14,690 --> 01:45:17,120
if you can't do it,
if you training,

1674
01:45:17,150 --> 01:45:20,240
there's a guid technique that
you can't do Nogi throw it out,

1675
01:45:20,300 --> 01:45:24,740
only focus on the techniques that
are going to translate to Nogi.

1676
01:45:25,100 --> 01:45:27,020
So that way when you're
practicing the Geek,

1677
01:45:27,050 --> 01:45:29,120
you're actually practicing Nogi as well.

1678
01:45:29,180 --> 01:45:34,180
So John Jea or Marcello is very against
being reliant too much on the color and

1679
01:45:35,001 --> 01:45:38,420
too much on the sleeve. He stays away
from that because even take downs,

1680
01:45:38,421 --> 01:45:41,050
he doesn't want to do
judo takedowns because no,

1681
01:45:41,230 --> 01:45:42,350
that are not going to work as much.

1682
01:45:42,351 --> 01:45:46,880
He wants to do take downs at the
in the guid that translate Nogi.

1683
01:45:47,330 --> 01:45:51,120
So, um, that was, that's just this,

1684
01:45:51,530 --> 01:45:53,210
the conclusions that I came to,

1685
01:45:53,211 --> 01:45:55,430
that's how I trained my fighters
that are finding an Mba.

1686
01:45:55,730 --> 01:45:58,880
And it all started with
watching you and Henson. Yes.

1687
01:45:58,880 --> 01:46:01,370
I, I completely, you know, fuel,

1688
01:46:01,371 --> 01:46:06,371
like that's a good standard position too
because you have to have a control in

1689
01:46:06,381 --> 01:46:10,490
stuff. But the evolutionary process
brought all that kinds of the guards,

1690
01:46:10,491 --> 01:46:15,190
you know, and uh, I kind
of also, uh, find my,

1691
01:46:15,230 --> 01:46:16,970
my comfortable those days and,

1692
01:46:17,200 --> 01:46:21,800
and ensure a more spacey guard.

1693
01:46:21,801 --> 01:46:25,610
The more like towards my father's guard
was because he's was very weak guy,

1694
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:31,000
always handle big guys and he don't have
like this kind of strength or control

1695
01:46:31,720 --> 01:46:33,320
Europe over here,
his opponents.

1696
01:46:33,680 --> 01:46:38,270
So he was more like hip movements and
using the ankles, losing the food,

1697
01:46:38,690 --> 01:46:42,890
you know, it's more like a, a
very Lito from the bottom, uh,

1698
01:46:43,060 --> 01:46:44,210
allowing the guy to get lost.

1699
01:46:44,211 --> 01:46:49,211
So it's a combination between the two I
think is today's is the perfect option.

1700
01:46:50,540 --> 01:46:55,540
Why do you think Ronda Rousey is
the only fighter in MMA today?

1701
01:46:56,990 --> 01:47:01,880
That when she, she's pulling off her arm
bar. Looks Amazing. Have you seen her?

1702
01:47:01,881 --> 01:47:05,210
I like, of course it's why his,
as soon as she's in the guard,

1703
01:47:05,300 --> 01:47:06,370
as soon as she's not going to wait,

1704
01:47:06,410 --> 01:47:09,290
she's going to go and attack that
arm and she goes right to it.

1705
01:47:09,291 --> 01:47:14,270
She doesn't wipe and I've trained with
their many times and her arm bar is legit.

1706
01:47:14,300 --> 01:47:17,150
It's, it's not a joke. It's, yeah. To me,

1707
01:47:17,360 --> 01:47:20,150
I think she has the best arm
bar in MMA today because she's,

1708
01:47:20,240 --> 01:47:22,310
no one has pulled it off
as much as she hadn't. Yes.

1709
01:47:22,311 --> 01:47:26,210
She hasn't really gone against
top level Jujitsu girls. But, uh,

1710
01:47:26,211 --> 01:47:30,470
based on me training with her, I
think that she can, she can tap out.

1711
01:47:30,471 --> 01:47:33,890
It's going to be harder of course.
But why do you think she's the only one?

1712
01:47:33,891 --> 01:47:37,460
And there's all these black belts
and Jujitsu and MMA and they're not,

1713
01:47:37,610 --> 01:47:39,890
they don't look anything like
Rhonda Rousey. Why is that?

1714
01:47:40,880 --> 01:47:45,650
Um, she's a special girl.
She's very competitive. She's,

1715
01:47:45,651 --> 01:47:49,880
she's a very talented person.
But a side of this,

1716
01:47:50,360 --> 01:47:52,940
she have a heavy trainee in judo,

1717
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:58,400
which defines her character,
you know, defines her hair,

1718
01:47:58,410 --> 01:48:02,250
her desire to train,
hard to compete too.

1719
01:48:02,570 --> 01:48:03,590
So being a,

1720
01:48:03,591 --> 01:48:08,591
an Olympic level judo player is
being a wrestler in that level.

1721
01:48:09,590 --> 01:48:13,880
That's bringing Q two on different
level, you know, it's not being just, um,

1722
01:48:13,940 --> 01:48:16,850
an athlete.
She is a super athlete.

1723
01:48:17,300 --> 01:48:21,280
She is very defined and
very, very much, uh,

1724
01:48:22,010 --> 01:48:25,460
specialize in one thing.
Their game.

1725
01:48:25,790 --> 01:48:30,790
She hair game is always like going towards
the same pattern and in the opponents

1726
01:48:32,661 --> 01:48:35,090
she's facing a,

1727
01:48:35,140 --> 01:48:38,660
he is not exactly prepare for that.

1728
01:48:38,810 --> 01:48:43,810
I feel like nobody has the
skills on the ground to,

1729
01:48:44,490 --> 01:48:47,240
to,
to fight her and nobody has the,

1730
01:48:47,600 --> 01:48:51,410
the heavy hands in the situation to,
to beat here in standing up.

1731
01:48:51,950 --> 01:48:56,190
So everything's kind of even up. But
Gwen goes to the ground when the, the,

1732
01:48:56,520 --> 01:49:01,520
the opponent gets the first troll and
falls like without seeing it get lost.

1733
01:49:02,031 --> 01:49:06,110
And then she, she, her movements
are very, very effective and, and,

1734
01:49:06,470 --> 01:49:10,430
and we will capitalize on
that. But you know, um,

1735
01:49:11,150 --> 01:49:15,610
maybe five fights,
then fights more beautiful winds.

1736
01:49:15,611 --> 01:49:20,611
But eventually she got to have a person
who has the same elements and then she's

1737
01:49:22,201 --> 01:49:23,870
going to start, you have
competition, you know,

1738
01:49:23,871 --> 01:49:26,540
because so far it feels like
even too easy, you know,

1739
01:49:26,541 --> 01:49:29,480
it's like not even a competition for it.
She's like a Mike Tyson.

1740
01:49:29,610 --> 01:49:31,330
She's like,
when Mike Tyson was his job,

1741
01:49:33,500 --> 01:49:36,510
eventually a Cyborg.
Rhonda is going to happen.

1742
01:49:36,540 --> 01:49:39,930
Dana's going to make sure that happens
eventually. How do you see that going?

1743
01:49:41,350 --> 01:49:44,970
Oh, that's interesting
because you know, um,

1744
01:49:45,940 --> 01:49:50,740
she will have the, the
preparation, the mindset,

1745
01:49:51,250 --> 01:49:53,780
the heavy hands and also the, the, the,

1746
01:49:53,781 --> 01:49:58,510
the skill to become like a,
a competitive for four Honda I think.

1747
01:49:58,570 --> 01:50:02,890
And he's unpredictable. Like,
you know, any fight, you know,

1748
01:50:03,730 --> 01:50:05,200
you gotta put your money down,
who would you,

1749
01:50:06,070 --> 01:50:10,990
there's no reason for me to put my mind.
And then Honda,

1750
01:50:11,110 --> 01:50:15,080
I mean, he's in a good, I mean
I, it's getting better too.

1751
01:50:16,850 --> 01:50:18,750
Did you see her last fight?
Yeah, she's improved.

1752
01:50:18,780 --> 01:50:22,630
She's throwing combinations with
the judo throws and her throws.

1753
01:50:22,631 --> 01:50:25,590
They're just out of control.
Yeah.

1754
01:50:25,620 --> 01:50:29,400
She starts throwing people and,
and new HSA.

1755
01:50:29,410 --> 01:50:31,680
When she found me shut Meesha,
the legit wrestler,

1756
01:50:31,840 --> 01:50:34,810
Meesha can Russell and she was
making some big mistakes though.

1757
01:50:34,840 --> 01:50:38,050
She was very high up on her. Above
her weight was above the hips. I mean,

1758
01:50:38,140 --> 01:50:40,870
I think there was a lot of pressure
involved in that fight. She would,

1759
01:50:41,970 --> 01:50:46,970
you would think that when you in Nma
generally when someone starts doing

1760
01:50:47,591 --> 01:50:50,350
something that's effective,
that wasn't a done before.

1761
01:50:50,380 --> 01:50:53,350
Like the front snap kick that
Travis Browne is doing now.

1762
01:50:53,500 --> 01:50:54,850
Serone he's doing it all the time.

1763
01:50:54,880 --> 01:50:59,080
Nobody was stolen that we need to see it
first work in the UFC. Nickel, Oh man,

1764
01:50:59,081 --> 01:51:03,190
the front snap kick or the rear leg snap
kick to the chest and that's working.

1765
01:51:03,220 --> 01:51:06,000
So that's huge. Now, five
years ago, no one throw it.

1766
01:51:06,130 --> 01:51:07,960
They thought it was a waste of time.
It doesn't work.

1767
01:51:07,961 --> 01:51:11,890
That only works in the movies. But
there's all these kicks, head kicks and,

1768
01:51:12,220 --> 01:51:17,220
and now that we've seen Rhonda show the
effectiveness of focusing and drilling

1769
01:51:18,371 --> 01:51:21,580
that armbar over and over,
and she talks about you. I do.

1770
01:51:21,581 --> 01:51:25,840
You think people aren't paying attention
to it and aren't going? Look what works.

1771
01:51:25,870 --> 01:51:29,860
Look what happens with the arm bar when
you do it 100,000 times. Let's do that.

1772
01:51:29,861 --> 01:51:32,770
Let's do you think they're not
doing it because she's a girl?

1773
01:51:33,910 --> 01:51:38,680
No one's paying attention. Really,
you would think is easy. I mean,

1774
01:51:39,220 --> 01:51:43,630
hair performance is, it
reflects, it reflects a life.

1775
01:51:43,990 --> 01:51:48,970
Even her parents aren't
involved in judo. Yeah. So, uh,

1776
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:54,000
it's a lifetime of achievements is a
subconscious reflex is not something which

1777
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:56,110
you educate people.

1778
01:51:56,200 --> 01:51:58,960
It's like you don't think you could
learn it if you practiced hard enough,

1779
01:51:59,860 --> 01:52:03,340
you have to be like a,
at least a classification.

1780
01:52:03,350 --> 01:52:05,560
The classification phase to go to the top,

1781
01:52:06,010 --> 01:52:10,720
top 10 in judo is not just
learn is dedicate yourself,

1782
01:52:10,721 --> 01:52:14,470
your sweat and tears and blood is
intensity to get there. You know,

1783
01:52:14,471 --> 01:52:17,440
it's like being a Jujitsu
champion is one thing.

1784
01:52:17,980 --> 01:52:20,320
Doing what crown does two days.
Another thing.

1785
01:52:20,350 --> 01:52:25,350
He is not only fighting hard but he goes
and train hard and your run hide and

1786
01:52:26,411 --> 01:52:30,280
lift weights. Whatever he does, he
does with the compromise to excel.

1787
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,910
And that's a mindset. There's
not exactly, you teach,

1788
01:52:34,120 --> 01:52:38,770
it's something I believe Honda
is a special girl because
she put herself in that

1789
01:52:38,771 --> 01:52:43,720
kind of level of stress and she handled
and she, I mean the training is hard.

1790
01:52:43,721 --> 01:52:46,250
The comps, the focus
is hard. She's serious.

1791
01:52:46,670 --> 01:52:51,490
And does the whole formula is there to
support him, have victories, you know,

1792
01:52:51,860 --> 01:52:54,620
he's not a flake or it's not as
good luck. You know, he's not,

1793
01:52:54,890 --> 01:52:58,760
oh [inaudible] come here, let me show
how to defend the analog and now you go,

1794
01:52:58,761 --> 01:53:03,110
you ready to fight? It's not like
that, you know, so anyone in the,

1795
01:53:03,111 --> 01:53:04,390
in the mixed martial arts,

1796
01:53:04,391 --> 01:53:09,020
it's coming from a background because
they see mixed martial arts egg as a good

1797
01:53:09,021 --> 01:53:12,710
exposure,
as a good situation to make money to me.

1798
01:53:13,070 --> 01:53:17,960
So they come in with I average
background to try, you know,

1799
01:53:17,990 --> 01:53:20,960
their best.
They sometimes having from the the,

1800
01:53:20,961 --> 01:53:25,130
the Hasni family and then learning some
box, some Jujitsu, some defense and go,

1801
01:53:25,580 --> 01:53:27,800
they're coming from the judo and goal.

1802
01:53:27,930 --> 01:53:31,610
They're going to be from the Jujitsu and
go into learning a little bit here and

1803
01:53:31,611 --> 01:53:36,140
there.
But very few are like,

1804
01:53:36,170 --> 01:53:39,890
uh, like uh, Randy couture,

1805
01:53:39,980 --> 01:53:42,710
which is already
established champion like a,

1806
01:53:43,100 --> 01:53:46,490
like a Coleman,
you know,

1807
01:53:46,491 --> 01:53:49,610
guys who have defined their lives in,

1808
01:53:49,611 --> 01:53:54,470
in one thing and then they
breed to another, but they
have already the sense of,

1809
01:53:54,860 --> 01:53:56,420
you know,
they believe in themselves.

1810
01:53:56,421 --> 01:54:00,200
They can capitalize on the
mistakes they forward forever.

1811
01:54:00,201 --> 01:54:03,050
So those things that, you
know, you don't buy it on the,

1812
01:54:03,051 --> 01:54:05,930
on the work ethic on the
supermarket, you know, those things,

1813
01:54:05,940 --> 01:54:08,790
his lifetime experience is high chew.
Yeah.

1814
01:54:08,820 --> 01:54:12,370
The intensity that Ronda Rousey brings,
the training just to life itself.

1815
01:54:12,371 --> 01:54:15,340
It's very difficult to
replicate and that it has,

1816
01:54:15,341 --> 01:54:18,460
it resonates throughout
everything she does. She's crazy.

1817
01:54:18,760 --> 01:54:22,120
Now when in the best way,
crone when against Shinier Okie.

1818
01:54:22,121 --> 01:54:25,960
I'm assuming that you studied
a lot of Shinya Aoki tapes.

1819
01:54:26,600 --> 01:54:29,710
Do you I personally think he's,
uh,

1820
01:54:30,130 --> 01:54:34,690
one of the best at Jujitsu and MMA as
far as he's gotten so many submissions.

1821
01:54:34,810 --> 01:54:35,980
You get you with leg locks.

1822
01:54:36,240 --> 01:54:40,040
He has a great rear naked choke
has guards really good. Yes. Um,

1823
01:54:40,090 --> 01:54:42,680
were you impressed by
watching tape of a Shinya?

1824
01:54:43,060 --> 01:54:45,190
Shinya is not only I'm impressed by tapes.

1825
01:54:45,280 --> 01:54:49,170
The first Buddha challenge I did
he win with honors. You know, he,

1826
01:54:49,190 --> 01:54:52,240
he winded the Buddha challenge in
some meeting. Everybody, you know,

1827
01:54:52,720 --> 01:54:56,560
he won your yeah, the [inaudible]
has different way divisions.

1828
01:54:57,100 --> 01:55:01,000
And here's way division. He makes you
fight since we meet bolt. And who,

1829
01:55:01,001 --> 01:55:03,840
who were the guys? Do
you remember? Uh, uh,

1830
01:55:05,630 --> 01:55:10,350
Carl. He fought two guys too.

1831
01:55:10,390 --> 01:55:13,250
I didn't even really know who he was
in 2005 to tell you the truth then you

1832
01:55:13,251 --> 01:55:17,270
already know. Yeah. So anyway,
I felt how Tavi, how tight,

1833
01:55:17,271 --> 01:55:19,760
how tight to help rescission.
His submission,

1834
01:55:19,910 --> 01:55:23,600
he got a flying arm in lock in the first
guy and the food log in the second guy.

1835
01:55:23,601 --> 01:55:26,640
So I felt like he's very
versatile, versatile, you know,

1836
01:55:26,720 --> 01:55:30,380
he has a highlight reel of judo where
he would define armbars in judo,

1837
01:55:30,390 --> 01:55:35,220
just one after another.
And that's was something I absorbed in.

1838
01:55:35,260 --> 01:55:37,730
Then we, in our training
we've grown, I said,

1839
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:41,080
and we are kind of decide to,

1840
01:55:41,650 --> 01:55:45,810
because he was very comfortable
when you engage on the grip.

1841
01:55:47,100 --> 01:55:51,630
So from your grip he can go for a flying
triangle flying. I'm lots and such.

1842
01:55:52,830 --> 01:55:54,330
So crown was pressuring him.

1843
01:55:54,331 --> 01:55:59,331
We doubting engage using the food and
trying to make him feel like he has drew

1844
01:55:59,771 --> 01:56:03,870
engaged, not grown grabbing. So
that's kind of give the first,

1845
01:56:04,770 --> 01:56:07,410
the first way for him to feel like lost.

1846
01:56:07,410 --> 01:56:11,760
He was expecting chrome to attempt but
grown was pressuring without grabbing.

1847
01:56:11,790 --> 01:56:14,100
If you see the fight again,
you see so,

1848
01:56:14,101 --> 01:56:18,600
and the one point they engage
crumpled to the guard and uh,

1849
01:56:18,630 --> 01:56:23,400
he was kind of trying to stay and couldn't
go to the head ones he can escape and

1850
01:56:23,401 --> 01:56:26,880
then chrome finish with the
headlock as when the rule.

1851
01:56:27,450 --> 01:56:29,490
But the guy is very tough.

1852
01:56:29,660 --> 01:56:33,840
We are not worried about these Jujitsu
back and forth like that tempts him to

1853
01:56:33,841 --> 01:56:38,020
submit ground. Those are hard to catch
because grown is very skewed to defend.

1854
01:56:38,730 --> 01:56:43,380
But is he good at defending leg locks?
Chrome? Yes, yes. But uh, still,

1855
01:56:43,800 --> 01:56:48,090
uh,
the opportunity was raised based on,

1856
01:56:48,091 --> 01:56:52,350
he is his desire to act.
So we forced him to act.

1857
01:56:52,560 --> 01:56:57,560
He gave what we want and crunk catch
precisely and sharp and was over every,

1858
01:56:58,630 --> 01:57:01,480
every morning.
Every time I work out and go to the gym,

1859
01:57:01,481 --> 01:57:05,700
I warm up on a stairmaster
and I just go ADCC, Marcella,

1860
01:57:05,710 --> 01:57:07,840
Darcy or whoever.
And I just,

1861
01:57:07,870 --> 01:57:10,780
I just want to warm up and watch
people do Jujitsu at a high level.

1862
01:57:10,870 --> 01:57:13,750
And that just gets my blood boiling and
I just want to go lift weights. Right?

1863
01:57:14,050 --> 01:57:19,050
So I'm watching a Marcello
and crone and Matt recently,

1864
01:57:19,210 --> 01:57:23,350
and I'm watching the last one. Yeah. And
I haven't watched it in awhile, but man,

1865
01:57:23,470 --> 01:57:27,520
I'm so used to Marcello just
going through everybody.

1866
01:57:27,670 --> 01:57:30,110
Marcella just brushes.

1867
01:57:30,130 --> 01:57:34,960
He is unbelievable what he does.
People go to his gym, he's like, hey,

1868
01:57:35,050 --> 01:57:36,850
you can come to my gym,
I'll roll with you,

1869
01:57:37,030 --> 01:57:40,330
but we're going to videotape it and
we're gonna put it on the Internet deal.

1870
01:57:40,390 --> 01:57:42,370
And they're like everyone that
goes, there's like, Oh Matt here.

1871
01:57:42,371 --> 01:57:47,040
Like they're walking into the slaughter
slaughterhouse, right? He puts on a,

1872
01:57:47,270 --> 01:57:51,940
everyone's going to see the role. So
that's, and he just crushes everybody.

1873
01:57:51,941 --> 01:57:55,570
Big dudes. And then for him,
when he went against crone,

1874
01:57:55,810 --> 01:58:00,370
he passed crones guard for a couple
seconds. But then after that initial, he,

1875
01:58:00,371 --> 01:58:02,010
it was a double leg dragon.
He jumped in.

1876
01:58:02,230 --> 01:58:05,650
And then crones ability to recover.

1877
01:58:05,651 --> 01:58:08,560
Full Guard is unlike
anybody I've ever seen.

1878
01:58:08,680 --> 01:58:13,450
You rarely see full guard in Abu Dhabi.
People stay away from full guard,

1879
01:58:13,451 --> 01:58:16,220
but chrome will force uni,
forest,

1880
01:58:16,640 --> 01:58:18,850
Marcella Garcia and
crone into full garden.

1881
01:58:19,060 --> 01:58:21,430
Marcella was having a hard
time and then he broke it,

1882
01:58:21,460 --> 01:58:22,720
finally broke open his full guard,

1883
01:58:22,721 --> 01:58:26,560
then he tried to pass again and then he's
back and full guard again. And then, uh,

1884
01:58:26,561 --> 01:58:30,730
um, crump, put them in a
guillotine and the word is,

1885
01:58:30,740 --> 01:58:35,320
and Marcel I think admits this, he went
out, like he went out to him and he said,

1886
01:58:35,560 --> 01:58:36,393
Whoa,
that

1887
01:58:37,290 --> 01:58:40,430
almost best south. And then, but grown he,

1888
01:58:40,550 --> 01:58:44,410
because it going in the end off
the mat, the first, like the round,

1889
01:58:45,310 --> 01:58:49,360
he was trying to save himself
for it for the next round. So he,

1890
01:58:49,660 --> 01:58:52,210
he put pressure and then he kind of said,
dad,

1891
01:58:52,211 --> 01:58:56,620
I kind of just try to hold instead,
keeping putting all my power.

1892
01:58:57,070 --> 01:58:58,690
So, and then, I mean,

1893
01:58:58,720 --> 01:59:02,830
nothing happened and the guy kind
of survive and he kind of won.

1894
01:59:02,831 --> 01:59:04,990
But you won on a take down
so that it could have,

1895
01:59:05,210 --> 01:59:09,250
he could have put them to sleep there if
that's possible. I mean it's, you know,

1896
01:59:09,251 --> 01:59:11,220
but that's always the
thing with the guillotine,

1897
01:59:11,230 --> 01:59:15,550
knowing whether or not to exert all your
energy and gas, you're honest, but crony,

1898
01:59:15,570 --> 01:59:17,630
specializing the guillotine.
I mean,

1899
01:59:18,130 --> 01:59:22,830
he coming in the next for the next,
for the lest Abu Dhabi prepared to, to,

1900
01:59:22,960 --> 01:59:27,460
to face Marcel again. And here's this
guy, Laney, his progress is being very,

1901
01:59:27,461 --> 01:59:32,430
very, you know,
progressive. And um, and uh,

1902
01:59:32,470 --> 01:59:35,440
he was ready,
but fortunately Marcel didn't,

1903
01:59:35,450 --> 01:59:38,680
she didn't come and he made great
fights and he displayed like,

1904
01:59:39,010 --> 01:59:41,370
especially the good routine against Tanu.

1905
01:59:41,630 --> 01:59:46,180
[inaudible] what's great in the final,
the guy just when he jumps,

1906
01:59:46,181 --> 01:59:49,680
and I feel like you guys talking
about this fight and about the chicken

1907
01:59:50,650 --> 01:59:53,330
[inaudible] it.
At first I didn't believe it.

1908
01:59:53,331 --> 01:59:57,350
I'm like someone explain it to people
who didn't hear our other podcasts. Well,

1909
01:59:57,780 --> 02:00:00,170
what chrome,
when in 2013,

1910
02:00:00,171 --> 02:00:05,090
Abu Dhabi crone showed up and did with,
with what only I think maybe,

1911
02:00:05,140 --> 02:00:09,680
uh, John Jog did it. Marcella did it
and I think maybe Hodgett Gracie did it.

1912
02:00:09,681 --> 02:00:13,700
I'm not sure that he went in and submitted
all four of his opponents and in the,

1913
02:00:13,750 --> 02:00:17,630
uh, he, he submitted Gary Tonin
in an amazing match with guests.

1914
02:00:17,720 --> 02:00:20,540
Last fight I saw. Incredible.
Yeah, it was incredible.

1915
02:00:20,541 --> 02:00:25,070
I was losing my mind watching that
one. And, and he submitted JT Torres,

1916
02:00:25,280 --> 02:00:30,140
who's a beast, j d tours. So good. And
he got them from the guard. He got it.

1917
02:00:30,200 --> 02:00:33,530
He just had the overlook
and he just flipped his leg
over his face and just held

1918
02:00:33,531 --> 02:00:36,980
onto the over. Cause it was kind of like
one of those over hook arm bars and,

1919
02:00:37,380 --> 02:00:41,840
and then he beat a, who did
he beat first? I don't know.

1920
02:00:41,841 --> 02:00:42,674
But the first

1921
02:00:42,680 --> 02:00:44,770
one was like a,
I'm not sure his name,

1922
02:00:44,771 --> 02:00:49,090
but he put a guy to sleep and then get
this Gary Guy and the first day. Yeah.

1923
02:00:49,091 --> 02:00:50,610
And then join the second danger

1924
02:00:51,770 --> 02:00:53,250
and then I'll tell me on the finals,

1925
02:00:53,270 --> 02:00:56,240
well the match we're talking about and
me and Joe talked about this and they

1926
02:00:56,241 --> 02:01:00,890
made a, Stewart Cooper made a
film on it, but Oh Tevya Sousa.

1927
02:01:01,280 --> 02:01:05,360
His strategy was to not be honest back,

1928
02:01:05,420 --> 02:01:10,330
stay on top and just kind of maybe
get a takedown late, you know,

1929
02:01:10,340 --> 02:01:11,090
cause that's a,

1930
02:01:11,090 --> 02:01:15,710
in that rule format or that points format
in Abu Dhabi that that happens a lot.

1931
02:01:15,711 --> 02:01:19,610
People will just Russell and Russell
and Russell and uh, he wasn't engaging.

1932
02:01:19,640 --> 02:01:24,080
And crone is like, like just like Hixon
saying, he's like Marcello. He's like,

1933
02:01:24,110 --> 02:01:28,280
he goes after it, he's going to go
100%. All he wants is the submission.

1934
02:01:28,281 --> 02:01:31,310
That's cronies, especial
grappler, special fighter.

1935
02:01:31,550 --> 02:01:36,290
All he wants is the submission. And
Oh, Tevya wasn't really engaging.

1936
02:01:36,710 --> 02:01:40,070
And as a father, no,
no, no, not as a fire.

1937
02:01:40,070 --> 02:01:40,903
As a coach.

1938
02:01:41,240 --> 02:01:45,470
I saw his coach as the fight progress.

1939
02:01:46,010 --> 02:01:50,210
The guy saying [inaudible] Portuguese.
Okay man, that's it. That's all you want.

1940
02:01:50,211 --> 02:01:53,000
Okay, keep going. It's
perfect. Perfect. Perfect.

1941
02:01:53,300 --> 02:01:57,710
And I see a guy just running from
the fight in making strategy,

1942
02:01:57,711 --> 02:02:00,110
which kind of upset me completely.

1943
02:02:00,111 --> 02:02:03,170
I mean there's nothing perfect
on dead in my sense. And,

1944
02:02:03,190 --> 02:02:05,940
but in the strategic aspect of He's,
he's,

1945
02:02:06,090 --> 02:02:11,090
he's doing so I have to counter in
somehow and then I start to make sure,

1946
02:02:12,760 --> 02:02:15,470
try to suggest the referee.
He was escaping.

1947
02:02:15,471 --> 02:02:19,880
He was try to avoid the fight because
it's not positive points in the first 10

1948
02:02:19,881 --> 02:02:24,800
minutes, but it's negative points. So I
was hoping for a negative 0.2 with dot.

1949
02:02:24,880 --> 02:02:27,080
Well followed. This is stalling. So,

1950
02:02:27,081 --> 02:02:30,110
and then I start to say [inaudible]
the guy stature moving like you know,

1951
02:02:30,111 --> 02:02:33,710
he don't want to engage you.
It's just moving back like
a chicken la, la La la La.

1952
02:02:34,310 --> 02:02:37,190
And as the thing starts,
you're boiling. I start to say,

1953
02:02:37,191 --> 02:02:38,600
hey mountain sky like a chicken

1954
02:02:41,600 --> 02:02:45,470
and the whole stage was this
quiet watching the fight
is just this noise kind of

1955
02:02:45,870 --> 02:02:46,703
overwhelming.

1956
02:02:48,080 --> 02:02:52,880
It's like throwing a chicken inside in a
for a Jujitsu competitor. First of all.

1957
02:02:53,490 --> 02:02:56,430
I mean I know you're, you're right
here but I just have to be honest.

1958
02:02:56,431 --> 02:02:58,440
Everybody says you're the greatest ever.

1959
02:02:58,470 --> 02:03:00,480
You're the greatest Jujitsu
competitor of all time.

1960
02:03:00,660 --> 02:03:03,930
So you are here the greatest
Jujitsu representative of all time.

1961
02:03:03,931 --> 02:03:05,220
Your son is competing.

1962
02:03:05,221 --> 02:03:09,490
This guy has to respect
you and admire you and your

1963
02:03:09,600 --> 02:03:13,620
going Bock, bock, bock, bock, bock, bock
and the whole crowd is listening to this.

1964
02:03:13,640 --> 02:03:15,420
I mean that's a lot of
pressure on that guy.

1965
02:03:15,440 --> 02:03:18,190
How to get into his head
because in his book,

1966
02:03:18,600 --> 02:03:21,420
because I was suggesting the referee,

1967
02:03:21,570 --> 02:03:26,570
he needs should be punished and
eventually like with 90 minutes or so,

1968
02:03:26,851 --> 02:03:31,851
he get minus points and that's what's
exactly what generates him to say,

1969
02:03:31,951 --> 02:03:36,360
okay, now I'm hunting, be
raw honey running behind.
So I have to make it happen.

1970
02:03:36,930 --> 02:03:40,950
And as we talk and afterwards we've
grown, grown said dad, when I do start,

1971
02:03:40,951 --> 02:03:43,920
you're talking like a chicken.
I felt like he wanted explore them.

1972
02:03:44,130 --> 02:03:47,750
I don't want to make a mistake wasting
the opportunity, but I know he will come.

1973
02:03:47,751 --> 02:03:51,090
He so I was just ready for it.
So we kind of working together,

1974
02:03:51,091 --> 02:03:54,660
you know like it wasn't a father
and son Warren was perfect.

1975
02:03:54,660 --> 02:03:59,010
He shot right in and then he's already
waiting for boom is over. Go home.

1976
02:03:59,150 --> 02:04:02,730
Oh it's ice cream. That's one
thing. That's the one thing
John Jack would tell me,

1977
02:04:02,731 --> 02:04:04,200
cause train for John.

1978
02:04:04,201 --> 02:04:08,340
Jock obviously trained me from metamorris
and we would talk about crone and and

1979
02:04:08,341 --> 02:04:12,990
John Jack said, I asked John Junk, what
is crones best technique? He goes, man,

1980
02:04:12,991 --> 02:04:16,770
that guillotine,
he wraps his arms around your head.

1981
02:04:16,950 --> 02:04:18,690
He's got an incredible squeeze.

1982
02:04:19,470 --> 02:04:22,860
The guillotine used to
be a strong man move.

1983
02:04:22,861 --> 02:04:26,070
Like I used to think of like even the
arm and guillotine like that's a strong

1984
02:04:26,071 --> 02:04:28,740
man. I never got into
guillotines but over the last 10,

1985
02:04:28,741 --> 02:04:33,550
15 years they've gotten
so told him, I said, um,

1986
02:04:33,720 --> 02:04:37,890
I'm always been trying to specialize
myself in all the submissions

1987
02:04:38,820 --> 02:04:42,750
and I have my good routine,
which you know, giving me
some victories, but you know,

1988
02:04:43,560 --> 02:04:47,310
and then one day at one time I was
talking if grown on, it's not even on the,

1989
02:04:47,311 --> 02:04:51,300
on the mat was in the locker room.
And then I said, yeah, but you know,

1990
02:04:51,310 --> 02:04:54,140
team and you have the guy can escapes at
an old dead, those Inchcape. I said, no,

1991
02:04:54,141 --> 02:04:58,770
it's Kevin. I said, hello? He said, no,
if I get it. I said, I'll come on, man.

1992
02:04:58,771 --> 02:05:00,990
Grabbed me, man, I tap you.

1993
02:05:02,040 --> 02:05:06,360
And then I have to rethink
my whole strategy said,
yeah, this guy has, you know,

1994
02:05:06,450 --> 02:05:07,960
he's already have something to tell me.

1995
02:05:07,961 --> 02:05:12,270
His levels of squeeze right is the
level of grip is a level of grab.

1996
02:05:12,330 --> 02:05:17,330
The way you hold is all technical and
these did regular escape doesn't work

1997
02:05:17,941 --> 02:05:22,340
anymore.
So of course we have escape for crones,

1998
02:05:23,120 --> 02:05:26,610
Cha Guillotine, but it's a
different than I was visualizing.

1999
02:05:26,610 --> 02:05:31,610
So I have to learn how to escape
from Everage guillotines and Crohn's

2000
02:05:32,380 --> 02:05:35,550
guillotine. So it has to be
special. The defense, those levels,

2001
02:05:35,551 --> 02:05:38,760
the technical levels are lost on a lot
of people that are just watching it.

2002
02:05:38,761 --> 02:05:42,060
The differences, subtle variations.
That is the essence of Jujitsu.

2003
02:05:42,390 --> 02:05:46,320
I believe the beast, the biggest
aspect of Jujitsu is invisible.

2004
02:05:47,430 --> 02:05:50,340
My, I pray I'm in I my, my, my,

2005
02:05:50,550 --> 02:05:55,550
I preach the invisible Jujitsu because
easy visible because you see it but you

2006
02:05:57,121 --> 02:06:00,420
don't see it. You see the same guide
position. You see the same amount,

2007
02:06:00,990 --> 02:06:03,790
but you have to feel it. You know, I,

2008
02:06:03,791 --> 02:06:06,330
I base my Jujitsu and how you feel,

2009
02:06:06,750 --> 02:06:10,320
not what you see and that's
just totally different.

2010
02:06:10,321 --> 02:06:15,000
When I go in the seminars and stuff, the
guy feel different. They say, wow man,

2011
02:06:15,001 --> 02:06:19,010
I've been doing this all my life and I
never felt this way. So, so good though.

2012
02:06:19,060 --> 02:06:23,670
Okay. There's so much leverage. So, so
based on the way distribution base on the,

2013
02:06:24,090 --> 02:06:27,480
on the, on the sense of, of leverage in,

2014
02:06:27,960 --> 02:06:31,620
Oh this can change at the same position
you've seen a picture cannot be worth it

2015
02:06:31,621 --> 02:06:36,510
or it can be very much effective depending
how the grip, the angle, the elbow,

2016
02:06:36,511 --> 02:06:37,291
the,
the weight.

2017
02:06:37,291 --> 02:06:42,291
So it's amazing how the visible
Jujitsu is what really supports the,

2018
02:06:43,230 --> 02:06:45,270
you know,
it's not what you learn superficially.

2019
02:06:45,480 --> 02:06:48,540
What do you think about Marcella
Garcia is variation of the guillotine.

2020
02:06:48,770 --> 02:06:51,930
He that [inaudible] some people call it
a high elbow team and lot of people call

2021
02:06:51,931 --> 02:06:56,680
it the Marcella tin where he
doesn't believe like, like
this. Yeah. What have you,

2022
02:06:57,270 --> 02:07:00,860
is that part of something that you've
taught her? Is that new to you know,

2023
02:07:00,870 --> 02:07:04,980
he's not new is an option which
developed by him like he is,

2024
02:07:05,070 --> 02:07:09,900
he's the master on this, not, so you see
different submissions from the brag. Yeah.

2025
02:07:09,940 --> 02:07:12,990
Ambition. So it's
adaptations, you know, Eh,

2026
02:07:13,380 --> 02:07:17,160
if you focus and you know what's
coming and you have defenses,

2027
02:07:17,790 --> 02:07:21,990
I don't believe a good routine is
effective regardless. No. Yeah.

2028
02:07:22,350 --> 02:07:25,350
All they give the teams you can defend,
but you have to be precise.

2029
02:07:25,351 --> 02:07:26,640
If you make one mistake,

2030
02:07:26,850 --> 02:07:30,480
if you're thinking about defense one
and the guy come in with a little twist,

2031
02:07:30,510 --> 02:07:32,040
the difference one's not going to work.

2032
02:07:32,041 --> 02:07:35,160
And if you think about change for
the second you already tapping,

2033
02:07:35,170 --> 02:07:36,070
are you already sleeping?

2034
02:07:36,340 --> 02:07:40,090
Yes. So you have to be precise
on, on the adaptation of each.

2035
02:07:40,690 --> 02:07:45,190
So now we've grown, gets
me, I know exactly what I
have to go. If I delay five,

2036
02:07:45,430 --> 02:07:50,110
two seconds, then going to over yeah. Is
over. So, and that's, this goes for any,

2037
02:07:50,230 --> 02:07:53,890
any technique. There's so many
different ways to squeeze the neck.

2038
02:07:53,950 --> 02:07:56,640
I would off the top of my head,
you know,

2039
02:07:56,650 --> 02:07:59,170
including all the arm in a chokes,

2040
02:07:59,171 --> 02:08:03,970
like the Darce and the Japanese Necktie,
the arm and Kia teen,

2041
02:08:04,120 --> 02:08:07,510
the different grips,
all these different net cranks.

2042
02:08:07,750 --> 02:08:11,710
There's gotta be just those on the
nosy, various ones. Like how, how, uh,

2043
02:08:11,770 --> 02:08:15,870
how you call the, the neck brace from
like the one, the twister. Yes. Yes.

2044
02:08:16,690 --> 02:08:19,120
That was not really a chunk then
that's just straighten that. Yeah.

2045
02:08:19,720 --> 02:08:23,260
But there's so many ways, just know
[inaudible] there's so many ways to,

2046
02:08:23,280 --> 02:08:24,430
to put someone to sleep.

2047
02:08:24,550 --> 02:08:29,550
I would say there's 15 to 20 different
ways Nogi to squeeze the neck.

2048
02:08:30,671 --> 02:08:34,240
Everyone's got their own different stops.
Did you get into,

2049
02:08:34,241 --> 02:08:37,360
cause one of the most popular chokes
over the last 10, 15 years in the,

2050
02:08:37,370 --> 02:08:41,770
in the Nogi grappling seen is
the Darce are you familiar with,

2051
02:08:41,771 --> 02:08:45,880
what is the dose like? Bravo choke. It's
the, it's a bravo joke. It's a squeeze,

2052
02:08:45,910 --> 02:08:50,170
but it's the arms back. No,
no. From top sites. Like yes,

2053
02:08:51,160 --> 02:08:52,790
I'm going to half guard
like and half guard.

2054
02:08:52,791 --> 02:08:55,340
And you come in and it's like you have
an over Hook and you'd come and raise

2055
02:08:55,341 --> 02:08:56,174
that one.

2056
02:08:56,650 --> 02:09:01,000
That's become just the one of
the most basic standard chokes.

2057
02:09:01,090 --> 02:09:05,500
And it came sort of from a
wrestling a three quarter Nelson,

2058
02:09:05,800 --> 02:09:10,450
a technique that was used to fly
people over. And then, uh, uh,

2059
02:09:10,540 --> 02:09:13,300
I think it was Dave Terrell showed it to,
uh,

2060
02:09:13,420 --> 02:09:17,650
Joe Darcy and then every mark layman's
started calling it Joe Darce because he

2061
02:09:17,651 --> 02:09:19,660
learned from Joe Darce but he,
he actually,

2062
02:09:19,661 --> 02:09:24,240
I don't know John Danaher there's a whole
story but the name stuck to Doris. Um,

2063
02:09:24,700 --> 02:09:29,470
was that something that you guys were
doing back in the seventies and eighties?

2064
02:09:29,740 --> 02:09:34,270
That's more of a newer church and the
people understanding the origins of the

2065
02:09:34,271 --> 02:09:37,040
triangle, like just the leg triangle. Uh,

2066
02:09:37,120 --> 02:09:40,150
there's so many different
theories on where,

2067
02:09:40,180 --> 02:09:45,180
how that got injected into
a Heleo style and like do,

2068
02:09:45,580 --> 02:09:49,010
do you know the origins of a tribe or
is it just an old journal technique? No,

2069
02:09:49,120 --> 02:09:51,460
I mean you feel going to
hold the book techniques,

2070
02:09:51,461 --> 02:09:54,740
you're going to see all the
submissions, you know, like, uh,

2071
02:09:54,790 --> 02:09:57,760
the application of triangles in my life.

2072
02:09:58,070 --> 02:10:00,310
It started Chicago me by,

2073
02:10:00,480 --> 02:10:05,480
by my understanding the concept and seeing
that Longo guys like a Maca home guys

2074
02:10:08,141 --> 02:10:11,540
and we've long legs like Maca,
how, who was the car? My husband

2075
02:10:13,300 --> 02:10:18,190
is like old school guy, old school. I
saw guys doing this and I start to apply,

2076
02:10:18,191 --> 02:10:20,680
you know, I start to you,
my legs are not too long,

2077
02:10:20,681 --> 02:10:24,880
so I have to pick the perfect position
to do, but I start to get, you know,

2078
02:10:24,881 --> 02:10:28,810
familiar with and I,
man, it's just, you know,

2079
02:10:28,811 --> 02:10:33,620
it's hard to say where it come from,
but it's, I have, I have my open mind,

2080
02:10:33,621 --> 02:10:34,180
like

2081
02:10:34,180 --> 02:10:39,080
the Eric Postel situation with the
new, I always have, I opened mine,

2082
02:10:39,081 --> 02:10:43,640
chew a Psap, chew twin brace,
stinks. Our functional, you know,

2083
02:10:43,641 --> 02:10:47,270
and discard everything, which I don't
like it, you know, it's not about theory.

2084
02:10:47,271 --> 02:10:51,710
It's not about, it's about effective and
is about results is about, phew, phew.

2085
02:10:51,711 --> 02:10:54,770
Comfortable there.
So anything I see,

2086
02:10:54,830 --> 02:10:58,310
no matter if it's from Bruce Lee or
from any rest or a catch catch gun,

2087
02:10:58,311 --> 02:11:02,720
or if I see an I like and I want to be
going experiment immediately because I

2088
02:11:02,721 --> 02:11:06,370
just edge my arsenal. You
know, that's the concept, uh,

2089
02:11:06,380 --> 02:11:09,260
which leads shoe to development, to, to,

2090
02:11:09,450 --> 02:11:11,420
to progression and to success.

2091
02:11:11,550 --> 02:11:14,230
It's one of the beautiful things about
Jujitsu is that it's constantly growing.

2092
02:11:14,770 --> 02:11:16,000
There's always new techniques.

2093
02:11:16,001 --> 02:11:20,740
The idea that the Darce
choke wasn't around when you
were competing and now it's

2094
02:11:20,741 --> 02:11:23,620
a staple mainstay.
It's fascinating.

2095
02:11:24,010 --> 02:11:26,350
I'd have to bring this up because
if I didn't bring this up,

2096
02:11:26,351 --> 02:11:27,760
everybody online would go crazy.

2097
02:11:28,330 --> 02:11:33,330
There's a video tape of when Yogi
Anjo showed up at your Dojo and you,

2098
02:11:33,880 --> 02:11:38,100
you, you know, you saw it. No
oil. No, I've never seen it. No,

2099
02:11:38,310 --> 02:11:42,640
he didn't say let's make the next
barbecue and my house definitely wanna sit

2100
02:11:42,700 --> 02:11:46,000
planet the world wants to see
the world wants you. Will you,

2101
02:11:46,030 --> 02:11:50,680
will you release it to the world? Probably
eventually. Oh No, you gotta release it.

2102
02:11:50,681 --> 02:11:54,100
That's one of the number one things that
people are, and when I hit a couple of,

2103
02:11:54,210 --> 02:11:58,510
of people on my site, I may do that. We'll
do a free on the side. Make that happen.

2104
02:11:58,630 --> 02:12:02,770
I won't make that happen. Tell us that
story. How did that story come about?

2105
02:12:03,790 --> 02:12:07,460
Oh, just when I finished
the valley to the 95, uh,

2106
02:12:07,630 --> 02:12:12,450
was a legit eight men
tournament and I won. Um,

2107
02:12:13,480 --> 02:12:15,640
he started the,
uh,

2108
02:12:15,670 --> 02:12:19,060
like the WWF in like as a Ufo in Japan,

2109
02:12:19,061 --> 02:12:23,800
was very strong with pro pro wrestling,
like big magazines,

2110
02:12:23,801 --> 02:12:27,790
like a huge Japanese love pro wrestling.
So,

2111
02:12:27,791 --> 02:12:30,700
and then based on that kind
of exposure of this new event,

2112
02:12:31,300 --> 02:12:33,050
the champion off the rest of the SOC,

2113
02:12:33,130 --> 02:12:37,510
one of the champions off the UFO called
Takada. I start to talk, you know,

2114
02:12:37,511 --> 02:12:38,530
I like to fight The Hague.

2115
02:12:39,050 --> 02:12:42,310
They ask him and they statue talking
like all the pro wrestler stock,

2116
02:12:42,320 --> 02:12:44,710
I going to kick his ass, this and
that. It's not, you're talking,

2117
02:12:44,711 --> 02:12:48,220
are you going to gossip?
And at this point I'm back to La,

2118
02:12:49,360 --> 02:12:51,070
maybe after two or three months off,

2119
02:12:51,071 --> 02:12:55,870
this kind of talking around
my name forever. Some guy,

2120
02:12:55,871 --> 02:12:59,320
some, some, one of the friends I have in
Japan, they come, he said, Mister Greece,

2121
02:13:00,130 --> 02:13:04,300
they talking a lot about you. He, you
should have an official answer for that.

2122
02:13:04,450 --> 02:13:05,670
You know,
you cannot just let,

2123
02:13:05,680 --> 02:13:08,170
because people will start
thinking you afraid people.

2124
02:13:08,590 --> 02:13:13,330
So you have to have official answer. So I
said, okay. So I make a lattice stating,

2125
02:13:13,360 --> 02:13:18,310
um, I was never, we'll fight on
their ringing because they not legit.

2126
02:13:18,340 --> 02:13:21,370
They fixed fights. So
that's against my, if they,

2127
02:13:21,371 --> 02:13:23,950
if you want to come and fight in my event,

2128
02:13:24,130 --> 02:13:28,810
like the nine mine,
but the event I fight and then Japan open,

2129
02:13:29,230 --> 02:13:32,220
he will welcome to Carmen.
We want face each other for sure.

2130
02:13:32,940 --> 02:13:35,670
If other gays we can
find even on the street.

2131
02:13:36,300 --> 02:13:39,850
But I'm not there to fight on his
event because that's who the paradise,

2132
02:13:39,870 --> 02:13:43,080
my real fights status.
He real fighters stairs.

2133
02:13:43,800 --> 02:13:48,240
So with this being said, Cup,
I might, maybe few weeks later,

2134
02:13:48,740 --> 02:13:51,840
that guy that went out of
the, the, the, the, the,

2135
02:13:51,960 --> 02:13:54,790
the gossip and then owns
your show up in the magazine.

2136
02:13:54,790 --> 02:13:59,610
Static he stature saying he
will come into La to beat me up.

2137
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:03,750
He will do this because, because he
said, oh, he's going to fight for free.

2138
02:14:03,751 --> 02:14:08,640
So I wanted there to fight to kick.
So in Dev guy commit and Mr [inaudible],

2139
02:14:08,740 --> 02:14:10,880
he said this said,
man,

2140
02:14:10,890 --> 02:14:15,870
I cannot just lost my sleep based
on his own on justice speculations.

2141
02:14:16,110 --> 02:14:18,720
You're not. He did. He said when
I come now, he didn't said, okay,

2142
02:14:18,721 --> 02:14:22,860
so I want to keep my life and if
you show up, okay, he show up.

2143
02:14:23,730 --> 02:14:26,790
So best may be couple of weeks or so,
even more.

2144
02:14:27,570 --> 02:14:29,520
One day I was in home in the morning,

2145
02:14:30,510 --> 02:14:33,840
my assistant at the school
called me said Hixon some guys,

2146
02:14:33,841 --> 02:14:36,390
yes and Japanese guys are here waiting
for you. I want to talk to you.

2147
02:14:36,680 --> 02:14:40,710
And immediately I figured it out.
Could support, could be that situation.

2148
02:14:41,700 --> 02:14:45,180
So I put my camera in my hand.
Hawkston wants to come in with me.

2149
02:14:45,181 --> 02:14:49,230
He was about 11 years old.
Um,

2150
02:14:50,370 --> 02:14:55,170
I was going back,
driving my car,

2151
02:14:55,171 --> 02:14:57,380
taping my hands because I know when a B,

2152
02:14:58,200 --> 02:15:01,260
so I was putting tape in my
hands as I driving the freeway.

2153
02:15:01,980 --> 02:15:06,980
When I arrive I saw like a van
full up with photographers outside,

2154
02:15:08,730 --> 02:15:09,930
you know,
like the,

2155
02:15:09,931 --> 02:15:13,950
I pass him through my parking lot and I
saw him four of Jap on news with gamma,

2156
02:15:13,951 --> 02:15:18,750
four of reporters inside. So I went
through, when they get in school,

2157
02:15:19,080 --> 02:15:21,930
I saw a huge,
like a tall Japanese guy,

2158
02:15:21,931 --> 02:15:26,730
very well dress it and the lady and I
need that. The Hey, how are you? Oh,

2159
02:15:26,731 --> 02:15:30,000
Mr Gracie,
I'm the president of the Ufo Association.

2160
02:15:30,001 --> 02:15:33,630
I come here to officially invite you to
participate on a fight in Japan. I said,

2161
02:15:33,631 --> 02:15:36,570
man, you crazy. I told you I
don't want to fight in Japan.

2162
02:15:36,570 --> 02:15:41,570
And then their your association and then
the onsite when I kind of deflect the

2163
02:15:42,061 --> 02:15:42,960
direction. He said, yeah,

2164
02:15:42,961 --> 02:15:45,540
but you also said you'll fight
for free for your owner in.

2165
02:15:45,960 --> 02:15:48,360
I said yes and he had to fight.

2166
02:15:48,361 --> 02:15:51,210
They specked fighting you but you
come into to negotiate. No, no, no.

2167
02:15:51,211 --> 02:15:55,740
By the fight there is outside.
Can you come? He coming? He
said, yes, he can come me.

2168
02:15:55,741 --> 02:15:59,580
So I tell my student, just say,
Hey, you have a standard door.

2169
02:15:59,610 --> 02:16:03,870
Let the lady with the fighter commune.
But don't let the reporters come in,

2170
02:16:04,650 --> 02:16:07,950
block everybody outside.
I didn't know what's going to happen.

2171
02:16:07,951 --> 02:16:09,090
I don't want to press.

2172
02:16:10,560 --> 02:16:15,540
So as angel come in with black at
ugly face and attitude and stuff,

2173
02:16:16,200 --> 02:16:17,760
I immediately asked my structure,

2174
02:16:17,800 --> 02:16:22,620
said Lumon grabbed the waiver and
tell him to sign. It's like a,

2175
02:16:22,621 --> 02:16:25,100
if I get hurt,
whatever those waivers.

2176
02:16:25,100 --> 02:16:30,030
And so he looked the waiver we
fugly face and then he spoke with,

2177
02:16:30,050 --> 02:16:35,020
uh, with his guy in Japanese.
And then the Japanese guy said,

2178
02:16:35,021 --> 02:16:39,250
Mr Gracie,
you mean if he don't sign,

2179
02:16:39,280 --> 02:16:40,210
you don't fight?

2180
02:16:41,980 --> 02:16:45,850
Immediately I felt like if
I say, yeah, he has to sign,

2181
02:16:45,970 --> 02:16:49,130
they may leave and they're going to
come in. We followed the excuse, oh,

2182
02:16:49,131 --> 02:16:53,650
he chicken out wherever, la,
la, la. I immediately said, no,

2183
02:16:54,070 --> 02:16:57,730
forget the paper. If you come
into a fight, let's fight.
If I get the bureaucracy,

2184
02:16:57,731 --> 02:17:01,690
let's, let's make something
here more simple. So,

2185
02:17:01,691 --> 02:17:06,300
and then he's, he come into the mat,
should they ring? I, you know, we,

2186
02:17:06,490 --> 02:17:10,150
and we start, you're fighting immediately.

2187
02:17:10,360 --> 02:17:13,330
I felt his intention
to hit me immediately.

2188
02:17:13,331 --> 02:17:18,070
I clinch put him on the ground and
the statue pine she'd done back,

2189
02:17:18,610 --> 02:17:23,590
but different than a normal event where
just put him to sleep or whatever.

2190
02:17:24,400 --> 02:17:29,050
And that particular case I have to
display, showcase his punishment.

2191
02:17:29,260 --> 02:17:31,780
So I was not happy just
to put him to sleep.

2192
02:17:32,530 --> 02:17:35,900
So I start to hear to him and with
their elbow, respect him to time.

2193
02:17:36,100 --> 02:17:41,100
Eventually he don't and I punched him
in the face and two broke his nose and

2194
02:17:41,501 --> 02:17:44,230
make it all bleed,
all cut a cut up.

2195
02:17:45,190 --> 02:17:50,190
And at that point when he felt like I
felt like he was just smash a knife,

2196
02:17:51,100 --> 02:17:56,100
he turned again backwards and I put him
to sleep and then I let him sleeping on

2197
02:17:57,311 --> 02:18:00,880
his own blurred. And then I said to
the, the press and okay now let them in.

2198
02:18:01,420 --> 02:18:05,410
So when the press come in,
saw him passing out,

2199
02:18:05,411 --> 02:18:10,411
waking up with the guy trying to hide
his face from the pictures and the guys

2200
02:18:10,781 --> 02:18:13,390
all Dz waking up, all
blurred, you know, big,

2201
02:18:13,410 --> 02:18:17,200
big mass of blood in the floor and stuff.
And the crowd,

2202
02:18:17,201 --> 02:18:18,850
my students can lift me up,

2203
02:18:18,851 --> 02:18:22,680
I cannot make my tee shirt is all
bloody and I kind of hang on the,

2204
02:18:22,750 --> 02:18:25,960
on the wall like a trophy and
a staff and we all yelling.

2205
02:18:27,230 --> 02:18:32,230
So the guy stood up and left and
then like three or four days later,

2206
02:18:34,271 --> 02:18:38,530
and you'll come back to me and uh,
at the my school I was teaching,

2207
02:18:38,531 --> 02:18:41,350
he called me with a package
and said, oh, I like to talk.

2208
02:18:41,351 --> 02:18:44,870
He was still like all brews and stuff.
So yeah, I like to apologize and,

2209
02:18:45,110 --> 02:18:49,630
and actually give you this as a gift.
And he gives me a Samurai helmet and a,

2210
02:18:49,631 --> 02:18:52,780
and then he laughed to Japan.
And when he got there,

2211
02:18:53,350 --> 02:18:57,670
he say to the crowd, he
was jumped, you know,

2212
02:18:57,671 --> 02:19:01,360
I was John the guys jumped me out a
lot because of the press didn't saw.

2213
02:19:02,170 --> 02:19:04,060
And then I get my,
my assistant,

2214
02:19:04,061 --> 02:19:07,690
my Japanese guy who's working
with me and the valley to the 95.

2215
02:19:08,560 --> 02:19:13,480
And I said, listen, you woody, you
take this tape, you go to Japan,

2216
02:19:13,900 --> 02:19:18,280
make a press conference display,
don't make one copy nothing.

2217
02:19:18,340 --> 02:19:21,340
Make sure no, no plea. So gold there,

2218
02:19:21,341 --> 02:19:25,120
make shoulder depress and come
back and bring this back. Okay.

2219
02:19:25,121 --> 02:19:30,121
So he went make the conference and then
my reputation when they saw was like a

2220
02:19:30,441 --> 02:19:34,740
free for a fair fight. And what
happened, my reputation went to this,

2221
02:19:34,880 --> 02:19:37,200
to the roof. And uh, you know,

2222
02:19:37,201 --> 02:19:41,380
he's just a big step for me and the like
in the publicity because I capitalizing

2223
02:19:41,390 --> 02:19:46,190
all the wrestling, publicity,
which is national in Japan. So,

2224
02:19:46,191 --> 02:19:49,240
and then, then my next fight
eventually was we Staccato,

2225
02:19:49,250 --> 02:19:53,060
he accept the fight and make official
fight and then we create the pride.

2226
02:19:53,480 --> 02:19:56,120
I help in the formulation of the rules.

2227
02:19:56,240 --> 02:19:59,270
A lot of folks don't know that you were
a big part of the original pride. Yeah,

2228
02:19:59,271 --> 02:20:03,530
they asked me if I want to fight the Cada
and for that they want to create a new

2229
02:20:03,531 --> 02:20:08,390
event. I said yes, I fight him and
then we discuss numbers and in,

2230
02:20:08,391 --> 02:20:12,620
in order to make a good rule,
I help in the rules because you know,

2231
02:20:12,640 --> 02:20:17,620
Ken cannot be, so I introduced the Globes
and the MMA and the mixed martial arts.

2232
02:20:17,621 --> 02:20:21,260
And the first one it said that we have
to put gloves because without glue can

2233
02:20:21,261 --> 02:20:24,820
beat your bloody, we have to cut head
butts and stuff. So I make like a,

2234
02:20:24,821 --> 02:20:28,640
a draw of the, the, the
backbone of flood could be.

2235
02:20:28,641 --> 02:20:33,290
And then from that they start the pride
I fought the pride one, the pride for,

2236
02:20:33,291 --> 02:20:38,291
and then the pride becomes like huge
in Japan and then because they have a

2237
02:20:38,481 --> 02:20:43,010
little involvement with the
Coosa uh, the diff, the sponsors,

2238
02:20:43,011 --> 02:20:47,630
they have Fuji TV like pull it off and
they getting problems to, to the payroll,

2239
02:20:47,631 --> 02:20:52,631
which is huge to have maybe
50 top athletes making a
lot of money so they could

2240
02:20:53,541 --> 02:20:54,450
not handle it down.

2241
02:20:54,470 --> 02:20:59,470
UFC come and they go over and get all the
footage and the fighters and now links

2242
02:21:00,070 --> 02:21:00,900
to a next level.

2243
02:21:00,900 --> 02:21:05,610
They took a huge bath cause UFC
page $65 million for pride and all,

2244
02:21:05,620 --> 02:21:08,700
all the contracts were fake.
Yeah. They're all void there.

2245
02:21:08,701 --> 02:21:11,210
There are invalid rather
than none of them were legal.

2246
02:21:11,360 --> 02:21:15,320
So I didn't know that she had the worst
of it. They are weighed the worst of it.

2247
02:21:15,321 --> 02:21:18,310
They tried to sue Japan
or they tried to sue the

2248
02:21:18,500 --> 02:21:20,870
organization.
While it's kind of funny,

2249
02:21:21,080 --> 02:21:26,080
this is how crafty they were
while the UFC purchased a pride,

2250
02:21:26,660 --> 02:21:28,490
the people that were running pride,

2251
02:21:28,491 --> 02:21:31,970
we're starting another organization
while they were working for the UFC.

2252
02:21:32,210 --> 02:21:36,350
So they were working for the UFC, running
the pride offices for the UFC in Japan,

2253
02:21:36,530 --> 02:21:41,060
but then they were running their own
interests is without know, with Disney,

2254
02:21:41,061 --> 02:21:45,050
God of everything. Now there's, there's
a Japanese style, there's a classic,

2255
02:21:45,170 --> 02:21:49,220
there's a classic match or not a
match fight that got, that's on video.

2256
02:21:49,221 --> 02:21:54,080
I might be on youtube with Healon Hugo
Duarte leaving the guy on the beach where

2257
02:21:54,081 --> 02:21:58,100
you guys are fighting. What is that on
Youtube. Oh yeah, yeah. Parts of it.

2258
02:21:58,101 --> 02:22:00,180
It's hard to see the whole thing.
The Gracies action.

2259
02:22:00,760 --> 02:22:04,760
They must fight on the beaches. You know,
who was holding the camera that day?

2260
02:22:04,850 --> 02:22:09,850
Who was highing cousin with 12 years old
and hawks and was seven John John was

2261
02:22:11,271 --> 02:22:14,660
there. There's John Jog
running. So what, what, what,

2262
02:22:14,840 --> 02:22:19,100
what was the reasoning behind that
fight? How did that go down? Okay,

2263
02:22:19,101 --> 02:22:21,950
let's make this the last day.
All right guys, because if not,

2264
02:22:21,951 --> 02:22:25,890
they're going to talk forever. He had
about things from the past you to talk

2265
02:22:26,010 --> 02:22:27,870
about present.
But anyway,

2266
02:22:28,750 --> 02:22:33,750
was a great time because at this point
[inaudible] was just finishing fight.

2267
02:22:34,560 --> 02:22:38,310
Fernando, uh, Fernando Pin Daca.

2268
02:22:38,940 --> 02:22:43,440
And I in a event after my
second fight off Zulu in Maria,

2269
02:22:44,280 --> 02:22:45,113
uh,

2270
02:22:45,120 --> 02:22:49,830
this Jujitsu community has a little
friction with the loot delivery community.

2271
02:22:50,460 --> 02:22:54,390
So they set up a fight between,
uh,

2272
02:22:54,430 --> 02:22:59,070
was Marcel bearing against
a fabulous Molina, uh,

2273
02:22:59,160 --> 02:23:04,160
Hennen against oceanic that deal and
then a pin Duca against Michael Hula.

2274
02:23:05,610 --> 02:23:09,960
And they draw and after
that draw Mako who are,

2275
02:23:10,050 --> 02:23:13,860
creates a good status off being a
great fighter as it is. He's a good,

2276
02:23:14,370 --> 02:23:18,570
you're not tough guy and the
gossip starts, you'll become like,

2277
02:23:18,571 --> 02:23:23,280
uh oh. And then people maybe ask him,
what about Hexion? I said, hey, so,

2278
02:23:24,090 --> 02:23:28,420
and they're kind of small
word is a position where mark,

2279
02:23:28,421 --> 02:23:32,610
who was as willing to fight me.
And I also,

2280
02:23:32,611 --> 02:23:34,080
of course we need to fight him,

2281
02:23:34,560 --> 02:23:39,560
but I don't want to wait or give him the
reputation where I challenge him is not

2282
02:23:40,291 --> 02:23:44,070
the case. He was just the first,
I was already famous, established.

2283
02:23:44,071 --> 02:23:46,980
He was already a coming up.
Like just make a good fight.

2284
02:23:47,790 --> 02:23:52,260
So to make things more simple,
my f my father,

2285
02:23:52,290 --> 02:23:55,530
myself, Marcello, in
Sandra, my best friend,

2286
02:23:55,860 --> 02:23:59,310
we went to his school and
a day and a nighttime,

2287
02:23:59,910 --> 02:24:03,840
he had maybe 50 guys training without Ge.
They all tough.

2288
02:24:03,870 --> 02:24:08,850
They all have a lot of pumping out to
Ireland. So they all big guys, you know.

2289
02:24:10,080 --> 02:24:13,560
So I went to his place, he said,
who is I like to talk to you?

2290
02:24:13,561 --> 02:24:14,940
So he come into me and said,
hey man,

2291
02:24:14,941 --> 02:24:18,870
I heard you use sport you to
showing desire to fight me.

2292
02:24:18,871 --> 02:24:23,190
So I like to fight too. Anytime
you want, regardless, let's do it.

2293
02:24:23,310 --> 02:24:27,390
If you want to do now you can do tomorrow,
whatever. And he look at me and said,

2294
02:24:27,391 --> 02:24:30,660
yeah, but it's not like
that. If you challenge me,

2295
02:24:30,930 --> 02:24:35,520
I may accept but I have, I need
four months to train. I said, man,

2296
02:24:35,521 --> 02:24:39,630
you crazy. You think like
I, I use all the names.

2297
02:24:39,631 --> 02:24:42,000
But it's like you think the Lakers,

2298
02:24:42,001 --> 02:24:45,420
we challenge a college
basketball team from,

2299
02:24:45,421 --> 02:24:49,680
from from Cucamonga, right? Fuck man.

2300
02:24:49,830 --> 02:24:52,250
What you're talking about, you've
come here to Charlie. I'd met,

2301
02:24:52,530 --> 02:24:56,430
I come here too because I heard you
planning to fight and if you find here you

2302
02:24:56,431 --> 02:25:00,690
want to fight or not. So when this
conversation statue become a little,

2303
02:25:01,410 --> 02:25:05,290
my dad called me has a a
mediator and said, hey guys
don't, don't want to discuss,

2304
02:25:05,670 --> 02:25:09,120
let's make a list if
somebody wants to fight.

2305
02:25:09,170 --> 02:25:14,170
So let's make a list and then eventually
you guys can can fight and then we'll

2306
02:25:14,561 --> 02:25:19,240
go from the back. Yeah, you can
put my name on that list and I,

2307
02:25:19,470 --> 02:25:23,390
first time I saw her in my life and I look
at him, I said, yeah man, you tell me I,

2308
02:25:23,770 --> 02:25:27,700
this is not a, because has a game, a
gambling in Brazil, like a popular game,

2309
02:25:27,701 --> 02:25:32,701
not official but unofficial game called
Juggle to be shoe means game off the

2310
02:25:32,771 --> 02:25:37,180
animals. You put a name, a
number, like a 24 is the,

2311
02:25:37,420 --> 02:25:38,253
is the deer.

2312
02:25:38,590 --> 02:25:43,590
So a guy put a $1 and if he wins again
maybe $50 something very popular at every

2313
02:25:44,501 --> 02:25:48,280
in every corner has this kind of
underground game. And I said to him,

2314
02:25:48,281 --> 02:25:51,640
this is not a game of animals, man.
This is just a seat as business.

2315
02:25:52,030 --> 02:25:54,250
You don't have to put your name in
the least. If you want to fight,

2316
02:25:54,251 --> 02:25:57,820
let's fight right now. And the guy
kind of get me noodle, confused,

2317
02:25:57,821 --> 02:26:00,970
sows and nothing happened.
And then we decide to leave.

2318
02:26:00,971 --> 02:26:05,740
So we left after that,
the whole Gospel,

2319
02:26:05,770 --> 02:26:10,730
every corner I heard Uga was
straining to fight you. Woo.

2320
02:26:10,780 --> 02:26:12,920
Start to force talking about woo.

2321
02:26:13,990 --> 02:26:16,630
And I felt like this has to have an end.

2322
02:26:16,660 --> 02:26:21,100
You know another guy who
could not challenge officially
because he's a nobody,

2323
02:26:21,640 --> 02:26:25,870
but he's the guy who if I just disregard
is something we're going to be against

2324
02:26:25,871 --> 02:26:29,530
me too, because I know he has
the potential. He's a fighter,

2325
02:26:30,250 --> 02:26:33,370
he just don't have the name.
But he's a legitimate tough guy.

2326
02:26:34,030 --> 02:26:35,950
So based on that,

2327
02:26:35,951 --> 02:26:40,390
I could not just ignore and I
could not challenge him officially.

2328
02:26:40,391 --> 02:26:43,870
So I have to do something in between
which fight him on the street.

2329
02:26:45,340 --> 02:26:49,780
So we decided to find a final, okay,
let's make a profile where he goes,

2330
02:26:49,781 --> 02:26:53,320
what beats you go where he walks
about. So we decided, well,

2331
02:26:53,321 --> 02:26:57,780
he goes into this beach was a very
popular beach and in real every Sunday,

2332
02:26:57,790 --> 02:26:59,740
every Saturday, Sunday
is there with the, okay,

2333
02:26:59,741 --> 02:27:02,110
so next Sunday we want
to be there Saturday.

2334
02:27:04,180 --> 02:27:07,660
So I was at this point,

2335
02:27:07,900 --> 02:27:11,660
separate from my, my
relationship, I was living like a,

2336
02:27:11,690 --> 02:27:15,690
a single in real and that's very
hard to do because a lot of options.

2337
02:27:16,640 --> 02:27:20,950
So, so I was not concerned
about the fight at all.

2338
02:27:21,280 --> 02:27:25,540
I was no sleep on the Monday,
Tuesday,

2339
02:27:25,541 --> 02:27:29,650
like just going Pyree a lot,
wake up on Wednesday,

2340
02:27:29,651 --> 02:27:34,360
kind of afternoon walk on his street,
close to my neighborhood.

2341
02:27:34,660 --> 02:27:38,530
And then I saw a friend of mine who
is always in the gossip said, hey,

2342
02:27:39,130 --> 02:27:40,390
as a living home,
I said,

2343
02:27:40,391 --> 02:27:43,390
I think I'm going to postpone who
was fight for the following week.

2344
02:27:43,870 --> 02:27:47,140
I don't think it's going to be a good
idea because man, I'm just too much party

2345
02:27:51,310 --> 02:27:55,900
when I get on the street. Men, first
time my first guy I saw it was this,

2346
02:27:55,901 --> 02:27:59,620
my friend Bodu who's just
come in and said, man,

2347
02:27:59,621 --> 02:28:03,040
you should see the everybody's spread.
Bet everybody if talking about the fight,

2348
02:28:03,041 --> 02:28:06,910
that would be great. They
are waiting, they all will be
there. And I say, Oh my God,

2349
02:28:06,911 --> 02:28:10,990
no postponement anymore. I
have to go regardless. So,

2350
02:28:12,610 --> 02:28:17,320
so as I approached the weekend, I
try to just recover, sleep, eat well,

2351
02:28:17,321 --> 02:28:20,320
but still like not enough.
Anyway.

2352
02:28:22,130 --> 02:28:22,671
Uh,

2353
02:28:22,671 --> 02:28:27,320
Saturday morning we all gathering
in the end the Gracie Baha Academy,

2354
02:28:27,321 --> 02:28:32,270
which is close to the neighborhood. And,
and uh, we guarantee like the students,

2355
02:28:32,271 --> 02:28:35,780
because we have to have a team
shoe to be there, you know,

2356
02:28:35,781 --> 02:28:36,980
what you hold and whatever.

2357
02:28:36,981 --> 02:28:41,690
So it's about 50 to 60 guys there and
we all kind of strategizing, okay,

2358
02:28:41,691 --> 02:28:44,840
you guys make this and that.
And um,

2359
02:28:45,950 --> 02:28:49,190
and then my son was seven years old,
old pumping up and down,

2360
02:28:49,191 --> 02:28:52,430
and one point everybody quiet. He's
just jumping the middle. I said, yeah,

2361
02:28:52,720 --> 02:28:55,970
and if he son will be dead,
I gonna kick his ass. I said,

2362
02:28:58,970 --> 02:29:02,960
so he's already with the DNA
of the battle. So it was funny.

2363
02:29:03,560 --> 02:29:07,270
And then eventually about 10 o'clock or
so, he arrive on the beach. The guide,

2364
02:29:07,271 --> 02:29:09,320
the message icon is age.
They are. They're so,

2365
02:29:09,350 --> 02:29:13,760
so you went to the beach and as we
approached the beach, I have the camera.

2366
02:29:13,770 --> 02:29:16,100
Nobody wants to hold the
cam. No, no, no, not me.

2367
02:29:16,340 --> 02:29:20,930
So I give the camera too high and which
is 12 years old at the time and he could

2368
02:29:20,931 --> 02:29:23,210
not get through is just yelling.

2369
02:29:23,211 --> 02:29:25,820
Everybody who could not get
through to film the fight.

2370
02:29:25,890 --> 02:29:27,560
The funeral is not even important.

2371
02:29:27,561 --> 02:29:32,561
So we engage was a at the moment
the first engage after a slap him,

2372
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:38,930
Eh, we engage very quickly and
then we start to house on the sand.

2373
02:29:38,931 --> 02:29:42,590
He fall on top of me.
I was kind of having a hard time from,

2374
02:29:42,591 --> 02:29:45,050
from the beginning and
then able to sweep mounted

2375
02:29:46,580 --> 02:29:51,320
and he escaped from the Mt. One more
time because the scent giving me no bs.

2376
02:29:51,321 --> 02:29:55,070
So I kind of mass my knee on the sand.
So he come up,

2377
02:29:55,820 --> 02:29:59,540
I have to sweep him again.
Mounted again that time.

2378
02:29:59,541 --> 02:30:04,250
Much more concern of keeping the position.
So I grabbed his hand like,

2379
02:30:04,340 --> 02:30:08,750
like from the back and I started
punching him like a full Inaki.

2380
02:30:09,010 --> 02:30:12,560
Yeah, exactly. Like flank at sash touch
with punching him, punching, elbow, punch,

2381
02:30:12,561 --> 02:30:16,280
batch, punch, punch. And then at
one point I was dead, dead tired.

2382
02:30:17,090 --> 02:30:21,530
I asked him, you want to give up? He said,
you have to kill me. I said, okay, mother.

2383
02:30:21,860 --> 02:30:26,330
Boom, punching, punching,
punch. And then immediately
afterwards he says, okay, stop,

2384
02:30:26,331 --> 02:30:28,160
stop, stop. So I immediately stopped.

2385
02:30:28,940 --> 02:30:33,470
We went to the water dive on the water
has come back as we come back. He said,

2386
02:30:33,471 --> 02:30:36,620
yeah, I'm not happy. I said, okay, let's
do it again. Said, no, no, not today.

2387
02:30:37,730 --> 02:30:40,440
And I said, okay man. That's
okay. And then how's with state?

2388
02:30:40,441 --> 02:30:43,900
You're fighting you my cell.
Mandy's at the beach, they start,

2389
02:30:43,901 --> 02:30:44,734
you're getting it down.

2390
02:30:44,740 --> 02:30:49,450
It doesn't have the end is just
kind of mess it up a little bit.

2391
02:30:49,490 --> 02:30:54,140
Hanzo confront with the guy, but
it was not a hand fight. Anyway.

2392
02:30:54,770 --> 02:30:59,210
I put stitches on my hand and a back,
like all swallow my hands,

2393
02:30:59,211 --> 02:31:03,530
all swallows. So I went back home,
training, resting, giving my life.

2394
02:31:04,040 --> 02:31:08,520
One week later, you know, I
wasn't apart. A friend of mine,

2395
02:31:08,521 --> 02:31:10,130
his apartment,
you know,

2396
02:31:10,670 --> 02:31:14,150
resting tired from some little fun.

2397
02:31:14,510 --> 02:31:19,350
I was lay down,
you know in my underwears my hair,

2398
02:31:19,351 --> 02:31:20,670
I have long hair at the time,

2399
02:31:20,671 --> 02:31:25,350
but all Massey a guy who my student of
mine just stop in the bend, the on the,

2400
02:31:25,351 --> 02:31:27,300
on the street on the bike and said,

2401
02:31:27,301 --> 02:31:31,450
hey Exxon Hexion day inviting the
school is invading is a big invasion.

2402
02:31:31,480 --> 02:31:36,480
I said I kind of wake up in the run down
and when he saw me running underwears

2403
02:31:37,110 --> 02:31:39,810
you go like that and said hey man,
I jumped in the bike, let's go.

2404
02:31:39,811 --> 02:31:43,440
So I went to the,
to my school in your underwear,

2405
02:31:43,510 --> 02:31:48,150
in my underwear with the hair. All crazy
things to be animated by the way. Right.

2406
02:31:49,680 --> 02:31:53,640
And I, and as a approach the, the school,

2407
02:31:54,810 --> 02:31:58,860
because they come in from a
different neighborhood walking and,

2408
02:31:59,180 --> 02:32:03,120
and one of the guys like [inaudible]
was a black guy who lives in a ghetto

2409
02:32:04,940 --> 02:32:09,260
as they approached the Comey walk if
maybe five, three or four miles, you know,

2410
02:32:09,261 --> 02:32:10,970
something like that to a
different neighborhood.

2411
02:32:10,971 --> 02:32:12,230
They coming like from the street.

2412
02:32:12,530 --> 02:32:17,530
That's breakout hustle as they coming
like cause not only fighters as bad guys

2413
02:32:17,631 --> 02:32:22,340
guys, we like all the ice. I
mean only the co uncover eyes.

2414
02:32:22,341 --> 02:32:25,580
We've with guns,
with knives we've bottled break.

2415
02:32:25,820 --> 02:32:29,450
So it's a lot of covert actions,
a lot of average bed energy.

2416
02:32:29,451 --> 02:32:33,830
Not coming from a real fight situation
but it's more like a street dangerous.

2417
02:32:34,490 --> 02:32:37,640
So as I approach and I
come in through the crowd,

2418
02:32:38,060 --> 02:32:41,570
which is already controlling
maybe two thirds of the street,

2419
02:32:41,571 --> 02:32:45,260
which paint passing cars just
could not pass in cars anymore.

2420
02:32:45,261 --> 02:32:48,110
It's just like just the car
passing and a very fine line.

2421
02:32:48,111 --> 02:32:52,310
It's a big crowd in front of the school.
So I went through with the bike.

2422
02:32:52,850 --> 02:32:57,410
When I coming up to the school,
he's already coming down with my father,

2423
02:32:57,980 --> 02:33:02,570
the new song, which his a struct or
other guys. They coming down and we,

2424
02:33:02,750 --> 02:33:06,290
we kind of crush each other. And
in the middle of this, the stairs,

2425
02:33:06,291 --> 02:33:08,120
I said okay man, let's
go down, let's talk.

2426
02:33:08,121 --> 02:33:13,121
So we can went down to the parking lot
and like crowded maybe 20 guys from my

2427
02:33:14,871 --> 02:33:17,690
school.
One guy has a weapon,

2428
02:33:18,020 --> 02:33:22,460
but the other guys may be five or
six, 10 guns and knife. I mean,

2429
02:33:22,880 --> 02:33:27,590
he's a bad, bad weather, you know.
So before I start the fight, I said,

2430
02:33:27,620 --> 02:33:32,600
Ooh, I like to talk to you.
Come over, let's talk. Let's
walk to the backyard here.

2431
02:33:33,140 --> 02:33:34,940
So my father and myself,

2432
02:33:34,970 --> 02:33:38,750
the new Song Heuler and
the Oceania to deal,

2433
02:33:38,780 --> 02:33:43,070
we kind of move away from the crowd that
you were like a backyard. And I said,

2434
02:33:43,071 --> 02:33:45,740
man, I want to talk to you.
Something very important. Listen,

2435
02:33:46,700 --> 02:33:50,740
I fought to you last week
as a man and I come here,

2436
02:33:50,770 --> 02:33:55,550
I respect you as a fighter to challenge
me to rematch. So all of this, the school,

2437
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:57,620
regardless who, when, who lost.

2438
02:33:58,490 --> 02:34:02,360
But if somebody touched the
fight before the fight is over,

2439
02:34:02,690 --> 02:34:06,020
because you bring here a lot of
people without no martial arts code.

2440
02:34:06,890 --> 02:34:10,340
So if somebody touches the fight before
it was over, I guarantee you, man,

2441
02:34:10,820 --> 02:34:14,810
you wake up on the ditch.
And he said, no, no,

2442
02:34:14,811 --> 02:34:18,730
he's a man meant you man. There's a spice
as the owner thinks, okay, let's go back.

2443
02:34:18,731 --> 02:34:22,000
Let's talk finish books.
So we went back to the crowd,

2444
02:34:22,570 --> 02:34:27,570
they make a a Rina like
people make a real uh,

2445
02:34:27,790 --> 02:34:30,340
circle and was on the concrete

2446
02:34:31,870 --> 02:34:33,960
and I felt when we start it,

2447
02:34:34,150 --> 02:34:38,650
I felt like his mentor or whatever
she was supposed to say to him,

2448
02:34:38,651 --> 02:34:42,310
hey man, the first fight last
week, you engage too quickly,

2449
02:34:42,311 --> 02:34:44,740
you give the grappling to,
you should punch him in the face.

2450
02:34:45,040 --> 02:34:49,780
So I felt a completely different animal
because he was already trying to buy his

2451
02:34:49,781 --> 02:34:52,090
approach, his position,
he's the way he moves.

2452
02:34:52,091 --> 02:34:57,091
I felt like he wants to punch me different
than was before and I kind of make

2453
02:34:57,611 --> 02:35:00,190
myself like available.
I kind of played dummy,

2454
02:35:00,191 --> 02:35:02,940
you know like play kind
of stretch and he come in,

2455
02:35:02,950 --> 02:35:07,810
punch me right that I deflected very
quick, grab him around the waist,

2456
02:35:07,811 --> 02:35:08,644
like high,

2457
02:35:08,980 --> 02:35:13,240
make a little hip movement and put him
on his own and throw him on the concrete.

2458
02:35:13,960 --> 02:35:17,860
So He fell flat on the concrete.
I tried to mount hitch escape,

2459
02:35:17,890 --> 02:35:22,890
I move like to the other side and mount
again and I ended up by mountain on him.

2460
02:35:23,260 --> 02:35:27,760
Like we're 15 maybe 20 seconds
I use is mounted on him.

2461
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:31,510
I punch the cover up and
I could not punch anymore.

2462
02:35:31,511 --> 02:35:35,590
So I get his everything and Bang his
head against the concrete few times.

2463
02:35:36,280 --> 02:35:40,690
You're not going to bang their head on
the floor and then he's soft it up a

2464
02:35:40,691 --> 02:35:44,050
little bee. I give them a couple of pints.
He kind of quit immediately. Stop, stop,

2465
02:35:44,051 --> 02:35:44,884
stopped.

2466
02:35:45,460 --> 02:35:49,090
For me it was not exactly the well
done job because it was just too quick.

2467
02:35:49,150 --> 02:35:52,090
And he, he, he quit. He quit very quickly.

2468
02:35:52,960 --> 02:35:57,190
So I want to do something else.
But the crowd was already trying to,

2469
02:35:57,880 --> 02:36:02,480
it's too much. I said, if
I insist here after his Rx,

2470
02:36:02,530 --> 02:36:07,180
ask for mercy can jeopardize the whole
thing. So even though I was not happy,

2471
02:36:07,660 --> 02:36:11,260
I stood up and he stood up and
he said, yeah man, I'm happy.

2472
02:36:11,261 --> 02:36:15,100
I'm satisfied now he would really
demand shake your hands, said yeah man,

2473
02:36:15,101 --> 02:36:18,070
you have a very valuable guide shoe
with very strong keep training,

2474
02:36:18,071 --> 02:36:22,920
you can be good. So we kind of
ended up our it, our our different,

2475
02:36:23,270 --> 02:36:27,410
yes. So once we out of
that highly statue, uh,

2476
02:36:28,370 --> 02:36:32,830
highly start to fight the urogenital
deal in the same because they are already

2477
02:36:32,860 --> 02:36:36,640
having a little, so they start, you're
fighting at that point the police come in,

2478
02:36:37,300 --> 02:36:40,960
a guy with a gun machine just because
nobody would listen to possess is nothing.

2479
02:36:40,961 --> 02:36:44,590
So he cannot make a shooting.
The the roof,

2480
02:36:45,010 --> 02:36:47,020
the bullets come up and breaking some,

2481
02:36:47,021 --> 02:36:51,280
some Rico shit down and somebody
get hit and then he come,

2482
02:36:51,281 --> 02:36:53,910
he was very small guy with a
cigarette and said, hey, why not?

2483
02:36:53,920 --> 02:36:55,660
See who is the tough guy now,
now.

2484
02:36:55,661 --> 02:36:59,500
And so it's like very small guy for gum
machine. So he knew everybody like quiet.

2485
02:37:00,280 --> 02:37:02,170
So, and then I talked with
the new said, hey man,

2486
02:37:02,171 --> 02:37:05,710
the fight is just start here with hydro
has to go next week we're going to set

2487
02:37:05,711 --> 02:37:09,220
up something that's not Andy
and said, yeah, that's all we,

2488
02:37:09,330 --> 02:37:13,360
we set up for a different
day when then is over for me,

2489
02:37:13,361 --> 02:37:16,040
we and what we kind end up with

2490
02:37:16,040 --> 02:37:20,380
are respectful, honorable way and
uh, that's pretty much it. That's it.

2491
02:37:20,450 --> 02:37:23,600
Great Story. No more
old stories. That's it.

2492
02:37:24,550 --> 02:37:28,500
Because there are those all night. We
can go forever here man. Some guys,

2493
02:37:29,430 --> 02:37:33,170
you know, this is the biggest response
ever on Twitter for a gas. Like,

2494
02:37:33,350 --> 02:37:34,400
I don't know about your Twitter,

2495
02:37:34,401 --> 02:37:37,970
but my Twitter people are going
nuts that you're doing the podcast.

2496
02:37:38,180 --> 02:37:41,840
People are losing their minds and they've
been going nuts ever since the Yohji

2497
02:37:41,840 --> 02:37:46,490
Angelo tape. There's screaming, please
release the tape, please release the tape.

2498
02:37:47,150 --> 02:37:50,270
Will you release it?
Yeah, let's do that. Oh,

2499
02:37:51,930 --> 02:37:54,590
the couple of million people in the site.

2500
02:37:54,980 --> 02:37:57,540
We'll do our best to get
as many people on the site.

2501
02:37:58,450 --> 02:38:02,960
Where are you sending people? What's the
site? What's the address? Jay Jay g f.com.

2502
02:38:03,770 --> 02:38:07,670
Global Federation that call.
So just the initial J J G f.com.

2503
02:38:07,710 --> 02:38:09,590
It's all set up right now.
Beautiful.

2504
02:38:09,770 --> 02:38:12,380
So I wanted to ask you something
about what's going on today

2505
02:38:12,460 --> 02:38:14,360
in MMA.
There's like,

2506
02:38:14,361 --> 02:38:18,520
like Nick Diaz and there's been a
bunch of guys that have been, uh,

2507
02:38:18,620 --> 02:38:23,000
suspended and fine for having
a cannabis in their system.

2508
02:38:23,300 --> 02:38:27,290
And there's big controversy because in a
lot of states now it's 23 states in the

2509
02:38:27,291 --> 02:38:28,790
United States where it's legal now.

2510
02:38:29,240 --> 02:38:34,240
So how do you feel about a banning
cannabis as a performance enhancer?

2511
02:38:34,641 --> 02:38:39,170
Do you think? I mean, what do you, what do
you think about it man? I think, you know,

2512
02:38:39,171 --> 02:38:41,300
we are,
I mean the,

2513
02:38:41,840 --> 02:38:46,840
the beginning of the Times drugs are
always involved with was not dressed drugs

2514
02:38:47,120 --> 02:38:51,200
for body drugs or, or let's I
totally talking about painkillers.

2515
02:38:51,201 --> 02:38:55,700
We talking about coffee, we talking
about alcohol, we talking about, I mean,

2516
02:38:56,000 --> 02:39:00,550
Geez and Arabs and so we all luck.
Wish to meet you use medicines and drugs.

2517
02:39:00,551 --> 02:39:05,060
Tween. Hey. Should diminish
to account too. So this is,

2518
02:39:05,080 --> 02:39:09,950
is, is, is there, you know, I think, uh,

2519
02:39:09,980 --> 02:39:14,390
that kind of judgment goes from
person to person from, you know,

2520
02:39:14,391 --> 02:39:19,391
some people can have a little bit of some
drug and get a reaction which can make

2521
02:39:19,851 --> 02:39:23,390
him crazy or can make him
addicted or can hate him.

2522
02:39:23,810 --> 02:39:27,500
So the chemical in the brain
can respond differently. Yes.

2523
02:39:27,560 --> 02:39:30,650
For some people can I bust as a medicine,

2524
02:39:30,950 --> 02:39:35,120
as they play fight all this can be
a stimulant or it can be uh, uh,

2525
02:39:35,390 --> 02:39:40,280
below. I mean low yourself. Steam becomes
bipolar. If you smoke, you can be,

2526
02:39:40,580 --> 02:39:42,230
I mean,
I mean you don't know.

2527
02:39:42,980 --> 02:39:46,820
It makes you more of what you are kind
of right there. It's hard to say what is.

2528
02:39:46,850 --> 02:39:51,620
So and that point I feel like we
have to obey the law, you know?

2529
02:39:51,621 --> 02:39:55,460
And if, if some kind of
drugs are forbidden by law,

2530
02:39:56,060 --> 02:39:59,390
for you to become a proact athlete,
you have to obey that.

2531
02:39:59,690 --> 02:40:03,290
If we not with Korea and what
you're doing in your life, you know,

2532
02:40:03,291 --> 02:40:06,260
it has to be respected. It
has to be, you know, whatever.

2533
02:40:06,261 --> 02:40:10,040
But what's the rules for MMA?
I mean,

2534
02:40:10,041 --> 02:40:14,220
I try to input in the Jujitsu,
the anti-doping, you know,

2535
02:40:14,280 --> 02:40:17,160
because you'll see guys
in the same way division,

2536
02:40:17,190 --> 02:40:20,910
but one guy has 10 times more,
10 times more power,

2537
02:40:20,911 --> 02:40:25,620
10 times or so. And the guys that you
know has the addictive, like he has a,

2538
02:40:25,640 --> 02:40:30,640
an extra I extra iin Haysman so we have
to balance this in art in order to make

2539
02:40:32,851 --> 02:40:37,500
a fair sport. How much they
can I be is affect the athlete.

2540
02:40:37,560 --> 02:40:42,560
I'm not sure you know and but I know
audits like steroids or hormones,

2541
02:40:42,900 --> 02:40:47,900
those are proving so whatever is being
proved against use the cannabis for

2542
02:40:51,480 --> 02:40:54,150
fighting for e sports activities.

2543
02:40:54,510 --> 02:40:57,840
If it's proved this kind of support of,

2544
02:40:58,090 --> 02:41:02,550
I mean the drug use can be in hasting
center. Maybe we could, I don't know.

2545
02:41:02,580 --> 02:41:05,490
It's up to the prognosis.
It's, it's their,

2546
02:41:05,500 --> 02:41:09,000
they're testing people for something
that stays in your body for a long time

2547
02:41:09,001 --> 02:41:13,080
after its psychoactive. So if you took
cannabis like a week before your fight,

2548
02:41:13,320 --> 02:41:15,840
you're not going to be high when you're
fighting but it's still going to be in

2549
02:41:15,841 --> 02:41:16,350
your system.

2550
02:41:16,350 --> 02:41:19,800
So you're still going to be penalized
for something that has like what's the

2551
02:41:19,801 --> 02:41:22,440
reason? What's the reason
why they took it? Yeah.

2552
02:41:22,441 --> 02:41:26,870
Because you can have caffeine in
your blood, you can have like a,

2553
02:41:26,890 --> 02:41:30,090
another kind of why
the cannabis has to be,

2554
02:41:30,480 --> 02:41:32,560
because I don't think he's in haste.

2555
02:41:32,561 --> 02:41:36,560
Mint of performance I think
is only control your emotion.

2556
02:41:36,561 --> 02:41:40,650
Emotional give you kind of some kind of
feeling of happiness sometimes even give

2557
02:41:40,651 --> 02:41:43,050
you like a little laziness,
you know?

2558
02:41:43,051 --> 02:41:47,070
I don't think that's what will help
you as an athlete. I think if you get,

2559
02:41:47,160 --> 02:41:51,510
if you get high before event, you're gonna
lose your sharpness. You're going to,

2560
02:41:51,720 --> 02:41:54,000
so I don't think that's will support.

2561
02:41:54,390 --> 02:41:59,140
So I don't see why they have to bother
in legalizing or four beats. I Dunno.

2562
02:41:59,190 --> 02:42:02,700
Maybe it's just because of the law,
just because it's illegal.

2563
02:42:02,701 --> 02:42:05,820
And the reason why it's
illegal has nothing to do
with whether or not it's safe

2564
02:42:05,821 --> 02:42:09,170
or dangerous. Does nothing. It's
all political at this point. So,

2565
02:42:09,300 --> 02:42:12,840
but they did lower it right now.
It used to be in a few of you,

2566
02:42:13,770 --> 02:42:16,410
if you were in Colorado, let's
say, where it's totally legal,

2567
02:42:16,411 --> 02:42:18,990
it's not illegal there.
Anybody can smoke in Colorado.

2568
02:42:18,991 --> 02:42:21,030
You could buy it and you could buy it.
And vending machines,

2569
02:42:21,540 --> 02:42:25,020
you have to stop a month
before your fight because it's,

2570
02:42:25,090 --> 02:42:27,870
it's still going to show up in the
test and you could lose the fight,

2571
02:42:27,871 --> 02:42:31,200
the fight to no contest. You've
get fine. So now they're,

2572
02:42:31,201 --> 02:42:35,040
they're kind of changing it
and adapting now I guess, uh,

2573
02:42:35,190 --> 02:42:38,370
according to the numbers
I think you can go,

2574
02:42:38,850 --> 02:42:43,800
you have to stop two weeks before a fight
or something like that. So, um, yeah,

2575
02:42:43,810 --> 02:42:45,070
maybe eventually,

2576
02:42:45,130 --> 02:42:49,710
depending on the card they have to
change the fight for Colorado. Yeah.

2577
02:42:49,980 --> 02:42:54,720
So the training camp be in, in
Colorado, so everything that is legal,

2578
02:42:55,050 --> 02:42:59,480
but there were, there
are there definitely. Uh,

2579
02:43:00,070 --> 02:43:03,810
well, how do you say relaxing? The rules
are, or he wouldn't say that though.

2580
02:43:03,811 --> 02:43:05,820
What do they,
what's the word he made it from a,

2581
02:43:05,821 --> 02:43:10,740
used to be 50 nanograms
per milliliter to 150.

2582
02:43:10,900 --> 02:43:13,300
So it changed quite a bit.
300% increase.

2583
02:43:13,540 --> 02:43:16,570
So you have to have 300% more
marijuana in your system.

2584
02:43:17,320 --> 02:43:21,580
That's a step in the right direction.
Now, as far as performance enhancing,

2585
02:43:21,700 --> 02:43:26,290
surfing is a serious sport that
requires serious technique,

2586
02:43:26,291 --> 02:43:29,810
lots of hours. And generally you, you,

2587
02:43:29,860 --> 02:43:34,600
you hear that surfers will be under
the influence of cannabis while they're

2588
02:43:34,601 --> 02:43:39,310
surfing. Um, Eh, it wouldn't, it if it,

2589
02:43:39,370 --> 02:43:42,390
if it doesn't, makes your reflex is
some people believe that it makes,

2590
02:43:42,410 --> 02:43:46,920
it's a dulls your reflexes.
How can surfers, uh,

2591
02:43:47,950 --> 02:43:51,920
be under the influence of cannabis
and ride a 25 foot wave? No,

2592
02:43:52,220 --> 02:43:56,840
the, the, the way the ocean is, um,

2593
02:43:57,530 --> 02:44:02,150
he's an animal, you know, he's alive
is in movement. These can be dangerous.

2594
02:44:02,480 --> 02:44:06,410
Has this kind of,
you have to have the perfect lecture.

2595
02:44:06,670 --> 02:44:09,440
[inaudible] you have to
have it to Beth mapping

2596
02:44:09,920 --> 02:44:12,840
the way out, the way in. So
He's a lot of strategies,

2597
02:44:12,860 --> 02:44:16,940
a lot of technique and is also,
is a lot of Armani between

2598
02:44:18,630 --> 02:44:20,550
you as a surfer in the ocean.

2599
02:44:21,300 --> 02:44:24,390
So you have to find yourself comfortable.

2600
02:44:24,600 --> 02:44:28,650
You have to find herself disputed
to be connect to the force.

2601
02:44:29,550 --> 02:44:32,750
And sometimes some of guys who,

2602
02:44:32,820 --> 02:44:37,380
my friends who kind of
normally, uh, smoke some,

2603
02:44:38,070 --> 02:44:41,610
they feel peaceful and they
get in the Armani. He's not,

2604
02:44:41,640 --> 02:44:45,870
he's not about Stan News, uh, physical.

2605
02:44:46,810 --> 02:44:50,620
The only if you get caught in the bad
situation, I guess the bad report,

2606
02:44:50,650 --> 02:44:53,800
you have to swim like a dog. You're a good
surfer. You've served your whole lives,

2607
02:44:53,801 --> 02:44:57,310
right. So for my whole life, what's the
biggest way of you've ever served 38?

2608
02:44:57,420 --> 02:45:00,570
No ma'am. No ma'am. I'm
a, I'm about 12 feet.

2609
02:45:01,760 --> 02:45:05,300
Dangerous. Longboard shortboard
shortboard okay. I'm a short board. Yes.

2610
02:45:05,390 --> 02:45:08,420
And crone serves to grow surfs,
but he is just,

2611
02:45:08,510 --> 02:45:12,020
he is more passionate about Jujitsu then,
then surf.

2612
02:45:12,630 --> 02:45:16,850
Surf still. Oh, depends on swell. I
have to check her for lunch today.

2613
02:45:17,260 --> 02:45:19,550
Oh really?
Yeah.

2614
02:45:22,160 --> 02:45:26,600
Oh yeah man. What is it
about surfing is about? Uh,

2615
02:45:26,810 --> 02:45:27,700
for me is mod.

2616
02:45:27,700 --> 02:45:31,430
The water, the ocean.
Because I believe in energy.

2617
02:45:31,790 --> 02:45:35,840
I believe in, uh, in the
ocean being the most,

2618
02:45:35,870 --> 02:45:36,830
the most,

2619
02:45:36,860 --> 02:45:41,860
the hugest and electromagnetic Paul
in art or the electricity coming from.

2620
02:45:42,381 --> 02:45:46,430
So as I go in the ocean, if
I'm stressed, I get energy.

2621
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:51,320
If I'm, you know, lazy, I
get energy. If I'm to tests,

2622
02:45:51,321 --> 02:45:52,740
I get relaxed.
So He's,

2623
02:45:52,741 --> 02:45:57,741
I equalize it for me because I feel like
the contact with the ocean keep me in

2624
02:45:57,831 --> 02:45:58,880
balance.
Keep me.

2625
02:45:59,480 --> 02:46:03,890
So for me it's not about the perfect
waves about going to the ocean and make my

2626
02:46:03,891 --> 02:46:07,940
routine, make my exercise breathing.
You know, I'm a tropical rat.

2627
02:46:07,941 --> 02:46:12,941
I'm born and raised in so I cannot
stay away from the water is just,

2628
02:46:13,880 --> 02:46:18,090
you know, somehow the energy flow
in the Holy Spirit spiritually.

2629
02:46:18,120 --> 02:46:23,120
That's kind of have empower me in a
sense that you would say that physically

2630
02:46:23,780 --> 02:46:26,780
surfing does translate to Jujitsu
as far as the balance, right,

2631
02:46:26,781 --> 02:46:31,570
because you need incredible balance. Not
really. I think a, it is of course you,

2632
02:46:31,571 --> 02:46:32,960
you stimulates your yard,

2633
02:46:33,350 --> 02:46:37,850
your neural muscular activity in
surfing and skate and, and Juju.

2634
02:46:38,300 --> 02:46:39,410
But uh,

2635
02:46:39,500 --> 02:46:44,500
I think the most important thing in
surfing is as you become under pressure,

2636
02:46:46,070 --> 02:46:49,880
you have to strategize. You have
to be in control of your emotions.

2637
02:46:49,910 --> 02:46:54,910
You have to be a focus
in and everything due,

2638
02:46:55,221 --> 02:46:59,900
right? And if things go wrong, you have
to be fine. Your comfortable zone in hell.

2639
02:47:00,560 --> 02:47:01,990
And that's the mindset.

2640
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:05,660
The similar because the
ocean is not the only enemy,

2641
02:47:06,410 --> 02:47:09,950
but he's there to do his
tank and is very powerful.

2642
02:47:09,951 --> 02:47:13,700
So you have to find her,
your mentor, your mindset,

2643
02:47:13,701 --> 02:47:17,270
you'll find confortable in
all of this turmoil, you know,

2644
02:47:17,271 --> 02:47:22,150
is all you know is if you get quite in
a wrong position and if you get panic is

2645
02:47:22,160 --> 02:47:25,220
gone. So you have to be
calm. Same thing than fight.

2646
02:47:25,490 --> 02:47:30,110
You have to have like the focus, the
strategy and uh, even when things,

2647
02:47:30,111 --> 02:47:33,170
when the problem arises
you have to be in control.

2648
02:47:33,230 --> 02:47:34,720
What do you do with your time these days?

2649
02:47:34,730 --> 02:47:38,810
Like what's a typical
day for Hixon Gracie? Um,

2650
02:47:38,870 --> 02:47:43,160
right now I backed, should teach and
cross place because I want to, to,

2651
02:47:43,760 --> 02:47:47,990
to have him dees, distress
with the, how the academy goes.

2652
02:47:47,991 --> 02:47:50,210
So I pick two times a week to teach.

2653
02:47:50,211 --> 02:47:55,211
They're giving selfdefence
glasses at this point.

2654
02:47:55,551 --> 02:48:00,551
Before that I was doing seminars
once a month at the most,

2655
02:48:01,371 --> 02:48:06,371
once or twice every couple
of months to make my living.

2656
02:48:06,920 --> 02:48:10,910
And also because I feel like
the best things in life,

2657
02:48:10,911 --> 02:48:15,870
money cannot buy. And I feel
like the quality of my, my,

2658
02:48:15,970 --> 02:48:20,630
my meals, the way I eat, the
way my relationship, my sleep,

2659
02:48:20,690 --> 02:48:23,240
those are very, very
valuable assets, you know.

2660
02:48:23,270 --> 02:48:26,270
Plus the time I have to
do things I love to do.

2661
02:48:27,350 --> 02:48:31,020
That's kind of when this is fuel.
Like when I feel like I'm every,

2662
02:48:31,430 --> 02:48:36,430
so I feel like I'm happy enough to be my
best at service because I always tried

2663
02:48:36,981 --> 02:48:41,530
to be at service, helping somebody with
Jujitsu, with knowledge, with nutrition,

2664
02:48:41,570 --> 02:48:46,370
with breathing. You know, it's not about
the price is about the service, you know?

2665
02:48:46,371 --> 02:48:50,000
And then I put my head in the and
said, yeah, I have a nice day.

2666
02:48:50,001 --> 02:48:52,700
I make a good speech. We've, Joe Hogan,

2667
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:56,030
I'd have a girl I spoke
with at Bravo was great day.

2668
02:48:56,540 --> 02:49:00,260
So somehow in a purpose
for the federation.

2669
02:49:00,650 --> 02:49:04,820
So I always try to be positive,
but I have no schedule fix.

2670
02:49:04,821 --> 02:49:06,040
Like I have to wake up vote.

2671
02:49:06,041 --> 02:49:11,041
You wouldn't know because at this point
I create a lifestyle which make me a few

2672
02:49:12,721 --> 02:49:17,721
good to engage in different elements like
this federation now and having glasses

2673
02:49:19,051 --> 02:49:23,070
on crowns and be here to be
full of energy. You know,

2674
02:49:23,071 --> 02:49:26,130
because sometimes you don't notice,

2675
02:49:26,131 --> 02:49:30,610
but based on your, your,
uh, your commitments,

2676
02:49:30,611 --> 02:49:35,160
your obligation, you'll becoming
more like a Robert and you, you,

2677
02:49:35,170 --> 02:49:38,910
you lose the perspective of what
you need to be at your best.

2678
02:49:39,570 --> 02:49:43,200
And if you lose that perspective,
even though you still doing your routine,

2679
02:49:43,740 --> 02:49:46,890
sometimes you just minus you just 80,
70,

2680
02:49:46,891 --> 02:49:51,180
60% of what you should be. So you're
not going to be the best husband,

2681
02:49:51,181 --> 02:49:54,540
you're not going to be the best father,
the best employer, the best employee,

2682
02:49:54,840 --> 02:49:56,340
you just, you know, it's just,

2683
02:49:57,000 --> 02:50:01,290
so at this point I feel like I have
to be at my best physically do my,

2684
02:50:01,320 --> 02:50:06,270
if I feel like I have to stretch, they're
going to stretch, breed, joke, have fun,

2685
02:50:06,271 --> 02:50:10,500
listen buddy, whatever, you know.
And then when I feel like, man,

2686
02:50:10,501 --> 02:50:15,180
I'm so happy I could not eat so, and then
I can go and do my service, you know?

2687
02:50:15,180 --> 02:50:16,470
And you know,

2688
02:50:16,471 --> 02:50:20,270
because the window of life is
smaller now for me is becomes,

2689
02:50:20,490 --> 02:50:21,570
I don't have too much time.

2690
02:50:22,050 --> 02:50:26,070
So I don't waste time to do what people
expect from me. I tried to do things.

2691
02:50:26,330 --> 02:50:28,080
I read the relevant to my soul,

2692
02:50:28,830 --> 02:50:31,340
like this federation now I,

2693
02:50:31,740 --> 02:50:34,320
I when I dream I don't dream small.

2694
02:50:34,321 --> 02:50:38,150
I dream like I make like
a very space for a huge,

2695
02:50:38,300 --> 02:50:42,930
the biggest dream I can dream. And
I see that, you know, that level of,

2696
02:50:44,160 --> 02:50:47,420
of need for the community
and the level of,

2697
02:50:47,830 --> 02:50:52,830
of position I have to be the reference
for that shift in the direction of our

2698
02:50:54,721 --> 02:50:56,490
culture,
in our knowledge.

2699
02:50:57,120 --> 02:51:01,860
I feel like I could not be more motivated,
more happy to engage on this.

2700
02:51:02,460 --> 02:51:05,930
So, and that's always life is about
is just do your best and, and,

2701
02:51:05,931 --> 02:51:10,140
and be excited to be motivated
to, to, to the next day.

2702
02:51:10,360 --> 02:51:13,130
There's such a refreshing
attitude. Your attitude, your,

2703
02:51:13,160 --> 02:51:16,750
your philosophy on life because I
think it's very easy and I've been,

2704
02:51:16,960 --> 02:51:20,440
I've trapped myself in it sometimes
where you concentrate too much.

2705
02:51:20,441 --> 02:51:21,191
I'm making money,

2706
02:51:21,191 --> 02:51:25,530
concentrate too much on being ambitious
and you forget the quality of life.

2707
02:51:25,710 --> 02:51:28,750
And you are focuses almost
entirely on your quality of life.

2708
02:51:28,910 --> 02:51:33,860
Yes. You know, because like I said,
and then how much cost your motivation,

2709
02:51:33,950 --> 02:51:38,170
how much cost your friends, how much
cost your health, how much costs,

2710
02:51:38,171 --> 02:51:42,110
your intelligence, those
things is priceless. I, man,

2711
02:51:42,140 --> 02:51:45,230
if you take those off your life,
you take on more vision of your life,

2712
02:51:45,790 --> 02:51:48,830
can be Bill Gates can be the biggest.
So if you,

2713
02:51:48,950 --> 02:51:52,220
if you ask me if I want to have bill gates
life, I don't know. I don't know him.

2714
02:51:52,970 --> 02:51:56,600
So it's not a base on his bank
account is based on how happy he is,

2715
02:51:56,601 --> 02:51:59,510
how horny he is, how, you know, how, how,

2716
02:52:00,260 --> 02:52:04,100
how motivated he is to wake up and do
his thing. He don't look too horny.

2717
02:52:08,280 --> 02:52:11,710
So, so that's, that's
a very essential thing,

2718
02:52:11,740 --> 02:52:14,800
which sometimes sleep
to people's fingers and,

2719
02:52:15,190 --> 02:52:18,910
and the priorities in the daily,
you know, in the payments.

2720
02:52:18,911 --> 02:52:22,660
And so I put you in a role
where, uh, I feel like,

2721
02:52:23,440 --> 02:52:24,490
um,

2722
02:52:25,170 --> 02:52:28,840
if you tell me in the
past what's the core age,

2723
02:52:28,841 --> 02:52:30,310
what's the opposite of courage?

2724
02:52:30,311 --> 02:52:34,990
I want to see cowardness because either
you tough enough to challenge and to

2725
02:52:34,991 --> 02:52:38,410
fight or to Orin,
Daniel cow and then you chicken out.

2726
02:52:38,411 --> 02:52:43,270
So that's in the past was like the,
the, the, the, the opposite of, of,

2727
02:52:43,360 --> 02:52:44,410
of courage.

2728
02:52:45,310 --> 02:52:49,900
It's very hard to measure this in those
days and I believe the opposite of

2729
02:52:49,901 --> 02:52:53,620
cordage should they use conformity,
you know, is people get conformed,

2730
02:52:53,980 --> 02:52:56,800
oh I don't like my wife
the way I used to like,

2731
02:52:57,220 --> 02:53:01,150
but I'm never going to divorce because
I'm afraid to lose my house or the

2732
02:53:01,151 --> 02:53:04,750
situation is so established so I want
to keep, so I don't like this job,

2733
02:53:04,751 --> 02:53:08,960
but I want to keep here because better
than his. So in, in, in other hands,

2734
02:53:08,970 --> 02:53:11,640
the future, if you get quite
on that kind of compromise to,

2735
02:53:11,710 --> 02:53:14,890
to maintain because you
were afraid to risk,

2736
02:53:15,430 --> 02:53:19,450
that's keep you like one step
behind from you, follow your heart,

2737
02:53:19,451 --> 02:53:23,350
follow an ambition. You should 18 years
old, you don't think twice. Like I said,

2738
02:53:23,351 --> 02:53:25,570
hey, let's go to Australia.
You think, okay, let's go boom.

2739
02:53:25,930 --> 02:53:28,500
But when you fifth to sales training
and what are they going to do there?

2740
02:53:28,520 --> 02:53:30,700
Maybe I'm going to, so
it's different, you know,

2741
02:53:32,440 --> 02:53:34,870
and that's kind of hate
or what's going on. Yeah.

2742
02:53:34,871 --> 02:53:39,871
So that's kind of pretty much where keep
you from be at your best because if you

2743
02:53:42,250 --> 02:53:44,260
willing to sacrifice,

2744
02:53:44,440 --> 02:53:48,000
if you will into two
broke new new challenges.

2745
02:53:48,010 --> 02:53:52,750
If you really chew you in stage
of liveliness and excitement and

2746
02:53:52,751 --> 02:53:56,350
unpredictability,
who make you feel like you in heaven?

2747
02:53:57,220 --> 02:54:02,190
You know, every time I was engaging in
a compromise on a fight was something I,

2748
02:54:02,320 --> 02:54:05,500
I think like I have my
routines prior to fight.

2749
02:54:06,250 --> 02:54:10,630
One of them is at the day off my fight,
I wake up and I thank you.

2750
02:54:10,631 --> 02:54:15,631
Glad to be alive and I acknowledge
how perfect we'll be that day.

2751
02:54:15,821 --> 02:54:20,650
If I die today, say fuck my wasn't, it'd
be a perfect day if I die because I have,

2752
02:54:20,680 --> 02:54:24,370
you know, I accomplished my think. I'm
in my mission, I representing my family.

2753
02:54:24,371 --> 02:54:28,870
So I don't go that your tap, I go, that
should die. Like I have to kill me.

2754
02:54:28,871 --> 02:54:32,020
It's not, I'm, I never won at that. So,

2755
02:54:32,021 --> 02:54:36,910
but that's not a spotlight orientation.
This is a philosophical, uh,

2756
02:54:37,210 --> 02:54:41,530
owner representation, you
know, is not something I
teach. My snow should not that,

2757
02:54:41,550 --> 02:54:45,280
no, it's not like that is about
how I feel, how I feed my kids,

2758
02:54:45,281 --> 02:54:48,430
how I follow my tradition.
So in engagement,

2759
02:54:48,460 --> 02:54:52,540
I am not going to be the one who
going to quit. Then I have to kill me.

2760
02:54:52,720 --> 02:54:57,040
My brother, he can throw the
Tao. But for me is unacceptable.

2761
02:54:57,460 --> 02:54:59,830
You know,
I do give up from my life.

2762
02:55:01,060 --> 02:55:05,630
So based on that kind of spiritual
guidance, my life is very intense.

2763
02:55:05,631 --> 02:55:10,190
My life is very, I mean, directed shoe
accomplish give up is not an option.

2764
02:55:10,910 --> 02:55:15,140
You know, I can do, I can
direct my, my, my focus,

2765
02:55:15,260 --> 02:55:17,690
I can give up from something
to go somewhere else,

2766
02:55:18,170 --> 02:55:22,340
but I never will give up from something
because I feel like I cannot reach there.

2767
02:55:22,940 --> 02:55:27,230
I may say, okay, that's not for me. I
go somewhere else. But if I still focus,

2768
02:55:28,010 --> 02:55:30,320
I will take those falls.

2769
02:55:30,321 --> 02:55:34,940
I will take those obstacles
as a motivation to just set
up a new strategy to try

2770
02:55:34,941 --> 02:55:37,970
again. You know, I'm very
competitive in a sense.

2771
02:55:38,570 --> 02:55:42,080
I like the perfection of things.
So this is like a,

2772
02:55:42,530 --> 02:55:45,740
a situation where put you in
a situation where you have no,

2773
02:55:46,160 --> 02:55:49,820
either you go forward or you don't,
but don't stay in the middle.

2774
02:55:49,821 --> 02:55:53,010
Don't say just waiting for
people are waiting for more.

2775
02:55:53,390 --> 02:55:56,480
Those are kinds of things going
to stack you back in life and,

2776
02:55:56,750 --> 02:56:01,520
and just make you feel like passing
through life as you know, you have,

2777
02:56:01,550 --> 02:56:04,550
you know, you irrelevant,
you know, is, is very weak.

2778
02:56:04,970 --> 02:56:06,350
It has a beautiful way to end this.

2779
02:56:07,060 --> 02:56:09,160
Thank you very much brother.
I really appreciate it.

2780
02:56:09,750 --> 02:56:12,580
