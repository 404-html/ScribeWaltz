1
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,720
Are you should fear,
speed rapping and five,

2
00:00:06,721 --> 00:00:07,980
four,
three,

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,780
two,
one go.

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:11,520
One of them said we got to sit in with 
them or whether they've got money.

5
00:00:11,521 --> 00:00:16,521
What I kind of like that we were talking
about how impressive Mac lethal is,

6
00:00:19,651 --> 00:00:20,730
but then argos.
Yeah,

7
00:00:20,731 --> 00:00:23,190
but you got to read the words otherwise 
you have no idea.

8
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:26,620
Yeah.
That would be making anything up pain.

9
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,830
So in that sense I've gone too far.
He's like triple f tits.

10
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:35,580
You can't sing along with that,
the triple afterwards we're like,

11
00:00:35,581 --> 00:00:37,630
I like my boobs.
Like I'll do like this much pressure.

12
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,173
Alright.
Who crushed beer cans with their fake 

13
00:00:40,951 --> 00:00:42,850
boobs and she knows,
yeah,

14
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,440
she knows the lie up your cancer.
Just smash them with the weight of their

15
00:00:46,441 --> 00:00:49,620
ticket.
It's like the most unsexy thing ever.

16
00:00:49,621 --> 00:00:50,454
It's like this hypersexuality gets 
morphed into this weird distortion 

17
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:57,110
that's sexual version of when your dog 
catcher smoking is like,

18
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:01,620
that's what the whole pack of cigarettes
so much watch his gal.

19
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:04,980
She's got to Ted and she's smashing your
kids.

20
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:08,550
Do you imagine?
Course there are foster's fucking Bogan.

21
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:12,960
Australia is trail it shit.
That's hilarious.

22
00:01:12,961 --> 00:01:15,060
Just straight from Tazzie look at those 
fucking,

23
00:01:15,061 --> 00:01:16,050
hey,
we get Steve Harvey,

24
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:20,460
Steve Harvey show.
They just went with fosters steric cause

25
00:01:20,461 --> 00:01:21,294
she's got to be Australia.
That's why they want to foster is that 

26
00:01:22,861 --> 00:01:26,150
kind of behavior.
Maybe they just wanted a big cam because

27
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:29,770
smash big cans fosters,
there's a giant cans.

28
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:33,470
Maybe Budweiser didn't want any part of 
it so they couldn't get a bud tall boy.

29
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:34,523
By the way.
You know nobody Australia drinks 

30
00:01:35,251 --> 00:01:35,911
fosters,
no,

31
00:01:35,911 --> 00:01:36,744
they don't write.
You don't even have available and most 

32
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:39,280
bars really?
Yeah.

33
00:01:39,281 --> 00:01:40,114
It's not even like bud light where 
nobody really drinks it but like sneaky 

34
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:44,460
or just marketing.
Everything is marketing.

35
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,180
What is a beer like?
Our beer is pabst blue ribbon is kind of

36
00:01:48,181 --> 00:01:50,910
fun because it's so white trash.

37
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:51,923
Pull out a can of paps.
Like I'll drink a can of paps at the 

38
00:01:53,401 --> 00:01:54,410
store sometimes.
I'm like,

39
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,360
do you mean like at the supermarket?
No College.

40
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,310
I was like,
what?

41
00:02:00,311 --> 00:02:05,311
Like why are flops on harbage white with
flip flops on boxer shorts.

42
00:02:08,731 --> 00:02:09,564
Fuck it.
Wife beater triggered up gigantic pabst 

43
00:02:12,961 --> 00:02:14,820
blue ribbon.
Normal Australian life photo.

44
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:15,733
That's a quarter of the men.
Would do that kind of shit like while 

45
00:02:17,491 --> 00:02:20,350
I'm shopping for other snacks.
I love it over there.

46
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,370
They're great people there.
If you were going to ask their beer like

47
00:02:23,371 --> 00:02:24,690
that is vb.
VB,

48
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:25,863
yeah.
That's said there was another country 

49
00:02:26,941 --> 00:02:29,880
that I would live in besides America or 
besides the United States.

50
00:02:29,881 --> 00:02:30,714
It would be Canada and if there's 
another country I'd live in besides 

51
00:02:32,401 --> 00:02:34,350
Canada,
it would be Australia for sure,

52
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,870
and Canada because it's right there.
It's too cold.

53
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:39,720
Not Vancouver.
Vancouver's too cold as well.

54
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,010
He could handle it.
Fine.

55
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,050
I can handle it.
You're a traveling man.

56
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,340
I skipped the fucking winter,
so I go traveling.

57
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:46,921
Oh,
you're out.

58
00:02:46,921 --> 00:02:47,970
You're saying your travel.
Yeah,

59
00:02:47,971 --> 00:02:48,451
yeah,
yeah,

60
00:02:48,451 --> 00:02:49,051
yeah.
You're right.

61
00:02:49,051 --> 00:02:50,580
If you just got there in the rainy 
season,

62
00:02:50,581 --> 00:02:54,990
which is like nine months,
three months are amazing.

63
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,540
I was doing the math on New York does to
the other day of like second.

64
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,480
How many actual months of Nice it is and
it's really a six and six.

65
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:03,070
Yeah.
Not even nine and three.

66
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,540
No,
it's not six and six.

67
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,433
Yeah.
Fuck.

68
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:05,921
Yeah,
it's,

69
00:03:05,921 --> 00:03:06,754
there's,
there's some rugged days in those nice 

70
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,610
months to,
you know,

71
00:03:10,611 --> 00:03:13,540
all those,
like those six if you go like,

72
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:16,060
it's really probably nine,
but there's three months.

73
00:03:16,061 --> 00:03:17,920
They're super sketchy.
Super Sketchy.

74
00:03:17,921 --> 00:03:20,530
It snow in April.
We've got April this year.

75
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,250
Yeah.
Yeah.

76
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,590
That's annoying.
I was in Australia and I were there were

77
00:03:23,591 --> 00:03:24,850
like,
it's snowing in New York and like that's

78
00:03:24,851 --> 00:03:25,960
like a prince song by the way.

79
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,360
Stolen April.
Sometimes it snows in April.

80
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:30,130
Is that about cocaine?
Kind of is more sensitive ones?

81
00:03:30,131 --> 00:03:30,920
No.
Oh,

82
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,500
it's about sadness.
Oh,

83
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,930
I used to listen to it when I was 
delivering newspapers.

84
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:38,650
I think it was great.
Mark Norman had a theory that was proven

85
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:39,970
wrong.
I guess that a prince,

86
00:03:39,971 --> 00:03:40,804
when he died,
he died of the last of the eighties 

87
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:46,090
aids.
He said he's been fighting it hard cause

88
00:03:46,091 --> 00:03:50,950
of the money,
but he got it back actually fucked up.

89
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,660
He died from fentanyl man.
They all died from that fentanyl shit.

90
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:55,563
That stuff kills everybody.
They're testing drugs now at music 

91
00:03:57,971 --> 00:03:58,804
festivals.
They should that and they did it in 

92
00:04:01,091 --> 00:04:01,924
Australia when I was there.
They do it in UK in some places where 

93
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:05,494
you just come and they chip off the 
smallest amount and they text you get 

94
00:04:09,731 --> 00:04:13,450
your stuff is safe or not and then it's 
way safer to do it.

95
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:16,510
Then just fucking passing around fat.
They need deregulation.

96
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,520
They just do.
They just need deregulation.

97
00:04:18,521 --> 00:04:20,800
You're not saving anybody by making 
drugs illegal.

98
00:04:20,801 --> 00:04:23,560
You're just making it difficult to get 
good drugs.

99
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,453
That's all you're doing.
You're not stopping people from doing 

100
00:04:25,931 --> 00:04:27,760
drugs and in fact when they legalize 
things,

101
00:04:27,761 --> 00:04:32,380
often teen use goes down because it's,
it doesn't become so attractive anymore,

102
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:34,060
but people are stupid.
All right,

103
00:04:34,061 --> 00:04:36,850
we are wired fucked up and you can tell 
us we can't do something.

104
00:04:36,851 --> 00:04:39,010
That's the thing we want to do.
That's just how it is.

105
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,360
I will say,
to be fair,

106
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:44,500
I will say legalization of drugs would 
make more people do it.

107
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:47,860
I would have to think it would.
Psychologically they say no when they've

108
00:04:47,861 --> 00:04:49,200
done studies.
Nobody though.

109
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,250
There's some people that wouldn't 
normally do and be like,

110
00:04:51,251 --> 00:04:52,300
well,
there's a store right there.

111
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:52,870
All right.
Okay.

112
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,250
Sorry.
I don't know about that man.

113
00:04:54,251 --> 00:04:55,084
I think it normalizes after awhile.
I think it starts off like that in the 

114
00:04:57,821 --> 00:04:59,830
beginning,
but I think what that is is the residual

115
00:04:59,831 --> 00:05:03,610
effect of making it pro prohibited,
the residual effect.

116
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,520
But then once it becomes legal,
like alcohol,

117
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,890
if you're 21 you don't walk by cvs and 
go,

118
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:11,260
I could just go buy it.
Why don't I just go get some whiskey?

119
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,040
Do you know?
I mean,

120
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,610
but people way more people drink than 
two drugs.

121
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:18,940
Right,
but they don't do it because it's like a

122
00:05:18,941 --> 00:05:22,210
new thing.
It's so easy to get it.

123
00:05:22,211 --> 00:05:23,290
It's just there.
I'm sad.

124
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,153
You got to think.
Some people that would never would have 

125
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:26,224
done it.
I have conservative friends from high 

126
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:29,670
school that never would do it,
but if it was on the same levels,

127
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,510
alcohol in 20 years,
they'll be like,

128
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:32,221
oh,
okay.

129
00:05:32,221 --> 00:05:33,190
I was my,
all my friends are doing it.

130
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:36,520
I don't know if it's worse.
I really just not worst.

131
00:05:36,521 --> 00:05:37,354
I won't say it's worse.
I'm just saying there's some people who 

132
00:05:38,231 --> 00:05:40,870
would,
but I think overall you end up getting a

133
00:05:40,871 --> 00:05:43,530
lot less people like total numbers to do
it well.

134
00:05:43,531 --> 00:05:46,030
I think things would normalize.
I really do.

135
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:47,860
I think we have a real,
there's a,

136
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:51,550
it's a responsibility that I think 
society has to,

137
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:54,670
this fucked up prohibition that we've 
know is ridiculous.

138
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:58,190
We have too much information now.
We know too much about people

139
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,023
to make things prohibited when you make 
other things that are just as dangerous 

140
00:06:01,131 --> 00:06:01,761
legal.
Right,

141
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:02,930
so it's all fucking farce.
Yeah.

142
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:03,773
It doesn't make any sense.
When alcohol is legal and marijuana 

143
00:06:05,511 --> 00:06:06,810
isn't,
or alcohol's legal,

144
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,140
mushrooms aren't,
you're talking nonsense.

145
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:13,490
People drink themselves to death every 
day to death every day,

146
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,680
not just liver effects.
Alcohol poisoning.

147
00:06:15,681 --> 00:06:18,800
Thousands of people every year die from 
alcohol poisoning.

148
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,740
Did.
You can't do mushrooms that much.

149
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,630
You can't die from it.
You can't,

150
00:06:23,631 --> 00:06:25,270
but it will just stop working on it.
You won't do it.

151
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:27,260
Exactly.
Keep doubling the dosage.

152
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:28,423
By the end of the week,
you'll be doing like a pound of 

153
00:06:30,381 --> 00:06:32,870
mushrooms and that's fine.
Yeah,

154
00:06:32,871 --> 00:06:34,040
exactly.
I'm going to do that.

155
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:35,750
Your shit's will be crazy.
Well,

156
00:06:35,751 --> 00:06:38,030
Dennis Mckenna,
who I had on last week,

157
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:38,864
his brother terrance had that theory 
about human evolution and it's a very 

158
00:06:42,141 --> 00:06:45,050
compelling theory and there's firms make
human ability.

159
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:45,933
They might have caused it,
but it might've been one of several 

160
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:49,910
factors.
There was several factors.

161
00:06:49,911 --> 00:06:50,744
One of them was climate change,
like the monkeys had to move down from 

162
00:06:52,641 --> 00:06:53,474
the trees because there was no food left
and the grasslands had taken over where 

163
00:06:56,301 --> 00:06:59,300
the rain forest had been cause just 
because of climate change.

164
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,150
But that was the same period where all 
these undulates lift.

165
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,760
So all of these cow like creatures,
shit all over the place.

166
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,210
The mushrooms growing out,
these monkeys that were experimental,

167
00:07:08,211 --> 00:07:09,044
the human monkey started eating these 
things and then started developing 

168
00:07:11,811 --> 00:07:14,540
language skills,
more sophisticated hunting,

169
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:17,240
better visual because the visual 
perception,

170
00:07:17,241 --> 00:07:20,720
especially in low doses,
it actually increases acuity been proven

171
00:07:20,721 --> 00:07:23,810
in scientific double blind placebo 
controlled studies.

172
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:24,650
Yeah.
Yeah.

173
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:28,490
It increases visual cues,
increases your ability to recognize when

174
00:07:28,491 --> 00:07:29,324
things are shifting.
Like say if you have two lines and one 

175
00:07:30,711 --> 00:07:31,544
of them slightly shifts,
like maybe a half of 1% angle that 

176
00:07:33,831 --> 00:07:35,600
people that were on mushrooms could see 
it.

177
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,150
You ever see a clock or be able to see 
them in a hand move,

178
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,013
like get zoned in where you can like 
slow sort of see it move in a couple of 

179
00:07:41,631 --> 00:07:43,100
times,
but only because when I was little,

180
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:44,210
whoa.
But yeah,

181
00:07:44,211 --> 00:07:45,980
that's what that kind of,
yeah,

182
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:49,550
we can like my vision sucks now dude.
When I look at a clock,

183
00:07:49,551 --> 00:07:53,060
I look at like vague numbers like that,
that clock right now.

184
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,800
Like I look at that,
that little one right there.

185
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,020
Yeah,
I look at,

186
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,220
those are vague numbers.
You can't see those.

187
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,940
I can see him.
I know that's 12 months to close.

188
00:08:00,941 --> 00:08:02,840
That's Peter went out,
look at this.

189
00:08:02,841 --> 00:08:04,640
Bam.
Now I could see all the dots.

190
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,290
I could see everything.
Get the surgery.

191
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,340
No,
it's not that.

192
00:08:07,341 --> 00:08:09,080
It's,
it's close.

193
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:12,050
It's near sightedness.
It's what happens when you get older.

194
00:08:12,051 --> 00:08:13,400
It's just macular degeneration.

195
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:14,980
This is too near for you.
No,

196
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:18,110
no.
Things that are near don't look as good.

197
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,780
That's,
that's like a good medium distance,

198
00:08:20,781 --> 00:08:22,670
but farther things look exactly the 
same.

199
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,270
It's a slow degeneration of your 
eyesight due to age.

200
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,700
My friend was not remembering my friend 
Steve Graham,

201
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,890
he's an ophthalmologist.
He's like,

202
00:08:30,891 --> 00:08:32,240
there's not a goddamn thing you can do 
about it.

203
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,210
Doctor Steve with the,
yeah,

204
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,200
yeah.
From the US ski team.

205
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:37,483
He told me some great advice I will 
share with everyone we were talking 

206
00:08:39,861 --> 00:08:42,200
about on my podcast.
We were talking with him about um,

207
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:46,370
the hours they put in and I was like,
if you're putting a 10 hours,

208
00:08:46,371 --> 00:08:48,700
you can't be as good at four 30 as you 
are because,

209
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,250
oh,
there's your,

210
00:08:50,251 --> 00:08:52,430
should never make a doctor appointment 
in the afternoon.

211
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,080
Ooh,
they're tired.

212
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:56,160
They're not giving you their work.
Wow.

213
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,173
Yeah.
He's like always make a morning 

214
00:08:57,931 --> 00:09:00,180
appointment when they actually had just 
had their coffee.

215
00:09:00,181 --> 00:09:00,720
Like,
all right,

216
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,510
let's start dude.
I had this guy,

217
00:09:03,511 --> 00:09:05,970
Dr.
Matthew Walker on a couple of weeks ago.

218
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,970
It was a sleep specialist and was 
talking about how important sleep is.

219
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,253
And one thing in common with a lot of 
people that suffer from Alzheimer's is 

220
00:09:12,811 --> 00:09:14,640
they were getting like three,
four hours sleep at night.

221
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:16,770
They were those get up and go type 
people.

222
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,373
Their brains wind up short.
Now he's saying that really sleep is 

223
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:24,030
unbelievably important.
It's one of those podcasts,

224
00:09:24,031 --> 00:09:26,550
you listen to it and it literally will 
change your behavior patterns.

225
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:31,110
I don't know if we're changing,
my behavior does slip so fucking much.

226
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:34,990
I just stay in bed for like five hours 
after I wake up and what's,

227
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:39,960
what's the point you live in the life?
Ours fear and a lot of ways if it's cold

228
00:09:39,961 --> 00:09:41,040
out,
I've told everybody,

229
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:43,230
man at a,
all my friends that you know,

230
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,870
quote unquote made it,
it became successful.

231
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,580
You went the full whole hog.
You like the one who never got caught in

232
00:09:50,581 --> 00:09:52,770
any of the trappings.
You got snipped.

233
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:54,060
You've said,
fuck it,

234
00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:55,240
I want to live in New York.
It,

235
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,213
fuck it.
I want to disappear in Asia for three 

236
00:09:57,241 --> 00:09:58,074
months.
They tell you to do something with your 

237
00:09:59,151 --> 00:10:00,600
TV show and you're like,
fuck you.

238
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,880
It's over.
And I mean,

239
00:10:02,881 --> 00:10:05,430
you're really doing what everybody wants
to do.

240
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:09,240
I have one fuck you moment ever.
Like that really is when uh,

241
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:11,220
I had a book deal and I gave them the 
money back.

242
00:10:11,221 --> 00:10:13,440
I didn't know like they were trying to 
fuck with it too much.

243
00:10:13,441 --> 00:10:14,370
I was like,
this is annoying.

244
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,513
Take your money back.
Felt great to be the only real control 

245
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:22,230
once you feel,
I feel more free that anyone ever,

246
00:10:22,231 --> 00:10:24,330
I look around on this matrix level of 
like,

247
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,510
why don't you guys have more freedom for
yourselves?

248
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,553
Yeah,
you've got the most freedom out of all 

249
00:10:29,071 --> 00:10:32,150
my friends were talking about with 
Burton,

250
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,300
they see it.
They were like,

251
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:35,670
we were talking about what B and b of 
each other's lives,

252
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,690
you know,
their family life,

253
00:10:36,691 --> 00:10:37,980
where's my whatever life.
And they were like,

254
00:10:37,981 --> 00:10:39,990
Bart was like,
what do you think I envy about?

255
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,113
I'm like,
Huh?

256
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:42,690
I was like,
it's my freedom.

257
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,610
And he was like,
I have just much freedom was due.

258
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:47,370
And I was like,
I just,

259
00:10:47,371 --> 00:10:48,690
I laugh.
I was like,

260
00:10:48,691 --> 00:10:50,730
what are you talking about?
Fuck,

261
00:10:50,731 --> 00:10:52,440
are you talking about it?
But it doesn't make any sense.

262
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,670
He was like,
what do you mean brandy's?

263
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,090
He had to explain it to them.
He goes already could just from here.

264
00:10:57,091 --> 00:10:59,290
Just go away.
Not Call anybody.

265
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,270
Yeah,
just go from here.

266
00:11:00,271 --> 00:11:01,031
Whatever.
He's got it.

267
00:11:01,031 --> 00:11:02,050
Just go away.
Yeah.

268
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:03,300
You can't do that.

269
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,600
If you didn't tell me you were going and
you vanish for a few months,

270
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,160
I would call the police.
You would?

271
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,900
Yeah,
cause I would worry about you.

272
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:12,180
But once you tell me like I'm going to 
go to Asia,

273
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:12,610
my car,
I,

274
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:13,443
dude,
I guess I'll talk to you when you get 

275
00:11:15,631 --> 00:11:16,830
back.
People got so worried.

276
00:11:16,831 --> 00:11:18,030
They're like,
what's happens if you get arrested?

277
00:11:18,031 --> 00:11:19,380
I'm like,
I'm going to do the time,

278
00:11:19,381 --> 00:11:20,250
Bro.
I don't know.

279
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,350
I'll figure out a way to get to the 
embassy maybe,

280
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:24,090
but,
but if you just vanished,

281
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,313
you kind of have a little bit of 
responsibility for people that care 

282
00:11:26,881 --> 00:11:27,714
about you.
You don't want to hurt their feelings 

283
00:11:29,011 --> 00:11:30,310
and just let the word out.
Yeah.

284
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,500
I think don't tell them,
hey,

285
00:11:31,501 --> 00:11:33,300
I'm going.
Then they have to deal with,

286
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,160
they might miss you,
but they just have to deal with it.

287
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:37,470
They don't have to like freak out.
Like what happened to our,

288
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:38,543
yeah.
I told my parents wasn't a disappear on 

289
00:11:39,961 --> 00:11:40,800
though.
That's good.

290
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,000
Yeah.
You got to tell your parents,

291
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:45,660
but certain people fuck it.
Let them figure it out by manager got so

292
00:11:45,661 --> 00:11:46,231
mad.
She was like,

293
00:11:46,231 --> 00:11:48,370
you can't not tell me where you're going
and not be able to reach you.

294
00:11:48,371 --> 00:11:49,470
I'm like,
Oh,

295
00:11:49,471 --> 00:11:51,600
I definitely can.
I'm doing that because that's not,

296
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:52,830
I was like,
if it makes you feel better,

297
00:11:52,831 --> 00:11:54,020
I'm not.
My mom had a rich

298
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,860
man.
That does make me feel better.

299
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,440
There's something to what you did 
though.

300
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,303
I think it's you.
I felt you felt like a little different 

301
00:12:02,651 --> 00:12:03,930
to me when he came back.
Yeah,

302
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:04,541
yeah,
yeah.

303
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,100
Like you had just,
you know,

304
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:09,760
you'd had so many experiences.
I think everything fades away.

305
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,890
Responsibility was,
I'm reading this book,

306
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:14,020
the talent code,
you ever heard of it?

307
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,340
It's a really interesting book where 
they analyze performers and different,

308
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:21,880
different venues,
like different things that they do.

309
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:24,670
Different sports,
different art.

310
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,810
Yeah.
And Jackson's who?

311
00:12:27,811 --> 00:12:28,644
Greg Jackson,
amazing book I think for anybody and it 

312
00:12:32,221 --> 00:12:35,520
makes you really realize first of all 
how many sets you should be doing.

313
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:38,640
He should be doing a ton of long sets.
As many law.

314
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:41,340
The most time on stage you have the 
better.

315
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:42,563
It's very critical like the longer long 
sets because an hour like you're going 

316
00:12:46,311 --> 00:12:48,870
to perform.
If you're headlining the most you can do

317
00:12:48,871 --> 00:12:51,840
those the better because you really 
there.

318
00:12:51,841 --> 00:12:54,810
That's a different thing when you do a 
weekend,

319
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,240
don't you feel like if you do Thursday,
Friday,

320
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,000
Saturday at a comedy club,
Saturday night late show you are fucking

321
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:00,843
colliding

322
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:01,773
fire and if I do like the third straight
week of five show weekends by then it's 

323
00:13:07,381 --> 00:13:08,370
like,
oh you guys are getting it right.

324
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:11,430
Wonderful show right now.
Do you just get smooth?

325
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,293
Yeah.
I the one of the smoothest I ever got 

326
00:13:13,681 --> 00:13:18,210
was I did that a maxim tour with Charlie
Murphy and half Ron and dude,

327
00:13:18,211 --> 00:13:20,550
we did 22 dates in a month or we were 
just,

328
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,720
oh we just go on stage.
You're like in this zen state,

329
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,910
you're just,
you're doing so much stand up.

330
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,370
That's how I come back from Edinburgh.
Yeah.

331
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,770
Yeah.
You just 25 straight days of an hour and

332
00:13:31,771 --> 00:13:32,604
I,
and then you're like,

333
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,013
you're just,
you have to tweak it a little when you 

334
00:13:34,551 --> 00:13:36,960
get home.
But like it's just like you're there,

335
00:13:36,961 --> 00:13:38,820
you're just doing it over and over again
all the way.

336
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,190
I think in the beginning of standup when
you're starting,

337
00:13:41,191 --> 00:13:42,024
I think lots of sets are good cause then
you learn how to win over a crowd a 

338
00:13:44,581 --> 00:13:45,414
bunch of times.
So three new crowds is better than one 

339
00:13:47,581 --> 00:13:49,620
45 minutes to completely agree.
But then yeah,

340
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:51,050
once you're doing it longer,
it's like

341
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,473
look at it like form your hour.
Well this is what I was getting to with 

342
00:13:54,281 --> 00:13:55,580
that talent code book.
Oh yeah.

343
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,513
It is on development of skills.
Just talking about how many amazing 

344
00:13:58,841 --> 00:13:59,674
Brazilian soccer players came out of 
this one area and they were trying to 

345
00:14:01,901 --> 00:14:04,480
figure it out and they realize,
oh it was,

346
00:14:04,481 --> 00:14:06,970
they have this other game that they play
with a smaller,

347
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:07,804
heavier ball and it's harder.
And so they do that game and it's like 

348
00:14:10,661 --> 00:14:12,760
in clothes co they'll do it in like a 
room,

349
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,170
like a small room.
Like this room.

350
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:15,123
They'll play the soccer game and they 
get amazing footwork and movement 

351
00:14:18,341 --> 00:14:20,410
because that,
because they're in such close quarters,

352
00:14:20,411 --> 00:14:21,550
they,
they're very fast.

353
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:25,210
And so they take those skills and apply 
them to soccer,

354
00:14:25,211 --> 00:14:26,680
football,
whatever they call it.

355
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:29,440
And it's fucking amazing how much they 
excel.

356
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:32,380
This is what I'm talking to some of 
those roasts battle guys.

357
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,533
Mm.
There's always rose pedal cars and you 

358
00:14:34,431 --> 00:14:35,330
know,
they're not like,

359
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,480
as,
as,

360
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,360
as developed.
It's on stage as they are for those rose

361
00:14:40,361 --> 00:14:40,821
petals.
Yeah.

362
00:14:40,821 --> 00:14:42,670
But some of them like Joe Dosh,
people like that,

363
00:14:42,671 --> 00:14:44,590
the kill [inaudible] when those roles 
paddles.

364
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,480
So then it's like,
what are you doing?

365
00:14:46,481 --> 00:14:50,270
So it's talking to Eli Sayers,
who's like unified champ and a,

366
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,820
we figured out like,
you just take those,

367
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,833
those rows style jokes and applied them 
to the guy next to you and traffic or 

368
00:14:57,201 --> 00:14:58,580
whatever.
Like you've really just,

369
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,670
just roasting any topic,
you know,

370
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,420
that comes up.
But you just got to leave.

371
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,260
That should eventually yet no.
Dot.

372
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:06,380
I think there's good training.
Cross training.

373
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:07,243
Yeah.
Yeah,

374
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,083
for sure.
I think there's things like that with 

375
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:10,700
everything.
And I think with you,

376
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:12,260
what I was recognized,
I was like,

377
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,153
oh,
he's just sorta like data crunched all 

378
00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:18,790
these cultures over four months.
Like you came back with like you,

379
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:23,120
you had like last patience for stupidity
and,

380
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:27,050
and more like a,
a more expanded,

381
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:27,943
uh,

382
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:29,183
to how to,
it's hard to gauge someone's 

383
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,750
understanding of the world,
but the way you talked about things,

384
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:35,780
I was like had a more expanded view of 
things you like,

385
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:36,800
wow.
You know,

386
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,840
just,
just America,

387
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:39,733
you know,
like your perspective is like you got 

388
00:15:40,911 --> 00:15:42,950
everybody who thinks that this is the 
word you crazy.

389
00:15:42,951 --> 00:15:46,040
This is just America.
We spend so much time in this bubble,

390
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,260
but when you are out there for like four
months,

391
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:50,450
you came back.
It was almost like you were like,

392
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,410
oh,
okay.

393
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,453
And I think as a human is this,
and I think this is one of the things 

394
00:15:54,861 --> 00:15:58,040
that happens bad to comedians when they 
become successful,

395
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,450
which is one of the reasons why they 
drop off.

396
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,433
They get really famous,
really powerful because they don't take 

397
00:16:02,841 --> 00:16:03,674
any new experiences in because they 
don't take any risks because too many 

398
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:08,000
people like them when they go on stage.

399
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:10,790
I know that played in your own crowd.
His crowd is terrible,

400
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:13,190
but also play to your own crowd is your 
fault.

401
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:17,090
Here's why you should know if your stuff
is good and you should be working on it,

402
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,980
you should be listening to your 
recordings.

403
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:19,873
You should listen to them and go,
is this something that I would want to 

404
00:16:22,401 --> 00:16:23,370
pay to see?
Right,

405
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,223
and if it's not,
let me fix it because like I'm in this 

406
00:16:27,151 --> 00:16:27,984
stage right now,
the right and new act stage where Max 

407
00:16:30,351 --> 00:16:31,184
terrible right now.
I still have the old material that I'll 

408
00:16:34,071 --> 00:16:37,580
have to abandon when a October comes 
around the special airs,

409
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:41,570
but until then I'm just developing shit 
and the new stuff.

410
00:16:41,571 --> 00:16:42,404
It's like I've got six new minutes that 
are worth hearing and they'll a lot of 

411
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:50,180
stuff fucking super clunky.
But if you don't do it,

412
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:53,660
if you don't scare yourself and if you 
don't experience new things,

413
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,673
you don't have you,
you have to know whether your stuff's 

414
00:16:57,441 --> 00:16:58,274
any good.

415
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,630
Okay.
And if you,

416
00:16:59,631 --> 00:17:01,790
if you're not looking at it,
not paying attention,

417
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:05,720
it happens to a lot of famous comedians.
Their specials as they get older,

418
00:17:05,721 --> 00:17:07,400
get softer,
softer,

419
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,253
softer,
and,

420
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,093
and there's just,
kinison was always my favorite example 

421
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,400
because he's one of my all time.
If not,

422
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:16,100
he's like prior and Kennison to me are 
like,

423
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:18,140
that's my mount rushmore,
you know,

424
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,330
in Lenny Bruce,
just for creating the whole thing.

425
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,910
But I have an idea I want to talk to you
about like,

426
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,753
I forgot,
but when you watch early kinison he was 

427
00:17:25,191 --> 00:17:28,430
a fucking monster.
The best.

428
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,320
Who's the best?
And it was such a short time,

429
00:17:30,321 --> 00:17:33,740
but with him it wasn't like a sustained 
success to drop.

430
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:34,850
It was like,
oh,

431
00:17:34,851 --> 00:17:36,080
he went crazy.
He went crazy.

432
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:40,160
He's hanging out with Bon Jovi and doing
blow and bang and strippers.

433
00:17:40,161 --> 00:17:40,994
And being that guy,
he's being that rockstar comedian guy 

434
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,473
and he didn't write anymore.
You could tell he was getting by on 

435
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:47,540
songs and dances,
you know?

436
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:50,370
He was just like show business of 
himself.

437
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:52,200
Remember the todd?
Oh yeah.

438
00:17:52,201 --> 00:17:53,430
Yeah.
So he went crazy.

439
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,350
Right.
You know the todd got me into the store.

440
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,131
Really?
Yeah.

441
00:17:56,131 --> 00:17:59,190
He's the reason I got into the store.
He told me how to do it too.

442
00:17:59,191 --> 00:18:00,870
And you told me you're going to do that 
for your friends.

443
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,210
Sit next to Mitzi and when your friends 
on stage,

444
00:18:03,211 --> 00:18:06,060
you laugh hard and Mitzi,
you go along with you.

445
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:08,550
Oh did he did that.
He sat right next to Mitzi.

446
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,281
Mitzi goes,
Mitzi,

447
00:18:10,281 --> 00:18:12,280
this kids fucking hilarious.
She goes,

448
00:18:12,281 --> 00:18:12,981
oh,
okay,

449
00:18:12,981 --> 00:18:15,380
I'll watch.
I'm just sort of believed that and I got

450
00:18:15,381 --> 00:18:16,940
lucky.
I had a great set and then,

451
00:18:16,941 --> 00:18:19,000
but the todd was probably the loudest 
voice in the room.

452
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:21,490
He was in the back laughing his ass off.
Wow.

453
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,493
I do that for anybody that I remember.
You did it from required for whatever 

454
00:18:24,651 --> 00:18:26,090
else.
Anybody if you're,

455
00:18:26,091 --> 00:18:26,924
if you're,
if you're doing a viewer performing for 

456
00:18:29,101 --> 00:18:30,710
Mitzi,
I had to sit next to Mitzi.

457
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:31,733
I,
we used to sit next to her where my 

458
00:18:32,371 --> 00:18:35,330
friends would showcase just so these 
fucking cock blocks wouldn't come in and

459
00:18:35,331 --> 00:18:37,160
try to talk to you.
It's true too.

460
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,093
It's like,
what are you doing in the middle of 

461
00:18:39,501 --> 00:18:42,170
sets?
Somebody performing for their future.

462
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,870
That's a shift change to the queen.
52 minutes.

463
00:18:44,871 --> 00:18:47,420
They're just leave her alone.
So you just have to block,

464
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:50,090
you get three minutes in front of the 
Queen of comedy.

465
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,550
Yeah.
And these fucking cock blockers.

466
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:53,660
So,
so,

467
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,500
so,
oh the todd,

468
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:56,334
okay,
here's what I'm going to say about that 

469
00:18:56,641 --> 00:18:59,310
in terms of just like curious and being 
a character himself.

470
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,650
So he went crazy,
but that was before he went crazy.

471
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:05,070
There was a thing he used to do where he
would go to the bartenders and take like

472
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:05,993
a glasses off and then just like as 
staring them down and just chuck it in 

473
00:19:08,831 --> 00:19:10,830
the garbage just to like keep up with 
them,

474
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,033
you know?

475
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:13,690
And then when he went crazy,
I mean,

476
00:19:13,691 --> 00:19:14,830
literally crazy.
Yeah.

477
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,233
He's sorta half remember doing that but 
different Bartz who just take them and 

478
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:19,924
kind of like throw them in the garbage 
but not cleaner even know why he was 

479
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:23,494
doing it.
He was just like a pallette out version 

480
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:26,710
was up.
That's how Kennison was.

481
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:28,330
He was like yelling,
right?

482
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:31,120
No Man have rage.
Not just yelling.

483
00:19:31,121 --> 00:19:31,691
Yeah,
it was.

484
00:19:31,691 --> 00:19:34,030
It didn't make any sense anymore.
There was no point.

485
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,063
It was just,
he was just trying to perform and ride 

486
00:19:37,201 --> 00:19:39,900
the wave,
but in the beginning he was angry.

487
00:19:39,901 --> 00:19:41,670
So good.
He was so angry.

488
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,833
They asked him,
how come you don't make fun of men as 

489
00:19:43,951 --> 00:19:45,270
much to make fun of women?
He goes,

490
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,640
because a man has never born and make me
drive my car into a tree.

491
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:50,730
He used to play that song.

492
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:55,830
I want my fucking records back by rap.
God help you.

493
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:57,380
It's fine.
Under a gas truck.

494
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,360
Yeah.
Fuck it was good.

495
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:03,590
Well,
you believed it.

496
00:20:03,591 --> 00:20:04,850
He was just short,
fat,

497
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:09,350
ugly guy who was just screaming at the 
world for all of his pain.

498
00:20:09,351 --> 00:20:12,110
You knew he was in pain and then when he
wasn't in pain anymore,

499
00:20:12,111 --> 00:20:14,660
it wasn't fun.
Then he wasn't in pain anymore.

500
00:20:14,661 --> 00:20:15,494
That he was like,
he was just this superstar and then it 

501
00:20:17,661 --> 00:20:19,880
just didn't work as a superstar.
It's weird.

502
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:20,743
Yeah.
So you're saying a lot of these guys 

503
00:20:21,681 --> 00:20:25,520
don't enter into new experiences.
You have to have new challenges,

504
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:27,290
new experiences.
You have to be excited,

505
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,553
be excited about some new thoughts.
And I think that much like these 

506
00:20:32,721 --> 00:20:36,590
Brazilian soccer players from what does 
named Daniel coyle is who we are.

507
00:20:36,591 --> 00:20:38,990
What's the author's name?
Daniel coyle.

508
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,093
Um,
when he talked about these Brazilian 

509
00:20:41,301 --> 00:20:44,450
soccer players playing this tight room,
the skills they developed in this really

510
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:47,740
tight environment help them in the game.

511
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,580
I think life is like what the training 
ground for standup is.

512
00:20:51,581 --> 00:20:54,490
And if your life is the same boring shit
calling your agent,

513
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,750
you know,
what do we got for me?

514
00:20:55,751 --> 00:20:58,000
You've got a script for me drawing from,
you don't have any,

515
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,013
where's your real world?
You really can't talk about that 

516
00:21:01,061 --> 00:21:01,894
Hollywood shit.
It's boring and people don't relate to 

517
00:21:02,951 --> 00:21:03,784
it.
Some people could.

518
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:05,650
Kathy Griffin,
that's all she talks about.

519
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,020
It's like,
yeah,

520
00:21:07,021 --> 00:21:07,854
I mean,
but it's okay for her and that's her 

521
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:10,420
thing.
She likes to do it.

522
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:11,800
Yeah.
People who like her,

523
00:21:11,801 --> 00:21:12,760
like it,
it's no big deal,

524
00:21:12,761 --> 00:21:15,090
but not for me.
It's not for me and not for you.

525
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,200
I want to relate to someone coming to 
see my show.

526
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,980
But you want to relate to yourself to 
write,

527
00:21:18,981 --> 00:21:20,200
write,
write half things to be like,

528
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:21,100
oh,
let me share this with you.

529
00:21:21,101 --> 00:21:21,700
Yes.

530
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,250
You want to do stand up the you would 
pay for.

531
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,340
Right,
right,

532
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,173
right.
Which is hard to be conscious of the 

533
00:21:25,691 --> 00:21:26,920
audience,
all of that man.

534
00:21:26,921 --> 00:21:27,754
Because you know there's,
you have to figure out why you're doing 

535
00:21:30,761 --> 00:21:31,660
what you're doing.
To like,

536
00:21:31,661 --> 00:21:32,494
am I doing what I'm doing just to get a 
laugh or am I doing what I'm doing 

537
00:21:35,621 --> 00:21:37,350
because I would actually like it.
Yeah.

538
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,910
Just cause I know it's working doesn't 
mean it's good.

539
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,220
Yeah.
And with that,

540
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:42,790
with traveling over it,
whatever,

541
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:43,990
it's like half,
it was like,

542
00:21:43,991 --> 00:21:45,410
let me get some new experiences to draw 
from.

543
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,070
The other half is just let me just 
challenge myself in moments.

544
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,170
Yes,
I can practice overcoming things,

545
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:51,690
you know?
Yeah.

546
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:54,660
It's a crazy businessmen,
crazy business.

547
00:21:54,661 --> 00:21:55,494
And it,
unless you're on top of your own 

548
00:21:56,261 --> 00:21:57,970
thoughts,
you got to be up on yourself.

549
00:21:57,971 --> 00:21:59,710
That's like,
it's like college stuff from high school

550
00:21:59,711 --> 00:22:00,281
where they're like,
look,

551
00:22:00,281 --> 00:22:02,470
they don't care in college,
they're going to let you fail.

552
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,760
They're not going to say,
where's that report?

553
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:04,800
Yeah.
You know,

554
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:05,943
this is even more intense.
This is working for some really high 

555
00:22:09,281 --> 00:22:10,114
pressure corporation.
Don't even understanding at least in 

556
00:22:11,891 --> 00:22:13,720
college you were like,
oh I gotta go do this homework.

557
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:14,260
Be like,
okay,

558
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,220
I get that.
If you're like,

559
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,920
I can't,
I've got to go over my set.

560
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:19,270
Like what do it later?
What do you mean?

561
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:19,861
What?
Why?

562
00:22:19,861 --> 00:22:21,640
And nobody gets went up yesterday.
You don't have to go up again.

563
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:22,503
Well not only that,
who would you talk to to try to explain 

564
00:22:25,151 --> 00:22:28,570
it?
There is maybe a thousand of us on earth

565
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,400
artists know.
Yeah,

566
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:32,250
yeah.
They do a real,

567
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:34,370
if you can start something like that.
My thing is what I,

568
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,313
yeah,
but if you talk about like how many 

569
00:22:36,431 --> 00:22:39,670
headliners are there on earth?
Is there a thousand?

570
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:43,210
We're not talking cruise ships.
No,

571
00:22:43,211 --> 00:22:43,720
no,
no.

572
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,780
I'm talking about someone who can get a 
special right.

573
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:46,783
Someone who comedy central would watch 
or Netflix would walk through Amazon 

574
00:22:49,751 --> 00:22:51,860
category of getting especially uh,
yeah,

575
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:56,500
but probably not a thousand.
So that's not a lot of people.

576
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,373
Yeah.
It's a shit small amount of people for 

577
00:22:59,231 --> 00:23:01,210
an awesome job.
So you've got to figure out,

578
00:23:01,211 --> 00:23:03,730
well why,
why is this a small amount of people?

579
00:23:03,731 --> 00:23:08,500
Because it's a bloody fucking 
catastrophe leading up to success.

580
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:13,660
There's no chance of money early on,
not even a chance and go and go,

581
00:23:13,661 --> 00:23:14,411
I'm going to make it.
It was like,

582
00:23:14,411 --> 00:23:15,244
okay,
if you on a fast track is going to be 

583
00:23:16,451 --> 00:23:18,810
seven years,
if you're on the fat side,

584
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:21,820
if you're on the fast track,
like it ain't around the corner dude.

585
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:22,893
And you're subject to bombing and like 
jump off a bridge bombing at any one of 

586
00:23:26,891 --> 00:23:27,430
those years.

587
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:29,260
Oh yeah.
Jump off a bridge about the cult.

588
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:32,020
I was trying to explain to them what the
cold sweats where and how.

589
00:23:32,021 --> 00:23:33,040
It's like,
hey,

590
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:36,040
almost like out of it,
you feel the sweat but it's,

591
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:39,730
you're shivering at the same time.
Y'All was the worst for me laying in bed

592
00:23:39,731 --> 00:23:41,920
at night after the show.
Oh you're going over it.

593
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:44,560
Everything went wrong.
Wrenching.

594
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:50,050
Oh fuck.
Beyond embarrassing him.

595
00:23:50,051 --> 00:23:50,884
It's beyond embarrassment.
Just ruthless destruction of your self 

596
00:23:55,161 --> 00:23:56,660
esteem.
Just Ah,

597
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:57,780
fuck.
You know,

598
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:00,080
there's a lot of people that just won't 
go back after that.

599
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:02,540
Why would you,
why would you that's uh,

600
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,810
what,
uh,

601
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,980
uh,
theory not what's before theory,

602
00:24:06,981 --> 00:24:10,040
hypothesis.
Cause I haven't proven it all.

603
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:11,003
Why there's fewer women in stand up.
Cause my friend who's a researcher's 

604
00:24:14,301 --> 00:24:17,060
like women's Development,
Rachel Simmons swings books on it.

605
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:20,570
Uh,
she said that women just,

606
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,810
I don't know if it's,
I forget it,

607
00:24:21,811 --> 00:24:22,644
but sociologically or physically,
probably sociologically or less able to 

608
00:24:25,971 --> 00:24:27,890
accept rejection early on.

609
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:29,570
It's just,
that doesn't go with it who they are.

610
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:30,693
Um,
and so they just like don't do those 

611
00:24:32,781 --> 00:24:34,160
things.
And so you have to push them.

612
00:24:34,161 --> 00:24:34,994
If you have daughters you have to push 
them to like try and fail and try and 

613
00:24:36,681 --> 00:24:37,514
fail because failure makes you succeed.
But early on in stand up it's only 

614
00:24:40,941 --> 00:24:42,070
failure.
Yeah,

615
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:46,340
so if your gender's less into that,
let's taking that like outside rejection

616
00:24:46,341 --> 00:24:47,930
or something and you're like,
oh I don't want to do this.

617
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,073
We didn't want to do it.
Sexist is fuck and after denounce you 

618
00:24:51,141 --> 00:24:52,730
now publicly.
That's fair.

619
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,593
I have to go on twitter and tell 
everybody your supporting gender 

620
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:58,123
stereotypes say it definitely met,
have forced women to not be able to 

621
00:25:01,221 --> 00:25:02,054
accept rejection.
Put them in this category where they 

622
00:25:03,441 --> 00:25:04,940
can't accept projection.
Perfect.

623
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:07,970
Which proves that when men and women are
equal,

624
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:10,423
so when they,
now when they've been socialized by a 

625
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:14,054
patriarchy to not accept that they would
then they go into an environment where 

626
00:25:16,701 --> 00:25:18,860
it's only failure and they go,
I don't want to do this.

627
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:19,783
I think if I had to guess,
I think standup is at least 20 to 25% 

628
00:25:23,751 --> 00:25:24,584
harder for women.
This is why I think there's subjects 

629
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,510
that,
especially when you're starting out,

630
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:31,850
men don't want to hear from you in the 
audience.

631
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,133
Men Don't want to hear about politics.
You have a bigger hurdle when it comes 

632
00:25:36,561 --> 00:25:39,590
to points of view,
politics or advice.

633
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:43,280
Anything where a woman is like saying 
like a guy who can get on stage and say,

634
00:25:43,281 --> 00:25:44,114
listen guys,
you want to fucking get your life in 

635
00:25:46,281 --> 00:25:48,200
order.
You got to stop Blah Blah button.

636
00:25:48,201 --> 00:25:49,034
Then the jokes set up and then go on.
But a woman would have a hard time 

637
00:25:51,651 --> 00:25:53,390
giving advice given by,
okay,

638
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,233
I can see that did buy meatheads right.
If let's say this might be true because 

639
00:25:57,051 --> 00:25:58,340
I,
when I say young comics,

640
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:01,670
the stock make a gender actors,
young comics talking about politics,

641
00:26:01,671 --> 00:26:02,390
what's got to change?

642
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:03,223
A part of me goes like 26 year old 
apartment goes shut the fuck up so you 

643
00:26:05,211 --> 00:26:06,590
don't know what the fuck you're talking 
about.

644
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:10,460
So anyone 26 would have to deal with and
I think women have that shit too.

645
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:11,341
Yeah.
They have like,

646
00:26:11,341 --> 00:26:12,174
I want to hear this from you.
And then they have that deep into their 

647
00:26:13,941 --> 00:26:14,774
thirties and forties because men don't 
want to hear it from chicks about 

648
00:26:16,251 --> 00:26:17,270
politics.
Oh,

649
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:19,490
let me go.
She fucking wish Hillary won.

650
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:21,890
Jesus starts a shocker.
You know,

651
00:26:21,891 --> 00:26:24,010
there's like this gender,
uh,

652
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:28,790
like biases that a lot of men have about
a woman getting onstage talking,

653
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,070
controlling all the attention.
They don't like it.

654
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:33,180
And I'll,
a lot of men have the,

655
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,780
I'm not saying it's right or wrong,
it's just I,

656
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:36,650
but I'm just being honest about 
instincts.

657
00:26:36,651 --> 00:26:39,080
There's an instinct to not like it.
Yeah.

658
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:42,230
There's another reason too,
it's that,

659
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:43,680
uh,
Taylor's theory,

660
00:26:43,681 --> 00:26:44,450
which I like,

661
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:46,790
is it women on stage early on?
Oh,

662
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,673
this is why it's harder for men.
It's just the first six months or so 

663
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:49,913
women just the first six months,
women are used to people looking at 

664
00:26:52,591 --> 00:26:53,424
them.
And for men it's this weird new thing 

665
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,420
where it's like,
why you looking at me as strange?

666
00:26:57,421 --> 00:27:00,180
Showing the first like right away and 
open mics like early on,

667
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,080
women are way more comfortable on stage 
of the men.

668
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:05,310
Hmm.
For the most part and then that it evens

669
00:27:05,311 --> 00:27:06,144
out,
but those first few months it's this 

670
00:27:06,841 --> 00:27:07,800
thing of like,
um,

671
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:09,600
this is not a comfortable thing.
Women,

672
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:10,653
it's a negative that I've had to deal 
with that their whole lives but like 

673
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:12,863
people are staring at them all the time.
I think we struggle with this idea of 

674
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:20,220
like,
like saying that I think it's harder for

675
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:22,170
women.
I think it's harder for men because it's

676
00:27:22,171 --> 00:27:25,250
a generalization to,
it's like overall some hard,

677
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,130
it's harder for that.

678
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:27,420
Some men it's where he's report 
whatever.

679
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:28,763
That's when the black and white it,
it's when you fucking ruined all the 

680
00:27:30,541 --> 00:27:33,510
arguments.
I know it's just like 10% harder,

681
00:27:33,511 --> 00:27:34,344
15% owner.
I think one of the reasons it is harder 

682
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:42,500
careerwise for,
I mean almost all women is because uh,

683
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:45,930
success too early can hurt you in the 
long run.

684
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,140
If you start thinking I'm good instead 
of thinking you're terrible,

685
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:52,380
you don't work as hard.
That's just human nature thing.

686
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,573
More for women than for men because 
we're in such a category of needing 

687
00:27:57,241 --> 00:27:58,074
women performers that we go earlier and 
earlier in development in order to plug 

688
00:28:00,811 --> 00:28:01,890
them up.
Huh.

689
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:04,500
Because I,
if I need to put a woman on stage on TV,

690
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,030
you know,
and there's,

691
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:09,020
you know,
this developed women Silverman.

692
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:11,900
It's like I ain't doing that.
I don't want to Saguaros.

693
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:12,570
Yeah,
sure.

694
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:13,530
Okay.
Uh,

695
00:28:13,531 --> 00:28:14,364
so you have to get some women,
you have to have chemisch show somebody 

696
00:28:16,051 --> 00:28:17,880
at home,
your own the version of yourself.

697
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:18,733
Right.
And if there's women viewers got to put 

698
00:28:20,011 --> 00:28:20,960
a woman on,
Huh.

699
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:22,530
You know,
if you have a lot of comics,

700
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,440
but if I'm getting this as a single 
individual performer,

701
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:27,660
if I'm getting something five years in 
and I start going,

702
00:28:27,661 --> 00:28:28,710
yeah,
I'm pretty fucking good.

703
00:28:28,711 --> 00:28:30,150
I don't have to work this hard.
You know,

704
00:28:30,151 --> 00:28:31,560
when I start getting more and more 
things,

705
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:32,483
I work less and less hard.
It's another reason why the fucking 

706
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:36,870
celebrity comics aren't as good as non 
celebrity comics.

707
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:39,690
Um,
but if you start getting stuff,

708
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,553
you start like,
I don't need to work that hard to get 

709
00:28:42,631 --> 00:28:43,464
it.
If you have to study for an hour to get 

710
00:28:44,731 --> 00:28:46,230
an a,
you know what I mean?

711
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,970
Then why would you study for seven 
hours?

712
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,620
Right.
An hour gets you there.

713
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,830
So if you start getting success career 
wise,

714
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:56,700
like monetarily,
you stop working as hard on the artistic

715
00:28:56,701 --> 00:28:57,210
part of it.

716
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:58,560
You can,
you can stop.

717
00:28:58,590 --> 00:28:59,423
Yeah.
Yeah.

718
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:00,121
Um,
yeah,

719
00:29:00,121 --> 00:29:01,830
I think you're 100% right.
Yeah.

720
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:02,693
So this is the drop off.
It sorta does them a disservice as he 

721
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:09,570
has an individual that gets stuff,
but at the same time you want to,

722
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:12,150
so I mean,
as a former booker,

723
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:13,003
as a booker,
all you gotta do is look harder to get 

724
00:29:15,151 --> 00:29:17,250
qualified women go to Indianapolis Five 
Ms Pat,

725
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:18,693
I mean they're out there,
but to prop somebody up who doesn't 

726
00:29:21,721 --> 00:29:23,760
quite deserve it only hurts them in the 
long run.

727
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:24,923
Yeah.
There's the problem also is that you 

728
00:29:28,441 --> 00:29:29,274
want to find a certain number,
like comedy should be almost totally 

729
00:29:32,581 --> 00:29:33,660
egalitarian.
Yeah.

730
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:37,200
It should be just performance based.
Yeah.

731
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:38,243
I mean,
I think if a club has a developmental 

732
00:29:39,391 --> 00:29:42,040
project,
like Wendy does the works in Denver,

733
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:45,160
than it might not be a bad idea to have 
all girl classes.

734
00:29:45,161 --> 00:29:45,994
I bet that would give you a bump for 
anybody who feels uncomfortable and 

735
00:29:49,781 --> 00:29:50,614
wants to learn how to do standup with 
all one of those is harder for for 

736
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:56,830
checks early on is because there's 
crepes and open mikes.

737
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,890
Oh yeah.
They're not weeded out like there aren't

738
00:29:58,891 --> 00:29:59,980
clubs.
The clubs there was like,

739
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:01,110
get out of here.
We don't want you here.

740
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,640
I'd open my any fucking freak that's 
there.

741
00:30:03,641 --> 00:30:04,474
And Man,
that is not a fun experience to deal 

742
00:30:06,131 --> 00:30:06,964
with.
That's why I think that drives around 

743
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,830
with the most right away.
Early on.

744
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,370
Fuck yeah.
Yeah.

745
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,740
Shitty.
Nobody's good.

746
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:15,550
And then also I got this fucking smelly 
guy fucking leering over me.

747
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:16,893
Fuck this.
A hundred percent a hundred percent I 

748
00:30:18,971 --> 00:30:21,670
mean it's nightclub,
creepiness plus crazy people.

749
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:24,160
So you have regular night nightclub,
creepiness,

750
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,670
and then you have open mikes.

751
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,780
Just always a certain percentage of 
people that are insane.

752
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:29,950
It's literally insane.
Insane.

753
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,190
Yeah.
Homeless people.

754
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:33,700
Yeah.
And they get to go up front of you.

755
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:34,703
You're like,
what?

756
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:37,800
What?
I've tried same Mike.

757
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,610
He's the same as you.
Oh,

758
00:30:39,611 --> 00:30:40,750
I forgot about that.
Yeah.

759
00:30:40,751 --> 00:30:41,584
Who knows what kind of Shit you getting 
off that mic on an open mic night and 

760
00:30:44,441 --> 00:30:45,940
the store,
especially back in the day,

761
00:30:45,941 --> 00:30:48,850
they didn't fix nothing with that Mike,
I'll clean.

762
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:49,903
That thing was growing all kinds of shit
on at least it didn't have a foam top 

763
00:30:53,471 --> 00:30:54,304
like this does to hold.
I had to change his phone one cause it 

764
00:30:56,951 --> 00:30:58,950
smelled like my breath.
I was like getting up in the air.

765
00:30:58,951 --> 00:31:02,170
I was like,
smell a person on this.

766
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:03,443
We get a mic that smelled so bad at 
cobb's this weekend that I've mentioned 

767
00:31:06,071 --> 00:31:06,904
it to simone and it was like both like 
it was taking us out of it like 30 

768
00:31:08,951 --> 00:31:10,060
minutes in and usually get used to it.

769
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:10,690
I'm like,
Oh fuck,

770
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:11,523
that's it.
Good.

771
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,393
He said he was made that it was holding 
the mic different regular metal at 

772
00:31:14,261 --> 00:31:16,920
holding it different so we can get it 
away from his nose.

773
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,970
Who was there before you?
I don't know.

774
00:31:18,971 --> 00:31:23,971
I think it was all of us just like,
oh yeah,

775
00:31:25,841 --> 00:31:28,540
these foam things are disgusting.
You know,

776
00:31:28,541 --> 00:31:31,570
some people have those circles.
I have those circles for a while.

777
00:31:31,571 --> 00:31:33,760
They'll spit shields but it seems so 
pretentious.

778
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:36,360
They seem pretentious.
Yeah.

779
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:36,971
Yeah,
yeah.

780
00:31:36,971 --> 00:31:37,804
Those seem where it hop,
pop filter a pop filters that they seem 

781
00:31:40,801 --> 00:31:43,390
super pretentious.
They seem like what are you doing?

782
00:31:43,391 --> 00:31:46,870
Stupid but that fucking Hula Hoop in 
front of your face.

783
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:50,380
So I had a couple ideas on acid.
This music festival,

784
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:56,020
what I want to run by you and that one,
it was fun time by the way.

785
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:59,770
What music festival?
A firefly in Delaware.

786
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:00,813
Nice bus from New York and then you just
go there camp and have a fucking good 

787
00:32:03,311 --> 00:32:05,350
time.
And I'm fucking just like laying down on

788
00:32:05,351 --> 00:32:07,240
my back trying to keep my eyes open so I
can,

789
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:08,980
my friends went off to the bathroom,
like could be here.

790
00:32:08,981 --> 00:32:10,270
I'm like,
I'll be right here.

791
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:11,583
I'm not going anywhere right now.
And so keep my houses that people don't 

792
00:32:13,661 --> 00:32:15,730
look at you like what's wrong with you?
You know,

793
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,820
it's just see a few stars and you'd be 
out of it.

794
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,080
Eyes Open,
but just out of it.

795
00:32:20,081 --> 00:32:21,880
And then every once I fucking love music
festivals,

796
00:32:21,881 --> 00:32:23,440
man,
you come out of it and then some fucking

797
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:26,050
guy dressed like a wood nymph.
You're like,

798
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:28,830
what the fuck?
Anyways,

799
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:29,890
Dad,
I just heard somebody go,

800
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:33,760
I never want to get that fucked up.
Fire me.

801
00:32:33,761 --> 00:32:34,594
I was like,
fuck.

802
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:36,940
So as idea,
you know,

803
00:32:36,941 --> 00:32:39,040
I do those um,
album breakdowns,

804
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,650
my podcast,
first album breakdowns.

805
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:42,703
Uh,
I want to do one with you on Sam 

806
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:46,670
Kennison his album.
Ooh.

807
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:47,660
Just us.
Listen to it.

808
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:50,150
Like talk about it and analyze it and 
stuff.

809
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:51,493
Yeah,
let's do it.

810
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,620
Let's do louder than hell.
Do you know louder than hell?

811
00:32:53,621 --> 00:32:55,370
You can't get on CD.
You can.

812
00:32:55,371 --> 00:32:58,610
Cause it was so homophobic that the 
people at Warner brothers,

813
00:32:58,611 --> 00:32:59,444
they put it out on a cassette,
but then they never released it on cd 

814
00:33:02,841 --> 00:33:05,390
when cds came along and I'm like,
fuck that fat slob.

815
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,160
Wow.
Yeah,

816
00:33:07,161 --> 00:33:08,510
dude,
he's gonna Forget.

817
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,550
Let me tell you how much she had to 
overcome.

818
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:15,580
I was around during the pc days of the 
eighties were in a pc war.

819
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:18,470
Right now.
Seems like it's just a battlefield.

820
00:33:18,471 --> 00:33:19,304
It's just gone crazy.
Like there's more bombs going off pc 

821
00:33:21,111 --> 00:33:21,944
wise and ever.
People are so invested in the idea of 

822
00:33:24,231 --> 00:33:26,120
controlling behavior and telling people 
what to do.

823
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:30,350
But back then it was happening too for a
while with the,

824
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:32,030
with the member,
the music,

825
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,370
Tipper Gore,
Al Gore's wife,

826
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:37,910
his wife was trying to make it a speech 
but there's some things that go too far.

827
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:42,980
Yeah she was trying to ban rap music and
so things got things got real weird.

828
00:33:43,311 --> 00:33:44,144
Same language over and over again.
MTV banned dice clay for life cause he 

829
00:33:47,991 --> 00:33:50,420
told some joke about girls and their 
periods or something.

830
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:56,080
I would love to hear what that joke was 
and see if we can actually like that's a

831
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:59,630
goddamn badge of courage for a guy like 
dice just gave him a gold medal.

832
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,360
That's all it really does for him.
He doesn't give a fuck.

833
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:03,223
That guy legitimately doesn't give a 
fuck cause like I was definitely going 

834
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:06,870
to be good anyway.
He'll,

835
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:07,823
he walks around,
he makes videos walking around the 

836
00:34:09,321 --> 00:34:12,500
supermarket talking about his haircut.
I got this new hair cut.

837
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:14,420
What do you think?
Not make another video.

838
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:17,030
This fucking haircut.
That guy doesn't give a fuck.

839
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:20,690
Like literally it's just doing whatever 
dice wants to do.

840
00:34:20,691 --> 00:34:23,150
Wandering through the world,
hanging out with his kids.

841
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:24,463
So like for him like getting banned from
MTV was probably the greatest thing 

842
00:34:26,961 --> 00:34:28,340
ever.
This is it at it.

843
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:31,490
Wow.
That bravado though.

844
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:35,220
Look it up.
Come on man.

845
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:39,290
Oh my God.
Oh,

846
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,720
zero out of nuts,
bro.

847
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:44,550
What the fuck you what?
Jessica Zebra.

848
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:49,280
I'd like to welcome you today.
My name is dyce.

849
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,333
I'm here to say I was born in Brooklyn.
Sheepshead bay come a long way to make 

850
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:55,563
your smile.
I'm going to do with different going to 

851
00:34:56,791 --> 00:34:59,060
do with dice style.
What is the,

852
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:01,510
is this playing on youtube or is it not 
true?

853
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:03,720
Was to rewind that.
Look how fucking nervous he is.

854
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:06,510
Rewind that 10 seconds.
Look,

855
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:08,260
it pulls the hand row.
Look at it.

856
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:11,640
Shake it.
I'm here to say I was born in Brooklyn.

857
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:15,180
Sheepshead bay come a long way to make 
your smile.

858
00:35:15,181 --> 00:35:18,030
I'm going to do with different going to 
do with night style.

859
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:22,010
You see him shaking?
Yeah,

860
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:24,180
that's true.
It's all bravado and then he's like,

861
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,590
shit,
I'm doing this.

862
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,160
Okay,
my Spidey,

863
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:35,160
what?
Shane up Ho Bitch.

864
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:37,980
That

865
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:40,020
was the weirdest kind of comedy that he 
could do it.

866
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:43,260
They knew what you were going to say and
they wanted to hear it start calming.

867
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,640
A complete,
original,

868
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:45,833
complete original.
If you just like people look at him 

869
00:35:47,401 --> 00:35:47,791
like,
Oh,

870
00:35:47,791 --> 00:35:52,080
brutish and disgusting and dirty jokes 
and misogynist.

871
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:53,363
All those things are true but,
but you got to realize that he 

872
00:35:55,861 --> 00:35:56,694
revolutionized like he did something but
he broke through some weird rock star 

873
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:03,780
style.
Also,

874
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,090
if you just look at it completely 
objectively,

875
00:36:06,091 --> 00:36:07,800
forget about the artistic merits of what
he did.

876
00:36:07,801 --> 00:36:08,634
He did something very different.
He figured out a way to do comedy that 

877
00:36:12,091 --> 00:36:12,924
people legitimately laughed at even 
though they knew it was coming that 

878
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,890
hadn't been done before,
that hadn't been dealt with like that.

879
00:36:19,891 --> 00:36:21,750
Never,
never.

880
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:24,450
No one yells out the punchlines in front
of the whole crowd.

881
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,820
What's in the bow bitch.

882
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,000
He needed the money.
Oh,

883
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:34,800
everybody wanted to hear the things that
he had already said,

884
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:35,693
which never existed before.
He can fucking tour with that original 

885
00:36:38,251 --> 00:36:41,580
act right now and people would be super 
satisfied,

886
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,610
let's say along with them.
Dice,

887
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:46,110
get to 10,000
seat arenas with that original act.

888
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:49,080
What's in the bow bench has not much to 
go crazy.

889
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:51,210
Nothing comedy wise,
nothing.

890
00:36:51,211 --> 00:36:53,980
It's the opposite of regular comedy.
It's the hair there,

891
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,490
but not much crushers.
Machine thing.

892
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:58,410
Yeah,
but he forces that on people.

893
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:03,600
I saw Gaffigan and at moontower once and
he did 45 minutes.

894
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:07,230
It's fine.
It was great and he does the old stuff.

895
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:08,221
Yeah.
Then he was like,

896
00:37:08,221 --> 00:37:09,480
yeah,
he introduced it like that.

897
00:37:09,481 --> 00:37:09,871
He goes,
yeah,

898
00:37:09,871 --> 00:37:11,340
I'll probably just go back to my hotel 
Roman.

899
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:15,180
When I say,
when I say burt forces on people,

900
00:37:15,181 --> 00:37:15,960
let me explain what I'm saying.

901
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:20,130
Like he like that's his signature thing.
I don't mean it like in a negative way,

902
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:22,980
but I mean like he's,
he's scared to not do that.

903
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:24,083
He wants to do that.
He wants them to know him as that 

904
00:37:25,431 --> 00:37:26,264
machine.
He wants to do that bit everywhere and 

905
00:37:27,751 --> 00:37:29,490
he feels like they get upset if he 
doesn't do it.

906
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,720
So in his head,
like he's,

907
00:37:31,721 --> 00:37:32,554
he's forcing it on them,
therefore seeing on him and it's like 

908
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:35,333
he's developed this,
everybody knows that if you're a fan of 

909
00:37:37,411 --> 00:37:38,490
Bert Kreischer,
you know the bit,

910
00:37:38,491 --> 00:37:41,280
it's a fucking amazing.
He says you want to see this?

911
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:42,900
But he's like,
do you want to see them?

912
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,360
And then he's so worried about them 
getting upset that they don't hear it,

913
00:37:45,361 --> 00:37:49,230
but he's not at all concerned with how 
they feel about him pledging $10,000

914
00:37:49,231 --> 00:37:51,000
a children's hospital and not doing it 
at all.

915
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:52,550
Just our food in the pantry.
I don't want to,

916
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:55,890
I don't want to get one.
I can't believe you brought that up.

917
00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:01,830
One of the best trolls of all time,
him on children's hospital at gray.

918
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,213
Let's,
um,

919
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:04,703
let's talk about your job.
Don't you think that that's a different 

920
00:38:08,641 --> 00:38:11,160
thing when you,
when you have a bit like a signature bit

921
00:38:11,161 --> 00:38:13,890
that you do every time you go on stage 
and people expect to hear it,

922
00:38:13,891 --> 00:38:15,980
that's a different thing.
Different thing.

923
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:16,853
Yes.
Then than regular standard comedy is 

924
00:38:17,911 --> 00:38:18,744
like when I'm watching your set,
like say if you have a new bit and I 

925
00:38:21,121 --> 00:38:22,120
haven't seen it before,
I'm,

926
00:38:22,121 --> 00:38:25,560
I get excited because I don't know where
you're going and you're taking me down a

927
00:38:25,561 --> 00:38:27,510
road and then you saw can do that 
though.

928
00:38:27,511 --> 00:38:29,370
Bobby Lee.
It's like it's just goofy.

929
00:38:29,371 --> 00:38:30,870
You just want to see him do it.
Yeah.

930
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:33,240
It certain comics that are just like,
I don't know,

931
00:38:33,241 --> 00:38:35,070
I just like seeing this over and over

932
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:37,870
in Boston,
Boston,

933
00:38:37,871 --> 00:38:40,090
like all the headliners would do the 
same act forever.

934
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,650
I know.
That's why I fuck all them.

935
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,440
Well that's why it fell apart.
Yeah,

936
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:44,060
right,
right.

937
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,910
Only only lasted for a little while like
that.

938
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:48,310
That's why it's adventure.
It's like,

939
00:38:48,311 --> 00:38:50,080
yeah,
you haven't written a case up.

940
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,380
They had the opposite of an Internet age
approach.

941
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:56,980
Their age approach was you put together 
a 45 minutes sat and that's it.

942
00:38:56,981 --> 00:38:59,170
And some of them literally only had 45 
minutes.

943
00:38:59,171 --> 00:39:02,120
They'd been doing comedy for decades 
because even with dice,

944
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:04,540
let's say you compare that to music 
where everyone's singing along with it.

945
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:05,823
Musicians have new albums and then you 
expand that catalog of stuff you can 

946
00:39:09,131 --> 00:39:11,790
sing along with,
hopefully up to a point up to a point.

947
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:14,290
And then we're rolling stones,
put some stuff out today.

948
00:39:14,291 --> 00:39:14,771
Number.
He's like,

949
00:39:14,771 --> 00:39:16,690
whatever,
brown sugar,

950
00:39:16,691 --> 00:39:17,600
come on you fuck.

951
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,480
Let me see you dance.
I heard you could still dance,

952
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,540
dude.
I went to see a look to see,

953
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:23,423
um,
uh,

954
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:24,900
rancid,
it a,

955
00:39:24,901 --> 00:39:25,990
a coney island.
Mm.

956
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:27,460
And um,
and um,

957
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:30,490
he said something,
he goes,

958
00:39:30,491 --> 00:39:30,971
uh,
hey,

959
00:39:30,971 --> 00:39:32,340
we can do some off the new album and 
stuff.

960
00:39:32,341 --> 00:39:33,490
It goes boom.
You know,

961
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:38,170
it's kind of like a of 2000 or something
like I heard you can pull if you want.

962
00:39:38,171 --> 00:39:40,720
I'm still doing it.
Fucking went into it.

963
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:42,780
That's hilarious.
Ooh,

964
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:45,880
there's something off the new one.
Boom.

965
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:47,103
It's like people are so gross.
They didn't even like internalize that 

966
00:39:51,521 --> 00:39:53,800
feeling.
They want you to react to it,

967
00:39:53,801 --> 00:39:54,634
but there's such a different thing 
between feeling something and then 

968
00:39:58,601 --> 00:40:02,980
forcing everyone around you to hear it 
and then forcing the artists to react to

969
00:40:02,981 --> 00:40:03,814
it.
There's such the levels of Douche 

970
00:40:06,071 --> 00:40:10,330
baggish nest.
It takes the critical level.

971
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:16,470
Fucking asshole.
He heard it.

972
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,270
How to say something cause it's such 
what he responded.

973
00:40:19,271 --> 00:40:22,260
So that guy wins in that world of 
Internet trolls.

974
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:25,780
If you could say something to the crowd 
in a perfect moment of silence,

975
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,970
you know,
we're just naturally comes up.

976
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:30,880
That's audience member fucking 
superbowl.

977
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:31,960
Yeah.
Yeah.

978
00:40:31,961 --> 00:40:33,260
You,
you cracked one over the thing.

979
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:36,070
Patrick Ewing was like,
I think playing the supersonics.

980
00:40:36,071 --> 00:40:39,460
This was like way after his prime.
He's just travel and how to get a couple

981
00:40:39,461 --> 00:40:41,650
extra bucks and try to maybe win a 
title.

982
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:44,410
Um,
and he went down the lane,

983
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:47,240
put up like a finger roll,
like halfway down the lane and just kind

984
00:40:47,241 --> 00:40:48,074
of went up an air ball and went out of 
bounds was a whistle only cause we went 

985
00:40:50,861 --> 00:40:51,694
out of bounds.
Whatever we thought was there a foul or 

986
00:40:52,571 --> 00:40:54,790
anything and then the rest could go out 
of balance.

987
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:57,220
And we're just a silence my friends had 
here.

988
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,220
That's it.
Somebody just go road tie.

989
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:03,910
Oh my God.
It's like sports fans.

990
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,160
The war was,
they're the worst.

991
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:08,170
They're the worst when it comes to that 
shit.

992
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:14,170
It's like they feel like since day had a
regular job and they paid a lot of money

993
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:16,720
to come see you do that.
You better fucking do it.

994
00:41:16,721 --> 00:41:17,554
Good.
There's posts you doesn't want to get 

995
00:41:18,731 --> 00:41:20,660
off the bench.
Your name about the your town,

996
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:23,590
that means the todd owns you.
It's not the fucking La Rogan's.

997
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:25,060
You know it's true.
Fuck it.

998
00:41:25,061 --> 00:41:28,030
La Lakers and they're putting out a 
shitty product.

999
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:28,903
Yeah.

1000
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,860
How's your season been these last couple
of years?

1001
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:36,380
Has it been bad?
It's been terrible.

1002
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,810
It's been terrible.
You're very excited.

1003
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:39,703
Oh,
I love it.

1004
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:41,750
Almost like nothing else I've seen.
Oh Dude.

1005
00:41:41,751 --> 00:41:45,350
I love it.
I even all my sports fans like fandom.

1006
00:41:45,351 --> 00:41:48,680
I am at most a laker hater.
Fuck them at all.

1007
00:41:48,681 --> 00:41:51,770
They're fucking fans.
You guys have one of the worst franchise

1008
00:41:51,771 --> 00:41:52,604
in basketball.
People look at you when you tried to 

1009
00:41:54,141 --> 00:41:55,910
recruit them and they go,
what the fuck are you talking about?

1010
00:41:55,911 --> 00:41:57,980
And they leave and Joyce,
showtime bitches.

1011
00:41:58,190 --> 00:41:59,870
It's been years since you've been in the
playoffs.

1012
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:02,150
No draft pick this year.
Wow.

1013
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:02,991
This is,
oh yeah,

1014
00:42:02,991 --> 00:42:04,540
it's great.
I can't understand that.

1015
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:05,383
The next big noise.
When that rapist gets into the hall of 

1016
00:42:06,531 --> 00:42:09,110
fame and all the fucking bloggers here,
pretend to forget about it again.

1017
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:11,630
Fuck all you hypocrites.
Fuck you bitches.

1018
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:14,630
All of you Lakers suck and you gotta 
deal with it.

1019
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:18,020
This is outrageous.
It's great viral team.

1020
00:42:18,021 --> 00:42:20,090
Better than yours.
Wow.

1021
00:42:20,091 --> 00:42:21,890
What team are you?
It doesn't even matter.

1022
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:22,783
The point is the Lakers suck hotels fan.
We made it stuck around for the first 

1023
00:42:26,301 --> 00:42:28,110
time in history.
Pelicans,

1024
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:31,550
newer Lens Pelicans.
How did you get to be a fan of the,

1025
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:34,250
because they started in North Carolina 
when I was there.

1026
00:42:34,251 --> 00:42:37,070
Then they moved and then they change 
their goddamn name.

1027
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:38,940
It's all a mess,
but fucks my team.

1028
00:42:38,941 --> 00:42:41,030
Since day one,
a team called the Pelican,

1029
00:42:41,031 --> 00:42:42,150
not me.
The Go,

1030
00:42:42,151 --> 00:42:42,984
the wife of the guy who owns it.
He owns a good franchise as a fucking 

1031
00:42:46,011 --> 00:42:46,844
billionaire.
Smart Guy who makes up the fucking 

1032
00:42:47,781 --> 00:42:49,190
living for himself and he's like,
oh,

1033
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:51,950
dumb fucking trophy wife.
You want to name the team?

1034
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:53,840
Then all these men have to fucking 
support.

1035
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,090
Wow.
Is that really what happened?

1036
00:42:56,091 --> 00:42:58,040
That's what happened to your variant.

1037
00:42:58,070 --> 00:42:59,960
It's fucking ridiculous.
Very upset.

1038
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:02,740
What would you have called it if you 
were at [inaudible] house?

1039
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:05,053
The bath mats.
It's a better fucking name than the 

1040
00:43:06,711 --> 00:43:08,960
Pelicans.
I had to research all the time,

1041
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:11,660
but like vicious Pelican behavior so I 
could get behind a little bit.

1042
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:13,580
They are vicious though.
Belly ducks whole.

1043
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:14,563
They'll eat ducks hole.
They'll go down there and to be no 

1044
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:19,550
ducting to go fuck off.
I'm not sure I could watch that.

1045
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:20,510
Oh,
it's great.

1046
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,430
I'm sure we're going to watch Pelikan 
eats a duck,

1047
00:43:22,431 --> 00:43:24,950
but no one thinks of that.
When you think of a Pelican,

1048
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:25,873
no.
You think of like a cute thing that 

1049
00:43:27,111 --> 00:43:28,370
brings babies.
Yeah.

1050
00:43:28,371 --> 00:43:29,260
Yeah,
let's do it.

1051
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:30,390
That store.
Oh,

1052
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:35,250
whoa,
whoa,

1053
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:38,640
whoa.
Back that up and show the golf.

1054
00:43:38,641 --> 00:43:40,760
It just shows it in there.
Wow.

1055
00:43:40,761 --> 00:43:42,440
Look at that.
Look at that.

1056
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:44,060
Trying to get away.
Look at that thing.

1057
00:43:44,061 --> 00:43:46,280
Battling it out and be like,
you ain't going anywhere.

1058
00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:47,143
My biggest made a rubber and he's just 
holding on and letting that thing pound 

1059
00:43:49,911 --> 00:43:52,640
on them.
That's crazy.

1060
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:54,830
Oh Shit.
There's a bunch of ducks.

1061
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:58,160
Evil little fucking animal.
Oh,

1062
00:43:58,161 --> 00:44:01,040
it's a seagull eating pigeons.
Siegel.

1063
00:44:01,041 --> 00:44:01,874
Each pigeons.

1064
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,770
Oh Jesus.
Wow.

1065
00:44:06,771 --> 00:44:11,140
That's God that is caused it and all 
these people.

1066
00:44:11,141 --> 00:44:12,190
You just have to watch.
Oh,

1067
00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:14,570
these little kids and I'm fucking 
bicycle boats.

1068
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:17,480
This is nuts.
I did not know seagulls did that.

1069
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:20,780
Seagulls,
Merck pigeons and eat them.

1070
00:44:21,350 --> 00:44:23,120
This is fucking know.
Oh my God.

1071
00:44:23,121 --> 00:44:23,954
Look,
it's feathers all falling off in this 

1072
00:44:24,501 --> 00:44:25,101
pitch was like,
wait,

1073
00:44:25,101 --> 00:44:28,040
what?
What birds brows were both birds.

1074
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:29,510
Oh,
he almost got away.

1075
00:44:29,511 --> 00:44:30,530
Look at this.
I found it.

1076
00:44:30,531 --> 00:44:31,690
Decapitated pigeon is

1077
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:34,450
he's trying to get away.
Look at him.

1078
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,033
Fuck you bitch.
In the street you founded decapitated 

1079
00:44:38,611 --> 00:44:40,440
one replicated.
Um,

1080
00:44:40,441 --> 00:44:43,930
you know it's usually owls that do that 
apparently attack they pipe.

1081
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:46,380
Bite their fucking heads outside of 
Ralph Hawks.

1082
00:44:46,381 --> 00:44:48,020
I'm sorry.
Yeah,

1083
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,500
hawks do it though.
There was,

1084
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:50,190
oh.
Oh.

1085
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:53,040
What happened there?
Did the bird get away?

1086
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,640
It's completely switched to different.
Oh,

1087
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,150
I got away and went after him.
Who sent this birds next.

1088
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:03,900
But it seems like he got away.
Did Not believe that.

1089
00:45:03,901 --> 00:45:05,190
That that part was fine.
Watch.

1090
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:05,941
Hold on.
No,

1091
00:45:05,941 --> 00:45:07,560
he's fucked up.
He's going to get fucked up.

1092
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:09,630
Look.
See,

1093
00:45:09,630 --> 00:45:11,640
he's swimming away.
That things right after.

1094
00:45:11,641 --> 00:45:12,690
I mean,
I ain't going anywhere.

1095
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:13,553
Thank you.
Right.

1096
00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:16,460
That's seagulls walking like Jesus on 
top of the water over it.

1097
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:18,570
I know those giant fee.
No chance.

1098
00:45:18,571 --> 00:45:19,404
That duck kind of like almost walk and 
use their wings and they can run the 

1099
00:45:23,131 --> 00:45:23,964
water.

1100
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:25,770
Yeah,
the pigeons fucked.

1101
00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:29,400
I would love to have flight.
What would you give up?

1102
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:30,780
What'd you give up?
Hearing or eyesight?

1103
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:35,070
Hearing.
You can't do flight without sight.

1104
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,181
You're fucked.
Well,

1105
00:45:36,181 --> 00:45:41,181
he could be a bat.
We get this one oof the whole duck.

1106
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:43,470
That is fucking insane,
dude.

1107
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:46,350
That's trying to drive them off the 
other ducks mad like come on and give it

1108
00:45:46,351 --> 00:45:47,930
back and forth.
Dammit.

1109
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:49,200
He's down.
He's in there.

1110
00:45:49,370 --> 00:45:50,460
Give me back my friend.
Look,

1111
00:45:50,461 --> 00:45:52,020
he's just swallows.
One more time.

1112
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:55,530
Let me see that again.
That just grabs them.

1113
00:45:56,990 --> 00:45:59,010
I call it,
call it ball.

1114
00:45:59,020 --> 00:45:59,853
I'll,
I'll look at the size of that fucking 

1115
00:46:00,901 --> 00:46:03,510
beak on that thing.
What a creepy animal.

1116
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:06,150
Yeah.
Kicking inside of his body ball.

1117
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:07,770
I'm full now.
Thank you.

1118
00:46:08,010 --> 00:46:09,990
Thank you.
I'm full Pelican.

1119
00:46:09,991 --> 00:46:12,120
Each pigeon.
St James Park in London.

1120
00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:13,410
Here we go there.
Oh,

1121
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,800
that's dark.
I bet he does it every day,

1122
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:18,900
but it looks like a monster.
He looks like a mom.

1123
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:19,734
So this all looks like normal,
normal animals that looks like on 

1124
00:46:21,811 --> 00:46:22,860
Australia type animal.

1125
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:27,330
Have you ever seen a shoe bill?
No.

1126
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:28,193
They're the creepiest bird over there.
They're a bird that lives in the Congo 

1127
00:46:30,901 --> 00:46:31,734
in Africa.
It's a fucking prehistoric dinosaurs 

1128
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:35,020
bird.
And uh,

1129
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:37,890
there's a video from the Congo.
Look at that thing.

1130
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:40,860
There's some creepy head on pictures of 
it.

1131
00:46:40,890 --> 00:46:41,723
Where you go,
what?

1132
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:44,780
God.
That one,

1133
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:46,710
that thing is a hatchet for a face,
man.

1134
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:50,640
That by the way is pretty much the 
Pelicans logo dude.

1135
00:46:50,910 --> 00:46:52,530
Well they should have made it the shoe 
bills.

1136
00:46:52,531 --> 00:46:54,850
Yeah,
they should've fucking birdman.

1137
00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:57,930
There's videos of these things.
What's it like?

1138
00:46:58,020 --> 00:46:58,853
Oh,
it's okay.

1139
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:00,420
Oh my God.
It's like,

1140
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:02,190
it keeps shifting its head back and 
forth,

1141
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:03,443
but you look at its mouth.
It's mouth is like a giant pair of 

1142
00:47:06,091 --> 00:47:07,690
scissors or something.
It's like,

1143
00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:09,003
it's creepy fucking animal do.
They left the Congo Congo there five 

1144
00:47:11,341 --> 00:47:16,341
feet tall to a giant has bird.
So that's a Bobby Lee size bird.

1145
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,230
Wow.
That's a smaller one there.

1146
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:24,150
There's a crazy video of one in the 
concepts being a snake head.

1147
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:26,130
They don't weigh that much.
Birds are pretty light.

1148
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:26,993
Even like a bigger bird,
like a Turkey that catch that fucking 

1149
00:47:28,861 --> 00:47:29,910
fish air motherfucker.

1150
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:31,390
How's he gonna throw it?
Throw.

1151
00:47:31,391 --> 00:47:34,360
It was letting them know that it's in 
the bucket.

1152
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:38,000
I just going to go for it.
Watch how they were Walkman.

1153
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:41,080
They just look creepy.
It looks like a nightmare.

1154
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:41,973
A little nothing legs.
There was a thing that was in North 

1155
00:47:44,951 --> 00:47:47,890
America millions of years ago.
At least 1 million,

1156
00:47:47,891 --> 00:47:50,200
I think they were called terror birds.
Ah,

1157
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:53,050
oh creepy.
That thing is terror birds.

1158
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:57,130
They were an enormous seven feet tall,
uh,

1159
00:47:57,190 --> 00:48:00,010
enormous birds and some of them were 
even bigger than that.

1160
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:00,933
That we're a predatory.
They're flightless birds to lived in 

1161
00:48:03,971 --> 00:48:05,440
North America.
Huge.

1162
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:05,981
Really?
Yeah,

1163
00:48:05,981 --> 00:48:06,814
like a big foot size bird that would 
probably be eat people shine huge beats 

1164
00:48:11,741 --> 00:48:12,574
like beats.
It'll literally consume half your 

1165
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:17,440
abdomen.
There were these freaky fucking animals,

1166
00:48:17,441 --> 00:48:18,274
man.
And there was a bigger one even before 

1167
00:48:19,661 --> 00:48:21,840
that.
Like one that dwarf that too.

1168
00:48:22,670 --> 00:48:24,100
That was a millions of years ago.

1169
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:26,410
See you find that fucking thing.
That's my favorite thing.

1170
00:48:26,411 --> 00:48:27,244
When they did time travel and they go 
back into prehistoric times and its 

1171
00:48:28,961 --> 00:48:30,100
opposite.
I'm like fuck,

1172
00:48:30,101 --> 00:48:32,050
everything here will kill me.
Everything.

1173
00:48:32,051 --> 00:48:34,990
God has nowhere to go.
I saw Jurassic world yesterday.

1174
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:36,250
How was it?
It's fun.

1175
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:37,233
There's,
there's definitely some cut the shit 

1176
00:48:38,291 --> 00:48:40,450
moments where it doesn't make sense.
It doesn't lie,

1177
00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:41,303
but that's,
you have to have those to make one of 

1178
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:44,050
those movies.
I'm starting to appreciate movies.

1179
00:48:44,051 --> 00:48:46,300
I'm just dumb fun.
This is what they looked like.

1180
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:48,490
Oh my gosh,
look at that fucking thing.

1181
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:49,863
So that was running around,
I think it was a North American animal 

1182
00:48:51,881 --> 00:48:54,380
to that looks like it was running up to 
the car look.

1183
00:48:54,381 --> 00:48:55,214
So it's chasing after elk and shit but 
there's look it go to the upper right 

1184
00:48:57,641 --> 00:49:00,400
hand drawing the upper right hand one.
It shows you how big they were.

1185
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:03,550
They were fucking enormous.
Oh Wow.

1186
00:49:03,551 --> 00:49:04,990
Way better than human.
Yeah.

1187
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:07,090
And then there was ones that were even 
bigger than that.

1188
00:49:07,091 --> 00:49:07,924
Those are the two biggest ones.
I liked this one because they put the 

1189
00:49:09,521 --> 00:49:12,130
human like the outline of the human.
But he's holding a machine gun.

1190
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:14,950
Fire them off.
She imagined that thing run.

1191
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,300
Even if you had a machine gun and you'd 
be like,

1192
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:20,030
Ooh,
you got an and running.

1193
00:49:20,070 --> 00:49:20,903
Yeah.
Look how many of them there were 

1194
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:25,930
different kinds of enormous birds that 
giant ostriches and shit.

1195
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:27,340
Oh my gosh.
Yeah.

1196
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:28,390
There,
I mean,

1197
00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:29,283
that fucking thing.
The really big one that's in the 

1198
00:49:30,761 --> 00:49:31,594
foreground with that reddish beak.
What a fucking creepy thing that would 

1199
00:49:34,811 --> 00:49:35,644
be.
If you're walking through a field and 

1200
00:49:36,581 --> 00:49:41,500
you saw this nine foot plus tall freaky 
ass bird staring at you,

1201
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:43,870
it doesn't even fly.
It's just a,

1202
00:49:43,871 --> 00:49:45,880
it's just an armless eating machine.

1203
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:47,620
I mean,
you can call it a bird,

1204
00:49:47,621 --> 00:49:49,810
but they can't fly.
They have any wings.

1205
00:49:49,811 --> 00:49:51,130
Really.
They're weird.

1206
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:55,240
They have giant talents.
What they are as a fucking dinosaur.

1207
00:49:55,330 --> 00:49:56,163
Right.
There's some weird ass dinosaur that 

1208
00:49:58,991 --> 00:50:02,680
made it to a 2018 you know?
That's like a big theory.

1209
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,380
It's a big thing.
It's being debated amongst the birds are

1210
00:50:05,381 --> 00:50:06,214
dinosaurs.
Yeah.

1211
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:07,203
They really think that it's quite 
possible that a lot of those dinosaurs 

1212
00:50:09,521 --> 00:50:10,850
had feathers.
Yeah.

1213
00:50:10,870 --> 00:50:12,760
I became birds.
They are birds.

1214
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:14,170
Yeah.
Like all over their body.

1215
00:50:14,171 --> 00:50:15,940
They were like,
when we look at a t rex,

1216
00:50:16,090 --> 00:50:17,440
he might've been covered in feathers.
Oh,

1217
00:50:17,441 --> 00:50:18,620
that would've been cool.
Yeah,

1218
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:19,840
we don't know.
They know.

1219
00:50:19,841 --> 00:50:20,674
Some of them definitely were though.
They're finding some of them covered in 

1220
00:50:23,171 --> 00:50:25,510
feathers.
These mikes are great.

1221
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:27,620
They're not bad.
It's still picks you up like way back.

1222
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:28,050
Little

1223
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:29,290
pretty good,
but not,

1224
00:50:29,330 --> 00:50:31,280
it doesn't pick up too much bullshit in 
the background.

1225
00:50:31,281 --> 00:50:34,430
We've tried other ones that like pick up
shit in the background too much.

1226
00:50:34,431 --> 00:50:36,890
Like if you moved some things over here 
it would be too loud.

1227
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:37,783
Yeah,
it's,

1228
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:38,743
some of them are Jamie,
you can explain what are the ones that 

1229
00:50:40,641 --> 00:50:41,474
are like,
they literally pick up every sound in 

1230
00:50:42,411 --> 00:50:43,244
the room,
the pickup pattern and whatnot at the 

1231
00:50:46,290 --> 00:50:48,110
preamp on.
This isn't up very loud.

1232
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:49,370
Oh,
it's up loud,

1233
00:50:49,371 --> 00:50:50,300
but it's not.
So yeah,

1234
00:50:50,301 --> 00:50:51,134
this,
this Mike needs a preamp because it has 

1235
00:50:52,521 --> 00:50:53,354
a very low nominal level.
If you don't know what that means at 

1236
00:50:56,091 --> 00:50:56,924
all.
I am in podcasting and I have no idea 

1237
00:50:58,461 --> 00:51:01,000
what you're talking about.
Famous dropping some audio knowledge.

1238
00:51:01,190 --> 00:51:03,410
I just want a bike to be able to do the 
thing where you talk,

1239
00:51:03,411 --> 00:51:05,510
like you're in a car driving by a line 
where you're like,

1240
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:06,693
hey everybody,
maybe later we'll go to the store and 

1241
00:51:07,551 --> 00:51:09,280
then we'll get that sound.

1242
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:12,470
Does that sound I supposed to sound like
the jobs off debt with a pan.

1243
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:14,490
I could do that right now actually.
Oh really?

1244
00:51:14,491 --> 00:51:14,930
Yeah,
but,

1245
00:51:14,930 --> 00:51:18,500
but you'd have to do that with software.
You wouldn't be doing that with just the

1246
00:51:18,501 --> 00:51:20,300
microphone.
We and not with just the microphone.

1247
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:21,793
That's the worst.
Where do you think you would fucking 

1248
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:24,790
getting the line and you'd like yell 
something at them,

1249
00:51:24,830 --> 00:51:27,390
but then when you're in the line,
do you realize all you hear is yeah,

1250
00:51:27,410 --> 00:51:29,350
definitely.
Yeah.

1251
00:51:29,450 --> 00:51:30,620
It's a Phoenix Shit.
Yeah.

1252
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:33,500
What'd he say?
You'd have to actually get your body out

1253
00:51:33,501 --> 00:51:34,334
the window and yell.
[inaudible] otherwise it sounds just 

1254
00:51:36,891 --> 00:51:39,470
coming out in a weird way.
We're boxy.

1255
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:40,880
Pattern.
You remember dirty work,

1256
00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:42,240
dirty word?
Um,

1257
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:44,190
yeah.
With form and are already already.

1258
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:45,980
Yeah.
He does that to a lie to you.

1259
00:51:46,090 --> 00:51:46,923
I can move them.
He moves the line already and then he 

1260
00:51:48,651 --> 00:51:49,484
just pulls over.

1261
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:51,010
He's like,
I was,

1262
00:51:51,011 --> 00:51:52,640
uh,
I supposed to keep driving.

1263
00:51:53,770 --> 00:51:54,603
Sorry.
Everybody.

1264
00:51:56,240 --> 00:52:00,440
Did you see the pictures have already 
been waltzing already?

1265
00:52:00,441 --> 00:52:04,070
Haven't seen him around.
His nose is all fucked up and it's caved

1266
00:52:04,071 --> 00:52:05,360
in it.
Well,

1267
00:52:05,390 --> 00:52:08,450
I guess he snorted something and he got 
an infection.

1268
00:52:08,570 --> 00:52:11,660
A vague sense knows was huge.
It was weird.

1269
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:13,370
Yeah,
it's pretty big.

1270
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:15,333
It's like,
wow.

1271
00:52:16,070 --> 00:52:17,690
Yeah.
Look at that right there.

1272
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:19,093
Oh yeah,
that one.

1273
00:52:19,990 --> 00:52:21,800
Yeah.
What is going with the Rd legs?

1274
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:23,080
Notes?
Yeah.

1275
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:24,950
Something's happening with such a good 
guy.

1276
00:52:24,990 --> 00:52:28,070
He's a great,
he's a really good pool player.

1277
00:52:28,370 --> 00:52:29,203
Is it really?
I can be.

1278
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:30,253
He's real good.
He's more than anybody like refused to 

1279
00:52:32,541 --> 00:52:33,374
accept that he's famous,
so he just like walks around normal and 

1280
00:52:35,091 --> 00:52:36,170
then people will start barking.
I was like,

1281
00:52:36,171 --> 00:52:37,640
oh yeah,
they kind of like goes away.

1282
00:52:37,641 --> 00:52:40,490
But like he just goes in a normal 
environments all the time.

1283
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:44,990
He's a good dude.
Really is really good guy.

1284
00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:48,230
He is not making 20,
20.

1285
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,900
I don't think so.
No Way.

1286
00:52:51,470 --> 00:52:53,900
He has no,
no desire to quit.

1287
00:52:54,050 --> 00:52:55,490
He's just,
he's riding it out.

1288
00:52:55,970 --> 00:52:57,560
Did he quit for a while?
They,

1289
00:52:57,590 --> 00:52:59,180
I think every once in a while.
I don't really know.

1290
00:52:59,181 --> 00:53:02,060
I think every once in a while,
like he gets cleaned from ray,

1291
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:04,040
but it's like he doesn't really white,
just wants to cut,

1292
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:04,953
pull it back a little.
Sometimes he's never gonna be one of 

1293
00:53:07,161 --> 00:53:07,871
those guys like,
yeah,

1294
00:53:07,871 --> 00:53:09,290
I haven't touched this stuff in five 
years.

1295
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:11,900
Yeah.
I don't think he's interested in that.

1296
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:15,860
He's enjoying himself.
That's what Mitch Hedberg said before he

1297
00:53:15,861 --> 00:53:17,720
died.
Apparently they're trying to get them to

1298
00:53:17,721 --> 00:53:18,321
clean up.
He's like,

1299
00:53:18,321 --> 00:53:20,210
I'm not doing shit.
I like it.

1300
00:53:20,390 --> 00:53:21,223
Yeah.
It's like when you tell people quit 

1301
00:53:22,281 --> 00:53:23,000
smoking,
like,

1302
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,860
why I'm not desiring quitting.

1303
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:25,920
Right.
You guys are,

1304
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:29,250
yeah.
That's a hard pill for people to swallow

1305
00:53:29,251 --> 00:53:31,800
that don't do it.
Yeah.

1306
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:32,740
You know,
like,

1307
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:33,660
oh yeah,
just quit.

1308
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:34,673
You should just quit.
Do when you see those gacked out people 

1309
00:53:36,121 --> 00:53:37,620
on the sidewalk in New York,
you know,

1310
00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:39,390
just fucking standing up,
you know,

1311
00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:42,030
those doubt or something like that.
Or just like pat,

1312
00:53:42,190 --> 00:53:43,023
you know,
nodding off in their own whatever tech 

1313
00:53:44,191 --> 00:53:45,060
day time you're like,
wow,

1314
00:53:45,061 --> 00:53:47,250
they're fucked up.
But now that I've done enough drugs,

1315
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:52,520
you realize like loving it right now 
they are having the best time.

1316
00:53:53,241 --> 00:53:55,490
They're peaking.
It looks Shitty,

1317
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:56,353
but the pig and when they come to with 
shitting their pants and nowhere where 

1318
00:53:57,861 --> 00:53:58,641
to go.
All right.

1319
00:53:58,641 --> 00:54:02,290
The best but can superbowl tweaking.
Yeah.

1320
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:04,180
Their experience is amazing.
Yeah.

1321
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:05,690
They're,
they're a here in Lucy,

1322
00:54:05,691 --> 00:54:07,550
in the sky with diamonds.
Oh God.

1323
00:54:07,950 --> 00:54:09,050
Sam The sky

1324
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:14,610
and then just sitting there.
Oh,

1325
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,860
just trippin.
Oh,

1326
00:54:24,450 --> 00:54:25,920
forgot to tell you this.
Well,

1327
00:54:26,370 --> 00:54:27,203
so when I was,
I was having some pretty good thoughts 

1328
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,560
on this.
Acid watches from different paths of the

1329
00:54:30,561 --> 00:54:32,150
killers by the way,
fucking killed him.

1330
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:34,440
Hmm.
Um,

1331
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:35,893
sorry.
You see stuff in like when you're out 

1332
00:54:37,831 --> 00:54:38,581
there,
it's like a dog.

1333
00:54:38,581 --> 00:54:39,414
So a truth,
I call them universal truths where you 

1334
00:54:41,101 --> 00:54:42,390
just like,
yes,

1335
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:43,800
that is real.
That is right.

1336
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:44,813
100%.
And it's hard to bring that shit back 

1337
00:54:46,771 --> 00:54:48,390
into this realm,
you know,

1338
00:54:48,391 --> 00:54:49,224
to understand it and trying to get us 
kicked off of youtube that it's passing 

1339
00:54:53,971 --> 00:54:54,804
car.
So it's hard when you come back to be 

1340
00:54:56,231 --> 00:54:56,521
like,
oh,

1341
00:54:56,521 --> 00:54:59,730
I saw the truth of something and then 
it's like you can't express it.

1342
00:54:59,731 --> 00:55:01,110
And when people come back,
when they're around you,

1343
00:55:01,111 --> 00:55:02,520
they say something and you're like,
what?

1344
00:55:02,530 --> 00:55:04,350
And they're like,
they realize I get frustrated.

1345
00:55:04,351 --> 00:55:05,440
They're not saying it right.
Yeah.

1346
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:07,170
And then it's slowly going away.
Yeah.

1347
00:55:07,950 --> 00:55:08,783
So when I was there in that place,
sometimes I try to remember like when 

1348
00:55:13,421 --> 00:55:15,250
you get back,
say this to this person,

1349
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:21,300
so that state told me to tell you m and 
m is one of the real estate amps is

1350
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:26,590
okay.

1351
00:55:26,590 --> 00:55:30,820
I'm not going to argue with it.
I don't know what exactly,

1352
00:55:32,770 --> 00:55:35,710
but it was like,
does that could be a funny bit,

1353
00:55:35,711 --> 00:55:37,150
dude,
this is a funny bit in there,

1354
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:40,690
like about how like some things are just
in the moment.

1355
00:55:40,691 --> 00:55:44,220
They seem so profound.
So rob,

1356
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:46,180
you're like,
what the fuck is wrong with me?

1357
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:49,480
M and ms one of the real MCS.
Why I would agree with that.

1358
00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:50,351
Oh,
so he's very,

1359
00:55:50,351 --> 00:55:52,480
very real.
It seems fairly real.

1360
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:54,700
Yeah.
Right.

1361
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:55,990
Yeah,
and as I heard it,

1362
00:55:55,991 --> 00:55:56,824
I was like,
that's going to sound dumb in the real 

1363
00:55:57,761 --> 00:55:59,380
world.
But I was like,

1364
00:55:59,381 --> 00:56:00,520
all right.
What did you think of that?

1365
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:04,090
B e t music awards thing he did where he
was like freestyle,

1366
00:56:04,830 --> 00:56:05,800
right?
Well,

1367
00:56:05,801 --> 00:56:06,820
no,
some people liked it.

1368
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:08,600
Some people liked it.
Did they?

1369
00:56:08,601 --> 00:56:12,920
The anti trump thing.
Everybody gets old.

1370
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,330
It was interested.
It's good old.

1371
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:15,680
Yeah.
But he was,

1372
00:56:15,870 --> 00:56:16,703
no,
he was angry and he had all of his 

1373
00:56:18,330 --> 00:56:19,920
friends around him.
Yeah.

1374
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:20,813
That was the weird thing.
Like why are all those dudes just 

1375
00:56:21,781 --> 00:56:23,650
standing around kissing?
No,

1376
00:56:23,670 --> 00:56:24,100
those,
they're

1377
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:26,440
all just hanging around these cars like 
in a circle.

1378
00:56:26,730 --> 00:56:30,070
They're all waiting while eminem wraps.
So he's got like all these,

1379
00:56:30,850 --> 00:56:32,290
that's what they,
it's the rap cypher.

1380
00:56:32,291 --> 00:56:34,150
That's what they all take turns.
Oh really?

1381
00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:35,470
They all did it.
Does that mean I'm just turn?

1382
00:56:35,471 --> 00:56:37,000
Yeah,
but where's the other ones?

1383
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:38,290
The videos.
The other guys too.

1384
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:41,410
My name is far better.
One guy steps forward.

1385
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:44,020
I need to understand rap culture better.
Definitely.

1386
00:56:44,110 --> 00:56:48,430
Almost said rape culture,
b e t awards show.

1387
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:50,980
Oh,
that's how they do it.

1388
00:56:50,981 --> 00:56:51,814
They did at the bet awards show.
It's like a thing that they find it a 

1389
00:56:53,261 --> 00:56:55,930
fucking parking lot.
Parking lot,

1390
00:56:55,931 --> 00:56:56,764
but the various different groups have 
different labels maybe would have taken 

1391
00:57:01,061 --> 00:57:03,490
that put up their own guys.
It's called keeping it street.

1392
00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:07,580
Really interesting actually are not 
street God,

1393
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:08,433
you don't know anything.
That's why they had to tell you that m 

1394
00:57:10,290 --> 00:57:11,123
two m and m's,
one of the real estate MCS I already 

1395
00:57:13,001 --> 00:57:14,950
knew.
He keeps it street.

1396
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:16,690
But uh,
that thing was,

1397
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:18,790
it was interesting.
It's like when people,

1398
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:22,870
you know,
when you create this big explosion,

1399
00:57:22,871 --> 00:57:26,770
this attack on someone from someplace,
that's always fascinating to me to watch

1400
00:57:26,771 --> 00:57:27,970
that go down.
Like,

1401
00:57:27,971 --> 00:57:29,320
what's someone doing here?
Like what,

1402
00:57:29,650 --> 00:57:30,850
what's happening here?
What's,

1403
00:57:30,851 --> 00:57:31,684
what are you,
what is your sport?

1404
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:32,533
What's your take on it?

1405
00:57:34,590 --> 00:57:36,060
It wasn't as best work.
Right,

1406
00:57:36,061 --> 00:57:36,980
right.
You know,

1407
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,190
I mean,
I think he's an amazing rapper.

1408
00:57:39,191 --> 00:57:42,910
Like some of his shit from the past is 
fucking incredible freestyle.

1409
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:45,940
Well first of all,
I'm not feeling that gold chain.

1410
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:52,060
Jamie's like put that three styles 
anymore.

1411
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:54,580
It's not freestyle,
it's just not,

1412
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:57,270
I don't even hear it was freestyle.
Things are free.

1413
00:57:57,370 --> 00:57:59,380
I feel like you write up a lot of those.
Oh,

1414
00:57:59,381 --> 00:58:01,460
you got good again,
practice to man.

1415
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:02,343
I liked the Cadillac in the back.
I'll tell you that I got a boner for 

1416
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,250
lack on the right.
Yeah.

1417
00:58:06,251 --> 00:58:07,084
That looks like,
what is that like a 70 something 

1418
00:58:08,681 --> 00:58:11,680
cadillac that things fucking beautiful.
Oh,

1419
00:58:11,681 --> 00:58:14,830
I love those things.
I don't give a fuck about this rap,

1420
00:58:14,831 --> 00:58:19,000
but that Cadillac is the shit.
I got a boner for old cars,

1421
00:58:19,001 --> 00:58:19,834
dude.
I'm one of those old dudes that likes 

1422
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:24,280
old music and old cars.

1423
00:58:24,510 --> 00:58:25,331
Do you see,
um,

1424
00:58:25,331 --> 00:58:26,950
that that rap would,
it's like a,

1425
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:27,813
I forgot who it was,
but it was like saying from the white 

1426
00:58:29,171 --> 00:58:32,200
point of view about what the form of 
black people and then from a black point

1427
00:58:32,201 --> 00:58:35,640
of view as far with white people,
video is somebody like lips.

1428
00:58:35,641 --> 00:58:37,720
I can pretty well something,
I'm like redneck dude.

1429
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:39,433
It's like black people always complained
about this and this and then it goes 

1430
00:58:41,171 --> 00:58:42,010
back.
Hmm.

1431
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:43,610
I forgot who it is,
young something.

1432
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:45,273
But the problem with black people and 
white people is that people say black 

1433
00:58:49,391 --> 00:58:51,270
people and white just people.
Yeah.

1434
00:58:51,350 --> 00:58:53,320
Instead of just people.
I was watching this video,

1435
00:58:54,070 --> 00:58:54,903
it's annoying video of this lady calling
the cops and this little eight year old 

1436
00:58:57,431 --> 00:59:02,180
black girl who's selling water,
they've seen it viral viral video,

1437
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:04,780
supposed to sell water.
She's calling the fucking police.

1438
00:59:04,781 --> 00:59:05,614
She St selling water without a permit 
and her mom videotapes her and puts it 

1439
00:59:08,921 --> 00:59:10,060
up and makes it viral.

1440
00:59:11,110 --> 00:59:15,400
And that's one of those videos where 
it's everything's in the right place.

1441
00:59:15,730 --> 00:59:16,563
The white lady is overweight.
She's just angry looking like you're 

1442
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:20,673
overweight white lady.
The little black girl is cute as a 

1443
00:59:23,481 --> 00:59:26,140
button.
The mom is uh,

1444
00:59:26,210 --> 00:59:30,440
the mom is talking to where in a way 
that's like not too aggressive.

1445
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:31,453
She goes,
she out here calling the police on a 

1446
00:59:32,391 --> 00:59:34,910
little girl trying to sell water.
We see you boo.

1447
00:59:35,060 --> 00:59:35,893
Like she's not being horrible and 
everything just fell into place to this 

1448
00:59:39,061 --> 00:59:42,620
like perfect example of like what's 
happening here?

1449
00:59:42,650 --> 00:59:43,483
Like is this racism or is this someone 
who's just just complains about 

1450
00:59:47,481 --> 00:59:48,314
everything,
which she be doing that for an eight 

1451
00:59:49,341 --> 00:59:50,380
year old little.
I don't know.

1452
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:51,253
That's why I hear the argument a lot of 
like you wouldn't do this if it was a 

1453
00:59:53,181 --> 00:59:54,860
man you want to be.
This was a woman you want to go,

1454
00:59:54,890 --> 00:59:55,400
this was black.

1455
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:57,500
But it's like you're not basing on what 
the next set of,

1456
00:59:57,890 --> 00:59:59,870
it's just like one example for us.
One example,

1457
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:01,640
well you're not pro,
there's no proof.

1458
01:00:01,810 --> 01:00:04,850
You wouldn't have done that eight year 
old White Hills Chamber of commerce.

1459
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:07,280
And whenever somebody wanted to do 
seeding,

1460
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:08,570
like,
like sidewalk seating,

1461
01:00:08,571 --> 01:00:09,404
they had to get through,
but all it would take is one housewife 

1462
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:15,110
from the area to get a stick up their 
ass about the rules and say no,

1463
01:00:15,230 --> 01:00:17,390
no.
And then it'll be done by 8:00

1464
01:00:17,390 --> 01:00:21,650
PM there won't be any hurt on the,
on the people around us when lean up.

1465
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:22,910
And if she goes no,
that,

1466
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:26,180
it's like 24 more hoops to jump,
you know?

1467
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:27,193
And it's just because he's housewives 
have nothing to do better than new 

1468
01:00:29,661 --> 01:00:33,020
enforce rules.
So it could be that could be fucked.

1469
01:00:33,021 --> 01:00:34,190
These black kids.
I don't,

1470
01:00:34,191 --> 01:00:35,450
I don't,
I don't have any idea.

1471
01:00:35,510 --> 01:00:38,660
She was on the um,
on an interview talking about it,

1472
01:00:38,661 --> 01:00:39,494
which is a terrible idea by the way.
The white lady and she put all this 

1473
01:00:42,261 --> 01:00:44,350
makeup on and everything,
which is also a terrible,

1474
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:46,860
but mimi from drew carey show,
it was just not good.

1475
01:00:46,890 --> 01:00:47,641
Like,
oh my God.

1476
01:00:47,641 --> 01:00:48,750
And went with it.
You carry right.

1477
01:00:49,790 --> 01:00:51,020
I forgot about her.
Um,

1478
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:52,063
but the whole thing was she was saying 
that she was working and that she had 

1479
01:00:56,391 --> 01:00:57,224
the window open.
The little girl was shouting and 

1480
01:00:58,461 --> 01:00:59,294
screaming.
She was trying to make it look bad as 

1481
01:01:00,831 --> 01:01:01,780
possible.
Yes.

1482
01:01:01,781 --> 01:01:02,614
She was a victim and she said she 
apologized to both the little girl and 

1483
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:06,770
the mom,
but they won't accept her apology,

1484
01:01:07,430 --> 01:01:08,263
which is like,
okay,

1485
01:01:08,870 --> 01:01:10,000
well,
you know,

1486
01:01:10,001 --> 01:01:11,630
there's nothing wrong with accepting 
someone's apology.

1487
01:01:11,631 --> 01:01:12,464
Clearly she shouldn't have done that.
Like he shouldn't tell a little eight 

1488
01:01:14,721 --> 01:01:16,460
year old and not sell water on a hot 
day.

1489
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:17,293
Who gives a fuck?
Like that doesn't make any [inaudible] 

1490
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:20,061
just going,
hey,

1491
01:01:20,061 --> 01:01:22,070
come on guys.
It's all screen by my window.

1492
01:01:22,370 --> 01:01:23,203
Yeah,
like maybe she was saying that it was a 

1493
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:27,790
hot day and so she had her window rolled
down.

1494
01:01:27,810 --> 01:01:30,590
The kid was screaming,
but apparently she didn't talk to them.

1495
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:32,750
She didn't talk to the kid and she 
didn't talk to the mom.

1496
01:01:32,751 --> 01:01:35,720
It's just called the police went outside
a so antisocial.

1497
01:01:35,770 --> 01:01:37,850
Just go straight to like someone to deal
with it instead of just like,

1498
01:01:37,851 --> 01:01:38,684
hey.
It's like when you get a note in your 

1499
01:01:39,381 --> 01:01:41,780
apartment door saying something,
it's like just or the front door.

1500
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:43,040
You're like,
just come to my apartment.

1501
01:01:43,041 --> 01:01:44,990
Knock.
Just ask once.

1502
01:01:44,991 --> 01:01:48,620
Just try it humanity once and then go to
the other step.

1503
01:01:48,650 --> 01:01:49,483
So they compared her with this white 
chick hit called on Chicago police on 

1504
01:01:53,721 --> 01:01:55,580
the barbecue and did the same person.

1505
01:01:56,180 --> 01:01:57,220
Not really,
but yes,

1506
01:01:57,860 --> 01:02:01,540
it's like that.
She's doubling down.

1507
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:05,210
That's just going forward.
They look so similar man.

1508
01:02:05,211 --> 01:02:07,900
Like in the way the shape of their body.
Housewife,

1509
01:02:07,901 --> 01:02:08,400
it's,
Yep,

1510
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,940
it's Adelaide's white housewife.
It's a fucking Shitty,

1511
01:02:10,941 --> 01:02:12,920
the worst position to be in in the 
world.

1512
01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:16,540
There's definitely work to do there.
Look,

1513
01:02:16,670 --> 01:02:18,140
come on.
Come on.

1514
01:02:18,141 --> 01:02:18,974
Look at the two of them together.
They're both on the phone with these 

1515
01:02:21,121 --> 01:02:25,710
like sexually ambiguous forms,
like you know that that's a woman,

1516
01:02:25,711 --> 01:02:30,120
but you know both of them there,
they're overweight and it's just weird.

1517
01:02:30,450 --> 01:02:31,290
It's weird.
They're like,

1518
01:02:31,420 --> 01:02:33,690
clearly you see that I'm going to go out
on a limb.

1519
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:34,553
I don't think most,
I will say most people that are shaped 

1520
01:02:36,781 --> 01:02:39,210
like that don't feel good.
I don't feel good.

1521
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:41,970
They don't feel good right there.
They're upset at stuff.

1522
01:02:42,250 --> 01:02:43,083
They ever,
ever have somebody screaming about 

1523
01:02:43,981 --> 01:02:45,390
something like,
you're not supposed to set waters here,

1524
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:48,450
but there's meet them with like,
what happened to you?

1525
01:02:48,930 --> 01:02:50,570
What are you still angry but you're 
supposed to.

1526
01:02:50,580 --> 01:02:51,301
I was like,
sure.

1527
01:02:51,301 --> 01:02:52,080
Okay,
I'll get to that.

1528
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:54,510
So why are you so mad selling water 
without a permit?

1529
01:02:55,470 --> 01:02:58,200
I got a discussion with someone at 
twitter way back about that guy,

1530
01:02:58,201 --> 01:03:00,450
Michael Brown.
I can't breathe.

1531
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:01,313
What's that?
Michael Brown?

1532
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:04,880
Eric Garner was Eric Garner.
Yeah.

1533
01:03:05,330 --> 01:03:06,180
And somebody is like,
yeah.

1534
01:03:06,181 --> 01:03:08,750
What's your understand is I have a 
business and like I sell it.

1535
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:09,593
Let's say I sell cigarettes.
I'm somebody undercutting me with no 

1536
01:03:11,281 --> 01:03:13,260
permits right outside that really hurts 
my business.

1537
01:03:13,261 --> 01:03:13,741
And I was like,
okay,

1538
01:03:13,741 --> 01:03:14,574
sure,
I'll give you that.

1539
01:03:14,730 --> 01:03:17,670
Do you think the punishment for that 
should be choking someone?

1540
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:20,040
Maybe till I can't breathe.
And he's like,

1541
01:03:20,070 --> 01:03:20,701
oh no,
no.

1542
01:03:20,701 --> 01:03:22,400
That's too much of a punishment.
Yeah.

1543
01:03:22,410 --> 01:03:23,010
Okay.
All right.

1544
01:03:23,010 --> 01:03:23,843
Well here's the problem with that.
The official version of that is that he 

1545
01:03:28,441 --> 01:03:31,260
didn't have any cigarettes on him.
They did not know he had nothing.

1546
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:32,750
He had nothing.
What?

1547
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:33,181
Yeah,
no,

1548
01:03:33,181 --> 01:03:35,820
he had nothing when they had arrested 
him before for that,

1549
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:39,240
but he was clean.
So all have cigarettes.

1550
01:03:39,241 --> 01:03:40,980
Who's telling him leave him the fuck 
alone?

1551
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:42,050
He's like,
y'all was out here.

1552
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:42,690
Fuck with me.

1553
01:03:42,690 --> 01:03:45,480
Just leave me the fuck alone.
They started by wanting to frisk him and

1554
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:47,240
there was for no reason.
Oh my God,

1555
01:03:47,241 --> 01:03:49,410
I've been sick.
It just one sentence is still too much.

1556
01:03:49,620 --> 01:03:50,850
It's like,
just give me the ticket bit.

1557
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:52,140
Yes,
they shouldn't touch them.

1558
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:53,670
I mean,
and he wasn't a violent guy,

1559
01:03:53,671 --> 01:03:56,000
wasn't like,
like threatening them and some sort of a

1560
01:03:56,001 --> 01:03:56,790
way.
And,

1561
01:03:56,790 --> 01:03:59,970
and then they tried to say that it 
wasn't a chokehold pitch.

1562
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:03,090
Let me put you in that.
Did I pass by the two cops that I wanted

1563
01:04:03,091 --> 01:04:03,924
to?
Uh,

1564
01:04:04,010 --> 01:04:05,910
they were,
one was sec right after that in New York

1565
01:04:05,950 --> 01:04:07,040
was like,
that's not a choke hold.

1566
01:04:07,050 --> 01:04:08,160
And I want,
I wanted to stop and go,

1567
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:09,113
actually I'm friends with an expert on 
the subject and he does say that 

1568
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:13,160
chocolate chip called a choking to death
like that.

1569
01:04:13,161 --> 01:04:14,730
Yeah.
I will choke you to death with that.

1570
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:18,240
How's that underneath clothes?
And he's got his hands grip that is like

1571
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:19,193
the same vr.
It's a backwards version of what you 

1572
01:04:20,911 --> 01:04:23,090
would call it.
A Marcello Garcia Guillotine,

1573
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:24,113
which means like there's certain guys 
that are really good at getting the 

1574
01:04:26,041 --> 01:04:28,500
blade of the forum across your 
esophagus.

1575
01:04:28,530 --> 01:04:30,550
It's very painful.
And um,

1576
01:04:30,690 --> 01:04:34,740
like some of like Amal Easton taught me 
how to do this and shout out to boulder,

1577
01:04:34,741 --> 01:04:35,574
Colorado,
a Amal Easton is a Jujitsu coach and 

1578
01:04:37,591 --> 01:04:38,424
he's got a fantastic guillotine.
And one of the things about his 

1579
01:04:41,161 --> 01:04:41,994
guillotine is he knows how to get that 
blade of that bolt right into your 

1580
01:04:45,601 --> 01:04:47,070
esophagus.
It's horrific.

1581
01:04:47,071 --> 01:04:47,904
It feels terrible.
And they do it like with the high 

1582
01:04:49,081 --> 01:04:50,910
elbows,
he can't escape it.

1583
01:04:50,911 --> 01:04:53,190
It's and it,
it's an immediate feeling.

1584
01:04:53,670 --> 01:04:56,930
That guy has his forearm right across 
that guys throat.

1585
01:04:56,931 --> 01:04:58,740
Yeah.
There's no doubt about it.

1586
01:04:58,741 --> 01:05:01,050
If I'm holding that like that and I'm 
clan,

1587
01:05:01,140 --> 01:05:04,320
he has his hands clasped together.
Can you make it a little bigger so I can

1588
01:05:04,321 --> 01:05:07,710
see you and this is how right hand 
resist like easy,

1589
01:05:07,711 --> 01:05:09,750
but you could still choke someone out 
even if it's,

1590
01:05:09,751 --> 01:05:11,310
hey,
I can't tell if his hands are connected.

1591
01:05:11,311 --> 01:05:13,230
I think they are.
It looks like he's got a man inside.

1592
01:05:13,231 --> 01:05:14,064
His hair garners a hundred percent a 
hundred percent and and his arms behind 

1593
01:05:16,831 --> 01:05:18,070
his too.
But the point

1594
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:20,860
is the guy was choking him.
The way he's doing that,

1595
01:05:20,861 --> 01:05:22,810
you could choke a guy like that with one
arm.

1596
01:05:22,990 --> 01:05:24,730
You don't even have to have that right 
arm in play.

1597
01:05:24,910 --> 01:05:27,390
If he's got that left arm underneath the
neck like that.

1598
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:31,420
All his dude's hooked the the back of 
the head or the shoulder rather.

1599
01:05:31,421 --> 01:05:34,900
The traps you if you want your arms 
along from San Jose,

1600
01:05:35,350 --> 01:05:38,560
he got somebody on a one shields.
Yeah.

1601
01:05:38,561 --> 01:05:40,030
Jake.
Do anybody like that?

1602
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:41,670
Tito Ortiz did that,
uh,

1603
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:45,100
in the UFC before he choke somebody out 
with a one armed t t um,

1604
01:05:45,130 --> 01:05:46,780
Luke rockhold did.
It's a Michael Bisping.

1605
01:05:47,050 --> 01:05:50,230
He got him in a mounted a one armed a 
guillotine.

1606
01:05:50,860 --> 01:05:52,030
I mean,
here's the problem.

1607
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:53,800
Why don't the other cops that would go,
hey,

1608
01:05:53,801 --> 01:05:55,060
tell me that's enough.
Yeah.

1609
01:05:55,230 --> 01:05:57,040
Listen man,
that's a God damn choke hold.

1610
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:58,570
I know.
Choke holds.

1611
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:01,150
I commentate him on for a fucking 
living.

1612
01:06:01,180 --> 01:06:03,880
That's chokehold and if you don't think 
it's a choke hold,

1613
01:06:03,881 --> 01:06:06,310
let me put you in it.
Let me put you in it and to see how long

1614
01:06:06,311 --> 01:06:08,450
you last.
What's it fucking choke hold?

1615
01:06:09,690 --> 01:06:14,690
Have you been a lot of big up here?
That guy's been calling you out.

1616
01:06:15,401 --> 01:06:17,230
Have you talked about it?
Alex Jones?

1617
01:06:17,290 --> 01:06:18,700
No.
Fighter.

1618
01:06:19,270 --> 01:06:20,570
Which one?
Oh,

1619
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:23,590
Colby.
Colby is funny man.

1620
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:25,720
I know.
Colby.

1621
01:06:25,721 --> 01:06:26,554
And I also know very well one of colby 
is really good friends is my friend Cam 

1622
01:06:31,030 --> 01:06:31,710
Haines.
They'll really,

1623
01:06:31,710 --> 01:06:34,750
they're live in the same town.
Why is this fine with you?

1624
01:06:34,870 --> 01:06:36,850
Cause he's Coz it's good.
It's good.

1625
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:37,713
It's good.
You're really got to choose to be heal 

1626
01:06:38,761 --> 01:06:40,060
or hero.
And I would always go,

1627
01:06:40,061 --> 01:06:41,350
he'll,
he's all healed.

1628
01:06:41,410 --> 01:06:42,670
Ah,
it's so much more fun.

1629
01:06:42,671 --> 01:06:43,504
Go.
He'll,

1630
01:06:43,510 --> 01:06:44,343
you know what's really hilarious?
Chael Sonnen's mad that I talked about 

1631
01:06:46,870 --> 01:06:50,800
what he does that I know that I talked 
about with colby does.

1632
01:06:50,890 --> 01:06:52,210
I go,
he's having fun.

1633
01:06:52,270 --> 01:06:53,103
I go,
he's playing up the role of the villain 

1634
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:54,993
and he's selling papers cause you're 
cutting away the fourth wall to the 

1635
01:06:57,881 --> 01:07:00,040
business.
It's so ridiculous.

1636
01:07:00,070 --> 01:07:00,903
Meanwhile,
he's given up the secrets of the 

1637
01:07:01,391 --> 01:07:04,000
business by talking about me giving up 
the secrets of the business.

1638
01:07:04,540 --> 01:07:07,270
It's the dumbest shit of all time.
I can't tell if it's a work.

1639
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:10,450
I can't tell if what he's doing he's 
doing,

1640
01:07:10,570 --> 01:07:11,403
if he's fake upset.
There was a point where [inaudible] was 

1641
01:07:13,481 --> 01:07:16,120
the best trash talker in sports ever.
Yeah,

1642
01:07:16,330 --> 01:07:17,500
no,
he was phenomenal.

1643
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:21,100
He still is.
But the idea that you bring up the trash

1644
01:07:21,101 --> 01:07:23,890
on the doctor gone.
It's thunder.

1645
01:07:24,010 --> 01:07:24,843
When Anderson Silva walks in,
it sounds like a mouse pissing on 

1646
01:07:27,971 --> 01:07:28,804
cotton.

1647
01:07:32,380 --> 01:07:34,330
It's like,
what the fuck?

1648
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:37,210
I've never lost a fight in my lap.
I've never lost a route of,

1649
01:07:37,211 --> 01:07:40,810
I've never lost one second of one fight 
in my love life and that.

1650
01:07:40,811 --> 01:07:41,680
Then he's like,
what about here?

1651
01:07:41,681 --> 01:07:43,210
Where you're going to fucking stop.
Didn't matter.

1652
01:07:43,211 --> 01:07:44,500
He just kept going.
I loved it.

1653
01:07:44,501 --> 01:07:45,334
It was beautiful.
He's a smart guy but he's also getting 

1654
01:07:48,041 --> 01:07:50,200
us to talk about it and getting us to 
talk about his show,

1655
01:07:50,201 --> 01:07:51,880
which I'll give him a plug right now 
cause I'm sure it's great.

1656
01:07:51,881 --> 01:07:52,714
He's an Ariel Helwani and Chell son and 
have a new show called Ariel in the bad 

1657
01:07:57,161 --> 01:08:01,570
guy and you got to get that Espn Kay.
He's the bad guy.

1658
01:08:01,571 --> 01:08:02,404
He's great at it,
is great at us and he ranted and raved 

1659
01:08:04,691 --> 01:08:07,350
about us for like 10 minutes and then he
goes and then Brendan,

1660
01:08:07,351 --> 01:08:09,640
he responded and he came back with 
another 20 minutes.

1661
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:13,240
You don't ever talk about the business.
First of all have to,

1662
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:17,220
because my job is to what I see,
my job is not ness.

1663
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:18,890
I,
even when I'm promoting things,

1664
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:21,290
if I'm promoting things,
I'm calling what I see.

1665
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:26,180
If I say Francis and Ghana is the most 
terrifying heavyweight contender ever,

1666
01:08:26,570 --> 01:08:27,403
I say that because that's what I see.
I see him put Alistair overeem into 

1667
01:08:30,951 --> 01:08:31,784
fucking orbitz's side of it.
So you're just talking about the 

1668
01:08:33,231 --> 01:08:34,064
fighting part.
That's what you're experts that I talk 

1669
01:08:36,591 --> 01:08:37,610
about.
Whatever I want to talk about.

1670
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:38,590
Listen,
here's the deal.

1671
01:08:38,950 --> 01:08:39,783
Here's what you stick to.
Fighting a promoting and let 

1672
01:08:41,481 --> 01:08:42,550
intelligence,
uh,

1673
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:45,620
leave that here too intelligent people.
You're out of your class.

1674
01:08:45,710 --> 01:08:47,240
Fucking deal with it.
Whoa,

1675
01:08:47,430 --> 01:08:48,263
uneducated.
You're a high school dropout and you 

1676
01:08:49,281 --> 01:08:51,920
know it.
You go to trash talk and that's it.

1677
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:53,330
I don't think he's calling with your 
life.

1678
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:55,610
I think he graduated from college.
No,

1679
01:08:55,611 --> 01:08:56,444
he didn't.
He fucking dropped out of high school 

1680
01:08:57,590 --> 01:08:59,120
early,
like sophomore year.

1681
01:08:59,150 --> 01:09:00,470
No.
That guy's dumb,

1682
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:01,490
bro.
Yeah.

1683
01:09:01,590 --> 01:09:03,080
Son is gone.
Are you sure?

1684
01:09:03,110 --> 01:09:04,760
Yeah.
Have you ever talked to him?

1685
01:09:05,210 --> 01:09:06,043
Yes.
He Ain't told you two points above 

1686
01:09:07,311 --> 01:09:08,590
retarded.
Oh,

1687
01:09:10,370 --> 01:09:11,203
what are the points?
What points do you get when you got a 

1688
01:09:13,011 --> 01:09:16,160
real issue line that they have medically
is like,

1689
01:09:16,190 --> 01:09:19,340
if you are barely retarded,
you're still not fuck really retarded,

1690
01:09:19,341 --> 01:09:21,640
but I should be more politically correct
with our use of that word.

1691
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:25,610
Mentally retarded.
You're a terrible trans and trans.

1692
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:27,140
Start it all.
You can't say that.

1693
01:09:27,141 --> 01:09:29,140
You can't say that it's illegal.
It's like jazz.

1694
01:09:29,141 --> 01:09:31,130
It's hard.
It depending on who is president,

1695
01:09:31,131 --> 01:09:32,960
you'll get arrested for that to come in 
for you.

1696
01:09:33,830 --> 01:09:35,270
I like chill.
I like what he does.

1697
01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:38,450
I have to talk about the fact that 
someone's talking shit to build up,

1698
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:40,430
but it doesn't stop someone from talking
shit.

1699
01:09:40,670 --> 01:09:41,503
It also makes it more fun to watch.
I know what the fuck it is and I like 

1700
01:09:43,641 --> 01:09:45,080
it.
People are going to like it.

1701
01:09:45,260 --> 01:09:48,080
It makes it more interesting.
It makes it look Hofeld.

1702
01:09:48,081 --> 01:09:48,914
Dos Anjos went into that octagon with 
the weight of not just fighting colby 

1703
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:53,473
with his considerable skillset because 
Colby beat him from fucking what round 

1704
01:09:58,011 --> 01:09:58,844
one to round five.
Most rounds were controlled by colbys 

1705
01:10:01,401 --> 01:10:03,950
pressure.
Most moments dos Anjos,

1706
01:10:03,951 --> 01:10:04,784
he's a killer.
He had some very good moments in the 

1707
01:10:06,471 --> 01:10:08,240
first round,
but colby overwhelmed them.

1708
01:10:08,241 --> 01:10:11,330
There's no doubt about that.
So he has skill on top of that.

1709
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:12,433
But part of what was interesting about 
it was Hockfield dos Anjos came into 

1710
01:10:14,450 --> 01:10:16,940
there with the weight of all the shit 
that colby had been talking.

1711
01:10:17,140 --> 01:10:20,380
That stuff you carry that man all doe 
carrots.

1712
01:10:20,381 --> 01:10:23,780
What Aldo was with a led vest.
He's jumped in,

1713
01:10:23,781 --> 01:10:25,280
but do we need to do like a leg?

1714
01:10:25,340 --> 01:10:27,470
He had a led vest on of the anger he 
had.

1715
01:10:27,471 --> 01:10:28,304
He just wanted to smash conner and 
conner slid out of the way and just 

1716
01:10:31,611 --> 01:10:32,290
right away,
like,

1717
01:10:32,290 --> 01:10:34,520
what are you doing?
Drop the left hand on his chin.

1718
01:10:34,521 --> 01:10:35,354
It was,
it was one of the most artistic 

1719
01:10:36,470 --> 01:10:37,303
expressions of shit.
Talking manifest again outside the box 

1720
01:10:41,601 --> 01:10:42,730
behavior.
Uh,

1721
01:10:43,010 --> 01:10:45,800
you know,
a loss of composure.

1722
01:10:45,860 --> 01:10:47,900
He lost his composure.
He really did.

1723
01:10:47,930 --> 01:10:48,763
It was crazy for hyper aggressive and he
ran right into a perfectly place 

1724
01:10:52,380 --> 01:10:55,700
lefthand.
But Anderson and chill had that too.

1725
01:10:55,730 --> 01:10:56,500
I mean,
chill.

1726
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:58,380
Fuck.
He frustrated Anderson.

1727
01:10:58,381 --> 01:11:01,250
So frustrated more with what he was 
doing in the octagon.

1728
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:02,113
No saying saying first he talked crazy,
mad shit to peep for people to 

1729
01:11:06,831 --> 01:11:07,664
appreciate shale as a fighter.
What I say is you've seen some really 

1730
01:11:11,091 --> 01:11:14,220
good fights and his,
he's had some wins that are very good.

1731
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:16,380
He'd beat rampage.
That's a big win.

1732
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:17,513
But if you go back,
watch him fight nate Marquardt cause 

1733
01:11:19,861 --> 01:11:23,100
nate Marquardt was in his prime.
He would come over from strikeforce.

1734
01:11:23,250 --> 01:11:27,630
He was at that time when he had a busy 
just leaving strikeforce.

1735
01:11:27,780 --> 01:11:29,550
He went to strike force.
It became they're light.

1736
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:32,400
They're a welterweight champion.
It became the one 70 over there.

1737
01:11:32,550 --> 01:11:35,820
He peeked tyron woodley in this crazy 
fucking chaos sequence.

1738
01:11:35,970 --> 01:11:38,250
We blast with an elbow and hits him in 
the upper cut.

1739
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:40,290
It's one of the greatest Kaos sequences 
of all time.

1740
01:11:40,770 --> 01:11:42,660
I play this for you now let me,
let me just say this,

1741
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:46,080
nate Marquardt at one point in time was 
one of the best,

1742
01:11:46,081 --> 01:11:49,210
if not the best mixed martial arts 
fighter in this country has come give us

1743
01:11:49,220 --> 01:11:50,310
Anderson.
He never,

1744
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:52,190
no,
he never found the,

1745
01:11:52,191 --> 01:11:55,530
the UFC during his,
his right moments in his crime.

1746
01:11:55,890 --> 01:11:56,723
He had already had all shit load of 
fights outside the UFC by the time he 

1747
01:11:59,021 --> 01:11:59,854
got here.
And I think he was probably a little 

1748
01:12:01,051 --> 01:12:03,080
compromised by the time he got here.
Josh Barnett.

1749
01:12:03,090 --> 01:12:04,440
It's like the,
yeah,

1750
01:12:05,940 --> 01:12:09,940
he won the title in the UFC when he was 
talking to 44.

1751
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:11,850
He's the youngest ever UFC heavyweight 
champion.

1752
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:12,870
I'm a moron.
I mean,

1753
01:12:12,871 --> 01:12:16,290
that's clearly where Josh fought a bunch
at times VFC during one stint.

1754
01:12:16,710 --> 01:12:17,543
Um,
and he,

1755
01:12:17,580 --> 01:12:19,380
he got killed by Pedro.
His,

1756
01:12:19,381 --> 01:12:22,290
oh,
he beat randy couture for the title.

1757
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:24,030
Josh was a beast,
man.

1758
01:12:24,860 --> 01:12:26,630
I mean,
Josh was a fucking beast.

1759
01:12:26,990 --> 01:12:28,490
He really was.
Um,

1760
01:12:28,550 --> 01:12:29,383
but so it was nate Marquardt and shale 
fought nate Marquardt when nate 

1761
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:36,260
Marquardt was very close to his prime,
they went to war,

1762
01:12:36,261 --> 01:12:38,830
man.
They went to fucking war and chilled.

1763
01:12:38,831 --> 01:12:40,520
Nominated them until dominated them.
Yeah.

1764
01:12:40,521 --> 01:12:44,300
And we dominated with his wrestling is 
wrestling because he talks so much shit.

1765
01:12:44,430 --> 01:12:46,010
And because he seemed so silly when he 
says,

1766
01:12:46,011 --> 01:12:48,950
I've never lost us.
Second of are any around in any fight.

1767
01:12:49,370 --> 01:12:50,203
This is,
this is the Kaos secrets with Nick 

1768
01:12:51,910 --> 01:12:52,760
Marquardt and Tyron.
Dude,

1769
01:12:52,761 --> 01:12:56,330
nate Marquardt was a fucking assassin at
one point.

1770
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:58,220
Yeah.
Guys,

1771
01:12:58,250 --> 01:12:59,630
I know guys that trained within,
they say,

1772
01:12:59,631 --> 01:13:01,670
dude,
I never saw nate lose a fucking round.

1773
01:13:02,090 --> 01:13:04,580
He just,
it just never came together perfectly in

1774
01:13:04,581 --> 01:13:06,140
the UFC,
but watch this chaos sequence.

1775
01:13:06,141 --> 01:13:07,220
This is insane.
By the way,

1776
01:13:07,221 --> 01:13:07,990
he's fighting

1777
01:13:07,990 --> 01:13:08,890
Woodley.
Boom.

1778
01:13:08,891 --> 01:13:09,730
He catches him.
Watch this,

1779
01:13:10,150 --> 01:13:11,590
watch this elbow.
Boom.

1780
01:13:12,220 --> 01:13:14,660
Here comes,
oh,

1781
01:13:14,710 --> 01:13:17,260
this is not the sequence.
This is the sequence towards the end.

1782
01:13:20,770 --> 01:13:21,603
Yeah.
This is not the sequence where it was 

1783
01:13:22,570 --> 01:13:23,403
the Kao CV.
Just get right to the Kao thought I had 

1784
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:29,710
it right.
Then it started over.

1785
01:13:30,580 --> 01:13:32,710
This was a,
by the way,

1786
01:13:32,711 --> 01:13:34,630
very different.
Tyron Woodley I should say too.

1787
01:13:34,631 --> 01:13:37,150
This is pre duke roufus.
This is tyron.

1788
01:13:37,151 --> 01:13:38,770
When he was just coming off of 
wrestling.

1789
01:13:38,771 --> 01:13:39,604
Here it is.
So you heard him with that right hand 

1790
01:13:41,770 --> 01:13:44,470
and he comes in and he catches them with
a,

1791
01:13:44,950 --> 01:13:48,130
with a big elbow.
This been way better.

1792
01:13:48,131 --> 01:13:51,550
If it was just cued up to the chaos,
isn't there just the chaos sequence?

1793
01:13:52,670 --> 01:13:54,680
Because I know I've seen it like just as
a,

1794
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:57,250
a clip on youtube.
Just scoot ahead a little.

1795
01:13:57,730 --> 01:13:58,563
Yeah,
right there.

1796
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:00,890
Yeah.
Named mark was great for a while.

1797
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:01,760
Dude.
I'm telling you.

1798
01:14:01,761 --> 01:14:02,810
So this fight,
boom,

1799
01:14:02,811 --> 01:14:04,220
look at this.
Boom,

1800
01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:06,390
boom.
Come on man.

1801
01:14:06,391 --> 01:14:07,910
That's video game.
Play that back.

1802
01:14:07,940 --> 01:14:09,890
Gosh,
that's video game shit.

1803
01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:12,370
That's video game shit.
Every one.

1804
01:14:12,530 --> 01:14:14,740
And again,
this is tyron Woodley.

1805
01:14:14,741 --> 01:14:19,090
He's a fucking stud.
Hello all the way down.

1806
01:14:19,150 --> 01:14:21,820
That shit is insane.
That's an insane Kao.

1807
01:14:22,180 --> 01:14:26,890
So chail dominated that dude and 
dominated him when he was in this era.

1808
01:14:27,010 --> 01:14:27,843
Tell me,
what year was this fight and what year 

1809
01:14:29,471 --> 01:14:31,180
was [inaudible] fight against them in 
the UFC?

1810
01:14:31,570 --> 01:14:35,860
So chill has some serious skill too,
particularly with his wrestling.

1811
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:37,420
So people,
you know,

1812
01:14:37,460 --> 01:14:39,120
they,
he,

1813
01:14:39,130 --> 01:14:42,460
but the trash talking was why he became 
famous.

1814
01:14:42,490 --> 01:14:45,150
It wasn't just that,
it was,

1815
01:14:45,340 --> 01:14:46,450
no,
it was a trash talker.

1816
01:14:46,451 --> 01:14:48,750
That's when I became aware of Google,
nate Marquardt.

1817
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:50,080
Um,
uh,

1818
01:14:50,230 --> 01:14:51,220
his lead,
I mean,

1819
01:14:52,260 --> 01:14:54,250
was,
was like nothing I'd ever seen.

1820
01:14:54,630 --> 01:14:58,150
Anderson,
I thought you absolutely suck.

1821
01:14:58,790 --> 01:15:01,660
I mean,
we saw a bunch of Anderson fights and we

1822
01:15:01,661 --> 01:15:03,730
saw a bunch of pipe before that,
but it was never,

1823
01:15:04,020 --> 01:15:05,800
it was never that.
The bathroom was like,

1824
01:15:05,830 --> 01:15:06,663
I'm going to take him down and beat him.
So the Tyron Woodley fight was in 2012 

1825
01:15:11,380 --> 01:15:14,170
and when did he fight?
Chael Sonnen was before that.

1826
01:15:14,171 --> 01:15:18,640
See that's how good chell son and was he
beat that two years before,

1827
01:15:18,730 --> 01:15:22,450
before he went over to strike force,
it became the welterweight champion.

1828
01:15:22,660 --> 01:15:23,493
So you,
he fought him in his absolute prime and 

1829
01:15:26,081 --> 01:15:27,940
dominated them.
He could people,

1830
01:15:27,941 --> 01:15:29,860
this is,
this is nate Marquardt duty fought.

1831
01:15:29,861 --> 01:15:32,550
Everybody lists her Silva.
Jeremy Horn.

1832
01:15:32,570 --> 01:15:34,960
Now Damien Maia.
Which one punch?

1833
01:15:34,990 --> 01:15:38,440
Remembering in Maya Chael Sonnen.
He got lit up by Anderson though.

1834
01:15:38,620 --> 01:15:40,020
Cardo Meda.
Fuck this.

1835
01:15:40,090 --> 01:15:42,760
Who Shall Cami Anderson ground and 
pounded him,

1836
01:15:42,761 --> 01:15:44,500
I think nate.
Nate,

1837
01:15:44,950 --> 01:15:45,783
nate.
Honestly I feel like nate at one 70 was 

1838
01:15:48,341 --> 01:15:49,150
that as best?

1839
01:15:49,150 --> 01:15:50,350
Yeah,
you t k o to me grounded.

1840
01:15:50,351 --> 01:15:51,184
Pounded him,
I believe at one seven he was at his 

1841
01:15:53,561 --> 01:15:56,800
best like can you see him at the time?
Would they fight because he was big,

1842
01:15:57,040 --> 01:16:00,590
but he wasn't too big.
He wasn't too bulky and he was a,

1843
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:02,680
he was a very powerful guy for that 
weight class.

1844
01:16:02,681 --> 01:16:04,360
If you could kept it that way.
Class.

1845
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:05,680
Damn.
He's lost a lot.

1846
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:07,410
He lost a lot of fights.
Yeah,

1847
01:16:07,870 --> 01:16:10,000
that's the problem.
And I think he's retiring now,

1848
01:16:10,330 --> 01:16:12,640
but um,
he's like two and six foot.

1849
01:16:12,670 --> 01:16:13,503
My point was it doesn't take anything 
away from the skill of the guy when 

1850
01:16:16,091 --> 01:16:18,160
you're talking about his shit talking.
It's fun.

1851
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:19,173
It's a fun aspect of what it is that you
have to talk about and the activities 

1852
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:24,700
not making money off.
It is preposterous.

1853
01:16:24,730 --> 01:16:27,220
That's a ridiculous argument.
He was saying that,

1854
01:16:27,221 --> 01:16:28,054
I said that he was,
that he was doing it for pay per view 

1855
01:16:29,501 --> 01:16:30,334
sales and he's like,
he doesn't get a penny of those paper 

1856
01:16:31,391 --> 01:16:33,430
view sales,
but that's a ridiculous thing.

1857
01:16:33,430 --> 01:16:34,270
First of all,
what I'm saying,

1858
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:36,010
he's a dumb guy.
Oh,

1859
01:16:36,060 --> 01:16:39,280
his trash talk is just from a Ba from 
from an uninformed point of view.

1860
01:16:39,281 --> 01:16:42,550
It's great because it's like stupid 
stupidly like into something.

1861
01:16:42,580 --> 01:16:45,430
But like he's not educated on almost any
subject other than fighter.

1862
01:16:46,270 --> 01:16:47,470
I think he's a smart guy.
No,

1863
01:16:47,471 --> 01:16:48,490
I disagree.
I talked to him.

1864
01:16:48,491 --> 01:16:49,820
I feel like he's very intelligent.
Yeah.

1865
01:16:49,970 --> 01:16:50,803
Wow.
You're a giving.

1866
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:55,480
Wow.
I am a Guinea harsh toward them.

1867
01:16:55,481 --> 01:16:57,310
My face,
when I look at all the Jews that one,

1868
01:16:57,311 --> 01:17:00,610
Nobel peace prizes,
Nobel Science Project,

1869
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:03,730
whatever it is.
What is the Nobel Prize for science?

1870
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:08,770
One by more European Jews than I think 
any other race.

1871
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:10,010
Is it surprising?

1872
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:11,001
Isn't that true?
Yeah,

1873
01:17:11,001 --> 01:17:12,000
that sounds right.
Something,

1874
01:17:12,050 --> 01:17:13,400
any other race,
any other,

1875
01:17:13,401 --> 01:17:16,040
I think any other like obvious 
classification.

1876
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:19,460
It's never a Sicilian Italians.
You know the word's out,

1877
01:17:19,461 --> 01:17:19,970
man.
We,

1878
01:17:19,970 --> 01:17:20,930
yeah,
we're smart.

1879
01:17:21,110 --> 01:17:23,180
Why are you guys smarter?
What is that about?

1880
01:17:23,270 --> 01:17:27,380
I think it's just honestly like just 
stuff jimmy the Greek was talking about,

1881
01:17:27,381 --> 01:17:30,530
but like in a positive way.
Just we're just our brains.

1882
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:31,460
We're just,
we've inner,

1883
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:32,181
first of all,
okay.

1884
01:17:32,181 --> 01:17:35,660
Were bred for that.
We don't have any outside genes.

1885
01:17:35,710 --> 01:17:36,740
Right.
So like,

1886
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:41,350
you know how some dogs are super like 
loyal bread.

1887
01:17:41,540 --> 01:17:42,860
Yeah.
Or we're just intelligence.

1888
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:47,240
Everything else was falling apart.
It might be something to that.

1889
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:49,720
Why is it racist to say,
why is it racist?

1890
01:17:49,770 --> 01:17:50,603
I used to say we're smarter.
It's crazy to say something is less 

1891
01:17:52,701 --> 01:17:53,890
smart.
Less.

1892
01:17:53,910 --> 01:17:54,860
Yeah,
but no,

1893
01:17:54,861 --> 01:17:57,710
we're the smartest ones.
Maybe second,

1894
01:17:58,730 --> 01:18:00,720
maybe the Chinese guy you beat,
well,

1895
01:18:00,740 --> 01:18:01,573
you know Asians.

1896
01:18:01,670 --> 01:18:02,980
This is what's really crazy.
Yeah.

1897
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:07,070
There's a real issue right now with 
Asians and university enrollments,

1898
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:10,660
particularly in Harvard.
They discriminate against Asians because

1899
01:18:10,661 --> 01:18:13,040
so many apply because so many are 
kicking ass.

1900
01:18:13,620 --> 01:18:15,970
Yeah.
To get them out of there.

1901
01:18:16,210 --> 01:18:17,000
Yeah.
There's,

1902
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:22,000
there's like real talk about how this is
crazy because Asian people for bye,

1903
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:24,353
right?
This is a generalization and try not to 

1904
01:18:25,761 --> 01:18:28,310
be racist,
but generally speaking,

1905
01:18:28,970 --> 01:18:29,803
Asian students are known as working very
hard and they're very dedicated and 

1906
01:18:34,731 --> 01:18:35,564
they're very successful and the 
representation is overwhelming in terms 

1907
01:18:39,111 --> 01:18:41,990
of their numbers in the population and 
they're killing it,

1908
01:18:42,260 --> 01:18:45,790
killing it,
and because of that and their,

1909
01:18:45,791 --> 01:18:48,200
their mindset is to just work really 
hard.

1910
01:18:48,590 --> 01:18:52,100
It's not to protest things and not to 
shut things down.

1911
01:18:52,101 --> 01:18:54,290
It's just creating the library.
They're all those protests.

1912
01:18:54,291 --> 01:18:56,090
There was in the library,
some of the Indians.

1913
01:18:56,091 --> 01:18:57,380
While this is all happening.

1914
01:18:57,740 --> 01:18:59,360
I'm not saying that they're not socially
conscious,

1915
01:18:59,361 --> 01:19:02,990
but while this is all happening,
they're not protesting it the way may be

1916
01:19:03,230 --> 01:19:04,063
other groups that felt marginalized,
whether it's people of color or trans 

1917
01:19:07,611 --> 01:19:08,930
people or gay people,
whatever it is,

1918
01:19:08,980 --> 01:19:11,330
don't feel represented or discriminated 
against.

1919
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:14,300
They would be shutting down,
you know,

1920
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:18,890
conferences and yelling down speakers 
and shouting out in the hallway.

1921
01:19:18,980 --> 01:19:22,260
But the Asians,
the whole reason why they kick ass cause

1922
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:24,350
cause they don't spend any time on petty
bullshit.

1923
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:26,240
He's like get done.
So because of that,

1924
01:19:26,390 --> 01:19:29,030
the Harvard,
Harvard fucking Harvard is saying,

1925
01:19:29,031 --> 01:19:29,864
Hey,
we're going to be racist against you 

1926
01:19:30,651 --> 01:19:31,880
cause we know you're not going to 
complain.

1927
01:19:31,910 --> 01:19:32,990
Well wow.
What?

1928
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:34,790
Look at this.
Let's pull this up.

1929
01:19:34,791 --> 01:19:35,624
Pull this up Jamie.
I want you to pull up Asian students 

1930
01:19:39,050 --> 01:19:43,490
harder to get into Harvard lawsuit.
That's crazy.

1931
01:19:43,670 --> 01:19:46,040
It's crazy.
And it's not a small amount.

1932
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:49,130
They're discriminating by,
they're making their grades considerably

1933
01:19:49,131 --> 01:19:51,590
higher in order to gain acceptance.
Really?

1934
01:19:51,591 --> 01:19:52,630
Yes.
Wow.

1935
01:19:52,660 --> 01:19:53,493
Yeah.
I mean it's all because of a natural 

1936
01:19:54,111 --> 01:19:56,190
breakdown of different races.
You can't,

1937
01:19:56,630 --> 01:19:57,463
you can't slow one down.
Harvard would have less less productive 

1938
01:20:01,671 --> 01:20:03,290
graduates.
It doesn't make any sense.

1939
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:06,500
It's a crazy way of thinking,
but it's all in this idea of diversity,

1940
01:20:06,590 --> 01:20:09,630
like instead treating people as 
individuals instead of just saying human

1941
01:20:09,631 --> 01:20:10,464
beings.
You have to have each class represented 

1942
01:20:12,871 --> 01:20:17,110
by a certain amount of people,
but it's not anti [inaudible].

1943
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:22,080
It's like it's not a racist idea to want
everybody to be treated as one.

1944
01:20:22,650 --> 01:20:23,483
It's just,
it can be done with an eye on avoiding 

1945
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:29,820
all possible racism.
It can be done to treat people purely as

1946
01:20:29,821 --> 01:20:30,654
individuals.
Here's the worst way that can ever be 

1947
01:20:32,191 --> 01:20:34,380
done.
The worst way because you tell them most

1948
01:20:34,381 --> 01:20:37,800
successful people were complaining the 
least that they have to work harder.

1949
01:20:37,950 --> 01:20:38,783
You are getting fucked by your genes.
You the people in your past and your 

1950
01:20:42,511 --> 01:20:43,344
group,
your little gene pool to good doing too 

1951
01:20:45,601 --> 01:20:48,540
good in schools so we don't make it 
harder than it is from my kids.

1952
01:20:49,020 --> 01:20:49,853
That's nuts.
Literally what people are doing there 

1953
01:20:51,581 --> 01:20:53,000
too,
because if they didn't harp,

1954
01:20:53,001 --> 01:20:55,050
it wouldn't be like all Asians,
Asians,

1955
01:20:55,051 --> 01:20:55,884
it'd be dominating and it the very 
reason why they think they can get away 

1956
01:20:59,101 --> 01:20:59,934
with this lawsuit accuses Harvard have 
discriminated against Asian American 

1957
01:21:02,191 --> 01:21:05,070
applicants in personal ratings,
personal writings.

1958
01:21:05,850 --> 01:21:06,720
I don't know what it is,
man.

1959
01:21:07,710 --> 01:21:11,550
They're making it more difficult.
It says students for fair admissions has

1960
01:21:11,551 --> 01:21:12,384
accused Harvard of intentionally 
discriminating against Asian American 

1961
01:21:14,851 --> 01:21:19,080
applicants by limiting their admissions 
numbers so they're limiting the numbers.

1962
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:21,033
I this many agents and by the way,
that's super hard for like let's say 

1963
01:21:24,631 --> 01:21:27,460
like Vietnamese or not the Chinese or 
Japanese Craig,

1964
01:21:27,510 --> 01:21:29,910
you know we should say we don't know if 
this is true.

1965
01:21:29,940 --> 01:21:30,950
We should say,
you know,

1966
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:33,000
just to be really clear,
this is a lawsuit.

1967
01:21:33,001 --> 01:21:36,150
We don't know if this is true,
but this is the argument and this is the

1968
01:21:36,151 --> 01:21:36,961
argument that many,
many,

1969
01:21:36,961 --> 01:21:38,850
many people have made.
Now,

1970
01:21:38,851 --> 01:21:40,740
I haven't really personally researched 
this,

1971
01:21:40,741 --> 01:21:42,930
but I know a lot of like legitimate 
intellectuals,

1972
01:21:42,931 --> 01:21:45,210
it brought this up and debates and 
conversations and they're saying,

1973
01:21:45,211 --> 01:21:46,500
look,
this is an issue.

1974
01:21:47,070 --> 01:21:47,903
This is essentially,
this is sanctioned racism against one 

1975
01:21:51,721 --> 01:21:52,554
group because they're too effective.
So you're limiting the number of your 

1976
01:21:54,631 --> 01:21:58,350
sag web where we're trying to get more 
of an emphasis on like extra curriculars

1977
01:21:59,010 --> 01:22:03,420
in or out based on being Asian or based 
on being European.

1978
01:22:03,421 --> 01:22:04,254
That's crazy.
You should get in or out by you having 

1979
01:22:06,991 --> 01:22:07,824
merit and you being a a worthy student 
and difficult schools like Harvard or 

1980
01:22:11,881 --> 01:22:14,940
supposed to be difficult and if the 
cream of the crop all comes from Asia,

1981
01:22:15,510 --> 01:22:16,343
shouldn't we look at what the fuck we're
doing here that we can't compete with 

1982
01:22:19,081 --> 01:22:19,260
them?

1983
01:22:19,260 --> 01:22:20,093
I mean,
what is it?

1984
01:22:20,970 --> 01:22:23,310
Wow there.
Do we want Asian students?

1985
01:22:23,340 --> 01:22:24,750
Do we want to compete with them?
I mean,

1986
01:22:24,751 --> 01:22:27,840
is it too much or they were requiring 
too much of their life to be successful.

1987
01:22:27,841 --> 01:22:28,350
What?
Their style,

1988
01:22:28,350 --> 01:22:29,790
their schoolwork.
I mean,

1989
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:31,050
yeah.
That's the thing too.

1990
01:22:31,051 --> 01:22:31,884
If you're going to want a normal life,
you want to look up your normal life 

1991
01:22:34,171 --> 01:22:35,004
too.
If you're going through college and 

1992
01:22:36,780 --> 01:22:40,290
everything you're doing all day is 
studying and you literally,

1993
01:22:40,291 --> 01:22:41,124
you might have like some fucking shitty 
part job somewhere to make some money 

1994
01:22:44,190 --> 01:22:46,140
for food and then you're studying more,
right?

1995
01:22:46,141 --> 01:22:47,850
Maybe you have a part time job.
A lot of people don't.

1996
01:22:48,270 --> 01:22:51,450
So if you think about all that topic,
if I want for my kids,

1997
01:22:51,580 --> 01:22:53,450
that's a crazy life.
No way you,

1998
01:22:53,470 --> 01:22:56,400
and especially with some of the things 
are just for four years.

1999
01:22:56,430 --> 01:22:57,263
Some of the things,
it's not that anything you're really 

2000
01:22:58,381 --> 01:23:00,210
interested in,
but you have to get it on.

2001
01:23:00,750 --> 01:23:01,680
You have to be,
you know,

2002
01:23:01,681 --> 01:23:03,900
you have to have a fully balanced 
education,

2003
01:23:03,901 --> 01:23:06,280
so you have to take classes you're not 
even remotely interested in.

2004
01:23:07,100 --> 01:23:09,760
You have to do it.
And it's this one way and this is how we

2005
01:23:09,761 --> 01:23:10,594
can assure that you have enough 
knowledge that we can give you a piece 

2006
01:23:12,551 --> 01:23:17,551
of paper that says you have a degree.
I mean an Asians or Kkr as well.

2007
01:23:19,020 --> 01:23:19,853
That's the game.
Okay.

2008
01:23:19,980 --> 01:23:21,070
Okay.
Within those roles.

2009
01:23:21,100 --> 01:23:21,933
Well,
we'll just going to work 20 hours a 

2010
01:23:22,730 --> 01:23:23,260
dude,
I,

2011
01:23:23,260 --> 01:23:24,790
my friend,
junk sick.

2012
01:23:25,080 --> 01:23:26,590
I've think I've told you about him 
before.

2013
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:30,400
He was a u s national taekwondo team 
member when I was like,

2014
01:23:31,300 --> 01:23:33,310
hmm,
what is this junk sec,

2015
01:23:33,530 --> 01:23:34,960
Indonesia Chang.
He's Korean.

2016
01:23:35,860 --> 01:23:38,500
He was going through his fucking 
residency.

2017
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:39,513
He was going to be a doctor going 
through his residency and training for 

2018
01:23:41,801 --> 01:23:44,440
the national team and he was running 
stairs,

2019
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:47,320
running stairs in the school in between 
studying,

2020
01:23:47,650 --> 01:23:49,360
he would do studying the nude run the 
stairs.

2021
01:23:49,390 --> 01:23:51,010
You got to hold the guy got back,
dude.

2022
01:23:51,011 --> 01:23:53,170
You couldn't hold him back.
He slept four hours a night.

2023
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:54,440
That if that's true,
that's,

2024
01:23:54,441 --> 01:23:56,710
that's the same shit is like he was 
always tired.

2025
01:23:56,830 --> 01:23:58,690
Yeah.
He's always tired because he works hard.

2026
01:23:59,290 --> 01:24:01,360
He wouldn't give a fuck.
He was always tired.

2027
01:24:01,361 --> 01:24:03,700
He would just show up exhausted and kick
ass.

2028
01:24:03,730 --> 01:24:04,563
Wow.
And he wasn't physically talented 

2029
01:24:05,501 --> 01:24:07,180
either.
This guy made it to the,

2030
01:24:07,210 --> 01:24:08,043
to the nationals and he became a 
national champion and he wasn't even 

2031
01:24:10,781 --> 01:24:12,670
like really,
really physically talented.

2032
01:24:12,940 --> 01:24:15,850
It wasn't like some freak athlete that 
just move super fast.

2033
01:24:15,851 --> 01:24:18,490
You can,
he's just fucking unbelievably smart,

2034
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:22,840
unbelievably hard worker.
But I saw the way that guy was living as

2035
01:24:23,110 --> 01:24:23,943
he was like I was a couple of years 
younger than him and he was going 

2036
01:24:25,991 --> 01:24:26,824
through his residency and training and 
doing all this crazy shit at the same 

2037
01:24:29,021 --> 01:24:30,670
time and I was,
I was like,

2038
01:24:30,730 --> 01:24:32,410
I'm exhausted just watching you.

2039
01:24:32,530 --> 01:24:35,860
Like I can't see how this could be worth
it to do all those things.

2040
01:24:35,861 --> 01:24:38,080
Did you one of those things?
Maybe that's what I want to do.

2041
01:24:38,081 --> 01:24:40,550
I want to do one of those things,
but you're doing two of those things.

2042
01:24:41,180 --> 01:24:45,220
He was doing what I was doing and then 
on top of it and more and way more,

2043
01:24:45,250 --> 01:24:46,083
way more,
he was doing schoolwork done was 

2044
01:24:48,070 --> 01:24:51,730
delivering newspapers and shit.
If that's happening,

2045
01:24:51,790 --> 01:24:54,250
they're just saying like,
it's the same thing as like making it so

2046
01:24:54,251 --> 01:24:56,050
white people get ahead.
It's crazy.

2047
01:24:56,170 --> 01:24:57,003
It's like you could as loitering laws,
now you're arrested if you don't have a 

2048
01:24:59,321 --> 01:25:00,250
job,
but that's,

2049
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:02,590
this is where you could realize that all
this stuff is crazy.

2050
01:25:02,860 --> 01:25:03,580
You're,
you're,

2051
01:25:03,580 --> 01:25:04,413
you're being racist against a minority 
and you think it's okay because they 

2052
01:25:08,051 --> 01:25:10,680
kicked so much ass because there are 
powerful.

2053
01:25:10,700 --> 01:25:11,500
So were like,
we can,

2054
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:12,490
we can take them down south.

2055
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:13,353
It's literally racist because if you're 
saying you can only have a certain 

2056
01:25:15,731 --> 01:25:18,400
number of these people in there,
it's crazy.

2057
01:25:18,401 --> 01:25:21,090
That's racist.
It's gotta be to,

2058
01:25:21,100 --> 01:25:21,701
to,
to say,

2059
01:25:21,701 --> 01:25:22,534
no,
we're trying to keep a diverse 

2060
01:25:23,651 --> 01:25:26,680
population so you're not a 
representative population of the best of

2061
01:25:26,681 --> 01:25:28,570
the best then.
I mean,

2062
01:25:28,571 --> 01:25:29,404
they should take off any of their names 
off of their applications or something 

2063
01:25:31,961 --> 01:25:33,540
like that and just were like,
let's see what they got.

2064
01:25:34,060 --> 01:25:34,893
Yeah.
But I guess they'd probably judge you 

2065
01:25:36,341 --> 01:25:37,540
based on many things.
Right.

2066
01:25:37,570 --> 01:25:38,403
You know,
they try that for the old daily show 

2067
01:25:39,221 --> 01:25:41,650
with Jon Stewart.
Just take the names off the application.

2068
01:25:41,651 --> 01:25:43,840
We don't want to see your names just for
your writing sample.

2069
01:25:44,020 --> 01:25:45,130
Oh,
that's smart.

2070
01:25:45,210 --> 01:25:46,150
Yeah.
That's smart.

2071
01:25:46,180 --> 01:25:47,260
Well,
here's what happened though.

2072
01:25:48,490 --> 01:25:51,220
The hired only white males,
goddammit.

2073
01:25:51,580 --> 01:25:53,680
Yeah.
And the John Stewart was like,

2074
01:25:53,710 --> 01:25:54,543
okay,
I guess we're going in blind is not 

2075
01:25:56,681 --> 01:25:58,360
enough.
I guess we fucked up.

2076
01:25:59,230 --> 01:26:01,420
He didn't even say like,
well that just shows it's not our fault.

2077
01:26:01,421 --> 01:26:03,980
That's just fucking randomly we had 
eight people and they happen to be white

2078
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:05,240
dudes.
Here's the thing though,

2079
01:26:05,420 --> 01:26:08,540
if you had movers,
okay,

2080
01:26:08,541 --> 01:26:12,200
and you wanted to move furniture and you
tested people for moving furniture,

2081
01:26:12,201 --> 01:26:14,940
is it okay to hire all men?
Yeah,

2082
01:26:15,020 --> 01:26:15,853
it's okay.
Why?

2083
01:26:15,890 --> 01:26:18,980
Because they're physically stronger 
physically right now.

2084
01:26:19,940 --> 01:26:24,560
Um,
is it okay to hire someone who you think

2085
01:26:24,561 --> 01:26:25,394
is going to be the best at the job or do
you have to have a certain amount of 

2086
01:26:28,341 --> 01:26:31,280
women so you wouldn't expect it from 
something physical,

2087
01:26:31,580 --> 01:26:32,413
like a moving company,
but why should it be mandatory for 

2088
01:26:33,891 --> 01:26:35,390
something like a creative thing?
Well,

2089
01:26:35,391 --> 01:26:36,224
it's different a little bit because no 
one except the client is appreciating 

2090
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:40,860
the movers,
right?

2091
01:26:40,910 --> 01:26:41,743
It's just like if I'm hiring,
I'm the only one who have to deal with 

2092
01:26:44,121 --> 01:26:45,580
it.
Like safe.

2093
01:26:45,590 --> 01:26:46,850
You were saved,
you were,

2094
01:26:46,851 --> 01:26:50,090
um,
doing a show like a woman's show,

2095
01:26:50,091 --> 01:26:51,530
a woman's comedy show.
Okay.

2096
01:26:51,650 --> 01:26:55,340
And what am I,
am I may know or am I a woman?

2097
01:26:55,790 --> 01:26:56,810
You'd have to be a woman,
I guess.

2098
01:26:56,840 --> 01:26:58,820
Okay,
go ahead and you want,

2099
01:26:58,821 --> 01:26:59,654
you are a female executive producer and 
you want to have like a female voice to 

2100
01:27:02,241 --> 01:27:03,074
it.
So you wanted to is hire some really 

2101
01:27:03,831 --> 01:27:07,310
funny chicks and what guy's gonna?
I know,

2102
01:27:07,311 --> 01:27:09,080
obviously it happens way,
way,

2103
01:27:09,081 --> 01:27:09,914
way,
way more often the opposite way where 

2104
01:27:11,391 --> 01:27:14,300
women get discriminated against but what
guy is going to say no,

2105
01:27:14,301 --> 01:27:16,310
fuck that.
I want a part of this.

2106
01:27:16,680 --> 01:27:17,250
Oh right.
You know,

2107
01:27:17,250 --> 01:27:19,580
I should have a job here.
You should call a troll.

2108
01:27:19,630 --> 01:27:24,080
Troll won't be equally represented male 
versus female cause that's what a lot of

2109
01:27:24,081 --> 01:27:25,580
people feel like when it comes to men 
and women.

2110
01:27:25,610 --> 01:27:26,443
Like someone was telling bird on his 
podcast that the comedy store should be 

2111
01:27:29,180 --> 01:27:30,770
half a minute.
I know that lady just,

2112
01:27:31,350 --> 01:27:34,850
she has no idea what American comedy is 
all about.

2113
01:27:35,980 --> 01:27:37,160
La.
Yeah.

2114
01:27:37,160 --> 01:27:38,840
Yeah.
She's speaking in an uninformed way.

2115
01:27:39,050 --> 01:27:41,450
The white shell does a lot.
I mean it's ridiculous,

2116
01:27:41,540 --> 01:27:42,500
dude.
It's not a joke.

2117
01:27:42,501 --> 01:27:45,080
He's just not that smart.
You all get tell that whatever.

2118
01:27:45,230 --> 01:27:48,140
But this one was the same as jail where 
she was like uninformed.

2119
01:27:48,141 --> 01:27:51,830
They just going full bore and she wasn't
doing to promote anything.

2120
01:27:51,831 --> 01:27:53,480
She was just doing it because she 
thought it was right,

2121
01:27:53,481 --> 01:27:53,871
but it's like,
oh,

2122
01:27:53,871 --> 01:27:55,670
you don't really understand how this 
works.

2123
01:27:57,260 --> 01:27:58,093
There's a process or it's like,
I saw a blog once said we need more 

2124
01:28:00,291 --> 01:28:02,420
women in,
in like hiring positions.

2125
01:28:02,421 --> 01:28:03,050
And it's like,
oh,

2126
01:28:03,050 --> 01:28:06,080
you mean the head of the comedy store?
The head of the fucking comedy cellar,

2127
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:08,070
head of New York comedy club.
Uh,

2128
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:10,430
uh,
Kobe are like,

2129
01:28:10,431 --> 01:28:12,920
there's plenty of female bookers like 
you don't really know,

2130
01:28:12,921 --> 01:28:14,040
so I'm going to tell them that.
Then it,

2131
01:28:14,090 --> 01:28:14,691
then she go,
oh,

2132
01:28:14,691 --> 01:28:15,200
okay.

2133
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:16,040
Oh,
I didn't realize that.

2134
01:28:16,550 --> 01:28:17,383
Well,
there's certain things that people love 

2135
01:28:17,901 --> 01:28:21,710
to say when they've done almost no 
research on what it actually is.

2136
01:28:22,110 --> 01:28:24,170
Yeah.
One lady had no clue.

2137
01:28:24,171 --> 01:28:26,330
She just goes,
I'm not getting in here.

2138
01:28:26,331 --> 01:28:28,070
I'm a big comic.
I'm not getting in here.

2139
01:28:28,100 --> 01:28:30,750
It must be,
it's just not causation and causality.

2140
01:28:30,751 --> 01:28:32,000
She goes,
it must be because of this.

2141
01:28:32,060 --> 01:28:33,300
I've had my agents calling.
It's like,

2142
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:34,550
oh no.
I worked for Mitzi.

2143
01:28:34,730 --> 01:28:37,020
When agents or managers call sound like 
my client in,

2144
01:28:37,021 --> 01:28:39,050
she'd go fuck off.
That's something that we do things here,

2145
01:28:39,110 --> 01:28:39,943
dude.
I got in an argument with someone about 

2146
01:28:40,791 --> 01:28:41,624
the wage gap and they really believed 
that men and women work right next to 

2147
01:28:45,411 --> 01:28:46,244
each other doing the same job and the 
woman is only making 75 cents to the 

2148
01:28:48,291 --> 01:28:50,520
guys dollar I'm going to put out there 
in no time.

2149
01:28:50,530 --> 01:28:51,363
This is a crazy thing to argue.
Like if you're going to argue that you 

2150
01:28:54,740 --> 01:28:56,750
should know what that is,
you should know what that is.

2151
01:28:56,810 --> 01:28:59,960
Otherwise you just talking shit and 
which we all do sometimes.

2152
01:29:00,110 --> 01:29:01,830
But you gotta be willing to say as 
climate change,

2153
01:29:02,190 --> 01:29:03,170
I believe that that's,
I believe in that.

2154
01:29:03,171 --> 01:29:07,380
It's like which studies have you read?
And it's almost always no zero studies.

2155
01:29:08,100 --> 01:29:10,050
I like to believe this or versus 
whatever.

2156
01:29:10,110 --> 01:29:11,610
Luckily we're not in charge of making 
decisions.

2157
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:15,240
People Love,
love to put these studies out.

2158
01:29:15,550 --> 01:29:16,383
Uh,
you'd like to tweet them out without 

2159
01:29:17,501 --> 01:29:19,270
having even looked at them at all.
Yeah,

2160
01:29:19,330 --> 01:29:20,940
it's,
some of these are there.

2161
01:29:20,980 --> 01:29:21,520
So

2162
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:23,560
there's some studies out there that 
prove you everything.

2163
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:24,460
Wage gap.
He was like,

2164
01:29:24,461 --> 01:29:26,720
so you're telling me I can get the same 
list.

2165
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:27,593
I'm a smart businessman who's made a 
bunch of money and I can get the same 

2166
01:29:30,491 --> 01:29:33,990
level of talent out of this woman are 
better at,

2167
01:29:34,270 --> 01:29:37,360
well let's just say equal,
but 75% or better,

2168
01:29:37,660 --> 01:29:38,560
sorry ma'am,
sorry,

2169
01:29:38,770 --> 01:29:41,610
or or equal or probably better.
Uh,

2170
01:29:41,650 --> 01:29:42,483
personally,
95 cents on the dollar and I'm a smart 

2171
01:29:44,411 --> 01:29:48,100
businessman and I'm not going to go with
the lower costs,

2172
01:29:48,370 --> 01:29:50,470
equal talent,
better talent.

2173
01:29:51,050 --> 01:29:51,883
That's,
that's how can I run a successful 

2174
01:29:53,051 --> 01:29:54,370
business?
Making that kind of decision.

2175
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:55,570
How can you,
yeah,

2176
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:58,040
it would,
they would be hired at far higher rights

2177
01:29:58,530 --> 01:30:00,190
or you can look deeper at it and be 
like,

2178
01:30:00,250 --> 01:30:02,290
oh,
it's just like total jobs or whatever it

2179
01:30:02,291 --> 01:30:02,771
is.
I can't,

2180
01:30:02,771 --> 01:30:03,604
I haven't raised studies,
but I just listened to people who've 

2181
01:30:05,831 --> 01:30:06,540
have,

2182
01:30:06,540 --> 01:30:08,630
I think you're right.
I think there's something to that.

2183
01:30:09,210 --> 01:30:10,043
If they're really could hire the same 
people for the same job and get a woman 

2184
01:30:14,011 --> 01:30:16,440
who's just as good at it for 75 cents,
it's horseshit though.

2185
01:30:16,470 --> 01:30:17,303
They would all at higher only women.
The people who don't know what we're 

2186
01:30:19,171 --> 01:30:21,840
talking about.
It's all based on what jobs you choose.

2187
01:30:22,110 --> 01:30:22,943
It's like it's not that men don't make 
more money because they do the same job 

2188
01:30:25,861 --> 01:30:27,870
and make more money at that job and the 
woman does.

2189
01:30:27,871 --> 01:30:30,480
They do different jobs.
That's where the wage gap is.

2190
01:30:30,481 --> 01:30:33,210
The wage gap is in the number of hours 
that men work,

2191
01:30:33,640 --> 01:30:36,330
the different jobs that they choose,
what they excel in.

2192
01:30:36,570 --> 01:30:40,110
It has nothing to do with like two 
people that are both,

2193
01:30:40,140 --> 01:30:42,230
you know,
in the same line on a,

2194
01:30:42,231 --> 01:30:44,550
on an assembly line or something like 
that with the same amount of time.

2195
01:30:44,650 --> 01:30:46,170
And they both make the same amount of 
money.

2196
01:30:46,340 --> 01:30:47,173
Yeah.
And one or rather the male makes a 

2197
01:30:49,501 --> 01:30:53,790
dollar a dollar for every 75 cents.
That's not how the wage gap works.

2198
01:30:53,791 --> 01:30:54,730
It's just different jobs.

2199
01:30:54,830 --> 01:30:56,060
Okay.
So hearing that information,

2200
01:30:56,061 --> 01:30:58,820
like I remember when I first heard it,
it was like you can either go,

2201
01:30:58,821 --> 01:30:59,654
fuck you.
You're just trying to fucking shit on 

2202
01:31:01,821 --> 01:31:03,050
women or you can go,
Huh,

2203
01:31:03,080 --> 01:31:04,580
well let me,
I've never thought of that.

2204
01:31:04,581 --> 01:31:05,414
Let me look into that a little bit and 
then I'll get back to you instead of 

2205
01:31:07,400 --> 01:31:09,170
immediately reacting.
Fuck off.

2206
01:31:09,260 --> 01:31:10,093
Well,
people get mad like that's not what it 

2207
01:31:10,881 --> 01:31:11,271
is.
Like,

2208
01:31:11,271 --> 01:31:11,901
yes,
it is what?

2209
01:31:11,901 --> 01:31:12,734
It is foolish if you keep arguing with 
me because you don't even know what it 

2210
01:31:15,381 --> 01:31:17,060
is.
This is a dumb conversation.

2211
01:31:17,061 --> 01:31:17,894
Now.
I can't argue with you when I know that 

2212
01:31:19,371 --> 01:31:22,880
you haven't read any of the stuff that 
points to these numbers.

2213
01:31:22,900 --> 01:31:24,250
Like,
look,

2214
01:31:25,060 --> 01:31:29,680
the thing is no one should be like 
whatever you do,

2215
01:31:29,710 --> 01:31:30,543
whatever it is,
whether it is you make incredible 

2216
01:31:33,191 --> 01:31:36,290
sculptures or you build cars,
oh,

2217
01:31:36,291 --> 01:31:38,920
you're a painter.
Whatever the fuck it is that you do,

2218
01:31:39,430 --> 01:31:43,740
no one should be able to say that you 
doing this

2219
01:31:44,360 --> 01:31:47,480
definitely should make as much money as 
doing that.

2220
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:52,030
No things are worth what they're worth.
We remember Tommy Dilutes Bowler.

2221
01:31:52,540 --> 01:31:52,991
Yeah.
Yeah.

2222
01:31:52,991 --> 01:31:57,880
At some point he was ranked I think top 
15 in the world at his sport,

2223
01:31:58,180 --> 01:31:59,530
which is the equivalent,
like

2224
01:31:59,770 --> 01:32:00,603
a,
I'm trying to even think who would be 

2225
01:32:02,170 --> 01:32:05,360
like Carmelo Anthony and this guy,
Tom.

2226
01:32:05,361 --> 01:32:10,361
It dilutes at his sport made 38 grand 
and and fucking and,

2227
01:32:10,690 --> 01:32:13,300
and Carmela makes you know 20 million.
Yeah.

2228
01:32:14,110 --> 01:32:15,460
Sorry.
Your sports not as popular.

2229
01:32:15,490 --> 01:32:17,880
It's just not as popular weight classes 
in his popular whatever,

2230
01:32:17,881 --> 01:32:19,040
how it works.
Yeah.

2231
01:32:19,060 --> 01:32:21,130
That's just how it was not fucking 
assault after.

2232
01:32:21,310 --> 01:32:22,143
Yeah.
I could see how you would want more 

2233
01:32:23,231 --> 01:32:24,070
money.
Yeah,

2234
01:32:24,100 --> 01:32:25,030
sure.
Everybody does.

2235
01:32:25,060 --> 01:32:25,893
I get that.
But like there's certain people that 

2236
01:32:28,901 --> 01:32:30,490
they're just,
it's a harder do that job.

2237
01:32:30,491 --> 01:32:31,324
And the reason why they do it is because
they know that it's more valuable so 

2238
01:32:34,151 --> 01:32:36,450
they work hard.
Definitely get that job done.

2239
01:32:36,680 --> 01:32:39,670
Imagine being the fuck and CEO of a 
corporation.

2240
01:32:39,671 --> 01:32:40,504
How much pressure would be on you all 
the time being fucking Tim Cook over at 

2241
01:32:46,001 --> 01:32:47,780
Apple.
Ah,

2242
01:32:47,810 --> 01:32:49,270
well that's why I don't get paid as much
as him.

2243
01:32:49,330 --> 01:32:50,620
Exactly.
It horrible.

2244
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:51,970
Exactly.
Exactly.

2245
01:32:51,971 --> 01:32:52,804
Well that is the same.
This same philosophy is the reason why 

2246
01:32:55,990 --> 01:32:56,823
women approach now,
and I say some women I should say 

2247
01:32:58,901 --> 01:32:59,734
because there it's like super hyper 
aggressive career oriented women that 

2248
01:33:02,501 --> 01:33:03,334
work as hard or harder than men.
Maybe even harder to prove that there 

2249
01:33:05,651 --> 01:33:06,484
was tough as demand,
but they would take the approach that 

2250
01:33:08,141 --> 01:33:09,550
you and I would take.
I'm like,

2251
01:33:09,551 --> 01:33:11,620
fuck that life.
Like I'm not doing that.

2252
01:33:12,010 --> 01:33:12,843
Whereas it's statistically more males 
push themselves by working longer and 

2253
01:33:17,831 --> 01:33:19,430
harder hours on purpose.
Comparison,

2254
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:22,390
try to succeed.
It's just a natural thing.

2255
01:33:22,391 --> 01:33:23,224
They're trying to win a game.
There's a competition you have is 

2256
01:33:25,001 --> 01:33:26,860
putting points on the board.
By the way,

2257
01:33:26,990 --> 01:33:28,690
serialism realism is fool's game to get 
into.

2258
01:33:28,750 --> 01:33:30,540
Personally.
I see people doing that.

2259
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:31,960
My friends from high school and I'm 
like,

2260
01:33:31,961 --> 01:33:35,500
you're wasting your life for what,
four digit number?

2261
01:33:35,660 --> 01:33:36,341
It's,
it's,

2262
01:33:36,341 --> 01:33:38,980
you're not doing anything with yourself.
The problem is men,

2263
01:33:38,981 --> 01:33:39,814
they get stuck in this loop of 
obligation that get stuck in a loop of 

2264
01:33:42,971 --> 01:33:43,804
children and a mortgage.
And then once you have a car and a nice 

2265
01:33:48,941 --> 01:33:50,980
house and you know,
you maybe you want to get a boat,

2266
01:33:51,220 --> 01:33:52,053
dude,
you get stuck and you have all these 

2267
01:33:53,351 --> 01:33:56,140
payments and obligations and you're not 
going to wear because you have a family.

2268
01:33:56,650 --> 01:33:58,960
Maybe you always wanted to be a rock and
roll singer.

2269
01:33:59,070 --> 01:33:59,591
Yeah,
no,

2270
01:33:59,591 --> 01:34:00,424
and you never fucking got a chance to 
get out of the blocks and you're living 

2271
01:34:02,651 --> 01:34:05,500
your life in this angry state,
unfulfilled,

2272
01:34:05,501 --> 01:34:09,040
angry state.
So the advice is for the young,

2273
01:34:09,290 --> 01:34:10,123
the advices for young people.
The advice is for people that look at 

2274
01:34:12,101 --> 01:34:12,934
their parents and all these other people
that are telling them what they have to 

2275
01:34:14,471 --> 01:34:15,304
do.

2276
01:34:15,550 --> 01:34:19,840
Are they right or the other or is there 
a fucking path out there?

2277
01:34:19,990 --> 01:34:24,640
If you just figure out what you really 
liked to do and just only go that way,

2278
01:34:25,090 --> 01:34:25,923
because if you go this way and then I'm 
gonna take a couple of years off and go 

2279
01:34:28,121 --> 01:34:29,950
that way for a while and then I'm going 
to like,

2280
01:34:30,160 --> 01:34:30,993
I'm going to go back to school and get 
my degree just so I have something to 

2281
01:34:33,311 --> 01:34:34,720
fall back on.
You just didn't,

2282
01:34:34,721 --> 01:34:35,554
you don't,
you didn't get any further down the 

2283
01:34:36,521 --> 01:34:37,660
road.
You're in the same spot.

2284
01:34:37,661 --> 01:34:39,340
You would have been if he didn't do 
shit.

2285
01:34:40,150 --> 01:34:41,530
You got to,
you got to go forward.

2286
01:34:41,710 --> 01:34:43,790
But if you something forward,
even if it's the wrong direction,

2287
01:34:43,791 --> 01:34:46,040
you're still getting experience doing 
something.

2288
01:34:46,470 --> 01:34:47,303
You're finding out what it takes to 
succeed and make a decision on purpose 

2289
01:34:50,411 --> 01:34:52,330
in order to get something you think is 
right.

2290
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:53,673
I don't know what it's like to think 
more and more people are saying no to 

2291
01:34:55,481 --> 01:34:58,100
this old way of doing it and more be,
I want to be outdoors.

2292
01:34:58,100 --> 01:35:00,470
I value friendship over cash,
you know,

2293
01:35:00,471 --> 01:35:01,304
things like that.
Experiences over fucking money and 

2294
01:35:03,081 --> 01:35:03,914
they're starting to go the other way and
they're starting to ask for like when 

2295
01:35:06,381 --> 01:35:07,214
they get their jobs like okay,
I'll take this job but I want six weeks 

2296
01:35:08,901 --> 01:35:10,460
off.
Know I'll take less money,

2297
01:35:10,461 --> 01:35:12,650
but I want more freedom.
People are going for that.

2298
01:35:12,680 --> 01:35:15,820
They are and they should.
There's no tile you,

2299
01:35:15,860 --> 01:35:18,110
there's no time.
There's no time.

2300
01:35:18,140 --> 01:35:20,900
You gotta do what you like.
You got to do stuff you enjoy.

2301
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:22,160
That's why I went to New York.
I was like,

2302
01:35:22,161 --> 01:35:22,994
I saw 40 coming and I was like,
this seems like it's gonna be less and 

2303
01:35:25,071 --> 01:35:26,660
less doable,
you know,

2304
01:35:26,661 --> 01:35:29,840
to pick up and move.
It's certain age ranges.

2305
01:35:29,841 --> 01:35:31,460
I know it's not,
but it just seems like that.

2306
01:35:31,461 --> 01:35:35,960
And so it's like,
go fucking do something you want to do.

2307
01:35:36,020 --> 01:35:36,853
Get going.

2308
01:35:38,660 --> 01:35:40,760
I want you to exercise more dude.
Oh yeah,

2309
01:35:40,761 --> 01:35:43,130
for sure.
I want you to your smart guy.

2310
01:35:43,160 --> 01:35:44,990
Yeah.
And you're,

2311
01:35:44,991 --> 01:35:46,610
you know,
you're in your forties you know,

2312
01:35:46,611 --> 01:35:47,444
you're in your forties it's super 
important to keep your body healthy 

2313
01:35:50,030 --> 01:35:51,680
because he's going to start 
deteriorating.

2314
01:35:51,970 --> 01:35:54,280
I was talking about some of the swing to
it.

2315
01:35:54,281 --> 01:35:56,930
It just starts falling apart.
Man starves the stuff.

2316
01:35:56,931 --> 01:35:59,120
Starts Working Shitty.
See dudes,

2317
01:35:59,121 --> 01:36:00,830
they have,
you know what freaks me out?

2318
01:36:00,831 --> 01:36:02,610
It's my resolutions is here to work out 
more.

2319
01:36:02,611 --> 01:36:03,470
I,
let's do it.

2320
01:36:03,471 --> 01:36:04,161
Come on,
gone up with,

2321
01:36:04,161 --> 01:36:06,200
after all this fucking podcast,
let's get one.

2322
01:36:06,201 --> 01:36:07,034
It's on the lift.
I know it's some cardio cardio machines 

2323
01:36:10,521 --> 01:36:11,780
over here.
I have a versa climber.

2324
01:36:11,810 --> 01:36:13,590
You gotta do it works in a while,
but I got to do it more.

2325
01:36:13,640 --> 01:36:16,700
Just bike for two hours.
Just like one shot around,

2326
01:36:17,100 --> 01:36:17,900
but like fast.

2327
01:36:17,900 --> 01:36:20,780
That's why I like running some outside 
doing something or running around.

2328
01:36:20,781 --> 01:36:21,890
It was cooler.
Yeah.

2329
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:22,850
Yeah.
There's something to it.

2330
01:36:22,851 --> 01:36:24,680
I'm running around,
I see things.

2331
01:36:24,770 --> 01:36:26,380
I'm moving my,
yeah,

2332
01:36:26,570 --> 01:36:28,280
when you're on a machine you just 
fucking,

2333
01:36:28,790 --> 01:36:29,623
unless you're listening to a good book 
on tape or you're watching a television 

2334
01:36:32,841 --> 01:36:34,340
show or something like that,
it's boring.

2335
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:37,520
But when you're running you got to look 
about where you're stupid.

2336
01:36:37,521 --> 01:36:41,030
You're high and watching like some 
cartoon network Shit and running.

2337
01:36:41,090 --> 01:36:44,140
You could go for ever,
could he really cat?

2338
01:36:44,240 --> 01:36:46,610
Yeah.
Music helps you go forever.

2339
01:36:46,760 --> 01:36:49,040
Like there's something about having like
a bad ass song.

2340
01:36:49,041 --> 01:36:50,600
Like you'll,
you don't hear your own breath,

2341
01:36:50,660 --> 01:36:51,493
put some peaches on.
It's like you get a nice rhythm that 

2342
01:36:56,661 --> 01:36:57,494
doesn't freak you out.
Like it freaks me out sometimes when I 

2343
01:36:59,151 --> 01:37:02,540
hear a rhythm of me really pushing hard 
cardio cause I go,

2344
01:37:02,541 --> 01:37:03,770
God damn,
I'm going pretty hard.

2345
01:37:04,240 --> 01:37:06,410
I should back off.
But when you're listening to music,

2346
01:37:06,411 --> 01:37:07,940
you don't even think about it.
You just keep going.

2347
01:37:08,920 --> 01:37:13,730
It's like a little meditative trick 
occupies your mind some weird way.

2348
01:37:13,731 --> 01:37:16,250
It lets you to put like just a little 
extra effort in.

2349
01:37:16,640 --> 01:37:18,260
It's pretty fun.
Plus you gotta get off your phone.

2350
01:37:19,130 --> 01:37:20,630
Yeah.
I can't really be all in there.

2351
01:37:20,631 --> 01:37:22,040
While you're doing that.
Can't be on your phone.

2352
01:37:22,070 --> 01:37:25,160
So it like forces you to go clear for a 
little bit.

2353
01:37:25,190 --> 01:37:26,023
Yeah.
You can't answer calls shit when you're 

2354
01:37:27,021 --> 01:37:29,400
on a fucking treadmill asshole.
Yeah.

2355
01:37:29,540 --> 01:37:30,373
People trying to talk to you.
He hear in the background and they just 

2356
01:37:34,791 --> 01:37:35,810
like,
they're not out of breath.

2357
01:37:35,811 --> 01:37:38,570
They're able to talk normally.
They did that and they do nightclubs.

2358
01:37:38,571 --> 01:37:39,404
Right.
Wrong.

2359
01:37:39,440 --> 01:37:41,570
Kevin Smith's,
the first guy I ever saw that had a desk

2360
01:37:41,571 --> 01:37:44,390
that was a on a treadmill.
He had his desk right here.

2361
01:37:44,810 --> 01:37:46,310
Yeah.
When he first started losing weight,

2362
01:37:46,610 --> 01:37:47,443
he's gone through a few different 
versions of like dieting and changing 

2363
01:37:51,771 --> 01:37:53,210
his diet.
He,

2364
01:37:53,211 --> 01:37:53,710
um,
you know,

2365
01:37:53,710 --> 01:37:55,010
he had a heart attack.
No Way.

2366
01:37:55,050 --> 01:37:57,780
Really had a hard time when he was 
filming of special,

2367
01:37:58,200 --> 01:38:00,420
he filmed two shows,
were supposed to film two shows,

2368
01:38:00,450 --> 01:38:04,680
filmed one and in between shows had a 
fucking heart attack and uh,

2369
01:38:04,950 --> 01:38:07,620
just they was like,
you're having a massive heart attack.

2370
01:38:07,621 --> 01:38:09,380
We're taking you to the hospital queen.
Yup.

2371
01:38:09,390 --> 01:38:10,223
Filmings and he had the kind of heart 
attack that 80% of the people that get 

2372
01:38:12,481 --> 01:38:13,314
it die.
What?

2373
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:14,700
Yeah.
It was a big one.

2374
01:38:14,750 --> 01:38:16,710
Total blockage.
Yeah.

2375
01:38:16,711 --> 01:38:19,620
Total blockage of one of his arteries.
They had to put a stent in him.

2376
01:38:19,870 --> 01:38:20,551
Yeah.
The whole deal.

2377
01:38:20,551 --> 01:38:24,010
And he's lost like a shit load of when a
Shitload,

2378
01:38:24,040 --> 01:38:25,110
wait,
was this recently?

2379
01:38:25,200 --> 01:38:26,033
Yeah,
they'll recently cause he likes to 

2380
01:38:26,911 --> 01:38:27,744
laugh.

2381
01:38:27,790 --> 01:38:29,850
Yeah.
So this was when he lasts.

2382
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:32,070
Lost weight.
Before when I first met him,

2383
01:38:32,310 --> 01:38:34,440
he was I first,
he's a sweetheart of a guy,

2384
01:38:34,470 --> 01:38:36,660
you know him well,
I barely know him.

2385
01:38:36,661 --> 01:38:37,494
I've never met him.
I just talked to my line a couple of 

2386
01:38:38,491 --> 01:38:39,450
times,
like real quick,

2387
01:38:39,830 --> 01:38:42,120
super smart,
like deceptively smart.

2388
01:38:42,220 --> 01:38:44,970
His speeches.
He makes a comicon or fucking glorious.

2389
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:45,960
No,
he's amazing.

2390
01:38:45,990 --> 01:38:47,880
He's an amazing guy and he's a real,
real,

2391
01:38:48,120 --> 01:38:50,050
like a genuine sweetheart.
So when,

2392
01:38:50,051 --> 01:38:50,970
uh,
when I first met him,

2393
01:38:51,210 --> 01:38:53,340
he had a sugar thing.
He just loved sugar.

2394
01:38:53,500 --> 01:38:54,960
Yeah.
He's eating a lot of candy.

2395
01:38:55,350 --> 01:38:59,190
He just loved eat candy.
And then when I met him a sec time,

2396
01:38:59,320 --> 01:39:00,270
um,
uh,

2397
01:39:00,271 --> 01:39:01,104
ran into him,
he decided to go on like a bunch of 

2398
01:39:02,881 --> 01:39:03,714
juice cleanses and shit.
He was just drinking a lot of juice and 

2399
01:39:05,161 --> 01:39:08,670
eat unhealthy food in lost up fuck load 
of weight and that's when he had the uh,

2400
01:39:09,220 --> 01:39:10,053
the,
the treadmill thing with a laptop on 

2401
01:39:12,481 --> 01:39:13,350
this platform.

2402
01:39:13,350 --> 01:39:16,410
So he would walk in and do his work.
Smart moves.

2403
01:39:16,411 --> 01:39:18,180
A lot of that shit's mental.
Like whenever Ralph,

2404
01:39:18,181 --> 01:39:19,770
he got a stomach stayed on now.
Wow.

2405
01:39:19,771 --> 01:39:22,230
It looks like a mouse.
Tiny little face.

2406
01:39:22,590 --> 01:39:23,940
Well,
beautiful tiny face.

2407
01:39:24,270 --> 01:39:25,650
Oh look how fat he was there.
Yeah,

2408
01:39:25,651 --> 01:39:26,484
he got big.
But like as soon as you lose that 

2409
01:39:27,271 --> 01:39:28,104
weight,
you got to see a therapist cover up 

2410
01:39:30,930 --> 01:39:32,040
something.
Yeah,

2411
01:39:32,070 --> 01:39:34,770
there's something,
there's something to it for sure.

2412
01:39:35,640 --> 01:39:38,010
You know,
it's just people get in ruts man,

2413
01:39:38,040 --> 01:39:40,110
because you know,
you get in ruts with your food,

2414
01:39:40,390 --> 01:39:43,950
you get in ruts with your behavior.
But the food one is a big one.

2415
01:39:44,160 --> 01:39:44,993
You know,
that kind of food is just fucking 

2416
01:39:45,991 --> 01:39:47,740
terrible for your body.
You know,

2417
01:39:47,741 --> 01:39:50,550
just constantly consuming sugar.
You're putting your body into a state of

2418
01:39:50,551 --> 01:39:54,930
shock processing this stuff that's never
supposed to be in that form.

2419
01:39:54,990 --> 01:39:58,050
It's a patrice would like Chuck Two 
candy bars and then pass out.

2420
01:39:58,080 --> 01:40:00,450
Oh whose body was trying to process it 
but like,

2421
01:40:00,750 --> 01:40:02,720
Oh hey,
I'd be like what's going on in his body?

2422
01:40:02,760 --> 01:40:03,593
This is what I wanted.
The things I wanted to say to you that 

2423
01:40:04,981 --> 01:40:07,380
one of the things that's fun about you 
going to New York,

2424
01:40:07,381 --> 01:40:08,214
cause you've brought more New York 
insults style to our conversations and 

2425
01:40:12,751 --> 01:40:16,860
our hangs out cause la style is like way
less insulting,

2426
01:40:19,020 --> 01:40:19,853
but you like,
like our group text messages that we 

2427
01:40:21,331 --> 01:40:23,520
have with Bert and topic.
My favorite thing,

2428
01:40:24,260 --> 01:40:25,093
it's a fucking great tax but the,
the insults to each other are hilarious 

2429
01:40:30,121 --> 01:40:34,530
now there's so it's such New York style,
like insult comedy.

2430
01:40:35,360 --> 01:40:37,780
My friends in New York,
there's a guy with an la comedy.

2431
01:40:37,790 --> 01:40:39,720
Do your comedy is always separate before
you came there?

2432
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:42,660
It's true dude.
You've made everybody more in salty.

2433
01:40:43,560 --> 01:40:45,840
I love it.
See the thing is,

2434
01:40:45,841 --> 01:40:49,050
it's fun man.
I love insulting each other.

2435
01:40:49,051 --> 01:40:50,610
Yeah,
it's fucking fun.

2436
01:40:50,700 --> 01:40:51,533
It's silly fun man.
And when someone gets you with a good 

2437
01:40:54,041 --> 01:40:55,450
one it's like,
oh shit.

2438
01:40:56,390 --> 01:40:57,223
Yeah,
that's what he's like ever in La coffee 

2439
01:41:04,961 --> 01:41:06,310
pop.
I didn't know you knew.

2440
01:41:06,311 --> 01:41:07,660
Who had a great point.
Wanda.

2441
01:41:07,661 --> 01:41:08,494
Wanda Sykes said that that was patrice.
Patrice elevated that level and she 

2442
01:41:13,301 --> 01:41:14,710
goes,
she thinks he changed.

2443
01:41:14,950 --> 01:41:16,000
She really said it.
She's like,

2444
01:41:16,001 --> 01:41:20,800
I think he changed the frequency of that
comedy scene in a mosque that's possible

2445
01:41:20,830 --> 01:41:21,663
without,
when got 100% of thing started hugging 

2446
01:41:24,010 --> 01:41:26,590
and he started the hugs in La.
Who started hugs?

2447
01:41:26,830 --> 01:41:30,010
The Guy who died in the car accident,
Josh.

2448
01:41:30,040 --> 01:41:31,990
Josh out of Mars Front.
I can't remember his name now.

2449
01:41:32,020 --> 01:41:33,210
Oh,
I didn't know him that well,

2450
01:41:33,220 --> 01:41:34,780
but he brought hugs back.
He was like,

2451
01:41:34,781 --> 01:41:36,550
if I'm doing that,
and it was curtis spread out in the open

2452
01:41:36,551 --> 01:41:37,040
mic scene.

2453
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:38,800
Took your raw tall.
Well,

2454
01:41:38,801 --> 01:41:39,634
we always hugged sorta,
but he's like constant hugs for hellos 

2455
01:41:42,251 --> 01:41:46,570
where it's like not weird anymore.
I didn't know of him and I independently

2456
01:41:46,571 --> 01:41:47,404
was hugging for hellos notion,
but I think it's great that everybody 

2457
01:41:51,071 --> 01:41:53,010
was doing it.
But teres would hit the Rosen.

2458
01:41:53,020 --> 01:41:54,130
Awesome guy.
Oh yeah,

2459
01:41:54,131 --> 01:41:56,980
I didn't know him.
I don't even think I ever saw him.

2460
01:41:57,340 --> 01:41:58,173
Yeah,
I don't think I ever even saw him do 

2461
01:41:59,171 --> 01:42:00,690
standup.
I think maybe,

2462
01:42:00,790 --> 01:42:02,140
see you went to clubs,
great guy.

2463
01:42:02,141 --> 01:42:02,974
Full of good joke,
right or no one says a bad thing about 

2464
01:42:05,110 --> 01:42:05,943
the guy.
So Patrice would do stuff where he was 

2465
01:42:07,151 --> 01:42:10,180
like Durosu would walk in and he would 
just start making fun of neurosis,

2466
01:42:10,210 --> 01:42:12,070
lack of shoulders.
Oh God.

2467
01:42:12,360 --> 01:42:13,193
He'll be like,
you're fucking Derosa can't wear 

2468
01:42:14,471 --> 01:42:17,270
backpacks cause they fucking fall off.
He goes,

2469
01:42:17,320 --> 01:42:20,530
my favorite one because you brought that
up because Joe Derosa can't have a heart

2470
01:42:20,531 --> 01:42:24,320
to heart with his father because I die 
as much has put his hand on his shoulder

2471
01:42:24,410 --> 01:42:25,243
slides off.

2472
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:28,240
Oh Jesus Christ.
Oh my God.

2473
01:42:28,330 --> 01:42:29,163
I was on the phone calling into opie and
anthony once and it was talking about 

2474
01:42:31,631 --> 01:42:32,464
Anthony's gun collection and I said,

2475
01:42:34,631 --> 01:42:35,770
goes,
I'm strapped everywhere I go,

2476
01:42:35,780 --> 01:42:37,720
I'll go all three out your house 
everywhere you go,

2477
01:42:37,721 --> 01:42:38,321
you're strapped.

2478
01:42:38,321 --> 01:42:39,430
yes,
absolutely.

2479
01:42:39,740 --> 01:42:41,470
I'm like,
do you ever think that like maybe you're

2480
01:42:41,471 --> 01:42:43,870
like manifesting this,
that like by,

2481
01:42:43,871 --> 01:42:45,780
by constantly having guns everywhere

2482
01:42:45,781 --> 01:42:46,614
you're,
you're manifesting potential gun 

2483
01:42:47,891 --> 01:42:51,130
violence and pre patrice goes rogue and 
thinks that kind of shit.

2484
01:42:51,131 --> 01:42:53,860
Cause he,

It's all up on that Magic House fucking 

2486
01:43:00,791 --> 01:43:02,170

And I was like,

2487
01:43:02,200 --> 01:43:06,940
oh my God,
he was so good at jumping on silly shit.

2488
01:43:06,990 --> 01:43:09,680
You were saying pick out like what's

what in the fuck are you wearing?

2491
01:43:13,810 --> 01:43:16,570
And then you just go hard,
hard,

2492
01:43:16,600 --> 01:43:18,520
hard,
and you just got to accept it.

2493
01:43:18,521 --> 01:43:20,530
It's a joke or you'll get mad or you get
bad.

2494
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:22,040
You had to love it.
Dss,

2495
01:43:22,060 --> 01:43:23,840
his own version of that,
you know,

2496
01:43:24,020 --> 01:43:24,853
fuck you.
I told you that one time Diaz was 

2497
01:43:27,161 --> 01:43:31,000
mocking me because I had a notebook,
I didn't know books and he goes,

2498
01:43:31,001 --> 01:43:32,890
what are you do?
We don't want that fucking notebook.

2499
01:43:33,100 --> 01:43:35,380
Let everybody know you're writing belly 
hemingway over here.

2500
01:43:35,700 --> 01:43:37,270
You know as those fucking things people 
don't,

2501
01:43:37,280 --> 01:43:38,113
right.
Like you want to let everybody know 

2502
01:43:39,410 --> 01:43:40,243
you're right.
Get the fuck out of here with a 

2503
01:43:40,841 --> 01:43:41,674
notebook.
He would love where you can see things 

2504
01:43:45,971 --> 01:43:46,804
clear like that.
Taylor has this theory that I love 

2505
01:43:49,340 --> 01:43:50,173
because anytime you hear somebody say 
they're going to start or they're going 

2506
01:43:51,681 --> 01:43:52,160
to start working

2507
01:43:52,160 --> 01:43:53,000
out,
who's that?

2508
01:43:53,001 --> 01:43:57,590
Someone who's telling you they are not 
working out or are not writing.

2509
01:43:58,040 --> 01:44:00,920
Like what do you mean?
You can tell me I've been working out.

2510
01:44:00,980 --> 01:44:01,813
That's a whole separate thing.
I hear a lot what people say are about 

2511
01:44:04,431 --> 01:44:05,810
to start doing something.
The people that are doing,

2512
01:44:05,811 --> 01:44:09,920
so I started using this program from my 
last special,

2513
01:44:09,980 --> 01:44:14,240
I don't want to tell you about scrivener
views yet.

2514
01:44:15,860 --> 01:44:18,110
How it's set up.
It's pretty cool dude.

2515
01:44:18,710 --> 01:44:19,543
It's a game changer.
It's making me organize stuff and it 

2516
01:44:21,620 --> 01:44:22,453
totally different way.
It's nice to have like a little column 

2517
01:44:24,681 --> 01:44:26,990
to the left where I put all subject 
matter.

2518
01:44:26,991 --> 01:44:27,824
And then to the right,
each one of those click and it'll show 

2519
01:44:29,031 --> 01:44:30,650
you all the shit you've written on that 
subject.

2520
01:44:30,870 --> 01:44:33,470
So you could move it around like you,
you can,

2521
01:44:34,040 --> 01:44:35,200
you know,
you could put your,

2522
01:44:35,230 --> 01:44:38,270
your set in order with something like 
that.

2523
01:44:38,930 --> 01:44:40,010
That is,
you know,

2524
01:44:40,170 --> 01:44:42,340
I trying to do I need that for this.
I'm doing this out.

2525
01:44:42,341 --> 01:44:44,510
I'm trying to do all juice stuff.
Oh yeah.

2526
01:44:44,520 --> 01:44:46,910
And I do the thing about the demons and 
the other dimension.

2527
01:44:47,110 --> 01:44:47,943
Yeah.
Nice.

2528
01:44:48,110 --> 01:44:51,540
I'm closing with that back and forth.
But um,

2529
01:44:52,280 --> 01:44:53,810
um,
yeah,

2530
01:44:53,811 --> 01:44:54,644
but then I had to be real conscious of 
like how many like stories about two 

2531
01:44:58,851 --> 01:45:01,850
holidays am I giving,
how many like customs am I giving,

2532
01:45:02,120 --> 01:45:04,460
how much my showing that I have 
expertise on this.

2533
01:45:04,461 --> 01:45:05,810
Like I have to keep reiterating,
you know,

2534
01:45:05,811 --> 01:45:08,540
it'd be like 15 minutes or so,
like show something.

2535
01:45:08,541 --> 01:45:08,901
They're like,
no,

2536
01:45:08,901 --> 01:45:10,250
no,
you should believe me because I'm,

2537
01:45:10,310 --> 01:45:11,170
you know,
put it back in there.

2538
01:45:11,171 --> 01:45:12,860
I'm not saying what's up top doesn't do 
it.

2539
01:45:12,890 --> 01:45:15,960
You have to do a story about me and 
yeshiva in Israel.

2540
01:45:16,310 --> 01:45:16,821
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah,

2541
01:45:16,821 --> 01:45:17,360
yeah,
that's right.

2542
01:45:17,360 --> 01:45:19,220
This guy.
But you have,

2543
01:45:19,250 --> 01:45:20,083
you have the deepest,
you fucking went to Israel and you were 

2544
01:45:23,061 --> 01:45:23,894
studying how many hours a day?
14 maybe you were the literally the 

2545
01:45:28,941 --> 01:45:32,630
Asian equivalent of the Talmud.
The Torah.

2546
01:45:32,660 --> 01:45:35,420
1% that gets into Harvard.
But it's just studying.

2547
01:45:35,530 --> 01:45:36,500
Yeah,
just text.

2548
01:45:36,530 --> 01:45:39,800
I know more about the shit that,
I mean anybody that I know,

2549
01:45:39,890 --> 01:45:40,723
Hobby Lieberman,
know some stuff and Ilan knows a little 

2550
01:45:42,411 --> 01:45:43,940
bit.
But like,

2551
01:45:44,600 --> 01:45:46,310
yeah,
I was so deep in that I'm like,

2552
01:45:46,311 --> 01:45:48,890
and I still have friends that are deep 
end that we like talk about it sometimes

2553
01:45:48,891 --> 01:45:49,621
and the law.
How's that?

2554
01:45:49,621 --> 01:45:51,320
I just,
yeah,

2555
01:45:51,321 --> 01:45:52,460
when my friends ask me like,
what's,

2556
01:45:52,461 --> 01:45:53,430
what's,
what's this customer?

2557
01:45:53,431 --> 01:45:54,320
I'm like,
I'm like,

2558
01:45:54,321 --> 01:45:55,154
and then I see it as it from a fresh 
point of view for the first time in 20 

2559
01:45:57,261 --> 01:45:58,850
years of like,
oh,

2560
01:45:58,851 --> 01:46:02,330
it's just because it represents the 
watson.

2561
01:46:02,330 --> 01:46:04,010
I'm like,
Oh yeah,

2562
01:46:04,610 --> 01:46:06,530
yeah,
like just all the stories,

2563
01:46:06,740 --> 01:46:07,551
all the stories.
So like,

2564
01:46:07,551 --> 01:46:08,384
I'm like,
there's a story of Purim where esther 

2565
01:46:11,770 --> 01:46:13,850
fucking,
I have to go so far back or all days,

2566
01:46:14,090 --> 01:46:14,923
but one of the first feminists in the 
Talmud and the Torah itself was the 

2567
01:46:19,221 --> 01:46:23,180
story of Purim where Vashti,
the queen of the king,

2568
01:46:23,630 --> 01:46:26,150
not Jewish,
was called to say,

2569
01:46:26,151 --> 01:46:26,984
hey,
come in front of my court and show your 

2570
01:46:27,921 --> 01:46:29,110
naked body.
Well,

2571
01:46:29,180 --> 01:46:31,220
and she refused.
She said,

2572
01:46:31,250 --> 01:46:32,083
no,
I'm not doing that.

2573
01:46:32,090 --> 01:46:34,060
It was one of the first feminist 
character spa.

2574
01:46:34,070 --> 01:46:34,821
She said,
no,

2575
01:46:34,821 --> 01:46:35,654
and she was,
she was banished and they looked for 

2576
01:46:36,561 --> 01:46:37,394
another princess and it was this Jewish 
lady that was in hiding about her 

2577
01:46:39,831 --> 01:46:42,200
Judaism forever.
It was weird.

2578
01:46:42,260 --> 01:46:43,100
But anyway,
the Vashi,

2579
01:46:43,101 --> 01:46:43,934
we always viewed her as this great 
feminist leader who could stand up for 

2580
01:46:46,461 --> 01:46:48,020
herself.
And then recently,

2581
01:46:48,250 --> 01:46:50,340
um,
my sephardic Jewish friend who's deep in

2582
01:46:50,341 --> 01:46:51,570
there too,
he pointed,

2583
01:46:51,571 --> 01:46:51,871
I was like,
no,

2584
01:46:51,871 --> 01:46:51,990
no.

2585
01:46:51,990 --> 01:46:54,390
She had herpes.
She had a herpes outbreak.

2586
01:46:54,580 --> 01:46:56,700
She did want to show her body.
She didn't just suddenly,

2587
01:46:56,701 --> 01:46:59,520
that wasn't the first time because he 
did more research on it.

2588
01:46:59,580 --> 01:47:00,413
I know you'd read all the commentary,
the Rashi and all that stuff on there 

2589
01:47:02,580 --> 01:47:04,170
and they bring it down like 
legitimately.

2590
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:06,990
So some stuff he didn't really think 
about and other stuff you're like,

2591
01:47:07,470 --> 01:47:08,910
oh,
oh.

2592
01:47:08,970 --> 01:47:10,740
There was a story of a,
a rabbi who,

2593
01:47:10,770 --> 01:47:11,603
uh,
his students were being killed by a 

2594
01:47:13,411 --> 01:47:16,740
dragon and I read this and I'm like,
it's not supposed to be a metaphor.

2595
01:47:16,770 --> 01:47:19,470
Nothing in this supposed to be metaphor.
It's also means something else.

2596
01:47:19,471 --> 01:47:21,510
Act as metaphor,
but also be real.

2597
01:47:21,690 --> 01:47:22,770
So I'm like,
what's dragging?

2598
01:47:22,771 --> 01:47:24,000
Are you talking about his killing 
students?

2599
01:47:24,180 --> 01:47:26,220
And I showed my rabbi this and he was 
like,

2600
01:47:26,610 --> 01:47:28,200
all right,
this is one metaphor.

2601
01:47:28,770 --> 01:47:29,790
It's jerking off.

2602
01:47:30,060 --> 01:47:30,893
It's masturbation.
They were dying off at night and the 

2603
01:47:32,671 --> 01:47:33,990
rabbi to kill the Dragon.
Oh,

2604
01:47:33,991 --> 01:47:34,824
this is the best part.
The rabbit had killed the dragon hid 

2605
01:47:35,821 --> 01:47:38,130
under one of the students beds until the
dragging attack.

2606
01:47:38,500 --> 01:47:39,151
Yeah.
So I was like,

2607
01:47:39,151 --> 01:47:40,230
what is all this?
And he goes,

2608
01:47:40,231 --> 01:47:41,520
it's masturbation.
I was like,

2609
01:47:41,620 --> 01:47:44,490
oh,
okay.

2610
01:47:44,520 --> 01:47:48,180
Now it makes sense as an adult,
this makes sense to me in a normal way.

2611
01:47:48,780 --> 01:47:53,070
The only metaphor has to do with that.
That's so insane.

2612
01:47:53,100 --> 01:47:53,933
Yeah.
So now I'm starting to look at all that 

2613
01:47:56,161 --> 01:47:59,730
shit from an adult removed point of view
with an insider's knowledge of it.

2614
01:48:00,420 --> 01:48:01,253
Oh,
it's so fun to do it on stage when you 

2615
01:48:02,071 --> 01:48:04,410
can make a crowd who doesn't know 
anything about Judaism,

2616
01:48:04,440 --> 01:48:07,380
understand it and fucking laugh at it.
Wow.

2617
01:48:07,560 --> 01:48:09,690
Yeah.
I'm really having fun now.

2618
01:48:09,810 --> 01:48:11,130
That's awesome.
Yeah,

2619
01:48:11,160 --> 01:48:13,360
that sounds exciting.
I want to see,

2620
01:48:13,380 --> 01:48:14,940
are you going up tonight?

2621
01:48:15,510 --> 01:48:16,111
Uh,
no.

2622
01:48:16,111 --> 01:48:18,120
I'm flying home tonight.
I will be back July.

2623
01:48:18,121 --> 01:48:20,460
Uh,
in July.

2624
01:48:20,461 --> 01:48:23,130
I think I'm running a previous show.
You're talking about that because we had

2625
01:48:23,131 --> 01:48:25,020
always talked about that like years and 
years ago.

2626
01:48:25,021 --> 01:48:26,610
Like you should be talking about that on
stage.

2627
01:48:26,640 --> 01:48:28,590
I wasn't good enough.
I wasn't good enough.

2628
01:48:28,680 --> 01:48:29,291
That's it.
Right.

2629
01:48:29,291 --> 01:48:31,320
And so then I'm trying to cover all the 
subjects too.

2630
01:48:31,321 --> 01:48:32,220
So it's like,
it's not,

2631
01:48:32,250 --> 01:48:33,083
it's weird because I'm not just like 
building an hour and also I'll get 

2632
01:48:35,220 --> 01:48:37,240
inspired by something else.
A homeless faggot,

2633
01:48:38,290 --> 01:48:40,650
sometimes feeding rats outside my 
fucking building.

2634
01:48:41,280 --> 01:48:44,310
Literally loring rats into my fucking 
building.

2635
01:48:45,660 --> 01:48:47,700
Anyways.
So there's bits like that.

2636
01:48:47,701 --> 01:48:49,440
I want to do,
but like this won't go in the hour.

2637
01:48:49,441 --> 01:48:50,274
Was it a homeless guy that was doing it 
was a regular everyone's humanity after 

2638
01:48:55,861 --> 01:48:57,090
a while.
Oh my God,

2639
01:48:57,091 --> 01:49:00,260
that's so fucking heartbreaking.
It's not pictures.

2640
01:49:00,270 --> 01:49:01,103
It's bad enough.

2641
01:49:02,820 --> 01:49:05,850
There's campaigns all over the city.
Put the stuff in trash cans.

2642
01:49:05,851 --> 01:49:07,590
We need to work together to get rid of 
rats.

2643
01:49:07,650 --> 01:49:10,260
It's impossible.
You can lower their numbers.

2644
01:49:10,261 --> 01:49:12,270
You've seen the netflix thing right on 
rats.

2645
01:49:12,330 --> 01:49:13,440
You haven't seen him?
No.

2646
01:49:13,530 --> 01:49:14,940
Oh,
you poor back in New York.

2647
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,910
Oh,
that's the worst part of that city.

2648
01:49:18,180 --> 01:49:21,210
It's in saint.
This documentary is insane.

2649
01:49:21,480 --> 01:49:22,313
You Watch that documentary.
You have a whole new understanding of 

2650
01:49:24,121 --> 01:49:24,954
what you're dealing with.
There's like a little tiny army of 

2651
01:49:26,521 --> 01:49:30,480
creatures that live amongst the New 
Yorkers that outnumber the New Yorkers.

2652
01:49:30,481 --> 01:49:32,540
There's more,
lots a lot,

2653
01:49:32,910 --> 01:49:34,990
and they're smart and they showed how 
you eat.

2654
01:49:34,991 --> 01:49:35,824
It's hard.
It is to kill them because they sent 

2655
01:49:37,081 --> 01:49:37,914
dumb young ones out and to eat the 
poison first and they die and then they 

2656
01:49:40,561 --> 01:49:41,870
avoid it.
I'm making money.

2657
01:49:41,950 --> 01:49:43,710
I'm thinking of getting a cat from my 
backyard.

2658
01:49:43,740 --> 01:49:44,550
This is it,
dude.

2659
01:49:44,550 --> 01:49:46,950
And it follows these exterminators cats 
are good,

2660
01:49:47,260 --> 01:49:48,093
cancel help a lot,
but I just don't want you to hear a cat 

2661
01:49:49,780 --> 01:49:50,613
but they've got to piss all over.
They'll piss everywhere to borrow cat 

2662
01:49:52,391 --> 01:49:54,010
for like a week.
They'll piss all over you.

2663
01:49:54,011 --> 01:49:54,501
You are,
you are.

2664
01:49:54,501 --> 01:49:55,334
I will smell funky but they will kill a 
lot of these fuckers but the thing is 

2665
01:49:58,241 --> 01:50:00,430
maybe not going to kill them all.
You just not,

2666
01:50:00,670 --> 01:50:01,503
oh,
turn this off in New York has a giant 

2667
01:50:04,091 --> 01:50:04,811
problem,
man.

2668
01:50:04,811 --> 01:50:06,160
I was walking down the middle of the 
street,

2669
01:50:06,190 --> 01:50:07,900
the middle of 12th Avenue,
12th Street.

2670
01:50:08,170 --> 01:50:10,240
That was a bot fly.
That was in one of them.

2671
01:50:10,390 --> 01:50:12,610
They have all had parasites.
Tell us the story.

2672
01:50:12,611 --> 01:50:15,610
You were walking down the middle of the 
street on the sidewalk down the middle,

2673
01:50:15,611 --> 01:50:17,290
straight to the seller.
Late one night,

2674
01:50:17,291 --> 01:50:20,740
like two 33 in the morning and this cop 
pulls up behind me and was like,

2675
01:50:20,741 --> 01:50:22,500
we're bored and I fucking moved over.

2676
01:50:22,510 --> 01:50:23,920
He's like,
what do you do good on the sidewalk?

2677
01:50:24,220 --> 01:50:25,053
This like early I moved to New York.
It's like there's rats on the sidewalk 

2678
01:50:27,310 --> 01:50:29,920
and I can't because I think they put the
fucking trash out.

2679
01:50:29,960 --> 01:50:30,793
So had the small space and the trash 
starts to move and Russell and it's a 

2680
01:50:34,721 --> 01:50:37,690
fucking rat or more and they just dart 
in front of you.

2681
01:50:37,720 --> 01:50:38,553
What?
Hit My foot once wondering biting my 

2682
01:50:39,491 --> 01:50:41,050
foot.
I don't text and walk anymore.

2683
01:50:41,170 --> 01:50:42,520
I fucking keep my eye on him at all the 
time.

2684
01:50:42,580 --> 01:50:44,480
So I'm walking in the street and I 
fucking yell,

2685
01:50:44,500 --> 01:50:45,281
let's level,
sorry.

2686
01:50:45,281 --> 01:50:47,860
I get into it when I talk about stuff,
but I yelled at this level at the cop.

2687
01:50:47,950 --> 01:50:49,370
I can't,
there's fucking rat.

2688
01:50:49,450 --> 01:50:50,320
And he was like,
oh right.

2689
01:50:50,321 --> 01:50:52,120
I didn't just look at it.
Let me go in the middle of the street.

2690
01:50:55,010 --> 01:50:56,260
Oh,
you see them move.

2691
01:50:56,261 --> 01:50:57,640
Something shouldn't move within.
It does.

2692
01:50:57,641 --> 01:51:01,610
He's like fucking ivy vine by the store 
full of rat.

2693
01:51:01,620 --> 01:51:02,453
They just start moving.
I really feel like you're tripping on 

2694
01:51:03,551 --> 01:51:04,384
shrooms.
Yeah,

2695
01:51:04,450 --> 01:51:06,070
it's creepy.
That little viney.

2696
01:51:06,160 --> 01:51:08,710
That's a creepy as vine.
Anyway,

2697
01:51:08,711 --> 01:51:10,450
so I bits like that,
that I put aside.

2698
01:51:10,510 --> 01:51:11,980
I do sometimes,
but the rest is like,

2699
01:51:11,981 --> 01:51:14,070
I got to cover this hour.
I could cover all the deets.

2700
01:51:14,080 --> 01:51:16,930
I can't leave anything out.
It can't leave anything out.

2701
01:51:17,020 --> 01:51:18,490
So it's like,
yeah,

2702
01:51:18,550 --> 01:51:20,890
that shit sounds perfect for like how 
much to build in.

2703
01:51:21,190 --> 01:51:22,960
Yeah,
you a,

2704
01:51:22,961 --> 01:51:25,270
we always talked about that stuff,
but it's cool now that you,

2705
01:51:25,480 --> 01:51:26,450
yeah,
I'm a little bit,

2706
01:51:26,880 --> 01:51:28,930
I'm a little better as a comic 10 years 
later.

2707
01:51:28,980 --> 01:51:29,320
Well,
you know,

2708
01:51:29,320 --> 01:51:33,730
I think it's also learning how to write 
things and I'm putting them in order.

2709
01:51:34,180 --> 01:51:35,013
You know how to move stuff around and 
how to set it up when you're talking 

2710
01:51:37,691 --> 01:51:39,040
about something that's that crazy.

2711
01:51:39,160 --> 01:51:39,993
What do you think of it now?
Like now that you know so much about it 

2712
01:51:42,790 --> 01:51:46,570
and you've been an whatever you would 
consider yourself agnostic or an atheist

2713
01:51:46,900 --> 01:51:49,810
for solar,
what do you think it originally was?

2714
01:51:49,840 --> 01:51:50,673
What do you mean?
Like what started all this religious 

2715
01:51:52,420 --> 01:51:54,240
writings and teachings?
What do you,

2716
01:51:54,280 --> 01:51:56,950
what do you think they were?
Do you think that humanity meets people?

2717
01:51:57,730 --> 01:51:59,270
Like the tour of the town would,
yeah,

2718
01:51:59,271 --> 01:52:00,104
it was a way to keep your group going 
and then you make laws and how to live 

2719
01:52:02,501 --> 01:52:05,510
inside your group.
So it's just a section of laws really is

2720
01:52:05,520 --> 01:52:07,330
how we're in the be.
How'd they agree?

2721
01:52:08,770 --> 01:52:09,603
Agreed that this,
well the [inaudible] is really 

2722
01:52:11,921 --> 01:52:14,110
interesting because they take this,
I don't know if ever told you this,

2723
01:52:14,440 --> 01:52:15,273
the high faith they take the 
similarities between all religions like 

2724
01:52:17,741 --> 01:52:19,390
do not kill is almost in all of them.

2725
01:52:19,570 --> 01:52:21,610
So they go,
that must be a truth straight from God.

2726
01:52:21,880 --> 01:52:23,500
And maybe the churches sort of 
disseminated,

2727
01:52:23,501 --> 01:52:25,060
made him weird.
Oh yeah.

2728
01:52:25,061 --> 01:52:25,894
The church is what?
Like you like molded those towards your 

2729
01:52:28,241 --> 01:52:30,880
own like uh,
population.

2730
01:52:31,330 --> 01:52:32,163
So like Christians,
the fucking one of some of the weakest 

2731
01:52:34,031 --> 01:52:36,760
ones.
So they can't eat meat the whole lent.

2732
01:52:36,850 --> 01:52:37,900
And they go,
well we don't like that.

2733
01:52:37,901 --> 01:52:38,734
And they go,
fucking,

2734
01:52:39,100 --> 01:52:41,260
how about just let me know Friday?
And they go,

2735
01:52:41,350 --> 01:52:42,183
all right,
well except that for awhile and these 

2736
01:52:43,151 --> 01:52:45,430
fucking weak ass nonreligious people.
And they go,

2737
01:52:45,500 --> 01:52:46,040
well that's true.

2738
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:47,240
How about I just give up something?
And the,

2739
01:52:47,510 --> 01:52:48,410
the church,
it's like,

2740
01:52:48,411 --> 01:52:49,244
well,
either we're going to lose you or we'll 

2741
01:52:49,641 --> 01:52:53,270
give in some of them there's no Gif.
They're just like,

2742
01:52:53,271 --> 01:52:55,370
this is the rule right there near out,
right?

2743
01:52:55,850 --> 01:52:56,301
Yeah.
Look,

2744
01:52:56,301 --> 01:53:00,470
some of them changed holidays and still 
you do it to control your own population

2745
01:53:00,500 --> 01:53:02,000
with laws to help you.
I mean,

2746
01:53:02,060 --> 01:53:02,893
don't kill,
it helps you live as a society so you 

2747
01:53:05,091 --> 01:53:05,924
can like be okay with each other.
It's a high takes the similarities in 

2748
01:53:07,790 --> 01:53:10,730
all of them and so like don't kill the 
story of the flood.

2749
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:12,710
That's a real similar thing that lots of
religions,

2750
01:53:12,711 --> 01:53:13,544
so that must be a real thing that 
happened and then the the don't eat pig 

2751
01:53:18,111 --> 01:53:19,610
is like nat,
that's just a Jew thing.

2752
01:53:19,760 --> 01:53:22,100
Don't worry about that.
I think that's a trick of gnosis thing.

2753
01:53:23,180 --> 01:53:24,670
That's not the,
yeah,

2754
01:53:26,210 --> 01:53:27,980
the origin maybe.

2755
01:53:28,040 --> 01:53:28,873
Yeah.
I think that people were dying from it 

2756
01:53:30,201 --> 01:53:32,690
and also the shellfish thing because of 
red tide,

2757
01:53:32,930 --> 01:53:34,830
they go if they didn't know when to 
accurately predict,

2758
01:53:34,831 --> 01:53:35,330
you know,
cer,

2759
01:53:35,330 --> 01:53:37,940
certain times of the year,
shellfish are absolutely toxic.

2760
01:53:37,970 --> 01:53:38,810
Oh really?
Yeah.

2761
01:53:38,811 --> 01:53:40,170
It's called.
Yeah.

2762
01:53:40,610 --> 01:53:43,670
I don't know when it is,
when I always wanted to know when it is.

2763
01:53:43,790 --> 01:53:44,623
But you can't get like clams and mussels
from certain beaches during certain 

2764
01:53:48,891 --> 01:53:51,380
times of the year.
You can't cause it's tower and humanity.

2765
01:53:51,381 --> 01:53:52,570
That's why I could have started for 
sure.

2766
01:53:52,590 --> 01:53:53,423
For sure.
No rabbis and telling me the reason we 

2767
01:53:54,411 --> 01:53:56,960
don't eat pig is because God said right 
and that's the end of it.

2768
01:53:57,020 --> 01:53:57,853
Well I think that they probably ate it 
and probably try to eat it raw and 

2769
01:54:01,701 --> 01:54:04,570
people got deathly ill and children died
now.

2770
01:54:04,640 --> 01:54:05,473
That's what I think,
you know,

2771
01:54:05,540 --> 01:54:08,420
whenever I'm like don't after enough 
many generations that you don't,

2772
01:54:08,421 --> 01:54:08,780
it's like why?

2773
01:54:08,780 --> 01:54:09,990
It's like our God,
you know?

2774
01:54:10,150 --> 01:54:10,761
Here it is.
The Sun,

2775
01:54:10,761 --> 01:54:11,594
God says tide as a phenomenon caused by 
algae blooms during which algae becomes 

2776
01:54:14,601 --> 01:54:16,130
so numerous that it does color,
blah,

2777
01:54:16,131 --> 01:54:16,401
blah,
blah,

2778
01:54:16,401 --> 01:54:17,120
blah,
blah.

2779
01:54:17,120 --> 01:54:20,930
The release toxins that may cause 
illnesses in humans or other animals.

2780
01:54:21,470 --> 01:54:22,303
Huh.
So this is for whatever it is that 

2781
01:54:24,380 --> 01:54:25,370
Google,
red tide,

2782
01:54:25,371 --> 01:54:27,380
shellfish.
I'm just trying to figure out why you're

2783
01:54:27,381 --> 01:54:31,220
not,
is it red tide shellfish here?

2784
01:54:31,280 --> 01:54:35,390
I think they might be talking about a 
slightly different thing.

2785
01:54:35,450 --> 01:54:36,620
Nope.
It's the same stuff.

2786
01:54:37,280 --> 01:54:42,280
So consumption of shellfish that are 
contaminants by the toxins can Taz,

2787
01:54:42,680 --> 01:54:45,260
neurotoxic,
shellfish poisoning.

2788
01:54:46,130 --> 01:54:46,963
NSP symptoms usually appear when a 
couple of hours of eating contaminated 

2789
01:54:50,061 --> 01:54:53,360
shellfish and they last for a few days,
so that is red tide.

2790
01:54:53,540 --> 01:54:58,250
So most likely something like that.
I can say that the reason why they chose

2791
01:54:58,251 --> 01:55:01,820
to not eat shellfish and tricking gnosis
is really common.

2792
01:55:01,820 --> 01:55:03,110
And pigs,
because they eat everything.

2793
01:55:03,111 --> 01:55:05,180
They eat rats,
pigs eat everything they can.

2794
01:55:05,210 --> 01:55:07,940
They ground nesting birds.
The I could for sure.

2795
01:55:07,941 --> 01:55:10,640
See that's why.
That's why that started up and obviously

2796
01:55:10,641 --> 01:55:13,360
like the don't fucking nerve.
His wife that's so I move,

2797
01:55:14,130 --> 01:55:16,760
I'll be fighting.
Just Scott says don't do that.

2798
01:55:16,780 --> 01:55:17,571
Yeah.
God says,

2799
01:55:17,571 --> 01:55:19,010
stop fucking everybody.
Yeah.

2800
01:55:19,340 --> 01:55:20,240
Yeah.
There's a,

2801
01:55:20,480 --> 01:55:22,580
there's some of them that are real 
universal's right.

2802
01:55:22,600 --> 01:55:24,500
They travel from every,
every religion.

2803
01:55:24,530 --> 01:55:25,363
It's like people figured out rules that 
you should operate by to have a 

2804
01:55:28,281 --> 01:55:30,220
harmonious existence with your 
neighbors.

2805
01:55:30,590 --> 01:55:32,180
Yeah.
But then other ones,

2806
01:55:32,181 --> 01:55:33,014
it's just ridiculous.
Now that I'm stepped back and someone 

2807
01:55:34,780 --> 01:55:36,170
will ask me about a of mock,
oh,

2808
01:55:37,330 --> 01:55:38,163
I just started laughing about what the 
purpose was and how it looks from the 

2809
01:55:40,071 --> 01:55:44,430
outside.
We've talked about the one that's in Old

2810
01:55:44,430 --> 01:55:45,263
Testament where God sends a bunch of 
bears down to kill kids because they 

2811
01:55:48,661 --> 01:55:50,220
were making fun of this guy being bald.

2812
01:55:50,550 --> 01:55:52,330
What?
Yes.

2813
01:55:52,380 --> 01:55:53,520
Really?
Some of these,

2814
01:55:53,521 --> 01:55:55,060
I don't even know.
That's a crazy thing.

2815
01:55:55,230 --> 01:55:57,420
This is one of the best ones ever.
This guy is,

2816
01:55:57,421 --> 01:55:58,254
he's,
these kids are taunting this guy and 

2817
01:55:59,731 --> 01:56:03,120
calling him bald and so God sends these 
bears.

2818
01:56:03,121 --> 01:56:05,250
This guy's doing God's work and God 
protects his people.

2819
01:56:05,670 --> 01:56:08,940
God sends some fucking,
she bears to eat these kids,

2820
01:56:10,890 --> 01:56:13,030
dude,
pull it up so I can,

2821
01:56:13,750 --> 01:56:14,700
right.
Here it is.

2822
01:56:14,910 --> 01:56:15,743
Oh,
Alicia,

2823
01:56:15,930 --> 01:56:16,763
Alicia and the two bears make that a 
little beer for my shitty sort of 

2824
01:56:19,050 --> 01:56:20,740
profits.
Yeah.

2825
01:56:21,030 --> 01:56:23,610
This is the way it's described as 
hilarious.

2826
01:56:24,570 --> 01:56:27,990
Whereas you're bald head.
This is what they're saying.

2827
01:56:27,991 --> 01:56:30,240
Go up you bald head to him.
Uh,

2828
01:56:30,241 --> 01:56:33,960
when he looked behind him and saw them,
he cursed them in the name of the Lord,

2829
01:56:33,961 --> 01:56:38,590
all caps.
Then two female came out of the woods,

2830
01:56:38,740 --> 01:56:42,270
tore up 42 lads up their number and he 
went,

2831
01:56:42,750 --> 01:56:44,250
that is fucking insane.

2832
01:56:44,250 --> 01:56:47,260
You're supposed to read into that.
Here's the actual thing.

2833
01:56:47,520 --> 01:56:50,880
So like some shit was happening baby.
Maybe a different time,

2834
01:56:50,881 --> 01:56:51,714
maybe not like fun and then fucking 
bears killed a bunch of these people 

2835
01:56:54,600 --> 01:56:55,910
that happened.
Yeah.

2836
01:56:55,930 --> 01:56:56,763
For just had to read into why the for 
sure definitely people got killed by 

2837
01:57:00,241 --> 01:57:05,190
bears but lived inside a whale and they 
didn't say miracle on that.

2838
01:57:05,400 --> 01:57:06,233
They just said the way later but didn't 
fucking swallow and he was just there 

2839
01:57:08,430 --> 01:57:10,100
like the Pelican.
What the fuck did,

2840
01:57:10,110 --> 01:57:13,010
I just was operating from it.
Not An understanding of how things work.

2841
01:57:14,550 --> 01:57:15,383
Yeah.
Like where they made star wars in 

2842
01:57:16,261 --> 01:57:17,440
fucking,
what's the name of shooting that?

2843
01:57:17,441 --> 01:57:18,274
That rudder and it was just open to 
space because we didn't know yet that 

2844
01:57:21,751 --> 01:57:22,081
like,
oh,

2845
01:57:22,081 --> 01:57:25,140
that'll just kill you.
You can't just have open the space.

2846
01:57:25,141 --> 01:57:26,520
You need like a barrier there.

2847
01:57:26,760 --> 01:57:27,593
Yeah.
That would be like 250 degrees below 

2848
01:57:28,531 --> 01:57:32,670
zero just like it's an open window is 
firing out.

2849
01:57:32,760 --> 01:57:33,930
Yeah.
You can't do that.

2850
01:57:34,320 --> 01:57:35,153
But we didn't know any better.
It's like not sounds right or you can 

2851
01:57:37,191 --> 01:57:38,024
live inside a whale.
Like if you're in space and someone 

2852
01:57:39,811 --> 01:57:44,500
breaks the window shoot match if you're 
in some s cause you know that number,

2853
01:57:44,501 --> 01:57:45,930
that alien,
that one alien movie,

2854
01:57:46,830 --> 01:57:51,020
the bullet hole he got dragged out.
That was pretty bad ass.

2855
01:57:51,420 --> 01:57:52,253
But what's his face?
Bayzos is going to offer flights to 

2856
01:57:54,211 --> 01:57:55,800
space.
Do you know that?

2857
01:57:55,801 --> 01:57:57,990
Right?
Like I'm a 2019 that's a good question.

2858
01:57:58,350 --> 01:58:02,910
I saw him two days ago.
I would be willing to pay.

2859
01:58:02,940 --> 01:58:05,580
Would you be willing to pay 10 grand,
10 grand,

2860
01:58:05,650 --> 01:58:07,230
20 I think.
I think 20 grants.

2861
01:58:07,231 --> 01:58:09,120
The first number that came to mind was 
50 but that's a lot.

2862
01:58:09,390 --> 01:58:10,223
A lot.

2863
01:58:10,350 --> 01:58:14,100
But for the experience I might think 
would be good though.

2864
01:58:14,520 --> 01:58:16,200
Yeah.
It's can't just be get up and go back.

2865
01:58:16,201 --> 01:58:17,730
Now you're right.
What if it's fucking lame?

2866
01:58:18,500 --> 01:58:21,450
You got to take 10 10 number one flat 
earth.

2867
01:58:21,451 --> 01:58:23,820
Conspiracist he should be the first one 
to go for sure.

2868
01:58:24,430 --> 01:58:25,470
You got to tell everybody,
man,

2869
01:58:25,500 --> 01:58:27,420
you've gotta be willing to tell 
everybody what you see.

2870
01:58:27,480 --> 01:58:29,970
Tell everybody it's a ball.
It's a ball.

2871
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,490
There is no rocket.
It is all CGI.

2872
01:58:33,080 --> 01:58:34,860
Everything is artificial.
We live in,

2873
01:58:34,890 --> 01:58:36,810
it's been proven.
We live in a hologram.

2874
01:58:37,610 --> 01:58:38,443
Hey,
what questions you want to ask me about 

2875
01:58:39,180 --> 01:58:40,470
anthony?
Bordain well,

2876
01:58:40,471 --> 01:58:41,304
I wanted to talk to you about suicidal 
thoughts because you are out of the 

2877
01:58:45,281 --> 01:58:49,240
people that didn't kill themselves with 
you are a lot,

2878
01:58:49,241 --> 01:58:50,074
huh?
The one who knows the most about it and 

2879
01:58:52,670 --> 01:58:55,420
you've experienced depression,
you know,

2880
01:58:55,421 --> 01:58:56,254
and when I wasn't close with Anthony 
Bordain but I really liked him a lot 

2881
01:59:00,630 --> 01:59:01,463
when I'm with you.

2882
01:59:01,480 --> 01:59:02,530
Yeah.
And when I hung out with him,

2883
01:59:02,531 --> 01:59:04,750
I really enjoyed it.
I did a show,

2884
01:59:06,070 --> 01:59:06,903
we did an episode of his show in Montana
and we went camping together and got 

2885
01:59:10,031 --> 01:59:11,680
fucked up by a campfire.
Yeah,

2886
01:59:11,681 --> 01:59:12,550
it was great.
We had a great,

2887
01:59:12,551 --> 01:59:14,170
great old time.
It was really fun.

2888
01:59:14,320 --> 01:59:18,550
But I was stunned when that happened.
And,

2889
01:59:18,551 --> 01:59:20,440
uh,
I mean I don't,

2890
01:59:20,860 --> 01:59:22,060
I just wanted to know,
like,

2891
01:59:22,061 --> 01:59:22,894
when you were at your worst,
when you were having like really shitty 

2892
01:59:25,721 --> 01:59:26,554
feelings,
like what could have been anything that 

2893
01:59:30,041 --> 01:59:32,050
someone could have done that could have 
helped you?

2894
01:59:32,200 --> 01:59:33,580
Oh yeah.
I think about this too.

2895
01:59:33,581 --> 01:59:35,380
I lost a friend,
a suicide and it was like,

2896
01:59:37,780 --> 01:59:39,250
yeah,
you want to stop because like what,

2897
01:59:39,420 --> 01:59:40,660
what,
what could you have done?

2898
01:59:40,720 --> 01:59:42,310
Right.
Yeah.

2899
01:59:42,490 --> 01:59:45,740
I mean sometimes just all fall on me 
into a therapist that fuck,

2900
01:59:45,770 --> 01:59:46,603
I couldn't afford.

2901
01:59:47,110 --> 01:59:48,040
I mean,
I've told you this before,

2902
01:59:48,041 --> 01:59:51,310
I probably on here.
That was like a physical thing to do,

2903
01:59:51,340 --> 01:59:54,640
but just getting me to go to accept like
that,

2904
01:59:54,641 --> 01:59:56,000
maybe it'll work well,
I,

2905
01:59:56,080 --> 01:59:56,913
I knew when I was talking to you,
that is a hard thing for you to talk 

2906
02:00:00,071 --> 02:00:01,450
about.
So if you're bringing it up,

2907
02:00:01,480 --> 02:00:03,310
it's a real,
real issue.

2908
02:00:03,430 --> 02:00:04,140
Yeah.
Yeah.

2909
02:00:04,140 --> 02:00:05,380
It's,
you're stoic.

2910
02:00:05,590 --> 02:00:06,590
Yeah.
You're,

2911
02:00:06,670 --> 02:00:08,490
you're not,
you don't complain about that.

2912
02:00:08,850 --> 02:00:10,530
People with my negative stuff,
he's done.

2913
02:00:10,840 --> 02:00:13,480
So I remember we were playing pool and I
was like,

2914
02:00:13,600 --> 02:00:15,580
what's matter?
Like there's something going on.

2915
02:00:16,470 --> 02:00:17,303
Like you just seem like just unhappy or,
and so once we got you into that 

2916
02:00:21,671 --> 02:00:22,504
psychiatrist and dude,
you popped out of that thing like a 

2917
02:00:24,371 --> 02:00:26,950
fucking spring pills.
Yeah.

2918
02:00:26,951 --> 02:00:27,850
Neat.
We went running,

2919
02:00:27,851 --> 02:00:29,980
like anybody who thinks that pills are 
all bad,

2920
02:00:30,730 --> 02:00:32,170
I don't think anything's all anything.

2921
02:00:32,470 --> 02:00:35,170
I think I know the black and white 
problem where there are people,

2922
02:00:35,171 --> 02:00:36,990
like I talked to Benji won,
it seems like there are over prescribing

2923
02:00:36,991 --> 02:00:37,301
pills.
I'm like,

2924
02:00:37,301 --> 02:00:38,620
they worked for me and he's like,
well,

2925
02:00:38,710 --> 02:00:39,550
I probably didn't.
And I'm like,

2926
02:00:39,551 --> 02:00:39,701
no,
no,

2927
02:00:39,701 --> 02:00:40,534
no.
Just because you think they're over 

2928
02:00:41,021 --> 02:00:42,820
prescribing it doesn't mean they should 
never prescribed.

2929
02:00:42,850 --> 02:00:43,770
Right.
It's,

2930
02:00:44,170 --> 02:00:45,003
there's stuff that works and sometimes 
it works enough for you to just change 

2931
02:00:47,891 --> 02:00:48,724
your way of looking at the world and 
change your reality and then you 

2932
02:00:52,511 --> 02:00:56,020
eventually weaned yourself off of them,
which is really interesting.

2933
02:00:56,050 --> 02:00:56,883
Well,
it's a sprain of the brain muscle is 

2934
02:00:59,231 --> 02:01:01,120
what's happened.
Um,

2935
02:01:02,320 --> 02:01:03,700
I don't,
it's not like a physical,

2936
02:01:03,701 --> 02:01:05,540
like pull like that.
Um,

2937
02:01:05,560 --> 02:01:07,480
but that's really what it is.
Just a sprain.

2938
02:01:07,481 --> 02:01:09,390
And so like until you get off it,
uh,

2939
02:01:09,430 --> 02:01:10,263
to get on a cast,
if some way it's going to be real hard 

2940
02:01:12,071 --> 02:01:12,904
for it to heal.

2941
02:01:13,540 --> 02:01:14,373
You know,
this is like so far this metaphor works 

2942
02:01:17,990 --> 02:01:18,823
that does work.
It works in the most effective cases 

2943
02:01:21,490 --> 02:01:26,320
like yours of medication.
So these pills act as a cast and then at

2944
02:01:26,321 --> 02:01:29,320
some point you're healed and you don't 
need them anymore.

2945
02:01:29,770 --> 02:01:30,603
But the problem is the only way to 
really know is if you just get off it 

2946
02:01:34,231 --> 02:01:35,800
and run on it and then you're like,
oh fuck,

2947
02:01:35,801 --> 02:01:36,820
I'm still hurt.
Yeah.

2948
02:01:36,830 --> 02:01:37,663
And during that get off and run on a 
time is you're suicidal thoughts shoot 

2949
02:01:41,001 --> 02:01:43,910
up if they were going to.
So when they do wean you off,

2950
02:01:43,940 --> 02:01:46,010
they're like you need to keep up with 
me.

2951
02:01:46,070 --> 02:01:46,903
Like anything you get,
you need to call me immediately you can 

2952
02:01:49,391 --> 02:01:50,224
to write back on like what was 
interesting with you is you are weaning 

2953
02:01:53,331 --> 02:01:57,740
off coincided with huge success in your 
career.

2954
02:01:58,580 --> 02:01:59,890
Yeah,
I got off him,

2955
02:02:00,050 --> 02:02:02,630
I know where I got off on,
it was my second apartment in New York.

2956
02:02:03,200 --> 02:02:08,200
So this was three and a half years ago,
four years ago maybe around there.

2957
02:02:08,810 --> 02:02:11,240
This is not happening is already on 
comedy central.

2958
02:02:11,640 --> 02:02:13,190
It's things are going,
things are going good.

2959
02:02:13,191 --> 02:02:14,450
Your tours,
kicking ass,

2960
02:02:14,520 --> 02:02:15,353
everything's great.
And then you released my first hour and 

2961
02:02:18,081 --> 02:02:19,670
then my second hour.
Yeah.

2962
02:02:19,800 --> 02:02:23,350
And you were a legit success.
He'll blow up.

2963
02:02:23,360 --> 02:02:26,170
Was getting you were on billboards.
So beyond that I was,

2964
02:02:26,171 --> 02:02:27,004
uh,
I mean more importantly was I was a 

2965
02:02:27,921 --> 02:02:29,570
working comic.
I was like,

2966
02:02:29,630 --> 02:02:31,940
oh,
I can make a real living at this now for

2967
02:02:31,941 --> 02:02:34,340
the first time.
So that was like the best part.

2968
02:02:34,700 --> 02:02:37,220
Yeah.
And that hadn't been going on very long,

2969
02:02:37,370 --> 02:02:38,270
right?
Well,

2970
02:02:38,300 --> 02:02:39,680
it was a hot,
it's a fucking,

2971
02:02:40,010 --> 02:02:42,290
people don't know.
People don't know.

2972
02:02:42,291 --> 02:02:43,124
It's a fucking crazy struggle.
The struggle from open Miker to 

2973
02:02:45,981 --> 02:02:48,560
successful working comedian and 
everybody's different,

2974
02:02:48,561 --> 02:02:50,960
everybody's got their own weirdness that
they have to overcome,

2975
02:02:51,350 --> 02:02:53,630
but it's a long ass bloody struggle.

2976
02:02:53,660 --> 02:02:54,650
That's true.
By the way.

2977
02:02:54,680 --> 02:02:56,930
That's why I hate this infighting and 
comedy.

2978
02:02:56,960 --> 02:02:58,850
It's terrible.
And it's like you're doing this wrong,

2979
02:02:58,851 --> 02:02:59,660
your dog.
I said,

2980
02:02:59,660 --> 02:03:02,420
guys,
we're all up against the most monumental

2981
02:03:02,421 --> 02:03:04,450
odds.
So you write safety,

2982
02:03:04,480 --> 02:03:06,950
safe show jokes and this guy writes Dick
Jokes.

2983
02:03:07,420 --> 02:03:09,170
It's like whatever.
That's just like predispositions,

2984
02:03:09,171 --> 02:03:13,880
but like it's hard.
We're all in the same boat anyway.

2985
02:03:13,910 --> 02:03:15,020
Yeah,
I agree man.

2986
02:03:15,110 --> 02:03:17,270
And that dot.
It didn't,

2987
02:03:18,050 --> 02:03:21,830
it's very rarely been the case in the 
history of comedy that everybody kind of

2988
02:03:21,831 --> 02:03:22,664
got along and just accepted the fact 
that everybody does things differently 

2989
02:03:24,621 --> 02:03:25,510
and not make,
not,

2990
02:03:25,910 --> 02:03:27,180
don't make a big deal out of it.
Yeah.

2991
02:03:27,280 --> 02:03:29,110
We'd have to have factions inside of 
our,

2992
02:03:29,480 --> 02:03:31,370
it's one you want to have a safe space 
show.

2993
02:03:31,400 --> 02:03:32,000
I get it.
Yeah.

2994
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:32,833
It's,
people don't want to hear shit like 

2995
02:03:33,531 --> 02:03:34,100
that.
It's okay.

2996
02:03:34,100 --> 02:03:34,940
Have you ever been a show?

2997
02:03:35,030 --> 02:03:37,130
Have Your Black Knight?
That's fine to have everything.

2998
02:03:37,700 --> 02:03:39,280
Everyone's defensive.
Oh my.

2999
02:03:39,320 --> 02:03:43,850
Everyone wants to hold their ground and 
stand up for their position on things.

3000
02:03:43,851 --> 02:03:44,684
It's like,
okay,

3001
02:03:45,130 --> 02:03:46,890
you going to be fine.
Everyone's going to prison or just,

3002
02:03:46,940 --> 02:03:49,940
it's the best time ever.
Just kick ass.

3003
02:03:49,941 --> 02:03:52,190
Just keep writing.
Just go out there and do it.

3004
02:03:52,280 --> 02:03:53,091
Um,
yeah.

3005
02:03:53,091 --> 02:03:55,470
And then it got better.
But a lot of that was it.

3006
02:03:55,490 --> 02:03:57,170
The focus I was able to get because of 
these,

3007
02:03:57,500 --> 02:03:58,760
it was rent.
Uh,

3008
02:03:58,820 --> 02:03:59,653
no,
no,

3009
02:04:01,300 --> 02:04:02,750
not well beach.
I tried Wellbutrin.

3010
02:04:02,780 --> 02:04:06,590
The problem is some of these pills like 
the side effects are not worth it.

3011
02:04:07,850 --> 02:04:11,480
So what I tell people,
like someone had a problem once,

3012
02:04:11,481 --> 02:04:13,640
a fucking anxiety,
um,

3013
02:04:14,010 --> 02:04:14,843
use of,
I don't care about this shit nicky was 

3014
02:04:16,150 --> 02:04:17,230
and um,
and uh,

3015
02:04:17,270 --> 02:04:18,103
he's right now planning on bombing out 
embassy and it was like he didn't want 

3016
02:04:21,651 --> 02:04:23,720
to go on it cause he was afraid it would
make him like a Zombie.

3017
02:04:23,721 --> 02:04:24,201
And I'm like,
okay,

3018
02:04:24,201 --> 02:04:27,380
if it does,
just go back off it so you don't have to

3019
02:04:27,381 --> 02:04:28,700
commit forever.
Right.

3020
02:04:28,730 --> 02:04:30,230
You know what I mean?
Just see what the effects are.

3021
02:04:30,380 --> 02:04:32,720
So on I think Wellbutrin,
uh,

3022
02:04:32,721 --> 02:04:35,490
I couldn't come.
Oh it was fresh and I,

3023
02:04:35,630 --> 02:04:38,060
I wouldn't even say it was any sort of 
psycho periodic

3024
02:04:38,090 --> 02:04:38,923
thing cause I didn't know about that as 
a side effect until that was happening 

3025
02:04:41,280 --> 02:04:43,110
with my girlfriend at the time.
And I was like,

3026
02:04:43,111 --> 02:04:44,570
what the fuck?
I was like three times in a row.

3027
02:04:44,571 --> 02:04:45,690
I was like,
it just couldn't come.

3028
02:04:46,380 --> 02:04:47,101
And then she was like,
oh,

3029
02:04:47,101 --> 02:04:48,180
maybe it's those pills.
I'm like,

3030
02:04:48,300 --> 02:04:49,170
why?
Really?

3031
02:04:49,230 --> 02:04:50,040
And then I looked,
I was like,

3032
02:04:50,040 --> 02:04:52,260
oh yeah,
fucking annoying.

3033
02:04:52,860 --> 02:04:54,870
It's an annoying thing.
That's super annoying.

3034
02:04:55,410 --> 02:05:00,210
There was this one called rem or Ron.
Think about like how many circuits there

3035
02:05:00,211 --> 02:05:03,900
are matching so much in there.
And I'll think of something that gets in

3036
02:05:03,901 --> 02:05:05,370
there and fixes this was like,
Hey,

3037
02:05:05,380 --> 02:05:06,960
I'm going to take that away.
They come thing,

3038
02:05:07,040 --> 02:05:09,420
oh it's like you edit your own computer.
My God.

3039
02:05:09,620 --> 02:05:10,453
Like by taking those,
it's almost like you edit your own 

3040
02:05:12,061 --> 02:05:12,894
opera.
Remember when you have a a pc you can 

3041
02:05:14,281 --> 02:05:16,440
get into dos defragging,
do shit.

3042
02:05:16,460 --> 02:05:19,380
Yeah.
That's almost like what you're doing.

3043
02:05:19,500 --> 02:05:20,333
So the side effect on run run,
these side effects don't hit everybody 

3044
02:05:22,861 --> 02:05:26,280
the same and what you're looking to fill
in isn't all the same.

3045
02:05:26,281 --> 02:05:28,710
So don't just get with somebody else 
gets you got to talk to a therapist.

3046
02:05:28,711 --> 02:05:31,350
But like Rem Ron gave me hyper Phasia 
oh.

3047
02:05:31,710 --> 02:05:32,543
Which is the inability to be feel full.
So they said expect to gain 15% of your 

3048
02:05:37,021 --> 02:05:39,390
body weight.
And I could eat,

3049
02:05:39,780 --> 02:05:41,520
dude,
if I got high,

3050
02:05:41,580 --> 02:05:44,100
I could eat like eight plates of 
Spaghetti.

3051
02:05:44,130 --> 02:05:46,350
I mean,
I would eat out my whole apartment.

3052
02:05:46,530 --> 02:05:47,640
Holy Shit.
Everything.

3053
02:05:47,641 --> 02:05:48,870
It got to the point where I was like,
well,

3054
02:05:48,871 --> 02:05:51,540
I got one big left,
some peanut butter and some a little bit

3055
02:05:51,541 --> 02:05:54,240
of Cheerio's and fucking let's do this.
It was,

3056
02:05:54,290 --> 02:05:56,310
and it was glorious,
but that it wasn't helping me.

3057
02:05:56,311 --> 02:05:57,144
That was a problem.
That was a side effect because I was 

3058
02:05:57,901 --> 02:06:01,560
thin then I could have dealt with,
I can be 15 pounds overweight instead of

3059
02:06:01,561 --> 02:06:03,390
10 pounds underweight,
but like,

3060
02:06:04,020 --> 02:06:05,310
it didn't help me mentally.

3061
02:06:05,730 --> 02:06:08,520
Mm.
Um,

3062
02:06:09,180 --> 02:06:10,800
and then I finally got on one to 
separate me.

3063
02:06:10,810 --> 02:06:12,840
That was like,
it worked.

3064
02:06:13,200 --> 02:06:13,771
I was like,
boom,

3065
02:06:13,771 --> 02:06:14,790
I'm out.
I get it.

3066
02:06:14,940 --> 02:06:17,220
I'm free now a little bit.
Um,

3067
02:06:18,050 --> 02:06:20,430
but low blood pressure.
So sometimes I stayed up,

3068
02:06:20,431 --> 02:06:23,700
I got to hold on to something and like,
it's not fucking faint,

3069
02:06:23,730 --> 02:06:26,310
but barely ever happens.
Totally worth it.

3070
02:06:27,360 --> 02:06:28,710
And that still happens now when I get 
high.

3071
02:06:29,580 --> 02:06:31,320
But like,
do you get like,

3072
02:06:31,380 --> 02:06:32,490
dizzy lightheaded?
Yeah,

3073
02:06:32,491 --> 02:06:33,324
I stand up.
I'm like,

3074
02:06:33,330 --> 02:06:34,163
hold on,
you got to get real high with for that 

3075
02:06:35,311 --> 02:06:37,470
to happen or early or something like 
that.

3076
02:06:37,471 --> 02:06:38,640
Or if I'm getting sick,
that'll happen.

3077
02:06:38,641 --> 02:06:40,170
But I used to get that in high school 
too.

3078
02:06:40,740 --> 02:06:42,810
I think I'm already predisposed to it,
but they made it a little worse.

3079
02:06:42,860 --> 02:06:43,890
Not,
not a big deal though.

3080
02:06:43,891 --> 02:06:45,510
So I finally found the one that worked 
for me,

3081
02:06:45,511 --> 02:06:47,760
but it's hard and if you're not having 
it,

3082
02:06:47,761 --> 02:06:48,594
your brain is lying to you or it's 
giving you a version of reality that's 

3083
02:06:51,661 --> 02:06:55,650
like,
I mean I saw this last night coming home

3084
02:06:55,651 --> 02:06:59,970
from the airport from Burbank airport 
and some lady picked up in an Uber,

3085
02:07:00,150 --> 02:07:02,620
picked up a guy on the wrong side of the
fence and she was,

3086
02:07:02,621 --> 02:07:03,960
sorry it's my first time here.

3087
02:07:03,990 --> 02:07:07,320
But like it's one of those little fences
you can just step over almost,

3088
02:07:07,321 --> 02:07:08,580
you know?
And he's like,

3089
02:07:08,581 --> 02:07:10,480
well everyone else is gone here.
And she's like,

3090
02:07:10,481 --> 02:07:10,921
yeah,
sorry.

3091
02:07:10,921 --> 02:07:11,754
It's my first time at the Burbank 
airport I can and you can't get to walk 

3092
02:07:13,621 --> 02:07:16,100
10 seconds to where it's an opening and 
he's white.

3093
02:07:16,101 --> 02:07:17,730
It's like pop the trunk,
pop the trunk place,

3094
02:07:17,731 --> 02:07:18,331
and I'm like,
Oh,

3095
02:07:18,331 --> 02:07:20,370
you're cranky from flying.
I know what that is.

3096
02:07:20,690 --> 02:07:24,720
And so your version of this reality is 
this is a way worse thing than it really

3097
02:07:24,721 --> 02:07:26,790
is.
Steve Simone who never gets upset,

3098
02:07:26,791 --> 02:07:27,670
which was like,
I know deal,

3099
02:07:27,700 --> 02:07:29,790
I'll just come around and then it's 
over.

3100
02:07:30,300 --> 02:07:31,133
It's the same thing we've talked to 
Fitzsimmons like you can just not punch 

3101
02:07:32,731 --> 02:07:35,290
somebody and then forget about it.
But you know,

3102
02:07:35,291 --> 02:07:36,124
if you're,
if you're thinking that angrily all the 

3103
02:07:37,131 --> 02:07:37,964
time,
it's really affects you and this shit 

3104
02:07:38,831 --> 02:07:40,630
makes you think the worst of everything.

3105
02:07:40,840 --> 02:07:42,460
Wow.
It's like,

3106
02:07:44,590 --> 02:07:45,423
yeah,
no matter what it is so little worse 

3107
02:07:47,470 --> 02:07:51,130
than it should be an interesting way of 
looking at it.

3108
02:07:51,730 --> 02:07:54,340
Yeah.
And it just gets tiring after awhile and

3109
02:07:54,341 --> 02:07:56,530
the suicidal thoughts start happening 
when you're like,

3110
02:07:57,610 --> 02:08:01,210
I can't do this anymore.
You know,

3111
02:08:02,230 --> 02:08:04,690
it's effort.
It's mental effort to just like,

3112
02:08:04,820 --> 02:08:05,710
oh,
it just keeps,

3113
02:08:06,010 --> 02:08:07,800
it's like you've got to rock on you that
you're pulling up,

3114
02:08:07,810 --> 02:08:12,550
pushing off you at all times and you 
just need the game to be over.

3115
02:08:13,030 --> 02:08:16,270
You just need a sleep.
Theo is to have a bit about,

3116
02:08:16,271 --> 02:08:18,190
I think he probably didn't have special 
or something by now,

3117
02:08:18,191 --> 02:08:21,160
but it was like if you want that deep 
sleep,

3118
02:08:21,410 --> 02:08:23,890
deep sleep,
like that's what it is,

3119
02:08:23,891 --> 02:08:24,724
where you just want to sleep forever.
You just weighed down by it all the 

3120
02:08:27,371 --> 02:08:28,181
time.
Yeah.

3121
02:08:28,181 --> 02:08:29,260
It's like,
you know how they used to like,

3122
02:08:29,290 --> 02:08:30,123
um,
get people to give false confessions by 

3123
02:08:32,291 --> 02:08:35,380
just keeping them awake for like 30 
straight hours until they eventually,

3124
02:08:35,390 --> 02:08:36,550
like they don't know how to say no.

3125
02:08:36,550 --> 02:08:38,620
The fine I did it and stuff they did 
didn't do,

3126
02:08:38,650 --> 02:08:40,600
they weren't anywhere near it,
but they're just saying,

3127
02:08:40,601 --> 02:08:41,381
yes,
I murdered somebody,

3128
02:08:41,381 --> 02:08:43,960
let me sleep.
It's just a version of that,

3129
02:08:44,710 --> 02:08:45,940
you know,
where you're just like,

3130
02:08:46,990 --> 02:08:47,823
he's just so sick of it.
After a while I will tell you that they 

3131
02:08:52,490 --> 02:08:56,260
have read about it and they say the 
people who talk about suicide or sort of

3132
02:08:56,261 --> 02:08:57,094
different,
the people who are thinking about it 

3133
02:08:58,391 --> 02:08:59,224
quietly,
who quietly is weight way more often to 

3134
02:09:02,111 --> 02:09:04,140
commit it.
Um,

3135
02:09:04,390 --> 02:09:08,230
I think they say the people talking 
about it as a way to seek help.

3136
02:09:08,590 --> 02:09:09,423
So what can you do it,
the question was what could you do to 

3137
02:09:11,621 --> 02:09:12,454
help people?
Is there anything that anybody could 

3138
02:09:14,261 --> 02:09:15,160
have done?
You know,

3139
02:09:15,220 --> 02:09:17,950
it used to make me mad when you told me 
just get out of bed to some exercise.

3140
02:09:19,110 --> 02:09:20,080
I was like,
you don't get it.

3141
02:09:20,170 --> 02:09:22,690
You don't get it.
I definitely don't get it.

3142
02:09:23,020 --> 02:09:24,610
Yeah.
Shandra understood at once.

3143
02:09:24,611 --> 02:09:27,280
She was like talking about that.
She was like,

3144
02:09:27,790 --> 02:09:29,740
he doesn't understand.
You can't even go to your fridge.

3145
02:09:30,760 --> 02:09:31,593
Like exercise is not even just so far 
from like no way I could couldn't even 

3146
02:09:37,540 --> 02:09:39,940
get out of bed.
What do you think was,

3147
02:09:39,990 --> 02:09:40,823
you were also taking propecia then it 
had anything to do with it because 

3148
02:09:44,591 --> 02:09:46,390
that's one of the site event I'm for 
sure.

3149
02:09:46,391 --> 02:09:47,224
Might have.
I mean it was right around then and I 

3150
02:09:48,641 --> 02:09:49,690
think,
I'm trying to think,

3151
02:09:50,200 --> 02:09:51,033
um,
if I was quitting right then on it and 

3152
02:09:53,080 --> 02:09:56,200
switched into the fucking spread,
um,

3153
02:09:57,060 --> 02:09:58,270
come on.
Stem cell research.

3154
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:02,950
But I think it was either on it or,
or,

3155
02:10:02,980 --> 02:10:04,290
or getting off it.
Yeah,

3156
02:10:04,450 --> 02:10:06,100
for sure.
For sure.

3157
02:10:06,270 --> 02:10:07,360
Could have had something to do with 
that.

3158
02:10:07,420 --> 02:10:08,890
Yeah,
I think so too.

3159
02:10:09,070 --> 02:10:10,680
It was also,
um,

3160
02:10:11,010 --> 02:10:11,843
uh,
live in girl.

3161
02:10:11,890 --> 02:10:12,723
I mean,
there was so many things right around 

3162
02:10:13,241 --> 02:10:14,800
that.
So all it takes is a sprain.

3163
02:10:14,980 --> 02:10:15,813
So like here's a weird thing.
Let's say you lost your job and that 

3164
02:10:18,421 --> 02:10:20,110
sends you into a depression.
It's not,

3165
02:10:20,111 --> 02:10:23,170
that is not related to something.
A lot of times it will be related,

3166
02:10:23,171 --> 02:10:24,820
something a mom dies,
dad dies.

3167
02:10:24,821 --> 02:10:28,180
But let's say the job situation,
because you can change this,

3168
02:10:28,360 --> 02:10:29,380
right?
Your Dad dies,

3169
02:10:29,381 --> 02:10:30,910
you'll never get them back.
You know,

3170
02:10:30,911 --> 02:10:33,530
it feels bad.
And so like it should bad,

3171
02:10:34,250 --> 02:10:36,020
you lose your job,
you go into depression,

3172
02:10:36,260 --> 02:10:38,810
but now you get a better job.
You know what I mean?

3173
02:10:38,840 --> 02:10:39,673
Not that you will,
but let's just say you did the 

3174
02:10:41,031 --> 02:10:42,290
depression remains.

3175
02:10:42,740 --> 02:10:45,860
The causes of depression is necessarily 
gone.

3176
02:10:46,220 --> 02:10:48,740
You're doing better than the thing that 
made you depressed,

3177
02:10:49,700 --> 02:10:51,710
but you're still depressed because that 
brain is sprained.

3178
02:10:51,770 --> 02:10:54,020
Oh,
so you need a way to fight it.

3179
02:10:54,140 --> 02:10:57,530
And pills don't work for everybody.
So it's fucking disheartening.

3180
02:10:57,531 --> 02:10:59,600
And getting the right,
I had a therapist say,

3181
02:11:00,440 --> 02:11:01,100
well,
I was like this,

3182
02:11:01,100 --> 02:11:01,931
this one,
pills not working.

3183
02:11:01,931 --> 02:11:02,330
It's like,
wow,

3184
02:11:02,330 --> 02:11:04,700
I don't know what to tell Ya.
And I was like,

3185
02:11:04,730 --> 02:11:06,200
and in my head I was just like,
okay,

3186
02:11:06,201 --> 02:11:08,540
I accept it all.
Work up the courage eventually,

3187
02:11:08,541 --> 02:11:10,730
and that'll be the end of it.
I was like,

3188
02:11:10,731 --> 02:11:11,720
well,
am I going to fight you on it?

3189
02:11:11,870 --> 02:11:13,310
I don't want to fight this in the first 
place.

3190
02:11:13,311 --> 02:11:15,830
It's not going to work.
How she was the worst,

3191
02:11:16,310 --> 02:11:18,470
what was it like to get pulled out of 
the clouds?

3192
02:11:19,370 --> 02:11:21,260
Like when the pills,
the pills started working,

3193
02:11:21,261 --> 02:11:26,261
working at first it's like you don't 
trust that it's gone.

3194
02:11:27,830 --> 02:11:32,830
It's like right when the hiccups leave,
you still feel like you're the hiccups,

3195
02:11:33,050 --> 02:11:33,883
right?
You know,

3196
02:11:34,310 --> 02:11:39,310
but like a way longer version of that.
And then what happens weird is you start

3197
02:11:40,521 --> 02:11:41,354
to miss it because it became so much of 
your reality and who you were that like 

3198
02:11:46,610 --> 02:11:48,530
it's this thing that's been pulled away 
from you.

3199
02:11:48,531 --> 02:11:50,600
A part of you is gone.
Hmm.

3200
02:11:50,660 --> 02:11:54,350
So it's weird that you're like,
miss this horrible way of being,

3201
02:11:55,030 --> 02:11:55,863
um,
because you had to figure out a way to 

3202
02:11:57,561 --> 02:11:58,394
like make a positive at this.
And you see this a lot in like pc 

3203
02:12:02,481 --> 02:12:03,314
culture,
we start sort of bragging about your 

3204
02:12:05,690 --> 02:12:07,400
victimization that things have happened 
to you,

3205
02:12:07,401 --> 02:12:08,234
but like it's a way to stand out and be 
a special so that you ended up propping 

3206
02:12:11,841 --> 02:12:12,900
the,
the,

3207
02:12:13,580 --> 02:12:16,340
the negative up instead of,
instead of saying,

3208
02:12:16,341 --> 02:12:17,174
yeah,
that was shitty.

3209
02:12:18,380 --> 02:12:19,213
You know,
you started almost like bragging about 

3210
02:12:20,211 --> 02:12:21,044
it,
right?

3211
02:12:21,260 --> 02:12:24,620
So you start feeling like,
well at least I'm different.

3212
02:12:25,220 --> 02:12:26,053
So that can prop you up a little.
At least I'm unique in this thing of 

3213
02:12:28,491 --> 02:12:31,340
like it doesn't seem like anyone else's 
having these suicidal thoughts,

3214
02:12:31,880 --> 02:12:33,700
you know?
Um,

3215
02:12:35,090 --> 02:12:37,010
it's almost like if you're only the only
one to do a band,

3216
02:12:37,130 --> 02:12:39,470
you feel better than if everyone else 
into that same band.

3217
02:12:39,780 --> 02:12:41,180
The band is,
the album is the album.

3218
02:12:41,660 --> 02:12:43,460
But you'd like it more because you're 
the only one,

3219
02:12:43,870 --> 02:12:45,890
right?
The oldest in your own uniqueness.

3220
02:12:45,891 --> 02:12:48,260
It's like maybe it was that,
I'm not really sure,

3221
02:12:48,261 --> 02:12:49,094
but when I was out of it,
that was missing it a little bit and 

3222
02:12:52,551 --> 02:12:55,310
then followed by a fear that it's going 
to come back because regular,

3223
02:12:55,430 --> 02:12:57,110
okay.
That's a terrible word.

3224
02:12:57,111 --> 02:12:59,660
Depression because it also means just,
I'm depressed today.

3225
02:13:00,200 --> 02:13:02,630
Clinical depression is different but 
overlaps,

3226
02:13:03,260 --> 02:13:05,690
you know,
it doesn't just go away if I'm depressed

3227
02:13:05,691 --> 02:13:06,950
because I'm cranky,
I got to tell myself,

3228
02:13:07,190 --> 02:13:08,570
don't be cranky.
Say Five things.

3229
02:13:08,571 --> 02:13:10,400
You're thankful for you.
She'll be out of it.

3230
02:13:10,730 --> 02:13:11,810
Get some sunshine,
you're fine.

3231
02:13:12,020 --> 02:13:16,160
This is like deeper.
So like then when you do get depressed,

3232
02:13:16,161 --> 02:13:18,080
like let's just say I haven't been 
outside all day.

3233
02:13:18,081 --> 02:13:19,970
It's been raining for two straight days,
you know,

3234
02:13:19,971 --> 02:13:23,270
he just a little like blue.
You're like,

3235
02:13:23,300 --> 02:13:24,560
oh fuck,
is it back?

3236
02:13:25,340 --> 02:13:27,500
You know?
And then when it's gone in a day like Oh

3237
02:13:27,680 --> 02:13:28,513
God,
but when it's like two days like fuck 

3238
02:13:30,301 --> 02:13:31,160
fuck,
fuck,

3239
02:13:31,830 --> 02:13:32,663
don't come back.

3240
02:13:33,960 --> 02:13:35,040
Wow.
Yeah.

3241
02:13:35,041 --> 02:13:38,370
But the the so about like a bad weather 
day could set it off a little bit.

3242
02:13:38,880 --> 02:13:39,713
No,
that just gives like the normal 

3243
02:13:40,171 --> 02:13:42,620
depression that everybody gets right at.
That's,

3244
02:13:42,680 --> 02:13:44,610
I think there really should be two 
separate terms.

3245
02:13:44,611 --> 02:13:49,260
Feeling Blue Fail and blue you get it 
hadn't been on stage in four days.

3246
02:13:49,261 --> 02:13:50,740
I feel a little blue if I,
if I,

3247
02:13:51,430 --> 02:13:53,970
I didn't know if I can get my underwear 
out all day too.

3248
02:13:53,971 --> 02:13:55,770
I can't live in Vancouver.
Yeah,

3249
02:13:55,771 --> 02:13:56,610
exactly.
Yeah.

3250
02:13:56,611 --> 02:13:58,710
Those people get depressed.
It don't go outside in Seattle.

3251
02:13:59,040 --> 02:14:01,740
They don't get outside while they get 
outside where they get rained on.

3252
02:14:01,770 --> 02:14:03,990
Yeah.
So it's just like he just feeling down.

3253
02:14:04,290 --> 02:14:05,123
I remember when Duncan and I were 
filming something up there and we were 

3254
02:14:06,601 --> 02:14:07,434
doing that big foot foot and we were 
talking to this guy who was a cop who 

3255
02:14:09,811 --> 02:14:12,540
was like the security guard for the set 
and he was like,

3256
02:14:12,541 --> 02:14:13,980
dude,
it fucking wears on you.

3257
02:14:14,160 --> 02:14:14,993
He was,
he was at the end of like the rainy 

3258
02:14:17,041 --> 02:14:19,290
season.
It was just starting to get warm again.

3259
02:14:20,090 --> 02:14:20,923
The New York,
my first New York went to was this one 

3260
02:14:21,930 --> 02:14:26,220
and it wasn't so much middle of March 
where I was like,

3261
02:14:26,221 --> 02:14:27,210
whatever I could,
I could take it.

3262
02:14:27,211 --> 02:14:28,044
I took the winter,
it was middle of April where I'm like 

3263
02:14:30,630 --> 02:14:33,450
[inaudible] already I put in the three 
or four months.

3264
02:14:33,980 --> 02:14:36,630
Oh,
so the question is the want though.

3265
02:14:36,690 --> 02:14:38,130
What the thing is,
you could do what you want.

3266
02:14:38,131 --> 02:14:39,360
You could leave.
I could leave.

3267
02:14:39,510 --> 02:14:41,610
I went skiing a lot of 16 days of skiing
this year.

3268
02:14:41,860 --> 02:14:44,880
When did that around like road dates.
That's what's crazy about like somewhere

3269
02:14:44,881 --> 02:14:46,830
like denver,
like it's sunny,

3270
02:14:46,980 --> 02:14:47,850
sunny.
It's great.

3271
02:14:47,880 --> 02:14:49,230
It's great.
So much better.

3272
02:14:49,231 --> 02:14:50,460
When it's sunny,
it's cold out,

3273
02:14:50,461 --> 02:14:51,630
but it's still,
it's sunny.

3274
02:14:52,470 --> 02:14:57,180
Like if you have to pick warm and cloudy
all the time or cold and sunny.

3275
02:14:57,180 --> 02:14:59,200
I take cold and sunny all day long.
Yeah,

3276
02:14:59,220 --> 02:15:00,570
for sure.
All Day long.

3277
02:15:00,820 --> 02:15:01,590
Sunny.
Sunny?

3278
02:15:01,590 --> 02:15:02,423
Yeah.
Skiing outside of the sun when it's 

3279
02:15:03,481 --> 02:15:04,180
like,
Oh,

3280
02:15:04,180 --> 02:15:05,640
it's 25 degrees,
but it's just,

3281
02:15:05,641 --> 02:15:07,200
you don't even walking around.
Yeah,

3282
02:15:07,201 --> 02:15:11,130
it's brisk out,
but look how pretty the sky is blue,

3283
02:15:11,280 --> 02:15:12,113
blue sky and fluffy clouds.
Did you know Anthony Bordain was was 

3284
02:15:15,331 --> 02:15:16,440
depressed?
No.

3285
02:15:16,560 --> 02:15:19,800
I heard with him a little.
It was a mixture of mixing drugs,

3286
02:15:20,490 --> 02:15:22,980
mixing pills and alcohol could have the 
hammer.

3287
02:15:23,040 --> 02:15:25,680
I bow,
I believe he was on some sort of malaria

3288
02:15:25,681 --> 02:15:26,514
medication,
which is dangerous if some people 

3289
02:15:29,910 --> 02:15:30,743
violent people get violent.
I've seen people on malaria medication 

3290
02:15:33,841 --> 02:15:34,674
while they were drinking.
And I had a hold the guy back from 

3291
02:15:36,871 --> 02:15:40,920
attacking or the quarter or at least 
worried about him attacking a report.

3292
02:15:41,750 --> 02:15:42,583
It was a friend of mine.
It was a very kind friend of mine who I 

3293
02:15:44,521 --> 02:15:45,354
will,
I don't think we'd ever in normal life 

3294
02:15:48,900 --> 02:15:50,250
attack a person physically.

3295
02:15:50,700 --> 02:15:53,700
And it seemed like he was about to text.
It makes you think not even normal.

3296
02:15:53,730 --> 02:15:55,220
He was squirrely.
Um,

3297
02:15:55,290 --> 02:15:57,180
it was,
he had to go to Africa for,

3298
02:15:57,220 --> 02:15:57,540
he had,
uh,

3299
02:15:57,540 --> 02:15:58,373
he had um,
visit somewhere in Africa and he had to 

3300
02:16:00,541 --> 02:16:05,040
take these pills and some of them have 
violent reactions to people.

3301
02:16:05,100 --> 02:16:06,630
You're not supposed to drink on them,
first of all.

3302
02:16:06,750 --> 02:16:08,160
And he was drinking.
It's mixing.

3303
02:16:08,190 --> 02:16:09,990
Yeah.
And you know,

3304
02:16:10,380 --> 02:16:13,230
if that's what he was doing and he's 
mixing that with alcohol,

3305
02:16:13,231 --> 02:16:14,064
who fucking knows.
So that could have happened with board 

3306
02:16:15,471 --> 02:16:16,304
and where,
it might not have been long term 

3307
02:16:16,771 --> 02:16:19,610
depression,
but I know there's studies on people who

3308
02:16:19,620 --> 02:16:22,590
got a concussion in football practice 
and then hung themselves at night.

3309
02:16:22,680 --> 02:16:24,030
Oh yeah.
No history of it.

3310
02:16:24,360 --> 02:16:25,193
But right then everything,
I mean it's almost like you're on 

3311
02:16:26,791 --> 02:16:29,560
psychedelics.
This new reality is real.

3312
02:16:29,890 --> 02:16:30,723
It feels real.

3313
02:16:32,740 --> 02:16:34,870
So the question is,
is there something you could've done?

3314
02:16:35,860 --> 02:16:38,160
I don't know.
I don't know what the right,

3315
02:16:38,170 --> 02:16:39,850
I've thought about it.
I don't know what the right thing is.

3316
02:16:39,851 --> 02:16:41,740
Cause you,
you push away people's help.

3317
02:16:41,920 --> 02:16:42,753
Right?
I saw somebody posted on facebook once 

3318
02:16:45,640 --> 02:16:46,473
where it was like one of the worst 
things about depression is everybody 

3319
02:16:47,831 --> 02:16:49,120
going to key.
I've been through that too.

3320
02:16:49,121 --> 02:16:52,860
It's like now I'm not even unique,
you know,

3321
02:16:55,430 --> 02:16:57,700
getting by props for my individual 
substance.

3322
02:16:57,720 --> 02:16:59,490
So then it's like you want to help by 
somebody saying you,

3323
02:16:59,500 --> 02:17:00,520
I've been through this,
but it's like,

3324
02:17:00,521 --> 02:17:05,200
it's not even helping them,
but like who the fuck knows what they're

3325
02:17:05,201 --> 02:17:06,100
feeling?
Right.

3326
02:17:06,101 --> 02:17:08,530
That's the other thing about a person's 
feelings,

3327
02:17:08,560 --> 02:17:10,210
what they're feeling.
It's very personal.

3328
02:17:10,270 --> 02:17:12,700
It's almost impossible to describe.
Oh,

3329
02:17:12,701 --> 02:17:15,070
by the way,
I had moderate depression.

3330
02:17:16,150 --> 02:17:18,910
That's where the therapist said what you
saw was moderate depression.

3331
02:17:19,090 --> 02:17:19,923
Jesus,
I don't know what severe depression 

3332
02:17:21,191 --> 02:17:22,960
looks like.
Jesus.

3333
02:17:23,650 --> 02:17:24,700
So I don't know,
man.

3334
02:17:24,701 --> 02:17:26,080
I don't know.
I lost somebody to,

3335
02:17:26,081 --> 02:17:29,740
and I don't know if I could have said 
something to her or like,

3336
02:17:30,520 --> 02:17:31,353
you know,
um,

3337
02:17:31,630 --> 02:17:33,730
anthony like to drink.
He drank a lot.

3338
02:17:33,790 --> 02:17:34,630
Yeah.
And uh,

3339
02:17:34,810 --> 02:17:39,410
watching him over the last four years,
like you could see that he's,

3340
02:17:39,760 --> 02:17:42,910
he'd seemed like he had been living a 
hard life.

3341
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:46,240
You know,
he looked like it on television too.

3342
02:17:46,300 --> 02:17:48,670
You've been living a hard life.
I mean,

3343
02:17:48,671 --> 02:17:52,450
he was out there hitting it,
traveling from country to country,

3344
02:17:52,451 --> 02:17:56,140
constantly drinking constantly.
Alcohol's a depressant.

3345
02:17:56,280 --> 02:17:58,780
I mean it just is,
if you drink alcohol all the time,

3346
02:17:58,781 --> 02:18:01,330
you're not going to come out of it with 
a sunny disposition as the president.

3347
02:18:01,390 --> 02:18:02,410
It is a depressant.
I mean,

3348
02:18:02,411 --> 02:18:04,210
you can definitely do it and pull it 
off.

3349
02:18:04,211 --> 02:18:05,380
And we do.

3350
02:18:05,530 --> 02:18:06,363
And you know,
occasionally you'll have a couple of 

3351
02:18:07,211 --> 02:18:10,540
drinks and then the next day you won't.
But if you're doing that all the time,

3352
02:18:11,230 --> 02:18:13,870
if you doing it every day,
five days a week,

3353
02:18:13,900 --> 02:18:17,380
a lot of people use that because it's a 
short term relief from depression,

3354
02:18:17,381 --> 02:18:18,214
longterm depressant.
So a lot of people use alcoholism to 

3355
02:18:20,321 --> 02:18:22,150
cover up the depression and then they 
get clean.

3356
02:18:22,180 --> 02:18:23,013
Suddenly all the shit they're supposed 
to have been dealing with is now still 

3357
02:18:24,791 --> 02:18:26,650
there and not being covered up by 
alcohol.

3358
02:18:27,240 --> 02:18:29,100
Yeah.
Yeah.

3359
02:18:29,580 --> 02:18:31,610
Fun that comes with a couple of drinks.
The,

3360
02:18:31,720 --> 02:18:32,860
there's a fuck.
Absolutely.

3361
02:18:32,861 --> 02:18:33,700
It's fun.
Fuck it.

3362
02:18:33,701 --> 02:18:34,890
Let's stop worrying.
Yeah.

3363
02:18:34,900 --> 02:18:36,580
It spends how addicted to,
I can't,

3364
02:18:36,670 --> 02:18:38,530
I wish I could do that with cigarettes 
when everybody's smoking,

3365
02:18:38,650 --> 02:18:40,680
but I'll go right back to a pack.
So do you do,

3366
02:18:40,810 --> 02:18:44,170
do you,
do you think like fuck,

3367
02:18:44,171 --> 02:18:45,004
what could I have done?

3368
02:18:45,280 --> 02:18:46,113
No,
cause I wasn't close enough to them and 

3369
02:18:47,341 --> 02:18:49,240
I wasn't there.
If I was there,

3370
02:18:49,241 --> 02:18:51,390
I would be tortured by it.
Yeah.

3371
02:18:51,520 --> 02:18:56,250
If I was there and I was hanging out 
with them and it happened in [inaudible]

3372
02:18:56,390 --> 02:18:58,450
you tomorrow and then I would have been 
tortured by that,

3373
02:18:58,750 --> 02:19:02,110
that would then with anybody,
you know,

3374
02:19:03,600 --> 02:19:08,600
it's just such a crazy decision to make 
the decision to just stop living when so

3375
02:19:10,031 --> 02:19:12,460
many people loved you and you have this 
crazy life that,

3376
02:19:12,461 --> 02:19:14,590
uh,
it's the bravest thing to me.

3377
02:19:14,910 --> 02:19:16,600
Yeah.
I can't imagine it's,

3378
02:19:16,610 --> 02:19:17,443
it's,
that's the only thing that held me back 

3379
02:19:18,311 --> 02:19:21,100
is just the lack of courage to be like,
just do it.

3380
02:19:21,130 --> 02:19:22,070
And it's like,
let it stop.

3381
02:19:22,090 --> 02:19:24,910
Your DNA is telling you,
but stop and think about you.

3382
02:19:24,911 --> 02:19:28,310
What you've from not doing that you 
become wildly successful.

3383
02:19:29,190 --> 02:19:30,530
Yeah.
And way happier.

3384
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:33,000
You're having a great fucking time at a 
great time.

3385
02:19:33,060 --> 02:19:34,880
It,
I have the architect of my own happiness

3386
02:19:34,940 --> 02:19:38,540
and his fucking,
I'm doing it well while I'm doing myself

3387
02:19:38,541 --> 02:19:40,010
doing it the way you're supposed to do 
it,

3388
02:19:40,160 --> 02:19:41,720
but you're,
you know,

3389
02:19:41,721 --> 02:19:44,660
you've been doing it like this for 
several years now and if you,

3390
02:19:44,990 --> 02:19:46,610
I guess it really doesn't matter in the 
end,

3391
02:19:47,050 --> 02:19:47,883
but if you end your own life,
you didn't ever experienced all this 

3392
02:19:50,960 --> 02:19:51,793
true.
But if you had to go back and do it 

3393
02:19:53,091 --> 02:19:54,050
again,
it's interesting.

3394
02:19:54,051 --> 02:19:55,440
You were at like a tipping point,
Matt,

3395
02:19:55,520 --> 02:19:59,330
you're this like weird tipping point and
you just went that way and you're free.

3396
02:20:00,080 --> 02:20:02,270
Just took a while.
It was definitely a struggle.

3397
02:20:02,300 --> 02:20:03,133
But you,
you were free I find when talking to 

3398
02:20:05,361 --> 02:20:08,750
comics,
other comics because now I feel a little

3399
02:20:08,751 --> 02:20:09,770
guilty,
you know,

3400
02:20:10,040 --> 02:20:13,880
for success around around people that 
are also quite funny who don't have it.

3401
02:20:14,480 --> 02:20:15,313
And what I found is that it's,
you get this frustrating point right 

3402
02:20:18,081 --> 02:20:18,741
around eight,
nine,

3403
02:20:18,741 --> 02:20:19,574
10 12 years of comedy where like your 
skills have gotten better and your 

3404
02:20:23,780 --> 02:20:26,030
monetary career has not gotten better.

3405
02:20:26,300 --> 02:20:29,090
Seo,
artistic careers booming and then you're

3406
02:20:29,091 --> 02:20:31,580
just not even making a living.
And it's the most frustrating cause like

3407
02:20:31,581 --> 02:20:33,970
I'm finally good at open mic level.
Like,

3408
02:20:33,971 --> 02:20:35,940
or make a good joke that's a window and 
so on.

3409
02:20:36,410 --> 02:20:40,190
I made a good joke tonight,
this week or one time this month,

3410
02:20:40,250 --> 02:20:41,870
you know,
but like they are,

3411
02:20:41,871 --> 02:20:43,910
it's like I'm doing so well on stage,
I'm killing,

3412
02:20:43,911 --> 02:20:46,550
why am I,
why am I still working this day job?

3413
02:20:46,551 --> 02:20:48,470
Why am I not even ever on TV?
Why am I,

3414
02:20:48,471 --> 02:20:50,210
you know?
And it's real frustrating.

3415
02:20:50,570 --> 02:20:52,970
Might've been around that time too or 
just getting frustrated with like,

3416
02:20:53,540 --> 02:20:54,373
you know,
I was less hacky but also just not 

3417
02:20:56,061 --> 02:20:56,894
succeeding.
I say an interesting how the Internet's 

3418
02:20:59,960 --> 02:21:04,700
changed everything or for,
you can support people so much easier.

3419
02:21:04,730 --> 02:21:09,730
Before it was like you had the man show 
you could hire a writer and that's it.

3420
02:21:11,150 --> 02:21:12,560
That's the only help you could do for 
someone.

3421
02:21:12,590 --> 02:21:13,790
Yeah.
You know,

3422
02:21:13,850 --> 02:21:15,740
take a couple people on the road with 
you,

3423
02:21:16,610 --> 02:21:17,750
but now it's like,
Hey,

3424
02:21:17,780 --> 02:21:19,220
go watch this guy show,
hey,

3425
02:21:19,221 --> 02:21:20,420
this guy's got under special.
Hey,

3426
02:21:20,421 --> 02:21:22,880
check out so and so's got a new book,
you know,

3427
02:21:23,030 --> 02:21:23,960
changes everything.
Yeah.

3428
02:21:24,560 --> 02:21:27,620
And people are going and it's literally 
no skin off your back.

3429
02:21:27,650 --> 02:21:28,670
Yeah.
It's like whatever.

3430
02:21:28,700 --> 02:21:30,080
Well,
it's great actually.

3431
02:21:30,081 --> 02:21:31,100
It's good.
Like I,

3432
02:21:31,101 --> 02:21:33,980
if Tom Papa asked me to promote 
something he's doing,

3433
02:21:33,981 --> 02:21:35,600
I want people to go see him.
It's good.

3434
02:21:35,870 --> 02:21:36,703
It's good for me.
I want them to do good because I like 

3435
02:21:39,291 --> 02:21:40,730
listening to him.
I like watching them,

3436
02:21:40,731 --> 02:21:43,670
so I want them to make more comedy.
Oh yeah.

3437
02:21:43,671 --> 02:21:45,020
Then you went,
because I get to see you more.

3438
02:21:45,021 --> 02:21:47,750
I got to get to sell out.
Comedy person gets to stay in it.

3439
02:21:47,870 --> 02:21:50,210
Not that he needs us,
but it also will,

3440
02:21:50,220 --> 02:21:54,120
like with Tom,
when you tell people about someone who's

3441
02:21:54,150 --> 02:21:56,060
really funny,
whether it's you or whoever it is,

3442
02:21:56,720 --> 02:21:57,860
then they trust you.

3443
02:21:57,920 --> 02:21:58,970
They'll go,
I want to see that guy.

3444
02:21:58,971 --> 02:22:02,120
He's a fucking Lexia.
They know that you're telling the truth.

3445
02:22:02,121 --> 02:22:04,140
Like if I tell him,
Hey Joey Diaz,

3446
02:22:04,160 --> 02:22:04,993
the funniest guy that's ever lived and 
you go see him at the Ice House one 

3447
02:22:07,311 --> 02:22:09,530
night and come out of it and you,
you're bleeding,

3448
02:22:10,030 --> 02:22:12,920
your,
your internal bruising for laughing.

3449
02:22:13,190 --> 02:22:15,170
I love guaranteeing people on twitter or
whatever.

3450
02:22:15,171 --> 02:22:15,920
It's like,
you don't know.

3451
02:22:15,920 --> 02:22:16,753
I guarantee you will have a great night.
This is someone who has an awesome 

3452
02:22:19,401 --> 02:22:20,234
comic.
Just,

3453
02:22:20,390 --> 02:22:21,680
just,
there's no like,

3454
02:22:21,710 --> 02:22:22,880
well my friend,
it's like just,

3455
02:22:22,910 --> 02:22:24,530
they'll be great.
There's,

3456
02:22:24,560 --> 02:22:25,830
there's people that you could do that 
with.

3457
02:22:25,831 --> 02:22:27,180
But yeah,
there was no,

3458
02:22:27,210 --> 02:22:28,043
you know,
before it was like you got on the 

3459
02:22:28,591 --> 02:22:29,970
tonight show,
you know,

3460
02:22:29,971 --> 02:22:33,330
he did say that was an actual times that
a letterman people talked about.

3461
02:22:33,331 --> 02:22:34,164
You had to build up places,
you had to travel to places all the 

3462
02:22:36,241 --> 02:22:36,540
time.

3463
02:22:36,540 --> 02:22:39,090
So those people would come back every 
time they came back.

3464
02:22:39,091 --> 02:22:42,270
You better have some new shit to it.
I really got to think about it.

3465
02:22:42,670 --> 02:22:45,600
I have like when you start saying that 
depression of people,

3466
02:22:45,601 --> 02:22:48,210
like what can you do?
Anybody do?

3467
02:22:48,600 --> 02:22:49,433
Is there anything anybody can do?
It's like just a little bit like being 

3468
02:22:52,021 --> 02:22:56,730
there for you sometimes is like helpful.
Just be like,

3469
02:22:57,060 --> 02:22:58,560
hey man,
you're just your good friend.

3470
02:22:58,561 --> 02:22:59,394
I know you're going through something,
but just know that I like you just like 

3471
02:23:01,111 --> 02:23:03,030
a little bit and don't require anything 
of them.

3472
02:23:03,780 --> 02:23:05,880
But I guess everybody be different too.
But like,

3473
02:23:07,590 --> 02:23:09,540
I don't know,
don't know.

3474
02:23:09,840 --> 02:23:11,640
Everybody's on a different trip.
That's the thing.

3475
02:23:11,641 --> 02:23:13,940
It's like no one knows what anyone is 
feeling.

3476
02:23:13,950 --> 02:23:15,870
Telling somebody to get over it is not 
the way to do it.

3477
02:23:16,590 --> 02:23:17,730
That's,
that ain't gonna help.

3478
02:23:18,990 --> 02:23:21,060
The tough love thing is like that.

3479
02:23:21,300 --> 02:23:23,820
It doesn't work.
That works for fucking nothing.

3480
02:23:23,850 --> 02:23:26,760
I don't know what it works for,
but not that it works for lazy people.

3481
02:23:26,780 --> 02:23:28,320
Yeah.
I don't think it works for them.

3482
02:23:28,710 --> 02:23:29,543
I don't even think it works for them.
I think that gets people to move 

3483
02:23:32,101 --> 02:23:33,960
sometimes,
but it doesn't change the way they think

3484
02:23:33,961 --> 02:23:35,830
about what they're doing.
They just get forced into doing,

3485
02:23:36,400 --> 02:23:37,830
you know,
it's like the argument,

3486
02:23:38,550 --> 02:23:41,340
well actually not like that when I was 
going to say,

3487
02:23:42,270 --> 02:23:44,160
but it's,
it's you.

3488
02:23:44,161 --> 02:23:48,060
You want them to act and so they act 
because of force of your your will.

3489
02:23:48,380 --> 02:23:50,480
You're trying to scare them into it.
Yeah,

3490
02:23:50,520 --> 02:23:52,770
but if you inspire someone and say to 
him,

3491
02:23:52,771 --> 02:23:54,630
listen,
I know you're looking at it this way.

3492
02:23:54,980 --> 02:23:57,930
This is why this is going to hurt you by
approaching it this way.

3493
02:23:57,960 --> 02:23:58,793
You're going to do the same thing.
But instead of approaching it the way 

3494
02:24:00,601 --> 02:24:01,830
you're approaching it,
stop.

3495
02:24:02,010 --> 02:24:04,890
And just for a shifted perspective,
think about it in a positive way.

3496
02:24:04,891 --> 02:24:07,680
Like you could do that to people and 
sometimes you can actually shift the way

3497
02:24:07,681 --> 02:24:08,514
they look at something because a lot of 
times it's the way you're approaching 

3498
02:24:10,201 --> 02:24:11,670
something that's pissing you off about 
it.

3499
02:24:12,060 --> 02:24:12,893
And the way to get through sometimes to 
people is not to tell them this is the 

3500
02:24:15,151 --> 02:24:15,984
way you should do it.
But just to paint the picture and let 

3501
02:24:17,911 --> 02:24:19,390
them make their own decision.
Yeah.

3502
02:24:19,590 --> 02:24:20,301
To be like,
Oh sir,

3503
02:24:20,301 --> 02:24:21,840
you're happy when you're run.
Yeah.

3504
02:24:22,050 --> 02:24:22,883
Okay.
Is it,

3505
02:24:23,070 --> 02:24:24,060
is it warm out?
Oh,

3506
02:24:24,061 --> 02:24:24,894
it is.
Okay.

3507
02:24:25,170 --> 02:24:25,971
I don't know.
You're less happening.

3508
02:24:25,971 --> 02:24:27,090
You don't run.
All right.

3509
02:24:27,170 --> 02:24:30,270
Well was like,
instead of be like,

3510
02:24:30,271 --> 02:24:31,800
you got to get out there and run.
I,

3511
02:24:31,801 --> 02:24:34,230
you know,
I have kids raising kids.

3512
02:24:34,231 --> 02:24:35,064
One of the things that I learned that 
works really good is anytime they do 

3513
02:24:37,771 --> 02:24:38,604
anything,
I tell them I fucked up way worse than 

3514
02:24:39,961 --> 02:24:40,170
you.

3515
02:24:40,170 --> 02:24:41,310
I don't use word fucked.
All right?

3516
02:24:41,610 --> 02:24:43,500
And I said,
whatever you've done,

3517
02:24:43,590 --> 02:24:46,900
I've messed up way more like I,
everybody messes up.

3518
02:24:47,610 --> 02:24:48,443
Don't worry about it.
This is a part of being a kid and I'm 

3519
02:24:50,580 --> 02:24:54,090
super proud of you for admitting that 
you made a mistake or that you did this.

3520
02:24:54,091 --> 02:24:55,860
This is great because this is how you 
learn.

3521
02:24:55,861 --> 02:24:56,694
You're not supposed to know everything.
You're eight years old or you're 10 

3522
02:24:58,501 --> 02:25:01,530
years old.
You're supposed to be learning,

3523
02:25:01,590 --> 02:25:02,423
learning about life and people who are 
supposed to be talking to you about 

3524
02:25:04,591 --> 02:25:05,424
various things you encounter.
You don't supposed to already know 

3525
02:25:06,961 --> 02:25:07,980
everything.
You're a little kid.

3526
02:25:08,040 --> 02:25:08,873
This is great.
So we learned something that we don't 

3527
02:25:10,051 --> 02:25:11,460
want to do anymore.
This is great.

3528
02:25:11,490 --> 02:25:13,680
This is an awesome opportunity.
And nobody,

3529
02:25:13,681 --> 02:25:16,560
I wish somebody talked to me like that 
and I will tell them that too.

3530
02:25:16,561 --> 02:25:19,830
I go cause I get called stupid and 
yelled at or whatever.

3531
02:25:19,831 --> 02:25:21,180
Whatever the fuck it was when I did 
something.

3532
02:25:21,181 --> 02:25:23,200
This is how people talk to kids back 
then they didn't,

3533
02:25:23,230 --> 02:25:24,063
you know,
it's not

3534
02:25:24,070 --> 02:25:26,470
even anybody's fault.
So does something dumb.

3535
02:25:26,700 --> 02:25:28,690
You know,
in the 1960s or something like that.

3536
02:25:28,691 --> 02:25:30,250
They threw things at them.
You know,

3537
02:25:30,251 --> 02:25:31,084
like my,
my parents were telling me about things 

3538
02:25:31,931 --> 02:25:34,130
flying across the room at them.
You know,

3539
02:25:34,230 --> 02:25:36,490
like people might stop,
they just fucking that little,

3540
02:25:36,610 --> 02:25:39,010
the kids were animals back then too.
You know,

3541
02:25:39,580 --> 02:25:42,630
people are different.
Yeah.

3542
02:25:42,720 --> 02:25:43,553
Yeah.
So I might be that like something that 

3543
02:25:45,700 --> 02:25:47,380
helped me,
I don't know if people are listening are

3544
02:25:47,400 --> 02:25:49,420
going through it or whatever,
but like some things that will help that

3545
02:25:49,421 --> 02:25:53,350
I was able to take was I had one 
therapist said one good thing where it's

3546
02:25:53,351 --> 02:25:56,050
like imagine the good things out of the 
depression.

3547
02:25:56,320 --> 02:25:57,153
Yeah.
Instead of looking at it as only 

3548
02:25:57,761 --> 02:25:59,360
negative,
um,

3549
02:25:59,740 --> 02:26:01,420
what's it helped you with?
And then I was like,

3550
02:26:01,450 --> 02:26:02,470
well I'm,
it'll try that.

3551
02:26:02,471 --> 02:26:03,304
And I was like,
I'm looking at my standup material more 

3552
02:26:04,901 --> 02:26:09,220
realistically and darker and that's 
actually helpful on stage.

3553
02:26:10,090 --> 02:26:10,541
He was like,
all right,

3554
02:26:10,541 --> 02:26:11,950
cool.
That's one good thing out of this.

3555
02:26:12,070 --> 02:26:15,310
And then it just like sort of,
it might just help you like it's not all

3556
02:26:15,311 --> 02:26:17,290
bad.
Adjust the way you approach it.

3557
02:26:17,350 --> 02:26:18,183
Yeah.
Another thing was say five things and 

3558
02:26:20,021 --> 02:26:22,300
just in the shower,
whenever you do shower,

3559
02:26:22,660 --> 02:26:23,493
say five things out loud that you're 
thankful for doesn't have to be 

3560
02:26:26,921 --> 02:26:29,710
monumental stuff.
Just like it's 75 today.

3561
02:26:29,740 --> 02:26:31,000
That's good.
Um,

3562
02:26:31,420 --> 02:26:33,550
I got a new bar soap.
That's cool.

3563
02:26:34,150 --> 02:26:35,790
Um,
uh,

3564
02:26:35,890 --> 02:26:37,000
my friend John,
you know,

3565
02:26:37,001 --> 02:26:38,050
whatever,
Brian,

3566
02:26:38,080 --> 02:26:39,190
I like him.
That's cool.

3567
02:26:39,360 --> 02:26:40,193
Glad to have that in my life.
Just five things to say it out loud and 

3568
02:26:41,801 --> 02:26:44,770
then after a while sometimes that that 
that ended up like affecting my mood,

3569
02:26:46,180 --> 02:26:47,440
you know,
where instead of,

3570
02:26:47,560 --> 02:26:48,880
cause that was the problem was the 
focus.

3571
02:26:49,720 --> 02:26:51,690
I don't know if I ever told you this 
focus on negative things.

3572
02:26:51,730 --> 02:26:53,350
Yeah,
so it'd be like a 75 degree day.

3573
02:26:53,351 --> 02:26:55,900
This is the example I use 75 degrees and
sunny.

3574
02:26:56,240 --> 02:26:58,420
It's fucking every day in La,
you know?

3575
02:26:59,740 --> 02:27:00,573
And I would be like,
instead of going like this is fucking 

3576
02:27:01,721 --> 02:27:02,554
Rad,
it's February 12th and I am fucking in 

3577
02:27:05,441 --> 02:27:06,580
shorts,
this is great.

3578
02:27:06,880 --> 02:27:09,020
Instead of focusing in that,
I would focus on like fuck,

3579
02:27:09,021 --> 02:27:11,110
I got,
I got my car has no gas,

3580
02:27:11,111 --> 02:27:14,410
I got to fucking go kick gas.
I hate having to fucking get gas.

3581
02:27:14,411 --> 02:27:15,244
You got to pull over.
And so then I'm only focusing on this 

3582
02:27:16,871 --> 02:27:17,704
fucking one minute chore,
but I have to do instead of on all the 

3583
02:27:22,031 --> 02:27:24,250
good stuff.
And so you just focus,

3584
02:27:24,280 --> 02:27:27,640
it just makes you focus on this negative
and he's just like can't pull out of it.

3585
02:27:27,641 --> 02:27:32,641
So anything you can do to like shift the
focus to the positive is helpful.

3586
02:27:33,730 --> 02:27:36,930
Do you know Tony Vee is standup comics 
and bosses?

3587
02:27:38,130 --> 02:27:39,130
I'm a part of them.
Very,

3588
02:27:39,230 --> 02:27:40,063
very funny guy.

3589
02:27:42,070 --> 02:27:42,903
Said something to me once about,
he was driving from New York to Boston 

3590
02:27:45,671 --> 02:27:48,040
back and forth like multiple times in a 
week.

3591
02:27:49,120 --> 02:27:49,811
I go,
dude,

3592
02:27:49,811 --> 02:27:51,850
that's long.
That's a long ass drive.

3593
02:27:52,180 --> 02:27:52,721
And he goes,
yeah,

3594
02:27:52,721 --> 02:27:54,760
but I just go zen and I just tell 
myself,

3595
02:27:54,761 --> 02:27:56,170
this is what I'm doing right now.
Right.

3596
02:27:56,171 --> 02:27:57,190
I just do it.
Yeah.

3597
02:27:57,510 --> 02:27:58,870
But I thought about that and I go,
yeah,

3598
02:27:58,871 --> 02:27:59,704
why don't you just do that?
Just say this is what I'm doing right 

3599
02:28:01,331 --> 02:28:04,260
now instead of like going fuck,
can't believe to drive this thing.

3600
02:28:04,261 --> 02:28:05,720
Yeah.
So fucking long.

3601
02:28:05,800 --> 02:28:06,633
What if I fall asleep?
How do you make yourself think about it 

3602
02:28:08,410 --> 02:28:09,910
positively.
Fucking hard.

3603
02:28:10,030 --> 02:28:11,830
Somebody,
when I told all my norm,

3604
02:28:11,970 --> 02:28:14,410
norm core people about like start doing 
commercials and then they're like,

3605
02:28:14,500 --> 02:28:15,470
how does it work?
And I'm like,

3606
02:28:15,471 --> 02:28:17,200
can you give an agent given 10% like,
well,

3607
02:28:17,890 --> 02:28:20,380
he doesn't go to the auditions,
don't you hate giving a 10% you know,

3608
02:28:20,510 --> 02:28:22,190
and you probably this too from people.

3609
02:28:22,430 --> 02:28:23,990
And you're like,
no,

3610
02:28:23,991 --> 02:28:25,430
I mean,
I remember thinking like that.

3611
02:28:25,431 --> 02:28:27,560
It's like I wouldn't get the auditions 
without them.

3612
02:28:27,870 --> 02:28:29,630
That is nothing compared to what he 
does.

3613
02:28:29,930 --> 02:28:33,110
You want a bunch of people,
there's people don't understand.

3614
02:28:33,230 --> 02:28:35,060
So it's like don't focus on that 
negative shit.

3615
02:28:35,061 --> 02:28:38,150
Focusing on the 90% like I wasn't even a
thing like 20 feet sounds like.

3616
02:28:38,151 --> 02:28:40,130
What's not even thinking like,
oh this is such a sucky thing.

3617
02:28:40,310 --> 02:28:41,870
Well he just had a great way of 
approaching it.

3618
02:28:41,871 --> 02:28:43,370
Yeah,
this is what I'm doing right now.

3619
02:28:43,400 --> 02:28:45,500
So this is what I'm doing.
If you can emulate those people,

3620
02:28:45,501 --> 02:28:46,430
it's hard to move.
It's hard.

3621
02:28:46,431 --> 02:28:47,264
Light them.
Then it's like help you move the needle 

3622
02:28:49,251 --> 02:28:51,020
a little bit.
You know?

3623
02:28:51,140 --> 02:28:53,600
So maybe that one day you're like,
fuck it,

3624
02:28:53,601 --> 02:28:55,880
this is the,
the boulders too hard today.

3625
02:28:56,440 --> 02:28:59,270
Maybe if you got like one nicer thing 
and you're like,

3626
02:28:59,290 --> 02:29:00,200
ah,
I can withstand it.

3627
02:29:00,200 --> 02:29:01,670
And that was the day you were going to 
commit suicide.

3628
02:29:01,671 --> 02:29:05,780
Maybe it'll just like last you through.
This is a culture of,

3629
02:29:05,781 --> 02:29:06,620
uh,
uh,

3630
02:29:06,890 --> 02:29:07,723
attacking and trying to destroy people 
today that didn't exist before and that 

3631
02:29:11,001 --> 02:29:12,070
can affect your mood.
Yeah.

3632
02:29:12,590 --> 02:29:14,900
I think we're seeing that with,
uh,

3633
02:29:15,260 --> 02:29:17,160
people in the news and when people do,
like,

3634
02:29:17,690 --> 02:29:20,990
the thing about that lady,
and I'm the little kid,

3635
02:29:20,991 --> 02:29:22,760
the little eight year old,
she's calling the cops on him.

3636
02:29:23,310 --> 02:29:26,180
The thing that bummed me out the most is
that they didn't accept her apology.

3637
02:29:26,360 --> 02:29:26,760
Yeah.
It's like,

3638
02:29:26,760 --> 02:29:27,380
c'mon,
c'mon.

3639
02:29:27,380 --> 02:29:28,290
That's the thing that brought me,
I'll send,

3640
02:29:28,291 --> 02:29:30,560
I'll start.
What she did was gross for sure,

3641
02:29:30,950 --> 02:29:33,740
but we want people to just suffer 
forever.

3642
02:29:33,800 --> 02:29:34,633
Like the pain that lady must've felt 
from all those thousands of emails and 

3643
02:29:37,881 --> 02:29:41,050
hate tweets she got from ratting out 
that little kid that,

3644
02:29:41,370 --> 02:29:43,120
no,
you don't have to pile on it.

3645
02:29:43,180 --> 02:29:44,600
She got it.
She got it.

3646
02:29:44,660 --> 02:29:46,610
She got it.
And does is good for everybody.

3647
02:29:46,611 --> 02:29:47,444
That's good for everybody.
But you know what else is good for 

3648
02:29:48,471 --> 02:29:49,130
everybody,
right?

3649
02:29:49,130 --> 02:29:52,120
Forgiveness,
forgiveness as good if someone asks.

3650
02:29:52,160 --> 02:29:54,410
Yeah.
Just you say we forgive you.

3651
02:29:54,411 --> 02:29:56,480
It's,
I can't get for owning up to it.

3652
02:29:56,510 --> 02:29:57,380
I appreciate it.
You know,

3653
02:29:57,381 --> 02:29:58,214
you were wrong.
They fucked up and she probably didn't 

3654
02:29:59,871 --> 02:30:00,704
know she fucked up.
She probably was hormonal and she's 

3655
02:30:02,391 --> 02:30:03,530
probably not,
you know,

3656
02:30:03,531 --> 02:30:06,230
not thinking so good.
And the whole thing to be like,

3657
02:30:06,640 --> 02:30:07,550
all right.
You said,

3658
02:30:07,551 --> 02:30:09,170
you said you're sorry.
It's all bad.

3659
02:30:09,171 --> 02:30:10,370
She,
she did never done that.

3660
02:30:10,371 --> 02:30:12,610
And who knows if she would have done it?
Everybody kid.

3661
02:30:12,770 --> 02:30:14,450
She said it to the people.
Hey,

3662
02:30:14,500 --> 02:30:15,770
one on one.
I'm sorry.

3663
02:30:15,771 --> 02:30:16,420
I did.
That was,

3664
02:30:16,420 --> 02:30:18,190
that was my bad.
Yeah.

3665
02:30:18,270 --> 02:30:19,103
You people,
you kind of got to let people learn and 

3666
02:30:20,811 --> 02:30:21,570
grow.

3667
02:30:21,570 --> 02:30:23,090
You know,
I don't accept your apology.

3668
02:30:23,110 --> 02:30:23,943
Oh,
so it's like nothing happened to the 

3669
02:30:24,920 --> 02:30:25,520
daughter,
right.

3670
02:30:25,520 --> 02:30:27,770
She didn't get arrested is a creepy 
experience fill.

3671
02:30:27,771 --> 02:30:28,270
Okay.
Yeah.

3672
02:30:28,270 --> 02:30:30,110
I mean it really is.
Imagine some,

3673
02:30:31,010 --> 02:30:34,640
fuck you and accept your apology.
Fucking pro wrestling size white lady.

3674
02:30:34,730 --> 02:30:35,563
Remember that old lady after the,
after the court trial and she punched 

3675
02:30:38,031 --> 02:30:39,250
out of the lady in the face.
Oh yeah.

3676
02:30:39,650 --> 02:30:40,700
That was a good one.
She was like,

3677
02:30:40,740 --> 02:30:41,491
yeah,
your daughter does.

3678
02:30:41,491 --> 02:30:45,230
And she's like,
fuck y'all face and rub it in right now.

3679
02:30:45,231 --> 02:30:47,000
Say you're sorry.
Yeah.

3680
02:30:47,070 --> 02:30:49,160
Be a be a positive winter.
Yeah.

3681
02:30:49,370 --> 02:30:51,020
Yeah.
Except an apology of the loser.

3682
02:30:51,920 --> 02:30:54,350
Yeah,
man.

3683
02:30:54,920 --> 02:30:55,753
It's just people aren't here for that.
Long as a Rhonda Rousey was garbage too 

3684
02:31:01,011 --> 02:31:01,910
and that lady was like,
Hey,

3685
02:31:01,911 --> 02:31:02,750
I'm sorry.
Good fight.

3686
02:31:02,751 --> 02:31:03,411
She's like,
fuck off.

3687
02:31:03,411 --> 02:31:05,600
Get Out to talk about my family.
It's like you're white trash.

3688
02:31:06,470 --> 02:31:07,303
Well she's a super winner.
Those super winners is taking it down a 

3689
02:31:10,581 --> 02:31:11,414
notch.
I had heard if you lose a game or if 

3690
02:31:12,891 --> 02:31:13,724
Michael Jordan lose a game of pool,
he wouldn't talk to you for like two 

3691
02:31:15,381 --> 02:31:16,214
weeks.
Really?

3692
02:31:16,500 --> 02:31:19,080
It's crazy.
If you heard that you've heard shit like

3693
02:31:19,081 --> 02:31:19,890
that.
Right.

3694
02:31:19,890 --> 02:31:20,723
I heard that he wears crazy giant pants 
just in case someone ever wants to play 

3695
02:31:23,371 --> 02:31:25,140
one on one.
He could pull those fucking pants off.

3696
02:31:25,180 --> 02:31:26,100
He'd go,
yeah.

3697
02:31:26,400 --> 02:31:27,233
Cause he used to rumor,
he was the bet with the rest of the 

3698
02:31:28,561 --> 02:31:31,260
team.
What he wears giant ass pants.

3699
02:31:32,100 --> 02:31:34,980
Those are pull away.
He's ready to fuck you.

3700
02:31:34,981 --> 02:31:35,814
So competitive Houston bet with the rest
of the team who's bag was going to come 

3701
02:31:37,501 --> 02:31:38,590
out first.
What?

3702
02:31:38,660 --> 02:31:39,493
Like a hundred bucks or 1000 bucks and 
then pay the fucking later pay the 

3703
02:31:43,501 --> 02:31:44,640
people at the airport like,
Hey,

3704
02:31:44,641 --> 02:31:46,470
when my back comes,
you need to let it come off first.

3705
02:31:47,140 --> 02:31:49,160
I want to win that fucking bed.
Oh Geez.

3706
02:31:49,170 --> 02:31:50,550
Yeah.
That's fucked up.

3707
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:53,960
He rigged the system.
Yeah,

3708
02:31:54,030 --> 02:31:54,863
he was a degenerate gambler or still is 
with the hundreds of millions of 

3709
02:31:58,650 --> 02:31:59,483
dollars,
which is a crazy combination with the 

3710
02:31:59,971 --> 02:32:02,490
killed his father.
That was the rumor.

3711
02:32:02,491 --> 02:32:03,720
Right?
A lot of people say that.

3712
02:32:04,080 --> 02:32:05,790
That's so scary.
If that was true,

3713
02:32:06,410 --> 02:32:08,460
that he didn't steal anything from them,
they just killed him.

3714
02:32:08,670 --> 02:32:10,860
That is so scary.
And people like,

3715
02:32:10,861 --> 02:32:12,230
why don't they killed Jordan then?
Cause I'm,

3716
02:32:12,240 --> 02:32:14,880
they don't get their money.
Jesus Christ.

3717
02:32:15,230 --> 02:32:16,063
Yeah.
Did they ever catch the guy who killed 

3718
02:32:16,741 --> 02:32:18,270
his dad?
I don't believe they did.

3719
02:32:19,910 --> 02:32:22,530
They did.
Do you think they did the same jail?

3720
02:32:24,810 --> 02:32:28,140
Somebody was contacting me about this 
one guy from jail.

3721
02:32:28,650 --> 02:32:32,070
Now they spoken to him in jail about 
this.

3722
02:32:32,100 --> 02:32:34,560
She was a mafia hit man.
Or you think it was a dude?

3723
02:32:35,010 --> 02:32:37,080
Have you watched wild,
wild country?

3724
02:32:37,110 --> 02:32:39,030
It's the best.
Holy Shit.

3725
02:32:39,031 --> 02:32:39,864
Okay.
When you're one or two episodes into 

3726
02:32:40,681 --> 02:32:42,060
that,
I'm four episodes in.

3727
02:32:42,210 --> 02:32:42,721
Perfect.
Perfect.

3728
02:32:42,721 --> 02:32:44,100
Perfect.
So you can get this.

3729
02:32:44,580 --> 02:32:46,740
Um,
how much of you thinks,

3730
02:32:47,610 --> 02:32:48,443
oh,
Duncan could start one of these a 

3731
02:32:50,010 --> 02:32:50,843
thousand,
a thousand peace and happiness and 

3732
02:32:53,191 --> 02:32:55,770
fucking wearing the same shit.
It's a great dude.

3733
02:32:55,771 --> 02:32:56,604
I was talking to these people seem cool.
I was talking to my friend todd and he 

3734
02:32:59,341 --> 02:33:00,031
was like,
dude,

3735
02:33:00,031 --> 02:33:02,040
I,
I wanted to live like that.

3736
02:33:02,970 --> 02:33:04,020
Two episodes in,
and they're like,

3737
02:33:04,021 --> 02:33:05,190
yeah man,
what the fuck?

3738
02:33:06,970 --> 02:33:07,803
I'll wear red.
It was like the first episodes of sons 

3739
02:33:09,211 --> 02:33:14,211
of anarchy opposite way it looks and 
they seem like they're happy.

3740
02:33:14,760 --> 02:33:18,270
They are happy.
They're having a good old time.

3741
02:33:18,690 --> 02:33:22,380
The duplass brothers made that those 
guys are bad ass.

3742
02:33:22,490 --> 02:33:24,540
Yeah.
That's an amazing documentary.

3743
02:33:24,570 --> 02:33:25,590
It's fuck it.
Right?

3744
02:33:25,620 --> 02:33:27,930
This story is so insane.
While I'm watching,

3745
02:33:27,931 --> 02:33:29,490
I'm like,
how the fuck did I not know,

3746
02:33:29,870 --> 02:33:30,703
not know about it?
It was so good that I thought it was a 

3747
02:33:32,341 --> 02:33:33,960
work for a while.
I would say.

3748
02:33:33,990 --> 02:33:36,750
I think they might be faking this.
Oh God.

3749
02:33:37,800 --> 02:33:39,720
So obviously Tom Brokaw talking about 
it,

3750
02:33:39,721 --> 02:33:40,411
you're like,
all right.

3751
02:33:40,411 --> 02:33:42,420
I guess.
I guess it's never happened.

3752
02:33:42,600 --> 02:33:43,433
I got a friend of mine,
his girlfriend's parents were in that 

3753
02:33:46,051 --> 02:33:47,160
group.
Really?

3754
02:33:47,190 --> 02:33:48,690
Yeah,
and they still,

3755
02:33:48,750 --> 02:33:52,680
they still follow that guy's teachings.
They still believe in him.

3756
02:33:52,710 --> 02:33:54,510
The mog.
Why the o show?

3757
02:33:54,511 --> 02:33:56,080
Is that his name?
His name?

3758
02:33:56,260 --> 02:33:58,350
What was his name?
It wasn't Mogra.

3759
02:33:58,351 --> 02:33:59,184
That's gremlins.
A picture that I had of him that I put 

3760
02:34:01,021 --> 02:34:05,100
up on my instagram page of him holding 
this white guy's head,

3761
02:34:05,310 --> 02:34:06,960
and this guy's like coming in his pants.

3762
02:34:07,070 --> 02:34:09,600
He was one of the freakiest this up 
Jamie.

3763
02:34:10,260 --> 02:34:11,520
He's just playing like,
you can have money.

3764
02:34:11,521 --> 02:34:12,890
You can have nice things.
Yeah.

3765
02:34:13,610 --> 02:34:17,470
22 fucking Rolls Royce.
Let's look at this.

3766
02:34:17,500 --> 02:34:18,580
Oh,
he'll get the guy.

3767
02:34:18,581 --> 02:34:19,450
The guy's like,
oh my,

3768
02:34:19,520 --> 02:34:22,270
why are you touching you?
I'm so white.

3769
02:34:22,780 --> 02:34:24,430
He's touching both of them at the same 
time.

3770
02:34:24,431 --> 02:34:26,140
Lefthand and the dude right hand the 
girl,

3771
02:34:26,141 --> 02:34:29,860
he's like transmitting through them,
giving them orgasms.

3772
02:34:29,861 --> 02:34:30,400
Look at him.
He's like,

3773
02:34:30,400 --> 02:34:33,070
oh,
oh my God.

3774
02:34:33,071 --> 02:34:34,180
They believed in it,
man.

3775
02:34:34,370 --> 02:34:35,740
I get it.
We're all going to fucking go ahead.

3776
02:34:35,741 --> 02:34:38,500
Go ahead and pitch the crazy.
Have you seen any of this Jamie?

3777
02:34:39,370 --> 02:34:42,220
I think I turned it on and fell asleep 
and having to tell you.

3778
02:34:42,240 --> 02:34:46,180
You believe that shit,
dude.

3779
02:34:46,181 --> 02:34:47,590
It's fucking amazing,
man.

3780
02:34:47,591 --> 02:34:49,990
I'm,
I'm on episode four now and I don't want

3781
02:34:49,991 --> 02:34:51,740
to give anything away,
uh,

3782
02:34:51,750 --> 02:34:53,320
in,
in terms of like how it goes down,

3783
02:34:53,321 --> 02:34:57,820
but it literally keeps ramping up and 
getting more and more fucking insane.

3784
02:34:58,290 --> 02:34:58,930
I,
I've,

3785
02:34:58,930 --> 02:34:59,763
I'm like what Ari said,
I can't believe I didn't hear about 

3786
02:35:01,421 --> 02:35:03,520
this.
How do we know about Jones town?

3787
02:35:03,550 --> 02:35:08,080
Everybody knows don't drink the Koolaid.
This is an Oregon outside of antelope,

3788
02:35:08,081 --> 02:35:10,030
Oregon too.
I mean,

3789
02:35:10,090 --> 02:35:12,280
I don't want to,
I can't give too much away,

3790
02:35:12,310 --> 02:35:15,520
but these people bought a town,
they bought the whole town.

3791
02:35:16,600 --> 02:35:19,540
They got a police force.
Do they have their own police force?

3792
02:35:20,470 --> 02:35:23,710
What are the odds that something like 
that is going on now?

3793
02:35:24,280 --> 02:35:25,113
It's super low.
It's super low because what this is is 

3794
02:35:27,250 --> 02:35:28,083
they,
what the government had stepped in and 

3795
02:35:30,341 --> 02:35:33,040
realize that there's some shenanigans 
going on and they were essentially,

3796
02:35:33,041 --> 02:35:36,100
there was no separation of church and 
state because the church was the state,

3797
02:35:36,370 --> 02:35:37,203
right?
They had a government and police force 

3798
02:35:38,950 --> 02:35:39,783
that was run by the church.
They called it a peace force and the 

3799
02:35:42,911 --> 02:35:43,744
whole cult basically ran the town except
for a few diehards who didn't want to 

3800
02:35:47,471 --> 02:35:48,460
give their houses up.

3801
02:35:48,610 --> 02:35:51,400
So there was some folks who had been 
living in antelope their whole life.

3802
02:35:51,700 --> 02:35:52,533
They didn't give their houses up and 
they're telling the story and they did 

3803
02:35:54,941 --> 02:35:57,550
not care for it.
It was fucking amazing,

3804
02:35:57,551 --> 02:35:59,740
man.
So jealous of you of having not seen the

3805
02:35:59,741 --> 02:36:01,960
whole next call.
And this is another one,

3806
02:36:01,961 --> 02:36:02,850
right?
It's a different one.

3807
02:36:02,851 --> 02:36:04,920
It's the one with the actress that got 
calories.

3808
02:36:04,950 --> 02:36:05,783
So that's,
is that a similar type cult things that 

3809
02:36:08,321 --> 02:36:09,940
deal with that actress?
I don't know.

3810
02:36:10,220 --> 02:36:12,580
She did.
She really recruit people knowing it was

3811
02:36:12,581 --> 02:36:14,710
a sex cult.
I don't know if that's the same thing.

3812
02:36:15,280 --> 02:36:16,113
I don't have as many people.
I don't know much about this sex cult 

3813
02:36:17,891 --> 02:36:19,340
thing with that actress lady.
I was like,

3814
02:36:19,760 --> 02:36:23,770
the whole story starts branding.
They were branding people but she was,

3815
02:36:23,980 --> 02:36:28,210
she was a part of it and she was 
recruiting people into allegedly this is

3816
02:36:28,211 --> 02:36:30,830
what they're charging or what I feel is 
more to the story than I did.

3817
02:36:30,880 --> 02:36:33,220
I can tell,
I don't know man,

3818
02:36:33,221 --> 02:36:37,210
but it's weird that people are so 
susceptible to cults and that we protect

3819
02:36:37,211 --> 02:36:39,850
people from cults but don't protect 
people from religions.

3820
02:36:40,180 --> 02:36:41,013
It's the same shit.
The only difference is this one guy is 

3821
02:36:43,631 --> 02:36:46,030
banging all these people and we got to 
stop that.

3822
02:36:47,980 --> 02:36:48,813
There was sex crimes,
there was like teen trafficking and 

3823
02:36:50,801 --> 02:36:51,640
there was,
there was,

3824
02:36:51,670 --> 02:36:54,520
there was illegal things that were done 
in this particular one,

3825
02:36:54,610 --> 02:36:56,440
from what I've read,
I don't know too much about it,

3826
02:36:56,650 --> 02:37:01,180
but then when you go to that Osho guy 
and it seemed,

3827
02:37:01,720 --> 02:37:02,553
except for church and state.
See the thing is the church started 

3828
02:37:04,691 --> 02:37:05,524
running the police force remember and 
they had these guys walking around with 

3829
02:37:08,501 --> 02:37:10,520
fucking,
you know,

3830
02:37:10,590 --> 02:37:13,900
semi automatic rifles and the high 
powered machine guns and shit.

3831
02:37:14,050 --> 02:37:15,620
It was very different.
It was like,

3832
02:37:15,650 --> 02:37:16,040
okay,
you've

3833
02:37:16,040 --> 02:37:19,680
got a military force that's guarding 
this religious leader.

3834
02:37:20,280 --> 02:37:21,113
Yeah.
So they had these police people at the 

3835
02:37:22,761 --> 02:37:25,400
compound in the hallways with machine 
guns.

3836
02:37:25,401 --> 02:37:28,790
These guys are playing assassin and 
maybe they are the police force or not.

3837
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:30,220
Then a private.
Exactly.

3838
02:37:30,410 --> 02:37:31,191
Uh,
what's it called?

3839
02:37:31,191 --> 02:37:33,170
Group.
I don't want to give any more away.

3840
02:37:33,171 --> 02:37:35,420
I just want to watch my watch and by the
way,

3841
02:37:35,421 --> 02:37:37,640
everything I've said is not going to 
take anything away from sure.

3842
02:37:37,700 --> 02:37:38,533
With the girlfriend or your boyfriend or
your wife or whatever tool you're 

3843
02:37:40,730 --> 02:37:42,020
neighbors with.
Somebody together.

3844
02:37:42,021 --> 02:37:43,730
Let's just like find somebody to be 
like,

3845
02:37:43,731 --> 02:37:45,470
let's watch it one episode every two 
days.

3846
02:37:45,471 --> 02:37:47,330
Let's talk about it.
Oh it's so fun.

3847
02:37:47,360 --> 02:37:51,890
I think an independent version of that 
is in little blips.

3848
02:37:51,950 --> 02:37:52,783
What goes on with burning man,
like just independent little blip of 

3849
02:37:56,121 --> 02:37:59,900
escape of norms of regular society.
And these people get there and they were

3850
02:37:59,901 --> 02:38:00,734
fucking gas masks and fuck each other 
and go crazy and do cartwheels in the 

3851
02:38:03,381 --> 02:38:07,940
dirt and they hang out together having a
great time and they realized that people

3852
02:38:07,980 --> 02:38:11,330
in at least in small bursts can 
establish these communities,

3853
02:38:11,331 --> 02:38:13,820
set up all this temporary art,
have a great time.

3854
02:38:13,820 --> 02:38:15,350
And everybody's like,
you know,

3855
02:38:15,351 --> 02:38:16,184
really like likeminded,
know a lot of ways hanging out in this 

3856
02:38:17,901 --> 02:38:19,020
one place.
Well,

3857
02:38:19,021 --> 02:38:21,740
if that's,
if people want that,

3858
02:38:22,460 --> 02:38:23,293
the only difference between that and 
like a fulltime community is that you 

3859
02:38:28,401 --> 02:38:33,260
would have to figure out a way to get 
everybody to get along forever.

3860
02:38:33,690 --> 02:38:35,780
Well,
could just be a few days.

3861
02:38:35,781 --> 02:38:38,810
You'd have to have raised kids together,
get your food together,

3862
02:38:38,910 --> 02:38:40,850
do it,
but the food have all other jobs.

3863
02:38:40,851 --> 02:38:42,620
You have keyboards is a similar to that.
Yeah.

3864
02:38:42,660 --> 02:38:44,450
But if you tried to do that today,
they would stop you.

3865
02:38:44,480 --> 02:38:46,220
Or at least it would become a real 
issue.

3866
02:38:46,221 --> 02:38:47,054
Like,
say if you decided you and Donkin got 

3867
02:38:48,381 --> 02:38:53,381
together and you two decided to buy 700 
acres in Oregon and you found some place

3868
02:38:53,751 --> 02:38:54,584
that you could all afford.
You did a kickstarter and you guys set 

3869
02:38:56,661 --> 02:38:57,500
up a community out there.

3870
02:38:57,500 --> 02:38:59,480
You grew your own food,
you had your own,

3871
02:38:59,481 --> 02:39:02,360
well,
nobody can be married and you could fuck

3872
02:39:02,361 --> 02:39:04,130
anybody you want.
It's just how we live in.

3873
02:39:04,410 --> 02:39:06,020
That's how we live in.
And then you just,

3874
02:39:06,021 --> 02:39:08,810
you just rent and you like real loosely 
based rules.

3875
02:39:08,811 --> 02:39:09,910
Hey,
when you eat something,

3876
02:39:09,920 --> 02:39:12,860
clean up your mess,
giant mess halls filled with people.

3877
02:39:13,040 --> 02:39:16,270
People have these houses all over this 
fucking ranch and you,

3878
02:39:16,300 --> 02:39:18,650
you basically established a village.
Wow.

3879
02:39:19,230 --> 02:39:20,990
You get,
you just can't go too far.

3880
02:39:21,140 --> 02:39:21,973
Yeah.
But then we started getting money from 

3881
02:39:23,151 --> 02:39:25,580
them.
Then the subway and when somebody breaks

3882
02:39:25,581 --> 02:39:27,790
the real law,
like there's a rape or murder,

3883
02:39:27,800 --> 02:39:28,770
you'd have to be like,
man,

3884
02:39:28,780 --> 02:39:29,810
we need to call them.
Yeah.

3885
02:39:29,811 --> 02:39:32,260
You have to call the cops.
The only way to keep it on file.

3886
02:39:32,780 --> 02:39:34,130
Yeah.
You'd have to keep it legit.

3887
02:39:34,610 --> 02:39:36,350
Like you'd have to still be under the 
jurisdiction.

3888
02:39:36,350 --> 02:39:38,420
You'd have to make friends with the 
local sheriffs.

3889
02:39:38,720 --> 02:39:40,450
That's you'd have to do just like we're 
not,

3890
02:39:40,550 --> 02:39:41,720
we don't mean any harm,
but when we,

3891
02:39:41,780 --> 02:39:43,220
when we need you,
when something happens,

3892
02:39:43,221 --> 02:39:44,054
we'll call you.
But otherwise we're not going to need 

3893
02:39:45,231 --> 02:39:45,620
your much.
Yeah,

3894
02:39:45,620 --> 02:39:47,830
we just got peer banging each other.
Paula,

3895
02:39:49,210 --> 02:39:52,340
I think each other like crazy skit 
getting fucking wild up here,

3896
02:39:52,341 --> 02:39:53,780
son.
That's what we do.

3897
02:39:53,781 --> 02:39:54,550
It's legal,
right?

3898
02:39:54,550 --> 02:39:57,020
It's still leave it a fucking America.
If I pay taxes,

3899
02:39:57,250 --> 02:39:58,100
so my,
my,

3900
02:39:58,190 --> 02:40:01,310
my best buddies,
wife can suck my balls.

3901
02:40:01,540 --> 02:40:02,470
Ass fucking him.
Yeah.

3902
02:40:02,471 --> 02:40:03,690
That's what they're like.
Okay,

3903
02:40:04,070 --> 02:40:05,690
cool.
She likes to suck ball right next to the

3904
02:40:05,691 --> 02:40:08,290
boot heel.
I think a,

3905
02:40:08,300 --> 02:40:09,133
you would run into problems.
People would decide that you shouldn't 

3906
02:40:11,211 --> 02:40:14,340
be living like that.
I don't want angry with everything

3907
02:40:14,520 --> 02:40:15,810
based.
It's with everything.

3908
02:40:15,811 --> 02:40:16,644
You're not living the way I live,
so I'm not going to let anyone be into 

3909
02:40:19,051 --> 02:40:20,780
your shit.
Yeah.

3910
02:40:20,790 --> 02:40:22,500
But it's always like one dude,
right.

3911
02:40:22,501 --> 02:40:25,890
That's running things and I'm one of 
those compounds.

3912
02:40:26,440 --> 02:40:27,273
Faults.
There's always like a main guy who 

3913
02:40:27,841 --> 02:40:29,820
fucks.
Everybody fucks everybody's wife.

3914
02:40:30,030 --> 02:40:30,930
He's like,
fuck everybody you want.

3915
02:40:30,931 --> 02:40:32,510
But you probably want to fuck me.
It caught on the main dude.

3916
02:40:32,550 --> 02:40:35,160
The only way to do it,
honestly to do at burning man style.

3917
02:40:35,161 --> 02:40:38,100
This is my point is that burning man 
style would be no leader.

3918
02:40:38,610 --> 02:40:39,660
No leader.
Yeah,

3919
02:40:39,840 --> 02:40:42,120
no leader.
So likeminded people,

3920
02:40:42,121 --> 02:40:43,670
no leader.
And you'd have to fake,

3921
02:40:43,720 --> 02:40:46,920
the problem is charismatic people could 
co op that they'd have these meetings.

3922
02:40:46,921 --> 02:40:49,060
One person takes over.
Look what we need here.

3923
02:40:49,061 --> 02:40:50,970
Some organization,
next thing you know he's the king.

3924
02:40:51,230 --> 02:40:52,560
You know,
that's how people do.

3925
02:40:52,590 --> 02:40:53,423
We're monkeys.

3926
02:40:54,020 --> 02:40:55,860
Yeah.
If we could avoid that though.

3927
02:40:55,950 --> 02:40:57,810
You crave leadership.
Yeah.

3928
02:40:57,811 --> 02:41:02,070
We'd have to somehow or another find a 
way to not manipulate the way.

3929
02:41:02,260 --> 02:41:03,720
What's his,
as a seat laws,

3930
02:41:03,750 --> 02:41:04,561
are they,
yeah,

3931
02:41:04,561 --> 02:41:07,650
they're not the sex cult,
but they are like,

3932
02:41:07,651 --> 02:41:09,750
everyone has a job we're all working 
for,

3933
02:41:09,780 --> 02:41:11,850
nobody makes money here.
Everybody makes 20 bucks a week.

3934
02:41:11,851 --> 02:41:12,840
Whatever it is,
you know,

3935
02:41:12,841 --> 02:41:16,020
room and board is paid for and that 
makes people feel really good.

3936
02:41:16,080 --> 02:41:18,000
Yeah.
You're doing an equal part.

3937
02:41:18,540 --> 02:41:20,490
One guy could be running the accounting 
for the thing.

3938
02:41:20,491 --> 02:41:21,520
One guy could be,
you know,

3939
02:41:22,320 --> 02:41:24,060
taking eggs.
You know,

3940
02:41:24,061 --> 02:41:26,430
one person takes care of the nursery of 
the kids,

3941
02:41:27,300 --> 02:41:28,133
but like everyone joins in.
Do you ever see that a Werner Herzog 

3942
02:41:30,331 --> 02:41:31,164
movie?
Um,

3943
02:41:31,380 --> 02:41:33,630
life in the taiga.
It's called a,

3944
02:41:33,720 --> 02:41:36,750
I think it's either called happiness.
Happiness are happy.

3945
02:41:36,990 --> 02:41:41,990
Happiness was a todd solondz movie that 
was so good.

3946
02:41:42,780 --> 02:41:45,540
That was [inaudible].
We're like the best.

3947
02:41:45,560 --> 02:41:47,050
It was crazy.
Yeah,

3948
02:41:48,060 --> 02:41:48,893
it was crazy.
I think it's just called happy life in 

3949
02:41:51,271 --> 02:41:54,300
the taiga and it's about these people 
that live in Siberia.

3950
02:41:54,640 --> 02:41:57,660
They were like trappers and shit.
People Happy People.

3951
02:41:58,130 --> 02:42:00,210
They're the like the happiest people on 
Earth.

3952
02:42:00,300 --> 02:42:02,510
They're all like having a great time 
laughing.

3953
02:42:02,680 --> 02:42:04,860
And this is just how they live all the 
time.

3954
02:42:05,190 --> 02:42:08,550
And all they do is go fishing and 
hunting and trapping,

3955
02:42:09,450 --> 02:42:11,270
but they all get together and drink and 
they,

3956
02:42:11,280 --> 02:42:12,113
in these villages,
they have fucking dog sleds that are 

3957
02:42:13,981 --> 02:42:14,814
pulling them down the road and they're 
driving around on jet skis and this is 

3958
02:42:17,431 --> 02:42:20,100
how they live.
Like they live in the fucking Tundra.

3959
02:42:20,101 --> 02:42:21,870
Dude,
it's madness out there.

3960
02:42:22,110 --> 02:42:24,390
They raised these dogs.
They were the,

3961
02:42:24,540 --> 02:42:27,050
there were the happiest in that show.
Exactly right.

3962
02:42:27,051 --> 02:42:27,884
There was,
there's a lesson in there and I went to 

3963
02:42:28,801 --> 02:42:31,410
that cave where it grit fucked Jon snow 
did,

3964
02:42:31,411 --> 02:42:34,940
you can't swim in it anymore because it 
was a fisher broke,

3965
02:42:35,050 --> 02:42:35,883
just was too hot.
I thought about jacking off and there 

3966
02:42:37,621 --> 02:42:39,660
was people around town.
It'd be a thing to do,

3967
02:42:39,730 --> 02:42:40,563
you know,
if you want to get arrested for 

3968
02:42:41,551 --> 02:42:42,720
something,
that's the thing to do.

3969
02:42:42,840 --> 02:42:43,470
You like,
Hey,

3970
02:42:43,470 --> 02:42:45,270
I'm a fan,
a fan.

3971
02:42:45,271 --> 02:42:47,670
I'm a fan.
I'm a real fan.

3972
02:42:47,700 --> 02:42:49,860
I've read the books and know where I'm 
supposed to come.

3973
02:42:55,520 --> 02:42:58,020
We just get Osho to touch your head.
Hey,

3974
02:42:58,021 --> 02:42:59,370
you know what I was thinking what was in
the bathroom?

3975
02:43:00,270 --> 02:43:02,740
No,
what does that gave us some waterfall.

3976
02:43:02,741 --> 02:43:04,470
It's just him.
He's just showing US pretty images.

3977
02:43:04,830 --> 02:43:05,663
Facelift.
Jamie's Jamie's high as fuck over there 

3978
02:43:07,681 --> 02:43:11,830
to shut up.
Um,

3979
02:43:11,920 --> 02:43:12,160
we

3980
02:43:12,160 --> 02:43:12,993
get to say,
how did you guys feel when I was going 

3981
02:43:15,161 --> 02:43:17,230
through all of that?
Like what was the effect on you guys?

3982
02:43:17,530 --> 02:43:19,060
I was very nervous.
Yeah.

3983
02:43:19,061 --> 02:43:21,040
I was very nervous about you.
Um,

3984
02:43:21,800 --> 02:43:22,720
uh,
cause I don't,

3985
02:43:23,050 --> 02:43:23,883
um,
I didn't know what to do and I knew I 

3986
02:43:26,321 --> 02:43:29,440
could do,
I knew I could help you financially.

3987
02:43:29,500 --> 02:43:31,000
Yeah,
I knew I could do that.

3988
02:43:31,060 --> 02:43:34,120
So I did that immediately,
but I didn't know what to do.

3989
02:43:34,150 --> 02:43:34,983
I don't,
I didn't,

3990
02:43:35,210 --> 02:43:40,090
didn't know what it feels like and I 
didn't know what would it be the path to

3991
02:43:40,091 --> 02:43:40,924
take.
But when you offered that you were 

3992
02:43:42,191 --> 02:43:45,100
having problems with your psychiatrist 
and the medication and I said,

3993
02:43:45,101 --> 02:43:45,934
okay,
well let me,

3994
02:43:46,210 --> 02:43:50,200
let me get ahold of Matt,
who I know will know the right people.

3995
02:43:50,250 --> 02:43:53,050
I think I see people,
they don't tell me anything.

3996
02:43:53,320 --> 02:43:54,153
Yeah.
You were like,

3997
02:43:54,160 --> 02:43:56,320
oh,
it was like you were,

3998
02:43:56,350 --> 02:44:01,350
you're such a non complainer that I knew
when I always tell people this story,

3999
02:44:02,381 --> 02:44:04,750
we were playing pool and Ari's limping 
around the table.

4000
02:44:04,750 --> 02:44:06,160
I'm like,
what the fuck happened to your leg man?

4001
02:44:07,160 --> 02:44:08,590
Fucking spider bite or something.
I go,

4002
02:44:08,591 --> 02:44:10,330
what?
Let me see your fucking leg.

4003
02:44:10,600 --> 02:44:14,260
And he pulls his pants up like a dude,
you got to go to the hospital right now.

4004
02:44:14,440 --> 02:44:18,670
You have a very bad staph infection and 
this could fucking kill you.

4005
02:44:18,950 --> 02:44:19,481
Like,
come on,

4006
02:44:19,481 --> 02:44:21,730
you're joking.
I start unscrewing my cue and Mike,

4007
02:44:21,731 --> 02:44:24,820
we're going to the hospital now.
It was so bad.

4008
02:44:24,821 --> 02:44:26,890
But the fact that you're so stoic that 
you will,

4009
02:44:26,891 --> 02:44:27,724
you never complained once while you have
this gigantic pus filled sack on your 

4010
02:44:31,991 --> 02:44:33,790
knee killed.
It was horrible,

4011
02:44:33,791 --> 02:44:34,624
man.
One posted the juke lamb video and they 

4012
02:44:36,341 --> 02:44:37,174
were,
he was like,

4013
02:44:37,240 --> 02:44:38,350
do you know that there?
And he's like,

4014
02:44:38,380 --> 02:44:40,510
ah,
it's bogging you,

4015
02:44:40,520 --> 02:44:41,353
not me.

4016
02:44:44,620 --> 02:44:45,453
So when you were,
when you were telling me that you were 

4017
02:44:47,351 --> 02:44:50,480
doing bad and it wasn't,
you weren't feeling good and you were,

4018
02:44:50,530 --> 02:44:53,020
you were telling me you were suicidal.
I was like,

4019
02:44:53,021 --> 02:44:53,980
okay,
stop.

4020
02:44:54,100 --> 02:44:57,490
We got to now this is,
we're going to figure this out.

4021
02:44:57,760 --> 02:44:59,020
You know,
I don't know what to do.

4022
02:44:59,620 --> 02:45:03,910
We're going to figure this out.
Maybe nervous cause I was nervous that I

4023
02:45:03,911 --> 02:45:08,620
wasn't going to be there when you needed
me to be the hair and you know,

4024
02:45:08,830 --> 02:45:09,730
and you,
I would just,

4025
02:45:10,420 --> 02:45:12,670
I would just get the call just to get 
the call.

4026
02:45:12,990 --> 02:45:14,590
Yeah.
I mean as a friend,

4027
02:45:14,591 --> 02:45:15,424
that's the last thing you want to do is 
have some situation when you feel like 

4028
02:45:17,471 --> 02:45:18,304
maybe you could have called them and you
could have made them feel better and 

4029
02:45:21,461 --> 02:45:24,100
you,
they would've just gotten over that hump

4030
02:45:24,400 --> 02:45:25,420
and then they would have been okay.

4031
02:45:25,420 --> 02:45:29,830
Like you became okay man.
I mean you were my most depressed friend

4032
02:45:30,430 --> 02:45:32,350
and now you're probably one of my 
happiest friends.

4033
02:45:32,410 --> 02:45:33,243
Even after I started seeing that guy,
it's still took months before finding 

4034
02:45:37,181 --> 02:45:38,014
the right pill and then the right dosage
and then he would talk to me every like 

4035
02:45:40,331 --> 02:45:42,850
30 days or whatever it was.
Yeah.

4036
02:45:42,851 --> 02:45:43,684
I remember you describing the process 
and one of the things that was 

4037
02:45:45,640 --> 02:45:48,010
disconcerting to me was how random it 
seemed to be.

4038
02:45:48,200 --> 02:45:49,033
What do you mean?
Which pills they chose and then it's 

4039
02:45:50,771 --> 02:45:53,410
like they're guessing.
That's what seemed insane to me.

4040
02:45:53,411 --> 02:45:55,160
I felt like if you like say,
you know,

4041
02:45:55,161 --> 02:45:58,180
then you got an infection.
They know which antibiotic works best on

4042
02:45:58,181 --> 02:45:59,020
that infection.
Boom,

4043
02:45:59,050 --> 02:46:02,410
they give it to you.
But this one wasn't that cut and dry.

4044
02:46:02,411 --> 02:46:04,390
It was,
they were just trying stuff out on you.

4045
02:46:04,450 --> 02:46:04,900
Yeah.
It's like,

4046
02:46:04,900 --> 02:46:05,860
oh,
you need Ibuprofen,

4047
02:46:05,861 --> 02:46:07,510
you have an inflamed thing.
It'll took it down.

4048
02:46:07,570 --> 02:46:09,230
But they know generally.
Yeah.

4049
02:46:09,231 --> 02:46:10,064
This is like there's,

4050
02:46:10,190 --> 02:46:11,023
from what I get gather,
there's two things could be wrong with 

4051
02:46:14,061 --> 02:46:16,790
you.
You either have too much dopamine,

4052
02:46:16,791 --> 02:46:17,624
too little dopamine,
too much something else or too little 

4053
02:46:20,331 --> 02:46:21,640
something else.
Huh.

4054
02:46:21,710 --> 02:46:22,543
And so each of these pills,
I think they're into two categories or 

4055
02:46:25,101 --> 02:46:27,320
four categories.
And they either,

4056
02:46:28,010 --> 02:46:30,260
they either affect the dopamine or they 
effect the other thing,

4057
02:46:30,770 --> 02:46:33,980
either limited or push more in and then 
the other,

4058
02:46:34,010 --> 02:46:36,440
so they don't know which one's doing it 
to first.

4059
02:46:37,150 --> 02:46:39,020
Uh,
and then once they narrow that down,

4060
02:46:39,320 --> 02:46:41,780
they've got to decide if it's like 
getting too much of it or too little.

4061
02:46:42,230 --> 02:46:44,870
I don't know if you're bipolars are 
separate thing,

4062
02:46:44,900 --> 02:46:48,170
they're just guessing.
And then while you take this shit,

4063
02:46:48,200 --> 02:46:53,200
you've added the horrible feelings and 
then added some awful side effect and it

4064
02:46:54,270 --> 02:46:55,490
just like,
ah,

4065
02:46:57,020 --> 02:46:57,853
this is one of the things that I really 
wanted to point out when when Bruce 

4066
02:47:01,670 --> 02:47:04,610
Roseanne was going to come on,
I wanted to really talk about medication

4067
02:47:04,790 --> 02:47:07,730
and how we're,
we're asking this really,

4068
02:47:08,650 --> 02:47:09,483
you know,
she's an elderly woman who's taking an 

4069
02:47:11,781 --> 02:47:13,160
incredible amount of medication.

4070
02:47:13,190 --> 02:47:16,970
She's taking a lot of shit.
She takes ambien every night.

4071
02:47:17,510 --> 02:47:18,343
She's drinking,
she's smoking pot and she's on a host 

4072
02:47:20,721 --> 02:47:21,554
and meds and these things are all doing 
battle in her head and she barely knows 

4073
02:47:27,261 --> 02:47:29,450
what the fuck she's saying.
Some of the time she's saying it.

4074
02:47:29,451 --> 02:47:33,410
She's in an ambient Hayes's in and out 
of it and she's open about it.

4075
02:47:33,710 --> 02:47:34,431
You know,
she's like,

4076
02:47:34,431 --> 02:47:39,431
I need to get them to adjust my meds.
But everybody's is attacking her.

4077
02:47:39,471 --> 02:47:42,110
Like she can never recover.
She's feel righteous.

4078
02:47:42,111 --> 02:47:46,430
But it's weird because I was such at the
forefront of putting on like homosexuals

4079
02:47:46,431 --> 02:47:48,410
into mainstream media.
You know,

4080
02:47:48,470 --> 02:47:50,630
she didn't give a shit and suddenly it's
like,

4081
02:47:50,631 --> 02:47:51,464
no,
it's all gone.

4082
02:47:51,770 --> 02:47:54,300
You from a joke and people like she 
wasn't joking.

4083
02:47:54,301 --> 02:47:55,134
I'm like for sure she was joking whether
or not you think she should have used 

4084
02:47:57,141 --> 02:47:57,710
those words.

4085
02:47:57,710 --> 02:47:59,690
And by the way that that lady does look 
fucking Jewish.

4086
02:47:59,691 --> 02:48:03,200
His shit that she was talking about.
But like to say it's not a joke.

4087
02:48:03,230 --> 02:48:06,320
Let me just explain to everybody as a 
professional comedian,

4088
02:48:06,321 --> 02:48:10,580
as an expert in this,
when someone says this person looks like

4089
02:48:10,581 --> 02:48:13,630
a mixture of this and this,
that his joke form,

4090
02:48:13,820 --> 02:48:15,890
that's not a,
that's a pure joke.

4091
02:48:16,070 --> 02:48:18,110
That's what that is.
You see that over and over again.

4092
02:48:18,350 --> 02:48:20,720
You see this person looks like this 
mixed with this.

4093
02:48:20,930 --> 02:48:23,510
This guy has a work ethic of this works 
with the,

4094
02:48:23,511 --> 02:48:25,880
it's like that's a joke for,
that's clearly a joke.

4095
02:48:25,910 --> 02:48:27,360
Yeah.
To say it's rice,

4096
02:48:27,361 --> 02:48:27,981
it's fine.
Whatever.

4097
02:48:27,981 --> 02:48:30,050
But the sign is not a joke.
You're being ridiculous.

4098
02:48:31,360 --> 02:48:32,900
Yeah.
It's obviously a joke.

4099
02:48:33,170 --> 02:48:34,700
It just,
you can't say that joke.

4100
02:48:34,760 --> 02:48:35,750
That's what we were saying.
Yeah.

4101
02:48:35,980 --> 02:48:37,610
I was like,
it's not a joke cause you can't say that

4102
02:48:37,611 --> 02:48:38,060
choke.

4103
02:48:38,060 --> 02:48:39,400
Yeah,
definitely joke.

4104
02:48:39,430 --> 02:48:41,690
But if she was black,
she'd be able to tell a joke easy.

4105
02:48:42,200 --> 02:48:46,190
Like if Miss Pat said that joke instead 
of Roseanne and everybody be like,

4106
02:48:46,280 --> 02:48:47,113
ah,
she does look the water related in any 

4107
02:48:48,591 --> 02:48:51,260
way from her fucking conservativeness.
Yes.

4108
02:48:51,540 --> 02:48:52,373
Well she's also Nadea Squirrel Shit.
She just is and she loves to go on 

4109
02:48:57,261 --> 02:49:01,100
twitter and talk crazy stuff and she had
apologized leading 200 times a day.

4110
02:49:01,160 --> 02:49:01,993
George Soros for calling him a Nazi and 
like it's so much instill continues to 

4111
02:49:05,721 --> 02:49:07,070
tweet.
She's tweeting like crazy.

4112
02:49:07,350 --> 02:49:08,490
It's all insane,
man.

4113
02:49:08,910 --> 02:49:11,070
You gotta you gotta if you're doing 
network thing and they got it,

4114
02:49:11,100 --> 02:49:13,740
they got your friends got to take away 
or twitter and various all about shit.

4115
02:49:13,800 --> 02:49:14,790
Okay.
You just can't use,

4116
02:49:14,791 --> 02:49:16,620
those are going to get you on something.
You just can't.

4117
02:49:16,700 --> 02:49:19,710
We have an operator got a hundred people
working on that set.

4118
02:49:19,770 --> 02:49:20,603
They all,
all of them actually they're going to 

4119
02:49:21,621 --> 02:49:22,454
switch over to,
they're going to call it some new show 

4120
02:49:23,671 --> 02:49:23,890
now.

4121
02:49:23,890 --> 02:49:24,631
Right?
The con isn't,

4122
02:49:24,631 --> 02:49:25,530
but by the way,
I don't think.

4123
02:49:26,220 --> 02:49:27,053
Yeah,
I don't think they should have fired 

4124
02:49:27,541 --> 02:49:28,470
her.
I really don't.

4125
02:49:28,471 --> 02:49:30,690
I don't think so.
You got to let her apologize.

4126
02:49:30,691 --> 02:49:33,690
And you know,
she explains herself and you realize who

4127
02:49:33,691 --> 02:49:38,220
she is and she's not terrible person.
She's not so easy to put somebody as one

4128
02:49:38,221 --> 02:49:39,054
action.
This is something I read a biography of 

4129
02:49:41,371 --> 02:49:44,670
her conversations on songs to key,
uh,

4130
02:49:44,730 --> 02:49:47,520
me and mark leader.
It was like house arrest for 20 years.

4131
02:49:47,580 --> 02:49:50,670
She was a Nobel peace prize prize for 
writing.

4132
02:49:51,240 --> 02:49:52,073
Um,
and she was talking about the Burmese 

4133
02:49:54,331 --> 02:49:56,590
army who was torture her.
I had,

4134
02:49:56,591 --> 02:49:57,490
uh,
you know,

4135
02:49:57,750 --> 02:49:58,583
killed and arrested forever.
A lot of her colleagues and there was 

4136
02:50:01,921 --> 02:50:03,240
like,
look,

4137
02:50:03,270 --> 02:50:08,270
they're not all bad.
You can't make someone into one of their

4138
02:50:08,431 --> 02:50:09,980
actions.
So just goes,

4139
02:50:10,200 --> 02:50:11,033
even if you've committed murder,
one of the worst things you can do that 

4140
02:50:14,521 --> 02:50:15,960
is not who you are.

4141
02:50:16,140 --> 02:50:17,880
You're just someone who has committed 
murder.

4142
02:50:18,090 --> 02:50:19,410
She goes,
now there's a certain point,

4143
02:50:19,530 --> 02:50:23,250
we've done so much murder that you now 
are really wholly a murderer.

4144
02:50:23,410 --> 02:50:24,930
Right?
But that's very rare.

4145
02:50:24,940 --> 02:50:27,120
What's much more common if someone who 
has killed somebody,

4146
02:50:27,180 --> 02:50:29,640
they're now no longer that person.
20 years later,

4147
02:50:29,641 --> 02:50:31,560
I have someone who kills,
you know,

4148
02:50:31,561 --> 02:50:33,750
and if to make somebody to one of their 
actions is,

4149
02:50:34,140 --> 02:50:36,180
it's dehumanizing to all of us.
It is.

4150
02:50:36,181 --> 02:50:39,960
And it's also,
there's targets where people see someone

4151
02:50:39,961 --> 02:50:40,794
who leg is a Roseann who's like some 
sort of cultural icon and they like to 

4152
02:50:45,151 --> 02:50:49,920
shift it on them and attack them.
They like to go after them when some,

4153
02:50:49,921 --> 02:50:53,610
there's been some transgression,
they'd done something which she did do.

4154
02:50:53,670 --> 02:50:55,500
If you know,
it upsets people.

4155
02:50:55,590 --> 02:51:00,590
So they want to attack in.
Oh a go really unbalanced way.

4156
02:51:01,680 --> 02:51:03,540
They want to end it all for her.

4157
02:51:03,900 --> 02:51:05,580
There's no way you can ever,
uh,

4158
02:51:05,581 --> 02:51:06,720
bounce back from that.
Yeah.

4159
02:51:06,721 --> 02:51:07,554
They don't want,
they wanted pile on and want to kick 

4160
02:51:09,031 --> 02:51:11,130
people whether down.
Cause now it's my chance to kick you.

4161
02:51:11,160 --> 02:51:13,770
It's a terrible lack of compassion.
That comes from two things.

4162
02:51:13,771 --> 02:51:15,900
I think one,
it comes from a jealousy.

4163
02:51:16,200 --> 02:51:19,740
There's a natural jealousy that we all 
have four super successful people.

4164
02:51:19,741 --> 02:51:20,530
When they fail,
they go,

4165
02:51:20,530 --> 02:51:22,080
ha ha,
I knew it.

4166
02:51:22,110 --> 02:51:23,190
I knew it,
I knew it.

4167
02:51:23,191 --> 02:51:25,350
And now I have justification to attack 
you.

4168
02:51:26,310 --> 02:51:29,100
I think there's a little bit of that.
And I think there's also,

4169
02:51:30,450 --> 02:51:35,450
when people feel like shit,
they want other people to feel like shit

4170
02:51:36,120 --> 02:51:36,953
too.
Yeah.

4171
02:51:37,500 --> 02:51:38,333
You know?
And I think this is what I think these 

4172
02:51:40,231 --> 02:51:42,090
attacks on people,
these rabbit attacks,

4173
02:51:42,091 --> 02:51:44,010
it's not coming from you.
It's not coming from me.

4174
02:51:44,011 --> 02:51:45,900
We're not screaming for the death of 
Roseanne.

4175
02:51:45,930 --> 02:51:49,470
And even the people that are really the,
most of the people just go,

4176
02:51:49,530 --> 02:51:52,050
that's fucking bullshit what you did.
And then the network,

4177
02:51:52,051 --> 02:51:53,550
here's all these people say,
that's bullshit.

4178
02:51:53,580 --> 02:51:54,750
Yes.
You know,

4179
02:51:55,230 --> 02:51:56,063
I think it's just,
it's symptom of where human beings are 

4180
02:51:59,581 --> 02:52:00,414
today.
I think there's so many human beings 

4181
02:52:01,711 --> 02:52:04,470
that are hurting,
and so when something comes up and gives

4182
02:52:04,471 --> 02:52:06,040
them a legitimate to be upset,

4183
02:52:06,370 --> 02:52:07,203
they just attack it full force.
But what disturbs me is the lack of an 

4184
02:52:11,770 --> 02:52:12,603
overwhelming voice for compassion.
The lack of an overwhelming voice of 

4185
02:52:16,841 --> 02:52:17,800
people saying,
Hey,

4186
02:52:17,890 --> 02:52:18,730
look,
real,

4187
02:52:18,731 --> 02:52:19,564
real racism is awful.
But this lady who probably did commit 

4188
02:52:23,591 --> 02:52:26,290
real racism by calling the cops and that
eight year old girl,

4189
02:52:26,620 --> 02:52:30,550
she's just a fucked up person.
What does this all better?

4190
02:52:30,551 --> 02:52:31,600
To just forgive her.

4191
02:52:31,870 --> 02:52:33,720
What happened to like,
here's,

4192
02:52:33,721 --> 02:52:36,990
I think there's some mistakes that the 
left and the right makes when trying to,

4193
02:52:36,991 --> 02:52:38,860
like when there's an e mob,
you know,

4194
02:52:39,720 --> 02:52:41,650
it's,
they seek to punish over,

4195
02:52:41,651 --> 02:52:43,360
educate.
They're not looking for,

4196
02:52:43,361 --> 02:52:44,950
to make the person changes their 
opinion.

4197
02:52:45,250 --> 02:52:46,150
They go,
you're ignorant.

4198
02:52:46,151 --> 02:52:46,984
And then they leave it at that.
So probably the thing I got the most 

4199
02:52:49,631 --> 02:52:52,480
flack for in my life was the amazing 
racist videos.

4200
02:52:53,200 --> 02:52:54,500
Um,
Gee,

4201
02:52:54,510 --> 02:52:55,560
I wonder why.
Yeah,

4202
02:52:55,590 --> 02:52:57,330
I mean over and over,
getting new people find it and say,

4203
02:52:57,331 --> 02:52:58,320
fuck you,
you're racist.

4204
02:52:58,530 --> 02:53:02,370
I have maybe gotten three texts message.
I mean,

4205
02:53:02,371 --> 02:53:04,350
I've gotten hundreds and hundreds of 
death threats.

4206
02:53:04,730 --> 02:53:08,000
I've gotten thousands and thousands of 
angry fuck you's racist.

4207
02:53:08,001 --> 02:53:11,520
Racista I'm whatever,
but maybe only three total.

4208
02:53:11,521 --> 02:53:13,760
And I can really think of too of people 
going,

4209
02:53:13,761 --> 02:53:14,750
hey,
just so you know,

4210
02:53:14,780 --> 02:53:17,930
this is why that hurts me because I was 
an immigrant here.

4211
02:53:17,931 --> 02:53:20,710
And then when I see stuff like this,
it reinforces the feeling that I'm like,

4212
02:53:21,170 --> 02:53:22,003
maybe that's it.
Of the thousands and thousands of the 

4213
02:53:24,201 --> 02:53:25,034
other way of fuck you.
So you're not really trying to educate 

4214
02:53:27,561 --> 02:53:30,830
and you want to change their opinion.
You really just trying to like lash out.

4215
02:53:30,860 --> 02:53:31,790
Yeah,
so what is that?

4216
02:53:31,791 --> 02:53:32,690
Why are we all like that?

4217
02:53:33,020 --> 02:53:36,460
Because we're unhappy and you find a 
target and you got a free shot.

4218
02:53:36,670 --> 02:53:38,890
You ever see a guy go down in the 
ghetto?

4219
02:53:39,610 --> 02:53:40,443
You ever see a fight where a guy goes 
down the ghetto and everybody runs in 

4220
02:53:42,071 --> 02:53:43,960
and kicks him in the head?
You see any of those?

4221
02:53:44,500 --> 02:53:47,290
There's a gang of those on a street 
fight videos.

4222
02:53:47,350 --> 02:53:51,160
There's a bunch of street five videos 
and some of the craziest ones are in bad

4223
02:53:51,161 --> 02:53:53,900
neighborhoods where someone gets knocked
out and then where else?

4224
02:53:54,030 --> 02:53:54,863
Bunch of people take free shots on him 
while he's down and out to get a free 

4225
02:53:57,221 --> 02:53:58,054
shot.
There's a bunch of videos like that and 

4226
02:53:59,141 --> 02:54:02,000
there as a person who understands brain 
trauma,

4227
02:54:02,120 --> 02:54:02,953
it's severely disturbing.
When I've talked to so many of these 

4228
02:54:05,601 --> 02:54:06,434
neuroscientists about the,
like all these blunt force impacts on 

4229
02:54:08,631 --> 02:54:09,464
the brain,
you're seeing the guy was totally 

4230
02:54:10,101 --> 02:54:10,934
unconscious and they want walk by and 
soccer kick him in the head while he's 

4231
02:54:14,031 --> 02:54:14,864
totally unconscious,
just take turns hitting him full blast 

4232
02:54:17,361 --> 02:54:19,220
in the face.
And a bunch of people do it.

4233
02:54:19,221 --> 02:54:20,870
They stop him,
they kick him.

4234
02:54:21,080 --> 02:54:24,680
I mean he's out cold with his pants down
and they are kicking him in the head.

4235
02:54:25,500 --> 02:54:26,333
I don't think people [inaudible] the 
effects that one of those he rages can 

4236
02:54:31,921 --> 02:54:34,710
have on your psyche.
And I think when people,

4237
02:54:34,770 --> 02:54:38,580
they see something like the lion guy or 
that dude who fucking caught a foul ball

4238
02:54:38,581 --> 02:54:42,810
and the cubs game or fuck head metzger 
or anything like that.

4239
02:54:42,870 --> 02:54:44,970
Or they say this lady with the short 
girl,

4240
02:54:45,030 --> 02:54:46,830
it comes at you from everything 
everywhere.

4241
02:54:47,040 --> 02:54:50,430
And then pick the site like the,
the zeitgeists moves on,

4242
02:54:50,431 --> 02:54:51,264
you know,
people kind of move on and think 

4243
02:54:51,551 --> 02:54:52,384
something else.
They're still getting hundreds of stuff 

4244
02:54:53,551 --> 02:54:55,510
a day saying fuck you.
Fuck you.

4245
02:54:55,511 --> 02:54:56,140
Fuck you.
Yeah,

4246
02:54:56,140 --> 02:54:57,380
it's still happening.
Right.

4247
02:54:57,610 --> 02:55:00,570
And so you all move on like nothing 
happened,

4248
02:55:00,600 --> 02:55:03,870
but everyone who's shit on them a little
bit has added to their this,

4249
02:55:03,871 --> 02:55:04,190
this

4250
02:55:04,190 --> 02:55:06,680
overwhelming like this thing you can't 
get out.

4251
02:55:06,681 --> 02:55:09,380
I still think Mexico's flailing off that
shit off.

4252
02:55:09,381 --> 02:55:12,020
He's still trying to defend himself.
All these fucking attackers from fucking

4253
02:55:12,021 --> 02:55:15,470
five years ago,
like three years ago,

4254
02:55:15,620 --> 02:55:17,960
but like you don't just come clean on 
that.

4255
02:55:18,180 --> 02:55:20,660
So all the people adding like,
hey fuck you for killing that lion.

4256
02:55:20,661 --> 02:55:25,010
Like you've added to their fucking break
in psychology.

4257
02:55:25,370 --> 02:55:27,830
It's not an easy thing to get over and 
you don't see it all,

4258
02:55:27,831 --> 02:55:31,210
but it's so much,
I mean,

4259
02:55:31,240 --> 02:55:32,073
Brendan's easy start.
I called him and his wife might get 

4260
02:55:33,591 --> 02:55:37,670
offline right now Ralphie too and that 
shit was happening to him.

4261
02:55:37,850 --> 02:55:38,683
He was like,
you need to give this to someone else 

4262
02:55:39,561 --> 02:55:41,570
because it won't do you want to go?
Even if you know you're wrong.

4263
02:55:41,960 --> 02:55:44,810
Where does he see apologize to all of us
six years earlier and said,

4264
02:55:44,811 --> 02:55:45,644
hey fuck,
I'm sorry I lied and we all made fun of 

4265
02:55:47,511 --> 02:55:47,570
him.

4266
02:55:47,570 --> 02:55:49,340
That was over.
He doesn't need other people going,

4267
02:55:49,341 --> 02:55:50,300
fuck you.
You live with.

4268
02:55:50,301 --> 02:55:51,134
You already know.
I already told everybody I know I was 

4269
02:55:52,161 --> 02:55:53,840
wrong.
You don't need a 10,000

4270
02:55:53,841 --> 02:55:54,674
people telling you that it doesn't do 
anything for you when you've already 

4271
02:55:56,211 --> 02:55:57,350
said yes.
I agree.

4272
02:55:57,800 --> 02:55:58,640
Yeah.
You know,

4273
02:55:58,700 --> 02:56:00,680
they don't care though.
They just want to get the licks in.

4274
02:56:00,770 --> 02:56:02,240
Yeah.
And it's terrible.

4275
02:56:02,300 --> 02:56:06,890
They are the cultural equivalent to this
bar fight kicking somebody down.

4276
02:56:07,700 --> 02:56:08,533
It's a free shots.
And they also want you to know they're 

4277
02:56:10,521 --> 02:56:13,070
disappointed in you and express their 
rage at you.

4278
02:56:13,071 --> 02:56:14,830
I'm following you.
All right.

4279
02:56:14,840 --> 02:56:15,673
Just do it.
Don't fuck a tilt while you're telling 

4280
02:56:16,611 --> 02:56:19,190
me.
But that's adorable.

4281
02:56:19,191 --> 02:56:20,870
When they let you know,
unfollow.

4282
02:56:22,040 --> 02:56:23,750
Ouch.
Jones was right.

4283
02:56:24,650 --> 02:56:25,483
MMM.

4284
02:56:25,770 --> 02:56:26,480
Yeah.
It's,

4285
02:56:26,480 --> 02:56:29,510
it's uh,
it's a nutty time we live in.

4286
02:56:29,540 --> 02:56:30,373
Yeah.
It is a nutty time and it's a time of 

4287
02:56:32,031 --> 02:56:33,440
outrage.
If there's,

4288
02:56:33,441 --> 02:56:38,370
there's outrage sport out there to be 
had and there's,

4289
02:56:38,371 --> 02:56:40,110
you know,
there's legitimate outreach.

4290
02:56:40,620 --> 02:56:41,940
Both,
both things are happening.

4291
02:56:41,970 --> 02:56:43,740
My friend told me about these people in 
DC.

4292
02:56:43,741 --> 02:56:47,010
I'm pulled over on the side of the road,
decently busy highway,

4293
02:56:47,650 --> 02:56:49,420
uh,
maybe sunset boulevard type thing,

4294
02:56:49,810 --> 02:56:53,490
but not businesses like that.
But at busy,

4295
02:56:53,491 --> 02:56:55,140
like let's say three lines here,
three lines there,

4296
02:56:55,260 --> 02:56:56,093
that's all these two kids walking home 
and 10 year old and eight year old 

4297
02:56:57,650 --> 02:56:58,680
that's on their own,
just walking.

4298
02:56:59,450 --> 02:57:00,980
Um,
and this lady pulled over.

4299
02:57:00,981 --> 02:57:01,870
I was like,
what?

4300
02:57:02,630 --> 02:57:04,010
Who are you?
Where's your parents?

4301
02:57:04,690 --> 02:57:05,560
And they're like,
I dunno,

4302
02:57:05,590 --> 02:57:07,090
I think they're probably at home.
I'm not sure.

4303
02:57:07,330 --> 02:57:07,751
I'm just like,
well,

4304
02:57:07,751 --> 02:57:08,501
where are you going?
She said,

4305
02:57:08,501 --> 02:57:09,790
we're going home.
Like,

4306
02:57:09,791 --> 02:57:11,530
where are you coming from?
Like we're coming from the playground.

4307
02:57:11,680 --> 02:57:12,730
And she was like,
no,

4308
02:57:12,760 --> 02:57:13,930
no,
you can't be on your own.

4309
02:57:13,931 --> 02:57:16,060
And she called the cops and that got 
them,

4310
02:57:16,090 --> 02:57:16,923
you know,
pick them up and got them to where they 

4311
02:57:17,471 --> 02:57:19,630
lived.
And the parents were there and like,

4312
02:57:19,631 --> 02:57:20,470
what's all this?
And they're like,

4313
02:57:20,471 --> 02:57:22,990
we saw your kids walking alone.
And they're like,

4314
02:57:23,020 --> 02:57:23,801
yeah,
well for the park,

4315
02:57:23,801 --> 02:57:24,890
right?
And they were like,

4316
02:57:24,891 --> 02:57:25,521
yeah,
the look.

4317
02:57:25,521 --> 02:57:26,540
Yeah,
we taught them how to do that.

4318
02:57:27,290 --> 02:57:28,190
And they're like,
what do you mean?

4319
02:57:28,860 --> 02:57:29,693
We taught them,
we've walked with them from the park 

4320
02:57:30,851 --> 02:57:31,684
enough times and we taught our kids 
enough to where we trust that they can 

4321
02:57:33,931 --> 02:57:34,920
come home for the PUK alone.

4322
02:57:35,520 --> 02:57:37,920
We've taught them how to do that.
We trust them with it.

4323
02:57:38,790 --> 02:57:39,541
And then people are like,
oh,

4324
02:57:39,541 --> 02:57:41,550
I guess so.
And there was a split in the story.

4325
02:57:41,670 --> 02:57:42,503
Most people read it.
90% of the people who read it called 

4326
02:57:43,881 --> 02:57:44,714
yes,
parents should be allowed to trust when 

4327
02:57:46,381 --> 02:57:49,260
their kids are trained enough to do 
things like driving at 16.

4328
02:57:49,261 --> 02:57:51,160
That's a parent's decision.
You know?

4329
02:57:51,500 --> 02:57:53,760
Um,
10% of the people were like,

4330
02:57:53,761 --> 02:57:55,350
no,
I wouldn't do that with my kids.

4331
02:57:55,351 --> 02:57:56,184
That's fuck them.
And those people reached out on twitter 

4332
02:57:58,030 --> 02:57:59,640
on facebook and said,
fuck you.

4333
02:57:59,641 --> 02:58:02,130
Chevy kids taken away from you.
And that 10%,

4334
02:58:02,310 --> 02:58:03,590
even though 90% said,
yeah,

4335
02:58:03,591 --> 02:58:06,750
my parents should be able to teach their
kids whatever that 10% means.

4336
02:58:06,930 --> 02:58:10,800
Thousands of people coming at you saying
you're a horrible teacher.

4337
02:58:10,920 --> 02:58:12,840
You're a horrible father.
Imagine that.

4338
02:58:12,841 --> 02:58:14,130
If thousands of people say,
fuck you,

4339
02:58:14,131 --> 02:58:15,810
you're a bad father,
you're ruining your kids.

4340
02:58:15,990 --> 02:58:18,030
And it kept happening.
It affects you.

4341
02:58:18,510 --> 02:58:20,940
And they didn't do anything wrong.
They didn't tell you about 90% of people

4342
02:58:20,941 --> 02:58:21,391
think,
yeah,

4343
02:58:21,391 --> 02:58:24,480
you're in the right here and you're 
still getting all this negativity.

4344
02:58:24,660 --> 02:58:25,493
Well,
nobody imaging is shit and nobody ever 

4345
02:58:27,001 --> 02:58:28,800
is prepared for them.
No one's prepared for it.

4346
02:58:28,830 --> 02:58:31,260
No one agents,
agencies should have,

4347
02:58:31,261 --> 02:58:32,094
should be on the ready to help their 
client fucking deal with this when it 

4348
02:58:34,621 --> 02:58:35,454
happens,
because it will happen to almost 

4349
02:58:35,731 --> 02:58:36,564
everybody.
You'll have something that will get 

4350
02:58:37,741 --> 02:58:39,460
blown out of proportion.
You gotta be,

4351
02:58:39,490 --> 02:58:42,000
you got to get offline immediately.

4352
02:58:42,960 --> 02:58:43,793
The well,
do you think that some of it comes from 

4353
02:58:45,361 --> 02:58:46,194
people have this feeling that anybody 
who is in that sort of a situation with 

4354
02:58:52,351 --> 02:58:56,100
a clearly wrong,
it was just an open target.

4355
02:58:56,160 --> 02:58:56,820
Oh,
target.

4356
02:58:56,820 --> 02:58:58,020
Fuck them.
I can go off on them.

4357
02:58:58,021 --> 02:58:59,610
Look how easy it is to a Christianity 
joke.

4358
02:58:59,611 --> 02:59:02,400
Now look how hard it was back then and 
for scientology,

4359
02:59:02,401 --> 02:59:04,290
same thing in south park.
Broker up and now you're like,

4360
02:59:04,291 --> 02:59:06,030
you're not brave from making front of 
Scientology.

4361
02:59:06,031 --> 02:59:08,580
Now Christianity,
everybody's doing it.

4362
02:59:08,640 --> 02:59:09,473
Yeah,
that whole brave.

4363
02:59:09,480 --> 02:59:11,100
So make it easy.
Now do that.

4364
02:59:11,101 --> 02:59:13,620
the 60s you have a problem.
Did Not get exhausting.

4365
02:59:13,740 --> 02:59:15,750
Brave telling jokes,
how much just be funny.

4366
02:59:15,900 --> 02:59:17,050
Yeah,
but John,

4367
02:59:17,080 --> 02:59:17,380
Tom,
I,

4368
02:59:17,380 --> 02:59:18,870
I had a great joke.
It's already been covered.

4369
02:59:18,900 --> 02:59:20,040
He goes,
I've got a great story.

4370
02:59:20,041 --> 02:59:22,560
He goes,
how much is a funny one you made up?

4371
02:59:22,650 --> 02:59:23,670
Yeah,
yeah,

4372
02:59:23,720 --> 02:59:24,210
yeah.

4373
02:59:24,210 --> 02:59:25,080
True Story.
True Story.

4374
02:59:25,090 --> 02:59:26,700
Like I don't need a true story.
How about a good one?

4375
02:59:26,910 --> 02:59:27,391
Yeah.
I guys,

4376
02:59:27,391 --> 02:59:29,220
I don't need a true story.
Yeah,

4377
02:59:30,980 --> 02:59:31,813
yeah.
Wait,

4378
02:59:31,820 --> 02:59:32,653
what?
We're just saying.

4379
02:59:32,940 --> 02:59:35,430
I forget.
What were we just saying?

4380
02:59:35,431 --> 02:59:36,660
Jamie,
you forget to,

4381
02:59:37,140 --> 02:59:40,390
God dammit fucking marijuana.
It's got it.

4382
02:59:40,391 --> 02:59:42,090
Side effects.
It does have its side effects.

4383
02:59:42,150 --> 02:59:42,983
Definitely.
There's no doubting that you were 

4384
02:59:44,731 --> 02:59:46,890
talking about he rage.
Yeah.

4385
02:59:46,891 --> 02:59:49,830
Medsker z rage is pretty rough people.
He hasn't gotten out of that yet.

4386
02:59:49,880 --> 02:59:53,530
Oh yeah.
People to fucking man.

4387
02:59:53,630 --> 02:59:54,463
Fuck you.
I just feel like we're stalled out in 

4388
02:59:58,381 --> 03:00:02,040
our cultural evolution in a way that I 
feel like we're,

4389
03:00:02,041 --> 03:00:06,240
we're in these movements of change and I
think I see a lot of positive things,

4390
03:00:06,510 --> 03:00:10,050
but I don't see nearly enough like 
friendliness and compassion.

4391
03:00:10,051 --> 03:00:13,500
I think we really need more of that as 
human beings.

4392
03:00:13,680 --> 03:00:15,090
This is not lasting.

4393
03:00:15,360 --> 03:00:17,370
You're not going to last.
No one's lasting.

4394
03:00:17,880 --> 03:00:19,530
You know,
you're going to die.

4395
03:00:19,560 --> 03:00:22,260
We're all going to die.
We're here for a certain amount of time.

4396
03:00:22,261 --> 03:00:24,540
It's not permanent.
And while you're here,

4397
03:00:24,750 --> 03:00:26,460
we can make everything better for 
everybody.

4398
03:00:26,550 --> 03:00:29,310
Just being nicer to each other.
It can be done.

4399
03:00:29,610 --> 03:00:31,320
I mean,
it's not going to be done.

4400
03:00:31,321 --> 03:00:33,600
So I think,
but he can be done a little drifty.

4401
03:00:33,601 --> 03:00:35,280
I think what you do has got affect your 
own life.

4402
03:00:35,281 --> 03:00:36,114
Say I can't change it for everybody,
but what I can do is every time every 

4403
03:00:39,061 --> 03:00:40,560
one of these blogs make them angry,
it just go.

4404
03:00:40,980 --> 03:00:41,813
I probably don't have the whole story on
this cause that's happened 20 times 

4405
03:00:44,431 --> 03:00:44,941
already.
Oh,

4406
03:00:44,941 --> 03:00:46,170
for sure.
So then it's like,

4407
03:00:46,230 --> 03:00:47,580
I'm not gonna get mad.
You know what I am going to,

4408
03:00:47,581 --> 03:00:48,414
I'm sure people are taking care of this.
What I'm going to do is go outside and 

4409
03:00:50,941 --> 03:00:53,250
enjoy some freedoms that I have like a 
fucking park,

4410
03:00:53,830 --> 03:00:54,663
you know,
actually enjoy your life instead of 

4411
03:00:55,980 --> 03:00:59,620
letting people fucking take you down 
this horrible road to hurt them.

4412
03:00:59,770 --> 03:01:00,190
You're hurting

4413
03:01:00,190 --> 03:01:02,530
yourself and you're wrong or hurting 
them.

4414
03:01:03,200 --> 03:01:04,850
Fucking get out there.
Just leave.

4415
03:01:04,890 --> 03:01:06,460
We call a friend.
Go talk about something.

4416
03:01:07,570 --> 03:01:11,590
Yeah.
It was just a strange time for,

4417
03:01:12,390 --> 03:01:14,380
you know,
just for expressing anger.

4418
03:01:14,410 --> 03:01:15,310
Fuck you.
You're wrong.

4419
03:01:15,340 --> 03:01:16,480
Fuck you.
Fuck yeah.

4420
03:01:16,481 --> 03:01:17,410
Fuck you.
You're rolling.

4421
03:01:17,530 --> 03:01:21,040
We'd never had like more of an open 
forum for debating ideas,

4422
03:01:21,041 --> 03:01:21,874
but people have never been more dogmatic
and aggressive about their opinions too 

4423
03:01:25,360 --> 03:01:26,193
and the left gets violent.
Now this is a weird thing that didn't 

4424
03:01:28,811 --> 03:01:29,644
use to happen before.
Like Shun Nick Depaulo get punched in 

4425
03:01:31,151 --> 03:01:31,984
the face by some woman at a show self 
righteous that you feel like he has had 

4426
03:01:35,231 --> 03:01:36,064
a punch him in the face,
got a giant black eye and it's like you 

4427
03:01:38,111 --> 03:01:40,780
can't be violent against someone.
And they use ago,

4428
03:01:40,840 --> 03:01:41,673
we'll look who you're,
let's say it was like a dice type act 

4429
03:01:44,440 --> 03:01:47,950
and then some of those people were like 
hardcore kkk pepper people like look who

4430
03:01:47,951 --> 03:01:49,660
your fan base is and you're like,
that's not my fault.

4431
03:01:49,660 --> 03:01:52,720
I'm not going to be there.
Well if you want that logic,

4432
03:01:53,200 --> 03:01:55,630
some of the people following you guys 
are pretty fucking shitty.

4433
03:01:55,900 --> 03:01:56,733
Yeah.
I will call you on that logic cause I'm 

4434
03:01:57,521 --> 03:01:59,650
not a hypocrite but like it ain't your 
fault.

4435
03:01:59,651 --> 03:02:03,580
But like they are.
Some of them are getting fucking violent

4436
03:02:03,581 --> 03:02:04,414
now.
Yeah,

4437
03:02:04,570 --> 03:02:06,720
it's crazy.
So antifreeze page,

4438
03:02:06,820 --> 03:02:08,740
it's,
it's so much of information.

4439
03:02:08,800 --> 03:02:12,340
It becomes idea wars and when it becomes
idea wars they'd get this.

4440
03:02:12,341 --> 03:02:13,174
Anything necessary by any means 
necessary mentality and they think that 

4441
03:02:16,621 --> 03:02:17,454
sometimes justify the means.
It's fucking professors out there had 

4442
03:02:19,421 --> 03:02:20,254
been quoted to saying that they believe 
in violence when there is no other 

4443
03:02:23,081 --> 03:02:23,914
solution supporting Antifa.
Antifa is disruptive violence and to 

4444
03:02:27,740 --> 03:02:30,550
take away a pressers and that free,
this is a big one.

4445
03:02:30,551 --> 03:02:32,530
This is one that has been coming up 
lately more,

4446
03:02:32,560 --> 03:02:34,030
more often.
Even the ACL,

4447
03:02:34,031 --> 03:02:37,200
you change his stance on free speech and
they,

4448
03:02:37,201 --> 03:02:39,610
they,
they're deeming free speech is something

4449
03:02:39,611 --> 03:02:41,860
that's not hurtful to someone else.

4450
03:02:42,220 --> 03:02:43,600
Well,
that's not what free speech is.

4451
03:02:43,601 --> 03:02:47,980
Like what is the most recent,
most recent reading about free speech?

4452
03:02:48,010 --> 03:02:51,040
There's something about the Eclu stance 
on free speech,

4453
03:02:51,060 --> 03:02:51,893
but you can't in French,
my belief is you can't fringe on their 

4454
03:02:54,110 --> 03:02:56,380
such fine as long as you don't fringe on
the rights of someone else.

4455
03:02:56,410 --> 03:02:58,450
Right.
So like you can burn a flag if you want,

4456
03:02:58,451 --> 03:03:00,280
but you can't burn a flag in my 
apartment.

4457
03:03:00,730 --> 03:03:01,563
I don't think.
I think they're shifting concern right 

4458
03:03:03,820 --> 03:03:06,460
through to what harm is.
It's a gorgeous looking at physical harm

4459
03:03:06,461 --> 03:03:09,610
or monetary and physical or not.
We talk about like slight mental harm.

4460
03:03:10,150 --> 03:03:11,530
Well,
if it's racism,

4461
03:03:11,531 --> 03:03:14,320
it's clearly emotional harm,
mental harm.

4462
03:03:14,430 --> 03:03:15,263
You're,
you're damaging someone's psyche if 

4463
03:03:16,600 --> 03:03:17,433
you're dismissing them in a racist way 
or you're insulting them in a racist 

4464
03:03:20,831 --> 03:03:21,664
way.
I think that's one of the things not 

4465
03:03:23,030 --> 03:03:24,010
wanting to white people.

4466
03:03:24,640 --> 03:03:25,870
Here's the problem with sec.
Okay.

4467
03:03:25,871 --> 03:03:30,130
So I heard this theory that like making 
fun of white people and dismissing Ypo.

4468
03:03:30,770 --> 03:03:31,840
Yeah.
Fuck you white guy.

4469
03:03:31,841 --> 03:03:32,830
You don't know anything.
All right,

4470
03:03:32,831 --> 03:03:33,664
well that's,
you've just put me into a category that 

4471
03:03:34,801 --> 03:03:35,470
I'm in.
Just race,

4472
03:03:35,470 --> 03:03:36,370
human.
I mean,

4473
03:03:36,371 --> 03:03:37,930
I know you don't like when people do 
that til he was.

4474
03:03:37,931 --> 03:03:39,850
So I don't know why you're using those 
methods now.

4475
03:03:39,880 --> 03:03:40,990
Does it make sense to me?
Well,

4476
03:03:40,991 --> 03:03:43,190
it's the tide coming in and out right 
there.

4477
03:03:43,210 --> 03:03:47,770
The whites owned slaves for so long and 
it was so fucking oppressive that now as

4478
03:03:47,771 --> 03:03:48,604
it's shifted back,
there's still economic despair and all 

4479
03:03:50,681 --> 03:03:53,860
black neighborhoods because of racist 
laws and things have bounced out yet.

4480
03:03:53,980 --> 03:03:56,140
So you're allowed to go fuck white 
people.

4481
03:03:56,380 --> 03:03:58,070
So you're allowed to fuck white people 
until

4482
03:03:58,070 --> 03:03:58,903
it goes this way and this way.
And then he got to the point where you 

4483
03:04:00,741 --> 03:04:02,270
shitting on Christians and I'm not a 
Christian.

4484
03:04:02,271 --> 03:04:03,620
I don't care for them.
Uh,

4485
03:04:03,650 --> 03:04:05,960
especially Catholics,
but like we're shitting on them now.

4486
03:04:05,961 --> 03:04:06,381
It's like,
Hey,

4487
03:04:06,381 --> 03:04:08,960
can you come on and leave them alone?
They're honestly,

4488
03:04:08,961 --> 03:04:10,130
all they do is take abuse.
Now,

4489
03:04:10,160 --> 03:04:10,993
all they're doing is trying to worship 
their God and you guys are shitting on 

4490
03:04:12,951 --> 03:04:16,010
them and calling them yokels and leave 
them alone for a minute.

4491
03:04:16,030 --> 03:04:16,380
They're,
they,

4492
03:04:16,380 --> 03:04:17,570
they're down.
They're down.

4493
03:04:17,600 --> 03:04:19,680
You've got them down.
You're not punching down if you want,

4494
03:04:19,860 --> 03:04:21,800
if you want to shit it on a Catholic.
Yeah.

4495
03:04:21,801 --> 03:04:25,310
Unless they're fucking kids.
Do whatever.

4496
03:04:25,311 --> 03:04:26,121
You will join it.
Wait,

4497
03:04:26,121 --> 03:04:26,740
wait.
Do Yo know,

4498
03:04:26,740 --> 03:04:29,390
right.
Well you said what you said that is,

4499
03:04:29,680 --> 03:04:30,513
I mean,
that is one of the darkest fucking 

4500
03:04:31,551 --> 03:04:35,780
thinks that they're accused transfer and
people go rapes all over the place.

4501
03:04:35,810 --> 03:04:37,310
That was the pope.
Pope did that.

4502
03:04:37,360 --> 03:04:38,193
Yeah.
Here's an organized guy who talks to 

4503
03:04:39,290 --> 03:04:40,490
God.
That's what,

4504
03:04:40,630 --> 03:04:41,463
that's what God told him to say.
And he moves somebody who went on to 

4505
03:04:43,281 --> 03:04:47,040
rape a hundred deaf kids.
Yeah.

4506
03:04:47,930 --> 03:04:48,763
Yeah.

4507
03:04:48,810 --> 03:04:49,643
Hundred.

4508
03:04:50,720 --> 03:04:51,553
Okay.
Yeah.

4509
03:04:52,070 --> 03:04:52,903
Um,

4510
03:04:53,240 --> 03:04:54,590
what the fuck,
man.

4511
03:04:54,660 --> 03:04:58,000
You look into that guy's background,
ratzinger and look into it.

4512
03:04:58,001 --> 03:04:59,510
I mean,
there's several cases of that.

4513
03:04:59,540 --> 03:05:01,400
There's so many,
there's documentaries on it,

4514
03:05:01,490 --> 03:05:02,323
I think.
Speak no evil is one of the 

4515
03:05:02,781 --> 03:05:03,614
documentaries of a different priests 
that were just molesting just scores of 

4516
03:05:07,911 --> 03:05:09,760
kids.
Damn.

4517
03:05:09,850 --> 03:05:11,020
Yeah.
And they interviewed the guys.

4518
03:05:11,080 --> 03:05:12,790
They're monsters.
It's so crazy,

4519
03:05:12,791 --> 03:05:13,900
man.
They were just,

4520
03:05:13,901 --> 03:05:16,060
that's what they did.
That's what everybody did to them.

4521
03:05:16,210 --> 03:05:17,620
That's what they did.
And they got away with it

4522
03:05:17,670 --> 03:05:19,560
forever.
If we once in a while someone will point

4523
03:05:19,561 --> 03:05:23,190
out some like Jewish rabbi that like has
raped a kid or something like that.

4524
03:05:23,220 --> 03:05:25,750
As I see it happens in Judaism to okay,

4525
03:05:26,010 --> 03:05:26,843
what does this acl use?
Longstanding commitment to defending 

4526
03:05:28,381 --> 03:05:29,214
speech we hate is this recent good.
That's what they should be doing in 

4527
03:05:30,991 --> 03:05:33,920
response to this.
Oh,

4528
03:05:33,921 --> 03:05:34,754
so somebody published a someone's 
criticism published in the Wall Street 

4529
03:05:37,880 --> 03:05:38,780
Journal,
uh,

4530
03:05:38,810 --> 03:05:40,880
is different from those challenges to 
our work.

4531
03:05:40,881 --> 03:05:43,130
Her critique is pr is predicted.
Oh,

4532
03:05:43,131 --> 03:05:45,110
predicated on a fundamental 
misrepresentation.

4533
03:05:45,111 --> 03:05:45,944
She falsely accused of the Acl,
you of having secretly changes policy 

4534
03:05:48,891 --> 03:05:49,724
and regarding free speech and of 
launching an investigation to determine 

4535
03:05:52,761 --> 03:05:54,570
who leaked the secret.
Uh,

4536
03:05:54,650 --> 03:05:59,630
air quotes leaked and then quote,
secret document that she claims revealed

4537
03:05:59,631 --> 03:06:01,580
this asserted change in policy.
In fact,

4538
03:06:01,581 --> 03:06:06,440
the Aclu remains fully committed to 
defending free speech as a document.

4539
03:06:06,441 --> 03:06:09,550
She cites expressly with firms 
expressing reforms.

4540
03:06:09,720 --> 03:06:10,970
Um,
Hashtag fake news.

4541
03:06:11,030 --> 03:06:13,970
So somebody put out some fake news 
according to the Aclu.

4542
03:06:14,060 --> 03:06:14,400
Good.

4543
03:06:14,400 --> 03:06:16,000
I heard somebody say,
it's hard to tell.

4544
03:06:16,200 --> 03:06:17,580
You should not be able to,
uh,

4545
03:06:17,720 --> 03:06:18,553
this was like on a fucking something and
say once there's violence committed 

4546
03:06:22,441 --> 03:06:23,670
because of your,
um,

4547
03:06:23,880 --> 03:06:24,713
organization,
you can no longer say you're not a 

4548
03:06:26,281 --> 03:06:29,700
terrorist organization where you can no 
longer say you have the right to protest

4549
03:06:29,701 --> 03:06:32,280
when it causes violence.
And then this was on npr actually,

4550
03:06:32,281 --> 03:06:33,390
and then the coast was like,
okay,

4551
03:06:33,391 --> 03:06:34,890
so just so you know though,
under the,

4552
03:06:34,891 --> 03:06:37,620
and there are liberal group,
I'm not crazy,

4553
03:06:37,621 --> 03:06:39,820
but like liberal arts.
Okay.

4554
03:06:39,840 --> 03:06:40,673
Just so you know.
Then they'll apply that same thing to a 

4555
03:06:42,540 --> 03:06:44,220
black lives matter.
And he's like,

4556
03:06:44,221 --> 03:06:44,881
what do you mean?
Like,

4557
03:06:44,881 --> 03:06:45,714
well,
that guy who killed two cops because of 

4558
03:06:46,561 --> 03:06:47,394
the black lives matter.
If,

4559
03:06:47,400 --> 03:06:50,580
if you're going to say the followers 
decide whether or not it's,

4560
03:06:50,581 --> 03:06:52,530
then we have to outlaw of black lives 
matter.

4561
03:06:52,531 --> 03:06:53,580
And that guy was like,
oh,

4562
03:06:53,850 --> 03:06:54,501
no,
no,

4563
03:06:54,501 --> 03:06:54,751
no,
no,

4564
03:06:54,751 --> 03:06:55,110
no,
no.

4565
03:06:55,110 --> 03:06:55,741
Can't do that.
I was like,

4566
03:06:55,741 --> 03:06:56,040
all right,
well

4567
03:06:56,040 --> 03:06:56,873
then you can't say Charlottesville.
People don't have a right to say go 

4568
03:06:58,951 --> 03:07:00,630
home.
Kikes you're taking our jobs.

4569
03:07:01,590 --> 03:07:02,460
They can say it.
It's fine.

4570
03:07:02,490 --> 03:07:03,450
They can say it.
It sucks.

4571
03:07:03,480 --> 03:07:05,010
They can say it.
Yeah.

4572
03:07:06,870 --> 03:07:08,190
All of it.
You've got to say all of it.

4573
03:07:08,550 --> 03:07:10,680
You can even roll your eyes and say,
that guy's an idiot.

4574
03:07:10,770 --> 03:07:13,830
That's your right.
You don't stop them from talking because

4575
03:07:13,831 --> 03:07:14,664
then it keeps going to the point where 
rap is getting fucking boycotted in 

4576
03:07:19,441 --> 03:07:21,510
America.
You can't put your shit out.

4577
03:07:21,900 --> 03:07:22,733
It goes.
It will always go to a point where it'd 

4578
03:07:24,541 --> 03:07:26,850
be super,
super repressive.

4579
03:07:27,810 --> 03:07:28,643
Well,
if one person who is not doing anything 

4580
03:07:30,721 --> 03:07:32,730
wrong can't speak,
you've done something wrong.

4581
03:07:33,150 --> 03:07:33,983
You could easily compromise a group two 
and turn it into a terrorist 

4582
03:07:36,900 --> 03:07:37,733
organization by infiltrating it,
having someone caused violence and it 

4583
03:07:40,810 --> 03:07:42,210
did occupy Wall Street.
Exactly what?

4584
03:07:42,220 --> 03:07:43,053
Sending some undercover cops start fist 
fights and then they get brought that I 

4585
03:07:45,091 --> 03:07:46,680
could go home this fist fights now.

4586
03:07:46,960 --> 03:07:49,320
Yeah.
Kids that were hanging around in occupy,

4587
03:07:49,321 --> 03:07:50,154
we're saying that they would run into 
undercover agents and undercover cops 

4588
03:07:53,130 --> 03:07:54,240
all day,
but would,

4589
03:07:54,241 --> 03:07:56,730
the guys they knew were undercover and 
they're like,

4590
03:07:56,731 --> 03:07:57,564
what the fuck?
So they're just like being overwhelmed 

4591
03:08:00,061 --> 03:08:04,080
by people who are lying to them.
And for the government to keep the peace

4592
03:08:04,081 --> 03:08:04,914
like this,
they're like secret covert agents 

4593
03:08:06,001 --> 03:08:07,950
hanging around with these occupied kids.
Yeah.

4594
03:08:08,200 --> 03:08:09,300
You know,
you ever see,

4595
03:08:10,080 --> 03:08:12,150
one of my favorites is when Peter 
Schiff,

4596
03:08:12,390 --> 03:08:15,540
who the venture capitalists banker,
Genius Guy.

4597
03:08:15,541 --> 03:08:18,300
Have you ever seen Peter Schiff been on 
my podcast a few times,

4598
03:08:18,360 --> 03:08:21,090
super wealthy,
successful business guy.

4599
03:08:21,360 --> 03:08:22,193
And uh,
he went down to occupy Wall Street and 

4600
03:08:24,481 --> 03:08:25,314
he said,
uh,

4601
03:08:25,470 --> 03:08:27,840
I don't know how he sat up.
I'm a multimillionaire.

4602
03:08:27,841 --> 03:08:28,674
Come,
uh,

4603
03:08:28,950 --> 03:08:29,783
uh,
explained to me what I've done wrong or 

4604
03:08:31,800 --> 03:08:35,430
something along those ways are I,
I forget what his actual,

4605
03:08:35,490 --> 03:08:36,020
that's fun.

4606
03:08:36,020 --> 03:08:38,220
That's a patrol.
What was a great troll?

4607
03:08:38,221 --> 03:08:39,054
Because he's a financial genius.
He understands the market inside and 

4608
03:08:41,101 --> 03:08:41,934
out.
They don't know what the fuck they're 

4609
03:08:42,421 --> 03:08:43,290
talking about.
And he's like,

4610
03:08:43,291 --> 03:08:43,710
look,
I,

4611
03:08:43,710 --> 03:08:45,630
I employ hundreds of people.
I have a,

4612
03:08:45,760 --> 03:08:47,910
an enormous business.
I make tremendous amount of capital.

4613
03:08:47,911 --> 03:08:50,010
Why should you make the same amount of 
money as me?

4614
03:08:50,370 --> 03:08:51,203
And she's fucking tortures these people 
because he speaks a fucking hundred and 

4615
03:08:54,691 --> 03:08:55,524
50 miles an hour.
And they don't know what they're saying 

4616
03:08:56,851 --> 03:08:58,040
and he's just,
he's,

4617
03:08:58,100 --> 03:08:58,933
it's,
it's very comical to watch and it just 

4618
03:09:00,271 --> 03:09:01,104
shows you how people go into these 
things with these idealistic ideas of 

4619
03:09:05,011 --> 03:09:05,844
what they think they're standing for 
when they don't even have like a 

4620
03:09:07,741 --> 03:09:08,574
framework of what they're against.
The policies and the banking and the 

4621
03:09:11,911 --> 03:09:14,460
corporations and capitalism in general.
They don't have a,

4622
03:09:14,640 --> 03:09:17,400
there's so many people that do,
but most people don't.

4623
03:09:17,430 --> 03:09:19,140
Most people that are there,
they're there for the ride.

4624
03:09:20,900 --> 03:09:21,733
It's like,
okay,

4625
03:09:21,810 --> 03:09:24,360
fuck the man man,
you're going to fix things.

4626
03:09:24,430 --> 03:09:25,263
So Peter Schiff is the man so he gets 
out there amongst them with fucking 

4627
03:09:28,021 --> 03:09:29,850
beautiful $5,000
suit on.

4628
03:09:30,140 --> 03:09:31,680
It probably costs more than Nice.
Probably angry.

4629
03:09:31,950 --> 03:09:32,783
And right now,
I mean you can watch these videos on 

4630
03:09:34,891 --> 03:09:36,000
youtube.
They're hilarious.

4631
03:09:36,390 --> 03:09:37,770
That's great.
He,

4632
03:09:37,860 --> 03:09:38,693
I want to talk to him cause he set up 
shop in Puerto Rico right before the 

4633
03:09:41,971 --> 03:09:43,860
hurricanes came and shut all the power 
off.

4634
03:09:44,310 --> 03:09:45,143
He was living in Puerto Rico.
Apparently a lot of people move to 

4635
03:09:46,831 --> 03:09:50,520
Puerto Rico.
Not all rich people because fuck this.

4636
03:09:50,550 --> 03:09:51,383
Yeah.
Because the tax is there just like 

4637
03:09:52,081 --> 03:09:54,880
stupid low.
My friend has lived there.

4638
03:09:55,030 --> 03:09:55,863
Yeah.
Susie,

4639
03:09:55,950 --> 03:09:56,783
um,
went to college together and she's like 

4640
03:09:58,960 --> 03:09:59,793
the power like really in the last month 
or two just came back on and it's being 

4641
03:10:02,801 --> 03:10:05,650
held on by a bandaid and it,
hurricane season is starting soon.

4642
03:10:05,650 --> 03:10:07,300
Hurricane season.
Oh No.

4643
03:10:07,330 --> 03:10:09,100
It's like,
it's just going to happen again.

4644
03:10:09,700 --> 03:10:12,430
So how long has the power out for months
and months.

4645
03:10:12,490 --> 03:10:13,323
Oh my God.
And they got it back in few places and 

4646
03:10:14,621 --> 03:10:17,350
then it kept going in other places 
people died because of lack of power.

4647
03:10:17,620 --> 03:10:19,480
No,
we ain't doing shit,

4648
03:10:19,930 --> 03:10:23,500
but it's what is in the eyes of regular 
people.

4649
03:10:23,830 --> 03:10:26,230
Like most Americans are busy with their 
regular lives.

4650
03:10:26,890 --> 03:10:28,990
Puerto Rico's not a part of us,
even though it is.

4651
03:10:28,991 --> 03:10:29,501
Yeah.
I love it.

4652
03:10:29,501 --> 03:10:30,071
Everybody's like,
Oh,

4653
03:10:30,071 --> 03:10:31,140
you idiot trump.
Uh,

4654
03:10:31,240 --> 03:10:33,610
Puerto Rico is part of America is part 
of America.

4655
03:10:33,611 --> 03:10:34,450
And I remember he like,
yeah,

4656
03:10:34,451 --> 03:10:35,284
you just found this out right now.
I knew it was because I used to have a 

4657
03:10:38,561 --> 03:10:40,570
joke about Alaska being a frozen Puerto 
Rico.

4658
03:10:40,620 --> 03:10:42,220
Oh,
let's not even attached.

4659
03:10:42,280 --> 03:10:43,300
Like,
how has that ours,

4660
03:10:43,360 --> 03:10:45,820
and that was Hawaii are so fucking place
way over there.

4661
03:10:45,850 --> 03:10:47,350
But yeah,
all the power goes out in Alaska.

4662
03:10:47,351 --> 03:10:48,430
We keep helping them.
Right.

4663
03:10:49,020 --> 03:10:53,110
What do we look at it if it's not a 
state cause before he goes,

4664
03:10:53,111 --> 03:10:55,420
not a stage four because they're Puerto 
Rican is part of it.

4665
03:10:56,470 --> 03:10:58,630
They always want to do this too in that 
backlash on things.

4666
03:10:58,631 --> 03:10:59,464
They want to narrow it down to one 
possible thing and it's like it ain't 

4667
03:11:01,341 --> 03:11:02,174
one possible thing.
It's you have to give it up for all of 

4668
03:11:04,121 --> 03:11:04,720
it.
Right.

4669
03:11:04,720 --> 03:11:05,770
You know?
Yes.

4670
03:11:05,771 --> 03:11:09,070
Perhaps it's because they're not white 
because they're Latino ish.

4671
03:11:09,390 --> 03:11:10,223
Uh,
perhaps it's also mixed in with the ads 

4672
03:11:11,651 --> 03:11:12,484
are not a full state wish.
I knew enough about finances to ask the 

4673
03:11:15,341 --> 03:11:18,010
question,
is it possible that the reason why these

4674
03:11:18,011 --> 03:11:21,490
corporations and these rich dudes wants 
a movie wants to move there and,

4675
03:11:21,880 --> 03:11:26,680
and get such a low tax rate that they 
have to pay is also why they didn't have

4676
03:11:26,681 --> 03:11:30,190
the money to recover from this 
infrastructure being down.

4677
03:11:30,580 --> 03:11:33,310
And so that these two might somehow or 
another be correlated,

4678
03:11:33,340 --> 03:11:34,173
or is it just that,
that the hurricane was so fucking 

4679
03:11:36,881 --> 03:11:40,510
overwhelmingly devastating that it just 
took forever to fix?

4680
03:11:41,380 --> 03:11:42,213
Which one is it?
Because anybody who thinks you don't 

4681
03:11:43,961 --> 03:11:44,794
need government,
we have to sit down and talk about how 

4682
03:11:47,351 --> 03:11:50,140
we're going to fix things.
We're going to have to sit down and talk

4683
03:11:50,141 --> 03:11:52,840
about infrastructure.
We have some local government,

4684
03:11:52,841 --> 03:11:53,950
but you would,
what does that mean?

4685
03:11:53,951 --> 03:11:56,020
Like there's no government.
People are crazy.

4686
03:11:56,050 --> 03:11:58,630
Today in Puerto Rico,
nine months after Hurricane Maria,

4687
03:11:58,631 --> 03:12:01,960
2,609
six 2,669

4688
03:12:01,961 --> 03:12:04,810
customers still do not have power.
In many cases,

4689
03:12:05,020 --> 03:12:09,460
these homes were more than one or where 
more than one person lives.

4690
03:12:09,461 --> 03:12:12,190
It may be another months before they get
it.

4691
03:12:12,550 --> 03:12:15,580
We're going to tweet about this until 
the last customer has power.

4692
03:12:15,730 --> 03:12:16,660
And this is,
uh,

4693
03:12:16,690 --> 03:12:17,590

U.
D.

4702
03:12:28,900 --> 03:12:33,900
How big is that?
A French real big hell from Louisiana.

4703
03:12:34,360 --> 03:12:36,340
They've been y'all.
That's fucking crazy.

4704
03:12:37,000 --> 03:12:40,140
Nine months after the hurricane,
the hurricanes are coming again.

4705
03:12:40,200 --> 03:12:44,470
That comment there.
Fuck didn't,

4706
03:12:44,500 --> 03:12:46,090
I'm sorry Susan.
Which dude?

4707
03:12:46,240 --> 03:12:47,073
Branson.
Didn't he buy an island that goes got 

4708
03:12:48,641 --> 03:12:50,320
completely decimated?
I think so.

4709
03:12:50,321 --> 03:12:53,360
I think the whole island got wiped off 
the face of the map.

4710
03:12:53,870 --> 03:12:56,120
I think there's for the first time and 
like 300 years.

4711
03:12:56,121 --> 03:13:00,590
No human beings live on an island too,
dude.

4712
03:13:01,160 --> 03:13:01,993
What the fuck you imagine living in a 
place where the sky becomes an angry 

4713
03:13:05,811 --> 03:13:06,644
monster and just rips houses apart.
You should have seen some of these 

4714
03:13:09,741 --> 03:13:13,100
fucking torrential rains and like his 
team orange it like that where it's like

4715
03:13:13,101 --> 03:13:15,830
it's going in like oh drop job,
get to cover now.

4716
03:13:16,010 --> 03:13:18,110
And if you don't get to cover in a 
minute,

4717
03:13:18,260 --> 03:13:19,490
your underwear soaked.

4718
03:13:19,720 --> 03:13:23,990
I mean is through you.
All your stuff is ruined too.

4719
03:13:24,050 --> 03:13:28,820
And then it passes in like 30 minutes.
Do you remember when we were in Miami?

4720
03:13:28,821 --> 03:13:31,840
Will you with me when we,
when Eddie Bravo was doing a seminar and

4721
03:13:31,850 --> 03:13:32,683
we drove down from West Palm Beach to 
Miami and we had a stop on the highway 

4722
03:13:36,730 --> 03:13:38,510
too much.
There was so much rain.

4723
03:13:38,511 --> 03:13:41,540
All car stopped on the highway,
this ranch,

4724
03:13:42,170 --> 03:13:43,003
it was fucking crazy and all I could 
think of is I hope no asshole tries to 

4725
03:13:46,041 --> 03:13:48,380
drive through this 60th.
That's pretty limited.

4726
03:13:48,381 --> 03:13:51,460
I can just fucking fucking calm.
I'm coke.

4727
03:13:53,990 --> 03:13:54,823
It was insane.
We had to stay put and it was a wall of 

4728
03:13:56,991 --> 03:14:00,050
water around us everywhere we looked.
Fuck man.

4729
03:14:01,220 --> 03:14:02,390
That was insane.
Yeah.

4730
03:14:04,940 --> 03:14:08,240
Damn.
That's a crazy thing about this world is

4731
03:14:08,241 --> 03:14:11,240
that you go to different places and just
by the universe pot,

4732
03:14:11,241 --> 03:14:14,330
you're at earthquakes and south places,
hurricanes and others.

4733
03:14:14,400 --> 03:14:16,850
I can pay attention to why.
No,

4734
03:14:16,880 --> 03:14:19,190
they're losing hundreds and hundreds of 
houses to the volcano.

4735
03:14:19,220 --> 03:14:20,220
The volcano.
Really?

4736
03:14:20,221 --> 03:14:22,030
That's how the piano,
dude,

4737
03:14:22,040 --> 03:14:23,500
it's fucking up like a one time thing.
You,

4738
03:14:23,570 --> 03:14:26,000
it's fucking up everything and they say 
it could go on for months.

4739
03:14:26,480 --> 03:14:28,460
It,
they have projectiles flying through the

4740
03:14:28,461 --> 03:14:29,294
air that are like s like fucking several
hundred pound rock Laogai hurling 

4741
03:14:32,901 --> 03:14:35,510
through the air and landing on shit and 
lighting things on fire.

4742
03:14:35,960 --> 03:14:36,691
Yeah,
dude,

4743
03:14:36,691 --> 03:14:39,200
they're losing houses left and right.
They can't stop it.

4744
03:14:39,201 --> 03:14:40,034
They came and slow it down.
You just have to get out of there so 

4745
03:14:42,141 --> 03:14:43,250
they just have to evacuate.

4746
03:14:43,250 --> 03:14:47,180
This toxic fumes in the air is all all 
around where the volcanoes are.

4747
03:14:47,600 --> 03:14:48,970
Look at it,
which,

4748
03:14:49,010 --> 03:14:51,980
which island or could see it from space.
Oh my God.

4749
03:14:52,820 --> 03:14:55,940
That's fucking space,
bitch.

4750
03:14:56,150 --> 03:14:56,921
Look at it.
What is it?

4751
03:14:56,921 --> 03:14:58,070
The main island.
The big one.

4752
03:14:58,130 --> 03:14:59,000
Wow.
Yeah,

4753
03:14:59,001 --> 03:15:00,530
the big island dude.
It's huge.

4754
03:15:01,130 --> 03:15:04,700
It's a fucking real problem.
Wow.

4755
03:15:04,790 --> 03:15:05,580
Yeah.
Look at that.

4756
03:15:05,580 --> 03:15:07,280
We'll go to scroll back up to the last 
one.

4757
03:15:07,430 --> 03:15:08,900
That one right?
They look at that shit.

4758
03:15:09,410 --> 03:15:12,440
We're looking at this insane ocean.
Beautiful image.

4759
03:15:12,441 --> 03:15:13,274
It's on Forbes.
It's a beautiful image of how green and 

4760
03:15:15,561 --> 03:15:16,394
lush,
the Big Island looks beautiful for 90% 

4761
03:15:18,591 --> 03:15:19,424
of the patients and amazing.
But this lava is shooting out of it and 

4762
03:15:22,851 --> 03:15:24,920
it's quit a people live.
Well,

4763
03:15:24,921 --> 03:15:26,780
this house has warehouses down there,
so,

4764
03:15:26,781 --> 03:15:30,380
so one thing that all that stuff to the 
left,

4765
03:15:30,410 --> 03:15:32,210
that little brown shit,
that's like a little village.

4766
03:15:32,690 --> 03:15:35,210
A lot of those houses.
Yeah,

4767
03:15:35,211 --> 03:15:37,010
I saw it eat that Mustang.
That must've,

4768
03:15:37,020 --> 03:15:37,940
yeah,
that was cool.

4769
03:15:38,130 --> 03:15:39,590
Yeah.
The Mustang got cooked.

4770
03:15:39,591 --> 03:15:41,810
It was weird.
It was weird.

4771
03:15:41,840 --> 03:15:44,450
Just watching it consume it.
Like that's it.

4772
03:15:44,451 --> 03:15:45,284
You're so much,
that kind of nature is so amazing that 

4773
03:15:47,631 --> 03:15:48,464
people

4774
03:15:48,590 --> 03:15:50,100
with,
that's how

4775
03:15:50,100 --> 03:15:51,930
you get an island.
So yeah,

4776
03:15:52,090 --> 03:15:54,390
exactly.
That's Iceland is all volcanic rock.

4777
03:15:54,391 --> 03:15:57,600
And then just sort of going over the top
of it and just stuff grew out of it.

4778
03:15:57,601 --> 03:15:58,434
Yeah.
I mean that is literally how the Big 

4779
03:16:00,361 --> 03:16:01,194
island was formed.
It's being formed right now and you 

4780
03:16:02,771 --> 03:16:04,650
freaking out,
you're going to have extension.

4781
03:16:04,680 --> 03:16:06,180
If I can calm down,
it's gotta be bigger.

4782
03:16:06,240 --> 03:16:07,073
Yeah.
Hawaii is going to be bigger and you've 

4783
03:16:08,201 --> 03:16:09,990
got to put some tarp while you're 
fucking building shit.

4784
03:16:10,050 --> 03:16:12,420
They have this shit there.
They call vog.

4785
03:16:12,480 --> 03:16:15,000
It's like volcanic smog.
Yeah,

4786
03:16:15,001 --> 03:16:15,670
man.
Uh,

4787
03:16:15,670 --> 03:16:17,460
it really fucked with my daughter's 
head.

4788
03:16:17,490 --> 03:16:18,370
Um,
she gets a,

4789
03:16:19,770 --> 03:16:22,260
she was sneezing and coughing and I was 
like,

4790
03:16:22,261 --> 03:16:24,840
what's the matter?
And they said for some people,

4791
03:16:24,841 --> 03:16:26,820
if they have allergies to certain 
allergies,

4792
03:16:27,090 --> 03:16:29,700
um,
you can get this dog,

4793
03:16:29,760 --> 03:16:34,050
this weird fucking fog that comes in 
that's mixed with volcanic,

4794
03:16:34,051 --> 03:16:35,440
volcanic,
uh,

4795
03:16:35,820 --> 03:16:37,570
either admissions or,
you know,

4796
03:16:37,740 --> 03:16:40,350
there's a lot of,
a lot of stuff that these people were in

4797
03:16:40,351 --> 03:16:42,420
danger of is not just the volcano 
itself,

4798
03:16:42,421 --> 03:16:43,650
but the toxic gas.

4799
03:16:43,680 --> 03:16:44,513
Yeah.
And so some of those gases that leak 

4800
03:16:46,261 --> 03:16:47,094
from the volcano get in the fog and some
people are particularly susceptible to 

4801
03:16:49,861 --> 03:16:50,580
it.
Yeah,

4802
03:16:50,580 --> 03:16:52,530
I remember that European one where 
everybody was like,

4803
03:16:52,531 --> 03:16:54,780
all the crops are ruined.
Oh yeah.

4804
03:16:54,810 --> 03:16:56,690
Was that the Iceland one where they,
do you know,

4805
03:16:56,720 --> 03:16:57,553
that's the one that was,
that was the one that was responsible 

4806
03:17:00,361 --> 03:17:03,240
for that Michael Hastings guy.
Do you know Michael Hastings?

4807
03:17:03,241 --> 03:17:05,370
He's that journalist that they,
his career?

4808
03:17:05,430 --> 03:17:05,911
No,
no,

4809
03:17:05,911 --> 03:17:06,300
no,
no.

4810
03:17:06,300 --> 03:17:07,133
He was over there doing a story on a 
general for rolling stone and they had 

4811
03:17:12,631 --> 03:17:15,510
the volcano happen and he couldn't fly 
home for a long time.

4812
03:17:15,720 --> 03:17:18,390
So he's over there embedded with the 
soldiers for a long period of time.

4813
03:17:18,391 --> 03:17:20,160
And during that time they got a little 
loose with them.

4814
03:17:20,580 --> 03:17:22,890
And started being themselves and you 
know,

4815
03:17:22,950 --> 03:17:25,680
some general said some stupid shit about
Obama,

4816
03:17:25,681 --> 03:17:26,514
you know,
insulted them in some way and they got 

4817
03:17:27,781 --> 03:17:29,800
this and I still write general,
no,

4818
03:17:29,801 --> 03:17:31,890
no,
no US general because this guy was doing

4819
03:17:31,891 --> 03:17:34,560
a story overseas and as he was doing the
story overseas,

4820
03:17:34,680 --> 03:17:36,450
he got stranded there because of the 
volcano.

4821
03:17:37,380 --> 03:17:38,380
So Michael Hastings,
right,

4822
03:17:38,400 --> 03:17:43,400
this very bad story about this general 
and then comes back and you know,

4823
03:17:43,801 --> 03:17:45,480
the general gets fired.
Uh,

4824
03:17:45,510 --> 03:17:48,000
he,
he loses his job and he's like a beloved

4825
03:17:48,001 --> 03:17:48,834
general.
And so Michael Hastings then winds up 

4826
03:17:51,451 --> 03:17:56,451
driving his fucking car into a tree,
going 120 miles an hour on sunset.

4827
03:17:56,970 --> 03:17:57,803
And the,
the fear was that someone had murked 

4828
03:18:00,661 --> 03:18:01,494
him.
What they had done is they had hired 

4829
03:18:02,941 --> 03:18:03,774
someone to take over his car because 
he's got one of them modern Mercedes 

4830
03:18:07,981 --> 03:18:08,814
where it just hack into an hack into it.
You could force those things to drive 

4831
03:18:10,681 --> 03:18:11,720
themselves.
You could do,

4832
03:18:11,910 --> 03:18:14,100
you could literally get into the 
computer and turn,

4833
03:18:14,101 --> 03:18:14,934
shift the wheel.
A hastings found himself on a bus from 

4834
03:18:17,731 --> 03:18:19,860
parents to Berlin with mcchrystal and 
his entourage.

4835
03:18:19,861 --> 03:18:20,694
The visit,
which was supposed to take place in two 

4836
03:18:21,541 --> 03:18:22,374
days,
turned into a month during which time 

4837
03:18:23,821 --> 03:18:26,220
hastings had considerable access to the 
general.

4838
03:18:26,490 --> 03:18:27,323
So the,
the big conspiracy theory was that he 

4839
03:18:30,840 --> 03:18:31,673
was murdered.
That was the big conspiracy because his 

4840
03:18:33,241 --> 03:18:36,360
car,
the engine flew from the car.

4841
03:18:36,600 --> 03:18:38,250
I mean it was like,
it exploded,

4842
03:18:38,550 --> 03:18:40,230
like to do some sort of explosion in 
there.

4843
03:18:40,290 --> 03:18:44,910
And then there was also the toxicology 
examine toxicology examination,

4844
03:18:45,090 --> 03:18:46,950
I'm pretty sure revealed we looking for 
the,

4845
03:18:47,680 --> 03:18:50,950
revealed that he was a on some sort of 
amphetamine,

4846
03:18:51,040 --> 03:18:53,470
but all writers are on adderall.
Not all of them,

4847
03:18:53,500 --> 03:18:54,430
but a shit load of them.

4848
03:18:54,810 --> 03:18:55,643
Right.
Mike Lawrence that were in the Cabo 

4849
03:18:57,240 --> 03:18:58,110
Festival.
And um,

4850
03:18:58,200 --> 03:18:59,890
and uh,
we're smoking pot,

4851
03:18:59,891 --> 03:19:01,550
shitty pot,
Mexican pot.

4852
03:19:01,610 --> 03:19:02,630
And I was like,
[inaudible] no,

4853
03:19:02,631 --> 03:19:03,431
I don't smoke pot.
It was like,

4854
03:19:03,431 --> 03:19:04,730
why don't you Mike?
And he goes,

4855
03:19:04,940 --> 03:19:07,540
I'm trying to get writing jobs.
I don't want to get tested.

4856
03:19:07,560 --> 03:19:08,420
I'm like,
oh dude,

4857
03:19:08,750 --> 03:19:12,590
Hollywood doesn't test for drugs.
Are you kidding me?

4858
03:19:13,800 --> 03:19:15,000
I'm trying to get started.
Right.

4859
03:19:15,230 --> 03:19:16,280
It was just starting.
I was like,

4860
03:19:16,310 --> 03:19:20,120
they're all long coke weed.
They don't test for that Bro.

4861
03:19:20,270 --> 03:19:23,330
That's hilarious.
Testing writing chops.

4862
03:19:23,990 --> 03:19:27,010
He imagined how shitty the movies you'd 
become called.

4863
03:19:27,020 --> 03:19:29,560
So horrible.
You're testing somebody for a weed.

4864
03:19:29,870 --> 03:19:31,010
It,
it'll be awful.

4865
03:19:32,490 --> 03:19:33,323
It's three 30 ladies and gentlemen,
we've got to bring this bad boy to a 

4866
03:19:34,981 --> 03:19:36,960
close.
We want to thank you all for tuning in.

4867
03:19:37,080 --> 03:19:38,880
Well let me say this already,
the great.com

4868
03:19:39,060 --> 03:19:41,070
go to [inaudible] dot com but I'm doing 
this hour,

4869
03:19:41,240 --> 03:19:42,270
uh,
it Edinburgh.

4870
03:19:42,270 --> 03:19:43,103
That's Kinda what I geared at for,
for last year and a half to fucking 

4871
03:19:45,661 --> 03:19:49,590
unveiling and Edinburgh.
So I've watched them for two times now.

4872
03:19:49,591 --> 03:19:51,740
I was out there and it's kind of got 
influenced by someone that,

4873
03:19:51,741 --> 03:19:54,000
her style of comedy,
I think the only problem with this style

4874
03:19:54,030 --> 03:19:54,863
comedies,
they give up and we've talked about 

4875
03:19:56,031 --> 03:19:57,390
this.
They give up the jokes for the sake of a

4876
03:19:57,391 --> 03:20:00,660
point or theme.
So I'm very careful not to do that,

4877
03:20:00,661 --> 03:20:03,390
to make all this,
it work on its own and clubs in America.

4878
03:20:03,450 --> 03:20:08,450
I like how you confidently pronounced 
the name and Brah Brah Edinburgh is what

4879
03:20:09,721 --> 03:20:13,260
a lot of Americans go borrow Gogol and 
run broke.

4880
03:20:13,530 --> 03:20:16,390
So I'll be there August 2nd through the 
26th at [inaudible].

4881
03:20:16,470 --> 03:20:17,303
Tell all your friends from the UK that 
are going to show to check out Ari 

4882
03:20:21,180 --> 03:20:22,830
Shaffir Ju 6:00

4883
03:20:23,440 --> 03:20:26,560

4885
03:20:28,490 --> 03:20:30,230

That's like Christmas bitch.

4886
03:20:30,670 --> 03:20:31,750
Come out.
Enjoy it.

4887
03:20:31,810 --> 03:20:32,643
Asleep asleep are the great dot.
But I would like to point out that I 

4888
03:20:36,491 --> 03:20:39,490
offered Ari a free fanny pack.
He would not take it.

4889
03:20:39,880 --> 03:20:40,780
I said,
he will not tell you.

4890
03:20:40,790 --> 03:20:43,000
I said absolutely not actually.
Really like so proud.

4891
03:20:43,001 --> 03:20:44,120
You're like,
eh.

4892
03:20:45,200 --> 03:20:46,720
It's,
it helps when you're traveling.

4893
03:20:46,721 --> 03:20:48,730
You put your keys and your wallet in 
there and you don't have to hold him.

4894
03:20:48,731 --> 03:20:49,630
He's like,
fuck you.

4895
03:20:50,420 --> 03:20:53,650
I have a reputation to maintain.
I'm free on a lot of stuff,

4896
03:20:53,680 --> 03:20:54,690
right.
Fanny pack free.

4900
03:21:01,060 --> 03:21:03,670
Hamilton Morris from vice.
Would you want to Redo?

4901
03:21:03,910 --> 03:21:04,780
We did one many,
many,

4902
03:21:04,781 --> 03:21:07,240
many years ago and we got so high we 
couldn't talk.

4903
03:21:07,530 --> 03:21:09,250
I'm like,
I'm here with the drug guy from vice.

4904
03:21:09,251 --> 03:21:11,350
We're going deep.
We went so deep.

4905
03:21:11,351 --> 03:21:12,184
We went so deep.
I didn't even know if I was there or 

4906
03:21:13,091 --> 03:21:14,470
not.
I wasn't even sure what I was hearing my

4907
03:21:14,471 --> 03:21:15,490
voice,
if it was mine,

4908
03:21:16,040 --> 03:21:17,520
we barely talked.
It was,

4909
03:21:17,521 --> 03:21:19,210
I was close to death,
but he's coming back.

4910
03:21:19,211 --> 03:21:21,220
He's going to be here tomorrow.
