1
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:08,710
The job,
real good experience.

2
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:15,440
Well all day we don't know what 
everyone's panicky wet.

3
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,260
What do I do?
I'm suddenly faced with adversity and my

4
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,620
botox is running out so my head is 
actually able to squint.

5
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:34,970
Just order an uber.
Before the rain hits you,

6
00:00:34,971 --> 00:00:39,971
you'll be okay.
Then you just watched somebody else 

7
00:00:39,971 --> 00:00:39,971
freak out and you think about it like he
starts thinking that.

8
00:00:39,971 --> 00:00:41,750
How much has this guy been screened?
You know,

9
00:00:41,751 --> 00:00:46,751
was it,
was I supposed to be getting picked up 

10
00:00:46,751 --> 00:00:47,640
by a lyft driver and the uber driver 
intercepted the signal or did.

11
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:52,670
Did Uber know about all that shit?
We're uber employees were calling 

12
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:57,010
apparently.
There's like one guy was doing it like 

13
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:59,380
one guy was like pushing it.
They were calling like Uber Rides or 

14
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:04,330
Uber was calling lyft rides and then 
like just canceling the Gig really 

15
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:07,820
fucking up.
Their bitch is fucking up their business

16
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:12,680
prank calls,
like fake fake orders for cars and shit.

17
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:14,150
Like.
Which is really.

18
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:18,110
I mean I know it's not.
The whole company does not want to use a

19
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:19,160
company when you hear shit like

20
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,330
maybe that's what it takes this.
Somebody took the Glen Gary,

21
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:21,900
Glen Ross

22
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:25,530
first scene to heart.
Just doing that at every level of Uber.

23
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:26,940
Yeah.
You want coffee,

24
00:01:26,941 --> 00:01:30,990
you got to be a fucking closer coffee's 
for closers.

25
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,460
I,
I just wish,

26
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:37,540
you know,
I mean it seems like Uber was doing so 

27
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,831
well like it.
I just wished there would be a company 

28
00:01:39,831 --> 00:01:39,870
like that that would turn out to be 
super cool.

29
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,730
You know?
I always wished that about every company

30
00:01:41,731 --> 00:01:42,920
that I like,
you know,

31
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:47,930
like Oh,
wouldn't it be nice if they're super 

32
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:47,930
cool?

33
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:47,930
Yeah.
Like secretly all of Walmart's money was

34
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:48,710
going to some kind of charity instead of
just.

35
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:53,720
Walmart is always going to be a problem 
and I don't mean that in a good way or a

36
00:01:53,721 --> 00:01:58,721
bad way.
It means just like whenever you have a 

37
00:01:58,721 --> 00:01:58,721
big giant thing,
you have a problem on both sides.

38
00:01:58,721 --> 00:02:00,500
You know,
like one problem is people go,

39
00:02:00,501 --> 00:02:01,250
well,
you know,

40
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,810
Walmart comes into town and it kills all
the small businesses and are we really?

41
00:02:05,811 --> 00:02:10,811
That grows that like saving a dollar 
here and five cents there is worth us 

42
00:02:11,121 --> 00:02:16,121
going to some giant box where some 
people are in it that we don't know or 

43
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:21,910
are we going to go to our local place 
where we have like a relationship with 

44
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:21,920
the people that own it.
It's like this small connection,

45
00:02:21,921 --> 00:02:25,100
like you're directly connected to these 
people's lives.

46
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,280
I think the issue at least where I fuck 
up as a consumer is you drive by and 

47
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,931
let's say you need a new tire for your 
car and you know you don't really care 

48
00:02:34,931 --> 00:02:36,260
about your car that much.
It's like a Corolla or whatever that has

49
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:41,290
the cheapest tires in town.
So like ideologically I don't really 

50
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:45,041
care who my tire replacement person is 
or their wellbeing or their quality of 

51
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:45,590
life.
I just want the cheapest tire.

52
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,720
See I don't.
I get that.

53
00:02:47,721 --> 00:02:50,780
And then like it spills over into other 
areas of your life where you're like,

54
00:02:50,781 --> 00:02:55,781
well I want healthy groceries,
but what if Walmart can give me the 

55
00:02:55,781 --> 00:02:56,180
cheapest fucking lettuce?
Then maybe I just don't care.

56
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:01,750
I send a lot of people.
I think eventually just buy everything 

57
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:01,750
that way.

58
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:01,750
Right?
Yeah.

59
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:05,520
Well it can definitely go that way.
I mean if you're a smart consumer,

60
00:03:05,521 --> 00:03:08,280
if that's all you're worried about and 
you're just worried about numbers,

61
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:12,450
but I think that there's companies that 
you just don't have a relationship with.

62
00:03:12,451 --> 00:03:13,920
You don't feel bad about that.
Like,

63
00:03:13,921 --> 00:03:18,921
well,
I don't have a relationship with whole 

64
00:03:18,921 --> 00:03:18,921
foods.
I don't know them.

65
00:03:18,921 --> 00:03:18,921
You know,
I go there.

66
00:03:18,921 --> 00:03:19,440
The folks are all nice that worked 
there,

67
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,860
but I know they're just working there.
You know the guys where you get the Kale

68
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,090
Salad from.
Super Cool.

69
00:03:24,091 --> 00:03:29,091
Say Hi to say hi to the butcher Chit 
Chat with the people at the cash 

70
00:03:29,091 --> 00:03:29,091
register.
Like,

71
00:03:29,091 --> 00:03:29,970
yeah,
everybody's friendly.

72
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,370
But I know that their employees,
you know what I'm saying?

73
00:03:32,371 --> 00:03:34,500
Like I don't feel connected to giving 
them my money,

74
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:38,970
but like this restaurant that I go to 
all the time and the folks that own it,

75
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,450
they've owned it for like 30 years and 
they're just the nicest,

76
00:03:42,451 --> 00:03:45,870
friendliest people.
They're just really cool to talk to.

77
00:03:45,871 --> 00:03:50,871
Like every time I talked to them,
like the guys from Greece and he's 

78
00:03:50,871 --> 00:03:52,350
always telling me about like the 
difference between the way people behave

79
00:03:52,351 --> 00:03:56,040
there and behave here and just I get 
into these cool conversations with him.

80
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:59,100
He's a very bright well read guy and 
just an interesting guy.

81
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,680
So I love going there and giving them my
money.

82
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:04,170
But if I go to like applebee's,
I don't fucking know anybody.

83
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,980
Yeah.
The 16 year old hostess,

84
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:08,370
she's not going to be there next week.
It'll be somebody else.

85
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:13,390
Yeah,
I mean I'll be friendly to them for 

86
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:13,390
sure.
You know,

87
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:13,390
it's nice if you get the same waitress 
again.

88
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:18,100
Oh Hey.
How you doing was no culture there 

89
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:18,100
though,
corporation.

90
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:18,450
Well that's,
that's what we,

91
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,220
we miss in like losing those little 
small businesses,

92
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:24,260
you know.
But the first small business owner,

93
00:04:24,261 --> 00:04:25,520
man,
it's a fucking grind.

94
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,580
It's hard to do.
I mean you have to,

95
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:30,410
you have to really be selling something 
somebody wants.

96
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:35,740
Like there's a,
there's a fucking starbucks down the 

97
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,190
street here and next to the starbucks 
there's a shoe dealer,

98
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:41,330
like a not a shoe dealer shoe repairman.
I'm like,

99
00:04:41,331 --> 00:04:43,640
dude,
like how many fucking people are getting

100
00:04:43,641 --> 00:04:44,900
their shoes repaired?
I mean,

101
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:49,970
is there some like death of a salesman 
type still out there need to get their 

102
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:50,450
shoes polished before an interview?
I mean,

103
00:04:50,451 --> 00:04:55,451
I guess it's a,
I guess if you have enough people in an 

104
00:04:55,451 --> 00:04:55,451
area that is going to be enough.

105
00:04:55,451 --> 00:04:57,740
People wear heels or falling off and I 
mean maybe I'm naive,

106
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,020
but every time I go by that place 
there's fucking nobody in it.

107
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,250
I'm like,
who the hell's kitchen?

108
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:03,920
Their shoes fixed.
I would dress up like Jay gatsby one day

109
00:05:03,921 --> 00:05:08,630
and just go in there and pull up in that
big yellow convertible that he had.

110
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,440
Then Leonardo Dicaprio had.
I was super torn on that movie.

111
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,590
I was torn on it in two ways.
One,

112
00:05:15,591 --> 00:05:20,150
it was like so surreal.
Everything was so crazy.

113
00:05:20,151 --> 00:05:22,820
Like the way it was filmed,
it was so obvious like you were watching

114
00:05:22,821 --> 00:05:24,020
a dream or something,
you know?

115
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:27,500
It was the special effects.
Like when they were at the party and the

116
00:05:27,501 --> 00:05:29,420
glitter was flying and everybody's 
dancing.

117
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,890
It's so over the top.
The way he was driving over the top.

118
00:05:32,891 --> 00:05:36,890
It was almost hard to accept it as like 
a real story,

119
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,680
like watching a story about real humans.

120
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,760
I think that goes back to the book 
itself.

121
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:46,790
Like I remember liking it a lot in high 
school and college and thinking like 

122
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,120
this is what life was like back in the 
day in New York.

123
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:50,310
And then you get older and you're like,
that's not life at all.

124
00:05:50,311 --> 00:05:52,530
That's just some frivolous bullshit that
somebody thought up.

125
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,480
It was like a,
you know,

126
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:58,100
romance,
a romance narrative

127
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:03,100
within the 19 twenties.
It has no application of modern life at 

128
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:03,920
all.
It's just a fucking fantasy.

129
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,260
What's a sad ending with phantom?
Well,

130
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:11,620
there is something,
I'm sure much more than there is now to 

131
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,260
someone who has a completely fabricated 
existence.

132
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,680
There's something we all think is 
amazing about that.

133
00:06:15,681 --> 00:06:20,681
Like someone who could just fabricate 
their life and like how long can they 

134
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:22,100
pull it off?
Like it's a great plot engine,

135
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,610
which he's good at.
Dicaprio is like the master of being the

136
00:06:25,611 --> 00:06:27,950
uh,
was that a movie he was in?

137
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:33,010
Where use the con artists kind of Wolf 
of Wall Street or the wolf of Wall 

138
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:33,380
Street.
And then I'm thinking of um,

139
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,400
catch me if you can.
Oh,

140
00:06:35,401 --> 00:06:36,440
you,
that's right.

141
00:06:36,441 --> 00:06:39,350
And then really remember that one.
He's a bad motherfucker.

142
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:43,310
I mean he doesn't get as much credit 
because he's beautiful and he's a,

143
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,300
you know what I'm saying?

144
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:47,930
He's beautiful and he's kind of a pussy.
That's always the case for us.

145
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,240
Yeah,
well him especially I'm in,

146
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,490
I think he's one of the greatest actors 
ever.

147
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:57,760
But like,
he's such a beautiful man and he's 

148
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:57,760
silly.
He's obviously so privileged.

149
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,620
People look at him like this fucking 
guy.

150
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,290
He's.
Yeah,

151
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:02,450
he's pretty good actor.
Listen,

152
00:07:02,451 --> 00:07:05,360
if that guy was ugly,
he would be saluted.

153
00:07:05,361 --> 00:07:10,361
He would be mean.
Forget what Steve Buschemi gets kind of 

154
00:07:10,361 --> 00:07:10,361
loves DBA.
Shimmy gets here.

155
00:07:10,361 --> 00:07:12,590
We'll get that times a thousand.
If he was ugly,

156
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:17,700
if he looked like Steve Buschemi,
God damn capital with the toast of the 

157
00:07:17,841 --> 00:07:19,700
town,
he needs a couple scars.

158
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:20,900
No,
he's too pretty.

159
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,500
Even if he gets a couple of scars,
people like good.

160
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:24,800
You know,
they,

161
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,480
like,
he's lived his life,

162
00:07:26,481 --> 00:07:28,010
a beautiful,
wealthy,

163
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,950
super talented actor.
That's too much for some people,

164
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,520
you know,
I know people who don't take them 

165
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:36,520
seriously.

166
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:36,520
Like I've had conversations with,
you know,

167
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,820
quote unquote actor folks who are really
brutal,

168
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,640
really brutal.
I was watched,

169
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,340
watched at the beginning of move of a 
movie,

170
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:45,840
a really good movie with this,
uh,

171
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:50,390
this friend of mine and uh,
this actor walks by and goes a man.

172
00:07:50,391 --> 00:07:53,720
His career really fell off after this 
movie talking about.

173
00:07:53,721 --> 00:07:55,370
It was Jurassic Park,
the,

174
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,620
the first one.
And uh,

175
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,670
there's the dude who,
uh,

176
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:05,480
he was in event horizon,
Sam Neill,

177
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,980
Sam Neill.
Exactly.

178
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:08,030
The dude's like,
hey,

179
00:08:08,031 --> 00:08:09,800
his career really fell off after this 
movie.

180
00:08:09,801 --> 00:08:14,801
Like,
shut the fuck up and just watch the 

181
00:08:14,801 --> 00:08:17,351
movie.
Jesus Christ does it have to be about 

182
00:08:17,351 --> 00:08:20,321
that.
But they even real actory actor times 

183
00:08:20,321 --> 00:08:21,550
just like praise performances,
you know,

184
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:22,880
you know,
oh my God.

185
00:08:22,881 --> 00:08:26,300
Jeff Goldbloom was amazing in that film.
He's quirky looking at enough.

186
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:29,990
He allow them to be amazing in a film.
But Leonardo Dicaprio,

187
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,440
Goddamn beautiful man.
Perfect bone structure.

188
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,300
Just as handsome as fuck.
Beautiful Hair,

189
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:40,330
the perfect Ville and Django.
Oh well that's why you get to see his 

190
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:41,120
range.
How good he really is.

191
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:43,910
Weight when he flips a switch and goes 
evil towards the end of the movie,

192
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,490
you know like Yo,
like you buy it.

193
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:51,820
Like he's not like there's certain dudes
who scream and yell and a movie and it 

194
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,240
almost ruins the movie because it makes 
me want to smack them.

195
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:55,710
Like if somebody was screaming and 
yelling at you that you know,

196
00:08:55,711 --> 00:08:58,200
you fake fuck this,
you're not even angry.

197
00:08:58,201 --> 00:09:00,240
Look at Shit is this,
I'm going to smack you.

198
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:03,420
But when he's screaming and yelling in 
that movie,

199
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:04,410
you're like,
oh,

200
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:07,020
we're at def con nine here.
We're about to get nuclear.

201
00:09:07,021 --> 00:09:08,730
Like Shit.
Someone's going to get shot.

202
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,690
Like this is like a death run.
Like there's this something horrible.

203
00:09:12,691 --> 00:09:14,790
Is gonna happen at the end of this 
conversation?

204
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:20,630
Like you got that from in the wolf,
the wolf of Wall Street to and it's 

205
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:20,630
gacked out of his mind.
Yeah.

206
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:22,800
There's like a.
like he really believed that he could go

207
00:09:22,801 --> 00:09:26,700
off the rails and fucking set off a 
suitcase nuke or something stupid.

208
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,260
You know,
he's gone

209
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,600
but too beautiful.
Too beautiful for Hollywood.

210
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:35,960
Sure.
Definitely Django.

211
00:09:35,961 --> 00:09:39,380
They made him look fucked up his teeth.
Yeah,

212
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,440
they did a good job.
That's what people looked like back 

213
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:44,440
then.
They didn't have fucking caps.

214
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:44,440
Yeah.
And they uh,

215
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,110
smoke from a pipe all day.
This,

216
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,730
I know a dude who got,
um,

217
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,760
he got,
I guess their veneers.

218
00:09:49,761 --> 00:09:52,430
He got teeth put on over his teeth.
Yeah.

219
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:55,040
They just.
Jamie's fucking yell at his teeth.

220
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:57,770
Yes ma'am.
Nobody had pretty teeth back then,

221
00:09:57,771 --> 00:10:00,110
man.
But he turned psycho towards the end.

222
00:10:00,111 --> 00:10:01,110
Right?
Let's see here.

223
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,830
Um,
was I saying,

224
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:04,880
oh,
I know this dude.

225
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You know,
they have those veneer things and they 

226
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,000
make it look like you're wearing a 
mouthpiece.

227
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,860
Look at,
make sure lipstick out more.

228
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:15,020
This guy is fucking lip.
Stick out more now it's like,

229
00:10:15,021 --> 00:10:18,170
he's like,
he's wearing a very thin mouthpiece.

230
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,910
What if he doesn't wear it?
It's just yellow teeth.

231
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,820
He can't not wear it.
Chip away your teeth.

232
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:26,450
They chip away the surface of your teeth
and they put this new surface.

233
00:10:26,451 --> 00:10:27,710
All of your permanent.
Okay.

234
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:30,050
Yeah,
and it's like a veneer.

235
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,790
It's like a like this would if you took 
a really thin slice of this wood and put

236
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:37,730
it over some plastic bullshit and 
pretended it was oak.

237
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:43,060
So that's what they're doing.
They have this perfect white ceramic 

238
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:47,681
thing.
I guess it's like a ceramic or some may 

239
00:10:47,681 --> 00:10:47,681
be.
It may be something like

240
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,970
some plastic veneer.
Yeah,

241
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,810
but what like what is it made out of 
though?

242
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:57,290
It's like billiard ball type shit.
Phenolic hookup.

243
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:58,640
How you talk.
You get it done.

244
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:03,830
Well this guy did this guys are too big.
I mean I don't know what's going on.

245
00:11:03,831 --> 00:11:06,170
I mean if he just decided to get bigger 
teeth or something like that.

246
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,010
But I'm looking at him talking and it's 
like he's wearing like a little bit of a

247
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:12,480
mouthpiece.
I've been honest.

248
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,560
This weird kick lately where I'm 
fascinated by people altering their 

249
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,970
image like radically.
I got onto with Renee Zellweger,

250
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,430
like I saw that renee,
Renee Zellweger thing.

251
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:25,670
That is like the textbook case of 
somebody.

252
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:29,090
Yeah.
Then is and Jennifer Gray?

253
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,230
No,
not chatter for Greg.

254
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:33,170
Is that her from dirty dancing?
What was her name?

255
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:34,960
Is that right?
Jennifer Gray.

256
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,950
She was really pretty,
but she had a big nose.

257
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,360
Then she got her nose fixed.

258
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:40,010
I now,
I'm not sure if it works.

259
00:11:40,011 --> 00:11:41,260
Is it Jennifer Gray?
Yeah,

260
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,410
she was really pretty,
but she,

261
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:47,411
you know,
she had a Jewish looking knows that 

262
00:11:47,411 --> 00:11:48,890
European hump thing going on,
which is just character,

263
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:50,270
you know,
for sure.

264
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,080
Whatever.
Right.

265
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:54,160
Plus it disappears if you're looking 
dead at anything.

266
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:57,670
Yeah.
Well she was cute and then she became,

267
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:58,890
I guess,
you know,

268
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:00,050
she likes it better,
but it's,

269
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,990
she's a different person,
that's for sure.

270
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:07,890
So anyway,
I got on this kick lately where I 

271
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:07,890
started looking at all these,
uh,

272
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:10,920
different procedures that people have 
done and uh,

273
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:16,830
I watched a nose job yesterday.
Somebody sent me a nose job on twitter 

274
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:17,220
of this,
uh,

275
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:19,960
this woman getting her nose fixed.
I tweeted it.

276
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:24,990
You can see it on my twitter page,
but it's a long video of the entire 

277
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:26,650
process.
It's sped up a bit,

278
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:30,070
but holy shit,
is it brutal?

279
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:31,720
Like the nose,
well,

280
00:12:31,721 --> 00:12:36,721
you know,
I had my nose cleaned out like I had my 

281
00:12:36,721 --> 00:12:39,391
nose,
a deviated septum repair to has smashed 

282
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:42,061
Septum and it was blocking off most of 
my ability to breathe out of my 

283
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:43,990
nostrils,
but this,

284
00:12:43,991 --> 00:12:48,991
this is,
this was way more involved because they 

285
00:12:48,991 --> 00:12:51,181
had to actually chip away her bone.
They peeled her nose back like a banana 

286
00:12:51,181 --> 00:12:56,010
and then chipped away the bone to make 
the nose smaller and then put it all 

287
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:59,611
together again.
Isn't it amazing the lengths people go 

288
00:12:59,611 --> 00:12:59,611
to to do something that nobody cares 
about any way?

289
00:12:59,611 --> 00:13:01,810
Well,
some people do care though.

290
00:13:01,811 --> 00:13:02,890
See,
that's the thing.

291
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,180
You know,
you can't say that.

292
00:13:04,181 --> 00:13:08,110
Some people don't look better once you 
fix their fucked up nose because.

293
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:09,190
Well,
Renee Zellweger,

294
00:13:09,191 --> 00:13:14,191
nobody would have cared if she had just 
aged and looked somewhat like she used 

295
00:13:14,191 --> 00:13:17,581
to look.
Not that you don't have the right to 

296
00:13:17,581 --> 00:13:19,330
change your appearance,
but it was just that that sudden shock.

297
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:21,010
That kind of surprised people.
Well,

298
00:13:21,011 --> 00:13:22,000
imagine this.
Okay,

299
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:27,450
you,
you're a young man and you make your 

300
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:28,060
living off of your mind.
Okay?

301
00:13:28,061 --> 00:13:30,100
You make your living off of your 
commentary,

302
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:32,680
your ability to notice things,
podcasting,

303
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,270
things along those lines.
I'm much older than you.

304
00:13:37,271 --> 00:13:42,271
I'm 47 years old,
but my brain doesn't work any 

305
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:44,590
differently than when I was young.
My body is slowly but surely starting to

306
00:13:44,591 --> 00:13:47,860
work less good.
Like I get injured more easily.

307
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:52,950
Like I still work out pretty hard,
but when I get injured like I fucked my 

308
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:54,700
elbow up a couple months ago in this 
bitch just won't get better.

309
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:56,350
You know what I mean?
So those kinds of things.

310
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:00,460
But I'm not a professional athlete.
If I was,

311
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,770
I would be freaking out.
If I was,

312
00:14:02,771 --> 00:14:06,100
I'd be freaking out if I was a 
professional talker,

313
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:11,280
if my brain started to slowly slow down 
and my brain started not able to form 

314
00:14:11,771 --> 00:14:16,771
sentences or not being able to recognize
and objective behavior problems or you 

315
00:14:17,781 --> 00:14:22,781
know,
confusion of what the topic is I'm 

316
00:14:22,781 --> 00:14:22,781
discussing.

317
00:14:22,781 --> 00:14:24,700
If those types of things started 
happening on a regular basis and someone

318
00:14:24,701 --> 00:14:25,600
came along and said,
hey,

319
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:27,680
we can give you this drug.
You know,

320
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:30,220
it's gonna make you 70 percent better.
Yeah.

321
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,340
It's like,
you know,

322
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,360
you're getting old,
we're going to shoot your forehead up 

323
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,860
with botulism and it's going to freeze 
the whole thing so you can't,

324
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,320
you can't look frown and then it'll 
relax.

325
00:14:41,321 --> 00:14:42,550
It will make you look a little better.
You're like,

326
00:14:42,551 --> 00:14:43,040
okay,
okay.

327
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:45,010
And then everybody's like,
what's wrong with your fucking.

328
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:48,640
But to her,
she's like my forehead's lynee anymore.

329
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:53,700
Yeah.
The acting career has been extended 

330
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,780
maybe,
but maybe people are just going to get 

331
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:55,780
weirded out by you,
you know?

332
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:59,810
Did you see that Dutchess who's worth 
like some an godly amount of money,

333
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:04,700
but she's had like insane amounts of 
plastic surgery and she's just taken ill

334
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:06,500
just pull.

335
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:11,500
If you buy better view,
pull up Dutchess plastic surgery 

336
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,020
disaster you see here.
But this poor lady,

337
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:17,290
when she was young,
she was very pretty and obviously that 

338
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:18,320
meant a lot to her.
If there was a big part of who she was,

339
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:23,350
not just a part of who she was,
but like most of her world probably for 

340
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,890
a lot of beautiful women.
It's like you're,

341
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:28,430
you're born with the greatest lottery 
ticket ever.

342
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:31,640
Like everywhere you go,
people are just tripping over themselves

343
00:15:31,641 --> 00:15:33,620
to get to you,
to be nice to you,

344
00:15:33,621 --> 00:15:35,300
to get close to you,
to give you things,

345
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:39,110
and it's really just because of the 
dimensions of your face and your body.

346
00:15:39,111 --> 00:15:43,590
It's incredible and you have to be quite
a piece of shit to fuck that up.

347
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:47,960
Like to like to get it so that men don't
want to talk to you.

348
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:52,220
Even though you're perfectly designed,
you have to be like really annoying,

349
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:57,500
you know,
you have to be like really mean are 

350
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,040
really selfish or were guys like,
I don't care how hot she is out of here,

351
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:58,990
you know,
most,

352
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,370
there's almost always going to be a 
suitor.

353
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:05,300
That's a good picture of her by the way.
And I'm not kidding.

354
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:09,830
There's a before and after of her.
That's really quite brutal.

355
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,530
Yeah.
That's what she used to look like.

356
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:14,570
But that's like as she was getting 
older,

357
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:17,960
that was before she really hit it hard.
I'll just go ahead and find it.

358
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:21,860
But um,
where was,

359
00:16:21,861 --> 00:16:25,850
I was on a part of the money but she's 
unhappy.

360
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:30,290
So we were talking about good looks 
about how like how valuable that is.

361
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:35,350
It's a massive thing.
So imagine if you're a woman and your 

362
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:39,170
entire self worth is derived off your 
looks,

363
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,030
which is possible.
It sounds sad.

364
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:41,840
People are like,
well,

365
00:16:41,841 --> 00:16:44,570
what do we put it?
Sexist fucking things that say men.

366
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:46,820
Women don't think like that.
But listen,

367
00:16:46,821 --> 00:16:48,740
let's be realistic.
Men think like that.

368
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:50,870
There's some men that think like that.
There she is.

369
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,730
There's some men that think like that 
and there's some good.

370
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,880
Yeah,
there's some people that are fucking 

371
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,061
beautiful and those people,
they do have that Willy Wonka golden 

372
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:04,421
ticket and a lot of times it's just 
being born that way just to roll the 

373
00:17:04,421 --> 00:17:07,901
dice.
So if you got that lottery ticket and 

374
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:07,901
you're watching it slip away for some 
people,

375
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:08,750
that's a very,
very,

376
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:12,830
very tough pill to swallow.
They gotta read some Alan Watts slipping

377
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:16,250
away for everybody and we're all kind of
a continuous thing.

378
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,480
Yeah.
But then they see these young girls is 

379
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:21,480
20 year old girl laughing and giggling 
like cube bitch,

380
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,820
just angry,
you know?

381
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Do you think there's more envy between 
women and there is between men because 

382
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,510
guys don't have a lot of.
We don't have like generational envy 

383
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:32,400
adult really.
Um,

384
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,940
I don't know,
but this is what I definitely think.

385
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:39,530
I definitely think there's zero value in
wondering who's got it worse.

386
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:41,930
Men Or women,
you know?

387
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:46,140
Who Do you think it's worse for a man to
feel jealous or a woman to feel Joe's?

388
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:48,260
Um,
I think it's definitely not worrying.

389
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:49,740
Worth worrying about.
Got It.

390
00:17:49,741 --> 00:17:52,020
Worse in that situation.
Like the men.

391
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:57,080
I think the men woman thing is way safer
to be a guy in some respects.

392
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,280
You know,
you don't have to worry about women,

393
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:03,090
but you still have to worry about men.
But other than that,

394
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:05,670
there's benefits to both sides.
Clearly,

395
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:06,530
you know,
it's,

396
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,820
it's really entirely who you are and how
you look at it.

397
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:13,821
There's women who you talked to them.
The last thing they would ever want to 

398
00:18:13,821 --> 00:18:14,880
do is be a fucking man.
Like,

399
00:18:14,881 --> 00:18:17,640
are you kidding?
You guys are morons.

400
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:22,880
I'm going to be one of these apes just 
running around trying to stick my tube 

401
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,630
steak into people.
And shoot Goo all the time and I'm lying

402
00:18:24,631 --> 00:18:29,631
to them constantly to try to get to that
position pulleys and blind and myself 

403
00:18:29,631 --> 00:18:31,590
about who I am to appeal more sexually 
attractive.

404
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:36,450
You see New Jersey is considering a bill
that would make it or it would make it.

405
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,840
It would make it sexual assault.
Yeah.

406
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,610
Form of sexual assault to lie about how 
much money you make,

407
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:47,450
which is really interesting,
but not just lie about money lie about 

408
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:47,450
anything.
Oh,

409
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:47,450
okay.
Yeah.

410
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:49,830
The idea is that using deception in 
order to get sex,

411
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:53,310
that you're a liar and you've,
you frauded someone.

412
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:55,800
But man.
Okay.

413
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,190
So then if that's the case,
then we're,

414
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,470
we're putting,
we're making sex like a value.

415
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:03,210
Well we're,
we're making sex.

416
00:19:03,211 --> 00:19:08,211
Like by saying that you're,
you're essentially condoning a form of 

417
00:19:08,281 --> 00:19:13,281
prostitution because if that's the case 
then is it a felony or whatever the fuck

418
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,130
type of charge they're calling it.
What kind of charge are they calling it?

419
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,470
What fence?
Whatever level of fences.

420
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:24,150
Why is it not a felony or a crime of a 
similar order?

421
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:29,300
If I decide to lie to you to become your
friend and make you give me a massage.

422
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:32,030
No.
Right,

423
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:37,070
no.
Then it's not because then you know you 

424
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,160
weren't sexually assaulted.
It's like the idea of sex and the idea.

425
00:19:38,161 --> 00:19:41,130
This person was absolutely willing to 
have sex with that person,

426
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,480
but only because that person didn't 
exactly tell the truth.

427
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,400
Well,
if you're,

428
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:50,740
if you get like friends with someone and
have them stay over your house and here,

429
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:55,760
here man,
borrow my car because you think the guy 

430
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,711
has a lot of money.
It turns out he's totally fucking broke 

431
00:19:57,711 --> 00:19:58,230
and a con artists.
Is that a felony?

432
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:03,320
I bet it's not.
I bet if he goes to court and your 

433
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:03,320
honor,
the guy let me borrow his car.

434
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,250
Did you?
Mr Siemen let him borrow your car.

435
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:09,030
I thought he was the Duke of fucking 
Duchess of whatever.

436
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:09,680
You know?
Yeah.

437
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:11,130
Let him borrow my car.
Well,

438
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,760
you should have checked on that case to 
semest.

439
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,750
Yeah,
but if you get fucked,

440
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,470
if you let that guy fuck your face,
then people are going to go,

441
00:20:19,471 --> 00:20:23,400
hey,
you got rapes on you guys.

442
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,440
You got the bad end of the stick for 
sure.

443
00:20:25,441 --> 00:20:28,200
The shorter end of the stick a maybe 
not.

444
00:20:28,201 --> 00:20:31,350
I mean look,
people shouldn't lie,

445
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,330
but I don't know if you can make laws 
like that,

446
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,300
so it's such a slippery slope because if
a guy is dressed well,

447
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:40,560
a night club on a Saturday night and 
he's got a nice watch on,

448
00:20:40,561 --> 00:20:43,260
is he not misrepresenting himself?
Is that sexual assault?

449
00:20:43,261 --> 00:20:46,110
If he takes the girl back?
Yeah know I guess he's supposed to dress

450
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:51,111
in a fucking garbage man outfit because 
that's his income level or can you 

451
00:20:51,111 --> 00:20:54,961
actually look good on a weekend and I'm 
kind of like playing a little thought 

452
00:20:54,961 --> 00:20:55,250
experiment here,
but just because that's,

453
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,680
you know,
that's a very valid point.

454
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,390
It does seem like a slippery slope,
you know?

455
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,710
Yeah.
It's a very valid point.

456
00:20:59,711 --> 00:21:01,990
How about if someone with a fucking 
counterfeit watch on.

457
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:07,110
Yeah,
I mean that's a big thing with some 

458
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:09,511
guys.
They buy fake watches up and down Canal 

459
00:21:09,511 --> 00:21:11,410
Street rolodex rollback.
They're all over the place.

460
00:21:11,411 --> 00:21:13,180
Yeah.
And they're pretty good like some of the

461
00:21:13,181 --> 00:21:18,181
copies because now they have computers 
that can scan like it used to be when if

462
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:23,490
you bought like a fake rolex,
she had to hire someone to create the 

463
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,700
plans and have it.
I can just three d print that shit.

464
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:26,950
Probably like 99 point nine percent the 
same thing.

465
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,750
It's really similar.
I mean they can.

466
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:33,640
The good ones actually take a rolex and 
they literally copy every piece of it.

467
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:38,300
I don't know.
Power efficient.

468
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:39,090
It is.
I don't.

469
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:44,110
I mean half of them probably break.
I mean who the fuck knows what kind of 

470
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:44,110
quality control they have.

471
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:46,150
But if you're looking at it,
if you don't know any better,

472
00:21:46,151 --> 00:21:47,110
you like,
that's a rolex.

473
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,270
This guy's got money.
That's like a $5,000

474
00:21:49,271 --> 00:21:51,370
watch.
Meanwhile no lives with.

475
00:21:51,371 --> 00:21:55,510
His mom bought the watch for 50 bucks.
I bought it on craigslist with bitcoin.

476
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:59,290
Is that guy,
is he a fraud as he should he go to jail

477
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:00,730
for that?
How's that work?

478
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:04,660
He's only a fraud to himself.
I think that one of the big things about

479
00:22:04,661 --> 00:22:06,580
an expensive waste of money.
Watch this,

480
00:22:06,581 --> 00:22:08,230
you can look down and be like,
I earned this.

481
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:13,500
So if you're looking down at something 
that like reasserts that you're full of 

482
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,000
Shit,
then what do you like?

483
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,550
What kind of energy are you putting out 
there?

484
00:22:15,551 --> 00:22:20,551
You know?
Well that's the thing that I'd rather 

485
00:22:20,551 --> 00:22:23,760
pay $100 for a watch.
It's actually like a real fossil or 

486
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:23,760
real,
you know,

487
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,310
real time Max.

488
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:27,010
Then a fake rolex,
but a fake rolex.

489
00:22:27,011 --> 00:22:29,830
It looks exactly like a rolex and worked
perfectly.

490
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,190
The sound like a fake Ferrari,
you know,

491
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,050
you get a fake Ferrari on the highway,
like this fucking thing's terrible.

492
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:36,730
No,
it's a watch.

493
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,960
I mean,
it doesn't do a lot.

494
00:22:37,961 --> 00:22:40,300
Just tells you what fucking time it is.
Not only that,

495
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,480
the reality is those mechanical watches,
they're beautiful and everything like 

496
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:45,880
that.
It's kind of cool.

497
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I like the idea behind it that like a 
craftsman takes this watch and 

498
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,580
constructs it and all the wheels and 
gears and everything are all sinked up.

499
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:59,581
I think that's absolutely fascinating,
but one of those fucking quartz watches 

500
00:22:59,981 --> 00:23:02,680
works way better.
Those courts power watches,

501
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:07,681
those fucking things are never wrong.
There they stay like their time stays 

502
00:23:07,681 --> 00:23:11,050
perfect forever.
I have expensive rolex that the UFC gave

503
00:23:11,051 --> 00:23:16,051
me a watch that I would buy,
but it's a beautiful watch and that 

504
00:23:16,051 --> 00:23:18,400
fucker's wrong.
Like every two months I got to like back

505
00:23:18,401 --> 00:23:20,980
it up five minutes and I'm not 
exaggerating.

506
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:23,810
It's like every two months it's five 
minutes fast.

507
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,340
It's like,
you know,

508
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:27,220
thousands of dollars for this fucking 
thing.

509
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,140
If you.
It's old technology.

510
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:31,130
It's actually a.
it's kind of a fetish for,

511
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:32,590
for rich men.
Yeah.

512
00:23:32,591 --> 00:23:37,591
See,
this is like this watch doesn't cost 

513
00:23:37,591 --> 00:23:37,591
much and it glows in the dark and you 
can go under water with it.

514
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:37,980
Yeah.

515
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,560
It's never wrong.
It doesn't.

516
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:43,750
It doesn't get tired and then when it 
does,

517
00:23:43,751 --> 00:23:46,040
it's like a fucking two year lifespan

518
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,770
on the battery.
You put a new battery in your good.

519
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:52,610
Well not 30 years with the Apple Watch 
coming out.

520
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:55,970
Anyone who doesn't have an apple watch 
is going to be by default,

521
00:23:55,971 --> 00:23:57,890
a hipster.
So you'll be like,

522
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,430
oh,
okay.

523
00:23:58,431 --> 00:24:00,740
You're old fashioned.
You have the vintage watch on.

524
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,660
I don't buy that.
I don't think so.

525
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,120
Nope.
Too problematic.

526
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:07,130
It's a bunch of problems with the watch.
First of all,

527
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:11,750
no one wants to fucking be completely 
connected to your shit all the time like

528
00:24:11,751 --> 00:24:16,751
that.
It's one thing about having a phone but 

529
00:24:16,751 --> 00:24:19,121
constantly staring at your watch,
like your Dick Tracy and getting text 

530
00:24:19,121 --> 00:24:19,520
messages on your watch.
That shit's stupid.

531
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,610
Especially because you're.
You have to have your phone as well.

532
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:25,040
Like you already have your phone.
Like what do you.

533
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:30,190
Why do you,
why you want to look at your watch and 

534
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:30,190
get the weather.

535
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:30,190
So on your fucking phone.
It's right there.

536
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:31,340
What do we do?
You need it to be on everything.

537
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:36,460
How about you put it across your Dick 
and like a big neon sign in your 

538
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:36,460
underwear.
So when you peek and get the weather,

539
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,810
this is stupid.
Like we're getting ridiculous.

540
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:40,900
Like how many more things do we need?
I didn't.

541
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:42,650
I didn't realize you needed to have the 
phone on you.

542
00:24:42,651 --> 00:24:44,630
If that's the case,
it makes it a little less cool.

543
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:49,780
Well,
I'm sure you can use it without the 

544
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,311
phone,
but it doesn't have cellular 

545
00:24:51,311 --> 00:24:52,901
functionality it might have for the 
cellular function because I mean maybe 

546
00:24:52,901 --> 00:24:55,550
it's just like an appendage for an 
iphone.

547
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,230
We don't really need that.
Well,

548
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,350
I mean it's essentially a small little 
computer on its own.

549
00:25:00,351 --> 00:25:03,080
It carries mp3s.
You can do a lot of things with it.

550
00:25:03,081 --> 00:25:04,700
It does work as a watch,
you know,

551
00:25:04,701 --> 00:25:07,630
I'm sure if you load the weather and all
that stuff up on it,

552
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:12,680
it probably stays on,
but I'm pretty sure it syncs up to your 

553
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:12,680
watch this last week.

554
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,880
This bracelet,
this is a concept,

555
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,910
but supposedly they show it working.
I'll show you the video.

556
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:17,960
This brace,
this.

557
00:25:17,961 --> 00:25:22,961
They're showing two things here,
but this bracelet as well I was talking 

558
00:25:22,961 --> 00:25:25,331
about.
This is a video playing out of a 

559
00:25:25,331 --> 00:25:26,900
bracelet on your wrist and at the 
working iphone or screen touchscreen.

560
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:28,880
Oh my God.
And do it underwater.

561
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,860
Wow.
Whoa.

562
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,110
See,
we're getting too crazy.

563
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,180
But it's also a concept to.
They're asking for money.

564
00:25:35,181 --> 00:25:37,730
They said they needed like a million 
dollars to get it working.

565
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:43,610
Somebody better check the tech on that.
Maybe you had to pumping dump.

566
00:25:43,611 --> 00:25:47,790
I'm not invested in money in anything 
that's not already there looking cool.

567
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:49,580
It's going to be just give us a million 
dollars.

568
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:50,720
Yeah.
I don't get that.

569
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:53,850
People I'm going to get involved in the 
ground floor and no,

570
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:56,390
don't do that.
That's the case with,

571
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,250
uh,
with bitcoin and all coins really,

572
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,930
like there are,
aside from Bitcoin,

573
00:25:59,931 --> 00:26:04,931
there are thousands of other coins and 
they suck people in because it's one of 

574
00:26:04,931 --> 00:26:06,820
those things where,
um,

575
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:08,920
uh,
your mind goes,

576
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:12,290
this could be the next bitcoin,
but statistically it's not going to be,

577
00:26:12,291 --> 00:26:13,100
but it could be.

578
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:17,720
And so you put money into it and most of
those things turned out to be bullshit.

579
00:26:17,721 --> 00:26:19,970
But there are a couple that are 
promising so.

580
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:25,300
Well,
it was funny talking to Andreas 

581
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,230
Antonopoulos yesterday who's a really 
fucking interesting dude.

582
00:26:27,231 --> 00:26:29,450
I'm glad we.
I'm glad we have him on our side,

583
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:34,970
the human race since,
because he would be really dangerous in 

584
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:36,500
the hands of the military,
industrial nsa type side of things.

585
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:37,160
Yeah.
Well,

586
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:40,190
I'm sure they have guys like him that 
level of intelligence,

587
00:26:40,191 --> 00:26:45,191
but when he was talking about Bitcoin,
one of the things that he was talking 

588
00:26:45,191 --> 00:26:45,191
about was how

589
00:26:45,191 --> 00:26:49,010
it's important to recognize that this is
not something that you're going to do 

590
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:51,020
and get rich off of like you.
If you're getting involved in this.

591
00:26:51,021 --> 00:26:56,021
You get involved in this because you 
believe in it and that's essentially 

592
00:26:56,021 --> 00:26:56,021
what's going on right now.
And he likes that.

593
00:26:56,021 --> 00:26:56,730
You know,
it's like the,

594
00:26:56,731 --> 00:27:01,731
you know,
the people that are investing all their 

595
00:27:01,731 --> 00:27:03,501
money,
it's very likely you're gonna lose your 

596
00:27:03,501 --> 00:27:03,501
money,
but on long run,

597
00:27:03,501 --> 00:27:05,180
on the other hand it's also likely or 
not likely,

598
00:27:05,181 --> 00:27:10,181
it's possible you can make an 
astronomical amount because I'm Peter 

599
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:16,330
diamandis talks about this.
There's a youtube lecture people can 

600
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:18,401
look up called exponential thinking and 
he's the guy who started the x prize 

601
00:27:18,401 --> 00:27:22,571
foundation and I realized that part of 
it is probably just he wants to give 

602
00:27:22,571 --> 00:27:25,831
really bad ass lectures,
but I think that what he's saying is 

603
00:27:25,831 --> 00:27:28,211
actually true.
And that's that once you get any 

604
00:27:28,211 --> 00:27:28,211
technology and make it completely 
digital,

605
00:27:28,211 --> 00:27:33,160
it has to follow Moore's law to some 
extent where you get that doubling of 

606
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:36,671
sophistication every year to 18 months 
and uh,

607
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:41,590
if you kind of ignore the price itself 
that's been happening with Bitcoin,

608
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,740
like the sophistication of it is roughly
doubling every year in terms of services

609
00:27:45,741 --> 00:27:48,200
offered on top of it and things you can 
do with it.

610
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,860
And if you follow that out to its 
logical extreme,

611
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:55,010
um,
it eventually has to be worth a lot more

612
00:27:55,011 --> 00:27:57,110
than it's worth now because nobody's 
really using it.

613
00:27:57,111 --> 00:28:02,111
You know,
it's like a couple million people using 

614
00:28:02,111 --> 00:28:02,111
it that's less than one percent,
well,

615
00:28:02,111 --> 00:28:03,590
less than one percent of financial 
transactions.

616
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:05,990
If you get up to maybe like five or 10 
percent,

617
00:28:05,991 --> 00:28:09,260
which is totally reasonable,
I think that number has to be much,

618
00:28:09,261 --> 00:28:09,950
much larger.

619
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:15,790
Yeah.
For 10 percent sign out of the realm of 

620
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:17,461
possibility,
especially when you consider they're 

621
00:28:17,461 --> 00:28:17,461
starting to use it on paypal.
I mean,

622
00:28:17,461 --> 00:28:18,640
as soon as you can use it on paypal,
people are like,

623
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:19,840
Ooh,
that's pretty easy.

624
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,930
If I could just go with bitcoin instead 
of dollars and you could start,

625
00:28:22,931 --> 00:28:25,330
you know,
he set up a bitcoin account connected to

626
00:28:25,331 --> 00:28:26,890
your paper towels are buying things.

627
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:32,120
Well,
the thing was some of the remaining 

628
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:32,370
critics and the media of Bitcoin were 
saying,

629
00:28:32,371 --> 00:28:33,600
you know,
it's great technology,

630
00:28:33,601 --> 00:28:36,540
but it's not there yet because it's not 
ready for the masses.

631
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:41,630
And increasingly that's no longer a 
valid argument because there are a few 

632
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:43,620
companies that have built stuff on top 
of Bitcoin,

633
00:28:43,621 --> 00:28:45,900
which is kind of what people had been 
saying would happen.

634
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:51,020
Right?
And these services are so mainstream 

635
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:51,020
friendly that you take one look at it 
and you're like,

636
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:51,480
oh,
I get it.

637
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,970
Like the change tip thing.
Uh,

638
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,460
I had been doing stuff with them,
like playing with their tipping thing.

639
00:28:57,461 --> 00:28:58,440
You,
you've been getting a lot.

640
00:28:58,441 --> 00:28:59,460
I don't know if you've been ignoring 
them,

641
00:28:59,461 --> 00:29:04,461
but it's actually real money.
People are sending you and somebody 

642
00:29:04,461 --> 00:29:04,461
said,
hey,

643
00:29:04,461 --> 00:29:04,461
great podcast.
Here's a coffee.

644
00:29:04,461 --> 00:29:07,050
How do you know where it is?
It goes on your twitter.

645
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:07,580
Uh,
they,

646
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:12,860
they're very smart about it.
It integrates with your twitter account 

647
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:15,501
or your reddit account or google plus 
and it's like a just masses friendly I 

648
00:29:16,381 --> 00:29:17,550
can say to you like,
Hey,

649
00:29:17,551 --> 00:29:22,551
enjoy the video yesterday,
here's a beer and it sends you like $3 

650
00:29:22,551 --> 00:29:24,150
worth of Bitcoin does all the shit on 
the back end.

651
00:29:24,151 --> 00:29:29,151
So all you need to know is what your 
twitter password is and you can collect 

652
00:29:29,151 --> 00:29:29,151
your money.
Yeah,

653
00:29:29,151 --> 00:29:31,290
but what if you don't have an account?
As long as you have a twitter account,

654
00:29:31,291 --> 00:29:33,750
they'll like allow you to log in and 
collected.

655
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,400
Oh,
how bizarre.

656
00:29:35,401 --> 00:29:37,830
It's really well done.
It's a cool idea to a bunch of those.

657
00:29:37,831 --> 00:29:39,090
Well I didn't know what they were 
saying.

658
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,280
Just like ignored it.
Yeah.

659
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:42,040
No,
those are

660
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,610
for real.
They're not like phishing attempt.

661
00:29:43,611 --> 00:29:47,290
So those are strangers sending you money
because they like your podcast,

662
00:29:47,291 --> 00:29:49,550
which right now is still probably,
you know,

663
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:52,360
a very small percentage of listeners.
But what about when everybody has one of

664
00:29:52,361 --> 00:29:55,270
these things in their wallets and 
whenever they hear a podcast they like,

665
00:29:55,271 --> 00:30:00,271
they can just spontaneously send you 
fifty cents like that multiplied by a 

666
00:30:00,271 --> 00:30:02,020
thousand people or 200,000
people.

667
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:04,900
You can tell advertisers to get fucked 
within a couple of years.

668
00:30:04,901 --> 00:30:06,100
You know,
that's true.

669
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:09,910
But you run into the risk of running 
into people that.

670
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:12,460
One of the things that I like about the 
fact that the podcast is free.

671
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,880
So like when if people complain or if 
there's something they don't like or 

672
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,470
something they want different price was 
right.

673
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:22,300
Yeah.
Like let's do this is how I'm doing it.

674
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:23,440
No,
I don't want to hear it.

675
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:25,390
You should just try.
Why don't you make it an hour?

676
00:30:25,391 --> 00:30:26,680
Why don't you just stop,
listen,

677
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:28,000
stop,
stop.

678
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:30,400
I'm doing what I'm doing.
If you don't like it,

679
00:30:30,401 --> 00:30:31,840
that's cool.
But if they're paying for it,

680
00:30:31,841 --> 00:30:34,960
then they'll,
they'll be much more likely in that.

681
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:39,990
It's not most people,
but it's like selecting out the random 

682
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:40,930
problem people.
It's like most people,

683
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,750
you allow them to buy you a drink and 
everything's cool,

684
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,970
you know?
But there's that rare person,

685
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:51,240
you know,
I was in Vegas recently and this guy 

686
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:51,240
didn't even bias drink.
I was sitting with my friend Justin,

687
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:53,500
and it was after UFC we're just catching
up,

688
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,300
having a couple drinks,
shooting the shit.

689
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:59,200
There's this fucking guy and his wife 
and they were hammered next to us.

690
00:30:59,201 --> 00:31:01,960
They wouldn't leave us alone,
they just wouldn't,

691
00:31:01,961 --> 00:31:04,600
just wouldn't stop.
And the guy was just dumb.

692
00:31:04,601 --> 00:31:09,601
He kept interrupting with the questions 
and it was annoying everyone around 

693
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:09,601
them.

694
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:12,580
And then finally the dude chimes in and 
I go,

695
00:31:12,581 --> 00:31:13,330
come on,
man.

696
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:18,510
I go,
we're just trying to have a 

697
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:18,510
conversation.
I mean,

698
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:18,510
I,
I can't keep talking to you about this,

699
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:23,460
you know,
you keep interrupting in the middle of 

700
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:23,460
everybody talking.
He goes,

701
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,891
hey man,
I bought you a fucking drink that 

702
00:31:25,891 --> 00:31:28,421
somebody who needs an express hit of lsd
or something so they can see like just 

703
00:31:28,421 --> 00:31:29,350
the little tiny picture of what an 
asshole they're being.

704
00:31:29,351 --> 00:31:31,420
And then when he was just an idiot,
it was just really dumb.

705
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,500
But he won.
Meanwhile,

706
00:31:32,501 --> 00:31:34,630
he didn't buy me a drink.
He did.

707
00:31:34,631 --> 00:31:35,110
And I go,
no,

708
00:31:35,111 --> 00:31:35,920
you didn't.
I go,

709
00:31:35,921 --> 00:31:40,921
first of all,
I'm not drinking so you haven't bought 

710
00:31:40,921 --> 00:31:42,140
me a drink,
and my friend Justin paid the tab tab,

711
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:44,230
the thing he was lording over you.
He didn't even do,

712
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:49,770
but in his mind he was like,
he's probably bought drinks for people 

713
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:52,741
before,
so he decided this is where I was 

714
00:31:52,741 --> 00:31:52,741
fucking and I bought them at drank.

715
00:31:52,741 --> 00:31:57,180
I bought you a god to me.
He was just so drunk and dumb and just 

716
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:02,460
that those people are out there and so 
if those people are paying for your 

717
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,750
podcast,
you know,

718
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,950
if you're asking for donations,
you know,

719
00:32:05,951 --> 00:32:09,100
please donate to my pay pal button and 
then you get these twitters.

720
00:32:09,101 --> 00:32:14,101
I was going to donate to like hurt your 
ignorant rant on Ferguson.

721
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:18,790
Did sister line in the sand,
David Seaman,

722
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:24,210
Ferguson is where we separate the heroes
from the zeroes that people are going to

723
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:30,151
change this culture.
There's a lot of people like super 

724
00:32:30,151 --> 00:32:31,810
pumped up to start a revolution.
They're walking into fucking traitor.

725
00:32:31,811 --> 00:32:35,560
Joe's clapping their hands saying you 
can't stop the revolution.

726
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,500
Have you seen this?
This fucking videos of these morons?

727
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,100
And it's usually like

728
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:42,770
menopausal women,
um,

729
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:46,190
dudes with aimless,
shiftless minds,

730
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:48,020
you know,
people that there's something wrong with

731
00:32:48,021 --> 00:32:53,021
them.
They're out there walking through 

732
00:32:53,021 --> 00:32:53,021
supermarkets yelling at people.
People are just trying to,

733
00:32:53,021 --> 00:32:54,230
you can't stop the revolution.
It's like,

734
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:59,350
what revolution is this?
The revolution that interrupts shopping 

735
00:32:59,350 --> 00:32:59,350
with shitty singing,

736
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:01,250
the Revolution of affordable yogurt and 
fresh fruits,

737
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:01,970
vintages,

738
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:07,630
doing nothing but making a lot of energy
and sound by doing it.

739
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:13,110
Like,
I get that you're upset about police 

740
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:15,511
brutality.
I get that you're upset about the way 

741
00:33:15,511 --> 00:33:15,511
this country is going.
I get the.

742
00:33:15,511 --> 00:33:19,140
But going through trader Joe's,
clapping your hands is in fixing a 

743
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:22,741
fucking thing because just going to 
alienate people to whatever dumb idea 

744
00:33:22,741 --> 00:33:22,741
you have.

745
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,200
Yeah.
Uh,

746
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:29,450
there was a woman in Venice beach who 
came up to me recently and asked me to 

747
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:30,060
sign our petition to run for president.
She's going to run.

748
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:30,510
Yeah,
I know.

749
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:31,680
I was Kinda like,
well,

750
00:33:31,681 --> 00:33:34,560
don't you maybe you want to start with 
like a youtube channel or something.

751
00:33:34,561 --> 00:33:35,610
Like,
who the fuck are you?

752
00:33:35,611 --> 00:33:37,590
You know,
you can't just leap right to president.

753
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:41,010
And she had a few signatures and she was
so serious about it and I was like,

754
00:33:41,011 --> 00:33:41,970
well,
what's the platform?

755
00:33:41,971 --> 00:33:44,010
And she's like,
we're going to eliminate homelessness in

756
00:33:44,011 --> 00:33:45,870
Venice beach.
And I was thinking like,

757
00:33:45,871 --> 00:33:47,640
that's not really a national platform,
you know,

758
00:33:47,641 --> 00:33:48,740
you're going to become president and be 
like,

759
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:51,480
we have to address the five homeless 
people right here.

760
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,460
So,
um,

761
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:57,510
my point though is I think that people 
think that they have to change something

762
00:33:57,511 --> 00:34:02,511
and they have to do something because 
they can see all the problems around 

763
00:34:02,511 --> 00:34:02,640
them.
And for some people that's,

764
00:34:02,641 --> 00:34:06,000
let's go to a protest or let's,
let's run for office or let's,

765
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,500
you know,
let's just start a petition.

766
00:34:07,501 --> 00:34:11,970
No matter how ridiculous it sounds.
And the sad reality is,

767
00:34:11,971 --> 00:34:16,971
revolution is silent nowadays.
Like the people who are online buying 

768
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:21,171
bitcoin and developing these other coins
are creating more of a revolution than 

769
00:34:21,841 --> 00:34:23,580
anybody in the trader Joe's on a 
Tuesday.

770
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:29,420
Well,
I think what they're trying to do is 

771
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:29,420
raise awareness.
I guess what,

772
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:33,650
who the fuck isn't aware?
But this ferguson ruling went down to 

773
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:34,500
this riots and Missouri who's unaware 
that you don't,

774
00:34:34,501 --> 00:34:37,740
you don't have to walk through Pasadena 
yelling at people.

775
00:34:37,741 --> 00:34:39,150
Like those people were aware.

776
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:41,470
Well I was tweeting out stuff about,
um,

777
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:47,280
I was like,
why do black people distrust law 

778
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,220
enforcement so much?
It's not just this one case like some of

779
00:34:48,221 --> 00:34:53,221
the people on Fox News or making it seem
like this is happening in a vacuum and 

780
00:34:53,221 --> 00:34:57,031
it's that black people are really 
discriminated against when you look at 

781
00:34:57,031 --> 00:34:57,760
the percentages of,
of drug charges and stuff,

782
00:34:57,790 --> 00:35:02,020
even after decriminalization occurs in 
states like Massachusetts,

783
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:05,380
blacks continue to get arrested at 
disproportionately high rates.

784
00:35:05,381 --> 00:35:10,381
So you know,
there's some kind of racism happening 

785
00:35:10,381 --> 00:35:10,381
there.

786
00:35:10,381 --> 00:35:10,381
Well,
or you know,

787
00:35:10,381 --> 00:35:13,090
there's two things for sure.
There's racism definitely.

788
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:16,210
And definitely it makes it more 
difficult for cops.

789
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:21,720
You know,
if you are dealing with like say if 

790
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:25,351
you're a good cop and you know,
you're dealing with a community that's 

791
00:35:25,351 --> 00:35:28,981
been totally ostracized because there's 
been a bunch of cops that came before 

792
00:35:28,981 --> 00:35:32,611
you that profile a black people that 
pick them out to harass them,

793
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:36,480
forcing a couple of laws that just 
shouldn't exist anymore.

794
00:35:36,481 --> 00:35:41,130
Like it's weird me that here in the 
great God fearing state of California,

795
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:44,850
I can smoke weed and I consider it to be
an antidepressant for me.

796
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:46,530
And I do it legally.
You know,

797
00:35:46,531 --> 00:35:49,230
I'm a law abiding citizen.
I have the medical marijuana card.

798
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,830
You just go a couple hours away and 
suddenly you're like cool hand Luke,

799
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,900
uh,
to get the same exact thing.

800
00:35:54,901 --> 00:35:59,901
Like now you're on the wrong side of the
law and that's the case in half the 

801
00:35:59,901 --> 00:35:59,901
country.
Like we have this weird limbo thing.

802
00:35:59,901 --> 00:36:01,590
We're half the states,
have it half don't.

803
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,820
Oh,
you mean just the marijuana?

804
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:03,510
Yeah,
just the marijuana.

805
00:36:03,511 --> 00:36:08,511
And like as like a white journalists,
like I'm probably not going to be the 

806
00:36:08,511 --> 00:36:09,240
one who's singled out.
But if you're a dis,

807
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,480
uh,
um,

808
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:15,830
like any kind of disadvantaged minority,
your chances of being busted for 

809
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:17,700
something like that is way higher.
And then the cost,

810
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:20,100
just the cost to your,
um,

811
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:25,130
your career and everything,
it can take years to get that off your 

812
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:28,581
record.
So that's a real thing that is somewhat 

813
00:36:28,581 --> 00:36:29,340
a happening along racial lines.

814
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:32,920
Yeah.
I'm the fucking see about this.

815
00:36:32,921 --> 00:36:33,740
Uh,
uh,

816
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:35,410
that's a minor.
I mean,

817
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:38,980
that's a least like a physical thing 
that you can,

818
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:39,880
you could say like,
oh,

819
00:36:39,881 --> 00:36:41,440
it's a thing.
It's marijuana.

820
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:42,280
This is what,
you know,

821
00:36:42,281 --> 00:36:45,400
they're getting arrested for.
Did you hear about this fucking guy that

822
00:36:45,401 --> 00:36:50,401
uh,
the cops stopped the man for walking 

823
00:36:50,401 --> 00:36:50,401
with his hands in his pocket.
No,

824
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:55,630
it sounds like a guy in Michigan who was
doing nothing wrong and they both pull 

825
00:36:57,671 --> 00:37:00,700
out their cell phones and they film each
other.

826
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:05,850
So there's a two phones standoff between
the cop and the guy and it's the most 

827
00:37:07,331 --> 00:37:08,920
ridiculous shit ever.
I mean,

828
00:37:08,921 --> 00:37:10,840
this fucking guy just has his hands in 
his pocket.

829
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:15,990
That's it.
It's just a black guy who happens to 

830
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:18,121
have his hands in his pockets and the 
cop starts questioning him and the guy 

831
00:37:18,121 --> 00:37:18,460
pulls his phone out of the cop,
pulls his phone out.

832
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:20,080
They're both recording each other at the
same time.

833
00:37:20,081 --> 00:37:21,490
It's like,
what are we doing?

834
00:37:21,491 --> 00:37:23,140
That guy's not doing anything wrong.
Let him go.

835
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:25,990
Let him go.
He's not doing shit.

836
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:31,020
Okay?
He's walking with his hands in his 

837
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:31,020
pocket.
He pulled out his phone.

838
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:31,020
He's filming.
You're filming him.

839
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:33,220
You're wasting my fucking money and I'm 
going crazy seeing this,

840
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:37,090
so please let that fucking guy walk.
He's not committing any crimes,

841
00:37:37,091 --> 00:37:38,770
but walking was fucking hands in his 
pocket.

842
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:43,950
Everybody,
everywhere you look might be doing 

843
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:43,950
something that you can't see that's 
illegal.

844
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:46,290
It doesn't mean you get to knock on 
everybody's fucking door and going,

845
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,400
I didn't even see inside your house.
What are you doing in there?

846
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:53,550
You don't get to do that Douche bag and 
when a guy's walking down the street 

847
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:56,461
with his hands in his pockets,
he might as well be alone in his home 

848
00:37:56,461 --> 00:37:57,790
until you see something actually 
suspicious,

849
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:02,940
like he's reaching into his hand,
like he's pulling out a fucking gun out 

850
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:05,050
of his inside of his jacket.
If you don't see that,

851
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:09,280
then shut the fuck up because you just 
seen a guy walking and you're allowed to

852
00:38:09,281 --> 00:38:10,810
put your hands in your pocket to stay 
warm.

853
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,990
Don't have to like walk everywhere with 
our hands up.

854
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:15,700
Is that our new thing,
David Seaman?

855
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:20,820
We have to walk with her fingers moving.
So we know that there's no razor blades 

856
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:20,820
in between them.

857
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:22,000
We most certainly do not.
I think that,

858
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:27,010
um,
it's a real issue where I think that 

859
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:31,710
people,
a lot of people or status in the same 

860
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:31,710
way that,
um,

861
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:35,410
the few hundred years ago people were 
really a blindly adherent to the church,

862
00:38:35,681 --> 00:38:40,681
said anything.
Even if the church says something 

863
00:38:40,681 --> 00:38:40,681
completely ridiculous,
like the church said,

864
00:38:40,681 --> 00:38:44,281
Galileo is wrong.
So we have to keep them under house 

865
00:38:44,281 --> 00:38:44,680
arrest.
And today the state,

866
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:49,770
this similarly kind of opaque 
organization says Julian Assange is 

867
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:54,541
wrong.
We have to keep him under house arrest 

868
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:54,850
in his thing and that embassy,
it's Kinda the same thing,

869
00:38:54,851 --> 00:38:59,851
like you have somebody who's just the 
thought criminal saying things that you 

870
00:38:59,851 --> 00:39:00,190
don't like,
but there are actually some extent,

871
00:39:00,191 --> 00:39:05,191
completely fucking true,
at least in the case of Galileo in the 

872
00:39:05,191 --> 00:39:05,580
case of some of the surveillance stuff.
Uh,

873
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:06,720
so how,
how,

874
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:12,000
how different is it really?
And you have people ruining lives over 

875
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,421
marijuana possession in a state like 
Missouri that's a little behind the 

876
00:39:15,421 --> 00:39:16,030
times in that respect.
And you go,

877
00:39:16,031 --> 00:39:16,310
well,
what,

878
00:39:16,311 --> 00:39:21,311
what gives you this right to do that?
You're just like an agent of the church 

879
00:39:21,311 --> 00:39:22,150
ruining people's lives over accusations 
of witchcraft.

880
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:24,640
It's similarly nonscientific,
you know,

881
00:39:24,641 --> 00:39:26,740
there's no scientific basis for this 
stuff.

882
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:28,750
There's no public safety basis.

883
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:29,990
Well,
I think once,

884
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:34,670
once the time has gone and passed and 
there's been enough space to reflect,

885
00:39:34,671 --> 00:39:37,160
people are going to look back of 
marijuana legalization.

886
00:39:37,161 --> 00:39:42,161
Very similar to the way they looked at 
like putting people in jail for being a 

887
00:39:42,161 --> 00:39:42,161
witch.

888
00:39:42,161 --> 00:39:42,380
Oh,
for sure.

889
00:39:42,381 --> 00:39:45,590
I think every age,
every age has some kind of evil that for

890
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:50,591
whatever reason,
the people living through it just don't 

891
00:39:50,591 --> 00:39:52,631
really see how big a deal it is.
And that one before was segregation and 

892
00:39:52,631 --> 00:39:54,800
now I believe it to be,
um,

893
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:58,400
prohibition and not just of drugs,
economic prohibition.

894
00:39:58,401 --> 00:40:01,460
Like why are these little companies 
playing with Bitcoin,

895
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:06,820
concerned about the government going 
after them for money laundering and 

896
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:06,820
stuff.
It's ridiculous,

897
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:10,601
you know,
like they're trying to play with these 

898
00:40:10,601 --> 00:40:12,461
laws that were designed 40 years ago and
the technologies are totally different 

899
00:40:12,461 --> 00:40:12,820
now.
Well,

900
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:15,700
one of the things that prohibition does 
similar to censorship,

901
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:20,730
that's insidious.
One of the more insidious aspects of it 

902
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:22,390
is not just that they,
um,

903
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,070
you know,
you have a difference,

904
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:29,200
a differing opinion as to what should,
and should not be acceptable behavior,

905
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:32,080
whether it's saying certain words or 
using certain drugs.

906
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:37,590
But it becomes a thing where another 
person has control over you and it's 

907
00:40:38,591 --> 00:40:41,140
preventing you from doing something that
you want to do.

908
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:44,110
And when people prevent people from 
doing things they want to do,

909
00:40:44,111 --> 00:40:47,020
it builds up resentment and it causes 
conflict.

910
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:50,950
And it fucks up a lot of harmonious 
relationships.

911
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:56,640
It's very difficult to deal with the 
idea of one person having ultimate power

912
00:40:56,711 --> 00:41:01,711
over you,
especially for something like marijuana 

913
00:41:01,711 --> 00:41:01,711
or,
you know,

914
00:41:01,711 --> 00:41:03,040
saying certain words.
If you go to court,

915
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:04,720
okay,
you're in court and you know,

916
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:08,020
the guy passes some sort of a ruling on 
you and you're like,

917
00:41:08,021 --> 00:41:09,040
fuck you,
your honor.

918
00:41:09,041 --> 00:41:14,041
That's bullshit.
They can throw you in jail for longer 

919
00:41:14,041 --> 00:41:14,770
because you said,
fuck you,

920
00:41:14,771 --> 00:41:16,750
your honor.
Just some guy.

921
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:17,930
Contempt of court.
Yeah.

922
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:21,030
Some guy who by the way it's been proven
there.

923
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,180
Just people.
All right.

924
00:41:22,181 --> 00:41:25,750
It's not like this is like a hood that 
the judges.

925
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,770
Oh human,
no,

926
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:33,240
everyone's a fucking person.
So you've just got people there and you 

927
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,010
so can't say fuck

928
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:36,980
you to that guy if he does something 
unbelievably wrong.

929
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:42,130
And meanwhile has been proven in 
countless cases of judges being arrested

930
00:41:43,041 --> 00:41:45,680
for fraud.
Judges being arrested for corruption,

931
00:41:45,681 --> 00:41:48,860
masturbating in robes,
thing in Pennsylvania was pretty bad.

932
00:41:48,861 --> 00:41:52,340
He was sending all these kids to some 
kid corrections facility.

933
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:53,790
The worst.
He was getting paid.

934
00:41:53,791 --> 00:41:54,920
Yeah.
He was getting paid to do that.

935
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:57,890
And he's in jail now for like 35 years 
and that's not enough.

936
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:02,920
That's like a dickens novel that's awful
to treat kids like that and just taking 

937
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:06,911
kids away from their parents and having 
them locked up and he was profiting off 

938
00:42:06,911 --> 00:42:08,460
of it.
Deal where they would pay him that.

939
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,580
That's a judge,
that's the judge.

940
00:42:10,581 --> 00:42:15,581
It's a person that's this.
It all comes back to the drug war and 

941
00:42:15,581 --> 00:42:18,170
prohibition because uh,
a lot of stuff is just too complicated.

942
00:42:18,171 --> 00:42:21,410
You can't say that it's purely good or 
evil and it's gray areas.

943
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:24,680
But as far as I'm concerned,
the private prison industry,

944
00:42:24,681 --> 00:42:28,070
which is a real thing is as close to 
pure evil as you can get.

945
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:33,170
You have people who are using all the 
tools of capitalism which are 

946
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:34,130
significant tools and they're using it 
not to,

947
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:39,150
you know,
build us a better phone next year or to 

948
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:40,790
cure some new kinds of cancer.
They're using it to keep people in cages

949
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:45,791
for exploring their own minds and a 
trafficking and things that are just 

950
00:42:45,791 --> 00:42:46,250
natural herbs.
I mean,

951
00:42:46,251 --> 00:42:47,540
that's,
to me,

952
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:49,850
it's close to evil as you can get.
Well,

953
00:42:49,851 --> 00:42:51,290
it's a machine that

954
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:53,440
when have you,
when you got a big business like that,

955
00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:56,440
whether you're a big business is Walmart
or target,

956
00:42:56,770 --> 00:43:01,770
you know when,
when they get in trouble for trying to 

957
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:05,190
change regulations and laws in order to 
allow them to make more money in certain

958
00:43:05,201 --> 00:43:07,720
ways,
that might not be legal right now.

959
00:43:08,050 --> 00:43:09,220
People look at them like,
oh,

960
00:43:09,221 --> 00:43:10,270
they're terrible.
Oh,

961
00:43:10,271 --> 00:43:12,250
they're evil.
They're just trying to stay alive.

962
00:43:12,251 --> 00:43:14,950
There are machine and the machine that 
generates money.

963
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:18,660
When you get a million people involved 
in that machine and you,

964
00:43:18,661 --> 00:43:23,661
you,
you essentially have a million pieces 

965
00:43:23,661 --> 00:43:27,390
and these pieces run this organism,
this organism call it target or call it 

966
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:30,940
a name.
Any one of them.

967
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:36,150
Once they become a machine there,
they want to continue to extract money 

968
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,620
in any way they can.
Once they have that process going,

969
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:43,800
they want to continue and if it just 
means arresting more people and locking 

970
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:47,701
them up in their houses because the 
house make money every for every person 

971
00:43:47,701 --> 00:43:47,701
in that house,
you get x amount of dollars a year.

972
00:43:47,770 --> 00:43:49,270
The more people you get,
the more money we get.

973
00:43:49,271 --> 00:43:54,271
The more laws on the books and more 
people will get to the more laws that 

974
00:43:54,271 --> 00:43:54,400
were on the books,
the more money we'll will our,

975
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:58,330
our organism will get.
And every one of these corporations,

976
00:43:58,331 --> 00:44:00,250
every one of them,
whether it's fucking,

977
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:04,090
whether it's target or whether it's fill
in the blank,

978
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,650
you know,
starbucks,

979
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,750
they all want to grow every year.
They want to grow,

980
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:09,370
they want to get bigger and bigger and 
bigger.

981
00:44:09,371 --> 00:44:11,320
No one wants to taper off.
Hey,

982
00:44:11,321 --> 00:44:13,150
we've been doing good for about 10 years
guys.

983
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:16,630
Um,
my house is pretty much paid off.

984
00:44:16,631 --> 00:44:18,820
Like let's just taper off.
I don't need more money.

985
00:44:18,821 --> 00:44:20,080
I don't need a boat.
Come on man.

986
00:44:20,081 --> 00:44:22,600
If I had a boat out of a fixed the boat 
and cleaned the boat,

987
00:44:22,601 --> 00:44:24,040
fuck that.
Nobody does that.

988
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:29,430
So when you deal with a company like 
target or you deal with a company like a

989
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:32,400
Bob's prisons or whatever the fuck is,
it's the same thing.

990
00:44:32,401 --> 00:44:34,970
You're allowing someone to make money 
doing.

991
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:35,740
Well,
I think,

992
00:44:35,830 --> 00:44:37,450
I think you nailed the heart of the 
issue,

993
00:44:37,451 --> 00:44:42,451
which is these institutions are there to
extract money and if we can get a better

994
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:46,350
form of money then even though we're 
still gonna,

995
00:44:46,370 --> 00:44:51,370
have people doing human things which 
involves making as much money as 

996
00:44:51,370 --> 00:44:54,901
possible.
If they're actually using more fair 

997
00:44:54,901 --> 00:44:57,421
money,
then we can track that flow and it can 

998
00:44:57,421 --> 00:45:00,001
be done in a more fair way.
Like I'm pretty convinced that a lot of 

999
00:45:00,001 --> 00:45:03,241
the shit we see in terms of 
militarization and all the military 

1000
00:45:03,241 --> 00:45:07,081
industrial complex and whatnot,
it's because of the way our financial 

1001
00:45:07,081 --> 00:45:11,851
system works,
that we have the government to go back 

1002
00:45:11,851 --> 00:45:13,600
to comparing government to the church 
from a few hundred years ago.

1003
00:45:13,930 --> 00:45:18,930
He had this organization that is beyond 
the average person's understanding and 

1004
00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:23,581
they're the ones in charge of money and 
it's very unscientific and it's kind of 

1005
00:45:23,581 --> 00:45:23,581
mysterious.

1006
00:45:23,581 --> 00:45:28,440
And it seems like that money always 
loops back around and goes to these 

1007
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:30,390
kinds of organizations like,
um,

1008
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:31,240
like,
uh,

1009
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:35,650
companies that lobby for prison 
contracts and not to the individual.

1010
00:45:35,830 --> 00:45:36,150
You know,
there's,

1011
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:38,530
there's an intrinsic problem there.
And,

1012
00:45:38,531 --> 00:45:41,230
uh,
based on what I've researched,

1013
00:45:41,231 --> 00:45:44,260
I really think that this whole currency 
revolution is going to fix a lot of that

1014
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,120
so we're still going to have shitty 
problems,

1015
00:45:46,121 --> 00:45:51,121
but it's going to be a lot harder in 10 
years to be a Booz Allen Hamilton or a,

1016
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:54,970
a Lockheed Martin or whatever,
and do the creepy stuff.

1017
00:45:54,971 --> 00:45:56,590
You'll still be able to do the good 
stuff,

1018
00:45:56,980 --> 00:46:00,730
but the creepier sides are going to be 
just really hard to justify because that

1019
00:46:00,731 --> 00:46:02,590
money is going to have to come from 
somewhere.

1020
00:46:03,070 --> 00:46:06,520
Like in the same way that those tipping 
services are taking off a.

1021
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:10,330
every citizen is going to have some say 
over where their money actually goes.

1022
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,460
And that sounds like it's very 
futuristic still.

1023
00:46:12,461 --> 00:46:17,461
But it's going to happen I think faster 
than people realize because it's 

1024
00:46:17,461 --> 00:46:17,461
happening.
You know?

1025
00:46:17,461 --> 00:46:18,410
Well,
if that's the case,

1026
00:46:18,411 --> 00:46:22,250
it's going to be a weird world to see 
companies,

1027
00:46:22,251 --> 00:46:26,330
corporations become accountable and 
started having to address and adjust.

1028
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:30,590
And if you force them to be accountable,
they're essentially comprised at people.

1029
00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:35,330
If the people at the top end of the 
spectrum or not just being forced to act

1030
00:46:35,331 --> 00:46:40,331
ethically but are encouraged to and are 
empowered by doing so,

1031
00:46:41,270 --> 00:46:44,010
like they get to feel good about the 
fact that look,

1032
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:47,180
everybody can make a living and not 
raped the world.

1033
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:50,390
It is possible.
I mean just the idea that capitalism has

1034
00:46:50,391 --> 00:46:53,180
to be this monster that doesn't give a 
fuck about anything but money.

1035
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:58,130
That's only because we've allowed it to 
be that we haven't liked strained it,

1036
00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:03,220
constrained it with ethics and morals 
and essentially that's the case with 

1037
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:05,060
human beings.
Psychopaths come from.

1038
00:47:05,061 --> 00:47:07,640
When you think murderers and fucking 
warlords come from.

1039
00:47:07,641 --> 00:47:09,440
I don't think it's a human being,
but hold on.

1040
00:47:09,441 --> 00:47:11,810
That's a human being that hasn't been 
constrained,

1041
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:13,220
right?
I mean that's what it is.

1042
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,140
It's a human being that hasn't been 
like,

1043
00:47:15,141 --> 00:47:20,141
hey,
you need to develop along the way a 

1044
00:47:20,141 --> 00:47:20,141
series a,
a set of ethics,

1045
00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:25,150
morals.
We become a good person or you could 

1046
00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:28,541
become a good company as well,
or you can kind of bribed your way 

1047
00:47:28,541 --> 00:47:30,040
through the maze to get to the top and 
be

1048
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:33,060
this fucking evil whoremonger murderer,
cat.

1049
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:35,830
And that's possible too.
And that we've seen both.

1050
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:41,190
Yeah.
I think just that you say with ethics 

1051
00:47:41,190 --> 00:47:41,190
and morals,
that's important,

1052
00:47:41,190 --> 00:47:42,640
but there's no way to screen for that.
You know.

1053
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:46,840
So I think what's really going to help 
us out is just promoting better forms of

1054
00:47:46,841 --> 00:47:47,980
technology.
Like we can.

1055
00:47:48,550 --> 00:47:50,170
We can give every new cop,
you know,

1056
00:47:50,171 --> 00:47:53,860
the full star Trek Federation lesson and
you know,

1057
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:59,160
don't you know the,
the prime directive don't do harm to 

1058
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:01,801
others.
We can give them the whole download in 

1059
00:48:01,801 --> 00:48:02,410
terms of morality.
They might skip that lesson,

1060
00:48:02,411 --> 00:48:07,411
they might not actually get that,
but if they have a body camera on them 

1061
00:48:07,411 --> 00:48:07,570
at all hours,
they're on duty.

1062
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:12,800
It doesn't really matter because we're 
going to have some accountability and 

1063
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:13,270
that's due to technology.
And I think with this bitcoin stuff,

1064
00:48:13,271 --> 00:48:18,271
it's the same way,
like you're still going to have shitty 

1065
00:48:18,271 --> 00:48:18,760
governments and shitty people and greedy
corporations,

1066
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:23,940
but now somebody can actually track all 
of it and we can watch it happening in 

1067
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:23,940
real time.

1068
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:24,530
And that right there,
you know,

1069
00:48:24,550 --> 00:48:29,550
even if I didn't own any that right 
there is enough of an upgrade that I'd 

1070
00:48:29,550 --> 00:48:32,791
be willing to fight for it because what 
we have right now is fucking chaos and 

1071
00:48:32,791 --> 00:48:36,571
it's not working for anybody.
It's going to be really interesting to 

1072
00:48:36,571 --> 00:48:38,080
see if something like Bitcoin or 
ultimately whatever coin it is,

1073
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:42,430
if it does become big enough that it has
a significant impact on the world.

1074
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,680
Because as soon as that does happen,
if the,

1075
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:50,250
if the balance starts to sway in that 
direction and people start hopping on 

1076
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:54,601
that and then that becomes the way 
people start exchanging goods and 

1077
00:48:54,601 --> 00:48:58,630
purchasing things.
It could really be a monumental shift in

1078
00:48:58,631 --> 00:49:03,631
human culture.
I mean really be like the first time 

1079
00:49:03,631 --> 00:49:06,151
ever people have a full say.
And if people really do get to that 

1080
00:49:07,631 --> 00:49:12,631
state where we no longer need a bank,
I mean that's just what a giant chunk of

1081
00:49:14,081 --> 00:49:19,081
the economy would be eliminated with a 
giant chunk of the people that control 

1082
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:22,090
massive amounts of resources and money.

1083
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:27,540
There would be just shit out of luck.
There's a whole class of people in New 

1084
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:27,790
York that are basically professional 
money,

1085
00:49:27,791 --> 00:49:32,791
men and many women and they will go away
and they will be the most unmissed class

1086
00:49:33,671 --> 00:49:36,820
of people in human history.
Notoriously ruthless.

1087
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:37,210
Yeah.
No,

1088
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:42,240
totally selfish.
Took money from taxpayers and then 

1089
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,810
turned around and still foreclosed on 
all these millions of people.

1090
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:45,350
And it's not all of them.
I mean,

1091
00:49:45,351 --> 00:49:50,351
some of them are great.
I'm sure that the financial system that 

1092
00:49:50,351 --> 00:49:54,840
is,
it's like if you work in a 

1093
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:54,840
slaughterhouse,
you might be the best butcher there.

1094
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:56,020
You're still in a house,
you know?

1095
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:57,970
And that's,
that's the system they work in.

1096
00:49:57,971 --> 00:50:02,971
And this,
what makes bitcoin so different is that 

1097
00:50:02,971 --> 00:50:03,610
it wasn't designed to make money off of 
people.

1098
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:08,640
You know?
I guess we can't tell what his 

1099
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:08,640
intentions were,
but the way it works,

1100
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:09,580
it doesn't need to make a lot of money 
off of you to send money.

1101
00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:14,810
It's not like a fee based thing.
What doesn't make sense about how much 

1102
00:50:14,810 --> 00:50:16,810
money bankers make?
What are you doing?

1103
00:50:16,811 --> 00:50:21,811
You just move money around.
You get so much of it that you get to 

1104
00:50:21,811 --> 00:50:21,811
buy a castle.
Oh,

1105
00:50:21,811 --> 00:50:26,090
they buy ads on TV convincing you to 
sign up for a 401k and then they make 

1106
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:28,040
their money on the management fee.
How much do you think

1107
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:31,310
they're given Samuel Jackson to do those
goddamn capital one commercials?

1108
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:34,700
Maybe they paid off his credit cards a 
few times,

1109
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:37,160
but Samuel Jackson is a wealthy man.
I mean,

1110
00:50:37,161 --> 00:50:42,161
he's a huge actor.
He said one of the biggest actors in 

1111
00:50:42,161 --> 00:50:42,161
Hollywood,
still to this day,

1112
00:50:42,161 --> 00:50:45,110
how can they pay him to do that?
I don't know if they gave him a price.

1113
00:50:45,111 --> 00:50:50,111
That's right.
It's probably not that much time in 

1114
00:50:50,111 --> 00:50:51,791
front of a green screen,
but there's a lot of actors that are 

1115
00:50:51,791 --> 00:50:51,791
starting to do those.
They're doing capital one commercials.

1116
00:50:51,791 --> 00:50:53,360
They're doing like Alec,
Alec Baldwin.

1117
00:50:53,390 --> 00:50:54,710
Yeah.
That's weird.

1118
00:50:55,090 --> 00:50:56,810
Seems to.
It seems odd.

1119
00:50:56,930 --> 00:51:01,930
It seems odd bullets because banks are 
mostly psychological so they have to 

1120
00:51:01,930 --> 00:51:02,150
keep raising the bar to keep our 
attention.

1121
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:07,420
Yeah.
But why would the movie stars be 

1122
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:07,420
interested in doing that?
I mean these are wealthy people.

1123
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:07,730
That's what's confusing to me.

1124
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:09,650
You should get them in here and I don't 
want to.

1125
00:51:09,890 --> 00:51:10,660
You don't want.
It's okay.

1126
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:13,430
No,
you think it's probably just easy access

1127
00:51:13,431 --> 00:51:18,431
to money I guess.
I mean I guess it's just a shit ton of 

1128
00:51:18,431 --> 00:51:21,551
money to do a little work,
but it seems like how much money they 

1129
00:51:21,551 --> 00:51:25,300
have.
I mean you're talking about are really 

1130
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:25,300
wealthy people,
it seems like,

1131
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:28,900
especially with Samuel Jackson.
So what is he like 65 or something like 

1132
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:29,290
that at a certain point in time and 
already a legend.

1133
00:51:29,291 --> 00:51:34,291
I mean you can't,
no matter what happens after pulp 

1134
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:34,291
fiction,
he's a great actor forever.

1135
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:35,510
You know,
you have a lot of actors.

1136
00:51:35,511 --> 00:51:38,360
They fuck it up towards the end.
There's a lot of actors,

1137
00:51:38,361 --> 00:51:42,590
like towards the end they start sort of,
it all kind of fades off,

1138
00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:47,870
you know,
and they start doing like those Robert 

1139
00:51:47,870 --> 00:51:47,870
De Niro movies that he's been doing 
lately.

1140
00:51:47,870 --> 00:51:50,300
You know,
Robert Deniro was doing fucking God damn

1141
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:55,360
terrible movies lately.
I watched one of them he did with John 

1142
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:57,440
Travolta and I was like,
what did they pay him to do this?

1143
00:51:57,441 --> 00:52:02,441
This is ridiculous.
Some John Travolta plays like the worst 

1144
00:52:02,441 --> 00:52:06,220
Russian accent ever.
It's the both like killers and John 

1145
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:08,330
Travolta's chasing him through the 
woods.

1146
00:52:08,331 --> 00:52:10,010
They're shooting arrows at each other.
It's like,

1147
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,440
it's so stupid.
It's so stupid.

1148
00:52:12,441 --> 00:52:14,210
You,
you watched the preview and you see like

1149
00:52:14,211 --> 00:52:17,830
the obvious stuntman that's falling down
and like,

1150
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:19,970
what am I.
This is an episode of the $6,000,000

1151
00:52:19,971 --> 00:52:22,530
man that he turned into a fucking movie 
like this.

1152
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:25,730
It's so fucking bad.
Well,

1153
00:52:25,731 --> 00:52:27,010
he was great.
And uh,

1154
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:29,720
what were they?
Meet the fockers all those.

1155
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:30,290
Oh yeah.
Well,

1156
00:52:30,291 --> 00:52:31,550
he's creating a lot.
I mean,

1157
00:52:31,790 --> 00:52:36,790
look,
he's one of the greatest actors of all 

1158
00:52:36,790 --> 00:52:36,790
time.
Region,

1159
00:52:36,790 --> 00:52:36,790
bowl,
deer,

1160
00:52:36,790 --> 00:52:36,790
hunter,
taxi driver.

1161
00:52:36,790 --> 00:52:37,430
I mean,
you can't,

1162
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:41,460
we can't take away what he's done,
but I think they get to a certain point.

1163
00:52:41,510 --> 00:52:42,230
I'm like,
fucking,

1164
00:52:42,231 --> 00:52:44,120
who cares?
Give me the check.

1165
00:52:44,121 --> 00:52:46,370
I'll do your stupid fucking movie.
Oh,

1166
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:51,371
okay.
Travolta and I were in the woods 

1167
00:52:51,371 --> 00:52:51,371
shooting arrows at me.
All right,

1168
00:52:51,371 --> 00:52:51,371
let's go.
It's like Pierce Brosnan.

1169
00:52:51,371 --> 00:52:54,440
He's been in a couple of kind of lower 
end things and he was bond not that long

1170
00:52:54,441 --> 00:52:55,350
ago.
Yeah.

1171
00:52:55,390 --> 00:52:57,650
He was like the least believable bond 
ever.

1172
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:58,670
Like,
I'm like,

1173
00:52:58,671 --> 00:53:02,510
this guy ain't kicking no one's ass.
He's breaking his own hands.

1174
00:53:02,511 --> 00:53:03,590
Like,
this is not the.

1175
00:53:03,690 --> 00:53:06,110
He's not going to knock people out.
He's of hurt himself.

1176
00:53:06,170 --> 00:53:07,610
You think Daniel Craig is more 
believable?

1177
00:53:07,611 --> 00:53:09,800
He's the most believable ever.
For sure.

1178
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,960
He's the only guy.
Like you look at him with his shirt off,

1179
00:53:11,970 --> 00:53:13,070
you know,
that guy's a killer.

1180
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:14,510
Like he looks like a real killer.

1181
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:16,480
It looks like he could fuck you up.
You know,

1182
00:53:16,510 --> 00:53:18,770
you look at Pierce Brosnan with his 
shirt off and you're like,

1183
00:53:18,771 --> 00:53:21,110
this guy,
all you have to do is run up a flight of

1184
00:53:21,111 --> 00:53:24,110
stairs and wait for him.
Like he's not going to make it.

1185
00:53:24,450 --> 00:53:27,060
It's not kicking everybody's ass better.
Be Quick.

1186
00:53:27,610 --> 00:53:32,610
If he kicks your ass better,
not take time because he's not going to 

1187
00:53:32,610 --> 00:53:33,110
be there 30,
40 seconds into this.

1188
00:53:33,111 --> 00:53:35,700
This is not going to be.
He's going to be huffing and puffing.

1189
00:53:35,701 --> 00:53:37,230
It's going to be over.
He's more of a gun,

1190
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:40,740
a gun based bond.
He's a pretty man is very,

1191
00:53:40,770 --> 00:53:42,480
very nice hair,
you know,

1192
00:53:42,570 --> 00:53:46,650
but I don't buy them as like a bad ass 
like beating people up.

1193
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:48,480
They could get away with that back in 
the day.

1194
00:53:48,690 --> 00:53:53,690
Like if you go back and watch the 
original Batman and robin like Adam 

1195
00:53:53,690 --> 00:53:53,690
West,
Adam West,

1196
00:53:53,690 --> 00:53:58,350
it looked like maybe someone made them 
do a pushup at one point in time.

1197
00:53:58,410 --> 00:54:01,860
You know what I mean?
But it in no way shape or form.

1198
00:54:01,890 --> 00:54:03,490
Do you look like an athlete?
You know,

1199
00:54:03,510 --> 00:54:06,930
he didn't look like my Christian Bale 
nightclub.

1200
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:10,000
Exactly like Christian Bale and Batman 
was.

1201
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:12,720
He's a monster.
He looks like a bad ass.

1202
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:17,840
Which is pretty impressive because 
that's coming off just like six months 

1203
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:21,350
from him doing the machinists where he 
got down to some ungodly low weight.

1204
00:54:21,541 --> 00:54:25,260
Like I think he was like 140 pounds or 
something like that and he's a big guy.

1205
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:27,570
It might even been lower.
Yeah,

1206
00:54:27,590 --> 00:54:29,380
he's the real deal.
Oh,

1207
00:54:29,410 --> 00:54:34,410
talking about good actors,
no one is come closer to dying for a 

1208
00:54:34,410 --> 00:54:35,610
role.
Then that guy did in a role that sucked.

1209
00:54:35,910 --> 00:54:38,480
I mean that movie sucked.
I didn't see the machinists.

1210
00:54:38,850 --> 00:54:40,260
It was okay,
but it was not.

1211
00:54:40,290 --> 00:54:45,290
Not The movie you want almost die for,
but you got to think also that a guy 

1212
00:54:45,290 --> 00:54:49,731
that's losing that much weight and 
essentially starving himself to death 

1213
00:54:49,731 --> 00:54:49,731
like that.

1214
00:54:49,731 --> 00:54:51,690
Like that guy doesn't have much energy 
to act either.

1215
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:55,440
That's the catch 22.
It's like you lose that much weight,

1216
00:54:55,500 --> 00:55:00,500
like your body is fucking struggling.
Like everything is hard to do.

1217
00:55:00,691 --> 00:55:01,980
Getting up out of bed.
It's hard to do.

1218
00:55:02,130 --> 00:55:07,130
You're dying.
Your body body's eating itself and the 

1219
00:55:07,130 --> 00:55:10,461
only way to get that,
that lean in that thin there is on the 

1220
00:55:10,461 --> 00:55:10,461
left.
Wow,

1221
00:55:10,461 --> 00:55:11,780
that's incredible.
That's him on the right.

1222
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:14,910
Six months later that it's unreal.
Yeah,

1223
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:19,200
but that's shit that he did to himself 
to get to the guy on the left.

1224
00:55:19,530 --> 00:55:21,570
He probably ruined his organs.
I mean,

1225
00:55:21,571 --> 00:55:25,200
he probably took years off of his life.
Very,

1226
00:55:25,201 --> 00:55:27,600
very,
very hard on your body to get that thin.

1227
00:55:28,110 --> 00:55:30,960
You're eating yourself.
Your body starts atrophying.

1228
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:34,110
It starts absorbing its own muscle 
tissue and stay alive.

1229
00:55:34,170 --> 00:55:35,910
It's [inaudible].
That's where you're getting your protein

1230
00:55:35,911 --> 00:55:39,150
from to eating its own body as fucked.

1231
00:55:39,610 --> 00:55:43,440
That is fucked for a goofy movie.
Fifty cents.

1232
00:55:43,441 --> 00:55:48,441
Did it too for something people are 
going to make fun of on a podcast years 

1233
00:55:48,441 --> 00:55:48,441
later.
Well,

1234
00:55:48,441 --> 00:55:50,540
some people might have enjoyed it and I 
don't know,

1235
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:52,830
just I didn't think it was that good and
he's.

1236
00:55:52,890 --> 00:55:55,260
He's a great actor.
I love them in a lot of things.

1237
00:55:55,670 --> 00:55:58,740
It's just that wasn't.
It wasn't worth fucking doing,

1238
00:55:58,741 --> 00:56:00,210
man.
Jesus Christ.

1239
00:56:01,710 --> 00:56:03,030
How do we get on him?
Losing weight?

1240
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:05,070
How the fuck did we even go down this 
road?

1241
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,490
I'm not sure.
Probably through bitcoin somewhere.

1242
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,060
Another.
I want to drive home.

1243
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:11,250
The bitcoin thing that like everybody 
out there,

1244
00:56:11,730 --> 00:56:14,010
it's too late because you were saying 
like,

1245
00:56:14,011 --> 00:56:15,570
would it be cool if,
if it would happen,

1246
00:56:15,571 --> 00:56:16,620
it's sort of is,
you know,

1247
00:56:16,950 --> 00:56:21,950
this is the point where people who are 
not tech savvy and not Bill Gates or 

1248
00:56:21,950 --> 00:56:24,040
Richard Branson need to look into it 
because those

1249
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:26,710
people have already made their,
their beds.

1250
00:56:26,711 --> 00:56:27,970
You know,
like Richard Branson,

1251
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:33,620
very much a believer in bitcoin.
Bill Gates went on Bloomberg and said 

1252
00:56:34,031 --> 00:56:39,031
Bitcoin is better than currency.
Like that was only part of his 

1253
00:56:39,031 --> 00:56:41,731
statement.
It was like bitcoin is better than 

1254
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:41,731
currency in that.
And then he explained why,

1255
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:45,430
but what's so weird about that is Bill 
Gates back in 1995 was on Letterman,

1256
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:51,120
basically the same kind of interview,
but about the Internet and the audience 

1257
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:54,901
back then thought he was just as full of
shit as people today think bitcoin is 

1258
00:56:54,901 --> 00:56:55,870
kind of this,
this fad,

1259
00:56:56,170 --> 00:56:59,920
when it's really not like Bill Gates 
isn't in the pumping bullshit business.

1260
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:01,210
Well here's the reality

1261
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:05,140
of Bitcoin or have anything that's not a
fully formed.

1262
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:09,700
Absolutely successful shift.
Okay.

1263
00:57:09,810 --> 00:57:11,440
Whatever it is,
we don't know.

1264
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:14,020
We don't know.
We might think that bitcoin is it and it

1265
00:57:14,021 --> 00:57:15,430
might become,
what's that other stuff?

1266
00:57:15,431 --> 00:57:17,300
Doge coin and Doggy coin,
whatever.

1267
00:57:18,030 --> 00:57:20,050
There are hundreds of them now.
There's hundreds of them,

1268
00:57:20,051 --> 00:57:24,520
so there might be one that comes along a
few years from now that's like ethically

1269
00:57:24,521 --> 00:57:29,521
engineered.
Somebody comes along and some great 

1270
00:57:29,521 --> 00:57:32,221
minds,
mathematicians and economists get 

1271
00:57:32,221 --> 00:57:34,681
together and they come up with a formula
that everyone agrees to and they launch 

1272
00:57:34,681 --> 00:57:36,760
it and it's like the fucking large 
Hadron collider where you get 10,000

1273
00:57:36,761 --> 00:57:41,761
scientists from 100 different countries 
working on this one project and they 

1274
00:57:41,761 --> 00:57:45,190
come up with a universal form of 
currency and essentially figure out some

1275
00:57:45,191 --> 00:57:50,190
sort of a way to slowly but surely even 
out the the,

1276
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:55,300
the cultures financial,
a distribution of wealth and that's like

1277
00:57:55,490 --> 00:57:56,860
a huge issue with people.

1278
00:57:56,890 --> 00:58:01,890
The distribution of wealth.
That's some because some people are 

1279
00:58:01,890 --> 00:58:01,890
like,
fuck you man,

1280
00:58:01,890 --> 00:58:02,740
I earned this money,
and then some people are like,

1281
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:07,800
fuck you.
The only way you could have that much 

1282
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:09,541
money is if you've done something wrong 
or if you found a loophole in a system 

1283
00:58:09,541 --> 00:58:13,231
that was absolutely unjust and once that
loopholes been created and once that 

1284
00:58:13,231 --> 00:58:16,951
position has been established,
it's almost impossible to even things 

1285
00:58:16,951 --> 00:58:16,951
out.
This is not an even playing field,

1286
00:58:16,951 --> 00:58:20,230
especially if you inherited that money 
or you got an a fucking divorce,

1287
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:21,820
you know,
like all that kind of shit.

1288
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:24,040
That's why this is so brilliant.
I mean that,

1289
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:26,950
that innovation of the money being 
created through mining,

1290
00:58:27,260 --> 00:58:30,460
it was a pretty smart idea because now 
the distribution is,

1291
00:58:30,461 --> 00:58:32,080
for lack of a better word,
fair.

1292
00:58:32,290 --> 00:58:35,290
And even today,
like when I left the house,

1293
00:58:35,590 --> 00:58:38,840
bitcoin was at around $380,
three 85 chicken every day.

1294
00:58:38,930 --> 00:58:40,750
Stock Market.
I do you one of those freaks.

1295
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:46,240
Uh,
I just check it because I can't not 

1296
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:46,490
check it.
It's not so much about that.

1297
00:58:46,491 --> 00:58:51,110
It's just interesting to watch.
So it was around 380 something and I was

1298
00:58:51,111 --> 00:58:53,150
thinking about how people go,
oh,

1299
00:58:53,151 --> 00:58:55,010
three 80,
that's too expensive for a bitcoin.

1300
00:58:55,011 --> 00:58:56,570
I'm not,
I'm going to wait until it drops,

1301
00:58:57,110 --> 00:58:59,300
right.
What you're actually buying is.

1302
00:58:59,750 --> 00:59:04,750
So one bitcoin equals 1 million bits and
already some of those services like a 

1303
00:59:05,570 --> 00:59:10,570
light change tip or switching over to 
bits instead of bitcoins because it's 

1304
00:59:10,570 --> 00:59:10,570
easier for the mind,
you know,

1305
00:59:10,570 --> 00:59:13,850
it's easier to say you've received 5,000
bits than point zero five,

1306
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:14,600
you know,
whatever.

1307
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:18,680
Um,
so that is happening.

1308
00:59:18,681 --> 00:59:21,800
And I think that in a few years' time,
maybe like years from now,

1309
00:59:22,670 --> 00:59:24,560
people will look back on this era and 
go,

1310
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:29,561
Holy Shit.
That was insanely undervalued because 

1311
00:59:29,561 --> 00:59:30,920
that's what happened four years ago.
Like my whole thesis,

1312
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:33,290
my thesis is that we have bitcoin in 
five years.

1313
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:34,400
Well that,
that's possible too,

1314
00:59:34,401 --> 00:59:39,401
but if it does happen,
I think that it's one of those things 

1315
00:59:39,401 --> 00:59:41,270
where we are not even in the,
like I think um,

1316
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:46,780
there's a,
there's a cycle to a product and we're 

1317
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:46,780
not even in the first stage of that 
cycle

1318
00:59:46,870 --> 00:59:51,870
maybe.
Or it's like Betamax looked promising 

1319
00:59:51,870 --> 00:59:55,141
and fucking fizzled off way before.
And then something that wasn't even as 

1320
00:59:55,141 --> 00:59:58,621
good became much more successful.
But I think we can agree then that one 

1321
00:59:58,621 --> 01:00:00,220
of these cryptocurrencies is gonna is 
gonna work.

1322
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:05,520
Hopefully that guy,
it might not be one of the ones that's 

1323
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:08,461
currently available.
I mean these cryptocurrencies didn't 

1324
01:00:08,461 --> 01:00:08,461
exist a decade ago.
I mean,

1325
01:00:08,461 --> 01:00:09,910
think about that.
A decade is a very brief window in time.

1326
01:00:09,911 --> 01:00:12,490
It is 2004.
No cryptocurrencies,

1327
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:14,470
2014 over a hundred.
I mean,

1328
01:00:14,471 --> 01:00:17,470
how many other there are hundreds,
hundreds and thousands.

1329
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:18,860
Well,
let's think about this.

1330
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,230
Let's say a lot.
So

1331
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:23,090
coin one of the lingering problems is 
like,

1332
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:28,100
all right,
you have bitcoin and it has whatever 

1333
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:30,681
economic value it ends up having a.
and you say you can use it as money and 

1334
01:00:30,681 --> 01:00:34,461
that's great,
but what you still have that's an issue 

1335
01:00:34,461 --> 01:00:37,010
is the need for financial institutions.
If I want to earn interest on my 

1336
01:00:37,010 --> 01:00:37,740
Bitcoin,
I have to give it to somebody,

1337
01:00:38,210 --> 01:00:43,210
right?
But why do you have to earn interest on 

1338
01:00:43,210 --> 01:00:43,210
your money?
What?

1339
01:00:43,210 --> 01:00:43,850
That's like a firmly established thing 
and people's minds that you have money,

1340
01:00:43,851 --> 01:00:46,180
you put it away somewhere when you earn 
interest.

1341
01:00:46,210 --> 01:00:48,400
Like that's just how people are trained,
you know,

1342
01:00:48,401 --> 01:00:50,570
this is stupid,
everything is stupid.

1343
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:55,600
That's really stupid.
The idea that you give your money to a 

1344
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:58,121
bank and the bank just hangs onto it and
spends it a little bit here and there 

1345
01:00:58,121 --> 01:00:58,121
and loans and out,
and then keeps as much as they can.

1346
01:00:58,121 --> 01:00:59,330
So if you ever want it back and go,

1347
01:00:59,510 --> 01:01:01,790
well it's,
it sounds stupid because it's been so,

1348
01:01:01,791 --> 01:01:06,791
uh,
it's been perverted in the favor of 

1349
01:01:06,791 --> 01:01:08,180
institutions and not in the favor of 
individuals.

1350
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:13,360
So one of these ideas is if you give 
your money to a bitcoin bank and they 

1351
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:17,411
pay you interest,
there's still the possibility that that 

1352
01:01:17,411 --> 01:01:17,870
bank can fail and they have to make the 
money somewhere.

1353
01:01:17,871 --> 01:01:21,140
So they have to loan out things and take
risks.

1354
01:01:21,141 --> 01:01:24,000
And they could fail.
There's a currency,

1355
01:01:24,020 --> 01:01:25,430
actually a bunch of them,
but I'm,

1356
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:29,960
one of them is hyper and the algorithm 
actually creates its own interest.

1357
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:32,330
So unlike bitcoin where it just sits 
there,

1358
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:35,000
this coin,
just by running it on your computer,

1359
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:40,240
you earn more of the coins.
So what they've done is created so that 

1360
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:43,661
anybody with just a normal computer can 
run the software that actually creates 

1361
01:01:43,661 --> 01:01:47,381
more currency for that network.
Because with bitcoin you can only do 

1362
01:01:47,381 --> 01:01:47,750
that if you're running the mining 
hardware,

1363
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:49,580
which is really kind of expensive and 
observe

1364
01:01:49,630 --> 01:01:50,960
you're at work.
Those,

1365
01:01:51,290 --> 01:01:56,290
is that an infant growth paradigm is 
that the idea behind it just continues 

1366
01:01:56,290 --> 01:01:57,590
on forever and ever and continues to 
generate interest.

1367
01:01:57,740 --> 01:02:02,060
It doesn't continue forever because it 
in five years it scales down and then it

1368
01:02:02,061 --> 01:02:04,790
scales down again that scales down 
through the software,

1369
01:02:05,450 --> 01:02:08,720
through the schedule.
It's all been scheduled at the same with

1370
01:02:08,721 --> 01:02:10,010
Bitcoin,
with Bitcoin,

1371
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:12,680
the bitcoin is just the amount that gets
made.

1372
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:13,710
The last

1373
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:16,830
I'm using the word interest,
what it really is,

1374
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:19,050
is they found a way to,
um,

1375
01:02:19,290 --> 01:02:24,290
with Bitcoin,
the miners are the ones who are earning 

1376
01:02:24,290 --> 01:02:24,990
new coins by running that algorithm.
This algorithm,

1377
01:02:25,410 --> 01:02:30,410
just by running the wallet,
you're supporting the network and 

1378
01:02:30,410 --> 01:02:30,960
running those transactions for people.
So as a result,

1379
01:02:30,961 --> 01:02:32,760
you're going to get a percentage of 
those coins.

1380
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:36,060
And so they've just kind of democratized
the mining process.

1381
01:02:36,061 --> 01:02:39,690
So now every single user is essentially 
a minor and it changes the way you think

1382
01:02:39,691 --> 01:02:42,750
about money because with Bitcoin,
what bitcoin did is,

1383
01:02:42,751 --> 01:02:47,751
you know,
underneath the central bank to issue 

1384
01:02:47,751 --> 01:02:47,751
money,
you now have money.

1385
01:02:47,751 --> 01:02:47,760
It just exists.
And with things like hyper,

1386
01:02:47,761 --> 01:02:52,761
you no longer have the need for a bank 
to issue interests because the coin 

1387
01:02:52,761 --> 01:02:56,571
itself is capable of bearing interest.
So you have something that just cannot 

1388
01:02:56,571 --> 01:02:57,970
be corrupted by any kind of,
um,

1389
01:02:58,280 --> 01:02:59,960
yeah.
But who the fuck is using hyper?

1390
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:02,390
Is it one percent of the people that use
bitcoin?

1391
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:03,680
Is it even that,
you know,

1392
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:08,920
how many people are using bitcoin?
That's a tiny percentage of the 

1393
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:11,441
population of renting.
So you're dealing with a tiny 

1394
01:03:11,441 --> 01:03:11,441
percentage,
a tiny percentage.

1395
01:03:11,441 --> 01:03:11,441
It's still very.

1396
01:03:11,441 --> 01:03:15,920
It's used by Gamers and online worlds,
which was fucking gamers.

1397
01:03:16,010 --> 01:03:18,320
The online world thing is becoming more 
of a,

1398
01:03:18,530 --> 01:03:23,530
an economy because in a few years people
are going to have oculus rifts on and 

1399
01:03:23,530 --> 01:03:27,760
they're going to be exploring around in 
their living rooms and even though 

1400
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:28,520
they're just on a video game,
everything they do has some kind of real

1401
01:03:28,521 --> 01:03:33,521
economic value.
If you can port that value in somehow 

1402
01:03:33,521 --> 01:03:33,770
you could do neat thing.

1403
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,190
We're going to be in the Matrix inside 
of 20 years.

1404
01:03:36,230 --> 01:03:38,780
In 20 years we're going to be just like 
Keanu Reeves,

1405
01:03:38,810 --> 01:03:40,960
a big fucking Frisbee in the back of her
head,

1406
01:03:41,140 --> 01:03:46,140
kind of connected to a tube.
You think we'll have to write into the 

1407
01:03:46,140 --> 01:03:47,350
system and go out full ai within 20 
years so you can just ask Siri and it's.

1408
01:03:47,470 --> 01:03:49,780
Yeah,
I think you'll have robots.

1409
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:54,340
You'll have like a person like a robot 
Butler or something like that that hands

1410
01:03:54,341 --> 01:03:59,341
around hangs around your house and hands
you things and does things for you and 

1411
01:03:59,341 --> 01:04:00,560
schedules things.
If the robot girlfriend while you.

1412
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:05,700
That's going to be an ethical dilemma,
but I think that's probably coming to 

1413
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:05,860
ethical dilemma I've already resolved.
Yeah,

1414
01:04:05,861 --> 01:04:09,520
you were cool with it.
I'm set just fucking around,

1415
01:04:09,521 --> 01:04:11,830
but I want you to suck it up.
You're telling the truth.

1416
01:04:11,831 --> 01:04:15,250
If you've had a really hot like traci 
lords in her prime robot,

1417
01:04:15,260 --> 01:04:15,500
fuck.

1418
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,580
If I really couldn't tell the difference
and other people couldn't either.

1419
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:24,000
That's where the problem sets and like,
well why wouldn't you order when she 

1420
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:24,000
starts crying when you leave and you're 
like,

1421
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:24,880
what the fuck?
I didn't know that.

1422
01:04:25,420 --> 01:04:26,470
Well,
it's like an interstellar.

1423
01:04:26,471 --> 01:04:28,090
You have to deprogram.
I didn't see it.

1424
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:30,550
Don't give any spoilers.
You fuck up,

1425
01:04:30,580 --> 01:04:32,340
dare you.
This boilers,

1426
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:37,400
the,
the idea of ais is very captivating and 

1427
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:41,380
the idea of Ai to me is very similar to 
the idea of what must have been the idea

1428
01:04:41,381 --> 01:04:43,480
of the atomic bomb before it was 
initially dropped.

1429
01:04:43,990 --> 01:04:46,270
I think the idea of doing it,
it's almost,

1430
01:04:46,660 --> 01:04:49,270
it's so compelling.
It's impossible to not do it.

1431
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:51,250
And in that case,
like with the atomic bomb,

1432
01:04:51,251 --> 01:04:54,190
of course it was like during the war and
they were worried about the Nazis coming

1433
01:04:54,191 --> 01:04:57,340
up with it first,
but if there was no war going on,

1434
01:04:57,370 --> 01:05:00,520
I'm pretty sure they were still wouldn't
come up with the fucking atomic bomb.

1435
01:05:00,580 --> 01:05:01,900
They just would have,
you know,

1436
01:05:01,901 --> 01:05:03,970
especially if they were worried that 
somebody else would have first,

1437
01:05:03,971 --> 01:05:08,971
even if there was no war.
But it's one of those things where once 

1438
01:05:08,971 --> 01:05:09,580
you make it,
you've made it.

1439
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:14,640
The cat's out of the bag and now 
everybody knows that this is a part of 

1440
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:16,480
reality and I think that's going to be 
the case with artificial intelligence.

1441
01:05:16,481 --> 01:05:18,190
I think there's going to be a.
Once you make

1442
01:05:18,190 --> 01:05:19,300
it,
you sure?

1443
01:05:19,510 --> 01:05:20,920
Okay,
hit the button,

1444
01:05:20,921 --> 01:05:25,921
let him go live and then you know he 
starts doing things for you and you go 

1445
01:05:25,921 --> 01:05:26,050
to bed.
You get up in the mornings from in front

1446
01:05:26,051 --> 01:05:28,720
of your fucking computer and he's 
designing a far better robot.

1447
01:05:28,810 --> 01:05:31,840
It's like you've made mistakes and I 
want to correct them and here's,

1448
01:05:31,841 --> 01:05:36,841
here's the best way to design the next 
level of me and then he designs and 

1449
01:05:36,841 --> 01:05:39,550
makes the next level of him and the next
level of him kills all the people.

1450
01:05:39,551 --> 01:05:43,480
Just fucking smarter people and says,
people are a parasite live.

1451
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:48,481
We're just going to make robot.
People that don't litter don't have any 

1452
01:05:48,481 --> 01:05:52,681
problems and we're all sync up together 
on one network and our goal is to live 

1453
01:05:52,681 --> 01:05:56,791
harmoniously with all the other life 
forms on earth with nothing out of 

1454
01:05:56,791 --> 01:05:57,430
balance,
and that's we have an algorithm designed

1455
01:05:57,431 --> 01:06:02,431
to achieve that were indistinguishable 
biologically from actual people at this 

1456
01:06:02,441 --> 01:06:07,441
point,
because we're so advanced with 

1457
01:06:07,441 --> 01:06:07,441
artificial cells,
even we can't tell,

1458
01:06:07,441 --> 01:06:11,580
so what we'll do is we'll just only 
exist in this form and all these 

1459
01:06:11,580 --> 01:06:16,051
imperfect prototypes that existed 
essentially just to hatch us.

1460
01:06:16,690 --> 01:06:21,690
That's all they were.
They were just cocooning themselves 

1461
01:06:21,690 --> 01:06:21,690
until they shit out some artificial 
life.

1462
01:06:21,690 --> 01:06:23,190
Either there's gonna be a bit of a cylon
mentality then yeah,

1463
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:24,660
well,
there's going to be an elitism.

1464
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:26,110
You know,
they're going to be smarter than us.

1465
01:06:26,111 --> 01:06:31,111
They're going to be better than us,
and they're gonna realize how flawed we 

1466
01:06:31,111 --> 01:06:31,111
are.
Were we?

1467
01:06:31,111 --> 01:06:31,450
We were a biological computers,
okay,

1468
01:06:31,750 --> 01:06:36,750
but we're biological computers that were
never designed or we have been designed 

1469
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:42,240
by trial and error and natural selection
and genetics and learned behavior 

1470
01:06:43,631 --> 01:06:48,100
patterns and adapt to our environments,
but at the end of the day,

1471
01:06:48,310 --> 01:06:53,310
what they're going to be able to do if 
you really do have artificial 

1472
01:06:53,310 --> 01:06:54,610
intelligence,
so you really do create something that's

1473
01:06:54,750 --> 01:06:59,750
superintelligent artificial.
It wasn't born out of cells and mating 

1474
01:06:59,750 --> 01:07:04,561
and evolution.
Just something that a human being 

1475
01:07:04,561 --> 01:07:07,741
created,
that fucking thing's going to have some 

1476
01:07:07,741 --> 01:07:07,741
real different ideas about how to run 
shit.

1477
01:07:07,741 --> 01:07:10,600
It really is like Elon Musk warned that,
uh,

1478
01:07:11,380 --> 01:07:12,900
will be summoning the demon.
Yeah,

1479
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,020
that's what he said.
Yeah.

1480
01:07:14,290 --> 01:07:15,370
Well,
I would listen to him,

1481
01:07:15,430 --> 01:07:18,580
that guy smart as shit.
He is way fucking smarter than me.

1482
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:20,770
So if I'm worried about it,
I'm an idiot.

1483
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:24,010
Like literally what are guys who are 
actually coders?

1484
01:07:24,011 --> 01:07:25,360
What are they actually thinking?
Well,

1485
01:07:25,380 --> 01:07:26,870
it's neat how,
uh,

1486
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:31,920
there's an article in wired about this 
whole ai thing and the article was good 

1487
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:35,461
until the end when it was like,
we need to go on this journey so that 

1488
01:07:35,461 --> 01:07:38,971
these machines will tell us who we are.
And that's the part where I was like 

1489
01:07:38,971 --> 01:07:40,150
vomit because Barf,
these,

1490
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:45,240
these people who are looking at the 
singularity is this is what we need to 

1491
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:47,920
get to so they can get personal answers 
and personal meaning.

1492
01:07:48,380 --> 01:07:51,340
Have they tried first like a weed 
Brownie or something?

1493
01:07:51,341 --> 01:07:53,160
Just to be sure,
like I think the.

1494
01:07:53,460 --> 01:07:58,460
I think the answer is they're looking 
for are not going to be split up by a 

1495
01:07:58,460 --> 01:07:58,460
computer.
I think there are like personal things.

1496
01:07:58,460 --> 01:08:00,220
I don't think you ever get the answers,
man.

1497
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:04,390
I think you get some answers.
You get some peace.

1498
01:08:04,420 --> 01:08:05,620
What?
I want my money back,

1499
01:08:06,220 --> 01:08:08,860
all the answers.
There's no answers.

1500
01:08:09,140 --> 01:08:09,290
The,

1501
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:11,410
the answers to what?
Like here's the big one,

1502
01:08:11,411 --> 01:08:12,760
right?
What is the meaning of life?

1503
01:08:13,510 --> 01:08:16,100
That's a hard one to crush your enemies

1504
01:08:16,790 --> 01:08:21,790
there.
The three driven them before you knew 

1505
01:08:21,790 --> 01:08:23,360
the laminations of the women laminations
limitations and the limitations of their

1506
01:08:23,420 --> 01:08:25,370
recommendations.
Great quote.

1507
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:27,500
Apparently.
Apparently he wasn't even acting.

1508
01:08:27,590 --> 01:08:31,890
It was just kind of just letting people 
know what's at a good.

1509
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:36,960
Then there's no meaning of life.
Your meaning of life is different than 

1510
01:08:37,551 --> 01:08:39,980
Jamie's mine.
Mine's different than yours.

1511
01:08:39,981 --> 01:08:43,880
It's like we overall different.
You would if you were a guy who,

1512
01:08:43,881 --> 01:08:45,830
uh,
really wanted to fix shoes,

1513
01:08:46,190 --> 01:08:48,440
you know,
and you were forced to make podcasts all

1514
01:08:48,441 --> 01:08:49,640
the time.
He'd be bummed out,

1515
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:50,990
like,
fuck podcasts.

1516
01:08:50,991 --> 01:08:54,020
I like fixing shoes.
That'd be some really bad podcasts.

1517
01:08:54,230 --> 01:08:57,230
And if you were in that shoe fixer place
that I told you about,

1518
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:58,820
he'd be bummed out.
But like,

1519
01:08:58,821 --> 01:09:00,980
this is bullshit.
I want to talk about bitcoin.

1520
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:03,080
He'd be like,
do people know about bitcoin?

1521
01:09:03,290 --> 01:09:08,000
I accept shoe payments going in anyway 
possible.

1522
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,590
I'll accept bitcoin.
I mean,

1523
01:09:09,591 --> 01:09:10,270
we all,
all,

1524
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:15,400
everybody's life is different.
There's some people's lives that they 

1525
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:15,400
love that you would want to fucking kill
yourself.

1526
01:09:15,620 --> 01:09:20,620
Like if you,
if you had to live as a fucking fur 

1527
01:09:20,620 --> 01:09:20,780
trapper in the middle of Canada,
you'd kill yourself and be like,

1528
01:09:20,781 --> 01:09:23,500
I can't do this.
I'm taking a jet ski to Work Everyday or

1529
01:09:23,570 --> 01:09:25,550
Wales Snow Skis.
Actually,

1530
01:09:25,551 --> 01:09:30,551
my level,
the level of enjoyment would totally 

1531
01:09:30,551 --> 01:09:30,551
depend on if there is a medical 
marijuana because if there was,

1532
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:35,560
I would love the winter there.
Would you be high as fuck in a log 

1533
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:35,560
cabin?
Yes.

1534
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:35,600
I would be panicking though.
You'd be like,

1535
01:09:35,601 --> 01:09:36,830
dude,
I'm going to freeze to death out here.

1536
01:09:36,831 --> 01:09:41,831
I'm going to run out of what I'm going 
to have to eat the house I'm gonna have 

1537
01:09:41,831 --> 01:09:41,831
to like,
like my house on fire to heat it.

1538
01:09:43,530 --> 01:09:48,530
There's,
there's times where you're living in 

1539
01:09:48,530 --> 01:09:49,460
those places where you have to go out 
and get wood and it's 30 below zero.

1540
01:09:49,940 --> 01:09:54,940
You gotta go outside,
start chopping down wood because if you 

1541
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:54,940
don't,
you're not going to make it.

1542
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:55,520
Yeah.
I don't like those kinds of situations.

1543
01:09:55,690 --> 01:09:56,340
Wherever,
anything,

1544
01:09:56,370 --> 01:09:58,970
anything that ends in your role,
you're not going to make it.

1545
01:09:59,090 --> 01:10:01,250
Yeah.
That's where I draw the line.

1546
01:10:01,730 --> 01:10:06,730
Especially if you're like kind of cold 
here in bed already or already cold,

1547
01:10:07,041 --> 01:10:12,041
you're wrapped up and you're freezing 
and you're looking over at the log pie 

1548
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:12,041
like,
oh my God,

1549
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:12,890
I'm not going to get through the night.
I'm going to have to go outside.

1550
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:15,320
Shit.
Then you realize like,

1551
01:10:15,321 --> 01:10:17,090
okay,
how far is the closest trees?

1552
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:20,360
Let's do this.
Let's do this.

1553
01:10:20,390 --> 01:10:25,390
Let's do this.
Shut the door and it opens because the 

1554
01:10:25,390 --> 01:10:28,361
wind is blowing so strong.
You have to shut it again and pull it 

1555
01:10:28,361 --> 01:10:31,061
tight.
Pole at shots and you're out there with 

1556
01:10:31,061 --> 01:10:33,431
a fucking hack saw with snowshoes on the
wind's blowing sideways.

1557
01:10:36,170 --> 01:10:39,650
Your fucking freezing and you think to 
yourself,

1558
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:44,680
I don't know how much longer I could 
stay out here and it sounds like the 

1559
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:47,381
worst airbnb vacation.
Somebody didn't read the full 

1560
01:10:47,381 --> 01:10:47,810
description.
Negative 30 degrees.

1561
01:10:47,811 --> 01:10:49,540
Fucking wolves everywhere.
Well,

1562
01:10:49,541 --> 01:10:51,080
that's the real scary thing,
man.

1563
01:10:51,081 --> 01:10:52,850
Not global warming.
Global warming,

1564
01:10:52,851 --> 01:10:54,350
scary.
The oceans rise.

1565
01:10:54,380 --> 01:10:55,760
Oh my God,
we lost Malibu.

1566
01:10:56,150 --> 01:10:57,530
Yeah,
that's scary.

1567
01:10:57,830 --> 01:11:00,080
But what's really scaring global 
cooling.

1568
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:04,070
That's the really scary shit.
Go back into an ice age.

1569
01:11:04,180 --> 01:11:06,530
Oh God,
that was then.

1570
01:11:06,770 --> 01:11:09,110
Then your bitcoins won't save you,
unfortunately.

1571
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:11,930
Have you seen cave of forgotten dreams?
The Werner Herzog film?

1572
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,920
I have not.
I watched it again the other night.

1573
01:11:14,330 --> 01:11:16,620
Um,
it's really amazing.

1574
01:11:17,130 --> 01:11:18,090
It's about this

1575
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:21,590
cave in France.
I would say France,

1576
01:11:21,591 --> 01:11:24,200
but I'm fucking American.
So I say it my way.

1577
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:25,430
This,
this cave,

1578
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:28,280
it was,
they found these really,

1579
01:11:28,281 --> 01:11:33,281
really old cave paintings that were like
twice as old as the oldest cave 

1580
01:11:33,681 --> 01:11:36,050
paintings that had ever been found.
There were like 40,000

1581
01:11:36,051 --> 01:11:41,051
plus years old and there's all these 
animals like animal bones in the cave,

1582
01:11:42,250 --> 01:11:47,250
like,
like bears that don't even exist 

1583
01:11:47,250 --> 01:11:47,250
anymore.
Like,

1584
01:11:47,250 --> 01:11:50,090
like this crazy cave bear thing and this
guy,

1585
01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:55,380
Werner Herzog as the narrator and he's 
going over all the artwork and all the 

1586
01:11:55,380 --> 01:12:00,070
different things and you just think 
about what it must have been like to 

1587
01:12:00,070 --> 01:12:02,000
live in this era and be like these 
people and you realize,

1588
01:12:02,001 --> 01:12:03,020
oh my God,
these people.

1589
01:12:03,021 --> 01:12:06,710
This was before the fucking ice age.
This was like 40,000

1590
01:12:06,711 --> 01:12:09,650
years ago.
This is before the ice age ended,

1591
01:12:09,651 --> 01:12:11,540
like 10,000
years ago.

1592
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:15,410
So this was like full on different 
world.

1593
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:17,870
This was back when North America was 
covered in ice.

1594
01:12:17,871 --> 01:12:20,600
This is back when the continents were 
connected and you could

1595
01:12:20,710 --> 01:12:25,690
walk from Russia to Alaska.
It was all frozen ground.

1596
01:12:26,140 --> 01:12:28,360
I must have been a weird time.
Fuck,

1597
01:12:28,550 --> 01:12:32,520
are you kidding me?
Do people walked here from Russia also?

1598
01:12:32,521 --> 01:12:34,510
Not a lot of generational progress.
You know,

1599
01:12:34,511 --> 01:12:39,511
you get the whole generations where your
life is pretty much the same as your 

1600
01:12:39,511 --> 01:12:40,970
parents and their parents.
That's a good point now.

1601
01:12:41,010 --> 01:12:44,020
Like there's a decent chance that if I 
have kids someday,

1602
01:12:44,620 --> 01:12:47,290
my kids will be on a spaceship at some 
point in their lives.

1603
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:50,410
Very possibly the,
we don't fuck it up.

1604
01:12:51,070 --> 01:12:52,120
I don't think we will.
I think,

1605
01:12:52,121 --> 01:12:54,100
uh,
I think we're on a decent path now.

1606
01:12:54,130 --> 01:12:57,010
I was really concerned for a few years 
because it was kinda creepy.

1607
01:12:57,011 --> 01:13:00,070
All the surveillance stuff and you're 
not concerned anymore.

1608
01:13:00,790 --> 01:13:02,320
I mean,
I'm still concerned about those things,

1609
01:13:02,321 --> 01:13:04,870
but I think that now the math is kind of
set in our favor.

1610
01:13:04,970 --> 01:13:05,420
You know,
when,

1611
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:08,110
whenever something starts to take off,
it just,

1612
01:13:08,140 --> 01:13:09,100
it happens.
You know,

1613
01:13:09,250 --> 01:13:14,250
this is surveillance stuff.
The real issue is going to be for them 

1614
01:13:14,250 --> 01:13:17,260
that as technology becomes more and more
pervasive,

1615
01:13:18,130 --> 01:13:18,610
it's

1616
01:13:19,130 --> 01:13:24,130
it's going to connect everybody to it so
it's not going to be possible to shield 

1617
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:29,090
themselves from the impact of that and 
it's all in a lot of ways.

1618
01:13:29,091 --> 01:13:32,360
It's like the Internet itself,
like when they made the Internet,

1619
01:13:32,750 --> 01:13:35,870
they didn't really foresee what the 
potential uses of it.

1620
01:13:35,930 --> 01:13:40,930
We're going to be.
They use that as a method where they 

1621
01:13:40,930 --> 01:13:45,071
could send information.
There was a a network that they could 

1622
01:13:45,071 --> 01:13:47,620
connect and send files back and forth to
different computers.

1623
01:13:47,630 --> 01:13:49,730
I mean that was essentially the original
idea behind it,

1624
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:55,240
but along the way they unintentionally 
engineered the greatest revolution of 

1625
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:57,140
thought that the human race has ever 
seen.

1626
01:13:57,200 --> 01:14:02,200
By far in my lifetime.
I've seen radical changes in the way 

1627
01:14:02,271 --> 01:14:06,800
people view ideas,
establish truths,

1628
01:14:07,130 --> 01:14:10,310
find out information on their phone 
within seconds,

1629
01:14:10,311 --> 01:14:15,311
get access.
It's essentially the database of the 

1630
01:14:15,311 --> 01:14:15,311
human race.
I mean this is.

1631
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:20,400
This is a big crazy fucking change and 
it happened in our lifetime and it 

1632
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:24,931
happened really quickly and it happened 
because nobody saw it comment and I 

1633
01:14:24,931 --> 01:14:28,711
think that what they're doing 
inadvertently by spying on people,

1634
01:14:29,081 --> 01:14:33,010
by checking everybody's emails and by 
checking everybody's text messages,

1635
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:38,260
there are inadvertently creating 
technology that they thought would 

1636
01:14:38,260 --> 01:14:41,251
empower them.
They thought this top technology is 

1637
01:14:41,251 --> 01:14:41,560
going to allow us to keep an eye on all 
these.

1638
01:14:41,561 --> 01:14:46,561
No good troublemakers out there,
but what they didn't consider is it's 

1639
01:14:46,561 --> 01:14:49,550
eventually going to grow and expand to 
the point where keeps an eye on youtube.

1640
01:14:49,620 --> 01:14:51,230
Bitch.
You too.

1641
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:52,330
It's going to know you're here,
blah,

1642
01:14:52,331 --> 01:14:52,570
blah,
blah,

1643
01:14:52,571 --> 01:14:52,990
blah.
Made me,

1644
01:14:52,991 --> 01:14:54,910
but we need a firewall.
There's no such thing.

1645
01:14:54,970 --> 01:14:56,890
It's not this thing.
We've gotten nano.

1646
01:14:56,891 --> 01:14:58,270
There's no firewalls anymore,
man.

1647
01:14:58,540 --> 01:15:03,540
Everybody has access to everything else,
so this is what it is and now everybody 

1648
01:15:03,540 --> 01:15:07,420
knows you're a pedophile and now 
everybody knows you're a fucking creep.

1649
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:08,930
Now everybody knows.
You know,

1650
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:13,960
the only reason why you got your job is 
because you bribed such and such and 

1651
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:17,821
paid off this and that and you have this
really unethical deal with this company 

1652
01:15:17,821 --> 01:15:21,550
to does this to the land and now you're 
going to be responsible because you knew

1653
01:15:21,551 --> 01:15:26,551
that they were poisoning those rivers 
and here's all these children that were 

1654
01:15:26,551 --> 01:15:29,461
born with birth defects that lived down 
river from this in these small villages 

1655
01:15:29,461 --> 01:15:33,270
because they didn't have a say because 
they didn't have any political 

1656
01:15:33,270 --> 01:15:33,940
representation and no one had to say at 
the fucking meeting when you said it was

1657
01:15:33,941 --> 01:15:36,250
okay to dump toxic slime into the 
fucking river.

1658
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:41,640
All that's gonna happen is you're going 
to be accountable for all crimes against

1659
01:15:42,551 --> 01:15:47,551
humanity.
Anybody who's doing anything that the 

1660
01:15:47,551 --> 01:15:48,820
American public looks at the world view 
looks at and says,

1661
01:15:48,821 --> 01:15:53,821
Hey,
you motherfuckers are profiting off of 

1662
01:15:53,821 --> 01:15:56,460
suffering.
Whether it's doctors that got paid off 

1663
01:15:56,460 --> 01:15:59,260
money to create laws or to help 
establish laws,

1664
01:15:59,261 --> 01:16:04,261
to advise on laws that make no sense.
That eventually wound up getting more 

1665
01:16:04,261 --> 01:16:06,550
people locked up for drug offenses.
There's doctors that have been paid off.

1666
01:16:06,551 --> 01:16:11,551
By that I mean that was the big thing 
before Sanjay Gupta when I mean kinda 

1667
01:16:11,590 --> 01:16:15,100
like completely flipped the switch and 
went pro medical marijuana,

1668
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:18,000
pro human being and throw humor,
CNN.

1669
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:20,520
Well he was being paid off by 
pharmaceutical companies.

1670
01:16:20,521 --> 01:16:22,800
That was like one of the big things.
It was found out about him.

1671
01:16:22,980 --> 01:16:24,180
Dr Drew,
same thing.

1672
01:16:24,210 --> 01:16:24,440
They get

1673
01:16:24,540 --> 01:16:26,370
paid,
they get paid to be consultants.

1674
01:16:26,371 --> 01:16:27,760
They get paid to give advice.
You know,

1675
01:16:27,780 --> 01:16:32,780
it's so disgusting in 2014 that the 
state of Florida only lost the medical 

1676
01:16:33,181 --> 01:16:36,690
marijuana thing by a few percentage 
points to add to get to 60 percent.

1677
01:16:36,691 --> 01:16:38,770
And I think the guy around 57,
57,

1678
01:16:38,771 --> 01:16:40,180
56,
I think it was six,

1679
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:46,080
something like that,
is that because there's so many people 

1680
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:46,350
in pain in the state of Florida and they
have to go on shit like Oxycontin,

1681
01:16:46,351 --> 01:16:48,960
which is dangerous and your shit your 
liver out.

1682
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:52,740
We'd since the time of Jesus,
not a single overdose and they're not,

1683
01:16:52,830 --> 01:16:54,690
they're not giving people access to it.
It's just so.

1684
01:16:55,740 --> 01:16:57,690
It's so in your face corrupt and you're 
like,

1685
01:16:57,691 --> 01:16:59,070
well,
what is the other reason for it?

1686
01:16:59,071 --> 01:17:00,120
And there is not a reason.

1687
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:03,640
It's not corrupt though.
It's just they didn't make it.

1688
01:17:03,670 --> 01:17:06,850
They didn't do a good job and they 
didn't get to the 60 percent.

1689
01:17:06,851 --> 01:17:10,100
They needed to change the constitution.
That's what it is to get past

1690
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:12,950
as far as like public,
like what you like 50 percent.

1691
01:17:12,951 --> 01:17:16,460
But there is anti anti legalization 
money spent.

1692
01:17:16,490 --> 01:17:20,210
Of course there's always going to be in 
get ready old people,

1693
01:17:20,390 --> 01:17:23,840
old people are dumb as fuck and the 
floors infested with them and they still

1694
01:17:23,841 --> 01:17:28,841
believe that marijuana is make your 
fucking feet fall off and you hear your 

1695
01:17:28,841 --> 01:17:31,550
ears go numb and you're fucking one.
I'm just going to make the jazz too loud

1696
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:34,840
and to make the jazz too loud and they 
have that white penis is shrink.

1697
01:17:34,841 --> 01:17:38,000
A black penises actually get larger.
They don't know.

1698
01:17:38,060 --> 01:17:41,930
You know,
they think marijuana's a about chocolate

1699
01:17:41,970 --> 01:17:44,810
study to gives your brain damage.
You know,

1700
01:17:44,811 --> 01:17:49,811
there's always a study that they can 
somehow or another recall they might've 

1701
01:17:49,811 --> 01:17:50,330
saw on the back page of us weekly,
you know,

1702
01:17:50,331 --> 01:17:51,830
who the fuck knows?
It's hard.

1703
01:17:51,860 --> 01:17:56,860
It's hard getting a bunch of people on 
board with especially something that 

1704
01:17:56,860 --> 01:17:56,860
they don't have anything to do with.

1705
01:17:56,860 --> 01:17:59,040
If they're all golfing,
I don't want these goddamn kids.

1706
01:17:59,260 --> 01:18:02,330
Their pot trying to get my golfing in my
golf game's picked up.

1707
01:18:02,331 --> 01:18:07,331
David Chapman.
I didn't want to fucking pot heads out 

1708
01:18:07,331 --> 01:18:07,760
here and ruin in golf.
For me that is.

1709
01:18:07,790 --> 01:18:09,620
That is the counterpoint,
but they were,

1710
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:11,330
you know,
they were close to 60 percent,

1711
01:18:11,331 --> 01:18:13,280
which is what they needed to change the 
constitution,

1712
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:14,990
the state constitution.
Sure.

1713
01:18:14,991 --> 01:18:19,991
They'll get it next time around.
They should know they should finish 

1714
01:18:19,991 --> 01:18:19,991
points,
four percentage points.

1715
01:18:19,991 --> 01:18:24,330
It would be really dumb for them 
financially to ignore the fact that the 

1716
01:18:24,330 --> 01:18:25,520
money's being spent no matter what you 
do,

1717
01:18:25,550 --> 01:18:30,550
it's just being spent in going into the 
hand of drug dealers or I'm paying 

1718
01:18:30,550 --> 01:18:30,550
taxes.
It's a stupid strategy,

1719
01:18:30,770 --> 01:18:35,770
right?
Like you're denying people access to 

1720
01:18:35,770 --> 01:18:35,770
money,
but the people that are doing it,

1721
01:18:35,770 --> 01:18:36,180
they're,
they're,

1722
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:37,670
they're cannibals.
I mean,

1723
01:18:38,090 --> 01:18:43,090
these people that are the pharmaceutical
companies that are so concerned with 

1724
01:18:43,090 --> 01:18:43,940
this marijuana coming in and fucking 
everything up,

1725
01:18:43,941 --> 01:18:47,720
they're spending millions and millions 
of dollars to demonize it and they.

1726
01:18:48,050 --> 01:18:52,010
They've donated shitloads of money to a 
partnership for a drug free America.

1727
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:57,280
Like all of that is just just a strategy
to make whatever they're selling have a 

1728
01:18:57,861 --> 01:19:00,110
longer shelf life.
If they can keep selling it for two,

1729
01:19:00,111 --> 01:19:01,310
three,
four more years,

1730
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:06,520
whatever it is,
whatever money grabbed they're on right 

1731
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:06,520
now.
You know,

1732
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:09,701
our studies show we can,
we can keep our finger in this dike for 

1733
01:19:09,701 --> 01:19:13,391
up to 16 more months.
I mean we have 80 percent old people and

1734
01:19:13,551 --> 01:19:16,490
none of them are online and they're not 
googling shit,

1735
01:19:16,491 --> 01:19:20,900
so let's just tell them that marijuana 
makes black people go crazy.

1736
01:19:20,970 --> 01:19:23,920
It makes them go crazy and start dancing
on white people's cars.

1737
01:19:24,140 --> 01:19:29,140
Isn't that weird to learn that?
That is actually the basis for drug 

1738
01:19:29,140 --> 01:19:32,141
policy was a racist,
racist doctor in Louisiana in the 19 

1739
01:19:32,141 --> 01:19:33,950
thirties and then Nixon being insane.
Well,

1740
01:19:33,951 --> 01:19:36,290
it wasn't even Nixon.
It was way before Nixon.

1741
01:19:36,291 --> 01:19:41,291
Of course it was.
The whole idea was if you believe the 

1742
01:19:41,291 --> 01:19:45,620
story was all engineered by William 
Randolph hearst or to sell more,

1743
01:19:45,770 --> 01:19:50,030
he wanted to make sure that he gets cell
paper that was made from trees.

1744
01:19:51,410 --> 01:19:56,410
We had paper he had.
He not only did he own a newspaper 

1745
01:19:58,130 --> 01:19:59,030
companies,
you know,

1746
01:19:59,450 --> 01:20:00,050
whatever,
uh,

1747
01:20:00,110 --> 01:20:04,010
newspapers,
but he also owned these processing mills

1748
01:20:04,430 --> 01:20:08,040
and these giant chunks of land that were
filled with and he would chop the trees

1749
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:08,970
down and turn them in.
Well,

1750
01:20:08,971 --> 01:20:11,610
he was going to have to convert 
everything to hemp.

1751
01:20:11,910 --> 01:20:16,910
Hemp was going to be the new paper.
It's way better paper and amazing to 

1752
01:20:16,910 --> 01:20:20,430
this day that the paper we use on a 
daily basis is made out of trees because

1753
01:20:20,431 --> 01:20:25,431
it's the stupidest way to make paper.
It takes way too long to generate like 

1754
01:20:25,431 --> 01:20:29,370
acres of trees that are viable that you 
can chop down and turned into paper with

1755
01:20:29,410 --> 01:20:33,090
the marijuana every fucking year.
You've got a new giant crop.

1756
01:20:33,450 --> 01:20:35,760
He chopped that shit down.
Your replanted.

1757
01:20:35,761 --> 01:20:38,040
It grows like a weed because it is a 
fucking weed.

1758
01:20:38,430 --> 01:20:40,570
It gets huge really quick.
It,

1759
01:20:40,650 --> 01:20:42,990
it's fucking ridiculous how fast pot 
grows.

1760
01:20:43,110 --> 01:20:46,800
And the paper far superior,
like the fibers way stronger.

1761
01:20:47,070 --> 01:20:48,720
It's light,
it's strong.

1762
01:20:48,990 --> 01:20:50,970
You can make houses with it,
you know,

1763
01:20:50,971 --> 01:20:54,540
it's like they make particle board,
it's like the shitty type of plywood and

1764
01:20:54,541 --> 01:20:57,570
they make it with like little chips of 
wood from a lumber yard and they glue it

1765
01:20:57,571 --> 01:21:01,350
all together and press it.
That when they make that shit with him,

1766
01:21:01,380 --> 01:21:03,780
it's way stronger,
way lighter.

1767
01:21:03,830 --> 01:21:08,830
It's good for clothing too.
There's a company in Santa Monica that 

1768
01:21:08,830 --> 01:21:11,831
makes polo shirts and they just.
They wick much better than a cotton polo

1769
01:21:11,991 --> 01:21:16,991
shirt.
You don't feel as sweaty and gross by 

1770
01:21:16,991 --> 01:21:16,991
the end of the day.

1771
01:21:16,991 --> 01:21:19,830
It's amazing.
It's almost ridiculous how many uses 

1772
01:21:19,830 --> 01:21:23,040
hemp and marijuana have.
It's almost ridiculous when you look at 

1773
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:24,280
the fact that it's actually an illegal 
plant in most of the country.

1774
01:21:24,281 --> 01:21:26,320
Even hemp,
the non psychoactive version of it,

1775
01:21:26,620 --> 01:21:30,340
that it's illegal in most of the country
in 2014.

1776
01:21:30,341 --> 01:21:30,700
It just.

1777
01:21:30,980 --> 01:21:35,980
This goes back to the status thing.
It's like people aren't some kind of 

1778
01:21:35,980 --> 01:21:37,850
trance like I definitely like I see the 
need for laws and roads and everything,

1779
01:21:38,390 --> 01:21:43,390
but just because something is illegal 
that you put something on a sheet that 

1780
01:21:43,390 --> 01:21:45,440
says controlled substances.
It's completely arbitrary.

1781
01:21:45,890 --> 01:21:50,890
Nobody outside of the United States even
recognizes that and historically 

1782
01:21:50,890 --> 01:21:52,160
speaking,
people have been around for thousands of

1783
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:57,160
years and using this plant.
So where does that arrogance seep in 

1784
01:21:57,160 --> 01:22:01,110
that you can just put something on a 
sheet of paper and suddenly like 

1785
01:22:01,110 --> 01:22:01,980
everybody's lifestyle has to change or 
if they don't you can put them in.

1786
01:22:02,510 --> 01:22:04,240
It goes back to what we were talking 
about before.

1787
01:22:04,450 --> 01:22:09,450
So this all happened because you,
you had like a disconnect between people

1788
01:22:10,361 --> 01:22:12,420
and the distribution of information.
You know,

1789
01:22:12,430 --> 01:22:17,430
if you,
if you stood on top of our platform and 

1790
01:22:17,430 --> 01:22:19,861
said,
here you hear Yeahi find people of the 

1791
01:22:19,861 --> 01:22:21,931
town,
the king has come forth with the new 

1792
01:22:21,931 --> 01:22:21,931
law,
the new law,

1793
01:22:21,931 --> 01:22:23,320
the states,
and you say that,

1794
01:22:23,321 --> 01:22:25,270
and then the people are left in this 
helpless state.

1795
01:22:25,271 --> 01:22:26,560
Like fuck,
this is the law.

1796
01:22:26,580 --> 01:22:28,660
While again,
this is the law now and you don't,

1797
01:22:28,900 --> 01:22:33,900
you don't get a line of communication 
and you get this weird sense of 

1798
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:33,900
separation like,
well,

1799
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:35,380
oh,
that person is different.

1800
01:22:35,381 --> 01:22:37,110
He's the king,
and he passes like,

1801
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:38,380
no,
he's a fucking person.

1802
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:43,500
They're all just people and that is 
what's being exposed was being exposed 

1803
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:45,700
as there is no special.
There's just people.

1804
01:22:45,730 --> 01:22:50,730
Just because you're the president 
doesn't mean you get to lock people up 

1805
01:22:50,730 --> 01:22:52,210
because they want to smoke pot.
Just because you're a judge doesn't mean

1806
01:22:52,211 --> 01:22:54,640
if I say fuck you to you,
it's different than you saying,

1807
01:22:54,641 --> 01:22:55,870
fuck you.
To me it's the same.

1808
01:22:55,890 --> 01:22:57,650
We're just people.
If you say fuck you,

1809
01:22:57,660 --> 01:23:00,460
you shouldn't say fuck you.
That's really kind of mean,

1810
01:23:00,730 --> 01:23:03,400
but it's also a mean to say go to hell.
It's,

1811
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:05,020
you know,
it's mean to say you.

1812
01:23:06,390 --> 01:23:08,530
It's,
it's mean to say mean things.

1813
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:11,170
Everybody knows what the fuck got it.
That entails.

1814
01:23:11,590 --> 01:23:16,540
So this idea that they're more important
or they're more valuable or their,

1815
01:23:16,570 --> 01:23:17,300
you know,
their,

1816
01:23:17,610 --> 01:23:22,510
their state of mind is to be looked at 
with higher regard than yours.

1817
01:23:22,690 --> 01:23:24,790
They're to be treated with reverence,
all rise.

1818
01:23:24,970 --> 01:23:29,970
The honorable David Seaman has entered 
the room and you walk in with your 

1819
01:23:29,970 --> 01:23:32,550
fucking goofy 15 hundreds outfit on you,
the bib on,

1820
01:23:32,830 --> 01:23:35,710
please be seated and everybody sits down
after you do,

1821
01:23:35,711 --> 01:23:38,560
of course you sit first,
you're in charge.

1822
01:23:38,950 --> 01:23:41,480
It's fucking ridiculous and gavel and 
that,

1823
01:23:41,481 --> 01:23:44,920
that,
that kind of thinking is very similar to

1824
01:23:44,921 --> 01:23:49,921
censorship in a way that it's 
disempowering and it's frustrating and 

1825
01:23:49,921 --> 01:23:50,350
it's confusing.
It doesn't make sense.

1826
01:23:50,351 --> 01:23:53,620
It doesn't ring true and it's,
it's essentially,

1827
01:23:53,650 --> 01:23:58,650
it's capitalizing on this leftover Alpha
male primate behavior system that we 

1828
01:23:59,981 --> 01:24:03,070
have stuck in our heads from when we're 
just trying to survive.

1829
01:24:03,071 --> 01:24:08,071
We're just trying to get away from 
predators and get to the highest 

1830
01:24:08,071 --> 01:24:09,730
branches and figure out where the cats 
couldn't get to us.

1831
01:24:10,030 --> 01:24:12,210
You know,
and so the people that lived the longest

1832
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:17,400
were the strongest.
Those are the ones you wanted to follow 

1833
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:17,400
up because they're still alive.
Follow them and you'll make it.

1834
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:17,880
If you don't follow them,
you're probably not gonna.

1835
01:24:17,900 --> 01:24:18,760
Make It.
That's the leader.

1836
01:24:18,761 --> 01:24:20,440
Follow the leader.
We've got to get out of here.

1837
01:24:21,100 --> 01:24:23,320
That's shit still stuck in our DNA.

1838
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:28,320
It's still a groove that's been dug into
the fucking pathways of our behavior 

1839
01:24:28,601 --> 01:24:31,660
systems and we were struggling with 
that.

1840
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:36,840
We're still struggling with that and I 
think ultimately that's one of the real 

1841
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:39,811
problems with like the idea of a group 
of people leading millions to war.

1842
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:44,470
It's one of the problems with the idea 
of a group of people dictating how money

1843
01:24:44,471 --> 01:24:49,471
gets distributed and who gets to say 
what and all of that is very similar in 

1844
01:24:49,991 --> 01:24:52,900
a way and that we really can't have it 
anymore.

1845
01:24:53,020 --> 01:24:56,710
We're too interconnected.
We can't accept it,

1846
01:24:56,770 --> 01:24:58,420
we don't.
We don't accept it.

1847
01:24:58,510 --> 01:25:03,510
It's frustrating and it causes descent 
and it's all ultimately it's unfair and 

1848
01:25:04,301 --> 01:25:09,301
it's only.
It only exists because it's always 

1849
01:25:09,301 --> 01:25:10,660
existed.
If you want it to refashion our culture.

1850
01:25:10,690 --> 01:25:13,390
Say if something happened,
the White House got hit by a meteor,

1851
01:25:13,650 --> 01:25:16,180
like the fucking penthouse got hit by 
another one.

1852
01:25:16,210 --> 01:25:18,640
This doesn't make any sense.
It's been proven.

1853
01:25:18,641 --> 01:25:22,780
It's from space,
but why would they only hit know if that

1854
01:25:22,781 --> 01:25:27,781
did happen and we have no central office
be pretty obvious that their intentions 

1855
01:25:27,781 --> 01:25:31,111
were God would be super pissed,
but we had to reengineer our society.

1856
01:25:32,650 --> 01:25:36,400
I don't think there's a fucking 
snowball's chance in hell.

1857
01:25:36,610 --> 01:25:38,380
We would go back to the presidential 
system.

1858
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:41,920
It'd be bitcoins and pre roll joints.
A localized system.

1859
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:42,760
They would be.
Yeah,

1860
01:25:42,761 --> 01:25:45,310
without a doubt.
First thing we do is legalize LSD,

1861
01:25:46,150 --> 01:25:48,850
psilocybin dmt,
all those things.

1862
01:25:48,851 --> 01:25:53,851
Legalized startup centers,
startup centers where people get your 

1863
01:25:53,851 --> 01:25:53,851
head together,
you know,

1864
01:25:53,851 --> 01:25:54,800
instead of subways there'll be like,
get,

1865
01:25:54,820 --> 01:25:59,820
get your head togethers and there'll be 
everywhere and stock staffed by 

1866
01:25:59,820 --> 01:26:02,290
professionals and people always get 
tired of me saying that like,

1867
01:26:02,440 --> 01:26:04,010
yeah,
the drugs really the answer to

1868
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:04,790
everything.
No,

1869
01:26:04,791 --> 01:26:07,370
they're not the answer to everything,
but they're the doorway to the answer to

1870
01:26:07,371 --> 01:26:09,590
everything and there is no answer to 
everything by the way,

1871
01:26:09,770 --> 01:26:10,780
but they're,
they're,

1872
01:26:10,820 --> 01:26:14,780
they're a real good indicator of whether
or not you're on the right track.

1873
01:26:14,820 --> 01:26:15,020
There

1874
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:19,130
was it like I will after I did something
over the summer and had some interesting

1875
01:26:19,131 --> 01:26:20,730
experiences.
Uh,

1876
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:25,840
one of my old friends said,
congratulations on becoming a human 

1877
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:29,021
being,
which I thought it was a little 

1878
01:26:29,021 --> 01:26:30,161
patronizing at first,
but then I was thinking about it and I 

1879
01:26:30,161 --> 01:26:30,161
was like,
yeah,

1880
01:26:30,161 --> 01:26:32,831
actually when you're an adult and you 
hit your late twenties or early 

1881
01:26:32,831 --> 01:26:36,550
thirties,
if you haven't had any kind of altered 

1882
01:26:36,550 --> 01:26:36,550
states like that,
it's just your loss,

1883
01:26:36,550 --> 01:26:37,760
you know,
it's like you can totally live your life

1884
01:26:37,790 --> 01:26:40,820
out to the fullest without any of that 
stuff,

1885
01:26:41,150 --> 01:26:46,150
but you have avoided something that was 
incredibly beautiful and different and 

1886
01:26:46,150 --> 01:26:46,460
we'll let you see things in a different 
way.

1887
01:26:46,490 --> 01:26:49,670
And everybody who has that experience,
they come back to earth,

1888
01:26:50,090 --> 01:26:52,550
so to speak as a different person.
Like if you,

1889
01:26:52,580 --> 01:26:55,190
if you look online and you search for 
Steve Jobs,

1890
01:26:55,490 --> 01:27:00,490
lsd quote,
you can see one of the top results is 

1891
01:27:00,490 --> 01:27:02,930
what he had to say about that.
You wouldn't necessarily get this unless

1892
01:27:02,931 --> 01:27:06,020
you read his biography.
He was a big advocate of psychedelics.

1893
01:27:06,021 --> 01:27:08,360
I mean Steve Jobs,
but he wasn't a regular user,

1894
01:27:08,361 --> 01:27:11,150
which I found fascinating.
We use the 10 or 15 times,

1895
01:27:11,700 --> 01:27:13,620
stopped,
stopped a long time.

1896
01:27:13,621 --> 01:27:18,621
Yeah,
I mean it wasn't like he was using it 

1897
01:27:18,621 --> 01:27:18,621
towards the end of his life.

1898
01:27:18,621 --> 01:27:18,621
Well,
it's like Alan Watts says,

1899
01:27:18,621 --> 01:27:19,100
Alan Watts said,
if you get the,

1900
01:27:19,101 --> 01:27:20,690
a,
you get the message,

1901
01:27:20,691 --> 01:27:22,970
hang up the receiver,
hang up the phone,

1902
01:27:23,180 --> 01:27:25,310
which I think is a great way of thinking
about it in some ways.

1903
01:27:25,311 --> 01:27:30,311
You know,
you've got steve jobs of whatever he 

1904
01:27:30,311 --> 01:27:30,311
needed.

1905
01:27:30,311 --> 01:27:32,380
Right.
But isn't it arrogant to think that 

1906
01:27:32,380 --> 01:27:32,380
you've already got the message?
Maybe a little.

1907
01:27:32,380 --> 01:27:36,670
Yeah.
I've never felt like any psychedelic 

1908
01:27:36,670 --> 01:27:38,930
experience.
The latest one was just a month ago or a

1909
01:27:38,930 --> 01:27:40,440
couple months ago,
right before I fell my special.

1910
01:27:40,441 --> 01:27:44,320
So I guess it was August and um,
uh,

1911
01:27:44,330 --> 01:27:47,150
I didn't feel like I got the message.
I felt like,

1912
01:27:47,151 --> 01:27:48,500
oh,
I got another message,

1913
01:27:48,900 --> 01:27:49,430
you know?
It was,

1914
01:27:49,490 --> 01:27:54,490
it was interesting.
It was definitely enlightening or 

1915
01:27:54,490 --> 01:27:57,910
illuminating.
It definitely caused me to stop and 

1916
01:27:57,910 --> 01:27:59,090
think about it every day.
I think about it all the time,

1917
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:03,530
but I would never be so cocky as to say 
I got the message.

1918
01:28:03,610 --> 01:28:08,610
Like every time I do it,
I feel like there's a new message or a 

1919
01:28:08,610 --> 01:28:12,971
new connection that I'm making or a new 
level of the game that my mind gets 

1920
01:28:14,391 --> 01:28:15,230
access to.

1921
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:16,070
Well,
here's,

1922
01:28:16,100 --> 01:28:21,100
here's what's cocky is to be somebody 
who's never touched any of these things 

1923
01:28:21,100 --> 01:28:22,070
and you go at can't possibly have value 
for other people.

1924
01:28:22,160 --> 01:28:22,760
And it's like,
well,

1925
01:28:22,761 --> 01:28:25,880
how do you know that?
Especially if you know that's a,

1926
01:28:25,881 --> 01:28:30,881
that's a trap.
Like you and I were talking before we 

1927
01:28:30,881 --> 01:28:33,581
started rolling Lisa Ling documentary,
which aired on CNN about the Iowasca 

1928
01:28:34,731 --> 01:28:36,840
ceremonies in South America.
Uh,

1929
01:28:37,070 --> 01:28:42,070
my mom had it on Dvr.
And so when I went home for 

1930
01:28:42,070 --> 01:28:42,070
Thanksgiving,
she was like,

1931
01:28:42,070 --> 01:28:42,200
Oh,
do you want to watch the documentary?

1932
01:28:42,201 --> 01:28:46,970
And I put it on and I was expecting it 
to be the typical cnn take on,

1933
01:28:47,510 --> 01:28:49,340
uh,
on psychedelics,

1934
01:28:49,341 --> 01:28:54,341
you know.
And then she started talking about this 

1935
01:28:54,341 --> 01:28:54,341
young boy who died down there.
And I was like,

1936
01:28:54,341 --> 01:28:54,341
oh,
great,

1937
01:28:54,341 --> 01:28:56,360
that's gonna be the focus of the whole 
fucking hour is this idiot.

1938
01:28:56,780 --> 01:28:59,660
But as it turned out,
it was an incredibly fair take.

1939
01:29:00,110 --> 01:29:01,740
And it followed,
uh,

1940
01:29:01,830 --> 01:29:04,230
experience of some Marines who had 
posttraumatic,

1941
01:29:04,250 --> 01:29:06,150
uh,
know ptsd really bad,

1942
01:29:06,151 --> 01:29:11,151
like to the extent that they couldn't be
around other people because they were 

1943
01:29:11,151 --> 01:29:13,671
afraid of harming those people.
And you can see the transformation take 

1944
01:29:13,671 --> 01:29:18,021
place.
They become more peaceful and more self 

1945
01:29:18,021 --> 01:29:18,021
aware.
And that's not even the whole,

1946
01:29:18,021 --> 01:29:18,360
the whole thing.
You know,

1947
01:29:18,361 --> 01:29:20,790
they're just filming a little portion of
it for the documentary.

1948
01:29:21,220 --> 01:29:26,220
Uh,
some of these guys are doing it 

1949
01:29:26,220 --> 01:29:26,220
repeatedly.
Really interesting stuff.

1950
01:29:26,220 --> 01:29:29,690
Like I don't see how a,
if you're one of those people who's 

1951
01:29:29,690 --> 01:29:32,391
like,
this should be walled off from 

1952
01:29:32,391 --> 01:29:32,391
everybody.
If there's medical benefit happening,

1953
01:29:32,391 --> 01:29:32,460
why not?

1954
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:34,500
Well,
those people that should be walled off,

1955
01:29:34,501 --> 01:29:35,490
why?
What?

1956
01:29:35,790 --> 01:29:37,380
Where's the bodies?
What's going on?

1957
01:29:38,460 --> 01:29:39,840
This one kid died.
First of all,

1958
01:29:39,841 --> 01:29:41,890
no one has any idea what their kid died 
from.

1959
01:29:41,910 --> 01:29:42,240
And don't

1960
01:29:42,520 --> 01:29:47,520
all shady towns in South America by 
herself as a little teenager asking 

1961
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:47,520
where the software is,
the Iwatch

1962
01:29:47,890 --> 01:29:52,890
like at high out of my mind that 
somebody is going to take advantage of 

1963
01:29:52,890 --> 01:29:52,890
you.
Who knows?

1964
01:29:52,890 --> 01:29:53,480
Who knows if that's what happened.
I really don't know.

1965
01:29:53,540 --> 01:29:56,320
That was the Tldr.
What happened was that now I'm just,

1966
01:29:56,420 --> 01:30:01,420
I'm making it,
but did somebody do something to 

1967
01:30:01,420 --> 01:30:01,420
somebody?
They prove it.

1968
01:30:01,420 --> 01:30:02,160
They found they found a body,
right?

1969
01:30:02,690 --> 01:30:04,700
He might've been murdered.
We really don't know,

1970
01:30:05,270 --> 01:30:10,270
and this idea that you have to do in 
South America only exists because it's 

1971
01:30:10,270 --> 01:30:14,111
illegal in America.
That's stupid you can be doing at 

1972
01:30:14,111 --> 01:30:16,751
Columbia University if they would take 
some of these things off of schedule 

1973
01:30:16,751 --> 01:30:16,751
one.
Yeah.

1974
01:30:16,751 --> 01:30:19,280
If you do DMT,
you're essentially doing the most potent

1975
01:30:19,281 --> 01:30:24,050
form of the drug and Sin Iowasca if you 
smoke it and when you do that,

1976
01:30:24,080 --> 01:30:29,080
you don't need to be anywhere.
You're seen to be somewhere where you 

1977
01:30:29,080 --> 01:30:29,080
sit down.
It doesn't matter where you are,

1978
01:30:29,080 --> 01:30:29,630
you're going somewhere else.

1979
01:30:29,900 --> 01:30:32,060
You're going to another fucking 
dimension.

1980
01:30:32,110 --> 01:30:32,690
It's,
it's,

1981
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:36,560
it's not like something like you have to
be in South America to hit that spot.

1982
01:30:36,570 --> 01:30:37,100
Like,
no,

1983
01:30:37,101 --> 01:30:39,950
it's right here.
It's like you get there in 15 seconds.

1984
01:30:40,250 --> 01:30:42,070
It's not far away at all.
It's,

1985
01:30:42,350 --> 01:30:45,740
it's the most disturbing aspect of it is
the accessibility.

1986
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:47,270
Once you,
once you smoke it,

1987
01:30:47,271 --> 01:30:49,030
the accessibility of this other 
dimensions,

1988
01:30:49,031 --> 01:30:54,031
so bizarre,
mean probably even more intense if you 

1989
01:30:54,031 --> 01:30:56,270
do it in this ancient indigenous 
environment,

1990
01:30:56,271 --> 01:31:01,271
you're in the jungle and you're freaking
out and South America and he's blowing 

1991
01:31:01,271 --> 01:31:02,510
smoke on you and you're here in fucking 
Jaguars and shit.

1992
01:31:02,720 --> 01:31:05,000
I can't wait to try that out sometime.
It's going to be interesting.

1993
01:31:05,210 --> 01:31:10,210
You can.
There's places that are doing it now in 

1994
01:31:10,210 --> 01:31:12,011
California.
There's places that are doing it in the 

1995
01:31:12,011 --> 01:31:12,011
mountains.
Well,

1996
01:31:12,011 --> 01:31:12,920
I might go to the budget and I might go 
to the budget route.

1997
01:31:12,920 --> 01:31:17,920
Then California.
Well you mean you have to worry about 

1998
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:18,010
some things happening everywhere you go.
You know,

1999
01:31:18,410 --> 01:31:23,410
especially you go someplace and you have
to trust all these people and you're 

2000
01:31:23,410 --> 01:31:25,640
getting blasted out of your mind,
but when you think about how many people

2001
01:31:25,641 --> 01:31:29,930
are doing it now and you think about how
many bad reports are coming back,

2002
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:32,780
it's fairly fairly low.
With women,

2003
01:31:32,781 --> 01:31:36,830
they have to worry more because I know 
Amber Lyon,

2004
01:31:36,890 --> 01:31:40,490
she had an issue with a guy that was 
grabbing her while she was under.

2005
01:31:40,540 --> 01:31:44,030
It was a shaman who had to flee the 
scene apparently,

2006
01:31:44,390 --> 01:31:46,460
but he had done that to other women as 
well.

2007
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:48,290
You got to,
if you're a woman,

2008
01:31:48,291 --> 01:31:53,291
you have to worry about that kind of 
shit about some creepy dude who's doing 

2009
01:31:53,291 --> 01:31:53,690
weird things to people when they're 
under.

2010
01:31:53,930 --> 01:31:55,640
Yeah,
and I guess he would have to worry about

2011
01:31:55,641 --> 01:31:57,080
that as a dude too.
You know,

2012
01:31:57,110 --> 01:31:59,480
if you got the wrong shaman,
you don't.

2013
01:31:59,490 --> 01:32:00,040
You don't want to wake

2014
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:01,530
up without a couple of organs.
You know

2015
01:32:01,610 --> 01:32:02,140
what's,
you know,

2016
01:32:02,141 --> 01:32:07,141
what it is is it's become a popular 
thing and when it's become a popular 

2017
01:32:07,141 --> 01:32:07,870
thing is going to be people that want to
capitalize on that.

2018
01:32:08,740 --> 01:32:11,740
There's so much money involved.
These IOWASCA tours,

2019
01:32:11,741 --> 01:32:13,420
people are doing them in there.
You know,

2020
01:32:13,421 --> 01:32:15,760
every person's spending thousands of 
dollars and you're getting,

2021
01:32:15,761 --> 01:32:17,700
you know,
20 people at trip and Woohoo,

2022
01:32:17,710 --> 01:32:18,880
we're fucking raking it in.

2023
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:24,200
And the CNN documentary,
they were interviewing one of the local 

2024
01:32:24,200 --> 01:32:26,120
white experts and he was saying,
don't buy this stuff at the marketplaces

2025
01:32:26,330 --> 01:32:27,500
because you just don't know what's in 
it.

2026
01:32:27,550 --> 01:32:28,230
You know,
some,

2027
01:32:28,280 --> 01:32:31,010
some person trying to make money off of 
you as a tourist.

2028
01:32:31,011 --> 01:32:32,770
That's not the authentic experience,
you know?

2029
01:32:32,850 --> 01:32:34,350
Yeah.
That definitely can happen,

2030
01:32:35,340 --> 01:32:40,340
but the idea that you have to go all the
way to South America for an experience 

2031
01:32:40,340 --> 01:32:43,110
that should be legal everywhere in the 
world is fucking stupid.

2032
01:32:43,380 --> 01:32:45,720
It's,
it's mind numbingly stupid.

2033
01:32:45,730 --> 01:32:50,730
It makes me angry.
It's so stupid that we have to go to 

2034
01:32:50,730 --> 01:32:51,960
these countries that have different laws
because on this patch of dirt,

2035
01:32:51,990 --> 01:32:56,990
they can lock you up and Iowasca is a 
weird gray area too because it's not 

2036
01:32:56,990 --> 01:32:58,410
totally illegal.
It's not legal,

2037
01:32:58,411 --> 01:33:00,600
but it's not illegal,
so you're not extracting it.

2038
01:33:00,601 --> 01:33:05,601
If you extract dmt from the same plants 
that make Iowasca and you do the 

2039
01:33:05,601 --> 01:33:07,860
powdered form of it,
which you have to smoke to get into your

2040
01:33:07,861 --> 01:33:09,840
bloodstream,
that's illegal.

2041
01:33:10,050 --> 01:33:15,050
That's schedule one drug.
See the fact that all the planets but 

2042
01:33:15,050 --> 01:33:18,160
hold on site,
but all the plants that are there that 

2043
01:33:18,160 --> 01:33:18,660
comprise Iowasca,
when you mix them together,

2044
01:33:18,661 --> 01:33:22,800
they're all legal on their own and 
combining them together.

2045
01:33:22,801 --> 01:33:27,801
They're still legal,
but the drug that you're actually 

2046
01:33:27,801 --> 01:33:31,461
drinking is illegal.
So it's a very gray area because they 

2047
01:33:31,461 --> 01:33:34,941
don't have laws on all the different 
plants are so many fucking plants and 

2048
01:33:34,941 --> 01:33:37,290
it's not exactly an extraction.
It's not like a chemical extraction,

2049
01:33:37,890 --> 01:33:39,570
you know,
it's like you're making a stew.

2050
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:46,000
Yeah.
It just strikes me as so disingenuous 

2051
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,491
how people have to sneak around like 
that and deal with the specific,

2052
01:33:49,550 --> 01:33:51,260
um,
the,

2053
01:33:51,261 --> 01:33:53,240
uh,
the nuances of the law.

2054
01:33:53,590 --> 01:33:55,760
Like it just shows you how dishonest the
government is.

2055
01:33:55,761 --> 01:34:00,761
It should be like if you're paying your 
taxes and you're not staging some kind 

2056
01:34:00,761 --> 01:34:03,380
of insurrection at a walmart and you're 
not a threat to anybody,

2057
01:34:03,650 --> 01:34:08,650
you should be left the fuck alone.
And that should include like you should 

2058
01:34:08,650 --> 01:34:09,620
have access to certain mind expensing,
mind expanding substances.

2059
01:34:09,970 --> 01:34:14,970
You will,
you will more now than ever before and 

2060
01:34:14,970 --> 01:34:16,870
more five years from now than now.
It's on the way.

2061
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:18,850
There's no way you could stop it at this
point in time.

2062
01:34:19,300 --> 01:34:22,120
Too many people are talking about the 
positive benefits of it.

2063
01:34:22,121 --> 01:34:27,121
They're doing stories on CNN about it 
and much like marijuana has become 

2064
01:34:27,121 --> 01:34:31,770
accepted slowly but surely across the 
country where I don't care if they do 

2065
01:34:31,770 --> 01:34:31,770
it,
just keep it away from me.

2066
01:34:31,770 --> 01:34:33,220
There's a lot of that going on.
There's a lot of.

2067
01:34:33,221 --> 01:34:35,200
Well the let those fucking dopers have 
it,

2068
01:34:35,201 --> 01:34:37,240
but this way get tax money from it.

2069
01:34:37,430 --> 01:34:38,820
I feel about almost everything.
Like,

2070
01:34:38,970 --> 01:34:39,720
yeah,
let them do it.

2071
01:34:39,721 --> 01:34:44,721
Just keep it away from me.
Like why isn't that the approach to 

2072
01:34:44,721 --> 01:34:44,721
almost anything that's not harmful?

2073
01:34:44,721 --> 01:34:44,721
Well,
it should be.

2074
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:47,010
It's just like it should be legal to 
tattoo your face.

2075
01:34:47,030 --> 01:34:52,030
You know,
if you really want to put stars over 

2076
01:34:52,030 --> 01:34:52,030
your forehead,
fuck is supposed to stop you do whatever

2077
01:34:52,030 --> 01:34:52,590
you want.
I don't advise it,

2078
01:34:53,040 --> 01:34:56,340
but you know when you're talking about 
things like marijuana or psychedelics,

2079
01:34:56,370 --> 01:34:59,690
Lsd,
there's long history of people that have

2080
01:34:59,691 --> 01:35:02,600
stories of the positive benefits of 
these experiences,

2081
01:35:02,601 --> 01:35:07,010
so deny those from people and to deny it
without any personal experience of those

2082
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:12,400
of those drugs on your own is just 
ridiculous because you don't know what 

2083
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:13,440
you're making illegal like you,
you.

2084
01:35:13,460 --> 01:35:18,460
You're listening to what you listening 
to folk stories about a powder that 

2085
01:35:18,460 --> 01:35:19,940
steers your stole,
steals your soul,

2086
01:35:20,350 --> 01:35:21,220
like what do you what?
What?

2087
01:35:21,230 --> 01:35:24,360
What's what are you basing this on when 
you're basing it on a schedule,

2088
01:35:24,380 --> 01:35:29,380
one drug schedule,
one drug that your liver makes a 

2089
01:35:29,380 --> 01:35:31,280
schedule,
one drug that's made in your lungs,

2090
01:35:31,300 --> 01:35:36,300
a schedule,
one drug that's made by your pineal 

2091
01:35:36,300 --> 01:35:36,300
glands.

2092
01:35:36,300 --> 01:35:36,300
All little silly.
Yeah,

2093
01:35:36,300 --> 01:35:37,910
come on.
Your body's making drugs.

2094
01:35:37,940 --> 01:35:41,530
Schedule One drugs so you can get 
arrested for your body makes your body's

2095
01:35:41,560 --> 01:35:46,560
a drug dealer.
Your body's a fucking whore with intent 

2096
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:49,511
to distribute.
It's dumb and it's only allowed because 

2097
01:35:49,911 --> 01:35:54,911
it's been allowed for a long time.
If we had to start from scratch today 

2098
01:35:54,911 --> 01:35:55,790
and make an appraisal over what is 
dangerous,

2099
01:35:55,791 --> 01:36:00,791
not dangerous for society,
we'd have to have a serious 

2100
01:36:00,791 --> 01:36:02,921
consideration about prescription drugs 
and a serious consideration about 

2101
01:36:02,921 --> 01:36:03,150
alcohol.
Those are the really big ones we to.

2102
01:36:03,220 --> 01:36:08,220
We'd have to really look at the numbers 
of people that die every year from 

2103
01:36:08,220 --> 01:36:09,310
prescription drugs and they're very 
problematic there.

2104
01:36:09,320 --> 01:36:14,320
Huge.
The amount of people that get addicted 

2105
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:14,320
to prescription drugs,
very,

2106
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:17,831
very problematic.
The amount of people that just want 

2107
01:36:17,831 --> 01:36:17,831
prescription drugs,
they ask for them,

2108
01:36:17,831 --> 01:36:20,270
they complain about pains that might not
even be there.

2109
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:23,930
They exaggerate pains.
They might have psychological issues and

2110
01:36:23,931 --> 01:36:26,000
these people will legitimate physical 
ailments,

2111
01:36:26,360 --> 01:36:31,360
but there's a lot of crazy people out 
there hopped up on pain pills too and 

2112
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:31,460
they're dying.
They're dropping like flies.

2113
01:36:31,490 --> 01:36:33,590
Thousands and thousands of them every 
year.

2114
01:36:34,430 --> 01:36:39,430
You know,
we thought nine slash 11 was a big deal 

2115
01:36:39,430 --> 01:36:39,430
and you know,
nine slash 11 was awful.

2116
01:36:39,430 --> 01:36:40,010
3,000
people died.

2117
01:36:40,050 --> 01:36:45,050
It was like 100,000
people die every year from drugs and 

2118
01:36:45,050 --> 01:36:48,281
alcohol.
It's like alcohol overdoses or like 

2119
01:36:48,281 --> 01:36:48,281
something around 90,000
I think.

2120
01:36:48,281 --> 01:36:50,420
Prescription drugs.
What is the prescription drug deaths?

2121
01:36:50,570 --> 01:36:53,210
If you had to guess,
let's just get add tobacco and you go up

2122
01:36:53,211 --> 01:36:54,450
by like 400,000,
right?

2123
01:36:54,650 --> 01:36:59,650
Oh yeah.
You go up by maybe even as much as half 

2124
01:36:59,650 --> 01:36:59,650
a million just in North America alone.
Uh,

2125
01:36:59,650 --> 01:37:01,310
how many would you think prescription 
drug deaths every year.

2126
01:37:02,270 --> 01:37:05,330
Let's guess you said $100,000.
I said $100,000

2127
01:37:05,360 --> 01:37:07,400
with alcohol.
With alcohol.

2128
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:10,130
I'm going to go with 20,000
just from prescriptions.

2129
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:12,140
Jamie,
what do you think?

2130
01:37:12,950 --> 01:37:15,710
If you had to say I was gonna say way 
more,

2131
01:37:15,711 --> 01:37:17,930
but 100,000
sound does sound like a lot.

2132
01:37:17,931 --> 01:37:20,050
So I'll go with 50 to under.
Cut It.

2133
01:37:21,230 --> 01:37:25,120
I'm saying it's probably going to be 
around $25,000.

2134
01:37:26,360 --> 01:37:27,890
Let's see.
Fact Sheet,

2135
01:37:27,891 --> 01:37:32,891
prescription drug overdose in the United
States facts sheet each day in the 

2136
01:37:35,450 --> 01:37:39,320
United States,
114 people die from drug overdoses.

2137
01:37:40,250 --> 01:37:45,250
Another 6,748
are treated in emergency and emergency 

2138
01:37:45,250 --> 01:37:45,740
departments.
That's amazing.

2139
01:37:45,980 --> 01:37:50,450
So out of 7,000,
less than 7,000,

2140
01:37:50,451 --> 01:37:53,090
6,000,
900,

2141
01:37:53,091 --> 01:37:56,130
6,000,
800 plus people

2142
01:37:56,940 --> 01:38:01,560
that overdose.
So only 114 people die everyday though.

2143
01:38:01,680 --> 01:38:02,880
Yeah.
That's pretty impressive though.

2144
01:38:02,881 --> 01:38:03,750
Good.
Good job.

2145
01:38:03,751 --> 01:38:08,751
Doctors versus marijuana.
Zero deaths per day from.

2146
01:38:09,020 --> 01:38:10,410
Yes.
Well no one's.

2147
01:38:10,440 --> 01:38:13,610
No one's arguing that,
but it's pretty high and that's,

2148
01:38:13,700 --> 01:38:18,700
that's 314 people a day.
Three hundred days.

2149
01:38:19,530 --> 01:38:23,910
When is that?
In 2000.

2150
01:38:23,911 --> 01:38:28,911
Twelve to 22,000
a drug overdose deaths were related to 

2151
01:38:31,531 --> 01:38:36,531
pharmaceuticals.
Forty 1000 drug overdose deaths over a 

2152
01:38:36,531 --> 01:38:37,620
total.
So I don't know what that means.

2153
01:38:37,890 --> 01:38:42,780
So 22,000
in 2012 were pharmaceutical drugs.

2154
01:38:43,260 --> 01:38:44,830
And then there was another,
you know,

2155
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:47,280
slightly less than 20,000.
That was something else.

2156
01:38:48,090 --> 01:38:49,200
I don't know who the fuck they were.

2157
01:38:52,200 --> 01:38:53,120
A lot of people though,
dude,

2158
01:38:53,490 --> 01:38:58,490
it is in 2011.
One point 4 million people had visited 

2159
01:39:01,321 --> 01:39:05,700
the emergency room for nonmedical use of
pharmaceuticals.

2160
01:39:08,360 --> 01:39:11,260
Wow.
So people misusing their actions,

2161
01:39:11,430 --> 01:39:13,590
they're freaked out and went to the 
emergency room nod,

2162
01:39:13,591 --> 01:39:15,650
non medicinal use.
You know,

2163
01:39:15,651 --> 01:39:18,130
they,
they borrowed somebody's pills.

2164
01:39:18,200 --> 01:39:21,390
Yeah,
we're weird man.

2165
01:39:22,110 --> 01:39:24,540
It's weird how much people need to 
change their state.

2166
01:39:24,541 --> 01:39:25,770
I mean,
even when we're talking about,

2167
01:39:25,980 --> 01:39:30,980
you know,
Iowasca being able to help people and 

2168
01:39:30,980 --> 01:39:33,501
psychedelic drugs,
being able to show people new states of 

2169
01:39:33,501 --> 01:39:36,450
consciousness and new ways of being,
it's his fucking really weird that human

2170
01:39:36,451 --> 01:39:41,451
beings need that,
that we need to alter our perception 

2171
01:39:41,451 --> 01:39:41,451
like that.
Like what,

2172
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:43,500
what,
what a weird animal.

2173
01:39:43,650 --> 01:39:48,650
Like an animal that alters its 
perception by what it puts into its 

2174
01:39:48,650 --> 01:39:49,380
body.
Like it doesn't just exist like say like

2175
01:39:49,381 --> 01:39:52,520
a cheetah or a bear or a,
uh,

2176
01:39:52,530 --> 01:39:54,060
an eagle now.

2177
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:59,240
Now we exist and we change.
We move her and we think we know how 

2178
01:39:59,240 --> 01:39:59,670
important consciousness is.
Oh yeah.

2179
01:39:59,800 --> 01:40:02,010
We were the only ones that can 
communicate.

2180
01:40:02,011 --> 01:40:05,610
Like even this conversation I can 
confidently say at least on my end would

2181
01:40:05,611 --> 01:40:07,470
not be as good without drinking less 
coffee.

2182
01:40:07,590 --> 01:40:08,290
So,
you know,

2183
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:10,410
I'm,
I'm making use of chemicals right now.

2184
01:40:10,760 --> 01:40:13,700
Yeah.
And maybe a little bit.

2185
01:40:15,650 --> 01:40:17,690
Yeah.
We love to change.

2186
01:40:17,691 --> 01:40:18,880
Our state is,
I mean,

2187
01:40:18,890 --> 01:40:23,890
a few animals do in some animals drink 
like fermented juices and monkeys get 

2188
01:40:24,141 --> 01:40:24,680
drunk.
Rent.

2189
01:40:24,740 --> 01:40:29,740
Yeah.
They'll find like berries and things 

2190
01:40:29,740 --> 01:40:31,541
that have been fermented fruits that are
fermented and they'll drink that and 

2191
01:40:31,541 --> 01:40:32,690
they'll get fucked up.
Yeah.

2192
01:40:32,720 --> 01:40:33,440
People,
uh,

2193
01:40:34,070 --> 01:40:36,140
people have this weird desire changed 
their state,

2194
01:40:36,141 --> 01:40:38,390
but the also I think,
you know,

2195
01:40:38,520 --> 01:40:40,490
we look at what that is,
Oh,

2196
01:40:40,520 --> 01:40:42,200
you're drinking booze.
Oh,

2197
01:40:42,201 --> 01:40:47,201
you're doing this.
But what you're essentially doing when 

2198
01:40:47,201 --> 01:40:49,340
you're changing your state is you're 
using technology.

2199
01:40:49,610 --> 01:40:54,460
You're using information that has been 
passed on from generation to generation

2200
01:40:54,460 --> 01:40:59,460
where people figured out techniques to 
do like a pharmacological intervention 

2201
01:41:00,791 --> 01:41:05,791
on your consciousness.
We figured out a way to combine this 

2202
01:41:05,791 --> 01:41:08,821
with that.
The way to fucking take the grapes and 

2203
01:41:08,821 --> 01:41:08,821
you smash them and then you stuff in a 
barrel.

2204
01:41:08,821 --> 01:41:09,230
You let it sit for six.
You know,

2205
01:41:09,610 --> 01:41:14,610
all this was all like concocted.
These are all like solutions to dealing 

2206
01:41:15,191 --> 01:41:20,191
with the problems of the ego,
the problems of mundane consciousness 

2207
01:41:20,191 --> 01:41:24,961
and the problems of like getting stuck 
in patterns where we knew even just 

2208
01:41:24,961 --> 01:41:26,620
getting drunk,
getting drunk.

2209
01:41:26,770 --> 01:41:31,120
Sometimes we'll reset a pattern and make
you look at things in a better way.

2210
01:41:31,121 --> 01:41:33,850
Like you could have like a bad breakup.
You go out with your friends,

2211
01:41:33,851 --> 01:41:35,140
you get drunk and you're like,
oh,

2212
01:41:35,150 --> 01:41:37,680
I'll be fine.
He crash,

2213
01:41:37,730 --> 01:41:42,730
lie in your bed.
It heads fucking spinning your beds or 

2214
01:41:42,730 --> 01:41:42,730
you wake up in the morning,
you're,

2215
01:41:42,730 --> 01:41:46,491
your head's throbbing,
but you had a bit of a change of 

2216
01:41:46,491 --> 01:41:50,641
perception like you,
you use that shamanic ritual of going 

2217
01:41:50,641 --> 01:41:55,501
out and getting hammered and doing shots
with your friends to bond and to have an

2218
01:41:55,810 --> 01:42:00,010
altered state of perception and altered 
state of how you view the world.

2219
01:42:01,250 --> 01:42:01,810
Yeah,
I,

2220
01:42:01,811 --> 01:42:04,010
uh,
I think people have that all the time.

2221
01:42:04,011 --> 01:42:06,440
Like I actually,
I liked the,

2222
01:42:06,441 --> 01:42:08,180
uh,
inception aspect of,

2223
01:42:08,540 --> 01:42:09,540
of doing,
um,

2224
01:42:10,190 --> 01:42:15,190
mind altering substances where if you 
can change the way you think about 

2225
01:42:15,190 --> 01:42:15,500
something,
it actually does.

2226
01:42:15,530 --> 01:42:20,530
This sounds a little trippy,
but it changes physical reality because 

2227
01:42:20,530 --> 01:42:21,770
then you start to act in this new way.
People pick up on it,

2228
01:42:21,771 --> 01:42:22,400
they go,
Huh,

2229
01:42:22,460 --> 01:42:27,460
this is working out for David Seaman.
Maybe I'll act in this new way and be 

2230
01:42:27,460 --> 01:42:29,390
less of this kind of person.
It just kind of becomes contagious.

2231
01:42:29,420 --> 01:42:34,420
And the example of that that I had 
recently was going through a Tsa 

2232
01:42:34,420 --> 01:42:38,111
checkpoint already extremely high just 
to see kind of how I dealt with it.

2233
01:42:38,151 --> 01:42:43,151
And first of all,
all of that kind of pressure just fades 

2234
01:42:43,151 --> 01:42:43,430
away.
So when I was like taking out my wallet,

2235
01:42:43,880 --> 01:42:46,790
I was like sorting through my cards and 
like just taking my sweet ass time,

2236
01:42:46,791 --> 01:42:51,791
you know,
like totally oblivious to the fact that 

2237
01:42:51,791 --> 01:42:51,791
there's like this machine there that's 
trying to keep you,

2238
01:42:51,890 --> 01:42:56,890
you know,
just moving forward in everything so 

2239
01:42:56,890 --> 01:42:56,890
secure and we're,
you know,

2240
01:42:56,890 --> 01:42:56,890
we're screening people out.

2241
01:42:56,930 --> 01:43:01,700
And what I noticed was that this is 
really all just one big ritual.

2242
01:43:01,790 --> 01:43:05,420
It's like the Shaman patting you on the 
head before you go into the hut,

2243
01:43:05,660 --> 01:43:08,810
you're just trying to make people not be
terrified before they enter an airport.

2244
01:43:08,900 --> 01:43:12,860
Like you're in the safe zone now.
And once I had that realization that all

2245
01:43:12,861 --> 01:43:17,861
of this is fucking theater,
that they're not really trying to 

2246
01:43:17,861 --> 01:43:20,471
oppress you,
they're just trying to do this thing 

2247
01:43:20,471 --> 01:43:20,471
very quickly to make people feel like 
they've been.

2248
01:43:20,471 --> 01:43:22,090
They've been screened.
And Yeah,

2249
01:43:22,100 --> 01:43:23,720
there's definitely that.
So it,

2250
01:43:23,870 --> 01:43:28,870
for whatever reason,
it made the animosity that I had 

2251
01:43:28,870 --> 01:43:31,300
retained go away because I saw that like
all of my anger over the inefficiencies 

2252
01:43:31,521 --> 01:43:33,320
of the surveillance state and that 
stuff,

2253
01:43:33,800 --> 01:43:38,800
these fucking people asking me to take 
off my shoes take off my shoes are just 

2254
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:41,420
workers and in fact I can have fun with 
them.

2255
01:43:41,421 --> 01:43:43,550
We can have a good time,
we can be friendly.

2256
01:43:43,551 --> 01:43:44,660
We don't have to be dicks about it.

2257
01:43:45,610 --> 01:43:47,140
Yeah,
I mean it's,

2258
01:43:47,380 --> 01:43:51,040
it's unfortunate that we think that we 
need something like that.

2259
01:43:51,720 --> 01:43:51,840
It

2260
01:43:52,030 --> 01:43:54,830
is incredibly wasteful.
It's ridiculous because all of the,

2261
01:43:54,890 --> 01:43:57,260
all of the medicine is happening behind 
the scenes.

2262
01:43:57,261 --> 01:43:59,810
It's intelligence.
They know before you enter that airport,

2263
01:44:00,050 --> 01:44:05,050
if you are a threat or not,
at least they should and take off your 

2264
01:44:05,050 --> 01:44:05,050
belt and take off your shoes.
That does not.

2265
01:44:05,050 --> 01:44:08,840
My favorite thing about going through 
the TSA is when they break character,

2266
01:44:09,320 --> 01:44:14,320
you know,
like you have like a lot of urban folk 

2267
01:44:14,320 --> 01:44:14,320
working there.
And uh,

2268
01:44:14,320 --> 01:44:16,220
there was three of them the other day 
and they were like,

2269
01:44:16,221 --> 01:44:16,910
sir,
you know,

2270
01:44:16,911 --> 01:44:17,390
put,
you know,

2271
01:44:17,391 --> 01:44:19,880
put your belt into the basket.
Make sure check your phone.

2272
01:44:20,330 --> 01:44:22,270
Do you have any keys in your pockets?
Nothing changed.

2273
01:44:22,360 --> 01:44:27,360
Okay.
Step up and you know everyone's being 

2274
01:44:27,360 --> 01:44:27,710
sir ma'am.
And then in the middle of all this,

2275
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:28,490
they,
they,

2276
01:44:28,491 --> 01:44:33,491
they break out into.
I told that motherfucker he got no that 

2277
01:44:33,491 --> 01:44:33,670
shit ain't gonna work over here.

2278
01:44:33,860 --> 01:44:38,860
That shit ain't gonna work over here and
you tell him and they're like going back

2279
01:44:39,591 --> 01:44:41,680
and forth that Sir sir,
did you take your cell phone off?

2280
01:44:41,690 --> 01:44:42,840
Please put it in.
I like.

2281
01:44:42,880 --> 01:44:45,740
So they had this brief moment where they
crack.

2282
01:44:45,770 --> 01:44:48,020
They will laugh and joking around with 
each other,

2283
01:44:48,200 --> 01:44:50,270
not just humanity but who they really 
are.

2284
01:44:50,420 --> 01:44:53,090
And then they go back to this robot 
voice and they tell him like,

2285
01:44:53,120 --> 01:44:58,120
oh,
you're just regular people that are 

2286
01:44:58,120 --> 01:44:58,120
working inside this machine and you got 
to talk machine talk,

2287
01:44:58,120 --> 01:45:00,680
you know,
please take your shoes off.

2288
01:45:00,681 --> 01:45:02,810
Put them in the baskets.
If you have a laptop,

2289
01:45:02,840 --> 01:45:05,840
take it out of its case.
Put It on a tray by itself.

2290
01:45:06,290 --> 01:45:09,530
No liquids.
That's just all part of the ceremony.

2291
01:45:09,531 --> 01:45:12,950
They're doing the ceremony for you.
Well they're just safety ceremony.

2292
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:14,420
Their workers,
man.

2293
01:45:14,480 --> 01:45:19,480
It's a shit job to a bunch of people who
don't want to be there and listening to 

2294
01:45:19,480 --> 01:45:20,720
you.
You gotTa fucking tell them what to do.

2295
01:45:21,290 --> 01:45:26,290
Check their fucking ID,
make sure they're not wearing a turban 

2296
01:45:26,290 --> 01:45:26,290
with a bomb under it.
Make make you walk through.

2297
01:45:26,290 --> 01:45:31,121
The fifth element.
Body scanner thing I think is pretty 

2298
01:45:31,121 --> 01:45:31,121
weird.
Yeah.

2299
01:45:31,121 --> 01:45:33,080
It is a some sort of a radio wave too,
right?

2300
01:45:33,081 --> 01:45:36,200
It's like millimeter wave checking you 
for things.

2301
01:45:38,750 --> 01:45:41,090
It's just sad when you see like old 
people go through it.

2302
01:45:41,380 --> 01:45:46,380
You see like some old dude with a 
terrible hunch in his back and he's 

2303
01:45:46,380 --> 01:45:48,590
going to get out of his wheelchair and 
shuffle over and stand there.

2304
01:45:48,950 --> 01:45:53,950
I watched some lady the other day do it.
I didn't think she was going to be able 

2305
01:45:53,950 --> 01:45:56,701
to get out of her wheelchair and they 
made her walk through that stupid 

2306
01:45:56,701 --> 01:45:56,840
fucking thing and hold their hands up.
It's like,

2307
01:45:56,841 --> 01:46:01,841
do you really think you're dealing with 
a terrorist here as this with this is a 

2308
01:46:01,841 --> 01:46:02,840
terrorist with osteoporosis who could 
barely walk?

2309
01:46:03,170 --> 01:46:08,170
That's a threat.
It makes me sad when I see a makes me 

2310
01:46:08,170 --> 01:46:11,501
more sad when I see kids go through it 
versus old people because they're 

2311
01:46:11,501 --> 01:46:11,930
growing up only knowing that stuff.
Yeah,

2312
01:46:11,960 --> 01:46:13,620
and the get patted down.
Chefs in the.

2313
01:46:13,960 --> 01:46:16,210
I've seen kids get patted down to.
I mean,

2314
01:46:16,211 --> 01:46:19,970
I guess the idea is you don't know who 
the fucking terrorists are,

2315
01:46:19,971 --> 01:46:23,540
but come on.
It's the numbers.

2316
01:46:23,541 --> 01:46:25,470
We're dealing with her giant.
You know the,

2317
01:46:25,530 --> 01:46:30,530
the numbers when it comes to things 
actually happening versus people 

2318
01:46:30,530 --> 01:46:30,950
actually flying.
My God,

2319
01:46:30,951 --> 01:46:33,500
there's a lot of fucking people flying.
Flying is one of the safest,

2320
01:46:33,530 --> 01:46:36,500
one of these single safest things you 
can do in a lot of ways.

2321
01:46:36,850 --> 01:46:38,820
I mean,
it still doesn't feel like it.

2322
01:46:38,920 --> 01:46:40,550
You're flying through the fucking really
doesn't.

2323
01:46:43,220 --> 01:46:48,220
Did you hear about the lady got kicked 
off of a airplane because of her 

2324
01:46:48,220 --> 01:46:50,250
emotional support pig.
I think I saw that online.

2325
01:46:50,251 --> 01:46:52,050
Yeah.
It was flaking out on the plane.

2326
01:46:52,080 --> 01:46:57,080
She has a fucking pig.
Crazy ladies flying with a pig and the 

2327
01:46:57,080 --> 01:47:01,041
pig lost his shit on the plane.
Starts squeaking and squealing and 

2328
01:47:01,041 --> 01:47:02,110
didn't want to be there.
It was the pigs first flight and so,

2329
01:47:02,111 --> 01:47:03,600
uh,
they kicked her off the plane.

2330
01:47:03,690 --> 01:47:08,690
No good.
I think if you're bringing something 

2331
01:47:08,690 --> 01:47:08,690
like that on a plane and it's 
distracting people,

2332
01:47:08,690 --> 01:47:10,530
fuck off with all this emotional support
animals,

2333
01:47:10,970 --> 01:47:15,970
it's so stupid.
There's a restaurant that I go through 

2334
01:47:15,970 --> 01:47:16,560
in this actress shows up all the time,
which was she brings a fucking dog.

2335
01:47:16,570 --> 01:47:19,380
Weather brings the dog to the restaurant
and they have to.

2336
01:47:19,770 --> 01:47:24,770
The restaurant has to accept the fact 
that this lady's dog is an emotional 

2337
01:47:24,770 --> 01:47:24,770
support.

2338
01:47:24,770 --> 01:47:25,380
Dogs,
dirty,

2339
01:47:25,381 --> 01:47:29,010
stupid animals.
I love animals and I love dogs.

2340
01:47:29,011 --> 01:47:30,390
I have two dogs.
I love them,

2341
01:47:30,990 --> 01:47:34,830
but what you're saying is that dog,
that dog is in a psychiatrist,

2342
01:47:35,220 --> 01:47:40,220
shouldn't.
You shouldn't be able to get away with 

2343
01:47:40,220 --> 01:47:40,220
that loophole.
You know,

2344
01:47:40,220 --> 01:47:43,430
the idea that you're so fucked up that 
you can't be without your dog while you 

2345
01:47:43,430 --> 01:47:45,480
eat.
It's hygiene issues that we're bypassing

2346
01:47:45,481 --> 01:47:47,820
hygiene issues for one person's 
selfishness,

2347
01:47:48,150 --> 01:47:50,340
their selfishness and their,
their emotions.

2348
01:47:50,550 --> 01:47:55,550
You know,
I don't know what your dog's been 

2349
01:47:55,550 --> 01:47:55,550
stepping in.
I don't know what.

2350
01:47:55,550 --> 01:47:58,850
What's your dogs' butts going to touch 
that maybe someone's hands going to 

2351
01:47:58,850 --> 01:48:01,971
touch.
It's going to mean there's a lot of 

2352
01:48:01,971 --> 01:48:02,100
weird shit going on when you have like 
an open asshole,

2353
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:03,750
you know,
have a dog.

2354
01:48:03,840 --> 01:48:07,020
It's sitting on the ground where people 
accidentally might drop their fork,

2355
01:48:07,140 --> 01:48:12,140
they might not know the next person 
might be there and they drop their fork 

2356
01:48:12,140 --> 01:48:13,350
right where your dogs butthole was 
resting on that fucking wood floor and a

2357
01:48:13,351 --> 01:48:14,760
little scoop add dog,
asshole,

2358
01:48:14,880 --> 01:48:15,600
stupid.

2359
01:48:15,810 --> 01:48:20,810
It's and it's selfishness.
It's indicative of a culture of people 

2360
01:48:20,810 --> 01:48:24,600
that want the rules to bend in their 
favor because I need to be with my dog.

2361
01:48:25,130 --> 01:48:27,450
Like you can't bring your dog to a 
restaurant.

2362
01:48:27,690 --> 01:48:32,690
It's like people that get upset when the
whole cigarette smoking thing and bars 

2363
01:48:32,690 --> 01:48:33,870
get past.
This is bullshit.

2364
01:48:33,930 --> 01:48:36,600
When I go to a bar,
I like going to a bar and having a drink

2365
01:48:36,690 --> 01:48:39,510
and having a fucking smoke and now I got
to go outside now.

2366
01:48:39,690 --> 01:48:40,170
Yeah.
Yeah.

2367
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:42,360
Everybody shouldn't have to smell your 
smoke.

2368
01:48:42,510 --> 01:48:44,760
You dumb ass.
They shouldn't have to breathe.

2369
01:48:44,761 --> 01:48:49,761
Is Stupid air that you've created,
like sucking on some chemical soaked 

2370
01:48:49,951 --> 01:48:52,590
leaves that poisoned everybody around 
you.

2371
01:48:52,620 --> 01:48:54,660
Yeah.
That's not cool just because everybody.

2372
01:48:54,661 --> 01:48:57,240
Let you do it for so long doesn't mean 
it's good.

2373
01:48:57,900 --> 01:49:01,590
That's a perfect example of something 
where if it didn't exist,

2374
01:49:02,340 --> 01:49:03,420
you could never invent it.

2375
01:49:03,930 --> 01:49:07,620
Like you could never invent smoking in 
bars that didn't exist already.

2376
01:49:07,710 --> 01:49:11,300
You couldn't fucking invent that.
That's not you.

2377
01:49:11,360 --> 01:49:12,210
People be like,
what?

2378
01:49:12,300 --> 01:49:13,980
Everybody else has to smoke it too.
Yeah.

2379
01:49:13,981 --> 01:49:18,981
It's a new product and it kills Ya.
So I'm planning on killing him about a 

2380
01:49:18,981 --> 01:49:20,130
half million people a year.
It's really expensive.

2381
01:49:20,310 --> 01:49:22,470
That's taxed heavily.
Smells awful.

2382
01:49:22,980 --> 01:49:27,980
Your teeth are going to turn yellow.
Your liver is going to fall out of your 

2383
01:49:27,980 --> 01:49:27,980
body.
Sorry,

2384
01:49:29,070 --> 01:49:30,540
your lungs,
they'll go black.

2385
01:49:30,690 --> 01:49:32,130
You won't be able to walk upstairs 
anymore,

2386
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:36,000
but you look like a rebel.
You'll look cool as fuck.

2387
01:49:37,740 --> 01:49:39,810
Sign me up.
It's just weird.

2388
01:49:39,811 --> 01:49:44,811
When I see kids still smoking.
I saw a 14 year old kid the other day 

2389
01:49:44,811 --> 01:49:44,811
smoking,
trying to look cool.

2390
01:49:44,811 --> 01:49:46,290
Just holding a cigarette.
I was like,

2391
01:49:46,291 --> 01:49:48,850
you fucking dummy.
How do you not know?

2392
01:49:48,970 --> 01:49:51,130
Like you've got to know,
but they don't care.

2393
01:49:51,130 --> 01:49:55,270
They just in their desire to look cool 
and their desire to be upset.

2394
01:49:55,570 --> 01:49:57,370
That's like another thing about smoking 
cigarettes.

2395
01:49:57,371 --> 01:50:02,371
People love to smoke cigarettes because 
it almost justifies their shitty 

2396
01:50:02,371 --> 01:50:06,631
attitude they love to do is sit back and
look,

2397
01:50:07,331 --> 01:50:12,331
I'm willing to fucking suck on this 
cigarette and try to calm me down 

2398
01:50:12,331 --> 01:50:13,210
because we've got to get these fucking 
orders filled out.

2399
01:50:13,211 --> 01:50:15,910
You know,
like there's this idea that I'm busy,

2400
01:50:15,911 --> 01:50:17,950
I'm working,
I don't even care about my body.

2401
01:50:19,780 --> 01:50:21,580
Got I got a lot of problems,
Gaga,

2402
01:50:21,581 --> 01:50:26,581
last dress.
It's like it reinforces this ridiculous 

2403
01:50:26,581 --> 01:50:27,610
life.
It's ridiculous.

2404
01:50:27,611 --> 01:50:32,611
Life of stress,
this ridiculous life of just trying to 

2405
01:50:32,611 --> 01:50:34,690
like.
That's so much work to do that be caskey

2406
01:50:34,691 --> 01:50:39,691
anxiety.
It's just fucking life.

2407
01:50:40,420 --> 01:50:45,420
Just the insane pattern that you're 
stuck in getting up in the morning,

2408
01:50:46,930 --> 01:50:51,930
having a couple with your cup of coffee,
putting a cigarette in your mouth when 

2409
01:50:51,930 --> 01:50:53,660
you're running out the door,
light in that bitch up,

2410
01:50:53,680 --> 01:50:55,360
driving around,
throwing it out the window.

2411
01:50:55,360 --> 01:50:57,730
As you're driving down the highway,
lightened up.

2412
01:50:57,731 --> 01:51:00,820
Another one you fuckhead.
That's us.

2413
01:51:01,390 --> 01:51:06,390
People goofy as shit.
They get extra work breaks too for 

2414
01:51:06,390 --> 01:51:10,231
smoking and it becomes an issue.
What do you mean they get extra work 

2415
01:51:10,231 --> 01:51:13,831
breaks?
I shouldn't say that they get some 

2416
01:51:13,831 --> 01:51:15,961
workplaces,
they allow people to extra work breaks 

2417
01:51:15,961 --> 01:51:17,050
if you smoke because they'll become 
irritated and become really.

2418
01:51:17,051 --> 01:51:17,470
Yeah.
Oh,

2419
01:51:17,500 --> 01:51:20,320
and nonsmokers get pissed and that's 
crazy.

2420
01:51:20,321 --> 01:51:25,321
And restaurants,
it's a big thing because a lot of 

2421
01:51:25,321 --> 01:51:25,321
servers are smokers.
It's just a lifestyle for a young person

2422
01:51:25,321 --> 01:51:26,890
and becomes a huge issue in a lot of 
times.

2423
01:51:27,190 --> 01:51:29,500
Wow,
that's weird that,

2424
01:51:29,560 --> 01:51:34,560
that.
That's weird that employers would sort 

2425
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:37,921
of bend to that because if you can hold 
it in when you were flying on a flight 

2426
01:51:38,261 --> 01:51:40,840
from La to New York,
obviously you have to.

2427
01:51:41,530 --> 01:51:42,940
How come we can't hold it in while 
you're working?

2428
01:51:43,540 --> 01:51:48,540
Like obviously you can zoom in for,
you know,

2429
01:51:49,180 --> 01:51:54,180
you have to step outside and nobody else
has to carry your load while you're out 

2430
01:51:54,180 --> 01:51:55,450
there killing yourself slowly,
but you'd be the least favorite bar back

2431
01:51:55,451 --> 01:51:58,330
probably at some dive bar.
My con can imagine.

2432
01:51:58,540 --> 01:51:59,530
Well,
they probably all do it.

2433
01:51:59,770 --> 01:52:04,770
That's the thing about dive bars is 
probably a good percentage of people 

2434
01:52:04,770 --> 01:52:04,770
that are killing themselves slowly 
together.

2435
01:52:04,770 --> 01:52:06,790
So they're all team effort right there.
Yeah.

2436
01:52:06,850 --> 01:52:09,250
They used to be places that violated 
California's law.

2437
01:52:09,251 --> 01:52:14,251
When they first came out,
there was a few places that were 

2438
01:52:14,251 --> 01:52:14,320
allowing people to still smoke.
They didn't give a fuck,

2439
01:52:14,321 --> 01:52:19,321
but they just got heavy fines and they 
eventually gave up the of those smoker 

2440
01:52:19,321 --> 01:52:20,320
patio still.
Right,

2441
01:52:20,680 --> 01:52:23,680
which are just as gross know if you want
to be outside.

2442
01:52:23,860 --> 01:52:28,860
In Ohio,
they built rooms and a lot of places 

2443
01:52:28,860 --> 01:52:29,440
like a permanent tent with heaters and 
whatnot.

2444
01:52:29,720 --> 01:52:33,520
It just became an extension of their.
They don't have it now.

2445
01:52:33,920 --> 01:52:36,430
Their bar suffers.
Makes Sense,

2446
01:52:37,030 --> 01:52:42,030
but are you allowed to smoke other 
things out there like cigars or a pipe 

2447
01:52:42,030 --> 01:52:42,320
out there with a fucking show?
Lailey big,

2448
01:52:43,310 --> 01:52:46,970
big sherlock pipe.
Pontificate about the universe.

2449
01:52:47,030 --> 01:52:49,430
There's A.
There's a steakhouse in New York City.

2450
01:52:49,431 --> 01:52:50,930
Keens steakhouse.
You had been there?

2451
01:52:51,020 --> 01:52:53,450
Yes.
The largest pipe section of the walls.

2452
01:52:53,480 --> 01:52:55,580
Yeah.
What does that put those pipes under the

2453
01:52:55,581 --> 01:52:58,940
old pipes from the.
Whenever the late 18 hundreds.

2454
01:52:58,970 --> 01:53:01,340
Well don't the pipes like represent 
people that came there.

2455
01:53:01,350 --> 01:53:06,350
Then they would own their own pipe.
So when like they have a pipe that was 

2456
01:53:06,350 --> 01:53:08,690
owned by Teddy Roosevelt,
one owned by,

2457
01:53:08,691 --> 01:53:10,430
I think Mark Twain,
just always ridiculous.

2458
01:53:10,431 --> 01:53:12,500
People would come in,
they would request their pipe,

2459
01:53:12,740 --> 01:53:15,320
smoke it at dinner.
I think Einstein had a pipe there.

2460
01:53:15,590 --> 01:53:20,590
That's crazy.
See if there's any photos of people 

2461
01:53:20,590 --> 01:53:21,880
smoking their pipes at that place 
because I always wonder like that.

2462
01:53:21,890 --> 01:53:24,470
Do they smoke those pipes or those 
pipes?

2463
01:53:24,471 --> 01:53:25,690
Just like,
you know,

2464
01:53:25,700 --> 01:53:28,370
like oh I got brass hat that you like 
pinned to the wall.

2465
01:53:28,371 --> 01:53:33,371
This is David Seaman's hat.
I think back in the day those fuckers 

2466
01:53:33,371 --> 01:53:33,770
smoked them because I wonder,
look,

2467
01:53:33,980 --> 01:53:36,620
they're all in all.
It used to be men's only.

2468
01:53:36,621 --> 01:53:39,530
I was watching it on tv an old days til 
like 19.

2469
01:53:39,531 --> 01:53:40,940
Oh five or something.
It was a men's club.

2470
01:53:40,950 --> 01:53:42,800
Good old days.
Dave go there.

2471
01:53:42,950 --> 01:53:44,720
No broad,
big piece of steak.

2472
01:53:44,721 --> 01:53:49,100
Can I have a fucking meal and smoke a 
pipe the good old days.

2473
01:53:49,130 --> 01:53:50,540
But anyway,
a woman sued them,

2474
01:53:50,940 --> 01:53:54,230
some actress back in 19 something and 
then they opened it up to everybody.

2475
01:53:54,440 --> 01:53:55,220
Well,
you know,

2476
01:53:55,250 --> 01:53:58,420
didn't they do that recently with that 
curves joint?

2477
01:53:58,670 --> 01:54:02,480
The women's only gym did a guy when I 
joined curves,

2478
01:54:02,570 --> 01:54:04,550
I'm pretty sure a guy got upset and 
decided,

2479
01:54:05,020 --> 01:54:06,370
Bro,
I want to join curves.

2480
01:54:06,590 --> 01:54:09,140
I want curves.
I think my hips are too.

2481
01:54:09,150 --> 01:54:11,480
No,
I want to learn your exercises.

2482
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:15,260
I want to be a party of Jim.
Be a of curves.

2483
01:54:15,440 --> 01:54:16,280
I think,
uh,

2484
01:54:16,580 --> 01:54:21,320
it was ruled that you're going to have.
If you can't have a men's only club,

2485
01:54:21,350 --> 01:54:22,820
you can't have a women's only club 
either,

2486
01:54:23,720 --> 01:54:25,370
which is,
that makes sense.

2487
01:54:25,750 --> 01:54:27,920
S whatever.
Who gives a fuck?

2488
01:54:27,921 --> 01:54:30,770
Why do you want to like bother women?
Like leave him alone.

2489
01:54:30,830 --> 01:54:32,480
You don't want to think with women 
bothering men.

2490
01:54:32,510 --> 01:54:35,900
You don't want to get into get into 
politics class and Saturdays plot is,

2491
01:54:35,901 --> 01:54:38,360
is you can get in there,
but they have all women's bodies.

2492
01:54:38,600 --> 01:54:40,700
They're allowed to have all women's 
classes in places,

2493
01:54:40,750 --> 01:54:45,750
you know,
because especially when you're dealing 

2494
01:54:45,750 --> 01:54:48,131
with like exercise,
some women don't want to be fucking 

2495
01:54:48,131 --> 01:54:50,120
ogled by some shithead behind them while
you're doing downward dog for sure.

2496
01:54:50,200 --> 01:54:51,560
You know,
that makes sense.

2497
01:54:51,740 --> 01:54:54,590
But my point is why would you want to go
where you're not wanted?

2498
01:54:54,920 --> 01:54:55,220
You know,
we're,

2499
01:54:55,221 --> 01:54:58,490
we're not talking about like whites only
or blacks only.

2500
01:54:58,640 --> 01:55:00,980
We're talking about people that fuck,
okay,

2501
01:55:01,190 --> 01:55:06,190
when you're dealing with men and women,
you're dealing with sex and we're 

2502
01:55:06,190 --> 01:55:07,700
dealing with sex.
People should be allowed to get the fuck

2503
01:55:07,701 --> 01:55:09,620
away,
to have like a,

2504
01:55:09,680 --> 01:55:12,140
like an area where no one's trying to 
fuck you,

2505
01:55:12,410 --> 01:55:14,680
you know,
like have like a Freebie,

2506
01:55:14,720 --> 01:55:16,850
a base.
Like I'm free here,

2507
01:55:16,970 --> 01:55:19,430
like this is safe,
this is a safe base.

2508
01:55:19,880 --> 01:55:22,850
Like in like for a man to get upset.
They're like,

2509
01:55:22,851 --> 01:55:25,580
women want to have a place where men 
aren't allowed to go.

2510
01:55:25,730 --> 01:55:28,280
Seems ridiculous.
And for women to get upset,

2511
01:55:28,550 --> 01:55:32,240
unless men are plotting women's doom 
behind those doors,

2512
01:55:32,540 --> 01:55:34,820
like why would you care?
Why do you want to be in that room where

2513
01:55:34,821 --> 01:55:36,920
they only wanted to be men?
Why do you want to go in there?

2514
01:55:37,210 --> 01:55:42,210
Because they got really good steak and 
pipes in the case of keen can't keep 

2515
01:55:42,210 --> 01:55:43,890
that away from women forever so that,
that they got

2516
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:47,490
to go there before they got to vote 
because when did women get the vote?

2517
01:55:48,020 --> 01:55:50,140
That's a good point.
I think the teens right?

2518
01:55:50,150 --> 01:55:53,750
Like 1915 or something,
someone was to look that one up,

2519
01:55:54,260 --> 01:55:59,260
so teens gave in before.
They're more progressive than our 

2520
01:55:59,260 --> 01:56:03,281
country was about choosing the president
and some ways that steakhouse is more 

2521
01:56:03,281 --> 01:56:04,130
progressive than any other part of 
America.

2522
01:56:04,310 --> 01:56:05,000
You don't want,
man.

2523
01:56:05,090 --> 01:56:10,090
I've been changing my feeling about 
president slightly and now I think I 

2524
01:56:10,090 --> 01:56:14,471
will only vote for a woman president 
because I think women should have a 

2525
01:56:14,471 --> 01:56:16,520
chance to fuck this thing up to first of
all,

2526
01:56:16,790 --> 01:56:19,430
and we should.
We should be able to prove by a woman.

2527
01:56:19,460 --> 01:56:22,220
If a woman gets an office and the exact 
same things happened,

2528
01:56:22,670 --> 01:56:23,750
then we can go,
okay.

2529
01:56:24,440 --> 01:56:26,270
No one.
No one really gets a say.

2530
01:56:26,300 --> 01:56:28,310
They get in there.
I think we should just run through like,

2531
01:56:28,311 --> 01:56:29,480
all right,
we got a black guy,

2532
01:56:29,600 --> 01:56:31,640
Elizabeth Warren.
To me,

2533
01:56:31,641 --> 01:56:36,641
she seems very intelligent for a woman 
and that once we can establish that 

2534
01:56:36,641 --> 01:56:37,820
they're all corrupt and they all get 
corrupted,

2535
01:56:38,110 --> 01:56:43,110
that everybody's corrupt or not.
Maybe we'll find out that like it's a 

2536
01:56:43,110 --> 01:56:44,540
good idea to have a woman run things 
because women aren't more.

2537
01:56:44,600 --> 01:56:49,600
They're not as inclined start wars,
but we've already gotten the Margaret 

2538
01:56:49,600 --> 01:56:49,600
Thatcher's and whatnot.
You know,

2539
01:56:49,600 --> 01:56:50,360
I think women can get.

2540
01:56:51,020 --> 01:56:52,130
She wasn't,
it was,

2541
01:56:52,420 --> 01:56:57,420
that's not the same.
It's England's completely different 

2542
01:56:57,420 --> 01:56:57,420
system.
You know,

2543
01:56:57,420 --> 01:57:00,461
it's like,
I think in America there's never been a 

2544
01:57:00,461 --> 01:57:02,450
prominent political leader other than 
Hillary Clinton.

2545
01:57:02,451 --> 01:57:07,220
That's a woman and she and she never 
really quite reached any level of,

2546
01:57:07,790 --> 01:57:08,600
you know,
I mean,

2547
01:57:08,720 --> 01:57:11,000
she was never running things,
you know what I mean?

2548
01:57:11,060 --> 01:57:16,060
Never.
She was never a governor of a major 

2549
01:57:16,060 --> 01:57:16,060
state.
She was never a,

2550
01:57:16,060 --> 01:57:16,850
you know what I mean?
Like she,

2551
01:57:17,050 --> 01:57:22,050
what she did was she married one of the 
greatest presidents ever went through 

2552
01:57:22,050 --> 01:57:25,880
that whole thing and now she has a job 
working for the president and would like

2553
01:57:25,881 --> 01:57:28,880
to run for president,
whether it's her or Elizabeth Warren or.

2554
01:57:29,300 --> 01:57:34,300
My thinking is if every country was run 
by checks.

2555
01:57:34,990 --> 01:57:38,270
Okay.
How much less war and how much less.

2556
01:57:38,360 --> 01:57:43,360
Like how much less imperialism when we 
have how much less money grabs,

2557
01:57:45,110 --> 01:57:50,110
how much less it will,
all the decisions to like international 

2558
01:57:50,110 --> 01:57:50,210
shit was all being done by women.

2559
01:57:51,430 --> 01:57:53,690
I'm going to go with 25 to 30 percent 
less now.

2560
01:57:53,730 --> 01:57:55,000
I don't know.
It'd be interesting though.

2561
01:57:55,080 --> 01:57:56,710
Seems to make sense.
I mean,

2562
01:57:56,740 --> 01:57:58,460
I'm not patronizing.
I'm not bullshitting.

2563
01:57:58,490 --> 01:57:59,050
I'm,
I was,

2564
01:57:59,270 --> 01:58:00,920
I was really thinking about this the 
other day.

2565
01:58:01,250 --> 01:58:06,250
I was thinking if you look at the issues
that people have when it comes to 

2566
01:58:06,260 --> 01:58:08,480
whatever the president does,
so it's always two big ones.

2567
01:58:08,481 --> 01:58:10,070
Financial.
That's a big one.

2568
01:58:10,610 --> 01:58:12,350
And military.
Those are the,

2569
01:58:12,380 --> 01:58:15,530
those are two big issues that people 
always have with whatever president has.

2570
01:58:16,310 --> 01:58:21,310
And I think that women would be less 
likely to cause the military issues.

2571
01:58:22,910 --> 01:58:27,910
That's just a thought.
I just think there are less aggressive 

2572
01:58:27,910 --> 01:58:27,910
by nature.
They're more maternal.

2573
01:58:28,100 --> 01:58:29,090
They have this,
uh,

2574
01:58:29,240 --> 01:58:32,120
I mean they're,
they're the ones who become mothers.

2575
01:58:32,121 --> 01:58:37,121
I mean this,
this idea of conquering is a very male 

2576
01:58:37,121 --> 01:58:37,121
idea,

2577
01:58:37,540 --> 01:58:38,490
don't.
I don't think I'll.

2578
01:58:38,560 --> 01:58:42,250
I think the adversarial power thing just
happens.

2579
01:58:42,250 --> 01:58:47,250
If you're somebody who likes to rise in 
the ranks of power and it might be one 

2580
01:58:47,250 --> 01:58:49,280
of those things where it doesn't care so
much about your gender may be more,

2581
01:58:49,660 --> 01:58:51,100
but we can.
We can test it out.

2582
01:58:51,101 --> 01:58:53,620
We can try it out over the next 30 years
and see what happens.

2583
01:58:54,280 --> 01:58:59,280
I mean,
obviously I don't think that it should 

2584
01:58:59,280 --> 01:58:59,280
be only women.
I mean,

2585
01:58:59,280 --> 01:58:59,380
I think that would feel if a guy came 
along that really made sense,

2586
01:59:00,490 --> 01:59:03,010
but nobody makes sense.
Speaking of guy stuff,

2587
01:59:03,011 --> 01:59:04,330
I got to use the top.
Yeah.

2588
01:59:04,510 --> 01:59:05,970
All these motherfuckers,
ladies and gentlemen,

2589
01:59:05,980 --> 01:59:07,990
also known as they'll have weak 
bladders.

2590
01:59:08,200 --> 01:59:09,520
That's part of why we're doing this 
show.

2591
01:59:09,640 --> 01:59:12,520
I feed people coffee and I show them the
weaknesses.

2592
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,910
I show them that they can hang.
It can't just sit down and talk.

2593
01:59:16,270 --> 01:59:19,090
Sometimes I'll wait around after the 
show's over.

2594
01:59:19,090 --> 01:59:22,600
I'll take pictures with people and then 
I'll pay three hours.

2595
01:59:22,601 --> 01:59:24,070
Just doesn't seem like a long time.
To me.

2596
01:59:24,760 --> 01:59:28,120
That might be the number one flaw of 
this show though.

2597
01:59:28,390 --> 01:59:33,390
There might be a time in the future 
where I decide the best way to do the 

2598
01:59:33,791 --> 01:59:38,791
commercials is to prerecord them and 
then press play and allow the guest to 

2599
01:59:38,791 --> 01:59:43,501
go and pee because it comes a point in 
time where I know these motherfuckers 

2600
01:59:43,501 --> 01:59:45,430
are squirming.
I start seeing this shit.

2601
01:59:45,880 --> 01:59:49,060
I start seeing this sitting up and 
lifting back and they're thinking,

2602
01:59:49,090 --> 01:59:50,110
man,
do I say it?

2603
01:59:50,111 --> 01:59:50,950
No,
don't be a pussy.

2604
01:59:51,340 --> 01:59:52,360
Do I say it?
No,

2605
01:59:52,400 --> 01:59:52,960
no,
no,

2606
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:53,590
no,
no,

2607
01:59:54,190 --> 01:59:59,190
but there's a time.
Speaking of which I have to use the 

2608
01:59:59,190 --> 02:00:04,141
bathroom.
They always have that moment where 

2609
02:00:04,141 --> 02:00:05,881
they're like,
I said it and they go run off to the 

2610
02:00:05,881 --> 02:00:05,881
bathroom.
They have to train their bladder.

2611
02:00:05,881 --> 02:00:09,550
They have to train their discipline and 
their desire to podcast.

2612
02:00:09,880 --> 02:00:12,550
Right now I see a lot of people that are
tapping out early,

2613
02:00:12,670 --> 02:00:15,010
no drinking before podcasts.
Just drink.

2614
02:00:15,070 --> 02:00:20,070
Just don't be a pussy.
Like I don't understand what's going on 

2615
02:00:20,070 --> 02:00:22,861
with these people and their bladders.
I mean the kid had one bottle of water 

2616
02:00:22,861 --> 02:00:23,290
and a cup of coffee and it's fucking 
crying over there.

2617
02:00:24,110 --> 02:00:27,890
Been maybe he's really just checking 
it's bitcoins.

2618
02:00:28,180 --> 02:00:33,180
It was in that bathroom and just wants 
to find out what the current bit coin 

2619
02:00:33,180 --> 02:00:33,430
level is.
It's like,

2620
02:00:33,460 --> 02:00:34,990
God,
what is it right now?

2621
02:00:35,230 --> 02:00:36,120
What is it?
Right.

2622
02:00:36,150 --> 02:00:39,010
It gets up in the middle of the night,
has to be checks.

2623
02:00:39,011 --> 02:00:43,360
Is bitcoin a bill?
Burr will be here tomorrow.

2624
02:00:43,600 --> 02:00:45,020
Bill.
Bill Burr has a,

2625
02:00:45,100 --> 02:00:48,790
a new netflix special called,
sorry you feel that way.

2626
02:00:48,791 --> 02:00:53,791
It comes out this Friday,
December fifth and he's one of my 

2627
02:00:53,791 --> 02:00:55,570
favorite standup comedians ever.

2628
02:00:56,020 --> 02:00:58,330
And just an awesome guy.
I fucking love him.

2629
02:00:58,331 --> 02:00:59,940
He's real estate.
Get theirs.

2630
02:01:00,030 --> 02:01:05,030
There's comedians that they become 
famous and they become more humble and 

2631
02:01:05,081 --> 02:01:06,640
more cool.
And that's bill burr.

2632
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:10,420
He's a hard working motherfucker.
He's always writing new shit.

2633
02:01:10,450 --> 02:01:15,260
He was on our ice house show last 
Wednesday and uh,

2634
02:01:15,310 --> 02:01:19,450
he's just one of my favorite comics 
period just to one of my favorite dudes.

2635
02:01:19,451 --> 02:01:21,070
I just love talking to him and hanging 
out with him.

2636
02:01:21,071 --> 02:01:26,071
He's just such a regular guy and I that,
that expression like regular guys like 

2637
02:01:26,071 --> 02:01:30,301
so overused.
But what I like about someone like a 

2638
02:01:30,301 --> 02:01:31,720
bill burr is that once he's become 
famous,

2639
02:01:31,900 --> 02:01:33,850
what he's done is just sort of settle 
in,

2640
02:01:34,060 --> 02:01:36,370
being more comfortable with themselves,
very confident,

2641
02:01:36,520 --> 02:01:39,620
but worked extra hard.
He works harder now than ever before.

2642
02:01:39,640 --> 02:01:39,950
The guy

2643
02:01:39,990 --> 02:01:42,440
is always coming up with new material.
Barack Obama,

2644
02:01:42,441 --> 02:01:43,220
right?
That's who we're talking to.

2645
02:01:43,650 --> 02:01:47,030
Bill Burr.
You Fuck God Damn David Seaman.

2646
02:01:47,070 --> 02:01:47,690
You're weak.
Bladder.

2647
02:01:47,720 --> 02:01:49,610
Is it like a little girl's fist?
So your bladder,

2648
02:01:49,611 --> 02:01:50,580
Nick.
Little girl.

2649
02:01:51,120 --> 02:01:54,650
A little stronger and bigger.
It has a weakness for coffee.

2650
02:01:55,100 --> 02:01:56,040
That's what sets it off.
Well,

2651
02:01:56,060 --> 02:02:01,060
coffee is a diuretic.
It does run three too much of it's not 

2652
02:02:01,060 --> 02:02:05,381
good either.
You got to be careful with the coffee 

2653
02:02:05,381 --> 02:02:05,381
people out there.
They're fucking pound of that.

2654
02:02:05,381 --> 02:02:09,731
Apparently.
It's not good for the adrenals when you 

2655
02:02:09,731 --> 02:02:12,011
drink too much of it.
Today we have a lovely caveman coffee 

2656
02:02:12,011 --> 02:02:13,640
blend.
Single source.

2657
02:02:13,850 --> 02:02:16,100
Quite delicious.
Drinking it black.

2658
02:02:17,780 --> 02:02:18,920
No,
no butter today.

2659
02:02:19,790 --> 02:02:21,560
I think I might be drink drinking a 
little too much.

2660
02:02:21,561 --> 02:02:22,280
Butter.
Coffee.

2661
02:02:22,820 --> 02:02:27,820
So it's fucking with my voice.
A little accuse me that like coats your 

2662
02:02:27,820 --> 02:02:31,871
mouth.
Sometimes you're talking and it's like 

2663
02:02:31,871 --> 02:02:31,871
you're tons wrestling with slime.

2664
02:02:31,871 --> 02:02:32,960
The inside of your mouth.
Slime.

2665
02:02:33,290 --> 02:02:35,960
Do a warmup exercise before you go out 
and perform.

2666
02:02:36,230 --> 02:02:38,870
Do you have to do stand standup?
I stretch.

2667
02:02:39,350 --> 02:02:42,950
So what I'd like to do to stretch,
to like bend over,

2668
02:02:43,580 --> 02:02:48,580
uh,
usually with my back against the wall 

2669
02:02:48,580 --> 02:02:50,420
and nobody does anything weird and grab 
my ankles and pull my head in between my

2670
02:02:50,421 --> 02:02:54,080
legs and stretch my entire spine and my 
hamstrings.

2671
02:02:54,320 --> 02:02:56,210
And it gets a lot of blood flow to the 
brain.

2672
02:02:56,360 --> 02:02:57,890
That helps you voice?
No,

2673
02:02:58,080 --> 02:02:58,850
no,
no,

2674
02:02:58,851 --> 02:02:59,690
no.
My mouth.

2675
02:02:59,691 --> 02:03:02,000
And I'll stretch my mouth.
I just go up there and talk.

2676
02:03:02,690 --> 02:03:05,330
It's not that hard to talk David Seaman.
Not at all.

2677
02:03:05,360 --> 02:03:07,610
You don't have to warm up for it.
It's not like I'm going up there and I'm

2678
02:03:07,611 --> 02:03:09,510
singing opera.
No.

2679
02:03:09,770 --> 02:03:11,080
True.
No.

2680
02:03:11,960 --> 02:03:13,790
Warm up a little bit.
I get fired up,

2681
02:03:14,080 --> 02:03:19,080
you know,
especially if I have bits and I'm 

2682
02:03:19,080 --> 02:03:19,080
working on and stuff like that.

2683
02:03:19,080 --> 02:03:20,500
I'll get into those bits.
Go.

2684
02:03:20,540 --> 02:03:24,230
I always bring a notebook so I have like
a mental warmup to go over the notes.

2685
02:03:25,180 --> 02:03:28,610
You got to do that too,
like performing a lot is important,

2686
02:03:28,611 --> 02:03:30,710
but just like some of the different 
aspects,

2687
02:03:30,770 --> 02:03:32,570
you've got to perform a,
you've got to read a lot.

2688
02:03:32,571 --> 02:03:37,571
You gotta write a lot.
Like right now I'm in the new new 

2689
02:03:37,571 --> 02:03:40,781
material phase,
so now I'm trying to expose myself to 

2690
02:03:40,781 --> 02:03:40,781
weird shit.
That's why I was watching.

2691
02:03:40,781 --> 02:03:44,480
I've been watching a lot of 
documentaries and I'm just trying to not

2692
02:03:44,481 --> 02:03:49,481
even necessarily like actively pursue 
new material as much as try to expose 

2693
02:03:50,211 --> 02:03:55,211
myself to a bunch of things and then 
ideas will come and then I sit down and 

2694
02:03:55,211 --> 02:03:56,510
write and then when I write then more 
ideas come.

2695
02:03:56,540 --> 02:04:00,050
But like,
I mean this just the open,

2696
02:04:00,830 --> 02:04:03,920
open your head up and look around phase,
you know?

2697
02:04:05,210 --> 02:04:06,830
Cool.
You see yesterday,

2698
02:04:06,831 --> 02:04:11,831
uh,
they launched another other as supposed 

2699
02:04:11,831 --> 02:04:11,831
to launch another probe to an asteroid.
Another one,

2700
02:04:11,831 --> 02:04:16,511
Huh?
This Japanese guy will have dicks all 

2701
02:04:16,511 --> 02:04:17,180
over his shirt and that'll cause a big 
controversy.

2702
02:04:17,560 --> 02:04:22,080
A Japanese guy has the NASA guy of the 
Nasa Guy who had a,

2703
02:04:22,110 --> 02:04:25,490
the sexy women all over his shirt and 
women got really upset with that.

2704
02:04:26,950 --> 02:04:31,950
It's amazing.
It's funny the things people will get 

2705
02:04:31,950 --> 02:04:34,400
outraged over and meanwhile it's like 
there's a constant churn of people being

2706
02:04:34,401 --> 02:04:39,401
slaughtered and parts of the world and 
it's like we're going to focus twitter 

2707
02:04:39,401 --> 02:04:42,531
rage on the NASA engineer.
They're all people that no one wants to 

2708
02:04:42,531 --> 02:04:43,410
fuck everyone's mad.
That's what it is.

2709
02:04:43,620 --> 02:04:45,990
If they're getting stuffed on a regular 
basis,

2710
02:04:45,991 --> 02:04:50,991
they're not super sad.
They're not getting laid and they have 

2711
02:04:50,991 --> 02:04:50,991
no,
no weed at their apartment.

2712
02:04:50,991 --> 02:04:54,560
So exactly their friends or not that 
cool and they're super into their own 

2713
02:04:54,560 --> 02:04:54,560
gender.

2714
02:04:54,630 --> 02:04:56,880
They're really into like their gender 
not being exploited.

2715
02:04:58,260 --> 02:05:03,260
But if you were a chick though,
seriously have to play devil's advocate 

2716
02:05:03,260 --> 02:05:07,130
and you know,
you're trying to be taken seriously in 

2717
02:05:07,130 --> 02:05:10,611
science and you were really serious 
about women in science and then here's 

2718
02:05:10,611 --> 02:05:14,931
the fucking guy who lands a robot on a 
comment and he's wearing like hot chicks

2719
02:05:16,420 --> 02:05:18,240
haulover shirt.
He didn't like,

2720
02:05:18,241 --> 02:05:20,050
what the fuck dude?
Like,

2721
02:05:20,180 --> 02:05:25,180
come on man.
You can't just wear a tee shirt that 

2722
02:05:25,180 --> 02:05:25,180
says nasa on it or something like,
yeah,

2723
02:05:25,180 --> 02:05:27,030
I get your friend made.
You sure I get it.

2724
02:05:27,031 --> 02:05:27,990
I get it.
I get it,

2725
02:05:28,440 --> 02:05:31,050
but you didn't have to wear that,
so I see both sides.

2726
02:05:31,200 --> 02:05:33,990
I see.
It's really stupid to get super upset.

2727
02:05:34,140 --> 02:05:39,140
I mean there's.
There are ridiculous articles that 

2728
02:05:39,140 --> 02:05:41,241
completely missed the point.
The fascinating point of this comment 

2729
02:05:41,241 --> 02:05:43,410
being like the first place we've gotten 
a robot to land on,

2730
02:05:43,590 --> 02:05:48,590
you know,
and to have this happen in real time 

2731
02:05:48,590 --> 02:05:52,071
while these people were experiencing it,
watching the monitors and everybody's 

2732
02:05:52,071 --> 02:05:56,181
going crazy to to to focus instead on 
the guy's shirt and did make entire 

2733
02:05:56,181 --> 02:05:56,670
articles.

2734
02:05:56,670 --> 02:06:00,690
All of your focus is on the guy's shirt.
Seems very shortsighted.

2735
02:06:01,110 --> 02:06:06,110
Very shortsighted.
That's one of the things the aliens 

2736
02:06:06,110 --> 02:06:06,570
would skip us over for.
They would just start laughing.

2737
02:06:06,571 --> 02:06:07,110
They're like,
these.

2738
02:06:07,120 --> 02:06:09,150
They're just so concerned about fucking 
like,

2739
02:06:09,151 --> 02:06:09,530
look,
this isn't.

2740
02:06:09,780 --> 02:06:13,500
The girls on his shirt are sexually 
attractive.

2741
02:06:13,501 --> 02:06:15,810
They're much more sexually attracted in 
the women that are complaining about the

2742
02:06:15,811 --> 02:06:17,090
girls shirt.
Huh?

2743
02:06:17,760 --> 02:06:22,760
That's one thing.
If you look at all the twitter accounts 

2744
02:06:22,760 --> 02:06:25,221
of all the women that were really 
adamant about the fact this guy was an 

2745
02:06:25,221 --> 02:06:28,491
asshole for wearing that shirt.
I went to their photos and I looked at 

2746
02:06:28,491 --> 02:06:30,600
all of them and I'm sure they're nice 
people,

2747
02:06:30,930 --> 02:06:35,010
but if you saw them in the same outfits 
as those women on the shirt,

2748
02:06:35,190 --> 02:06:39,780
you would throw up in your mouth there.
They're all people that have given up on

2749
02:06:39,781 --> 02:06:42,090
the idea of somebody being attracted to 
them physically,

2750
02:06:42,091 --> 02:06:45,000
so they're not entourage extras that 
what you're telling me they've given up.

2751
02:06:45,480 --> 02:06:50,480
They've.
They're into science and they're not 

2752
02:06:50,480 --> 02:06:51,090
into being slender.
They're not into looking good.

2753
02:06:51,270 --> 02:06:56,270
They're into becoming more square shaped
and complaining a lot.

2754
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:05,000
Well,
it's good that they have an outlet for 

2755
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:07,131
that.
Anger is hopefully it'll be a more 

2756
02:07:07,131 --> 02:07:08,010
worthy one in the future than somebody 
who's putting probes on a comet.

2757
02:07:08,200 --> 02:07:13,200
I wonder if there's ever going to come a
point in time where we have three types 

2758
02:07:13,651 --> 02:07:15,750
of genders.
We have male,

2759
02:07:15,960 --> 02:07:20,960
female in non.
Like if we get to a point where people 

2760
02:07:22,710 --> 02:07:27,710
get to a stage of life and they just 
completely give up on any gender 

2761
02:07:28,500 --> 02:07:32,640
whatsoever and they assimilate into this
non form.

2762
02:07:33,570 --> 02:07:36,070
Like if that becomes an option and like 
people start saying,

2763
02:07:36,071 --> 02:07:39,010
look,
think about all the problems that sexual

2764
02:07:39,011 --> 02:07:44,011
identity causes.
You think about all the mis-gendering 

2765
02:07:44,011 --> 02:07:48,430
things all the times where you're 
supposed to think one way,

2766
02:07:48,431 --> 02:07:51,670
but you really think another and it's 
very confusing and frustrating.

2767
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,490
If you were a non,
you wouldn't have to worry about that.

2768
02:07:54,491 --> 02:07:57,100
If more people became nones and recent 
survey,

2769
02:07:57,220 --> 02:08:01,210
17 percent of America said,
if given the choice to have a completely

2770
02:08:01,211 --> 02:08:03,940
nonsexual existence,
they would do it.

2771
02:08:04,020 --> 02:08:06,010
They would be really annoying though.
They would be worse,

2772
02:08:06,011 --> 02:08:08,160
not worse than the,
uh,

2773
02:08:08,560 --> 02:08:11,590
atheists on reddit.
Even like,

2774
02:08:11,591 --> 02:08:12,820
Jesus,
these nones,

2775
02:08:12,821 --> 02:08:17,821
again,
they would just take up whole 

2776
02:08:17,821 --> 02:08:17,821
discussion.
Third gender thing already.

2777
02:08:17,821 --> 02:08:22,130
Whoa.
A third concept that individuals are 

2778
02:08:22,331 --> 02:08:25,140
categorized.
I can't read it up there at all.

2779
02:08:25,190 --> 02:08:29,060
Neither man nor woman,
as well as the social category president

2780
02:08:29,061 --> 02:08:32,600
in those societies who recognized three 
or more genders.

2781
02:08:34,290 --> 02:08:35,820
Well,
that's an old picture too.

2782
02:08:35,821 --> 02:08:37,560
So that means that shit's been going on 
for a long time.

2783
02:08:37,580 --> 02:08:41,130
Tom NFP lived as a man for many years in
Germany,

2784
02:08:41,190 --> 02:08:45,870
was photographed for this book in 1922 
sexual intermediate.

2785
02:08:46,200 --> 02:08:51,200
Wow,
well you know how you know the son of 

2786
02:08:51,200 --> 02:08:51,240
man living the hands.
Solaris.

2787
02:08:51,510 --> 02:08:56,510
Isn't that hilarious?
Like look at her giant ass head like 

2788
02:08:56,510 --> 02:08:57,000
that's a dude head and then get down to 
those hands.

2789
02:08:57,030 --> 02:08:59,510
Oh chickens,
right.

2790
02:09:00,120 --> 02:09:02,490
Look at south smaller hands are in 
comparison.

2791
02:09:02,491 --> 02:09:06,030
That giant Mellon as glasses at some 
vintage.

2792
02:09:06,031 --> 02:09:09,120
Warby Parker's going on.
Whatever that is.

2793
02:09:09,990 --> 02:09:13,380
Non Sex because of no one's fucking you.
Okay.

2794
02:09:13,530 --> 02:09:15,560
If you reached that point in time,
you know,

2795
02:09:15,561 --> 02:09:17,130
you're like,
you're in your fifties,

2796
02:09:17,190 --> 02:09:18,780
you're a scientist.
No one's fucking,

2797
02:09:18,781 --> 02:09:20,850
you know,
you're five foot six,

2798
02:09:21,030 --> 02:09:21,810
200,
200,

2799
02:09:21,811 --> 02:09:26,811
15 pounds below square and just give 
given up just so you can still go to 

2800
02:09:27,061 --> 02:09:28,410
burning man.
Somebody will fuck you,

2801
02:09:28,710 --> 02:09:30,840
but you don't maybe know more.
You just don't want it.

2802
02:09:30,841 --> 02:09:31,380
Okay,
cool.

2803
02:09:31,680 --> 02:09:32,760
Done.
He's just done.

2804
02:09:33,240 --> 02:09:38,240
And you can just become a non.
There's benefits because for females 

2805
02:09:38,240 --> 02:09:42,951
that they,
they reach like a higher level of 

2806
02:09:42,951 --> 02:09:42,951
physical strength.

2807
02:09:42,951 --> 02:09:45,830
They get closer to man,
this is the symbol for non so they can 

2808
02:09:45,830 --> 02:09:45,830
recognize each other.
The international symbol.

2809
02:09:46,360 --> 02:09:48,960
I mean,
we define ourselves by our sex even when

2810
02:09:48,961 --> 02:09:53,400
no one wants to fuck you mean that's 
your gender essentially.

2811
02:09:53,460 --> 02:09:57,120
Like what is it supposed to mean mean 
you're a female in the wrong bathroom,

2812
02:09:57,290 --> 02:09:58,470
you go to jail,
right?

2813
02:09:58,471 --> 02:09:59,490
That's true.
Being loud,

2814
02:09:59,720 --> 02:10:03,030
but if you're a transgender,
they're trying to argue that transgender

2815
02:10:03,060 --> 02:10:08,060
men should be able to use a men's 
bathrooms and transgender women should 

2816
02:10:08,060 --> 02:10:09,260
be able to use women's bathrooms even 
when they were born,

2817
02:10:09,270 --> 02:10:11,670
the opposite sex and some people have an
issue with that.

2818
02:10:12,690 --> 02:10:15,840
Some people get upset at that.
Yeah.

2819
02:10:17,940 --> 02:10:20,310
It's funny how little I think about 
things like this.

2820
02:10:20,660 --> 02:10:23,370
You know,
if you think about like gender,

2821
02:10:23,670 --> 02:10:27,450
like male and female once.
I mean obviously you're,

2822
02:10:28,190 --> 02:10:33,190
you can get pregnant,
one can get the other pregnant and once 

2823
02:10:33,190 --> 02:10:33,190
you pass all that,
once you get to this point,

2824
02:10:33,190 --> 02:10:34,220
you're not having sex anymore.

2825
02:10:34,550 --> 02:10:36,560
Like you're in your fifties or something
like that.

2826
02:10:37,100 --> 02:10:40,910
When you,
when you think about what you are like,

2827
02:10:40,911 --> 02:10:45,911
you're thinking about it based on the 
fact that you have a vagina or you have 

2828
02:10:45,911 --> 02:10:48,971
a penis,
but you're no longer interested in 

2829
02:10:48,971 --> 02:10:48,971
sexual intercourse.
If you no longer,

2830
02:10:48,971 --> 02:10:52,850
it doesn't sound like a burden to be 
defined by one or the other,

2831
02:10:53,070 --> 02:10:58,070
like instead of just being a human,
if you're not fucking see it become a 

2832
02:10:58,070 --> 02:10:58,070
non.
Then you become a nun.

2833
02:10:58,100 --> 02:10:59,660
There we go.
So you take,

2834
02:10:59,960 --> 02:11:01,760
what is this on binary?
No,

2835
02:11:01,770 --> 02:11:06,770
Google says non binary genders are 
gender identities that don't fit within 

2836
02:11:06,770 --> 02:11:10,890
the accepted binary of male and female 
people can feel they are both neither or

2837
02:11:10,900 --> 02:11:11,660
something.
See,

2838
02:11:11,661 --> 02:11:16,661
but the problem with this is with all 
due respect is that this perhaps at 

2839
02:11:16,661 --> 02:11:19,130
least on some folks is a psychological 
issue.

2840
02:11:19,160 --> 02:11:20,240
And I'm not talking about that.

2841
02:11:20,450 --> 02:11:23,600
I'm talking about like literally not 
being male or female,

2842
02:11:23,750 --> 02:11:28,750
like building being neither being 
nonsexual and like if it becomes that 

2843
02:11:28,750 --> 02:11:31,820
option and they give you an option where
you can walk around and you look like,

2844
02:11:31,870 --> 02:11:34,070
like one of those gray aliens.
It doesn't have genitals.

2845
02:11:34,490 --> 02:11:37,070
Well I,
I have a couple of friends who are women

2846
02:11:37,071 --> 02:11:39,110
and if you start to treat them in a 
certain way,

2847
02:11:39,880 --> 02:11:40,830
uh,
they're like,

2848
02:11:40,940 --> 02:11:41,930
what the fuck is this?
You know,

2849
02:11:41,931 --> 02:11:46,280
because they don't really fall into the 
female gender assumptions.

2850
02:11:46,281 --> 02:11:49,070
Like there's still women and they do 
things that women do,

2851
02:11:49,071 --> 02:11:52,490
but they don't like to be treated like 
anything other than what they are,

2852
02:11:52,491 --> 02:11:54,710
which is not very feminine.
Like a couple of my friends.

2853
02:11:54,770 --> 02:11:57,050
What do you mean by don't like to be 
treated?

2854
02:11:57,710 --> 02:11:59,900
There's a way that certain guys act 
around the women.

2855
02:12:00,440 --> 02:12:05,440
It's kind of like a,
a low level anxiety because you're 

2856
02:12:05,440 --> 02:12:08,060
seeking out their acceptance because 
you're like,

2857
02:12:08,300 --> 02:12:11,630
their acceptance means that I'm sexually
attractive.

2858
02:12:11,900 --> 02:12:16,900
Right?
So even if they're not going to fuck 

2859
02:12:16,900 --> 02:12:18,401
you,
you still want them to like you and 

2860
02:12:18,401 --> 02:12:19,841
laugh at your,
your stuff and like you're trying to 

2861
02:12:19,841 --> 02:12:20,360
impress them in a way.
But there are women who are like,

2862
02:12:20,361 --> 02:12:21,470
no,
like we're friends now.

2863
02:12:21,471 --> 02:12:22,620
We're buddies.
Right?

2864
02:12:22,700 --> 02:12:25,280
You wouldn't be like this with one of 
your friends,

2865
02:12:25,281 --> 02:12:30,281
so why would you be like this with me?
And like interject gender into 

2866
02:12:30,281 --> 02:12:30,710
everything when I'm not doing that.
Well,

2867
02:12:30,740 --> 02:12:32,840
they're probably smart.
I mean that is,

2868
02:12:32,910 --> 02:12:37,400
it's just that is a real issue with 
women and men and it's gross to see when

2869
02:12:37,401 --> 02:12:40,310
you're around your friends and then a 
girl comes over and you always have that

2870
02:12:40,311 --> 02:12:45,311
one dude who like completely changes.
It's about to not as pants and really 

2871
02:12:46,250 --> 02:12:47,750
interact as a human being.
Yeah.

2872
02:12:47,810 --> 02:12:52,810
Changes who he is like this fundamental.
Like the motivation for his 

2873
02:12:52,810 --> 02:12:56,270
communication changes and we've all been
that person before.

2874
02:12:56,340 --> 02:12:59,330
Oh yeah.
It's just a matter of like.

2875
02:12:59,331 --> 02:13:04,190
I think it's just genetics.
I think it's neat that a woman is as far

2876
02:13:04,191 --> 02:13:09,191
from one of us says you can get while 
still being the same species and that's 

2877
02:13:09,321 --> 02:13:14,321
not at all meant to be a sexist thing.
It's just like if you look at what you 

2878
02:13:14,321 --> 02:13:14,321
are,
your biology,

2879
02:13:14,321 --> 02:13:18,941
your Oregon's a woman is having as much 
of a different experience as possible 

2880
02:13:19,850 --> 02:13:22,670
while still being the same exact species
as you and vice versa.

2881
02:13:23,180 --> 02:13:28,180
That's true.
The male experience is different from a 

2882
02:13:28,180 --> 02:13:30,491
woman's in many ways and so it's this 
weird thing where instead of dividing 

2883
02:13:30,491 --> 02:13:31,010
over it,
we can come together and be.

2884
02:13:31,110 --> 02:13:31,980
That's Kinda cool.
You

2885
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:33,630
guys get to do this,
this and this.

2886
02:13:33,960 --> 02:13:36,780
We do this and I'm just kind of 
intrigued by it.

2887
02:13:36,781 --> 02:13:38,610
I'm not intimidated by it.
I think it's cool.

2888
02:13:38,730 --> 02:13:43,730
You're different.
You're open mind and you should get 

2889
02:13:43,730 --> 02:13:46,371
wooden beads.
I should should start doing yoga and 

2890
02:13:46,371 --> 02:13:47,070
just write this in a book and sell it.
You know?

2891
02:13:47,370 --> 02:13:50,940
I think David has that one down.
He's got a couple of,

2892
02:13:51,030 --> 02:13:56,030
a couple of million copies that had to 
do that guy put some shit up on twitter 

2893
02:13:56,030 --> 02:13:57,210
every few months and I have to comment 
on.

2894
02:13:57,270 --> 02:13:59,940
I love him.
It's like just macro trolling.

2895
02:14:00,090 --> 02:14:03,030
I can't help him because he writes shit 
and it's just,

2896
02:14:03,031 --> 02:14:06,270
it's the aware system,
the awareness over and over again.

2897
02:14:06,870 --> 02:14:11,870
He's just saying Mumbo jumbo.
Have you ever seen the Deepak Chopra a 

2898
02:14:11,870 --> 02:14:12,420
sentence generator?
No.

2899
02:14:13,050 --> 02:14:14,660
It's so ridiculous.
You just,

2900
02:14:14,720 --> 02:14:19,720
you,
you click on it and it randomly spits 

2901
02:14:19,720 --> 02:14:19,720
out a bunch of metaphysical words,
connected,

2902
02:14:19,720 --> 02:14:20,340
you know,
interconnectedness,

2903
02:14:20,580 --> 02:14:24,170
quantum in the quantum level and it just
be a console horseshit.

2904
02:14:24,250 --> 02:14:29,250
He,
he's like the most ineffective complex 

2905
02:14:29,250 --> 02:14:32,601
communicator ever and I,
when I told them what's really 

2906
02:14:32,601 --> 02:14:34,230
hilarious,
a bunch of people were explaining to him

2907
02:14:34,320 --> 02:14:39,320
to me what he meant and they're serious.
It's like know what he means is by 

2908
02:14:39,320 --> 02:14:39,320
awareness like,
Hey,

2909
02:14:39,321 --> 02:14:41,460
shut the fuck up.
Shut the fuck up.

2910
02:14:41,490 --> 02:14:46,490
Stop what he means.
You don't know what the fuck he means 

2911
02:14:46,490 --> 02:14:46,490
first of all,
and you know what I mean?

2912
02:14:46,490 --> 02:14:51,260
I mean,
this is a super ineffective way of 

2913
02:14:51,260 --> 02:14:53,601
communicating.
He knows and you know that that is some 

2914
02:14:53,601 --> 02:14:54,660
fucking sloppy shit.
That sentence is ridiculous.

2915
02:14:54,780 --> 02:14:56,680
It's preposterous.
It's not.

2916
02:14:56,690 --> 02:14:59,040
It's not very clear at all what he's 
saying.

2917
02:14:59,070 --> 02:15:03,600
It is a bunch of fucking Mumbo jumbo.
It is a bunch of word salad.

2918
02:15:03,750 --> 02:15:08,750
There's no question about it,
like if you want it to be really clear 

2919
02:15:08,750 --> 02:15:12,320
as to what you were saying,
but there's part of what goes on with a 

2920
02:15:12,320 --> 02:15:13,560
lot of these spiritual type thinkers.

2921
02:15:13,830 --> 02:15:16,410
People that talk about the quantum level
and all this,

2922
02:15:16,680 --> 02:15:21,680
this weird metaphysical Mumbo jumbo talk
is that keeping things mysterious is a 

2923
02:15:21,871 --> 02:15:25,140
huge part of the hustle.
You have to keep things mysterious.

2924
02:15:25,830 --> 02:15:30,830
Simplifying things is the worst thing 
you can do when you look at people that 

2925
02:15:30,830 --> 02:15:34,860
are trying to explain science,
to really try to explain science.

2926
02:15:34,861 --> 02:15:39,861
Look at Neil degrasse Tyson's twitter 
feed and you'll see a guy who explains 

2927
02:15:39,861 --> 02:15:44,541
things very clearly.
You never read a Neil degrasse Tyson 

2928
02:15:44,541 --> 02:15:45,720
tweet and go,
what the fuck did he mean by that?

2929
02:15:45,990 --> 02:15:47,350
It's real clear.
What do you mean?

2930
02:15:47,390 --> 02:15:49,590
You know why?
Because he's an awesome communicator.

2931
02:15:49,770 --> 02:15:50,940
What are you showing up there,
buddy?

2932
02:15:52,220 --> 02:15:53,130
What do you,
what do you got here?

2933
02:15:53,720 --> 02:15:55,620
Oh,
the chopra thing.

2934
02:15:56,460 --> 02:15:57,540
Oh,
but we can't see that.

2935
02:15:57,970 --> 02:15:59,860
I bet.
No,

2936
02:15:59,910 --> 02:16:01,200
I'm,
I'm seeing it on the scrambler.

2937
02:16:01,230 --> 02:16:02,580
What is he doing?
I don't even know what's happening.

2938
02:16:02,580 --> 02:16:04,740
We're talking and there's a video in the
same time.

2939
02:16:05,210 --> 02:16:10,210
Um,
I did like one of his books back in the 

2940
02:16:10,210 --> 02:16:10,210
day though.
The,

2941
02:16:10,210 --> 02:16:11,730
a seven spiritual laws of success.
He's got some good ideas.

2942
02:16:12,360 --> 02:16:16,230
Quantum physics unfolds into total 
acceptance of neural networks.

2943
02:16:16,470 --> 02:16:17,800
Oh,
is this one of the generators,

2944
02:16:18,550 --> 02:16:23,160
the generator and the Higgs Boson fears 
species specific opportunities?

2945
02:16:23,161 --> 02:16:24,630
Yeah.
These seem totally real.

2946
02:16:24,660 --> 02:16:27,030
They seem totally real,
but that's what he's doing.

2947
02:16:27,031 --> 02:16:28,770
I mean,
this is exactly what he's doing.

2948
02:16:28,771 --> 02:16:33,771
He's a bunch of shit and some of it,
I mean you can kind of interpret it if 

2949
02:16:34,601 --> 02:16:36,730
you like,
into some sort of a,

2950
02:16:36,820 --> 02:16:41,820
a valid sentence,
but the reality is he's really super 

2951
02:16:41,820 --> 02:16:42,580
ineffective with how he forms these 
sentences and the con,

2952
02:16:42,610 --> 02:16:47,610
the thoughts that are being conveyed.
Whereas if you go to Neil degrasse 

2953
02:16:47,610 --> 02:16:50,880
Tyson's twitter feed,
it's super obvious what he's saying 

2954
02:16:50,880 --> 02:16:52,240
really obvious and I'm like,
I might say I'm an idiot,

2955
02:16:52,241 --> 02:16:57,241
I'm Kinda dumb,
but I'm not dumb enough that I don't 

2956
02:16:57,241 --> 02:16:57,830
know when you're being a fucking idiot,
you know,

2957
02:16:58,030 --> 02:16:58,990
I know what you're doing.

2958
02:16:59,050 --> 02:17:03,640
You're just splashing a bunch of words 
together and trying to pretend like this

2959
02:17:03,641 --> 02:17:06,820
is some deep sentence.
This is poorly thought out shit.

2960
02:17:07,250 --> 02:17:09,670
And people gobble it up because they 
love it.

2961
02:17:09,700 --> 02:17:11,170
They love that.
That whole,

2962
02:17:11,370 --> 02:17:13,840
the whole package,
the brown skin,

2963
02:17:13,841 --> 02:17:16,300
the Indian background,
the whole deal.

2964
02:17:16,510 --> 02:17:19,000
Please Swami,
please Kumaré.

2965
02:17:19,330 --> 02:17:23,560
Teach me the way you see that 
documentary.

2966
02:17:23,590 --> 02:17:24,280
No,
I haven't seen it,

2967
02:17:24,281 --> 02:17:25,840
but I know it's unethical.
It was awesome.

2968
02:17:25,870 --> 02:17:27,820
It's a great premise.
Go around as a fake.

2969
02:17:28,300 --> 02:17:31,030
It's sad though when the people were 
like super into him,

2970
02:17:31,290 --> 02:17:32,080
you know,
it's sad.

2971
02:17:32,081 --> 02:17:37,081
They're crying that he's actually there 
with them and you realize he's that he 

2972
02:17:37,081 --> 02:17:38,410
actually is having this positive effect 
on these people because they're so lost.

2973
02:17:38,411 --> 02:17:40,510
They're like,
really need him to be that guy.

2974
02:17:41,770 --> 02:17:46,770
People really do you know,
want that one person to be so connected.

2975
02:17:47,530 --> 02:17:51,490
They don't realize that what you should 
be seeking is your own.

2976
02:17:51,880 --> 02:17:56,880
Instead of seeking like this one person 
who's going to be your guru is going to 

2977
02:17:56,880 --> 02:17:59,620
show you the way.
Seek your own experiences,

2978
02:17:59,740 --> 02:18:04,720
seek your own enlightening moments,
whether it's through yoga,

2979
02:18:04,750 --> 02:18:07,870
through meditation,
sensory deprivation tank,

2980
02:18:07,871 --> 02:18:12,871
psychedelic study,
whether it's through fucking hiking and 

2981
02:18:12,871 --> 02:18:12,871
thinking,
just being alone by yourself,

2982
02:18:12,871 --> 02:18:15,670
whether it's through writing,
whether it's through exploring ideas,

2983
02:18:15,850 --> 02:18:18,760
whatever the fuck it is,
seek your own answers to stuff,

2984
02:18:18,761 --> 02:18:23,761
but the idea that you're going to come 
across this one master that hasn't 

2985
02:18:23,761 --> 02:18:24,670
nailed the,
throw that away,

2986
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:27,490
throw that away.
If you meet the Buddha in the road,

2987
02:18:27,700 --> 02:18:28,870
kill him.
I mean,

2988
02:18:28,871 --> 02:18:32,070
that's,
that's the old expression that said,

2989
02:18:32,170 --> 02:18:34,120
throw that shit away.
Like you don't.

2990
02:18:34,270 --> 02:18:39,270
Don't want to find a fucking master 
because they don't exist.

2991
02:18:39,820 --> 02:18:44,820
You're going to get roped into.
You might find people that are 

2992
02:18:44,820 --> 02:18:47,281
beautiful,
that have an incredible grasp of 

2993
02:18:47,281 --> 02:18:50,791
reality,
but as soon as they start pushing 

2994
02:18:50,791 --> 02:18:53,350
themselves as a master run that 
somebody's trying to sell you a book,

2995
02:18:54,940 --> 02:18:57,190
someone trying to tell you that they get
it.

2996
02:18:57,280 --> 02:19:02,280
Watch decoding depok ever see the 
fucking documentary his own son made his

2997
02:19:02,831 --> 02:19:04,870
son,
made a documentary on him,

2998
02:19:04,871 --> 02:19:07,420
clowning him where he catches a 
meditating and he's.

2999
02:19:07,450 --> 02:19:08,740
He's like,
I'm going to go meditate,

3000
02:19:08,741 --> 02:19:11,190
and he catches them snoring.
Videotapes that,

3001
02:19:11,230 --> 02:19:15,130
these splices that altogether showing it
and it makes him look so ridiculous.

3002
02:19:15,250 --> 02:19:20,250
And to Deepak's credit,
he actually went on opiod anthony with 

3003
02:19:20,250 --> 02:19:22,070
his son and talked about like,
you know that he's,

3004
02:19:22,090 --> 02:19:23,400
you know,
he's just a normal person.

3005
02:19:23,430 --> 02:19:26,770
He says who he is and his son made a 
documentary about him but his sunrail he

3006
02:19:26,780 --> 02:19:29,690
clowned him in this documentary.
I'll have to check that out.

3007
02:19:29,720 --> 02:19:31,010
Oh my God.
You have to see it.

3008
02:19:31,011 --> 02:19:32,570
You should eat.
At least watch the trailer.

3009
02:19:32,870 --> 02:19:34,430
It's just,
it's so ridiculous.

3010
02:19:34,460 --> 02:19:39,460
It's his son,
like really clowned him and just makes 

3011
02:19:39,460 --> 02:19:42,491
you realize like what it must have been 
like to grow up with this guy as your 

3012
02:19:42,491 --> 02:19:45,881
dad,
like spouting his son is very smart to 

3013
02:19:45,881 --> 02:19:49,060
the sun was on Opie and anthony with 
them and you kind of sense first of all 

3014
02:19:49,060 --> 02:19:50,750
a that he really does love his dad,
his dad,

3015
02:19:50,780 --> 02:19:52,370
he knows his dad is not a terrible 
person,

3016
02:19:52,670 --> 02:19:56,660
but you could sense the sort of 
frustration and you know,

3017
02:19:56,661 --> 02:20:01,661
the difference between like whose dad 
actually is and like this menopausal 

3018
02:20:02,420 --> 02:20:04,880
misconception that these,
you know,

3019
02:20:04,940 --> 02:20:07,490
it's a lot of lost women and older men.

3020
02:20:07,580 --> 02:20:09,760
I mean I say menopausal male menopause 
as well.

3021
02:20:09,761 --> 02:20:14,761
Like there's older people searching,
searching for spirituality that stumble 

3022
02:20:14,761 --> 02:20:16,790
on the bookstore.
They find work stack of his books.

3023
02:20:16,791 --> 02:20:21,791
Yeah,
well I've always been metaphysical at 

3024
02:20:21,791 --> 02:20:21,791
heart.
You know,

3025
02:20:21,791 --> 02:20:24,410
people are always searching for this,
like really deep hidden meaning.

3026
02:20:24,680 --> 02:20:29,680
But what's really interesting to me is I
don't see that in psychedelic circles.

3027
02:20:30,470 --> 02:20:34,400
One thing that I don't see in 
psychedelic circles is the acceptance of

3028
02:20:34,401 --> 02:20:37,430
Gurus.
Like that's one of the last places where

3029
02:20:37,431 --> 02:20:40,160
I got like deep pockets going to thrive 
because,

3030
02:20:40,280 --> 02:20:42,230
you know,
when you talked to him about Lsd,

3031
02:20:42,231 --> 02:20:44,210
I could achieve these states with my own
mind.

3032
02:20:44,220 --> 02:20:44,540
No,
no,

3033
02:20:44,560 --> 02:20:44,840
no,
no,

3034
02:20:44,910 --> 02:20:45,600
no,
no,

3035
02:20:45,630 --> 02:20:46,320
no.
You can't.

3036
02:20:46,580 --> 02:20:48,150
You know,
I don't think you can.

3037
02:20:48,300 --> 02:20:50,070
And if you can,
if you think you can,

3038
02:20:50,100 --> 02:20:52,200
it's most likely because you haven't 
been there already.

3039
02:20:52,520 --> 02:20:55,200
You know,
if you can achieve dmt without DMT,

3040
02:20:55,230 --> 02:20:57,180
with,
you're a better man than most.

3041
02:20:57,980 --> 02:21:02,980
Some special creature that's studied 
Kundalini Yoga for 10 years and locked 

3042
02:21:02,980 --> 02:21:05,010
herself in a fucking monastery.
Terence Mckenna,

3043
02:21:05,011 --> 02:21:10,011
I believe,
said that LSD was like the most 

3044
02:21:10,011 --> 02:21:10,011
significant molecule of the 20th 
century.

3045
02:21:10,020 --> 02:21:10,730
And so,
you know,

3046
02:21:10,800 --> 02:21:13,410
you can give that to somebody.
Uh,

3047
02:21:13,411 --> 02:21:15,750
if you go on youtube,
you can search for LSD,

3048
02:21:15,751 --> 02:21:17,370
housewife,
19 fifties.

3049
02:21:17,400 --> 02:21:18,270
Oh yeah,
I remember that.

3050
02:21:18,271 --> 02:21:23,271
That's an amazing.
It's an amazing video because this is a 

3051
02:21:23,271 --> 02:21:26,181
woman who,
if you were told you were about to be 

3052
02:21:26,181 --> 02:21:28,611
given LSD,
at least you would know it's about to 

3053
02:21:28,611 --> 02:21:28,611
hit you.
But this is a fucking housewife.

3054
02:21:28,611 --> 02:21:32,800
It's just been sent there to do this 
experiment and he gives her a glass of 

3055
02:21:32,800 --> 02:21:32,800
water.
He's like,

3056
02:21:32,800 --> 02:21:32,800
here you go,
ma'am.

3057
02:21:32,800 --> 02:21:37,701
Here's your Lsd,
and it just hits her and you see this 

3058
02:21:37,701 --> 02:21:41,901
transformation.
It's like you're as one of my friends 

3059
02:21:41,901 --> 02:21:41,901
put it.
It's like you're watching the sixties on

3060
02:21:41,901 --> 02:21:43,400
unfold.
You're watching the 19 fifties transform

3061
02:21:43,401 --> 02:21:48,401
into the sixties to this one woman 
through this one woman and her one LSD 

3062
02:21:48,401 --> 02:21:51,600
experience and a Steve Jobs.
Actually in that biography,

3063
02:21:51,601 --> 02:21:52,680
there's,
like I said earlier,

3064
02:21:52,681 --> 02:21:56,550
there's a lot of stuff like he called 
his era when he grew up,

3065
02:21:56,551 --> 02:22:00,030
a magical time because everybody was 
under the influence of psychedelics.

3066
02:22:00,540 --> 02:22:05,540
Well,
that was the big shift between the 

3067
02:22:05,540 --> 02:22:05,540
fifties and the sixties without a doubt,
and then the seventies,

3068
02:22:05,540 --> 02:22:06,000
the lock it all down.

3069
02:22:06,080 --> 02:22:07,010
Well,
that's what happened.

3070
02:22:07,011 --> 02:22:08,900
They did.
They pass those sweeping,

3071
02:22:09,460 --> 02:22:12,230
the sweeping psychedelics bill,
1970.

3072
02:22:12,290 --> 02:22:14,720
That made.
They made a bunch of stuff illegal.

3073
02:22:14,721 --> 02:22:18,680
That wasn't even psychologic or it 
wasn't even a psychoactive.

3074
02:22:19,030 --> 02:22:24,030
Like there's.
There's different compounds that they 

3075
02:22:24,030 --> 02:22:24,030
made illegal that they don't even affect
the human mind.

3076
02:22:24,030 --> 02:22:28,840
They just.
They're just locking everything down so 

3077
02:22:28,840 --> 02:22:29,100
they're doing stuff without real science
behind it.

3078
02:22:29,770 --> 02:22:32,190
They're not going after the dangerous 
compounds.

3079
02:22:32,191 --> 02:22:37,191
They're just going after anything that 
might alter consciousness in a way that 

3080
02:22:37,191 --> 02:22:40,050
threatens the powers that be,
and that's where they were at.

3081
02:22:40,080 --> 02:22:45,080
They were at this,
we're in this weird place where the 

3082
02:22:45,080 --> 02:22:48,261
world had changed so much in 10 years.
They were terrified as to what the fuck 

3083
02:22:48,261 --> 02:22:48,750
was coming.
The next 10.

3084
02:22:49,080 --> 02:22:53,220
They saw these flower power people and 
all this fucking give peace,

3085
02:22:53,221 --> 02:22:54,810
a chance,
all that shit.

3086
02:22:54,840 --> 02:22:56,520
And they were like,
what is going on here?

3087
02:22:56,521 --> 02:23:01,521
This,
this never even existed in the 19 

3088
02:23:01,521 --> 02:23:01,790
forties when I was growing up.
Here we are in the 19 sixties.

3089
02:23:01,791 --> 02:23:06,791
These God damn hippies and walk them 
through Kent State trying to stop the 

3090
02:23:06,791 --> 02:23:06,791
war.

3091
02:23:06,791 --> 02:23:11,160
What's really kind of scary to think 
about is thinking about how they locked 

3092
02:23:11,291 --> 02:23:16,291
all that stuff down.
People think it's bad because of the 

3093
02:23:16,291 --> 02:23:16,291
conditioning.
You know?

3094
02:23:16,291 --> 02:23:17,170
It's like you don't want to do acid.
You don't want to do weed.

3095
02:23:17,171 --> 02:23:22,171
You don't want to do any of these bad 
sounding things that make you seem like 

3096
02:23:22,171 --> 02:23:22,840
you're kind of on the fringes of 
society.

3097
02:23:23,170 --> 02:23:28,170
So only the people who are on the 
fringes of society start doing these 

3098
02:23:28,170 --> 02:23:32,011
things and you no longer have the 
captains of industry like steve jobs 

3099
02:23:32,011 --> 02:23:36,690
experimenting with this stuff and as a 
result you don't have as much inspiring 

3100
02:23:36,690 --> 02:23:36,700
change.
You know,

3101
02:23:36,701 --> 02:23:40,840
like we've kind of been caught in a Rut 
up until very recently until that whole,

3102
02:23:41,410 --> 02:23:44,380
the whole like Bitcoin Wiki leaks type 
era.

3103
02:23:44,740 --> 02:23:49,740
We were in a span of eight or nine years
where it's like very little personal 

3104
02:23:49,740 --> 02:23:53,251
freedom,
very little dissent or discussion of 

3105
02:23:53,251 --> 02:23:53,251
what's happening.
They're moving.

3106
02:23:53,251 --> 02:23:53,830
So I really think so.
I think after nine slash 11,

3107
02:23:53,831 --> 02:23:57,400
pretty much society went,
if it's not for survival,

3108
02:23:57,670 --> 02:23:59,560
we're going to put it on the back 
burner.

3109
02:23:59,770 --> 02:24:04,770
So we were still doing other stuff,
but now finally we're getting that 

3110
02:24:04,770 --> 02:24:07,330
explosion of creativity and 
experimentation that we were supposed to

3111
02:24:07,331 --> 02:24:12,331
get probably 10 years ago.
And bitcoin is one of those things and 

3112
02:24:12,331 --> 02:24:15,900
like real independent media,
like your show is another one and 

3113
02:24:15,900 --> 02:24:15,900
they're all blossoming.

3114
02:24:15,900 --> 02:24:17,790
I think it was all inevitable.
I really do.

3115
02:24:17,791 --> 02:24:22,791
I mean,
I think and I think quite honestly more 

3116
02:24:22,791 --> 02:24:24,120
people are probably doing psychedelic 
drugs now than have ever before,

3117
02:24:24,121 --> 02:24:26,520
including in the 1970 [inaudible],
the 19 sixties.

3118
02:24:26,910 --> 02:24:28,590
I think the numbers are through the 
roof.

3119
02:24:28,800 --> 02:24:30,810
I think we are caught up in the middle 
of it,

3120
02:24:30,811 --> 02:24:33,180
so we're not totally aware of what's 
going on,

3121
02:24:33,510 --> 02:24:38,510
but if you include marijuana and I 
definitely do when it comes to eating 

3122
02:24:38,510 --> 02:24:42,411
marijuana,
I consider eating marijuana a 

3123
02:24:42,411 --> 02:24:42,411
psychedelic truck.
I really do.

3124
02:24:42,411 --> 02:24:43,470
And I think that people who don't,
they probably,

3125
02:24:43,471 --> 02:24:45,360
they're just probably not eating the 
stuff were eating,

3126
02:24:45,710 --> 02:24:50,710
you know,
the shit that you're getting out of 

3127
02:24:50,710 --> 02:24:50,710
here,
like the gummies,

3128
02:24:50,710 --> 02:24:54,270
the inception moments where you just 
don't feel the same about something 

3129
02:24:54,270 --> 02:24:54,270
again

3130
02:24:54,270 --> 02:24:54,270
ever again.
Yeah.

3131
02:24:54,270 --> 02:24:58,560
Yeah.
Including the very fiber of reality 

3132
02:24:58,560 --> 02:25:01,831
itself.
These God damn things are so powerful 

3133
02:25:01,831 --> 02:25:04,360
and the experience is just not the same 
as smoking it.

3134
02:25:04,420 --> 02:25:07,960
It's way more significant.
It's way deeper and weirder.

3135
02:25:07,961 --> 02:25:12,961
It's just,
it's a different truck when you eat it 

3136
02:25:12,961 --> 02:25:15,300
and it's responsible for a lot of like 
ancient Hindu religious art and 

3137
02:25:15,300 --> 02:25:18,700
religious scriptures.
A lot of that stuff was being done while

3138
02:25:18,701 --> 02:25:19,670
they were eating.
Has She?

3139
02:25:19,671 --> 02:25:20,250
She.
I mean that was,

3140
02:25:20,320 --> 02:25:25,320
that was the,
the preferred method of delivery 

3141
02:25:25,320 --> 02:25:25,450
cannabis for a long time was eating it.

3142
02:25:26,310 --> 02:25:28,980
I think there's,
I think there's a religious high day,

3143
02:25:29,420 --> 02:25:34,420
a high day in India where they just 
smoke all day long to like get in touch 

3144
02:25:34,420 --> 02:25:35,370
with the goddess.
One of the goddesses.

3145
02:25:35,450 --> 02:25:35,780
Yeah.

3146
02:25:36,120 --> 02:25:41,120
I'm sure.
I'm sure there's a lot of religions are 

3147
02:25:41,120 --> 02:25:41,120
like,
that seeks.

3148
02:25:41,120 --> 02:25:43,410
There's certain sex of Sikhs.
They eat this yogurt.

3149
02:25:43,411 --> 02:25:45,780
They were explaining it to Duncan and he
was explaining it to me,

3150
02:25:45,781 --> 02:25:48,060
so I apologize from fucking something 
up.

3151
02:25:48,061 --> 02:25:51,330
But there's some yogurt yogurt that has 
marijuana in it.

3152
02:25:51,990 --> 02:25:56,990
Yeah.
Like the marijuana infused honey or 

3153
02:25:56,990 --> 02:25:59,721
something like that.
And they mix it in this yogurt and get 

3154
02:25:59,721 --> 02:25:59,721
fucking.

3155
02:25:59,721 --> 02:25:59,721
Yeah.

3156
02:25:59,721 --> 02:26:04,420
Blasted.
And these dudes were explaining it to 

3157
02:26:04,420 --> 02:26:04,600
Duncan,
like how important it is to them.

3158
02:26:05,190 --> 02:26:10,190
Sikhs or uh,
an interesting race of people or 

3159
02:26:10,190 --> 02:26:10,190
religious,
a group.

3160
02:26:10,190 --> 02:26:12,200
They get connected to a lot of,
you know,

3161
02:26:12,201 --> 02:26:16,050
ignorantly to like Muslims and Islamic 
people,

3162
02:26:16,051 --> 02:26:21,051
like the people to see things with.
People see things on people's heads and 

3163
02:26:21,051 --> 02:26:22,960
they thing they're all the same folks 
know,

3164
02:26:22,961 --> 02:26:27,730
but ancient religions that had their 
roots in psychedelics,

3165
02:26:27,970 --> 02:26:32,970
there's still a lot of them that are 
around are still a lot of them that 

3166
02:26:32,970 --> 02:26:36,151
exist.
There's a lot of evidence that shows 

3167
02:26:36,151 --> 02:26:36,190
that it's shaped a lot of thinking way,
way,

3168
02:26:36,191 --> 02:26:40,810
way back in the day and if you want to 
get on the that mindset,

3169
02:26:41,470 --> 02:26:46,470
get into the groove that those people 
must have been in when they were doing 

3170
02:26:46,470 --> 02:26:50,431
that.
If you eat hash and think about what it 

3171
02:26:50,431 --> 02:26:53,230
must've been like to live 300 years ago,
I mean you pretty much put yourself in a

3172
02:26:53,231 --> 02:26:58,231
state of mind where you can kind of 
think the way they were thinking a 

3173
02:26:58,231 --> 02:26:59,350
little bit mean.
You can never erase the information that

3174
02:26:59,351 --> 02:27:04,351
you have,
but imagine what it would be like to 

3175
02:27:04,351 --> 02:27:06,280
live two,
3000 years ago and to be eating hash and

3176
02:27:06,281 --> 02:27:11,281
hanging out in India and just tripping 
your fucking balls off on this big round

3177
02:27:11,411 --> 02:27:13,360
ball.
Spinning around in space.

3178
02:27:14,970 --> 02:27:16,970
Illegal.
Yeah.

3179
02:27:16,980 --> 02:27:18,780
I mean I think there's more people doing
that now.

3180
02:27:18,810 --> 02:27:21,540
There's more people eating marijuana now
than probably ever before.

3181
02:27:22,110 --> 02:27:26,220
I think that's pretty safe to say.
The numbers are just staggering.

3182
02:27:26,640 --> 02:27:27,750
You know,
the numbers that are,

3183
02:27:27,750 --> 02:27:27,830
that are

3184
02:27:27,950 --> 02:27:29,750
22 states and the,
uh,

3185
02:27:29,990 --> 02:27:33,050
the territory of Guam now have some kind
of legalization,

3186
02:27:33,051 --> 02:27:35,390
so really,
or medical marijuana laws,

3187
02:27:35,900 --> 02:27:37,910
Washington DC's are going to be a weird 
one.

3188
02:27:38,420 --> 02:27:40,970
I don't know when that goes into effect,
but that passed recently.

3189
02:27:41,120 --> 02:27:44,120
That's going to be weird for sure 
because you can have congressional aides

3190
02:27:44,390 --> 02:27:48,050
go home for lunch hypothetically.
Get high legally come back.

3191
02:27:48,220 --> 02:27:51,380
They'll be tested even if it's still not
federally legal,

3192
02:27:51,381 --> 02:27:54,940
which is hilarious because that's where 
the federal government's offices are.

3193
02:27:55,230 --> 02:27:58,710
So the very state where their offices 
are in Washington DC.

3194
02:27:59,120 --> 02:28:04,120
Well,
the federal government more than 

3195
02:28:04,120 --> 02:28:05,360
anything else that likes money and this 
is one of the most obvious money grabs.

3196
02:28:05,361 --> 02:28:06,510
It's like,
why wouldn't you,

3197
02:28:06,850 --> 02:28:10,190
you know,
we're cutting out all of these where the

3198
02:28:10,191 --> 02:28:15,191
money goes south to the cartels.
If we can keep all that in the United 

3199
02:28:15,191 --> 02:28:15,191
States,
that's a fuck load of money.

3200
02:28:15,191 --> 02:28:19,730
Yeah.
That's one way of looking at it and not 

3201
02:28:19,730 --> 02:28:20,720
just that,
but also small business opportunities.

3202
02:28:20,750 --> 02:28:22,090
Not a lot of startup costs.

3203
02:28:22,110 --> 02:28:24,620
Pretty easy to fucking start your own 
small business selling weed.

3204
02:28:25,030 --> 02:28:29,480
I'm pretty easy to grow it if people 
start transferring that to the,

3205
02:28:29,481 --> 02:28:31,640
uh,
using it as a commodity,

3206
02:28:31,670 --> 02:28:35,450
like the hamp movement that we were 
talking about with clothes and paper and

3207
02:28:35,480 --> 02:28:38,420
building materials and all those things 
start happening.

3208
02:28:38,421 --> 02:28:43,421
If that becomes legal,
it will literally transform this entire 

3209
02:28:43,421 --> 02:28:46,481
country when people find out how easy it
is for farmers to grow hemp and profit 

3210
02:28:47,391 --> 02:28:52,391
off of it.
And we're not talking at all about 

3211
02:28:52,391 --> 02:28:52,391
drugs,
nothing to do with the drug.

3212
02:28:52,391 --> 02:28:56,440
Right now.
It's only legal in a couple states to 

3213
02:28:56,440 --> 02:28:57,680
grow hamp and manufacturer hamp.
And as far as I know,

3214
02:28:58,130 --> 02:29:01,280
it's still not like no one's really 
going for it.

3215
02:29:01,340 --> 02:29:06,340
No big companies are moving in giving it
a shot because it's still federally 

3216
02:29:06,340 --> 02:29:10,121
illegal,
which is weird because not even 

3217
02:29:10,121 --> 02:29:13,030
psychoactive.
Let's have a cousin of the psychoactive 

3218
02:29:13,030 --> 02:29:14,300
strain of marijuana and still illegal.

3219
02:29:16,190 --> 02:29:17,910
It's a,
it's going to end.

3220
02:29:18,140 --> 02:29:20,600
There's no doubt unless something 
happens.

3221
02:29:20,900 --> 02:29:23,210
The only thing that could put the genie 
back in the bottle,

3222
02:29:24,170 --> 02:29:26,300
it would have to be some sort of a 
cataclysmic event,

3223
02:29:26,720 --> 02:29:31,720
whether it's a,
some nuclear bomb goes off or something 

3224
02:29:31,720 --> 02:29:33,620
where they have to completely 19,
84.

3225
02:29:33,621 --> 02:29:37,700
This motherfucker tighten down the 
screws and cut,

3226
02:29:37,820 --> 02:29:40,700
cut off the internet,
filter everything.

3227
02:29:40,760 --> 02:29:43,160
No more drugs,
no more anything.

3228
02:29:43,550 --> 02:29:48,550
I mean they're gonna.
It would have to be something like 

3229
02:29:48,550 --> 02:29:50,210
really huge,
something really huge and scary and even

3230
02:29:50,211 --> 02:29:53,270
then it might not work.
Even then people might be like,

3231
02:29:53,271 --> 02:29:58,271
you know what the reason why this 
fucking nuclear should happen in the 

3232
02:29:58,271 --> 02:29:58,271
first place because we were listening to
you assholes.

3233
02:29:58,271 --> 02:30:02,740
Yeah.
I think that that's more likely is if 

3234
02:30:02,740 --> 02:30:05,171
there was some calamity.
A lot of people just feel like we're 

3235
02:30:05,171 --> 02:30:05,171
going to go do our own thing.

3236
02:30:05,171 --> 02:30:05,690
What do you think of all this ferguson 
protests?

3237
02:30:06,200 --> 02:30:11,200
Do you think that this is just because 
of Ferguson just because that decision 

3238
02:30:11,200 --> 02:30:15,280
or do you think that this is like a sign
that people are ready to start fucking 

3239
02:30:15,280 --> 02:30:17,480
protesting shit because I'm more 
inclined to believe the latter?

3240
02:30:17,510 --> 02:30:22,220
I think there's a lot of resentment in 
the United States over the fact that for

3241
02:30:22,221 --> 02:30:24,440
many of us,
it's hard to find honest work,

3242
02:30:24,530 --> 02:30:26,990
but if you decide to go into law 
enforcement,

3243
02:30:27,380 --> 02:30:29,960
you can suddenly make you a comfortable 
$50,000

3244
02:30:29,961 --> 02:30:33,500
a year and some places just feeding the 
prison system,

3245
02:30:33,501 --> 02:30:36,500
innocent people and that sounds like 
some kind of tree hugger thing,

3246
02:30:36,501 --> 02:30:41,501
but if you look at the math,
that's actually what a lot of these 

3247
02:30:41,501 --> 02:30:43,190
police departments are doing is sending 
poor disadvantaged people.

3248
02:30:43,191 --> 02:30:48,191
Most of the minorities into prison for a
owning things that I don't consider it 

3249
02:30:48,191 --> 02:30:49,160
to be harmful to society.

3250
02:30:49,160 --> 02:30:54,160
You know,
I just don't consider marijuana to be 

3251
02:30:54,160 --> 02:30:56,051
harmful.
And even some of the harder drugs that 

3252
02:30:56,051 --> 02:30:56,051
people get busted on,
it's like,

3253
02:30:56,051 --> 02:31:00,131
well that's.
They're literally their only 

3254
02:31:00,131 --> 02:31:01,871
opportunity,
but that's not what we're talking about 

3255
02:31:01,871 --> 02:31:01,871
here.
We're talking about police brutality,

3256
02:31:01,871 --> 02:31:05,370
but it has nothing to do with distrust,
I believe is connected to the fact that 

3257
02:31:05,900 --> 02:31:10,900
they can't trust these police officers 
because they can ruin your life if they 

3258
02:31:10,900 --> 02:31:12,920
want to over something very arbitrary.
So I think that's the backdrop for it.

3259
02:31:12,950 --> 02:31:17,950
And then,
I don't know all the specifics of 

3260
02:31:17,950 --> 02:31:17,950
Ferguson,
but based on what I saw,

3261
02:31:17,950 --> 02:31:20,070
that grand jury thing there should a 
trial like there are too

3262
02:31:20,070 --> 02:31:25,070
many inconsistencies.
The whole point of a public trial is to 

3263
02:31:25,070 --> 02:31:27,771
figure out what happened and if you're a
police officer and that means somehow 

3264
02:31:27,771 --> 02:31:28,860
you're treated differently.
That to me doesn't add up.

3265
02:31:29,190 --> 02:31:34,190
Well,
I think that when you're dealing with 

3266
02:31:34,190 --> 02:31:38,001
police brutality,
there's a lot better examples than this 

3267
02:31:38,001 --> 02:31:38,001
one.
There's a lot of examples.

3268
02:31:38,001 --> 02:31:41,040
There are absolutely fucking horrific 
that you could find on youtube.

3269
02:31:41,041 --> 02:31:43,380
You can find them everyday.
There's some kid that got tasered.

3270
02:31:43,710 --> 02:31:48,710
He was in his girlfriend's car.
Cop tasered him hit him in near the 

3271
02:31:48,710 --> 02:31:48,990
heart.
He felt it's a white kid,

3272
02:31:48,991 --> 02:31:52,410
fell face planted,
stopped breathing,

3273
02:31:52,680 --> 02:31:57,680
went into cardiac arrest.
They didn't revive him for like three 

3274
02:31:57,680 --> 02:32:01,041
minutes.
He might have brain damage because this 

3275
02:32:01,041 --> 02:32:01,041
kid did nothing,
did nothing wrong.

3276
02:32:01,041 --> 02:32:01,880
It's just sitting in a car.
And the cop told him,

3277
02:32:01,900 --> 02:32:04,350
roll the window down.
Apparently the window didn't roll down.

3278
02:32:04,440 --> 02:32:06,270
Cop fucking tasered him.
I mean,

3279
02:32:06,330 --> 02:32:11,330
I obviously I wasn't there,
but like they show this kid on the 

3280
02:32:11,330 --> 02:32:12,690
ground and the complex standing over,
I'm not doing shit.

3281
02:32:12,691 --> 02:32:17,691
There's a whole video of it.
How about the guy who was in Denver was 

3282
02:32:17,691 --> 02:32:18,630
beating the shit out of this guy they 
had on the ground because he said he had

3283
02:32:18,631 --> 02:32:23,631
a bag in his mouth.
So he's punching him in the face while 

3284
02:32:23,631 --> 02:32:26,240
he's holding him down.
His pregnant wife comes over to try to 

3285
02:32:26,240 --> 02:32:26,240
stop them.
They trip his wife,

3286
02:32:26,240 --> 02:32:27,060
she falls on the ground.
You're watching this.

3287
02:32:27,080 --> 02:32:27,630
You're like,
what?

3288
02:32:27,810 --> 02:32:32,810
Then they tried to erase the video,
but the guy that already uploaded it to 

3289
02:32:32,810 --> 02:32:35,481
the cloud and they released it and 
showed it on television and there's a 

3290
02:32:35,481 --> 02:32:38,580
whole lot of fucking really horrible 
shit that cops do.

3291
02:32:38,970 --> 02:32:43,970
This is,
this is the homepage of reddit every 

3292
02:32:43,970 --> 02:32:43,970
day.

3293
02:32:43,970 --> 02:32:44,520
It's like you see at least one or two 
stories that make your,

3294
02:32:44,880 --> 02:32:49,880
make your heart stop and.
But like many things in this life where 

3295
02:32:50,220 --> 02:32:52,440
you would like things to be completely 
black and white,

3296
02:32:52,620 --> 02:32:57,620
and the thing that people gravitate 
towards turns out to be a massive string

3297
02:32:59,371 --> 02:33:04,371
of contradictions.
There's a lot of things wrong with this 

3298
02:33:04,371 --> 02:33:04,371
case.
The first of all,

3299
02:33:04,371 --> 02:33:04,800
the guy,
first of all,

3300
02:33:04,801 --> 02:33:06,570
he was young.
He was 18 years old.

3301
02:33:07,950 --> 02:33:11,220
Hard to say.
He's responsible for all of his behavior

3302
02:33:11,221 --> 02:33:13,530
at 18 years of age.
When you think about what kind of a life

3303
02:33:13,531 --> 02:33:18,531
this kids live in,
what kind of an environment he's grown 

3304
02:33:18,531 --> 02:33:18,531
up in.
But all that said,

3305
02:33:18,531 --> 02:33:23,510
he's robbing a store.
Just moments before this video of him 

3306
02:33:23,510 --> 02:33:23,580
grabbing this guy by the neck.
He's a fucking huge guy.

3307
02:33:23,850 --> 02:33:26,790
Reaches into the cop's car,
punches him in the face,

3308
02:33:26,791 --> 02:33:30,540
is trying to get the cops gun,
gets shot in the hand at close range.

3309
02:33:30,810 --> 02:33:32,160
All this has been proven.
So you're.

3310
02:33:32,190 --> 02:33:35,630
You're dealing with a dangerous bad guy 
already for sure.

3311
02:33:35,650 --> 02:33:37,100
Has that much been proven?
Yes.

3312
02:33:37,240 --> 02:33:40,170
So we know that he actually,
we know he robbed that store.

3313
02:33:40,260 --> 02:33:42,620
We know he punched the cop.
We know we tried to get the cops gun.

3314
02:33:42,630 --> 02:33:47,630
We know the gun discharged,
he shot him in the hand at very close 

3315
02:33:47,630 --> 02:33:47,630
range.
Well then that if that's the case,

3316
02:33:47,630 --> 02:33:51,020
that doesn't strike me as being the best
example,

3317
02:33:51,021 --> 02:33:53,610
but it's a bad exam.
Still falls under the range of like,

3318
02:33:53,611 --> 02:33:58,611
well,
did you have to end somebody's life or 

3319
02:33:58,611 --> 02:33:58,611
could you have just tackled him?
Well,

3320
02:33:58,611 --> 02:33:58,770
he couldn't tackle them.
First of all,

3321
02:33:58,800 --> 02:34:01,590
he was not physically capable of beating
that kid up or hazed.

3322
02:34:01,990 --> 02:34:02,840
Well,
you know,

3323
02:34:02,870 --> 02:34:04,530
I don't think.
I don't think he had a taser on him,

3324
02:34:04,950 --> 02:34:09,950
but I think that was part of his thing 
and he couldn't discharge pepper spray 

3325
02:34:09,950 --> 02:34:13,371
because he was in the car and the guy's 
punched him in the face and he was 

3326
02:34:13,371 --> 02:34:13,770
worried he was gonna lose consciousness 
and it's a big fucking kid.

3327
02:34:15,140 --> 02:34:20,140
So there's better examples.
I don't know what the fuck happened in 

3328
02:34:20,140 --> 02:34:23,251
the moments before that guy's life was 
taken and there's contradicting stories.

3329
02:34:23,771 --> 02:34:26,200
There's people that say that he had his 
hands up,

3330
02:34:26,340 --> 02:34:29,620
those people that say he was charging,
you know when you have that.

3331
02:34:29,621 --> 02:34:31,630
I don't know what the fucking tell you.
I mean,

3332
02:34:31,650 --> 02:34:34,990
I don't understand people that claim 
they do know.

3333
02:34:35,320 --> 02:34:40,320
When you look at the autopsy,
the autopsy statements apparently tend 

3334
02:34:40,320 --> 02:34:44,020
to tend to exonerate the cop,
the autopsy,

3335
02:34:44,590 --> 02:34:49,060
the descriptions of the bullet wounds 
are supposedly,

3336
02:34:49,270 --> 02:34:54,270
from what I've read,
obviously I'm not a forensic scientist 

3337
02:34:54,270 --> 02:34:55,140
or anything,
but they seemed to indicate this.

3338
02:34:55,160 --> 02:35:00,160
The cop story was a little bit more 
kosher that he had a shot on the top of 

3339
02:35:00,160 --> 02:35:03,451
his head,
which he indicated was charging towards 

3340
02:35:03,451 --> 02:35:05,391
him,
shot through his arm in a way that you 

3341
02:35:05,391 --> 02:35:05,391
couldn't possibly do if the guy's arms 
are up in the air.

3342
02:35:05,391 --> 02:35:07,180
Like everybody's saying,
I don't know.

3343
02:35:07,660 --> 02:35:12,660
I don't know what the fuck happened.
There's people that say they saw him 

3344
02:35:12,660 --> 02:35:15,031
with his hands up.
Then the other thing that's a real 

3345
02:35:15,031 --> 02:35:17,401
problem is witness testimony.
People see things that aren't really 

3346
02:35:17,401 --> 02:35:17,401
there.

3347
02:35:17,401 --> 02:35:20,670
One,
one of the women on the grand jury,

3348
02:35:20,671 --> 02:35:22,850
the AP story said that,
uh,

3349
02:35:22,860 --> 02:35:27,860
she has racist views,
has trouble differentiating between 

3350
02:35:27,860 --> 02:35:29,220
truth and things.
She is read online,

3351
02:35:29,730 --> 02:35:31,230
and this is actually in the AP report.
You're like,

3352
02:35:31,231 --> 02:35:32,250
well,
if this is a person,

3353
02:35:32,280 --> 02:35:37,280
he's one of your witnesses.
That's pretty flimsy witness right 

3354
02:35:37,280 --> 02:35:37,280
there.
You know,

3355
02:35:37,280 --> 02:35:39,230
there's an interesting radio lab story 
this month,

3356
02:35:39,950 --> 02:35:44,950
this week rather.
Radio lab is a really interesting 

3357
02:35:44,950 --> 02:35:46,250
podcast that I listened to and this one 
is about a,

3358
02:35:47,110 --> 02:35:51,920
I think it was in Mumbai or Kenya,
I forget what part of Africa it was,

3359
02:35:52,220 --> 02:35:57,220
but there was a terrorist attack on a 
mall and these guys showed up with guns 

3360
02:35:58,401 --> 02:36:01,640
and they shot a bunch of people and 
there was all these different eyewitness

3361
02:36:01,641 --> 02:36:06,641
testimonies that were just.
It was hard to figure out who's telling 

3362
02:36:06,641 --> 02:36:07,580
the truth.
There was 15 gunman.

3363
02:36:07,581 --> 02:36:09,620
There was 10 gunman.
Well,

3364
02:36:09,740 --> 02:36:14,740
they did a forensic examination of all 
of the video footage from all the 

3365
02:36:14,740 --> 02:36:15,950
surveillance cameras and turns out 
there,

3366
02:36:15,980 --> 02:36:20,980
four gunman and they were all killed and
these people had these different 

3367
02:36:21,051 --> 02:36:25,160
descriptions and they like swore they 
saw this and they swore they saw that.

3368
02:36:25,730 --> 02:36:29,420
But when you go over all the video 
footage from all the people entering,

3369
02:36:29,421 --> 02:36:31,720
all the people leaving,
all the they.

3370
02:36:31,880 --> 02:36:36,470
They have this pretty accurate based on 
like real hard evidence.

3371
02:36:36,590 --> 02:36:39,920
They've got a 24 hour camera system 
going all the time.

3372
02:36:39,921 --> 02:36:44,921
They captured all of it and they spent 
hours and hours going over all the 

3373
02:36:44,921 --> 02:36:47,030
events and finding out who's the WHO's 
the shooter.

3374
02:36:47,060 --> 02:36:52,060
I mean they have a.
They have a grid of the entire place so 

3375
02:36:52,060 --> 02:36:55,091
they know what happened,
but yet people have all these different 

3376
02:36:55,091 --> 02:36:56,570
descriptions of young people,
of older people,

3377
02:36:56,571 --> 02:36:59,300
people taking off their clothes and 
assimilating into society.

3378
02:36:59,420 --> 02:37:02,060
They drop their gun and change their 
clothes and they they,

3379
02:37:02,250 --> 02:37:07,250
they escaped like a normal person and 
that became a narrative and there was a 

3380
02:37:07,250 --> 02:37:07,280
lot of people that believe these 
stories,

3381
02:37:07,550 --> 02:37:12,550
but when they describe the actual events
that they've captured on video to these 

3382
02:37:13,761 --> 02:37:15,290
people,
they don't want to it.

3383
02:37:15,530 --> 02:37:20,530
They don't want to admit what what is 
actually on video you could see 

3384
02:37:20,530 --> 02:37:20,530
happening.

3385
02:37:20,530 --> 02:37:20,960
That's not what I saw.
That's not what I saw,

3386
02:37:20,961 --> 02:37:23,660
but it's all right there.
People see things,

3387
02:37:23,900 --> 02:37:26,630
especially under stress,
stressful situation,

3388
02:37:26,660 --> 02:37:29,960
a murder taking place and attack on a 
police officer.

3389
02:37:30,170 --> 02:37:31,940
Guns are going off.
Oh my God,

3390
02:37:31,941 --> 02:37:33,200
the guy got shot.
Did you see what happened?

3391
02:37:33,201 --> 02:37:34,760
I saw it.
He had his hands up.

3392
02:37:34,910 --> 02:37:36,710
He had his hands up.
I saw him too.

3393
02:37:36,730 --> 02:37:39,170
He had his hands up and then people 
start repeating it,

3394
02:37:39,410 --> 02:37:40,790
hands up,
don't shoot like,

3395
02:37:40,791 --> 02:37:41,900
okay.
He had his hands up.

3396
02:37:42,170 --> 02:37:44,660
I don't know if he had his hands up.
He might've had his hands up,

3397
02:37:45,050 --> 02:37:46,160
but to say,
you know,

3398
02:37:46,161 --> 02:37:48,260
he didn't have his hands up or to say,
you know,

3399
02:37:48,261 --> 02:37:49,790
he had his hands up.
It's fucking crazy.

3400
02:37:49,791 --> 02:37:51,710
Unless you were there and if you were 
there,

3401
02:37:51,711 --> 02:37:52,430
man,
I wouldn't have to.

3402
02:37:52,680 --> 02:37:56,110
I say I'd have to know.
You need this body camera stuff is going

3403
02:37:56,111 --> 02:37:56,990
to solve a lot of problems.

3404
02:37:57,430 --> 02:38:00,080
Yeah.
We'll find an honest cop.

3405
02:38:00,081 --> 02:38:05,081
That should be the first thing you want 
because it means your liabilities now 

3406
02:38:05,081 --> 02:38:05,480
dropping the close to zero.
If you,

3407
02:38:05,510 --> 02:38:08,510
if you take somebody's life and it turns
out it was justified or you use,

3408
02:38:08,540 --> 02:38:10,190
you know,
use of force and you need to.

3409
02:38:10,850 --> 02:38:12,350
Any jury is going to look at that and 
go,

3410
02:38:12,351 --> 02:38:15,230
well you're a cop and you're protecting 
the public and a story.

3411
02:38:15,380 --> 02:38:20,380
No doubt.
And I think ultimately that's going to 

3412
02:38:20,380 --> 02:38:22,601
be the great response to all this shit.
All these horrible situations,

3413
02:38:23,031 --> 02:38:28,031
like the 12 year old kid that was killed
with the fake gun that was just walking 

3414
02:38:28,031 --> 02:38:31,511
on the street,
the cops pull up within two seconds of 

3415
02:38:31,511 --> 02:38:31,511
getting out of their car.
This kid's dead.

3416
02:38:31,511 --> 02:38:32,840
They get out of the car,
they just start shooting them,

3417
02:38:33,260 --> 02:38:38,260
you know,
and the nine one one call says it looks 

3418
02:38:38,260 --> 02:38:38,260
like he's got a fake gun.

3419
02:38:38,260 --> 02:38:39,800
The nine one one call says that.
I mean,

3420
02:38:39,801 --> 02:38:42,530
I don't know what the fuck information 
gets the actual cops itself,

3421
02:38:42,710 --> 02:38:47,710
you know,
the nine slash 11 operator calls the 

3422
02:38:47,710 --> 02:38:47,710
cops and say,
Hey,

3423
02:38:47,710 --> 02:38:50,291
there's a guy with a gun.
I don't know what the fuck was actually 

3424
02:38:50,291 --> 02:38:52,601
said,
but there's a lot of those situations 

3425
02:38:52,601 --> 02:38:55,661
and a lot of those situations just 
simply wouldn't take place the same way 

3426
02:38:55,661 --> 02:38:56,960
if everyone was wearing cameras.
They just wouldn't,

3427
02:38:57,680 --> 02:38:59,270
they wouldn't.
There'd be accountability.

3428
02:38:59,990 --> 02:39:04,990
I mean cameras on cops.
That's like the Internet of law 

3429
02:39:04,990 --> 02:39:04,990
enforcement,
you know?

3430
02:39:04,990 --> 02:39:07,190
That's really what it is.
It's like full accountability,

3431
02:39:07,280 --> 02:39:10,490
full access to information and if those 
fucking things are streaming,

3432
02:39:11,210 --> 02:39:14,720
first of all,
what an amazing show that would be.

3433
02:39:14,870 --> 02:39:19,870
He'd build a watch cops lives like all 
day long and just stream into officer 

3434
02:39:19,870 --> 02:39:24,041
Wilson's camera.
The Truman show meets cops like you 

3435
02:39:24,041 --> 02:39:24,320
think about that.

3436
02:39:24,320 --> 02:39:29,320
Like guys in Compton,
like like working the beat in Inglewood,

3437
02:39:29,720 --> 02:39:34,720
you know,
at night doing drug law enforcement or 

3438
02:39:34,720 --> 02:39:39,160
narcotics.
What'll happen is within a few years 

3439
02:39:39,160 --> 02:39:40,070
you'll be watching it and one of the 
cops will take down some meth dealer and

3440
02:39:40,071 --> 02:39:41,000
you'll be like,
good job.

3441
02:39:41,330 --> 02:39:46,330
The qr code will pop up on the screen.
Everybody will send him like a little 

3442
02:39:46,330 --> 02:39:49,871
bit of Bitcoin.
That cop will be set for the year and 

3443
02:39:49,871 --> 02:39:51,860
it'll become this thing where it's like 
you want to be a really fair cop because

3444
02:39:51,861 --> 02:39:56,861
everybody's watching the streams for fun
and providing tips to the cops that are 

3445
02:39:56,861 --> 02:39:58,550
not corrupt.
The monetary 10 he'd be right.

3446
02:39:59,030 --> 02:40:00,950
I mean this has maybe like a one percent
chance of happening,

3447
02:40:00,951 --> 02:40:02,450
but I think it'd be cool.
Well,

3448
02:40:02,451 --> 02:40:03,890
one thing that would be cool as you 
would know,

3449
02:40:03,891 --> 02:40:08,670
like cops that are cool you would know 
like who gets people you know,

3450
02:40:08,700 --> 02:40:13,010
gives people fair deals and communicates
with people well and doesn't,

3451
02:40:13,050 --> 02:40:14,310
doesn't abuse his power.

3452
02:40:14,410 --> 02:40:19,410
Well,
I will say like every interaction I've 

3453
02:40:19,410 --> 02:40:21,391
had with a cop in California has been 
positive and I think part of that is it 

3454
02:40:21,391 --> 02:40:22,450
in the back of my brain.
I'm not like,

3455
02:40:22,451 --> 02:40:27,451
oh,
this guy could fuck me over if you 

3456
02:40:27,451 --> 02:40:27,451
wanted to because I had weed in my car.
Now it's like,

3457
02:40:27,451 --> 02:40:29,850
well I'm doing everything that's legal 
and he's doing his stuff and like,

3458
02:40:29,950 --> 02:40:30,760
cool,
you know,

3459
02:40:31,080 --> 02:40:34,030
and you're white and um,
white,

3460
02:40:34,790 --> 02:40:35,360
white.

3461
02:40:37,060 --> 02:40:40,420
Not at all denying the a racialist white
privilege,

3462
02:40:40,480 --> 02:40:43,210
the racial profiling that happens with 
cops.

3463
02:40:43,211 --> 02:40:48,211
But all I'm saying is living in a state 
where I'm not treated like a criminal 

3464
02:40:48,211 --> 02:40:50,500
for doing things that as an adult I feel
I should be entitled to do that.

3465
02:40:50,501 --> 02:40:51,580
Or you know,
in my own,

3466
02:40:52,090 --> 02:40:54,790
just an antidepressant basically.
Why shouldn't I be allowed to do that?

3467
02:40:55,510 --> 02:41:00,510
The cops here,
we agree it's none of our business and 

3468
02:41:00,510 --> 02:41:00,510
that to me is a sign of respect,
so I respect them.

3469
02:41:01,120 --> 02:41:06,120
Well,
cops in California definitely have a 

3470
02:41:06,120 --> 02:41:06,120
different take on it,
but it's come a long way.

3471
02:41:06,120 --> 02:41:10,090
You know,
I have a buddy of mine is a cop like 

3472
02:41:10,090 --> 02:41:10,120
years ago would joke around about how he
doesn't care.

3473
02:41:10,550 --> 02:41:14,310
Marijuana was still fucking arrest them.
Why?

3474
02:41:14,311 --> 02:41:15,870
What's wrong with you?
But they,

3475
02:41:15,871 --> 02:41:20,871
you know,
they get into that US versus them 

3476
02:41:20,871 --> 02:41:23,241
mentality I think.
I don't think we realized how difficult 

3477
02:41:23,241 --> 02:41:26,480
it is to be a cop.
I think fucking unbelievably hard jobs.

3478
02:41:26,481 --> 02:41:29,970
And you're the scum of the earth like 
sometimes part of the time.

3479
02:41:30,030 --> 02:41:30,620
Yeah.
Well you're,

3480
02:41:30,621 --> 02:41:33,570
you're also dealing with incredible 
amounts of pressure.

3481
02:41:33,650 --> 02:41:35,800
You're dealing with incredible amounts 
of,

3482
02:41:36,100 --> 02:41:37,920
of,
of violent input.

3483
02:41:37,921 --> 02:41:41,310
You're seeing things that you can't 
unsee it and you're looking at people in

3484
02:41:41,311 --> 02:41:44,160
a completely different way if you work 
in a nightclub.

3485
02:41:44,400 --> 02:41:49,400
Okay.
Like say if your only interaction with 

3486
02:41:49,400 --> 02:41:49,400
people's.
You're a bartender and nightclub,

3487
02:41:49,400 --> 02:41:50,100
you would think that everybody is a 
drunk asshole.

3488
02:41:50,220 --> 02:41:52,650
Just maniacs.
You know,

3489
02:41:52,651 --> 02:41:57,651
if you're a woman who has to wear like a
short leather skirt and show up at a 

3490
02:41:57,651 --> 02:41:58,890
fucking honky tonk bar and delivered 
drinks,

3491
02:41:59,490 --> 02:42:04,490
your opinion of men is going to be based
on drunks that you see at night in the 

3492
02:42:04,490 --> 02:42:09,141
dark who are grabbing ass,
act like assholes and spilling shit on 

3493
02:42:09,141 --> 02:42:10,470
themselves and then driving home drunk.

3494
02:42:10,470 --> 02:42:11,040
He'd be like,
Oh,

3495
02:42:11,041 --> 02:42:16,041
they're disgusting.
But if you were a chick who worked the 

3496
02:42:16,171 --> 02:42:19,380
front desk at a yoga place,
you might meet like really cool,

3497
02:42:19,381 --> 02:42:20,920
peaceful people.
You know.

3498
02:42:20,930 --> 02:42:23,460
It's all about the environment that you 
find yourself in.

3499
02:42:23,980 --> 02:42:28,980
And if you're,
you're in the environment of being a 

3500
02:42:28,980 --> 02:42:29,820
police officer.
Most of what you're dealing with all day

3501
02:42:29,850 --> 02:42:34,850
is people that are breaking the law and 
conflict and people running away and 

3502
02:42:34,850 --> 02:42:35,850
fuck man,
that,

3503
02:42:36,240 --> 02:42:39,000
that job is fucking hard.
It's hard.

3504
02:42:39,300 --> 02:42:42,330
I mean,
you don't just start punching immigrants

3505
02:42:42,331 --> 02:42:44,250
in the face on your first day.
You know,

3506
02:42:44,251 --> 02:42:49,251
you don't like tackle a guy and start 
punched in the face because you got a 

3507
02:42:49,251 --> 02:42:52,191
heroin bag in his mouth.
That's like years and years of stress 

3508
02:42:52,191 --> 02:42:57,081
and and build up and just fucking 
craziness had barely keeping it together

3509
02:42:58,111 --> 02:43:03,111
and who knows what you're on.
Who knows if you're on antidepressants 

3510
02:43:03,111 --> 02:43:05,950
or anti this or pro that or adderall.

3511
02:43:05,950 --> 02:43:10,950
A lot of them take adderall to try to 
stay awake and stay sharp and provigils 

3512
02:43:10,950 --> 02:43:15,831
a big one.
The cops are taking that new vigil and 

3513
02:43:15,831 --> 02:43:18,751
pro vigil.
A lot of police officers like that shit 

3514
02:43:18,751 --> 02:43:19,990
because it keeps them sharp and a lot of
them are on steroids.

3515
02:43:20,030 --> 02:43:25,030
Lot of on steroids now.
I don't think they're doing a lot of 

3516
02:43:25,030 --> 02:43:25,120
tests for steroids and the fucking 
police department.

3517
02:43:25,121 --> 02:43:26,890
I saw this dude pull this guy over the 
other day.

3518
02:43:26,891 --> 02:43:29,510
He was Jack,
Jack,

3519
02:43:30,010 --> 02:43:33,170
Jack State troopers here.
Don't fuck around so big.

3520
02:43:33,310 --> 02:43:34,750
The guy was so jacked.
He was.

3521
02:43:34,930 --> 02:43:38,320
He was that level of jacked where you 
just don't get there without drugs,

3522
02:43:38,680 --> 02:43:41,080
just like arms are like three times as 
big as mine.

3523
02:43:41,110 --> 02:43:43,630
Giant ass fucking neck.
It was huge.

3524
02:43:43,760 --> 02:43:47,050
It was huge and I was like,
this guy is a drug user.

3525
02:43:47,200 --> 02:43:52,200
He's a drug user and he's using illegal 
drugs and he's pulling people over like 

3526
02:43:52,240 --> 02:43:55,270
unless he's doing testosterone 
replacement therapy and just like,

3527
02:43:55,900 --> 02:43:58,120
at the very least he's abusing his 
levels.

3528
02:43:58,150 --> 02:43:59,830
I mean,
the guy's gigantic.

3529
02:43:59,900 --> 02:44:02,650
It's so preposterous.
Leave large.

3530
02:44:03,160 --> 02:44:04,200
That's a cop.
Nobody,

3531
02:44:04,230 --> 02:44:07,240
nobody has a problem with that big ass 
fucking arms and its sleeve.

3532
02:44:08,500 --> 02:44:10,210
Nobody has a problem.
That's okay.

3533
02:44:10,780 --> 02:44:13,840
That's okay because it got a roach in 
your fucking car salesman get out of the

3534
02:44:13,850 --> 02:44:14,520
car,
son.

3535
02:44:14,640 --> 02:44:16,290
That's what I'm talking about.
Like it's that,

3536
02:44:16,860 --> 02:44:17,940
that kind of,
uh,

3537
02:44:19,350 --> 02:44:24,350
that uh,
opposition just puts you in a kind of 

3538
02:44:24,350 --> 02:44:24,350
freaked out mode.
Yeah.

3539
02:44:24,750 --> 02:44:25,410
Yeah,
it does.

3540
02:44:25,500 --> 02:44:30,500
Even in New York,
which most of us can we consider New 

3541
02:44:30,500 --> 02:44:32,200
York to be a civilized city.
It's like the cultural capital of the US

3542
02:44:32,220 --> 02:44:34,380
in some ways.
If you're black,

3543
02:44:34,381 --> 02:44:36,840
the stop and frisk thing,
that's an expensive,

3544
02:44:36,841 --> 02:44:40,380
like unpleasant process.
I believe that discontinued that.

3545
02:44:40,410 --> 02:44:41,890
I think they will.
Um,

3546
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:45,390
wasn't a ruled unconstitutional.
I don't 100 percent know what the status

3547
02:44:45,391 --> 02:44:48,060
of that is.
We'll pull up stop and frisk,

3548
02:44:48,270 --> 02:44:50,580
but that went on for years and that was 
complete bullshit.

3549
02:44:50,600 --> 02:44:50,990
Yeah.

3550
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:53,180
Yeah,
um,

3551
02:44:54,010 --> 02:44:56,760
stop and Frisk,
um,

3552
02:45:00,920 --> 02:45:04,670
mayor says New York City will settle 
suits on stop and frisk.

3553
02:45:05,850 --> 02:45:06,220
Hm.

3554
02:45:08,400 --> 02:45:10,740
Stop and Frisk.
Appeal is on hold.

3555
02:45:11,310 --> 02:45:12,900
Okay.
This is the latest here.

3556
02:45:13,240 --> 02:45:14,350
New York City ends,
legal,

3557
02:45:14,370 --> 02:45:16,950
defensive stop and Frisk.
So apparently they just.

3558
02:45:16,951 --> 02:45:19,290
So they had dropped the appeal.
Okay.

3559
02:45:19,440 --> 02:45:22,230
So what it is is apparently there's like
so much,

3560
02:45:23,280 --> 02:45:28,280
so many lawsuits and so much bullshit 
attached to it that they're probably 

3561
02:45:28,280 --> 02:45:28,470
doing it for financial reasons.

3562
02:45:29,610 --> 02:45:30,660
Well,
that's like California.

3563
02:45:30,661 --> 02:45:32,010
We're letting go of the,
uh,

3564
02:45:32,130 --> 02:45:33,690
nonviolent drug offenders,
right?

3565
02:45:34,080 --> 02:45:36,250
That proposition that passed.
Yeah.

3566
02:45:36,840 --> 02:45:40,140
That's the money move to.
That has nothing to do with morality.

3567
02:45:40,141 --> 02:45:43,380
It's like we don't have the money to 
fucking spend $60,000

3568
02:45:43,381 --> 02:45:45,630
for every single person we lock up.
Yeah.

3569
02:45:46,600 --> 02:45:47,760
The New York City,
they're,

3570
02:45:47,770 --> 02:45:52,770
they're saying mayor Bloomberg's 
administration has sought the appeal to 

3571
02:45:52,770 --> 02:45:57,231
appeal Judge Korea Shin,
the Lynn Lynn's ruling,

3572
02:45:59,280 --> 02:46:02,790
which stated that the New York City 
Police Department had abused its power,

3573
02:46:03,210 --> 02:46:06,930
but a de Blasio is working to settle the
case out of court.

3574
02:46:06,931 --> 02:46:08,970
We believe these steps will make 
everyone safer.

3575
02:46:09,290 --> 02:46:09,950
Blasio told

3576
02:46:10,220 --> 02:46:15,220
New York Brooklyn news conference,
this will be one city where everyone 

3577
02:46:16,491 --> 02:46:19,460
rises together where everyone's rights 
are protected.

3578
02:46:19,630 --> 02:46:21,180
Okay,
sure.

3579
02:46:21,200 --> 02:46:23,150
What that means.
Everyone rises together.

3580
02:46:23,630 --> 02:46:25,730
So his cane,
he campaigned,

3581
02:46:25,790 --> 02:46:30,790
the new mayor,
mayor de blasio campaigned on a promise 

3582
02:46:30,790 --> 02:46:31,490
to end the era of stop and Frisk.
Policing.

3583
02:46:33,020 --> 02:46:34,460
Yeah,
I mean it's gross.

3584
02:46:34,550 --> 02:46:36,560
It's gross in.
Especially if you're a young black guy.

3585
02:46:36,561 --> 02:46:38,160
It's horseshit or young.
I mean,

3586
02:46:38,310 --> 02:46:41,330
I don't know if women are getting 
harassed as much.

3587
02:46:42,060 --> 02:46:47,060
They're saying men,
they're saying young African American 

3588
02:46:47,060 --> 02:46:49,931
and Latino men in specific.
It's horrible to be treated as a 

3589
02:46:49,931 --> 02:46:49,931
criminal.
You're not doing anything wrong.

3590
02:46:49,931 --> 02:46:50,650
Yeah.
That's gross.

3591
02:46:50,720 --> 02:46:52,040
Well,
about the guy that was walking there was

3592
02:46:52,041 --> 02:46:54,650
just putting his hands in his pockets 
and this is a.

3593
02:46:55,700 --> 02:46:57,530
that's where we're at.
That's our world.

3594
02:46:58,340 --> 02:47:01,010
No judging people based on how many,
how much melanin,

3595
02:47:01,340 --> 02:47:06,340
what,
what part of the world your parents 

3596
02:47:06,340 --> 02:47:06,340
might have immigrated from.

3597
02:47:06,340 --> 02:47:06,340
That's part.
That's part of the world.

3598
02:47:06,340 --> 02:47:10,781
No,
we have a big part of the country where 

3599
02:47:10,781 --> 02:47:10,781
you can,
at least in Colorado,

3600
02:47:10,781 --> 02:47:15,581
just walk into a gift shop and get what 
you need to feel happy and nobody's 

3601
02:47:15,581 --> 02:47:18,620
gonna racially profile you and fuck up 
your life and that's awesome.

3602
02:47:18,621 --> 02:47:19,970
You know,
we should have more stuff like that.

3603
02:47:20,180 --> 02:47:22,090
But in Colorado that's where that 
fucking.

3604
02:47:22,110 --> 02:47:27,110
I got beaten up.
Denver Police Department beat the fuck 

3605
02:47:27,110 --> 02:47:27,110
out of that guy.
What a heroin bag in his mouth,

3606
02:47:27,110 --> 02:47:30,340
so they'll just escalating other drugs.
Is that the thing now?

3607
02:47:30,390 --> 02:47:31,330
Now it's going to be like,
well,

3608
02:47:31,340 --> 02:47:33,920
if you have any of these,
we're really going to come after you,

3609
02:47:33,921 --> 02:47:35,900
but this one's okay.
Maybe mean.

3610
02:47:35,960 --> 02:47:38,570
What do they do?
If they have drug quotas,

3611
02:47:38,600 --> 02:47:43,600
that's the real issue.
Because of a department had quotas on 

3612
02:47:43,600 --> 02:47:45,020
arrests and some of them do and they're 
very controversial.

3613
02:47:45,020 --> 02:47:49,040
There's quotas on speeding tickets as 
quotas and all sorts of things that cops

3614
02:47:49,041 --> 02:47:54,041
are told they have to reach.
I've always wondered what the fuck 

3615
02:47:54,041 --> 02:47:54,440
happens.
If no one commits a crime,

3616
02:47:54,650 --> 02:47:57,350
what happens if we all agree like,
hey everybody,

3617
02:47:57,680 --> 02:47:59,510
can we all keep it together for six 
months?

3618
02:47:59,511 --> 02:48:04,511
Because if everybody can keep it 
together for six months and we all make 

3619
02:48:04,511 --> 02:48:04,550
a pact that no one speeds,
no one litters,

3620
02:48:04,700 --> 02:48:06,620
no one does anything.
The cops can arrest you for.

3621
02:48:06,800 --> 02:48:10,640
No one breaks a law for six months.
What the fuck did the cops do?

3622
02:48:10,970 --> 02:48:12,260
Like what do we do?
Does.

3623
02:48:12,261 --> 02:48:17,261
I mean if we can do that for a day,
if we could use just fred day police 

3624
02:48:17,271 --> 02:48:19,460
departments across the United States 
would fucking panic.

3625
02:48:19,461 --> 02:48:23,330
We nail arrested as to create new laws.
If you're an oxygen smuggler,

3626
02:48:24,790 --> 02:48:26,960
you breathe too much oxygen,
we got to take you down.

3627
02:48:27,020 --> 02:48:28,250
Well,
you know what they would likely do?

3628
02:48:28,280 --> 02:48:33,050
They'd probably likely get people to 
conspire to do something.

3629
02:48:33,160 --> 02:48:38,160
They would go undercover and then create
crime and arrest people for agreeing 

3630
02:48:38,160 --> 02:48:38,800
with them.
Like,

3631
02:48:38,840 --> 02:48:43,840
we're going to go rob that bank.
I guarantee you we could make some 

3632
02:48:43,840 --> 02:48:43,840
money.
Yeah,

3633
02:48:43,840 --> 02:48:43,840
man,
you want to rob that bank makes money.

3634
02:48:43,840 --> 02:48:44,420
I'm in.
As long as you're show,

3635
02:48:44,421 --> 02:48:46,610
we can make some money.
I'm sure we can make some money.

3636
02:48:46,760 --> 02:48:48,650
And they set it all up and then the.
All right,

3637
02:48:48,980 --> 02:48:50,870
everybody put your hands up.
You're going to rob this bank,

3638
02:48:51,270 --> 02:48:52,970
use your fucking idea,
man.

3639
02:48:53,180 --> 02:48:58,180
Like that right now is legal and that 
right now is how they bust people for 

3640
02:48:58,180 --> 02:48:58,760
drugs.
They do it all the time.

3641
02:48:59,060 --> 02:49:02,630
They bust people for drugs where they 
have fake drug deals,

3642
02:49:02,750 --> 02:49:07,750
where they put people in jail for 
significant amounts of time for drugs 

3643
02:49:07,750 --> 02:49:08,220
that never existed.
They thought

3644
02:49:08,220 --> 02:49:09,690
they were going to buy and sell these 
drugs.

3645
02:49:09,691 --> 02:49:12,120
They get them on conspiracy to buy and 
sell drugs.

3646
02:49:12,121 --> 02:49:17,121
They believe they're real drugs,
but the drugs are just a fiction of the 

3647
02:49:17,121 --> 02:49:18,870
dea is imagination and a big part of the
theater that's been put on.

3648
02:49:19,170 --> 02:49:24,170
They do it with terrorism.
That mentally challenged guy that they 

3649
02:49:24,170 --> 02:49:28,221
arrested a few years back in Dallas was 
a perfect example that they gave this 

3650
02:49:28,221 --> 02:49:29,520
guy a fake bomb.
Set it up,

3651
02:49:29,521 --> 02:49:34,521
convinced him that you're gonna,
take this bomb and you're going to 

3652
02:49:34,521 --> 02:49:37,020
fucking blow this building up and the 
name of a law and they got this mentally

3653
02:49:37,021 --> 02:49:38,910
challenged guy,
set him up,

3654
02:49:39,450 --> 02:49:41,580
got him to do it,
talked him into it,

3655
02:49:41,670 --> 02:49:44,640
gave him the fake bomb,
and then when he went to detonate it,

3656
02:49:44,641 --> 02:49:45,210
they arrested him.

3657
02:49:45,810 --> 02:49:49,440
But to play,
play devil's advocate to play a national

3658
02:49:49,441 --> 02:49:53,310
security state advocate and be the 
homelands type character.

3659
02:49:54,270 --> 02:49:57,660
That kind of person who that dumb or 
that easily influenced,

3660
02:49:58,080 --> 02:50:01,170
they're going to bounce around and come 
up against something ugly at some point.

3661
02:50:01,171 --> 02:50:03,270
So yeah,
I mean there's,

3662
02:50:03,300 --> 02:50:08,300
there's a fine line with entrapment.
Like I think that they should be doing 

3663
02:50:08,300 --> 02:50:11,361
some of those undercover sting things 
because that's how you find out who is 

3664
02:50:11,361 --> 02:50:14,961
the bad guy.
And like any normal person would be 

3665
02:50:14,961 --> 02:50:14,961
like,
no,

3666
02:50:14,961 --> 02:50:17,781
I'm good.
I'm not going to take the bombs and go 

3667
02:50:17,781 --> 02:50:17,781
do the thing.
Right.

3668
02:50:17,781 --> 02:50:17,880
That's like,
that's the choice the person makes.

3669
02:50:18,240 --> 02:50:23,240
And uh,
that's one of those areas where I think 

3670
02:50:23,240 --> 02:50:24,360
some of it is going over the line,
but I think they have to do that too.

3671
02:50:24,840 --> 02:50:29,840
Well,
I think the idea of the wounded 

3672
02:50:29,840 --> 02:50:32,751
antelope,
it's better to take them out quickly 

3673
02:50:32,751 --> 02:50:32,810
before the crocodiles get them at the 
waterhole.

3674
02:50:33,010 --> 02:50:34,170
There's some merit to that.

3675
02:50:34,240 --> 02:50:34,980
Yeah,
that's what I'm saying.

3676
02:50:34,981 --> 02:50:38,220
Like,
this is a dumb guy whose mind is fertile

3677
02:50:38,221 --> 02:50:43,221
for radicalism,
know it's better to get the fake 

3678
02:50:43,221 --> 02:50:43,221
radicalism than the real thing,

3679
02:50:43,221 --> 02:50:46,220
or figure out a way to let this poor 
bastard no,

3680
02:50:46,221 --> 02:50:51,221
that he's stupid and don't listen to 
everybody because they're going to try 

3681
02:50:51,221 --> 02:50:51,221
to get you to blow up a building and 
they gonna lock you in a fucking cage.

3682
02:50:51,221 --> 02:50:53,120
I mean that guy right now than a jail 
somewhere.

3683
02:50:53,180 --> 02:50:58,180
And he probably will remain that chill 
for a long fucking time and there's not 

3684
02:50:58,180 --> 02:51:02,351
a lot of recourse.
And he probably was super excited about 

3685
02:51:02,481 --> 02:51:07,481
this new thing that he was involved in 
because finally his life had some 

3686
02:51:07,481 --> 02:51:10,391
meaning because without that and without
this spiritual connection to this jihad 

3687
02:51:10,401 --> 02:51:15,401
that he was about to commit,
like what kind of a connection did he 

3688
02:51:15,401 --> 02:51:15,401
have to his own existence?
I mean,

3689
02:51:15,401 --> 02:51:18,680
he might've been dancing through life 
completely aimlessly,

3690
02:51:18,681 --> 02:51:20,510
always depressed,
always sad,

3691
02:51:20,720 --> 02:51:22,850
and then all of a sudden he's a part of 
something exciting,

3692
02:51:23,030 --> 02:51:25,500
right?
They call them his brothers and all have

3693
02:51:25,600 --> 02:51:27,320
shit already.

3694
02:51:27,650 --> 02:51:28,610
Oh,
I mean,

3695
02:51:28,850 --> 02:51:33,850
you know,
one thing that I've recognized that I'm 

3696
02:51:33,850 --> 02:51:33,850
not,
obviously I'm not a religious person,

3697
02:51:33,850 --> 02:51:38,650
but one thing that I do recognize when I
watch me and even religions that have no

3698
02:51:39,501 --> 02:51:42,110
experience in it all,
like Islamic mosques,

3699
02:51:42,111 --> 02:51:47,111
when they're,
they're giving these speeches and 

3700
02:51:47,111 --> 02:51:47,590
they're talking about the value of Islam
that Islam as the truth and everybody's,

3701
02:51:48,010 --> 02:51:50,230
you know,
agreeing and you know,

3702
02:51:50,490 --> 02:51:51,800
saying,
you know,

3703
02:51:51,801 --> 02:51:52,610
I'll,
I'll walk by.

3704
02:51:52,611 --> 02:51:54,540
They're all like yelling it out.
And there's,

3705
02:51:54,590 --> 02:51:58,100
there's this feeling of camaraderie 
that's very attractive about that.

3706
02:51:58,310 --> 02:52:03,310
Even if you know what's bullshit,
even if you know it doesn't make any 

3707
02:52:03,310 --> 02:52:03,310
sense,
even if it's scientology,

3708
02:52:03,500 --> 02:52:04,780
even if it's,
you know,

3709
02:52:04,990 --> 02:52:09,990
mormonism,
whenever you got a big group of people 

3710
02:52:09,990 --> 02:52:09,990
that agree on something and they're all 
like,

3711
02:52:09,990 --> 02:52:11,950
fucking completely committed to it,
you're like,

3712
02:52:11,980 --> 02:52:13,480
oh,
I want to be in with those guys.

3713
02:52:13,810 --> 02:52:18,810
Like there's a part of you that wants to
be in that group because there's a lot 

3714
02:52:18,810 --> 02:52:19,840
of energy in that group.
They're committed to it,

3715
02:52:19,900 --> 02:52:24,900
you know,
they're all saying the same old ancient 

3716
02:52:24,900 --> 02:52:25,210
shit.
Allah walk chanting it together.

3717
02:52:25,211 --> 02:52:27,370
Like there's power in that.
You know,

3718
02:52:27,460 --> 02:52:29,440
why?
Because Islam is the truth and everybody

3719
02:52:29,441 --> 02:52:33,250
claps and you see that,
that,

3720
02:52:33,460 --> 02:52:35,650
that,
the draw of that,

3721
02:52:35,680 --> 02:52:37,270
like it's,
it's tangible to me.

3722
02:52:37,420 --> 02:52:39,550
I'm not joining.
I don't want to join,

3723
02:52:39,790 --> 02:52:44,790
but I would be lying if I said that I 
didn't see the appeal of the comradery 

3724
02:52:45,611 --> 02:52:48,700
of any sort of a group that you're 
absolutely committed to.

3725
02:52:48,930 --> 02:52:50,550
I think there's something really 
attractive,

3726
02:52:50,940 --> 02:52:53,370
attractive about being the person to 
stand back and be like,

3727
02:52:53,371 --> 02:52:55,110
wait a second,
this is all fucking shit.

3728
02:52:55,860 --> 02:52:56,670
You know what I mean?
Oh,

3729
02:52:56,671 --> 02:52:58,890
there's definitely that,
like there's definitely,

3730
02:52:58,900 --> 02:53:01,200
that'd be the person in the Middle East 
who has,

3731
02:53:01,440 --> 02:53:06,440
you know,
twitter on your phone and Google News 

3732
02:53:06,440 --> 02:53:09,650
and you can see the limitations of being
fed this angry radicalism based on some 

3733
02:53:10,381 --> 02:53:13,950
stuff that happened a thousand years ago
and use that too.

3734
02:53:14,100 --> 02:53:14,520
Yeah,

3735
02:53:15,280 --> 02:53:20,280
does that too.
But what I'm saying is the opposite of 

3736
02:53:20,280 --> 02:53:20,280
that.
What I'm saying is that I see the appeal

3737
02:53:20,280 --> 02:53:22,450
of joining these organizations.
We want to be a part of it.

3738
02:53:22,500 --> 02:53:25,200
Clam.
Have you seen the most wanted man?

3739
02:53:25,350 --> 02:53:25,790
No.
What's that?

3740
02:53:25,830 --> 02:53:28,770
It was a Philip Seymour Hoffman,
his last movie,

3741
02:53:28,771 --> 02:53:30,300
I just saw it recently.
It was a good,

3742
02:53:30,630 --> 02:53:32,370
it was good.
It's like a slow,

3743
02:53:32,490 --> 02:53:36,570
realistic version of a homeland episode 
so that they're in Hamburg,

3744
02:53:36,600 --> 02:53:41,600
Germany and he's this counterterrorism 
spy and they're tracking these a Muslim 

3745
02:53:42,301 --> 02:53:47,301
radicals through Hamburg and trying to 
build a case against one of them and so 

3746
02:53:47,301 --> 02:53:51,951
it really is like you see them more 
maybe realistic or maybe less glamorous 

3747
02:53:51,951 --> 02:53:56,100
side of counterterrorism and it's like,
at least based on this movie,

3748
02:53:56,101 --> 02:54:01,101
it's a lot of hanging around mosques and
trying to figure out who the bad guys 

3749
02:54:01,101 --> 02:54:01,101
are.
Yeah.

3750
02:54:01,101 --> 02:54:02,610
I would imagine there's a lot of that if
you're trying to infiltrate,

3751
02:54:02,700 --> 02:54:04,860
if you're really trying to become a part
of their movement,

3752
02:54:04,980 --> 02:54:07,080
but anyway,
point is it's a really good movie and it

3753
02:54:07,081 --> 02:54:12,081
gets you to see like just how fucked it 
is that these young guys get into these 

3754
02:54:12,511 --> 02:54:17,511
mosques and stuff and then become 
influenced by charismatic personalities 

3755
02:54:18,900 --> 02:54:21,110
and can do a lot of damage and it's the

3756
02:54:21,110 --> 02:54:26,110
pattern that's been established.
The pattern that's been established was 

3757
02:54:26,110 --> 02:54:26,900
one of violence,
suicide bombings and you know,

3758
02:54:27,320 --> 02:54:30,920
when that pattern becomes established,
that's what people sort of accept.

3759
02:54:30,921 --> 02:54:33,170
If that was that existed in 
Christianity,

3760
02:54:33,440 --> 02:54:38,440
Christianity was overwhelmed with 
suicide bombings and you know you and 

3761
02:54:38,440 --> 02:54:39,410
people really believe they're going to 
heaven,

3762
02:54:39,700 --> 02:54:41,450
they blew themselves up in a 
marketplace.

3763
02:54:41,760 --> 02:54:45,080
You'd you'd see similar behavior.
It's a human pattern.

3764
02:54:45,400 --> 02:54:47,360
It's when these patterns get 
established,

3765
02:54:47,361 --> 02:54:50,810
it's very difficult to break them off 
and it's.

3766
02:54:51,070 --> 02:54:56,070
It's weird how some get established,
but they're not logical like human 

3767
02:54:56,070 --> 02:54:59,120
patterns can be completely illogical.
Human patterns can involve cutting holes

3768
02:54:59,121 --> 02:55:02,210
in your lips and putting plates in them 
and stretching them out.

3769
02:55:02,390 --> 02:55:07,390
That's a a human pattern that somehow or
another got adopted and the size of the 

3770
02:55:07,390 --> 02:55:11,030
plate became directly proportionate to 
the amount of cows you're worth when you

3771
02:55:11,031 --> 02:55:11,750
get married.

3772
02:55:12,140 --> 02:55:14,780
That's so unlikely.
If you saw that on paper,

3773
02:55:14,781 --> 02:55:17,450
if somebody proposed that as an episode 
of a television show,

3774
02:55:17,451 --> 02:55:20,720
that there's these people that we run 
into and there are a tribe and they have

3775
02:55:20,721 --> 02:55:22,140
a plate.
They stick in their lives.

3776
02:55:22,190 --> 02:55:23,240
Why would they put a plate?
No Lip?

3777
02:55:23,510 --> 02:55:24,680
Well,
because the bigger the plate,

3778
02:55:24,681 --> 02:55:26,690
the more cows there'll be worth when 
they get married.

3779
02:55:26,870 --> 02:55:28,850
The Fuck Outta here.
That's a stupid plot point.

3780
02:55:29,090 --> 02:55:34,090
People wouldn't even agree with,
they would say that's a dumb idea for a 

3781
02:55:34,090 --> 02:55:35,480
show,
but meanwhile that is a very real thing.

3782
02:55:35,780 --> 02:55:37,310
I mean,
those people exist.

3783
02:55:37,311 --> 02:55:40,280
There's many photos of them.
They knock out their lower teeth,

3784
02:55:40,480 --> 02:55:43,430
the plates fit in better.
It's fucking ridiculous.

3785
02:55:43,790 --> 02:55:48,790
So patterns don't have to be logical.
They just have to exists and people slip

3786
02:55:48,801 --> 02:55:50,720
right into him.
You know the,

3787
02:55:50,780 --> 02:55:54,560
we've talked about this before,
but the semen people of New Guinea where

3788
02:55:54,561 --> 02:55:59,561
they force young boys to ingest their 
semen because it's going to make them 

3789
02:55:59,561 --> 02:56:00,410
grow stronger and healthier.

3790
02:56:00,650 --> 02:56:03,080
They call themselves the semen warriors.
Do they really?

3791
02:56:03,110 --> 02:56:08,110
Oh Dude,
it's the most lookup semen warriors of 

3792
02:56:08,110 --> 02:56:11,411
New Guinea.
It is one of the strangest fucking 

3793
02:56:11,411 --> 02:56:13,790
places in the world and you're talking 
about thousands of people,

3794
02:56:13,970 --> 02:56:18,970
thousands of people that do this.
They take the sun from the mom at an 

3795
02:56:18,970 --> 02:56:19,330
early age and the,
the,

3796
02:56:19,340 --> 02:56:22,520
the,
the new male companion,

3797
02:56:22,550 --> 02:56:25,430
whatever it is,
starts but fucking them in mouth.

3798
02:56:25,440 --> 02:56:27,000
Fuck him.
And that's how they,

3799
02:56:27,001 --> 02:56:30,170
they tell them they have to do this in 
order for them to grow strong.

3800
02:56:30,680 --> 02:56:33,920
I mean,
it's fucking crazy and that's a pattern.

3801
02:56:34,220 --> 02:56:39,220
That pattern is just,
it exists and it exists in a strange 

3802
02:56:39,220 --> 02:56:40,280
place,
but it's there.

3803
02:56:40,310 --> 02:56:45,310
They're isolated and you can study them 
and people have gone in there and 

3804
02:56:45,951 --> 02:56:50,951
examine their culture enough that they 
write on it and they have in detailed 

3805
02:56:50,951 --> 02:56:52,550
descriptions from people that have gone 
through it.

3806
02:56:52,940 --> 02:56:55,250
It's nuts.
That does sound extremely naughty.

3807
02:56:55,510 --> 02:56:57,790
It's people are fucking crazy.
David Seaman.

3808
02:56:58,280 --> 02:57:03,280
Crazy as fuck.
That's why we got to get people a 

3809
02:57:03,280 --> 02:57:04,310
upgraded.
Get them on bitcoin.

3810
02:57:04,460 --> 02:57:07,880
Do you in this fucking Bitcoin,
you're making me anti bitcoin.

3811
02:57:09,090 --> 02:57:11,900
One bitcoin out of your fucking mouth.
That's your solution for everything.

3812
02:57:11,901 --> 02:57:14,240
Bitcoin.
Mushrooms in Bitcoin.

3813
02:57:14,300 --> 02:57:16,280
That's what you should sell a t shirt 
on.

3814
02:57:16,281 --> 02:57:17,350
David Seaman.
Dotcom.

3815
02:57:17,540 --> 02:57:19,550
Mushrooms in Bitcoin and bitcoin.
Yeah.

3816
02:57:20,180 --> 02:57:22,760
Speaking of mushrooms the other day,
the New York Times,

3817
02:57:22,761 --> 02:57:27,761
the home page of the New York Times had 
an op Ed on mushrooms like very forward 

3818
02:57:27,801 --> 02:57:30,350
thinking shit,
and millions of people are reading that.

3819
02:57:30,351 --> 02:57:31,640
If it's on the New York Times.
Yeah.

3820
02:57:31,670 --> 02:57:34,100
Things are changing while they're being 
forced to catch up.

3821
02:57:34,250 --> 02:57:35,760
The Internet is,
you know,

3822
02:57:35,880 --> 02:57:39,260
Johns Hopkins University,
we publish that study many years ago,

3823
02:57:40,100 --> 02:57:45,100
the one about people that were taking 
psilocybin and had their lives changed 

3824
02:57:45,100 --> 02:57:49,451
for the better permanently.
There's been Mtma studies that had been 

3825
02:57:49,451 --> 02:57:49,490
released,
so there's a lot of studies.

3826
02:57:49,491 --> 02:57:54,491
It's like they're being forced to.
The were overwhelming amount of 

3827
02:57:54,491 --> 02:57:57,761
information that's coming out there are 
being forced to address it now in 

3828
02:57:57,761 --> 02:58:00,521
mainstream publications.
The CNN piece Iowasca Sanjay Gupta's 

3829
02:58:00,810 --> 02:58:04,200
pieces and is complete 180 degree 
turnaround on marijuana.

3830
02:58:05,590 --> 02:58:07,420
What's weird is when people who are 
critics go,

3831
02:58:07,421 --> 02:58:12,421
well,
you're not really connecting to some 

3832
02:58:12,421 --> 02:58:12,650
like global universal mind.
You're just done.

3833
02:58:13,030 --> 02:58:18,030
You're just ingesting the substance that
allows the two hemispheres of your mind 

3834
02:58:18,030 --> 02:58:18,130
to communicate better.
And if I go,

3835
02:58:18,131 --> 02:58:20,560
if that's the case,
why aren't I allowed to use that?

3836
02:58:20,800 --> 02:58:21,890
Right?
If it's something that's,

3837
02:58:22,080 --> 02:58:27,080
it's improving my cognitive ability or 
improving my mind's ability to figure,

3838
02:58:27,400 --> 02:58:28,870
figure out,
you know,

3839
02:58:28,871 --> 02:58:31,600
deep seated challenges,
what's wrong with that?

3840
02:58:31,710 --> 02:58:32,840
There's nothing wrong with it.
This isn't.

3841
02:58:32,870 --> 02:58:36,390
There's no bodies and people aren't 
dying of mushrooms and on top of that,

3842
02:58:36,391 --> 02:58:37,950
the people that say you're not doing 
this,

3843
02:58:37,951 --> 02:58:41,370
you're just doing that.
Unless you have personal experience in,

3844
02:58:42,020 --> 02:58:44,820
in like heavy duty,
breakthrough level,

3845
02:58:44,821 --> 02:58:49,821
psychedelic experiences.
Unless you have one of those under your 

3846
02:58:49,821 --> 02:58:52,881
belt,
you really don't know what you're 

3847
02:58:52,881 --> 02:58:52,881
talking about.
You,

3848
02:58:52,881 --> 02:58:54,940
you're,
you're guessing on what it's like and 

3849
02:58:54,940 --> 02:58:57,081
what it's like is so far beyond the 
capabilities of your imagination that 

3850
02:58:57,110 --> 02:59:02,110
this is a ridiculous conversation.
Is like a blind person trying to 

3851
02:59:02,110 --> 02:59:04,080
describe to you what the universe looks 
like and like you're like,

3852
02:59:04,081 --> 02:59:05,050
oh,
okay.

3853
02:59:05,340 --> 02:59:08,230
Well that's what it looks like to you 
and you can't say you can.

3854
02:59:08,231 --> 02:59:11,670
When you get your eyes fixed.
Come to me and I'll explain to you why I

3855
02:59:11,671 --> 02:59:16,671
know what blue looks like.
I explained to you with a chicken is 

3856
02:59:16,671 --> 02:59:17,220
I'll show you what the draft looks like 
in real life,

3857
02:59:17,520 --> 02:59:19,050
but right now you're just guessing.

3858
02:59:19,220 --> 02:59:22,500
Motherfucker can't figure out what a 
giraffe looks like with your fingers.

3859
02:59:22,770 --> 02:59:25,580
You got to put a lot of data together.
We tried to get a blind man,

3860
02:59:25,620 --> 02:59:30,620
draw a picture of a giraffe after you 
let them fucking handle this giraffe 

3861
02:59:30,620 --> 02:59:32,040
fondling and a giraffe Dick and reached 
out the draft,

3862
02:59:32,041 --> 02:59:37,041
like getting on a fucking step ladder,
reaching all the way up to the top of 

3863
02:59:37,041 --> 02:59:37,041
the draft patent net like,
okay,

3864
02:59:37,041 --> 02:59:41,991
draw a picture of the draft.
That fucking thing is going to look 

3865
02:59:41,991 --> 02:59:44,211
ridiculous.
Like a Chia pet with a fucking rate 

3866
02:59:44,211 --> 02:59:44,590
grown out of it.
Sadly,

3867
02:59:44,600 --> 02:59:45,840
I'm not going to know what that thing 
looks like.

3868
02:59:45,950 --> 02:59:46,280
Yeah,

3869
02:59:48,100 --> 02:59:49,500
the end.
David Seaman.

3870
02:59:49,510 --> 02:59:51,460
We're out of time.
We'll just sit three hours.

3871
02:59:51,490 --> 02:59:52,510
This is a lot of fun.
Yeah,

3872
02:59:52,511 --> 02:59:53,080
always,
man.

3873
02:59:53,160 --> 02:59:55,520
Only we'll only one piss break.
It doesn't seem like three hours.

3874
02:59:55,521 --> 02:59:55,580
Yeah,

3875
02:59:55,680 --> 02:59:57,140
did it?
You hung in there.

3876
02:59:57,190 --> 02:59:58,880
You've probably ready to go again right 
now,

3877
02:59:58,881 --> 02:59:59,690
aren't you?
I'm good.

3878
03:00:00,710 --> 03:00:02,810
You're good.
The power of bit coin is allowing him to

3879
03:00:02,811 --> 03:00:06,350
hold his bladder.

3886
03:00:24,760 --> 03:00:28,600
Always interesting conversations.
We will be back tomorrow with young bill

3887

Lots of.
Lots of good guests.

3889
03:00:33,401 --> 03:00:35,830
I'm very excited and you should be too.
Alright if you're not,

3890
03:00:36,100 --> 03:00:38,470
I get it.
I understand we've had a lot of these.

3891
03:00:38,471 --> 03:00:40,750
This is 582.
God Damn.

3892
03:00:40,780 --> 03:00:41,470
All right.
See you soon.

3893
03:00:41,560 --> 03:00:41,860
Bye.
Bye.

3894
03:00:41,861 --> 03:00:42,250
Big Kiss

3895
03:00:54,500 --> 03:00:59,500
people know and one of the advocates for
it and if I don't let people know how 

3896
03:00:59,500 --> 03:01:00,570
excited I am,
you're like,

3897
03:01:00,571 --> 03:01:01,630
dude,
why didn't you just.

3898
03:01:01,670 --> 03:01:04,670
That was your chance to tell people 
about bitcoin and I'm like,

3899
03:01:04,680 --> 03:01:05,160
I guess.
