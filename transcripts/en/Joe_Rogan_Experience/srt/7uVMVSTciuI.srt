1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,620
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:06,240
So I love it when your song was released
and then it was destroying the charts

3
00:00:06,241 --> 00:00:08,940
for Tlc and then you've gay TRL,

4
00:00:08,941 --> 00:00:09,774
TRL,

5
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:10,560
and then did you,

6
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,450
were you forced to get rid of us?

7
00:00:12,451 --> 00:00:14,160
I was forced to for 98 degrees.

8
00:00:14,161 --> 00:00:14,994
That whole thing was,

9
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:15,900
it's a very,

10
00:00:15,901 --> 00:00:16,734
um,

11
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,630
it's a very,

12
00:00:18,631 --> 00:00:19,464
uh,

13
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:20,401
you know,

14
00:00:20,401 --> 00:00:20,641
there's a,

15
00:00:20,641 --> 00:00:21,001
there's a,

16
00:00:21,001 --> 00:00:21,331
there's a,

17
00:00:21,331 --> 00:00:24,090
there's a little bit of a intrigue here.

18
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:24,690
Yeah.

19
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:26,460
The went behind the
story because there was,

20
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:27,511
you know,

21
00:00:27,511 --> 00:00:28,344
some,

22
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,450
some things done TRL that we're,

23
00:00:30,451 --> 00:00:32,190
we're not necessarily ever made public.

24
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:32,970
Right?

25
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:33,360
Like,

26
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:33,600
okay,

27
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,070
we'll fill me on the full detail.

28
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:35,761
What happened?

29
00:00:35,761 --> 00:00:36,181
What happened?

30
00:00:36,181 --> 00:00:37,320
Like the l story,

31
00:00:37,321 --> 00:00:39,660
the L and TRL isn't necessarily,

32
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,460
it's not necessarily live all the time.

33
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:42,840
What was your thought on any more?

34
00:00:42,841 --> 00:00:42,961
No,

35
00:00:42,961 --> 00:00:43,681
because it was the song,

36
00:00:43,681 --> 00:00:44,670
what was the song and what happened?

37
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:44,971
Okay.

38
00:00:44,971 --> 00:00:48,780
So we went to Seattle and we were
filming bits in Seattle and we thought,

39
00:00:48,781 --> 00:00:48,901
hey,

40
00:00:48,901 --> 00:00:51,720
this would be funny to do this song
called the bump bump song and my favorite

41
00:00:51,721 --> 00:00:51,991
songs,

42
00:00:51,991 --> 00:00:52,950
ridiculous idea.

43
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:53,431
And I would go,

44
00:00:53,431 --> 00:00:56,550
and it was just a silly video of me
going around from a Seattle saying,

45
00:00:56,551 --> 00:00:57,600
my bum is on the cheese,

46
00:00:57,601 --> 00:00:59,250
my bumps on the rail by bumps on the boat,

47
00:00:59,251 --> 00:01:00,084
my bumps on the duck,

48
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:00,590
all this,

49
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:04,210
it was a silly sort of like a
Dr Zeus style nursery rhyme,

50
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:05,380
rap and,

51
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:09,710
and the comedy of it was me out in the
street sticking my ass on everything and

52
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,670
confusing people and
filming the reactions,

53
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:12,090
right.

54
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:13,380
And singing the silly song.

55
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,330
And then we played it
on my show and we said,

56
00:01:15,331 --> 00:01:18,330
we want this to go to number
one on total request live,

57
00:01:18,331 --> 00:01:18,661
which is,

58
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:18,841
you know,

59
00:01:18,841 --> 00:01:23,130
their countdown music show that they
would have every night hosted by Carson

60
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:23,340
Daly.

61
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:23,761
And,

62
00:01:23,761 --> 00:01:24,594
um,

63
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,160
so we played it on Seattle radio
and it went to number one instantly.

64
00:01:29,161 --> 00:01:30,630
This was when my show was on MTV.

65
00:01:30,631 --> 00:01:30,840
It was,

66
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,081
it was,

67
00:01:31,081 --> 00:01:32,520
it was really doing well,

68
00:01:32,521 --> 00:01:33,090
show and empty.

69
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:34,890
The show is doing well on MTV people.

70
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:35,731
It went to number one,

71
00:01:35,731 --> 00:01:40,290
people saw the absurdity of
this song knocking 98 degrees,

72
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:45,291
Britney Spears in sync and whoever else
was on the j Lo I think out of the,

73
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:47,220
out of the number one spot.

74
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,240
And so we went,

75
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:48,931
we played on the show,

76
00:01:48,931 --> 00:01:50,280
we asked people to vote for it,

77
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:51,330
people voted for it.

78
00:01:51,331 --> 00:01:53,730
It went to number one on Tuesday.

79
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:53,941
Okay.

80
00:01:53,941 --> 00:01:55,500
The show I think aired on a Monday.

81
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:57,540
It went to number one on a Tuesday.

82
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:58,440
This is the song.

83
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,273
Yeah,

84
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:05,910
this was like fucking a huge,

85
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,360
this song was,

86
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,130
and this was the first uh,

87
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,220
song to be like,

88
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,920
this was right when MP
three s just started.

89
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:16,080
So it was the number one
downloaded song that year.

90
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:16,830
I thought you were,

91
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,440
I think 14 people downloaded.

92
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:19,573
No,

93
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:20,161
it was a,

94
00:02:20,161 --> 00:02:20,770
it was a,

95
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:20,941
no,

96
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:21,061
no,

97
00:02:21,061 --> 00:02:25,410
this was [inaudible] 99 to
2000 2099 so what happened?

98
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,180
So they squashed your song?

99
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:27,661
Yeah,

100
00:02:27,661 --> 00:02:29,040
it went to number one on Tuesday.

101
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:29,874
Then on Wednesday,

102
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,280
on Wednesday it was numb number one again.

103
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:32,850
Okay.

104
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:34,890
And then on Thursday it
was number one again.

105
00:02:34,891 --> 00:02:37,590
And then we got a call on Thursday
at the office and they're saying,

106
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:38,603
guys,

107
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,630
we want you to kind of
play ball with us here.

108
00:02:42,631 --> 00:02:42,961
And we're like,

109
00:02:42,961 --> 00:02:43,561
well what's the deal?

110
00:02:43,561 --> 00:02:43,771
They said,

111
00:02:43,771 --> 00:02:44,850
well you know we need,

112
00:02:44,851 --> 00:02:49,740
we need you to go on the show on Friday
and retire the bum bum song and take it

113
00:02:49,741 --> 00:02:50,610
off the countdown.

114
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,833
And we're like,

115
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:52,441
why?

116
00:02:52,441 --> 00:02:56,100
It's we've got the number one
song in America on MTV man.

117
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:56,341
Yeah,

118
00:02:56,341 --> 00:02:57,330
right is amazing.

119
00:02:57,331 --> 00:02:57,570
Right?

120
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:58,430
Money off this shit.

121
00:02:58,431 --> 00:02:59,530
This is unbelievable.

122
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:00,700
Let's keep it number one.

123
00:03:00,701 --> 00:03:00,911
They go,

124
00:03:00,911 --> 00:03:04,870
well the thing is we've pre taped the
show next week cause Carson's got to be in

125
00:03:04,871 --> 00:03:06,430
San Francisco and all this stuff.

126
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:07,421
So we're kind of,

127
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:09,130
it's kind of like who
we think's going to be,

128
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:09,400
right?

129
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,940
And we hadn't predicted you Erin the
show on Monday and it instantly going to

130
00:03:12,941 --> 00:03:13,720
number one.

131
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,910
So kind of screws up next week's pre tape,

132
00:03:15,911 --> 00:03:16,990
which is all in the can.

133
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:20,920
So can you go on on a Friday and just
retire it and we'll give you like a

134
00:03:20,921 --> 00:03:22,250
retirement home plaque.

135
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,840
And here I was on MTV and I had my show
on MTV and I didn't want to get fired.

136
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:26,500
Right.

137
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,170
Everybody's already mad at
me about all this other shit.

138
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:29,410
Right.

139
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:30,820
Screaming at me all day about,

140
00:03:30,821 --> 00:03:31,031
you know,

141
00:03:31,031 --> 00:03:33,610
I want to suck milk out of a cow's
udder cause I think it will be crazy.

142
00:03:33,611 --> 00:03:34,361
Let's put it on TV.

143
00:03:34,361 --> 00:03:34,720
And they're like,

144
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,650
can't you can't do that.

145
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:36,030
You know,

146
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,630
we're arguing nonstop.

147
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,200
It was like,

148
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,760
it was the most stressful time in my life.

149
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,280
And that's saying something because I'm
pretty stressed out right now to now,

150
00:03:42,281 --> 00:03:42,641
right now,

151
00:03:42,641 --> 00:03:43,391
but most of the time,

152
00:03:43,391 --> 00:03:43,780
you know,

153
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,613
and so,

154
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,160
so I'm on the show and I'm getting
yelled at all the time by everybody.

155
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:49,360
Everyone's always screaming at each other,

156
00:03:49,361 --> 00:03:49,841
trying to like,

157
00:03:49,841 --> 00:03:50,021
you know,

158
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,850
make the show crazy or make it less crazy.

159
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:52,391
And then,

160
00:03:52,391 --> 00:03:52,541
so,

161
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:52,751
you know,

162
00:03:52,751 --> 00:03:53,291
I played ball,

163
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:55,300
I went and I got a nice plaque and it,

164
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:55,541
you know what?

165
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:56,770
I'm not even to be honest with you,

166
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:57,731
not eat well.

167
00:03:57,731 --> 00:03:58,564
Yeah.

168
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:58,991
You know,

169
00:03:58,991 --> 00:03:59,771
I think of it now.

170
00:03:59,771 --> 00:04:00,071
I think,

171
00:04:00,071 --> 00:04:00,251
you know,

172
00:04:00,251 --> 00:04:02,050
we could have rode that
thing a little further.

173
00:04:02,051 --> 00:04:03,370
I could have put out record,

174
00:04:03,371 --> 00:04:04,204
I probably could,

175
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:04,991
you know,

176
00:04:04,991 --> 00:04:06,010
had some fun with that.

177
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,173
But um,

178
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:07,540
yeah,

179
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,260
that's what happened.

180
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,070
That's what happened.

181
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:09,460
That's,

182
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,470
that's interesting man.

183
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:13,470
You got Fox got fucked
by the corporations.

184
00:04:13,471 --> 00:04:13,740
Yeah,

185
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:14,130
exactly.

186
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:14,301
It was,

187
00:04:14,301 --> 00:04:15,134
it would make sense to other,

188
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,740
they would probably cost him a fuck load
of money if they had already pre tape

189
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,770
thing there reshoot five
shows and it's like,

190
00:04:19,771 --> 00:04:20,130
you know,

191
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:20,931
how crazy is that?

192
00:04:20,931 --> 00:04:23,360
And now you find out what
their rankings are like total,

193
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,540
they paid them up.

194
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,300
It probably had deals
with the record company.

195
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,760
Like we need to push 98
degrees and a here's $100,000.

196
00:04:29,761 --> 00:04:30,670
We need to get to do that.

197
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,700
Probably it's so that's illegal.

198
00:04:32,701 --> 00:04:33,534
I mean that's,

199
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:34,803
Delphine did that.

200
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:35,880
They did that.

201
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,470
I never heard any just making shit up.

202
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:37,710
No,

203
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:37,980
no.

204
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,270
I'm just throwing shit on the table.

205
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:41,490
I have never did anything like that.

206
00:04:41,491 --> 00:04:42,480
I think it was just basically,

207
00:04:42,481 --> 00:04:43,710
it was a very strange week.

208
00:04:43,711 --> 00:04:43,951
And,

209
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:44,050
uh,

210
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:44,271
they,

211
00:04:44,271 --> 00:04:44,600
they,

212
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,130
they'd sort of,

213
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:46,110
if it wasn't for that week,

214
00:04:46,111 --> 00:04:47,880
that song could have
stayed on the countdown.

215
00:04:47,881 --> 00:04:48,750
And because I can't,

216
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,321
but you know,

217
00:04:49,321 --> 00:04:49,531
I've,

218
00:04:49,531 --> 00:04:49,671
I've,

219
00:04:49,671 --> 00:04:49,980
I've,

220
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:50,940
I've told that story before.

221
00:04:50,941 --> 00:04:52,920
I don't think anyone at MTV
cares anymore about that.

222
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:53,881
Well,

223
00:04:53,881 --> 00:04:54,714
why would they care?

224
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:55,763
Fuck fucked you.

225
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:56,970
You're the one supposed to care.

226
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:57,930
You have got paid.

227
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,140
So drive in that fucking song right now.

228
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:01,710
Yup.

229
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,630
In the form of a Red Ferrari.

230
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:04,081
Yeah,

231
00:05:04,081 --> 00:05:04,501
that's true.

232
00:05:04,501 --> 00:05:08,460
I'm saying you could be rolling with
a big fat diamond encrusted watch,

233
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,520
letting bitches know.

234
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:11,790
And they'd be like,

235
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:12,480
Tom Green.

236
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,100
How'd you get so rich bum,

237
00:05:14,101 --> 00:05:14,820
bum,

238
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:15,720
bum bum song.

239
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:38,843
Okay,

240
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:44,580
you ready?

241
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,350
Of course recording.

242
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:46,671
Oh,

243
00:05:46,671 --> 00:05:47,504
it is already.

244
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:48,590
What the fuck's on?
