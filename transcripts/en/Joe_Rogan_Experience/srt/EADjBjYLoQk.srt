1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,860
Changed my life.
Five,

2
00:00:01,861 --> 00:00:03,090
four,
three,

3
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:04,470
two,
one.

4
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:08,620
Yes.
Dan Dodi.

5
00:00:08,621 --> 00:00:09,850
Yes,
we're live.

6
00:00:09,851 --> 00:00:11,050
What's up brother?
How are you man?

7
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,520
Good to see Ya.
Good to see you too man.

8
00:00:12,521 --> 00:00:13,354
So,
uh,

9
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,940
for people don't know.
Uh,

10
00:00:14,941 --> 00:00:19,420
I met Dan way back in 2012 does,
that seems like a long time ago now.

11
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,430
It seems like,
uh,

12
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:23,600
at least half of my life,
which is not even close to,

13
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,170
is that true?
I mean why is it like five years?

14
00:00:26,171 --> 00:00:27,340
It was five years ago.
Yeah,

15
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:30,820
I thought a half years ago.
Well that was back when it was October

16
00:00:30,821 --> 00:00:33,100
of 2012.
I thought there was only two months left

17
00:00:33,101 --> 00:00:37,880
in the world cause I thought the Mayan
calendar was correct and it was December

18
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:38,770
21st,
2012 was going to end the world.

19
00:00:38,771 --> 00:00:39,604
Okay.

20
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,300
So yeah.
So you fucked off and went to Montana to

21
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,580
go on a boat ride with us.
Yeah,

22
00:00:45,581 --> 00:00:49,780
we took a,
we took a canoe down the Missouri River.

23
00:00:49,781 --> 00:00:51,070
That was fucking awesome,
man.

24
00:00:51,071 --> 00:00:53,350
Isn't that wild?
It's one of my favorite trips ever.

25
00:00:53,351 --> 00:00:55,180
Was cold,
really cold,

26
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:56,430
like not fun.
Cold.

27
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,420
It was cold.
That gets sucked.

28
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,940
But once he got moved and it was fine,
you know,

29
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:03,610
and I,
I learned about Merino wool.

30
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:06,580
That was the important,
there was an important lesson like the

31
00:01:06,581 --> 00:01:10,660
first light Merino wool like that people
don't know if you're ever in a cold

32
00:01:10,661 --> 00:01:13,120
area.
It's so important that you have a base

33
00:01:13,121 --> 00:01:16,600
layer of Merino wool cause that shit
gets wet and you stay warm.

34
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:20,100
Even if you sweat in it,
you stay warm and calf as much as,

35
00:01:20,101 --> 00:01:24,390
as the synthetic versions at all.
It's weird like some people really liked

36
00:01:24,391 --> 00:01:27,440
synthetics in some weird way like use
them or did you,

37
00:01:27,441 --> 00:01:30,070
do you have I have this,
I smelled terrible.

38
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:32,770
So you actually don't care.
I like them both but I just,

39
00:01:32,771 --> 00:01:34,740
you know,
working with those guys for so long and,

40
00:01:34,741 --> 00:01:37,310
and firstlight I got used to it.
I like it.

41
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:40,150
I like it.
But I use synthetics for 10 years before

42
00:01:40,151 --> 00:01:43,330
that and I mean I didn't smell good but
didn't really care.

43
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,440
A lot of mountaineering people like some
synthetics because they dry quicker.

44
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,270
Yeah.
But I feel like the,

45
00:01:49,271 --> 00:01:52,300
one of the best benefits of the wall is
that when it is wet,

46
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:55,600
it's still retains your warmth.
And I don't mind being a little moist.

47
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,670
Well,
the synthetics will keep you warm too

48
00:01:57,671 --> 00:02:00,130
when they're wet.
Just it's slightly different value.

49
00:02:00,131 --> 00:02:05,131
Like cotton will not right it all night,
but it's synthetic like a kathleen that

50
00:02:05,261 --> 00:02:06,490
Patagonia is,
is there other things?

51
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:07,870
They also will,
they won't,

52
00:02:07,871 --> 00:02:09,340
they won't kill you.
Um,

53
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:10,950
but yeah.
Uh,

54
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,390
the,
the Marino has some other better

55
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:13,950
qualities.

56
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:16,780
Yeah.
Well the stink things huge because I

57
00:02:16,781 --> 00:02:19,120
fuck it smelled terrible.
That was a fun trip,

58
00:02:19,121 --> 00:02:21,650
man.
That was actually the first episode of

59
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:23,040
that show that I,
um,

60
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:26,950
that I fully kind of shot and directed
myself.

61
00:02:26,951 --> 00:02:29,530
So that was kind of a big stage from,
it was fun.

62
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,580
Yeah.
I just basically hung out with Kalyn two

63
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,060
per week.
Will you have,

64
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:36,160
when you have Cowan,
when Collin has a,

65
00:02:36,161 --> 00:02:38,770
like a captive audience,
he's the funniest man alive.

66
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:41,700
I will never forget these things.
I won't share them.

67
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:45,070
Let's go ahead.
I these scenes from that campfire,

68
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,720
do you remember the ravine calmer?
Oh,

69
00:02:46,721 --> 00:02:50,110
I remember,
I remember him taking a shit.

70
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:53,040
Literally 10 feet from our campfire is
asked,

71
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:56,440
sticking out and we put a flag in it.
I took pictures of it and how that shit

72
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:59,560
that we put it in aluminum flag on it
and stuck in there.

73
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,960
I've never touched another man's shit
other than his,

74
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:05,650
I tried to set up a hunt for myself last
year and the brakes and it just ended up

75
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,150
didn't happening.
But uh,

76
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,810
it's one of my favorite places.
It's so lonely out there,

77
00:03:10,811 --> 00:03:14,230
but so amazing.
That area is so,

78
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:20,220
it's such a perfect place to introduce
count and I to the world of hunting

79
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,710
because it's so wild with multifaceted
too.

80
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,690
You have a lot of history there.
You have the,

81
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,391
yeah.
You know,

82
00:03:26,391 --> 00:03:28,210
it's,
it's one of those areas where it's a

83
00:03:28,211 --> 00:03:30,760
complete wilderness experience cause
you're on the water right there.

84
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,620
You weren't,
we're not crossing roads like we got

85
00:03:32,621 --> 00:03:36,270
dropped off at the end of a road and
floated to basically the next row down

86
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,510
the river,
which is a big deal.

87
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,750
We floated 40 miles down over the course
of,

88
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:42,580
what was it?
Six days is one of my,

89
00:03:42,581 --> 00:03:43,480
one of these bucks.

90
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,530
Yeah.
That one right there.

91
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,970
That's the buck right there.
Hey Buddy.

92
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,970
Hey Fella.
That's a different time.

93
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,580
That was in Wisconsin.
That was one where it was constant,

94
00:03:51,581 --> 00:03:53,560
that video that you just put up.
But um,

95
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:55,750
when we did do that,
man,

96
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,840
it was a,
that was where Lewis and Clark had made

97
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:03,040
some stops expedition.
And that's where one of the coolest

98
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:06,610
things about doing it with Rinella,
cause he knows so much about the history

99
00:04:06,611 --> 00:04:09,460
of the United States and the,
the settling of the United States and

100
00:04:09,461 --> 00:04:12,220
also the Nez perce Indian stories that
he would tell us.

101
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,290
Oh yeah,
he can touch shit years.

102
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,870
Yeah.
And that's when I heard the story about

103
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,640
the,
what the real story,

104
00:04:18,641 --> 00:04:21,370
the original story about the Leonardo
Dicaprio movie.

105
00:04:21,371 --> 00:04:23,470
The revenant.
Like what really happened?

106
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,060
Oh,
he told her to a movie.

107
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:25,930
Okay.
Yeah.

108
00:04:25,931 --> 00:04:28,930
He told me that story.
The actual story about the guy that got

109
00:04:28,931 --> 00:04:32,470
left behind and crawled back many,
many miles.

110
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:35,050
What's the guy's name?
I don't remember the actual guy's name,

111
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:37,510
but there's so much they made up in the
movie.

112
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:39,370
It's just to kind of brutal.
Yeah.

113
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,820
It was a freaky movie.
It wasn't pretty.

114
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:42,980
The grizzly bear attack.
Yeah.

115
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:46,080
It was a real freaky thing.
The real grizzly bear attack.

116
00:04:46,081 --> 00:04:48,760
So man,
I bet the real grizzly just kind of

117
00:04:48,761 --> 00:04:53,320
swatted that dude once and then just he
fell down and it left him alone.

118
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,930
Why do you think that?
Cause that thing would have torn to

119
00:04:55,931 --> 00:04:58,860
pieces.
It was a giant bear too.

120
00:04:58,861 --> 00:05:01,360
And I just fuck bears,
man.

121
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:05,140
They scare the shit out of me.
I wonder really the average length of

122
00:05:05,141 --> 00:05:07,060
time of a bear attack?
Like how long has it lasts?

123
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,160
Two seconds.
30 seconds.

124
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,230
Well the um,
that movie grizzly man,

125
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:15,760
apparently the audio of him getting
killed by the bears like seven minutes

126
00:05:15,761 --> 00:05:16,740
long and listen to that.

127
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:17,831
That was terrible.
No,

128
00:05:17,831 --> 00:05:19,960
it's not real.
The one you listened to online's not

129
00:05:19,961 --> 00:05:20,980
real.
Oh no shit.

130
00:05:20,981 --> 00:05:21,970
It's fake.
Yeah.

131
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,160
Yeah.
The actual audio was never released.

132
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,550
Life is a lie.
Yeah.

133
00:05:25,551 --> 00:05:30,220
I have somebody send it to me too,
but then I looked into it and Werner

134
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:33,130
Herzog and the woman who owns the actual
audio,

135
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,020
they got rid of it.
They destroyed it.

136
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:37,960
They never listened to it,
and Werner Herzog actually told her to

137
00:05:37,961 --> 00:05:40,530
destroy it in the documentary.
So the one,

138
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,550
when you hear it online,
it's just fake.

139
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:44,890
And then once you know it's fake and you
listen to it,

140
00:05:44,891 --> 00:05:46,210
you go,
oh,

141
00:05:46,211 --> 00:05:48,250
this shit's fake.
You like you can hear it.

142
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:50,620
You want to hear it.
I'm not going to listen to it again,

143
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,580
but you can.
Sure.

144
00:05:51,581 --> 00:05:54,210
Yeah.
We really want to see,

145
00:05:54,211 --> 00:05:57,650
do you find that grizzly man audio who
you hear it and you go,

146
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:59,240
oh yeah,
this isn't real.

147
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,970
That's one of my top five movies of all
time though.

148
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,740
It's a great movie.
Credible to one of the funniest movies

149
00:06:03,741 --> 00:06:06,570
ever as far as unintentional comedy.
Oh my God.

150
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:10,100
That's funny.
Was it the sheriff?

151
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,570
The sheriff goes,
well,

152
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:15,760
I thought he was retarded
here,

153
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,170
here,
here,

154
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:23,170
like screams and shed
all the fox audio bear attack.

155
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:33,620
Why is it echoing here?
The echo that was done in the room.

156
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:35,570
All these,
these voices,

157
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,270
these supposed to be in the woods.
Yeah,

158
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,570
that's definitely,
that audio is unquestionably done in a

159
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,680
room somewhere.
Oh Sierra.

160
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,880
It's fake horse.
See now you know those mother fuckers,

161
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,140
they got us.
Do you think they benefited from

162
00:06:54,141 --> 00:06:56,000
creating that?
Probably.

163
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:59,150
Yeah.
Somebody probably put up some youtube

164
00:06:59,151 --> 00:07:00,770
ads and made some cash.
All right.

165
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,410
It's entirely possible.
Or they just did it for fun.

166
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,270
It sounded like people were having a
good time.

167
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,680
You guys,
the guy's yelling.

168
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:09,970
It sounds like you can almost kind of
like here in his yellow.

169
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,030
It's like,
Holy Shit,

170
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:13,520
someone's going to believe this.
This is so ridiculous.

171
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:19,600
But it's supposedly lasted seven minutes
because they're just start leading them.

172
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:22,160
Wait,
so what's that?

173
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:26,000
What does that stat that's not from like
the real audio last bought actual

174
00:07:26,001 --> 00:07:28,440
audience because the bears not trying to
kill him.

175
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,840
It's just eating them.
Yeah.

176
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:33,620
Cause bears apparently,
well I've seen bears kill moose in

177
00:07:33,621 --> 00:07:37,550
videos and they just start eating them.
They don't kill him right away.

178
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,710
I know all of them down to wolves do
too.

179
00:07:39,711 --> 00:07:41,960
They just eat right away.
They start right at the back end and

180
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:44,090
start eating you.
They don't,

181
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:46,040
they don't bother.
They don't have the decency.

182
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:49,040
Like at least a mountain lion kills Ya.
You know,

183
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,080
cats kill.
Yeah.

184
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:53,090
Bears and wolves.
They just eat you.

185
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,440
I guess they just don't need to,
they don't need to incapacitate

186
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,150
everybody there.
Well,

187
00:07:59,151 --> 00:08:01,280
I think it's also a thing with
omnivores.

188
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:05,600
Omnivores,
I think don't have that instinct to

189
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,490
instantly kill.
And that's interesting.

190
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,020
Yeah.
But that doesn't make sense though.

191
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,720
My theory sucks because of wolves,
because wolves.

192
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:14,630
Yeah.
Yeah.

193
00:08:14,631 --> 00:08:17,570
So maybe it's interesting.
I don't know.

194
00:08:17,571 --> 00:08:20,210
I mean they,
they do that because they have to,

195
00:08:20,211 --> 00:08:20,630
right?

196
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:21,740
Like that's how they,
they take,

197
00:08:21,741 --> 00:08:23,600
they take on a running animal itself
kills.

198
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:25,010
They snap at the legs,
right?

199
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,360
Yeah.
And then they just,

200
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,690
it's the easiest,
softest part of me just start eating on

201
00:08:29,691 --> 00:08:33,500
the back end.
I was listening to a podcast today about

202
00:08:33,501 --> 00:08:37,610
wolves and Idaho where they were talking
about how when you go deep into the back

203
00:08:37,611 --> 00:08:40,640
country where people can't get to or
where it's very difficult,

204
00:08:40,641 --> 00:08:43,010
really rocky terrain,
the wolves are just running,

205
00:08:43,011 --> 00:08:45,410
ramping out there.
They just have so many wolves there.

206
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,150
Ever seen one in the wild?
No,

207
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:49,700
she put that on your list.
I actually did see one,

208
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:54,750
you know Berta I think,
but it was at twilight and it was dog

209
00:08:55,651 --> 00:08:59,910
sized and it ran across the road and it
was a little too big to be a coyote.

210
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,380
Sure.
In my mind.

211
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:04,860
But I thought I saw a wolf for like two
seconds and it was a squirrel.

212
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:10,010
So take that thought.
I've seen a couple of the most memorable

213
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:14,820
we where we were in a valley in Alaska
and it was dusk and uh,

214
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:16,950
you know,
just too massive mountain ranges on each

215
00:09:16,951 --> 00:09:18,720
side.
And uh,

216
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:19,830
I don't know,
it might've been the honest,

217
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:23,490
somebody yelled and somebody spotted one
across the river and we went and looked

218
00:09:23,491 --> 00:09:26,550
at it and it was,
it was men.

219
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,860
My memory is failing.
He was either pure white,

220
00:09:28,861 --> 00:09:32,280
I think it was pure white and it just,
I swear to God it's shown,

221
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:35,790
I it just like emanated light and it was
the most like regal,

222
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:38,610
beautiful,
just like perfect,

223
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:40,530
perfect.
And it just sort of trotted along the

224
00:09:40,531 --> 00:09:43,250
river and disappeared back in the woods
and they're amazing.

225
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:47,100
And I was thinking about it this morning
on a hike here,

226
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:49,320
I was looking for mountain lion tracks,
but you know,

227
00:09:49,321 --> 00:09:52,860
the sign at the trailhead says,
gives you warning about mountain lions

228
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:54,120
are out here for sure.

229
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,740
Yeah.
I never really,

230
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,900
um,
I don't know.

231
00:09:57,901 --> 00:10:02,440
The only thing that ever gives me pause
in the woods is a grizzly because you

232
00:10:02,441 --> 00:10:03,274
know,
Steve and I,

233
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:06,330
we got charged that once and ever since
that happened,

234
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:11,810
my a bear radar is more intense and it's
just such a freaky animal.

235
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,110
Yeah.
When you see what a grizzly really is,

236
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,860
essentially a thousand pound giant wild
dog,

237
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,600
have you seen those in the wild yourself
yet?

238
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:22,260
Grisly.
Yeah.

239
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,400
No,
never seen a grizzly.

240
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:25,320
Not In the wild.
I've seen them,

241
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:28,260
you know,
live in a sanctuary and I've seen a lot

242
00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:28,771
of,
oh no,

243
00:10:28,771 --> 00:10:32,160
I did see a Grizzly,
I saw small grizzly in Alberta,

244
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:33,450
uh,
last year.

245
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,280
Yeah.
But it wasn't that big.

246
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:38,130
It was like maybe six and a half,
seven feet.

247
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,840
It was on the stand where you're pretty
close.

248
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,250
Yeah,
it was very close.

249
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,530
It was like 30 or 40 yards from us.

250
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,520
Yeah.
Yeah.

251
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:48,330
But it took off pretty quick.
But it wasn't a Grizzly,

252
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,930
like they had some trail cam photos of
like fucking tankers.

253
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:55,530
They were Goddamn VW buses.
This was like a juvenile.

254
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:58,320
So it was probably like I said,
probably like six and a half feet or

255
00:10:58,321 --> 00:11:00,600
something like that where I live in
Bozeman.

256
00:11:00,601 --> 00:11:03,090
So it's literally a line right where we
are.

257
00:11:03,091 --> 00:11:05,580
So south of us is the Gallatin range in
the Madison Range,

258
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:08,820
just full full of grizzlies.
But just north of town,

259
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:11,190
there's the bridger range and a couple
other ranges too.

260
00:11:11,191 --> 00:11:16,191
And for whatever reason that is an
impasse to the population of bears.

261
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,390
Why is rls?
Do they have any ideas?

262
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,890
I mean,
it might be,

263
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,600
um,
just physicality.

264
00:11:21,601 --> 00:11:25,590
And my actually Steve Rainelle would be
the one that I've heard him talk about

265
00:11:25,591 --> 00:11:26,820
this.
He would know exactly,

266
00:11:26,821 --> 00:11:29,640
but it's either a physical impasse or
it's,

267
00:11:29,641 --> 00:11:32,040
it's the human and the proximity to
humans,

268
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:33,480
the of the,
of the town and all this.

269
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,860
But the way that it relates is that,
you know,

270
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,550
if I'm going to go hiking with my little
baby boy,

271
00:11:38,551 --> 00:11:42,290
oh boy,
I choose to go north just because,

272
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:43,920
you know,
I don't think I would always thought

273
00:11:43,921 --> 00:11:45,570
that way.
And I carry bear spray.

274
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,600
Usually I carry a pistol.
I don't,

275
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:53,290
I probably will in the future just
because that guy he was from Bozeman got

276
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:54,340
attacked last year.

277
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,950
Yeah.
He got tore up and that was horrific.

278
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:59,620
Oh yeah.
His scalp is hanging off his head while

279
00:11:59,621 --> 00:12:01,040
he's making the video.
It was a gnarly,

280
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,070
and he wasn't hunting,
he was just hiking.

281
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:06,760
He was scouting and um,
he used bear spray and it didn't work.

282
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:09,010
It was a sow with her cubs.
Yeah.

283
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:10,850
So that's about,
I dunno,

284
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:14,170
50 miles from where I live.
It's where he got hit 60 miles.

285
00:12:14,171 --> 00:12:15,430
Something like that.
Close.

286
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:16,540
Yeah.
Jesus.

287
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,090
Yeah.
Nothing to mess around with.

288
00:12:19,091 --> 00:12:21,190
Man.
I think it's awesome that they exist.

289
00:12:21,191 --> 00:12:23,290
I really,
I think it's so cool that they exist.

290
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:27,100
I don't want him to not exist,
but at the same time I don't want to be

291
00:12:27,101 --> 00:12:27,940
near them.
Yeah.

292
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,560
You know,
I don't want to encounter him.

293
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,030
So it's,
so uh,

294
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:33,041
yeah,
I'm,

295
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:36,370
I'm more sensitive to them now.
I have really have a deep,

296
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,050
deep love for them.

297
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:40,750
Sharks on the other hand,
we could just kill them.

298
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:44,770
What's weird?
People are getting like really touchy

299
00:12:44,771 --> 00:12:47,800
feely about sharks because they hear all
about these sharks getting slaughtered

300
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:49,360
for shark fin soup.
Oh,

301
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:49,991
like,
yeah.

302
00:12:49,991 --> 00:12:54,991
The governor I think of New York caught
a shark fishing totally legal and not an

303
00:12:57,071 --> 00:13:02,071
endangered fish at all and he got so
much hate because people who,

304
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:06,220
it's like we were talking before about
science that so many people want to

305
00:13:06,221 --> 00:13:09,490
argue things online but they don't want
to actually like look into like what are

306
00:13:09,491 --> 00:13:12,220
the studies that had been done and how
much do people actually know?

307
00:13:12,221 --> 00:13:14,500
What is the,
I know people want to have an opinion.

308
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:17,980
They have this like narrow window of
information and then I'm just going to

309
00:13:17,981 --> 00:13:20,620
run with my opinion and say,
fuck you for killing that shark.

310
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:21,610
Oh yeah.
You know,

311
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:25,100
it's like people have time necessarily
to go investigate everything.

312
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,670
They have an opinion about an issue.
No,

313
00:13:27,671 --> 00:13:30,790
but they do have time to tweet about it.
Get Mad at the governor.

314
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:33,820
Was it the governor,
was it the mayor of New York that that

315
00:13:33,821 --> 00:13:35,200
got in trouble for the shark?
Well,

316
00:13:35,201 --> 00:13:37,900
you didn't get in trouble because what
he did was totally legal and they cooked

317
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:41,860
it and Maaco shark is delicious.
[inaudible] ever had.

318
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:43,300
And the Puerto Rico,
they serve,

319
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:46,270
they serve shark everywhere.
Like you go to a food stand,

320
00:13:46,271 --> 00:13:48,100
they fry shark,
put it on a stick.

321
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:50,020
It's a fish machine.
It's an ocean.

322
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:51,310
It's an ocean out there.
It is.

323
00:13:51,311 --> 00:13:54,430
New York governor sparks anger after
killing threatened shark.

324
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:56,650
But it's not threatened.
That's not true.

325
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:01,060
Why does it say threatened shark?
That's not a threatened animal thresher

326
00:14:01,061 --> 00:14:01,800
shark yet.
I don't,

327
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,820
I don't think it said threatened.
Right.

328
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,520
It's it fresher.
Did it say in the headline?

329
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,661
Oh,
threaten.

330
00:14:07,661 --> 00:14:08,470
Oh yeah.

331
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:10,450
So threatened.
I don't think that's true.

332
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:13,960
I do not think that's a threatened
animal.

333
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,960
I'd have to look at it.
I have all three species of thresher.

334
00:14:16,961 --> 00:14:21,490
Shark is listed as vulnerable by the
International Union for conservation of

335
00:14:21,491 --> 00:14:23,850
nature because of their declining
populations.

336
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:27,790
Fishing for them is regulated in the
National Oceanic and atmospheric

337
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:29,590
administration,
but it is not illegal.

338
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:31,750
Okay.
Despite its legality,

339
00:14:31,751 --> 00:14:36,490
you and patrons of the ocean,
Lewis said the killing and subsequent

340
00:14:36,491 --> 00:14:38,020
photos were a porn.
Oh,

341
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:42,610
it might be a Twat and worked against
those trying to conserve dwindling shark

342
00:14:42,611 --> 00:14:44,320
numbers.
Um Hm.

343
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,300
Okay.
Yeah.

344
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,920
All right.
Well maybe he's right.

345
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,910
I know that some of them are not.
I Dunno

346
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,930
man.
I mean you can't really control what

347
00:14:53,931 --> 00:14:55,730
kind of fish you catch when you go
fishing.

348
00:14:55,731 --> 00:14:57,980
And if you catch a fish that's legal.
I,

349
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,470
what do you do the problem with catch
and release?

350
00:15:00,471 --> 00:15:02,390
This is a dirty secret,
ladies and gentlemen,

351
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:05,720
because people do go catch and release
fishing and I've released fish before.

352
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:07,890
A lot of them die.
It's,

353
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:11,520
it's kind of weird.
Like is that a secret still you think

354
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:13,370
for some folks?
Yeah.

355
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,091
Yeah.
Not sure.

356
00:15:14,091 --> 00:15:15,860
Are you sure?
Oh,

357
00:15:15,861 --> 00:15:16,401
absolutely.
I mean,

358
00:15:16,401 --> 00:15:17,600
think about it.
I mean,

359
00:15:17,601 --> 00:15:21,050
it'd be like taking you and I,
Duncan is underwater for five minutes

360
00:15:21,051 --> 00:15:22,880
and putting us back you,
or even worse,

361
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:26,840
shoving a fucking barb through your face
and then drowning us because all we're

362
00:15:26,841 --> 00:15:29,240
doing to it and we're literally drowning
them.

363
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,850
Literally.
Yeah.

364
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:31,611
Well,
I mean,

365
00:15:31,611 --> 00:15:34,220
some people use barbless hooks,
which are better,

366
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:38,210
and the inside of the mouth of a fish is
very different than our mouth.

367
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:39,021
So like,
I mean,

368
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:39,711
there's Pratt,
right?

369
00:15:39,711 --> 00:15:41,070
There's best practices to,
to,

370
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,850
to harm the fish as little as possible.
And I think,

371
00:15:43,851 --> 00:15:45,120
you know,
that's why I say,

372
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,140
sure.
Yeah.

373
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,080
Fly fishing with barbless hooks.
Yeah.

374
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:50,360
You can.
Most likely you can.

375
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:53,250
Most of them are going to be fine,
but a lot of our night,

376
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,400
it's a weird practice.
I just don't,

377
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,560
I don't putting them back.
Yeah.

378
00:15:57,561 --> 00:15:58,460
Well it's just,
yeah.

379
00:15:58,510 --> 00:15:59,271
I'm,
I'm not,

380
00:15:59,271 --> 00:16:00,860
uh,
I'm not a catch and release fish

381
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:02,420
fisherman.
I'm not even a huge fisherman.

382
00:16:02,421 --> 00:16:04,250
I love to eat it.
I love to go to Alaska,

383
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:07,010
catch a buttload of fish,
come home and eat it for the rest of the

384
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:08,270
year.
I need to go halibut fishing.

385
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,490
Jesse,
do cause I've done that yet.

386
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,340
No,
no.

387
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:14,120
I love how I've gone fluke fishing.
I've caught flounder before,

388
00:16:14,121 --> 00:16:16,880
which a little baby halibut's but
they're delicious.

389
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:21,240
But halibut is supposed to be like one
of the most delicious fish to catch and

390
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,390
cook like right away.
Oh that's amazing.

391
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:24,800
I mean I,
it's um,

392
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:26,750
it's one of those rule of fleshy white
fish,

393
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:27,890
kinda like grouper,
grouper.

394
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:30,350
Um,
and uh,

395
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:31,870
yeah,
like chunks the hell,

396
00:16:31,871 --> 00:16:32,860
the deep fried,
like,

397
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,170
like a well coated and deep fried it
the,

398
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:37,190
the thing about how,
but if you overcook it though,

399
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,560
it's like chewing on a sock.
It just gets tough.

400
00:16:39,561 --> 00:16:41,810
Real fascinated.
That's true of other white flesh fish

401
00:16:41,811 --> 00:16:43,460
like that too.
But no,

402
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:45,560
it's delicious.
It's not the most exciting to catch.

403
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:46,910
Well,
there are giant doors.

404
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:51,170
Yeah.
You just like holding up his heavy ass.

405
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:55,580
They're so alien looking to two eyes on
one side of their head and they flatten

406
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:57,860
out at the bottom of the ocean.
You know that they're,

407
00:16:57,861 --> 00:16:58,850
I migrates.
Right.

408
00:16:59,180 --> 00:16:59,600
Really?

409
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,600
They start swimming up and down,
eyes on each side and then started a

410
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,833
part of their,
uh,

411
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:10,010
maturation processes.
They flip over as they're getting older.

412
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,660
Yeah.
As they're getting older and there I

413
00:17:11,661 --> 00:17:16,260
literally slides onto the other side,
but it stays there once it's,

414
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,160
yeah.
It's not like I can't go back and forth

415
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:22,900
on that side.
How fucking weird is so weird looking at

416
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,230
it looks wrong.
Yeah.

417
00:17:24,231 --> 00:17:26,180
Let me see two eyes on one side of their
head.

418
00:17:26,181 --> 00:17:29,240
Their bodies flattened out and it's full
of so much good meat.

419
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:30,320
Oh yeah.
Oh Man.

420
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:33,920
It's like as heavy and like my aunt and
uncle live on Kodiak island.

421
00:17:33,921 --> 00:17:37,160
We've been going up there since I was a
kid and I mean it's,

422
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:37,780
you know,
it's,

423
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,990
that's as much meat as a deer,
right?

424
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:43,190
You get to 200 pound halibut,
which isn't the most common.

425
00:17:43,191 --> 00:17:44,450
They can be way bigger than that too.

426
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,670
You're supposed to release the really
big ones though,

427
00:17:46,671 --> 00:17:47,750
right?
Don't they say that?

428
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,230
I Dunno.
Maybe I,

429
00:17:49,231 --> 00:17:50,220
yeah,
I'm not sure.

430
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,610
A friend of mine caught one and there
was apparently enormous and he was

431
00:17:53,611 --> 00:17:56,460
furious because the guide,
they went fishing with a guide.

432
00:17:56,461 --> 00:17:58,890
The guide cut the line because it was so
big.

433
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,270
Do you think he just couldn't get it in
the boat?

434
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:00,811
No,
no,

435
00:18:00,811 --> 00:18:01,531
no.
He said,

436
00:18:01,531 --> 00:18:03,600
look,
we got to let this go because it's a big

437
00:18:03,601 --> 00:18:04,710
breeder.
Oh.

438
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,770
And that these,
these big ones are responsible for

439
00:18:07,771 --> 00:18:10,710
keeping the populations healthy.
And because this guy made a living off

440
00:18:10,711 --> 00:18:11,760
of fishing,
he's like,

441
00:18:11,761 --> 00:18:13,230
it's our responsibility to cut the
sleeves.

442
00:18:13,231 --> 00:18:15,510
And the guy was like,
what are you talking about?

443
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,650
He's like,
this is like,

444
00:18:16,651 --> 00:18:18,600
he didn't know that that was going to be
an option.

445
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,630
Yeah.
And so he's pulling up this thing where

446
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,920
he described it as like the side of a
wall.

447
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,540
Oh yeah.
Like the wall of a room.

448
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:26,040
It's like,
it's fucking huge.

449
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,350
I don't know if it's true how,
but,

450
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,940
but I know other fish,
you know,

451
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,620
sometimes the big ones don't eat that
well.

452
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,990
You're just not sure.
It might not have been.

453
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,280
It's not like he's going to get that
mounted.

454
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:36,114
I doubt.
Right.

455
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,820
Like a 400 pounds.
They say that's true with deer too.

456
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:43,440
Like I've never eaten a really old deer,
but they say old deer just do not taste

457
00:18:43,441 --> 00:18:44,730
that good.
It can be it.

458
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:47,730
I know they can be worse for sure.
Shoot an old dough.

459
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,230
That was mo mo,
mo.

460
00:18:49,231 --> 00:18:50,330
That's right.
Yeah.

461
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,580
And he said it was rough.
I mean,

462
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:56,580
how did it change rooms over a winter?
But my little brother shot me a deer and

463
00:18:56,581 --> 00:19:01,581
gave it to me for Christmas and it was
the first slightly off tasting animal

464
00:19:02,281 --> 00:19:05,670
that I've tasted in man,
seven years,

465
00:19:05,671 --> 00:19:07,260
you know,
and I've been eating a lot of animals,

466
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,580
you know,
over my course of time.

467
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,500
Um,
you know,

468
00:19:10,501 --> 00:19:12,300
we're talking about media,
which I've worked on for a long time.

469
00:19:12,301 --> 00:19:13,660
I don't anymore,
but uh,

470
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:16,800
I a lot of animals and they all tasted
exceptionally good.

471
00:19:16,801 --> 00:19:20,430
And my brother shot this one and um,
I don't know what it was.

472
00:19:20,431 --> 00:19:23,310
It was cold.
He killed it.

473
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,980
Um,
and it got dark and he had to track it

474
00:19:25,981 --> 00:19:28,900
in early the next morning and it's,
um,

475
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,170
did he got shot it?
No,

476
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:31,981
no,
he hit it.

477
00:19:31,981 --> 00:19:33,090
Well it,
it,

478
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,860
it,
it died fairly close.

479
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,020
Um,
but then it was,

480
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,180
it was pretty gnarly and I even mean,
so I made sausage out of it and try to

481
00:19:40,181 --> 00:19:42,700
eat that and that was hard to get down.
We have a,

482
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,030
we have a couple pounds of it left
still.

483
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,650
It just wasn't good.
Hmm.

484
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:47,910
That's weird.
Well,

485
00:19:47,911 --> 00:19:49,830
maybe it was a tarsal glands or
something.

486
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:52,410
Like was it in the Rut?
No,

487
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:56,070
it was muzzleloader season in,
in December in Minnesota.

488
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:59,280
And uh,
I don't know what it was.

489
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,420
I really don't.
Yeah.

490
00:20:00,421 --> 00:20:02,250
Well you hear stories,
you know,

491
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,540
I,
I'll tell you what,

492
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:05,070
man,
that was one of the things that really

493
00:20:05,071 --> 00:20:06,960
got me into hunting,
not with just the,

494
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:11,430
how cool that trip was and how amazing
it was and how bizarre it is to be out

495
00:20:11,431 --> 00:20:12,720
there.
And total silence.

496
00:20:12,721 --> 00:20:14,680
No cell phone signal.
You don't hear.

497
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,910
Not What do we see?
Like maybe three people the whole week

498
00:20:17,911 --> 00:20:19,230
we were out there.
Yeah.

499
00:20:19,231 --> 00:20:20,070
Two boats,
maybe.

500
00:20:20,071 --> 00:20:23,760
I don't even remember seeing him.
I remember we saw a dude's tent and he

501
00:20:23,761 --> 00:20:26,220
had like a little a woodstove and I was
like,

502
00:20:26,221 --> 00:20:27,510
Steve,
we got to go the stove.

503
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,120
Fuck is this.
This guy's got a stove inside of his

504
00:20:30,121 --> 00:20:32,730
tent because he used to stay at warm and
his tent.

505
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:37,680
We were freezing our dicks off and then
we saw another guy who had a deer in his

506
00:20:37,681 --> 00:20:39,030
boat.
He had shot up.

507
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,140
Oh yeah.
Remember that guy?

508
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,820
Yeah.
That was a memorable meal,

509
00:20:41,821 --> 00:20:42,511
man.
Yeah,

510
00:20:42,511 --> 00:20:45,660
that was going to say the food was so
good.

511
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:48,070
Once we did shoot that deer and we

512
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,150
ate it that night,
it was like,

513
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:51,220
good Lord.
It's still,

514
00:20:51,221 --> 00:20:54,460
it's the best meat ever and pos,
there's so much connected to it,

515
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:56,080
you know?
It's not just that.

516
00:20:56,081 --> 00:20:58,600
It's like you went to a restaurant,
you had a delicious meal.

517
00:20:58,900 --> 00:20:59,381
It's like,
no,

518
00:20:59,381 --> 00:21:01,840
you like,
you busted your ass for five days

519
00:21:01,841 --> 00:21:06,340
humping over mountains.
Finally put a stock on a deer shot.

520
00:21:06,341 --> 00:21:09,250
The deer killed it,
dragged it back to camp,

521
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,350
cut it up,
butchered it,

522
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,500
and then we ate it.
And like,

523
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:16,030
and then when Steve took that dough head
and buried it underground because,

524
00:21:16,031 --> 00:21:17,860
uh,
what does that Guthrie Book?

525
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,030
A big sky.
Yeah.

526
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:20,980
Right.
It was in this book.

527
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,320
Yeah.
I think it's,

528
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:25,060
I think that's the name of it.
I think that's the name of the book.

529
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:30,190
Right.
And in that book he talks about cooking

530
00:21:30,191 --> 00:21:32,830
a deer head under the ground.
So Steve wanted to try it.

531
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,650
We soaked burlap sack I've ever,
it was incredible.

532
00:21:35,651 --> 00:21:37,300
It was really good.
It was incredible.

533
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:41,470
It was like some sort of exotic smoked
pork or something like that.

534
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,790
Yeah.
But then,

535
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,380
yeah,
we ate everything,

536
00:21:44,381 --> 00:21:45,700
man.
We ate the liver,

537
00:21:45,701 --> 00:21:47,050
we ate the heart.
We,

538
00:21:47,051 --> 00:21:49,210
when we ate it all,
it was amazing.

539
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:51,400
Do you still have a freezer full of meat
right now?

540
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,230
Shot an elk.
Nice.

541
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,550
In October.
So yeah.

542
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,010
And I,
I had shot a deer in November,

543
00:21:57,011 --> 00:21:58,770
but I ate that near pretty quick.
Yeah.

544
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:02,380
I had a doubt of the season last year
and this year for the first time.

545
00:22:02,381 --> 00:22:05,950
A long time.
I've been eating more local pork and

546
00:22:05,951 --> 00:22:07,780
beef and I'm just so sick of it,
man.

547
00:22:07,781 --> 00:22:11,560
I can't wait until this fall again.
And now when are you going back home?

548
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:13,700
Back home from here?
Yeah,

549
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,070
I'm going home.
Um,

550
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,170
a week from two weeks from yesterday.

551
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:19,120
I have two commercial freezers in the
back.

552
00:22:19,121 --> 00:22:20,270
I could hook you up.
Yeah,

553
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:21,700
yeah.
I'm going to turn it down.

554
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:25,630
How could you get it back?
Um,

555
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:26,680
let me think about it.
I can,

556
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:29,350
I can go buy cooler stuff.
Go buy a small Yeti or figure something

557
00:22:29,351 --> 00:22:32,190
out and get you some,
I have one of those Yeti hoppers at home

558
00:22:32,191 --> 00:22:34,660
I could give you that.
That makes me really proud that like,

559
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,610
you know,
I was there the first time you hunted,

560
00:22:36,611 --> 00:22:39,820
now you're going to hook me up with me.
That's good stuff.

561
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:42,730
I live off it now.
I don't buy meat anymore unless I go to

562
00:22:42,731 --> 00:22:45,700
a restaurant.
It's very rare that I go to a store like

563
00:22:45,701 --> 00:22:49,270
a butcher shop and buy meat unless
there's something I'm preparing,

564
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,640
it's just not as good.
It's just actually not as good.

565
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:54,550
Well or I find that it's,
it's different.

566
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,310
It tastes like a soft,
lazy animal.

567
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,940
It's weird like when you eat a steak,
like from a butcher shop,

568
00:23:00,941 --> 00:23:02,980
I mean they taste good,
they still taste good,

569
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:06,820
but it tastes like,
like this soft almost sick thing.

570
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,110
Like there's a difference.
Chink,

571
00:23:08,111 --> 00:23:10,780
grass fed beef.
And that's one of the things that I

572
00:23:10,781 --> 00:23:14,650
noticed like way back in the day when I
first started learning about grass fed

573
00:23:14,651 --> 00:23:15,131
beef,
I'm like,

574
00:23:15,131 --> 00:23:16,060
well,
what is the difference?

575
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,500
And people explain to you,
oh,

576
00:23:17,501 --> 00:23:19,870
there's a difference in the fatty acids
and what's,

577
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:23,080
what's healthier about it is these
animals are not supposed to be eating

578
00:23:23,081 --> 00:23:24,370
grain.
And when they eat grain,

579
00:23:24,371 --> 00:23:26,170
it's bad for their body.
And that's why they're so fat.

580
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:29,140
And the marbling is actually them being
incredibly unhealthy and like,

581
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:30,250
Huh,
okay,

582
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,800
so I'm gonna try some grass fed meat.
And it was so expensive.

583
00:23:32,801 --> 00:23:34,990
And then it was a small,
like they're smaller,

584
00:23:34,991 --> 00:23:36,940
like the stakes are small and it's a
darker meat.

585
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:37,773
I'm like,
hmm.

586
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:39,580
And then I remember eating it thinking,
wow,

587
00:23:39,581 --> 00:23:41,360
this tastes really different.
Yeah,

588
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:44,350
it does.
Like a grass fed steak tastes different

589
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:46,730
than a grain fed steak.
They look different when you lay them

590
00:23:46,731 --> 00:23:48,090
out side by side.
Oh yeah.

591
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:52,130
But then you take those and then you put
an elk stake next to it and you go,

592
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:55,010
okay,
that's the real meat man.

593
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,300
That's what you're supposed to be
eating.

594
00:23:56,301 --> 00:24:00,290
You're supposed to be in that deep,
dark red meat that you eat it and you

595
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:03,650
just want to run through a fucking wall.
It's like it's got energy in it.

596
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:06,350
Like it it fee.
It makes your body feel different when

597
00:24:06,351 --> 00:24:07,400
you eat it.
So what is it?

598
00:24:07,401 --> 00:24:08,770
What do you think that is?
What is,

599
00:24:08,771 --> 00:24:10,970
is that,
is that a a psychological thing?

600
00:24:10,971 --> 00:24:14,090
Do you think that it's actually
biological in the meat?

601
00:24:14,091 --> 00:24:14,720
It is better.

602
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,360
There's something in there and more for
you.

603
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,930
How do you,
how do you make sense of that for

604
00:24:17,931 --> 00:24:21,410
yourself?
I have a terrible unscientific theory

605
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:25,580
and my unscientific theory is things
that run fast or better for you.

606
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:29,100
That's why fish is really good for you
cause it's hard to catch and they've,

607
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,880
they've swim fast.
Deer are great.

608
00:24:31,881 --> 00:24:34,160
They run fast,
rabbits are great.

609
00:24:34,161 --> 00:24:37,880
They run fast.
Cows just sort of wander around,

610
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:41,000
you know,
that just meandering and slow theory.

611
00:24:41,001 --> 00:24:44,570
But it makes sense that we have more
cows cause I guess it's just all right

612
00:24:44,571 --> 00:24:48,750
there corral those bitches.
Well you know my buddy Adam lives in uh,

613
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:52,430
Australia,
Adam Green tree and in Australia they

614
00:24:52,431 --> 00:24:57,431
have wild cows where cows at one time
were domestic but they broke loose and

615
00:24:58,221 --> 00:24:59,480
they've been for many,
many,

616
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:03,890
many generations living wild and they're
extremely dangerous.

617
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:05,510
Yeah.
Especially the bowls.

618
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:09,080
Like when you watch cowboys riding bowls
and you're like,

619
00:25:09,081 --> 00:25:09,920
wow,
this is crazy.

620
00:25:09,921 --> 00:25:10,960
We were like,
yeah,

621
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:14,990
that's a fucking big scary animal.
But again,

622
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:18,710
a domestic animal that is not fighting
off predators.

623
00:25:18,711 --> 00:25:19,850
It's not,
I mean it's just,

624
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:23,720
it doesn't want you to fuck with it.
It's got these giant watermelon

625
00:25:23,721 --> 00:25:28,721
testicles and they're just full of piss
and vinegar and that we don't eat those.

626
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:33,020
If Pete for people don't know,
when you buy meat from a cow,

627
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:36,570
you're buying meat from a steer and want
to steer is a bold.

628
00:25:36,571 --> 00:25:40,100
It cut his balls off and he's young.
So his testosterone stops.

629
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:42,770
So there's bodies mushy and soft.
Yeah.

630
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:47,800
But these bulls that Adam sees out in
the bush in Australia are super

631
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:53,780
aggressive and very dangerous and one of
his friends was torn apart by Juan Gord,

632
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,180
like really badly.
No,

633
00:25:55,181 --> 00:25:58,030
they lived,
but they had a med vac to safety at

634
00:25:58,031 --> 00:25:59,950
tours,
guts open and you know,

635
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,580
he was,
I don't even think he was hunting it.

636
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:03,950
I think like he was just in the wrong
place.

637
00:26:03,951 --> 00:26:06,140
The wrong time.
They see you and they just fucking

638
00:26:06,141 --> 00:26:06,974
charge.
Yeah.

639
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:09,080
It means a reason why they have those
goddamn giant horns.

640
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:10,610
Yeah.
What's the saying that uh,

641
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:13,610
you cut,
you cut into a male animals balls off

642
00:26:13,611 --> 00:26:17,210
and they stop thinking about ass and
start thinking about grass.

643
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,400
So it's literal.
Yeah.

644
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:21,890
They stopped trying to get laid and they
just eat,

645
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:25,820
they just keep eating and they just,
the lack of testosterone make some soft

646
00:26:25,821 --> 00:26:30,080
and mushy.
Whereas I'm Cam Haynes shot of water

647
00:26:30,081 --> 00:26:35,081
buffalo in Australia and he said that he
had one piece of meat in his mouth for

648
00:26:35,901 --> 00:26:40,340
half an hour trying to chew it down
while he was practicing archery.

649
00:26:40,341 --> 00:26:41,810
He goes,
I'm not exaggerating.

650
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,820
Chewed piece of meat for a whole half
hour.

651
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:47,610
Yeah.
What's it say about us though?

652
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:52,500
Are as as humans though.
I mean you could easily make an analogy

653
00:26:52,501 --> 00:26:55,980
there between cows and then a wild
animal and us.

654
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:58,230
I mean nobody's more domesticated than
us.

655
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,910
No.
These things we domesticate.

656
00:26:59,911 --> 00:27:03,060
I think we are,
you know where the domestic cater

657
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,650
somehow,
but I think we're even more

658
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:07,500
domesticated.
Like if you could eat one of the duck

659
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:10,010
dynasty guys.
Oh Man,

660
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:15,020
they would cook up good.
Oh Oh mushy.

661
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,690
And
you know there would be so much

662
00:27:18,691 --> 00:27:22,290
flavoring and marbling and plus they
probably eat a lot of sugar.

663
00:27:22,291 --> 00:27:24,780
So there's probably like a lot of like
sweetness to the meat.

664
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,310
Yeah,
I'm not advocating,

665
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,760
it depends on what your tooth is though.
If you're used to eating wild animals

666
00:27:29,761 --> 00:27:32,160
and eight one of the duck dynasty guys
would taste like shit.

667
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:33,720
That's true.
That's true.

668
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:36,480
But if you eat McDonald's and ring
dings,

669
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:38,070
what's,
what's the ring thing?

670
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,380
Look,
you're one of those little hostess

671
00:27:40,381 --> 00:27:42,330
things.
So chocolate covered,

672
00:27:42,331 --> 00:27:46,680
cream filled jammies.
I might have to get one of those.

673
00:27:46,681 --> 00:27:49,040
I haven't had them on those disgusting.
They look great.

674
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:49,320
Like,
Oh,

675
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,360
who is it going to enjoy this?
And then as soon as you eat it,

676
00:27:51,361 --> 00:27:53,130
you're like,
what the fuck is wrong with me,

677
00:27:53,131 --> 00:27:54,320
man?
Yeah.

678
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:57,570
I love just,
I had some tacos.

679
00:27:57,571 --> 00:28:00,630
I got to town last night and uh,
had to go to the first Taqueria.

680
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:04,050
I saw it was the best.
We have legit Mexican food in La.

681
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,080
The Montessori does not have next,
not really right.

682
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:10,530
Not such good Mexican food,
but Colorado has some really good

683
00:28:10,531 --> 00:28:11,670
Mexican food.
It does.

684
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:12,630
It does.
Yeah.

685
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:13,620
It,
the,

686
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,780
the line of that I think stops at
Colorado.

687
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:17,970
Maybe why I'm going,
I don't think has it been north into

688
00:28:17,971 --> 00:28:18,661
Montana?
You're,

689
00:28:18,661 --> 00:28:22,020
you're in a dead zone where you are is
amazing though.

690
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:24,750
It's worth it.
You could take a trip for Mexican food

691
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,490
because where you are,
it's like,

692
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,473
I feel like,
I mean,

693
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:30,810
I almost feel like I shouldn't say this
on the podcast because I don't want

694
00:28:30,811 --> 00:28:34,560
anybody moving to Bozeman is already on
her foot to list.

695
00:28:34,561 --> 00:28:36,690
It's everybody.
I mean it's the cat's out of the bag.

696
00:28:36,691 --> 00:28:38,640
It's not,
you're making sure you're not spilling

697
00:28:38,641 --> 00:28:40,020
the beans here.
I know,

698
00:28:40,021 --> 00:28:42,390
but I mean,
it really is a special place.

699
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,100
It's the people are so nice.
Yeah.

700
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:48,570
They're not dumb either.
It's not like uneducated.

701
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:48,811
No,
no,

702
00:28:48,811 --> 00:28:50,670
no.
It's actually that county has the

703
00:28:50,671 --> 00:28:55,560
highest percentage of phds in America.
What bozeman really nail.

704
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:56,640
Look it up.
Fact.

705
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:57,900
Wow.
Yeah.

706
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:02,250
It's a highly educated population,
but it's also not like boulder where

707
00:29:02,251 --> 00:29:04,260
they're like,
or my God save the butterfly.

708
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,080
You know,
there are no national about their

709
00:29:07,081 --> 00:29:09,030
approach to nature.
It's balanced.

710
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,140
You can find some,
you know,

711
00:29:11,141 --> 00:29:13,230
you can find good yoga,
you can find your boob and stuff,

712
00:29:13,231 --> 00:29:15,000
but there's also a rancher right next to
you.

713
00:29:15,001 --> 00:29:18,160
It's really interestingly like diverse
troll.

714
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:18,760
Yeah,
it is.

715
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,220
Yeah.
It's diverse some ways.

716
00:29:20,221 --> 00:29:22,370
Not with mostly white.
Yeah.

717
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,233
No.

718
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:26,640
Moving there from New York and,
and uh,

719
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:31,440
that is my least favorite thing about,
about Montana and not a whole lot of

720
00:29:31,441 --> 00:29:32,274
flavor.
No,

721
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,930
but there's so many good things about,
and the,

722
00:29:35,931 --> 00:29:38,820
the landscape,
like what you get to see when you're

723
00:29:38,821 --> 00:29:40,020
there.
So stunning.

724
00:29:40,021 --> 00:29:42,910
And the access to the is the huge,
it's a huge thing too.

725
00:29:42,911 --> 00:29:45,400
I mean,
I'm in Bozeman from my house in,

726
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,760
I don't know how many fin fought four
different directions,

727
00:29:48,761 --> 00:29:52,600
three different directions.
You can be at a trail in 15 minutes and

728
00:29:52,601 --> 00:29:54,070
it's just,
and it's just endless.

729
00:29:54,071 --> 00:29:55,430
You know,
you can get on a trail ride side of,

730
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:59,020
Oh man,
I can't talk right outside of Bozeman.

731
00:29:59,021 --> 00:30:04,021
And you can go if you wanted to for days
through the yellowstone ecosystem south.

732
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,770
Yeah.
And just keep going and keep going and

733
00:30:05,771 --> 00:30:06,700
keep going.
I mean it,

734
00:30:06,701 --> 00:30:10,900
it connects you to,
I mean real big wilderness,

735
00:30:10,901 --> 00:30:12,160
the kind,
the kind that you can,

736
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,710
I mean in Alaska you find it even
bigger,

737
00:30:14,711 --> 00:30:18,430
but I think in the lower 48 yeah,
it's unparalleled.

738
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:22,150
Man in the lower 48 is about,
it's about as wild as it gets.

739
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:25,960
And that leads me to what I wanted to
bring up to you today because I saw this

740
00:30:25,961 --> 00:30:30,160
today where trump is his,
his challenging some of the protection

741
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:33,560
of certain national monuments and some
public lands today.

742
00:30:33,561 --> 00:30:36,730
It was something that came out and like
I told you fuckers,

743
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,430
I knew this was coming and there were so
many people that were telling me that

744
00:30:39,431 --> 00:30:42,850
trump is going to protect our public
lands because his son is a hunter and

745
00:30:42,851 --> 00:30:44,140
like,
listen man,

746
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:49,170
that guy worships money.
There's money to be made in delisting

747
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:52,150
these public.
Look at this trump order could roll back

748
00:30:52,151 --> 00:30:54,460
public land protections from three
presidents.

749
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:58,270
This is going to have a shit storm on
his hands though may play there so we

750
00:30:58,271 --> 00:31:03,271
could hear exactly what he says of
America's natural ratio sis

751
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:07,280
and I can tell you the group that's in
here right now,

752
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:09,860
they're really doing the job.
Rightly said,

753
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:11,480
they doing a good job.
No,

754
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,880
we're going to take care of Alaska too.
Don't worry about it.

755
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:21,950
And they protect the ability of the
people to access and utilize the land

756
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:27,460
which truly belongs to them and belongs
to all of us.

757
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:33,670
Secretary Ryan Zinky is doing an
incredible job and he never overlooks

758
00:31:37,671 --> 00:31:39,650
the details.
He's a detailed person.

759
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:44,480
Soon after he was confirmed,
we had a snow storm,

760
00:31:44,481 --> 00:31:48,740
big one,
and he was out there on the steps of the

761
00:31:48,741 --> 00:31:53,741
Lincoln memorial shoveling the snow all
by himself.

762
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,270
And he's a strong guy.
He did a good job.

763
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,160
Part the fuck am I.
Very,

764
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:02,120
very good job.
Proud of heard the first 100 days we've

765
00:32:02,121 --> 00:32:06,920
taken historic action to eliminate
wasteful regulations.

766
00:32:06,921 --> 00:32:10,460
They're being eliminated like nobody's
ever seen before.

767
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:14,840
There's never been anything like it.
Sometimes I look at some of the things

768
00:32:14,841 --> 00:32:16,880
I'm signing,
I say maybe people won't like it,

769
00:32:16,881 --> 00:32:18,080
but I'm doing the right thing.

770
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:23,510
What the hell?
This is so weird that that's a

771
00:32:23,511 --> 00:32:26,030
president.
But the way he communicates,

772
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:28,880
did you see when he,
he just pinned a purple heart?

773
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:33,440
Jesus.
He just pinned a purple heart on,

774
00:32:33,441 --> 00:32:35,990
on a return vet.
I got lost.

775
00:32:35,991 --> 00:32:37,640
His leg just happened last couple of
days.

776
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:40,160
It's the most awkward and weirdest.
It is

777
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:43,910
the weirdest single thing I've ever
watched on a screen.

778
00:32:43,911 --> 00:32:45,980
His,
his body language and his,

779
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,990
uh,
what he does.

780
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:51,350
It's bizarre.
Really Bizarre.

781
00:32:51,351 --> 00:32:51,740
And what does it

782
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:56,060
say there in terms of like what the uh,
actual rollbacks mean and what the,

783
00:32:56,061 --> 00:32:58,940
the issue is
here.

784
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:01,190
Let's go largely ignored order,
which trump sign.

785
00:33:01,191 --> 00:33:04,520
The interior department could lead to
the reshaping of 24 national monuments,

786
00:33:04,521 --> 00:33:07,430
including the Grand Canyon Parish
Shan't,

787
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:12,460
national monument,
Grand Staircase Escalante National

788
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,360
Monument,
and the Bass and range national monument

789
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:16,640
as well as the host of Pacific Ocean
monuments,

790
00:33:16,641 --> 00:33:21,200
including the World War II valor in the
Pacific National Monument though

791
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:25,250
Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke,
he cast the move as a way to include

792
00:33:25,251 --> 00:33:27,950
local voices in the decision to
designate monuments.

793
00:33:27,951 --> 00:33:32,480
The review of the antiquities act,
which is the first signed by President

794
00:33:32,481 --> 00:33:37,481
Teddy Roosevelt in 1906 stands in stark
relief two years of bipartisan work at

795
00:33:38,331 --> 00:33:39,890
conserving lands.
Wow.

796
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:43,160
The move comes after Western Republican
lawmakers,

797
00:33:43,161 --> 00:33:48,140
including Utah Senator Orrin Hatch
complained that Obama overused the law

798
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:52,160
to overprotect land.
How the fuck do you overprotect land?

799
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:54,490
It kind of protected,
but don't overprotect it,

800
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,510
but I don't know,
man.

801
00:33:56,511 --> 00:33:56,910
It's history

802
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:59,940
weird.
The worry is going to be that this would

803
00:33:59,941 --> 00:34:02,090
be in the beginning of a,
of a larger pattern.

804
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:03,990
It's a slippery slope.
Well,

805
00:34:03,991 --> 00:34:04,824
I,
what I wanted to,

806
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:08,680
you know about,
and what I think most people don't,

807
00:34:08,681 --> 00:34:11,350
when you talk about this,
the vast majority of the people in this

808
00:34:11,351 --> 00:34:16,351
country live in these communities and
cities and towns and you know,

809
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:21,820
even small towns they do,
they don't understand how much of this

810
00:34:21,821 --> 00:34:24,670
land that we live in is just this
incredible,

811
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,740
bizarre,
uh,

812
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:30,490
experiment in like the people having
the,

813
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:35,530
the actual American people owning this
incredible swath of public land.

814
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:37,923
I mean,
it's,

815
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:39,610
it's wild.
Like what you're talking about.

816
00:34:39,611 --> 00:34:42,230
Like you can walk for days and days into
that.

817
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,310
Yeah.
I think they don't know that exists

818
00:34:44,311 --> 00:34:46,290
necessarily.
And I think even to me,

819
00:34:46,291 --> 00:34:49,080
more importantly,
they don't understand the impact that

820
00:34:49,081 --> 00:34:54,081
that actually has on people and what it
actually means to be able to be part of

821
00:34:54,121 --> 00:34:55,100
something like that.
It's,

822
00:34:55,101 --> 00:34:56,730
it's a really deep,
important thing.

823
00:34:56,731 --> 00:34:58,920
And I think that people just,
you know,

824
00:34:58,921 --> 00:35:01,590
you get your postcard tourists and you
say,

825
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:02,730
Oh,
I love the national forest.

826
00:35:02,731 --> 00:35:05,280
I love the national parks and let's
drive around and take pictures.

827
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:06,540
And that's great.
That's fine.

828
00:35:06,541 --> 00:35:10,740
There's a big industry there.
It's very helpful to the economy and uh,

829
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:13,370
but there's something way deeper to
that.

830
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:15,200
Brings a lot of people.
Um,

831
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:19,200
and I will even say culturally,
something really deep there that we

832
00:35:19,201 --> 00:35:20,550
shouldn't be fucking with.
No.

833
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,150
You just shouldn't be messing with it.
Well,

834
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:25,980
it's been there for a hundred years,
110 years.

835
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:28,440
It's the conservation part of it.

836
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,273
Yeah,
absolutely.

837
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:32,700
But the land itself has been there way
longer and that's,

838
00:35:32,701 --> 00:35:34,470
you know,
sort of like the deep time.

839
00:35:34,471 --> 00:35:36,510
Part of that is what really interests me
is because,

840
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:39,030
you know,
step out into that in the right context

841
00:35:39,031 --> 00:35:40,140
and,
and you're all of a sudden,

842
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:41,550
you know,
you're,

843
00:35:41,551 --> 00:35:44,190
uh,
you're playing with something way bigger

844
00:35:44,191 --> 00:35:47,880
and more powerful and more impactful by
just being part of the landscape that,

845
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:49,980
you know,
but you're right.

846
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:50,411
Yeah.
The,

847
00:35:50,411 --> 00:35:53,040
the conservation thing is present and
real.

848
00:35:53,041 --> 00:35:53,670
And,
uh,

849
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:55,710
the,
I grew up in Minnesota and North Dakota

850
00:35:55,711 --> 00:35:57,990
and my,
my first wilderness trip was in the

851
00:35:57,991 --> 00:36:01,620
boundary waters of northern Minnesota.
It's this million 8 million Acre

852
00:36:01,621 --> 00:36:04,800
wilderness of lakes that are
interconnected by trails and you can go

853
00:36:04,801 --> 00:36:08,700
out for weeks at a time and canoe across
the lake and then carry your boat to the

854
00:36:08,701 --> 00:36:10,620
next lake.
And there's camp sites and it's just,

855
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:14,160
it's paradise.
It's where I fell in love with the idea

856
00:36:14,161 --> 00:36:16,590
of wilderness.
It's actually where I fell in love with

857
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:18,560
my,
for the first lady that fell in love at

858
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:20,220
the same,
I was on a church trip.

859
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,750
Oh No.
Yeah.

860
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:24,720
And uh,
but you know,

861
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:26,580
so what I,
you know what I'm saying as far as it's

862
00:36:26,581 --> 00:36:30,060
shaping people and its importance.
I mean that's first trip into the

863
00:36:30,061 --> 00:36:31,470
wilderness changed my life.
Like,

864
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:34,140
and that's a,
that's a pretty mild way of saying it.

865
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:34,920
It,
it,

866
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,710
it shaped who I am all the way.

867
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:40,600
Well that gets us to what you're doing
now because you,

868
00:36:40,601 --> 00:36:45,130
you stop working for 0.0 and we talked
about on the last podcast that you had

869
00:36:45,131 --> 00:36:49,720
done a lot of these wilderness therapy
trips where you'd take like troubled

870
00:36:49,721 --> 00:36:53,440
kids that have lost their way and their
parents don't know what the fuck to do

871
00:36:53,441 --> 00:36:56,350
and you would take them out into the
woods and live with these kids for

872
00:36:56,351 --> 00:36:57,310
months.
Yeah.

873
00:36:57,311 --> 00:36:58,580
For a long time.
Yeah.

874
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:03,280
Just crazy to think about like that,
but make sense.

875
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:07,330
Like just the five days that I was out
there six days or whatever,

876
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:12,040
when I first went to Montana with you
guys changed the way I thought about

877
00:37:12,041 --> 00:37:14,200
wilderness cause I really had never
been,

878
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:18,520
I mean I'd kind of been to like wooded
areas.

879
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:19,780
Right.
You know what I'm saying?

880
00:37:19,781 --> 00:37:22,300
But I maybe I went to yellowstone,
I was a kid,

881
00:37:22,301 --> 00:37:23,360
but I didn't really remember it.

882
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:26,000
It's a different thing man.
And then we went to Alaska.

883
00:37:26,001 --> 00:37:26,960
Right.
And that was,

884
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:29,080
to me,
that's another level of which it was

885
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:30,980
listened to you on that trip.
You were like,

886
00:37:30,981 --> 00:37:32,950
fuck that place,
we shouldn't go to that place.

887
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,820
Sure.
It was uncomfortable.

888
00:37:34,821 --> 00:37:38,810
But um,
I'm glad we went though in retrospect.

889
00:37:38,811 --> 00:37:39,261
Right.
I mean,

890
00:37:39,261 --> 00:37:43,850
and I'm glad you went just because of
the level of how deep out we are.

891
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:45,191
You know,
the,

892
00:37:45,191 --> 00:37:46,610
the,
the Missouri Breaks in Montana,

893
00:37:46,611 --> 00:37:50,480
you're out there,
but in this spot and in southeast

894
00:37:50,481 --> 00:37:52,250
Alaska,
we were really out there and you can

895
00:37:52,251 --> 00:37:53,120
feel in the air

896
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:57,910
fell.
I fell off of this like six foot drop.

897
00:37:57,911 --> 00:38:01,840
I slept and just,
and luckily I just landed good.

898
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:03,370
But I was like,
man,

899
00:38:03,371 --> 00:38:06,790
you could fuck yourself up up here and
not be able to get out of here.

900
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,320
Like,
especially if you do a solo trip.

901
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,340
Oh yeah.
No Bueno.

902
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:11,960
No,
totally.

903
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:12,793
Yeah.
Yeah.

904
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,750
I'm addicted to that.
That feeling.

905
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:16,940
Yeah,
that sort of immense.

906
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,950
Kenny,
it takes you over.

907
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:21,560
You are so tiny.
You are not,

908
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,330
you know,
you're not in charge anymore.

909
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:24,890
It doesn't care about you.

910
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:27,730
That's the thing.
Like the thing about like Prince of

911
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:31,030
Wales is this solitude,
this sadness.

912
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:33,220
That's beautiful.
It's really weird.

913
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:35,760
It's a weird feeling that you get,
you just like it.

914
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:40,210
There's no denying your lack of
significance in this particular

915
00:38:40,211 --> 00:38:42,130
environment.
It doesn't give a fuck about your credit

916
00:38:42,131 --> 00:38:44,590
cards now.
It doesn't care if like cell phone,

917
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:48,160
it doesn't care who you know or where
you live or what kind of car each,

918
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:49,790
it doesn't give a fuck.
Yeah.

919
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:55,050
It's just tooth than Fang and claw and
rain and constant rain and beauty.

920
00:38:56,530 --> 00:39:01,030
Just unbelievable beauty with the,
like when the sun does color coaster.

921
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:03,460
Oh yeah.
I mean you're just in hell and all of a

922
00:39:03,461 --> 00:39:05,040
sudden you're on the top of a ridge and,
and the,

923
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:07,360
and the,
and the sun peaks out in a rainbow pops

924
00:39:07,361 --> 00:39:10,210
up and the like the technicolor hyper
vivid,

925
00:39:10,211 --> 00:39:13,850
just like crazy green.
It's a,

926
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:16,090
sorry about that.
I have cold,

927
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:19,780
uh,
that place as a personality.

928
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:20,683
Yeah.
Right.

929
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:23,620
But being in wilderness,
I've been in wilderness spots all over

930
00:39:23,621 --> 00:39:24,370
the globe.

931
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:28,520
It's what's so fascinating to me is how
they all have a different vibe.

932
00:39:28,521 --> 00:39:30,630
They'll have a different like life.
And it is,

933
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,331
it's,
it's like,

934
00:39:31,331 --> 00:39:31,991
uh,
I mean,

935
00:39:31,991 --> 00:39:33,880
sure it looks different,
but there's a,

936
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:37,540
like a felt sense or a feeling you get
from places like the Brooks range in

937
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:42,220
Alaska is the northern most range of
mountains and it runs east and west.

938
00:39:42,221 --> 00:39:44,980
And then above it is the Arctic,
the Arctic plane,

939
00:39:44,981 --> 00:39:48,670
and an Arctic Ocean.
There is something about being up there.

940
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:52,420
And especially I think in the summer
when the sun doesn't really go down.

941
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,280
It is,
it is,

942
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:56,740
it feels like being on a different
planet.

943
00:39:56,830 --> 00:39:59,590
But man,
I don't know if I have the worst to

944
00:39:59,591 --> 00:40:01,210
describe it,
but yeah,

945
00:40:01,211 --> 00:40:02,170
man,
I mean,

946
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:04,090
and that's what I said.
I'm addicted to.

947
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,320
I am.
And I,

948
00:40:05,321 --> 00:40:07,960
you know,
I moved to Montana for professional

949
00:40:07,961 --> 00:40:09,610
reasons,
but then also because it's where I

950
00:40:09,611 --> 00:40:10,270
wanted to live.

951
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:12,700
And so I get out hiking all the time,
you know,

952
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:13,900
I train,
I hike with,

953
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,980
that's Kinda how I stay fit.
Um,

954
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:20,740
but I come,
I need to figure this out because I come

955
00:40:20,741 --> 00:40:25,741
home from that feeling like I just like
got started.

956
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:29,320
You know,
I've missed the deep immersion of the

957
00:40:29,321 --> 00:40:33,310
woods when you were working for meat
eater and you constantly on those trips

958
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:36,850
or any time that I spent over,
I think there's something that happens

959
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:38,050
after,
you know,

960
00:40:38,051 --> 00:40:40,810
depending on how long,
the longest I've stayed out at a time is

961
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:43,580
a 40 some days.
Um,

962
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,940
but there's some that happens,
I don't know,

963
00:40:45,941 --> 00:40:47,140
a day,
two days,

964
00:40:47,141 --> 00:40:49,480
three days,
five days in where you really just kind

965
00:40:49,481 --> 00:40:52,030
of let go of the regular,
you know,

966
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:53,950
I don't know.
I think he's actually physiological,

967
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:55,210
some of it,
but whatever.

968
00:40:55,211 --> 00:40:58,630
It could be just psychological too,
but something shifts,

969
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:00,730
you know,
when you do a real expedition,

970
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:03,040
when you do a real thing where you're
not,

971
00:41:03,041 --> 00:41:05,800
your brain's not half stuck back in all
the other stuff.

972
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,170
So yeah,
I go hiking and I love it,

973
00:41:08,171 --> 00:41:10,090
you know,
all the time and we get out in the

974
00:41:10,091 --> 00:41:12,190
woods,
but it just doesn't really do it for me.

975
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:15,340
I feel kind of unfulfilled.
That's interesting.

976
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:18,490
So you,
you just got so addicted to being out

977
00:41:18,491 --> 00:41:20,820
there,
completely disconnected that you,

978
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:22,210
when you go on the hike,
you know,

979
00:41:22,211 --> 00:41:24,670
you could always just make it back to
town a couple hours.

980
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:26,140
Oh yeah.
It's just like a little,

981
00:41:26,141 --> 00:41:30,400
I'm trying to think of like an analogy,
but it would be like a little taste.

982
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:33,410
Yeah.
It would be like maybe like a five

983
00:41:33,411 --> 00:41:34,190
minute

984
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:39,050
porn session versus a week long like
lovemaking session that of your dreams,

985
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:40,520
right?
Just like a little,

986
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:41,610
uh,
yeah,

987
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:43,370
a little teaser,
just not as fun.

988
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:45,890
Do you,
do you plan on staying there?

989
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,930
Is that,
I think so.

990
00:41:47,931 --> 00:41:50,570
Yeah.
I mean we think about we definitely

991
00:41:50,571 --> 00:41:53,450
won't move back east.
We would either move somewhere out here

992
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:55,970
or stay there.
It gets cold as fuck in the winter

993
00:41:55,971 --> 00:41:56,630
though,
right?

994
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:57,920
It does.
Yeah.

995
00:41:57,921 --> 00:42:00,080
Not,
not that call to action.

996
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:01,820
Like not compared to where I grew up in
Minnesota.

997
00:42:01,821 --> 00:42:04,930
It gets really cold for a long time and
Montana where we're at.

998
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:06,550
I used to do that,
but uh,

999
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,670
global warming,
something,

1000
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:11,740
something it's different this year was
pretty mild.

1001
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:13,850
The year before was really,
really mild.

1002
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:16,070
You know,
like 35 average temperature.

1003
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,300
Really?
That's it.

1004
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:18,680
Yeah.
It's not that bad.

1005
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:21,470
I thought it was like 35 below.
No,

1006
00:42:21,471 --> 00:42:24,470
you go northern Montana up in the
highline area.

1007
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:25,820
It'll start to,
you know,

1008
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:28,970
more of a deep freeze.
A lot more wind is kind of a nice little

1009
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:31,310
protected.
We should stop talking about Bozeman so

1010
00:42:31,311 --> 00:42:34,760
people hear me telling you we're going
to get people into it.

1011
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:37,430
It's um,
well just another factor and that it is

1012
00:42:37,431 --> 00:42:39,560
the,
I think the third fastest growing county

1013
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:41,360
in the states right now.
Wow.

1014
00:42:41,361 --> 00:42:43,010
So,
well it makes sense.

1015
00:42:43,011 --> 00:42:44,810
When I was there,
we went there,

1016
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:47,360
took the family in there last summer.
I was like,

1017
00:42:47,361 --> 00:42:49,490
this place is magic.
So pretty.

1018
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,770
I got a couple of other spots though
that saving.

1019
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:53,090
Oh yeah.
Don't tell anybody.

1020
00:42:53,091 --> 00:42:53,460
No,
I'm not.

1021
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:55,280
Gonna um,
when you were in the brooks range,

1022
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:57,920
did you put a like masks on to go to
sleep?

1023
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:58,440
Those,
you know,

1024
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,840
sleeping masks,
they say,

1025
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:02,510
yeah,
I just use a tee shirt.

1026
00:43:02,511 --> 00:43:03,530
Just cover your eyes.
Yeah.

1027
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:05,210
Yeah.
They say you have to because if you just

1028
00:43:05,211 --> 00:43:07,640
try to like sleep,
you'll wake up a couple hours later and

1029
00:43:07,641 --> 00:43:08,474
be all be welded.

1030
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:09,411
Oh yeah,
no,

1031
00:43:09,411 --> 00:43:10,640
it's weird.
It's weird.

1032
00:43:10,641 --> 00:43:11,660
It's cool.
It's cool.

1033
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:14,390
It's a very,
it's a perception changing thing to go

1034
00:43:14,391 --> 00:43:17,060
up there and watch the sun literally
just kind of like,

1035
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:19,580
you know,
kiss the horizon and then just keep

1036
00:43:19,581 --> 00:43:20,420
going.
And Yeah.

1037
00:43:20,421 --> 00:43:23,690
I went to anchorage couple of years ago
in the summer,

1038
00:43:23,691 --> 00:43:26,360
we were there in July.
Me and my friend Ari went fishing up

1039
00:43:26,361 --> 00:43:29,150
there and we did some shows up there and
uh,

1040
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:30,710
it was weird.
It's like two o'clock in the morning,

1041
00:43:30,711 --> 00:43:31,610
it was a light out.
And we're like,

1042
00:43:31,611 --> 00:43:36,050
what in the fuck is this like and that
people are coolish shit.

1043
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:39,470
That's another place.
There's something about like those

1044
00:43:39,471 --> 00:43:44,090
people like Alaska even more extreme
because something about those people

1045
00:43:44,091 --> 00:43:49,091
that they deal with nature in a way that
everybody else just doesn't.

1046
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:50,690
Oh yeah.
Well they have,

1047
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:51,830
yeah,
all the time.

1048
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:53,330
Whether it's gnarly.

1049
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:55,280
I mean,
you can't walk out your house for more

1050
00:43:55,281 --> 00:43:56,890
than 10 miles before you have it,
you know,

1051
00:43:57,050 --> 00:43:59,550
giant,
massive in front of you peak.

1052
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:01,190
The ocean's right there.
Yeah,

1053
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,300
yeah,
yeah.

1054
00:44:02,301 --> 00:44:05,090
I mean anchorage is a,
it's a weird place too.

1055
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,080
I love it.
Yeah.

1056
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:09,890
It's really interesting too because you
think of it as like a bunch of like

1057
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:14,750
lumberjacks and fishermen and Weirdos
and like people trying to run from the

1058
00:44:14,751 --> 00:44:17,300
law or something like that and you get
there and there was like honk free

1059
00:44:17,301 --> 00:44:18,890
quality.
There's a bunch of people with gay

1060
00:44:18,891 --> 00:44:21,260
rights signs.
People beeping their horns as they drove

1061
00:44:21,261 --> 00:44:21,710
by.
I'm like,

1062
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:23,480
oh,
this is not what you think it is.

1063
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:26,600
Craft breweries and really good
restaurants.

1064
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:27,710
Like,
oh,

1065
00:44:27,711 --> 00:44:28,610
okay,
this is,

1066
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:30,830
it's not,
it's not like Hicks.

1067
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:34,020
I feel like it has a little bit of
flavor of the Pacific northwest of

1068
00:44:34,021 --> 00:44:36,800
Seattle and Portland,
but then then a,

1069
00:44:36,801 --> 00:44:39,110
a big dose,
a weird to a lot of weird,

1070
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,470
a lot of extreme.

1071
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:42,990
I mean these are,
these are people that are there.

1072
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:44,460
That's,
this is where they're going to live and

1073
00:44:44,461 --> 00:44:45,330
die.
Yeah.

1074
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:46,531
And,
you know,

1075
00:44:46,531 --> 00:44:49,380
it was a grizzly bears everywhere.
A lot of Minnesotans and folks from

1076
00:44:49,381 --> 00:44:51,000
where I grew up there,
there's a big connection.

1077
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:53,760
A lot of people move up to have moved up
to Alaska.

1078
00:44:53,761 --> 00:44:54,870
So I,
like I said,

1079
00:44:54,871 --> 00:44:57,960
I grew up going up there fairly
regularly in the summer.

1080
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:01,020
So who did you say lives that you know,
that lives on Kodiak Island?

1081
00:45:01,021 --> 00:45:04,530
My Dad's sister family.
That's a scary place.

1082
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:07,870
Those bears are fuck and John.
Yeah.

1083
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,810
Yeah.
They onto the biggest brown bears in the

1084
00:45:09,811 --> 00:45:11,410
world.
Uh,

1085
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:15,000
they might be,
I think I've heard that the Kamchatka

1086
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,480
Brown bears in Siberia,
in,

1087
00:45:16,530 --> 00:45:18,750
in Russia across,
I don't know if that is Siberia,

1088
00:45:18,751 --> 00:45:20,920
but up across the,
the water there,

1089
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:22,980
um,
they might be bigger.

1090
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:28,010
I could be totally wrong,
but I saw this video of this guy.

1091
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:31,540
Do you remember that show?
That was on a,

1092
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:33,510
it was called the hunt.
It was,

1093
00:45:33,511 --> 00:45:34,860
um,
a show that,

1094
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:36,650
it was interesting because,
um,

1095
00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:40,200
James Hetfield of Metallica was the
narrator of it.

1096
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:44,220
And people were so angry at him for
narrating this thing that they were,

1097
00:45:44,221 --> 00:45:46,500
uh,
talking about boycotting metallica when

1098
00:45:46,501 --> 00:45:49,500
they played some music festival.
I never watched.

1099
00:45:49,501 --> 00:45:51,450
I remember you talking about it and
then,

1100
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:52,530
yeah,
I know what you're talking about.

1101
00:45:52,531 --> 00:45:54,780
And it was about a bear hunting,
right?

1102
00:45:54,781 --> 00:45:57,000
Yeah.
It was about brown bear hunting,

1103
00:45:57,001 --> 00:46:00,510
which is a really controversial form of
hunting because you don't really eat

1104
00:46:00,511 --> 00:46:01,440
those things.
I mean,

1105
00:46:01,441 --> 00:46:03,840
you kind of can,
but they taste like shit.

1106
00:46:04,330 --> 00:46:06,130
Well,
the coastal ones special,

1107
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,890
they're just eating rotten fish all the
time.

1108
00:46:08,030 --> 00:46:10,560
Yeah,
well like animals tastes like what

1109
00:46:10,561 --> 00:46:11,580
their,
what they eat,

1110
00:46:11,581 --> 00:46:12,700
which is really,
yeah,

1111
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:15,750
I mean it makes sense,
but it seems pretty counterintuitive.

1112
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:20,780
I dare trump to try to take away some of
those Alaskan wilderness areas and they,

1113
00:46:20,850 --> 00:46:23,610
I mean,
the way the real worry is that he's

1114
00:46:23,611 --> 00:46:26,370
going to let people drill in them and
they're going to destroy something.

1115
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,550
That's the real worry.
The real worry is the reason why he's

1116
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:34,320
releasing or relaxing some of these
regulations is that he wants to let

1117
00:46:34,321 --> 00:46:39,300
industry get in there and as soon as
they start fracking and polluting wells

1118
00:46:39,301 --> 00:46:43,410
and rivers and it's just,
it's fucking dangerous man.

1119
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,960
It's just not,
it's something that if they do fuck it

1120
00:46:45,961 --> 00:46:48,660
up,
it could be fucked up for a hundred

1121
00:46:48,661 --> 00:46:49,700
generations.
Yeah.

1122
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:52,260
Did you ever live in New York City?
Not In the city.

1123
00:46:52,261 --> 00:46:55,170
I used to live in new Rochelle,
which is right outside of the Bronx.

1124
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,850
I lived there for seven years or so.
And uh,

1125
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:01,140
if there,
if there wasn't the existence of central

1126
00:47:01,141 --> 00:47:03,390
park and I lived in Brooklyn,
so prospect park,

1127
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:07,980
if those two green places didn't exist
while I lived there,

1128
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:11,220
I would have probably lost my mind or
just moved.

1129
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:14,160
Right.
I feel like these big areas of

1130
00:47:14,161 --> 00:47:16,330
wilderness we have,
you know,

1131
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:21,470
as we will not be okay as,
as humans.

1132
00:47:21,990 --> 00:47:23,740
I mean like individually.
Sure.

1133
00:47:23,810 --> 00:47:25,530
It is it going to,
here's my worry.

1134
00:47:25,531 --> 00:47:27,770
My worry is that,
um,

1135
00:47:28,290 --> 00:47:30,670
you know,
the general American public or the

1136
00:47:30,671 --> 00:47:35,671
general public doesn't have enough
connection or real life experience to

1137
00:47:35,861 --> 00:47:40,861
know why to care so much and you know,
that's a big deal and it's,

1138
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:43,090
um,
I don't know,

1139
00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:45,070
there's a lot of different angles you
can take on that.

1140
00:47:45,071 --> 00:47:46,660
There's the,
there's so much,

1141
00:47:46,661 --> 00:47:48,200
but there's just something that,
uh,

1142
00:47:49,090 --> 00:47:50,320
I wouldn't,
I wouldn't,

1143
00:47:50,321 --> 00:47:52,960
uh,
I mean if it really gets intense,

1144
00:47:52,961 --> 00:47:55,870
I'm going to have to basically drop what
I'm doing and do everything I can to,

1145
00:47:56,530 --> 00:48:01,530
to stop them from,
from harming these places could be done.

1146
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:03,550
My,
my real concern is not just this,

1147
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:07,120
what's going on now,
but the future and then also when you

1148
00:48:07,121 --> 00:48:11,650
really consider it overpopulation,
I mean there's seven and a half billion

1149
00:48:11,651 --> 00:48:13,900
people on the planet now and the most
recent census,

1150
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:15,040
yeah,
this is a,

1151
00:48:15,041 --> 00:48:17,650
that's a half a billion increase over
the last,

1152
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:19,690
I don't know how many years,
but it hasn't been that many.

1153
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:24,010
It was 6 billion just a few years ago.
I remembered that was a number that they

1154
00:48:24,011 --> 00:48:27,850
bandied about like a decade or two ago.
Now it's seven and a half.

1155
00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:31,900
Like what happens when it gets to be 30
like where are we going to put these

1156
00:48:31,901 --> 00:48:33,910
motherfuckers?
What is the carrying capacity?

1157
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:34,980
Then it must apply,
amber.

1158
00:48:34,990 --> 00:48:36,040
Yeah,
it's weird.

1159
00:48:36,041 --> 00:48:38,180
We're like rats on a sinking ship.
Yeah.

1160
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:41,020
We're just scrambling everywhere.
We're everywhere.

1161
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,700
We're like,
it's going to have not another animal

1162
00:48:42,701 --> 00:48:46,000
like us when we're on every fucking
patch of land.

1163
00:48:46,001 --> 00:48:47,320
You can find.
Yeah,

1164
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:50,500
it's weird,
but we're awesome.

1165
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,630
Except these wilderness spots,
right?

1166
00:48:52,631 --> 00:48:56,710
Look at this current world population.
Is that real?

1167
00:48:57,190 --> 00:48:59,620
How do they know that?
Births today?

1168
00:48:59,650 --> 00:49:02,020
It's based off averages.
Look at the burst today.

1169
00:49:02,050 --> 00:49:04,810
You could watch the,
the numbers just roll in.

1170
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:07,450
Oh my God.
The difference between the birth today

1171
00:49:07,451 --> 00:49:09,430
and the death today,
that's incredible.

1172
00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:12,100
That's why it's moving so fast because
we're dying slow as fuck.

1173
00:49:12,370 --> 00:49:14,490
Population growth today.
So the,

1174
00:49:14,491 --> 00:49:19,491
the average 139,000 people today,
44 million this year.

1175
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:24,820
Oh my God.
It's weird,

1176
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,880
but
that's scary.

1177
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:33,630
And what's the u s 400 million?
I think we're 300 plus Mexicans.

1178
00:49:35,470 --> 00:49:38,980
Three 26 it says c but that's,
they're not counting.

1179
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:41,530
They're not counting all the people that
snuck in.

1180
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,590
I just don't think they know.
Like when,

1181
00:49:43,591 --> 00:49:46,300
when they'd say Los Angeles,
let's say Los Angeles,

1182
00:49:46,301 --> 00:49:47,260
20 million.
I'm like,

1183
00:49:47,261 --> 00:49:49,930
okay.
And what about the Mexicans?

1184
00:49:49,970 --> 00:49:50,411
Yeah,
like,

1185
00:49:50,411 --> 00:49:54,130
cause there's a lot,
and I'm not anti Mexican in any way,

1186
00:49:54,131 --> 00:49:55,480
shape or form.
Ladies and gentlemen don't,

1187
00:49:55,510 --> 00:49:57,960
I'm just looking at this pragmatically.
Yeah.

1188
00:49:58,150 --> 00:50:01,180
There's a fucking shit load of illegal
aliens here,

1189
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:05,860
which I support also.
How many people are here that any given

1190
00:50:05,861 --> 00:50:08,980
time that don't live here but are here
on vacation or working here for like a

1191
00:50:08,981 --> 00:50:09,670
week?

1192
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:10,830
That's a good question.
Yeah.

1193
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:13,360
Just added people for hundreds of
thousands,

1194
00:50:13,361 --> 00:50:14,830
I would imagine.
Yeah,

1195
00:50:14,890 --> 00:50:16,420
probably.
Yeah.

1196
00:50:16,450 --> 00:50:20,800
When you get on the four oh five and you
had to San Diego and it takes you six

1197
00:50:20,801 --> 00:50:23,770
hours and you go,
what is this?

1198
00:50:23,771 --> 00:50:27,010
Like what have we done?
This massive humans.

1199
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:28,940
Yeah,
there's so many of us.

1200
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:31,610
But when you get here and you realize,
oh you,

1201
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:34,010
you guys don't have any weather,
that's what it is.

1202
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:35,750
Yeah.
But you could also,

1203
00:50:36,010 --> 00:50:38,120
you know,
go 30 miles outside the city and have

1204
00:50:38,121 --> 00:50:39,110
that same either.
Couldn't ya?

1205
00:50:39,330 --> 00:50:40,163
Yeah,
pretty much.

1206
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:41,660
Yeah.
But you know,

1207
00:50:41,661 --> 00:50:44,420
you don't get the same Taco stands,
right?

1208
00:50:44,690 --> 00:50:45,830
Yeah.
I get it.

1209
00:50:45,831 --> 00:50:46,910
I like,
I love cities,

1210
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:47,660
man.
I miss it.

1211
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:49,520
I miss living in New York City.
I really do to you.

1212
00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:51,590
I wouldn't trade it at this point.
You know,

1213
00:50:51,591 --> 00:50:53,970
I was younger and single in New York,
had a,

1214
00:50:54,030 --> 00:50:59,030
had a fun time and moved to Montana,
have a family now it's kind of perfect

1215
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:00,880
for,
for uh,

1216
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:04,430
where I'm at in my life,
so I don't really need anything else.

1217
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:05,990
Yeah,
that's the balance,

1218
00:51:05,991 --> 00:51:07,820
right?
It's like there is no really perfect

1219
00:51:07,821 --> 00:51:10,520
place.
It's like there's places that are

1220
00:51:10,521 --> 00:51:13,100
perfect for certain things.
Like if you're a comedian,

1221
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:16,370
Los Angeles is the best place to either
Los Angeles or New York.

1222
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:19,910
I prefer Los Angeles.
There's a lot of clubs,

1223
00:51:19,911 --> 00:51:22,790
there's a lot of Comedians,
like most of the best comedians in the

1224
00:51:22,791 --> 00:51:25,550
world live here.
It's a great place for us to network and

1225
00:51:25,551 --> 00:51:27,710
we work together and stuff like that.
And if you,

1226
00:51:28,550 --> 00:51:31,490
if you want to be in that business is
probably the best place in the world to

1227
00:51:31,491 --> 00:51:33,110
do it.
So that's one of the reasons it keeps me

1228
00:51:33,111 --> 00:51:35,750
around here,
plus the podcast and all that jazz.

1229
00:51:35,751 --> 00:51:39,740
But for peace of mind,
it's not the best place.

1230
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:42,260
No.
Does that actually fuck with you?

1231
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:43,153
Yes.
Yeah.

1232
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:46,550
Yeah.
The numbers of humans is just,

1233
00:51:46,610 --> 00:51:48,770
it's untenable.
And you're close to North Korea.

1234
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:50,173
Yeah,
that's right.

1235
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:52,040
That's right.
But if you know what man,

1236
00:51:52,041 --> 00:51:54,320
if they nuke California,
where are you going to go?

1237
00:51:55,010 --> 00:51:56,510
You know?
I mean the whole thing's going to be a

1238
00:51:56,511 --> 00:51:57,344
mess.
Yeah.

1239
00:51:57,740 --> 00:51:59,600
Might as well.
You might be better off if it lands on

1240
00:51:59,601 --> 00:52:00,434
your head.

1241
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:06,680
That's why we say about asteroids,
like you don't want to be that guy in

1242
00:52:06,681 --> 00:52:11,681
the movie that like is like storing food
in his basement and staying up all night

1243
00:52:11,811 --> 00:52:15,710
to shoot vandals and because people are
trying to steal your canned goods.

1244
00:52:15,770 --> 00:52:18,110
That doesn't sound fun.
Not like a healthy life.

1245
00:52:18,390 --> 00:52:19,610
No,
you don't want to live like that.

1246
00:52:19,611 --> 00:52:21,380
And then what happens?
You die of old age.

1247
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:23,420
Die Of old age.
Protecting your canned goods.

1248
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:25,250
Yeah.
In fight or flight your entire life.

1249
00:52:25,251 --> 00:52:27,020
Fuck that.
Fuck that.

1250
00:52:27,021 --> 00:52:29,690
And then just let that rock land right
on your fucking head.

1251
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:34,870
I used to stress out a lot about what
are the perfect place to live was I just

1252
00:52:34,910 --> 00:52:36,440
gave that up.
It doesn't exist.

1253
00:52:36,441 --> 00:52:37,580
Doesn't exist.
There's,

1254
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:41,120
there's places you don't want to be
caught dead like Florida.

1255
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:43,760
I liked Florida.
How dare you.

1256
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:45,730
I like it.
And the part Sarah,

1257
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:48,680
so no,
my wife was raised on Captiva island,

1258
00:52:48,681 --> 00:52:50,420
which is on the east coast.
Okay.

1259
00:52:50,421 --> 00:52:51,980
Like Key West is pretty dope.
Yeah.

1260
00:52:51,981 --> 00:52:52,731
Down there.
It's pretty cool.

1261
00:52:52,731 --> 00:52:54,070
Yeah.
That's a good place.

1262
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:56,960
You just want to drink and take naps or
fish or,

1263
00:52:56,961 --> 00:52:57,794
yeah.
Yeah,

1264
00:52:58,130 --> 00:52:59,240
yeah.
There's some cool stuff down there,

1265
00:52:59,270 --> 00:53:01,910
but it's just,
Florida's just so fucked up.

1266
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:03,020
It's,
they've,

1267
00:53:03,050 --> 00:53:07,760
they've done such damage to Florida.
Would their oxycontin regulations know

1268
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:12,590
one time there were more oxycontin
prescriptions in Florida than they were

1269
00:53:12,591 --> 00:53:15,380
the entire country combined?
Seriously?

1270
00:53:15,381 --> 00:53:17,540
Yes.
I didn't know that was insane.

1271
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:18,980
How is this recent?

1272
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:20,330
As,
as like recent in these,

1273
00:53:20,331 --> 00:53:23,240
in these late struggles?
Yeah,

1274
00:53:23,241 --> 00:53:26,700
there was a documentary that I called
the Oxycontin express that was on

1275
00:53:26,750 --> 00:53:27,830
vanguard.
Wow.

1276
00:53:27,930 --> 00:53:28,710
And,
um,

1277
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:30,800
these people that,
um,

1278
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:34,770
went down there,
they went undercover and uh,

1279
00:53:34,830 --> 00:53:38,310
saw how easy it is to buy opiates down
there.

1280
00:53:38,410 --> 00:53:40,290
They would,
they have these one stop shops,

1281
00:53:40,291 --> 00:53:43,410
they have these pain management centers.
We'd go in and he'd say,

1282
00:53:43,411 --> 00:53:45,010
Hey doc,
my back is killing me.

1283
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:46,500
Doc said,
you need pills.

1284
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:48,630
Go right next door.
So he'd write your prescription,

1285
00:53:48,631 --> 00:53:50,850
you go right next door,
you get the pills and then boom,

1286
00:53:50,851 --> 00:53:53,460
you're off to the races.
And they didn't have a database,

1287
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:56,570
which meant that you could go to Dr
Jamie and say,

1288
00:53:56,850 --> 00:53:58,020
Jamie,
my back's killing me.

1289
00:53:58,021 --> 00:54:01,440
Dr Jamie gives you a prescription.
You buy some opium pills or whatever the

1290
00:54:01,441 --> 00:54:04,050
fuck they are.
And then you come to me and he'd go,

1291
00:54:04,051 --> 00:54:05,610
Doctor Joe,
my back is killing me.

1292
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:06,301
I'm like,
Oh,

1293
00:54:06,301 --> 00:54:09,750
you see where this just being sourced
there and then so sold elsewhere or did

1294
00:54:09,751 --> 00:54:14,751
we purposely made the regulations lax
there so they can make more money.

1295
00:54:15,031 --> 00:54:18,960
So people were buying them and then
bringing them and selling them and

1296
00:54:18,961 --> 00:54:21,330
Kentucky and up to Ohio,
the,

1297
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:23,580
that's why they call it the Oxycontin
Express,

1298
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:27,360
the highway that led from Florida to the
rest of the country.

1299
00:54:27,390 --> 00:54:28,470
It sounds evil.
Yeah.

1300
00:54:28,471 --> 00:54:31,800
It was sick and you know,
a lot of people lost their lives and a

1301
00:54:31,801 --> 00:54:34,860
lot of people lost like who they were
because of the addiction.

1302
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:35,940
Wow.
Yeah.

1303
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,240
The numbers were insane.
Like Google the numbers.

1304
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:41,940
Like what,
what were the numbers of oxy cottons or

1305
00:54:41,941 --> 00:54:44,190
oxycodone?
I still don't know what the differences,

1306
00:54:44,870 --> 00:54:48,160
and you've seen the reports lately
showing that the uh,

1307
00:54:48,210 --> 00:54:53,130
the life expectancy or the early death
rate of middle age white men

1308
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:56,160
specifically lately,
it has dropped for the first time in,

1309
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,650
I dunno,
dozens or cause of pain pills.

1310
00:54:58,650 --> 00:54:59,161
Yeah.
Well,

1311
00:54:59,161 --> 00:55:02,340
part of it and calling them deaths of
despair.

1312
00:55:02,610 --> 00:55:05,460
Woo.
How they're being Jesus written about is

1313
00:55:05,461 --> 00:55:07,170
literally deaths of despair.
It's,

1314
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:08,100
it's,
yeah.

1315
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:09,660
Jesus.
Oh,

1316
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:11,070
it's heavy.
It's real heavy.

1317
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:13,680
That's a heavy,
he's been a spate of articles over the

1318
00:55:13,681 --> 00:55:17,740
last three or four months.
Just that's really diving into it.

1319
00:55:17,741 --> 00:55:18,960
And it's guys,
it's men.

1320
00:55:19,230 --> 00:55:22,050
Here it is.
Doctors in Florida prescribed 10 times

1321
00:55:22,051 --> 00:55:26,280
more oxycodone pills then every other
state in the country combined.

1322
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:30,240
Wow.
And this is now,

1323
00:55:30,241 --> 00:55:31,800
right?
What ends this article from,

1324
00:55:32,550 --> 00:55:34,740
this was actually from 2011 on NPR when
the,

1325
00:55:34,770 --> 00:55:36,150
probably when it came out.
Ah,

1326
00:55:36,151 --> 00:55:39,300
there we go.
I can get the updated one.

1327
00:55:39,410 --> 00:55:40,530
Yeah,
it doesn't matter.

1328
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:42,210
It's just,
it's a crazy place.

1329
00:55:42,550 --> 00:55:46,230
Let's just put it that way.
Despairs one of the scariest words,

1330
00:55:46,590 --> 00:55:50,160
despair.
When you hear about someone like despair

1331
00:55:50,161 --> 00:55:52,320
and lonely,
those are two like really?

1332
00:55:52,830 --> 00:55:54,610
So that's the other word that they're
using is,

1333
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:59,530
is his loneliness has been there.
Now measuring it and loneliness is,

1334
00:55:59,910 --> 00:56:04,910
is as or worse of a health issue in our
country than smoking heavily smoking

1335
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:07,140
there.
There's all this,

1336
00:56:07,141 --> 00:56:11,370
there's this new only misses.
Loneliness isn't overpopulation

1337
00:56:11,371 --> 00:56:16,170
coincided with lowliness the same time
we're thrust further and further closer

1338
00:56:16,171 --> 00:56:21,171
together and we don't know each other
and we're more and more disconnected and

1339
00:56:21,401 --> 00:56:22,770
lonely.
And it's literally,

1340
00:56:22,771 --> 00:56:24,090
so there's a whole new,
um,

1341
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:26,110
I dunno how new,
but it's called interpersonal

1342
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:29,590
neurobiology,
which is the science of our brain

1343
00:56:29,591 --> 00:56:33,370
wiring.
And physiological wiring on how we're,

1344
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:34,120
uh,
yeah,

1345
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:37,440
this is one of the articles.
Loneliness might be a bigger health risk

1346
00:56:37,450 --> 00:56:40,510
than smoking or obesity.
Whoa,

1347
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:42,700
that's dark dude.
It's dark.

1348
00:56:42,701 --> 00:56:43,930
But you know,
with the,

1349
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:47,290
in my life,
the experience I've had in my life,

1350
00:56:47,291 --> 00:56:49,490
I'm,
when I read that I'm like of course Duh,

1351
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:51,070
Duh.
It makes sense.

1352
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:53,410
Yeah.
We are a disconnected people.

1353
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:58,000
We are electronically,
digitally connected in a crazy way but

1354
00:56:58,001 --> 00:57:02,410
in a human way and it's killing.
It literally is harming.

1355
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:05,860
Awesome.
People are dying and it's crazy.

1356
00:57:06,070 --> 00:57:10,360
It's crazy stuff.
Fascinating that like feelings have an

1357
00:57:10,361 --> 00:57:13,040
effect on your health.
Like the feeling of loneliness to

1358
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:15,100
feeling of despair.
It's not like you could eat your

1359
00:57:15,101 --> 00:57:17,230
vegetables,
you can get your exercise in and you,

1360
00:57:17,231 --> 00:57:19,450
if you feel despair and you feel
loneliness,

1361
00:57:19,690 --> 00:57:22,660
your body is actually like being harmed
by that.

1362
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:26,530
But there's a real like practical reason
for that and that's because we are,

1363
00:57:26,531 --> 00:57:31,150
when we come out as babies,
we are the most dependent individuals.

1364
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:32,890
So like are,
you know what I mean?

1365
00:57:32,891 --> 00:57:34,190
Like on your parents,
on your mother.

1366
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:38,050
We are completely socially dependent
when we're born completely.

1367
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:39,460
And so,
you know,

1368
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:42,160
April Maslov's hierarchy of needs.
You ever heard of that?

1369
00:57:42,161 --> 00:57:43,780
So it's like,
you know,

1370
00:57:43,781 --> 00:57:45,910
to be okay,
you have to take care of breathing and

1371
00:57:45,911 --> 00:57:48,310
water and your basic functions.
But there's,

1372
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:52,750
there's been studies recently by these
neurobiologists that are showing that

1373
00:57:52,751 --> 00:57:57,751
these social needs are just as,
or even like come before some of these

1374
00:57:58,511 --> 00:57:59,301
physical needs.
There's,

1375
00:57:59,301 --> 00:58:00,134
there's,
it's,

1376
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:02,410
it's crazy man.
And there's literally,

1377
00:58:03,490 --> 00:58:06,500
there's a book called social by a guy
named Matthew Lieberman.

1378
00:58:06,550 --> 00:58:10,060
Like you gotta check it out.
And so what they are finding is that

1379
00:58:10,061 --> 00:58:11,700
there's like two,
uh,

1380
00:58:11,770 --> 00:58:14,500
parts of our operating brain,
and this is,

1381
00:58:14,810 --> 00:58:17,290
you know,
going to be me paring it down,

1382
00:58:17,291 --> 00:58:20,890
but one is the analytical thinking,
deciding thing.

1383
00:58:20,890 --> 00:58:23,410
And the other is this social awareness
sprain,

1384
00:58:23,411 --> 00:58:28,411
which is always like always checking in
on how am I in relation to others.

1385
00:58:28,811 --> 00:58:31,060
And it's also the part of their brain
that actually we can,

1386
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:33,340
you know,
like the metacognitive part and the part

1387
00:58:33,341 --> 00:58:35,350
that I can,
they call it mind reading,

1388
00:58:35,351 --> 00:58:37,840
but really it's just,
it's just by US sitting here,

1389
00:58:37,841 --> 00:58:41,020
I can kind of get a sense of how you
feel and what you're thinking right.

1390
00:58:41,021 --> 00:58:44,110
Just by the,
the connection that we have and just,

1391
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:47,920
it's part of who we are.
So when our analytical brain is offline,

1392
00:58:47,921 --> 00:58:50,590
this other one,
the social one pops on immediately.

1393
00:58:50,650 --> 00:58:54,400
So,
so what they're theorizing is that that

1394
00:58:54,401 --> 00:58:59,401
is like the fundamental need for humans
in safety and survival is how are we

1395
00:59:01,390 --> 00:59:03,370
relating to each other as a,
as a group.

1396
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:06,820
But it makes sense if you look,
I mean to me it makes sense in,

1397
00:59:06,850 --> 00:59:08,170
um,
you know,

1398
00:59:08,171 --> 00:59:09,310
we are social animals.

1399
00:59:09,310 --> 00:59:13,000
We forget that I think,
but you look at other species of monkeys

1400
00:59:13,001 --> 00:59:15,820
or wolves or whatever.
I mean,

1401
00:59:16,090 --> 00:59:19,090
you know,
there might be a period of time where

1402
00:59:19,210 --> 00:59:19,721
say,
Oh,

1403
00:59:19,721 --> 00:59:22,010
a wolf will,
we'll get kicked of a pack for a while

1404
00:59:22,011 --> 00:59:24,530
and he'll go do his thing,
but eventually come back to a pack.

1405
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:28,640
It's not safe for us as humans and
animals,

1406
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:31,190
social animals like these to be
isolated.

1407
00:59:31,250 --> 00:59:32,360
It's not.
And,

1408
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:34,720
and so there's all these parts of us
that just,

1409
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:37,790
if we're not connected to other people
in a,

1410
00:59:37,791 --> 00:59:42,500
in a very direct and true way,
there's these sort of a deep down

1411
00:59:42,590 --> 00:59:45,590
emotional and physiological,
uh,

1412
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:47,450
fears that come up.
Right?

1413
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:49,130
And they,
and they're the real,

1414
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:50,900
and that's what the neurobiology is
showing,

1415
00:59:50,901 --> 00:59:53,480
which is really interesting.
And when we can just think about that,

1416
00:59:53,481 --> 00:59:57,080
but they're actually showing it now that
if we're not really connected to each

1417
00:59:57,081 --> 00:59:58,820
other,
we're going to be freaked out.

1418
00:59:59,030 --> 01:00:00,470
We're not going to be okay.
And,

1419
01:00:00,890 --> 01:00:02,210
um,
you know,

1420
01:00:02,211 --> 01:00:06,710
I really believe that this really drives
a lot of the internal struggle we have.

1421
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:08,680
And we're really,
and this is part of,

1422
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:09,540
you know,
getting into it,

1423
01:00:09,541 --> 01:00:12,200
but that's part of my,
what I'm trying to bring into the world

1424
01:00:12,201 --> 01:00:14,300
and my platform now is,
is just to,

1425
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:16,730
you know,
stand up and say,

1426
01:00:16,731 --> 01:00:19,100
hey,
we need each other and we can do it.

1427
01:00:19,101 --> 01:00:21,830
It's not,
and for guys pitch specifically,

1428
01:00:21,831 --> 01:00:24,860
right,
it's such a social stigma of ours to not

1429
01:00:24,861 --> 01:00:28,310
be real or open or connected or
vulnerable with guys.

1430
01:00:28,490 --> 01:00:31,040
And uh,
and it's,

1431
01:00:31,041 --> 01:00:33,060
uh,
it's cool to see the science coming out

1432
01:00:33,061 --> 01:00:35,630
because it's,
I have all this anecdotal evidence of

1433
01:00:35,631 --> 01:00:38,600
being out the woods in the woods with
kids or being in a,

1434
01:00:38,601 --> 01:00:41,750
in a management with guys are running a
retreat or whatever this is of how

1435
01:00:41,751 --> 01:00:46,751
powerful it is to like set down all of
our differences and just be there with

1436
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:48,110
them.

1437
01:00:48,110 --> 01:00:51,170
But now the science is really lighten it
up and yeah,

1438
01:00:51,171 --> 01:00:51,950
man,
loneliest.

1439
01:00:51,950 --> 01:00:54,140
I mean we can all think about a
loneliness isn't fun.

1440
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:56,300
It's not a,
it doesn't feel good.

1441
01:00:56,630 --> 01:00:59,690
But the other,
this is crazy too that they're showing

1442
01:00:59,691 --> 01:01:03,860
that emotional pain,
the lights up the same centers of our

1443
01:01:03,861 --> 01:01:05,630
brain.
It's physical pain.

1444
01:01:06,170 --> 01:01:08,800
And that the one study showed that,
um,

1445
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:14,260
an insult to someone had much more
painful and long term effects than

1446
01:01:14,841 --> 01:01:17,480
slamming somebody with a hammer hitting
their hand with a hammer.

1447
01:01:17,810 --> 01:01:22,810
So like our emotional pain literally
actually exists in the body.

1448
01:01:23,270 --> 01:01:27,650
Like it is actual pain.
And the reason that it's so

1449
01:01:27,651 --> 01:01:30,440
uncomfortable to feel our emotions,
which it is,

1450
01:01:30,441 --> 01:01:33,170
you know,
I mean I'll just say it is,

1451
01:01:33,530 --> 01:01:35,690
is that it actually hurts like actually
hurts.

1452
01:01:35,691 --> 01:01:38,120
I mean,
and there's like people say things like,

1453
01:01:38,121 --> 01:01:40,730
you broke my heart or I'm dying of heart
ache or whatever,

1454
01:01:40,731 --> 01:01:44,810
but the science is catching up and
showing us that this pain is actual,

1455
01:01:45,020 --> 01:01:48,170
it's real and we're not addressing it.
We're not even aware of it.

1456
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:50,510
That's really interesting.
That's deep.

1457
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:53,550
You know,
it's interesting too because what you're

1458
01:01:53,551 --> 01:01:57,520
saying about us being disconnected and
how unhealthy it is now on unhealthy

1459
01:01:57,540 --> 01:02:01,320
loneliness is it sort of confirms these
ideas that I've always had,

1460
01:02:01,321 --> 01:02:06,321
that the human race itself is not like a
group of individuals but a super

1461
01:02:06,541 --> 01:02:09,660
organism.
Much like the human body is like the

1462
01:02:09,661 --> 01:02:12,810
human body like requires all the
bacteria in your gut,

1463
01:02:13,050 --> 01:02:16,470
all the skin flora,
all the different things that compose

1464
01:02:16,471 --> 01:02:18,840
the actual physical structure of the
human body.

1465
01:02:18,870 --> 01:02:23,280
Whereas we think of it,
I think there's some nutty number of how

1466
01:02:23,281 --> 01:02:26,910
much bacteria,
how many bacteria cells are in your body

1467
01:02:26,911 --> 01:02:30,450
versus how many human cells and is he
far out numbers,

1468
01:02:30,451 --> 01:02:34,920
the human cells.
And it's just that we think of ourselves

1469
01:02:34,921 --> 01:02:39,120
as I'm mike and I put my shoes on and I
go to work cause I am Mike and,

1470
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:40,740
but Mike,
you're a system,

1471
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:45,930
you're a system of individual organisms
that are collectively keeping this whole

1472
01:02:45,931 --> 01:02:48,420
thing alive.
And when the imbalances off,

1473
01:02:48,421 --> 01:02:52,590
like when someone takes an antibiotic
and it fucks up their gut flora,

1474
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:57,800
like literally you've like nuked a part
of your civilization and you know to try

1475
01:02:57,841 --> 01:03:01,290
to save something.
Like if you had some sort of a surgery

1476
01:03:01,291 --> 01:03:04,470
and you're worried about an infection,
which is kind of like an invading army

1477
01:03:04,471 --> 01:03:08,040
coming in and taking over part of your
leg that you have it operated on.

1478
01:03:08,140 --> 01:03:09,850
Yeah.
Or It'd be like slashing the tires of

1479
01:03:09,851 --> 01:03:11,710
all of our transport system in the
country.

1480
01:03:11,711 --> 01:03:14,170
Like that's how it got.
That's like the first things in an in

1481
01:03:14,171 --> 01:03:14,700
and out.
Yeah.

1482
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:16,920
Yeah.
And even has an impact on your,

1483
01:03:16,921 --> 01:03:18,690
your health mentally.
Oh,

1484
01:03:18,691 --> 01:03:22,590
in terms of like how you feel and your
depression.

1485
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:24,780
A lot of that has connected,
led,

1486
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:29,840
legitimately connected to your diet and
how that affects your gut flora and it

1487
01:03:30,121 --> 01:03:34,950
affects the way your body produces
serotonin and dopamine and it's bananas,

1488
01:03:34,951 --> 01:03:35,730
man.
Oh yeah.

1489
01:03:35,730 --> 01:03:36,331
No,
I get it.

1490
01:03:36,331 --> 01:03:40,410
Is Scientists Bust the myth that our
bodies have more bacteria than human

1491
01:03:40,411 --> 01:03:44,100
cells.
Decades old assumption about Microbiota

1492
01:03:44,101 --> 01:03:45,120
revisited.
Okay.

1493
01:03:45,121 --> 01:03:48,070
What's the new new data one instead of,
oh,

1494
01:03:48,130 --> 01:03:51,450
so it's why you are as much.
Okay,

1495
01:03:51,451 --> 01:03:55,260
so they used to say it was 10 to one but
now it's one to one.

1496
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:56,730
Okay.
Wow.

1497
01:03:56,731 --> 01:03:57,960
That's still crazy,
man.

1498
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:00,040
It's still like you're half bacteria.
Yeah.

1499
01:04:00,380 --> 01:04:04,360
I like that analogy though of the body
is like a civilization or what it means

1500
01:04:04,370 --> 01:04:08,090
to think about if you're one of your,
I dunno,

1501
01:04:08,150 --> 01:04:12,020
one important neuron,
one cell neural cell or something

1502
01:04:12,021 --> 01:04:14,750
decided just to go rogue and not be in
connection with the rest of you.

1503
01:04:14,810 --> 01:04:15,860
Right.
I mean,

1504
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:18,020
I don't,
that wouldn't work so well.

1505
01:04:18,021 --> 01:04:18,621
Right?
I don't know.

1506
01:04:18,621 --> 01:04:20,900
I don't know what happened.
Your body would probably get rid of it

1507
01:04:20,901 --> 01:04:25,901
and get it out of there or I don't know,
maybe so I'm just really reaching here,

1508
01:04:26,511 --> 01:04:29,240
but it's some sort of rogue cell at that
point.

1509
01:04:29,241 --> 01:04:31,090
Right.
Like cancerous cell or something and it

1510
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:34,130
would probably be attacked.
So yeah,

1511
01:04:34,131 --> 01:04:37,010
if I think that if you'd take that
analogy,

1512
01:04:37,011 --> 01:04:39,620
you know,
our civilization here is we're hurting,

1513
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:42,140
really hurting because we're,
we're really not,

1514
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:44,960
you know,
we are working together obviously in

1515
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:46,940
practical ways.
A lot of times,

1516
01:04:46,941 --> 01:04:48,770
you know,
work in commerce and you know,

1517
01:04:48,771 --> 01:04:52,310
the world is functioning.
But I think on a like a health and

1518
01:04:52,311 --> 01:04:53,780
fulfillment level,
we're,

1519
01:04:53,781 --> 01:04:56,050
we're missing something pretty deeply.
Yeah.

1520
01:04:56,090 --> 01:04:57,560
Well also like

1521
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:02,050
let's talk about people that are
disconnected from actual humans but

1522
01:05:02,051 --> 01:05:04,250
connect them the cyber way.
Yeah.

1523
01:05:04,420 --> 01:05:08,230
Like how many people are like really
lonely in terms of like physical touch

1524
01:05:08,231 --> 01:05:11,680
and communication with friends and,
but they sit in front of their computer

1525
01:05:11,681 --> 01:05:13,810
all day and they interact with people
online,

1526
01:05:14,020 --> 01:05:17,380
which shows you like some of the most
unhealthy communities you'll ever

1527
01:05:17,381 --> 01:05:22,381
encounter are like online message boards
and forums where people are just the

1528
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:26,560
anonymous and interacting with people
without what we were talking about

1529
01:05:26,561 --> 01:05:28,270
earlier.
Like one of the reasons why I like to do

1530
01:05:28,271 --> 01:05:32,230
podcasts with a person in the room.
I've only done one podcast ever through

1531
01:05:32,231 --> 01:05:33,500
skype.
Um,

1532
01:05:33,550 --> 01:05:37,530
and that was with John Anthony West
cause he was living in New York and he's

1533
01:05:37,531 --> 01:05:40,540
just this really important egyptologist
and I really wanted to talk to him as

1534
01:05:40,541 --> 01:05:42,370
the only way I could get them to do it
was to do it through skype.

1535
01:05:42,371 --> 01:05:45,010
So I did one,
I prefer to sit there with people

1536
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:47,350
because I want to look at them.
I want to feel their energy.

1537
01:05:47,351 --> 01:05:49,480
I want to,
I feel like you and I doing this

1538
01:05:49,481 --> 01:05:51,640
conversation,
you get to understand each other.

1539
01:05:51,730 --> 01:05:52,331
Totally.
No,

1540
01:05:52,331 --> 01:05:52,991
I get it.
And I,

1541
01:05:52,991 --> 01:05:55,150
and I think I can hear it in your
podcast too.

1542
01:05:55,151 --> 01:05:56,230
And I think that,
uh,

1543
01:05:57,220 --> 01:05:58,120
you know,
and again,

1544
01:05:58,180 --> 01:06:00,190
I'm not going to keep hitting the
biology part,

1545
01:06:00,191 --> 01:06:01,840
but there's,
to me,

1546
01:06:02,110 --> 01:06:06,670
I think that it means,
I can sense that there's something else

1547
01:06:06,671 --> 01:06:08,050
in me is getting,
is triggered,

1548
01:06:08,051 --> 01:06:09,760
right?
If we were just talking on the phone,

1549
01:06:10,090 --> 01:06:13,480
there is something,
and it's might be this other part of

1550
01:06:13,481 --> 01:06:14,980
your brain,
but it's lit up right now.

1551
01:06:14,981 --> 01:06:15,910
Right.
Because I can,

1552
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:18,340
I can spatially,
you know,

1553
01:06:18,370 --> 01:06:20,110
so you can feel where you are.
We can,

1554
01:06:20,111 --> 01:06:23,640
we can have social content,
all that,

1555
01:06:23,830 --> 01:06:24,760
all of that.
Yeah.

1556
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,530
And it's,
it's set sense of connection.

1557
01:06:26,531 --> 01:06:27,930
It's that real.
Um,

1558
01:06:29,150 --> 01:06:30,340
I think,
and I think that is,

1559
01:06:30,370 --> 01:06:32,350
you know,
really apparent in your podcast is that

1560
01:06:32,470 --> 01:06:33,550
you,
yeah,

1561
01:06:33,551 --> 01:06:36,580
you sit here and you really connect to
somebody and just run with it.

1562
01:06:36,580 --> 01:06:39,160
And I think that's a,
it's a big,

1563
01:06:39,430 --> 01:06:40,930
it's a big thing,
man.

1564
01:06:40,931 --> 01:06:41,471
I mean,
I mean,

1565
01:06:41,471 --> 01:06:44,140
I think of like,
um,

1566
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:49,600
so part of what I do is I help
proliferate this idea of men's groups

1567
01:06:49,601 --> 01:06:53,560
across the country where guys get
together for exactly what we're talking

1568
01:06:53,561 --> 01:06:54,460
about.
It's just like,

1569
01:06:54,790 --> 01:06:55,391
you know,
the,

1570
01:06:55,391 --> 01:06:57,580
the intent of them is to,
um,

1571
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:01,810
get together to challenge and support
each other's growth or personal growth,

1572
01:07:01,811 --> 01:07:04,750
you know,
and it's just a simple sort of protocol

1573
01:07:04,751 --> 01:07:06,970
and a simple sort of,
um,

1574
01:07:07,220 --> 01:07:08,980
uh,
design or are sort of,

1575
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:13,810
there's a structure to it.
But the whole point is it's remedial in

1576
01:07:13,811 --> 01:07:14,740
a sense.
It's that,

1577
01:07:15,580 --> 01:07:16,780
you know,
our culture in general,

1578
01:07:16,781 --> 01:07:18,520
but guys,
especially in our culture,

1579
01:07:18,521 --> 01:07:23,521
don't have this,
this on fettered place to really show up

1580
01:07:26,081 --> 01:07:29,020
and actually connect with each other.
And it's a scary thing.

1581
01:07:29,021 --> 01:07:29,411
I mean,
it's,

1582
01:07:29,411 --> 01:07:30,490
uh,
it's,

1583
01:07:30,491 --> 01:07:31,300
it's,
um,

1584
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:33,610
you know,
it's until now and still now,

1585
01:07:33,611 --> 01:07:37,810
but hopefully not too long.
I really like that stigma of not being

1586
01:07:37,811 --> 01:07:39,660
connected is,
um,

1587
01:07:39,940 --> 01:07:40,920
it's a big deal.
And,

1588
01:07:40,921 --> 01:07:44,500
and I think that back to the cyber thing
that you're saying like we can,

1589
01:07:45,130 --> 01:07:47,620
we can get that hit of Serotonin by
getting a,

1590
01:07:47,621 --> 01:07:49,330
like on facebook or instagram or
whatever.

1591
01:07:49,331 --> 01:07:51,520
We can get that.
But that pain,

1592
01:07:51,580 --> 01:07:54,130
I mean,
I don't even want to make a comparison

1593
01:07:54,370 --> 01:07:57,610
toward actually sitting,
sitting down with somebody and actually

1594
01:07:58,210 --> 01:08:01,720
feeling and,
and experiencing them.

1595
01:08:01,780 --> 01:08:02,830
Yeah.
It's,

1596
01:08:02,831 --> 01:08:04,660
you can't make a comparison.
No,

1597
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:07,060
it's not okay to me.
I don't,

1598
01:08:07,061 --> 01:08:08,770
yeah,
it's just something different.

1599
01:08:09,010 --> 01:08:13,060
I'm in a tricky position because I rely
on social media to let people know that

1600
01:08:13,061 --> 01:08:15,050
I have a podcast coming out,
you know,

1601
01:08:15,051 --> 01:08:16,490
like right before the podcast I was
like,

1602
01:08:16,491 --> 01:08:18,010
what's your twitter?
So I can tweet it.

1603
01:08:18,350 --> 01:08:22,370
And then I also like to promote comedy
dates and to let people know about cool

1604
01:08:22,371 --> 01:08:25,110
shit that I find,
but the,

1605
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:27,920
the interaction is so,
it's so weird.

1606
01:08:27,950 --> 01:08:30,890
Like especially there's like a bunch of
different kinds of interactions.

1607
01:08:30,891 --> 01:08:35,891
Like instagram is one of the weird ones
because the Qantas people all have

1608
01:08:36,351 --> 01:08:39,170
blocked pages.
It's like they're blocking,

1609
01:08:39,380 --> 01:08:42,710
don't look at me and they just say nasty
shit to people.

1610
01:08:42,711 --> 01:08:44,660
But they have these block pages.
It's like,

1611
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:48,410
but I think that that's,
it's so funny how that seems to be like

1612
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:51,500
it's so common,
but it makes sense.

1613
01:08:51,590 --> 01:08:55,190
It's like they're blocked off and
they're attacking people in Saint Shitty

1614
01:08:55,191 --> 01:08:55,430
things.

1615
01:08:55,430 --> 01:08:56,750
To be blunt,
I'm not even talking about,

1616
01:08:56,751 --> 01:08:58,550
to me,
I'm talking about like when I go to

1617
01:08:58,551 --> 01:09:01,700
someone else's page and I read
[inaudible] things,

1618
01:09:01,850 --> 01:09:04,010
I always go to that I go,
let's see if that guy is blocked.

1619
01:09:04,011 --> 01:09:04,940
Yup.
He's blocked.

1620
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,040
How funny.
Like it's super common.

1621
01:09:07,041 --> 01:09:09,920
It's like this weird thing that people
are doing with each other.

1622
01:09:09,950 --> 01:09:14,540
What's not real interaction and I feel
like the people that are perpetrating it

1623
01:09:14,780 --> 01:09:18,530
are extremely unhealthy,
which is why they're saying such nasty,

1624
01:09:18,531 --> 01:09:21,200
vicious shit in the first place.
It's really,

1625
01:09:21,201 --> 01:09:22,820
really odd.
They're lonely.

1626
01:09:23,210 --> 01:09:23,841
Yeah.
No,

1627
01:09:23,841 --> 01:09:28,841
I mean in some way or disconnected or
disenfranchised or they feel inferior

1628
01:09:30,370 --> 01:09:32,450
and so they lash out.
They want other people to feel the way

1629
01:09:32,451 --> 01:09:33,284
they feel.

1630
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:35,520
And so what I,
what I feel when you say that,

1631
01:09:35,521 --> 01:09:38,560
like one thing that's missing there is
empathy in that,

1632
01:09:38,561 --> 01:09:40,720
in that interact,
whatever that interaction is.

1633
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:44,620
It's this removed story that you're
making up some,

1634
01:09:44,770 --> 01:09:47,350
some like whatever you want the world,
you know,

1635
01:09:47,740 --> 01:09:51,520
projecting your shit out into the world.
You're not actually slowing down enough

1636
01:09:51,521 --> 01:09:52,840
to,
you know,

1637
01:09:52,841 --> 01:09:55,060
you can sit here and give opinions or
whatever all day long.

1638
01:09:55,061 --> 01:09:58,600
But you know the,
but to what you said though,

1639
01:09:58,900 --> 01:10:01,660
it is a weird position,
but I think the way that things are

1640
01:10:01,661 --> 01:10:03,760
going,
so we are using these tools,

1641
01:10:03,820 --> 01:10:06,940
social media to connect us and to get
messages out.

1642
01:10:07,660 --> 01:10:08,800
But you know,
the way that the,

1643
01:10:08,801 --> 01:10:12,580
like the millennial generation is going
is that what they value and what they

1644
01:10:12,581 --> 01:10:14,860
want to spend their money on.
There's meaningful experiences,

1645
01:10:14,861 --> 01:10:16,390
which means,
you know,

1646
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:19,660
generally speaking,
alive in person event.

1647
01:10:19,660 --> 01:10:21,910
And I think there is a wave of things
going back to this.

1648
01:10:21,911 --> 01:10:23,230
So,
you know,

1649
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:26,440
as a tool we need that.
I mean this is amazing.

1650
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:27,760
You know,
this platform,

1651
01:10:27,761 --> 01:10:30,400
this podcast,
you have the touching so many people or

1652
01:10:30,401 --> 01:10:31,540
just twitter,
whatever it is.

1653
01:10:32,710 --> 01:10:36,970
But then it can be used for incredible
good to bring two people together I

1654
01:10:36,971 --> 01:10:37,481
think.
And then,

1655
01:10:37,481 --> 01:10:41,800
and then so what's missing in that?
In that social media interaction.

1656
01:10:41,900 --> 01:10:42,970
Uh,
I don't know.

1657
01:10:42,971 --> 01:10:44,230
Maybe it balances out.
Maybe it doesn't,

1658
01:10:44,231 --> 01:10:46,480
I don't really know.
But a message in a bottle,

1659
01:10:46,630 --> 01:10:48,370
he just got to make sure it's a good
message.

1660
01:10:48,670 --> 01:10:49,570
You know,
you're not going to,

1661
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:52,990
you're not,
you'd have to like be cognizantly aware

1662
01:10:53,020 --> 01:10:57,100
I think of how other people are going to
receive it without actually getting that

1663
01:10:57,310 --> 01:10:59,670
perception back from them.
You know,

1664
01:10:59,671 --> 01:11:01,480
it's,
and that's where it gets real weird and

1665
01:11:01,481 --> 01:11:05,050
you have to like,
I think apply the same principle

1666
01:11:05,140 --> 01:11:07,810
goals that you would in communicating
with other people,

1667
01:11:08,530 --> 01:11:11,280
like without actually communicating
with,

1668
01:11:11,310 --> 01:11:14,030
without seeing them,
without getting the social that look in

1669
01:11:14,030 --> 01:11:14,940
them in the eye and

1670
01:11:15,470 --> 01:11:16,820
where,
where a weird thing,

1671
01:11:16,821 --> 01:11:18,950
man,
this might not make sense,

1672
01:11:18,951 --> 01:11:21,980
but I'm going to bring it back to
connect to the wilderness stuff.

1673
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:25,910
What we're talking about in this sense
of this sort of isolation and loneliness

1674
01:11:25,911 --> 01:11:30,911
that we have and for me in my life where
I learned to connect with others,

1675
01:11:31,730 --> 01:11:34,130
where I really learned to sort of give
it up,

1676
01:11:34,131 --> 01:11:37,040
let go be present with people was in the
wilderness.

1677
01:11:37,041 --> 01:11:40,040
It was,
it was doing that job out in the desert

1678
01:11:40,041 --> 01:11:45,041
with kids out there for eight to 20 days
at a time with these kids were,

1679
01:11:46,310 --> 01:11:50,810
that was my job.
It was my job to simply be with them and

1680
01:11:50,811 --> 01:11:52,260
in a way,
uh,

1681
01:11:52,310 --> 01:11:54,200
to be with them in a way that was,
um,

1682
01:11:55,850 --> 01:11:58,010
you know,
obviously we had a lot of boundaries and

1683
01:11:58,011 --> 01:12:00,050
everything,
but to be really real,

1684
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:03,890
just to be totally real and honest and
straight forward call bullshit when we

1685
01:12:03,891 --> 01:12:06,650
saw bullshit,
be empathetic and it was just like this

1686
01:12:06,651 --> 01:12:09,290
crazy crash course in human connection.

1687
01:12:09,290 --> 01:12:11,870
And I happened to be out in the
wilderness,

1688
01:12:11,871 --> 01:12:15,770
but so what I think this is,
this is,

1689
01:12:16,100 --> 01:12:20,330
it'll tie it together,
but for me I started to feel way,

1690
01:12:20,331 --> 01:12:23,000
way,
way more human being out there in the

1691
01:12:23,001 --> 01:12:24,600
wilderness.
Like just being out there.

1692
01:12:24,601 --> 01:12:27,050
What was quiet being out there where
like,

1693
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:29,270
you know,
if I sat on a rock,

1694
01:12:29,271 --> 01:12:33,710
I was sitting on a rock in the sun was
on me and all of my senses were engaged,

1695
01:12:33,770 --> 01:12:35,480
you know,
very aware of my body.

1696
01:12:35,930 --> 01:12:38,390
We were in these groups where we're
being practicing,

1697
01:12:38,391 --> 01:12:41,750
being very aware of what we felt and
being able to feel and express that.

1698
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:43,540
And it just felt like,
um,

1699
01:12:44,690 --> 01:12:46,340
you know,
since then for me,

1700
01:12:46,341 --> 01:12:48,500
it all comes back to,
to being out in the wilderness.

1701
01:12:48,501 --> 01:12:50,510
But since then,
all the other things I've engaged in

1702
01:12:50,990 --> 01:12:53,120
meditation,
the men's group stuff,

1703
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:56,120
all the other person,
even psychedelics,

1704
01:12:56,121 --> 01:12:56,630
things like that.

1705
01:12:56,630 --> 01:13:00,770
All the things that I've experienced all
for me tie back to that thing and it,

1706
01:13:01,910 --> 01:13:06,910
it comes down to what I feel is like
being totally as much as you can truly

1707
01:13:07,910 --> 01:13:09,050
present.
Yeah.

1708
01:13:09,070 --> 01:13:11,320
Like just,
just here right now.

1709
01:13:11,321 --> 01:13:13,580
Right.
And you can write a twitter message from

1710
01:13:13,581 --> 01:13:15,260
that place of being present.
Right.

1711
01:13:15,261 --> 01:13:16,390
That's fine.
I mean there's,

1712
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:18,710
there's nothing necessarily wrong or bad
about that,

1713
01:13:19,220 --> 01:13:22,070
but um,
but don't check the responses every

1714
01:13:22,071 --> 01:13:25,610
three minutes for the next six hours.
I'm like a fucking maniac.

1715
01:13:25,860 --> 01:13:26,990
Yeah.
It's a,

1716
01:13:27,290 --> 01:13:28,490
it's a matter of,
I guess,

1717
01:13:28,491 --> 01:13:31,130
rationing,
rationing some of the,

1718
01:13:31,730 --> 01:13:35,750
some of that social media stuff are
rationing some of that online

1719
01:13:35,751 --> 01:13:40,070
interaction with other people.
I feel like as time has gone on,

1720
01:13:40,130 --> 01:13:43,010
I've,
I've gotten much more of my online

1721
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:48,040
interaction in like an educational forum
in terms of like interesting articles,

1722
01:13:48,851 --> 01:13:50,120
right?
Science things,

1723
01:13:50,390 --> 01:13:55,250
things that don't involve like a social
interaction or opinion as much as they

1724
01:13:55,251 --> 01:13:57,370
involve really fascinating facts.
Yeah.

1725
01:13:57,680 --> 01:13:58,513
Like,
um,

1726
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:03,440
something that I've found today,
they think that North America might have

1727
01:14:03,441 --> 01:14:07,190
been settled by humans as much as a
hundred thousand years earlier than they

1728
01:14:07,191 --> 01:14:08,090
thought.
I saw that.

1729
01:14:08,190 --> 01:14:09,230
You see that?
I did.

1730
01:14:09,860 --> 01:14:12,100
It's insane.
Like that

1731
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:15,200
kind of Shit freaks me out.
I love that kind of stuff because that

1732
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:19,600
kind of stuff is just pure curiosity and
pure wonder.

1733
01:14:19,620 --> 01:14:24,610
And the imagination goes wild.
Thinking about what it must've been like

1734
01:14:24,611 --> 01:14:29,050
to be one of these early humans
surviving are trying to survive.

1735
01:14:29,051 --> 01:14:31,060
And if they didn't,
we wouldn't be here.

1736
01:14:31,210 --> 01:14:32,620
And these,
these,

1737
01:14:32,621 --> 01:14:34,390
uh,
mastodon fossils,

1738
01:14:34,690 --> 01:14:37,210
they found them,
the bones were shattered and there's

1739
01:14:37,211 --> 01:14:41,380
rocks nearby that do not seem like they
were broad anywhere.

1740
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:46,180
So it was 1992 they were doing highway
construction near San Diego and they

1741
01:14:46,210 --> 01:14:49,270
found these odd looking bones.
And then they started doing these,

1742
01:14:49,271 --> 01:14:50,180
um,
uh,

1743
01:14:50,230 --> 01:14:52,240
studies on them,
and then they found that their mastodon

1744
01:14:52,241 --> 01:14:56,530
bones and they didn't have the ability
to do carbon testing and get a real

1745
01:14:56,770 --> 01:14:59,380
accurate assessment back then,
but now they do.

1746
01:14:59,770 --> 01:15:04,270
And so now when they're checking these
bones and the way these bones had been

1747
01:15:04,271 --> 01:15:07,360
shattered,
they're pretty sure that they had been

1748
01:15:07,361 --> 01:15:09,610
shattered,
purposely like to get to the marrow.

1749
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:10,570
Wow.
Yeah.

1750
01:15:10,780 --> 01:15:11,231
So that,
yeah,

1751
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:13,900
that's a great example of a,
a positive benefit.

1752
01:15:13,901 --> 01:15:15,890
Yesterday I,
uh,

1753
01:15:16,740 --> 01:15:19,060
I,
I meditated for about 80 minutes or so,

1754
01:15:19,061 --> 01:15:19,894
and then I,
and I,

1755
01:15:19,900 --> 01:15:23,110
I sat up afterwards and I clicked on my
phone and open facebook.

1756
01:15:23,111 --> 01:15:27,340
And the first thing I clicked on it,
let's say with a video of a woman in

1757
01:15:27,341 --> 01:15:30,950
slow motion who stuck her ass out the
window of a bus and just shat the

1758
01:15:30,951 --> 01:15:31,784
street.

1759
01:15:34,450 --> 01:15:35,320
And I just,
I just,

1760
01:15:35,730 --> 01:15:37,840
I had to laugh to myself,
man.

1761
01:15:37,841 --> 01:15:39,160
I was just like in the zone,
you know,

1762
01:15:39,161 --> 01:15:41,880
I was in this beautiful place and then
we'll open once I says,

1763
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:46,210
oh my God reminded me of Calvin's one
joke that shitting out of the car at 80

1764
01:15:46,211 --> 01:15:48,190
miles an hour,
that youtube video.

1765
01:15:48,670 --> 01:15:49,450
I think,
yeah,

1766
01:15:49,450 --> 01:15:51,130
I've,
I've definitely seen too many of those

1767
01:15:51,131 --> 01:15:53,260
videos.
I've seen too many videos of people

1768
01:15:53,261 --> 01:15:56,830
getting beat up too.
Too many videos of street fights.

1769
01:15:56,831 --> 01:16:00,910
Too many videos of people like
skateboard accidents where they fucking

1770
01:16:00,911 --> 01:16:03,550
flip and fall on their head.
It's hard to not watch that though.

1771
01:16:03,551 --> 01:16:04,300
Right,
right.

1772
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:05,350
Hard.
Very hard.

1773
01:16:06,940 --> 01:16:09,940
Very,
very hard.

1774
01:16:10,570 --> 01:16:12,010
I mean,
I feel like there's something to be

1775
01:16:12,011 --> 01:16:14,590
learned in those videos.
Like I almost want to show my kids,

1776
01:16:14,591 --> 01:16:16,960
Hey,
don't try to do flips if you don't know

1777
01:16:16,961 --> 01:16:17,410
what you're doing.

1778
01:16:17,410 --> 01:16:20,380
Atlanta in your fucking head.
But you know,

1779
01:16:20,381 --> 01:16:22,210
I mean,
understanding the consequences and

1780
01:16:22,211 --> 01:16:25,150
having someone else do it so you can
learn from them.

1781
01:16:25,151 --> 01:16:26,770
They've already done it.
So here learn,

1782
01:16:26,950 --> 01:16:29,170
this is what,
this is why you don't fuck with a tiger.

1783
01:16:29,380 --> 01:16:30,131
See,
look,

1784
01:16:30,131 --> 01:16:31,510
the guy got killed by the tiger.
Now,

1785
01:16:31,511 --> 01:16:32,980
you know,
this is why you don't do,

1786
01:16:32,981 --> 01:16:36,700
this is why you don't do that.
Like there's gotta be some educational

1787
01:16:36,701 --> 01:16:38,290
value in those.
Ah,

1788
01:16:38,540 --> 01:16:41,200
yeah.
I'm sure that's all I can reach a little

1789
01:16:41,201 --> 01:16:42,880
bit.
Yeah.

1790
01:16:44,650 --> 01:16:46,840
I mean,
we have some pretty strong instincts in

1791
01:16:46,841 --> 01:16:49,750
us to say,
don't fuck with the dumb kids,

1792
01:16:49,751 --> 01:16:50,584
man.
It's like,

1793
01:16:50,740 --> 01:16:55,210
it's almost like dumb kids are there as
educational tools for the survivors.

1794
01:16:55,810 --> 01:17:00,190
It's like you're supposed to see that
one kid poke the tiger and get mauled.

1795
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:01,120
He like,
shit,

1796
01:17:01,121 --> 01:17:04,030
I can't believe he actually broke into
the zoo and now bobby's gone.

1797
01:17:04,470 --> 01:17:05,350
You know,
like bobby,

1798
01:17:05,351 --> 01:17:08,950
like I mean,
that's the Joseph Campbell a story.

1799
01:17:09,050 --> 01:17:10,040
The hero that it

1800
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:13,790
goes all the way back to the one person
who sacrificed their life.

1801
01:17:13,810 --> 01:17:16,370
Yeah.
And got killed by the Predator in front

1802
01:17:16,371 --> 01:17:20,040
of the tribe and so that the tribe could
survive and then they,

1803
01:17:20,060 --> 01:17:22,340
they worshiped that person for doing
that.

1804
01:17:22,750 --> 01:17:23,421
Yeah.
Yeah.

1805
01:17:23,421 --> 01:17:24,740
The,
the hero goes off,

1806
01:17:24,741 --> 01:17:26,690
learns some lesson,
brings it back to the community and

1807
01:17:26,691 --> 01:17:30,350
everybody's better for it.
Or You watch the hero get mauled,

1808
01:17:30,710 --> 01:17:32,690
he's a martyr.
Then you escape.

1809
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:36,700
All the hyenas are eating them.
One of the things we taught or we've

1810
01:17:36,701 --> 01:17:40,220
worked with kids out in the woods was
that we call the natural consequences,

1811
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:40,990
right.
Which,

1812
01:17:40,990 --> 01:17:42,950
which just means that when you do
something,

1813
01:17:42,951 --> 01:17:46,370
something else happens,
there is a natural reaction and it was

1814
01:17:46,371 --> 01:17:48,220
used a lot of times,
um,

1815
01:17:49,340 --> 01:17:52,850
in opposition or instead of of like a,
uh,

1816
01:17:52,910 --> 01:17:54,110
penalty system.
Right.

1817
01:17:54,111 --> 01:17:57,500
So if you do something bad,
we could,

1818
01:17:57,650 --> 01:18:00,380
we could lay this punishment on top of
you.

1819
01:18:00,410 --> 01:18:02,650
Like what kind of stuff I made.
Oh,

1820
01:18:02,660 --> 01:18:04,190
well.
So for example,

1821
01:18:04,191 --> 01:18:05,024
if,
um,

1822
01:18:06,290 --> 01:18:08,720
if somebody was going to harm themselves
or somebody else,

1823
01:18:08,721 --> 01:18:11,140
you got target,
you got to you,

1824
01:18:11,180 --> 01:18:14,840
we put out a tarp and your shoes and
everything will be taken away from you

1825
01:18:14,841 --> 01:18:16,640
and you,
and you couldn't leave the tarp like

1826
01:18:16,670 --> 01:18:18,350
that.
That was where you had to stay because

1827
01:18:18,980 --> 01:18:20,660
you can hurt yourself.
You couldn't hurt anybody else.

1828
01:18:20,810 --> 01:18:22,100
Wow.
Um,

1829
01:18:23,090 --> 01:18:24,050
so that was,
you know,

1830
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:26,690
at some of that to do with their shoes,
ate them.

1831
01:18:26,750 --> 01:18:30,110
No.
What did you put them in your tent or

1832
01:18:30,111 --> 01:18:32,090
under your tongue?
And so they had this day,

1833
01:18:32,091 --> 01:18:34,690
like under a tarp.
Is that the idea or a,

1834
01:18:34,850 --> 01:18:36,040
if it was raining it happened.
No,

1835
01:18:36,050 --> 01:18:38,660
I mean otherwise it's just,
it was just basically a timeout.

1836
01:18:39,650 --> 01:18:41,000
Let's see.
Now you got to stay here.

1837
01:18:41,180 --> 01:18:42,200
You can interact with the group.

1838
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:43,400
You're by yourself,
whatever.

1839
01:18:43,860 --> 01:18:45,320
Uh,
that's actually not the best example,

1840
01:18:45,321 --> 01:18:48,440
but I'll just use it.
So if you swore you could,

1841
01:18:48,470 --> 01:18:53,470
some programs would maybe have a point
system you get penalized for clients.

1842
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:56,690
Yeah,
yeah.

1843
01:18:56,691 --> 01:18:58,730
I mean that wasn't named Sol.
So yeah,

1844
01:18:58,731 --> 01:19:01,880
it wasn't really upheld.
I'm reaching for a good example here.

1845
01:19:02,620 --> 01:19:05,090
What I'm trying to say is that if you do
something Shitty,

1846
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:07,790
generally you heard others around you
and things things happen.

1847
01:19:07,940 --> 01:19:11,510
And so what we tried to show is that if
kids would do something shitty to,

1848
01:19:11,540 --> 01:19:14,120
uh,
pay attention and that they would see

1849
01:19:14,121 --> 01:19:16,430
the harm they're creating themselves by
courier,

1850
01:19:16,431 --> 01:19:18,200
by harming other people rather than just
like,

1851
01:19:18,650 --> 01:19:19,550
you know,
uh,

1852
01:19:20,780 --> 01:19:24,350
in society,
just locking a kid up for breaking the

1853
01:19:24,351 --> 01:19:25,650
law.
Um,

1854
01:19:25,820 --> 01:19:26,690
it would be,
you know,

1855
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:30,050
maybe if you break a window,
you in this other way,

1856
01:19:30,051 --> 01:19:35,051
you would go and actually see and
experience the,

1857
01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:36,860
the,
the shit that other people had to do to

1858
01:19:36,861 --> 01:19:38,130
fix the window and do all that,
you know,

1859
01:19:38,350 --> 01:19:41,200
more repairative type of justice system
rather than like a,

1860
01:19:41,201 --> 01:19:43,470
a penalty punitive,
punitive.

1861
01:19:43,490 --> 01:19:44,151
That's right.
Yeah.

1862
01:19:44,151 --> 01:19:47,090
Right.
So when you did take these kids,

1863
01:19:47,091 --> 01:19:50,750
like what was like the most extreme
example of someone who's like really

1864
01:19:50,751 --> 01:19:52,370
disturbed?
Because I would imagine there would be

1865
01:19:52,371 --> 01:19:54,630
like a big sort of,
uh,

1866
01:19:54,900 --> 01:19:58,460
like there was a lot of variables.
Like some people would be kind of fucked

1867
01:19:58,461 --> 01:20:00,520
up and some people would be really
fucked up.

1868
01:20:00,521 --> 01:20:01,640
It's probably a spectrum,
right?

1869
01:20:01,970 --> 01:20:02,690
Oh,
absolutely.

1870
01:20:02,690 --> 01:20:05,570
Generally speaking,
very few where I would say actually

1871
01:20:05,571 --> 01:20:06,500
fucked up.
Very,

1872
01:20:06,501 --> 01:20:06,900
very,
very,

1873
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:07,730
very,
very few.

1874
01:20:07,730 --> 01:20:09,330
What were,
what was the case with most of them?

1875
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:14,890
Um,
they were kids in families and like

1876
01:20:14,910 --> 01:20:18,720
communities that didn't know how to make
space for and deal with them.

1877
01:20:18,930 --> 01:20:19,830
They didn't,
the mentors,

1878
01:20:19,890 --> 01:20:23,180
they didn't have people to,
didn't have parents that,

1879
01:20:23,181 --> 01:20:25,500
that gave them the right direction.
I don't know.

1880
01:20:25,501 --> 01:20:26,790
You know,
like being a kid is,

1881
01:20:26,940 --> 01:20:29,340
is uh,
you're supposed to test boundaries,

1882
01:20:29,341 --> 01:20:29,670
right?

1883
01:20:29,670 --> 01:20:33,080
It's like that's the part of your
development in your ontogeny that it's

1884
01:20:33,081 --> 01:20:37,080
like you are defining your personality,
you defining who you are and you need to

1885
01:20:37,081 --> 01:20:39,360
test the boundaries.
And um,

1886
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:41,160
you know,
some of the kids made,

1887
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:43,350
uh,
only two.

1888
01:20:43,351 --> 01:20:45,840
I probably worked with at least a
thousand,

1889
01:20:46,290 --> 01:20:49,270
maybe more kids altogether.
Uh,

1890
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:50,970
maybe that's a stretch a lot,
right?

1891
01:20:50,971 --> 01:20:52,200
For a lot,
for a long time.

1892
01:20:52,201 --> 01:20:57,201
And only one I went to bed at night
worried I might get my head kicked in

1893
01:20:57,990 --> 01:20:59,160
just one,
one kid.

1894
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:03,150
And um,
maybe one or two other kids that I

1895
01:21:03,151 --> 01:21:06,570
walked away actually not enjoying being
around them.

1896
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:11,960
Almost every other single one.
It was just like walked away as you do

1897
01:21:12,271 --> 01:21:14,580
about the one that you worried about
getting your head kicked in,

1898
01:21:15,660 --> 01:21:18,480
you know,
just kind of just kind of sat with it

1899
01:21:18,770 --> 01:21:22,500
and there's really nothing easy did,
it was just like initially or through

1900
01:21:22,501 --> 01:21:24,420
the entire experience that was through
the whole thing.

1901
01:21:24,620 --> 01:21:25,740
She,
that was through the whole thing that

1902
01:21:25,741 --> 01:21:27,180
was uncomfortable.
Fuck that.

1903
01:21:27,570 --> 01:21:29,070
What happened to him?
Oh,

1904
01:21:29,071 --> 01:21:30,000
he's doing now?
No,

1905
01:21:30,130 --> 01:21:31,530
I have no idea.
You know,

1906
01:21:31,531 --> 01:21:33,180
there's,
I mean there's laws and there's things

1907
01:21:33,181 --> 01:21:34,740
you don't generally get to stay in
touch.

1908
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:35,611
Oh,
right,

1909
01:21:35,611 --> 01:21:36,820
right.
What was actually at a,

1910
01:21:36,870 --> 01:21:38,700
uh,
a state program.

1911
01:21:38,701 --> 01:21:39,534
So this was,
uh,

1912
01:21:39,910 --> 01:21:42,450
um,
in lieu of a jail sentence that came

1913
01:21:42,451 --> 01:21:42,751
out.
So,

1914
01:21:42,751 --> 01:21:45,630
so this kid was locked up.
Wow.

1915
01:21:45,810 --> 01:21:48,150
What did he do?
I don't remember.

1916
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:51,180
I don't know.
Probably stole a car or beat somebody up

1917
01:21:51,181 --> 01:21:52,014
or,
I don't know.

1918
01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:54,480
He was just super aggressive.
He wasn't,

1919
01:21:54,870 --> 01:21:58,770
no,
but if he had that he had the,

1920
01:21:59,010 --> 01:22:02,610
I had the feeling that he had no empathy
for others pain.

1921
01:22:02,820 --> 01:22:04,950
Right.
And he couldn't feel that that's the,

1922
01:22:05,490 --> 01:22:08,760
that's the only time it ever got any
interaction with any of those kids ever

1923
01:22:08,761 --> 01:22:09,620
got,
you know,

1924
01:22:09,630 --> 01:22:11,130
that that sent chills through me.

1925
01:22:11,220 --> 01:22:12,120
You know,
that was like,

1926
01:22:13,260 --> 01:22:17,010
and maybe maybe I didn't feel in any
practical sense that he was going to

1927
01:22:17,011 --> 01:22:19,440
hurt me,
but I had the sense that if he did,

1928
01:22:19,441 --> 01:22:21,390
he wouldn't care.
Right.

1929
01:22:21,510 --> 01:22:23,270
Oh Wow.
Because there wasn't that connection and

1930
01:22:23,271 --> 01:22:24,540
the same thing we're talking about in a
sense,

1931
01:22:24,541 --> 01:22:26,210
like that's a thing.
Get dropped in a,

1932
01:22:26,220 --> 01:22:30,090
in a group of eight boys or young men.
And,

1933
01:22:30,150 --> 01:22:32,370
uh,
it was so funny,

1934
01:22:32,371 --> 01:22:34,650
like you could,
you know,

1935
01:22:34,651 --> 01:22:36,470
we worked with therapists with
therapists come in,

1936
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:39,390
all this stuff,
but all like the fundamental thing I

1937
01:22:39,391 --> 01:22:42,570
took away from that experience was that
in order for these,

1938
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:46,950
for these guys to grow up and sort of
move on and get going in their lives,

1939
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:49,380
you know,
what they needed was just somebody like

1940
01:22:49,381 --> 01:22:51,900
me to just show up.
Like,

1941
01:22:51,930 --> 01:22:53,760
because we're really not complicated,
right?

1942
01:22:54,380 --> 01:22:56,790
And,
and so just let them air things out and

1943
01:22:56,791 --> 01:23:00,480
talk about better ways to do things and
sort of get some perspective.

1944
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:01,110
Now,
you know,

1945
01:23:01,110 --> 01:23:05,380
we maybe talked about this last time,
but then they'd go home and not

1946
01:23:05,381 --> 01:23:08,380
necessarily have that support anymore
and be back in their old,

1947
01:23:08,730 --> 01:23:11,970
uh,
arena where we're,

1948
01:23:12,060 --> 01:23:12,970
um,
you know,

1949
01:23:12,971 --> 01:23:15,420
they're old friends and their old family
dynamic and all that and it,

1950
01:23:15,430 --> 01:23:16,360
and it,
you know,

1951
01:23:16,361 --> 01:23:18,070
it's hard.
That's a hard way.

1952
01:23:18,071 --> 01:23:23,071
And so I left that whole experience,
just feeling very strongly that a,

1953
01:23:23,620 --> 01:23:27,970
we can as a community and society just
way better with some simple,

1954
01:23:28,090 --> 01:23:30,760
simple changes we can do better at
raising our boys.

1955
01:23:30,790 --> 01:23:34,180
We just can't because done it.
When you have someone that has no

1956
01:23:34,181 --> 01:23:39,181
empathy though,
what can be done to instill empathy in

1957
01:23:39,221 --> 01:23:41,410
someone who lacks it,
if anything?

1958
01:23:41,830 --> 01:23:43,620
So I don't know.
You know,

1959
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:46,900
if you go on that far end of the
spectrum where there's nothing,

1960
01:23:47,170 --> 01:23:49,090
I don't know.
And I don't know if that's possible,

1961
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:52,120
but I do know that it's a muscle we can
practice.

1962
01:23:52,390 --> 01:23:56,680
Empathy is something that we can get
better at and that we can pay more

1963
01:23:56,681 --> 01:23:58,330
attention.
That's fucked up

1964
01:23:58,370 --> 01:24:00,350
young kid without empathy.
Like how,

1965
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:04,550
what,
what sort of motivation do they have to

1966
01:24:04,551 --> 01:24:09,080
gain empathy if they feel like no one
has shown it towards them or I don't

1967
01:24:09,081 --> 01:24:09,420
know.

1968
01:24:09,420 --> 01:24:10,810
So that's,
that's it.

1969
01:24:10,860 --> 01:24:11,693
That's it.
Right.

1970
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:16,020
So the motivation that you,
I believe you could show is for them to,

1971
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:19,230
if they could let you caring about them
really in,

1972
01:24:19,860 --> 01:24:24,860
if they could really feel cared about
and what's incredibly sad but real is

1973
01:24:25,921 --> 01:24:28,440
that I think some people you know,
grow up in,

1974
01:24:28,450 --> 01:24:29,160
in,
uh,

1975
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:33,060
their brains develop,
they develop as humans where they don't

1976
01:24:33,061 --> 01:24:35,220
have that.
And so the actual wiring,

1977
01:24:35,370 --> 01:24:39,840
the actual state to Ha to receive that
isn't there,

1978
01:24:40,410 --> 01:24:43,200
I think that that is possible to gain.
And you know,

1979
01:24:43,201 --> 01:24:45,660
there's been,
what does that a child called it,

1980
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:46,950
you know,
have you heard of that book?

1981
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:48,210
Yeah,
yeah.

1982
01:24:48,270 --> 01:24:50,820
I mean,
I think it's possible in a much,

1983
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:53,370
in a less extreme cases.
Um,

1984
01:24:53,490 --> 01:24:58,490
I mean in a sense that that's kind of a
lot of what I do is help guys become

1985
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:07,100
more empathetic and the not just for the
benefit of others for the benefit of

1986
01:25:10,441 --> 01:25:11,274
themselves.

1987
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:15,600
The reason why I brought this up,
there's a podcast I'm on radio lab about

1988
01:25:15,601 --> 01:25:17,130
Bernie madoff.
Okay.

1989
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:18,360
And,
um,

1990
01:25:18,420 --> 01:25:22,530
where this guy contacted Bernie Madoff,
he sent him letters and then finally

1991
01:25:22,531 --> 01:25:25,620
Bernie madoff called them and they did
this interview together,

1992
01:25:25,621 --> 01:25:29,880
or the way it works in prison,
I guess at least the prison where Bernie

1993
01:25:29,881 --> 01:25:33,630
madoff is,
you get 15 minutes to talk on the phone

1994
01:25:33,780 --> 01:25:37,290
and then you have to wait 15 minutes
before he could talk again and then 15

1995
01:25:37,291 --> 01:25:39,600
minutes again.
And so they,

1996
01:25:39,780 --> 01:25:42,420
this is how they did the interview,
like 15 minutes on,

1997
01:25:42,421 --> 01:25:46,200
15 minutes off.
And after a while he sort of gained his

1998
01:25:46,201 --> 01:25:51,201
trust and he went deep into how this
whole deception started and how Bernie

1999
01:25:51,451 --> 01:25:52,740
made off.
If you don't know the whole story,

2000
01:25:52,741 --> 01:25:57,210
burning man off as a guy who had this
gigantic Ponzi scheme and stole billions

2001
01:25:57,210 --> 01:26:01,740
of dollars from people and it's called
Ponzi Supernova is the a radio lab

2002
01:26:01,741 --> 01:26:02,400
episode.

2003
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:03,650
Wow.
And,

2004
01:26:03,651 --> 01:26:06,080
uh,
one of the things that was the most

2005
01:26:06,081 --> 01:26:09,950
chilling was how little empathy he had
towards the people that he ripped off,

2006
01:26:09,980 --> 01:26:11,690
right.
Whose lives had been destroyed.

2007
01:26:11,691 --> 01:26:14,180
His son committed suicide.
Um,

2008
01:26:14,250 --> 01:26:17,240
uh,
people like literally went from having

2009
01:26:17,300 --> 01:26:21,530
all this money to being so broke.
They were like dumpster diving and he

2010
01:26:21,531 --> 01:26:22,880
didn't care.
Didn't give a fuck.

2011
01:26:22,940 --> 01:26:24,020
Yeah.
I mean he,

2012
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:27,140
he,
he had no empathy and he's a monster.

2013
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:27,990
I mean it's,
it's really,

2014
01:26:27,990 --> 01:26:32,990
it's really interesting to see like this
guy's reaction to Bernie madoff's lack

2015
01:26:34,581 --> 01:26:37,370
of empathy and realizing somewhere along
the line like,

2016
01:26:37,371 --> 01:26:39,710
oh,
this guy does not care.

2017
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,290
That was one of the things that the
investigators had said about him,

2018
01:26:42,530 --> 01:26:44,870
that it didn't seem to bother him at
all.

2019
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:46,900
That he had done this to these people
that would,

2020
01:26:46,990 --> 01:26:49,130
what bothered him was that he had gotten
caught,

2021
01:26:50,390 --> 01:26:54,470
but it didn't bother him that these
people had been devastated.

2022
01:26:54,530 --> 01:26:57,710
What bothered him was like that people
had made money,

2023
01:26:57,720 --> 01:27:01,400
weren't giving that money back.
Like he'd called one guy and told him

2024
01:27:01,401 --> 01:27:04,970
the guide made like $9 billion.
He was worth $9 billion,

2025
01:27:04,971 --> 01:27:06,920
rather,
it's 7 billion of it had come from

2026
01:27:06,921 --> 01:27:10,970
Bernie madoff's Ponzi scheme.
And he told me how to give that $7

2027
01:27:10,970 --> 01:27:12,440
billion back.
The guy had a heart attack drown in his

2028
01:27:12,441 --> 01:27:16,100
pool,
which is kind of hilarious because you

2029
01:27:16,101 --> 01:27:18,150
can't live with 2 billion.
Yeah,

2030
01:27:18,860 --> 01:27:19,641
I guess.
Well,

2031
01:27:19,641 --> 01:27:23,150
maybe it's not liquid.
Maybe he couldn't give back the 7

2032
01:27:23,150 --> 01:27:24,260
billion.
Maybe it was impossible.

2033
01:27:24,261 --> 01:27:27,740
It was tied up in real estate and
holdings and this and that and the other

2034
01:27:27,741 --> 01:27:30,110
thing.
But isn't it amazing that one person's

2035
01:27:30,111 --> 01:27:33,980
reality could,
I would love to step into his head for a

2036
01:27:33,981 --> 01:27:35,000
second.
I want you to,

2037
01:27:35,010 --> 01:27:36,620
Bernie made him just to see what it felt
like.

2038
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:40,370
I think that'd be very helpful to be
able to step into that because just to

2039
01:27:40,371 --> 01:27:41,870
see,
I can't picture it.

2040
01:27:42,290 --> 01:27:43,700
I just can't picture it.
Well,

2041
01:27:43,701 --> 01:27:47,240
I could also couldn't picture not being
able to live with $2 billion.

2042
01:27:47,241 --> 01:27:49,130
He like what?
What is it?

2043
01:27:49,910 --> 01:27:52,160
I,
it's that weirdness of the game,

2044
01:27:52,161 --> 01:27:53,040
right?
It's like you,

2045
01:27:53,041 --> 01:27:55,910
you score a hundred points.
You want to score a thousand point score

2046
01:27:55,911 --> 01:27:57,300
thousand.
He wanted score a million score,

2047
01:27:57,301 --> 01:28:00,950
1,000,001 score a billion.
It's like you never stop and people

2048
01:28:00,951 --> 01:28:02,540
never,
they never achieve peace.

2049
01:28:02,541 --> 01:28:04,730
Like that's what I always used to say
about Bill Gates.

2050
01:28:04,731 --> 01:28:08,450
Like why the fuck is Bill Gates still
working out here about him being the

2051
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:11,870
richest and now he's not.
I mean he really did sort of find some

2052
01:28:11,871 --> 01:28:16,790
sort of a balance and now almost all of
his work is done towards humanitarian

2053
01:28:16,791 --> 01:28:17,720
efforts.
He's,

2054
01:28:17,780 --> 01:28:18,980
you know,
he donates a lot of money,

2055
01:28:18,981 --> 01:28:20,420
a lot of charities.
I mean,

2056
01:28:20,421 --> 01:28:25,421
a lot of really good work,
like post his Microsoft career,

2057
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:29,930
which is like really kind of unique that
a guy sort of found his way,

2058
01:28:30,160 --> 01:28:32,420
found his back,
kept a shit load of money.

2059
01:28:32,810 --> 01:28:34,610
Don't get me wrong.
You know,

2060
01:28:34,670 --> 01:28:39,560
apparently he's got some stupid fucking
house with a submarine in the Pacific

2061
01:28:39,561 --> 01:28:42,230
northwest where like if someone tries to
break into his house,

2062
01:28:42,231 --> 01:28:46,290
he could fucking escape in a submarine.
I kayaked by his house one second.

2063
01:28:46,300 --> 01:28:48,380
Jim,
did they let you to secret service

2064
01:28:48,381 --> 01:28:50,510
fucking swarm you and ask you where
you're going?

2065
01:28:50,840 --> 01:28:51,321
Yeah.
Nobody,

2066
01:28:51,321 --> 01:28:52,700
I couldn't see anybody.
They're probably all lunch.

2067
01:28:52,710 --> 01:28:55,460
Are you allowed to just walk by his
house?

2068
01:28:55,550 --> 01:28:56,420
How's that work?
Well,

2069
01:28:56,421 --> 01:28:58,570
it was a private island,
at least the place that I was at.

2070
01:28:58,580 --> 01:29:02,190
I was just told by the guy I was with,
we were actually throwing crab pots

2071
01:29:02,190 --> 01:29:03,480
out of a Kayak and,
um,

2072
01:29:03,870 --> 01:29:06,960
I was just told it was his house.
I don't if it's mean house might have

2073
01:29:06,961 --> 01:29:08,280
been one of his houses,
but,

2074
01:29:08,281 --> 01:29:08,880
uh,
we were,

2075
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:09,690
you know,
I dunno.

2076
01:29:09,690 --> 01:29:12,360
50 yards off shore and it was a private
island,

2077
01:29:12,780 --> 01:29:14,360
private island.
That's when you're,

2078
01:29:14,450 --> 01:29:15,271
yeah.
Paul,

2079
01:29:15,271 --> 01:29:17,610
when you got,
you're on an island,

2080
01:29:17,940 --> 01:29:18,840
you know,
what does an island,

2081
01:29:19,070 --> 01:29:22,040
Tyler Perry,
the guy that makes us shitty movies and

2082
01:29:22,041 --> 01:29:23,870
TV shows those awful shows.

2083
01:29:24,260 --> 01:29:25,590
Tyler Perry.
Yeah.

2084
01:29:25,730 --> 01:29:27,590
He has a private,
now he has a private room where,

2085
01:29:27,950 --> 01:29:30,440
I don't know,
you can't know if you know,

2086
01:29:31,400 --> 01:29:33,200
I actually feel,
uh,

2087
01:29:33,680 --> 01:29:36,320
some sadness for Bernie madoff.
Really?

2088
01:29:36,380 --> 01:29:37,213
Oh yeah,
man.

2089
01:29:38,180 --> 01:29:39,013
I mean,
that's,

2090
01:29:39,290 --> 01:29:41,630
I dunno.
He's as tortured as you know.

2091
01:29:41,720 --> 01:29:43,640
I think it's harder to feel empathy for
him,

2092
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,580
but he's as tortured of human is.
I don't know.

2093
01:29:46,850 --> 01:29:48,410
Pick anybody maybe.
Right?

2094
01:29:48,440 --> 01:29:49,251
Yeah,
maybe.

2095
01:29:49,251 --> 01:29:49,851
Maybe not.
I,

2096
01:29:49,851 --> 01:29:50,191
yeah,
I'm,

2097
01:29:50,191 --> 01:29:51,230
I'm projecting.
I don't know.

2098
01:29:51,231 --> 01:29:53,900
That's a fact,
but I don't know if you,

2099
01:29:53,901 --> 01:29:55,810
if you're hurting that many people,
are you,

2100
01:29:55,870 --> 01:29:57,390
are you kidding me?
Like you,

2101
01:29:57,391 --> 01:29:58,790
you,
you aren't feeling,

2102
01:29:58,910 --> 01:30:00,230
you don't feel all right.
Yeah.

2103
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:01,330
You know,
it's a

2104
01:30:01,680 --> 01:30:02,520
weird line.
Like,

2105
01:30:02,521 --> 01:30:06,150
when do you feel bad for someone?
Do you feel bad for Jeffrey Dahmer?

2106
01:30:06,151 --> 01:30:09,960
Like how did he become that cannibal
murderer guys?

2107
01:30:09,961 --> 01:30:11,190
How did,
how did that happen?

2108
01:30:11,850 --> 01:30:12,720
You know,
like what,

2109
01:30:12,721 --> 01:30:15,240
what causes someone to go from like,
you have a boy,

2110
01:30:15,580 --> 01:30:19,560
what causes someone to go from your cute
little baby boy to being some monster?

2111
01:30:19,590 --> 01:30:20,730
Yeah.
Like how does that,

2112
01:30:21,060 --> 01:30:26,060
what is it about people that makes it
possible for someone to go even not for

2113
01:30:26,940 --> 01:30:29,280
to a monster,
but how about that young boy that you

2114
01:30:29,281 --> 01:30:30,900
were working with?
It had no empathy.

2115
01:30:30,970 --> 01:30:33,350
You worried about sleeping near like,
Woo Hoo.

2116
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:36,570
What happens?
Like the developmental process of a

2117
01:30:36,571 --> 01:30:39,630
human being is way more fascinating to
me,

2118
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:41,850
uh,
as an adult with children than it was

2119
01:30:41,851 --> 01:30:43,650
when I was a young man when I was young
man.

2120
01:30:43,651 --> 01:30:45,360
And I was single and I didn't have any
kids.

2121
01:30:45,361 --> 01:30:47,850
I just thought people were fucked up and
some people weren't.

2122
01:30:48,220 --> 01:30:51,420
The people that are fucked up,
fucked him and death penalty and like

2123
01:30:51,470 --> 01:30:52,660
kicked her ass.
And Yeah.

2124
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:53,940
So I've been obsessed with this.
My,

2125
01:30:53,941 --> 01:30:56,370
all my life has been absolutely like
what,

2126
01:30:56,371 --> 01:30:59,170
what is this process of growing?
Have you ever heard of the novel

2127
01:30:59,171 --> 01:31:02,490
sidharth no,
by Hermann Hesse Hessa I'm not sure how

2128
01:31:02,491 --> 01:31:04,800
to say that,
but it's a classic novel,

2129
01:31:05,010 --> 01:31:06,870
an author from Germany and,
and it,

2130
01:31:06,990 --> 01:31:10,680
it chronicles the life of a young guy
named Sid Arthur.

2131
01:31:11,460 --> 01:31:13,020
But the whole book,
what it is,

2132
01:31:13,021 --> 01:31:16,740
is it goes through his entire life from
when he was born until he dies.

2133
01:31:17,160 --> 01:31:21,270
And in it are these like very specific
stages of life.

2134
01:31:21,271 --> 01:31:21,961
So He's,
you know,

2135
01:31:21,961 --> 01:31:25,650
he's like young wandering years and then
he needs to work.

2136
01:31:25,651 --> 01:31:28,230
So he goes to a city and he learns from
a,

2137
01:31:28,260 --> 01:31:30,930
from a trader and then he needs to learn
about love.

2138
01:31:30,931 --> 01:31:33,650
So he,
so he gets with a prostitute but,

2139
01:31:33,651 --> 01:31:38,580
but all in these big stages and that
book did something to me at an early

2140
01:31:38,581 --> 01:31:39,120
age.

2141
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:42,120
I just got obsessed with this process of
maturing.

2142
01:31:42,121 --> 01:31:44,340
And there's a,
there's a term for it called ontogeny,

2143
01:31:44,700 --> 01:31:48,360
which is the,
the process of an organism's growth over

2144
01:31:48,361 --> 01:31:51,130
their lifespan.
It's just this natural sort of arc,

2145
01:31:51,150 --> 01:31:52,890
a tree.
Then ontogeny of a tree is,

2146
01:31:52,891 --> 01:31:54,750
it is a,
you know,

2147
01:31:54,751 --> 01:31:58,440
a seed that drops and then it sprouts
and then it routes and then it grows and

2148
01:31:58,441 --> 01:32:01,390
then it dies and it,
and it is,

2149
01:32:01,690 --> 01:32:04,390
yeah,
it's been an obsession of mine and you

2150
01:32:04,391 --> 01:32:06,160
know,
getting thrown into that work of working

2151
01:32:06,161 --> 01:32:08,140
with kids and yeah,
it's,

2152
01:32:08,141 --> 01:32:08,974
it's,
um,

2153
01:32:09,470 --> 01:32:10,330
uh,
I'm,

2154
01:32:10,350 --> 01:32:13,600
I'm so fascinated by it and I don't have
obviously any,

2155
01:32:14,370 --> 01:32:15,430
you know,
solid,

2156
01:32:16,030 --> 01:32:17,050
here's how it goes.
But,

2157
01:32:17,500 --> 01:32:20,140
but I've been looking into it for a long
time and,

2158
01:32:20,170 --> 01:32:21,790
um,
I just,

2159
01:32:22,540 --> 01:32:23,560
I think that,
oh,

2160
01:32:23,561 --> 01:32:24,520
anyway,
back to the book,

2161
01:32:24,521 --> 01:32:27,010
the,
I used to read that book out loud to

2162
01:32:27,011 --> 01:32:28,600
these groups of kids I was working on.

2163
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:31,090
We'd sit around a fire at night and I'd
read a novel and it would be out there

2164
01:32:31,091 --> 01:32:33,040
for days.
So you've got the time to read a novel

2165
01:32:33,041 --> 01:32:34,810
out loud.
And,

2166
01:32:34,930 --> 01:32:36,010
uh,
you know,

2167
01:32:36,011 --> 01:32:40,750
it's just something poetic,
not about just the words but about

2168
01:32:40,751 --> 01:32:45,751
watching the life,
someone's life unfold as a whole story

2169
01:32:46,390 --> 01:32:48,070
and watching them,
you know,

2170
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:51,910
I dunno,
grow up and yeah,

2171
01:32:51,911 --> 01:32:54,620
it's just,
it's this weird fascination I have and

2172
01:32:54,621 --> 01:32:58,420
it's specifically because in an all com
and it keeps saying it comes back to

2173
01:32:58,421 --> 01:33:01,270
that time in the woods,
but I only worked with males with boys

2174
01:33:01,390 --> 01:33:03,070
and it wasn't,
I didn't choose to do that.

2175
01:33:03,550 --> 01:33:06,070
I felt like,
do a lot of girls do the same sort of

2176
01:33:06,071 --> 01:33:07,150
therapy?
Yeah.

2177
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:09,510
Yeah.
I think they must go with women too.

2178
01:33:09,511 --> 01:33:12,400
It's probably a problem with men going
out there with girls.

2179
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:14,510
They'll do mixed a leadership group.

2180
01:33:14,510 --> 01:33:17,140
So like a male and a female from,
for both boys and girls.

2181
01:33:17,141 --> 01:33:19,060
But yeah,
there's always a girl with the girls.

2182
01:33:19,740 --> 01:33:20,561
Um,
but yeah,

2183
01:33:20,561 --> 01:33:22,060
man,
I just got obsessed with this.

2184
01:33:22,061 --> 01:33:22,900
What,
what,

2185
01:33:23,320 --> 01:33:24,910
how do we grow up?
What does it look like?

2186
01:33:24,911 --> 01:33:27,190
What's it feel like?
How come it's not happening?

2187
01:33:27,220 --> 01:33:32,080
Cause that's a big part of what I felt
as I looked around is that I think that

2188
01:33:32,081 --> 01:33:36,700
a lot of adult physically adult men walk
around with,

2189
01:33:36,730 --> 01:33:39,950
uh,
parts of themselves that are still in

2190
01:33:39,970 --> 01:33:42,850
their team,
six to 18.

2191
01:33:43,400 --> 01:33:44,140
You know,
like there's,

2192
01:33:44,140 --> 01:33:49,140
there's this human maturation process is
human journey that we all have available

2193
01:33:49,931 --> 01:33:52,660
to us that I,
um,

2194
01:33:53,410 --> 01:33:55,510
you know,
I think we're too busy a lot of times to

2195
01:33:55,511 --> 01:33:57,430
let it actually flow and happen.
Well,

2196
01:33:57,460 --> 01:33:59,770
I think that true,
that's true.

2197
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:03,490
But I also think that there's a
maturation process that comes from

2198
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:04,810
overcoming obstacles.

2199
01:34:04,930 --> 01:34:07,240
I would,
a lot of people just don't encounter,

2200
01:34:07,540 --> 01:34:10,000
they don't encounter difficulty so they
don't learn about them.

2201
01:34:10,001 --> 01:34:12,610
So that's part of it.
But I think that a lot of times,

2202
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:17,890
even if they do encounter difficulty,
they don't let themselves actually feel,

2203
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:20,410
they don't let themselves experience it.
Right.

2204
01:34:20,411 --> 01:34:22,840
Like everybody has shitty things happen
to them.

2205
01:34:22,841 --> 01:34:25,090
But you can keep that shitty thing at a
distance from you.

2206
01:34:25,150 --> 01:34:25,931
You're right,
you can't,

2207
01:34:25,931 --> 01:34:28,390
you can like kind of address it.
You can sort of,

2208
01:34:28,990 --> 01:34:30,280
I dunno,
act out against it,

2209
01:34:30,281 --> 01:34:34,310
but unless you actually feel,
you know,

2210
01:34:34,360 --> 01:34:35,890
I mean,
think about this,

2211
01:34:35,891 --> 01:34:37,760
this gets into things like,
uh,

2212
01:34:38,170 --> 01:34:42,160
trauma and resilience and how people are
able to move on from hardship.

2213
01:34:42,161 --> 01:34:42,994
Right?
And,

2214
01:34:43,660 --> 01:34:45,760
and a lot of the research,
um,

2215
01:34:45,790 --> 01:34:47,290
there's a,
uh,

2216
01:34:47,380 --> 01:34:50,050
psychiatrist called Bessel van der Kolk.
Never heard of him.

2217
01:34:50,080 --> 01:34:51,640
No.
Fascinating dude.

2218
01:34:51,641 --> 01:34:55,570
He's a,
he started working with the va in Boston

2219
01:34:55,630 --> 01:34:56,320
and,
uh,

2220
01:34:56,320 --> 01:34:59,660
worked with returning vets from,
um,

2221
01:35:00,500 --> 01:35:05,500
from Vietnam and then did this whole
lifetime of study about trauma and how

2222
01:35:06,591 --> 01:35:10,610
it comes into humans and how you can
move through it and how can heal it and

2223
01:35:10,611 --> 01:35:11,444
all this stuff.

2224
01:35:11,780 --> 01:35:13,220
And uh,
it,

2225
01:35:14,570 --> 01:35:15,291
it just,
it,

2226
01:35:15,291 --> 01:35:17,520
it basically comes down to,
uh,

2227
01:35:17,930 --> 01:35:21,710
being able like to be more resilient,
to be able to get over things to say a

2228
01:35:21,711 --> 01:35:25,070
death in the family or an attack or an
assault or whatever,

2229
01:35:25,190 --> 01:35:30,190
whatever that trauma could be.
That if you don't allow the body and

2230
01:35:31,431 --> 01:35:34,190
the,
your system to actually go through feel

2231
01:35:34,191 --> 01:35:37,100
and process what's going on,
you lock it up,

2232
01:35:37,580 --> 01:35:39,940
you lock it up,
you like it.

2233
01:35:39,950 --> 01:35:40,783
Uh,
and it,

2234
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:42,920
it doesn't,
I mean,

2235
01:35:42,921 --> 01:35:47,760
it's almost like it gets implanted in
you somewhere and then it just festers

2236
01:35:47,761 --> 01:35:48,620
esters.
And it's,

2237
01:35:49,060 --> 01:35:50,720
and the cool thing is,
is that the,

2238
01:35:50,750 --> 01:35:51,320
you know,
the,

2239
01:35:51,320 --> 01:35:53,600
the science now is,
is showing the,

2240
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:55,940
the very specifics of this.
It's not just,

2241
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:56,900
I mean,
it's still theory,

2242
01:35:56,901 --> 01:35:57,734
right?
But it's,

2243
01:35:58,100 --> 01:36:01,340
um,
so I feel like I got off of what we were

2244
01:36:01,341 --> 01:36:02,174
talking about there.

2245
01:36:02,640 --> 01:36:05,800
Uh,
but yeah,

2246
01:36:05,810 --> 01:36:06,770
I,
I feel like,

2247
01:36:07,970 --> 01:36:10,250
like you said,
being able to overcome things.

2248
01:36:10,251 --> 01:36:11,630
Of course.
Absolutely.

2249
01:36:12,050 --> 01:36:14,710
And part of that is just to me,
um,

2250
01:36:14,780 --> 01:36:16,820
again,
speaking more from a male perspective

2251
01:36:16,821 --> 01:36:17,870
here,
but part of that,

2252
01:36:17,871 --> 01:36:20,390
and I think a lot of what our culture
says is,

2253
01:36:20,391 --> 01:36:22,120
okay,
is let's,

2254
01:36:22,160 --> 01:36:23,930
uh,
horse our way through this.

2255
01:36:24,140 --> 01:36:25,030
Right?
Let's force it,

2256
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:26,990
let's push harder.
Let's,

2257
01:36:26,991 --> 01:36:29,420
let's conquer our fears and our
feelings.

2258
01:36:29,421 --> 01:36:30,380
That's,
let's not address it.

2259
01:36:30,381 --> 01:36:31,160
Let's just push,
right.

2260
01:36:31,160 --> 01:36:34,100
Run through the wall.
Basically we're taking the depressants.

2261
01:36:34,700 --> 01:36:36,080
Well,
right?

2262
01:36:36,081 --> 01:36:37,070
So that's,
that's the thing.

2263
01:36:37,071 --> 01:36:41,450
Then there's this other whole way to,
to get through hardship,

2264
01:36:41,900 --> 01:36:46,340
which is by actually surrendering to it
and letting your in this like brilliant

2265
01:36:46,341 --> 01:36:49,490
system that we have as humans to process
it and get through it.

2266
01:36:49,550 --> 01:36:50,870
Right.
And that's,

2267
01:36:51,380 --> 01:36:54,080
that's a way to wholeness and health in
some ways,

2268
01:36:54,081 --> 01:36:55,100
right?
I think they're both important.

2269
01:36:55,101 --> 01:36:56,150
I mean like,
yeah,

2270
01:36:56,180 --> 01:36:58,070
you need to be able to,
uh,

2271
01:36:58,640 --> 01:37:00,340
you know,
ignore the pain and,

2272
01:37:00,341 --> 01:37:04,130
and power your way up that mountain or,
or save somebody that's getting hurt or

2273
01:37:04,131 --> 01:37:06,710
whatever.
And then there's this other part I think

2274
01:37:06,711 --> 01:37:10,010
that needs to be in balance,
which is accepting what's happening and

2275
01:37:11,060 --> 01:37:15,320
getting through.
I just a way to accept what's happening

2276
01:37:15,321 --> 01:37:16,710
and let your body do what it needs.

2277
01:37:16,760 --> 01:37:18,980
Well,
I also think there's an extreme lack of

2278
01:37:18,981 --> 01:37:22,640
discipline that a lot of people have and
the discipline,

2279
01:37:22,790 --> 01:37:27,050
a lot of it comes from overcoming
difficult obstacles and understanding

2280
01:37:27,051 --> 01:37:29,150
the work that's required to get things
done.

2281
01:37:29,240 --> 01:37:33,230
Making these little leaps and bounds,
making these improvements in your life,

2282
01:37:33,530 --> 01:37:36,440
getting better at things.
I think those things are really critical

2283
01:37:36,441 --> 01:37:37,820
to the human mind.
Yeah.

2284
01:37:38,180 --> 01:37:43,100
I think the mind has desires and one of
the big desires is it has a desire for

2285
01:37:43,101 --> 01:37:45,800
improvement and his desire to achieve
goals.

2286
01:37:46,100 --> 01:37:49,100
And there's a lot of people that these
goals are laid out by other people.

2287
01:37:49,101 --> 01:37:51,530
These goals are like graduating from
third grade,

2288
01:37:51,531 --> 01:37:55,040
graduating from fourth grade,
a lot of shit that you don't want to do.

2289
01:37:55,140 --> 01:37:56,010
So these goals are

2290
01:37:56,010 --> 01:37:58,410
meaningless to you,
so you never feel like you've

2291
01:37:58,411 --> 01:38:00,750
accomplished anything that you actually
want to do.

2292
01:38:00,990 --> 01:38:03,510
And next thing you know what,
you're a 35 year old man working for an

2293
01:38:03,511 --> 01:38:06,120
insurance company.
You don't want to be there and you don't

2294
01:38:06,121 --> 01:38:09,570
have any real part of you that you've
nurtured.

2295
01:38:09,870 --> 01:38:14,870
You just sort of plugged you into these
other weird shapes and conform to them

2296
01:38:15,510 --> 01:38:18,720
and then you just want to go fucking
crazy and probably bitched about it all

2297
01:38:18,721 --> 01:38:20,030
the way along probably.
Yeah,

2298
01:38:20,040 --> 01:38:22,650
you probably complained and you're
annoying and you're a whining little

2299
01:38:22,651 --> 01:38:25,680
twat and you're out there just clogging
up the freeway,

2300
01:38:25,700 --> 01:38:27,720
beep it at people and giving them the
finger.

2301
01:38:27,990 --> 01:38:29,460
I mean,
that's a lot of humans that you run

2302
01:38:29,461 --> 01:38:30,310
into.
That's a lot of,

2303
01:38:30,720 --> 01:38:32,940
it's a lot of this life.
So yeah,

2304
01:38:32,970 --> 01:38:37,080
and that points directly to what you
know I do and what I'm building is,

2305
01:38:37,081 --> 01:38:39,570
is that,
so you take eight of those guys and you

2306
01:38:39,571 --> 01:38:43,980
set up a room and you say,
all right in this space right here,

2307
01:38:44,490 --> 01:38:45,323
fuck all that.

2308
01:38:45,390 --> 01:38:49,770
We're going to be actually honest and
say what we're feeling but maybe can't

2309
01:38:49,771 --> 01:38:52,020
even really access.
So like all that frustration,

2310
01:38:52,021 --> 01:38:53,700
all that shit,
whatever.

2311
01:38:53,701 --> 01:38:56,010
It could be anything that's so hard for
people to do.

2312
01:38:56,011 --> 01:38:56,701
Right?
Like what,

2313
01:38:56,701 --> 01:39:00,810
what kind of techniques do you employ to
get someone like say if you've got some

2314
01:39:00,811 --> 01:39:04,320
guy who was closed off and it's been
bullshitting his way through life and

2315
01:39:04,321 --> 01:39:06,720
then all of a sudden here he is,
this 35 year old guy that's really

2316
01:39:06,721 --> 01:39:07,950
troubled.
It's in a room with you.

2317
01:39:08,270 --> 01:39:12,900
How do you get that guy to open up
safety and safety leading by example and

2318
01:39:12,901 --> 01:39:16,260
being vulnerable by example.
And when somebody says it's part of this

2319
01:39:16,261 --> 01:39:18,060
connection,
like sitting down with somebody that if

2320
01:39:18,061 --> 01:39:20,340
you,
after one of these last retreats,

2321
01:39:20,420 --> 01:39:23,130
one of the guys came up to me and said,
safety is the new Iowasca,

2322
01:39:23,640 --> 01:39:28,640
which is maybe a strange thing to say,
but he said he'd been all over the world

2323
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:31,740
doing drugs,
trying to find growth,

2324
01:39:31,741 --> 01:39:32,850
trying to find himself.

2325
01:39:33,330 --> 01:39:36,600
And when he went home and went to this
retreat and all we did was sit down and

2326
01:39:36,601 --> 01:39:37,500
say,
okay,

2327
01:39:37,650 --> 01:39:39,810
our intention,
all we're doing what we actually are

2328
01:39:39,811 --> 01:39:41,660
doing here is just,
uh,

2329
01:39:41,730 --> 01:39:44,640
making this,
you're not going to be,

2330
01:39:45,240 --> 01:39:48,060
you're going to be supported.
You're not going to be laughed at like,

2331
01:39:48,061 --> 01:39:50,430
like it's a safe space to do it.
And then you just,

2332
01:39:50,450 --> 01:39:53,160
uh,
you dive in and lead by example and that

2333
01:39:53,161 --> 01:39:55,020
example,
like plugs,

2334
01:39:55,470 --> 01:39:59,580
others right into it.
Like it's this amazing like symbiotic

2335
01:39:59,581 --> 01:40:00,940
thing that happens,
right?

2336
01:40:01,260 --> 01:40:05,370
And,
and people just sometimes break open,

2337
01:40:05,371 --> 01:40:08,490
sometimes cracks slowly open.
But you know,

2338
01:40:08,520 --> 01:40:11,310
all of a sudden,
so maybe after 35 years of only being

2339
01:40:11,311 --> 01:40:15,450
other people's program,
you get in touch with what you actually

2340
01:40:15,451 --> 01:40:17,820
feel,
what you actually want and who you

2341
01:40:17,821 --> 01:40:19,560
actually are.
It's just like this fucking,

2342
01:40:19,830 --> 01:40:22,200
it's like Holy Shit.
I think for a lot of people it's really

2343
01:40:22,201 --> 01:40:26,730
difficult to try to do what you actually
want to because you've spent so much

2344
01:40:26,731 --> 01:40:31,731
time rewarding yourself with material
items for these little accomplishments

2345
01:40:32,250 --> 01:40:35,640
that you've,
you've become in debt and you really

2346
01:40:35,641 --> 01:40:38,100
can't escape the system.
I mean,

2347
01:40:38,101 --> 01:40:41,790
that's totally real problem with people.
They have all the car that they're

2348
01:40:41,791 --> 01:40:44,490
leasing,
they have a house that they're renting

2349
01:40:44,491 --> 01:40:46,840
or even worse that they bought and then
they,

2350
01:40:46,841 --> 01:40:48,750
they're stuck and then they don't know
what the fuck to do.

2351
01:40:48,751 --> 01:40:52,320
They have to keep this insurance company
job and they're just rotting them out

2352
01:40:52,321 --> 01:40:53,160
from the inside.

2353
01:40:54,030 --> 01:40:54,780
Totally.
Yeah.

2354
01:40:54,780 --> 01:40:56,880
I mean there's like a whole society
built on,

2355
01:40:57,300 --> 01:41:00,500
on uh,
trying to keep you not who you are in a

2356
01:41:00,510 --> 01:41:01,081
sense.
I think,

2357
01:41:01,081 --> 01:41:02,850
you know,
but so what we're finding,

2358
01:41:02,851 --> 01:41:06,060
which is really amazing,
is that if you stay on that surface

2359
01:41:06,061 --> 01:41:07,830
level,
if you stay on that sort of,

2360
01:41:08,190 --> 01:41:10,430
um,
I don't know,

2361
01:41:10,440 --> 01:41:12,660
like,
so trying to improve yourself

2362
01:41:14,220 --> 01:41:16,770
goes so far,
but it's kind of like an iceberg thing,

2363
01:41:16,771 --> 01:41:20,520
right?
So like if your goal is to make more

2364
01:41:20,521 --> 01:41:21,331
money,
right?

2365
01:41:21,331 --> 01:41:24,330
And here's your goal and you're going
toward it and you and your,

2366
01:41:24,940 --> 01:41:27,060
I dunno,
listen to podcasts or you do all this

2367
01:41:27,061 --> 01:41:28,950
stuff and you try to figure out how to
do it,

2368
01:41:28,951 --> 01:41:29,731
how do I,
how do I do it?

2369
01:41:29,731 --> 01:41:31,560
How did it,
and you keep hitting a wall,

2370
01:41:31,590 --> 01:41:33,150
you keep getting sort of,
uh,

2371
01:41:33,270 --> 01:41:37,650
thrown down and you don't really
understand that underneath meanwhile is

2372
01:41:37,651 --> 01:41:41,130
this massive sort of like pent up shit.

2373
01:41:41,670 --> 01:41:45,660
And if you address that massive pent up
shit,

2374
01:41:45,990 --> 01:41:50,190
then all of a sudden getting to that
goal is a whole different story.

2375
01:41:50,310 --> 01:41:52,590
It's a whole different story.
It's a,

2376
01:41:53,100 --> 01:41:53,933
it's,
um,

2377
01:41:54,480 --> 01:41:58,410
it's like always trimming the,
like if you need to get rid of a tree in

2378
01:41:58,411 --> 01:42:00,960
your yard,
but all you do is every day you chop the

2379
01:42:00,961 --> 01:42:03,300
leaves off the leaves off.
But if you address that,

2380
01:42:03,301 --> 01:42:06,120
the roots,
the deeper stuff and uh,

2381
01:42:06,840 --> 01:42:07,561
you know,
and again,

2382
01:42:07,561 --> 01:42:10,080
there's a stigma against that,
especially for dudes.

2383
01:42:10,081 --> 01:42:11,000
Right?
So there's this,

2384
01:42:11,150 --> 01:42:12,570
like,
guys don't want to go to therapy,

2385
01:42:13,020 --> 01:42:16,910
guys don't want to get into woo hippie
spiritual shift do,

2386
01:42:16,920 --> 01:42:18,810
and they're annoying.
Sure.

2387
01:42:18,990 --> 01:42:21,450
Right.
They don't want to get into it.

2388
01:42:21,780 --> 01:42:22,830
Right,
exactly.

2389
01:42:22,890 --> 01:42:24,480
And I mean,
I don't know.

2390
01:42:24,510 --> 01:42:28,740
I don't know if I pull this off or not,
but I feel fluent than in a like,

2391
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:30,833
you know,
broke.

2392
01:42:30,930 --> 01:42:32,090
Sure.
And fluent in,

2393
01:42:32,180 --> 01:42:32,930
you know,
like I've,

2394
01:42:32,930 --> 01:42:35,590
I've,
I've gone down that spiritual route two

2395
01:42:35,591 --> 01:42:36,690
and,
um,

2396
01:42:36,860 --> 01:42:39,560
well you recognize when the spiritual
route is legitimate and when the

2397
01:42:39,561 --> 01:42:43,910
spiritual route is like a rose as well.
Like sometimes even the spiritual route.

2398
01:42:43,911 --> 01:42:47,420
It's just something that someone has
plugged themselves into to try to find

2399
01:42:47,421 --> 01:42:48,530
some meaning.
Exactly.

2400
01:42:48,531 --> 01:42:50,060
Meanwhile,
it's not authentic.

2401
01:42:50,090 --> 01:42:51,880
Exactly.
Um,

2402
01:42:51,970 --> 01:42:54,110
so how are you doing this if you don't
mind me interrupting?

2403
01:42:54,111 --> 01:42:55,640
Like what?
So you're,

2404
01:42:55,700 --> 01:42:57,440
you're planning on taking guys,
like say,

2405
01:42:57,710 --> 01:43:00,950
say if I'm that 35 year old guy that
works in insurance company for example,

2406
01:43:00,951 --> 01:43:03,440
and I'm just fucked up and I just,
I'm going crazy,

2407
01:43:03,441 --> 01:43:04,850
man,
I need to do something.

2408
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:06,440
Hey,
this seems interesting to me.

2409
01:43:06,740 --> 01:43:09,140
Wilderness therapy.
What does it mean Dan Dodi,

2410
01:43:09,141 --> 01:43:11,220
what does that mean?
How do I get involved in this and how do

2411
01:43:11,221 --> 01:43:12,700
you,
how do you get me out of this regimen?

2412
01:43:12,920 --> 01:43:14,930
Yeah.
So three things we're offering right

2413
01:43:14,931 --> 01:43:16,210
now.
And um,

2414
01:43:16,580 --> 01:43:21,580
the first is a is the wilderness route,
which is a like a six day expedition and

2415
01:43:21,591 --> 01:43:22,970
you can sign up,
pay some money,

2416
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:24,740
and go out in the woods and change your
life.

2417
01:43:24,920 --> 01:43:27,950
Like pretty well climb mountains will go
fishing.

2418
01:43:27,951 --> 01:43:29,060
Well,
uh,

2419
01:43:29,300 --> 01:43:33,080
and all along.
So I'll set up this sense of safety in

2420
01:43:33,081 --> 01:43:37,370
this community and this sense of a
brotherhood.

2421
01:43:37,371 --> 01:43:39,170
And how many guys do you go with,
you know,

2422
01:43:39,171 --> 01:43:41,990
10 or 12 for that?
Just you and these 10 people.

2423
01:43:41,991 --> 01:43:43,820
A couple of the leaders in my couple
leaders,

2424
01:43:44,120 --> 01:43:45,290
right,
because you have to deal with

2425
01:43:45,291 --> 01:43:49,050
interpersonal disputes and all the
nonsense you're going to have to shoot

2426
01:43:49,070 --> 01:43:50,540
likely in shelter.
Right.

2427
01:43:50,720 --> 01:43:52,190
And I'm,
I'm working

2428
01:43:52,190 --> 01:43:52,910
with,
uh,

2429
01:43:52,910 --> 01:43:56,900
some guides to just take care of the
logistical stuff so that I can manage

2430
01:43:56,901 --> 01:43:57,734
the,
the group,

2431
01:43:57,770 --> 01:44:00,110
the group stuff more.
That's one offering.

2432
01:44:00,111 --> 01:44:00,710
That's,
that's,

2433
01:44:00,710 --> 01:44:02,750
that's uh,
that's kind of our capstone offering.

2434
01:44:03,320 --> 01:44:05,990
We're doing weekend retreats and we've
been doing these for the last six months

2435
01:44:05,991 --> 01:44:09,740
and they'd been just catching on fire
about 30 guys at a time,

2436
01:44:10,010 --> 01:44:11,120
uh,
in a lodge,

2437
01:44:11,480 --> 01:44:13,790
been doing them in the Berkshire's.
So out in the woods,

2438
01:44:14,260 --> 01:44:18,950
it's a couple hours from New York City,
30 guys there and just set up sort of an

2439
01:44:18,951 --> 01:44:23,660
intense weekend experience of practicing
this stuff and we'll hike and do trail

2440
01:44:23,661 --> 01:44:24,740
work and,
and all that stuff.

2441
01:44:24,741 --> 01:44:27,530
But more importantly to do with the,
the self,

2442
01:44:27,560 --> 01:44:30,020
you know,
diving into yourself with in the

2443
01:44:30,021 --> 01:44:31,730
presence of other guys,
which is,

2444
01:44:32,410 --> 01:44:33,260
um,
just,

2445
01:44:33,650 --> 01:44:34,700
you know,
I've done therapy.

2446
01:44:34,730 --> 01:44:36,620
I've been in therapy.
I'm not a therapist,

2447
01:44:36,621 --> 01:44:37,950
but,
um,

2448
01:44:38,180 --> 01:44:41,810
when it's been very helpful,
like if you work with a good therapist,

2449
01:44:41,811 --> 01:44:43,250
that really is really good.

2450
01:44:43,250 --> 01:44:47,390
I couldn't recommend it more,
but there's something about this,

2451
01:44:47,391 --> 01:44:51,340
these men's retreats,
which I totally understand sound on

2452
01:44:51,370 --> 01:44:52,800
attractive to a lot of guys.
I just like,

2453
01:44:52,990 --> 01:44:55,310
sounds like a lot of butt fucking yeah,
of course.

2454
01:44:55,910 --> 01:44:57,050
Of course.
That that is,

2455
01:44:57,080 --> 01:45:00,470
that is your,
that is the big first sort of response,

2456
01:45:00,471 --> 01:45:01,210
right?
Well,

2457
01:45:01,210 --> 01:45:02,043
it's,
Huh?

2458
01:45:02,760 --> 01:45:03,810
Tell me more.
We,

2459
01:45:03,960 --> 01:45:06,970
I can be open in the woods.
We what we made a,

2460
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:08,960
uh,
one of our advertising videos for it and

2461
01:45:08,961 --> 01:45:12,110
it just starts out that a guy stands up
and says,

2462
01:45:12,111 --> 01:45:14,570
yeah,
I heard about a men's retreat and I

2463
01:45:14,571 --> 01:45:18,230
thought the first thing I thought was
this is going to be fucking awful.

2464
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:21,170
And so I get it.
But,

2465
01:45:21,380 --> 01:45:22,680
um,
yeah,

2466
01:45:22,790 --> 01:45:27,080
I think we're getting further enough
along where the guys that are going

2467
01:45:27,081 --> 01:45:30,950
through this or are literally coming
back with the most positive feedback

2468
01:45:30,951 --> 01:45:33,050
that I could,
I couldn't write this shit like,

2469
01:45:33,110 --> 01:45:35,810
like changing their lives and just like
literally,

2470
01:45:36,210 --> 01:45:37,790
um,
because it's,

2471
01:45:37,830 --> 01:45:38,391
uh,
you know,

2472
01:45:38,391 --> 01:45:41,180
back to that thing we're,
we're offering a place for them to

2473
01:45:42,260 --> 01:45:45,560
accept a part of themselves that's been
offline for a long time.

2474
01:45:45,790 --> 01:45:47,440
That's a big fucking deal.
It's a really,

2475
01:45:47,441 --> 01:45:48,360
yeah,
it's all,

2476
01:45:48,380 --> 01:45:52,750
it's probably also a big fucking deal to
just separate from the high for a little

2477
01:45:52,751 --> 01:45:57,751
bit and just be outside of cell phone
range and be in the woods and just take

2478
01:45:58,631 --> 01:46:00,970
a big,
deep breath of fresh air and look around

2479
01:46:00,971 --> 01:46:03,550
at the wilderness and just realize that
this is,

2480
01:46:03,640 --> 01:46:05,440
this is reality as well.
And you're,

2481
01:46:05,441 --> 01:46:09,850
you've been plugged into this
civilization reality,

2482
01:46:09,851 --> 01:46:11,350
this,
this city,

2483
01:46:11,351 --> 01:46:16,351
this urban environment,
which is entirely unnatural and is only

2484
01:46:16,451 --> 01:46:19,180
been a real thing for the past couple
hundred years.

2485
01:46:19,181 --> 01:46:24,181
Like literally didn't exist for the
gigantic swath of humanity that,

2486
01:46:24,401 --> 01:46:25,930
that existed before that.

2487
01:46:26,100 --> 01:46:28,770
Yeah.
I think that it isn't the right word.

2488
01:46:28,771 --> 01:46:32,400
They're not really,
I think it does a couple deep things.

2489
01:46:32,401 --> 01:46:33,600
It,
it lights up this,

2490
01:46:33,601 --> 01:46:34,434
this,
um,

2491
01:46:35,020 --> 01:46:38,250
this neurobiology that,
that of us as social animals.

2492
01:46:38,700 --> 01:46:40,470
I think it,
it goes back to,

2493
01:46:40,490 --> 01:46:43,050
um,
more of a tribal sense of living too.

2494
01:46:43,051 --> 01:46:44,240
It's,
it's like all of a sudden you,

2495
01:46:44,250 --> 01:46:46,610
you went from being isolated and lonely
to heaven,

2496
01:46:47,040 --> 01:46:50,700
30 dudes who would honestly fucking do
anything for you in that moment.

2497
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:55,830
And I got a buddy,
a good buddy as a return special forces

2498
01:46:56,550 --> 01:46:58,920
operator and he,
he sits in my men's group in Bozeman

2499
01:46:58,921 --> 01:47:03,921
with me and really struggled with coming
home and then found our group.

2500
01:47:04,591 --> 01:47:07,200
And within a month his life was back on
track.

2501
01:47:07,450 --> 01:47:10,170
Like I like just killing it man.
Just like kicking ass.

2502
01:47:10,740 --> 01:47:13,650
And you know,
I mean there is a connection between,

2503
01:47:13,860 --> 01:47:16,430
I wouldn't say the general military,
but the special forces,

2504
01:47:16,440 --> 01:47:19,620
you know,
you read books and hear about the aspect

2505
01:47:19,621 --> 01:47:21,660
of brotherhood and how they're there for
each other.

2506
01:47:22,070 --> 01:47:24,330
You know,
this is definitely a very different

2507
01:47:24,331 --> 01:47:25,170
venue.
But the,

2508
01:47:25,171 --> 01:47:29,010
I think the bond and connection that
that has created out of it is,

2509
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:30,030
um,
and this is,

2510
01:47:30,060 --> 01:47:30,720
you know,
from,

2511
01:47:30,720 --> 01:47:33,690
from his mouth too,
is it's,

2512
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:35,940
he went,
you know,

2513
01:47:35,970 --> 01:47:39,660
I don't know how many years,
several years in special forces w living

2514
01:47:39,661 --> 01:47:42,480
with in close connection to guys got
thrown home.

2515
01:47:42,630 --> 01:47:46,290
It was all of a sudden isolated and they
came into our group and just had this,

2516
01:47:46,920 --> 01:47:50,700
this closeness again,
and it just Bam,

2517
01:47:50,790 --> 01:47:53,820
just like back to back to killing it.
Wow.

2518
01:47:53,910 --> 01:47:54,960
Yeah.
Yeah.

2519
01:47:54,961 --> 01:47:55,794
It's,
it's,

2520
01:47:56,700 --> 01:47:57,900
I mean,
I've very aware,

2521
01:47:57,930 --> 01:48:01,620
I mean it's,
I've been scared to start speaking about

2522
01:48:01,621 --> 01:48:02,520
this for years,
man.

2523
01:48:02,521 --> 01:48:03,480
I mean,
it's very,

2524
01:48:03,720 --> 01:48:07,410
uh,
to me even I look at advertising for

2525
01:48:07,411 --> 01:48:08,920
similar man's programs and things that

2526
01:48:09,020 --> 01:48:10,340
done it just so turned off.
I'm like,

2527
01:48:10,730 --> 01:48:11,690
go,
seems weird.

2528
01:48:11,960 --> 01:48:15,560
It does seem that people need resets.
You need some sort of recent,

2529
01:48:15,561 --> 01:48:17,180
and we've talked about this before,
about,

2530
01:48:17,181 --> 01:48:20,720
we've both experienced those resets
through psychedelics or,

2531
01:48:20,780 --> 01:48:22,760
or through these hunting trips,
you know,

2532
01:48:22,761 --> 01:48:26,600
and these wilderness trips like,
but I think people get caught up in the

2533
01:48:26,601 --> 01:48:31,100
momentum of their daily existence and
all the requirements of that daily

2534
01:48:31,101 --> 01:48:33,380
existence and they become overwhelming.
You know,

2535
01:48:33,381 --> 01:48:37,130
like we were talking about like the your
lease that you have on your car or your

2536
01:48:37,370 --> 01:48:40,160
mortgage that you have in your house and
the credit card bills that keep coming

2537
01:48:40,161 --> 01:48:43,490
in your student loans,
you need to eventually get to and blah.

2538
01:48:43,520 --> 01:48:46,480
It's a fucking overwhelming grind.
Yeah.

2539
01:48:46,730 --> 01:48:51,730
And sometimes people need something that
removes them entirely from it for a

2540
01:48:51,891 --> 01:48:54,860
certain amount of time that allows you
just the fresh air,

2541
01:48:55,390 --> 01:48:57,410
not,
not just literal flesh air,

2542
01:48:57,411 --> 01:49:02,411
but the metaphorical fresh air of
allowing you to just separate from the

2543
01:49:03,080 --> 01:49:08,080
all these weird influences and all this
weird energy and momentum,

2544
01:49:08,390 --> 01:49:11,810
the momentum of the life that you've
created or that's been created for you,

2545
01:49:11,811 --> 01:49:12,950
that you're sort of trapped in.

2546
01:49:12,980 --> 01:49:14,870
Yeah.
Yeah.

2547
01:49:14,871 --> 01:49:15,704
Man.
Aye.

2548
01:49:15,710 --> 01:49:17,300
Aye Fit.
So that reset thing,

2549
01:49:17,301 --> 01:49:19,270
I mean,
I,

2550
01:49:19,880 --> 01:49:23,410
I think I want a warning is that if you
start getting a reset,

2551
01:49:23,600 --> 01:49:26,800
I mean from my own experience I needed
pretty regularly.

2552
01:49:26,870 --> 01:49:27,371
Yeah.
You know,

2553
01:49:27,371 --> 01:49:30,820
so the actually the biggest goal of,
of this,

2554
01:49:30,880 --> 01:49:35,020
of every man,
the organization I founded is to,

2555
01:49:35,170 --> 01:49:39,340
our goal is to get a million guys in
man's groups because that is the same.

2556
01:49:39,410 --> 01:49:42,640
And it happened.
So this last retreat had 30 guys show

2557
01:49:42,641 --> 01:49:43,474
up.
Um,

2558
01:49:43,780 --> 01:49:48,070
about 20 of them wanted to immediately
get a weekly group

2559
01:49:48,070 --> 01:49:51,100
to,
to basically continuing regularly

2560
01:49:51,101 --> 01:49:53,230
experienced the same thing gets,
it's like a hit,

2561
01:49:53,270 --> 01:49:57,040
you know,
like too about men in this culture where

2562
01:49:57,041 --> 01:49:59,860
there's not a lot of sympathy towards
men that are struggling.

2563
01:50:00,240 --> 01:50:04,420
And it seems like there's this thought
that men are the patriarchy and we're

2564
01:50:04,421 --> 01:50:07,840
dominating the world and we're almost
like sub human.

2565
01:50:08,080 --> 01:50:11,050
We're responsible for all these issues.
So men with issues like,

2566
01:50:11,080 --> 01:50:12,700
Oh,
cry me a fucking river.

2567
01:50:12,820 --> 01:50:15,700
What about women with issues?
What about Trans people with issues?

2568
01:50:15,701 --> 01:50:18,070
What about gay people with issues?
What about black?

2569
01:50:18,100 --> 01:50:19,210
Oh,
Jesus Christ.

2570
01:50:19,360 --> 01:50:23,350
Like a regular white guy with issues
like your issues are bullshit.

2571
01:50:23,380 --> 01:50:24,580
They can't like,
but it doesn't matter.

2572
01:50:24,581 --> 01:50:27,130
You are who you are.
You can't change the fact that you're a

2573
01:50:27,131 --> 01:50:29,500
white guy.
So if you're a white guy with problems,

2574
01:50:29,680 --> 01:50:32,500
nobody gives a fuck.
Can't they see that it all connects

2575
01:50:32,501 --> 01:50:32,830
though?

2576
01:50:32,830 --> 01:50:35,200
No,
they don't see that white makes

2577
01:50:35,201 --> 01:50:38,470
everybody else unhappy too.
When the dope man they don't because

2578
01:50:38,650 --> 01:50:42,490
it's not convenient for their narrative.
The narratives that you're responsible

2579
01:50:42,491 --> 01:50:45,460
for all the problems in the world,
even though you're just Dan Dodi from

2580
01:50:45,461 --> 01:50:46,480
Bozeman,
Montana.

2581
01:50:47,270 --> 01:50:48,101
No,
I get it.

2582
01:50:48,101 --> 01:50:48,911
But it's,
it's so,

2583
01:50:48,911 --> 01:50:53,290
I mean that's one of the most powerful,
so the podcast that I'm launching is a

2584
01:50:53,291 --> 01:50:58,120
self improvement podcasts for guys.
But instead of going to experts and

2585
01:50:58,510 --> 01:50:59,380
saying,
hey,

2586
01:50:59,410 --> 01:51:01,900
you know,
what's the best morning routine that you

2587
01:51:01,901 --> 01:51:03,760
can do?
Designing a routine or whatever.

2588
01:51:04,320 --> 01:51:09,320
I'm talking to regular guys and,
and asking them to share more vulnerable

2589
01:51:10,121 --> 01:51:13,240
than they would normally would because
that's what happens in these scenarios

2590
01:51:13,241 --> 01:51:16,480
is that we learn from each other just to
simple human fucking beings.

2591
01:51:16,770 --> 01:51:18,100
We're just like,
you know,

2592
01:51:18,101 --> 01:51:21,520
like one guy might share that he's
having trouble with his son,

2593
01:51:21,730 --> 01:51:23,200
for example,
with his kid,

2594
01:51:23,201 --> 01:51:24,070
he doesn't know how to do it.

2595
01:51:24,520 --> 01:51:27,000
And you know,
like no matter what,

2596
01:51:27,001 --> 01:51:30,670
I don't care.
Like a bunch of other guys will say

2597
01:51:30,671 --> 01:51:32,350
like,
Holy Shit,

2598
01:51:32,560 --> 01:51:34,630
I thought I was the only one feeling,
you know?

2599
01:51:34,631 --> 01:51:37,480
And it's just all of a sudden you and
it's back this isolation thing,

2600
01:51:37,481 --> 01:51:40,570
you think that your,
I don't think we're fucking special,

2601
01:51:40,600 --> 01:51:43,060
right?
We all think that we're still unique and

2602
01:51:43,061 --> 01:51:45,610
the actual,
if we actually took the time to connect

2603
01:51:45,611 --> 01:51:47,140
with one another,
we'd be like,

2604
01:51:47,170 --> 01:51:49,210
Oh wow,
we have a lot.

2605
01:51:49,960 --> 01:51:53,140
And just that,
just that is enough to,

2606
01:51:53,570 --> 01:51:56,710
uh,
drastically change somebody's Day.

2607
01:51:56,920 --> 01:52:01,540
And what is motivating you to venture
off because you were working for 0.0 is

2608
01:52:01,541 --> 01:52:06,280
big production company and they make no
meat eater and Anthony Bourdain's show

2609
01:52:06,281 --> 01:52:09,550
and all these different shows.
What's motivating you to step away from

2610
01:52:09,551 --> 01:52:12,970
that and start doing this?
This is what I've always wanted to do

2611
01:52:13,390 --> 01:52:17,200
and this is what I've been,
what compels you?

2612
01:52:18,030 --> 01:52:21,060
I want to help guys,
Eh,

2613
01:52:21,670 --> 01:52:22,451
yeah.
I just,

2614
01:52:22,451 --> 01:52:23,980
I,
and I know that I can,

2615
01:52:24,250 --> 01:52:25,900
you know,
even if it's just one guy,

2616
01:52:25,930 --> 01:52:28,870
whatever it is,
but working out there with these kids

2617
01:52:29,170 --> 01:52:30,700
and seeing all of this,
it just,

2618
01:52:30,701 --> 01:52:32,980
it just left me with the,
the deepest,

2619
01:52:32,981 --> 01:52:36,640
deepest satisfaction,
fulfillment,

2620
01:52:36,670 --> 01:52:38,950
satisfaction,
but also a sense of purpose.

2621
01:52:38,951 --> 01:52:40,420
It's like,
and then I tell you what,

2622
01:52:40,421 --> 01:52:40,931
man,
I had a,

2623
01:52:40,931 --> 01:52:44,290
I had a boy,
I had a son last year and when he came

2624
01:52:44,291 --> 01:52:46,460
out and there was something inside me
that said,

2625
01:52:46,461 --> 01:52:49,850
if you don't do,
if you don't act on what you know,

2626
01:52:50,120 --> 01:52:53,030
you can bring,
if fuck you,

2627
01:52:53,060 --> 01:52:54,710
fuck it.
Like this is your key.

2628
01:52:54,810 --> 01:52:57,680
Like,
like there is,

2629
01:52:57,710 --> 01:52:58,960
um,
I dunno,

2630
01:52:58,970 --> 01:53:00,410
I'm also,
you know,

2631
01:53:00,440 --> 01:53:01,280
I was born,
uh,

2632
01:53:01,430 --> 01:53:04,160
a fairly sensitive,
I could feel I was born a sensitive kid,

2633
01:53:04,161 --> 01:53:05,780
right?
I could feel other people's pain.

2634
01:53:06,680 --> 01:53:08,120
And when I'm,
you know,

2635
01:53:08,180 --> 01:53:09,920
working with these kids and now these
men,

2636
01:53:09,921 --> 01:53:11,560
I mean,
I dunno,

2637
01:53:11,610 --> 01:53:13,220
I want,
I want good for people,

2638
01:53:13,520 --> 01:53:15,260
right?
I want good for you.

2639
01:53:15,290 --> 01:53:18,050
I want good for my family and I want
good for,

2640
01:53:18,051 --> 01:53:19,910
I don't know,
I feel connected and I,

2641
01:53:20,030 --> 01:53:21,410
and I want to do it right.

2642
01:53:22,110 --> 01:53:24,390
It's a noble purpose.
I was just curious about like what,

2643
01:53:24,810 --> 01:53:25,291
I mean,
you,

2644
01:53:25,291 --> 01:53:29,190
you have a very promising career in a
lucrative career with 0.0.

2645
01:53:29,191 --> 01:53:33,120
So for you to leave that it has to be
like a really compelling sort of a,

2646
01:53:33,830 --> 01:53:34,371
yeah,
I mean,

2647
01:53:34,371 --> 01:53:39,371
that job and that career was an amazing
wild ride and in some ways felt like,

2648
01:53:41,121 --> 01:53:42,740
uh,
you know,

2649
01:53:42,741 --> 01:53:46,190
a temporary sidebar from what I'm really
meant to do.

2650
01:53:46,191 --> 01:53:46,700
You know,
I've been,

2651
01:53:46,700 --> 01:53:49,040
I've been writing for a long time and
um,

2652
01:53:50,630 --> 01:53:51,830
yeah,
I think that,

2653
01:53:51,831 --> 01:53:54,320
uh,
whatever this thing is that I'm doing

2654
01:53:54,321 --> 01:53:57,050
it,
it chose me somehow or I don't know.

2655
01:53:57,051 --> 01:53:58,800
Maybe that's,
I don't know if that's true or not,

2656
01:53:58,801 --> 01:54:03,350
but I don't know.
How long can you ignore the thing inside

2657
01:54:03,351 --> 01:54:06,800
you that screams at you that says you
have to do this,

2658
01:54:06,801 --> 01:54:08,470
you have to do this or you want to do,
yeah.

2659
01:54:08,490 --> 01:54:09,230
Well,
you shouldn't.

2660
01:54:09,230 --> 01:54:10,460
Yeah.
You definitely shouldn't.

2661
01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:13,590
Yeah.
I mean it's obviously beneficial and so

2662
01:54:13,591 --> 01:54:16,340
obviously something you're compelled to
do and it's obviously something that you

2663
01:54:16,341 --> 01:54:18,770
feel is very fulfilling.
So why ignore it?

2664
01:54:19,040 --> 01:54:20,780
So when do you start this podcast?

2665
01:54:21,200 --> 01:54:22,040
It's out.
It's out.

2666
01:54:22,160 --> 01:54:23,060
It's out.
What's it called?

2667
01:54:23,090 --> 01:54:25,760
It's called the every man podcast.
