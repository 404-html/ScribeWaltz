1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,620
The Joe Rogan experience,

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:03,300
and so when you asked me do I infiltrate,

3
00:00:03,301 --> 00:00:03,780
it's like,

4
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:04,081
no,

5
00:00:04,081 --> 00:00:04,410
do I?

6
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:05,970
Do I watch a steady diet of Fox News?

7
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:06,600
No.

8
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,280
Do I read right when you
decide to all the time?

9
00:00:08,281 --> 00:00:08,730
No.

10
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:11,280
Do I try to read stuff from all over
the world from different points of view.

11
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,490
Why Greg?

12
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:14,700
Because it's interesting.

13
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,180
You don't have to agree with everything
you read and I only say this to people

14
00:00:18,181 --> 00:00:19,014
about comedy,

15
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,810
the people that come and see you and don't
like your politics and then get up in

16
00:00:21,811 --> 00:00:22,644
a huff and fuck off.

17
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,200
I always think you're not sophisticated,

18
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,190
not sophisticated and I don't
mean that in like a smart Aleck.

19
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:28,951
You went to college way.

20
00:00:28,951 --> 00:00:32,970
I mean there are people
who have no education,

21
00:00:32,971 --> 00:00:36,330
who can understand a whole bunch of
ideas at once and see the humor of.

22
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,233
You know what I mean?

23
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:38,811
Well,

24
00:00:38,811 --> 00:00:39,441
there's some people,

25
00:00:39,441 --> 00:00:40,910
there's lines you cannot cross.

26
00:00:40,911 --> 00:00:42,530
Their pea brains won't allow it,

27
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:43,321
but that's what I mean.

28
00:00:43,321 --> 00:00:46,320
Like come on to subject at top limits.

29
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,880
Mostly I find that if you are disagreeing,

30
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:53,700
I remember last year or two years
ago when the election was going,

31
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,940
I did a joke in Eugene or Portland or no,

32
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:57,781
one of the places in Oregon,

33
00:00:57,781 --> 00:00:58,321
it wasn't Eugene,

34
00:00:58,321 --> 00:00:59,190
which is wicked liberal,

35
00:00:59,191 --> 00:01:00,910
but it was a like Klamath.

36
00:01:00,911 --> 00:01:01,050
Well,

37
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:02,100
I don't know where the
fuck it was in Oregon.

38
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:03,480
There was a city in Oregon and uh,

39
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:08,310
I said something I said to the Republican
nominees aren't just the worst group

40
00:01:08,311 --> 00:01:11,010
of nominees I've ever seen from the
Republican Party in my lifetime.

41
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,160
There the roots group of people
I've ever seen in a room,

42
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:14,581
you know,

43
00:01:14,581 --> 00:01:15,780
and started to go through them.

44
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,990
And one was Herman Cain and newcomer
and someone in the back yelled,

45
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:20,170
no.

46
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:21,323
It was like,

47
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:21,601
no,

48
00:01:21,601 --> 00:01:25,440
you don't get to veto jokes and a guy,

49
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:26,100
I'm not kidding.

50
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,960
A Guy wrote me the other day on my email.

51
00:01:27,961 --> 00:01:30,000
Like I take email from
people and I read it.

52
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:30,790
I don't always answer,

53
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,160
but any raw.

54
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:36,030
I was at your show in
Chicago and it was a podcast.

55
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,030
So my pockets is not
advertised as a standup show.

56
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,590
It says podcast,

57
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:41,061
you know,

58
00:01:41,061 --> 00:01:41,570
like,

59
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:43,830
and therefore there's a
different thing that's happening,

60
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,340
it's a lot more real and you know,

61
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:47,220
as you know,

62
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,420
and he wrote me,

63
00:01:48,421 --> 00:01:48,721
he said,

64
00:01:48,721 --> 00:01:49,110
ah,

65
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:52,260
I didn't spend the 20 bucks or whatever
to hear your fucking politics and I

66
00:01:52,261 --> 00:01:54,760
didn't think it was very funny and anyone
that would like to show it would be a

67
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:55,603
halfwit and shit.

68
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:58,470
So normally I would just block.

69
00:01:58,471 --> 00:01:59,130
I mean now,

70
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:00,890
but I thought I'm going to
run him back and I wrote,

71
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:01,920
you're hostile.

72
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:06,930
Tone is not conducive to
discourse and understand this.

73
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,000
You chose to come in
the room and you pay it.

74
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,620
If you'd ask for a refund of the time,

75
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,790
that's another matter.

76
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:12,511
And I go,

77
00:02:12,511 --> 00:02:13,201
and by the way,

78
00:02:13,201 --> 00:02:14,430
after the show's over,

79
00:02:14,431 --> 00:02:18,120
you don't get to email the artist and
ask for your money back because you

80
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:19,920
disagreed with them.

81
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:21,330
You take your chances.

82
00:02:21,331 --> 00:02:24,690
Whether you go to see a symphony or a
movie or a fucking whatever it is you're

83
00:02:24,691 --> 00:02:25,221
going to go see,

84
00:02:25,221 --> 00:02:25,390
man,

85
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:26,670
when you go to Jack in the box,

86
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,620
you might not like them sausages,

87
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,950
but you don't get to fucking write me
after and tell me you want your money

88
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:32,370
back.

89
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:35,790
And then say everyone that liked it was
a moron when he was the only one who

90
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:36,331
didn't like it,

91
00:02:36,331 --> 00:02:36,540
you know,

92
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,290
and it's like,

93
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,430
I don't understand that.

94
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:38,871
Well,

95
00:02:38,871 --> 00:02:42,680
there's always going to be people that
can't wrap their head around the idea

96
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:46,220
that there's different people and
different people like different stuff.

97
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:49,610
And if you don't like something it's okay.

98
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,010
If there are other people enjoying it,

99
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,310
well then you know that's for
them and it's not for you.

100
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,120
But the anger letter like I didn't,

101
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,580
I don't like your politics and fucking
that wasn't very funny and the people are

102
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,730
assholes and just sending that letter,

103
00:03:03,731 --> 00:03:04,564
you're an asshole.

104
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,720
He mean you might want to
tell one of your friends like,

105
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:07,780
I didn't have a good time.

106
00:03:07,781 --> 00:03:09,280
He's talking all this liberal shit.

107
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:10,443
Trayvon Martin.

108
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:11,880
Not yet.

109
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,610
The night I,

110
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:17,610
I did it was the 50th anniversary of
the march on Washington for jobs and

111
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:22,590
freedom and I played a clip of Martin
Luther King speech the part I have a dream

112
00:03:22,591 --> 00:03:23,040
and shit,

113
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,280
you know,

114
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,770
because I didn't think the crowd had
heard it before because a lot of young

115
00:03:25,771 --> 00:03:28,560
people haven't heard it exactly.

116
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:33,010
And everybody listen really intently and
I thought this is what you objected to.

117
00:03:33,011 --> 00:03:38,011
You objected to the biggest cry for
peace in the last fucking 50 years.

118
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:39,740
The,

119
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,510
the idea of getting out of your own way.

120
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,433
That's a big one.

121
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:43,490
How'd you figure that out?

122
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,440
I mean probably the same way you did.

123
00:03:46,441 --> 00:03:46,831
You know what I mean?

124
00:03:46,831 --> 00:03:47,580
I think it's the,

125
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:52,580
it's anybody that's trying to do
anything in art or filmmaking,

126
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:54,931
painting,

127
00:03:54,931 --> 00:03:57,590
whatever it is you find or,

128
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,030
or sports or golf particularly.

129
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:03,090
You find that the tendency
is to try too hard.

130
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:03,900
Right?

131
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,970
You're so you want it so bad,

132
00:04:05,971 --> 00:04:07,140
you don't want to screw up.

133
00:04:07,141 --> 00:04:08,220
You want to get it right.

134
00:04:08,221 --> 00:04:10,230
You want to not embarrass yourself.

135
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,780
And so you wind up trying,

136
00:04:12,781 --> 00:04:13,171
trying,

137
00:04:13,171 --> 00:04:15,600
trying so hard that nothing comes,

138
00:04:15,601 --> 00:04:16,230
you know.

139
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:17,130
And finally,

140
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:18,840
like over over time,

141
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,310
I'm sure this is the same for everybody.

142
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:21,510
You kind of say to yourself,

143
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:21,721
man,

144
00:04:21,721 --> 00:04:23,550
I just have to lighten up
a little bit because when,

145
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,520
when good things happen is
when I'm not trying so hard.

146
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,670
And in many ways I think that's
the hardest thing of all.

147
00:04:29,671 --> 00:04:31,890
I mean obviously what you're
saying about being in the jungle,

148
00:04:31,891 --> 00:04:32,180
you know,

149
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,180
psychedelic juggle,

150
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,570
what that's really all
about is not trying.

151
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:36,901
It's like,

152
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:39,120
it's like the hardest thing
in the world is to say,

153
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:39,960
somebody says to you,

154
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,793
relax,

155
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:42,150
right?

156
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,410
Or be yourself,

157
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,431
just be yourself,

158
00:04:44,431 --> 00:04:44,880
Joe.

159
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,560
You know,

160
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,230
I mean,

161
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:46,680
and,

162
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,680
and yet I think as we
become more professional and
better at what we're doing,

163
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,130
when somebody says to you,

164
00:04:53,131 --> 00:04:54,000
be yourself,

165
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:54,953
you can,

166
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,100
you can,

167
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:56,610
you know,

168
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:00,790
you're not burdened by these false
selves and these things that,

169
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:01,340
uh,

170
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:04,080
that you think you ought
to be or ought to say,

171
00:05:04,081 --> 00:05:06,000
or how you want to look
or what you ought to be.

172
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,340
You've kind of gotten rid of those,

173
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:08,790
you know,

174
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:09,780
over time,

175
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,041
deliberately,

176
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:12,000
very deliberately.

177
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:13,260
And I certainly have,

178
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:13,620
you know,

179
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:13,880
I mean,

180
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,870
I've very deliberately tried,

181
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,213
you know,

182
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:21,210
when I feel myself going that
way to pull back and let go.

183
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:21,960
But,

184
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:26,580
and I think in many ways that's what
any artist does as they become a

185
00:05:26,581 --> 00:05:27,690
professional at what they do,

186
00:05:27,691 --> 00:05:29,700
they learned to kind of
get out of their own way.

187
00:05:29,701 --> 00:05:30,930
And it's the hardest thing of all,

188
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:31,764
I think,

189
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:36,120
and the people we talk about resistance
or the way people screw themselves up,

190
00:05:36,121 --> 00:05:36,954
right?

191
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:39,640
That's how they screw
themselves up is they're in,

192
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:41,280
they're getting in their own way,

193
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:41,820
right?

194
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,290
They're listening to their own bullshit,

195
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:45,060
they're believing it and,

196
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:46,861
and they're.

197
00:05:46,861 --> 00:05:49,020
And they're blocked from
whatever they're trying to do.

198
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:52,890
I'm sure that's what the comics right
when they get on stage and they bomb,

199
00:05:52,891 --> 00:05:53,131
right?

200
00:05:53,131 --> 00:05:53,964
That's what's happening.

201
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:54,450
Yeah.

202
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:56,250
That definitely is a big part of it.

203
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:56,691
The,

204
00:05:56,691 --> 00:05:57,350
the,

205
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,230
the what,

206
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:58,610
what,

207
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:02,990
what I think you're doing that or think
is really cool is that by living your

208
00:06:02,991 --> 00:06:06,470
life and figuring things out and
then documenting and sharing them,

209
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:08,120
sharing them like in a really honest way,

210
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:13,500
we are all providing together
what's basically a direction
manual on how to live

211
00:06:14,121 --> 00:06:17,660
your life and avoid a lot of bullshit
that most people get involved with.

212
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,440
This is right.

213
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,180
This is the stuff they
don't teach you in school.

214
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:24,260
Exactly because they don't know we're
trying to do now is the real problem is

215
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:30,220
the human body and the human mind is
probably the most complicated vehicle that

216
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,540
the world has ever seen.

217
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,010
Forget about all the rocket ships and
all the different things that you have to

218
00:06:37,011 --> 00:06:41,150
go through years and years of school
before they let you fuck with whether it's

219
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:44,660
f 18 fighter jets or helicopters.

220
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:44,930
There's,

221
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:45,180
there's,

222
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,480
I watched a friend get
his pilot's license.

223
00:06:47,481 --> 00:06:51,110
Just studying all aerodynamics
and all these different things.

224
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,650
You have to know to take the test and
winds and you don't have to do shit to be

225
00:06:54,651 --> 00:06:55,484
a person.

226
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:56,360
You're just a person.

227
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:57,021
I mean,

228
00:06:57,021 --> 00:06:59,030
it's way crazier to operate this thing.

229
00:06:59,031 --> 00:07:00,690
I mean it has emotions attached to it.

230
00:07:00,691 --> 00:07:03,170
It can make other people with his penis,

231
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,940
which it likes rubbing.

232
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,470
This is ridiculous.

233
00:07:06,471 --> 00:07:11,471
It's a ridiculous animal
and it's a ridiculous sort
of a thing to try to manage

234
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:15,720
with no help and by you writing
this book and people sharing their,

235
00:07:15,721 --> 00:07:17,680
their own personal experiences and this.

236
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:22,550
One of the things that young
men appreciate the most
about old men is an old man

237
00:07:22,551 --> 00:07:24,440
who will tell you what he did wrong.

238
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,360
Like when I meet young kids and was like,

239
00:07:26,361 --> 00:07:27,140
dude,

240
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:27,973
listen to me.

241
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,090
I'm not going to bullshit you,

242
00:07:29,091 --> 00:07:30,320
but don't do that.

243
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,183
Whatever you do,

244
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:34,160
don't do this one because
that one's stupid.

245
00:07:34,161 --> 00:07:35,330
Of course nobody listens.

246
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,583
People do.

247
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:41,300
But if there's an old expression that
a wise man learns from the mistakes of

248
00:07:41,301 --> 00:07:42,134
others,

249
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,793
makes his own.

250
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:44,331
It was owed.

251
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:45,164
Yeah.

252
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,770
You're a fucking human being.
