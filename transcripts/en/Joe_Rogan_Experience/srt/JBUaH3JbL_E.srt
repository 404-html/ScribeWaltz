1
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,320
You guys hear that?
Yeah,

2
00:00:18,321 --> 00:00:20,360
that's it.
That's the brain.

3
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:24,440
That's how hard it's raining here.
All these posts he's telling you,

4
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:25,580
don't,
don't,

5
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,220
don't mow your lawn.
Don't move.

6
00:00:28,221 --> 00:00:30,590
Don't water the lawn.
Don't feel the pool.

7
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:34,520
We're run out of water.
We're running out of water here in

8
00:00:34,521 --> 00:00:35,980
California.
Not Anymore.

9
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:37,430
Motherfucker.
It's theirs.

10
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,050
They're evacuating people.
Jamie,

11
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,340
what did,
what did it say on your phone?

12
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:46,090
Evacuate.
Sacramento's fucked the dam is blowing.

13
00:00:46,491 --> 00:00:49,030
Frank is steal the damn.
Uh,

14
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:53,810
I usually don't introduce guests,
but this gentlemen across me here is,

15
00:00:53,811 --> 00:00:55,040
uh,
I'm really proud of you.

16
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:56,503
Thank you.

17
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:02,480
Frank.
Istio if you go to his instagram page,

18
00:01:02,481 --> 00:01:04,670
let me just tell everybody.
He just one roast battle on comedy

19
00:01:04,671 --> 00:01:05,630
central,
which,

20
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:07,040
uh,
with standup Comedians,

21
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:09,320
that's a huge deal.
I mean that is,

22
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,840
that's a big deal.
That shows a big deal.

23
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,560
It's a big deal for comedy,
but it's a big deal.

24
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:17,630
You want.
And if you go to your instagram page,

25
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,730
dude,
it's so inspirational.

26
00:01:19,731 --> 00:01:22,250
You do.
The shittiest fucking shows are out

27
00:01:22,251 --> 00:01:25,610
there doing bowling alleys.
You're out there doing like bars with

28
00:01:25,611 --> 00:01:27,710
three people in them and you're doing
three,

29
00:01:27,711 --> 00:01:30,020
four a night.
You're just always hammering it.

30
00:01:30,021 --> 00:01:32,850
I love it.
And then to see you do that and to see

31
00:01:32,851 --> 00:01:37,760
you working at the store like many other
people before like Dunkin's done like

32
00:01:37,761 --> 00:01:39,230
Ari's done.
Like rent is easy.

33
00:01:39,231 --> 00:01:41,150
He's done.
Like so many people have gone from

34
00:01:41,151 --> 00:01:41,990
working at the store.

35
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:43,900
Bobby Lee I think worked at the store.
Yep.

36
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,780
So many people have gone from working in
the store to making it as a comic to so

37
00:01:47,781 --> 00:01:52,781
to see you go from working at the store,
grinding every night and then Winnie

38
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:57,920
Rose Battle show,
these motherfuckers that trophy here

39
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,320
too.
Dude.

40
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:03,830
It's fucking heavy.
Feel that's legit as fuck to him now.

41
00:02:03,831 --> 00:02:06,710
I get why they don't want people to hand
those out like the second I got it.

42
00:02:06,711 --> 00:02:07,910
I was like,
I get why they,

43
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:09,910
I get it now.
They shouldn't just hand these out the

44
00:02:09,911 --> 00:02:10,910
kits.
It's so powerful.

45
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:12,950
Yeah.
You can't just give a kid a trophy for

46
00:02:12,951 --> 00:02:14,120
nothing.
You got to win.

47
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:15,950
You got to win.
You've got to do it.

48
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,250
And that this show roast battle is one
of the reasons why I came back to the

49
00:02:19,251 --> 00:02:21,670
comedy store.
When I went to see our,

50
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,480
he was doing his a special and he had
decided to film his first comedy central

51
00:02:26,481 --> 00:02:27,500
special at the store.

52
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,230
And I hadn't been in the soar in seven
years.

53
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,910
I hadn't even stepped foot inside of the
place.

54
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,953
And I was like,
well,

55
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:36,720
there's no way I'm missing this.
So I had a,

56
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,570
had a bite,
the bullet,

57
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:39,020
I had to go in there.
And um,

58
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:39,750
I said,
well,

59
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,930
let me just go the night before.
And uh,

60
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,630
Jeff Ross asked me to be one of the
judges that roast battle.

61
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:46,940
And so I was sitting up there and I was
going,

62
00:02:46,941 --> 00:02:48,500
wow,
this is crazy.

63
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:51,890
This is a totally different thing.
Like this was never here seven years

64
00:02:51,891 --> 00:02:52,641
ago.
There was nothing,

65
00:02:52,641 --> 00:02:55,310
anything like it.
It was like really creative writing,

66
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:59,980
really like nasty jokes.
But then everybody's hugging afterwards,

67
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:01,570
you know,
like that's the one,

68
00:03:01,571 --> 00:03:03,400
like one of the rules is like,
after you do it,

69
00:03:03,401 --> 00:03:06,190
you got to hug it out.
Like it was fucking great.

70
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,630
And I was like,
creatively,

71
00:03:07,631 --> 00:03:10,000
this is so inspiring.
And it's so,

72
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:14,050
there's so much life to it that,
and then our specialist had fucking them

73
00:03:14,051 --> 00:03:14,884
back.

74
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,890
It was a,
it's a crazy thing man.

75
00:03:16,891 --> 00:03:20,220
I mean it was just also just having you
show up and just be a part of that.

76
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,340
That was one of those things where like
everyone knew like all the younger

77
00:03:23,341 --> 00:03:24,470
comics,
all the open makers,

78
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,680
cause it started as an open mic.
So when we saw you come in ever,

79
00:03:27,681 --> 00:03:30,180
it was just like,
oh this is different.

80
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,010
Like that's when everyone kind of was
like,

81
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,030
oh things are changing.

82
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:34,571
Yeah.
Man,

83
00:03:34,571 --> 00:03:36,850
things have changed since then.
At the store.

84
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,490
The store is a crazy place now.
It's insane.

85
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,390
Like I've been there,
I started there in 94 and uh,

86
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,790
it was uh,
kind of like,

87
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:47,770
there's something that happened before I
got there.

88
00:03:47,771 --> 00:03:50,140
Like a bomb had gone off and like these
are,

89
00:03:50,141 --> 00:03:52,120
the survivors had just moved back to the
city.

90
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:55,390
It was weird.
It was like the age of kinison had died,

91
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:56,050
you know,
the,

92
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:58,570
and then there was really no one after
him.

93
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:02,740
So like I came in the early nineties and
kinison was like 80,

94
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,740
you know,
like the early eighties to like 86,

95
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:09,720
88.
And then I believe he died in like what

96
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:12,850
did he die in like 1992 or something
like that.

97
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:18,810
He'd already left the store and um,
when I got there it was all these weird

98
00:04:19,421 --> 00:04:23,290
road comics that were like boat acts,
Bowtech's boat acts,

99
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:26,080
you know to boat act is someone who does
a lot of cruise ships.

100
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,210
No disrespect to anybody.
Does cruise ships.

101
00:04:28,211 --> 00:04:30,880
I know there's a lot of comics who
really do love doing cruise ships and

102
00:04:30,881 --> 00:04:32,360
they're really funny comics.
There's,

103
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:34,300
that's not what I mean.
But what I mean is like there's,

104
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,320
there was certain people that didn't
work anywhere else but like really

105
00:04:39,371 --> 00:04:42,430
shitty gigs and there was a lot of them
at the store and I was like,

106
00:04:42,431 --> 00:04:44,170
this is so weird.
I thought it was going to be like

107
00:04:44,171 --> 00:04:47,260
Richard Pryor and you know Louie
Anderson.

108
00:04:47,261 --> 00:04:49,660
I thought it was just going to be killer
after killer after killer.

109
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,510
It wasn't like that.
But it is now.

110
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,880
This is the time.
It is.

111
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:57,390
Some of those lineups are the absolute
craziest,

112
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,650
like it's ridiculous.
Chris Taleah Bill Burger,

113
00:04:59,651 --> 00:05:01,150
like what?
Over and over again.

114
00:05:01,151 --> 00:05:03,700
This killer after killer of to kill her
Moshe Kasher.

115
00:05:03,701 --> 00:05:05,830
Joey Diaz.
What the fuck man,

116
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:07,450
Tasha was air.
All those guys going up.

117
00:05:07,451 --> 00:05:08,660
It's crazy.
Yeah.

118
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,180
Yeah.
Andrew Santino boom,

119
00:05:10,181 --> 00:05:10,841
boom,
boom.

120
00:05:10,841 --> 00:05:13,480
It's like kill or after killer young
killers.

121
00:05:13,481 --> 00:05:15,010
Older killers.
It's crazy.

122
00:05:15,011 --> 00:05:16,960
Ron White is there now just walking
around.

123
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,591
It's the,
it's,

124
00:05:17,591 --> 00:05:19,960
it's actually insane with us in that
back bar.

125
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:22,330
Yeah.
The elder statesmen of standup comedy.

126
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:25,870
I remember when Ron White came into a
casino I was working at,

127
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,860
I was just,
it was before I moved to Los Angeles for

128
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:29,500
anything.
I was just working in the bar and he was

129
00:05:29,501 --> 00:05:31,150
doing a show there and I remember I was
just like,

130
00:05:31,151 --> 00:05:32,500
oh my God,
I can't believe it's Ryan White.

131
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,720
Yeah.
Matt and I talked to him and then now

132
00:05:34,721 --> 00:05:38,410
it's just so crazy to be like at the
comedy store is sitting in the back

133
00:05:38,411 --> 00:05:40,420
smoking a joint just talking to him
about comedy

134
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,990
dude.
And you know what?

135
00:05:41,991 --> 00:05:43,800
And we started doing the factory again
too.

136
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,930
We did the factory last week and we're
going to do it again next week.

137
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,880
We're going to do the factory on
Wednesday nights.

138
00:05:50,881 --> 00:05:53,910
Every other Wednesday at 10 o'clock.
Yeah,

139
00:05:53,911 --> 00:05:56,250
man.
Because the factory was struggling and

140
00:05:56,251 --> 00:05:57,980
we were like,
the factory is a good

141
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:58,820
club.
It's just,

142
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,580
you know,
it had a lot of weirdness in the past

143
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:04,730
that was connected to it and the store
was always that place to go to.

144
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:07,610
So like,
I think it's important when we see these

145
00:06:07,611 --> 00:06:10,730
clubs that were really lucky to have
that we support them all.

146
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:12,290
Absolutely.
You know,

147
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:14,450
keep them going.
It's cause it's guys like you,

148
00:06:14,451 --> 00:06:16,100
these guys that are coming up,
like you're,

149
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:19,340
you're going to be in the same position
that we're in some day where you're,

150
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:20,340
you know,
you're,

151
00:06:20,341 --> 00:06:24,320
you're capable of like organizing a
night and fill up a room and then it

152
00:06:24,321 --> 00:06:26,600
pumps up the business.
And then guys like you get in,

153
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,940
you know,
like when we did the ice house Wednesday

154
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:29,630
night,
you know,

155
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:32,750
guys like you get in and then you'll be
in that same position someday too.

156
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,820
It's fucking cool to watch,
man.

157
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:37,520
Yeah,
it's absolutely just insane to be a part

158
00:06:37,521 --> 00:06:38,180
of,
you know what I mean?

159
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:41,450
Cause it's like doing,
I got to host when we were at the laugh

160
00:06:41,451 --> 00:06:44,960
factory that Wednesday and that was
bananas cause it was just like meeting

161
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:49,330
the booker and the manager and all these
people and again sick lineup.

162
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,840
Yeah.
And it's just crazy.

163
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:51,950
Yeah.
Yeah.

164
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,010
I know you're getting in your,
you're like at the door.

165
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:55,911
You're,
it's,

166
00:06:55,911 --> 00:06:57,710
I remember those days man,
wasn't it?

167
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,480
I know it was never in a position like
you're in though.

168
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:04,400
Like your position is better than my
position when I was in like your,

169
00:07:04,401 --> 00:07:08,400
your stages of standup because you got
into something through standup.

170
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:13,190
I got into something through a Sitcom,
like a sitcom was like it's okay but

171
00:07:13,191 --> 00:07:15,770
it's not the same.
Like the standup route is the best

172
00:07:15,771 --> 00:07:18,170
route.
It's really odd too because of like just

173
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:20,120
how many people have seen the roast
battle.

174
00:07:20,121 --> 00:07:20,900
Like just the finals.

175
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,720
Like I almost,
I almost feel naive because I didn't

176
00:07:23,721 --> 00:07:28,721
realize how many people were there.
Like it was like winning the combine of

177
00:07:28,761 --> 00:07:31,430
like at the NFL combine,
but for comedy it was,

178
00:07:31,431 --> 00:07:32,690
dude,
it was a big deal.

179
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:36,020
It was a big deal.
It was like guys at the store and girls,

180
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,720
I shouldn't be sexist guys.
The girls and girls at the store.

181
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,390
Um,
we were following it like a sports team.

182
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,400
Like we're following it.
Yeah.

183
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:44,660
I like,
it was crazy.

184
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:45,681
I was like,
who's in the lead?

185
00:07:45,681 --> 00:07:46,760
Who's winning?
Where's he at?

186
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:47,391
You know?
Yeah.

187
00:07:47,391 --> 00:07:50,780
And just the vibe in the room was
absolutely crazy.

188
00:07:50,781 --> 00:07:53,060
Just like hearing,
it was like a sporting event.

189
00:07:53,061 --> 00:07:53,871
It was nuts,
dude.

190
00:07:53,871 --> 00:07:55,520
When I showed up at the store after
you'd won,

191
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,370
it was like,
like we were super bowl champs.

192
00:07:58,630 --> 00:07:59,410
Yes,
Tracy.

193
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:01,490
It was,
people were like crying,

194
00:08:01,491 --> 00:08:03,950
like other comp,
but also me winning was such a weird

195
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:06,800
thing cause it was like,
especially the La comedy community,

196
00:08:06,801 --> 00:08:08,120
I don't wanna say like open miker is
like,

197
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:10,520
it's a terrible term,
but it's like I'm still an open mic or

198
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:10,910
you know what I mean?

199
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:13,390
Like I still hit open mics comic that
does these things.

200
00:08:13,391 --> 00:08:16,760
So it's like when I won,
I had see all these guys that I would

201
00:08:16,761 --> 00:08:19,070
see at these open mics and there was
just like,

202
00:08:19,071 --> 00:08:20,450
it was like we want,
you know what I mean?

203
00:08:20,451 --> 00:08:22,280
Cause it's like they see me at all these
spots,

204
00:08:22,281 --> 00:08:25,730
they know me as the guy that's always
working at the store that's always doing

205
00:08:25,731 --> 00:08:28,340
something.
So it was like a weird sense of pride.

206
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,590
It was like your home team,
but it's also,

207
00:08:30,591 --> 00:08:33,740
it shows you that you can do it.
Like there you,

208
00:08:33,741 --> 00:08:35,450
you're them,
you guys are all working together.

209
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:36,940
You're all doing those open mics
together.

210
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:39,050
They know there's,
there's nothing like you didn't get some

211
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:41,510
Willy Wonka golden ticket and somebody
lets you in.

212
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:42,860
No,
he just hammered it out,

213
00:08:42,861 --> 00:08:44,060
man.
You kept doing it.

214
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,700
You were instagram pages.
That shit man.

215
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:50,120
I really do draw inspiration from it.
I'd love seeing,

216
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:52,160
and I know you're funny too,
which helps.

217
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:54,180
Thank you.
Let's a certain people that I look at

218
00:08:54,181 --> 00:08:56,070
and I go,
well this is this guy or this

219
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:58,020
girl.
All they have to do is not fuck this up

220
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,970
to funny like you got it.
Yeah.

221
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:02,010
And it's like,
it's very important to tell those people

222
00:09:02,011 --> 00:09:04,320
that to like sell them.
You you can do,

223
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:07,920
cause I remember people saying that to
me and it was a shoot like Mark Marin

224
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:10,650
gimme a speech one day after I,
uh,

225
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:15,390
did a show at
the comedy connection in Boston,

226
00:09:15,391 --> 00:09:18,870
which was this little tiny room and he
said some cool shit to me after my set

227
00:09:18,871 --> 00:09:22,590
and I was still raw,
open miker like way rar even than you.

228
00:09:22,591 --> 00:09:23,790
I was like,
how long have you been doing it now?

229
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,890
Uh,
started one was 21.

230
00:09:25,891 --> 00:09:28,860
So I'd say about 27 hours to six years.
But like,

231
00:09:28,861 --> 00:09:31,620
seriously for four,
which is like the pace that I've been

232
00:09:31,621 --> 00:09:33,450
doing it where I'm like hitting my is
trying to go on shows.

233
00:09:33,451 --> 00:09:35,510
I'm really taking it seriously.
Is it harder to do

234
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,470
get cracking in La,
do you think?

235
00:09:37,471 --> 00:09:39,270
Because there's so much comedy here?

236
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,270
I don't think it's hard to get cracking.
I think it's tougher definitely.

237
00:09:43,271 --> 00:09:46,840
But I think if you're willing to work
hard because you're surrounded by,

238
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:49,930
this is something my manager told me
right before I moved because I was

239
00:09:49,931 --> 00:09:53,230
supposed to get a job and then I didn't
and I was really better and I wanted to

240
00:09:53,231 --> 00:09:56,470
move to Los Angeles and he said,
you can move now and find out you're the

241
00:09:56,471 --> 00:10:00,310
shit and things are going to go great,
or you could move now and find out

242
00:10:00,311 --> 00:10:03,460
you're not the shit and then work really
hard and then get really good.

243
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:05,860
And that's what I did.
It's like a good manager.

244
00:10:05,861 --> 00:10:07,000
That's good.
Solid manager.

245
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,351
He was,
I mean he was a,

246
00:10:08,351 --> 00:10:10,630
it was a restaurant manager,
but I mean it was great advice.

247
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:13,500
Wow.
So he doesn't have anything to do with

248
00:10:13,501 --> 00:10:13,960
comedy?

249
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,280
No,
he was just a mall that day.

250
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:19,120
Come to start an agency.
That's why it was so logical.

251
00:10:19,121 --> 00:10:22,990
That's why what he said was so logical.
You never hear that from fucking standup

252
00:10:22,991 --> 00:10:25,240
comedy managers.
They give people the worst advice,

253
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,700
but that's what I did.
I moved here and then it was like,

254
00:10:27,701 --> 00:10:28,381
you know,
people were just like,

255
00:10:28,381 --> 00:10:29,570
oh,
there's no time in Los Angeles.

256
00:10:29,571 --> 00:10:29,891
It's like,
no,

257
00:10:29,891 --> 00:10:31,360
there's time.
If you're willing to make it,

258
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:35,080
like I will drive to have mike sign up,
drive to another mic,

259
00:10:35,081 --> 00:10:36,910
sign up,
drive back to that first.

260
00:10:36,911 --> 00:10:40,100
Mike hit a spot tech.
Someone that's running a show or a house

261
00:10:40,101 --> 00:10:44,110
that I know is going to just toss me up
at the end so I know I could go to that

262
00:10:44,111 --> 00:10:47,260
Mike in two and a half hours while I'm
waiting for this other mic.

263
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:49,690
So it's like,
it's just like,

264
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:52,510
how much are you willing to pay for gas?
You know what I mean?

265
00:10:52,511 --> 00:10:53,410
Like you,
it's really,

266
00:10:53,411 --> 00:10:55,260
you're investing in yourself.
Yeah.

267
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:56,820
Well you are.
You're right.

268
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:57,810
You're also,
you're,

269
00:10:57,811 --> 00:11:00,020
you're definitely investing in yourself,
but you,

270
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:04,280
you're growing in some weird way.
Like when the more sets you do,

271
00:11:04,281 --> 00:11:07,670
your act just kind of grows.
Like sometimes I've done the hat trick

272
00:11:07,671 --> 00:11:08,870
at the store,
we do the main room,

273
00:11:08,871 --> 00:11:10,850
the belly room,
and then the aor or what,

274
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:13,550
whatever order.
By the time you get to that third show,

275
00:11:13,551 --> 00:11:14,750
dude,
you're on fire,

276
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,040
you're just ready to have fun.

277
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:21,120
We just talked and in the groove and
that's where a lot of times new ideas

278
00:11:21,121 --> 00:11:23,160
come from because you're so comfortable
on stage.

279
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,120
Like maybe you're working on a new pit
and out of nowhere this new angle comes

280
00:11:27,121 --> 00:11:28,440
up and it's the best angle of the bed.

281
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,020
It's cause it's just something you've
said.

282
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,730
Yeah,
like offhand

283
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:35,690
saw something super satisfying.
It's about seeing someone work hard and

284
00:11:35,691 --> 00:11:38,810
become successful.
I love seeing people succeed.

285
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:43,520
I can seeing like someone work hard and
then it actually working and then you

286
00:11:43,521 --> 00:11:46,550
see all these people that come up with
excuses and they're always fucking off

287
00:11:46,551 --> 00:11:48,920
and not,
they're not traveling enough,

288
00:11:48,921 --> 00:11:50,750
they're not doing enough sets and not
writing enough.

289
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:52,730
They're sticking with the same old
material for too long,

290
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,680
you know,
come on man.

291
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:57,070
And now it's different because it's like
I'm in a weird position where it's like

292
00:11:57,071 --> 00:11:59,740
most people when something like that and
then we'll turn off their hour or

293
00:11:59,741 --> 00:12:00,850
something.
It's like me,

294
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,270
I'm just a I,
you know,

295
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,920
I'm a door guy so I've got like 15 maybe
20 good minutes.

296
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:09,190
But now's the opportunity for me,
like people ask me to headline somewhere

297
00:12:09,191 --> 00:12:10,300
like some random club.
I was like,

298
00:12:10,301 --> 00:12:14,410
I'm not going to do that.
Like I'll do 20 minutes sets for the

299
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:17,380
next year and a half to build that hour
cause I just want to be a good college.

300
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:20,620
You definitely have to get frantic now
about creating new material and that's

301
00:12:20,621 --> 00:12:23,470
something about those really short sets.
Like a lot of times open mikes,

302
00:12:23,471 --> 00:12:25,390
they give you three minutes,
you know,

303
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:27,910
what do you get three,
sometimes five and then sometimes for

304
00:12:27,911 --> 00:12:29,740
some people giving me a little bit
longer just because you know,

305
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,290
but that's,
it's hard to

306
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,060
come on like that for me.
That's like the setup for a bit

307
00:12:35,061 --> 00:12:36,350
sometimes.
You know,

308
00:12:36,351 --> 00:12:39,860
like you're just getting your,
you're just getting the whole sort of

309
00:12:39,861 --> 00:12:42,200
landscape laid out before you go into a
bit.

310
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:46,280
Kennison used to say that that was a big
thing about Kennison not liking to do a

311
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:48,140
late night shows.
He's just like,

312
00:12:48,141 --> 00:12:50,670
I can't get cooking in five minutes.
You know,

313
00:12:50,671 --> 00:12:54,140
because he was used to doing those.
He would take the late spot at the store

314
00:12:54,141 --> 00:12:55,850
where he would just go as long as he
wanted.

315
00:12:55,851 --> 00:12:58,160
He would have that last spot.
The kinison spot.

316
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:59,560
Yeah.
I mean that's what we call it today.

317
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,310
We call it the Kennison spot.
I've never done it.

318
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,050
Maybe I'd done it like two or three
times,

319
00:13:03,051 --> 00:13:05,000
but I mean,
I haven't done it in like recent years

320
00:13:05,001 --> 00:13:05,450
at all.

321
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:09,860
I got to do one super late spot.
It was the first time I worked a potluck

322
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:11,570
and usually at the rules of,
um,

323
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:14,090
the store,
once you first get hired,

324
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,640
you don't get on friends and family
lists for a few months.

325
00:13:16,641 --> 00:13:19,460
It's something you have to earn a,
that's when I was working there.

326
00:13:19,461 --> 00:13:22,160
So it was like for the first four months
you didn't get any spots you had to keep

327
00:13:22,161 --> 00:13:24,140
working there.
And then eventually the Tachyon potluck

328
00:13:24,141 --> 00:13:27,320
and then if you're good enough to put
you on the name or you put your name on

329
00:13:27,321 --> 00:13:30,200
the list so you have to get up.
So it was my first night working

330
00:13:30,201 --> 00:13:33,380
potluck.
It's one 30 in the morning and the host

331
00:13:33,381 --> 00:13:36,560
is about to finish the show.
And I'm talking to one of the guys,

332
00:13:36,561 --> 00:13:36,921
I'm like,
Hey,

333
00:13:36,921 --> 00:13:37,730
I,
you know,

334
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:39,050
I just got hired here.
I haven't gotten up.

335
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,940
There's still two people here.
There's no paid regulators.

336
00:13:40,941 --> 00:13:43,280
Can I just go up at the end,
do like three or five minutes?

337
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,170
And the manager's looking at,
I was like,

338
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:46,700
whatever,
go ahead.

339
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:47,331
And then,
yeah,

340
00:13:47,331 --> 00:13:51,680
I got to go up three minutes.
Did like potluck at one 30 in the

341
00:13:51,681 --> 00:13:55,220
morning in front of two people.
And that was like the most funniest I've

342
00:13:55,221 --> 00:13:56,310
ever had.
Well,

343
00:13:56,311 --> 00:13:57,560
it's,
you're realizing like,

344
00:13:57,561 --> 00:13:59,480
Holy Shit,
I'm on stage at the comedy store.

345
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,800
Yeah.
That alone.

346
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:04,610
I'm actually behind a mic in front of an
audience at the comedy store where

347
00:14:04,611 --> 00:14:08,120
everyone else has been that's been
falling these exact same footsteps.

348
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:08,831
Yeah.
You know,

349
00:14:08,831 --> 00:14:10,690
this is a conversation that I had,
um,

350
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:15,230
the other day with a another comedian.
We were talking about how there's

351
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:20,910
certain actors,
especially I think actors who will treat

352
00:14:20,921 --> 00:14:22,180
people,
um,

353
00:14:22,181 --> 00:14:24,310
that are like what they call below the
line,

354
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:28,540
like producers and people who are extras
and people who are,

355
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,450
you know,
um,

356
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,510
they're,
they're not caterers,

357
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,060
things like that.
They're not the PR,

358
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,380
they're not,
they're not the executives and they're

359
00:14:35,381 --> 00:14:37,660
not the big top people and the other
actors.

360
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:41,320
So they treat them one way and then the
rest of the folks that work on the set a

361
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:43,300
different way.
Like those people are not equal.

362
00:14:43,301 --> 00:14:44,710
They're,
they're like below the line.

363
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:50,160
And we were talking about how with stand
up everybody at the store is pretty much

364
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,070
like once you working there and once

365
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:54,170
we,
your people like you and you're cool,

366
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,570
we're all the same thing.
Yeah.

367
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:59,120
Like you get that like,
like whether it's Daniel Tosh or you

368
00:14:59,121 --> 00:14:59,960
know,
Bill Burr,

369
00:14:59,961 --> 00:15:02,450
like they'll talk to you like everybody
talks to you that like everybody's the

370
00:15:02,451 --> 00:15:05,750
same because we all know that we are
that person.

371
00:15:05,751 --> 00:15:08,540
Like everybody,
like everybody work in the door that has

372
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:12,020
dreams to become a standup is like me
when I was delivering newspapers or

373
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:14,000
driving limos,
same thing.

374
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,570
We're all the same thing.
Yeah

375
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,210
it's Angela crazy too.
Cause it's like,

376
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:20,660
I mean working at the store,
I mean you put a great point,

377
00:15:20,661 --> 00:15:24,170
like there's definitely a moment where
headliners start taking you seriously

378
00:15:24,171 --> 00:15:29,060
and then treat you like a peer and that
is an awesome moment and just like,

379
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:32,080
it's interesting right when it happens.
Like I remember when like you know,

380
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:35,600
you first started talking to me or like
Jessel knicker like Jeff Ross first like

381
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:40,640
gave me attention just to like talk and
like I could hold their attention like

382
00:15:40,641 --> 00:15:44,990
we like it felt like we were peers and
that's just insane feeling to have as a

383
00:15:44,991 --> 00:15:46,220
young comic for the first time.

384
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,090
Well that's part of the scary thing
about,

385
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:51,610
I think it was probably any,
any endeavor,

386
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:54,010
whether you're,
you want to become a,

387
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:57,490
an artist or a surgeon or whatever the
fuck you want to become.

388
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:00,820
If you have people that you see that are
ahead of you that are already doing it,

389
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,770
it seems like the barrier between you
and them as insurmountable and sometimes

390
00:16:05,771 --> 00:16:08,260
just someone saying something to you,
just someone saying,

391
00:16:08,261 --> 00:16:11,440
look,
everybody starts out as a beginner.

392
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:16,120
There's no instant experts know.
You start out as a beginner,

393
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,000
you don't know what the fuck you're
doing and then eventually you figure it

394
00:16:19,001 --> 00:16:21,460
out.
So everyone you see that is up there.

395
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,960
That is,
that's you.

396
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,880
We're all the same thing.
It's just people,

397
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,800
people in the people that are further
ahead.

398
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,620
You kind of have an obligation to go,
hey,

399
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,470
if you liked the art form,
and I love the art form.

400
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:35,140
I think stand up comedy is like my still
my favorite thing to watch.

401
00:16:35,141 --> 00:16:38,710
How all these years of doing it.
You want more people to succeed.

402
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,401
Oh yeah.
You know,

403
00:16:39,401 --> 00:16:43,090
so this is,
I think there's a greed thing that some

404
00:16:43,091 --> 00:16:45,190
folks possess where they only want to
shine.

405
00:16:45,191 --> 00:16:46,750
They want to be the only person who
shines.

406
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:48,610
So they,
these people coming up,

407
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,860
they're like fucked up.
I mean I'm going to keep these fuckers

408
00:16:50,861 --> 00:16:52,600
down.
Just my boot motherfucker.

409
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,700
You know there's,
there's some of that,

410
00:16:54,701 --> 00:16:56,260
you know,
where they're trying to kick you as

411
00:16:56,261 --> 00:16:57,880
you're trying to climb up behind him.

412
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,660
I've experienced that a few times but I
was,

413
00:17:00,661 --> 00:17:04,950
oh my mom always told me and my dad too,
my mom always said it was one of the

414
00:17:04,951 --> 00:17:07,110
things we were just like,
you treat everyone the way you want to

415
00:17:07,111 --> 00:17:08,820
be treated.
And also you also got to remember,

416
00:17:08,821 --> 00:17:11,270
it's like,
it's like you have to be nice to have

417
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,830
because you never know who's going to be
who you know.

418
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,740
Well you should just be nice cause it
feels good too.

419
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,630
Yeah.
And it's also feels good to them.

420
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:19,790
Feels good to you.
When I go,

421
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,510
sorry,
when I go on home and Mike's and I

422
00:17:21,511 --> 00:17:23,640
always make sure to tag all the guys
running the mix.

423
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,650
Always make sure to say thank you and
stuff.

424
00:17:25,651 --> 00:17:26,251
Cause it's like,
you know,

425
00:17:26,251 --> 00:17:29,370
I'm not the only one and you always got
to try to take care of the people and

426
00:17:29,371 --> 00:17:32,070
bring them up in that cool little
network of social media.

427
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:34,920
You know of tagging peoples instagrams
and you know,

428
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:36,080
and letting people know like

429
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:38,340
on Tuesday nights,
great show,

430
00:17:38,341 --> 00:17:40,710
like all that stuff helps,
helps everybody,

431
00:17:40,711 --> 00:17:42,450
helps the community.
It helps uh,

432
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,030
people who are comedy fans,
like if you're a comedy nerd,

433
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:46,680
Holy Shit,
what a good town to live in.

434
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:48,960
Oh absolutely crazy.
And you,

435
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,130
a lot of them,
you see him like come

436
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:52,560
to the store and sometimes it's like
unnerving because you know,

437
00:17:52,561 --> 00:17:54,600
they've seen your act and you're working
on these new beds.

438
00:17:54,601 --> 00:17:55,351
Like,
oh bitch,

439
00:17:55,351 --> 00:17:58,770
you already seen it's been,
you feel like such a fraud.

440
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,220
That's how I feel every time I go up
with the rose back because I got to go

441
00:18:01,221 --> 00:18:05,430
up every Tuesday at the roast battle.
Then before it was just like audiences

442
00:18:05,431 --> 00:18:07,710
who kind of like have seen the rose pose
to the fans of it.

443
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:10,980
But now it's like,
this is the first week where people came

444
00:18:10,981 --> 00:18:12,630
to see me.
Like they were just like,

445
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,770
oh my God,
we know who you are.

446
00:18:13,771 --> 00:18:16,860
And Moses who runs a show and coach t
both just,

447
00:18:16,861 --> 00:18:17,694
they were like,
you're,

448
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:21,060
you're here to see frank.
It was like a black couple to,

449
00:18:21,061 --> 00:18:23,370
they're like black people like frank,
this is crazy.

450
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,070
But it was just not.
And so,

451
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:29,400
but now it's like there's a pressure
every Tuesday for me to do something

452
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:30,840
new,
to write something new.

453
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,140
You've got to ramp it up,
but you're still working at the store to

454
00:18:34,141 --> 00:18:36,210
you.
I saw you had pictures of you sweeping

455
00:18:36,211 --> 00:18:39,580
up after a roast battle.
That's a great feeling too.

456
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:43,980
I had to put in my two weeks,
sort of like my almost two weeks we'll

457
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:44,843
get you up there.

458
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:48,660
You had to put in my,
I had to tell my boss,

459
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:49,291
I was like,
listen,

460
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:50,340
I was like,
I love working here,

461
00:18:50,341 --> 00:18:53,610
but I'm just getting too busy at nights.
Like I can only work phones.

462
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:55,660
And then I was like,
I gotta go dude,

463
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,520
you know,
standup stuff.

464
00:18:56,521 --> 00:18:57,840
And they were super cool.
They were like,

465
00:18:57,841 --> 00:18:59,150
that's great.
We're really happy for you.

466
00:18:59,151 --> 00:19:01,380
And that just shows that the system's
working at the store.

467
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:04,830
It's the only place that I know of that
really has that system where the

468
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:09,030
employees are all comics.
They're all so it's so weird to fun

469
00:19:09,031 --> 00:19:11,340
place to work because of that.
It's the best man.

470
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:13,290
I mean there's no,
I mean in that picture too,

471
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:15,960
it's one those things where it's like
someone called me and was like,

472
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,090
can you work phones?
And I was like,

473
00:19:18,091 --> 00:19:18,871
yeah,
I'll work phones.

474
00:19:18,871 --> 00:19:22,410
So I worked phones and then I sat in the
main room because someone couldn't make,

475
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:25,070
cause someone was out of town,
sway sat the shift and then every,

476
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:27,540
and then I had to help with the roast
battle cause they do that anyways.

477
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:30,630
It's just part of my job.
So it was like I did all these things

478
00:19:30,631 --> 00:19:34,920
and then I got to do a set and then I
got to judge the roast battle and Tasi

479
00:19:34,921 --> 00:19:36,180
jokes out.
Cause when I judge,

480
00:19:36,181 --> 00:19:39,000
I mostly just write jokes so I can just
say funny things while I'm,

481
00:19:39,001 --> 00:19:41,460
and then we'll let everyone else do like
the critiques and stuff.

482
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:43,560
It's also like who am I?
Right.

483
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:48,390
But I just an opportunity for me to
shine and make funny jokes at the people

484
00:19:48,391 --> 00:19:50,250
battling.
But I mean it,

485
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,930
it's all just in today's work,
you know,

486
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,970
it's all just work.
Well that's the thing about that roast

487
00:19:53,971 --> 00:19:57,390
battle show that's really interesting is
that it's really a joke writer showcase

488
00:19:57,391 --> 00:19:59,500
because everything has to be new.
You,

489
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:02,850
there's no,
you can't use stock jokes and you are,

490
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,760
you're essentially giving an assignment.
Yeah.

491
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,311
You know,
like,

492
00:20:05,311 --> 00:20:07,140
hey Frank Castillo,
this is,

493
00:20:07,141 --> 00:20:08,820
you know,
Bob Smith and you know,

494
00:20:08,821 --> 00:20:11,370
you've got to figure out what's fucked
up about Bob Smith's head.

495
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,220
That one joke he said about that dude,
it will do,

496
00:20:14,221 --> 00:20:16,190
is it his forehead?
Joe's forehead?

497
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,030
Uh,
Joe's foreheads,

498
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,610
Joe's forehead.
It looks like it added a second story on

499
00:20:20,611 --> 00:20:21,990
it.
So it'd be more room to think about

500
00:20:21,991 --> 00:20:22,824
dicks.

501
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:26,950
That kind of shit.
Cause it do,

502
00:20:26,951 --> 00:20:29,730
did have a large forehead,
but like that's something that you have

503
00:20:29,731 --> 00:20:33,750
to think up about that person.
And if you make a regular forehead joke

504
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,250
and it's not going to be like,
it's like,

505
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,001
oh okay cool.
Yeah,

506
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:37,530
he's got a big forehead,
whatever.

507
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,740
But if you make it and add layers,
do what it's more funny.

508
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,710
Yeah.
And he really is a set up punchline

509
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:44,720
format.
Yeah.

510
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,800
I mean it's,
it's it really funny format because it's

511
00:20:47,801 --> 00:20:48,220
a blah

512
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,770
blah,
blah is so blah blah blah.

513
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:51,903
You know,
you can't,

514
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:54,440
there's no ranting.
There's no you really,

515
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:57,670
you only,
you can't go on rants also because

516
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:00,310
you're really only supposed to be
allowed one line.

517
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:03,640
I can sometimes people cheat and they'll
throw like two and three in wwe.

518
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:05,120
That's,
that's the cool thing about it.

519
00:21:05,121 --> 00:21:06,950
It's like,
it's almost like boxing.

520
00:21:06,951 --> 00:21:08,750
That's the beauty of the roast battle
show is like,

521
00:21:08,751 --> 00:21:11,510
it's not only writing,
it's also performance and it's like the

522
00:21:11,511 --> 00:21:12,980
last,
especially in the finals,

523
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:16,610
you can see where like I do some crazy
shit and then it's also,

524
00:21:16,611 --> 00:21:19,670
that's something I learned from Mike
Lawrence and the season one where Mike

525
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:20,091
Lawrence,
season one,

526
00:21:20,091 --> 00:21:23,450
he was one of the only guys to be,
to start the,

527
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:27,350
thank you blah blah blah,
and then go into the joke and then hit

528
00:21:27,351 --> 00:21:28,730
them again.
So it was like,

529
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:32,030
so it's fitting a rebuttal in new your
setup.

530
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:35,030
And then this season I did something new
where it was like,

531
00:21:35,031 --> 00:21:37,730
I knew that if people hit me with the
looks like joke,

532
00:21:37,731 --> 00:21:41,240
they were going to stop and wait for the
laughter and then do the rest of their

533
00:21:41,241 --> 00:21:41,840
joke.

534
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,110
So in my mind I was like,
if I hit them quick with a better looks

535
00:21:45,111 --> 00:21:47,390
like joke,
it'll take the momentum out of that last

536
00:21:47,391 --> 00:21:50,480
joke.
And now it just depends on this joke to

537
00:21:50,481 --> 00:21:51,920
create the momentum.
Right.

538
00:21:51,921 --> 00:21:54,710
So it's like you're playing chess up
there and it's like boxing.

539
00:21:54,711 --> 00:21:56,690
Like it was,
it looks like jokes or just quick jabs

540
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:00,200
and then your big,
big jokes are you're like an haymakers.

541
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,770
Yeah.
There's some mean shit that gets said to

542
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:08,780
all my God.
Like some soul searing shift gears

543
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,880
survive.
But you will be scarred.

544
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,370
You know,
some people are really bro,

545
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:17,270
but fucking hilarious.
It's a weird art form.

546
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:19,160
It's a totally different day.
You know,

547
00:22:19,161 --> 00:22:22,250
like this whole roast battle things a
totally different thing than regular

548
00:22:22,251 --> 00:22:23,084
standing up.
But

549
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,570
Oh yeah.
Regular standup is in it.

550
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,580
Oh yeah.
Cause you still have to like perform.

551
00:22:26,581 --> 00:22:29,220
That's why I like that last battle.
Me and Rashard was so good.

552
00:22:29,221 --> 00:22:32,220
Cause prostart is one of the funniest
dudes I know.

553
00:22:32,221 --> 00:22:35,370
He's a great writer,
super cool dude and an amazing rose

554
00:22:35,371 --> 00:22:37,170
bachelor.
But it's like when you're in that

555
00:22:37,171 --> 00:22:40,020
situation and there's just so much
pressure because it's like you're

556
00:22:40,021 --> 00:22:43,200
getting made fun of,
you have to memorize these jokes because

557
00:22:43,201 --> 00:22:47,490
they had us memorize the two guys.
We pot the guy we were going against and

558
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:49,380
the two possible winners of the other
bracket.

559
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:52,410
Oh how much time did you have to write
these bits?

560
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,410
Uh,
so it was think five days,

561
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:59,340
five days.
You had to write five jokes for jokes.

562
00:22:59,341 --> 00:23:00,990
The first guy,
one possible over time.

563
00:23:00,991 --> 00:23:03,990
And then the finals was five jokes.
One possible over time.

564
00:23:03,991 --> 00:23:08,010
So six trips.
So total you're writing 1820 jokes,

565
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:10,620
not including your looks like or your
quick rebuttals.

566
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:13,050
Holy Shit.
That's a lot of work.

567
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:16,260
Yeah.
And Are you taking like these five out

568
00:23:16,261 --> 00:23:19,990
of a pile of like 20 or 30 like how many
jokes you're actually writing before you

569
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,310
narrow it down?
Usually if it's like for the TV thing,

570
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,320
like it was a,
they let us,

571
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:27,480
like I had my cut man,
which is like my boy Dan Nolan.

572
00:23:27,481 --> 00:23:29,520
He helps you with strategy.
Oh Yay.

573
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:30,660
That's what they did.
Season One,

574
00:23:30,661 --> 00:23:32,130
two.
Well that's what they want to do cause

575
00:23:32,131 --> 00:23:34,410
it's like in the finals they want it to
be a great show.

576
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:36,570
So for me it wasn't like he was riding
me jokes.

577
00:23:36,571 --> 00:23:40,080
It was like we both sat down and I wrote
a bunch of premises and a bunch of

578
00:23:40,081 --> 00:23:42,810
angles and we talked strategy and then
we went from there.

579
00:23:42,811 --> 00:23:44,250
Cause it was like if I'm going to make
fun of Joe,

580
00:23:44,251 --> 00:23:47,450
I can't just be making many gay jokes,
I'm going to get dinged for that.

581
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:51,530
But it's like he's,
that's such a big characteristic of how

582
00:23:51,531 --> 00:23:54,380
he is and how he walks and just like how
he holds himself that it's like you

583
00:23:54,381 --> 00:23:56,520
can't not make jokes about that.
Right.

584
00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:01,750
So it was like if I make jokes about it,
I have to be silly and it has to come

585
00:24:01,761 --> 00:24:04,640
from like a child like ignorance,
you know what I mean?

586
00:24:04,641 --> 00:24:05,710
So I cannot like call him like

587
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:09,040
like a faggot or something like superman
or anything.

588
00:24:09,041 --> 00:24:11,280
I just got it like,
but I could say it was like he loves but

589
00:24:11,281 --> 00:24:12,160
stuff.
You know what I mean?

590
00:24:12,161 --> 00:24:14,800
Like that's just funny and childlike,
you know.

591
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:15,730
I see what you're saying.

592
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:18,240
Yeah.
Like there's a tone that you have to set

593
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:20,430
where you,
you can't be too mean.

594
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,770
No because while you're,
even while you're saying really mean

595
00:24:22,771 --> 00:24:23,450
Shit Zack,

596
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:25,170
cause you can lose the crowd.
Yeah.

597
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,550
But if you can gain their trust to the
point where you've said so many silly

598
00:24:28,551 --> 00:24:31,100
funny things,
that's where at the end you can really

599
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:34,640
earn saying something terrible.
But as long as it's fun.

600
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:39,030
Now is it weird to be doing these rows
battles where you're writing all this

601
00:24:39,031 --> 00:24:42,640
new stuff every week,
but then when you're doing standup

602
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:45,180
you're doing a lot of stuff that you've
already done before?

603
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,760
Yeah.
It is weird in the sense that it's like,

604
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:52,410
it's making me realize that the
different like that I can just,

605
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:54,660
I can create new material.
You know what I mean?

606
00:24:54,661 --> 00:24:57,330
Because especially in high pressure
situations,

607
00:24:57,331 --> 00:25:00,630
but it's like if I give,
if I have a goal or a set a set time,

608
00:25:00,631 --> 00:25:04,350
like I can write new material and now
what I'm realizing is like I can just do

609
00:25:04,351 --> 00:25:06,420
that with my standup.
If I can do that with Rose Battle where

610
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:09,570
I sit down and write all these jokes,
I can do that with writing packets.

611
00:25:09,571 --> 00:25:13,320
I can do that with my standup and it's
just getting up and just doing it.

612
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:15,150
You know what I mean?
Where's that book?

613
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,153
Yeah.

614
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:24,390
This book is the shit after.
People are getting mad at me now from

615
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:27,450
for suggesting this book so much,
but it's called the war of art.

616
00:25:27,451 --> 00:25:31,950
It's by this Guy Steven Pressfield.
And it's essentially about overcoming

617
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:35,360
what he calls resistance,
what most people call procrastination.

618
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:37,350
Oh yeah.
You know that overcoming this,

619
00:25:37,351 --> 00:25:39,690
whatever it is that keeps you from
actually putting in the work.

620
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:40,583
Oh yeah,
absolutely.

621
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:43,140
Yeah.
And he talks about it and he sort of

622
00:25:43,141 --> 00:25:46,440
identifies it and then it gives you
tools to deal with it and explains how

623
00:25:46,441 --> 00:25:49,590
it affected him.
He was essentially just not doing well

624
00:25:49,591 --> 00:25:51,930
at all.
And his life until he was about 40 and

625
00:25:51,931 --> 00:25:53,760
then at 40,
kind of got his shit together and now

626
00:25:53,761 --> 00:25:58,761
he's just a award winning author and uh,
written a bunch of great movies and a

627
00:25:59,101 --> 00:26:02,010
bunch of great books.
He's just very inspirational stuff.

628
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:04,560
But that,
that's what I was kind of getting at.

629
00:26:04,561 --> 00:26:07,350
It's like,
I think that now that you're in this new

630
00:26:07,351 --> 00:26:10,680
spot where everybody knows who you are
or you won the Rose Battle,

631
00:26:10,681 --> 00:26:14,100
you've got all this heat on you.
It's like super important now to take

632
00:26:14,101 --> 00:26:16,260
all that writing to the next level.
Absolutely.

633
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:18,610
Like,
I mean I thought it was busy now herb

634
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,270
before just grinding,
writing these jokes.

635
00:26:20,271 --> 00:26:22,790
Now it's like,
like I walked into levity and the

636
00:26:22,791 --> 00:26:25,940
manager knew me,
like everyone kind of knows who I am in

637
00:26:25,941 --> 00:26:26,774
a sense,
you know what I mean?

638
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:27,740
Not that I'm like,
Oh,

639
00:26:27,741 --> 00:26:29,980
I'm famous on this.
They just know that I did this thing and

640
00:26:29,981 --> 00:26:31,310
then there's a window.

641
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,860
He's got to jump through that window,
you know,

642
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:36,000
because some people miss that window and
it's weird.

643
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:40,140
You'll run into guys that were on last
comic standing a long time ago and they

644
00:26:40,141 --> 00:26:45,141
had a window where things were happening
for them and then it blew away and they

645
00:26:45,631 --> 00:26:47,460
never capitalize.
They never jumped through it.

646
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:50,220
And then some guys like Ralphie may who
jump through it running,

647
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:53,280
you know,
Ralphie may probably worked harder than

648
00:26:53,281 --> 00:26:56,640
anybody after that show was that he was
cranking out dvds,

649
00:26:56,641 --> 00:26:59,160
tour in everywhere.
And uh,

650
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:02,310
he capitalized phenomenally on his time
on the show,

651
00:27:02,311 --> 00:27:04,440
but other people just did not,
they just never really,

652
00:27:04,441 --> 00:27:06,990
never really got a cooking.
But you are,

653
00:27:06,991 --> 00:27:08,310
um,
you know,

654
00:27:08,311 --> 00:27:10,650
you're,
you're like in a great spot like right

655
00:27:10,651 --> 00:27:11,050
now.

656
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:11,771
Yeah.
And that's,

657
00:27:11,771 --> 00:27:12,640
for me,
it's like,

658
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:15,910
I don't plan on stopping.
Like I want to do as many sets as I can.

659
00:27:15,911 --> 00:27:17,920
I'll do it.
I'll still do someone's Quincenera for

660
00:27:17,921 --> 00:27:18,610
20 bucks.
Like,

661
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:19,443
I'll do it.
You really,

662
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,400
man,
get ready.

663
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,630
I'll do whatever,
man.

664
00:27:22,631 --> 00:27:27,280
It's just to have a fake continue era
just to have you over for 20 bucks,

665
00:27:27,281 --> 00:27:28,160
man.
Okay.

666
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,800
One roast battle.
No Mexicans here.

667
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:32,050
Um,
yeah,

668
00:27:32,051 --> 00:27:34,480
I mean but it's just like,
I mean I just want to do stand up.

669
00:27:34,481 --> 00:27:36,490
This is my favorite thing.
Especially like I do,

670
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,280
it does suck that I'm not going to be at
the store as much working there cause

671
00:27:39,281 --> 00:27:43,240
that was one of my favorite things was
just sitting working the door and just

672
00:27:43,241 --> 00:27:46,090
watching all the comics go up.
Cause I really believe the store is a

673
00:27:46,091 --> 00:27:47,500
comedy college.
Yeah,

674
00:27:47,501 --> 00:27:48,400
no it definitely is.

675
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,760
But you graduated from high school and
now you're a moved on into university

676
00:27:51,761 --> 00:27:52,361
life.
Oh,

677
00:27:52,361 --> 00:27:54,220
it's insane.
Yeah.

678
00:27:54,221 --> 00:27:55,450
It's cool.
It's really cool.

679
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,860
This,
this store right now,

680
00:27:56,890 --> 00:28:00,100
um,
I think is a wonderful place for you to

681
00:28:00,101 --> 00:28:04,030
come back to when you're doing other
shows and then start doing shows there

682
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:05,260
as a paid regular,
you know,

683
00:28:05,261 --> 00:28:07,470
once you showcasing it through.
Yeah,

684
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:09,790
I showcased once.
Um,

685
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:12,520
and I can't wait to showcase again.
I think we were talking about this

686
00:28:12,521 --> 00:28:13,930
earlier.
It's like a lot of people come up to me

687
00:28:13,931 --> 00:28:15,580
asking me like,
are you going to be a paid regular?

688
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:17,020
It was one of those things where it's
like,

689
00:28:17,021 --> 00:28:19,000
I want to,
but I want it when it,

690
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:21,090
when I feel I've earned it and I deserve
it.

691
00:28:21,091 --> 00:28:22,930
I want to get it just because of
something.

692
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:24,363
Yeah.
Dude.

693
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:26,650
The funny shit that you wrote on roast
battle,

694
00:28:26,651 --> 00:28:28,070
you could do that all day day.

695
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,860
You could do that all day about,
you can just like pick subjects,

696
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:32,480
you know,
like Rose Trump.

697
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,630
Did you see that new thing that came out
today that,

698
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:36,590
I mean,
not yesterday,

699
00:28:36,591 --> 00:28:40,100
that crazy rant that he went on that
press conference for an hour and a half

700
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:43,520
people,
people that are friends of mine that are

701
00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:48,140
conservatives are scared.
Like I have some buddies of mine that

702
00:28:48,141 --> 00:28:48,771
were like,
dude,

703
00:28:48,771 --> 00:28:50,630
this ain't good.
Like he seems unstable.

704
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:52,430
Oh yeah,
he's going crazy.

705
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,690
My favorite are the people that look at
it and they're just like,

706
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:55,740
no,
that's totally cool.

707
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:56,140
No,

708
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,760
totally fine.
These people were out of their mind.

709
00:28:57,790 --> 00:29:00,460
There was a reporter who,
um,

710
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:04,420
did you see that one reporter,
a Jewish reporter when he tried to shut

711
00:29:04,421 --> 00:29:05,440
him down?
So to sit down?

712
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,400
No,
no,

713
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,790
the reporter that,
um,

714
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:13,120
he was talking about what kind of a
landslide he won the electoral college

715
00:29:13,121 --> 00:29:14,950
by,
and then it's the greatest landslide

716
00:29:14,951 --> 00:29:16,210
ever.
And this guy was like,

717
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,720
absolutely not that April out the stats.
Yeah.

718
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:20,740
I pulled up the stats.
Everybody did better.

719
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,920
Obama did better.
George Herbert Walker did better.

720
00:29:23,921 --> 00:29:26,230
George W did better.
They all did better.

721
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:26,480
Yeah,

722
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,240
I think it was the guy from CNN and then
he ended up calling him CNN.

723
00:29:29,241 --> 00:29:29,660
He's like,
God,

724
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:32,300
now I got a new name for them.
It's very fake news.

725
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:34,090
Well,
I don't know if it's that guy.

726
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:39,270
It's on Patton Oswalt's twitter page.
He retweeted it that someone said about

727
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:42,280
calling

728
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,160
him out on his lies because he says what
the,

729
00:29:45,161 --> 00:29:46,900
you know,
that he won by the biggest landslide

730
00:29:46,901 --> 00:29:48,670
ever.
And then this other guy comes in like

731
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:52,690
someone who,
who's that overt with their ego.

732
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:55,660
Like that's never been a part of the
White House before.

733
00:29:55,661 --> 00:29:57,400
It's,
it's so strange to see.

734
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:02,320
And I just,
I think that it seems like already

735
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:04,350
that's wearing on him.
Oh yeah.

736
00:30:04,351 --> 00:30:06,190
It's like a crazy person.
You could see it.

737
00:30:06,191 --> 00:30:06,611
He,
it's,

738
00:30:06,611 --> 00:30:07,420
it's,
it's,

739
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,250
he's unraveling,
you know what I mean?

740
00:30:09,251 --> 00:30:11,650
And it's also like the people he's got
around him,

741
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:13,750
you know,
it,

742
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:17,380
they're not helping him at all.
He's out a blunt with tobacco on the

743
00:30:17,381 --> 00:30:18,130
outside.
Yes.

744
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:19,180
Oh,
you son of a bitch.

745
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,560
I'm a big fan of blondes.
I only started smoke.

746
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:24,280
I only smoke these a couple of times,
but Charlie Murphy got me on this.

747
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:26,580
Oh Man.
When I grown up in San Jose,

748
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,530
my cousins,
all they did was smoke weed and one of

749
00:30:29,531 --> 00:30:31,060
my cousins,
it was like a thing with him.

750
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:34,120
Whenever I'd roll a blunt,
he'd get mad at me if it,

751
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:39,390
if it wasn't as full as possible.
He get mad.

752
00:30:39,581 --> 00:30:40,061
Yeah.
He'd be like,

753
00:30:40,061 --> 00:30:41,190
dude,
there's too much tobacco I can take.

754
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:43,390
And then I wouldn't like get mad,
but he'd like give me shit.

755
00:30:43,391 --> 00:30:46,630
So like I had to tobacco inside toner.
It's just the outside.

756
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:47,140
Oh,
okay.

757
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:49,330
But it's just like,
if you don't roll it fat enough,

758
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:51,040
um,
I see what you're saying.

759
00:30:51,041 --> 00:30:53,180
The tobacco leaf on the outside,
now you,

760
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:55,720
those Tibet.
What's really weird is those tobacco

761
00:30:55,721 --> 00:30:58,750
leafs are the debts,
the same leafs.

762
00:30:58,751 --> 00:31:01,030
It's on cigars,
but you don't inhale cigars,

763
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:04,480
but you inhale this so you get so fucked
up from these things.

764
00:31:04,481 --> 00:31:06,760
In a weird way,
it's a little bit of nicotine.

765
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:07,840
I mean,
I,

766
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:12,070
there's a lot it's battling.
It's like,

767
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:15,520
it's like stupidity and,
and,

768
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:17,770
and peace are battling together.

769
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:20,163
I,
um,

770
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:22,570
love weed.
Weed's my favorite.

771
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:25,510
I remember when I had to tell my mom
that your weed smoker.

772
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,460
Well,
she found weed in my,

773
00:31:27,461 --> 00:31:31,150
uh,
in my room and then she told me,

774
00:31:31,151 --> 00:31:32,510
she was like,
yeah.

775
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,180
She was like,
if I ever catch you smoking weed,

776
00:31:34,181 --> 00:31:35,620
she was like,
I'm going to beat the shit out of you.

777
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,320
But then the second I turned 18,
she was just like,

778
00:31:38,321 --> 00:31:41,380
and then it started to become legal.
She was like the first person to try to

779
00:31:41,381 --> 00:31:43,000
get a card.
Really?

780
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:44,110
Yeah.
My mom smokes tons,

781
00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:45,520
but my mom's a party areas.
Well,

782
00:31:45,521 --> 00:31:47,890
why was she worried about you?
Because she,

783
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,320
when she was young,
she did a lot of crazy stuff.

784
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:51,263
Oh,
she was,

785
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:53,020
she was going to ruin your life.
Yeah.

786
00:31:53,021 --> 00:31:54,020
She's doesn't want me to,
you know,

787
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:55,410
get crazy.
Well,

788
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,720
the people always resist the idea that
their children are going to become

789
00:31:58,721 --> 00:32:00,400
adults,
bothers them.

790
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:03,970
And it bothers them that their children
are going to face the same tests.

791
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:04,781
You know,
when your,

792
00:32:04,781 --> 00:32:06,160
when you become a parent you realize
like,

793
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:08,500
you think about all the stupid shit that
you barely survived.

794
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:09,940
Yeah.
Like God damn it.

795
00:32:09,941 --> 00:32:12,280
Like what about my kids?
They're going to have to make those same

796
00:32:12,281 --> 00:32:14,230
stupid mistakes and then,
you know,

797
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:16,510
people want a helicopter parent nerf the
world.

798
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,330
I'm good dude.
Yeah,

799
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:21,010
my Mama,
my mom loves me so much.

800
00:32:21,011 --> 00:32:21,930
She just,
she can't,

801
00:32:21,931 --> 00:32:22,511
I mean,
she's a mom.

802
00:32:22,511 --> 00:32:24,910
She care.
She had me when she was like 19,

803
00:32:24,911 --> 00:32:26,530
so when she was,
um,

804
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,470
she just doesn't want me to turn out to
be a beggar,

805
00:32:29,471 --> 00:32:31,410
which I mean,
I think I'm not going to be yachts.

806
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,740
Dude.
You're a man.

807
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:34,480
You're done Zack.
He made it through,

808
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:35,650
what is this?
Oh yeah.

809
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,690
Okay.
Play this because it's hilarious.

810
00:32:37,691 --> 00:32:40,290
This is the trump something.
Then the reporter

811
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:41,143
correcting them.

812
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:42,573
Listen to us.

813
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:47,550
Is it not going through?

814
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:49,623
Hmm.

815
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,730
We have a little bit of a sound here.
Costs,

816
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:59,900
bring it all the way back to the
beginning of [inaudible] six electoral

817
00:32:59,901 --> 00:33:03,530
college votes.
I guess it was the biggest electoral

818
00:33:03,531 --> 00:33:06,470
college wind since Ronald Reagan.

819
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,210
You said today that you had the biggest
electoral margin

820
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:17,820
votes for Obama got 365
330 when George Hw Bush 426 when he won

821
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:26,310
as presence.
So why should Americans cross?

822
00:33:26,311 --> 00:33:28,450
We'll no,
I was told I was given that information.

823
00:33:28,451 --> 00:33:29,430
I don't know.
I was just given,

824
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,760
we had a very,
very big margin.

825
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:34,990
Why should Americans across from you
when you accused the information they

826
00:33:34,991 --> 00:33:37,690
received from being vague when you're
providing information as well?

827
00:33:37,691 --> 00:33:39,190
I don't know.
I was giving you that information

828
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:40,880
I was getting,
I've actually,

829
00:33:40,881 --> 00:33:43,940
I've seen that information around,
but it was a very substantial victory.

830
00:33:43,941 --> 00:33:44,900
Do you agree with that?

831
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,890
Thank you.
That's good enough.

832
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:48,830
So yes,

833
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:50,880
this is craziness.
This is crazy.

834
00:33:50,881 --> 00:33:54,990
It's like you saw him adjust it mid
sentence where he was like,

835
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,690
ah,
I was talking about Republicans and then

836
00:33:57,691 --> 00:33:59,280
it turns out this guy hit him with a
bomb.

837
00:33:59,281 --> 00:34:02,220
It's almost like he verbal boxed him.
Like he set him up with that because he

838
00:34:02,221 --> 00:34:04,890
had Herbert Walker in his pocket.
He built up,

839
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:07,220
you know,
he went Obama and then he hits it.

840
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:09,210
He is Lord.
Why was I was talking about Republicans

841
00:34:09,211 --> 00:34:14,211
and then he held this George Herbert
Walker Bush boom,

842
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:15,930
which was like,
what is it for 55,

843
00:34:15,931 --> 00:34:17,280
he won by landslides.
Yeah.

844
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,920
Damn.
And then what did he do?

845
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:21,810
What trump did?
He just goes,

846
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,830
Eh,
yeah.

847
00:34:22,831 --> 00:34:24,420
It's just weird.
That's sort of the information I was

848
00:34:24,421 --> 00:34:27,180
given.
Like you want to know something funny?

849
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:29,940
When I did the roast battle,
um,

850
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:33,420
this is a great moment just for me as a
Hispanic man.

851
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:36,720
Um,
I told that Barron trump joke with,

852
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:39,270
I don't know that there was a joke.
I did and it was right after the lady

853
00:34:39,271 --> 00:34:40,920
got fired from snl.
Right.

854
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,390
And the joke I did was,
um,

855
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:44,610
and Dan Nolan was the one who wrote it
and he kept,

856
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:46,980
he pushed me so hard to do it and I was
like,

857
00:34:46,981 --> 00:34:47,731
I don't know if I can do it.
He's like,

858
00:34:47,731 --> 00:34:49,020
no man,
you have to do this one.

859
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:50,123
And it was like,
fine.

860
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:51,600
Um,
but he,

861
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:52,463
it was a,

862
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:57,240
and it could pass for a trump.
She's got the body of Millennia,

863
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:59,280
the brains of Ivanka and her womb is
barren.

864
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:00,520
Yeah.

865
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,040
Oh Shit.
Just a puts a play on words,

866
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:04,240
you know what I mean?
It's hilarious.

867
00:35:04,241 --> 00:35:06,520
So,
and it was just a good show mean eh,

868
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,790
she's not baron and his amazing woman.
Um,

869
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:13,060
but it was,
it was just so funny cause it was like

870
00:35:13,061 --> 00:35:16,900
the next day a conservative website
wrote an article about it and the

871
00:35:16,901 --> 00:35:20,050
article was about how good the joke was
because they were like,

872
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:24,250
this is how you don't write a joke or
this is swinging down against the

873
00:35:24,251 --> 00:35:27,100
president's son.
This is a great joke on plan where it's,

874
00:35:27,101 --> 00:35:30,550
and this can get you to win.
And it was just so funny to see people

875
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:31,500
look at that and be like,
oh,

876
00:35:31,501 --> 00:35:32,560
okay.
That's just a good joke.

877
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:36,550
It was really weird that intelligent
people thought it was okay to attack his

878
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:37,860
kid.
You should.

879
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:38,040
I

880
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,960
mean,
you should never just attack a person,

881
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:42,600
especially a kid who doesn't mean we
here.

882
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:44,580
It's weird that people make these,
I,

883
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:46,950
they just have these decisions.
They make like that.

884
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:49,890
Yeah.
It's okay because he's a kid of the

885
00:35:49,891 --> 00:35:51,030
enemy or something.
No,

886
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:53,100
it's just a little kid.
You got to hold yourself to a higher

887
00:35:53,101 --> 00:35:54,810
standard.
That's why I was like making that joke.

888
00:35:54,811 --> 00:35:57,690
I felt like it was,
it was a higher standard,

889
00:35:57,691 --> 00:36:00,750
but the good that you have that higher
standard because I think we all

890
00:36:00,751 --> 00:36:05,310
recognize that the base idea,
that base instinct to tax someone's kid

891
00:36:05,311 --> 00:36:06,144
like that.
Yeah.

892
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,100
The best part though was,
uh,

893
00:36:08,101 --> 00:36:09,780
after that,
uh,

894
00:36:09,781 --> 00:36:11,850
someone came up to me and they were just
like,

895
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,670
we don't want you to not make jokes.
We just want you,

896
00:36:14,671 --> 00:36:15,680
if you could please,
you know,

897
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:19,350
not mention Barron trump anymore,
that'd be great.

898
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,210
Yeah.
No,

899
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:21,950
it was like,
don't make a habit of it.

900
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:23,161
I was like,
no,

901
00:36:23,161 --> 00:36:24,030
I mean,
I'm not gonna,

902
00:36:24,031 --> 00:36:24,870
but I was like,
thanks.

903
00:36:24,871 --> 00:36:25,231
I was like,
oh,

904
00:36:25,231 --> 00:36:27,520
that's feels cool that they told me to
not do something.

905
00:36:27,521 --> 00:36:27,931
And I was like,
oh,

906
00:36:27,931 --> 00:36:29,610
that's great dude.
You're a rebel.

907
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:30,570
Yeah,
but it's,

908
00:36:30,571 --> 00:36:32,010
it's,
it's a really good joke.

909
00:36:32,011 --> 00:36:33,360
As you said,
it's a play on words.

910
00:36:33,361 --> 00:36:35,460
It's not mean at all.
It's not meet at all,

911
00:36:35,461 --> 00:36:37,890
nor is it really a joke about him.
It's just his name.

912
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:41,190
It's a great joke.
That's really pretty flawless joke when

913
00:36:41,191 --> 00:36:42,700
it comes to that subject,
you know?

914
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:48,270
Right on the line.
Some people would just say,

915
00:36:48,271 --> 00:36:50,910
you're crossed it,
but I think that they're wrong.

916
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:54,960
And I think that's a perfect point
because it's like you have to not make

917
00:36:54,961 --> 00:36:57,030
these jokes to fine line,
but it's like as Comedians,

918
00:36:57,031 --> 00:36:58,370
that's our job,
right?

919
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,960
We got it.
Not push the boundaries and like say

920
00:37:00,961 --> 00:37:03,660
terrible things,
but it's like you see a challenge,

921
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:06,120
you know?
See how finely you can walk that line

922
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,140
when you see a guy like trump going
through this,

923
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:13,460
whatever he's going through right now.
Do you think that that's just the,

924
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:17,510
this is just total speculation.
Do you think that's the weight of all

925
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:21,420
these people that are upset at him?
Do you think that's the magnitude of the

926
00:37:21,421 --> 00:37:23,200
job?
Do you think he,

927
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:27,330
this is just who he is.
I don't know if this is who he is.

928
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:29,520
Um,
I think he definitely,

929
00:37:29,521 --> 00:37:32,820
I think from what we can see is he
definitely stepped into a job he thought

930
00:37:32,821 --> 00:37:34,710
he could do.
And now he's just like,

931
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,461
oh,
okay.

932
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:37,980
Cause there's definitely some times
where you watch them and you see him try

933
00:37:37,981 --> 00:37:41,010
to run it like a business or the way he
talks to people.

934
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,000
Whereas just like,
oh,

935
00:37:42,001 --> 00:37:45,090
that's the way a boss would talk to
someone that he thinks is employed by

936
00:37:45,091 --> 00:37:46,170
him.
Yeah.

937
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:49,950
Oh boy.
I think he's also going through the

938
00:37:49,951 --> 00:37:52,260
scrutiny of some of the smartest people
in the world,

939
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:54,540
man.
And I don't think he ever has been

940
00:37:54,541 --> 00:37:56,880
through that.
And I think he's gone through the

941
00:37:56,881 --> 00:37:59,640
scrutiny of the general public in an
entertainment sense.

942
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:02,700
And then as sort of a,
you know,

943
00:38:02,701 --> 00:38:05,640
a cultural icon census is the term of
this billionaire,

944
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:10,290
flamboyant character puts his name on
all of these fabulous buildings and runs

945
00:38:10,291 --> 00:38:11,760
casinos and all that stuff.
I mean,

946
00:38:11,761 --> 00:38:14,040
that's how we thought of him.
He's like a bad ironman.

947
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:15,720
Well,
he's,

948
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,430
you know,
he's Donald Trump.

949
00:38:17,431 --> 00:38:18,264
I mean,
he's,

950
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:23,390
you don't get to be that successful
without some crazy drive to win.

951
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,640
And sometimes you know,
you,

952
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:30,680
you get this blinders sorta almost bull
headed determination forward and guys

953
00:38:32,521 --> 00:38:34,320
like that conquered worlds.

954
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:35,183
Yeah.
You know,

955
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,550
that's the real deal,
man.

956
00:38:36,551 --> 00:38:37,900
I mean,
that's really what it is.

957
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:41,470
That mindset that it's not always
correct,

958
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:44,800
but it's somehow or another almost
always prosperous.

959
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:46,480
Yes.
And they can get through,

960
00:38:46,481 --> 00:38:50,500
they can get through,
but I think the guy like that who's so

961
00:38:50,501 --> 00:38:53,290
business savvy and so it was good at
making money and some would argue,

962
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,640
maybe you're right,
maybe I'm wrong.

963
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:56,890
You know,
that he just invested his dad's money.

964
00:38:56,891 --> 00:38:59,200
I've heard all that,
but he still made a lot of fucking

965
00:38:59,201 --> 00:39:00,130
money.
Right.

966
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:01,930
Maybe,
you know,

967
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:04,670
who knows how much,
I don't know how much money you made and

968
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,640
he's gotten money that's for switches.
Fuck.

969
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:09,400
Yeah.
And I feel like all throughout history,

970
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:12,610
those guys that have done that have been
like conquerors.

971
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:13,750
Yeah.
This is just,

972
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:17,020
he's just getting to do it in business.
You know?

973
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:19,090
Now he's trying to do it on a global
scale,

974
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:24,240
but I think that that's almost like the
mindset of those like super billionaire.

975
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:26,410
I mean,
they have like conquerors genetics or

976
00:39:26,411 --> 00:39:27,390
something.
Oh yeah.

977
00:39:27,391 --> 00:39:29,320
You know what I mean?
He's got like a little bit of Alexander

978
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:32,380
and yeah,
but I think there's just humans like

979
00:39:32,381 --> 00:39:33,051
that.
Yeah.

980
00:39:33,051 --> 00:39:37,210
But now those humans find themselves in
business like these like super winner

981
00:39:37,211 --> 00:39:39,010
characters,
you know,

982
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,410
fuck what you care about.
Fuck what you think.

983
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,300
You know this,
we're going to do it my way.

984
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:46,990
You know?
Sometimes I feel like I have that drive

985
00:39:46,991 --> 00:39:47,830
to,
you know what I mean?

986
00:39:47,831 --> 00:39:49,540
Where it's like now,
especially where it's like,

987
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:50,680
I,
I get that.

988
00:39:50,681 --> 00:39:52,120
You know what I mean?
Like that driver,

989
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,160
it's like,
fuck it and let's just work hard and get

990
00:39:54,161 --> 00:39:55,390
the shit done.
Yeah.

991
00:39:55,391 --> 00:39:57,220
Well,
I don't know if that's what he's got.

992
00:39:57,490 --> 00:39:58,930
I mean,
it definitely think he's got some of

993
00:39:58,931 --> 00:39:59,710
that.
Yeah.

994
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:02,590
I mean it's definitely misplaced in a
nod direction.

995
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,070
Well,
it's just under the scrutiny of all of

996
00:40:05,071 --> 00:40:08,080
these insanely intelligent people now.
It's just really,

997
00:40:08,081 --> 00:40:10,570
really fascinating.
Like that reporter like that,

998
00:40:10,571 --> 00:40:13,240
that kind of interaction is a new thing
to him.

999
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:14,350
Oh yeah.
It's the,

1000
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:16,440
just the way he communicates.
It's,

1001
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:19,510
I don't think he's ever been in a
situation where I think he's always been

1002
00:40:19,511 --> 00:40:21,520
in a situation where he definitely feels
and thinks,

1003
00:40:21,521 --> 00:40:24,040
he's like,
I'm definitely the smartest person in

1004
00:40:24,041 --> 00:40:27,160
the room right now.
But like when you put up up against

1005
00:40:27,161 --> 00:40:27,994
someone that are,
you know,

1006
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,780
more intelligent and like also have
their shit ready in their facts,

1007
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,900
he,
he doesn't know how to like handle that

1008
00:40:34,901 --> 00:40:37,660
and then he just like breaks down in a
sense what you just saw,

1009
00:40:37,661 --> 00:40:39,970
you know,
he like change his words and he like,

1010
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:42,220
uh,
it's really interesting from a

1011
00:40:42,221 --> 00:40:43,810
psychological perspective,
you know,

1012
00:40:43,811 --> 00:40:48,811
Howard stern had a really fascinating
take on it and his take on it was that

1013
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:52,840
trump really wants to be loved and
that's a bad job for him because of

1014
00:40:52,841 --> 00:40:53,290
that.

1015
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:54,830
Oh yeah.
Because there's a precedent.

1016
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:58,930
There's no president that's ever been
universally loved,

1017
00:40:58,931 --> 00:40:59,850
I feel,
you know what I mean?

1018
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:03,470
I have way more like,
either people love you or people hate

1019
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:04,690
you.
Yeah.

1020
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,520
It's one of the other,
it doesn't say,

1021
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:09,210
it's never like,
oh I can live with them.

1022
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:10,210
Yeah.
You know,

1023
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,250
like some people were like,
I could live with them.

1024
00:41:12,251 --> 00:41:16,360
With George W after nine 11 his approval
rating went through the roof.

1025
00:41:16,361 --> 00:41:17,021
I remember that.
Yeah,

1026
00:41:17,021 --> 00:41:19,960
I do because he made us feel better.
He did,

1027
00:41:19,961 --> 00:41:20,950
you know,
like we said,

1028
00:41:20,951 --> 00:41:23,800
okay,
well when some shit goes down this is

1029
00:41:23,801 --> 00:41:27,670
the kind of guy you want there.
Some guy who gives a real good speech

1030
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:31,590
right afterwards has this strong
military backing and going,

1031
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,320
okay,
this is what we need right now.

1032
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:34,370
Yeah.
And

1033
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,940
a lot of ways you know that that was
what you need after some sort of a,

1034
00:41:38,941 --> 00:41:43,700
a global crisis like that you need some
and a leader.

1035
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:46,130
Yeah.
So that was probably like the one time

1036
00:41:46,131 --> 00:41:48,980
that I can remember just,
and it wasn't that long before people

1037
00:41:48,981 --> 00:41:50,770
giving up on him again,
you know,

1038
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:54,170
after mission accomplished maybe.
I heard that that was like the beginning

1039
00:41:54,171 --> 00:41:55,580
of the end.
Once they did that,

1040
00:41:55,581 --> 00:42:00,581
they had that they had a warship with a
giant mission accomplished banner in the

1041
00:42:00,711 --> 00:42:02,930
background and the war is,
you know,

1042
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:04,700
goes on for another like seven years.
Right.

1043
00:42:04,701 --> 00:42:09,701
So why did the war end there?
How much later after that mission

1044
00:42:10,221 --> 00:42:12,500
accomplished at the war actually end my
favorite.

1045
00:42:12,501 --> 00:42:12,600
Yeah.

1046
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:15,090
There was a dude whose job it was to go
get that printed up.

1047
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:17,190
Oh my God.
He probably would just staring at it

1048
00:42:17,191 --> 00:42:17,950
like

1049
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:20,520
so insanely.
Someone talked to him and they said,

1050
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:21,570
sir,
it's over.

1051
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:22,590
Yeah.
Beautiful.

1052
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:24,360
Perfect.
Put up the flag.

1053
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,280
Let's do this.
Put up the banner.

1054
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,800
Yeah,
look at that mission accomplished.

1055
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:32,370
Dad.
Seems like a scene in a movie,

1056
00:42:32,371 --> 00:42:34,650
doesn't it?
And when you look at that photo,

1057
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:36,870
it's like,
is that real?

1058
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:40,410
Is that really what happened?
Folks?

1059
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:44,220
As you get older and you see this thing
going on,

1060
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:48,360
you see these people and you see the
presidents and you see the White House

1061
00:42:48,361 --> 00:42:50,790
and Congress and you realize after
Awhile,

1062
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:53,100
oh,
these are all just people.

1063
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:54,720
Yeah.
These are all just people,

1064
00:42:54,721 --> 00:42:58,500
human beings,
and they are entrapped in this system

1065
00:42:58,501 --> 00:43:03,210
that they've constructed.
In order to dictate where they go,

1066
00:43:03,211 --> 00:43:07,170
when they go,
how much they get and how they can live.

1067
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:10,610
I mean that's really what it is,
is a series of laws that the,

1068
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:11,200
the,
the,

1069
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,590
the Jack,
the general idea is they're there to

1070
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:17,310
protect you and your interest,
but in a lot of ways,

1071
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:18,130
not really.
No,

1072
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:19,920
we don't trust it.
It's just a system.

1073
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:20,710
Yeah.
Oh,

1074
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:23,250
system of control that we all agree to.
Yeah.

1075
00:43:23,251 --> 00:43:24,570
Man.
You know,

1076
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,580
I think that it's so funny cause it's
like the more stuff that happens with

1077
00:43:27,581 --> 00:43:29,980
him and then just seeing everything,
the more and more,

1078
00:43:29,981 --> 00:43:31,210
I'm just like,
this isn't real.

1079
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:33,010
This is all just,
this has to be a joke.

1080
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:34,810
Yeah.
It feels,

1081
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:38,080
it doesn't feel real,
but it never did.

1082
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,570
It feels less and less real.
What time though?

1083
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:43,250
It does you,
I mean you always make this joke where

1084
00:43:43,251 --> 00:43:45,760
we're like,
we're in a simulation and there's many a

1085
00:43:45,761 --> 00:43:48,880
day where I'll just specially going on
the road with you just being here just

1086
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:49,990
anywhere.
I'm just like,

1087
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:51,730
Oh,
if this was a simulation,

1088
00:43:51,731 --> 00:43:53,860
this is definitely the simulation I'd be
playing.

1089
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:56,870
Yeah.
It seems like this is a fun one to play.

1090
00:43:57,590 --> 00:43:59,890
It seems like there's a lot of game
elements in it.

1091
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:02,760
It seems like there's good decisions,
bad decisions,

1092
00:44:02,761 --> 00:44:05,480
and the repercussions for each.
It's insane.

1093
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:08,480
Yeah.
It's a weird,

1094
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:13,660
weird world that you live in.
When a popular person wins the

1095
00:44:14,031 --> 00:44:18,360
popularity contest for the first time,
know like someone who decides that they,

1096
00:44:18,361 --> 00:44:23,150
they're going to run things like there's
never been a guy like trump who's run a

1097
00:44:23,151 --> 00:44:26,690
country like that and we just became
like a really popular person and then

1098
00:44:26,691 --> 00:44:29,570
just took over the country.
Fascinating.

1099
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:31,100
Absolutely insane.
My favorite,

1100
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,280
just the people that fall

1101
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:33,360
that's like,
I can't,

1102
00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:36,300
I love just watching them and talking to
them.

1103
00:44:36,350 --> 00:44:38,250
Some people are happy that there's
chaos,

1104
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:40,890
no mistake about that.
There's some people that are happy that

1105
00:44:40,891 --> 00:44:44,070
he's in there because they think that
the system that was in place was

1106
00:44:44,071 --> 00:44:45,750
insanely corrupt and I think they're
right.

1107
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:50,130
They're banking on him being the
solution to that,

1108
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,470
you know?
Because of his business savvy.

1109
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:57,180
I don't understand politics or finances
enough to know if they're right.

1110
00:44:57,570 --> 00:44:58,350
I don't.
Yeah,

1111
00:44:58,350 --> 00:45:01,020
but I know that like culturally it's
weird.

1112
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:02,790
The whole thing is weird.
I feel like,

1113
00:45:02,791 --> 00:45:04,470
you know the difference between right
and wrong.

1114
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:06,210
Yeah.
I would hope so.

1115
00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:08,243
I,
you know,

1116
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:10,030
it's not even,
it's not necessary.

1117
00:45:10,031 --> 00:45:12,270
I think it's an impossible job.
Oh yeah.

1118
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:13,390
I really do.
I think it's,

1119
00:45:13,391 --> 00:45:15,030
it's,
I think we should phase it out.

1120
00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:18,540
I think we should figure out how to get
a large group of people,

1121
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:19,350
you know?

1122
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:24,210
And I think
you can go as many as like a dozen and

1123
00:45:24,211 --> 00:45:27,540
have these people work it out like
really smart people.

1124
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:29,730
Yeah.
All scientists now.

1125
00:45:29,731 --> 00:45:31,110
Different,
different disciplines.

1126
00:45:31,111 --> 00:45:34,260
I think you'd have to have people from
the medical profession who'd have to

1127
00:45:34,261 --> 00:45:36,390
have people from the scientific
communities,

1128
00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:38,290
biology,
um,

1129
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:40,530
astrophysics.
You'd have to have people that are

1130
00:45:40,531 --> 00:45:43,230
predicting like what's going on with
asteroids.

1131
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:45,200
We cool.
Is Everything cool or should we just,

1132
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,730
should we just fuck it,
do whatever we want?

1133
00:45:47,731 --> 00:45:51,840
Because we're going to get hit by a
giant rock 40 miles wide,

1134
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:53,160
you know,
in 10 years.

1135
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,600
So we just chill.
I do,

1136
00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:57,300
yeah.
I need people smarter than me to fucking

1137
00:45:57,310 --> 00:45:58,230
decide stuff.
Like that.

1138
00:45:58,250 --> 00:45:59,180
Cause it's one of the things where it's
like,

1139
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:03,390
like I'm an idiot,
but I'm also pretty kind of well versed

1140
00:46:03,391 --> 00:46:05,040
on a lot of things.
Yeah.

1141
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:08,250
But I mean I don't know anything about
finances.

1142
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:10,740
I mean I like to think I know a little
bit about politics,

1143
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:13,980
but I mean if there's a group of
scientists and people that are really,

1144
00:46:13,981 --> 00:46:14,790
you know,
design,

1145
00:46:14,790 --> 00:46:17,070
I'd much rather have that.
And then one dude,

1146
00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:19,470
he's not a big fan of a certain round
people.

1147
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:20,670
Yeah.
I'm,

1148
00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:23,850
I'm exactly like that.
I don't know shit about politics,

1149
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:27,480
but I do know and I talk about it and
people,

1150
00:46:27,481 --> 00:46:29,030
we shouldn't talk about swim.
You don't shoot.

1151
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:31,620
I'm not,
I'm not even going to study that crazy

1152
00:46:31,621 --> 00:46:33,600
system.
I think it's ridiculous.

1153
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:36,570
I think you can kiss my ass.
People allowed to give you money and

1154
00:46:36,571 --> 00:46:40,860
then you do things that they want you to
do that donate money to you and then you

1155
00:46:40,861 --> 00:46:43,530
make decisions that benefit them and
what we're for real.

1156
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:46,470
Yeah.
I don't need to be smart to know that.

1157
00:46:46,471 --> 00:46:48,270
That seems a little bit fucking weird.

1158
00:46:48,290 --> 00:46:50,100
That systems crazy.
It's just old as fuck.

1159
00:46:50,101 --> 00:46:52,410
And that's how they had to do it in the
17 hundreds okay,

1160
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,750
thanks.
It's 2017 we could come up with a better

1161
00:46:54,751 --> 00:46:55,500
system.
This,

1162
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:56,970
yeah.
Across the board.

1163
00:46:57,690 --> 00:47:00,420
You know,
like everyone's tripping about the

1164
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:03,900
immigration,
which they're deporting illegals and

1165
00:47:03,901 --> 00:47:05,520
stuff.
They really are,

1166
00:47:05,521 --> 00:47:06,181
Huh?
Yeah.

1167
00:47:06,181 --> 00:47:09,350
That's so is it more than they used to
deport people cause how much of the used

1168
00:47:09,351 --> 00:47:11,580
to deport you still deporting regular
amounts of people.

1169
00:47:11,581 --> 00:47:12,990
From what I understand from what I've
looked at,

1170
00:47:12,991 --> 00:47:16,560
but the thing that I'm worried about and
that worries me is that it's like

1171
00:47:17,370 --> 00:47:22,110
there's certain people that obviously
are illegal here and are getting sent

1172
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:23,370
back.
Not all of them,

1173
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:26,310
but just the fact that there's some that
are getting sent back that are American

1174
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:28,470
concerns me.
Yeah.

1175
00:47:28,590 --> 00:47:30,310
And there's that are really cool as
fuck.

1176
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:32,440
Cause I mean I haven't really nice,
beautiful,

1177
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:33,910
real fucking cool as fuck.
Yeah.

1178
00:47:33,911 --> 00:47:35,680
There's,
there's a lot of really nice people.

1179
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:37,440
Yeah.
I make this joke now where it's like I,

1180
00:47:37,441 --> 00:47:42,130
I joke about losing my id and how that's
going to be a big problem for me now.

1181
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:45,160
It's like if I get stopped and then I
have to convince this dude that I'm

1182
00:47:45,161 --> 00:47:46,300
American,
you know what I mean?

1183
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:48,970
A lot of people that hear me say that
jug or like,

1184
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:49,840
oh,
that's not real.

1185
00:47:49,841 --> 00:47:51,200
That's steel.
Well that's dumb fear.

1186
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:53,020
It's like you can just talk to them and
it's like,

1187
00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:54,670
yeah,
maybe,

1188
00:47:54,970 --> 00:47:58,480
but what if that guy's having a fucking
bad day and also don't you think like

1189
00:47:58,481 --> 00:48:01,480
every other Mexican that gets cotton
that is going to be trying to give the

1190
00:48:01,481 --> 00:48:04,990
exact same speech.
I am 100% man.

1191
00:48:05,150 --> 00:48:07,240
It's just,
it's weird because they're really only

1192
00:48:07,241 --> 00:48:11,470
targeting Mexicans around California.
You're not going to deport Canadians.

1193
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:15,390
Hot Blonde,
pan's hot blonde girl from Vancouver and

1194
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:16,700
sent her home.
Yeah,

1195
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,220
the fuck out of here.
Exactly.

1196
00:48:18,221 --> 00:48:19,530
Targeting Mexicans.
Right.

1197
00:48:19,550 --> 00:48:21,820
I would assume white people going crazy
right now.

1198
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:29,720
It is my favorite limousine liberal.

1199
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,690
My favorite too is that it's like,
you know,

1200
00:48:31,691 --> 00:48:34,390
I talk about these things and stuff in a
very joking manner,

1201
00:48:34,391 --> 00:48:36,100
but these are real problems certain
people are having.

1202
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:40,190
And I went to a small show and it was in
a house and it was just a lot of like

1203
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:42,040
white checks,
white guys,

1204
00:48:42,041 --> 00:48:43,360
which is fine.
You know what I mean?

1205
00:48:43,570 --> 00:48:46,450
But I could just see some of them start
to get uncomfortable with the things I

1206
00:48:46,451 --> 00:48:47,290
was saying,
but it's like,

1207
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:48,280
you know what?
That's fine.

1208
00:48:48,690 --> 00:48:51,010
A wall.
A wall.

1209
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:55,420
I just feel like one day that's not
going to be real.

1210
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:56,321
The Wall.
No,

1211
00:48:56,321 --> 00:48:57,340
I don't think the wall is going to be
real.

1212
00:48:57,460 --> 00:48:59,300
No,
I don't think that.

1213
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:02,330
I don't think there's going to be,
I don't think this is a great idea.

1214
00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:04,480
Like a new world order.
Yeah.

1215
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:05,930
You know,
like idea,

1216
00:49:05,931 --> 00:49:08,110
like one government to rule the world.
Yeah.

1217
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:12,080
But I think it would be really nice if
people could go wherever the fuck they

1218
00:49:12,081 --> 00:49:15,050
want.
I just feel like this idea that you can

1219
00:49:15,051 --> 00:49:18,410
like legally restrict people's movement
based on patches of dearth they were

1220
00:49:18,411 --> 00:49:22,910
shit out onto is pretty ridiculous.
It just seems like that's going to go

1221
00:49:22,911 --> 00:49:25,610
away.
And if it doesn't go away a hundred

1222
00:49:25,610 --> 00:49:26,720
years from now,
it's going to go away a thousand years

1223
00:49:26,721 --> 00:49:28,370
from now.
It's preposterous.

1224
00:49:28,371 --> 00:49:28,550
It's like

1225
00:49:28,550 --> 00:49:29,211
what's the point?
People,

1226
00:49:29,211 --> 00:49:30,710
I mean,
whenever I talk to people what the

1227
00:49:30,711 --> 00:49:32,120
immigration thing,
people always,

1228
00:49:32,121 --> 00:49:33,980
uh,
and I respect people's opinions.

1229
00:49:33,981 --> 00:49:38,150
I'll listen and I'm willing to learn and
like I'll listen where you'd have to say

1230
00:49:38,151 --> 00:49:40,160
and if it's terrible,
I'll probably make fun of you a little

1231
00:49:40,161 --> 00:49:42,080
bit.
That's just how I deal with things.

1232
00:49:42,110 --> 00:49:45,560
Um,
but it's like California used to be a

1233
00:49:45,561 --> 00:49:47,440
part of Mexico.
Yeah.

1234
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:49,280
If you look at the history,
but we buy it.

1235
00:49:49,490 --> 00:49:52,610
No,
it should say we throw myself into white

1236
00:49:52,611 --> 00:49:54,320
people even though my parents were all
immigrants.

1237
00:49:54,630 --> 00:49:56,740
We're all immigrants.
The colonocytes.

1238
00:49:56,750 --> 00:49:57,740
Yeah.
But it was,

1239
00:49:57,741 --> 00:49:59,720
um,
I mean that's why I need though people

1240
00:49:59,721 --> 00:50:00,890
do do that.
Like I said,

1241
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:01,700
you know,
we,

1242
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:02,640
I would say we,
okay,

1243
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:06,890
well we killed all the Indians now and
have a bitch did zero direct connection

1244
00:50:06,891 --> 00:50:09,980
to me and ending Indian deaths.
But you know,

1245
00:50:09,981 --> 00:50:11,420
they'll say,
we did it.

1246
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:12,650
You know,
when we came here,

1247
00:50:12,651 --> 00:50:14,240
we pushed out the native Americans,
so wait,

1248
00:50:14,270 --> 00:50:17,000
what is this?
And it's funny that they say pushed out,

1249
00:50:17,030 --> 00:50:17,781
you know what I mean?
It's like,

1250
00:50:17,781 --> 00:50:20,960
no,
it was pushed out in a very nice term.

1251
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:23,840
So what we did to them,
I said,

1252
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:25,130
tell,
yeah,

1253
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:28,340
it's,
but it's that we thing it's supernatural

1254
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:30,260
do.
It's super easy to get locked up into

1255
00:50:30,261 --> 00:50:31,760
little tribes.
We just got to give it up.

1256
00:50:31,970 --> 00:50:33,080
Yeah.
We got to give it up.

1257
00:50:33,081 --> 00:50:35,300
It's stupid.
It is old and dumb.

1258
00:50:35,330 --> 00:50:37,460
It's so dumb.
It's fine for teams.

1259
00:50:37,490 --> 00:50:38,840
Yes.
You want to play sports.

1260
00:50:38,841 --> 00:50:40,650
It's awesome.
Cleveland's going to tell you going to

1261
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:42,350
the loo,
going to fork and go to a

1262
00:50:42,351 --> 00:50:45,260
representative.
We need a big asteroid that's fucking

1263
00:50:45,261 --> 00:50:47,810
unify everybody.
It would do that.

1264
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:51,020
It definitely would.
I saw what nine 11 did to New Yorkers.

1265
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:54,740
I guarantee you if we had some sort of a
mega disaster,

1266
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:58,940
the people that survive who'd be nicer
to each other and they would realize how

1267
00:50:58,941 --> 00:51:00,260
fortunate we are.
We've just,

1268
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:03,770
we've been in a time of peace for so
long that we,

1269
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:08,600
we can't intellectualize like we can't
like in a conscious sense,

1270
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:14,230
wrap our head around the fact that at
any moment there could be a 45,000 mile

1271
00:51:15,861 --> 00:51:19,640
an hour chunk of rock that slams into
us.

1272
00:51:19,670 --> 00:51:21,470
Yeah.
Well it can happen at any time.

1273
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:23,120
We all think we're invincible.
Dude.

1274
00:51:23,121 --> 00:51:28,121
Those are scary.
Like there's supposed to be like 900,000

1275
00:51:28,341 --> 00:51:31,190
near Earth objects between us and and
Jupiter.

1276
00:51:31,370 --> 00:51:32,720
Oh yeah.
It's crazy,

1277
00:51:32,810 --> 00:51:33,680
isn't it?
Is that right?

1278
00:51:35,090 --> 00:51:36,740
Did you see?
There's a hope.

1279
00:51:36,741 --> 00:51:40,050
I'm wrong about that,
but it's something scary like that at

1280
00:51:40,051 --> 00:51:45,051
some insane number.
Tyson put up a diagram of the earth and

1281
00:51:45,951 --> 00:51:47,290
just the soldiers.
Tyson,

1282
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:49,770
I think you should be real clear.
I mean,

1283
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:50,990
that's the only Tyson I know.
Nah,

1284
00:51:50,991 --> 00:51:53,060
I'm just kidding.
Just start coding.

1285
00:51:53,061 --> 00:51:53,600
I'm sorry.
What did,

1286
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:55,310
what did he put up?
He posted,

1287
00:51:55,311 --> 00:51:58,460
it was on his instagram.
It was just a diagram of the solar

1288
00:51:58,461 --> 00:52:00,710
system like rotating,
but then it showed like,

1289
00:52:01,010 --> 00:52:04,940
cause we're technically flying through
the universe and then it shows just like

1290
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:09,950
it's just a group of us just all and the
moment that I realized that we're not

1291
00:52:09,951 --> 00:52:13,220
stationary and that we're actually just
moving through the universe,

1292
00:52:13,450 --> 00:52:14,480
my had fucking exploded.

1293
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:15,770
Oh,
it's crazy.

1294
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:16,501
Yeah,
that,

1295
00:52:16,501 --> 00:52:21,050
that graphic is beautiful.
It's you realize like it's taking a long

1296
00:52:21,051 --> 00:52:24,590
time for it to make that motion.
You're looking at over millions and

1297
00:52:24,590 --> 00:52:26,570
billions of years,
but that is what it's doing.

1298
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:29,030
Yeah.
This is,

1299
00:52:29,090 --> 00:52:34,090
our world is spinning around a giant
nuclear explosion that's hurling towards

1300
00:52:36,651 --> 00:52:39,320
something.
What it looks like is if someone

1301
00:52:39,321 --> 00:52:44,321
launched some sort of a nuclear bullet
and we're looking at it in slow motion.

1302
00:52:45,470 --> 00:52:48,980
It's crazy.
Like have a gun launched a son bullet.

1303
00:52:49,550 --> 00:52:54,550
I mean that's what we're looking at.
It's just our version of time is so,

1304
00:52:55,450 --> 00:53:00,450
so brief that we can't appreciate that
this thing is in motion because it's

1305
00:53:02,031 --> 00:53:05,900
motion requires billions of years to
complete.

1306
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:10,190
So it's literally like a,
a bullet getting shot through the Canon

1307
00:53:10,191 --> 00:53:15,191
and all those things around it are
particles that are sort of connected to

1308
00:53:15,291 --> 00:53:17,720
it,
like little fragments of it as it hurls

1309
00:53:17,721 --> 00:53:19,700
through infinity.
We're just,

1310
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:22,280
we're just a speck in the history.
As I said,

1311
00:53:22,290 --> 00:53:24,680
I remember I was in class and they did.
It was like in the,

1312
00:53:24,681 --> 00:53:25,980
in time of

1313
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:28,350
history or in the time it was in the
time of the universe.

1314
00:53:28,630 --> 00:53:31,440
Humanity is just a second.
Yeah.

1315
00:53:31,441 --> 00:53:32,790
It's not even that.
It's nothing.

1316
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:35,090
It's nothing.
We're just a little tiny thing.

1317
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:38,340
How many more near Earth objects?
Okay.

1318
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:44,160
15,629 near Earth objects have been
discovered.

1319
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:49,220
Some 876 of those are asteroids with a
diameter of approximately one kilometer.

1320
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:53,850
Oh or larger.
1700 God,

1321
00:53:53,851 --> 00:53:55,530
potentially hazardous.

1322
00:53:55,630 --> 00:54:00,630
1,785 of these near Earth objects have
been classified as potentially hazardous

1323
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:06,790
asteroids or p h a s Jesus Christ.
You know,

1324
00:54:06,791 --> 00:54:08,920
when they have just three letters,
it's serious.

1325
00:54:09,850 --> 00:54:14,050
They broke it down.
Potentially hazardous asteroids.

1326
00:54:14,051 --> 00:54:16,810
1,780

1327
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:19,660
I was thinking of last just last night.
I think I was talking to my friend.

1328
00:54:19,661 --> 00:54:22,810
What if one doesn't hit earth but
crashes into the moon and just fine?

1329
00:54:23,290 --> 00:54:26,410
Oh,
no bad.

1330
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:29,880
It's all bad.
There's still people who think of the

1331
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:31,720
moon's a hologram.
It's definitely not real.

1332
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:37,720
There was one that slammed into Jupiter
that the explosion it created.

1333
00:54:37,721 --> 00:54:39,460
It was so big.
It was,

1334
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:42,700
I believe it was like almost the size of
the earth itself.

1335
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:44,530
Oh my God.
That's crazy.

1336
00:54:44,590 --> 00:54:45,341
Yeah.
Well,

1337
00:54:45,341 --> 00:54:50,341
Jupiter apparently is the reason why we
are alive because Jupiter is so massive

1338
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,950
that it draws everything.
It's like our protector.

1339
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:55,590
It's like our guard dog.
Hmm.

1340
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:58,360
Look at this.
Look at the fucking impact.

1341
00:54:58,361 --> 00:55:00,820
Watch this impact it is the craziest
shit.

1342
00:55:01,330 --> 00:55:02,680
Look at that.
Boom.

1343
00:55:02,710 --> 00:55:04,750
That's an asteroid will impact on
Jupiter.

1344
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:08,440
It was the size of the earth.
It was the size of birth.

1345
00:55:08,470 --> 00:55:10,180
Yeah.
What the fuck man?

1346
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:13,630
Why in the fuck?
The size of the whole earth

1347
00:55:15,650 --> 00:55:18,310
and the size of everything on this
planet.

1348
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:22,240
Get the fuck out of here.
That's so insane.

1349
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:25,420
That's one of those moments that you
can't even like if that happened here on

1350
00:55:25,421 --> 00:55:26,500
earth,
he couldn't run from it.

1351
00:55:26,501 --> 00:55:28,180
That's just one of those moms where you
look at it and you're like,

1352
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:30,130
this is going to happen.

1353
00:55:30,130 --> 00:55:30,581
Well,
you know,

1354
00:55:30,581 --> 00:55:34,120
that's what they say earth is that earth
is earth too,

1355
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:38,500
and that there was an earth one and
earth one got hit by another planet and

1356
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:39,960
that's what created the moon.
Yeah.

1357
00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:43,300
That's like,
I think that's the most current theory

1358
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:47,440
of how the the earth and the moon were
formed to weather so close to each

1359
00:55:47,441 --> 00:55:48,040
other.

1360
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:50,170
Yeah.
There's a great diagram of an asteroid

1361
00:55:50,171 --> 00:55:53,200
hitting the earth.
One is what they described as exempt and

1362
00:55:53,201 --> 00:55:57,150
then it just shows like how it would
spin off and just a piece of it just,

1363
00:55:57,190 --> 00:56:00,460
and so there's a good diagram of how
that's a pretty great theory.

1364
00:56:00,910 --> 00:56:04,090
Now Does the moon the,
it's interesting that the moon doesn't

1365
00:56:04,091 --> 00:56:05,680
spin the way the earth spins,
right?

1366
00:56:05,681 --> 00:56:08,860
It has a different spin.
It spins around us,

1367
00:56:08,861 --> 00:56:10,960
but it does it spin on its axis as well.

1368
00:56:12,390 --> 00:56:13,223
Yeah.

1369
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:15,700
Is that a stupid question?
Probably.

1370
00:56:15,701 --> 00:56:16,534
Right.

1371
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:22,250
I just don't understand gravity,
so I should probably shut the fuck up.

1372
00:56:23,590 --> 00:56:27,430
The mood orbits Earth every once every
27.3 to two days.

1373
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:31,810
It takes probably approximately 27 days.
So the moon moon to rotate on its axis

1374
00:56:31,811 --> 00:56:34,060
as a result of moon does not seem to be
spinning,

1375
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:38,620
but appears to observe us from the earth
to be almost perfectly still.

1376
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:41,710
Scientists call this synchronous
rotation.

1377
00:56:41,770 --> 00:56:43,330
Ah,
fascinating.

1378
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:45,460
Wow,
that's fucking cool.

1379
00:56:45,490 --> 00:56:48,460
Oh,
so we're both spinning up,

1380
00:56:48,470 --> 00:56:52,540
dude.
It's just the way we spin and the way

1381
00:56:52,541 --> 00:56:55,420
it's bins appears to us that it's not
spinning.

1382
00:56:55,940 --> 00:57:00,250
It's amazing through the moon is up
fucking crazy thing.

1383
00:57:00,251 --> 00:57:02,260
There's something one quarter the size
of us,

1384
00:57:02,261 --> 00:57:05,200
it's dead as fuck and it's just floating
in the sky.

1385
00:57:05,470 --> 00:57:08,770
It's like having a dead body next to
your house that you never talk about,

1386
00:57:08,890 --> 00:57:11,920
but you just look at it can't die.
He's look at it on your way to school.

1387
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:15,760
There's some dude who's got a skeleton
out of bench and just sitting there.

1388
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:19,900
That's what we could be.
We could easily be that stupid fucking

1389
00:57:19,901 --> 00:57:22,930
moon floating in the universe would not
give a shit.

1390
00:57:22,931 --> 00:57:25,780
Now yours doesn't care.
The universe does not give a fuck if

1391
00:57:25,781 --> 00:57:27,730
there's water in Arizona.
He doesn't care.

1392
00:57:28,030 --> 00:57:30,310
My favorite,
just seeing the moon during the day and

1393
00:57:30,311 --> 00:57:31,180
you're just like,
oh wow,

1394
00:57:31,210 --> 00:57:33,730
that's trippy,
but really fucking cool.

1395
00:57:33,790 --> 00:57:36,070
It is so important how people smarter
than us out there.

1396
00:57:36,071 --> 00:57:39,220
So we could find this out.
Imagine if you and I had to figure out

1397
00:57:39,221 --> 00:57:40,480
what was going on.
Oh,

1398
00:57:40,510 --> 00:57:42,910
we'd be fucking dumb.
We'd be done.

1399
00:57:43,930 --> 00:57:46,960
We'd just be making fun of stuff here.
They're showing how it works here.

1400
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:54,420
How has his own spins.
Every part of it is essentially the same

1401
00:57:56,501 --> 00:57:57,334
part.

1402
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:01,760
That's kind of fascinating.
So the way the earth spins,

1403
00:58:01,761 --> 00:58:05,770
the way the moon spins it,
it rotates at such a synchronous order.

1404
00:58:05,830 --> 00:58:07,640
It looks like it's not spinning.
That's beautiful.

1405
00:58:08,510 --> 00:58:09,920
See,
science is just such a fucking

1406
00:58:09,921 --> 00:58:13,340
incredible thing that someone could
figure that out and they can tell you

1407
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:15,230
and then you don't have to figure it out
on your own.

1408
00:58:15,380 --> 00:58:16,580
Not like,
cause that's dish.

1409
00:58:16,581 --> 00:58:17,900
Too much work involved.
Oh,

1410
00:58:17,901 --> 00:58:19,490
imagine if you had to figure out,
you know,

1411
00:58:19,491 --> 00:58:21,080
what is nuclear physics,
you know,

1412
00:58:21,081 --> 00:58:21,914
what is,
um,

1413
00:58:22,190 --> 00:58:24,440
what's an atom?
What's it on your own?

1414
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:26,330
No,
it's the weirdest thing about people is

1415
00:58:26,331 --> 00:58:28,970
that we all act collectively whether we
know it or not.

1416
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:31,910
We all act collectively.
And without that,

1417
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:33,310
I feel like I have a booger on my nose
door.

1418
00:58:33,370 --> 00:58:35,960
Now you get,
why is that so embarrassing?

1419
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:38,450
Because everybody has boogers,
right?

1420
00:58:38,540 --> 00:58:40,220
If you'd have a booger,
something's probably wrong with your

1421
00:58:40,221 --> 00:58:42,590
nose,
but to have one to talk about it goes

1422
00:58:42,591 --> 00:58:43,640
back to like childhood.

1423
00:58:45,290 --> 00:58:45,981
Yeah.
Like,

1424
00:58:45,981 --> 00:58:47,450
you know,
you catch a kid's picking their nose.

1425
00:58:47,451 --> 00:58:48,440
Hey,
get out of there.

1426
00:58:48,530 --> 00:58:51,230
Stop digging in there.
It's just that good feeling.

1427
00:58:51,710 --> 00:58:54,440
It's very embarrassing.
Good feeling of picking out a bugger.

1428
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:55,760
Ah,
it's so satisfying,

1429
00:58:56,060 --> 00:58:57,980
dude.
Ever watched someone do it in traffic?

1430
00:58:58,790 --> 00:59:01,280
I have.
Fast forward was looking.

1431
00:59:01,310 --> 00:59:03,800
You're just going at it.
I had my nose fixed.

1432
00:59:03,950 --> 00:59:06,620
They had a deviated septum.
And uh,

1433
00:59:06,621 --> 00:59:07,520
after I,
uh,

1434
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:12,110
after I had my nose fixed,
I was blowing out the most disgusting

1435
00:59:12,410 --> 00:59:17,060
blood book because it was all like scabs
and Khaled.

1436
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:20,900
And I would blow it out and it would be
giant giant,

1437
00:59:20,930 --> 00:59:23,010
like the size of a thumb.
Jesus.

1438
00:59:23,011 --> 00:59:24,080
Yeah.
It was crazy.

1439
00:59:24,230 --> 00:59:27,380
I showed it to Thompson girl once we
were at the airport

1440
00:59:28,070 --> 00:59:30,380
and I blew my nose into a tissue.
I go,

1441
00:59:30,381 --> 00:59:31,370
dude,
you got to look at this.

1442
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:33,970
And he looked,
they dry.

1443
00:59:35,490 --> 00:59:37,790
He's like,
he appreciated it though.

1444
00:59:37,791 --> 00:59:39,590
Right.
And that he really had a hard time

1445
00:59:39,591 --> 00:59:42,620
looking at it.
That's my favorite is just gross in hack

1446
00:59:42,621 --> 00:59:43,580
your friends.
Yeah.

1447
00:59:43,610 --> 00:59:46,610
Well that's one thing that fear factor
killed dead and me.

1448
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:47,291
Oh,
gross.

1449
00:59:47,291 --> 00:59:47,691
Yeah,
that's,

1450
00:59:47,691 --> 00:59:48,640
that's,
that's one of 'em.

1451
00:59:48,641 --> 00:59:49,970
Right.
Oh Wow.

1452
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,050
Yeah.
That came out of my nose,

1453
00:59:51,051 --> 00:59:52,460
son.
Jesus.

1454
00:59:52,610 --> 00:59:53,510
Yeah.
That was real.

1455
00:59:53,630 --> 00:59:55,820
I feel like you get name it.
It was giant.

1456
00:59:55,970 --> 00:59:57,680
I was like,
that doesn't even make sense.

1457
00:59:58,290 --> 00:59:59,780
Um,
I know I'm disgusting.

1458
00:59:59,870 --> 01:00:02,570
I showed you a booger,
but some more blood than it is a bugger.

1459
01:00:02,690 --> 01:00:05,000
I used to surf and a,
I was bad at it,

1460
01:00:05,001 --> 01:00:07,310
so I would get knocked underwater all
the time.

1461
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:09,470
Oh No.
Remember the first time I ever went,

1462
01:00:09,471 --> 01:00:11,480
I didn't realize it.
There's like when you were constantly

1463
01:00:11,481 --> 01:00:13,520
surfing,
you get water shoved up your nose all

1464
01:00:13,521 --> 01:00:15,770
the time.
So like there's just a moment where

1465
01:00:15,771 --> 01:00:19,970
you'll be out doing something and it'll
all just release because the pressure's

1466
01:00:19,971 --> 01:00:21,380
gone.
So remember I was like,

1467
01:00:21,381 --> 01:00:23,150
I don't know if it was like talking to
my girlfriend or something,

1468
01:00:23,151 --> 01:00:26,570
but I was just talking to someone and
then just all of a sudden just released

1469
01:00:26,571 --> 01:00:30,230
and I'm just talking to them and just
salt water all over my face.

1470
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:32,660
Whoa.
Just discussing that is discussed

1471
01:00:35,020 --> 01:00:37,480
dude.
Asteroids freaking me the fuck out.

1472
01:00:37,481 --> 01:00:39,460
Right.
We shouldn't have brought that up.

1473
01:00:40,630 --> 01:00:42,490
That's it.
That's one thing that could just change

1474
01:00:42,491 --> 01:00:43,360
everything.
Yeah.

1475
01:00:43,690 --> 01:00:46,660
And they happen all the time.
Like we just missed one.

1476
01:00:46,690 --> 01:00:49,690
One.
One came between us and the moon didn't,

1477
01:00:49,691 --> 01:00:53,610
it wasn't the one that recently came
between us and the moon and he trumps

1478
01:00:53,611 --> 01:00:56,580
going to build a wall or it's about to
see if,

1479
01:00:56,590 --> 01:00:57,910
see if you could find out what the hell
is.

1480
01:00:58,210 --> 01:00:59,200
By the way,
let's go champ.

1481
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:02,400
Everyone calls me that now what I want,
let's go champ.

1482
01:01:02,710 --> 01:01:04,360
Champ champion.
Such a great feeling.

1483
01:01:04,361 --> 01:01:07,630
It's to like,
I've got to open mikes and split champ

1484
01:01:07,660 --> 01:01:08,261
champ.
It was like,

1485
01:01:08,261 --> 01:01:08,980
God,
it feels good.

1486
01:01:08,980 --> 01:01:10,540
Do you know who Shannon Cannon Briggs
is?

1487
01:01:11,290 --> 01:01:14,980
The names hilarious instagram.
I had him on the podcast.

1488
01:01:14,990 --> 01:01:15,840
Steel chimp.
Yeah.

1489
01:01:15,850 --> 01:01:16,451
This,
that Sam.

1490
01:01:16,451 --> 01:01:18,010
Let's go champ.
That's where,

1491
01:01:18,011 --> 01:01:19,000
that's where the hat comes from.

1492
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,090
This is an authentic,
let's go champ hat from the source.

1493
01:01:22,150 --> 01:01:23,650
Oh my God.
That's the best.

1494
01:01:23,651 --> 01:01:27,430
I felt it appropriate to where you are
now.

1495
01:01:27,431 --> 01:01:29,090
The roast battle champ.
What happened?

1496
01:01:29,110 --> 01:01:32,740
January 9th January 9th Jesus Christ.
It was last month.

1497
01:01:32,741 --> 01:01:33,970
People.
That's insane.

1498
01:01:34,150 --> 01:01:35,860
Oh,
that's what scary.

1499
01:01:36,190 --> 01:01:40,960
We're in a goddamn shooting zone.
We're going to look a shooting gallery.

1500
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:43,810
Isn't that what a Randall Carlson was
saying?

1501
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:47,980
Is that how he described it?
We really are these right?

1502
01:01:48,850 --> 01:01:53,850
There's a bunch of shit out there that's
a 1,700 and something or enough or they

1503
01:01:54,251 --> 01:01:57,340
could kill us.
Asteroid came within the half the

1504
01:01:57,341 --> 01:02:02,341
distance from Earth to the moon flying
through cis lunar space.

1505
01:02:02,561 --> 01:02:06,160
What is CIS lunar?
Is that like the sex it was born with?

1506
01:02:07,610 --> 01:02:10,510
Yeah,
cause that's his gender to cis lunar.

1507
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:13,180
Is that connected to see fucking idiot
dude.

1508
01:02:13,181 --> 01:02:17,110
He was a new with is Sir prefixes.
What is the sis?

1509
01:02:18,310 --> 01:02:20,040
What is the SIS prefix?
What does that really

1510
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:22,140
mean?
There's someone online right now just

1511
01:02:22,141 --> 01:02:24,000
screaming at us.
You fucking idiot.

1512
01:02:24,001 --> 01:02:27,570
She didn't talk about space sis lunar
space this morning.

1513
01:02:27,571 --> 01:02:31,350
Scientists at the Catalina Sky Survey
discovered the asteroid,

1514
01:02:31,590 --> 01:02:36,360
which is being called Asteroid Two oh
one seven age 13 on Saturday.

1515
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:39,500
Discovered it on Saturday.
Jeez.

1516
01:02:39,550 --> 01:02:42,090
They discovered it on Saturday.
Is that what they're saying?

1517
01:02:42,230 --> 01:02:43,130
I think so,
yeah.

1518
01:02:43,350 --> 01:02:48,350
Oh my God.
50 to 111 feet across was moving at

1519
01:02:48,871 --> 01:02:51,480
about 10 miles per second.
Oh,

1520
01:02:51,481 --> 01:02:55,680
mine.
Miles per second with the same size as

1521
01:02:55,681 --> 01:02:58,990
the asteroid that hit Russia in 2013 the
size,

1522
01:02:59,020 --> 01:03:03,660
the asteroid coupled with how fast it
was moving and how low it's Albedo

1523
01:03:03,661 --> 01:03:08,661
brightness made it difficult to view
through a telescope that's fast,

1524
01:03:08,791 --> 01:03:12,510
that is,
see it's dark and they can't see it.

1525
01:03:12,570 --> 01:03:14,910
It's so fast.
I didn't see it.

1526
01:03:15,190 --> 01:03:16,370
Oh,

1527
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:19,060
that's insane to me.
Would you rather be on the east?

1528
01:03:19,130 --> 01:03:20,500
The fuck out of me,
man.

1529
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:22,650
Which steps be on the asteroid or on the
earth.

1530
01:03:23,850 --> 01:03:25,680
You want to be right under where it
hits.

1531
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:29,250
You don't want her to survive.
You don't want to be eating people.

1532
01:03:29,790 --> 01:03:32,070
You don't.
You just don't want that to go down.

1533
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:35,400
You don't want to get to that spot.
Are you eating people?

1534
01:03:35,970 --> 01:03:38,640
Cause that's where it goes it where it's
where it goes.

1535
01:03:38,670 --> 01:03:43,200
When it gets down to almost everyone's
dead and there's almost no life and

1536
01:03:43,201 --> 01:03:46,830
there's almost no food and there's just
all you need is one or two aggressive,

1537
01:03:46,860 --> 01:03:48,960
mean assholes.
And next thing you know,

1538
01:03:48,961 --> 01:03:52,290
you justify some shit and you're an an
on an episode of the walking dead

1539
01:03:52,410 --> 01:03:56,580
asteroid,
buzzed Earth and Moon January 25th what

1540
01:03:56,581 --> 01:03:59,040
does it,
another one's a different one.

1541
01:03:59,070 --> 01:04:01,590
Oh Jesus fucking Christ.
You're going to terrify joe today.

1542
01:04:02,010 --> 01:04:04,770
This is the January 25th one so the
other one was January of [inaudible] six

1543
01:04:04,771 --> 01:04:05,604
is that what it was?

1544
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:08,060
Seventh seventh or eighth I think.
Oh my God,

1545
01:04:08,090 --> 01:04:09,230
we're tripping about walls,
man.

1546
01:04:09,231 --> 01:04:10,550
We ain't tripping out to plug in the
asteroids.

1547
01:04:10,850 --> 01:04:12,950
Oh my God.
I found this one on the 20th,

1548
01:04:13,050 --> 01:04:16,620
she pass between Earth and the moon.
Late Tuesday night,

1549
01:04:16,650 --> 01:04:18,120
according to the clocks and the
Americas,

1550
01:04:18,121 --> 01:04:23,121
the asteroid closest approach was 1145
eastern time on January 24th,

1551
01:04:24,990 --> 01:04:25,670
2017 Dah,
Dah,

1552
01:04:25,670 --> 01:04:25,921
Dah,
Dah,

1553
01:04:25,921 --> 01:04:27,090
Dah.
Came within.

1554
01:04:27,750 --> 01:04:30,480
I don't know what that means.
Zero Point six eight lunar distances.

1555
01:04:30,510 --> 01:04:32,820
Whoops.
God Damn Popup Windows,

1556
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:37,950
um,
0.68 lunar distances about 61602000200

1557
01:04:37,951 --> 01:04:42,930
52 miles.
Slu broadcast a show about this asteroid

1558
01:04:42,931 --> 01:04:45,570
last night,
which you can see in the video above.

1559
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:46,650
And what website is this?

1560
01:04:46,930 --> 01:04:48,520
Uh,
Earth's chi.org.

1561
01:04:48,521 --> 01:04:51,010
But most of this information is keeps
coming from Slu,

1562
01:04:51,011 --> 01:04:52,880
which is an observatory.
Oh,

1563
01:04:53,350 --> 01:04:55,600
thank God.
Those guys are watching to see death

1564
01:04:55,601 --> 01:04:58,600
coming with not a goddamn thing we could
do about it of they tell us.

1565
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:00,170
Do you think they,
if,

1566
01:05:00,210 --> 01:05:02,080
if,
if an asteroid is going to hit her,

1567
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:03,870
do you think they tell trump?
No,

1568
01:05:03,910 --> 01:05:06,490
I don't know what you do.
What do you do if you know everybody's

1569
01:05:06,491 --> 01:05:07,060
dead?
Yeah.

1570
01:05:07,060 --> 01:05:08,830
Do you think?
He tells us like if they're,

1571
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:10,250
if you're not even,
it doesn't have to be trump,

1572
01:05:10,251 --> 01:05:12,550
but you think if you're the president
and you find out the world's going to

1573
01:05:12,551 --> 01:05:15,190
end because of an asteroid.
Do you tell everybody,

1574
01:05:15,490 --> 01:05:17,170
well,
no one wants to feel completely

1575
01:05:17,620 --> 01:05:18,120
helpless.

1576
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:19,720
Yeah,
but we absolutely are.

1577
01:05:20,170 --> 01:05:21,940
We've been hit by planets.
You fucks.

1578
01:05:22,090 --> 01:05:24,160
We could get hit by a goddamn planet.
Well,

1579
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:27,070
I don't know if you guys know this,
but they think there's another fucking

1580
01:05:27,071 --> 01:05:29,710
planet at the end of our solar system.
Now.

1581
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:33,880
They don't know where it is,
but they think it's six times bigger

1582
01:05:33,881 --> 01:05:36,220
than the earth.
I've actually heard that there's can't

1583
01:05:36,221 --> 01:05:40,330
see it because of the shadow steak.
It's crazy.

1584
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:43,330
This university's crazy.
There's rogue planets,

1585
01:05:43,660 --> 01:05:47,320
rogue planets go flying around and
slamming other planets like billiard

1586
01:05:47,321 --> 01:05:50,190
balls.
Then they find a planet that like live

1587
01:05:50,191 --> 01:05:54,070
they think is literally just a diamond
dude.

1588
01:05:54,071 --> 01:05:56,020
I was,
I was high as fuck once and I went

1589
01:05:56,021 --> 01:06:01,021
outside and it was foggy and the moon
was full and it was foggy and so it was

1590
01:06:01,841 --> 01:06:06,841
this crazy illusion like there was a
enormous moon flying in the sky.

1591
01:06:08,650 --> 01:06:09,970
Oh,
enormous moon.

1592
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,450
Like many,
many times larger than the moon itself.

1593
01:06:13,630 --> 01:06:16,510
Like it was almost like another planet,
like she's hovering right over us

1594
01:06:16,690 --> 01:06:20,920
because of the glow of the moon.
And I remember looking at that man and

1595
01:06:20,921 --> 01:06:25,780
thinking to myself that could,
that could be another reality.

1596
01:06:26,230 --> 01:06:29,710
There could be another planet somewhere
out there in the universe that is

1597
01:06:29,711 --> 01:06:34,600
looking up at this gigantic thing that's
like a up another planet,

1598
01:06:34,780 --> 01:06:37,240
just floating row right above you.
And there's,

1599
01:06:37,270 --> 01:06:39,130
they're everywhere.
They're everywhere.

1600
01:06:39,131 --> 01:06:43,360
They keep finding new ones,
which are just flying through this shit

1601
01:06:43,630 --> 01:06:48,630
storm of planets in nuclear explosions.
Fuck man,

1602
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:54,120
that's crazier than anything that we,
we ever contemplate on this earth while

1603
01:06:55,121 --> 01:06:58,060
we're alive.
Just the very nature of space itself.

1604
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:00,190
There's a,
I think there's a diagram of like the

1605
01:07:00,191 --> 01:07:03,130
biggest son,
the other biggest star they found in the

1606
01:07:03,131 --> 01:07:05,080
universe and then they compare it to
ours.

1607
01:07:05,081 --> 01:07:06,310
Current son.
That's insane.

1608
01:07:06,340 --> 01:07:09,220
And it's just,
it's unfathomably big.

1609
01:07:09,250 --> 01:07:10,010
It's insane.

1610
01:07:10,010 --> 01:07:11,010
One of the cool,
uh,

1611
01:07:12,020 --> 01:07:13,360
I guess it's a demo.
It's an,

1612
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:17,150
it's an application on the vr thing I've
got on the HTC vive.

1613
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:19,310
You can go into space and,
uh,

1614
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:22,880
like generate planets and send them into
orbit and you're just standing in the

1615
01:07:22,881 --> 01:07:26,720
middle of it and you can make that Alec
Alpha Centauri Star and then watch what

1616
01:07:26,721 --> 01:07:29,500
it looks like when you send the earth
around it and then they explode into

1617
01:07:29,510 --> 01:07:32,750
each other and you can,
you can just keep making them pop up and

1618
01:07:32,751 --> 01:07:33,950
what have you.
Just stand there for hours.

1619
01:07:33,951 --> 01:07:35,180
It looks,
it's super cool.

1620
01:07:35,181 --> 01:07:36,530
Okay.
Wow.

1621
01:07:37,790 --> 01:07:38,630
Damn University.

1622
01:07:38,950 --> 01:07:42,140
My girlfriend's super into science and
conspiracy things and stuff.

1623
01:07:42,141 --> 01:07:44,210
So this is literally all we talk about.
Well,

1624
01:07:44,211 --> 01:07:47,090
I think that you're going to get to a
point where virtual reality is going to

1625
01:07:47,091 --> 01:07:49,370
be able to recreate a journey through
space.

1626
01:07:49,371 --> 01:07:51,710
I can age d oh you know,
if they can,

1627
01:07:51,740 --> 01:07:55,760
if they can figure out a way to take
really good photos,

1628
01:07:55,761 --> 01:07:58,520
like some of the more recent photos
they've been able to take with those

1629
01:07:58,521 --> 01:08:03,170
satellites that they launch into space,
they're the incredible detail of all

1630
01:08:03,171 --> 01:08:07,400
these different planets.
I mean to be able to do that,

1631
01:08:07,401 --> 01:08:11,600
like to put on one of those htc vives
and the fly through space insane and

1632
01:08:11,601 --> 01:08:15,680
just feel what it would be like to
circled Jupiter and like look at it.

1633
01:08:15,710 --> 01:08:18,050
You know,
that's all you get lost in for.

1634
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:19,910
Oh,
I would love to do just weed and

1635
01:08:19,911 --> 01:08:21,380
mushrooms on that.
That'd be crazy.

1636
01:08:21,470 --> 01:08:22,850
He might not even need it,
dude.

1637
01:08:22,910 --> 01:08:24,920
That's true.
Might go into a natural psychedelic

1638
01:08:24,921 --> 01:08:27,950
state if you could.
If you could get something or you could

1639
01:08:27,951 --> 01:08:32,930
in a float tank,
put on an htc vive and go for real.

1640
01:08:32,931 --> 01:08:36,650
Right.
And Go flying through like the rings of

1641
01:08:36,651 --> 01:08:40,260
Saturn and to be like that close and,
and to,

1642
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:42,530
to have like the correct.
Whoa.

1643
01:08:42,890 --> 01:08:47,150
Watch this incredible moment.
An Indian rocket releases over 100

1644
01:08:47,151 --> 01:08:49,700
satellites into space in a new world
record.

1645
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:51,740
What,
see,

1646
01:08:51,741 --> 01:08:53,680
that's another thing.
Oh,

1647
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:54,770
space junk.
Correct.

1648
01:08:55,820 --> 01:08:59,420
The aid of a merchant are going to try
to take a picture of earth every single

1649
01:08:59,420 --> 01:09:00,510
day.
Oh my God.

1650
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:02,750
It seems like they're trying to do
exactly almost what you were trying to

1651
01:09:02,751 --> 01:09:03,710
talk about right there.

1652
01:09:04,710 --> 01:09:06,120
Um,
did you see this?

1653
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:08,670
There was a,
some sort of a,

1654
01:09:08,671 --> 01:09:12,900
um,
a plan to collect space junk that

1655
01:09:12,901 --> 01:09:14,790
failed.
Did you hear about that?

1656
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:16,610
That is nearby.

1657
01:09:16,940 --> 01:09:18,470
Oh yes.
Stays Japanese.

1658
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:20,150
What is a Japanese,
uh,

1659
01:09:20,570 --> 01:09:21,381
yeah,
yeah.

1660
01:09:21,381 --> 01:09:23,380
Space junks insane.
That's what I,

1661
01:09:23,430 --> 01:09:24,740
that's where the part we're,
we're,

1662
01:09:24,750 --> 01:09:26,480
we're at,
this is where we got to build something

1663
01:09:26,481 --> 01:09:28,850
to go collect all the space junk.
Yeah,

1664
01:09:28,851 --> 01:09:31,580
we're crazy.
We left shit floating in the sky above

1665
01:09:31,581 --> 01:09:34,250
our head.
We've got metal.

1666
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:38,030
We left metal in the sky above our head.
Oh,

1667
01:09:38,031 --> 01:09:39,410
it failed.
It's great.

1668
01:09:39,411 --> 01:09:42,920
The Japanese space junk remover
experiment has failed in orbit.

1669
01:09:43,010 --> 01:09:43,461
Would,
uh,

1670
01:09:43,461 --> 01:09:44,750
what happened to it?
Is it saying,

1671
01:09:44,810 --> 01:09:46,340
wait,
does that mean that there's more junk

1672
01:09:46,341 --> 01:09:48,620
now in space?
I don't know if that,

1673
01:09:48,650 --> 01:09:50,960
I don't know if they made it back and
couldn't catch it.

1674
01:09:51,950 --> 01:09:56,840
The system designed by a Japanese space
agency and a fishing net company should

1675
01:09:56,841 --> 01:10:01,841
have unfurled a 700 meter a tether from
space station risks resupply vehicle

1676
01:10:05,151 --> 01:10:08,900
that was returning to earth according to
j a x a scientist.

1677
01:10:08,901 --> 01:10:11,360
However,
the system appears to have faltered.

1678
01:10:12,290 --> 01:10:17,150
Space junk is a growing problem in low
earth orbit since the beginning of the

1679
01:10:17,151 --> 01:10:20,750
space.
Age Debris as small as flecks of paint.

1680
01:10:20,751 --> 01:10:23,630
Wow.
Enlarge as whole satellites and parts of

1681
01:10:23,631 --> 01:10:28,460
rocket boosters have been accumulating
and is estimated that over 100 million

1682
01:10:28,610 --> 01:10:30,740
individual pieces of junk.
Wow.

1683
01:10:30,830 --> 01:10:35,420
Tens of thousands of peep pieces that
are over 10 centimeters in size are

1684
01:10:35,421 --> 01:10:40,421
whizzing around our planet.
That's like moving shrapnel.

1685
01:10:41,810 --> 01:10:46,400
Oh my God,
we're so crazy.

1686
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:49,760
It's insane.
People are so bananas.

1687
01:10:49,761 --> 01:10:51,260
They just keep launching new shit up
there.

1688
01:10:51,261 --> 01:10:52,094
They're like,
well,

1689
01:10:52,490 --> 01:10:55,610
it's fucked already.
Let's launch a hundred more new ones.

1690
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:58,300
Didn't Elan Musk said they want to
launch a certain,

1691
01:10:58,310 --> 01:11:00,020
like a crazy number of a space,

1692
01:11:00,900 --> 01:11:03,020
one a month or one a.
What?

1693
01:11:03,100 --> 01:11:05,100
Are they leaving debris in space too?
I don't know.

1694
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:06,750
I'm not sure.
Is that bringing the thing back?

1695
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:07,830
So maybe not.
Yeah.

1696
01:11:07,831 --> 01:11:09,600
Right.
If you can get something that you can

1697
01:11:09,601 --> 01:11:12,270
shoot up there and then bring back,
what do you go to space.

1698
01:11:12,330 --> 01:11:13,620
If you good puck,
Yo,

1699
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:16,170
you wouldn't even just,
I mean if it was just like top and then

1700
01:11:16,171 --> 01:11:18,150
come right back down.
A whole joke about that.

1701
01:11:18,210 --> 01:11:21,930
I go look up.
You're already in space going out there.

1702
01:11:21,931 --> 01:11:23,640
It's like just go into a Shittier
neighborhood.

1703
01:11:23,670 --> 01:11:24,740
Yeah.
You want to check out the shit and

1704
01:11:24,750 --> 01:11:26,510
neighborhood?
No,

1705
01:11:26,790 --> 01:11:28,710
you're getting planes all the time.
What if it just went a little higher?

1706
01:11:28,711 --> 01:11:29,900
Yeah,
exactly will.

1707
01:11:29,910 --> 01:11:31,490
It doesn't.
That's why I get in place.

1708
01:11:31,650 --> 01:11:33,350
I think that's what's,
fuck.

1709
01:11:34,350 --> 01:11:36,990
I think there's going to get to a point
where the planes are going to get to

1710
01:11:36,991 --> 01:11:37,830
places faster.

1711
01:11:37,830 --> 01:11:40,350
They're gonna use the orbit and go up
high and then come right back down.

1712
01:11:40,410 --> 01:11:43,770
Or you smoke a joint.
Go to Joshua tree and lay on your back

1713
01:11:43,771 --> 01:11:47,190
and realize you are already in space.
You're already here.

1714
01:11:47,580 --> 01:11:49,620
We're in space.
We're just in the best possible

1715
01:11:49,621 --> 01:11:51,810
neighborhood.
Let's just be thankful.

1716
01:11:51,870 --> 01:11:54,390
Just be super lucky that we're here.
We,

1717
01:11:54,470 --> 01:11:56,940
we weren't shit out on the moon where
there's no air.

1718
01:11:57,210 --> 01:11:58,080
That's true.
Yeah,

1719
01:11:58,081 --> 01:11:59,700
man.
I mean you like extreme stuff.

1720
01:11:59,701 --> 01:12:01,080
You wouldn't,
might want to just see what it was like,

1721
01:12:01,081 --> 01:12:05,100
fuck you.
I don't like things that will definitely

1722
01:12:05,101 --> 01:12:05,830
kill you.
Oh,

1723
01:12:05,830 --> 01:12:08,310
okay.
And the like going into space can

1724
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:09,330
definitely kill you.
Oh,

1725
01:12:09,331 --> 01:12:10,230
absolutely.
Like,

1726
01:12:10,231 --> 01:12:11,041
yeah,
it goes wrong.

1727
01:12:11,041 --> 01:12:13,680
A lie.
It goes wrong a lot on those folks.

1728
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:15,810
Like I'm terrified of heights,
so I'll probably never go,

1729
01:12:15,811 --> 01:12:18,000
but that movie gravity.
Oh yeah.

1730
01:12:18,110 --> 01:12:20,240
Don't be freaked me the fuck out.
Oh yeah.

1731
01:12:20,250 --> 01:12:21,870
That's sitting there going,
Jesus,

1732
01:12:21,871 --> 01:12:23,730
get back down there,
get down,

1733
01:12:24,030 --> 01:12:26,940
get down.
Her anxieties.

1734
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:28,270
So real.
It's part of it.

1735
01:12:28,271 --> 01:12:30,240
The fuck out of there.
You're floating in space.

1736
01:12:30,470 --> 01:12:33,600
You hear the things crashed together,
but they don't make any sound or you see

1737
01:12:33,601 --> 01:12:35,550
them crash together,
but there's no sound.

1738
01:12:35,580 --> 01:12:38,910
That was a freaky part of that movie
where there's no sound in space because

1739
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:40,380
there's no oxygen.
There's no air,

1740
01:12:40,381 --> 01:12:41,880
there's nothing to carry it.
There's nothing.

1741
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:42,400
It's no APP.

1742
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:43,820
That's fair.
You don't hear it.

1743
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:46,130
Does that make sense though?
Yeah.

1744
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:50,630
Just real quick on that.
The asked for the hit Jupiter,

1745
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:55,040
it wasn't the size of earth.
The explosion was the size of earth,

1746
01:12:55,580 --> 01:12:58,630
however difference that makes.
But the explosion was the side of the

1747
01:12:58,631 --> 01:12:59,330
road.
Yeah,

1748
01:12:59,330 --> 01:13:00,830
I think we said that.
I'm pretty sure.

1749
01:13:00,831 --> 01:13:01,940
I'm just making sure.
Yeah.

1750
01:13:02,570 --> 01:13:04,930
Yeah.
I don't think the astro was decided if

1751
01:13:04,931 --> 01:13:06,860
it was a big dog,
be like another planet flying around.

1752
01:13:06,861 --> 01:13:07,671
Right.
Well,

1753
01:13:07,671 --> 01:13:09,770
that has happened though.
That's what we're saying.

1754
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:11,990
I don't know.
I mean who knows how often does it

1755
01:13:12,010 --> 01:13:14,030
happen,
but they think that's how what were

1756
01:13:14,031 --> 01:13:17,270
saying before the debts,
see if he could find that earth one in

1757
01:13:17,300 --> 01:13:19,100
earth too.
I think that's what they're saying,

1758
01:13:19,101 --> 01:13:23,630
that that was the most recent theory of
how the moon was created,

1759
01:13:24,050 --> 01:13:28,830
that the moon is actually made out of
the same shit that were made out of just

1760
01:13:28,850 --> 01:13:30,470
dead as fuck floating in the sky.

1761
01:13:30,530 --> 01:13:33,440
Our brother,
it's her dead brother floating over our

1762
01:13:33,441 --> 01:13:35,780
head every day,
but he's only like 10 that's why so

1763
01:13:35,781 --> 01:13:36,980
little.
And it's like the one that's still

1764
01:13:36,981 --> 01:13:38,930
attached to us,
dude.

1765
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:39,920
I mean,
that is what it's like,

1766
01:13:39,921 --> 01:13:40,754
right?
Yeah.

1767
01:13:41,420 --> 01:13:42,880
That could be us.
I couldn't be as,

1768
01:13:42,881 --> 01:13:44,930
we're so lucky.
It's what I'm going to work hard bitch

1769
01:13:44,980 --> 01:13:48,620
and complain
Weird Times.

1770
01:13:48,860 --> 01:13:51,380
Yeah.
Because it will all this information,

1771
01:13:51,381 --> 01:13:56,060
like I'm sure it was probably around
when my parents were my age,

1772
01:13:56,540 --> 01:13:58,130
but uh,
in order to go get it,

1773
01:13:58,131 --> 01:14:00,560
you had to do a lot of traveling.
You had to read books.

1774
01:14:00,561 --> 01:14:02,480
He had a,
he had to go to school.

1775
01:14:02,610 --> 01:14:05,210
Like you couldn't just google it.
No,

1776
01:14:05,211 --> 01:14:09,160
everything's so readily available now.
Don't you think like for comics it's

1777
01:14:09,180 --> 01:14:11,210
like the best time ever for creating
material?

1778
01:14:11,230 --> 01:14:12,130
Absolutely.

1779
01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:14,440
That's why it's like,
I mean I talk about trump and stuff all

1780
01:14:14,441 --> 01:14:17,220
the time,
but it's like I've never seen a

1781
01:14:17,230 --> 01:14:19,720
president that's just given us so much
stuff to work with.

1782
01:14:19,990 --> 01:14:21,710
A comic said this to me.
Uh,

1783
01:14:22,270 --> 01:14:23,320
he was like,
he was like,

1784
01:14:23,321 --> 01:14:24,620
I'm,
I'm not gonna write any trump jokes.

1785
01:14:24,621 --> 01:14:25,181
So I was like,
why not?

1786
01:14:25,181 --> 01:14:27,010
And he's like,
cause that dude's doing funnier shit

1787
01:14:27,011 --> 01:14:28,550
than anything I'll ever be able to
write.

1788
01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:33,520
I feel,
I feel bad about it.

1789
01:14:34,290 --> 01:14:36,020
Is it just fit?
It doesn't feel,

1790
01:14:36,050 --> 01:14:38,540
this is my feeling.
It doesn't feel like everybody's happy

1791
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:40,700
now.
Everyone's not happy and when people

1792
01:14:40,701 --> 01:14:44,660
aren't happy on both sides,
like this seems to be all this fucking,

1793
01:14:47,010 --> 01:14:48,620
it seems super tense right now.

1794
01:14:48,710 --> 01:14:49,760
No,
I think we were talking about this

1795
01:14:49,761 --> 01:14:51,920
early.
No one's willing to listen and learn.

1796
01:14:52,100 --> 01:14:54,820
Everyone's just willing to shout as loud
as possible.

1797
01:14:54,821 --> 01:14:56,540
Yeah.
People just kind of be nice.

1798
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:58,100
Yeah.
And that's why I like doing stand up

1799
01:14:58,101 --> 01:15:01,100
about it,
cause it's like if I can make both sides

1800
01:15:01,101 --> 01:15:04,660
laugh at this,
the stupid things I'm saying when

1801
01:15:04,661 --> 01:15:08,990
they're in a way agreeing with me and
then in a way can hopefully learn a

1802
01:15:08,991 --> 01:15:10,160
little bit different.
Yeah.

1803
01:15:10,270 --> 01:15:13,990
I think we're too much of a bunch of
babies to have a left side and a right

1804
01:15:13,991 --> 01:15:15,490
side.
I think we're too,

1805
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:18,670
we're too much of babies were,
were squawking too much.

1806
01:15:18,730 --> 01:15:19,570
Yeah.
You know,

1807
01:15:19,630 --> 01:15:24,190
I think if we could figure out a way to
get rid of that,

1808
01:15:24,550 --> 01:15:28,660
that whole,
that whole inclination to want a left

1809
01:15:28,661 --> 01:15:32,440
and a right,
that whole inclination just seems to me

1810
01:15:32,441 --> 01:15:37,180
that it's just so easy to pick a team
and to get locked into that team's

1811
01:15:37,181 --> 01:15:39,790
mindset.
Locked in that team's goals locked in

1812
01:15:39,791 --> 01:15:43,000
that team's ideology.
Say the shit that the other people in

1813
01:15:43,001 --> 01:15:45,370
the team.
I see so many people that have right

1814
01:15:45,371 --> 01:15:48,190
their tweets now and afterwards they
write sad.

1815
01:15:49,660 --> 01:15:51,670
It's hilarious.
I mean,

1816
01:15:51,940 --> 01:15:54,580
it's kind of funny in an ironic way.
If they mean it.

1817
01:15:54,610 --> 01:15:55,870
Ironically.
It's funny,

1818
01:15:56,830 --> 01:16:01,000
but it's,
it's really funny when they don't mean

1819
01:16:01,001 --> 01:16:01,770
it.
Ironically,

1820
01:16:01,770 --> 01:16:04,180
and they were like mimicking the way
trump tweets.

1821
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:05,740
Yeah,
I see it.

1822
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:07,970
It's so common now.
We got sad

1823
01:16:08,220 --> 01:16:10,050
president of the tweets.
I know.

1824
01:16:10,051 --> 01:16:11,130
It's amazing.
I mean,

1825
01:16:11,190 --> 01:16:12,900
hope it doesn't tweet.
I know,

1826
01:16:12,901 --> 01:16:13,890
right?
Shit.

1827
01:16:14,130 --> 01:16:15,410
He don't know what the fuck they're
talking about.

1828
01:16:15,420 --> 01:16:18,410
That was taken out of context.
That's a bad trump impression.

1829
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:19,800
He's like,
Matthew were shark should have won.

1830
01:16:21,390 --> 01:16:23,040
He has a,
what is this?

1831
01:16:24,010 --> 01:16:24,990
This is what I could find on that

1832
01:16:25,020 --> 01:16:28,980
giant impact creates moon the
scientist's theory on a giant impact

1833
01:16:28,981 --> 01:16:31,200
model seeking to explain the moon's
creation.

1834
01:16:31,950 --> 01:16:35,880
Experts believe that an object that
crashed into earth led to debris that

1835
01:16:35,881 --> 01:16:39,060
later form the moon.
New Theory says that incident also

1836
01:16:39,061 --> 01:16:40,860
created a smaller second moon.

1837
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:42,490
Whoa,
where's that?

1838
01:16:42,670 --> 01:16:44,620
And it's these two minutes right here.
It says,

1839
01:16:44,621 --> 01:16:47,770
day they collided to create what we see
now.

1840
01:16:47,980 --> 01:16:51,100
Oh Jesus Christ.
It was really hard finding stuff on this

1841
01:16:51,130 --> 01:16:52,810
earth.
One earth to stuff really brings up just

1842
01:16:52,811 --> 01:16:54,280
a lot of stuff on DC.
Wow.

1843
01:16:54,281 --> 01:16:55,200
How would they figure it?
These

1844
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:58,110
fucking people are so goddamn smart.
Look at this.

1845
01:16:58,111 --> 01:17:01,380
Their theory also says the slow,
the slow impact force,

1846
01:17:01,381 --> 01:17:05,850
most of the smaller moon to attach to
the side of the moon as a thick new

1847
01:17:05,851 --> 01:17:08,490
layer of the lunar cross.
How the fuck did you figure that out?

1848
01:17:09,140 --> 01:17:10,010
They're destined to

1849
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:11,690
collide.
There's no way out.

1850
01:17:13,380 --> 01:17:14,580
Yeah.
You should freak out,

1851
01:17:14,581 --> 01:17:17,340
folks.
Everyone should freak out and then let's

1852
01:17:17,341 --> 01:17:18,330
relax.
Oh,

1853
01:17:18,331 --> 01:17:20,490
yikes.
This is what's the most important thing

1854
01:17:20,491 --> 01:17:24,450
to realize.
No matter what we're in space no matter

1855
01:17:24,451 --> 01:17:25,950
what.
No matter what you're saying.

1856
01:17:26,150 --> 01:17:26,541
The,
the,

1857
01:17:26,541 --> 01:17:28,320
the,
the reality of what you're looking at,

1858
01:17:28,321 --> 01:17:30,780
what you're focusing on.
If you look close to your,

1859
01:17:31,010 --> 01:17:32,990
your neighborhood or your,
your,

1860
01:17:33,110 --> 01:17:37,620
your city or your country,
all of it is taking place in this ball

1861
01:17:37,621 --> 01:17:39,930
hurling through infinity ass like that
is,

1862
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:41,980
it's all figurative.
We,

1863
01:17:41,981 --> 01:17:44,220
we've,
we're creating all of these social

1864
01:17:44,221 --> 01:17:45,120
constructs.
Well,

1865
01:17:45,121 --> 01:17:46,710
they're there.
You got to deal with them.

1866
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:49,530
You mean you got to deal with the
consequences of,

1867
01:17:49,680 --> 01:17:50,513
you know,

1868
01:17:52,260 --> 01:17:54,180
assholes.
It fuck things up over here.

1869
01:17:54,860 --> 01:17:58,080
Yeah.
These Hitler felt fellows and when you

1870
01:17:58,081 --> 01:18:00,330
get a Hitler really got to do something
about it,

1871
01:18:00,690 --> 01:18:01,850
you know,
he's not going to get to,

1872
01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:03,960
you can't just hug it out of him.
No,

1873
01:18:03,990 --> 01:18:06,880
no,
I do you think it get some beach?

1874
01:18:07,980 --> 01:18:09,300
Well,
I'm not saying he's Hitler.

1875
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:11,070
Oh,
of course it talking about Hitler.

1876
01:18:11,150 --> 01:18:12,920
Yeah.
I wasn't talking about him like,

1877
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:15,360
like what people call other people that
he's like Hitler.

1878
01:18:15,361 --> 01:18:18,060
I never used that term and I don't think
he is like Hitler.

1879
01:18:18,180 --> 01:18:18,961
No,
no,

1880
01:18:18,961 --> 01:18:20,640
he's not because he's not killing
people.

1881
01:18:20,690 --> 01:18:21,730
Then also,
you know,

1882
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:24,390
they Hitler's a whole total different,
no,

1883
01:18:24,391 --> 01:18:25,990
Hitler was Hitler.
Yeah.

1884
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:27,870
Like it's solar.
It's so stupid.

1885
01:18:27,871 --> 01:18:30,900
I think borough had a bit about it.
He has on his new specials.

1886
01:18:31,770 --> 01:18:32,970
Have you seen him?
I haven't seen his,

1887
01:18:32,990 --> 01:18:34,530
especially special.
It's so great.

1888
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:35,780
I saw him do the stand up.
I need,

1889
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:38,310
I need to sit down and watch it.
And it was one of my favorites.

1890
01:18:38,311 --> 01:18:40,410
My favorite is watching him pop into the
store and do it.

1891
01:18:40,411 --> 01:18:43,350
And I watched him do that bit and it's
such a funny bit cause he's got a great

1892
01:18:43,351 --> 01:18:44,760
point.
Yeah,

1893
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:49,590
he definitely does.
And I think it's a tired word now is,

1894
01:18:49,910 --> 01:18:52,680
and no one's going to bring that fucking
mustache back though.

1895
01:18:53,790 --> 01:18:54,930
I'll do it.
You think so?

1896
01:18:54,970 --> 01:18:55,740
I'll,
I'll bring it back.

1897
01:18:55,740 --> 01:18:56,610
No,
I'm just kidding.

1898
01:18:57,120 --> 01:18:58,830
Already did it once.
More it on stage.

1899
01:18:58,831 --> 01:19:00,660
People were so angry at him.
He's like,

1900
01:19:00,661 --> 01:19:01,860
I'm a Jew.
I could do it.

1901
01:19:02,030 --> 01:19:06,180
I would you pass.
It's so funny.

1902
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:08,490
It's funny the things that we find
offensive.

1903
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:10,710
Yeah.
It's a weird time for that.

1904
01:19:10,740 --> 01:19:11,573
Yeah,
it is.

1905
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:14,400
People are getting really upset,
upset at,

1906
01:19:14,401 --> 01:19:15,690
um,
people talking about,

1907
01:19:15,710 --> 01:19:18,360
you know,
pretty much any subject that isn't about

1908
01:19:18,361 --> 01:19:20,040
them as an individual.

1909
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:21,120
And then if you do,
like,

1910
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:23,940
if you do a subject,
if you're a white man,

1911
01:19:23,970 --> 01:19:27,120
you should be writing entirely about
what a white man does,

1912
01:19:27,121 --> 01:19:28,170
period.
That's it.

1913
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:31,170
Just about white men.
And even then you shouldn't be doing it

1914
01:19:31,171 --> 01:19:33,060
because you should shut the fuck up.
Nah,

1915
01:19:33,061 --> 01:19:33,894
man.
Yeah.

1916
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:36,270
Now I,
I was things like you can say whatever

1917
01:19:36,271 --> 01:19:38,190
you can,
I believe in freedom of speech more than

1918
01:19:38,191 --> 01:19:40,170
anything,
but I also believe that you have to deal

1919
01:19:40,171 --> 01:19:42,300
with the consequences of what you say
fuck Yo.

1920
01:19:42,930 --> 01:19:46,860
But it's also like we have to stop
looking at each other as groups,

1921
01:19:48,100 --> 01:19:50,400
white man as groups,
as white women as group.

1922
01:19:50,401 --> 01:19:51,480
So it was taught,
it's silly.

1923
01:19:51,690 --> 01:19:54,630
We're just a bunch of fucking people.
We got to stop looking each other as

1924
01:19:54,631 --> 01:19:58,200
these groups based on what we look like
or what part of the country we're in and

1925
01:19:58,201 --> 01:20:00,240
that's eventually going to move to other
countries.

1926
01:20:00,270 --> 01:20:02,940
It's just going to take time.
I just wonder when,

1927
01:20:02,941 --> 01:20:05,490
you know,
cause the kind of relationship that we

1928
01:20:06,060 --> 01:20:08,040
have with each other all in together in

1929
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:11,910
a city like this and live in so
comfortably and for the most part like

1930
01:20:11,940 --> 01:20:14,450
relatively low crime,
even in a place like Los Angeles,

1931
01:20:14,451 --> 01:20:17,460
if you really consider it that never
existed in history.

1932
01:20:17,490 --> 01:20:20,340
This is a new thing.
So people get better at life,

1933
01:20:20,370 --> 01:20:23,460
they get better at figuring it out.
I think we're better now than ever

1934
01:20:23,461 --> 01:20:24,930
before.
Even though we still fuck it up.

1935
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:26,010
Yeah.
But we're,

1936
01:20:26,070 --> 01:20:30,480
we're real close to one day recognizing
other countries just like states,

1937
01:20:31,020 --> 01:20:32,040
just like,
you know,

1938
01:20:32,041 --> 01:20:33,960
like you could just pack up and move to
Florida,

1939
01:20:34,020 --> 01:20:34,591
you know,
there's,

1940
01:20:34,591 --> 01:20:38,220
there's going to be situations like that
where people just go all over the world

1941
01:20:38,221 --> 01:20:39,120
and go wherever they want.

1942
01:20:39,170 --> 01:20:40,610
Yeah.
It's going to be weird.

1943
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:41,451
It's going to be,
I mean,

1944
01:20:41,451 --> 01:20:44,480
it's also just progress.
Someone said it's like progress is

1945
01:20:44,930 --> 01:20:47,450
measured generate or by tombstone.
By tombstone.

1946
01:20:48,050 --> 01:20:48,861
Yeah.
That makes sense.

1947
01:20:48,861 --> 01:20:50,840
True.
Where it's like I look at my grandfather

1948
01:20:50,841 --> 01:20:53,360
and like he's,
I love him to death and he was an

1949
01:20:53,361 --> 01:20:57,560
immigrant to this country and he felt a
certain way around about other people

1950
01:20:57,561 --> 01:20:59,690
and races and it was one of those things
where it's like,

1951
01:20:59,691 --> 01:21:00,320
I,
growing up,

1952
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:02,120
growing up around that,
I realized it's like,

1953
01:21:02,121 --> 01:21:03,830
oh,
that's just kind of the way he thinks.

1954
01:21:03,831 --> 01:21:08,210
I don't have to think that way.
I can treat people nice and be cool with

1955
01:21:08,211 --> 01:21:10,190
everybody.
Yeah.

1956
01:21:10,370 --> 01:21:11,203
Yeah.
It's,

1957
01:21:11,240 --> 01:21:13,550
I think that's more apparent now than
ever before.

1958
01:21:13,570 --> 01:21:14,403
Yeah.

1959
01:21:14,440 --> 01:21:17,380
I think that some people were more aware
of,

1960
01:21:17,381 --> 01:21:18,940
um,
the,

1961
01:21:18,941 --> 01:21:22,300
the similarities that we all share
versus the differences more than ever

1962
01:21:22,301 --> 01:21:26,050
before and people were more vocal I
think anytime in my life that I can

1963
01:21:26,051 --> 01:21:27,580
remember.
I'm sure that during the civil rights

1964
01:21:27,581 --> 01:21:29,740
movement people were very vocal about
racial,

1965
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:31,720
racial rights and,
uh,

1966
01:21:32,020 --> 01:21:32,750
you know,
when,

1967
01:21:32,750 --> 01:21:35,710
uh,
putting out of stomping out racial

1968
01:21:35,711 --> 01:21:38,140
hatred,
but I don't remember it being like as

1969
01:21:38,141 --> 01:21:41,710
much in the public forum as it is during
the last,

1970
01:21:41,711 --> 01:21:46,240
like say like maybe 10 years or so.
It seems like the people have,

1971
01:21:47,110 --> 01:21:49,720
they're much more organized in their
ability to,

1972
01:21:49,750 --> 01:21:51,760
uh,
to protest,

1973
01:21:51,761 --> 01:21:53,860
to educate people,
to explain things,

1974
01:21:53,861 --> 01:21:56,830
to show things that people might not
have been aware of before.

1975
01:21:57,670 --> 01:21:58,380
I think it's a lot of

1976
01:21:58,380 --> 01:21:59,100
just,
um,

1977
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:03,630
social media and just the Internet and
having all that just readily more

1978
01:22:03,631 --> 01:22:04,980
available.
Yeah,

1979
01:22:04,981 --> 01:22:07,960
there's definitely that.
I think people like,

1980
01:22:08,430 --> 01:22:11,580
I think people arguing having these
conversations are super important.

1981
01:22:11,610 --> 01:22:14,610
Even if they do get shouty and stuff.
Cause that's,

1982
01:22:14,611 --> 01:22:16,920
I think that's how you learn is you have
to have these awkward hard

1983
01:22:16,921 --> 01:22:17,754
conversations.

1984
01:22:17,860 --> 01:22:18,940
Yeah.
And they're there.

1985
01:22:18,970 --> 01:22:20,420
It's really hard.
It's,

1986
01:22:20,570 --> 01:22:21,820
it's hard to,
uh,

1987
01:22:22,210 --> 01:22:26,290
it's hard to think that every time you,
you buy anything,

1988
01:22:26,740 --> 01:22:28,470
anytime you,
uh,

1989
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:30,640
anytime you do any kind of interacting
with someone,

1990
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:35,080
you're these,
a lot of the stuff that you're getting

1991
01:22:35,081 --> 01:22:40,000
is coming from places where people live
hard lives like really hard lives.

1992
01:22:40,270 --> 01:22:42,400
Like the,
and people will argue,

1993
01:22:42,401 --> 01:22:43,120
well,
hey,

1994
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:44,470
this is what we've talked about this
recently.

1995
01:22:44,471 --> 01:22:44,861
They were like,
well,

1996
01:22:44,861 --> 01:22:45,281
hey,
you know,

1997
01:22:45,281 --> 01:22:48,580
that's how countries grow and prosper
and you know,

1998
01:22:48,581 --> 01:22:50,440
they have to start out this way and they
have this,

1999
01:22:50,580 --> 01:22:51,670
you know,
revolution,

2000
01:22:51,680 --> 01:22:53,500
industrial revolution and all these
people,

2001
01:22:53,501 --> 01:22:58,090
they start manufacturing things.
A status of life goes up,

2002
01:22:58,091 --> 01:23:01,360
the quality of life goes up.
Your living much better than they ever

2003
01:23:01,361 --> 01:23:02,770
lived before.
Yeah.

2004
01:23:02,771 --> 01:23:04,360
But they don't,
they don't live like us.

2005
01:23:04,390 --> 01:23:05,220
Yeah.
All right.

2006
01:23:05,220 --> 01:23:06,580
Is that it?

2007
01:23:06,690 --> 01:23:07,850
That's okay.
Yeah,

2008
01:23:08,350 --> 01:23:09,070
I dunno.
I mean,

2009
01:23:09,070 --> 01:23:12,450
went from mud house,
mud huts to Straw or whatever.

2010
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:17,350
A better comparison while we were at
talking about those Foxconn employees as

2011
01:23:17,351 --> 01:23:20,410
folks that work and make i-phones well,
oh,

2012
01:23:20,590 --> 01:23:22,060
the jump off the roof so much.
They have,

2013
01:23:22,830 --> 01:23:26,020
yeah.
Those people were stuck in terrible

2014
01:23:26,021 --> 01:23:28,630
jobs.
Tell me that when you read a history

2015
01:23:28,631 --> 01:23:32,350
book a thousand years from now and they
talk about what kind of barbarians we

2016
01:23:32,351 --> 01:23:35,950
are at 2017 they will start to talk
about the rise of the machine.

2017
01:23:35,980 --> 01:23:38,110
Oh,
it was talking about the cell phone and

2018
01:23:38,111 --> 01:23:41,470
they would like the people covered it,
the cell phone so much that they,

2019
01:23:41,590 --> 01:23:45,520
they found a way to compartmentalize
their ideas about slave labor to the

2020
01:23:45,521 --> 01:23:50,080
point where these people work 16 hours a
day in a gigantic concrete structure

2021
01:23:50,081 --> 01:23:53,380
making their beloved phones and they
hated the job so much and they jumped

2022
01:23:53,381 --> 01:23:54,280
off the building so much.

2023
01:23:54,460 --> 01:23:59,460
They put nets around the building but
the people kept buying phones but,

2024
01:24:00,211 --> 01:24:02,290
but didn't they have enough phones are
ready?

2025
01:24:02,291 --> 01:24:03,580
They did.
They did.

2026
01:24:03,670 --> 01:24:06,070
They didn't care.
They wanted new phones,

2027
01:24:06,220 --> 01:24:08,120
new phones.
Hi Amar.

2028
01:24:08,170 --> 01:24:13,170
Jumpers for features that the saints,
isn't that what the pyramids maybe

2029
01:24:15,730 --> 01:24:20,730
potentially created by slave labor and
they were worshiped things for ideally

2030
01:24:20,831 --> 01:24:24,520
like a religion.
I think they used to think it was slave

2031
01:24:24,521 --> 01:24:25,750
labor.
I don't know for sure.

2032
01:24:25,910 --> 01:24:28,150
Yeah.
But I think they don't think that now.

2033
01:24:28,180 --> 01:24:32,440
Now think the most recent theory is that
they were very skilled workers because

2034
01:24:32,441 --> 01:24:34,300
of the food that they got.
Yeah.

2035
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:37,740
They were almost like praise because of
what they could do.

2036
01:24:37,750 --> 01:24:40,270
Go back to the ancient Greece or ancient
Rome and they're giant,

2037
01:24:40,330 --> 01:24:42,880
uh,
places of worship,

2038
01:24:42,881 --> 01:24:44,110
their gods and whatnot.
I'm sure

2039
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,680
you're right.
But here's the thing,

2040
01:24:47,681 --> 01:24:49,750
like those things were like really like
art.

2041
01:24:50,110 --> 01:24:53,680
I think we look at buildings a little
bit different when we think about like

2042
01:24:53,681 --> 01:24:55,510
someone being forced to build something.
Yeah.

2043
01:24:55,630 --> 01:24:59,530
We think of the person who's being
forced to build it as being like a low

2044
01:24:59,531 --> 01:25:02,620
paid worker.
Whereas in those environments,

2045
01:25:02,650 --> 01:25:04,780
that person might've been a goddamn
superstar,

2046
01:25:05,110 --> 01:25:07,810
like a guy who could build a marble
because coliseum,

2047
01:25:07,990 --> 01:25:10,900
you know guys who build,
built in those pillars bit people who

2048
01:25:10,901 --> 01:25:14,950
are figuring out how to stack these
gigantic stones perfectly on top of each

2049
01:25:14,951 --> 01:25:18,100
other and make stone pillars.
How the fuck did they figure that out?

2050
01:25:19,100 --> 01:25:22,240
Got The smart guy wasn't lifting it.
He was telling all the rest of the guys,

2051
01:25:23,050 --> 01:25:26,110
maybe yes,
but maybe they were all together.

2052
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:30,340
I think more likely you had a lot of
smart people and then you had a few like

2053
01:25:30,341 --> 01:25:34,450
Leonardo da Vinci's who were fucking
super geniuses who had figured out a

2054
01:25:34,451 --> 01:25:37,730
bunch of crazy shit and was designing
things and drawing things and these,

2055
01:25:37,731 --> 01:25:42,731
these people were just like these rare
blips of like super power creativity

2056
01:25:43,300 --> 01:25:46,120
that exists all throughout history and
they propel us forward.

2057
01:25:46,180 --> 01:25:47,260
Yeah,
like a who?

2058
01:25:47,261 --> 01:25:49,240
I think it would be jobs then.
Yeah,

2059
01:25:49,420 --> 01:25:51,220
sure.
He's one of those kinds of guys.

2060
01:25:51,221 --> 01:25:52,400
Yeah.
Yeah.

2061
01:25:52,630 --> 01:25:54,310
Davinci.
I remember which artist it was,

2062
01:25:54,311 --> 01:25:57,520
but they had a,
they would make all these ideas and

2063
01:25:57,521 --> 01:26:01,780
they'd have like their understudies or
people that were almost as skilled as

2064
01:26:01,781 --> 01:26:03,450
them do these things and them.
Yeah.

2065
01:26:03,490 --> 01:26:04,310
Yeah.

2066
01:26:04,310 --> 01:26:06,020
I mean I think that's what happened with
the pyramids and stuff.

2067
01:26:06,021 --> 01:26:07,430
They probably had these people that are
planning,

2068
01:26:07,431 --> 01:26:09,740
but you also still need skilled workers
to build these.

2069
01:26:10,010 --> 01:26:12,500
Yeah,
I think will particularly something like

2070
01:26:12,501 --> 01:26:14,900
the pyramids.
There's a tremendous amount of math

2071
01:26:14,901 --> 01:26:17,900
involved and they're all doing this
somehow or another.

2072
01:26:18,050 --> 01:26:20,210
When they didn't even have steel?
No,

2073
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:25,240
they supposedly had copper tools and
they figured out some way to grind these

2074
01:26:25,281 --> 01:26:28,190
stones so perfectly.
They just sit on top of each other.

2075
01:26:28,460 --> 01:26:33,460
Just completely flat level,
barely stick a card in the crease up to

2076
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:37,780
stuff on the foxconn factories.
I remembered the said the reason why are

2077
01:26:37,781 --> 01:26:40,400
they at least that was their argument
why they weren't in America's,

2078
01:26:40,401 --> 01:26:44,170
because they had upwards of like 30,000
mechanical engineers and electronical

2079
01:26:44,180 --> 01:26:47,750
engineers at the ready.
So those would be your skilled workers

2080
01:26:48,260 --> 01:26:48,990
right in the store.

2081
01:26:48,990 --> 01:26:52,220
Slave labors underneath them,
but those are the extra people that

2082
01:26:52,250 --> 01:26:53,540
maybe that's why it's not happening.
Yeah,

2083
01:26:53,541 --> 01:26:56,150
that makes sense.
Because I guess with something like that

2084
01:26:56,151 --> 01:26:59,540
where the demand is so high and the
quality of the standard so high,

2085
01:26:59,541 --> 01:27:02,270
like I phones think,
say what you want about iphones.

2086
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:04,850
I've dropped this fucking stupid think
seven or eight times.

2087
01:27:04,851 --> 01:27:06,590
It works great.
You know,

2088
01:27:06,650 --> 01:27:09,200
I love this thing to death.
They can take a beating man.

2089
01:27:09,230 --> 01:27:11,750
It's crazy.
They can take a fucking beating.

2090
01:27:12,680 --> 01:27:14,930
These things are weird.
When these things take over.

2091
01:27:14,931 --> 01:27:17,060
I think it's going to be an apple robot
that takes,

2092
01:27:17,690 --> 01:27:20,330
I'm resisting that watch,
but it's looking tempting and it tells

2093
01:27:20,331 --> 01:27:23,390
you your heart rate.
I bought my girlfriend one and she loves

2094
01:27:23,391 --> 01:27:26,130
it and I just,
I don't want to be at home.

2095
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:28,500
Phones are going to be great.
The new iphone is going to be cool.

2096
01:27:28,550 --> 01:27:30,920
They announce it soon.
God dammit stop.

2097
01:27:31,190 --> 01:27:34,640
They can't stop.
Get back on Yo.

2098
01:27:34,670 --> 01:27:35,690
What up?
Guilty.

2099
01:27:36,140 --> 01:27:38,540
That machine,
you know,

2100
01:27:38,620 --> 01:27:41,630
just people are having romances
connected to each other,

2101
01:27:41,631 --> 01:27:43,040
looking at each other through glass,
weather,

2102
01:27:43,041 --> 01:27:46,040
wearing goggles and making phones.
That's the only socialize and get to do.

2103
01:27:46,700 --> 01:27:49,640
Do you think we might have a bounce back
moment where it rebounds a little bit

2104
01:27:49,670 --> 01:27:52,520
and a Mumford and sons take over?
Not like that,

2105
01:27:52,521 --> 01:27:55,400
but like there might be a day where we
see like,

2106
01:27:55,430 --> 01:27:58,880
you know if
we can stop it,

2107
01:27:58,881 --> 01:28:01,250
but like we need to stop all of our jobs
from being taken.

2108
01:28:01,251 --> 01:28:04,940
We're fucked.
We're already this drinking out of Mason

2109
01:28:04,940 --> 01:28:07,250
Jars and wearing fucking suede boots.
That shit.

2110
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:09,160
You just resisting the inevitable.
Sorry.

2111
01:28:10,460 --> 01:28:13,550
All in the woods.
You're on the porch with a fiddle with

2112
01:28:13,551 --> 01:28:16,180
your friends,
non ironically singing together and

2113
01:28:16,190 --> 01:28:18,170
perfect tune.
How dare you.

2114
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:21,380
If you're not going to stop the rock,
it's headed this way,

2115
01:28:22,490 --> 01:28:26,660
that music by going how many thousand
feet to be figured out.

2116
01:28:26,661 --> 01:28:31,040
10 miles a second.
Oh Jesus Christ.

2117
01:28:31,041 --> 01:28:34,490
I can't even comprehend how fast that is
that it makes my whole body hurt.

2118
01:28:35,140 --> 01:28:36,200
Just hear it.
Just hearing that.

2119
01:28:36,230 --> 01:28:38,350
I just like go limp.
Like Ooh.

2120
01:28:39,050 --> 01:28:43,400
Oh,
I remember I was living in San Jose when

2121
01:28:43,401 --> 01:28:46,700
I found out.
I remember it was like really great

2122
01:28:46,701 --> 01:28:49,520
science teacher and he would just blow
my mind all the time and I remember

2123
01:28:49,550 --> 01:28:52,610
listening to him and he was talking
about how when you look at stars,

2124
01:28:52,611 --> 01:28:56,510
you're actually looking in the past
technically because it's been,

2125
01:28:56,540 --> 01:28:59,930
because the light's just hitting us.
It's taking so long to travel.

2126
01:29:00,140 --> 01:29:01,800
This is something that's happened a long
time ago.

2127
01:29:01,850 --> 01:29:02,683
Yeah.
Yeah.

2128
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:05,730
When they look deeper and deeper into
the University of literally looking into

2129
01:29:05,731 --> 01:29:06,660
like a time machine.

2130
01:29:06,690 --> 01:29:09,170
Yeah.
So sane or my mind.

2131
01:29:09,530 --> 01:29:10,440
Great.
It's just hard.

2132
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:13,880
It's hard for your stupid little head to
figure out what these people figured

2133
01:29:13,890 --> 01:29:15,210
out,
how they all had to agree on it.

2134
01:29:15,211 --> 01:29:17,580
Okay.
I know this is gonna sound crazy,

2135
01:29:18,140 --> 01:29:21,360
but what I'm thinking is when we're
looking at those stars,

2136
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:24,390
we're looking back in time like that's
what I was going to say,

2137
01:29:24,391 --> 01:29:26,000
but I sound too crazy.
Okay.

2138
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:28,080
Are we right?
Let's look at this.

2139
01:29:28,081 --> 01:29:28,880
Let's look at this.
Neat.

2140
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:31,860
Get the pads out and start calculating,
calculating it and like,

2141
01:29:31,861 --> 01:29:32,521
okay,
do we,

2142
01:29:32,521 --> 01:29:34,500
when do we go public with us?
Um,

2143
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:35,510
I think we're good.
I think

2144
01:29:35,850 --> 01:29:40,850
then we have discovered that the earth
is 4.7 billion years old and people just

2145
01:29:45,450 --> 01:29:48,330
telling us these calculations,
like we're waking up in the middle of

2146
01:29:48,331 --> 01:29:50,400
this trip.
It's like we are literally on a

2147
01:29:50,420 --> 01:29:54,330
spaceship and the spaceship is hurling
towards somewhere and in the middle of

2148
01:29:54,331 --> 01:29:56,640
this waking up,
we have to learn how to speak.

2149
01:29:56,970 --> 01:30:01,170
We have to learn how to remember to
write things down that we've already

2150
01:30:01,171 --> 01:30:04,020
figured out.
We have to be able to save those things,

2151
01:30:04,170 --> 01:30:06,450
send them down to the next people so
they don't have to figure it out on

2152
01:30:06,451 --> 01:30:07,830
their own.
And then the next people,

2153
01:30:07,831 --> 01:30:09,210
the next people that everybody worked
together.

2154
01:30:09,330 --> 01:30:12,000
And while this is happening,
you're waking up in the middle of a

2155
01:30:12,040 --> 01:30:15,390
spaceship and it's flying.
It's like a Scifi movie.

2156
01:30:15,420 --> 01:30:17,410
It is a Scifi movie.
I mean,

2157
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:19,260
we did.
It literally is what's happening.

2158
01:30:19,740 --> 01:30:23,100
Think about how much information has
been lost throughout time.

2159
01:30:23,790 --> 01:30:24,570
Yeah,
right.

2160
01:30:24,570 --> 01:30:26,760
Like the pyramids.
That's a perfect example.

2161
01:30:26,970 --> 01:30:29,580
The Great Pyramid of Giza.
If you look at all those insane

2162
01:30:29,581 --> 01:30:31,530
photographs,
when they do those three days,

2163
01:30:31,531 --> 01:30:33,320
when they go over it,
you know,

2164
01:30:33,321 --> 01:30:36,060
with a,
with a drone and film it and you just

2165
01:30:36,061 --> 01:30:36,710
look at it,
you go this,

2166
01:30:36,710 --> 01:30:41,710
that is an insane accomplishment.
Like I can't imagine what it feels like

2167
01:30:42,300 --> 01:30:43,890
to be there in real life for wish

2168
01:30:43,900 --> 01:30:46,820
it wasn't such a sketchy part of the
world right now.

2169
01:30:47,110 --> 01:30:48,580
I would like to go over there.
I mean,

2170
01:30:48,581 --> 01:30:49,730
I'll be fine.
I just gotta go to the beard,

2171
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:51,190
had a little bit longer and be quiet.
Dude,

2172
01:30:51,191 --> 01:30:52,960
you had slipped right in.
Have a nice one.

2173
01:30:52,961 --> 01:30:56,560
Then the little hats,
white hats with the lingerie style.

2174
01:30:57,130 --> 01:30:59,200
I wouldn't get back in,
but I would totally,

2175
01:30:59,260 --> 01:31:01,750
totally building shell whip right in
Bro.

2176
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:05,410
No problem man.
Let that hair gets a little bit scraggly

2177
01:31:05,411 --> 01:31:07,300
or in your beard.
You're good.

2178
01:31:07,450 --> 01:31:08,261
Yeah man.
You know,

2179
01:31:08,261 --> 01:31:09,730
and just talk like you got a sore
throat.

2180
01:31:12,260 --> 01:31:15,460
So
that's one of the jokes that I'm doing

2181
01:31:15,461 --> 01:31:16,930
now that I add,
really had fun with,

2182
01:31:16,931 --> 01:31:20,590
which is like the idea of me getting
deported and going back to Mexico and

2183
01:31:20,591 --> 01:31:23,260
having just to be quiet the whole time
because he can't speak Spanish.

2184
01:31:23,261 --> 01:31:25,630
I can't speak Spanish and they can't
like let them know,

2185
01:31:25,960 --> 01:31:29,830
does that piss off some Mexicans,
some Mexican Americans that you can't

2186
01:31:29,831 --> 01:31:33,130
speak Spanish in San Jose did a little
bit grown up some,

2187
01:31:33,190 --> 01:31:35,650
well older Mexicans cause it's like they
look at me and they're just like,

2188
01:31:35,680 --> 01:31:36,880
Oh God,
what have we done?

2189
01:31:36,940 --> 01:31:39,070
You know what I mean?
Like at what cost is our freedom and our

2190
01:31:39,071 --> 01:31:41,080
dreams.
But it's,

2191
01:31:41,380 --> 01:31:42,310
it's kind of,
well,

2192
01:31:42,370 --> 01:31:46,420
I didn't learn because there was a
moment for my grandparents and my mom,

2193
01:31:46,421 --> 01:31:47,440
my dad,
where it was like,

2194
01:31:47,441 --> 01:31:50,140
we don't want him to,
we don't want people to know he's,

2195
01:31:50,190 --> 01:31:51,520
you know,
Hispanic like,

2196
01:31:51,521 --> 01:31:52,930
cause it was like almost looked down
upon that.

2197
01:31:52,931 --> 01:31:55,390
He's like,
you're speaking Spanish and bright,

2198
01:31:55,540 --> 01:31:57,100
you have to speak English,
Blah Blah.

2199
01:31:57,460 --> 01:32:01,420
But now it's the point where it's like,
it's much of a benefit to learn multiple

2200
01:32:01,421 --> 01:32:02,680
languages.
Well,

2201
01:32:02,681 --> 01:32:06,130
I would think if you're a guy who could
speak Spanish,

2202
01:32:06,131 --> 01:32:09,410
you could work in all sorts of different
countries and South America too.

2203
01:32:09,450 --> 01:32:10,510
Yeah.
You know,

2204
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:22,000
we just had a serious leak,
ladies and gentlemen.

2205
01:32:22,240 --> 01:32:23,230
Oh,
Larry's,

2206
01:32:24,970 --> 01:32:25,803
it's in the ceiling.

2207
01:32:25,860 --> 01:32:28,110
Yeah,
we had a serious leak in our building.

2208
01:32:28,111 --> 01:32:31,500
It's fucking raining cats and dogs out
there.

2209
01:32:31,530 --> 01:32:32,610
Megan.
This building wet,

2210
01:32:32,760 --> 01:32:34,710
uh,
we in trouble.

2211
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:36,020
Oh No,
we're,

2212
01:32:36,030 --> 01:32:36,960
it depends where it is.

2213
01:32:37,350 --> 01:32:38,890
What if it hits electricity?
You're saying,

2214
01:32:38,900 --> 01:32:40,710
I don't know.
Should we get the fuck Outta here?

2215
01:32:40,740 --> 01:32:42,460
I don't know.
Holy Shit.

2216
01:32:42,461 --> 01:32:45,330
I told you I'm not good with electricity
once a day full of,

2217
01:32:45,331 --> 01:32:46,920
uh,
whatever.

2218
01:32:47,010 --> 01:32:48,170
Well,
whatever happened,

2219
01:32:48,180 --> 01:32:50,610
it seems to me like water pooled up
somewhere and then,

2220
01:32:50,611 --> 01:32:53,100
then the least.
It sounds like it's right above us on

2221
01:32:53,101 --> 01:32:54,900
that.
I don't know where,

2222
01:32:54,901 --> 01:32:57,870
if there's electronic wires up there or
whatnot or how it could it came in or

2223
01:32:57,871 --> 01:33:01,640
what could probably look the drama.
Can I be a great credit just to,

2224
01:33:01,641 --> 01:33:04,620
it was like to die on Joe Rogan's
podcast do don't die.

2225
01:33:04,700 --> 01:33:07,980
Oh well this,
we can avoid this disaster again.

2226
01:33:08,780 --> 01:33:11,990
The Sky is letting us know probably up
until we have no control.

2227
01:33:12,010 --> 01:33:14,700
The future and the university is like,
you guys gotta stop talking about

2228
01:33:14,701 --> 01:33:17,280
asteroids because it's close.
Universities like,

2229
01:33:17,281 --> 01:33:18,850
listen bitch,
she got your own problems to worry.

2230
01:33:18,860 --> 01:33:19,480
Yeah.

2231
01:33:19,480 --> 01:33:23,560
Well just fucking water from the sky.
Uh,

2232
01:33:23,740 --> 01:33:25,070
there's all a talker.

2233
01:33:26,100 --> 01:33:28,680
Some Mexicans or mullah more Mexicans
are cool.

2234
01:33:28,681 --> 01:33:30,840
Then now when they meet me,
cause they're just like the proud.

2235
01:33:30,841 --> 01:33:32,880
It's a sense of pride and like a lot of
magazines.

2236
01:33:32,881 --> 01:33:35,370
San Jose hit me up like a lot of young
kids after I won,

2237
01:33:35,580 --> 01:33:36,361
like hit me,
I'm there like,

2238
01:33:36,361 --> 01:33:36,970
yeah,
fuck you,

2239
01:33:36,970 --> 01:33:37,950
San Jose,
blah blah.

2240
01:33:38,310 --> 01:33:39,001
And they're like,
you know,

2241
01:33:39,001 --> 01:33:41,400
I want to do stand up.
And they asked me for advice and you

2242
01:33:41,401 --> 01:33:43,530
know it's towel man.
Just do Mike's and shit.

2243
01:33:43,860 --> 01:33:44,651
Yeah,
no you,

2244
01:33:44,651 --> 01:33:46,500
you,
you're in a great position right now as

2245
01:33:46,501 --> 01:33:48,180
being a guy who successful and,
oh,

2246
01:33:48,181 --> 01:33:50,460
Jamie's going to go look.
You got your rubber gloves.

2247
01:33:50,670 --> 01:33:51,540
No,
I'm just going to like,

2248
01:33:54,130 --> 01:33:57,840
oh,
we got a serious situation here ladies

2249
01:33:57,841 --> 01:33:58,674
and gentlemen.
Okay.

2250
01:34:00,130 --> 01:34:01,240
Just read by a light.

2251
01:34:01,540 --> 01:34:02,830
Okay.
It's not good.

2252
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:08,000
It's not good.
[inaudible] want to shut that light off.

2253
01:34:08,460 --> 01:34:09,890
Can I set all the lights off?
No,

2254
01:34:09,891 --> 01:34:12,110
don't do that.
You don't want to talk in the dark?

2255
01:34:12,260 --> 01:34:16,220
Let's just see what happens.
I feel good about this.

2256
01:34:16,290 --> 01:34:17,420
I need to,
you know,

2257
01:34:17,910 --> 01:34:18,743
just a leak.

2258
01:34:21,360 --> 01:34:26,360
Just the water pouring down on us.
So they're evacuating parts of northern

2259
01:34:26,491 --> 01:34:27,390
California.
Correct.

2260
01:34:27,391 --> 01:34:28,770
I think that was,
I got to,

2261
01:34:28,830 --> 01:34:30,990
I think it was notification in case
there's road.

2262
01:34:31,130 --> 01:34:32,580
It's probably because we're near the,
some of the hills.

2263
01:34:32,581 --> 01:34:34,680
There's case to,
you're an area where your roads get me

2264
01:34:34,681 --> 01:34:36,830
any closer to the one slide,
where to go be,

2265
01:34:36,831 --> 01:34:38,890
be ready to leave in case you have to or
something.

2266
01:34:39,050 --> 01:34:42,870
I went down Laurel and there was a house
that fell off the side of the cliff.

2267
01:34:43,020 --> 01:34:46,340
That's that driving,
driving and watching,

2268
01:34:46,350 --> 01:34:48,150
like looking at those houses.
Just it's,

2269
01:34:48,180 --> 01:34:49,510
I get anxiety.
Yeah.

2270
01:34:49,530 --> 01:34:53,040
Just watching those houses.
They had a giant back porch and it just

2271
01:34:53,041 --> 01:34:55,140
broke off and slid down the side of the
hill.

2272
01:34:55,390 --> 01:34:58,160
I imagine just being that guy that made
so much money

2273
01:34:58,160 --> 01:35:00,530
that you were like,
finally I get to enjoy my porch.

2274
01:35:00,531 --> 01:35:03,440
It's raining.
I get to look at all the Hollywood hills

2275
01:35:03,441 --> 01:35:04,910
have worked so hard.
And then it's just like,

2276
01:35:05,690 --> 01:35:07,820
dude,
that's like a life changing disaster

2277
01:35:08,210 --> 01:35:10,070
when your house breaks and slides down a
hill,

2278
01:35:10,340 --> 01:35:13,400
that will change your fucking life.
There was a whole house that's slid down

2279
01:35:13,401 --> 01:35:14,690
the hill.
You hear it again,

2280
01:35:14,780 --> 01:35:15,613
Jamie?

2281
01:35:16,710 --> 01:35:17,910
Ooh.
It's coming down hard.

2282
01:35:18,150 --> 01:35:18,980
Hit outside.
I don't hear it.

2283
01:35:18,980 --> 01:35:20,180
Oh,
I heard like another,

2284
01:35:20,970 --> 01:35:22,590
there's a couple of drips with him.
They stop.

2285
01:35:22,860 --> 01:35:25,530
Um,
what were just talking about?

2286
01:35:25,940 --> 01:35:27,040
Um,
so big mudslide.

2287
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:29,070
Oh,
a house on?

2288
01:35:29,071 --> 01:35:29,904
Um,
uh,

2289
01:35:30,330 --> 01:35:32,280
was it on Topanga?
No,

2290
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:34,890
it was on,
Laurel was on Laurel coming up over

2291
01:35:34,891 --> 01:35:37,260
Laurel Canyon.
I don't know if you were here like four

2292
01:35:37,261 --> 01:35:40,650
or five years ago.
There was a house that's slid off the

2293
01:35:40,651 --> 01:35:42,090
side of the hill.
Wow.

2294
01:35:42,120 --> 01:35:44,190
And you could drive by it.
You see the house.

2295
01:35:44,191 --> 01:35:46,020
Like it wasn't like that much of a hill
either.

2296
01:35:46,021 --> 01:35:47,070
I mean,
you know,

2297
01:35:47,670 --> 01:35:50,370
it's decent,
but whatever was behind it was the

2298
01:35:50,371 --> 01:35:53,340
problem.
It like kind of pushed it forward like

2299
01:35:53,341 --> 01:35:53,730
the,
the,

2300
01:35:53,730 --> 01:35:56,760
the ground broke loose above it and
pushed it forward and there was like a

2301
01:35:56,761 --> 01:36:00,450
big ass lawsuit and lasted forever.
But I would always drive by looking at

2302
01:36:00,451 --> 01:36:02,100
that place going,
this is,

2303
01:36:02,970 --> 01:36:05,310
this is supposed to happen like that.
It's like the earth.

2304
01:36:05,340 --> 01:36:06,570
It just shifts constantly.

2305
01:36:06,750 --> 01:36:09,000
Like our idea that we could just pitch a
tent forever.

2306
01:36:09,360 --> 01:36:11,010
That'd be fine.
It's fucking ridiculous.

2307
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:12,180
Earth's crust,
not that deep.

2308
01:36:12,181 --> 01:36:14,610
Right.
Not deep enough for my tastes.

2309
01:36:14,611 --> 01:36:15,444
Exactly.
You know what I mean?

2310
01:36:15,580 --> 01:36:18,090
I just laugh at the bottom of it.
I think it's,

2311
01:36:18,091 --> 01:36:19,260
I,
I'm probably gonna say something real

2312
01:36:19,261 --> 01:36:20,730
stupid Ligo.
It's like seven miles deep,

2313
01:36:20,731 --> 01:36:22,740
but I feel like it's not that deep.
Yeah.

2314
01:36:22,741 --> 01:36:24,150
I don't think it's that much more than
that.

2315
01:36:24,180 --> 01:36:25,980
I know there was a,
this mining operation,

2316
01:36:25,981 --> 01:36:27,930
I'd like to find out what the exact
number is.

2317
01:36:28,170 --> 01:36:30,750
There was some mining operation,
um,

2318
01:36:30,840 --> 01:36:31,530
that,
uh,

2319
01:36:31,530 --> 01:36:34,680
they were doing this article about how
many miles is it Jamie?

2320
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:36,030
Sorry,
what's that?

2321
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:37,770
Okay.

2322
01:36:37,770 --> 01:36:39,720
Crust average.
Yeah,

2323
01:36:39,870 --> 01:36:41,540
necessarily.
Initially I had the radius,

2324
01:36:41,550 --> 01:36:43,620
it sits about 4,000 miles,
but that's the radius.

2325
01:36:43,621 --> 01:36:47,250
So it's a average is about 18 miles
under the continents,

2326
01:36:47,251 --> 01:36:49,020
but it's only about three miles under
the ocean.

2327
01:36:50,570 --> 01:36:52,850
Whoa.
That's only about three miles out of the

2328
01:36:52,851 --> 01:36:56,330
ocean and then lava.
That's how like Hawaii gets brought up.

2329
01:36:56,540 --> 01:36:58,970
God Damn.
I don't think that's deemed enough for

2330
01:36:58,971 --> 01:37:00,260
me.
That seems weird.

2331
01:37:02,160 --> 01:37:04,880
We're like,
there's a ball of live under our feet.

2332
01:37:06,590 --> 01:37:09,140
Jesus Christ,
yet we're just the crust over the sun.

2333
01:37:09,860 --> 01:37:10,693
Yeah,
man,

2334
01:37:10,910 --> 01:37:12,740
that's not good.
Yeah.

2335
01:37:12,930 --> 01:37:13,430
There was,
uh,

2336
01:37:13,430 --> 01:37:16,250
some article I was saying that,
that I read about a mining operation

2337
01:37:16,520 --> 01:37:18,890
where they were talking about how warm
it got.

2338
01:37:19,340 --> 01:37:22,490
As you got lower and lower,
deeper and deeper into the earth,

2339
01:37:22,491 --> 01:37:26,160
that you could literally feel the heat
of the fucking lava.

2340
01:37:26,210 --> 01:37:28,790
These assholes are drilling next to how
quick,

2341
01:37:28,791 --> 01:37:29,930
dude,
you hit wrong one.

2342
01:37:30,160 --> 01:37:31,340
Oh God.
You hit wrong.

2343
01:37:32,030 --> 01:37:35,050
You can't even speak yet one wrong vein.
Yeah.

2344
01:37:35,120 --> 01:37:36,530
Oh,
that's terrifying.

2345
01:37:36,830 --> 01:37:38,630
I wonder if they have that down to a
science.

2346
01:37:38,631 --> 01:37:41,000
Obviously they do,
but do they know exactly that?

2347
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:44,840
They're never going to like drill a hole
into the lava and have it spew out

2348
01:37:44,841 --> 01:37:47,570
through the top like a Zit.
This gotta be mistakes had been made.

2349
01:37:47,780 --> 01:37:50,530
Did you imagine if that happened?
Can you imagine if these guys really

2350
01:37:50,540 --> 01:37:53,420
trying to get more diamonds like work
this more diamonds there?

2351
01:37:53,421 --> 01:37:54,920
But here's the deal.
Oh foot.

2352
01:37:55,230 --> 01:37:57,150
The diamonds is the center of the
fucking earth.

2353
01:37:57,510 --> 01:38:01,320
So don't drill two going to have to wear
space suits that won't allow you to use

2354
01:38:01,321 --> 01:38:04,290
your hands.
Say everything's going to be done in a

2355
01:38:04,291 --> 01:38:06,390
key pad.
You're going to have to ipad strapped to

2356
01:38:06,391 --> 01:38:08,400
you and you're going to have to program
it like this.

2357
01:38:09,090 --> 01:38:13,380
And they'll try to suck the last diamond
out and then they'll see the bubble of

2358
01:38:13,381 --> 01:38:17,610
red with that last diamond hole was,
and then that's the last thing they say

2359
01:38:17,611 --> 01:38:19,050
is the explosion.

2360
01:38:19,050 --> 01:38:23,010
As that hot lava shoots passed,
I'm like a broken fire hydrant.

2361
01:38:23,400 --> 01:38:26,100
She goes boom,
and right out of the surface of the

2362
01:38:26,101 --> 01:38:31,101
earth just sprays lava into the sky.
This for years and years,

2363
01:38:33,140 --> 01:38:35,570
that's probably one check was just like,
I want that time.

2364
01:38:36,450 --> 01:38:40,560
How big that's the diamond and killed
everybody and I need it for you to show

2365
01:38:40,561 --> 01:38:44,010
me about mate.
There's a person like that out there,

2366
01:38:44,040 --> 01:38:44,940
you know there are,
oh,

2367
01:38:44,941 --> 01:38:46,590
I have,
don't get mad people.

2368
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:51,040
Sexual stereotypes are disgusting.
And I'm looking at diamonds,

2369
01:38:52,020 --> 01:38:55,200
actually not diamonds,
but an emerald dude.

2370
01:38:55,290 --> 01:38:57,890
Engagement rings or brutality.
Oh my God,

2371
01:38:57,900 --> 01:38:59,550
no.
Those goddamn things aren't even worth

2372
01:38:59,551 --> 01:39:00,420
anything.
Yeah,

2373
01:39:00,440 --> 01:39:03,900
there are definitely people buy it,
but the reason why people buy it for so

2374
01:39:03,901 --> 01:39:05,580
much,
it's because they've stockpile always

2375
01:39:05,581 --> 01:39:07,350
fucking diamonds and they control the
price.

2376
01:39:07,380 --> 01:39:08,041
Yeah,
exactly.

2377
01:39:08,041 --> 01:39:09,750
It's amazing.
It's so smart.

2378
01:39:09,890 --> 01:39:14,890
And we kind of give it up for the Jews,
but up strong marketing strategy when it

2379
01:39:16,150 --> 01:39:16,531
cut,
is it,

2380
01:39:16,531 --> 01:39:20,040
are they the Jews that run the diamonds?
It's not a bad thing to say.

2381
01:39:20,041 --> 01:39:22,920
People would say that that's racist.
I will tell you it's not racist.

2382
01:39:22,950 --> 01:39:25,530
If it's a positive quality,
they're awesome at business.

2383
01:39:26,600 --> 01:39:29,550
How is that racist?
Why was everybody so sensitive that you

2384
01:39:29,551 --> 01:39:33,630
can't even say something?
Jay Ingest about a person's positive

2385
01:39:33,631 --> 01:39:35,830
attributes.
Now when people think you're racist,

2386
01:39:35,880 --> 01:39:38,340
Mike,
the Jews are good about business.

2387
01:39:38,580 --> 01:39:39,780
What?
That's a good thing.

2388
01:39:39,810 --> 01:39:41,160
It's good thing to be good with
business.

2389
01:39:41,161 --> 01:39:43,800
You fuckhead my uncle,
when I told him I had an agent,

2390
01:39:43,830 --> 01:39:45,630
he was just like,
I have one piece of advice to give you.

2391
01:39:45,631 --> 01:39:47,130
And he was like,
he was like,

2392
01:39:47,131 --> 01:39:47,911
what?
He was like,

2393
01:39:47,911 --> 01:39:48,870
what kind of manager you have?
I was like,

2394
01:39:48,930 --> 01:39:49,780
oh,
he's like a,

2395
01:39:49,800 --> 01:39:50,090
it's what?

2396
01:39:50,090 --> 01:39:51,110
This company was like,
no,

2397
01:39:51,111 --> 01:39:53,130
I don't like what you know.
And I was like,

2398
01:39:53,250 --> 01:39:54,180
oh,
he's Jewish.

2399
01:39:54,181 --> 01:39:55,440
And he was like,
good job.

2400
01:39:55,950 --> 01:39:57,030
That's a good move.
And I was like,

2401
01:39:57,031 --> 01:39:57,751
what?
No,

2402
01:39:57,751 --> 01:39:58,381
no,
the business.

2403
01:39:58,381 --> 01:39:58,981
And that was,
yeah,

2404
01:39:58,981 --> 01:40:00,420
that was all he said to me and I was
like,

2405
01:40:00,421 --> 01:40:02,370
that's the weirdest thing.
It was so funny to me.

2406
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:07,260
It's a weird thing the Jewish folks
because um,

2407
01:40:07,620 --> 01:40:11,550
especially like European Jews is more
Nobel prize winning new Europe,

2408
01:40:11,580 --> 01:40:15,790
European,
European Jews that I think anybody truly

2409
01:40:15,810 --> 01:40:17,160
weird.
Like there's a,

2410
01:40:17,161 --> 01:40:21,170
there's a pillar of,
of science or just a,

2411
01:40:21,180 --> 01:40:26,180
a pillar of pillars on a good word,
a collective of incredible minds that

2412
01:40:26,431 --> 01:40:29,040
have come out of European Jews for some
strange reason.

2413
01:40:29,220 --> 01:40:32,160
I feel like they're all hilarious to
European Jews.

2414
01:40:32,820 --> 01:40:34,890
Really?
Like name one.

2415
01:40:35,070 --> 01:40:36,270
No,
what are you saying?

2416
01:40:36,540 --> 01:40:37,051
Oh,
why?

2417
01:40:37,051 --> 01:40:37,710
I was just saying,
oh,

2418
01:40:37,710 --> 01:40:38,700
just sell.
Taught

2419
01:40:41,320 --> 01:40:41,761
going.
Huh?

2420
01:40:41,761 --> 01:40:42,594
You one of those,
keep going.

2421
01:40:42,900 --> 01:40:45,960
I love smoking weed.
He don't just take the high and say this

2422
01:40:45,961 --> 01:40:46,800
is it.
I'm good.

2423
01:40:47,110 --> 01:40:48,630
No,
I write it out

2424
01:40:50,650 --> 01:40:54,130
where you big stoner got grown up or no,
not until I was 30.

2425
01:40:55,020 --> 01:40:56,030
Yeah.
What would you say,

2426
01:40:56,050 --> 01:40:56,550
Jamie?

2427
01:40:56,550 --> 01:40:59,320
You're talking about diamonds.
Have you ever seen the people that dig

2428
01:40:59,321 --> 01:41:02,380
for like diamond dust and gold dust in
the streets in New York that like,

2429
01:41:02,410 --> 01:41:04,480
ah,
I don't know exactly what street it is,

2430
01:41:04,481 --> 01:41:06,010
but you know,
there's like that area at the diamond

2431
01:41:06,011 --> 01:41:08,110
area and they're all like doing
exchanges and whatnot.

2432
01:41:08,740 --> 01:41:10,720
When they're looking at them in their
car and whatnot.

2433
01:41:10,780 --> 01:41:14,320
Dust gets on their pants and little
little flecks fall off and they get into

2434
01:41:14,321 --> 01:41:16,490
the street,
into the dust and here's like a,

2435
01:41:16,900 --> 01:41:18,130
here's a video.
There's a gut and make,

2436
01:41:18,450 --> 01:41:20,140
it's probably more people that do it now
obviously,

2437
01:41:20,141 --> 01:41:23,110
but like they just dig through the dirt
and the dust and the street cracks and

2438
01:41:23,111 --> 01:41:25,300
whatnot,
and they can take it home and they can

2439
01:41:25,301 --> 01:41:30,301
find hundreds or thousands of dollars
worth of like diamond dust and gold dust

2440
01:41:31,631 --> 01:41:34,270
and diamond flex and I'm sure
occasionally they fuck,

2441
01:41:34,271 --> 01:41:36,220
they get like really lucky and find a
whole one,

2442
01:41:36,221 --> 01:41:38,920
but they're like,
it's just based off of that.

2443
01:41:38,921 --> 01:41:41,530
That's where all of it is happening on
like that one block in New York.

2444
01:41:43,270 --> 01:41:44,390
Yeah,
old school panning yet.

2445
01:41:44,680 --> 01:41:48,110
That's insane.
They're panning for gold in front of

2446
01:41:48,111 --> 01:41:51,740
these diamonds doors,
and that's probably not they found

2447
01:41:51,741 --> 01:41:53,150
there.
But yeah,

2448
01:41:53,170 --> 01:41:55,430
I heard about this couple of years ago.
I just thought maybe you'd heard about

2449
01:41:55,431 --> 01:41:57,470
it since you not there or dude,
well,

2450
01:41:57,471 --> 01:41:59,870
I never lived in Manhattan.
I lived in new Rochelle.

2451
01:41:59,871 --> 01:42:02,930
I couldn't afford to live in Manhattan.
That's amazing though.

2452
01:42:03,890 --> 01:42:06,290
I've always wanted to move to New York.
New York's crazy,

2453
01:42:06,291 --> 01:42:09,440
but when I was living there,
I was po and I couldn't afford the

2454
01:42:09,441 --> 01:42:10,940
parking.
You have a,

2455
01:42:11,030 --> 01:42:13,310
if I would've had to get a really shitty
apartment,

2456
01:42:14,050 --> 01:42:16,160
I had my apartment.
New Rochelle is pretty shitty too,

2457
01:42:16,161 --> 01:42:19,190
but I would have had to get a parking
spot.

2458
01:42:19,280 --> 01:42:20,960
You have to pay every month.
Whoa.

2459
01:42:21,530 --> 01:42:24,020
Yeah.
You can be a lot of money to like

2460
01:42:24,020 --> 01:42:24,860
thousands of dollars.
That's insane.

2461
01:42:24,910 --> 01:42:26,700
Yes.
I mean that's as high as it could go.

2462
01:42:26,701 --> 01:42:31,040
I wonder what like a good,
what's a good monthly rate for parking

2463
01:42:31,041 --> 01:42:32,810
in a parking structure in New York City?

2464
01:42:33,380 --> 01:42:35,000
It's pretty.
I've heard comics talk about,

2465
01:42:35,001 --> 01:42:37,940
it's pretty ridiculous.
So a lot of them don't keep cars because

2466
01:42:37,941 --> 01:42:39,610
now you can just uber anywhere you want.
Yeah.

2467
01:42:39,890 --> 01:42:43,310
Take cabs and go all over the city.
But back in the day,

2468
01:42:43,340 --> 01:42:45,860
if you wanted to live there and you
wanted to do road trips,

2469
01:42:45,861 --> 01:42:47,420
you had to have a place to keep your
car.

2470
01:42:47,660 --> 01:42:50,420
And it was like insurmountable for me.
It was just,

2471
01:42:50,421 --> 01:42:53,690
there's no way.
Something like Ed my in my day,

2472
01:42:53,691 --> 01:42:57,320
I remember it being like something like
$700 a month just to park your car.

2473
01:42:57,350 --> 01:42:58,000
Wow.
Yeah.

2474
01:42:58,000 --> 01:42:58,910
And I was like,
what?

2475
01:42:58,970 --> 01:43:00,950
Even then there's just so much traffic
in New York.

2476
01:43:01,040 --> 01:43:02,960
Yeah.
And this is back when I was making like

2477
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:06,140
three 50 a week on average,
you know?

2478
01:43:06,141 --> 01:43:07,520
So it was ridiculous.

2479
01:43:07,790 --> 01:43:09,930
It's probably less than that now,
but there's different areas.

2480
01:43:09,931 --> 01:43:14,040
It looks like it's anywhere from 300
plus up to three 75 there's different

2481
01:43:14,041 --> 01:43:14,874
garages now.

2482
01:43:15,110 --> 01:43:15,770
Interesting.
Yeah.

2483
01:43:15,770 --> 01:43:18,560
So,
so you can get it as low as 300 bucks.

2484
01:43:19,350 --> 01:43:22,490
Find some that say two 50 what's an
expensive one?

2485
01:43:24,230 --> 01:43:27,680
The ones that I saw that were cheaper,
they stack you on top of each other.

2486
01:43:27,681 --> 01:43:29,780
I don't know if you've ever seen that.
That's really nuts.

2487
01:43:30,110 --> 01:43:32,300
Yeah.
Well I remember it was 700 bucks.

2488
01:43:32,301 --> 01:43:33,710
What do you mean stack on top of each
other?

2489
01:43:33,740 --> 01:43:38,740
They stick them into these machines and
the machines lift up and then another

2490
01:43:39,260 --> 01:43:41,750
car gets driven in.
The machine continues to lift up.

2491
01:43:42,170 --> 01:43:46,700
And so like you have to drive the cars
out and then bring the thing down and

2492
01:43:46,701 --> 01:43:48,770
drive that car out and bring the thing
down.

2493
01:43:48,771 --> 01:43:50,210
And,
and you might have to do that with like

2494
01:43:50,211 --> 01:43:52,340
three or four cars at that.
Like that.

2495
01:43:52,550 --> 01:43:54,140
Yo,
that's fucking crazy.

2496
01:43:55,360 --> 01:43:58,400
That sounds terrible.
It is so crazy that they could do that.

2497
01:43:58,610 --> 01:44:02,150
So this is the way they saved space and
stack cars and it actually does work.

2498
01:44:02,151 --> 01:44:03,970
But Jesus Christ,
how weird is that?

2499
01:44:04,610 --> 01:44:06,170
They have your car up.
I mean,

2500
01:44:06,171 --> 01:44:08,480
tell me one of these guys who works
there.

2501
01:44:08,481 --> 01:44:11,450
Can't fuck up one day.
Just people.

2502
01:44:11,451 --> 01:44:13,910
Fuck yeah,
there's gotta be an accident that's

2503
01:44:13,911 --> 01:44:15,290
happening.
People fuck things up.

2504
01:44:15,500 --> 01:44:17,120
You know,
a car is fallen off that thing and

2505
01:44:17,121 --> 01:44:18,420
landed on someone's head.
Oh,

2506
01:44:18,860 --> 01:44:19,910
for sure.
Right.

2507
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:22,010
That's had to have happened.
Don't you think?

2508
01:44:24,830 --> 01:44:26,530
I've seen valet drivers.
Yeah.

2509
01:44:26,540 --> 01:44:30,680
Well maybe I was wrong about how much it
costs or maybe I had a very expensive

2510
01:44:30,681 --> 01:44:33,170
one near me and maybe it's because they
stack them.

2511
01:44:33,171 --> 01:44:36,440
They can do it for 300 bucks,
but whatever the amount was,

2512
01:44:36,441 --> 01:44:38,480
I don't remember what it was.
I didn't make any fucking money back

2513
01:44:38,481 --> 01:44:40,670
then.
So there's no way it was going to work.

2514
01:44:40,680 --> 01:44:42,320
Where are you serving back then?
Uh,

2515
01:44:42,321 --> 01:44:43,270
no.
Back then it was a,

2516
01:44:43,280 --> 01:44:45,260
that was my,
when I lived in new Rochelle is my,

2517
01:44:45,320 --> 01:44:50,320
my first attempt at living off stand up.
That was my first actual attempt where,

2518
01:44:51,620 --> 01:44:55,580
um,
before I'd always had day jobs and a day

2519
01:44:55,581 --> 01:44:59,240
job driving limos.
I had a day job delivering newspapers.

2520
01:44:59,660 --> 01:45:02,450
And so then I went from there to,
uh,

2521
01:45:02,510 --> 01:45:06,230
to New York and when I went to New York
I was just like almost making money,

2522
01:45:06,231 --> 01:45:08,810
doing stand up like almost almost like
some months.

2523
01:45:08,870 --> 01:45:10,010
Oh,
I made it this month,

2524
01:45:10,250 --> 01:45:11,011
next month,
fuck,

2525
01:45:11,011 --> 01:45:12,350
can I have any gigs?
You know,

2526
01:45:12,351 --> 01:45:14,900
it was like almost being able to pull it
off.

2527
01:45:15,470 --> 01:45:18,450
So whatever the amount for a parking and
then living in New York City.

2528
01:45:18,460 --> 01:45:21,590
Plus the thing about New York City is
New York's amazing and it's,

2529
01:45:21,850 --> 01:45:24,470
it's incredible that you can hop around
and go from club to club to club.

2530
01:45:24,890 --> 01:45:28,370
But it was harder at the time at least
to do long sets.

2531
01:45:28,440 --> 01:45:32,990
So like I wanted to do like sets that
prepare me for headlining on the road.

2532
01:45:32,991 --> 01:45:36,110
I want it to like keep doing that set
like even during the weekday.

2533
01:45:36,111 --> 01:45:38,960
So I just try to get it stronger and do
it all as a whole.

2534
01:45:39,260 --> 01:45:43,310
And that was really only available on
the road for a guy like me.

2535
01:45:43,430 --> 01:45:46,100
You know,
I feel like that's kind of where I'm at

2536
01:45:46,101 --> 01:45:47,060
now.
It's like I don't,

2537
01:45:47,810 --> 01:45:51,200
I can find this for the first month I
was ever able to pay my bills and

2538
01:45:51,201 --> 01:45:52,070
everything off his standup.

2539
01:45:52,100 --> 01:45:54,270
And that's a,
it was a great failing of the drug.

2540
01:45:54,320 --> 01:45:56,000
The launching pad.
Well,

2541
01:45:56,001 --> 01:45:57,080
I mean there's gotta be smarter about
it.

2542
01:45:57,081 --> 01:46:01,940
Cause I mean now that I have money,
that's all just going to rent so I can

2543
01:46:01,941 --> 01:46:05,660
afford to be on the road and to build
that time to where I can,

2544
01:46:05,900 --> 01:46:08,870
you know,
feature regularly and then make that

2545
01:46:08,871 --> 01:46:10,160
money.
Yeah,

2546
01:46:10,161 --> 01:46:12,620
man,
it's all right for you right now about

2547
01:46:12,621 --> 01:46:15,760
right new shit.
And I'm so excited about dose saloon

2548
01:46:15,770 --> 01:46:17,330
hustle,
Luton host saloon,

2549
01:46:17,340 --> 01:46:18,530
host saloon.
Yeah,

2550
01:46:18,531 --> 01:46:20,630
it's cool.
It's a really interesting time for you,

2551
01:46:21,080 --> 01:46:22,100
but that's gotta be that.
That's,

2552
01:46:22,101 --> 01:46:25,910
that's a great feeling though when you
to be for you too.

2553
01:46:25,911 --> 01:46:28,550
I mean that moment when you were able to
just live off,

2554
01:46:28,551 --> 01:46:29,660
stand up.
It was scary.

2555
01:46:29,990 --> 01:46:31,970
I didn't think I was going to make it.
I was bombing a lot too.

2556
01:46:32,280 --> 01:46:34,730
Yeah.
I was eating a lot of Dick every,

2557
01:46:34,790 --> 01:46:37,130
every other show,
something would go wrong.

2558
01:46:37,160 --> 01:46:39,340
I'd go down hard.
I mean,

2559
01:46:39,350 --> 01:46:41,060
and I got my girl with me.
So it's real.

2560
01:46:41,061 --> 01:46:43,490
It's,
it's when you girl sees you bomb,

2561
01:46:43,491 --> 01:46:45,140
that's rough.
Yeah,

2562
01:46:45,141 --> 01:46:50,141
it is.
She's seen me off rough on the ego.

2563
01:46:50,820 --> 01:46:53,430
But she was cool though because she has
that support system where she like,

2564
01:46:53,740 --> 01:46:54,271
she'll be like,
yeah,

2565
01:46:54,271 --> 01:46:56,520
you need to work harder.
But she knows him funny.

2566
01:46:56,550 --> 01:46:58,410
Yeah.
Right now it's finally paying off for

2567
01:46:58,411 --> 01:47:00,630
her too.
Well you can be a hard worker and not be

2568
01:47:00,631 --> 01:47:01,590
funny.
Oh yeah.

2569
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:02,680
That,
that's,

2570
01:47:02,680 --> 01:47:03,990
that's a problem.
You know,

2571
01:47:03,991 --> 01:47:08,250
it's when the person is funny and as a
hard worker,

2572
01:47:08,670 --> 01:47:09,800
you know,
that's like the tea,

2573
01:47:09,890 --> 01:47:12,960
which you'd try to maintain,
try to maintain that balance but a lot

2574
01:47:12,961 --> 01:47:15,000
of time to get either or,
you know,

2575
01:47:15,210 --> 01:47:16,380
but that's the case with everything.

2576
01:47:16,960 --> 01:47:18,100
It's driven.
Hardier man.

2577
01:47:18,340 --> 01:47:20,620
I keep hearing that behind me.
I'm scared.

2578
01:47:22,450 --> 01:47:24,010
Yeah.
It's um,

2579
01:47:24,160 --> 01:47:24,993
it's cool.
I'll dude,

2580
01:47:25,270 --> 01:47:26,103
are you enjoying it?

2581
01:47:26,360 --> 01:47:27,380
I'm loving it,
man.

2582
01:47:27,410 --> 01:47:28,760
It's fun.
I've never,

2583
01:47:28,820 --> 01:47:30,320
I mean,
do you feel,

2584
01:47:30,530 --> 01:47:34,580
do you feel certain about everything?
Do you feel anxious?

2585
01:47:34,610 --> 01:47:36,350
Like Kinda,
how do you feel about like the future

2586
01:47:36,351 --> 01:47:37,850
you feel excited?
Do you feel?

2587
01:47:37,910 --> 01:47:41,960
I feel really excited cause I don't feel
the only reason I'd feel anxious if I

2588
01:47:41,961 --> 01:47:44,240
knew that I couldn't do it right now.
It's like,

2589
01:47:44,840 --> 01:47:46,490
for me it's like,
I think of it like this.

2590
01:47:46,491 --> 01:47:48,740
It's like I've worked so hard,
I've worked so many jobs,

2591
01:47:48,741 --> 01:47:52,550
have worked so many things to get this
opportunity.

2592
01:47:52,850 --> 01:47:55,070
So why would I squander it?
You know what I mean?

2593
01:47:55,071 --> 01:47:57,410
It's like an see if I've worked so hard
now,

2594
01:47:57,560 --> 01:48:00,530
why would I keep working harder?
Not the perfect attitude,

2595
01:48:00,860 --> 01:48:02,510
but I'm also like,
I'm not gonna be one of those guys.

2596
01:48:02,511 --> 01:48:03,170
It's like,
you know,

2597
01:48:03,170 --> 01:48:04,790
oh I'm a headliner now cause I'm not.

2598
01:48:04,820 --> 01:48:06,890
Yeah,
that's going to man stand up.

2599
01:48:06,980 --> 01:48:07,820
But you could,
you know,

2600
01:48:07,821 --> 01:48:10,160
like a little of that.
Like Tony has got a lot of that in him.

2601
01:48:10,490 --> 01:48:12,710
But it's also why Tony Hinchcliffe so
fucking funny.

2602
01:48:12,740 --> 01:48:15,350
You know,
he rides it out and he does it the right

2603
01:48:15,351 --> 01:48:17,240
way.
Tony Hinchcliffe is a funny

2604
01:48:17,241 --> 01:48:19,910
motherfucker.
Tony Hinge because a mentor of mine,

2605
01:48:19,911 --> 01:48:21,500
man,
I mean he was one of the first guys I

2606
01:48:21,501 --> 01:48:23,630
talked to before when I had my first
roast battle.

2607
01:48:23,720 --> 01:48:26,500
Well,
he's another dude that fucking Tony.

2608
01:48:26,520 --> 01:48:28,770
He hustles.
He's always hustling.

2609
01:48:28,771 --> 01:48:30,110
Yeah,
that kid works hard.

2610
01:48:30,980 --> 01:48:34,250
He's very impressive in that way.
He's a bad motherfucker.

2611
01:48:34,310 --> 01:48:36,230
He is.
And he's always writing new shit.

2612
01:48:36,280 --> 01:48:37,700
They always,
constantly,

2613
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:39,470
there's a picture you posted of him when
I was,

2614
01:48:39,471 --> 01:48:42,530
remember when I was a younger and
counting,

2615
01:48:42,531 --> 01:48:43,790
I don't know if I'd worked here at the
time.

2616
01:48:43,820 --> 01:48:45,230
I think I had,
I think it was a door guy.

2617
01:48:45,260 --> 01:48:46,960
Uh,
and you'd post a picture of him.

2618
01:48:46,961 --> 01:48:50,330
It was right after you guys did a set
and then you had posted a picture of him

2619
01:48:50,331 --> 01:48:53,120
on the plane writing new jokes already
and you were just like,

2620
01:48:53,121 --> 01:48:54,410
this guy just didn't sat,
Blah Blah.

2621
01:48:54,411 --> 01:48:56,270
And He's already writing new jokes.
He goes,

2622
01:48:56,690 --> 01:48:58,890
Tony writes constantly.
I think you have have

2623
01:48:58,890 --> 01:49:00,450
to,
you can't commit to a laptop though.

2624
01:49:00,451 --> 01:49:03,570
He's got the stupid set up.
Whereas an ipad and it's a little fake

2625
01:49:03,630 --> 01:49:06,160
keyboard.
Oh,

2626
01:49:06,320 --> 01:49:09,480
finally.
Welcome to 2017 yeah.

2627
01:49:09,580 --> 01:49:10,740
He would say,
I don't even need,

2628
01:49:10,741 --> 01:49:12,270
I could,
you can't even store anything on this

2629
01:49:12,271 --> 01:49:13,800
piece of shit.
What are you doing here?

2630
01:49:13,801 --> 01:49:15,480
You can't even put a file on your
desktop.

2631
01:49:15,481 --> 01:49:18,630
Stop pretending that's a computer.
Got a goddamn computer.

2632
01:49:18,810 --> 01:49:20,820
Fuck.
It's weird.

2633
01:49:20,821 --> 01:49:22,440
Right.
People in their ipads,

2634
01:49:22,920 --> 01:49:24,270
he was a door guy.
Yup,

2635
01:49:24,510 --> 01:49:25,770
exactly.
Yup.

2636
01:49:26,260 --> 01:49:30,030
I mean there's a,
he's one of the best examples of a

2637
01:49:30,031 --> 01:49:33,510
recent graduate because he wasn't a door
guy that long ago.

2638
01:49:33,630 --> 01:49:34,500
No,
not at all.

2639
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:39,510
Tony's always had his fucking nose to
the grindstone but really smart about it

2640
01:49:39,511 --> 01:49:43,080
to really,
I'm really good with like taking apart

2641
01:49:43,100 --> 01:49:47,920
his act re retrying things in a
different order slip and new stuff in

2642
01:49:47,921 --> 01:49:48,660
there.

2643
01:49:48,660 --> 01:49:53,170
You know,
it's cool to like as a guy like you

2644
01:49:53,200 --> 01:49:54,040
working,
you know,

2645
01:49:54,041 --> 01:49:55,330
as you're sort of,
uh,

2646
01:49:55,570 --> 01:49:58,600
getting everything going and working at
a place like the common stories,

2647
01:49:58,601 --> 01:50:00,730
you get to see a bunch of different ways
people do it,

2648
01:50:01,420 --> 01:50:05,800
which is really like that main room show
on a Saturday night when you're getting

2649
01:50:05,801 --> 01:50:06,371
to see,
you know,

2650
01:50:06,371 --> 01:50:07,121
five,
six,

2651
01:50:07,121 --> 01:50:10,780
seven headliners in a row and you get to
see what's the difference in how they

2652
01:50:10,781 --> 01:50:13,150
handle things and how they set things
up.

2653
01:50:13,390 --> 01:50:14,650
The nine o'clock spot,
the nine,

2654
01:50:14,651 --> 01:50:17,920
15,
39 45 you're getting like this crazy

2655
01:50:17,921 --> 01:50:19,810
education and stand up.
Yeah.

2656
01:50:19,990 --> 01:50:22,660
I mean I watched people,
I mean it's cool cause I've got to see

2657
01:50:22,900 --> 01:50:26,740
the different careers and paths with
people like watching Brian Moses go from

2658
01:50:27,010 --> 01:50:32,010
a door guy to the host of his own show
that he created along with a lot of

2659
01:50:32,741 --> 01:50:33,810
great people,
you know,

2660
01:50:33,820 --> 01:50:34,760
the community.
Uh,

2661
01:50:35,140 --> 01:50:37,930
and just to see him do that and to see
where his career is going and also to

2662
01:50:37,931 --> 01:50:39,130
see Tony,
same thing,

2663
01:50:39,131 --> 01:50:41,650
his career and just the path east
taking.

2664
01:50:41,651 --> 01:50:42,670
And you know,
he also,

2665
01:50:42,671 --> 01:50:44,440
you know,
you used to write for Jeff Ross and all

2666
01:50:44,441 --> 01:50:47,230
these things and you know,
I got to ghost write to send jokes in.

2667
01:50:47,231 --> 01:50:49,750
You know,
that was something he also taught me

2668
01:50:49,751 --> 01:50:51,310
about was that he was just like,
you know what?

2669
01:50:51,340 --> 01:50:52,630
He was just like,
there's nothing,

2670
01:50:52,740 --> 01:50:53,573
you know,
he's like,

2671
01:50:53,740 --> 01:50:55,450
when you know those roasts are coming
and he's like,

2672
01:50:55,451 --> 01:50:56,860
you've already done the roast battle.
He's like,

2673
01:50:56,861 --> 01:50:58,990
just start pitching jokes.
Just ask.

2674
01:50:58,991 --> 01:51:00,760
You know what I mean?
And I did.

2675
01:51:00,761 --> 01:51:03,790
And that's I think what also helped get
me on the radar.

2676
01:51:04,280 --> 01:51:05,120
Yeah,
for sure.

2677
01:51:05,121 --> 01:51:07,580
Yeah,
it is beautiful to see God like Moses

2678
01:51:07,581 --> 01:51:09,700
get to host a show too.
He's such a good

2679
01:51:09,760 --> 01:51:12,640
dude.
He is one of the best dudes.

2680
01:51:12,670 --> 01:51:15,430
Uh,
and I owe so much to that guy because he

2681
01:51:15,431 --> 01:51:17,230
was the one that pushed for me getting a
job.

2682
01:51:17,231 --> 01:51:20,620
He was the one from,
it's really had my back since day one.

2683
01:51:20,720 --> 01:51:21,640
Um,
there's,

2684
01:51:21,670 --> 01:51:24,460
there was a few times where it just,
me being a young guy and having a

2685
01:51:24,461 --> 01:51:27,490
bitterness,
like when Montreat when roast battle

2686
01:51:27,491 --> 01:51:28,870
first one to Montreal,
I was like,

2687
01:51:28,900 --> 01:51:30,380
yeah,
we'll just young and bitter and cause I

2688
01:51:30,381 --> 01:51:30,851
was just like,
oh,

2689
01:51:30,851 --> 01:51:32,470
I'm not going well you know,
Blah Blah Blah.

2690
01:51:32,471 --> 01:51:36,040
I work on the show and I almost quit.
And then Moses was,

2691
01:51:36,400 --> 01:51:38,560
if he wasn't like a big brother,
he like took a person,

2692
01:51:38,561 --> 01:51:39,430
was just like,
Nah man,

2693
01:51:39,730 --> 01:51:41,470
stop fucking being a bitch.
You know,

2694
01:51:41,480 --> 01:51:44,050
he's like,
you can either get mad or work and get

2695
01:51:44,051 --> 01:51:45,220
better.
And I did.

2696
01:51:45,221 --> 01:51:49,300
I stayed and I just kept battling.
I kept doing standup and then the

2697
01:51:49,301 --> 01:51:50,890
opportunity came and knocked it out of
the park.

2698
01:51:51,530 --> 01:51:52,310
Yeah,
dude,

2699
01:51:52,310 --> 01:51:55,020
you killed it.
You killed it at the perfect time.

2700
01:51:55,050 --> 01:52:00,050
Yeah,
the launching pad of crying God studio

2701
01:52:01,880 --> 01:52:02,360
and,
but I,

2702
01:52:02,360 --> 01:52:04,310
it's like song.
I couldn't have done it without all

2703
01:52:04,311 --> 01:52:05,090
those guys.
Yeah,

2704
01:52:05,090 --> 01:52:07,280
no,
and I'll sure you pushing me too well,

2705
01:52:07,281 --> 01:52:08,420
all of us together.
You know,

2706
01:52:08,421 --> 01:52:13,421
I really do honestly get inspiration
from looking at your instagram page for

2707
01:52:13,731 --> 01:52:14,780
real.
Not bullshitting at all.

2708
01:52:14,960 --> 01:52:16,070
I see your instagram page,
I'm like,

2709
01:52:16,071 --> 01:52:17,120
damn,
this kid's hungry.

2710
01:52:17,121 --> 01:52:18,740
He's out there grinding,
you know,

2711
01:52:18,741 --> 01:52:21,380
constantly doing spots.
Those hotspots.

2712
01:52:21,570 --> 01:52:23,970
What was you telling me that too.
And also it was like,

2713
01:52:24,450 --> 01:52:26,070
just listen to you talk about those
lights,

2714
01:52:26,071 --> 01:52:29,520
but it's also hearing you talk about
having to go up after prior,

2715
01:52:29,910 --> 01:52:33,810
especially if such a hard time for him
and like having to do those things and

2716
01:52:33,811 --> 01:52:35,240
it was like five weeks.
Yeah,

2717
01:52:35,250 --> 01:52:36,083
man,
that's crazy.

2718
01:52:36,220 --> 01:52:36,611
Yeah,
it was.

2719
01:52:36,611 --> 01:52:40,360
It was the sad era of prior went before
he died.

2720
01:52:41,050 --> 01:52:44,350
He was in real bad shape,
but he still wanted to go on stage and

2721
01:52:44,351 --> 01:52:46,580
he would go on stage.
He was under medication,

2722
01:52:46,610 --> 01:52:47,750
you know,
it's a serious issue.

2723
01:52:47,751 --> 01:52:50,630
He couldn't walk and they would carry
him up there and they'd crank the mic

2724
01:52:50,631 --> 01:52:53,570
like shh.
It was so loud.

2725
01:52:53,571 --> 01:52:55,970
It was like hissing in the room and he
would,

2726
01:52:56,090 --> 01:52:57,950
you know,
he could barely talk and he would drink

2727
01:52:57,951 --> 01:52:59,870
and,
and it was just real weird,

2728
01:52:59,990 --> 01:53:00,920
you know,
it was real weird.

2729
01:53:00,921 --> 01:53:02,210
He just,
he couldn't,

2730
01:53:02,510 --> 01:53:06,440
couldn't really do stand up anymore.
I couldn't really look form the

2731
01:53:06,441 --> 01:53:09,560
sentences with the punch lines,
at least not in this sets that I saw.

2732
01:53:09,730 --> 01:53:11,990
Every one of them that I saw was hard to
watch.

2733
01:53:12,350 --> 01:53:15,560
And I'm a giant Richard Pryor Fan.
I mean,

2734
01:53:15,561 --> 01:53:18,080
I think he's,
he's probably the all time,

2735
01:53:18,081 --> 01:53:20,330
number one in my eyes.
I think he's number one.

2736
01:53:20,331 --> 01:53:24,380
If I look back at like all the comics
and their influence on people and the

2737
01:53:24,381 --> 01:53:27,290
honesty that he had on,
I mean without Lenny Bruce,

2738
01:53:27,291 --> 01:53:30,560
there's no one right.
But essentially,

2739
01:53:30,740 --> 01:53:32,930
and George Carlin plays a giant factor
there too.

2740
01:53:32,931 --> 01:53:34,220
There's a lot of guys that play a big
factor,

2741
01:53:34,221 --> 01:53:37,700
but I feel like prior was the guy to
this day,

2742
01:53:37,701 --> 01:53:41,300
I'll go back and watch his stuff when I
go in 1975.

2743
01:53:41,301 --> 01:53:43,790
This was just genius.
You look at everything that was going on

2744
01:53:43,791 --> 01:53:46,950
in 1975 he came out as a comic,
right.

2745
01:53:47,020 --> 01:53:47,830
Was just,
you know,

2746
01:53:47,830 --> 01:53:50,380
and that was the thing like everybody
loved prior,

2747
01:53:50,410 --> 01:53:52,180
every black people,
white people,

2748
01:53:52,181 --> 01:53:53,850
people are the rich people that were
poor.

2749
01:53:54,370 --> 01:53:56,560
And that's the thing that I liked the
most about him was like,

2750
01:53:56,590 --> 01:54:00,370
he could talk about these subjects and
these jokes and it didn't matter what

2751
01:54:00,371 --> 01:54:02,320
kind of background you came from,
you could relate to

2752
01:54:02,800 --> 01:54:04,100
hundred percent.
And he was,

2753
01:54:04,130 --> 01:54:04,950
he was,
uh,

2754
01:54:04,950 --> 01:54:06,260
you know,
essentially

2755
01:54:07,940 --> 01:54:11,120
the godfather of this style of standup.
They,

2756
01:54:11,121 --> 01:54:12,890
both you and I.
Do you know when,

2757
01:54:12,891 --> 01:54:15,050
a lot of ways,
like without him,

2758
01:54:15,530 --> 01:54:17,210
like what would it have been like back
then?

2759
01:54:17,390 --> 01:54:18,560
You know,
like who else was like,

2760
01:54:18,561 --> 01:54:23,561
even remotely is controversial and as
insightful and the way he could perform,

2761
01:54:26,210 --> 01:54:28,550
the way he announced,
he hated his words.

2762
01:54:28,551 --> 01:54:32,000
I mean he had some fucking bits.
They God damn camera,

2763
01:54:32,001 --> 01:54:33,530
which specialist?
I think it might've been

2764
01:54:34,830 --> 01:54:36,270
the first one.
He like,

2765
01:54:36,271 --> 01:54:38,910
it shows him walking out on stage.
The lights are still up,

2766
01:54:38,911 --> 01:54:42,120
people aren't fully sat down at their
seats and he just walks in and says,

2767
01:54:42,121 --> 01:54:43,800
all right guys.
And he just starts getting them to come

2768
01:54:43,801 --> 01:54:44,634
in and you're just like,
yeah,

2769
01:54:44,730 --> 01:54:45,690
wow.
Hill.

2770
01:54:45,810 --> 01:54:48,030
And he'd just get,
it's like,

2771
01:54:48,031 --> 01:54:49,950
I think,
I don't know if he gets right into it,

2772
01:54:49,951 --> 01:54:50,790
but he just,
you know,

2773
01:54:51,320 --> 01:54:52,760
it's seamless,
you know,

2774
01:54:52,900 --> 01:54:53,733
to to remember him

2775
01:54:53,830 --> 01:54:56,620
would joke about lighting himself on
fire.

2776
01:54:56,650 --> 01:54:57,790
So funny,

2777
01:54:58,490 --> 01:55:00,300
right after the freebasing thing
happened,

2778
01:55:00,310 --> 01:55:00,820
I mean,

2779
01:55:00,820 --> 01:55:05,410
come on,
who has the balls to joke about lighting

2780
01:55:05,411 --> 01:55:07,780
themselves on fire from Free Basin?

2781
01:55:08,050 --> 01:55:08,620
Like,
uh,

2782
01:55:08,620 --> 01:55:12,670
when peewee Herman came back out after
that huge thing happened and he walks

2783
01:55:12,671 --> 01:55:15,370
out and I think it was like the first
thing he was hosting right afterwards or

2784
01:55:15,371 --> 01:55:17,230
something or presenting and he comes out
and he goes,

2785
01:55:17,530 --> 01:55:19,600
it's dead silent.
People are like just kind of looking at

2786
01:55:19,601 --> 01:55:21,580
him and his right after he got caught
and stuff and he goes,

2787
01:55:21,581 --> 01:55:25,390
he goes,
you guys here have a any funny jokes

2788
01:55:25,391 --> 01:55:28,120
lately.
And it was right at the time that

2789
01:55:28,121 --> 01:55:32,410
everyone was cracking all those a herman
jokes about him being with thing and it

2790
01:55:32,411 --> 01:55:33,244
was just,
you know,

2791
01:55:33,460 --> 01:55:36,880
someone that can take some of that could
be serious and then

2792
01:55:37,520 --> 01:55:38,353
still

2793
01:55:38,890 --> 01:55:42,010
humanize themselves in a way like that.
And I think that's why the roast battle

2794
01:55:42,020 --> 01:55:43,470
so cool.
Cause it's like you're right.

2795
01:55:43,500 --> 01:55:44,250
Yeah.

2796
01:55:44,250 --> 01:55:46,110
Yeah.
Learn how to take what to write.

2797
01:55:46,170 --> 01:55:48,410
Not just dish it out but take it.
Yeah.

2798
01:55:49,010 --> 01:55:49,980
Yeah.
Peewee Herman.

2799
01:55:49,981 --> 01:55:52,020
Man,
that was a really fascinating one.

2800
01:55:53,160 --> 01:55:53,660
Okay.

2801
01:55:53,660 --> 01:55:55,490
Cause people kind of stood up for him
like,

2802
01:55:55,491 --> 01:55:57,380
yeah.
Like leave the fucking guy alone.

2803
01:55:57,381 --> 01:56:02,381
Like no one's angry at pee wee herman.
You'd have to rest them at the shit.

2804
01:56:03,410 --> 01:56:06,350
Of course he was beaten off.
It's a bunch of dudes fucking a 16 foot

2805
01:56:06,351 --> 01:56:07,800
screen.
Yeah.

2806
01:56:08,120 --> 01:56:09,390
What did you think was going to happen
but shit.

2807
01:56:09,410 --> 01:56:10,740
The rest of the guys that aren't beating
up.

2808
01:56:10,940 --> 01:56:15,940
Yeah.
No Shit.

2809
01:56:16,971 --> 01:56:19,550
Right,
gagging on each other,

2810
01:56:20,660 --> 01:56:23,690
fucking pounding each other on the
screen and he's not supposed to beat off

2811
01:56:24,080 --> 01:56:26,300
what's he supposed to do?
Right?

2812
01:56:26,360 --> 01:56:27,590
Yeah.
Fuck.

2813
01:56:27,591 --> 01:56:29,480
Leave 'em alone.
Who are you saving?

2814
01:56:29,720 --> 01:56:31,880
You know other dudes in there watching
people.

2815
01:56:31,881 --> 01:56:33,290
Fuck yeah,
exactly.

2816
01:56:34,370 --> 01:56:35,630
They feel threatened.
I want,

2817
01:56:35,640 --> 01:56:38,900
I like to watch people fucking art form.
I just imagine some dude.

2818
01:56:38,930 --> 01:56:40,400
Yeah,
I'm here.

2819
01:56:40,570 --> 01:56:42,620
Just some guys like getting ready and he
turns,

2820
01:56:42,621 --> 01:56:42,921
he's like,
oh,

2821
01:56:42,921 --> 01:56:43,970
she has it.
Oh Man,

2822
01:56:43,971 --> 01:56:46,400
I'm such a fan.
Do you think that's a crazy thing to

2823
01:56:46,401 --> 01:56:48,530
say,
but do you think that that would be

2824
01:56:48,560 --> 01:56:50,210
almost like,

2825
01:56:51,940 --> 01:56:56,440
like watching people have sex in another
time in another culture and another way

2826
01:56:57,040 --> 01:57:00,140
could almost be like an art form almost
be like a,

2827
01:57:00,730 --> 01:57:02,920
an expressive art form.
We're like,

2828
01:57:02,921 --> 01:57:06,640
if people fucking onstage was like stand
up and let people went to watch these

2829
01:57:06,641 --> 01:57:08,320
two people wanted to see how good you
fuck.

2830
01:57:08,350 --> 01:57:09,340
Oh,
that would be helpful.

2831
01:57:09,820 --> 01:57:12,760
Moves.
Like if if sex wasn't super taboo.

2832
01:57:12,800 --> 01:57:13,633
Yeah.
Yeah.

2833
01:57:13,720 --> 01:57:17,830
I get to entirely possible people would
be fucking in front of each other.

2834
01:57:17,860 --> 01:57:20,900
Like to show how you do it.
Just like how people show high dance on

2835
01:57:20,901 --> 01:57:22,870
the dance floor,
the dance by herself.

2836
01:57:22,871 --> 01:57:25,420
You're fucking doing break dancing and
spinning around.

2837
01:57:25,450 --> 01:57:28,090
I just don't know.
Now I just imagined there's just smaller

2838
01:57:28,091 --> 01:57:31,780
open mike communities of La,
like people fucking in front of other

2839
01:57:31,781 --> 01:57:32,670
people.
It's just like I just,

2840
01:57:32,671 --> 01:57:35,740
I'm working on this hot fuck move for
like a minute and I just feel like it's

2841
01:57:35,741 --> 01:57:36,760
going to kill dude.

2842
01:57:36,780 --> 01:57:38,220
This one fuck move.
I got to pee.

2843
01:57:38,230 --> 01:57:42,220
I kicked my one leg up and I catch it.
Like I'm in standing bow pose and I just

2844
01:57:42,221 --> 01:57:43,150
booked,
been behind,

2845
01:57:44,140 --> 01:57:46,750
kills the crowd every time.
Could you imagine if there was

2846
01:57:46,840 --> 01:57:51,130
professional fuck shows and like people
got cheered like Tang Po and fucking

2847
01:57:51,131 --> 01:57:54,100
kickboxer that walk out.
Everybody goes crazy.

2848
01:57:54,120 --> 01:57:55,980
Did you see his and hot new hour?
He's,

2849
01:57:55,981 --> 01:57:57,220
yeah,
he knows how to fog

2850
01:57:59,080 --> 01:58:01,720
standing ovation while this dude's just
finished.

2851
01:58:01,930 --> 01:58:05,860
Yeah,
I mean sex is obviously it's pleasurable

2852
01:58:05,861 --> 01:58:07,590
but it's also,
there's motion involved.

2853
01:58:07,640 --> 01:58:10,270
There's a lot of things that we watched
with motion involved at other people do.

2854
01:58:10,271 --> 01:58:11,800
That's fascinating,
right?

2855
01:58:11,830 --> 01:58:13,720
Like gymnastics,
gymnastics.

2856
01:58:13,730 --> 01:58:16,420
There's no,
I mean the only stakes are don't fall on

2857
01:58:16,421 --> 01:58:16,971
your head.
Yeah.

2858
01:58:16,971 --> 01:58:19,390
You've seen people do that.
Don't break your leg cause we've seen

2859
01:58:19,391 --> 01:58:21,220
people do that.
Like those stakes are really high.

2860
01:58:21,610 --> 01:58:23,230
But other than that,
like you know,

2861
01:58:23,231 --> 01:58:25,540
why are you really doing that?
You're doing it to show how you move.

2862
01:58:25,560 --> 01:58:27,530
Yeah.
You know my favorite is like,

2863
01:58:27,550 --> 01:58:31,030
cause it starts with guys like exactly
what you're describing.

2864
01:58:31,031 --> 01:58:32,890
I think for real.
Oh no way.

2865
01:58:32,891 --> 01:58:35,230
Sex Festival in Europe.
Oh my gosh.

2866
01:58:35,231 --> 01:58:38,920
Salon Erotico de Barcelona.
Jesus Christ.

2867
01:58:38,950 --> 01:58:41,050
I saw an article in vice where the
someone,

2868
01:58:41,290 --> 01:58:42,010
a bunch of people,
what

2869
01:58:42,010 --> 01:58:43,960
they're taking,
they interviewed people that were taking

2870
01:58:43,961 --> 01:58:47,140
photos at the thing and what they'd like
to do at their photos and how creepy

2871
01:58:47,141 --> 01:58:49,740
they are not going to be.
And they're all seem pretty crazy.

2872
01:58:49,980 --> 01:58:53,410
This quote out.
It's the feeling of in quotes,

2873
01:58:53,411 --> 01:58:55,300
I was there,
I was inches away from it.

2874
01:58:55,301 --> 01:58:58,210
I touched it.
That makes looking at my own pictures.

2875
01:58:58,211 --> 01:59:01,020
More exciting.
Alright guys.

2876
01:59:01,270 --> 01:59:04,300
Just taking photos of these people
having sex super up close.

2877
01:59:04,330 --> 01:59:05,800
I see.
It's crazy.

2878
01:59:05,830 --> 01:59:07,600
That dude's got like a Gopro.
I love it.

2879
01:59:07,601 --> 01:59:11,070
And like you look how expensive that
fucking flashes on this camera on.

2880
01:59:11,410 --> 01:59:12,730
Ooh,
Jesus Christ.

2881
01:59:12,870 --> 01:59:15,520
That's what's that?
The photos look like just super up close

2882
01:59:15,521 --> 01:59:16,360
guys.
Just getting away.

2883
01:59:16,361 --> 01:59:19,260
My favorite is this dude right in the
front with the camp.

2884
01:59:19,630 --> 01:59:23,050
How weird are we?
That's so strange.

2885
01:59:23,410 --> 01:59:25,210
Yeah,
but I don't think really people just get

2886
01:59:25,211 --> 01:59:27,760
together and they know.
I mean it just humans collectively as

2887
01:59:27,761 --> 01:59:28,390
all.
Yeah.

2888
01:59:28,390 --> 01:59:30,220
They just get together and watch people.
Fuck,

2889
01:59:30,610 --> 01:59:33,310
look at this guy's face that his face is
the best.

2890
01:59:33,490 --> 01:59:34,390
Oh,
he's indulging.

2891
01:59:34,420 --> 01:59:37,540
That guy's been,
he's been kept from without for so long.

2892
01:59:40,900 --> 01:59:43,240
Just the look of joy on some of these
guys.

2893
01:59:43,420 --> 01:59:45,700
Like I don't think that guy in the
left's taken it seriously,

2894
01:59:45,970 --> 01:59:49,000
but I think this guy in the right is
totally taking all these people.

2895
01:59:49,001 --> 01:59:53,020
Every single one of them is just dying
for virtual sex to come out.

2896
01:59:53,690 --> 01:59:55,900
They're just dying to just dying for
that.

2897
01:59:55,901 --> 01:59:58,060
That's what's going to change the whole
God damn ballgame.

2898
01:59:58,170 --> 02:00:01,540
Frank.
They put those virtual htc vive goggles

2899
02:00:01,541 --> 02:00:04,750
on and they,
they watched sex acts like this.

2900
02:00:04,751 --> 02:00:05,420
They go,
they're alive.

2901
02:00:05,420 --> 02:00:07,500
They have like sex offs and shit.
Oh,

2902
02:00:07,660 --> 02:00:10,030
just wait until,
I can't wait to my girlfriend catches me

2903
02:00:10,031 --> 02:00:11,830
with one of those sex doll.
No,

2904
02:00:11,831 --> 02:00:13,000
no,
just like the vr thing.

2905
02:00:13,001 --> 02:00:16,450
Like I want to hear her come in.
Yeah.

2906
02:00:16,580 --> 02:00:19,780
That's plenty of guys that have done
that and been called for sure.

2907
02:00:19,781 --> 02:00:20,770
There's got to be,
yeah,

2908
02:00:20,771 --> 02:00:21,280
for sure.

2909
02:00:21,280 --> 02:00:25,900
Kaiser in jail for that.
I guarantee you something went wrong and

2910
02:00:25,901 --> 02:00:28,720
it all started off from them jerking off
the htc vive on.

2911
02:00:28,750 --> 02:00:29,950
Oh,
that's hilarious.

2912
02:00:29,970 --> 02:00:32,050
Oh,
hits him with something and they throw

2913
02:00:32,051 --> 02:00:37,051
it back at her and she gets knocked out.
I told my girlfriend I wanted to,

2914
02:00:37,421 --> 02:00:39,370
uh,
when I get the,

2915
02:00:39,400 --> 02:00:41,260
cause they suddenly got the prize money,
but when I do,

2916
02:00:41,710 --> 02:00:43,810
I was like,
I want to just get it in cash and just

2917
02:00:43,811 --> 02:00:46,930
throw it at her.
So when she gets bruised she can call

2918
02:00:46,931 --> 02:00:48,760
the cops and they can be like,
what happened?

2919
02:00:48,790 --> 02:00:50,370
How did these brews come up?
And I'm just like,

2920
02:00:50,780 --> 02:00:53,920
it was approximately $10,000 in damage.
Uh,

2921
02:00:53,950 --> 02:00:56,940
she left but on pump,
you know,

2922
02:00:57,910 --> 02:01:00,610
taking her to Hawaii,
Hawaii's good spot.

2923
02:01:00,700 --> 02:01:02,170
Which island?
Maui.

2924
02:01:02,171 --> 02:01:04,660
I think now he's awesome.
They're all awesome.

2925
02:01:05,800 --> 02:01:09,490
The uh,
the big island is crazy because you

2926
02:01:09,491 --> 02:01:11,440
could actually fly over the volcano.

2927
02:01:11,710 --> 02:01:14,350
You can get in one of those helicopters
will take you to the place where the

2928
02:01:14,650 --> 02:01:18,970
volcano empties into the ocean and it's
like creating more island as you fly

2929
02:01:18,971 --> 02:01:21,460
over and you're like,
Whoa,

2930
02:01:21,490 --> 02:01:24,070
that's insane.
He sleep weird at night with that

2931
02:01:24,071 --> 02:01:25,280
knowledge.
Yeah.

2932
02:01:25,420 --> 02:01:26,690
Then it can just go to anytime.
Yeah.

2933
02:01:26,691 --> 02:01:28,420
You were on the side of an active
volcano.

2934
02:01:28,500 --> 02:01:30,670
Yeah.
Those people live there and harmony

2935
02:01:30,671 --> 02:01:32,200
though.
It's really interesting.

2936
02:01:32,201 --> 02:01:35,740
I think that being that connected to
nature the way they are because they

2937
02:01:35,741 --> 02:01:37,780
have the ocean there,
and not to say that Hawaiian people

2938
02:01:37,781 --> 02:01:39,800
don't have their problems,
like everybody has their problems,

2939
02:01:40,400 --> 02:01:44,780
but Hawaiian people have a more relaxed,
you know what they'll call like island

2940
02:01:44,781 --> 02:01:49,370
style way about them,
I think in some way is probably

2941
02:01:49,371 --> 02:01:53,660
influenced by the humility that you just
naturally get by being so connected to

2942
02:01:53,661 --> 02:01:55,280
nature.
The ocean right there,

2943
02:01:55,281 --> 02:01:56,270
the mountains right there.

2944
02:01:56,270 --> 02:01:58,730
It's just like they're so connected to
it since they're,

2945
02:01:58,780 --> 02:02:01,820
they're not,
they have never had city blinders on.

2946
02:02:01,880 --> 02:02:03,740
You know,
maybe a little bit in Honolulu,

2947
02:02:03,770 --> 02:02:06,590
people do,
but out there on the big island,

2948
02:02:06,591 --> 02:02:09,500
there's no city blinders man.
You're looking at something like really

2949
02:02:09,501 --> 02:02:12,770
insanely intense all the time.
Mountains and ocean.

2950
02:02:12,950 --> 02:02:14,960
It's amazing.
You're on a volcano sun,

2951
02:02:15,050 --> 02:02:18,890
it's beautiful and has a bunch of times
in history where the towns have had to

2952
02:02:18,891 --> 02:02:21,500
evacuate.
Lava is coming over the hill and it just

2953
02:02:21,501 --> 02:02:23,750
wipes out the whole talent town doesn't
even exist anymore.

2954
02:02:24,610 --> 02:02:28,670
Then Dude's put up these little shacks
on where the lava is and they rope it

2955
02:02:28,671 --> 02:02:33,180
off and that's like their land now.
Like they go back and land is like,

2956
02:02:33,210 --> 02:02:37,550
like gps doubt and they like put stakes
in and make like a little fence over the

2957
02:02:37,551 --> 02:02:40,430
fucking lava and then they put like a
house there.

2958
02:02:40,460 --> 02:02:43,910
Have you seen that Jamie?
See if you can find some photos of that.

2959
02:02:43,911 --> 02:02:45,260
It's,
it's so bizarre.

2960
02:02:45,350 --> 02:02:48,680
I was almost born in Hawaii houses on
the big island,

2961
02:02:49,210 --> 02:02:51,530
uh,
to like temporary houses in the big

2962
02:02:51,531 --> 02:02:54,170
island over lava fields because these
people,

2963
02:02:54,171 --> 02:02:55,400
they lost everything and they're like,
well,

2964
02:02:55,401 --> 02:02:57,320
this is the only thing I have.
It's just going to put a trailer up

2965
02:02:57,950 --> 02:02:59,450
where my fucking house is supposed to
be.

2966
02:02:59,640 --> 02:03:00,770
That's what happens.
Imagine.

2967
02:03:00,800 --> 02:03:02,780
Yeah.
Imagine just watching that go down where

2968
02:03:02,781 --> 02:03:05,780
your house burns down and you just like,
let it start over.

2969
02:03:06,020 --> 02:03:08,540
I think it,
why would they should have is land set

2970
02:03:08,541 --> 02:03:11,570
aside for people whose houses get fucked
up by volcanoes.

2971
02:03:11,610 --> 02:03:12,860
It happens all the time.
Yeah.

2972
02:03:12,861 --> 02:03:15,140
It seems like it would,
it happens enough where you should

2973
02:03:15,141 --> 02:03:17,480
probably have like a backup.
Maybe they do they have to have

2974
02:03:17,481 --> 02:03:18,320
insurance or something.

2975
02:03:18,380 --> 02:03:19,990
I think they'd probably have insurance.
It's gotta be,

2976
02:03:20,100 --> 02:03:22,640
have enough where they can relocate and
have a,

2977
02:03:22,890 --> 02:03:24,440
you know,
a house like their old house that got

2978
02:03:24,441 --> 02:03:27,590
eaten by the lava or is it enough to get
a shitty apartment?

2979
02:03:27,591 --> 02:03:28,790
You know?
I Dunno.

2980
02:03:28,850 --> 02:03:31,640
I Dunno how much they get paid,
but I would think that,

2981
02:03:31,641 --> 02:03:33,140
uh,
there's plenty of land.

2982
02:03:33,950 --> 02:03:34,571
What am I saying?
Well,

2983
02:03:34,571 --> 02:03:36,440
no,
Marxist won't give away their fucking

2984
02:03:36,460 --> 02:03:38,870
land.
Give away the land to the people that

2985
02:03:39,010 --> 02:03:40,640
want me to find temporary houses.
Right?

2986
02:03:40,930 --> 02:03:42,860
Yeah.
A temporary houses on lava fields in

2987
02:03:42,861 --> 02:03:44,840
Hawaii.
They staked it off,

2988
02:03:44,841 --> 02:03:47,990
I forget who showed it to me,
but they staked off their area and like

2989
02:03:47,991 --> 02:03:50,000
tied it off with like ribbon or
something like that.

2990
02:03:50,270 --> 02:03:50,751
And I'm like,
Hey,

2991
02:03:50,751 --> 02:03:52,590
this is my,
this is my land dunk.

2992
02:03:52,640 --> 02:03:55,190
Come,
don't come inside this lava pot patch.

2993
02:03:55,460 --> 02:03:56,293
I own it.

2994
02:03:56,930 --> 02:03:58,650
It just highlights how preposterous it,
it's,

2995
02:03:58,651 --> 02:03:59,870
yeah.
You know,

2996
02:04:00,140 --> 02:04:01,970
to live there,
but so awesome.

2997
02:04:02,150 --> 02:04:04,790
People will just stay there though.
They love it.

2998
02:04:05,330 --> 02:04:08,390
I went fishing last time was there,
I talked to this dude who had been

2999
02:04:08,391 --> 02:04:11,240
living there for long time,
decades.

3000
02:04:11,330 --> 02:04:14,000
He started out in the East Coast and uh,
you know,

3001
02:04:14,001 --> 02:04:15,560
the way he was talking about it,
man,

3002
02:04:15,561 --> 02:04:19,310
the way he was talking about just life,
I was like this guys,

3003
02:04:19,370 --> 02:04:24,370
he's so much more in tune with,
with like just,

3004
02:04:24,590 --> 02:04:25,880
just the reality.
I'm good dude.

3005
02:04:25,881 --> 02:04:27,650
Which suite?
The reality of life itself.

3006
02:04:27,651 --> 02:04:32,651
Just the cycle of life to see seeing it
out there on a boat in Hawaii,

3007
02:04:33,080 --> 02:04:36,050
pulling back into the doc,
living on this volcano in the middle of

3008
02:04:36,051 --> 02:04:36,441
nowhere.
I mean,

3009
02:04:36,441 --> 02:04:38,470
you're living in magical land.
Yeah.

3010
02:04:39,210 --> 02:04:40,740
People who daydream about that place.
Yeah,

3011
02:04:40,890 --> 02:04:41,850
yeah,
yeah.

3012
02:04:41,851 --> 02:04:43,590
They go there once a year and they just,
it just,

3013
02:04:43,591 --> 02:04:44,670
God amazing.

3014
02:04:44,690 --> 02:04:47,070
Did the guy lives there.
He got there and he was like,

3015
02:04:47,071 --> 02:04:48,330
fuck,
going back.

3016
02:04:48,630 --> 02:04:49,081
He was like,
Oh,

3017
02:04:49,081 --> 02:04:51,210
this is,
I could just stay here.

3018
02:04:51,450 --> 02:04:53,610
Fuck.
January in New York.

3019
02:04:53,790 --> 02:04:57,240
Like what?
My mom went there for her senior trip

3020
02:04:57,630 --> 02:05:00,600
and then when her senior trip ended,
she just didn't get back on the plane.

3021
02:05:00,710 --> 02:05:01,890
It's the move.
Yeah.

3022
02:05:01,891 --> 02:05:04,800
Here we go.
Not Quite but similar.

3023
02:05:05,460 --> 02:05:07,800
So this guy set it up on this lava
fields,

3024
02:05:07,830 --> 02:05:10,140
got a little house.
This is where my house used to be.

3025
02:05:11,220 --> 02:05:13,830
Yeah,
there was a whole a piece on it and

3026
02:05:13,831 --> 02:05:17,460
something that I was reading.
I don't remember what it was,

3027
02:05:17,461 --> 02:05:19,440
but it was just,
I get it,

3028
02:05:19,470 --> 02:05:20,610
you know,
and the guy didn't want to,

3029
02:05:20,810 --> 02:05:23,970
that was his spot.
He liked the spot and he could put up

3030
02:05:24,030 --> 02:05:25,290
temporary house there,
but it's just,

3031
02:05:25,291 --> 02:05:29,850
to me it's so,
it's just showing how powerful the will

3032
02:05:29,851 --> 02:05:30,684
of nature is.

3033
02:05:30,720 --> 02:05:34,680
This insane idea that you're going to
somehow or another state claim

3034
02:05:34,770 --> 02:05:38,370
circumvent pieces of above.
Haino look at that,

3035
02:05:38,371 --> 02:05:40,080
man.
We're just cutting through the

3036
02:05:40,081 --> 02:05:42,000
landscape.
Jesus Christ.

3037
02:05:42,001 --> 02:05:44,010
That's insane.
That's a road dude.

3038
02:05:44,040 --> 02:05:46,800
It just swamped right through that
place.

3039
02:05:47,430 --> 02:05:49,380
That is at that picture.
Go back to that picture again.

3040
02:05:49,680 --> 02:05:50,311
Oh,
look at that.

3041
02:05:50,311 --> 02:05:53,900
That's happening right there.
You could actually see it happening so

3042
02:05:53,910 --> 02:05:56,800
slow.
Have you seen videos of just lava taking

3043
02:05:56,801 --> 02:05:58,110
stuff out?
It's really slow,

3044
02:05:58,111 --> 02:05:58,410
right?
Yeah.

3045
02:05:58,410 --> 02:06:01,440
So how many feet a minute does it go?
Um,

3046
02:06:03,180 --> 02:06:04,290
and there's nothing they can do about
it,

3047
02:06:04,291 --> 02:06:05,124
right?
Nope.

3048
02:06:05,160 --> 02:06:09,090
They can't like push it though.
Look at that photo or that photo where

3049
02:06:09,091 --> 02:06:10,170
it's just cutting through.

3050
02:06:13,210 --> 02:06:14,043
Oh,

3051
02:06:15,140 --> 02:06:17,990
the one up right there.
No to the left of that guy with the red

3052
02:06:17,991 --> 02:06:19,340
shirt.
See the got the right to the left of

3053
02:06:19,341 --> 02:06:20,030
that?
Yeah.

3054
02:06:20,030 --> 02:06:21,920
Click on that.
Why in the fuck?

3055
02:06:22,490 --> 02:06:26,420
That's crazy.
We're looking at the actual lava itself

3056
02:06:26,450 --> 02:06:30,140
oozing and when you look at it as a
liquid rock,

3057
02:06:31,040 --> 02:06:35,240
like a hot liquid rock,
you realize what it really is like that

3058
02:06:35,241 --> 02:06:38,720
this is like sort of,
this is like the seeds of the,

3059
02:06:38,721 --> 02:06:41,000
the,
the actual islands themselves.

3060
02:06:41,030 --> 02:06:44,660
There's people who go to those places
and just get super close and study that.

3061
02:06:44,661 --> 02:06:47,510
That scares the shit anime.
They study it real close.

3062
02:06:47,511 --> 02:06:49,250
There's been a few scientists have died
from that.

3063
02:06:49,400 --> 02:06:51,380
I'm sure.
Can we make sense?

3064
02:06:51,440 --> 02:06:52,131
I think,
uh,

3065
02:06:52,131 --> 02:06:52,850
I think,
uh,

3066
02:06:52,850 --> 02:06:54,590
there was actually a famous one that
like,

3067
02:06:54,591 --> 02:06:56,420
uh,
oh,

3068
02:06:56,750 --> 02:06:58,010
what did he,
I want to go above.

3069
02:06:58,060 --> 02:06:59,780
There was no,
the one,

3070
02:06:59,810 --> 02:07:01,850
the one you were just your curse.
We wrote to the right of that,

3071
02:07:01,940 --> 02:07:03,140
right to the right of that.
What is that?

3072
02:07:03,200 --> 02:07:05,450
Whoa.
Oh my God.

3073
02:07:05,660 --> 02:07:08,150
That's a river.
That's a god Damn River

3074
02:07:09,840 --> 02:07:12,110
or river of molten rock,
of river,

3075
02:07:12,111 --> 02:07:15,110
of molten rock.
Just cutting through the earth.

3076
02:07:15,170 --> 02:07:16,700
Oh my God.
It starts way up there.

3077
02:07:16,780 --> 02:07:19,850
Oh,
imagine things lived in there.

3078
02:07:19,910 --> 02:07:21,290
Like Salmon,
like evil,

3079
02:07:21,291 --> 02:07:22,250
demon,
salmon,

3080
02:07:22,580 --> 02:07:26,450
lava sand,
and you have these fucking evil demon

3081
02:07:26,451 --> 02:07:28,520
bears at jump into the lava lake.

3082
02:07:30,530 --> 02:07:33,920
They can take a certain amount of lava
for like certain law and they're roaring

3083
02:07:33,921 --> 02:07:37,330
cause they're in pain and looking a
fucking team and fish to eat 10 meter

3084
02:07:37,331 --> 02:07:42,331
high fountain of Jesus Christ.
That's what the miners would create.

3085
02:07:43,030 --> 02:07:44,930
Does greedy,
greedy gold miners.

3086
02:07:45,040 --> 02:07:46,570
One of the,
if that thing hits you,

3087
02:07:47,050 --> 02:07:49,600
oh God.
Imagine like just a Blob of that hitting

3088
02:07:49,601 --> 02:07:51,160
your shoulder.
Fuck that.

3089
02:07:51,190 --> 02:07:52,990
Yeah.
Cause even the suits that the scientists

3090
02:07:52,991 --> 02:07:54,800
were when they go out,
that was like,

3091
02:07:54,801 --> 02:07:58,390
if a thing popped up and it hit them,
that'll eat right.

3092
02:07:58,391 --> 02:07:59,950
The room.
God Damn.

3093
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:03,310
How credible that you can.
Uh,

3094
02:08:04,270 --> 02:08:07,600
you have a quick second.
It's not like hot coals quite,

3095
02:08:07,601 --> 02:08:11,470
but it doesn't,
it doesn't melt things as quick as it

3096
02:08:11,471 --> 02:08:13,930
seems.
Or maybe it doesn't ask Christ to come

3097
02:08:13,931 --> 02:08:14,980
to the creek to it.
Man.

3098
02:08:14,981 --> 02:08:16,360
These guys are standing right next to
it.

3099
02:08:16,360 --> 02:08:19,250
What the fuck are they doing?
I can watch this.

3100
02:08:19,990 --> 02:08:21,520
Oh,
that terrifies me.

3101
02:08:21,550 --> 02:08:22,900
Oh,
it's just shooting out folks.

3102
02:08:22,901 --> 02:08:25,120
We're looking at stuff just shooting out
and splattering.

3103
02:08:25,430 --> 02:08:27,480
It's like the Earth's calming.
Oh Dude,

3104
02:08:27,481 --> 02:08:28,151
that's gross.
Oh,

3105
02:08:28,151 --> 02:08:30,190
how about this cooking steak with lava.
Oh,

3106
02:08:30,191 --> 02:08:31,690
I've seen that.
That's pretty dope.

3107
02:08:31,810 --> 02:08:32,710
Yeah,
they pour it.

3108
02:08:32,830 --> 02:08:34,360
Yeah.
See they pour it through this thing and

3109
02:08:34,361 --> 02:08:37,930
there's a grill underneath it and uh,
the,

3110
02:08:37,931 --> 02:08:41,490
just the heat of the lava pouring under
the grill cooks it shit out.

3111
02:08:41,491 --> 02:08:43,360
He sticks.
That's pretty bad.

3112
02:08:43,390 --> 02:08:46,120
Yeah,
I bet that's a serious God damn stake.

3113
02:08:47,070 --> 02:08:48,310
Ooh,
look how he does it.

3114
02:08:50,120 --> 02:08:52,120
I was,
he taught and love on top of it.

3115
02:08:52,720 --> 02:08:53,800
Oh no,
he's just pushing it down.

3116
02:08:54,640 --> 02:08:56,950
I've revised my cooking methods.
Frank Castillo.

3117
02:08:56,980 --> 02:08:59,830
Ooh.
I used to cook with high temperature and

3118
02:08:59,831 --> 02:09:02,080
I just try it this last week with low
temperature.

3119
02:09:02,580 --> 02:09:03,610
I'm changing my game.

3120
02:09:03,640 --> 02:09:05,080
Low temps where it's at.
Do you cook?

3121
02:09:05,410 --> 02:09:06,400
Oh,
my girlfriend does.

3122
02:09:06,401 --> 02:09:08,020
I know how to cook it.
What do you know how to cook?

3123
02:09:08,140 --> 02:09:09,700
I know how to cook.
Like don't say Mexican Shit.

3124
02:09:09,890 --> 02:09:12,430
I know how to cook like steak,
some pastas and stuff.

3125
02:09:12,670 --> 02:09:14,200
My girlfriend's probably watching this
right now.

3126
02:09:14,201 --> 02:09:17,890
Like that's a fucking lie.
Shit Lib.

3127
02:09:17,920 --> 02:09:20,980
Like do you like if you're alone by
yourself to cook yourself a meal?

3128
02:09:21,150 --> 02:09:22,480
Uh,
most of the time now are,

3129
02:09:22,481 --> 02:09:25,240
I'll try to make myself a sandwich.
I'm the most unhealthiest person I gotta

3130
02:09:25,660 --> 02:09:27,340
I gotta get back into it.
Yeah.

3131
02:09:27,400 --> 02:09:29,520
Yeah.
You do do to help your brain too.

3132
02:09:29,550 --> 02:09:30,383
Oh,
absolutely.

3133
02:09:31,240 --> 02:09:32,770
Eating healthy,
being healthy.

3134
02:09:32,771 --> 02:09:36,070
It definitely helps formulate your ideas
and also it alleviates,

3135
02:09:36,071 --> 02:09:39,370
you have a certain amount of tension
that comes with you're a failing body.

3136
02:09:40,060 --> 02:09:42,790
Yeah.
I used to wrestle and do Jujitsu for

3137
02:09:42,791 --> 02:09:45,910
like two years out of high school and
that was the most fun I've ever had

3138
02:09:45,911 --> 02:09:49,030
because I wouldn't compete or anything,
but it was just like I could eat

3139
02:09:49,031 --> 02:09:51,100
whatever I wanted and I would still just
say the same.

3140
02:09:51,100 --> 02:09:53,170
I felt great about myself and it was
just,

3141
02:09:53,530 --> 02:09:54,970
it was nice while I started doing it
again.

3142
02:09:54,971 --> 02:09:56,620
I'm gonna,
I'm gonna look into it right after.

3143
02:09:56,830 --> 02:09:58,440
We'll get you in a 10th planet Jiu
Jitsu.

3144
02:09:59,260 --> 02:10:00,460
Did you do it with the gear without
again,

3145
02:10:00,490 --> 02:10:02,080
I did it with a gay,
well,

3146
02:10:02,081 --> 02:10:04,240
if you wanted to do that,
there's John Junk Machado's that's,

3147
02:10:04,241 --> 02:10:07,110
that's close to.
I've been a metropolis.

3148
02:10:07,111 --> 02:10:10,180
It's great place and there's probably
somewhere near your neighborhood.

3149
02:10:10,210 --> 02:10:13,780
We'll talk about it off air.
It was probably even closer and probably

3150
02:10:13,781 --> 02:10:16,180
just as good.
There's southern California is like one

3151
02:10:16,181 --> 02:10:17,920
of the best places in the world if you
want to learn Jujitsu.

3152
02:10:17,950 --> 02:10:18,740
Oh yeah,
absolutely.

3153
02:10:18,740 --> 02:10:20,800
So many legit schools.
It's like,

3154
02:10:20,950 --> 02:10:24,400
it's like there's two is really in this
country and there's a bunch of really

3155
02:10:24,401 --> 02:10:27,130
good schools everywhere in this country.
You mean Jujitsu is really widespread

3156
02:10:27,430 --> 02:10:32,170
but the meccas there's a a mecca in New
York for sure and there's a mecca in

3157
02:10:32,171 --> 02:10:34,390
southern California but there's like
Chicago

3158
02:10:34,400 --> 02:10:35,233
strong.
Yeah,

3159
02:10:35,480 --> 02:10:37,220
I mean this,
this strong Jujitsu everywhere.

3160
02:10:37,221 --> 02:10:38,750
Phoenix,
Arizona strong.

3161
02:10:38,751 --> 02:10:40,490
There's like a lot of places have good,
you're good too.

3162
02:10:40,550 --> 02:10:43,460
And I love going on Instagram and
watching the tournaments and just the

3163
02:10:43,461 --> 02:10:46,340
different people like boot Chacha is
probably one of my favorite ones.

3164
02:10:46,550 --> 02:10:49,730
Do you ever follow viral Bjj on
instagram?

3165
02:10:50,240 --> 02:10:52,620
You liked a picture of it and I started
watching it too.

3166
02:10:52,621 --> 02:10:54,710
It was great.
I try not to follow them too often.

3167
02:10:54,711 --> 02:10:58,910
Like to repost their stuff cause I want
people to go there instead of looking at

3168
02:10:58,911 --> 02:11:00,060
mine,
you know?

3169
02:11:00,070 --> 02:11:04,190
And maybe people find out about their
videos but they have the best collection

3170
02:11:04,191 --> 02:11:08,930
of like sick moves,
just sick like move after move.

3171
02:11:08,931 --> 02:11:09,681
We were like,
oh,

3172
02:11:09,681 --> 02:11:11,990
and you can add,
these are real moves that like,

3173
02:11:12,200 --> 02:11:15,140
I've been doing Jujitsu for a long time
and I haven't seen before.

3174
02:11:15,410 --> 02:11:17,000
You know,
I'm not the most knowledgeable guy when

3175
02:11:17,001 --> 02:11:20,120
it comes to Jujitsu,
but I know enough about it that when I

3176
02:11:20,121 --> 02:11:23,790
see some completely new choke variation
that I've never seen before and

3177
02:11:23,800 --> 02:11:24,770
everybody starts doing it,
I'm like,

3178
02:11:24,771 --> 02:11:27,230
okay that wasn't around like this guy.

3179
02:11:27,230 --> 02:11:29,870
This guy has come up with some new thing
and people come up with a new thing.

3180
02:11:30,170 --> 02:11:31,580
You know?
It's pretty regular.

3181
02:11:31,610 --> 02:11:33,020
Yeah.
That's my favorite rep watching

3182
02:11:33,021 --> 02:11:35,180
Jujitsu's.
You can just see people just the game is

3183
02:11:35,181 --> 02:11:36,830
always changing.
That's the best part.

3184
02:11:36,920 --> 02:11:39,590
Well you know what it is like man,
it's like the same thing with striking.

3185
02:11:39,950 --> 02:11:42,380
When you see it at its highest level of
expression,

3186
02:11:42,410 --> 02:11:45,650
it's when it's only striking.
Striking at its highest level expression

3187
02:11:45,651 --> 02:11:50,651
for me is either professional boxing or
professional kickboxing or Muay Thai.

3188
02:11:51,830 --> 02:11:55,610
That's where you see,
I think to me really I like Muay Thai

3189
02:11:55,611 --> 02:11:57,800
the best because it seems like they're
doing everything.

3190
02:11:57,801 --> 02:12:00,620
So if you're going to agree to just
stand up,

3191
02:12:00,950 --> 02:12:03,470
like I feel like you should be able to
do whatever you want to do when you're

3192
02:12:03,471 --> 02:12:05,660
standing up.
In terms of like elbows,

3193
02:12:05,661 --> 02:12:07,700
knees,
it doesn't make any sense to limit

3194
02:12:07,701 --> 02:12:08,534
clinching.

3195
02:12:08,540 --> 02:12:12,470
So I think that's like the number one
stand up thing as far as like what I

3196
02:12:12,471 --> 02:12:14,750
want to say.
But the only way you get to see like the

3197
02:12:14,751 --> 02:12:16,970
highest level of expression as if
there's no takedowns.

3198
02:12:17,210 --> 02:12:20,330
If this is no submissions cause then
cause as soon as there's takedown,

3199
02:12:20,480 --> 02:12:22,940
soon as their submissions guys have a
totally different way,

3200
02:12:22,941 --> 02:12:25,750
but as soon as his ground and pound guys
have a totally different way of,

3201
02:12:25,751 --> 02:12:27,650
of,
of competing and moving and you're not

3202
02:12:27,651 --> 02:12:32,120
going to see the same as high a level of
expression and just true striking and

3203
02:12:32,121 --> 02:12:35,990
the same as what Jujitsu.
Like you see a lot of crazy moves and

3204
02:12:35,991 --> 02:12:39,950
Jujitsu that me might not see if you had
soccer kicks or stomps.

3205
02:12:40,280 --> 02:12:43,610
You probably wouldn't for a lot of those
things because there's a lot of stuff

3206
02:12:43,611 --> 02:12:47,090
that people could do to mitigate your
movement that they're agreeing not to

3207
02:12:47,091 --> 02:12:47,540
do.

3208
02:12:47,540 --> 02:12:49,280
It's not that you're just totally
controlling them,

3209
02:12:49,430 --> 02:12:52,490
but to get the highest level of
grappling to watch it,

3210
02:12:52,670 --> 02:12:54,350
you really Kinda have to have only
grappling.

3211
02:12:54,440 --> 02:12:56,630
Yeah.
Cause then it's like these are rules

3212
02:12:56,631 --> 02:13:00,110
were agreeing to and then from there you
can really start to learn how to bend

3213
02:13:00,111 --> 02:13:01,070
the rules.
Yeah.

3214
02:13:01,071 --> 02:13:02,390
That's amazing man.
It's like,

3215
02:13:02,780 --> 02:13:05,060
it really is like when you were talking
about with the verbal boxing,

3216
02:13:05,061 --> 02:13:09,210
it's like that in many ways like this
strategy based approaches to things and

3217
02:13:09,250 --> 02:13:10,880
that,
that that happens with Jujitsu.

3218
02:13:10,881 --> 02:13:14,450
What happens with striking and it's,
that's what's really interesting about

3219
02:13:14,451 --> 02:13:16,100
martial arts more than,
you know,

3220
02:13:16,101 --> 02:13:17,930
like people look at it in terms of like
this,

3221
02:13:18,350 --> 02:13:19,310
you know,
uh,

3222
02:13:19,340 --> 02:13:22,880
exciting violent thing,
this Rah Rah Macho thing,

3223
02:13:22,881 --> 02:13:24,350
which is definitely,
certainly is.

3224
02:13:24,351 --> 02:13:26,990
That's definitely certainly a part of
the appeal of MMA.

3225
02:13:27,230 --> 02:13:32,230
But also what the appeal is,
is that it's insanely to do and you have

3226
02:13:32,941 --> 02:13:35,460
to be insanely brave to choose to do it.

3227
02:13:35,460 --> 02:13:40,230
For a living and in and it's,
it's insanely dangerous cause you're,

3228
02:13:40,231 --> 02:13:41,850
you're,
you might get shinned in the face.

3229
02:13:41,851 --> 02:13:44,390
You give my kid flying knee knockout
like you,

3230
02:13:44,400 --> 02:13:45,960
like there's a,
um,

3231
02:13:46,020 --> 02:13:48,510
a recent fight bitchin Chris Weidman and
Yoel Romero.

3232
02:13:48,511 --> 02:13:49,344
Did you see that?
Fine.

3233
02:13:49,550 --> 02:13:54,550
I saw a club Ood Weidman was doing
really well in that fight too and Yoel

3234
02:13:54,560 --> 02:13:57,870
Romero launched this flying knee that
hit him dead in the head.

3235
02:13:58,200 --> 02:14:01,080
She goes boom,
and just crushed him.

3236
02:14:02,010 --> 02:14:05,010
And I remember watching that going and
that's Chris Weidman.

3237
02:14:05,070 --> 02:14:07,620
Yeah.
That's not like a regular dude that's

3238
02:14:07,621 --> 02:14:09,450
former UFC champion.
Chris Weidman,

3239
02:14:09,451 --> 02:14:13,650
one of the baddest motherfuckers on
planet earth and Yoel Romero just did

3240
02:14:13,651 --> 02:14:16,610
that to him.
That does that.

3241
02:14:16,670 --> 02:14:19,410
That is a sport that is like no other
any given Sunday.

3242
02:14:19,411 --> 02:14:20,430
Man.
What are you gonna say?

3243
02:14:20,431 --> 02:14:24,180
Jamie George Saint Pierre signs to
return to the UFC.

3244
02:14:24,300 --> 02:14:25,140
Yeah,
I heard,

3245
02:14:26,490 --> 02:14:30,690
I was talking to my friend Stephie
Crooklyn from twitter,

3246
02:14:31,400 --> 02:14:32,640
a Steffi Hayes,
the writer,

3247
02:14:32,670 --> 02:14:33,600
and she was,
uh,

3248
02:14:33,900 --> 02:14:34,620
tell me about this.

3249
02:14:34,620 --> 02:14:36,300
She actually was the one to break the
news to me.

3250
02:14:36,690 --> 02:14:38,250
So George Saint Pierre is going to fight
again.

3251
02:14:38,460 --> 02:14:39,241
Good for him,
man.

3252
02:14:39,241 --> 02:14:40,920
It took some time off.
Chilled out.

3253
02:14:41,730 --> 02:14:44,130
Feels good.
It's still still training.

3254
02:14:44,370 --> 02:14:46,890
That's the thing about George never got
out of shape at all.

3255
02:14:47,010 --> 02:14:49,170
Constantly training,
constantly learning.

3256
02:14:49,171 --> 02:14:51,780
I bet he's better than ever.
Nobody comes back and people think that

3257
02:14:51,781 --> 02:14:53,670
he's going to have loss of step.
I bet he's better than ever.

3258
02:14:53,730 --> 02:14:55,080
Yeah.
He wouldn't be coming back.

3259
02:14:55,110 --> 02:14:56,160
He wasn't.
Yeah.

3260
02:14:56,220 --> 02:14:58,200
And I've been hearing crazy shit about
his grappling.

3261
02:14:58,230 --> 02:15:00,030
I've been hearing it's grappling.
So off the chain,

3262
02:15:00,210 --> 02:15:05,100
it was just a better than ever that a
underestimating someone is a huge

3263
02:15:05,250 --> 02:15:08,130
advantage and a tool we'll specially at
garlic,

3264
02:15:08,131 --> 02:15:11,310
George and George St Pierre did not
become George Saint Pierre.

3265
02:15:11,311 --> 02:15:13,830
Now by you know,
not knowing what's up,

3266
02:15:14,190 --> 02:15:16,080
he knows what he's doing.
If he's coming back,

3267
02:15:16,081 --> 02:15:18,720
it's because he knows he's healed up it.

3268
02:15:18,720 --> 02:15:20,940
Probably better than ever.
This guy is going to be really

3269
02:15:20,941 --> 02:15:25,180
interesting to watch him return because
he's different in the way he approaches

3270
02:15:25,200 --> 02:15:27,840
fighting,
I think than almost anybody before him.

3271
02:15:27,841 --> 02:15:32,700
And he influenced so many people after
him and that he's like almost has no ego

3272
02:15:32,970 --> 02:15:34,550
when it comes to,
um,

3273
02:15:34,620 --> 02:15:39,000
like listening to his coaches and like
absorbing information and uh,

3274
02:15:39,001 --> 02:15:41,340
you know,
being taught need you see him rolling

3275
02:15:41,341 --> 02:15:45,090
and training and drilling with people.
And I've had the opportunity to,

3276
02:15:45,170 --> 02:15:47,310
to drill with him and do some kick moves
with him,

3277
02:15:47,610 --> 02:15:51,090
go over some stuff and he's just so open
minded and so fucking smart.

3278
02:15:51,330 --> 02:15:55,560
That guy is a really interesting dude
cause he's not a mean guy at all.

3279
02:15:55,830 --> 02:15:58,020
He's like,
he would never think if you met him that

3280
02:15:58,021 --> 02:16:01,950
he was this world champion,
like one of the greatest,

3281
02:16:01,951 --> 02:16:04,500
if not the greatest,
I would say the greatest welterweight of

3282
02:16:04,501 --> 02:16:05,334
all time.

3283
02:16:05,430 --> 02:16:07,950
You know?
Does that mean that he would beat Damien

3284
02:16:07,950 --> 02:16:09,030
Maia a hundred percent of the time?
No.

3285
02:16:09,031 --> 02:16:10,920
Does that mean he would be tyron woodley
might not.

3286
02:16:10,980 --> 02:16:12,840
I don't know.
But if you look at his accomplishments,

3287
02:16:13,320 --> 02:16:16,350
he was in my opinion,
the greatest welterweight of all time

3288
02:16:16,680 --> 02:16:18,740
and super nice guy.
Yeah,

3289
02:16:19,080 --> 02:16:22,080
smart.
He speaks two languages,

3290
02:16:22,140 --> 02:16:26,040
fluent English and fluent French.
Really Fascinating Guy,

3291
02:16:26,041 --> 02:16:26,874
Matt.
So if he's,

3292
02:16:26,910 --> 02:16:29,100
if he's coming back after this amount of
time off,

3293
02:16:29,350 --> 02:16:30,460
he knows what the fuck he's doing.
Yeah.

3294
02:16:30,760 --> 02:16:32,950
He's gonna come strong.
He's going to,

3295
02:16:32,960 --> 02:16:35,860
he's going to look awesome.
Or you know,

3296
02:16:36,280 --> 02:16:37,440
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking
about.

3297
02:16:39,390 --> 02:16:43,290
Also today,
a way drinks opened up from Mcgregor

3298
02:16:43,290 --> 02:16:45,690
Mayweather.
How can you do that if it hasn't really

3299
02:16:45,691 --> 02:16:49,950
been so fast?
It has to take place before May 31st,

3300
02:16:49,950 --> 02:16:51,780
2018 so like if it doesn't happen,
the batch just go away.

3301
02:16:51,781 --> 02:16:54,810
That kind of happens from time to time.
Like the card has to happen before your

3302
02:16:54,811 --> 02:16:57,750
fight for your bed to actually be legit.
But

3303
02:16:59,460 --> 02:17:00,030
I'm sorry,
go ahead.

3304
02:17:00,030 --> 02:17:03,180
I'll just say he opened up as a minus
2,525 to one.

3305
02:17:03,730 --> 02:17:07,470
I think it's Berto.
He opened up at minus 4,000 so I don't

3306
02:17:07,471 --> 02:17:09,780
know if that's saying that Mcgregor's
got a better chance to win,

3307
02:17:09,781 --> 02:17:12,510
but usually it's just set up 25 to one
is not so hot.

3308
02:17:12,720 --> 02:17:15,120
Yeah.
Mcgregor's plus 1100 yeah.

3309
02:17:15,121 --> 02:17:18,630
I think conventional wisdom is that a
floyd boxes the shit out of him.

3310
02:17:19,170 --> 02:17:19,890
But,
uh,

3311
02:17:19,890 --> 02:17:21,750
Teddy Atlas had something very
interesting to say.

3312
02:17:21,751 --> 02:17:26,751
He thinks that floyd is not recognizing
the fact that conor might just decide to

3313
02:17:27,091 --> 02:17:29,700
get disqualified.
That like if,

3314
02:17:29,880 --> 02:17:32,790
if it starts getting crazy,
like if they're in the middle of a fight

3315
02:17:32,910 --> 02:17:37,200
and he decides he can't beat him,
he might decide to just fucking flip him

3316
02:17:37,201 --> 02:17:40,800
on his ass.
Atlas Mcgregor would cheat against

3317
02:17:40,801 --> 02:17:43,050
mayweather.
Think proclaim himself as king of the

3318
02:17:43,051 --> 02:17:43,940
ring.
Hmm.

3319
02:17:44,160 --> 02:17:45,070
That's an interesting thought.

3320
02:17:45,360 --> 02:17:46,260
Well,
here's the thing.

3321
02:17:46,261 --> 02:17:49,480
If Mcgregor decided to start kicking
floyd and,

3322
02:17:49,580 --> 02:17:52,260
and decided to take him down,
floyd is a dead man.

3323
02:17:52,590 --> 02:17:52,911
Oh,
he's,

3324
02:17:52,911 --> 02:17:54,780
yeah,
he's a hundred percent dead.

3325
02:17:55,020 --> 02:17:59,340
There's not a thing unless he catches
connor coming in with the haymaker to

3326
02:17:59,341 --> 02:18:02,130
end all haymakers.
It can take that iris assassin out with

3327
02:18:02,131 --> 02:18:04,110
one punch.
Connor's going to grab him.

3328
02:18:04,410 --> 02:18:06,660
If he grabs him,
he's gonna rag him to the ground.

3329
02:18:06,690 --> 02:18:09,090
He's going to do whatever the fuck he
wants to do once he's there.

3330
02:18:09,091 --> 02:18:10,360
And if he doesn't do that,
it kicked,

3331
02:18:10,361 --> 02:18:12,720
come from the outside.
He can hit him from a place.

3332
02:18:12,721 --> 02:18:16,170
Floyd can't even touch him.
He'll just side kicked the shit out of

3333
02:18:16,171 --> 02:18:18,930
his legs.
He'll stay on the outside moving around.

3334
02:18:18,931 --> 02:18:21,600
Connor's a fast man.
He's not slow.

3335
02:18:21,900 --> 02:18:24,660
And in the first round in particular,
in the first round,

3336
02:18:24,750 --> 02:18:26,790
if he decides to start kicking floyd's
legs,

3337
02:18:26,880 --> 02:18:28,830
like if they agreed on that,
like some sort of a,

3338
02:18:28,840 --> 02:18:30,690
a Gnocchi versus Ali match.

3339
02:18:30,810 --> 02:18:31,830
Did you ever see that?
No.

3340
02:18:32,430 --> 02:18:33,151
In,
what was it?

3341
02:18:33,151 --> 02:18:37,800
1960s Mohammed Ali had a match against a
Enoki.

3342
02:18:37,801 --> 02:18:40,410
Who's this famous guy who was a pro
wrestler?

3343
02:18:41,140 --> 02:18:43,680
What does Antonio in?
Is that how you say his first name?

3344
02:18:45,120 --> 02:18:49,620
I think that's Antonio and Gnocchi.
Sorry for people who are big fans of

3345
02:18:49,621 --> 02:18:50,550
his,
he's awesome.

3346
02:18:50,820 --> 02:18:52,200
But uh,
I just forgot his name.

3347
02:18:52,380 --> 02:18:57,180
So he fought Ali and what he did was he
laid on his back and kicked Ali and the

3348
02:18:57,181 --> 02:19:01,290
legs.
See Ali would come near him and like he

3349
02:19:01,291 --> 02:19:03,760
was gonna Jab and a Gnocchi with look
like he was going,

3350
02:19:03,761 --> 02:19:08,210
I didn't have any gloves on either.
It was weird because I don't know if it

3351
02:19:08,730 --> 02:19:11,640
like what the rules of the fight,
where he goes.

3352
02:19:11,641 --> 02:19:15,870
It seemed like Ali's should have known
that this dude could kick his legs.

3353
02:19:16,140 --> 02:19:18,150
So boom,
see he would kick his legs and he kept

3354
02:19:18,151 --> 02:19:20,790
doing it over and over again and look at
Ollie's kicking him and holding on to

3355
02:19:20,791 --> 02:19:21,660
the ropes.
Like,

3356
02:19:21,661 --> 02:19:22,830
Nah,
you can't hold the ropes,

3357
02:19:22,890 --> 02:19:25,470
but you can kick the legs,
but you can't hold the ropes.

3358
02:19:25,471 --> 02:19:26,450
Like what?
Yeah,

3359
02:19:26,600 --> 02:19:28,100
like this,
I guess when

3360
02:19:28,100 --> 02:19:31,160
Ali was probably look at,
he's kicking the inside of his legs.

3361
02:19:31,700 --> 02:19:34,790
This is probably when Ali was band.
Does that make sense?

3362
02:19:34,791 --> 02:19:36,950
Is that when they did it [inaudible] 76
it said,

3363
02:19:37,010 --> 02:19:38,030
oh,
that's way past that.

3364
02:19:38,031 --> 02:19:39,770
Then I pass that.
That's crazy.

3365
02:19:39,771 --> 02:19:42,080
So this is must ben.
He just needed the money or they offered

3366
02:19:42,081 --> 02:19:44,360
him a shitload of money,
but this is when he was the heavyweight

3367
02:19:44,361 --> 02:19:45,081
champ then,
right?

3368
02:19:45,081 --> 02:19:47,990
Is that the case?
Was Ali the champ at the time?

3369
02:19:48,440 --> 02:19:50,510
Oh good.
He's kicking the fuck out of his leg.

3370
02:19:50,750 --> 02:19:54,350
Could just but scooting and kicking his
legs and looking to,

3371
02:19:54,770 --> 02:19:57,430
looking to get them in a leg lock.
It

3372
02:19:58,960 --> 02:19:59,810
just weird.
He's,

3373
02:19:59,900 --> 02:20:02,780
he was allowed to kick the legs.
I think we've talked about this.

3374
02:20:02,781 --> 02:20:05,990
They might've must have had some sort of
an agreement that it was okay to kick

3375
02:20:05,991 --> 02:20:06,824
the legs

3376
02:20:07,680 --> 02:20:09,320
is the reigning heavyweight champion.

3377
02:20:10,140 --> 02:20:12,270
Wow.
How nuts is that?

3378
02:20:13,620 --> 02:20:14,300
Okay.

3379
02:20:14,300 --> 02:20:16,700
6 million.
He was offered $6 million for the fight.

3380
02:20:16,780 --> 02:20:18,250
Whoa.
Oh Man.

3381
02:20:21,150 --> 02:20:22,620
Is that enough?
Yeah.

3382
02:20:22,930 --> 02:20:24,250
Well,
I don't know if he won.

3383
02:20:24,251 --> 02:20:26,590
Did he win or did he get,
that's the thing about boxing is the

3384
02:20:26,591 --> 02:20:27,830
rules.
Okay.

3385
02:20:27,980 --> 02:20:30,070
What'd you say?
Answer Mcmahon Sr was involved too.

3386
02:20:30,220 --> 02:20:32,470
That's hilarious.
Senior meeting,

3387
02:20:32,471 --> 02:20:33,304
Vince Mcmahon's

3388
02:20:33,770 --> 02:20:36,440
sold tickets to a closed circuit
telecast at Shea Stadium.

3389
02:20:36,480 --> 02:20:39,600
Two 30 shit.
33,000 people showed up for that.

3390
02:20:39,630 --> 02:20:41,040
Wow.
Of course,

3391
02:20:41,460 --> 02:20:43,380
of course everyone's going to want to
see him box.

3392
02:20:43,410 --> 02:20:44,850
So where does it say about the rules
like,

3393
02:20:44,880 --> 02:20:46,500
oh,
was you're allowed to kick the legs?

3394
02:20:46,810 --> 02:20:47,643
What does it say?

3395
02:20:50,510 --> 02:20:50,890
Yeah,

3396
02:20:50,890 --> 02:20:52,840
very.
There were varying rule or varying

3397
02:20:53,470 --> 02:20:55,870
claims over the years over what the
rules actually work.

3398
02:20:55,980 --> 02:21:00,980
It says no limitations on kicking or
grappling and all types of kicking,

3399
02:21:01,621 --> 02:21:04,770
throwing and grappling were allowed in.
The bell was the referee.

3400
02:21:04,771 --> 02:21:09,300
So Jean labelle was the referee.
Of course he was.

3401
02:21:09,630 --> 02:21:11,040
He's Jane Labelle.
Gene labelle's,

3402
02:21:11,041 --> 02:21:13,620
a legendary judo character.
He's awesome.

3403
02:21:13,621 --> 02:21:15,840
He's been on the podcast.
He's a,

3404
02:21:16,290 --> 02:21:18,720
a legendary guy in the world of martial
arts.

3405
02:21:18,970 --> 02:21:21,400
This last quote too,
from professional breasts.

3406
02:21:21,450 --> 02:21:23,560
Uh,
Brett Hart was working for Nokia at the

3407
02:21:23,561 --> 02:21:27,340
time and he claimed in an autobiography
that the black Muslims who are backing

3408
02:21:27,341 --> 02:21:29,890
Ali made it clear that if a Gnocchi laid
a finger on their champ,

3409
02:21:29,891 --> 02:21:32,500
they would kill him.
That's why Gnocchi lay on his back for

3410
02:21:32,501 --> 02:21:35,920
15 rounds kicking Ali in the Shin.
So not to use his hands.

3411
02:21:36,300 --> 02:21:37,380
Whoa,
Whoa,

3412
02:21:38,190 --> 02:21:40,920
whoa.
That's so he didn't have any gloves on.

3413
02:21:40,921 --> 02:21:42,420
He was allowed to punch it with no
gloves.

3414
02:21:42,770 --> 02:21:43,603
I said,
wow.

3415
02:21:43,650 --> 02:21:45,390
I mean it was allowed to maybe,
but he didn't.

3416
02:21:45,550 --> 02:21:48,970
But other forces outside and told him
that if they,

3417
02:21:49,090 --> 02:21:51,430
that's what it says.
Claim made by Bret Hart.

3418
02:21:51,820 --> 02:21:54,460
But you know what man?
Bret harts and entertainer,

3419
02:21:54,550 --> 02:21:55,380
isn't he?
Yeah.

3420
02:21:55,380 --> 02:21:57,820
He didn't like entertainers make
entertaining stories.

3421
02:21:59,350 --> 02:22:00,430
True.
Who knows?

3422
02:22:01,180 --> 02:22:03,250
That could be one of them,
one of them,

3423
02:22:03,251 --> 02:22:06,820
a plot lines,
you know what I mean?

3424
02:22:06,821 --> 02:22:10,390
Whenever you merge into the world of pro
wrestling and then another pro wrestler

3425
02:22:10,391 --> 02:22:11,081
tells you,
well,

3426
02:22:11,081 --> 02:22:12,490
I know what happened,
man.

3427
02:22:12,491 --> 02:22:15,370
The illuminati came down and gave him an
ultimatum.

3428
02:22:15,670 --> 02:22:19,660
Lose the match to the undertake or we
will take your house.

3429
02:22:20,620 --> 02:22:22,060
You know,
who knows,

3430
02:22:22,061 --> 02:22:23,920
man.
It's all a plot lines for those folk.

3431
02:22:24,590 --> 02:22:26,190
Where are you big fan?
No,

3432
02:22:26,191 --> 02:22:27,210
in high school I was,
oh,

3433
02:22:27,211 --> 02:22:30,360
come by you now.
My cousins were huge wrestling fans and

3434
02:22:30,361 --> 02:22:34,270
I was the smallest one that would always
get suplex to desat.

3435
02:22:34,280 --> 02:22:36,050
Cool.
Do they at least suplex you on the

3436
02:22:36,051 --> 02:22:36,640
couch?

3437
02:22:36,640 --> 02:22:37,350
Uh,
yeah.

3438
02:22:37,350 --> 02:22:38,820
Most of the time.
Yeah.

3439
02:22:38,821 --> 02:22:41,730
Tony Hinchcliffe still to this day loves
wrestling.

3440
02:22:41,731 --> 02:22:45,120
He almost took a job.
He almost took a job with the wwe as a

3441
02:22:45,121 --> 02:22:46,950
writer.
They wanted him to move to New York,

3442
02:22:48,690 --> 02:22:50,030
Connecticut.
That's where their,

3443
02:22:50,031 --> 02:22:51,930
their studios.
And he was like,

3444
02:22:51,931 --> 02:22:53,370
damn,
he loves it,

3445
02:22:53,410 --> 02:22:55,380
Dude.
He goes to those matches and shit and

3446
02:22:55,381 --> 02:22:56,520
goes nuts.
Cheers.

3447
02:22:56,521 --> 02:22:57,880
He's so silly.
Yeah.

3448
02:22:57,990 --> 02:22:58,730
They have,
uh,

3449
02:22:58,730 --> 02:22:59,290
they have,
uh,

3450
02:22:59,290 --> 02:23:01,620
they have a podcast and it's called the
four horsemen,

3451
02:23:02,610 --> 02:23:04,680
Tony and a few other guys.
They just talking about wrestling.

3452
02:23:04,710 --> 02:23:06,050
It's the best.
Hey man,

3453
02:23:06,060 --> 02:23:07,050
people love it.
I'll tell you,

3454
02:23:07,110 --> 02:23:10,500
people never got more mad at me than me
given tonio hard time for liking

3455
02:23:10,530 --> 02:23:11,880
wrestling.
Oh yeah.

3456
02:23:11,970 --> 02:23:14,460
God,
wrestling fans are dying were so mad at

3457
02:23:14,461 --> 02:23:16,230
me.
They were so mean.

3458
02:23:17,220 --> 02:23:18,360
I mean,
it's great though.

3459
02:23:20,010 --> 02:23:21,180
I had,
it was funny in high school,

3460
02:23:21,181 --> 02:23:22,740
man,
I'll tell you that I had a friend in

3461
02:23:22,741 --> 02:23:26,820
high school who was training to become a
wrestler and I remember people would

3462
02:23:26,821 --> 02:23:28,980
give him shit about it all the time and
then he was like,

3463
02:23:28,981 --> 02:23:29,550
no man.

3464
02:23:29,550 --> 02:23:30,990
Wrestling training camps,
no joke.

3465
02:23:30,991 --> 02:23:33,390
And then he came in,
he took his shirt off and he had just

3466
02:23:33,391 --> 02:23:36,000
bruises because I guess when they would
practice,

3467
02:23:36,001 --> 02:23:41,001
they would hit each other as hard as
possible so they know exactly how hard

3468
02:23:41,911 --> 02:23:43,560
it is that they're going to get hit.
You know what I mean?

3469
02:23:43,561 --> 02:23:47,460
So they can judge the palms,
we offer each other and they would just

3470
02:23:47,461 --> 02:23:50,910
practice that over and over and they
practicing all the falls and stuff and

3471
02:23:50,911 --> 02:23:53,220
like how to get it right and stuff.
But yeah,

3472
02:23:53,221 --> 02:23:54,330
if they fuck up,
they just,

3473
02:23:54,331 --> 02:23:55,980
they,
they really can hurt themselves,

3474
02:23:55,981 --> 02:23:56,850
you know?
Yeah.

3475
02:23:56,880 --> 02:23:58,970
They definitely can mean wrestling,
uh,

3476
02:23:59,070 --> 02:24:00,870
involves a lot of contact.
Oh yeah.

3477
02:24:00,871 --> 02:24:03,270
There's a,
it's so brutal on the body.

3478
02:24:03,540 --> 02:24:07,740
All those wrestlers that at some point
in time wind up getting badly injured.

3479
02:24:07,741 --> 02:24:09,510
Like Dan Gable was like one of the
greatest,

3480
02:24:09,511 --> 02:24:10,890
if not the greatest of all time.

3481
02:24:11,130 --> 02:24:14,790
He's got like all kinds of replacements,
hip replacements and all shit and all

3482
02:24:14,791 --> 02:24:17,640
that kind of crazy shit.
He just had this indomitable will that

3483
02:24:17,650 --> 02:24:21,030
sort of outran his own joints.
He loved entertaining the people.

3484
02:24:21,360 --> 02:24:22,440
Yeah.
He was an animal man.

3485
02:24:22,520 --> 02:24:24,090
That guy was phenomenal.
The movie,

3486
02:24:24,091 --> 02:24:26,970
the wrestler is more of my dad's
favorite movies and a mirror watching

3487
02:24:26,971 --> 02:24:28,790
that with them.
Me and my dad loved to go watch movies

3488
02:24:28,791 --> 02:24:29,730
get,
it's kind of like our thing.

3489
02:24:29,970 --> 02:24:31,890
So we bond and no,
I never saw that.

3490
02:24:31,891 --> 02:24:35,100
That was the Mickey Rourke.
I saw like a scene from it and that was

3491
02:24:35,101 --> 02:24:35,881
it.
I just never,

3492
02:24:35,881 --> 02:24:38,010
I always wanted to,
I never sat down and watched it.

3493
02:24:38,330 --> 02:24:39,900
I I,
it's so funny.

3494
02:24:39,901 --> 02:24:41,610
It was like,
I just watched a grown man cry.

3495
02:24:41,820 --> 02:24:43,420
Like I watched my dad.
Ah,

3496
02:24:43,421 --> 02:24:43,990
yeah.
Me and my,

3497
02:24:43,990 --> 02:24:47,310
my dad can't.
I mean I love my dad to best to death,

3498
02:24:47,311 --> 02:24:49,560
but when we watch like father,
son movies,

3499
02:24:49,561 --> 02:24:51,750
anything like that,
it's always a tear jerker for him.

3500
02:24:51,950 --> 02:24:52,771
Aw,
me too.

3501
02:24:52,771 --> 02:24:53,910
I'm the same way.
Oh,

3502
02:24:54,090 --> 02:24:55,770
that's awesome.
It's hilarious.

3503
02:24:55,950 --> 02:24:59,130
I couldn't watch pursuit of happiness.
Which ones that it was will smith and a

3504
02:24:59,131 --> 02:25:00,180
kid.
Oh,

3505
02:25:00,181 --> 02:25:02,050
when it becomes homeless,
fuck that.

3506
02:25:02,510 --> 02:25:03,301
I was like,
no,

3507
02:25:03,301 --> 02:25:05,100
no,
you're not going to do that to me.

3508
02:25:05,700 --> 02:25:07,300
I'll tell you what.
I don't want to,

3509
02:25:07,530 --> 02:25:09,780
I'll give away a giant spoiler alert if
I say this,

3510
02:25:09,781 --> 02:25:11,880
but I tried to watch that movie that we
were talking about.

3511
02:25:12,570 --> 02:25:14,540
Uh,
the arrival or arrival,

3512
02:25:14,580 --> 02:25:15,500
whatever it is.
I tried to,

3513
02:25:15,510 --> 02:25:16,620
I got through the first hand.
I'm like,

3514
02:25:16,621 --> 02:25:19,260
fuck you
shut it off.

3515
02:25:19,261 --> 02:25:23,680
Not Interested in anymore.
You're not going to play my strings.

3516
02:25:23,830 --> 02:25:27,510
Ooh.
You're talking about with her daughter.

3517
02:25:29,910 --> 02:25:33,700
You fuck the figure out the movies.
Do you cry during Armageddon?

3518
02:25:33,730 --> 02:25:35,770
Just the asteroid and nope.
Nope.

3519
02:25:35,860 --> 02:25:40,090
Knew it was fake at all.
I knew the other one was fake too deep

3520
02:25:40,091 --> 02:25:41,700
impact.
That was fake as fuck too.

3521
02:25:42,700 --> 02:25:44,260
It was terrible.
Do you think that people from deep,

3522
02:25:44,261 --> 02:25:47,740
deep impact meet people that are fans of
Armageddon?

3523
02:25:47,800 --> 02:25:48,491
They go,
Oh my God,

3524
02:25:48,491 --> 02:25:50,170
I love you from that Bruce Willis movie.
You're like,

3525
02:25:50,171 --> 02:25:51,280
fuck you bitch.
Hey.

3526
02:25:51,281 --> 02:25:53,620
I was in the other one.
It came out a few months ago,

3527
02:25:53,621 --> 02:25:57,310
but we came out first.
We were at first armageddons bullshit.

3528
02:25:58,180 --> 02:25:59,260
Well,
he thought that Armageddon.

3529
02:25:59,261 --> 02:26:00,450
They had the idea first.
No,

3530
02:26:00,460 --> 02:26:01,000
no,
no.

3531
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:03,490
That's propaganda.
That's fake news.

3532
02:26:03,640 --> 02:26:06,520
Fake News.
Bruce Willis,

3533
02:26:06,521 --> 02:26:07,840
man.
Yeah.

3534
02:26:08,050 --> 02:26:09,550
He just said I'm good.
Yeah,

3535
02:26:09,840 --> 02:26:11,710
stop.
Just chill.

3536
02:26:11,890 --> 02:26:14,800
Probably just go surfing and shit.
What does he do now?

3537
02:26:14,930 --> 02:26:15,763
Does he still acting?

3538
02:26:17,740 --> 02:26:18,573
Yeah.

3539
02:26:19,730 --> 02:26:21,800
What are you gonna say?
You were going to say something?

3540
02:26:22,640 --> 02:26:26,930
Spoiler alert.
Spoiler alert.

3541
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:27,800
Yeah.
Yeah.

3542
02:26:27,800 --> 02:26:28,633
I can't wait.
All right.

3543
02:26:28,940 --> 02:26:33,940
Keep your trap shut.
You don't want to ruin it for everybody.

3544
02:26:35,840 --> 02:26:38,490
Yeah,
he's always been like that guy.

3545
02:26:38,540 --> 02:26:40,340
There's like some dudes that get
attached.

3546
02:26:40,341 --> 02:26:42,830
It's just really kind of fascinating
when you think about how many people

3547
02:26:42,831 --> 02:26:46,520
there are and think how many dudes get
attached to like that action movies

3548
02:26:46,521 --> 02:26:47,660
genre.
Oh,

3549
02:26:47,750 --> 02:26:49,400
like Bruce Willis,
like boom,

3550
02:26:49,401 --> 02:26:50,800
die hard.
You know,

3551
02:26:50,801 --> 02:26:55,801
like he was the guy for the actual movie
snarky action star who figured out how

3552
02:26:56,721 --> 02:26:58,100
to save everybody.
Yeah,

3553
02:26:58,110 --> 02:26:59,900
that first diehard man.
What was the one?

3554
02:26:59,930 --> 02:27:03,020
The the one,
the football one with Damon Wayans right

3555
02:27:03,021 --> 02:27:04,070
above there.
That right there,

3556
02:27:04,520 --> 02:27:06,890
the last boy scout.
There was another one he did and he's

3557
02:27:06,891 --> 02:27:11,891
always just like troubled cop blend in
pizza up with milk for breakfast,

3558
02:27:12,141 --> 02:27:13,830
you know,
you know what I mean?

3559
02:27:15,800 --> 02:27:18,230
He's always that guy smoking a
cigarette.

3560
02:27:18,231 --> 02:27:20,420
Well,
I guess we're just going to have to find

3561
02:27:20,421 --> 02:27:21,740
out.
Yeah,

3562
02:27:21,741 --> 02:27:23,620
he was the same dude in 16.
Dude.

3563
02:27:23,630 --> 02:27:26,340
He's in a gang of movies like that.
At the same dude in um,

3564
02:27:26,770 --> 02:27:28,630
a pulp fiction.
Right.

3565
02:27:28,640 --> 02:27:31,430
He played that boxer dude.
He was great.

3566
02:27:31,431 --> 02:27:32,570
Hudson Hawke,
man.

3567
02:27:33,920 --> 02:27:35,840
Bruce Willis has been in some good
fucking movies,

3568
02:27:35,841 --> 02:27:37,910
man.
What was the one with the kid?

3569
02:27:38,120 --> 02:27:38,953
Oh,
is the kid.

3570
02:27:39,170 --> 02:27:40,160
No,
the one with,

3571
02:27:40,161 --> 02:27:40,994
um,
that's true.

3572
02:27:42,430 --> 02:27:44,520
There's a movie called the kid.
Uh,

3573
02:27:45,740 --> 02:27:47,210
he's a go mercury,
right?

3574
02:27:47,240 --> 02:27:48,620
Oh,
6 cents.

3575
02:27:48,621 --> 02:27:50,160
Yeah.
A lot of move with kids.

3576
02:27:50,510 --> 02:27:53,480
That movie was fucked up.
That was what movie was like.

3577
02:27:53,481 --> 02:27:56,660
Whoa.
What is this I think emanates coming

3578
02:27:56,661 --> 02:27:58,370
back.
Um,

3579
02:27:58,400 --> 02:28:02,360
I don't know about all that dude.
That village movie may be done with him.

3580
02:28:02,361 --> 02:28:03,920
I clean my fucking hands.
No,

3581
02:28:03,921 --> 02:28:05,690
I get it.
He's someone put it this way.

3582
02:28:05,691 --> 02:28:07,280
He's like m nights,
like the girlfriend,

3583
02:28:07,281 --> 02:28:12,080
you know better than should come back to
no better fuck her man.

3584
02:28:14,630 --> 02:28:16,730
I actually liked that elevator movie in,
in,

3585
02:28:16,820 --> 02:28:18,760
in parts.
I enjoyed the ride.

3586
02:28:18,770 --> 02:28:20,150
Did,
I didn't think it was the most

3587
02:28:20,151 --> 02:28:22,420
satisfying way to end it,
but it's hard.

3588
02:28:22,550 --> 02:28:24,190
How do you end in movie about,
you know,

3589
02:28:24,290 --> 02:28:25,450
evil elevator?
Yeah.

3590
02:28:26,090 --> 02:28:31,090
You know what I'm saying?
They did their best photo booth kept my

3591
02:28:31,641 --> 02:28:34,670
attention for a movie being in just the
whole time.

3592
02:28:34,671 --> 02:28:36,670
It's about a photo,
but it was that the phone booth.

3593
02:28:36,671 --> 02:28:39,140
So is that the um,
the Robin Williams won?

3594
02:28:39,170 --> 02:28:39,450
No,
no.

3595
02:28:39,450 --> 02:28:40,510
He's the crazy guy.
Who was the,

3596
02:28:40,730 --> 02:28:42,590
the photo guy?
That was a good one.

3597
02:28:42,591 --> 02:28:44,350
I was talking about how I met.
I met spoken stem.

3598
02:28:44,351 --> 02:28:45,830
It's a phone booth.
Oh,

3599
02:28:45,831 --> 02:28:49,610
Phone Call Collin farrel.
Colin Farrell was on the other day.

3600
02:28:50,210 --> 02:28:52,770
I saw it and I took my friend to see it
and they were mad at me.

3601
02:28:52,771 --> 02:28:57,771
It was buried with Ryan Reynolds and
he's buried in a cough in the whole

3602
02:28:58,581 --> 02:28:59,180
movie.

3603
02:28:59,180 --> 02:29:00,890
Oh yeah.
I never saw hard to watch.

3604
02:29:00,891 --> 02:29:03,530
It's really claustrophobic.
Fuck fat.

3605
02:29:04,220 --> 02:29:07,610
Not Interested.
I don't need to see evil shit to make me

3606
02:29:07,611 --> 02:29:10,280
feel bad.
Show me some shit that's not real.

3607
02:29:10,640 --> 02:29:12,040
You know?
I know like,

3608
02:29:12,260 --> 02:29:15,290
like when we're talking about Avatar,
like Steven crowder got upset about

3609
02:29:15,291 --> 02:29:18,410
Avatar wan Avatar.
It was like a propaganda movie.

3610
02:29:19,220 --> 02:29:19,791
I was like,
look dude,

3611
02:29:19,791 --> 02:29:22,040
that's an awesome movie about blue
aliens.

3612
02:29:22,100 --> 02:29:24,350
The movie was awesome.
They flew dragons.

3613
02:29:24,351 --> 02:29:26,420
I loved it.
It was in three d.

3614
02:29:26,450 --> 02:29:29,060
I got to see it in Imax.
That shit was awesome.

3615
02:29:29,330 --> 02:29:31,520
My mom was,
my mom does that too.

3616
02:29:31,521 --> 02:29:33,590
All the time.
She'll watch like she watches the Matrix

3617
02:29:33,591 --> 02:29:36,300
and she'll read into it too much.
It's like it's about China and American

3618
02:29:36,410 --> 02:29:40,520
war anti-capitalism movie.
I can't be here for this.

3619
02:29:40,730 --> 02:29:42,110
This is propaganda.
No,

3620
02:29:42,111 --> 02:29:44,750
it's a movie about big blue people that
fly dragons.

3621
02:29:44,750 --> 02:29:47,210
You fuck.
This is a wonderful movie.

3622
02:29:47,670 --> 02:29:50,960
This movie's fun.
People get so caught up in that though.

3623
02:29:51,380 --> 02:29:53,770
Oh yeah.
They don't want to support those Goddamn

3624
02:29:53,810 --> 02:29:56,690
lefties and their crazy ideas about blue
people.

3625
02:29:57,000 --> 02:30:00,830
The blue people deserve to live giant
blue people that ride dragons,

3626
02:30:00,980 --> 02:30:03,290
shoot bows and arrows.
That movie was the shit.

3627
02:30:03,320 --> 02:30:05,120
It was so good.
So good.

3628
02:30:05,420 --> 02:30:07,910
The only thing I'm bummed out about is
they're going to do a,

3629
02:30:08,030 --> 02:30:11,330
part two is going to be underwater,
so that means no bows and arrows.

3630
02:30:11,331 --> 02:30:13,300
That's bullshit.
I love heart pounds,

3631
02:30:13,910 --> 02:30:15,170
like bows and arrows better.
Man.

3632
02:30:17,180 --> 02:30:19,340
That was a bad ass.
My was a great movie.

3633
02:30:20,230 --> 02:30:22,520
I just don't understand people who
couldn't appreciate that.

3634
02:30:23,450 --> 02:30:24,950
I don't know.
I feel like it's one of the things where

3635
02:30:24,951 --> 02:30:27,560
like people just have gotten to this
point where they're like,

3636
02:30:28,050 --> 02:30:29,690
no,
I don't want to say my opinion matters

3637
02:30:29,691 --> 02:30:30,071
so much.
What?

3638
02:30:30,071 --> 02:30:31,730
It's like,
no one can just enjoy something anymore.

3639
02:30:31,731 --> 02:30:35,480
Everyone was asked to have either a
shitty opinion on it or like a really,

3640
02:30:35,481 --> 02:30:39,830
really not so shitty.
Well I see people use all sorts of

3641
02:30:39,831 --> 02:30:42,410
different things to sort of make their
point and I see if you were trying to

3642
02:30:42,411 --> 02:30:46,090
make your point about some anti
corporate movie like you would see like

3643
02:30:46,091 --> 02:30:46,970
this and say,
but I,

3644
02:30:47,050 --> 02:30:51,470
it's what I see is like dynamics that
make a good storyline where you're

3645
02:30:51,471 --> 02:30:54,710
invested in the plot.
I'm not looking at it as a propaganda

3646
02:30:54,711 --> 02:30:57,440
film because it's in fucking Spain's.
Yeah,

3647
02:30:57,441 --> 02:31:01,010
and they have floating islands and none
of that's real.

3648
02:31:01,290 --> 02:31:05,990
The dragons aren't real either.
It's not real that marine guys,

3649
02:31:05,991 --> 02:31:08,420
not a real person.
Like when people freaked out over the

3650
02:31:08,421 --> 02:31:10,610
star wars movie,
Oh it's so amazing.

3651
02:31:10,611 --> 02:31:12,740
It's not real.
What do you carry?

3652
02:31:12,741 --> 02:31:15,490
You fucks.
And people are getting mad that they try

3653
02:31:15,491 --> 02:31:17,420
to force diversity and the star wars
movies.

3654
02:31:17,510 --> 02:31:18,220
Oh,
when we go,

3655
02:31:18,220 --> 02:31:19,800
it's going to have the grill things.

3656
02:31:20,010 --> 02:31:22,560
You got to have the black guy.
He was a fucking storm trooper.

3657
02:31:23,310 --> 02:31:26,100
I see what you're doing.
Hollywood see we doing,

3658
02:31:27,350 --> 02:31:31,590
you're trying to fuck with what we like.
Try to take away our glory.

3659
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:35,280
Glory of white people dominating science
fiction movies.

3660
02:31:35,550 --> 02:31:39,780
Has anybody dominated any genre more
than white people have dominated science

3661
02:31:39,781 --> 02:31:40,960
fiction movies?
I come to you.

3662
02:31:40,961 --> 02:31:44,490
So true.
I come to you with a sincere question.

3663
02:31:44,730 --> 02:31:46,770
He wanted to talk about a lack of
diversity.

3664
02:31:47,160 --> 02:31:51,110
Black guys in science fiction movies
have zero chance of survival.

3665
02:31:51,540 --> 02:31:53,790
It is like zero eaten first,
right?

3666
02:31:53,850 --> 02:31:57,360
That fucking dude [inaudible] alien.
That really cool black dude who got

3667
02:31:57,361 --> 02:31:58,830
sweaty all the time.
Favorite one.

3668
02:31:59,010 --> 02:32:01,200
He uh,
he got Jack Pretty quick.

3669
02:32:01,260 --> 02:32:03,800
He didn't make it very deep.
Didn't who got,

3670
02:32:04,020 --> 02:32:05,910
he didn't get killed first though.
I got second.

3671
02:32:06,450 --> 02:32:09,300
Did he get second?
Super Normal.

3672
02:32:09,540 --> 02:32:12,420
Like think of like all the big time
science fiction movies.

3673
02:32:12,480 --> 02:32:14,290
Dune.
Um,

3674
02:32:14,650 --> 02:32:17,160
well,
doom is a dean then you getting weird

3675
02:32:17,161 --> 02:32:20,610
though because that's the Rock Dune.
Doon Oh dude.

3676
02:32:20,810 --> 02:32:22,380
Yeah.
Those were all white people.

3677
02:32:22,381 --> 02:32:24,300
That's a good one.
That's a perfectly great one.

3678
02:32:24,360 --> 02:32:26,240
That's a good one.
When they,

3679
02:32:27,480 --> 02:32:29,460
Paul Moody used to have a great joke
about this.

3680
02:32:30,390 --> 02:32:35,100
He used to have a great joke about a
Lavar Burton on star wars about they

3681
02:32:35,101 --> 02:32:36,870
finally put one on tv.
They make him blind.

3682
02:32:39,460 --> 02:32:41,580
Man,
I'm totally taking it out of,

3683
02:32:41,640 --> 02:32:43,320
you know,
cause he used a lot of n bombs,

3684
02:32:44,160 --> 02:32:46,110
but uh,
it was hilarious.

3685
02:32:46,680 --> 02:32:48,890
It's fucking funny and true.
It's true.

3686
02:32:48,891 --> 02:32:51,960
So Lieutenant Uhura,
she's basically a secretary stay very

3687
02:32:51,961 --> 02:32:55,410
desk co Captain Kirk's out here saving
the day.

3688
02:32:55,411 --> 02:32:56,950
You know what I mean?
That's really what it was.

3689
02:32:58,350 --> 02:32:59,550
Yeah.
I mean she would take the call,

3690
02:32:59,551 --> 02:33:01,920
sir.
It's the aliens are on the other line.

3691
02:33:03,060 --> 02:33:05,970
She was the one doing all the clerical
work.

3692
02:33:06,060 --> 02:33:06,893
Yeah.
Right.

3693
02:33:07,080 --> 02:33:09,090
You know,
she wasn't captain Kirk's equal.

3694
02:33:10,420 --> 02:33:12,060
Okay.
And as that cling on,

3695
02:33:12,180 --> 02:33:14,880
there's Lavar Burton was his goggles and
there's the cling on.

3696
02:33:14,881 --> 02:33:16,650
Now the cling on it's super
questionable.

3697
02:33:17,220 --> 02:33:21,430
Is that a black guy that has a terrible
alien thing going on in me?

3698
02:33:21,431 --> 02:33:24,600
Are we looking at diversity and did they
bounce off that guy in the far right and

3699
02:33:24,660 --> 02:33:27,660
making wider to sort of balance it out
because that guy's white as fuck.

3700
02:33:27,690 --> 02:33:29,700
Oh yeah,
he's supposed to be a robot.

3701
02:33:29,701 --> 02:33:31,740
Right.
But tell me you can make an android.

3702
02:33:31,741 --> 02:33:34,560
It looks exactly like a person,
but you can't make his face not white as

3703
02:33:34,561 --> 02:33:35,820
fuck.
That's ridiculous.

3704
02:33:35,821 --> 02:33:39,090
He's Goddamn hands are normal color.
How come you idiots only painted his

3705
02:33:39,091 --> 02:33:41,420
face?
It's also he paid his fucking hands.

3706
02:33:41,421 --> 02:33:43,290
His hands are nice and pink.
And it's also like,

3707
02:33:43,291 --> 02:33:46,540
why is the white guy so logical?
And you know the other guys just so he

3708
02:33:46,541 --> 02:33:49,320
comes from a race of like aggressive one
on the pop star Trek.

3709
02:33:49,350 --> 02:33:50,820
Super logical too though,
isn't he?

3710
02:33:50,930 --> 02:33:51,763
Yeah.
Yeah.

3711
02:33:51,780 --> 02:33:53,490
Lavar Burton was super smart on that
show.

3712
02:33:53,640 --> 02:33:56,850
Oh yeah.
Science fiction and black people.

3713
02:33:57,030 --> 02:33:57,900
What,
what else?

3714
02:33:57,960 --> 02:33:59,220
Alien,
the movie alien.

3715
02:33:59,250 --> 02:34:01,830
No black people.
Ender's game actually had a great

3716
02:34:01,840 --> 02:34:05,170
Allianz rather was anders anders game.
It was a,

3717
02:34:05,700 --> 02:34:07,680
if you read the book cause uh,
the other,

3718
02:34:08,280 --> 02:34:10,740
there's a lot of skepticism where his
uh,

3719
02:34:11,650 --> 02:34:13,110
politicalness lies.
Ah,

3720
02:34:13,140 --> 02:34:15,230
but they would say that's a word sir.
I know I made it.

3721
02:34:15,390 --> 02:34:18,040
Um,
they say that he references

3722
02:34:18,040 --> 02:34:21,100
a lot and um,
it talks a lot about like the Vietnam

3723
02:34:21,101 --> 02:34:22,930
war in the,
in the ender's game book.

3724
02:34:22,931 --> 02:34:25,690
Like they say that the certain races
that he's talking about,

3725
02:34:25,691 --> 02:34:28,720
he's like,
he alludes to them being like the

3726
02:34:28,721 --> 02:34:30,790
Vietnamese.
I think I could be making all this up

3727
02:34:30,791 --> 02:34:33,520
probably,
but Anders Anders Games are really good

3728
02:34:33,521 --> 02:34:35,410
movie.
But at the end of it,

3729
02:34:35,411 --> 02:34:38,920
it's all about like this alien race.
It's eventually coming to attack and

3730
02:34:38,921 --> 02:34:42,460
they have these kids do this game,
but the whole time,

3731
02:34:42,610 --> 02:34:44,800
spoiler alert,
they're actually fighting and they're

3732
02:34:44,801 --> 02:34:48,850
controlling the ships from Christ.
It's an amazing book.

3733
02:34:48,890 --> 02:34:50,590
Uh,
and a decent movie.

3734
02:34:50,980 --> 02:34:53,050
I actually haven't seen them all white
people.

3735
02:34:53,080 --> 02:34:54,550
Yeah,
but that was another other guy.

3736
02:34:54,551 --> 02:34:56,410
The Indian Fella.
What's that guy's name?

3737
02:34:57,070 --> 02:34:59,440
Oh,
that's Ben Kingsley is any English

3738
02:34:59,470 --> 02:35:01,140
Indian.
Yeah,

3739
02:35:01,150 --> 02:35:02,450
he just put county.
No,

3740
02:35:02,480 --> 02:35:03,281
that's,
that's what he is,

3741
02:35:03,281 --> 02:35:04,540
Bro.
Come on Bro.

3742
02:35:04,540 --> 02:35:06,160
That's how he talks.
He's an Englishman then,

3743
02:35:06,161 --> 02:35:06,994
right?
Isn't he?

3744
02:35:07,540 --> 02:35:10,750
Isn't he of Indian descent and somewhere
you ever see that one movie?

3745
02:35:10,751 --> 02:35:12,610
There was any plate.
This badass gangster.

3746
02:35:12,640 --> 02:35:14,200
It's a really good movie.
Yeah.

3747
02:35:14,201 --> 02:35:15,750
He's played a lot of really bad ass
games.

3748
02:35:15,800 --> 02:35:19,300
He played that just really nene gangster
was it say here?

3749
02:35:20,590 --> 02:35:21,520
Just English.
Okay.

3750
02:35:21,660 --> 02:35:23,320
Hmm.
So I'm making things up.

3751
02:35:23,820 --> 02:35:25,330
He damn play Gandy though.
No,

3752
02:35:25,331 --> 02:35:26,164
no.
Look at his name.

3753
02:35:26,330 --> 02:35:28,750
Born Krishna.
Oh yeah.

3754
02:35:28,751 --> 02:35:29,680
Okay.
He's Indian.

3755
02:35:29,770 --> 02:35:32,620
Jesus Christ.
Of course.

3756
02:35:32,960 --> 02:35:34,990
Um,
but what was that movie?

3757
02:35:34,991 --> 02:35:36,970
Go to that seat.
Find that movie that he played in where

3758
02:35:36,971 --> 02:35:38,290
he was born in Kenya.
Sorry.

3759
02:35:38,860 --> 02:35:41,200
Go to his movies.
Find that this one movie that he played

3760
02:35:41,201 --> 02:35:43,510
as a really obscure movie.
It was a really good movie.

3761
02:35:43,810 --> 02:35:45,970
We played a gangster.
He plays a drink.

3762
02:35:45,971 --> 02:35:47,700
Hitman,
I think in one movings.

3763
02:35:47,810 --> 02:35:48,643
Oh,
those his movies.

3764
02:35:49,870 --> 02:35:52,090
Oh Jesus Christ.
Like I want a lot of awards,

3765
02:35:52,180 --> 02:35:53,380
dude.
He's the best.

3766
02:35:53,470 --> 02:35:56,350
Go the filmography right there.
46 movies.

3767
02:35:56,440 --> 02:35:58,960
Jesus Christ.
Yeah,

3768
02:35:58,961 --> 02:36:00,640
he wasn't shutter island.
Yeah,

3769
02:36:00,670 --> 02:36:01,940
keep going.
Keep going.

3770
02:36:02,010 --> 02:36:03,850
See if I can find that movie.
Sexy beast.

3771
02:36:03,851 --> 02:36:06,730
That's it.
To your left there.

3772
02:36:06,731 --> 02:36:07,570
Right there.
Bam.

3773
02:36:07,600 --> 02:36:12,460
It's in 2000 great fucking movie plays a
psychopath and you would go,

3774
02:36:12,461 --> 02:36:13,570
what?
That guy?

3775
02:36:13,640 --> 02:36:16,870
That guy seems like so peaceful.
He fucking knocks it out of the park.

3776
02:36:16,871 --> 02:36:19,060
He's awesome.
So really,

3777
02:36:19,061 --> 02:36:20,560
really crazy movie.
Mad.

3778
02:36:21,250 --> 02:36:23,590
He'd played a fucking complete nut.
It was great.

3779
02:36:23,610 --> 02:36:26,740
Yeah.
I like an actor that can play a villain

3780
02:36:27,310 --> 02:36:29,980
that's plays it so well,
but I'll still hate the actor

3781
02:36:29,981 --> 02:36:31,590
afterwards.
Yeah,

3782
02:36:31,630 --> 02:36:32,463
no,
I know what you mean.

3783
02:36:32,470 --> 02:36:33,970
Yeah.
Yeah.

3784
02:36:34,330 --> 02:36:37,060
Well that's the weird thing about
watching an actor,

3785
02:36:37,061 --> 02:36:38,200
right?
So you're agreeing,

3786
02:36:38,201 --> 02:36:40,850
you know that that's Tom Cruise.
You're agreeing that he's on a space

3787
02:36:40,851 --> 02:36:43,240
ship and he's targeting,
you know,

3788
02:36:43,660 --> 02:36:48,310
you can like the day after tomorrow is
that tomorrow movie because they have to

3789
02:36:48,311 --> 02:36:51,320
mine,
they changed the name to it's day after

3790
02:36:51,321 --> 02:36:53,500
tomorrow and it's like a weird subtitle
on it too,

3791
02:36:54,370 --> 02:36:57,070
which is in my opinion,
like one of the most overlooked science

3792
02:36:57,071 --> 02:36:57,970
fiction movies ever.

3793
02:36:58,950 --> 02:36:59,910
It was a brilliant,
oh no,

3794
02:36:59,911 --> 02:37:02,020
that's a edge it tomorrow.
Tomorrow.

3795
02:37:02,050 --> 02:37:03,490
That's right.
Edge of tomorrow.

3796
02:37:03,520 --> 02:37:04,750
Which one would have to tomorrow?
I was like,

3797
02:37:05,110 --> 02:37:06,280
what did that one?
Yeah,

3798
02:37:06,281 --> 02:37:09,700
that was the ice with the Quaid Fella.
With the Queen Fella.

3799
02:37:09,820 --> 02:37:10,653
Yeah,
that was,

3800
02:37:10,840 --> 02:37:14,260
that was a super bad movie.
That end of the world movie.

3801
02:37:14,261 --> 02:37:16,280
That was so bad.
I love bad movies too.

3802
02:37:16,281 --> 02:37:18,410
Cause then you usually laugh at them all
the day after tomorrow,

3803
02:37:18,411 --> 02:37:19,250
right?
That's what it was called.

3804
02:37:19,430 --> 02:37:20,181
Live,
die,

3805
02:37:20,181 --> 02:37:21,350
repeat.
Oh,

3806
02:37:21,351 --> 02:37:23,480
yeah.
Okay.

3807
02:37:23,720 --> 02:37:25,550
That's a great science fiction movie
now.

3808
02:37:25,760 --> 02:37:30,760
And it is white as fuck white people,
white people,

3809
02:37:32,420 --> 02:37:34,610
oblivion.
I think our eyes Elysium sorry.

3810
02:37:34,760 --> 02:37:35,990
Yeah.
Elysium yeah.

3811
02:37:36,190 --> 02:37:39,110
Uh,
Tom Cruise did that movie edge of

3812
02:37:39,111 --> 02:37:40,850
tomorrow and then he also did a
Bolivian,

3813
02:37:40,851 --> 02:37:42,560
I think like within months of each
other.

3814
02:37:42,920 --> 02:37:43,820
Wow.
Oh yeah.

3815
02:37:43,821 --> 02:37:45,650
They probably were confusing as fuck.
Right.

3816
02:37:46,300 --> 02:37:47,840
They're both science fiction movies.

3817
02:37:47,900 --> 02:37:50,210
Mm hmm.
Oh yeah,

3818
02:37:50,211 --> 02:37:52,480
that's right.
That was a good way too.

3819
02:37:52,940 --> 02:37:53,520
Yeah,
man.

3820
02:37:53,520 --> 02:37:55,250
This,
there's been some good ones.

3821
02:37:55,400 --> 02:37:58,760
But with a guy like Tom Cruise,
like when you watch it,

3822
02:37:58,790 --> 02:38:00,600
you know it's Tom Cruise.
I mean,

3823
02:38:00,601 --> 02:38:02,510
that's a,
it's a weird thing that we do.

3824
02:38:03,340 --> 02:38:04,071
Yeah.
We know.

3825
02:38:04,071 --> 02:38:05,690
That's Morgan Freeman.
There's Morgan Freeman.

3826
02:38:05,720 --> 02:38:08,180
I know it was Morgan Freeman,
but I'm gonna pretend that he's this

3827
02:38:08,181 --> 02:38:11,870
dude who runs this planet and he wants
to talk to Tom Cruise.

3828
02:38:12,790 --> 02:38:13,431
All right,
man.

3829
02:38:13,431 --> 02:38:15,410
I gotta wrap this bitch up.
I gotta get the fuck out of here.

3830
02:38:15,620 --> 02:38:18,230
We're supposed to end earlier.
I had a meeting that I blew off.

3831
02:38:18,260 --> 02:38:18,980
Oh,
no way.

3832
02:38:18,980 --> 02:38:19,521
Yeah.
I'm sorry.

3833
02:38:19,521 --> 02:38:20,780
I didn't mean to make some adjustments
now.

3834
02:38:20,781 --> 02:38:22,580
I didn't realize we were talking so
long.

3835
02:38:22,581 --> 02:38:25,630
I thought it was 1230 and it was a one
30 I didn't mean to crowder.

3836
02:38:25,640 --> 02:38:26,700
Yeah,
it was awesome.

3837
02:38:27,320 --> 02:38:28,700
Good Times.
Congratulations.

3838
02:38:28,730 --> 02:38:31,190
Thank you so much.
It's always awesome having you at the

3839
02:38:31,191 --> 02:38:33,500

3842
02:38:39,830 --> 02:38:41,840
