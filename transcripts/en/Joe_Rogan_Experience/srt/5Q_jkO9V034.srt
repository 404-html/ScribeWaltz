1
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:04,960
Five,
four,

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:06,640
three,
two,

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,440
one.
Live.

4
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,500
And we're live.
Mr Carmichael.

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,120
Hello,
my friend Joe Tomorrow.

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,980
I know a Gemara welcome.
Thank you man.

7
00:00:17,981 --> 00:00:19,510
I know you were coming,
but glad to see you.

8
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:20,461
Me Neither,
man.

9
00:00:20,461 --> 00:00:21,530
He made.
He made me come.

10
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:27,570
Just came by.
I'm going to Joe Rogan and he was like,

11
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:31,940
perfect.
Perfect.

12
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,250
What the fuck is going on man?
What do you have to.

13
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:39,520
I just got an from New York like two
hours ago and now I'm here.

14
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:41,110
I feel real.
I don't know,

15
00:00:41,111 --> 00:00:42,130
I feel like,
uh,

16
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:44,980
you know,
you ever see like a homeless man smoking

17
00:00:44,981 --> 00:00:46,390
a cigarette?
Yeah.

18
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:49,580
And he just feels like real zen and this
is his.

19
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:51,910
That's how.
That's how I feel emotionally right now.

20
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:52,990
Really?
Yeah.

21
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:54,900
Really homeless dude smoking a
cigarette.

22
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:55,810
I.
Weird analogy.

23
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:58,870
I feel it's great.
It's really great.

24
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:01,510
I'm trying to figure that out.
That feeling.

25
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,810
It's like I have everything that I need
right now in your life.

26
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:05,950
Have everything I need.

27
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,110
Yeah.
Well you've been killing it for a long

28
00:01:08,111 --> 00:01:08,711
time,
man.

29
00:01:08,711 --> 00:01:11,140
You know you were killing it when I
wasn't at the store.

30
00:01:11,141 --> 00:01:15,100
I'd heard about you when I was gone.
I had heard about you.

31
00:01:15,101 --> 00:01:16,750
I think our is one that told me about.
Yeah.

32
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,140
Oh yeah.
You know,

33
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,590
and then I found out that spike Lee
directed your specials.

34
00:01:20,591 --> 00:01:23,920
Like what?
Like what the fuck is happening over at

35
00:01:23,921 --> 00:01:28,840
the comedy store
directing comedy specials.

36
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:32,500
That was a fun one because it was like
just such a.

37
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:35,560
immediately I was like,
it has to be in the O and nobody filmed

38
00:01:35,561 --> 00:01:39,310
in the OA and so like getting everybody
to agree to that.

39
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,530
Yeah.
And then because he would spike was

40
00:01:41,531 --> 00:01:44,950
like,
but the main rooms right here so big and

41
00:01:44,951 --> 00:01:45,784
it's,
it was like,

42
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,100
but I don't do the main room.
We'll do our.

43
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,370
Yeah,
the main room is pretty good too.

44
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,700
I used to,
I used to be prejudice against the main

45
00:01:53,701 --> 00:01:54,331
room.
I'd be like,

46
00:01:54,331 --> 00:01:55,180
ah,
it's too big.

47
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:58,450
It's too showy.
It depends on how dirty and grimy.

48
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:03,480
It depends on like the sides of full or
open and what the,

49
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:08,950
the room can change depending on so many
factors of like seeding and whatever.

50
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,320
Just the sound of it.
Well,

51
00:02:11,321 --> 00:02:14,020
the room really changes when it gets
empty late at night.

52
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,350
Like that's a strange room.
I like Brody's doing those midnight

53
00:02:17,351 --> 00:02:19,260
spots.
Those have been some fun spots.

54
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:20,270
The,
it's just one bro.

55
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:24,010
These just
like I used to,

56
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:27,780
Tommy used to make me a follow brody.
Uh,

57
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:28,860
like all the time.
It's,

58
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:32,420
that's such a fun,
interesting thing to do to like.

59
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:37,440
Because what else is left at that point?
Your headspace?

60
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:41,800
Yeah.
It's in there in such a different place

61
00:02:41,801 --> 00:02:45,880
that it's just one of the piece it back
together and figure it out tomorrow.

62
00:02:45,881 --> 00:02:48,040
You get a lot of those freaky spots.
Yeah,

63
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:48,874
man.

64
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,690
The follow Brian Holtzman
like,

65
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,250
well,
he's just so crazy.

66
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,010
He'll say so much crazy shit

67
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,560
that the audience is just like stunned.
Like,

68
00:03:02,561 --> 00:03:05,950
yeah.
It's like Brody Times 20.

69
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:09,610
Rarely ever see holtzman funny as fuck.
Yeah.

70
00:03:09,611 --> 00:03:10,660
I don't.
I don't think I have yet.

71
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:12,430
Oh my God,
Dude.

72
00:03:12,431 --> 00:03:15,460
Holsman said some of the darkest Shit
I've ever seen anybody say onstage.

73
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:18,580
He went on stage at.
Do you remember Susan Smith?

74
00:03:18,581 --> 00:03:22,780
That lady that drowned her kids?
She was a lady that she drowned her

75
00:03:22,781 --> 00:03:25,900
kids.
I forget what the context of it was.

76
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,260
Holtzman went on stage like two days
later.

77
00:03:28,261 --> 00:03:30,580
I was like,
I heard those were bad kids.

78
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:34,630
I heard they sat that close to the TV.
They never put away their blocks.

79
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,360
If fucking spelt their milk,
those kids went up.

80
00:03:37,361 --> 00:03:38,194
He missed.

81
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,650
Well,
when you say that,

82
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,530
maybe I have her,
Brian host 11th.

83
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,240
Mitzi wouldn't let them go on stage.

84
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,960
Oh,
I keep them off stage.

85
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:57,950
She will go out and risk the potential
like riot.

86
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:00,180
Well,
he's a really funny guy and a really

87
00:04:00,181 --> 00:04:03,390
good comp,
but he's never been a professional like

88
00:04:03,391 --> 00:04:05,720
his whole life.
He's been doing comedy forever.

89
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:07,500
When I came to the store in [inaudible],
94,

90
00:04:07,501 --> 00:04:10,740
holtzman was already there and he's
never been a professional.

91
00:04:10,741 --> 00:04:12,720
He's always had a job.
So He's been.

92
00:04:12,721 --> 00:04:15,120
He was a dog catcher.
He was a meter maid,

93
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,990
like a bunch of different shit,
you know,

94
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:20,190
so he's never,
never really branched out.

95
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:24,010
Eleanor was telling me how you fought a
Martin Lawrence's,

96
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:27,450
a bodyguard,
or you can call it that you could say.

97
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:29,510
I would say Martin Lawrence,
his bodyguard,

98
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,520
beat the fuck out of Brian Holtzman.
Martin Lawrence was heckling and hope.

99
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,150
Well Holtmann's onstage.
You seen crazy shit and it's like 10

100
00:04:42,151 --> 00:04:46,750
people in the room and and Martin was
heckling apparently and Brian got off

101
00:04:46,751 --> 00:04:48,810
stage to point out,
but it was Martin Lawrence.

102
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:49,850
He's like,
look,

103
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:52,680
this fucking rich famous motherfuckers
hegland me.

104
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:55,770
Boom.
It gets knocked out.

105
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,620
There was that immediate.
This wasn't even a parking lot.

106
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:02,890
It was a showcase.
Is that what you heard?

107
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:08,810
The stories get twisted story.
Stories get weird after a while,

108
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,453
but yeah,
that was,

109
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,560
those were the dark days,
the comedy store.

110
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,713
That was like,

111
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,940
I want to say that was like,
I don't even know if that was the two

112
00:05:18,941 --> 00:05:19,774
thousands.

113
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:25,590
What is it now?
I haven't really been in like I've kind

114
00:05:25,881 --> 00:05:27,000
of been,
but I like,

115
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:31,500
what is it now like still that place
where you go experiment,

116
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:34,740
try out.
I do

117
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,660
Gemara.
It's actually though I go to see Jamal

118
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,740
was like,
when I go it's usually to like it,

119
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:47,750
like whatever 1:00 AM shit.
It's like great.

120
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,130
I just hit him up and be like,
hey man,

121
00:05:50,131 --> 00:05:52,170
I'm going up.
I'm going to do some crazy shit.

122
00:05:52,171 --> 00:05:53,520
You coming through?
Oh yeah.

123
00:05:53,521 --> 00:05:56,520
I love it.
One o'clock sets.

124
00:05:56,521 --> 00:05:58,310
It's a different.
It's a different.

125
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:01,340
It's experimental.
It's strange.

126
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,130
It's kind of sad.
There's a little sadness.

127
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,050
Perfect.
Yeah.

128
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,380
Oh the sadness is those late night
because you like,

129
00:06:11,381 --> 00:06:13,490
you looking at your watch.
Like why am I not at home?

130
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:14,570
Why am I not asleep?

131
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,330
I remember that feeling my first time
going to the comedy store.

132
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,500
Just being like,
why?

133
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:25,990
Like why am I sad?
Like just like this thing that just

134
00:06:25,991 --> 00:06:27,570
weighs you like it.
I,

135
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:31,600
I,
I remember feeling Kinda like worthless.

136
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,730
No,
just like Kinda like the PR.

137
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:36,580
It just,
it really feels like a ghost is choking

138
00:06:36,581 --> 00:06:37,414
you out.

139
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:43,030
It's like a weird ghost and pick,
pick one

140
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:47,230
89.
This is a lot of ghost in that room.

141
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,390
And they come,
they went,

142
00:06:48,391 --> 00:06:50,230
everyone's gone.
That's when they show up,

143
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,640
you think?
No,

144
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:52,990
no.
I don't think for real.

145
00:06:52,991 --> 00:06:55,720
Like you'll see them,
but you do definitely feel like

146
00:06:55,721 --> 00:06:56,920
weirdness.
Yeah.

147
00:06:56,921 --> 00:06:57,850
No,
there's a weird.

148
00:06:57,851 --> 00:06:59,710
Especially when you bomb,
you get that cold.

149
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,953
Well,
you know,

150
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:10,600
he bombed there too.
Just some classic famous stories about

151
00:07:10,601 --> 00:07:13,540
prior bombing as he was filming live in
the sunset strip.

152
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:14,910
Like some of the Salon,

153
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,550
uh,
had the footage.

154
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:18,660
Oh really?
Yeah.

155
00:07:18,661 --> 00:07:21,930
The uh,
the show Tom that had like the footage

156
00:07:21,931 --> 00:07:23,580
of the,
that show.

157
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:24,511
Oh,
the show.

158
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:26,760
Where was prepping,
like what was getting ready to.

159
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:27,300
Well,
not all,

160
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:31,350
like the show were just didn't go like
to stay with them.

161
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,700
Well they filmed the,
you know,

162
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:35,290
that strip show where he had to come
back the next night and,

163
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:37,350
and like Kinda Redo.
He just had like,

164
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,020
he was just,
he,

165
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,920
he,
you know,

166
00:07:40,921 --> 00:07:45,921
operating from such a place of just like
it was so it had to be honest to him I

167
00:07:47,851 --> 00:07:51,840
think and it had just hadn't gone up in
a while and was on stage and was just

168
00:07:51,841 --> 00:07:55,900
like in the room and just sat in.
It just,

169
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,620
he just sat there was footage is crazy.
Send me that.

170
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,840
Wow.
He's got the footage.

171
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:03,270
Well it's in the dark.
You can see it in a documentary like a

172
00:08:03,271 --> 00:08:04,860
little bit,
but I think it's extended for it.

173
00:08:04,861 --> 00:08:08,130
I haven't seen the extended footage,
if that exists,

174
00:08:08,131 --> 00:08:08,964
but

175
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:13,420
there's some great old cassettes that I
bought from a,

176
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:18,630
like a gas station.
There were a red foxes comedy club.

177
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:24,210
Red Fox had a comedy club and prior
would go up and just fuck around man,

178
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:28,210
just fuck around.
And there was many of them.

179
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,370
I mean there was like seven or eight
recordings.

180
00:08:30,371 --> 00:08:33,430
Mavericks flat.
I think it was right.

181
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:35,530
That was the name of the company.
I think so awful.

182
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:38,140
It was awful.
Like crenshaw or something over there.

183
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:40,090
Like Oh,
where the club was?

184
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:41,260
Yeah.
I don't know.

185
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,980
I got them when I was living in Boston.
I was living in Boston and I found them

186
00:08:44,981 --> 00:08:47,020
like at a gas station there were for
sale.

187
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:49,420
Oh yeah.
And it was crazy because it was like,

188
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:53,260
it was a small crowd.
You could tell it was a small crowd and

189
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:56,100
prior was just fucking man.
He was just,

190
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,550
he was ad libbing.

191
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,800
You could tell that like it wasn't
structured and some of it was really

192
00:09:01,801 --> 00:09:06,330
funny and some of it like kind of fell
flat and you could hear the clink of

193
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,960
glasses and shit in the background.
It was just so real rich,

194
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:14,610
you know,
Richard Pryor back then he was doing

195
00:09:14,611 --> 00:09:19,611
something that it's like he had figured
out a thing that he could do that other

196
00:09:19,981 --> 00:09:21,760
people hadn't figured out.
And that thing was like,

197
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:26,780
just be totally honest and also just
explore ideas on stage in front of

198
00:09:28,771 --> 00:09:30,810
people,
like not even have it mapped out yet.

199
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,630
Just try,
just fuck around and find what's funny

200
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:38,210
and he'd be smoking cigarettes and just
talking and he figured out a way to turn

201
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:42,540
and then you would see it boiled in to
like Richard Pryor live or live in the

202
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:45,660
sunset strip or any of his specials.
You would see it boiled down to this,

203
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,270
doing it for tell,
you know,

204
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:53,470
he performed for television really well.
Um,

205
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:56,110
and that's kind of a,
an element that,

206
00:09:56,111 --> 00:09:59,330
uh,
I think people kind of forget that.

207
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:04,340
Like how well of a it connected with you
watching it at home,

208
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,160
like,
you know,

209
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:11,110
even me 20,
30 years later after it's filmed and

210
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:16,111
just watching it with my dad if he plays
really well here,

211
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,520
you know what I mean?
Like to you,

212
00:10:18,521 --> 00:10:21,700
it's like you can feel how personal and
how honest it is.

213
00:10:21,701 --> 00:10:24,490
And so when it was like boiled down,
it was just,

214
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:27,490
he was also captured really well.
Do you ever see him live?

215
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,140
No.
Prior?

216
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:30,700
Yeah.
How old do you think I am?

217
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:34,130
No,
he was alive doing standup 10 years ago?

218
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,090
Yeah.
Maybe a little bit more maybe 15 years

219
00:10:38,091 --> 00:10:38,980
ago.
But he doesn't,

220
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:43,850
he died.
Maybe it was more than 15 years ago now

221
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:45,500
that I'm thinking about it is you ever
seen him live?

222
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,790
Yeah,
I had um,

223
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:49,700
I had a follow them like five weeks in a
row,

224
00:10:49,701 --> 00:10:50,620
man.
Really Weird.

225
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,090
Like a run in 2005.
He died.

226
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,270
Okay.
So it was more than I thought

227
00:10:55,850 --> 00:11:00,410
he did a run before he died.
It was probably right before then.

228
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:04,610
I actually,
I want to say it was like the late

229
00:11:04,611 --> 00:11:06,150
nineties,
early 2000,

230
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:10,190
somewhere around that he was real sick
and they would have to carry him to the

231
00:11:10,191 --> 00:11:13,880
stage and it would take like five
minutes for him to get to the stage so

232
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:16,610
that he introduced him and the comic
would get out of the way.

233
00:11:16,611 --> 00:11:17,520
And then,
um,

234
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:22,940
a chewy and Maryland Martinez,
his husband would help him,

235
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:25,430
walked the stage.
They would hold onto him,

236
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,260
take him to the stage,
let me take forever.

237
00:11:27,261 --> 00:11:30,470
It was a slow process and they'd get
them and they sit them down and they'd

238
00:11:30,471 --> 00:11:35,471
crank up the mic like this
because his voice was so soft.

239
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,390
Yeah.
And he would do standup,

240
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:42,940
do like 15,
20 minutes and then I would go on after

241
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,740
every,
almost every time it would be me and

242
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:49,010
just eat shit.
Shit.

243
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,010
First of all,
nobody

244
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:56,500
knew who I was.
And second of all they just saw Richard

245
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,770
Pryor and they're sad because he's
fading away.

246
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:01,510
You're right in front of everybody.
Yeah.

247
00:12:01,511 --> 00:12:06,220
It's an interesting feeling like never
before it was like a British type in

248
00:12:06,221 --> 00:12:09,910
admission,
been needed more British type

249
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,650
information.
You don't like where it's just like,

250
00:12:11,651 --> 00:12:13,720
all right,
which prior is gone and uh,

251
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,120
you know,
15 minutes people go smoke cigarettes,

252
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,030
come back.
What year did you start doing standup?

253
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:20,340
A 2008.
Yeah.

254
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:23,260
So you missed it.
Did you go to the clubs at all before

255
00:12:23,261 --> 00:12:25,390
then to look around A.
No.

256
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:28,020
Well,
two nights before.

257
00:12:28,021 --> 00:12:32,100
My first two nights,
two nights before our first time I went

258
00:12:32,101 --> 00:12:35,160
to the comedy store.
Wow.

259
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:40,640
Did you first day in la?
My first day in La I saw the whole show.

260
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,820
Nine to 2:00 AM.
Wow.

261
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:46,890
You sat through the whole show,
the whole show.

262
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,210
Did the open mic that Sunday.

263
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:50,343
Whoa.

264
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:52,570
That's an experience man.
The,

265
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:53,940
the people that do that,
man,

266
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:56,140
that's like running an ultra marathon,
like,

267
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,890
no,
but I am to,

268
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,010
to.
It's interesting.

269
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:00,960
I can watch,
I can watch it,

270
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:04,400
you know,
I can consume a,

271
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:09,150
like a high volume of it in,
in a lot of cases.

272
00:13:09,151 --> 00:13:09,710
Like,
you know,

273
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:12,210
I'm,
I've always been interested in like

274
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,340
whatever people are talking about,
you know,

275
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:16,470
like,
and it was just an interesting sampler.

276
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,333
Like,
all right,

277
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,290
what's fascinating about the store,
this,

278
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:24,220
the 15 minute blocks that you're seeing
these completely different viewpoints,

279
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:28,060
15 minute chunks.
So it's like if you sit there for long

280
00:13:28,061 --> 00:13:30,250
enough,
you sit there for a couple of hours and

281
00:13:30,251 --> 00:13:32,950
you watched that many different people,
you want to eight different people go

282
00:13:32,951 --> 00:13:33,400
up.
It's like,

283
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,780
it's very weird.
Yeah,

284
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:41,150
the strength of it,
I think for like what standup is

285
00:13:41,971 --> 00:13:45,240
especially like right now,
what it helps is it allows you to think

286
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:48,240
of yourself in context.
Um,

287
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,390
and,
and that's Kinda,

288
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,260
that's best more important now than
ever.

289
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:57,770
Especially what stand up if you're on
and you're competing against the 3000

290
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,920
other specials that came out this way,
right?

291
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,150
It's in context of,
you know,

292
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:09,210
kind of mass consumption.
So if you go into a,

293
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,220
you know,
in the middle of a marathon,

294
00:14:11,221 --> 00:14:12,450
so you're going up in the,
oh,

295
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:17,451
are in the middle of a show and they saw
eight comics for you.

296
00:14:17,911 --> 00:14:20,900
They'll see nine after you or whatever,
right.

297
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:26,420
You have to like kind of sketch a place
in their minds in context of everything

298
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:31,260
else that they saw that night.
So it's really important.

299
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,440
Are you going like,
are you going like,

300
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:34,400
okay,
so what happened?

301
00:14:34,401 --> 00:14:35,420
They said,
well no,

302
00:14:35,421 --> 00:14:36,810
you can't do that because they,
you know,

303
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,010
it,
it,

304
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,020
it,
it forces you.

305
00:14:39,021 --> 00:14:40,830
It's not saying like,
you know,

306
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:45,110
it's not saying change who you are.
I think it makes them more dynamic

307
00:14:45,111 --> 00:14:50,111
version of who you are because you have
to be memorable in the context of all of

308
00:14:50,361 --> 00:14:52,360
these people and these different styles.

309
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,780
It also,
you know,

310
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:57,650
I think what you do because you're
whatever you make and you release into

311
00:14:57,651 --> 00:14:59,750
the world,
you are also releasing it in the context

312
00:14:59,751 --> 00:15:03,170
of other are that people are consuming.
Right?

313
00:15:03,171 --> 00:15:05,930
So like even if you release your standup
album,

314
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,330
you know,
a lot of times people will buy stand up

315
00:15:08,331 --> 00:15:10,730
albums by stand up albums,
you know,

316
00:15:10,731 --> 00:15:15,110
and so they listened to you in context
of the other standup albums that you

317
00:15:15,111 --> 00:15:17,750
have.
It's a strong comparison.

318
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:22,751
Culture stand has right like hip hop
where it's always in relation.

319
00:15:24,111 --> 00:15:26,750
It's not,
this is my favorite rapper is this is

320
00:15:26,751 --> 00:15:31,751
better than that wrapper
and comedians and consumers of it,

321
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,990
you know,
it's a lot of association so it's like

322
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:41,290
you should force you to be you
specifically you that's needed more than

323
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:44,280
ever before.
You know,

324
00:15:44,281 --> 00:15:47,720
like,
like you need to be yourself completely

325
00:15:47,721 --> 00:15:52,100
or if you're a character,
that character needs to be hammered the

326
00:15:52,101 --> 00:15:52,934
fuck down.

327
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:55,830
Yeah.
And who you are changes depending upon

328
00:15:55,831 --> 00:15:57,690
your environment.
That's one of the things about the

329
00:15:57,691 --> 00:15:59,940
store,
like since I've come back to the store,

330
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,150
it's tightened me up,
it's made me better coming back to the

331
00:16:03,151 --> 00:16:05,970
store because it's like being in that
environment,

332
00:16:05,971 --> 00:16:09,120
being in that pressure cooker with
around all these other creative people

333
00:16:09,121 --> 00:16:10,590
and everybody's constantly getting after
it.

334
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:11,770
Yeah,
no,

335
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:13,300
it's great.
It's a really good,

336
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:19,240
a kind of artist's colony at his best.
It can operate like that.

337
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,310
You can just kind of run them on his
best.

338
00:16:21,311 --> 00:16:26,311
Like I remember nights where we would
run in between rooms even before getting

339
00:16:27,251 --> 00:16:30,040
spot.
It's just to go see each,

340
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:30,940
you know,
each room,

341
00:16:30,941 --> 00:16:34,520
different comedians and you just kind of
absorb it and watch it and get excited.

342
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:36,120
Yeah.
You could do three different sets in

343
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:37,890
that place and have three different
universes.

344
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,410
Like you're in the belly room.
Then you're in the main room and the,

345
00:16:40,411 --> 00:16:41,880
oh,
are those three different world?

346
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:44,790
There really are three completely
different entities.

347
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,520
It changes people too.
Like that's one of the reasons why

348
00:16:47,521 --> 00:16:50,280
Kennison became who he was because he
was doing those late night spots.

349
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,170
He was doing those same spots at
Holtzman gets those,

350
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:56,790
those late spots and he just had to
capture people's attention.

351
00:16:56,791 --> 00:17:00,630
So He'd just go out there screaming.
I mean they're really,

352
00:17:00,631 --> 00:17:01,830
I mean he,
you know,

353
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:07,070
speaking of existing in context of area,
he is the light that is a style that's

354
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:09,870
just completely created from
frustration.

355
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,220
Yeah.
Other,

356
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:14,220
other,
other comedians create sim and it's

357
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:16,870
other comedians and ex wives,
you know,

358
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:19,040
I mean he,
he had like,

359
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:21,750
I mean everybody had ex wife jokes,
you know,

360
00:17:21,751 --> 00:17:24,300
there was a lot of that.
Take my wife please,

361
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:25,230
you know,
that kind of shit.

362
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,890
There was a lot of wife jokes and ex
wife jokes,

363
00:17:28,891 --> 00:17:33,030
but Kennison what he did was just
screaming,

364
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,141
you know,
it was just,

365
00:17:34,141 --> 00:17:37,680
it was just raw and you looked at them,
this is a little fat balding guy,

366
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:38,521
and you're like,
oh yeah,

367
00:17:38,521 --> 00:17:42,120
he probably had a real rough time of it.
Will you just believe it was hatred?

368
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:46,980
Remember that video is watching Sam
Kennison.

369
00:17:46,981 --> 00:17:50,310
He was like really late night and um,
maybe it was like 1:00

370
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:52,830
in the morning and he was like,
every comment just gets,

371
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:57,450
just gets wires.
Well,

372
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:59,610
he also came from a,
he was a preacher,

373
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:05,010
so he had this ability to just rant and
rave from project and he knew the

374
00:18:05,011 --> 00:18:06,640
retina.
Many knew that the fucking,

375
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:10,530
he had this thing that he would do that.
It was very much like,

376
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,950
like a revival tent,
like one of those tent preachers.

377
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,890
I remember watching them on a married
with children with my dad.

378
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,440
That's my personal.
It is brilliant on their team.

379
00:18:19,441 --> 00:18:22,540
Wasn't he on a show where he played like
someone's conscious?

380
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,850
Oh yeah,
him on the shoulder.

381
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,180
Damn Jamie,
how'd you pull that reference?

382
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:31,500
Used to watch that show.
Herman's head.

383
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,770
Yeah.
Yeah.

384
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:36,750
It's funny how you discovered people
like you see them on married with

385
00:18:36,751 --> 00:18:40,480
children and like he shot a wall.
What shot?

386
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,680
They fucking fix the sign at the comedy
store.

387
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,930
I was so depressed when I came back.
I'm like,

388
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:48,330
oh,
that fixed the kinison whole.

389
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:51,060
Why would you fix the bullet hole?
He shot.

390
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:54,720
Shot a hole through the fucking sign in
the parking lot.

391
00:18:54,721 --> 00:18:57,030
You know that sign that's near the back
walkway?

392
00:18:57,031 --> 00:19:01,890
The one that you know in the corner be a
bullet hole in the back of that thing.

393
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:03,120
They fixed it.
Oh,

394
00:19:03,121 --> 00:19:05,040
it's not there anymore.
They fixed him.

395
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:07,280
Why did he do it?
Because he's crazy.

396
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,610
Oh,
he had a gun.

397
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,740
I think it was him and dice.
We're in some sort of a fight.

398
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,220
He pulled out a gun and he shot the
sign.

399
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,810
He tried to shoot dice.
I'm like,

400
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,880
no.
I think he just wanted to know that he

401
00:19:17,881 --> 00:19:21,650
would shoot them all coked out of his
legs.

402
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,560
Preacher,
by the way,

403
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,740
that sounds like the store.
It wasn't.

404
00:19:25,741 --> 00:19:26,280
Herman said.
No,

405
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,590
it was not.
That was under the same time the show is

406
00:19:28,591 --> 00:19:31,740
called Charlie Hoover.
Really?

407
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:33,270
Yeah.
Wow.

408
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:36,720
I remember him standing on a show.
I remember the image of it.

409
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:39,960
He was like the devil conscience type
character.

410
00:19:39,961 --> 00:19:42,840
Right?
Is that what it was to matheson?

411
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,660
Oh Wow.
What do that.

412
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:47,010
Is it and Tim Matheson,
the guy from animal house,

413
00:19:47,011 --> 00:19:47,844
right.

414
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:52,380
I think why I confused it.
Herman said had four people in his head

415
00:19:52,381 --> 00:19:57,381
and
they don't even do shit like this no

416
00:19:58,351 --> 00:20:00,220
more,
you know,

417
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:05,370
for good reason.
There's a reason we're scrambling for

418
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:09,810
the name they have for him with Alex
Jones.

419
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,210
Look those back to those images you just
had.

420
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:15,360
Go back to the images and then scroll
down.

421
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:16,460
Scroll down.
Oh,

422
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:19,050
look,
Alex Jones is in the middle of that.

423
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,680
That's not even kinison.
Wow,

424
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,580
that's Alex.
Wow.

425
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:29,250
Someone's comparison.
That was a great headshot.

426
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:31,720
Him screaming.
No,

427
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,633
he was,
uh,

428
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,820
he's the guy that got me into comedy
really in a lot of ways.

429
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:38,850
Cocaine,
Sam kinison family entertainment.

430
00:20:38,851 --> 00:20:41,430
Our.
Yeah.

431
00:20:41,431 --> 00:20:43,920
He got me into comedy because I thought
Comedians were.

432
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,080
I thought it was like people who go on
the tonight show and they have their

433
00:20:47,081 --> 00:20:47,980
sleeves rolled up,
you

434
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:48,940
know,
you ever notice.

435
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,850
Here's the crazy thing,
folks like that.

436
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:54,610
I enjoyed watching that,
but it never seemed like me.

437
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,510
I couldn't,
I couldn't see myself doing it.

438
00:20:56,970 --> 00:21:01,560
People got to stop doing that.
They got to stop doing that.

439
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:06,890
Like why are you doing the tonight show
set in your Kobe's not even they blocked

440
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:13,990
is so fucking disrespectful.
They block shoot these things we use

441
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,000
like,
like it's,

442
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:18,330
they'll do like 10 comedians at a time
and he's not even there and they like

443
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:21,280
throw to it as if,
you know,

444
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:23,950
like he's,
it's the rudest thing I've ever heard

445
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:29,220
and the fact that comedians still go on
the show and would still do it is insane

446
00:21:30,371 --> 00:21:31,360
to me.
Wow.

447
00:21:31,361 --> 00:21:32,950
I didn't know that.
That's insane to me.

448
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:36,730
So how many they do in around have I
heard like 10?

449
00:21:36,731 --> 00:21:38,740
I could get the number wrong,
but he's not there.

450
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,100
It's not,
you know,

451
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:43,900
you're just doing like this show in
front of this audience in the studio and

452
00:21:43,901 --> 00:21:47,470
pretends to throw the yellow arrows to
you like you're there and it's like this

453
00:21:47,471 --> 00:21:49,170
thing that's like,
there's nothing,

454
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,440
they're not.
Well,

455
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:51,950
it's again man,
like,

456
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:54,990
but it's on,
it's on us as much as it's like,

457
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,830
you know,
of course they're going to do that.

458
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,810
They're going to do that to any,
you know,

459
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:03,400
any John Rowe entertainment that would
allow such a thing to happen,

460
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,940
they will do it to you.
Right?

461
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:07,270
You know,
they're not going to do Rhianna's doing,

462
00:22:07,271 --> 00:22:09,070
uh,
these,

463
00:22:09,071 --> 00:22:12,100
these things are so contrived.
Like it's the same set.

464
00:22:12,101 --> 00:22:13,510
You come out in front of the same
curtain.

465
00:22:13,511 --> 00:22:17,290
People put on the same outfit that they
didn't wear yesterday and would never

466
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:20,980
wear again tomorrow.
And they come out and they pretend to be

467
00:22:20,981 --> 00:22:23,320
a comedian from 1993.

468
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:27,940
And so,
who the fuck are you?

469
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:32,950
Who the fuck are you?
What are you fucking doing for a set to

470
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:36,170
get passed around to a couple of agents
that want to come see you?

471
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:40,060
Who Cares?
I was talking to the avant about this.

472
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:43,570
We were talking,
we were talking about like whether it's

473
00:22:43,571 --> 00:22:45,650
worth it being on one of those shows.
No,

474
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,593
no,
it's never.

475
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,850
It's never worth it.
It's never worth it.

476
00:22:48,851 --> 00:22:50,890
Capturing yourself,
not as yourself.

477
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:54,880
It's a waste of your time.
Used to be worth something.

478
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:57,640
This is why it's confusing because there
was no venues before.

479
00:22:57,641 --> 00:22:59,770
So when Johnny Carson would have you on
the tonight show.

480
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,740
Yeah,
yeah.

481
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:02,390
No,
and that was a listening.

482
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:07,030
It served its purpose.
It was very important at the time it was

483
00:23:07,031 --> 00:23:12,031
an outlet where there weren't a lot of
outlets and now those types of fuck are

484
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:12,920
we doing?

485
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,760
Yeah.
Especially unless it's like know with

486
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,530
that said,
you know,

487
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:21,040
Kimmel built,
he built like a club,

488
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:25,780
like to enhance the audience,
travel from the studio to the club and

489
00:23:25,781 --> 00:23:27,250
the comedians would do it there and it
was like,

490
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,870
oh,
that's like an effort.

491
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,090
You know what I mean?
Like an effort to create.

492
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,370
Yeah.
It was like a space,

493
00:23:33,371 --> 00:23:35,330
a separate studio that like,
you know,

494
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:37,550
I believe this will do it.
I don't know if I've seen like a Kennel

495
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:40,780
set sand upset recently,
but uh,

496
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,510
but,
but the,

497
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:43,180
there was like an effort,
you know,

498
00:23:43,181 --> 00:23:46,000
I've always really appreciated that.
Like,

499
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,180
like,
like,

500
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:50,690
you know,
at least try like I don't know,

501
00:23:50,691 --> 00:23:54,140
just try.
There are too many options for comedians

502
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:57,950
to go through the same filter of
capturing themselves,

503
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:00,590
uh,
in a way that's not authentic to them.

504
00:24:00,591 --> 00:24:02,810
So you're saying that if I go on called
bear,

505
00:24:02,811 --> 00:24:05,930
I should do with my shirt off.
If you want to have his shirt off,

506
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,670
it has a purpose.
You know what I mean?

507
00:24:07,671 --> 00:24:08,580
Like,
like you should,

508
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:12,980
you should do it.
I do have regular set in the belly room.

509
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,730
Well,
I mean because it's like,

510
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:20,480
you know,
if standup is art,

511
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:21,973
right?
If it's,

512
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:27,020
if it is an art form then it's supposed
to be like the medium is supposed to

513
00:24:27,021 --> 00:24:30,320
come to the artist.
Not the other way around,

514
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:33,320
you know,
because even even on those same shows,

515
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:36,470
you know,
if you see a live music performance,

516
00:24:36,471 --> 00:24:39,650
like the stagings different,
it's specific to the audience,

517
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,470
you know,
and in the context of a show in a black

518
00:24:42,471 --> 00:24:46,460
production and you have this space,
they fill it in the way that makes sense

519
00:24:46,461 --> 00:24:50,830
to the artist and then it's like,
stand up.

520
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,350
It was just like,
you could just go through a slide show.

521
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,430
Just the exact same think,
you know,

522
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,200
it's,
I guess when the music

523
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:00,610
artists gets on Colbert,
one of those shows,

524
00:25:00,611 --> 00:25:02,230
they're already kind of famous,
right?

525
00:25:02,231 --> 00:25:05,500
They already have an album out and when
to stand up gets on those shows.

526
00:25:05,501 --> 00:25:09,250
They're trying to get seen come up.
Like maybe you don't have a special yet.

527
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:13,060
Maybe you just use showcased and they
picked a few people.

528
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,340
You've done any of it yet.
Don't do any of those.

529
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:17,580
Oh,
specific reason.

530
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:21,040
Yeah.
I never liked it.

531
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,910
I remember once on like,
uh,

532
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,990
I,
I was gonna do letterman while Letterman

533
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:29,740
was on Letterman and I remember sending
a,

534
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,380
a,
a set in or whatever,

535
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,570
and they responded was like,
okay,

536
00:25:34,571 --> 00:25:35,410
you know,
we could do it,

537
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:40,620
but could he do his jokes in a more
traditional setup punchline format?

538
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:43,180
And I remember just like email them
back,

539
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:45,820
well,
I'll just do it when I'm famous.

540
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:52,330
I'm just not going to listen to this
bullshit.

541
00:25:52,331 --> 00:25:53,860
No people,
they change.

542
00:25:53,861 --> 00:25:56,470
That's the other thing they change.
Again,

543
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:00,580
compare yourself to a musician.
Imagine you're a musician going on and

544
00:26:00,581 --> 00:26:01,630
they're like,
we liked the song,

545
00:26:01,631 --> 00:26:03,580
but cut the bridge,
come first,

546
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,830
and then you do the,
you will be like,

547
00:26:05,831 --> 00:26:07,780
go fuck yourself.
Right?

548
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:12,510
And the comedians allow like you can't
say pop tart if you say pop.

549
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:16,750
Exactly.
Comedians allow a Lotta Shit to say

550
00:26:16,751 --> 00:26:19,960
pastry pastry,
but that doesn't make any sense.

551
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:24,580
We just trying to hit the road drive.
Toaster strudel is trying to hit the

552
00:26:24,581 --> 00:26:25,660
road right now.
I'm in.

553
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:29,440
Do you man
do

554
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,580
it.
Even back in the day,

555
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,140
it didn't make any sense to me.
They would go,

556
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:34,480
you should put together a five minute
set for the tonight show,

557
00:26:34,481 --> 00:26:37,360
and I'd be like,
I don't want to do it,

558
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:38,680
and they're like,
you should do it.

559
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:40,030
Like it's,
it's good exposure.

560
00:26:40,031 --> 00:26:42,130
This is like the fucking nineties.
Right.

561
00:26:42,131 --> 00:26:43,800
When it actually probably meant I was
like,

562
00:26:43,801 --> 00:26:45,990
I don't,
I don't see it happening.

563
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:50,310
I'm not doing a not stand up.
You're,

564
00:26:50,311 --> 00:26:51,144
you're,
you're,

565
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:56,330
you're taking a little piece of standup.
Like a short set is 15 minutes and in 15

566
00:26:56,791 --> 00:26:59,310
minutes I might cover two concepts.
You know,

567
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:04,140
any time I go over things like I get
thorough if I'm,

568
00:27:04,141 --> 00:27:07,230
if I'm talking about a subject,
I get involved in that subject.

569
00:27:07,231 --> 00:27:09,630
I want to,
I want to bring people on a journey and

570
00:27:09,631 --> 00:27:11,160
I also want to be able to set them up.

571
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:15,120
I want to be able to explain how I think
about things so that by the time I get

572
00:27:15,121 --> 00:27:17,820
to something controversial,
they already have a sense of how I

573
00:27:17,821 --> 00:27:20,580
approach things.
You can't do that in five minutes,

574
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,820
in five minutes.
You just got to just get into it and

575
00:27:23,821 --> 00:27:26,880
it's,
it's a very condensed,

576
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:29,940
homogenized version of who you really
are.

577
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:33,120
Man.
We'll just do a late night spot.

578
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:37,140
Little five minute setup and leave just
to set up.

579
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,470
Just to set up this shake.
Yeah.

580
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:43,440
I remember I saw Louis do one Louis ck
did one,

581
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:48,300
one of those letterman or tonight show
or something like that and I was like,

582
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,790
God,
he shouldn't even do this.

583
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:53,190
It's not.
It's such a.

584
00:27:53,191 --> 00:27:55,800
not a good representation of what he's
capable of.

585
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,030
Well,
some people are like,

586
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:59,830
Jerry Seinfeld should do.
Yeah.

587
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:02,340
That he should absolutely do that.
Yeah.

588
00:28:02,341 --> 00:28:03,190
He could do it.
When he does,

589
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:08,430
he does.
I love Jerry's a tonight show sets.

590
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:11,340
Yeah.
And his like his makes sense.

591
00:28:11,341 --> 00:28:12,210
Yeah,
it makes sense.

592
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,210
It makes sense.
It's like perfect for and it's like,

593
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,890
it translates very,
very well.

594
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:19,090
Well,
when I watched those shows today,

595
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:21,550
I'm like,
why are they still a thing when I see a

596
00:28:21,551 --> 00:28:24,430
late night show and no disrespect
anybody who hosts a late night show,

597
00:28:24,431 --> 00:28:27,850
but to me it's like,
it's like they took a boat and try to

598
00:28:27,851 --> 00:28:29,940
turn into a plane.
Oh,

599
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,860
like,
Hey America,

600
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:35,370
it's in 2018,
but let's pretend it's not there when be

601
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:37,180
right back with a commercial.
Hey,

602
00:28:37,181 --> 00:28:40,820
we're going to have commercials,
commercials the thing,

603
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:43,480
but today everybody watches Hbo and
Netflix.

604
00:28:43,481 --> 00:28:44,890
Like,
what am I doing here?

605
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:46,690
Sitting through a fucking commercial.

606
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:52,080
I'm may be weird.
I like because I actually,

607
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:55,450
I enjoy advertising to do.
Yeah.

608
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,790
Yeah.
I like a lot.

609
00:28:56,791 --> 00:29:01,791
I'll stare at like billboards or watch
commercials have watch like,

610
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:04,200
oh,
because I do think it,

611
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:09,290
it speaks to what a,
like America thinks we are as a culture.

612
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:16,320
You know what I mean?
It speaks to what they think it is

613
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:18,030
appealing and what they think is gonna
work.

614
00:29:18,031 --> 00:29:19,480
And so in a sense,
it's like,

615
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:22,020
like in a way,
in the same sense,

616
00:29:22,021 --> 00:29:26,330
like you can gauge a lot from a person
by the types of questions they ask you,

617
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,770
you know,
you engage a lot from like even a

618
00:29:28,771 --> 00:29:32,610
climate by the type of commercials what
they feel is because they're trying to

619
00:29:32,611 --> 00:29:34,560
appeal to everybody.
So this is what they're saying.

620
00:29:34,561 --> 00:29:37,620
This is what we think everybody is
thinking right now,

621
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,080
you know,
or how everyone feels or what they want.

622
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,520
And uh,
but I,

623
00:29:41,521 --> 00:29:44,650
I love,
like I'll watch it and even like the

624
00:29:44,651 --> 00:29:46,080
tonight show in those,
um,

625
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:47,650
these things.
I mean,

626
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:48,730
look,
you know,

627
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:52,420
anything in function at its best is fun.
It's just,

628
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,700
you know,
the,

629
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:57,850
where it hits a wall and just what we're
saying about comedy and what we're

630
00:29:57,851 --> 00:30:01,090
saying about a lot of things is like
when a thing tries to be something that

631
00:30:01,091 --> 00:30:02,030
it's not,
you know,

632
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:06,760
when it feels like these late night
shows when they're just doing fun things

633
00:30:06,761 --> 00:30:08,860
that they think are fun and interesting.
I love,

634
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:11,740
you know,
Kim will always,

635
00:30:11,741 --> 00:30:16,120
every year does like the parents to tell
the kids that know Halloween that they

636
00:30:16,121 --> 00:30:19,060
ate all the Halloween candy and the kids
reactions and stuff.

637
00:30:19,061 --> 00:30:23,120
Like I eat that stuff up.
I love that you're going to be fun.

638
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:24,490
But,
but like when it,

639
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:26,980
you know,
when shows pretend to be,

640
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,150
you know,
19,

641
00:30:28,151 --> 00:30:32,070
89.
It's just like when comedians pretending

642
00:30:32,071 --> 00:30:34,280
to be of a different era of pretend to
it,

643
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:37,690
it just feels false and I think that's
where you check out.

644
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:40,710
Yeah.
It's just unnecessary at this point,

645
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:43,110
you know,
because of the Internet,

646
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:46,360
you just have too many other venues.
Yeah.

647
00:30:46,361 --> 00:30:47,670
Well yeah.
It's a lot of options.

648
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:50,210
Yeah.
A lot of options and the vent,

649
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,710
like watching things on the internet is
so much more satisfying.

650
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:56,130
It's like watching a comic on a podcast,
you're going to get this chance to

651
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,810
chance to see who the fuck they really
are.

652
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:02,610
Sort of some weird set in front of some
audience that got shipped in from

653
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:04,620
Burbank and they got applause.
Signs and everything.

654
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,820
It's very surreal when you go to a live
taping and you watch that.

655
00:31:08,821 --> 00:31:09,840
It's really surreal.

656
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,340
Oh,
it's very like,

657
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,470
and I'll sit at I,
I,

658
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,410
I have like,
you know,

659
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,560
it's always,
I have weird,

660
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:24,950
a late night thing because I like,
I'm bad at being like the,

661
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:29,490
you know,
celebrity type of thing.

662
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,370
Like I'm just in it and just like
looking at it and when the crowd is

663
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:36,990
giving an unnatural reaction to things
is just like,

664
00:31:36,991 --> 00:31:37,710
what do you.

665
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:39,070
Right.
Too introspective.

666
00:31:39,071 --> 00:31:40,620
You're not going to just dive into the
fake.

667
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:41,561
I'm like,
hey,

668
00:31:41,561 --> 00:31:42,730
no,
hey bro,

669
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:47,160
what are we doing for real?
Is this,

670
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,670
what is this like,
what do you,

671
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:53,520
is this rewarding for you
blah side.

672
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:57,520
Everybody do.
What do we doing to the uncomfortable

673
00:31:57,521 --> 00:32:00,760
moment?
This is where we'll be right back to

674
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:02,020
you.
Thank you.

675
00:32:02,021 --> 00:32:03,760
We'll be right back.
That will be right back.

676
00:32:03,761 --> 00:32:05,650
Shit like,
yeah,

677
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,930
where are you going?
They put

678
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:12,400
those commercials in later.
Just keep rolling.

679
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:16,510
Can we do and we'll be right back.
It's strange,

680
00:32:16,511 --> 00:32:20,440
man.
The advertisement model of shoving an ad

681
00:32:20,441 --> 00:32:23,470
in every 15 minutes to shove in a series
of ads in.

682
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:25,450
Yeah.
How the fuck did they ever do that?

683
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,333
Like,

684
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,380
well,
I mean look,

685
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:31,340
you know,
the unfortunate reality or fortunate Rio

686
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:35,590
I guess depends on what company you work
for is a.

687
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,620
I mean that's,
it's an advertiser's medium.

688
00:32:38,621 --> 00:32:39,454
Right.
And

689
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:43,010
they'll find a way to put the
commercials that even with the Internet,

690
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:47,360
youtube becomes traditional television.
They.

691
00:32:47,361 --> 00:32:49,910
Oh,
this internet commercials are longer

692
00:32:49,911 --> 00:32:52,370
than the TV commercial.
Maybe two minutes.

693
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:54,980
You can skip them.
Do you get a two minute ones now?

694
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:57,350
I don't think I like it.
Don't they got like minute to minute.

695
00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:00,950
You know,
I get excited when I see a 15 second one

696
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:01,973
was like,
oh man.

697
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:05,920
So we're gonna just sit here going to
sit through Ron Howard's masterclass

698
00:33:05,921 --> 00:33:06,580
again.
Huh?

699
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:09,620
But did even sometimes you'd be like,
damn this is too long.

700
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:14,630
Even if it's 15 seconds.
But sometimes I'll look it up.

701
00:33:14,631 --> 00:33:19,140
Commercials and I hate having to watch a
commercial to watch a commercial or like

702
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,270
some type of.
You know what I mean?

703
00:33:20,271 --> 00:33:22,760
Like some type of ad or like a trailer
to something and I'm like,

704
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:25,070
oh,
now I have to sit through this trailer

705
00:33:25,071 --> 00:33:26,640
to watch the trailer that I'm.

706
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:28,560
The commercial does kind of show you
what,

707
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:31,250
what they think the culture is about
right now.

708
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:32,001
Yeah.
Yeah.

709
00:33:32,001 --> 00:33:33,680
What they think people are interested in
right now.

710
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:35,870
Like what,
what?

711
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,240
Uh,
a real manipulative,

712
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:41,670
mainstream version of what the average
think,

713
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,930
think depressed too.
Well,

714
00:33:44,931 --> 00:33:46,760
a lot of people are.
You're not depressed.

715
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:47,833
No,
I'm good

716
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:55,060
bastard body going onstage shirtless.
Some people are,

717
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:56,900
you know,
a lot of people are like,

718
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,870
what percentage do you think,
I mean it's probably more than 20

719
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:03,380
percent of Americans are depressed.
Let's just,

720
00:34:03,381 --> 00:34:05,390
Hey,
guess what?

721
00:34:05,391 --> 00:34:07,760
A recent poll shows.
It's not going to give us a real good

722
00:34:07,761 --> 00:34:10,070
idea,
but I'll say 20 percent,

723
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:12,260
20 percent of Americans suffer from
depression.

724
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:14,590
What do you think?
A form of the.

725
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:18,500
Or are we saying specifically depression
and we saying like mental

726
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:23,380
illness,
depression.

727
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,210
It is define.
Yeah.

728
00:34:25,211 --> 00:34:28,470
Yeah,
because I'm just saying it.

729
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:31,850
It's the reason it's hard to quantify
because it's like,

730
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:37,330
it also is a thing that comes in phases
or post event specific like depression.

731
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,630
You know what I mean?
That's why I'm just wondering how we're

732
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:44,120
and I,
I can't believe it's not as easy as man

733
00:34:44,121 --> 00:34:47,330
get over that shit.
Like I can't believe it's not,

734
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:50,800
but it's not.
Yeah,

735
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:52,580
that's how I could.
Oh Shit.

736
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:57,810
Fuck it.
You know exactly.

737
00:34:57,890 --> 00:34:59,570
Like it's hard to like.
It's like,

738
00:34:59,571 --> 00:35:00,590
wow,
you've got a cancer,

739
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:01,790
get over it.
Like,

740
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:05,150
man my man.
Oh you mean a tumor?

741
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:08,270
You mean like specifically like event
based thing.

742
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:13,020
Like if something has happened that
sparks like sadness,

743
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:18,220
I forget that there's more than one
reason to be depressed to white,

744
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:21,680
like six point seven percent.
Six,

745
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,080
16 point 2 million adults in United
States.

746
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,960
Quick Equaling six point seven percent
of all adults in the country who have

747
00:35:26,961 --> 00:35:29,840
experienced a major depressive episode
in the last year.

748
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:35,030
10 point 3 million US adults experience
in episode that resulted in severe

749
00:35:35,031 --> 00:35:37,320
impairment in the last year.
Wow.

750
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,540
Fifty percent of all people

751
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:43,080
well diagnosed with depression are also
diagnosed with an anxiety disorder.

752
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:46,320
It's estimated that 15 percent of the
adult population will experience

753
00:35:46,321 --> 00:35:47,970
depression at some point in their
lifetime,

754
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,550
like posts.
But what does that mean though?

755
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:53,460
Like if your dog dies was.
I mean you lose a job,

756
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:54,750
girlfriend breaks up with you.

757
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:55,790
Yeah,
yeah.

758
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:59,560
Blog posts I went through,
I remember going through like a real

759
00:35:59,561 --> 00:36:03,940
kind of dark period after losing a
friend like happened twice.

760
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,590
It just like.
And,

761
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:09,960
and I'm very much so I,
I get the Gemara and mentality of just

762
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:10,920
like,
I don't know,

763
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,380
Niggas just get over that shit,
but like,

764
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:16,100
but is that depression?
Uh,

765
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:18,460
right.
That's a good question.

766
00:36:18,461 --> 00:36:20,860
Yeah.
I don't know clinically like where the

767
00:36:20,861 --> 00:36:24,550
line is as humans.
Like isn't it just highs and lows?

768
00:36:24,551 --> 00:36:26,580
Highs and lows deal with this.
Don't deal with to,

769
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:27,490
you know,
deal with that.

770
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:31,330
They what the happiness.
It's highs and lows but it's just your

771
00:36:31,331 --> 00:36:34,680
expectation of what the next phases,
like your expectation.

772
00:36:34,681 --> 00:36:39,190
Like it's all legitimate issues that
people have with mental problems.

773
00:36:39,191 --> 00:36:41,190
Their brain doesn't produce hormones.
Yes.

774
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:46,320
There's people that are legit.
Serotonin and dopamine issues tomorrow.

775
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:49,630
I'm so ignorant.
Suicide hotline,

776
00:36:49,631 --> 00:36:54,040
like Nigga that Shit,
get some ice cream,

777
00:36:55,360 --> 00:37:00,360
go outside.
Don't you have friends?

778
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,350
You don't have friends,
your friend.

779
00:37:05,351 --> 00:37:10,351
Fuck your wife.
Your friend was also your boss

780
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:13,570
and you know,
got a wife.

781
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:15,940
Okay.
And your dog's gone.

782
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,590
Whereas your dark.
Oh,

783
00:37:17,591 --> 00:37:20,410
your friend took your dog.
Be My favorite episode of Frasier.

784
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,513
Yeah.

785
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:27,070
Some people have a rough man.
Some people's,

786
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:27,963
you know,
some.

787
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,810
Some people have leukemia,
some people have genetic disorders,

788
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,840
some people's brains don't work right.
For whatever reason,

789
00:37:34,841 --> 00:37:38,320
whether it's nature or nurture,
there's something going on that's real

790
00:37:38,321 --> 00:37:40,780
bad and they're just.
They're in a whole.

791
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,640
Red.
Described it really well.

792
00:37:42,641 --> 00:37:45,850
He did a podcast recently with me and he
talked about.

793
00:37:45,851 --> 00:37:50,320
He went through a serious depression
episode where he was suicidal and he.

794
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:53,800
His brain was just the way he described
it as like it was broken and I had to

795
00:37:53,801 --> 00:37:57,830
get it fixed and he started off on
medication than weaned himself off a

796
00:37:57,831 --> 00:37:59,990
medication,
but when he was on the medication,

797
00:37:59,991 --> 00:38:03,400
that's also when his career took off and
when his career took off.

798
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:08,670
I mean it alleviated a lot of the.
The what a lot of his issues were was

799
00:38:09,851 --> 00:38:12,910
also just like an unfulfilled life
frustration,

800
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,210
expectation,
unrealized and then on top of that

801
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:20,730
compounded there was like legit mental
issues that were bothering them.

802
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:23,170
I,
I guess I was just unclear on like what

803
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:25,180
depression actually is like.
I'm like,

804
00:38:25,181 --> 00:38:26,320
because as you're saying that stuff,
I'm like,

805
00:38:26,321 --> 00:38:27,760
hmm,
maybe I have felt that

806
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:33,720
everybody feels highs and the lows.
You're right about that for sure.

807
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:36,760
Right about that.
But you exercise a lot and I think that

808
00:38:36,761 --> 00:38:38,720
probably helps.
Yeah.

809
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:41,710
I'm just super myself up in my head and
shit.

810
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:46,240
But no exercising just releases releases
a lot of the bullshit that people carry

811
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:49,240
around.
A lot of the what makes people feel

812
00:38:49,241 --> 00:38:52,960
terrible is that their body is fighting
against their brain.

813
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:56,920
Their body holds in so much tension and
there,

814
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:02,040
there are so fucked up and they never
get an endorphin release and their

815
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:05,290
bodies like an overflowing battery like
oozing out of the signs

816
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:07,980
know.
And I always like,

817
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:10,830
people don't meditate like that.
Don't work for people.

818
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:13,800
Like this shit works.
That shit killed it for me.

819
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,970
How often you meditate?
Shit.

820
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:18,210
Like every day,
like how much time?

821
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:19,330
Twenty minutes.

822
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:20,260
Oh,
that's good man.

823
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,610
Look,
that is a beautiful thing.

824
00:39:21,611 --> 00:39:24,550
If you could force that into your
schedule and make sure that that's a

825
00:39:24,551 --> 00:39:25,384
part of your life.

826
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:28,710
I got it from Seinfeld and Oprah now.
Like 10,

827
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,610
maybe 10.
Yeah.

828
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,620
Like,
no,

829
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:32,310
no,
it's.

830
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:35,720
I mean it doesn't activate something
that have,

831
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:39,060
which is like we're supposed to kind of
do that though.

832
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:42,070
The reflection and also what I think it
does,

833
00:39:42,071 --> 00:39:44,860
one of the real good things that
meditation does is it stops momentum

834
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:48,730
because there's like a momentum of
shitty thoughts and bad ideas and bad

835
00:39:48,731 --> 00:39:53,020
decisions and just anxiety and all these
issues that could fucking just

836
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:57,610
accumulate inside your consciousness and
they never went unaddressed.

837
00:39:57,670 --> 00:40:01,030
They continue to like push it.
You from the back and it's like you're

838
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:04,270
just constantly in a state of momentum
of all the bullshit that's going on.

839
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,780
But if you have a time for real
reflection and just pause,

840
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:10,450
even if you're just concentrating only
on your breath,

841
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:13,150
one,
it seems to stop that momentum and give

842
00:40:13,151 --> 00:40:15,340
you a chance at like a renewed
perspective.

843
00:40:15,341 --> 00:40:15,990
Active.

844
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:17,220
Yeah,
that,

845
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:19,700
that's correct.
Remember at the time I had a spiritual

846
00:40:19,701 --> 00:40:24,701
awakening in your house.
What happened?

847
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:28,490
What was it about?
It just hit them.

848
00:40:28,491 --> 00:40:32,540
One day I was watching,
I was watching like a seinfeld interview

849
00:40:32,541 --> 00:40:33,321
or something.
He was like,

850
00:40:33,321 --> 00:40:34,640
yeah,
I do it twice a day.

851
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:35,770
And I was like,
man,

852
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:37,550
let me see.
This all went down.

853
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:40,700
I used to live with them so I use.
I went downstairs with my room and I

854
00:40:40,701 --> 00:40:43,120
meditated and I came back upstairs and I
was like,

855
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:44,570
he was sitting on the couch and I was
like,

856
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:49,270
I was like,
Nigga,

857
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,200
I just had an awakening.
It was like,

858
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:56,550
what happened?
I was like,

859
00:40:57,170 --> 00:40:58,310
oh no man,
but the first,

860
00:40:58,311 --> 00:41:01,280
the first message I got was a,
you can't save the world,

861
00:41:01,281 --> 00:41:04,140
but you could help.
He was like,

862
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:08,350
okay,
I'm going to back down in my room.

863
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:11,470
So when you do it,
what's your process like?

864
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:14,420
What is what it,
how exactly you practice tm?

865
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,730
A sit there,
cross my legs,

866
00:41:16,731 --> 00:41:19,550
uh,
in through the nose,

867
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:22,050
out the mouth and through the nose,
out the mouth.

868
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:25,540
You get into the state.
Also though,

869
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:31,480
has the ability to completely clear his
mind like he's one of those people that

870
00:41:31,741 --> 00:41:34,040
uh,
it takes me anywhere from

871
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,230
20 minutes,
so like an hour to fall asleep.

872
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,530
Even if tired,
it's still like,

873
00:41:39,531 --> 00:41:41,190
all right,
there's a Gemara.

874
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:44,480
Could immediately,
immediately just like,

875
00:41:44,481 --> 00:41:46,280
all right,
I'll being awake is over.

876
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:47,810
All right.
And then just fall asleep.

877
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:52,250
Like instantaneously.
He can clear his head really quickly.

878
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,590
Like focus on one thing.

879
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:57,290
You've got a high level of.
I don't give a very high level.

880
00:41:58,270 --> 00:41:59,520
Yeah,
no you are,

881
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:01,870
you are.
So congrats for us.

882
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,070
So you go in through the nose,
out through the mouth.

883
00:42:04,071 --> 00:42:05,420
And what are you thinking when you're
doing that?

884
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:07,700
Uh,
nothing,

885
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,800
nothing.
Just are you thinking about the

886
00:42:09,801 --> 00:42:10,820
breathing?
Um,

887
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:16,060
well I think about nothing.
And then if I have a task or something,

888
00:42:17,061 --> 00:42:20,270
like if I'd be like,
you could do affirmations,

889
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:21,523
you know,
like,

890
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:22,960
hey man,
I want it.

891
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:26,630
I want to be great on stage tonight or I
want to,

892
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:29,490
or I wanna I want to get this writing
done or I want to,

893
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:33,050
you know what I'm saying?
Or eat you can hype yourself up and shit

894
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:35,840
like that.
Like a big it,

895
00:42:35,841 --> 00:42:37,720
um,
your intention.

896
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:40,760
It's just sad.
Whatever intention that you want to do,

897
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:42,470
you know what I'm saying?
You set that hey,

898
00:42:42,471 --> 00:42:44,030
I want to,
you know,

899
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,710
whatever the fuck.

900
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,320
And then it'll be easier to complete
that task.

901
00:42:48,321 --> 00:42:49,550
For me,
I have add,

902
00:42:49,551 --> 00:42:53,740
I'm bad at focusing on things but that
really helps me.

903
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,940
You have add but you don't have a
problem meditating.

904
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:57,260
Yeah.
Because,

905
00:42:57,350 --> 00:43:00,790
because it's the lazy,
it's really good at being lazy and it's

906
00:43:00,791 --> 00:43:05,100
kind of lazy to like meditate them.
It's Kinda like I was like,

907
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:08,910
you guys are like to move in.
Yeah.

908
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:11,060
Yeah.
It just sit there and fucking zone out

909
00:43:11,061 --> 00:43:13,460
and shit.
Like if you like mushrooms and all that

910
00:43:13,461 --> 00:43:14,390
shit.
You know what I'm saying?

911
00:43:14,391 --> 00:43:18,830
This shit is perfect for you.
It's getting high off your own dmt.

912
00:43:18,831 --> 00:43:20,630
That's what it is.
It's just you on Dmt,

913
00:43:20,631 --> 00:43:22,010
the spirit molecule,
all that shit.

914
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:24,530
I don't know if it's that because you
don't,

915
00:43:24,531 --> 00:43:25,780
you're not tripping,
right?

916
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:27,150
It is,
it's an essay.

917
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,330
It's,
it's Kinda.

918
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:29,203
You ever do it right?

919
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:30,560
Uh,
no.

920
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,110
I,
I've gone through phases where I tried

921
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:35,260
meditation,
I shower for an hour,

922
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:36,980
15 minutes.
So that's kind of

923
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:40,730
already though.
Just kind of walk around and think,

924
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:42,380
yeah,
yeah,

925
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:43,370
I,
I kinda,

926
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:45,471
you know,
I don't know.

927
00:43:45,471 --> 00:43:46,400
I,
I've tried it,

928
00:43:46,401 --> 00:43:47,030
but it's,

929
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:49,210
oh,
they eat work out though and it's,

930
00:43:49,211 --> 00:43:50,800
you know,
those endorphins that you read,

931
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:54,430
you can just do that.
You could also do that by just sitting

932
00:43:54,431 --> 00:43:58,360
there and just breathe in and you know,
focusing on the breath and then all of a

933
00:43:58,361 --> 00:44:02,350
sudden your mind starts going into an
altered state and then you'll start.

934
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:03,881
Yeah,
I meditate.

935
00:44:03,881 --> 00:44:05,650
I just don't meditate every day.
But uh,

936
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:08,560
I definitely feel it.
I think exercise does that,

937
00:44:08,590 --> 00:44:13,060
especially cardio and especially yoga,
something about yoga classes that just

938
00:44:13,061 --> 00:44:16,450
forces you into this state of mind where
you just are,

939
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,090
you're only concentrating on the
movements that you're supposed to do.

940
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:24,300
So if you could clear your head and stay
focused on the movements and not delve

941
00:44:24,401 --> 00:44:28,360
into your bank account or your fucking
credit card debt or what's wrong with

942
00:44:28,361 --> 00:44:31,150
your car,
what are the bullshit you have bounced

943
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:32,070
around in your head?
If you could just

944
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:35,100
take the time to concentrate only on the
yoga.

945
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:38,050
It has this like a cleansing effect.
It,

946
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:39,450
it really made you be like,
man,

947
00:44:39,451 --> 00:44:41,130
fuck that shit.
Fuck that shit.

948
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:44,490
Most things,
most things are not worth freaking out

949
00:44:44,491 --> 00:44:45,241
about.
Most.

950
00:44:45,241 --> 00:44:47,190
The vast majority.
A good question.

951
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:47,640
I don't remember

952
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:52,300
reading is a,
just ask yourself what problems do I

953
00:44:52,301 --> 00:44:57,301
have right now but genuinely like
problems and the answer may not always

954
00:44:57,551 --> 00:45:01,780
be zero,
but it's usually surprisingly small.

955
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:04,180
When you think about the immediate,
you know,

956
00:45:05,290 --> 00:45:09,100
not just the base level of maslow's
hierarchy,

957
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:12,430
you know,
like if that's taken care of usually

958
00:45:12,431 --> 00:45:14,010
it's like Oh I don't re,
you know,

959
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:16,240
there are things that are ongoing things
to figure out,

960
00:45:16,241 --> 00:45:20,440
but like things that you could define as
like a problem and then just kind of

961
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,690
staying in that space you have like,
you know,

962
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:27,970
like a control issue.
Like what's a real issue where there's

963
00:45:27,971 --> 00:45:29,890
like immediacy,
like you know,

964
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:31,210
and,
and when,

965
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:34,630
when there are real problems,
you know,

966
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:37,540
a lot of times you,
you handled it well,

967
00:45:37,541 --> 00:45:42,541
like instinctually the things like a lot
of times people get caught in those

968
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:48,190
intense situations,
like they can handle like real problems.

969
00:45:48,191 --> 00:45:52,970
It's the anticipation of problems and
the anticipation of solutions that bass.

970
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:55,060
It's a very good point.
Yeah,

971
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:56,450
that's a very good point.
Yeah.

972
00:45:56,451 --> 00:46:00,170
A lot of times real problems.
They also sort of enlightened you to the

973
00:46:00,171 --> 00:46:02,990
fact that most of the time you,
your problems are bullshit.

974
00:46:03,390 --> 00:46:04,460
You know,
you break your leg,

975
00:46:04,510 --> 00:46:05,343
you're,
oh,

976
00:46:05,350 --> 00:46:05,950
this is.
Yeah.

977
00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:07,500
That's an immediate.
Yeah,

978
00:46:07,510 --> 00:46:08,790
yeah,
yeah,

979
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:10,200
yeah,
yeah.

980
00:46:10,201 --> 00:46:12,180
And so just staying in the space of
like,

981
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:14,360
you know,
alright I can,

982
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,240
you're in a control center.
You Go,

983
00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:21,470
you know what helps me is a bit like.
Because Yoga is hard to do,

984
00:46:22,770 --> 00:46:25,920
doing things that are difficult to do.
Make things easier,

985
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:29,510
make other things easier,
working out hard workouts,

986
00:46:29,570 --> 00:46:31,110
make other things easier.
Yeah.

987
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:33,710
Running hills,
kickboxing,

988
00:46:33,770 --> 00:46:38,020
anything give us context.
It gives context to everything drawn up

989
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:43,030
and makes Hollywood interactions easy.
There you go.

990
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:44,420
You know what I mean?
Like it,

991
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:47,350
it gives context.
Yeah.

992
00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:50,050
What is the struggle was like,
well,

993
00:46:50,051 --> 00:46:51,010
it's like,
you know,

994
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:54,190
someone by the time you get on stage
you're like,

995
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:57,400
well,
my body thought it was going to die this

996
00:46:57,401 --> 00:46:57,910
morning.

997
00:46:57,910 --> 00:47:00,250
Yeah.
And it didn't.

998
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:01,920
So this is fine.
Yeah.

999
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:06,220
Now this tag doesn't work.
Do you guys know very many people that

1000
00:47:06,270 --> 00:47:07,880
do Jitsu?
No.

1001
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,020
Uh,
and by very many,

1002
00:47:09,021 --> 00:47:09,854
I mean,
uh,

1003
00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:10,903
you,

1004
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:15,100
yeah,
that's the most chill people ever

1005
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:16,900
because they getting choked all the
time.

1006
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:20,020
They're fighting for their life every
day.

1007
00:47:20,021 --> 00:47:22,870
So there's,
so there's so many events to train the

1008
00:47:22,871 --> 00:47:26,920
killers trying to break their arms.
If the experience is not that cool,

1009
00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:28,480
then it's like whatever,
man,

1010
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:31,510
I'm not worried about it that much.

1011
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,091
Yeah.
We,

1012
00:47:35,091 --> 00:47:37,190
you know,
the world is pretty soft right now.

1013
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:41,630
It's easy to get upset about nonsense.
Nonsense is the only thing that you have

1014
00:47:41,631 --> 00:47:43,370
that's a difficulty in your life.
Well,

1015
00:47:43,371 --> 00:47:45,520
it's,
and it's perspective.

1016
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:49,980
The reward for complaints.
Hm.

1017
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:52,130
Uh,
it's like a culture.

1018
00:47:52,131 --> 00:47:56,570
That's where we are rewarded for
publicly,

1019
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:59,740
you know,
for having a public completion.

1020
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,720
Me,
I'm well rewarded in the sense of like,

1021
00:48:02,721 --> 00:48:03,830
you know,
you get a,

1022
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:06,910
you can get attention for,
you can get attention for light,

1023
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:10,040
but I'm just saying by publicly airing
a,

1024
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:12,800
you know,
a grievance about a project and I'm

1025
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:17,490
speaking especially specifically about
how we respond to content is just like,

1026
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:22,520
like a by publicly saying this,
you can speak to your respective group

1027
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:28,400
and you have an immediate reward for it.
So it's like,

1028
00:48:28,401 --> 00:48:29,490
you know,
it's like,

1029
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:30,860
I don't even know if we're more
sensitive.

1030
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:34,140
We're just more outspoken about,
you know,

1031
00:48:34,550 --> 00:48:37,850
things well because we have a definitely
more outraged.

1032
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:39,860
They're looking to get outraged.
That's,

1033
00:48:39,870 --> 00:48:42,340
that's a really common thing now that
just didn't exist a few days.

1034
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:44,930
I don't even think it's,
I don't even think it's outrageous.

1035
00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:45,741
You know what I mean?
Like I,

1036
00:48:45,741 --> 00:48:48,710
I really don't think it's outrageous as
much as it cause outrage.

1037
00:48:48,711 --> 00:48:53,060
We've seen what outrage looks like at
the,

1038
00:48:53,710 --> 00:48:58,710
when at the peak of like the black lives
matter movement where people at a core

1039
00:49:00,811 --> 00:49:02,630
is by people outraged.
Yeah.

1040
00:49:02,631 --> 00:49:04,670
But that's the streets,
but that's what I'm saying,

1041
00:49:04,671 --> 00:49:08,090
but that's what,
that's what outrage is and I don't want

1042
00:49:08,091 --> 00:49:10,820
to confuse that with like,
you know,

1043
00:49:10,850 --> 00:49:13,130
ational outreach,
restoration or outrage.

1044
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:15,530
Right.
And it's really important to draw that

1045
00:49:15,531 --> 00:49:16,281
distinction.
Right.

1046
00:49:16,281 --> 00:49:18,260
And so it's like,
it's,

1047
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:20,390
again,
people are vocal about things.

1048
00:49:20,391 --> 00:49:24,440
Some issues real,
a lot of things we started getting upset

1049
00:49:24,441 --> 00:49:27,830
about there.
Like certain we get upset about certain

1050
00:49:28,010 --> 00:49:32,390
cultural appropriation things of the
week because it's a Sushi restaurant on

1051
00:49:32,391 --> 00:49:35,020
a college campus.
Like we,

1052
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:39,200
we get caught up in those things but in
and not focus on,

1053
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:40,890
you know,
like I dunno,

1054
00:49:40,910 --> 00:49:45,290
it's like real outrageous.
The thing that corporations or afraid of

1055
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:48,110
is an outrage.
It's trending.

1056
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:53,260
You don't want to trend negatively for
like whatever period of time when,

1057
00:49:53,470 --> 00:49:57,830
when people are upset with you and that
you've done something genuinely wrong,

1058
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:02,510
they'll show it beyond.
It will extend that if it makes sense.

1059
00:50:02,511 --> 00:50:03,050
Yeah.

1060
00:50:03,050 --> 00:50:05,120
Yeah.
I think that a lot of what outrages is

1061
00:50:05,121 --> 00:50:07,520
like comedian trying out jokes,
you know,

1062
00:50:07,521 --> 00:50:10,820
you try out jokes and 30 percent of them
are just straight bullshit

1063
00:50:12,870 --> 00:50:13,910
fucking work,
man.

1064
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:16,400
He'd try him.
They they stumble out,

1065
00:50:16,401 --> 00:50:20,390
you gave it a shot or you'll ad Lib
something in the moment on stage and

1066
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:23,060
even after you say like,
what the fuck did I just say?

1067
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:26,840
I think there's some of that that people
are trying to.

1068
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:27,980
Like I was reading this article the

1069
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:31,940
other day about some woman who's saying
that yoga is supporting white supremacy

1070
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:35,240
because it's,
it was the dumbest shit ever.

1071
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:37,760
Some Indian lady,
she was seeing the cultural

1072
00:50:37,761 --> 00:50:42,761
appropriation of yoga by white people is
supporting white supremacy and it was,

1073
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,720
you know,
it's really fun.

1074
00:50:44,721 --> 00:50:47,510
What are we doing exactly?
What the fuck are we doing?

1075
00:50:47,511 --> 00:50:49,760
But that's what she did is she tried a
bad joke,

1076
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:51,740
you know,
she's a,

1077
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:56,210
she works on,
she's a professor at some bullshit

1078
00:50:56,211 --> 00:51:01,211
college where they're just drowning in
liberal arts and she just figured out a

1079
00:51:01,371 --> 00:51:06,110
way to say something outrageous that she
thought made sense in her own weird

1080
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:08,720
bubble.
But this got published in a newspaper

1081
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:11,000
and then the whole world went just
collectively.

1082
00:51:11,001 --> 00:51:13,900
What the fuck are you talking about?
Yeah,

1083
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,400
but that's what it's like.
It's like you are.

1084
00:51:16,401 --> 00:51:20,810
I try and a bit late night at the store.

1085
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:24,110
You Do,
you just just riff something and it just

1086
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:29,500
goes into a corner and just get stuck.
Roomba vacuum cleaner things is bouncing

1087
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:32,660
off the wire.
Like this is not working.

1088
00:51:33,030 --> 00:51:35,330
I've got to bail out of this.
Yeah,

1089
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37,700
know.
It's funny because it is people's

1090
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:40,790
favorite rage.
It's a creative force.

1091
00:51:40,791 --> 00:51:43,370
She's like,
she tried to make outrage where it

1092
00:51:43,371 --> 00:51:47,660
didn't exist
and sometimes he catches right?

1093
00:51:47,661 --> 00:51:50,450
Like hoop earrings.
White girls can't wear hoop earrings

1094
00:51:50,451 --> 00:51:52,150
anymore.
Was scared.

1095
00:51:52,151 --> 00:51:56,060
Were hooping hearings because they're
getting called out for cultural

1096
00:51:56,061 --> 00:51:59,350
appropriation by which is hilarious by
Latina chicks.

1097
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:03,080
This particularly Latino chicks are
saying and it's just all social justice

1098
00:52:03,081 --> 00:52:05,330
warrior bullshit.
But what's really funny is.

1099
00:52:05,410 --> 00:52:07,190
So I had.
Because I'm an asshole,

1100
00:52:07,191 --> 00:52:09,500
I had to google it.
Well who the fuck invented hearings?

1101
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:12,030
The Sumerians,
the,

1102
00:52:12,031 --> 00:52:17,031
the oldest version of hoop earrings is
for 2,500 BC from Iraq.

1103
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:22,160
So Iraqis are the only ones who really
can claim cultural appropriation.

1104
00:52:22,490 --> 00:52:24,650
People wearing hoop earrings,
not Mexicans.

1105
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:29,240
So Mexicans settled down those white
girls alone because you stole it.

1106
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:32,120
It was black girl.
Shit.

1107
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:36,230
Shit,
it's like who invented pants?

1108
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,390
Your culture appropriating.
You're wearing pants.

1109
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:41,330
Who invented paper?
You're on a Korean phone,

1110
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:46,180
bitching about people
talking about man,

1111
00:52:46,290 --> 00:52:48,140
it goes deep.
It's crazy.

1112
00:52:48,170 --> 00:52:50,510
People losing their mind,
they're looking for things get outraged

1113
00:52:50,511 --> 00:52:53,600
at and so that they're trying jokes,
they're taking swings,

1114
00:52:53,830 --> 00:52:56,390
you know,
the trying to pitches out there,

1115
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:57,980
you know,
just spit balling.

1116
00:52:58,110 --> 00:53:00,560
Well,
I mean eventually if it's like,

1117
00:53:00,561 --> 00:53:05,561
if you,
you're gonna run out of ways to approach

1118
00:53:05,871 --> 00:53:06,651
it,
you know what I mean?

1119
00:53:06,651 --> 00:53:10,310
Like you run out of.
We're run out of places to stab the

1120
00:53:10,311 --> 00:53:12,680
thing.
Will they try some that don't stick or

1121
00:53:12,681 --> 00:53:15,410
some stick for like a couple of days,
like you remember Bossy,

1122
00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:17,330
they're trying to say you can't say
bossy.

1123
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:19,340
No.
Why can't call girls bossy?

1124
00:53:19,341 --> 00:53:21,710
It's sexist crows.
Girls Bossy.

1125
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:24,440
Don't call them bossy sex.
He was a thing where they were trying to

1126
00:53:24,441 --> 00:53:26,220
stop the use of the word

1127
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:28,870
or the phrase bossy.
Bossy.

1128
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:30,610
Sexist.
Yeah.

1129
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:31,533
See?
But like,

1130
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:34,080
like can I ask a question?
Where did,

1131
00:53:34,081 --> 00:53:35,010
uh,
when,

1132
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:35,970
when did,
uh,

1133
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:41,000
when did cunt become a bad word?
It depends on who's here in England,

1134
00:53:42,421 --> 00:53:43,410
man.
They don't give a fuck.

1135
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:48,500
Is that lumping a herd the herd used
until,

1136
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:50,040
I mean,
nobody.

1137
00:53:50,041 --> 00:53:52,370
I didn't grow up around it.
I didn't hear people saying this.

1138
00:53:52,390 --> 00:53:54,000
I don't even think I heard it used until
late.

1139
00:53:54,990 --> 00:53:56,440
I mean,
I was probably

1140
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,390
like a Hollywood where it.
Yeah.

1141
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:01,470
Yeah.
No,

1142
00:54:01,490 --> 00:54:03,870
it's a word that you used when you used
it.

1143
00:54:03,871 --> 00:54:06,000
You fucking really were angry.
Yeah.

1144
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:07,320
Yeah.
It just,

1145
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:09,990
I don't know where it came from.
It's like the new bitch.

1146
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,180
It's not new.
I mean it was around a long.

1147
00:54:12,210 --> 00:54:13,910
It's been around.
So I was in high school,

1148
00:54:14,130 --> 00:54:15,810
but you called someone a continent high
school.

1149
00:54:15,811 --> 00:54:19,050
Mind you were ready to fight or brother
Shit would get deep.

1150
00:54:19,110 --> 00:54:20,610
You couldn't say con.
You could say,

1151
00:54:20,611 --> 00:54:21,990
bitch,
you're a fucking bitch.

1152
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:23,850
You know,
like,

1153
00:54:23,870 --> 00:54:24,740
yeah,
you're up con.

1154
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:28,500
Oh,
like would they be like,

1155
00:54:28,501 --> 00:54:30,630
what the fuck did you just say?
Ask?

1156
00:54:31,110 --> 00:54:32,010
Yeah,
I,

1157
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:32,620
uh,
yeah,

1158
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:34,030
I,
I didn't hear it a lot

1159
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:41,070
and I could never imagine myself
casually called and some money can't.

1160
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:43,000
But if you lived in England,
you could.

1161
00:54:44,610 --> 00:54:47,510
Especially if I lived in Australia,
they call someone a good con.

1162
00:54:48,330 --> 00:54:50,040
He's a good con.
Oh,

1163
00:54:50,070 --> 00:54:51,450
so it's a nice word.
Yeah.

1164
00:54:51,451 --> 00:54:52,170
He's,
he's a,

1165
00:54:52,170 --> 00:54:53,340
he's a,
he's a good dude.

1166
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:56,220
He's a good con.
Like people have,

1167
00:54:56,221 --> 00:54:57,210
uh,
my friend,

1168
00:54:57,211 --> 00:55:00,000
uh,
Israel at a Sandhya style bender,

1169
00:55:00,001 --> 00:55:03,540
he wears a shirt that says good con and
he just wanders around.

1170
00:55:03,541 --> 00:55:07,110
It's from New Zealand because they don't
want people.

1171
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:09,320
They think it's gonna upset.
People get upset about.

1172
00:55:10,410 --> 00:55:12,240
He's a savage.
You'd better be careful.

1173
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:18,200
Get upset with him
because he's a UFC fighter.

1174
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:19,230
Oh,
okay.

1175
00:55:19,230 --> 00:55:19,980
All right.
Yeah,

1176
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:21,420
he's a,
I mean,

1177
00:55:21,450 --> 00:55:22,890
he's,
he's from another country.

1178
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,960
It means a different thing in New
Zealand.

1179
00:55:24,990 --> 00:55:27,280
If you say con in New Zealand,
it's a,

1180
00:55:28,230 --> 00:55:29,550
it's like,
I mean,

1181
00:55:29,551 --> 00:55:32,060
what's the equivalent will be equivalent
of con,

1182
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:34,260
the way they said.
Good Dude.

1183
00:55:34,261 --> 00:55:36,360
He's a good fucker.
He's a,

1184
00:55:37,290 --> 00:55:39,150
he's a cool motherfucker.
He's a good client.

1185
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:44,720
Were you asking because
their wears that everywhere.

1186
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:47,150
No one says shit.
Yeah.

1187
00:55:47,330 --> 00:55:48,163
Well,
yeah,

1188
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:51,070
but they sell those shirts.
Look good con.

1189
00:55:51,810 --> 00:55:56,810
I don't know
why censorship Hashtag fuck censorship.

1190
00:55:57,780 --> 00:56:02,700
Hashtag make gray together.
Well,

1191
00:56:02,701 --> 00:56:03,700
I was gonna say,
is it,

1192
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:04,980
is it that,
uh,

1193
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:07,590
we're just like,
people's reaction to it just kind of

1194
00:56:07,591 --> 00:56:09,030
bothered it.
Yeah.

1195
00:56:09,110 --> 00:56:10,650
I'm like,
that's it.

1196
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:12,540
It's a terrible,
terrible,

1197
00:56:12,541 --> 00:56:15,420
bad word like that where it sucks.
Like,

1198
00:56:16,650 --> 00:56:18,130
motherfucker,
you don't like it,

1199
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:19,980
but don't think it's fun to say,
you know,

1200
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:23,840
rhythmically it's just trash.
It's like I,

1201
00:56:23,990 --> 00:56:24,950
I was going off it.
What?

1202
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:27,180
Interesting.
Shit,

1203
00:56:27,790 --> 00:56:29,830
I don't know if you went to Australia
though,

1204
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:31,420
they,
they would say it so many times.

1205
00:56:31,421 --> 00:56:33,940
It would just slip in.
Just gets normal.

1206
00:56:34,450 --> 00:56:35,350
Yeah,
I guess,

1207
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:36,160
yeah,
it is just,

1208
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:39,120
it's this one syllable like con.

1209
00:56:39,350 --> 00:56:42,560
It means dude over there sometimes.
And this fucking cat,

1210
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:45,320
he goes over there and they'll start
talking about it.

1211
00:56:45,321 --> 00:56:48,140
Like this fucking dude.
They'll still literally say it in the

1212
00:56:48,141 --> 00:56:53,141
same way you would say this fucking guy.
It's just a different thing.

1213
00:56:57,411 --> 00:56:57,951
I mean,
look,

1214
00:56:57,951 --> 00:57:01,090
they're all just sounds to convey
expression in the world problems.

1215
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:03,860
When you demonize one,
you say you can't say the c word

1216
00:57:03,861 --> 00:57:05,750
anymore.
Don't say the c word.

1217
00:57:05,970 --> 00:57:06,661
Well,
yeah,

1218
00:57:06,661 --> 00:57:09,280
I mean again,
it's just like,

1219
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:12,090
I just want us to have like adult
arguments.

1220
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:13,680
Yeah,
right.

1221
00:57:13,770 --> 00:57:16,590
Well it's hard to have adult arguments,
even forbidden words.

1222
00:57:17,190 --> 00:57:18,023
Well,
yeah.

1223
00:57:18,110 --> 00:57:21,810
Well because that's like the,
the shit that your sister got mad at you

1224
00:57:21,811 --> 00:57:23,320
about growing up.
Right.

1225
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:25,280
You caught me.
You know what I mean?

1226
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:27,960
It is kind of like,
that's the thing.

1227
00:57:27,961 --> 00:57:29,910
It's,
I mean you were saying intention

1228
00:57:29,911 --> 00:57:31,350
earlier,
but I mean there's always like

1229
00:57:31,351 --> 00:57:33,690
intention.
Like what do you mean by I get it,

1230
00:57:33,691 --> 00:57:38,691
I get in these types of my mom,
southern Christian woman in any curse

1231
00:57:40,291 --> 00:57:43,430
word that I say any curse words is very.
She,

1232
00:57:43,450 --> 00:57:45,240
she doesn't,
she doesn't like it and I,

1233
00:57:45,550 --> 00:57:50,550
I curse around all the time.
I'll always do just because we get into

1234
00:57:50,551 --> 00:57:55,551
the argument while simultaneously
respecting her views and beliefs.

1235
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:57,150
It's also like,
you know,

1236
00:57:57,990 --> 00:58:00,810
these cuss words read.
Did you fucking kitchen lady

1237
00:58:04,310 --> 00:58:09,310
know I love her.
I love watching her,

1238
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:12,000
like react to it.
Like it's like fun.

1239
00:58:12,230 --> 00:58:13,340
Yeah.
Yeah.

1240
00:58:13,710 --> 00:58:14,850
Because just like,
oh,

1241
00:58:14,851 --> 00:58:17,910
this through the filter of you,
like really,

1242
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:18,960
you know?
See,

1243
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:22,250
I grew up non suppressed.
My parents were hippies and they didn't

1244
00:58:22,251 --> 00:58:25,940
give a shit where we said we just
couldn't really say it at school,

1245
00:58:26,330 --> 00:58:29,150
but you know,
there was no like language restrictions

1246
00:58:29,151 --> 00:58:31,190
in my house and be allowed to say
anything.

1247
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:32,690
That's great.
It was weird.

1248
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:34,460
That was great.
And my friends would come over the

1249
00:58:34,461 --> 00:58:35,630
house.
Did you just say fuck in front of your

1250
00:58:35,631 --> 00:58:36,750
mom?
Like yeah,

1251
00:58:36,790 --> 00:58:37,623
fuck it.

1252
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,430
I used to.
I,

1253
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:42,900
I did.
You grow up around people that like used

1254
00:58:42,901 --> 00:58:46,270
to just talk shit back to the mall is
like,

1255
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:49,010
it would never did that.
It was fun too.

1256
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:53,150
I had a friend,
right?

1257
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:56,310
Alex is still one of my favorite moments
of life.

1258
00:58:56,670 --> 00:58:59,770
It was just like we came,
I came to this house after school and

1259
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:02,800
his mom's name is Patricia and she was
just like,

1260
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:04,960
I'll take out the garbage.
He was like,

1261
00:59:04,961 --> 00:59:07,230
go to hell.
Pat says,

1262
00:59:07,231 --> 00:59:08,240
respond to calls,
mom.

1263
00:59:08,241 --> 00:59:09,490
Passion.
I caught it on fire.

1264
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:15,920
Like my mind was blown,
told his mom to go to hell.

1265
00:59:16,990 --> 00:59:20,050
It was like amazing.
And she just argued back like it was.

1266
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:23,810
Yeah,
single mama was a data around,

1267
00:59:23,870 --> 00:59:25,250
uh,
he knows that,

1268
00:59:25,251 --> 00:59:30,251
but he wasn't around,
but it was amazing.

1269
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:32,690
It was amazing.
That's a struggle that.

1270
00:59:32,691 --> 00:59:34,820
Who's the man?
When did you start cussing around your

1271
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:35,654
mom?

1272
00:59:37,570 --> 00:59:40,520
It's been a few hours.
No,

1273
00:59:40,540 --> 00:59:44,360
I probably started A.
I moved out when I was a teenager.

1274
00:59:44,610 --> 00:59:48,030
I probably,
I mean she's heard me say it kind of

1275
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:49,320
throughout,
but just in income,

1276
00:59:49,370 --> 00:59:52,280
like not stopping it in conversation.
It's been years.

1277
00:59:52,281 --> 00:59:54,500
I mean I just always just kind of flow.
I'm low key,

1278
00:59:54,501 --> 00:59:59,501
still afraid because a lot from my mom
cuffs in front of my niece and nephew.

1279
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:05,990
Just how old are they all have money.
I have an 11 year old niece,

1280
01:00:05,991 --> 01:00:09,920
a nine year old nephew,
a couple two year old twins,

1281
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:11,960
three year old niece,
like just,

1282
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:17,920
and I am myself and speak exactly how I
normally speak around it.

1283
01:00:18,650 --> 01:00:20,180
You're an adult longer than you're a
kid,

1284
01:00:21,290 --> 01:00:22,640
you know.
And so it was just like,

1285
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,550
why am I going to pretend the world
sounds different?

1286
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:26,741
Look,
I,

1287
01:00:26,741 --> 01:00:30,600
I'm with you.
But it felt like whose kids are there?

1288
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:32,090
Your brothers?
My brother,

1289
01:00:32,150 --> 01:00:34,880
your brother and sister in law,
everybody cool with that or they get

1290
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:36,690
upset.
A vague.

1291
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:41,030
I mean they go like sometimes,
but it's also they get it.

1292
01:00:41,031 --> 01:00:43,970
They mocked my brother that they're very
understanding why they.

1293
01:00:44,410 --> 01:00:45,950
They get it.
They get that.

1294
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:49,150
It's just like how people talk.
It's so.

1295
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:51,860
Yeah.
I mean I think that's important.

1296
01:00:51,890 --> 01:00:52,850
Again,
like you don't want to.

1297
01:00:52,910 --> 01:00:55,140
That's the thing man.
Just like this.

1298
01:00:55,670 --> 01:00:56,930
No,
you fucked up.

1299
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:00,200
If you're at a job where not on keen,
not swear,

1300
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:05,440
but you can't swear off job with the
people you work with or does that tell

1301
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:06,591
or they'll get.
Yeah,

1302
01:01:06,591 --> 01:01:07,610
you can get trouble.
Yeah.

1303
01:01:08,070 --> 01:01:10,220
He,
if there's certain jobs where people

1304
01:01:10,221 --> 01:01:12,470
have,
where they got off work and they went

1305
01:01:12,471 --> 01:01:16,790
out with some coworkers and they told a
dirty joke or started talking shit like

1306
01:01:17,030 --> 01:01:19,850
that will get back to human resources
and there'll be fired.

1307
01:01:19,910 --> 01:01:24,910
Bosses are now following their employees
online and shit like twitter.

1308
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:28,460
That girl that got fired from NASA.
Fucking hilarious.

1309
01:01:28,910 --> 01:01:31,610
She got fired from NASA yesterday.
She was like,

1310
01:01:31,611 --> 01:01:34,340
Holy Fuck.
I got a job at NASA and some guy tweeted

1311
01:01:34,341 --> 01:01:36,500
her.
He said language and she said,

1312
01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:39,800
suck my Dick and balls.
I work at NASA,

1313
01:01:40,550 --> 01:01:41,480
and he said,
yeah,

1314
01:01:41,481 --> 01:01:45,780
and I am one of the people that oversee
something at Nasa and then it was

1315
01:01:47,590 --> 01:01:50,090
not.
Well she was about to be an intern

1316
01:01:50,091 --> 01:01:52,340
working at NASA and she was like,
here it is.

1317
01:01:52,730 --> 01:01:56,180
Everyone shut the fuck up.
I got accepted for a NASA internship and

1318
01:01:56,181 --> 01:01:57,560
look,
he writes language.

1319
01:01:57,710 --> 01:01:59,420
She says,
suck my Dick and balls.

1320
01:01:59,421 --> 01:02:03,680
I'm working at NASA and he says,
I'm on the National Space Council that

1321
01:02:03,681 --> 01:02:04,760
oversees NASA.

1322
01:02:08,870 --> 01:02:12,520
Come on,
first of all,

1323
01:02:12,550 --> 01:02:16,660
that shit is funny.
Suck my dick and balls and it's a girl.

1324
01:02:16,870 --> 01:02:19,060
Second of all,
we didn't even go to the fucking

1325
01:02:21,010 --> 01:02:23,370
the moon.
I saw you talking about that.

1326
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:24,160
Yeah.
No,

1327
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:24,993
I,
I don't.

1328
01:02:25,010 --> 01:02:26,400
I,
I could.

1329
01:02:26,590 --> 01:02:30,060
I can be convinced.
I was convinced that we didn't for a

1330
01:02:30,061 --> 01:02:31,650
long time.
Now I'm convinced.

1331
01:02:31,651 --> 01:02:33,030
I have no fucking idea.
Yeah,

1332
01:02:33,031 --> 01:02:33,650
I don't really.
I,

1333
01:02:33,650 --> 01:02:34,390
it's,
I,

1334
01:02:34,390 --> 01:02:38,490
I don't think we went to the moon just
off of base.

1335
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:40,980
It's not rooted in science.
How much?

1336
01:02:41,010 --> 01:02:42,380
How much have you really paid attention
to it?

1337
01:02:42,390 --> 01:02:44,940
[inaudible].
I went down the rabbit hole for many,

1338
01:02:44,941 --> 01:02:46,710
many years.
I go off kind of like,

1339
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:50,490
it's always like the social kind of
where there's smoke,

1340
01:02:50,491 --> 01:02:53,790
there's fire type foods of just like,
you know,

1341
01:02:53,791 --> 01:02:56,010
us being in a race and no countries
coming second,

1342
01:02:56,610 --> 01:02:58,200
uh,
you know,

1343
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:02,220
other space programs not catching up to
1969,

1344
01:03:02,730 --> 01:03:03,780
1969,
19,

1345
01:03:03,870 --> 01:03:07,080
72 American technology,
you know what I mean?

1346
01:03:07,081 --> 01:03:07,914
Like,
uh,

1347
01:03:08,210 --> 01:03:10,110
uh,
every time we went was under the Nixon

1348
01:03:10,111 --> 01:03:10,944
administration.

1349
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:12,520
That's a good one.
A,

1350
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:14,820
these types of little things that just
make you go

1351
01:03:16,340 --> 01:03:21,340
like a flat earthers conference.
You've ever watched the press conference

1352
01:03:21,361 --> 01:03:23,460
when they returned from the moon?
Uh,

1353
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:24,390
no.
Wait,

1354
01:03:24,410 --> 01:03:25,220
what,
what's,

1355
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:28,230
what's the,
what's the clue in there or what's the

1356
01:03:28,231 --> 01:03:31,110
suspicious thing?
They look super depressed.

1357
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:35,700
They look a super deceptive.
They look fidgety and uh,

1358
01:03:35,701 --> 01:03:36,320
they're,
they're,

1359
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:38,280
they're talking weird and they're saying
shit.

1360
01:03:38,340 --> 01:03:40,140
They refute later.
One of the things they said,

1361
01:03:40,141 --> 01:03:41,730
Michael Collins,
who's actually never,

1362
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:45,270
he's supposed to be in.
He'd never landed on the surface of the

1363
01:03:45,271 --> 01:03:47,610
moon.
Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong did.

1364
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:50,670
He stayed up in the orbiter and uh,
they were,

1365
01:03:50,710 --> 01:03:53,040
they were asking about stars and he
said,

1366
01:03:53,041 --> 01:03:53,611
um,
uh,

1367
01:03:53,611 --> 01:03:56,820
I don't recall seeing any stars.
And then years later he wrote in his

1368
01:03:56,821 --> 01:04:00,930
book about how magnificent stars look.
There's a lot of that shit,

1369
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:04,110
but the press conference,
if you want,

1370
01:04:04,111 --> 01:04:06,270
and this doesn't mean anything,
I'm not a cop,

1371
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:09,150
but if I was a cop and I was
interviewing them,

1372
01:04:09,370 --> 01:04:11,280
I'd be like,
these motherfuckers are guilty.

1373
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:13,380
Something is wrong here.
Like they,

1374
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:16,610
they seem like guilty people and you
could look.

1375
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:18,600
You don't get to say,
hey man,

1376
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:20,670
they were probably psychologically
distressed.

1377
01:04:20,671 --> 01:04:24,600
They were probably dealing with the,
the pressure of having come back from

1378
01:04:24,601 --> 01:04:28,320
the moon and all this fame that they had
never experienced their whole life.

1379
01:04:28,350 --> 01:04:29,520
They're not there.
Their astronauts,

1380
01:04:29,521 --> 01:04:31,800
they're scientists.
And now all of a sudden they're standing

1381
01:04:31,801 --> 01:04:34,290
in front of all these people and
everyone's asking them questions and

1382
01:04:34,291 --> 01:04:35,800
they feel super nervous.
But like,

1383
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:37,200
Nah,
these niggas was lying.

1384
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:39,750
Let me tell you everybody.
My favorite thing is when you,

1385
01:04:39,790 --> 01:04:43,410
when a [inaudible],
I'll say it very casually,

1386
01:04:43,690 --> 01:04:45,890
if people become like,
you know,

1387
01:04:46,290 --> 01:04:49,710
patriots and rocket scientists to tell
you like how we went,

1388
01:04:49,711 --> 01:04:51,210
I'm like,
you don't know either.

1389
01:04:51,310 --> 01:04:53,040
Well,
all this shit is bullshit because it

1390
01:04:53,041 --> 01:04:55,590
wasn't unit wasn't me,
so let's stop with that.

1391
01:04:55,600 --> 01:05:00,600
So we probably lied about it and we live
better than any other country on earth

1392
01:05:01,830 --> 01:05:04,430
and I'm proud of that.
There's a lot of weird shit with the

1393
01:05:04,710 --> 01:05:06,900
video footage.
There's a lot of footage where it looks

1394
01:05:06,901 --> 01:05:11,160
like they're on wires dangling from
wires and they bounced back up from

1395
01:05:11,161 --> 01:05:14,100
their feet in this weird way.
It looks they're being yanked up from

1396
01:05:14,101 --> 01:05:16,770
the ground.
There's a video where it looks like

1397
01:05:16,771 --> 01:05:17,920
they're on trampolines

1398
01:05:17,990 --> 01:05:20,440
is if you google astronauts on
trampolines.

1399
01:05:21,020 --> 01:05:23,010
I'm not even kidding.
It just looks like that.

1400
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:26,350
I actually put it up.
It's a video that I found Google

1401
01:05:26,351 --> 01:05:30,790
astronauts on trampolines is a video on
youtube and you're watching them bounce

1402
01:05:30,791 --> 01:05:31,720
around and you're like,
wait a minute,

1403
01:05:31,721 --> 01:05:34,450
wait a minute.
You guys are on the fucking moon and

1404
01:05:34,451 --> 01:05:38,080
you're hiding behind the lunar module,
like you can't see their feet,

1405
01:05:38,290 --> 01:05:41,980
you can't see how they're doing this,
but it looks like either they're

1406
01:05:42,010 --> 01:05:46,480
bouncing on something or the being
yanked up in the air or it's one,

1407
01:05:46,510 --> 01:05:49,960
six gravity and it's just has a weird
effect on people will look at this,

1408
01:05:49,961 --> 01:05:51,310
watch this.
Oh,

1409
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:56,460
how strange is this?
See,

1410
01:05:56,540 --> 01:05:57,670
look,
you just lands.

1411
01:05:58,660 --> 01:06:00,910
But doesn't that.
I mean even the way he's,

1412
01:06:01,150 --> 01:06:03,820
he's moving,
it's like he's being dangled.

1413
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:06,820
It's very strange to see him bouncing
around,

1414
01:06:07,090 --> 01:06:07,923
but that also

1415
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:10,830
just all the stuff we did at,
but we like playing golf with belts

1416
01:06:10,890 --> 01:06:13,010
around,
like the moon landing set was built by

1417
01:06:13,011 --> 01:06:15,560
the people who made the discovery zone,
but it also

1418
01:06:15,590 --> 01:06:17,980
could be.
This slide

1419
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:22,330
just jumped up and fell.
That's so strange,

1420
01:06:22,510 --> 01:06:25,930
but it also could be.
This is just what your body does at one

1421
01:06:25,931 --> 01:06:27,070
six.
Earth's gravity.

1422
01:06:27,610 --> 01:06:28,710
You know,
there's a whole.

1423
01:06:28,770 --> 01:06:29,650
Yeah.
I don't know.

1424
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:32,310
I'm excited to see.
Uh,

1425
01:06:32,311 --> 01:06:34,470
this one's weird.
Someone else going back to the moon and

1426
01:06:34,471 --> 01:06:35,580
then if it matches.

1427
01:06:36,810 --> 01:06:40,830
This is from a movie.
I forget what was the name of the movie

1428
01:06:40,831 --> 01:06:43,520
was,
but you could watch some of the NGO,

1429
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:46,380
the show,
some special effects they use in movies,

1430
01:06:46,710 --> 01:06:50,340
but watch some of the weird shit go a
little bit further ahead of this.

1431
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:51,870
Yeah,
right there.

1432
01:06:52,380 --> 01:06:56,370
There's some of the weird stuff where
you see these guys like fall down and

1433
01:06:56,371 --> 01:07:01,350
then it looks like they just get yanked
back up by wires is very strange.

1434
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:03,133
Yeah.
I mean,

1435
01:07:03,150 --> 01:07:04,690
but the press conferences is trained.

1436
01:07:05,270 --> 01:07:07,940
It's the,
it's the social aspect of it cause it's

1437
01:07:07,941 --> 01:07:12,941
like I don't begin to know like how the
flag is supposed to look in the waving

1438
01:07:14,631 --> 01:07:17,900
and the shadows and the thing that a lot
of people argue about,

1439
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:18,993
I,
I,

1440
01:07:19,490 --> 01:07:21,890
it's just the political and so it's
like,

1441
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:24,710
I kinda think I know when the government
is lying about something.

1442
01:07:25,430 --> 01:07:27,380
You know what I mean?
Like the history is there.

1443
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:29,970
Watch this,
watch this,

1444
01:07:31,420 --> 01:07:34,000
watch this,
watch how he gets up like you'd gotten

1445
01:07:34,001 --> 01:07:34,834
yanked up.

1446
01:07:36,210 --> 01:07:37,090
There's a bunch of those.

1447
01:07:37,350 --> 01:07:39,320
There's a bunch of those.
It makes it look like there are wires

1448
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:41,610
pulled back up their feet.
Very strange.

1449
01:07:41,940 --> 01:07:45,570
But again,
have you ever been in one six earth

1450
01:07:45,571 --> 01:07:46,590
gravity?
I haven't.

1451
01:07:46,630 --> 01:07:48,060
No.
What that maybe.

1452
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:52,960
Maybe it just looks fake because when
you're in one six earth gravity,

1453
01:07:52,961 --> 01:07:57,961
it's just how movement do you think?
We never ever been like up until day my,

1454
01:07:58,870 --> 01:08:03,870
my,
my conspiracy belief is specific to

1455
01:08:04,540 --> 01:08:09,540
thinking that a man has walked around on
the surface of the specific to the

1456
01:08:10,660 --> 01:08:11,970
crashing,
you know,

1457
01:08:12,150 --> 01:08:12,960
lunar,
whatever.

1458
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:13,870
That's all.
One hundred percent.

1459
01:08:14,170 --> 01:08:15,003
Yeah,
of course.

1460
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:16,640
It's specifically

1461
01:08:17,090 --> 01:08:18,470
man.
Moving

1462
01:08:20,220 --> 01:08:22,880
it specifically that you don't think
anybody has ever done this?

1463
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:24,080
I don't think so.
No.

1464
01:08:24,140 --> 01:08:26,710
In life.
Like everyone's just saying we're the

1465
01:08:26,711 --> 01:08:28,580
only country that would have the press
conference,

1466
01:08:28,581 --> 01:08:30,920
some clips,
weird clips from the press conference

1467
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:32,400
because the,
the press conference it,

1468
01:08:32,410 --> 01:08:35,480
trip you out and see and see.
Just like other,

1469
01:08:36,050 --> 01:08:39,380
you know,
countries who have the means to do it.

1470
01:08:39,381 --> 01:08:44,170
Like they're in intention about going
place in this place in medicine.

1471
01:08:44,180 --> 01:08:49,180
Go big screen.
Look how sad these guys look.

1472
01:08:49,900 --> 01:08:53,210
So we're.
This

1473
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:59,320
was our pleasure to have in one great
adventure.

1474
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:05,290
It's an adventure that took place not
just in the month of July,

1475
01:09:06,490 --> 01:09:09,310
but rather one that took place in the
last decade.

1476
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:19,200
We all hear and the people listening in
today had the opportunity to share that

1477
01:09:20,351 --> 01:09:23,860
adventure over.
It's developing an unfolding

1478
01:09:25,750 --> 01:09:30,750
in the past months and years.
It's our privilege today to share with

1479
01:09:33,341 --> 01:09:38,341
you
some of the details of that final month

1480
01:09:41,170 --> 01:09:43,810
of July.
That was

1481
01:09:45,550 --> 01:09:50,550
certainly the highlight for the three of
us have of that decade.

1482
01:09:51,650 --> 01:09:55,080
They just went to the moon and they all
looked like they just saw the naked part

1483
01:09:55,081 --> 01:09:56,680
of it.
They also have a alliance.

1484
01:09:57,320 --> 01:09:58,430
You tell him,
Neil,

1485
01:09:59,990 --> 01:10:01,880
it looks so fake,
but again,

1486
01:10:01,970 --> 01:10:06,410
that could be just extreme nerves.
It can be people that don't know how to

1487
01:10:06,411 --> 01:10:10,640
handle being in front of press.
It could be a introverts that are forced

1488
01:10:10,641 --> 01:10:12,710
on the camera,
can be a lot of issues.

1489
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:14,990
If you went to the moon and then you
came back and uh,

1490
01:10:14,991 --> 01:10:17,320
you were sitting at press conference,
would you be at the light?

1491
01:10:17,390 --> 01:10:19,640
Like what would your,
what would your actions be?

1492
01:10:19,670 --> 01:10:22,100
Would you be like?
Or would it be like more like,

1493
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:25,220
like it would be,
it would look like a,

1494
01:10:25,690 --> 01:10:28,190
like,
like a lake was a press conference after

1495
01:10:28,191 --> 01:10:32,250
they want you back.
I have my hat on champagne.

1496
01:10:32,970 --> 01:10:37,970
Just pointing to reporters.
And why did they bring back like a rock

1497
01:10:38,871 --> 01:10:40,070
or something?
Oh,

1498
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:42,050
they did.
They brought it back a lot.

1499
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:45,650
Brought back many rocks,
but some of them turned out to be

1500
01:10:45,651 --> 01:10:48,100
petrified wood.
They gave one of them too.

1501
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:55,200
Yeah.
They gave a moon rock in 69 or 72 hours.

1502
01:10:55,820 --> 01:10:58,550
The Prime Minister of Holland,
whoever it was,

1503
01:10:58,600 --> 01:10:59,121
whatever.
Who.

1504
01:10:59,121 --> 01:11:03,440
The person who runs Holland and a years
later they analyze it and it was

1505
01:11:03,441 --> 01:11:08,441
petrified wood who was not a moon rock.
In fairness.

1506
01:11:10,340 --> 01:11:12,020
In fairness,
I do get the,

1507
01:11:12,021 --> 01:11:13,980
like by the

1508
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:18,280
time we got to Holland,
the gift basket is going to change when

1509
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:22,680
I given away the real moon rocks to
Holland.

1510
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:23,491
Yeah.
Like that.

1511
01:11:23,491 --> 01:11:26,700
Like you know,
England gets some real moon rock.

1512
01:11:26,940 --> 01:11:29,350
Yeah.
France gets a little rough,

1513
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:32,090
but they get a little thing of the moon
rocks.

1514
01:11:32,140 --> 01:11:36,270
They the statute skill which you think
you got some dudes.

1515
01:11:36,780 --> 01:11:39,210
Did you think about this Mars mission?
Look,

1516
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:44,420
that's all real rovers are real.
It's all the technology's proven and

1517
01:11:44,641 --> 01:11:47,220
legitimate and I don't think you'd ever
fake anything today.

1518
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:51,030
Like you could fake things in 1969 if I
think,

1519
01:11:51,031 --> 01:11:53,820
if anything for sure.
What they did is it's been proven that

1520
01:11:53,821 --> 01:11:58,821
they faked some footage for sure.
Some photographs recorded over the

1521
01:11:59,791 --> 01:12:01,680
original.
Again,

1522
01:12:01,681 --> 01:12:05,220
those little things.
It's like you recorded over the irt.

1523
01:12:05,450 --> 01:12:07,290
Yeah.
The original in a world where even the

1524
01:12:07,291 --> 01:12:09,180
importance of syndication was known.

1525
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:14,360
I think they also lost a telemetry data,
which is like the binary hard ones and

1526
01:12:14,431 --> 01:12:18,060
Zeros that show the distance between the
earth and lunar module and every step of

1527
01:12:18,061 --> 01:12:20,070
the trip they lost it.
Yeah.

1528
01:12:20,130 --> 01:12:22,980
They lost that Shit,
you know.

1529
01:12:22,981 --> 01:12:25,440
Then again,
you gotta realize like people die and

1530
01:12:25,441 --> 01:12:28,920
people responsible for storage and no
one's paying attention and there's

1531
01:12:28,921 --> 01:12:31,580
funding and the funding gets pulled and
this,

1532
01:12:31,660 --> 01:12:34,920
this plausible reasons for some of the
house.

1533
01:12:35,190 --> 01:12:40,190
I mean there are episodes of blossom
being guarded in a vault somewhere in

1534
01:12:41,161 --> 01:12:43,750
burbank,
episodes of blossom.

1535
01:12:44,010 --> 01:12:46,320
You could get fucking money off of
blossom.

1536
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:49,200
He can't make any money off of these God
damn moon landing clips.

1537
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:51,090
Look,
there's some people that absolutely are

1538
01:12:51,091 --> 01:12:55,680
convinced that we didn't go and I used
to be one of them and I would love if

1539
01:12:55,681 --> 01:12:58,110
they proved that it was fake.
It would make me more happy than

1540
01:12:58,111 --> 01:12:59,160
anything else in the world.

1541
01:12:59,190 --> 01:13:00,930
You know what a I'll would make me very
happy.

1542
01:13:00,931 --> 01:13:03,750
So I.
The the thing that keeps me holding on

1543
01:13:03,751 --> 01:13:07,020
to maybe we went is a tour at Nasa once
and they were nice.

1544
01:13:08,490 --> 01:13:09,360
That's probably it.
Then.

1545
01:13:09,770 --> 01:13:11,820
That was nice.
But you gotta realize those aren't the

1546
01:13:11,821 --> 01:13:14,140
same people.
You know when people say like no lies.

1547
01:13:14,250 --> 01:13:17,550
Okay,
but those were NASA from 1969.

1548
01:13:17,551 --> 01:13:19,470
These are different humans.
You know,

1549
01:13:19,490 --> 01:13:21,930
you're talking about 48 fucking years
ago.

1550
01:13:21,931 --> 01:13:26,931
These are completely different humans.
They stand on the backs of lives.

1551
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:31,650
Yeah.
Well there was a list of NASA so we can

1552
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:34,770
let us ask questions if you going to
fucking lie.

1553
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:41,400
That's what you say about the tour.
Stop inviting those to NASA and allowing

1554
01:13:42,181 --> 01:13:43,740
us to ask questions.
If you're going to lie.

1555
01:13:44,940 --> 01:13:47,650
I don't think they think they're lying.
I don't think they're involved in,

1556
01:13:47,690 --> 01:13:49,320
if any.
If there was a conspiracy,

1557
01:13:49,321 --> 01:13:50,880
like say if they did fake the moon
landing.

1558
01:13:50,910 --> 01:13:53,250
No one today who's alive as a part of
that,

1559
01:13:53,940 --> 01:13:55,980
except Buzz Aldrin.
He's the only one still alive,

1560
01:13:56,580 --> 01:13:57,560
but you know,
he,

1561
01:13:57,630 --> 01:13:59,340
he just,
he punched the dude in the face,

1562
01:13:59,580 --> 01:14:02,220
punched some guy.
What did he said he was Bart seabrook

1563
01:14:02,270 --> 01:14:03,600
parts.
Seabrook made a move.

1564
01:14:03,601 --> 01:14:06,540
I had dinner with them.
Yeah,

1565
01:14:06,630 --> 01:14:09,570
yeah.
Dinner with him many years ago and back

1566
01:14:09,571 --> 01:14:13,990
when I was a full blown a moon
nonbeliever and you know,

1567
01:14:14,060 --> 01:14:18,460
I'm contacted them and got ahold of him.
Took him to dinner and

1568
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:25,010
you use your celebrity for good.
It was

1569
01:14:26,570 --> 01:14:31,300
just like these real specific pockets of
people that you just want to talk to.

1570
01:14:31,301 --> 01:14:31,690
It's like,
yeah,

1571
01:14:31,690 --> 01:14:33,250
well I wanted to do that,
but.

1572
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:37,720
So you can see someone doing interviews,
you could see someone in an edited

1573
01:14:37,721 --> 01:14:39,850
format and you kind of get a sense of
who they are.

1574
01:14:40,090 --> 01:14:43,330
You don't really get a sense of who they
are until you actually talk to them like

1575
01:14:43,331 --> 01:14:45,040
you and him sharing a plate of pasta.

1576
01:14:45,070 --> 01:14:46,990
What was this like?
What did he,

1577
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:52,080
did he give you anything that's like
gives context so like that moment or

1578
01:14:52,631 --> 01:14:55,380
like just like why did it?
Uh,

1579
01:14:55,510 --> 01:14:59,260
he was convinced he was absolutely
convinced that it was a hoax and he

1580
01:14:59,261 --> 01:15:01,060
would,
he was convinced was that there was a

1581
01:15:01,061 --> 01:15:04,920
space race between us and Russia and
that it was a,

1582
01:15:06,140 --> 01:15:08,320
it was essentially a militarized space
race.

1583
01:15:08,321 --> 01:15:11,410
And what they were trying to do is prove
military superiority.

1584
01:15:11,411 --> 01:15:14,050
If you had the rockets that could get
you to the moon,

1585
01:15:14,051 --> 01:15:19,051
your technology was superior.
And the way he framed it is like the

1586
01:15:19,690 --> 01:15:24,690
United States had control over what was
aired and they put it on television and

1587
01:15:24,701 --> 01:15:27,160
no one foresaw the future.
No one foresaw that.

1588
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:31,090
One day you would be looking at these
clips on youtube and analyzing them and

1589
01:15:31,330 --> 01:15:33,730
putting them in slow Mo.
They didn't even think that that was

1590
01:15:33,750 --> 01:15:38,340
going to be a thing on television that
works.

1591
01:15:38,380 --> 01:15:40,330
Yeah.
And They were going to show it in black

1592
01:15:40,331 --> 01:15:43,970
and white and they were going to have it
three d projected so that you would

1593
01:15:43,971 --> 01:15:48,280
project projected on a screen and then
people who were filming it would have to

1594
01:15:48,281 --> 01:15:50,830
film the screen.
Like they.

1595
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:54,070
They didn't even get a live feed when it
was airing on television.

1596
01:15:54,071 --> 01:15:57,940
It was airing people filming the screen
that it was being projected on.

1597
01:15:58,850 --> 01:16:00,250
What?
What?

1598
01:16:00,340 --> 01:16:00,910
Yeah,
yeah.

1599
01:16:00,910 --> 01:16:05,380
They broke it down.
So it looked more and more a grainy and

1600
01:16:05,381 --> 01:16:09,970
fake like they.
If you were trying to do something that

1601
01:16:09,971 --> 01:16:12,400
was not done to the technology of the
day,

1602
01:16:12,401 --> 01:16:16,180
that would possibly obscure some fraud.
They did it all those ways.

1603
01:16:16,450 --> 01:16:20,050
There's so many things that they did
that you would go.

1604
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:21,480
it's,
it's in,

1605
01:16:21,820 --> 01:16:26,290
in terms of like conspiracies.
It's a conspiracy theorists wet dream

1606
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:30,010
because if it is a fake is the biggest
fake of all time.

1607
01:16:30,250 --> 01:16:33,130
And there's so many things that are
squirrely about it.

1608
01:16:33,190 --> 01:16:35,230
There's so many things.
It doesn't mean it's fake.

1609
01:16:35,610 --> 01:16:37,750
Yeah.
But there's so many things.

1610
01:16:37,860 --> 01:16:39,880
So has anybody been to them?
No.

1611
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,060
No one's been to the moon since 1969 to
1972.

1612
01:16:43,210 --> 01:16:45,640
There was the only trips they did.
Seven attempts,

1613
01:16:45,641 --> 01:16:48,130
six of them successful.
Apollo 13 was the one that wasn't

1614
01:16:48,131 --> 01:16:49,540
successful.
That was that big movie.

1615
01:16:49,950 --> 01:16:52,480
Um,
they landed on the moon and then came

1616
01:16:52,481 --> 01:16:57,481
back seven times 262,000 miles away.
Now here's where it gets crazy.

1617
01:16:57,820 --> 01:17:00,490
Or plus or minus depending on where the
moon's out.

1618
01:17:00,510 --> 01:17:03,980
And what's crazy is 260,
2000 miles.

1619
01:17:03,981 --> 01:17:06,370
It's pretty far.
Which crazy.

1620
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:09,230
No,
no,

1621
01:17:09,260 --> 01:17:09,770
no.
My bad.

1622
01:17:09,770 --> 01:17:10,010
I'm

1623
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:10,761
thinking about,
oh,

1624
01:17:10,761 --> 01:17:15,190
that's three zeroes
because I was like,

1625
01:17:15,260 --> 01:17:20,260
what map or you see,
interesting that no other human space

1626
01:17:21,651 --> 01:17:25,640
mission where a human has been a part of
it since then has ever gone more than

1627
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:29,210
400 miles from the earth's surface is
that where the uh,

1628
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:31,580
space station,
all the space shuttle missions,

1629
01:17:31,581 --> 01:17:33,260
everything.
EverYthing was outside.

1630
01:17:33,290 --> 01:17:35,480
It was further than 400,
400 miles.

1631
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:39,560
So the guy you hAd dinner with did what?
For buzz aldrin to sock them.

1632
01:17:39,830 --> 01:17:43,820
He told buzz aldrin he was a liar.
He said you're a liar and a crook.

1633
01:17:43,821 --> 01:17:47,880
And buzz went pitch
popped him.

1634
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:48,753
right.
The job.

1635
01:17:49,940 --> 01:17:52,660
Has anyone contacted them after that?
I mean,

1636
01:17:52,670 --> 01:17:55,100
I'd imagine.
I don't know what he's doing.

1637
01:17:57,280 --> 01:17:59,720
I mean immediately after.
No,

1638
01:17:59,740 --> 01:18:00,050
no,
no.

1639
01:18:00,050 --> 01:18:02,980
The guy bart cbo.
But I mean immediately after the punch.

1640
01:18:02,981 --> 01:18:04,430
Is there any type of.
Like.

1641
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:09,230
I think he tried to press charges and
the cops told him to go fuck off.

1642
01:18:09,231 --> 01:18:10,820
I think it was one of those folks.
it was,

1643
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:14,480
it wasn't the best punch either.
I mean if you go to the hospital from

1644
01:18:14,481 --> 01:18:17,090
that punch,
buzz was like in his eighties at the

1645
01:18:17,091 --> 01:18:19,520
time.
But he tried,

1646
01:18:19,550 --> 01:18:21,740
he followed,
he harassed a lot of those guys.

1647
01:18:21,980 --> 01:18:25,370
He harassed a lot of the astronauts and
tried to get him to swear on bibles.

1648
01:18:25,730 --> 01:18:28,910
he'd bring a bible and this bible that
you want on the moon.

1649
01:18:30,010 --> 01:18:31,850
Yeah,
I mean it was.

1650
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:33,980
There was a lot of.
There's a lot of weird shit.

1651
01:18:34,220 --> 01:18:38,690
There's another one that's a 25th
anniversary of the apollo moon missions.

1652
01:18:38,691 --> 01:18:43,220
He gives a speech at the white house in
front of this group of honor roll

1653
01:18:43,221 --> 01:18:45,650
students,
like some of the best students in the

1654
01:18:45,651 --> 01:18:47,740
country near armstrong.

1655
01:18:47,780 --> 01:18:52,470
Gives us real weird fucking speech is
like we have here amongst us.

1656
01:18:52,700 --> 01:18:54,590
You want to hear it?
If I find

1657
01:18:56,250 --> 01:18:59,930
what makes it weird,
when you'll see it,

1658
01:18:59,931 --> 01:19:01,040
you'll get it.
It's just real.

1659
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:02,540
It doesn't mean we didn't go to the
moon.

1660
01:19:02,750 --> 01:19:06,870
It doesn't mean that it's fucking weird.
It's really funny because I presented it

1661
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:07,341
as like,
yeah,

1662
01:19:07,341 --> 01:19:11,850
I don't think we went and I didn't even
have half of what you're getting.

1663
01:19:12,260 --> 01:19:13,220
Oh,
I'll give you a way more.

1664
01:19:13,310 --> 01:19:14,180
there's a lot.
Watch this.

1665
01:19:14,181 --> 01:19:18,670
You're going to watch this and held back
tears as he spoke these brief.

1666
01:19:19,510 --> 01:19:21,850
This is from a funny thing happened on
the way to the moon part,

1667
01:19:21,860 --> 01:19:24,890
cbos moving,
but this is a real thing that happened

1668
01:19:25,430 --> 01:19:26,263
today.
We had

1669
01:19:27,890 --> 01:19:32,890
a group of students among america's best
to you.

1670
01:19:33,081 --> 01:19:36,650
We say we have only completed a
beginning.

1671
01:19:38,470 --> 01:19:41,870
We leave you much.
That is under.

1672
01:19:43,670 --> 01:19:45,830
There are great ideas.
Undiscovered

1673
01:19:47,340 --> 01:19:52,340
breakthroughs available to those who can
remove one of truths,

1674
01:19:53,331 --> 01:19:54,440
protective layers.

1675
01:19:56,760 --> 01:19:59,740
What he is the clock.
Okay,

1676
01:19:59,830 --> 01:20:03,850
well two things that mean a little
unfair to it and you add that fucking

1677
01:20:03,851 --> 01:20:06,910
wanker music to anything.
Everything sells incredibly creepy,

1678
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:11,060
but it's true,
but it does sound like a one of truth.

1679
01:20:11,070 --> 01:20:16,070
You're trying to
get more cryptic and you also can't get

1680
01:20:18,750 --> 01:20:21,560
more exciting.
It almost sounds like seat theorists and

1681
01:20:21,561 --> 01:20:25,380
almost kind of sounds like he's like
into the child who actually figures out

1682
01:20:25,381 --> 01:20:28,680
how to go to the fucking moon.
They're great breakthroughs for those

1683
01:20:28,681 --> 01:20:31,620
who can remove one of truce protective
layers.

1684
01:20:32,010 --> 01:20:35,850
What would you.
What would you rather the the moon

1685
01:20:35,851 --> 01:20:40,851
confession or the art kelly confession,
if you had to pick one r kelly made a

1686
01:20:41,401 --> 01:20:43,080
song.
Oh yeah.

1687
01:20:44,740 --> 01:20:48,050
I need that moon confession.
Yeah.

1688
01:20:49,030 --> 01:20:51,210
I need that movie.
Art kelly.

1689
01:20:51,950 --> 01:20:53,650
I don't need that confession.
I'm good.

1690
01:20:54,350 --> 01:20:57,860
No,
that's up to the wall.

1691
01:20:57,861 --> 01:21:01,200
Now think the law is going to have a
piece of that,

1692
01:21:02,370 --> 01:21:04,840
you know,
are kelly seems to be pretty tough lawn,

1693
01:21:05,370 --> 01:21:07,590
but the moon confession would be
fascinating.

1694
01:21:07,710 --> 01:21:12,710
I will be be excited or like a moon.
Like I dunno,

1695
01:21:14,190 --> 01:21:16,410
I guess it's not on them to prove that
they went.

1696
01:21:16,411 --> 01:21:17,700
So I'm saying like,
you know,

1697
01:21:17,701 --> 01:21:18,900
just some type of light.

1698
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:23,220
I may 19,
69.

1699
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:25,230
It's a different world.
Nixon's president,

1700
01:21:25,710 --> 01:21:27,540
I don't know if they did lie.
I don't know.

1701
01:21:28,150 --> 01:21:29,880
Yeah,
I used to think I knew a.

1702
01:21:29,881 --> 01:21:32,400
Do not think I know.
I mean it's foolish.

1703
01:21:32,460 --> 01:21:34,530
I don't know jack shit about
astrophysics,

1704
01:21:34,590 --> 01:21:37,500
but I know if there was a lie,
you know,

1705
01:21:37,501 --> 01:21:41,130
if there's any president we would guess
would be down.

1706
01:21:41,610 --> 01:21:43,610
It'd be trump.
he did tell us about it.

1707
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:44,480
Well,
know what I'm saying,

1708
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:48,370
what I'm saying?
Like I'm saying like nixon just like it.

1709
01:21:48,380 --> 01:21:52,890
It is a perfect storm of like
nixon.

1710
01:21:52,891 --> 01:21:53,641
Yeah.
Oh,

1711
01:21:53,641 --> 01:21:56,040
he's the most deceptive president of all
time except the current one.

1712
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:57,330
Yeah.
Um,

1713
01:21:57,330 --> 01:21:58,163
yeah.
It's,

1714
01:21:58,760 --> 01:21:59,593
uh,
I'm,

1715
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:02,100
I'm it.
It's very interesting.

1716
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:05,280
I,
I've shut down a lot of barbecues was

1717
01:22:05,281 --> 01:22:08,550
talking about just bringing it up.
Now you have more information.

1718
01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:11,080
And by the way,
this is a fraction of the shit that I

1719
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:11,460
did.

1720
01:22:11,460 --> 01:22:16,240
I did research for years.
I debated a,

1721
01:22:16,250 --> 01:22:19,110
uh,
scientists on penn jillette's radio show

1722
01:22:19,111 --> 01:22:20,220
about it.
How did it go?

1723
01:22:21,060 --> 01:22:25,170
Pretty good for me.
Even though I don't even agree with some

1724
01:22:25,171 --> 01:22:28,880
of the shit that I said back.
Where does that argument end on just a

1725
01:22:29,070 --> 01:22:31,440
agree to disagree?
It was a time constraint.

1726
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:34,470
I wouldn't do it far differently.
Now I think far differently now that I

1727
01:22:34,471 --> 01:22:36,390
did that,
I would not take this.

1728
01:22:36,391 --> 01:22:39,450
I know we didn't do it approach because
I don't know.

1729
01:22:39,451 --> 01:22:43,830
We didn't do it and that's the thing I.
I very casually go,

1730
01:22:44,850 --> 01:22:46,770
probably not,
but it just.

1731
01:22:46,771 --> 01:22:51,320
The things that don't add up to me don't
add up in a way that just makes me go.

1732
01:22:51,330 --> 01:22:53,010
Yeah.
Do you know about the van allen

1733
01:22:53,011 --> 01:22:54,780
radiation belts?
You know about all that?

1734
01:22:56,190 --> 01:23:00,270
Not enough to like there's a,
there's a belt of radiation,

1735
01:23:00,300 --> 01:23:02,700
like a doughnut shaped from just years
of.

1736
01:23:03,320 --> 01:23:05,990
It's just naturally surrounds the earth.
Oh,

1737
01:23:05,990 --> 01:23:07,570
you know what I'm thinking about?
I'm thinking about the.

1738
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:09,740
Nevermind.
I'm thinking about the belt of from

1739
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:12,910
years of like satellites and so there's
that shit too,

1740
01:23:12,911 --> 01:23:15,360
but that wasn't much of that in 1969.
Not near what it.

1741
01:23:15,370 --> 01:23:18,430
What about it?
The van allen radiation belts is intense

1742
01:23:18,431 --> 01:23:22,540
ban of radiation for miles that,
that surrounds the earth that you would

1743
01:23:22,541 --> 01:23:27,470
have to go through to get to the moon.
So they apparently though there's a hole

1744
01:23:27,471 --> 01:23:31,120
that you could go through and the top
with the radiation belt isn't there,

1745
01:23:31,420 --> 01:23:34,480
but the idea is that there was no
shielding to protect them from

1746
01:23:34,481 --> 01:23:37,690
radiation.
They just weren't in this aluminum tin

1747
01:23:37,691 --> 01:23:40,270
can you were touched or lunar module if
they have a.

1748
01:23:40,340 --> 01:23:44,050
There was a science exhibit I went to
once that had a,

1749
01:23:44,530 --> 01:23:47,980
a replica of the lunar module and you
can put your hands on it and it's like,

1750
01:23:47,981 --> 01:23:48,730
whoa,
this thing is,

1751
01:23:48,730 --> 01:23:53,730
oh really made a coke cans and it's like
nothing so weird looking.

1752
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:59,880
There's also like photographs that are
fucking wanky lights that go at two

1753
01:24:00,221 --> 01:24:04,810
different angles and they say,
well that's possible due to uneven

1754
01:24:04,811 --> 01:24:07,900
terrain and you know,
things reflecting off of things,

1755
01:24:07,901 --> 01:24:12,160
all these different variables.
I also really enjoy just like playing

1756
01:24:12,161 --> 01:24:17,120
around and the.
It was this houston.

1757
01:24:17,530 --> 01:24:19,050
Oh wow.
Is that a space shuttle?

1758
01:24:20,470 --> 01:24:23,540
The shuttle.
I'm you see I have a music.

1759
01:24:23,730 --> 01:24:25,120
This is.
You've seen these.

1760
01:24:25,150 --> 01:24:28,050
You're another dude that walks around
with a phone with no case on this.

1761
01:24:28,120 --> 01:24:30,500
This is me on the.
Well,

1762
01:24:31,190 --> 01:24:33,280
you don't put a case on your phone to
lose jobs.

1763
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:37,660
Died so that we could a sleekness you're
a risk taker.

1764
01:24:37,900 --> 01:24:41,320
I liked the feel of the phone.
That's neil degrasse tyson was sitting

1765
01:24:41,321 --> 01:24:45,220
in that seat 24 hours ago,
so the exact same thing he has is with

1766
01:24:45,230 --> 01:24:46,300
no case I need it.
I was like,

1767
01:24:46,301 --> 01:24:47,980
well,
we could only be here now.

1768
01:24:49,810 --> 01:24:52,390
He would go crazy on us.
He's one of the reasons why I dropped

1769
01:24:52,391 --> 01:24:53,380
it.
Talking to him.

1770
01:24:53,381 --> 01:24:54,070
I'm like,
yeah,

1771
01:24:54,070 --> 01:24:55,290
it doesn't really.
Yeah.

1772
01:24:56,270 --> 01:24:57,880
Why?
He's dedicated his whole life.

1773
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,680
So the idea of it.
Well,

1774
01:24:59,681 --> 01:25:03,610
you know what else he hasn't.
He's dedicated his whole life to

1775
01:25:03,611 --> 01:25:05,950
science,
but I know but I'm just saying like to

1776
01:25:05,951 --> 01:25:08,860
the,
like the way that like that's part of

1777
01:25:08,861 --> 01:25:10,570
it.
It's part of like the kid growing up

1778
01:25:10,590 --> 01:25:13,660
there is an adult during conspiracy
theories.

1779
01:25:13,661 --> 01:25:15,970
He's got too much other shit to think
about this real.

1780
01:25:15,971 --> 01:25:19,000
He's thinking about actual real science.
Like he doesn't have time for that

1781
01:25:19,001 --> 01:25:22,150
nonsense,
but he will aluminate you on why he

1782
01:25:22,151 --> 01:25:26,890
thinks it's stupid and it would be an
incredibly difficult task to fake that.

1783
01:25:27,460 --> 01:25:32,460
But it wouldn't be as difficult in 1969
as it would be in 2018 if you tried to

1784
01:25:32,501 --> 01:25:33,700
do that in 2018.

1785
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:38,880
Basically possible America.
I mean the tuskegee experiment existed,

1786
01:25:39,940 --> 01:25:42,160
you know what I mean?
Like it was just in a.

1787
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:44,770
Was that the six?
It went on for 20 years.

1788
01:25:44,771 --> 01:25:48,030
It was like a,
I don't know the exact number,

1789
01:25:48,031 --> 01:25:51,870
but it was like 20 years of history
where this is happening in like,

1790
01:25:52,180 --> 01:25:57,040
not like so many things can just kind of
happened under the give people syphilis

1791
01:25:57,041 --> 01:26:00,090
or did this app.
What's that?

1792
01:26:00,450 --> 01:26:04,100
I'm given bLack men syphilis.
Just like kind of like,

1793
01:26:04,550 --> 01:26:06,890
I don't even know what the research was
exactly.

1794
01:26:06,891 --> 01:26:10,160
If iT's like monitoring its effects or
if that was exactly what it was.

1795
01:26:10,170 --> 01:26:11,900
Yeah.
And it was just a.

1796
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:13,460
Yeah,
for like 20 years,

1797
01:26:13,470 --> 01:26:14,303
uh,
the,

1798
01:26:14,580 --> 01:26:18,530
the tuskegee hospital,
there are real conspiracies,

1799
01:26:18,740 --> 01:26:21,590
unquestionably,
undeniably real conspiracies.

1800
01:26:22,100 --> 01:26:25,040
Like a gulf of tonkin which got us into
the Vietnam war.

1801
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:30,590
They pretended that a ship got attacked
by North Korea or by north Vietnam.

1802
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:36,080
Was it north Vietnam?
Whatever it was by Vietnam in the south

1803
01:26:36,081 --> 01:26:39,050
pacific.
And this motivated everybody to get into

1804
01:26:39,051 --> 01:26:40,510
war with Vietnam.
Never happened.

1805
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:42,290
It's fake.
Made it up.

1806
01:26:43,340 --> 01:26:45,860
Operation northwoods.
Nineteen 62,

1807
01:26:45,890 --> 01:26:49,730
signed by the joint chiefs of staff
vetoed by president kennedy.

1808
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:55,120
It was a a signed order where they were
going to plan out fake attacks on

1809
01:26:55,881 --> 01:26:58,640
America.
They were going to launch a drone

1810
01:26:58,641 --> 01:27:01,100
jetliner,
blow it up in the air and blame it on

1811
01:27:01,101 --> 01:27:03,650
Cuba.
They were going to arm cuban friendly's

1812
01:27:03,651 --> 01:27:07,070
and have them attack guantanamo bay.
They're going to pay them,

1813
01:27:07,071 --> 01:27:11,330
arm them to attack guantanamo bay,
and then it would give us the motivation

1814
01:27:11,331 --> 01:27:14,420
to go to war with Cuba.
This was all signed by the joint chiefs

1815
01:27:14,421 --> 01:27:15,860
of staff.
They're going to sacrifice american

1816
01:27:15,861 --> 01:27:17,510
lives.
They're going to kill americans.

1817
01:27:17,780 --> 01:27:20,840
They were going to have people attack
americans and they were going to blame

1818
01:27:20,841 --> 01:27:23,810
it on the cubans and they were
orchestrating it all to get people

1819
01:27:23,811 --> 01:27:25,490
motivated for a war with Cuba.

1820
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:27,440
And president kennedy came along and
said,

1821
01:27:27,441 --> 01:27:31,940
what in the fuck are you talking about?
And he vetoed it and stopped it,

1822
01:27:32,150 --> 01:27:35,960
and a year later he was dead,
was one of the things that he did.

1823
01:27:36,860 --> 01:27:40,310
One of the things that he did that lead
many people to believe that there was a

1824
01:27:40,311 --> 01:27:44,420
conspiracy that he was murdered.
That's a good one to the lee harvey

1825
01:27:44,421 --> 01:27:49,421
oswald case is a fascinating one.
Lee harveys murder Is the shady is

1826
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:54,230
looking at
jack ruby.

1827
01:27:55,380 --> 01:27:58,420
It was like.
It was like a motion picture of like,

1828
01:27:58,440 --> 01:28:01,880
like just with a director,
like a b movie director.

1829
01:28:01,881 --> 01:28:02,810
Yeah.
Yeah.

1830
01:28:02,811 --> 01:28:06,230
It really was.
A lot happened with lee harvey oswald

1831
01:28:06,231 --> 01:28:07,700
captured by the cops.
He says,

1832
01:28:07,701 --> 01:28:09,650
I'm a patsy,
you know this just.

1833
01:28:09,740 --> 01:28:11,270
I didn't do anything,
and they're.

1834
01:28:11,340 --> 01:28:13,000
They're walking him.
They're holding onto them.

1835
01:28:13,020 --> 01:28:13,760
By the way,
he,

1836
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:16,130
he's behaving like a guy who got framed.

1837
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:19,760
He's not behaving like a guy who just
shot the president and they're walking

1838
01:28:19,761 --> 01:28:22,460
with him.
This is after he said he was a patsy.

1839
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:26,090
They're walking with him through the
courtyard and jack ruby who was a mob

1840
01:28:26,091 --> 01:28:28,160
guy,
walks right up to him and shoot him in

1841
01:28:28,161 --> 01:28:31,400
front of everybody.
Jack ruby was a nightclub owner who was

1842
01:28:31,910 --> 01:28:33,860
shot to the model.
Look at the shot.

1843
01:28:33,910 --> 01:28:34,790
Yeah,
watch this.

1844
01:28:35,060 --> 01:28:37,580
He's walking.
They look how they have them too.

1845
01:28:37,581 --> 01:28:39,410
It's almost like shot,
bang.

1846
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:40,820
Just walks up to him.
They grabbed them.

1847
01:28:40,821 --> 01:28:42,130
Hey,
you cut it out there,

1848
01:28:42,150 --> 01:28:44,840
mr.
It looks like it's playing on turner.

1849
01:28:44,841 --> 01:28:46,310
Classic movies.
It does.

1850
01:28:46,311 --> 01:28:49,150
So you could add music to this resident
with the edit,

1851
01:28:49,230 --> 01:28:52,580
like gimme some volume jamie,
and play that from the beginning.

1852
01:28:52,970 --> 01:28:54,450
See,
let me see him walking again.

1853
01:28:54,470 --> 01:28:56,030
Give me some volume.
We hear this,

1854
01:28:59,540 --> 01:29:04,540
but look at these.
You're walking them through.

1855
01:29:04,700 --> 01:29:07,670
But look how the cops are like way on
the outside too.

1856
01:29:07,671 --> 01:29:08,060
I don't know.

1857
01:29:08,060 --> 01:29:11,950
Shot.
They'll look how they're holding them.

1858
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:26,240
Here's a man with a gun.
Never shot another round.

1859
01:29:27,170 --> 01:29:29,030
One round kills them

1860
01:29:30,700 --> 01:29:34,830
and that's it.
Very strange.

1861
01:29:35,070 --> 01:29:38,070
Strange place to even.
where did he shoot him?

1862
01:29:38,100 --> 01:29:40,530
The guts,
you know,

1863
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:43,140
like in the movies.
It's just weird.

1864
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:46,290
Even the way he drew his go was very
like,

1865
01:29:46,980 --> 01:29:48,120
yeah,
I think.

1866
01:29:48,570 --> 01:29:51,000
I think there's probably many people
involved in that murder.

1867
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:52,921
Very,
very,

1868
01:29:52,921 --> 01:29:54,000
very likely.
You know,

1869
01:29:54,010 --> 01:29:57,180
this is a cruder film.
Didn't get played on tv to 1:10 years

1870
01:29:57,181 --> 01:29:59,480
after the assassination.
That was,

1871
01:29:59,650 --> 01:30:00,630
you know,
who played it?

1872
01:30:01,170 --> 01:30:06,170
Dick gregory.
Dick gregory got a out of that film and

1873
01:30:06,391 --> 01:30:09,170
he brought it to the geraldo rivera show
in like,

1874
01:30:09,240 --> 01:30:12,960
what was it,
like 1970 something as I think the.

1875
01:30:12,970 --> 01:30:17,970
The murder was in 63 and I think he
brought it on the geraldo rivera show

1876
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:21,000
75.
How about that?

1877
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:23,440
Hey man.
And you know what and knowing that it

1878
01:30:23,441 --> 01:30:27,250
played on a geraldo more than makes up
for the al capone's vault.

1879
01:30:28,520 --> 01:30:30,920
Geraldo used to be legit.
Man is a guy.

1880
01:30:31,070 --> 01:30:36,070
People don't realize geraldo was super
legit journalist who's amazing.

1881
01:30:36,470 --> 01:30:38,420
Dear dick.
Gregory was amazing.

1882
01:30:38,421 --> 01:30:41,300
I mean he was an activist before anybody
even knew what the fuck that man and as

1883
01:30:41,301 --> 01:30:44,780
a comedian for him to be appearing on
this show,

1884
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:46,310
geraldo rivera,
beautiful hair.

1885
01:30:46,490 --> 01:30:50,810
God look at his hair and dick gregory
look young and handsome and he brings

1886
01:30:50,811 --> 01:30:52,700
this out and explains to people,
hey,

1887
01:30:52,730 --> 01:30:57,200
it is highly likely that the president
got shot from the front and look at his

1888
01:30:57,201 --> 01:30:58,670
head.
Go back into the left.

1889
01:30:58,671 --> 01:31:02,060
You see his brain spray and the blood
spray out of his head.

1890
01:31:02,600 --> 01:31:03,920
It's crazy.
When they played it,

1891
01:31:03,950 --> 01:31:08,810
people were stunned and you could
clearly see him grabbing his neck,

1892
01:31:09,110 --> 01:31:12,890
like you could see the whole thing.
It's a fucked up video and it's amazing

1893
01:31:12,891 --> 01:31:16,010
that if we didn't have this video,
we would probably have a completely

1894
01:31:16,011 --> 01:31:17,600
different narrative of what happened at
kennedy.

1895
01:31:17,601 --> 01:31:22,601
One guy with one camera opened up the
possibility that there was a massive

1896
01:31:22,791 --> 01:31:27,230
conspiracy that killed the president and
it led to the release of countless books

1897
01:31:27,410 --> 01:31:28,910
and so much speculation.

1898
01:31:28,950 --> 01:31:29,790
How,
uh,

1899
01:31:29,850 --> 01:31:33,090
how many files are still,
like,

1900
01:31:33,091 --> 01:31:35,730
what's the timestamp before all the
files were on the case?

1901
01:31:36,420 --> 01:31:38,190
Well,
some of them were released,

1902
01:31:38,220 --> 01:31:41,430
fairly came out like last year,
maybe even this year.

1903
01:31:41,500 --> 01:31:42,690
And I don't even remember it.
Look at that.

1904
01:31:42,691 --> 01:31:43,950
Boom.
Back into the left.

1905
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:46,110
I don't remember what the conclusion
was.

1906
01:31:46,140 --> 01:31:47,010
Oh,
I just missed it.

1907
01:31:47,020 --> 01:31:47,650
Rewind it.

1908
01:31:47,650 --> 01:31:48,940
Yeah.
So greeny.

1909
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:50,560
Yeah.
Here.

1910
01:31:50,750 --> 01:31:52,390
Watch back into the left.
Watch here,

1911
01:31:52,450 --> 01:31:57,060
eddie.
Here comes the spray.

1912
01:31:57,690 --> 01:31:59,070
Bang.
Oh shit.

1913
01:31:59,410 --> 01:32:02,080
Yeah.
The way his head throws back,

1914
01:32:02,290 --> 01:32:04,900
it seems very likely that he was hit
from the front.

1915
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:10,030
However,
it's also possible that he was hit from

1916
01:32:10,031 --> 01:32:12,730
the back and that his body just spasm
that way.

1917
01:32:13,590 --> 01:32:14,320
You don't,
I mean,

1918
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:15,160
no one really knows.

1919
01:32:15,550 --> 01:32:18,360
Have you seen jackie the movie jackie?
No,

1920
01:32:19,380 --> 01:32:22,650
theY captured.
He captures like that moment,

1921
01:32:22,680 --> 01:32:24,090
you know,
it's for the film,

1922
01:32:24,091 --> 01:32:25,880
but it in such a,
like,

1923
01:32:27,130 --> 01:32:30,420
it's a beautiful,
really beautifully captured moment that

1924
01:32:30,421 --> 01:32:33,900
he kind of plays throughout the film.
That's just for that alone.

1925
01:32:33,901 --> 01:32:37,320
I thought the movie was beautiful in a
very underrated,

1926
01:32:37,321 --> 01:32:38,250
but I,
uh,

1927
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:41,070
but it captured it really well.
Yeah,

1928
01:32:41,071 --> 01:32:42,380
it's a,
it's a crazy

1929
01:32:42,390 --> 01:32:43,650
moment in history.
You know,

1930
01:32:43,710 --> 01:32:45,840
they assassinated the president.
It was caught on film.

1931
01:32:46,350 --> 01:32:49,230
But again,
if dick gregory didn't get that video

1932
01:32:49,231 --> 01:32:52,190
footage to geraldo rivera,
is this in the movie like,

1933
01:32:52,440 --> 01:32:55,960
oh jesus christ.
It's.

1934
01:32:56,600 --> 01:32:57,433
Yeah,
it's,

1935
01:32:57,520 --> 01:33:00,200
it's crazy.
was she picking up his mouth?

1936
01:33:00,270 --> 01:33:01,680
That's not true.
You know,

1937
01:33:01,681 --> 01:33:05,200
lenny bruce had a whole fucking bid a
little bit.

1938
01:33:05,220 --> 01:33:07,560
I'm juSt saying as they tried to say
that she was picking up his brain,

1939
01:33:07,561 --> 01:33:09,640
she was running away.
She,

1940
01:33:09,680 --> 01:33:12,900
she knew he was dead and she was
escaping.

1941
01:33:12,901 --> 01:33:17,901
She was climbing off the back of the car
to escape and then the secret service is

1942
01:33:18,661 --> 01:33:21,080
behind her and they tried to help her
down.

1943
01:33:21,470 --> 01:33:24,660
Yeah.
Crazy dude.

1944
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:26,910
There's also the difference in the
autopsy,

1945
01:33:27,060 --> 01:33:30,990
the autopsy and the autopsy in dallas,
the way they.

1946
01:33:31,020 --> 01:33:34,190
The way they examined his wounds and
dallas versus the way they described in

1947
01:33:34,260 --> 01:33:36,510
bethesda,
Maryland when they flew him to that

1948
01:33:36,511 --> 01:33:37,200
hospital.

1949
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:38,600
Completely different.
Really?

1950
01:33:38,610 --> 01:33:39,031
Yeah.
Yeah.

1951
01:33:39,031 --> 01:33:39,490
They,
they,

1952
01:33:39,490 --> 01:33:41,820
they turned the entry wound into the
neck,

1953
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:45,270
which they said was a bullet hole.
They turned that into a tracheotomy

1954
01:33:45,300 --> 01:33:49,170
wound.
They change the way they thought.

1955
01:33:49,171 --> 01:33:51,810
The entrance wound to the head was.
Yeah.

1956
01:33:51,811 --> 01:33:56,811
There's a lot of weird fuckery that went
on between dallas and Maryland and then

1957
01:33:57,001 --> 01:34:00,990
there was also generals in the room that
were there that wouldn't allow doctors

1958
01:34:00,991 --> 01:34:05,991
to come and do certain parts of the
autopsy is a lot of weird shit.

1959
01:34:06,540 --> 01:34:08,610
Wow.
You mean also the president,

1960
01:34:08,611 --> 01:34:10,740
you have to realize the present United
States is shot.

1961
01:34:10,741 --> 01:34:12,220
It's top secret.
They didn't know.

1962
01:34:13,770 --> 01:34:17,050
Just like to not have the files lineup
up,

1963
01:34:17,051 --> 01:34:19,590
but then release both when.
When would they released?

1964
01:34:19,591 --> 01:34:20,424
Like,

1965
01:34:20,460 --> 01:34:23,760
there's a great book on it.
The book's called best evidenced by a

1966
01:34:23,761 --> 01:34:27,960
guy named david lipton and I fucked up
once and read this book before I went on

1967
01:34:27,961 --> 01:34:29,350
stage.
I was a,

1968
01:34:29,950 --> 01:34:34,260
I was working in philly and uh,
I was on the road.

1969
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:36,450
It was like,
you know,

1970
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:38,730
I was young and uh,
I didn't understand like,

1971
01:34:38,731 --> 01:34:40,890
you gotta put yourself in a good frame
of mind for you do stand up.

1972
01:34:41,130 --> 01:34:43,560
And I was reading this book,
freaking the fuck out.

1973
01:34:43,561 --> 01:34:44,550
I was like,
oh my god,

1974
01:34:44,551 --> 01:34:46,590
they shot the president.
ThIs is real.

1975
01:34:46,591 --> 01:34:48,840
They killed the goddamn president.
And I went on stage,

1976
01:34:48,841 --> 01:34:53,841
like super bummed out
at the club.

1977
01:34:54,600 --> 01:34:58,010
I'm like,
I'm so sorry tomorrow because I was

1978
01:34:58,010 --> 01:34:59,000
there for the whole weekend.
I'm like,

1979
01:34:59,001 --> 01:35:00,170
I read this book.
And she's like,

1980
01:35:00,171 --> 01:35:01,380
don't read that book.
Tomorrow's like,

1981
01:35:01,390 --> 01:35:05,220
I won't go on stage.
But doubt is the.

1982
01:35:07,580 --> 01:35:09,160
Go ahead.
Oh yeah,

1983
01:35:09,170 --> 01:35:10,010
that,
that,

1984
01:35:10,060 --> 01:35:13,130
that before I went up.
I remember one time,

1985
01:35:14,190 --> 01:35:17,150
uh,
it was the craziest set.

1986
01:35:17,390 --> 01:35:20,630
I'm at baltimore,
a comedy factory,

1987
01:35:20,930 --> 01:35:23,750
which is already,
you know,

1988
01:35:23,780 --> 01:35:27,140
just with my style,
that club already shouldn't be a thing

1989
01:35:27,170 --> 01:35:32,170
that happens.
Whatever it up there.

1990
01:35:39,190 --> 01:35:44,190
And also my friend angelo had just
passed away and I was going through,

1991
01:35:44,720 --> 01:35:46,000
we were talking about like kind of
those,

1992
01:35:46,020 --> 01:35:48,380
the pr.
I was like trying to make sense of that.

1993
01:35:49,340 --> 01:35:53,180
Coupled with it was that right after
christmas and the holidays.

1994
01:35:53,181 --> 01:35:58,181
So I hadn't gone up for a few weeks.
So a rusty depressed after baltimore

1995
01:35:59,180 --> 01:36:01,200
cavity factor,
uh,

1996
01:36:01,230 --> 01:36:05,360
you know,
is a combination that lead to like,

1997
01:36:05,420 --> 01:36:06,470
it,
it almost,

1998
01:36:06,471 --> 01:36:09,380
uh,
I remember experiencing it from up here.

1999
01:36:10,280 --> 01:36:11,930
You know what I mean?
Like it's one of those things that you

2000
01:36:11,931 --> 01:36:15,170
experienced where you're just like,
you're just kind of looking down at it.

2001
01:36:15,171 --> 01:36:17,960
Just like
a

2002
01:36:19,790 --> 01:36:21,680
terrible.
Yeah.

2003
01:36:21,710 --> 01:36:22,600
No,
I mean,

2004
01:36:23,570 --> 01:36:25,220
especially if you're,
you know,

2005
01:36:25,780 --> 01:36:29,900
if who you are and your act is so
reliant upon having fun.

2006
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:30,621
Yeah.
Or,

2007
01:36:30,621 --> 01:36:32,250
or a truth to,
you know,

2008
01:36:32,300 --> 01:36:35,360
the presentation is a certain.
It has a certain amount of truth to it.

2009
01:36:35,380 --> 01:36:37,100
Right.
Where you are right now,

2010
01:36:37,390 --> 01:36:39,230
you are on your mind,
which is,

2011
01:36:39,410 --> 01:36:44,410
which is also a thing always have to
guard for me because it's so a really

2012
01:36:44,781 --> 01:36:45,800
absorb,
absorb,

2013
01:36:45,801 --> 01:36:50,801
absorb.
So like I'm reacting to it and by

2014
01:36:51,290 --> 01:36:56,290
exactly how I feel right now.
I worked with jb smooth once we were

2015
01:36:58,071 --> 01:37:03,071
working in a club or a college in New
Jersey and it was real hard to get to.

2016
01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:05,810
And this was back before gps.

2017
01:37:06,330 --> 01:37:08,270
We just had directions written down on
paper,

2018
01:37:08,630 --> 01:37:10,670
you know,
and he was real late,

2019
01:37:10,850 --> 01:37:14,720
like a half hour late plus maybe even
more.

2020
01:37:14,840 --> 01:37:16,340
And the show was supposed to start at
eight.

2021
01:37:16,341 --> 01:37:19,130
It was already 8:30 and he wasn't there.
So they said,

2022
01:37:19,131 --> 01:37:21,290
look,
I'm just have a seat in the green room

2023
01:37:21,291 --> 01:37:22,480
and wait.
And you know,

2024
01:37:22,550 --> 01:37:24,290
when he gets here we'll put them on.
So I go,

2025
01:37:24,291 --> 01:37:26,390
okay,
so I have a seat in the green room and

2026
01:37:26,391 --> 01:37:31,391
I'm watching this show and it's a
documentary on these fires in malibu

2027
01:37:31,850 --> 01:37:36,850
that devastated malibu back then and,
and fucking burnt all these houses down.

2028
01:37:37,791 --> 01:37:41,360
And these people are weeping and crying
and they're looking for their dog.

2029
01:37:41,361 --> 01:37:43,310
They're like rusty,
rusty,

2030
01:37:43,640 --> 01:37:47,030
and then this guy,
he's a firefighter and he comes out and

2031
01:37:47,031 --> 01:37:50,510
he didn't even lose his house.
He was just taking care of all these

2032
01:37:50,511 --> 01:37:53,270
people that did lose their houses and he
built this house and it was like his

2033
01:37:53,271 --> 01:37:56,340
life savings and he's just.
And his neighbors house has gone,

2034
01:37:56,340 --> 01:37:58,890
his house was spared and he's just
weeping.

2035
01:37:58,950 --> 01:38:01,980
This guy's just openly weeping.
And then the,

2036
01:38:01,981 --> 01:38:04,020
uh,
director of entertainment,

2037
01:38:04,021 --> 01:38:05,550
whatever it is for the college comes in
and goes,

2038
01:38:05,551 --> 01:38:07,260
well,
jamie's not here yet.

2039
01:38:07,261 --> 01:38:10,460
So I guess you'll just go on first and
when he gets here you go,

2040
01:38:10,890 --> 01:38:12,900
okay,
so we're going to bring you up now.

2041
01:38:12,901 --> 01:38:13,734
Okay.
I was like,

2042
01:38:13,980 --> 01:38:17,650
okay.
And I just went up and just a shit.

2043
01:38:17,960 --> 01:38:19,320
Yes.
So depressed.

2044
01:38:19,321 --> 01:38:24,321
Just thinking about this fire and all
these people burning dogs and you know.

2045
01:38:24,450 --> 01:38:27,600
Did you talk about that?
I was terrible at the time.

2046
01:38:27,601 --> 01:38:31,750
I didn't know what he was doing.
Some comedy is that moment when you,

2047
01:38:31,770 --> 01:38:33,630
when you're a young comic you want to be
doing.

2048
01:38:33,690 --> 01:38:35,550
At the time I had been doing comedy like
four years.

2049
01:38:35,730 --> 01:38:38,730
When you,
when I would go down with the ship for

2050
01:38:38,731 --> 01:38:40,500
years in,
there was no coming back,

2051
01:38:40,770 --> 01:38:42,660
like once I bombed,
if I was,

2052
01:38:42,661 --> 01:38:44,850
if I was doing pretty good and then I
started bombing,

2053
01:38:45,060 --> 01:38:46,830
there was no recovery.
Yeah.

2054
01:38:46,831 --> 01:38:47,820
I never recovered.
uh,

2055
01:38:47,870 --> 01:38:49,290
this was just like,
there's no.

2056
01:38:49,291 --> 01:38:51,660
I've already given you my best.
Well iT's also,

2057
01:38:51,690 --> 01:38:54,300
I just didn't have the,
I didn't have the mindset.

2058
01:38:54,480 --> 01:38:58,700
I didn't know how to recover and didn't
know how to step back and reassess and

2059
01:38:58,720 --> 01:39:01,540
thinking about these fires.
I was so depressed a lot.

2060
01:39:01,590 --> 01:39:03,750
It's a lot.
you just can't watch something like that

2061
01:39:03,751 --> 01:39:04,300
before you go on

2062
01:39:04,300 --> 01:39:05,071
stay.
Yeah.

2063
01:39:05,071 --> 01:39:07,030
I mean,
and then also,

2064
01:39:07,031 --> 01:39:10,810
you know,
it's also about learning thing of how to

2065
01:39:10,900 --> 01:39:13,820
find the best of where you are.
Yeah.

2066
01:39:13,870 --> 01:39:15,190
Type of thing.
But yeah,

2067
01:39:15,220 --> 01:39:17,460
before having that stay out of the weeds
man,

2068
01:39:18,850 --> 01:39:20,740
don't talk to anybody.
That's depressing.

2069
01:39:20,741 --> 01:39:23,710
I don't do anything depressing.
Yeah.

2070
01:39:23,980 --> 01:39:26,680
Well people like to talk like more than
that.

2071
01:39:26,770 --> 01:39:30,190
I'm actually more effected by,
you know,

2072
01:39:30,191 --> 01:39:33,340
I remember starting out and going to
clubs and like people,

2073
01:39:33,820 --> 01:39:34,760
you know,
the booker,

2074
01:39:34,780 --> 01:39:39,100
whatever likes to come in and give you
the rundown of the room and the whatever

2075
01:39:39,101 --> 01:39:43,450
and I'm really bad at.
I'm bad at like don't get me the info,

2076
01:39:43,470 --> 01:39:47,050
like again,
like allow me to react to whatever is

2077
01:39:47,051 --> 01:39:50,630
out there and whatever's going on and
you don't need that thing.

2078
01:39:50,830 --> 01:39:53,680
LeT it get in my head as I'm in my head.

2079
01:39:54,120 --> 01:39:54,960
You don't want to hear,
okay,

2080
01:39:54,961 --> 01:39:58,680
there's a bachelor party in table two
and they're really rowdy and we're going

2081
01:39:58,681 --> 01:40:01,290
to try to talk to them first.
So just just,

2082
01:40:01,300 --> 01:40:02,780
you know,
to react to that.

2083
01:40:02,790 --> 01:40:03,800
You do it.
Yeah.

2084
01:40:03,880 --> 01:40:05,640
Yeah.
They'll tell you this as you're being

2085
01:40:05,641 --> 01:40:09,870
introduced to hold your arm drop.
Just want to let you know we've got it.

2086
01:40:09,960 --> 01:40:11,350
We're going to handle it.
The bench party,

2087
01:40:11,370 --> 01:40:12,203
you've got it under control

2088
01:40:12,660 --> 01:40:15,110
like they do it on.
I mean if you don't,

2089
01:40:15,111 --> 01:40:17,340
you know,
you're doing press for certain things.

2090
01:40:17,341 --> 01:40:21,000
Like most things like try and do like a
pre interview and the thing and it's all

2091
01:40:21,001 --> 01:40:24,330
just these things that like just rings

2092
01:40:24,540 --> 01:40:26,440
anything,
organic realness,

2093
01:40:28,170 --> 01:40:32,280
spontaneity,
squeezed out by three interviews.

2094
01:40:32,320 --> 01:40:34,320
So just doing it with a producer and
like.

2095
01:40:34,321 --> 01:40:36,060
Do you have any stories?
Funny stories?

2096
01:40:36,660 --> 01:40:41,520
I don't know.
I'm not sure the worst you've ever gone

2097
01:40:41,521 --> 01:40:43,860
on one of those radio shows where they
want you to do your bits.

2098
01:40:44,190 --> 01:40:45,150
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

2099
01:40:45,210 --> 01:40:47,350
Oh,
there's somebody's record.

2100
01:40:47,351 --> 01:40:51,690
There's some great six.
Am me in Indiana?

2101
01:40:51,900 --> 01:40:53,510
Just refusing

2102
01:40:54,190 --> 01:40:55,660
bob and tom show.
Did you do that?

2103
01:40:55,661 --> 01:40:56,830
I think I did.
Bob and tom.

2104
01:40:56,831 --> 01:41:01,810
I'm pretty sure I did that too.
And the lady got very angry at me.

2105
01:41:01,870 --> 01:41:02,800
Yeah,
yeah,

2106
01:41:02,850 --> 01:41:03,870
yeah.
It's like why would I,

2107
01:41:03,900 --> 01:41:06,390
why would I do that?
Yeah.

2108
01:41:06,750 --> 01:41:08,100
I think it was a lady might've been
dude,

2109
01:41:08,260 --> 01:41:09,530
but you know,
like it is,

2110
01:41:09,650 --> 01:41:12,060
but giving,
it all goes to like perception.

2111
01:41:12,061 --> 01:41:16,890
Like they,
what people make of comedians,

2112
01:41:17,970 --> 01:41:21,120
you know,
and what the expectations on when you go

2113
01:41:21,121 --> 01:41:23,700
out and you do these things like what
people's expectations are.

2114
01:41:24,090 --> 01:41:27,460
Like you gotta like you,
you,

2115
01:41:27,690 --> 01:41:31,470
it's up to you to like change it,
like to change that thing.

2116
01:41:31,471 --> 01:41:32,251
It's just like,
all right,

2117
01:41:32,251 --> 01:41:33,870
well look.
Hey bob and tom.

2118
01:41:34,810 --> 01:41:36,240
Yeah.
Nice guys.

2119
01:41:36,450 --> 01:41:38,640
People do the,
the bits.

2120
01:41:38,670 --> 01:41:42,410
That's just not a thing that I do have a
conversation now.

2121
01:41:42,450 --> 01:41:45,840
You need to attend to the conversation
can be interesting.

2122
01:41:45,841 --> 01:41:47,100
Yeah,
that's crazy.

2123
01:41:47,130 --> 01:41:48,780
Yeah.
And it's like a,

2124
01:41:48,920 --> 01:41:49,890
you know,
again,

2125
01:41:49,891 --> 01:41:54,420
like it's not even that they do it,
it's like it has to be tailored to you.

2126
01:41:54,510 --> 01:41:58,230
You can't do the thing.
You can't just fill into the mold of

2127
01:41:58,231 --> 01:41:59,640
comedian,
you know,

2128
01:41:59,650 --> 01:42:02,250
it was just going to make the exact same
thing over and over.

2129
01:42:02,350 --> 01:42:05,110
Well the art forms is very
underappreciated because it seems that

2130
01:42:05,111 --> 01:42:06,850
we're just talking,
you know,

2131
01:42:06,851 --> 01:42:09,460
it seems like exactly what I talked to
you talk,

2132
01:42:09,490 --> 01:42:10,700
I talk,
but you know,

2133
01:42:10,710 --> 01:42:14,720
it's not like we all play guitar.
So you see someone go up on your frIends

2134
01:42:14,721 --> 01:42:16,660
from back home.
they do a pretty good.

2135
01:42:17,320 --> 01:42:19,570
Exactly.
Because everybody's been funny at one

2136
01:42:19,571 --> 01:42:22,330
point in time,
we've all hung around with somebody who

2137
01:42:22,331 --> 01:42:26,560
said some hilarious shit and you know,
and that feels good.

2138
01:42:26,620 --> 01:42:28,240
Right?
It feels good when they do that.

2139
01:42:28,270 --> 01:42:30,820
Then when they say that and they get
that feeling like,

2140
01:42:30,821 --> 01:42:32,170
damn,
I just made everybody laugh.

2141
01:42:32,500 --> 01:42:35,740
We've all felt that chasing probably
felt that before we ever did comedy.

2142
01:42:36,130 --> 01:42:40,090
So they see you on stage and they see
you killing and they say,

2143
01:42:40,720 --> 01:42:43,510
I could do that shit.
He's doing that.

2144
01:42:43,540 --> 01:42:45,640
He's doing what I do.
I could do that.

2145
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:48,080
Then they get it in their head,
their head to market,

2146
01:42:48,100 --> 01:42:50,080
do it.
Why the fuck can't I do it?

2147
01:42:50,670 --> 01:42:53,050
They get in their head like he's just
talking.

2148
01:42:53,200 --> 01:42:57,890
He's not doing backflips.
He's surfing waves,

2149
01:42:59,110 --> 01:43:02,770
but you know what I mean.
You what you're doing is stuff they do.

2150
01:43:03,130 --> 01:43:03,963
I had it.

2151
01:43:04,030 --> 01:43:06,180
I had a cousin like,
you know,

2152
01:43:06,181 --> 01:43:07,690
I'll bring it to her and jeremy,
our

2153
01:43:09,210 --> 01:43:10,510
cousins out,
whatever.

2154
01:43:10,511 --> 01:43:12,340
I'll bring them out to like the clubs
sometimes.

2155
01:43:12,370 --> 01:43:15,850
whatever.
Bomb to an open mic one time ain't no.

2156
01:43:15,860 --> 01:43:17,970
I go up and say,
hey man,

2157
01:43:17,971 --> 01:43:19,600
it's the open mic man.
If y'all want to go up,

2158
01:43:19,601 --> 01:43:20,470
I was like,
you should.

2159
01:43:20,500 --> 01:43:21,880
Yeah,
it was mostly my boys do it.

2160
01:43:22,220 --> 01:43:23,350
Whatever.
So uh,

2161
01:43:23,380 --> 01:43:25,020
my cousin jeremy was like,
yeah,

2162
01:43:25,030 --> 01:43:26,110
I'll do it.
Whatever.

2163
01:43:26,620 --> 01:43:30,610
And uh,
do that shit gets up and he does good.

2164
01:43:30,950 --> 01:43:32,410
He's a funny dude,
you know.

2165
01:43:32,740 --> 01:43:34,390
And I was like,
all right man,

2166
01:43:34,450 --> 01:43:36,400
do that shit everyday for 10 years.

2167
01:43:42,300 --> 01:43:44,370
Look,
the reality is some people are good.

2168
01:43:44,371 --> 01:43:45,570
I'm sure.
You know,

2169
01:43:47,040 --> 01:43:49,470
some comedians started just by me.
I can do this shit

2170
01:43:50,500 --> 01:43:52,530
great at great at it and

2171
01:43:52,570 --> 01:43:53,331
you know,
and like,

2172
01:43:53,331 --> 01:43:55,280
and that can happen.
It's just that uh,

2173
01:43:55,970 --> 01:43:58,670
if you are going to do it like,
like anything,

2174
01:43:58,790 --> 01:44:00,180
you know,
if it is like the,

2175
01:44:00,740 --> 01:44:03,170
what you're choosing,
it's just like make sure that the

2176
01:44:03,171 --> 01:44:07,280
articulation is yours.
An interest in,

2177
01:44:07,910 --> 01:44:09,890
you know what I mean?
Like I think that's kind of the goal.

2178
01:44:09,891 --> 01:44:13,100
Like what however you get into it or
whatever inspired it or whatever.

2179
01:44:13,101 --> 01:44:14,930
Like if you are doing it,
do it,

2180
01:44:16,250 --> 01:44:19,250
do it and do it at its highest level if
you can.

2181
01:44:19,610 --> 01:44:20,750
Yeah.
It's just,

2182
01:44:20,930 --> 01:44:24,470
I think stand up what you were saying.
It just doesn't get the respect that

2183
01:44:24,471 --> 01:44:28,850
other art forms get because there's no,
there's no like if you see someone play

2184
01:44:28,851 --> 01:44:30,410
guitar,
I play the drums or something like that.

2185
01:44:30,411 --> 01:44:32,930
You don't have any illusion that you can
go up and do exactly what they do,

2186
01:44:33,310 --> 01:44:37,670
but a lot of people have the illusion in
their mind that they can go on stage and

2187
01:44:37,671 --> 01:44:38,390
be funny.

2188
01:44:38,390 --> 01:44:40,880
Yeah,
because they're just talking to eva or

2189
01:44:40,881 --> 01:44:44,990
even just be interesting to be in.
You don't have to be anything in the

2190
01:44:44,991 --> 01:44:45,824
room,
but it's.

2191
01:44:45,940 --> 01:44:49,580
But a lot of it,
part of the reason for the perception is

2192
01:44:49,581 --> 01:44:51,610
the things that we accept.
Yeah,

2193
01:44:52,340 --> 01:44:56,120
it really is that like a lot of the
things that we accept contribute to.

2194
01:44:56,850 --> 01:44:57,830
Oh yeah.
Hey,

2195
01:44:58,480 --> 01:45:03,480
we make it like we allow ourselves to be
presented like court justice.

2196
01:45:05,400 --> 01:45:06,560
YeAh.
Well,

2197
01:45:06,561 --> 01:45:08,930
and it's also,
it's one of the rare things that anybody

2198
01:45:08,931 --> 01:45:10,340
can try.
Right?

2199
01:45:10,341 --> 01:45:15,341
You can go up open mic night and try and
while you're up there doing stand up,

2200
01:45:16,490 --> 01:45:19,810
somebody who's a professional might drop
in and popping,

2201
01:45:19,820 --> 01:45:21,590
you know,
chappelle might show up and do a set.

2202
01:45:21,620 --> 01:45:24,020
Jeff ross might go up there dot merera,
might show up,

2203
01:45:24,200 --> 01:45:27,710
people show up and do sats and share the
stage with you.

2204
01:45:27,960 --> 01:45:31,540
It's your first day,
right?

2205
01:45:31,550 --> 01:45:34,700
That's a rare.
That doesn't take place in music or

2206
01:45:34,701 --> 01:45:39,701
anywhere else where you get an open mic
night and there's 30 people doing three

2207
01:45:39,741 --> 01:45:44,450
minutes and anybody can be one of them.
It's weird.

2208
01:45:44,451 --> 01:45:46,490
It's soulless people.
Yeah.

2209
01:45:46,491 --> 01:45:49,730
A lot of homeless people.
A lot of sketchy fucking weirdos to

2210
01:45:49,731 --> 01:45:52,630
touch the same mic.
As you know,

2211
01:45:53,990 --> 01:45:58,100
mike doesn't change.
Nobody cleans that comedy store.

2212
01:45:58,120 --> 01:45:59,420
Mike,
you got an intense.

2213
01:46:01,430 --> 01:46:05,270
No one's taking a clorox wipe.
The fuck is clean in anything at that

2214
01:46:05,271 --> 01:46:07,730
place.
They barely cleaned the tables.

2215
01:46:08,020 --> 01:46:11,180
The place they just deliver drinks and
keep the party rolling.

2216
01:46:11,360 --> 01:46:15,700
That's part of why it's so good.
It's grimy gutter

2217
01:46:17,680 --> 01:46:20,690
layer of humor.
That's covered everything for sure.

2218
01:46:21,310 --> 01:46:26,270
I think when they changed out the improv
and they swapped that lab for that back

2219
01:46:26,271 --> 01:46:28,880
bar and they.
They put that bar in there and just like

2220
01:46:29,200 --> 01:46:31,400
it seemed like they like removed a body
part.

2221
01:46:31,790 --> 01:46:32,950
It's like,
yeah,

2222
01:46:33,080 --> 01:46:34,430
I got it now.
Yeah,

2223
01:46:34,670 --> 01:46:37,610
but I mean in the way that like got this
energy went away.

2224
01:46:37,670 --> 01:46:40,820
Yeah.
It was just kind of a kind of miami

2225
01:46:40,850 --> 01:46:44,720
infusion.
So I feel like a night club in encino

2226
01:46:44,721 --> 01:46:46,730
restaurant bar.
That's what it was like.

2227
01:46:46,980 --> 01:46:50,010
Yeah,
just with the sofas

2228
01:46:50,010 --> 01:46:51,410
and they're just like,
oh,

2229
01:46:51,930 --> 01:46:52,621
like,
you know what,

2230
01:46:52,621 --> 01:46:54,150
this uh,
this room needs a place for people to

2231
01:46:54,151 --> 01:46:54,900
lounge more.

2232
01:46:54,900 --> 01:46:56,290
Yeah.
It just,

2233
01:46:56,340 --> 01:46:58,430
well it's kinda,
they kinda figured it out now they've

2234
01:46:58,431 --> 01:47:01,260
got the little shows that they do there.
It's kind of interesting,

2235
01:47:01,530 --> 01:47:03,840
but it used to be cool.
Used to be like a room,

2236
01:47:03,870 --> 01:47:07,590
like a separate room that was just
comedy in arusha fears.

2237
01:47:07,770 --> 01:47:10,650
Whole storytellers show started out
there.

2238
01:47:10,680 --> 01:47:13,050
That's where he would do it.
He would run it there because it was

2239
01:47:13,051 --> 01:47:14,550
like a 70,
80 seat room.

2240
01:47:15,040 --> 01:47:19,750
When you're talking about the lab,
the lab was the bar.

2241
01:47:20,020 --> 01:47:24,040
It was the lab because they redid it.
It allowed you to add a couple of times.

2242
01:47:24,070 --> 01:47:26,080
I was talking about the mate,
the mate,

2243
01:47:26,670 --> 01:47:28,570
the redoing of the memory.
We have the lab,

2244
01:47:28,900 --> 01:47:31,000
the lab room.
Yeah,

2245
01:47:31,001 --> 01:47:34,420
I remember that.
But that could have a really good energy

2246
01:47:34,421 --> 01:47:36,940
when,
when it had like that really pink

2247
01:47:36,941 --> 01:47:38,800
curtains,
those factor.

2248
01:47:38,830 --> 01:47:39,760
Yeah,
I remember.

2249
01:47:40,870 --> 01:47:41,560
I feel like.
Yeah,

2250
01:47:41,560 --> 01:47:46,560
I remember doing like a montreal
showcase showcase that that was like my

2251
01:47:47,380 --> 01:47:48,260
first and only.
No,

2252
01:47:48,340 --> 01:47:52,180
I did it twice a year later that week.
Yeah.

2253
01:47:53,170 --> 01:47:56,590
The improv is a weird spot that,
that hallway when you wait and go on,

2254
01:47:56,620 --> 01:48:00,220
there's nowhere to hide.
You stuck in the hallway.

2255
01:48:00,221 --> 01:48:02,260
People walking by and they're like,
hey man,

2256
01:48:02,261 --> 01:48:03,190
let me talk to you about something.
Like,

2257
01:48:03,220 --> 01:48:04,840
I'm going on stage right now.
I got to go,

2258
01:48:04,870 --> 01:48:05,890
hold on,
let me get a selfie.

2259
01:48:06,130 --> 01:48:11,130
Like did they could touch you like right
before going on stage again.

2260
01:48:11,210 --> 01:48:13,360
You know,
that never happens with Gary Clark.

2261
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:15,980
He's never about to go onstage and some
dude in the hallway with.

2262
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:16,421
No,
karen,

2263
01:48:16,421 --> 01:48:17,260
let me get to stop.
Yeah,

2264
01:48:17,270 --> 01:48:20,900
yeah.
You woke up and stuff.

2265
01:48:21,320 --> 01:48:23,350
But that's part of the reason why it's
interesting.

2266
01:48:23,351 --> 01:48:25,480
It's part of the reason because one of
them,

2267
01:48:26,020 --> 01:48:29,470
but it's also part of the reason why
it's so fucking weird art forum.

2268
01:48:29,680 --> 01:48:30,311
Yeah.
No,

2269
01:48:30,311 --> 01:48:31,480
it is.
It is.

2270
01:48:31,481 --> 01:48:32,830
It's a weird.
That is best.

2271
01:48:32,831 --> 01:48:37,600
It's so interesting in like you get a
lot of perspective and thoughts,

2272
01:48:37,620 --> 01:48:42,610
so you're doing a lot of sets these days
wouldn't gone up really haven't gone.

2273
01:48:42,850 --> 01:48:47,850
I've done maybe two or three sets in the
past year and a half maybe.

2274
01:48:50,500 --> 01:48:55,210
Maybe the last time I was like,
why did you do like two minutes and walk

2275
01:48:55,211 --> 01:48:56,044
off?

2276
01:48:59,820 --> 01:49:02,020
Why?
It's just

2277
01:49:02,020 --> 01:49:05,500
not when it's not.
We're ideas are going now.

2278
01:49:05,620 --> 01:49:10,620
Where's your ideas going now?
Felt like it's a lot of film projects

2279
01:49:10,871 --> 01:49:13,350
and like some television stuff just
feels more normal to you.

2280
01:49:13,370 --> 01:49:15,850
Yeah,
it just feels like the way of.

2281
01:49:15,970 --> 01:49:17,110
I mean even,
you know,

2282
01:49:17,680 --> 01:49:21,280
uh,
before I had like a tv show I would do a

2283
01:49:21,281 --> 01:49:24,160
lot of thoughts would just go there and
I wouldn't do stand up a lot during that

2284
01:49:24,161 --> 01:49:25,510
and like,
you know,

2285
01:49:26,320 --> 01:49:31,320
I like to just focus in like put the
energy where you feel the most creative.

2286
01:49:31,451 --> 01:49:34,210
And so that's why,
I mean I could go up and you could,

2287
01:49:34,650 --> 01:49:37,780
I don't know,
something about stand up right now,

2288
01:49:38,050 --> 01:49:39,970
you know,
it's it simultaneously.

2289
01:49:39,971 --> 01:49:40,721
Like,
oh man,

2290
01:49:40,721 --> 01:49:45,010
there's some really amazing things
happening and just kind of as a whole is

2291
01:49:45,011 --> 01:49:48,370
just like a certain.
I think it's going through like this

2292
01:49:48,371 --> 01:49:50,890
growing phase,
like this kind of identity thing,

2293
01:49:50,891 --> 01:49:51,130
right?

2294
01:49:51,130 --> 01:49:55,270
Because it's like
I feel like there needs to be kind of

2295
01:49:55,271 --> 01:50:00,271
this overhaul and even one in its
presentation and to what the expectation

2296
01:50:01,001 --> 01:50:03,970
of performer audience thing because
there's a lot of like,

2297
01:50:04,620 --> 01:50:08,110
oh no,
I'll go and I'll see a lot of trump

2298
01:50:08,111 --> 01:50:10,990
stuff and a lot of things,
but it's not like new perspective.

2299
01:50:10,991 --> 01:50:12,520
And it's like,
you know,

2300
01:50:12,550 --> 01:50:17,340
it's a lot of civil rights leaders and a
lot of things and,

2301
01:50:17,620 --> 01:50:19,600
and you know,
and not even good.

2302
01:50:19,601 --> 01:50:24,010
So rising leaders just talking points
and just kind of preaching,

2303
01:50:24,590 --> 01:50:26,320
preaching the choir is.
And it's like,

2304
01:50:26,530 --> 01:50:29,410
you know,
the whole thing is this unique

2305
01:50:29,411 --> 01:50:33,000
articulation in this unique thing that
you're supposed to be bringing it.

2306
01:50:33,001 --> 01:50:34,660
It's show and tell.
Like it is like,

2307
01:50:34,780 --> 01:50:35,770
hey,
I have this thing.

2308
01:50:35,771 --> 01:50:37,720
I have this thought that I think is
unique.

2309
01:50:37,721 --> 01:50:41,470
I have this way of presenting this
thought that I think is unique and every

2310
01:50:41,480 --> 01:50:43,750
now and again it's profitable right now.

2311
01:50:43,750 --> 01:50:45,790
This is the bubble where it is right
now,

2312
01:50:45,791 --> 01:50:47,200
right?
If you go up and you

2313
01:50:50,170 --> 01:50:53,380
speak for your group,
for you speak in this type of way,

2314
01:50:53,381 --> 01:50:56,730
you can get rewarded for it and kind of
these immediate rewards are understand

2315
01:50:56,731 --> 01:50:57,460
it,
but it,

2316
01:50:57,460 --> 01:51:00,220
it really does kind of choke the art
form.

2317
01:51:00,221 --> 01:51:01,840
IT chokes.
What's interesting about it,

2318
01:51:02,230 --> 01:51:03,670
you know,
there's just so many people trying to

2319
01:51:03,671 --> 01:51:07,030
stand out and it's so difficult to do
that and they find these paths and one

2320
01:51:07,031 --> 01:51:11,390
of those paths is to be someone who's
like really moral and righteous and has

2321
01:51:11,410 --> 01:51:13,340
something to say,
but it's also under the.

2322
01:51:13,380 --> 01:51:18,380
It's under the illusion of being
rebellious in an edgy.

2323
01:51:19,390 --> 01:51:21,820
It's under.
It's under the illusion of these things

2324
01:51:21,821 --> 01:51:24,560
because it's like a.
You know,

2325
01:51:24,561 --> 01:51:27,260
there was,
when dick gregory said the things that

2326
01:51:27,261 --> 01:51:32,020
he said and the things we said there was
real danger in a conservative country.

2327
01:51:32,200 --> 01:51:35,380
There's real danger to a lot of things.
They says you get onstage and you're

2328
01:51:35,381 --> 01:51:38,590
like,
fuck trump in los angeles and New York

2329
01:51:38,591 --> 01:51:41,710
city honing his skills and it's just
like,

2330
01:51:41,720 --> 01:51:43,180
oh well,
good for you.

2331
01:51:43,210 --> 01:51:47,170
That unique perspective you bring about
how this is the worst of times.

2332
01:51:47,930 --> 01:51:49,170
Yeah,
it's a,

2333
01:51:49,270 --> 01:51:51,460
there's definitely a lot of that.
There's a lot of voices,

2334
01:51:51,850 --> 01:51:53,410
you know,
but there's a lot of great stuff to

2335
01:51:53,500 --> 01:51:54,400
know.
There is,

2336
01:51:54,580 --> 01:51:56,610
there are unique,
You know,

2337
01:51:56,740 --> 01:51:58,180
expect like that.
That's the thing.

2338
01:51:58,181 --> 01:52:00,280
It's just anything.
It's flooded right now.

2339
01:52:01,330 --> 01:52:04,030
Do you plan on going Back,
do you have aspirations or do you have a

2340
01:52:04,031 --> 01:52:05,650
thought in your head or do you just go
with the flow?

2341
01:52:05,710 --> 01:52:07,870
It's kind of go with.
I mean if I,

2342
01:52:08,620 --> 01:52:13,620
if I feel and I like thoughts come out
that fit or if I find a way to do it,

2343
01:52:14,860 --> 01:52:19,060
like a thing that maybe doesn't
necessarily fit in with that,

2344
01:52:19,061 --> 01:52:19,930
then maybe I'll do that.

2345
01:52:20,090 --> 01:52:22,210
I'm open to it.
I juSt don't know.

2346
01:52:23,380 --> 01:52:25,210
Yeah,
I don't really know what that is right

2347
01:52:25,211 --> 01:52:26,660
now.
That's beautiful though.

2348
01:52:26,710 --> 01:52:28,420
You have that sensibility.
Then you can just.

2349
01:52:28,930 --> 01:52:32,490
This is what I'm thinking about this.
What I'd like to do right now focused,

2350
01:52:32,810 --> 01:52:36,910
I've been in more music studios in the
past two years and have been comedy

2351
01:52:36,911 --> 01:52:37,750
clubs.
Really?

2352
01:52:38,010 --> 01:52:39,910
Yeah.
What are you doing with music?

2353
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:42,220
Just kind of.
They're just like,

2354
01:52:42,850 --> 01:52:43,710
just hanging out.
Well,

2355
01:52:43,770 --> 01:52:47,080
just I like,
I mean I like to talk about it and you

2356
01:52:47,220 --> 01:52:48,890
kind of discuss it in the,
you know,

2357
01:52:49,660 --> 01:52:51,440
I've,
I've been lucky enough to kind of be

2358
01:52:51,441 --> 01:52:56,120
around some artists that I admired and
just listened to that creation.

2359
01:52:56,260 --> 01:52:59,000
Like I like the immediacy of that
process,

2360
01:52:59,001 --> 01:53:00,770
like a lot I liked it is what I was
saying.

2361
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:03,560
What I like about even here it's like
it's,

2362
01:53:03,600 --> 01:53:07,720
it's an art space that you have here
where you can kind of create like in

2363
01:53:07,730 --> 01:53:11,150
this immediate space and exactly how you
see it.

2364
01:53:11,160 --> 01:53:13,370
It comes out in that way and you can
record it,

2365
01:53:13,460 --> 01:53:17,180
capture like that.
And when your mind is in that space,

2366
01:53:17,210 --> 01:53:20,360
you know,
you need to only do things that it can

2367
01:53:20,361 --> 01:53:21,194
be good at.

2368
01:53:21,390 --> 01:53:23,430
Yeah.
Yeah.

2369
01:53:23,490 --> 01:53:26,370
So it's a,
it's a good year.

2370
01:53:26,970 --> 01:53:30,840
It seems to me as an outsider is that
you found like your natural path,

2371
01:53:30,900 --> 01:53:32,960
you found a natural path like you've,
you've,

2372
01:53:33,020 --> 01:53:35,310
you've made it in,
you become successful,

2373
01:53:35,640 --> 01:53:38,070
you've,
you're well known now and you've got

2374
01:53:38,071 --> 01:53:40,050
freedom and you're just like,
let me just find my,

2375
01:53:40,080 --> 01:53:40,913
what am I into?

2376
01:53:41,090 --> 01:53:42,390
Well,
I'm doiNg what I hope

2377
01:53:43,910 --> 01:53:48,910
like all of us are trying to do.
Like the oNe thing that I've always done

2378
01:53:50,120 --> 01:53:54,820
is exactly what I want to do in the car
and,

2379
01:53:54,830 --> 01:53:57,170
and it's not just by nature,
it's not like,

2380
01:53:57,200 --> 01:53:59,810
you know.
And then I told her it's just by saying

2381
01:54:00,350 --> 01:54:03,620
not doing the things.
If it doesn't match then not doing it,

2382
01:54:03,980 --> 01:54:04,761
you know,
like,

2383
01:54:04,761 --> 01:54:09,740
and trying to have a vision of what the
thing is and just making that right.

2384
01:54:09,741 --> 01:54:13,340
And so like that's what like comedy at a
special.

2385
01:54:13,350 --> 01:54:16,100
Again,
the medium finds you,

2386
01:54:16,520 --> 01:54:19,010
it comes to you,
you don't go to the medium,

2387
01:54:20,410 --> 01:54:24,590
the medium is meeting you.
Like so many people are just like

2388
01:54:24,591 --> 01:54:27,890
conforming and just becomes the same
thing.

2389
01:54:27,920 --> 01:54:28,970
I don't know.
It's weird time.

2390
01:54:29,110 --> 01:54:30,850
Well that's a good outsider's
perspective.

2391
01:54:30,851 --> 01:54:32,230
Like you,
you're an inside of that.

2392
01:54:32,231 --> 01:54:35,230
It has almost an outsider's perspective
because you're looking at it like you

2393
01:54:35,231 --> 01:54:39,370
step back a little bit and watch all the
fucking hamster wheel,

2394
01:54:39,710 --> 01:54:43,330
watch all the scrambling
around this.

2395
01:54:43,331 --> 01:54:46,410
A lot of that men and there's a lot of
fake horse shit going on.

2396
01:54:46,411 --> 01:54:50,590
It's a lot of people grabbing at straws.
It's really noisy.

2397
01:54:50,630 --> 01:54:53,180
Yeah,
but so many opportunities.

2398
01:54:53,181 --> 01:54:56,980
There's so many venues and so many
comedians and it's also comedy so hot

2399
01:54:56,981 --> 01:54:58,240
right now.
It's like,

2400
01:54:58,241 --> 01:55:01,960
it's such an exciting time for standup
that there's so many people doing it,

2401
01:55:02,020 --> 01:55:06,040
so you're automatically going to get.
Just like when you try and out jokes,

2402
01:55:06,070 --> 01:55:07,550
a lot of them suck.
Well,

2403
01:55:07,560 --> 01:55:10,510
when you trying out comedians.
Oh yeah.

2404
01:55:10,511 --> 01:55:13,360
I'm
gonna make.

2405
01:55:13,510 --> 01:55:18,310
I mean this might be in terms of like
success to failure ratios,

2406
01:55:18,311 --> 01:55:22,300
one of the most brutal art forums you
could ever attempt to be a professional.

2407
01:55:22,490 --> 01:55:23,840
Yeah.
Yeah.

2408
01:55:23,900 --> 01:55:24,740
No,
definitely.

2409
01:55:24,890 --> 01:55:25,671
It's,
I mean,

2410
01:55:25,671 --> 01:55:29,540
because you go,
you're going out there kind of make it

2411
01:55:29,570 --> 01:55:30,650
with the thought in.

2412
01:55:31,410 --> 01:55:34,320
How many guys from your era,
like when you sTarted doing open mic

2413
01:55:34,321 --> 01:55:36,810
nights are doing well now?

2414
01:55:37,560 --> 01:55:41,130
Um,
guys or guys.

2415
01:55:41,131 --> 01:55:42,330
Uh,
uh,

2416
01:55:42,810 --> 01:55:47,810
right.
Really finding their kind of space and

2417
01:55:48,151 --> 01:55:51,660
guys just starting to get tv shows and
they're starting to get like guys that I

2418
01:55:51,661 --> 01:55:55,770
remember seeing it like mike,
so really starting to to do it.

2419
01:55:55,771 --> 01:55:58,140
It's in the past couple of years is
really kind of hit.

2420
01:55:58,320 --> 01:56:03,320
I was on this weird kind of weird path
trajectory type of thing.

2421
01:56:04,411 --> 01:56:09,411
I,
I kind of was just on the side of it.

2422
01:56:09,601 --> 01:56:12,780
I feel I feel like in this weird sense
and things kind of happened and I kind

2423
01:56:12,781 --> 01:56:16,110
of found an infrastructure that worked
for me really quickly.

2424
01:56:16,590 --> 01:56:18,990
You know what I mean?
But like announce around now is the

2425
01:56:18,991 --> 01:56:21,000
time.
I think that a lot of things starting to

2426
01:56:21,001 --> 01:56:26,001
happen for guys that have been around.
If you were around 500 dudeS when you

2427
01:56:27,151 --> 01:56:31,650
first started that you knew regularly.
Maybe three are working now.

2428
01:56:31,670 --> 01:56:33,240
Yeah.
Yeah.

2429
01:56:33,990 --> 01:56:35,220
Right.
Yeah.

2430
01:56:35,280 --> 01:56:37,650
Legitimately,
like if you counted all the mop over the

2431
01:56:37,651 --> 01:56:39,120
first 10 years,
you stand up career,

2432
01:56:39,570 --> 01:56:43,880
you've got maybe three that are doing
that are doing what they want to do.

2433
01:56:45,300 --> 01:56:46,350
They're doing what they want to do.

2434
01:56:50,400 --> 01:56:51,870
maybe.
It really is that.

2435
01:56:51,880 --> 01:56:52,920
Yeah,
it's fucking brutal.

2436
01:56:52,921 --> 01:56:57,240
A lot of comedians operate in this space
where it's like they don't know they

2437
01:56:57,241 --> 01:57:00,510
could do what they want to do.
That's a big wall,

2438
01:57:01,410 --> 01:57:03,420
a big wall.
I've seen a lot of people stop at that

2439
01:57:03,421 --> 01:57:07,470
while people that can,
that are just like still trying to

2440
01:57:07,471 --> 01:57:10,710
figure out how to write the confidence
to act,

2441
01:57:11,160 --> 01:57:13,090
the confidence to act on your actual
instincts,

2442
01:57:13,180 --> 01:57:17,340
to do what you really want to do,
which is so crazy because comedy,

2443
01:57:17,350 --> 01:57:20,820
you think that we'd be the ones that are
closest to it because it's so

2444
01:57:20,821 --> 01:57:23,970
instinctual and in such a reaction,
you know,

2445
01:57:23,971 --> 01:57:25,670
like a lot of things that you do have
such a real.

2446
01:57:25,700 --> 01:57:30,510
Like when you discover your funny
through like when you discover you can

2447
01:57:30,511 --> 01:57:32,920
sing by preparing to sink,
you know,

2448
01:57:32,940 --> 01:57:36,840
you go and you prepare the singing voice
and you give it a shot and then you

2449
01:57:36,841 --> 01:57:38,700
discover you're funny by just like,
oh,

2450
01:57:38,790 --> 01:57:39,623
what?

2451
01:57:40,290 --> 01:57:40,711
Right.
Right,

2452
01:57:40,711 --> 01:57:41,151
right.
Yeah.

2453
01:57:41,151 --> 01:57:43,560
Like you just got you a photo finish
chicken,

2454
01:57:43,710 --> 01:57:45,200
you know,
it's funny.

2455
01:57:45,310 --> 01:57:46,081
It was that.
Okay.

2456
01:57:46,081 --> 01:57:50,790
Or by like a hunch that you have so like
it's so instinctual that you would think

2457
01:57:51,180 --> 01:57:54,000
it would be more of that.
Like following your instincts,

2458
01:57:54,001 --> 01:57:56,490
following your gut,
forging your own path.

2459
01:57:56,491 --> 01:57:58,170
Also,
it's so scary in the beginning that once

2460
01:57:58,171 --> 01:58:00,810
you find shelter,
you hold onto that.

2461
01:58:00,880 --> 01:58:02,610
That's why those,
you know,

2462
01:58:02,611 --> 01:58:05,940
the saddest comedians,
the ones that they do stand up for five

2463
01:58:05,941 --> 01:58:07,830
years,
he developed a half an hour and it never

2464
01:58:07,831 --> 01:58:08,790
changes.
Yeah.

2465
01:58:09,050 --> 01:58:12,150
Found it claimed to that bitch like a
fucking life raft.

2466
01:58:12,790 --> 01:58:14,190
Yeah.
People listen man.

2467
01:58:14,220 --> 01:58:17,760
You know,
people don't talk about how comfy glass

2468
01:58:17,761 --> 01:58:18,610
ceilings,
you know,

2469
01:58:18,630 --> 01:58:23,630
they're really surprisingly soft.
Yeah.

2470
01:58:24,330 --> 01:58:25,920
Well listen,
I gotta get the fuck out of here.

2471
01:58:25,960 --> 01:58:27,570
Yeah,
this is great.

2472
01:58:27,620 --> 01:58:30,090
What do you got going on?
You promote anything you got?

2473
01:58:30,091 --> 01:58:31,550
Anything happens.
Oh.

2474
01:58:31,940 --> 01:58:34,170
Oh,
I got to talk about drew's special.

2475
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:36,570
Uh,
I meant to send that to you.

2476
01:58:37,070 --> 01:58:40,380
I'll send it to me now.
I'll send it comes out this weekend.

2477
01:58:40,540 --> 01:58:42,040
It comes out a saturday.

2478
01:58:42,140 --> 01:58:44,230
It's really fun.
It's a comedian I love.

2479
01:58:44,860 --> 01:58:47,200
Um,
I'm excited for people to see him

2480
01:58:47,590 --> 01:58:50,230
directly to special data without an
audience.

2481
01:58:50,680 --> 01:58:52,060
Without an audience.
Yeah,

2482
01:58:52,920 --> 01:58:57,400
what do you do it?
We shot it on a stage just like sage who

2483
01:58:57,401 --> 01:59:00,130
kind of created the environment and uh,
yeah,

2484
01:59:00,170 --> 01:59:01,010
I,
I,

2485
01:59:03,310 --> 01:59:04,200
I,
I,

2486
01:59:04,210 --> 01:59:09,210
I,
I think the thoughts work removed from

2487
01:59:09,441 --> 01:59:13,190
it and I'm really excited to really
excited to capture like that.

2488
01:59:13,520 --> 01:59:14,241
Wow.
Yeah.

2489
01:59:14,241 --> 01:59:15,950
I don't even really know what you call
this thing,

2490
01:59:15,970 --> 01:59:17,510
but I'm,
I'm,

2491
01:59:17,590 --> 01:59:21,020
I'm really.
Because it was like when I first saw

2492
01:59:21,021 --> 01:59:22,460
him,
I,

2493
01:59:22,461 --> 01:59:23,900
uh,
is this trailer?

2494
01:59:23,930 --> 01:59:28,390
Yeah,
someone's got to get

2495
01:59:29,960 --> 01:59:31,750
real wild.
Like the thoughts.

2496
01:59:32,080 --> 01:59:32,913
Yeah.

2497
01:59:43,430 --> 01:59:46,430
I don't want to date someone I love.
I love my mom.

2498
01:59:46,880 --> 01:59:49,130
She's single soon.
Not that it matters when people are

2499
01:59:49,131 --> 01:59:49,871
like,
what?

2500
01:59:49,871 --> 01:59:50,710
And you're like,
oh,

2501
02:00:02,160 --> 02:00:05,910
August 25th.
That's interesting.

2502
02:00:05,911 --> 02:00:09,510
You know those shows,
those sitcoms that they,

2503
02:00:09,511 --> 02:00:12,970
when they first started doing single
camera sitcoms and they started doing

2504
02:00:12,971 --> 02:00:14,070
them without an audience.
People Are like,

2505
02:00:14,071 --> 02:00:14,840
what?
Yeah,

2506
02:00:14,840 --> 02:00:16,660
what the Larry Sanders show.
One of those,

2507
02:00:16,770 --> 02:00:18,120
like,
what the fuck is this?

2508
02:00:18,420 --> 02:00:20,190
There's no audience.
How weird.

2509
02:00:20,370 --> 02:00:22,350
Still funny though.
And people laugh at home.

2510
02:00:22,410 --> 02:00:23,161
Yeah.
You know,

2511
02:00:23,161 --> 02:00:25,110
some of my favorite shows he ever
watched,

2512
02:00:25,111 --> 02:00:28,170
the unbreakable kimmy schmidt.
I haven't really watched it,

2513
02:00:28,171 --> 02:00:31,290
but it's just fucking hilarious show,
but that's the audience.

2514
02:00:31,291 --> 02:00:33,060
That's the thing.
The thing is that it's like,

2515
02:00:33,140 --> 02:00:34,960
I think the thoughts,
you know,

2516
02:00:35,150 --> 02:00:36,600
stand alone.
They speak for itself.

2517
02:00:36,630 --> 02:00:37,650
It was like,
why not?

2518
02:00:37,790 --> 02:00:40,830
Yeah.
It's really exciting to just kind of put

2519
02:00:40,831 --> 02:00:44,430
that into beautiful living rooms.
