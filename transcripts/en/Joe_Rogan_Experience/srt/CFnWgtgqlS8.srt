1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,070
The Joe Rogan experience,
either way,

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:02,860
the,
the,

3
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:05,400
the,
the important thing is that like seeing

4
00:00:05,401 --> 00:00:07,530
those,
those images on those shows where

5
00:00:07,531 --> 00:00:08,940
they're repeating over and over and over
again.

6
00:00:08,941 --> 00:00:12,510
They have all these graphic images of
bodies and pulling things out of bodies

7
00:00:12,511 --> 00:00:14,630
and it's like,
it's pretty intense that you're,

8
00:00:14,631 --> 00:00:16,590
you're taking that stuff into your
psyche.

9
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:19,740
You're taking that stuff into your,
your bank of experiences.

10
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,970
I don't like sexual stuff on television
early.

11
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,240
He believed that.
You mean like girls making out or like

12
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,170
let's say I'm watching Diane Sawyer and
have like a condom commercial.

13
00:00:28,171 --> 00:00:30,780
I'll lose my mind.
A condom commercial will bother you.

14
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:33,150
Oh,
because little kids really destroyed

15
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,310
tampon.
Commercial.

16
00:00:35,311 --> 00:00:37,290
I want to choke myself and my wife was
in the room.

17
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,520
Are like your rants in the room with
some older woman since I was a kid.

18
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,910
KOTEX commercial.
I would sit down and look straight

19
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:45,640
ahead.

20
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,680
I never get so embarrassed in my life.
I don't want them to ask me if I know

21
00:00:49,681 --> 00:00:52,630
and I don't want to fucking know the
blood comes out of this match

22
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:58,290
what you put up there.
That's got to do it.

23
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:00,450
But I'm just that don't even bring it
up.

24
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,160
You know,
there's some women that cute.

25
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:03,691
They think it's cute.
Like,

26
00:01:03,691 --> 00:01:04,290
hold on,
I gotta go.

27
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:05,370
We gotta Tampon.
Listen,

28
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:07,410
I don't want to know.
I want to love you.

29
00:01:07,411 --> 00:01:09,030
Bleed.
You just ruined everything for me.

30
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:10,530
I guess.
I don't want to know.

31
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:12,840
That's not really bothers me.
That bothers me.

32
00:01:12,841 --> 00:01:14,280
The sight of blood.
No,

33
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:14,520
no,
no,

34
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:14,700
no,
no,

35
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,280
no.
Decided talking about that.

36
00:01:17,281 --> 00:01:20,490
You fucking pussies bleeding around me.
That's what I fucking hate when even

37
00:01:20,491 --> 00:01:22,910
when they haven't been purse.
I get sick to my stomach.

38
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:27,480
I want to see a fucking tampon.
I don't want to fucking see a Tampon at

39
00:01:27,481 --> 00:01:28,010
all.

40
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:28,350
Alright.
Right.

41
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,900
When I'm watching TV and a tampon
commercial comes up.

42
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,630
Even when I'm by myself.
I feel creepy.

43
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,530
That's so weird.
Condom commercials.

44
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:40,440
That new commercial with a chicken head
popping out on the fucking thing with

45
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,430
you.
Put on your finger.

46
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,590
Have you seen that fucking commercial
chick with the creepy finger?

47
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,110
You to relieve stress.
You know what meant?

48
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,700
I don't want to know about that shit.
Play to walk the fuck is that

49
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,310
Zombie?
Oh my God.

50
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:59,430
That is to put that away.
That's broken.

51
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:00,960
That one's broken.
That is just.

52
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,840
That means I didn't get that one fixed.
So this day,

53
00:02:03,841 --> 00:02:05,580
anything back,
a little sprays,

54
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:11,010
anything bad and television.
10 o'clock drives me up the fucking

55
00:02:11,011 --> 00:02:11,844
wall.

56
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:14,440
The reason I know this and I want to do
a shameless plug.

57
00:02:14,441 --> 00:02:16,420
My Buddy Ben Wallace has this great
book,

58
00:02:16,421 --> 00:02:20,200
the billionaire's vinegar,
and it's about the most expensive bottle

59
00:02:20,201 --> 00:02:22,510
of wine ever sold,
but like what is good wine?

60
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:25,330
Do we know good wine when we taste?
It's fascinating.

61
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,100
Well,
if you get really old shit,

62
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,750
most likely it's not good anymore.

63
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,700
Well the problem is,
as his book explains is the problem is

64
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,860
no one.
This is a bottle.

65
00:02:34,861 --> 00:02:37,650
The most expensive bottle of wine.
Every soul wound up being fraudulent,

66
00:02:37,651 --> 00:02:39,870
but it was purported to be owned by
Thomas Jefferson.

67
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,050
Okay.
So for like Steve Forbes zoned for

68
00:02:43,051 --> 00:02:44,980
awhile and all these different guys on
this bottle line,

69
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,650
one of the Koch brothers don't want it
for a while and in the end there's no

70
00:02:49,651 --> 00:02:53,430
one around who can go.
I've had a lot of wine from that year.

71
00:02:55,350 --> 00:03:00,040
Spray down the money.
Isn't crazy though that

72
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,400
these different rich guys had the wine
and sold it to each other,

73
00:03:03,401 --> 00:03:07,740
like they passed it on Forbes,
stored in a,

74
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:11,320
put it in a in their corporate
headquarters and they had an a box,

75
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:15,130
like a glass lift boxes of decoration,
but they hadn't standing upright with a

76
00:03:15,131 --> 00:03:20,131
heat lamp in there or dried that cork
out and the felt in the bottle.

77
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:24,190
So later when people were trying to
analyze what was in it,

78
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:29,700
there can never rule out the intrusion
of foreign substances which will not

79
00:03:29,891 --> 00:03:33,550
allow them to find out what it was.
The guy they eventually like is why the

80
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:38,610
guy who created the hoax would take
really good wine and do weird stuff to

81
00:03:39,911 --> 00:03:41,440
it.
Like you'd put a little bit of vanilla

82
00:03:41,441 --> 00:03:44,540
extract in here or he'd put some dirt
from his gutter in.

83
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:49,541
They're just weird things he could do to
kind of throw people and then guys that

84
00:03:49,691 --> 00:03:52,290
are like big swinging dicks about wine,
we're tasting.

85
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:53,210
They'd be like,
Oh yeah,

86
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,570
I got it.
It's a brilliant book,

87
00:03:58,571 --> 00:03:58,950
man.

88
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,090
Okay.
Here's a serious question.

89
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:04,170
Is there a guy that has ever existed
that has a full suit of armor in his

90
00:04:04,171 --> 00:04:05,670
house that isn't a douchebag?

91
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,470
Nope.
Well,

92
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,620
I mean,
comic book collector guys aren't really

93
00:04:10,621 --> 00:04:11,454
Douche bags,
you know,

94
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,940
they like that shit.
You know,

95
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:16,410
like they have like a real suit of armor
in their house.

96
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,630
I've almost bought at an armored helmet
the other day.

97
00:04:18,631 --> 00:04:20,820
I saw helmets.
Helmets are Kinda dope.

98
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:22,170
Yeah.
I almost bought one of those so I could

99
00:04:22,171 --> 00:04:24,530
see it.
I would say last case I would say,

100
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,060
uh,
the same can be said about those dime

101
00:04:27,061 --> 00:04:30,450
store Indians.
The cigar store Indian

102
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,020
or the black jockeys that you put on
your lawn.

103
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:35,520
Oh,
that's rude.

104
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:40,220
How about people who have like little
gremlins and shit on there?

105
00:04:40,221 --> 00:04:43,870
The elves are those,
what are they?

106
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,420
Yeah,
my step Mama House east on her front

107
00:04:46,421 --> 00:04:47,710
porch today.
If it starts to rain,

108
00:04:47,711 --> 00:04:50,730
she puts her raincoat on it and then if
it's like halloween she dresses up in a

109
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,830
little costume.
Was like this big ceramic geese.

110
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,130
And then I,
I was,

111
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:57,420
I always make fun of it.
And then somebody came,

112
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,770
broke it recently and she was so sad
about it.

113
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:02,980
So now she has all these stupid geese
outfits and she can't find another one

114
00:05:02,981 --> 00:05:05,520
of them.
So are you kidding me?

115
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:11,160
Ceramic.

116
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,830
Geez.
What happened today?

117
00:05:13,831 --> 00:05:18,831
It was the worst day of my life.
Someone cracked my ceramic birds.

118
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:24,180
I had that one that I leave.
It makes me so happy.

119
00:05:24,181 --> 00:05:28,170
I come home,
I see my ceramic duck.

120
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:32,250
I got him into Toronto World Fairy Sixty
two.

121
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:36,050
It's x and they don't make them that
much anymore.

122
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,240
He's beauty.

123
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:41,270
He defined my yard.

124
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,850
I swear you to look at me.

125
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:47,630
He was my friend.
I know that sounds retarded.

126
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,460
I don't care.
He was my friend.

127
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:54,540
Ever since he left.
Ever since Jimmy left,

128
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,710
he's gone.

129
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,890
Ever since gone.
A

130
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:01,700
house is haunted.
Gone.

131
00:06:01,701 --> 00:06:04,910
I feel a little crazy.
I can't sleep at night because I feel

132
00:06:04,911 --> 00:06:07,610
like I failed him and he's going to kill
me in my sleep.

133
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,990
I should've.
I should've gotten them a coat of armor.

134
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:17,200
It was my little chally.
I had a name for room charlie the duck

135
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:23,060
and now he's dead.
I had illustrated books I made about him

136
00:06:23,061 --> 00:06:26,630
over the years.
He's gonna come back and kill those

137
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:29,200
punks that broke them.
That's fucking Rad.

138
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:32,780
Isn't a Stephen King movie about a
fucking evil ceramic duck.

139
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,580
Some kids break.
It goes out and cuts their throat and

140
00:06:36,581 --> 00:06:39,080
their sleep.
Just imagine that you're waking up in a

141
00:06:39,081 --> 00:06:41,540
giant ceramic Daca just trying to throw
it out.

142
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,470
Oh,
I can.

143
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:46,400
I'm never going to get tired of seeing
the neighborhood punks get beat up for

144
00:06:46,401 --> 00:06:49,100
doing something wrong somehow.
You love that story

145
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,320
recording.
Oh,

146
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,330
it is already.
What the fuck son?
