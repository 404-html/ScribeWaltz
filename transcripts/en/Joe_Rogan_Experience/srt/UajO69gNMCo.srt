00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,460
Hello Freak bitches and,

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,440
and I don't,

3
00:00:04,441 --> 00:00:05,221
and you're talking to a guy.

4
00:00:05,221 --> 00:00:06,270
I don't like Hillary at all.

5
00:00:06,271 --> 00:00:07,104
I think she's,

6
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:08,520
I think she's more of the same.

7
00:00:08,521 --> 00:00:08,881
Yes.

8
00:00:08,881 --> 00:00:10,410
But I think she's a corrupt human being.

9
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,700
There are a lot of examples of that.

10
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:12,750
Um,

11
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:13,261
however,

12
00:00:13,261 --> 00:00:15,810
I'm not as uncharitable
to say that I think she's,

13
00:00:15,811 --> 00:00:16,890
I don't think she's evil.

14
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:18,390
I think she has a vision for the world.

15
00:00:18,391 --> 00:00:19,201
I think she wished she,

16
00:00:19,201 --> 00:00:19,771
in her mind,

17
00:00:19,771 --> 00:00:22,170
she believes she knows
what's best for the country.

18
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,860
But there's a difference because I think
she's willing to take big shortcuts to

19
00:00:25,861 --> 00:00:29,480
gain influence and always has an
a career and a short colleague.

20
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:30,050
What?

21
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:30,261
Like,

22
00:00:30,261 --> 00:00:34,380
we can have big influence using political
influence to get what she wants when,

23
00:00:34,381 --> 00:00:34,830
when,

24
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:35,101
I mean,

25
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:38,280
if you look at the people
that Clinton pardoned,

26
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:38,851
I mean,

27
00:00:38,851 --> 00:00:41,430
that part in scandal was the
craziest thing in the world.

28
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:41,641
Did he?

29
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:42,210
Pardon?

30
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:42,661
Frank?

31
00:00:42,661 --> 00:00:43,170
Rich.

32
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:44,190
We'll take a look at the list.

33
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,001
Frank.

34
00:00:45,001 --> 00:00:45,360
Rich,

35
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:45,750
uh,

36
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:46,161
the,

37
00:00:46,161 --> 00:00:51,161
the Hee Hee Hillary wanted to run for
Senate in New York and he needed certain

38
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,510
counties and he needed a large,

39
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:55,051
I believe,

40
00:00:55,051 --> 00:00:56,940
Hasidic Jewish vote vote.

41
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:02,390
And he pardoned some guy in a rabbi or
somebody in there that it was such a

42
00:01:02,671 --> 00:01:03,070
blur.

43
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:03,640
It's a little,

44
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,490
I remember the democratic somewhat,

45
00:01:05,491 --> 00:01:07,620
I think it was one of the
democratic pundents who said,

46
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,750
I don't know how you defend this.

47
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:14,520
It's just so obvious that he's trying to
buy his wife votes that he's trying to

48
00:01:14,521 --> 00:01:15,181
buy influence.

49
00:01:15,181 --> 00:01:15,930
And that was,

50
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,220
that's well documented.

51
00:01:17,221 --> 00:01:19,200
I don't think a lot of Democrats
would disagree with that.

52
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:19,771
You know,

53
00:01:19,771 --> 00:01:20,460
look it up.

54
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,840
Look up the uranium one.

55
00:01:21,841 --> 00:01:23,640
Deal one deal.

56
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,800
Who through Bill Clinton's influence,

57
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,830
this Canadian businessman
bought the Kazakh oil,

58
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,510
a uranium fields.

59
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:30,710
Well,

60
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:32,250
let's go one scandal at a time.

61
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:33,243
The first one,

62
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:34,620
did you find the first one?

63
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:35,890
Yeah.

64
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:36,581
Is that the guy's name?

65
00:01:36,581 --> 00:01:37,480
Mark Pardons.

66
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,540
But look at this guy up before,

67
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:40,620
I think he was going to go down.

68
00:01:40,621 --> 00:01:41,280
And it's like the,

69
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:41,851
at the time,

70
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:43,380
largest tax evasion.

71
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:43,561
Oh,

72
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:44,394
that's right.

73
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:45,390
Living in Switzerland,

74
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,130
prosecuting them.

75
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:47,963
Oh Wow.

76
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,290
Things right here in the middle.

77
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,153
Yeah.

78
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,113
Hmm.

79
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,673
Future.

80
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:56,940
He was a fugitive who had fled the US
doing this prosecution was residing in

81
00:01:56,941 --> 00:01:57,600
Switzerland.

82
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,620
He had $48 million in taxes and
it was charged with 51 cadences.

83
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:04,650
Accounts of taxpayers was
pardoned for tax evasion.

84
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:09,990
He was required to pay a $1 million fine
and waive any use of the pardon as a

85
00:02:09,991 --> 00:02:13,050
defense against any future civil charges
that were filed against him in the

86
00:02:13,051 --> 00:02:13,290
same,

87
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:14,130
in the same case.

88
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:14,760
Whoa.

89
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,100
Critics complain that Denise Eisenberg,

90
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:17,820
rich,

91
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:18,840
his former wife,

92
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:24,020
had made substantial donations to the
Clinton library and Mrs Clinton's Senate

93
00:02:25,381 --> 00:02:26,190
campaign.

94
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:28,590
What a surprise that Marc Rich,

95
00:02:28,591 --> 00:02:31,200
who lives in Switzerland and
you're going to give them a part,

96
00:02:31,201 --> 00:02:32,190
and do you think they're connected?

97
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,480
It was so blatant.

98
00:02:33,481 --> 00:02:34,470
It was ridiculous.

99
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,060
But you can keep going with the pardon's.

100
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,590
There are a lot of examples of that.

101
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,510
So to call Hillary Clinton,

102
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,390
not corrupt the uranium one deal.

103
00:02:42,391 --> 00:02:43,380
Go ahead and look that up.

104
00:02:43,381 --> 00:02:43,861
What's that?

105
00:02:43,861 --> 00:02:44,430
What's Uranian?

106
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:44,820
Well.

107
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:45,211
Well,

108
00:02:45,211 --> 00:02:45,541
uh,

109
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:46,020
the,

110
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:46,081
uh,

111
00:02:46,081 --> 00:02:49,110
Canadian businessman bought
the Kazak in Kazakhstan,

112
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,960
used to be a part of the Soviet Union,

113
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:54,510
a uranium fields.

114
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,190
Uh,

115
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:55,520
some of them,

116
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,090
some huge uranium fields.

117
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,740
I think some of the biggest in the world.

118
00:02:59,140 --> 00:02:59,960
You're writing him.

119
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,970
What do you use to make nuclear weapons?

120
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:02,830
Oh Shit.

121
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,690
And Bill Clinton,

122
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:04,841
uh,

123
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:05,531
help to his,

124
00:03:05,531 --> 00:03:06,460
it was his influence,

125
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:11,440
a well documented influence help this
Canadian businessman by those uranium

126
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:11,890
fields.

127
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:12,850
But here's the problem.

128
00:03:12,851 --> 00:03:17,590
That Canadian businessman gave $31
million to the Clinton Foundation with a

129
00:03:17,591 --> 00:03:22,591
pledge for 100 million more and he gave
Clinton a $500,000 check for speaking

130
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:30,170
for a speech and then 500,000 sounds.

131
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,070
Then when it came time for the Clinton

132
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,390
dinosaur bones sell for a
lot of money at auctions.

133
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,040
It is a profitable business.

134
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,980
There is pressure for
academics to publish papers.

135
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,970
Museums are in the business of
producing displays that are popular and

136
00:03:44,971 --> 00:03:45,420
appealing.

137
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:49,260
What the nonprofit is a business
need to produce material to sell,

138
00:03:49,261 --> 00:03:50,370
to stay in business.

139
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:55,410
The mainstream media loves to hype alleged
dinosaur fines much just to be gained

140
00:03:55,411 --> 00:04:00,411
by converting a bland non
dinosaur discovery of a bone
of modern origin into an

141
00:04:00,961 --> 00:04:02,160
impressive dinosaur.

142
00:04:02,161 --> 00:04:06,540
Find and letting artists interpretations
and imaginations take the spotlight.

143
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:06,941
Okay.

144
00:04:06,941 --> 00:04:08,340
Other than the basic boring,

145
00:04:08,341 --> 00:04:09,174
real fine.

146
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:09,880
Um,

147
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,100
if,

148
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,280
if that's true,

149
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:12,370
uh,

150
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:14,670
the why do dinosaurs become passe?

151
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,580
Why does somebody like me who has been on,

152
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:18,510
I don't know,

153
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:19,051
13,

154
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:21,990
14 different television shows
talking about paleontology,

155
00:04:21,991 --> 00:04:22,950
geology and all that.

156
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,710
I have pitched dinosaur,

157
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,340
like live dig stuff to
BBC and all of that.

158
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,680
I'm consulting on a
couple projects right now,

159
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:32,161
unfortunately,

160
00:04:32,161 --> 00:04:32,994
can't name them,

161
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:33,983
but,

162
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:34,620
uh,

163
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,390
dinosaurs become passe very,

164
00:04:36,391 --> 00:04:37,920
very quickly because people are like,

165
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:38,221
oh,

166
00:04:38,221 --> 00:04:38,461
cool,

167
00:04:38,461 --> 00:04:39,840
new dinosaurs town yet big deal.

168
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:40,891
Or Oh,

169
00:04:40,891 --> 00:04:42,090
well brontosauruses sources back.

170
00:04:42,091 --> 00:04:42,251
Yeah,

171
00:04:42,251 --> 00:04:43,084
whatever.

172
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,180
But the main stream media,

173
00:04:45,181 --> 00:04:46,014
as you said,

174
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,640
is just like,

175
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:49,020
they love a dinosaurs story,

176
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:49,890
but that's bullshit.

177
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:51,210
That's absolute bullshit.

178
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:51,690
When was,

179
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:52,860
when was the last like,

180
00:04:52,861 --> 00:04:53,730
dinosaur document?

181
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:54,151
Yeah,

182
00:04:54,151 --> 00:04:54,481
there was,

183
00:04:54,481 --> 00:04:55,080
um,

184
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:55,950
uh,

185
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,023
uh,

186
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:58,561
what was it called?

187
00:04:58,561 --> 00:04:59,850
Autopsy of a t rex with,

188
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:00,120
uh,

189
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,240
my friend Tori and uh,

190
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,143
that,

191
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:03,480
that,

192
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:03,661
okay.

193
00:05:03,661 --> 00:05:04,920
That was a speculative science shows.

194
00:05:04,921 --> 00:05:08,130
It was like what happens if we found a
t rex and cut it open and do an autopsy?

195
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:14,090
That was a hit and then paleontology
TV died again two years ago.

196
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,590
I had a net to our national geographic
documentary about digging up wooly

197
00:05:19,591 --> 00:05:22,170
mammoths in that it errored a night.

198
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:24,810
There was a little bit
of press fucking done.

199
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,940
The production company that did the,

200
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:30,690
the the thing with nat geo
is out of business now,

201
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,830
just done.

202
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:32,611
It's like,

203
00:05:32,611 --> 00:05:33,570
really we're,

204
00:05:33,571 --> 00:05:37,320
we're pressured and to get this money
then why aren't we making fucking more?

205
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:42,590
Why Eric am I a bartender in addition
to a paleontologist in addition to

206
00:05:44,401 --> 00:05:45,780
somebody that's on TV,

207
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:48,960
if I'm making all this
big Pharma or sorry,

208
00:05:48,961 --> 00:05:52,020
big Paleo fucking money
if I'm such a shill.

209
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:52,830
Okay.

210
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:53,190
Yeah.

211
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:57,710
Is that why I'm a month behind on my car
payment right now is why I'm trying to

212
00:05:57,711 --> 00:05:59,060
scrape together rent.

213
00:05:59,270 --> 00:05:59,871
Fuck.

214
00:05:59,871 --> 00:06:02,570
You can aggressive.

215
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:03,680
I remember when you were like,

216
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:04,491
when I realized,

217
00:06:04,491 --> 00:06:06,890
cause I don't know at the time I
didn't know anything about fighting,

218
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:10,160
but then you were
explaining how like their,

219
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:13,100
they have these insanely deep combos.

220
00:06:13,101 --> 00:06:14,270
If this person does this,

221
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:19,271
they have all these moves like 19 moves
deep that like there's incredible.

222
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,600
So I think she's like that.

223
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,370
Like she has like if he does this,

224
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,270
you do this.

225
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,350
And if he does that and this,

226
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:24,621
this,

227
00:06:24,621 --> 00:06:24,831
this,

228
00:06:24,831 --> 00:06:25,281
and then that.

229
00:06:25,281 --> 00:06:25,731
And then that,

230
00:06:25,731 --> 00:06:26,450
and then that.

231
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:30,830
And they've done it all with like a
government team of psychologists who have

232
00:06:30,831 --> 00:06:33,560
fully analyzed him and no
out of fucking set him off.

233
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,150
And she did it last night.

234
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:37,370
She did it in every single fucking debate.

235
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,710
And it's not like she's the
one who's coming up with that.

236
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,800
She's got a team of the smartest,

237
00:06:42,801 --> 00:06:47,801
most manipulative people on planet
earth who baited him in to the fucking,

238
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:48,560
uh,

239
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,700
elections in the first place.

240
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:50,690
You saw that email,

241
00:06:50,691 --> 00:06:51,200
right?

242
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,950
Where they picked the three candidates
that they wanted to empower,

243
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:55,671
you know,

244
00:06:55,671 --> 00:06:56,750
or to like build up,

245
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,220
which was Trump,

246
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,560
what's his name?

247
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:00,140
But Cruz,

248
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,640
Ted fucking cruise.

249
00:07:01,641 --> 00:07:04,400
Cause he's also fool because he's a fool.

250
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:04,971
And the other,

251
00:07:04,971 --> 00:07:05,781
the sweet guy,

252
00:07:05,781 --> 00:07:06,371
the doctor,

253
00:07:06,371 --> 00:07:07,160
Rubio,

254
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:07,641
Rubio,

255
00:07:07,641 --> 00:07:08,151
Carson,

256
00:07:08,151 --> 00:07:08,871
Carson,

257
00:07:08,871 --> 00:07:09,231
you know,

258
00:07:09,231 --> 00:07:12,380
so like they pick the
three biggest fools days.

259
00:07:12,381 --> 00:07:12,711
They're like,

260
00:07:12,711 --> 00:07:12,981
all right,

261
00:07:12,981 --> 00:07:14,090
let's pump them up.

262
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,410
They pump them up.

263
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:20,120
The King of the fools made
his way into the fucking pres.

264
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:21,021
Somehow.

265
00:07:21,021 --> 00:07:21,351
They're like,

266
00:07:21,351 --> 00:07:22,190
are you fucking kidding?

267
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:23,024
We got Trump,

268
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,620
we got fucking Trump.

269
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:25,790
We got Trump.

270
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:26,590
Trump.

271
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:26,680
Oh,

272
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:26,961
hold on,

273
00:07:26,961 --> 00:07:28,190
let me go to the Trump file.

274
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,750
Oh my God.

275
00:07:29,751 --> 00:07:33,700
Listen to this audio of him talking
about graphing fucking girls.

276
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:34,011
She's like,

277
00:07:34,011 --> 00:07:34,281
okay,

278
00:07:34,281 --> 00:07:34,581
great.

279
00:07:34,581 --> 00:07:37,220
Let's use that and hold
onto that for a while.

280
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:37,521
Yeah,

281
00:07:37,521 --> 00:07:39,940
we'll do that on the day
before the second day.

282
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:40,281
Yeah,

283
00:07:40,281 --> 00:07:40,761
let's do that.

284
00:07:40,761 --> 00:07:42,650
And the day before the second debate,

285
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,091
you know what I mean?

286
00:07:44,091 --> 00:07:45,530
I think they gave it two days.

287
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:45,921
Yeah,

288
00:07:45,921 --> 00:07:47,140
two days to build Zimmer,

289
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:48,410
two days to build.

290
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,780
And then of course they were
probably working on like,

291
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:51,651
you know,

292
00:07:51,651 --> 00:07:52,850
months leading up to it.

293
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:53,121
They're like,

294
00:07:53,121 --> 00:07:57,650
let's find every single person that claims
Donald Trump groped them or that were

295
00:07:57,651 --> 00:07:58,910
groped by Donald Trump.

296
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,500
Anyone who's willing to claim
Donald Trump broke them.

297
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:02,870
Anybody wants to get on TV?

298
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:03,260
Yeah.

299
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:03,491
Yeah.

300
00:08:03,491 --> 00:08:04,324
How you guys failing.

301
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:04,620
And I,

302
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,421
but I have a feeling,

303
00:08:05,421 --> 00:08:05,631
I mean,

304
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:05,960
I don't,

305
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,860
I don't know for sure,

306
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:10,550
but my guess would be that if you
wanted to find people who said,

307
00:08:10,551 --> 00:08:10,761
yeah,

308
00:08:10,761 --> 00:08:12,020
Trump grabbed my pussy,

309
00:08:12,021 --> 00:08:13,520
it wouldn't be that fucking hard.

310
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,680
It's now like you're looking for bigfoot,

311
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,400
pretty easy to hunt them down,

312
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:24,040
you might guess.

313
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:24,760
Right?

314
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,160
Yeah.

315
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:25,791
But so,

316
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:27,650
so it wasn't like a hard thing to do.

317
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,330
It's a bread crumb trail.

318
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:29,750
Yeah.

319
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:30,740
He very simple,

320
00:08:30,741 --> 00:08:31,574
very easy.

321
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,740
And so it's like when
you realize like that,

322
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:36,320
then you start feeling this weird
compassion for him and you're like,

323
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:37,251
my God.

324
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:41,090
Even with all his like maliciousness
and like weird per Venus and stuff,

325
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,380
ultimately he,

326
00:08:42,381 --> 00:08:42,711
they,

327
00:08:42,711 --> 00:08:47,711
he's like a fucking bowl that got put
into a God damn ring with a matador.

328
00:08:47,781 --> 00:08:52,781
He's been doing this kind of bull fighting
for like 30 fucking years for better,

329
00:08:52,971 --> 00:08:53,804
for worse.

330
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:54,950
And he's,

331
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:57,550
we're watching what we saw last night.

332
00:08:57,551 --> 00:08:58,384
Yeah.

333
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:07,460
Okay.
