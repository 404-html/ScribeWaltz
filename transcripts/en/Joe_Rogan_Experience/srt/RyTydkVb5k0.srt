00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:02,890
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:07,650
Whenever I'm at the UFC and
somebody gets kicked in the face,

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,480
I just always,

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:13,470
I just think about how disappointed I
be if I got kicked in the face of it,

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:14,581
what did I do?

6
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:15,021
Am I alive?

7
00:00:15,021 --> 00:00:16,320
Why somebody kicking me in the face?

8
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,690
Even especially,

9
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:22,650
I mean you never been kicked in the
face which has been kicked in the face.

10
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,930
Especially like that's why I'm glad I
didn't fight that guy and I'm glad I

11
00:00:27,931 --> 00:00:28,121
don't.

12
00:00:28,121 --> 00:00:28,650
I don't,

13
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:29,011
you know,

14
00:00:29,011 --> 00:00:31,500
put myself in situations where I've got
to fight a stranger because you never

15
00:00:31,501 --> 00:00:32,910
know where.

16
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:33,650
I'm just,

17
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:35,340
if I was to be fighting,

18
00:00:35,341 --> 00:00:37,830
I'm trying to throw hands poorly,

19
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,640
but if somebody just kicked
me in the face and I'm like,

20
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:41,881
oh,

21
00:00:41,881 --> 00:00:42,360
I didn't,

22
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,770
I didn't know you were going to do that.

23
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:46,040
This Donald Cerrone combination.

24
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:46,611
God Damn,

25
00:00:46,611 --> 00:00:47,444
that's beautiful.

26
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,190
Left high kick,

27
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,113
boom.

28
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:51,470
Turn his back.

29
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:52,970
That is Matrix Shit.

30
00:00:52,971 --> 00:00:55,310
Donald Cerrone lives
in the fucking Matrix,

31
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:55,790
dude,

32
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:56,360
right now.

33
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,030
All of a sudden he's coming
on the podcast next week.

34
00:00:59,031 --> 00:00:59,690
Jamie,

35
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:00,740
he's here on next Tuesday.

36
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:02,060
I'm going to fucking convince him.

37
00:01:02,061 --> 00:01:03,200
Live on the Internet.

38
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:08,210
Don't drop down from one 70
and one 70 is a fucking wizard.

39
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:10,520
Who the hell is stopping
and Rick story like this?

40
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:11,810
Oh Man.

41
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:13,490
Donald Cerrone is a fucking wizard.

42
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,830
He's a wizard at one 70.

43
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:21,530
If it felt it felt kind
of barbaric or archaic,

44
00:01:21,661 --> 00:01:26,661
but when you have money on somebody and
they're beating the shit out of somebody

45
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:29,130
else and you're winning,

46
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:33,590
it's a different type of emotion.

47
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:36,840
When he went Serone started
fucking that dude up,

48
00:01:36,841 --> 00:01:37,674
I stood up like

49
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:40,930
you were in there with them.

50
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:44,780
I was in there in there with him
for a couple thousand dollars.

51
00:01:44,781 --> 00:01:45,291
Hell yeah.

52
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:46,124
I was with him.

53
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,750
I was in Flint.

54
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:48,943
Fucking,

55
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,270
I appreciate your loyalty.

56
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,133
First of all,

57
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:54,600
it's both on it and Donald Ronnie Dope.

58
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:55,860
And then,

59
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:56,520
uh,

60
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,353
Johnson,

61
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:57,840
uh,

62
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,960
I bet on Johnson right
before the fight started.

63
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:01,510
I was like,

64
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,310
Huh,

65
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,143
what would the aunt,

66
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,650
he was minus two 50.

67
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:05,763
So

68
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,720
pretty reasonable considering how hard

69
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,110
and the one,

70
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:09,943
it's so fast.

71
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,020
I got on it.

72
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:11,841
We think it's,

73
00:02:11,841 --> 00:02:13,700
somebody told me I have to research it.

74
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:14,863
Please do.

75
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:18,920
Was that the fastest knockout in the
history of the light heavyweight division?

76
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:23,330
It was 13 seconds or something
longer to place my bet.

77
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:25,450
He hit so hard.

78
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:26,610
That happened so fast.

79
00:02:26,611 --> 00:02:28,730
It was like he hit so hard.

80
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,080
It happens so quick.

81
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,360
When Glover started pressuring him,

82
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:33,080
like what?

83
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,400
When I score a fight or
rather a commentator fight
when I watch something like

84
00:02:37,401 --> 00:02:37,491
that.

85
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:37,830
And I'm like,

86
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:38,301
okay,

87
00:02:38,301 --> 00:02:41,210
what can glow overdue
and what can rumble too?

88
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,550
We know rumble has
awesome stand up skills.

89
00:02:43,551 --> 00:02:45,530
We know we had a college
wrestling background.

90
00:02:45,531 --> 00:02:48,890
We know he's a really powerful and
he's probably the hardest hit are ever.

91
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,240
So what can glow over do?

92
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,070
He's really technical.

93
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,660
He can survive a storm.

94
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,090
Maybe he could take him down.

95
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,620
Maybe he can get them into deep water.

96
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,530
So he starts out super aggressive.

97
00:02:59,531 --> 00:02:59,921
Bob and,

98
00:02:59,921 --> 00:03:04,921
and we even Tyson style and one
haymaker one haymaker uppercut.

99
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,250
So Start Brian Jimmo third.

100
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:09,701
Wow.

101
00:03:09,701 --> 00:03:10,600
Seven seconds.

102
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,720
Goddamn Brian Chimo uh,

103
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,451
rest in peace.

104
00:03:13,451 --> 00:03:13,991
Ryan Gmo.

105
00:03:13,991 --> 00:03:15,130
He just died recently.

106
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:16,900
I run over by a car and Canada.

107
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:17,853
Oh Shit.

108
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:20,460
That's James Irvin Sandman.

109
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:21,700
Eight seconds.

110
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,713
Who did he fight?

111
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:28,600
And then John's rumbled jobs that gamble.

112
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,950
It's a gamble on that.

113
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:32,320
And then have it happen that fast.

114
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,940
That's like fucking crabs.

115
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:40,330
They should put like a 32nd over
under on summer rumbles fights does is

116
00:03:40,331 --> 00:03:44,320
literally a 32nd because
he's so scary right now.

117
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,210
He's so scary.

118
00:03:46,211 --> 00:03:48,250
He hits guys in a totally different way.

119
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:53,320
It's like he knows something that nobody
knows about how to hit people because

120
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:53,891
this dude,

121
00:03:53,891 --> 00:03:54,850
what was that guy's record?

122
00:03:54,851 --> 00:03:57,460
34 25 Oh four Alexander.

123
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:58,383
Eight seconds.

124
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,140
That's right.

125
00:03:59,140 --> 00:03:59,830
What was the guy,

126
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:00,970
Johnson faults record?

127
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,510
Was it 25 like he was an elite fighter.

128
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:05,140
Oh,

129
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,980
clover is beyond elite.

130
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,070
Glover's fought for the title.

131
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,460
He had a five round fight with Jon Jones.

132
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:13,510
Went to the distance.

133
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,020
Yeah,

134
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:17,240
so it's one of the best
fighters in the world.

135
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:19,310
Glover's excellent desk.

136
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:19,991
Go crazy.

137
00:04:19,991 --> 00:04:22,360
They got gotten 13 seconds.

138
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:22,850
You don't want it.

139
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:23,081
It is,

140
00:04:23,081 --> 00:04:23,470
man.

141
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,570
There's the human frame.

142
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:27,040
You know,

143
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,270
like the skull,

144
00:04:28,271 --> 00:04:29,170
the brain,

145
00:04:29,171 --> 00:04:32,170
the neck can only take so much.

146
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:34,450
It just can only take so much.

147
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:34,780
Yeah,

148
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,570
and most people can't hit that bell.

149
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:41,740
You know that bell when you go to the
carnival and he slammed down on that bell

150
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:43,460
and the little thing goes up and

151
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,260
most people can't make that thing.

152
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:47,920
Dang.

153
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,680
In this world for Rumble Johnson,

154
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:55,720
he can make that thing ding
every time with is open barrage.

155
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,260
Yeah.

156
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,610
With his first,

157
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:58,140
you know,

158
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,670
name the number 200 punches and kicks,

159
00:05:00,671 --> 00:05:01,504
whatever it is,

160
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,010
he can knock you the fuck out.

161
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:08,310
The question with a guy like that is
if he gets past that 200 number and the

162
00:05:08,411 --> 00:05:09,820
opponent is still there,

163
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,230
can he make it through it?

164
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:13,150
And that's what happened
in the Cormier fight.

165
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:16,930
It's like rumble hit core me with
everything but the kitchen sink.

166
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:20,320
But Cohlmia is so fucking tough.

167
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:25,690
He's so tough from being in a world
class Olympic wrestler from a guy who

168
00:05:25,691 --> 00:05:27,070
competed all over the world.

169
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,360
He's just got this,

170
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:33,650
this is like a level of toughness that
you can't recreate and he takes a big

171
00:05:33,731 --> 00:05:36,160
bomb but figures out how
to scramble and survive.

172
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:36,870
Yeah.

173
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,320
And so he makes it into,

174
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,040
um,

175
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,331
what,

176
00:05:39,331 --> 00:05:39,561
what,

177
00:05:39,561 --> 00:05:41,620
what rounded core may submit rumble.

178
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,520
See the thing about a guy like rumble
though is you could submit them once,

179
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:53,970
but once he figures out what you did
and he remembers how much it sucked when

180
00:05:54,101 --> 00:05:55,150
you did that to him,

181
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,650
can you do it again?

182
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:58,580
And if you can't do it again,

183
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:01,820
what if he can figure out
how to keep it standing?

184
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:02,810
Yeah.

185
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:07,430
What if he could figure out how to keep
hitting you with those barrages of heavy

186
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:11,390
bones common flying at you
with perfect technique.

187
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,390
He hit us so fucking hard,

188
00:06:14,391 --> 00:06:15,224
man.

189
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,420
What third round?

190
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:19,140
Well,

191
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,570
Cormy took them into deep water,

192
00:06:20,571 --> 00:06:21,350
man.

193
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:22,183
Okay.

194
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:28,170
[inaudible].
