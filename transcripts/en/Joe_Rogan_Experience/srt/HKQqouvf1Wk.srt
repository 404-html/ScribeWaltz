00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,223
Trey,
my daddy Joe Rogan podcast by night all 

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,660
day now.
There's so much going on.

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:06,563
Supplement Scott,
you have to make sure you put it in the 

4
00:00:07,501 --> 00:00:09,660
research and investigation.
Speaking in your body.

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,553
I poke and did you see that picture of 
Travis Brown's finger knuckle deep into 

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,340
from silver dooms eyeball?
He didn't even say anything in the fight

7
00:00:17,341 --> 00:00:18,174
right there for doom.
I don't remember seeing [inaudible] I 

8
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,650
call home or anything on that.
I don't remember.

9
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,070
I did see that jump,
that jump psychic in the beginning.

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,553
You get the hand on his trainer res.
It was a cool without that fight there 

11
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:31,270
was cool,
cool,

12
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:32,550
cool fight.
Well it was,

13
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:33,413
it was Obama to me to see Travis fight 
like that because I remember travis 

14
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,600
earlier in his career was just to look 
at that picture.

15
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:42,660
That is fucking insane.
Esther,

16
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,350
Esther Lynn from all elbows on 
Instagram,

17
00:00:46,351 --> 00:00:49,380
put this picture up and um,
she's an mma,

18
00:00:49,381 --> 00:00:50,280
a photographer.

19
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,200
She takes awesome pictures to an awesome
picture.

20
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:53,520
And this is insane.
I mean,

21
00:00:53,521 --> 00:00:56,670
it is literally knuckled deep in his 
eyeball.

22
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,710
It just,
it's hard to look at,

23
00:00:58,711 --> 00:00:59,550
man.
It's just,

24
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,290
Oh my God.
That though too.

25
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:02,440
Right?
There's middle knuckle.

26
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:05,610
It's like this finger has disappeared in
the eyeball.

27
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,280
I don't remember him stopping or saying 
I poke or anything.

28
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,870
I don't remember either.
Let's focus.

29
00:01:09,871 --> 00:01:14,100
But there was a bad one earlier in the 
night with Jimmy Rivera and a Uriah.

30
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,170
Yeah.
That was a bad one.

31
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,570
And Jimmy Rivera after the fights that 
he couldn't see,

32
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,220
you still couldn't see.
He's like,

33
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:24,010
he said he couldn't tell what color 
things were out of his right eye.

34
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,280
Yeah.
Fucking I pokes man.

35
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:27,203
Pride gloves.
Huh?

36
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:28,123
You got to redesign the gloves.
A little bit of a car to turn there and 

37
00:01:29,691 --> 00:01:30,660
that opened all the way.
Sorry.

38
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,860
No,
I think you're right.

39
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,930
Most of the time,
this is what I do.

40
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,540
I obsess about Marsha lives to making 
things better.

41
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,390
Someone's got to do something because 
the way things are going,

42
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,253
we're just so many guys are getting,
I go so many guys getting damaged 

43
00:01:42,451 --> 00:01:43,560
eyeballs.
It's just,

44
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:44,880
it's not worth it,
man.

45
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,700
And it seems like we're waiting for 
something terrible to happen.

46
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,440
You know,
like look at Michael Bisping,

47
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,350
I dunno.
Bisping's came from a kick though.

48
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,600
I feel like it might have come from 
vittores kick.

49
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,690
What was it that,
or was it in practice?

50
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,610
I don't know.
Do you think it was in practice?

51
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,100
I think he detached his retina a couple 
times,

52
00:02:02,101 --> 00:02:03,720
so I think that's why it is the way it 
is.

53
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:07,470
I think he's heard it multiple times and
it was kind of where it,

54
00:02:07,471 --> 00:02:09,540
cause it's not completely fixed.
I think they fixed it enough to where he

55
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:10,374
can fight and then when he's done 
fighting they'll probably fix is I 

56
00:02:11,761 --> 00:02:12,594
completed these what it seems like,
well what they did is they stuck oil in 

57
00:02:15,061 --> 00:02:15,894
his eye.

58
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:17,003
I don't understand it,
but one of his eyeballs apparently has 

59
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,113
oil in it that's protecting the retina.
So that's why one of his eyeballs is 

60
00:02:24,661 --> 00:02:26,500
black,
like you know.

61
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,413
Yeah.
I was wondering what was going on with 

62
00:02:27,931 --> 00:02:28,800
desires.
That's why.

63
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:29,683
Yeah.
One is black and one is his original 

64
00:02:31,021 --> 00:02:32,280
aicar,
which I'm not sure what it is,

65
00:02:32,281 --> 00:02:34,530
but it's very strange looking,
but it's just,

66
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:38,040
he's a fucking savage.
I mean he didn't even consider retiring.

67
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:38,531
He's like,
Hey,

68
00:02:38,531 --> 00:02:39,540
yeah,
stick some oil in there.

69
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:41,910
Let's get going whenever I reckon do put
an eyepatch on.

70
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:44,070
Let's do this.
Got To get back to the gym mate.

71
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,460
He does push it.
That guy comes to fight.

72
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,313
He such an Amo.
Michael Bisping is the middleweight 

73
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,010
champion of the world.
And who saw that coming?

74
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,320
He did.
He did.

75
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:56,010
Yep.
I seen that opening in,

76
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:56,641
uh,
in,

77
00:02:56,641 --> 00:02:57,474
uh,
luke rockhold to instagram videos 

78
00:02:58,351 --> 00:02:59,260
leading up to the fight.

79
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,720
I seen the same thing his trainer saw.
Really?

80
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,100
Yeah.
He just leaned it back.

81
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:03,963
He was telling me weeks before the fight
that things he was doing while he's 

82
00:03:06,851 --> 00:03:07,684
hitting meds,
dropping his right hand all the time 

83
00:03:08,711 --> 00:03:11,670
with his left cross and kind of leaning 
back and kind of shoulder roll and,

84
00:03:11,671 --> 00:03:12,504
and whatnot.
And Duane called it out a couple of 

85
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,430
weeks before the fight that he saw 
openings.

86
00:03:15,431 --> 00:03:16,264
You know,
he didn't say he was gonna get knocked 

87
00:03:16,481 --> 00:03:17,950
out with it,
but he saw some openings there,

88
00:03:17,951 --> 00:03:18,784
you know,
is there,

89
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,250
I mean that's it.
It's pretty simple.

90
00:03:20,251 --> 00:03:22,300
You can see where the openings are on 
that one for sure.

91
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,141
And,
uh,

92
00:03:23,141 --> 00:03:25,890
I remember after bisbing caught him and 
his trainer point Adam,

93
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,530
and I'm not quite sure what he said and 
left,

94
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:28,720
but he was for sure.
I was saying,

95
00:03:28,721 --> 00:03:30,300
I could see,
I told you I told you like that one.

96
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,860
Yeah.
Yes.

97
00:03:32,861 --> 00:03:34,240
Yeah.
He's a good boxing coach.

98
00:03:34,241 --> 00:03:36,010
He understands the game.
I got respect for that guy.

99
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,173
Um,
but it's cool to see something you've 

100
00:03:38,231 --> 00:03:41,230
trained multiple times come out and 
actually work.

101
00:03:41,231 --> 00:03:42,970
And then when the fight and then the 
title fight.

102
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,220
Ooh,
that's,

103
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,590
that's nice.
That's rewarding.

104
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:46,733
That's what I wanted to bring up to you.
What did you think about the Travis 

105
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,593
Browne?
Fabrizio over doing five where we're 

106
00:03:50,411 --> 00:03:53,940
travis called time.
He got his finger jammed for Breeshia,

107
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:58,270
threw a punch and Travis Travis has 
finger apparently broke and there's some

108
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:00,130
photos of it now online.
It was,

109
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,550
it's fucking nasty.
Like,

110
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,573
shows you how tough travis is that he 
continued with his finger was smashed 

111
00:04:06,161 --> 00:04:09,430
and it was a compound fracture where the
bone broke through the skin.

112
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:10,743
That's one picture,
but there's some even better ones that 

113
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:13,120
he released today.
Well,

114
00:04:13,121 --> 00:04:14,170
you could see it,
uh,

115
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,100
after the fight.

116
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:16,683
It was a nasty break,
but so it was a weird thing where for 

117
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:20,384
resale through this punch and he threw 
like one of those chocolate dell style 

118
00:04:23,261 --> 00:04:24,094
over hands.
It come over the top and it landed on 

119
00:04:26,321 --> 00:04:29,110
the fingers of Travis and snapped one of
his finger.

120
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,183
So Travis calls time,
which you really can't do is look at my 

121
00:04:32,921 --> 00:04:35,710
fingers fucked up calls time like,
oh wow.

122
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,150
Scroll up though.
When you see it.

123
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:38,260
The actual opening.
Yeah.

124
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,870
Here comes the boom.
He says time out,

125
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:41,530
right?
Yeah.

126
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:45,550
Given James said he cannot do that.
I missed I guess Marie Smith.

127
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,920
Did they stop?
Did they go?

128
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,180
Sorry.
Sorry.

129
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:49,991
Oh,
that's right.

130
00:04:49,991 --> 00:04:50,960
You did that boss.
Yeah.

131
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:52,470
You did that in a fight.
I,

132
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,300
yeah,
I get,

133
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,310
yeah,
but if Maurice,

134
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:55,420
no,
I did.

135
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,410
I liked that.
Yeah.

136
00:04:56,411 --> 00:04:57,244
I kicked him in the head and then I,
I got excited and wanted to give him 

137
00:04:59,501 --> 00:05:00,334
another kick in the head,
but I slip and a fall on the ground and 

138
00:05:01,891 --> 00:05:04,000
Maurice wants to jump on top of me and I
put my head up.

139
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,833
I say,
wait,

140
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,460
he stops and I'm getting up,
and I go,

141
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,970
thank you.
That's good closure.

142
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,730
That's an adjacent trick.
Yeah.

143
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,830
And another one to help,
fairly funny,

144
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:19,870
anybody with a Jason de Lucia.
I dropped her with this liver shot,

145
00:05:19,871 --> 00:05:20,704
right?
And then I walked over to him and you 

146
00:05:21,761 --> 00:05:26,410
see what I'm doing as stretch my arm 
above me and I wave with my hand and you

147
00:05:26,411 --> 00:05:29,890
see him look it up to my head,
and then I live or kick him again.

148
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,890
I just put my hand up and say,
yeah,

149
00:05:32,891 --> 00:05:33,724
look at this.
And it looks,

150
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,670
he actually look there.
That's fine.

151
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,060
That's good composure.
Right?

152
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:38,830
We actually use that stuff all the time.
