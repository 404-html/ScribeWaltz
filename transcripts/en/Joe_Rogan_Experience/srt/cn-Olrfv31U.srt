1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:04,080
I think what you said is dead on that
you got to go straight.

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:08,090
He's got to go straight African-american
because white people are just not heavy

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,370
and we're live.
This is what I think we need to

4
00:00:11,371 --> 00:00:15,690
recognize the return of Dr Cosby and uh,
send a shout out to him and all the

5
00:00:15,691 --> 00:00:15,920
folks.

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,150
So the barbershops,
I'm triggered.

7
00:00:19,151 --> 00:00:19,984
I'm triggered.

8
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:24,160
You were saying before the show,
like what do you do if you're at a

9
00:00:24,161 --> 00:00:27,400
comedy club and bill cosby walks?
Cause apparently bill cosby's doing

10
00:00:27,401 --> 00:00:29,710
standup again.
They're like what do you do?

11
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,140
Why isn't he in jail?
I'm not even sure.

12
00:00:34,141 --> 00:00:35,240
I'm like,
I'm not sure to be funny.

13
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,570
Why guy in jail?

14
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:40,930
Cause the first first trial was,
was it a mistrial?

15
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:41,823
Yeah.
Yeah,

16
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,790
there was a mistrial.
Um,

17
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,610
they couldn't agree,
which is hilarious.

18
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:49,510
Like I mean how many people have to say
that guy fucking drug me and rape me.

19
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,400
How many people?
Like is there some sort of,

20
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:56,700
could you imagine there's like 80 people
that are telling the same story of you

21
00:00:56,711 --> 00:01:00,390
drugging them and raping them and people
like that.

22
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,130
So on the Logan,
here's what I'll say.

23
00:01:03,131 --> 00:01:04,250
Like the soccer up two years.
No,

24
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,210
I'm sorry.
Sorry.

25
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,230
I just,
I don't want anything black a little bit

26
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:09,670
right now.
We're talking about bill cosby.

27
00:01:09,671 --> 00:01:13,780
This is too soon for this.
I guess I just,

28
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,730
you know,
and it's interesting that this happened

29
00:01:15,731 --> 00:01:18,460
after this weekend was the women's March
and I know like a lot of people want to

30
00:01:18,461 --> 00:01:20,920
roll their eyes and I was getting a lot
of shit on instagram for like the

31
00:01:20,921 --> 00:01:21,950
women's March.
You guys have it.

32
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:26,970
This is exactly the kind of thing that
I'm terrified of is that this guy is now

33
00:01:27,281 --> 00:01:29,610
not in jail and he's just like back to
doing standup.

34
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,940
Yeah.
Because I don't know if we've got

35
00:01:30,941 --> 00:01:35,380
desensitized or if we just forgot about
him or we just got sick of talking about

36
00:01:35,381 --> 00:01:36,011
it.
Like how,

37
00:01:36,011 --> 00:01:38,020
I just don't understand how people in
that plumbing,

38
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,900
I think he's the,
first of all,

39
00:01:39,901 --> 00:01:44,670
he has an enormous ego and he's a
psychopath and I think that he is,

40
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:48,740
he's just,
he has enough fans in,

41
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:53,460
enough people in his community still
love him or he can go places and small

42
00:01:53,461 --> 00:01:55,320
places and they accept him.
And then he's,

43
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,090
he's uh,
he's advertising it.

44
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,990
And what is twitter people that except
him with this?

45
00:01:59,991 --> 00:02:03,170
Is it people who have their own
skeletons in the closet and they see him

46
00:02:03,171 --> 00:02:05,810
coming back?
It's like they get redemption in some

47
00:02:05,811 --> 00:02:10,190
way or maybe it makes them not be
incorrigible people or is it like a herd

48
00:02:10,191 --> 00:02:13,760
mentality or is it just star fucking
like how do you rationalize that in your

49
00:02:13,761 --> 00:02:15,330
head?
A little bit of Star fucking okay.

50
00:02:15,331 --> 00:02:17,690
A little bit of dumb.
The fact that he's famous eclipse is the

51
00:02:17,691 --> 00:02:18,550
fact that he is,

52
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:19,840
yeah,
psychopathic.

53
00:02:19,841 --> 00:02:24,610
But then there's also,
do you remember how it was right after

54
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:27,640
Oj got innocent?
There was a guy,

55
00:02:27,641 --> 00:02:29,410
and I want to say his name because I
respect him.

56
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,140
He's a comic and he went on stage.
He said,

57
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,251
no,
he's a black guy.

58
00:02:33,251 --> 00:02:36,610
He goes,
my blackness will not allow me to think

59
00:02:36,611 --> 00:02:38,080
that Oj did it.
And I,

60
00:02:38,081 --> 00:02:39,940
uh,
I was interesting.

61
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,430
It was like,
what now?

62
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:45,640
What the fuck did I just hear like that?
It's insane.

63
00:02:45,641 --> 00:02:46,031
Like,
okay,

64
00:02:46,031 --> 00:02:48,790
all black people are innocent.
What does a black person comes in and

65
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:52,060
kills your family?
Will your blackness exonerate that

66
00:02:52,061 --> 00:02:52,990
person?
Like how,

67
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:53,970
how are you going to handle it then?

68
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,390
And I don't know what the demo,
I mean,

69
00:02:56,391 --> 00:02:57,950
what were,
do you know who was in that job?

70
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,470
Was it all black people?
I know.

71
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:00,230
Anything.

72
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:01,690
I can't read it.
Like I'm just,

73
00:03:01,691 --> 00:03:03,670
I'm sick to my stomach.
You're going to be,

74
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,530
no.
If it's a,

75
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:10,590
I don't know if it's a blown bit when
rape culture on stage performing and

76
00:03:10,631 --> 00:03:14,470
there's not like a complete melee of
disapproval.

77
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,630
That's really scary to me.
It is scary.

78
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,550
It's scary.
But I think that,

79
00:03:18,551 --> 00:03:20,200
uh,
there's a certain amount of people that

80
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:22,720
get overwhelmed by celebrity,
so he shows up.

81
00:03:22,721 --> 00:03:23,800
Like,
I can't believe he's here.

82
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,860
They don't want to say Manson goes up at
a jazz club.

83
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,110
It's like he's a celebrity,
but he's also a Charles Manson.

84
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,770
Less of a monster.
Here's why.

85
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,900
I'll throw this at you.
He never killed anybody.

86
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:39,040
Charles Manson actually told people to
kill people and they did.

87
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:42,760
And it's terrible that they did it.
Like Tex Watson did all the crimes and

88
00:03:42,761 --> 00:03:43,594
um,
uh,

89
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,190
what was her name?
Squeaky fromme.

90
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,200
She was wanting to try to kill Gerald
Ford.

91
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,420
They,
they're the one who did the crimes.

92
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,960
He was just this crazy fuck who talked
these people into these things.

93
00:03:52,961 --> 00:03:54,280
It's kind of the puppet master.
Yeah.

94
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:56,290
But that really scares me.
Raped,

95
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:00,160
who knows how many women and allegedly
it's also,

96
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,380
yeah,
it's also,

97
00:04:02,381 --> 00:04:03,070
um,
it just,

98
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:05,890
it scares me and shakes me to my core,
you know,

99
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,840
not that a psychopath does psychopathic
things,

100
00:04:07,841 --> 00:04:12,670
but the people who permit it and who are
permissive and are okay with it and

101
00:04:12,671 --> 00:04:14,410
don't resist,
like the fact that a bunch of people in

102
00:04:14,411 --> 00:04:15,221
that club were just like,
okay,

103
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:15,851
we're good.
Okay.

104
00:04:15,851 --> 00:04:17,650
We're all,
we don't really know what happened.

105
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,850
We just know that he was there and we
know that he's going to do another show.

106
00:04:21,851 --> 00:04:24,730
And then he announced that he was going
to do some show at a jazz club.

107
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,680
It's like today,
I think,

108
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,060
is it today or tomorrow?

109
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,320
And is this jazz club?
I mean,

110
00:04:31,321 --> 00:04:32,920
I don't know who owns it.
I don't know enough about it.

111
00:04:32,921 --> 00:04:35,560
Probably tonight.
And I'm like frozen with disgust.

112
00:04:35,561 --> 00:04:36,880
It's like,
that's the other thing is that

113
00:04:36,881 --> 00:04:38,950
yesterday,
so it's already over.

114
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,560
It's as promised,
he performed at a jazz club today,

115
00:04:41,561 --> 00:04:43,570
but this article is yesterday.
Wow.

116
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:44,960
That's promise.
Like,

117
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,550
oh,
he's a man of his word.

118
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,600
He might be a rapist.
He does not lie.

119
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,070
And he was wearing that hello friends
sweater that he always wears a fucking

120
00:04:54,071 --> 00:04:56,440
night and he's got that um,
Bobby Brown thing on,

121
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:01,870
I don't know what that is.
The microphone or the microphone

122
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:03,430
headpiece thing.
And I mean,

123
00:05:03,431 --> 00:05:05,380
I don't know.
It's just so tricky because it's like,

124
00:05:05,381 --> 00:05:07,960
I was getting all these nasty comments
on instagram this weekend.

125
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,430
Like,
why are you getting nasty comments for

126
00:05:09,431 --> 00:05:12,010
what I think with what's going on,
why,

127
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:15,910
why the guy was posting photos from the
women's March,

128
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,770
which was the march was about a lot of
things.

129
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:20,140
And I think just in the last month or
so,

130
00:05:20,141 --> 00:05:22,120
there's been a little bit of eye roll of
like,

131
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,190
oh,
this is still going on.

132
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,840
You know,
like there's a lot of,

133
00:05:25,841 --> 00:05:30,841
I think guys and women also who are a
little bit exhausted or I had one guy I

134
00:05:30,971 --> 00:05:33,130
talked to a couple of weeks ago,
a friend of mine who was like,

135
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:36,920
I'm done with this.
What do you mean you're done with that?

136
00:05:36,921 --> 00:05:38,030
It's like,
um,

137
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,760
we're done with,
uh,

138
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,000
sexual predators being,
um,

139
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,430
getting in trouble and getting fired her
and,

140
00:05:44,431 --> 00:05:48,370
and getting cleansed from our society
and hustled please,

141
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:51,340
you know,
stopping from assaulting people in the

142
00:05:51,341 --> 00:05:52,360
future.
And they were just to go,

143
00:05:52,361 --> 00:05:54,220
just do feel like this has gotten
ridiculous.

144
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,001
You know,
there's,

145
00:05:55,001 --> 00:05:57,980
I think a lot of people think it's like
a hysteria or it's like women

146
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,020
being dramatic,
um,

147
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,870
or something like that.
And then something like this happens and

148
00:06:02,871 --> 00:06:03,201
I'm like,
oh,

149
00:06:03,201 --> 00:06:07,250
are we not being dramatic enough because
this is crazy that he's just going on

150
00:06:07,251 --> 00:06:09,500
stage and performing.
Like as if everything's just kind of

151
00:06:09,501 --> 00:06:10,210
fine again.

152
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:12,190
Well,
I think he's a bad example because I

153
00:06:12,191 --> 00:06:14,410
think he's nuts and I don't think it
makes any sense.

154
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,500
I think anyone who rapes is treating
people is not,

155
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:19,320
I think all of these people are not,
I think we're more nuts for just being

156
00:06:19,321 --> 00:06:19,741
like,
okay,

157
00:06:19,741 --> 00:06:21,720
I guess he's doing comedy,
but I don't think we are.

158
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,150
I think most people were like,
what in the far outraged,

159
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:26,850
I sent it to Tom Segura and that was
his,

160
00:06:26,851 --> 00:06:31,851
his immediate reaction was like what?
He give me like a bunch of people who

161
00:06:31,951 --> 00:06:34,680
are in that jazz club and the guy that
owns that jazz club.

162
00:06:34,681 --> 00:06:36,640
Fuck you guys.
Um,

163
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:37,543
yeah,
we don't know.

164
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:39,450
I mean we don't know who these people
are.

165
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,360
If I'm in a comedy club in bill cosby
gets on stage and I'm like,

166
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:44,590
I got to hear what the fuck this bitch
has to say.

167
00:06:44,591 --> 00:06:47,880
Like that's what I'm thinking.
I'm not being like awesome bill cosby's

168
00:06:47,881 --> 00:06:50,190
here.
So maybe I should give them the benefit

169
00:06:50,191 --> 00:06:52,920
of the doubt and assume that they think
they're seeing some kind of circus show.

170
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:55,930
I don't think I would say anything.
I don't think,

171
00:06:55,931 --> 00:06:58,000
I mean I don't think it helps.
Like I don't think it was yellow.

172
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,230
I don't think I would do that.
But I definitely think I would sit there

173
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:07,770
and watch and like study him like some
weird fucking creature,

174
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,480
which is what he is.
He's,

175
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,970
he's an aberration in,
in humanity.

176
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,833
Like,
uh,

177
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,730
first of all,
he's an aberration a couple of ways.

178
00:07:15,731 --> 00:07:16,564
Right,
right.

179
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,680
He's an outlier in terms of the,
the,

180
00:07:18,681 --> 00:07:20,530
the,
the popularity he reached,

181
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:24,370
he reached us insane level of popular
and he did in the 60s and the 70s when

182
00:07:24,371 --> 00:07:25,810
the world was a different place.
Right.

183
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:28,210
And I really,
we've talked about this a bunch of times

184
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:30,940
as podcast.
I think a lot of people drug people back

185
00:07:30,941 --> 00:07:32,320
then,
I think it was normal.

186
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:35,010
I think that dropping a mickey and
someone's drinks,

187
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,790
it was common.
Maybe not normal.

188
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:37,530
Yeah.

189
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:40,680
That's a better way to put it.
I think a lot of people did it and I

190
00:07:40,681 --> 00:07:42,540
think a lot of people,
they will still do it.

191
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:43,560
Yeah.
Well,

192
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,230
but I think a lot of famous people did
it back then.

193
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:49,320
I think they were giving out pills.
And I don't think,

194
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:54,770
I think culturally we've evolved way
more than we are aware of.

195
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:59,670
I think we think of ourselves as being
very similar to people from the 1960s I

196
00:07:59,671 --> 00:08:02,430
don't think we are.
I think we're way,

197
00:08:02,431 --> 00:08:07,431
I think if you go from like 1810 to 1870
I bet people are pretty goddamn similar.

198
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:11,100
Interesting.
Yes.

199
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:11,963
Okay.
Good point.

200
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,980
Yeah.
I think technology's moving so fast and

201
00:08:13,981 --> 00:08:16,650
adapting to that and the fact that we
have alarm systems

202
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:20,680
got a 1960 to 2018 way different.
Yeah.

203
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:23,840
Fucking way different.
What's acceptable?

204
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:28,010
How people think of things,
what we've w just as how people,

205
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,260
I think one of the things that's
happening and one of the reasons why

206
00:08:30,261 --> 00:08:33,110
guys are eyebrow and about the women's
march is,

207
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:38,420
is that it's a new thing and this is an
overwhelming amount of energy that's

208
00:08:38,421 --> 00:08:42,470
headed towards this thing.
And but what it represents is years,

209
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,680
decades of frustration,
women that had to work with guys that

210
00:08:45,681 --> 00:08:48,290
were grabbing their ass.
I ain't trying to fuck them.

211
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:52,230
Pendulum swung hard.
It's like it snapped fast and,

212
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:53,690
and there's also,
we always talk about that.

213
00:08:53,691 --> 00:08:55,290
And I'm obsessed with epigenetic
imprinting.

214
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:57,720
It's not just us,
it's our moms and our grandmothers.

215
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,610
This happened to,
and we carry that pain and that,

216
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,060
yeah,

217
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:03,310
suffering with us.
There's a lot of guys that say,

218
00:09:03,311 --> 00:09:04,690
Hey,
I didn't do anything.

219
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,510
I shouldn't have to feel this,
but this is the thing,

220
00:09:07,511 --> 00:09:09,940
these guys saying like,
I'm done with this.

221
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,530
You're not even a part of this.
Like,

222
00:09:11,531 --> 00:09:12,570
how are you done with,
why is,

223
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:15,440
how is this inconveniencing you?
So like,

224
00:09:15,441 --> 00:09:17,450
I don't understand how the stuck in
traffic.

225
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,373
Well,
I guess

226
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:20,750
that's it.
I mean,

227
00:09:20,751 --> 00:09:22,270
that's exactly right.
So it's like a couple of,

228
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,210
I mean,
you're in La,

229
00:09:23,211 --> 00:09:25,090
you're always sitting in women's march
draft it.

230
00:09:25,091 --> 00:09:26,690
And I feel that we have who actually
better,

231
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:30,110
yeah,
the marathon and the gay pride parade

232
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,250
and the whatever.
So it's like,

233
00:09:31,251 --> 00:09:34,010
I'm so sorry you're going to have to
like sit in traffic for an extra 20

234
00:09:34,011 --> 00:09:34,780
minutes,
but like,

235
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,860
you know,
get your Amazon drone.

236
00:09:36,861 --> 00:09:38,360
Why are you driving on a Saturday
anyway?

237
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:39,530
I get it.
I mean,

238
00:09:39,531 --> 00:09:41,580
it makes sense.
If I just,

239
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:44,210
I guess I don't an office,
I fucking hate it.

240
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:48,000
I guess I just don't understand why this
is such a hassle for men.

241
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:51,930
I don't understand why it's such an,
unless you were raping people,

242
00:09:51,931 --> 00:09:54,450
assaulting people,
hurting people,

243
00:09:54,451 --> 00:09:57,300
nothing's being taken away from you.
And I feel like a lot of men thinks

244
00:09:57,301 --> 00:10:01,320
something's being taken away from them.
And I don't know what that is.

245
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:05,040
You know,
and I'm just a little bit confused if

246
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:06,660
it's unfollow me.
I don't know.

247
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:09,630
Unfollowed if it's blowing up your
twitter feed and your instagram.

248
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,240
I just,
I can't wrap my head around why this is

249
00:10:12,241 --> 00:10:15,600
such an inconvenience for guys.
So threatening

250
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:17,900
I don't think was that many guys that
are saying this.

251
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:23,500
Most men I think are recognizing that if
you look at the stories like the Harvey

252
00:10:23,721 --> 00:10:26,480
Weinstein one is the worst and most
egregious example,

253
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:27,321
right?
I mean,

254
00:10:27,321 --> 00:10:32,321
he's a guy that did it for decades.
They even enabled him to bill cosby's

255
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:33,770
worse,
right?

256
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:38,360
Because cosby was like,
Harvey Weinstein was an obvious

257
00:10:38,361 --> 00:10:39,320
Predator.
It's like,

258
00:10:39,321 --> 00:10:39,980
Hey,
don't,

259
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,420
don't go in the chicken coop with the
wool.

260
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,900
And here's something interesting.
I was also getting shit about this,

261
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,210
about,
um,

262
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,630
a lot of people were like,
well,

263
00:10:46,631 --> 00:10:48,820
if you knew about Harvey,
why didn't you say something?

264
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,790
And it's just,
it's such a testament to how,

265
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,770
um,
who's someone said that.

266
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,170
Yeah.
Like I just got some comments that were

267
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:56,381
like,
well,

268
00:10:56,381 --> 00:10:58,090
you knew about Harvey,
why didn't you say something?

269
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,950
You know,
when you knew about it 10 years ago or

270
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:00,850
whatever it,
you know,

271
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,980
but I,
I had heard like,

272
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:04,800
Oh,
he likes sleeps with actresses and he

273
00:11:04,801 --> 00:11:07,330
like makes them fuck them.
But I wasn't really in that world,

274
00:11:07,331 --> 00:11:09,010
so I knew about it.
But what was I going to call it?

275
00:11:09,011 --> 00:11:09,940
The New York Times,
you'd be like,

276
00:11:09,941 --> 00:11:11,950
Hey,
I was on comedy central for 10 minutes.

277
00:11:11,951 --> 00:11:13,410
I have an idea.
Right.

278
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,920
You know,
like who was going to let you know?

279
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,810
And it's also,
it's like the kind of thing where we

280
00:11:16,811 --> 00:11:21,610
didn't even know what we were allowed to
say and we didn't even know that there

281
00:11:21,611 --> 00:11:24,970
was a possibility for change or that
there was a possibility that anything

282
00:11:24,971 --> 00:11:28,060
would be done about it.
Like that's how I'm ingrained in our

283
00:11:28,061 --> 00:11:28,811
psyche.
It was.

284
00:11:28,811 --> 00:11:30,610
And how we just didn't know there was
anything.

285
00:11:30,611 --> 00:11:31,510
We just thought that's how it was.

286
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,371
Well,
first of all,

287
00:11:32,371 --> 00:11:34,350
you didn't know him.
You didn't work under him.

288
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:37,630
He did come to the comedy store ones.
I think you were gone.

289
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:40,120
And this isn't like my Harvey Weinstein
story,

290
00:11:40,121 --> 00:11:43,870
like it's not close to how awful most of
the women's stories are,

291
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:45,580
but it is,
I think more like kind of funny.

292
00:11:45,581 --> 00:11:48,100
He came to the comedy store and,
uh,

293
00:11:48,101 --> 00:11:49,930
I,
I went on stage to the main room and

294
00:11:49,931 --> 00:11:51,670
then I left.
And then Tommy called me and he was

295
00:11:51,671 --> 00:11:51,851
like,
oh,

296
00:11:51,851 --> 00:11:54,340
Tara Harvey Weinstein came to see you.
Um,

297
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,230
he's here,
you need to come back and talk to him.

298
00:11:56,231 --> 00:11:57,850
And I was like,
I was like already at the Improv are

299
00:11:57,851 --> 00:11:58,750
already like,
whatever.

300
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:01,120
And I was like,
I don't want to go.

301
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:04,000
And then the only reason I did not go
back at first,

302
00:12:04,001 --> 00:12:06,250
I was like,
fuck him for just like summoning me to

303
00:12:06,251 --> 00:12:09,790
come back.
I'm making $22 at the comedy store.

304
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:10,653
Like,
I don't,

305
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,580
you know,
and uh,

306
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:14,980
I'd already took me 40 minutes to get
out of the comedy store parking lot.

307
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,990
I can't go back in there.
And,

308
00:12:16,991 --> 00:12:19,060
uh,
I remember literally just being like the

309
00:12:19,061 --> 00:12:21,610
lighting in there as bad.
I don't want him to see me.

310
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:28,030
The lighting on stage is great.
Like he saw me at my best and I really

311
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,320
don't want to go back and like talk to
him.

312
00:12:29,321 --> 00:12:31,270
I don't like know how to do small talk
with the producers.

313
00:12:31,271 --> 00:12:31,781
I'm not,
you know,

314
00:12:31,781 --> 00:12:32,980
me,
I'm like a neurotic mess.

315
00:12:32,981 --> 00:12:35,740
Like I'm not good at like charming and
whatever.

316
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,030
Um,
but yeah,

317
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,940
that's a crazy way to think of things.
There was perfect.

318
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:43,290
Yeah,
that's a disaster.

319
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,340
Like you saw me at my best,
like,

320
00:12:45,341 --> 00:12:46,990
let me just get the fuck outta here.
But like,

321
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:50,560
I didn't know how bad it was,
but I,

322
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,060
you know,
it's like the kind of thing that it's

323
00:12:52,061 --> 00:12:53,150
like we didn't know what we didn't know.

324
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:55,170
Feel a little guilty though.
Like what you're saying,

325
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,400
what I'm getting is that you've people
saying that to you,

326
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:58,470
that you feel like,
ah,

327
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,490
I didn't do it.
I didn't,

328
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:01,423
I'm not

329
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,270
totally,
I think that there's a lot of women that

330
00:13:03,271 --> 00:13:05,970
kind of have done nothing wrong,
but we're consumed with guilt and shame.

331
00:13:05,971 --> 00:13:06,920
Like,
Oh yeah,

332
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:09,810
I,
I'm so glad to hear you say that cause

333
00:13:09,811 --> 00:13:12,540
I'm just not hearing a lot of that.
I'm not hearing a lot of empathy and

334
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,640
maybe I'm just like zoning in on
negative comments.

335
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:17,790
Never had a female employee and I'd
never worked in an office.

336
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:22,730
But even though you hear all this sexual
harassment shit and any ego,

337
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:23,940
did I do anything?
Yeah,

338
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:26,340
you gotta you gotta check.
It seems like everybody did something,

339
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,360
but it's like,
but we were the same way.

340
00:13:28,361 --> 00:13:30,280
It's like,
I mean I remember working on a talk show

341
00:13:30,281 --> 00:13:32,020
and everyone's like,
oh well does that count?

342
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,960
That's not as bad as like getting
granular about it.

343
00:13:34,961 --> 00:13:36,820
Like I remember I worked on a,
um,

344
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,860
a talk show,
late night talk show and a guy came up

345
00:13:38,861 --> 00:13:42,700
to me in front of like a couple of the
writers and he took his hand and like

346
00:13:42,701 --> 00:13:45,910
put it between my butt cheeks and just
went like swiped.

347
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:48,310
And he was,
looks like a credit card machine and

348
00:13:48,311 --> 00:13:50,950
like everybody started laughing.
And of course I started laughing cause I

349
00:13:50,951 --> 00:13:54,790
didn't like froze and I was embarrassed.
No,

350
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,010
he was like my coworker,
like,

351
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,320
you know,
and it was just kind of a Dick comedy

352
00:13:59,321 --> 00:14:00,940
writer and I was like,
what do I do?

353
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:03,730
What am I going to do?
I mean at the time I had no concept that

354
00:14:03,731 --> 00:14:06,140
it was offensive.
I was emotionally so naaman unconscious

355
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,650
in my twenties like I didn't even think
to do anything about it.

356
00:14:08,651 --> 00:14:09,610
But looking back,
I'm like,

357
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,760
that was fucked up.
But what was I going to call human

358
00:14:12,761 --> 00:14:16,900
resources and say that it just,
there's all these little tiny things

359
00:14:16,901 --> 00:14:20,170
that aren't enough to be assault but are
too much to be appropriate.

360
00:14:20,171 --> 00:14:22,630
And it's just like a gray area that I
don't,

361
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,340
you know,
it's,

362
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:27,360
it's hard for us to,
to delineate what makes sense of it.

363
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,260
Well it's funny how cautious you are
now.

364
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:32,170
I mean we're good friends,
but we're joking around when we had

365
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:34,430
these uh,
hoverboards and we're rolling around

366
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:37,690
these and you would not have caught me
cause you didn't want to touch me.

367
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:42,430
That's my fear.
But which you said was hilarious.

368
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:45,490
You,
you were under to say something about,

369
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:50,560
but you weren't sure if you could talk
about it because you were worried that

370
00:14:50,561 --> 00:14:52,190
you bringing up the porn.

371
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,990
Yeah,
but somehow or another be sexually

372
00:14:53,991 --> 00:14:55,790
harassing and I had to say like,
Hey,

373
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:58,010
that doesn't work.
You can't do that to matt.

374
00:14:58,011 --> 00:14:59,420
Like you say,
whatever the fuck you want.

375
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,770
I ever give you license right now
publicly say whatever the fuck you want.

376
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:05,550
Forever.
Can't sexually harass me.

377
00:15:05,551 --> 00:15:06,710
I didn't feel it too.
Like,

378
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,760
you know,
I don't want to,

379
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:12,710
you don't feel like,
I don't want to be a hypocrite.

380
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:15,740
You know?
I've been coming back to the comedy

381
00:15:15,741 --> 00:15:17,660
store a lot and I hadn't been there in
the last like six months.

382
00:15:17,661 --> 00:15:20,190
I've been working on something and I
noticed when I used to go to the comedy

383
00:15:20,191 --> 00:15:22,040
store,
I used to feel like pray or any company

384
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:23,060
club.
It was like,

385
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:26,210
you know,
people would hug you too long and you

386
00:15:26,211 --> 00:15:28,220
know,
you were just waiting to kind of like

387
00:15:28,221 --> 00:15:29,600
have something inappropriate happened.

388
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,330
I went in the other night,
not one man hugged me.

389
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:38,730
Coloma lady like bowing at me.
No one would come near me like I was a

390
00:15:39,621 --> 00:15:42,560
fucking leper.
Donnell Rawlings came up to me and gave

391
00:15:42,561 --> 00:15:43,700
me a hug and halfway through he was
like,

392
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,870
Oh God,
I'm so sorry.

393
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:46,310
Am I allowed to do that?
And it was just like,

394
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,930
oh Whoa,
like this is,

395
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,420
this is fucking crazy.
The tables have turned because it used

396
00:15:50,421 --> 00:15:54,290
to be women who are terrified of men and
now men are kind of terrified or you're

397
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,600
afraid of being called out.
There's a lot of that.

398
00:15:56,601 --> 00:16:00,680
And a lot of guys going over the grade.
If you don't have skeletons in your

399
00:16:00,681 --> 00:16:02,420
closet though,
if you're afraid,

400
00:16:02,421 --> 00:16:03,710
if you don't,
if you don't,

401
00:16:03,711 --> 00:16:06,320
are you afraid?
Because you know you have some shit.

402
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:07,160
Well,
here's the thing,

403
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,960
you don't have to have skeletons in your
closet.

404
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:11,090
Sure.
You can just have a bad relationship

405
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,740
where someone's mad at you.
Like,

406
00:16:12,741 --> 00:16:14,750
this is these and sorry thing,
it's very bizarre.

407
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:19,610
Like this seems like he went on a bad
date and they took turns eating each

408
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:23,210
other out and blown each other and then
she didn't like it and she said that

409
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:25,340
there was like,
I don't know what the fuck happened

410
00:16:25,341 --> 00:16:28,430
cause I wasn't there.
But there's a lot of people that are

411
00:16:28,431 --> 00:16:32,750
picking sides on this and here's,
and I'm not accusing or supporting

412
00:16:32,751 --> 00:16:34,880
either side cause I don't think there's
enough information yet.

413
00:16:34,881 --> 00:16:36,950
And it all seems very like he had one
experience,

414
00:16:36,951 --> 00:16:39,200
she had one experience and if they're
both telling the truth,

415
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,370
you know,
who fucking knows.

416
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:44,090
But here's what I'll say,
just about my experience in my twenties

417
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:49,120
as a woman is I was not fully formed yet
at 22 years old.

418
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:52,370
I didn't know.
I had literally no sex.

419
00:16:52,371 --> 00:16:55,400
I wanted to have in my twenties I didn't
want to have you understand that now

420
00:16:55,401 --> 00:16:58,410
that the frontal lobe is not really
fully formed and human being cracked,

421
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:00,740
cracked.
So Hey guys in your thirties and forties

422
00:17:00,741 --> 00:17:03,020
stopped dating 20 year olds.
Just in general.

423
00:17:03,021 --> 00:17:04,820
It's just a bad idea.
You know,

424
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,880
and I think that a really big part of
the conversation that for me a blind

425
00:17:10,131 --> 00:17:10,964
spot is,
um,

426
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,740
sexual abuse victims.
So the statistics are a little foggy,

427
00:17:15,741 --> 00:17:19,940
but like one out of six women are
sexually assaulted as children and those

428
00:17:19,941 --> 00:17:23,690
are only the people that come forward is
that real one on a six one out of six

429
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,380
is,
is,

430
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:27,320
is the statistic for people that come
forward that's not even including the

431
00:17:27,321 --> 00:17:29,330
people that don't come forward,
which is a lot,

432
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,680
which,
um,

433
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:33,260
and not to get too serious,
but she didn't fucking Olympia,

434
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:35,720
I'm sorry to interrupt you,
but you see that Olympic thing makes me,

435
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,790
it makes me crazy.
The Olympic thing is insane.

436
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:41,270
The Olympic gymnastics coach or doctor
rather that was molesting all those

437
00:17:41,271 --> 00:17:43,520
girls,
it makes me homicidal.

438
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:46,610
And when they're doing the testimony,
the girls that he's saying that this is

439
00:17:46,611 --> 00:17:49,220
too uncomfortable for him to listen to
these girls

440
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,900
saw that guy on the street.
I think I'd kill him,

441
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:53,130
but my hands,
I'd have to,

442
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:54,960
I would go,
I would go batshit crazy.

443
00:17:54,961 --> 00:17:56,080
So,
um,

444
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:59,070
I don't talk about this publicly because
I'm too embarrassed.

445
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,410
That's the other thing about this,
I think that guys,

446
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:06,630
some guys have this idea that us being
sexually harassed is like fun for us and

447
00:18:06,631 --> 00:18:09,210
we like want to come forward and there's
some glory in it.

448
00:18:09,211 --> 00:18:12,030
It's embarrassing and it's awful.
And I don't talk about my sexual

449
00:18:12,031 --> 00:18:12,910
assault,
um,

450
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:14,900
publicly cause I just like freeze up.
Can

451
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:20,040
you're very self aware there are people
that take some sort of glory in being

452
00:18:20,561 --> 00:18:21,394
victimized.

453
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,580
Maybe I can't,
I can't speak to that.

454
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:28,870
But I mean by that is to the point where
they will exaggerate any sort of

455
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:33,610
interaction with someone.
So there's people but men and women,

456
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:34,970
I,
so here's what I'll say,

457
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:37,850
that that could be true.
I don't know enough about the science of

458
00:18:37,851 --> 00:18:38,684
that.
Um,

459
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:41,300
and I'm not a psychiatrist,
but my experience was the opposite.

460
00:18:41,301 --> 00:18:43,820
I minimize mine.
I didn't how most people do.

461
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,830
I didn't come to terms.
The fact that I was sexual assault until

462
00:18:45,831 --> 00:18:47,240
I was 32,
I'm 35.

463
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:49,220
Like I just kind of figured this shit
out.

464
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:52,430
And there's a lot of stuff that is still
blind spots that I don't want to deal

465
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:53,540
with.
And,

466
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:55,640
uh,
and I was only able to write about in my

467
00:18:55,641 --> 00:18:57,890
book because I just,
I can't talk about it publicly.

468
00:18:57,891 --> 00:19:01,460
Like I freeze up,
I get weird and scared and one of the

469
00:19:01,461 --> 00:19:04,940
trauma responses of if you've been
sexually assaulted as a child is that

470
00:19:04,941 --> 00:19:08,570
when the man moves towards you or you
have any kind of sexual,

471
00:19:08,571 --> 00:19:09,590
see,
I'm like getting all nervous.

472
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,040
When you have a sexual interaction,
you freeze up because when you were

473
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:16,160
sexually assaulted as a child,
it didn't serve you to fight back and

474
00:19:16,161 --> 00:19:17,540
you had to kind of disassociate.

475
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,670
That's why people get confused with it.
Fight or flight.

476
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,840
It's not just fight or flight free
trees.

477
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,470
One,
I have a freeze response or I'm sorry,

478
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:28,090
clear about what I'm saying.
So nobody misconstrues this what I'm

479
00:19:28,091 --> 00:19:30,340
saying?
I'm not talking about real

480
00:19:30,341 --> 00:19:34,210
victimization.
I'm talking about people that love to

481
00:19:34,211 --> 00:19:35,420
play the victim.
Sure.

482
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,580
There are a lot of people that,
I don't know.

483
00:19:36,581 --> 00:19:40,000
I'm talking about real vic.
When I say that is people take glory and

484
00:19:40,001 --> 00:19:42,280
victimization.
I don't mean someone who's actually been

485
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:43,570
sexually assaulted.
I mean,

486
00:19:43,571 --> 00:19:46,930
someone who may have had a weird
interaction with a person when they said

487
00:19:46,931 --> 00:19:47,620
something.
Yeah.

488
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,200
And by the way,
I've done that,

489
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:49,980
like,
um,

490
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,990
you know,
I get bumped at the comedy store and I'm

491
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:54,960
like,
can you fucking believe I got bumped?

492
00:19:54,961 --> 00:19:57,510
It's like I just am getting adrenaline
and,

493
00:19:57,511 --> 00:20:01,290
and dopamine from like being self
righteous or having been wrong or

494
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:01,810
something.
I,

495
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:04,110
I know what you mean from that
perspective,

496
00:20:04,111 --> 00:20:05,940
but I think when it's something real,
yeah.

497
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,430
My reaction is to complete as he is a
big one.

498
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,333
Yeah.
So it's like

499
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:13,170
so big one with a salt.
If people get,

500
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,580
not just sexual things,
but physical assault,

501
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,240
a lot of,
one of the things that happens to be

502
00:20:17,241 --> 00:20:20,890
when they're confronted by someone in a
dangerous situations that panic and they

503
00:20:20,891 --> 00:20:22,360
freeze,
they don't do anything.

504
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:23,050
They don't,
they can't,

505
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:24,040
they literally can't move.

506
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:28,400
So if at least 20% of women have that,
who knows what the fuck is going on in

507
00:20:28,401 --> 00:20:30,140
some of these interactions.
So for me,

508
00:20:30,141 --> 00:20:31,970
like in my twenties when a guy came
towards me,

509
00:20:31,971 --> 00:20:33,460
I would freak out.
And people go,

510
00:20:33,461 --> 00:20:35,060
why didn't they say no?
Why didn't they leave?

511
00:20:35,061 --> 00:20:37,270
Cause I'm fucking frozen and I don't
know what to do.

512
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:37,930
So

513
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:41,320
is that has never been involved in any
sort of real altercation when they were

514
00:20:41,321 --> 00:20:42,210
in danger?
Anyone?

515
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:43,690
He says,
why didn't you just,

516
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:45,910
well you don't know why you didn't do
things.

517
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:48,130
But there's times my life when I look
back,

518
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:49,630
I'm like,
why didn't I fucking say something?

519
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:50,493
Yeah,
but why?

520
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,940
Why didn't I tell that guy to fuck off
or what?

521
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:54,420
You don't know what to do sometimes.

522
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:56,240
I mean that was me and my whole
twenties.

523
00:20:56,241 --> 00:20:57,230
Why didn't I tell him?
No,

524
00:20:57,231 --> 00:20:59,240
why didn't I leave?
Why didn't I tell him to stop?

525
00:20:59,241 --> 00:21:00,380
Like you know,
so,

526
00:21:00,381 --> 00:21:03,770
so a lot of it I didn't even understand
cause I was too young too.

527
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:05,180
And I also,
I didn't,

528
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:10,390
it took me 58 years of a 12 step program
and therapy and Emdr to even be able to

529
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,250
save Emdr,
eye movement,

530
00:21:13,251 --> 00:21:16,460
reprogramming and desensitization.
How the fuck would you expect anyone to

531
00:21:16,461 --> 00:21:18,290
know what that means,
where you could just use

532
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:24,620
your fans are so fucking smart and like
there's such neurology nerds.

533
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,180
Yeah,
but that's off the deep end.

534
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:29,360
You will,
I need in my life it's uh,

535
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:31,100
uh,
post traumatic stress disorder or a

536
00:21:31,101 --> 00:21:31,990
therapy.
Uh,

537
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,370
it was started for um,
uh,

538
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:37,850
Vietnam vets and it helps you to sort of
deactivate traumatic experiences.

539
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,890
Have you ever done ecstasy?
No.

540
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,140
Yeah,
it'll be,

541
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,610
therapy is supposed to be amazing for
people that have gone through trauma or

542
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:45,630
been told about this.
Yeah.

543
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,630
I'm going to go to Coachella next year
and try that.

544
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:51,130
I don't know if that's the place,
but it's supposed to be amazing for

545
00:21:51,131 --> 00:21:54,730
people that have gone through real
traumatic experiences that are so

546
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:57,880
ingrained in their mind.
Like the memories of those experiences

547
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:02,950
are ingrained with trauma and horrible
feelings and somehow or another MDM may

548
00:22:02,951 --> 00:22:05,510
therapy allows people to separate from
that and,

549
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:09,670
and lose the trigger and like lose,
lose this,

550
00:22:09,671 --> 00:22:09,990
this right.

551
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:14,430
Sounds like a way more fun way to do it
because Emdr is like you sort of have to

552
00:22:14,431 --> 00:22:18,510
relive the memory and then other shit
gets on earth and things start clicking

553
00:22:18,511 --> 00:22:19,200
into focus.

554
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,940
Well,
the reason why they call it ecstasies

555
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,470
cause that's literally what you feel.
You feel so much love and what,

556
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,140
what his brain with dopamine.
Yes.

557
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:31,020
And I only did it once,
but the thing that stunned me was how

558
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,890
comparatively insecure I am in regular
life.

559
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:37,400
Comparatively insecure.
Can you say that again?

560
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,300
Comparatively insecure compared to when
you're on ecstasy.

561
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:42,160
Oh No.
Inhibition.

562
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:46,920
Zero.
You're so friendly and so warm and so I

563
00:22:46,921 --> 00:22:47,840
try to be,
yeah.

564
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,560
Yeah.
But when your,

565
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:52,830
when you're on ecstasy you really
realize like all the hitches in your

566
00:22:52,831 --> 00:22:54,570
personality or things that are holding
you back.

567
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:56,220
It made me,
I only did it once,

568
00:22:56,370 --> 00:23:00,030
but it made me completely aware of
insecurity that I didn't even know

569
00:23:00,031 --> 00:23:01,350
existed.
Fascinating.

570
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,880
Yeah,
let's do that.

571
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:03,751
Yeah,
you do it.

572
00:23:03,751 --> 00:23:05,430
You'd trip out.
It's very interesting.

573
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:05,910
Super

574
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:07,410
into it.
I had another friend,

575
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:09,330
um,
recommend that and I'd be down because

576
00:23:09,331 --> 00:23:10,980
it's also like,
you know,

577
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:13,290
and something else I'll say not to speak
for all women,

578
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:16,530
like I'm not the face of all women,
but like with this administration,

579
00:23:16,531 --> 00:23:20,910
if you're a sexual trauma survivors
seeing this fucking guy on the news

580
00:23:20,911 --> 00:23:25,160
every day can be really triggering post
about the women's march is twitter

581
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:30,000
literally can't read the news anymore
because I'm too activated and I'm just,

582
00:23:30,001 --> 00:23:30,690
I'm,
I'm,

583
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:33,080
I'm going crazy.
I'm way to activate it.

584
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:37,500
Like seeing a sexual Predator or someone
I deemed to be a sexual Predator with

585
00:23:37,501 --> 00:23:40,350
all the women that have come forward in
the news every day is activating my

586
00:23:40,351 --> 00:23:43,110
trauma response of,
I think he's a predator.

587
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:46,150
I don't think it's just sexual.
I think he's a Predator

588
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:49,040
and our business,
I think he's a Predator politics.

589
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:51,320
I think he's,
I mean if you look at the way he

590
00:23:51,321 --> 00:23:52,490
campaigned,
you know,

591
00:23:52,491 --> 00:23:54,620
like about the Hillary Clinton,
lock her up,

592
00:23:54,621 --> 00:23:57,280
lock her up.
This is predatory fines.

593
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,640
Yeah.
Well he,

594
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,380
he's a,
he's a fucking winner.

595
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,830
I hate to say it that way.
And I was,

596
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,870
do you remember?
Um,

597
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,080
I think it was,
I don't know if this was the primaries

598
00:24:06,081 --> 00:24:09,890
or it was like when Ben Carson was still
in the mix and they were all lined up

599
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:12,710
and I remember seeing,
and this was when we all thought it was

600
00:24:12,711 --> 00:24:14,870
like a joke and he called all of them
out.

601
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,880
He was like,
you've asked me for money and you've

602
00:24:16,881 --> 00:24:18,980
asked me for money and you've asked me
for money.

603
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:21,050
And I was like,
that's fucking hot.

604
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,720
Like this.
The reptilian brain was like,

605
00:24:23,721 --> 00:24:26,420
oh shit.
Like that guy's a fucking winner and

606
00:24:26,421 --> 00:24:27,860
he's not scared of anything.

607
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:30,820
And with the sound off,
I'm like,

608
00:24:30,821 --> 00:24:32,320
that's the alpha.
If Shit hits the fan,

609
00:24:32,321 --> 00:24:35,690
I'm following that guy's old.
He's lived a long life.

610
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:37,950
He's on speed.
He's a malignant narcissist.

611
00:24:37,951 --> 00:24:40,610
The money.
And there's all these reports that he's

612
00:24:40,611 --> 00:24:42,530
on diet pills.
Do you believe that syphilis,

613
00:24:42,531 --> 00:24:44,660
Siri,
I don't know that when you have,

614
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:48,640
can you look this up as if you haven't
already today though?

615
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:52,250
No.
Is that like caffeine or is it like he's

616
00:24:52,251 --> 00:24:55,520
on some sort of amphetamines?
Apparently according to several sources.

617
00:24:55,790 --> 00:25:00,590
One of them that tracked his
prescription from drain read pharmacy in

618
00:25:00,591 --> 00:25:05,591
New York from a few years back that he
was on this one type of amphetamine for

619
00:25:05,751 --> 00:25:07,850
like eight years to take drug tests.
If you're the president,

620
00:25:07,851 --> 00:25:09,500
and I don't even know,
wow,

621
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:12,740
this is amazing.
You have to take a drug test.

622
00:25:12,741 --> 00:25:16,790
You work for ups,
you don't have to take a breath test if

623
00:25:16,791 --> 00:25:18,410
you have the fucking nuclear football.

624
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,430
How is that not?
Well,

625
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:22,640
I dunno.
It doesn't mean while Jeff sessions is

626
00:25:22,641 --> 00:25:26,140
fucking trying to take pot away from
everybody and Donald Trump's popping

627
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:27,440
pills,
I don't know if he's really popping

628
00:25:27,441 --> 00:25:28,940
pills.
I should say this,

629
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:32,060
but what I've read is that what he's
taking,

630
00:25:32,061 --> 00:25:36,140
what they believe he's taking his,
do you remember phen phen phen phen was

631
00:25:36,141 --> 00:25:40,490
some shit that went,
went on in the 90s it was a diet pill

632
00:25:40,491 --> 00:25:43,820
that they had to stop taking because it
was a super effective for people,

633
00:25:43,821 --> 00:25:46,650
but it was essentially speed.
They lost her appetite and he stepped

634
00:25:46,651 --> 00:25:49,850
back and everybody lost weight.
Do you remember that Diet pill?

635
00:25:49,851 --> 00:25:52,830
I took that like when I was in high
school and had an eating disorder that's

636
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,740
similar.
There's all these things are similar

637
00:25:54,741 --> 00:25:56,480
because they're amphetamines,
they're speed,

638
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,493
they're all,
they're all,

639
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:02,740
they're all stimulants and there's one
of the ingredients in phen phen when the

640
00:26:03,891 --> 00:26:05,300
two of them are combined together.

641
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:08,750
Phen phen is two different things and
see if he could find that story about

642
00:26:08,751 --> 00:26:12,560
what they think that he's on.
It gives you delusions of glory of grand

643
00:26:12,561 --> 00:26:13,520
jury.
That's the thing,

644
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,700
like literally one of the symptoms.
First of all,

645
00:26:16,701 --> 00:26:19,460
think about the amount of energy this
guy had running for president giving

646
00:26:19,461 --> 00:26:21,710
these longs teachers never seem tired.
Yeah.

647
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,980
Dot.
Rumer Donald doctor prescribed Donald

648
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:25,820
Trump.
Cheap speed.

649
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:27,570
Fucking fixer.
That bitch.

650
00:26:27,571 --> 00:26:30,320
She's amazing.
Who made that picture?

651
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,130
Who's Jim?
Jim Cook.

652
00:26:34,131 --> 00:26:35,780
Jim Cook.
You're a fucking wizard.

653
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:39,390
Whoever you are,
his neck looks like a fucking elephant.

654
00:26:39,391 --> 00:26:41,120
Applause.
That made me laugh hard.

655
00:26:41,121 --> 00:26:43,760
The orange is perfect.
It's like such an exact,

656
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:44,160
but just

657
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,620
exaggerate.
Just enough the eyes.

658
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:48,300
Okay,
you're enjoying this.

659
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:51,930
He looks like your rock salt lamp.
Got to be able to laugh while this is

660
00:26:51,931 --> 00:26:54,270
going on and you can't,
you can't freak out.

661
00:26:54,271 --> 00:26:57,300
Okay.
Rumors of trump's a predilection.

662
00:26:57,330 --> 00:27:00,270
I love that word.
Predilection for stimulants first

663
00:27:00,271 --> 00:27:03,210
started really popping up in 1992 in spy
magazine road.

664
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:06,180
You ever wonder why Donald Trump has
acted so radically at times full of

665
00:27:06,181 --> 00:27:08,460
energy of manic energy,
paranoia and,

666
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:11,010
wow,
what does that word Garul lists

667
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,350
careless.
Darryl,

668
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,070
you ever use that Word Darryl?
This is like,

669
00:27:14,071 --> 00:27:15,870
I thought like cheerful,
like garrulous.

670
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,250
Hmm.
Well your speed it up.

671
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,620
Well,
he was a patient of Dr. Joseph

672
00:27:19,621 --> 00:27:22,680
Greenberg's from 1982 to 1985 at the
time,

673
00:27:22,681 --> 00:27:26,100
Doctor Greenberg was notorious for
allegedly dolling out prescription

674
00:27:26,101 --> 00:27:28,370
stimulants to anyone who would pay blah,
blah,

675
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:28,700
blah,
blah,

676
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:32,160
blah diet drugs,
which trump took a pill form and try it

677
00:27:32,161 --> 00:27:35,460
drugs and also be fat because he's
eating a lot of terrible things.

678
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,330
Oh,
okay.

679
00:27:36,331 --> 00:27:37,330
This is the stuff.
Okay.

680
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:38,940
Okay.
Fen Phen,

681
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:43,970
it's called fin turn.
Rameen first gain notoriety in the U s

682
00:27:44,731 --> 00:27:49,731
under the name phen phen a miracle
combination of phentermine and

683
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:53,530
fenfluramine another establish anti
obesity drugs.

684
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:55,740
The two of them together.
The only problem was with the patients

685
00:27:55,741 --> 00:27:59,670
taking the drug began reporting damage
to their hearts and lungs.

686
00:27:59,671 --> 00:28:02,760
Apparently the combination destroy the
patient's bodies,

687
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:07,080
so he's not taking both of them.
He's taking one phentermine mean on its

688
00:28:07,081 --> 00:28:07,771
own.
However,

689
00:28:07,771 --> 00:28:08,670
it's still prescribed.

690
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:10,580
Trouble with thinking,
speaking or walking,

691
00:28:10,581 --> 00:28:13,900
decreased stability at exercise,
false or unusual sense of wellbeing,

692
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:14,960
insomnia,
nervousness.

693
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,900
And this is my suicide note.
Increase in sexual ability,

694
00:28:17,901 --> 00:28:22,050
desire drive,
not true confusion.

695
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:24,170
Sure.
I mean,

696
00:28:24,171 --> 00:28:26,440
so this is,
this is doctor prescribed?

697
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,980
Yes.
This is what I think.

698
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:30,800
Why wouldn't you just take out all,
well that's a good one.

699
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,810
Yeah,
but it's the same thing we bought

700
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:37,100
adderalls syphilis theory.
Trump adderall is essentially like

701
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:39,860
incredibly similar.
There it is a medical fear.

702
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:43,790
Many mental health professionals believe
the president is ill,

703
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,160
but one of the causes and untreated std,

704
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:51,310
apparently syphilis untreated
creates like,

705
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:56,360
like reddening of the face,
manic behavior,

706
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:57,171
uh,
the greater,

707
00:28:57,171 --> 00:28:58,940
but I can't read this.
This face is Pale.

708
00:28:58,941 --> 00:29:00,700
It's orange skin color.
Oh,

709
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:02,170
is that self tanner?
Yeah.

710
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:04,010
If you look at his eyes,
syphilis,

711
00:29:04,011 --> 00:29:06,050
why his eyes are white like all around
his eyes,

712
00:29:06,051 --> 00:29:08,160
like a raccoon.
There were white care.

713
00:29:08,161 --> 00:29:09,920
Okay.
It's characterized by the development of

714
00:29:09,921 --> 00:29:12,530
an ulcer.
Usually genital a few weeks in a few

715
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:14,600
months after sexual contact with an
infected person.

716
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,730
If the is not,
notice,

717
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:20,740
not a secondary stage of the disease is
seen in some patients weeks or months

718
00:29:20,991 --> 00:29:22,430
later.
These patients may develop variety.

719
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,520
Thank you.
Have you,

720
00:29:23,521 --> 00:29:27,860
you're leaning.
You're so upset cause I can't see

721
00:29:27,861 --> 00:29:29,990
rajshree right.
I want to get to the um,

722
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,590
right behind you too.
Oh.

723
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,510
Can't swivel.
I hurt my back.

724
00:29:34,511 --> 00:29:37,270
I told you that I hurt my back on your
fucking segue.

725
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,580
Shine.
Impress you.

726
00:29:39,581 --> 00:29:41,650
I'm suing you.
Did following you.

727
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:44,110
We have video cameras everywhere in this
place.

728
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:47,470
Do you know how to use a bow and Arrow?
I'm not suing you.

729
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:52,970
Psychiatric disorder.
Neurosyphilis symptoms or neurosyphilis

730
00:29:52,971 --> 00:29:55,340
or proteus.
Proteus changing.

731
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:57,640
Varying widely from one individual to
another.

732
00:29:57,641 --> 00:29:57,750
Yeah.

733
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:59,850
Irritability,
loss of ability to concentrate.

734
00:29:59,851 --> 00:30:02,370
Delusional thinking and grandiosity.
Memory.

735
00:30:02,371 --> 00:30:05,550
Insight and judgment can become impaired
and he's got everything in there duking

736
00:30:05,551 --> 00:30:07,860
it out inside of [inaudible] in the
fucking eighties,

737
00:30:07,861 --> 00:30:12,780
from stormy Brown or whatever.
And now he's fucking got delusional

738
00:30:12,781 --> 00:30:17,490
thinking and grandiosity.
It's stormy brown hair loss.

739
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:21,280
And then it also makes your hair like
fluffy and just exactly what you said,

740
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:24,180
fucking 90 years old,
you're going to lose your hair.

741
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:28,470
Uh,
there's like a history of Israel and all

742
00:30:28,471 --> 00:30:33,140
those girls,
females.

743
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:35,760
Um,
anyway,

744
00:30:35,761 --> 00:30:39,210
so I mean you can see why we're all a
little triggered.

745
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:40,350
Yeah.
But I don't think,

746
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,240
I think that people are reaching for
straws.

747
00:30:42,241 --> 00:30:44,400
I mean he just got,
that was interesting.

748
00:30:44,401 --> 00:30:48,120
The doctor that examined him,
examined him and said that he probably,

749
00:30:48,121 --> 00:30:50,250
if he had a good diet,
he lived to be like 200 years old.

750
00:30:50,251 --> 00:30:51,450
These couches,
great genes.

751
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,550
That doctor that examined him,
I was like,

752
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:57,140
this is this doctor's doctor.
The guy that killed Michael Jackson is

753
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:59,430
his doctor.
But here's the thing.

754
00:30:59,431 --> 00:31:02,790
After he did that,
then Sanjay Gupta examine the actual

755
00:31:02,791 --> 00:31:05,340
results and Sanjay Gupta said,
well,

756
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:06,990
no,
there's actually an issue here.

757
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:12,260
And the issue is something to do with
arteries and something to do with the

758
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:17,950
potential for a future stroke or heart
attack and he was going on.

759
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,680
He was basing it on actual test results
and obviously I don't know Jack Shit

760
00:31:22,681 --> 00:31:24,510
about medicine,
but see if you could find out what he

761
00:31:24,511 --> 00:31:27,030
said.
He's a common form of heart disease.

762
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:29,570
Yeah.
See a scroll up and see if you could

763
00:31:29,571 --> 00:31:31,170
find what it said there.

764
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:34,380
Yeah.
Here it is.

765
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:37,230
This is what it is.
Doctor Ronnie Jackson disclosed trump's

766
00:31:37,231 --> 00:31:39,090
basic lab measurements,
physical exam,

767
00:31:39,091 --> 00:31:43,530
and the conclusion of a cognitive exam
known as the Montreal cognitive

768
00:31:43,531 --> 00:31:44,820
assessment.
Additionally,

769
00:31:44,821 --> 00:31:48,960
the president had an echo cardiogram of
his heart as well as the stress test.

770
00:31:48,961 --> 00:31:51,210
Both scrubs is normal,
although is not a part of the official

771
00:31:51,211 --> 00:31:53,760
medical records that were released
yesterday.

772
00:31:53,761 --> 00:31:57,510
After further questioning,
Jackson also reveal the trump underwent

773
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:00,570
coronary calcium ct scan.
Now this is it.

774
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:05,780
His score was one 33 in anything over a
hundred indicates plaque is present at

775
00:32:05,821 --> 00:32:10,050
the patient has heart disease.
According to trump's official records in

776
00:32:10,051 --> 00:32:13,740
2009 his coronary calcium score was 34.

777
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,360
Does the president have an obligation to
be in shape?

778
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:19,240
I mean,
wasn't Robert Taft like notoriously

779
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,880
obese?
Like do you have to be in shape to be

780
00:32:21,881 --> 00:32:23,080
the president?
I don't know the answer.

781
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,430
That's a good question.
Like,

782
00:32:24,431 --> 00:32:26,860
do you,
are there certain boxes you have to

783
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:27,410
check?
Okay.

784
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:32,410
What I'm getting out of this is it's
Sanjay Gupta who is an unconnected third

785
00:32:32,511 --> 00:32:37,160
party who's unbiased,
is going basically just offered these

786
00:32:37,161 --> 00:32:40,220
coronary calcium ct.
And

787
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:45,220
what he's showing is the difference
between how it was in 2009 which was 34

788
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:51,270
2013 which is 98 and then 2018 which is
one 33.

789
00:32:51,271 --> 00:32:52,580
You're saying it's increased?
Yes.

790
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:55,040
Basically doubled every,
it's bad.

791
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,740
Couple of years is bad.
Everything over 100 indicates heart

792
00:32:57,741 --> 00:32:59,750
disease.
I'm not going to say anything else bad.

793
00:32:59,751 --> 00:33:03,050
I'm worried I'll get death threats.
We worry that you want him to get this.

794
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:03,741
No,
I just,

795
00:33:03,741 --> 00:33:04,491
I,
I just,

796
00:33:04,491 --> 00:33:08,960
you know,
no one's on millions of fucking people.

797
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:10,370
Um,
you know,

798
00:33:10,371 --> 00:33:12,710
but I think that's the other thing.
I think we're all sort of just,

799
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:16,550
just especially angry.
Like when you were talking about the

800
00:33:16,551 --> 00:33:20,930
pendulum swinging so hard of of women.
It's like having to see this constantly,

801
00:33:20,931 --> 00:33:22,880
everyday in the news.
This guy is,

802
00:33:22,881 --> 00:33:23,840
it's,
it's hard.

803
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:27,260
It's really hard and depressing trying
to be objective.

804
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:31,250
This is what I find fascinating about it
is that obviously this is an aberration.

805
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:32,960
Like no one's ever seen something like
this before.

806
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:38,170
No one's ever seen a president.
There's a video that was on go to the

807
00:33:38,181 --> 00:33:43,181
typical liberal instagram page.
There's a video of him saying no one is

808
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:47,540
better at blank than him.
And it's like a video that was actually

809
00:33:47,541 --> 00:33:52,541
put together by people to mock him.
But the trump supporters actually love

810
00:33:54,561 --> 00:33:55,070
it.
Yeah.

811
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:58,100
Play this because 24 things,
nobody is better at than trump.

812
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:00,140
Nobody can do it like me,
nobody.

813
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:03,980
Nobody can do it.
Like nobody's stronger than me.

814
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:08,360
Nobody has better choice than I do
better at the military than I ain't.

815
00:34:08,361 --> 00:34:11,630
Nobody loves the Bible more than I do.
Nobody builds walls better than me.

816
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:15,250
Nobody's better to people with
disabilities than man.

817
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:17,530
Nobody's fighting for the veterans like
I'm fighting for them.

818
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,800
Nobody that's done so much for equality.

819
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:23,170
There's nobody more pro Israel than I
am.

820
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:27,190
Nobody more conservative than me.
There's nobody that respects women more

821
00:34:27,191 --> 00:34:32,080
than I would be tougher on Isis than
Donald Trump.

822
00:34:32,081 --> 00:34:37,081
Nobody's ever had crowds like trump is
crowds of people

823
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:48,790
and they couldn't corroborate it.
I know what it means.

824
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:53,820
Nobody knows more about trade than me
in the history of this country.

825
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:58,240
Has ever known so much about
infrastructure has Donald Trump?

826
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:00,010
Nobody can do it like me.
Nobody

827
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:02,290
do.

828
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:03,470
You know,
shed do the opposite.

829
00:35:03,471 --> 00:35:03,891
They're like,
look,

830
00:35:03,891 --> 00:35:06,560
I'm not a scientist.
I don't know that much about this.

831
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:09,800
Like are more humble about it.
I wish he wasn't president because I

832
00:35:09,801 --> 00:35:13,250
love him.
I love what a character he is.

833
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,410
He's entertaining.
He's fascinating.

834
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:19,360
That's fascinating.
He has powers the problem.

835
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:22,880
That's the problem.
He's doing horrible to character and as

836
00:35:22,881 --> 00:35:25,970
the host of a reality show,
he's a gem.

837
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,460
I mean,
it's such a free to be on a reality

838
00:35:28,461 --> 00:35:29,300
show.
Great.

839
00:35:29,301 --> 00:35:31,610
Sign me up,
but to be running the most powerful

840
00:35:31,611 --> 00:35:32,630
country in the world,
I don't know,

841
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:36,350
maybe China is now is it's really,
really scary.

842
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:37,620
Well,
it's just fascinating,

843
00:35:37,621 --> 00:35:38,400
the supporters

844
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,860
too.
Like I love reading his support his,

845
00:35:40,861 --> 00:35:42,960
cause I'm always trying to figure out
which ones are Russians.

846
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:44,450
Okay.
How many of these are Russian?

847
00:35:44,451 --> 00:35:44,580
Yeah.

848
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:47,610
A lot of them are women.
There's a few that are women.

849
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,620
Yeah.
But what are those women voted for him?

850
00:35:49,621 --> 00:35:51,340
What's the deal with those girls?
Um,

851
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:52,110
you know,
I,

852
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:56,250
here's what I'll say,
and I have some family who voted for him

853
00:35:56,251 --> 00:35:57,390
who are in,
um,

854
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:58,650
you know,
exile,

855
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:02,130
just working class.
And their whole thing is like,

856
00:36:02,131 --> 00:36:03,450
we don't,
we don't care.

857
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,340
All we care about is the bottom line.
Our jobs.

858
00:36:05,341 --> 00:36:07,510
It's actually kind of a luxury.
Um,

859
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:10,350
and that's,
I think a fair flaw with what's

860
00:36:10,351 --> 00:36:11,470
happening with this.
You know,

861
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:14,850
women's movement conversation is right
now,

862
00:36:14,851 --> 00:36:17,490
the people getting the most visibility
or fucking millionaires,

863
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,860
you know,
that's sort of the,

864
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,730
for the most part,
who's speaking up right now.

865
00:36:20,731 --> 00:36:21,720
And like,
you know,

866
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:25,770
that's what time's up is for to
enfranchise people who don't have the

867
00:36:25,771 --> 00:36:27,330
kind of resources to just be like,
you know what,

868
00:36:27,331 --> 00:36:28,020
you're mistreating me.

869
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,550
I'm going to quit my job.
You know,

870
00:36:29,551 --> 00:36:32,310
a lot of people can't quit their job and
they have to tolerate sexual harassment

871
00:36:32,311 --> 00:36:33,001
and,
and whatever.

872
00:36:33,001 --> 00:36:35,220
And they don't really have a choice in
the matter of they have to stay in bad

873
00:36:35,221 --> 00:36:38,670
relationships because they can't afford
to get their own place or whatever.

874
00:36:38,671 --> 00:36:39,504
But,
um,

875
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:42,060
but all they heard was jobs.
Their thing is like,

876
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,790
we don't care anything about his
character.

877
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:46,830
We think all politicians are assholes.
We just want jobs.

878
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:49,200
And that's what he said.
He was gonna promise and he lied.

879
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:49,830
You know,
I'm,

880
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:52,270
so,
they were just like sort of played well,

881
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,840
isn't there more jobs now than ever
before?

882
00:36:54,841 --> 00:36:57,390
And isn't the unemployment as low as
it's ever been?

883
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,050
But he was,
but he was promised,

884
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,091
I mean,
health insurance,

885
00:37:00,091 --> 00:37:01,620
I think they don't,
they also thought that they were gonna

886
00:37:01,621 --> 00:37:03,330
get this like magical health insurance
reform,

887
00:37:03,331 --> 00:37:05,040
which they didn't get,
but there was also,

888
00:37:05,041 --> 00:37:07,380
um,
he was promising like coal mine jobs,

889
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,720
which is so crazy.
My family members,

890
00:37:09,721 --> 00:37:11,130
like we're going to work in coal mines.
I'm like,

891
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:13,380
really?
So that's 50,000 jobs,

892
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,300
right?
And there it starting to become

893
00:37:15,301 --> 00:37:18,120
obsolete.
So he promised kind of jobs that I think

894
00:37:18,121 --> 00:37:20,490
the pipeline and shit like that.
So I think that,

895
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:22,470
you know,
and they just watch Fox News and they

896
00:37:22,471 --> 00:37:25,710
believe everything that's been,
they think like liberal news is a lie,

897
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:27,780
you know?
So I think it's like the kind of jobs

898
00:37:27,781 --> 00:37:29,370
that they promised.
And I know,

899
00:37:29,371 --> 00:37:30,750
and I think that you're exactly right.
It's like,

900
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:33,540
um,
their whole thing is unemployment going

901
00:37:33,541 --> 00:37:35,760
up is what helps women because more
women can get John.

902
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,020
But isn't it a case where,
when,

903
00:37:38,021 --> 00:37:41,260
when you see like unemployment and how
more people were,

904
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:43,380
uh,
doing better than before and the economy

905
00:37:43,381 --> 00:37:45,020
is doing better than it's ever been
before.

906
00:37:45,021 --> 00:37:47,420
Hey,
isn't this like a natural cycle to like

907
00:37:47,421 --> 00:37:50,060
wasn't it already charting in that
direction when Obama was leaving?

908
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,480
I was going to say,
I think it's the president that's like

909
00:37:52,481 --> 00:37:55,120
four years prior.
That usually is what causes it because

910
00:37:55,121 --> 00:37:57,760
you can't just like become president and
all of a sudden there's more jobs.

911
00:37:57,761 --> 00:37:59,530
That's something that has to start a
little bit earlier.

912
00:37:59,531 --> 00:38:01,000
I'm not saying Obama,
I don't know.

913
00:38:01,001 --> 00:38:01,700
That's about it.

914
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:04,880
When Obama got into office,
everybody was blaming him like right

915
00:38:04,881 --> 00:38:05,150
away,

916
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:07,040
even though that's probably what the
president before him.

917
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:08,030
Sure,
sure.

918
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:09,680
Here it goes.
So let me

919
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,740
gain a net.
Well,

920
00:38:10,741 --> 00:38:14,480
11.5 million jobs,
the unemployment rate dropped below the

921
00:38:14,481 --> 00:38:15,690
historical norm.
Okay.

922
00:38:15,691 --> 00:38:20,330
4% average weekly earnings for all
workers were up 4.1% after inflation.

923
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:25,331
The gain was 3.7% or just production and
nonsupervisory employees after tax

924
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:30,890
corporate profits also set records as
the stock profits.

925
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:35,891
S and p 500 index rose 166%.
There was some story about how the tax

926
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:41,020
break that we got here because of trump
that people got,

927
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:43,970
um,
that California was going to somehow or

928
00:38:43,971 --> 00:38:48,971
another impart some sort of a 10%
surcharge to counterbalance that.

929
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,190
But,
and I was like flat,

930
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,620
but then that they said it was all going
to like,

931
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:55,090
uh,
social programs.

932
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:55,541
I'm like,
well,

933
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:59,950
that's a good thing.
I'm all for paying more taxes if those

934
00:38:59,951 --> 00:39:02,980
taxes can go to poor communities.
That's what I feel like.

935
00:39:02,981 --> 00:39:06,190
I feel like if there's one thing that we
need to concentrate in this country is

936
00:39:06,191 --> 00:39:09,640
people that are disenfranchised and live
in poor communities that don't feel like

937
00:39:09,641 --> 00:39:12,190
there's any hope.
And then setting up community centers,

938
00:39:12,191 --> 00:39:14,770
setting up some,
some education programs,

939
00:39:14,771 --> 00:39:18,340
setting up but safe places where kids
can go and they don't have to worry

940
00:39:18,341 --> 00:39:22,030
about gang violence and shit and just
making it safer for people and giving

941
00:39:22,031 --> 00:39:26,830
them more opportunities to possibly get
out of that fucking horrible cycle of

942
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:28,720
unemployment and,
and,

943
00:39:28,721 --> 00:39:30,880
and fucking welfare and crime.

944
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:33,590
And if so many people are stuck,
and I completely agree.

945
00:39:33,591 --> 00:39:34,970
And when I think about that,
I'm like,

946
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:37,280
oh you know,
and this is just my point of view

947
00:39:37,281 --> 00:39:39,440
because of what I come from and maybe
it's being a woman,

948
00:39:39,441 --> 00:39:40,460
a female brain,
whatever.

949
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:43,940
But like when I hear that I'm like the
thing that perpetuates that cycle is

950
00:39:43,941 --> 00:39:47,690
having kids too soon and having a lack
of access to birth control and education

951
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:50,300
and this administration is a huge threat
to that.

952
00:39:50,301 --> 00:39:52,820
An enemy to that.
So I'm like what brain live?

953
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:54,860
Why?
What depletes you faster than a kid?

954
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:57,560
Was that just a straight up Republican
and pull this thing?

955
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:59,360
I'm so sorry.
I always have this problem.

956
00:39:59,361 --> 00:40:01,760
We don't have it like I always do this.
Why?

957
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:04,050
What does it say about me?
Let me get like a fist.

958
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,350
Do any of your other guests have this
problem?

959
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:07,400
Okay.
Okay good.

960
00:40:07,401 --> 00:40:09,710
Okay.
I used to do it before I did a podcast

961
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:11,870
or radio shows.
It always yell at me cause I wasn't in

962
00:40:11,871 --> 00:40:15,350
the mic.
But why is it thing,

963
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:19,120
it's always a republican thing to try to
deny women birth control to try to

964
00:40:19,121 --> 00:40:20,780
restrict abortion.
This is always right

965
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:24,440
cause I think it probably boils down to
religion and I don't know,

966
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:27,980
I still can't understand why religion is
the reason that people think women have

967
00:40:27,981 --> 00:40:30,590
to be cows.
And if I could have ever for religious,

968
00:40:30,591 --> 00:40:31,850
this is what's so crazy.
Yeah.

969
00:40:31,851 --> 00:40:34,610
Well he used to,
I mean I think a lot of it's kind of

970
00:40:34,611 --> 00:40:37,400
like,
keeps conveniently now super pro life or

971
00:40:37,401 --> 00:40:39,500
something.
Nobody likes the Bible more than I do.

972
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,320
Nobody hates abortion more than me.
I wish I could do,

973
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,190
I can't do an impression.
I was just thinking.

974
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:46,550
You don't,
you don't,

975
00:40:46,551 --> 00:40:47,510
it's chilling.
I don't,

976
00:40:47,511 --> 00:40:48,860
I don't,
I don't want to hear it.

977
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:51,800
Last thing we need is more fucking trump
impressions at the comedy store.

978
00:40:51,801 --> 00:40:52,690
I'm good.
Um,

979
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:54,740
but uh,
the burn has a really good one.

980
00:40:54,741 --> 00:40:56,570
Really?
It's really,

981
00:40:56,571 --> 00:40:59,630
it's really good.
I would not have seen that coming.

982
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:00,830
I didn't see it coming either.

983
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:03,360
He did it the other night and went,
Woo.

984
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,350
He nails it.
That's kind of amazing.

985
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,680
And he nails it.
Yeah.

986
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:09,140
I have to process that later as the
finger thing.

987
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:10,971
That's great.
I mean,

988
00:41:10,971 --> 00:41:12,670
Alec Baldwin's is like fucking just,
yeah.

989
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:14,300
But um,
but yeah,

990
00:41:14,301 --> 00:41:16,990
I think it's religiously sort of based
and uh,

991
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:19,250
and Hubris based.
I mean just the idea that women

992
00:41:19,251 --> 00:41:20,540
shouldn't have control over their own
bodies.

993
00:41:20,541 --> 00:41:22,490
It's just like,
why do you want me to have kids that I'm

994
00:41:22,491 --> 00:41:24,110
not ready for it?
What seats are,

995
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,820
um,
economic system.

996
00:41:25,821 --> 00:41:27,410
It means everyone else has to pay more
taxes.

997
00:41:27,411 --> 00:41:30,020
It puts more people on welfare.
All the things that Republicans hate

998
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,200
did.
It's a vulnerability thing.

999
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:34,920
They like women to be vulnerable maybe.
Hmm.

1000
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:36,500
Maybe.
And what they want control,

1001
00:41:36,501 --> 00:41:36,630
right.

1002
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:38,430
Control over it.
Yet we have complete control over people

1003
00:41:38,431 --> 00:41:40,080
they'd never met.
Why do you want to control the uterus of

1004
00:41:40,081 --> 00:41:42,090
a woman that lives 10 states down from
you?

1005
00:41:42,091 --> 00:41:42,640
How does that

1006
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,710
benefit?
There's a sick thing that people have

1007
00:41:44,711 --> 00:41:47,200
where they want to control people in a
lot of ways.

1008
00:41:47,201 --> 00:41:50,830
I think that's a lot of,
when you see people that are trying to

1009
00:41:50,831 --> 00:41:53,410
control people's language,
when you see people are trying to

1010
00:41:53,411 --> 00:41:54,430
restrict,
don't say this,

1011
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:56,770
say this,
we're don't say this isn't a weird

1012
00:41:56,771 --> 00:42:01,300
instinct that we need to address.
When you are outside of ideology,

1013
00:42:01,301 --> 00:42:04,270
outside of you know,
political lines that you cross.

1014
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:07,300
There's a weird instinct that people
have to try to control people.

1015
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,530
It's just a fear based sale

1016
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:13,000
I habits or thing that people do,
they don't have much control of

1017
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:15,140
themselves and they want to control
their people.

1018
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:18,650
And I think this is where bullying comes
from and I think this is where a lot of

1019
00:42:18,651 --> 00:42:22,440
what sexual harassment and just the
entitled meant the,

1020
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:25,820
the way bosses behave when they're
employed.

1021
00:42:25,821 --> 00:42:28,520
Like this is one of the things about
Harvey Weinstein and I've found found

1022
00:42:28,521 --> 00:42:32,810
fascinating is that he would bark it as
employees and it would run and they were

1023
00:42:32,811 --> 00:42:36,550
terrified and ice date a girl.
And she was a,

1024
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,740
when I first came to La,
wonderful woman,

1025
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:42,800
beautiful,
perfect personality,

1026
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:46,890
terrified of her boss.
She worked as an agent's assistant and

1027
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,520
she couldn't have been an actual person.
Yeah.

1028
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:50,660
And this girl would wake up in the
middle of the night,

1029
00:42:50,690 --> 00:42:51,700
terrified.
Sure.

1030
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:55,280
That her agent that she was working for
needed her to do something.

1031
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:56,540
She would freak out.
Sure.

1032
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:59,870
She was like constantly worried.
And this guy,

1033
00:42:59,871 --> 00:43:01,400
I mean,
she made terrible money.

1034
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:04,880
It was constant stress and she'd work
insane hours.

1035
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:08,420
I mean they would make,
she would make like $400 a week and she

1036
00:43:08,421 --> 00:43:11,660
was working fucking insane.
This is before they had the rules of,

1037
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:12,460
yeah.
You know,

1038
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:14,090
you don't know what she really made.
I'm just guessing.

1039
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:14,924
But she was always broke.

1040
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:17,340
And then my questions for you or that
it's in Stockholm Syndrome,

1041
00:43:17,341 --> 00:43:20,250
super rail saying yes.
And then what was her relationship with

1042
00:43:20,251 --> 00:43:22,230
her dad where she recreated her
childhood circumstances?

1043
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:24,030
It wasn't done.
That wasn't good.

1044
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:25,710
Yeah.
The relationship and then the epigenetic

1045
00:43:25,711 --> 00:43:26,400
imprinting.
It's,

1046
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,820
it's only till very,
very recently that we were not

1047
00:43:29,821 --> 00:43:33,660
completely dependent on men for our
survival and that you guys weren't

1048
00:43:33,661 --> 00:43:35,910
killing us in the street.
I'm like,

1049
00:43:35,911 --> 00:43:39,390
it's so recent in terms of human
evolution and um,

1050
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,670
you know,
I did this movie with Neal Brennan and

1051
00:43:41,671 --> 00:43:43,020
uh,
we wrote a song called again called the

1052
00:43:43,021 --> 00:43:45,570
female brain.
And it's about all the shit cause I'm

1053
00:43:45,571 --> 00:43:48,810
obsessed with figuring out and you're so
good at delineating what's nature and

1054
00:43:48,811 --> 00:43:50,460
what's nurture,
what's a choice and what's not.

1055
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:53,730
With biologically neurologically driven
and what's socially constructed.

1056
00:43:53,731 --> 00:43:55,440
I'm,
that's my fascination in life.

1057
00:43:55,441 --> 00:43:58,230
And like when all this stuff happens,
I'm always trying to figure out this

1058
00:43:58,231 --> 00:43:59,130
kind of behavioral stuff.

1059
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:01,680
And then that we had talked a lot about
epigenetic imprinting.

1060
00:44:01,681 --> 00:44:04,950
So it's like even if your girlfriend at
the time had not gone through some sort

1061
00:44:04,951 --> 00:44:06,840
of trauma with a man,
her mom certainly dead.

1062
00:44:06,841 --> 00:44:09,330
And then her mom's mom certainly dead
and she carries that with her.

1063
00:44:09,331 --> 00:44:12,390
So all of a sudden you're in 2016 and a
man is yelling at you and it's like

1064
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:17,550
flash back to 1850 when like one of your
ancestors was being fucking murdered by

1065
00:44:17,731 --> 00:44:18,780
a guy.
You know,

1066
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:20,310
like we just don't think about that kind
of stuff.

1067
00:44:20,311 --> 00:44:21,840
But what I meant to say is,
um,

1068
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,790
Neil had,
we used to have the storyline that was

1069
00:44:23,791 --> 00:44:25,920
about sexual harassment.
We ended up kind of changing it.

1070
00:44:25,921 --> 00:44:29,460
It's successfully strong and Blake
Griffin a storyline about her.

1071
00:44:29,490 --> 00:44:31,710
Um,
because women are generally for

1072
00:44:31,711 --> 00:44:33,780
consensus,
we get dopamine from consensus,

1073
00:44:33,781 --> 00:44:35,250
right?
Because we are physically weaker.

1074
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:38,340
I know nobody wants to talk about it.
And when you mean by consensus,

1075
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,740
what do you mean?
In terms of like if you guys are arguing

1076
00:44:40,741 --> 00:44:41,670
about something,
I mean,

1077
00:44:41,671 --> 00:44:44,400
we're on a show that kind of encourages,
you know,

1078
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:47,430
healthy discourse and I know you guys a
little bit and I feel safe here,

1079
00:44:47,431 --> 00:44:49,170
but in general,
in a work environment,

1080
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:52,770
I'm going to try to get everyone to
agree because 2000 years ago,

1081
00:44:52,771 --> 00:44:55,260
getting everyone to agree made my life
safer.

1082
00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:58,290
If I'm eight months pregnant,
I need protection from the whole tribe

1083
00:44:58,291 --> 00:45:01,020
and I want everyone to agree.
I'm going to pretend I agree with things

1084
00:45:01,021 --> 00:45:02,800
that maybe I actually don't,
don't make sense.

1085
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:06,120
We get dopamine from harmony because I'm
less able to defend myself,

1086
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:08,910
especially with men.
I need you to like me because I need

1087
00:45:08,911 --> 00:45:10,040
your protection.
Right?

1088
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:12,300
We're not that different.
I mean,

1089
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:16,590
200 years ago I needed your protection.
Like my brain has not caught up to the

1090
00:45:16,591 --> 00:45:20,940
fact that like it's illegal for you to
attack me and break me now.

1091
00:45:20,941 --> 00:45:24,030
You don't need anything though.
I think it means something to our

1092
00:45:24,031 --> 00:45:25,200
reptilian brains.

1093
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:27,200
You know?
Legal part doesn't mean anything.

1094
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:28,790
That's true.
No one,

1095
00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:29,840
no one's going to save you.

1096
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,860
Totally correct.
That's correct.

1097
00:45:31,861 --> 00:45:34,110
You could kill me or whenever you
wanted,

1098
00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:38,250
but 200 years ago it was like,
you know what w w there was no phones to

1099
00:45:38,251 --> 00:45:40,540
even call it a report anyway.
It was just much more common.

1100
00:45:40,541 --> 00:45:40,650
Yeah,

1101
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:45,390
I get what I'm saying today that like on
anyone saying that that fears alleviated

1102
00:45:45,391 --> 00:45:47,310
because there's laws against it as
crazy.

1103
00:45:47,610 --> 00:45:49,320
Totally.
Those fears are always there.

1104
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:50,730
Completely.
Yeah.

1105
00:45:50,731 --> 00:45:52,620
My reptile brain,
just in my conscious brain,

1106
00:45:52,621 --> 00:45:53,550
I'm sort of like,
okay,

1107
00:45:53,551 --> 00:45:55,950
it's less likely that this is going to
happen because we all have this illusion

1108
00:45:55,951 --> 00:45:57,300
of being civilized.
You know?

1109
00:45:57,510 --> 00:46:00,150
That's all horse shit.
I get nervous when I interview Francis

1110
00:46:00,151 --> 00:46:02,520
and Gando after a fight,
like when I got,

1111
00:46:02,521 --> 00:46:04,230
when I had to interview him Saturday
night,

1112
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:08,690
cause he's 265 pounds and six foot four
and he smashes people's heads and for

1113
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:11,070
living and I stand next to him and I
feel like a little tiny person.

1114
00:46:11,550 --> 00:46:14,380
There's just no getting around that.
And here's the thing and that's why it's

1115
00:46:14,381 --> 00:46:15,210
like that.
He likes me.

1116
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:16,350
I know he's not going to do anything to
me.

1117
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:19,660
I see what you're saying to me right now
is what I'm trying to explain to people

1118
00:46:19,661 --> 00:46:21,240
that are like,
I'm nursing the Fuckin Women's moon.

1119
00:46:21,241 --> 00:46:22,870
Why are you guys freaking out in the
office?

1120
00:46:22,871 --> 00:46:24,130
It's not like we're talking to those
people.

1121
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:24,800
It's,
it's like,

1122
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,050
what are we going to rape you?
It's like,

1123
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:28,450
yeah,
maybe I don't get an elevator's with

1124
00:46:28,451 --> 00:46:30,490
guys.
I just wait for the next one.

1125
00:46:30,491 --> 00:46:32,260
I'm scared.
We have tribal thinking.

1126
00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:34,300
It's in.
This is right now there's a tribal

1127
00:46:34,301 --> 00:46:39,010
boundaries that are being established on
the male and female side and people are

1128
00:46:39,011 --> 00:46:43,360
picking sides and there's a bunch of men
that are annoyed that people are talking

1129
00:46:43,361 --> 00:46:44,540
too much about women.
Yeah,

1130
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:46,000
and there's a bunch of women that are
saying,

1131
00:46:46,001 --> 00:46:50,050
now it's my time to be a fucking crazy
bitch and go crazy and attack all these

1132
00:46:50,051 --> 00:46:53,020
men and take dad tried to go at all,
but there are some,

1133
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:55,410
but there are so I know what I'm saying
is see,

1134
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:57,120
see you saying that right there.
Yeah.

1135
00:46:57,130 --> 00:46:59,060
We are not trying to do this.
Yeah.

1136
00:46:59,070 --> 00:47:01,470
That's a crazy thing to say because
you're not all women.

1137
00:47:01,471 --> 00:47:02,850
It's all in together.
I'm not all men.

1138
00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:03,820
That's crazy.

1139
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:05,560
Don't know anybody like that.
I do.

1140
00:47:05,561 --> 00:47:09,110
I don't who were on instagram.
People crazy.

1141
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:11,470
Yeah.
I follow a lot of really insane people

1142
00:47:11,471 --> 00:47:12,670
on instagram.
There's a lot of,

1143
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:14,350
like,
there was a woman that was,

1144
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:16,900
she's like an editor for vogue or
something like that that said,

1145
00:47:17,530 --> 00:47:22,240
here's an unpopular opinion.
I am not at all concerned with men being

1146
00:47:22,241 --> 00:47:26,050
falsely accused of sexual harassment or
sexual assault.

1147
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:28,800
That's irresponsible.
But they exist.

1148
00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:32,530
Those people exist.
There's the burn it all down people.

1149
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:34,780
Yeah.
That fuck them or burn it all down.

1150
00:47:34,781 --> 00:47:35,730
Yeah.
It

1151
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:38,350
doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.

1152
00:47:38,351 --> 00:47:39,870
It's inherently tribal.
Sure.

1153
00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:41,170
This is a tribal thing.
Yeah,

1154
00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:42,970
and it's not,
there's no nuance to that.

1155
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:45,820
There's no consideration of all the
different kinds of men.

1156
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:47,230
I,
there was a lot of men that are

1157
00:47:47,231 --> 00:47:49,340
considerate and friendly and nice and
they don't,

1158
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:51,130
and they're,
they're concentrating on themselves and

1159
00:47:51,131 --> 00:47:52,960
they don't want anything bad to happen
to anybody else.

1160
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:55,330
But then there's men who like,
fuck these bitches.

1161
00:47:55,331 --> 00:47:56,650
Yeah.
Fuck all women.

1162
00:47:56,651 --> 00:47:58,150
All.
They're all whores bitch and they listen

1163
00:47:58,151 --> 00:47:59,600
to rap music like,
yeah.

1164
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:02,290
I've been listening to a lot of like
really bad rap music lately.

1165
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:05,410
Dennis,
one of the rare places where you could

1166
00:48:05,411 --> 00:48:09,640
still just be a straight up massage.
And then do you think,

1167
00:48:09,641 --> 00:48:11,620
and I'm always,
and I don't know the answer to this,

1168
00:48:11,830 --> 00:48:14,380
do you think,
cause I think porn definitely affects

1169
00:48:14,381 --> 00:48:18,520
our psyche and how we view w dehumanize
women just just right.

1170
00:48:18,610 --> 00:48:21,970
Especially young people watching it.
Do you think that a rap song going

1171
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:25,180
destroy that Shit,
murder that shit,

1172
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:28,600
beat that pussy up.
Do you think that that affects the way

1173
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:32,120
men view women on like a cellular level?
It's,

1174
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:35,530
it's impossible that it doesn't,
it's impossible.

1175
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:38,710
When you have something that's
incredibly popular and you're repeating

1176
00:48:38,711 --> 00:48:43,180
the words to it over and over again,
I don't know what percent of an effect

1177
00:48:43,181 --> 00:48:44,940
it has on a 20 year old brain.
Right.

1178
00:48:45,010 --> 00:48:49,270
Whether it has a 5% effect,
you know over your parenting and what

1179
00:48:49,271 --> 00:48:50,770
your life experience is a bit.
Yeah.

1180
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:54,830
All the various different variables that
come into your,

1181
00:48:55,070 --> 00:48:56,500
your psyche.
Like what?

1182
00:48:56,501 --> 00:48:58,360
What?
What makes you a human being?

1183
00:48:58,361 --> 00:49:00,040
I don't know,
but that's a factor.

1184
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:01,270
It's a factor

1185
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:05,570
and is in what is in what happens when
you hear beat that pussy.

1186
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:06,890
Like is that,
why?

1187
00:49:06,891 --> 00:49:10,100
Do guys cheer for that?
Like aren't we also kind of on some

1188
00:49:10,101 --> 00:49:12,470
level wire to protect?
Why isn't it like I'm not,

1189
00:49:12,471 --> 00:49:14,090
I'm swearing too.
Is that a Tampon?

1190
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,310
Tattoos.
What is that?

1191
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:17,450
Oh it's a safety pen.
Oh yeah.

1192
00:49:20,350 --> 00:49:22,910
I'm trying to figure out what the fuck
that I do is on your wrist.

1193
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:30,020
What kind of monster do you think I am?
What kind of monster would get a slow

1194
00:49:30,021 --> 00:49:32,510
burn it all down like a,
it's like a,

1195
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,200
it's like a personal thing.
Okay.

1196
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:36,350
It's too,
it's too much of a mom or you don't want

1197
00:49:36,351 --> 00:49:38,210
me to tell you.
Most of my tattoos are white.

1198
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:41,030
I have white ones everywhere you are
fucking crazy.

1199
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:43,390
Here's what I will say is that burn it
all down.

1200
00:49:43,990 --> 00:49:46,890
We'll talk that doctors or why I wanted
the payment.

1201
00:49:46,910 --> 00:49:49,370
I didn't want anybody fucking 5,000
tattoos.

1202
00:49:49,371 --> 00:49:50,870
You're covered.
Why am I crazy?

1203
00:49:50,871 --> 00:49:53,670
Cause you can't see mine to say saying
I'm not crazy.

1204
00:49:53,671 --> 00:49:55,410
I'm crazy.
I'm probably pretty crazy.

1205
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:57,390
Yeah.
You hide it very well.

1206
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:00,170
You channel it,
you manage it in healthy ways.

1207
00:50:00,190 --> 00:50:00,891
Yeah.
You get it out.

1208
00:50:00,891 --> 00:50:01,060
Yeah.

1209
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:02,140
Oh,
if I didn't matter,

1210
00:50:02,141 --> 00:50:05,900
if you didn't work out every day,
would you just be monitoring and keeping

1211
00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:08,140
you in the streets?
Probably been to jail a long time ago.

1212
00:50:08,141 --> 00:50:10,600
You wouldn't be like breaking apes out
of zoos and fighting them.

1213
00:50:10,601 --> 00:50:13,660
I don't think that,
but I think I would have done something

1214
00:50:13,661 --> 00:50:15,390
really stupid a long time ago.
Yeah.

1215
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:16,110
Yeah.
I,

1216
00:50:16,110 --> 00:50:20,470
but I think that there's a lot of men
that have terrible,

1217
00:50:20,490 --> 00:50:23,890
uh,
genetics and instincts and environments

1218
00:50:23,891 --> 00:50:28,280
that they grow up in and there's a lot
of violence in your life and you

1219
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:30,300
will either find a way through that or,
yeah.

1220
00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:30,961
For me,
the,

1221
00:50:30,961 --> 00:50:34,490
the way through it was martial arts.
If I didn't find martial arts,

1222
00:50:34,790 --> 00:50:35,730
who knows.
Yeah.

1223
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:40,750
And I think that is one of the best ways
for men to not be pieces of shit to

1224
00:50:40,811 --> 00:50:42,350
know.
Cause I think a lot of the way people

1225
00:50:42,351 --> 00:50:46,160
behave is to insecurity.
I think a lot of pride in other things

1226
00:50:46,161 --> 00:50:50,030
so that you have watch a San Duexis is
it give you dental help too,

1227
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:54,590
but give you some security and give you
an outlet for your aggression and give

1228
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:57,560
you some humility.
Like in martial arts you get humility,

1229
00:50:57,561 --> 00:50:59,200
you get strangled all the time.
You,

1230
00:50:59,201 --> 00:51:00,260
you learn humility.

1231
00:51:02,330 --> 00:51:04,340
You can't have any ego will you do it to
them?

1232
00:51:04,341 --> 00:51:06,320
They do it to you are,
but he does it and you hug and there's

1233
00:51:06,321 --> 00:51:10,720
like real genuine love and affection
between the guys that I do Jujitsu with.

1234
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:12,030
It's very,
it's,

1235
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:13,760
it's,
it's very intense.

1236
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,280
It's as real as it gets.
And here's something,

1237
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:17,870
sorry,
I just wanted to go back to that vogue

1238
00:51:17,871 --> 00:51:19,850
woman for a second or whoever that was
because it's like,

1239
00:51:19,851 --> 00:51:23,390
I think what I'm trying to do is
understand like what a man acts in a way

1240
00:51:23,391 --> 00:51:25,460
that's violent or whatever.
I'm like,

1241
00:51:25,490 --> 00:51:27,320
what's the root of that?
What's going on?

1242
00:51:27,321 --> 00:51:30,530
What happened in his childhood?
Like what's going on biologically are

1243
00:51:30,531 --> 00:51:32,660
genetically,
or like what has he been taught?

1244
00:51:32,661 --> 00:51:35,540
Like he was failed somehow.
If a guy feels the need to like rape a

1245
00:51:35,541 --> 00:51:38,270
woman,
someone failed him or he's a sociopath

1246
00:51:38,271 --> 00:51:40,070
and just should be locked up or as
mentally ill,

1247
00:51:40,071 --> 00:51:43,910
but like he saw it from his dad,
he learned it hurt people hurt people.

1248
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:46,730
So it's like when a women says like all
men should,

1249
00:51:46,731 --> 00:51:49,370
I don't care if they're felt like,
I'm like what happened to her that made

1250
00:51:49,371 --> 00:51:51,460
her think that that's an okay.
That's her paradigm.

1251
00:51:51,461 --> 00:51:55,970
I probably met a bunch of fucking
assholes that something went wrong.

1252
00:51:56,410 --> 00:51:58,400
Yeah,
it was probably guys that she grew up

1253
00:51:58,401 --> 00:52:00,210
with,
guys that were in her life.

1254
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:03,040
The sexual traumas.
Totally.

1255
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:07,560
There's a lot of variables and I guess
I'm just trying to start a conversation.

1256
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:11,360
It's like let's explore what happened
back then and how do we sort of stop

1257
00:52:11,361 --> 00:52:14,720
that shit from going on.
Whether it's like sexual abuse,

1258
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:16,790
physical abuse,
whether it's like the messages we get

1259
00:52:16,791 --> 00:52:18,950
growing up of like,
and I don't know how you parent your

1260
00:52:19,610 --> 00:52:21,680
kids,
but the idea of like all I heard growing

1261
00:52:21,681 --> 00:52:23,690
up as calm down,
relax,

1262
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:26,510
it's fine.
Be Seen that like the messages that we

1263
00:52:26,570 --> 00:52:27,860
give kids,
calm down,

1264
00:52:27,861 --> 00:52:29,210
relax before about what?

1265
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:32,060
Anything.
Anytime I cried or I was injured or

1266
00:52:32,061 --> 00:52:32,511
whatever,
it was,

1267
00:52:32,511 --> 00:52:34,010
calm down.
You're overreacting.

1268
00:52:34,310 --> 00:52:39,310
That's what I heard as a kid growing up.
I think it did because overreacting,

1269
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:41,570
it caused me to,
I mean,

1270
00:52:41,571 --> 00:52:43,600
I was a kid.
I don't know when we,

1271
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:47,450
when kids,
kids should be assured like it's okay.

1272
00:52:47,451 --> 00:52:49,520
It's just a small booboo and you're
going to be fine.

1273
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:51,900
Normally what kids do when they're
crying,

1274
00:52:51,901 --> 00:52:54,290
it's they're just testing to see how
available you are to them.

1275
00:52:54,350 --> 00:52:55,940
Right?
So when you go calm down,

1276
00:52:55,941 --> 00:52:57,490
everything's fine.
Let me teach.

1277
00:52:57,590 --> 00:52:59,990
I don't know enough kids.
They do that.

1278
00:52:59,991 --> 00:53:02,630
But then they also recognize that it's a
way that they can get attention.

1279
00:53:02,631 --> 00:53:04,620
So they will overreact on purpose about
them.

1280
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:07,280
Yes,
they will have fits if they don't go to

1281
00:53:07,281 --> 00:53:08,240
the movie.
They like to see,

1282
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:11,360
like if my two daughters want to go see
a movie and one of them wins and the

1283
00:53:11,361 --> 00:53:12,860
other one starts throwing a temper
Tantrum,

1284
00:53:12,861 --> 00:53:13,694
you gotta go,
look,

1285
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:15,140
we're going to go see a fun movie.
Right?

1286
00:53:15,141 --> 00:53:17,420
Like you can't get pissed off next time
you'll get to choose.

1287
00:53:17,450 --> 00:53:18,500
Yeah.
This is crazy.

1288
00:53:18,501 --> 00:53:21,560
You can't stomp your feet and cry,
but she's seven.

1289
00:53:21,561 --> 00:53:22,394
Yeah,
totally.

1290
00:53:22,770 --> 00:53:26,280
This is like,
I have a chance explain

1291
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:28,610
to her that he,
these feelings are natural light.

1292
00:53:28,611 --> 00:53:29,730
Yeah.
You're gonna win some,

1293
00:53:29,731 --> 00:53:31,800
you're gonna lose some,
but you can't hold on to that.

1294
00:53:31,830 --> 00:53:33,120
You've got to let it go and realize,
oh,

1295
00:53:33,121 --> 00:53:35,130
we're still going to go to go to see a
fun movie.

1296
00:53:35,190 --> 00:53:36,660
Right.
It's just not going to be this one.

1297
00:53:36,661 --> 00:53:37,610
It's going to be that one.
Right.

1298
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:40,590
And you know what,
for whatever reason we made a decision.

1299
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:41,400
Sure.
You know,

1300
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:44,490
and we try to be as fair as possible,
but you can't have fucking temper

1301
00:53:44,491 --> 00:53:46,440
tantrums over and all the time,
oh,

1302
00:53:46,441 --> 00:53:48,940
we're going to the wrong restaurant
that,

1303
00:53:49,230 --> 00:53:50,340
you know,
kids do that.

1304
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,960
Sure.
That's because they're little kids.

1305
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:55,650
They're recognizing that there some
influence that they have some power over

1306
00:53:55,651 --> 00:53:56,170
you.

1307
00:53:56,170 --> 00:53:58,170
And then I'm going to see how much power
I can get.

1308
00:53:58,171 --> 00:54:00,100
Yeah.
And how much attention I can get and how

1309
00:54:00,101 --> 00:54:01,810
much I can play you.
So you just have to figure out the

1310
00:54:01,811 --> 00:54:03,100
difference.
I think for me,

1311
00:54:03,130 --> 00:54:05,770
I learned to invalidate my own reality
and stuff.

1312
00:54:05,771 --> 00:54:09,100
My field I ever met.
I remember a specific moment where I was

1313
00:54:09,101 --> 00:54:10,390
like,
you can't rely on adults.

1314
00:54:10,391 --> 00:54:14,020
They won't help you figure it out
yourself or don't have those feelings

1315
00:54:14,021 --> 00:54:15,700
are and validate those feelings,
you know?

1316
00:54:15,701 --> 00:54:18,160
And I think there's probably a that it's
bad parenting.

1317
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,230
You know what your kid did go like if
I'm hurt,

1318
00:54:20,231 --> 00:54:21,750
don't tell anyone because parenting is

1319
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:24,370
fucking confusing cause you try to
figure out what,

1320
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:29,640
what bad parenting you received.
I was lucky in that my parents were very

1321
00:54:30,101 --> 00:54:32,560
busy so I didn't get a lot of parenting.
Yeah,

1322
00:54:32,561 --> 00:54:33,700
me too.
Same Way.

1323
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:37,300
So it wasn't,
it wasn't like I got bad parenting.

1324
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:39,360
I didn't get back there.
Yeah.

1325
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:41,840
Don't let anybody who is mean to me.
Yeah.

1326
00:54:41,950 --> 00:54:42,731
I just got,
yeah,

1327
00:54:42,731 --> 00:54:46,030
it was alone a lot.
But then I found things to occupy my

1328
00:54:46,031 --> 00:54:48,790
time.
So that literally became like those

1329
00:54:48,791 --> 00:54:52,000
obsessions that I,
that I developed when I was young with

1330
00:54:52,001 --> 00:54:54,430
various things,
whether it was art or martial arts or

1331
00:54:54,431 --> 00:54:57,010
whatever.
Those things became my vehicles for

1332
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:59,310
developing my human potential.
And that,

1333
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:01,390
do you think you got a lot of eye
contact as a kid?

1334
00:55:02,890 --> 00:55:04,480
I never thought about that until just
now

1335
00:55:05,070 --> 00:55:06,120
fairly.
That's a big one.

1336
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:08,370
Eye contact,
eye contact and physical touch in the

1337
00:55:08,371 --> 00:55:09,204
first couple of years

1338
00:55:09,390 --> 00:55:11,730
we're affectionate.
My family's always been affectionate.

1339
00:55:11,731 --> 00:55:12,960
It's always been huggy.
Yeah.

1340
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:15,330
You know,
and I'm real hug you with my family too.

1341
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:17,560
I think and I'm hugging with my friends
too.

1342
00:55:18,510 --> 00:55:22,140
I think that's super important and I
think it's also a very important to tow

1343
00:55:22,170 --> 00:55:24,570
your friends.
Like I tell everybody I love them.

1344
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:25,920
Yeah,
that's awesome.

1345
00:55:25,921 --> 00:55:27,870
I mean I know I got really into John
Bowlby,

1346
00:55:27,871 --> 00:55:31,110
Siri of attachment because I couldn't
make eye contact until like two years

1347
00:55:31,111 --> 00:55:32,670
ago.
Like I would always kind of look here.

1348
00:55:33,340 --> 00:55:34,830
Yeah.
This is how I used to always look at

1349
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:37,350
people and then I just recently started
making I and make,

1350
00:55:37,410 --> 00:55:38,820
it still makes me a little bit
uncomfortable.

1351
00:55:38,850 --> 00:55:41,460
It's like a muscle,
but I had something called infant

1352
00:55:41,461 --> 00:55:43,680
maternal disruption,
which is basically you just didn't get

1353
00:55:43,681 --> 00:55:47,100
enough eye contact.
So apparently the amount of eye contact

1354
00:55:47,101 --> 00:55:50,040
and doesn't know this because I'm,
cause I can't make it now.

1355
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:53,570
But isn't that just an insecure guy?
I used to get real insecure.

1356
00:55:53,571 --> 00:55:56,540
I've talked about this before or talking
to a bank teller.

1357
00:55:56,541 --> 00:55:58,520
I'd freak out why?
I get nervous.

1358
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:01,970
I was nervous,
but only bank tellers or just anywhere.

1359
00:56:01,971 --> 00:56:06,290
I remember being in the bank getting
ready to deposit a check and in line,

1360
00:56:06,291 --> 00:56:09,340
just two people ahead of me was the
times of the comedy story.

1361
00:56:09,350 --> 00:56:12,440
You didn't know if it will go through.
That was before the way before then.

1362
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:13,910
It was before I did comedy.

1363
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:14,711
Was it,
did it,

1364
00:56:14,711 --> 00:56:16,180
did it had anything to do with a man or
a woman?

1365
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:17,820
No.
No,

1366
00:56:17,910 --> 00:56:18,900
it didn't matter.
It's just,

1367
00:56:18,901 --> 00:56:20,400
I just was nervous talking to people.

1368
00:56:20,650 --> 00:56:22,210
That's so interesting.
I like that too.

1369
00:56:22,211 --> 00:56:24,340
Like the couple of minutes you talked to
me all the time.

1370
00:56:24,341 --> 00:56:26,500
I get a little shade,
like I'm socially awkward in the

1371
00:56:26,501 --> 00:56:28,510
beginning and then I sort of settle in.
But I,

1372
00:56:28,511 --> 00:56:31,120
I do get a little shaky when I first
talked to people even now.

1373
00:56:31,370 --> 00:56:32,540
Well,
I feel that with you.

1374
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:35,500
I feel like I have to say we're friends,
we love you.

1375
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:37,050
We're friends,
we're friends,

1376
00:56:37,051 --> 00:56:37,884
right?
Yes,

1377
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:42,960
we're friends right away with the porn
and the hoverboards you like this is

1378
00:56:43,730 --> 00:56:46,820
really shouldn't bring this up.
Like what are you talking get whatever

1379
00:56:46,821 --> 00:56:47,810
the fuck you want to say.

1380
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:49,421
Um,
you know,

1381
00:56:49,421 --> 00:56:51,550
and I,
and I also have this condition called

1382
00:56:51,551 --> 00:56:53,080
codependence.
I'm working on it.

1383
00:56:53,230 --> 00:56:56,440
Um,
but I'm fucking dealing with it.

1384
00:56:56,441 --> 00:56:59,680
It's expensive to handle.
It's very time consuming to rewire your

1385
00:56:59,681 --> 00:57:01,510
brain around it.
But when I first meet someone,

1386
00:57:01,511 --> 00:57:04,120
it's like a,
it's like a chameleon response where

1387
00:57:04,121 --> 00:57:04,954
it's like,
um,

1388
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:08,620
when you grow up in an alcoholic home or
if you have codependence the first thing

1389
00:57:08,621 --> 00:57:12,310
you do is you meet someone and you kind
of try to figure out what they want and

1390
00:57:12,311 --> 00:57:15,520
then you morphed to become what makes
them comfortable.

1391
00:57:15,610 --> 00:57:17,620
So I still have to fight that response
sometimes,

1392
00:57:17,621 --> 00:57:21,070
especially with,
especially with men and then with women

1393
00:57:21,270 --> 00:57:23,290
because though we didn't do that for
sure.

1394
00:57:23,291 --> 00:57:25,930
Like are you in a football are going to
be like who is this guy and how am I

1395
00:57:25,931 --> 00:57:28,170
going to make him like me?
That's kind of what codependence

1396
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:31,090
well men do that with other men but they
also do that with women.

1397
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:33,130
They'll become like what the woman
wants.

1398
00:57:33,131 --> 00:57:35,800
Like women will.
I see it a lot of times my friends with

1399
00:57:35,810 --> 00:57:37,930
the way they dress like the woman who
come along.

1400
00:57:37,950 --> 00:57:40,480
Yeah.
Well also the women are mold men.

1401
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:43,450
Like women will get men in shape.
Like you should just lose someone

1402
00:57:43,580 --> 00:57:46,100
like in a relationship.
I just mean like when I first meet

1403
00:57:46,101 --> 00:57:49,370
someone my instinct is kind of like how
do I make an a specialty with it?

1404
00:57:49,430 --> 00:57:52,910
It has taken me so long to not be funny
when I'm not doing stand up.

1405
00:57:53,210 --> 00:57:55,520
Cause like the for my first instinct is
makes this person laugh,

1406
00:57:55,521 --> 00:57:58,910
make them like you and I kind of have to
like manually be like turn that shit

1407
00:57:58,911 --> 00:58:01,280
off.
You're not five and you're not trying to

1408
00:58:01,281 --> 00:58:03,300
get the approval of your dad.
Like not your dad

1409
00:58:03,670 --> 00:58:05,920
turn it off.
But what if you just see something

1410
00:58:05,921 --> 00:58:08,050
funny,
you're still free enough to just be

1411
00:58:08,051 --> 00:58:08,700
funny.

1412
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:09,660
Can do that.
But it's like,

1413
00:58:09,661 --> 00:58:11,790
my motive is not,
I'm trying to make this person told me

1414
00:58:11,791 --> 00:58:12,624
my

1415
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:15,330
all the time.
You know the people who are on all the

1416
00:58:15,331 --> 00:58:16,770
time,
just say his name,

1417
00:58:18,050 --> 00:58:21,960
his name,
genuinely.

1418
00:58:21,961 --> 00:58:26,961
Brian isn't trying to get anyone to know
he's not getting it,

1419
00:58:27,241 --> 00:58:30,810
but he's just really funny and he loves
being that Brian is at its best.

1420
00:58:30,811 --> 00:58:32,970
And I've said this before,
there's an innocence to it.

1421
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,140
He's at his best in a group of people.
Correct.

1422
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:38,610
Not on stage.
He's out of around 20 people.

1423
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:40,500
If you've got 20 people and they're
going somewhere,

1424
00:58:40,501 --> 00:58:41,790
Brian's on guys.
Guys,

1425
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:46,460
guys just want to show you something.
He'll just,

1426
00:58:46,590 --> 00:58:48,920
he'll just be this.
He's fucking,

1427
00:58:49,050 --> 00:58:52,830
I've never met anybody that makes me
laugh harder just in groups of people

1428
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:55,740
other than Joe Diaz kills me.
But Joey Diaz is the opposite.

1429
00:58:55,741 --> 00:58:57,200
Joey Diaz is not trying to do,

1430
00:58:57,630 --> 00:58:59,380
he's just naturally,
it's not a performance.

1431
00:58:59,570 --> 00:59:02,310
I just wonder Brian callen knows the
difference anymore.

1432
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:03,980
Like is there a certain point where you
don't even,

1433
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:06,080
you can't even tell when you're
performing and when you're not.

1434
00:59:06,081 --> 00:59:07,310
It's like just tease,
morphed,

1435
00:59:07,311 --> 00:59:08,210
doesn't matter.
He doesn't care.

1436
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:08,660
Yeah.

1437
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:13,660
He has a bizarre ability to not fair.
If people were upset at him,

1438
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:17,180
it's like he's got this weird almost
Peter Pan,

1439
00:59:17,181 --> 00:59:18,320
like way of moving through life.

1440
00:59:18,410 --> 00:59:19,490
It's cracked.
I am,

1441
00:59:19,510 --> 00:59:23,180
I am in therapy and a 12 program to get
the inner monologue of Brian Callan.

1442
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:26,030
If I could just have an iota of the self
esteem that he has.

1443
00:59:26,070 --> 00:59:28,520
Do you do meditate?
I do.

1444
00:59:28,610 --> 00:59:33,610
I lost my dad last year and meditate
like suddenly and my meditation,

1445
00:59:35,450 --> 00:59:38,210
I started getting too sad.
Like I couldn't close my eyes for 20

1446
00:59:38,211 --> 00:59:39,560
minutes,
so I've stopped for the past like six

1447
00:59:39,561 --> 00:59:41,690
months.
But I'm trying because I need to build

1448
00:59:41,691 --> 00:59:42,680
those neural pathways.

1449
00:59:42,930 --> 00:59:44,490
Well,
I feel like you're always,

1450
00:59:44,550 --> 00:59:47,790
do you know that feeling when you're
running down a hill or it's super hard

1451
00:59:47,791 --> 00:59:50,650
to stop
this momentum?

1452
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:51,191
It's like,
Whoa,

1453
00:59:51,191 --> 00:59:51,561
Whoa,
whoa,

1454
00:59:51,561 --> 00:59:51,901
Whoa,
whoa.

1455
00:59:51,901 --> 00:59:53,940
You're still up.
But it's fucking,

1456
00:59:54,030 --> 00:59:55,740
it's tricky.
That's how I feel.

1457
00:59:55,741 --> 00:59:58,260
You are like you're running on a slight
angle,

1458
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:00,540
you know,
you're not flat.

1459
01:00:00,650 --> 01:00:01,760
Yeah,
it's not,

1460
01:00:02,010 --> 01:00:03,350
you're,
you're always like a little,

1461
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:05,720
ah,
I'm fucking,

1462
01:00:05,990 --> 01:00:07,850
I am sometimes.
Um,

1463
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:09,590
I think in the last,
yeah,

1464
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:12,800
I agree.
I'm trying to answer in a way that,

1465
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:14,630
uh,
makes you seem wrong,

1466
01:00:14,631 --> 01:00:16,550
but I realize you're,
you're pretty right.

1467
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:20,210
And I think that also in the last couple
of years that we've gotten to know each

1468
01:00:20,211 --> 01:00:22,550
other I hadn't been doing is not as much
stand up.

1469
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:25,190
And when I don't do standup,
I get a little manic.

1470
01:00:25,790 --> 01:00:28,970
I think that standup serves a really
important like release and Catharsis

1471
01:00:28,971 --> 01:00:31,880
purpose where I'm much more calm when
I'm not performing.

1472
01:00:31,881 --> 01:00:32,750
When I do stand up right here,

1473
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:35,170
get it out right.
You get out those thoughts,

1474
01:00:35,210 --> 01:00:38,300
these,
these antagonistic protagonistic

1475
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:40,670
thoughts,
all these deer weird little ideas that

1476
01:00:40,671 --> 01:00:44,930
are wrestling in your head.
Like you can put them into a comedy form

1477
01:00:45,170 --> 01:00:46,580
and then deliver that.
I'm on stage.

1478
01:00:46,581 --> 01:00:50,150
It's a very cathartic way of releasing
ideas sometimes.

1479
01:00:50,270 --> 01:00:52,460
And then when the audience laughs,
you know,

1480
01:00:52,461 --> 01:00:53,400
and you're like,
ah,

1481
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:55,250
I nailed this.
I'm on to something here.

1482
01:00:55,251 --> 01:00:55,720
I got it.

1483
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:57,190
And there's just,
I think that,

1484
01:00:57,220 --> 01:00:58,330
you know,
again,

1485
01:00:58,710 --> 01:01:00,110
not to beat the,
I come from a,

1486
01:01:00,250 --> 01:01:05,250
we as we all do tricky home and I think
that my brain seeks a con control or

1487
01:01:05,501 --> 01:01:07,930
even a false sense of control.
Soothes it.

1488
01:01:07,931 --> 01:01:10,510
And when I do standup,
you kind of get to have control for at

1489
01:01:10,511 --> 01:01:13,330
least the 20 minutes or an hour that
you're on stage and everything feels

1490
01:01:13,331 --> 01:01:14,770
like it's an order.
I know my place.

1491
01:01:14,771 --> 01:01:17,350
You know your place.
It is a very clearly defined rules.

1492
01:01:17,650 --> 01:01:18,940
I'm talking,
you're laughing,

1493
01:01:18,941 --> 01:01:19,990
I'm talking,
you're laughing.

1494
01:01:19,991 --> 01:01:22,690
And that makes me feel really calm.
Whereas going through the world with

1495
01:01:22,691 --> 01:01:23,560
like,
I don't know who you are,

1496
01:01:23,561 --> 01:01:24,470
you're dangerous.
I don't,

1497
01:01:24,490 --> 01:01:26,200
you know,
like I have a hyperactive Amygdala,

1498
01:01:26,201 --> 01:01:30,850
so it's like during the day I'm just
very dysregulated and doing standup is

1499
01:01:30,851 --> 01:01:31,391
just,
I don't know,

1500
01:01:31,391 --> 01:01:35,080
I just feel very like,
I know where everybody's places and I

1501
01:01:35,081 --> 01:01:36,610
feel safe for that amount of time.

1502
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:40,690
Do you get calmed down by working out
a little bit?

1503
01:01:40,691 --> 01:01:43,600
Because my motive for working out is so
fucked up.

1504
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:46,030
It's not like,
you know,

1505
01:01:46,031 --> 01:01:49,750
I'm working more on like working out to
get strong and to get healthy.

1506
01:01:49,751 --> 01:01:52,630
But for the longest time it was like to
get skinny and to look fuckable,

1507
01:01:52,810 --> 01:01:54,280
you know?
So working out was like,

1508
01:01:54,550 --> 01:01:57,250
I was kind of hate fucking it.
I wasn't like doing it because I enjoyed

1509
01:01:57,251 --> 01:02:00,670
it or wanting to be doing it.
So I'm trying to sort of find a new

1510
01:02:00,671 --> 01:02:01,950
motive.
Um,

1511
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:03,400
we'll kind of exercise.
Do you do,

1512
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:08,940
I get bored and I used to work with a
trainer and I stopped and so I started

1513
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:13,090
just started doing it myself,
like lifting and I've just want to have

1514
01:02:13,091 --> 01:02:14,920
a big butt.
That's all I really care about.

1515
01:02:14,921 --> 01:02:16,480
I'm just won an ass.
So I'm like,

1516
01:02:16,481 --> 01:02:19,140
used that machine.
Is it called the Jimmy John Vinci?

1517
01:02:19,410 --> 01:02:20,243
I don't know

1518
01:02:20,370 --> 01:02:25,370
the one that likes
Jimmy Dean each immedion sausage to make

1519
01:02:25,561 --> 01:02:28,170
my ass bigger than,
do you know what I'm talking about?

1520
01:02:28,410 --> 01:02:29,820
It's a,
it's a squat machine,

1521
01:02:29,821 --> 01:02:32,400
but it has like a little helper has
little claws.

1522
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:35,280
What does that,
this machine is the,

1523
01:02:35,281 --> 01:02:35,831
uh,
the,

1524
01:02:35,831 --> 01:02:38,850
the rack where the squat goes up and
down.

1525
01:02:39,090 --> 01:02:41,130
It's just taught,
turn it forward to catch it.

1526
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,320
Why don't you add to that?
Yeah,

1527
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:45,450
that's a good machine to do.
It's good.

1528
01:02:45,451 --> 01:02:48,690
It's good to do on your own.
That's actually just,

1529
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:49,860
Oh yeah,
that's a Smith machine.

1530
01:02:49,861 --> 01:02:51,360
Yeah.
That's what I do at the gym.

1531
01:02:51,510 --> 01:02:54,660
Cause those are good.
And then I do a lot of people don't like

1532
01:02:54,661 --> 01:02:55,890
those because you don't have to balance
them.

1533
01:02:55,891 --> 01:02:57,650
No.
The idea is that there's,

1534
01:02:57,651 --> 01:03:00,180
there's a benefit to all the stabilizing
muscles.

1535
01:03:00,181 --> 01:03:01,820
Like if you have a real,
uh,

1536
01:03:02,660 --> 01:03:05,880
a real bar,
I'm sure you do to add.

1537
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:07,710
If I do that when I'm afraid I'll hurt
myself.

1538
01:03:08,070 --> 01:03:12,840
The Jimmy John Helps me to not,
I'm not like a professional athlete.

1539
01:03:12,841 --> 01:03:15,240
I'm just like,
should get a hug in pill form,

1540
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:17,200
take it five times day,
whatever.

1541
01:03:17,201 --> 01:03:19,200
He just getting,
everything's going to be in here,

1542
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:22,380
get a pill form.
But uh,

1543
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:25,780
I was doing like soul cycle.
I was doing like spinning for a while

1544
01:03:26,580 --> 01:03:29,550
just because whatever,
there's a great episode of the

1545
01:03:29,551 --> 01:03:31,570
unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,
man.

1546
01:03:32,550 --> 01:03:33,660
You ever watch that show?
No.

1547
01:03:33,661 --> 01:03:35,420
It's funny though.
I've seen a couple episodes.

1548
01:03:35,570 --> 01:03:38,370
Hilarious.
Gray went down for like two episodes and

1549
01:03:38,371 --> 01:03:41,820
I almost abandoned it.
Tell you folks if you're watching it

1550
01:03:41,821 --> 01:03:43,310
now,
because I've talked a lot of people in

1551
01:03:43,311 --> 01:03:46,110
to watching it.
When you get to like episode six of

1552
01:03:46,111 --> 01:03:47,580
season one,
don't panic.

1553
01:03:47,610 --> 01:03:52,200
It's sucks for two episodes and then it
bounces back wrong.

1554
01:03:52,410 --> 01:03:54,630
It's hilarious.
And they made fun of spinning.

1555
01:03:54,930 --> 01:03:59,040
Oh there's one with a nick kroll and
he's,

1556
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:03,570
he's the spinach truck and I don't want
to give it up to any of that but,

1557
01:04:03,810 --> 01:04:05,730
but it's like,
it's a cult,

1558
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:08,430
these fucking soul cycle.
Cycle and cry.

1559
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:12,420
I'm not fucking kidding.
They'll play like sheryl crow or like

1560
01:04:12,421 --> 01:04:14,040
pain.
Like Neil,

1561
01:04:14,070 --> 01:04:17,160
Brendan always says that I have the
musical taste of a 45 year old divorcee.

1562
01:04:17,340 --> 01:04:19,710
I love an inspirational Kelly Clarkson
time.

1563
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:24,000
I swear to fucking God.
Sheryl crow,

1564
01:04:24,001 --> 01:04:26,730
Alana's Morissette.
I will just get in there and you just

1565
01:04:26,731 --> 01:04:29,940
start crying because you were in a lot
of pain and you're working really hard

1566
01:04:29,941 --> 01:04:32,460
and you're just vulnerable and we feel
like it's okay to cry cause you're

1567
01:04:32,461 --> 01:04:34,890
sweating and it's like no one's going to
know sweater tears.

1568
01:04:34,891 --> 01:04:37,410
It's me and a bunch of book publicists
crying,

1569
01:04:37,650 --> 01:04:41,540
but Jim Publicist,
cause it's $35 a fucking class.

1570
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:43,640
It's crazy.
You know that much.

1571
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:46,770
I mean if you buy like a hundred
packages,

1572
01:04:46,771 --> 01:04:50,880
it ends up being like 28 I have a thing
called a Peloton bike.

1573
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:52,070
Oh that's the,
no,

1574
01:04:52,070 --> 01:04:52,791
no,
I tried it.

1575
01:04:52,791 --> 01:04:55,830
It's supposed to be amazing.
I tried somebody else's do a live spin

1576
01:04:55,831 --> 01:04:57,870
class with people.
We have it here.

1577
01:04:57,900 --> 01:04:59,770
So do you just spin it and you like it?
No,

1578
01:04:59,790 --> 01:05:02,150
they give it to me.
I use it,

1579
01:05:02,410 --> 01:05:03,750
but I have one here.

1580
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:08,900
I can get in a groove and I can check
out and think about other things and

1581
01:05:09,530 --> 01:05:13,200
it's like a moving meditation for me.
That's how I feel about regular running.

1582
01:05:13,230 --> 01:05:16,650
When I run the hills I love running,
but now I'm running with my dog.

1583
01:05:16,651 --> 01:05:18,070
It's a different because I always have

1584
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:20,890
to keep an eye on him,
but he's pretty good.

1585
01:05:20,891 --> 01:05:24,970
He waits and waits for me and then I run
and he's so much different than any dog.

1586
01:05:25,510 --> 01:05:27,420
She's just following now.
He's just running amazing.

1587
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:28,480
Yeah,
he's great.

1588
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:30,580
He's great,
but he's not at all.

1589
01:05:30,581 --> 01:05:35,050
My other dogs have been psycho so I've
had to have them on leashes cause they

1590
01:05:35,051 --> 01:05:39,430
would attack their dog dug holes.
I had a bunch of pit bulls so I'd run

1591
01:05:39,431 --> 01:05:42,470
with them and you know,
and my masters,

1592
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:44,320
I just never ran with him.
He's too fucking big.

1593
01:05:44,750 --> 01:05:46,630
This thing is bad for,
it's hard on their bones.

1594
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:49,360
He's limping a little bit too.
He runs around too much in the yard.

1595
01:05:49,361 --> 01:05:50,170
He loves.
Yeah,

1596
01:05:50,170 --> 01:05:51,430
he's huge.
They're too big.

1597
01:05:51,431 --> 01:05:56,160
There was sort of meant to just hang out
and I'm running really steep inclines.

1598
01:05:56,620 --> 01:05:57,670
Golden retriever.
Yeah.

1599
01:05:57,700 --> 01:05:59,350
That's great.
That dog is,

1600
01:05:59,351 --> 01:06:00,240
that's great for them.

1601
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:02,320
Running with animals,
the best feeling.

1602
01:06:02,470 --> 01:06:05,890
But me and him have this crazy bond
that's like when we stop,

1603
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:09,130
I'll stop on a run the hills.
I'll pause cause it's like,

1604
01:06:09,131 --> 01:06:10,840
you know,
I'm running this big sprint up to the up

1605
01:06:10,841 --> 01:06:13,630
the hill and then he'll,
he'll sit and wait with me and then he

1606
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:15,610
just like,
I love you when they like jump up and

1607
01:06:15,611 --> 01:06:16,444
kiss me.
And I'm like,

1608
01:06:16,750 --> 01:06:18,310
I love you too buddy.
Like calm down.

1609
01:06:18,311 --> 01:06:21,130
But it's like he's so excited that I do
this with them.

1610
01:06:21,340 --> 01:06:22,800
He loves it.
We have grateful,

1611
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:24,790
oh yeah.
This crazy bond thing going on.

1612
01:06:24,791 --> 01:06:26,290
Yeah.
That makes me so happy.

1613
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:27,710
It's really intense.
But yeah,

1614
01:06:27,790 --> 01:06:30,010
I've always been like,
he's a sweet dog.

1615
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:31,810
I bonded with them from the moment we
got him.

1616
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:34,120
Yeah.
But we have this extra bond now that we

1617
01:06:34,121 --> 01:06:35,800
run three or four times a week.
Oh yeah,

1618
01:06:35,801 --> 01:06:36,880
totally.
We'll you're a pack.

1619
01:06:37,110 --> 01:06:37,970
Yeah.
A pack together.

1620
01:06:37,971 --> 01:06:39,190
And then if you're running,
you guys have a date.

1621
01:06:39,220 --> 01:06:41,880
He found some shit.
I don't know if it was his shit cause

1622
01:06:42,310 --> 01:06:45,900
usually shits in this area and he just
laid down on it,

1623
01:06:45,910 --> 01:06:47,260
started rubbing on it,

1624
01:06:48,790 --> 01:06:52,120
dog to hike and he came back.
He lie,

1625
01:06:52,130 --> 01:06:53,080
like let him go.
I was like,

1626
01:06:53,081 --> 01:06:53,950
all right,
let's see how this goes.

1627
01:06:53,951 --> 01:06:55,690
Let's see if this is going to end the
lawsuit for me.

1628
01:06:56,050 --> 01:06:57,790
And uh,
so I let him go.

1629
01:06:57,791 --> 01:06:59,260
He comes back,
he's covered in like,

1630
01:06:59,590 --> 01:07:01,610
he smells like,
like wharf.

1631
01:07:01,630 --> 01:07:04,360
I can't even explain the rancid smell.
I was just like,

1632
01:07:04,750 --> 01:07:06,580
what is that?
And he's covered in like,

1633
01:07:06,581 --> 01:07:08,410
he's got like stringy licks.
I'm like,

1634
01:07:08,411 --> 01:07:10,570
I said Spaghetti and then I keep
walking.

1635
01:07:10,571 --> 01:07:14,470
There's a dead deer.
He had rolled in a dead deer carcass.

1636
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:15,760
Oh,
so you get all the water was just

1637
01:07:15,761 --> 01:07:19,360
covered in worms and guts and eyeball.
And I was like,

1638
01:07:19,390 --> 01:07:21,160
Oh fuck now I,
I'm,

1639
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:25,540
you're up for adoption.
Weird dogs like they like smell because

1640
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:27,100
don't they do it?
Cause my dogs,

1641
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:28,040
um,
when a po,

1642
01:07:28,180 --> 01:07:29,650
coyotes,
coyotes.

1643
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:31,330
Um,
when coyotes,

1644
01:07:31,690 --> 01:07:32,830
ah,
shit in my yard,

1645
01:07:32,860 --> 01:07:35,380
my girl roles in it.
Cause don't you do it so that the

1646
01:07:35,381 --> 01:07:37,270
coyotes think you're on the pack so they
don't kill you.

1647
01:07:37,690 --> 01:07:39,830
Ooh,
I think that's what you do at wow.

1648
01:07:40,150 --> 01:07:42,520
Fire up that Google and make sure I'm
not wrong.

1649
01:07:42,820 --> 01:07:45,400
Yeah,
they roll in the shit so that the coyote

1650
01:07:45,401 --> 01:07:46,234
doesn't kill them.

1651
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:51,660
There's a guy I follow on instagram that
has a pet coyote and he hunts coyotes

1652
01:07:52,060 --> 01:07:56,140
and he uses this pet coyote help them
hunt coyotes.

1653
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:58,000
I know like this person dogs and they
hunt.

1654
01:07:58,001 --> 01:07:58,661
Cut.
Well,

1655
01:07:58,661 --> 01:08:03,430
hunting coyote is important in areas
where coyotes attack deer.

1656
01:08:03,431 --> 01:08:06,700
Fawns and coyotes.
Is this in California?

1657
01:08:06,730 --> 01:08:07,580
No,
no,

1658
01:08:07,630 --> 01:08:08,890
he's,
he's a hunter.

1659
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:11,250
I mean the guys that just a hunter
period.

1660
01:08:11,650 --> 01:08:13,990
One of the things that he's done,
he found a puppy,

1661
01:08:14,170 --> 01:08:16,040
a coyote puppy that had been abandoned

1662
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:18,320
and so he adopted it and she lives with
them.

1663
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:22,250
It's really weird.
Coyotes can attuned to human faces.

1664
01:08:22,251 --> 01:08:23,720
Like they're basically sociopathic.
They,

1665
01:08:23,721 --> 01:08:25,550
they're not like dogs.
You can't domesticate them.

1666
01:08:25,551 --> 01:08:28,490
Yeah,
maybe not true because this dog seems to

1667
01:08:28,491 --> 01:08:32,950
be very playful with him and like cause
biting his hand and I looked at and

1668
01:08:32,951 --> 01:08:34,430
then,
but not hurting him and these,

1669
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:38,300
he's petting it and the dogs,
it's playing with other dogs,

1670
01:08:38,690 --> 01:08:40,280
you know,
but you can raise,

1671
01:08:40,281 --> 01:08:43,490
cause it's like it's a baby and work
with these,

1672
01:08:43,491 --> 01:08:45,350
this place wolf connection.
And essentially it's like,

1673
01:08:45,351 --> 01:08:46,910
I'm always like,
well which one's the most wolf?

1674
01:08:46,911 --> 01:08:48,220
Which one is the highest content of
Wolf?

1675
01:08:48,221 --> 01:08:49,700
Wolfen it like with the blood and
they're like,

1676
01:08:49,701 --> 01:08:52,370
it doesn't really matter.
It's back to the nature nurture thing.

1677
01:08:52,490 --> 01:08:55,490
It's that there are some wolves that
were raised by dogs that have more

1678
01:08:55,491 --> 01:08:58,220
doglike qualities and some dogs are
raise like waltz and have more wolf

1679
01:08:58,221 --> 01:08:59,030
light qualities.

1680
01:08:59,030 --> 01:09:01,010
It's like the nature and nurture thing.
Yeah,

1681
01:09:01,011 --> 01:09:02,740
that makes sense.
This Chi,

1682
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:04,910
this is what does it got rolling and
feces.

1683
01:09:04,911 --> 01:09:07,820
They're really common and possibly dogs,
ancient instinct to mask his sent,

1684
01:09:07,821 --> 01:09:10,640
which then able to animal to sneak up on
their prey without detection.

1685
01:09:11,110 --> 01:09:13,400
Ah,
so you might keep her.

1686
01:09:13,790 --> 01:09:16,610
So all I guess dogs do it with other dog
poop as well.

1687
01:09:16,730 --> 01:09:19,580
But my dog doesn't roll in my other dog
shit.

1688
01:09:19,610 --> 01:09:22,070
Only Coyote Shit.
Why does it,

1689
01:09:22,071 --> 01:09:25,640
you know what I mean?
So anything or fucking tanks,

1690
01:09:25,670 --> 01:09:27,410
huge.
They're probably not worried about a

1691
01:09:27,411 --> 01:09:31,610
fucking coyotes hunt in fucking packs
and they learn are one and they surround

1692
01:09:31,611 --> 01:09:33,680
them.
And tell you the story about the guy who

1693
01:09:33,681 --> 01:09:37,730
worked at the pet food store.
I worked at a pet food store,

1694
01:09:37,731 --> 01:09:41,210
also worked at a veterinarian's place
and they got this dog in,

1695
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:44,710
it was one of those giant pit bulls,
one of those like hundred and 20 pounds

1696
01:09:44,711 --> 01:09:46,520
and muscular damn pit bulls.

1697
01:09:47,030 --> 01:09:49,610
And it was covered with cuts all over
its body.

1698
01:09:49,611 --> 01:09:51,830
We're cool card,
hundreds and hundreds of stitches.

1699
01:09:52,250 --> 01:09:54,230
And so he asked the owner like,
what happened was,

1700
01:09:54,231 --> 01:09:55,130
I don't know.
He goes,

1701
01:09:55,131 --> 01:09:57,050
I came home and he had gotten out of the
yard.

1702
01:09:57,051 --> 01:09:59,330
He was covered in blood.
It was all fucked up because I don't

1703
01:09:59,331 --> 01:10:01,280
know what happened.
And so,

1704
01:10:01,340 --> 01:10:03,410
uh,
they stitch the dog up and then they

1705
01:10:03,411 --> 01:10:06,800
fall,
literally follow a blood trail up into

1706
01:10:06,801 --> 01:10:10,460
the hills where he finds nine dead
coyote,

1707
01:10:11,220 --> 01:10:15,440
his pit bull.
They lured him in and then the coyotes

1708
01:10:15,441 --> 01:10:18,910
ambushed him and he killed the mall.
It's,

1709
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:20,140
he goes,
it was like Homie,

1710
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:21,290
right?
That exactly.

1711
01:10:21,980 --> 01:10:23,720
It was like Vietnam,
dude.

1712
01:10:23,721 --> 01:10:26,060
He was like,
just next ripped open guts,

1713
01:10:26,061 --> 01:10:28,100
torn apart.
Arm snapped off.

1714
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:29,031
He goes,
this,

1715
01:10:29,031 --> 01:10:33,590
this pit bull just killed the pitbull
had a head like a fucking fire and their

1716
01:10:33,591 --> 01:10:34,650
muscles are in their head.

1717
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:35,900
Yeah.
It was a monster.

1718
01:10:35,901 --> 01:10:37,970
Don't I had my ear bitten off by one?
Yeah.

1719
01:10:38,410 --> 01:10:41,030
It happened so fucking fast.
I didn't,

1720
01:10:41,090 --> 01:10:44,150
I didn't feel anything.
Then you said it didn't mean mean to do

1721
01:10:44,151 --> 01:10:45,550
it.
Just paint didn't mean it.

1722
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:46,990
It was like it,
it does.

1723
01:10:46,991 --> 01:10:48,990
I don't have to defend it if we talked
about it on the vodcasts.

1724
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:49,761
Right.
So it's like,

1725
01:10:49,761 --> 01:10:53,360
but I just go fucking fast.
I didn't even feel it.

1726
01:10:53,361 --> 01:10:55,980
I felt no pain.
That's how fucking precise it was.

1727
01:10:56,020 --> 01:10:58,160
So they say about shark bites,
then you don't,

1728
01:10:58,220 --> 01:11:00,770
you don't feel the shark bite until you
realize your legs missing.

1729
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:04,940
That girl Bethany,
she said it was like an orgasm.

1730
01:11:04,941 --> 01:11:08,300
It was like bliss cause so much dopamine
rushes to the area so that you keep

1731
01:11:08,301 --> 01:11:10,170
fighting like it actually felt good
thing.

1732
01:11:10,220 --> 01:11:12,740
I'm comfortable about a 13 year old
talking about orgasms.

1733
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:13,980
Oh God,
we're going

1734
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:15,580
to jail.
We're going to jail.

1735
01:11:17,370 --> 01:11:18,600
Maybe I'm,
maybe you're,

1736
01:11:18,601 --> 01:11:21,150
maybe I'm putting that in there cause I
want to fuck a shark.

1737
01:11:23,220 --> 01:11:24,210
Sorry.
Don't see me play.

1738
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:28,250
I do feel myself walking on egg shells
around anything sexual all the time.

1739
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:31,140
Now a woman,
I would say this right now,

1740
01:11:31,141 --> 01:11:34,020
you can say whatever the fucking next,
you know women are next and they

1741
01:11:34,021 --> 01:11:35,140
shouldn't be.
They should,

1742
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:38,940
if women are predators and using their
power to coerce people,

1743
01:11:38,941 --> 01:11:40,590
they should.
If you see my Harvey Weinstein bit,

1744
01:11:40,620 --> 01:11:41,540
you haven't seen it?
No.

1745
01:11:41,541 --> 01:11:42,040
Okay.
I'll,

1746
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:42,873
I'll,
I'll,

1747
01:11:42,990 --> 01:11:44,400
I'll see you Wednesday.
Yeah.

1748
01:11:44,430 --> 01:11:45,241
Wednesday.
Yeah,

1749
01:11:45,241 --> 01:11:47,250
for sure.
But I don't,

1750
01:11:47,370 --> 01:11:49,080
that's,
that's nonsense.

1751
01:11:49,270 --> 01:11:50,220
Any God,
well,

1752
01:11:50,490 --> 01:11:52,620
there are,
I know guys that have been victimized by

1753
01:11:52,621 --> 01:11:54,030
women at work.
It was a guy,

1754
01:11:54,031 --> 01:11:56,430
a tj.
Remember the amazing atheist was telling

1755
01:11:56,431 --> 01:11:58,120
the story about the woman that he worked
with.

1756
01:11:58,121 --> 01:12:00,060
Zoe's always grabbing his ass and making
them uncomfortable.

1757
01:12:00,060 --> 01:12:04,320
And she was like his boss.
He was real socially awkward and in this

1758
01:12:04,321 --> 01:12:07,110
fucked up situation.
But that's super rare.

1759
01:12:07,260 --> 01:12:09,210
And I think that this is a balancing
thing.

1760
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:09,991
And then this,
this,

1761
01:12:09,991 --> 01:12:11,370
uh,
you don't want to thought it was the

1762
01:12:11,371 --> 01:12:15,030
most hilarious thing about the women's
march that um,

1763
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:20,120
people were angry that these white women
were wearing pink pussy hats because not

1764
01:12:20,941 --> 01:12:24,990
all women have the justice because not
all women have vaginas because there's

1765
01:12:24,991 --> 01:12:27,000
trans women.
No,

1766
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:29,490
women have that too because women of
color,

1767
01:12:29,491 --> 01:12:32,580
it's both their offensive to women of
color and Trans Women.

1768
01:12:33,050 --> 01:12:35,590
How many trans women were marching in
the women's March and

1769
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:40,470
I didn't know they were trans based on
their appearance.

1770
01:12:40,471 --> 01:12:42,900
Calm Down Internet.
I know them personally,

1771
01:12:42,901 --> 01:12:45,030
so I knew that they would train and
Bluto oh,

1772
01:12:45,570 --> 01:12:49,950
sniff them out for
this fucking dude.

1773
01:12:51,570 --> 01:12:54,870
I'm a comedian.
There was a thread on my twitter that I

1774
01:12:54,871 --> 01:12:59,400
wasn't even involved with where these
trans people and these lesbians were

1775
01:12:59,401 --> 01:13:04,401
going at it back and forth and it was
fascinating because lesbians are one of

1776
01:13:04,981 --> 01:13:09,180
the few groups that don't feel
intimidated to talk shit to trans

1777
01:13:09,181 --> 01:13:09,780
people.

1778
01:13:09,780 --> 01:13:12,870
They're like [inaudible] against the,
yeah,

1779
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:16,410
and they were saying that these trans
people are homophobic and these trans

1780
01:13:16,411 --> 01:13:18,390
women can't get it.
It was fucking crazy.

1781
01:13:18,391 --> 01:13:21,480
It was for days,
for seven or eight days that we're going

1782
01:13:21,481 --> 01:13:24,090
at it back and forth,
but essentially the Trans Women,

1783
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:26,850
this is what the lesbians were saying,
that the va,

1784
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:29,350
the violence,
the intersection,

1785
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:32,490
no,
it's not the way you know the violence

1786
01:13:32,491 --> 01:13:34,710
between women,
women on women,

1787
01:13:34,711 --> 01:13:37,230
violence in relationships,
domestic violence.

1788
01:13:37,670 --> 01:13:42,670
The statistics were skewed because a lot
of it is trans women that were attacking

1789
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:48,120
women that they were in relationships
with because these women that are trans

1790
01:13:48,121 --> 01:13:50,910
women,
they have the same behavior that men

1791
01:13:50,911 --> 01:13:53,190
have,
which the inclination towards domestic

1792
01:13:53,191 --> 01:13:55,650
violence check.
And so they were saying that and she was

1793
01:13:55,651 --> 01:13:59,720
citing statistics about how many of
these women that were the,

1794
01:13:59,721 --> 01:14:02,040
the,
the victimizers were not,

1795
01:14:02,220 --> 01:14:06,120
they weren't,
they would not specify their gender at

1796
01:14:06,121 --> 01:14:07,650
birth.
They were talking about their current

1797
01:14:07,651 --> 01:14:09,690
gender in,
which is like a weird thing now.

1798
01:14:09,691 --> 01:14:12,010
You don't have to like,
you could arrested if you're a

1799
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:15,040
trans woman for beating up a woman and
they will say,

1800
01:14:15,041 --> 01:14:16,330
okay,
well you're a woman.

1801
01:14:16,570 --> 01:14:17,261
And they'll say,
yes,

1802
01:14:17,261 --> 01:14:19,400
I am a woman.
You're born a woman,

1803
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:21,010
right?
It's none of your fucking business.

1804
01:14:21,011 --> 01:14:21,431
Like,
oh,

1805
01:14:21,431 --> 01:14:25,360
okay.
So there was this really deep,

1806
01:14:25,390 --> 01:14:29,230
that's fascinating because one of these
lesbians had started this with these

1807
01:14:29,231 --> 01:14:32,850
trans women was very educated about
these statistics and was,

1808
01:14:32,860 --> 01:14:35,920
was attacking these trans women.
And she was saying essentially like,

1809
01:14:35,921 --> 01:14:40,090
don't go round and say,
because you've been a woman for a

1810
01:14:40,090 --> 01:14:42,310
fucking year and a half,
they understand the struggle fuck off.

1811
01:14:42,330 --> 01:14:43,810
Right,
right.

1812
01:14:43,870 --> 01:14:47,590
And because you were just had male
privilege two years ago or whatever,

1813
01:14:47,591 --> 01:14:50,140
and you've had it your whole life.
What was that video that um,

1814
01:14:50,170 --> 01:14:51,430
that God,
that Comedians,

1815
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:55,750
it's so I ran into him yesterday.
Kyle.

1816
01:14:55,751 --> 01:14:56,584
Don again.
Yeah.

1817
01:14:56,590 --> 01:14:58,450
I ran into,
on his twitter page.

1818
01:14:58,510 --> 01:15:01,320
I raise a thing that he did with,
uh,

1819
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:02,470
with,
no,

1820
01:15:02,670 --> 01:15:04,870
it was bruce.
No,

1821
01:15:05,190 --> 01:15:07,480
Caitlyn Jenner.
Caitlyn Jenner.

1822
01:15:09,340 --> 01:15:11,000
Fuck.
That can change.

1823
01:15:11,001 --> 01:15:14,890
And I'm coming in here.
There's no pc shit allowed in here at

1824
01:15:14,891 --> 01:15:16,150
all.
Um,

1825
01:15:16,180 --> 01:15:17,150
but uh,
this,

1826
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:18,610
this is it.
Hold on please.

1827
01:15:18,611 --> 01:15:22,030
Select from the beginning and give me
some volume so it will hold up before

1828
01:15:22,031 --> 01:15:23,500
you play it.
Before you play it.

1829
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:25,570
No,
this is,

1830
01:15:25,571 --> 01:15:28,240
um,
so kyle dunning,

1831
01:15:28,330 --> 01:15:30,070
how'd he say his name?
Donald again.

1832
01:15:30,100 --> 01:15:31,360
Dot.
Kyle done again.

1833
01:15:31,570 --> 01:15:36,040
Did a face swap with Kim Kardashians and
Caitlyn Jenner.

1834
01:15:36,220 --> 01:15:37,180
And so,
uh,

1835
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:39,160
take it from the beginning.
It's,

1836
01:15:40,450 --> 01:15:41,283
it's a,

1837
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:43,230
hey,
how about this women's movement?

1838
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:46,310
Ha Hr turn now baby.

1839
01:15:48,170 --> 01:15:50,960
You lived as a man.
Most of you had the bay [inaudible]

1840
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:55,820
few sheer ish.
Bruce used to make me touch his penis

1841
01:15:55,821 --> 01:15:57,430
till he climaxed.
Yeah,

1842
01:15:57,740 --> 01:15:59,320
Time's up.
Me Too.

1843
01:16:01,790 --> 01:16:04,070
That was the you though.
Oh,

1844
01:16:04,071 --> 01:16:05,720
nice.
Can blame the Becca mentioned.

1845
01:16:05,721 --> 01:16:07,070
Nice.
What's your next question?

1846
01:16:07,071 --> 01:16:09,920
What was I wearing age?
Are you weighing?

1847
01:16:09,921 --> 01:16:13,160
It's super cat,
right Dash Donna Karan.

1848
01:16:13,161 --> 01:16:15,830
800 bucks.
That's right.

1849
01:16:15,860 --> 01:16:17,380
Fuck yeah,
it was worth it.

1850
01:16:18,010 --> 01:16:19,270
That's it.
But fuck.

1851
01:16:19,271 --> 01:16:21,870
Where did you find out his whatever.
Um,

1852
01:16:21,930 --> 01:16:22,780
no.
His instagram,

1853
01:16:22,781 --> 01:16:25,300
somebody sent it to me.
I think that's his twitter,

1854
01:16:25,450 --> 01:16:27,450
but somebody sent it to me on his
instagram page.

1855
01:16:27,451 --> 01:16:29,650
He does that.
I don't know him,

1856
01:16:29,651 --> 01:16:31,770
but he does a bunch of these in their
fucking hilarious.

1857
01:16:31,771 --> 01:16:32,604
Yeah.
He wrote,

1858
01:16:32,710 --> 01:16:35,330
he wrote an Amy Schumer's show.
It's really funny.

1859
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:36,141
Really funny.
Hey,

1860
01:16:36,141 --> 01:16:38,620
do you remember back in the day he,
that cow comfort he did that cow

1861
01:16:38,621 --> 01:16:41,140
commercial back in the day was a chick
filet or something where he was like

1862
01:16:41,141 --> 01:16:43,030
dancing with a cow.
Do you know what I'm talking about?

1863
01:16:43,031 --> 01:16:46,510
We don't have to play that.
I come up with Chuck Blakeman.

1864
01:16:47,010 --> 01:16:48,220
Um,
but I just mean like,

1865
01:16:48,221 --> 01:16:49,360
it was something funny.
He's,

1866
01:16:49,450 --> 01:16:51,400
he's funny.
He's a tricep chick filet yesterday.

1867
01:16:51,580 --> 01:16:55,810
Why do you eat fast food occasionally on
Sundays.

1868
01:16:55,930 --> 01:16:57,370
Chicks please.
Fucking delicious.

1869
01:16:57,371 --> 01:16:59,530
But it's going to be too,
but I couldn't go on Sunday.

1870
01:16:59,531 --> 01:17:01,360
Terrible for you.
Five guys.

1871
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:03,670
It's by,
can't use on Sunday because they are

1872
01:17:03,671 --> 01:17:04,960
open.
Oh baby.

1873
01:17:04,961 --> 01:17:08,620
Jesus.
Chick-Fil-A shit is fucking super

1874
01:17:08,621 --> 01:17:11,120
religious.
I'm going to go have an abortion in the

1875
01:17:11,121 --> 01:17:13,240
chick filet bathroom.
Don't do that.

1876
01:17:13,241 --> 01:17:15,470
Do you think that would upset any money
or we,

1877
01:17:15,471 --> 01:17:16,850
yeah,
I feel like I heard we're not supposed

1878
01:17:16,851 --> 01:17:19,520
to eat a chick flick into that you can't
eat anymore.

1879
01:17:22,010 --> 01:17:23,570
I was somewhere the other the other day
and I was like,

1880
01:17:23,571 --> 01:17:24,291
oh,
let's go to this restaurant.

1881
01:17:24,291 --> 01:17:24,891
They were like,
we can't.

1882
01:17:24,891 --> 01:17:26,270
That's a Mario Batali restaurant.
I was like,

1883
01:17:26,271 --> 01:17:29,960
I'll buck and can everyone stop raping
people so I can eat my favorite pasta

1884
01:17:30,140 --> 01:17:32,060
problem?
Monique telling everybody to boycott

1885
01:17:32,061 --> 01:17:34,610
netflix crazy hard.
I mean,

1886
01:17:34,611 --> 01:17:39,280
that's insane when we getting a half a
million dollars for an hour,

1887
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:42,470
but it's like Mo,
for most people that's like good at Sane

1888
01:17:42,471 --> 01:17:44,420
fucking amount.
I mean that's an insane amount of money

1889
01:17:44,870 --> 01:17:47,510
as her comparing herself to Chris Rock's
not relatable,

1890
01:17:49,730 --> 01:17:54,200
she's not as famous.
There's a scale and pay disparity stuff

1891
01:17:54,201 --> 01:17:57,100
is tricky because if you get paid based
on the value that you bring,

1892
01:17:57,101 --> 01:17:59,330
you know else was going on that Kathy
Griffin,

1893
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:01,270
Kathy Griffin was saying something about
Ib.

1894
01:18:01,430 --> 01:18:06,430
She did 23 standup shows,
23 standing ovations,

1895
01:18:08,340 --> 01:18:10,850
do a special,
she would be willing to do a special

1896
01:18:10,851 --> 01:18:12,920
bunch,
wants to make sure she gets equal pay

1897
01:18:13,130 --> 01:18:17,720
for equal pay for women and she was
making it a part of that like say no and

1898
01:18:17,721 --> 01:18:18,440
go somewhere else.

1899
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:20,000
You know,
there's so many outlets now.

1900
01:18:20,001 --> 01:18:21,240
There's Apps,
there's fucking hoot.

1901
01:18:21,270 --> 01:18:22,890
There's so many places.
Just say no.

1902
01:18:23,270 --> 01:18:25,610
Here's the thing.
They pay you what they think.

1903
01:18:25,670 --> 01:18:29,900
It's worth it based on how popular you
are and based on how popular your

1904
01:18:29,910 --> 01:18:32,130
standup is based on what they think they
can get out.

1905
01:18:32,730 --> 01:18:33,231
Yeah.
I mean,

1906
01:18:33,231 --> 01:18:36,260
that's why Dave Chappelle gets the most,
that's why Amy Schumer got a lot.

1907
01:18:36,410 --> 01:18:39,600
She was selling out
arenas.

1908
01:18:39,670 --> 01:18:42,200
Monique's not doing that.
So for her to compare herself to those

1909
01:18:42,201 --> 01:18:44,330
two people,
it's fucking crazy angry and she's

1910
01:18:44,510 --> 01:18:48,650
basing it on her tickets,
like are their box office for movies

1911
01:18:48,651 --> 01:18:49,790
that she was in like,
Whoa,

1912
01:18:49,791 --> 01:18:50,300
Whoa,
whoa.

1913
01:18:50,300 --> 01:18:52,700
It's like you're not just getting paid
that amount.

1914
01:18:52,701 --> 01:18:54,800
You're getting paid when the special
areas that tickets are going to sell

1915
01:18:54,801 --> 01:18:58,910
because that's special.
It's streaming so crazy when they start

1916
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:00,660
to boycott,
you need to book,

1917
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:01,640
we need to boycott.

1918
01:19:03,050 --> 01:19:06,800
Netflix.
Could the head of Netflix who openly

1919
01:19:06,860 --> 01:19:10,370
lynch someone and not one person would
stop watching that?

1920
01:19:12,330 --> 01:19:14,540
They were in trouble though with the
Kevin Spacey thing.

1921
01:19:14,541 --> 01:19:17,240
They had to do something about that and
they did and they did.

1922
01:19:17,670 --> 01:19:18,920
They lost a lot of money on it.
Yeah.

1923
01:19:18,950 --> 01:19:20,410
They lost 39 million bucks.
Yeah.

1924
01:19:20,510 --> 01:19:24,560
Between that,
the Kevin Spacey thing,

1925
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:26,880
they
rebel.

1926
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:28,340
Yeah,
I saw them when we were,

1927
01:19:28,341 --> 01:19:29,230
when we were there.
Yeah.

1928
01:19:29,231 --> 01:19:31,370
Well,
that was where Gore vidal used to go to

1929
01:19:31,371 --> 01:19:34,880
bank dudes.
But I feel like that it had to get this

1930
01:19:34,881 --> 01:19:36,490
bad for people to be like,
you know what,

1931
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:38,100
we're not going to hire these people
because it's going to,

1932
01:19:38,270 --> 01:19:41,270
it has to be like a bottom line issue.
Like I'm not going to hire a rapist

1933
01:19:41,271 --> 01:19:43,160
because it's too expensive.
Have you ever seen the Gore Vidal

1934
01:19:43,161 --> 01:19:44,570
William F.
Buckley documentary?

1935
01:19:44,900 --> 01:19:47,890
We're a details.
No,

1936
01:19:48,010 --> 01:19:48,210
no.

1937
01:19:48,210 --> 01:19:49,550
The opposite.
They hated each other.

1938
01:19:49,970 --> 01:19:50,900
William F.
Buckley was,

1939
01:19:52,330 --> 01:19:57,330
he was a British conservative guy who
was very popular during the day and this

1940
01:19:57,831 --> 01:20:01,790
is from the 1960s on television.
And they were debating back and forth.

1941
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:03,500
Gore Vidal and William F.
Buckley,

1942
01:20:04,550 --> 01:20:07,890
liberal versus conservative,
but like on national television.

1943
01:20:07,891 --> 01:20:12,390
And it was like these really contentious
highly charged debates and it kind of

1944
01:20:12,391 --> 01:20:16,620
sunk William f Buckley's career.
Cause at one time Gore Vidal called him

1945
01:20:16,621 --> 01:20:19,470
a Nazi.
You called them a neo Nazi or something.

1946
01:20:19,471 --> 01:20:22,680
Something along those lines.
And then go William F.

1947
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:25,080
Buckley said something called him a
fucking queer and I'll,

1948
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:28,290
I'll punch your face up,
a sock you in your nose.

1949
01:20:28,291 --> 01:20:32,220
And you'll stay plastered,
like lost his cool on television called

1950
01:20:32,221 --> 01:20:36,720
them a queer on television and it was
like this whoa moment and William f

1951
01:20:36,721 --> 01:20:41,400
Buckley's career,
you get to see who really is.

1952
01:20:41,401 --> 01:20:44,100
Yeah.
You pressured like I love thinking about

1953
01:20:44,101 --> 01:20:46,110
what in 30 years or when we look back
and be like,

1954
01:20:46,111 --> 01:20:47,880
Yo,
I can't believe we used just fucking say

1955
01:20:47,881 --> 01:20:48,300
that.

1956
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:51,020
You know like retard.
We used to just say retard,

1957
01:20:54,140 --> 01:20:59,140
but only the retards but not
just the human who does the word is not

1958
01:21:01,350 --> 01:21:05,370
the word is retarded means like to slow
the growth of something.

1959
01:21:06,690 --> 01:21:10,890
Retarded ideas,
you know like or like like okay,

1960
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:13,930
like denying someone birth control.
That is retarded.

1961
01:21:14,060 --> 01:21:16,020
Retarded.
It's like socially retarded.

1962
01:21:16,510 --> 01:21:18,120
Tiding,
slowing progress.

1963
01:21:18,130 --> 01:21:19,680
Yes.
I don't think that's a bad word.

1964
01:21:19,780 --> 01:21:21,930
Yeah.
What I think is a bad thing is to mock

1965
01:21:21,931 --> 01:21:25,050
someone who has a disability,
but I don't think that you're always

1966
01:21:25,051 --> 01:21:26,760
talking about that when you're saying
that word.

1967
01:21:27,390 --> 01:21:29,760
I think we have a real problem with
language policing.

1968
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:34,260
I think we have a real problem with
denying the use of sounds there.

1969
01:21:34,270 --> 01:21:36,450
So this is what a word supposed to be.
It's like you make a noise.

1970
01:21:36,510 --> 01:21:38,730
So I understand what you're saying.
I understand.

1971
01:21:38,750 --> 01:21:40,530
Like there's,
there has to be context.

1972
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:44,040
Like I understand I have to,
it's supposed to be a sound that you

1973
01:21:44,041 --> 01:21:49,041
make so I can understand what you're
trying to convey and that's retarded.

1974
01:21:49,051 --> 01:21:50,670
And I go,
you mean,

1975
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:53,100
you know,
that's missing a chromosome,

1976
01:21:53,430 --> 01:21:54,151
you know,
like,

1977
01:21:54,151 --> 01:21:54,661
it's like,
well,

1978
01:21:54,661 --> 01:21:56,560
that would be me saying that's down
syndrome though.

1979
01:21:56,970 --> 01:21:57,600
Oh,
that's true.

1980
01:21:57,600 --> 01:21:58,720
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.

1981
01:21:59,300 --> 01:22:00,810
I think it's figuring out what the
ideology is.

1982
01:22:00,890 --> 01:22:03,030
The word I did not know this happened
recently.

1983
01:22:03,031 --> 01:22:04,800
Someone said in a writer's room,
um,

1984
01:22:04,950 --> 01:22:08,460
she's uppity.
I did not know that that was a slave

1985
01:22:08,461 --> 01:22:10,740
term.
We all learned very quickly that that

1986
01:22:10,741 --> 01:22:12,340
was a term,
that's what it means.

1987
01:22:12,350 --> 01:22:14,610
Yes.
The ideology of it was to describe a

1988
01:22:14,611 --> 01:22:19,290
slave that was acting out and we learn,
oh wow.

1989
01:22:19,291 --> 01:22:21,570
I always thought up,
but he was someone who is like a high

1990
01:22:21,571 --> 01:22:23,400
Falutin like,
uh,

1991
01:22:23,430 --> 01:22:24,690
you know,
some rich person.

1992
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:28,140
I thought it was just someone who is um,
or council Trent and would not

1993
01:22:28,141 --> 01:22:31,710
participate or who is resisting,
but it's actually has origins in it.

1994
01:22:31,711 --> 01:22:36,240
Same with like patty wagon is like
offensive to Irish people cause it used

1995
01:22:36,241 --> 01:22:38,870
to describe drunk Irish people.
Irish people don't care.

1996
01:22:38,900 --> 01:22:42,950
Trust me in one quarter of course it's
like non Irish people are the ones who

1997
01:22:42,951 --> 01:22:45,390
were offended and funny that one quarter
Irish,

1998
01:22:45,420 --> 01:22:48,360
I can't really say I'm Irish,
but if I was one quarter black I'd be,

1999
01:22:48,450 --> 01:22:53,040
you would be forever fucking Afro.
I would be a part of the community.

2000
01:22:53,070 --> 01:22:57,090
And then what's the other one?
There was another one under your thumb.

2001
01:22:57,150 --> 01:22:59,460
If you have someone under your thumb.
It's a rolling stones song.

2002
01:22:59,930 --> 01:23:02,550
But it was,
it used to be that was the thickness of

2003
01:23:02,551 --> 01:23:03,960
a switch that you could hit your wife
with.

2004
01:23:03,961 --> 01:23:06,020
It had to be,
it couldn't thicker than your thumb.

2005
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:07,710
Yeah.
Like there's the,

2006
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:09,750
like the,
is it ediology or etymology?

2007
01:23:10,060 --> 01:23:11,690
Etymology of,
um,

2008
01:23:11,740 --> 01:23:12,790
those words,
which I just did.

2009
01:23:12,791 --> 01:23:13,950
No.
Um,

2010
01:23:14,170 --> 01:23:17,050
do you know the term faggot where that
came from?

2011
01:23:17,230 --> 01:23:18,820
Uh,
cigarettes?

2012
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:20,010
No,
that's,

2013
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:21,753
oh,
that's right.

2014
01:23:22,060 --> 01:23:25,000
And do you know,
why did it turn into gay slur?

2015
01:23:25,060 --> 01:23:27,730
This is,
this will piss me off on Louis ck show.

2016
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:33,120
They use this urban myth that what it
meant was that a bundle of sticks was a

2017
01:23:34,751 --> 01:23:37,990
faggot.
And so I'm a gay man was a faggot cause

2018
01:23:37,991 --> 01:23:40,570
they were a bundle of sticks and you
would burn them in a fire.

2019
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:44,140
That's not true at all.
Did he know that?

2020
01:23:44,380 --> 01:23:46,960
I don't know.
It's convenient to ignore.

2021
01:23:47,100 --> 01:23:48,910
Oh you got to do is research.
It's not hard.

2022
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:52,830
What a bundle of sticks was referred to
was a burden.

2023
01:23:52,831 --> 01:23:55,660
Some woman they would call a burdensome
woman,

2024
01:23:55,661 --> 01:23:58,390
a faggot because she was like a bundle
of sticks.

2025
01:23:58,660 --> 01:24:01,510
Very difficult to carry around.
It'd be awkward.

2026
01:24:01,690 --> 01:24:06,690
So a man who act like a woman was a fac.
Whoa.

2027
01:24:06,820 --> 01:24:09,070
That's what the term meant.
That's where it came from.

2028
01:24:09,240 --> 01:24:12,850
That's the no idea.
That's the absolute origins of that

2029
01:24:12,851 --> 01:24:16,210
term.
So when people say there was a gay guy

2030
01:24:16,211 --> 01:24:18,910
and Louis ck show that was saying that,
and I was,

2031
01:24:19,060 --> 01:24:22,450
it was him and Nick Depalo and Louie
were all playing cards together and

2032
01:24:22,451 --> 01:24:25,540
someone said some faggot.
And you realize why that's so offensive

2033
01:24:25,690 --> 01:24:26,560
is because,
you know,

2034
01:24:26,680 --> 01:24:29,830
they used to burn people.
There's no fucking history of gay people

2035
01:24:29,831 --> 01:24:31,500
being burned like witches.
You,

2036
01:24:31,510 --> 01:24:33,280
by the way,
even the Salem witch trials,

2037
01:24:33,460 --> 01:24:35,290
they didn't burn witches.
They drown them.

2038
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:39,010
They drowned them and dogs.
This is how fucking insane the hysteria

2039
01:24:39,170 --> 01:24:41,680
around the dogs.
Two dogs in the Salem witch trials,

2040
01:24:41,681 --> 01:24:44,260
there were dogs were witches live is
mass hysteria.

2041
01:24:44,290 --> 01:24:45,790
Do you know why they think they did
that?

2042
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:48,900
Why they think what,
why?

2043
01:24:48,910 --> 01:24:51,350
The whole witch trial thing happened.
Um,

2044
01:24:51,980 --> 01:24:55,690
uh,
religious fanaticism or got there was a

2045
01:24:55,691 --> 01:25:00,430
late frost and this has been proven by
core samples of the ground.

2046
01:25:00,431 --> 01:25:03,160
They had a late frost.
And when you have a late frost on wheat,

2047
01:25:03,490 --> 01:25:06,430
one of the things that happens is
bacterial growth on the wheat.

2048
01:25:06,980 --> 01:25:09,100
It re,
it essentially,

2049
01:25:09,130 --> 01:25:14,130
Ergo is very similar to lysergic acid,
very similar to lsd and cows were dying

2050
01:25:16,631 --> 01:25:17,280
and shit.
Right?

2051
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:19,390
And they thought it was like witchcraft.
Well,

2052
01:25:19,420 --> 01:25:20,890
yeah,
there's a little bit of that,

2053
01:25:20,891 --> 01:25:25,891
but that could have been another symbol.
I'll just diseases hepatitis back.

2054
01:25:26,060 --> 01:25:30,190
But ergo is a psychedelic.
And so these people were literally on

2055
01:25:30,191 --> 01:25:34,030
acid and they were freaking the fuck out
thinking they were being heckled by

2056
01:25:34,031 --> 01:25:37,000
witches and they're paranoid was in
their mind.

2057
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Women,
why didn't they think men were being

2058
01:25:40,001 --> 01:25:41,470
witches as well?
I guess a couple of men,

2059
01:25:41,530 --> 01:25:44,410
men did die but and babies,
they kill a couple of babies.

2060
01:25:44,411 --> 01:25:46,660
She's just cries,
lost their fucking minds while they were

2061
01:25:46,661 --> 01:25:48,400
on acid.
But I think,

2062
01:25:48,401 --> 01:25:51,100
you know,
given the situation when men are in a

2063
01:25:51,101 --> 01:25:53,770
position of power,
which they almost always wore back then

2064
01:25:53,830 --> 01:25:57,490
and then something's happening to them,
they would go for the weakest thing,

2065
01:25:57,491 --> 01:26:01,960
which is probably a woman or a single
woman or a woman is weird in any way.

2066
01:26:01,961 --> 01:26:04,160
And just like that bitch.
I mean it's also just

2067
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:05,390
that sort of annoying that now people
look,

2068
01:26:05,420 --> 01:26:06,980
this is a witch hunt,
this is a witch hunt.

2069
01:26:07,010 --> 01:26:08,690
Like,
without even knowing that that word is

2070
01:26:08,691 --> 01:26:12,470
actually something to describe when men
use to hunt women and now they're using

2071
01:26:12,471 --> 01:26:15,230
it as a way cause it's like,
I mean,

2072
01:26:15,260 --> 01:26:16,760
you know,
men thinking that we're like hunting

2073
01:26:16,761 --> 01:26:18,050
them or it's some kind of like mccarthy

2074
01:26:18,190 --> 01:26:19,030
I'm or something.
Yeah.

2075
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:21,650
We'll witch hunt.
The idea is that you're looking for

2076
01:26:21,651 --> 01:26:23,670
something that's not really their
exactly.

2077
01:26:23,750 --> 01:26:24,770
Yeah,
exactly.

2078
01:26:24,771 --> 01:26:25,604
Yeah.
You know,

2079
01:26:25,670 --> 01:26:28,990
and I guess I just don't know a lot of
people who are doing then.

2080
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:32,240
Yeah,
I think there's a real problem we have,

2081
01:26:32,241 --> 01:26:35,800
like we said earlier about tribalism,
about being on trial,

2082
01:26:36,220 --> 01:26:37,610
naming.
It's a mass shaming.

2083
01:26:37,611 --> 01:26:40,580
When did you say there's definitely that
going on for sure.

2084
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:44,480
But I'm saying what I'm saying is that
people identifying with all women or men

2085
01:26:44,481 --> 01:26:46,090
identifying with all men.
Yeah.

2086
01:26:46,260 --> 01:26:48,830
Like especially man,
I did it like I had this bit that I was

2087
01:26:48,831 --> 01:26:51,710
doing for awhile about um,
a bumper sticker that I saw in a car.

2088
01:26:51,980 --> 01:26:53,550
It said girls kick ass.
No,

2089
01:26:53,570 --> 01:26:56,180
it was like,
I hate that shit.

2090
01:26:56,181 --> 01:26:57,240
Some of them,
I,

2091
01:26:57,530 --> 01:26:59,420
some of them are lazy and even,
I mean,

2092
01:26:59,570 --> 01:27:00,880
we're getting into this too.
Have you seen the bit,

2093
01:27:00,881 --> 01:27:03,560
I do point.
The point is you can never have that

2094
01:27:03,561 --> 01:27:05,630
about men.
Like a guy have a bumper sticker that

2095
01:27:05,631 --> 01:27:08,330
said boys kick ass and be like,
pull the fuck over.

2096
01:27:08,350 --> 01:27:09,260
Yeah.
What are you doing?

2097
01:27:09,290 --> 01:27:11,840
Yeah.
What's in your car?

2098
01:27:11,930 --> 01:27:16,280
So yes,
I do have a lot of girlfriends who are

2099
01:27:16,281 --> 01:27:18,650
conflating,
you know,

2100
01:27:18,651 --> 01:27:20,490
empowerment with entitlement.
Hmm.

2101
01:27:20,620 --> 01:27:23,150
I it totally get it.
And I have a lot of girlfriends who

2102
01:27:23,151 --> 01:27:25,100
think they're feminists and they're
actually just assholes.

2103
01:27:25,101 --> 01:27:27,590
Like I have that,
I talk about this a little bit.

2104
01:27:27,591 --> 01:27:29,870
It's real right on stage.
If a couple of girlfriends who are like,

2105
01:27:30,260 --> 01:27:32,450
I need a man of respect me.
And in many respect me,

2106
01:27:32,451 --> 01:27:32,841
I'm like,
bitch,

2107
01:27:32,841 --> 01:27:36,470
you need to get those photos of you and
tank tops that say Rosie all day off

2108
01:27:36,471 --> 01:27:38,720
your fucking instagram before we have
this conversation.

2109
01:27:38,930 --> 01:27:41,870
Or not recognize who you are or,
but like I,

2110
01:27:41,871 --> 01:27:43,970
you know,
you then earn my respect.

2111
01:27:43,971 --> 01:27:46,010
You know,
you don't automatically get respect just

2112
01:27:46,011 --> 01:27:47,990
because you're a woman.
That's entitlement.

2113
01:27:48,020 --> 01:27:49,670
You know,
you still have to like watch a fucking

2114
01:27:49,671 --> 01:27:51,270
Ted talk and read a book every now and
then.

2115
01:27:51,290 --> 01:27:54,020
Like you still have to like be cool and
know what you're talking about.

2116
01:27:54,290 --> 01:27:55,550
So it's like,
you know,

2117
01:27:55,551 --> 01:27:55,851
I,
I,

2118
01:27:55,851 --> 01:27:57,200
there's definitely some duds.

2119
01:27:57,700 --> 01:27:58,830
Well,
there's people that are,

2120
01:27:58,910 --> 01:28:01,770
you know,
they're now on the team that's attacking

2121
01:28:02,730 --> 01:28:04,210
and there's a tribal like,
yeah,

2122
01:28:04,230 --> 01:28:07,750
this is no different than someone like
the Patriots were fucking kicking ass.

2123
01:28:07,790 --> 01:28:08,640
Yeah,
that's,

2124
01:28:08,670 --> 01:28:10,770
that's tribal too.
It's the same thing.

2125
01:28:10,771 --> 01:28:13,020
It's a natural inclination that people
have,

2126
01:28:13,110 --> 01:28:14,190
but it's also at the same time,
like,

2127
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:16,260
you know,
I think a lot of guys I've heard,

2128
01:28:16,261 --> 01:28:18,600
we look will,
you guys hate all men and you think all

2129
01:28:18,601 --> 01:28:19,470
men are assholes.
It's like,

2130
01:28:19,471 --> 01:28:21,960
for me it's actually the opposite.
I know a lot of really amazing men that

2131
01:28:21,961 --> 01:28:24,540
have cell phones stolen,
rich restraint that I'm comparing the

2132
01:28:24,541 --> 01:28:26,130
shitheads too.
You know,

2133
01:28:26,131 --> 01:28:27,120
like in your,
does

2134
01:28:27,130 --> 01:28:29,860
it say that though,
just or just what?

2135
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:31,660
They're scared.
They're guilty.

2136
01:28:31,690 --> 01:28:33,880
They're saying that you hate all men.
No,

2137
01:28:33,881 --> 01:28:35,070
I get the people who are like,
you,

2138
01:28:35,071 --> 01:28:37,180
are you bitter?
You know,

2139
01:28:37,181 --> 01:28:40,570
feminists that hate men,
like you can't even say that they're

2140
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:41,740
tribal.
Yeah.

2141
01:28:41,770 --> 01:28:43,640
You want to stand up for tribe.
Male.

2142
01:28:43,690 --> 01:28:45,760
Yeah.
Instead of just objectively looking at

2143
01:28:45,761 --> 01:28:46,840
this and well,
what's going on?

2144
01:28:46,841 --> 01:28:47,860
Well,
imagine being a woman,

2145
01:28:47,861 --> 01:28:49,540
man.
Imagine being a woman who's been working

2146
01:28:49,541 --> 01:28:50,420
in an office.
Yeah.

2147
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:52,210
And dealing with this shit all of your
life.

2148
01:28:52,240 --> 01:28:55,510
Imagine being a woman who's been raped.
Imagine being a woman who's been,

2149
01:28:55,570 --> 01:28:57,400
you know,
how to walk down the street past a bunch

2150
01:28:57,401 --> 01:29:00,910
of guys and they grabbed her ass and
harassed or learn about the neurological

2151
01:29:01,650 --> 01:29:02,070
of that,
that

2152
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:02,761
go on.
I,

2153
01:29:02,761 --> 01:29:06,090
he likes sometimes we can't speak out.
Sometimes we freeze like you said.

2154
01:29:06,390 --> 01:29:07,320
Um,
you know,

2155
01:29:07,321 --> 01:29:09,480
and I think it's just like nobody wants
to look into that research.

2156
01:29:09,560 --> 01:29:11,630
There are some women,
very few,

2157
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:14,330
but there are some women that hate men.
There are some men,

2158
01:29:14,730 --> 01:29:15,370
I want to say,

2159
01:29:15,370 --> 01:29:17,620
so don't pull gender is a trauma
response.

2160
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:20,550
Yeah.
That is a one person hurt me or a couple

2161
01:29:20,570 --> 01:29:24,040
people hurt me and I need to generalize
about all of them to give myself a false

2162
01:29:24,041 --> 01:29:26,320
sense of safety.
I have friends that have been divorced a

2163
01:29:26,321 --> 01:29:28,810
couple times and those are the trickiest
ones.

2164
01:29:29,110 --> 01:29:31,930
Cause those guys,
like they literally like they have this

2165
01:29:31,931 --> 01:29:34,720
idea that there's like a,
that the,

2166
01:29:34,930 --> 01:29:37,500
the women at the enemy and they take
your money and they,

2167
01:29:37,590 --> 01:29:41,890
they some new pretend they pretend they
like you and then eventually they turn

2168
01:29:41,891 --> 01:29:44,650
it on you and they get their lawyers and
they take your money and then I go,

2169
01:29:44,651 --> 01:29:47,410
what's going on with you that you keep
gravitating that woman.

2170
01:29:47,550 --> 01:29:48,580
Yeah.
That's my thing.

2171
01:29:48,581 --> 01:29:52,240
It's like what's going on with you that
you like you had no idea what people are

2172
01:29:52,241 --> 01:29:55,750
very different in the beginning of your
relationship with money is you people

2173
01:29:55,751 --> 01:29:58,480
have real personal sovereignty in the
beginning of a relationship.

2174
01:29:58,540 --> 01:30:00,400
I like interesting beginning of
relationship

2175
01:30:00,440 --> 01:30:03,020
you lock on like is this going to be the
person that makes me feel better about

2176
01:30:03,021 --> 01:30:06,020
life is just going to be the person that
brings me joy and this is going to be

2177
01:30:06,021 --> 01:30:09,320
the person that brings me lust and sex
and fun.

2178
01:30:10,070 --> 01:30:14,470
And then afterwards you get bored with
each other and then people get resentful

2179
01:30:14,500 --> 01:30:15,260
and Yup.
Yup.

2180
01:30:15,260 --> 01:30:17,010
And this is the thing about men with
money.

2181
01:30:17,060 --> 01:30:21,080
I've always said like when a man with
money as dating a woman who doesn't have

2182
01:30:21,081 --> 01:30:23,000
money,
then there's this weird dynamic like the

2183
01:30:23,001 --> 01:30:25,490
woman like it at first or some guys,
let me get it first.

2184
01:30:25,491 --> 01:30:26,390
Okay.
The man,

2185
01:30:26,450 --> 01:30:28,940
when the man with money is dating the
woman that doesn't have any money,

2186
01:30:29,210 --> 01:30:30,890
the woman is like,
Oh wow,

2187
01:30:30,891 --> 01:30:32,450
this guy's got money.
This is amazing.

2188
01:30:32,451 --> 01:30:36,860
But then when they get married,
she's got money to now it's like now

2189
01:30:36,861 --> 01:30:39,200
you're just another guy.
Like I'm a rich lady now.

2190
01:30:39,230 --> 01:30:40,970
Yeah.
Like now I have money,

2191
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:42,620
like gone fucking divorces,
dude,

2192
01:30:42,621 --> 01:30:43,454
I'm,
I'm bridge.

2193
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:44,371
Oh,
I see.

2194
01:30:44,371 --> 01:30:46,500
So,
and then there they get entitled the

2195
01:30:46,501 --> 01:30:47,950
money.
I would say I would never take money of

2196
01:30:47,951 --> 01:30:48,784
the guy of dating.

2197
01:30:49,080 --> 01:30:50,790
Well you had married.
That's different.

2198
01:30:50,850 --> 01:30:51,930
Yeah,
you're not,

2199
01:30:51,931 --> 01:30:54,180
I mean,
but that dynamic of the guy having all

2200
01:30:54,181 --> 01:30:56,610
the money and the woman being like a
waitress or something like that.

2201
01:30:56,611 --> 01:30:58,180
But that's a normal dynamic.
Yeah.

2202
01:30:58,500 --> 01:31:01,860
When it happens,
like men like it because like look at

2203
01:31:01,861 --> 01:31:02,581
me,
you know,

2204
01:31:02,581 --> 01:31:05,610
I have,
I'm so advanced in comparison to what

2205
01:31:05,611 --> 01:31:07,620
she had financially,
right where she is.

2206
01:31:07,770 --> 01:31:10,350
I have all these things that I can offer
her that she could never get on her own.

2207
01:31:10,460 --> 01:31:12,720
We've got to fly to Paris on a private
jet.

2208
01:31:12,721 --> 01:31:14,190
I'm going to blow your mind,
you know,

2209
01:31:14,191 --> 01:31:15,001
that kind of Shit,
right?

2210
01:31:15,001 --> 01:31:16,950
Yeah.
And then the woman marries his fucking

2211
01:31:16,951 --> 01:31:19,800
ass hole and then next thing you know
she is rich too.

2212
01:31:19,950 --> 01:31:24,630
She's got Gucci bags and a big diamond
and she's driving a Ferrari and she's

2213
01:31:24,631 --> 01:31:25,260
like,
you know what,

2214
01:31:25,260 --> 01:31:26,910
I don't want to suck this guy's Dick
Anymore.

2215
01:31:27,660 --> 01:31:29,280
I'm tired.
I'm tired of it.

2216
01:31:29,281 --> 01:31:31,830
I'm tired of the whole thing.
And then,

2217
01:31:31,860 --> 01:31:33,960
you know,
she's not impressed anymore because

2218
01:31:33,961 --> 01:31:37,500
she's wealthy too.
So she's not a wealthy guy anymore.

2219
01:31:37,950 --> 01:31:39,740
He's just a guy cause she's,
well

2220
01:31:39,980 --> 01:31:42,800
I see it there now equals and then he
doesn't have something that I can't

2221
01:31:43,370 --> 01:31:44,890
access on my own.
I don't need him anymore.

2222
01:31:45,190 --> 01:31:46,070
I don't,
I've never,

2223
01:31:46,071 --> 01:31:49,620
I don't,
I've not had money before and um,

2224
01:31:49,700 --> 01:31:52,670
I've been hungry and poor before.
I guess I get that,

2225
01:31:52,671 --> 01:31:54,910
but I don't know.
Maybe it's just maybe things are gonna

2226
01:31:54,930 --> 01:31:57,140
change in terms of like maybe we'll look
back and 40 years and be like,

2227
01:31:57,141 --> 01:32:00,160
remember when 40 olds you just used date
broke 20

2228
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:01,390
year olds.
Like,

2229
01:32:01,420 --> 01:32:03,880
I mean it's still going to have to
fight.

2230
01:32:03,881 --> 01:32:07,180
We're biologically wired.
You guys are biologically wired to want

2231
01:32:07,181 --> 01:32:08,014
to,
you know,

2232
01:32:08,140 --> 01:32:10,270
fuck women that are fertile.
I totally get that.

2233
01:32:10,810 --> 01:32:15,460
It might be a liability wired to want to
fuck successful or men that are,

2234
01:32:15,550 --> 01:32:19,360
that have their shit together.
They're more emotionally stable.

2235
01:32:19,361 --> 01:32:22,220
They're physically more together.
Yeah.

2236
01:32:22,300 --> 01:32:23,560
Are You my dad?
Are You my dad?

2237
01:32:23,640 --> 01:32:26,080
I've done it.
But this is not even just a dad thing.

2238
01:32:26,081 --> 01:32:28,740
It's just a,
a position of power like this.

2239
01:32:28,741 --> 01:32:31,570
Someone is like,
they've accomplished something.

2240
01:32:31,571 --> 01:32:34,030
Maybe that's looking to be the new
Darwinism is this is like,

2241
01:32:34,031 --> 01:32:36,340
I don't need to date a man who has
power.

2242
01:32:36,341 --> 01:32:37,560
I don't really need protection.
Right.

2243
01:32:37,561 --> 01:32:40,000
Cause we have alarm systems and I have a
lock on my door and whatever,

2244
01:32:40,001 --> 01:32:43,210
but we're still wired to seek men that
are Alphas and then have power and that

2245
01:32:43,211 --> 01:32:45,430
have resources even though,
you know,

2246
01:32:46,120 --> 01:32:47,850
we're not,
I don't think that's going to go anytime

2247
01:32:47,860 --> 01:32:49,630
soon unless we go full socialist.

2248
01:32:49,720 --> 01:32:52,670
Like we're not as vulnerable as we were
2000 years ago.

2249
01:32:52,671 --> 01:32:53,650
And you know,
yeah.

2250
01:32:53,680 --> 01:32:56,440
Well we're definitely,
I'm sure 2000 years ago,

2251
01:32:56,441 --> 01:33:00,160
men and women and had a much more
different dynamic than they have in 2018

2252
01:33:00,210 --> 01:33:01,600
yeah,
it's getting better.

2253
01:33:01,900 --> 01:33:05,680
I think overall we have less violence.
We have less crime.

2254
01:33:05,681 --> 01:33:08,530
We have less,
almost everything today than we did 2000

2255
01:33:08,531 --> 01:33:10,360
years ago.
And I think in,

2256
01:33:10,420 --> 01:33:13,000
but I think the amount of radical change
it's happening,

2257
01:33:13,001 --> 01:33:15,730
like we were talking about before,
between 1960 and today,

2258
01:33:16,740 --> 01:33:20,440
if we go another 50 years in the future,
it's gonna be even more insane.

2259
01:33:20,441 --> 01:33:23,830
But it just might be like,
like the got the people that thrive are

2260
01:33:23,831 --> 01:33:27,530
the ones that are able to have some self
control over their primordial brain.

2261
01:33:27,531 --> 01:33:29,620
So it's like you,
it's like I want a Ferrari.

2262
01:33:29,710 --> 01:33:31,730
Like I would love to,
but it just doesn't make sense.

2263
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:33,850
You don't want to suck that Donald
Sterling Guy's Dick.

2264
01:33:33,900 --> 01:33:35,410
Do you know what I mean?
Totally.

2265
01:33:35,411 --> 01:33:36,141
It,
it seem worth it.

2266
01:33:36,141 --> 01:33:38,530
I love to eat pizza every night,
but I'll fucking die.

2267
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:40,030
That's not hell.
I'll get fat.

2268
01:33:40,031 --> 01:33:40,471
You know,
you'll,

2269
01:33:40,471 --> 01:33:43,450
we'll just start to understand the
consequences of dating the person that

2270
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:47,260
we are sort of primally attracted to and
just go like,

2271
01:33:47,261 --> 01:33:48,460
I know what that is.
That's what I want,

2272
01:33:48,461 --> 01:33:51,190
but I can't have everything I want
because I'm a fucking human adult.

2273
01:33:51,370 --> 01:33:56,370
I think there's also a real,
the way human beings react and the way

2274
01:33:56,411 --> 01:34:00,250
we even think and the way what we think
is acceptable and isn't acceptable,

2275
01:34:00,251 --> 01:34:02,950
changes with the culture.
And I think like,

2276
01:34:03,100 --> 01:34:07,570
it's one of the problems with going back
to like 1960 and being upset at some of

2277
01:34:07,571 --> 01:34:10,060
the way people behaved because it's
like,

2278
01:34:10,070 --> 01:34:12,010
man,
that is the way people behaved back

2279
01:34:12,011 --> 01:34:12,270
then.

2280
01:34:12,270 --> 01:34:13,810
We,
we know better now,

2281
01:34:14,020 --> 01:34:18,010
but to get mad and a man who uh,
behaved a certain way,

2282
01:34:18,011 --> 01:34:19,450
nothing.
I'm not talking about like drugging and

2283
01:34:19,451 --> 01:34:21,580
raping and stuff like that,
but certain,

2284
01:34:21,610 --> 01:34:24,370
uh,
20 years ago when it classic acceptable

2285
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:28,090
sexist behavior from 1960,
that was just normal.

2286
01:34:28,120 --> 01:34:30,910
Yeah.
Like I think this is just a part of the

2287
01:34:30,911 --> 01:34:33,070
culture and people thought that's how
you behaved.

2288
01:34:33,250 --> 01:34:35,860
Now people are shifting and I think
we're,

2289
01:34:36,310 --> 01:34:38,440
and also I think one of the things
that's going on in this is one of the

2290
01:34:38,441 --> 01:34:40,780
things that's empowered the women's
movement in the powered a lot of other

2291
01:34:40,781 --> 01:34:44,080
movements is access to information.
It's radical.

2292
01:34:44,081 --> 01:34:47,650
It's happening so fast and it's,
it's inundating us and we have to catch

2293
01:34:47,651 --> 01:34:49,710
up to it.
It's like it's happening so goddamn

2294
01:34:49,750 --> 01:34:51,410
quickly that we,
we're just trying,

2295
01:34:51,430 --> 01:34:52,310
okay,
what does,

2296
01:34:52,330 --> 01:34:54,250
okay now?
What's not okay now what can we do?

2297
01:34:54,251 --> 01:34:56,350
What can we not do?
And access to each other.

2298
01:34:56,410 --> 01:34:58,160
Like never before have 10

2299
01:34:58,160 --> 01:35:01,880
women all assaulted by the same man,
been able to meet each other.

2300
01:35:02,130 --> 01:35:03,920
Well,
how else would we run into the grocery

2301
01:35:03,921 --> 01:35:04,251
store?
Hey,

2302
01:35:04,251 --> 01:35:06,050
were you assaulted by that guy by any
chance?

2303
01:35:06,170 --> 01:35:07,620
Like we were able to find each other
online.

2304
01:35:07,630 --> 01:35:09,470
Jamie,
where are you talking about Steve Corral

2305
01:35:09,471 --> 01:35:11,480
and the office?
Was it you that was talking about that?

2306
01:35:11,930 --> 01:35:15,260
What about you watched the old episodes
of the office,

2307
01:35:15,261 --> 01:35:18,530
which is not that long ago.
He was such a creep.

2308
01:35:20,210 --> 01:35:25,040
You can't really do that.
But he was kind of like bumbling,

2309
01:35:25,480 --> 01:35:28,370
you know,
like what was the difference?

2310
01:35:29,010 --> 01:35:32,330
I think the percepta sewed where a girl
shows up to sell purses and he's just

2311
01:35:32,331 --> 01:35:34,190
like,
makes a big to do.

2312
01:35:34,191 --> 01:35:36,440
Just like you can have the conference
room and guess what?

2313
01:35:36,441 --> 01:35:39,710
I just got this espresso maker.
Don't make me give it to you cause I

2314
01:35:39,711 --> 01:35:40,521
won't.
Oh,

2315
01:35:40,521 --> 01:35:42,710
do you need a ride home?
I'll give you a ride home.

2316
01:35:42,740 --> 01:35:46,250
But didn't feel creepy or did the ride
home thing was a very particular creepy

2317
01:35:46,251 --> 01:35:48,040
thing based today's world.
Right.

2318
01:35:48,100 --> 01:35:51,050
And I think what I know about the
English version,

2319
01:35:51,051 --> 01:35:52,730
I don't know what the intention was for
the American version.

2320
01:35:52,731 --> 01:35:56,360
The idea was to make him kind of
polarizing and it makes you

2321
01:35:56,361 --> 01:35:57,440
uncomfortable.
And He,

2322
01:35:58,430 --> 01:35:59,930
it's crazy that it wasn't that long ago.

2323
01:36:07,130 --> 01:36:08,630
Tangible.
It's hard to explain.

2324
01:36:08,631 --> 01:36:11,510
And I think this is why a lot of guys
were getting annoyed because when you

2325
01:36:11,511 --> 01:36:14,390
get granular about it,
it makes us seem like we're just being

2326
01:36:14,391 --> 01:36:17,810
crazy.
You Hug me at the comedy store and it

2327
01:36:17,811 --> 01:36:20,660
feels different than when,
let's call him Joe.

2328
01:36:20,661 --> 01:36:23,030
Blow hugs me.
There's just something creepy about Joe

2329
01:36:23,031 --> 01:36:26,180
blow and there's something not creepy
about you and I can't explain it and I

2330
01:36:26,181 --> 01:36:30,110
can't tell you why.
And I sound crazy and manic and history

2331
01:36:30,410 --> 01:36:32,330
doesn't sound because that's the same
way with gay guys.

2332
01:36:32,530 --> 01:36:34,550
There's certain gay guys and hugged me
where it's creepy.

2333
01:36:35,090 --> 01:36:39,680
There's certain gay guys that hug me,
hug me.

2334
01:36:39,681 --> 01:36:40,514
I'm like,
what's up?

2335
01:36:40,570 --> 01:36:42,770
Get my hug.
And it's all just warm and friendly and

2336
01:36:42,771 --> 01:36:44,130
it's cool.
It doesn't matter if the game,

2337
01:36:44,480 --> 01:36:47,840
but then there's other guys that they
hang onto me a little or they'll squeeze

2338
01:36:47,841 --> 01:36:50,270
my back a little and it just gets a
little,

2339
01:36:50,271 --> 01:36:51,230
little extra.

2340
01:36:55,220 --> 01:36:58,700
Females are kind of trying to,
the more granular stuff.

2341
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:02,990
I know it sounds like I'm being crazy,
but I promise

2342
01:37:06,070 --> 01:37:06,903
proof.
And I don't know,

2343
01:37:08,090 --> 01:37:13,090
but the crazier I sound,
but it's just making me thirsty.

2344
01:37:14,210 --> 01:37:16,250
It's like a hug that lasts a little too
long.

2345
01:37:16,460 --> 01:37:21,460
I had a guy office
from a bad date.

2346
01:37:23,841 --> 01:37:27,390
It seems like you both eight eight each
other out and went down on each other.

2347
01:37:27,980 --> 01:37:30,710
It sounds like it sucked,
but then you're anonymous and then

2348
01:37:30,711 --> 01:37:33,440
you're,
you're 22 or 23 like this is like poor

2349
01:37:33,441 --> 01:37:36,850
judgment does a lot of cruelty involved
too.

2350
01:37:36,860 --> 01:37:40,310
Like somebody described it as revenge
porn for women.

2351
01:37:40,311 --> 01:37:42,530
Yeah.
Look,

2352
01:37:43,100 --> 01:37:47,910
this is not,
these are not comparable crimes and I,

2353
01:37:49,340 --> 01:37:52,030
I can't speak to saying who's guilty and
all that sort of,

2354
01:37:52,410 --> 01:37:56,010
I don't know what happened information,
but I

2355
01:37:56,010 --> 01:37:59,640
don't think that that this person is
coming forward equating it to rape.

2356
01:37:59,670 --> 01:38:01,890
I think women know that there's
different echelons.

2357
01:38:01,891 --> 01:38:03,690
There's rape,
sexual assault,

2358
01:38:03,691 --> 01:38:04,740
assault.
I mean,

2359
01:38:04,741 --> 01:38:06,690
look,
I don't know enough about it and none of

2360
01:38:06,691 --> 01:38:10,710
us were there.
But like I do know in my twenties I'm

2361
01:38:10,711 --> 01:38:11,880
not saying as he's as guilty,
again,

2362
01:38:11,881 --> 01:38:14,250
I don't know.
But in my twenties I had a lot of sex

2363
01:38:14,251 --> 01:38:17,640
that I felt I was coerced into that was
transactional sex that I didn't want to

2364
01:38:17,641 --> 01:38:19,080
have.
You know,

2365
01:38:19,110 --> 01:38:21,210
and this is something we talk about in
the female brain movie,

2366
01:38:21,211 --> 01:38:24,650
is that men are less able to read cues
or emotional cues on,

2367
01:38:24,810 --> 01:38:28,880
on faces than women are
so apparent.

2368
01:38:29,160 --> 01:38:33,120
So we have evolved to cry four times
more easily because men have a harder

2369
01:38:33,121 --> 01:38:34,890
time reading,
um,

2370
01:38:35,040 --> 01:38:39,330
emotional cues on faces.
That's why women crying until we crazier

2371
01:38:39,331 --> 01:38:42,720
because men are designed to sort of like
see movement and to hunt and to,

2372
01:38:42,750 --> 01:38:43,020
right.

2373
01:38:43,020 --> 01:38:44,610
You're not designed to sort of read
like,

2374
01:38:44,640 --> 01:38:46,380
oh,
is she frustrated or angry?

2375
01:38:46,410 --> 01:38:46,951
You know,
like,

2376
01:38:46,951 --> 01:38:48,690
have you ever been on a double date with
your wife?

2377
01:38:48,900 --> 01:38:50,060
And like,
um,

2378
01:38:50,160 --> 01:38:53,250
you think that hit her and the other,
I can't imagine you on a double date.

2379
01:38:53,251 --> 01:38:56,850
That was so weird thinking about it.
I've done those things really in the

2380
01:38:56,851 --> 01:39:00,230
very early stage.
But have you ever like,

2381
01:39:00,720 --> 01:39:02,460
yeah.
And you go on a double date and like you

2382
01:39:02,461 --> 01:39:05,070
have to fucking talk to the guy and he's
asking you a million questions about

2383
01:39:05,071 --> 01:39:07,020
hunting and you're like,
just listen to my podcast.

2384
01:39:07,021 --> 01:39:08,400
Why do I have to fucking do this for
free?

2385
01:39:08,580 --> 01:39:12,870
And then your wife is talking to the
other girl and you think it's going well

2386
01:39:12,871 --> 01:39:14,460
and the girl gets the car and you're
like,

2387
01:39:14,461 --> 01:39:15,450
oh my well,
and you're like,

2388
01:39:15,451 --> 01:39:16,950
she was such a bitch,
I couldn't fucking stand her.

2389
01:39:16,950 --> 01:39:19,350
And you're like,
it seems like you guys got along great,

2390
01:39:19,620 --> 01:39:20,221
you know,
like,

2391
01:39:20,221 --> 01:39:22,330
has that ever happened to you?
Okay.

2392
01:39:23,160 --> 01:39:28,160
She's just had it.
She just talks like if she,

2393
01:39:28,230 --> 01:39:30,930
if she thought something was bad,
she would let everybody know like right

2394
01:39:30,931 --> 01:39:33,870
away while she would just,
it'd be obvious or just,

2395
01:39:33,871 --> 01:39:35,460
just sort of like,
sometimes there's like,

2396
01:39:35,780 --> 01:39:37,110
um,
basically,

2397
01:39:37,111 --> 01:39:38,400
and we talk about the movie,
it's like,

2398
01:39:38,460 --> 01:39:41,820
it's just men are not as good at reading
emotions on faces.

2399
01:39:41,821 --> 01:39:42,840
So it's like,
if you were to say like,

2400
01:39:42,841 --> 01:39:43,770
Whitney,
how are you?

2401
01:39:43,950 --> 01:39:44,783
And I was like,
I'm fine.

2402
01:39:45,390 --> 01:39:46,350
You might just be like,
okay,

2403
01:39:46,351 --> 01:39:47,610
she's fine.
Let's move on.

2404
01:39:47,670 --> 01:39:51,240
A lot of guys can't understand that
there's a discrepancy between what I'm

2405
01:39:51,241 --> 01:39:53,610
saying and how I'm saying it.
And it's like about just reading,

2406
01:39:53,611 --> 01:39:56,670
like how muscles move on on human faces.
So it's like you can look up,

2407
01:39:56,940 --> 01:39:59,070
um,
sort of the difference and you know,

2408
01:39:59,071 --> 01:40:01,440
so I'm not defending men in that area.

2409
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:04,530
I think that that an interesting
conversation that might come up at some

2410
01:40:04,531 --> 01:40:07,170
point as people who have autism are
really going to be fucked in all of

2411
01:40:07,171 --> 01:40:09,840
this.
People who can't pick up on social cues

2412
01:40:09,870 --> 01:40:13,020
because so much of this is nonverbal.
I fear that we're going to get to a

2413
01:40:13,021 --> 01:40:15,900
place where we're going to have to like
sign contracts and ship before we have

2414
01:40:15,901 --> 01:40:17,390
sex and stuff.
Because I,

2415
01:40:17,590 --> 01:40:18,423
you know,
I,

2416
01:40:18,750 --> 01:40:21,870
I know that in my twenties and I'm
freezing up just talking about it,

2417
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:25,050
is that when men made physical man says
to me,

2418
01:40:25,080 --> 01:40:27,570
I would be giving off these nonverbal
cues.

2419
01:40:27,870 --> 01:40:29,850
Um,
and I wasn't saying no,

2420
01:40:29,851 --> 01:40:32,460
but my body was saying no.
And I'm not saying it's necessarily a

2421
01:40:32,461 --> 01:40:34,920
guy is supposed to like be able to read
my body language,

2422
01:40:34,921 --> 01:40:37,740
but that's what was happening cause I
froze up because of my trauma response

2423
01:40:37,950 --> 01:40:38,880
and I was scared.

2424
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:41,640
And also we are conditioned to be
submissive to men.

2425
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:44,040
Um,
I am conditioned to feel shame if I

2426
01:40:44,041 --> 01:40:45,960
don't fuck a guy in a certain amount of
time,

2427
01:40:46,500 --> 01:40:50,880
I spent totally the opposite.
I thought you would feel shame if you

2428
01:40:50,881 --> 01:40:54,040
fucked a guy too quick about a guy on
the first day and you feel shame.

2429
01:40:54,190 --> 01:40:56,320
But if you,
there's this sort of like unspoken rule

2430
01:40:56,321 --> 01:40:58,390
that you like kind of have to fuck a guy
on the third day.

2431
01:40:58,470 --> 01:40:59,350
Wow.
Yeah.

2432
01:40:59,410 --> 01:41:02,830
Oh totally am.
I do not think that Jamie's never heard

2433
01:41:02,831 --> 01:41:03,350
of.
So yeah,

2434
01:41:03,350 --> 01:41:07,170
I feel like guilt and shame and I'm
difficult and I'm a prude and I'm like,

2435
01:41:07,180 --> 01:41:08,680
would I ever,
yeah,

2436
01:41:08,681 --> 01:41:10,780
this might just be me,
but like every,

2437
01:41:10,781 --> 01:41:13,360
I mean every girl that I know that I'm,
maybe it's just my generation or

2438
01:41:13,361 --> 01:41:15,340
something and guy out there like,
oh,

2439
01:41:15,341 --> 01:41:17,470
I gotta do is just get three dates in
and we're in.

2440
01:41:17,500 --> 01:41:19,630
But think about all,
think about negotiate.

2441
01:41:19,631 --> 01:41:22,750
So just the,
just the tip is like something we joke

2442
01:41:22,751 --> 01:41:23,584
about,
right?

2443
01:41:23,620 --> 01:41:26,440
But it is based in the idea of
negotiating for sex.

2444
01:41:26,500 --> 01:41:28,450
So if someone is starting to say,
just the tip,

2445
01:41:28,451 --> 01:41:29,950
that means I've already said no,
and you're like,

2446
01:41:29,951 --> 01:41:31,330
well come on.
How about just a blowjob?

2447
01:41:31,450 --> 01:41:32,231
And then I'm like,
no,

2448
01:41:32,231 --> 01:41:33,400
just come on.
Just the tip.

2449
01:41:33,401 --> 01:41:36,040
It's like we joke about it but that
means it in negotiation is going on.

2450
01:41:36,041 --> 01:41:39,790
And then I've already said no,
and then you just get worn down.

2451
01:41:40,150 --> 01:41:43,090
And that's like transactional sex,
which I think women are kind of just,

2452
01:41:43,360 --> 01:41:45,290
I won't generalize about all women.
Um,

2453
01:41:45,310 --> 01:41:46,810
but I think some women are like sort of
like,

2454
01:41:46,840 --> 01:41:49,150
I don't want to have that kind of
transactional sex anymore.

2455
01:41:49,270 --> 01:41:51,550
And like,
like I feel like I'm being used as a

2456
01:41:51,551 --> 01:41:52,384
blow up doll.

2457
01:41:52,510 --> 01:41:55,600
And I think from what I understand,
that girl fell as,

2458
01:41:55,601 --> 01:41:58,870
she felt like she was like rush through
dinner and like went back and was just

2459
01:41:58,871 --> 01:42:03,871
sort of expected to be fucked.
And I think a lot of what's happening is

2460
01:42:04,241 --> 01:42:07,750
that men were promised something from
porn and women were promised something

2461
01:42:07,751 --> 01:42:10,450
from romantic comedies.
Men were promised that women like won it

2462
01:42:10,451 --> 01:42:14,200
all the time and women had been promised
that men like want to talk to us.

2463
01:42:14,530 --> 01:42:16,630
And I think these expectations are
clashing.

2464
01:42:16,631 --> 01:42:18,910
So I think it's a little bit of nature
and a little bit of nurture.

2465
01:42:18,990 --> 01:42:23,880
So a lot of it being media
misrepresentations of actual

2466
01:42:23,881 --> 01:42:26,760
relationships and that's the models that
people are acting on

2467
01:42:26,810 --> 01:42:27,850
maybe.
Yeah,

2468
01:42:28,010 --> 01:42:30,500
I think it's different for every person
because every person has a different

2469
01:42:30,501 --> 01:42:32,930
experience with sex.
Everyone has a different ability to read

2470
01:42:32,931 --> 01:42:34,520
faces,
everyone has a different nature and

2471
01:42:34,521 --> 01:42:37,160
nurture.
Everyone had different fucking parenting

2472
01:42:37,670 --> 01:42:40,970
problem with like sometimes you really
shouldn't be with that person and you're

2473
01:42:40,971 --> 01:42:43,260
there and you're there and what do you
do?

2474
01:42:43,540 --> 01:42:45,050
What do you do?
I mean I do,

2475
01:42:45,140 --> 01:42:47,720
I literally had sex before just to like
get out of there.

2476
01:42:49,880 --> 01:42:50,631
You're just like,
Oh God,

2477
01:42:50,631 --> 01:42:52,370
I don't want to argue with this person
right now.

2478
01:42:52,371 --> 01:42:56,060
But I feel like this first one feels
entitled to my body and I feel shame and

2479
01:42:56,061 --> 01:42:59,090
I'm embarrassed and like it's just all
this stuff that's really kind of hard to

2480
01:42:59,091 --> 01:43:03,140
explain and I think it probably is
annoying to the guy and I just like,

2481
01:43:03,141 --> 01:43:05,870
I don't want to be difficult and I've
been so gas lit to believe that I'm

2482
01:43:05,871 --> 01:43:08,030
difficult.
It just gets like really messy and then

2483
01:43:08,031 --> 01:43:10,470
by the time you figure it out you've
already had sex and you're just like,

2484
01:43:10,480 --> 01:43:10,700
okay

2485
01:43:10,700 --> 01:43:12,170
fuck,
can I have my parking pass back?

2486
01:43:12,550 --> 01:43:15,110
This isn't,
this is part of just being a human and

2487
01:43:15,111 --> 01:43:19,850
trying to navigate your way through the
fucking treacherous waters of just

2488
01:43:19,851 --> 01:43:22,280
social interactions,
sexual interactions.

2489
01:43:22,370 --> 01:43:24,200
I didn't figure it out until I was 32
years old.

2490
01:43:24,201 --> 01:43:27,290
I wasn't able to like articulate or
figure out whether I actually want to be

2491
01:43:27,291 --> 01:43:29,510
having sex or not.
So like my advice to all my guy friends

2492
01:43:29,511 --> 01:43:33,140
is do not have sex with girls and under
30 cause like I could not,

2493
01:43:33,230 --> 01:43:37,070
I didn't have the ability to even know
or say what I wanted until I was

2494
01:43:37,310 --> 01:43:39,890
for men.
A lot of men feel like if you have sex

2495
01:43:39,891 --> 01:43:43,910
with a girl who's under 30 then it's fun
and you can have fun.

2496
01:43:43,940 --> 01:43:47,420
But if you have sex with a girl who's
over 30 their biological clock is

2497
01:43:47,421 --> 01:43:52,421
ticking and the present time,
I should sound nice pressuring you into

2498
01:43:53,481 --> 01:43:54,291
this,
you know,

2499
01:43:54,291 --> 01:43:56,690
relationship very quickly.
What's your intentions?

2500
01:43:56,691 --> 01:43:58,400
Where's this going?
I want to know what we,

2501
01:43:58,580 --> 01:44:00,180
how we stand,
what are we yet

2502
01:44:00,760 --> 01:44:02,580
block or find another one.
There's tinder.

2503
01:44:02,581 --> 01:44:05,580
You can find plenty of women in their
thirties what have you like are you just

2504
01:44:05,581 --> 01:44:07,500
want to calm down and you swear like a
one.

2505
01:44:07,560 --> 01:44:09,780
Let's work this out.
I mean look,

2506
01:44:10,400 --> 01:44:12,600
we're going to have to like start
talking to each other I guess and like

2507
01:44:12,601 --> 01:44:14,820
setting expectations.
I know that sounds like a nightmare.

2508
01:44:14,821 --> 01:44:16,410
It doesn't,
it so much drama.

2509
01:44:16,440 --> 01:44:18,000
Oh BC.
But it's also,

2510
01:44:18,001 --> 01:44:21,440
it's like so funny.
This is totally like I,

2511
01:44:21,450 --> 01:44:24,840
I'm probably shouldn't say this,
but I was thinking someone was like,

2512
01:44:24,841 --> 01:44:27,090
yeah.
And then they had dinner and afterwards

2513
01:44:27,360 --> 01:44:29,760
they s whatever and she wasn't into it.
I was like,

2514
01:44:29,940 --> 01:44:32,910
that is already fishing.
I never want to have sex after dinner.

2515
01:44:32,940 --> 01:44:36,690
I think it's disgusting.
I'm like full of Lasagna.

2516
01:44:36,710 --> 01:44:40,530
Like I don't want anything in my body
after I've eaten.

2517
01:44:40,531 --> 01:44:43,140
Like I need a couple,
I like to have sex before I eat.

2518
01:44:43,140 --> 01:44:44,640
So He's going down.
You have to Fart.

2519
01:44:46,470 --> 01:44:47,850
Can we,
if we're going to,

2520
01:44:47,851 --> 01:44:52,851
if I'm just assume that not any sex
after dinner it's not consensual.

2521
01:44:53,670 --> 01:44:55,170
Super Normal.
Yeah.

2522
01:44:55,190 --> 01:44:57,260
I grossed out by,
Oh look,

2523
01:44:57,280 --> 01:45:00,240
if I just like eat chicken farmers,
like I don't want your,

2524
01:45:00,420 --> 01:45:02,270
you know,
stick together.

2525
01:45:02,730 --> 01:45:03,590
You know,
so I,

2526
01:45:03,591 --> 01:45:06,810
I just know that I've had a lot of sex
in my twenties that I didn't want to be

2527
01:45:06,811 --> 01:45:10,650
having that felt transactional,
that just didn't feel,

2528
01:45:10,680 --> 01:45:11,430
you know,
I think that,

2529
01:45:11,430 --> 01:45:12,630
you know,
who really wins and all those

2530
01:45:12,900 --> 01:45:16,130
prostitutes and sex robots.
I think

2531
01:45:16,310 --> 01:45:18,950
prostitution was legal.
See the problem we even would,

2532
01:45:18,951 --> 01:45:21,260
prostitution being legals is still
shameful.

2533
01:45:21,530 --> 01:45:25,070
It's still looked down upon.
Whereas massage keep your job,

2534
01:45:26,180 --> 01:45:26,820
you get to keep,

2535
01:45:26,820 --> 01:45:29,130
what did you get to keep your job?
I just say no.

2536
01:45:29,131 --> 01:45:33,660
I mean like if you're afraid of sexually
assaulting someone by accident or having

2537
01:45:33,661 --> 01:45:37,440
an inter personal relationship at work
and all this stuff that's going on,

2538
01:45:37,441 --> 01:45:40,050
just like having sex with a hooker,
like you're not gonna get fired,

2539
01:45:40,110 --> 01:45:40,740
they're not going to work

2540
01:45:40,740 --> 01:45:42,270
port you.
Yes.

2541
01:45:42,420 --> 01:45:47,400
But it's very problematic in that it
establishes this dynamic between a man

2542
01:45:47,401 --> 01:45:49,230
and a woman where it's very
transactional.

2543
01:45:49,260 --> 01:45:50,280
Yeah.
And uh,

2544
01:45:50,340 --> 01:45:53,130
yeah.
And then if you get accustom to

2545
01:45:53,131 --> 01:45:55,650
transactional sex,
it could make it worse when you're

2546
01:45:55,651 --> 01:45:58,440
actually what it's like then your
thought is just I just got to pay for

2547
01:45:58,441 --> 01:45:58,960
it.
Why?

2548
01:45:58,960 --> 01:46:02,250
Why would I deal with your bullshit?
I'll just be a grownup baby.

2549
01:46:02,430 --> 01:46:03,710
I decided to get my dick sucked all

2550
01:46:03,860 --> 01:46:06,470
I just mean if like men need,
cause I literally was thinking about the

2551
01:46:06,471 --> 01:46:07,700
other day,
I was like I would like someone to

2552
01:46:07,701 --> 01:46:12,440
invent like a virtual reality game so
that women can understand what sex feels

2553
01:46:12,441 --> 01:46:15,200
like from like,
it must be so amazing.

2554
01:46:15,230 --> 01:46:16,250
I was thinking about it

2555
01:46:16,810 --> 01:46:18,740
more amazing for guy than is for a woman
gets,

2556
01:46:18,741 --> 01:46:23,350
I'm like to be willing to like throw
away your career and take that big of a

2557
01:46:23,351 --> 01:46:24,730
risk.
That's not what it is.

2558
01:46:25,030 --> 01:46:28,840
No it's this what the way I described it
in one of my specials,

2559
01:46:28,841 --> 01:46:33,841
I said being a man is like having a
small 24 hours sperm factory with a very

2560
01:46:36,401 --> 01:46:40,570
shitty agreement with the union.
You got one delivery truck that's your

2561
01:46:40,571 --> 01:46:41,404
Dick.
Yup.

2562
01:46:41,500 --> 01:46:45,340
And you've got one warehouse and
packages are piling up every day

2563
01:46:45,470 --> 01:46:49,150
and you dig.
It's like these fucking packages

2564
01:46:51,030 --> 01:46:53,520
and the more it stacks up,
the more desperate you get,

2565
01:46:53,521 --> 01:46:56,310
the more you're willing to negotiate.
And then we do stupid things.

2566
01:46:56,340 --> 01:47:00,840
The nature of being a human being is men
are trying to get rid of calm cause

2567
01:47:00,841 --> 01:47:04,170
we're making it all day long.
All Day long we're making Kom were come

2568
01:47:04,171 --> 01:47:05,850
factories.
That's what we are.

2569
01:47:05,851 --> 01:47:06,810
And,
and when,

2570
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:08,800
when a man doesn't have sex for a few
days,

2571
01:47:08,850 --> 01:47:12,420
you don't like I went through a,
I did an experiment on my website like a

2572
01:47:12,840 --> 01:47:15,180
few,
many years back where I didn't jerk off

2573
01:47:15,181 --> 01:47:16,210
for a month.
What happened?

2574
01:47:16,380 --> 01:47:17,520
It was like,
Holy Shit,

2575
01:47:17,790 --> 01:47:20,610
you get so desperate.
Like just touching people.

2576
01:47:20,611 --> 01:47:22,110
Just getting a hug.
Your Dick gets hard.

2577
01:47:22,260 --> 01:47:23,610
He's like,
this is bizarre.

2578
01:47:23,640 --> 01:47:26,250
Like,
cause most of the time guys handle it by

2579
01:47:26,251 --> 01:47:29,340
just jerking off you just like,
it's like a relief.

2580
01:47:29,370 --> 01:47:30,000
You just,
you're,

2581
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:33,060
you literally a backed up.
I have pressure and you relieve it.

2582
01:47:33,090 --> 01:47:34,380
I don't know what it's like to be a
woman,

2583
01:47:34,381 --> 01:47:38,640
but one thing I do know is you're not
making a thing that you have to get rid

2584
01:47:38,641 --> 01:47:41,220
of you.
Like we have the end.

2585
01:47:41,221 --> 01:47:46,020
The difference between a guy being horny
on like day one of no jerking off versus

2586
01:47:46,021 --> 01:47:48,660
day 30 you're a totally different human
being.

2587
01:47:49,080 --> 01:47:50,850
You're a desperate,
you know,

2588
01:47:50,851 --> 01:47:54,060
and men who have had,
don't ever get touched and don't ever

2589
01:47:54,061 --> 01:47:57,600
get to have sex are extremely desperate.
And then we'll do almost anything that

2590
01:47:57,601 --> 01:48:01,260
we'll negotiate in very bizarre ways in
order to be involved in relationships.

2591
01:48:01,261 --> 01:48:05,580
That's why you see men that are quote,
pussy whipped,

2592
01:48:05,610 --> 01:48:07,650
like why are they pussy whipped and what
is that?

2593
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:11,880
Well that's the only option they have.
These are weak people and the only

2594
01:48:11,881 --> 01:48:15,360
option they have is to acquiesce to
whatever desires and needs the woman

2595
01:48:15,361 --> 01:48:16,020
has.

2596
01:48:16,020 --> 01:48:18,180
You have to submit,
you have to submit,

2597
01:48:18,181 --> 01:48:20,640
and then she'll throw some pussy at you
like a dog.

2598
01:48:20,670 --> 01:48:24,240
It's some fucking scratch your way.
That's literally what happened.

2599
01:48:24,510 --> 01:48:27,590
And just thought of airborne posts.
Teddy has

2600
01:48:29,650 --> 01:48:34,650
all
these men had no lack of putsy in their

2601
01:48:35,431 --> 01:48:36,560
lives.
These which men?

2602
01:48:36,990 --> 01:48:40,510
Powerful men that are going down,
but this is whenever they want it.

2603
01:48:40,540 --> 01:48:41,610
Right.
But there's still,

2604
01:48:41,611 --> 01:48:44,710
there's well Harvey Weinstein thing I
read,

2605
01:48:45,180 --> 01:48:47,530
it
wasn't fucking,

2606
01:48:47,560 --> 01:48:51,990
I don't think he was a fucking addict
and I think he's a power addict,

2607
01:48:52,200 --> 01:48:55,140
sex addict and he's a fat fuck.
So he's a food addict.

2608
01:48:55,620 --> 01:49:00,620
Everything addict and power,
they baby it just stuffing things in his

2609
01:49:03,241 --> 01:49:04,770
body.
I mean he's a fucking

2610
01:49:06,720 --> 01:49:08,850
thing though.
Power and fame addict.

2611
01:49:08,880 --> 01:49:10,380
Then I'll tell you a story about bill
cosby.

2612
01:49:10,620 --> 01:49:13,410
I used to a,
I did this casino once and I talked to

2613
01:49:13,411 --> 01:49:15,660
this woman who was the one of the
managers that casino.

2614
01:49:15,940 --> 01:49:20,250
She said bill cosby would make the
entire staff watch him eat curry before

2615
01:49:20,251 --> 01:49:22,500
he would perform.
They would have to watch him eat.

2616
01:49:22,680 --> 01:49:24,660
It would come into his dressing room and
he wouldn't talk to them.

2617
01:49:24,780 --> 01:49:28,410
He would watch him eat and that's what
he would do when he wanted,

2618
01:49:28,740 --> 01:49:31,530
when he was eating his food before us
performance,

2619
01:49:31,860 --> 01:49:34,620
everyone had to watch him.
Then he had someone,

2620
01:49:34,770 --> 01:49:37,770
a security guard,
tuck him into bed at night.

2621
01:49:37,771 --> 01:49:40,590
They had a tuck him in,
so he laid in bed and they would talk

2622
01:49:40,591 --> 01:49:44,190
him in and then shut the lights off and
closed the door like he mental

2623
01:49:44,191 --> 01:49:46,800
illnesses.
That delusions of grand jury,

2624
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:48,220
a separation

2625
01:49:48,220 --> 01:49:52,240
from normal society.
This thought that he is royalty,

2626
01:49:52,420 --> 01:49:53,560
right?
This is what I think.

2627
01:49:53,561 --> 01:49:56,050
I think the same behavior that kings
have.

2628
01:49:56,260 --> 01:49:59,680
You see that with dictators.
You see that with celebrities that are,

2629
01:49:59,950 --> 01:50:04,600
especially celebrities that again became
super famous 50 60 years ago,

2630
01:50:04,850 --> 01:50:06,430
like bill cosby.
You know,

2631
01:50:06,431 --> 01:50:09,700
he was famous 60 years ago.
Some people like Danny Masterson who is

2632
01:50:09,701 --> 01:50:11,530
young,
this guy's not,

2633
01:50:11,590 --> 01:50:13,960
you know,
the Danny masterson one is interesting

2634
01:50:13,961 --> 01:50:18,020
because he's a scientology
scientology.

2635
01:50:19,050 --> 01:50:20,890
I mean,
now I think he's left.

2636
01:50:20,920 --> 01:50:24,640
I don't know if they could embrace,
well this is Paul Haggis too.

2637
01:50:24,641 --> 01:50:28,240
This is one of the things that um,
they were saying about him because they

2638
01:50:28,241 --> 01:50:31,390
think that he's being set up.
I understand by right.

2639
01:50:31,391 --> 01:50:31,931
So,
yeah,

2640
01:50:31,931 --> 01:50:33,500
I know Leah Remini I heard her saying
that.

2641
01:50:33,540 --> 01:50:35,830
She was saying these are fake.
I don't know if that's true.

2642
01:50:36,040 --> 01:50:38,650
Danny masterson didn't leave like,
I don't think it was employee.

2643
01:50:38,650 --> 01:50:43,060
I've been hearing this for years.
The fuck didn't you cool?

2644
01:50:44,310 --> 01:50:46,990
Hey,
tell everybody this is my phone as a

2645
01:50:46,991 --> 01:50:48,010
phone.
Still look like that.

2646
01:50:48,011 --> 01:50:48,970
No,
if this is true,

2647
01:50:48,971 --> 01:50:50,730
but I'm going to tell you because I
don't want to,

2648
01:50:50,740 --> 01:50:53,410
you feel bad about it.
10 years from now I know.

2649
01:50:53,411 --> 01:50:54,244
Totally.
Like,

2650
01:50:54,520 --> 01:50:56,350
you know,
like I had heard creepy shit about him,

2651
01:50:56,351 --> 01:50:57,700
but it's like why didn't the young guy
like that?

2652
01:50:57,701 --> 01:51:00,790
Who can fuck anyone whenever he wants?
I have to do something like that.

2653
01:51:00,791 --> 01:51:02,550
And it's like,
I understand if you have all this,

2654
01:51:02,610 --> 01:51:05,440
the packages and the sperm building up,
but why can't you just jerk off?

2655
01:51:05,441 --> 01:51:06,850
Why can't you just fuck someone
consensually?

2656
01:51:07,150 --> 01:51:09,460
That's a different thing though.
The rape things at different things.

2657
01:51:09,620 --> 01:51:13,110
The rape thing is dehumanizing power
things.

2658
01:51:13,390 --> 01:51:14,200
It's like you,
you,

2659
01:51:14,200 --> 01:51:16,630
you say no fuck.
You don't say no to me,

2660
01:51:17,090 --> 01:51:18,550
I'm going to fucking do this to you and
you,

2661
01:51:18,930 --> 01:51:20,680
there's a that's not sex.

2662
01:51:20,980 --> 01:51:25,180
There's something way more.
Because if you can get hard when a woman

2663
01:51:25,210 --> 01:51:28,150
is crying and wants you to stop and
saying,

2664
01:51:28,151 --> 01:51:30,970
please stop,
don't rape me.

2665
01:51:32,310 --> 01:51:34,650
You know,
I don't want you to do this to me and

2666
01:51:34,730 --> 01:51:36,340
you,
you could still do that.

2667
01:51:36,341 --> 01:51:39,670
That's like some Viking Shit.
Really some because it's like,

2668
01:51:39,671 --> 01:51:42,520
I mean there could be some sort of,
obviously not to defend it,

2669
01:51:42,521 --> 01:51:46,330
but some sort of survival instinct in
being able to procreate with a women

2670
01:51:46,331 --> 01:51:48,940
who's not interested.
Like our biology has still not checked

2671
01:51:48,941 --> 01:51:52,540
for like overpopulation and the fact
that we no longer need to force

2672
01:51:52,541 --> 01:51:56,200
ourselves upon women to proliferate the
species.

2673
01:51:56,620 --> 01:52:01,480
There's gotta be some leftover ancient,
horrible rape DNA.

2674
01:52:01,780 --> 01:52:04,180
Cause there were a lot of people that
were,

2675
01:52:04,270 --> 01:52:08,410
I mean Genghis Khan,
his genes or in some ungodly.

2676
01:52:09,450 --> 01:52:10,920
Yeah,
pull this money.

2677
01:52:10,960 --> 01:52:11,800
Oh Shit.
Sorry.

2678
01:52:11,801 --> 01:52:13,030
I keep telling that neck again.

2679
01:52:14,230 --> 01:52:18,280
I can see,
I mean it's interesting like I'm just so

2680
01:52:18,281 --> 01:52:21,430
curious how things are going to evolve.
Like are the people that are going to

2681
01:52:21,640 --> 01:52:24,680
proliferate the ones that have the most
self control whereas it used to be your,

2682
01:52:24,730 --> 01:52:28,000
your masculinity or your value is
defined by how strong you are.

2683
01:52:28,001 --> 01:52:31,960
But how powerful and maybe the new power
is self control and restraint.

2684
01:52:32,170 --> 01:52:36,370
Well I think maybe people need to start
looking at each other as other human

2685
01:52:36,371 --> 01:52:39,940
beings instead of us versus them.
And I think that's part of the woman's

2686
01:52:39,941 --> 01:52:41,860
movement.
That's mission and part of the men's

2687
01:52:42,040 --> 01:52:44,440
side of it.
That's an issue I think we have to get

2688
01:52:44,441 --> 01:52:45,650
past.
Yeah,

2689
01:52:45,680 --> 01:52:46,280
I think

2690
01:52:46,280 --> 01:52:49,910
you know,
I'm Dan Harris from good morning America

2691
01:52:49,911 --> 01:52:52,730
was on the podcast the other day and we
were talking about in terms of politics,

2692
01:52:52,790 --> 01:52:56,750
he was saying toxic tribalism.
I love that term because that,

2693
01:52:56,751 --> 01:52:57,584
that,
that is,

2694
01:52:57,650 --> 01:53:00,620
that is across the board an issue in
this country,

2695
01:53:00,860 --> 01:53:02,360
right versus left.
Yeah.

2696
01:53:02,390 --> 01:53:04,700
That's an issue in this country with
basically everything.

2697
01:53:04,701 --> 01:53:07,430
Men versus women.
I think we have to just look at each

2698
01:53:07,431 --> 01:53:09,650
other as human beings and uh,
you know,

2699
01:53:09,651 --> 01:53:12,020
I'm not,
I'm not pro men.

2700
01:53:12,350 --> 01:53:15,710
I'm not pro woman either.
I'm pro human and there's a lot of

2701
01:53:15,711 --> 01:53:18,590
really shitty men out there and there's
a lot of really shitty women.

2702
01:53:18,830 --> 01:53:19,840
Correct.
And it's,

2703
01:53:19,841 --> 01:53:22,610
it's a real problem if we lump everybody
into,

2704
01:53:22,611 --> 01:53:25,190
well,
women want this and women or not women

2705
01:53:25,191 --> 01:53:27,080
are not going to do that.
Women are not going to lie about rape.

2706
01:53:27,081 --> 01:53:28,310
Women are not going to lie.
Of course,

2707
01:53:28,311 --> 01:53:30,400
they are just like,
men are going to lie about it because

2708
01:53:30,590 --> 01:53:31,620
people are liars.
Great.

2709
01:53:31,890 --> 01:53:36,710
There's a lot of people that are just
poorly formed human beings and they are

2710
01:53:36,711 --> 01:53:40,970
now a part of a righteous tribe of
people that are attacking this other

2711
01:53:40,971 --> 01:53:41,450
tribe.

2712
01:53:41,450 --> 01:53:43,640
And it's like most people,
most women didn't March.

2713
01:53:43,840 --> 01:53:44,720
You know what I mean?
Right,

2714
01:53:45,110 --> 01:53:45,650
right.
Hey,

2715
01:53:45,650 --> 01:53:46,350
thanks.
In,

2716
01:53:46,350 --> 01:53:50,620
they did
50 million women were marching.

2717
01:53:50,710 --> 01:53:53,000
Most women did not give a fuck.
I mean,

2718
01:53:53,250 --> 01:53:55,130
but the numbers are pretty staggering.
Staggering.

2719
01:53:55,131 --> 01:53:59,570
But there is something interesting I
think about what happens when a group of

2720
01:53:59,571 --> 01:54:01,160
women get together.
Um,

2721
01:54:01,340 --> 01:54:03,800
cause I think that has,
at least in my experience,

2722
01:54:03,830 --> 01:54:06,710
especially like in the workplace and I,
and I was like trying to do some

2723
01:54:06,711 --> 01:54:07,880
research on this.
Um,

2724
01:54:07,910 --> 01:54:09,800
and I don't know enough about it,
but there's this thing called,

2725
01:54:09,801 --> 01:54:13,640
I believe it's called favoritism bias
and it's how women in a workplace

2726
01:54:13,641 --> 01:54:18,200
actually compete with each other because
they're afraid that the man is going to

2727
01:54:18,201 --> 01:54:19,970
think that they're favoring their
gender.

2728
01:54:19,971 --> 01:54:23,030
So they're actually shitty.
It's like Queen Bee Syndrome or

2729
01:54:23,031 --> 01:54:26,270
something where it's actually,
I've experienced a lot of competition

2730
01:54:26,271 --> 01:54:28,730
with other women because there was so
much scarcity for jobs.

2731
01:54:28,730 --> 01:54:31,520
It's like women just getting in the
workforce like in the last 10,

2732
01:54:31,521 --> 01:54:32,870
20 years,
this is kind of new.

2733
01:54:32,871 --> 01:54:33,980
So it's sort of like,
bitch,

2734
01:54:34,010 --> 01:54:35,930
this is bucking my job.
Oh Hell No.

2735
01:54:36,170 --> 01:54:38,330
So I think for women actually be on the
same team,

2736
01:54:38,360 --> 01:54:42,410
not to support toxic tribalism is
actually kind of a refreshing thing to

2737
01:54:42,411 --> 01:54:43,700
just be like,
like,

2738
01:54:43,701 --> 01:54:46,250
we're not competing for a man.
We're not competing for a job.

2739
01:54:46,251 --> 01:54:47,510
We're actually going to unite.
Like,

2740
01:54:47,780 --> 01:54:49,980
I think there's just some people,
there's something that kind of healing

2741
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:51,380
about that.
At least for now.

2742
01:54:51,530 --> 01:54:52,880
Yeah,
I agree with

2743
01:54:52,900 --> 01:54:53,400
dot.
I've,

2744
01:54:53,400 --> 01:54:58,400
I've experienced women confiding in me
about other women in comedy and there

2745
01:54:59,631 --> 01:55:03,720
are so shitty and judgmental and
critical.

2746
01:55:03,750 --> 01:55:05,610
Yeah.
Like I've had women say things about

2747
01:55:05,611 --> 01:55:06,750
other women comedians.
I'm like,

2748
01:55:06,751 --> 01:55:07,620
what,
wait a minute.

2749
01:55:07,890 --> 01:55:09,330
You,
you really think she's like that?

2750
01:55:09,350 --> 01:55:09,961
Yeah.
Like,

2751
01:55:09,961 --> 01:55:10,320
yeah.
Oh,

2752
01:55:10,320 --> 01:55:12,030
she's a fucking hatch.
She's fucking terrible.

2753
01:55:12,031 --> 01:55:12,960
And this now I'm like,
wait a minute,

2754
01:55:12,961 --> 01:55:13,794
wait a minute,
wait a minute.

2755
01:55:13,890 --> 01:55:14,910
She is funny.
Like,

2756
01:55:14,911 --> 01:55:15,870
what are you talking about?
No,

2757
01:55:15,890 --> 01:55:18,030
no.
They'll get really angry about it and

2758
01:55:18,031 --> 01:55:20,460
like,
like what is it like what is that like?

2759
01:55:20,461 --> 01:55:21,120
What is that?

2760
01:55:21,120 --> 01:55:22,990
I you complex.
Like there's,

2761
01:55:22,991 --> 01:55:26,980
there can only be one woman each show
and it's fucking her or me.

2762
01:55:27,160 --> 01:55:28,030
Or it's like,
you know,

2763
01:55:28,031 --> 01:55:29,860
and that's like a primal thing of
course.

2764
01:55:29,861 --> 01:55:32,410
Cause it's like I want protection from
the man cause of whatever.

2765
01:55:32,411 --> 01:55:34,450
There's all that sort of like old
primordial shed.

2766
01:55:34,630 --> 01:55:36,520
But competition between women like I
have,

2767
01:55:36,610 --> 01:55:41,350
this is the first time I'm kind of not
feeling that and it's kind of Nice for

2768
01:55:41,351 --> 01:55:43,380
the moment.
Um,

2769
01:55:43,410 --> 01:55:44,151
and we'll see.
Cause I,

2770
01:55:44,151 --> 01:55:46,020
I definitely know even though I think
that,

2771
01:55:46,230 --> 01:55:48,000
you know,
women are,

2772
01:55:48,330 --> 01:55:50,400
my concern,
I don't remember who I was talking about

2773
01:55:50,401 --> 01:55:53,070
this the other day is that basically
people are just going to stop hiring

2774
01:55:53,071 --> 01:55:55,170
women or stop hiring mixed,
like putting,

2775
01:55:55,230 --> 01:55:57,870
mixing people gender is up in offices
because it's just too scary.

2776
01:55:57,871 --> 01:56:01,350
I'm concerned and I'm concerned there's
going to be a little bit of a backlash

2777
01:56:01,590 --> 01:56:05,490
that guys are smoking dope.
It's not worth hiring a woman because

2778
01:56:05,491 --> 01:56:06,540
it's just going to be a nightmare.
I mean,

2779
01:56:06,541 --> 01:56:08,010
I know a lot of guys who are like,
I'm not,

2780
01:56:08,011 --> 01:56:11,010
I never hire pretty assistance or I'll
never hire a pretty girl to be in my

2781
01:56:11,011 --> 01:56:13,170
office because I'm just too scared the
way men are gonna Act,

2782
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:15,810
which I think is a little crazy and
unfortunate,

2783
01:56:15,811 --> 01:56:16,980
but it's like,
but it's true.

2784
01:56:17,010 --> 01:56:18,000
No one wants to get sued.

2785
01:56:18,190 --> 01:56:20,260
Well it's not just,
no one wants to get sued.

2786
01:56:20,261 --> 01:56:23,680
You change the office dynamic.
If you have a really hot assistant and

2787
01:56:23,681 --> 01:56:26,290
she's walking around with all these
other guys in the office and the other

2788
01:56:26,291 --> 01:56:28,570
guys in the office like getting their
cups of coffee,

2789
01:56:29,920 --> 01:56:30,700
Matt,
Sarah,

2790
01:56:30,700 --> 01:56:35,530
her assistant and his men recognize that
like when I see a god it's like skis it

2791
01:56:35,531 --> 01:56:37,360
on a check and like Ah,

2792
01:56:37,820 --> 01:56:40,550
well if you have need an intern or
something and you have two women that

2793
01:56:40,551 --> 01:56:45,500
are equally qualified and one is
overweight and 55 and one is 22 and

2794
01:56:45,501 --> 01:56:47,660
gorgeous.
I don't know how that can be equally

2795
01:56:47,661 --> 01:56:50,630
qualified but whatever.
Like who are you going higher or you

2796
01:56:50,631 --> 01:56:51,171
kind of like,
Oh,

2797
01:56:51,171 --> 01:56:52,970
this is a liability.
Those could be a problem.

2798
01:56:53,610 --> 01:56:56,070
Well,
the 55 year old lady might be fucking

2799
01:56:56,071 --> 01:57:01,071
crazy and the know how to use dropbox.
She might be like really interested in,

2800
01:57:01,950 --> 01:57:03,990
you know,
some of the things that we're interested

2801
01:57:03,991 --> 01:57:05,490
in.
Make it easier to talk to her.

2802
01:57:06,060 --> 01:57:10,680
Or it could be the opposite of the 55
year old might be wise and you know,

2803
01:57:10,681 --> 01:57:14,610
very calm to be around it and you can't
like that's a good the individual.

2804
01:57:14,730 --> 01:57:18,000
I just need to mirror visual.
Oh my corporation or if your NBC or if

2805
01:57:18,001 --> 01:57:19,780
you're Disney or something.
I know there are a lot of conversation.

2806
01:57:19,781 --> 01:57:20,420
Yeah.

2807
01:57:20,420 --> 01:57:22,420
Oh,
like potential liability.

2808
01:57:22,480 --> 01:57:24,310
If someone has a 55 year old intern,
it's like,

2809
01:57:24,311 --> 01:57:26,560
well don't you need money?
Well that's a red flag in your money.

2810
01:57:26,590 --> 01:57:27,520
Yeah,
that's right.

2811
01:57:27,740 --> 01:57:30,280
I'm just,
I'm just a PA on the show that I was on

2812
01:57:30,281 --> 01:57:32,830
wants news 39 and I was like,
wait a minute,

2813
01:57:32,860 --> 01:57:35,680
why are you,
you're a PA and you're 39 and he turned

2814
01:57:35,681 --> 01:57:38,530
out to be out fucking nuts.
And he was on pills.

2815
01:57:38,620 --> 01:57:39,453
Oh No.
He was on.

2816
01:57:39,690 --> 01:57:40,523
He was like,
I'm like,

2817
01:57:40,540 --> 01:57:43,210
do I had to tell people I go,
do you see the way he's moving?

2818
01:57:43,410 --> 01:57:45,700
Like he turns really quickly.
I go,

2819
01:57:45,701 --> 01:57:48,120
that guy's on speed.
There's 100% and then you go,

2820
01:57:48,140 --> 01:57:50,170
they were like,
you sure I go watch him.

2821
01:57:50,320 --> 01:57:51,400
I go watch him.
He's,

2822
01:57:51,401 --> 01:57:53,190
he's twitchy,
swiveling around.

2823
01:57:53,200 --> 01:57:55,780
He's always talking.
He can never shut the fuck up.

2824
01:57:55,781 --> 01:57:58,630
He interrupts conversations and he
injects with these long,

2825
01:57:58,631 --> 01:58:03,130
boring stories of his own guys on speed.
100% 39 year old intern.

2826
01:58:03,131 --> 01:58:05,260
They fired him.
They want to firing him like right after

2827
01:58:05,261 --> 01:58:06,760
this one job that we did.
But that was like,

2828
01:58:06,910 --> 01:58:07,743
okay.

2829
01:58:08,200 --> 01:58:09,310
It was tricky though.
I've just,

2830
01:58:09,311 --> 01:58:11,890
I've talked to a bunch of people who are
like bosses and they're like,

2831
01:58:12,130 --> 01:58:13,540
fine,
I'll just stop hiring women.

2832
01:58:13,630 --> 01:58:14,250
Oh,
that's crazy.

2833
01:58:14,250 --> 01:58:15,160
And it's like,
Oh God,

2834
01:58:15,161 --> 01:58:15,971
that's cool.
Other kids,

2835
01:58:15,971 --> 01:58:18,190
they're just so afraid of getting sued
and they're so afraid of interoffice

2836
01:58:18,250 --> 01:58:21,370
relationships and that sort of shift.
So it's good backfire.

2837
01:58:21,570 --> 01:58:24,570
I am too free.
I'm to free to have input on this.

2838
01:58:24,600 --> 01:58:24,980
It's,
uh,

2839
01:58:24,980 --> 01:58:25,801
it's,
you know,

2840
01:58:25,801 --> 01:58:29,430
I think there's a weird dynamic when men
and women work together and you have a

2841
01:58:29,431 --> 01:58:32,010
really hilarious bit about it.
Like people working in an office

2842
01:58:32,011 --> 01:58:33,240
together like that,
they,

2843
01:58:33,690 --> 01:58:35,970
the way they interact with each other,
it's very strange.

2844
01:58:35,971 --> 01:58:38,280
Like honey badgers in a fucking cage,
which is weird.

2845
01:58:38,310 --> 01:58:39,060
Yeah.
It's like your,

2846
01:58:39,060 --> 01:58:41,980
this is your new family.
You're with

2847
01:58:41,980 --> 01:58:45,400
these people eight hours a day and the,
you're only asleep for five and then you

2848
01:58:45,460 --> 01:58:46,690
get,
you know what I'm saying?

2849
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:49,060
How long do you see your wife every day?
No.

2850
01:58:49,160 --> 01:58:50,290
Two hours.
Maybe.

2851
01:58:51,100 --> 01:58:54,070
It's fucking weird.
Then you're in traffic for three,

2852
01:58:54,190 --> 01:58:55,610
right?
So like what,

2853
01:58:55,720 --> 01:58:58,510
what are you doing?
Like your life is these people and so

2854
01:58:58,511 --> 01:59:03,511
then your sexual situation gets weird
because helping bonds with them,

2855
01:59:03,731 --> 01:59:05,470
trauma bonds,
especially people

2856
01:59:05,730 --> 01:59:08,880
that never fuck,
but they want to fuck forever and they

2857
01:59:08,881 --> 01:59:11,490
just hug each other a little and they're
sweet to each other for it,

2858
01:59:11,491 --> 01:59:14,160
but nothing ever comes of it.
But they both know,

2859
01:59:14,370 --> 01:59:17,070
they both know they really want to fuck,
but they're not going to.

2860
01:59:17,071 --> 01:59:20,430
So they kind of a little flirty and a
little affectionately.

2861
01:59:20,431 --> 01:59:22,680
Yeah,
and they exchange the silly text

2862
01:59:22,681 --> 01:59:26,340
messages and then the wife will find out
this is an inappropriate emotional

2863
01:59:26,341 --> 01:59:27,510
relationship.
And you're like,

2864
01:59:27,511 --> 01:59:28,344
well what does that mean,

2865
01:59:28,440 --> 01:59:29,700
friends?
Yeah,

2866
01:59:31,150 --> 01:59:34,150
my work husband type thing.
I've had that sort of step off of that.

2867
01:59:34,180 --> 01:59:36,430
People do have,
I've had for people to openly talk about

2868
01:59:36,640 --> 01:59:38,260
their work husband,
I was like,

2869
01:59:38,261 --> 01:59:39,940
Whoa,
this is dark.

2870
01:59:39,941 --> 01:59:42,350
I mean I remember with Chris Taleah I
was doing a show that Chris,

2871
01:59:42,360 --> 01:59:46,630
Leah and we would spend all day together
every day and we were like having this

2872
01:59:46,870 --> 01:59:49,540
relationship.
I mean we're also acting his girlfriend

2873
01:59:49,541 --> 01:59:51,610
and boyfriend and we were sort of super
bonded.

2874
01:59:51,611 --> 01:59:53,410
And then because you spend all day
talking to each other,

2875
01:59:53,411 --> 01:59:55,180
confiding in each other,
sharing all these experiences,

2876
01:59:55,360 --> 01:59:57,130
by the time you get home,
do your actual boyfriend and you're

2877
01:59:57,131 --> 01:59:57,964
like,
can I?

2878
01:59:59,170 --> 02:00:01,960
And then you and then a month later I'm
like,

2879
02:00:01,961 --> 02:00:04,120
because remember when that director
yelled at me and they're like,

2880
02:00:04,121 --> 02:00:04,841
no.
And it's like,

2881
02:00:04,841 --> 02:00:06,160
I thought I told you,
you don't listen to me.

2882
02:00:06,161 --> 02:00:08,140
You don't understand me.
It's only because I've invested

2883
02:00:08,141 --> 02:00:11,020
everything and that other person that
all of a sudden it starts driving a

2884
02:00:11,021 --> 02:00:14,110
wedge between you and your actual,
so what you're supposed to do in

2885
02:00:14,111 --> 02:00:17,140
relationships is keep everything and
hold it.

2886
02:00:17,170 --> 02:00:20,050
It's like not ejaculating basically
emotionally.

2887
02:00:20,051 --> 02:00:22,450
It's like hold,
like if something crazy happens to me at

2888
02:00:22,451 --> 02:00:24,010
work,
I don't confide in someone at work.

2889
02:00:24,011 --> 02:00:26,230
I have to wait till I get home and bore
the shit out of my boyfriend.

2890
02:00:26,280 --> 02:00:30,330
I know this dude who is a very funny guy
and he brings this woman on the road

2891
02:00:30,331 --> 02:00:32,130
with them and when he brings this woman
on the road with him,

2892
02:00:32,131 --> 02:00:35,790
his wife freaks.
She does like it.

2893
02:00:35,850 --> 02:00:38,010
Yeah.
He's got a woman opening act and his

2894
02:00:38,340 --> 02:00:40,410
wife is fucking freaking.

2895
02:00:41,030 --> 02:00:45,620
Do you truly think I'm all for female
opening acts?

2896
02:00:45,621 --> 02:00:49,130
Obviously panicking.
Um,

2897
02:00:49,610 --> 02:00:52,860
do you think he has any interest in it?
No,

2898
02:00:52,910 --> 02:00:53,960
he just wants to,
I mean,

2899
02:00:53,961 --> 02:00:55,370
I support having a,
she's nice.

2900
02:00:55,400 --> 02:00:57,410
She's funny.
She's a good comic.

2901
02:00:57,620 --> 02:00:59,350
And he has her open forum.
Yeah,

2902
02:00:59,420 --> 02:01:01,160
I used to open for,
yeah,

2903
02:01:01,400 --> 02:01:02,980
I mean it's totally possible.
Yeah.

2904
02:01:03,540 --> 02:01:04,380
But,
uh,

2905
02:01:04,890 --> 02:01:06,000
you know,
it's that thing,

2906
02:01:06,060 --> 02:01:06,631
you know,
you're,

2907
02:01:06,631 --> 02:01:08,860
you're experiencing this thing that she
can,

2908
02:01:08,910 --> 02:01:09,550
no,
she's,

2909
02:01:09,550 --> 02:01:11,320
the wife is not a comedian.
That's another thing.

2910
02:01:11,321 --> 02:01:15,550
I think comics also have a bond that I
feel like the outside person can never

2911
02:01:15,551 --> 02:01:17,910
totally understand as well.

2912
02:01:18,350 --> 02:01:21,200
Way We joke around with each other.
Like if just the things you and I have

2913
02:01:21,201 --> 02:01:22,090
said to each other.
Yeah.

2914
02:01:22,130 --> 02:01:24,050
If we said these things in an office,

2915
02:01:24,220 --> 02:01:26,470
Holy Shit,
human resources,

2916
02:01:26,690 --> 02:01:27,920
it would both go to jail.
Yeah.

2917
02:01:29,110 --> 02:01:31,780
I think you'd go to jail more than me.
I am the worst.

2918
02:01:31,781 --> 02:01:35,170
But thank God that NBC lost it.
Those friends writers made a lot of

2919
02:01:35,171 --> 02:01:37,080
progress for us.
Okay.

2920
02:01:37,081 --> 02:01:38,830
So there's this famous lawsuit on
friends.

2921
02:01:38,831 --> 02:01:40,760
The writer's assistant sued

2922
02:01:40,850 --> 02:01:44,000
the writers in the writer's room because
they were saying something about the

2923
02:01:44,001 --> 02:01:48,470
actresses are sang like fucking them
with twigs or I think something crazy.

2924
02:01:48,980 --> 02:01:50,510
And um,
they sued,

2925
02:01:50,600 --> 02:01:52,730
uh,
the writer's assistant sued the writers

2926
02:01:52,731 --> 02:01:57,110
for sexual harassment and said I to hear
all this disgusting Shit and the writers

2927
02:01:57,111 --> 02:01:58,700
one,
because they said it was part of our

2928
02:01:58,701 --> 02:01:59,630
creative process.

2929
02:01:59,910 --> 02:02:01,950
But it is,
it certainly is.

2930
02:02:01,951 --> 02:02:05,160
And especially with Comedians,
we have said ridiculous shit to each

2931
02:02:05,161 --> 02:02:06,030
other.
Yeah.

2932
02:02:06,031 --> 02:02:08,760
I mean like,
well we just like guys,

2933
02:02:08,820 --> 02:02:12,270
first of all,
I callan Adelia mean that we will said

2934
02:02:12,330 --> 02:02:13,700
ridiculous shit.
Yes.

2935
02:02:13,720 --> 02:02:16,300
Like about each other off like like a
lot.

2936
02:02:16,320 --> 02:02:18,330
How loud?
Fuck you do the weird fuck you bro.

2937
02:02:18,331 --> 02:02:21,580
First of all,
I'm a top me,

2938
02:02:21,581 --> 02:02:23,370
I'm a top.
You're just going to give in.

2939
02:02:23,400 --> 02:02:24,450
You're just going to give in,
you know,

2940
02:02:24,451 --> 02:02:27,720
spinning your hand,
rub it on your butt and we will do that

2941
02:02:27,721 --> 02:02:31,830
to each other because it's how we make
each other laugh that we need something

2942
02:02:31,831 --> 02:02:35,160
really extreme in completely forbidden
to make each other laugh.

2943
02:02:35,190 --> 02:02:37,320
That's correct.
I think that is so fascinating.

2944
02:02:37,321 --> 02:02:39,690
I think Comedians,
we just have to go off the grid a little

2945
02:02:39,691 --> 02:02:41,430
bit every now and then.
Just too much porn.

2946
02:02:41,490 --> 02:02:43,440
Right?
Which is we need gags and fucking

2947
02:02:43,441 --> 02:02:46,530
Mascara running and fucking belt around
your neck.

2948
02:02:46,770 --> 02:02:50,620
We need the whole thing.
We need gagging to record the

2949
02:02:50,621 --> 02:02:51,250
conversation.

2950
02:02:51,250 --> 02:02:54,140
We have a certain threshold of
adrenaline we need or something.

2951
02:02:54,141 --> 02:02:55,770
Yeah.
When I get around calm it take,

2952
02:02:55,771 --> 02:02:56,600
it took

2953
02:02:56,600 --> 02:02:59,390
all long to delineate the difference
between like how to act around comics

2954
02:02:59,391 --> 02:03:02,450
and how to act around human beings.
And I also think like part of the reason

2955
02:03:02,451 --> 02:03:03,950
I'm a little manic when I first see a
comic,

2956
02:03:03,951 --> 02:03:05,840
it's like a puppy seeing its own or I'm
just like,

2957
02:03:06,570 --> 02:03:08,450
I know you just get so excited that I
get to be like,

2958
02:03:08,470 --> 02:03:09,770
ah,
bitch gon fuck.

2959
02:03:09,771 --> 02:03:11,970
Like I get to be.
Um,

2960
02:03:12,590 --> 02:03:14,630
yeah.
When you get to be free and I feel like

2961
02:03:14,631 --> 02:03:16,790
I spent all day just be more,
don't say that.

2962
02:03:16,791 --> 02:03:17,570
Don't say that.
Don't say it.

2963
02:03:17,570 --> 02:03:18,410
Yeah.
What's our,

2964
02:03:18,530 --> 02:03:20,960
our culture,
the culture of,

2965
02:03:21,320 --> 02:03:22,640
of comedy,
standup comedy.

2966
02:03:22,641 --> 02:03:23,900
It's very unusual.
Yeah.

2967
02:03:24,200 --> 02:03:26,600
There's the community.
It's one of the reasons why I'm very

2968
02:03:26,601 --> 02:03:30,220
protective of that community and it's
one of the things that I've thought was

2969
02:03:30,221 --> 02:03:31,160
the,
you know,

2970
02:03:31,340 --> 02:03:33,650
one of the things I've said about this
whole Louis C k thing,

2971
02:03:33,651 --> 02:03:36,650
I'm like,
he did it to one of us.

2972
02:03:36,670 --> 02:03:38,590
You did it to us.
It wasn't him.

2973
02:03:38,600 --> 02:03:41,900
Not that he should do it to anybody that
doesn't want to be a jerk off in front

2974
02:03:41,901 --> 02:03:42,734
of them.
Yup.

2975
02:03:42,850 --> 02:03:46,430
But it's,
I don't think fighters are interns on

2976
02:03:46,431 --> 02:03:49,370
our writing staff are the same as
standard too,

2977
02:03:49,371 --> 02:03:50,181
right?
Yeah.

2978
02:03:50,181 --> 02:03:52,220
It's like standups is one thing kind of
thing.

2979
02:03:52,430 --> 02:03:53,870
You just had a thing you'd like to beat
off,

2980
02:03:53,900 --> 02:03:55,820
pick on someone your own size.
You know what I mean?

2981
02:03:55,821 --> 02:03:58,640
Come shirt off in front of me.
You know what I mean?

2982
02:03:58,820 --> 02:04:01,680
Now as a 35 year goal,
I would love to see that.

2983
02:04:01,960 --> 02:04:04,670
And apparently he did do that to some
comedians and they laughed and he

2984
02:04:04,671 --> 02:04:05,740
thought it was funny.
Yeah.

2985
02:04:05,760 --> 02:04:06,593
Yeah.

2986
02:04:08,450 --> 02:04:10,370
Well there's some women that he did that
too.

2987
02:04:10,480 --> 02:04:12,140
It didn't come out and they thought it
was funny,

2988
02:04:12,170 --> 02:04:13,970
but there's a difference between Lake,
oh my God,

2989
02:04:13,971 --> 02:04:15,080
what are you doing?
And like,

2990
02:04:15,390 --> 02:04:18,890
stop please.
And I could lose my job if I challenge

2991
02:04:18,891 --> 02:04:19,850
you,
you know?

2992
02:04:19,851 --> 02:04:20,631
Right.
There'll be,

2993
02:04:20,631 --> 02:04:21,920
nobody is doing that now.
Right.

2994
02:04:21,950 --> 02:04:23,630
No one's beaten up.
Put them anybody anymore.

2995
02:04:23,631 --> 02:04:26,570
I think that's over most likely.
You still,

2996
02:04:26,571 --> 02:04:28,580
there's still people scared to talk.
Right.

2997
02:04:28,640 --> 02:04:33,530
I guess I just am curious what the,
what the neurology is of being,

2998
02:04:33,740 --> 02:04:36,920
being able to get an erection when a
girl is going stop.

2999
02:04:37,080 --> 02:04:38,070
The worst is if he didn't

3000
02:04:38,070 --> 02:04:39,960
get an erection.
It's like three quarters hard.

3001
02:04:39,961 --> 02:04:44,961
Like that's your thing.
If a woman goes like being humiliated as

3002
02:04:45,841 --> 02:04:48,750
an aphrodisiac or shame,
I think it's driven by shame.

3003
02:04:48,751 --> 02:04:50,790
Yeah.
There's a lot of weird shit to that for

3004
02:04:50,791 --> 02:04:51,990
sure.
I don't know.

3005
02:04:52,490 --> 02:04:54,690
I don't know where to go.
Like I was reading this thing about

3006
02:04:54,691 --> 02:04:57,210
pedophiles and like I'm not supportive
of pedophiles,

3007
02:04:57,211 --> 02:05:01,020
but like if you are a pedophile and you
have horrible thoughts,

3008
02:05:01,200 --> 02:05:04,290
there's nowhere where you can go unless
you can afford therapy where you can

3009
02:05:04,291 --> 02:05:04,740
say,
hey,

3010
02:05:04,740 --> 02:05:07,890
I have some really fucked up thoughts
and I want to fuck a kid.

3011
02:05:08,100 --> 02:05:11,580
And because shame is the engine a
pedophilia and you have nowhere to go.

3012
02:05:11,581 --> 02:05:13,380
Or if you dukes go somewhere,
people are going to go,

3013
02:05:13,470 --> 02:05:14,790
Ooh,
you're disgusting.

3014
02:05:15,180 --> 02:05:18,390
And they have nowhere to quell that
shame and stop the cycle.

3015
02:05:18,540 --> 02:05:19,920
Right.
And then if you act on it,

3016
02:05:19,921 --> 02:05:21,900
then you have more shame and then it
just makes it worse.

3017
02:05:22,050 --> 02:05:24,450
And most pedophiles were molested,
right?

3018
02:05:24,451 --> 02:05:28,140
So it's this just this fucked up cycle
and there's no social acceptable place

3019
02:05:28,141 --> 02:05:30,210
to go express that.
The wave in Aa you can go,

3020
02:05:30,211 --> 02:05:32,580
Hey I want a drink or I want to do drugs
or whatever.

3021
02:05:32,581 --> 02:05:35,020
There's no like place for them to go.
Yeah.

3022
02:05:35,040 --> 02:05:40,040
And it's also because it's your,
your thing is victimizing children,

3023
02:05:40,380 --> 02:05:42,330
right?
Like the zero tolerance for that

3024
02:05:42,390 --> 02:05:43,890
anywhere.
And people want to kill you.

3025
02:05:44,220 --> 02:05:45,810
They literally think you should be
killed,

3026
02:05:46,050 --> 02:05:49,260
but there shouldn't be a place like aa
or somewhere where you go to go.

3027
02:05:49,261 --> 02:05:52,680
Like how would we know if it even works?
That's the problem.

3028
02:05:52,690 --> 02:05:55,650
I know what works.
Bullets smell what's in your head,

3029
02:05:55,920 --> 02:05:57,270
what's in your head work.
Correct.

3030
02:05:57,970 --> 02:05:59,160
Someone's a kid.
Fuck.

3031
02:05:59,161 --> 02:06:02,910
How do you feel about the fact that if
you are a pedophile that means someone

3032
02:06:02,911 --> 02:06:06,630
molested you and you weren't.
You were a victim at some point as

3033
02:06:06,631 --> 02:06:09,660
victims become perpetrator.
So it's like how do you break that cycle

3034
02:06:09,661 --> 02:06:13,200
without just constantly shaming people
cause then you shame them into isolation

3035
02:06:13,201 --> 02:06:18,201
and isolation is where shame thrives.
Maybe one day we'll have some sort of a

3036
02:06:18,211 --> 02:06:23,090
form of therapy that can literally erase
inclinations and that can erase surgery.

3037
02:06:23,340 --> 02:06:25,890
That fucking takes out.
Oh that's what they were trying to do

3038
02:06:25,891 --> 02:06:27,830
right when they were like,
yeah,

3039
02:06:27,960 --> 02:06:29,040
great,
bring those back.

3040
02:06:31,090 --> 02:06:34,060
Like what ever you have to do with a
drill and fucking,

3041
02:06:34,490 --> 02:06:35,700
but it's like,
cause when you see,

3042
02:06:35,701 --> 02:06:38,670
I mean I was reading about the dark web
is the deep web or the dark dark.

3043
02:06:38,850 --> 02:06:43,850
I'm a hundred years old,
but like 90% of it is child pornography

3044
02:06:44,850 --> 02:06:46,080
and you're just like,
there's so many.

3045
02:06:46,081 --> 02:06:51,081
Like what the fuck it makes me homicidal
hero cop.

3046
02:06:52,080 --> 02:06:55,570
This guy was like a hero cop got his arm
blown off and it was like being,

3047
02:06:55,740 --> 02:07:00,740
and then they just caught them child
porn like Oh fuck no fucking vegas

3048
02:07:02,251 --> 02:07:04,110
shooter apparently had a bunch of child
porn.

3049
02:07:04,600 --> 02:07:05,610
Not surprised.
Yeah.

3050
02:07:05,670 --> 02:07:06,481
You know,
so it's like,

3051
02:07:06,481 --> 02:07:09,930
but like to stop that cycle is just so
it's like the same idea of like jerking

3052
02:07:09,931 --> 02:07:14,250
off on someone and being turned on by
them being scared,

3053
02:07:14,610 --> 02:07:16,740
being sexually aroused by a woman,
being scared.

3054
02:07:16,741 --> 02:07:18,180
There's something fucking going on
there.

3055
02:07:18,181 --> 02:07:20,490
And I dunno if its nature,
if it's nurture or if it's fucking

3056
02:07:20,491 --> 02:07:23,670
viking shit.
The pedophile thing is also,

3057
02:07:23,671 --> 02:07:27,120
it's such a forbidden topic that no one
even wants to express any sort of

3058
02:07:27,121 --> 02:07:29,730
sympathy for those people at all.
You don't want to be thought of as a

3059
02:07:29,731 --> 02:07:31,920
pedophilia sympathizer.
Correct?

3060
02:07:32,430 --> 02:07:34,320
Correct.
It's almost like a thing that you can't

3061
02:07:34,321 --> 02:07:35,730
fix.
Like they're the,

3062
02:07:35,980 --> 02:07:40,680
the recidivism rate is so high.
If there's a way to,

3063
02:07:40,681 --> 02:07:42,460
if it's an adult technically and
addiction,

3064
02:07:42,490 --> 02:07:44,740
I mean I think it's probably a mental
illness or if some sort of trauma

3065
02:07:44,741 --> 02:07:46,990
therapy because those people are
traumatized.

3066
02:07:47,020 --> 02:07:48,940
Right?
So if you're addicted to cigarettes,

3067
02:07:48,990 --> 02:07:49,890
yeah.
And uh,

3068
02:07:49,900 --> 02:07:53,230
you go through therapy and you kick them
and then you get back on the cigarettes

3069
02:07:53,231 --> 02:07:54,550
10 years later,
I don't care.

3070
02:07:54,910 --> 02:07:59,410
But if you're addicted to fucking kids
and then you live and then another kid

3071
02:07:59,440 --> 02:08:02,860
gets fucked because you couldn't keep it
together anymore.

3072
02:08:02,880 --> 02:08:03,880
Yeah,
I'm not,

3073
02:08:03,881 --> 02:08:05,720
I'm not willing to take that risk and
that's,

3074
02:08:05,980 --> 02:08:08,770
that becomes a real problem.
Especially someone who has young

3075
02:08:08,771 --> 02:08:12,130
children.
That freaks me the fuck out.

3076
02:08:12,131 --> 02:08:15,880
And I like most fathers who are hearing
my voice thinking about this right now,

3077
02:08:15,881 --> 02:08:17,010
I want to murder.
Yeah,

3078
02:08:17,140 --> 02:08:19,720
I just want to take that person out of
the food chain.

3079
02:08:19,750 --> 02:08:22,090
And that's,
you don't want to take that risk.

3080
02:08:22,120 --> 02:08:23,470
And I guess the one thing I would say is
like,

3081
02:08:23,471 --> 02:08:27,460
people you know have a lot of sympathy
for children who are molested or victims

3082
02:08:27,461 --> 02:08:30,010
of pedophiles until they grow up.
You know,

3083
02:08:30,011 --> 02:08:33,700
like a lot of women who are victims of
that ended up manifesting as the women

3084
02:08:33,701 --> 02:08:36,020
who can say no or the women who are
like,

3085
02:08:36,250 --> 02:08:37,820
you know,
traumatized and,

3086
02:08:37,821 --> 02:08:41,860
and freeze up and stuff like that.
But those women hypersexual that's the

3087
02:08:41,861 --> 02:08:43,340
other thing.
Torn stars.

3088
02:08:43,730 --> 02:08:47,440
A lot of women that get involved in the
adult industry were molested as

3089
02:08:47,441 --> 02:08:49,120
children.
Like a giant percentage.

3090
02:08:49,790 --> 02:08:52,480
What I say is all of them.
I don't want to say it's all of them

3091
02:08:52,481 --> 02:08:54,700
cause I know there's a lot of women that
do it just because they enjoy it and

3092
02:08:54,701 --> 02:08:57,550
that's totally cool.
But there were a lot,

3093
02:08:57,910 --> 02:09:00,670
there was,
there was some survey they did once,

3094
02:09:00,880 --> 02:09:01,960
what?
Back in the day.

3095
02:09:01,961 --> 02:09:03,520
And it was some alarming number.

3096
02:09:05,530 --> 02:09:07,160
Right.
A lot of people can never come to the,

3097
02:09:07,170 --> 02:09:09,220
to come to terms with that.
I was talking to a therapist who was

3098
02:09:09,221 --> 02:09:10,870
saying something about,
um,

3099
02:09:11,140 --> 02:09:14,050
plastics.
A lot of people that get crazy plastic

3100
02:09:14,051 --> 02:09:17,830
surgery do it because they were molested
and they're trying to change their face.

3101
02:09:17,831 --> 02:09:20,050
So when they look in the mirror,
it's not the person that got molested.

3102
02:09:20,170 --> 02:09:22,150
What they thought about Michael Jackson
and really?

3103
02:09:22,151 --> 02:09:23,650
Yeah.
That was one of the big theories about

3104
02:09:23,651 --> 02:09:25,750
Michael Jackson is his father abused
him.

3105
02:09:26,260 --> 02:09:28,930
Yeah.
You know my theory about Michael Jackson

3106
02:09:28,931 --> 02:09:30,640
telling me,
don't say it again,

3107
02:09:30,670 --> 02:09:33,340
tell me everything.
I think he's a Castrato.

3108
02:09:33,790 --> 02:09:36,670
I think he had his balls removed.
I think that's why his voice was so

3109
02:09:36,671 --> 02:09:39,040
high.
That was a common thing that used to do

3110
02:09:39,041 --> 02:09:40,630
with singers.
Really?

3111
02:09:40,660 --> 02:09:43,390
Yeah.
You ever heard of [inaudible] music,

3112
02:09:44,170 --> 02:09:45,940
but is she going to teach Whitney
Cummings?

3113
02:09:46,960 --> 02:09:49,680
They used to do that with opera singers
more than I do.

3114
02:09:50,290 --> 02:09:52,890
You know a lot of shit.
No,

3115
02:09:52,960 --> 02:09:55,890
I'm not to eat cookies while we're doing
it.

3116
02:09:56,770 --> 02:10:00,190
There's no sugar in those.
I'm so hungry.

3117
02:10:00,200 --> 02:10:01,240
Yeah.
There's very little,

3118
02:10:01,270 --> 02:10:03,350
those are no cookies.
They have very little sugar.

3119
02:10:03,360 --> 02:10:06,200
The glycaemic index on those as
extremely low,

3120
02:10:06,590 --> 02:10:08,530
get hungry.
I don't understand it cause my body

3121
02:10:08,531 --> 02:10:11,020
burns fat.
I eat very little carbohydrates.

3122
02:10:11,110 --> 02:10:14,620
Like this morning I ate eggs and a fat
beef.

3123
02:10:14,621 --> 02:10:18,360
So you never have life sugar spike or
sugar dips because you don't eat.

3124
02:10:18,361 --> 02:10:20,260
You have any spikes?
No,

3125
02:10:20,261 --> 02:10:23,170
I'm eating fat most of the time.
I mean he fat in meat.

3126
02:10:23,950 --> 02:10:24,880
That's what I eat.
Mostly.

3127
02:10:25,290 --> 02:10:26,920
God,
I need to just regroup here.

3128
02:10:26,980 --> 02:10:30,640
I need to start from it's way healthier.
It's way better cognitively.

3129
02:10:30,700 --> 02:10:34,280
This is what I don't get mentally this
way.

3130
02:10:34,310 --> 02:10:36,260
I take four naps a day.
I don't think any now.

3131
02:10:36,930 --> 02:10:38,670
It was always so fucking tire.

3132
02:10:38,810 --> 02:10:41,270
Well I'm on Beta blockers to,
I think that's a whole other thing.

3133
02:10:41,330 --> 02:10:42,890
But you're on Beta blockers,
Beta blockers,

3134
02:10:43,110 --> 02:10:46,910
Beta blockers.
I get really bad migraines and it's

3135
02:10:46,911 --> 02:10:48,590
hormonal.
But I think I figured that out.

3136
02:10:48,970 --> 02:10:50,660
Uh,
I lead a blockers are supposed to keep

3137
02:10:50,661 --> 02:10:52,010
you from getting nervous.
Yeah.

3138
02:10:52,011 --> 02:10:56,030
It stops like adrenaline,
I think from what I've understand,

3139
02:10:56,990 --> 02:11:01,760
I know a lot of archers use that test
for it because when you're on the like

3140
02:11:01,820 --> 02:11:05,180
an archery competitions and the nerves
will make you shaky.

3141
02:11:05,720 --> 02:11:09,320
So I produced a lot of adrenaline and
cortisol at the tiniest things cause I'm

3142
02:11:09,321 --> 02:11:11,450
a fucking trauma surgeon.
Every damn hug.

3143
02:11:11,451 --> 02:11:16,010
Women don't want to hug you.
I'm a fucking bad.

3144
02:11:16,340 --> 02:11:19,760
And so I was getting really bad
migraines because of my neuro chemical

3145
02:11:19,761 --> 02:11:21,320
spikes.
I would get too much adrenaline and too

3146
02:11:21,321 --> 02:11:24,240
much cortisol when I get nervous.
So I take two Beta blockers a day.

3147
02:11:25,310 --> 02:11:29,810
I'm a catch Jesus.
You had your balls cut off today would

3148
02:11:29,900 --> 02:11:33,020
be your place,
the way you're developing.

3149
02:11:33,021 --> 02:11:34,730
They do it to a boy when they're very
young.

3150
02:11:34,750 --> 02:11:38,330
There's actually recordings of cast
Trados from like the early 19 hundreds

3151
02:11:38,870 --> 02:11:41,150
see if you can get that.
What surgeon does?

3152
02:11:41,460 --> 02:11:43,550
Jamie got us pulled off youtube before.
Oh,

3153
02:11:43,640 --> 02:11:44,990
did it?
I'll pull it from there.

3154
02:11:44,991 --> 02:11:45,970
So,
oh wait,

3155
02:11:46,490 --> 02:11:48,880
because it's like um,
child porn.

3156
02:11:48,900 --> 02:11:49,401
No,
no,

3157
02:11:49,401 --> 02:11:50,810
no.
Because it's a,

3158
02:11:51,080 --> 02:11:54,740
because the recording,
it gets flagged by Youtube as being

3159
02:11:54,741 --> 02:11:57,560
their proprietary or their property,
their property.

3160
02:11:57,561 --> 02:12:01,250
And so anything that you use that
someone else's stuff can get you pulled

3161
02:12:01,251 --> 02:12:04,250
off of youtube.
You know like there's a shit load of

3162
02:12:04,251 --> 02:12:07,850
people out there that have like these
nature videos.

3163
02:12:07,851 --> 02:12:10,190
There's a big one we get,
it gives us pulled all the time.

3164
02:12:10,390 --> 02:12:12,790
Yeah.
People that own things for it.

3165
02:12:13,160 --> 02:12:14,490
Like the way you would license
something,

3166
02:12:14,500 --> 02:12:15,920
you would,
you could do something like that or you

3167
02:12:15,921 --> 02:12:18,560
could give them your ad revenue,
but you'd have to give them like all the

3168
02:12:18,561 --> 02:12:20,190
ad revenue from a show.
Yeah,

3169
02:12:20,960 --> 02:12:23,240
it's insane.
So like if we played a clip from the

3170
02:12:23,241 --> 02:12:25,700
office and we played it and you could
see it on the show,

3171
02:12:25,730 --> 02:12:27,790
we would totally get flagged and pull
them.

3172
02:12:28,580 --> 02:12:31,790
And if it happens more than one time,
you can lose your whole channel.

3173
02:12:34,380 --> 02:12:38,630
You could argue it that it's fair use,
but you don't have a license to do it.

3174
02:12:38,631 --> 02:12:41,750
And if you're making money off of it,
it might not be considered fair use.

3175
02:12:41,780 --> 02:12:45,560
So listen to this sound with this sound
is that we're hearing,

3176
02:12:45,650 --> 02:12:47,180
and Jamie,
what is the name of this?

3177
02:12:50,750 --> 02:12:55,280
This is a young man who had his balls
removed and one of the things that

3178
02:12:55,281 --> 02:12:57,230
happens to them as they get older,
they,

3179
02:12:57,290 --> 02:12:59,720
they never really develop masculine
traits.

3180
02:12:59,930 --> 02:13:02,120
This guy got fat because he had no
testosterone,

3181
02:13:02,330 --> 02:13:07,330
no testosterone is no balls and so they
have this haunting high pitched,

3182
02:13:07,790 --> 02:13:11,990
almost female but not quite sound.
And it was a preferred sound.

3183
02:13:12,200 --> 02:13:17,200
So much so that they would take children
and sell them off and they would get

3184
02:13:17,271 --> 02:13:20,960
their balls cut off at a young age.
So they would develop to be cussed.

3185
02:13:20,961 --> 02:13:22,700
Strados can't handle things.

3186
02:13:23,170 --> 02:13:25,790
Yeah.
This is my thought about Michael

3187
02:13:25,790 --> 02:13:28,130
Jackson.
I think Michael Jackson's voice was so

3188
02:13:28,131 --> 02:13:31,940
high.
It was so high pitched and like falsetto

3189
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:34,050
was so pure.
I really,

3190
02:13:34,290 --> 02:13:36,660
I mean no one's going to know.
I mean there's no way to know,

3191
02:13:36,661 --> 02:13:39,180
but I'm a retard and I have my own
thoughts.

3192
02:13:39,510 --> 02:13:40,710
These are,
these are my thoughts.

3193
02:13:40,790 --> 02:13:43,530
The surgeon who did that surgery after
he dies,

3194
02:13:43,531 --> 02:13:46,950
why aren't I coming forward and getting
$5 million for this story?

3195
02:13:47,430 --> 02:13:49,560
Because that surgeon's going to go to
fucking jail.

3196
02:13:50,040 --> 02:13:53,550
You do that shit in America for saint to
took a kid,

3197
02:13:53,640 --> 02:13:55,770
cut his balls off.
You can't do that.

3198
02:13:56,400 --> 02:13:58,380
It might not even be real.
I might just be a stupid person.

3199
02:13:58,381 --> 02:13:59,880
It was a dumb idea,
which is more likely.

3200
02:14:00,180 --> 02:14:02,430
No,
I think it's a pretty good explanation.

3201
02:14:02,460 --> 02:14:03,660
I mean weird,
right?

3202
02:14:04,610 --> 02:14:07,200
Children.
They didn't sound anything like that.

3203
02:14:07,580 --> 02:14:09,750
You hear Jermaine Jackson saying he
sounds like a man.

3204
02:14:10,020 --> 02:14:11,730
Michael Jackson never sounded like come
down.

3205
02:14:12,630 --> 02:14:13,740
Yeah.
It was all weird.

3206
02:14:13,900 --> 02:14:14,820
Fishy.
The well,

3207
02:14:14,821 --> 02:14:19,560
it's also the abuse that he suffered as
a child and his incredible connection to

3208
02:14:19,561 --> 02:14:22,350
children.
This bizarre connections you get

3209
02:14:22,351 --> 02:14:23,070
stunted.
Yeah.

3210
02:14:23,070 --> 02:14:23,520
What?
Jamie?

3211
02:14:23,520 --> 02:14:27,810
The doctor that killed him or was in
jail for killing them wrote in a book

3212
02:14:27,811 --> 02:14:30,870
that his parents had him chemically
castrated.

3213
02:14:31,650 --> 02:14:33,180
Oh,
like taking those real,

3214
02:14:33,280 --> 02:14:34,620
sorry.
I mean that's what he wrote in a book.

3215
02:14:34,621 --> 02:14:37,130
I'm reading on some New Zealand new sub.
I don't know how

3216
02:14:37,200 --> 02:14:39,020
I could they do that.
They done that to trauma.

3217
02:14:39,021 --> 02:14:41,160
Lester's they've do.
They do that to trauma loss is to giving

3218
02:14:41,161 --> 02:14:42,780
them the option.
Oh,

3219
02:14:42,781 --> 02:14:46,560
so that you don't know Michael Jackson
chemically castrated by parents claims.

3220
02:14:46,561 --> 02:14:49,640
Dr t this is my fucking theory.
Damn,

3221
02:14:49,670 --> 02:14:51,730
and I'm writing.
I Bet I'm right.

3222
02:14:51,990 --> 02:14:53,010
I Bet I'm right.
Well,

3223
02:14:53,020 --> 02:14:54,900
the also his children were in his
children,

3224
02:14:55,020 --> 02:14:57,060
right?
He's a heterosexual man,

3225
02:14:57,061 --> 02:15:01,620
but heinous things happen to Michael in
his lifetime that actually changed or

3226
02:15:01,770 --> 02:15:04,680
had him morph into who he thought he
was.

3227
02:15:04,830 --> 02:15:06,510
One of those things,
according to Murray,

3228
02:15:06,660 --> 02:15:09,450
was his parents are arranging for his
chemical castration.

3229
02:15:09,630 --> 02:15:13,290
His testes were never remove,
but injections were given to Michael

3230
02:15:13,290 --> 02:15:16,080
Jackson to maintain.
His voice is high pitched voice of a

3231
02:15:16,081 --> 02:15:20,160
child that went long beyond puberty.
He places much of the blame for

3232
02:15:20,161 --> 02:15:23,550
Jackson's extrordinary but difficult
life at the feet of his family.

3233
02:15:23,551 --> 02:15:24,960
I fucking knew it,
so let me ask you.

3234
02:15:24,961 --> 02:15:27,450
It was right.
That stops testosterone production like

3235
02:15:27,480 --> 02:15:30,120
what's given to kids on are
transitioning and that sort of thing.

3236
02:15:30,150 --> 02:15:32,430
You're done.
That's why he was so skinny.

3237
02:15:32,820 --> 02:15:34,590
He never,
when he was a child,

3238
02:15:35,130 --> 02:15:38,750
they did that to him as a child.
Teen boys can you still go?

3239
02:15:38,751 --> 02:15:39,930
You still grow.
Women are tall.

3240
02:15:39,931 --> 02:15:41,100
You're tall.
You're taller than me.

3241
02:15:41,740 --> 02:15:42,780
Lot of Gmos.

3242
02:15:43,380 --> 02:15:44,360
That's why.
No,

3243
02:15:44,361 --> 02:15:47,550
it's just a different genes that didn't,
it doesn't stop you from growing tall

3244
02:15:47,551 --> 02:15:49,950
stops your muscles from developing.
Oh,

3245
02:15:49,951 --> 02:15:51,420
but and,
and then what does that have to do with

3246
02:15:51,421 --> 02:15:53,160
the vocal cords?
Cause something about your vocal cords.

3247
02:15:53,161 --> 02:15:56,160
Testosterone changes your voice.
That's why when a woman turns into a

3248
02:15:56,161 --> 02:15:59,130
transgender man,
their voice becomes a different food.

3249
02:16:00,600 --> 02:16:02,160
Is that legal?
No,

3250
02:16:03,930 --> 02:16:06,370
it's all legal.
Chemically castrate though.

3251
02:16:06,740 --> 02:16:10,220
It's fucking crazy because that's the,
that we talked about this in Roseanne.

3252
02:16:10,490 --> 02:16:11,490
It's doctors,
right?

3253
02:16:11,790 --> 02:16:13,770
If that doctor's right.
And I bet he is right.

3254
02:16:14,250 --> 02:16:15,840
If you wrote about this.
I bet he's right.

3255
02:16:15,870 --> 02:16:17,850
He self published it too.
Just what does that mean?

3256
02:16:17,851 --> 02:16:20,670
No one's giving them bucktail cause the
fuck's gonna give it a factual book deal

3257
02:16:20,671 --> 02:16:22,760
to the guy who killed Michael Jackson
idea.

3258
02:16:24,390 --> 02:16:25,390
Hello.
No,

3259
02:16:25,391 --> 02:16:26,250
they didn't.
They took it away.

3260
02:16:26,340 --> 02:16:27,810
Oh did they get there and he lost it.

3261
02:16:27,960 --> 02:16:30,910
He lost his book deal.
When the thing came out about a Hetero,

3262
02:16:31,090 --> 02:16:34,120
him thinking that it's okay for young
boys to have sex with gay men.

3263
02:16:34,150 --> 02:16:35,570
Not Great,
not great,

3264
02:16:35,600 --> 02:16:38,290
not a great brand.
Community has a different take on that.

3265
02:16:38,770 --> 02:16:40,240
Yeah,
they have a different take on it.

3266
02:16:40,241 --> 02:16:42,580
Then the straight community,
the idea of gay,

3267
02:16:42,581 --> 02:16:46,840
young gay boys having sex with gay men,
it doesn't bother them in the same way

3268
02:16:46,841 --> 02:16:47,890
with a lot.
I'm not,

3269
02:16:48,040 --> 02:16:50,620
obviously I'm not speaking for the
community and I don't want to

3270
02:16:50,621 --> 02:16:54,010
generalize,
but the reactions that I've had from gay

3271
02:16:54,011 --> 02:16:56,350
friends that talk about it say it's way
more common.

3272
02:16:56,380 --> 02:16:58,330
Huh?
Well that was the Bryan singer thing

3273
02:16:58,600 --> 02:17:00,340
that Brian Senior had those parties at
his house.

3274
02:17:00,341 --> 02:17:02,200
We had a whole pool full of fucking gay
kid

3275
02:17:02,290 --> 02:17:05,710
and Morrissey also demanded Kevin Spacey
about it and I'm like,

3276
02:17:05,711 --> 02:17:07,300
it's a difference.
Yeah,

3277
02:17:07,390 --> 02:17:10,690
exactly.
Like how like how do you know if you're

3278
02:17:10,960 --> 02:17:13,510
17 and like we were just talking about
the power dynamic.

3279
02:17:13,511 --> 02:17:14,980
How do you even know you're trying to
figure out who you are.

3280
02:17:14,990 --> 02:17:17,350
You're looking for a father figure or
you abused yourself.

3281
02:17:17,351 --> 02:17:19,180
It's like we just,
we don't know until they grow up and

3282
02:17:19,181 --> 02:17:21,340
figure it out in therapy.
If it was really conceptual.

3283
02:17:21,760 --> 02:17:22,250
Yeah.

3284
02:17:22,250 --> 02:17:27,250
I mean it's weird that we put this
arbitrary date to like 18 arbitrary,

3285
02:17:27,370 --> 02:17:29,060
right?
Well you can go to war now you're 18

3286
02:17:29,061 --> 02:17:33,020
like what?
I figured out it's 32 who I was when,

3287
02:17:33,021 --> 02:17:35,030
when she should be allowed to vote.
I say 50.

3288
02:17:35,240 --> 02:17:36,073
I say

3289
02:17:38,050 --> 02:17:39,650
didn't really,
um,

3290
02:17:40,140 --> 02:17:41,730
yeah,
I mean it's so it's like,

3291
02:17:41,731 --> 02:17:42,810
I mean,
you know,

3292
02:17:43,080 --> 02:17:46,290
should you be allowed to drive?
I drove like a maniac when I was young.

3293
02:17:47,190 --> 02:17:50,010
I just never should have had a car until
I was like 23 years old.

3294
02:17:50,070 --> 02:17:52,300
When should you be able to drink?
When should you be to at all,

3295
02:17:52,350 --> 02:17:53,310
if at all?
Yeah,

3296
02:17:53,311 --> 02:17:54,780
it's a good question.
It's terrifying.

3297
02:17:54,840 --> 02:17:57,690
And once you be able to have kids,
that's a good question too because you

3298
02:17:57,691 --> 02:18:01,770
only do it for a certain amount of time
and by the time you can't do it anymore,

3299
02:18:01,771 --> 02:18:03,000
that's when you finally know what you're
doing.

3300
02:18:03,780 --> 02:18:06,540
I feel like I'm 35 years old.
I finally am qualified to be a mother

3301
02:18:06,541 --> 02:18:09,150
and this is when you stopped being
physically capable than nuts.

3302
02:18:09,450 --> 02:18:11,460
Do you have a couple more years?
We can still shoot one out.

3303
02:18:12,450 --> 02:18:15,960
I have,
I have my shits on ice,

3304
02:18:15,961 --> 02:18:18,120
so I think I might have,
I might have more time,

3305
02:18:18,150 --> 02:18:20,640
but you have to find someone that you
would really raise a kid with.

3306
02:18:21,150 --> 02:18:23,460
Very different.
I have to find the perfect nanny.

3307
02:18:25,370 --> 02:18:29,370
No,
I have a guy that I think is a plus and

3308
02:18:29,371 --> 02:18:31,030
if he's not,
I'll just give the child to you.

3309
02:18:31,470 --> 02:18:33,220
You seem to maybe doing a pretty good
job.

3310
02:18:33,240 --> 02:18:34,980
Raise them,
raise them in the forest.

3311
02:18:35,360 --> 02:18:36,900
I mean,
and then you said it's just like it.

3312
02:18:36,950 --> 02:18:39,810
That's a very real fear.
I'm finally for the first time like,

3313
02:18:39,840 --> 02:18:41,640
Oh God,
I have to get my shit together on that,

3314
02:18:41,641 --> 02:18:43,530
but then I get super scared about this
world.

3315
02:18:43,531 --> 02:18:45,240
I'm like,
do I want to bring kids into this world

3316
02:18:47,060 --> 02:18:50,100
today
with all the books and medicine and

3317
02:18:50,101 --> 02:18:53,400
shit?
People were shitting kitchen floors.

3318
02:18:53,730 --> 02:18:56,460
That's why we're here to have water in
20 years.

3319
02:18:56,510 --> 02:18:57,343
Yeah,
we'll have water.

3320
02:18:57,710 --> 02:18:58,860
Yeah,
we're going to figure this out.

3321
02:18:58,880 --> 02:18:59,970
Can you be drinking salt water,

3322
02:19:00,210 --> 02:19:01,710
panicking,
freaking out.

3323
02:19:01,711 --> 02:19:06,711
But that's also why we correct things.
I think the technology ingenuity and I

3324
02:19:07,051 --> 02:19:11,430
also think is ironically as it seems,
a guy like Donald Trump as president is

3325
02:19:11,431 --> 02:19:16,431
going to really activate people.
They're going to start moving in liquid

3326
02:19:16,861 --> 02:19:20,730
at this fucking women's March.
Big Part of that is having to grab the

3327
02:19:20,731 --> 02:19:24,360
pussy president had to get this bad in
order for us to wake the fuck up because

3328
02:19:24,361 --> 02:19:26,130
we were all zombies.
Sleep walkers.

3329
02:19:26,160 --> 02:19:27,920
He's the reason why those pussy hats

3330
02:19:28,040 --> 02:19:30,650
that by the way,
whoever's making a wind fall off those

3331
02:19:30,651 --> 02:19:34,130
goddamn puts me out.
They should be thanking Dora people down

3332
02:19:34,131 --> 02:19:36,860
there.
Sally knows how to make pussy hats like

3333
02:19:36,861 --> 02:19:39,170
me.
What if he is behind the selling of

3334
02:19:39,171 --> 02:19:39,831
that?
Yeah,

3335
02:19:39,831 --> 02:19:41,060
no,
it was amazing to see all the

3336
02:19:41,061 --> 02:19:43,170
commercialization of it and everybody
capital I know

3337
02:19:43,690 --> 02:19:48,460
going to make us much more appreciative
of the environmental protection agency

3338
02:19:48,880 --> 02:19:50,140
and then the,
the,

3339
02:19:50,170 --> 02:19:53,680
all the restrictions at Obama put an
offshore drilling if anything goes

3340
02:19:53,681 --> 02:19:54,480
wrong.
Yeah.

3341
02:19:54,480 --> 02:19:56,830
Cause he's just opened up offshore
drilling everywhere.

3342
02:19:56,831 --> 02:19:57,550
You know that,
right?

3343
02:19:57,550 --> 02:19:59,610
Yeah.
Do you know what he's done and what he's

3344
02:19:59,611 --> 02:20:01,840
done?
I've heard that he's done a lot of

3345
02:20:01,841 --> 02:20:05,080
really crazy things with the environment
and with state,

3346
02:20:05,350 --> 02:20:07,000
with um,
you know,

3347
02:20:07,001 --> 02:20:08,920
uh,
whether it's bureau of land management

3348
02:20:08,921 --> 02:20:10,900
areas or um,
uh,

3349
02:20:10,930 --> 02:20:13,120
W W I don't know which,
which organization.

3350
02:20:13,300 --> 02:20:18,300
There's definitely state land that was
public land that's now being diminished

3351
02:20:18,591 --> 02:20:21,070
to state parks.
They're now being diminished and they're

3352
02:20:21,071 --> 02:20:24,790
opening them up from mining.
They're opening them up for extraction

3353
02:20:24,791 --> 02:20:26,380
of minerals and resources.
Yeah.

3354
02:20:26,650 --> 02:20:31,480
And all this is close to rivers and
watersheds and all these different areas

3355
02:20:31,481 --> 02:20:34,700
that are very important for different
ECOSYS tines.

3356
02:20:34,740 --> 02:20:36,370
Terrifying,
terrifying stuff.

3357
02:20:36,371 --> 02:20:37,950
In terms of the future,
Delaware,

3358
02:20:38,230 --> 02:20:40,030
well,
there's earthquakes in Oklahoma all the

3359
02:20:40,031 --> 02:20:44,050
time now that never used to happen.
And all that's directly attributed to

3360
02:20:44,051 --> 02:20:46,270
fracking.
They're drilling these giant holes in

3361
02:20:46,271 --> 02:20:49,660
the ground and pumping all this water in
there and fluids and all this shit they

3362
02:20:49,661 --> 02:20:51,160
used for fracking.
It's,

3363
02:20:51,640 --> 02:20:53,950
it's,
it's going to energize people and get

3364
02:20:53,951 --> 02:20:57,430
people to understand that the,
there's real consequences to just

3365
02:20:57,431 --> 02:21:01,780
thinking about money and yeah.
Also how ridiculous it is that a guy who

3366
02:21:01,781 --> 02:21:05,170
has more money than he could ever
fucking possibly spend is only thinking

3367
02:21:05,171 --> 02:21:09,700
about money in his thigh is in his mind,
he's thinking about America.

3368
02:21:09,730 --> 02:21:12,870
He's thinking about people prospering
and getting jobs and this not,

3369
02:21:12,910 --> 02:21:16,510
but clearly it's not just that,
it's clear it clearly there's some

3370
02:21:16,511 --> 02:21:19,480
personal profit that's being extracted
from all this.

3371
02:21:19,481 --> 02:21:20,270
And of course,
yeah.

3372
02:21:20,270 --> 02:21:20,550
Well,
yeah,

3373
02:21:20,550 --> 02:21:21,480
it's like his people,
it,

3374
02:21:21,481 --> 02:21:22,140
his hiring,
you know,

3375
02:21:22,140 --> 02:21:23,610
and look,
and I love Oprah.

3376
02:21:23,611 --> 02:21:26,160
She's a delight.
But for the left to go like,

3377
02:21:26,340 --> 02:21:28,920
let's have old purvi president and bcs
twitter page.

3378
02:21:29,130 --> 02:21:31,710
This is our president and Kendra letter.
No,

3379
02:21:31,740 --> 02:21:32,561
our president.
No,

3380
02:21:32,561 --> 02:21:33,390
no,
no oprah.

3381
02:21:33,390 --> 02:21:36,750
Let's hire another celebrity who isn't
qualified to be the breath.

3382
02:21:36,950 --> 02:21:39,120
Wasn't it oprah?
I just wasn't telling anybody.

3383
02:21:39,490 --> 02:21:42,390
Do you guys remember the secret?
Remember the fucking secrets?

3384
02:21:42,391 --> 02:21:42,991
Yeah,
go back.

3385
02:21:42,991 --> 02:21:45,630
And when oprah was telling everybody you
could have anything you want,

3386
02:21:45,631 --> 02:21:48,650
you just kind of imagine it
like,

3387
02:21:49,400 --> 02:21:51,060
well,
like fuck,

3388
02:21:51,061 --> 02:21:52,620
are we watching?
He's just,

3389
02:21:52,621 --> 02:21:54,850
it's not great to also be like,
hey,

3390
02:21:54,851 --> 02:21:57,180
let's have this other celebrity be
president.

3391
02:21:57,600 --> 02:21:59,880
Wonderful Lady in her fault.
I don't have anything

3392
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,460
problem with Oprah,
but I just think what we should have is

3393
02:22:02,461 --> 02:22:07,461
someone who is extremely educated,
who is incredibly nuanced and well

3394
02:22:08,521 --> 02:22:13,290
thought out opinions and things and
someone who's got a really good grasp of

3395
02:22:13,291 --> 02:22:14,930
what it takes to run it.
Yeah,

3396
02:22:15,220 --> 02:22:19,000
let's stop electing rich celebrities to
run our country.

3397
02:22:19,001 --> 02:22:20,950
Tried it didn't work.
It didn't work out so well.

3398
02:22:21,010 --> 02:22:23,170
Well you know,
or an oil

3399
02:22:23,170 --> 02:22:24,020
man.
Yeah,

3400
02:22:24,100 --> 02:22:26,400
maybe it worked out if in the mining
industry

3401
02:22:26,490 --> 02:22:28,710
and then it's like just tricky.
It's like the idea of being like,

3402
02:22:28,711 --> 02:22:30,420
I don't think oprah should be our next
president is like,

3403
02:22:30,421 --> 02:22:32,460
well you're sexist.
It's like Jesus fucking Christ.

3404
02:22:32,490 --> 02:22:33,810
You're racist.
No I'm not.

3405
02:22:33,811 --> 02:22:36,840
It's like we should be able to say we
don't think certain people are

3406
02:22:36,841 --> 02:22:39,210
qualified.
Stop yelling at me.

3407
02:22:39,360 --> 02:22:43,400
Do you read your comments on instagram?
Should I just stop and you never do so

3408
02:22:43,530 --> 02:22:44,490
smart.
Rarely.

3409
02:22:45,030 --> 02:22:46,770
Very rarely.
Sometimes they'll look in and I'll see

3410
02:22:46,771 --> 02:22:48,480
someone that's a dick and I'll just
block them.

3411
02:22:48,780 --> 02:22:51,710
That's like what?
Cause I tried to like engage and like

3412
02:22:51,720 --> 02:22:55,200
try to like see what's going on but the
kind of shit or just too insane,

3413
02:22:55,201 --> 02:22:57,300
it's not worth that.
You just put out good things.

3414
02:22:57,301 --> 02:22:59,550
Try to be nice.
And is that a crazy person or is that a

3415
02:22:59,551 --> 02:23:02,340
person that masquerades as being sane
and then behind closed doors?

3416
02:23:02,340 --> 02:23:03,630
It's crazy.
It could be both.

3417
02:23:03,640 --> 02:23:04,980
A mix of both.
Could be both.

3418
02:23:05,040 --> 02:23:06,810
Um,
did you ever hear about that guy that

3419
02:23:06,811 --> 02:23:10,950
got fired from reddit and he was saying
awful shit on reddit and posting all

3420
02:23:10,951 --> 02:23:15,050
these terrible things and they found out
his personal identity and they uh,

3421
02:23:15,060 --> 02:23:19,020
went after him and then got him fired
from his job and it devastated his life.

3422
02:23:19,021 --> 02:23:21,840
I think I was married with kids and it
takes life completely fell apart.

3423
02:23:21,860 --> 02:23:25,710
Yeah.
People enjoy being a con anonymously.

3424
02:23:25,711 --> 02:23:27,810
They enjoy it.
One of the things that I found on

3425
02:23:27,811 --> 02:23:29,520
instagram,
if someone says something really

3426
02:23:29,521 --> 02:23:31,110
particularly heinous,
you'd go to,

3427
02:23:31,111 --> 02:23:33,900
their pays are almost always private.
They're almost always have like a

3428
02:23:33,901 --> 02:23:38,040
blocked page because they're cowards.
There's just a lot of like very deeply

3429
02:23:38,041 --> 02:23:41,250
unhappy people that will lash out at
anybody that's in the public spotlight

3430
02:23:41,520 --> 02:23:43,710
like you.
Especially a woman.

3431
02:23:43,830 --> 02:23:47,460
Crazy question.
If a man this happened to someone I

3432
02:23:47,461 --> 02:23:50,790
know,
if a man is engaging with relationships

3433
02:23:51,570 --> 02:23:55,200
with other women on the Internet as a
character,

3434
02:23:55,410 --> 02:23:57,060
is it cheating?
No,

3435
02:23:57,420 --> 02:23:59,860
it's just he's picked,
he's having a character's.

3436
02:24:00,650 --> 02:24:03,540
Yeah.
Well who is he an artist is you're right

3437
02:24:03,541 --> 02:24:05,380
or no,
no.

3438
02:24:05,700 --> 02:24:07,110
Didn't have,
you know,

3439
02:24:07,170 --> 02:24:11,140
just sort of pretty adrenaline free job.
Yeah.

3440
02:24:11,160 --> 02:24:13,950
He's probably fucking completely bored
out of his mind and it gives them a

3441
02:24:13,951 --> 02:24:15,300
chart.
Is it like a video game?

3442
02:24:15,680 --> 02:24:18,000
Cause I was like,
this feels kind of like a video game in

3443
02:24:18,001 --> 02:24:19,440
a little,
in a little bit of a way.

3444
02:24:19,441 --> 02:24:20,790
It is.
It's role playing.

3445
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:22,620
You know,
it's like a simulation.

3446
02:24:22,790 --> 02:24:24,600
Right?
And a little bit way it's just being

3447
02:24:24,601 --> 02:24:25,490
deceptive.
Right?

3448
02:24:25,590 --> 02:24:28,110
Maybe it's fantasy wishes he was someone
different.

3449
02:24:28,640 --> 02:24:32,250
Yeah.
Like is that if your wife has online as

3450
02:24:32,251 --> 02:24:36,630
a different person aging with men and
the pictures of her own pussy,

3451
02:24:37,830 --> 02:24:39,760
that's when it gets weird dicey.
Right.

3452
02:24:39,870 --> 02:24:41,310
Pussy flying through the air.

3453
02:24:44,010 --> 02:24:45,990
Literally,
you know who's here.

3454
02:24:45,991 --> 02:24:49,960
This is what's going to win flashlights.
I wonder if the same of flashlights,

3455
02:24:50,050 --> 02:24:53,100
it's going to go on robots.
That's what's going to win sex.

3456
02:24:53,101 --> 02:24:54,300
Robots.
Robots.

3457
02:24:54,360 --> 02:24:57,120
Totally.
They're closing in to your point about

3458
02:24:57,121 --> 02:24:58,590
the right,
do you think that that also works a

3459
02:24:58,591 --> 02:25:00,470
muscle of to humanizing,
yes.

3460
02:25:00,910 --> 02:25:03,120
Yeah,
and also changes your reward system.

3461
02:25:03,121 --> 02:25:07,400
Like instead of like learning to be an
interesting charismatic person who's

3462
02:25:07,410 --> 02:25:12,060
caring and kind and reaping the rewards
of real relationships with people that

3463
02:25:12,061 --> 02:25:15,840
care about you and you care about them
and understanding real true love instead

3464
02:25:15,841 --> 02:25:17,880
of that you're fucking this robot I not
like,

3465
02:25:18,240 --> 02:25:19,860
is it cheating?
If he fucks a robot,

3466
02:25:19,861 --> 02:25:22,070
like I can't have that fight.
I can't,

3467
02:25:22,080 --> 02:25:23,980
can't do it.
Did you fuck

3468
02:25:23,980 --> 02:25:27,370
the robot or not?
I can't have that fight.

3469
02:25:27,580 --> 02:25:30,400
I can't do this.
What do you know?

3470
02:25:31,060 --> 02:25:32,410
Did He fucked the rob telling me the
truth?

3471
02:25:32,411 --> 02:25:34,300
Look me in the eye and tell them you
didn't fuck Siri.

3472
02:25:34,610 --> 02:25:37,660
I can't.
Is a robot bad but a fleshlight okay.

3473
02:25:38,350 --> 02:25:39,850
Yeah,
cause there's no head.

3474
02:25:41,590 --> 02:25:44,380
If there's eyeballs,
it gets very dicey.

3475
02:25:44,980 --> 02:25:47,440
Fake robot.
The robot is just skin here.

3476
02:25:49,130 --> 02:25:52,180
Is She prettier than me?
I just want to make sure the robots have

3477
02:25:52,181 --> 02:25:53,830
wrinkles.
A couple of crow's feet.

3478
02:25:54,680 --> 02:25:56,280
Yes.
I don't want them being to it.

3479
02:25:56,290 --> 02:25:58,820
We got to make sure these robots,
Ooh,

3480
02:25:58,850 --> 02:26:00,100
we got it.
They giggle.

3481
02:26:00,101 --> 02:26:03,910
They laugh at your badge.
You have to make sure these robots

3482
02:26:03,911 --> 02:26:05,290
aren't too pretty.
They gotta be ugly.

3483
02:26:05,650 --> 02:26:07,390
It's not going to happen.
I'm going to be hot as fuck.

3484
02:26:07,391 --> 02:26:10,330
They're going to be perfect.
I don't like this one bit.

3485
02:26:10,540 --> 02:26:12,860
You posted that thing of that robot
jumping

3486
02:26:15,850 --> 02:26:17,500
schedule.
Many of them carry.

3487
02:26:17,530 --> 02:26:20,050
Was she that episode of Black Mirror
though?

3488
02:26:20,051 --> 02:26:23,080
One metal head.
The new ones I haven't seen.

3489
02:26:23,081 --> 02:26:26,610
The new one.
New Season of black mirror is amazing.

3490
02:26:26,611 --> 02:26:29,880
Insane and one of the episodes has a
row,

3491
02:26:30,150 --> 02:26:32,920
a bunch of robots that are going after
people and it's called metal head.

3492
02:26:33,040 --> 02:26:36,670
I don't want to say anymore.
It's terrifying because very realistic

3493
02:26:36,970 --> 02:26:40,600
and t incredibly realistic and probably
represents something that's going to

3494
02:26:40,601 --> 02:26:42,640
exist in the future.
Or maybe it's going with the other way.

3495
02:26:42,641 --> 02:26:43,271
I'm to be like,
baby,

3496
02:26:43,271 --> 02:26:45,720
can you just fuck the robot tonight?
Maybe I'm tired.

3497
02:26:45,730 --> 02:26:47,620
That's when you know it's over eight,
two months.

3498
02:26:47,621 --> 02:26:49,930
Send them over to the robot that was on
your side.

3499
02:26:50,650 --> 02:26:53,150
Please don't,
don't impel Milo's maybe.

3500
02:26:53,151 --> 02:26:56,800
Maybe you'll allow him to fuck a robot,
but the robot has to look exactly like

3501
02:26:58,990 --> 02:27:02,320
you have a spare.
We'd get the robot.

3502
02:27:02,321 --> 02:27:03,520
We'd order it.
It would come in and be like,

3503
02:27:03,521 --> 02:27:04,720
is that what I look like?

3504
02:27:06,780 --> 02:27:08,590
And you'd put your hand up and just like
a mirror.

3505
02:27:08,591 --> 02:27:12,170
It would put its hand up and you'd both
like move perfectly in sync.

3506
02:27:13,140 --> 02:27:16,060
It was up to age with me though.
It would have to age.

3507
02:27:16,061 --> 02:27:18,550
It would have to get older.
When I get older to have to get wrinkles

3508
02:27:18,551 --> 02:27:22,150
and gray hairs and shit.
Trying to through the dirt look worse.

3509
02:27:22,151 --> 02:27:25,330
They're all Asian.
Did you see the Woman Grace Woo at the

3510
02:27:25,331 --> 02:27:27,110
barn?
Hello?

3511
02:27:27,790 --> 02:27:28,920
Hello?
Is that a dick?

3512
02:27:29,080 --> 02:27:34,080
I've never seen.
No,

3513
02:27:34,091 --> 02:27:38,020
I didn't see a woman at the march.
What actress named Grace Woo who talked

3514
02:27:38,021 --> 02:27:43,021
about sort of the Fed,
the Fetis fetishization of Asian women.

3515
02:27:44,350 --> 02:27:45,880
Get over a pitch.
She's bragging.

3516
02:27:46,090 --> 02:27:47,830
That's what she's doing.
She's bragging.

3517
02:27:48,030 --> 02:27:49,920
Everybody just had to fuck.
I'm so tired.

3518
02:27:50,220 --> 02:27:52,510
That's my thing of fucking free the
nipple.

3519
02:27:52,511 --> 02:27:55,480
I'm like,
only girls with great tits won a free

3520
02:27:55,481 --> 02:27:56,170
the net ball.

3521
02:27:56,170 --> 02:27:58,000
Now you're just,
you're just bragging.

3522
02:27:58,001 --> 02:27:58,834
Yeah.
No,

3523
02:27:59,350 --> 02:28:00,670
no.
Women in their forties or like,

3524
02:28:00,671 --> 02:28:03,010
let's free the nipple.
It's all like hot checks,

3525
02:28:03,400 --> 02:28:04,450
you know,
see what they're doing.

3526
02:28:04,490 --> 02:28:06,610
Yeah.
I don't want to free the nipple when he

3527
02:28:06,650 --> 02:28:07,600
comes this,
wrap this up.

3528
02:28:07,970 --> 02:28:10,420
Once you move you out.
February 9th,

3529
02:28:10,421 --> 02:28:12,550
the female brain.
It's about all of this shit.

3530
02:28:12,900 --> 02:28:14,560
Yeah.
It's about all of this sort of stuff.

3531
02:28:14,650 --> 02:28:15,580
Where would it be?
A,

3532
02:28:15,680 --> 02:28:18,070
it's going to be in movie theaters and
then it's going to be on Vod.

3533
02:28:18,100 --> 02:28:19,260
It's like,
uh,

3534
02:28:19,420 --> 02:28:22,310
got Blake Griffin will Sasso is in it.
Yeah.

3535
02:28:22,311 --> 02:28:25,280
Neal Brennan is hilarious.
Hilarious.

3536
02:28:25,281 --> 02:28:26,550
He's slick.
Steals here.

3537
02:28:26,840 --> 02:28:30,840
He has a scene with Blake Griffin where
he plays his physical therapist and it's

3538
02:28:31,410 --> 02:28:34,070
fucking hysterical.
I could not cut it.

3539
02:28:34,340 --> 02:28:35,630
Um,
it's really great.

3540
02:28:36,530 --> 02:28:39,950
What the Cummings Ladies and gentlemen,
give her a big hug.

3541
02:28:42,590 --> 02:28:43,110
Oh God.
