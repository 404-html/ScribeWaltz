1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,111
Try by day.

2
00:00:01,111 --> 00:00:03,810
Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,260
T mobile arena reserves for Mayweather,

4
00:00:07,261 --> 00:00:08,094
Mcgregor,

5
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:09,560
good sibling.

6
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:11,340
It's fucking happening.

7
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:12,750
How is that going to happen?

8
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,860
What do you mean how you think?

9
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,580
Do you think the UFC and may
were there come to an agreement?

10
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:18,210
Yes.

11
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,043
That's what's happening

12
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,800
is in coach with the UFC.

13
00:00:22,801 --> 00:00:23,330
Let's get,

14
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:24,870
I can't hear you as he's involved,

15
00:00:24,871 --> 00:00:25,501
but the report,

16
00:00:25,501 --> 00:00:25,881
who knows who,

17
00:00:25,881 --> 00:00:26,760
who made that report?

18
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,500
Pretty lucky.

19
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,710
Did you get it on the way over here?

20
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:30,263
I Made A.

21
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:31,740
I might have.

22
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:32,970
I think it's going to happen,

23
00:00:32,971 --> 00:00:33,390
man.

24
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:33,841
Wow.

25
00:00:33,841 --> 00:00:34,591
You really think so.

26
00:00:34,591 --> 00:00:35,424
I really do.

27
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,960
And you're asking me to come to own it.

28
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:38,360
So let's just figure this out.

29
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:39,180
Now you want to talk to you?

30
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,840
Just what do you do to probably companion?

31
00:00:42,841 --> 00:00:43,650
Oh Man,

32
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:44,580
I don't know man.

33
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:45,660
I don't know what I'm doing.

34
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:47,340
While if you're not commentating,

35
00:00:47,341 --> 00:00:51,870
we need you like giant companion for
it and celebrate the shit out of it.

36
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,130
I would prefer that.

37
00:00:53,131 --> 00:00:53,820
Honestly,

38
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,230
June 10th June 10th it's about to get
a lot of my man may whether throws you

39
00:00:58,231 --> 00:00:59,520
that TMT money.

40
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,540
I don't think they really
care about me commentating.

41
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,650
They'd probably want Max
Kellerman or of the boxing people.

42
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:07,120
Max Kellerman you boom.

43
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,070
It would be fun.

44
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:08,970
I would love to do it with them.

45
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,100
But that's what I,

46
00:01:10,101 --> 00:01:10,360
that's,

47
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,880
that's a boxing match,

48
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:12,361
you know,

49
00:01:12,361 --> 00:01:13,320
that's their world.

50
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:16,920
Even if it was him and a manager though
and he was sitting down next to me doing

51
00:01:16,921 --> 00:01:17,754
commentary,

52
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:21,480
you know that I think that would be a
little odd to not a Floyd was just doing

53
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:22,800
boxing the octagon.

54
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:23,750
You know what I'm saying?

55
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:24,910
You need to be an awesome,

56
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:25,681
well no,

57
00:01:25,681 --> 00:01:26,381
no I'm saying if,

58
00:01:26,381 --> 00:01:28,290
if the roles were reversed,

59
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:31,550
I think you could talk about
moving Connor's history cause they,

60
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:32,550
they're not going to know shit.

61
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:33,330
Let's be right.

62
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:33,991
They're going to be like,

63
00:01:33,991 --> 00:01:35,940
you know Shannon Sharpe talking about UFC,

64
00:01:35,941 --> 00:01:37,110
it's tough to listen to.

65
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:41,190
It's going to be good at on
who's knowledgeable breakdown
like commerce history,

66
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,151
how he came here.

67
00:01:42,151 --> 00:01:43,170
He got his movement,

68
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,220
what he's known for.

69
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,380
I think that's super important.

70
00:01:46,381 --> 00:01:48,420
You have to forgive people
who don't watch UFC.

71
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:48,781
Yeah.

72
00:01:48,781 --> 00:01:50,700
Cause you're getting a
shit load of new boxing.

73
00:01:50,701 --> 00:01:50,901
You know,

74
00:01:50,901 --> 00:01:51,540
it sounds fast.

75
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,110
Tune in,

76
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,040
hanging out with you guys.

77
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:53,671
Smoking weed,

78
00:01:53,671 --> 00:01:54,481
watching it right here.

79
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:55,740
That sounds so much better.

80
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:58,020
I just want my dear friend Joe Rogan,

81
00:01:58,021 --> 00:01:59,690
part of the biggest fight
of combat and history.

82
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,553
I'm good.

83
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,610
Like it's a big deal right here.

84
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,400
Cause you don't think that's
the biggest fight in his life.

85
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:08,990
Fighting history bigger than Ali Frazier.

86
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:09,330
Yes.

87
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:09,931
Number wise.

88
00:02:09,931 --> 00:02:10,220
Yeah.

89
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:10,460
Yeah.

90
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:11,190
It's the biggest,

91
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,800
biggest paper view ever because
it brings in two worlds.

92
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,280
It brings in the UFC world and this one
guy who was unquestionably the biggest

93
00:02:17,281 --> 00:02:18,000
star in the UFC,

94
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,760
unquestionably by a long shot.

95
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,540
And then you bring in a guy who has been
one of the biggest moneymakers in the

96
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:25,321
history of boxing,

97
00:02:25,321 --> 00:02:25,890
changed the game.

98
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:28,800
The only guy to go 49 and
no others in rocky Marciano.

99
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,490
I mean he's like right there and we'd
love to break rocky Marciano's record.

100
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:33,810
And then you know what,

101
00:02:33,811 --> 00:02:34,111
man,

102
00:02:34,111 --> 00:02:37,860
when people want to do things like break
someone's record and you want to do it

103
00:02:37,861 --> 00:02:41,760
so bad that you take on a guy who's
never had a boxing match before and then

104
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:42,780
that guy starches,

105
00:02:42,781 --> 00:02:43,614
you

106
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:45,810
know saying,

107
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:47,260
I mean it's not like does that,

108
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,870
I'm going to build a shrine to him,

109
00:02:48,871 --> 00:02:51,070
pray to whatever this summer
I'm going to get a tattoo.

110
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:51,601
Man.

111
00:02:51,601 --> 00:02:52,291
I'm telling you,

112
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:53,520
there's something about that dude.

113
00:02:53,521 --> 00:02:54,870
He's got something going on.

114
00:02:54,871 --> 00:02:55,351
Magic.

115
00:02:55,351 --> 00:02:57,240
He's got a little something extra special,

116
00:02:57,241 --> 00:02:58,074
but he would need,

117
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,070
he would everything to line up.

118
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:05,100
It would have to be the McGregor
Mayweather would have to dismiss him as a

119
00:03:05,831 --> 00:03:06,520
threat.

120
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,140
He'd have to not train hard enough.

121
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:11,560
He'd have to not seriously consider the
possibility that Connor connects on him

122
00:03:11,561 --> 00:03:12,394
and knocks him out.

123
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,270
Right.

124
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:16,300
And then Connor would have
to do some rough housing.

125
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:17,690
He would have to hold him.

126
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,350
He'd have to hold them and hit 'em.

127
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,100
You'd have to try to get off as many shots
and bullying around and wear him out.

128
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,360
It's a possibility.

129
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,320
It's a possibility.

130
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:27,850
He's a much bigger mass.

131
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,770
He's a much quicker manner.

132
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:30,820
Yeah,

133
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,151
very,

134
00:03:31,151 --> 00:03:31,691
very quick.

135
00:03:31,691 --> 00:03:33,610
But if you compare the
two of them frame wise,

136
00:03:33,611 --> 00:03:37,600
like what if they ever do
do it and they're standing
right at each other looking

137
00:03:37,601 --> 00:03:38,410
down at each other,

138
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:38,591
you know,

139
00:03:38,591 --> 00:03:39,341
do an eye to eye,

140
00:03:39,341 --> 00:03:39,850
you're going to go,

141
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:40,683
oh shit.

142
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:40,961
Yeah.

143
00:03:40,961 --> 00:03:41,920
Connor's way.

144
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:44,860
Because you remember when Eddie Alvarez
was going Idi with Connor and you

145
00:03:44,861 --> 00:03:46,240
realize how big Connor's head is.

146
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,330
He'll like Jesus,

147
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:48,780
we're just a bigger dude.

148
00:03:48,781 --> 00:03:49,660
Cause from shoulders,

149
00:03:49,661 --> 00:03:50,560
his legs,

150
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,910
he's a big fuck.

151
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:55,330
I mean he could make that 145 pound
cut when he was on death's door,

152
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,041
but may,

153
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:57,160
whether it makes it easy,

154
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:59,740
what are they going to fight
at 45 that's a good question.

155
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:00,340
No,

156
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,140
maybe there was fighting
at one 54 is like wow,

157
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,920
I bet they do it like 55 or 60 maybe.

158
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:06,590
Maybe.

159
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,530
Depends on what may was comfortable with,

160
00:04:08,531 --> 00:04:08,660
but,

161
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:08,920
but,

162
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,753
but I think the,

163
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:10,840
and Dana White,

164
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,430
you want to be part of that fight.

165
00:04:12,431 --> 00:04:15,310
If you're Dana let you want to be
in cahoots with all these guys with

166
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:16,413
Mayweather,

167
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:16,910
Floyd,

168
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:21,910
or you don't want the fight to take place
at all and book he's got fuck because

169
00:04:22,271 --> 00:04:23,051
number Grumet off,

170
00:04:23,051 --> 00:04:23,884
got sick,

171
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:24,820
making that weight.

172
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,410
If number get Madoff didn't get sick,

173
00:04:26,411 --> 00:04:27,244
making that weight,

174
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,740
then Neuroma Madoff and Tony Ferguson,

175
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:30,933
Dana White did.

176
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,680
Oh No,

177
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,300
doc did because look,

178
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:37,030
the real fight is the winner of,

179
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:37,660
uh,

180
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,300
Tony Ferguson and Habib
number good metal in the UFC.

181
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:40,601
Right.

182
00:04:40,601 --> 00:04:43,420
So that's the real fight is like
being a big challenge for Conor.

183
00:04:43,421 --> 00:04:44,830
And that could be a million plus paper.

184
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,153
Right?

185
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,433
It's basically,

186
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:47,951
if you,

187
00:04:47,951 --> 00:04:52,240
if you either have that fight or the
better fight financially is another fight

188
00:04:52,241 --> 00:04:52,990
with Nate Diaz.

189
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:53,231
No,

190
00:04:53,231 --> 00:04:55,420
the better fight financially
is may with Oh yeah,

191
00:04:55,421 --> 00:04:56,254
for sure.

192
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:57,443
For sure.

193
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:58,481
For sure.

194
00:04:58,481 --> 00:04:58,811
For sure.

195
00:04:58,811 --> 00:05:02,940
Connor has a business that's
by far the 100% agree with you.

196
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,420
What I was saying in 20 million,

197
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:07,450
way more than a hundred million
or a hundred by a hundred.

198
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,441
100 million each.

199
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:10,920
Lloyd to Ray Borg looks
good as far as he does.

200
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:11,913
He's so fast.

201
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:22,010
Okay.
