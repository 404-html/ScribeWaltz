1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,900
The joe rogan experience last
night set was particularly,

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:04,860
uh,

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:08,040
rich and ideas and some of the new
things that I've been working on are,

4
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:08,874
um,

5
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:10,410
there's a lot of stuff in,

6
00:00:10,411 --> 00:00:15,200
I'm worth on about this sort of a
weirdness of progressive thought later,

7
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:19,790
like this really aggressive
progressiveness that's
going on where people are

8
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:24,720
denying reality and they're doing it so
because they feel like people have been

9
00:00:24,721 --> 00:00:25,950
marginalized in the past,

10
00:00:25,951 --> 00:00:26,784
which is true,

11
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,100
but it doesn't mean you
spring it back the other way.

12
00:00:29,101 --> 00:00:30,260
You say bunch of stupid shit.

13
00:00:30,261 --> 00:00:31,140
It doesn't make any sense.

14
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:31,350
Oh,

15
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:33,530
you judge people too harshly
for judging people harshly.

16
00:00:33,531 --> 00:00:33,841
It's like,

17
00:00:33,841 --> 00:00:34,200
yeah.

18
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,040
How does that work,

19
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:35,430
right.

20
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,350
Getting people for hitting.

21
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:37,261
Exactly.

22
00:00:37,261 --> 00:00:37,980
Exactly.

23
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,020
Some of the most aggressive
people I know are liberals,

24
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:41,070
so it's really strange.

25
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:41,970
I mean,

26
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:43,520
there's an amazing video of,

27
00:00:43,521 --> 00:00:44,790
of University of Toronto,

28
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:49,020
of this guy who was speaking
about men's rights waterfowl.

29
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:49,760
Yeah,

30
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,593
yeah,

31
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:51,503
yeah.

32
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,520
These feminists are protesting these
students screaming in their face.

33
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:01,500
The students that want to go see
this man talk about women's of,

34
00:01:01,501 --> 00:01:05,760
about men's rights and about that you
hate women and all this and they're

35
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,620
incredibly aggressive.

36
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,470
The only hate IC is in the protesters,

37
00:01:09,471 --> 00:01:11,020
the only not going be,

38
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:12,300
and by the way,

39
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,090
incredibly ignorant to what this guy,

40
00:01:14,091 --> 00:01:15,150
his actual words are.

41
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,280
And they weren't even aware.

42
00:01:17,281 --> 00:01:19,200
They didn't even bother
doing the research.

43
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:23,250
They didn't even bother formulating a
true opinion on these this guy's ideas.

44
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:25,410
They just decided that
this guy hates women.

45
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:26,760
And that's a weird thing.

46
00:01:26,761 --> 00:01:31,761
Like I've had made some posts about
feminism on online before and one of the

47
00:01:31,771 --> 00:01:36,420
things that I've found it incredibly
strange is that I got called an Mra

48
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,263
asshole.

49
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:37,891
And so I go,

50
00:01:37,891 --> 00:01:38,250
what does that,

51
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:38,821
what does that mean?

52
00:01:38,821 --> 00:01:39,654
What's the Mra?

53
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:41,250
So that I had a very simplified English.

54
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,640
I didn't know what it meant at all.

55
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,800
It's men's rights advocate or activist.

56
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,090
Yeah,

57
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:48,923
we're activity.

58
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:49,560
And I was like,

59
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,520
wait a minute,

60
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,230
I'll feminist.

61
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,680
A person who wants equal rights for women
is saying that being a man who wants

62
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:02,310
equal rights for men is an idiot.

63
00:02:02,311 --> 00:02:05,260
Or I could call the Dodo
and Mra Dodo and like,

64
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:05,521
Oh,

65
00:02:05,521 --> 00:02:06,450
Jesus Christ.

66
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:07,050
Well,

67
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:07,400
Yoga,

68
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:07,540
well,

69
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,400
they had a compressive Socratic arguments.

70
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,340
I could call it MRI asshole.

71
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:12,343
[inaudible].

72
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:13,500
I didn't even know what an MRI,

73
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:13,681
I mean,

74
00:02:13,681 --> 00:02:17,400
I'm not immense rights advocate and
by any stretch of the imagination,

75
00:02:17,401 --> 00:02:18,870
I don't visit any blogs.

76
00:02:18,871 --> 00:02:20,370
I don't visit any forums,

77
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,430
but I'm a believer in equality.

78
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:22,810
Is,

79
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:27,300
is as far as like the laws and
regulations as they apply to human beings.

80
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:31,110
And I do not believe that the laws and
regulations as they apply to human beings

81
00:02:31,111 --> 00:02:34,470
in this country aren't even
for men as the art and women.

82
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,130
I don't think they're even for women
and I don't think they're even for men.

83
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:38,350
Yeah.

84
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:39,040
If an area,

85
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,350
forcible laws are fucking horrendous
for men and some of them are atrocious,

86
00:02:43,351 --> 00:02:44,280
some of them are Canada,

87
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:45,960
are God awful.

88
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,030
Dave Foley for the longest time,

89
00:02:48,031 --> 00:02:48,930
I don't know if he's resolved.

90
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:49,943
Horrible,

91
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,760
horrible.

92
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,170
Anybody who's listening to this,

93
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:53,850
just Google Day Foley,

94
00:02:53,851 --> 00:02:55,590
Joe Experience divorce.

95
00:02:55,591 --> 00:02:56,041
And there's a,

96
00:02:56,041 --> 00:03:00,250
there's a youtube video that someone
compiled of just him talks about his

97
00:03:00,251 --> 00:03:00,850
divorce.

98
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,410
He will make your head spin and,

99
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:07,030
and I know they'll probably be honest
TV because what he lost $10 million fund

100
00:03:07,031 --> 00:03:07,750
his last divorce.

101
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,230
Yeah,

102
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:08,920
yeah,

103
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,210
yeah.

104
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:10,420
Cause he said it's not alimony.

105
00:03:10,421 --> 00:03:11,254
It's all your money.

106
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,500
That's a,

107
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,090
it is.

108
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:13,480
It is.

109
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,170
It's insane.

110
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:14,920
It's insane.

111
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,270
And that's not fair.

112
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,051
It's not fair.

113
00:03:17,051 --> 00:03:18,190
I don't care what anybody says.

114
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,140
I think that absolutely.

115
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:21,780
If a man and woman get
divorced and manage,

116
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:22,600
get child support.

117
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,380
Absolutely.

118
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:26,530
And if the woman was not working
during the time of the marriage,

119
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,690
I think there should be
some sort of compensation.

120
00:03:28,691 --> 00:03:29,441
Something Fair.

121
00:03:29,441 --> 00:03:30,060
It's something recent.

122
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:30,211
Yeah.

123
00:03:30,211 --> 00:03:32,790
Some of the assets that he
developed by focusing on whatever.

124
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:33,001
Yeah,

125
00:03:33,001 --> 00:03:33,420
sure.

126
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,021
Absolutely.

127
00:03:34,021 --> 00:03:35,280
But that's a terrible payments.

128
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,653
That's just not right.

129
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:36,901
No,

130
00:03:36,901 --> 00:03:37,441
it's not.

131
00:03:37,441 --> 00:03:38,101
It's not right.

132
00:03:38,101 --> 00:03:40,770
And I have a friend who
has to pay his ex wife.

133
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,220
Um,

134
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:41,580
they were,

135
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,810
they were married for 12 years.

136
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,990
He has to pay her for the rest of
her life until she gets married.

137
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,160
So she plays this game.

138
00:03:47,161 --> 00:03:50,800
She has a boyfriend and the
boyfriend of her and he sends a,

139
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:54,450
the investigators over to figure it out
and the boyfriend's not there and then

140
00:03:54,451 --> 00:03:55,870
he leaves and the,

141
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,960
the rescuers leaving in the
boyfriend moves back in.

142
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,770
And so he has to continue paying her.

143
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:04,290
Like she's cohabitating with a man and
he still has to continue to send her

144
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:04,770
money.

145
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,450
And it's just a manipulation
of the legal system.

146
00:04:06,451 --> 00:04:09,210
And this guy has paid her millions
and millions and millions of dollars.

147
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:12,270
She's in his $4 million
Pacific Palisades home.

148
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:14,610
It crippled him financially.

149
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:17,620
And on top of that he had to pay
for her lawyer whether they want to,

150
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:20,340
it's gone through divorce and
here's where it gets really crazy.

151
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:23,940
She went to every lawyer in
town and consulted with them,

152
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:28,620
every good lawyer in town that she knew
of so that he could never use them as

153
00:04:28,621 --> 00:04:29,454
counsel.

154
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:29,761
Oh.

155
00:04:29,761 --> 00:04:31,150
Because they'd be conflict of interest.

156
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,720
But some madness.

157
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,550
I mean she planned it out.

158
00:04:35,551 --> 00:04:37,770
She plans to divorce out for a long time.

159
00:04:37,771 --> 00:04:42,771
It was incredibly calculating and the
idea that men don't deserve rights and

160
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,720
because of the fact that
women have been marginalized,

161
00:04:45,721 --> 00:04:46,380
which is true,

162
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,213
they have been,

163
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,200
but that doesn't mean that
men haven't been either.

164
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:49,561
I mean,

165
00:04:49,561 --> 00:04:52,680
human beings deserve to be treated fairly.

166
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,480
That's just true to you.

167
00:04:54,481 --> 00:04:55,290
You deserve,

168
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:57,060
everyone deserves to be treated humanely.

169
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,560
I don't believe men are,

170
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,910
I don't believe women are,

171
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,560
I don't believe humans are.

172
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,470
But the idea that you could
separate and be a feminist,

173
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,300
but the anti men's rights,

174
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:06,601
well,

175
00:05:06,601 --> 00:05:08,340
you're a fucking crazy person then.

176
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:08,791
You know,

177
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,140
you're not a humanist.

178
00:05:10,141 --> 00:05:13,020
You're not a person who's looking at
all human beings as your brothers and

179
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:13,854
sisters.

180
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,330
You're a person with that agenda.

181
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,850
You're a a person with an ideology.

182
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:19,620
And that ideology is
that you're on a team,

183
00:05:19,621 --> 00:05:21,990
you're on team vagina and
everything that's on TV.

184
00:05:21,991 --> 00:05:23,160
Penis can go fuck itself.

185
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,061
And that was the,

186
00:05:24,061 --> 00:05:24,531
that was the,

187
00:05:24,531 --> 00:05:25,470
the feedback.

188
00:05:25,471 --> 00:05:29,460
The blow back that I got for
a joke about male feminists.

189
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:30,011
Yeah.

190
00:05:30,011 --> 00:05:30,161
No,

191
00:05:30,161 --> 00:05:33,220
I mean I've stepped on that landmine a
couple of times and I keep going back to

192
00:05:33,221 --> 00:05:33,820
it cause it is,

193
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:34,870
it is an important one.

194
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:36,490
A young man in the legal system.

195
00:05:36,491 --> 00:05:39,550
I mean not just with divorce but I mean
the sentencing disparities between men

196
00:05:39,551 --> 00:05:39,851
and women,

197
00:05:39,851 --> 00:05:40,980
what they call the Pussy Bass,

198
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:41,630
you know,

199
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:42,031
I mean it's,

200
00:05:42,031 --> 00:05:42,641
it's horrendous.

201
00:05:42,641 --> 00:05:46,450
I mean you call Feminism
Marxists with Penny's socialism,

202
00:05:46,451 --> 00:05:46,961
socialism,

203
00:05:46,961 --> 00:05:47,531
the original prop,

204
00:05:47,531 --> 00:05:48,610
the socialism with tests.

205
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,730
But that was a bad character
and one of my novels,

206
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,410
but I just call it the feminism.

207
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,710
Socialism is Panisse and it's
very true because I mean,

208
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:57,710
and then people call,

209
00:05:57,711 --> 00:05:58,191
oh my God,

210
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:58,791
that's so terrible.

211
00:05:58,791 --> 00:05:59,090
Design.

212
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:02,390
I just went through all the founding
matriarchs of the feminist system that all

213
00:06:02,391 --> 00:06:02,931
Marxists,

214
00:06:02,931 --> 00:06:04,310
all leftist and so on.

215
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:07,100
And also if feminism is so pro woman,

216
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,680
then where are they
with Margaret Thatcher?

217
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:12,920
Margaret Thatcher was like the
first leader of a Western country.

218
00:06:12,921 --> 00:06:14,420
She struggled that from nothing.

219
00:06:14,421 --> 00:06:16,040
I made an incredibly powerful woman,

220
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,150
but she was on the right,

221
00:06:17,151 --> 00:06:17,451
you see,

222
00:06:17,451 --> 00:06:18,290
so they hate her.

223
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,400
What about Iran?

224
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:19,850
I ran,

225
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:20,210
wrote,

226
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:24,410
wrote the most influential book
outside the Bible and the second most

227
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:28,670
influential book in according to The
New York Times review of books after the

228
00:06:28,671 --> 00:06:29,330
Bible,

229
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:29,540
uh,

230
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:29,781
you know,

231
00:06:29,781 --> 00:06:34,310
reshaped a western philosophy in many
ways and western politics and the feminist

232
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:34,551
hater.

233
00:06:34,551 --> 00:06:34,761
Why?

234
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:36,190
Cause she was on the right cause he's,

235
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:36,861
that's what they think.

236
00:06:36,861 --> 00:06:40,730
She was not actually on the right but so
I mean I have these sort of suspicions

237
00:06:40,731 --> 00:06:42,070
when they're sort of the,

238
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,810
is it the leftist
ideology or the pro woman?

239
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:47,810
Now if it's the pro woman then
they should be incredibly positive.

240
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:52,100
Where are the feminists when people
insult people like and culture.

241
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,390
Where are the feminists when
people insult Sarah Palin,

242
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:55,311
you know,

243
00:06:55,311 --> 00:06:55,941
like Bill Maher,

244
00:06:55,941 --> 00:06:56,840
her called her a cunt.

245
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,360
I mean that's really pretty vicious.

246
00:06:59,361 --> 00:07:00,111
Like publicly,

247
00:07:00,111 --> 00:07:00,561
openly,

248
00:07:00,561 --> 00:07:00,831
right?

249
00:07:00,831 --> 00:07:04,700
I mean where are the fee because they're
on the right and culture are considered

250
00:07:04,701 --> 00:07:05,241
to be on the right.

251
00:07:05,241 --> 00:07:07,130
So they get a pass when people go,

252
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:07,431
you know,

253
00:07:07,431 --> 00:07:09,740
but you then say something
bad about a woman on the left.

254
00:07:09,741 --> 00:07:13,670
And so I think that it is more left
than it is pro women because when they

255
00:07:13,671 --> 00:07:15,920
choose between their
politics and the agenda,

256
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,260
they always seem to choose
the politics over the agenda.

257
00:07:18,261 --> 00:07:20,840
And that's why I say it's leftist
rather than than pro woman.

258
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:21,831
I agree.

259
00:07:21,831 --> 00:07:26,710
And I think there's a lot of really
emotional and non objective thinking

260
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,660
attached to feminism and there's a lot of,

261
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:30,430
there's a lot of really strange.

262
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:31,770
The,

263
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:31,951
the,

264
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:32,110
the,

265
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:35,590
one of the more recent ones that
I find incredibly strange is this,

266
00:07:35,591 --> 00:07:35,771
uh,

267
00:07:35,771 --> 00:07:40,090
there's this new trend of accusing men
of rape if they have sex with a woman

268
00:07:40,091 --> 00:07:41,050
who's had something to drink.

269
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:42,160
This is a,

270
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:42,400
uh,

271
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:42,820
like a,

272
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:46,630
a broad sweeping thing that's
going through the Internet.

273
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:47,730
And a lot of these,

274
00:07:47,731 --> 00:07:48,520
uh,

275
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,440
it's really weird because it seems to be,

276
00:07:50,441 --> 00:07:51,350
there's a lot of it in this,

277
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,200
what they call a skeptical community.

278
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,440
And I,

279
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:58,480
the skeptical community seems to be
of like integrated with a lot of male

280
00:07:58,481 --> 00:08:03,010
feminists and feminist
and this is something that
they've adopted this idea that

281
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,680
somehow or another
skepticism and this idea,

282
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,220
uh,

283
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:06,571
that they,

284
00:08:06,571 --> 00:08:07,420
that they combine.

285
00:08:07,421 --> 00:08:08,680
And it's,

286
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:10,630
I don't know if you're
aware of of the case,

287
00:08:10,631 --> 00:08:11,680
the Michael Shermer thing,

288
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,000
you know about all that accused,

289
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:13,630
uh,

290
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:15,370
some significant sexual impropriety,

291
00:08:15,371 --> 00:08:15,560
right?

292
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,090
Yeah.

293
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:21,090
No evidence other than a person who
doesn't want to reveal their name.

294
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:21,460
Yeah.

295
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:21,621
Who,

296
00:08:21,621 --> 00:08:21,970
he,

297
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:24,660
the guy who wrote the piece
heard about second hand.

298
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,000
Yeah.

299
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,890
He didn't even hear about
it directly from the person.

300
00:08:26,891 --> 00:08:28,440
And this is the person
who's supposed to spell it.

301
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:29,283
They not see,

302
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:30,390
I don't understand is,

303
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,290
and he is getting sued now,

304
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:35,620
but it's the idea of that
being the skeptic community.

305
00:08:35,621 --> 00:08:36,011
I mean,

306
00:08:36,011 --> 00:08:40,360
one of the things you learn as a skeptic
when you're breaking down any idea,

307
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:44,200
whether it's a religious idea
or whether it's an idea about,

308
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:44,450
uh,

309
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:49,450
an event that took place is that a
person's eye witness account of any

310
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,820
individual event is suspect.

311
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,280
And that it's one of the worst forms of,

312
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,383
of evidence.

313
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,290
And it doesn't mean that a terrible
thing didn't happen with this person,

314
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,390
but it does mean that if you look at the,

315
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:05,420
in the context of the way it was explained
in this guy's blog is that she was

316
00:09:05,581 --> 00:09:07,860
put in a position where
she couldn't consent.

317
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:09,091
Like what?

318
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:11,610
What kind of Weirdo language is that?

319
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,940
And then the,

320
00:09:12,941 --> 00:09:17,220
the corroborating evidence that he uses
in this blog is that a woman went to a

321
00:09:17,221 --> 00:09:22,221
party with this guy and he kept giving
her drinks and he was flirting and that

322
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,120
she got drunker than she usually does.

323
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,290
And that's it.

324
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:29,610
That's the corroborating piece of evidence
that the man and a woman who are both

325
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:32,640
adults were drinking
together and she got drunk.

326
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:33,503
I mean,

327
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,393
I,

328
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:39,030
you talk about removing yourself
a personal responsibility that he,

329
00:09:39,031 --> 00:09:42,060
this guy was responsible
for you getting drunker.

330
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,500
Like that's insane.

331
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:47,190
Like that's insane for a person
to say this and we'll be drinks.

332
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,590
What choice did I am feminist?

333
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:50,041
Like,

334
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:50,760
why would you,

335
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,090
how is it possible that a
person who believes in the,

336
00:09:54,091 --> 00:09:59,091
in the power of being a woman could think
that a woman is so much weaker than a

337
00:09:59,611 --> 00:10:00,270
man,

338
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:03,690
that she can't control how much liquor
she consumes when she's around a man?

339
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:07,740
If the man somehow or another like being
with her and drinking with her forces

340
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:09,630
her to consume more
than she normally would,

341
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:13,290
that's madness and there's
no excuse called I was drunk.

342
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:15,060
I mean try that with drunk driving,

343
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:15,450
right?

344
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:16,380
It's all points that,

345
00:10:16,381 --> 00:10:16,860
okay,

346
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:17,221
yes,

347
00:10:17,221 --> 00:10:19,020
you had diminished capacity
while you were driving,

348
00:10:19,021 --> 00:10:21,000
but you were responsible for
drinking and getting in the car.

349
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,080
It's the one time when we're willing to
alleviate someone of their own personal

350
00:10:25,081 --> 00:10:26,820
responsibility and only women.

351
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:31,870
A man is more a man who if a man and man
is more responsible if a man of women

352
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,910
or drunk together,

353
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:36,300
but the woman feels bad about
the encounter in the morning,

354
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:37,163
the man raped,

355
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:38,940
maybe all the man was drunk as well,

356
00:10:38,941 --> 00:10:42,000
but the men are always the aggressors
and always therefore guilty.

357
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,550
I mean that's not humanism,

358
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,570
but that has taken,

359
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:47,880
and this is a long dock road,

360
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:48,300
uh,

361
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,130
that as a man and you know,

362
00:10:50,131 --> 00:10:51,270
I'm sorry that if you're a woman,

363
00:10:51,271 --> 00:10:52,560
it's really hard to get this.

364
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:57,540
We have had so much negativity
over the past 40 or so years,

365
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:00,060
pearls and masculinity that,

366
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:00,421
I mean,

367
00:11:00,421 --> 00:11:02,280
we were like half criminals
just for breathing.

368
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:02,821
I mean,

369
00:11:02,821 --> 00:11:03,531
if you look at the,

370
00:11:03,531 --> 00:11:04,830
the role models on TV,

371
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,220
how,

372
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,370
how men to portray,

373
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:06,601
you know,

374
00:11:06,601 --> 00:11:08,700
the homeless Simpsons
and the American Dads,

375
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:15,020
they deck would all just idiots and sex
trace and irresponsible and stupid at

376
00:11:15,721 --> 00:11:19,920
the amazing thing is that it's true that
if you look at the belcove intelligence

377
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:20,850
for women,

378
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:25,200
it's kind of spikes in the middle of so
many more women are average intelligence

379
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,063
than men.

380
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:27,570
Now you still have your brilliant women,

381
00:11:27,571 --> 00:11:28,510
you still have your done with it.

382
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:31,410
But if you look at the bell curve of
male intelligence is much flatter,

383
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:34,890
which means that we have a lot more
geniuses and allot my complete idiots,

384
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:35,611
right?

385
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:38,520
And what's happening is everybody's
focused on the idiots among them.

386
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:42,420
And if completely began to ignore all
the brilliance that men bring to the

387
00:11:42,421 --> 00:11:42,720
world,

388
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,501
all of the amazing,

389
00:11:43,501 --> 00:11:45,570
incredible inventions that
men bring to the world.

390
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:47,550
And it's just with focusing
on this low cluster,

391
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,260
which is incredibly biased.

392
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,071
It's like saying,

393
00:11:50,071 --> 00:11:50,341
okay,

394
00:11:50,341 --> 00:11:51,270
well blacks in America,

395
00:11:51,271 --> 00:11:54,100
they commit more crimes and we're just
gonna focus on that and say that's

396
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:54,801
all the blacks are.

397
00:11:54,801 --> 00:11:56,170
That's all we're going
to portray as blacks,

398
00:11:56,171 --> 00:11:56,861
as criminals and blah,

399
00:11:56,861 --> 00:11:56,951
blah,

400
00:11:56,951 --> 00:11:57,061
blah.

401
00:11:57,061 --> 00:11:58,330
That would be incredibly racist.

402
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:01,810
But the sexism of portraying men as
idiots because we happen to have more

403
00:12:01,811 --> 00:12:05,710
cluster as a gender on that side and
completely ignoring all of the incredible

404
00:12:05,711 --> 00:12:07,570
stuff that brilliant
men bring to the world.

405
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,240
It's incredibly sexist
and it's really hard for,

406
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,490
for for people to see.

407
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,550
I mean like the idea that the,

408
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:15,281
we were talking earlier,

409
00:12:15,281 --> 00:12:18,430
the idea that a woman can competently
raise children without a man around.

410
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,840
It's just taken for granted.

411
00:12:19,841 --> 00:12:20,260
Now,

412
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:23,770
it's absolutely not true
matter of essential to the
healthy raising of children,

413
00:12:23,771 --> 00:12:26,890
but the idea that we would
recognize that as a society,

414
00:12:26,891 --> 00:12:28,390
it's just we were just the disposable,

415
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:32,000
very unfortunate situation.

416
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,100
We're in in regards to feminism that uh,

417
00:12:34,101 --> 00:12:38,330
a lot of people are dealing with their
own personal experiences that they've had

418
00:12:38,331 --> 00:12:42,410
with a few asshole men in their lives
in regards to them not being sexually

419
00:12:42,411 --> 00:12:45,320
attractive or not fitting into
a certain social group or not.

420
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:49,640
And then they have somehow or another
extrapolated that that all men are pieces

421
00:12:49,641 --> 00:12:53,960
of shit and rapists or a massive amount
of need to be curved and laws need to be

422
00:12:53,961 --> 00:12:54,411
changed.

423
00:12:54,411 --> 00:12:57,380
And if you get drunk with a
girl and you have sex with her,

424
00:12:57,381 --> 00:12:58,190
you're a rapist.

425
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:58,710
Right?

426
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:03,650
And a lot of this is based on their
own negative interactions with men.

427
00:13:03,651 --> 00:13:08,030
And this stereotype of
feminism unfortunately is like,

428
00:13:08,031 --> 00:13:09,440
there's a meme online,

429
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:12,260
this is feminism and it's a woman who,

430
00:13:12,261 --> 00:13:12,560
uh,

431
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,101
has a,

432
00:13:13,101 --> 00:13:13,580
um,

433
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:13,941
the,

434
00:13:13,941 --> 00:13:14,190
uh,

435
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:14,740
uh,

436
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:15,250
of,

437
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:15,610
of,

438
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:19,670
of holding up a sign saying I'm a
feminist and she's fucking 300 pounds.

439
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:20,863
And you know,

440
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:21,770
and everyone's like,

441
00:13:21,771 --> 00:13:22,130
yeah,

442
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:22,940
that's feminism.

443
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:23,251
You know,

444
00:13:23,251 --> 00:13:23,750
like this is,

445
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:23,901
yeah,

446
00:13:23,901 --> 00:13:24,291
you're right,

447
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:26,060
it's a big fat are going
to go that no one's a fuck.

448
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,680
That's really unfortunate.

449
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:29,300
But the person,

450
00:13:29,301 --> 00:13:31,550
the type of person that is a large,

451
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:34,600
unattractive woman is
going to deal with and uh,

452
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:35,960
in measurably,

453
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:38,850
it's going to be so much harder for,

454
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:41,990
for her to find people who
are sexually attracted to her,

455
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,370
for her to find a healthy
relationships for her too.

456
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:45,860
If you,

457
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:50,420
it's an unfortunate reality in this
world is that if you are not sexually

458
00:13:50,421 --> 00:13:51,230
attractive,

459
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,460
you are not going to have,

460
00:13:52,461 --> 00:13:54,530
is easier to ride when it
comes to the opposite sex.

461
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,393
It's just a fact.

462
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:56,541
Well,

463
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:56,811
I mean,

464
00:13:56,811 --> 00:13:58,580
but sexually attractive and 300 pounds,

465
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,001
I mean,

466
00:13:59,001 --> 00:14:00,050
somebody who's 300 pounds,

467
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,810
he is for most people got
gotta be sexually unattractive.

468
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:05,720
But if they chose to
lose weight and exercise,

469
00:14:05,721 --> 00:14:06,770
that's sort of a different matter.

470
00:14:06,771 --> 00:14:08,810
And that's just kind of have
a basic human competence.

471
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,360
But one of the things that
I hadn't thought of it,

472
00:14:10,361 --> 00:14:11,194
like I grew up with a,

473
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:14,780
a single mom and we lived because
single moms are used to be broke,

474
00:14:14,781 --> 00:14:14,991
right?

475
00:14:14,991 --> 00:14:15,201
I mean,

476
00:14:15,201 --> 00:14:16,370
because it's a tough life.

477
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,260
And so when I grew up with a single mom,

478
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,000
everyone around me has
single moms as well.

479
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:20,490
You know,

480
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:25,490
what's interesting is that the kind of
man who float through single mom world,

481
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:28,040
they're not always the best kind of men,

482
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:28,551
right?

483
00:14:28,551 --> 00:14:29,301
They kind of trashy,

484
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:29,541
right?

485
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:33,260
Because like the really competent and
successful and intelligent men aren't

486
00:14:33,261 --> 00:14:35,810
trawling the girlfriend
farms at the single mom.

487
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:36,261
You know,

488
00:14:36,261 --> 00:14:37,360
they'll rent housing getups.

489
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,120
Right?

490
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:42,260
And so I think what happens is a lot of
these women have grown up in single mom

491
00:14:42,261 --> 00:14:42,931
households or,

492
00:14:42,931 --> 00:14:46,400
or in this sort of environment and see
who the men who floating through that,

493
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:47,690
they tend to kind of be losers.

494
00:14:47,691 --> 00:14:49,130
They tend to be pretty unstable.

495
00:14:49,131 --> 00:14:51,140
They tend to be kind of parasitical.

496
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:51,291
They,

497
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:51,830
you know,

498
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:52,820
they don't tend to be very,

499
00:14:52,821 --> 00:14:54,050
the very best specimens of,

500
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:55,070
of masculinity.

501
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,940
And so I think the
breakdown of the family,

502
00:14:56,941 --> 00:15:00,230
he has created an environment where a
lot of girls growing up don't have a

503
00:15:00,231 --> 00:15:01,850
positive male role model in their life.

504
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:04,310
And the kind of men that they
see floating through their moms,

505
00:15:04,311 --> 00:15:05,720
dads tend to be kind of trashy.

506
00:15:05,721 --> 00:15:06,171
So they're like,

507
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:06,291
well,

508
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:07,130
this is masculinity.

509
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:10,150
It's also very unfortunate that
in their criticism of masculinity,

510
00:15:10,151 --> 00:15:12,310
you've removed a lot of allies,

511
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:13,031
you know,

512
00:15:13,031 --> 00:15:15,640
but by blanket generalizations of men,

513
00:15:15,641 --> 00:15:20,350
you removed a lot of people like myself
who I can't support you on that even

514
00:15:20,351 --> 00:15:23,870
though I'm an entirely
approach human being and,

515
00:15:23,871 --> 00:15:25,240
and pro equality.

516
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:29,080
But when you make these
mass generalizations and
call someone a men's rights

517
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,090
advocate asshole like that,

518
00:15:31,091 --> 00:15:31,361
these,

519
00:15:31,361 --> 00:15:32,860
these are nonsense statements.

520
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:35,590
And it's unfortunate that
I guarantee you these,

521
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:37,300
and it's not saying that all feminists,

522
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:41,260
feminists or unattractive
or all feminists or uh,

523
00:15:41,261 --> 00:15:41,661
you know,

524
00:15:41,661 --> 00:15:41,830
uh,

525
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:42,081
not,

526
00:15:42,081 --> 00:15:42,400
not,

527
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,570
not sexually viable,

528
00:15:43,571 --> 00:15:46,780
but I guarantee you almost all of them,

529
00:15:46,781 --> 00:15:48,730
I've had a lot of negative
experiences with men.

530
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,100
And it doesn't mean that
all men are negative.

531
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:56,200
And it doesn't mean that there's not
people out there that you would assume

532
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:57,190
would be assholes,

533
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,570
are actually very nice people.

534
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,680
But you've got this,

535
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:00,820
this idea that's,

536
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:04,810
it's easier to define the world by these
rigid dimensions that you've sort of

537
00:16:04,811 --> 00:16:05,710
set up for yourself.

538
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,040
And when,

539
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:07,900
when I,

540
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:11,950
when I read things that are from
this feminist point of view,

541
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:15,070
there's so often aggressive
and it's so often,

542
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,670
and I get that there's a blowback.

543
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:17,681
I do get that.

544
00:16:17,681 --> 00:16:20,050
I get that they've
experienced marginalization.

545
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,420
They believed that,

546
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:21,610
you know,

547
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:26,610
society is set up to support rape culture
and all these strange ideas and that

548
00:16:26,621 --> 00:16:27,760
there's a blow back to it.

549
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,610
But I don't think that the
way it's being handled is,

550
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:31,773
I think it's,

551
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:32,950
I don't think it's objective.

552
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:36,310
I don't think it's irrational
and I don't think it's balanced.

553
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:36,851
And,

554
00:16:36,851 --> 00:16:37,150
uh,

555
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:37,690
I,

556
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:42,490
I find it really weird when
really intelligent people
attach themselves to these

557
00:16:42,491 --> 00:16:43,570
feminist ideas.

558
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,000
Yeah.

559
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,221
And,

560
00:16:45,221 --> 00:16:45,570
and,

561
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:46,560
but the problem is,

562
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:47,160
you know,

563
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,680
in Canada here I had a guy on my show,

564
00:16:49,681 --> 00:16:51,060
Greg can't bill Gehringer who wrote,

565
00:16:51,061 --> 00:16:51,510
um,

566
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:51,900
uh,

567
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:52,830
at the end of the family.

568
00:16:52,831 --> 00:16:53,664
And it was,

569
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,270
and he pointed out that there's
a revolution that occurs.

570
00:16:57,271 --> 00:16:59,160
I think that initially it's necessary.

571
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,270
And I think this is also
with blacks in America too.

572
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:03,690
There's a revolution that occurs
then is initially necessary,

573
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:07,830
but the whole point of a revolution
is to defend itself to end,

574
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:08,671
right?

575
00:17:08,671 --> 00:17:09,181
So yeah,

576
00:17:09,181 --> 00:17:10,710
I mean there was stuff
that needed to be done.

577
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,820
Obviously we've talked about the,

578
00:17:11,821 --> 00:17:15,330
certainly the blacks and the 60s and some
stuff with women's kind of different,

579
00:17:15,331 --> 00:17:15,541
right?

580
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:16,141
So cause women,

581
00:17:16,141 --> 00:17:17,700
there's always been this
women and children first,

582
00:17:17,701 --> 00:17:17,901
right?

583
00:17:17,901 --> 00:17:20,280
Like the vast majority of the
people who died on the titanic,

584
00:17:20,281 --> 00:17:22,890
we're men offering up
their lifeboats to women,

585
00:17:22,891 --> 00:17:23,100
right?

586
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,930
Because there has been a sort
of women and children first,

587
00:17:24,931 --> 00:17:26,190
and women have been kind of elevated.

588
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:29,180
There was no black people for
us in the south right there.

589
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:30,240
So it's a little bit different.

590
00:17:30,241 --> 00:17:31,260
But there was,

591
00:17:31,261 --> 00:17:31,561
I think,

592
00:17:31,561 --> 00:17:33,660
some push for quality
that needed to happen.

593
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:37,080
But then what happens is you get a lot
of people who get heavily invested in

594
00:17:37,081 --> 00:17:38,850
this course and they'd be,

595
00:17:38,851 --> 00:17:39,670
becomes their ego,

596
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:40,503
their identity,

597
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:40,801
right?

598
00:17:40,801 --> 00:17:41,940
Like I fight for black lives,

599
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:43,320
I fight for women's rights and so on.

600
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:47,610
But then what happens is society will
often listen and respond in a positive

601
00:17:47,611 --> 00:17:48,360
way,

602
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,330
and then what is that
course begins to diminish?

603
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,490
And people are like,

604
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:52,730
you know,

605
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:53,251
supporting,

606
00:17:53,251 --> 00:17:53,431
like,

607
00:17:53,431 --> 00:17:56,010
I'm not going to support
you the abolitionists course
because slavery is ended.

608
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,360
Like I'm just not going to do with it.

609
00:17:57,361 --> 00:17:57,721
It's over.

610
00:17:57,721 --> 00:17:57,901
Right?

611
00:17:57,901 --> 00:17:58,081
I mean,

612
00:17:58,081 --> 00:17:59,040
there may be other problems,

613
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:00,330
but that's not the problem.

614
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,130
Right?

615
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:03,150
Like I know to support a lot of,

616
00:18:03,151 --> 00:18:03,390
uh,

617
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:03,621
you know,

618
00:18:03,621 --> 00:18:03,900
let's,

619
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,570
let's deal with polio victims because
we've got this vaccine and we don't really

620
00:18:06,571 --> 00:18:07,590
have polio victims anymore.

621
00:18:07,591 --> 00:18:07,771
Right?

622
00:18:07,771 --> 00:18:10,410
So the whole point of
revolution is to defund itself,

623
00:18:10,411 --> 00:18:12,390
to end for people to
move on with their lives.

624
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:14,490
But what happens is when
you haven't government,

625
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:16,710
you get these voting blocks and you get,

626
00:18:16,711 --> 00:18:17,610
like in Canada,

627
00:18:17,611 --> 00:18:19,050
over the last 10 or 15 years,

628
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:22,230
Katie government's given $300
million to feminist groups.

629
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,470
That's not coming from Canadian women
or Canadian men for that matter,

630
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:26,150
because,

631
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:26,370
you know,

632
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:27,660
a lot of it's kind of been dealt with.

633
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:31,710
But these groups continue by by poking
these scams and by continuing these

634
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:35,340
grievances and by finding the Trayvon
Martin situation and blowing it up into a

635
00:18:35,341 --> 00:18:36,810
race war and all this kind of stuff.

636
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,580
A lot of the stuff has been dealt with,

637
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,070
but because the government's
still getting the money,

638
00:18:41,071 --> 00:18:44,220
they still need to whip up these kinds
of hysteria there just to justify their

639
00:18:44,221 --> 00:18:44,791
own existence.

640
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:45,270
I mean,

641
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:49,110
the whole point of a revolution is to end
the whole point of I want to deal with

642
00:18:49,111 --> 00:18:49,540
measles.

643
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,240
It's get a vaccine and end measles.

644
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,670
You don't keep taking the same
amount of money that year after year,

645
00:18:53,671 --> 00:18:54,960
but if you have a government funding it,

646
00:18:54,961 --> 00:18:56,640
then you have to manufacture
these grievances,

647
00:18:56,641 --> 00:18:58,440
which just keeps things
going and getting worse.

648
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,800
The point of revolution has a resolution
and resolution never seems to come

649
00:19:02,801 --> 00:19:03,060
play.

650
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:08,060
It's never going to take place if you're
approaches imbalanced and there's just

651
00:19:09,161 --> 00:19:14,161
some things that are being some proponents
of feminism or endorsing one of them

652
00:19:14,711 --> 00:19:17,350
being the ability to
withdraw consent equals rape.

653
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,450
The ability that you mean after the fact?

654
00:19:19,451 --> 00:19:19,720
Yeah,

655
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,351
after the fact.

656
00:19:20,351 --> 00:19:20,531
Yeah.

657
00:19:20,531 --> 00:19:22,770
That's sending you can send it to you.

658
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,890
That's like me giving you my coffee and
then judging you with theft when you

659
00:19:25,891 --> 00:19:26,700
walk out the room.

660
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:26,851
Yeah,

661
00:19:26,851 --> 00:19:27,684
take my coffee.

662
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:28,021
Oh,

663
00:19:28,021 --> 00:19:30,690
officer that he stole my coffee because
I changed my mind after the fact when he

664
00:19:30,691 --> 00:19:30,960
left.

665
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,141
Well,

666
00:19:31,141 --> 00:19:35,130
the idea is that a man can lie to a
woman in order to get in bed with her and

667
00:19:35,131 --> 00:19:37,190
then if she can prove that he did that,

668
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,380
but that he's a rapist because
he tricked her with his words.

669
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:40,651
Yeah,

670
00:19:40,651 --> 00:19:41,930
because of course women never lie.

671
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:42,331
I mean,

672
00:19:42,331 --> 00:19:43,170
they don't use makeup.

673
00:19:43,171 --> 00:19:44,550
They don't puff up their tits.

674
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:45,384
They don't ever

675
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,830
falsify any therapy.

676
00:19:46,831 --> 00:19:49,680
You don't do anything like a man because
he's wealthy and hope to get pregnant

677
00:19:49,681 --> 00:19:50,170
with him either.

678
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:50,480
I mean,

679
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,010
I don't see any feminists that
are decrying that and that's a,

680
00:19:53,011 --> 00:19:54,990
that's a horrible front to womanhood.

681
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,290
I think that the only way that you could
make a live in is to lie to a man and

682
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,460
make him get you pregnant so
that you can get money from them.

683
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:02,011
From then on.

684
00:20:02,011 --> 00:20:02,580
I mean,

685
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,530
we're feminist.

686
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,970
True feminists should
be horrified by that,

687
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:07,151
which I'll focus on.

688
00:20:07,151 --> 00:20:08,350
The false rape accusations,

689
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,330
false rape accusations,

690
00:20:10,331 --> 00:20:14,710
which in some studies or 2030 or
40% of the study in the air force,

691
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:15,641
but they actually do,

692
00:20:15,641 --> 00:20:17,920
even women who have
withdrawn their accusations,

693
00:20:17,921 --> 00:20:21,160
2030 or 40% of Rick Rick
accusations in some studies,

694
00:20:21,161 --> 00:20:23,790
who knows what it is
universally are our fast.

695
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,160
I mean how horrendous that and
women should be coming down so hard.

696
00:20:27,161 --> 00:20:30,280
I'm wondering who make
false rape accusations cause
they make it so much harder

697
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,720
for the women who actually happened,

698
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:31,991
right?

699
00:20:31,991 --> 00:20:34,180
Because then there's that
problem or a false paternity.

700
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:37,520
And the problem with fall three
prepositions are very few women fees face

701
00:20:37,521 --> 00:20:38,440
repercussions for them.

702
00:20:38,441 --> 00:20:38,611
No.

703
00:20:38,611 --> 00:20:39,610
Am I in my book?

704
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:40,630
If you can,

705
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:42,760
if you accuse someone
of a crime and you lied,

706
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:43,630
you get the punishment,

707
00:20:43,631 --> 00:20:44,410
they would have gotten,

708
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:45,650
you should

709
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:48,070
player football

710
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,540
player who has recently been released,

711
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:50,090
uh,

712
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:51,400
that he got on tape,

713
00:20:51,401 --> 00:20:56,200
this girl a admitting that she lied
about him being him raping her and her

714
00:20:56,201 --> 00:21:00,970
family received $1 million
or $850,000 and now they,

715
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:01,410
you know,

716
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:02,620
they have to pay the money back.

717
00:21:02,621 --> 00:21:04,060
But that's the extent of her punishment.

718
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,100
This guy went to jail
for five fucking years,

719
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:06,761
you know,

720
00:21:06,761 --> 00:21:11,140
and now he's just trying to re pursue
recording and he'd still be there.

721
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:11,321
Well,

722
00:21:11,321 --> 00:21:11,891
not only that,

723
00:21:11,891 --> 00:21:13,150
he's just one of many.

724
00:21:13,151 --> 00:21:15,850
I have three friends that
were falsely accused of rape.

725
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:17,710
I also have friends that were raped.

726
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:18,940
I know that there's,

727
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,960
I know rape is real.

728
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:20,590
You know,

729
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:22,810
I have friends that have
been roofing and you know,

730
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,480
got out of danger because
someone recognized in been drug.

731
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:25,840
It's not,

732
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,860
it's very common.

733
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:27,371
You know,

734
00:21:27,371 --> 00:21:28,810
rape is a disgusting,

735
00:21:28,811 --> 00:21:31,330
horrible anti human crime.

736
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,341
And I,

737
00:21:32,341 --> 00:21:33,161
I think rape is,

738
00:21:33,161 --> 00:21:34,810
should be treated the
same way as murderers.

739
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:35,290
You're,

740
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:37,030
you're denying someone their humanity.

741
00:21:37,031 --> 00:21:37,481
You're doing,

742
00:21:37,481 --> 00:21:39,190
you're taking away something,

743
00:21:39,191 --> 00:21:40,120
some part of them,

744
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:43,750
you're removing a part of the
w the who they are as a person.

745
00:21:43,751 --> 00:21:44,584
It's kind of permanent.

746
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:44,890
Yeah.

747
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:46,840
Somebody you can get a new car,

748
00:21:46,841 --> 00:21:49,780
but there's something about sexual
violations that it's kind of a permanent

749
00:21:49,781 --> 00:21:49,891
thing.

750
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:50,724
It's horrible,

751
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:53,020
but so is lying about it.

752
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,730
That's horrible to lying about.

753
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:56,110
A rape is just as hard a lot of it,

754
00:21:56,111 --> 00:21:56,861
but often we get them in,

755
00:21:56,861 --> 00:21:57,430
right?

756
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:58,240
Yes,

757
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:58,631
yes.

758
00:21:58,631 --> 00:22:03,040
And this idea of this idea
of withdrawing consent,

759
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:03,851
you know,

760
00:22:03,851 --> 00:22:06,700
and it's somehow or another you could
do that and turn a guy into a rapist

761
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,100
that's like hating thing that's uh,

762
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:09,650
you don't,

763
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:09,900
you,

764
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:10,241
you,

765
00:22:10,241 --> 00:22:10,530
you,

766
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:11,560
what you're doing is you're,

767
00:22:11,561 --> 00:22:11,891
you're,

768
00:22:11,891 --> 00:22:12,191
you're,

769
00:22:12,191 --> 00:22:14,230
you're hating someone who's manipulative.

770
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:17,290
You're hating someone
who can con you into bed.

771
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:22,470
But that's been what men have been
trying to do since the beginning of time.

772
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,990
Like you're eating of the
game of courting a woman.

773
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:30,280
And there have been men that wear shoes
that they would never wear watches me,

774
00:22:30,281 --> 00:22:31,120
would never buy.

775
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:31,811
And cars.

776
00:22:31,811 --> 00:22:35,590
They don't give a shit about an apartment
that they decorate just to get the

777
00:22:35,591 --> 00:22:37,300
woman to believe that they're like this.

778
00:22:37,301 --> 00:22:38,460
It's all a alive.

779
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:39,730
My friend Brian,

780
00:22:39,731 --> 00:22:40,750
we saw earlier tonight,

781
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,120
last night for sure.

782
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:42,880
Um,

783
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,720
Brian Callan,

784
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,070
so hilarious guy the first time,

785
00:22:45,071 --> 00:22:46,780
if you over his house
back when he was single,

786
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:49,420
he had Jack Kerouac on the road,

787
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:49,901
uh,

788
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:52,080
sitting on his night table open.

789
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,593
Anthony,

790
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:56,231
I'm a predator.

791
00:22:56,231 --> 00:22:57,300
So I come over his house and like,

792
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,510
then she may have written that,

793
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:58,841
you know,

794
00:22:58,841 --> 00:22:59,161
I,

795
00:22:59,161 --> 00:23:01,240
I find weaknesses and people very quickly.

796
00:23:01,241 --> 00:23:01,841
So I saw that.

797
00:23:01,841 --> 00:23:02,320
I go,

798
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,430
you're not fucking reading that.

799
00:23:03,431 --> 00:23:03,611
I go,

800
00:23:03,611 --> 00:23:03,931
you're,

801
00:23:03,931 --> 00:23:05,560
you're hoping a chick comes over.

802
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,090
And she sees that and she's like,

803
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:07,411
Oh,

804
00:23:07,411 --> 00:23:10,150
you read so much at polling
are amazed that he's there.

805
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,140
He started laughing.

806
00:23:11,141 --> 00:23:11,381
He goes,

807
00:23:11,381 --> 00:23:12,400
it's true.

808
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,331
It's true.

809
00:23:13,331 --> 00:23:15,850
I decorate my house to
pretend I'm smarter than I am.

810
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:16,421
I did that.

811
00:23:16,421 --> 00:23:18,010
There was a Stephen Hawking's book,

812
00:23:18,011 --> 00:23:19,600
a brief history of time
or by the upper right.

813
00:23:19,601 --> 00:23:21,490
And I had that on my end.

814
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:22,001
This woman,

815
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:22,960
I loved her to death.

816
00:23:22,961 --> 00:23:23,681
We went out for a while.

817
00:23:23,681 --> 00:23:24,970
This woman came over and she's like,

818
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,133
I call bullshit.

819
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:29,590
I call bullshit on stuff later,

820
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:30,260
and I'm like,

821
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:30,431
