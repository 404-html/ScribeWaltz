1
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:05,080
Yo,

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:06,700
what

3
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:15,460
the Joe Rogan experience podcast is 
brought to you by the fleshlight bought 

4
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,810
to you by several things were brought to
you for you guys.

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,310
This is the most important part.

6
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:22,400
Were brought together the whole thing.
It's all for you.

7
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:27,700
It's all for you,
but we've got to pay bills than with 

8
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:27,700
cost money.
What's that?

9
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,200
Dramatic opening by the way?
You had this fucking too high to talk.

10
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:34,700
How to wait a few seconds and wait for 
the moment to achieve me.

11
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:40,150
We did the music after the commercials,
so it's easy to edit if somebody wants 

12
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:41,030
to.
Nobody wants to listen.

13
00:00:41,031 --> 00:00:43,030
These goddamn commercials I'd have to 
do.

14
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:44,300
I'm back.
Joe.

15
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:49,360
I've returned.
What was the last time you used your 

16
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:49,360
flashlight?
A.

17
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:49,580
Actually,
I use it all weekend because my girl was

18
00:00:49,581 --> 00:00:54,581
at avn was really hard because every hot
girl was outside of Los Angeles and went

19
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:56,750
to Vegas.
It seemed like.

20
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:02,050
No.
So you had a hard time masturbating 

21
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:02,050
pretending on hot girls in town.
Right?

22
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,460
What a fucking twisted world you live 
in.

23
00:01:04,461 --> 00:01:05,420
Where you think that all went.

24
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:07,130
All the porn stars are out of town.
Well,

25
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:10,070
no more attractive now.
There's like an energy in the air,

26
00:01:10,071 --> 00:01:11,810
you know,
and if it leaves,

27
00:01:11,811 --> 00:01:14,000
it's like a ghost town.
It feels really empty inside.

28
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:18,260
Your world is inexorably tied to the 
porn world at this point.

29
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,500
That's why.
Yeah,

30
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:20,560
it's weird.
Yeah,

31
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:22,350
it's very strange.
You live a strange life,

32
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:23,870
my friend.
Yeah.

33
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,210
So you had to like beat it all weekend.
Yeah,

34
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:27,410
I did.
I went crazy.

35
00:01:27,411 --> 00:01:28,520
I went ape shit.
Nice.

36
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:30,380
It's a solid product.
That flashlight.

37
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,180
It's a.
I'll tell you what,

38
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,330
just just for sheer impact of 
effectiveness,

39
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:37,880
efficacy is better than anything we 
promote.

40
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:40,240
It's better than any of the vitamins.
It's better than anything,

41
00:01:40,241 --> 00:01:45,241
but it's nice to have mental clarity.
But to really be able to shoot fucking 

42
00:01:45,241 --> 00:01:46,880
blasto loads like,
like you can with a flashlight.

43
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,580
Have you seen that thing that they may.

44
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,550
One of our,
uh,

45
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:54,580
rants on past podcasts where it's an 
ipad holder that you can kind of attach 

46
00:01:55,100 --> 00:02:00,100
a fleshlight yeah.
And so now you can sit there and they 

47
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,410
had this porn,
like first person shooter type form that

48
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,760
you sit there and watch on your ipad 
while it.

49
00:02:04,761 --> 00:02:06,800
And holding it while it's connected to 
your flashlight.

50
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:10,400
It's just the beginning.
Just the beginning.

51
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:15,460
It's once it goes virtual,
that's when things are going to be 

52
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:15,460
really strange when there's somehow or 
another,

53
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:19,730
like the put a helmet on you and then 
the fleshlight moves up and down your 

54
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:21,020
Dick.
And probably like a bunch of flashlights

55
00:02:21,021 --> 00:02:24,280
all over your body by doing right.
Joey,

56
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,030
Joey,
Joey,

57
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,050
Joey.

58
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,510
Anyway,
the flashlights should be.

59
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,770
You should be able to take the Alpha 
brains and fuck the fleshlight.

60
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,080
You shouldn't combine.
That's,

61
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:39,850
that's the secret right there.
Yeah.

62
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:44,180
Chemists to be too smart while you're 
fucking of fake pussy.

63
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:47,270
Better off.
Like we have like Alpha dumb pills,

64
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:52,460
mushrooms,
psychedelic trip as you fucking coming.

65
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,610
So let's say you fucked a purple one.
You'd think of purple things.

66
00:02:55,670 --> 00:03:00,670
I don't know.
I would like to know what my Iq is when 

67
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:00,670
I have a hard on because I bet it's 
half.

68
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:05,490
Yeah.
I would like to know what my Iq is when 

69
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:05,490
I have a book in three thinking nothing 
else.

70
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:06,430
It's amazing.
You know,

71
00:03:06,431 --> 00:03:07,540
women realize that,
you know,

72
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:11,200
when they realized that when they try to
become men like Chaz Bono,

73
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:11,920
you know,
she's,

74
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:16,370
one of the things she's saying is like 
now she understands like male behavior.

75
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:17,950
She does it.
She understands it.

76
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,230
She understands she was,
she understands.

77
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:23,680
Yes.
She's been a man.

78
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,560
Go get your two year old and say she's 
all fucking fat with that fucking bitch.

79
00:03:31,581 --> 00:03:33,170
You don't trick me.
You don't like that beard.

80
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:37,370
I just don't listen to people want to 
have parties for a little while.

81
00:03:37,371 --> 00:03:40,550
She's going into a deep water here.
She made the conversion.

82
00:03:40,551 --> 00:03:45,551
She went right beep into being a fucking
man because you strap a pair on and 

83
00:03:45,551 --> 00:03:46,340
don't.
Like I said today,

84
00:03:46,341 --> 00:03:51,341
you can't fucking to just drop a pair 
and nuggets on and go out there and 

85
00:03:51,341 --> 00:03:53,990
sling.
I always fucking know that you're the 

86
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:53,990
real deal.
You know who you kidding?

87
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:56,150
You Been Sucking Dick for 20 years.
Now you want to change.

88
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:01,170
Fucking governments can't do that shit.
You can change government changing 

89
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,770
government.
It's two different.

90
00:04:03,771 --> 00:04:05,540
Fucking world's man,
a fucking woman.

91
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:06,330
I.
You know what ma'am?

92
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:09,490
Wouldn't you hate to have been born?
What if you imagined you were man,

93
00:04:09,491 --> 00:04:14,491
but you were really a woman.
You really wish you were a woman like 

94
00:04:14,491 --> 00:04:14,491
that would fucking be so frustrating.

95
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:15,920
Gotcha it.

96
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,380
Well,
what is it then?

97
00:04:20,381 --> 00:04:21,900

We're going to talk about that.

102
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,870
We're going to talk about that right

I liked it.
I've never used the flashlight,

113
00:04:57,751 --> 00:04:59,420
but what I like about it right now,
thinking about it,

114
00:04:59,421 --> 00:05:01,370
at least you know what you're fucking 
tropical helmet.

115

Juices going sometimes when you open

you don't know what the fuck.
Yeah.

117
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:10,190
Look,
sometimes you find on your foot in the 

118
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,620
flashlight,
it goes right to the bottom,

119
00:05:13,621 --> 00:05:16,770
like Hershey's chocolate.
Goes back to the step mother fucked up.

120
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,900
And you're backpage.
That's right.

121

00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:28,960
I mean,
who is it?

125
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:32,240
Who's that in the back?
Oh,

126
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,520
what?
I don't know.

127
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,180
All right.
So anyways,

128
00:05:37,181 --> 00:05:37,960

over here.

130
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,150
Um,
sounded like me.

131
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,640
You're watching videos of me talking to 
my dog.

132
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,020
Fuck.
It.

133
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,020
Sounded like.
Hey twix ice or something like that.

134
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:53,970
Wow,
that's creepy.

135
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:58,310
Just kidding.

136
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:00,520
What is it to your computer?
No,

137
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,080
somebody's computer was making all that 
noise.

138
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:07,280
My computer was not on holidays or off.
What the fuck happened?

139
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:12,610
We'll let start this motherfucker.
Joe Rogan is Alpha brain would help us 

140
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:16,700
solve this conundrum of where the fuck 
the sound came from and what it was that

141
00:06:16,701 --> 00:06:17,600
had to be your shit.
Dude,

142
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,070
no it wasn't.
It couldn't have been mine.

143
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,980
There was nothing on mine when I went 
back there.

144
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:21,790
Is there,
right?

145
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,440
If you'd like to look at videos to get 
it.

146
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:30,690
I am on Alpha brain.
You cannot sneak by me with your 

147
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:31,610
childish games.
They don't work.

148
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,200
I see him.
I see the plan.

149
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:38,410
I see the matrix.
What's fucking dylan?

150
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:41,300
How dare you?
I think we've got Brian A.

151
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,350
Little too high.
I don't think.

152
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,110
I don't think he can do it.
Okay.

153
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:48,480
It was a beeper,

Did you mention my olive garden?

206
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:16,740
You know,
it kind of sucks about that whole thing 

207
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,531
that everyone now takes pictures while 
they're at the olive garden and sends 

208
00:09:18,531 --> 00:09:21,501
them to me.
So I get so tired of looking at olive 

209
00:09:21,501 --> 00:09:23,991
garden like that is not like.
Honestly I don't give a shit about the 

210
00:09:23,991 --> 00:09:26,300
olive garden even though people fled my 
twit stream with all of you.

See Two old people and I got to thank 
Grillo's pickles too.

215
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:38,810
Remember we were talking about that.
A pickle company in Boston that had 

216
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:39,720
these homemade pickles and we're selling
them in the park and I'll fucking.

217
00:09:39,721 --> 00:09:44,721
Awesome.
Now they got ahold of me and they sent 

218
00:09:44,721 --> 00:09:44,721
me some.
Oh you fucking.

219
00:09:44,721 --> 00:09:48,530
Oh my God.
He's a fucking pickles are ridiculous 

220
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:49,980
dude.
They have these hot Habanero pickles,

221
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,970
pickles with like slices of Jalapeno and
Habanero in it.

222
00:09:53,971 --> 00:09:56,340
They're like really spicy pickles.
Damn.

223
00:09:56,341 --> 00:10:01,341
They're good.
Feel like fresh and just crispin woo 

224
00:10:01,341 --> 00:10:05,020
sliced cheese burger.
Tremendous fucking serious pickles.

225
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:10,310
I know.
It seems like I'm excited about talking 

226
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:10,310
about Chaz.

227
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,070
Chaz Bono.
That's what is,

228
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:15,840
you know,
was crazy by Chaz Bono.

229
00:10:15,841 --> 00:10:18,240
She's got to look like Ralphie May.
Once she had the surgery,

230
00:10:18,241 --> 00:10:20,920
was like fuck,
I mean Chaz Bono is that,

231
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:25,970
that is the most amusing story to me of 
last year and I don't fuck with it 

232
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:26,340
really.
I just don't fuck with it.

233
00:10:26,341 --> 00:10:31,341
It's just the,
it's just creeps me to fuck out one way 

234
00:10:31,341 --> 00:10:33,711
or the other.
I don't know why I feel really bad for 

235
00:10:33,711 --> 00:10:33,711
you.
No,

236
00:10:33,711 --> 00:10:34,680
I uh,
I just feel like if you,

237
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:37,710
if you're going to go through with that 
for I feel bad for one way or the other,

238
00:10:37,711 --> 00:10:42,711
either I feel bad for her because she 
really is a man trapped in a woman's 

239
00:10:42,711 --> 00:10:44,760
body and that must be really frustrating
or I feel bad for that.

240
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:45,810
She's,
you know,

241
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:50,840
she's in this state of disarray where 
that's the option and you've got to go 

242
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:55,041
through surgery and it just seems to me 
like anybody that would need to do that 

243
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:59,661
for any reason just to actually change 
and try to become something else and 

244
00:10:59,661 --> 00:11:01,200
become some different sex,
you know,

245
00:11:01,201 --> 00:11:01,860
that's,
that's a,

246
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:07,260
that's a deep dissatisfaction with your 
current life and you know,

247
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:12,390
who's to say that maybe her solution 
isn't becoming a man to play rugby first

248
00:11:12,391 --> 00:11:13,080
and then come back.

249
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:18,080
You know what I'm saying?
I like to know she's happier now mean 

250
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,340
that there'll be an interesting call.
I knew I knew a comedian in Seattle that

251
00:11:20,341 --> 00:11:23,130
was a man and became a woman.
Had the surgery,

252
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,890
the whole psychological one through the 
whole thing.

253
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,820
And uh,
it was hard on her.

254
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,930
Her name was Rita.
Oh,

255
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:34,160
her head was fucking huge.
Time to time.

256
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:37,560
That's how she died.
She fucked up.

257
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,660
God was too big.
She was at a club.

258
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:42,800
She fucking went down like a boxer named
Rita.

259
00:11:42,801 --> 00:11:43,290
Oh,
well,

260
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:45,210
you know what happened to.
He's in a white,

261
00:11:45,211 --> 00:11:46,710
I think Seattle.
I'm not joking.

262
00:11:46,711 --> 00:11:48,270
I wish I was,
but I'm not joking.

263
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,490
She used to,
we used to stay at brody,

264
00:11:50,491 --> 00:11:55,491
Stevens and me used to steal her Nachos 
at open mic and she had a womanly voice 

265
00:11:55,491 --> 00:11:58,570
and when we were still on Nachos she'd 
say pour them the fuck down.

266
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,970
We would just stop.
I robbed the bank.

267
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,630
100 values from her and she put a gun to
my head.

268
00:12:04,631 --> 00:12:08,050
This bitch,
she was five foot two and she died maybe

269
00:12:08,051 --> 00:12:10,550
two years after I moved out of Seattle 
as brody when,

270
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:15,630
when she got she got the full operation.
You've got to get the full moon when 

271
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:15,630
they,
when you do that,

272
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:19,360
your body really like shrinks up their 
mass.

273
00:12:19,361 --> 00:12:21,490
Right.
And maybe maybe you really,

274
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:26,491
if you have a big head and maybe it will
work as long as you have a big body to 

275
00:12:26,491 --> 00:12:30,181
go with it,
but if you have a big hand a little bit 

276
00:12:30,181 --> 00:12:32,971
like that,
like dad actually does make sense that 

277
00:12:32,971 --> 00:12:35,821
she would be like,
she was often because your muscles go 

278
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:36,810
away with the size of your head is like.
And her drug problem was,

279
00:12:36,811 --> 00:12:38,890
uh,
it was just horrendous.

280
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,230
The drug problem that she had from the 
pain,

281
00:12:41,231 --> 00:12:43,750
like and one night from the pain of the 
surgery,

282
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:44,980
like know the pain of.

283
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:50,030
She just drank every night.
She didn't leave the house without a 

284
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:50,350
bottle in her purse.
I mean,

285
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,660
Geez,
one night we did an open mic and the guy

286
00:12:52,661 --> 00:12:57,661
threw her out of Arab throughout.
She went home and we talked to her into 

287
00:12:57,661 --> 00:12:59,200
calling the White House.
It was the cocaine we played.

288
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,660
You got to call the White House.
Do you remember that dude?

289
00:13:01,661 --> 00:13:03,400
He used to come around.
The comedy store's Kinda.

290
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:07,600
It was Kinda half homeless,
half crossdresser type character.

291
00:13:07,601 --> 00:13:09,790
The black guy was his name.
Boom.

292
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:14,830
Shaka Laka my ship from my girlfriend 
from that guy like faces and shoes and a

293
00:13:17,981 --> 00:13:18,770
half a hooker.

294
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:27,260
I love bikes with a fucking.
He's had some nutty moments,

295
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:33,541
man.
One time when he was in the back of the 

296
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:33,541
comedy store and he was like yelling at 
no one in particular,

297
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:38,040
fuck this motherfucker like really mad 
at somebody and he went and stormed into

298
00:13:38,231 --> 00:13:43,231
the little bathroom there was washing up
in the air and they were trying to get 

299
00:13:43,231 --> 00:13:46,921
rid of them.
They're trying to calm her down and get 

300
00:13:46,921 --> 00:13:46,921
him off the porch.
I don't know exactly what happened,

301
00:13:46,921 --> 00:13:46,921
but I was like,
wow,

302
00:13:46,921 --> 00:13:49,060
this dude's fucking mad.
Some shit's about to go down.

303
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:52,900
Well they would tease him on Sunday 
nights and torture him and then he would

304
00:13:52,901 --> 00:13:56,110
go fucking awol black on you.
Fuck this motherfucker.

305
00:13:56,111 --> 00:13:58,600
I'll kill you and all this shit.
There's something that happened with him

306
00:13:58,601 --> 00:14:01,980
and Dan by Bilac Bilac.
But yeah,

307
00:14:01,981 --> 00:14:03,310
it's something happy between those 
tickets.

308
00:14:03,311 --> 00:14:06,910
He always carries around signs and 
things like going against him.

309
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:10,310
So I think or maybe it's vice versa.
I don't know.

310
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:15,370
You don't know what the story is,
but I'll talk about that tonight at 

311
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:16,560
another park,
Bro.

312
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:20,880
Be the Friday night meeting you and 
Duncan trussell.

313
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,530
Let me tell say I've been excited about 
going to Chicago.

314
00:14:23,531 --> 00:14:26,200
Chicago is one of those cities that you 
know nothing.

315
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,640
It's always like you never really think 
about you.

316
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,670
You're on your way there.
Then you get excited.

317
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,820
You get really fucking excited.
We're going down to the city,

318
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,700
great fights.
You know the great Italian food,

319
00:14:36,701 --> 00:14:41,110
great Polish food does everything that 
everything per roghey's stakes.

320
00:14:41,111 --> 00:14:42,790
We're in the Midwest and one other 
thing.

321
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:48,120
You better dress warm motherfucker.
It's called the cops that arrested Tony 

322
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,050
Montana at time for fucking money.
Laundry.

323
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,160
Mom,
you said you'd been addressed?

324
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:53,490
Warm is going to be fucking cold.
Will go on in the,

325
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:58,730
in the nucleus of the winter,
the last week of January that the 

326
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,360
fucking storm says the [inaudible] days 
and cold and you have a winter jacket.

327
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,530
Fuck yeah,
I do.

328
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:10,060
You can have one of my man.
I have boxes of them.

329
00:15:10,061 --> 00:15:13,610
I've got an awesome fucking believable 
that will go on into the wind,

330
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:16,670
will go into the eye of the storm.
So awesome.

331
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,270
And I don't give a fuck.
I'm redheaded child son and base being,

332
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:23,330
oh my gosh,
I'm Chael Sonnen and bisping is going to

333
00:15:23,331 --> 00:15:28,331
be fucking crazy.
I just wished that fight could take 

334
00:15:28,331 --> 00:15:29,870
place a couple months from now instead 
of like this weekend.

335
00:15:29,871 --> 00:15:32,390
So I want to hear more trash talking 
from these guys.

336
00:15:32,391 --> 00:15:33,930
I want to hear more.
Not even try.

337
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,630
I mean they're not even trash talk and 
like,

338
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:38,330
you know,
bisping is confident as fuck man,

339
00:15:38,331 --> 00:15:43,331
this is going to be real interesting.
I think on the people sleep on this 

340
00:15:43,331 --> 00:15:44,690
thing for some reason I don't sleep on 
those things.

341
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,400
He's a bad business and it's going to be
a.

342
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:50,630
he's one of the fittest guys at one 85 
too.

343
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:52,170
He's very fit.
He's like,

344
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:56,320
he's a dedicated athlete and like he 
puts a pace on dudes mad,

345
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:01,750
you know,
a lot of sick people say made him look 

346
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,851
really bad.
And then in the last fight may have 

347
00:16:03,851 --> 00:16:03,851
definitely looked bad,
but one of the,

348
00:16:03,851 --> 00:16:07,370
part of the reason why he looked bad 
because Michael bisping look good.

349
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,590
He looks sharp,
man.

350
00:16:09,591 --> 00:16:12,770
His standup was sharp,
his conditioning sharpest.

351
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,040
Fucking his defense was sharp when the 
fight went to the ground,

352
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,300
everything was good man.
And he,

353
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:23,320
he put it on mayhem.
And you saw like an evolution of him 

354
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,740
over the last few years,
you know,

355
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:28,130
you,
you can see in the Jorge reverify,

356
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:31,310
see in this fight and the mayhem fight 
really in the mayhem fight,

357
00:16:31,311 --> 00:16:36,311
you really see it.
Like he's turned a serious fucking 

358
00:16:36,311 --> 00:16:36,311
corner.
You know Michael.

359
00:16:36,311 --> 00:16:40,810
But Michael Bisping's dangerous.
And you know what I loved about the 

360
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:42,941
fight after it was over,
he was upset at himself for the first 

361
00:16:42,941 --> 00:16:46,271
round,
even though he had this like flawless 

362
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:46,370
performance and virtually shut out 
mayhem,

363
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,440
you know,
until the fight got stopped.

364
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,600
Once he got up to his feet,
the second round started,

365
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:54,230
he just shut him down,
just completely shut him down.

366
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,660
And if you.
And if you see that you would think,

367
00:16:56,661 --> 00:16:58,910
well he should be happy,
but he wasn't happy.

368
00:16:58,911 --> 00:17:03,911
And one of the first things he said was 
that he was upset at his performance in 

369
00:17:03,911 --> 00:17:07,571
the first round.
Wasn't going to do if you ever fought 

370
00:17:07,571 --> 00:17:07,571
the champion.
Does the first thing you said.

371
00:17:07,571 --> 00:17:10,490
So there's a guy who's not even not even
congratulating them himself for,

372
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:12,950
you know,
he had this big rivalry with may hand.

373
00:17:12,951 --> 00:17:14,990
They went through a whole season of the 
ultimate fighter together,

374
00:17:14,991 --> 00:17:19,991
talk to all kinds of shit to each other,
and he just fucked him up and he wasn't 

375
00:17:19,991 --> 00:17:21,160
even being like congratulatory about it.

376
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,300
He was concentrating on what he didn't 
do well,

377
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:27,800
but he wanted to own them perfectly.
You know what I see with him is his life

378
00:17:27,801 --> 00:17:30,020
has come full circle.
He's come,

379
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:32,660
he's become completely moved his family 
over from England.

380
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,930
He's training down in Orange County.
He's got his family with them,

381
00:17:35,931 --> 00:17:38,240
which makes a big difference when you 
fucking training.

382
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:40,660
He already took the knockout.
No,

383
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:43,430
he got that knock out again.
Tennis and he caught himself,

384
00:17:43,431 --> 00:17:46,460
found himself and he's ready.
He's ready.

385
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:47,510
He's much better now.
Yeah,

386
00:17:47,511 --> 00:17:52,511
he's much better now.
He's a better place if they say it's 

387
00:17:52,511 --> 00:17:52,511
hard

388
00:17:52,511 --> 00:17:52,560
for a fighter to rebound from a loss 
like that,

389
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,270
you know,
it's very difficult.

390
00:17:54,271 --> 00:17:55,260
I mean,
I can only imagine.

391
00:17:55,261 --> 00:18:00,261
I'm only speculating,
but from what I've experienced watching 

392
00:18:00,261 --> 00:18:00,261
people,
you know,

393
00:18:00,261 --> 00:18:01,440
fighters will change from losses.
Catch

394
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:04,550
fucking knock Gavigan tendus and 
that'll,

395
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:09,620
you know,
just getting beat up at the fucking 

396
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:09,620
pizza parlor.
Changes a motherfucker want to knock out

397
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:09,660
like that

398
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:13,540
came back strong.
Dennis Kang and one of the big things is

399
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:16,450
Dennis Kang caught him.
Remember Dennis Kang tagged and with the

400
00:18:16,451 --> 00:18:18,130
right hand,
dropped them a jumped on him,

401
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,920
but he stayed calm.
He used his guard,

402
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:23,620
he had a real good defensive guard,
locked them up.

403
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:26,080
And then the second run he beat the shit
out of him today.

404
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,520
Know people sleep on them.
Man.

405
00:18:27,521 --> 00:18:29,900
I don't know why it's real weird.
It's like I,

406
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:34,901
I see them sleeping on him and I think 
it's because maybe you see a guy lose 

407
00:18:34,901 --> 00:18:36,370
once and you think that's how the guy 
flights,

408
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:41,610
you know,
instead of saying it's looking at the 

409
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:43,861
whole picture,
that motherfucker had a draw with 

410
00:18:43,861 --> 00:18:43,861
Rashad.
Dude.

411
00:18:43,861 --> 00:18:44,740
You know,
he didn't he or was it Tito?

412
00:18:44,741 --> 00:18:45,730
How to draw with them?
No,

413
00:18:45,731 --> 00:18:46,390
it was,
it was,

414
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:47,950
uh,
did he lose to Rashad?

415
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,030
I think it was a draw.

416
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,410
What's the draw?
Okay.

417
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:53,680
I don't know.
I feel like I feel like I just made that

418
00:18:53,681 --> 00:18:54,260
up.
But it was,

419
00:18:54,261 --> 00:18:55,300
yeah,
let me check.

420
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:56,960
Let me look under shirt.
Org Dot net.

421
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:57,910
Oh,
someone.

422
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Someone from shirt or wrote some whole 
thing saying that I hate shirt off 

423
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,250
because I was talking shit about their 
forums.

424
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:08,430
Listen man,
I don't particularly completely hate 

425
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:11,071
anybody.
I'm sure your forums have some nice 

426
00:19:11,071 --> 00:19:13,570
people on it and every form has a bunch 
of consulting including my own.

427
00:19:13,571 --> 00:19:16,740
So I love all around vegges.
All right.

428
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,310
Um,
so yeah,

429
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:22,640
stats who would go,
bulk of them have a one at the end.

430
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:26,380
Yeah.
They say,

431
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:31,390
Hey,
let's just not make for fucking 

432
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:31,390
thrilling podcast.

433
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:31,390
Yeah,
let's talk numbers.

434
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:32,780
Joy,
what would you say?

435
00:19:32,781 --> 00:19:35,750
Uh,
his stats would be fucking stats.

436
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:40,780
I don't know who Brian is.
The girlfriend was doing his impression 

437
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,440
right now of what he thinks like a 
sportscaster would do.

438
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:44,650
He Won A.
Rashad wanted a decision,

439
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,490
you have it,
but you know,

440
00:19:46,491 --> 00:19:49,690
he was fighting much bigger.
Guys should never been fighting it to.

441
00:19:49,691 --> 00:19:51,940
Oh,
he's a tiny two old timey guy.

442
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:55,610
He's just not.
I would not say he's a tiny guy.

443
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:57,230
He's a big one.
80 five.

444
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:59,790
The first time I seen,
what's his name and uh,

445
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:00,770
in,
in,

446
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,600
in Pittsburgh,
Anthony Johnson.

447
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:04,400
I thought he was a fucking defensive 
tackle.

448
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:04,850
Yeah.
He's,

449
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,960
you know,
those guys and being compared to the 

450
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:09,960
hands of time.
Have you see,

451
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:14,080
you know,
when you see a WHO's the forrest 

452
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:14,080
griffin?
I took the bait.

453
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:14,570
They released Anthony Johnson.
Yeah,

454
00:20:14,571 --> 00:20:15,290
I know that.
That's.

455
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,120
What did you think the thing that was 
gonna happen.

456
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,540
So I knew right then and there when you.
I read the twit.

457
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:21,710
I bet if he won,
if he won,

458
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,150
he probably would have been able to keep
his job.

459
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:27,600
He would had to come out and knock his 
fucking head off in Brazil at home.

460
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:29,120
Knock him when he tried,
man,

461
00:20:29,121 --> 00:20:34,121
I'm telling you,
he blew his wad going out and trying 

462
00:20:34,121 --> 00:20:34,121
because he tried to kill vetoer.
He went after him.

463
00:20:34,121 --> 00:20:35,980
Man.
It was blue is one is actually a,

464
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,760
a gambling term,
Brian,

465
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:41,540
for you don't know.
It was a wad of cash.

466
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:44,630
And when you come out of the gates 
strong and gambling and then you have no

467
00:20:44,631 --> 00:20:45,650
more money.
It's called the blue.

468
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,040
It's white.
You Know Dana?

469
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,490
Dane is really fucking fair.
Dan is very fair.

470
00:20:51,491 --> 00:20:52,690
No,
he listened to Anthony.

471
00:20:52,691 --> 00:20:54,750
I think ms dot wait three times.
Yes,

472
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,500
and that's 12 pounds over that.

473
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,520
Well,
he had a medical situation this time.

474
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,830
I mean you can't.
He.

475
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,300
She was cutting too much,
but he had a medical situation this time

476
00:21:04,301 --> 00:21:05,770
where he.
His legs stop working.

477
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,190
Right?
I heard that.

478
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:13,110
Which is fucking crazy.
It really stop and think these guys get 

479
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:16,570
down to that dehydrated state and then 
rehydrate up and fight the next day.

480
00:21:16,571 --> 00:21:21,571
I mean it's.
Someone needs to talk to that dude and 

481
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:21,571
say,
listen man,

482
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:25,351
you got it.
You don't need to put on any more 

483
00:21:25,351 --> 00:21:25,351
muscle.
Okay.

484
00:21:25,351 --> 00:21:25,351
What you need to do is just lose some of
them.

485
00:21:25,351 --> 00:21:26,450
Also.
You got legit.

486
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:28,750
Don't need to be that big.
You're a fucking monster.

487
00:21:28,751 --> 00:21:30,850
Loose some of it.
You're going to fight it.

488
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:35,860
One 85.
You should walk around no bigger than 

489
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:35,860
one 95.
Really?

490
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,180
You really shouldn't be cutting that 
much weight.

491
00:21:37,181 --> 00:21:42,181
You're a super athlete.
He's like totally selling himself short 

492
00:21:42,181 --> 00:21:45,340
by dehydrating himself and draining 
himself for these fights.

493
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:48,440
So when it gets in like grueling fights,
like the cost check five,

494
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:50,470
he gets tired,
the vituro fight,

495
00:21:50,471 --> 00:21:51,980
he gets tired.
Man,

496
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,200
I'm awesome.
Burns a lot.

497
00:21:53,201 --> 00:21:55,760
But when burns even more is when you 
dehydration,

498
00:21:55,761 --> 00:21:57,790
hydrate the fuck out of your body,
you know,

499
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:00,890
I id hydrated my body when I fought and 
taekwondo tournament.

500
00:22:00,891 --> 00:22:04,750
So I did that to make way when I fought 
it when I was in like 16,

501
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:07,750
I was fighting at 1:40
and I didn't weigh 1:40

502
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:12,900
and I didn't do it right either.
I would just like take hot showers and 

503
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,260
take hot baths and not drink any water 
for like a day.

504
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,170
And then I'd weigh in and I have to 
rehydrate and fight that day.

505
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,720
And I know what it feels like.
It's a terrible feeling.

506
00:22:19,721 --> 00:22:22,360
It makes you feel like shit to stupid 
thing.

507
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:24,190
I mean I did it because it was an idiot 
because I,

508
00:22:24,191 --> 00:22:26,650
you know,
and I was being instructed that I should

509
00:22:26,651 --> 00:22:27,550
stay in that weight class.

510
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:30,900
He's got 50 fucking pounds to cut.
He.

511
00:22:30,901 --> 00:22:33,370
So the month before that.
Not only that dude,

512
00:22:33,371 --> 00:22:36,820
he's so fucking big fucking pounds.
It is.

513
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,610
Muslims,
a lot of it's muscle mass,

514
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:40,810
muscle mass.
He's a super athlete.

515
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:46,020
That fucking guy,
man could be fighting it to look bad.

516
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:49,690
Pick on what's going on with the fucking
pickles.

517
00:22:49,691 --> 00:22:50,890
And uh,
and the other thing.

518
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:52,000
Oh,
olive garden.

519
00:22:52,001 --> 00:22:53,190
Ocean Boulevard,
ocean.

520
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,400
God.
Now who the fuck joey.

521
00:22:54,401 --> 00:22:56,790
When is the last time you blew your wide
bullets?

522
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,080
What do you mean?
Gambling or just whacked?

523
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:03,920
Whacked off.
And who the fuck knows guy off the hump?

524
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:04,900
Pillows.
Do you take time?

525
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,660
No,
I work well from time to time.

526
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,880
The shower a couple of minutes here and 
there or something.

527
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:14,550
I'd bang one out in my cappuccino style.
Does Chaz Bono have the Dick now?

528
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:17,680
Probably.
I mean I haven't asked her,

529
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:22,980
you know,
coffee being I'll say just show me that 

530
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:23,200
fucking pickled.
It's really crazy that she,

531
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:25,570
you know,
she had a girlfriend and they broke up,

532
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:27,520
but you know,
the girlfriend was like,

533
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:32,800
she had a girlfriend and she was a girl 
and then she decided she was a man.

534
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:37,920
And then the girl like,
could you imagine like if you're a 

535
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:37,920
lesbian and then all sudden the person 
that you're with becomes a man.

536
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,450
That's the best revenge ever.
This,

537
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:40,720
that's the best route.
You know,

538
00:23:40,721 --> 00:23:42,030
I'll get back at,
you know,

539
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:45,040
and she'll get a couple of girlfriends.
She'll get a couple of girlfriends.

540
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:45,970
Novelty.
It's a

541
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:46,890
novelty.
Oh my God.

542
00:23:46,891 --> 00:23:47,290
There.
Yeah.

543
00:23:47,291 --> 00:23:49,970
And then you take them home and a dick.
Smells like a Twat.

544
00:23:49,971 --> 00:23:54,971
And then you're saying you will see 
after you ran three miles,

545
00:23:55,941 --> 00:23:59,510
what's the difference that Dick and I 
meet the fucking monkey here.

546
00:23:59,511 --> 00:24:03,130
You know what the difference?
You can't take away the smell it.

547
00:24:03,131 --> 00:24:04,910
You know,
you can't put a fake dick on.

548
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,610
It ain't going to fucking pants.
They make balls.

549
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:08,390
Yeah,
they do.

550
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:13,420
They do.
I mean they make neoprene balls or 

551
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:15,681
something that,
let's say you have little balls are big 

552
00:24:15,681 --> 00:24:16,700
balls and you could listen if you get 
anything.

553
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,350
She's switching to real patois.
We could change around just because,

554
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:26,590
you know,
I think that I like fucking Doris Day 

555
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:26,720
music and one day I want to be a woman.
It just,

556
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,700
I think that's a little bit more than 
that.

557
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,450
I think that it's just a little bit 
fucking more than that.

558
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:33,070
Yeah,
it's.

559
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:34,850
I'm not against it.
I don't know.

560
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:38,030
The guy who does a is a,
is a guy that lives in Colorado.

561
00:24:38,031 --> 00:24:43,031
The busiest guy look him up is a guy 
that lives in southern Colorado and he 

562
00:24:43,031 --> 00:24:46,811
doesn't mind the weekends.
He's booked eight years in advance and 

563
00:24:46,811 --> 00:24:47,570
really he has a regular job during the 
week.

564
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,810
I don't want to quote it.
We've talked about this before.

565
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:56,080
You have to look it up.
It was on 60 minutes and then the 

566
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,830
weekends he does the operations.
He's booked three years in advance,

567
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:03,070
I think during the week.
He's like a farmer or aphasia 

568
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:03,200
assumptions.
Fucking crazy.

569
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:08,460
And on the weekends he cut your fucking 
Dick off and puts that fucking monkey 

570
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:12,911
that,
that chicken we met in Vegas with the 

571
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:12,911
artificial turf and the fucking holes 
that time.

572
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:16,810
Remember Riviera's member reviewing.
The security came and tapped.

573
00:25:16,811 --> 00:25:21,140
As you're talking to a fucking Javier,
get confused and you know what,

574
00:25:21,141 --> 00:25:23,460
if I have had a couple bumps in me,
I will let that thing suck.

575
00:25:23,461 --> 00:25:27,000
My Dick wasn't that bad without official
turf monkey and shit.

576
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,710
You Finger Bang that in the whole 
lighter.

577
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:37,460
Julie's said Jodi and said,
it looks like a bat.

578
00:25:37,461 --> 00:25:38,930
What?
Oh my God.

579
00:25:38,931 --> 00:25:43,370
It was the ugliest fucking thing you had
ever seen and it just freaked you out.

580
00:25:43,371 --> 00:25:46,630
Like you just don't want to eat no more 
like you didn't want to drink like none.

581
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,910
It was going to take away the pain and 
they're much better at doing it now.

582
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:53,270
Apparently now they can construct a 
pretty realistic looking vagina.

583
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,070
The point where it really fucks people 
up.

584
00:25:55,071 --> 00:25:59,080
We'll fucking fucking cups with a vagina
on it will fucking cups.

585
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:02,870
Flashlight is a cup with a fucking 
vagina on it that you know,

586
00:26:02,871 --> 00:26:07,871
whatever feels it doesn't go cocktails.
You don't know what you're fucking 

587
00:26:07,871 --> 00:26:11,111
dude's some dudes.
Men have no problem like having sex with

588
00:26:11,181 --> 00:26:11,700
a,
a.

589
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:16,710
he's like a girl that used to be a guy 
as long as it's a girl now she's a guy.

590
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:17,870
Girl.
Man,

591
00:26:17,871 --> 00:26:18,830
she's a girl,
man,

592
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:24,100
I ain't got no problem with that.
Like there's dudes that will tell you 

593
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:24,100
they have no problem with that.
They think that it's a girl,

594
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,170
but there's other dudes just like,
listen,

595
00:26:27,171 --> 00:26:29,900
when you're drunk and it's four in the 
fucking morning,

596
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:35,180
alright,
and you're driving on Santa Monica and 

597
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:35,180
you haven't gotten your Dick Sucked and 
60,

598
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:35,720
70,
80 days.

599
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,220
All right.
And you're driving,

600
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:39,470
you're fucked up and you got to gram a 
blow in your pocket.

601
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:42,150
That chick with the blonde hair becomes 
whatever you want it.

602
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:46,460
You pull over and do a couple lines and 
had that fucking monster suction pipe.

603
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,720
Why?
There's no,

604
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:49,680
it's happening.
I know it's happened.

605
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:54,690
It's had no,
I'm just going for broke tonight and 

606
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:55,370
fuck it.
And after she sucked your Dick,

607
00:26:55,380 --> 00:27:00,380
you just make a quick fucking turn and 
throw out of the car and you drive home 

608
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:02,010
and hope there's no fucking satellites 
around taking cameras.

609
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:04,140
What are you going to do?
What the fuck are you going to do?

610
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,390
Some dudes,
it becomes a utility thing.

611
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:08,010
It's like you can't get rid of this 
stuff.

612
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:13,070
Absolutely.
I bet that this guys out there that is 

613
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:15,201
so fucking crazy on it that they don't 
even care until they come and it's like 

614
00:27:15,201 --> 00:27:16,230
anything else.
How many times have you started whacking

615
00:27:16,231 --> 00:27:21,231
off and all the sudden you start 
thinking of women that think those suck 

616
00:27:21,231 --> 00:27:21,231
your Dick,
but after you crack that nut,

617
00:27:21,231 --> 00:27:22,920
you just put your phone down.
I already cracked my neck.

618
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:25,740
I'm going to put up with that crazy bits
talking nonsense.

619
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:27,790
You know what I'm saying?
I just,

620
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,630
I just wiped myself off the debt deal.
I need this shit.

621
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,870
You're projecting.
It's true.

622
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:39,530
I would never come if I don't come in in
a certain amount of time that I'm not 

623
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:43,640
going to go to a tranny tranny.

624
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:47,520
Just looking at a training makes me 
sick.

625
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:52,820
Like when you make that right turn.
I'm fucking Santa Monica and you go up 

626
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:56,321
highland or Libretto.
The best is if you get up early in the 

627
00:27:56,321 --> 00:27:59,661
morning,
like you have to go somewhere to the 

628
00:27:59,661 --> 00:27:59,661
airport and you take love bread down 
five in the morning,

629
00:27:59,661 --> 00:27:59,970
right?
Man,

630
00:27:59,971 --> 00:28:01,980
I don't think they'll have brand Santa 
Monica.

631
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:03,960
There's 20 of them and let me tell you 
something.

632
00:28:03,961 --> 00:28:07,520
I'm here to tell you a man that I am.
I don't.

633
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:12,970
You can't fucking tell to you pulled 
over it until you pull over and look at 

634
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:13,080
them.
You don't know,

635
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,980
and by that time you're 50 percent.
There was a dude who was an Iraqi vet,

636
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:19,740
picked up a hooker,
came back from Iraq,

637
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,330
picked up a hooker,
hooker,

638
00:28:21,331 --> 00:28:23,820
blows them,
finds out the hookers or guy,

639
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:26,580
shoot some cops,
see him,

640
00:28:26,581 --> 00:28:30,630
dumped the body out of his car.
High speed chase that go to the desert.

641
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,240
He jumps out of the car with the gun 
suicide by cop.

642
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,450
Wow.
Oh,

643
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:38,400
because he couldn't deal with the fact 
that the dude sucked his dick.

644
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:44,020
So you had to kill the guy.
If he just let that guy go and laughed 

645
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:46,740
it off.
What a fucking story.

646
00:28:46,741 --> 00:28:48,840
Who would have been a great story?

647
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:54,720
It was one of us.
You can be at parties and be like,

648
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:57,460
tell him about that time that sucked 
your Dick.

649
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,800
All right,
come on over.

650
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:04,570
I'm going to just tell it.
I'll tie the bitch up and call you guys 

651
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:05,720
and we'll do a podcast with him.
Nobody believe it.

652
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:07,920
Listen,
Joe Rogan.

653
00:29:07,921 --> 00:29:09,480
Listen you.
You stopped.

654
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:14,780
You're at a bar.
You pick up a girl that you think you 

655
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:17,241
bring it home.
You go between the legs and she's got a 

656
00:29:17,241 --> 00:29:17,241
nine inch fucking cock.
Let me,

657
00:29:17,241 --> 00:29:19,120
because most of those trainees always 
have the biggest fuck.

658
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,530
Tranny ain't going to have a two inch 
Dick.

659
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,990
They always got a rope between their 
fucking legs.

660
00:29:24,991 --> 00:29:28,960
So you don't think right there when you 
grabbed that laugh,

661
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,300
Joe Rogan.
No,

662
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:35,810
I'd be dangerous.
I'd felt like I was in danger because I 

663
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:35,810
was like,
I got tricked.

664
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:40,570
I feel like I'm getting tricked and if 
you get tricked and all of a sudden the 

665
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:40,570
trick turns out to be a man.

666
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:42,550
That's a dangerous situation when you're
alone with a man.

667
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:46,680
So now you've got to wonder what the 
fuck you gotta fight.

668
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:49,390
You gotta.
Find out if that person's violent.

669
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:51,850
You got to find out that person's 
apologetic.

670
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,570
You got to find out if that person just 
fucked up with a gun in your hand.

671
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,840
All of these things.
I'm going to find that I'm a fine.

672
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:00,830
It's upstairs.
I'll be ready.

673
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,680
I'm going to shove it up.
Your rest.

674
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:06,370
I'm going to come back with that nine 
millimeter at gunpoint.

675
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:07,900
You miserable cock.
Sucker.

676
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,120
Gumby the fucking truth.
How long have you been doing this?

677
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,040
Something.
We've got to do something here.

678
00:30:12,041 --> 00:30:14,770
We just can't let you just.
You're not going to laugh it off.

679
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,460
It's crazy.
Would shoot him.

680
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:19,330
You think you'd tell them something?
I got to kick him in the stomach.

681
00:30:19,331 --> 00:30:19,930
I got to do something.

682
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:22,930
Something's getting a beating.
We got to do something.

683
00:30:22,931 --> 00:30:25,870
I'm calling my friends fluffed up.
I fucked up.

684
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:29,640
I picked up this chicken.
Grab a pussy in it.

685
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:33,950
She had a bigger Dick than me.
What do I do in the morning?

686
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:37,120
Monica Boulevard.
Would you shoot him if he had the gun on

687
00:30:37,121 --> 00:30:39,310
you guys succeed?
Do it.

688
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:42,160
Would it be just get the fuck out of my 
car or would it be bad?

689
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:47,670
Now you threw money at car.
Think of that feeling you're going to 

690
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:50,521
have.
That has to be the worst feeling you're 

691
00:30:50,521 --> 00:30:53,341
going to get back in your car.
You're going to crash your car against 

692
00:30:53,341 --> 00:30:53,341
the fucking wall,
the one 90,

693
00:30:53,341 --> 00:30:55,090
because you can't believe this just 
happened to you.

694
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:58,870
Whenever you do five minutes after you 
find that this person is.

695
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:01,030
It's legal.
I can sell that in court.

696
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,290
I could sell that and caught a lumps.

697
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,600
Let's break it down.
Forget the turn.

698
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:07,930
This is dog and a man.
You ever want to crack a fucking nut?

699
00:31:07,931 --> 00:31:10,540
Late night and a blind heels.
She stuck shit.

700
00:31:10,541 --> 00:31:13,150
Dick and you go for that monkey.
There's a two foot fucking cock.

701
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:15,640
There's three minutes of blackout time 
right there.

702
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,010
Let's get a little conference.
The attorneys,

703
00:31:18,011 --> 00:31:20,230
how long did he do?
Did he bring her home and shoot shooter?

704
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:22,120
If you shoot it within four or five 
minutes,

705
00:31:22,121 --> 00:31:27,121
this temporary insanity.
Think of water is going to feel like 

706
00:31:27,121 --> 00:31:30,670
you're right.
I don't know if he could call a 

707
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:30,670
temporary insanity.
You wouldn't get.

708
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:32,080
You wouldn't get life.
You don't know that.

709
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:35,980
It means it might've.
It might've been some sort of an assault

710
00:31:35,981 --> 00:31:37,570
situation,
so the car as well.

711
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:41,680
We don't know when he confronted them.
It could have been that the guy attacked

712
00:31:41,681 --> 00:31:44,050
him first and then he got pulled his gun
out.

713
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,540
I mean,
he's probably freaked.

714
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,450
Well,
who the fuck knows?

715
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,100
We're just totally SPEC.
I'll tell you.

716
00:31:48,101 --> 00:31:51,760
That was a soldier and Iraqi soldier 
came back.

717
00:31:51,761 --> 00:31:54,370
I mean all this guy had to do was pull 
over and tell the cops,

718
00:31:54,371 --> 00:31:55,900
well first let me talk to you.
What happened?

719
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:58,100
Let me tell you what really happened to 
us.

720
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:03,510
I'm a little horn in my country and some
guy just suck my dick and I shot him.

721
00:32:04,031 --> 00:32:06,530
What do you think?
We're going to let this go.

722
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:09,200
Still get some.
They don't ever let it go.

723
00:32:09,201 --> 00:32:13,540
When someone shoots somebody listening,
you get to good cops in the right mood.

724
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:18,870
One of them just got,
the other one's got a brother who's gay 

725
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:21,190
and you don't like thanksgiving.
You know what I'm saying?

726
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:24,190
And also what some guy sucked your Dick.
We feel for you.

727
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:26,440
Get back in the car.
We'll just wrap this up.

728
00:32:26,441 --> 00:32:28,810
Let somebody find.
I think a guy would.

729
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:32,650
That might've happened in the sixties,
but nowadays,

730
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:34,690
well now,
because you got the.

731
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,360
Yes.
Yeah.

732
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:42,780
Back in the day,
cops were the only ones that were able 

733
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:42,780
to talk

734
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:42,780
and make a decision.
Right then they can be.

735
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:43,390
Yeah,
they could be in the car with a little,

736
00:32:43,391 --> 00:32:44,320
you know,
one out of 12,

737
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:45,080
1:00
AM 12,

738
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:48,410
and we're closing a suspect.
Now you've got cameras.

739
00:32:48,411 --> 00:32:49,610
You can't do nothing,
but still.

740
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,560
Joe,
let me talk to you on this side.

741
00:32:51,561 --> 00:32:56,561
It's a quarter to 12.
We've got this Puerto Rican chick that 

742
00:32:56,561 --> 00:32:58,691
wants to suck my dick.
She likes when I come over with my gun 

743
00:32:58,691 --> 00:32:58,691
holster around.
This guy just killed the training.

744
00:32:58,691 --> 00:33:00,800
We've got no paperwork here.
Is that what it is?

745
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:01,660
Sure.
That's.

746
00:33:01,661 --> 00:33:03,590
You know,
he doesn't matter,

747
00:33:03,591 --> 00:33:05,210
Joe.
You still have to account for a murder.

748
00:33:05,211 --> 00:33:10,211
That's the problem with your theory,
but he'll have to account for a guy was 

749
00:33:10,211 --> 00:33:10,280
shot a guy.
Understand this.

750
00:33:10,281 --> 00:33:12,020
You have a suspect that have it all 
wrapped up.

751
00:33:12,021 --> 00:33:14,870
Are you thinking of with them and tell 
the court the truth.

752
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:17,390
You get off of involuntary man's want to
do six years.

753
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:22,690
They cut that in half.
You're out of that and a couple fucking 

754
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:25,020
months really,
and you got to shoot somebody and have 

755
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:27,431
some fun and get your degree three years
to shoot somebody and get your Dick 

756
00:33:28,471 --> 00:33:29,480
sucked.
Let's a lot of fun.

757
00:33:29,481 --> 00:33:34,481
That shoots and the smell.
The gunpowder in prison food was really 

758
00:33:34,481 --> 00:33:34,481
bad.
Oh,

759
00:33:34,481 --> 00:33:37,961
it's terrible.
But you've got a good attorney and 

760
00:33:37,961 --> 00:33:39,681
negotiate it down.
Do you remember cafeteria food like in 

761
00:33:39,681 --> 00:33:39,681
college or high school?
It's just like horrible.

762
00:33:39,681 --> 00:33:41,510
Fucking horrible.
It's like a different.

763
00:33:41,511 --> 00:33:46,511
It's like Mcdonald's fit prison.
Have you seen this new bill they're 

764
00:33:46,511 --> 00:33:49,871
trying to pass now.
That would make make it possible to 

765
00:33:49,871 --> 00:33:53,201
strip anybody have citizenship if they a
proposed a threat to America.

766
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,070
They're American citizens.
Yeah,

767
00:33:55,071 --> 00:33:56,390
I heard about that.
It snuck in.

768
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:56,630
Got It.

769
00:33:56,630 --> 00:34:01,630
Yeah.
So what are you going to take it back 

770
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:01,630
to?
It's like the keep.

771
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:04,350
I don't know.
They're going to kick you out of the 

772
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:05,771
country.
They keep coming up with crazier and 

773
00:34:05,771 --> 00:34:08,330
crazier fucking things.
It's like this is the year of like total

774
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:13,510
complete control.
Like they're trying to control the 

775
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:17,561
Internet,
that trying to control this national 

776
00:34:17,561 --> 00:34:19,760
defense authorization act.
They're trying Sopa and Pipa,

777
00:34:19,761 --> 00:34:23,270
all this different shit that's going on.
It's like the control is getting tighter

778
00:34:23,271 --> 00:34:25,490
and tighter and tighter and when you 
hear shit like this,

779
00:34:25,491 --> 00:34:30,491
like they want to be able to strip 
people of their citizenship like what 

780
00:34:30,491 --> 00:34:34,151
the fuck?
Like Mexico or somewhere that'll take 

781
00:34:34,641 --> 00:34:36,290
you.
I mean there's a few countries that will

782
00:34:36,291 --> 00:34:36,880
just take.
Yeah,

783
00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:38,810
that seems like illegal.
Like worldwide.

784
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,000
It's possible.
This is the strangest time in my life 

785
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:49,860
of,
of like watching the government and 

786
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:49,950
watching all these people scrambled to 
try to get into position.

787
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:51,810
Like this is a weird time,
man.

788
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:53,480
This,
this feels so bizarre.

789
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:55,310
I never thought I would see something 
like that.

790
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:58,400
Like someone writing something down like
that,

791
00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:03,410
like that.
You should be able to have the power to 

792
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:07,121
kick people out of the country if 
somehow or another they do something to 

793
00:35:07,121 --> 00:35:07,121
harm America,
but that's,

794
00:35:07,121 --> 00:35:09,950
you know how ridiculous that is.
No one's harming America.

795
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:15,040
They're coming up all these fucking 
crazy laws and the ability to detain 

796
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,640
people,
but what is really happening here?

797
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:19,640
Nothing.
Nothing's happening in America.

798
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:24,760
Nothing.
The only thing that's happening is that 

799
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,880
people are saying they're not happy with
the current government.

800
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:28,250
That's the only action that's happening 
in the whole country.

801
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:33,460
It's not like there's some fucking crazy
thing going on where we're being 

802
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:37,091
constantly attacked by terrorists and we
have to figure out how to defend 

803
00:35:37,091 --> 00:35:38,340
ourselves and an ever changing world.
Now there's fucking terror attacks

804
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,410
and I don't say they're.
They're catching them all.

805
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:42,720
I don't really think there's that many 
terrorists out there.

806
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:48,020
I don't really think there's that many 
people that fucking hate us and I think 

807
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:50,811
that number would be substantially less 
if we weren't occupying another fucking 

808
00:35:50,811 --> 00:35:51,660
countries,
but the bottom line is they're coming up

809
00:35:51,661 --> 00:35:53,650
with all these,
these does this,

810
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:57,450
these laws that are set up to control us
and to shackle us,

811
00:35:57,451 --> 00:36:02,451
to put us down in there protecting us 
from what these laws are for what?

812
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:07,910
Where is this threat?
Where's this threat in our country that 

813
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:10,470
you need to create these laws will.
The only threat is to the power that be.

814
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:14,120
That's the only threat.
The powers that be are the only ones who

815
00:36:14,121 --> 00:36:15,570
are being threatened.
That's it.

816
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:18,480
It's not like we have to worry about 
terrorist attacks,

817
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:19,920
you know?
That's a fucking.

818
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,600
That's a bullshit thing,
man.

819
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:24,000
There's not that many fucking 
terrorists.

820
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,710
There's not that many.
Yeah,

821
00:36:25,711 --> 00:36:28,540
there are some and yeah,
there are plots and yes,

822
00:36:28,541 --> 00:36:33,541
some are legit,
but did the laws that they're coming up 

823
00:36:33,541 --> 00:36:36,981
with band,
they're not doing this to protect us 

824
00:36:36,981 --> 00:36:36,981
from terrorism.
They're doing this to make it harder for

825
00:36:36,981 --> 00:36:40,470
people to get up and protest.
That's what the fuck they're doing.

826
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:45,090
It says this a spooky,
spooky time to watch this shit go down.

827
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:50,480
It's like this is everything.
They warned us about the founding 

828
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:50,480
fathers.
This is.

829
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,390
This is everything.
Benjamin Franklin said,

830
00:36:51,391 --> 00:36:53,850
this is bizarre.
It's like they predicted it.

831
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:58,560
They predicted that one day there would 
become a point of ultimate corruption.

832
00:36:58,561 --> 00:37:03,561
You have to do everything you can and 
keep these pieces in place in order to 

833
00:37:03,561 --> 00:37:03,561
avoid that.
Ultimately

834
00:37:03,561 --> 00:37:08,200
corruption is communist.
To read deep communism is government 

835
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:12,400
isn't three d water,
like they come on your computers posts 

836
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:17,590
that pull you over and take your fucking
asked you for an id and I understand 

837
00:37:17,651 --> 00:37:19,570
your protectiveness,
but again,

838
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:24,870
protecting us from how much money you 
got.

839
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,720
Middle America running fucking scared 
would see in the media running scared,

840
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:29,720
you know,
and,

841
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:32,350
and they don't know,
they really don't fucking know that.

842
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:36,130
They're scaring us into giving us us 
giving up our rights.

843
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:38,020
Yeah.
They want us to do,

844
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:40,240
give us our fucking rights by scaring 
us.

845
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:42,040
Well,
if you don't let me fuck an x ray,

846
00:37:42,041 --> 00:37:44,350
you'll,
we can't catch a fucking whatever.

847
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,120
If you know,
it's always something.

848
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:51,130
These fall laws,
it's always fucking something every 

849
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:51,130
week.
Well,

850
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:54,541
you know,
there's a lot of people that believe 

851
00:37:54,541 --> 00:37:55,810
that the government would have tried 
some sort of a false flag event.

852
00:37:56,050 --> 00:38:01,050
You know,
the false flag event is an event that 

853
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:03,430
like they'll do something on purpose in 
order to get us to realize,

854
00:38:03,431 --> 00:38:05,710
whoa,
there's a threat we need to like beef up

855
00:38:05,711 --> 00:38:07,510
the law.
And that's like shit that they've pulled

856
00:38:07,511 --> 00:38:12,511
since the beginning of time.
But there's a lot of people that don't 

857
00:38:12,511 --> 00:38:13,780
believe they can do that today.
They think that it's too easy.

858
00:38:13,781 --> 00:38:18,781
The access to information is just too 
easy to spread and that with the 

859
00:38:18,781 --> 00:38:19,060
Internet it's so difficult to control 
things.

860
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:21,580
They don't think they could do it.
What happened to the occupy movement?

861
00:38:21,581 --> 00:38:23,830
I didn't believe I was still going on 
when everyone,

862
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,480
olive garden they occupy or where the 
fuck are these people?

863
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:33,870
Where the fuck are they protesting 
against American airline with a $20 

864
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:35,900
dollar luggages when people,
American Airlines,

865
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:38,650
everybody's paying the 20 foot of 
luggage were all these.

866
00:38:38,651 --> 00:38:43,651
I don't think money would have occupied.
That's back Merrigan airline luggage 

867
00:38:46,841 --> 00:38:51,841
thing I can on every day for that fly 
southwest or I fucking loved it.

868
00:38:53,711 --> 00:38:55,120
I thought to take.
For me,

869
00:38:55,121 --> 00:38:57,590
I think that all we got to do is bring 
pathways.

870
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:02,640
Corporations back to the United States.
I don't care if you want to open up 

871
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,530
something of what.
You got to open up one here too.

872
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:10,400
You've got to pay taxes for this one and
then do whatever the fuck you want in 

873
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,380
Beijing with Hindus or whatever the fuck
you want to do.

874
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:14,750
And that's what's killed Middle America.
They've left Pittsburgh.

875
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:17,720
There's no more manufacturing.
Well,

876
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:19,510
that's what I,
that's what I want back.

877
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,190
You know,
we can have some fucking job.

878
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:23,470
We've talked about this before,
but like ipods,

879
00:39:23,471 --> 00:39:24,430
like a or a,
you know,

880
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:25,090
an iphone.

881
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:30,120
I would pay,
I would pay like double the amount of 

882
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,260
money for a Karma free iphone.
There was more,

883
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:36,300
you know,
that American workers is what it would 

884
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:36,300
cost.
Yeah,

885
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:36,550
I heard that.
But you know,

886
00:39:36,551 --> 00:39:38,530
here are the,
here's the problem with that logic,

887
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:41,170
the minerals,
the minerals to make those phones.

888
00:39:41,171 --> 00:39:44,590
You have to get an Africa and you've 
seen how they get those minerals.

889
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:45,210
Man,
that's,

890
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:49,030
that's at the end of the most 
complicated shit that we have.

891
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:54,060
Technology at its root is a kid in 
Africa working in a fucking mind,

892
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:58,030
pulling shit out of the ground with a 
piece of metal and a stick.

893
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:58,660
I mean,
it's,

894
00:39:58,661 --> 00:39:59,310
it's,
it's as,

895
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:04,600
as base as you can get,
child fucking slavery in Africa,

896
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:07,750
making,
extracting minerals is super common.

897
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:09,080
You know,
it's,

898
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:10,150
it's,
you know,

899
00:40:10,151 --> 00:40:15,151
they had that advice special.
Well they did on it when they went to 

900
00:40:15,151 --> 00:40:15,670
the Congo and watch these guys and it's 
um,

901
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:18,130
it's,
it's weird to think that that's the only

902
00:40:18,131 --> 00:40:18,940
way you could do that.

903
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:22,150
The only way you can get those minerals 
is you've got to go there.

904
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:23,240
That's where they're at.
But,

905
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:23,890
and you know,
their,

906
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:28,900
their sense of I want to have kids just 
so I have them doing chores because I 

907
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:32,140
don't want to have a made in my house.
But it seems like when I was young I had

908
00:40:32,141 --> 00:40:34,240
to like clean the living room.
Went to once a time.

909
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,120
And that's kind of like having your kid 
being a child labor,

910
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:38,920
you know,
like you're making them clean your house

911
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,030
chores,
children,

912
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:47,040
responsibility rooms,
scrub bathrooms because kids have to 

913
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:47,650
have responsibility,
learn to contribute.

914
00:40:47,651 --> 00:40:52,000
I am happy my parents made me do chores 
because it taught me how to work hard.

915
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:56,110
Father taught me how to just hit it off 
and fucking work hard.

916
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:59,560
I think my parents took advantage of me 
and I was mowing lawns and shit and then

917
00:40:59,561 --> 00:41:01,060
I'm like,
looking back on man,

918
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:06,090
I need that in my life right now.
I need to have kids just to clean this 

919
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:09,841
place up because I'm tired of doing it.
I'm not sure how the fuck that works 

920
00:41:09,841 --> 00:41:14,281
with child labor in Africa on phones.
I'm not sure how you made that 

921
00:41:14,381 --> 00:41:17,230
connection because it's like making kids
work.

922
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:20,920
Like you can kiss world of your own 
body.

923
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:25,320
His work helping out and contributing it
at home is not working.

924
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:30,250
My mother used it.
It's fucked up man.

925
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:32,030
What's up?
My mother used to work.

926
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,430
Make me fucking.
I might stop the empty

927
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:39,670
the tampon things.
Lindemann's fucking bathroom at my 

928
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:43,451
mother's bar when I was sick and put ice
cubes in the fucking urinals and fucking

929
00:41:43,971 --> 00:41:47,670
stuck to the ice cube.
So it doesn't splatter back at you or is

930
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:52,671
it just to make clay gamed it.
My Dad was an architect so most of my 

931
00:41:52,671 --> 00:41:55,190
jobs and I got summer jobs and shit.
It was always on construction sites,

932
00:41:55,430 --> 00:42:00,430
so I've worked like real jobs.
I had some real construction jobs and 

933
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:00,590
especially,
you know,

934
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:03,310
after I graduated I had some that went 
through the winter.

935
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:07,250
We worked outside in the winter.
Once you know,

936
00:42:07,251 --> 00:42:09,020
it's no,
those are real jobs.

937
00:42:09,021 --> 00:42:13,480
Those are my best days in Colorado.
Flat roofs back.

938
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:18,530
I'm in the dead of the winter.
One day I took a shit in a bag and 

939
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:20,000
crunched it up and gave it to one of the
workers and told them it was a brown.

940
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,330
Like 10 minutes later he's like,
this brown.

941
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:23,760
It smells like shit.
We're fucking.

942
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,840
I used to be a fucking roof and 
estimating ruth.

943
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:31,640
When I got out of prison,
I was in the halfway house.

944
00:42:31,641 --> 00:42:36,641
I was an estimator for,
but I started out as a fucking bloating 

945
00:42:36,641 --> 00:42:41,321
the roofs in boulder,
Colorado in January and snow and you got

946
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:44,990
to get up there and shovel the snow.
Then cut it and throw it in and then.

947
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,230
Aw,
Geez.

948
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,930
We used to build Igloos to fucking put 
rubber down on the roofs.

949
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,370
That's fucking crazy.
Well,

950
00:42:52,371 --> 00:42:57,371
they work.
That's the thing about you still build 

951
00:42:57,371 --> 00:42:57,371
Igloos.
What do you mean?

952
00:42:57,371 --> 00:43:00,550
Right,
so let's say you have to lay down a 40 

953
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:03,380
squares of rubber that day with 
ballasted with rocks.

954
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:07,160
We would shovel the roof at after the 
fucking shoveling.

955
00:43:07,161 --> 00:43:09,320
We laid the insulation down,
but it was snowing,

956
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:14,590
so three labors will be cutting the roof
and the other three were building poles 

957
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:18,491
with a cover so the snow wouldn't land 
on the insulation so we'd have to build 

958
00:43:18,491 --> 00:43:18,491
shit when it's.

959
00:43:18,491 --> 00:43:23,200
No,
it was like a New Jersey and New York 

960
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:23,200
City,
which is the biggest metropolitan city.

961
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,100
They get six inches of snow in the city 
closes down.

962
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:28,150
I thought he was like blocking ice and 
making like Colorado.

963
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:30,410
They get a foot of snow and you're at 
work at eight.

964
00:43:30,411 --> 00:43:31,050
Oh,
one second.

965
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,900
Another day of business.
You can't say,

966
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:34,970
well my bus came late because it didn't 
come late.

967
00:43:34,971 --> 00:43:36,830
Bitch.
That motherfucker came on time.

968
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:38,510
They'd been driving in the snow for 20 
years.

969
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:43,780
There's no.
I'm 10 minutes late because there was 

970
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:43,780
snow in Colorado.
It ever is.

971
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:46,940
He knows really impressive.
We were in Montreal in December and it 

972
00:43:47,091 --> 00:43:49,490
was cold as fuck,
but man,

973
00:43:49,491 --> 00:43:52,220
that airport was smooth there.
De Icing.

974
00:43:52,221 --> 00:43:55,160
They had that shit down pat.
Then model allowing,

975
00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:00,440
plowing the.
They were plowing the runways and 

976
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:00,540
cleaning everything needed runway.
Yeah.

977
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:03,440
So they just really fucking amazing.
Amazing.

978
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:05,570
Yeah.
They avoid a lot of bullshit.

979
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,540
They plan well for the,
for the cold up there.

980
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:09,590
It's an.
Yeah,

981
00:44:09,591 --> 00:44:11,540
they do in Colorado too.
They really do.

982
00:44:11,541 --> 00:44:12,650
In the suburbs,
you like,

983
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:16,900
it snowed a foot and the fucking guy 
came by with the plow and he did it.

984
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:20,270
It's over.
It's over in the bigger cities,

985
00:44:20,271 --> 00:44:21,860
like it snows in three days,
you know,

986
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:25,280
fucking crazy shit isn't me.
Hearing about like the mountains getting

987
00:44:25,281 --> 00:44:30,281
like seven feet,
like every now and then they'll get a 

988
00:44:30,281 --> 00:44:31,090
snow dog,
but seven feet of snow will fall on the.

989
00:44:31,091 --> 00:44:32,370
I don't think people even understand

990
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:34,180
what the fuck that means.
I've prepared.

991
00:44:34,290 --> 00:44:38,310
If you're not going anywhere,
you're not going anywhere for a week.

992
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:40,080
At least.
I hit the.

993
00:44:40,081 --> 00:44:42,570
I hit the 1983.
If you could get a minute.

994
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:48,020
I hit the 1983 blizzard,
which was 24 days in a row of snow,

995
00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:53,580
anywhere from two inches to two feet,
but it didn't matter.

996
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:56,710
It didn't matter.
It was snow every day.

997
00:44:56,910 --> 00:44:59,220
So you pretty much went home and you 
know,

998
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:01,920
got up to Thanksgiving blizzard.
Oh Ha.

999
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:05,080
That's what Colorado is known for.
They say that Colorado gets blizzard.

1000
00:45:05,081 --> 00:45:07,800
It's always like around Thanksgiving or 
Halloween.

1001
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:10,440
One or the other.
The other one of the early.

1002
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,190
Just to remind you,
bitch put away the,

1003
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:15,150
you know what I'm saying?
Like don't get too comfortable with your

1004
00:45:15,151 --> 00:45:16,650
shorts and itchy.
Like in September,

1005
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:21,750
my sister was born in the blizzard of 
[inaudible] 78 in Ohio and they had to 

1006
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:24,711
take a helicopter,
had to go to my parents' house and pick 

1007
00:45:24,711 --> 00:45:28,431
her up my mom up to have to really.
Holy Shit.

1008
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:30,730
How much was that fucking helicopter 
ride?

1009
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:37,310
One of the biggest snow storms to ever 
hit a major city in the u.

1010
00:45:37,370 --> 00:45:39,480
The thanksgiving blizzard.
Nineteen 83.

1011
00:45:39,650 --> 00:45:40,620
Cairo.
Yeah.

1012
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:45,740
Particular Blizzard just wanted a whole 
series of storms and blew through the 

1013
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:49,491
country over a two week period.
So something happened in like a weather 

1014
00:45:49,491 --> 00:45:50,940
pattern got stuck over there or 
something.

1015
00:45:50,970 --> 00:45:53,640
Oh,
it was it Joe Rogan and it wasn't.

1016
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:57,120
I remember looking at the sky,
how the sky looked like.

1017
00:45:57,121 --> 00:45:59,430
You could still see the moon and the 
fucking morning,

1018
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:05,090
like at five in the morning and you 
could still see the moon and the sun's 

1019
00:46:05,090 --> 00:46:07,120
coming out the same time with that haze.
It's just fucking beautiful mountain.

1020
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,770
How long did it take before people could
move around?

1021
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,140
Twenty minutes.
No,

1022
00:46:13,141 --> 00:46:13,500
no,
no,

1023
00:46:13,501 --> 00:46:14,520
no.
After the blizzard.

1024
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:17,820
Like how long before people could drive 
around 20 minutes.

1025
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:18,990
No,
come on Bro.

1026
00:46:18,991 --> 00:46:20,370
It's Colorado,
you know,

1027
00:46:20,371 --> 00:46:21,510
seven feet of snow.

1028
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:22,580
How the fuck?
Oh,

1029
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:23,580
you know,
I mean it's,

1030
00:46:23,581 --> 00:46:25,470
it's snowing and people live in their 
life.

1031
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:30,500
You know what I'm saying?
They're just known and it's adding up 

1032
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:30,500
and you're still living your life.
You're like,

1033
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:34,551
well,
we've got a foot of snow and sudden you 

1034
00:46:34,551 --> 00:46:34,551
go in,
you look out at midnight,

1035
00:46:34,551 --> 00:46:34,551
honey,
I got to put my shoes on.

1036
00:46:34,551 --> 00:46:35,880
I had to go back out there and shovel.
And you know,

1037
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,000
it was one of those that I've read that 
they've gotten seven feet of snow in 

1038
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,271
some areas,
but my brain won't let me believe that 

1039
00:46:44,271 --> 00:46:44,850
my brain,
my brain is going shut up.

1040
00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:46,550
That's over a car.
Well,

1041
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:49,440
that's seven fucking feet.
Seven feet of snow.

1042
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:53,730
It's not real.
That's fun.

1043
00:46:53,731 --> 00:46:57,030
Is the most the deepest snow that has 
ever been recorded?

1044
00:46:57,570 --> 00:47:00,630
Like the deepest snow for.
Let's find out what is the deepest.

1045
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:05,720
I don't think it's here either.
Would you think might be in the United 

1046
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:08,720
States?
The most amount of snowfall in the 

1047
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:08,720
morning?
Yeah.

1048
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:08,910
I don't think it would be in the United 
States somewhere.

1049
00:47:09,450 --> 00:47:12,630
What's the deepest snow fall in the 
United States?

1050
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:16,260
Oh Shit.
It's a race between typing 19,

1051
00:47:16,261 --> 00:47:17,520
93.
Storm of the century.

1052
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:22,620
The total snowfall.
Twelve feet.

1053
00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:24,100
Oh my God.
What?

1054
00:47:24,330 --> 00:47:26,070
Twelve point nine slash 10 feet.
Hold on.

1055
00:47:26,071 --> 00:47:29,760
It's like a storm of the century.
90 three superstar.

1056
00:47:29,790 --> 00:47:30,010
But the

1057
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:31,270
buzzard,
1993,

1058
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:34,280
the east coast,
North America,

1059
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:34,700
blah,
blah,

1060
00:47:34,701 --> 00:47:35,810
blah blah blah,

1061
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:37,770
uh,

1062
00:47:37,870 --> 00:47:39,340
killed.
Three hundred and 10 people.

1063
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:51,480
What is the most snow and a storm ever 
bought whole?

1064
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:56,550
I loved the navy.
Threes is Christ snowdrifts are as high 

1065
00:47:56,550 --> 00:47:57,280
as 35 fee and that's a drift.

1066
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:02,400
You see some wild shit living up there 
and spin off a Ajax.

1067
00:48:02,401 --> 00:48:06,240
You see some fucking drips.
You know I'm going to Riverton,

1068
00:48:06,241 --> 00:48:11,241
Wyoming and all that.
Like my buddies used to jump off a 

1069
00:48:11,241 --> 00:48:13,851
helicopter and land in the snow and 
they'd say that it had to be 20 feet of 

1070
00:48:13,851 --> 00:48:17,811
fucking snow onto them.
You imagine that just jumping on a 

1071
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:17,970
helicopter 20 feet and landing.
It's snowy.

1072
00:48:18,050 --> 00:48:20,710
Oppose that James Bond Shit.
That's crazy.

1073
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:24,210
Crazy shit.
Take you up there with.

1074
00:48:24,390 --> 00:48:25,590
There's no lifts.
There's no.

1075
00:48:26,410 --> 00:48:27,250
Oh my God.
Yes.

1076
00:48:28,170 --> 00:48:31,080
And you just go down and you don't know 
what time do you those videos,

1077
00:48:31,081 --> 00:48:32,280
whatever.
I watched those videos,

1078
00:48:32,281 --> 00:48:37,281
those extreme sports videos of guys 
jumping out of helicopters are the 

1079
00:48:37,281 --> 00:48:38,280
fucking snowboard and going down the 
side of a mountain that's minus won't be

1080
00:48:38,281 --> 00:48:40,990
taken place on Avatar.
There might be this,

1081
00:48:41,130 --> 00:48:43,650
you might as well be doing some silver 
surfer shit.

1082
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:48,960
You know,
I can't even believe I'm sharing the 

1083
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:48,960
planet with you like you're a crazy 
person.

1084
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,230
You're doing like you're.
You live in the nuttiest suicide like,

1085
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:56,380
oh,
I'm just having a massive confidence in 

1086
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:59,030
their ability to surf and ski and I 
guess the rush of it is so spectacular.

1087
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:00,510
They're willing to take the risk of 
dying.

1088
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:02,070
People die all the time.
People just.

1089
00:49:02,071 --> 00:49:05,030
Somebody just died the other day.
Girl.

1090
00:49:05,031 --> 00:49:05,820
Yeah,
she,

1091
00:49:05,821 --> 00:49:07,920
I think she was doing some crazy sort of
a jump though.

1092
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:08,850
Our.
Yeah,

1093
00:49:08,910 --> 00:49:12,900
those are really dangerous men.
If you're fucking ski jumping,

1094
00:49:12,901 --> 00:49:15,700
you're flying through the air and you're
hoping you're going to land perfectly on

1095
00:49:15,701 --> 00:49:17,940
this fucking slope and everything's all 
slippery.

1096
00:49:17,970 --> 00:49:22,970
Like Valentines,
we can ask when I was telling you that 

1097
00:49:22,970 --> 00:49:23,690
that's one of the lower,
the lowest point of moistures India,

1098
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:26,610
so people ski with Bikini's on February.

1099
00:49:27,150 --> 00:49:30,270
What they do is they build a ramp and 
snowmass village.

1100
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:35,540
People ski down with Bikinis and do a 
loop de loop over a fucking pool 

1101
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:38,130
swimming pool and people do it all the 
time and you're like,

1102
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:40,950
oh my God.
Like I couldn't have.

1103
00:49:40,951 --> 00:49:43,190
Even I,
I was just happy skin going,

1104
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:48,230
you know,
I'm like a green fucking blow up or 

1105
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:50,541
something.
I was just happy not jumping and shit 

1106
00:49:50,541 --> 00:49:52,971
like that,
but sometimes I would ski and pick up 

1107
00:49:52,971 --> 00:49:52,971
momentum and I just crashed just to stop
Joe Rogan.

1108
00:49:52,971 --> 00:49:54,570
That's how fast you go on those fucking 
skis.

1109
00:49:54,571 --> 00:49:56,760
I'm telling you the truth.
I'm telling you the truth.

1110
00:49:56,761 --> 00:49:58,110
I don't give a fuck what anybody tells 
you.

1111
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:00,150
When I first started skiing the first 
season,

1112
00:50:00,151 --> 00:50:05,151
I wasn't too good at stopping.
I always do the plows and I would just 

1113
00:50:05,151 --> 00:50:08,931
take our fucking ski lines.
I would just take him to fuck off 

1114
00:50:08,931 --> 00:50:08,931
because I had no choice.

1115
00:50:08,931 --> 00:50:09,690
I would just put my head down and go in 
there like,

1116
00:50:09,691 --> 00:50:11,460
fuck jerome bettis.
People get hurt.

1117
00:50:11,461 --> 00:50:15,320
That wouldn't hurt.
And that's tornado season.

1118
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:19,500
My second season I started planning a 
little better and I got better,

1119
00:50:19,501 --> 00:50:24,501
but this time.
So you pick them up some speed and 

1120
00:50:24,501 --> 00:50:24,501
you're like,
Whoa,

1121
00:50:24,501 --> 00:50:24,501
wait a second.
Let's.

1122
00:50:24,501 --> 00:50:26,670
I would just fall.
Remember when it killed Sonny Bono,

1123
00:50:26,671 --> 00:50:27,190
man?
Yeah.

1124
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,940
That was a fucking tree that.
That's.

1125
00:50:29,590 --> 00:50:31,040
That happens.
That happens.

1126
00:50:31,041 --> 00:50:32,570
You just gained.
You hit something.

1127
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:35,040
You Ski,
twist to the jungle one.

1128
00:50:35,050 --> 00:50:38,510
Oh Damn.
That's how you come up with the skill.

1129
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:41,840
That was when I learned about coolness.
Does anybody ski with a helmet on?

1130
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:43,710
I would.
What'd you?

1131
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:48,760
Yeah.
I mean I used to ski with like a big 

1132
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:49,160
Michelin man out,
big nerf outfit.

1133
00:50:49,610 --> 00:50:51,350
Like that's when I learned about 
coolness.

1134
00:50:51,351 --> 00:50:54,620
I taught coolness was being in New York 
in the village and smoking a joint.

1135
00:50:54,770 --> 00:50:55,300
No,
no,

1136
00:50:55,301 --> 00:50:55,670
no,
no.

1137
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:58,900
When you go skiing and you get in that 
fucking gambling,

1138
00:50:58,910 --> 00:51:03,910
there's six people and they looked like 
your grandpa and all of a sudden 

1139
00:51:03,910 --> 00:51:04,490
somebody comes over and goes,
do you mind if for a spark up a joint?

1140
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:10,000
And you're like,
are you fucking so really the spark of 

1141
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,480
the Gondolas give you mushrooms are 
joints.

1142
00:51:11,481 --> 00:51:14,840
You don't know who you.
People go skiing to the doctors and go,

1143
00:51:14,841 --> 00:51:16,760
look,
we can't get high in Minneapolis,

1144
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:22,150
but we're going to get high and we go to
ask me will try and it would do and it 

1145
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:22,240
was doing mushrooms.
I spent as a kind of a crazy town.

1146
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:27,560
It's very,
it's weird that there's so many rich 

1147
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:28,550
people that live in Aspen.
Like I remember being in Aspen going,

1148
00:51:28,551 --> 00:51:32,630
how are they affording all these houses?
Like these are just gigantic,

1149
00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:34,280
multi,
multi,

1150
00:51:34,281 --> 00:51:39,281
multimillion dollar houses all over the 
place and the stores are all at the 

1151
00:51:39,281 --> 00:51:39,281
highest end stores.

1152
00:51:39,281 --> 00:51:40,880
How many people actually live up there 
though?

1153
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:44,420
It all winter.
It's mostly winter.

1154
00:51:44,421 --> 00:51:49,421
A lot.
The summer's a fucking beautiful and 

1155
00:51:49,421 --> 00:51:49,760
aspen and you got to remember,
this is the sick thing about aspen.

1156
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:54,230
Visa are their second homes.
These are their winter homes.

1157
00:51:54,530 --> 00:51:58,070
They close them up and put a.
The Guy I house sat for,

1158
00:51:58,071 --> 00:52:03,071
it was the owner of the.
He was on the board of Tgi Friday and 

1159
00:52:03,071 --> 00:52:06,110
this was one of his eight houses and he 
would only use it one week a year.

1160
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:08,540
Jesus.
And he wanted you to live in the house.

1161
00:52:08,541 --> 00:52:11,560
So when he came to town there was no 
dilemmas guide.

1162
00:52:11,570 --> 00:52:16,570
Four bedrooms.
I undo the speedometer on his fucking 

1163
00:52:16,570 --> 00:52:17,510
jeep.
I was living in Montana.

1164
00:52:17,511 --> 00:52:19,250
I Jacuzzi inside,
outside.

1165
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:21,800
He had an apartment over the garage.
That's common,

1166
00:52:21,801 --> 00:52:22,820
right?
That people hire a coach,

1167
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:26,120
hire a caretaker,
and all my job was 20 hours a month,

1168
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:31,420
so it was either 20 hours of mowing the 
lawn or 20 hours of shoveling snow or 

1169
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:32,690
both 20 and it was,
that's it.

1170
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:35,990
I wasn't much and so what he would just 
call you when he's coming into town,

1171
00:52:35,991 --> 00:52:40,991
you will call me and say I'm coming in 
December 14th to the 28th and you would 

1172
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:44,171
just start cleaning it up and I would 
clean up my side of the house and I had 

1173
00:52:44,171 --> 00:52:45,470
everything stashed and says his side of 
the house.

1174
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:49,040
I had an office and inside of the House 
and scales up there,

1175
00:52:49,041 --> 00:52:50,360
I had everything.
Really?

1176
00:52:50,361 --> 00:52:51,470
Yeah.
He had one,

1177
00:52:51,471 --> 00:52:52,420
two,
three,

1178
00:52:52,730 --> 00:52:55,880
five bedrooms and outside Jacuzzi inside
Jacuzzi.

1179
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:57,380
And he had.
So even when he was there,

1180
00:52:57,381 --> 00:52:59,900
you were still staying there?
I would stay in the garage over the.

1181
00:52:59,901 --> 00:53:02,480
He had an apartment he built that was 
beautiful cable.

1182
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:07,720
Everything at so I would stay there and 
then when he only for that one week and 

1183
00:53:07,821 --> 00:53:11,300
then I was only a cat take off in his 
bed,

1184
00:53:11,770 --> 00:53:13,150
I'd fucked up.

1185
00:53:13,570 --> 00:53:15,200
I've done everything in this fucking 
house.

1186
00:53:15,201 --> 00:53:18,590
I had the keys to the cabinets because 
what you do is you put all your stuff in

1187
00:53:18,591 --> 00:53:23,591
a particular cabinet and lock it.
So if you rent it out of your friends 

1188
00:53:23,591 --> 00:53:23,591
come to visit,
they don't find what your shit.

1189
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:24,710
Right.
That's what you do.

1190
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:30,110
So.
But I had the keys to that so I'd make 

1191
00:53:30,110 --> 00:53:31,911
my fucking.
He had pounds of elk and venison up 

1192
00:53:31,911 --> 00:53:31,911
there.
Really,

1193
00:53:31,911 --> 00:53:35,920
you know,
he was a hunter up there so it was an 

1194
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:35,970
amazing fucking gate.
But that was part of his thing.

1195
00:53:36,330 --> 00:53:38,940
Use everything,
use everything.

1196
00:53:38,941 --> 00:53:40,560
I don't want to come to town and have 
to,

1197
00:53:40,970 --> 00:53:45,970
you know,
I don't want the sink to be broken 

1198
00:53:45,970 --> 00:53:45,970
because your trees.
Right,

1199
00:53:45,970 --> 00:53:45,970
right,
right.

1200
00:53:45,970 --> 00:53:47,280
He's like I need you in the house taking
a shower.

1201
00:53:47,281 --> 00:53:47,940
And he got,
you know,

1202
00:53:47,941 --> 00:53:50,070
at that time it was stated a fucking out
the house.

1203
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:55,400
Yeah.
You have to live in it for 35 fall way 

1204
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:58,701
road.
I snorted more fucking blow and eight 

1205
00:53:58,701 --> 00:54:00,000
more snatching that fucking house and I 
seen some creepy.

1206
00:54:00,730 --> 00:54:04,250
I never been in there with a couple one 
night and I like,

1207
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:09,320
I met them at the bar,
like I knew her from the cheesecake and 

1208
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:09,770
they have the cheesecake store.
There wasn't a cheesecake factory.

1209
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:12,570
It was 1984 and I invited them over and,
and,

1210
00:54:12,590 --> 00:54:16,740
and I went to change and she was naked 
and I was like,

1211
00:54:16,741 --> 00:54:17,610
what the fuck is.
She goes,

1212
00:54:17,611 --> 00:54:18,510
what are you thinking?
My tits.

1213
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:23,760
I remember we all went back into the 
Jacuzzi and then at like five in the 

1214
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:24,120
morning,
he was a baker at a poll of fronts.

1215
00:54:24,270 --> 00:54:26,490
I don't know if they're still there and 
he left.

1216
00:54:26,850 --> 00:54:28,980
They both left and then she called me 
and said,

1217
00:54:28,981 --> 00:54:29,460
come get me.

1218
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:30,510
And I went over,
picked her up,

1219
00:54:30,511 --> 00:54:33,850
brought her back to the Jacuzzi.
I had the weirdest fucking things happen

1220
00:54:33,851 --> 00:54:36,240
in Aspen.
The weirdest sex things.

1221
00:54:36,570 --> 00:54:39,300
That's a crazy fucking town because it's
like anywhere else.

1222
00:54:39,301 --> 00:54:42,180
When people come up there for a week,
they want to fucking suck.

1223
00:54:42,690 --> 00:54:47,690
You know?
People want to get lost and the people 

1224
00:54:47,690 --> 00:54:47,690
that would kill up there were people 
from Texas.

1225
00:54:47,730 --> 00:54:52,590
I will spend millions up there.
I went to one of those bars,

1226
00:54:52,591 --> 00:54:55,390
one of the local bars with one of the 
agents when we had the,

1227
00:54:55,540 --> 00:55:00,540
the Aspen comedy festival.
I remember that when they hit the Hbo 

1228
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:00,540
Festival.
And uh,

1229
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:02,670
I was with his agent and he goes,
you see these girls?

1230
00:55:02,730 --> 00:55:03,900
See that girl,
that girl,

1231
00:55:03,901 --> 00:55:04,800
that girl?
I go,

1232
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:05,580
yeah,
he goes,

1233
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,890
those are all hookers,
thousand and nine.

1234
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:09,500
I was like,
what thousand dollars?

1235
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:14,560
They just go to bars and like they just 
wait and they're hookers like they come 

1236
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:14,580
into town.

1237
00:55:14,610 --> 00:55:17,310
Apparently he was saying that some of 
them know,

1238
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:20,430
like when during ski season that there's
a lot of wealthy men,

1239
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:21,930
thousand and nine.
That's incredible.

1240
00:55:21,931 --> 00:55:26,370
So they come in and they like hunt and 
this is their hunting ground.

1241
00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:32,150
That's amazing.
They got a job on the lift to the 

1242
00:55:32,150 --> 00:55:32,150
immediate sugar daddy and then it's all 
low really?

1243
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:34,890
Or they just go up there to hookup and 
Aspen.

1244
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:36,540
It's amazing.
It's amazing.

1245
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:41,750
It's amazing.
There's so much dough up and there's so 

1246
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:44,601
many crazy.
I remember going up there when I talked 

1247
00:55:44,601 --> 00:55:46,940
to get there,
I left and I left New York City and the 

1248
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:46,940
peak of New York City and I went to 
Aspen.

1249
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:51,920
They weren't missing a beat.
There was a bar named Patty bugattis 

1250
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:55,221
that had a swimming pool in the middle,
was hard with the swim right in the 

1251
00:55:55,221 --> 00:55:56,430
middle.
That's awesome.

1252
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:57,890
So you could swim while you were 
drinking.

1253
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:00,080
Get coked up people and they with their 
clothes.

1254
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:02,370
Makeup.
This was asking in 83.

1255
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:07,580
[inaudible] 83.
I asked him was the cocaine capital of 

1256
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:08,400
the country because there was so much 
money up.

1257
00:56:08,410 --> 00:56:13,380
That's where Miami vice was in Glen Fry 
and you creek and Sidney Poitier.

1258
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:15,720
Michael Douglas.
You just seen people come in.

1259
00:56:15,990 --> 00:56:17,560
Elizabeth Tale.
I seen a.

1260
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:20,550
what's the name once the flying nun,
that bad ass bitch.

1261
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:23,320
That chick that was hanging out with 
burt reynolds for awhile.

1262
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:24,220
Oh,
sally.

1263
00:56:24,510 --> 00:56:26,200
Sally,
finance bitch.

1264
00:56:26,201 --> 00:56:28,270
At that time with her brown and a 
metcon,

1265
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:31,300
Charles Bronson was up there running 
shit for awhile.

1266
00:56:31,510 --> 00:56:36,510
When I first moved to Aspen,
they had Katie la was only one channel 

1267
00:56:36,510 --> 00:56:37,360
and all they did was play Mr.
Majestic,

1268
00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:42,630
isn't it hard to get into aspen though?
Like the flying isn't a difficult 

1269
00:56:42,630 --> 00:56:46,561
flight.
Well they don't land in there at night 

1270
00:56:46,561 --> 00:56:46,561
after 8:00
or something.

1271
00:56:46,561 --> 00:56:50,311
They got strict rules.
But now you could fly to aspen from la 

1272
00:56:50,311 --> 00:56:53,431
direct real.
In the old days it was just Denver and 

1273
00:56:53,431 --> 00:56:53,560
Colorado Springs or not.
And if you,

1274
00:56:53,570 --> 00:56:58,570
like I told you,
if you fly into aspen as you're flying 

1275
00:56:58,570 --> 00:57:01,501
over woody creek,
there's a guy that dumped his wife that 

1276
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:02,980
was a stewardess.
So he painted a finger on his roof.

1277
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:07,270
So when you fly over asking the daytime,
there's always a roof the fucking finger

1278
00:57:07,271 --> 00:57:10,600
on it because his wife was a stewardess 
for one of the airlines.

1279
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:15,160
Woody creek is a very.
I seen,

1280
00:57:15,161 --> 00:57:18,280
I remember being a kid and a Conoco on,
at the,

1281
00:57:18,281 --> 00:57:20,090
uh,
old snowmass border.

1282
00:57:20,091 --> 00:57:25,091
There was a conical that the guys were 
from New York and when you went into 

1283
00:57:25,091 --> 00:57:27,931
that New York time and Colorado time.
But I know that seeing Kurt Ruffling 

1284
00:57:27,931 --> 00:57:30,130
Goldie Hawn with those fucking kids 
being kids,

1285
00:57:30,630 --> 00:57:35,630
like I didn't know.
I didn't know she was the girl from 

1286
00:57:35,630 --> 00:57:37,891
fucking.
I didn't know she was going to be a 

1287
00:57:37,891 --> 00:57:39,391
star.
There were kids at Conoco and that 

1288
00:57:39,391 --> 00:57:41,230
Conoco see at that time in Colorado it 
was all retired drug dealers.

1289
00:57:41,830 --> 00:57:45,100
Right.
So the feds were up there big time.

1290
00:57:45,310 --> 00:57:50,310
So in old snowmass they had this drug 
dealer so the feds fucking put cameras 

1291
00:57:50,310 --> 00:57:55,201
around his house,
but they didn't know how to do with 

1292
00:57:55,201 --> 00:57:55,201
that.
So it came up on people's Cable TV.

1293
00:57:55,201 --> 00:57:57,100
So people on cable going,
hey bro,

1294
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,710
you're on Channel Four,
you know you're cooking eggs,

1295
00:57:59,711 --> 00:58:00,010
aren't you?

1296
00:58:00,010 --> 00:58:00,970
And he's like,
how do you know?

1297
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:03,250
He sued the government.
Wow.

1298
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:08,340
Full fucking millions for an.
I mean Aspen's got some wild fucking 

1299
00:58:08,531 --> 00:58:09,940
shit.
There's a guy look him up,

1300
00:58:09,941 --> 00:58:13,780
Steven Gray Ball,
he got caught with $8,000,000.

1301
00:58:13,781 --> 00:58:17,050
Joe Rogan,
December of 83,

1302
00:58:17,770 --> 00:58:21,370
December of 84.
He was 30 days away from staying,

1303
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:26,400
standing drop and they blew them up with
a pipe bomb at the Aspen club when he 

1304
00:58:26,621 --> 00:58:31,621
was working out.
And that was the only night he didn't 

1305
00:58:31,621 --> 00:58:31,621
pay somebody that started his fucking 
car.

1306
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:35,620
They blew them up with a fucking pipe 
bomb in the city of Aspen.

1307
00:58:35,950 --> 00:58:40,950
Which an 83,
there wasn't even a fucking Spanish 

1308
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:40,950
person up there.
It was just nice white people.

1309
00:58:41,710 --> 00:58:45,160
Jesus Christ,
his first sentence,

1310
00:58:45,430 --> 00:58:47,890
despite its reputation as a city that 
never sleeps,

1311
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:50,740
thanks to the copious consumption of 
chemical stimulants,

1312
00:58:50,890 --> 00:58:54,550
aspen has seen relatively few large 
scale drug busts.

1313
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:58,450
Wow.
So they're just doing drugs up in Aspen.

1314
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:01,450
This is a fucking terrible comments.
You come in with the government,

1315
00:59:01,451 --> 00:59:05,230
you come and listen to fucking jail and 
aspen don't got a kitchen.

1316
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:08,830
That's the only on the country that 
don't have a kitchen.

1317
00:59:08,831 --> 00:59:13,831
They get that food catered.
So you get muffins for breakfast and tea

1318
00:59:14,081 --> 00:59:15,010
and really?
Yeah.

1319
00:59:15,011 --> 00:59:20,011
That's why bundy escaped from there.
How do you think these people fucking 

1320
00:59:20,011 --> 00:59:20,011
escape from there?
What?

1321
00:59:20,011 --> 00:59:22,160
They use the phone and climbed the 
fucking window.

1322
00:59:22,490 --> 00:59:23,450
Aspen,
Colorado.

1323
00:59:23,451 --> 00:59:28,451
When I was there,
some guy shot a guy with a machine gun 

1324
00:59:28,451 --> 00:59:28,451
and a coke party shot.
I'm going to machine gun.

1325
00:59:28,451 --> 00:59:33,071
They had the guy fishing.
They take good a fishing trips in the 

1326
00:59:33,071 --> 00:59:33,650
summer down there.
Fucking roaring fork thing.

1327
00:59:33,651 --> 00:59:35,610
They take your fish and they take the 
prisoners.

1328
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:40,660
I went to prison.
The biggest thing I wanted to go to the 

1329
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:40,970
rifle because they gave you a job as a 
lifeguard in the city,

1330
00:59:42,530 --> 00:59:45,290
so they use the prisoners,
is lifeguards and they gave you a job in

1331
00:59:45,291 --> 00:59:46,550
the movie theater in rifle.

1332
00:59:46,730 --> 00:59:49,250
I ended up at Camp George West,
but I really wanted to go to rifle,

1333
00:59:49,251 --> 00:59:50,890
which is on the other side of the hill.
Asman.

1334
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:56,260
It's like an hour for Massman,
but in the wintertime they had worked 

1335
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:56,720
for because you took over the city that 
prisoners,

1336
00:59:57,410 --> 01:00:00,740
but it's fucking aspen has no fucking 
kitchen,

1337
01:00:00,741 --> 01:00:02,620
my friend.
That's ridiculous.

1338
01:00:02,621 --> 01:00:04,610
And they still get food catered for 
them.

1339
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:07,820
What is there like a lot of shit out 
there though.

1340
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:12,880
It just.
This is sort of when I give you that 

1341
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:12,880
fact is people twitted me right now 
going,

1342
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:13,250
Joe,
you an asshole.

1343
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:18,520
I'm telling you in 1983,
if you look at Colorado was the cocaine 

1344
01:00:19,341 --> 01:00:24,341
capital of the country because 
Colorado's right in the middle of the 

1345
01:00:24,341 --> 01:00:24,341
country.
At that time,

1346
01:00:24,341 --> 01:00:24,920
Mexico,
we weren't using Mexico,

1347
01:00:25,070 --> 01:00:30,070
so it was Miami and everything got 
shipped to Colorado and from Colorado 

1348
01:00:30,070 --> 01:00:30,320
went to Minneapolis,
Seattle,

1349
01:00:30,321 --> 01:00:31,430
California,
blah,

1350
01:00:31,431 --> 01:00:31,970
blah,
blah.

1351
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:33,920
Everybody's waiting for something in 
California.

1352
01:00:33,950 --> 01:00:36,230
Everybody's waiting for you.
In California and Colorado.

1353
01:00:36,231 --> 01:00:41,231
It's a bunch of fucking guys.
Would horses at the airport helping you 

1354
01:00:41,231 --> 01:00:41,570
carry the coconut to the plane?
Can I help you with that?

1355
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:46,780
They're helping you.
It's a very mystique type of fucking 

1356
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:46,820
city.
At the top of this.

1357
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:49,070
It's Glenwood Springs.
Snowmass village.

1358
01:00:49,071 --> 01:00:51,830
Woody Creek and asked and sits on the 
fucking top.

1359
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:53,450
Dude.
This is the whole story.

1360
01:00:53,510 --> 01:00:55,390
Nineteen eight.
The grable case.

1361
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:57,160
They were.
Yeah.

1362
01:00:57,161 --> 01:01:02,161
They didn't tell us about how he was 
blown up and above a bomb placed in a 

1363
01:01:02,161 --> 01:01:03,460
borrowed car that he drove to the Aspen 
Club for a tennis.

1364
01:01:03,470 --> 01:01:04,880
What the fuck you think you're dealing 
with here?

1365
01:01:04,881 --> 01:01:05,570
Joy.
Bananas.

1366
01:01:05,571 --> 01:01:10,571
I'll drop it on and if and if I'm right,
it was December twelfth or December 

1367
01:01:10,571 --> 01:01:10,730
something.
December 1980.

1368
01:01:11,150 --> 01:01:16,150
Fuck you think you're dealing with it?
A bomb in a borrowed car as he drove to 

1369
01:01:16,150 --> 01:01:18,290
the Aspen Club for a tennis match.

1370
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:20,600
Could you imagine all this fucking Aspen
Heights,

1371
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:25,610
but listen to me showing up at their 
tennis outfits on and Mercedes and 

1372
01:01:25,610 --> 01:01:27,890
pulling into the driveway and his 
fucking car blows up.

1373
01:01:27,891 --> 01:01:32,891
I listened to these numbers.
He was making $6 million every six 

1374
01:01:32,891 --> 01:01:36,971
weeks.
After two or three years he was making 

1375
01:01:36,971 --> 01:01:37,850
so much money.
He was a Jewish kid that went to Miami,

1376
01:01:38,010 --> 01:01:43,010
University of Miami to get a degree and 
ended up hanging out with Cubans and 

1377
01:01:43,010 --> 01:01:43,940
Colombians and that was it.
They made him a white guy.

1378
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:46,070
They just said,
you're going to control the west coast.

1379
01:01:46,490 --> 01:01:48,650
And he was making 6 million every six 
weeks.

1380
01:01:49,070 --> 01:01:54,070
Couldn't even can cleanse it fast enough
so he would come into your restaurant 

1381
01:01:54,070 --> 01:01:54,070
and go,
Joe Rogan,

1382
01:01:54,070 --> 01:01:55,610
I'm going to give you 25,000
cash.

1383
01:01:55,970 --> 01:02:00,970
Call me when it's over.
So he would go to every restaurant in 

1384
01:02:00,970 --> 01:02:03,170
this area and give him 25 grand and go 
do me a favor.

1385
01:02:03,650 --> 01:02:08,650
Call me when it's over.
So I'm just going to come in and eat 

1386
01:02:08,650 --> 01:02:11,501
every day.
Just tell me when they're 25 grand and 

1387
01:02:11,501 --> 01:02:14,021
the quicker the better.
Like if I come in here for three 

1388
01:02:14,021 --> 01:02:14,021
hotdogs,
told me the 25 is gone,

1389
01:02:14,021 --> 01:02:16,040
you're doing me a favor.
So when they busted him,

1390
01:02:16,041 --> 01:02:19,440
they just didn't bust him.
If you read the story that went to these

1391
01:02:19,441 --> 01:02:24,441
businesses,
you know that there's a movie that they 

1392
01:02:24,441 --> 01:02:24,540
did years later.
That was his story where he had safe set

1393
01:02:24,541 --> 01:02:27,330
all the restaurants where you would come
to your restaurant.

1394
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:30,930
I'm going to give you 25 grand a month.
They usually tell me when it's over,

1395
01:02:30,931 --> 01:02:34,250
but I'm going to put a safe in the back.
And he started putting some.

1396
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:36,330
When the feds came up there,
they found a million,

1397
01:02:36,331 --> 01:02:37,420
2 million.
All these things.

1398
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:42,760
My come to Denver,
he couldn't even wash the money fast 

1399
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:42,760
enough.

1400
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:43,560
They took them to Denver and Denver.
The feds go,

1401
01:02:43,650 --> 01:02:47,670
go back to the fucking house because 
there's still another 10 million that we

1402
01:02:47,671 --> 01:02:49,260
haven't found.
We've been listening to him.

1403
01:02:50,010 --> 01:02:52,710
So they went back to the house,
couldn't find it,

1404
01:02:52,740 --> 01:02:55,500
couldn't find it.
He had hidden in a garbage can.

1405
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:58,680
Fill with leaves outside.
How the feds got them,

1406
01:02:58,681 --> 01:03:03,681
what they were gone and taken his 
garbage and they were looking at his 

1407
01:03:03,681 --> 01:03:05,970
paperwork so the feds will come every 
morning and take his garbage and look at

1408
01:03:05,971 --> 01:03:08,880
the figures he would do.
They did it from the scrapping.

1409
01:03:08,881 --> 01:03:12,030
So all the little figures you do a rip 
up that all that Shit.

1410
01:03:12,031 --> 01:03:15,780
That's how they nailed them.
So they waited a fucking year til he was

1411
01:03:15,810 --> 01:03:20,810
30 days away from sentencing in this 
beautiful white suburban town above 

1412
01:03:20,981 --> 01:03:22,110
Aspen,
Colorado.

1413
01:03:22,530 --> 01:03:26,190
And on a Sunday night they fucking blew 
him up in a rented car.

1414
01:03:26,190 --> 01:03:31,190
Why you waiting?
He had a borrowed car because at that 

1415
01:03:31,190 --> 01:03:33,440
point he had eight cars in his garage.
Like he had cars everywhere.

1416
01:03:33,450 --> 01:03:35,490
Couldn't trust any of them.
He couldn't trust any of them.

1417
01:03:35,491 --> 01:03:37,140
They knew.
He knew that the,

1418
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:37,640
the,
the,

1419
01:03:37,650 --> 01:03:40,260
the Colombians weren't going to take it 
whether he talked to not.

1420
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:42,300
Why take the chance we're going to kill 
him.

1421
01:03:42,540 --> 01:03:47,540
So he had bodyguards and I didn't.
He didn't know that they put a fucking 

1422
01:03:47,540 --> 01:03:47,970
pipe bomb on them.
That was Miami vice type shit.

1423
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:51,240
He went to Schottische car and he almost
lived.

1424
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:55,560
But the pipe went up through his fucking
ass and he almost bled to death.

1425
01:03:55,580 --> 01:03:55,980
Yeah.
Yeah.

1426
01:03:56,010 --> 01:03:58,320
The pipe bomb went through him or 
something.

1427
01:03:58,321 --> 01:04:00,570
Something weird.
He bled out or something.

1428
01:04:00,571 --> 01:04:02,690
He could have lived very interesting.
Aspen,

1429
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:05,310
Colorado.
Very interesting place.

1430
01:04:05,490 --> 01:04:07,950
Jesus Christ.
That's hilarious.

1431
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:09,030
Well,
whenever you have drugs,

1432
01:04:09,031 --> 01:04:09,840
you got to have violence.

1433
01:04:09,950 --> 01:04:14,950
Whenever you have people buying,
buying massive amounts of coke or 

1434
01:04:14,950 --> 01:04:15,150
whatever the fuck they is it coke up 
there.

1435
01:04:15,330 --> 01:04:17,850
This is where it gets better.
He never seen it.

1436
01:04:18,630 --> 01:04:20,850
What do you mean?
He moved so much blow.

1437
01:04:21,150 --> 01:04:23,370
He never even seen it.
He didn't see the glow.

1438
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:27,330
He would go to the bank and get $500 
worth of quarters a day.

1439
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:33,200
His whole day was just getting caught 
and they would drive three hours to a 

1440
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:33,780
payphone and do all his business from a 
payphone.

1441
01:04:34,290 --> 01:04:35,790
Really?
He never waited.

1442
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:37,500
He never seen it.
He never touched it.

1443
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:40,200
He just moved it.
Go to Minneapolis,

1444
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:42,060
go to la,
go to New Mexico.

1445
01:04:42,130 --> 01:04:45,090
Jesus is the center,
so he did it all from payphones,

1446
01:04:45,130 --> 01:04:47,760
everything.
Everything was from a payphone.

1447
01:04:47,790 --> 01:04:50,520
$500 a day and they were watching them 
at the bank.

1448
01:04:50,521 --> 01:04:52,590
They were watching them.
They will want,

1449
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:57,960
you know,
how big is asking you fight the whole 

1450
01:04:57,960 --> 01:04:57,990
fucking town from housing that's amid 
seven blocks or something.

1451
01:04:57,991 --> 01:05:00,210
They blocked Galena street.
Main Street.

1452
01:05:00,570 --> 01:05:05,570
You don't have much up there.
Are very big and he wasn't sanded up 

1453
01:05:05,570 --> 01:05:05,570
there.
It wasn't like he was at bars at night.

1454
01:05:05,570 --> 01:05:06,720
No,
the guy was just.

1455
01:05:07,050 --> 01:05:12,050
That's just where he was.
He was just moving it across the 

1456
01:05:12,050 --> 01:05:12,050
country.
Very interesting fucking story about.

1457
01:05:12,050 --> 01:05:14,280
That's a hell of a network you put 
together to be able to accomplish that.

1458
01:05:14,340 --> 01:05:16,500
One of the first guys ever Jewish guy.

1459
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:23,880
What would it be like of cocaine?
Was legal and knowing him knowing would 

1460
01:05:24,351 --> 01:05:29,351
have been super right.
I'm the only one here that hasn't done 

1461
01:05:29,351 --> 01:05:29,351
it very bad.
Very bad.

1462
01:05:29,351 --> 01:05:32,950
If they want to legalize that shit,
people go to pharmacies and shit.

1463
01:05:33,610 --> 01:05:34,450
It's just.
And it's.

1464
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:39,640
And it's a creepy thing when you're 
doing it and that's even creepier when 

1465
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:39,640
you're not doing it.
Yeah.

1466
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:40,450
You know when you see it now you're 
like,

1467
01:05:40,451 --> 01:05:42,680
wow,
is that how creepy guy was?

1468
01:05:42,780 --> 01:05:47,780
Obvious Rv,
somebody told me that the weed store 

1469
01:05:47,780 --> 01:05:50,791
that they went to a party yesterday and 
obviously the kitten didn't know it was 

1470
01:05:50,791 --> 01:05:52,450
not a cold party because they went to a 
football thing and the kid.

1471
01:05:52,451 --> 01:05:53,590
I'm like,
isn't that weird?

1472
01:05:53,591 --> 01:05:58,591
When one person is doing it,
they stick out that that's a weird 

1473
01:05:58,591 --> 01:05:59,020
feeling when you're talking to a dude in
there coked up and they had.

1474
01:05:59,020 --> 01:06:02,050
They give off that weird unpredictable 
energy like,

1475
01:06:02,550 --> 01:06:04,900
well I've got to get away from this guy.
I can't even read this motherfucker.

1476
01:06:04,901 --> 01:06:07,150
I don't know what he's doing and it's 
just they just,

1477
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:12,430
they come off off shifty looking around 
a lot and can't shut the fuck up.

1478
01:06:13,870 --> 01:06:15,670
Constantly yapping.
It's tough.

1479
01:06:15,710 --> 01:06:20,710
Fucking afternoon.
When you were talking about the largest 

1480
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:23,610
snowfall,
did you hear what the actual one is and 

1481
01:06:23,610 --> 01:06:25,960
this is ridiculous.
It's a hundred and 41 feet in more than 

1482
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:27,160
five days.
What?

1483
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:32,240
Where's this?
And it was in Alaska.

1484
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:36,040
Christ.
How's that?

1485
01:06:36,041 --> 01:06:41,041
Even possible.
So what happens that just like covers 

1486
01:06:41,041 --> 01:06:41,041
the house and that's it.
You Die,

1487
01:06:41,041 --> 01:06:45,140
you die because no left.
You're attracting like Tom and Jerry 

1488
01:06:45,140 --> 01:06:45,140
style where your windows shoveled out 
away quick enough.

1489
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:46,570
Yeah.
What happens?

1490
01:06:46,571 --> 01:06:47,490
You Die.
Yeah.

1491
01:06:47,491 --> 01:06:50,140
You pretty much lived off of whatever 
was in her house,

1492
01:06:50,141 --> 01:06:50,710
I guess.

1493
01:06:50,770 --> 01:06:55,770
Yeah,
but even then you don't have any air 

1494
01:06:55,770 --> 01:06:55,770
were where's your air coming in?
You've got to get air.

1495
01:06:55,770 --> 01:06:59,290
You have to make like a pipe using 
sticks and then all that snow melts.

1496
01:06:59,291 --> 01:07:01,960
It's going to be a fucking river that's 
going to wash your house away.

1497
01:07:01,990 --> 01:07:03,790
Yeah.
That's crazy.

1498
01:07:03,850 --> 01:07:08,850
Unless you start eating it.
Maybe it was in a really rural area 

1499
01:07:08,850 --> 01:07:12,571
where nobody lives.
Maybe that's why it's their subjects to 

1500
01:07:12,571 --> 01:07:15,271
such giant snow dumps and they just had 
20 feet like last week or so feet.

1501
01:07:18,550 --> 01:07:23,310
God Damn Jesus fucking Christ.
Yeah.

1502
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:26,470
There's some spots in this world that 
are really hazardous.

1503
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:29,470
You could deal with some shit.
That's the one thing.

1504
01:07:29,471 --> 01:07:31,000
You live in California for a little 
while.

1505
01:07:31,001 --> 01:07:36,001
People completely forget.
They completely forget that there's 

1506
01:07:36,001 --> 01:07:36,910
nature to consider like everybody's been
freaking out these last couple of days.

1507
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:42,120
The reason why this podcast started late
is because some truck flipped over on 

1508
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:44,220
the highway because nobody knows how to 
drive in the rain when it gets wet.

1509
01:07:45,050 --> 01:07:48,130
It's wet here and everybody just spazzes
out and on top of it,

1510
01:07:48,131 --> 01:07:51,970
the road is greasy as fuck because of 
the fact that it doesn't rain very often

1511
01:07:51,971 --> 01:07:56,971
when it does rain,
it brings up all that oil from people's 

1512
01:07:56,971 --> 01:07:59,350
cars and tires and all that and all the 
shit that's on the car that everyone has

1513
01:07:59,351 --> 01:08:01,810
dirty cars or have film on the car 
that's,

1514
01:08:01,811 --> 01:08:03,730
you know,
whatever rinses off as well.

1515
01:08:03,731 --> 01:08:08,731
Yeah.
Wax and all kinds of other gem 

1516
01:08:08,731 --> 01:08:08,731
challenged chem trails.
Uh,

1517
01:08:08,731 --> 01:08:10,030
but there were so,
so,

1518
01:08:10,090 --> 01:08:15,090
you know,
I saw God lose it last night and I was 

1519
01:08:15,090 --> 01:08:16,100
right behind him.
He's got the here at 4:15

1520
01:08:16,270 --> 01:08:20,960
and it's a 25 minute ride from my house.
I left at 3:00

1521
01:08:21,170 --> 01:08:24,200
on the clock as I was leaving and it was
slow the whole way.

1522
01:08:24,201 --> 01:08:25,980
And then as I got closer to seeing the 
helicopters,

1523
01:08:26,420 --> 01:08:28,490
helicopters don't show for a little 
accident.

1524
01:08:28,490 --> 01:08:31,690
They show for something heavy duty.
So it's a weird place.

1525
01:08:32,450 --> 01:08:37,450
There's too many of us men,
there's too many fucking people living 

1526
01:08:37,450 --> 01:08:37,790
in one place,
so all we need is one thing to go wrong.

1527
01:08:37,850 --> 01:08:38,450
I tell you,
man,

1528
01:08:38,451 --> 01:08:43,451
when I was in Ohio though,
I don't give a shit because right now 

1529
01:08:43,451 --> 01:08:46,241
it's going to be 90 degrees Thursday and
that that's worth it to me one way or 

1530
01:08:46,881 --> 01:08:47,810
here?
No,

1531
01:08:47,811 --> 01:08:50,120
here 90.
I'm fucking Thursday.

1532
01:08:50,510 --> 01:08:55,510
Yeah.
I like people on the east coast right 

1533
01:08:55,510 --> 01:08:55,510
now.
They call me and go,

1534
01:08:55,510 --> 01:08:55,850
you're 65 today.
Tomorrow Bitch.

1535
01:08:55,940 --> 01:09:00,940
February is next month.
Motherfucker call me February 15th when 

1536
01:09:00,940 --> 01:09:05,001
you fucking Bikini on February 15th.
Pocket comedy.

1537
01:09:05,091 --> 01:09:10,091
Valentine's Day.
It's definitely harder to live in a 

1538
01:09:10,091 --> 01:09:10,310
place like that.
It makes it just makes life harder.

1539
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:12,920
But Minneapolis this week,
he's crazy.

1540
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:14,900
He's going to that house and his 
gangster,

1541
01:09:14,901 --> 01:09:19,901
all that he's doing.
He's doing a fucking scavenger hunt in 

1542
01:09:19,901 --> 01:09:19,901
the mall with.

1543
01:09:19,901 --> 01:09:19,901
With,
with.

1544
01:09:19,901 --> 01:09:21,110
I'm going to get a little piece of 
banana.

1545
01:09:21,111 --> 01:09:22,130
Prayerful bump.
That shit.

1546
01:09:22,131 --> 01:09:24,200
I'm going to open it up.
They don't play.

1547
01:09:24,350 --> 01:09:26,690
They're not the same.
Minnesota.

1548
01:09:26,710 --> 01:09:28,760
They'll throw you in jail right next to 
Jesse.

1549
01:09:28,761 --> 01:09:32,830
Fucking Ventura.
Stop eating edibles because that fucking

1550
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:34,190
surgery.
Yeah,

1551
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:37,630
you have to stop eating it because it 
just dog.

1552
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:42,640
I got.
I fainted from reading the fucking 

1553
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:42,720
paperwork.
I fainted from reading.

1554
01:09:44,150 --> 01:09:46,500
We've discussed this before.
The needles or the blood.

1555
01:09:46,570 --> 01:09:48,440
Really?
I got to the fucking statured will.

1556
01:09:48,441 --> 01:09:52,430
The sutures will include sutures that 
he's going to put sutures in my knee.

1557
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:54,970
I fainted coming out from under my 
titties.

1558
01:09:55,230 --> 01:09:56,330
You know,
you got lucky.

1559
01:09:56,990 --> 01:09:57,950
So I said,
you know what?

1560
01:09:57,951 --> 01:10:01,070
I think I had an edible that day to last
week.

1561
01:10:01,071 --> 01:10:04,250
I smoked a little piece of hash and I 
read fucking.

1562
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:09,760
I went online just to prepare for 
surgery and I thought it would tell me 

1563
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:12,941
what vitamins to take and I'm reading 
about this arthroscopic surgery and I 

1564
01:10:12,941 --> 01:10:13,460
went fucking down on my fucking office.

1565
01:10:13,730 --> 01:10:15,740
What exactly are they saying is wrong 
with your knee?

1566
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:21,460
Meniscus tear,
a little bit of arthritis and a little 

1567
01:10:21,460 --> 01:10:21,580
system.
The meniscus tearing.

1568
01:10:22,850 --> 01:10:25,410
So they're going to extract the system.
Then they're going to clean up the Nunez

1569
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:26,560
case.
Yeah.

1570
01:10:26,590 --> 01:10:31,590
That's not too bad.
That's like six weeks and you're pretty 

1571
01:10:31,590 --> 01:10:31,590
close to 100 percent.
You know,

1572
01:10:31,590 --> 01:10:32,420
I uh,
I waited,

1573
01:10:32,630 --> 01:10:37,630
I waited six weeks,
last time I did that and then was 

1574
01:10:37,630 --> 01:10:40,781
training six weeks later by Google 
swimming right afterwards just to bike 

1575
01:10:40,781 --> 01:10:41,310
is really good.
Swimming is.

1576
01:10:41,450 --> 01:10:46,450
Swimming is decent cook too.
But what I like about a bike is that 

1577
01:10:46,450 --> 01:10:46,450
it's stationary,
it's constant.

1578
01:10:46,450 --> 01:10:48,890
You don't have to worry about side to 
side motion and you're just,

1579
01:10:48,891 --> 01:10:53,891
you can just do it at a light pace where
you're stimulating the tendons and the 

1580
01:10:53,891 --> 01:10:58,241
ligaments and the muscle tissue,
but you're not really taxing the knee 

1581
01:10:58,241 --> 01:10:58,250
now.
So you don't do it hard.

1582
01:10:58,280 --> 01:11:01,370
It's basically your five minutes.
Not even.

1583
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:02,480
Don't even start with dying,
man.

1584
01:11:02,490 --> 01:11:04,980
Start with.
I've been doing a 45 on our load now.

1585
01:11:05,020 --> 01:11:10,020
Oh,
before I'm just doing everything in 

1586
01:11:10,020 --> 01:11:10,020
order.
That's good.

1587
01:11:10,020 --> 01:11:11,150
You should get one of these.
What is fitbit?

1588
01:11:11,210 --> 01:11:13,550
You'll become addicted to it.
It attracted.

1589
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:14,040
We talked about

1590
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:16,980
this on the podcast today with most 
people will know though,

1591
01:11:16,981 --> 01:11:18,660
because we talked about it on the desk.
Squad one.

1592
01:11:18,670 --> 01:11:19,950
Oh yeah.
So what it is,

1593
01:11:19,951 --> 01:11:24,951
it's this thing that you clip on and it 
automatically tracks how many steps you 

1594
01:11:25,621 --> 01:11:27,360
make.
How many stairs you walk?

1595
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:28,650
Uh,
it tracks,

1596
01:11:28,651 --> 01:11:33,651
you know,
just like it's Bert Kreischer told us 

1597
01:11:33,651 --> 01:11:33,651
about it.
Right.

1598
01:11:33,651 --> 01:11:36,081
He was the one who,
he's the one that told us about it on 

1599
01:11:36,081 --> 01:11:37,881
the Ice House chronicles and uh,
so it's really neat is that it has like 

1600
01:11:37,881 --> 01:11:39,900
a thing in it that you could also wear 
when you sleep,

1601
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:45,080
so it detects whenever you wake up and 
so then it adds up how long you're 

1602
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:46,950
actually sleeping every night.
And you'll be surprised.

1603
01:11:46,951 --> 01:11:51,951
You think like,
oh I got like 10 hours sleep when in 

1604
01:11:51,951 --> 01:11:54,111
reality you didn't like half the time 
you were still awake or you would wake 

1605
01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:55,080
up and it's based on,
you know,

1606
01:11:55,090 --> 01:11:57,330
it detects like your heartbeat it 
detects,

1607
01:11:57,360 --> 01:12:00,330
has a gyro stick open it or whatever the
fuck it's called,

1608
01:12:00,331 --> 01:12:00,590
where.

1609
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:03,930
So it tells you,
it knows when you're walking and all the

1610
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:04,800
amazing.
Yeah.

1611
01:12:04,801 --> 01:12:09,801
And then wirelessly broadcasts to this 
website and it shows you in graphs like,

1612
01:12:09,930 --> 01:12:11,970
like how much you did and stuff.
And you try to,

1613
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:14,610
the more you use it,
the more you are like a game,

1614
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:16,770
you try to beat it.
It's like twitter addictive,

1615
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:21,800
like it's really interesting and I like 
I just became friends on Bruckner 

1616
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:25,091
Chrysler's a a thing that it's like 
having a new facebook where it just 

1617
01:12:25,091 --> 01:12:29,061
tracks your,
your shit every night and I just did 

1618
01:12:29,061 --> 01:12:29,061
like a big credible.
Yeah,

1619
01:12:29,061 --> 01:12:31,120
I did a little review it on that desk.
Squad dot TV and nurse links to buy.

1620
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:32,280
I'll tell you something,
bro.

1621
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:37,520
That new sleep apnea machine,
they gave me the other one fucked up 

1622
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:38,440
that time to give me a new one where I 
thought the old one was good.

1623
01:12:38,470 --> 01:12:40,900
This new one.
I can take the card out,

1624
01:12:41,050 --> 01:12:44,560
put it into my computer and I could tell
you what nights I drank alcohol.

1625
01:12:44,710 --> 01:12:49,710
I don't drink alcohol.
I can tell you that what nights I drank 

1626
01:12:49,710 --> 01:12:49,710
on because you can see it in your sleep 
pattern.

1627
01:12:49,750 --> 01:12:54,750
That's amazing.
I go from one to get one of these 

1628
01:12:54,750 --> 01:12:56,720
sessions and then the other thing it 
tells you I can even tell when I smoked 

1629
01:12:56,720 --> 01:12:58,510
a lot of weed that day.
What was the difference?

1630
01:13:00,370 --> 01:13:05,370
Really?
If I smoked too much weed and my wife 

1631
01:13:05,370 --> 01:13:05,370
will tell you,
you know you were snoring.

1632
01:13:05,370 --> 01:13:07,260
I went by ambulance at one and smoke 50 
fucking join.

1633
01:13:07,590 --> 01:13:10,670
That makes you snore more.
Something probably because you relaxed.

1634
01:13:11,690 --> 01:13:13,630
Good.
Yeah.

1635
01:13:13,660 --> 01:13:15,100
That's what it is.
You're probably out there.

1636
01:13:15,101 --> 01:13:20,101
Fucking cold.
Brian Red Band desk squad number six on 

1637
01:13:20,101 --> 01:13:20,980
the podcasts.
On itunes.

1638
01:13:20,981 --> 01:13:22,870
Right now.
Number six bitches.

1639
01:13:22,930 --> 01:13:25,310
That's pretty strong around guys.
Oh Shit.

1640
01:13:25,610 --> 01:13:29,860
What'd you just congratulate?
Reward as the Lincoln Dude.

1641
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:31,750
That's strong.
That's from the icehouse chronicles.

1642
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:34,810
Alan.
Also Brian Cowen show.

1643
01:13:34,811 --> 01:13:37,600
Now is it just going to call it the 
Brian counts gunshot,

1644
01:13:37,750 --> 01:13:39,000
which I like.
Which I liked too.

1645
01:13:39,370 --> 01:13:41,650
He doesn't even know the name.
He was trying to figure out if he should

1646
01:13:41,651 --> 01:13:42,550
have a theme,
but I'm like,

1647
01:13:42,551 --> 01:13:47,551
he's so interesting.
Why box yourself in that guy can just 

1648
01:13:47,551 --> 01:13:47,551
ramble on about anything.
You know,

1649
01:13:47,551 --> 01:13:49,840
he's,
he's one of my favorite dudes to talk to

1650
01:13:49,900 --> 01:13:52,420
and that podcast we had with Dane Cook.
That was amazing.

1651
01:13:52,510 --> 01:13:53,870
That was interesting.
And that dude,

1652
01:13:54,030 --> 01:13:57,130
Tj Miller apparently wants to talk to me
about it.

1653
01:13:57,130 --> 01:13:58,310
I would talk to them about it.
You know,

1654
01:13:58,320 --> 01:13:59,260
I,
I don't hate that dude.

1655
01:13:59,530 --> 01:14:00,700
I don't know.
I don't,

1656
01:14:00,740 --> 01:14:01,230
you know,
I,

1657
01:14:01,290 --> 01:14:06,290
I don't,
I don't think it's a good idea to go on 

1658
01:14:06,290 --> 01:14:09,211
long rants about people working out 
material that haven't been on stage for 

1659
01:14:09,211 --> 01:14:09,211
a year though.
I just,

1660
01:14:09,211 --> 01:14:11,470
that's just,
that's just how feel,

1661
01:14:11,890 --> 01:14:14,500
you know.
Joey,

1662
01:14:14,530 --> 01:14:19,530
what are you doing?
Just checking on something which is 

1663
01:14:19,530 --> 01:14:19,710
called listen,
I,

1664
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:21,020
I don't know what it was about.
I didn't,

1665
01:14:21,021 --> 01:14:26,021
I don't give a fuck if you don't know.
It's about everybody should bump Jane 

1666
01:14:26,700 --> 01:14:27,340
Cook,
bumped them,

1667
01:14:27,430 --> 01:14:32,430
dump,
bumped everybody at the laugh factory 

1668
01:14:32,430 --> 01:14:32,830
which happens on stage and while it does
happen all the time,

1669
01:14:32,860 --> 01:14:34,740
you know,
but what I said to Dan really does stand

1670
01:14:34,741 --> 01:14:39,741
true.
Like really he doesn't have to do that 

1671
01:14:39,741 --> 01:14:40,120
and it's a strong move to just come on 
after everybody.

1672
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:45,100
It's a strong move to like let everybody
else go on stage and then you go on last

1673
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:46,000
man,
you're the big star.

1674
01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:51,060
I agree.
And like tell everybody like let them 

1675
01:14:51,060 --> 01:14:51,060
know,
hey Dane Cook is going to be on later.

1676
01:14:51,060 --> 01:14:52,460
Yay.
So then these guys do their time.

1677
01:14:52,900 --> 01:14:53,520
They will get.
Wait,

1678
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:55,510
it ain't that hard man.
It ain't that hard to wait.

1679
01:14:55,511 --> 01:14:58,570
But it's a thing that we had to 
experience where we're coming up.

1680
01:14:58,820 --> 01:15:00,220
Uh,
it was a constant thing.

1681
01:15:00,221 --> 01:15:05,221
It always has been that way,
especially in La when a big guy shows 

1682
01:15:05,221 --> 01:15:09,541
up,
whether it's Jerry Seinfeld or whoever 

1683
01:15:09,541 --> 01:15:09,541
the fuck it is,
they show up,

1684
01:15:09,541 --> 01:15:13,230
they get on stage and part of that 
thrill is that the audience members know

1685
01:15:14,441 --> 01:15:19,441
that if they come to the Improv,
it's very likely one night that may be 

1686
01:15:19,441 --> 01:15:23,250
Daniel Tosh or walk on walk on stage.
Even if he's not on the schedule that 

1687
01:15:23,250 --> 01:15:24,850
may be someone that you've seen on TV.
We'll walk on stage and that's a part of

1688
01:15:24,851 --> 01:15:25,420
the thrill.

1689
01:15:25,660 --> 01:15:27,410
And in,
in the,

1690
01:15:27,470 --> 01:15:30,940
the standup comic does the famous ones 
in exchange,

1691
01:15:30,941 --> 01:15:32,640
they do these sets for free.
The,

1692
01:15:32,650 --> 01:15:37,650
for the,
for their ability to just go onstage 

1693
01:15:37,650 --> 01:15:39,810
anytime they want.
And it does seem unfair to the people 

1694
01:15:39,810 --> 01:15:39,810
that are coming up.
I completely agree.

1695
01:15:39,810 --> 01:15:40,220
You know,
it's,

1696
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:41,680
it's unfair,
no doubt about it.

1697
01:15:41,681 --> 01:15:43,150
I don't do it.
But,

1698
01:15:43,510 --> 01:15:44,830
um,
I understand,

1699
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:50,240
I under,
I understand that the idea behind it 

1700
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:50,240
because every comic has had to deal with
that.

1701
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:54,860
I the only time I've ever bumped 
anybody's when I show up the club and 

1702
01:15:54,860 --> 01:15:55,030
then they asked me,
would you like to go on stage?

1703
01:15:55,031 --> 01:15:56,290
I'm like,
if it's not a big deal,

1704
01:15:56,291 --> 01:15:58,360
I'll go on stage,
but I don't want to fuck anybody's night

1705
01:15:58,361 --> 01:16:01,270
up and then they'd go and check and make
sure everything's okay,

1706
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:03,580
but if there's any drama or bullshit at 
all,

1707
01:16:03,581 --> 01:16:05,830
I would way rather just go on last.

1708
01:16:05,830 --> 01:16:07,830
Just put me on after everything's done.
Like what?

1709
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:09,820
You can't.
You can't perform at the end.

1710
01:16:10,180 --> 01:16:13,930
Everybody is so terrified of someone 
strong going on before them,

1711
01:16:14,170 --> 01:16:16,180
which is so silly because that's what 
you want.

1712
01:16:16,420 --> 01:16:17,560
You want.
Everybody laughed.

1713
01:16:17,561 --> 01:16:19,570
The reason why I started bringing you on
the road with me,

1714
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:24,720
the reason why I bring an Rv on the road
with me or done because they're fucking 

1715
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:27,871
hilarious.
I went to the Improv twice in the last 

1716
01:16:27,871 --> 01:16:28,890
10 days and both times people came up to
it.

1717
01:16:28,900 --> 01:16:30,450
They had to leave and go do it.
Yeah.

1718
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:34,900
They don't want to go on after you know 
I don't give a fuck because I'm going to

1719
01:16:34,901 --> 01:16:37,450
get off stage and you're still going to 
be in the bar drinking.

1720
01:16:37,930 --> 01:16:42,930
Take that bottom,
break it over your fucking head so 

1721
01:16:42,930 --> 01:16:44,800
before you come lie to me that you have 
a showcase at the store or you gotta go.

1722
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:47,860
Just be mad.
There was a show that just show then,

1723
01:16:48,220 --> 01:16:53,220
but don't come up to me and say you got 
to go up because your agency and your 

1724
01:16:53,220 --> 01:16:54,140
agents at all meat and cheese doodles 
don't.

1725
01:16:54,141 --> 01:16:56,110
Don't tell that she was a lot of that at
the store.

1726
01:16:56,140 --> 01:16:59,770
Guy would claim that he had a showcase.
There was guys who used to get sets.

1727
01:16:59,890 --> 01:17:04,890
They couldn't get sets,
but they could get sets when they had 

1728
01:17:04,890 --> 01:17:06,871
showcases so they would lie and say they
were having a showcase and nobody was 

1729
01:17:06,871 --> 01:17:08,920
showing no.
I got a call and say I'm accommodating.

1730
01:17:08,921 --> 01:17:10,270
And was my youngest moved?

1731
01:17:10,270 --> 01:17:11,480
Yeah,
that was my young love.

1732
01:17:11,481 --> 01:17:13,760
That movie letting Mitzi ice to melt.
That's what he did.

1733
01:17:13,761 --> 01:17:18,761
He started having regular showcase.
They give you a nine slash 15 spots to 

1734
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:21,290
come in and say hello,
get a drink.

1735
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:23,010
Some bitches,
you know,

1736
01:17:23,220 --> 01:17:28,220
that's,
that's where you see the fake it till 

1737
01:17:28,220 --> 01:17:28,220
you make it mentality,
you know,

1738
01:17:28,220 --> 01:17:28,220
when you're in the,
the,

1739
01:17:28,220 --> 01:17:30,560
the,
the dirty stages of standup development,

1740
01:17:30,561 --> 01:17:35,561
you know,
when everybody's scrounging for morsels 

1741
01:17:35,561 --> 01:17:35,780
are all trying to get onstage as much.
Especially like,

1742
01:17:36,020 --> 01:17:38,120
I don't know how the fuck anybody starts
in La.

1743
01:17:38,390 --> 01:17:39,980
That's brutal.
Brutal.

1744
01:17:40,250 --> 01:17:41,480
I mean,
I already did it already.

1745
01:17:41,481 --> 01:17:44,090
Basically did his whole career here.
But uh,

1746
01:17:44,091 --> 01:17:45,280
you know,
he,

1747
01:17:45,310 --> 01:17:46,860
he got,
he got,

1748
01:17:47,660 --> 01:17:49,850
yeah,
he and he got in early at the store too.

1749
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:52,040
He got stage time.
He got plenty of stage time.

1750
01:17:52,790 --> 01:17:56,210
That's huge man because he got in like 
just a couple of years and it was career

1751
01:17:57,070 --> 01:17:58,850
when we started hanging out with us,
you know,

1752
01:17:58,970 --> 01:18:00,290
like we started taking them on the road.

1753
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:01,140
He was,
you know,

1754
01:18:01,190 --> 01:18:03,830
just a few years into his career.
You know,

1755
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:07,100
it's amazing how,
how last year I put it together.

1756
01:18:07,101 --> 01:18:11,270
I didn't know to about 18 to two years 
ago how much I missed the store.

1757
01:18:11,300 --> 01:18:16,300
Not The fucking dickheads,
but how much I missed that type of 

1758
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:20,531
performing every night and that's why I 
made a note now that I always try to go 

1759
01:18:20,531 --> 01:18:23,420
to crazy places at least every 10 days,
twice a once a week.

1760
01:18:23,421 --> 01:18:25,520
I got to go someplace where it's 
unpredictable.

1761
01:18:25,521 --> 01:18:30,521
I don't want to be in a comedy store 
setting because I want that comedy 

1762
01:18:30,521 --> 01:18:31,640
store.
The what made me a comic was going up at

1763
01:18:31,641 --> 01:18:36,641
1145 after you have to fucking tyree 
after Mooney by the matter of fact,

1764
01:18:36,921 --> 01:18:38,050
I do ms Dot Paula.
Morning.

1765
01:18:38,350 --> 01:18:39,660
I missed that.
You want me to tell you?

1766
01:18:39,740 --> 01:18:44,740
Uh,
I missed the expression that everybody 

1767
01:18:44,740 --> 01:18:44,740
gets,
that Nigga wake up call.

1768
01:18:44,740 --> 01:18:49,690
I really do because it helps me.
It hit home with me so much more.

1769
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:52,190
When we went to Miami,
they kept saying Cuba come in.

1770
01:18:52,550 --> 01:18:53,330
Those Cubans,
this,

1771
01:18:53,331 --> 01:18:58,331
we got that Nigga wake up call with the 
little kid that they came with the idea 

1772
01:18:58,331 --> 01:18:58,331
that when they had that pulled them out 
of the closet,

1773
01:18:59,570 --> 01:19:02,230
whatever.
Fidel came right in that governor said,

1774
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:04,100
go take them.
She met me.

1775
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:05,450
She said,
go down there and take them.

1776
01:19:05,451 --> 01:19:08,030
They weren't right until the name.
What the fuck was that all about?

1777
01:19:08,090 --> 01:19:09,950
What was that all about?
Aliens.

1778
01:19:09,980 --> 01:19:12,670
Gonzalez Gonzalez.
What was,

1779
01:19:12,730 --> 01:19:15,830
what was that?
And now he's a patriarch in Cuba.

1780
01:19:15,831 --> 01:19:18,140
He's crazy.
Dick up like fucking really?

1781
01:19:18,170 --> 01:19:23,170
That joker.
Who's the retarded kid that had this TV 

1782
01:19:23,170 --> 01:19:23,170
show?
Corky corky.

1783
01:19:23,170 --> 01:19:26,650
He's like that with a bib on and Cuba in
1950 cadillac with raft kid.

1784
01:19:28,370 --> 01:19:30,050
He's good looking now.
They just had a thing.

1785
01:19:31,210 --> 01:19:36,210
His mother died and he was fucking 
floating out there on a twig and some 

1786
01:19:38,481 --> 01:19:43,481
fishermen pick them up.
Imagine what is going to happen when 

1787
01:19:43,481 --> 01:19:47,681
Fidel died because there was a fake.
Fidel died a thing on twitter the other 

1788
01:19:47,681 --> 01:19:48,080
day.
People are wondering,

1789
01:19:48,230 --> 01:19:53,230
what about the time I told Eddie Fidel 
died and he was with Dana White and he 

1790
01:19:53,230 --> 01:19:56,360
thought it was a bad conversations with 
the died.

1791
01:19:57,460 --> 01:20:00,200
Did you ever hear about that?
So I'm going to Cuban place and he calls

1792
01:20:00,201 --> 01:20:00,770
me [inaudible].
What's up?

1793
01:20:00,771 --> 01:20:02,360
I got nothing.
I'm overheating cubic foot.

1794
01:20:02,660 --> 01:20:05,640
And you know Eddie likes all that 
revolutionary down.

1795
01:20:05,650 --> 01:20:07,980
I go to Gio.
There's a rumor going around brother

1796
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:09,100
Fidel Catholic.
I said,

1797
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:10,760
Fidel died.
She's like,

1798
01:20:10,770 --> 01:20:11,700
well,
let me go online.

1799
01:20:12,180 --> 01:20:13,260
So he goes online.
He was.

1800
01:20:13,261 --> 01:20:14,940
Hold on Dana White's right here.
Let me ask him.

1801
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:21,840
Date is online looking for chocolate.
Don't die.

1802
01:20:28,110 --> 01:20:30,150
Wouldn't you want to verify that?
Hold on.

1803
01:20:30,151 --> 01:20:31,650
Did you just say

1804
01:20:32,220 --> 01:20:37,220
Ladelle?
Chuck Liddell when you want to verify 

1805
01:20:37,220 --> 01:20:39,140
that.
I call bell and see filled.

1806
01:20:39,180 --> 01:20:42,150
I said look down.
Was he on the rampage?

1807
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:44,540
Was He a.
was he a Tomahawk in?

1808
01:20:45,550 --> 01:20:46,050
No,
no,

1809
01:20:46,051 --> 01:20:47,500
no.
He was a Tomahawk and no,

1810
01:20:47,501 --> 01:20:48,090
no,
he was straight.

1811
01:20:48,091 --> 01:20:50,020
It was like 8:00
once I'd Indian comes out.

1812
01:20:50,030 --> 01:20:51,900
Right.
I remember when you first started saying

1813
01:20:51,901 --> 01:20:53,850
that about him.
Oh my God.

1814
01:20:53,851 --> 01:20:57,360
Because people don't know what that is.
It's something that's in your jeans when

1815
01:20:57,370 --> 01:21:00,770
you're digging up that when you drink,
you go to the other fucking direction.

1816
01:21:01,020 --> 01:21:02,010
When I drink,
I wish,

1817
01:21:02,011 --> 01:21:03,510
but I don't say shit.
I got to go home.

1818
01:21:04,290 --> 01:21:07,950
Some people drank a fucking fight.
I mean bro,

1819
01:21:07,951 --> 01:21:09,510
you,
you grew up in Boston.

1820
01:21:09,750 --> 01:21:14,750
You really seen motherfuckers that would
have two beers and take their shirt off 

1821
01:21:14,750 --> 01:21:15,730
in 10 degree weather and want to fight a
black bar.

1822
01:21:15,950 --> 01:21:17,670
Like we're going down that block and 
you're like,

1823
01:21:17,671 --> 01:21:20,220
you're not fucking,
are you fucking kidding me guy?

1824
01:21:20,550 --> 01:21:25,550
You cannot do that.
But there's people that drink and don't 

1825
01:21:25,550 --> 01:21:25,550
say nothing.
There's people that drink and giggle.

1826
01:21:25,710 --> 01:21:28,450
That's just some people that some people
are not supposed to be.

1827
01:21:28,460 --> 01:21:33,460
I hope they recognize it.
The most important thing is that they 

1828
01:21:33,460 --> 01:21:34,380
recognize it because they think it's fun
until they see it,

1829
01:21:34,381 --> 01:21:35,670
you know,
it's fun to them.

1830
01:21:35,700 --> 01:21:40,700
Like they just disappeared.
Like how fun would it be if you stopped 

1831
01:21:40,700 --> 01:21:43,971
being Joe Rogan and went into his face 
for eight hours and then woke up with 

1832
01:21:43,971 --> 01:21:47,940
fucking scars on your fucking pubic hair
on your face and a handcuff on.

1833
01:21:48,120 --> 01:21:52,710
It is amazing to me though when people 
have such different reactions to certain

1834
01:21:52,711 --> 01:21:53,910
drugs,
you know,

1835
01:21:53,911 --> 01:21:55,680
and that alcohol is really one of them.
That's.

1836
01:21:55,681 --> 01:21:59,580
So it's like until I met Eddie,
I didn't believe in blackouts.

1837
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:02,010
I didn't believe it didn't believe.
People tell me they blacked out,

1838
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:06,310
like how convenient chips always tell 
you that they suck your dick in your ass

1839
01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:08,610
all the next morning I blacked out.
What happened?

1840
01:22:08,611 --> 01:22:10,920
You know what happened?
My fucking ass.

1841
01:22:10,921 --> 01:22:12,180
Like a savage.
Hold on.

1842
01:22:12,181 --> 01:22:14,140
What happened?
I don't remember any.

1843
01:22:14,250 --> 01:22:15,450
Oh my God,
we did that.

1844
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:17,790
Came on your fucking neck.
Remember?

1845
01:22:17,820 --> 01:22:19,350
What?
Did you speak in a rape man?

1846
01:22:19,620 --> 01:22:21,540
I saw that movie.
The girl with the Dragon Tattoo.

1847
01:22:21,990 --> 01:22:24,450
Holy Shit.
That's a bad ass bitch.

1848
01:22:24,950 --> 01:22:26,550
Ooh,
that girl who plays it.

1849
01:22:26,551 --> 01:22:28,040
I've never seen her before.
I don't know who she is,

1850
01:22:28,041 --> 01:22:31,590
but that girl can fucking act.
That's a crazy movie,

1851
01:22:31,591 --> 01:22:32,670
man.
Whew.

1852
01:22:32,700 --> 01:22:37,700
There's some scenes in that movie.
It felt like a movie where they were 

1853
01:22:37,700 --> 01:22:40,551
trying to.
It was in fact a book that they were 

1854
01:22:40,551 --> 01:22:41,160
trying to condense down into movie form.

1855
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:43,110
It was really hard because it's 
obviously very,

1856
01:22:43,111 --> 01:22:46,020
very good located in involved,
but as you know,

1857
01:22:46,021 --> 01:22:48,150
it doesn't fail as a movie.
It's fucking good.

1858
01:22:48,151 --> 01:22:49,830
There's some,
some bad ass scenes,

1859
01:22:50,070 --> 01:22:52,880
but that check is wild.
Gina Carano movie.

1860
01:22:52,881 --> 01:22:55,770
No review.
I heard the reviews are spectacular.

1861
01:22:56,250 --> 01:22:59,190
They said that rotten tomatoes gave it a
100 percent,

1862
01:22:59,970 --> 01:23:04,970
which is like nobody ever sees that.
I mean that it's temporary because the 

1863
01:23:04,970 --> 01:23:04,970
cuts will come out and find out about 
it.

1864
01:23:06,220 --> 01:23:11,220
He didn't clear right online and some 
asshole comes on as their shit all over 

1865
01:23:11,441 --> 01:23:16,441
it just because he knows it and went to 
the movies and said that the trailer 

1866
01:23:17,110 --> 01:23:18,550
Gina Day,
they asked me that.

1867
01:23:18,551 --> 01:23:19,780
It looks wild.
They go,

1868
01:23:19,781 --> 01:23:24,781
it's fucking great.
It looks great as it come out this 

1869
01:23:24,781 --> 01:23:25,430
weekend that I know it did good.
I want one guy wide.

1870
01:23:25,660 --> 01:23:28,180
The one I seen,
I heard it's bad ass.

1871
01:23:28,180 --> 01:23:29,830
Bad Ass.
I heard like the God,

1872
01:23:29,870 --> 01:23:31,930
that guy's like a real artist who 
created it,

1873
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:32,320
you know,
he,

1874
01:23:32,321 --> 01:23:35,680
he really knows what the fuck he's doing
and he really created this around her.

1875
01:23:36,070 --> 01:23:39,940
You know of the world needs more ass 
kicking checks.

1876
01:23:40,630 --> 01:23:45,630
Fun.
We'll get the one chick that trying to 

1877
01:23:45,630 --> 01:23:45,630
make it.
She's a bad motherfucker.

1878
01:23:45,630 --> 01:23:48,080
The Australian check with Kate 
Beckinsale oh,

1879
01:23:48,310 --> 01:23:50,230
bad ass bitch.
That bitch is bad.

1880
01:23:50,231 --> 01:23:53,130
I've seen up close and personal.
Toronto is so legit though.

1881
01:23:53,180 --> 01:23:55,270
Come around the world and you know what 
she's like,

1882
01:23:55,390 --> 01:23:58,810
really like now that Cyborg tested 
positive.

1883
01:23:59,710 --> 01:24:03,730
It shows it shines a light on all the 
cyborgs,

1884
01:24:03,731 --> 01:24:05,710
past victories,
and you gotta you gotTa.

1885
01:24:05,711 --> 01:24:06,580
Look at it and go,
man,

1886
01:24:06,581 --> 01:24:10,030
it's unfortunately cast doubt tasks down
in her old career,

1887
01:24:10,210 --> 01:24:15,210
especially since they released a video 
that showed her first fight ever in her 

1888
01:24:15,210 --> 01:24:15,210
first fight ever.

1889
01:24:15,210 --> 01:24:17,140
She was not built like that at all.
Not even remotely.

1890
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:22,280
You know,
she changed and she changed pretty 

1891
01:24:22,280 --> 01:24:22,280
radically and it doesn't seem to be 
endogenous chemicals.

1892
01:24:22,280 --> 01:24:24,550
If you have an initial video of her from
a long time ago,

1893
01:24:24,551 --> 01:24:26,860
they chose a different body,
different body types,

1894
01:24:26,861 --> 01:24:27,910
and that's not,
you know,

1895
01:24:27,940 --> 01:24:28,760
you're not a man.
Well,

1896
01:24:28,761 --> 01:24:30,070
how are you?
How are you doing that man?

1897
01:24:30,310 --> 01:24:32,050
So you've got to look at that man and 
say,

1898
01:24:32,140 --> 01:24:37,140
this Gina Carano man,
if she didn't know that would have been 

1899
01:24:37,140 --> 01:24:39,961
imagined.
Gina Carano versus route Ronda Rousey 

1900
01:24:39,961 --> 01:24:41,860
two of the hottest chicks to ever fight.
Ever going at it.

1901
01:24:41,950 --> 01:24:45,530
Do you know nuts that fucking fight?
Would it be to stone cold?

1902
01:24:45,531 --> 01:24:50,531
It's gonna Hands.
That's the next one to tens that are 

1903
01:24:50,531 --> 01:24:53,311
killers and they're throwing down Gina 
Carano versus Ronda Rousey would get 

1904
01:24:53,311 --> 01:24:58,141
like,
that's like a fight that actually could 

1905
01:24:58,141 --> 01:24:58,141
make it into the UFC.

1906
01:24:58,141 --> 01:24:58,150
Like that's a fight.
We're Dana white would be like,

1907
01:24:58,151 --> 01:24:59,200
you know what,
alright,

1908
01:24:59,740 --> 01:25:04,740
this fight.
I would have this fight in the UFC is 

1909
01:25:04,740 --> 01:25:07,291
like a special attraction.
I mean I'm just guessing it would do 

1910
01:25:07,291 --> 01:25:09,421
that.
He would probably have like a big event 

1911
01:25:09,421 --> 01:25:09,421
for strikeforce,
but I mean,

1912
01:25:09,421 --> 01:25:13,230
could you imagine the kind of press you 
can get when you get to chicks who are 

1913
01:25:13,230 --> 01:25:16,891
super hot,
who actually can fucking fight both of 

1914
01:25:16,891 --> 01:25:20,611
them?
She'll get the winter of those two 

1915
01:25:20,611 --> 01:25:23,530
because it made sense to me today at the
movie did really well.

1916
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:28,150
If she would have fought in June or July
and she wouldn't have done well then the

1917
01:25:28,151 --> 01:25:29,140
movie,
they said,

1918
01:25:29,141 --> 01:25:30,480
fuck it.
Stay away from everything.

1919
01:25:30,490 --> 01:25:31,870
Just let the movie come out,
pop it.

1920
01:25:32,050 --> 01:25:37,050
All of a sudden the fucking Brazilian 
comes up positive and she's back in the 

1921
01:25:37,050 --> 01:25:37,060
fucking game.
The movie big.

1922
01:25:37,060 --> 01:25:38,650
Great.
She's back in the fucking game now,

1923
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:40,870
so she's going to probably get the 
winter of tea,

1924
01:25:40,900 --> 01:25:43,570
take on a fight,
man.

1925
01:25:43,970 --> 01:25:44,870
See what,
why would she,

1926
01:25:46,270 --> 01:25:47,660
why would she want to fight if this 
movie?

1927
01:25:48,790 --> 01:25:50,950
Then she just goes off and you know,
man,

1928
01:25:50,951 --> 01:25:53,200
brain damages for keeps.
If you don't want to fight,

1929
01:25:53,201 --> 01:25:54,450
you shouldn't be fighting.
You know,

1930
01:25:54,640 --> 01:25:57,730
fighting is something you should only do
when you absolutely want to do.

1931
01:25:57,731 --> 01:25:58,540
Just that.
If she,

1932
01:25:58,570 --> 01:26:00,580
if she really has this call on the back 
of her head,

1933
01:26:00,581 --> 01:26:02,530
she wants to get back in there and test 
herself.

1934
01:26:02,590 --> 01:26:03,270
You know,
she's,

1935
01:26:03,380 --> 01:26:05,270
she's a bad ass chick.
She wants to do that.

1936
01:26:05,271 --> 01:26:06,700
But I love it.
A debt.

1937
01:26:06,770 --> 01:26:07,850
No,
no reason to do it.

1938
01:26:07,851 --> 01:26:09,920
If she doesn't,
she's got an amazing opportunity.

1939
01:26:10,190 --> 01:26:15,190
She has an opportunity that very few 
humans ever get to be a real legit 

1940
01:26:15,190 --> 01:26:16,550
female movie action star.

1941
01:26:17,060 --> 01:26:17,600
I mean,
she's,

1942
01:26:17,810 --> 01:26:19,940
she's going to say the right things.
She's smart.

1943
01:26:20,210 --> 01:26:22,670
She's not a mean person.
She's a humble person.

1944
01:26:22,671 --> 01:26:24,200
She's like,
she's like a happy,

1945
01:26:24,201 --> 01:26:26,150
friendly person that people like root 
for,

1946
01:26:26,350 --> 01:26:27,680
you know,
even checks like her,

1947
01:26:27,970 --> 01:26:29,540
you know?
And then also they like about her.

1948
01:26:29,630 --> 01:26:32,600
She's not like real skinny.
She's not all skinny and bones.

1949
01:26:32,601 --> 01:26:33,950
She's,
she's got meat on her.

1950
01:26:33,980 --> 01:26:38,130
She's,
oh it's high fat.

1951
01:26:38,430 --> 01:26:41,360
That man.
Yeah,

1952
01:26:41,390 --> 01:26:42,590
I liked that.
I don't like,

1953
01:26:42,860 --> 01:26:45,060
I don't like skinny on a girl.
It doesn't.

1954
01:26:45,260 --> 01:26:47,540
I like a girl is not afraid to eat,
you know,

1955
01:26:48,020 --> 01:26:50,120
to me,
don't go and get sloppy.

1956
01:26:50,150 --> 01:26:52,880
Let's not get crazy.
But you can get a little fat,

1957
01:26:52,910 --> 01:26:54,410
little fat.
It's actually kind of sexy.

1958
01:26:55,020 --> 01:26:58,170
Something dirty about it.
Keeps the monkey fresh.

1959
01:26:58,430 --> 01:27:00,170
Does it?
And lubes the joints,

1960
01:27:00,230 --> 01:27:05,230
the joints.
It was some fucking ice and I acetone 

1961
01:27:05,230 --> 01:27:05,230
and Khloe line and shit.

1962
01:27:05,230 --> 01:27:05,720
Everything's good.
You know what I'm saying?

1963
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:10,960
Yeah.
The world needs more bad ass superhero 

1964
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:10,960
chicks.
This dragon tattoo check.

1965
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:15,300
And this is Gina Carano check.
I seen that other fucking crazy ass 

1966
01:27:15,300 --> 01:27:16,270
movie.
Black Swan with mine.

1967
01:27:16,271 --> 01:27:17,710
Occula.
Whatever her name is.

1968
01:27:18,190 --> 01:27:20,610
That bitch.
Get the fuck out of the professionals.

1969
01:27:20,640 --> 01:27:23,440
Little girlfriend cause she's the one in
it as the black swamp.

1970
01:27:24,020 --> 01:27:27,590
I don't tell me I'm going to watch the 
beginning.

1971
01:27:27,591 --> 01:27:32,591
It scared me out.
But the ending of this movie is very 

1972
01:27:32,591 --> 01:27:36,041
fucking.
I seen the last hour last night and it 

1973
01:27:36,041 --> 01:27:36,041
really helped me.
It was shit on television.

1974
01:27:36,041 --> 01:27:37,540
I wanted to watch them like,
wait a second.

1975
01:27:38,270 --> 01:27:43,270
The one girl is all grown up.
I can't believe that was her and the 

1976
01:27:43,270 --> 01:27:43,770
professional.
That movie's a fucking great movie.

1977
01:27:43,780 --> 01:27:46,110
It's a great machine.
It was on the I nine.

1978
01:27:46,120 --> 01:27:51,120
I watched Gary Oldham is fucking great.
He would pop the pills and throw his 

1979
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:53,530
neck back and heroin and shooting 
motherfuckers and carry.

1980
01:27:53,540 --> 01:27:55,280
Homo was great in that movie.
He was great.

1981
01:27:55,281 --> 01:27:57,130
Danny Aiello is even in that movie.
Oh yeah.

1982
01:27:57,200 --> 01:27:58,080
He's the,
he's the hit,

1983
01:27:58,081 --> 01:28:00,470
but he's the guy that gives uh,
the Italian guy.

1984
01:28:00,471 --> 01:28:03,320
The assignments and shit.
Yes.

1985
01:28:03,950 --> 01:28:08,950
Fucking Danny Aiello.
I think he even stopped doing comedy 

1986
01:28:08,950 --> 01:28:08,950
now.
Denny a lot.

1987
01:28:08,950 --> 01:28:13,750
He had a comedy club in hoboken on 
Tuesday night place and he would put my 

1988
01:28:13,750 --> 01:28:16,010
name up on a bunch of comments.
The songs?

1989
01:28:16,011 --> 01:28:16,880
Yeah.
Are you serious?

1990
01:28:16,881 --> 01:28:21,881
I swear to God.
What was that show that he had on CBS 

1991
01:28:21,881 --> 01:28:22,220
for awhile?
A Terra Nova something.

1992
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:25,250
Look it up.
The last disaster of CBS,

1993
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:30,600
a melon Ghana or something like that,
that he was a PA public investigator

1994
01:28:32,420 --> 01:28:34,130
Chrysler on 10 TV,

1995
01:28:34,580 --> 01:28:37,120
whether it's people's name.
How do you suppose named Danielle?

1996
01:28:37,460 --> 01:28:40,280
I know a I e l l o

1997
01:28:40,870 --> 01:28:45,770
pressure on CBS News in Columbus,
Ohio and he got to do the weather and it

1998
01:28:45,771 --> 01:28:47,710
was so fucking hilarious.
If you what?

1999
01:28:47,711 --> 01:28:52,711
What did he do?
He was just like acting out like if it 

2000
01:28:52,711 --> 01:28:52,711
was cold,
but for her,

2001
01:28:52,711 --> 01:28:52,870
you know,
and like just making a.

2002
01:28:53,060 --> 01:28:54,920
He was just burnt Chrysler on the 
whether it was.

2003
01:28:54,950 --> 01:28:55,790
What if you could imagine.

2004
01:28:55,850 --> 01:29:00,850
That's awesome.
Is that TV show than Gosha Della 

2005
01:29:02,930 --> 01:29:02,930
Delavan?

2006
01:29:04,380 --> 01:29:06,690
Look at the IMB be.
I'm looking at it.

2007
01:29:06,740 --> 01:29:09,600
Nineteen 98.
That was the last temptation of Christ.

2008
01:29:09,780 --> 01:29:11,340
What year was this?
[inaudible] 98,

2009
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:15,870
which will delve into Aventura when we 
first started hanging out in Miami.

2010
01:29:15,871 --> 01:29:17,380
When they put his picture up at the 
Improv,

2011
01:29:18,780 --> 01:29:22,290
I clipped it onto my shirt and yeah,
I kept it out.

2012
01:29:22,291 --> 01:29:24,990
He was my favorite,
a goof for awhile.

2013
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:28,200
I have all those on the.
I still have those old vhs sussman.

2014
01:29:28,380 --> 01:29:30,600
When they were,
they had the king of Queens over at CBS.

2015
01:29:30,690 --> 01:29:35,690
I got them to get me the tapes from the 
Delavan tour show because it was so 

2016
01:29:35,690 --> 01:29:36,420
delicious now and have people come over 
and watch it with me.

2017
01:29:36,710 --> 01:29:38,640
We wouldn't get high and watch it like 
it was a comedy,

2018
01:29:39,060 --> 01:29:40,500
so fuck.
It was a great show.

2019
01:29:40,590 --> 01:29:43,290
He would always win no matter what 
happened.

2020
01:29:43,380 --> 01:29:48,380
This is what I remember.
He had a meeting with this guy about 

2021
01:29:48,380 --> 01:29:49,650
some information that could lead to the 
conclusion of my case.

2022
01:29:49,860 --> 01:29:54,000
Susan there playing pool and he can't 
mess just fucking rocketing balls in and

2023
01:29:54,001 --> 01:29:56,160
the guy goes,
worst acting of all time.

2024
01:29:56,190 --> 01:29:58,140
The WHO's playing goes,
hey man,

2025
01:29:58,440 --> 01:30:01,170
you're the best I ever seen.
What's your secret?

2026
01:30:01,171 --> 01:30:02,370
He goes,
my secret,

2027
01:30:02,790 --> 01:30:07,790
don't miss.
And it was like fights.

2028
01:30:08,101 --> 01:30:10,620
He would get in fights and he's a rusty 
old man.

2029
01:30:10,650 --> 01:30:11,760
I mean he's old,
he's old,

2030
01:30:11,820 --> 01:30:12,690
he's old.
I mean,

2031
01:30:12,691 --> 01:30:15,480
we're not talking about US investors to 
loan old worries,

2032
01:30:15,481 --> 01:30:19,780
you know,
shooting fucking synthetic hormones into

2033
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:21,570
his body every day and he's 64 years 
old.

2034
01:30:23,490 --> 01:30:28,490
That's not what I'm talking about.
I'm talking like he looks like an old 

2035
01:30:28,490 --> 01:30:30,681
man,
but meanwhile he's knocking dudes out 

2036
01:30:30,681 --> 01:30:30,681
with one punch.
Pop like,

2037
01:30:30,681 --> 01:30:30,681
guys,
give them trouble.

2038
01:30:30,681 --> 01:30:31,050
Hey,
get outta here.

2039
01:30:31,580 --> 01:30:34,020
He just everywhere he goes,
like no one's hitting him.

2040
01:30:34,110 --> 01:30:36,160
He's never got a struggle.
Yeah,

2041
01:30:36,210 --> 01:30:41,210
he's dominated everything.
He's just the coolest cop of all time 

2042
01:30:41,210 --> 01:30:44,610
and it's so ridiculous that it becomes 
funny.

2043
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:47,550
It's becomes really subtle.
So Nice.

2044
01:30:47,580 --> 01:30:49,440
We're going to sit alone and crazy 
Italians,

2045
01:30:49,441 --> 01:30:51,900
I guess frank stallone's been coming 
back to the boxing gym.

2046
01:30:51,901 --> 01:30:54,100
Justin's and they can't take them no 
more.

2047
01:30:54,101 --> 01:30:56,670
So the quickest way to get rid of 
Frankston loans to put wrap on.

2048
01:30:57,420 --> 01:31:00,810
Oh really hates rap music.
So they put rap on like,

2049
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:05,840
you know,
Nwa and they have bets on how long the 

2050
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:08,681
loan or last and really.
So he's in their shadow box and he'll 

2051
01:31:08,681 --> 01:31:09,200
look at the speakers,
he'll fuck it.

2052
01:31:09,220 --> 01:31:10,350
Then he'll come up to them and say,
listen,

2053
01:31:10,351 --> 01:31:12,690
why don't we listen to some good music 
put on one of my albums?

2054
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:16,410
And they all look at him like,
are you fucking serious?

2055
01:31:17,190 --> 01:31:22,190
He'll give you his album.
You know that frank stallone and gives 

2056
01:31:22,190 --> 01:31:22,190
album albums.
He plays right here at fucking Malibu.

2057
01:31:22,190 --> 01:31:23,940
The Malibu when?
Once a month he's got the.

2058
01:31:24,580 --> 01:31:27,970
You got to go as a goof on time.
All the Italian show update.

2059
01:31:27,980 --> 01:31:32,980
Kiss him.
What do you think his relationship is 

2060
01:31:32,980 --> 01:31:32,980
like with his brother?
What do you think it would be?

2061
01:31:32,980 --> 01:31:33,740
It must be crazy.
Get the fuck Outta here.

2062
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:35,490
Locked the door behind you.
Dumb fuck.

2063
01:31:35,850 --> 01:31:40,850
I'm going to invest in a cheeseburger 
chain and you're going to be the head 

2064
01:31:40,850 --> 01:31:42,330
singer.
That guy's got to come in every day with

2065
01:31:42,331 --> 01:31:43,920
a different pitch.
Slide.

2066
01:31:43,921 --> 01:31:45,270
Don't mean to bother you,
but listen,

2067
01:31:45,271 --> 01:31:46,830
we've got an idea for a new movie.

2068
01:31:47,160 --> 01:31:52,160
I think they even made a movie together.
The one with dice that die sued 

2069
01:31:52,160 --> 01:31:52,160
everybody.
Remember?

2070
01:31:52,160 --> 01:31:54,180
They all just alone.
Remember that for no.

2071
01:31:54,190 --> 01:31:57,050
A movie about golf?
Yeah.

2072
01:31:57,060 --> 01:32:02,060
Lilly,
about when we were at the store were 

2073
01:32:02,060 --> 01:32:02,060
telling us a story that night and didn't
never got.

2074
01:32:02,650 --> 01:32:04,900
Never got released because it is fucking
horrible.

2075
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:07,390
It is frank stallone,
directing and shit.

2076
01:32:07,690 --> 01:32:12,690
It's the loans.
Got All his friends and it's still bad 

2077
01:32:12,690 --> 01:32:15,100
pictures of birds and fucking people 
drinking water loans,

2078
01:32:15,270 --> 01:32:18,070
hitting a golf ball and shit.
Oh my God.

2079
01:32:18,071 --> 01:32:20,440
That's hilarious.
Frank fucking stallone.

2080
01:32:20,740 --> 01:32:22,480
Oh my God.
That is hilarious.

2081
01:32:24,860 --> 01:32:25,070
That'd

2082
01:32:25,070 --> 01:32:30,070
be a weird thing to have a brother 
that's like super duper famous and 

2083
01:32:30,070 --> 01:32:32,420
you're just hanging on trying to make 
some shit happen.

2084
01:32:32,570 --> 01:32:36,470
That's gotTa to be frustrating as fuck.
Probably makes you want to be famous.

2085
01:32:36,510 --> 01:32:38,180
Also like look at Charlie Murphy,
you know,

2086
01:32:38,240 --> 01:32:40,660
and he's probably,
that's why he.

2087
01:32:40,820 --> 01:32:43,160
Well it is totally with Charlie,
but Charlie is actually,

2088
01:32:43,161 --> 01:32:43,850
you know,
he's made it.

2089
01:32:43,851 --> 01:32:45,140
He's making money,
he's doing well,

2090
01:32:45,141 --> 01:32:50,141
he's in movies,
doing great with standup and then 

2091
01:32:50,141 --> 01:32:50,141
there's like,
you know,

2092
01:32:50,141 --> 01:32:50,270
the Baldwin brothers where everybody 
makes it,

2093
01:32:50,390 --> 01:32:52,310
you know,
everyone sort of sort of,

2094
01:32:52,311 --> 01:32:54,710
kind of that they made it for a little 
while.

2095
01:32:54,810 --> 01:32:57,940
All of them were in the light for awhile
while,

2096
01:32:58,610 --> 01:33:00,790
but now it's only Alec.
He's the only one who,

2097
01:33:01,200 --> 01:33:02,600
he's the most talented though,
right?

2098
01:33:02,690 --> 01:33:03,710
Yeah.
Oh definitely.

2099
01:33:03,990 --> 01:33:04,820
Yeah.
That's what it is.

2100
01:33:04,821 --> 01:33:07,700
Like talent just rises to the top.
Like there was another one I liked,

2101
01:33:08,180 --> 01:33:11,030
but I only bought one billy William.
Now William,

2102
01:33:11,270 --> 01:33:12,440
I think will's a difference.
Bill.

2103
01:33:12,450 --> 01:33:17,450
He's the handsome one.
Williams the one with the big face I 

2104
01:33:17,450 --> 01:33:17,450
think I'll see.
I don't remember.

2105
01:33:17,450 --> 01:33:17,980
But he's handsome too.
He's just handsome.

2106
01:33:17,990 --> 01:33:22,990
Like,
like he drank a lot of sodium filled 

2107
01:33:22,990 --> 01:33:22,990
products.
Sodium.

2108
01:33:24,260 --> 01:33:25,450
Yeah,
they are A.

2109
01:33:25,700 --> 01:33:29,070
I mean there's a bunch of families where
there's a bunch of different brothers or

2110
01:33:29,071 --> 01:33:30,560
get in and everybody does so.
So,

2111
01:33:30,580 --> 01:33:32,750
but one guy is like the best.
But the ball.

2112
01:33:32,751 --> 01:33:34,070
Michael Jackson.
Yeah.

2113
01:33:34,310 --> 01:33:36,980
Well that's the most ridiculous 
whenever.

2114
01:33:37,100 --> 01:33:37,820
Right?
Right.

2115
01:33:38,170 --> 01:33:43,170
You know,
you imagine growing up with someone 

2116
01:33:43,170 --> 01:33:43,170
who's uh,
your brother and you,

2117
01:33:43,170 --> 01:33:43,880
you're both doing the same thing and you
just can't fucking hit.

2118
01:33:44,150 --> 01:33:47,450
And this guy's just gotTa.
That's gotta be nuts,

2119
01:33:47,451 --> 01:33:49,870
man.
Sibling rivalry is a motherfucker.

2120
01:33:50,470 --> 01:33:53,390
Look at Mcdonald's brothers.
She threw that motherfucker out.

2121
01:33:53,690 --> 01:33:58,690
What happened?
Like she threw him the fight and that 

2122
01:33:58,690 --> 01:33:58,690
guy was just creepy.
He was opening up shit with her name.

2123
01:33:58,690 --> 01:34:01,250
I mean it just gets old Mcdonald's 
brothers and stiff.

2124
01:34:01,251 --> 01:34:03,500
He's got a brother that wrote the book,
the tell all book.

2125
01:34:04,070 --> 01:34:09,070
Now he just had something on the AOL 
Google the other day that he's homeless 

2126
01:34:09,070 --> 01:34:12,731
and Michigan is just the won't help them
because you get fucking creepy on these 

2127
01:34:12,731 --> 01:34:12,731
people.

2128
01:34:12,731 --> 01:34:13,940
Don't,
can't get previously a family.

2129
01:34:14,330 --> 01:34:14,990
You can't.
Right.

2130
01:34:14,991 --> 01:34:17,440
Tell all books and the same thing that 
makes them.

2131
01:34:17,441 --> 01:34:20,330
Madonna could also make a loser.
You don't.

2132
01:34:20,331 --> 01:34:25,331
You don't get a Madonna with 
conventional child rearing and paying 

2133
01:34:25,731 --> 01:34:28,040
off the right amount of attention to 
your kids.

2134
01:34:28,070 --> 01:34:30,920
Know you get a Madonna.
If you fucked up,

2135
01:34:31,100 --> 01:34:33,020
you get a madonna.
If you ignored that kid,

2136
01:34:33,021 --> 01:34:35,180
you get a madonna.
If somebody did something to it,

2137
01:34:35,200 --> 01:34:37,750
an early age that made her determined or
you get a guy,

2138
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:39,710
a guy,
one of the same thing.

2139
01:34:40,010 --> 01:34:41,710
You don't get those.
Those chicks are in the.

2140
01:34:41,720 --> 01:34:44,690
It's not easy to develop one of those.
You've got to give him some pain.

2141
01:34:44,691 --> 01:34:47,420
You got to do so things.
Did you rather fuck Madonna or Gaga?

2142
01:34:47,900 --> 01:34:49,940
Right now I'm going Gaga for sure.
Yeah,

2143
01:34:49,941 --> 01:34:51,920
she's hot.
Her body is hot as fuck.

2144
01:34:51,921 --> 01:34:56,120
Dude.
That fucking pretty bad ass.

2145
01:34:56,240 --> 01:34:57,670
Not really.
No.

2146
01:34:57,680 --> 01:35:00,100
Diamond got old macdonald last week.
She got old.

2147
01:35:00,140 --> 01:35:04,460
She's trying to force those biceps and 
tell people she's a Jew and I did have a

2148
01:35:04,461 --> 01:35:07,910
dream that I ran into Madonna and all of
a sudden she was young again.

2149
01:35:08,030 --> 01:35:13,030
It's amazing.
You just brought this up because I had 

2150
01:35:13,030 --> 01:35:13,030
this dream last night and I'm just 
remembering it now.

2151
01:35:13,030 --> 01:35:14,780
It was one of those really fucking Nutty
Alpha brain dreams,

2152
01:35:15,020 --> 01:35:18,560
which no one will deny if you.
You could say you don't think that Alpha

2153
01:35:18,561 --> 01:35:23,561
brain works.
It doesn't seem to affect you and 

2154
01:35:23,561 --> 01:35:23,561
enhance your cognitive function.
That's all.

2155
01:35:23,561 --> 01:35:24,250
Well and good.
You know,

2156
01:35:24,280 --> 01:35:29,280
I don't know how your brain works,
but you can't tell me that it's not 

2157
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:34,241
super reliable for making crazy dreams 
because I don't know if I can take a 

2158
01:35:34,581 --> 01:35:37,640
pill that I knew for sure if I took the 
shit before bedtime.

2159
01:35:37,850 --> 01:35:39,800
Apparently it's not working for 
everybody though.

2160
01:35:39,950 --> 01:35:42,380
A lot of people say they're not getting 
the lucid dreams.

2161
01:35:42,740 --> 01:35:44,420
You know,
a lot of times at the beginning of it.

2162
01:35:44,421 --> 01:35:47,440
You headed at the beginning,
but then I stopped having them real.

2163
01:35:47,441 --> 01:35:48,290
Yeah.
Well,

2164
01:35:48,291 --> 01:35:50,720
I get them intermittently and I never 
know when they're coming,

2165
01:35:50,750 --> 01:35:55,750
but I got one last night and it was 
super vivid and last night it was me 

2166
01:35:55,750 --> 01:35:58,430
hanging out with Madonna and I was being
like real creepy with her.

2167
01:35:58,670 --> 01:36:01,040
I was like,
it was weird because she was like,

2168
01:36:01,550 --> 01:36:04,230
actually it was like some sort of a 
weird thing like I was,

2169
01:36:04,290 --> 01:36:06,260
I was much younger than I am now.
Um,

2170
01:36:06,440 --> 01:36:10,850
I remember because I remember I had no 
family and no responsibility in my dream

2171
01:36:10,851 --> 01:36:12,970
is that I just asked me how I know about
them in a bar,

2172
01:36:13,010 --> 01:36:14,180
like a shitty bar.
Nope.

2173
01:36:14,270 --> 01:36:19,270
It was some weird fucking a booth of a 
club and I'm like really close to her 

2174
01:36:19,270 --> 01:36:21,530
skin and I'm admiring her skin and I'm 
telling her,

2175
01:36:21,531 --> 01:36:22,850
wow,
you look amazing.

2176
01:36:22,850 --> 01:36:25,470
Like I'm really like blown away.
It was like,

2177
01:36:25,850 --> 01:36:30,850
because I guess I had,
I couldn't figure out in the stream 

2178
01:36:30,850 --> 01:36:31,310
whether I'd traveled through time or,
you know,

2179
01:36:31,311 --> 01:36:36,311
whether uh,
I lived in a different place when it 

2180
01:36:36,311 --> 01:36:39,760
was.
I actually 17 years old and when she 

2181
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:41,360
actually 24 it was I was in 1984,
1985 again,

2182
01:36:41,540 --> 01:36:46,540
or was this supposed to be?
She rejuvenated and she's now 20 years 

2183
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:50,390
old again and now she looks hot as fuck 
because she looked even younger than she

2184
01:36:50,391 --> 01:36:55,391
looked.
When she became famous there was a 

2185
01:36:55,391 --> 01:36:55,391
really weird dream because I couldn't 
figure out what was happening in it.

2186
01:36:55,391 --> 01:36:56,470
I couldn't figure out if,
you know,

2187
01:36:57,460 --> 01:36:58,010
I was like,
why?

2188
01:36:58,040 --> 01:37:00,300
Why do I feel like I'm a young man?
I could just,

2189
01:37:00,500 --> 01:37:02,270
but I also have all this information in 
my head.

2190
01:37:02,271 --> 01:37:05,350
It's very strange,
but I met Don to.

2191
01:37:05,570 --> 01:37:07,640
I used to have a thing for Madonna man 
when I was young.

2192
01:37:10,540 --> 01:37:12,590
I thought she was hot as fuck because 
she was dirty.

2193
01:37:12,830 --> 01:37:14,630
She was dirty,
dirty Italian.

2194
01:37:14,830 --> 01:37:19,830
When you're young,
a young little 17 year old savage with 

2195
01:37:19,830 --> 01:37:23,891
your hormones on full blast like I was.
I was like so excited that a girl is 

2196
01:37:23,891 --> 01:37:25,130
dirty.
She's dirty.

2197
01:37:25,131 --> 01:37:25,700
That pitch.
Yeah.

2198
01:37:25,710 --> 01:37:27,350
What?
She's like the original snookie.

2199
01:37:28,640 --> 01:37:33,640
How dare you fucking.
I used to go to this club called making 

2200
01:37:33,640 --> 01:37:34,040
yourself laugh when I was in high 
school.

2201
01:37:34,041 --> 01:37:36,680
I was a senior in high school.
I used to go to this club called,

2202
01:37:37,730 --> 01:37:41,090
I can't remember it now,
and when I was in there every Saturday,

2203
01:37:41,091 --> 01:37:46,091
you know was a girl would come in.
I don't even know who the fuck the girl 

2204
01:37:46,091 --> 01:37:50,051
was and they let us say,
but I've never really paid attention 

2205
01:37:50,051 --> 01:37:52,841
because he was lip singing,
just play a song and that's terrible 

2206
01:37:52,841 --> 01:37:55,680
data really.
She was saying back then back then,

2207
01:37:55,710 --> 01:37:55,990
well

2208
01:37:56,310 --> 01:37:58,080
it was a club.
It was at this goal,

2209
01:37:58,081 --> 01:38:01,340
a rooftop or something and a Dj and 
Austin.

2210
01:38:01,350 --> 01:38:06,350
They go,
we have a special for somebody to come 

2211
01:38:06,350 --> 01:38:06,350
in.
She's going to sing a song,

2212
01:38:06,350 --> 01:38:06,350
and it was madonna singing.
I'm like,

2213
01:38:06,350 --> 01:38:06,730
Lucky Star.
We didn't.

2214
01:38:06,731 --> 01:38:09,990
Yeah,
we didn't know at that time it when they

2215
01:38:09,991 --> 01:38:14,991
first started having videos on MTV and 
you for folks today that live in this 

2216
01:38:15,510 --> 01:38:17,460
day and era,
this is not going to be impressive,

2217
01:38:17,670 --> 01:38:22,670
but back then when Madonna first started
having these music videos like burning 

2218
01:38:22,670 --> 01:38:25,760
up,
that's a.

2219
01:38:25,880 --> 01:38:28,860
that's all she took.
She took with Donna Summers,

2220
01:38:28,890 --> 01:38:30,690
was doing it and was like,
you know what,

2221
01:38:30,691 --> 01:38:32,970
you just not being clear enough what you
want.

2222
01:38:34,110 --> 01:38:39,110
Let me tell you what I'm looking for.
I'm looking to where it crosses and get 

2223
01:38:39,110 --> 01:38:39,110
fucked hard.
I'm going,

2224
01:38:39,110 --> 01:38:43,220
we're going to wear lace and get choked 
that you want to be,

2225
01:38:43,270 --> 01:38:45,090
but you can't let go.
Come on,

2226
01:38:45,110 --> 01:38:47,310
let's go.
I'm burning.

2227
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:52,650
I'm burning in sex.
Tremendous,

2228
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:57,800
tremendous.
Then she had that dancer body with a 

2229
01:38:57,800 --> 01:38:57,800
little plumpness to her too.
You know,

2230
01:38:57,800 --> 01:38:59,370
like she was eating well for the first 
time in her life.

2231
01:38:59,940 --> 01:39:04,940
God Damn desperately seeking.
Susan came on the street.

2232
01:39:05,161 --> 01:39:07,230
She does a million fucking people.
Yeah.

2233
01:39:07,290 --> 01:39:10,170
People don't even know what a gay.
Nobody was like a female.

2234
01:39:10,171 --> 01:39:15,171
Michael Jackson at that point.
Michael Jackson had been there with her 

2235
01:39:15,171 --> 01:39:15,171
and 84 and a half close Manhattan.
Yeah.

2236
01:39:15,171 --> 01:39:19,530
People I don't are really even aware of 
how big Madonna at one point in time,

2237
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:22,380
you know Janet blue?
Yeah.

2238
01:39:22,540 --> 01:39:24,690
The second one is like a virgin,
which is good.

2239
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:27,300
That's a great one to blue.
Isn't that fucking good?

2240
01:39:27,301 --> 01:39:30,260
But it's got a couple.
It's got a uh,

2241
01:39:30,340 --> 01:39:33,510
you abandon me.
Love the old jam,

2242
01:39:33,750 --> 01:39:35,130
Bro.
Do you know what I put on twitter that I

2243
01:39:35,131 --> 01:39:38,340
thought of you the best fucking jam of 
all time?

2244
01:39:38,520 --> 01:39:43,050
The Best Leonard Skin it.
Fuck led Zepplin Fuck Pink Floyd because

2245
01:39:43,051 --> 01:39:45,340
there is nothing better than groove is 
in the heart dog.

2246
01:39:45,810 --> 01:39:50,150
The other morning I heard on the radio,
I almost pulled over.

2247
01:39:50,980 --> 01:39:55,220
Check the dancing girl.
She got arrested for heroin.

2248
01:39:55,260 --> 01:40:00,260
Really?
Tonight when nobody's around and nobody 

2249
01:40:00,260 --> 01:40:03,470
smoke,
a half of dubin put the video on and 

2250
01:40:03,470 --> 01:40:03,470
watch it.
Watch it.

2251
01:40:03,470 --> 01:40:04,860
That Chinese kid was doing and awesome.
Bootsy collins.

2252
01:40:04,890 --> 01:40:06,860
That was awful.
Fucking jail.

2253
01:40:07,160 --> 01:40:11,160
I don't care how bad of a mood.
Urine and you can be in a bad mood doing

2254
01:40:11,161 --> 01:40:16,161
something.
And by the middle of that second verse 

2255
01:40:16,161 --> 01:40:16,380
to the entity that you just started 
fucking not dancing,

2256
01:40:16,381 --> 01:40:17,160
but you're like,
you know what?

2257
01:40:17,161 --> 01:40:18,260
It could be worse.
Look at this.

2258
01:40:18,280 --> 01:40:20,950
She loved the way that girls.
What's he saying?

2259
01:40:20,951 --> 01:40:25,650
That began says so let's play it.
Can we play it?

2260
01:40:25,660 --> 01:40:26,850
Yeah,
they're not.

2261
01:40:26,970 --> 01:40:28,430
They're on jail.
Just fucking fine.

2262
01:40:29,160 --> 01:40:30,070
Meanwhile,
it's owned by.

2263
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:38,760
So we heard the gym one time and you 
were singing that.

2264
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:41,370
Which grilled buffalo stand.
Oh yeah.

2265
01:40:41,910 --> 01:40:46,910
Sherry and Sherry fucking name Jam Nina.
She had a couple of good ones.

2266
01:40:49,190 --> 01:40:52,890
What was the with the buffalo state.
I love Nina Cherry.

2267

2269
01:40:58,601 --> 01:41:00,240

2270
01:41:00,620 --> 01:41:01,410
she had.
She.

2271
01:41:01,440 --> 01:41:04,310
She had so much potential to.
When you saw her singing,

2272
01:41:04,320 --> 01:41:07,870
you like that girl's star.
And then Tracy Chapman.

2273
01:41:08,380 --> 01:41:13,380
Tracy Chapman.
But before Tracy Tracy Chapman had a

2281
01:41:37,240 --> 01:41:40,030

2286
01:41:50,190 --> 01:41:52,830

2287
01:41:52,831 --> 01:41:57,750
And I know this song now Dan.
This is something like that.

2289
01:42:00,031 --> 01:42:00,510

Okay.

They focused on my boss.

2303
01:42:39,560 --> 01:42:40,190

I don't care if we get to play this.

2319
01:43:21,190 --> 01:43:23,020
Just play on your laptop.
Can I do that?

2320
01:43:23,021 --> 01:43:28,021
So illegal.
But that now that'll have to pause the 

2321
01:43:28,021 --> 01:43:28,440
youtube.
So when.

2322

kicking it where I played the meatball 
king.

2328
01:43:41,580 --> 01:43:43,740
It was like one of Batman's villains.
Oh really?

2329
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:48,760
I have a bazooka.
Like scarface that shoots meatballs 

2330
01:43:48,760 --> 01:43:48,760
balls.
The kids and shit at the end.

2331
01:43:48,760 --> 01:43:50,310
Wait till this comes out.

2335
01:43:55,570 --> 01:43:58,300
How many episodes do you do to this 
general hospital?

2336
01:43:58,360 --> 01:44:02,730
For so far I think they're gonna because
Sundays going so any new moms would come

2337
01:44:02,731 --> 01:44:05,020
in and smack them.
Bitches know what I'm saying?

2338
01:44:05,880 --> 01:44:07,870
What do you have to do?
So far?

2339
01:44:07,871 --> 01:44:10,180
I just was a reverend.
I went to jail.

2340
01:44:10,181 --> 01:44:12,070
I went to prison and reverend.
Yeah,

2341
01:44:12,071 --> 01:44:13,960
I'm married.
I'm a reverend in this.

2342
01:44:14,380 --> 01:44:17,160
My name is game runner instead of mad 
flavor.

2343
01:44:17,161 --> 01:44:21,700
It's game runner game here,
a game runner game running.

2344
01:44:21,730 --> 01:44:23,290
Brian,
did you lower my volume now?

2345
01:44:25,200 --> 01:44:29,440
Turn it back up and turn that into a 
game runner.

2346
01:44:29,650 --> 01:44:33,220
Game runner came on the show as a guy 
that went to prison with Anthony.

2347
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:36,790
When I went to jail I got my life and I 
became a minister,

2348
01:44:36,791 --> 01:44:41,500
so I come and married one of his checks 
that he kidnapped me straight up.

2349
01:44:41,770 --> 01:44:44,050
Kidnaps this chicken.
I married him on the show.

2350
01:44:44,080 --> 01:44:45,490
Do you have any scenes with any hot 
checks?

2351
01:44:45,780 --> 01:44:47,630
AIPAC,
the blonde,

2352
01:44:47,950 --> 01:44:52,950
but I didn't know.
Like I watched the first time they got 

2353
01:44:52,950 --> 01:44:52,950
black people on General Hospital.
I didn't know that.

2354
01:44:52,950 --> 01:44:53,540
So talking to you?
Yeah,

2355
01:44:53,560 --> 01:44:58,560
it was very shocking to me.
I didn't even see if they passed that 

2356
01:44:58,560 --> 01:44:59,450
law in 99 and then the brothers fucking 
soap operas.

2357
01:44:59,770 --> 01:45:02,500
Where is the brothers?
And then she'll have like a black soul.

2358
01:45:02,501 --> 01:45:04,600
Well,
son did used to do soap operas,

2359
01:45:04,930 --> 01:45:07,270
which was in,
what was he in?

2360
01:45:08,650 --> 01:45:10,370
Was he in general hospital or something 
like that,

2361
01:45:11,980 --> 01:45:13,960
but whatever it was,
he was on top.

2362
01:45:14,280 --> 01:45:15,270
Yeah,
we're sons.

2363
01:45:15,310 --> 01:45:16,840
Talented man.
That who?

2364
01:45:17,660 --> 01:45:19,720
Raja.
For people who don't know,

2365
01:45:19,721 --> 01:45:22,180
that's a.
that's a hilarious comedian.

2366
01:45:22,181 --> 01:45:27,181
All that.
There's like all these videos of me 

2367
01:45:27,181 --> 01:45:27,181
arguing with a crazy Brazilian jujitsu 
guy online.

2368
01:45:27,181 --> 01:45:30,460
That's my friend Russ on and he's A.
He's an Eddie Bravo Brown belts.

2369
01:45:30,461 --> 01:45:31,930
He's just an actor.
He's just,

2370
01:45:31,990 --> 01:45:36,990
he's this character that he does and 
every now and then he'll want to 

2371
01:45:36,990 --> 01:45:39,931
confront me about some things and get 
into this big long arguments like 

2372
01:45:39,931 --> 01:45:40,480
Eddie's Eddie thinks it's hilarious.
He loves doing it.

2373
01:45:40,481 --> 01:45:45,070
So Eddie sets it up all the time,
but his actual name is for song and he's

2374
01:45:45,071 --> 01:45:46,330
hilarious.
How funny is it?

2375
01:45:46,331 --> 01:45:51,331
That resigned?
Father was my first karate teacher when 

2376
01:45:51,331 --> 01:45:51,331
I came from.
It's amazing.

2377
01:45:51,331 --> 01:45:55,230
So how's that circle fucking flow with 
amazing resigns and it was such a great 

2378
01:45:56,210 --> 01:45:58,600
guy bro.
And we have to get reassigned.

2379
01:45:58,601 --> 01:46:00,790
To tell you the story about his father's
karate school,

2380
01:46:01,140 --> 01:46:04,030
his father's karate schools on 100 
street and Amsterdam.

2381
01:46:04,550 --> 01:46:05,830
It was,
it was black.

2382
01:46:05,920 --> 01:46:09,640
It was painted black.
The walls were black biggies with black.

2383
01:46:10,120 --> 01:46:11,140
Black was beautiful.

2384
01:46:11,140 --> 01:46:14,410
It was like 70.
You've got a fist go Jew,

2385
01:46:14,411 --> 01:46:19,411
you gotTa fucking fist and said go Jew.
And you've got this thing on the back 

2386
01:46:19,411 --> 01:46:23,061
and a Japanese letters.
Let me tell you what he used to make us 

2387
01:46:23,061 --> 01:46:23,061
do.
Her son's father,

2388
01:46:23,061 --> 01:46:27,700
he'd make us run to central park 
barefoot with the fucking karate 

2389
01:46:27,700 --> 01:46:29,320
uniforms on.
Know how scared I used to be at barefoot

2390
01:46:29,321 --> 01:46:31,150
on the street run,
run,

2391
01:46:31,151 --> 01:46:33,310
run.
He makes us fucking run whenever.

2392
01:46:33,320 --> 01:46:35,570
Fees on what if you saw broken down?
She'll play.

2393
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:37,630
Didn't give a flop.
That's what toughen you up.

2394
01:46:37,960 --> 01:46:39,550
Mine number one.
Time is resigned.

2395
01:46:39,551 --> 01:46:41,980
Father kicked me in the stomach when I 
was about six.

2396
01:46:42,130 --> 01:46:44,160
You know when the ad comes out of you 
for the first time I took one,

2397
01:46:44,161 --> 01:46:46,920
like I'm wanting to go back to karate,
but he was a good guy bro.

2398
01:46:47,030 --> 01:46:49,150
He taught me a lot of good shit.
My first karate,

2399
01:46:49,680 --> 01:46:50,670
Joe Esposito,

2400
01:46:50,670 --> 01:46:55,670
who's now the head of the,
he's one of the big guys at the 

2401
01:46:56,750 --> 01:46:58,050
Massachusetts State Athletic Commission,
so they regulate mixed martial arts.

2402
01:46:58,410 --> 01:47:00,860
I took her class from him and he signed,
kicked me in the stomach.

2403
01:47:01,920 --> 01:47:04,860
They would do bad.
They would say tighten up.

2404
01:47:04,920 --> 01:47:06,210
I mean,
he didn't hit me hard.

2405
01:47:06,211 --> 01:47:09,360
I was only like 14.
He just gave me a little little tap,

2406
01:47:09,510 --> 01:47:11,000
but that was common,
you know,

2407
01:47:11,130 --> 01:47:16,130
the instructor would walk by,
tighten up and they'd fucking blast in 

2408
01:47:16,130 --> 01:47:16,130
the stomach while you're in line,
you know,

2409
01:47:16,130 --> 01:47:17,910
you had to always be prepared,
always be solid.

2410
01:47:18,470 --> 01:47:21,100
You know,
where the Koreans came over to teach tae

2411
01:47:21,101 --> 01:47:23,010
kwon normally walk around with a stick.
Oh yeah.

2412
01:47:23,630 --> 01:47:28,630
In the back of the legs if you get.
Koreans were like super strict fluid 

2413
01:47:28,630 --> 01:47:30,090
restriction.
But because of that there their team was

2414
01:47:30,091 --> 01:47:31,470
fucking monstrous.
Man.

2415
01:47:31,471 --> 01:47:34,140
The Korean national team for a while 
until the,

2416
01:47:34,141 --> 01:47:36,930
the real uh,
the Americans got real good at it.

2417
01:47:36,930 --> 01:47:41,930
And then there was some other entries 
from other parts of the world that were 

2418
01:47:41,930 --> 01:47:44,391
like really high level.
But for awhile the Koreans just 

2419
01:47:44,391 --> 01:47:47,060
dominated taekwondo tournament and a lot
of it was the high level training and 

2420
01:47:47,060 --> 01:47:48,340
the discipline that they had there,
they took it serious.

2421
01:47:48,350 --> 01:47:51,450
Now you can't hit your kids no more.
You can't try out a friend.

2422
01:47:51,490 --> 01:47:52,630
My friend was,
uh,

2423
01:47:52,770 --> 01:47:55,830
going to med school,
my friend junk sick and he,

2424
01:47:55,890 --> 01:47:58,570
he won the national championships.
He had it.

2425
01:47:58,571 --> 01:48:01,200
He took time off to,
to win the nationals.

2426
01:48:01,201 --> 01:48:03,570
He took time off to train,
took time off,

2427
01:48:03,571 --> 01:48:08,571
away from the school,
which was a big fucking deal because he 

2428
01:48:08,571 --> 01:48:09,150
was going through like some serious,
serious fucking schoolwork.

2429
01:48:09,390 --> 01:48:14,390
And I remember watching this kid,
I couldn't believe how fucking hard he 

2430
01:48:14,390 --> 01:48:14,390
worked,
you know,

2431
01:48:14,390 --> 01:48:16,170
it was just,
it was incredible to watch.

2432
01:48:16,171 --> 01:48:21,171
It was,
it was really like inspiring because 

2433
01:48:21,171 --> 01:48:21,171
this guy was always tired.

2434
01:48:21,171 --> 01:48:25,760
He was exhausted and yet he would still 
find time to train and we were talking 

2435
01:48:25,760 --> 01:48:25,790
about it,
you know,

2436
01:48:25,830 --> 01:48:27,570
back then he was a little bit ahead of 
me.

2437
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:28,690
He was like,
um,

2438
01:48:28,890 --> 01:48:32,940
when I was hitting a national level of 
my skills,

2439
01:48:33,090 --> 01:48:38,090
he was already there.
So he was like a little bit ahead of me 

2440
01:48:38,090 --> 01:48:38,090
and uh,
I remember talking to him,

2441
01:48:38,090 --> 01:48:38,860
I'm like,
how are you doing this?

2442
01:48:38,861 --> 01:48:41,100
Like,
this is incredible that you find time to

2443
01:48:41,101 --> 01:48:44,910
do all this school work and yet you 
still find time to train.

2444
01:48:45,330 --> 01:48:46,680
And he's like,
I barely can do it.

2445
01:48:46,681 --> 01:48:47,370
I barely could do it.
He goes,

2446
01:48:47,371 --> 01:48:48,960
I'm so tired.
I'm so tired.

2447
01:48:48,961 --> 01:48:50,820
He would like when he was training for 
the nationals,

2448
01:48:50,940 --> 01:48:55,940
he would do his homework and then he 
would put his backpack on with all of 

2449
01:48:55,940 --> 01:48:59,040
his books and he would run up and down 
the stairs in his,

2450
01:48:59,041 --> 01:49:04,041
uh,
in his dormitory where he stayed and it 

2451
01:49:04,041 --> 01:49:07,251
was just,
that's how he would get like a lot of 

2452
01:49:07,251 --> 01:49:07,251
his cardio training in it would just put
his books in his bag and run up and down

2453
01:49:07,251 --> 01:49:07,380
the stairs.

2454
01:49:07,680 --> 01:49:09,870
And he would tell me about like how 
exhausted he was when he,

2455
01:49:09,890 --> 01:49:11,730
when he would come to work out and 
train.

2456
01:49:11,940 --> 01:49:14,640
But that fucking guy just kept chipping 
away.

2457
01:49:14,980 --> 01:49:16,890
And it's like,
I learned a lot watching that dude.

2458
01:49:16,920 --> 01:49:21,920
Like,
we'll learn that there's like levels of 

2459
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:22,830
commitment and discipline and for 
whatever reason,

2460
01:49:22,930 --> 01:49:27,930
a lot of Asian people instill that in 
their children that like real intense 

2461
01:49:30,541 --> 01:49:32,020
discipline,
you know,

2462
01:49:32,070 --> 01:49:34,410
proud of their kid when their kid 
becomes a doctor,

2463
01:49:34,411 --> 01:49:36,630
proud of their kid when the kid said 
something really,

2464
01:49:36,631 --> 01:49:38,810
really difficult,
that's a,

2465
01:49:38,920 --> 01:49:40,140
that's a mother fucker,
man,

2466
01:49:40,170 --> 01:49:41,400
that's a,
that's a to,

2467
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:42,880
to,
to have like that,

2468
01:49:43,010 --> 01:49:46,080
that high expectations of yourself,
you know,

2469
01:49:46,081 --> 01:49:48,850
you're really setting up for a very 
stressful,

2470
01:49:48,851 --> 01:49:53,851
stressful life.
And I know he eventually stopped 

2471
01:49:53,851 --> 01:49:53,851
competing because it was too much,
you know,

2472
01:49:53,851 --> 01:49:55,510
to do that.
And he assumed his,

2473
01:49:55,540 --> 01:49:56,470
his practice,
you know,

2474
01:49:56,471 --> 01:49:58,990
to,
to become a doctor and you know,

2475
01:49:58,991 --> 01:50:00,700
and,
and studies to become a doctor.

2476
01:50:00,890 --> 01:50:03,850
And he got right back into that now,
but became 100 percent of his focus.

2477
01:50:03,851 --> 01:50:05,060
But he did what he wanted to do,
you know,

2478
01:50:05,080 --> 01:50:08,080
he got there,
he got where he wanted to get and then,

2479
01:50:08,081 --> 01:50:13,081
you know,
he realized his dream and that was just 

2480
01:50:13,081 --> 01:50:13,081
back to work.
And I was like,

2481
01:50:13,081 --> 01:50:13,081
man,
that's a,

2482
01:50:13,081 --> 01:50:14,620
that's a tough life.
That's a lot of work.

2483
01:50:14,650 --> 01:50:16,930
You don't look at the discipline,
even with the Japanese,

2484
01:50:17,240 --> 01:50:18,700
with the Yakuza,
they fuck up.

2485
01:50:18,701 --> 01:50:20,770
They gotta cut a finger off.
Yeah.

2486
01:50:20,790 --> 01:50:22,600
That's that discipline in the United 
States.

2487
01:50:22,860 --> 01:50:27,860
Comfortable at work late.
You're going to cut a fucking finger up 

2488
01:50:27,860 --> 01:50:29,380
and you have to cut it off yourself.
That's the motherfucker didn't see.

2489
01:50:29,381 --> 01:50:31,120
If somebody grabs you and cut your 
finger up you.

2490
01:50:31,121 --> 01:50:32,930
Well you have to go in there with a 
knife,

2491
01:50:33,220 --> 01:50:37,960
put your hand in thing and tie advantage
over your hand and drive yourself to the

2492
01:50:37,970 --> 01:50:38,700
fucking hospital.

2493
01:50:38,710 --> 01:50:39,370
I said,
oh,

2494
01:50:39,430 --> 01:50:42,930
that's a level of commitment and that's 
the fucking up for slipping.

2495
01:50:42,940 --> 01:50:45,580
They let you live,
but you fucking finger you.

2496
01:50:45,581 --> 01:50:48,150
She was the whole thing or a joint.
Is it like a big thing?

2497
01:50:48,200 --> 01:50:50,890
The whole thing off the joint.
Everything really.

2498
01:50:51,400 --> 01:50:54,280
They start like they take joints off 
though.

2499
01:50:54,340 --> 01:50:56,320
They chop like I dunno,
I,

2500
01:50:56,380 --> 01:50:58,360
I think that's what it is.
It's digital.

2501
01:50:58,420 --> 01:50:59,790
It's like,
what does it matter?

2502
01:50:59,990 --> 01:51:03,970
I fuck up and I cut my fucking manicure.
I told my fucking jam or something,

2503
01:51:04,390 --> 01:51:06,640
but for me to cut a finger off.
I mean that's just,

2504
01:51:06,641 --> 01:51:08,680
that's.
And you do it with honor?

2505
01:51:08,900 --> 01:51:11,500
Yeah.
You do it with like you come in and go,

2506
01:51:11,501 --> 01:51:14,410
I'm sorry I fucked up out of my respect 
for you.

2507
01:51:14,411 --> 01:51:18,070
I'm going to chop my fucking finger up 
to my family.

2508
01:51:18,071 --> 01:51:23,071
That's that.
I was talking to a friend of mine who 

2509
01:51:23,071 --> 01:51:25,560
had something going on where he was 
involved with a bunch of a businessman 

2510
01:51:26,350 --> 01:51:27,160
and they.

2511
01:51:27,250 --> 01:51:32,250
One of them was this Japanese guy that 
kept showing off the fact that his 

2512
01:51:32,250 --> 01:51:34,870
finger was missing like cat.
He would flaunt it.

2513
01:51:35,170 --> 01:51:36,990
The fact is in laugh about it,
it's fingers,

2514
01:51:36,991 --> 01:51:41,991
Mr.
see that you see that like apparently 

2515
01:51:41,991 --> 01:51:43,750
like I guess in Japan and must carry a 
lot of weight.

2516
01:51:43,830 --> 01:51:48,830
Someone sees someone sees you with a 
finger that you probably chopped off 

2517
01:51:48,830 --> 01:51:52,561
yourself like Ooh,
this guy's willing to take shit to a 

2518
01:51:52,561 --> 01:51:53,650
different level and they've been touting
themselves up for 200 fucking years.

2519
01:51:53,651 --> 01:51:58,651
Like the bodysuit body body tax and the 
way they do this super painful super 

2520
01:51:58,651 --> 01:52:00,340
fucking pain.
All that shit is just.

2521
01:52:00,570 --> 01:52:05,570
It's a different approach than the 
traditional method of tapping that tat 

2522
01:52:05,570 --> 01:52:07,960
tat tat tat the way they do it very 
different than like a needle,

2523
01:52:08,080 --> 01:52:08,920
like a,
like a,

2524
01:52:08,921 --> 01:52:12,460
a tattoo and modern tattoo needed where 
they essentially just draw it.

2525
01:52:12,820 --> 01:52:13,960
It wasn't like that back then.

2526
01:52:15,090 --> 01:52:18,040
That's how Steve got his tattoo and he 
will just tie tattoos.

2527
01:52:18,300 --> 01:52:23,300
You went to the same person.
That engine Lena Jelly did it and got 

2528
01:52:23,300 --> 01:52:23,300
the exact same tattoo.
She well for awhile.

2529
01:52:23,300 --> 01:52:24,740
Every tattoo that she got,
he would get to.

2530
01:52:25,340 --> 01:52:27,590
He would recreate her tattoos.
So fun.

2531
01:52:28,080 --> 01:52:33,080
It's taking it to the next level and 
really loves her because these crazy I 

2532
01:52:33,080 --> 01:52:36,921
love.
I love the fact that people like Steve 

2533
01:52:36,921 --> 01:52:38,991
Will there that I love.
The fact is people that are willing to 

2534
01:52:38,991 --> 01:52:38,991
climb up a tree and little lion come get
you.

2535
01:52:38,991 --> 01:52:43,880
He was great.
We got to get him on this podcast for 

2536
01:52:43,880 --> 01:52:46,920
sure.
Gets he gets he loathes Angelina Jolie 

2537
01:52:46,920 --> 01:52:46,920
or.
Yeah.

2538
01:52:46,920 --> 01:52:47,630
Well I don't know.
My thing is we love the loves,

2539
01:52:47,631 --> 01:52:52,631
the idea of the goof of it.
You know that he's going to get every 

2540
01:52:52,631 --> 01:52:53,210
tattoo that she gets.
So he went to billy Bob on his arm.

2541
01:52:53,210 --> 01:52:54,350
Does he have Billy Bama?
His arm?

2542
01:52:54,440 --> 01:52:55,700
No,
but that would be funny.

2543
01:52:55,701 --> 01:53:00,701
I don't know if he.
Maybe he took it off when she took hers 

2544
01:53:00,701 --> 01:53:03,041
off because she took hers off.
He actually took off his shirt on when 

2545
01:53:03,041 --> 01:53:03,041
we had him on one,
that old podcast at my apartment.

2546
01:53:03,041 --> 01:53:04,910
He took off his shirt and showed us all 
his tattoos.

2547
01:53:04,970 --> 01:53:09,970
Oh yeah.
He's got a shitload of no one's on his 

2548
01:53:09,970 --> 01:53:09,970
back or a pretty amazing.
And they has a picture of himself on his

2549
01:53:09,970 --> 01:53:11,280
back.
He does like,

2550
01:53:11,600 --> 01:53:13,790
it looks like an airbrush.
Like perfect.

2551
01:53:14,300 --> 01:53:17,450
That's your choice though.
That's really a questionable choice.

2552
01:53:17,451 --> 01:53:20,660
I could see getting Angelina's the 
tattoos on your body,

2553
01:53:20,661 --> 01:53:23,980
but doing a tattoo of your own face.
So what?

2554
01:53:24,050 --> 01:53:26,300
The people that got a tattoo?
A George Lopez.

2555
01:53:26,870 --> 01:53:28,930
Oh yeah,
that's a fucking statue.

2556
01:53:28,940 --> 01:53:29,960
Yeah.
Live with forever.

2557
01:53:30,410 --> 01:53:33,790
Will you do.
Now that he got fucking file off 10 do.

2558
01:53:34,690 --> 01:53:37,040
Well he's still going to tour and 
probably kill him.

2559
01:53:37,760 --> 01:53:41,960
He's never going to be at a long for,
for income if he decides to tour,

2560
01:53:42,020 --> 01:53:44,460
you know.
Don't you think that guy was selling out

2561
01:53:44,480 --> 01:53:46,640
the Hollywood bowl?
Who's selling all giant places?

2562
01:53:47,970 --> 01:53:49,810
I just took a flight last week with 
Paul.

2563
01:53:49,880 --> 01:53:51,560
Regina on the flight.
Oh yeah.

2564
01:53:51,640 --> 01:53:56,640
You've got to get up on that microphone.
Sit right next to me talking about the 

2565
01:53:56,640 --> 01:53:57,630
store and it's pretty interesting to 
talk to.

2566
01:53:57,710 --> 01:53:59,600
Paul Rodriguez was there in the early 
days,

2567
01:53:59,601 --> 01:54:04,601
right?
Wasn't he there and that Chico in the 

2568
01:54:04,601 --> 01:54:04,601
man days when when fucking homeboy 
killed themselves.

2569
01:54:05,430 --> 01:54:06,800
What was that guy's name to kill 
themselves?

2570
01:54:07,080 --> 01:54:08,270
Freddie prinze,
Freddie Prinze,

2571
01:54:08,600 --> 01:54:10,940
and the guy who took his place was Danny
Maura,

2572
01:54:10,970 --> 01:54:13,310
who's also a comedy store.
Regular.

2573
01:54:13,680 --> 01:54:16,350
Took his place.
She chicos plays for a season.

2574
01:54:16,351 --> 01:54:20,130
Then you weren't going to replace 
fucking Freddy parties.

2575
01:54:20,200 --> 01:54:22,520
Friends at that time.
Who is to commit?

2576
01:54:22,520 --> 01:54:25,400
That jumped off the building of the 
comedy store right next door.

2577
01:54:25,490 --> 01:54:26,770
I don't know who they're going to 
remember that.

2578
01:54:26,771 --> 01:54:27,470
Right?
Well,

2579
01:54:27,471 --> 01:54:28,790
I heard the story,
but I don't know who.

2580
01:54:28,791 --> 01:54:33,791
The guy was mad that some guy jumped off
the building right next to the comedy 

2581
01:54:33,791 --> 01:54:35,810
store at that though.
Hide Hotel or whatever it's called.

2582
01:54:35,870 --> 01:54:40,870
That was during the,
the the riots or the whatever the fuck 

2583
01:54:40,870 --> 01:54:42,370
it was.
Now there's an advertisement for mad men

2584
01:54:42,371 --> 01:54:47,371
on there where it's just a shadow of 
somebody falling down that building and 

2585
01:54:47,371 --> 01:54:49,730
it's so creepy to look at because that's
the shadow.

2586
01:54:49,740 --> 01:54:51,710
That's exactly where that guy killed 
himself.

2587
01:54:52,280 --> 01:54:54,770
I wonder if they knew that now.
I don't think I do.

2588
01:54:55,610 --> 01:54:57,190
You don't think that now?
I don't mean,

2589
01:54:57,200 --> 01:54:58,630
isn't it?
Yeah,

2590
01:54:58,720 --> 01:55:03,720
and a lot of people at the comedy store,
like I said something to them and 

2591
01:55:03,720 --> 01:55:03,720
they're like,
oh my God,

2592
01:55:03,720 --> 01:55:03,720
you're right.

2593
01:55:03,720 --> 01:55:05,170
Holy Shit.
I didn't even think of that.

2594
01:55:05,470 --> 01:55:07,820
There was anyone that was thinking that 
was the boycott,

2595
01:55:07,821 --> 01:55:09,440
right?
They boycotted all the clubs.

2596
01:55:09,640 --> 01:55:10,520
You know,
back in the day,

2597
01:55:10,550 --> 01:55:13,730
comedy clubs in La didn't pay anything.
Now they pay a little bit,

2598
01:55:13,731 --> 01:55:16,310
they pay a tiny bit,
but back then they didn't pay a God damn

2599
01:55:16,311 --> 01:55:19,100
thing and so guys were packing the place
and killing them.

2600
01:55:19,101 --> 01:55:22,250
Then all the clubs were making money and
the truck clubs or treats you like shit.

2601
01:55:22,450 --> 01:55:24,830
So the only,
the only place where clubs get away with

2602
01:55:24,831 --> 01:55:29,831
that,
they have that sort of slave owner 

2603
01:55:29,831 --> 01:55:30,290
mentality like some of them do,
some of them do still to this day.

2604
01:55:30,291 --> 01:55:33,650
They think that you're doing some sort 
of an honor by performing there.

2605
01:55:33,850 --> 01:55:35,780
So how many stores really tighten their 
ship lately?

2606
01:55:35,781 --> 01:55:38,750
That they got a whole new staff and 
there are no one's the same anymore.

2607
01:55:38,751 --> 01:55:41,130
That it's completely like a normal club 
now.

2608
01:55:41,131 --> 01:55:41,810
I think.
Which one?

2609
01:55:41,820 --> 01:55:43,980
The comedy story.
The last year

2610
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:46,350
they've just pretty much overhauled the 
whole entire thing.

2611
01:55:46,351 --> 01:55:48,150
So now it's like a food.
Yeah,

2612
01:55:48,151 --> 01:55:51,450
it's got food that people are getting 
paid or getting spots.

2613
01:55:51,670 --> 01:55:56,670
The only thing that you don't see is you
don't see a lot of new comics going 

2614
01:55:56,670 --> 01:55:59,901
through there a lot.
It's still kind of like the same like 

2615
01:55:59,901 --> 01:55:59,901
you know,
like a Saturday night live season.

2616
01:56:00,350 --> 01:56:03,030
How could it possibly be improving with 
those people at the helm?

2617
01:56:03,210 --> 01:56:04,590
Yeah.
Well I mean the.

2618
01:56:04,620 --> 01:56:06,640
I think Tommy is the only person that,
that,

2619
01:56:06,830 --> 01:56:11,830
that you would know their lives are 
problem and that bartender people back 

2620
01:56:12,690 --> 01:56:14,010
all the buckets still there.
Oh yeah.

2621
01:56:14,011 --> 01:56:16,020
All those guys are still there.
That guy's cool as fuck.

2622
01:56:16,160 --> 01:56:17,550
There was a,
you know,

2623
01:56:17,610 --> 01:56:18,710
you talk about it.
We've talked about it.

2624
01:56:18,711 --> 01:56:19,860
It was a.
That was a cool time.

2625
01:56:20,250 --> 01:56:21,930
You know,
that was a fun place to hang out.

2626
01:56:22,200 --> 01:56:24,660
That's what everybody misses about it.
And you know what?

2627
01:56:24,780 --> 01:56:28,050
It's a.
It was never was what the ice houses.

2628
01:56:28,290 --> 01:56:30,960
The ice house is way better.
It's a way better vibe.

2629
01:56:31,140 --> 01:56:33,690
The fact that we got that podcast room 
right next to it,

2630
01:56:33,870 --> 01:56:38,870
the fact that everybody's hanging around
there and you don't know who's the GM 

2631
01:56:38,870 --> 01:56:38,870
though now or.
I think he's the GM.

2632
01:56:38,870 --> 01:56:41,880
Yeah,
he's the GM is Adam now from Arizona.

2633
01:56:42,810 --> 01:56:47,810
So it's like the dean,
the new Dean is the guy that we're 

2634
01:56:47,810 --> 01:56:47,810
friends with.
It used to be at the,

2635
01:56:47,810 --> 01:56:47,810
uh,
the Improv in.

2636
01:56:47,970 --> 01:56:48,870
Oh,
that's hilarious.

2637
01:56:48,910 --> 01:56:50,400
And the manager will good for him,
man.

2638
01:56:51,630 --> 01:56:53,460
Go serve this purpose with that.
Yeah.

2639
01:56:53,730 --> 01:56:58,730
It was like that bar you went to for a 
year when you lived in that place where 

2640
01:56:58,730 --> 01:56:58,730
you ate,
that it served its purpose.

2641
01:56:58,840 --> 01:57:01,680
You know,
it was there for me and moved on.

2642
01:57:01,681 --> 01:57:06,681
And I don't even think about it no more 
when I drive by that it's weird foreign 

2643
01:57:06,681 --> 01:57:08,110
fucking place to me.
I'll even try to drive down there.

2644
01:57:08,111 --> 01:57:13,111
I have this download today and I drove 
by and it's like I don't even look no 

2645
01:57:13,111 --> 01:57:13,390
more.
It's strange when I do drive by drive by

2646
01:57:13,490 --> 01:57:17,620
felt bad if he didn't stop in like I 
keep on finding a new place or something

2647
01:57:17,621 --> 01:57:18,450
and you're like,
let me stop.

2648
01:57:18,460 --> 01:57:23,460
And then.
So we used to do the Improv on melrose 

2649
01:57:23,460 --> 01:57:23,460
for New Year's

2650
01:57:23,460 --> 01:57:27,190
right back to the store and hang out and
keep on finding new rooms and knucks 

2651
01:57:27,190 --> 01:57:30,610
like I just found a new nut the other 
day and I guess it's polly's office 

2652
01:57:30,610 --> 01:57:31,250
where he got that third set of stairs 
and I'm like,

2653
01:57:31,251 --> 01:57:33,420
what the fuck is this place all about?
And that's like,

2654
01:57:33,421 --> 01:57:35,240
oh this is where you fuck a girl if you 
want to.

2655
01:57:35,241 --> 01:57:36,860
Or you could smoke weed and like.
And I'm like,

2656
01:57:36,861 --> 01:57:39,550
oh this is awesome.
Hilarious.

2657
01:57:39,640 --> 01:57:43,340
At that place has got so many tunnels 
and secrets and hiding spots.

2658
01:57:43,400 --> 01:57:46,640
Does poly still keep an office there?
I think he might,

2659
01:57:46,641 --> 01:57:50,150
but he's never there probably.
I never see what does he see him once in

2660
01:57:50,151 --> 01:57:52,760
a while?
I do know he's on the road a lot.

2661
01:57:52,790 --> 01:57:57,790
I think he does and he's doing movies.
He just released that movie recently 

2662
01:57:57,790 --> 01:57:58,520
and,
and I don't know what he's doing.

2663
01:57:58,730 --> 01:58:03,730
I saw him the other day.
He had a camera crew there where he's 

2664
01:58:03,730 --> 01:58:05,180
like doing some kind of thing,
like filming something.

2665
01:58:05,240 --> 01:58:06,240
I don't know.
Wow.

2666
01:58:06,560 --> 01:58:09,590
But he's barely ever there.
There's people like that.

2667
01:58:09,591 --> 01:58:11,150
We'd just go,
where is that guy now?

2668
01:58:11,210 --> 01:58:14,570
I watched John Barris again this weekend
and both nights.

2669
01:58:14,571 --> 01:58:17,120
And that's the best shit about the 
economy store when it's.

2670
01:58:17,390 --> 01:58:18,260
He,
he,

2671
01:58:18,470 --> 01:58:22,670
I think I got there at like one and we 
didn't leave the comedy store.

2672
01:58:22,671 --> 01:58:25,190
Don didn't finished until like 4:00
AM.

2673
01:58:26,030 --> 01:58:28,550
He got offstage.
That's awesome.

2674
01:58:28,840 --> 01:58:31,010
You know,
comedy clubs stays till 4:00

2675
01:58:31,010 --> 01:58:31,240
AM.
Yeah.

2676
01:58:31,290 --> 01:58:36,290
That club is.
We had some crazy things happen in that 

2677
01:58:36,290 --> 01:58:36,290
place.
Yeah.

2678
01:58:36,290 --> 01:58:37,730
Especially that original roommate let 
original world was just.

2679
01:58:38,040 --> 01:58:40,100
That's a heavenly body,
you know,

2680
01:58:40,580 --> 01:58:41,680
that's a,
that's uh,

2681
01:58:41,710 --> 01:58:42,100
that's.

2682
01:58:42,340 --> 01:58:44,800
There's more,
there's more energy in that room.

2683
01:58:44,801 --> 01:58:46,560
There's more history in that room,
you know,

2684
01:58:46,910 --> 01:58:50,020
veteran mostly.
Really any club in the country keeps you

2685
01:58:50,021 --> 01:58:51,510
in check that room.
Yeah,

2686
01:58:51,610 --> 01:58:56,610
always keeps you in check.
You could be at a weekend place all 

2687
01:58:56,610 --> 01:58:56,610
weekend,
killing Monday.

2688
01:58:56,610 --> 01:58:58,050
You pull up the comedy store,
you think good,

2689
01:58:58,060 --> 01:59:00,290
bad to the bone and you get not a 
fucking laugh.

2690
01:59:00,340 --> 01:59:02,890
There's always drama and crazy shit 
happening.

2691
01:59:02,910 --> 01:59:07,910
Yeah.
Well there is no one's ever like quiet 

2692
01:59:07,910 --> 01:59:07,910
in the audience.
It's always fucking chaos.

2693
01:59:07,910 --> 01:59:12,770
There was a girl Friday night and she 
was definitely a hooker that she was 

2694
01:59:12,770 --> 01:59:12,770
just sitting there using that.
Patty,

2695
01:59:12,770 --> 01:59:15,180
a lot of hookers sit at the patio 
because they can like,

2696
01:59:15,240 --> 01:59:16,950
oh,
like there's a patio in the front that's

2697
01:59:16,951 --> 01:59:18,430
outside where people walk back and 
forth,

2698
01:59:18,720 --> 01:59:21,450
up and down sunset.
So a lot of the hookers just hang out at

2699
01:59:21,451 --> 01:59:23,820
the patio and they look like normal 
girls at first.

2700
01:59:23,821 --> 01:59:26,130
But then he realized what they're doing.
They're just using the patio.

2701
01:59:26,160 --> 01:59:27,260
How do they,
uh,

2702
01:59:27,270 --> 01:59:27,870
well,
this girl,

2703
01:59:27,871 --> 01:59:32,871
this was the most funniest thing ever.
Like we would walk up and everyone's 

2704
01:59:32,871 --> 01:59:32,871
staring at this girl at the bar and I'm 
like,

2705
01:59:32,871 --> 01:59:32,880
what?
What's going on here?

2706
01:59:32,970 --> 01:59:34,200
And I'm like,
Holy Shit,

2707
01:59:34,380 --> 01:59:39,380
but the back of her,
she had only a thong on like a string 

2708
01:59:39,380 --> 01:59:41,220
Bikini Thong or whatever,
and then just see through a mini skirt.

2709
01:59:41,250 --> 01:59:43,220
Like you could see completely her 
butthole.

2710
01:59:43,230 --> 01:59:46,710
You could see it was crazy,
like it could not be legal.

2711
01:59:46,800 --> 01:59:47,610
And I'm like,
oh my God.

2712
01:59:47,611 --> 01:59:48,560
And she,
her body was man.

2713
01:59:48,561 --> 01:59:49,800
It was all right.
So I was like,

2714
01:59:49,801 --> 01:59:50,790
Holy Shit,
that's awesome.

2715
01:59:50,970 --> 01:59:51,900
What's going on in there?
And he goes,

2716
01:59:51,910 --> 01:59:54,120
dude,
just relaxed way to see her face.

2717
01:59:54,130 --> 01:59:55,170
I'm like,
Oh fuck.

2718
01:59:55,171 --> 01:59:58,470
So I go there and it was like facial 
hair,

2719
01:59:58,590 --> 02:00:03,590
acne.
It looked like a Mexican dude and drag 

2720
02:00:03,590 --> 02:00:05,700
her face was just.
So was it a guy or was.

2721
02:00:05,701 --> 02:00:10,701
No,
it was just a very unfortunate monster 

2722
02:00:10,701 --> 02:00:11,970
that decided to wear like from behind it
looked awesome.

2723
02:00:12,110 --> 02:00:16,470
I mean I wonder how much she works,
but we asked if we could take a photo or

2724
02:00:16,471 --> 02:00:18,200
something.
One of the comics asked like,

2725
02:00:18,300 --> 02:00:19,560
can I take a photo with your.
But you know,

2726
02:00:19,561 --> 02:00:24,561
because that's how crazy it was.
And she was like 20 bucks the price for 

2727
02:00:24,900 --> 02:00:24,990
it.

2728
02:00:27,260 --> 02:00:27,990
It's like,
you know,

2729
02:00:27,991 --> 02:00:32,991
when you take a picture with Spiderman 
over at the Hollywood bowl poster or 

2730
02:00:32,991 --> 02:00:34,200
Hollywood boulevard,
it's a donation,

2731
02:00:34,450 --> 02:00:39,450
right?
This story is that why would a hooker 

2732
02:00:39,450 --> 02:00:43,080
going into a store and try to get money 
when there's so many other hookers that 

2733
02:00:43,080 --> 02:00:43,320
go there?
Something big for free.

2734
02:00:43,760 --> 02:00:43,990
Yeah.

2735
02:00:44,440 --> 02:00:46,570
Well,
not just using the via the sunset,

2736
02:00:46,571 --> 02:00:51,190
so who does stock or sell their selves 
without being on the corner?

2737
02:00:51,250 --> 02:00:53,140
You know what I mean?
People walk by a storm like,

2738
02:00:53,290 --> 02:00:54,160
oh,
look at that girl.

2739
02:00:54,330 --> 02:00:59,330
You know there's a funny just walking 
that we're willing to suck Dick.

2740
02:01:00,500 --> 02:01:05,500
You just had a fucking pulled back.
The audit choke and fucking find out 

2741
02:01:05,500 --> 02:01:08,901
that you just need the clouds to part to
see the true color of this guy's about 

2742
02:01:10,130 --> 02:01:11,790
crazy.
Women went to the store.

2743
02:01:11,791 --> 02:01:16,791
They go in there.
I mean that'll happen that the fiber 

2744
02:01:16,791 --> 02:01:16,860
room that'll happen at the house of 
Blues.

2745
02:01:17,040 --> 02:01:20,660
That whole area is just nuts.
That very famous,

2746
02:01:20,970 --> 02:01:25,970
very vegas.
When a woman comes and she moves to La 

2747
02:01:25,970 --> 02:01:28,410
and she doesn't really know how the 
things that could happen.

2748
02:01:28,710 --> 02:01:30,960
Yeah.
The things that can happen to a woman,

2749
02:01:30,961 --> 02:01:32,640
I'm a producer,
I want to take you out to lunch.

2750
02:01:32,641 --> 02:01:37,641
Next thing you know you're getting 
fucked by eight fucking I read whatever 

2751
02:01:37,641 --> 02:01:38,880
the fuck they do,
rags or whatever.

2752
02:01:39,170 --> 02:01:44,170
It's just so weird that chances are when
you're a woman like you don't fucking 

2753
02:01:44,170 --> 02:01:44,170
know.

2754
02:01:44,170 --> 02:01:44,170
You know?
Yeah.

2755
02:01:44,170 --> 02:01:48,910
You could get lucky and wind up being 
Brooke Burke and being on dancing with 

2756
02:01:48,910 --> 02:01:51,260
the stars and making millions and 
smiling or yeah,

2757
02:01:51,261 --> 02:01:55,040
you could suck one day,
end up with a bad fucking guy that tells

2758
02:01:55,041 --> 02:01:58,090
you who's next thing that you have a kid
you here.

2759
02:01:58,220 --> 02:02:00,650
It's just amazing and the same thing.
You know,

2760
02:02:00,950 --> 02:02:03,170
it's amazing fucking crap.
Shoot man.

2761
02:02:03,410 --> 02:02:04,550
For a woman,
it's way harder,

2762
02:02:04,580 --> 02:02:09,580
especially a woman trying to be a hot 
chick like I'm trying to be a 

2763
02:02:09,580 --> 02:02:12,821
professional hot check.
Try and be an actress or something like 

2764
02:02:12,821 --> 02:02:13,430
that.
Like so many of them in the volume.

2765
02:02:13,431 --> 02:02:18,431
The numbers for every Gig that there is,
the number of pretty girls that are 

2766
02:02:18,431 --> 02:02:21,410
driving in on buses and Lee especially 
now with the economy socking,

2767
02:02:21,530 --> 02:02:22,430
how many of them were like,
look,

2768
02:02:22,431 --> 02:02:24,560
there's nothing here for me.
I'm just going to give it a chance.

2769
02:02:25,370 --> 02:02:27,920
Just getting that bus and flying off to 
Hollywood.

2770
02:02:28,710 --> 02:02:30,020
Woo.
Amazing.

2771
02:02:30,680 --> 02:02:35,680
Ah,
well you and I have been here for so 

2772
02:02:35,680 --> 02:02:37,901
long now.
We've kind of seen how weird it is to 

2773
02:02:37,901 --> 02:02:39,110
watch people arrive at facebook from 
girls that you're like,

2774
02:02:39,230 --> 02:02:44,230
oh my God,
what the fuck happened to you six years 

2775
02:02:44,230 --> 02:02:49,031
ago?
You were sucking dicks behind the store 

2776
02:02:49,031 --> 02:02:49,090
and now you're a mom in Florida.
Yeah.

2777
02:02:50,110 --> 02:02:51,770
To get like,
hey joey,

2778
02:02:51,980 --> 02:02:54,510
I don't know if you're remember me and 
you look at the picture on facebook.

2779
02:02:54,520 --> 02:02:55,340
You're like,
oh my God,

2780
02:02:55,341 --> 02:02:57,770
she's got like a crib and she always 
looks so much.

2781
02:02:59,600 --> 02:03:03,590
They always look way more beat than live
in the porn star pimp lifestyle.

2782
02:03:03,591 --> 02:03:06,500
You are relaxed all the time.
You know,

2783
02:03:06,830 --> 02:03:09,380
you see him and they have 17 steps so 
far today,

2784
02:03:09,590 --> 02:03:14,590
but that day I ran into so many crazy 
fucking women and men to men,

2785
02:03:15,680 --> 02:03:16,460
men,
women,

2786
02:03:16,461 --> 02:03:16,940
everything.

2787
02:03:16,950 --> 02:03:18,560
That store was the,
it was a,

2788
02:03:18,561 --> 02:03:23,561
it was an attractor and it still is an 
attractor of crazy people comes up to 

2789
02:03:23,561 --> 02:03:24,750
you and says,
can I talk to you for is negative,

2790
02:03:25,430 --> 02:03:28,890
you know,
you get funny and you know,

2791
02:03:28,970 --> 02:03:30,950
I just wanted to be funny and they won't
give me spots.

2792
02:03:30,980 --> 02:03:33,680
What do I have to do to get spotted?
And that's the magic answer.

2793
02:03:34,040 --> 02:03:35,660
When they just say that to you,
what are they doing?

2794
02:03:35,661 --> 02:03:38,060
Guest spots and try to beat around the 
bush.

2795
02:03:38,061 --> 02:03:40,220
Well,
you could write jokes,

2796
02:03:40,880 --> 02:03:43,610
you could go to a standup class or you 
can suck my dick.

2797
02:03:43,640 --> 02:03:46,750
You know what I'm saying?
Like you got three options and say,

2798
02:03:46,920 --> 02:03:47,990
oh my God,
it's.

2799
02:03:48,310 --> 02:03:50,780
You had the one girl you talked about in
the podcast and said,

2800
02:03:50,781 --> 02:03:55,781
the less of message,
I would send a letter about how your 

2801
02:03:55,781 --> 02:03:55,781
broker a broker.

2802
02:03:55,781 --> 02:03:57,980
And I didn't mean to break us.
She was always willing to suck my dick.

2803
02:03:57,981 --> 02:04:02,510
So what am I going remember with dirty 
fingernails when night me going,

2804
02:04:02,511 --> 02:04:05,240
this is terrible like this and that 
little bathroom.

2805
02:04:05,241 --> 02:04:10,241
The cubicle on the second floor.
Remember the one by the phone where you 

2806
02:04:10,241 --> 02:04:13,361
answer that totally.
How many fucking blow jobs that you get 

2807
02:04:13,361 --> 02:04:15,971
an ad from women that just said,
if you suck my Dick when you put me on 

2808
02:04:15,971 --> 02:04:15,971
the belly room,
show with you next week.

2809
02:04:15,971 --> 02:04:20,420
Hey,
call me and they'll just suck your dick 

2810
02:04:20,420 --> 02:04:21,020
for a fucking spot.
Like in the belly room.

2811
02:04:21,021 --> 02:04:24,390
Like a fucking Steven Soderbergh.
He's going to fucking show up to the.

2812
02:04:24,680 --> 02:04:26,540
And if they only knew about Mike 
Young's,

2813
02:04:26,541 --> 02:04:30,240
just showcase.
It's just a player.

2814
02:04:30,590 --> 02:04:33,440
It's just fucking amazing.
Out Women would fall.

2815
02:04:33,620 --> 02:04:38,620
I started going on acting class and you 
book something and a girl sees you in 

2816
02:04:38,620 --> 02:04:38,620
acting class.

2817
02:04:38,620 --> 02:04:39,090
Oh my God.
They're all over you outside.

2818
02:04:39,350 --> 02:04:42,120
Like what do we need to do?
What do I mean when you start sucking my

2819
02:04:42,121 --> 02:04:45,300
dick or show me your pussy or something.
You don't have any fucking victims.

2820
02:04:45,301 --> 02:04:47,250
I had that with confused from acting 
class.

2821
02:04:48,470 --> 02:04:52,710
Why?
Actually when I was 415 pounds,

2822
02:04:52,711 --> 02:04:57,711
like in 98,
I had this 21 year old let me come over 

2823
02:04:57,711 --> 02:04:59,070
and fucking in the ass and I would fuck 
him and he asked him feel guilty.

2824
02:04:59,071 --> 02:05:01,410
Like,
when is she going to realize I'm a fat,

2825
02:05:01,411 --> 02:05:03,500
disgusting slot?
This chicken was like,

2826
02:05:03,540 --> 02:05:05,150
right.
Staying on that SUV,

2827
02:05:05,190 --> 02:05:07,020
taking the garbage out.
Let me suck your Dick.

2828
02:05:07,680 --> 02:05:09,410
You hold.
I'm a fucking Costar.

2829
02:05:09,700 --> 02:05:14,700
You know what I'm saying?
You got to hold out for the big fucking 

2830
02:05:14,700 --> 02:05:14,700
star.
She was sucking Dick.

2831
02:05:14,700 --> 02:05:16,620
What is wrong with you?
$1,200

2832
02:05:16,850 --> 02:05:21,850
for the fucking day.
Just sucking my Dick like I'm some 

2833
02:05:21,850 --> 02:05:21,850
stock.

2834
02:05:21,850 --> 02:05:21,850
I mean,
she was serious.

2835
02:05:21,850 --> 02:05:22,740
She was like,
you have some girl that you were,

2836
02:05:22,850 --> 02:05:26,070
you,
you were getting in your acting class.

2837
02:05:26,340 --> 02:05:31,340
That was also someone else.
Someone was taking care of her.

2838
02:05:31,950 --> 02:05:33,290
I don't know if he could say the guy's 
name.

2839
02:05:33,320 --> 02:05:34,940
He had a black girl.
Yeah.

2840
02:05:34,950 --> 02:05:35,650
Yeah.
We'll say it.

2841
02:05:35,670 --> 02:05:38,970
I don't give a fuck.
The Nero Nero had done.

2842
02:05:38,971 --> 02:05:43,971
Everyone's got like these black chicks 
that he takes right from like south 

2843
02:05:43,971 --> 02:05:45,420
Florida.
You're going to Florida.

2844
02:05:45,540 --> 02:05:50,540
Those black chicks are raw,
like go to Orlando and put those black 

2845
02:05:50,540 --> 02:05:55,050
chicks are mined from pumping out.
They have no fucking Afro Sheen that had

2846
02:05:55,051 --> 02:05:58,830
just goes up like Joe and Ahmed trading.
They got fucking tattoos.

2847
02:05:58,831 --> 02:06:01,530
That little heavy.
This girl that Deniro had,

2848
02:06:01,860 --> 02:06:03,990
he fixed her up.
He gave a fake tits.

2849
02:06:04,170 --> 02:06:07,620
He take away on her tattoos.
He gave her the real hair.

2850
02:06:07,621 --> 02:06:12,621
He bought that horse has she had this 
shit and he put her up in the fucking 

2851
02:06:12,621 --> 02:06:14,440
thing with Shaq lift and that's how we 
got the toddler.

2852
02:06:14,820 --> 02:06:15,930
What made you move?
Like,

2853
02:06:15,931 --> 02:06:17,230
you know,
sometimes an acting class.

2854
02:06:17,231 --> 02:06:22,231
They're like,
well you want to meet at a coffee shop 

2855
02:06:22,231 --> 02:06:22,231
to do scenes or they either come to your
house,

2856
02:06:22,231 --> 02:06:22,530
are you go to that house?
She said,

2857
02:06:22,531 --> 02:06:24,480
you want to come to my house?
I'll live in the Wilshire district.

2858
02:06:24,840 --> 02:06:29,840
Okay.
I didn't even know what the wish 

2859
02:06:29,840 --> 02:06:29,840
district is.
I just started driving.

2860
02:06:29,840 --> 02:06:32,811
She also had to pull off and there's a 
doorman and what the fuck is this bitch 

2861
02:06:32,811 --> 02:06:33,390
too?
And after a while,

2862
02:06:33,391 --> 02:06:38,391
one day she goes,
my boyfriend's Deniro look at the sleep 

2863
02:06:38,391 --> 02:06:41,721
apnea machine,
but she was telling me the whole story 

2864
02:06:41,721 --> 02:06:44,391
that she wouldn't see him and he would 
just call her on Friday and go get that 

2865
02:06:44,391 --> 02:06:47,510
black ass wash pop over for dinner.
And it was all over the shop.

2866
02:06:47,940 --> 02:06:49,320
How many of those do you think he has?

2867
02:06:50,220 --> 02:06:52,260
She said she knew she wasn't the only 
one.

2868
02:06:53,190 --> 02:06:58,190
That's beautiful.
And so they just do as a no questions 

2869
02:06:58,190 --> 02:07:00,730
asked policy,
no questions asked when I come to town 

2870
02:07:00,730 --> 02:07:04,040
to trim down for a long time that buck 
wheat for years because was going to 

2871
02:07:04,231 --> 02:07:07,680
western that fucking cave that.
I mean that's why he's got to keep doing

2872
02:07:07,681 --> 02:07:09,360
these movies.
And he's still in Russia.

2873
02:07:09,390 --> 02:07:12,060
Those bad ones done some terrible ones.
Bad ones now.

2874
02:07:12,061 --> 02:07:17,061
But I think now he's too old and he 
enjoy his original original wife to 

2875
02:07:18,751 --> 02:07:20,940
either heavy set black jake.
That's Kinda cute.

2876
02:07:21,360 --> 02:07:23,180
You're like at least she's got some 
pizzazz,

2877
02:07:23,190 --> 02:07:28,190
but you know,
he had a couple of freaks that he had 

2878
02:07:28,190 --> 02:07:28,190
out there.
And why not?

2879
02:07:28,190 --> 02:07:29,610
I haven't seen a movie of his.
It was good in a while.

2880
02:07:29,820 --> 02:07:34,820
It's unfortunate when you think about it
because he's the greatest actor of all 

2881
02:07:34,820 --> 02:07:34,820
time,
in my opinion.

2882
02:07:34,820 --> 02:07:38,820
One of them,
I shouldn't say the Gary Oldman's a bad 

2883
02:07:38,820 --> 02:07:38,820
motherfucker too.
There's a lot of guys that are bad about

2884
02:07:38,820 --> 02:07:41,140
Russell Crowe's bad motherfucker.
This is a lot of bad motherfuckers,

2885
02:07:41,141 --> 02:07:44,950
but you go back to like the raging bull 
days or the Cape fear days.

2886
02:07:45,130 --> 02:07:49,990
Robert Deniro was a mother fucker.
He was amazing man.

2887
02:07:50,200 --> 02:07:53,710
And he was the first guy that really 
would like change his body.

2888
02:07:54,020 --> 02:07:56,530
He gained a fuck load of weight for 
raging bull.

2889
02:07:56,531 --> 02:08:01,531
Remember,
he got in super good shape as a boxer 

2890
02:08:01,531 --> 02:08:02,050
and then he gained a lot of weight to 
play Ray Lamontagne,

2891
02:08:02,051 --> 02:08:02,500
uh,
in the,

2892
02:08:02,501 --> 02:08:03,880
in the,
in the later years.

2893
02:08:04,810 --> 02:08:07,660
That was a fucking amazing performance 
drivers.

2894
02:08:07,661 --> 02:08:11,080
Amazing performance.
If you see him in taxi driver,

2895
02:08:11,081 --> 02:08:14,800
that one scene where he goes to get 
Christopher walken and it's his turn and

2896
02:08:14,801 --> 02:08:19,801
the guy smacks,
smacks the guy back because you know 

2897
02:08:19,801 --> 02:08:19,801
you're going to die.

2898
02:08:19,801 --> 02:08:22,180
I'm gonna die anyway because we see good
fellas.

2899
02:08:22,570 --> 02:08:27,570
How good was he in goodfellows?
How good was he in Godfather to the 

2900
02:08:27,570 --> 02:08:28,280
beginning?
Yeah.

2901
02:08:29,630 --> 02:08:30,560
Yeah.
That shit.

2902
02:08:30,860 --> 02:08:34,610
And he became like,
that could be a young brand.

2903
02:08:34,710 --> 02:08:37,270
Brandon.
He really fucking had it down.

2904
02:08:37,271 --> 02:08:38,270
He was,
bro.

2905
02:08:38,280 --> 02:08:43,280
That's one of my favorite movies of all.
Godfather two is one of the most 

2906
02:08:43,280 --> 02:08:47,821
beautiful fucking.
The Guy who stole that movie for me is 

2907
02:08:47,821 --> 02:08:47,821
that fucking Guinea.
Fuck.

2908
02:08:48,040 --> 02:08:50,200
A five,
five angels.

2909
02:08:50,440 --> 02:08:55,440
The guy that no mind jot in Las Vegas.
I don't mind jot in Miami with Hyman 

2910
02:08:55,440 --> 02:08:56,530
Roth.
That guy that was fucking crazy,

2911
02:08:56,531 --> 02:08:59,620
that would always say shit,
that Pachino he was the one that uh,

2912
02:08:59,950 --> 02:09:04,950
duval made them commit suicide member.
He went to see him in jail and at the 

2913
02:09:05,950 --> 02:09:10,950
end of the Romans they have a party and 
then they slip that fucking risks and 

2914
02:09:10,950 --> 02:09:11,770
that,
that movie is a beautiful movement.

2915
02:09:11,770 --> 02:09:14,200
They go to Cuba and he tells them,
Hey,

2916
02:09:14,260 --> 02:09:16,150
I've seen something really interesting 
today.

2917
02:09:16,590 --> 02:09:18,970
I seen the rebel blow up.
And he goes,

2918
02:09:18,971 --> 02:09:19,660
well,
there's that tell you.

2919
02:09:19,661 --> 02:09:21,220
He was a soldier.
Gets paid to fight.

2920
02:09:21,900 --> 02:09:24,730
Rebel does it for free.
I don't like it.

2921
02:09:24,731 --> 02:09:25,540
I didn't.
I'm not gonna.

2922
02:09:25,600 --> 02:09:26,950
Watch the movie again.
Joe Rogan,

2923
02:09:27,220 --> 02:09:29,670
I haven't seen that movie fucking movie 
again.

2924
02:09:29,750 --> 02:09:34,750
I didn't see that on Dvr and I watched 
it about a month ago and I was blown 

2925
02:09:34,750 --> 02:09:34,750
away.
Never seen it.

2926
02:09:34,750 --> 02:09:38,510
It started on,
this is how brilliant it starts out 

2927
02:09:38,510 --> 02:09:40,890
where the mother goes to the don and 
Sicily and says,

2928
02:09:40,891 --> 02:09:42,720
you killed my husband and you killed my 
son.

2929
02:09:42,930 --> 02:09:45,390
Spared him.
He's fucking retarded.

2930
02:09:45,530 --> 02:09:47,550
You don't.
You don't like it because so many people

2931
02:09:47,551 --> 02:09:52,551
like it.
Is that one of those people are wearing 

2932
02:09:52,551 --> 02:09:52,820
God or good.
What is it called again?

2933
02:09:52,850 --> 02:09:57,850
Godfather father.
Posters in their house and they only 

2934
02:09:57,850 --> 02:09:57,850
talk about it.

2935
02:09:57,850 --> 02:09:57,850
It's like,
dude,

2936
02:09:57,850 --> 02:10:01,611
that movie came out like 20 years ago 
and you're still talking about what's a 

2937
02:10:01,611 --> 02:10:01,630
great fucking movie?
I know I get it,

2938
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:05,700
but it just wears on you.
She goes,

2939
02:10:05,701 --> 02:10:06,300
he goes,
no,

2940
02:10:06,570 --> 02:10:08,880
and he shoots the mother in front of.
I don't remember this,

2941
02:10:08,881 --> 02:10:11,040
but you're giving spoilers like a 
motherfucker,

2942
02:10:11,520 --> 02:10:12,660
bro.
He shoots the mother.

2943
02:10:13,020 --> 02:10:14,900
Then he goes to Ellis island.
He's alone.

2944
02:10:14,920 --> 02:10:16,770
This world,
he's fucking retarded.

2945
02:10:16,771 --> 02:10:18,590
He had,
he had yellow fever when he came from.

2946
02:10:18,720 --> 02:10:20,480
I don't remember this,
this neighborhood,

2947
02:10:20,730 --> 02:10:23,490
but the whole is when he goes back to 
Sicily,

2948
02:10:24,370 --> 02:10:27,450
he becomes Vito Corleone.
He's got dog olive oil company.

2949
02:10:27,720 --> 02:10:30,420
He goes back to Cici to get the guy who 
steals,

2950
02:10:30,480 --> 02:10:32,910
who kills his mother,
his father and his brother,

2951
02:10:33,140 --> 02:10:38,140
and he goes up to 1000 in the stomach 
and he fucking rubs his blood on his 

2952
02:10:38,871 --> 02:10:41,450
shirt.
That fucking acting.

2953
02:10:42,220 --> 02:10:43,430
Think about that scene.
He goes,

2954
02:10:43,450 --> 02:10:46,960
we'll talk a little closer.
I can ignore number to get a plan.

2955
02:10:46,970 --> 02:10:47,570
He goes,
really,

2956
02:10:47,571 --> 02:10:50,350
motherfucker,
this is the thing and this is for you,

2957
02:10:50,351 --> 02:10:55,351
and he stabs him.
Then he wipes the knife on his fucking 

2958
02:10:55,351 --> 02:10:55,351
shirt.
You mother fucker.

2959
02:10:55,640 --> 02:10:58,070
You motherfucker killing my family,
bitch.

2960
02:10:58,190 --> 02:11:00,590
He went back to the boat,
took care of business.

2961
02:11:00,890 --> 02:11:02,060
What's a good one?
I just don't know.

2962
02:11:02,061 --> 02:11:03,800
I remember that.
I do remember that part.

2963
02:11:03,830 --> 02:11:05,690
The same people that like these movies 
always have,

2964
02:11:05,691 --> 02:11:08,000
like the ringtone is somebody in the 
rack pack also.

2965
02:11:08,530 --> 02:11:10,670
You know what?
Like Dean Martin,

2966
02:11:12,150 --> 02:11:17,150
is that what it is that with frank 
stallone likes to work out to music?

2967
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:18,650
No,
it does.

2968
02:11:18,670 --> 02:11:20,390
It does.
He try to put it on a Justin's?

2969
02:11:20,450 --> 02:11:23,270
Yes.
What kind of music is he saying?

2970
02:11:23,370 --> 02:11:27,090
Album of coverage.
Is it good shark bites?

2971
02:11:27,600 --> 02:11:30,910
I need this.
I need for you to sing this song.

2972
02:11:31,260 --> 02:11:33,160
I've heard 30 million fucking times.
Yeah.

2973
02:11:33,190 --> 02:11:34,550
That's not necessary at all.
No,

2974
02:11:34,990 --> 02:11:36,960
he's on Lemon Jello.
I don't need that shit.

2975
02:11:37,030 --> 02:11:38,420
Peter.
Who people want me to jail.

2976
02:11:38,421 --> 02:11:40,570
That was the biggest scam of all life.
Peter Lemon,

2977
02:11:40,700 --> 02:11:42,840
lemon gentleman in the seventies,
just marketing group.

2978
02:11:42,841 --> 02:11:45,660
Wanted to try something and they took a 
fucking guy.

2979
02:11:45,810 --> 02:11:47,730
His name is Peter Lemon Jello.
Good looking blonde.

2980
02:11:47,731 --> 02:11:50,670
Guy took his picture and one on every 
station and said,

2981
02:11:50,671 --> 02:11:52,860
get the greatest hits of Peter Lemon 
Jello.

2982
02:11:52,890 --> 02:11:53,330
Nobody.
No.

2983
02:11:53,360 --> 02:11:54,090
Pick the lemon.
Jello.

2984
02:11:54,091 --> 02:11:55,550
Watch what the fuck's be the lemon 
Jello,

2985
02:11:55,950 --> 02:11:57,780
but those are his greatest hits by the 
fucking thing.

2986
02:11:57,781 --> 02:12:00,150
He sold like a million copies.
Nobody knew what it was.

2987
02:12:00,151 --> 02:12:04,080
An album of just covers him singing 
merry Christmas and silent night.

2988
02:12:04,081 --> 02:12:04,950
Peter Lemon,
Jello.

2989
02:12:05,190 --> 02:12:07,290
He was one album.
Made him in the seventies,

2990
02:12:07,291 --> 02:12:09,770
if you will,
on TV marketing.

2991
02:12:09,810 --> 02:12:12,570
How much it's changed.
I think there's a media marketing.

2992
02:12:12,600 --> 02:12:15,930
How much has changed in the seventies?
Guy would go on TV.

2993
02:12:15,931 --> 02:12:17,610
The greatest hits,
they didn't have that much.

2994
02:12:17,880 --> 02:12:18,930
Right.
So you went back.

2995
02:12:19,170 --> 02:12:24,170
Well,
how about when they tried to sell that 

2996
02:12:24,170 --> 02:12:24,170
dude who was playing the flute,
the Pan Flute,

2997
02:12:24,170 --> 02:12:26,710
master of the pamphlet.
What was his name?

2998
02:12:26,720 --> 02:12:29,300
Sam Fear.
Zen Masters.

2999
02:12:30,820 --> 02:12:34,510
Get the fuck.
It's amazing that that has any effect on

3000
02:12:34,511 --> 02:12:36,190
you at all.
You're sitting at home slack,

3001
02:12:36,191 --> 02:12:38,920
jaw and there's a dude playing the flute
and you're like,

3002
02:12:39,180 --> 02:12:40,630
fucking pamphlet.
I got to get that.

3003
02:12:42,340 --> 02:12:47,340
Oh fuck.
You Know Brittany Spears sells 10 

3004
02:12:47,340 --> 02:12:47,340
million ounce.

3005
02:12:48,190 --> 02:12:50,710
Yeah,
but at least that's like pop music.

3006
02:12:50,711 --> 02:12:55,711
Do you kind of get.
There's a lot of dumb teenagers out 

3007
02:12:55,711 --> 02:12:55,711
there.
Sort of connects with the type of people

3008
02:12:55,711 --> 02:12:59,320
that want frivolous dance music,
but I don't get the pamphlet.

3009
02:13:00,260 --> 02:13:04,030
There's a bunch of dudes would do like 
different master of the right.

3010
02:13:04,060 --> 02:13:09,060
Yeah.
And they sell them like in meditation 

3011
02:13:09,060 --> 02:13:11,911
places also fear.
I bet a lot of dudes are pissed that he 

3012
02:13:11,911 --> 02:13:15,100
got that master of the pamphlet contract
because you know,

3013
02:13:15,130 --> 02:13:20,130
I mean,
how many dudes were playing the pan 

3014
02:13:20,130 --> 02:13:20,130
flute going one day?
That's going to pan out.

3015
02:13:20,130 --> 02:13:20,680
The only guy panned out for was them 
fear.

3016
02:13:20,700 --> 02:13:21,880
That fear.
That's it.

3017
02:13:22,370 --> 02:13:25,770
When you pull the thing,
a trombone

3018
02:13:27,580 --> 02:13:32,580
slide,
slide whistle thing that you think in 

3019
02:13:32,580 --> 02:13:32,810
that Russell probably placed in this 
home,

3020
02:13:34,490 --> 02:13:35,350
what would you say,
please?

3021
02:13:35,360 --> 02:13:37,140
This slide was.
It looks like he would.

3022
02:13:37,650 --> 02:13:38,730
I'm sorry.
I'm just bitter with him.

3023
02:13:38,910 --> 02:13:40,500
You don't like Russell brand?
He said,

3024
02:13:40,560 --> 02:13:42,750
Katie,
is that what it is?

3025
02:13:42,760 --> 02:13:43,900
You're upset about that.
Really?

3026
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:47,850
Why are you a fan of Katy Perry?
I Love Katy Perry.

3027
02:13:47,930 --> 02:13:49,140
Do.
If you had a chance,

3028
02:13:49,141 --> 02:13:51,210
would you be with her?
Of course I would do lover.

3029
02:13:51,240 --> 02:13:53,510
I want to marry her.
So you upset at Russell?

3030
02:13:53,640 --> 02:13:57,780
I obviously didn't work out.
Yeah it but don't get fucking married.

3031
02:13:58,530 --> 02:14:00,900
Russell brand.
He's also supposedly,

3032
02:14:00,960 --> 02:14:02,130
he's English.
He's Dick.

3033
02:14:02,131 --> 02:14:06,810
Smells like shit.
He's got fucked up teeth and he's trying

3034
02:14:06,811 --> 02:14:11,811
to fuck her in the neck.
That goes to 26 year old girl from 

3035
02:14:11,811 --> 02:14:11,811
fucking up north.
She's a good girl.

3036
02:14:12,630 --> 02:14:17,630
Good girl.
And you treated her bad that she's 

3037
02:14:19,070 --> 02:14:20,070
fucking singer,
man.

3038
02:14:20,070 --> 02:14:22,980
She's a famous singer.
How do you know she's not crazy?

3039
02:14:23,130 --> 02:14:24,660
Yeah.
It might be just like a female comic.

3040
02:14:24,661 --> 02:14:29,661
She just wants to talk about her songs 
all day and publicists and maybe she's 

3041
02:14:29,661 --> 02:14:29,661
nuts.
You don't know.

3042
02:14:29,661 --> 02:14:31,290
She comes in and puts that shit.
Don't,

3043
02:14:31,350 --> 02:14:32,490
don't play that role.
Brian,

3044
02:14:32,491 --> 02:14:34,590
how dare you.
He uses the word telly.

3045
02:14:35,280 --> 02:14:37,710
Telly.
I liked when I say proper,

3046
02:14:38,220 --> 02:14:40,080
it's a proper love.
Russell restaurant.

3047
02:14:40,081 --> 02:14:41,650
He's an animal.
He's a proper funnels.

3048
02:14:42,260 --> 02:14:44,020
He's 30 years old.
He's 50,

3049
02:14:45,020 --> 02:14:47,520
50,
50 fucking years.

3050
02:14:47,521 --> 02:14:52,521
You don't need to look really planners 
or did a lot of drugs.

3051
02:14:55,320 --> 02:14:59,000
There's a lot of drugs.
He's afraid you can't do nothing.

3052
02:15:00,570 --> 02:15:03,060
Nothing bothered me.
I like to get together.

3053
02:15:03,120 --> 02:15:06,090
You let what you like to watch.
That piece of shit.

3054
02:15:06,280 --> 02:15:09,300
Why don't you watch your original one?
The original one?

3055
02:15:09,301 --> 02:15:10,160
The original ones.
Great.

3056
02:15:10,190 --> 02:15:12,300
There was no reason that we make that 
original is great.

3057
02:15:12,770 --> 02:15:15,390
There's no reason to make it,
but they did a pretty good job.

3058
02:15:15,950 --> 02:15:20,950
It was a good movie.
See the same exact character that he's 

3059
02:15:20,950 --> 02:15:20,950
in in every single day.
Pretty much,

3060
02:15:20,950 --> 02:15:23,370
but that's okay.
So is a fucking Jason Bateman or not?

3061
02:15:23,400 --> 02:15:25,110
It was the name.
What the fuck's his name?

3062
02:15:25,380 --> 02:15:26,110
The,
the,

3063
02:15:26,610 --> 02:15:28,320
the guy from the,
the uh,

3064
02:15:28,350 --> 02:15:30,780
the balding guy from England,
Justin.

3065
02:15:31,420 --> 02:15:36,360
Oh God damn the mechanic there.
Jason.

3066
02:15:36,740 --> 02:15:37,650
Jason,
Jason,

3067
02:15:38,660 --> 02:15:39,520
Jason say that.
Sorry.

3068
02:15:39,530 --> 02:15:40,860
Sorry.
Sorry.

3069
02:15:40,861 --> 02:15:42,920
About a month ago to a mechanic isn't.
There's nothing.

3070
02:15:43,830 --> 02:15:44,760
I said to myself,

3071
02:15:44,790 --> 02:15:47,550
you know what,
how can I put down a movie?

3072
02:15:47,551 --> 02:15:52,551
I haven't seen a.
and let me just take the Charles Branch 

3073
02:15:52,551 --> 02:15:52,770
and notion off.
It might be a good movie,

3074
02:15:53,060 --> 02:15:54,850
right?
Are you fucking kidding me?

3075
02:15:54,890 --> 02:15:56,900
Just get mad at it.
Oh,

3076
02:15:57,790 --> 02:16:00,340
he minutes in because that's the beauty 
of the mechanic.

3077
02:16:00,341 --> 02:16:02,290
If you watch the original mechanic,
it's the beginning.

3078
02:16:02,680 --> 02:16:07,680
It's the longest dragged out scene of 
all time and it's one of the best hitch 

3079
02:16:07,680 --> 02:16:10,951
you'll ever see on film where he breaks 
into the guy's house and puts you to 

3080
02:16:10,951 --> 02:16:12,580
sleep and peace to a pills and the Dang.
And,

3081
02:16:12,820 --> 02:16:15,070
and what he does is he puts the gas on a
shooter,

3082
02:16:15,110 --> 02:16:17,380
so it looks like a fire.
He did a very.

3083
02:16:17,381 --> 02:16:19,480
And that's what I told people at the 
mechanic,

3084
02:16:19,481 --> 02:16:24,481
wasn't about a guy blowing up things.
It was about a 51 year old man that has 

3085
02:16:24,481 --> 02:16:28,661
to use his trades and he did everything.
He didn't want it to seem like he was 

3086
02:16:28,661 --> 02:16:29,250
shooting.
It wasn't a fucking act like,

3087
02:16:29,290 --> 02:16:30,040
you know,
if he would look

3088
02:16:30,040 --> 02:16:35,040
at your medical records,
if you had a weak heart each shoot at 

3089
02:16:35,040 --> 02:16:35,040
your legs,
so you would have to run.

3090
02:16:35,040 --> 02:16:36,580
That's how he killed Jeremiah.
Michael Vincent's father in that movie.

3091
02:16:36,940 --> 02:16:39,070
I watched that thing with Jason Strand,
Bro.

3092
02:16:39,160 --> 02:16:40,270
No,
no.

3093
02:16:40,360 --> 02:16:43,010
Fifteen minutes.
It went right off.

3094
02:16:43,620 --> 02:16:46,980
It was a little too stylized and like 
the fight scenes like that.

3095
02:16:48,140 --> 02:16:50,860
Vincent was trotting slams much.
Jen might go.

3096
02:16:50,861 --> 02:16:55,861
Vincent was a cool mother fucker walking
into the room.

3097
02:16:56,200 --> 02:17:01,200
Microphone jobs.
Bronson was a cool motherfucker walking 

3098
02:17:01,200 --> 02:17:02,410
into the scene and I think that guy that
played jam,

3099
02:17:02,411 --> 02:17:05,380
Michael vintage rolls are good fucking.
He's a great actor,

3100
02:17:05,740 --> 02:17:07,870
but he overdid the role.
Really?

3101
02:17:07,990 --> 02:17:09,820
Yes.
The role wasn't for a kid.

3102
02:17:09,821 --> 02:17:14,821
That was crazy.
It was for a kid that was spoiled to 

3103
02:17:14,821 --> 02:17:18,661
different vinyl.
Maybe they played it crazy in this 

3104
02:17:18,661 --> 02:17:18,661
movie.
You know when you're spoiled,

3105
02:17:18,661 --> 02:17:20,080
when you're spoiled kid and your parents
have a lot of money,

3106
02:17:20,120 --> 02:17:20,860
you're spoiled like that.

3107
02:17:21,130 --> 02:17:22,720
That's what he was,
you know,

3108
02:17:22,810 --> 02:17:26,410
he was a bad ass in 30 days of night.
Who's that guy?

3109
02:17:26,411 --> 02:17:31,411
That same guy that played the Jan Marini
is great and he's a good actor.

3110
02:17:32,321 --> 02:17:34,270
I don't want them to remake and Charles 
Bronson movie.

3111
02:17:34,610 --> 02:17:35,760
No,
you know,

3112
02:17:35,900 --> 02:17:40,900
no matter what you do,
it's like you don't have to remake the 

3113
02:17:40,900 --> 02:17:40,900
movie man.
How much?

3114
02:17:40,900 --> 02:17:41,320
Just make another movie about a young 
man.

3115
02:17:41,350 --> 02:17:42,370
Why can't I hit?
Why?

3116
02:17:42,400 --> 02:17:43,990
Yeah.
Why can't you make another movie about a

3117
02:17:43,991 --> 02:17:46,600
Hitman and just cause you guys rolling 
in his grave.

3118
02:17:46,601 --> 02:17:49,020
You worked hard to be a scumbag.
And Austin,

3119
02:17:49,030 --> 02:17:54,030
this guy comes with his pretty face and 
shaved head and all of a sudden he's 

3120
02:17:54,030 --> 02:17:54,360
fucking shooting people by my fuck you.
Fuck you.

3121
02:17:54,510 --> 02:17:58,810
Fuck you.
Says what's up Joe Rogan go this week.

3122
02:17:59,010 --> 02:18:02,980
Italian beef sandwiches.
It's going to be off the fucking chain.

3123
02:18:03,220 --> 02:18:05,710
The only ticket to the left folks are 
nosebleeds.

3124
02:18:05,770 --> 02:18:07,570
Are you serious?
So I was left.

3125
02:18:07,680 --> 02:18:09,400
People know the way back,
I guess is a,

3126
02:18:09,401 --> 02:18:13,240
it's a giant place with.
It's like 3000,

3127
02:18:13,241 --> 02:18:15,460
200 people or something like that.
It's huge.

3128
02:18:15,850 --> 02:18:18,160
People driving from Canada.
I'm going to have some fucking fun.

3129
02:18:18,220 --> 02:18:20,950
We're selling.
We made posters to Mike Maxwell.

3130
02:18:21,810 --> 02:18:23,880
He's a,
he's a serious fucking real deal.

3131
02:18:24,280 --> 02:18:28,370
My Art Dot Com is a bad motherfucker.
And Matt,

3132
02:18:28,410 --> 02:18:30,220
Mike Maxwell,
art on twitter,

3133
02:18:30,270 --> 02:18:32,040
that's his twitter handle.
And he's uh,

3134
02:18:32,050 --> 02:18:34,930
he's coming with us and he's going to 
sign some posters too if you want to get

3135
02:18:34,931 --> 02:18:37,060
your shit signed and we'll all sign it.
Wall side.

3136
02:18:37,650 --> 02:18:41,440
Get one brother ones when these crazy.
We're going to have some fun.

3137
02:18:41,441 --> 02:18:42,550
It's a killer.
Pop.

3138
02:18:42,650 --> 02:18:47,650
The card is sick man.
There's a lot of good fights of the 

3139
02:18:47,650 --> 02:18:47,710
bisping Chael Sonnen fighting already 
talked about.

3140
02:18:47,920 --> 02:18:51,460
Rashad Evans is going to take on Phil 
Davis.

3141
02:18:51,461 --> 02:18:52,200
That's a good fucking.

3142
02:18:52,210 --> 02:18:53,920
I find.
I like that fight a lot.

3143
02:18:54,130 --> 02:18:55,870
That's a really interesting fucking 
fight.

3144
02:18:56,020 --> 02:18:59,050
And Damien Maia is going to take on 
Chris Weidman.

3145
02:18:59,110 --> 02:19:00,020
That's a good fight,
right?

3146
02:19:00,030 --> 02:19:01,600
And they took that fight on short 
notice,

3147
02:19:01,601 --> 02:19:05,410
but that kid's a stud wrestler.
Who knows how to put people to sleep,

3148
02:19:05,610 --> 02:19:10,610
you know,
he put Tom Law to sleep in the fucking 

3149
02:19:10,610 --> 02:19:11,020
with darce choke killer.
He's a killer.

3150
02:19:11,230 --> 02:19:15,460
And you know what?
Matt Serra is a serious Jujitsu coach.

3151
02:19:15,461 --> 02:19:17,830
You know,
a lot of people don't remember that Matt

3152
02:19:17,830 --> 02:19:22,830
Serra was at one point in time when he 
was competing and just straight 

3153
02:19:22,830 --> 02:19:25,270
grappling was right up there at the top 
of the fucking heap.

3154
02:19:25,390 --> 02:19:27,830
He wanted decision over John John 
Machado,

3155
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:28,580
you know,
I mean,

3156
02:19:28,581 --> 02:19:31,190
he submitted a lot of fucking really 
good dudes.

3157
02:19:31,191 --> 02:19:36,191
Sarah was a killer and just straight 
Jujitsu back when he was only competing 

3158
02:19:37,191 --> 02:19:39,830
in Jiu Jitsu before he.
When you get into mixed martial arts,

3159
02:19:39,980 --> 02:19:40,930
of course you have to.

3160
02:19:41,050 --> 02:19:46,050
You have to dedicate so much time to 
striking so much of your time to 

3161
02:19:46,050 --> 02:19:49,151
conditioning so much of your time to do 
all these different things that you 

3162
02:19:49,151 --> 02:19:49,610
know,
your Jujitsu game doesn't get to express

3163
02:19:49,611 --> 02:19:50,660
itself the ways,
you know.

3164
02:19:50,720 --> 02:19:53,900
He's getting involved in a lot of stand 
up fights and you know,

3165
02:19:54,020 --> 02:19:59,020
sometimes dudes like they,
one guy will take it down and hold onto 

3166
02:19:59,020 --> 02:20:03,910
you.
It's you don't get to see it as if like 

3167
02:20:03,910 --> 02:20:07,210
it was a straight Jujitsu match where 
one guy only trying to submit you and 

3168
02:20:07,210 --> 02:20:10,841
you're trying to submit him.
Then you get to really see a guy's 

3169
02:20:10,841 --> 02:20:12,920
Jujitsu and Matt Serra has some fucking 
top line Jujitsu.

3170
02:20:13,060 --> 02:20:16,040
His Jujitsu is really tight man and you 
know,

3171
02:20:16,070 --> 02:20:18,640
to have a guy like him teaching a guy 
like Weidman,

3172
02:20:18,860 --> 02:20:21,770
you know,
a guy was already fought mma many,

3173
02:20:21,771 --> 02:20:24,080
many times.
One the title,

3174
02:20:24,260 --> 02:20:24,770
you know what I mean?

3175
02:20:24,770 --> 02:20:28,490
Fought some of the best guys to have him
teaching Weidman.

3176
02:20:28,640 --> 02:20:31,760
You get a stud wrestler,
a guy who has beaten,

3177
02:20:31,820 --> 02:20:35,810
I believe he fought Phil Davis and 
rather wrestled filled Davidson,

3178
02:20:35,811 --> 02:20:38,030
beat him in a straight wrestling 
competition,

3179
02:20:38,031 --> 02:20:41,180
which is fucking crazy.
Davis is an amazing wrestler.

3180
02:20:41,870 --> 02:20:46,640
So weidman a killer wrestler and then on
top of that he's learned submissions and

3181
02:20:46,641 --> 02:20:51,641
on top of that he's just tough as fuck 
off his phone and he's all crazy with 

3182
02:20:51,641 --> 02:20:55,961
Jesus.
He's another one of those dudes that's 

3183
02:20:55,961 --> 02:20:58,440
always crazy.
Loves Jesus and he's like super 

3184
02:20:58,440 --> 02:20:58,460
religious and it's got that Jujitsu walk
hand in hand.

3185
02:20:58,461 --> 02:21:03,461
Yeah.
Will they get that mad belief in 

3186
02:21:03,461 --> 02:21:03,461
themselves?
There's something to be said for that.

3187
02:21:03,461 --> 02:21:06,821
They used to scare the shit out of me 
when I used to fight like religious 

3188
02:21:06,821 --> 02:21:06,821
guys.
I obviously think that religious guy,

3189
02:21:06,821 --> 02:21:11,111
they always made me nervous like they 
had like a kind of confidence that 

3190
02:21:11,111 --> 02:21:14,021
fucking spooked and you can't beat them 
up because you feel like they got the 

3191
02:21:14,021 --> 02:21:15,590
fucking burn for an extra fucking week.

3192
02:21:16,370 --> 02:21:17,870
I wish you could come to Brazil.
Joey.

3193
02:21:17,900 --> 02:21:20,570
They start burning.
They get a passport and started fucking.

3194
02:21:20,810 --> 02:21:22,520
You've got to get a passport.
Shit like that.

3195
02:21:22,521 --> 02:21:26,260
Fucking people had the old country 
confused to Christianity.

3196
02:21:26,261 --> 02:21:29,030
And how's that working for the Denver?
Are they still in it?

3197
02:21:29,570 --> 02:21:31,070
They ran into punches.
Pilot.

3198
02:21:31,250 --> 02:21:33,770
Who's punches pilot?
The motherfucker from England.

3199
02:21:33,771 --> 02:21:36,980
Tom Brady dumped his bitch when she was 
six months pregnant.

3200
02:21:36,981 --> 02:21:41,981
Who's that?
And not just dumped a bunch of fucking 

3201
02:21:41,981 --> 02:21:43,340
hot bitch and then jumped on the thing 
where he put the phones on.

3202
02:21:43,341 --> 02:21:48,341
Tim Teebo his fucking head last week and
this week ray Lewis went up there 

3203
02:21:48,341 --> 02:21:49,280
thinking he was going to the superbowl,
stabbed somebody else,

3204
02:21:49,281 --> 02:21:52,520
but you had a fucking stop up there too.
They didn't cover the spread,

3205
02:21:52,521 --> 02:21:53,550
but the under came

3206
02:21:53,980 --> 02:21:58,980
picker.
You see that kicker lesson and the 

3207
02:21:58,980 --> 02:21:58,980
Patriot game?
Is that what it was?

3208
02:21:58,980 --> 02:22:00,320
The giant games.
This clobbered.

3209
02:22:00,360 --> 02:22:05,360
This kicker wasn't,
didn't know you were supposed to go up 

3210
02:22:05,360 --> 02:22:05,360
or something.
I don't know what the full story is.

3211
02:22:05,360 --> 02:22:08,460
So at the last second he had to like run
and kick the ball,

3212
02:22:08,461 --> 02:22:13,461
you know,
he was like on the sidelines they 

3213
02:22:13,461 --> 02:22:14,751
couldn't find them or anything and he 
missed it and I think that was like the 

3214
02:22:14,751 --> 02:22:16,380
kick that made them lose the superbowl 
or something like that.

3215
02:22:17,220 --> 02:22:19,010
Oh my God.
You got one job to do in the kitchen.

3216
02:22:19,020 --> 02:22:22,230
And I was at that time he looked like 
suicidal and like fans were like,

3217
02:22:22,260 --> 02:22:25,170
we didn't say anything bad to him 
because he looked like he was suicidal.

3218
02:22:25,270 --> 02:22:26,100
It's like what some

3219
02:22:26,100 --> 02:22:31,100
of the quotes were saying fucking Bro.
Izzy last week.

3220
02:22:31,711 --> 02:22:33,480
Yeah,
he's a white John Jones.

3221
02:22:33,690 --> 02:22:35,400
Really?
Six,

3222
02:22:35,410 --> 02:22:37,110
five.
I didn't know that.

3223
02:22:37,170 --> 02:22:40,260
I was looking at him last week and his 
gift is his hearing.

3224
02:22:40,740 --> 02:22:45,480
He lets them come around them and swat 
at them and all of a sudden this fucking

3225
02:22:45,481 --> 02:22:48,730
dangerous because you don't even see it.
Like if I was in my going down and maybe

3226
02:22:48,731 --> 02:22:53,731
because I just am a punch.
Motherfuckers do Brady Hammer Punch 

3227
02:22:54,121 --> 02:22:54,940
right from me.
A bag.

3228
02:22:54,960 --> 02:22:56,420
You want to take me down because I had 
dated.

3229
02:22:56,720 --> 02:23:01,720
I dated a girl for my fucking thing.
I will hit you with a hammer part that 

3230
02:23:01,720 --> 02:23:01,890
will crush your skull.
Joe.

3231
02:23:01,920 --> 02:23:04,500
They're putting their hands out.
He so Paul,

3232
02:23:04,501 --> 02:23:06,200
he stands in the pocket.
You don't run.

3233
02:23:06,201 --> 02:23:11,201
They don't move and he just watches and 
all of a sudden when that dude's phone 

3234
02:23:11,201 --> 02:23:13,980
that's then comes out man.
And that motherfucker.

3235
02:23:13,980 --> 02:23:15,810
I mean he made me a believer a couple of
years ago,

3236
02:23:15,811 --> 02:23:18,150
but I was sitting on this six foot five 
bro.

3237
02:23:18,510 --> 02:23:21,240
He ain't no fucking joke that do.
When you see the guys around him,

3238
02:23:21,570 --> 02:23:24,390
he's fucking tall.
He's a big motherfucking strong.

3239
02:23:24,750 --> 02:23:25,880
I was watching him.
That's.

3240
02:23:26,670 --> 02:23:31,670
He's got some kind of place eating that 
Brazilian chip that's to give you 

3241
02:23:31,670 --> 02:23:31,770
something.
Does that help?

3242
02:23:32,060 --> 02:23:37,060
What's that?
Eating a Brazilian check made them a 

3243
02:23:37,060 --> 02:23:37,060
little crazy because she's fucking 
gotta.

3244
02:23:37,060 --> 02:23:37,450
Be Crazy.
If I was just out bumble,

3245
02:23:37,550 --> 02:23:40,360
say whatever her name is.
I did that taxi movie with her.

3246
02:23:40,361 --> 02:23:42,210
She was on the side.
I looked at that bitches ass.

3247
02:23:42,211 --> 02:23:46,350
That bitch was attend.
There was no cellulite and a future.

3248
02:23:47,060 --> 02:23:50,480
You understand me like her thighs have 
no silly Leeton her future.

3249
02:23:50,880 --> 02:23:55,320
She's never gonna have that big Brazil.
Nothing she has meant meant.

3250
02:23:55,410 --> 02:23:57,580
Meant meant her malcontents.

3251
02:23:57,600 --> 02:24:01,080
I rubbed her when she was in the pussy.
They rubbed up with fucking cocoa butter

3252
02:24:01,081 --> 02:24:05,580
or whatever the fuck bitches banging.
I get taxi with that bitch.

3253
02:24:05,640 --> 02:24:08,190
She was in a plane with us and when the 
plane landed,

3254
02:24:08,191 --> 02:24:10,640
they.
They rushed her off into a security card

3255
02:24:10,641 --> 02:24:11,590
and took her away.
Fuck.

3256
02:24:11,700 --> 02:24:15,750
You got a God that pussy pushing a box 
year round.

3257
02:24:15,780 --> 02:24:18,210
They got to have a lock and a key and 
flashlights.

3258
02:24:18,590 --> 02:24:20,010
I'll concur.
Concur.

3259
02:24:20,220 --> 02:24:25,220
Open it.
You have to let the air out of the 

3260
02:24:25,220 --> 02:24:25,220
Monkey.
That crossfit,

3261
02:24:25,220 --> 02:24:27,570
that pussy is the real deal dog.
What's next for you joe?

3262
02:24:27,571 --> 02:24:28,760
What's going on?
What do you got going on?

3263
02:24:28,761 --> 02:24:33,180
You want to promote weeks?
I got the fuck we're doing.

3264
02:24:33,470 --> 02:24:36,330
Oh,
to Vegas.

3265
02:24:36,360 --> 02:24:39,030
February third house of Blues have sold 
out already.

3266
02:24:39,031 --> 02:24:40,710
Getting on it.
Hiv Dot com.

3267
02:24:41,110 --> 02:24:42,720
You uh,
you can find it.

3268
02:24:42,721 --> 02:24:44,580
Just go see like a motherfucker.

3269
02:24:45,960 --> 02:24:49,560
It's either you or the priest.
$5 on payloads.

3270
02:24:49,770 --> 02:24:51,420
Fucking killing them.
And how do we find that?

3271
02:24:51,430 --> 02:24:53,010
How do people find the payloads?
Dotcom.

3272
02:24:53,040 --> 02:24:56,150
Payloads,
payloads with a z Dot d,

3273
02:24:56,470 --> 02:24:57,510
z.
that's it.

3274
02:24:57,900 --> 02:24:59,540
Payloads.
Diaper loads.

3275
02:24:59,700 --> 02:25:01,440
What are you going to do with all the 
lowes.com?

3276
02:25:02,080 --> 02:25:03,210
And I'll tell you what,
it was one of the,

3277
02:25:03,211 --> 02:25:08,211
you know,
when I've never fucking been good at 

3278
02:25:08,211 --> 02:25:08,211
taping anything.
Right?

3279
02:25:08,211 --> 02:25:12,801
And I've come to terms with that.
So what I did was I just bought one of 

3280
02:25:12,801 --> 02:25:13,170
those things and took me to a month of 
gigs.

3281
02:25:13,330 --> 02:25:14,520
Yeah.
Didn't say nothing.

3282
02:25:14,521 --> 02:25:16,440
Just plugged them into the boards 
really.

3283
02:25:16,530 --> 02:25:21,530
And I got a set that was so fucking good
and I got full in the middle of one of 

3284
02:25:21,530 --> 02:25:22,890
my assets because I was telling a true 
story.

3285
02:25:22,891 --> 02:25:24,160
I go,
either you or the priest

3286
02:25:24,490 --> 02:25:25,890
and Felicia,
Felicia.

3287
02:25:25,910 --> 02:25:29,080
We went to a church while they were 
doing the church service on Sunday.

3288
02:25:29,081 --> 02:25:32,110
I lankershim and we went up to the 
[inaudible] priest thing and look at the

3289
02:25:32,111 --> 02:25:34,360
album cover.
It says priest up confessional.

3290
02:25:34,660 --> 02:25:38,440
And she took a picture while they were,
you get given a priest is up there,

3291
02:25:38,660 --> 02:25:40,540
you know,
give everybody thanks and praise.

3292
02:25:40,541 --> 02:25:42,610
It was a Catholic fucking pr.
So I said,

3293
02:25:42,611 --> 02:25:44,800
you know what man?
People always asked me for Shit,

3294
02:25:45,180 --> 02:25:47,170
I'll sell it for $5 downloads,
you know?

3295
02:25:47,171 --> 02:25:49,060
And that's it.
I don't have to get it on itunes.

3296
02:25:49,270 --> 02:25:54,270
I didn't put it on itunes yet.
I'm trying to get all night to get it 

3297
02:25:54,270 --> 02:25:54,270
yet.
How do we get it on?

3298
02:25:54,270 --> 02:25:55,910
I can teach you that.
He doesn't get it.

3299
02:25:56,080 --> 02:25:57,370
Yeah,
we've got to get that on itunes.

3300
02:25:57,371 --> 02:25:59,530
We gotta make it easy to have one on 
itunes now,

3301
02:25:59,531 --> 02:26:01,830
but one live from the three of clubs at 
some men's,

3302
02:26:01,880 --> 02:26:02,430
a man's.

3303
02:26:02,440 --> 02:26:04,570
It's good,
but this one's really fun.

3304
02:26:04,600 --> 02:26:05,380
I mean,
listen,

3305
02:26:05,620 --> 02:26:10,620
I don't like watching myself watching 
myself in the beginning of general 

3306
02:26:10,620 --> 02:26:11,680
hospital and they focused on my bald 
spot.

3307
02:26:11,681 --> 02:26:16,450
I fucking turned it off.
That's all I see is on Hulu Dot com.

3308
02:26:16,451 --> 02:26:20,710
You can you see me walk in.
I can't wait.

3309
02:26:20,740 --> 02:26:22,990
You're gonna die.
You're gonna die even died.

3310
02:26:22,991 --> 02:26:24,150
I was like,
oh,

3311
02:26:24,200 --> 02:26:26,680
except for the ball spot.
Jody is a bad motherfucker.

3312
02:26:26,850 --> 02:26:29,410
You know what I'm saying?
The boss Bot was killing a brother.

3313
02:26:29,460 --> 02:26:31,360
Are you going to do more?
How many guns did wind up doing?

3314
02:26:31,390 --> 02:26:34,330
I hope that they write me back in once 
this guy sonny leaves,

3315
02:26:34,331 --> 02:26:36,700
because I really had a good time.
I got to tell I had a grilling.

3316
02:26:36,790 --> 02:26:38,260
It's me.
It's me.

3317
02:26:38,261 --> 02:26:43,261
It's easy.
There's no drama and you know where you 

3318
02:26:43,261 --> 02:26:45,121
stand.
There's no like pas telling you five 

3319
02:26:45,121 --> 02:26:45,121
minutes come up,
get changed.

3320
02:26:45,121 --> 02:26:45,550
No,
there's nothing.

3321
02:26:45,580 --> 02:26:50,580
I'm always amazed that someone that 
hasn't figured out to put you in a 

3322
02:26:50,580 --> 02:26:50,580
sitcom.
I just don't drive me crazy.

3323
02:26:50,580 --> 02:26:55,561
So cartoony.
Then you should be a voice of a cartoon 

3324
02:26:55,561 --> 02:26:59,340
adventure time.
Once they get the word's getting out 

3325
02:26:59,340 --> 02:27:00,010
that we're doing great things.
I'm going to do great things this year.

3326
02:27:00,550 --> 02:27:01,440
You know,
it's amazing.

3327
02:27:01,930 --> 02:27:03,590
Make us a cartoon.
We're going to go,

3328
02:27:03,591 --> 02:27:05,290
uh,
we're going to do a desk squad tour to.

3329
02:27:05,291 --> 02:27:08,590
We're working on that right now for the 
spring we're working on.

3330
02:27:08,620 --> 02:27:11,040
It'll be everybody that's on the 
podcast,

3331
02:27:11,070 --> 02:27:12,160
you know,
one of those things.

3332
02:27:12,161 --> 02:27:17,161
It'll be like we're trying to do one 
with already Duncan Joe and meet with a 

3333
02:27:17,161 --> 02:27:20,440
bunch of us Kreischer.
Get as many of us together as we can and

3334
02:27:20,680 --> 02:27:22,110
hit some theaters.
Just hit somebody.

3335
02:27:22,380 --> 02:27:24,690
Awesome.
One of those long ones.

3336
02:27:25,360 --> 02:27:28,090
Fucking emails this week.
And I want you to use your head people.

3337
02:27:28,300 --> 02:27:31,300
Everybody keeps saying to you guys and 
Joe going to hang out after the show.

3338
02:27:31,570 --> 02:27:32,950
Yeah,
but there's only one problem.

3339
02:27:32,951 --> 02:27:36,340
It's going to be four degrees.
So unless you had joined is fucking made

3340
02:27:36,341 --> 02:27:39,370
out of an Igloo or something or fucking 
a non freezed papers.

3341
02:27:39,371 --> 02:27:41,140
We'll meet you outside.
There's going to be three degrees.

3342
02:27:41,530 --> 02:27:44,350
Nowhere to go,
so I hope that we do post an after party

3343
02:27:44,351 --> 02:27:45,680
somewhere.
So we're gonna.

3344
02:27:45,681 --> 02:27:46,700
We're gonna.
Have a party.

3345
02:27:46,750 --> 02:27:49,000
We're going to see these people.
I want to do that thing with Pete.

3346
02:27:49,001 --> 02:27:54,001
The cop,
the cop offered us some club and I'll 

3347
02:27:54,001 --> 02:27:54,710
announce it at the uh,
at the actual shoe.

3348
02:27:56,340 --> 02:28:01,340
Yeah.
That's the best move for me to do 

3349
02:28:01,340 --> 02:28:01,340
nothing.
And that's part of the fingers.

3350
02:28:01,340 --> 02:28:04,480
These meet a lot of people though inside
when we sell the posters to find.

3351
02:28:04,520 --> 02:28:05,470
So it'll be cool,
man.

3352
02:28:05,500 --> 02:28:06,580
I'm going to feel for it.
Before you leave,

3353
02:28:06,581 --> 02:28:10,210
did you see that fucking cruise ship 
ship that sunk?

3354
02:28:10,430 --> 02:28:12,520
Do you know those people?
A bunch of people are dead.

3355
02:28:12,521 --> 02:28:17,521
At least 20 people were dead.
A bunch of people are missing or 12 

3356
02:28:17,521 --> 02:28:17,521
people are dead.
You are dead.

3357
02:28:17,521 --> 02:28:18,940
They just found two or three more bodies
last night.

3358
02:28:18,941 --> 02:28:20,860
They're exploding a holes in it to 
today.

3359
02:28:20,861 --> 02:28:21,980
You can get to more places

3360
02:28:21,980 --> 02:28:23,270
to find them.
And I think there's 15.

3361
02:28:23,550 --> 02:28:28,550
Well,
the cruise ship company started calling 

3362
02:28:28,550 --> 02:28:31,281
up the passengers saying that they would
offer them 30 percent off their next 

3363
02:28:32,221 --> 02:28:34,020
vacation with them.
That's nice.

3364
02:28:34,050 --> 02:28:38,320
That's a great discount code.
That's I imagine people that have jumped

3365
02:28:38,340 --> 02:28:41,010
into the ocean to save their lives with 
their children.

3366
02:28:41,040 --> 02:28:46,040
They should get free cruise for life.
How would you imagine fucking cruise 

3367
02:28:46,040 --> 02:28:47,280
ship ever again?
Fucking paid me.

3368
02:28:47,460 --> 02:28:50,190
I went on one time to the cruise to 
nowhere in New York.

3369
02:28:50,191 --> 02:28:54,060
Twenty four hours.
I knew that shit wasn't trap.

3370
02:28:54,150 --> 02:28:55,580
I don't like it at all.
Oh,

3371
02:28:55,581 --> 02:28:57,060
they got great food.
They got nothing.

3372
02:28:57,061 --> 02:29:00,880
They got fucking all you can eat and you
gotta you gotta go out to the gallery.

3373
02:29:00,881 --> 02:29:02,010
The smoke dope.
No,

3374
02:29:02,040 --> 02:29:02,270
no,
no.

3375
02:29:02,640 --> 02:29:07,640
Just leading me on dry fucking land.
Anthony to Mia likes going on cruises 

3376
02:29:07,640 --> 02:29:08,580
doesn't mean.
I don't know.

3377
02:29:08,670 --> 02:29:11,430
I think he likes just going and getting 
hammered and going on cruises.

3378
02:29:11,910 --> 02:29:12,690
I hate you.
I don't.

3379
02:29:12,780 --> 02:29:14,670
I can't get it.
But the captain,

3380
02:29:14,880 --> 02:29:16,710
the captain is totally to blame.
Apparently.

3381
02:29:16,711 --> 02:29:19,290
Just drove it into the rocks.
This crazy.

3382
02:29:19,291 --> 02:29:19,670
Yeah.
So.

3383
02:29:19,671 --> 02:29:23,400
And he jumped off for four hours before 
the last passenger got off.

3384
02:29:23,700 --> 02:29:26,050
This asshole was off.
Took her.

3385
02:29:26,160 --> 02:29:29,520
He just took off.
He crashed the fucking boat.

3386
02:29:29,550 --> 02:29:30,930
Could you imagine you,
you,

3387
02:29:30,950 --> 02:29:35,950
you know,
you spend billions of dollars and your 

3388
02:29:35,950 --> 02:29:37,521
cruise line keeping everything 
maintained perfect and some asshole 

3389
02:29:37,521 --> 02:29:39,170
drives your big and supposedly bus into 
a rock

3390
02:29:39,250 --> 02:29:43,900
and supposedly it was like something 
that same path that he did every day for

3391
02:29:43,901 --> 02:29:48,901
years,
but he got bored and said there was one 

3392
02:29:48,901 --> 02:29:49,130
part where you just wanted to do 
something different because you know,

3393
02:29:49,510 --> 02:29:51,840
and so you went to a different way that 
you really.

3394
02:29:51,850 --> 02:29:53,530
Yeah,
because you can track it.

3395
02:29:53,531 --> 02:29:57,670
You can track the crews on this website 
to see where boats go every single day.

3396
02:29:57,910 --> 02:29:59,480
Imagine the audacity of

3397
02:29:59,620 --> 02:30:02,020
company to call you just a few days 
after,

3398
02:30:02,200 --> 02:30:04,300
you know people lost loved ones.
People.

3399
02:30:04,301 --> 02:30:09,301
There's people missing still too,
for a company to have the audacity to 

3400
02:30:09,301 --> 02:30:10,180
call you up and say,
hey,

3401
02:30:10,181 --> 02:30:15,181
we're going to offer you 30 percent off 
your next cruise just because we want 

3402
02:30:15,181 --> 02:30:18,631
you to.
You know what the price of that cruise 

3403
02:30:18,631 --> 02:30:18,670
that you just almost died in.
We're going to fuck it.

3404
02:30:18,671 --> 02:30:20,020
Throw that out the window.
How about that?

3405
02:30:20,021 --> 02:30:21,720
We're going to race that.
We're going to get like,

3406
02:30:21,730 --> 02:30:24,220
they're so delusional.
They think they're so detached,

3407
02:30:24,221 --> 02:30:27,010
they think those people are ever going 
to get on a fucking cruise again.

3408
02:30:28,220 --> 02:30:30,070
That fuck that man,
that's you,

3409
02:30:30,100 --> 02:30:35,100
you,
you got a little piece of metal that's 

3410
02:30:35,100 --> 02:30:37,021
floating over an alien world and at any 
point in time something can happen and a

3411
02:30:37,091 --> 02:30:42,091
whole could get punctured to that thing 
and then it sinks to the bottom of that 

3412
02:30:42,091 --> 02:30:43,660
era alien world where you can't live and
then what are you in?

3413
02:30:43,690 --> 02:30:48,690
Then you're in a little floatable raft 
bobbing around in shark soup and all 

3414
02:30:48,690 --> 02:30:48,930
this time

3415
02:30:48,970 --> 02:30:52,810
this has happened when Brendan Walsh and
Doug Benson had been on this cruise ship

3416
02:30:52,811 --> 02:30:54,640
with weed and like all these bands and 
stuff.

3417
02:30:54,641 --> 02:30:57,640
This happened at the same time while 
they're online and you could know Doug's

3418
02:30:57,641 --> 02:30:59,740
probably don't as an elegant way to,
uh,

3419
02:30:59,750 --> 02:31:01,840
Doug Benson and Brendan Walsh,
or on a cruise ship.

3420
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:07,000
Yeah.
With weezer and Wean and a bunch of 

3421
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:07,000
people.
It's like a,

3422
02:31:07,050 --> 02:31:10,850
it's a weezer careers where they're just
all in this huge boat.

3423
02:31:10,851 --> 02:31:10,940
Yeah.

3424
02:31:11,190 --> 02:31:13,650
That actually sounds kind of see that,
that,

3425
02:31:13,651 --> 02:31:14,800
that made a crew sound.
All right.

3426
02:31:14,801 --> 02:31:16,150
If you can get a bunch of cool bands,

3427
02:31:16,260 --> 02:31:21,260
but you know,
imagine Doug's just being on that boat 

3428
02:31:21,260 --> 02:31:21,260
with Doug [inaudible],
you know,

3429
02:31:21,260 --> 02:31:23,040
you're probably smoking shit loads of 
weed and you hear about that happening.

3430
02:31:23,041 --> 02:31:23,820
You're probably like,
oh my God,

3431
02:31:23,850 --> 02:31:25,760
we're on a boat when it.
Where are they?

3432
02:31:25,960 --> 02:31:29,860
Where are they traveling?
I don't know if you Google weezer cruise

3433
02:31:30,350 --> 02:31:33,060
back yet.
I think they came back yesterday.

3434
02:31:33,120 --> 02:31:34,350
Yeah.
All right.

3435
02:31:34,351 --> 02:31:36,030
Let's bring this shit back around the 
harbor,

3436
02:31:36,090 --> 02:31:38,190
so to speak.
Poor choice of words.

3437
02:31:38,280 --> 02:31:39,740
No Pun intended.
Quite honestly.

3438
02:31:40,320 --> 02:31:42,120
Just slipped up.
Powerful.

3439
02:31:42,150 --> 02:31:44,200
Joe.
I love you.

3440
02:31:44,201 --> 02:31:47,580
We'll see you in Chicago.
It's going to be fucking off the chain.

3441
02:31:47,581 --> 02:31:49,050
I'm training all week.
I'm ready.

3442
02:31:49,140 --> 02:31:49,620
Oh,
pleasure.

3443
02:31:49,621 --> 02:31:51,870
Hang with you.
My brother has always fucking grave when

3444
02:31:51,871 --> 02:31:56,871
we eat some Italian sausage sandwiches.
You want to go to dinner with us 

3445
02:31:56,871 --> 02:31:56,880

Come on Hollywood tonight.

You have set side.
There were fucking savage already.

3447
02:31:59,580 --> 02:32:00,810
Dirty freaks.
Like I said,

3448
02:32:00,811 --> 02:32:04,440
Chicago almost sold out.
There's a link on my twitter page.

3449
02:32:04,441 --> 02:32:06,420
You can find it somewhere on Joe

Next week after,
after Chicago.

3486
02:33:58,620 --> 02:34:03,620
What do you say about you and and 
Felicia know you and Felicia coming to 

3487
02:34:03,620 --> 02:34:08,361
the podcast?
Come into Pasadena and we'll do it in 

3488
02:34:08,361 --> 02:34:09,330
the passenger before Vegas.
Yes.

3489
02:34:09,331 --> 02:34:10,590
Before,
before Vegas,

3490
02:34:10,591 --> 02:34:15,591
which will be a third.
Tickets are on sale now at House of 

3491
02:34:15,591 --> 02:34:20,330
Blues and Vegas.
Unfortunately there's going to be 

3492
02:34:20,330 --> 02:34:20,330
standing room.

3493
02:34:20,330 --> 02:34:20,560
There's going to be people that have to 
stand in the back of it.

3494
02:34:20,561 --> 02:34:23,500
That's all we could get.
I hate standing shows.

3495
02:34:23,501 --> 02:34:27,280
I avoid them like the plague,
but it was standing show or no show.

3496
02:34:27,480 --> 02:34:30,400
We had to go with the static shows.
The other place,

3497
02:34:30,401 --> 02:34:33,580
the Mandalay Bay theater that we always 
perform at is being renovated.

3498
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:35,950
They're doing some crazy.
Michael Jackson show there,

3499
02:34:35,951 --> 02:34:39,040
so we really want to talk about Carlos 
conduit yet.

3500
02:34:40,360 --> 02:34:43,490
We'll do that next week.
That's next week to fucking blow up.

3501
02:34:44,380 --> 02:34:46,200
That's going to be spectacular.
That I love you.

3502
02:34:46,240 --> 02:34:48,340
We might have to do one with you and 
joey for that one.

3503
02:34:48,370 --> 02:34:53,370
Oh,
you and Eddie rather you would have 

3504
02:34:53,370 --> 02:34:53,370
died.
That's what we'll do next week.

3505
02:34:53,370 --> 02:34:56,311
Next week.
You dirty freaks subscribed to the desk 

3506
02:34:56,311 --> 02:34:57,790
squad on itunes.
It's number six right now and that is on

3507
02:34:57,810 --> 02:35:02,810
the power of the Brian callen show,
which is the most recent podcast added 

3508
02:35:02,810 --> 02:35:04,990
to the desk squad label and of course 
ice house chronicles,

3509
02:35:05,200 --> 02:35:08,620
which is the second most recent and my 
favorite podcast of the week.

3510
02:35:09,220 --> 02:35:14,220
We do that one at the ice house.
We have all the comics come in and sit 

3511
02:35:14,220 --> 02:35:16,420
down.
This past week we had a Bert Kreischer,

3512
02:35:16,421 --> 02:35:19,300
Dane Cook.
A Ra should fear was on.

3513
02:35:19,330 --> 02:35:20,830
It's a fucking.
It's a hang.

3514
02:35:20,980 --> 02:35:24,700
It's a real look into the green room,
completely uncensored.

3515
02:35:24,880 --> 02:35:29,880
It's the real deal.
It's really comics hanging out before 

3516
02:35:29,880 --> 02:35:30,340
the show and then we jump up at the ice 
house,

3517
02:35:30,341 --> 02:35:34,180
which is one of the oldest and most 
respected clubs in the country.

3518
02:35:34,181 --> 02:35:35,950
Happens to be in Pasadena,
California.

3519
02:35:35,951 --> 02:35:38,770
That's where we do our thing.
That's quite.tv,

3520
02:35:38,980 --> 02:35:41,440
[inaudible] dot TV.
We'll see you guys on Wednesday.

3521
02:35:41,650 --> 02:35:43,360
Thanks for tuning in.
Thanks for everything.

3522
02:35:43,361 --> 02:35:46,480
Thanks for all the positive tweets and 
all the love and all the energy.

3523
02:35:46,870 --> 02:35:49,660
We love you from the bottom of my heart.
This is a movement.

3524
02:35:49,661 --> 02:35:54,661
We're all part of this shit together.
This is the reason why this works is 

3525
02:35:54,661 --> 02:35:55,180
because of you guys.
It's all together.

3526
02:35:55,340 --> 02:35:57,350
We respect you.
We appreciate it.

3527
02:35:58,050 --> 02:36:00,490
We tweet and everything that we find.
It's cool.

3528
02:36:00,491 --> 02:36:02,470
We're all connected together in this 
motherfucker.

3529
02:36:02,650 --> 02:36:03,610
Let's keep it together.
Bitches.

3530
02:36:03,611 --> 02:36:04,000
They black.
