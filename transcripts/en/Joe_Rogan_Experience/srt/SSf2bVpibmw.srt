1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:04,170
Thanks for doing this man.
My pleasure.

2
00:00:04,171 --> 00:00:04,770
My right.
Here we go.

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,710
Experience Joe Rogan podcast.
There's only been two people ever.

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,890
The dentist Mckenna's record recommended
for this podcast.

5
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,300
You and josh worker him,
so that puts you in very lofty company.

6
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:33,810
Dahmer.
That's the way Daimler.

7
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,780
Dame French.
It's dumb air.

8
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,500
But is that how your family pronounces 
it the correct way?

9
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:45,540
Damers the best.
But do your friends call you a dumb air 

10
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:46,740
buddy?
Like give you full respect in the French

11
00:00:46,741 --> 00:00:47,550
heritage?
No.

12
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,170
No.
That's a thousand years ago.

13
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:55,040
They gave it up after awhile.
They gave it up after they invaded 

14
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,040
Britain.
Ten 66.

15
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,160
That's clever.
That's a good move.

16
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:59,120
You've got a very unusual background,
man.

17
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:04,130
I mean,
Dennis would not stop raving about you 

18
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:04,130
and then when I started doing research 
on you,

19
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:04,860
I was like,
you were.

20
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,340
This is the craziest story of all time.
Not not the craziest,

21
00:01:08,341 --> 00:01:13,341
but it's pretty crazy.
You were in burning man during Katrina 

22
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,430
with you are partying and Bernie Mann 
with people who work in the Pentagon.

23
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,270
Yes.
When Katrina went down camp ply a gun.

24
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:26,280
That is the most ridiculous thing that 
gives me great discomfort to know.

25
00:01:26,281 --> 00:01:31,140
The people who work in the Pentagon are 
partying at burning man rocking.

26
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,850
We called for Blackhawks,
but we got the order tonight,

27
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:38,130
but that's a whole other.
That's a whole story.

28
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:38,580
Well,
that's.

29
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,650
We'll.
When Katrina was happening,

30
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,440
you guys were amongst the people that 
were in burning man,

31
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:46,440
the very few that had a connection to 
the outside world.

32
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,310
If we had a,
you know,

33
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:53,530
we're.
Our camp was doing the Wifi and the 

34
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,260
Internet for burning man,
for the public and emergency networks,

35
00:01:54,261 --> 00:01:59,261
the private network.
And so we had a dish and we could 

36
00:01:59,261 --> 00:02:02,530
takeover satellites.
So one of our guys took over recon 

37
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:02,530
satellite.

38
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,320
Is it a Pentagon move?

39
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:07,340
Is it depending on.
Woo.

40
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:11,690
So he took this thing offline and I'd 
actually been at a,

41
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:16,770
a is NRO national reconnaissance office.
I had been at an nro launch just the 

42
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:24,300
year before.
And then I look over and I see the logo 

43
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,680
on the laptop and I say,
what are you doing,

44
00:02:26,681 --> 00:02:29,650
you know,
to this man who remain nameless.

45
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,200
He said,
shut up and turned his laptop away.

46
00:02:32,201 --> 00:02:37,201
And he pounded in a code and he took 
this thing off line and so our iridium 

47
00:02:37,201 --> 00:02:37,940
phone rang,
you know,

48
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:41,710
this Pentagon wireless satellite phone 
that's like the,

49
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:46,790
the,
the general on the other side is saying 

50
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:49,500
what's going on and basically the,
he instructed the guy not to answer.

51
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:56,970
So we then had control of this thing and
we could watch Katrina come in because 

52
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:01,690
the government wasn't doing with all 
this national resource assets to,

53
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:07,310
to help people.
And this was the frustration that he 

54
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:07,310
had.

55
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:11,220
He wanted to be evacuated to be taken 
out off Playa with Black Hawks and heavy

56
00:03:11,801 --> 00:03:15,010
duty helicopters because he had just 
come back from the Asian tsunami,

57
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,350
you know,
the event.

58
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:22,800
And then he went straight to,
to Afghanistan and then he went to 

59
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:22,800
Baghdad.
And then he came to burning man.

60
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,690
I looked at this man's face.
It was like lying deeply,

61
00:03:25,691 --> 00:03:28,000
you know,
just unbelievable stress.

62
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:31,930
Can you imagine this was his job.
He works under title 10 money,

63
00:03:31,931 --> 00:03:35,620
doing extreme comms,
extreme emergency relief efforts.

64
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:41,430
And he's invented all this shit,
like cell phones that come down on 

65
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,840
parachutes that'll run for a month.
And people pick up these cell phones and

66
00:03:43,841 --> 00:03:48,841
push a button and there's somebody who 
speaks tagalog the right on right there 

67
00:03:48,841 --> 00:03:50,020
to say,
what do you need?

68
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:52,480
What are your.
What's your position in that?

69
00:03:52,481 --> 00:03:53,800
Cool.
That's amazing.

70
00:03:53,801 --> 00:03:55,870
That's amazing.
Cell phones run for a month.

71
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:00,900
They're like in rubberized cases,
this guy has invented all this 

72
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:00,900
technology.
So this rubber Rebecca

73
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,090
case just has a massive battery in it.
Sentence

74
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,280
recharged.
Yup.

75
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,300
Yup.
So this guy is really thinking.

76
00:04:06,301 --> 00:04:11,301
So here,
here we have a natural disaster 

77
00:04:11,301 --> 00:04:11,301
happening in our own country.
You know,

78
00:04:11,301 --> 00:04:15,410
barreling in.
Nobody at burning man knows about it 

79
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:17,640
because there's no cell phone service 
fan back in 2007.

80
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:23,150
It's barreling in and 2005 rather.
And we watch it coming in.

81
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,680
Now the,
the amazing thing is we,

82
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:30,700
we saw you could watch a video for more,
but on this screen,

83
00:04:31,051 --> 00:04:36,051
on this guy screen,
and you could watch people walking down 

84
00:04:36,051 --> 00:04:39,780
like we saw levy breach the first levy 
breach in the ninth ward or something.

85
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:43,230
We saw that on the screen from,
from our camp at burning man.

86
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:45,330
So when you say you took over 
satellites,

87
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,050
satellites that are broadcasting,
what is it?

88
00:04:47,051 --> 00:04:51,010
Broadcasting media like news,
Fresno,

89
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,260
high risk reconnaissance imagery.
Okay.

90
00:04:53,261 --> 00:04:57,340
So it's a satellite that is like one of 
those spying on bad guy satellites.

91
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:59,030
Exactly.
Whoa.

92
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,120
Yeah.
Couldn't eat.

93
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,710
We couldn't read.
I can talk about this.

94
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:06,400
Go ahead.
If someone finds out about that,

95
00:05:06,401 --> 00:05:07,570
is that like,
is this an issue?

96
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:13,110
I don't think so.
I mean it's something that would be 

97
00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:15,840
really frowned upon.
Well the,

98
00:05:15,841 --> 00:05:18,880
the phone,
the iridium phone kept ringing.

99
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:24,480
Yeah.
It's like your dad's call and you're 

100
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,000
having a party.
The neighbors are calling your dad 

101
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,000
going,
hey man,

102
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I don't know what your son's doing,
but uh,

103
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,750
the lights are on,
there's a million people on your front 

104
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:30,750
lawn and the phone just keeps ringing 
and you're like,

105
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:30,750
ah,

106
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,850
but these guys knew who they're dealing 
with.

107
00:05:32,851 --> 00:05:37,851
This is this innovative genius type guy 
that is totally respected and 

108
00:05:37,851 --> 00:05:42,650
organization.
So the general that initiated the 

109
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:43,370
inquiry was covering for him.
Oh,

110
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,440
I see.
So the general could then contact space 

111
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:48,440
command and say,
I can't get any of.

112
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,050
Oh,
okay.

113
00:05:49,051 --> 00:05:50,090
Okay.
I see.

114
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:52,680
I see.
He had put the satellite in some kind of

115
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:58,090
a failsafe fallback mode,
so they would spend the several days 

116
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:59,670
trying to get back into it.
Whoa.

117
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:05,190
He was just like,
we kept passing it and keeping them out 

118
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:05,690
and burn hydrazine and locate,
you know,

119
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,220
stuff on,
on the Playa.

120
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:11,270
Wow.
So tell me all the details,

121
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:13,610
but he's basically,
don't you know,

122
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,890
I'm doing this right.
What,

123
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:20,000
what kind of satellite Internet 
connection was available in 2005.

124
00:06:20,001 --> 00:06:22,330
It was a very small,
slow upward,

125
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:24,980
a little bit quicker download,
but still pretty whack.

126
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:30,010
Right.
By that time you have the next year I 

127
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:30,590
think they got the big tower on the 
plier which had the dish.

128
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:32,900
They went right to gurlack with 
[inaudible] three connection.

129
00:06:32,901 --> 00:06:34,640
But what does,
what does that mean?

130
00:06:34,641 --> 00:06:36,530
What'd you just sick of?
Really fast.

131
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:38,580
A sort of,
almost like a radar less.

132
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,250
What is girl girl?
Oh,

133
00:06:40,251 --> 00:06:42,060
you haven't been out there?
Ah No.

134
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,140
You know,
I love hippies in small doses.

135
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:46,550
Hippies to me,
like pizza.

136
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:51,940
We just can't.
I can't eat pizza every day for like a 

137
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:55,210
month I was with.
But you can hang around ply a gun 

138
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:56,900
Pentagon people and yes,
I could probably hang around your camp.

139
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,830
Went out there with and they're dirty 
people with Sherpas,

140
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:02,270
Sherpas,
Sherpas,

141
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,760
Sherpas,
you know,

142
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,600
they're,
they're white people,

143
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:08,510
White Sherpas,
servers for the billionaires and they're

144
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,520
billionaire camps,
but that's too much.

145
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:13,720
And they have walls of motor homes or I 
want to hang out with 100,000

146
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,080
air camp.
I don't want to hang out with ability of

147
00:07:16,081 --> 00:07:21,081
Eric.
You want to hang out with people who 

148
00:07:21,081 --> 00:07:21,590
live in rvs and like,
everybody's clean.

149
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:24,240
But I don't need Sherpas will come.
You know what I.

150
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,990
here's a secret that I'll tell you on 
here.

151
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,270
Oh well it won't be a secret.
A secret.

152
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,200
My of my mit.
So Dennis hasn't been to burning man.

153
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:33,830
Dads,
mechanic,

154
00:07:33,831 --> 00:07:34,580
good.
Me and him.

155
00:07:34,581 --> 00:07:36,950
Same page.
So I've two old guys don't want to party

156
00:07:36,951 --> 00:07:39,650
with young kids.
So I told him that.

157
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:42,170
Dan,
to tell you that Dennis would only go to

158
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:43,940
burning man if you went.
Oh,

159
00:07:43,941 --> 00:07:46,580
did you do it the opposite way?
That's against each other.

160
00:07:46,581 --> 00:07:47,320
There you go.
Yeah.

161
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,830
That doesn't work with me,
but thanks.

162
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:53,150
That's sweet.
So I would go anywhere with him though,

163
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:58,480
anywhere with Dennis.
I really would go with him just to talk 

164
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:58,480
to them for days.
Yeah.

165
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:58,480
Yeah.
He's,

166
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,680
he's amazing.
The world's most amazing teddy bear.

167
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:01,790
Yeah.
He's uh,

168
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:06,880
he's.
He explained the stoned ape theory in a 

169
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,961
way that I've never heard anybody 
explain before with science and the way 

170
00:08:10,961 --> 00:08:13,910
that psilocybin interacts with the human
mind in a way was like,

171
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:15,140
oh yeah,
oh,

172
00:08:15,141 --> 00:08:17,000
that had to be a part of it.
You know,

173
00:08:17,001 --> 00:08:20,630
I'm sure there's many factors that led 
to the increase in human brain size,

174
00:08:20,631 --> 00:08:22,260
but when he describes it,
he was like,

175
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:24,310
oh,
that's fucking mushrooms has to be.

176
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,540
And you know,
we were at a meeting,

177
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:32,200
an event yesterday where all the 
silicide when research was being 

178
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,171
presented by the Johns Hopkins teams and
Ucla and Madison thinks these people are

179
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:42,130
doing silicide funded research to for 
smoking cessation,

180
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:47,950
end of life,
reduction of anxiety and ptsd.

181
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:51,140
And this one young researcher,
Matt,

182
00:08:51,141 --> 00:08:56,141
that we talked to,
he basically said this amazing thing 

183
00:08:56,141 --> 00:08:56,340
which was,
we're not

184
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:01,730
plugging up neurotransmitter portals to 
deal with addiction here.

185
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:07,550
We seem to be hitting higher order brain
functions much higher rather than 

186
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:12,860
plugging up your desire for nicotine.
We're when we watched the FMRS,

187
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:17,930
when we put people under the magnet,
which means put them in an Fmri try 

188
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:19,800
realtime brain scanning.
We watched this,

189
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:25,050
the parts of the brain talking to each 
other like the default mode network 

190
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:25,410
seems to be changed

191
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,630
and is this while you're under while 
they're on mushrooms.

192
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:34,010
See,
I would have to think that suicide 

193
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:36,570
suicide,
that was the thing that would radically 

194
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:38,570
affect your experience because it an Mri
and Fmri.

195
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,360
Similar because I've been an MRI before.
It was like bang,

196
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:41,940
Bang,
Bang,

197
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,060
Bang,
Bang.

198
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,480
If I was on mushrooms and I was in an 
Mri,

199
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:48,810
I would freak the fuck out.
Yeah.

200
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:54,040
I've never been in a functional Mri.
I've never been in Mr and Oh,

201
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:58,230
I was in one less than a year ago.
I had a,

202
00:09:58,231 --> 00:10:02,470
an issue with my back and I had a 
bulging disc in my back,

203
00:10:02,471 --> 00:10:06,850
so I had to get an examined by an MRI 
and you lie down on a plank,

204
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:12,180
like a little skinny little gurney thing
and they roll you into this tube machine

205
00:10:12,641 --> 00:10:17,641
that's a giant magnet and all I could 
think of some story that I had heard 

206
00:10:17,641 --> 00:10:21,271
about some kid who died because they 
left a fire extinguisher in the room and

207
00:10:21,711 --> 00:10:26,711
then turned on the Mri and it sucked the
fire extinguisher into the bag and 

208
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:31,300
killed one freak incident out of a 
billion usage.

209
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:34,750
It was like a torpedo that killed 
somebody.

210
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:39,770
Um,
but it's a very claustrophobic and 

211
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:42,391
strange experience.
You roll into this thing and just lay 

212
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:43,170
there,
you can't move and you can't bang,

213
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:43,950
Bang,
Bang,

214
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:44,700
Bang,
Bang,

215
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,100
Bang,
Bang,

216
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:50,110
Bang,
kick around your head.

217
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:52,150
It's all just echoing around you.
I mean,

218
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:57,151
you get earplugs put ear plugs on and 
you close your eyes and just deal with 

219
00:10:57,151 --> 00:11:00,271
it.
But I would imagine that tripping on 

220
00:11:00,271 --> 00:11:02,491
that would be incredibly strange.
So I would think if for MRI is very 

221
00:11:02,591 --> 00:11:07,120
similar to its functional Mri,
if it's the same machine,

222
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,080
that would mean the old adage is,
you know,

223
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:12,310
five grams and silent darkness.
Right.

224
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,320
That's what terence always described her
as kind of prescribed or buddy this is 

225
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,420
like the opposite of five grams and 
silent dark desks

226
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:25,070
like a.
well maybe they've got it down to a 

227
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:25,070
baseball cap now.
You know,

228
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:26,250
I don't think they do.
I don't think they do.

229
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:29,040
I've had two Mris actually in the past 
year and a half,

230
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:30,000
so I'm pretty sure

231
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:35,060
maybe by the 2015 will all be like this 
is a theory that I have of where it all 

232
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,420
this is going.
Then I can

233
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:38,710
revealed to you later.
Oh,

234
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,820
excellent.
I'm absolutely interested.

235
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,120
But what all I was thinking was that the
whole experience of siliciden depends 

236
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,740
very much so on where you're at while 
you're experiencing it.

237
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,860
If you're in a beautiful,
peaceful place,

238
00:11:53,861 --> 00:11:54,150
like

239
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:59,450
the colors are brighter and you see like
all sorts of cool visions and you have 

240
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:02,280
this connection to nature where you feel
like you're grounded and.

241
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:07,620
But if you were in like some horrible 
place and you were on suicide and you 

242
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,350
would be very sensitive to that horrible
place,

243
00:12:08,351 --> 00:12:13,351
I couldn't imagine like doing psilocybin
and going to like a war zone and 

244
00:12:13,351 --> 00:12:14,260
experiencing war,
you know,

245
00:12:14,261 --> 00:12:17,110
or,
or anything else horrible like the gym.

246
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:21,880
What was the movie that depicted the 
Vietnam fats?

247
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,870
You know,
what?

248
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:26,370
Was that a Jacob's ladder?
No,

249
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:29,670
the ones where they got high in Vietnam 
on all said.

250
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:30,960
Oh,
what movie?

251
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,730
One movie A.
Not Apocalypse now.

252
00:12:33,731 --> 00:12:35,860
Apocalypse now weren't an acid.
Oh,

253
00:12:35,861 --> 00:12:37,950
that's right.
Martin Sheen was on acid when he punched

254
00:12:37,951 --> 00:12:40,930
him when he did karate and his hotel 
room and punch the mayor.

255
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:46,270
I know there's another,
there's a video of British soldiers on 

256
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:46,270
acid and the fifties.

257
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:50,670
You remember that.
And they're all thing and they can't be 

258
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:53,401
made to fear the enemy or put fear into 
the enemy or be a part of any 

259
00:12:53,401 --> 00:12:57,700
organization,
which is what the British army was about

260
00:12:57,701 --> 00:12:58,500
to become.
Anyway.

261
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,730
Yeah.
That's a beautiful video.

262
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:05,790
I love that video.
That was peace and love before the 

263
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:06,970
Beatles even got rolling and 59,
right?

264
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:07,840
Yeah.
Well,

265
00:13:07,841 --> 00:13:12,841
it shows you also what a incredible like
transformative drug that isn't really 

266
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:17,650
for the most part,
all psychedelics have that capacity,

267
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,050
so incredibly transformative capacity 
because you're here,

268
00:13:20,051 --> 00:13:23,800
you're dealing with people whose job is 
to kill folks.

269
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:26,620
That's what their job is and what are 
they doing?

270
00:13:26,621 --> 00:13:31,540
They're giggling and they're falling 
down and they're not thinking about war.

271
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:32,980
They're,
they're like,

272
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:35,880
they think everything's preposterous.
You know?

273
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:40,960
And it's just amazing when you look at 
the transformation in our culture from 

274
00:13:41,651 --> 00:13:45,460
the 1950 [inaudible] to 1970 when 
everything was clamped down on.

275
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:50,850
I mean,
what a radical couple of decades of 

276
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:50,850
change.
I mean,

277
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:54,691
people don't realize.
I mean I trying to explain to people 

278
00:13:54,691 --> 00:13:56,200
that if you like,
I'm a technology historian,

279
00:13:56,201 --> 00:13:58,060
you know,
I have the Dog Barn Computer Museum,

280
00:13:58,061 --> 00:14:03,061
I've got like 30 tons of vintage 
computer hardware in the barn and I've 

281
00:14:03,061 --> 00:14:05,440
interviewed a thousand people on how did
this all happen?

282
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:10,470
How did the Arpanet get made?
How to apple found and all that sort of 

283
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:13,741
stuff.
And that the years between 1945 and 

284
00:14:13,741 --> 00:14:14,260
1970,
oh my God.

285
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,210
The,
the change that happened.

286
00:14:16,211 --> 00:14:17,350
Unbelievable.
Unbelievable.

287
00:14:17,351 --> 00:14:21,910
And really if you drive into a 
neighborhood like even around here,

288
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,720
San Fernando valley houses built in like
1962.

289
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:30,040
The only difference in technology is 
that there's ether net,

290
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,470
like there's an internet,
there's a network and there's computers.

291
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:37,750
Otherwise House of 1970,
he had microwave ovens and a cable TV in

292
00:14:38,141 --> 00:14:39,470
the beginning and all that sort of 
stuff.

293
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:42,490
Not a lot of difference.
Just the digital tech.

294
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:46,810
That's the only really big thing that's 
come in and that model has now spread to

295
00:14:46,811 --> 00:14:50,230
the whole planet.
So China did it in shorter time,

296
00:14:50,231 --> 00:14:55,231
you know,
and I lived in Czechoslovakia and they 

297
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:55,231
did the whole transition in like eight 
years.

298
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,990
This incredible South Africans at the 
transition,

299
00:14:56,991 --> 00:15:01,580
like 15,
just boom to our model shopping center,

300
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,050
you know,
off ramp,

301
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:07,250
you know,
wired into the Matrix,

302
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,690
you know,
consumer culture,

303
00:15:08,691 --> 00:15:10,040
Boone,
the whole world just went bang,

304
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:10,400
Bang,
Bang,

305
00:15:10,401 --> 00:15:10,850
Bang,
Bang,

306
00:15:10,851 --> 00:15:13,370
adopting that.
It's a very strange time,

307
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:14,600
isn't it?
Yeah.

308
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,850
Yeah.
And everyone's rushing to that model.

309
00:15:16,851 --> 00:15:17,630
I mean,
there's no,

310
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,430
no stopping it.
Well,

311
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,710
it's,
everything's tied into it now too,

312
00:15:21,711 --> 00:15:23,390
which is really spooky.
You know,

313
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:28,340
I'm absolutely fascinated by ancient 
cultures,

314
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:33,580
by the idea that there were great 
civilizations that fell apart and like 

315
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,810
what caused it wasn't natural disaster 
was at this,

316
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:36,380
was that.

317
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:41,480
And when you look at grain ham,
Graham Hancock on last month,

318
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:43,580
I've had grandma a few times.
He's awesome.

319
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:48,640
And I've also had Randall Carlson on 
who's also really enlightening when it 

320
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,290
comes to that subject because he's a 
true expert in cataclysmic disasters.

321
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:56,470
Particularly the comment,
the putative comment impairment that 

322
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:56,920
created all that flooding.
Yeah,

323
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,570
one of his.
I mean he's,

324
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,600
he's an expert on pretty much every 
significant traceable impact and it's 

325
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:10,220
really crazy.
He can drive his suv and read land.

326
00:16:10,221 --> 00:16:15,221
Right.
You can sort of read the teaching him 

327
00:16:15,221 --> 00:16:15,221
about what happened.
Well,

328
00:16:15,221 --> 00:16:18,140
he'll show you some things on satellite 
images that if you looked at it,

329
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,550
you would go,
oh,

330
00:16:19,551 --> 00:16:22,910
that's just some hills and heal.
But the way he described it,

331
00:16:22,911 --> 00:16:24,050
he'll draw it out for,
you know,

332
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:29,230
here's where the crater is and this is 
where the craters in the middle of this 

333
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:29,870
ocean and this,
this part of the ocean.

334
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:34,870
And if you follow that crater out,
you realize these are where the waves 

335
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:38,351
hit toward the landscape apart like 
you're looking at a gigantic version of 

336
00:16:38,451 --> 00:16:43,451
what you see when you see the ocean 
leave marks on the sand when high tide 

337
00:16:43,521 --> 00:16:48,521
comes in,
but you're seeing this unbelievably 

338
00:16:48,521 --> 00:16:49,820
extreme version of it that probably 
happened instantaneously.

339
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,000
You remember Jerry personnel and Larry 
Nibins Scifi classic Lucifer's Hammer.

340
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:56,990
No,
it's fantastic.

341
00:16:56,991 --> 00:17:01,400
It was about a comment impact on the 
Pacific and the scene.

342
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:06,780
These are master Saifai writers.
They both live in here in the San 

343
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:10,330
Fernando Valley.
And this wave was a 1200 feet tall and 

344
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:15,011
he did.
They describe it coming across the 

345
00:17:15,011 --> 00:17:15,110
southland.
And there's this surfer now,

346
00:17:15,111 --> 00:17:17,720
the surfers out on Santa Monica,
right?

347
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:23,410
Decides to take this wave.
Now what's happening before the wave 

348
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:26,240
arrives,
as the ocean is roaring at hundred miles

349
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,850
an hour out toward the sea.
So this guy has been carried out,

350
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,300
you know,
40 miles out to sea because it's wave is

351
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:37,190
sucking down the coastline,
but he knows what is going on because he

352
00:17:37,191 --> 00:17:40,370
saw the fireball because I'm going to 
die anyway.

353
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:45,610
I'm going to try to take this wave and 
this is a great scifi novel and he does 

354
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:50,441
it.
And what happens is the wave comes 

355
00:17:50,441 --> 00:17:50,441
across,
he looks down

356
00:17:50,441 --> 00:17:55,400
and he can,
he's on the face of this wave is coming 

357
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,880
across Los Angeles and,
and he's looking down at the city,

358
00:17:56,881 --> 00:18:01,881
you know,
like 800 feet below as this wave is 

359
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:05,270
because he has on the face of it and 
he's managing his board and then he 

360
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,160
just,
and he looks up and the,

361
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,320
the,
the language is great.

362
00:18:07,321 --> 00:18:09,480
It's like in the first interstate 
building,

363
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,920
hit like a flyswatter,
you know,

364
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:17,010
that's a crazy way to die in the wave 
crashed.

365
00:18:17,011 --> 00:18:20,580
It went inland to like a palm springs 
kind of indio.

366
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:25,820
That's where.
And it created sort of Lucifer's hammer 

367
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,360
worth getting worth getting.
And here's the reading.

368
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:32,880
Uh,
Larry Niven and Jerry poor now are the 

369
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,750
two great hardcore Saifai writers.
And Larry told me about 15 years ago,

370
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:40,230
he said,
let me tell you something,

371
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:46,070
uh,
I was in my office when there was this 

372
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:49,401
earthquake,
like you've been in the south line long 

373
00:18:49,401 --> 00:18:49,401
enough,
right?

374
00:18:49,401 --> 00:18:52,210
There's this earthquakes every x amount 
of time and they do a certain amount of 

375
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:52,210
damage,
like northridge was big,

376
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:55,710
but before northridge,
Larry sit in his office at like eight in

377
00:18:55,711 --> 00:19:00,711
the morning and an earthquake hits,
I think it's the whittier quake or 

378
00:19:00,711 --> 00:19:03,771
something.
And the last thing he remembers this a 

379
00:19:03,771 --> 00:19:03,870
bookshelf coming right at him.
Right.

380
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:07,560
And he comes to and he is blacked out.
I mean,

381
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:09,190
he's blacked out for a couple of hours.
Right.

382
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:14,160
And he has this vision comes to,
he sees a spine of books and one of them

383
00:19:14,161 --> 00:19:19,161
says Lucifer's hammer hardcover edition.
And he realizes I was almost killed by 

384
00:19:20,671 --> 00:19:23,970
my life's work.
Yes.

385
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,910
And Lucifer.
Samara knocked him out.

386
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:31,230
Wow.
So he bolted the shelf to the wall for 

387
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:31,230
the next one.

388
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:31,540
That's a good move.
Bolting shelves.

389
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:35,800
Always good move here.
We started this off talking about,

390
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,840
um,
being fascinated with ancient 

391
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:41,040
civilizations and the fact that we don't
really like,

392
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:44,490
we know quite a bit about ancient Egypt 
in,

393
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,160
in sort of,
if you look at it,

394
00:19:48,161 --> 00:19:52,330
the fact that it's 2,500
plus BC and we know quite a bit.

395
00:19:52,331 --> 00:19:57,331
That's a long time ago and we have some 
pretty incredible structures are still 

396
00:19:57,331 --> 00:19:58,150
remained from them,
which is pretty amazing.

397
00:19:58,151 --> 00:20:03,151
But no writing.
I mean just hieroglyphs we don't have 

398
00:20:03,151 --> 00:20:06,061
books for the library of Alexandria was 
burned to the ground and who knows what 

399
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:07,210
was in that,
you know,

400
00:20:07,211 --> 00:20:12,211
there's so much lost when it comes to 
ancient civilizations and one of the 

401
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:16,141
things that I worry about is that we're 
moving everything digital and 

402
00:20:16,141 --> 00:20:17,170
everything,
even more than just digital.

403
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:22,350
People are storing things in the cloud 
like crazy and that when we get a 

404
00:20:23,351 --> 00:20:25,120
Lucifer's hammer,
it's all gone.

405
00:20:25,121 --> 00:20:30,121
Right.
That's the thing is if we left behind 

406
00:20:30,121 --> 00:20:32,770
some flash drives and some hard drives 
in some old computers and stuff and then

407
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:38,550
everybody else died except for like a 
few thousand people that live like 

408
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:39,400
nomads,
how long would that stuff even make it?

409
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:41,590
How long would it take?
We'd all be absorbed by the earth.

410
00:20:41,591 --> 00:20:41,830
Right.

411
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:46,900
You remember wally trying to get all the
trash compacted and everything and he's 

412
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,040
choosing things that he would know the 
volley

413
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,310
of the robot from the movie,
the Pixar movie and he's like,

414
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,630
oh,
keep that.

415
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,130
You know,
because he's,

416
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:58,140
he's making a library apart,
so he hit himself going skins of going 

417
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:02,281
for 50,000
years this way and the shit he's 

418
00:21:02,281 --> 00:21:05,431
throwing away,
like he does keep an ipod because it 

419
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:05,680
plays his favorite movie,
you know,

420
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,780
and he's able to rig it up.
He's a robot,

421
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,730
right?
He's a little macintosh robot,

422
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:10,920
right.
But uh,

423
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:15,980
it's interesting to see the pixars 
depiction of what is going to trash and 

424
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:19,020
when the earth is so toxic and is 
covered with trash and the people have a

425
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:22,690
VAT evacuating our living aboard a ship 
because the earth detoxified.

426
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:28,620
But we're sort of banking on the fact 
that nothing happens when we have like 

427
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,230
the Georgia guidestones which are 
dubious.

428
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:33,130
It's very weird.
So key population to $500,000,

429
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:38,200
$500,
million worldwide or something like 

430
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:38,200
that,
you know,

431
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,250
it's like very interesting rules to live
by,

432
00:21:39,251 --> 00:21:42,460
but it doesn't tell you anything about 
how to set up solar power,

433
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:44,350
you know,
what is the Internet,

434
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,380
how is it,
how does it connect China to the UK,

435
00:21:47,381 --> 00:21:48,430
you know,
there's none of that.

436
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,860
So here's an interesting thing for you.
Britton,

437
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:56,100
southern Britain,
when Rome fell right and the Romans 

438
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,720
left,
no one was there to maintain lead pipes.

439
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:03,990
So the Romans invented fantastic bath 
systems with lead pipes that that could 

440
00:22:05,021 --> 00:22:06,250
run cold water,
hot wire,

441
00:22:06,251 --> 00:22:11,251
that valves and everything.
It's all this stuff went to potty and 

442
00:22:11,251 --> 00:22:15,121
the roads went bluey and the Roman roads
were straight and they had these 

443
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:19,390
mountains on either side that you could 
have watchers and stuff like that.

444
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:21,670
And it was super high tech,
right?

445
00:22:21,671 --> 00:22:24,670
And then Roman went away and all this 
stuff just fell into ruin.

446
00:22:24,671 --> 00:22:26,560
And the British forgot how to make 
bricks.

447
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:28,620
So there are no brick buildings,
you know,

448
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:33,660
they had to go back to knocking out 
stone to build the first Christian 

449
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:37,411
churches in England were made out of 
because they did not have brick 

450
00:22:37,411 --> 00:22:39,740
technology gone.
What was the classic example of like,

451
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:43,450
what's going on right now is we have so 
many things that we need.

452
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:46,970
Like I had a joke that I was doing about
how uh,

453
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:52,170
what I thought happened with Egypt was 
that the dumb people just out fuck the 

454
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:56,641
smart people and left behind a bunch of 
shit that didn't understand and that if 

455
00:22:56,641 --> 00:22:59,170
I left you alone in the woods right now 
with a hatchet,

456
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,270
how long before you could send me an 
email,

457
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:01,930
right?
Like,

458
00:23:01,931 --> 00:23:04,990
we have so much that we rely on on a 
daily basis.

459
00:23:04,991 --> 00:23:06,100
Me,
you might not understand it,

460
00:23:06,101 --> 00:23:09,640
but I don't understand it.
Most people that use it don't understand

461
00:23:09,641 --> 00:23:11,920
it.
One of the most terrifying TV shows I've

462
00:23:11,921 --> 00:23:14,680
ever seen about this as James Burke's 
connections,

463
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:18,700
which came around 1980.
And in the first episode,

464
00:23:18,701 --> 00:23:20,610
what you see is this British guy,
you know,

465
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:22,540
he's a master presenter,
right?

466
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:28,170
And he's walking up to a screen door on 
a farm and he's saying the electricity 

467
00:23:28,631 --> 00:23:30,640
has been off for a week,
two weeks,

468
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:31,660
four weeks.

469
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:35,050
The people are starving.
People are trying to leave the city.

470
00:23:35,051 --> 00:23:38,560
You escape the city.
You managed to get to this farm.

471
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:41,260
The farm is abandoned,
right?

472
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:46,980
You know,
it's one of the places you could 

473
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:46,980
survive.
You are coming up to the door.

474
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:49,220
The people are not there.
What do you do?

475
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:51,530
You Go,
you see this a milking machine,

476
00:23:51,531 --> 00:23:53,570
you can't use it.
It's no electricity.

477
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:59,200
You see everything that you can't use to
farm even though you maybe you 

478
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:01,850
understand farming,
but modern farming.

479
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:07,180
Then you go up into the attic of the 
barn and you find a discarded plow from 

480
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:10,220
like the 19 tense.
That is your tool.

481
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:13,910
You have to know how to use that and how
to put that onto animals,

482
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:16,850
onto pulling draft animals to break the 
soil.

483
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:20,660
You're now in the 11th century.
If you can't master that plow,

484
00:24:20,661 --> 00:24:25,661
if you can find that plow and know 
everything there is to do about that 

485
00:24:25,661 --> 00:24:26,420
technology,
you're Outta luck.

486
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:31,810
Everything else is just trashed at that 
point and that would go away in a 

487
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:35,060
thousand years if that was still left 
around 10,000

488
00:24:35,061 --> 00:24:36,050
years from now,
there'll be nothing.

489
00:24:36,051 --> 00:24:41,051
No plows and knowing.
So how much do you think happened like 

490
00:24:41,051 --> 00:24:42,140
that with like ancient Egypt?
I mean,

491
00:24:42,141 --> 00:24:47,141
how much of that stuff,
just whatever they built or whatever 

492
00:24:47,141 --> 00:24:47,480
they designed,
I mean we were essentially,

493
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,720
we have fossil remanence of their 
civilization.

494
00:24:50,721 --> 00:24:54,860
We have what,
what survived and pottery form and stone

495
00:24:54,861 --> 00:24:59,861
form the papers all gone either burned 
or destroyed or thrown in rivers or 

496
00:25:00,441 --> 00:25:02,540
whatever.
There's very little.

497
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:04,100
That's,
I mean,

498
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:09,230
how much of what we have today would be 
around in just like a thousand years.

499
00:25:09,231 --> 00:25:11,380
All the computers would be gone.
Cars would be gone.

500
00:25:11,381 --> 00:25:13,430
You know,
there's that great tv.

501
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:18,300
Was it on discovery or history or they 
showed the earth after people are center

502
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,690
people and man,
you knew watch Manhattan,

503
00:25:20,691 --> 00:25:23,600
you watch the at 500 years.

504
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:28,810
Uh,
the Brooklyn Bridge finally comes down 

505
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:28,810
because it's so well built.
You know,

506
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:31,640
the,
the case ons are all incredibly strongly

507
00:25:31,641 --> 00:25:36,641
that the cable ties and everything.
They figured it would take about 500 

508
00:25:36,641 --> 00:25:38,120
years for those cables to rush through 
in the finally the decking,

509
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:41,720
whatever's left of it to come down.
Nothing has nothing.

510
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,400
But that would be the last piece in New 
York as this.

511
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:47,990
Their skeletal framework,
the blackberry bushes would come back,

512
00:25:47,991 --> 00:25:51,200
the streams would come back in their 
normal of Manhattan island,

513
00:25:51,201 --> 00:25:52,460
right?
It would just come back.

514
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:56,310
Deer would come back in and when the 
last things would be this,

515
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:59,780
this Brooklyn Bridge coming down.
That is so crazy,

516
00:25:59,781 --> 00:26:03,650
but that totally makes sense.
I mean nothing.

517
00:26:03,651 --> 00:26:05,570
None of that stuff lasts.
It's not going to lie.

518
00:26:05,571 --> 00:26:07,490
We don't build mean the pyramids.
Did you know that?

519
00:26:07,491 --> 00:26:12,491
The pyramids.
I didn't know this when we had this 

520
00:26:12,491 --> 00:26:15,850
wonderful lecture by an Egyptologist 
who've worked on the Giza plateau for 

521
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:19,871
like 20 years and he said,
we've discovered so many things about 

522
00:26:19,871 --> 00:26:24,641
the city of artisans and craftsmen teams
that built the pyramids by excavating 

523
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:28,610
this massive area now that they've done.
He said,

524
00:26:28,611 --> 00:26:32,240
one of the things we discovered as the 
pyramids were classed clad with polished

525
00:26:32,241 --> 00:26:36,220
limestone and they used it all to make 
Cairo that chipped it all away.

526
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:41,560
It and you find this in vases in China 
that this stuff was taken off the 

527
00:26:42,621 --> 00:26:43,430
cladding.
Is it?

528
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:44,060
The pyramids

529
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:46,530
used to be shine.
These to be like a prism,

530
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:50,010
say blind you if you're coming at a 
certain angle in the desert,

531
00:26:50,011 --> 00:26:55,011
in the sun.
They were just this incredible shining 

532
00:26:55,011 --> 00:26:55,800
pyramid.
Can you imagine the power on the average

533
00:26:55,801 --> 00:26:58,680
nomads?
Seeing that with a gold cap too.

534
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:02,850
There was a golden cap.
So like our money,

535
00:27:02,851 --> 00:27:05,340
you know,
with the little icon on the top.

536
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,270
Yeah,
but.

537
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:10,020
And so people will rip the stuff off and
they took it and it's all over the world

538
00:27:10,021 --> 00:27:13,080
and various holes.
Assholes ruin everything.

539
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,550
But this,
this guy,

540
00:27:14,551 --> 00:27:19,551
he showed us this initially,
he went to the Giza plateau in the 

541
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:25,760
seventies.
He was part of some kind of a cult that 

542
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,881
believes the parents were built by 
extraterrestrials and he was literally 

543
00:27:28,881 --> 00:27:32,481
in this cult and he went to see it.
He was sort of like sent there by the 

544
00:27:32,611 --> 00:27:37,611
cult,
got so interested in excavation and the 

545
00:27:37,611 --> 00:27:38,220
reality of trying to really solve it.

546
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,630
He sort of left the cult,
went back,

547
00:27:39,631 --> 00:27:44,130
got a phd and he's been working there 
for 20 years and he gave us.

548
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,090
Oh yeah.
It was amazing.

549
00:27:45,091 --> 00:27:47,220
Wow.
And he showed us,

550
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:52,510
like he said,
all the Hollywood mythology of slaves 

551
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:52,650
building the pyramids and was all 
complete.

552
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,660
You know who we are.
Here's,

553
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:59,690
here's the plan of the city of the 
artisans and the construction teams and 

554
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:02,130
the contractors that built a pyramid,
central avenue,

555
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:06,000
big hospital complex,
the best one in the ancient world,

556
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:11,270
huge bakery.
This bakery would make conical bread 

557
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:12,990
loaves that the guys could put a rope 
around,

558
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:17,310
throw over their backs and then go up to
the job site and they ate the bread.

559
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:23,030
And then he said,
we kept cutting down through sand 

560
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:25,290
through these clay layers that didn't 
see that they shouldn't be there.

561
00:28:25,291 --> 00:28:26,000
There's,
you know,

562
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:29,850
20 feet down and there's a layer of 
clay.

563
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:34,020
They figured out the clay was from a 
quarry up up the Amazon App,

564
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:38,100
denial rather no wrong,
bring going in the wrong place.

565
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:39,330
And then he said,
well,

566
00:28:39,331 --> 00:28:44,331
what on earth is going on?
And so they started excavating 

567
00:28:44,331 --> 00:28:45,480
horizontally and they found that these 
were clay tracks.

568
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:46,980
And they said,
well,

569
00:28:46,981 --> 00:28:49,350
what on earth is this?
And then they started seeing these.

570
00:28:49,351 --> 00:28:54,351
These clay tracks matter a lot there,
not just leftover layers in the desert 

571
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:59,540
and then they map them out and there was
a whole network of them and what they 

572
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:03,561
were were low friction slipways and so 
they said they put the blocks on some 

573
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:09,510
kind of a canvas on some kind of a 
thing.

574
00:29:09,511 --> 00:29:14,511
They had mastered low friction.
They'd figured out that clay and an a 

575
00:29:14,511 --> 00:29:19,011
layer,
like a micro layer of water on it 

576
00:29:19,011 --> 00:29:21,510
creates a hydraulic system that you can 
move massive tonnage on.

577
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:27,020
And so they built one of them using the 
same clay from the same quarry up the 

578
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:31,100
Nile they made when they brought all 
these Cairo University engineering 

579
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:34,761
students out or probably mechanical 
engineering and they put like a 

580
00:29:34,761 --> 00:29:38,181
multivitamin block on canvas on this 
track and these guys pulled and they 

581
00:29:38,791 --> 00:29:42,290
were able to get it up to some speed of 
10 kilometers an hours.

582
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:47,330
Wow.
So this is how they move the volume of 

583
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:47,330
the blocks.
Wow.

584
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,360
And it was probably started out,
you know,

585
00:29:49,361 --> 00:29:52,240
they've been building pyramids for a 
thousand years before that.

586
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:56,800
And so there's the famous bending 
pyramid that's like not collapsed,

587
00:29:56,801 --> 00:30:01,801
but about two because they didn't 
understand foundation because you can't 

588
00:30:01,801 --> 00:30:04,240
build a foundation for a pyramid.
It's on sand.

589
00:30:04,241 --> 00:30:06,760
Most of them were.
And by the time of Giza,

590
00:30:06,761 --> 00:30:10,460
they mastered it.
You fill the area with water like you,

591
00:30:10,461 --> 00:30:14,200
you,
you basically packs and down huge area,

592
00:30:14,201 --> 00:30:16,990
acres and acres,
fill it with water.

593
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:21,580
And then the teams would go on,
they would pack the sand up to the level

594
00:30:21,581 --> 00:30:22,780
of the water,
water's flat.

595
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:28,650
And then when they started laying down 
their sort of first case ons that would 

596
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:30,800
evenly compressed the sands is the key 
thing is,

597
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:35,320
is massive compressive strength evenly 
over the area so that the thing will not

598
00:30:35,321 --> 00:30:37,300
abandon fall down.
Wow.

599
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:40,780
And they had to do it so accurately that
over 2 million,

600
00:30:40,781 --> 00:30:45,781
500,000
blocks or could be like such little 

601
00:30:45,781 --> 00:30:47,830
deviation to line up at the top.
And that's so incredible.

602
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:51,130
They learned that these guys had 
mastered a whole field,

603
00:30:51,131 --> 00:30:53,750
which we lost,
which we didn't even know exist.

604
00:30:53,751 --> 00:30:58,751
It's sand hydraulics.
So these guys were literally using 

605
00:30:58,751 --> 00:31:01,720
hydraulic sand is a flowing things like 
water,

606
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,180
right?
You have an hour glass,

607
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:07,660
it looks like water flowing down,
but it's sand and so to,

608
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:10,090
to set keystones,
they would have a column,

609
00:31:10,091 --> 00:31:15,091
a sand get the keystone to the top and 
they would pull plugs out and the sand 

610
00:31:15,251 --> 00:31:20,251
would come down and it would.
The keystone would come down absolutely 

611
00:31:20,251 --> 00:31:23,851
perfectly in the right place.
San Hydraulics sound foundations,

612
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:27,670
clay for slipways smart dudes.

613
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:32,200
Isn't it amazing when you say what you 
said a thousand years like they had been

614
00:31:32,201 --> 00:31:36,370
making pyramids for a thousand years.
We can barely comprehend what a thousand

615
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:41,370
years.
A thousand years to us is like if you 

616
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:43,831
want to go back to 1014,
can we even like Genghis Khan Times for 

617
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:51,100
him?
And of course theater cathedrals took a 

618
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:51,100
thousand years to master.
Right?

619
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,290
So think about the fact that they were 
doing that,

620
00:31:53,291 --> 00:31:54,790
making these things for a thousand 
years.

621
00:31:54,791 --> 00:31:58,750
And even though as far as we know,
they didn't have electronics,

622
00:31:58,751 --> 00:32:01,570
they didn't have computers,
they didn't have any of these things.

623
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:04,690
They still have the human mind,
the human mind,

624
00:32:04,691 --> 00:32:07,290
without electricity,
without engine,

625
00:32:07,291 --> 00:32:12,090
the contemplate of time,
and they had a culture that supported it

626
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,290
well.
They also had this incredible connection

627
00:32:14,291 --> 00:32:19,291
with the cosmos because of the fact that
they weren't dealing with light 

628
00:32:19,291 --> 00:32:22,111
pollution like we are.
We've done a really weird thing in our 

629
00:32:22,111 --> 00:32:22,180
arrogance.
I mean,

630
00:32:22,181 --> 00:32:27,181
it's not arrogant that we did it.
We did it out of innovation that have 

631
00:32:27,181 --> 00:32:30,640
this burning desire to continually 
create new and better things.

632
00:32:30,641 --> 00:32:35,641
But our cities,
which is the giant population centers 

633
00:32:35,641 --> 00:32:39,720
we've ascended essentially cut off our 
view of the cosmos almost entirely is 

634
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:39,900
incredible.
Dan didn't,

635
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,070
and

636
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:43,310
they were entirely invested in not just 
the cosmos,

637
00:32:43,311 --> 00:32:45,680
but there are positions in the cosmos,
the,

638
00:32:45,681 --> 00:32:48,890
the uh,
the astrological charts and where things

639
00:32:48,891 --> 00:32:53,891
lined up and where the,
the shafts in the great pyramid that 

640
00:32:54,111 --> 00:32:57,410
would lead to various constellation and 
then the lay lines of Europe.

641
00:32:57,411 --> 00:33:02,411
And then incredible Denison.
I in August for rent running around 

642
00:33:02,411 --> 00:33:05,360
Macha Picchu and he said,
we've got to find the observatory.

643
00:33:05,361 --> 00:33:08,900
We've got to find the observatory.
And he knows this place pretty well.

644
00:33:08,901 --> 00:33:13,901
I had a wonderful tour of it from him 
and we found it and it has this rock 

645
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:19,030
that has all these angled pieces in and 
it's a star map or a big,

646
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:22,400
big rock multi-tone rock,
but it's carved.

647
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:27,640
So if you look this way,
you're gonna you're gonna position on 

648
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:30,311
this star and position on that star and 
and the and it had a sort of a portal at

649
00:33:30,681 --> 00:33:34,160
the top and this is what's remaining of 
much peaches observatory.

650
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:39,820
So it's like all these people have this 
knowledge gap as long as people stay 

651
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:42,310
alive and they keep innovating,
they,

652
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:46,010
they do it differently than we're 
currently experiencing it right now,

653
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:48,830
but they figured out a way to do it and 
some really intense,

654
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:51,500
very sophisticated way.
And if you compare,

655
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,190
what does that Jamie the observatory,
is that it?

656
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:56,300
Probably.
Yeah,

657
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:00,530
that looks like and the thousands of 
years ago,

658
00:34:00,531 --> 00:34:05,531
right?
This is like at least a thousand years 

659
00:34:05,531 --> 00:34:05,531
ago that much.
Fifteen hundred.

660
00:34:05,531 --> 00:34:05,940
1,400.
Okay.

661
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,340
So less.
Less.

662
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:08,660
Yeah.
In fact,

663
00:34:08,661 --> 00:34:13,661
the Inca complexes,
Dennis and I and our group are running 

664
00:34:13,661 --> 00:34:16,811
around a lot of income complexes,
including peace sack and the other 

665
00:34:16,811 --> 00:34:16,811
places,
and they,

666
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:20,330
those dudes knew how to cut rock so 
perfectly.

667
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:22,370
I mean,
when you know how they did that,

668
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:24,320
you know,
it's not known.

669
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:27,290
They could have used ropes.
Have you ever watched ancient aliens?

670
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:28,040
I,
you know,

671
00:34:28,041 --> 00:34:31,550
I've never seen.
I've never seen that it was alien.

672
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:33,470
Everything's dealings I've ever seen 
that show.

673
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:35,660
I'm a born skeptic.
I'm a Canadian,

674
00:34:35,661 --> 00:34:38,160
so a more skeptical.
Oh,

675
00:34:38,161 --> 00:34:39,860
much more.
Less religious.

676
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:45,030
So where it is,
we have a basically armchair views of 

677
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:49,301
America.
I grew up watching all Canadians who 

678
00:34:49,381 --> 00:34:54,381
have watch America with exhilaration and
horror and admiration of your porch from

679
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:56,210
our porch.
Well,

680
00:34:56,211 --> 00:35:01,211
you know,
they say there's a joke about North 

681
00:35:01,211 --> 00:35:01,211
America,
which is,

682
00:35:01,211 --> 00:35:05,270
there's a three story apartment block in
the middle apartment is this out of 

683
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:08,600
control fricking party and beer bottles 
and crapping thrown.

684
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:12,800
That's America.
In the bottom is Mexico and all the beer

685
00:35:12,801 --> 00:35:15,530
bottles in the crap are falling on that 
apartment.

686
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,670
And up above is Canada and Canadians are
leaning over the balcony scene.

687
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:24,700
Can You keep it down a.
So that's problem was Toronto has rob 

688
00:35:25,431 --> 00:35:25,820
Ford.

689
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:26,660
Oh,
Toronto.

690
00:35:26,661 --> 00:35:28,850
And Arab for.
So that's changing.

691
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:32,180
You're getting more American.
He'll soon be exported.

692
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:34,760
Thinks so.
And we should have him on the show.

693
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:36,770
I would have them on the show.
Absolutely.

694
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,180
I'd them high get an absolute crack 
cocaine.

695
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:44,930
I would smoke crack with them just to 
get them to do it right here on the 

696
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:45,480
show.
Like one drug to get you in trouble.

697
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:49,800
You helped Graham break is fast.
Well he wanted to.

698
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,470
He,
he kept talking about it and I'm like,

699
00:35:52,471 --> 00:35:54,860
you want to try it?
He kept looking over your way.

700
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,420
Come on.
He was great though.

701
00:35:57,421 --> 00:36:02,421
He took a little baby,
hit another little baby hit and then he 

702
00:36:02,421 --> 00:36:05,871
was off to the races.
You can see it like the cannabinoids 

703
00:36:05,871 --> 00:36:08,700
receptors firing and all the words 
flowing hours in his eyes.

704
00:36:08,701 --> 00:36:09,210
And yeah,
he was.

705
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,840
He became like Terrence Well oiled.
Yes.

706
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:14,660
Yeah.
Well it's back to subject this.

707
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:19,750
It is amazing when you think of the fact
that these people did have these 

708
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:24,501
incredibly sophisticated societies,
we just don't recognize them as 

709
00:36:24,501 --> 00:36:28,731
incredibly sophisticated because they 
didn't have electricity because they 

710
00:36:28,731 --> 00:36:31,501
didn't have the combustion engine.
Those are are our benchmarks if you 

711
00:36:31,501 --> 00:36:31,920
don't have that,
you guys are dopes,

712
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:37,190
but meanwhile the reality is they had 
some stuff that we still are perplexed 

713
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:41,691
by some structures that have taken 
decades upon decades of some of the 

714
00:36:42,001 --> 00:36:43,950
greatest archeologists,
geologists,

715
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:48,951
and engineers to try to even get a 
theory as to how they put these things 

716
00:36:49,411 --> 00:36:51,480
together and that's all we've got.
Right?

717
00:36:51,481 --> 00:36:56,481
I mean,
we've got some pretty good information 

718
00:36:56,481 --> 00:36:56,481
on a lot of things like you're talking 
about the sand hydraulics,

719
00:36:56,481 --> 00:36:59,400
but as far as like the ability to go out
and build one right now,

720
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:04,520
good fucking luck,
but like it at one of these ruins so 

721
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:07,080
soon as the Spanish arrived in England 
lands right?

722
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,580
What they did was have the inca knocked 
down their own temples.

723
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:16,690
Oh God.
And then those stones were carried down 

724
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:18,420
fucking white piano to build a Catholic 
cathedrals.

725
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:22,500
Then the next earthquake happened.
The Catholic cathedral is were flattened

726
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,010
and ink and complex.
We're fine,

727
00:37:26,011 --> 00:37:31,011
you know,
because there's 12 to 14 degree angles 

728
00:37:31,011 --> 00:37:34,041
on all the windows.
It's built to survive earthquakes for a 

729
00:37:34,041 --> 00:37:34,860
thousand years.
It's incredible.

730
00:37:34,861 --> 00:37:39,210
And the water channels that has been no 
maintenance for 500 years,

731
00:37:39,211 --> 00:37:44,211
they're still pumping out billions of 
gallons of water for all of these 

732
00:37:44,211 --> 00:37:44,370
firearms.
Amazing,

733
00:37:44,371 --> 00:37:49,080
amazing and and I stood there in awe of 
a 30 ton block.

734
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:54,320
You could see this.
This was above Cusco and this block was 

735
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:54,780
carved like doop,
doop,

736
00:37:54,781 --> 00:37:56,720
doop,
doop and does that mean tube,

737
00:37:56,721 --> 00:37:57,080
tube,
tube,

738
00:37:57,090 --> 00:37:58,990
tube,
angles,

739
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:04,880
angles but flat faces and then there was
a block next to those was perfectly 

740
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:05,790
matched,
I mean no gaps.

741
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:08,590
And then the one down below I set the 
stone.

742
00:38:08,591 --> 00:38:13,591
Mason stood and studied a pile of rocks 
and in his head,

743
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:18,030
because he was such a deep,
profound present engineer expert,

744
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:23,180
he saw the pattern of these rocks and 
how they could fit together with the 

745
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:24,600
least amount of cutting and with 
perfection.

746
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:28,040
These guys had this in their heads and 
they could like bone.

747
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,180
I know cut that.
Take that one.

748
00:38:30,181 --> 00:38:35,181
That's going on the center and then they
had to lift them and they had to cut 

749
00:38:35,181 --> 00:38:35,530
them first and then lift them into 
place.

750
00:38:35,531 --> 00:38:39,160
They had to be perfect.
So this guy had three dimensional mental

751
00:38:39,161 --> 00:38:44,161
acuity that blows our minds.
I mean any kind of world of warcraft 

752
00:38:44,161 --> 00:38:47,971
player couldn't navigate that space.
The three dimensional acuity of these 

753
00:38:47,971 --> 00:38:51,871
people.
Yet it really is incredible when you 

754
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:55,060
think of what has all been accomplished 
long before people invented the Internet

755
00:38:55,061 --> 00:39:00,061
long before people were going to the 
library to get their books on all this 

756
00:39:00,061 --> 00:39:00,061
stuff.

757
00:39:00,061 --> 00:39:00,760
Or maybe they were,
you know,

758
00:39:00,761 --> 00:39:02,710
library of Alexandria,
of course right now,

759
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,700
but it's,
it's thought of as primitive,

760
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:11,930
you know,
we still think of them as primitive and 

761
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:14,251
when you compare the,
the work of John Anthony West and Graham

762
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:20,250
Hancock and Robert Schoch and all these 
geologists and people that are pointing 

763
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:21,130
to all these erosion,
mark's going,

764
00:39:21,131 --> 00:39:26,131
you know,
we might be dealing with some really 

765
00:39:26,131 --> 00:39:27,760
ancient civilization mixed in with some 
other civilizations that are like,

766
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:30,430
well everyone wants to date Egypt around
the same time,

767
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:33,760
but there's a growing movement of people
that are saying you're dealing with some

768
00:39:33,761 --> 00:39:36,440
pretty significantly different 
structures.

769
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:42,430
I know Graham cat covered in your show 
him your last show.

770
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:47,490
It was just fascinating.
Thousands of years of rainfall erosion 

771
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:49,630
in the last time there was rain fall in 
the Nile Valley was 9,000

772
00:39:49,631 --> 00:39:51,100
BC.
And did you know that?

773
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:53,980
When I was visiting the Sphinx about 20 
years ago,

774
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:59,340
our guide said,
did you know that this thing has been 

775
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,160
for 10,000
years?

776
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:05,460
But in the last 15 it has been so 
damaged by Cairo city sanitation 

777
00:40:06,131 --> 00:40:09,460
department raising the water table.
So every he said,

778
00:40:09,461 --> 00:40:14,461
every toilet flushes in the city of 
Cairo is taking a chunk out of the 

779
00:40:14,461 --> 00:40:18,121
interior of the Sphinx.
So we are pumping in paraffin wax to 

780
00:40:18,121 --> 00:40:18,760
keep from coming apart.
So I mean,

781
00:40:18,761 --> 00:40:22,000
look at the destructive power of our 
civilization,

782
00:40:22,001 --> 00:40:27,001
just haphazard and,
and the archeologists that gave us this 

783
00:40:27,001 --> 00:40:30,130
tour of the Giza plateau,
excavation,

784
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:32,560
they,
he said,

785
00:40:32,561 --> 00:40:37,561
look,
here's modern Cairo coming up over top 

786
00:40:37,561 --> 00:40:40,441
of our excavation site.
We can excavate under that notice the 

787
00:40:40,441 --> 00:40:42,130
Warren of chaotic streets and bad 
planning and pad everything.

788
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:45,640
And on top of this beautifully thought 
out,

789
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:51,300
you know,
fully functional city of artisans and 

790
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,140
construction people.
How have we evolved?

791
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:58,200
Tell us the acef fascinating that this 
really wacky city is over one of the 

792
00:41:00,461 --> 00:41:02,350
greatest ancient cities ever.

793
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:06,650
Like Kairos is another example.
Yeah.

794
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:10,750
So how are we evolving exactly while 
we're doing something?

795
00:41:10,751 --> 00:41:13,000
Because the Mexico City during the 
Aztecs,

796
00:41:13,001 --> 00:41:15,430
if they knew what we know now or the 
incose,

797
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:20,670
they would have known the Cortez was an 
asshole and they were shot him and they 

798
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:21,130
would have never thought he was a 
warrior.

799
00:41:21,131 --> 00:41:23,530
That was part God on a horse.
You know,

800
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:28,550
they would have not had any 
misconceptions about him because they 

801
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:28,600
would have known what a horse is.
They would have had the internet.

802
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:32,770
No one horseshit is horseshit,
but yeah,

803
00:41:32,771 --> 00:41:34,100
literally and figuratively.
Right.

804
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:37,190
So here I want to propose you a theory.
Okay.

805
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:41,870
That's kind of captivated me and it's 
partly woo and it's partly science,

806
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:43,750
but it'll really is my favorite stuff.
It's fear.

807
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,840
Favorite stuff.
I like half,

808
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,880
so half of woo.
So yeah,

809
00:41:46,881 --> 00:41:50,350
you got a t shirt that has the blue on 
the front wheel on the backs of you turn

810
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,470
around your woo.
But.

811
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:57,010
So that the Eleusinian mysteries,
you know about the La one and mysteries.

812
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:00,200
Yes.
So they ran for 1700,

813
00:42:00,201 --> 00:42:01,670
1800 years.
They ran,

814
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:06,970
they started out before Greece.
The Greek civilization explain people 

815
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:06,970
what it means,
what it,

816
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:11,960
what it was.
It was a kind of like a burning man or 

817
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:15,430
more serious than I'm burning man was an
initiation ceremony that happened at 

818
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:18,620
elusive in Greece and it was run by 
women,

819
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:21,380
sort of high class women.
They were kind of a monopoly.

820
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,860
And when they finally got this thing 
cranked up,

821
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,140
because we don't know much about the 
earlier history,

822
00:42:27,141 --> 00:42:30,890
but you can go to the temple of a to 
date was destroyed in the fourth century

823
00:42:30,891 --> 00:42:33,470
by characters that I want to bring up 
later.

824
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:39,100
This is why we might be still in the 
culture of the people destroyed 

825
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:39,530
ellipsis.
So they built this thing.

826
00:42:39,531 --> 00:42:44,531
So the fully powered appaloosas theme 
park transformational experience was a 

827
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:52,030
thousand person buried temple could,
could house a thousand initiates buried 

828
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:54,410
under the ground so the people couldn't 
see out.

829
00:42:54,411 --> 00:42:56,480
So they were totally in an internal 
process.

830
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:59,210
The initiates came from all over the 
Mediterranean.

831
00:42:59,211 --> 00:43:02,150
They included Roman emperors,
philosophers,

832
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:07,570
etc.
And you had to go to a loose once in 

833
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:08,570
your life because the thought was you 
then became a human being.

834
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:12,320
So they cAme off their boats,
they landed,

835
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:15,020
they wore the sink garb.

836
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:18,590
They had a fasting diet.
Sound familiar?

837
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:22,440
They say I had a fast ramadan.
It sounds like a.

838
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:27,670
What I would say today,
it sounds like people who are doing 

839
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:30,371
initiatory practice iowasca for example,
people are going to mecca to see people 

840
00:43:30,371 --> 00:43:31,910
wearing the same clothes.
Exactly,

841
00:43:31,911 --> 00:43:36,911
bring them down and so the initiates 
would walk through villages and the 

842
00:43:36,911 --> 00:43:41,651
villages would come out and their job 
was to cat call to to swear and bring 

843
00:43:42,801 --> 00:43:43,710
the people down.
Say,

844
00:43:43,711 --> 00:43:44,990
oh,
you've got a big nose.

845
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:50,220
So,
so if it's a noble person who was a lot 

846
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:50,220
of wealth,
they're getting screamed at by villagers

847
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:52,150
and they get knocked back to la,
knock them there,

848
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:57,160
their ego out and and to dissolve them.
Basically a boundary disillusion 

849
00:43:57,201 --> 00:44:02,201
exercise.
They were walking next to fields which 

850
00:44:02,201 --> 00:44:03,470
had wheat which had tiny mushroom like 
purple.

851
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,950
It's a purple.
I'm a brain is shot today,

852
00:44:06,951 --> 00:44:11,951
but it was basically a rust that would 
grow on the wheat that was used to make 

853
00:44:13,071 --> 00:44:18,071
the chi keon drink that would be given 
to the initiates after nine days or 

854
00:44:18,711 --> 00:44:20,540
eight or eight or nine days.

855
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:23,780
So this was like some ergot based forgot
basis in there.

856
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:26,600
Gotta mean sort of an earth based.
How do we know this?

857
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:29,450
Because I thought that was like a giant 
mystery as to what they were taking.

858
00:44:29,451 --> 00:44:34,451
Like some folks thought that it was 
suicide and some people felt it was an 

859
00:44:34,451 --> 00:44:34,451
erg.
Got beer,

860
00:44:34,451 --> 00:44:36,330
there was some sort of an origami beer,
I mean,

861
00:44:36,331 --> 00:44:41,331
hoffman's book,
he talks about it apparently being in 

862
00:44:41,331 --> 00:44:43,941
ercot beer of some sort,
but there was definitely an inefficient 

863
00:44:43,941 --> 00:44:48,620
potion that was extremely powerful.
But what makes you think that it was 

864
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:49,040
what you're saying?
Um,

865
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:53,310
because you can find this in the area of
alyssa's today.

866
00:44:53,311 --> 00:44:55,020
You can find,
and I'm no expert.

867
00:44:55,021 --> 00:44:56,640
I mean you should have an expert on 
this,

868
00:44:56,641 --> 00:44:59,400
on the show.
I've read a number of books about this,

869
00:44:59,401 --> 00:45:01,710
but,
but when I pieced this together,

870
00:45:01,711 --> 00:45:06,711
so there's a fantastic book called 
psychedelia by patrick lundberg that 

871
00:45:06,711 --> 00:45:07,620
came out last year.

872
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:12,620
He paSsed away.
Unfortunately the author is quite a 

873
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:13,620
young man,
but in the first chapter he details this

874
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:17,220
and what he says is the initiatives 
would come in,

875
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:21,090
they would go into the temple.
They were on this fasting diet,

876
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:24,930
the temple of the people who are running
the temple.

877
00:45:24,931 --> 00:45:29,931
It was sound and music.
It was all factory smoke color and they 

878
00:45:31,351 --> 00:45:35,250
were driven to this intense state.
And then they were given the kike ian.

879
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:37,200
And I think they,
you know,

880
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:42,610
a philosophy,
greek philosophers and others have 

881
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:44,901
written about their experience it 
appaloosas and they would emerge a 

882
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:49,320
really an incredible,
maybe they got incredibly high,

883
00:45:49,321 --> 00:45:52,830
maybe their boundaries or dissolve,
but they emerged with visionary,

884
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:55,590
uh,
coming back with vision of what to do,

885
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:58,500
what to do in their world.
and when they,

886
00:45:58,530 --> 00:46:01,710
when they went home,
they boarded their ships and whatnot and

887
00:46:01,711 --> 00:46:02,190
they went home.

888
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:04,020
And what did we see happening in that 
period?

889
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,390
Greek theatre,
mathematics.

890
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:10,980
The academy road construction had 
hydraulics,

891
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:16,380
uh,
the idea of a city organizational 

892
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:17,190
structure,
the republic,

893
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:20,310
the idea of polity,
the idea of representation.

894
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:25,680
And the indian mystery school was just 
one of many that were going on.

895
00:46:25,681 --> 00:46:27,510
But ellis was a big deal,
right?

896
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:31,260
Looses was,
was destroyed partly in some periods and

897
00:46:31,261 --> 00:46:33,360
then a roman emperor would,
would reboot it.

898
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:35,040
And,
and finally,

899
00:46:35,041 --> 00:46:40,041
and I think it was the end of the fourth
century coming in from the north were 

900
00:46:40,041 --> 00:46:44,661
sort of the savage germanic tribes that 
were basically taken out the whole 

901
00:46:44,661 --> 00:46:49,161
western roman empire.
And guess who was coming in from The 

902
00:46:49,161 --> 00:46:51,660
east black robed christians were 
described as,

903
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:57,140
you know,
cranky fellows with a real sort of 

904
00:46:57,140 --> 00:47:01,250
obsessive perfectionist,
reductionist kind of negative.

905
00:47:01,771 --> 00:47:03,960
They were described as really nasty 
characters.

906
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:08,040
They formed this compact and together 
they destroyed the temple.

907
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:11,340
That elusive.
So my woo woo theory is,

908
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:16,380
are we living in an inferior culture 
that has no initiation,

909
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:21,090
replacing initiation,
powerful initiation with what you know,

910
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:24,840
all these other structures of,
of abuse and usury,

911
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:27,090
church structures,
corporate structures,

912
00:47:27,091 --> 00:47:30,930
commercial structures.
Are we juvenile in?

913
00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:35,950
Are we were we made juvenile?
But the fact that we didn't have a 

914
00:47:35,950 --> 00:47:39,841
powerful initiatory experience at 
dissolved our boundaries that that 

915
00:47:39,841 --> 00:47:43,621
opened us to vision that that made us 
human beings certainly think that's very

916
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,240
arguable.
It makeS a lot of sense.

917
00:47:46,510 --> 00:47:47,020
I mean,
if you,

918
00:47:47,021 --> 00:47:50,170
if you compare our resources to their 
resources,

919
00:47:50,171 --> 00:47:53,380
what we've accomplished and what we've 
managed to fuck up in comparison to what

920
00:47:53,381 --> 00:47:58,381
they managed to create with no 
combustion engine with no hydraulics 

921
00:47:58,381 --> 00:48:02,491
with them,
of course they had slave cultures and 

922
00:48:02,491 --> 00:48:02,491
there were a lot of,
here's,

923
00:48:02,491 --> 00:48:05,260
here's the other thing and you should 
ask graham when he's next on that.

924
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:07,240
I'd love to,
to hear his response to this.

925
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:11,070
What did you have before the rise of 
civilization?

926
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:14,950
Especial in The mediterranean,
you have the upper paleolithic,

927
00:48:14,951 --> 00:48:19,951
you had village cultures.
Tribal cultures had quite a bit of 

928
00:48:19,951 --> 00:48:23,431
conflict but quite a bit of advancement,
but that was thousands and thousands of 

929
00:48:23,771 --> 00:48:28,771
years and then suddenly and for sure 
they had some kInd of initiatory 

930
00:48:28,871 --> 00:48:33,871
experience for their youth,
especially for young man because as we 

931
00:48:33,871 --> 00:48:33,940
know,
you know in,

932
00:48:34,090 --> 00:48:37,240
in,
excuse me,

933
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:42,630
in cultures of indigenous cultures that 
still have an initiatory practice.

934
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:47,110
I think that's a very important part of 
life.

935
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:52,320
Having some very clear graduation 
pRocess and we have it throughout 

936
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:55,270
schools.
We have it in grade school,

937
00:48:55,450 --> 00:48:57,850
we have it in martial arts,
martial arts,

938
00:48:58,870 --> 00:49:01,900
jujitsu and martial arts is where we're 
bringing it back,

939
00:49:01,901 --> 00:49:05,610
right?
Strong initiation because you know,

940
00:49:05,810 --> 00:49:09,340
you probably see this because the people
that haven't had that,

941
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:14,170
they think cruz a loss and they know the
ones that have been very apparent,

942
00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:16,330
you know,
pampered and helicopter parenting.

943
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:21,330
We all talk about thIs and they now 
talking about the hoop jumping circus 

944
00:49:21,330 --> 00:49:26,041
train circus pig.
Kids that upper middle class parents 

945
00:49:26,041 --> 00:49:26,800
say,
jump through this hoop,

946
00:49:26,801 --> 00:49:28,060
jump through this hoop,
you know,

947
00:49:28,061 --> 00:49:33,061
there are three or four years old and 
they're jumping through these hoops 

948
00:49:33,061 --> 00:49:35,311
because why?
Because they're being prepped to get 

949
00:49:35,311 --> 00:49:38,341
into top level university.
And so they jumped through all these 

950
00:49:38,341 --> 00:49:42,511
hoops and there's a,
a professor at harvard written the book 

951
00:49:42,511 --> 00:49:45,391
about all this and he said he's watched 
and his incoming classes of these kids 

952
00:49:45,391 --> 00:49:47,320
that are really good at achieving the 
goals,

953
00:49:47,321 --> 00:49:50,260
but they can't deal with ambiguity.
They can't deal With irony.

954
00:49:50,261 --> 00:49:52,300
They can deal with creatIvity,
creativity.

955
00:49:52,510 --> 00:49:54,340
They just living outside of the box.
Right?

956
00:49:54,341 --> 00:49:56,350
So they're gonna jump to,
you know,

957
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:59,740
the investment bank or.
But they're not very functional,

958
00:49:59,741 --> 00:50:04,741
so because they've not had a practice of
initiation and if not have a leveling 

959
00:50:05,741 --> 00:50:07,690
practice of boundary dissolving 
practice.

960
00:50:07,690 --> 00:50:11,380
They've been in this programmatic 
evolution and it's dangerous.

961
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:16,450
I think that there should be some sort 
of graduation process for various stages

962
00:50:16,451 --> 00:50:21,451
in your life that sort of establish the 
fact that you've learned from your 

963
00:50:21,451 --> 00:50:22,360
mistakes you've grown,
you've achieved in,

964
00:50:22,361 --> 00:50:27,361
you've gotten through some.
You've overcome some adversity in your 

965
00:50:27,361 --> 00:50:30,421
higher.
I got it through scouting and Canada 

966
00:50:30,421 --> 00:50:32,591
because we had a total wilderness 
situations where we have a bunch of us 

967
00:50:33,021 --> 00:50:35,090
almost died a couple times.
You know,

968
00:50:35,091 --> 00:50:40,091
we are out in 45 bulleit below a 
cracking cold january and we were in a 

969
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:46,400
snowshoe can hike with a 60 pounds of 
birch bark vog logs in our backpacks to 

970
00:50:48,231 --> 00:50:51,230
tough on ourselves.
It was just during no adults and we were

971
00:50:51,231 --> 00:50:53,190
climbing over a mountain range and we 
this,

972
00:50:53,191 --> 00:50:55,970
the cold snap came in and I remember,
like I said,

973
00:50:55,971 --> 00:50:57,890
we're this close to hypothermic.

974
00:50:57,890 --> 00:51:02,890
Somebody dying in this group of like six
or eight of us or 14 years old,

975
00:51:03,021 --> 00:51:08,021
whatever.
Because I went out to take a leak one 

976
00:51:08,021 --> 00:51:08,021
night and you can imagine you're wearing
jeans.

977
00:51:08,021 --> 00:51:08,900
I mean this is the seventies,
you know,

978
00:51:08,901 --> 00:51:11,420
we don't have proper clothes even.
And I took,

979
00:51:11,421 --> 00:51:14,750
I sat down on this rock and I took a 
leak and then I came back,

980
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:16,450
pass him the next day.
I mean my,

981
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:21,490
my piss was freezing on the way out and 
I realize it's a dead stallion is 

982
00:51:21,490 --> 00:51:24,860
frozen,
solid wildhorse frozen solid,

983
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:26,150
you know,
dead.

984
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:28,050
And it was a rock.
I thought it was there.

985
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:31,310
I sat on it and we saw wolves and they 
were really skinny,

986
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:32,330
you know,
in the distance.

987
00:51:32,331 --> 00:51:35,540
And we realIze we are really close to 
this is,

988
00:51:35,570 --> 00:51:40,570
you know,
if somebody goes into hypothermic shock 

989
00:51:40,570 --> 00:51:40,910
in that environment,
you're done,

990
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:46,000
you're done.
And another time we were hiking on the 

991
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,611
west coast trail and vancouver island.
We made a wrong turn and the whole 

992
00:51:48,611 --> 00:51:49,400
group,
we found ourselves in this,

993
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:52,880
you know,
this rock outcropping with a tide coming

994
00:51:52,881 --> 00:51:57,881
in and storm surge and we had to cling 
onto this thing all night and we 

995
00:51:57,881 --> 00:52:02,260
couldn't set up any kind of camp.
And it was like those were important 

996
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:02,690
experiences,

997
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:05,030
rights of passage,
overcome adversity,

998
00:52:05,031 --> 00:52:10,031
all those different things.
I think they should probably be 

999
00:52:10,031 --> 00:52:10,031
engineered into our cultures and our 
communities.

1000
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:12,140
I have a theory that goes along with 
your theory.

1001
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:17,440
I think your theory is probably 
absolutely correct that we are a in some

1002
00:52:17,631 --> 00:52:20,390
ways less sophisticated or less advanced
society,

1003
00:52:20,391 --> 00:52:25,391
at least less what will we will most 
certainly more materialistic,

1004
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:33,311
right?
Most certainly more dependent upon the 

1005
00:52:33,311 --> 00:52:33,410
internet and most certainly more 
dependent upon computers.

1006
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:36,890
Technology.
I have a theory about people,

1007
00:52:36,891 --> 00:52:40,190
and this is a very,
very shaky,

1008
00:52:40,370 --> 00:52:45,370
but here's my theory.
My theory is I think that everything is 

1009
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:48,671
natural and I think that all behavior 
like wolves chasing out the beta and the

1010
00:52:49,431 --> 00:52:52,100
alpha taking over,
I think like,

1011
00:52:52,430 --> 00:52:54,410
you know,
birds of prey,

1012
00:52:54,411 --> 00:52:59,411
feasting on other birds and bears eating
salMon and all these complex ecosystems 

1013
00:53:00,381 --> 00:53:01,430
that we see all over the world.

1014
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:05,180
We just accept them as being natural 
because they're a part of the world that

1015
00:53:05,181 --> 00:53:06,920
we didn't alter.
But ourselves,

1016
00:53:06,921 --> 00:53:10,580
we don't look as natural because we've 
altered ourselves.

1017
00:53:10,850 --> 00:53:15,350
But I think we are entirely natural and 
I think our society and our civilization

1018
00:53:15,351 --> 00:53:20,351
and our as fucked up as it is,
it's also natural and I think the 

1019
00:53:20,351 --> 00:53:24,620
purpose that it serves is we live to 
give birth to technology.

1020
00:53:24,970 --> 00:53:29,970
Marshall mcluhan said that human beings 
are the sex organs and the machine will 

1021
00:53:29,970 --> 00:53:33,921
hold.
And I think that what we're doing right 

1022
00:53:33,921 --> 00:53:35,370
now by our obsession with the newest 
greatest iphone,

1023
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:39,240
elon musk just released a tesla that 
goes zero to 60 in two seconds.

1024
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:40,560
Oh my god.
It's amazing.

1025
00:53:40,561 --> 00:53:45,561
I have to have it.
And by continuing to be obsessed with 

1026
00:53:45,561 --> 00:53:48,120
acquiring the latest and greatest 
gadgets,

1027
00:53:48,121 --> 00:53:50,340
we push that innovation further and 
further.

1028
00:53:50,341 --> 00:53:55,341
We fuel it with money and that 
eventually it's going to give birth to 

1029
00:53:55,341 --> 00:53:56,370
an artificial life form.
It's inEvitable.

1030
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,100
I think it will give birth to the next 
thing.

1031
00:53:59,310 --> 00:54:04,050
and I think we are like a caterpillar 
that is becoming a butterfly and we have

1032
00:54:04,051 --> 00:54:06,960
no idea what we're doing.
We're just in the middle of doing it and

1033
00:54:06,961 --> 00:54:08,190
we're just like,
oh,

1034
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:13,240
so much better.
Back in the old days when we chopped 

1035
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:15,111
wood.
And the reason why we think that is 

1036
00:54:15,111 --> 00:54:16,860
because we know inevitably that we are,
we're not going to last.

1037
00:54:17,070 --> 00:54:22,070
We know that it's just a matter of x 
amount of time before we're were 

1038
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:23,760
outdated.

1039
00:54:24,050 --> 00:54:26,030
Here's something not get to.
And I,

1040
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:29,460
I believe you're right.
And here's a nugget to add for you.

1041
00:54:29,461 --> 00:54:33,270
That goes back to our deepest history.
This goes to my practice.

1042
00:54:33,271 --> 00:54:38,271
I do what I call indogenous visioning.
Sometimes in science is called thought 

1043
00:54:38,271 --> 00:54:42,171
experiments or get duncan experiments.
But I can close my eyes mostly closed 

1044
00:54:42,171 --> 00:54:46,701
eyes and I could go into worlds and 
that's what I've been using to design 

1045
00:54:46,701 --> 00:54:48,630
the spacecraft for nasa and origin of 
life.

1046
00:54:48,631 --> 00:54:53,631
I work in the origin of life field and I
sort of visualize molecular storms and 

1047
00:54:53,631 --> 00:54:58,191
flows and all that stuff because I have 
this practice of just doing it and I'm 

1048
00:54:58,340 --> 00:55:03,270
not taking anything just doing it.
And what happened about two years ago,

1049
00:55:03,271 --> 00:55:06,770
I was reading an article in science that
all.

1050
00:55:06,771 --> 00:55:11,771
It was an article.
It was about as like we found a femur 

1051
00:55:11,771 --> 00:55:14,901
bone that was this small,
just a few send parsh portion of a 

1052
00:55:15,751 --> 00:55:17,430
centimeter,
a female meters.

1053
00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:22,430
It's like quarter of an inch long or 
half an inch long and that it's a femur 

1054
00:55:22,501 --> 00:55:25,890
bone from our ancestors.
The ancestors of all monkeys,

1055
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:27,780
primates,
lemurs,

1056
00:55:27,781 --> 00:55:29,810
all of them,
all of us students.

1057
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:34,880
It's our common ancestor is $55,
million years old and then they had an 

1058
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:38,930
artist's conception of this thing that 
would've been about two inches long and 

1059
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:40,590
they said,
well,

1060
00:55:40,830 --> 00:55:44,580
our ancestor lived in the forest canopy 
and ate insects.

1061
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:48,090
We are insectivores.
So I closed my eyes and I said,

1062
00:55:48,270 --> 00:55:49,950
okay,
I want to go back there.

1063
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:54,930
I want to do an endogenous thought 
experiment in science and see what comes

1064
00:55:54,931 --> 00:55:59,931
in from the ether.
What was our life like fan because 

1065
00:55:59,931 --> 00:56:01,890
that's a big clue of who we are and 
where we're going.

1066
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:07,520
And I had this go into a kind of a dream
state serve meditation and breath work 

1067
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:12,261
and when I go into the dream state and I
see this branch at dawn and this a ball,

1068
00:56:12,990 --> 00:56:16,560
a ball of us all clumped together 
because insectivores,

1069
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:21,680
they protect each other by going close 
warmth and all that stuff.

1070
00:56:22,590 --> 00:56:27,590
And I watched as this young proto 
primate polar herself away from the 

1071
00:56:27,671 --> 00:56:32,671
ball.
So story always comes to me to do this 

1072
00:56:32,671 --> 00:56:36,001
kind of shit.
And she's creeping out on the limb at 

1073
00:56:36,001 --> 00:56:36,160
dawn.
Why?

1074
00:56:36,161 --> 00:56:39,280
Because she sees a glistening globule of
something.

1075
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:42,010
and why is this important?
Because that's sugar.

1076
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:47,040
That's tree sap that comes out at night 
and the diet of these insectivores are 

1077
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:52,480
uh,
leaves and flowers and stuff and 

1078
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:55,411
catching like a dragon fly,
which is a major kill for protein and 

1079
00:56:55,411 --> 00:56:57,370
sucking down tree sap.
So it's like fries,

1080
00:56:57,371 --> 00:57:02,230
a burger and a shake diet.
Let's our diet and an incentive or diet.

1081
00:57:02,950 --> 00:57:06,960
And she's creeping out on the limb and 
she's sucking down this glob.

1082
00:57:06,961 --> 00:57:11,961
You'll have sweet.
And one eye is looking back to see if 

1083
00:57:11,961 --> 00:57:13,720
the somebody in the community notices 
her because she'll get busted,

1084
00:57:14,170 --> 00:57:19,170
sound familiar the other eyes looking 
forward on the limb and it sees this 

1085
00:57:19,241 --> 00:57:23,470
very trippy scale pattern,
this trippy pattern of color.

1086
00:57:24,070 --> 00:57:26,440
She doesn't know what it is,
but what it is,

1087
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:31,860
it's a tree snake.
And the tree snake was this sole giant 

1088
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:36,760
predator that survived the impact in 
Mexico that killed the dinosaurs.

1089
00:57:36,761 --> 00:57:39,880
And then we rose after that.
Although he may have been earlier,

1090
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:43,720
the tree snake is on the branch waiting 
for her,

1091
00:57:44,410 --> 00:57:49,410
waiting for her and she.
So she's getting high on all this sugar 

1092
00:57:49,410 --> 00:57:53,130
because we still get high on sugar.
Here we are drinking our coffees right 

1093
00:57:53,130 --> 00:57:55,450
with our sugar.
And she's watching that and that trees,

1094
00:57:55,510 --> 00:57:58,570
that pattern of scales is evolve to 
mesmerize her.

1095
00:57:59,470 --> 00:58:02,770
It's totally there to captivate her.
Why?

1096
00:58:02,771 --> 00:58:06,880
Because of the head is under the branch.
The head is about to come up.

1097
00:58:07,210 --> 00:58:09,400
If she doesn't snap out of and leap 
back,

1098
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:14,650
it will snap her ass down.
So this happened for tens of millions of

1099
00:58:14,650 --> 00:58:16,000
years.
This is coevolution.

1100
00:58:16,450 --> 00:58:17,770
What I believe from that.

1101
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:20,800
That vision that I had was I said,
Oh my god,

1102
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:26,220
this is why we're mesmerized by screens.
We're the only animal that is mesmerized

1103
00:58:26,830 --> 00:58:31,170
by this screening of a phone or you 
know,

1104
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:33,610
texture patterns,
movies,

1105
00:58:33,611 --> 00:58:36,940
moving images.
It's totally hardwired into us.

1106
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:38,860
We're also terrified of snakes.
I mean,

1107
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:43,890
we have a hardwired circuit in our brain
that if you see something that looks 

1108
00:58:43,890 --> 00:58:44,260
like a snake,
you just jumped in voluntarily,

1109
00:58:44,830 --> 00:58:45,910
right?
That's in there too.

1110
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:51,240
I thought that serpent on that limb,
that coa evolved our brain to vision.

1111
00:58:52,750 --> 00:58:57,750
That gave us color vision.
That gave us a three d high acuity,

1112
00:58:58,290 --> 00:59:03,290
a vision that we were talking about the 
ancient peoples because we could see 

1113
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:04,000
incredible pattern.
Why?

1114
00:59:04,001 --> 00:59:07,480
BecauSe we evolved for for $30 million 
years with those guys.

1115
00:59:07,990 --> 00:59:10,870
We had to solve that problem and the 
evolution for 30 million years.

1116
00:59:10,871 --> 00:59:11,920
That's a lot of time.

1117
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:16,920
It's a lot of programming,
so a lot of brain development because 

1118
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:19,651
the ones that got snapped down weren't 
as good and so good old fashioned 

1119
00:59:19,651 --> 00:59:22,940
darwinian evolution and I sometimes have
these conversations with what did I call

1120
00:59:22,941 --> 00:59:23,510
them,
andre,

1121
00:59:23,511 --> 00:59:28,511
so I know mother nature or the guy in 
planetary plant bolus and I said to her 

1122
00:59:29,391 --> 00:59:30,230
at one point,
I said,

1123
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:35,500
you co,
you use this technique to evolve us to 

1124
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:39,821
evolve our vision so we could drive cars
and we could create media and all this 

1125
00:59:39,821 --> 00:59:42,920
sort of stuff,
but it is now coiled around the planet,

1126
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:45,560
technologies,
coil around the planet,

1127
00:59:46,130 --> 00:59:48,910
squeezing out the lifeblood of the 
planet.

1128
00:59:48,911 --> 00:59:51,800
And I asked her,
does this bother you?

1129
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:53,690
And she said,
no,

1130
00:59:53,691 --> 00:59:58,691
as long as you do the prerogative of my 
prerogative of life's prerogative,

1131
00:59:59,990 --> 01:00:03,500
find me a new home.
I must make a copy.

1132
01:00:03,650 --> 01:00:05,780
So what life does this,
this,

1133
01:00:05,970 --> 01:00:08,300
this planet is a womb and it's a two k.

1134
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:10,860
This is all just a crazy vision.
You crazy vision.

1135
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:15,710
It's a womb and attune to home.
You're talking about space travel,

1136
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:18,310
interplanetary space travel.
Yeah.

1137
01:00:18,311 --> 01:00:23,311
And what we've done as a species in it.
So I do a lot of this work for nasa of 

1138
01:00:23,311 --> 01:00:27,030
designing strange space,
craft and art.

1139
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:32,090
Exactly.
Is your educational background when it 

1140
01:00:32,090 --> 01:00:32,090
comes to that stuff?
That stuff?

1141
01:00:32,090 --> 01:00:32,090
It was,
you know,

1142
01:00:32,090 --> 01:00:34,610
it was started out as good old usc 
trojan,

1143
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:37,400
you know,
graduating in electrical engineering and

1144
01:00:37,401 --> 01:00:42,401
the eighties.
But of course there was hardly any 

1145
01:00:42,401 --> 01:00:43,700
software out at that time and I was 
trying to do artificial life in 1987.

1146
01:00:43,701 --> 01:00:48,701
Can you imagine this on computers at usc
connected to the arpanet and it was too 

1147
01:00:49,251 --> 01:00:54,251
soon.
So I restarted at 22 years later and I 

1148
01:00:54,251 --> 01:00:56,510
made a project called the evil grid but 
it was too fricking soon.

1149
01:00:56,511 --> 01:00:56,760
So I.

1150
01:00:56,770 --> 01:00:59,870
So you're kind of like the,
like the virtual reality.

1151
01:00:59,871 --> 01:01:01,970
People were also too soon.
They were.

1152
01:01:01,971 --> 01:01:06,971
And in 1993,
94 we all read snow crash and we read 

1153
01:01:07,510 --> 01:01:10,760
near romancer and all those sorts of 
things and we watched a,

1154
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:16,240
you know,
a minority report and all that sort of 

1155
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:19,691
stuff.
But I actually started organizations to 

1156
01:01:19,691 --> 01:01:22,340
kickstart virtual worlds on the internet
in 94 95.

1157
01:01:22,341 --> 01:01:23,780
And we have the first conference that I 
wrote,

1158
01:01:23,781 --> 01:01:28,781
a book called avatars and help to 
network together and get all these 

1159
01:01:28,781 --> 01:01:30,680
people in the same room that we're 
filming avatar,

1160
01:01:30,681 --> 01:01:33,530
cyberspace and three dimensional,
you know,

1161
01:01:33,531 --> 01:01:38,531
move through and you see objects,
fish and people and whatever and they 

1162
01:01:38,531 --> 01:01:39,260
talk to you and et cetera,
et cetera.

1163
01:01:39,261 --> 01:01:41,240
And that's how I got connected with 
terrence.

1164
01:01:41,570 --> 01:01:44,630
Terrence mckenna,
this terrance was fascinated by that.

1165
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:47,480
And I was the go to guy.
So he came,

1166
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:52,900
he came to the farm and sat at our 
little table and I put them into these 

1167
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:55,820
virtual worlds,
but it was an amazingly powerful medium.

1168
01:01:56,540 --> 01:02:00,800
And then we spun that medium into all 
this work for nasa for 12 years.

1169
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:04,340
Using virtual worlds to model the 
surface of mars,

1170
01:02:04,341 --> 01:02:07,430
for example,
and a rover and how it would work.

1171
01:02:07,431 --> 01:02:12,431
The rigid body dynamics of wheels 
driving in bulldozers on the moon and 

1172
01:02:13,131 --> 01:02:15,560
stuff like that.
And how do we build moon basis.

1173
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:18,980
But we could use three d graphics,
you know the serpent.

1174
01:02:19,020 --> 01:02:24,020
Again,
our ability to create these worlds to 

1175
01:02:24,020 --> 01:02:27,510
figure out how a vehicle would work on 
another planet before we built.

1176
01:02:27,630 --> 01:02:30,660
We built banta any metal,
but it turns out,

1177
01:02:30,661 --> 01:02:33,030
coming back to the life propagation 
thing,

1178
01:02:33,690 --> 01:02:38,690
if you go to the curiosity rover or the 
two rovers on mars and you take you a 

1179
01:02:38,851 --> 01:02:40,410
screw gun,
if you were there,

1180
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:45,680
you know,
hopefully the vehicles are dead so 

1181
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:45,680
you're not caught on camera,
but you.

1182
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:48,630
You drop the belly pan off of them 
inside.

1183
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:53,610
There's a dozen species of bacteria that
are just there for the ride.

1184
01:02:53,611 --> 01:02:57,620
They're inside the vehicles.
They can't be knocked out any clean room

1185
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:00,840
and they're dry,
but there are life,

1186
01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:06,020
so there's life on mars is.
This happens to be in the bodies of our 

1187
01:03:06,020 --> 01:03:09,501
space craft,
so there's no way avoid to avoid that 

1188
01:03:09,501 --> 01:03:09,501
really no way.
There's no way to.

1189
01:03:09,501 --> 01:03:14,480
And there's certain species of bacteria 
that will always be present and in fact 

1190
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:17,691
the jpl vacuum chamber and where they do
the final prep for some of these 

1191
01:03:17,691 --> 01:03:20,610
missions.
They found that because they had created

1192
01:03:20,611 --> 01:03:25,611
the vacuum chamber and the clean rooms,
certain types of bacteria evolved to be 

1193
01:03:26,101 --> 01:03:29,640
good at living in those.
So they already good at hitching a ride.

1194
01:03:30,030 --> 01:03:35,030
So of course they're inside the vehicle 
on there on mars now outside of the 

1195
01:03:35,030 --> 01:03:37,170
vehicle,
there's radiation and stuff that make it

1196
01:03:37,171 --> 01:03:41,100
impossible for them to really spread and
get into soils and stuff where there was

1197
01:03:41,101 --> 01:03:41,340
a

1198
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:46,700
fascinating podcasts from radio lab 
about the galapagos islands and about 

1199
01:03:47,910 --> 01:03:52,140
how many invasive species have found the
way to the galapagos,

1200
01:03:52,170 --> 01:03:57,170
even from just the heels of people's 
feet having seeds ground into their 

1201
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:03,520
pattern of their shoes and that 
sometimes the seeds will get into these 

1202
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:06,780
grounds and then these invasive species 
will start growing and

1203
01:04:07,190 --> 01:04:10,430
and jeff goldbloom and jurassic park,
he says,

1204
01:04:10,431 --> 01:04:13,340
life will find a way out or something 
like that.

1205
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:14,670
What they were trying to say is

1206
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:19,490
there really is no clean.
Like this idea that you're not going to.

1207
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:25,080
That a human being entering into some 
particular environment is going to not 

1208
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:26,900
leave a footprint like it's not.
It's not happening.

1209
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:29,270
You know that just by virtue of you 
being there,

1210
01:04:29,271 --> 01:04:30,930
your bacteria or disease and we're

1211
01:04:30,930 --> 01:04:33,680
carrying around in a single celled 
organisms,

1212
01:04:33,690 --> 01:04:38,690
bacteria to help us digest food and 
stuff and that the body load of that 

1213
01:04:38,690 --> 01:04:43,551
stuff out.
Numbers of the number of humans that 

1214
01:04:43,551 --> 01:04:44,160
have ever lived,
we're just in some sense,

1215
01:04:44,370 --> 01:04:47,670
here's a joke for you.
So we come,

1216
01:04:47,671 --> 01:04:50,010
we rise,
we don't do the deed,

1217
01:04:50,011 --> 01:04:53,730
we don't create life off the pilot.
We just sort of go away.

1218
01:04:54,030 --> 01:04:56,880
Planet goes on,
runs down 5 billion years from now,

1219
01:04:56,881 --> 01:05:01,370
the sun is a is a red giant and it's 
expanding and and we come,

1220
01:05:01,410 --> 01:05:06,410
the earth comes and it scrapes the outer
corona and it starts breaking apart 

1221
01:05:06,410 --> 01:05:09,990
because that's probably what happened 
and the crust comes apart.

1222
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:15,260
Now of course we know that bacteria can 
survive and all these crustal rocks on 

1223
01:05:15,260 --> 01:05:16,980
maybe traveled to other source systems,
but my prediction,

1224
01:05:17,140 --> 01:05:20,350
the surface bacteria will say,
hey guys,

1225
01:05:20,351 --> 01:05:23,830
and the ones that are five kilometers 
down or three miles down said,

1226
01:05:24,070 --> 01:05:28,450
hey guys,
listen around a billion years ago or 600

1227
01:05:28,450 --> 01:05:33,450
million years ago,
there was all this surface gigantic 

1228
01:05:33,450 --> 01:05:34,540
plants and labels and dinosaurs and 
stuff,

1229
01:05:34,541 --> 01:05:39,541
and there was one species that did 
technology and they even took it out a 

1230
01:05:39,541 --> 01:05:43,621
little bit and then they just blew it 
and went away in the five kilometer 

1231
01:05:43,621 --> 01:05:43,621
deep.

1232
01:05:43,621 --> 01:05:45,190
A Bacteria will say,
you're kidding.

1233
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:48,490
That was going on.
No one told us,

1234
01:05:48,930 --> 01:05:51,820
you know,
that was happening on the surface.

1235
01:05:51,821 --> 01:05:56,821
We're,
we're used to just being bacteria on 

1236
01:05:56,821 --> 01:05:57,730
planets that never go any further than 
just the bacteria phase.

1237
01:05:58,290 --> 01:06:03,290
Well,
the primary idea about how life gets 

1238
01:06:03,290 --> 01:06:04,860
moved around about the galaxy is 
asteroidal impacts,

1239
01:06:04,861 --> 01:06:08,010
right?
Like the idea of panspermia like that,

1240
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:13,280
much of what is life sustaining exists 
on asteroids can be no acids and water.

1241
01:06:15,870 --> 01:06:17,520
It was,
it was a theory put forth,

1242
01:06:17,521 --> 01:06:20,790
I think in the seventies versus 
initially sort of panned,

1243
01:06:21,330 --> 01:06:26,330
but month now we're discovering media 
rights that have come from mars and 

1244
01:06:26,330 --> 01:06:28,410
landed on ice caps on earth and go in 
and realize,

1245
01:06:28,411 --> 01:06:33,411
no,
it's quite possible that things hitched 

1246
01:06:33,411 --> 01:06:33,990
a ride and that mars would have cooled 
sooner,

1247
01:06:34,290 --> 01:06:39,290
had a liquid ocean,
sort of more stable environment sooner 

1248
01:06:39,290 --> 01:06:43,131
than earth would have.
So if life arose on mars and got some 

1249
01:06:43,131 --> 01:06:45,530
impacts and blew off some crustal 
material than we could be all martians.

1250
01:06:45,740 --> 01:06:46,680
Yeah.
Yeah.

1251
01:06:46,690 --> 01:06:47,770
That was the idea.
Right?

1252
01:06:47,980 --> 01:06:51,190
Well,
if that's the case mean isn't the rover,

1253
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:53,530
uh,
just a very microscopic farmer that.

1254
01:06:53,830 --> 01:06:55,180
I mean,
it's not an asteroid,

1255
01:06:55,181 --> 01:07:00,181
but it is or something that came from 
one body and is now occupying another 

1256
01:07:01,421 --> 01:07:02,680
body and it has life on it.

1257
01:07:02,730 --> 01:07:05,220
So here's the other part of the story.
So perhaps,

1258
01:07:05,221 --> 01:07:10,221
and this is all woo woo,
but the bacteria in the mars rovers are 

1259
01:07:10,221 --> 01:07:12,000
communicating with the maras bacteria 
and saying,

1260
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:13,800
listen,
you know,

1261
01:07:14,490 --> 01:07:19,490
we got life started on the earth.
We went up to a certain point where we 

1262
01:07:19,490 --> 01:07:23,721
had trial of bites and we had deep 
swimming things and they weren't really 

1263
01:07:23,721 --> 01:07:24,660
evolving.
So we ordered an airstrike,

1264
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:28,380
knocked him back and then we got things 
on land that crawled,

1265
01:07:28,770 --> 01:07:31,680
but they just basically all he did was 
eat and shit,

1266
01:07:32,210 --> 01:07:33,690
you know,
and they got big and whatever,

1267
01:07:33,691 --> 01:07:36,330
but they weren't going anywhere.
So we ordered another air strike,

1268
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:40,590
kill off the dinosaurs,
and now we've got this new thing,

1269
01:07:40,591 --> 01:07:45,591
these primate things.
But we don't know if they're really 

1270
01:07:45,591 --> 01:07:48,231
gonna go anywhere.
So we just might order one more air 

1271
01:07:48,231 --> 01:07:48,720
strike.
And to start with arachnids,

1272
01:07:48,721 --> 01:07:50,250
let's,
let's do spiders.

1273
01:07:50,251 --> 01:07:55,251
The next time we gotta we gotta find one
that's going to do the job of getting 

1274
01:07:55,251 --> 01:07:55,400
life spread.
You know,

1275
01:07:55,420 --> 01:08:00,420
so you think that that's where our 
primary objective is to get off this 

1276
01:08:00,420 --> 01:08:00,420
planet and the spread life throughout 
the galaxy.

1277
01:08:00,420 --> 01:08:00,420
See,

1278
01:08:00,420 --> 01:08:05,020
I Think that life life is so powerful.
I mean life it,

1279
01:08:05,130 --> 01:08:10,130
it pushes into new environments from 
early thermal springs on volcanic 

1280
01:08:10,791 --> 01:08:15,791
islands and it figured out this is the 
work I'm doing with my colleagues at uc 

1281
01:08:15,791 --> 01:08:19,601
santa and nasa and elsewhere.
So to try to figure out a model of how 

1282
01:08:19,601 --> 01:08:22,270
life started in those volcanic springs 
in those early on,

1283
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:27,400
we've come up with a model.
We were just actually submitted our 

1284
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:29,890
paper this week on that model,
but life pushes its way in life.

1285
01:08:30,291 --> 01:08:34,100
Had to learn in that model to survive in
the oceans and then it could spread.

1286
01:08:34,101 --> 01:08:37,520
And these little bubbles that are like 
pre early life,

1287
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:40,460
really fragile and don't have much of a 
genome,

1288
01:08:40,820 --> 01:08:43,610
but they can persist long enough.
They can get to the next island.

1289
01:08:43,890 --> 01:08:46,310
You know,
life will find a way like jeff goldbloom

1290
01:08:46,311 --> 01:08:51,311
said,
but look at where life has gone and 

1291
01:08:51,311 --> 01:08:51,311
missing.

1292
01:08:51,311 --> 01:08:53,670
Incredible as you say,
if we are spreading wings of the living 

1293
01:08:53,670 --> 01:08:57,440
system,
we are a magnificent creation of that.

1294
01:08:57,441 --> 01:09:02,441
I mean we're,
we have the potential to spread life 

1295
01:09:02,441 --> 01:09:05,380
everywhere.
And one of the other projects I'm 

1296
01:09:05,380 --> 01:09:06,200
working on asteroid capture and 
retrieval.

1297
01:09:06,890 --> 01:09:08,570
No,
if you're wanting to hear about that.

1298
01:09:09,620 --> 01:09:10,250
Yeah,
sure.

1299
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:13,970
That's a mechanism to actually spread 
life in the large scale.

1300
01:09:14,590 --> 01:09:16,070
You know,
even though it's indirect,

1301
01:09:16,310 --> 01:09:21,310
so you know,
nobody's going to fund a project to 

1302
01:09:21,310 --> 01:09:21,980
spread life into the solar system or not
so visionary,

1303
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:27,100
you know,
we're pretty pedestrian than we do 

1304
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:28,850
things for business reasons or whatever.
So there's this whole new space movement

1305
01:09:28,851 --> 01:09:29,860
that's come up,
you know,

1306
01:09:30,050 --> 01:09:34,130
space x and elon musk,
all these private entrepreneurs.

1307
01:09:34,550 --> 01:09:36,920
They're proposing how to get to mars and
stuff,

1308
01:09:37,250 --> 01:09:39,620
right?
nasa still in the game,

1309
01:09:39,621 --> 01:09:41,570
even though they can't launch people,
you know,

1310
01:09:41,571 --> 01:09:44,030
they're going to be using space x and a 
few years.

1311
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:48,170
So nasa has put out this call for,
well,

1312
01:09:48,171 --> 01:09:50,510
let's see,
what can we do with the human crew?

1313
01:09:50,900 --> 01:09:51,740
Well,
we can,

1314
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:57,100
uh,
back in 2007 when they were going to 

1315
01:09:57,100 --> 01:09:59,930
shut down the shuttle program and that 
was on the books.

1316
01:10:00,470 --> 01:10:05,470
I worked with a team that worked with 
headquarters to design what's possibly 

1317
01:10:05,470 --> 01:10:06,460
the very first,
you know,

1318
01:10:06,470 --> 01:10:10,280
we can even bring up that video,
how to get people to an asteroid,

1319
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:14,300
how to land a human crew using the 
hardware that nasa wanted to build,

1320
01:10:14,301 --> 01:10:16,040
which is called constellation at the 
time.

1321
01:10:16,730 --> 01:10:18,470
And it turns out it's a tricky thing,
you know,

1322
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:20,660
who is it?
The movie,

1323
01:10:20,710 --> 01:10:22,210
the deep impact movie?
Uh,

1324
01:10:22,450 --> 01:10:27,450
you mentioned Bruce Willis.
He had one and the other one was morgan 

1325
01:10:27,450 --> 01:10:27,450
freeman.
There was,

1326
01:10:27,450 --> 01:10:32,080
there was two,
there was a deep Impact and there was 

1327
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:34,070
harm again.
So what we said is,

1328
01:10:34,071 --> 01:10:35,900
you know,
that's all well and good,

1329
01:10:35,901 --> 01:10:37,030
but how do you really do it?

1330
01:10:37,030 --> 01:10:40,550
And it turns out that an asteroid even 
that's a half a mile long,

1331
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:43,160
has almost no gravity.
So you're not,

1332
01:10:43,550 --> 01:10:47,660
you're not actually going to as your 
video that this is it.

1333
01:10:47,661 --> 01:10:49,610
Jamie's put it up here.
Jamie has put it up.

1334
01:10:49,611 --> 01:10:52,940
So there's almost no gravity.
So it's very difficult to land on,

1335
01:10:52,970 --> 01:10:55,730
so that's a really big object,
but then it's going what,

1336
01:10:55,731 --> 01:10:57,530
like 45,000
miles an hour or something.

1337
01:10:57,710 --> 01:10:59,690
Then It's rotating and it's,
you know,

1338
01:10:59,740 --> 01:11:02,150
so it's spinning and it's moving,
it's moving.

1339
01:11:02,151 --> 01:11:07,151
So here's our craft.
So it's like a football because I was 

1340
01:11:07,151 --> 01:11:11,140
like a space potato.
So here we are coming down and we're 

1341
01:11:11,140 --> 01:11:14,110
using our radar to trying to find a spot
that might not be so crumbling because 

1342
01:11:14,110 --> 01:11:16,130
these often rubble piles and this is 
going to be people are going to land.

1343
01:11:16,590 --> 01:11:21,590
This is a human mission.
So let's see the ring of airbags that 

1344
01:11:21,590 --> 01:11:24,940
allows a soft contact,
the vehicles under thrust and it's watch

1345
01:11:24,941 --> 01:11:25,290
this.

1346
01:11:25,770 --> 01:11:28,710
Here comes a penetrator.
Amateurs coming out,

1347
01:11:29,030 --> 01:11:34,030
there's a pen of trauma.
It's like a boom penetrates on the edge 

1348
01:11:34,030 --> 01:11:38,471
of edge of a rope in the penetrate 
amateurs or to try to grapple the 

1349
01:11:38,471 --> 01:11:38,471
surface.
You get tension.

1350
01:11:38,471 --> 01:11:41,370
If you've got tension on three or four 
year lines like a rock climber,

1351
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:43,260
you can.
You've got stability.

1352
01:11:43,620 --> 01:11:46,770
So it actually digs into the surface and
the surface.

1353
01:11:46,771 --> 01:11:48,990
I can anchor and here are the guys 
coming out?

1354
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:50,070
No sir.
They're floating.

1355
01:11:50,130 --> 01:11:52,920
They're coming out on handrails.
They got nice earth flag.

1356
01:11:52,970 --> 01:11:56,280
They're saluting.
This is our design from 2007,

1357
01:11:57,180 --> 01:12:01,260
which was done for a nasa headquarters 
study for the administrator actually.

1358
01:12:01,950 --> 01:12:03,540
And uh,
anyway,

1359
01:12:03,541 --> 01:12:05,370
so that was done.
Uh,

1360
01:12:05,580 --> 01:12:10,580
I unimed barcode it so it was so 
controversial at the time because the 

1361
01:12:10,651 --> 01:12:15,651
whole bush agenda was to go back to the 
moon and this was like another target 

1362
01:12:15,651 --> 01:12:15,651
and I thought,
you know,

1363
01:12:15,651 --> 01:12:20,181
we need to go somewhere else if,
if human beings are going to ever go to 

1364
01:12:20,181 --> 01:12:20,820
mars,
why don't we go to an asteroid?

1365
01:12:21,180 --> 01:12:21,700
No,
this is,

1366
01:12:21,710 --> 01:12:26,710
this was running around the community.
There's sort of an asteroid underground 

1367
01:12:26,710 --> 01:12:30,770
and you know,
our center director was one of those 

1368
01:12:30,770 --> 01:12:31,500
dudes and I was sitting in his office 
and he's a two star general.

1369
01:12:31,770 --> 01:12:32,730
He said,
well you can,

1370
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:36,060
you can go public with it because you 
can't get fired.

1371
01:12:36,510 --> 01:12:37,920
You're know,
you're not a civil servant.

1372
01:12:38,490 --> 01:12:41,130
So I did.
So I lined up space.com

1373
01:12:41,131 --> 01:12:46,131
and seen it and you know,
popular science was on the cover of 

1374
01:12:46,131 --> 01:12:46,410
popular science and we put that out and 
we said,

1375
01:12:46,980 --> 01:12:50,790
here's our study,
here's how we grapple,

1376
01:12:50,810 --> 01:12:55,810
you know,
we'd talk with an asteroid and we get a 

1377
01:12:55,810 --> 01:12:55,810
human crew,
et cetera,

1378
01:12:55,810 --> 01:12:58,941
et cetera.
And that kind of goes into a black hole 

1379
01:12:58,941 --> 01:12:58,941
because,
you know,

1380
01:12:58,941 --> 01:13:02,450
nasa sort of got that kind of 
institutional thing where they do a lot 

1381
01:13:02,450 --> 01:13:05,841
of studies,
but we had done it in public and it 

1382
01:13:05,841 --> 01:13:07,971
actually shaped it,
pushed the space industry as I forgot 

1383
01:13:07,971 --> 01:13:08,250
about is 2007.

1384
01:13:08,820 --> 01:13:09,430
I said,
ah,

1385
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:10,590
you know,
it's out there.

1386
01:13:10,591 --> 01:13:13,830
If you google humans on an asteroid,
it'll come up.

1387
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:16,860
But turns out people were watching that.
I'm looking at that.

1388
01:13:17,170 --> 01:13:20,490
We just put it out there.
And a guy at,

1389
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:25,560
I think it was jpl,
saw that baCk in the day and then he 

1390
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:27,330
designed the next mission.
You sort of an outsider,

1391
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:29,760
the student at the time.
And he said,

1392
01:13:29,820 --> 01:13:31,560
wow,
this is really cool.

1393
01:13:31,590 --> 01:13:33,900
We should be doing it as an agency.
And he came up with,

1394
01:13:34,260 --> 01:13:38,070
couldn't we bring an asteroid closer to 
the earth so the crew doesn't have to go

1395
01:13:38,071 --> 01:13:43,071
so far with what?
LiKe pull it closer to closer to it 

1396
01:13:43,071 --> 01:13:44,490
sounds like a disaster waiting to 
happen.

1397
01:13:44,550 --> 01:13:47,830
Small one,
small disaster or a small asteroid,

1398
01:13:47,831 --> 01:13:49,830
all asteroid,
but you can land on it.

1399
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:55,100
You could,
you could go and sample it like a 

1400
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:57,351
geologist with your hammers,
how big you're talking about when you 

1401
01:13:57,351 --> 01:14:00,201
say small,
literally pretty small between like 12 

1402
01:14:00,201 --> 01:14:02,580
feet and 30 feet long and you could land
on something 30 feet long.

1403
01:14:02,610 --> 01:14:05,520
You couldn't land on that.
You can do what we just saw,

1404
01:14:05,890 --> 01:14:09,990
but the human crew could park next to it
called proximity ops.

1405
01:14:09,991 --> 01:14:12,340
Yet it could park way downstream.
Turnoff.

1406
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:16,510
It's hydrazine jets and send astronauts 
over to to sample it.

1407
01:14:16,660 --> 01:14:21,660
But how do you.
How do you move something like that 

1408
01:14:21,660 --> 01:14:22,120
saved to the orbit of the moon,
which would be a safer place.

1409
01:14:22,630 --> 01:14:27,630
Put a moon around the moon.
So nasa had initiated that challenge 

1410
01:14:27,730 --> 01:14:30,640
based on this work which bounced off 
this.

1411
01:14:30,940 --> 01:14:33,940
This guy who said we need to bring an 
asteroid in the moon.

1412
01:14:33,941 --> 01:14:35,950
And they now they have that as a 
direction.

1413
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:41,640
So a colleague and a me designed a whole
system to do that.

1414
01:14:42,330 --> 01:14:45,210
A system to put an asteroid in orbit

1415
01:14:45,390 --> 01:14:48,690
around the moon.
And here's the neat thing about it.

1416
01:14:49,410 --> 01:14:50,430
We figured out,
here's,

1417
01:14:50,431 --> 01:14:52,590
here's the problem.
You got to one of these asteroids,

1418
01:14:52,591 --> 01:14:53,700
it's a rubble pile.
Most.

1419
01:14:53,820 --> 01:14:56,910
Most of the ones that we're really 
interested in for science,

1420
01:14:56,911 --> 01:14:59,650
right?
For sampling there 5 billion years old,

1421
01:14:59,651 --> 01:15:03,240
there are 4 billion years old.
They're collected rubble piles of pieces

1422
01:15:03,241 --> 01:15:05,280
of the early solar system.
So they're,

1423
01:15:05,610 --> 01:15:07,710
they're fragile.
And why do we know this?

1424
01:15:08,130 --> 01:15:13,130
The asteroid that came in over Russia,
the asteroid that came in over africa 

1425
01:15:13,130 --> 01:15:17,511
last year,
broke up at a certain altitude so we 

1426
01:15:17,511 --> 01:15:20,631
know what pressure took to break it up 
so we know how much you got to push it 

1427
01:15:20,631 --> 01:15:24,320
to break up the thing up because the 
atmosphere did that and then it comes in

1428
01:15:24,321 --> 01:15:26,280
and pieces and rains down.

1429
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:29,190
But isn't the concern that you can't 
predict what happens when you break them

1430
01:15:29,191 --> 01:15:32,190
up and then you might deal with a bunch 
of giant rocks hurling towards earth.

1431
01:15:32,580 --> 01:15:37,580
Yeah.
And that'S why it's really hard to do 

1432
01:15:37,580 --> 01:15:38,760
asteroid deflection by some kind of 
explosive and you're ready to to that.

1433
01:15:38,850 --> 01:15:42,170
They want to just be able to push it or 
put some kind of a webbing on a graph.

1434
01:15:42,180 --> 01:15:44,670
Changes the.
If you put a rag right,

1435
01:15:44,671 --> 01:15:47,310
if you put a webbing on it,
they made us come apart.

1436
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:53,000
You,
you can use something called gravity 

1437
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,221
tractoring,
which is developed by rusty schweickart 

1438
01:15:55,221 --> 01:15:58,071
and ed loo at the un,
a separate separate work that we were 

1439
01:15:58,071 --> 01:16:02,121
doing with them.
They have this idea of flying a 

1440
01:16:02,121 --> 01:16:03,981
spacecraft alongside something and 
gradually the gravity will change the 

1441
01:16:03,981 --> 01:16:08,140
orbit.
What is the purpose of going to an 

1442
01:16:08,140 --> 01:16:08,140
asteroid though,
or especially a human mission,

1443
01:16:08,140 --> 01:16:12,801
like what would be the benefit of having
people go as opposed to having some 

1444
01:16:12,801 --> 01:16:15,711
remote vehicle?
Because it seems like as we get better 

1445
01:16:15,711 --> 01:16:18,600
and better with remote technology,
you would be like a lot more efficient.

1446
01:16:18,601 --> 01:16:20,310
It would save lives and

1447
01:16:20,730 --> 01:16:21,210
well,
here's,

1448
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:23,700
here's the we.
We were asking that same question.

1449
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:27,000
So initially nasa said we want to do 
science.

1450
01:16:27,001 --> 01:16:32,001
We want to take samples off of something
that says old as the earth are older 

1451
01:16:32,001 --> 01:16:33,600
because then for origin of life 
research,

1452
01:16:33,601 --> 01:16:34,890
which I'm involved in,
I get,

1453
01:16:34,980 --> 01:16:39,980
I could get a few pounds of this 
material out from under this space crust

1454
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:46,100
that's on it,
that has protected it for 5 billion 

1455
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:48,390
years or 4 billion years.
That is precious because it was what was

1456
01:16:48,391 --> 01:16:52,140
raininG down in the skies of The early 
earth that was coming down to the little

1457
01:16:52,141 --> 01:16:57,141
ponds where life may have started.
It's like spinning a refrigerator all 

1458
01:16:57,141 --> 01:17:01,161
this time so it's really precious for 
science and figuring out how the solar 

1459
01:17:01,161 --> 01:17:05,511
system came together.
So our design was to go out to the,

1460
01:17:06,780 --> 01:17:08,670
to the asteroid,
up to a thousand tons.

1461
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:12,420
They're all rotating.
They spend one time,

1462
01:17:12,421 --> 01:17:14,540
I'm in something like that and half a 
rotation a minute,

1463
01:17:15,410 --> 01:17:16,940
put a balloon around it.

1464
01:17:17,030 --> 01:17:21,470
Just extend this airbeam enough.
You've ever done any helium balloon like

1465
01:17:21,471 --> 01:17:24,210
high altitude flight?
There's no.

1466
01:17:24,450 --> 01:17:25,310
Oh,
they're incredible.

1467
01:17:25,311 --> 01:17:28,310
I mean,
julian not lives out in santa barbara is

1468
01:17:28,340 --> 01:17:33,340
perHaps the greatest designer of these 
kinds of balloons and he's honored our 

1469
01:17:33,340 --> 01:17:34,430
team for this proposal and he said,
look,

1470
01:17:35,060 --> 01:17:38,110
what you do is you,
you extend these air beams,

1471
01:17:38,150 --> 01:17:38,780
you know,
like the,

1472
01:17:38,781 --> 01:17:42,560
the balloons you have at circus as the 
guy just like blows up along balloon and

1473
01:17:42,561 --> 01:17:46,340
makes a dog out of it for your kid or 
air beams.

1474
01:17:46,540 --> 01:17:51,540
They're the rigid parts.
So you literally go out to the asteroid 

1475
01:17:51,540 --> 01:17:56,200
using xenon gas.
You fill these arab beams and they pull 

1476
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:56,320
your fabric out,
you know,

1477
01:17:56,321 --> 01:17:58,740
and there's a,
there's a folder of a bunch of images of

1478
01:17:58,741 --> 01:18:03,741
the assistant called shepherd I got and 
it will capture the asteroid here.

1479
01:18:04,371 --> 01:18:05,180
It's kind of come out.

1480
01:18:05,190 --> 01:18:07,460
There we go.
You can see that it's hard to.

1481
01:18:08,410 --> 01:18:10,190
So,
so this is a balloon.

1482
01:18:10,340 --> 01:18:13,310
This is literally a balloon captures the
asteroid.

1483
01:18:13,370 --> 01:18:18,190
So the astra is now inside it and it's 
tumbling is rotating and there's the air

1484
01:18:18,191 --> 01:18:23,191
beams.
Those blue things is how the capture 

1485
01:18:23,191 --> 01:18:23,191
works.
And here's the air flow.

1486
01:18:23,191 --> 01:18:25,310
We may leave it on that one and we'll we
can explain what we're doing.

1487
01:18:25,730 --> 01:18:30,440
It turns out that if you inject gas into
this balloon,

1488
01:18:31,130 --> 01:18:34,370
you will gradually slow the tumbling the
asteroid to stop it.

1489
01:18:34,910 --> 01:18:36,980
Now it's stopped.
They've solved.

1490
01:18:36,981 --> 01:18:41,981
One of the big problems of capturing 
asteroids is to get rid of the spin and 

1491
01:18:41,981 --> 01:18:44,810
tumbling because if you can't,
there's all these powerful forces.

1492
01:18:44,811 --> 01:18:48,290
If you try to put a net around that 
would just come apart or terrorists.

1493
01:18:48,291 --> 01:18:49,820
Spacecraft pieces.
Okay,

1494
01:18:49,821 --> 01:18:51,650
so you put a bubble on it.
You capture an asteroid.

1495
01:18:51,650 --> 01:18:52,520
Now what?
Now?

1496
01:18:52,521 --> 01:18:57,521
What is.
You'll notice in our little drawing 

1497
01:18:57,521 --> 01:18:57,521
there,
we start shooting waves,

1498
01:18:57,521 --> 01:19:00,740
the xenon gas at the Back end of it,
which puts a force on it,

1499
01:19:01,030 --> 01:19:04,580
not not a forced to break it up and 
enough force to shove It,

1500
01:19:05,210 --> 01:19:10,210
and then we use the same xenon gas and 
our motor to keep up with it as it moves

1501
01:19:10,790 --> 01:19:13,790
and we can use like sale power.
This is like a sailing ship.

1502
01:19:14,180 --> 01:19:19,180
We can use sale power moving gas to 
change its orbit and to retrieve it and 

1503
01:19:19,180 --> 01:19:24,011
bring it to move it into some other.
Part of the solar system is this 

1504
01:19:24,011 --> 01:19:28,210
potential technology to avoid gigantic 
asteroidal impacts on earth or is it 

1505
01:19:28,210 --> 01:19:29,090
just too small?
This is too small,

1506
01:19:29,091 --> 01:19:33,140
so this is only for examining old rocks 
for an examining on rocks blood.

1507
01:19:33,141 --> 01:19:35,900
It turns out that when we were 
investigating this further,

1508
01:19:35,901 --> 01:19:36,890
we thought,
wait a minute,

1509
01:19:37,370 --> 01:19:39,440
what if we had a piece of a comment?

1510
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:44,880
You know,
comments are coming in the pleiades 

1511
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:44,960
meteor shower and the land.
It's that come in and they give you this

1512
01:19:44,961 --> 01:19:49,760
nice light show in the summer.
That's all valid voluble volatiles.

1513
01:19:50,150 --> 01:19:51,530
That's water,
that's methane.

1514
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:56,620
All this wonderful stuff.
What if you had a chunk of a comment 

1515
01:19:56,620 --> 01:19:57,560
that had all this,
these gases coming off,

1516
01:19:57,590 --> 01:19:59,900
you know the rosetta mission the 
europeans are doing right now,

1517
01:19:59,901 --> 01:20:04,901
they're orbiting one of these gigantic 
comments that has these geysers coming 

1518
01:20:04,901 --> 01:20:07,590
out that's thrust doesn't like a rocket 
thrust.

1519
01:20:08,130 --> 01:20:11,550
What if you could capture a small 
comment from further out,

1520
01:20:11,730 --> 01:20:14,100
put your balloon around it,
capture,

1521
01:20:14,290 --> 01:20:18,720
stop at rotating,
capture all the stuff coming off and use

1522
01:20:18,721 --> 01:20:23,721
it for your engine.
You could then create a moving chunk of 

1523
01:20:24,570 --> 01:20:27,210
the early solar system who came outside 
of,

1524
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:30,570
what if we did this and what if we did 
that and you know,

1525
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:32,490
being able to do it would be cool and 
everything like that.

1526
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:36,660
Will it be the benefit of getting some 5
billion year old rock at a space?

1527
01:20:36,780 --> 01:20:37,200
Oh,
here's.

1528
01:20:37,201 --> 01:20:40,290
And again,
why would you want to do it with people?

1529
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:42,900
Why wouldn't you want to do it remotely 
with machines?

1530
01:20:42,930 --> 01:20:44,490
Well,
here's where the people come in.

1531
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:48,270
So if you can move a basically a wet 
space rock,

1532
01:20:48,570 --> 01:20:52,830
capture all the gases coming out of it.
Concentrate the gases in your tanks.

1533
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:57,150
A human crew can dock with it saying,
you move it to mars,

1534
01:20:57,390 --> 01:20:59,580
to mars orbit,
move it to the Lunar orbit.

1535
01:21:00,060 --> 01:21:05,060
Now you've got a gas station in orbit.
You've got a gas station somewhere in 

1536
01:21:05,060 --> 01:21:06,930
the solar system full of exactly the 
material.

1537
01:21:06,931 --> 01:21:10,680
You need to get a human crew.
They dock with it.

1538
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:12,630
When they get there,
they refill their tanks.

1539
01:21:12,631 --> 01:21:17,631
They now have their return fuel to go 
back to earth and then they fuel their 

1540
01:21:17,631 --> 01:21:20,520
lander and they go down with.
They don't have to carry that stuff.

1541
01:21:20,521 --> 01:21:25,521
You have gas stations,
you have a sustainable space flight 

1542
01:21:25,521 --> 01:21:26,760
system.
That sounds beautiful,

1543
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:28,670
but if you

1544
01:21:28,780 --> 01:21:30,870
don't send people out there,
you don't need that.

1545
01:21:31,170 --> 01:21:36,170
So you're saying we would do this 
because when the people were out there 

1546
01:21:36,170 --> 01:21:40,740
that way we didn't have power,
but if you don't need people out there,

1547
01:21:41,010 --> 01:21:46,010
you don't need this power.
And what would be the benefit of having 

1548
01:21:46,010 --> 01:21:46,410
these people out there other than the 
fact that

1549
01:21:46,550 --> 01:21:51,550
do it?
I think because we're exploring species 

1550
01:21:51,691 --> 01:21:53,240
that are eventually going to want to do 
it.

1551
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:58,640
Right,
but what are we exploring remotely with 

1552
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:00,861
the rover?
Aren't we exploring remotely with 

1553
01:22:00,861 --> 01:22:00,861
voyager?
We're still exploring.

1554
01:22:00,861 --> 01:22:05,280
We're exploring.
the proposition of going to mars is so 

1555
01:22:05,580 --> 01:22:09,150
unbelievably unattractive to me.
Like when I hear that 100,000

1556
01:22:09,151 --> 01:22:11,820
people signed up for mars and I'm like,
well there's 100,000

1557
01:22:11,821 --> 01:22:14,730
people that would just drink draino.
Those are 100,000

1558
01:22:14,731 --> 01:22:17,430
people that would dive into a volcano.
if you can put a camera on them,

1559
01:22:18,030 --> 01:22:19,920
what the fuck are they doing?
Why do they want to go to mars?

1560
01:22:19,921 --> 01:22:22,530
It's the shittiest neighborhood ever on 
earth.

1561
01:22:22,710 --> 01:22:25,040
Imagine going to some unbelievably 
unhappy,

1562
01:22:25,220 --> 01:22:29,520
an unpopulated inhospitable environment 
on earth.

1563
01:22:29,550 --> 01:22:34,550
Would you go there?
Would you go to someplace where you're 

1564
01:22:34,550 --> 01:22:36,450
like sleeping on the edge of a volcano,
breathing cosmic gases through a fucking

1565
01:22:36,451 --> 01:22:39,420
giant mask because you can't breathe the
air.

1566
01:22:39,421 --> 01:22:42,660
You have to have this some air tanks and
you have all this gear.

1567
01:22:42,661 --> 01:22:43,770
Just keep you alive.
You'd be like,

1568
01:22:43,771 --> 01:22:46,320
fuck no.
why would I do that when I could live in

1569
01:22:46,321 --> 01:22:48,930
Hawaii?
Why would I do that when I can be in san

1570
01:22:48,931 --> 01:22:49,890
diEgo?
You wouldn't.

1571
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:52,650
Why would you go to fucking mars?

1572
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:57,830
Except that there are some people.
There are some crazy.

1573
01:22:57,831 --> 01:23:02,600
People really want to see this new shit.
The people that pay the $20,000,000

1574
01:23:02,620 --> 01:23:07,620
to build the space station,
there's gonna to be hitting 50 million 

1575
01:23:07,620 --> 01:23:11,341
at some point to go around the moon.
I mean if you talk to the people who 

1576
01:23:11,341 --> 01:23:12,210
went to the cost per person,
50 million.

1577
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:17,360
I heard it thrown around,
but only rich assholes are Going to Be 

1578
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:17,520
able to afford going around the moon 
then.

1579
01:23:18,010 --> 01:23:23,010
Well,
it's like in the days of great 

1580
01:23:23,010 --> 01:23:23,010
exploration.
I mean rich assholes funded darwin's.

1581
01:23:23,010 --> 01:23:27,780
Is it going to be like cell phones where
it starts off with rich assholes like 

1582
01:23:27,780 --> 01:23:28,090
Michael Douglas in wall street with the 
big brick.

1583
01:23:28,860 --> 01:23:31,750
Huge on that.
Eventually on the miracle mile show.

1584
01:23:31,780 --> 01:23:36,780
Yeah.
You go to third world countries and 

1585
01:23:36,780 --> 01:23:36,780
everybody has a cell phone.
It's going to be like that.

1586
01:23:36,780 --> 01:23:37,060
Is that true though?

1587
01:23:37,060 --> 01:23:42,060
Because it's very disturbing to me that 
people aren't more up in arms about the 

1588
01:23:42,060 --> 01:23:42,940
loss of the space shuttle and.
But the loss,

1589
01:23:43,270 --> 01:23:45,800
lack of funding.
That was crazy.

1590
01:23:45,830 --> 01:23:50,830
it's so crazy,
but it's so confusing because every 

1591
01:23:50,830 --> 01:23:51,250
movie from when I was a kid or even 
television shows.

1592
01:23:51,420 --> 01:23:54,880
You remember space 1999,
1999.

1593
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:58,750
We were living in space.
Nineteen 99.

1594
01:23:59,590 --> 01:24:01,740
What happened?
What was it?

1595
01:24:01,750 --> 01:24:04,870
Two thousand 14 and we don't have an 
have an active space program.

1596
01:24:05,170 --> 01:24:08,140
We don't.
And because there's fundamental problems

1597
01:24:08,141 --> 01:24:10,580
with the economics,
but even space x,

1598
01:24:10,581 --> 01:24:12,130
so space x,
what they dId.

1599
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:15,400
What elon did down in el segundo here,
he said,

1600
01:24:15,401 --> 01:24:20,401
okay,
well we're going to do is make a low 

1601
01:24:20,401 --> 01:24:22,641
cost launcher,
gonna up tHe same engines on the second 

1602
01:24:22,641 --> 01:24:25,171
stage as we have in the first eight,
not to fricking types of engines with 

1603
01:24:25,171 --> 01:24:27,100
lockheed martin and boeing launchers 
like they're so complicated.

1604
01:24:27,430 --> 01:24:28,950
Why?
because they're government contractors.

1605
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:30,520
They're going to have to bill a lot more
money.

1606
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,160
They're going to overbuild the 
government for being.

1607
01:24:33,190 --> 01:24:34,660
That's what it was.
Oh,

1608
01:24:34,661 --> 01:24:36,420
it's incredible.
So it stifled innovation.

1609
01:24:36,430 --> 01:24:37,990
The fact that we're getting money from 
the government.

1610
01:24:38,010 --> 01:24:39,820
Yeah,
because it's government contractors.

1611
01:24:40,060 --> 01:24:44,320
So what the government did in the 19 
twenties when aviation was just starting

1612
01:24:44,321 --> 01:24:49,321
out,
they gave these contracts with these 

1613
01:24:49,321 --> 01:24:50,950
little fabric error companies to run 
postal mail.

1614
01:24:50,980 --> 01:24:52,600
They invented air mail.
So they said,

1615
01:24:52,601 --> 01:24:57,601
well,
we'll create a new kind of male called 

1616
01:24:57,601 --> 01:25:00,331
air mail for the post office.
It doesn't go by horse and buggy or 

1617
01:25:00,331 --> 01:25:03,780
train or whatever,
and these little companies got enough 

1618
01:25:03,780 --> 01:25:07,500
finance from that that they started 
running air mail around and they became 

1619
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:11,461
continental airlines and united airlines
and all of them came out of that thing 

1620
01:25:12,190 --> 01:25:16,150
by moving it to private enterprise.
So it nasa did and it's great wisdom.

1621
01:25:16,150 --> 01:25:21,150
Sometimes it has great wisdom and 
created a program in the two thousands 

1622
01:25:21,150 --> 01:25:23,530
and the arts to do this.
So you've got space x now and you've got

1623
01:25:23,560 --> 01:25:26,380
orbital sciences at least,
but what?

1624
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:28,840
They're not inventing much in the way of
new tech.

1625
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:34,200
They're inventing a reliable low cost 
launch or just like the soviets head in 

1626
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:36,130
the sixties and still have proton,
you know,

1627
01:25:36,580 --> 01:25:41,580
low cost made an assembly line.
You look at the air and erica mush 

1628
01:25:41,580 --> 01:25:44,680
factory in Russia that makes the soviet 
boosters and,

1629
01:25:45,020 --> 01:25:47,280
and how they make this,
the soyuz craft.

1630
01:25:47,290 --> 01:25:49,870
It's like henry ford's assembly line,
low cost,

1631
01:25:49,871 --> 01:25:51,580
high reliability,
you know.

1632
01:25:51,581 --> 01:25:55,960
So we had lost that culture and now it's
coming back with space x.

1633
01:25:56,020 --> 01:25:57,820
But the economics are still really 
rotten.

1634
01:25:58,150 --> 01:26:01,450
So it's coming back because of private 
funding and the private sector,

1635
01:26:01,451 --> 01:26:06,451
private sector because of competition,
because of competition and innovation 

1636
01:26:06,451 --> 01:26:10,331
coming from silicon valley and other 
brains than people who work for large 

1637
01:26:10,331 --> 01:26:10,331
aerospace.

1638
01:26:10,331 --> 01:26:15,230
So it's kind of another example of 
bureaucracy and government sort of 

1639
01:26:15,230 --> 01:26:15,230
getting in thE way

1640
01:26:15,230 --> 01:26:15,960
progress.
Well,

1641
01:26:15,961 --> 01:26:18,930
in this case they got out of the way of 
progress and they said,

1642
01:26:18,931 --> 01:26:20,520
well,
we're losing the shuttle anyway.

1643
01:26:20,850 --> 01:26:25,850
We'll create this small program 
relatively small where we'll fund the 

1644
01:26:25,850 --> 01:26:27,390
winners of the competition.
So somebody.

1645
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:29,460
It was kind of like the x prize,
right?

1646
01:26:29,910 --> 01:26:34,910
This idea of challenges and prizes in 
the darpa prize and that's created a 

1647
01:26:34,910 --> 01:26:37,180
huge amount of innovation that's really 
worked.

1648
01:26:37,181 --> 01:26:39,870
That's been a government thing that 
worked because they said,

1649
01:26:39,910 --> 01:26:44,910
well,
a cure to new astronaut glove or self 

1650
01:26:44,910 --> 01:26:45,180
driving robot that can track the.

1651
01:26:45,290 --> 01:26:50,290
So the highway.
But so much military technology came out

1652
01:26:50,901 --> 01:26:55,901
of the apollo missions means so,
so much of from the space race between 

1653
01:26:55,970 --> 01:26:59,360
us versus the soviets.
So much innovation came out of it and so

1654
01:26:59,361 --> 01:27:03,250
much of it was was very valuable as far 
as military.

1655
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:06,500
why don't I just don't understand why 
that didn't continue.

1656
01:27:06,501 --> 01:27:08,390
It seems like that would be a no 
brainer,

1657
01:27:08,391 --> 01:27:13,391
like there will be a very important part
of what the military would want and who 

1658
01:27:13,391 --> 01:27:15,610
gets more money than the military.
The military against an ungodly sums

1659
01:27:15,750 --> 01:27:17,780
cash.
They're really,

1660
01:27:17,781 --> 01:27:19,850
really inefficient at delivering 
programs.

1661
01:27:20,120 --> 01:27:23,240
they have a high cancel rate and when 
they cancel a program,

1662
01:27:23,241 --> 01:27:25,040
it's $100,000,000,000
of loss,

1663
01:27:25,100 --> 01:27:30,100
but they seem like they've just stopped 
and what the military has done with the 

1664
01:27:30,100 --> 01:27:34,391
dod has done the same thing.
Nasa is doing the public sector chip 

1665
01:27:34,391 --> 01:27:39,161
manufacturers,
everything from laptops to whatever are 

1666
01:27:39,161 --> 01:27:41,960
so much more advanced than what the 
pentagon or nasa can make that they just

1667
01:27:41,961 --> 01:27:46,961
use off the shelf.
It's called cots commercial off the 

1668
01:27:46,961 --> 01:27:49,460
shelf and so they're not innovating.
They're just using laptops,

1669
01:27:49,461 --> 01:27:51,800
you know,
and they're using standard stuff they're

1670
01:27:51,801 --> 01:27:54,140
getting from industry because the 
industry is so far ahead.

1671
01:27:54,440 --> 01:27:57,020
Back in the fifties they were ahead in 
the sixties.

1672
01:27:57,080 --> 01:28:00,320
Now industries are so freaking far ahead
like tesla's batteries.

1673
01:28:00,321 --> 01:28:00,890
I mean,
who can.

1674
01:28:01,570 --> 01:28:03,860
Nobody's going to create something is 
superior.

1675
01:28:03,861 --> 01:28:05,780
Is that right?
Or not?

1676
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:07,500
Anytime in the near future.
Yeah,

1677
01:28:07,630 --> 01:28:09,460
there everyone's goes by those 
standards.

1678
01:28:10,170 --> 01:28:15,090
Do you think that there is a way that we
can kind of get back on track because of

1679
01:28:15,091 --> 01:28:20,091
the private sector being involved in 
space travel and we can really start 

1680
01:28:20,091 --> 01:28:22,791
saying man,
space travel to like we really can make 

1681
01:28:22,791 --> 01:28:27,721
up for that hiccup where we thought we 
would be with the shuttle down to the 

1682
01:28:27,740 --> 01:28:31,350
and then with only cost 50 million 
original movie alien.

1683
01:28:31,351 --> 01:28:33,760
What year was that Based in [inaudible]?
80 two.

1684
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:34,880
No,
79.

1685
01:28:34,890 --> 01:28:35,720
Yeah,
it was 79.

1686
01:28:35,730 --> 01:28:40,730
80 nine based on.
It was based on not that far in the 

1687
01:28:40,730 --> 01:28:42,870
future based on 2020 or something goofy 
like that.

1688
01:28:42,871 --> 01:28:43,700
But it wasn't a fee.

1689
01:28:43,940 --> 01:28:45,740
And you know,
blade runner,

1690
01:28:46,490 --> 01:28:51,490
2019.
Los angeles raining and sidebars and 

1691
01:28:51,490 --> 01:28:51,930
stuff.
yeah.

1692
01:28:52,010 --> 01:28:52,400
Yeah.
No,

1693
01:28:52,401 --> 01:28:52,560
we're.

1694
01:28:52,890 --> 01:28:57,890
Well isn't that still possible?
And then what we were talking about 

1695
01:28:57,890 --> 01:29:00,291
before about the creation of artificial 
life and the exponential growth of 

1696
01:29:00,291 --> 01:29:00,420
technology,
if you factor in those little things,

1697
01:29:00,630 --> 01:29:02,910
it might not 2019,
but it might be 2000,

1698
01:29:02,911 --> 01:29:04,050
29.
I mean,

1699
01:29:04,051 --> 01:29:09,051
they very well may have artificial life 
that's indistinguishable from you are on

1700
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:13,230
in another two or three decades.
So that's very possible,

1701
01:29:13,231 --> 01:29:13,500
right?

1702
01:29:13,770 --> 01:29:14,780
No,
no,

1703
01:29:14,810 --> 01:29:16,160
it's not.
It's really not.

1704
01:29:16,190 --> 01:29:21,190
I've spent at least 10 years trying to 
figure out why technology and biology 

1705
01:29:24,260 --> 01:29:29,260
are counter pose systems.
Why one doesn't do the other very well.

1706
01:29:30,350 --> 01:29:32,490
So for example,
um,

1707
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:37,010
I do a talk now and then at the 
singularity university,

1708
01:29:37,270 --> 01:29:38,540
I haven't been there for a couple of 
years,

1709
01:29:38,541 --> 01:29:43,541
but my talk is why the idea of a 
singularity is really not possible and I

1710
01:29:44,361 --> 01:29:48,170
can show up possible not possible with 
technology we have now.

1711
01:29:48,290 --> 01:29:49,460
Yeah.
But what does that mean?

1712
01:29:49,490 --> 01:29:51,260
I mean,
when you say not possible,

1713
01:29:51,261 --> 01:29:55,880
if things continue to go along the same 
exponential rate of progress,

1714
01:29:55,881 --> 01:29:57,920
right?
If it continues to go,

1715
01:29:58,210 --> 01:30:03,210
it's sort of,
I mean has to reach some sort of an end 

1716
01:30:03,210 --> 01:30:03,210
point,
right?

1717
01:30:03,210 --> 01:30:06,340
I mean it has to continue to innovate,
continue to grow as long as we have the 

1718
01:30:06,340 --> 01:30:06,340
physical materials.

1719
01:30:06,530 --> 01:30:11,530
Parents thought that parents read a lot 
of science articles and popular science 

1720
01:30:11,530 --> 01:30:14,840
journals and I remember sitting with him
in his house in Hawaii,

1721
01:30:15,170 --> 01:30:20,170
you know,
up half the night trying to to explain 

1722
01:30:20,170 --> 01:30:21,830
to parents why this idea was not 
feasible.

1723
01:30:21,930 --> 01:30:23,970
Why is that?
Well terrence,

1724
01:30:24,010 --> 01:30:29,010
yoU know,
you see we just done a whole virtual 

1725
01:30:29,010 --> 01:30:29,010
world thing.
I said,

1726
01:30:29,010 --> 01:30:30,140
terrence,
the virtual world that we just were in,

1727
01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:31,520
it's just,
it's a.

1728
01:30:31,790 --> 01:30:35,480
It's a a cardboard cutout.
There's nothing in it.

1729
01:30:35,780 --> 01:30:40,780
It's just polygons rendered in a scene 
by a serial processor that's getting 

1730
01:30:41,001 --> 01:30:44,300
bits from a server and it's all 
extremely fragile.

1731
01:30:44,301 --> 01:30:48,830
It looks realistic to us,
but it's a complete cardboard cutout and

1732
01:30:49,010 --> 01:30:54,010
on the other hand,
here's if you look down from terrence's 

1733
01:30:54,010 --> 01:30:56,801
house down,
a captain cook and you looked at the 

1734
01:30:56,801 --> 01:30:56,801
pacific ocean,
I said,

1735
01:30:56,801 --> 01:31:00,610
you take a glass full of water from that
ocean of what heck is going on in that 

1736
01:31:01,971 --> 01:31:05,030
class full of water and computational 
terms is just mind blowing.

1737
01:31:05,660 --> 01:31:10,660
It's a computational superpower and in 
fact that glass of water could not be 

1738
01:31:11,210 --> 01:31:16,210
simulated accurately by all the 
computers we've ever built all running 

1739
01:31:16,210 --> 01:31:16,370
at once.

1740
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:18,870
Not today,
but couldn't it be a thousand years now.

1741
01:31:18,871 --> 01:31:23,871
It's not possible to continue to stay 
alive and innovation continues to push 

1742
01:31:23,871 --> 01:31:26,740
the boundaries of whAt's possible as far
as computing mean.

1743
01:31:26,750 --> 01:31:30,510
you can only imagine what's capable.
We're capable of 100 years from now,

1744
01:31:30,850 --> 01:31:33,190
but the thing is we're building what 
we're building.

1745
01:31:33,580 --> 01:31:35,260
say for instance,
the steam engine,

1746
01:31:35,261 --> 01:31:39,460
right?
The steam engine was large bore diameter

1747
01:31:39,490 --> 01:31:40,300
pistons,
right?

1748
01:31:40,360 --> 01:31:45,360
Starting to 18 twenties and whatnot.
They got smaller and smaller and better 

1749
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:45,970
and better.
So we got motors,

1750
01:31:45,971 --> 01:31:48,550
we've got low commoditY and we got 
gasoline.

1751
01:31:49,030 --> 01:31:53,170
Right?
But the the piston and camshaft model is

1752
01:31:53,171 --> 01:31:55,360
still what drives your tesla?
Well,

1753
01:31:55,390 --> 01:31:56,950
maybe not because it doesn't that 
pistons,

1754
01:31:56,951 --> 01:31:59,370
and I know that's an electric motor,
so it for thing,

1755
01:31:59,420 --> 01:32:00,150
right?
Yeah.

1756
01:32:00,190 --> 01:32:02,320
It's a beautiful thing.
It got miniaturize,

1757
01:32:02,321 --> 01:32:06,430
it got better and better,
but it was stuck in a rigid framework of

1758
01:32:06,431 --> 01:32:11,431
what Its limitations work.
Computers are also stuck in that 

1759
01:32:11,431 --> 01:32:11,590
framework.
So for example,

1760
01:32:12,010 --> 01:32:15,160
john von neumann,
when he designed the von neumann machine

1761
01:32:15,161 --> 01:32:18,400
and at in princeton in 1948,
49,

1762
01:32:18,640 --> 01:32:21,940
and they built this first really 
reliable,

1763
01:32:21,941 --> 01:32:26,941
no patch cord,
lots of registers and memory and vacuum 

1764
01:32:26,981 --> 01:32:31,981
tubes and drums and shit.
They got all working by 1952 and then 

1765
01:32:31,981 --> 01:32:32,950
they gave the plans away.
Well,

1766
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:35,860
von neumann,
the creator of this wrote,

1767
01:32:36,280 --> 01:32:41,280
this is a contingency architecture.
This is just to get something to 

1768
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:44,290
actually work and not break down in 20 
minutes and do something,

1769
01:32:44,291 --> 01:32:49,291
but it is no way a strong architecture,
especially when it comes to dealing with

1770
01:32:49,511 --> 01:32:50,740
natural systems.

1771
01:32:51,280 --> 01:32:56,280
But.
But how haven't they overcome a lot of 

1772
01:32:56,280 --> 01:32:58,641
that,
at least in theory with quantum 

1773
01:32:58,641 --> 01:32:58,641
computing.

1774
01:32:58,641 --> 01:32:58,641
That's,
that's all I'm.

1775
01:32:58,641 --> 01:33:03,090
I'm not sold on that at all.
I think that those are extremely 

1776
01:33:03,090 --> 01:33:03,900
specialized,
very,

1777
01:33:03,901 --> 01:33:07,410
very small processes that we don't 
really even understand what's going on.

1778
01:33:07,570 --> 01:33:12,570
But doesn't It open up the potential.
And if you go back to the invention of 

1779
01:33:12,570 --> 01:33:13,120
the steam engine,
you compare it with a tesla and you look

1780
01:33:13,121 --> 01:33:18,121
at the x amount of hundreds of years,
put a plus of innovation that led to 

1781
01:33:18,121 --> 01:33:22,951
this incredible leap in technology.
When you just extrapolate and say like 

1782
01:33:22,951 --> 01:33:27,121
what we have today,
you can't possibly say that like flash 

1783
01:33:27,121 --> 01:33:28,270
drives and three gigabyte processes as 
the end all be all.

1784
01:33:28,450 --> 01:33:30,130
If we can't do it it with that,
we're never going to be.

1785
01:33:31,090 --> 01:33:36,090
Isn't it true that perhaps in the year 
2050 there will be a computer with a 

1786
01:33:37,001 --> 01:33:40,750
serial processor?
Maybe lots of like might have a thousand

1787
01:33:40,970 --> 01:33:43,780
cpas or more,
but it's still doing the same thing.

1788
01:33:43,781 --> 01:33:44,290
Why?
Because

1789
01:33:44,430 --> 01:33:46,750
tied to legacy,
it doesn't have to be.

1790
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:51,960
It has to be,
well why does it have to be doing the 

1791
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:54,411
same thing that it's doing now?
If quantum computing really does turn 

1792
01:33:54,411 --> 01:33:55,770
out to pan out,
he has a has to run microsoft word.

1793
01:33:55,850 --> 01:34:00,850
Why does it have to run microsoft word?
Because as the forces that are driving 

1794
01:34:00,850 --> 01:34:00,850
the evolution,
it's sort of.

1795
01:34:00,850 --> 01:34:05,480
But I mean like microsoft word today has
almost no relation to microsoft word of 

1796
01:34:05,480 --> 01:34:06,690
windows 95.
I mean,

1797
01:34:06,691 --> 01:34:09,890
it's barely connectable.
It's actually slower.

1798
01:34:10,820 --> 01:34:12,570
Well,
it does a lot more though,

1799
01:34:12,571 --> 01:34:13,720
right?
It does more.

1800
01:34:14,030 --> 01:34:15,910
I mean,
where

1801
01:34:16,150 --> 01:34:19,150
bloatware in.
I've got a 19,

1802
01:34:19,151 --> 01:34:23,560
91st three,
86 computer running windows.

1803
01:34:23,561 --> 01:34:24,240
three point one.

1804
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:30,000
Mcguire had one of those.
He kept that shit deep into the 

1805
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:30,980
nineties,
man that I had it in like 97,

1806
01:34:30,981 --> 01:34:32,120
98.
He kept at.

1807
01:34:32,180 --> 01:34:33,860
oh my god.
Windows three point one.

1808
01:34:34,220 --> 01:34:36,020
I booted this up the other day.
It comes up.

1809
01:34:36,060 --> 01:34:37,770
Bam.
It's so fast.

1810
01:34:37,790 --> 01:34:38,060
I'm running

1811
01:34:38,220 --> 01:34:39,030
word,
I'm running.

1812
01:34:39,270 --> 01:34:43,650
I'm doing email in aol like so quick and
then I go.

1813
01:34:43,710 --> 01:34:46,170
Then I go to my modern machines is 
10,000

1814
01:34:46,171 --> 01:34:46,500
times

1815
01:34:46,690 --> 01:34:47,440
powerful.
It's like,

1816
01:34:47,470 --> 01:34:51,310
oh my god.
Another processor glitch has happened in

1817
01:34:51,311 --> 01:34:56,311
the wheel.
Have of laconic processes happening in 

1818
01:34:56,311 --> 01:34:58,190
windows or painting slowly because this 
bloke layer

1819
01:34:58,190 --> 01:35:01,180
upon layer upon layer of crabs,
you really have that much of a heart.

1820
01:35:01,181 --> 01:35:02,180
What?
What do you run?

1821
01:35:03,200 --> 01:35:04,830
Windows or unix or what are you run 
through?

1822
01:35:04,870 --> 01:35:05,720
Ridiculous.
I mean,

1823
01:35:05,721 --> 01:35:08,380
I'm,
I'm running vms,

1824
01:35:08,660 --> 01:35:13,660
like I run machines run like windows on 
top of a mack plan for him and I have 

1825
01:35:15,201 --> 01:35:18,680
tweaked and I go into all these forums 
and it's like,

1826
01:35:18,920 --> 01:35:20,030
oh,
you know,

1827
01:35:20,060 --> 01:35:25,060
windows seven not on a vm has all these 
incredible problems with a search 

1828
01:35:25,060 --> 01:35:29,600
indexer with.
You got to stop this because it'll 

1829
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:29,720
totally choked the operating system.
You got to stop that.

1830
01:35:29,721 --> 01:35:31,190
You got to do this,
so you have to.

1831
01:35:31,191 --> 01:35:36,191
It's like an automobile in 1910.
We get to be a mechanic to keep it 

1832
01:35:36,191 --> 01:35:38,480
working efficiently.
The stuff is so bad,

1833
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:40,760
but you're running some really 
complicated stuff though.

1834
01:35:40,761 --> 01:35:43,400
If you're running virtual machines,
well I'm running.

1835
01:35:43,670 --> 01:35:45,320
You're essentially running a heart.

1836
01:35:45,330 --> 01:35:46,970
You,
you're running an operating system,

1837
01:35:47,120 --> 01:35:52,120
then you're running another operating 
system on your operating system that's 

1838
01:35:52,120 --> 01:35:54,650
operating simultaneously and that's a 
lot of rich source,

1839
01:35:54,680 --> 01:35:59,680
but it's using the same hardware.
But what it exposes is the incredibly 

1840
01:36:00,130 --> 01:36:04,070
how incredibly poor we are as a species.
That writing software that's good and it

1841
01:36:04,071 --> 01:36:08,210
stays stable.
So this is just super duper complex.

1842
01:36:08,211 --> 01:36:13,211
I mean,
I don't have a problem with things 

1843
01:36:13,211 --> 01:36:13,211
crashing.
I mean,

1844
01:36:13,211 --> 01:36:13,280
if you compare it to like with windows 
95,

1845
01:36:13,281 --> 01:36:16,820
used to be like windows 95,
you see the blue screen of death all the

1846
01:36:16,821 --> 01:36:21,821
time.
My favorite story is if we're halfway 

1847
01:36:21,821 --> 01:36:25,211
between earth and the stars unite,
we're halfway to alpha centauri and the 

1848
01:36:25,211 --> 01:36:28,490
3000 crew are and their deep sleep and 
suddenly they're all woken up.

1849
01:36:28,740 --> 01:36:31,310
They're getting out of their vessels and
they go and they,

1850
01:36:31,410 --> 01:36:36,410
they look at the screens on the bridge 
and they're all blue and it says press 

1851
01:36:36,410 --> 01:36:37,550
control,
alt delete.

1852
01:36:37,550 --> 01:36:42,550
You will lose all data.
And we realized we were running dos 

1853
01:36:42,550 --> 01:36:45,170
underneath all of this technology layer 
upon layer,

1854
01:36:45,171 --> 01:36:46,400
you know,
they'll be doomed.

1855
01:36:46,401 --> 01:36:48,290
You know,
I'm really confused about your,

1856
01:36:48,380 --> 01:36:50,120
your idea because you,
you,

1857
01:36:50,121 --> 01:36:55,121
you seem to think the things we're 
better off when they were lIke really 

1858
01:36:55,121 --> 01:36:58,061
clunky and they couldn't run as much 
software and the software wasn't as 

1859
01:36:58,061 --> 01:36:58,580
complex.
For example,

1860
01:36:58,581 --> 01:37:03,581
windows xp,
like when they discontinued support of 

1861
01:37:03,581 --> 01:37:04,010
xp.
Oh my god.

1862
01:37:04,050 --> 01:37:09,050
You found out there were millions and 
millions and accompanies that were just 

1863
01:37:09,050 --> 01:37:10,340
totally depend on it.
Saying this is so robust.

1864
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:14,700
This is so such good software and since 
xp,

1865
01:37:14,750 --> 01:37:19,750
that course they went to vista,
which was a disaster and the windows 

1866
01:37:19,750 --> 01:37:21,590
seven was sort of recovery and then 
windows eight was sort of a disaster and

1867
01:37:22,040 --> 01:37:25,850
now of course the evolution of mac ios 
is maybe a little different.

1868
01:37:25,870 --> 01:37:27,500
It's fantastic.
It's fantastic.

1869
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:30,320
The macro s is so much better than it 
ever was.

1870
01:37:30,430 --> 01:37:32,960
Back in the day.
The days,

1871
01:37:32,961 --> 01:37:37,961
the pre intel days,
the before rhapsody and before mark and 

1872
01:37:37,961 --> 01:37:37,961
unix.
Yeah,

1873
01:37:37,961 --> 01:37:39,800
it was.
It was just a kluge.

1874
01:37:40,310 --> 01:37:42,680
The macro s didn't have preemptive 
multitasking,

1875
01:37:42,920 --> 01:37:44,690
no memory protection,
no memory protection,

1876
01:37:44,691 --> 01:37:49,691
all that stuff.
I stayed away from max until the unix 

1877
01:37:49,691 --> 01:37:51,860
got onto the 10.
One 10 came along with him a lot.

1878
01:37:52,250 --> 01:37:56,040
But if you look at how can we be so bad 
and we're

1879
01:37:56,040 --> 01:38:00,640
spending the maximum amount of cash and 
only one or two companies and one or two

1880
01:38:00,890 --> 01:38:05,890
ever efforts make something that's good.
We're not really good at software 

1881
01:38:05,890 --> 01:38:05,940
actually.

1882
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:08,250
You're talking crazy.
This is your.

1883
01:38:08,320 --> 01:38:12,240
You're like extreme pessimistic attitude
towards innovation.

1884
01:38:12,241 --> 01:38:12,330
Yes.

1885
01:38:12,420 --> 01:38:15,260
Growing up in the software business and 
well,

1886
01:38:15,390 --> 01:38:20,390
you know,
seeing how things actually get done and 

1887
01:38:20,390 --> 01:38:23,871
then you meet a futurist or popularizer 
who comes up with this wild thing and 

1888
01:38:23,871 --> 01:38:26,790
you say,
no one's working on the project for one.

1889
01:38:27,150 --> 01:38:32,150
No,
there's no investment going into say 

1890
01:38:32,150 --> 01:38:32,150
putting consciousness and computers and 
does that.

1891
01:38:32,150 --> 01:38:33,450
I always ask the question,

1892
01:38:34,100 --> 01:38:39,100
putting consciousness into computers.
We're talking about a completely 

1893
01:38:39,100 --> 01:38:39,140
different thing now.
Talking about software develoPment first

1894
01:38:39,141 --> 01:38:41,690
and you cited will soft software 
writing,

1895
01:38:41,691 --> 01:38:46,691
creating.
You cited one excellent operating 

1896
01:38:46,691 --> 01:38:46,691
system.
Mac ios,

1897
01:38:46,691 --> 01:38:47,700
which exists right now.
I mean we are.

1898
01:38:47,701 --> 01:38:49,610
We are.
We need to say no one is writing it,

1899
01:38:49,611 --> 01:38:51,680
but it's there.
I'm on it right now.

1900
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:52,580
It's fantastic,

1901
01:38:52,680 --> 01:38:57,680
but it's doing stuff that has been done 
for 35 years in different operating 

1902
01:38:58,381 --> 01:38:58,620
systems,

1903
01:38:58,660 --> 01:39:03,660
different ways,
but that's one of the big things that 

1904
01:39:03,660 --> 01:39:04,030
happened when the transfer to osx came,
is that there was this big.

1905
01:39:04,090 --> 01:39:08,530
You had to get rid of all the old 
software because all the legacy software

1906
01:39:08,531 --> 01:39:13,531
was no longer useful.
He couldn't use it because it was 

1907
01:39:13,531 --> 01:39:13,531
running on a completely different 
platform.

1908
01:39:13,531 --> 01:39:14,800
So that right there sort of contradicts 
your idea,

1909
01:39:14,801 --> 01:39:15,130
doesn't it?

1910
01:39:15,440 --> 01:39:19,550
The thing is if you talk to somebody say
in 1990,

1911
01:39:19,970 --> 01:39:21,260
right?
Uh,

1912
01:39:21,470 --> 01:39:22,390
well,
uh,

1913
01:39:22,820 --> 01:39:27,820
you know,
where will software evolution be in 

1914
01:39:27,820 --> 01:39:29,681
2015?
They Probably would just like your 

1915
01:39:29,681 --> 01:39:29,720
disappoint with the space program,
right?

1916
01:39:30,290 --> 01:39:35,290
It's disappointing in the software 
business is the software business is 

1917
01:39:35,290 --> 01:39:37,610
grinding away.
This is what jaron lanier talks about.

1918
01:39:37,611 --> 01:39:42,611
He,
he wrote this thing caLled half a 

1919
01:39:42,611 --> 01:39:44,031
manifesto about 10 years ago,
which is like we are so burdened by 

1920
01:39:44,031 --> 01:39:46,940
legacy and for poor practices that we 
just add.

1921
01:39:47,060 --> 01:39:51,290
We're building like a tower of babel.
Sometimes works well sometimes doesn't,

1922
01:39:51,291 --> 01:39:53,780
but we add layer upon layer upon layer 
without thinking.

1923
01:39:53,990 --> 01:39:58,180
So we're not building great pyramids at 
giza were building some kind of tower of

1924
01:39:58,181 --> 01:40:01,130
babel of technology that's really 
patchwork together.

1925
01:40:01,320 --> 01:40:06,320
maybe you just know more about it than I
do because when I look at it objective 

1926
01:40:06,320 --> 01:40:06,480
as someone who's not involved in the 
industry,

1927
01:40:06,720 --> 01:40:10,980
all I'm seeing is continual innovation.
All I'm seeing is things getting better,

1928
01:40:10,981 --> 01:40:15,330
crisper move better,
boot up faster when he went last.

1929
01:40:15,340 --> 01:40:15,790
I agree

1930
01:40:15,790 --> 01:40:20,790
witH you on that.
When we went to say the ipad and mobile 

1931
01:40:20,790 --> 01:40:21,140
devices,
they could throw away all that legacy to

1932
01:40:21,141 --> 01:40:25,480
say throw it no more compact discs,
throw it in the trash,

1933
01:40:25,481 --> 01:40:30,481
no more file systems and layer and that 
will build a brand new operating system 

1934
01:40:30,700 --> 01:40:35,620
running on flash memory and get rid of 
the crap and we'll even have new ways to

1935
01:40:35,621 --> 01:40:37,090
do applications.
So when that happened,

1936
01:40:37,091 --> 01:40:39,130
it was like a hUge breath of fresh air.
I was like,

1937
01:40:39,730 --> 01:40:42,070
oh,
there isn't 500,000

1938
01:40:42,071 --> 01:40:45,550
features to my mail program.
It just does mail.

1939
01:40:45,551 --> 01:40:50,020
And we dumbed it down.
We made it super simple to get away from

1940
01:40:50,021 --> 01:40:53,890
our natural tendency to.
So the space station are going example,

1941
01:40:53,900 --> 01:40:56,320
like space stations.
So complicated,

1942
01:40:56,680 --> 01:40:59,290
right?
It has its 15 nations are 13 nations.

1943
01:40:59,291 --> 01:41:01,960
There's a hundred and 50 kinds of 
connectors on it,

1944
01:41:02,530 --> 01:41:07,530
right?
It is designed to be remotely run 

1945
01:41:07,530 --> 01:41:07,530
without any crew.

1946
01:41:07,530 --> 01:41:11,730
That was one of the initial design 
criteria that we should be able to 

1947
01:41:11,730 --> 01:41:11,830
completely remotely run in the space 
station.

1948
01:41:12,070 --> 01:41:17,070
So it has laptops and ancient computers 
and huge millions of lines of code to 

1949
01:41:18,071 --> 01:41:22,390
run the space station.
So it's a huge cost,

1950
01:41:22,420 --> 01:41:24,910
it's a huge burden to keep that thing 
running.

1951
01:41:25,180 --> 01:41:26,470
Go back to skylab,
you know,

1952
01:41:26,471 --> 01:41:30,010
you're old enough to probably remember 
skylab was a tin can,

1953
01:41:30,350 --> 01:41:35,350
does an upper stage of the saturn five,
the beautiful saturn five most reliable 

1954
01:41:35,350 --> 01:41:37,600
booster in history thrown away.
So one of the last ones,

1955
01:41:37,601 --> 01:41:40,290
they launched the upper stage as a tin 
cans,

1956
01:41:40,291 --> 01:41:44,200
space station,
solar panels up super simple,

1957
01:41:44,410 --> 01:41:47,290
huge interior space.
Guys could run around it,

1958
01:41:47,350 --> 01:41:50,140
remember how they could run and you 
know,

1959
01:41:50,380 --> 01:41:55,380
a beautiful model of a space station 
that didn't require more than a 30 

1960
01:41:55,380 --> 01:41:59,101
percent of crew time to sort of keep 
maintenance going on the international 

1961
01:41:59,101 --> 01:42:02,821
space station.
The crew or are overwhelmed with 

1962
01:42:02,821 --> 01:42:03,070
maintenance chores.
It's so complicated.

1963
01:42:03,071 --> 01:42:05,830
So we built something and I asked a 
friend at nasa,

1964
01:42:05,831 --> 01:42:10,831
I said,
what if you put boosters on the space 

1965
01:42:10,831 --> 01:42:12,841
station and senate,
tried to send it to mars to carry a 

1966
01:42:12,841 --> 01:42:15,841
crew,
said they'd be dead in a month because 

1967
01:42:15,841 --> 01:42:20,650
we're constantly having to send up parts
and repair shit that's breaking is not a

1968
01:42:20,651 --> 01:42:25,651
sustainable platform currently without a
huge amount of maintenance and resupply 

1969
01:42:25,781 --> 01:42:27,010
and constant management.

1970
01:42:27,330 --> 01:42:29,390
Right.
But I'm like an operating system.

1971
01:42:29,470 --> 01:42:31,200
Your,
your pessimism though,

1972
01:42:31,590 --> 01:42:35,280
because it seems to me that if you 
really want to like nitpick and focus on

1973
01:42:35,281 --> 01:42:40,281
this blip in time is one blip in time 
where they may be peaks and valleys in 

1974
01:42:40,281 --> 01:42:44,811
innovation.
Ultimately it seems to be sort of 

1975
01:42:44,811 --> 01:42:48,990
inexorably moving towards progress or 
moving towards complexity.

1976
01:42:49,020 --> 01:42:50,190
Right?
When did you agree with that?

1977
01:42:50,290 --> 01:42:55,290
But the progress say toward having 
something as good as biology.

1978
01:42:57,760 --> 01:43:02,760
How biology operates.
Operating and technology is a big 

1979
01:43:02,760 --> 01:43:04,150
challenge.
Technology is this,

1980
01:43:04,330 --> 01:43:08,890
I mean the biology of the cell and how a
cell metabolizes products,

1981
01:43:08,891 --> 01:43:11,560
how it manages its energy,
it has its feedback.

1982
01:43:11,561 --> 01:43:14,950
You know,
a cell is like a huge cityscape working.

1983
01:43:15,280 --> 01:43:16,830
It works.
90 nine point nine,

1984
01:43:16,831 --> 01:43:17,980
nine,
nine percent of the time,

1985
01:43:17,990 --> 01:43:20,440
otherwise you'd be just mush flowing on 
the ground,

1986
01:43:20,610 --> 01:43:21,100
but,
but isn't,

1987
01:43:21,250 --> 01:43:26,250
are we talking about biological 
processes like processing proteins and 

1988
01:43:26,250 --> 01:43:26,650
things along those lines and yeah,
exactly.

1989
01:43:26,651 --> 01:43:31,651
That won't necessarily be necessary if 
you have something artificial silicon 

1990
01:43:31,651 --> 01:43:35,971
based,
something that's running on electricity 

1991
01:43:35,971 --> 01:43:35,971
and technology and lithium ion batteries
here,

1992
01:43:35,971 --> 01:43:36,340
problem.

1993
01:43:36,580 --> 01:43:39,580
it's based on two week of a model of 
physics.

1994
01:43:40,500 --> 01:43:42,200
So here's,
here's the,

1995
01:43:42,210 --> 01:43:47,210
here's the metaphor that I use and this 
is why computer people hate this idea 

1996
01:43:48,010 --> 01:43:49,360
life.
What idea?

1997
01:43:49,420 --> 01:43:53,450
The idea that life based on 
probabilistic events.

1998
01:43:54,020 --> 01:43:56,480
So here's,
here's how you digest sugar.

1999
01:43:56,481 --> 01:44:00,110
Say you take a nice big bolus of sugar 
into your body.

2000
01:44:00,820 --> 01:44:02,060
Um,
you know,

2001
01:44:02,061 --> 01:44:07,061
the,
the sugar molecule will come into 

2002
01:44:07,061 --> 01:44:09,131
yourself at some point somewhere.
It will hit this molecular storm of shit

2003
01:44:10,371 --> 01:44:12,200
going on.
Mostly water molecule.

2004
01:44:12,470 --> 01:44:17,470
It will ricochet around the cell hitting
just about every other molecule that it 

2005
01:44:18,141 --> 01:44:20,440
can in the cell for a second,
second,

2006
01:44:20,450 --> 01:44:25,450
half to seconds until it hits.
It hits exactly the right place on a 

2007
01:44:25,450 --> 01:44:28,610
molecule that has a pocket of the sugar 
fits in perfectly.

2008
01:44:28,910 --> 01:44:32,270
And that thing will cause it to band and
go click,

2009
01:44:32,271 --> 01:44:36,470
click and make it into a polysaccharide,
which is an important valuable thing,

2010
01:44:37,040 --> 01:44:42,040
but it's all done through this.
What is going on as a probabilistic 

2011
01:44:42,040 --> 01:44:43,070
stochastic process.
It's completely nuts,

2012
01:44:43,490 --> 01:44:48,490
but that's how nature is.
And so when you compare that process to 

2013
01:44:48,681 --> 01:44:51,320
the way a computer would work,
so a computer designer would say,

2014
01:44:51,350 --> 01:44:56,350
well that's dumb.
That's a whole lot of wasted steps and 

2015
01:44:56,350 --> 01:44:58,640
computation.
I'll just build a assembly line.

2016
01:44:58,641 --> 01:45:01,790
we'll take that sugar in and along the 
similar line and we'll hit my thing out.

2017
01:45:01,820 --> 01:45:03,290
Digested immediately.
Well,

2018
01:45:03,291 --> 01:45:08,291
it turns out if you do things like that,
they're so rigid that they break almost 

2019
01:45:08,291 --> 01:45:10,760
immediately and in real world and 
nature.

2020
01:45:10,820 --> 01:45:15,530
But this isn't this if you're imitating 
biological synthesis or biological life.

2021
01:45:15,531 --> 01:45:17,990
And why would you do that?
If you're creating something artificial,

2022
01:45:18,230 --> 01:45:23,230
all you need to do to create an 
artificial person as have it behave.

2023
01:45:23,510 --> 01:45:27,350
Think compute,
react like a person.

2024
01:45:27,380 --> 01:45:30,530
It doesn't need to process proteins.
I mean these are all.

2025
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:33,710
that's legacy.
Isn't that like being tied to legacy?

2026
01:45:33,711 --> 01:45:36,260
What do you throw away from what a 
person is?

2027
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:41,320
How do you define,
say consciousness or I don't think you 

2028
01:45:41,320 --> 01:45:41,900
would call it a person at all.
Why would you call it a person?

2029
01:45:42,130 --> 01:45:44,090
I mean,
we're not throwing it away.

2030
01:45:44,270 --> 01:45:48,990
What I'm talking about is creating 
something completely unique and wouldn't

2031
01:45:49,010 --> 01:45:53,210
have to be a duplicate of a person I 
would have to do is look like one.

2032
01:45:53,540 --> 01:45:58,540
Right?
But then we're building cardboard 

2033
01:45:58,540 --> 01:45:58,540
simulacra again,
that really aren't the real thing.

2034
01:45:58,730 --> 01:46:01,250
If you sent that person or the New York 
subway system,

2035
01:46:01,310 --> 01:46:06,310
that robot robotic entity,
it will be soon overwhelmed with 

2036
01:46:06,310 --> 01:46:07,010
stimulus and programs

2037
01:46:07,290 --> 01:46:09,690
unless she conditions before it,
unless you,

2038
01:46:09,960 --> 01:46:12,990
unless you built human being one point.
Oh,

2039
01:46:13,200 --> 01:46:18,200
and you found the flaws and then built 
two point zero and found the flaws and 

2040
01:46:18,200 --> 01:46:21,621
keep going the same way we've described 
already with operating systems from 

2041
01:46:21,621 --> 01:46:24,591
1995.
A mere blip in time to 2014 and the 

2042
01:46:24,591 --> 01:46:25,950
massive amount of progress has been made
since then.

2043
01:46:26,130 --> 01:46:28,960
If you did that with computer generated 
or,

2044
01:46:29,010 --> 01:46:29,380
or,
or,

2045
01:46:29,381 --> 01:46:30,630
uh,
electronically generated,

2046
01:46:30,631 --> 01:46:33,060
whatever you want to call artificial 
life forms that we've created.

2047
01:46:33,360 --> 01:46:38,360
I mean,
it just stands to reason given enough 

2048
01:46:38,360 --> 01:46:38,360
time.
No asteroids,

2049
01:46:38,360 --> 01:46:38,930
supervolcanoes,
no ebola,

2050
01:46:38,960 --> 01:46:40,830
right?
Humans are going to get there.

2051
01:46:41,710 --> 01:46:44,560
I think it's a harder problem than we 
can suppose.

2052
01:46:44,710 --> 01:46:49,710
Like nancy,
it's really hard because we don't 

2053
01:46:49,710 --> 01:46:51,960
understand how basic really functions 
when we don't understand,

2054
01:46:51,961 --> 01:46:53,060
for example,
well,

2055
01:46:53,070 --> 01:46:55,710
here's another example,
the neuron,

2056
01:46:55,970 --> 01:46:57,090
you know,
with 10,000

2057
01:46:57,091 --> 01:47:02,091
connections and the body and the sodium 
channel and there's all these things 

2058
01:47:02,091 --> 01:47:06,090
that come out and you know,
the neurotransmitters are generated into

2059
01:47:06,091 --> 01:47:08,190
this pole and they carry the signal and 
everything.

2060
01:47:08,640 --> 01:47:13,640
The neuron Is so frickin big.
I do something called molecular dynamics

2061
01:47:14,311 --> 01:47:19,311
simulation.
Our team has done that where you just 

2062
01:47:19,311 --> 01:47:19,740
simulating a molecules wiggling 
movement,

2063
01:47:20,250 --> 01:47:25,250
right?
and they're doing this now for protein 

2064
01:47:25,250 --> 01:47:28,110
folding where they get 10,000
atoms all arranged in the right place in

2065
01:47:28,111 --> 01:47:31,620
the simulation and the computer so that 
it behaves like a real protein would do,

2066
01:47:32,160 --> 01:47:34,470
which is fold and do all this weird 
geometry.

2067
01:47:34,530 --> 01:47:37,920
So they have to simulate the protein 
being slammed by water all the time.

2068
01:47:37,921 --> 01:47:42,921
It's this crazy process.
It might take those guys a month of 

2069
01:47:42,921 --> 01:47:44,640
computation on a computer.
A 10,000

2070
01:47:44,641 --> 01:47:49,641
processors to simulate a couple of 
nanoseconds of that action because 

2071
01:47:49,890 --> 01:47:54,890
otherwise the simulated protein just 
doesn't behave like it really does in 

2072
01:47:54,890 --> 01:47:56,040
nature.
It's that hard.

2073
01:47:56,150 --> 01:48:01,150
Right?
So I think we're in agreement that 

2074
01:48:01,150 --> 01:48:03,790
replicating absolute biological 
processes would be insanely difficult.

2075
01:48:03,851 --> 01:48:07,850
Saying may take forever,
but my question is why is that necessary

2076
01:48:07,851 --> 01:48:10,340
to create something new that can think 
for itself?

2077
01:48:10,640 --> 01:48:14,390
Because here's the problem.
If you created something very small,

2078
01:48:14,420 --> 01:48:19,420
for example,
not a human walking around the New York 

2079
01:48:19,420 --> 01:48:19,420
subway system,
it's something we're.

2080
01:48:19,420 --> 01:48:20,840
What world does it live in?
You know,

2081
01:48:21,070 --> 01:48:23,270
he lives in a.
If it's a robot,

2082
01:48:23,271 --> 01:48:27,200
say it's a little insectoid robot.
What world does it have to live in?

2083
01:48:28,470 --> 01:48:29,930
Just living in this world?
What do you mean?

2084
01:48:30,230 --> 01:48:31,190
Well,
if it lives,

2085
01:48:31,250 --> 01:48:33,530
say on a factory floor,
a good example,

2086
01:48:33,710 --> 01:48:36,020
factory floor robots are really getting 
good.

2087
01:48:36,290 --> 01:48:41,290
Like they can carry shit around,
they can track spots on the floor and 

2088
01:48:41,290 --> 01:48:44,330
they can do all kinds of shit,
but if they ever go out in the parking,

2089
01:48:44,331 --> 01:48:47,510
if you put them out in the parking lot,
you know where they're out of.

2090
01:48:47,511 --> 01:48:52,511
They're very controlled theory in a 
virtual world when they're in a factor 

2091
01:48:52,511 --> 01:48:55,301
in there,
they see tape and marks and fire codes 

2092
01:48:55,301 --> 01:48:58,130
and all kinds of things that create the 
mental model inside the robot,

2093
01:48:58,640 --> 01:49:03,640
but if it goes into nature and the chaos
of the natural world and vehicles moving

2094
01:49:04,221 --> 01:49:06,310
around and stuff like that,
you know,

2095
01:49:06,380 --> 01:49:11,380
the darpa grand challenge,
which has all these great teams making 

2096
01:49:11,380 --> 01:49:11,380
robots are self driving.

2097
01:49:11,380 --> 01:49:13,870
They found out reAl fast that we're,
you know,

2098
01:49:13,880 --> 01:49:16,040
this is hard,
super hard

2099
01:49:16,070 --> 01:49:17,150
currently hard but,
but,

2100
01:49:17,180 --> 01:49:22,180
but isn't the new tesla d you could 
phone home with this thing and it will 

2101
01:49:22,180 --> 01:49:22,550
literally drive to you.

2102
01:49:22,900 --> 01:49:25,840
And I heard a rumor by the way,
and this is maybe a,

2103
01:49:25,960 --> 01:49:30,960
a google car in a self driving google 
car that on the eight 80 there was a,

2104
01:49:33,730 --> 01:49:38,730
a google self driving car scene that had
an irish setter sitting.

2105
01:49:39,250 --> 01:49:41,130
You're done and we'll hear a dog on her,
right?

2106
01:49:41,770 --> 01:49:44,380
It was sitting in the passenger seat.
There was no one else in it.

2107
01:49:45,220 --> 01:49:48,890
And the cops were told about this.
People are calling this,

2108
01:49:48,891 --> 01:49:49,750
this,
this car.

2109
01:49:49,751 --> 01:49:54,751
There's this irish setter is driving 
this car and the cops come up and 

2110
01:49:54,751 --> 01:49:58,861
there's an irish setter sitting in the 
seat and there's no one else and they 

2111
01:49:58,861 --> 01:50:02,170
follow it and it goes to a 
veterinarian's office and the door opens

2112
01:50:02,200 --> 01:50:07,200
and the dog laid it,
goes into the veterinarian office and 

2113
01:50:07,200 --> 01:50:09,910
this is the rumor that I heard was 
somebody just didn't have time.

2114
01:50:10,240 --> 01:50:15,240
They put the car,
the dog in the car and they send it to 

2115
01:50:15,240 --> 01:50:15,240
the vet's office,
you Know,

2116
01:50:15,240 --> 01:50:17,500
which is totally in violation of any 
kind of.

2117
01:50:20,230 --> 01:50:25,230
Doesn't that story Itself disprove this 
notion that it's too difficult to do 

2118
01:50:25,230 --> 01:50:29,581
something like this when you're dealing 
with the real world and all the 

2119
01:50:29,581 --> 01:50:32,611
variables and all the moving parts and 
you just talked about a driving the 

2120
01:50:32,611 --> 01:50:32,920
fucking car.
I meAn that's kind of It right now.

2121
01:50:32,921 --> 01:50:36,370
And this is only 2014,
but you know,

2122
01:50:36,730 --> 01:50:41,730
in footprint tall in Germany,
in the 19th century they were doing a 

2123
01:50:41,890 --> 01:50:46,890
remote control trains.
They were doing trains that would go 

2124
01:50:46,890 --> 01:50:49,570
onto the track track to an electrical 
signal.

2125
01:50:49,840 --> 01:50:51,550
Stop,
pick people up.

2126
01:50:51,790 --> 01:50:55,030
I mean this stuff is actually pretty 
easy.

2127
01:50:55,160 --> 01:50:57,040
okay.
And but that's not,

2128
01:50:57,070 --> 01:50:59,200
we're talking about a road though.
It's not a track,

2129
01:50:59,201 --> 01:51:04,201
but there the difference between that 
and a living system is those are fixed 

2130
01:51:04,241 --> 01:51:09,241
function algorithms that are doing edge 
tracing on the edge of a highway saying 

2131
01:51:09,241 --> 01:51:11,020
where's the right line and where's the 
yellow line?

2132
01:51:11,560 --> 01:51:14,260
And they're getting a gps signal and if 
you look at the code,

2133
01:51:14,261 --> 01:51:15,840
it's not very big.
You know,

2134
01:51:15,841 --> 01:51:18,310
if it was a very big and complicated,
it probably wouldn't work.

2135
01:51:18,610 --> 01:51:23,610
So these google engineers have made 
something pretty elegant that has fuzzy 

2136
01:51:23,610 --> 01:51:24,520
logic and everything.
They've got it to work.

2137
01:51:24,880 --> 01:51:29,880
This has been tried since the 19 
thirties with the radio control cars 

2138
01:51:29,880 --> 01:51:33,630
that had radios on the front and back 
control of distance and they've got it 

2139
01:51:34,091 --> 01:51:39,091
to work.
But is this anything close to what life 

2140
01:51:39,091 --> 01:51:40,360
can do?
The adaptability,

2141
01:51:40,361 --> 01:51:40,920
but like,
no,

2142
01:51:41,050 --> 01:51:46,050
but,
but neither was the initial combustion 

2143
01:51:46,050 --> 01:51:49,741
engine even close to what the saturn 
five rocket was like neither was the 

2144
01:51:49,741 --> 01:51:52,600
original model t in comparison to a 
tesla.

2145
01:51:52,601 --> 01:51:55,840
And I mean doesn't that just stands to 
reason that constant innovation?

2146
01:51:55,870 --> 01:52:00,870
I agree with you except that when I see 
really saifai things come in that are 

2147
01:52:00,870 --> 01:52:05,701
just because I'm an engineer,
fundamentally when I see stuff that's 

2148
01:52:05,701 --> 01:52:05,701
like,
oh my God,

2149
01:52:05,701 --> 01:52:10,171
I can't even imagine how to get there 
because they're not even defining were 

2150
01:52:10,750 --> 01:52:11,890
what their term,
right?

2151
01:52:12,100 --> 01:52:15,220
They're not defining their terms and no 
one's working on the project.

2152
01:52:15,580 --> 01:52:19,090
So I'll give you one example of how hard
this stuff is.

2153
01:52:19,420 --> 01:52:24,420
So terrence and I would have these 
conversations about what he called 

2154
01:52:24,420 --> 01:52:27,750
novelty.
You remember he used to say can 

2155
01:52:27,750 --> 01:52:29,260
crescents into novelty.
So you know,

2156
01:52:29,290 --> 01:52:33,250
terence left us in the year 2000.
I saw the millennium.

2157
01:52:33,310 --> 01:52:38,310
If you define it as the year 2000,
but people say it really started in 

2158
01:52:38,310 --> 01:52:38,840
2001.
But I'm.

2159
01:52:39,490 --> 01:52:44,490
Terrence was talking about all this 
stuff and I would say that's pretty 

2160
01:52:44,490 --> 01:52:46,040
obvious to myself.
If things get novel,

2161
01:52:46,250 --> 01:52:50,510
how do they get novel?
And for years and years I worked on this

2162
01:52:50,511 --> 01:52:55,511
project called the evolution grid.
What we did was try to say let's 

2163
01:52:55,511 --> 01:52:59,291
simulate actual chemistry inside the 
computer and see if we can see novelty 

2164
01:52:59,420 --> 01:53:03,590
accreting and how does it do it.
And in 2011,

2165
01:53:03,591 --> 01:53:08,591
after running a year of simulations,
partly at uc san diego and up in my 

2166
01:53:08,591 --> 01:53:11,510
barn,
we believe that the whole surf all wired

2167
01:53:11,511 --> 01:53:16,511
together,
we found this staircasing formula that 

2168
01:53:16,511 --> 01:53:21,071
was a way that nature form structures in
this case bonds form between these 

2169
01:53:21,801 --> 01:53:24,080
virtual molecules and doesn't break 
them.

2170
01:53:24,710 --> 01:53:28,940
They don't just all go back to mush.
And it was this staircasing thing.

2171
01:53:29,360 --> 01:53:30,290
I said,
oh my god,

2172
01:53:30,291 --> 01:53:32,300
you know,
this took eight months of computation of

2173
01:53:32,301 --> 01:53:37,301
find this method by which perhaps the 
universe accretes novelty and holds onto

2174
01:53:38,241 --> 01:53:40,670
it.
So I sort of did a virtual call,

2175
01:53:40,671 --> 01:53:42,890
the parents and I said,
we found the formula,

2176
01:53:42,891 --> 01:53:47,891
I call it the cosmic wiggle,
and he calls this stuff like the cosmic 

2177
01:53:47,891 --> 01:53:49,750
giggle.
And if you remember from some talks,

2178
01:53:49,760 --> 01:53:51,770
I said,
we found the cosmic wiggle.

2179
01:53:52,310 --> 01:53:56,630
But in the process of doing that,
what I learned was holy shit,

2180
01:53:57,200 --> 01:53:59,840
the basis for life,
which is this massive,

2181
01:54:00,110 --> 01:54:05,110
huge engine of stochastic probabilistic 
storm that's going on that literally 

2182
01:54:06,890 --> 01:54:11,890
ratchets and rocks.
Everything from jujitsu matches to the 

2183
01:54:11,890 --> 01:54:11,890
jet.
Air.

2184
01:54:11,890 --> 01:54:16,420
Airplane is a powerful system.
It's not at the basis of computing 

2185
01:54:16,650 --> 01:54:21,650
computing is this delicate little thing 
will take a number and we'll do a thing 

2186
01:54:21,650 --> 01:54:25,550
with it and we'll spread it out here,
but nature's this massive machine.

2187
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:29,540
So perhaps the future,
and this is where we would come together

2188
01:54:29,780 --> 01:54:32,960
is a merger between computing and 
natural systems.

2189
01:54:33,200 --> 01:54:38,200
So this is a project that I'm calling 
the genesis engine project and it's 

2190
01:54:38,840 --> 01:54:43,840
having a computer control,
trillions of chemical experiments all 

2191
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:46,550
going at once and looking at them and 
selecting them and saying these are more

2192
01:54:46,551 --> 01:54:50,300
powerful experiments and it can just 
search through molecular space.

2193
01:54:50,720 --> 01:54:53,270
I just talked to a guy from google about
this and he was like,

2194
01:54:53,300 --> 01:54:55,040
oh,
molecular search.

2195
01:54:55,041 --> 01:55:00,041
We're interested in that.
We're not just limited our searches to 

2196
01:55:00,041 --> 01:55:02,030
you know,
the best bread recipes.

2197
01:55:02,300 --> 01:55:07,300
No,
we would like to search and molecule 

2198
01:55:07,300 --> 01:55:10,091
space and I talked to our neighbor and 
we have a place in New Jersey and he's 

2199
01:55:10,091 --> 01:55:14,771
like a head researcher at glaxo and he 
said this is incredibly valuable if you 

2200
01:55:14,771 --> 01:55:19,481
can,
if you can actually use molecules to do 

2201
01:55:19,481 --> 01:55:22,781
the walking.
run a trillion experiments at once and 

2202
01:55:22,781 --> 01:55:25,841
pick the best ones.
And then run the trillion more 

2203
01:55:25,841 --> 01:55:25,841
experiments and walked through chemical 
space.

2204
01:55:25,841 --> 01:55:30,430
We can figure out how to make a 
pharmaceutical in the least amount of 

2205
01:55:30,430 --> 01:55:34,541
steps you can simulate you create new 
materials and we'll have a hybrid 

2206
01:55:36,230 --> 01:55:40,760
digital and natural analog computer for 
the first time in this 21st century.

2207
01:55:40,780 --> 01:55:43,010
But now you're really confusing me 
because now you've,

2208
01:55:43,070 --> 01:55:44,070
you seem to think

2209
01:55:44,070 --> 01:55:48,060
that innovation is going to reach some 
new plateau if we do that.

2210
01:55:48,300 --> 01:55:53,300
If we're able to hybridize,
I think we're going to make the leaps 

2211
01:55:53,300 --> 01:55:53,670
that you are talking about.
Joe,

2212
01:55:54,090 --> 01:55:57,450
if we can do this hybrid,
if we can harness pessimism line,

2213
01:55:57,480 --> 01:55:58,320
what do you,
what do you,

2214
01:55:58,321 --> 01:56:03,321
uh,
I'm an engineer so I know what it takes 

2215
01:56:03,321 --> 01:56:06,111
to build these things.
And so I don't want to really oversell 

2216
01:56:06,111 --> 01:56:10,940
that by a certain date.
We're going to have a singularity of 

2217
01:56:10,940 --> 01:56:11,910
some sort that certain dates.
Stuff is always a goof it.

2218
01:56:12,150 --> 01:56:17,150
Ray kurzweil wants to do it now with 20,
45 and the 20 slash 25 slash 45.

2219
01:56:18,040 --> 01:56:20,280
They're being silly by doing that.
And I think it's,

2220
01:56:20,290 --> 01:56:20,620
it's,
it,

2221
01:56:20,940 --> 01:56:25,940
it does the whole idea of an exponential
increase in technology.

2222
01:56:26,061 --> 01:56:30,000
It does that whole idea disservice by 
like pretending than anybody.

2223
01:56:30,140 --> 01:56:35,140
First of all,
nobody's ever fucking predicted 

2224
01:56:35,140 --> 01:56:35,140
anything.

2225
01:56:35,140 --> 01:56:35,140
Right?
Right.

2226
01:56:35,140 --> 01:56:35,140
Nobody's ever nailed it.
I mean,

2227
01:56:35,140 --> 01:56:38,790
there's been some fascinating hg wells 
predictions that sorta came true,

2228
01:56:38,820 --> 01:56:42,570
but no one said like on November 19th,
1972,

2229
01:56:42,760 --> 01:56:44,670
there's going to be a telephone that 
does this.

2230
01:56:44,930 --> 01:56:49,930
And instead what happened like that?
December 21st 2012 drove me fucking 

2231
01:56:50,101 --> 01:56:55,101
crazy.
It drove me fucking crazy because first 

2232
01:56:55,101 --> 01:56:57,711
of all it was intoxicating and then it 
was maddening and then it became 

2233
01:56:57,711 --> 01:56:58,780
ridiculous.
And as the day rolled around it,

2234
01:56:58,900 --> 01:57:01,500
I did an end of the world show you 
december 20,

2235
01:57:01,501 --> 01:57:06,501
first 2012.
But doug stan hope and joey diaz and my 

2236
01:57:06,501 --> 01:57:06,501
friends,
honey,

2237
01:57:06,501 --> 01:57:06,630
honey,
this band.

2238
01:57:06,631 --> 01:57:08,850
And we did the show.
We did it live at the wiltern.

2239
01:57:08,851 --> 01:57:11,310
It's not,
it doesn't exist anywhere.

2240
01:57:11,700 --> 01:57:14,340
It was just a,
just a live show comedy show.

2241
01:57:14,400 --> 01:57:19,400
Yeah.
We just thought the asteroid was going 

2242
01:57:19,400 --> 01:57:21,091
to hit her.
The mayans were to come back or the 

2243
01:57:21,091 --> 01:57:21,091
aliens are going to land or whatever the
fuck was going to happen.

2244
01:57:21,091 --> 01:57:21,091
Nothing happened.
Of course,

2245
01:57:22,500 --> 01:57:27,500
down underneath grand central station in
New York city with a friend of mine 

2246
01:57:27,500 --> 01:57:30,711
who's a.
He's a kind of a psychedelic comic and 

2247
01:57:30,711 --> 01:57:30,711
he does.
What's his name?

2248
01:57:31,200 --> 01:57:36,200
What's his name again?
What kind of a friend is this brain is 

2249
01:57:36,200 --> 01:57:37,110
fried.
He's a wonderful guy,

2250
01:57:37,890 --> 01:57:42,890
but we just.
We laughed and then no one's gonna find 

2251
01:57:42,890 --> 01:57:42,890
them.
7 billion people in the building.

2252
01:57:42,890 --> 01:57:47,400
People.
we laughed our way through the day like 

2253
01:57:47,400 --> 01:57:50,841
you guys are doing it,
the wheelchair and tell jokes and we 

2254
01:57:50,841 --> 01:57:53,280
said we gotta get less serious.
This idea of picking a day so goofy.

2255
01:57:53,281 --> 01:57:56,610
Like I had daniel pinchbeck on the 
podcast once and he was saying that it's

2256
01:57:56,611 --> 01:57:59,080
definitely going to change the world to 
san diego.

2257
01:57:59,100 --> 01:58:00,660
Do you know that?
December 20,

2258
01:58:00,661 --> 01:58:02,830
first 2012.
Something's definitely not easy.

2259
01:58:02,860 --> 01:58:07,860
It's absolutely,
definitely gonna change where I was 

2260
01:58:07,860 --> 01:58:07,860
like,
what are you talking about now?

2261
01:58:07,860 --> 01:58:08,640
What are you fucking.
How can you say that?

2262
01:58:08,641 --> 01:58:11,040
You can't say that.
You can never say that.

2263
01:58:11,041 --> 01:58:13,310
You can never say that date,
but here's the show.

2264
01:58:13,311 --> 01:58:18,311
Here's a real cool and for you,
I have some of the last terence mckenna 

2265
01:58:18,311 --> 01:58:18,440
papers,
you know,

2266
01:58:18,580 --> 01:58:22,440
is archivist fire in 2007.
What happened there?

2267
01:58:22,470 --> 01:58:27,470
That was his lips in a rain forest.
How the fuck did a fire destroyed after 

2268
01:58:28,411 --> 01:58:30,840
he died?
The papers went to excellent.

2269
01:58:30,870 --> 01:58:35,870
Were you just were on the big sur coast 
and they stored them in town office in 

2270
01:58:35,870 --> 01:58:38,760
berlin and a quiznos shop.
Sub shop.

2271
01:58:38,761 --> 01:58:41,590
I kid you not at some kind of electrical
issue.

2272
01:58:41,890 --> 01:58:42,270
Burned

2273
01:58:42,270 --> 01:58:46,110
a whole city block down and the eslan 
office and terrence papers

2274
01:58:46,840 --> 01:58:47,860
go,
but didn't,

2275
01:58:48,100 --> 01:58:50,140
didn't his place in Hawaii burn too?

2276
01:58:50,260 --> 01:58:50,650
No.
No.

2277
01:58:50,651 --> 01:58:51,630
It's still there.
Oh,

2278
01:58:52,480 --> 01:58:54,040
who owns that?
You know,

2279
01:58:54,041 --> 01:58:55,840
I don't know.
I think it was sold recently.

2280
01:58:55,841 --> 01:58:57,700
Jesus christ who bought that fucking 
thing.

2281
01:58:57,760 --> 01:58:59,500
God damn.
I would love to have that place.

2282
01:58:59,560 --> 01:59:02,070
But in.
so those are kinds of her lost.

2283
01:59:02,071 --> 01:59:07,071
And as soon as that happened,
I heard somebody called me and I called 

2284
01:59:07,071 --> 01:59:08,140
lorenzo.
Lorenzo haggerty or dear friend.

2285
01:59:08,650 --> 01:59:10,390
I love that dude.
And I said,

2286
01:59:10,391 --> 01:59:15,391
lorenzo,
the ells have removed the incriminating 

2287
01:59:15,391 --> 01:59:17,800
evidence.
Again.

2288
01:59:17,920 --> 01:59:22,920
That's hilarious.
we have to rebuild terence mckenna from 

2289
01:59:22,920 --> 01:59:24,740
extent materials,
so it's like a grateful dead show thing.

2290
01:59:24,760 --> 01:59:26,290
Send in your cassette.

2291
01:59:26,440 --> 01:59:26,980
Well,
his,

2292
01:59:27,190 --> 01:59:32,190
one of his most problematic theories was
that novelty theory that the idea that 

2293
01:59:32,190 --> 01:59:36,870
december 20,
first 2012 there was going to be some 

2294
01:59:36,870 --> 01:59:39,270
point of infant novelty and he thought 
it was going to be a time machine 

2295
01:59:39,270 --> 01:59:39,270
perhaps

2296
01:59:39,270 --> 01:59:43,380
based on the each and so I got a packet 
of papers in the mail that I came 

2297
01:59:43,901 --> 01:59:48,901
through,
another archivist because I'm also 

2298
01:59:48,901 --> 01:59:50,461
handling timothy leary's,
the remnants of timothy leary's library 

2299
01:59:50,461 --> 01:59:51,230
right now that are,
you know,

2300
01:59:51,250 --> 01:59:53,410
we're trying to scan the news archive 
and whatever,

2301
01:59:53,411 --> 01:59:58,411
but this packet of material,
15 years of letters and there was a 

2302
01:59:58,411 --> 02:00:00,570
timewave zero edition,
you know,

2303
02:00:00,640 --> 02:00:03,640
in a little binder or whatever with 
terrence has a little writing on it.

2304
02:00:03,910 --> 02:00:07,420
And there was a post it note that we're 
terrence's scribbled something.

2305
02:00:07,421 --> 02:00:09,700
And then at the bottom he says December 
21st.

2306
02:00:10,300 --> 02:00:11,020
Yes,
yes,

2307
02:00:11,021 --> 02:00:14,260
yes.
On the bottom of this post it note 1989.

2308
02:00:14,860 --> 02:00:19,240
And so I scan that sucker in and put it 
online in december of $20.

2309
02:00:19,480 --> 02:00:24,280
here is the nefarious posted note where 
terrance finally settled on this date,

2310
02:00:24,281 --> 02:00:25,380
at least for terrence,
you know,

2311
02:00:25,381 --> 02:00:27,740
are they a wireless,
uh,

2312
02:00:28,020 --> 02:00:31,570
associate eric had been involved in this
too in the course.

2313
02:00:32,080 --> 02:00:34,600
But it says,
it comes down to this posted note in.

2314
02:00:36,310 --> 02:00:41,310
I wanted to put that up to sort of.
So the absurdity of this is a guy that 

2315
02:00:41,310 --> 02:00:44,980
doesn't really know terrorists,
wasn't a technologist and you know,

2316
02:00:45,430 --> 02:00:47,380
he was a visionary thinker.
We love him.

2317
02:00:47,381 --> 02:00:48,580
I mean,
he was an amazing dude.

2318
02:00:48,581 --> 02:00:50,980
We love to listen to him,
but I think you're right.

2319
02:00:50,981 --> 02:00:53,020
I think he was off the rails on friday

2320
02:00:53,060 --> 02:00:56,440
too much into that one thing.
And not only that,

2321
02:00:56,450 --> 02:00:58,640
didn't he move the goalposts like at one
point in time,

2322
02:00:58,641 --> 02:01:03,641
it wasn't december 20.
First it was like november or something 

2323
02:01:03,641 --> 02:01:03,641
and they changed it.

2324
02:01:03,641 --> 02:01:05,760
He changed it and he was trying to fit 
the data to the curve,

2325
02:01:06,210 --> 02:01:09,420
but he wasn't really an expert in trends
and history.

2326
02:01:09,421 --> 02:01:11,520
And how can you match trends in history 
to anything.

2327
02:01:11,521 --> 02:01:11,850
Anyway,

2328
02:01:11,950 --> 02:01:15,010
I would listen to him talk about that.
This is the one thing that I had to shut

2329
02:01:15,011 --> 02:01:20,011
off.
I've listened to pretty much everything 

2330
02:01:20,011 --> 02:01:20,710
that he's ever done,
all of the lorenzo archives,

2331
02:01:20,711 --> 02:01:24,310
all the stuff that yana and put up way 
back in the day to

2332
02:01:24,330 --> 02:01:29,330
podcasts.
Three 16 in the salon because that one 

2333
02:01:29,330 --> 02:01:33,470
we kind of take this thing apart and 
I've met with ralph abraham.

2334
02:01:33,750 --> 02:01:38,750
We meet once A year kind of thing and 
then 2011 I was setting up to do a 

2335
02:01:38,750 --> 02:01:41,600
program called terrence 2012 about the 
life of terence mckenna.

2336
02:01:42,170 --> 02:01:44,360
And I met with ralph and I said,
tell me ralph,

2337
02:01:44,420 --> 02:01:46,680
what was going on in the late nineties 
because you know,

2338
02:01:46,710 --> 02:01:49,700
they're the trial or ralph rupert who 
was on your show,

2339
02:01:50,270 --> 02:01:51,240
ralph abraham.
And,

2340
02:01:51,530 --> 02:01:56,530
and ralph said,
we kind of were getting fed up because 

2341
02:01:56,530 --> 02:01:59,200
terrence was just spinning these stories
and we didn't think they had any,

2342
02:01:59,230 --> 02:02:03,780
any basis.
And so at the 1998 trial logs,

2343
02:02:03,980 --> 02:02:04,870
you know,
the trials were,

2344
02:02:04,880 --> 02:02:07,040
were they all met?
And they talked to you there at uc santa

2345
02:02:07,041 --> 02:02:07,580
cruz.
He said,

2346
02:02:07,581 --> 02:02:10,090
if you listen to that rupert,
nice,

2347
02:02:10,130 --> 02:02:11,600
set a trap for terrence.

2348
02:02:11,600 --> 02:02:16,600
We trapped him over and over again and 
we basically for an hour he was 

2349
02:02:16,600 --> 02:02:18,590
squirming and he was pretty up.
Pretty uncomfortable slide.

2350
02:02:18,800 --> 02:02:23,800
Pull out our cassette tape of that and 
we have digitized it and sure and 

2351
02:02:23,800 --> 02:02:26,660
behold,
and you'll hear this within podcast 3:16

2352
02:02:26,661 --> 02:02:30,290
and what rupert says,
it's terrence is talking about,

2353
02:02:30,890 --> 02:02:35,890
you know,
the internet will come to consciousness 

2354
02:02:35,890 --> 02:02:35,890
in 20 minutes or less,
you know,

2355
02:02:35,890 --> 02:02:38,420
it will be an ai that will no longer 
need us.

2356
02:02:38,421 --> 02:02:41,090
And so rupert was ready for that and 
said,

2357
02:02:41,510 --> 02:02:42,530
terrence,
uh,

2358
02:02:42,531 --> 02:02:47,531
I've heard reports of voice.
You had him here and I've heard 10 

2359
02:02:47,531 --> 02:02:49,310
versions of this story.
And then the last version,

2360
02:02:49,540 --> 02:02:52,100
it was an ai coming out of a time 
portal.

2361
02:02:52,520 --> 02:02:57,520
No,
because they're not going to let them 

2362
02:02:57,520 --> 02:02:57,960
get away with this.
And terrence is such a good irish.

2363
02:02:58,070 --> 02:02:59,330
Right?
He's such Good on,

2364
02:02:59,840 --> 02:03:01,130
you know,
storytelling,

2365
02:03:01,160 --> 02:03:02,420
storytelling,
and he's good with.

2366
02:03:02,780 --> 02:03:06,510
And he says,
and that to 10.

2367
02:03:08,300 --> 02:03:09,860
But at the end of that,
it's very,

2368
02:03:09,861 --> 02:03:14,861
very heartfelt and kind of terrence 
realizes his friends have kind of drawn 

2369
02:03:14,861 --> 02:03:16,700
a line in the sand.
And the last thing he says in that trial

2370
02:03:16,710 --> 02:03:21,710
august,
well we want profits but we don't want 

2371
02:03:21,710 --> 02:03:23,210
false prophets.
So,

2372
02:03:23,270 --> 02:03:28,270
you know,
I think the story was the thing at that 

2373
02:03:28,270 --> 02:03:28,270
time.

2374
02:03:28,270 --> 02:03:28,590
So do you think that he just got carried
away with it?

2375
02:03:28,650 --> 02:03:33,650
Like is it mean obviously he liked you 
and I like everyone we know is flawed as

2376
02:03:34,411 --> 02:03:39,411
a person and he also,
part of the reason why he was as 

2377
02:03:39,991 --> 02:03:42,510
visionary,
sort of out of the box thinker,

2378
02:03:42,511 --> 02:03:47,511
this guy who had this really incredible 
way of describing potential 

2379
02:03:47,941 --> 02:03:52,941
possibilities was that his mind was 
prone to going on these little weird 

2380
02:03:52,941 --> 02:03:57,441
journeys and took a lot of chances and 
maybe might have been married to a few 

2381
02:03:57,441 --> 02:03:59,040
of these chances that maybe shouldn't 
have

2382
02:03:59,740 --> 02:04:02,350
you have dennis.
Dennis was in The introduction,

2383
02:04:02,351 --> 02:04:07,351
I think,
to the second version of invisible 

2384
02:04:07,351 --> 02:04:07,351
landscape.
dennis is writing,

2385
02:04:07,351 --> 02:04:07,900
you know,
this is what we went through and we were

2386
02:04:07,901 --> 02:04:10,750
in our twenties and we've learned 
something since then.

2387
02:04:10,751 --> 02:04:13,190
We don't really know,
I don't believe this anymore,

2388
02:04:13,191 --> 02:04:14,420
and,
and you know,

2389
02:04:14,440 --> 02:04:18,100
I think it's almost like in this could 
happen to any of us.

2390
02:04:18,610 --> 02:04:21,010
We get attached to a story.
That's our shtick.

2391
02:04:21,011 --> 02:04:23,080
It's our comedy act.
It's our thing.

2392
02:04:23,081 --> 02:04:28,081
We do our conspiracy theory.
It's the thing that brings people into 

2393
02:04:28,081 --> 02:04:30,040
the seats,
fills the theaters,

2394
02:04:30,370 --> 02:04:33,900
and if it's paying your bills and it 
gives you self worth and whatnot,

2395
02:04:33,910 --> 02:04:35,830
you can get really attached to that 
story.

2396
02:04:35,831 --> 02:04:37,560
it's very unfortunate,
you know,

2397
02:04:37,561 --> 02:04:38,070
because

2398
02:04:38,370 --> 02:04:41,490
the rest of terrence's ideas were so 
fascinating.

2399
02:04:41,491 --> 02:04:46,491
Compelling and listen to them talk about
the positive benefits of psychedelics,

2400
02:04:47,590 --> 02:04:52,590
what he thinks the potential of 
psychedelics hold and what he thinks 

2401
02:04:52,590 --> 02:04:54,450
about psychedelic culture.
and there's so much fascinating.

2402
02:04:54,480 --> 02:04:55,290
Absolutely fast.

2403
02:04:55,390 --> 02:04:59,440
I love the amount of him.
He was terrence for me.

2404
02:04:59,500 --> 02:05:04,500
I can tell you,
and I only knew him the last couple of 

2405
02:05:04,500 --> 02:05:04,500
years.
We didn't know he was on his way out.

2406
02:05:04,500 --> 02:05:04,810
Frankly.
You know,

2407
02:05:04,811 --> 02:05:07,960
we did this whole fantastic thing with.
We brought virtual worlds,

2408
02:05:07,961 --> 02:05:10,720
sos house in Hawaii office,
satellite dish,

2409
02:05:11,200 --> 02:05:14,050
and he was placed into a world and he 
became his own ghost.

2410
02:05:14,051 --> 02:05:19,051
The avatar was fantastic and I was 
looking forward to a long association 

2411
02:05:19,051 --> 02:05:23,161
with him and we were planning to an 
excellent workshop where he and I could 

2412
02:05:23,161 --> 02:05:26,821
do pieces of the same puzzle like I 
could do like the deep tech and weird 

2413
02:05:27,071 --> 02:05:30,010
ideas and stuff,
but it was based on science and tech and

2414
02:05:30,040 --> 02:05:34,150
some visionary thing and he would come 
in from his history side and elusive and

2415
02:05:34,151 --> 02:05:39,151
all that stuff and we were going to go 
on the road and then he had a grand mal 

2416
02:05:39,151 --> 02:05:43,201
seizure two months later and it was 
horrific and we saw him last in 

2417
02:05:43,201 --> 02:05:46,981
september,
[inaudible] 99 and it was like a good 

2418
02:05:46,981 --> 02:05:46,981
event that was held.

2419
02:05:46,981 --> 02:05:50,500
If he was around today,
is there sufficient medical advances 

2420
02:05:50,500 --> 02:05:50,960
that would have helped him?

2421
02:05:51,080 --> 02:05:54,090
You know,
a glioblastoma multiforme is,

2422
02:05:54,140 --> 02:05:57,860
they're so rare and they have a really 
bad prognosis.

2423
02:05:58,100 --> 02:06:01,220
I mean he had gamma knife surgery and I 
think it was november.

2424
02:06:01,730 --> 02:06:04,880
I mean Eric Davis has last interview.
The interview.

2425
02:06:04,881 --> 02:06:08,090
Eric davis is wonderful from Hawaii 
right from,

2426
02:06:08,120 --> 02:06:13,120
from,
actually it might've been on the 

2427
02:06:13,120 --> 02:06:15,070
mainland.
You hear a lot of dishes in the 

2428
02:06:15,070 --> 02:06:15,070
background.
That wouldn't be the model for.

2429
02:06:15,070 --> 02:06:16,610
He might've been an occidental during 
that one,

2430
02:06:16,611 --> 02:06:21,611
after the surgery,
but he's so beautifully cogent and 

2431
02:06:21,611 --> 02:06:22,130
coherent that mean he says he's a 
master.

2432
02:06:22,460 --> 02:06:24,830
He's.
He's so in his heart.

2433
02:06:24,831 --> 02:06:29,831
He's so brilliant and you know,
he's on all these antiseizure drugs and 

2434
02:06:29,831 --> 02:06:31,490
everything.
One of the things he does say,

2435
02:06:31,491 --> 02:06:32,960
which was this,
he said,

2436
02:06:33,260 --> 02:06:38,260
you need to rethink this thing because 
I'm an altered spaces because I'm on 

2437
02:06:39,381 --> 02:06:43,880
massive medications because I have a 
brain disease because,

2438
02:06:44,110 --> 02:06:48,920
and there are people walking around that
are certifiably in altered states and we

2439
02:06:48,921 --> 02:06:53,921
shouldn't just privilege psychedelics.
There are so many avenues into alternate

2440
02:06:55,671 --> 02:07:00,671
realities is allowed us to see the world
and I'm just experienced them and that's

2441
02:07:00,801 --> 02:07:05,801
part of what my mission in the world is 
to say don't privilege these substances 

2442
02:07:06,170 --> 02:07:08,060
because then they become crutches.
You can.

2443
02:07:08,450 --> 02:07:11,150
Terrence used to say,
you can't do this on the couch,

2444
02:07:11,480 --> 02:07:16,480
you know,
but I've since met a lot of people that 

2445
02:07:16,480 --> 02:07:17,990
are going to profound spaces through 
other means.

2446
02:07:18,110 --> 02:07:19,760
Yeah.
I think he was a bit.

2447
02:07:20,960 --> 02:07:25,960
I think he was a little hasty in his,
his proclamation that this isn't 

2448
02:07:25,960 --> 02:07:30,220
capable,
this is impossible under natural 

2449
02:07:30,220 --> 02:07:32,450
conditions because I have a friend who 
has had psychedelic experiences.

2450
02:07:32,451 --> 02:07:34,970
He's not averse to it.
He's a regular marijuana user.

2451
02:07:35,140 --> 02:07:35,710
He's also

2452
02:07:36,490 --> 02:07:40,900
a kundalini expert and he's become a 
kundalini expert since I've known him.

2453
02:07:41,140 --> 02:07:44,080
So over the lAst 10 years has been 
practicing.

2454
02:07:44,081 --> 02:07:47,890
I've known him for about 10 years,
has been practicing clue a very,

2455
02:07:47,891 --> 02:07:52,300
very intensely over the past four or 
five and since then he says,

2456
02:07:52,360 --> 02:07:57,360
he goes,
I have deep dmt experiences doing 

2457
02:07:57,360 --> 02:07:58,780
kundalini and I have no reason to doubt 
him.

2458
02:07:59,110 --> 02:08:02,140
I have another friend who does a 
different type of medication,

2459
02:08:02,310 --> 02:08:03,640
some,
some sort of a.

2460
02:08:03,660 --> 02:08:08,660
It's not kundalini,
but some sort of meditation and he also 

2461
02:08:08,660 --> 02:08:09,430
says that he's like,
I have legit,

2462
02:08:09,570 --> 02:08:12,980
full blown psychedelic experiences and I
think I'm,

2463
02:08:13,300 --> 02:08:18,300
I'm starting to research this and I'm 
actually going to be working on a book 

2464
02:08:18,300 --> 02:08:20,680
on this thing because I keep running 
into these people and I call it.

2465
02:08:20,681 --> 02:08:22,720
And you know,
we taught indogenous,

2466
02:08:22,990 --> 02:08:27,990
so I'm using the term endo endo beings 
or endo voyaging or whatever.

2467
02:08:28,400 --> 02:08:32,140
Using your own endogenous ability,
because I do it,

2468
02:08:32,260 --> 02:08:37,260
I think it's just unbelievably difficult
to do and I think some people are just 

2469
02:08:37,260 --> 02:08:38,530
lazy.
I think that's really a part of it.

2470
02:08:38,531 --> 02:08:43,531
It's also physical effort.
There's a lot of people that are 

2471
02:08:43,531 --> 02:08:45,430
investing a tremendous amount of time 
and thinking calculation postulating,

2472
02:08:45,640 --> 02:08:49,930
but the physical effort of meditation is
beyond them and that's one of the things

2473
02:08:49,931 --> 02:08:54,931
that mckenna talked about.
Terrance talked about all the time how 

2474
02:08:54,931 --> 02:08:55,590
boring meditation was,
so incredibly.

2475
02:08:55,640 --> 02:09:00,640
Blood had a flash insight.
Joe were to come back to the original 

2476
02:09:00,640 --> 02:09:05,251
theme that we're talking about.
Why did the ancients could do this 

2477
02:09:05,251 --> 02:09:07,250
amazing stuff that we're now 
discovering?

2478
02:09:07,260 --> 02:09:11,350
It's like currently high tech because 
they weren't distracted.

2479
02:09:11,650 --> 02:09:13,330
What could they do?
It's true.

2480
02:09:13,390 --> 02:09:14,500
No internet,
no twitter.

2481
02:09:14,560 --> 02:09:16,330
You can check their faceBook every 10 
minutEs.

2482
02:09:17,010 --> 02:09:22,010
They could.
A guy could look at a pile of rocks and 

2483
02:09:22,010 --> 02:09:25,351
see the full structure of the pyramid 
and it's in his head or her head with 

2484
02:09:25,351 --> 02:09:29,401
water flowers and they perhaps because 
they're not so distracted in a stimulus 

2485
02:09:29,561 --> 02:09:34,561
response,
cortisol being shot in and interrupts 

2486
02:09:34,561 --> 02:09:36,520
and to do lists and whatnot,
just massively distracted.

2487
02:09:36,850 --> 02:09:41,540
Those guys were using full power of this
endogenous power and maybe a loose.

2488
02:09:41,541 --> 02:09:45,340
this was unlocking net.
It's also possible that they didn't have

2489
02:09:45,370 --> 02:09:50,370
the predetermined limitations that we 
have when we consider like what normal 

2490
02:09:50,370 --> 02:09:54,451
states of consciousness exists.
We have this idea of list exists and 

2491
02:09:54,451 --> 02:09:54,930
then if you want more than that,
you got to take acid.

2492
02:09:55,270 --> 02:09:57,220
If you want more than that,
you've got to get on prozac.

2493
02:09:57,221 --> 02:09:59,410
If you bought more than this,
you know you have to be drunk.

2494
02:09:59,411 --> 02:10:00,610
You have to be this,
you have to be that.

2495
02:10:00,730 --> 02:10:03,910
So we have these preconceived notions 
about altered states of consciousness,

2496
02:10:03,940 --> 02:10:06,550
brilliant insight and,
and,

2497
02:10:06,680 --> 02:10:11,680
and we're so channeled and managed in a 
technologically are driving like driving

2498
02:10:13,601 --> 02:10:14,980
here.
I mean,

2499
02:10:15,340 --> 02:10:18,200
we drove down the back of California 
from santa cruz ceremony,

2500
02:10:18,370 --> 02:10:20,650
some of those beautiful landscaping.
Amazing.

2501
02:10:20,680 --> 02:10:23,590
Kayla and I are looking at this glowing 
light coming off the ocean,

2502
02:10:23,591 --> 02:10:26,440
like what you saw at big sur.
Those dudes,

2503
02:10:26,441 --> 02:10:29,830
I mean we get a little snatch of it,
but we don't have the full experience.

2504
02:10:29,831 --> 02:10:34,040
We're not standing on the shore smelling
the plants in a full body

2505
02:10:34,040 --> 02:10:37,190
of health being impacted by those 
photons coming,

2506
02:10:37,430 --> 02:10:42,170
giving us an enlightened states because 
we're driving past it and we're watching

2507
02:10:42,171 --> 02:10:47,171
our time and our gas levels and whatnot 
and we're out of tune.

2508
02:10:47,540 --> 02:10:48,290
We're not present.

2509
02:10:48,370 --> 02:10:50,350
I've talked about this many times on the
podcast.

2510
02:10:50,351 --> 02:10:55,351
I had a really life changing experience.
It had nothing to do with drugs and it 

2511
02:10:55,351 --> 02:10:56,890
was.
I went to the big island.

2512
02:10:56,891 --> 02:10:58,550
I went to the keck observatory.
Wow.

2513
02:10:59,150 --> 02:11:03,850
It just went because I was on vacation 
with my family there and we went to the.

2514
02:11:04,240 --> 02:11:07,310
There's two levels to the observatories 
is the main observatory and then there's

2515
02:11:07,311 --> 02:11:11,140
the visitors area and the visitors are 
just have a bunch of telescopes set out.

2516
02:11:11,141 --> 02:11:16,141
It's pretty cool,
but it's so high that it's above the 

2517
02:11:16,141 --> 02:11:16,300
clouds clouded area.
Was it clear?

2518
02:11:16,330 --> 02:11:20,260
Was it totaLly close,
cloudy below us or was just fascinating.

2519
02:11:20,470 --> 02:11:21,730
We were bummed out.
We were like,

2520
02:11:21,760 --> 02:11:23,320
oh man,
we're going to hit clouds.

2521
02:11:23,321 --> 02:11:26,170
we're not gonna see anything,
but we actually drove through the clouds

2522
02:11:26,410 --> 02:11:31,410
and because they have the diffused 
lighting all over the big island to 

2523
02:11:31,410 --> 02:11:31,870
protect the observatory from light 
pollution.

2524
02:11:32,350 --> 02:11:36,240
Man,
the view was stunning.

2525
02:11:36,260 --> 02:11:41,260
The milky way was so bright and clear 
and there's so many stars in the sky and

2526
02:11:42,011 --> 02:11:47,011
it was a perfect night.
I went back recently and I made a 

2527
02:11:47,011 --> 02:11:47,800
mistake and went back when it was a full
moon and it was.

2528
02:11:47,850 --> 02:11:49,660
It was actually a super moon.
It was awful.

2529
02:11:49,710 --> 02:11:52,710
I think august,
august was the moon.

2530
02:11:52,750 --> 02:11:55,060
It was still beautiful and amazing and 
still like,

2531
02:11:55,061 --> 02:11:57,010
wow,
that's a planet floating above us,

2532
02:11:57,340 --> 02:12:00,460
but nothing like the first trip and that
trip,

2533
02:12:00,700 --> 02:12:05,700
being there and seeing those stars,
you've got to think that is what early 

2534
02:12:05,700 --> 02:12:09,520
man saw every day.
They were just awash in the mystery.

2535
02:12:09,521 --> 02:12:12,180
That is the sky and they paid attention 
so much.

2536
02:12:12,230 --> 02:12:14,260
They knew its shape,
changes,

2537
02:12:14,760 --> 02:12:19,760
wobble of the eaRth.
They knew about the procession of the 

2538
02:12:19,760 --> 02:12:19,760
equinoxes.
They had it mapped out,

2539
02:12:19,930 --> 02:12:24,930
I mean there's so much that they had 
figured out that the equinox procession 

2540
02:12:24,980 --> 02:12:25,570
is,
look what,

2541
02:12:25,571 --> 02:12:28,450
26,000
years somehow or another.

2542
02:12:28,451 --> 02:12:33,130
These people had figured a lot of that 
out a long time ago

2543
02:12:33,220 --> 02:12:38,220
and it may have been just total presence
and that they built the model in their 

2544
02:12:38,220 --> 02:12:41,951
head with their own dmt,
if you'd call it that are endogenously 

2545
02:12:41,951 --> 02:12:43,430
or who knows.
I'm sure they took drugs to.

2546
02:12:43,460 --> 02:12:46,340
Here's a show that was a part of it as 
it was that as well.

2547
02:12:46,370 --> 02:12:50,750
Here's another good one.
Her friend andrew was commissioned.

2548
02:12:50,751 --> 02:12:55,751
He's an incredible painter and he was 
commissioned to paint the caves of last 

2549
02:12:55,751 --> 02:12:55,751
scope,
a co.

2550
02:12:55,751 --> 02:13:00,260
Andrew johnstone,
a complete reconstruction of an on like 

2551
02:13:00,260 --> 02:13:01,430
a surface.
It was the same rock face,

2552
02:13:01,460 --> 02:13:03,350
but it was for like a restaurant or 
something.

2553
02:13:03,440 --> 02:13:05,420
Oh wow.
And so he got all these,

2554
02:13:05,780 --> 02:13:06,950
you know,
different.

2555
02:13:07,010 --> 02:13:12,010
You can't go in there.
I guess it's people's breath will 

2556
02:13:12,010 --> 02:13:12,380
destroy it,
but he started to paint this,

2557
02:13:12,390 --> 02:13:14,090
this,
you're going to really tune into this.

2558
02:13:14,450 --> 02:13:18,650
He stArted to paint this inside this 
restaurant with the rock face and he was

2559
02:13:18,651 --> 02:13:23,651
painting the copy of it and he would go 
out at night because he had to paint at 

2560
02:13:23,651 --> 02:13:27,371
night because the restaurant was in 
business and he would just know his 

2561
02:13:27,371 --> 02:13:29,540
break and whatever,
and he started to study the sky and then

2562
02:13:29,541 --> 02:13:31,830
we'd go back and paint more of the 
bowls,

2563
02:13:31,831 --> 02:13:33,870
horns and the running,
missing that,

2564
02:13:33,871 --> 02:13:36,810
and he would go back and after all this 
time he started,

2565
02:13:36,811 --> 02:13:41,010
wait a minute,
I'm seeing lusko in the sky,

2566
02:13:41,011 --> 02:13:42,120
but it's a little different.

2567
02:13:42,440 --> 02:13:47,440
And he would go back and look at,
he was reconstructIng also go from the 

2568
02:13:47,440 --> 02:13:49,290
lowest detail and he said,
this is a fricking star map.

2569
02:13:49,980 --> 02:13:54,980
This is a star map.
And he actually submitted a publication 

2570
02:13:54,980 --> 02:13:57,650
to an archeological journal,
I don't know,

2571
02:13:57,700 --> 02:13:58,900
was reviewed.
Uh,

2572
02:13:59,140 --> 02:14:00,630
you know,
I don't know what happened.

2573
02:14:00,631 --> 02:14:05,631
I think he wasn't reviewed well because 
I don't think that it's in the 

2574
02:14:05,631 --> 02:14:06,510
literature and I'm not seeing it now,
chris,

2575
02:14:06,511 --> 02:14:08,490
the stars are in a slightly different 
position,

2576
02:14:08,491 --> 02:14:09,800
right?
Let's constellations work,

2577
02:14:10,500 --> 02:14:12,330
but you know,
it doesn't,

2578
02:14:12,660 --> 02:14:14,310
it's fucking powerful,

2579
02:14:14,580 --> 02:14:17,870
but isn't it one of those things we can 
kind of see patterns if you want to like

2580
02:14:17,910 --> 02:14:18,310
go,
oh,

2581
02:14:18,311 --> 02:14:20,280
I see a bowl.
I mean we have,

2582
02:14:20,520 --> 02:14:21,990
there's some patterns like the big 
dipper,

2583
02:14:21,991 --> 02:14:22,290
like,
oh,

2584
02:14:22,291 --> 02:14:23,400
it's big dipper,
right?

2585
02:14:23,490 --> 02:14:25,600
But when you see all the stars behind 
the changes,

2586
02:14:25,650 --> 02:14:27,390
make up your own fucking patterns.
You know,

2587
02:14:27,730 --> 02:14:32,730
the big dipper represents to me is like 
an established pattern that you know 

2588
02:14:32,730 --> 02:14:36,201
exists.
So you can call it the big dipper and 

2589
02:14:36,201 --> 02:14:36,201
say it's a dipper,
but what it,

2590
02:14:36,201 --> 02:14:36,350
what it is,
is just,

2591
02:14:36,390 --> 02:14:37,360
oh,
that's that,

2592
02:14:37,540 --> 02:14:40,870
that there they are there.
If you know.

2593
02:14:40,900 --> 02:14:41,970
Oh,
I see a bull.

2594
02:14:41,971 --> 02:14:43,230
Well,
you're already fucking painting a bowl,

2595
02:14:43,231 --> 02:14:43,870
dude.
You know,

2596
02:14:43,910 --> 02:14:45,150
of course you're seeing a bowl in the 
sky,

2597
02:14:45,590 --> 02:14:46,650
right?
Could be good.

2598
02:14:46,710 --> 02:14:50,460
Plus you fucking stiff and pain all day.
You're out of your head going outside,

2599
02:14:50,461 --> 02:14:53,460
you're delusional.
You're tired right now.

2600
02:14:53,600 --> 02:14:56,760
Be a lot of things going on there.
It wasn't reviewed very well.

2601
02:14:57,240 --> 02:15:02,130
maybe not a blue wig and started writing
a paper on it and everybody's okay.

2602
02:15:02,160 --> 02:15:04,710
How much paint do you paint?
Are you using?

2603
02:15:04,711 --> 02:15:06,300
Right?
How close are you to this pain?

2604
02:15:06,420 --> 02:15:09,720
Then we get.
We run into the mind of science.

2605
02:15:09,790 --> 02:15:11,190
Yes,
of course.

2606
02:15:11,250 --> 02:15:14,970
It's and it's born to critique has to,
right?

2607
02:15:14,971 --> 02:15:17,400
It has to so much fuckery.
You have to.

2608
02:15:17,760 --> 02:15:19,870
Because it's one of the only human 
enterprise.

2609
02:15:19,871 --> 02:15:21,160
It is making progress.

2610
02:15:21,190 --> 02:15:26,190
Well,
think about your friend that you were 

2611
02:15:26,190 --> 02:15:26,190
talking about that was in a fucking 
cult.

2612
02:15:26,190 --> 02:15:28,120
The thought that aliens made the 
pyramids that led him to actual science.

2613
02:15:28,360 --> 02:15:31,060
The science actually set him free from 
the cult.

2614
02:15:31,110 --> 02:15:32,230
It did.
It did.

2615
02:15:32,231 --> 02:15:34,810
Indeed.
Doesn't mean that's the whole reason why

2616
02:15:34,811 --> 02:15:36,670
it has to question everything.
It has to go.

2617
02:15:36,671 --> 02:15:41,671
Okay,
what did you see up there in the sky 

2618
02:15:41,671 --> 02:15:41,671
while you're sniffinG paint pal.
That's right.

2619
02:15:41,671 --> 02:15:43,600
You know,
the cults can waste a lot of minds and a

2620
02:15:43,601 --> 02:15:47,290
lot of lives then that's charismatic.
Leaders are very dangerous,

2621
02:15:47,710 --> 02:15:52,710
especially when they want to lead.
And also I think that the intoxicating 

2622
02:15:54,040 --> 02:15:56,020
nature of being that leader.

2623
02:15:56,140 --> 02:16:01,140
What do you think of,
you know the talk about sociopathy and 

2624
02:16:01,140 --> 02:16:03,781
psychopathy and that that's a certain 
percentage of the population is lacking 

2625
02:16:03,781 --> 02:16:05,200
a brain region that just doesn't have 
it.

2626
02:16:05,201 --> 02:16:10,201
when they put the system together,
that's there's no empathic part of the 

2627
02:16:10,751 --> 02:16:12,550
brain.
Do you think,

2628
02:16:12,551 --> 02:16:17,551
I'm asking you on on the air here,
I mean this sounds like a eugenics kind 

2629
02:16:17,551 --> 02:16:22,111
of a thing,
but do you think a future society or 

2630
02:16:22,111 --> 02:16:24,721
future earth ought to screen people when
they're young kids when they're young to

2631
02:16:24,881 --> 02:16:29,881
find out if their potential psychopaths 
and sociopaths and give them different

2632
02:16:30,130 --> 02:16:34,990
trainings and not allow them say to run 
armies and countries and stuff like that

2633
02:16:34,991 --> 02:16:37,510
because they're just not going to have 
the empathic response.

2634
02:16:37,511 --> 02:16:41,350
Like if you had poor vision,
you shouldn't pilot an airliner,

2635
02:16:41,351 --> 02:16:46,351
for example.
It's a physiological thing that makes 

2636
02:16:46,351 --> 02:16:47,680
you kind of not suited for certain kinds
of jobs.

2637
02:16:48,500 --> 02:16:53,500
Can be proven that this is like there's 
an undeniable correlation between this 

2638
02:16:53,500 --> 02:16:58,411
particular area of the brain and lacking
empathy in that you cannot be a good 

2639
02:16:58,411 --> 02:16:58,690
leader.
You cannot be a good.

2640
02:17:00,070 --> 02:17:03,670
There's so many factors like saying to 
someone can't be,

2641
02:17:03,730 --> 02:17:06,310
if they lack empathy,
they can't be a good leader,

2642
02:17:06,400 --> 02:17:11,400
but what if those same factors that led 
them to lack empathy also lead them to 

2643
02:17:13,571 --> 02:17:18,571
lack a certain amount of ego that would 
kind of fuck up being a leadeR or law 

2644
02:17:19,930 --> 02:17:24,930
they laid,
lacked a certain amount of need to be 

2645
02:17:24,930 --> 02:17:28,891
charismatic,
right desire to have all these people 

2646
02:17:28,891 --> 02:17:31,891
follow you,
like certain high functioning autistic 

2647
02:17:31,891 --> 02:17:34,741
folks have incredible skills in a lot of
areas that maybe people that have 

2648
02:17:35,080 --> 02:17:40,080
extreme connections to emotions or to 
social interaction might not develop.

2649
02:17:40,570 --> 02:17:43,360
So I don't necessArily know that we 
understand.

2650
02:17:43,370 --> 02:17:48,370
You just don't know all the potential 
possibilities when it comes to human 

2651
02:17:48,370 --> 02:17:49,350
interaction and messing with that.
There's just a,

2652
02:17:49,660 --> 02:17:52,870
there's this weird range of what is a 
person,

2653
02:17:52,900 --> 02:17:54,760
right?
And to say that,

2654
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:58,750
but there's also people that have taken 
those psychopath tests and you know,

2655
02:17:58,751 --> 02:18:00,760
they will technically I'm supposed to be
a psychopath.

2656
02:18:00,761 --> 02:18:03,640
meanwhile,
I'm a functioning rational,

2657
02:18:03,641 --> 02:18:07,810
normal member of my community.
I'm a loving father and husband and,

2658
02:18:07,811 --> 02:18:09,160
and um,
everything's great.

2659
02:18:09,220 --> 02:18:14,220
So what the fuck,
like why does this test say I'm a 

2660
02:18:14,220 --> 02:18:14,220
psycho,
right?

2661
02:18:14,220 --> 02:18:15,490
I don't know.
I don't know if we haven't nailed yet.

2662
02:18:15,740 --> 02:18:20,740
The problem comes when we get 
psychopaths doing really terrible shit 

2663
02:18:20,740 --> 02:18:23,310
like dictators and stuff like that and 
we can't get rid of them.

2664
02:18:24,050 --> 02:18:26,270
Then the damage isn't being done and we 
can't do any.

2665
02:18:26,440 --> 02:18:29,260
And what makes them a psychopath in the 
first place.

2666
02:18:29,260 --> 02:18:34,260
Like a perfect example is saddam 
hussein's children who were notoriously 

2667
02:18:34,260 --> 02:18:37,120
evil,
uday and qusay,

2668
02:18:37,130 --> 02:18:42,130
where names were two of the most 
horrific human beings that we've ever 

2669
02:18:42,130 --> 02:18:43,340
seen come out of the,
the,

2670
02:18:43,380 --> 02:18:44,220
the,
you know,

2671
02:18:44,240 --> 02:18:47,070
the brute of a diCtator.
I mean he,

2672
02:18:47,071 --> 02:18:49,680
he developed some unbelievably evil 
children.

2673
02:18:50,050 --> 02:18:51,850
Now,
why is it that they were evil?

2674
02:18:51,851 --> 02:18:53,560
Is it the environment?
Is a nurture?

2675
02:18:53,561 --> 02:18:55,480
Is it nature?
Is it genetics?

2676
02:18:55,481 --> 02:18:57,970
Is it epigenetics?
Like what is it that.

2677
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:02,770
Is it just being unbelievably spoiled?
Because you have ultimate power from the

2678
02:19:02,771 --> 02:19:04,990
time you were a child and you're 
essentially royalty.

2679
02:19:05,230 --> 02:19:06,670
What is it?
What causes that?

2680
02:19:07,120 --> 02:19:12,120
It's possible that our survival as a 
species is going to come down to how 

2681
02:19:13,180 --> 02:19:16,930
well we unhealthily we manager our 
children.

2682
02:19:16,931 --> 02:19:19,990
I mean ultimately if we're.
If we're not doing that,

2683
02:19:20,430 --> 02:19:23,910
then like if for instance you were 
building a mars colony,

2684
02:19:23,930 --> 02:19:28,930
was going to have 250 people in it and 
they're going to have children or 

2685
02:19:28,930 --> 02:19:28,930
whatever.
You

2686
02:19:28,930 --> 02:19:32,900
would know that if you get one kind of 
crazy revolutionary leader that does the

2687
02:19:32,901 --> 02:19:37,901
whole charismatic thing and whatever,
and then there's a shooting thing is 

2688
02:19:37,901 --> 02:19:39,290
going to shoot a hole so the dome and 
everyone's going to die.

2689
02:19:39,291 --> 02:19:44,291
So you can't ever afford that.
So you have this careful management of 

2690
02:19:44,291 --> 02:19:48,371
human psychology within that call on you
to make sure it's healthy and watch 

2691
02:19:48,371 --> 02:19:52,951
those processes and it.
To some extent the scandinavians did 

2692
02:19:52,951 --> 02:19:55,760
this a thousand years ago.
The scandinavians have the vikings.

2693
02:19:55,910 --> 02:19:59,300
when they had their war parties,
the leader of the war party,

2694
02:19:59,301 --> 02:20:02,930
they would go and invade east anglia or 
all the way to greenland,

2695
02:20:02,931 --> 02:20:06,650
labrador and what they called these guys
the preserve or kinks,

2696
02:20:06,950 --> 02:20:11,950
and these guys were put in charge and 
then they would go and they will do 

2697
02:20:11,950 --> 02:20:14,231
terrible shit.
I mean they would terrorize and murder 

2698
02:20:14,231 --> 02:20:15,320
and whatnot,
but when they settled east anglia,

2699
02:20:15,350 --> 02:20:17,690
when they built york,
york,

2700
02:20:17,900 --> 02:20:19,610
right,
they excavated it.

2701
02:20:20,060 --> 02:20:21,950
Well,
the vikings are now settled,

2702
02:20:22,070 --> 02:20:24,470
so they took the.
The worker king.

2703
02:20:24,500 --> 02:20:26,690
Thank you very much.
You've done your job.

2704
02:20:27,050 --> 02:20:31,940
You get the nice little grass hut at the
edge of town and you're off duty because

2705
02:20:31,941 --> 02:20:34,760
we can't afford that.
Now we have to build a community.

2706
02:20:35,050 --> 02:20:37,720
So what will they do with him?
You did retire them off.

2707
02:20:37,930 --> 02:20:39,910
Retired to mob and how you keep them 
from killing people.

2708
02:20:39,911 --> 02:20:40,630
I'm going nutty.

2709
02:20:40,760 --> 02:20:42,620
He just.
Nobody would follow him as the rules.

2710
02:20:42,621 --> 02:20:44,360
It was the.
It was the way that they did it.

2711
02:20:44,540 --> 02:20:47,600
So when you look at how sane scandinavia
is today,

2712
02:20:47,601 --> 02:20:48,840
maybe they got all that out.

2713
02:20:50,360 --> 02:20:52,830
That's a funny.
That's a very funny thought.

2714
02:20:53,700 --> 02:20:55,360
That who knows,
who knows,

2715
02:20:55,390 --> 02:21:00,390
who knows.
I think it's also there is a potential 

2716
02:21:00,390 --> 02:21:01,290
for technology to play a part in all 
this.

2717
02:21:01,710 --> 02:21:06,710
I think that one of the things that's 
coming out with technology is access to 

2718
02:21:06,710 --> 02:21:09,120
information and access to information.
Not just current information,

2719
02:21:09,121 --> 02:21:14,121
but I'll maybe even future like the 
ability to read minds,

2720
02:21:14,371 --> 02:21:16,260
to read thoughts to read,
look,

2721
02:21:16,330 --> 02:21:17,610
fff,
mri,

2722
02:21:17,680 --> 02:21:20,370
[inaudible],
although it's been widely criticized,

2723
02:21:20,400 --> 02:21:24,000
has been used to convict people of 
crimes in India.

2724
02:21:24,030 --> 02:21:29,030
There's a woman who was convicted of 
murder because she had what they 

2725
02:21:29,030 --> 02:21:33,500
describe as functional knowledge of a 
crime scene and this has been widely 

2726
02:21:33,631 --> 02:21:37,560
discredited and it's very controversial.
I don't know.

2727
02:21:37,680 --> 02:21:42,680
I don't know the whole story,
but it was for a television show that I 

2728
02:21:42,680 --> 02:21:44,751
was doing for saifai.
We interviewed a neurologist or a 

2729
02:21:45,121 --> 02:21:50,121
neuroscientist and she was describing 
how this in in our country will never 

2730
02:21:51,481 --> 02:21:56,481
work,
but in these other countries where the 

2731
02:21:56,481 --> 02:22:00,171
maybe they don't have as much of as much
of an understanding or they were able to

2732
02:22:00,511 --> 02:22:05,511
manipulate their courts into thinking 
that this was far more definitive and 

2733
02:22:05,611 --> 02:22:06,660
conclusive than it really is.

2734
02:22:07,200 --> 02:22:11,070
But the point being that this is just 
the tip of the iceberg,

2735
02:22:11,071 --> 02:22:16,071
right?
And if they continue to get better at 

2736
02:22:16,071 --> 02:22:18,620
this,
and if this human technological 

2737
02:22:18,620 --> 02:22:23,301
symbiotic relationship takes place to 
the point where we essentially are our 

2738
02:22:24,140 --> 02:22:26,430
memories,
especially there pretty piss poor,

2739
02:22:26,820 --> 02:22:31,820
but if we can turn our memories into 
some digital archive that you can 

2740
02:22:31,820 --> 02:22:31,820
access,
it will.

2741
02:22:31,820 --> 02:22:36,530
Then we're going to know I've got an I'm
going to look into your head and I'm 

2742
02:22:36,530 --> 02:22:38,340
going to know what's going on and to be 
able to tap into it and we will.

2743
02:22:38,410 --> 02:22:43,410
We'll be connected the same way we were 
connected with wifi the same way our 

2744
02:22:43,410 --> 02:22:44,430
cell phones are connected through the 
cellular network.

2745
02:22:44,610 --> 02:22:48,240
They'll be some sort of a network of 
information exchange between all people.

2746
02:22:48,241 --> 02:22:51,450
And if that's the case,
deception will be almost impossible.

2747
02:22:51,780 --> 02:22:55,500
Motivations would be crystal clear and 
you're going to know who's full of shit.

2748
02:22:55,700 --> 02:23:00,700
That's going to be a fucking bad day for
a lot of idiots out there because a lot 

2749
02:23:00,700 --> 02:23:03,650
of assholes out there that have been 
leading along idiots and the they,

2750
02:23:03,660 --> 02:23:05,340
they believe in these people.
You know,

2751
02:23:05,360 --> 02:23:07,230
whether these cult members or whatever

2752
02:23:07,270 --> 02:23:12,270
you remember in kubrick's film,
2001 in the beginning when there's the 

2753
02:23:13,050 --> 02:23:14,460
pre,
the monkeys,

2754
02:23:14,461 --> 02:23:19,170
the monkeys model and they're sitting at
dawn and they're sitting in this kind of

2755
02:23:19,171 --> 02:23:21,900
cliff area and they're looking at each 
other,

2756
02:23:21,901 --> 02:23:23,760
right?
They're looking at each other.

2757
02:23:23,910 --> 02:23:28,910
I never forgot that scene because it's 
the scene before they get attacked by 

2758
02:23:28,910 --> 02:23:32,571
that other group that comes in,
but they're looking at each other and 

2759
02:23:32,571 --> 02:23:32,571
their nonverbal.
RighT.

2760
02:23:32,571 --> 02:23:36,891
They're not communicating.
They don't have to do lists and emails 

2761
02:23:36,891 --> 02:23:37,150
and shit going on.
They're just there.

2762
02:23:37,750 --> 02:23:42,750
And to me like kubrick was trying to 
show that they are in a group 

2763
02:23:42,750 --> 02:23:46,190
intelligence that just by eye gaze they 
could tell what the state is and then 

2764
02:23:47,191 --> 02:23:52,191
the share that state.
Because if somebody in such an intense 

2765
02:23:52,191 --> 02:23:54,390
environment,
I mean if you have nefarious purposes or

2766
02:23:54,750 --> 02:23:57,780
you know you're going to look away and 
you're going to have that whole thing.

2767
02:23:58,020 --> 02:24:02,460
so maybe that's the way we were before 
we came into mind.

2768
02:24:02,490 --> 02:24:06,570
Before all this stuff came in 
civilization mind to do lists,

2769
02:24:06,571 --> 02:24:08,250
hierarchies and whatnot.
We were.

2770
02:24:09,030 --> 02:24:12,270
There was no way for us like we're way 
we're looking now at each other.

2771
02:24:12,271 --> 02:24:13,500
We're really connected.

2772
02:24:13,660 --> 02:24:18,660
Maybe the valleys of perceptions may be 
the pre communicative apes where they 

2773
02:24:20,621 --> 02:24:23,680
didn't have verbal communication or 
language or anything.

2774
02:24:23,890 --> 02:24:28,890
Maybe they had this sort of intuitive 
sense of each other and then that was 

2775
02:24:28,890 --> 02:24:31,891
all lost with email and twitter and 
ended up coming back with some new 

2776
02:24:31,891 --> 02:24:34,180
technology that takes it to a far deeper
level.

2777
02:24:34,190 --> 02:24:34,430
And

2778
02:24:34,460 --> 02:24:36,620
what I think,
and this is my theory,

2779
02:24:36,621 --> 02:24:39,020
is that a louis.
Yeah,

2780
02:24:39,350 --> 02:24:41,040
we were warning,
you know,

2781
02:24:41,290 --> 02:24:46,290
it looses by packing those thousand 
initiates and two that buried temple and

2782
02:24:46,701 --> 02:24:49,460
subjecting them to sound and music and 
you know,

2783
02:24:49,750 --> 02:24:52,700
some kind of sounds like a rave.
It was like intense,

2784
02:24:52,910 --> 02:24:55,550
but these people were fashioned.
they were fat.

2785
02:24:55,551 --> 02:24:59,930
They were fashioned into new beings from
in that experience wasn't,

2786
02:24:59,960 --> 02:25:02,900
couldn't it have been a group mind fast 
and couldn't have been,

2787
02:25:03,410 --> 02:25:05,390
you know,
returning that.

2788
02:25:05,630 --> 02:25:08,030
And when we siT in medicine circles 
today,

2789
02:25:08,340 --> 02:25:13,330
when we do jujitsu,
when we do a group yoga,

2790
02:25:13,370 --> 02:25:18,370
intense things are intense ordeal.
Things that people are seeking out now 

2791
02:25:18,370 --> 02:25:21,440
for deep connection to remove isolation 
from other people.

2792
02:25:21,710 --> 02:25:26,710
Meditation's all these practices are 
this yearning to get back to where we 

2793
02:25:26,710 --> 02:25:28,030
were,
you know,

2794
02:25:28,460 --> 02:25:32,770
you didn't feel isolated from others and
that we had her in a group mind and that

2795
02:25:32,940 --> 02:25:37,940
that's the future of evolution of our 
communities and we may need the shaman 

2796
02:25:37,940 --> 02:25:38,050
to come around,
you know,

2797
02:25:38,051 --> 02:25:40,040
in the upper paleolithic,
you know,

2798
02:25:40,230 --> 02:25:41,740
those communities were pretty helpful.

2799
02:25:41,770 --> 02:25:43,630
That waS a pretty functional world.
I mean,

2800
02:25:43,920 --> 02:25:45,730
you know,
coming into,

2801
02:25:45,760 --> 02:25:50,760
you know,
the karnak and the stone hands and the 

2802
02:25:50,760 --> 02:25:53,071
lay lines and be incredible world of 
even celtic europe was incredibly 

2803
02:25:53,071 --> 02:25:57,661
together.
There was killed at europe is like the 

2804
02:25:57,661 --> 02:26:00,031
european union now.
Celtic europe had medical practices and 

2805
02:26:00,031 --> 02:26:04,021
common laws and the druids could come in
if there was a battle about to occur 

2806
02:26:05,231 --> 02:26:10,231
between celtic people's.
The druids had the power to walk down 

2807
02:26:10,231 --> 02:26:14,101
that line and decide whether the battle 
should happen or not because there was 

2808
02:26:14,101 --> 02:26:14,101
an authority.
There was.

2809
02:26:14,101 --> 02:26:18,930
So this whole idea of the civilization 
of the european union after 2000 years 

2810
02:26:19,871 --> 02:26:23,350
of roman interest to seen war,
barbarian warfare,

2811
02:26:23,351 --> 02:26:27,340
christian religious and whatnot,
as they've returned to the celtic model,

2812
02:26:27,341 --> 02:26:32,341
they've returned in sense the upper 
paleolithic model of civilization of of 

2813
02:26:33,011 --> 02:26:38,011
civil societies and not beating each 
other in and in doing and of common 

2814
02:26:38,171 --> 02:26:39,310
currency,
common exchange,

2815
02:26:39,311 --> 02:26:44,311
common health comm.
So maybe that is coming back that is 

2816
02:26:44,311 --> 02:26:47,080
returning and we're,
we're shutting off the culture that came

2817
02:26:47,081 --> 02:26:48,390
and destroyed illusion looses.

2818
02:26:48,590 --> 02:26:53,590
Well,
I think there's definitely a feeling 

2819
02:26:53,590 --> 02:26:53,590
amongst a lot of folks that the standard
model,

2820
02:26:53,680 --> 02:26:58,510
the cubicle life retirement at 65 is not
just unappealing,

2821
02:26:58,780 --> 02:27:00,890
not just unrewarding,
it's surf,

2822
02:27:01,740 --> 02:27:06,740
surf model slavery.
It's a form of slavery that's voluntary 

2823
02:27:06,740 --> 02:27:06,740
mean you,
you're,

2824
02:27:06,740 --> 02:27:08,140
you're,
you're connecting to a machine.

2825
02:27:08,290 --> 02:27:10,990
You're giving your body literally.
You're giving your health,

2826
02:27:11,140 --> 02:27:13,320
you're giving your spinal fluid,
ears,

2827
02:27:13,360 --> 02:27:16,630
soul.
Your creative creativity are very.

2828
02:27:17,260 --> 02:27:22,260
Your body literally is like giving into 
your chair and your back is being 

2829
02:27:22,260 --> 02:27:24,580
compressed and your discs are bulging.
Your feet are going numb,

2830
02:27:24,581 --> 02:27:29,581
and I mean your,
your body is being sucked down into 

2831
02:27:29,581 --> 02:27:32,810
this.
Your mind is turned into a stimulus 

2832
02:27:32,810 --> 02:27:35,410
response pieces of jello and I think 
that's what a lot of this yoga,

2833
02:27:35,411 --> 02:27:40,411
this,
this renaissance of meditation that a 

2834
02:27:40,411 --> 02:27:41,020
lot of people are experiencing,
especially yoga.

2835
02:27:41,470 --> 02:27:44,040
Yoga was never this popular when I was 
right.

2836
02:27:44,270 --> 02:27:49,270
it's incredibly popular now and as the 
rise of technological connection,

2837
02:27:50,020 --> 02:27:55,020
electronic connections with each other 
has also facilitated the rise of like 

2838
02:27:55,020 --> 02:27:59,970
and you know,
fit these people wanting to do things 

2839
02:27:59,970 --> 02:27:59,970
that are physical,
physical.

2840
02:27:59,970 --> 02:28:03,590
I.
On friday I did a pretty long float and 

2841
02:28:03,590 --> 02:28:06,890
we go.
By the way they've offered you a free 

2842
02:28:06,890 --> 02:28:08,110
float if you come up to the santa cruz 
mountains are friends.

2843
02:28:08,320 --> 02:28:10,000
that sounds like a long trip for a 
float.

2844
02:28:10,001 --> 02:28:14,330
I got one in my basement.
This is a beautiful flotation.

2845
02:28:14,420 --> 02:28:17,170
It's the name of the company.
Cloud nine.

2846
02:28:17,190 --> 02:28:17,590
Oh,
okay.

2847
02:28:17,591 --> 02:28:18,520
I've heard of them.
Yeah,

2848
02:28:18,540 --> 02:28:22,240
because jim shaunti and they was 
fascinating

2849
02:28:22,280 --> 02:28:25,070
property and I went there for a float 
and I tell you,

2850
02:28:25,520 --> 02:28:26,720
you know,
it's,

2851
02:28:26,970 --> 02:28:30,290
it's incredible because it's,
it's like doing,

2852
02:28:30,540 --> 02:28:35,540
you know,
a psychedelic in that or doing deep 

2853
02:28:35,540 --> 02:28:38,840
meditation or doing.
But the flotation tank is I think better

2854
02:28:38,870 --> 02:28:43,870
because I process all my brain shit,
like for the first hour or something in 

2855
02:28:44,661 --> 02:28:49,661
this probably happens to you.
It just grind through and it's like I'm 

2856
02:28:49,661 --> 02:28:53,380
having these repeated thoughts of my 
mind or my ego is grinding through and 

2857
02:28:53,380 --> 02:28:57,690
through and finally it quiets fine when 
it's quiet and I don't have stimulus on 

2858
02:28:57,690 --> 02:29:02,411
my body because I'm in a flotation tank 
and I maybe have my head held up or 

2859
02:29:02,411 --> 02:29:05,690
whatever and I start not knowing my body
where it is and I'm free,

2860
02:29:05,691 --> 02:29:10,691
I'm liberated,
and then the I can do the deep work at 

2861
02:29:10,691 --> 02:29:11,510
my god.
I mean the next day,

2862
02:29:11,570 --> 02:29:16,570
this is why I was able to finish this to
scientific papers because I floated and 

2863
02:29:16,700 --> 02:29:21,700
I lost all that 2000 years of refer me.
It was months and months of being in my 

2864
02:29:22,551 --> 02:29:23,840
head.
I mean,

2865
02:29:23,841 --> 02:29:24,140
I,
I.

2866
02:29:24,141 --> 02:29:25,310
It's such a powerful,
powerful

2867
02:29:25,350 --> 02:29:30,350
tool.
It's an amazing tool and it's really 

2868
02:29:30,350 --> 02:29:32,271
bizarre to me that this was something 
that was kind of forgotten for a long 

2869
02:29:32,271 --> 02:29:35,301
time.
I didn't understand when I first 

2870
02:29:35,301 --> 02:29:37,641
discovered the tank when I first saw it 
in altered states when I was in high 

2871
02:29:37,641 --> 02:29:37,700
school.
That,

2872
02:29:37,730 --> 02:29:42,730
uh,
amazing movie with William Murray where 

2873
02:29:42,730 --> 02:29:45,000
he turns into drink.
Iowasca became some freak animal.

2874
02:29:46,350 --> 02:29:49,890
Crazy movie really does not hold up.
Don't watch it again.

2875
02:29:50,400 --> 02:29:52,800
We'll try to watch in 2004.
It's a piece of shit.

2876
02:29:52,830 --> 02:29:53,820
Oh,
it's so bad.

2877
02:29:54,120 --> 02:29:55,500
It's so bad.
Like people have watched.

2878
02:29:55,501 --> 02:29:57,780
It laughed at me like,
you fucking like this movie.

2879
02:29:58,010 --> 02:30:00,180
My brow is 14.
Okay.

2880
02:30:00,390 --> 02:30:05,390
So long time ago.
but point is I didn't experience it 

2881
02:30:05,390 --> 02:30:07,260
until 2002.
And when I first did it,

2882
02:30:08,130 --> 02:30:10,290
others plays in burbank called soothing 
solutions.

2883
02:30:10,291 --> 02:30:11,100
I was placed.
Where did it.

2884
02:30:11,310 --> 02:30:16,310
The first time I did I wanted to do it 
forever and I found a place that had it 

2885
02:30:16,310 --> 02:30:18,720
and I was like,
how is this not popular?

2886
02:30:18,990 --> 02:30:20,310
And then when I started talking about 
it,

2887
02:30:20,311 --> 02:30:20,940
everybody's like,
wow,

2888
02:30:20,941 --> 02:30:25,941
you're always talking about this thing.
Like you're the guy who talks about the 

2889
02:30:25,941 --> 02:30:25,941
tank.
I'm like,

2890
02:30:25,941 --> 02:30:26,970
how are you hearing about this from a 
goddamn comedian?

2891
02:30:27,330 --> 02:30:28,390
Like,
how is this not the.

2892
02:30:28,440 --> 02:30:33,440
How's the president not on television 
and saying we need to create a more 

2893
02:30:33,440 --> 02:30:35,820
introspective commerce society and one 
of the things we're going to do is we're

2894
02:30:35,821 --> 02:30:38,370
going to wheel out isolation tanks all 
over the nation.

2895
02:30:39,910 --> 02:30:42,480
There will be a beautiful thing to bring
them up to some high schools,

2896
02:30:42,630 --> 02:30:44,310
community centers,
universities.

2897
02:30:44,640 --> 02:30:49,640
This will accelerate thinking.
It's one of the best tools for personal 

2898
02:30:49,640 --> 02:30:53,961
evolution I've ever experienced for 
actually the exact same thing as you 

2899
02:30:53,961 --> 02:30:58,041
said.
For me it's the first x amount of 

2900
02:30:58,041 --> 02:30:58,041
minutes is all just going over my own 
bullshit,

2901
02:30:58,041 --> 02:31:02,750
but slowly but surely because I do it so
often I've gotten quicker with that and 

2902
02:31:02,750 --> 02:31:06,150
it's gotten down to like 20 minutes,
but it's just I get in there and I go,

2903
02:31:06,151 --> 02:31:11,151
here we go.
I've got to go through all this stupid 

2904
02:31:11,151 --> 02:31:11,151
shit.
Clean all this out.

2905
02:31:11,151 --> 02:31:12,770
But perspective enhancing like,
you know,

2906
02:31:12,771 --> 02:31:17,771
like no matter how hectic and weird my 
life is when I get into that thing and 

2907
02:31:18,181 --> 02:31:18,990
then I get out,
I'm like,

2908
02:31:19,160 --> 02:31:19,930
that's all right.

2909
02:31:20,440 --> 02:31:22,240
Yeah.
You're like,

2910
02:31:22,270 --> 02:31:25,950
I'm the best hippie of the 66.
It's beautiful.

2911
02:31:26,060 --> 02:31:31,060
It's so important for me because I'm 
always juggling like five different 

2912
02:31:31,060 --> 02:31:31,060
jobs.
Yeah,

2913
02:31:31,060 --> 02:31:32,400
a million things to.
And you know,

2914
02:31:32,401 --> 02:31:37,401
my back,
I put my fricking back out so I go into 

2915
02:31:37,401 --> 02:31:38,490
float and it's like the first hour it's 
just so painful.

2916
02:31:38,491 --> 02:31:43,491
It's like slowly like separates and it's
like I barely do this and then barely 

2917
02:31:45,931 --> 02:31:48,170
put my.
Put my hands down and then then I say,

2918
02:31:48,210 --> 02:31:53,210
wait a minute,
my body can take any position so I let 

2919
02:31:53,210 --> 02:31:57,021
my body tickets own position.
It moves itself around until I'm not in 

2920
02:31:57,021 --> 02:32:01,221
pain anymore.
And then by the time I got out the pain 

2921
02:32:02,101 --> 02:32:04,360
was down like 80 percent.
Yeah.

2922
02:32:04,370 --> 02:32:07,680
it's,
it is an unbelievable tool and it's just

2923
02:32:07,681 --> 02:32:11,070
weird to me how uncommon it is as 
terrence's.

2924
02:32:11,150 --> 02:32:13,660
How do they keep the lid on this stuff?
Don't.

2925
02:32:14,210 --> 02:32:15,800
The other thing that terrence says,
the man,

2926
02:32:15,980 --> 02:32:18,320
sometimes people do the man's work for 
the man,

2927
02:32:18,380 --> 02:32:21,650
like no one's putting,
keeping the lid on isolation tanks.

2928
02:32:21,651 --> 02:32:24,650
It's just no one tAlked about it for 
whatever reason.

2929
02:32:24,651 --> 02:32:28,670
It's just life is tough.
People have mortgages,

2930
02:32:28,930 --> 02:32:33,930
they have student loans.
There's a lot of work that has to be 

2931
02:32:33,930 --> 02:32:34,530
done.
The lawn has to be mowed.

2932
02:32:35,140 --> 02:32:37,280
Got to raise your kids a lot of shit 
going on.

2933
02:32:37,281 --> 02:32:41,480
It's hard to servitude jail.
We were talking before the podcast about

2934
02:32:41,481 --> 02:32:44,180
chairs.
It's weird chair that I have this saddle

2935
02:32:44,181 --> 02:32:47,300
chair.
Do you use an ergonomic chair when you,

2936
02:32:47,301 --> 02:32:48,560
uh,
when you do your writing,

2937
02:32:48,680 --> 02:32:49,400
you know,
I,

2938
02:32:49,790 --> 02:32:53,950
my neighbor and I made this chair.
We took this body built chair from.

2939
02:32:53,960 --> 02:32:57,110
There's a plug for you from Texas that's
used by surgeons,

2940
02:32:57,111 --> 02:32:59,240
by brain surgeons.
It tilts forward.

2941
02:32:59,241 --> 02:33:04,241
It has incredible support and we made an
extension arm that holds the keyboard of

2942
02:33:04,310 --> 02:33:09,310
my lap and the mouse exactly in the 
right place just right where your arms 

2943
02:33:09,310 --> 02:33:10,040
hang,
hang,

2944
02:33:10,070 --> 02:33:12,020
and then I can roll back from the 
screens.

2945
02:33:12,021 --> 02:33:17,021
I'm much farther from the screen so I 
don't get that myopic kind of early 

2946
02:33:17,021 --> 02:33:17,930
visit and vision loss.
That's me.

2947
02:33:18,020 --> 02:33:19,320
I got that chair.
Yeah.

2948
02:33:19,770 --> 02:33:21,800
So I've been using that chair for 20 
years,

2949
02:33:21,980 --> 02:33:26,980
but now what I'm finding unfortunately,
just even reaching for the mouse as 

2950
02:33:26,980 --> 02:33:28,910
creating repetitive strain injury for 
me,

2951
02:33:29,090 --> 02:33:33,560
even going to get one of them helmets or
move around your eyes.

2952
02:33:33,620 --> 02:33:38,620
Unfortunately I'm back on a laptop where
I don't have to do any motion until my 

2953
02:33:38,620 --> 02:33:38,750
friend told me.

2954
02:33:38,750 --> 02:33:39,890
He said,
you're an idiot.

2955
02:33:40,130 --> 02:33:41,720
You know,
I have a friends of the hassle.

2956
02:33:41,790 --> 02:33:43,430
You know,
right away you're an idiot.

2957
02:33:43,540 --> 02:33:45,020
I'm an idiot.
He's an asshole.

2958
02:33:45,320 --> 02:33:47,870
But I have my own podcast called the 
levity zone.

2959
02:33:47,871 --> 02:33:49,430
And I do lots of editing.
You know,

2960
02:33:49,431 --> 02:33:50,990
I know that you could just go straight 
out,

2961
02:33:50,991 --> 02:33:52,380
but I'm like a craftsman.
I,

2962
02:33:52,400 --> 02:33:55,210
we have different musicians in each 
episode for the levity,

2963
02:33:55,211 --> 02:33:57,030
sound liberties on.org.
Um,

2964
02:33:57,110 --> 02:33:59,780
say that again.
Levity zone.org.

2965
02:34:00,020 --> 02:34:02,960
[inaudible] dot org.
It's the world needs more.

2966
02:34:03,050 --> 02:34:08,050
We have plenty of novelty.
We need more at t l e v I t y zone.

2967
02:34:08,630 --> 02:34:13,630
So you're in the zone when you're 
listening to these shows at [inaudible] 

2968
02:34:13,630 --> 02:34:16,100
dot org.
And so I do tons of editing and he said,

2969
02:34:16,101 --> 02:34:21,101
you fool,
you need to get a kensington track ball 

2970
02:34:21,101 --> 02:34:21,730
so you're just moving your thumb,
not your arm.

2971
02:34:22,300 --> 02:34:25,120
All editors are using track balls for 
buttons.

2972
02:34:25,120 --> 02:34:27,680
And I finally got religion and I'm 
finally not using a mouse.

2973
02:34:27,700 --> 02:34:29,100
Mac has a,
uh,

2974
02:34:29,140 --> 02:34:31,930
they have like a key,
like this track pad.

2975
02:34:32,020 --> 02:34:33,460
Yeah.
It's a larger version of it.

2976
02:34:33,461 --> 02:34:34,710
That's what I use.
It's amazing.

2977
02:34:34,711 --> 02:34:39,670
I used to move the tracks back and 
forward and then I use the other hand on

2978
02:34:39,671 --> 02:34:41,230
the kensington to go cut,
paste,

2979
02:34:41,231 --> 02:34:41,660
cut,
paste.

2980
02:34:42,150 --> 02:34:43,790
Okay.
You're doing great.

2981
02:34:43,870 --> 02:34:44,650
Yeah,
totally.

2982
02:34:44,651 --> 02:34:45,760
Great.
Yeah.

2983
02:34:45,820 --> 02:34:50,820
Well you also have probably have 
keystrokes preprogrammed on that thing 

2984
02:34:50,820 --> 02:34:50,820
and the buttons.
Yeah.

2985
02:34:50,820 --> 02:34:52,000
That helps cut.
Copy paste.

2986
02:34:52,010 --> 02:34:55,930
Mark's like no collected.
I love the track pad.

2987
02:34:55,931 --> 02:34:57,560
Once I switched to it on a,
um,

2988
02:34:57,830 --> 02:35:02,830
on a home computer or on an imac,
I would never go back to the house 

2989
02:35:02,830 --> 02:35:04,660
except for gaming.
But I can't it either way.

2990
02:35:05,380 --> 02:35:09,970
The digi barn museum,
we got a new artifact.

2991
02:35:10,450 --> 02:35:13,690
Doug angle parts mouse,
you know doug engelbart,

2992
02:35:13,950 --> 02:35:14,900
he and building that.

2993
02:35:14,900 --> 02:35:19,900
She created the mouse and the first 
online system in the mid sixties and 

2994
02:35:19,900 --> 02:35:23,641
they dug,
had something called the mother of all 

2995
02:35:23,641 --> 02:35:23,641
demos which happened on December 9th,
19,

2996
02:35:23,641 --> 02:35:27,160
68 and it totally revolutionized what 
computing was going to be.

2997
02:35:27,161 --> 02:35:32,161
He was like in this hall in san 
francisco using a mouse and the cursor 

2998
02:35:32,161 --> 02:35:36,170
was going on the screen is opening 
windows and clicking the first graphic 

2999
02:35:36,170 --> 02:35:40,621
user interface with 68 house and I don't
have that one,

3000
02:35:40,991 --> 02:35:45,280
but I've got a.
If you look up mother of all demos,

3001
02:35:46,540 --> 02:35:51,160
you'll see the one that came into the 
dog barn looks exactly like the one that

3002
02:35:51,161 --> 02:35:56,161
doug is using the demo now.
There were several of them made so we 

3003
02:35:56,161 --> 02:35:59,731
don't know,
but this has the round buttons as a 

3004
02:35:59,731 --> 02:36:01,960
great big case on it and a key set.
So the see he had.

3005
02:36:01,990 --> 02:36:03,550
He didn't have to go to the keyboard.

3006
02:36:03,550 --> 02:36:05,440
He had this,
this court keyboard.

3007
02:36:05,540 --> 02:36:06,610
I'll that.
Yeah,

3008
02:36:06,611 --> 02:36:07,180
there,
there,

3009
02:36:07,181 --> 02:36:09,310
there,
there are three buttons mean well,

3010
02:36:09,400 --> 02:36:14,400
apple had one button actually that deep 
into the two thousands probably from my 

3011
02:36:14,400 --> 02:36:18,991
collection,
but that's an alto mouse from the 

3012
02:36:18,991 --> 02:36:20,470
seventies.
If look at sandy's,

3013
02:36:20,500 --> 02:36:23,980
yeah,
do tug to mother of all demos and you'll

3014
02:36:23,981 --> 02:36:25,270
probably find the,
uh,

3015
02:36:25,630 --> 02:36:30,630
the video of it.
Is it true that xerox created the user 

3016
02:36:30,630 --> 02:36:34,140
interface in the apple copied xerox and 
then ultimately microsoft copies apple?

3017
02:36:34,180 --> 02:36:39,180
It wAs,
it was kind of passed from one to the 

3018
02:36:39,180 --> 02:36:39,180
other.
So for example,

3019
02:36:39,180 --> 02:36:43,430
uh,
a say sri stanford research institute 

3020
02:36:43,430 --> 02:36:44,560
did this,
doug engelbart nls,

3021
02:36:44,590 --> 02:36:46,840
fantastic demo and everybody watched it 
and go,

3022
02:36:46,841 --> 02:36:51,841
oh my god,
this totally changed computing into a 

3023
02:36:51,841 --> 02:36:53,320
human thing rather than data processing 
and batch.

3024
02:36:53,321 --> 02:36:55,180
And you know,
it became no,

3025
02:36:55,190 --> 02:36:57,070
it's visual.
We're visual.

3026
02:36:57,340 --> 02:37:00,480
This is a tool for our minds.
It's a tool for this.

3027
02:37:00,780 --> 02:37:02,450
This is it.
An hour and a half long though.

3028
02:37:02,451 --> 02:37:05,530
So yeah,
scroll around and you can see doug,

3029
02:37:05,920 --> 02:37:07,740
you can see doug other areas.
wow.

3030
02:37:07,890 --> 02:37:11,080
You see that thing on the right?
See that in 68,

3031
02:37:11,120 --> 02:37:12,490
68.
So look at that.

3032
02:37:12,910 --> 02:37:16,010
That looks exactly like the mouse.
It's at the barn right now.

3033
02:37:16,100 --> 02:37:19,730
That's remarkably similar to what a lot 
of people use.

3034
02:37:19,850 --> 02:37:24,010
Then look at the keyboard and I think 
steelcase or somebody did that thing and

3035
02:37:24,011 --> 02:37:29,011
the key set allows you to court key 
movements like accelerated things and 

3036
02:37:30,151 --> 02:37:35,151
then on screen he has clickable text.
He's got a video window that a guy 

3037
02:37:35,531 --> 02:37:40,330
appears from sri transmitted live video.
Look at this.

3038
02:37:40,331 --> 02:37:41,330
Look at this.
That's him.

3039
02:37:41,530 --> 02:37:43,750
Yeah.
That's one of the engineers at sri.

3040
02:37:43,910 --> 02:37:46,430
So he's got live video on a screen.
Yeah,

3041
02:37:48,050 --> 02:37:50,750
this is 68 and 68.
He is live video.

3042
02:37:51,030 --> 02:37:56,030
Yeah,
and this is beamed in a big auditorium 

3043
02:37:56,030 --> 02:37:56,770
in san francisco at a conference and 
everybody in the audience is going,

3044
02:37:57,130 --> 02:37:59,200
oh my god,
this is computing.

3045
02:37:59,201 --> 02:38:04,201
This is,
this is interacting with people and so 

3046
02:38:04,201 --> 02:38:04,570
he's clicking see the cursor.
You can just sort of barely see it.

3047
02:38:04,571 --> 02:38:06,940
He's moving around,
he's clicking on things,

3048
02:38:06,941 --> 02:38:11,941
they're pulling up data,
they're doing searches and that's a 

3049
02:38:11,941 --> 02:38:12,700
recipe lists and so everybody looked at 
this and said,

3050
02:38:13,360 --> 02:38:18,360
oh my god.
And so xerox palo alto research center 

3051
02:38:18,360 --> 02:38:21,690
kind of had a bunch of people from 
doug's group and then they built the 

3052
02:38:21,690 --> 02:38:25,441
first network,
personal computer or the ether net and 

3053
02:38:25,441 --> 02:38:25,441
all that stuff.
In the seventies,

3054
02:38:25,441 --> 02:38:25,580
and you're right,
you know,

3055
02:38:25,700 --> 02:38:29,530
in walks steve jobs and in the croup and
they kind of went,

3056
02:38:29,590 --> 02:38:31,450
oh my god,
that's the future of computing,

3057
02:38:31,451 --> 02:38:35,800
and they created the lisa and the 
macintosh and bill gates and the company

3058
02:38:35,830 --> 02:38:40,830
looked at the xerox star and altona and 
gerald pneumonia who was at park,

3059
02:38:41,260 --> 02:38:46,260
came to microsoft and created microsoft 
word based on him creating the first 

3060
02:38:46,260 --> 02:38:49,720
word processor at park and then made a 
billion dollars.

3061
02:38:49,721 --> 02:38:50,410
Right.
And everything.

3062
02:38:50,411 --> 02:38:55,411
But no,
I mean xerox really did invent the 

3063
02:38:55,411 --> 02:38:56,050
future under bob taylor's leadership in 
the seventies.

3064
02:38:56,051 --> 02:38:57,570
They just created the future.
Right.

3065
02:38:57,610 --> 02:39:00,100
How did they drop the ball and go to 
copy machines?

3066
02:39:00,310 --> 02:39:00,890
Well,
you know,

3067
02:39:00,891 --> 02:39:05,891
it was such a company full of copier 
heads and understand what they were 

3068
02:39:05,891 --> 02:39:09,511
looking at it and walked out the door,
But dolby came out of that and everybody

3069
02:39:10,181 --> 02:39:12,310
in ibm in the 19,
whatever it was,

3070
02:39:12,311 --> 02:39:15,990
when they said no one's gonna want a 
computer in their house.

3071
02:39:16,500 --> 02:39:17,650
Yeah,
the fuck up.

3072
02:39:18,280 --> 02:39:21,820
It was like the biggest bad call ever.
Right?

3073
02:39:21,821 --> 02:39:26,821
I mean,
there were all these predictions that 

3074
02:39:26,821 --> 02:39:26,821
completely ridiculous.
Ridiculous.

3075
02:39:26,821 --> 02:39:27,690
In retrospect,
in retrospect,

3076
02:39:27,720 --> 02:39:28,480
how could anybody.
No,

3077
02:39:28,481 --> 02:39:29,890
that's.
Isn't that always the point?

3078
02:39:30,130 --> 02:39:32,290
Is that like,
like we were talking about,

3079
02:39:32,291 --> 02:39:35,020
you can't predict a 2012 or 20,
45,

3080
02:39:35,021 --> 02:39:37,360
you're just not going to not going.
No one's gonna see it.

3081
02:39:37,900 --> 02:39:41,590
I am going to have some ideas,
but the ultimately the thing itself,

3082
02:39:41,830 --> 02:39:46,830
like no one ever thought the internet 
was going to be facebook or message 

3083
02:39:49,001 --> 02:39:51,460
boards or you know,
twitter,

3084
02:39:51,730 --> 02:39:55,180
social media interaction.
The way we we experienced today.

3085
02:39:55,450 --> 02:40:00,450
It's so unbelievably bizarre.
this connection that we have to each 

3086
02:40:00,450 --> 02:40:01,770
other.
It's so intense and,

3087
02:40:01,870 --> 02:40:03,640
and,
and no one saw it coming.

3088
02:40:03,660 --> 02:40:04,420
Like for instance,

3089
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:07,430
just yesterday morning I got up into 
holy shit,

3090
02:40:07,980 --> 02:40:12,980
I'm going to be on joe rogan.
I'm going to just at least post your 

3091
02:40:12,980 --> 02:40:16,120
beautiful red face logo,
my facebook page and put it on a bunch 

3092
02:40:16,120 --> 02:40:19,560
of groups because available on a mug.
So I just put this up.

3093
02:40:20,190 --> 02:40:23,220
I put this up just on facebook.
I only got three or 4,000

3094
02:40:23,280 --> 02:40:24,810
followers,
but this thing just went bing,

3095
02:40:24,811 --> 02:40:25,260
bing,
bing,

3096
02:40:25,261 --> 02:40:25,710
bing,
bang.

3097
02:40:25,711 --> 02:40:26,820
And people,
you know,

3098
02:40:26,910 --> 02:40:29,910
there's probably a ton of listeners that
there wouldn't have been just because of

3099
02:40:29,911 --> 02:40:30,680
one little thing.

3100
02:40:31,570 --> 02:40:32,370
Yeah,
I'm sure.

3101
02:40:33,150 --> 02:40:34,170
I'm sure.
Well,

3102
02:40:34,171 --> 02:40:39,171
it's one of those things too that I love
the fact that someone could listen to 

3103
02:40:40,111 --> 02:40:41,190
this and go,
hey,

3104
02:40:41,191 --> 02:40:43,770
you know,
bruce damer is on this podcast.

3105
02:40:44,040 --> 02:40:46,290
you got to check this out,
here's a link.

3106
02:40:46,470 --> 02:40:47,720
And then boom,
boom,

3107
02:40:48,150 --> 02:40:50,910
boom.
And then someone retweets it and it gets

3108
02:40:50,911 --> 02:40:55,911
retweeted a thousand times and sent to 
facebook and someone sends in an email 

3109
02:40:55,911 --> 02:40:55,911
and

3110
02:40:56,820 --> 02:41:00,130
it's like,
we're back.

3111
02:41:00,430 --> 02:41:03,250
We're back in that little group of 2000,
one eight,

3112
02:41:03,970 --> 02:41:05,800
looking at each other.
But what we're looking,

3113
02:41:06,050 --> 02:41:10,370
we're spending for sending the whole of 
our culture and technology in each gaze.

3114
02:41:10,960 --> 02:41:12,270
It's amazing.
I mean,

3115
02:41:12,520 --> 02:41:17,520
if you could be some kind of super being
unwatched the mind of humanity from 

3116
02:41:17,520 --> 02:41:22,220
orbit and study it as a thing that's 
coming alive and it's moving.

3117
02:41:22,480 --> 02:41:24,380
It's getting connected,
uh,

3118
02:41:24,381 --> 02:41:27,610
maynard to be better than any trip 
experience.

3119
02:41:27,611 --> 02:41:29,260
I mean,
just in truth,

3120
02:41:29,261 --> 02:41:34,261
you know,
I look up at the night sky or doing the 

3121
02:41:34,261 --> 02:41:36,361
work in origin of life.
I'm looking at molecular streams and 

3122
02:41:36,361 --> 02:41:39,211
looking through microscopes on liquid 
chemistry and I was like this most 

3123
02:41:39,211 --> 02:41:42,390
amazing universe of just lipids moving 
around on a slide and then look at the 

3124
02:41:42,851 --> 02:41:46,330
internet.
This is the greatest time in the history

3125
02:41:46,331 --> 02:41:48,100
of and,
and you know,

3126
02:41:48,520 --> 02:41:50,830
the people talk about rare earths,
you know,

3127
02:41:50,831 --> 02:41:53,380
how rare is,
are we,

3128
02:41:53,381 --> 02:41:54,850
you know,
the drake equation,

3129
02:41:54,851 --> 02:41:58,750
which shows solar systems that have 
planets in the planet that have been the

3130
02:41:58,751 --> 02:42:02,320
right habitable zone and the develop 
intelligent life.

3131
02:42:02,321 --> 02:42:07,300
And we had just the right end asteroid 
impacts to come in and spin the disk and

3132
02:42:07,301 --> 02:42:08,800
say,
start again.

3133
02:42:08,830 --> 02:42:10,270
Do it again.
And,

3134
02:42:10,310 --> 02:42:12,550
and we rose.
I mean,

3135
02:42:12,880 --> 02:42:16,330
what's the chance of us snus being out 
there?

3136
02:42:16,331 --> 02:42:17,680
How many of them are there?

3137
02:42:17,970 --> 02:42:22,050
Well,
isn't the ultimate mind fuck the concept

3138
02:42:22,051 --> 02:42:27,051
of infinity?
Because the way I've heard it described 

3139
02:42:27,051 --> 02:42:27,090
that if infinity exists and they believe
it does,

3140
02:42:27,420 --> 02:42:31,110
that means the universe is so huge that 
everything that's ever happened on earth

3141
02:42:31,111 --> 02:42:36,111
in the exact same order,
it's happened in infant number of times 

3142
02:42:36,111 --> 02:42:36,111
somewhere else.

3143
02:42:36,111 --> 02:42:36,111
Well,
I had,

3144
02:42:36,111 --> 02:42:40,190
I once had a kind of a conversation with
the universe and I asked it,

3145
02:42:40,801 --> 02:42:44,910
so I went through a thought experiment 
where I went through the origin of life,

3146
02:42:45,390 --> 02:42:50,390
you know,
I just loaded my mind with everything I 

3147
02:42:50,390 --> 02:42:52,881
could do and I went through and saw it.
I was like super charged on all this 

3148
02:42:53,370 --> 02:42:57,930
stuff of my meditation and my thought 
experiments and I came out screaming,

3149
02:42:58,080 --> 02:43:03,080
you know,
I came into the division of the first 

3150
02:43:03,080 --> 02:43:05,091
proto cell and while it was happening,
I looked around and I saw all this crazy

3151
02:43:05,131 --> 02:43:10,131
molecular stuff going on,
which gave me the vision to work 

3152
02:43:10,131 --> 02:43:12,430
backwards to create the model that we're
just publishing now.

3153
02:43:12,970 --> 02:43:15,940
But I felt,
and this is kind of heretical,

3154
02:43:15,941 --> 02:43:20,941
but I,
I couldn't see that it was all 

3155
02:43:20,941 --> 02:43:20,941
mechanical,
you know,

3156
02:43:20,941 --> 02:43:23,230
it seemed like there was something doing
it.

3157
02:43:23,380 --> 02:43:25,060
I mean,
it was so complex.

3158
02:43:25,510 --> 02:43:27,360
So in this thought experiment,
I,

3159
02:43:27,720 --> 02:43:32,710
I sat up straight and I said,
I want to ask one more question if this,

3160
02:43:32,800 --> 02:43:35,220
if there's something before life.
There were,

3161
02:43:35,290 --> 02:43:38,230
if there was intelligence in the,
did this,

3162
02:43:38,231 --> 02:43:39,600
can I see it?
you know,

3163
02:43:39,610 --> 02:43:44,610
this is,
I think when you asked the ineffable 

3164
02:43:44,610 --> 02:43:46,951
these questions ineffable,
just get pissed off with questions 

3165
02:43:46,951 --> 02:43:50,170
sometimes and the inevitable,
what it did in my consciousness as I was

3166
02:43:50,171 --> 02:43:55,171
looking out into the night sky into the 
darkness and it resolved and to 

3167
02:43:56,120 --> 02:44:01,120
starfield and they'll start fill the 
rural salt into gas clouds and galaxies,

3168
02:44:01,271 --> 02:44:02,830
and then the whole thing came rushing 
into,

3169
02:44:03,190 --> 02:44:08,190
slammed into my consciousness sensor and
knocked me down and what the answer was 

3170
02:44:08,190 --> 02:44:13,110
you silly monkey.
The universe is big enough to have 

3171
02:44:13,110 --> 02:44:15,340
agency.
It grew big enough from the big bang.

3172
02:44:15,370 --> 02:44:19,480
It grew along the probability streams so
that this happened.

3173
02:44:20,170 --> 02:44:23,900
That's the answer.
There's one concept that I.

3174
02:44:25,100 --> 02:44:30,100
I can kinda understand infinity.
I can kind of understand a lot of the 

3175
02:44:30,761 --> 02:44:33,430
concepts of the cosmos,
but the big bang,

3176
02:44:33,850 --> 02:44:38,850
which is I hear it,
it goes in one ear and it goes out the 

3177
02:44:38,850 --> 02:44:41,410
other and it's just some words.
It's just some shit that's typed out.

3178
02:44:41,620 --> 02:44:45,670
It's just an idea that someone has that 
I can't conceptualize.

3179
02:44:45,900 --> 02:44:48,310
It doesn't.
my brain is too fucking dumb.

3180
02:44:48,610 --> 02:44:50,640
It just doesn't process it.
I,

3181
02:44:50,790 --> 02:44:54,070
I got a vision of it because it's,
it's hard for me to,

3182
02:44:54,071 --> 02:44:59,071
I mean the vision that I got,
I was sitting there in bed asking the 

3183
02:44:59,381 --> 02:45:04,381
question of what can I see pack,
so I wanted to see back and what came in

3184
02:45:06,521 --> 02:45:11,521
my head were three buckets and inside 
the three buckets were three blobs and 

3185
02:45:13,330 --> 02:45:18,330
eat.
one of the blobs is super low 

3186
02:45:18,330 --> 02:45:18,330
probability of ever happening.

3187
02:45:18,330 --> 02:45:20,810
The probability buckets and the others 
are kind of like ordinary rowboats.

3188
02:45:20,890 --> 02:45:25,890
And then there's a thIrd bucket.
Second bucket has a super low probably 

3189
02:45:25,890 --> 02:45:29,521
blob,
and then the third bucket has the low 

3190
02:45:29,521 --> 02:45:32,251
probably blog and the,
the intelligence that was communicating 

3191
02:45:32,251 --> 02:45:35,290
to me to teach me said,
watch me bing,

3192
02:45:35,410 --> 02:45:36,190
bing,
bing.

3193
02:45:36,191 --> 02:45:38,680
So when you say this though,
I'm sorry to interrupt you.

3194
02:45:38,830 --> 02:45:39,520
So the,
the,

3195
02:45:39,860 --> 02:45:44,860
what the intelligence showed me because 
I was asking the question and getting a 

3196
02:45:44,860 --> 02:45:47,971
thought experiment back was saying I can
trigger the lowest probability of hanse 

3197
02:45:48,130 --> 02:45:50,710
one after the other after the other.
And I said,

3198
02:45:50,740 --> 02:45:51,940
whoa,
okay.

3199
02:45:52,330 --> 02:45:53,440
And said,
watch me.

3200
02:45:53,441 --> 02:45:58,441
I will rotate them towards you.
So the buckets are all lined up and you 

3201
02:45:58,441 --> 02:45:59,860
say you see the path through the low 
probability events.

3202
02:46:00,070 --> 02:46:00,940
I say,
yes I do.

3203
02:46:00,941 --> 02:46:05,941
He says watch this.
And the path went all the way back to 

3204
02:46:05,941 --> 02:46:05,941
cosmo.

3205
02:46:05,941 --> 02:46:07,960
Genesys and I went,
oh my god,

3206
02:46:07,961 --> 02:46:12,961
you know,
this energy was pouring through super 

3207
02:46:12,961 --> 02:46:14,600
low probability and then the entity said
watch this.

3208
02:46:15,020 --> 02:46:20,020
And I was pulled back and I saw 
trillions of these tracers coming from,

3209
02:46:20,510 --> 02:46:22,460
from the singularity,
from the big bang.

3210
02:46:23,030 --> 02:46:28,030
And the answer was that is the power,
the power to trigger the lowest 

3211
02:46:28,030 --> 02:46:31,670
probability events in all directions.
And that is the power,

3212
02:46:32,110 --> 02:46:35,380
you know,
away from mundane it please.

3213
02:46:35,470 --> 02:46:40,470
So you're saying that you know,
you're communicating with an entity and 

3214
02:46:40,470 --> 02:46:40,470
you're saying,
you know,

3215
02:46:40,470 --> 02:46:40,670
this thing that's communicating with 
you,

3216
02:46:40,671 --> 02:46:43,730
this is more likely your imagination.
No.

3217
02:46:44,120 --> 02:46:49,120
Well sometimes it is imagination on 
steroids sometimes to stuff comes in.

3218
02:46:49,281 --> 02:46:51,680
It's like your friend you were talking 
about stuff comes in.

3219
02:46:51,681 --> 02:46:54,770
I don't know where from,
you know einstein for example,

3220
02:46:54,780 --> 02:46:59,780
used to do this.
Einstein will be having his coffee and 

3221
02:46:59,780 --> 02:47:03,380
his swiss cafe pondering about can can 
light go faster,

3222
02:47:04,130 --> 02:47:09,130
you know,
is there a constant and the speed of 

3223
02:47:09,130 --> 02:47:09,260
light and one night he just sort of sat 
down,

3224
02:47:09,560 --> 02:47:14,560
closed his eyes and suddenly he was in 
this endogenous world and you can read 

3225
02:47:14,560 --> 02:47:14,560
about this.

3226
02:47:14,560 --> 02:47:17,480
He called it good duncan experiments,
thought experiments.

3227
02:47:17,481 --> 02:47:19,820
He would say,
I'm going to try to understand this,

3228
02:47:20,150 --> 02:47:25,150
but he would open himself to anything 
and what came into einstein's mind was 

3229
02:47:25,150 --> 02:47:30,100
he became like a train.
He was like mounted onto a train and 

3230
02:47:30,100 --> 02:47:34,181
there was another train coming down the 
track and they each had so it was at 

3231
02:47:34,181 --> 02:47:35,870
night and the light was streaming out 
and he said,

3232
02:47:35,871 --> 02:47:39,410
but how can I be the photon going toward
that?

3233
02:47:39,411 --> 02:47:44,411
Other photon in the photons are going 
twice the speed of light relative to 

3234
02:47:44,411 --> 02:47:46,310
each other and then he had this credible
insights about,

3235
02:47:46,460 --> 02:47:51,460
no,
it's possible if you have different 

3236
02:47:51,460 --> 02:47:51,460
frames of reference,
it's possible.

3237
02:47:51,820 --> 02:47:56,120
His face change in all the whole special
on general theory of relativity came out

3238
02:47:56,121 --> 02:47:59,540
from these thought experiments that he 
did that he didn't quite know where they

3239
02:47:59,541 --> 02:48:02,000
came from.
They just sort of poured into him.

3240
02:48:02,510 --> 02:48:06,140
Then he had to interpret and into 
mathematics and into testable theories.

3241
02:48:06,580 --> 02:48:07,160
Well,
when we're.

3242
02:48:07,161 --> 02:48:09,030
do any ideas come from though really?
when,

3243
02:48:09,040 --> 02:48:09,630
where,
why?

3244
02:48:09,640 --> 02:48:12,290
Why consider the possibility that coming
from entities?

3245
02:48:12,291 --> 02:48:14,330
why don't why?
I just think this is your mind,

3246
02:48:14,331 --> 02:48:18,360
your imagination.
Just contemplating possibilities and,

3247
02:48:18,460 --> 02:48:20,950
and here's where I think,
oh,

3248
02:48:21,030 --> 02:48:24,580
this is a really big woo model because 
this wound,

3249
02:48:24,581 --> 02:48:26,720
wu on the front of the stove,
the t shirt here.

3250
02:48:27,170 --> 02:48:31,730
I think that somehow our minds when 
we're open and we're,

3251
02:48:31,820 --> 02:48:36,820
we're in a state of not distraction or 
boundaries or dissolved and we're in a 

3252
02:48:38,091 --> 02:48:43,091
clear state that our minds are big 
enough computational engines to resonate

3253
02:48:43,461 --> 02:48:46,970
with a whole lot of shit non locally.
So for example,

3254
02:48:46,971 --> 02:48:50,180
you believe nonlocal intelligence.
You think that like perhaps there's some

3255
02:48:50,181 --> 02:48:52,910
sort of a universal intelligence out 
there that you can tune into.

3256
02:48:53,170 --> 02:48:57,440
I think that in some way,
like for example,

3257
02:48:57,680 --> 02:49:01,460
if you trace all of the neuronal 
pathways down,

3258
02:49:01,461 --> 02:49:03,710
all the synapses and across all the 
caps,

3259
02:49:03,711 --> 02:49:06,860
backwards and forwards in your mind,
and you can look this up online,

3260
02:49:07,380 --> 02:49:12,150
the number of those tracers,
those unique strings is larger,

3261
02:49:12,370 --> 02:49:17,370
you know,
or an equivalent or larger than the 

3262
02:49:17,370 --> 02:49:17,370
number of subatomic particles in the 
universe.

3263
02:49:17,850 --> 02:49:19,680
Now,
all accountable objects in the universe.

3264
02:49:19,710 --> 02:49:24,710
It's this huge.
The common materials are huge because 

3265
02:49:24,710 --> 02:49:26,460
the brain says this network and as soon 
as it ramps up,

3266
02:49:26,880 --> 02:49:28,350
so your brain,
if you.

3267
02:49:28,680 --> 02:49:31,470
It's like an informational system,
a coding system that,

3268
02:49:31,820 --> 02:49:36,820
uh,
if you could activate this pathway and 

3269
02:49:36,820 --> 02:49:36,820
that little variation of that pathway 
and that will,

3270
02:49:36,820 --> 02:49:40,500
is actually bigger than the universe.
And of course it's in the universe to,

3271
02:49:40,501 --> 02:49:45,501
it's not bigger than itself.
But then you have the idea of non 

3272
02:49:45,611 --> 02:49:50,611
locality where everything talks to 
everything non locally,

3273
02:49:51,090 --> 02:49:56,090
you know,
and instantly was this bell's theorem 

3274
02:49:56,090 --> 02:49:58,260
and all this sorts of things.
And so could it be that there's some,

3275
02:49:58,261 --> 02:50:03,261
and this is a total who hand wavy thing.
It could it be that your mind really 

3276
02:50:03,261 --> 02:50:07,491
fully activated,
really fully present through your 

3277
02:50:07,491 --> 02:50:07,491
filters,
through your training,

3278
02:50:07,491 --> 02:50:10,440
whether you're a roman catholic or 
you're a skeptical,

3279
02:50:10,920 --> 02:50:15,750
whatever you stuff can come in that's 
resonating from some field,

3280
02:50:16,140 --> 02:50:20,160
another intelligence objects,
patterns,

3281
02:50:20,520 --> 02:50:25,520
stuff in time and history beyond what 
our little reductionist kind of 

3282
02:50:26,250 --> 02:50:31,250
mechanical thinking gives us that could 
we be resonating with real shit that's 

3283
02:50:31,250 --> 02:50:34,290
out there,
that's beyond what our training is,

3284
02:50:34,680 --> 02:50:36,120
but it will be filtered throughout 
training.

3285
02:50:37,760 --> 02:50:39,850
You're sort of tapping into some 
incredible,

3286
02:50:39,851 --> 02:50:43,570
ultimate potential,
some potential for accessing information

3287
02:50:43,571 --> 02:50:45,660
and,
and possibilities for,

3288
02:50:45,720 --> 02:50:48,700
for possibilities as far as connections 
possibilities,

3289
02:50:48,701 --> 02:50:53,701
as far as like putting things together 
in your head and proposing the various 

3290
02:50:54,431 --> 02:50:56,650
scenarios that maybe wouldn't be 
available.

3291
02:50:57,310 --> 02:50:59,890
If you impose limitations on where they 
came from,

3292
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:05,000
you try to figure out with your training
in your to do list and your algorithms,

3293
02:51:05,300 --> 02:51:10,300
you'd never get there.
So you're literally have to blow your 

3294
02:51:10,300 --> 02:51:10,300
mind completely open.
You know,

3295
02:51:10,300 --> 02:51:10,300
uh,
uh,

3296
02:51:10,770 --> 02:51:15,770
uh,
graham hancock gave a fantastic example 

3297
02:51:15,770 --> 02:51:17,690
on your show within the last month,
which was a telescope.

3298
02:51:17,750 --> 02:51:22,750
Remember that needs to shape change the 
shape of the lands in order for you to 

3299
02:51:22,750 --> 02:51:25,640
resolve and see stars and galaxies.
Right?

3300
02:51:25,641 --> 02:51:28,910
So those people who never use telescopes
say,

3301
02:51:28,911 --> 02:51:33,911
well,
you shouldn't have to perturb the mind 

3302
02:51:33,911 --> 02:51:33,911
to see what's out there.
Well,

3303
02:51:33,911 --> 02:51:35,180
they've never looked through a 
telescope,

3304
02:51:35,280 --> 02:51:37,370
right?
So we should,

3305
02:51:37,371 --> 02:51:40,040
as a species,
we realize we need to perturb our.

3306
02:51:40,190 --> 02:51:45,190
Mine's always have a huge problem with 
people that say you shouldn't perturb 

3307
02:51:45,190 --> 02:51:49,051
the mind because I don't see the 
negative impact of perturbing the mind 

3308
02:51:49,051 --> 02:51:51,721
and I see a massive amount of positive 
and then I see these people saying you 

3309
02:51:51,721 --> 02:51:54,391
shouldn't perturb the mind and they 
haven't perturbed them on something 

3310
02:51:54,391 --> 02:51:54,391
like,
well,

3311
02:51:54,391 --> 02:51:57,811
what are you talking about?
Like anyone who says that like 

3312
02:51:57,811 --> 02:51:59,990
psychedelic experiences are not valuable
and hasn't had psychedelic experiences.

3313
02:51:59,991 --> 02:52:01,150
I'm like,
okay,

3314
02:52:01,240 --> 02:52:03,760
we're just going around in circles here.
We're talking crazy.

3315
02:52:03,761 --> 02:52:06,310
Like you don't know whether they're 
valued and you're just totally.

3316
02:52:06,510 --> 02:52:09,910
They've never floated or they've never 
done meditation.

3317
02:52:09,970 --> 02:52:13,480
But the what I think the beauty of 
psychedelic experience,

3318
02:52:13,510 --> 02:52:18,510
the actual taking of a psychedelic is,
is that it's undeniable mushrooms work 

3319
02:52:18,910 --> 02:52:21,070
on everybody.
Dmt works well.

3320
02:52:21,071 --> 02:52:24,460
Some people,
some weird freak people apparently don't

3321
02:52:25,060 --> 02:52:27,370
have dmt experiences.
I don't know.

3322
02:52:28,000 --> 02:52:30,370
The problem is it's so illegal and it's 
so.

3323
02:52:30,371 --> 02:52:35,371
It's so difficult to to.
I don't think strassman had any people 

3324
02:52:35,371 --> 02:52:38,101
that didn't find a an impact for the 
intravenous dmt studies that he did at 

3325
02:52:38,261 --> 02:52:43,261
university of New Mexico,
but I think that people that say it's 

3326
02:52:43,261 --> 02:52:47,731
not valuable and haven't experienced it,
you're discounting it just thousands,

3327
02:52:47,891 --> 02:52:52,891
millions,
perhaps people who have had incredibly 

3328
02:52:52,891 --> 02:52:54,190
valuable experiences doing it and you're
saying you don't need it.

3329
02:52:54,270 --> 02:52:56,020
Like you know,
you're scared.

3330
02:52:56,110 --> 02:53:01,110
You're scared.
All these tribal cultures and that 

3331
02:53:01,110 --> 02:53:02,970
needed that use that to initiate people 
into humanity,

3332
02:53:02,971 --> 02:53:03,970
to human being.

3333
02:53:04,210 --> 02:53:09,210
I think from then then your idea of 
endogenous access becomes becomes very 

3334
02:53:11,261 --> 02:53:15,070
attractive and it also becomes more 
plausible because people know that these

3335
02:53:15,071 --> 02:53:18,700
states are reachable because I think 
without knowing,

3336
02:53:18,701 --> 02:53:21,670
like I remember the first time I had any
psychedelic experience,

3337
02:53:21,671 --> 02:53:24,720
the first really big one was a five men.
Oh,

3338
02:53:24,760 --> 02:53:29,380
I had a small mushroom experience,
but the five meo dmt experience.

3339
02:53:29,381 --> 02:53:33,940
Like after that I can remember really 
clearly thinkinG,

3340
02:53:33,970 --> 02:53:38,970
well,
now that I know that this is a 

3341
02:53:38,970 --> 02:53:38,970
possibility,
I have to kind of rethink,

3342
02:53:38,970 --> 02:53:40,330
rethink my spectrum,
everything,

3343
02:53:40,420 --> 02:53:45,420
and so then one could see reaching these
incredible states through some sort of 

3344
02:53:47,411 --> 02:53:52,411
indogenous method that maybe perhaps he 
would have never even given it the 

3345
02:53:52,411 --> 02:53:56,311
chance before and I think you know,
you're looking african communities that 

3346
02:53:56,311 --> 02:54:00,541
used ibogaine as an initiatory 
experience on ordeal or initiate or 

3347
02:54:00,641 --> 02:54:05,641
experience.
they're trying to take those uninformed 

3348
02:54:05,641 --> 02:54:06,970
youths that think they know everything 
right,

3349
02:54:07,380 --> 02:54:11,740
and they're and they're exposing them to
something so massive that forces them to

3350
02:54:11,741 --> 02:54:16,741
challenge their own internal state and 
and come to terms with fears or other 

3351
02:54:17,891 --> 02:54:20,410
things and broaden themselves out there.

3352
02:54:20,410 --> 02:54:24,160
We even there weft as a human beIng.
When they come out of that,

3353
02:54:24,610 --> 02:54:29,610
they're a member of the community and 
they're trustable and they look each 

3354
02:54:29,610 --> 02:54:33,061
other in the eye and they had the taps.
They're not children name or not 

3355
02:54:33,061 --> 02:54:36,270
juvenile anymore,
and this is perhaps it was stolen from 

3356
02:54:36,270 --> 02:54:38,670
us when we lost our initiatory rights 
and was taken away by priests.

3357
02:54:38,680 --> 02:54:42,970
It was taken away by corporations or,
or maybe it's just a blip.

3358
02:54:43,300 --> 02:54:48,300
I mean maybe it's not taken away.
Maybe it's just in our context of our 

3359
02:54:48,300 --> 02:54:51,181
lives.
We'd look at a thousand years being so 

3360
02:54:51,181 --> 02:54:51,350
long,
but in the universe said nothing.

3361
02:54:51,930 --> 02:54:53,200
Nothing.
And if this state,

3362
02:54:53,201 --> 02:54:56,860
this the look to the life of the earth,
it's enough and then nothing.

3363
02:54:56,861 --> 02:54:58,390
so we're like,
it's been taken away from us.

3364
02:54:58,450 --> 02:55:01,330
Like now we're talking about it.
It's not going anywhere.

3365
02:55:02,250 --> 02:55:02,850
We're.
Yeah,

3366
02:55:02,890 --> 02:55:03,570
we're,
we're,

3367
02:55:03,800 --> 02:55:05,390
we're celebrating its return.

3368
02:55:06,000 --> 02:55:06,950
Listen,
we're out of time,

3369
02:55:06,951 --> 02:55:09,290
but this is an amazing conversation.
We could have 100 of these.

3370
02:55:09,291 --> 02:55:10,730
I think we really could.
We could,

3371
02:55:10,740 --> 02:55:15,740
we could go.
We could take the what if train to the 

3372
02:55:15,740 --> 02:55:19,510
end of mars and back and I would like to
come back and bring you a bunch of 

3373
02:55:19,510 --> 02:55:20,590
artifacts like that original miles that 
you can,

3374
02:55:20,780 --> 02:55:24,320
you can play with on the show here.
I would love that.

3375
02:55:24,321 --> 02:55:27,770
I would love that.

3376

ord.

3382
02:55:42,370 --> 02:55:45,530
We rebuilt the site just for you,
joe,

3383
02:55:45,531 --> 02:55:47,900
last week.
It's all new word press theme.

3384
02:55:48,050 --> 02:55:50,540
Oh,
I'm worried about the impact yet.

3385
02:55:50,541 --> 02:55:53,960
We've been on new servers,
crashed into that website right now.

3386
02:55:53,961 --> 02:55:58,040
Let's crash it and love it and if 
anybody wants to reach me,

3388
02:55:58,700 --> 02:56:00,730
Bruce,
at [inaudible] dot com.

3389
02:56:00,740 --> 02:56:03,680
You just made a huge mistake.
So that's a tremendous mistake.

3390
02:56:03,681 --> 02:56:08,681
Prepare for a tsunami of dick's coming 
your way and who knows what kind of 

3391
02:56:08,681 --> 02:56:11,840
photographs could be a disaster.
It could be done that filter those out.

3392
02:56:12,330 --> 02:56:17,330
You might to add slides.
I should have stopped you anyway.

3393
02:56:17,690 --> 02:56:18,470
Um,
so the,

3394
02:56:18,471 --> 02:56:21,350

itunes.
