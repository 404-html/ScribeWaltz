1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,710
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:03,600
It's amazing that you were like,

3
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:06,180
you're so entrenched in them.

4
00:00:06,181 --> 00:00:06,371
Yeah.

5
00:00:06,371 --> 00:00:07,410
You seem like a pretty,

6
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,150
pretty together dude.

7
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:09,721
I think so.

8
00:00:09,721 --> 00:00:09,951
I mean,

9
00:00:09,951 --> 00:00:10,110
I'm,

10
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:10,980
kids changed me.

11
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:11,191
I mean,

12
00:00:11,191 --> 00:00:11,461
I got,

13
00:00:11,461 --> 00:00:12,271
I got two young,

14
00:00:12,271 --> 00:00:13,140
I got a two year old in a,

15
00:00:13,141 --> 00:00:15,300
in a five month old
and my wife changed me.

16
00:00:15,301 --> 00:00:15,451
I mean,

17
00:00:15,451 --> 00:00:16,410
I never thought I'd get married.

18
00:00:16,411 --> 00:00:16,531
I mean,

19
00:00:16,531 --> 00:00:17,130
I was living,

20
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:17,881
when I got on hoarders,

21
00:00:17,881 --> 00:00:19,110
I was living on a buddy's couch.

22
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:21,030
I was cleaning up Shit
for 12 bucks an hour,

23
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,040
literally shoveling shit
for 12 bucks an hour.

24
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,030
And anybody who would hire me,

25
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:25,020
look a dog,

26
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,580
like people's dogs know people's houses.

27
00:00:26,581 --> 00:00:30,240
I'd go into a hoarder house and clean up
their shit for 12 bucks an hour before

28
00:00:30,241 --> 00:00:31,170
the show even.

29
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:31,870
Yeah.

30
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:34,170
I was cleaning houses for four years.

31
00:00:34,171 --> 00:00:35,610
I hit when I hit rock bottom,

32
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:35,851
I mean,

33
00:00:35,851 --> 00:00:37,020
I literally lost everything.

34
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,590
I was living on a buddy's couch for 200
bucks a month and I couldn't come up

35
00:00:40,591 --> 00:00:41,850
with 200 bucks the third month.

36
00:00:41,851 --> 00:00:42,684
He was like,

37
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:42,961
dude,

38
00:00:42,961 --> 00:00:43,141
you know,

39
00:00:43,141 --> 00:00:43,320
you're,

40
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,190
we're 30 man.

41
00:00:44,191 --> 00:00:46,500
Like you gotta you gotta do something,

42
00:00:46,501 --> 00:00:46,800
man.

43
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,190
I remember,

44
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:47,611
I'll never forget.

45
00:00:47,611 --> 00:00:48,660
I mean that's like something I'll Pi guys.

46
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,033
I,

47
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,330
my 30th birthday I call,

48
00:00:51,331 --> 00:00:54,420
I was engaged to another girl
and I realized they're like,

49
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:55,620
my life is a fucking joke.

50
00:00:55,621 --> 00:00:57,150
Like I can't pull her into this.

51
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:57,591
I'm not,

52
00:00:57,591 --> 00:00:58,740
I got no business being married.

53
00:00:58,741 --> 00:01:01,200
And so I called off the wedding like
a month before Husky getting married.

54
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:01,860
Wow.

55
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:02,221
And it was,

56
00:01:02,221 --> 00:01:03,060
that was a hard decision.

57
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,540
And I was living on my buddy's
couch and I was my 30th birthday,

58
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:07,110
which you know,

59
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,280
is a milestone in your head.

60
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:09,780
And I said to my mom and my mom's like,

61
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:10,590
what do you want?

62
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:11,550
It's been a hell of a year.

63
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:12,511
And I was like,

64
00:01:12,511 --> 00:01:13,650
I need a pair of running shoes.

65
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,180
And I couldn't afford,

66
00:01:15,181 --> 00:01:17,790
I was trying to run a marathon that
year and I couldn't affair for a pair of

67
00:01:17,791 --> 00:01:18,360
shoes to run.

68
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,193
I didn't have no money.

69
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,450
I would like a hundred
grand in credit cards.

70
00:01:21,451 --> 00:01:22,081
And I mean,

71
00:01:22,081 --> 00:01:22,914
it was scary.

72
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,750
So I started cleaning
up old ladies' houses.

73
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:25,550
Wow.

74
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:27,060
And how'd you get that job?

75
00:01:27,061 --> 00:01:27,241
Like,

76
00:01:27,241 --> 00:01:27,900
how did I,

77
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:28,790
my dad died?

78
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:29,491
The biggest thing,

79
00:01:29,491 --> 00:01:33,540
important thing of my life from me with
my dad dying when I was 24 and that

80
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:34,351
changed my life and he,

81
00:01:34,351 --> 00:01:35,190
my dad,

82
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:36,570
I was a fucking asshole.

83
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:37,740
I was just a piece of shit.

84
00:01:37,741 --> 00:01:39,330
All I cared about was drinking,

85
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,280
gambling and him,

86
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,133
women,

87
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,050
all three great things.

88
00:01:43,051 --> 00:01:43,591
Don't get me wrong.

89
00:01:43,591 --> 00:01:44,880
I mean my twenties were really fun.

90
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,720
It sounds like you had a good
time and I lost [inaudible].

91
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,780
Did you stop at a blast?

92
00:01:48,781 --> 00:01:52,740
I really be talking to a guy who I spend
a good deal of my youth and pool halls.

93
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:53,251
Yeah,

94
00:01:53,251 --> 00:01:53,630
so you,

95
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:54,300
I mean the hustle.

96
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,840
I was hustling man paddocks
on a regular basis.

97
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:58,951
But you very,

98
00:01:58,951 --> 00:01:59,760
very common.

99
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,150
Yeah.

100
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,050
I mean for me,

101
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:02,310
I didn't,

102
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,440
I hadn't honed my hustle
in the right place.

103
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:05,910
I'm still a hustler.

104
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,450
I'm just doing it on TV in a positive way.

105
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:10,950
I never changed who I am.

106
00:02:10,951 --> 00:02:11,581
I'm just able,

107
00:02:11,581 --> 00:02:14,310
I've learned I'm able to make more
money in a positive way than I am in a

108
00:02:14,311 --> 00:02:15,000
negative way.

109
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,781
How people don't talk.

110
00:02:15,781 --> 00:02:16,410
Like I talk,

111
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:18,390
they don't say the things
I say and I've learned.

112
00:02:18,391 --> 00:02:21,480
Just being brutally honest
is the best hustle there is.

113
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,970
How did you get into this environment?

114
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,430
Where you around like
gamblers and how did,

115
00:02:26,431 --> 00:02:27,330
how did all this happen?

116
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,201
Oh Man.

117
00:02:28,201 --> 00:02:28,710
I just,

118
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:29,101
I love,

119
00:02:29,101 --> 00:02:31,170
at the first time I went to
casino I fell in love with it,

120
00:02:31,171 --> 00:02:31,470
man.

121
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,000
How old were you a college?

122
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,280
This Guy George.

123
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,440
So that's when he became a gamble.

124
00:02:35,441 --> 00:02:36,610
Yannick [inaudible],

125
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:37,710
this Guy George Rome,

126
00:02:37,711 --> 00:02:38,491
and he had Tourette's.

127
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,480
Really cool dude.

128
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,340
He was a very confident guy.

129
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:41,971
He had Tourette's,

130
00:02:41,971 --> 00:02:42,661
but he didn't give a shit.

131
00:02:42,661 --> 00:02:43,830
It was like your problem
that he had Tourette's.

132
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:44,521
Wow.

133
00:02:44,521 --> 00:02:45,181
That's awesome.

134
00:02:45,181 --> 00:02:46,020
Very confident guy.

135
00:02:46,021 --> 00:02:47,310
And so I was like very attracted.

136
00:02:47,311 --> 00:02:47,551
I was like,

137
00:02:47,551 --> 00:02:47,761
man,

138
00:02:47,761 --> 00:02:49,200
this is a cool fucking guy.

139
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,610
Like he put it on you.

140
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:53,790
He did not care that he had Tourette's
and he would get the hottest chicks at

141
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:54,600
school.

142
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,800
He's a really awesome,

143
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:56,634
confident guy.

144
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,120
And I,

145
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,080
my dad always told me,

146
00:02:58,081 --> 00:02:58,351
he's like,

147
00:02:58,351 --> 00:02:59,530
you're never gonna be the looking guy.

148
00:02:59,531 --> 00:03:00,850
You'll never be the hardest working guy.

149
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:05,530
You gotta be the most confident cause
it's like that's your only in like you got

150
00:03:05,531 --> 00:03:07,480
no other value added thing broke you off.

151
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:07,791
No,

152
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:08,840
he just was honest.

153
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:09,471
He's like,

154
00:03:09,471 --> 00:03:10,304
you know,

155
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,530
you're not going to be rich.

156
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:12,710
You're not going to be rich.

157
00:03:12,711 --> 00:03:13,490
You're not going to be,

158
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:14,190
you know,

159
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,023
here's a rule.

160
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,040
You ain't got a big dig.

161
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:16,910
It is what it is.

162
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,430
And my dad got it mad,

163
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,750
mad women.

164
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:20,291
I mean he got,

165
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:21,310
and he was so ugly,

166
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,660
but he just loved him.

167
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,320
He knew how to,

168
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:23,801
he talked.

169
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:24,370
Honest,

170
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,760
he talked on us and he treated them like
he treated with respect and as a woman.

171
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,470
And so I learned a lot from him.

172
00:03:29,471 --> 00:03:30,430
But when my dad died,

173
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,560
I went to this little place
called comfort zone camp.

174
00:03:32,561 --> 00:03:34,510
It's a camp for kids that
have lost their dads.

175
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:35,620
And so I was,

176
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,210
you know,

177
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:38,940
we helped to build the La camp
and my wife and I did my eye,

178
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:39,783
but I met her there.

179
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,630
And uh,

180
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,190
but we helped build these
camps for these kids at all.

181
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:44,170
Their dads had buy a diet and drive bys.

182
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,630
So you meet all these 12 year
old kids that are going in,

183
00:03:46,631 --> 00:03:50,170
you know they're getting recruited by
gangs already cause their dads have

184
00:03:50,171 --> 00:03:50,491
already there.

185
00:03:50,491 --> 00:03:52,020
There are 23 year old dads,

186
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:52,271
you know,

187
00:03:52,271 --> 00:03:54,280
had been killed 25 zero we did.

188
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:55,271
So we learn,

189
00:03:55,271 --> 00:03:56,020
I mean I just,

190
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:59,410
grief was a huge part
early on and so for me,

191
00:03:59,411 --> 00:04:00,940
like when I got Adam,

192
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:04,690
I really rock bottom and I realize it's
time to get going where I figured that

193
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,140
out,

194
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,450
the doing good versus
doing bad was at this camp.

195
00:04:07,451 --> 00:04:07,750
I would,

196
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,890
I got addicted to that camp.

197
00:04:08,891 --> 00:04:11,890
I volunteered every single weekend and
I would just make it go away for three

198
00:04:11,891 --> 00:04:15,370
nights and hanging out these kids and
that's when I got my new addiction was

199
00:04:15,371 --> 00:04:16,270
then wow.

200
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,410
It changed my life.

201
00:04:17,411 --> 00:04:18,940
That place changed when
I met my wife there.

202
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:20,380
I came up with new business,

203
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,250
my business clutter cleaner.

204
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:21,761
I came up with it.

205
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:22,930
They're helping these kids.

206
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:25,390
I met a lot of great women
and met my wife there.

207
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:26,470
So I mean I wouldn't have what I have.

208
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,470
How did you pull yourself
out of the gambling spar?

209
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,170
You said you found you.

210
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,120
So I ran like a fucking chicken man.

211
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:31,351
I mean,

212
00:04:31,351 --> 00:04:36,351
I got my ass kicked by a bookie and I
owed 40 grand the night before I had $10

213
00:04:37,841 --> 00:04:38,674
left to my name.

214
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,800
I knew I owed this bookie when it was,

215
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:44,230
I mean I think it was 40
grand and it was a lot.

216
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:48,340
I knew I only had $10 in my pocket
and my girlfriend was waiting for me.

217
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:49,720
I was in Lake Tahoe.

218
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,600
She was waiting for me at the
top of the hill up in heaven.

219
00:04:51,601 --> 00:04:53,590
Lee and I was gambling all night.

220
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:54,520
I can't hide Tendai what,

221
00:04:54,521 --> 00:04:57,610
$5 in my mind I thought I had $5 at
the end of the night and I was like,

222
00:04:57,611 --> 00:04:58,301
I better put this down.

223
00:04:58,301 --> 00:04:59,380
I got to get a cab ride home.

224
00:04:59,381 --> 00:05:04,381
So I was giving up at $5 to my
name and I owed 42 the booking.

225
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:06,880
Yeah.

226
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,760
Which for a 24 year old kid and make
it not making that as a lot of money.

227
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,500
And so I put the chip down.

228
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:12,543
Lost,

229
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,690
came out.

230
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:14,051
I had no,

231
00:05:14,051 --> 00:05:14,471
my last,

232
00:05:14,471 --> 00:05:18,580
my last dollar came out and had nothing
and it was like I got a fucking problem.

233
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:23,170
And so I was looking at the cabby and
he's like the guy that drove me back every

234
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:24,280
night and he was like,

235
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:25,780
he looked at me and was like,

236
00:05:25,781 --> 00:05:26,441
I got no money man.

237
00:05:26,441 --> 00:05:29,530
So I started walking up hill five
miles uphill to the ski resort.

238
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,680
Tom's a very uh,

239
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,400
awesome isolating place.

240
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,540
So it was a five mile,

241
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:36,030
it's inclined roads.

242
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,070
We went up and I'm walking up this thing
and he came and picked me up and he was

243
00:05:39,071 --> 00:05:39,221
like,

244
00:05:39,221 --> 00:05:39,461
dude,

245
00:05:39,461 --> 00:05:40,030
you got to,

246
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:40,990
you got to get your life together man.

247
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,610
You've got gotta quit
gambling and everyone is,

248
00:05:42,611 --> 00:05:45,610
and at that point I was still judging
people and I was like looking at this,

249
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:45,941
I was like,

250
00:05:45,941 --> 00:05:50,210
this poor stupid cab driver knew
God knows what happened to him,

251
00:05:50,211 --> 00:05:53,110
but I was totally judging
him yet he's saving me,

252
00:05:53,111 --> 00:05:54,370
he's picking me up.

253
00:05:54,371 --> 00:05:57,260
And so I'm still treating this guy
like in my mind like a piece of shit.

254
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:58,491
And he picks me up.

255
00:05:58,491 --> 00:05:59,271
He dropped me off and I'm like,

256
00:05:59,271 --> 00:06:00,110
can I give you anything?

257
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:00,470
Can I,

258
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:00,910
can I it?

259
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:01,221
He's like,

260
00:06:01,221 --> 00:06:01,520
dude,

261
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,420
just stop gambling.

262
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,530
And he looked at me like,

263
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,700
just fucking stop.

264
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:05,950
That's when they just off.

265
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:06,290
Well,

266
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:08,210
and I called my mom the next
morning and she was like,

267
00:06:08,211 --> 00:06:09,044
you're on your own.

268
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:09,660
So then I went,

269
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,730
I called the bookie and I was like,

270
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,440
I don't know what to do man.

271
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,200
I don't have the money.

272
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:12,900
And I mean,

273
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:13,671
this was like a movie.

274
00:06:13,671 --> 00:06:14,360
He's like,

275
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,380
no worries man.

276
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,120
Everything's gonna be fine.

277
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:18,583
We'll work it out.

278
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,633
What do you have?

279
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:20,181
I was like,

280
00:06:20,181 --> 00:06:21,980
I might be able to scrounge up $1,000.

281
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:22,760
He goes,

282
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,300
no worries.

283
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:23,771
Come on down.

284
00:06:23,771 --> 00:06:25,430
I'll meet you down this afternoon.

285
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:26,091
So I was like,

286
00:06:26,091 --> 00:06:27,050
this isn't like movies at all.

287
00:06:27,051 --> 00:06:27,501
This is great.

288
00:06:27,501 --> 00:06:27,711
This,

289
00:06:27,711 --> 00:06:28,544
we're going to work it out.

290
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:29,440
And I went down,

291
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,160
he took the thousand bucks and
he'd beat the shit out of me,

292
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,593
broke my nose.

293
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:33,920
I totally was just clueless.

294
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:34,540
And he,

295
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,000
he just,

296
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,410
he broke my nose and
beat the shit out of me.

297
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:38,030
That was my rock bottom.

298
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,261
And I was like,

299
00:06:39,261 --> 00:06:40,430
what the fuck am I going to do?

300
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:41,570
So I called around,

301
00:06:41,571 --> 00:06:42,830
I call it an old boss,

302
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,401
and I told him,

303
00:06:43,401 --> 00:06:43,620
what did,

304
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,361
my mom had already said,

305
00:06:44,361 --> 00:06:45,080
you're on your own.

306
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,190
Find a legal way out.

307
00:06:46,191 --> 00:06:49,910
And that was the night where I put a
lot of dumb shit on the board mean I was

308
00:06:49,911 --> 00:06:50,050
like,

309
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:50,240
alright,

310
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,710
I'll just be a prostitute
or I'll do whatever.

311
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:52,101
Like I was like,

312
00:06:52,101 --> 00:06:52,460
Oh,

313
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:52,641
you know,

314
00:06:52,641 --> 00:06:52,971
I was like,

315
00:06:52,971 --> 00:06:54,260
I can be mentally strong.

316
00:06:54,261 --> 00:06:55,250
I can figure this out.

317
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:57,230
And I was lying to myself saying,

318
00:06:57,231 --> 00:06:58,160
I can figure this out.

319
00:06:58,490 --> 00:06:59,180
Wow.

320
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:02,750
And so ended up an old boss got
me a job in Chicago when he goes,

321
00:07:02,751 --> 00:07:03,351
when can you get,

322
00:07:03,351 --> 00:07:04,220
this was a Tuesday night.

323
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:04,521
And he goes,

324
00:07:04,521 --> 00:07:05,354
when can you get there?

325
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:05,991
And I was like,

326
00:07:05,991 --> 00:07:06,560
Friday.

327
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:06,801
He goes,

328
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:07,760
you start Friday,

329
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:09,290
they're going to pay off the bookie,

330
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:10,640
but you're gonna have to
work for a year to pay it.

331
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,401
They're going to take it out,

332
00:07:11,401 --> 00:07:12,260
peace out every night.

333
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:13,311
And I was like,

334
00:07:13,311 --> 00:07:13,671

335
00:07:13,671 --> 00:07:14,121
thank you.

336
00:07:14,121 --> 00:07:15,050
And I literally,

337
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:15,891
my buddy,

338
00:07:15,891 --> 00:07:17,180
I didn't have money to get home,

339
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,490
so I had to play poker that night.

340
00:07:18,491 --> 00:07:22,880
Bar 50 bucks from a buddy and play one
enough money playing poker to get gas

341
00:07:22,881 --> 00:07:23,330
money.

342
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:23,960
Oh my God.

343
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,550
And that's why I drove home
and I never gambled again.

344
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,121
Really?

345
00:07:26,121 --> 00:07:26,780
You just quit?

346
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,640
I quit a ran away and I still run away.

347
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:29,690
I still run away today.

348
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,700
I just don't get,

349
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,000
I mean like this is the worst week for me.

350
00:07:32,001 --> 00:07:32,650
The first,

351
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:32,950
uh,

352
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,220
the NCAA tournament.

353
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,450
Oh.

354
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:36,050
Killing me.

355
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:36,541
Killing me,

356
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:36,680
man.

357
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,101
Oh my God.

358
00:07:37,101 --> 00:07:37,690
I love it.

359
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:38,660
Do you still watch it?

360
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,090
Oh yeah.

361
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:39,410
Love it.

362
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:40,131
Oh Wow.

363
00:07:40,131 --> 00:07:40,964
No,

364
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,260
I just don't do the sheets.

365
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:43,400
I delete all the emails.

366
00:07:43,401 --> 00:07:44,360
I just can't do the sheets.

367
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:45,290
Wow.

368
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:46,270
That's crazy.

369
00:07:46,271 --> 00:07:48,160
So you just love that kind
of limited in every day.

370
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:48,580
I,

371
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:48,881
you know,

372
00:07:48,881 --> 00:07:50,470
I don't sort of,

373
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:51,700
well you have a handle on it.

374
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,960
I think gambling eight years,

375
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:53,860
I don't really,

376
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:54,510
yeah,

377
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,000
I'm lucky.

378
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,250
I mean my kids are just wearing me out
and I don't really have the effort for

379
00:07:57,251 --> 00:07:58,360
that kind of stuff anymore.

380
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:59,770
Does it still draw you though?

381
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,180
Every once in a while I get that itch.

382
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:01,451
Yeah.

383
00:08:01,451 --> 00:08:02,380
Every once in a while I'll get that.

384
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:03,041
Like I had it this year.

385
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:07,060
I had a really bad itch and I had a
flight to Vegas to do a hoarder's episode

386
00:08:07,061 --> 00:08:08,050
and it wasn't even in Vegas.

387
00:08:08,051 --> 00:08:10,090
I just had a three hour
layover and I was like,

388
00:08:10,091 --> 00:08:10,481
fuck yeah,

389
00:08:10,481 --> 00:08:11,350
I'm going downtown.

390
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:14,410
And I got excited and I hadn't
had that itch in a long time.

391
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:15,490
Like I can drink,

392
00:08:15,491 --> 00:08:16,151
I can smoke,

393
00:08:16,151 --> 00:08:17,410
I can do whatever because I can walk,

394
00:08:17,411 --> 00:08:18,244
go away.

395
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,350
I can't walk away from a table.

396
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,753
That's my weakness.

397
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:26,570
I don't know how to walk away if I have
a dollar or 10 grand fucking blow your

398
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,330
special brain chemistry,

399
00:08:28,331 --> 00:08:29,164
whatever it is in Europe.

400
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:29,771
For me,

401
00:08:29,771 --> 00:08:31,630
that's my gambling comes up.

402
00:08:31,631 --> 00:08:32,830
You just being loved.

403
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:36,640
That's my ultimate way of
shoving it to the man and like,

404
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:37,540
I'm better than you.

405
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:38,410
I can do this.

406
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,060
And I know it's,

407
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:39,893
for me,

408
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:40,960
it's the self worth thing.

409
00:08:40,961 --> 00:08:41,860
I was looking for self worth.

410
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:42,521
So again,

411
00:08:42,521 --> 00:08:44,530
but how do you get so
forth that it began for me?

412
00:08:44,531 --> 00:08:45,131
That's where it went,

413
00:08:45,131 --> 00:08:45,400
man.

414
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:45,571
That,

415
00:08:45,571 --> 00:08:46,720
I mean for you you might get,

416
00:08:46,721 --> 00:08:46,871
I mean,

417
00:08:46,871 --> 00:08:47,890
where do you get yourself worth?

418
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:48,610
I don't Dunno.

419
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:49,061
I get it.

420
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:49,810
Try not to think about it.

421
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:49,961
Yeah,

422
00:08:49,961 --> 00:08:52,870
my new thing now it's like I really know
that I'm making a difference on these

423
00:08:52,871 --> 00:08:53,704
podcasts,

424
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,431
so I dig that.

425
00:08:54,431 --> 00:08:55,170
I'm starting to get it.

426
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:56,680
That's where I'm getting my rough go.

427
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,020
Five decisions away,

428
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:00,360
five decisions of where and
when and what is essentially,

429
00:09:00,361 --> 00:09:00,990
what does it well,

430
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:01,501
it's about,

431
00:09:01,501 --> 00:09:03,780
it just recounts all my mistakes.

432
00:09:03,781 --> 00:09:07,020
Over the last 15 years I
was doing a hoarder's where
in New York City where this

433
00:09:07,021 --> 00:09:08,450
guy had a mass,

434
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,080
he had an acre in Brooklyn,

435
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:11,730
a massive property in Brooklyn.

436
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,410
This guy inherited it
from his dad and it was,

437
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,440
had about six feet of bicycles
all the way through the yard.

438
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,940
So an acre at six feet high.

439
00:09:17,941 --> 00:09:18,481
Think of the metal,

440
00:09:18,481 --> 00:09:22,440
the value of that metal was probably a
hundred grand and metal and he had a bum

441
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:24,030
living in his yard.

442
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,290
So inside the hoard,

443
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:28,830
there was a bum living there and that
was one of the things we had to clean up.

444
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,730
We have to get rid of the bum.

445
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:30,870
So I was literally,

446
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:31,890
I mean this was two years ago,

447
00:09:31,891 --> 00:09:32,581
I'm sitting here in,

448
00:09:32,581 --> 00:09:33,060
uh,

449
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,210
in Brooklyn hanging out with this bum.

450
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:35,881
His name is Gregory.

451
00:09:35,881 --> 00:09:36,714
I'll never forget him.

452
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:37,561
And I was like,

453
00:09:37,561 --> 00:09:38,610
and this is the cool thing about hoarders.

454
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:39,630
I get to meet Delis dudes.

455
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:40,471
And I was like,

456
00:09:40,471 --> 00:09:40,841
all right Greg,

457
00:09:40,841 --> 00:09:41,160
your head,

458
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:41,761
you end up here man.

459
00:09:41,761 --> 00:09:42,594
Cause he had,

460
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:42,841
I mean,

461
00:09:42,841 --> 00:09:43,800
he had a bunch of,

462
00:09:43,801 --> 00:09:45,180
like a 40 ounces,

463
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,253
he had a bunch of,

464
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:47,790
a bunch of these magnum condoms.

465
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:48,624
And so I was like,

466
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,321
fuck yeah,

467
00:09:49,321 --> 00:09:50,700
this guy's getting more acid than I am.

468
00:09:50,701 --> 00:09:52,140
And he lives in a chicken shack.

469
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,083
You know,

470
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,061
he was huffing.

471
00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:54,860
I didn't realize it was hot.

472
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,070
He was just huffing gasoline,

473
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:57,230
huffing gasoline.

474
00:09:57,231 --> 00:09:57,430
Yeah.

475
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:57,900
Condoms.

476
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:58,171
Yeah.

477
00:09:58,171 --> 00:09:59,550
They would fill up the condoms and then,

478
00:09:59,600 --> 00:09:59,730
uh,

479
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,980
with the fumes and thought
he was getting asked.

480
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:03,270
I didn't really just trying to get high.

481
00:10:03,271 --> 00:10:04,290
She kicked me in the nuts.

482
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:08,180
A job that must keep you grounded in,

483
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,680
in like other possibilities of reality,

484
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:11,970
not necessarily your reality,

485
00:10:11,971 --> 00:10:13,980
but the pony was ever in this.

486
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:14,361
That's the,

487
00:10:14,361 --> 00:10:17,130
that's what we came with
five decisions away because,

488
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:17,671
uh,

489
00:10:17,671 --> 00:10:18,120
back to it,

490
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:18,930
we need finished it,

491
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:20,580
that bum sitting in the yard.

492
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,530
I asked him how he got there and he goes,

493
00:10:22,531 --> 00:10:22,681
oh,

494
00:10:22,681 --> 00:10:23,610
I was a stockbroker.

495
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:24,211
And I was like,

496
00:10:24,211 --> 00:10:25,010
get outta here.

497
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:25,590
Whoa.

498
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:25,981
And I'm like,

499
00:10:25,981 --> 00:10:26,311
he's there,

500
00:10:26,311 --> 00:10:27,510
he's full of shit or this is real.

501
00:10:27,511 --> 00:10:28,230
So I went with it,

502
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:28,830
you know,

503
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:29,161
and I was like,

504
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:30,270
what do you mean you were striking?

505
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:30,480
He goes,

506
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,090
I was a stockbroker and a girl
broke my heart and they go,

507
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:36,120
you're telling me you're living in this
guy's yard because a girl broke your

508
00:10:36,121 --> 00:10:36,810
heart.

509
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,520
He was willing got addicted to crack too.

510
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:42,060
But the girl broke my
heart and I was like,

511
00:10:42,061 --> 00:10:42,181
yeah,

512
00:10:42,181 --> 00:10:42,751
the crack plan.

513
00:10:42,751 --> 00:10:43,740
Have something to do with it.

514
00:10:43,741 --> 00:10:44,070
Yeah.

515
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:45,630
But he lived in a fucking shack.

516
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,040
And so I looked at the camera and I go,

517
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:50,070
I guess we are all really s five
decisions away from shitting in a bucket.

518
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:50,640
Yeah.

519
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,150
Wow.

520
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,350
And that just stuck.

521
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:53,880
And when I said that people ran with it,

522
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,260
and I'm clearly five,

523
00:10:55,261 --> 00:10:57,600
had many five decisions away
from shitting in a bucket.

524
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,330
And I mean,

525
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:00,840
couple things different happened and
I in my life could've been totally

526
00:11:00,841 --> 00:11:01,260
different.

527
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,640
It might not be any five,

528
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:04,380
it could be one if it's a bad one.

529
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:11,780
[inaudible].
