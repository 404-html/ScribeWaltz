1
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:06,580
And we're live.
What's up Joe?

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,410
Man,
I'm pumped to be here.

3
00:00:08,411 --> 00:00:11,890
I'm like a little kid here right now.
Myelin around and loving it.

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:12,670
Well,
I'm excited.

5
00:00:12,671 --> 00:00:15,460
There's a big gloria event this Friday 
in Los Angeles.

6
00:00:15,461 --> 00:00:16,910
I'll be there.
And um,

7
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,850
it's a.
You got two world titles,

8
00:00:18,851 --> 00:00:19,840
right?
Nah.

9
00:00:19,841 --> 00:00:21,310
Yeah.
Two is the two world titles.

10
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,360
He advised Israel,
Israel Edison.

11
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:26,420
And yet that's a wicked fight.
The good fight.

12
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:31,500
And then you're looking at that.
Matt embry and other Canadian kid 

13
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,500
against that Dutch beast.
Robin van small and.

14
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:33,520
Oh yeah,
that's right.

15
00:00:33,521 --> 00:00:36,090
That's right.
That's going to be a on UFC fight pass.

16
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:37,100
Yes.
Yeah.

17
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:41,590
I'm so psyched that the UFC and UFC 
fight pass is embracing glory.

18
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,980
It's super exciting for me.
I think so.

19
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:44,930
And it was that,
uh,

20
00:00:44,931 --> 00:00:49,931
that huge collision card in Germany.
You had rico versus butter and UFC ran 

21
00:00:49,931 --> 00:00:50,320
that pay per view for us.

22
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:51,300
Oh really?
Yeah.

23
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:56,310
No kidding.
That was the first time the UFC has run 

24
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:58,711
anything other than UFC.
That's for us as a big accomplishment 

25
00:00:58,751 --> 00:01:00,070
for kickboxing.
Well,

26
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:01,660
we know we've talked about in this 
podcast,

27
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:03,220
we were just talking about it a couple 
minutes ago.

28
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:08,640
I think kickboxing,
especially high level kickboxing like 

29
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,270
glory is one of the most exciting sports
in the world and it perplexes me and 

30
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,020
many other people.
Why it's not more exciting.

31
00:01:14,021 --> 00:01:16,400
Crazy because it's not hard to 
understand what's going on.

32
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:20,800
Like one of the things about mma that is
very important to me.

33
00:01:20,801 --> 00:01:22,150
It's like when the fight to go to the 
ground,

34
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:27,600
I have to explain step by step what's 
going on because otherwise people that 

35
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,501
don't know ground fighting the all of a 
sudden like why is he tapping what's 

36
00:01:31,501 --> 00:01:32,560
going on?
Like you don't see exactly what's going,

37
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:35,440
but when someone explains it to you,
you see it with kickboxing,

38
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:36,550
it's pretty obvious.

39
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:38,560
Pretty obvious kicks and punches and 
knees.

40
00:01:38,561 --> 00:01:40,060
Yeah.
Just so people are getting smashed.

41
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:41,770
I Dunno,
I don't get it.

42
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:44,980
I seriously don't understand.
Dana white has a really good theory.

43
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:50,310
He thinks that PKA karate from like you 
remember the 19 eighties when they used 

44
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,991
to have those pka karate matches on espn
for the karate pants and the big booties

45
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:00,720
on their feet don't sit around and yeah,
it was really just sloppy boxing with 

46
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,810
like some shitty kicks,
but that's even American kickboxing.

47
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:07,840
It's like they have a kick rule.
So what would happen and they would 

48
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,351
throw eight kicks in the beginning of 
the round and then all of a sudden they 

49
00:02:10,351 --> 00:02:10,351
boxed for the rest of the round.
Exactly.

50
00:02:10,351 --> 00:02:10,960
Yeah,
exactly.

51
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,840
And for whatever reason above the waist 
as well,

52
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:18,220
which I think one of the things about 
kickboxing as opposed to the traditional

53
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:20,110
martial arts or like taekwondo or 
karate,

54
00:02:20,111 --> 00:02:22,420
it's like as soon as you start adding 
leg kicks,

55
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,400
like it changes the whole game.

56
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,410
It's a totally different game.
It changes everything.

57
00:02:26,411 --> 00:02:31,411
And we were talking before this fight 
about your fight for this podcast were 

58
00:02:31,411 --> 00:02:31,510
either about your fight with Raymond 
Daniels,

59
00:02:31,511 --> 00:02:33,250
which is one of my favorite fights ever.
Thank you.

60
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:38,340
Because he is this traditional karate 
guy who was a point fighting champion 

61
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,431
and he has wicked kicks.
He's just one of the most spectacular 

62
00:02:42,431 --> 00:02:46,021
and dynamic guys and kickboxing,
but your leg kicks and your constant 

63
00:02:46,021 --> 00:02:49,480
pressure and just rock solid Moitai 
fundamentals.

64
00:02:49,481 --> 00:02:51,190
You just chopped them down,
chopped them down,

65
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,810
and then eventually had kicked him.
Yeah,

66
00:02:52,811 --> 00:02:57,811
it's that movement.
Fighters are very tricky and I think 

67
00:02:57,811 --> 00:02:58,930
what made that fight super exciting was 
that old school ufc mentality.

68
00:02:58,931 --> 00:03:00,220
You two different arts,

69
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:02,470
you know,
battling to see which one was better.

70
00:03:02,471 --> 00:03:07,471
And Raymond Daniels was undefeated.
He was just knocking people out with 

71
00:03:07,471 --> 00:03:08,050
spinning hoecakes every time he was 
fighting.

72
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,130
So,
you know,

73
00:03:09,131 --> 00:03:10,240
as a,
as a smart,

74
00:03:10,241 --> 00:03:12,100
intelligent fighter,
you got to put pressure.

75
00:03:12,101 --> 00:03:14,800
And I remember we had a conversation 
about,

76
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:17,170
you know,
guys like a wonder Boy Thompson,

77
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:21,430
why isn't his opponents calling someone 
like me to do it?

78
00:03:21,431 --> 00:03:26,431
But you had a good point.
It takes a special fighter to really 

79
00:03:26,431 --> 00:03:30,120
close distance and pressure like that 
and to be able to execute a game plan 

80
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,111
with heavy low kicks like that.
So you have to really have a high level 

81
00:03:34,111 --> 00:03:37,681
more tie game to deal with a guy like 
wonder boy the same way because we'll 

82
00:03:37,681 --> 00:03:39,760
wonder boys also real unusual in his use
of the front leg,

83
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:45,150
like he is that sideways stance kind of 
upends a little at the waist and throws 

84
00:03:45,551 --> 00:03:50,551
all those wicked front leg side kicks,
round kicks and on top of that he's a 

85
00:03:50,551 --> 00:03:50,551
really good punch her.

86
00:03:50,551 --> 00:03:51,940
And He's good.
He's impressive.

87
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,820
Yeah.
It's the rematch is happening,

88
00:03:54,821 --> 00:03:55,570
isn't it?
With woodleigh?

89
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:56,290
Yeah.
Yeah.

90
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:58,540
It's going to be in March in Vegas.
That's going to be crazy.

91
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,980
Yeah,
that's a good rematch.

92
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:05,160
It is a good rematch.
Especially because Woodley was 

93
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,041
dominating that first round with his 
wrestling and really never took them 

94
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:08,041
down again.
So I was like,

95
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:08,230
wow,
this is crazy.

96
00:04:08,231 --> 00:04:10,570
Like I wonder why he didn't take them 
down and I asked him after the fight,

97
00:04:10,571 --> 00:04:15,571
he goes,
I have no idea why I didn't take them 

98
00:04:15,571 --> 00:04:15,571
down.
Okay.

99
00:04:15,571 --> 00:04:15,571
So it was just,
he was just in the moment.

100
00:04:15,571 --> 00:04:16,810
It's loving event.
It's loving the moment.

101
00:04:16,811 --> 00:04:18,160
Loving the experience.
Yeah.

102
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:23,290
It's exciting.
So you now have taken some time off from

103
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:25,540
fighting because of concussions.
That's right.

104
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,940
And tell me about that.
So yeah,

105
00:04:27,941 --> 00:04:29,980
it was actually,
I think you were at my last fight.

106
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,990
It was a,
I fought mark the bond,

107
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:33,160
you know,
rest in peace.

108
00:04:33,161 --> 00:04:34,770
I remember we talked about the.
Yeah,

109
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,270
what happened?
Did they find out what happened to him?

110
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:42,390
I didn't know a lot of the stuff is 
coming out is in Dutch and Dutch 

111
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,220
newspapers and I'm asking all of the 
Dutch community kind of what's happening

112
00:04:43,221 --> 00:04:45,670
and they don't really know.
You hear different things and rumors,

113
00:04:45,671 --> 00:04:48,250
but I don't want to listen to rumors 
that I don't want to hear it from like a

114
00:04:48,251 --> 00:04:53,251
concrete source and went missing and 
then they found his body and they 

115
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:54,370
basically found his body.
Yeah.

116
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,880
So why or who knows?
But he was great.

117
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,740
He was amazing.
Excellent,

118
00:04:59,741 --> 00:05:01,060
excellent fighter,
you know.

119
00:05:01,061 --> 00:05:02,440
And uh,
he was another guy,

120
00:05:02,441 --> 00:05:03,150
but boy,
you know,

121
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,650
you look at him,
he looked like a computer programmer.

122
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:07,990
You know what I mean?
Like it's,

123
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:08,890
it's,
uh,

124
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:11,370
it's interesting how it looks can be so 
deceiving.

125
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,150
It's super,
super high level guy.

126
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:18,420
Yeah.
But that was my last fight and I'm from 

127
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:21,901
there was actually a really tough.
I never really opened up about it to be 

128
00:05:21,901 --> 00:05:22,930
honest with you.
And it was a very tough experience.

129
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:23,560
Um,
you know,

130
00:05:23,561 --> 00:05:25,660
you got to think I just win the world 
title.

131
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:29,710
I'm going home to Canada,
which my concussion was pretty bad where

132
00:05:29,711 --> 00:05:32,710
I shouldn't have even gone on a plane 
home and next thing you know,

133
00:05:32,711 --> 00:05:35,230
I'm at home and just the concussions got
really bad.

134
00:05:35,231 --> 00:05:38,610
I had to be hospitalized for a few days 
and uh,

135
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,760
I was in a dark room for three weeks,
then I could knock it out of a dark room

136
00:05:42,761 --> 00:05:44,110
for three weeks.
I couldn't walk.

137
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:49,470
Um,
I guess something with the concussion 

138
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:51,281
started causing some neuron now.
Nervous nerve damage that could be 

139
00:05:53,381 --> 00:05:55,230
amazing.
One of us concussion,

140
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:56,190
nerve damage and effects.

141
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:01,200
I was like in a bad man.
Couldn't even look out at a little red 

142
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:01,550
light on my phone.
Charger was too much.

143
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,110
Really?
That was bad.

144
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,330
It light on the phone charger would hurt
your head.

145
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,670
I couldn't even look at a thing.
So it was at that point,

146
00:06:07,671 --> 00:06:08,390
it was like,
man,

147
00:06:08,391 --> 00:06:13,391
it's like I just win this world title 
and it was a really tough time and this 

148
00:06:13,391 --> 00:06:13,760
is actually the first time I've really 
opened up about it,

149
00:06:13,761 --> 00:06:16,460
but it was a tough experience.
And being in that,

150
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:21,900
you know,
downstate where you're basically in a 

151
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:21,900
dark room for three weeks.
Um,

152
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,820
doctors were just,
you know,

153
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:29,020
handy me over shit ton of percosets and 
oxies to kind of deal with the pain.

154
00:06:29,091 --> 00:06:31,220
And it was,
it was a tough time man.

155
00:06:31,221 --> 00:06:36,221
And it really,
I think what was the hardest was what 

156
00:06:36,221 --> 00:06:36,221
was happening mentally.

157
00:06:36,221 --> 00:06:36,221
I'm sitting there and being like,
man,

158
00:06:36,221 --> 00:06:37,640
I just want a world that I want to get 
back in there.

159
00:06:37,641 --> 00:06:42,641
I want to know do so much in this sport.
And my goal was to be a legend in the 

160
00:06:42,641 --> 00:06:43,200
sport and,
but,

161
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:48,310
you know,
and then it got to the point I saw my 

162
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:48,530
family and how much it was affecting my 
family and that's when I decided that,

163
00:06:48,531 --> 00:06:51,290
you know what,
let's put this unrest for a little bit.

164
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:54,950
So you win the fight and after the fight
is over,

165
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:57,770
was it immediately that you knew 
something was wrong?

166
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,380
It honestly,
I had some adrenaline rush and I did the

167
00:07:00,381 --> 00:07:03,140
post fight press conference.
Everything was fine.

168
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:08,640
I was just when I got back to the hotel 
room and I was throwing up and couldn't 

169
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,700
leave my room and I was surprised that 
even got on an airplane home,

170
00:07:10,701 --> 00:07:13,670
the doctors in Canada or like how the 
heck did you get on an airplane home?

171
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:19,660
So it was scary times man and,
and it took a lot of good mental 

172
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,230
strength to get out of it.
And now I'm actually in a,

173
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:24,020
in a position where I'm super happy and 
I'm loving it.

174
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,170
I got that whole color commentary role 
with Gloria,

175
00:07:27,171 --> 00:07:29,870
which has been incredible because that's
great.

176
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,310
It's great that you found a way out of 
it.

177
00:07:31,311 --> 00:07:36,311
But man,
I would imagine that when you were in 

178
00:07:36,311 --> 00:07:36,311
that dark room and you couldn't even 
look at the light on a charger,

179
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:39,230
that must've been really,
really,

180
00:07:39,231 --> 00:07:44,231
really uncomfortable to deal with.
It was tough and I know another like 

181
00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:46,370
it's just the way of how can I explain 
it if it gets emotional sometimes,

182
00:07:46,371 --> 00:07:51,371
you know,
it was a time where it was like I 

183
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:53,261
finally achieved what I wanted and no 
one has really gotten to that level and 

184
00:07:53,601 --> 00:07:56,870
the time that I did before I turned pro,
I only had 11 amateur fights.

185
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:00,890
I only had 11 amateur fights and right 
away into the pro ranks,

186
00:08:00,891 --> 00:08:05,891
they only had 14 professional fights.
So you gotta think in 25 fights I was 

187
00:08:05,891 --> 00:08:10,601
able to get in there,
become a professional win the world 

188
00:08:10,601 --> 00:08:11,810
title in the biggest kickboxing 
organization,

189
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,780
all within 25 fights.
Amateur professional combined.

190
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,400
And how old were you when you won the 
title?

191
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,650
Twenty eight.
So you're still young.

192
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,140
I'm 31 right now.
But think about that.

193
00:08:21,141 --> 00:08:24,650
You know the amount of fights you had.
Not that many in comparison.

194
00:08:24,651 --> 00:08:26,780
A lot of these Dutch guys,
I'd have 100 plus fights.

195
00:08:26,781 --> 00:08:29,510
All the Thai guys that have more.
It's crazy to think.

196
00:08:29,511 --> 00:08:32,240
Yeah,
I think it's just bad luck sometimes and

197
00:08:32,241 --> 00:08:37,241
my style was a style that was really.
It meant you could watch any one of my 

198
00:08:37,241 --> 00:08:37,880
fights and you're going to be 
entertained.

199
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,850
And I,
I understood the value of,

200
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,530
you know,
it's more than just a sport.

201
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:43,940
You GotTa win,
you got a dominant,

202
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:45,620
you gotta be exciting.
Um,

203
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:48,030
I think that's what I really did in my 
career and that's what I,

204
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:51,200
I got such a huge following behind me 
and you know,

205
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,080
it's just,
it was sucked because I had more,

206
00:08:54,081 --> 00:08:55,530
I want it to show,
put it that way.

207
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:00,800
Now when you see a guy like mayweather 
who's gone through a career and he's 

208
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,730
like 49 and o and is probably one of the
best,

209
00:09:02,731 --> 00:09:05,400
if not the best defensive fighters of 
all time.

210
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:08,010
And then you see what you went through 
with your situation.

211
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,410
Do you,
do you look at a guy like mayweather and

212
00:09:10,411 --> 00:09:11,400
say,
men may be,

213
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:16,730
maybe I should take a different approach
or maybe I should have taken a more 

214
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:20,571
safety first approach.
I'm torn between that because at one 

215
00:09:20,571 --> 00:09:20,780
point,
uh,

216
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,560
if that's floyd mayweather,
right?

217
00:09:22,561 --> 00:09:26,520
And you're looking at a guy who makes 
multimillions of fight and um,

218
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,830
you know,
he has that,

219
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:33,850
a support around them and whether it's a
boring fight and most people who watch 

220
00:09:34,631 --> 00:09:37,170
the casual fans who watch floyd 
mayweather think he's boring.

221
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:38,280
Right?
Right.

222
00:09:38,281 --> 00:09:43,281
But really,
if you're a skilled fighter and you 

223
00:09:43,281 --> 00:09:45,291
understand what he's doing,
you understand how incredible of an 

224
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:45,291
athlete he is.
A,

225
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:46,380
but I was just thrown in there with the 
wolves men.

226
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:48,360
It was kind of like,
hey,

227
00:09:48,361 --> 00:09:52,410
you're fighting a cream Gaji in your 
third glory fight.

228
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:57,590
Um,
it's only as hundreds of professional 

229
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:57,590
flight.
And that's my,

230
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:57,870
that's my eight.
So what do I do?

231
00:09:57,871 --> 00:10:00,300
Do I play the point games with someone 
who's been in that ring?

232
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:03,330
Probably had 100 amateur fights,
100 professional fights.

233
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,190
What do I do?
So again,

234
00:10:05,191 --> 00:10:08,400
I have to go in there.
I got to build a name for myself.

235
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:13,460
You gotta think Canada,
there's no professional fighting in 

236
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:13,460
Ontario,
Canada,

237
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,040
where I'm from.
So there's no professional fighting.

238
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:19,100
I had no experience.
So my approach was I got to bring the 

239
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:19,100
heat to these guys.
Wow.

240
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:24,110
I got to bring the heat,
I got to be exciting and I got to 

241
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:24,110
finish,
just turned into a brawl.

242
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:25,170
Just turn it in,
but again,

243
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,830
I wouldn't use this as people always 
say,

244
00:10:28,831 --> 00:10:30,090
oh,
you're in Brawley or aggressive,

245
00:10:30,091 --> 00:10:30,530
like,
Nah,

246
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,140
I'm a technician and actually when I'm 
coming forward and I'm stocking you,

247
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:39,290
I'm waiting to counter kick him.
You went in to use my low kicks and 

248
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:39,290
waiting a county,
so it's very calculated.

249
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:40,320
I wouldn't say Berlin.
Yeah.

250
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:45,740
That's probably not the right word,
but you turn them into very violent 

251
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:45,870
encounters always.
Yeah,

252
00:10:45,871 --> 00:10:49,380
always.
Now when you watch high level kickboxing

253
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:52,830
like glory and then you see what's going
on in mma,

254
00:10:52,831 --> 00:10:55,920
where I think the level of striking is 
certainly advancing.

255
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:57,330
You're getting better and better 
strikers,

256
00:10:57,331 --> 00:11:02,331
but it's really not at the same level 
that you're seeing in like world 

257
00:11:02,331 --> 00:11:02,710
champion kickboxing.
Yeah.

258
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,800
It's totally different and people can 
understand.

259
00:11:04,801 --> 00:11:08,520
It's a totally different sport.
The way you would fight in kickboxing,

260
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,560
you're not going to fight the same way 
in mma begging me.

261
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:16,840
There's take downs and there's a lot of 
very successful kickboxers who don't do 

262
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:21,261
well in mma a lot don't because they 
keep that traditional Thai stance where 

263
00:11:21,261 --> 00:11:25,311
they stand very tall and they're 
fighting very tall and of course the 

264
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:28,731
rest is going to take you down.
I'm an example of a good Canadian 

265
00:11:28,951 --> 00:11:30,450
strikers,
Shane Campbell,

266
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:35,990
Shane Campbell,
one of the fights in the UFC and he's 

267
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:38,211
got an incredible background in Moitai,
but he stays true to sometimes a little 

268
00:11:38,211 --> 00:11:40,620
too much to his Moitai roots on the 
striking.

269
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,690
You got to keep your hips back,
you got to move.

270
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,000
It's a totally different game.
You got a four ounce glove,

271
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,890
not an eight ounce gloves,
so shit changes.

272
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:52,040
Yeah.
It also affects your offense to when 

273
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:52,040
you're worried about take downs,
you're worried about all these different

274
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,350
aspects of.
Yeah.

275
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,130
The clinch,

276
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,120
the cage,
you know.

277
00:11:55,121 --> 00:11:56,740
Have you ever fought in a cage,
A.

278
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,540
No.
We've been debating a lot lately.

279
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:03,541
I talk way too much about it.
People getting annoyed because I think 

280
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:03,541
that they should do it on like a 
basketball court.

281
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:07,150
I really think fight should take place 
on a large surface with no obstacles,

282
00:12:07,151 --> 00:12:10,570
no nothing other than the fighters 
themselves.

283
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,910
Did you like the pride ring over the 
octagon or.

284
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:15,100
No?
I think rings are dangerous.

285
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:17,690
Like you started the Bernard Hopkins,
Joe Smith Jr.

286
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,920
Yeah,
I mean that's a good example.

287
00:12:20,921 --> 00:12:25,921
WhY think rings are dangerous.
It's not often that that happens where 

288
00:12:25,921 --> 00:12:29,341
guys get knocked through the ropes,
but It does happen and in pride I think,

289
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,010
you know,
they,

290
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,400
they did a good job of standing outside 
the ring.

291
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:38,430
Like the pride organization was good 
where they had a bunch of guys waiting 

292
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:38,430
to catch people.
It's still weird.

293
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:39,790
It shouldn't have to come down to.
Exactly.

294
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:41,560
Exactly.
But I get it for mma,

295
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:46,561
but for like a kickboxing,
I can't really see it being done in the 

296
00:12:46,561 --> 00:12:46,561
cage.
I know.

297
00:12:46,561 --> 00:12:47,630
I think you had them on john wayne par.
Yes.

298
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:48,150
Yeah,
he does.

299
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,960
Caged moitai yeah.
Yeah.

300
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,040
What,
what's your thoughts on that?

301
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:51,940
Well,
he loves it,

302
00:12:51,941 --> 00:12:53,710
you know,
and he does it with mma gloves too.

303
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:56,530
That's dangerous.
But then you're putting good strikers on

304
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,320
without a takedown.
That's dangerous.

305
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,780
It's a different.
It's totally different thing,

306
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:06,810
you know,
I mean it's a totally different thing 

307
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:06,810
with those little gloves too,
right?

308
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:09,670
Yeah.
Have you done any fighting with little 

309
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:09,670
gloves?
No.

310
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,701
I was actually planning to fight a few 
times because before glory there was 

311
00:13:11,701 --> 00:13:11,701
nothing.
Uh,

312
00:13:11,701 --> 00:13:12,640
you got to look.
There was originally,

313
00:13:12,641 --> 00:13:16,240
it was k one and k one only had a 
lightweight division and the heavyweight

314
00:13:16,241 --> 00:13:16,690
division.

315
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:19,600
So everyone in between kind of have to 
kind of pick away.

316
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:25,470
I actually fought in la.
It was against a ufc fighter many 

317
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:26,290
baghdad.
Okay.

318
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:30,010
So I fought many baghdad in la and it 
was just,

319
00:13:30,011 --> 00:13:35,011
I tried making for the first time one 60
and it was a guy to walk around.

320
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:41,030
Uh,
well my non fighting walk round about 

321
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:41,030
200,
uh,

322
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:43,000
when I was fighting,
but one 91 95.

323
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:45,710
So you're trying to lose 30 plus pounds.
Yeah,

324
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,690
it was.
It sucked.

325
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,330
But I think,
I think that's the other thing.

326
00:13:49,331 --> 00:13:54,331
Mma guys knoW how to cut weight a little
better than kickboxers do its thing 

327
00:13:54,331 --> 00:13:56,830
that's at wrestling.
Growing up with that wrestling helps,

328
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:02,240
but I think it's more dangerous with,
well I know it's more dangerous with 

329
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,901
striking than it is with wrestling and 
that's one of the problems with that 

330
00:14:06,901 --> 00:14:08,110
wrestling mentor brain.
your brain's dehydrated.

331
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,280
Yeah.
But see the,

332
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:14,300
the advantage in mma of being bigger,
it's not the same as the advantage of 

333
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,090
being bigger and striking because being 
bigger and striking is,

334
00:14:16,091 --> 00:14:18,850
is important.
It's definitely a factor,

335
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:24,270
but it's so much more of a factor when 
you're clenching so much more of a 

336
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,690
factor when you take guys down,
you lose a little bit of speed sometimes

337
00:14:25,691 --> 00:14:27,050
and that mobility.
Yeah.

338
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,150
Yeah.
Um,

339
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:33,360
so when you were,
when you thinking about sparring with 

340
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:33,360
little gloves,
what,

341
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,890
what differences did you notice or think
about fighting with little gloves?

342
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:40,580
It was more about moving more and I 
coach a lot of mma guys and um,

343
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,470
I actually got to work in the ufc.
I got to the corner twice in the ufc,

344
00:14:44,471 --> 00:14:49,471
which was pretty cool.
I had mitch gagnon and I got to corner 

345
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:49,740
antonio carvallo who was mentioned 
fighting.

346
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,320
Um,
when he fought,

347
00:14:51,321 --> 00:14:51,980
he fought.

348
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,110
Um,
uh,

349
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:56,510
I have to dig deep here,
a young kid,

350
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:59,660
I want to say he was hawaiian,
maybe knocked him out.

351
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:01,790
I helped trained him for he fought 
while,

352
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:05,800
well watson non demo with a left hook.
Um,

353
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:11,230
who was that other kid that he fought,
but my last antonio fight was against 

354
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:13,080
derek.
Darren elkins was,

355
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,890
that was one of those fights where 
antonio got caught,

356
00:15:15,891 --> 00:15:20,891
drop pop back up and uh,
even being called that off and we're 

357
00:15:20,891 --> 00:15:20,891
like,
ah,

358
00:15:20,891 --> 00:15:22,340
like it was an early stoppage.
But yeah,

359
00:15:22,341 --> 00:15:27,341
he's protecting antonio.
So it's interesting that a guy like you 

360
00:15:27,341 --> 00:15:31,330
who is very high level world champion 
kickboxer learning how to fight and move

361
00:15:32,241 --> 00:15:37,241
with the small mma gloves.
It kind of shows you that striking in 

362
00:15:37,241 --> 00:15:40,721
particular with a mma striking is still 
learning growing food for sure because 

363
00:15:42,171 --> 00:15:45,860
guys like you come in and you are like 
guys like duke roufus,

364
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:50,861
a former world champion himself was 
really good at training guys and 

365
00:15:50,861 --> 00:15:51,680
teaching guys duane ludwig's doing a 
good job.

366
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,910
perfect example.
Yeah.

367
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,000
And it's,
there's so many different methods and so

368
00:15:56,001 --> 00:15:58,490
many different styles that people were 
trying to incorporate.

369
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:03,940
I just think it's fighting is I think 
people focus fighting the way I look at 

370
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:08,591
fighting.
It's not actually what you throw and I 

371
00:16:08,591 --> 00:16:10,961
always get questioned what's a good 
coach versus a bad coach and a good 

372
00:16:10,961 --> 00:16:15,701
coach is going to teach you positioning.
Distance is going to tell you more of 

373
00:16:16,221 --> 00:16:21,221
the philosophies and strategies around 
finding where there's so many coaches 

374
00:16:21,221 --> 00:16:23,530
and with mma being so popular,
there's every,

375
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:28,610
every,
every other corner has an mma gym and 

376
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:31,031
these guys are basically putting these 
fighters on pads and they're just 

377
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:31,160
getting them tired.
Jab,

378
00:16:31,161 --> 00:16:31,520
cross,
hook,

379
00:16:31,521 --> 00:16:31,880
kick,
jab,

380
00:16:31,881 --> 00:16:32,270
cross,
hook,

381
00:16:32,271 --> 00:16:37,271
kick,
more combination combination and they 

382
00:16:37,271 --> 00:16:37,271
get tired and they think tired equals 
good,

383
00:16:37,271 --> 00:16:39,200
where there's so much more to fighting.
Where's your distance control?

384
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,970
How are you moving,
you know,

385
00:16:40,971 --> 00:16:43,190
like what are your counters?
How are you countering?

386
00:16:43,191 --> 00:16:45,030
What are your defense?
people think there's a,

387
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,940
there's defense,
but there's different types of demons.

388
00:16:46,941 --> 00:16:48,890
You got head movement,
you got shield defense,

389
00:16:48,891 --> 00:16:50,960
you got footwork for your defense,
you know,

390
00:16:50,961 --> 00:16:53,390
you got perry.
So there's so many different ways,

391
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,910
but it does take good coaching in my 
opinion,

392
00:16:55,911 --> 00:17:00,911
to take these guys to that high 
professional level and there's not 

393
00:17:00,911 --> 00:17:00,911
enough of it.
Yeah,

394
00:17:00,911 --> 00:17:05,651
I agree.
And it's so hard for a young fighter to 

395
00:17:05,651 --> 00:17:05,780
find really solid coaching and when you 
start out,

396
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:10,160
you're really kind of lucky if you walk 
into a great gym your first time because

397
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:15,520
so few people,
especially in the beginning really know 

398
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,150
how to differentiate between a great gym
and just a regular gym.

399
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,100
It's very,
very difficult to tell.

400
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:20,660
It's hard.
it's hard.

401
00:17:20,661 --> 00:17:23,450
But back to your original question,
it's about mobility in my opinion.

402
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:26,480
A guys that have been made need to know 
how to move a little bit better.

403
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:31,930
Um,
I think footwork is one of the most 

404
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:32,840
important things in fighting him.
And you got to be able to adapt.

405
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:37,870
If you're fighting a pressure fighter,
you got to be able to move and fight on 

406
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:37,870
angles.
Um,

407
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:39,860
if you're fighting a guy who now likes 
to move a lot,

408
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:43,460
you got to be able to pressure fight,
so you have to have the coaching and the

409
00:17:43,461 --> 00:17:45,530
knowledge to be able to adapt 
accordingly.

410
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:50,130
Yeah,
and I think that a lot of people don't

411
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:53,370
see when you're watching kickboxing or 
you watching moitai,

412
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,670
you're seeing these guys are standing 
close to each other and they're throwing

413
00:17:56,671 --> 00:18:01,671
kicks and it's like,
it's hard to tell exactly why they're 

414
00:18:01,671 --> 00:18:04,530
doing what.
It's hard to tell exactly why one guy is

415
00:18:04,531 --> 00:18:09,531
more effective,
but once you see it and once you 

416
00:18:09,531 --> 00:18:12,951
practice it and once you do it,
then it all starts opening up like a 

417
00:18:12,951 --> 00:18:17,361
flower.
Now when a guy like you is doing 

418
00:18:17,361 --> 00:18:18,240
commentary,
it really helps because a guy who's been

419
00:18:18,241 --> 00:18:23,241
in there,
guys been a world champion and you get 

420
00:18:23,241 --> 00:18:23,280
to explain what this guy's probably 
thinking,

421
00:18:23,281 --> 00:18:25,380
what's going wrong.
And it sort of.

422
00:18:25,381 --> 00:18:26,850
I really liked your commentary,
man.

423
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,690
I been trying,
man.

424
00:18:27,691 --> 00:18:28,680
It's done great.
Turning.

425
00:18:28,681 --> 00:18:30,410
Thank you.
Coming from you,

426
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:35,830
your,
your explaining things in a way that's 

427
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,260
opening up the game to people.
It opens up the sport where you go,

428
00:18:37,261 --> 00:18:37,810
oh,
okay,

429
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,390
now I know what to look for.

430
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,180
Now I know what,
what trends are happening.

431
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:43,710
I'm trying to find the balance still.
I think that's a good.

432
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:48,740
I think that's one of my challenges.
If I come in there and I started 

433
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:48,740
talking,
uh,

434
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:48,740
you know,
his,

435
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:51,810
his left heel is about two inches,
which is causing this to happen and he's

436
00:18:51,811 --> 00:18:53,830
distance control is off.
You needs to slip off.

437
00:18:53,831 --> 00:18:55,470
They're like,
it's too much sometimes.

438
00:18:55,830 --> 00:19:00,830
So my challenge has been trying to kind 
of bring it down a little bit and try 

439
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:04,860
not to overly try to overeducate yeah,
that's been my challenge.

440
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:07,620
The other challenge is try not to use 
the same word all the time.

441
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:10,860
That's what a good left hook,
a big left hook.

442
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,420
Because I'm trying to change words,
man.

443
00:19:12,421 --> 00:19:15,840
I need a thesaurus beside me and just 
try to write shit down or something,

444
00:19:15,841 --> 00:19:16,420
man.
Oh,

445
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:21,200
I can tell you I've failed on all those 
exact same because talk too much.

446
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,610
Talk too much.
Say the same words too many times.

447
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:28,830
You call people to explosive and then 
like some people got mad for column 

448
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,180
explosive or athletically cockrum.
You only talk about black guys,

449
00:19:30,181 --> 00:19:31,650
you call them explosive and athletic.
I'm like,

450
00:19:31,651 --> 00:19:36,651
okay,
this is white guys that are explosive 

451
00:19:36,651 --> 00:19:38,601
and athletic too,
but you can't tell me that certain guys 

452
00:19:38,601 --> 00:19:38,601
aren't fucking explosive,
but how you deal with it.

453
00:19:38,601 --> 00:19:39,150
Do you okay with it now?
Like,

454
00:19:39,151 --> 00:19:41,070
I mean you probably.
It's been hard for me,

455
00:19:41,071 --> 00:19:46,071
man.
People come out and they take all your 

456
00:19:46,071 --> 00:19:46,071
words seriously.
Yeah.

457
00:19:46,071 --> 00:19:46,071
You go online and people are like,
ah,

458
00:19:46,071 --> 00:19:48,240
you fricking don't know shed and they're
talking crap.

459
00:19:48,241 --> 00:19:49,860
And I was Like,
well they can't say that.

460
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:55,310
Anybody who says that you don't know 
you're there and you're going to get 

461
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:55,310
that,
but I think they keep you on your toes,

462
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:55,830
man.
I really do.

463
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,020
I mean,
so I think for the most part,

464
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:03,180
the majority of respectful fans and they
might see something that maybe you don't

465
00:20:03,181 --> 00:20:08,181
know that you're doing that might be 
annoying and if it's annoying to them 

466
00:20:08,181 --> 00:20:08,181
it's annoying.
It might just.

467
00:20:08,181 --> 00:20:09,600
It might be only annoying to two percent
of the people,

468
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:14,840
but it might.
There might be a way where you could 

469
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,150
eliminate that aspect of your commentary
and I know I've worked hard at that.

470
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:18,480
I think it's good.
I think all the online criticism,

471
00:20:18,481 --> 00:20:21,150
as much as it's uncomfortable,
like a lot of it fucks.

472
00:20:21,151 --> 00:20:22,260
A lot of fighters.
Heads up,

473
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:23,700
man kills people.
You.

474
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,340
I've talked to a lot of guys,
coaches that were like,

475
00:20:26,341 --> 00:20:27,150
man,
those trolls,

476
00:20:27,151 --> 00:20:28,160
man,
they fucked with his head.

477
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:28,890
I'm like,
really?

478
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,400
And like,
yeah,

479
00:20:29,401 --> 00:20:32,400
he was always reading the comments and 
going on forums and can be dangerous.

480
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:37,890
That can be freaking dangerous.
I mean because you don't know who's 

481
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:38,670
making those things.
I mean that can be a 12 year old kid who

482
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:42,570
on adderall,
who's kicking his cat and you're reading

483
00:20:42,571 --> 00:20:46,680
this guy's words like as if it's gospel 
and you want to argue with them and guys

484
00:20:46,681 --> 00:20:47,980
get you don't know shit

485
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,170
and like fuck your mother,
but my mother,

486
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:54,550
you think about it.
It's harder than it.

487
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:58,690
I thought commentary was going to be an 
easier job than I thought,

488
00:20:58,691 --> 00:21:03,691
but it's.
I think it's harder than fighting right 

489
00:21:03,691 --> 00:21:04,570
now because it's still new to me.
I've only done 10 glory shows and um,

490
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:07,450
I don't think it's official yet,
but maybe I'll make it official here,

491
00:21:07,451 --> 00:21:09,790
but a glory signed me full time next 
year.

492
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:10,600
Oh,
that's awesome.

493
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:15,810
Glorious.
Had huge shows and do 18 shows next 

494
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:15,810
year.
Whoa.

495
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:17,290
And I don't know if I don't know how 
much you know about my life,

496
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:19,420
but I'm also a full time high school 
teacher.

497
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:21,130
You are.
No kidding.

498
00:21:21,131 --> 00:21:25,570
So literally my morning I teach phys ed.
I teach at a special education school,

499
00:21:25,571 --> 00:21:27,850
so I work with kids with special needs,
behaviors,

500
00:21:27,851 --> 00:21:30,100
autism.
So I teach phys ed to them.

501
00:21:30,101 --> 00:21:32,200
So that's nine,
nine slash eight.

502
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:33,430
What time do we start?
Eight 50.

503
00:21:33,431 --> 00:21:35,710
Five to 3:30.
Then from three,

504
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:40,711
I have an hour to eat my lunch or my 
dinner at that point and then I have my 

505
00:21:40,711 --> 00:21:40,711
own gym,
bazooka,

506
00:21:40,711 --> 00:21:42,910
kickboxing and mma.
And so you teach classes after that?

507
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,240
I train and I teach classes a couple of 
times we put,

508
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,730
we have a big broken.
I mentored her.

509
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:47,980
Jim's huge,
it's big,

510
00:21:47,981 --> 00:21:50,770
it's popular.
So it's nonstop.

511
00:21:50,771 --> 00:21:53,050
And then at night I go home and I have 
to do commentary.

512
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:56,350
what a bunch of lucky kids to have a guy
like you as a coach,

513
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:57,700
that's,
that's amazing,

514
00:21:57,701 --> 00:22:01,240
but I never really got to reach my full 
potential and all the things I wanted to

515
00:22:01,241 --> 00:22:04,000
do with kickboxing.
But this is where it's happening.

516
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:07,870
Glory having me full time allowed me to 
take a year leave from teaching.

517
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:09,700
And again,
if you look at my instagram,

518
00:22:09,701 --> 00:22:11,180
you could already see the difference 
man.

519
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,580
Um,
I want to educate people.

520
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:15,130
I want to get people hooked to glory 
hooked to this sport.

521
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,950
So I'm posting training videos,
training tips.

522
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:22,810
I got chris kamozi just a commented on 
one of my videos being like,

523
00:22:22,811 --> 00:22:24,160
hey man,
keep up the drilling.

524
00:22:24,161 --> 00:22:28,930
I loved the drills I had john mccain.
he just private messaged me saying like,

525
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:30,160
hey man,
good stuff.

526
00:22:30,161 --> 00:22:32,890
I've been following you.
So it's just getting that word out man.

527
00:22:32,891 --> 00:22:35,590
That kickboxing is the shed and gloria 
is where it's at.

528
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:40,920
yeah.
sometimes it's just a matter of staying 

529
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:40,920
the course and continuing to put out 
content and we've played a bunch of your

530
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,400
stuff on,
on has been huge.

531
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,400
You just posted something.
I just got like a,

532
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:48,220
almost a thousand new instagram likes 
and follows.

533
00:22:48,221 --> 00:22:49,030
So thank you.
Oh,

534
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:54,050
you're welcome brother.
So now that you are in this position as 

535
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:55,990
glory commentator and you've recovered 
from your concussion,

536
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:58,210
do you have any thoughts in your head of
fighting?

537
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,980
Again,
to be honest,

538
00:22:59,981 --> 00:23:02,560
there's more money doing commentary than
there is in the ring.

539
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:06,370
And that's where kickboxing,
it's still that there's still not enough

540
00:23:06,371 --> 00:23:11,371
finances to make it worth.
But it also comes down to is any money 

541
00:23:11,371 --> 00:23:14,350
worth health at that point?
You can make $10,000,000

542
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:19,351
a fight,
but if you don't remember that fight 

543
00:23:19,351 --> 00:23:19,351
after and you don't recover from brain 
injuries again,

544
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,060
what do you do?
I was having this conversation with some

545
00:23:22,061 --> 00:23:23,380
guys this week,
um,

546
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:28,440
that are not fighters.
And they were asking me about a certain 

547
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,620
fights where people got knocked out and 
you know,

548
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:30,680
how come,
you know,

549
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:31,940
when they came back,
you know,

550
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:36,160
they weren't as good.
And my take on It was you never know how

551
00:23:36,161 --> 00:23:41,161
someone's going to recover from a loss.
You don't know physically and your case 

552
00:23:41,161 --> 00:23:42,730
is a perfect example.
we're talking about a fight you want,

553
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:46,040
where you won the world title.
We dIdn't get knocked and he got

554
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:51,040
knocked down but not knocked out and you
still had this concussion issue and when

555
00:23:51,381 --> 00:23:54,020
someone would look at you like right now
you talk,

556
00:23:54,021 --> 00:23:55,280
great,
you look fine.

557
00:23:55,281 --> 00:23:56,630
Doesn't look like there's anything wrong
with you.

558
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,380
People would be like,
oh,

559
00:23:57,381 --> 00:23:58,730
he's fine,
why can't you fight?

560
00:23:58,820 --> 00:23:59,710
But you know what man,
there's,

561
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:04,750
it takes a.
And I'm going to be honest with this 

562
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:05,750
whole recovery period and it takes a lot
out of you.

563
00:24:05,751 --> 00:24:10,751
It takes,
you really have to find something deep 

564
00:24:10,751 --> 00:24:12,020
inside of you.
You have to find that mental strength to

565
00:24:12,021 --> 00:24:13,190
be,
you know what?

566
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:18,490
Because a lot of what people don't 
understand with concussions comes 

567
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:21,191
depression and there's um,
depression is a big side effect of 

568
00:24:21,191 --> 00:24:22,080
depression is a big side effect of 
concussions.

569
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:24,020
So a lot of these guys that you don't 
see it.

570
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:29,290
Yeah,
they just get knocked out and then 

571
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:29,290
they're forgotten about.

572
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:29,290
Those guys go home,
they're depressed.

573
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:31,160
Uh,
their brain chemistry is all mixed up.

574
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:33,230
Their brains not recovering the same 
way.

575
00:24:33,231 --> 00:24:35,270
So it's actually hard.
And these fighters are at home,

576
00:24:35,271 --> 00:24:37,640
probably crying themselves to sleep 
there,

577
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:41,000
have headaches every day,
but they just don't.

578
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:47,110
ThEre's not enough education on what 
these guys are going through and 

579
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,110
suffering with and I know you're really 
big on it,

580
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:50,480
but one of the big things that has 
helped me and we can go,

581
00:24:50,481 --> 00:24:54,560
we can branch off on this is uh,
the use of cbds for brain injuries.

582
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:57,350
That's been incredible for my recovery.
Yes,

583
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:02,360
cbd is non psychoactive compound in 
cannabis and it's a crazy thing that's 

584
00:25:06,081 --> 00:25:11,081
going on here in the states.
I don't know how you guys treated up in 

585
00:25:11,081 --> 00:25:11,600
Canada,
but it's essentially being turned into a

586
00:25:11,601 --> 00:25:14,900
schedule one drug now,
even though it's not psychoactive.

587
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:20,830
Well,
it's 100 percent shenanigans by 

588
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:20,830
pharmaceutical companies.

589
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:23,620
It's 100 percent influenced by these 
people that stand to lose money because 

590
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:26,300
cbd oil helps a lot of people with 
inflammation.

591
00:25:26,301 --> 00:25:31,301
A lot of people with chronic arthritis,
lung cancer as a potential to cure 

592
00:25:31,301 --> 00:25:31,310
cancer.
I don't know.

593
00:25:31,311 --> 00:25:32,720
There's not enough studies,
but hey.

594
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:35,270
Yeah,
it certainly helps treat it.

595
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:39,500
It treats inflammation and inflammation.
Apparently if you talk to doctors,

596
00:25:39,501 --> 00:25:44,501
they'll tell you it's a huge issue and 
one of the biggest issues when it comes 

597
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:47,621
to diseases,
discomfort and things like arthritis 

598
00:25:47,621 --> 00:25:47,621
again,
and headaches,

599
00:25:47,621 --> 00:25:51,970
you know like when you're taking a 
nonsteroidal antiinflammatory for a 

600
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:54,941
headache,
like if you're taking an advil or 

601
00:25:54,941 --> 00:25:56,920
ibuprofen,
what you're taking is something that 

602
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:56,920
reduces inflammation.
I mean that's what it's for.

603
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,690
And cbd oil does the same thing,
but it's natural.

604
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:04,691
It's healthy.
It's not bad for you and it doesn't get 

605
00:26:04,691 --> 00:26:04,691
you high.
It's not like something's gonna fuck you

606
00:26:04,691 --> 00:26:09,011
up at work has been crazy because when I
was going in that dark room there for 

607
00:26:09,011 --> 00:26:10,220
three weeks,
I literally,

608
00:26:10,221 --> 00:26:15,221
doctors were giving me like six to eight
percocets a day and they were giving me 

609
00:26:15,221 --> 00:26:17,330
two muscle relaxants for my back pain.

610
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:19,940
So what was going on with your back?
I don't know,

611
00:26:19,941 --> 00:26:21,380
something with a,
you know,

612
00:26:21,381 --> 00:26:26,381
the nerves from my brain because it must
have damaged some of the inflammation 

613
00:26:26,381 --> 00:26:28,490
and it was causing this back pain and I 
couldn't even get out of bed with.

614
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,130
So they were giving me all of these 
things to cope with it.

615
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:36,370
WhEn and then all of a sudden I got my 
sisters and my family to do some 

616
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:36,370
research.
At that point,

617
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:40,931
man,
I would've taken anything you could've 

618
00:26:40,931 --> 00:26:40,931
given me.
Coke,

619
00:26:40,931 --> 00:26:40,931
heroine,
acid,

620
00:26:40,931 --> 00:26:41,870
you name it.
I would have taken it to recover because

621
00:26:41,871 --> 00:26:43,140
those pills,
they were messing me up.

622
00:26:43,141 --> 00:26:46,350
I was going through like I was living in
a cartoon world in that dark room.

623
00:26:46,351 --> 00:26:51,351
I had no idea what's going on.
I was tripping out and then it got to 

624
00:26:51,351 --> 00:26:51,351
the point where I was like,
listen,

625
00:26:51,351 --> 00:26:51,351
I've been.

626
00:26:51,351 --> 00:26:52,890
I got people to research and they said,
hey,

627
00:26:52,891 --> 00:26:57,891
these cbds help.
My family did all the research and they 

628
00:26:57,891 --> 00:26:58,650
ended up getting me some cbd stuff and 
so how did it for them?

629
00:26:58,651 --> 00:27:00,510
Did you take it?
I got it as a,

630
00:27:00,511 --> 00:27:03,120
as an oil.
So did you just take it on?

631
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:08,121
Drops on your tongue and you put it 
underneath my tongue basically kinda 

632
00:27:08,121 --> 00:27:10,890
thing and I was able to cut out all of 
those percosets and everything just with

633
00:27:11,071 --> 00:27:13,830
cbd oil in how long of a time?
Right away.

634
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,150
Right away.
Right away.

635
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:20,180
I stopped because again,
with those concussions and brain 

636
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:20,180
injuries,
a lot of times you develop insomnia.

637
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,570
So I wasn't sleeping,
I wasn't eating much.

638
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:26,960
What's,
what does cbd and cannabis good for 

639
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,480
munchies,
munchies and sleeping so.

640
00:27:27,481 --> 00:27:29,010
And it was good for my recovery.
So it's,

641
00:27:29,011 --> 00:27:31,080
it,
it helped manage to get off all of those

642
00:27:31,081 --> 00:27:33,060
painkillers and now I'm able to,
you know,

643
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:38,630
be healthy and control my brain 
headaches and stuff without having to 

644
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:38,840
take ibuprofen and advil.

645
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:41,180
Are you still getting headaches?
They come,

646
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:46,390
yeah,
they're still there and we gotta 

647
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:46,530
remember I'm working three full time 
jobs and if you're not,

648
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:48,360
even if you,
you know,

649
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:50,670
your brain is healthy and you're working
three full time jobs,

650
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,710
you're probably going to get a headache 
or to throughout your day,

651
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:55,250
but when you get a headache it's a 
different experience.

652
00:27:55,251 --> 00:27:59,100
It's different because you're also,
you're so aware of where it can go.

653
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,360
Yeah.
Scary.

654
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:03,320
So that's been helping men and I know 
you have,

655
00:28:03,321 --> 00:28:04,800
um,
it's on my list to watch.

656
00:28:04,801 --> 00:28:05,240
But,
uh,

657
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,420
because I was explaining,
I was like,

658
00:28:06,421 --> 00:28:11,421
yo,
you got to tell brogan about your 

659
00:28:11,421 --> 00:28:11,421
experience with cbd and um,
I haven't got to watch it.

660
00:28:11,421 --> 00:28:15,681
I think you wrote it.
It was a 2007 you came up with the 

661
00:28:15,681 --> 00:28:15,681
union.
Yeah.

662
00:28:15,681 --> 00:28:15,681
That was,
um,

663
00:28:15,681 --> 00:28:20,130
that was uh,
a documentary by my buddy adam who had,

664
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:24,210
um,
he lives up in bc and that whole area is

665
00:28:24,211 --> 00:28:29,211
essentially run by the marijuana 
industry even though marijuana is 

666
00:28:29,211 --> 00:28:29,211
illegal.

667
00:28:29,211 --> 00:28:33,800
So they made this documentary explaining
how without marijuana your entire 

668
00:28:34,051 --> 00:28:39,051
economies fucked.
Like it's this underground economy and 

669
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:40,470
they call it the union.
And so it was a really,

670
00:28:40,471 --> 00:28:41,670
really good.
It's on my list.

671
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:43,470
And then he went onto make the culture 
high,

672
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:45,990
which is also an excellent documentary 
that he made after lunch.

673
00:28:45,991 --> 00:28:47,370
I watch both.
Well,

674
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:47,970
it's,
uh,

675
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:48,670
you know,
we,

676
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:53,680
we've been hoodwinked in this country,
unfortunately in all countries now 

677
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:57,231
because of the influence of America.
We've been hoodwinked by the propaganda 

678
00:28:57,231 --> 00:28:58,560
that they came up with in the 19 
thirties,

679
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:01,290
which wasn't even about pharmaceutical 
drugs back then.

680
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:04,350
it was really about the paper industry,
huh?

681
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:07,550
Yeah.
It's William Randolph hearst who was a,

682
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:12,590
a real creepy guy and he was the reason 
why a orson welles made that movie 

683
00:29:12,871 --> 00:29:14,310
citizen kane.
He was the,

684
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:16,970
he was the inspiration for that movie.
Okay.

685
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:17,820
About one guy.

686
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:20,730
I was kind of dominating the world with 
his influence.

687
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:24,030
And William Randolph hearst didn't just 
own newspaper companies.

688
00:29:24,031 --> 00:29:26,640
He also owned paper mills and he owned 
forest,

689
00:29:26,641 --> 00:29:29,520
these enormous forest where they would 
chop down trees to make paper with them.

690
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:33,670
And in the 19 thirties they came out 
with a product called the decorticator.

691
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:38,671
And the decorticator is a machine that 
allowed them to effectively process hemp

692
00:29:38,701 --> 00:29:43,000
fiber very easily because hemp is a very
unusual plant.

693
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,590
And that,
like this table that we have here,

694
00:29:44,591 --> 00:29:47,170
this is oak.
An oak is a very hard wood,

695
00:29:47,171 --> 00:29:49,360
will hemp.
Hemp is as hard as a joke,

696
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:52,450
but it's way lighter.
It's like a freaking alien plant.

697
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:56,350
Like if you pick up a hemp stock,
like this is a decorticator that there,

698
00:29:56,351 --> 00:29:57,250
uh,
this is,

699
00:29:57,251 --> 00:29:57,940
uh,
this is,

700
00:29:57,941 --> 00:30:00,130
uh,
like a modern one I guess.

701
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:04,180
So you throw the hemp fibers in there 
and it grinds them up,

702
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:09,360
which by the way,
hemp is still federally illegal even 

703
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,650
though it's not psychoactive and there's
so much stupidity that's all attached to

704
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:12,780
this.

705
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:18,080
It was just so much.
A tsa has to be under one percent thc or

706
00:30:18,461 --> 00:30:19,550
is that a myth?
It's not.

707
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:23,200
I don't make it legal to sell or 
something along those lines.

708
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:26,590
I don't know.
You can grow it in some states,

709
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:30,370
but the thing is like federally,
federally it's still illegal,

710
00:30:30,371 --> 00:30:33,310
but they're trying to change that.
It's just slow and painful.

711
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:38,640
And again,
it's all the propaganda from the 19 

712
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,761
thirties.
So William Randolph hearst who own 

713
00:30:41,761 --> 00:30:41,860
newspapers,
they came out with this decorticator and

714
00:30:41,861 --> 00:30:44,650
then popular science magazine had this 
cover cv good.

715
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:49,690
And jamie hemp,
the new billion dollar crop because 

716
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:52,770
because of this,
see they used to use hemp way back in 

717
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:55,591
the day,
like the drafts of the declaration of 

718
00:30:55,591 --> 00:30:57,190
independence were written on him.
The sales that they used for,

719
00:30:57,370 --> 00:31:00,490
for boats were all made out of hemp.
All that stuff was out of hemp.

720
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,750
In fact,
canvas,

721
00:31:01,751 --> 00:31:03,850
the word canvas comes from the word 
cannabis,

722
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,000
so the mona lisa was painted on him,
so they came up with that and then when 

723
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,330
eli whitney came up with a cotton gin,
cotton was more effective to use.

724
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,570
Yeah,
so they were going to use it for clothes

725
00:31:15,571 --> 00:31:18,130
and you see it on the cover of popular 
science magazine.

726
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:19,750
It was on the cover though.
Jamie.

727
00:31:19,751 --> 00:31:22,660
See if you isn't popular mechanics,
is that what it is?

728
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,410
Anyway,
so they used to use it for parachutes.

729
00:31:26,411 --> 00:31:28,120
They use it for all these different 
things.

730
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:31,420
But then when eli whitney came up with 
the cotton gin,

731
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:36,540
it was easier for them to make clothes 
out of cotton because hemp requires a 

732
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:39,840
lot to break down the fibers.
Such an abandoned cloth.

733
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:44,870
Yeah,
because it's a crazy plant and it makes 

734
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:47,461
this unbelievable paper,
like hemp paper is so superior to this 

735
00:31:47,461 --> 00:31:47,680
paper that we all use.

736
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,860
Like this paper that we use is shit.
It rips so easy.

737
00:31:50,861 --> 00:31:54,610
Hemp papers really hard to epic.
It weighs the same.

738
00:31:54,611 --> 00:31:56,380
It looks the same.
It feels the same,

739
00:31:56,680 --> 00:32:01,680
but it's just a better fiber.
So instead of William Randolph hearst 

740
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,681
embracing this,
he would have lost millions of dollars 

741
00:32:04,681 --> 00:32:05,470
because he would've had to replant these
forests and tournament at him.

742
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:10,590
He decided to go the other route and 
just start making propaganda against 

743
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:12,460
him.
So he started calling it marijuana.

744
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:15,400
See,
marijuana was never a name for cannabis.

745
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:20,580
Marijuana was a wild mexican tobacco.
They took this name from this wild 

746
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:24,310
mexican tobacco just called it.
They started talking about this new drug

747
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:28,840
that's making white women get raped by 
mexicans and black people.

748
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:31,030
Nice plant wizards,
fIght war time,

749
00:32:31,031 --> 00:32:33,760
drug paralegal that we need hemp.
Lots of it for mortgage.

750
00:32:33,761 --> 00:32:38,761
But hemp means marijuana to content is 
take the drug menace out of this useful 

751
00:32:38,761 --> 00:32:39,280
plant.
Hilarious.

752
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,130
So all this

753
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:45,130
shit came from this one asshole,
one asshole in harry anslinger who was 

754
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,810
the guy in charge of.
Well,

755
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,400
you know,
they originally got a lot of people that

756
00:32:49,401 --> 00:32:53,990
were involved in the alcohol prohibition
and once alcohol prohibition was done,

757
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:55,940
they needed something else to fight.
So they said,

758
00:32:55,941 --> 00:32:57,110
well look,
we've got something right here.

759
00:32:57,111 --> 00:32:59,570
Which call probably does more damage to 
your body then?

760
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:00,470
Oh,
it does.

761
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:02,600
Trust me,
I was drunk as fuck monday night,

762
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:03,590
monday night.
I might've,

763
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:08,890
I might've been blackout drunk.
People tell me for like three days 

764
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:08,890
probably.
Yeah.

765
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:10,940
I feel like shit today a little bit,
but so this,

766
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:13,670
this propaganda,
but they're still fighting this.

767
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,950
They're literally still fighting.
That's kind of like.

768
00:33:15,951 --> 00:33:20,951
It's little different,
but why I'm kickboxing and mmas it was 

769
00:33:20,991 --> 00:33:23,870
so hard to get into ontario stupid,
you know,

770
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:28,040
legislature and stuff from years ago 
that the language ruined.

771
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,400
It just ruins things.
What was the language and it's something

772
00:33:31,401 --> 00:33:34,280
that was something about the belts,
like we can't get kickboxing or,

773
00:33:34,281 --> 00:33:37,460
or more tie in ontario,
Canada because of belt.

774
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:42,700
No,
It's because of some language inside 

775
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,250
like a legal documents and it's all 
within that language.

776
00:33:43,251 --> 00:33:48,050
It says something about you cannot 
perform kicks sir.

777
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:53,470
That's why I like the.
Ufc had so much dIfficult time to get 

778
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:56,801
into toronto,
but it's in there now so it's not yet 

779
00:33:56,801 --> 00:33:58,190
kickboxing.
He's not in toronto.

780
00:33:58,191 --> 00:34:00,080
Above the waist on that.
you can't do local,

781
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:03,910
can't do low kicking fights or 
professional moy.

782
00:34:03,911 --> 00:34:08,510
Tai in ontario is insane.
All old shit from years ago that,

783
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:12,170
you know,
the commissioner was following from long

784
00:34:12,171 --> 00:34:17,171
time ago and even if you ask fighters,
like I had a conversation with matt 

785
00:34:17,171 --> 00:34:18,170
embry who was fighting robin van route 
smiling and we were like,

786
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,990
I don't even know what,
why we don't even know it's Just,

787
00:34:20,991 --> 00:34:25,910
it's been in the legal document the way 
it's written and the terminology screWed

788
00:34:25,911 --> 00:34:26,330
us up.

789
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:31,420
But how is that the case when you can 
still have ufc fights and they're 

790
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:33,911
allowed to low kick and I think it comes
to money probably comes down to money 

791
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:37,220
like everything else that's fucking 
crazy.

792
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:40,760
It's ridiculous.
But You gotta think too off topic,

793
00:34:40,761 --> 00:34:45,761
but look at the canadian kickboxing 
champions that have come out of Canada 

794
00:34:45,761 --> 00:34:46,460
yet.
Simon marcus,

795
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:47,980
You had,
um,

796
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:53,110
which again,
I know one of your favorite fights of 

797
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:53,110
the joe schilling.
Yeah.

798
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:53,110
My god.
What a fight.

799
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:55,230
That was insane.
Yeah.

800
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,320
And then went to the fourth round.
Joe knocked him out.

801
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:00,290
That was crazy.
Crazy fight.

802
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,700
Yeah.
You had gabriel varga.

803
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,770
He had myself now,
matt embry,

804
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:09,610
Robert Thomas from Canada,
and we're producing all of these crazy 

805
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:13,331
athletes and we don't even have a 
professional system and it's crazy 

806
00:35:13,331 --> 00:35:15,200
because there hasn't been one us glory 
champion.

807
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:20,740
Well,
at one point in time before mma or 

808
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:21,710
before the ufC,
he really got a foothold in Brazil.

809
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:27,730
The Canada Market was the biggest market
for mma is outside of the United States.

810
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:29,840
The ones that we had at the roger 
center,

811
00:35:29,841 --> 00:35:31,940
they're 70,000
people.

812
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,790
it was gigantic or 60,000,
whatever the fuck it was.

813
00:35:34,791 --> 00:35:35,960
It was nuts.
It was insane.

814
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,950
Yeah,
and that was a also

815
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:43,010
a lot of it was because of george st 
pierre and george being such a great 

816
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:46,881
representative of Canada,
a great representative of the ufc and a 

817
00:35:46,881 --> 00:35:47,190
great champion like people flock to 
them.

818
00:35:47,191 --> 00:35:52,191
It's one of the things about Canada is 
how loYal canadian citizens are towards 

819
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:54,030
their fighters.
Even if you ask toronto blue jays,

820
00:35:54,031 --> 00:35:55,260
the toronto may police,
man,

821
00:35:55,261 --> 00:35:58,560
We're passionate fans.
That's why kickboxing has to come there.

822
00:35:58,750 --> 00:35:59,760
We're going to build it.
There's.

823
00:35:59,761 --> 00:36:02,160
There's talks about it so it can glory 
make something happen.

824
00:36:02,161 --> 00:36:07,161
Here is talk about the rules here.
The fouls administering a kick to the 

825
00:36:07,161 --> 00:36:08,610
leg,
spinning back fists or illegal,

826
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:11,610
striking the face with any part of the 
arm.

827
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:14,430
Elbows are illegal.
Chopping to the back of the neck.

828
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,180
Oh,
they watched too much.

829
00:36:15,181 --> 00:36:19,170
Flintstones fucking karate chop.
Striking a blow to the groin area.

830
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:21,120
Butting with the head.
What's the top one?

831
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,870
Jamie?
Number one,

832
00:36:21,871 --> 00:36:25,620
striking a blow with an elbow or a knee.
you can't strike a need of the box.

833
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:27,230
They don't get how it works.
Oh,

834
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:32,240
that's hilarious.
But how did the ufc I think is so it's 

835
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:32,640
got to be.
I think you need a big chunk of money to

836
00:36:32,641 --> 00:36:35,400
kind of even get the commissioner to 
look at.

837
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:40,401
You.
Look at this professional boxing where 

838
00:36:40,401 --> 00:36:41,970
blows may be struck with both the fists 
and the feet.

839
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:47,360
That is weird.
So this is the same laws that apply to 

840
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,560
boxing.
They use for kickboxing book.

841
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:53,220
You can only kick with the fee.
Now what if you kick someone with a head

842
00:36:53,221 --> 00:36:55,170
kick and you hit with the shin?
Is it illegal?

843
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,290
They don't even knoW that you shouldn't 
take.

844
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,910
No one thinks you're kicking with feet.
That's hilarious.

845
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,930
Sweeping above the ankle.
She can't even have a fucking.

846
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,650
You can't even sweep someone.
It's,

847
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:06,900
it's,
it's ridiculous.

848
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:09,780
Above the ankle so you can't sweep 
right?

849
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:14,310
You just sweep shitty,
shitty.

850
00:37:14,311 --> 00:37:15,840
But it's okay.
Yeah,

851
00:37:15,841 --> 00:37:19,320
it's crazy.
Intentionally using block.

852
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:22,740
You can't block within the chat below 
the waist,

853
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:27,741
so I guess there's no need.
The block a body kick you block with a 

854
00:37:28,201 --> 00:37:30,270
body kick.
Oh my god.

855
00:37:30,271 --> 00:37:35,271
Intentionally evading contact or they 
got a lot of fucking wacky rules.

856
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:40,670
Striking a blow with an open glove.
They changed the commissioner who was 

857
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:41,400
kind of really strict too.
This is now out.

858
00:37:41,401 --> 00:37:43,860
So this one would changes using abusive 
language?

859
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:45,300
No,
nick diaz fights in Canada.

860
00:37:45,301 --> 00:37:48,930
Folks disobeying the referee going down 
intentionally.

861
00:37:48,931 --> 00:37:51,660
Intentionally using the nea as a block.
Wow.

862
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:55,680
Extending the legs for the purpose of 
preventing an opponent from kicking.

863
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,170
what?
Yeah.

864
00:37:57,390 --> 00:38:01,620
What the fuck is that?
It's messed up.

865
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,070
How weird is that?
Extending the leg for the pope?

866
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,800
Purpose of preventing an opponent from 
kicking.

867
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:11,760
I'm guessing this was written in 1990,
but that doesn't even make any sense.

868
00:38:11,761 --> 00:38:13,350
Like,
you can't even use it team then,

869
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:17,540
like if you wanted to extend your leg 
like a tape is to extend the leg,

870
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:20,160
mean your front kicking a guy,
you're pushing them off.

871
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:22,170
You could say that.
That would like,

872
00:38:22,171 --> 00:38:23,910
I've been to one of my,
um,

873
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:26,200
one of the guys I train is troy 
sheridan.

874
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,950
He fought in above the weight,
kickboxing fight professionally.

875
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,550
He actually fought,
uM,

876
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,580
another old ufc fighter.
Jesse ronson,

877
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:36,070
he think he's fought twice on the ufc 
and

878
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:40,450
before he got released,
jesse ronson who was.

879
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:42,350
Oh,
johnny johnny's terrio.

880
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:47,620
Yeah.
He was just one of the best known 

881
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:47,620
canadian kickbox.
He was a bad Motherfucker.

882
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:50,110
My Above the waist of the waist.
Kickboxer he was the,

883
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:55,260
he was the man,
but that day and he was one of the few 

884
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:59,530
guys that was like really exciting.
It would knock guys dead.

885
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:01,340
I didn't get to watch a lot of it,
but I've,

886
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:05,950
I've done my research and watched a few 
of his fights after and that's crazy for

887
00:39:05,951 --> 00:39:09,040
god about him for a long time until 
justice conversation.

888
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:11,050
Well,
you goTta think a rufus,

889
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:13,000
rufus as brother.
Sure.

890
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,220
Rick rufus.
Yeah.

891
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:18,580
Rick rufus was one of the most popular I
would say.

892
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:19,300
Oh,
for sure.

893
00:39:19,301 --> 00:39:20,830
Well,
he was so flashy too.

894
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:23,800
He could do so many wild techniques 
inside the octagon.

895
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:25,870
Did you ever see the fight where he 
fought a tie fighter?

896
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:26,500
Yes,
I did.

897
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:27,910
Yeah,
those low kicks,

898
00:39:27,911 --> 00:39:28,780
man.
I wasn't exciting.

899
00:39:28,781 --> 00:39:31,870
Fight to down to that and his stuff's 
good.

900
00:39:31,871 --> 00:39:35,410
He posted one with the mine and mark to 
bond and he put a nice little.

901
00:39:35,411 --> 00:39:37,120
The way I set up that high kick.
He's good.

902
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,140
Yeah,
he's very good.

903
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:43,380
And it's interesting because the way 
that fight essentially changed a lot of 

904
00:39:43,871 --> 00:39:48,871
people's ideas about low kicks because 
even duke roufus like they interviewed 

905
00:39:48,871 --> 00:39:50,530
roof is after the funny thing.
It was like 19 and he's like,

906
00:39:50,531 --> 00:39:55,531
well,
it doesn't take any talent to just kick 

907
00:39:55,531 --> 00:39:55,531
the legs.
Yeah,

908
00:39:55,531 --> 00:39:55,531
yeah,
yeah.

909
00:39:55,531 --> 00:39:56,920
I rememBer.
That was crazy weird idea.

910
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:59,590
You gotta ask him about that.
We talked to him about it.

911
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:04,420
He's a huge proponent.
He became a world champion,

912
00:40:04,421 --> 00:40:05,770
you know,
loves his low kicks.

913
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,620
He was seeing his brother at such a 
young age,

914
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:11,560
but that opened up everyone's eyes to 
low kick.

915
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:14,230
Oh yeah man,
but the low kicks he people think like,

916
00:40:14,231 --> 00:40:18,070
my style of the low kicks style is like,
there's a new thing is actually a really

917
00:40:18,071 --> 00:40:21,640
old concept that was kind of forgotten 
about.

918
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:26,940
And then there's only a few people that 
came in and stuck true to that low kick 

919
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:27,940
style.
I think it's underrated,

920
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:33,150
especially in mma.
And I think I'm going to bring it up 

921
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:33,150
about mma.
Everyone was like,

922
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:36,751
yeah,
but the takedowns of good low kick is 

923
00:40:36,751 --> 00:40:36,751
based off timing.
Um,

924
00:40:36,751 --> 00:40:41,170
if I'm going to sit there and get a lead
with a low kick against the rest of 

925
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:41,170
their.
Absolutely.

926
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:44,880
He's going to take me down every time.
But I think it's the timing of the low 

927
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,090
kick that people need to understand.
If someone's exiting backwards,

928
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:48,400
that's your time for the low kicks.
So if you put,

929
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:51,970
especially in mma where people can't 
really stand in the pocket,

930
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:55,810
they move and they exit as soon as they 
get outside of punch range,

931
00:40:55,811 --> 00:40:56,530
that's perfect.

932
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:59,500
Low kick time and you'll get so many 
free low kicks on mma.

933
00:40:59,501 --> 00:41:03,970
Guys and Their legs aren't strong.
Mma guys aren't used to that.

934
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:06,790
Um,
body damage that kickboxers are,

935
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:07,890
and I remember,
um,

936
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:10,600
my coach coach gary goodridge,
um,

937
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,480
and gary once told me,
he's like,

938
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:16,150
when he got fought both kickboxing and 
mma,

939
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:17,650
he came back and said,
he's like,

940
00:41:17,651 --> 00:41:20,440
I knew I could go to the after party 
when I fought mma,

941
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:22,690
but he goes in after a kickboxing fight.
He's lIke,

942
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:27,960
I'm not getting out of my bed.
You got to think how much shinta shin 

943
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,950
kickboxers go through compared to an mma
fight.

944
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:34,230
How often do you see a late kick checked
in the or there?

945
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:36,140
It's getting better.
It's getting better,

946
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:37,230
getting better.
But I,

947
00:41:37,231 --> 00:41:42,231
I agree with you and that's another 
thing that people always complain about 

948
00:41:42,231 --> 00:41:42,231
me,
but I'm always calling for low kicks and

949
00:41:42,231 --> 00:41:44,480
saying I'd like to see more low kick.
So I like to see him kick his legs more.

950
00:41:44,481 --> 00:41:49,481
But I think you're right too,
that it takes someone who understands 

951
00:41:49,481 --> 00:41:53,051
moitai at a very high level to be able 
to pull that off and do it in 

952
00:41:53,051 --> 00:41:55,991
combination.
When you're seeing sometimes in mma is 

953
00:41:55,991 --> 00:41:59,020
you would see a lot during the george st
pierre era where guys were afraid to 

954
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:01,100
kick because george was so good at 
timing explosive,

955
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:03,440
but again,
who was he fighting against?

956
00:42:03,441 --> 00:42:06,920
He wasn't fighting against a guy who 
actually knew how to use the proper.

957
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:07,880
Yeah.
Yeah,

958
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:10,700
and we don't really see that many people
lIke,

959
00:42:10,701 --> 00:42:12,620
I mean you have a few in the sales 
division.

960
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:16,100
Would you say jose though?
Joseph has spectacular leg kicks,

961
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:17,840
no doubt about it.
And he was killing guys.

962
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:18,980
Oh yeah.
I mean,

963
00:42:18,981 --> 00:42:20,380
you look at the notoriety,
right?

964
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:23,270
Favorite fight was horrendous.
I called that fight and afterwards,

965
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:28,590
you know,
uriah posted all these instagram 

966
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:30,881
pictures and social horrible leg,
swollen leg twice the size and yeah,

967
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:33,950
got it.
There was a meme on my phone.

968
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:38,951
I keep sending because a lot of times 
inspiring and some will smash my guy's 

969
00:42:38,951 --> 00:42:39,470
legs and then I'll send them the picture
and being like,

970
00:42:39,471 --> 00:42:42,680
tag someone who doesn't know how to 
block a low kick and I just keep sending

971
00:42:42,681 --> 00:42:44,750
that picture out of mess around with 
everyone.

972
00:42:44,751 --> 00:42:45,710
But yeah,
it was brutal.

973
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,740
Brutal.
Now what happens to your ears?

974
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,710
Your eyes leg?
Oh yeah,

975
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:56,140
yeah.
He had to go in a hyperbaric chamber to 

976
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:56,140
try to lessen the,
uh,

977
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:56,840
the injury.

978
00:42:57,010 --> 00:43:02,010
Try to heal the injury quicker,
but people don't understand the damage 

979
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:02,010
they do.
It's like,

980
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:03,560
hey,
if every time you punch,

981
00:43:03,561 --> 00:43:06,290
I smash your leg,
you're not going to want to punch me.

982
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,410
And that's the timing I use.
So as soon as someone jabs,

983
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,600
you take the leg because when someone 
punches,

984
00:43:11,601 --> 00:43:16,601
they have to put their weight on their 
front leg and once you put your weight 

985
00:43:16,601 --> 00:43:19,990
on the front,
like you can no longer block at that 

986
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:22,031
point.
So if you watch any of my fights are 

987
00:43:22,031 --> 00:43:24,131
guys with good low kicks,
they usually timed the low kick off the 

988
00:43:24,131 --> 00:43:26,441
hands because,
or the step because every time you step 

989
00:43:26,441 --> 00:43:26,690
you got to be heavy on your,
on your front foot.

990
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,940
And that's the opportunity to hit that 
low kick.

991
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:32,660
So you want to look for what I call free
low kicks ones where they can't block.

992
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:37,900
So as they're exiting up or as they step
in or you've tried to find those free 

993
00:43:38,031 --> 00:43:43,031
ones when they're planted on their legs 
and they can't lift up there like the 

994
00:43:43,031 --> 00:43:46,101
black jamie put up,
see If you can find joe's fight with 

995
00:43:46,101 --> 00:43:48,740
Raymond Daniels because like I said 
before,

996
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:51,140
this was one of my.
And I'm a big Raymond Daniels fan by the

997
00:43:51,141 --> 00:43:52,820
way.
It's not a knock on him at all.

998
00:43:52,821 --> 00:43:57,821
I think he's awesome and I think his 
style is very important because it's 

999
00:43:57,821 --> 00:44:01,541
very,
it's very important to know that there 

1000
00:44:01,541 --> 00:44:01,541
is a guy who can do the kind of stuff 
that he can do.

1001
00:44:01,541 --> 00:44:03,350
It's incredible.
He does that jump side kick,

1002
00:44:03,351 --> 00:44:08,351
spinning back kick.
I mean he does a lot of wild shit inside

1003
00:44:09,951 --> 00:44:14,951
the octagon and so this fight to me was 
a really important fight for just 

1004
00:44:15,501 --> 00:44:20,501
martial arts strategy and technique to 
see how a guy like you,

1005
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:26,080
who's super high level guy deals with a 
guy who's completely unorthodox in terms

1006
00:44:26,421 --> 00:44:29,690
of traditional kickboxing techniques,
you know,

1007
00:44:29,691 --> 00:44:32,640
he's got a style that is impossible

1008
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,480
to emulate inside inside the.
Again,

1009
00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:37,050
I fought kareem gaji over a hundred 
fights.

1010
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:42,080
nikki hold skin over 100 fights.
I've fought guys mark to bond over 100 

1011
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:47,001
fights.
He was probably the fighter I was most 

1012
00:44:47,001 --> 00:44:47,001
scared to fight because all this wild 
shit.

1013
00:44:47,001 --> 00:44:47,001
I'm like,
man,

1014
00:44:47,001 --> 00:44:51,651
do I.
The last thing I want to be as part of 

1015
00:44:51,651 --> 00:44:53,871
a,
a knockout real of Raymond Daniels 

1016
00:44:53,871 --> 00:44:53,871
spinning hook,
kick knocking me the frig out.

1017
00:44:53,871 --> 00:44:56,730
So I mean I was scared then.
So at this point,

1018
00:44:56,731 --> 00:44:58,320
like even in round one,
it was just like,

1019
00:44:58,321 --> 00:45:02,070
what the heck is this guy going to do?
I had no idea what the heck this guy was

1020
00:45:02,071 --> 00:45:07,071
going to do.
One of the things I really love about 

1021
00:45:07,071 --> 00:45:07,071
watching fight too is always a very high
guard,

1022
00:45:07,071 --> 00:45:08,640
very high guard,
very good fundamentals.

1023
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:13,760
And even when you're doing those 
training sequences that you put on 

1024
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:14,520
instagram,
everything you do,

1025
00:45:14,521 --> 00:45:16,020
you're,
your guard is high.

1026
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:19,170
You're doing everything by the book.
Solid basics.

1027
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:20,820
The key.
Who is your original?

1028
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:26,240
MY original trainers palmen has and that
was the one who trained gary goodridge 

1029
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,170
through k one and pride.
But yeaH,

1030
00:45:28,171 --> 00:45:30,330
paul men has.
He's the one who really developed my low

1031
00:45:30,331 --> 00:45:35,331
kick style and I just was able to really
put it together and showcase his 

1032
00:45:36,571 --> 00:45:41,571
strategy of low kicks.
The way he used to explain it is that 

1033
00:45:41,571 --> 00:45:42,160
people think a low kick is a low kick,
but it's,

1034
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:45,870
it's not you gotta think we're on the 
shin.

1035
00:45:45,930 --> 00:45:47,580
Are you landing the cake?
Right?

1036
00:45:47,730 --> 00:45:50,100
If you land more of the lower part of 
your shin,

1037
00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:55,130
that's more of a setup.
You might want to use your low kick to 

1038
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:57,321
set up your hands.
You might want to have it as a feeler 

1039
00:45:57,321 --> 00:45:57,560
just as a distraction.
Um,

1040
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:59,840
if you start landing higher up on the 
shin,

1041
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:01,470
those are more finished low kicks.

1042
00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:04,650
the angle you throw it at the timing you
throw it at.

1043
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,320
So when we were,
when paul was training me,

1044
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:12,500
he would kind of classify like nine 
different locations based on where on 

1045
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,190
the leg gets hitting and where on your 
shin your landing.

1046
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:16,200
So there's so much more.
It's like a jab.

1047
00:46:16,201 --> 00:46:18,480
There's not just theirs up jabs,
there's,

1048
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:21,360
you know,
jab with your head off to off on angles.

1049
00:46:21,361 --> 00:46:23,280
There's low jabs,
hijabs.

1050
00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:28,610
Each job has a different purpose in same
thing with the low kick or you just lit 

1051
00:46:28,610 --> 00:46:31,530
him up with that low kick and you saw 
that little limp that guys start doing.

1052
00:46:31,531 --> 00:46:36,531
When you see right there,
like once you start landing these big 

1053
00:46:36,531 --> 00:46:38,340
shots to the legs,
you slow them down considerably.

1054
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:43,020
Now what did you do to prepare for his 
movement and this front leg style?

1055
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:45,810
Because he was throwiNg a lot of front 
like psychics to your front leg.

1056
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:51,050
It was just this fight.
What lot of people don't see when you 

1057
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:52,170
fight,
it's a lot of it is risk control.

1058
00:46:52,950 --> 00:46:57,090
You can't just chase raymond as you have
to get him against the ropes.

1059
00:46:57,810 --> 00:47:00,690
You got a corner room and if you see 
when he blitzes,

1060
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:04,140
I don't move back.
If you move back,

1061
00:47:04,141 --> 00:47:07,870
you give him an exit and an opportunity 
to escape where if you stay.

1062
00:47:07,871 --> 00:47:12,871
See when he blitzes,
I stay right in his pocket and it opens 

1063
00:47:12,871 --> 00:47:13,870
up the low kick and you're forcing them 
to move backwards as well,

1064
00:47:13,871 --> 00:47:15,540
which it's very tiring.
Yeah.

1065
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:16,140
Yeah.
It's.

1066
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:19,110
Most people get way more tired moving 
back.

1067
00:47:19,111 --> 00:47:20,280
Then they do.
Moving forward.

1068
00:47:20,310 --> 00:47:22,440
it seems like you're both fighting at 
the same pace,

1069
00:47:22,441 --> 00:47:23,670
but who's doing more work?
Well,

1070
00:47:23,671 --> 00:47:28,671
this round was more of a feel around and
you've got to remember after this fight 

1071
00:47:28,671 --> 00:47:30,010
I fought nikki holtz a,
so it's

1072
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:31,780
20 minutes later.
Fucking crazy.

1073
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:33,880
Twenty minutes later.
So a fan of that.

1074
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:35,140
I really admire that.
I.

1075
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:40,380
I personally don't.
You got to think your brain is still 

1076
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:40,720
shook up from that first fight if not 
fully recovered.

1077
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:46,020
and in my opinion,
the best fighter doesn't necessarily 

1078
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:46,840
come out on top and internal too many 
variables.

1079
00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:48,730
Yeah.
Well it's crazy.

1080
00:47:48,731 --> 00:47:49,820
It's fun to watch.
It's,

1081
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:54,930
it's exciting when you're watching it 
because it builds up to one eventual 

1082
00:47:54,930 --> 00:47:56,260
champion and you get to watch all these 
fights take place during the night,

1083
00:47:56,261 --> 00:48:01,261
but I think especially you're getting 
hurt and then you recovering a little 

1084
00:48:01,261 --> 00:48:05,401
bit and then going back in again.
You're still busted up from the first 

1085
00:48:05,401 --> 00:48:08,401
fight.
I probably lost a good 10 years of my 

1086
00:48:08,401 --> 00:48:08,401
life after that night,
but what are you going to do?

1087
00:48:08,401 --> 00:48:13,050
Yeah,
but there used to be eight minute 

1088
00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:13,050
tournaments.
Yeah.

1089
00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:13,050
Aight man tournament.

1090
00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:15,010
So that's three fights in one night.
Do you just want nikki holds can twice a

1091
00:48:15,011 --> 00:48:16,030
just once,
just once,

1092
00:48:16,031 --> 00:48:18,220
just once.
And in one night you got to think.

1093
00:48:18,221 --> 00:48:21,850
I got one of the knockouts of the year 
in this fight and I got the fight of the

1094
00:48:21,851 --> 00:48:26,851
year.
Nikki and I one fight of the year that 

1095
00:48:26,851 --> 00:48:27,100
year where we jUst sat and exchange 
combinations for three rounds.

1096
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:29,080
No,
it was an awesome fight.

1097
00:48:29,290 --> 00:48:31,210
Now they are.
You see like he started to limp.

1098
00:48:31,270 --> 00:48:33,310
No.
Did you bring anybody in that,

1099
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:38,340
that,
that kicks like this that throws those 

1100
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:38,340
front leg side sidekicks and the hopping
kicks.

1101
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:39,460
You know what?
It was very tough.

1102
00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:44,490
I experimenTed with a,
a taekwondo guy and it just wasn't the 

1103
00:48:44,490 --> 00:48:46,300
same.
And the problem is a lot of these karate

1104
00:48:46,301 --> 00:48:51,301
guys,
they can't handle that constant 

1105
00:48:51,301 --> 00:48:51,301
pressure.
There used to guys standing,

1106
00:48:51,301 --> 00:48:52,930
keeping distance with them,
letting them kick.

1107
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:56,680
But I was too much of a bully for those 
guys.

1108
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,770
I was able to just stay in the pocket.
They try to throw spinning kicks.

1109
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:04,780
I would just push them on the ground.
It was like they couldn't handle like 

1110
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:05,660
the constant strong pressure style.
It's,

1111
00:49:05,670 --> 00:49:08,890
it's,
it's definitely interesting to watch how

1112
00:49:08,891 --> 00:49:10,630
far,
how it's so much more.

1113
00:49:10,631 --> 00:49:15,631
Yeah,
there it is over and over again and 

1114
00:49:15,631 --> 00:49:15,631
you're seeing them limping now and 
you're noticing them as you're fighting,

1115
00:49:15,631 --> 00:49:19,591
you're noticing that and you keep 
hitting that same spot and now he's 

1116
00:49:19,591 --> 00:49:19,591
moving and he's standing.
Soundcloud,

1117
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:22,840
you can tell he's done.
He mixes it up a little bit.

1118
00:49:22,841 --> 00:49:24,640
I mean,
he does switch the stances,

1119
00:49:24,641 --> 00:49:29,641
but you could see he's really trying to 
protect that left leg now he's keeping 

1120
00:49:29,641 --> 00:49:29,950
it back.
Now.

1121
00:49:29,951 --> 00:49:34,951
When you did bringing those guys,
was there anything that they could show 

1122
00:49:34,951 --> 00:49:39,280
you about how to avoid those kicks are 
more just kinda like,

1123
00:49:39,281 --> 00:49:44,281
hey,
this is kind of the distance and the 

1124
00:49:44,281 --> 00:49:44,281
setup.

1125
00:49:44,281 --> 00:49:44,281
These are the kind of few things you 
need to look at.

1126
00:49:44,281 --> 00:49:45,420
But I was really,
uh,

1127
00:49:45,990 --> 00:49:47,140
uh,
in my fiker,

1128
00:49:47,141 --> 00:49:49,240
which I kind of have a different 
philosophy now.

1129
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:54,510
Now that I'm a coach a lot more and I'm 
looking at fighting a little bit 

1130
00:49:54,510 --> 00:49:54,510
differently.
Um,

1131
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:57,640
but here I knew I was going to fight my 
fight.

1132
00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:00,200
He had to fight my way,
um,

1133
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:02,020
if not,
he was going to be in trouble.

1134
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:03,580
It was three in a row.
Boom,

1135
00:50:03,610 --> 00:50:04,360
boom,
boom.

1136
00:50:04,361 --> 00:50:06,940
You just chop and chop and at that leg,
to me,

1137
00:50:06,941 --> 00:50:10,750
this is like the fight that I show 
people when I show people the difference

1138
00:50:10,751 --> 00:50:15,751
between a really good thai fighter who 
is fighting a guy who throws a lot of 

1139
00:50:16,001 --> 00:50:19,630
flashy stuff but doesn't really know the
low kick game.

1140
00:50:20,110 --> 00:50:25,110
And he throws those things,
but there's not a lot of threat outside 

1141
00:50:25,110 --> 00:50:26,200
those spinning attacks.
He does have that explosive lefthand but

1142
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:28,160
good.
You can shut that

1143
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:29,270
down really good.
Well,

1144
00:50:29,271 --> 00:50:31,670
he's,
he was a great karate point fighter,

1145
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:32,600
but his,
not.

1146
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:35,390
His boxing has come along way since this
fight.

1147
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:38,030
I think he learned a lot about a lot of 
things in this fight,

1148
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,350
but his,
um,

1149
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:42,080
his hands weren't the big threat,
you know,

1150
00:50:42,110 --> 00:50:45,020
that's one of the things that 
differentiates him from wonderboy.

1151
00:50:45,110 --> 00:50:47,510
Also wonder boys obviously fighting with
smaller gloves,

1152
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:52,810
but wonderboy has nasty hands.
So if wonderboy in raymond dan is where 

1153
00:50:52,810 --> 00:50:54,140
to fight and kick boxing,
who went?

1154
00:50:54,230 --> 00:50:57,170
That's an interesting question.
I wonder boys,

1155
00:50:57,171 --> 00:51:00,670
undefeated kickboxing,
but he hasn't checked box things.

1156
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:02,300
I don't know.
I'm like,

1157
00:51:02,301 --> 00:51:03,950
you hear about this guy's like,
oh yeah,

1158
00:51:03,951 --> 00:51:04,580
he's,
you know,

1159
00:51:04,581 --> 00:51:06,830
he's undefeated as a kick boxer.
I was like,

1160
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:11,980
hey,
we're the same weight if you're 

1161
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:13,931
undefeated in years,
so how can we never heard of each other 

1162
00:51:13,931 --> 00:51:13,931
or saw each other?

1163
00:51:13,931 --> 00:51:15,010
Like what happens with a lot of these 
guys and,

1164
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:16,670
and,
and with kickboxing,

1165
00:51:16,671 --> 00:51:21,671
there's so many different organizations.
So you'll see guys that'll come around 

1166
00:51:21,671 --> 00:51:21,671
and say like,
I'm a,

1167
00:51:21,671 --> 00:51:22,760
I'm a 10 time world champion.
Are they okay.

1168
00:51:22,761 --> 00:51:25,130
Like where there's,
I think there should be,

1169
00:51:25,131 --> 00:51:28,220
like there's one world champion that 
matters right now and its glory.

1170
00:51:28,310 --> 00:51:30,350
Right?
So any other belt than that?

1171
00:51:30,351 --> 00:51:31,850
To me,
I don't think you're a world champion.

1172
00:51:31,870 --> 00:51:32,900
Well,
what about lion fight?

1173
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,090
What about more time?
I mean,

1174
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:36,200
obviously it's a little bit different.
A different class.

1175
00:51:36,201 --> 00:51:38,480
I would say more thai and kickboxing are
very different.

1176
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:41,840
What do you like better?
I'm a straight kickbox.

1177
00:51:41,870 --> 00:51:43,720
And why do you like kickboxing better 
than more time?

1178
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:47,290
Because I like to rely on pace,
uh,

1179
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:49,450
more aggression and more,
uh,

1180
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:51,590
I'm a combination style fighter,
so I liked him,

1181
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:53,000
always mix up,
kicks and punches,

1182
00:51:53,001 --> 00:51:53,870
punches and kicks.

1183
00:51:54,130 --> 00:51:55,520
Um,
I fought to full rules,

1184
00:51:55,540 --> 00:52:00,110
more time fights.
One of them was I'm a french fighter who

1185
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:03,070
was again sick.
My sixth professional fight.

1186
00:52:03,071 --> 00:52:06,440
It was his 70th and he came in.
He was just,

1187
00:52:06,441 --> 00:52:09,380
I beat them up on the outside,
but as soon as he came close,

1188
00:52:09,381 --> 00:52:11,240
he clinched up with my elbows,
elbows,

1189
00:52:11,241 --> 00:52:12,770
elbows,
and he split my head open.

1190
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:15,440
Six weeks later I fought that and it's 
actually,

1191
00:52:15,441 --> 00:52:18,230
I'm on youtube.
I fought a medi baghdad.

1192
00:52:18,390 --> 00:52:20,300
That would be a cool one for you to 
watch.

1193
00:52:20,550 --> 00:52:23,630
'em and I put a little clip on if we 
want to find it after this one,

1194
00:52:23,631 --> 00:52:28,631
it's literally like I've made it into 
like a two minute clip and it's just 

1195
00:52:28,790 --> 00:52:33,790
beating the crap out of him.
And he landed two elbows and I got like 

1196
00:52:33,790 --> 00:52:35,000
30 stitches at the end of that fight.
Covered In blood.

1197
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:37,970
I got like a three inch gash in my head.

1198
00:52:37,970 --> 00:52:40,880
I had five stitches off my eyes.
He landed two elbows,

1199
00:52:40,881 --> 00:52:42,470
two strikes,
basically the whole flight.

1200
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:45,320
And those two strikes were the damaging 
ones.

1201
00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:46,670
Wow.
Which I mean,

1202
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:47,690
okay.
It's cool.

1203
00:52:47,691 --> 00:52:50,810
I knew I wanted to be a kickboxer,
so I never focused on my elbows.

1204
00:52:50,811 --> 00:52:52,940
Could I be a more thai champion?
Absolutely.

1205
00:52:53,210 --> 00:52:57,340
But my focus was on kickboxing and at 
that point to get into the k,

1206
00:52:57,341 --> 00:52:58,700
one max.
Right,

1207
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:00,680
right.
I want it to fight this mbds.

1208
00:53:00,681 --> 00:53:02,840
I want it to fight aLl of the,
you know,

1209
00:53:02,841 --> 00:53:05,420
the book cows.
I wanted to fight those guys.

1210
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:10,160
So my focus was always on kIckboxing 
from the day I started.

1211
00:53:10,450 --> 00:53:11,510
You will.
That was,

1212
00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:15,730
that was the big organization.
K one was the big organization that kind

1213
00:53:15,731 --> 00:53:17,880
of opened Up kickboxing to the world,
you know,

1214
00:53:18,010 --> 00:53:19,730
in Japan,
did an amazing job oF that.

1215
00:53:19,910 --> 00:53:21,020
And then they had,
of Course,

1216
00:53:21,021 --> 00:53:25,010
it's showtime and it's show time ran for
awhile and that they became glory,

1217
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:25,230
right?

1218
00:53:25,290 --> 00:53:26,280
Yeah.
There's part of it.

1219
00:53:26,281 --> 00:53:31,281
And they shut down because there was.
The problem is there was a lot of 

1220
00:53:31,281 --> 00:53:31,281
problems happening in holland.
Uh,

1221
00:53:31,281 --> 00:53:32,480
there was a lot of like,
um,

1222
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:35,970
illegal stuff happening.
It's illegal to finish right here.

1223
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:39,840
This is your Battery.
I'm now just the amount of shots.

1224
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:44,880
That's it.
Had care console over the amount of 

1225
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,421
shots that he took to the legs.
Now when you were saying that mma 

1226
00:53:47,421 --> 00:53:50,811
fighters,
they don't have the toughness of the 

1227
00:53:50,811 --> 00:53:53,961
legs,
they're not used to taking the 

1228
00:53:53,961 --> 00:53:53,961
punishment and the legs.
What is the difference?

1229
00:53:53,961 --> 00:53:57,201
Like hOw does,
how does your legs get tougher from 

1230
00:53:57,201 --> 00:53:57,201
getting kicked?
Well,

1231
00:53:57,201 --> 00:53:57,201
it's like,
um,

1232
00:53:57,201 --> 00:53:58,170
if you look at martial arts in your 
body,

1233
00:53:58,171 --> 00:54:00,060
your body has,
it's your armor.

1234
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:03,630
So you gotta look at your body as armor.
If you don't strengthen that armor,

1235
00:54:03,631 --> 00:54:05,580
you're only as strong as your armor can 
hold,

1236
00:54:05,581 --> 00:54:05,880
right?

1237
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:08,700
So if you're not training your Body to 
get hit,

1238
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:09,910
um,
it's,

1239
00:54:09,950 --> 00:54:12,090
it's,
you can't really take as much damage.

1240
00:54:12,390 --> 00:54:16,050
So if you're constantly taking low kicks
every day in training,

1241
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:21,140
you build up that endurance and that 
tolerance and that strength to be able 

1242
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:21,140
to take hard,
low kicks.

1243
00:54:21,270 --> 00:54:26,270
But a lot of guys,
if you're not used to that taking heart 

1244
00:54:26,270 --> 00:54:26,270
arm kicks.
When I my first professionaL fight,

1245
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:30,270
I left with like welts on my forearm.
My knees would be swollen,

1246
00:54:30,271 --> 00:54:35,271
I couldn't even get my shoe on after the
fight because everything was just so 

1247
00:54:35,271 --> 00:54:38,331
swollen and you just take so much damage
on the body that eventually it hardens 

1248
00:54:38,331 --> 00:54:43,011
and gets stronger and like,
I mean you got to look at our shins or 

1249
00:54:43,011 --> 00:54:44,730
kickboxing and muay thai.
Shins were going through bats,

1250
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:49,740
whatever you want.
We're just constantly kicking things 

1251
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:51,981
where an mma,
there's not as much focus on 

1252
00:54:51,981 --> 00:54:53,430
condItioning and hardening the body 
because you don't need it as much,

1253
00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:58,730
but what does condition the legs take 
that kind of punishment and constant 

1254
00:54:58,730 --> 00:55:02,661
hitting loosen years of training or 
getting someone to constantly lightly 

1255
00:55:02,661 --> 00:55:04,410
touch your legs,
build up the tolerance.

1256
00:55:04,410 --> 00:55:08,970
You got to build a strong armor to be 
able to withstand whatever damage.

1257
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:14,000
What I'm confused about those,
like what is the physical response that 

1258
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,390
your body has to getting physiologic 
clots?

1259
00:55:15,450 --> 00:55:17,310
Well,
I know the shin for example,

1260
00:55:17,550 --> 00:55:21,000
every time you spend there's like those 
microfractures that then calcify,

1261
00:55:21,001 --> 00:55:24,000
which then caused the shin to harden.
And again,

1262
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:26,360
even if the difference between my right 
and left shin,

1263
00:55:26,370 --> 00:55:31,370
my right shin is probably double the 
size of my left one because I'm used my 

1264
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:35,091
right shin a lot more really.
So I mean it's just constant years of 

1265
00:55:35,091 --> 00:55:37,350
training your body to do it.
And what about this,

1266
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:39,760
what about your quads?
And although the lake,

1267
00:55:40,050 --> 00:55:42,480
I wonder what it is,
is it nerves?

1268
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:47,340
Your nerves are able to withstand the 
pain or is the big difference?

1269
00:55:47,341 --> 00:55:52,341
And it's weird because I've been doing 
it so long where I can usually stand in 

1270
00:55:52,341 --> 00:55:56,211
front of you,
give you like little lake tapps and I 

1271
00:55:56,211 --> 00:55:58,401
can kind of see how hard your body is.
If you can withstand a low kick or now 

1272
00:55:58,401 --> 00:56:00,120
you just.
It's a feeling mechanism so you feel how

1273
00:56:00,121 --> 00:56:03,840
they're responding to it is how they put
their weight,

1274
00:56:03,841 --> 00:56:05,490
their pressure on it.
You can tell.

1275
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:09,420
You can really tell and when you fight 
someone and that's where those guys that

1276
00:56:09,421 --> 00:56:12,030
have a 100 professional fights have 
that.

1277
00:56:12,270 --> 00:56:17,270
There's a lot of wear and tear,
but those guys have a body armor that 

1278
00:56:17,270 --> 00:56:21,590
really takes a lot to try to damage an 
older those forearms or those lake cakes

1279
00:56:21,871 --> 00:56:24,460
or it was just years of accumulated

1280
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:29,460
damage in the body.
Heart ends up is weird because like you 

1281
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:32,611
see some of the ties that just blast 
each other and you'll watch them low 

1282
00:56:32,611 --> 00:56:33,430
kick each other and you never see him 
limping.

1283
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:34,600
No.
You know what I mean?

1284
00:56:34,601 --> 00:56:39,601
And you see this fight that you had with
raymond and you see like after you know 

1285
00:56:39,601 --> 00:56:41,350
a minute or in the fight when you kept 
chopping,

1286
00:56:41,351 --> 00:56:42,970
there was one moment in the fight in the
first round.

1287
00:56:42,971 --> 00:56:47,971
I remember watching it live and you 
caught them with one low kick in the 

1288
00:56:47,971 --> 00:56:47,971
first round.
I went,

1289
00:56:47,971 --> 00:56:47,971
oh,
there it goes.

1290
00:56:48,070 --> 00:56:53,070
You see that little dip you know am and 
you see the little dip that their body 

1291
00:56:53,070 --> 00:56:53,070
goes and like,
oh,

1292
00:56:53,070 --> 00:56:53,710
this is not good.
And you got to think.

1293
00:56:53,711 --> 00:56:58,711
I've probably sparred with thousands and
thousands of different mma fighters and 

1294
00:56:58,711 --> 00:57:00,310
soon as we start sparring,
I'll tap the leg once,

1295
00:57:00,311 --> 00:57:02,120
tap the leg twice,
three times,

1296
00:57:02,121 --> 00:57:02,660
and they're like,
no,

1297
00:57:02,661 --> 00:57:02,870
no,
no.

1298
00:57:02,890 --> 00:57:04,450
Can you lay off the leg?
I was just like,

1299
00:57:04,710 --> 00:57:05,920
okay.
All right,

1300
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:06,730
cool.
Yeah,

1301
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:09,010
I guess so.
I'll just hit the other leg.

1302
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,500
The other leg will hit your body,
but I mean,

1303
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:12,350
yeah,
it's like,

1304
00:57:12,370 --> 00:57:14,500
it's a different type of body 
conditioning.

1305
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:18,640
Is there any way to do it other than 
just getting kicked there?

1306
00:57:18,641 --> 00:57:19,510
I mean,
does anybody.

1307
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:24,780
Not that I know.
I think it's just years of accumulation 

1308
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:28,090
bottles on their shannon's that I tried 
to find research on that.

1309
00:57:28,091 --> 00:57:29,950
I don't think so.
I don't think so.

1310
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:31,630
I did when I was young.
I'm like,

1311
00:57:31,631 --> 00:57:32,290
hey,
look at me.

1312
00:57:32,291 --> 00:57:37,291
I'm putting a rolling pin over my shin,
but I guess it kind of takes out that 

1313
00:57:37,291 --> 00:57:41,570
the nerve damage a little bit.
I don't know all the nerve endings and 

1314
00:57:41,570 --> 00:57:41,980
preventing shot to numb them out a bit.
Um,

1315
00:57:42,730 --> 00:57:43,870
I don't know.
Yeah,

1316
00:57:44,290 --> 00:57:45,130
it is interesting.

1317
00:57:45,130 --> 00:57:48,700
It's interesting because it's not,
it doesn't necessarily make sense.

1318
00:57:48,910 --> 00:57:51,610
Like when it comes to the muscle of the,
of the thighs,

1319
00:57:51,611 --> 00:57:56,611
like it's got to come down to nerve or 
because it's not really bone that's 

1320
00:57:56,611 --> 00:57:59,911
getting stronger.
I would love to talk to a doctor who 

1321
00:57:59,911 --> 00:58:02,680
understands moitai you.
Do you know anybody that's like a doctor

1322
00:58:02,681 --> 00:58:04,110
that train started.
I'll find out.

1323
00:58:04,111 --> 00:58:06,280
I'll tweet you out the answer and then 
I'll find it.

1324
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,200
Yeah.
Because it definitely seems like.

1325
00:58:08,201 --> 00:58:13,201
I mean especially like we said,
the ties and these guys that have 100 

1326
00:58:13,201 --> 00:58:16,141
plus fights and you see them getting low
kicked and it doesn't seem to affect 

1327
00:58:16,141 --> 00:58:16,141
them at all.
I mean it's landing.

1328
00:58:16,141 --> 00:58:21,001
It's an effective strike,
but the difference between the way it 

1329
00:58:21,001 --> 00:58:23,611
would affect them versus the way it 
affect a person's never been low kick 

1330
00:58:23,611 --> 00:58:23,611
before.
Yeah,

1331
00:58:23,611 --> 00:58:26,260
it's interesting.
It's the most underrated a technique and

1332
00:58:26,261 --> 00:58:27,100
all martial arts.

1333
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:29,470
I agree because until you've been low 
kicked,

1334
00:58:29,471 --> 00:58:31,060
like once you get low kicked,
once you go,

1335
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:32,700
oh jesus.
Anyway,

1336
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:33,410
it's usually,
it's,

1337
00:58:33,411 --> 00:58:38,411
it's those.
It's usually when you get those parties 

1338
00:58:38,411 --> 00:58:40,441
and you're drunk go those leg kicks her 
hurt and then all of a sudden they're 

1339
00:58:40,861 --> 00:58:41,800
like,
just give him one.

1340
00:58:41,801 --> 00:58:42,670
And I was like,
no,

1341
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:47,140
I was actually messing with someone once
and I was like,

1342
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:49,630
Bruce Lee had the one inch punch and I 
was like,

1343
00:58:49,631 --> 00:58:52,540
I'll give you a one inch low kick and 
you won't walk for a month.

1344
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:55,300
And he didn't believe it.
I'll give you,

1345
00:58:55,301 --> 00:58:58,570
I'll give anyone if anyone listening 
wants to have a one inch located.

1346
00:58:58,571 --> 00:58:59,800
How do you set it up?
What do you do?

1347
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:04,390
All they gotta do is put my literally my
shin one inch away and just bang done.

1348
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:07,450
So like it's hitting the right part.
You got to know where to hit.

1349
00:59:07,690 --> 00:59:09,540
So you would uh,
have like,

1350
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:12,610
almost like you're throwing a kick,
like a controlled kicking.

1351
00:59:12,611 --> 00:59:16,180
Stopping at.
I'll just go right on that part.

1352
00:59:17,150 --> 00:59:20,700
Tell any man new one inch low kicks.
I'm going to start it.

1353
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:25,860
You,
you should make a video about one inch 

1354
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:26,690
lower kicked challenge.
I bet you I'm going to do it now.

1355
00:59:26,990 --> 00:59:28,700
You were saying early on,
I wanted to go back to this,

1356
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:33,730
that your thoughts on fighting have 
changed from being a fighter to being a 

1357
00:59:33,730 --> 00:59:36,920
coach because I think right now I had,
when I was fighting,

1358
00:59:36,921 --> 00:59:38,750
I had to have a one dimensional 
approach.

1359
00:59:38,751 --> 00:59:42,950
What worked for me and now as a coach I,
someone asked me the question,

1360
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:48,760
you,
they're like a new student who's very 

1361
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:48,760
talented,
comes to your gym.

1362
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:50,060
He has,
he's not strong,

1363
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:55,480
he's not really as athletic as you.
He doesn't have the training background 

1364
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:55,490
as you.

1365
00:59:55,490 --> 00:59:57,260
How do you make that guy a world 
champion?

1366
00:59:58,850 --> 00:59:59,600
And I was like,
huh,

1367
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:00,680
that's interesting.
I'm like,

1368
01:00:00,710 --> 01:00:02,330
he's not big,
he's not strong.

1369
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:07,480
So he's not going to be a great pressure
fighter that's going to be able to 

1370
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:07,480
withstand a lot of damage.
So what happened?

1371
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:10,910
So I want it to create a system of 
fighting that is kind of universal.

1372
01:00:11,330 --> 01:00:12,740
Um,
I don't really want to have.

1373
01:00:12,741 --> 01:00:17,741
I want to have a system in my fighting 
at bazooka kickboxing that you can go 

1374
01:00:17,741 --> 01:00:19,190
onto a street fight,
you can go and do an mma fight,

1375
01:00:19,250 --> 01:00:24,250
you can kick box.
You got to have that knowledge and the 

1376
01:00:24,250 --> 01:00:26,891
skillset to be able to fight everything,
and that's my goal as a coach right now 

1377
01:00:26,891 --> 01:00:30,290
is to make a universal system that can 
handle anything.

1378
01:00:30,590 --> 01:00:32,600
So if you've got a pressure fight versus
move,

1379
01:00:32,601 --> 01:00:35,180
if you've got to keep distance,
if you need to jab or box,

1380
01:00:35,190 --> 01:00:36,320
you got to be able to have it all.

1381
01:00:36,590 --> 01:00:41,590
Um,
I don't agree anymore too much with a 

1382
01:00:41,590 --> 01:00:43,751
one dimensional approach,
but the one dimensional approach was 

1383
01:00:43,751 --> 01:00:46,571
good for you as a fighter because you 
found out where your skills in directed 

1384
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:47,990
you gotta.
Look,

1385
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:53,000
I,
the way I look at it as I wasn't an 

1386
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,031
exceptional case,
I'm an exceptional athlete that was 

1387
01:00:55,031 --> 01:00:55,820
gifted with a strong body,
strong mind,

1388
01:00:55,850 --> 01:00:58,490
good dedication,
a very motivated,

1389
01:00:58,491 --> 01:01:03,491
so it all worked in my favor,
but now I have a guy who was fighting 

1390
01:01:03,491 --> 01:01:06,880
amateur kickboxing.
How do I train that guy to be 

1391
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:09,941
successful?
Do you think that that helps you as a 

1392
01:01:09,941 --> 01:01:12,791
fighter?
Because he didn't know a lot of jujitsu 

1393
01:01:12,791 --> 01:01:15,191
guys.
They start coaching and once they start 

1394
01:01:15,191 --> 01:01:15,400
coaching and teaching lessons there,
joe,

1395
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:18,620
their game jUst jumps.
It was being a color commentator.

1396
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:20,390
That helps a lot.
He was like,

1397
01:01:20,391 --> 01:01:22,520
I got to show you like after or 
whatever.

1398
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:27,520
I'll show you my notes on what I do and 
I'd be interested to see your thoughts 

1399
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:27,560
on it.
Do you write your own notes for,

1400
01:01:27,610 --> 01:01:32,610
for the events?
We wrote notes as far as like your 

1401
01:01:32,610 --> 01:01:34,930
fighter notes or do you.
Are you now just experienced enough to 

1402
01:01:34,930 --> 01:01:37,691
know about the fighters?
It depends entirely on who the fighters 

1403
01:01:37,691 --> 01:01:41,261
either because many,
many times I'm watching the guy fight 

1404
01:01:41,261 --> 01:01:41,420
for the first time and if I've never 
seen someone before,

1405
01:01:41,450 --> 01:01:44,330
what I like to do is I like to watch 
some youtube videos of them,

1406
01:01:44,550 --> 01:01:47,960
like to watch him fight.
I read what their background is.

1407
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:50,010
So you do do a lot of research still you
have.

1408
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:55,780
See I say I do research.
I say I don't do any research because I 

1409
01:01:55,780 --> 01:01:56,600
would've done it anyway because like,
like,

1410
01:01:56,780 --> 01:01:58,850
like I'll do research for gloria.
I don't work for gloria.

1411
01:01:58,870 --> 01:01:59,990
Yeah.
But you still want.

1412
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:00,700
I'm saying.
Yeah.

1413
01:02:00,890 --> 01:02:02,210
So like your fence?
Yes.

1414
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:04,490
So it's like say if there's a big fight 
coming up,

1415
01:02:04,491 --> 01:02:06,710
like I'm like,
here's a perfect example,

1416
01:02:06,750 --> 01:02:07,320
this,
this,

1417
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:09,890
uh,
holly holm,

1418
01:02:09,891 --> 01:02:14,891
germane to random me.
They're going to fight for the ufc for 

1419
01:02:14,891 --> 01:02:14,891
that.
Yeah.

1420
01:02:14,891 --> 01:02:19,390
And what's interesting to me is germane 
to random randomize a multiple time 

1421
01:02:19,390 --> 01:02:20,010
world champion and who's had a hard time
dealing with the

1422
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:20,940
clench,
dealing with people,

1423
01:02:20,941 --> 01:02:23,110
taking her down,
dealing with the other aspects of them.

1424
01:02:23,190 --> 01:02:26,490
And she's trying to find our groove.
But as a dutch girl,

1425
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:30,090
nasty strike or real tall,
saw her was at ufc 200.

1426
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:36,510
Was she In the Brazil card with cyborg 
or something?

1427
01:02:36,511 --> 01:02:38,100
She'd like to vicious.
She's vicious.

1428
01:02:38,270 --> 01:02:39,900
She's very,
very good striker.

1429
01:02:40,050 --> 01:02:41,040
So what,
I'm curious.

1430
01:02:41,041 --> 01:02:43,500
It's very interesting because you know 
holly,

1431
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:48,680
who looked like a fucking dynamo when 
she fought ronda because ronda fought 

1432
01:02:48,781 --> 01:02:51,090
the absolute worst kind of fight.
You can fight with holly,

1433
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:56,120
run right at her.
You go straight go at her because she 

1434
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:56,580
didn't want her to bully her and you 
just can't,

1435
01:02:56,610 --> 01:02:57,270
you know,
holly,

1436
01:02:57,271 --> 01:03:02,271
so good at evasion.
So good at using angles and so good at 

1437
01:03:02,271 --> 01:03:02,930
stopping.
And then countering,

1438
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:07,030
punching straight punching and that,
that weird oblique kick that they,

1439
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:09,480
a lot of the winkle john guys like to do
to the thigh.

1440
01:03:09,510 --> 01:03:10,560
Do you use that?
Kick it off.

1441
01:03:10,930 --> 01:03:12,300
It's a weird kick,
right?

1442
01:03:12,870 --> 01:03:14,640
A lot of guys use that kick.
I mean,

1443
01:03:15,030 --> 01:03:15,840
have you,
um,

1444
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:16,860
you know,
um,

1445
01:03:16,990 --> 01:03:21,990
there's,
there's some guys that really know how 

1446
01:03:21,990 --> 01:03:21,990
to,
to,

1447
01:03:21,990 --> 01:03:23,700
to land that well,
and I'm starting to see it.

1448
01:03:23,701 --> 01:03:24,510
I'm thinking,
man,

1449
01:03:24,540 --> 01:03:26,430
it's um,
it's,

1450
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:28,260
it's,
it's an interesting kick.

1451
01:03:28,350 --> 01:03:31,350
But the john guys in particular,
gals too.

1452
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:33,960
Holly is really good at that.
It's like the front kick.

1453
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:38,940
It's when anderson silva knocked dell 
bell for and everyone was like,

1454
01:03:38,941 --> 01:03:40,050
whoa,
the front kick,

1455
01:03:40,051 --> 01:03:45,051
look at this amazing new weapon.
Like it'S probably the first kick ever 

1456
01:03:45,051 --> 01:03:48,420
taught in traditional martial arts.
It's just he made it so popular and then

1457
01:03:48,421 --> 01:03:53,421
all of a sudden you see it as a new 
trend where everyone started throwing 

1458
01:03:53,421 --> 01:03:56,301
front kicks to the face.
It became like a new popular little 

1459
01:03:56,301 --> 01:03:56,940
trend there for a little bit that hey 
look,

1460
01:03:56,941 --> 01:03:58,050
front kicks work again.

1461
01:03:58,050 --> 01:04:03,050
It's just they were forgotten about.
And that's what I'm hoping with the low 

1462
01:04:03,050 --> 01:04:03,330
kick they were forgotten about.
And then they come back.

1463
01:04:03,690 --> 01:04:08,690
Yeah,
I think there's room for a lot of 

1464
01:04:08,690 --> 01:04:08,730
different kicks in mma that aren't there
yet.

1465
01:04:08,820 --> 01:04:12,660
And one of them that we're seeing in 
some organizations is acs kicks.

1466
01:04:13,010 --> 01:04:18,010
And I saw some.
Well there was that guy that was 

1467
01:04:18,010 --> 01:04:19,570
fighting and mma for awhile.
It gfc adlon.

1468
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:23,760
I'm a gov.
Who's a wild fighter man.

1469
01:04:23,790 --> 01:04:28,050
And he now he retired.
he stopped fighting and mma.

1470
01:04:28,350 --> 01:04:33,350
But he was really talented man.
He knocked out it was tj walberger I 

1471
01:04:33,350 --> 01:04:36,600
believe in the ufc with an ax cake.
No,

1472
01:04:36,601 --> 01:04:41,601
he,
I forget what he kicked him with and 

1473
01:04:41,601 --> 01:04:41,601
punched him with too.
But he,

1474
01:04:41,601 --> 01:04:44,070
he had wicked kicks and incredible 
flexibility.

1475
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:49,280
So he had this ability to utilize 
techniques that you don't necessarily 

1476
01:04:50,011 --> 01:04:55,011
think of as knockout techniques,
but he would smash guys with acs kicks 

1477
01:04:55,011 --> 01:04:57,840
in front kicks and round kicks.
And just for those,

1478
01:04:57,841 --> 01:04:59,700
uh,
the kickboxing fans listening.

1479
01:04:59,730 --> 01:05:01,560
Andy hug.
Oh yeah,

1480
01:05:01,561 --> 01:05:03,900
yeah.
And hook kicks to the lay.

1481
01:05:03,910 --> 01:05:04,860
Yes.
Yeah.

1482
01:05:04,861 --> 01:05:07,410
There's a guy fighting on la.
I'm on the show.

1483
01:05:07,411 --> 01:05:09,660
You're at gudo.
Innosense he fought.

1484
01:05:10,350 --> 01:05:12,480
He fought in the ufc twice.
Yeah.

1485
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:17,660
He fought in strikeforce ones.
He has a kickboxing finish with a 

1486
01:05:17,660 --> 01:05:17,810
spinning heel kick to

1487
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:19,080
it.
Yeah.

1488
01:05:19,270 --> 01:05:21,220
Yeah.
His wheel kicks are nasty man.

1489
01:05:21,260 --> 01:05:26,260
All all.
What about that other kid on the last 

1490
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:26,260
few years?
It rodriguez.

1491
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:28,090
Wow.
Wow.

1492
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:29,230
That was hard to watch.
Yeah,

1493
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:31,660
it was very tough to watch.
But the kids incredible.

1494
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:33,400
Oh,
he threesixty roundhouse kick.

1495
01:05:33,401 --> 01:05:36,910
Bj penn in the face.
I don't know how bj didn't go down.

1496
01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:40,360
I'll be just got an iron chin man.
Lorens larkin.

1497
01:05:40,390 --> 01:05:45,390
Pull up lorens larkin versus who did 
these stop?

1498
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:52,150
What does lauren's larkin's god dammit.
WhY can't I remember this right now?

1499
01:05:52,870 --> 01:05:54,070
John howard?
No.

1500
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:54,710
Nope.
Okay.

1501
01:05:55,210 --> 01:05:59,260
Lorenzo larkin's recent fights.
Neil magni.

1502
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:01,750
Jesus christ.
Pull up a lorenz larkin.

1503
01:06:01,751 --> 01:06:02,750
Neil magnet,
because I want.

1504
01:06:02,770 --> 01:06:05,960
I want to show them that oblique kick to
the body and what am I.

1505
01:06:06,010 --> 01:06:08,110
My guys out there that's In the 
greenroom.

1506
01:06:08,140 --> 01:06:13,140
Matt special.
He actually sent me the fight and have 

1507
01:06:13,140 --> 01:06:15,121
it was too busy with glory notes,
but he sent me that exact fight to 

1508
01:06:15,121 --> 01:06:15,121
watch.

1509
01:06:15,121 --> 01:06:18,250
Lauren's larkin's a motherfucker.
He's really good and his.

1510
01:06:18,310 --> 01:06:20,800
He does a lot of spinning wheel kicks to
the thigh to.

1511
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:23,440
He does a lot of wild shit.
Why not?

1512
01:06:23,441 --> 01:06:26,980
I think any kid should Be able to be 
thrown at different levels for sure.

1513
01:06:27,010 --> 01:06:28,900
And that's what makes that kIck more 
effective.

1514
01:06:29,350 --> 01:06:32,320
If you're constantly going at one level,
it becomes easy to defend.

1515
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:34,300
So you got to change the levels.
That's why.

1516
01:06:34,301 --> 01:06:38,020
Same thing as southpaws guys don't kick 
enough for myself,

1517
01:06:38,021 --> 01:06:39,010
paul.
Um,

1518
01:06:39,130 --> 01:06:41,140
or If they do,
it's constantly one.

1519
01:06:41,310 --> 01:06:44,110
It's either the inside leg,
they're not attacking the back legs,

1520
01:06:44,111 --> 01:06:45,130
the bodies,
the head.

1521
01:06:45,131 --> 01:06:50,131
You got to change levels.
Not enough self paws are changing 

1522
01:06:50,131 --> 01:06:50,131
levels.
With that left kick,

1523
01:06:50,131 --> 01:06:53,170
do you experiment or use any traditional
martial arts techniques?

1524
01:06:53,171 --> 01:06:55,320
Like do you ever throw sidekicks or 
spinning kicks?

1525
01:06:55,610 --> 01:06:57,680
Not anymore.
I've,

1526
01:06:57,690 --> 01:07:02,690
I've really taken like,
I've really been taught to keep really 

1527
01:07:02,690 --> 01:07:05,830
tight on a shield,
but now my whole style has actually been

1528
01:07:05,831 --> 01:07:08,090
trying to like add dimensions to it.

1529
01:07:08,090 --> 01:07:10,120
So I've been boxing a lot more and even 
though,

1530
01:07:10,121 --> 01:07:11,210
yeah,
I've had the concussion,

1531
01:07:11,211 --> 01:07:13,300
it doesn't mean I stopped being a 
martial artist.

1532
01:07:13,540 --> 01:07:16,390
This is when my real martial arts 
training has evolved.

1533
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:18,070
UM,
when I was fighting,

1534
01:07:18,071 --> 01:07:19,900
I couldn't do all this stuff.
When I was fighting,

1535
01:07:19,901 --> 01:07:21,640
I didn't have tiMe to sit there.
Like for exAmple,

1536
01:07:21,641 --> 01:07:25,870
the last three months I fought southpaw,
I've been training self paul just to.

1537
01:07:25,871 --> 01:07:29,140
It's a new dimension to my game.
so now's the time.

1538
01:07:29,141 --> 01:07:31,510
I get to be a full time martial artists 
and learn.

1539
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:34,060
Watch how he throws this oblique kick to
the body,

1540
01:07:34,061 --> 01:07:36,040
back up a little bit because this is the
end of the fight.

1541
01:07:36,410 --> 01:07:38,320
He's setting it up with the low kick.
Well,

1542
01:07:38,321 --> 01:07:43,321
he sets it up with everything,
but it's what's interesting is the 

1543
01:07:43,321 --> 01:07:43,840
distance where he throws this oblique 
kick,

1544
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:45,430
he throws it like right there.

1545
01:07:45,490 --> 01:07:46,750
Boom.
I see how he throws it.

1546
01:07:46,751 --> 01:07:49,520
It's crazy.
Yeah.

1547
01:07:50,050 --> 01:07:51,980
Heel and toe out.
And uh,

1548
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,330
he,
he's so fast.

1549
01:07:53,331 --> 01:07:53,650
well,
you know,

1550
01:07:53,651 --> 01:07:58,651
I liked that because if the elbows in 
gets the foot probably just outside of 

1551
01:07:58,651 --> 01:08:03,151
the elbow or inside,
it kind of follows the inside forearm 

1552
01:08:03,151 --> 01:08:03,151
nicely.
Yeah.

1553
01:08:03,151 --> 01:08:06,870
Lorenzo is the best I've ever seen a 
throwing that kick and throwing it right

1554
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:08,380
in there.
tried right there.

1555
01:08:08,381 --> 01:08:10,900
I miss,
but he throws it from tight quarters and

1556
01:08:10,901 --> 01:08:13,030
guys think he's gonna throw low kick.
So he missed it,

1557
01:08:13,031 --> 01:08:16,070
mixes it up with that.
He's using the kick and

1558
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:18,270
then he sets it up with,
you know,

1559
01:08:18,290 --> 01:08:21,470
with either the oblique kick or the low 
kick and he constantly varies.

1560
01:08:21,471 --> 01:08:23,780
Um,
[inaudible] that kicked traditionally is

1561
01:08:23,781 --> 01:08:25,220
meant to hit with the heel,
right?

1562
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:26,210
Yeah.
Yeah.

1563
01:08:26,260 --> 01:08:28,850
I mean he's hitting him with the heel,
but it's um,

1564
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:31,370
it's so weird to look at because you're 
like,

1565
01:08:31,430 --> 01:08:36,430
oh yeah,
you can do that to this setup is unreal 

1566
01:08:36,430 --> 01:08:36,430
with the low kick there.
Yes.

1567
01:08:36,430 --> 01:08:36,680
Yes.
It's set up is great.

1568
01:08:36,950 --> 01:08:39,800
And this was a great fight for him 
because,

1569
01:08:40,070 --> 01:08:45,070
you know,
I knew lawrence was super talented 

1570
01:08:45,070 --> 01:08:47,410
before this,
but neil magnum was a highly rated guy 

1571
01:08:47,410 --> 01:08:49,310
and lauren just ran through them.
I mean is the difference in the striking

1572
01:08:49,340 --> 01:08:51,740
magnet is a really good all around 
fighter.

1573
01:08:51,770 --> 01:08:55,160
He's really well rounded.
He's got incredible endurance,

1574
01:08:55,430 --> 01:08:58,700
but what lorenzo was able to do is avoid
all this stuff,

1575
01:08:58,730 --> 01:09:01,590
avoid the ground game,
keep the fight in his wheelhouse,

1576
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:04,730
which is in the standup,
and just show how much more technical he

1577
01:09:04,731 --> 01:09:07,760
is on his feet and how much quicker he 
is a closing the gap.

1578
01:09:07,780 --> 01:09:09,800
I didn't have any staying long too,
right?

1579
01:09:09,850 --> 01:09:11,930
Yeah,
and he's fighting a tall guy too.

1580
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:13,910
Yeah.
If you think about it,

1581
01:09:13,970 --> 01:09:18,970
if larkin's got the shorter arms,
why is he going to sit there and want a 

1582
01:09:18,970 --> 01:09:22,361
box with a guy with longer arms?
You've got to change your distance and 

1583
01:09:22,361 --> 01:09:23,480
the low kicks.
Perfect work setup perfectly.

1584
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:25,730
Now back to.
That's it.

1585
01:09:25,970 --> 01:09:28,760
now,
back to moitai and elbows.

1586
01:09:28,940 --> 01:09:33,170
Don't you think that elbows are the.
Well obviously they're really effective,

1587
01:09:34,050 --> 01:09:39,050
you know,
and elbows and elbows from the clinch 

1588
01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:41,441
and needs from the clench.
Obviously you're really effective 

1589
01:09:41,441 --> 01:09:43,601
techniques.
Why do you like rules that don't have 

1590
01:09:43,601 --> 01:09:43,930
those?
I remember listening to your podcast and

1591
01:09:43,931 --> 01:09:48,931
someone asked,
I think you were talking about how you 

1592
01:09:48,931 --> 01:09:49,340
feel more tie is like the purest art of 
stand up fighting.

1593
01:09:49,580 --> 01:09:51,440
I think it's.
It makes sense.

1594
01:09:51,450 --> 01:09:53,540
Yeah.
I like all fighting.

1595
01:09:53,630 --> 01:09:55,040
I like mma,
you know,

1596
01:09:55,041 --> 01:10:00,041
obviously love it.
I think mma is probably my favorite 

1597
01:10:00,041 --> 01:10:02,591
thing to watch,
but what I like about moitai is when 

1598
01:10:02,591 --> 01:10:06,671
you're seeing the clench,
your using all the potential weapons 

1599
01:10:06,671 --> 01:10:08,690
from inside that position.
Whereas in kickboxinG they will separate

1600
01:10:08,691 --> 01:10:10,730
you.
It's just for me personally,

1601
01:10:10,731 --> 01:10:13,400
why I don't like to clinch it slows the 
fight down.

1602
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:18,880
I'm not saying it's because you can be a
crappy outside fighter but be so strong 

1603
01:10:19,911 --> 01:10:22,580
and dominant and the clinton winning all
your fights in the clench.

1604
01:10:22,670 --> 01:10:23,420
Right?
So,

1605
01:10:23,421 --> 01:10:28,421
I mean I think it's just a rule set and 
I mean each guy's going to be different 

1606
01:10:29,090 --> 01:10:30,800
from what they're good at or not good 
at.

1607
01:10:31,190 --> 01:10:32,330
Um,
and it's how you train,

1608
01:10:32,331 --> 01:10:35,000
but you have to change your style.
You have to change.

1609
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:39,860
Like even if I were to fight,
we talked about kickboxing and mma.

1610
01:10:40,010 --> 01:10:42,890
You have to change your style,
but even if you fight between kickboxing

1611
01:10:42,891 --> 01:10:44,810
and muay thai,
you have to change quite a bit.

1612
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:47,330
You have to stay longer.
If you're a fighter like myself,

1613
01:10:47,331 --> 01:10:50,210
who doesn't want to get into the clinch,
you have to fight differently.

1614
01:10:50,211 --> 01:10:52,460
You have to use triangle stepping in 
your foot work.

1615
01:10:52,670 --> 01:10:55,070
You got to use more distance.
You got to stay away.

1616
01:10:55,340 --> 01:11:00,340
I could maybe only throw a a two or 
three hit combination before I have to 

1617
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:04,031
exit and move again because I know he's 
going to try to grab me and cleanse me 

1618
01:11:04,031 --> 01:11:04,790
and you know,
slice me up with his elbows.

1619
01:11:04,930 --> 01:11:09,930
Is there a more difficult transItion,
like do you think that the transition 

1620
01:11:09,930 --> 01:11:11,960
between kickboxing and muay thai is more
difficult or the transition between more

1621
01:11:11,961 --> 01:11:13,920
thai and kickboxing?
Because we're seeing a lot of

1622
01:11:14,140 --> 01:11:16,590
moitai champions that are now entering 
into kickbox.

1623
01:11:16,591 --> 01:11:19,950
I'm going to more tie more and more 
difficult.

1624
01:11:19,951 --> 01:11:24,951
It's more difficult because you're 
adding all these new weapons so you're 

1625
01:11:25,511 --> 01:11:30,511
in all of a sudden now have these 
weapons that you're not used to wear 

1626
01:11:30,511 --> 01:11:31,920
with more.
Tie your kind of take away some,

1627
01:11:31,921 --> 01:11:36,921
but you still have your other weapons 
that are effective and it had this 

1628
01:11:36,921 --> 01:11:36,921
conversation with a lot of the more tie 
fighters.

1629
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:42,020
They were saying how you got to look at 
the success of more tIe fighters and 

1630
01:11:42,020 --> 01:11:42,770
kick with boxing.
You have sit.

1631
01:11:42,771 --> 01:11:44,580
A chai sits on,
been on.

1632
01:11:44,610 --> 01:11:49,610
who's a savage,
he's the current lightweight champion 

1633
01:11:49,610 --> 01:11:53,890
fighters like sand chai,
moitai legend came in and his first 

1634
01:11:53,890 --> 01:11:57,240
kickboxing fight dominated this young 
thai kid that just came in and France.

1635
01:11:57,241 --> 01:12:01,070
I'm a pet panda maroon,
can't move cow.

1636
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:03,580
He came in and just left,
kicked one weapon,

1637
01:12:03,581 --> 01:12:07,030
shut down a an aggressive punch to low 
kick,

1638
01:12:07,070 --> 01:12:08,670
just one kick left,
kick left,

1639
01:12:08,671 --> 01:12:09,210
kick,
left,

1640
01:12:09,211 --> 01:12:09,450
kick.

1641
01:12:09,930 --> 01:12:12,120
And these guys have been fighting for so
long.

1642
01:12:12,121 --> 01:12:17,121
It's fighting to them.
Fighting at the end of the day is still 

1643
01:12:17,121 --> 01:12:17,121
fighting.
Um,

1644
01:12:17,121 --> 01:12:21,141
so these thai guys and who were 
following traditional moitai are still 

1645
01:12:21,141 --> 01:12:24,861
being very successful and kickboxing and
one of the basic workout you can 

1646
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:28,350
dominated dog house is a great example 
of it.

1647
01:12:28,351 --> 01:12:32,000
And still around to sanchez.
Really interesting because he's a,

1648
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:33,840
she wants his glory for.
Yes I did.

1649
01:12:34,060 --> 01:12:35,100
Alright.
he's fun to watch,

1650
01:12:35,101 --> 01:12:35,820
man.
Oh yeah.

1651
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:37,550
Tricky slipping.
He'll fly.

1652
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:38,670
Big guys,
small guys.

1653
01:12:38,671 --> 01:12:40,080
He wanted to.
he put a hole,

1654
01:12:40,081 --> 01:12:44,100
a social media campaign to fight conor 
mcgregor in mma.

1655
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:45,750
Yeah,
I think so.

1656
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:47,980
Does he know how to wrestle?
No.

1657
01:12:48,380 --> 01:12:53,380
No luck with all that.
what's your thoughts on conor and floyd?

1658
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:57,140
That's a big thing right now.
Could that even happen?

1659
01:12:57,610 --> 01:12:58,980
Could it happen?
Yeah.

1660
01:12:59,070 --> 01:13:01,290
Floyd is a.
I like again,

1661
01:13:01,380 --> 01:13:03,750
the best defensive fighter ever and you 
know,

1662
01:13:03,770 --> 01:13:08,770
I mean in a straight boxing match,
you've got to give the advantage of him 

1663
01:13:08,770 --> 01:13:08,770
and just have to.

1664
01:13:08,770 --> 01:13:12,950
You have to.
The traditional wisdom would say that 

1665
01:13:12,950 --> 01:13:14,700
he's gonna box connor's face off.
That's true.

1666
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:16,740
You would look at it and you would look 
at what he's been able to do,

1667
01:13:16,741 --> 01:13:21,330
but conner's a fucking freak man.
He's a weird guy.

1668
01:13:21,390 --> 01:13:25,680
He's got his mind is so fucking strong 
and he eats pressure.

1669
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:28,620
He just eats it.
Like when he stepped into that ring with

1670
01:13:28,621 --> 01:13:33,621
josie aldo,
he looked like he didn't have a care in 

1671
01:13:33,621 --> 01:13:34,050
the world.
You need that confidence and that belief

1672
01:13:34,051 --> 01:13:39,051
men is just staggering and he had talked
so much shit for so long and aldo was 

1673
01:13:39,931 --> 01:13:44,931
just fuming.
He was steaming at the bank when he got 

1674
01:13:44,931 --> 01:13:47,721
in there,
he was so emotionally invested in that 

1675
01:13:47,721 --> 01:13:50,181
fight.
It was almost like he had never been 

1676
01:13:50,181 --> 01:13:51,450
disrespected like that and to be 
disrespected for months.

1677
01:13:52,020 --> 01:13:57,020
I mean they had done this huge world 
tour where connor stole his belt at a 

1678
01:13:57,020 --> 01:13:59,490
press conference and was yelling at him 
and I mean it was madness.

1679
01:13:59,490 --> 01:14:04,490
And then to have the fight and then 
connor starches him with one punch 13 

1680
01:14:04,490 --> 01:14:05,250
seconds into the fight.
Like wow.

1681
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:06,000
Yeah.
that,

1682
01:14:06,140 --> 01:14:10,440
that,
that stirred up a lot of attention.

1683
01:14:10,470 --> 01:14:14,050
Obviously floyd is not jose aldo.
Floyd is,

1684
01:14:14,140 --> 01:14:14,750
you know,
it's,

1685
01:14:14,780 --> 01:14:17,350
it would be a boxing match in an mma 
match.

1686
01:14:17,351 --> 01:14:19,180
Connor would fucking kill him for sure.
Anyway,

1687
01:14:19,190 --> 01:14:20,180
to kill him.
He kicked it.

1688
01:14:20,270 --> 01:14:23,860
shit wouldn't even flow.
Would never get close to,

1689
01:14:23,861 --> 01:14:24,300
um,
conduct,

1690
01:14:24,310 --> 01:14:26,680
kicked his fucking legs out from under 
them every time.

1691
01:14:26,710 --> 01:14:27,330
Yeah.
It would be,

1692
01:14:27,340 --> 01:14:30,100
it would be brutal.
But in a boxing match,

1693
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:32,040
one thing that connor's has got going 
for me,

1694
01:14:32,050 --> 01:14:33,220
he said,
way bigger guy.

1695
01:14:33,580 --> 01:14:34,390
He's,
I mean,

1696
01:14:34,391 --> 01:14:36,580
I know he fought at 1:45,
but jesus christ,

1697
01:14:36,581 --> 01:14:38,650
he looked like a dead man when he made 
45.

1698
01:14:38,890 --> 01:14:41,020
His shoulders are broad,
like he's.

1699
01:14:41,050 --> 01:14:46,050
Yeah,
he's walking around and one 70 ish 

1700
01:14:46,050 --> 01:14:46,050
somewhere around then.

1701
01:14:46,050 --> 01:14:46,270
And I don't think floyd is floyd is a 
smaller guy.

1702
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:51,960
And again,
what you were saying about with 

1703
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:51,960
kickboxing,
I think the same holds true with boxing,

1704
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:56,131
that those fighters,
they're not cutting the kind of weight 

1705
01:14:56,131 --> 01:14:56,380
that mma fighters are cutting.
So I don't know what they would weigh in

1706
01:14:56,381 --> 01:15:01,381
at.
I would assume it'd probably be like 

1707
01:15:01,381 --> 01:15:01,381
1:55
somewhere around there.

1708
01:15:01,381 --> 01:15:03,220
And then once they got into the octagon 
or the ring rather,

1709
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:07,060
it would be a boxing match.
Floyd would probably have a disadvantage

1710
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:09,890
weight-wise of somewhere around 15 
pounds.

1711
01:15:09,910 --> 01:15:10,600
Yeah.
No,

1712
01:15:10,870 --> 01:15:13,240
I can't see it happening.
But if they did,

1713
01:15:13,450 --> 01:15:17,170
floyd look canelo had a big weight 
advantage over him in that fight too.

1714
01:15:17,171 --> 01:15:19,660
And floyd shut that shit down.
You know,

1715
01:15:19,690 --> 01:15:21,340
he's just,
he's so good at boxing,

1716
01:15:21,341 --> 01:15:22,660
man.
he's just so good.

1717
01:15:22,661 --> 01:15:27,661
He's so grateful.
The more I follow and train and learn 

1718
01:15:27,661 --> 01:15:30,370
boxing I something I wish I started a 
lot earlier on in my career.

1719
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,550
It's men,
it's like you only have two weapons,

1720
01:15:33,940 --> 01:15:38,940
you know,
and you all of a sudden have to make 

1721
01:15:38,940 --> 01:15:39,410
this complex strategy through,
you know,

1722
01:15:39,670 --> 01:15:43,360
creating openings and with kicks you 
have a whole other dimension.

1723
01:15:43,361 --> 01:15:44,110
Elbows,
clinic.

1724
01:15:44,111 --> 01:15:47,710
But with boxing man he got two fists 
that you have to make land.

1725
01:15:47,860 --> 01:15:50,590
It's tough and I get why it's called the
sweet science.

1726
01:15:50,650 --> 01:15:53,540
Now when you are training,
are you sparring a right?

1727
01:15:53,570 --> 01:15:54,040
Yeah,
I do,

1728
01:15:54,100 --> 01:15:56,560
but I make sure I spar with the right 
guys and that kind of thing,

1729
01:15:56,561 --> 01:15:59,530
but I still do spar.
And are you worried at all about getting

1730
01:15:59,531 --> 01:16:02,260
hit when you're doing this?
Yes and no.

1731
01:16:02,710 --> 01:16:04,030
Yes.
And they just love it too much.

1732
01:16:04,031 --> 01:16:05,240
I just love it man.
I just,

1733
01:16:05,580 --> 01:16:08,260
I'm not stupid.
And that's the last thing you could ever

1734
01:16:08,261 --> 01:16:10,420
call me.
I do everything very calculated,

1735
01:16:10,421 --> 01:16:12,760
very smart.
So if I know there's an issue,

1736
01:16:13,060 --> 01:16:18,060
I slow it down or if there's an 
aggressive guy but I still spar and I 

1737
01:16:18,060 --> 01:16:20,120
still start very controlled and I could 
pick it up if I want.

1738
01:16:20,140 --> 01:16:25,140
It's just why was the question.
Sometimes I don't need to get in there 

1739
01:16:25,140 --> 01:16:27,460
and have those sparring matches where 
I'm trying to take the guy's head off.

1740
01:16:27,461 --> 01:16:32,461
It just doesn't make any sense.
Well the obviously the consequences for 

1741
01:16:32,461 --> 01:16:32,920
you are so much more obvious and 
intense,

1742
01:16:33,010 --> 01:16:34,870
you know,
knowing what you've been through.

1743
01:16:34,871 --> 01:16:38,650
I mean is that in the back of your head 
at all while you're doing it sometimes.

1744
01:16:39,370 --> 01:16:44,370
What's,
what's your take on these fighters 

1745
01:16:44,370 --> 01:16:45,370
taking a new approach on a not sparring 
anymore?

1746
01:16:46,030 --> 01:16:51,030
Well,
donald cerrone is taken that approach 

1747
01:16:51,030 --> 01:16:53,700
and it seems really effective for him,
but I think part of what's doing well 

1748
01:16:53,700 --> 01:16:58,171
for him.
I mean obviously he has excellent 

1749
01:16:58,171 --> 01:17:00,061
timing.
Obviously he's very experienced as a 

1750
01:17:00,061 --> 01:17:00,061
fighter already and he likes to stay 
active,

1751
01:17:00,061 --> 01:17:03,040
but his take on it was that he was 
beating himself up too much in the gym.

1752
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:08,040
Then he was firing too many hard rounds 
and he would go into these fights 

1753
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:08,040
already damaged.
He just couldn't take shots.

1754
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:09,440
Well,
that's the philosophy and moitai.

1755
01:17:09,441 --> 01:17:14,441
They don't really spar hard in in 
Thailand because they fight very often 

1756
01:17:14,441 --> 01:17:16,070
too,
but if you're not fighting very often,

1757
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:18,590
would you need that sparring?
It's a good question.

1758
01:17:18,710 --> 01:17:22,940
I think their spa,
there's stupid sparring and then there's

1759
01:17:22,941 --> 01:17:27,941
quality sparring.
I think there's so many different ways 

1760
01:17:27,941 --> 01:17:30,851
to spar.
If you're constantly going in there and 

1761
01:17:30,851 --> 01:17:30,851
you're trying to slug it out and getting
sloppy,

1762
01:17:30,851 --> 01:17:30,851
that's not good sparring.
Right,

1763
01:17:30,851 --> 01:17:35,770
so you can get a good guy.
That kind of really sets his shots up 

1764
01:17:35,770 --> 01:17:36,830
really good.
Goes hard to the body and low kicks.

1765
01:17:36,831 --> 01:17:41,831
When I spar,
my guys were trying to take each other 

1766
01:17:41,831 --> 01:17:44,141
out with body shots and low kicks,
like if I finished my training partner 

1767
01:17:44,141 --> 01:17:44,480
to the body,
I feel like the king.

1768
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:47,330
You know what I mean?
I walk around and just like walking,

1769
01:17:47,331 --> 01:17:50,300
like I owned the place mat to the body,
to the body,

1770
01:17:50,301 --> 01:17:51,770
low kicks.
Those are okay,

1771
01:17:51,771 --> 01:17:53,720
but you don't need to finish guys to the
head inspiring.

1772
01:17:54,050 --> 01:17:55,250
That's the dutch way,
right?

1773
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:57,470
They go 100 percent of the legs into the
bottom.

1774
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:00,170
Speaking to some of the dutch guys like 
jason wellness,

1775
01:18:00,171 --> 01:18:05,171
who's fighting.
His coach was telling me they do 

1776
01:18:05,171 --> 01:18:05,810
somewhere along the lines of 50 rounds 
of sparring a week.

1777
01:18:05,900 --> 01:18:07,190
Jesus christ.
Yeah.

1778
01:18:07,490 --> 01:18:09,320
That's a lot like,
again,

1779
01:18:09,350 --> 01:18:11,600
I don't know how intense are the types 
of shots,

1780
01:18:11,601 --> 01:18:14,120
but they rely a lot on sparring.
Well,

1781
01:18:14,121 --> 01:18:16,580
wildernesses fight with simon marcus.
What a fight.

1782
01:18:16,581 --> 01:18:19,910
That was jesus christ.
That was an amazing fight.

1783
01:18:20,450 --> 01:18:23,820
And simon marcus looks so fucking good 
in the beginning of first.

1784
01:18:24,530 --> 01:18:26,600
Oh my god,
he was just exploding,

1785
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:31,960
but it seemed like he drained his gas 
tank and got too cocky with that head 

1786
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:32,060
movement.

1787
01:18:32,150 --> 01:18:33,080
Yeah.
What was that about?

1788
01:18:33,081 --> 01:18:35,690
Like he,
he at one point in the fight,

1789
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:40,720
like almost like invited him to punch 
him and just kind of moved his head a 

1790
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:41,180
little bit and then they gave him a 
count for that too.

1791
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:42,730
Yeah.
And then I don't,

1792
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:46,190
I wouldn't have called that one account,
but the referee did a good stop on that.

1793
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:48,620
Wellness was just unloading.
Well,

1794
01:18:48,621 --> 01:18:53,621
it definitely under stoppage,
but it seemed like when they gave my 

1795
01:18:53,621 --> 01:18:56,351
account,
maybe the referee was seeing some shit 

1796
01:18:56,351 --> 01:18:56,660
we weren't seeing because it seemed like
simon,

1797
01:18:56,750 --> 01:18:59,010
like from that point on started to 
wither.

1798
01:18:59,270 --> 01:19:01,490
Yeah,
that was crazy.

1799
01:19:01,491 --> 01:19:04,100
Because you look how good he looked at 
the beginning of that fight.

1800
01:19:04,101 --> 01:19:08,360
He was blasting those kicks in.
It's like jesus and he was fucking going

1801
01:19:08,361 --> 01:19:08,990
for it,
man.

1802
01:19:08,991 --> 01:19:13,991
Which is when you look at simon,
he's so shredded a specimen and his 

1803
01:19:15,351 --> 01:19:17,890
style is so predicated on that.

1804
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:22,610
We're reliant on that.
He's just yells In the ring,

1805
01:19:22,611 --> 01:19:23,150
like,
yeah,

1806
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:24,620
yeah,
intense.

1807
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:26,830
But he just couldn't keep it up.
Man.

1808
01:19:26,850 --> 01:19:31,850
Couldn't keep that pace up,
but this is why I liked this fight with 

1809
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:31,850
tanya.
Did you ever see Israel stuff?

1810
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:33,830
They call the style of vendor?
Yeah.

1811
01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:35,360
is all low.
Like wicked.

1812
01:19:35,630 --> 01:19:39,620
He's throwing the low line technical 
good distance control southpaw,

1813
01:19:39,621 --> 01:19:42,710
orthodox spin kick boxes.
He's good.

1814
01:19:42,860 --> 01:19:47,860
He's a paper.
That is the style to beat that dutch 

1815
01:19:47,860 --> 01:19:48,950
style.
Straightforward fighting.

1816
01:19:49,010 --> 01:19:50,600
Right?
And you want to fight on angles.

1817
01:19:50,601 --> 01:19:52,310
Use distance,
use movement.

1818
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:55,130
Where how do you beat someone like style
bender?

1819
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:57,230
Constant pressure.
You know,

1820
01:19:57,231 --> 01:19:59,540
head to head fighting,
low kicks,

1821
01:19:59,660 --> 01:20:04,660
so you're going to see wilderness,
try to use that head to head pressure 

1822
01:20:04,660 --> 01:20:07,541
fighting like we saw with me and Raymond
Daniels versus I decided to try to use 

1823
01:20:07,541 --> 01:20:09,480
movement on the outside,
pick his shots,

1824
01:20:09,481 --> 01:20:10,290
fight on angles.

1825
01:20:10,290 --> 01:20:15,290
So on paper.
both of these guys have the style to 

1826
01:20:15,290 --> 01:20:18,501
beat one another.
I think that's why that fights super 

1827
01:20:18,501 --> 01:20:20,460
exciting for me to watch.
Well a style bender has been toying with

1828
01:20:20,461 --> 01:20:25,461
the idea of fighting and mma to and I'm 
really interested to know and I'm toying

1829
01:20:25,951 --> 01:20:27,500
with the idea of fighting the ufc I 
should say,

1830
01:20:27,890 --> 01:20:32,890
and I'm really wanted to see like how he
manages training and competing in both 

1831
01:20:33,061 --> 01:20:35,910
sports because that was a giant issue 
with joe schilling.

1832
01:20:36,170 --> 01:20:41,170
You know,
joe schilling was trying to do both 

1833
01:20:41,170 --> 01:20:41,170
little time when he just decided that,
you know,

1834
01:20:41,170 --> 01:20:45,590
it's just not really smart and wasn't.
He wasn't able to fight to his best 

1835
01:20:45,590 --> 01:20:47,550
ability in mma.
No.

1836
01:20:47,820 --> 01:20:49,740
Too many limits,
you know,

1837
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:51,660
and you don't have much time.
He's in his thirties,

1838
01:20:52,620 --> 01:20:54,210
you know,
how much time is there in a day?

1839
01:20:54,211 --> 01:20:55,410
How much time is there in your life?

1840
01:20:55,430 --> 01:21:00,430
I mean,
if you want to be excellent at one 

1841
01:21:00,430 --> 01:21:00,430
thing,
it's a lot.

1842
01:21:00,430 --> 01:21:00,870
That's why if you're a real 
perfectionist and it.

1843
01:21:00,930 --> 01:21:01,840
It's tough.
Yeah.

1844
01:21:02,220 --> 01:21:06,420
And you have to be okay with not being 
excellent at everything.

1845
01:21:06,550 --> 01:21:11,550
Yeah.
And that's a hard concept for martial 

1846
01:21:11,550 --> 01:21:11,580
artist and an athlete to be like,
hey look,

1847
01:21:11,581 --> 01:21:16,581
you know,
you're striking is just going to be 

1848
01:21:16,581 --> 01:21:16,581
okay,
but we gotta work on your ground,

1849
01:21:16,581 --> 01:21:19,881
so don't worry about your striking now 
there's only so much time in a day you 

1850
01:21:19,881 --> 01:21:23,241
can do training.
That's a really interesting thing that 

1851
01:21:23,241 --> 01:21:25,371
you just said.
You have to be really okay at that 

1852
01:21:25,371 --> 01:21:28,701
because like if you do jujitsu,
you're gonna get strangled by black 

1853
01:21:28,701 --> 01:21:28,701
belts,
but you go,

1854
01:21:28,701 --> 01:21:32,631
well,
if we were kickbox I'd fuck that dude 

1855
01:21:32,631 --> 01:21:32,631
up.
Exactly.

1856
01:21:32,631 --> 01:21:32,631
And you have to have that in your head.
But then again,

1857
01:21:32,631 --> 01:21:37,181
you know,
if you're doing kickbox and with a guy 

1858
01:21:37,181 --> 01:21:37,181
like bull cow,
you know,

1859
01:21:37,181 --> 01:21:37,181
like,
well,

1860
01:21:37,181 --> 01:21:37,230
you know,
you're not as good as him.

1861
01:21:37,230 --> 01:21:42,230
I kicked butt.
I'm fucking take his ass down and can't 

1862
01:21:42,230 --> 01:21:42,230
keep gotta be okay with it.
Well,

1863
01:21:42,230 --> 01:21:43,320
that was one of the things that george 
was so amazing at.

1864
01:21:43,380 --> 01:21:47,880
St pierre was so amazing at being able 
to do whatever he wanted to.

1865
01:21:47,910 --> 01:21:49,740
Dependent upon what you thought he was 
going to do.

1866
01:21:49,770 --> 01:21:54,770
Oh,
he was definitely above average and 

1867
01:21:54,770 --> 01:21:56,361
everything.
But you put george st pierre and a 

1868
01:21:56,361 --> 01:21:56,361
kickboxing fight.
Yeah,

1869
01:21:56,361 --> 01:21:58,030
it wouldn't be.
Would it be the best?

1870
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,780
But I mean,
he's great.

1871
01:22:01,020 --> 01:22:03,610
He's phenomenal at everything else.
Well,

1872
01:22:03,650 --> 01:22:05,250
I think that's what made him so 
dominant.

1873
01:22:05,251 --> 01:22:07,640
He's above average on everything.
Yeah.

1874
01:22:07,950 --> 01:22:08,760
Yep.
Yeah.

1875
01:22:08,850 --> 01:22:11,490
And also incredibly unpredictable and 
creative.

1876
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:16,520
That was one of the best things.
One of the most athletic guys I've seen 

1877
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:16,520
in the sport.
Yeah.

1878
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:20,631
He's a really interesting case too 
because george didn't really wrestle 

1879
01:22:20,631 --> 01:22:20,631
competitively in college or in high 
school.

1880
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:23,820
He learned wrestling from a bunch of 
russian nationals in montreal,

1881
01:22:23,850 --> 01:22:28,850
which could be good.
you lose a lot of those things that 

1882
01:22:28,850 --> 01:22:28,850
aren't needed.
Yeah.

1883
01:22:28,850 --> 01:22:31,050
Well george is also,
he's so humble,

1884
01:22:31,170 --> 01:22:35,760
like as confident as he was as a 
champion and as a dominant champion.

1885
01:22:36,150 --> 01:22:41,150
He's so humble.
Like you could teach george things and 

1886
01:22:41,150 --> 01:22:41,150
he would just completely absorbed,
but he would never,

1887
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:46,500
you know,
he wasn't the type of guy that would 

1888
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:49,640
have a hard time learning new things.
He was very open to stuff because I 

1889
01:22:49,640 --> 01:22:53,121
always follow him on social media and 
stuff and I hope that I'm actually 

1890
01:22:53,121 --> 01:22:54,690
trying to get out to tristar was talking
to for us a little bit.

1891
01:22:55,290 --> 01:23:00,290
I would love to go out there and train 
with their team and to see if you know 

1892
01:23:00,290 --> 01:23:00,290
how we can,
you know,

1893
01:23:00,290 --> 01:23:02,280
connect together.
I think that'd be an awesome connection.

1894
01:23:02,450 --> 01:23:04,530
It would be awesome.
I think he's still gonna fight.

1895
01:23:04,531 --> 01:23:06,170
I mean he still still talk to you.
What?

1896
01:23:06,171 --> 01:23:07,660
I heard that that's what I hit up for 
us.

1897
01:23:07,661 --> 01:23:08,350
We're like,
hey man,

1898
01:23:08,351 --> 01:23:10,450
like shit.
Call me in man.

1899
01:23:10,451 --> 01:23:13,920
Let me,
let me help you guys to take me in.

1900
01:23:14,170 --> 01:23:19,170
I got to do some work with gsp.
When he did that kickboxer vengeance 

1901
01:23:19,170 --> 01:23:23,041
movie and it was cool because he came in
and is like a never met george in my 

1902
01:23:23,041 --> 01:23:26,320
life at this point is like both illini.
I'm a fan of yours.

1903
01:23:26,321 --> 01:23:29,260
I watched,
I watched you fight Raymond Daniels.

1904
01:23:29,261 --> 01:23:29,880
I was like,
what?

1905
01:23:30,380 --> 01:23:31,660
And so for him,
because he's like,

1906
01:23:31,661 --> 01:23:35,620
he comes from a karate background.
So for him to say that he liked my style

1907
01:23:35,621 --> 01:23:37,470
and he was a fan of mine from my Raymond
Daniels fire,

1908
01:23:37,490 --> 01:23:38,050
I was like,
shit,

1909
01:23:38,051 --> 01:23:43,051
this is awesome.
they brought Raymond Daniels in to 

1910
01:23:43,051 --> 01:23:43,051
prepare Roy Mcdonald.

1911
01:23:43,051 --> 01:23:46,650
That's right.
Then I think even gsp went to daniel's 

1912
01:23:47,141 --> 01:23:48,590
fight.
belvoir kickboxing.

1913
01:23:48,850 --> 01:23:49,300
Yeah,
he did.

1914
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:50,110
Yeah,
he did.

1915
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:55,640
Yeah.
Well that's another good thing too that 

1916
01:23:55,640 --> 01:23:58,171
bella is holding those really high level
kickboxing bouts to Kevin Ross was over 

1917
01:23:58,171 --> 01:24:00,490
there and he's been doing well.
Guess who's now gonna fight.

1918
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:03,640
He's gonna fight him.
And I saw that I was actuallY talking to

1919
01:24:03,641 --> 01:24:04,870
their coach that I was like,
man,

1920
01:24:04,871 --> 01:24:06,580
we got to get gasoline and you,
uh,

1921
01:24:07,300 --> 01:24:09,710
he'd be good in the ufc,
but if we get them on gloria,

1922
01:24:09,711 --> 01:24:13,780
I think he needs a good platform to 
really grow and be consistent with it.

1923
01:24:13,781 --> 01:24:18,781
I think he'd be a perfect fit for glorY.
I mean as far as like a coverage and is 

1924
01:24:18,781 --> 01:24:20,710
falling.
he gets that full time attention and who

1925
01:24:20,711 --> 01:24:22,450
knows,
we'll see how good he is in mma.

1926
01:24:22,810 --> 01:24:26,770
Is he jUst a phenomenal striker trying 
to test himself in mma?

1927
01:24:26,810 --> 01:24:28,330
How was this ground skills?
I don't know.

1928
01:24:28,340 --> 01:24:30,850
I know he can wrestle.
I know he's a good wrestler,

1929
01:24:31,270 --> 01:24:34,060
but like at a professional wrestling 
level,

1930
01:24:34,061 --> 01:24:39,061
like ready to go kind of stuff.
It's hard to say because what I'm 

1931
01:24:39,061 --> 01:24:42,631
hearing is from just guys who trained 
with them and guys who trained mma with 

1932
01:24:42,631 --> 01:24:45,571
them,
they're surprised at how good his 

1933
01:24:45,571 --> 01:24:47,491
wrestling is.
Like he's just a really strong athletic 

1934
01:24:47,491 --> 01:24:50,641
guy.
Learned quick but his moitai so 

1935
01:24:50,641 --> 01:24:50,641
obviously very,
very good.

1936
01:24:50,641 --> 01:24:53,230
Very high elbows.
I see the spinning elbow telling guys in

1937
01:24:53,231 --> 01:24:55,720
line flight with him,
but he'd be perfect for glory.

1938
01:24:56,290 --> 01:24:56,890
Yeah.
Now,

1939
01:24:56,920 --> 01:25:01,920
do you,
do you follow all these other 

1940
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:01,920
organizations you followed by working?
Boxing?

1941
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:05,050
I follow it.
I follow all fighting as much as I can.

1942
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:07,790
Now when you watch,
um,

1943
01:25:07,990 --> 01:25:12,990
like say if you watch lion fight or your
watch bella tour any of these other 

1944
01:25:13,271 --> 01:25:15,760
organizations,
do you like make notes?

1945
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:16,440
Like,
oh,

1946
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:18,130
I don't like to see this guy over in 
glory.

1947
01:25:18,660 --> 01:25:23,660
I do,
I try to hit it out and I try to hit 

1948
01:25:23,660 --> 01:25:24,190
that out.
What is a glorious plans?

1949
01:25:24,191 --> 01:25:29,191
I mean,
I know you said that they have amazing 

1950
01:25:29,191 --> 01:25:29,710
and they're going to be split between,
um,

1951
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:32,700
we got some good uhm,
uhm,

1952
01:25:32,710 --> 01:25:37,710
investors in glory from China,
so we're going to actually try to get a 

1953
01:25:37,710 --> 01:25:38,140
few shows out in China.
Uh,

1954
01:25:38,141 --> 01:25:40,510
we're looking at south America,
um,

1955
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:43,630
and then the rest mixed between the us 
and europe.

1956
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:45,010
That's awesome.
Yay.

1957
01:25:45,030 --> 01:25:47,950
Team shows and this is the first time 
that glory is coming out and saying,

1958
01:25:47,951 --> 01:25:52,951
listen,
there's 18 shows in our december 

1959
01:25:52,951 --> 01:25:54,580
collision show.
We got to announce glory la.

1960
01:25:54,581 --> 01:25:56,920
We've got that.
We're going to go to chicago next.

1961
01:25:57,130 --> 01:26:00,160
so we're having that time to show 
everyone that,

1962
01:26:00,161 --> 01:26:02,380
hey man,
there's two or three shows coming up.

1963
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:04,100
Here's to prepare and plan

1964
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:06,260
because when you don't have that funding
all the time,

1965
01:26:06,261 --> 01:26:11,261
it's kind of hard to have those multiple
events and have that time to build up 

1966
01:26:11,511 --> 01:26:13,220
the shows properly.
And now that we have.

1967
01:26:13,221 --> 01:26:15,530
And I think the sports just going to go 
crazy.

1968
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:17,930
I hope so man.
I really do.

1969
01:26:17,931 --> 01:26:22,931
And I think it's awesome.
They're going to have more than one a 

1970
01:26:22,931 --> 01:26:22,931
month.
I mean,

1971
01:26:22,931 --> 01:26:22,931
that's incredible.
Yeah.

1972
01:26:22,931 --> 01:26:26,760
Yeah.
We'll need consistency one a month plus 

1973
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:26,760
six more.
That's,

1974
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:27,320
that's amazing.
I mean,

1975
01:26:27,530 --> 01:26:32,530
you know,
every other month they're going to have 

1976
01:26:32,530 --> 01:26:32,530
two events then that's what we want.
Incredible.

1977
01:26:32,530 --> 01:26:35,420
That's really good.
And like as far as coverage,

1978
01:26:35,421 --> 01:26:39,050
I know you guys are on ufc fight pass.
It's also sometimes on espn,

1979
01:26:39,790 --> 01:26:44,210
espn three and sometimes we get espn to 
live so it's all depending,

1980
01:26:44,211 --> 01:26:49,211
but I'm hoping we can get on.
That's a huge step because we started 

1981
01:26:49,211 --> 01:26:49,211
off on spike tv.

1982
01:26:49,211 --> 01:26:49,920
Um,
and then when,

1983
01:26:49,940 --> 01:26:51,490
which was great,
it was okay.

1984
01:26:51,491 --> 01:26:54,050
I was going,
well it was great for me.

1985
01:26:54,140 --> 01:26:59,140
I could watch it.
But then what was happening was when we 

1986
01:26:59,140 --> 01:26:59,680
went to espn,
it's just a whole different market now.

1987
01:26:59,810 --> 01:27:03,770
If we want to hit those casual fans,
espn is going to be the place to do it.

1988
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:04,850
Yes.
Yeah,

1989
01:27:04,851 --> 01:27:06,920
for sure.
the espn three,

1990
01:27:06,930 --> 01:27:11,930
those weird.
We need to get it when we're on live 

1991
01:27:11,930 --> 01:27:12,770
onto it seems to do well,
but we just kinda keep it,

1992
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:17,800
keep it going.
Now what are they going to do with rico 

1993
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:17,840
and butter?
Because the rico verhoeven,

1994
01:27:17,890 --> 01:27:21,420
badr hari five was probably one of the 
most most hyped up heavyweight fights of

1995
01:27:21,830 --> 01:27:23,090
13,000
people.

1996
01:27:23,150 --> 01:27:27,800
Nuts wasn't really like when badr hari 
is in the building,

1997
01:27:27,950 --> 01:27:30,240
like people know he's a superstar.
Yes.

1998
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:35,320
Like he doesn't even have to fight and 
he's a superstar and it was in a uber 

1999
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:35,810
house in Germany,
which is where borders,

2000
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:36,260
holland.

2001
01:27:36,530 --> 01:27:41,530
So all the hall fans,
a lot of the dutch moroccans came and 

2002
01:27:41,530 --> 01:27:44,801
when he came out crazy people were just 
going nuts trying to rush and get him.

2003
01:27:45,441 --> 01:27:49,880
He's a superstar sell to it needs fights
like that and it's kinda like that conor

2004
01:27:49,881 --> 01:27:54,881
mcgregor,
he builds that energy around him that 

2005
01:27:54,881 --> 01:27:55,970
people just need to tune into.
And I think that's what bothered does.

2006
01:27:55,971 --> 01:28:00,230
So that rematch is going to be crazy.
So I think rico was going to go fight.

2007
01:28:00,231 --> 01:28:02,240
He has some other fights that he has to 
fight.

2008
01:28:02,810 --> 01:28:05,360
There's contender tournaments that a 
winter.

2009
01:28:05,361 --> 01:28:10,361
He gets the fight,
like he has a fight with ishmael launch 

2010
01:28:10,361 --> 01:28:10,361
planned.
I think if you watch collision,

2011
01:28:10,361 --> 01:28:13,900
there's ben jamal sadeek who was at big 
monster heavyweight.

2012
01:28:14,150 --> 01:28:19,150
He's looking good.
You have guys like jafar wellness who 

2013
01:28:19,150 --> 01:28:19,700
are doing really well.
Benjamin addict boy,

2014
01:28:19,940 --> 01:28:24,020
so there's so many fights for ricoh and 
I think bob is going to be once he heals

2015
01:28:24,021 --> 01:28:25,970
up and then maybe they'll do another one
next year,

2016
01:28:25,971 --> 01:28:27,320
but nothing planned right now.

2017
01:28:27,620 --> 01:28:30,800
You just got to be another fight has to 
happen.

2018
01:28:30,801 --> 01:28:33,920
But I mean how long does it take before 
I can be back in action?

2019
01:28:33,921 --> 01:28:35,470
He had a broken forearm.
Is that what happened?

2020
01:28:35,480 --> 01:28:37,260
He tore a ligament,
but that's what it was.

2021
01:28:37,261 --> 01:28:38,750
I think it was a torn ligament.
Huh.

2022
01:28:38,900 --> 01:28:41,060
And it's trying to.
I've re watched it a few times trying to

2023
01:28:41,061 --> 01:28:42,710
see where in the fight had happened and 
it's,

2024
01:28:42,790 --> 01:28:44,930
it's very tough to actually see where it
happened.

2025
01:28:45,470 --> 01:28:50,240
but apparently he tore a ligament in his
form and it just wasn't working.

2026
01:28:50,241 --> 01:28:55,241
Right.
You can tell he looked down on because 

2027
01:28:55,241 --> 01:28:56,860
it didn't look like trying to find it.
There was no real time where the damage 

2028
01:28:56,860 --> 01:28:57,470
happened.
Were you seen him do it?

2029
01:28:57,910 --> 01:28:59,000
I don't know.
It's weird,

2030
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:01,980
but I think it is somewhere must've torn
and he

2031
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:05,010
just couldn't take the pain anymore.
god,

2032
01:29:05,011 --> 01:29:08,390
I was so weird,
but it was interesting because bought or

2033
01:29:08,391 --> 01:29:12,300
who's just a notorious psycho came out 
in the first round,

2034
01:29:12,301 --> 01:29:14,520
pretty controlled and measured,
you know,

2035
01:29:14,550 --> 01:29:19,550
and,
and approach the fIght intelligently to 

2036
01:29:19,550 --> 01:29:19,560
said no,
we're going to do three rounds.

2037
01:29:19,650 --> 01:29:22,500
I haven't been fighting a long time.
I don't want a five round fight.

2038
01:29:22,501 --> 01:29:25,110
I want a three round fight.
Didn't care about the title.

2039
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:27,210
Yeah,
it wasn't for the world title.

2040
01:29:27,630 --> 01:29:32,630
I think what he wanted to do was have 
this three rounder than let them meet 

2041
01:29:32,630 --> 01:29:36,831
again for the five rounds.
So if it's a torn tendon or ligament 

2042
01:29:36,831 --> 01:29:39,450
rather,
that is a much more invasive issue.

2043
01:29:39,451 --> 01:29:44,451
Right.
That's a long and I haven't really 

2044
01:29:44,451 --> 01:29:44,451
gotten an update.
I'll try to find out for us.

2045
01:29:44,451 --> 01:29:45,990
Usually ligaments take a long time to 
heal,

2046
01:29:45,991 --> 01:29:48,510
like the maybe even need surgery or 
something like that.

2047
01:29:48,510 --> 01:29:50,580
And if that's the case,
you might be out a year.

2048
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:54,630
Unfortunately,
that indeed that fight needs to happen.

2049
01:29:54,720 --> 01:29:57,510
We need to get more people.
We need to get more people on and that's

2050
01:29:57,511 --> 01:29:59,240
what got everyone hyped.
Yeah.

2051
01:29:59,340 --> 01:30:01,410
Got everyone excited about kickboxing 
again,

2052
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:03,300
potter such a personality,
you know,

2053
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:07,140
that's the kindness use of that word.
Personality ever.

2054
01:30:07,430 --> 01:30:10,290
Just going to keep them out of jail 
between now and the next fight,

2055
01:30:11,150 --> 01:30:13,680
post fIght interview.
He goes to rico and he looked at him and

2056
01:30:13,681 --> 01:30:14,400
he said,
you know what?

2057
01:30:14,640 --> 01:30:16,050
You did good,
you did good,

2058
01:30:16,110 --> 01:30:18,330
but next time and knock you the fuck 
out.

2059
01:30:18,390 --> 01:30:19,810
and everyone was like,
holy shit,

2060
01:30:19,880 --> 01:30:24,880
like already that the next fights 
already hyped up even after the loss of 

2061
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:24,880
were like,
yeah,

2062
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:26,670
this is what this sport needs.
Let's get attention.

2063
01:30:26,671 --> 01:30:29,970
And I keep trying to say,
and I came out publicly a little bit,

2064
01:30:30,020 --> 01:30:31,290
um,
a little while ago.

2065
01:30:31,470 --> 01:30:36,470
Fighters need to,
in the kickboxing world need to do more 

2066
01:30:36,470 --> 01:30:40,611
to promote themselves.
They can't constantly rely on glory or 

2067
01:30:40,611 --> 01:30:44,121
other people to kind of promote them.
They got to go oUt there and really try 

2068
01:30:44,121 --> 01:30:44,670
to build themselves.
And the more they build themselves,

2069
01:30:44,671 --> 01:30:46,860
the more the sport's going to build.
Yeah.

2070
01:30:46,910 --> 01:30:48,690
I,
I completely agree.

2071
01:30:48,691 --> 01:30:51,630
It's just so hard For fighters to figure
out how to promote themselves.

2072
01:30:51,631 --> 01:30:56,631
It's hard enough to be a great fighter.
It's hard enough to train hard and get 

2073
01:30:56,631 --> 01:30:57,640
in shape and fight smart and to,
to,

2074
01:30:57,720 --> 01:31:02,720
you know,
Concentrate on social media too and you 

2075
01:31:02,720 --> 01:31:02,720
see a lot of fails,
a lot,

2076
01:31:02,720 --> 01:31:06,610
a lot of fake,
like fake trash talking and it just 

2077
01:31:06,610 --> 01:31:07,640
comes out and clunky and terrible.
But then there's,

2078
01:31:07,750 --> 01:31:12,750
you know,
there's always these guys lIke connor 

2079
01:31:12,750 --> 01:31:12,750
that do it and you just go,
jesus,

2080
01:31:12,750 --> 01:31:12,750
he's so effortless with it,
eh?

2081
01:31:13,110 --> 01:31:14,700
But that sales sign in.
Yes.

2082
01:31:14,940 --> 01:31:16,740
But that's their personality,
you know?

2083
01:31:16,980 --> 01:31:18,940
It just happens naturally.
Yeah.

2084
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:20,540
It sure.
Everyone would love to be connor.

2085
01:31:20,550 --> 01:31:23,020
Right?
Just fun and people can.

2086
01:31:23,021 --> 01:31:23,550
Yeah.
I mean,

2087
01:31:23,551 --> 01:31:28,551
look,
he's got floyd mayweather saying that 

2088
01:31:28,551 --> 01:31:28,551
that's the only fight that he's 
interested in.

2089
01:31:28,551 --> 01:31:28,620
He,
jamie,

2090
01:31:28,630 --> 01:31:29,730
me.
what the hell's going on with that thing

2091
01:31:29,731 --> 01:31:31,780
up there?
Started doing that.

2092
01:31:31,781 --> 01:31:33,520
I think it's like resetting itself.
I can't.

2093
01:31:33,750 --> 01:31:36,780
Is it youtube?
I'm not controlling it right now.

2094
01:31:36,781 --> 01:31:39,420
I don't know whether the tv like,
oh,

2095
01:31:39,421 --> 01:31:41,340
the tv's whacking.
Oh wow.

2096
01:31:41,420 --> 01:31:42,830
TUrn it oFf and reset it.
Okay.

2097
01:31:43,050 --> 01:31:44,450
BeCause I wanted to see that,
um,

2098
01:31:44,490 --> 01:31:46,590
the other fight that you were telling me
about the highlight reel.

2099
01:31:46,770 --> 01:31:47,360
Oh,
with.

2100
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:48,570
Yes.
Yes.

2101
01:31:48,640 --> 01:31:50,010
That's a wicked one.
Yeah.

2102
01:31:50,040 --> 01:31:50,560
Just.
Yeah.

2103
01:31:50,700 --> 01:31:53,610
And it's a little clip of just me 
throwing different combinations and then

2104
01:31:53,620 --> 01:31:55,380
using that big elbow.
It's on youtube.

2105
01:31:56,040 --> 01:31:58,670
Veldt delaney versus many baghdad.
We'll,

2106
01:31:58,730 --> 01:31:59,770
we'll put that up and

2107
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:05,100
we'll talk about that too.
So right now you are a hundred percent 

2108
01:32:05,100 --> 01:32:09,751
commentating on gloria.
you're taking some time off my teaching 

2109
01:32:09,751 --> 01:32:12,100
job of your high school teaching.
So what dId your days look like?

2110
01:32:12,550 --> 01:32:17,380
Right now it's just me training again 
and I feel I want to get back into,

2111
01:32:17,730 --> 01:32:19,250
uM,
the first time I,

2112
01:32:19,251 --> 01:32:22,780
I want to try doing different things.
Like my body needs to be stretched out a

2113
01:32:22,781 --> 01:32:24,760
little bit.
The years of damaGe on my joints.

2114
01:32:24,761 --> 01:32:28,410
I want to start doing more yoga.
I'm going to try some yoga out.

2115
01:32:28,420 --> 01:32:29,470
I want to do,
um,

2116
01:32:29,650 --> 01:32:34,650
I want to create a kickboxing 
professional kickboxing program for 

2117
01:32:34,991 --> 01:32:38,740
other pros to come in and have daytIme 
training and stuff like that.

2118
01:32:39,430 --> 01:32:44,430
There's lots of things.
So this whole fight was all about 

2119
01:32:44,430 --> 01:32:47,520
different and he's good.
He's doing pretty well in the ufc I 

2120
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:47,520
think,
isn't he?

2121
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:47,740
He's not.
He's a tough guy.

2122
01:32:48,100 --> 01:32:53,100
That's such a gorgeous combination man.
That left hook to the body and the low 

2123
01:32:53,100 --> 01:32:56,401
kick that arnesto who's combinAtion?
He's another one of my all time 

2124
01:32:57,701 --> 01:32:58,480
favorite.
He's my.

2125
01:32:58,481 --> 01:33:00,760
He's my favorite.
God is so good.

2126
01:33:01,450 --> 01:33:03,070
There was one highlight that he has on 
that.

2127
01:33:03,071 --> 01:33:06,160
I literally watChed probably a million 
times.

2128
01:33:07,940 --> 01:33:09,670
Why is he,
why does he cheer and end?

2129
01:33:09,780 --> 01:33:11,780
Because he couldn't take the low kicks 
anymore.

2130
01:33:11,781 --> 01:33:14,200
So it was his way of hyping it up.
Yeah.

2131
01:33:14,201 --> 01:33:16,190
You'll see the elbow soon.
This one right here.

2132
01:33:16,220 --> 01:33:18,170
See that elbow?
Watch what happened.

2133
01:33:18,171 --> 01:33:20,150
Wow.
Gash right away.

2134
01:33:20,151 --> 01:33:21,700
Huh?
It's so slice it.

2135
01:33:21,740 --> 01:33:25,520
That's all you really through was at 
down downward elbow.

2136
01:33:26,390 --> 01:33:28,310
Wow.
That is a fucking gas.

2137
01:33:28,670 --> 01:33:30,500
Basically.
Only hit me with that shot.

2138
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:33,710
And that was in the fourth round.
Wow.

2139
01:33:34,410 --> 01:33:39,410
And we worried about the fight getting 
stopped here and I probably should have 

2140
01:33:39,410 --> 01:33:39,480
stopped it.
Really a that.

2141
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:41,000
But I mean I was.
okay.

2142
01:33:41,001 --> 01:33:46,001
And as a fighter,
you're never going to say stop the 

2143
01:33:46,001 --> 01:33:46,001
fight.
Right.

2144
01:33:46,001 --> 01:33:47,030
But probably looking back and then right
away I just come back and say,

2145
01:33:47,031 --> 01:33:48,350
you know what,
let me give you that leg.

2146
01:33:49,220 --> 01:33:51,080
was the blood going into your eyes at 
this point?

2147
01:33:51,081 --> 01:33:52,120
A little bit.
I remember it.

2148
01:33:52,121 --> 01:33:56,540
And this was in three d apparently,
that they filmed it and literally.

2149
01:33:56,630 --> 01:33:57,320
Yeah,
I dunno.

2150
01:33:57,380 --> 01:34:00,020
So I would have loved to have seen it as
a gash.

2151
01:34:00,290 --> 01:34:05,290
That's not even the big ones.
Big ones in my head that you can't even 

2152
01:34:05,290 --> 01:34:05,290
see on top.
Yeah,

2153
01:34:05,290 --> 01:34:05,600
it's just right through the hairline

2154
01:34:07,420 --> 01:34:09,440
that it's such a nasty combination,
man.

2155
01:34:11,060 --> 01:34:12,740
Yeah.
But he basically hit me with two elbows,

2156
01:34:12,741 --> 01:34:14,180
the whole fight.
That's crazy.

2157
01:34:14,510 --> 01:34:19,510
Two gases.
Every time he did well you can't even 

2158
01:34:19,510 --> 01:34:19,510
see the scar man.
You got a good plastic surgeon.

2159
01:34:19,510 --> 01:34:23,030
The back stage doctor,
that's his face.

2160
01:34:23,031 --> 01:34:24,820
When he started cUtting my starting to 
stitch,

2161
01:34:24,830 --> 01:34:26,750
it was like I was making all these faces
like,

2162
01:34:26,780 --> 01:34:31,780
oh man,
I don't want to know that a doctor was 

2163
01:34:31,780 --> 01:34:31,780
making a face like that.
What kind of fucking dog?

2164
01:34:32,180 --> 01:34:35,030
That's ridiculous.
That's crazy man.

2165
01:34:35,390 --> 01:34:38,900
So do you have any desire to compete 
again?

2166
01:34:39,320 --> 01:34:40,290
Are you sure?
Do you,

2167
01:34:40,370 --> 01:34:43,070
have you figured your path out from here
on out?

2168
01:34:43,170 --> 01:34:44,390
Gloria has been too good,
man.

2169
01:34:44,391 --> 01:34:47,420
I've been loving this commentary gig.
It's a new challenge.

2170
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:49,330
It's um,
it's new.

2171
01:34:49,340 --> 01:34:51,710
So for me,
I have a for this the first time,

2172
01:34:51,711 --> 01:34:55,520
even when I won my world title,
I work during the day as a teacher,

2173
01:34:55,910 --> 01:34:59,120
eat my lunch as I drove the gym and then
I would train at night.

2174
01:34:59,120 --> 01:35:01,280
I won a world title working a fUlltime 
job.

2175
01:35:01,350 --> 01:35:02,840
Wow.
Because it just,

2176
01:35:02,841 --> 01:35:05,400
at that point there wasn't enough.
Um,

2177
01:35:05,470 --> 01:35:06,050
I'm,
I'm,

2178
01:35:06,290 --> 01:35:11,290
I'm used to a certain type of living and
I don't want to have to fight to 

2179
01:35:11,290 --> 01:35:15,641
survive.
And my whole thing was I'm going to use 

2180
01:35:15,641 --> 01:35:15,710
fighting to build it as a platform.
So now you know,

2181
01:35:15,711 --> 01:35:20,000
because I have a university education,
I'm able to have a commentary job,

2182
01:35:20,001 --> 01:35:23,900
I'm able to run my own gym,
I'm able to have other things going on.

2183
01:35:23,901 --> 01:35:28,901
So I was very lucky to build a good 
platform that I didn't have to rely on 

2184
01:35:28,901 --> 01:35:32,000
fighting for my income.
So right now things are too good,

2185
01:35:32,001 --> 01:35:35,390
there's more money on the sitting in a 
suit and you know,

2186
01:35:35,660 --> 01:35:39,290
trying to be joe rogan.
So I mean it's more money,

2187
01:35:39,380 --> 01:35:43,540
it's better on my health and so enjoying
and loving it,

2188
01:35:43,950 --> 01:35:44,990
genuinely loving it.

2189
01:35:45,200 --> 01:35:48,200
What was your education in health and 
physical education?

2190
01:35:48,590 --> 01:35:53,590
That's interesting.
So when you look at a training methods 

2191
01:35:53,590 --> 01:35:55,280
like some of the methods that are being 
employed today,

2192
01:35:55,281 --> 01:35:57,350
some of the varIous strength and 
conditioning methods,

2193
01:35:57,680 --> 01:35:58,840
what do you,
uh,

2194
01:35:58,950 --> 01:36:02,000
is there anything that you think that 
really stands out?

2195
01:36:02,210 --> 01:36:07,210
Well,
the main thing for me is guys in combat 

2196
01:36:07,210 --> 01:36:09,470
sports are using crossfit as a form of 
weight training for fighting.

2197
01:36:09,920 --> 01:36:14,920
I don't necessarily agree with that 
based on many tHings because they're 

2198
01:36:14,920 --> 01:36:17,600
doing an uh,
an unsafe exercise like a dead lift or a

2199
01:36:17,601 --> 01:36:22,601
clean and you're doing it over time 
where those movements are made to 

2200
01:36:22,601 --> 01:36:23,600
develop power,
hip strength,

2201
01:36:23,601 --> 01:36:26,630
you know,
they're not meant for endurance.

2202
01:36:27,080 --> 01:36:29,720
Um,
so a lot of guys are hurting themselves.

2203
01:36:29,721 --> 01:36:34,721
Like I'm seeing.
I saw some crossfit guys and they're 

2204
01:36:34,721 --> 01:36:37,370
doing this terrible rounded back dead 
lifts and they're just trying to get the

2205
01:36:37,371 --> 01:36:39,290
bar up and wait and they're hurting 
themselves.

2206
01:36:39,290 --> 01:36:41,060
They're doing too much.
Uh,

2207
01:36:41,061 --> 01:36:42,920
but uh,
sports specific,

2208
01:36:43,190 --> 01:36:46,220
properly tailored strength program is 
very important,

2209
01:36:46,520 --> 01:36:49,250
but crossfitting is just killing guys 
their body.

2210
01:36:49,251 --> 01:36:53,630
The damage on the joints,
it wasn't made to be help you enhance.

2211
01:36:53,631 --> 01:36:56,960
There's different ways to do it in a 
safer way that helps protect your body.

2212
01:36:57,260 --> 01:37:00,530
Too many people are canceling flights 
with injuries.

2213
01:37:01,060 --> 01:37:03,440
I think they overtrain they're doing 
things that,

2214
01:37:03,880 --> 01:37:08,880
you know,
things like crossfit where they're 

2215
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:10,511
constantly killing their bodies.
It's interesting because some people 

2216
01:37:10,511 --> 01:37:10,511
think that,
you know,

2217
01:37:10,511 --> 01:37:12,670
fighters or overtraining and some people
think no,

2218
01:37:12,680 --> 01:37:17,680
the problem is they just haven't built 
themselves up to the point where they 

2219
01:37:17,680 --> 01:37:19,130
can do this the way they move or 
training.

2220
01:37:19,140 --> 01:37:21,740
Then you thInk it's overture 
overtraining now.

2221
01:37:21,741 --> 01:37:24,260
When you were fighting,
what did you do?

2222
01:37:24,261 --> 01:37:26,360
Any kind of strength and conditioning?
I was huge on.

2223
01:37:26,380 --> 01:37:27,800
It was very big on it.

2224
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:29,510
I was very.
It's very,

2225
01:37:29,550 --> 01:37:30,950
it's,
it's very complex.

2226
01:37:30,951 --> 01:37:33,160
It's very difficult to explain,
but in in,

2227
01:37:33,460 --> 01:37:35,180
in a,
in a short term,

2228
01:37:35,870 --> 01:37:38,480
it's like you have to.
It's a periodization,

2229
01:37:38,780 --> 01:37:43,780
so right after my fight I would go into 
a hypertrophy phase where I tried to 

2230
01:37:43,780 --> 01:37:46,100
build myself because during your camp 
you're losing weight,

2231
01:37:46,101 --> 01:37:48,680
you're trying to break down muscle 
because you're constantly training,

2232
01:37:48,681 --> 01:37:53,681
you're not eating as much.
So I would go through a hypertrophy 

2233
01:37:53,681 --> 01:37:56,621
phase,
which is building get biggest strong as 

2234
01:37:56,621 --> 01:37:56,621
I possibly can,
closer to fight time.

2235
01:37:57,240 --> 01:38:00,600
I build that muscle into more explosive 
power.

2236
01:38:00,601 --> 01:38:04,080
So that's when I start doing.
Instead of high volume reps,

2237
01:38:04,081 --> 01:38:05,980
I'm starting to kind of lower my rep 
count.

2238
01:38:05,981 --> 01:38:08,640
I'll do five sets of five on squat,
I'm,

2239
01:38:08,641 --> 01:38:12,870
I'll do dead lifts to five.
And it's now translating that muscle and

2240
01:38:12,871 --> 01:38:15,090
that size into power.
From there,

2241
01:38:15,091 --> 01:38:18,330
you got to get the power phase turns 
into more of an explosive phase.

2242
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:21,480
So I start turning that power into that 
explosive.

2243
01:38:21,500 --> 01:38:24,600
So I'll start doing med ball throws,
explosive jumping,

2244
01:38:24,990 --> 01:38:25,580
um,
I'll,

2245
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:28,020
I'll box squat instead of a regular 
squat.

2246
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:33,320
And even when your in that hypertrophy 
phase and when you're building muscle,

2247
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:36,900
the whole point is to break your body 
down so you're sore.

2248
01:38:37,230 --> 01:38:39,660
Everyone knows how sore and how shitty 
they feel.

2249
01:38:39,720 --> 01:38:44,720
Twenty four to 48 hours after a workout 
and that's good because your body's 

2250
01:38:44,720 --> 01:38:46,830
breaking down and has to get stronger.
But when you have,

2251
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:49,980
when your goal is to fight and be good 
at your sport,

2252
01:38:50,370 --> 01:38:53,580
you can have that soreness because it's 
going to take away from your training.

2253
01:38:53,790 --> 01:38:58,790
So that's why we really have to period 
eyes our training to make sure we can 

2254
01:38:58,790 --> 01:39:02,511
peek on fight night.
There's a lot of talk in an amazing 

2255
01:39:02,511 --> 01:39:06,861
circles.
That strength and conditioning is the 

2256
01:39:06,861 --> 01:39:06,861
most important thing that once you're in
camp,

2257
01:39:06,861 --> 01:39:07,680
that's what you should concentrate on,
is your cardio,

2258
01:39:07,681 --> 01:39:10,770
your endurance,
and that your fight skills actually come

2259
01:39:10,771 --> 01:39:12,900
in secondary because you already know 
how to fight.

2260
01:39:13,230 --> 01:39:18,230
There's some people that believe that 
what you need to do is work on your 

2261
01:39:18,230 --> 01:39:20,760
fight skills and all the other time,
not that you abandoned them,

2262
01:39:20,970 --> 01:39:25,970
but that they take second place and that
the most important thing is having a 

2263
01:39:25,970 --> 01:39:25,970
phenomenal gas tank.

2264
01:39:27,800 --> 01:39:29,700
I don't know aboUt that.
I think fighting,

2265
01:39:30,120 --> 01:39:32,700
you have to constantly are fighting,
so you have to fight.

2266
01:39:32,701 --> 01:39:34,860
You have to practice what you're doing.
Do you think they'll.

2267
01:39:34,920 --> 01:39:36,960
I think the most important is your mind 
to mind.

2268
01:39:37,020 --> 01:39:38,820
The mind is number one,
did you.

2269
01:39:39,150 --> 01:39:41,760
Did you involve yourself in any sort of 
mental training?

2270
01:39:41,761 --> 01:39:42,590
Do you?
I just.

2271
01:39:42,591 --> 01:39:47,591
I was naturally gifted with it.
I was naturally had the ability to be 

2272
01:39:47,591 --> 01:39:51,891
able to block things out.
It could have been my years of sports 

2273
01:39:51,891 --> 01:39:52,410
background,
but men come fight time.

2274
01:39:52,411 --> 01:39:54,660
I barely even thought of the fight.
People are like,

2275
01:39:54,661 --> 01:39:54,980
oh,
you're,

2276
01:39:55,080 --> 01:39:57,620
you're going to Japan next week to fight
two fights in one night.

2277
01:39:57,621 --> 01:39:58,050
I like,
yeah,

2278
01:39:58,051 --> 01:40:03,051
okay.
I'll deal with it when I have to get 

2279
01:40:03,051 --> 01:40:03,051
there kind of thing.
I put my work in.

2280
01:40:03,051 --> 01:40:05,670
The more you stress about it,
the more you released the cortisone,

2281
01:40:05,671 --> 01:40:08,670
more that your body breaks itself down,
the more stressed you get,

2282
01:40:09,030 --> 01:40:10,500
the less sleep you are going to have.

2283
01:40:10,710 --> 01:40:13,320
All terrible shit when you're fighting 
in a few days.

2284
01:40:13,321 --> 01:40:18,321
Right?
So my whole strategy was just to say I 

2285
01:40:18,321 --> 01:40:22,011
do my work and the problem with you said
about overtraining and guys fight.

2286
01:40:22,890 --> 01:40:24,900
Then they party.
They eat like shit.

2287
01:40:24,901 --> 01:40:28,800
They constantly don't focus on fighting 
the k you're fighting in eight weeks.

2288
01:40:28,980 --> 01:40:29,970
Then they go,
oh shit,

2289
01:40:29,971 --> 01:40:31,980
I got to do a crash course and get up to
shape.

2290
01:40:31,981 --> 01:40:35,760
And then they overtake.
A true martial artist is it doesn't look

2291
01:40:35,761 --> 01:40:39,030
at the fight.
I'm on a flight basis.

2292
01:40:39,060 --> 01:40:41,940
It looks as a longevity.
I'm looking at,

2293
01:40:41,941 --> 01:40:43,380
okay,
for this fight,

2294
01:40:43,381 --> 01:40:45,210
yeah,
my boxing might improve a little bit,

2295
01:40:45,211 --> 01:40:50,211
but I have to improve something else.
And there's constantly improvements in 

2296
01:40:50,211 --> 01:40:50,970
all areas.
So yukon,

2297
01:40:51,030 --> 01:40:52,500
as soon as you're done your fight.
YeAh,

2298
01:40:52,501 --> 01:40:57,501
it's healthy to take a week or two off.
Some guys three weeks depending on the 

2299
01:40:57,501 --> 01:40:58,600
damage you had,
but you got to get working again.

2300
01:40:58,690 --> 01:41:00,850
You got to get back to sharpening your 
tools,

2301
01:41:00,851 --> 01:41:02,530
your weapons,
your mind.

2302
01:41:02,531 --> 01:41:04,990
You got to get back into it and 
constantly trying to.

2303
01:41:04,991 --> 01:41:09,991
You got to learn 24 slash seven.
I don't agree with guys who think they 

2304
01:41:09,991 --> 01:41:12,980
can just train for camps.
Camps on a real fighter,

2305
01:41:12,981 --> 01:41:17,981
a real athlete,
a real martial artist is going to train 

2306
01:41:17,981 --> 01:41:20,700
all year round.
You have to look at it also in terms of 

2307
01:41:20,700 --> 01:41:25,050
you're involved in one of the most 
dangerous pursuits athletically than 

2308
01:41:25,050 --> 01:41:29,101
someone can engage in and anytime that 
you're getting better is going to take 

2309
01:41:29,101 --> 01:41:32,500
away some damage that you could possibly
sustain.

2310
01:41:32,730 --> 01:41:35,140
It's going to make you better at 
aDministering damage.

2311
01:41:35,141 --> 01:41:37,630
It's going to make you better.
It's just a matter of staying the course

2312
01:41:37,631 --> 01:41:42,610
anD being disciplined to work it and I 
mean intensity changes.

2313
01:41:42,611 --> 01:41:44,410
You're not going to be right after your 
fight.

2314
01:41:44,411 --> 01:41:46,930
You're not going to bE training at that 
heart intensity that you are,

2315
01:41:47,390 --> 01:41:52,390
that you were before the fight,
but it's still important to constantly 

2316
01:41:52,390 --> 01:41:52,390
training and constantly improve.

2317
01:41:52,390 --> 01:41:54,910
Now when you say that you were kind of 
naturally good at it,

2318
01:41:54,911 --> 01:41:59,911
mentally,
no one coached you into how to relax 

2319
01:41:59,911 --> 01:42:00,820
about you just kind of instinctively 
knew that work.

2320
01:42:01,090 --> 01:42:04,090
I knew I had to do it.
I knew I had to do it.

2321
01:42:04,091 --> 01:42:09,091
Like for me especially,
I wasn't fighting guys with my level of 

2322
01:42:09,091 --> 01:42:09,670
experience.
Like you're like,

2323
01:42:09,671 --> 01:42:11,830
hey,
my first fight with glory,

2324
01:42:11,831 --> 01:42:16,130
I fought a legend in the sport.
Morat derechos and they will.

2325
01:42:16,410 --> 01:42:19,420
Glory signed me right after that fight.
We watched with many baghdad.

2326
01:42:19,630 --> 01:42:23,050
I got an email from a random guy at this
point and now friends with them,

2327
01:42:23,350 --> 01:42:24,040
but it's like,
hey,

2328
01:42:24,041 --> 01:42:27,370
I can get you find some bullshit.
Everybody can get me fights,

2329
01:42:27,371 --> 01:42:28,300
and then I sent them like,
yeah,

2330
01:42:28,301 --> 01:42:29,980
here's my manager.
Go off,

2331
01:42:30,160 --> 01:42:31,000
and then they're like,
hey,

2332
01:42:31,500 --> 01:42:32,890
yeah,
we want to sign you to glory.

2333
01:42:32,891 --> 01:42:34,870
Just like a few hours before that many 
bag,

2334
01:42:34,871 --> 01:42:35,320
that fight.

2335
01:42:35,320 --> 01:42:35,780
I was like,
ah,

2336
01:42:35,800 --> 01:42:37,210
wicked,
because this was what I wanted.

2337
01:42:37,211 --> 01:42:38,620
right.
My dreAms here.

2338
01:42:38,980 --> 01:42:39,460
So like,
oh,

2339
01:42:39,461 --> 01:42:42,070
your first fight is against morat 
directly and Turkey.

2340
01:42:42,110 --> 01:42:43,170
I was like,
okay.

2341
01:42:43,270 --> 01:42:46,570
I never really the same morat direct you
that I think it is.

2342
01:42:46,571 --> 01:42:48,310
So I looked it up with.
It's the same guy.

2343
01:42:48,311 --> 01:42:53,311
He had like 90 flights.
It was my seventh in his hometown,

2344
01:42:54,300 --> 01:42:59,300
you know,
I'm going to press conferences with 

2345
01:42:59,300 --> 01:42:59,300
goal,
can saki,

2346
01:42:59,300 --> 01:42:59,300
daniel guida,
and I'm sitting there and I'm like,

2347
01:42:59,300 --> 01:43:04,291
I have six professional fights and all 
the turkish cameras are all around us 

2348
01:43:04,291 --> 01:43:07,630
and I didn't know what was going on,
but I was confident in myself.

2349
01:43:07,631 --> 01:43:11,200
I believed in myself.
I knew I had the skill to do it.

2350
01:43:11,201 --> 01:43:13,300
I looked at my coach and we can I beat 
this guy and yeah,

2351
01:43:13,540 --> 01:43:14,450
you'll kill him.
Was like,

2352
01:43:14,600 --> 01:43:15,310
cool,
let's do it.

2353
01:43:15,730 --> 01:43:20,730
And then at that point I just had that 
much confidence and belief in myself 

2354
01:43:20,730 --> 01:43:22,300
that nothing mattered.
Now when you,

2355
01:43:22,360 --> 01:43:27,360
when you go into a fight like that and 
you approach a fight like that and 

2356
01:43:27,360 --> 01:43:29,120
you're saying that these guys had so 
much more experience than you,

2357
01:43:29,121 --> 01:43:33,130
so you had to almost approach the fight 
as a more experienced fighter.

2358
01:43:33,400 --> 01:43:35,170
Yeah.
And I did you.

2359
01:43:35,230 --> 01:43:39,370
My whole thing was I knew what I was 
really good at and I couldn't.

2360
01:43:39,400 --> 01:43:44,400
With someone with a hundred fights,
you're so comfortable in there and if I 

2361
01:43:44,400 --> 01:43:44,800
play that relaxed fighting game with 
them,

2362
01:43:44,830 --> 01:43:49,830
it's not a good luck.
There are better at picking their shots 

2363
01:43:49,830 --> 01:43:49,830
probably.
I'd still probably beat that.

2364
01:43:49,830 --> 01:43:52,670
I'm not going to say that,
but before the fight I'm go,

2365
01:43:52,690 --> 01:43:54,590
I'm,
I'm going to make them fight my fight.

2366
01:43:54,591 --> 01:43:59,591
If I fight their fight,
there's a good chance they're going to 

2367
01:43:59,591 --> 01:43:59,591
beat me.

2368
01:43:59,591 --> 01:44:01,520
So I went in and basically you have to 
fight this fight in order to beat me.

2369
01:44:01,521 --> 01:44:06,521
And this was my strength that was 
stronger than most of the guys that 

2370
01:44:06,521 --> 01:44:06,590
fought because that's a good strength 
and conditioning program.

2371
01:44:06,850 --> 01:44:07,370
My,
uh,

2372
01:44:07,410 --> 01:44:09,470
actually who's outside cost,
the client analyst,

2373
01:44:09,471 --> 01:44:13,070
he was a strength and conditioning coach
for the toronto maple leafs in Canada.

2374
01:44:13,460 --> 01:44:15,680
So he knew a lot.
He was amazing.

2375
01:44:15,681 --> 01:44:19,040
So I was the strongest guy that I've 
ever.

2376
01:44:19,730 --> 01:44:22,160
I haven't seen anyone who's really 
stronger than me in the ring.

2377
01:44:22,220 --> 01:44:24,110
So I went in there and I fought my 
fight.

2378
01:44:24,350 --> 01:44:26,060
Good coaching,
paul minaz,

2379
01:44:26,090 --> 01:44:28,340
good coaching.
So everything was just on point for me.

2380
01:44:28,640 --> 01:44:30,770
Now,
do you do any visualization?

2381
01:44:30,771 --> 01:44:32,630
Did you do any,
any sort of meditation?

2382
01:44:32,631 --> 01:44:37,631
Truly nothing planned.
We'd just be driving my car and I'm 

2383
01:44:37,631 --> 01:44:41,051
thinking about how it feels to win and 
how I'm going to win and it just 

2384
01:44:41,051 --> 01:44:43,670
happened naturally and then I kind of 
blocked it off where I didn't even think

2385
01:44:43,671 --> 01:44:44,030
about it.

2386
01:44:44,030 --> 01:44:49,030
The last thing you want to do is go to 
your bed at night and think about a 

2387
01:44:49,030 --> 01:44:49,030
fight.
It's terrible,

2388
01:44:49,030 --> 01:44:49,490
isn't it?
You're like,

2389
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:50,960
oh shit,
what if I get knocked out?

2390
01:44:51,050 --> 01:44:56,050
Oh man,
everyone's watching me who's watching 

2391
01:44:56,050 --> 01:44:56,050
this?
And again,

2392
01:44:56,050 --> 01:44:59,060
it gets scary.
So you got to learn to be able to block 

2393
01:44:59,060 --> 01:44:59,540
it off.
And I think that's where my teaching job

2394
01:44:59,541 --> 01:45:02,180
helped a little bit because when I was 
in my teaching job,

2395
01:45:02,181 --> 01:45:04,020
I really didn't think of the fight.
I was like,

2396
01:45:04,021 --> 01:45:05,480
oh,
I'll deal with it after.

2397
01:45:05,930 --> 01:45:08,300
Because it's fighting is a lot of 
stress.

2398
01:45:08,301 --> 01:45:13,301
A lot of guys can handle it and there's 
a lot of guys you see on pads that are 

2399
01:45:13,301 --> 01:45:14,270
incredible.
These guys could whip pads,

2400
01:45:14,271 --> 01:45:19,271
kicks punches.
One of the most beautiful display of 

2401
01:45:19,271 --> 01:45:19,271
technique on pads,
you put them in the ring,

2402
01:45:19,970 --> 01:45:21,200
they just don't have it mentally.

2403
01:45:21,470 --> 01:45:23,300
Too much anxiety,
too much stress.

2404
01:45:23,540 --> 01:45:28,540
They just can't handle that pressure,
so that's one of the biggest parts is 

2405
01:45:28,540 --> 01:45:29,990
having that confidence in yourself in 
that mindset.

2406
01:45:30,380 --> 01:45:35,380
I wanted to go back to a war we're 
talking about with strength and 

2407
01:45:35,380 --> 01:45:37,931
conditioning or like I said,
there's a philosophy that many are 

2408
01:45:37,931 --> 01:45:41,771
taking an mma that the strength 
conditioning is more important during 

2409
01:45:41,771 --> 01:45:42,230
fight camp than actual fight training 
itself.

2410
01:45:42,620 --> 01:45:47,620
This is about mma though.
Do you think that maybe the physical 

2411
01:45:47,620 --> 01:45:50,201
requirements of fighting five minute 
rounds and you know a lot of the 

2412
01:45:50,201 --> 01:45:53,501
grappling and clenching,
which is just unbelievably grueling on 

2413
01:45:53,501 --> 01:45:56,411
your body.
Do you think that that's that there's 

2414
01:45:56,411 --> 01:45:56,720
different physical requirements and that
sport mayBe then kickboxing?

2415
01:45:56,810 --> 01:45:58,280
I think it's just different,
right?

2416
01:45:58,610 --> 01:46:01,250
It's just different.
you need that different.

2417
01:46:01,251 --> 01:46:04,250
If I were to to roll one minute in 
jujitsu,

2418
01:46:04,251 --> 01:46:09,251
I probably be gassed out like I wrestled
around sometimes just as a joke and and 

2419
01:46:09,251 --> 01:46:09,290
stuff.

2420
01:46:09,300 --> 01:46:10,550
I actually,
the father of my niece,

2421
01:46:10,551 --> 01:46:14,050
nephew is one of the pioneers in Canada,
have a brazilian jujitsu,

2422
01:46:14,060 --> 01:46:15,050
I don't know,
richard,

2423
01:46:15,051 --> 01:46:20,051
monkey nana,
and he's just been around it my whole 

2424
01:46:20,051 --> 01:46:20,570
life and my role for one minute I'm 
gassed,

2425
01:46:20,930 --> 01:46:21,920
you know,
I can't do it,

2426
01:46:21,921 --> 01:46:24,350
but if I,
if they kick box with me for one minute,

2427
01:46:24,650 --> 01:46:26,210
they can't handle it either.
Right.

2428
01:46:26,420 --> 01:46:31,420
So it's just what you prepare for.
If you're that marathon runner and you 

2429
01:46:31,420 --> 01:46:34,211
try to swim five lanes in the pool,
you're done totally different energy 

2430
01:46:34,211 --> 01:46:38,291
systems.
But I have to say mma is different 

2431
01:46:38,291 --> 01:46:42,791
demands on the body.
It's a totally different demand on the 

2432
01:46:42,791 --> 01:46:46,331
body.
You need to be able to wrestle and then 

2433
01:46:46,331 --> 01:46:48,500
stand up and be explosive,
which is really difficult to do.

2434
01:46:49,110 --> 01:46:49,680
Do you

2435
01:46:50,550 --> 01:46:54,750
foresee yourself getting involved Any 
more deeply and mma fighters?

2436
01:46:55,560 --> 01:46:57,390
I would love to.
I just waiting for a guy.

2437
01:46:57,600 --> 01:46:59,490
I'm not that guy that's going to really 
go out there.

2438
01:46:59,491 --> 01:47:01,670
And thiS is george st pierre obviously,
but uh,

2439
01:47:02,160 --> 01:47:04,350
I'm hoping to one day obviously have a 
build,

2440
01:47:04,351 --> 01:47:07,590
a good group of guys who were fighting 
in the ufc.

2441
01:47:07,920 --> 01:47:09,920
So what would love to have that,
that's the,

2442
01:47:09,950 --> 01:47:14,950
the ultimate goal is to be able to 
impart your knowledge on some webinars 

2443
01:47:14,950 --> 01:47:17,310
coming up for sure.
And especially at the gym now.

2444
01:47:17,311 --> 01:47:22,311
I've been loving it and loving it and it
seemed a lot of those ufc guys now or 

2445
01:47:22,311 --> 01:47:26,090
hopefully seeing all these videos and 
these drills that I'm posting and what 

2446
01:47:26,090 --> 01:47:27,440
it can have to offer and if you could.
There's so many times I watched the ufc,

2447
01:47:27,490 --> 01:47:32,490
like if this guy had a little bit of,
you know me coaching him and I'm sure 

2448
01:47:32,490 --> 01:47:36,081
they have great coaches but you know,
they just need that little extra.

2449
01:47:36,450 --> 01:47:41,450
I know what you're saying and I think 
this is also such a cool time for 

2450
01:47:41,450 --> 01:47:44,841
fighters to be able to hear these words 
from guys like you and to be able to 

2451
01:47:44,841 --> 01:47:48,620
easily access those videos that you're 
putting up and all these striking 

2452
01:47:48,620 --> 01:47:52,401
breakdowns that guys like lawrence 
kenshin are putting up and all these 

2453
01:47:52,401 --> 01:47:55,071
other people.
I mean it's an amazing time and as far 

2454
01:47:55,071 --> 01:47:57,960
as like the amount of information that 
you can get for fighters and people have

2455
01:47:57,961 --> 01:47:59,000
to use it.
Yeah.

2456
01:47:59,220 --> 01:48:00,930
And it's a lot of pride too,
right?

2457
01:48:00,950 --> 01:48:02,250
It's,
it's tough sometimes,

2458
01:48:02,251 --> 01:48:07,251
like even with a lot of the fighters 
that I approached and I give tips to 

2459
01:48:07,251 --> 01:48:08,340
when you're at a higher level,
you think you know everything.

2460
01:48:08,341 --> 01:48:12,330
And that's kind of like you said,
george was very humble that way where he

2461
01:48:12,331 --> 01:48:15,810
can kind of allow and accept knowledge.
I think that's important.

2462
01:48:15,810 --> 01:48:18,000
A lot of guys can't.
They think they're just,

2463
01:48:18,001 --> 01:48:20,190
they know and everything.
And that's terrible mindset.

2464
01:48:20,490 --> 01:48:25,490
I think you're totally right.
And I think that there's no way like 

2465
01:48:25,490 --> 01:48:28,530
what you were saying about if you want 
to be a very good mma fighter,

2466
01:48:28,531 --> 01:48:30,240
there's no way you're going to be the 
best at everything.

2467
01:48:30,270 --> 01:48:34,380
It's impossible.
So when you got a guy like george,

2468
01:48:34,960 --> 01:48:35,680
uh,
you know,

2469
01:48:35,760 --> 01:48:40,760
one of the beautiful things about him 
was that he was aware of where his 

2470
01:48:40,760 --> 01:48:42,000
limitations lie.
He was aware of where his strengths were

2471
01:48:42,001 --> 01:48:44,190
and he,
he knew how to put it all together.

2472
01:48:44,460 --> 01:48:48,690
I always talk about fighting as if like,
it's a language because I think that,

2473
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:51,540
you know,
a lot of people know how to use words.

2474
01:48:51,541 --> 01:48:56,541
A lot of people know what the words are,
but can you string them together 

2475
01:48:56,541 --> 01:48:59,271
eloquently and that's one of the things 
that I see like when I'm watching that 

2476
01:48:59,271 --> 01:49:02,751
fight with many baghdad,
when you throw in that combination left 

2477
01:49:02,751 --> 01:49:06,141
hook to the body low kick,
it's like it's a beautiful flowing 

2478
01:49:06,141 --> 01:49:06,750
sentence and a lot of ways you're 
expressing yourself in that.

2479
01:49:07,280 --> 01:49:10,410
A good way of putting it,
because I was talking to someone,

2480
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:13,800
I think it was matt embry today.
I did fight or interviews before I came,

2481
01:49:14,250 --> 01:49:16,830
so a lot of their things they were 
saying are fresh in my mind,

2482
01:49:16,831 --> 01:49:19,560
but he was saying it's like it's human 
nature.

2483
01:49:19,561 --> 01:49:24,561
Everyone knows what fighting is.
You can really watch two guys and now 

2484
01:49:24,561 --> 01:49:26,610
you can say who's winning?
Who did more damage.

2485
01:49:26,611 --> 01:49:29,700
You can see it.
So it's like looking at the words on the

2486
01:49:29,701 --> 01:49:31,740
page,
but once you know how to read,

2487
01:49:31,741 --> 01:49:35,160
it becomes a totally different game.
it's not just words on a page anymore.

2488
01:49:35,660 --> 01:49:37,530
Yeah,
it's good way of putting it.

2489
01:49:37,560 --> 01:49:38,920
Yeah.
It's um,

2490
01:49:40,140 --> 01:49:42,360
it's a beautiful thing man.
It really is.

2491
01:49:42,390 --> 01:49:44,490
Fighting is like nothing else.
I mean,

2492
01:49:44,491 --> 01:49:49,150
it's so heartbreaking when you,
someone get devastated and smash like bj

2493
01:49:49,151 --> 01:49:52,390
penn did against the air rodriguez,
but on the other hand,

2494
01:49:52,391 --> 01:49:56,470
so beautiful when you see what your year
was able to do to a legend like bj penn.

2495
01:49:56,500 --> 01:49:59,380
I mean,
it's such a fighting and all forms,

2496
01:49:59,381 --> 01:50:01,690
whether it's boxing,
like thai kickboxing,

2497
01:50:01,691 --> 01:50:06,691
mma.
It's to me one of the most engaging 

2498
01:50:06,691 --> 01:50:11,491
things for someone to watch.
Would you want to fight in the ufc if 

2499
01:50:11,491 --> 01:50:11,491
you could?
No,

2500
01:50:11,491 --> 01:50:12,290
no.
First of all,

2501
01:50:12,291 --> 01:50:13,210
I'm oldest.
Fuck.

2502
01:50:13,360 --> 01:50:18,360
But in your prime,
if I was competing still when the ufc 

2503
01:50:18,360 --> 01:50:20,920
was around,
I probably would've done something.

2504
01:50:20,921 --> 01:50:25,921
But also when the ufc first came around,
it was like one weight class and you 

2505
01:50:25,921 --> 01:50:28,420
know,
when I stopped fighting was in 1989.

2506
01:50:28,421 --> 01:50:31,780
That was the last kickboxing fight that 
I had and that was um,

2507
01:50:31,840 --> 01:50:35,800
there was nothing and there was no money
in it and I was getting headaches too,

2508
01:50:35,801 --> 01:50:38,320
just from sparring.
And I did not spar smart.

2509
01:50:38,380 --> 01:50:40,920
I sparred meathead style and you know,
I just,

2510
01:50:41,230 --> 01:50:45,550
I know a lot more today than I ever did 
them as far as consequences.

2511
01:50:45,550 --> 01:50:48,040
And what's important and how to learn 
better,

2512
01:50:48,220 --> 01:50:50,980
you know,
which I think is how knowing how to be.

2513
01:50:51,100 --> 01:50:56,100
I was good at being obsessed with things
and really like just just focusing on 

2514
01:50:56,111 --> 01:50:58,990
them constantly all the time.
But it was more frantic and frenetic.

2515
01:50:59,350 --> 01:51:01,900
It wasn't like calculated and 
intelligent.

2516
01:51:02,460 --> 01:51:07,460
It's like crashing in and learn and just
being obsessed is constantly training 

2517
01:51:07,460 --> 01:51:08,230
all day,
all the day.

2518
01:51:08,500 --> 01:51:10,360
But I think that,
you know,

2519
01:51:10,420 --> 01:51:15,420
one of the things that we're knowing 
we're learning now is the right way to 

2520
01:51:15,420 --> 01:51:20,281
learn.
Like you were saying that so many 

2521
01:51:20,281 --> 01:51:20,281
fighters are overtrained,
you know,

2522
01:51:20,281 --> 01:51:24,090
and uh,
that so many fighters to spar too hard 

2523
01:51:24,090 --> 01:51:24,090
and they,
you know,

2524
01:51:24,090 --> 01:51:27,930
a lot of like what you're saying,
people think that hitting the pads and 

2525
01:51:27,930 --> 01:51:30,841
getting tired as good work.
It's tough though because when you have 

2526
01:51:30,841 --> 01:51:32,590
a fighter's mentality,
you gotta think it's easy to be outside.

2527
01:51:32,590 --> 01:51:34,180
And I could say it because I've been in 
it,

2528
01:51:34,181 --> 01:51:35,950
but when someone on the outside says,
oh,

2529
01:51:35,951 --> 01:51:37,160
these guys,
you know,

2530
01:51:37,180 --> 01:51:42,180
they need to train harder.
They need to keep doing more and more 

2531
01:51:42,180 --> 01:51:42,180
and more.
And when you fight and you're like,

2532
01:51:42,180 --> 01:51:43,300
shit,
I kind of fight in three weeks.

2533
01:51:43,301 --> 01:51:45,220
you never think your conditioning is 
good enough.

2534
01:51:45,640 --> 01:51:47,560
You could train everyday,
all day,

2535
01:51:47,561 --> 01:51:52,561
put your best effort and you never going
to think you're conditioning is good 

2536
01:51:52,561 --> 01:51:55,621
enough.
You're going to be like the day before 

2537
01:51:55,621 --> 01:51:57,721
the fight,
you've done everything possible in your 

2538
01:51:57,721 --> 01:51:59,551
training.
You're going to go on and you're going 

2539
01:51:59,551 --> 01:52:01,051
to second guess your conditioning.
You're going to wonder if you did it 

2540
01:52:01,051 --> 01:52:01,051
enough.
You're going to wonder,

2541
01:52:01,051 --> 01:52:01,270
shit,
I should have trained now.

2542
01:52:01,420 --> 01:52:02,950
Why didn't I?
My sunday rest?

2543
01:52:02,951 --> 01:52:04,780
That should have been training.
I shouldn't be getting better.

2544
01:52:05,080 --> 01:52:08,320
But really you have to get in that 
Mindset that you know,

2545
01:52:08,410 --> 01:52:10,360
you don't need More All the time.

2546
01:52:10,360 --> 01:52:13,000
And that's why guys are getting injured.
They're putting their bodies,

2547
01:52:13,001 --> 01:52:15,430
they're not letting themselves rest and 
they're getting sick.

2548
01:52:15,670 --> 01:52:16,680
I bet you if you go on,
uh,

2549
01:52:16,681 --> 01:52:18,160
in,
in one of your ufc shows,

2550
01:52:18,161 --> 01:52:21,340
and you ask every fighter on that card 
who's sick,

2551
01:52:21,790 --> 01:52:26,790
I bet you 50 percent would be sick with 
some sort of cold or infection or a 

2552
01:52:26,790 --> 01:52:31,371
sinus infection.
Most of those guys are probably sick 

2553
01:52:31,371 --> 01:52:33,400
because their immune system is crashed 
from not eating constantly.

2554
01:52:33,401 --> 01:52:38,401
Training stress,
not sleeping like I bet you more than 

2555
01:52:38,401 --> 01:52:39,910
half are sick with something.
Absolutely.

2556
01:52:39,970 --> 01:52:44,970
I'm sure.
I was always sick before taekwondo 

2557
01:52:44,970 --> 01:52:44,970
tournaments and sinuses.
For me,

2558
01:52:44,970 --> 01:52:46,220
every fight I had a sinus infection

2559
01:52:46,220 --> 01:52:49,550
and I was even smart about my training.
I still got sinus infections.

2560
01:52:49,551 --> 01:52:52,100
Did you monitor your heart rate?
Do you?

2561
01:52:52,130 --> 01:52:54,650
Did you wake up in the morning and just 
never really did that?

2562
01:52:54,890 --> 01:52:59,890
It's one of the things that steve 
maxwell told me he said was very 

2563
01:52:59,890 --> 01:52:59,890
important to find out where you're at.
He goes,

2564
01:53:00,050 --> 01:53:05,050
when you're in shape goes find out what 
your resting heart rate is measured in 

2565
01:53:05,050 --> 01:53:06,680
the morning and if you wake up in the 
morning and it's five to 10 beats over,

2566
01:53:06,681 --> 01:53:11,681
what it normally is,
take the day off is if your body's 

2567
01:53:11,681 --> 01:53:14,500
fighting something off and you probably 
won't even think that you just got to 

2568
01:53:14,500 --> 01:53:17,950
push through,
but when you push through in those exit 

2569
01:53:17,950 --> 01:53:17,950
where that's when you break yourself 
down.

2570
01:53:17,950 --> 01:53:21,230
It's that balance between being 
intelligent and being tough,

2571
01:53:21,260 --> 01:53:26,260
being disciplined,
but also being like calculated and 

2572
01:53:26,260 --> 01:53:27,230
that's where I think your team is very 
important.

2573
01:53:27,230 --> 01:53:29,270
You have to have someone like,
um,

2574
01:53:29,271 --> 01:53:31,180
I had it in my camp,
but if you look at for,

2575
01:53:31,550 --> 01:53:33,610
for us,
and tristar will use that as an example.

2576
01:53:33,611 --> 01:53:37,220
He monitors everything,
so he probably looks at george and says,

2577
01:53:37,221 --> 01:53:37,640
you know,
george,

2578
01:53:37,641 --> 01:53:40,880
you're a little off today.
Like from the way george comes in,

2579
01:53:40,881 --> 01:53:43,160
he probably knows already.
How's his mood?

2580
01:53:43,190 --> 01:53:44,810
Is he,
is he angry right now?

2581
01:53:44,811 --> 01:53:49,811
Is he cranky?
Is a snappy with his words like what's 

2582
01:53:49,811 --> 01:53:49,811
he doing?
You know,

2583
01:53:49,811 --> 01:53:51,980
because you've been around the fighter 
so long that it's there.

2584
01:53:51,981 --> 01:53:53,140
Like my coach will say,
okay,

2585
01:53:53,180 --> 01:53:54,740
it's time to take the day off.
I was like,

2586
01:53:54,741 --> 01:53:55,080
no,
no,

2587
01:53:55,081 --> 01:53:56,840
no.
I'm going to train them as they take the

2588
01:53:56,840 --> 01:54:00,590
day off and then I'll take a day off and
come back and I'm beasting it in the gym

2589
01:54:00,591 --> 01:54:05,591
the next day where I would have just 
continually beat down my body and never 

2590
01:54:05,591 --> 01:54:06,200
really recovered and got better.

2591
01:54:06,410 --> 01:54:07,060
Right.
Let's do it.

2592
01:54:07,061 --> 01:54:08,960
like you woulD come in and you'd feel 
kind of flat,

2593
01:54:08,961 --> 01:54:09,750
you'd be like,
fuck this,

2594
01:54:09,751 --> 01:54:10,970
I got to push thRough this.
Yeah.

2595
01:54:11,300 --> 01:54:13,190
Well sometimes it's important to push 
through it,

2596
01:54:13,250 --> 01:54:15,440
but other times when you know you're at 
that level,

2597
01:54:15,441 --> 01:54:16,040
it's like,
hey,

2598
01:54:16,070 --> 01:54:21,070
you got to pull yourself back.
See that's the crazy thing about 

2599
01:54:21,070 --> 01:54:21,070
fighting and training and learning and 
fucks with your mind.

2600
01:54:21,070 --> 01:54:24,290
Yeah,
I mean it's such a way you might be able

2601
01:54:24,291 --> 01:54:27,470
to do it and pull it off and it might 
not be the right way,

2602
01:54:27,471 --> 01:54:30,020
but it might be successful until you do 
it that way every time.

2603
01:54:30,500 --> 01:54:35,500
I mean,
I've had finders telling me there's no 

2604
01:54:35,500 --> 01:54:35,500
such thing as over training and I'm 
like,

2605
01:54:35,500 --> 01:54:36,020
well that's crazy because it's 
definitely.

2606
01:54:36,160 --> 01:54:37,520
You're not training hard enough.
Well,

2607
01:54:37,521 --> 01:54:40,170
there's definitely such a thing as 
overtraining is,

2608
01:54:40,280 --> 01:54:41,420
but a lot of guys have done it.

2609
01:54:41,450 --> 01:54:44,180
If you're constantly steady with your 
training,

2610
01:54:44,520 --> 01:54:45,540
you're not training.
Right?

2611
01:54:46,010 --> 01:54:49,160
You better be getting yourself to the 
point in your training.

2612
01:54:49,520 --> 01:54:54,520
Everyone was asking me,
I trained once a day and usually once a 

2613
01:54:54,520 --> 01:54:56,060
day I never.
And saturdays I would train twice,

2614
01:54:56,150 --> 01:54:59,180
but the morning was a strength,
a strength training.

2615
01:54:59,450 --> 01:55:02,130
And then the night was kickbox.
And now when you say strength training,

2616
01:55:02,131 --> 01:55:03,380
like what did that involve?
Well,

2617
01:55:03,381 --> 01:55:05,720
I would,
I would do my mind depending on the day,

2618
01:55:05,721 --> 01:55:08,060
I would do a push day,
a pull down a lower body day.

2619
01:55:08,420 --> 01:55:09,890
So lifting weights,
lifting weights,

2620
01:55:09,891 --> 01:55:10,430
yeah,
strength.

2621
01:55:10,440 --> 01:55:13,010
They was always lifting weights and I 
used weight training.

2622
01:55:13,250 --> 01:55:18,250
So for example,
I would kick box like monday and 

2623
01:55:18,250 --> 01:55:18,250
tuesday,
just once a day,

2624
01:55:18,440 --> 01:55:21,380
but that hour and a half session I left 
everything.

2625
01:55:21,530 --> 01:55:26,530
when I hit the bag I couldn't hit 10 
rounds of bag because after round three 

2626
01:55:26,530 --> 01:55:27,200
I'm gassed.

2627
01:55:27,200 --> 01:55:29,360
I'm putting all my force,
all my energy.

2628
01:55:29,630 --> 01:55:32,570
I'm training for a nine minute fight.
I'm not training for a marathon.

2629
01:55:33,050 --> 01:55:38,050
So you need to train the proper energy 
system in order to be the most 

2630
01:55:38,050 --> 01:55:40,010
successful.
and that's kind of that anaerobic system

2631
01:55:40,011 --> 01:55:43,590
of constantly pushing yourself,
letting yourself recover yourself,

2632
01:55:43,591 --> 01:55:45,360
letting yourself recover.
If I'm constantly,

2633
01:55:45,630 --> 01:55:47,850
that's why I never ran a day in my 
career.

2634
01:55:47,940 --> 01:55:50,300
You never ran.
Never ran a day in my career.

2635
01:55:50,350 --> 01:55:55,350
Wow.
I did not hit the road a day in my 

2636
01:55:55,350 --> 01:55:55,350
career.
Wow.

2637
01:55:55,350 --> 01:55:57,570
That's shocking to a lot of people.
Me included.

2638
01:55:57,720 --> 01:55:59,100
Everyone's.
Everyone who hears.

2639
01:55:59,101 --> 01:55:59,780
It's like,
you're nuts.

2640
01:55:59,781 --> 01:56:00,690
You're crazy.
I said,

2641
01:56:00,691 --> 01:56:05,691
why give me one good reason why I can 
give you one is if you need that time to

2642
01:56:06,241 --> 01:56:11,241
reflect,
if you need that time to mentally 

2643
01:56:11,241 --> 01:56:13,881
prepare yourself,
but what Does it do for you in the 

2644
01:56:13,881 --> 01:56:13,881
fight?

2645
01:56:13,881 --> 01:56:14,700
are you ever going to run 10 k in a 
fight?

2646
01:56:15,350 --> 01:56:16,560
No,
it's a sprint.

2647
01:56:17,130 --> 01:56:18,610
So you see sprinters,
I,

2648
01:56:18,840 --> 01:56:23,840
you know,
usain boLt doing take 10 k runs every 

2649
01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:28,010
morning.
He might do it to loosen up and stay 

2650
01:56:28,010 --> 01:56:28,010
relaxed,
but there's other ways of doing it.

2651
01:56:28,010 --> 01:56:29,490
You've mentioned it on your podcast 
shadowboxing.

2652
01:56:29,880 --> 01:56:33,750
Instead of going for a 10 k run shadow 
box for 20 minutes,

2653
01:56:34,150 --> 01:56:37,740
you go into the ring and shadowbox 
envision your opponent.

2654
01:56:37,950 --> 01:56:40,200
I'm fighting Raymond Daniels.
I'm going to press your fight,

2655
01:56:40,201 --> 01:56:45,201
Raymond Daniels.
So I'm going to shadow box for 20 

2656
01:56:45,201 --> 01:56:45,201
minutes in the ring.
Like,

2657
01:56:45,201 --> 01:56:45,330
um,
pressure fighting,

2658
01:56:45,331 --> 01:56:48,210
Raymond Daniels.
I mentally focusing myself.

2659
01:56:48,390 --> 01:56:53,390
I am using the right energy system 
because I can pick up my intensity as 

2660
01:56:53,390 --> 01:56:53,610
much as I want.
If I'm.

2661
01:56:53,611 --> 01:56:55,410
If I just want to stay loose,
I just won't punch.

2662
01:56:55,560 --> 01:57:00,560
I might not even punch.
I might just use my footwork within the 

2663
01:57:00,560 --> 01:57:01,650
ring to kind of just set my mind,
set my feet.

2664
01:57:02,040 --> 01:57:04,230
but there's so many different ways you 
can skip.

2665
01:57:04,620 --> 01:57:05,850
You can,
you know.

2666
01:57:06,540 --> 01:57:08,490
Sometimes I do light training on the 
bag.

2667
01:57:08,520 --> 01:57:13,520
I'll do some light rounds on different 
bags just to warm uP my hands and my 

2668
01:57:13,520 --> 01:57:15,690
body and that kinda thing,
but I never ran too much damage.

2669
01:57:15,710 --> 01:57:17,370
You're,
you're running shin splints,

2670
01:57:17,371 --> 01:57:20,880
the damage on your joints and it didn't 
hit the energy system.

2671
01:57:20,881 --> 01:57:22,380
You hit in fighting,
so why do it?

2672
01:57:22,920 --> 01:57:27,920
That's really interesting because you 
always had a very high output work 

2673
01:57:27,920 --> 01:57:29,940
output when your fights and you had very
good endurance in your fights.

2674
01:57:29,941 --> 01:57:34,941
Everyone thought there was a secret.
I said I trained hard and an hour and a 

2675
01:57:34,941 --> 01:57:35,880
half.
I trained hard.

2676
01:57:36,360 --> 01:57:38,070
When I hit the bag,
I hit the bag.

2677
01:57:38,071 --> 01:57:43,071
I wasn't looking around at the time 
looking at how much time's left on the 

2678
01:57:43,071 --> 01:57:43,200
clock.
I,

2679
01:57:43,410 --> 01:57:47,740
I hit the bag if I knew I was doing,
if I was working something technical,

2680
01:57:47,741 --> 01:57:48,240
they're drilling.

2681
01:57:48,240 --> 01:57:50,610
It's different,
but when it's time to work,

2682
01:57:50,611 --> 01:57:55,611
you got to put the work in you gotta be 
able to cut out all those distractions 

2683
01:57:55,611 --> 01:57:58,620
that you have and it doesn't matter what
you have to do after.

2684
01:57:58,621 --> 01:58:01,170
It doesn't matter what's going on in 
your day.

2685
01:58:01,171 --> 01:58:04,620
If your girlfriend or boyfriend broke up
with you or whatever the frick it is,

2686
01:58:04,621 --> 01:58:07,890
you got to be focused and you have an 
hour and a half to do it.

2687
01:58:08,190 --> 01:58:13,190
Now,
when you see mma fighters that are 

2688
01:58:13,190 --> 01:58:13,190
putting in two a days on a regular,
sometimes three,

2689
01:58:13,590 --> 01:58:15,000
what do you.
What do you think of that?

2690
01:58:15,270 --> 01:58:17,400
I think it's okay if you're doing it 
right.

2691
01:58:17,760 --> 01:58:21,210
I mean you mma,
there's more things happening,

2692
01:58:21,240 --> 01:58:26,240
right?
So if you're doing a role in the 

2693
01:58:26,240 --> 01:58:26,240
morning,
you know it's okay,

2694
01:58:26,240 --> 01:58:30,561
but you're not going to go the hardest 
role you have and then hit the hardest 

2695
01:58:30,561 --> 01:58:33,711
strength and conditioning you have,
and then at night do your hardest 

2696
01:58:33,711 --> 01:58:33,711
kickboxing session.

2697
01:58:33,711 --> 01:58:35,910
There's no way.
The next day you're actually putting 100

2698
01:58:35,911 --> 01:58:37,710
percent of your energy in those 
sessions.

2699
01:58:38,100 --> 01:58:41,000
So maybe sometimes if they're doing 
three,

2700
01:58:41,240 --> 01:58:44,170
they might put 60 percent in each 
session.

2701
01:58:44,950 --> 01:58:47,800
You're never really hitting that last 40
percent,

2702
01:58:48,070 --> 01:58:51,910
which is probably the place you want to 
be.

2703
01:58:52,240 --> 01:58:55,960
You want to be in that place where 
you're not comfortable.

2704
01:58:56,080 --> 01:59:01,080
You wAnt to be in that place where 
you're tired because that's what 

2705
01:59:01,080 --> 01:59:03,811
fighting is.
Getting yourself to that point you want 

2706
01:59:03,811 --> 01:59:06,420
to throw up if you have to,
you know it's is they say it's your.

2707
01:59:06,500 --> 01:59:11,170
Your mind gives up before the body does.
So when you're tired and you starting to

2708
01:59:11,171 --> 01:59:13,520
feel all that lactic acid and you shut 
down,

2709
01:59:13,550 --> 01:59:18,550
they say it's your brain shutting down 
first and you have some time to keep 

2710
01:59:18,550 --> 01:59:18,550
going.
So you've got to prepare your mind to be

2711
01:59:18,550 --> 01:59:23,521
able to withstand that.
If you're hitting bag for 10 rounds and 

2712
01:59:23,521 --> 01:59:23,521
you're looking around and you're fucking
around,

2713
01:59:23,521 --> 01:59:27,751
like what do you,
what are you accomplishing that unless 

2714
01:59:27,751 --> 01:59:30,841
you're working on technique or warm up,
but you have everything has to have a 

2715
01:59:31,061 --> 01:59:31,660
purpose.

2716
01:59:31,810 --> 01:59:34,120
I don't believe in doing something that 
doesn't have a purpose.

2717
01:59:34,330 --> 01:59:39,330
What's one of the things that I really 
like about the way you drill and one 

2718
01:59:39,330 --> 01:59:41,971
things I like about the way you shadow 
box is that you do everything like your 

2719
01:59:41,971 --> 01:59:44,290
inner fight.
everything guard is high stances.

2720
01:59:44,291 --> 01:59:45,820
Perfect.
Footwork is perfect.

2721
01:59:46,360 --> 01:59:51,360
When you say that you lift weights,
like what kind of weight lifting where 

2722
01:59:51,360 --> 01:59:53,030
you're doing once a week.
Um,

2723
01:59:53,080 --> 01:59:53,480
it,
it's,

2724
01:59:53,490 --> 01:59:55,600
it's the basics,
but the most effective.

2725
01:59:55,601 --> 01:59:57,580
So I would do,
I always squatting.

2726
01:59:57,670 --> 02:00:00,700
Squatting is very important.
Why do you think squatting so important?

2727
02:00:00,701 --> 02:00:03,100
Lower body when,
when everything in,

2728
02:00:03,101 --> 02:00:05,650
in athletic movements comes from the 
lower body,

2729
02:00:05,920 --> 02:00:08,410
you have to have strong hips,
know your glutes,

2730
02:00:08,411 --> 02:00:11,200
got to be firing at a level.
And you know when you punch,

2731
02:00:11,201 --> 02:00:13,240
when you kick,
everything comes from your lower body.

2732
02:00:13,360 --> 02:00:14,620
And that's what people don't understand.

2733
02:00:14,620 --> 02:00:16,860
So we'll use squatting heavy.
We use quoting lightweights,

2734
02:00:16,861 --> 02:00:19,030
low a high reps,
depends what phase I'm in.

2735
02:00:19,031 --> 02:00:24,031
If I was in hypertrophy phase,
I was probably doing 10 sets of 10 on a 

2736
02:00:24,031 --> 02:00:24,031
lower weight.
Um,

2737
02:00:24,031 --> 02:00:27,550
as I was in power strength phase,
I was doing five sets of five.

2738
02:00:27,850 --> 02:00:32,850
As I was more the explosive phase,
I would do more of like five sets of 

2739
02:00:32,850 --> 02:00:37,231
three and then I'd maybe super setted 
with an explosive jump or a standing 

2740
02:00:37,231 --> 02:00:38,500
long jump or a,
you know,

2741
02:00:38,501 --> 02:00:43,501
a skater style movement.
But I'd always use it at that sprint 

2742
02:00:43,501 --> 02:00:44,470
some.
There's one times where I would do,

2743
02:00:44,720 --> 02:00:49,720
you know,
five heavy explosive squats and then I 

2744
02:00:49,720 --> 02:00:53,611
would line up on the track right after 
my set and I would do like 10 yard 

2745
02:00:53,611 --> 02:00:58,201
sprints just to work that explosiveness.
So that whole point of getting 

2746
02:00:58,201 --> 02:01:01,141
strengthened to explosiveness.
So that kind of running you believed in 

2747
02:01:01,141 --> 02:01:02,660
was just that little bit but not,
but not too much.

2748
02:01:02,660 --> 02:01:04,390
That would be like once or twice in a 
camp.

2749
02:01:04,820 --> 02:01:07,150
otherwise I know my central nervous 
system was gonna,

2750
02:01:07,180 --> 02:01:09,580
shut down no shadow once or twice in a 
camp.

2751
02:01:09,730 --> 02:01:14,730
I wouldn't do it very often.
Even that sled running all the guys 

2752
02:01:14,730 --> 02:01:15,280
doing the prowler poles and sleds,
if I did that,

2753
02:01:15,550 --> 02:01:20,550
I'd be out of commission for a week 
because my body would just take a 

2754
02:01:20,550 --> 02:01:24,421
beating and then I would,
I wouldn't be able to function and do 

2755
02:01:24,421 --> 02:01:26,190
what I really had to do,
which was kickbox next.

2756
02:01:26,540 --> 02:01:27,450
Right,
right.

2757
02:01:27,580 --> 02:01:32,580
So it had to have a purpose.
I would do it as a mental test for 

2758
02:01:32,580 --> 02:01:32,890
myself.
I would do it as,

2759
02:01:32,891 --> 02:01:33,580
um,
you know,

2760
02:01:33,581 --> 02:01:36,340
my weight's not coming off right now.
I'm holding a lot of water.

2761
02:01:36,400 --> 02:01:41,400
Let's run the sleds.
I use that as that more than just 

2762
02:01:41,400 --> 02:01:41,600
constantly.
If you're running the prowler everyday,

2763
02:01:41,601 --> 02:01:44,720
your nervous system is taking a freaking
beating right now.

2764
02:01:44,720 --> 02:01:46,290
What about nutrition?
Like what,

2765
02:01:46,291 --> 02:01:48,890
what did you eat and how did you 
nutrition?

2766
02:01:48,891 --> 02:01:53,891
I was a little bit.
I wasn't super calculated as people are 

2767
02:01:53,891 --> 02:01:55,650
today with counting their macros and 
micros and I was,

2768
02:01:56,300 --> 02:01:59,780
that's too complicated and I don't 
believe in over complicating things.

2769
02:01:59,781 --> 02:02:02,180
I love the basics.
I believe in the basics,

2770
02:02:03,140 --> 02:02:08,140
so I never over complicated things.
I knew what good carbs and bad carbs 

2771
02:02:08,140 --> 02:02:10,400
were.
I knew good timing when to eat.

2772
02:02:10,640 --> 02:02:12,830
I knew what things I should be eating 
when,

2773
02:02:13,100 --> 02:02:16,490
but I never really counted how many 
calories I was eating in my day.

2774
02:02:16,640 --> 02:02:21,640
I just knew through experience,
like it just came through experience and

2775
02:02:21,641 --> 02:02:23,420
practicing and playing around with my 
body.

2776
02:02:23,421 --> 02:02:28,421
There's no cookie cutter approach to it.
So like what would a typical meal be 

2777
02:02:28,421 --> 02:02:30,590
like for dinner?
It would always be a balanced meal,

2778
02:02:30,630 --> 02:02:35,630
have a little bit of protein,
a little bit of carbs and some 

2779
02:02:35,630 --> 02:02:35,630
vegetable.

2780
02:02:35,630 --> 02:02:37,010
There's always has the three.
At first when I was doing,

2781
02:02:37,011 --> 02:02:38,150
when I first started fighting,
I was like,

2782
02:02:38,151 --> 02:02:39,920
oh,
carbs make you fat,

2783
02:02:40,040 --> 02:02:45,040
carbs make you fat,
and like everyone thinks that everyone 

2784
02:02:45,040 --> 02:02:47,651
wants to die at.
The first thing they think they have to 

2785
02:02:47,651 --> 02:02:49,241
do is cut their carbs out.
But now there's all this new research 

2786
02:02:49,241 --> 02:02:52,241
about fats and how important is 
intermittent fasting and how important 

2787
02:02:52,241 --> 02:02:56,240
it is to to keep high fats in your diet.
So got a guys are doing the avocados and

2788
02:02:56,540 --> 02:03:01,400
coconut oils to kind of get that fat,
but I just liked the balanced meal.

2789
02:03:01,401 --> 02:03:05,030
I'd rather lower my protein and have a 
good carbohydrate,

2790
02:03:05,031 --> 02:03:09,770
whIch is my first line of energy,
so I would eat a lot of sweet potatoes.

2791
02:03:09,771 --> 02:03:14,771
keen was big potatoes sometimes with 
vitamins.

2792
02:03:15,350 --> 02:03:17,770
Not much.
Omega threes usually.

2793
02:03:18,030 --> 02:03:19,460
Um,
that's about it.

2794
02:03:20,080 --> 02:03:21,890
I take an electrolyte after training.

2795
02:03:23,060 --> 02:03:24,560
That's about it.
nothing crazy.

2796
02:03:24,920 --> 02:03:25,670
Now.
What about,

2797
02:03:25,690 --> 02:03:27,130
um,
dId you do anything for.

2798
02:03:27,250 --> 02:03:28,370
Go ahead.
I was going to say it,

2799
02:03:28,400 --> 02:03:31,640
but I wasn't the guy that if I knew how 
to fight,

2800
02:03:31,970 --> 02:03:34,820
I cut weight from eight weeks out.
It wasn't like,

2801
02:03:34,821 --> 02:03:37,070
hey,
I'm going to just eat like shit and then

2802
02:03:37,190 --> 02:03:38,150
I'll deal with it.
No,

2803
02:03:38,230 --> 02:03:42,670
eight weeks out my diet started with my 
right to refill your body fat.

2804
02:03:42,710 --> 02:03:47,710
I only want to lose two pounds a week.
Anything more than two pounds a week 

2805
02:03:47,710 --> 02:03:51,041
becomes unhealthy.
So I'd get to about 10 to 12 pounds a 

2806
02:03:51,041 --> 02:03:51,530
week before my fight.
And that was it.

2807
02:03:51,531 --> 02:03:53,510
Once I was there that last week was all 
water.

2808
02:03:54,020 --> 02:03:55,830
And did you do any like,
um,

2809
02:03:55,910 --> 02:03:59,150
deep tissue massage or any ice baths or 
anything like that?

2810
02:03:59,680 --> 02:04:00,610
That,
yeah,

2811
02:04:01,030 --> 02:04:01,350
yeah,
I did,

2812
02:04:01,550 --> 02:04:03,230
but not.
It wasn't a big focus.

2813
02:04:03,231 --> 02:04:05,180
I did a lot of rolling out,
stretching,

2814
02:04:05,600 --> 02:04:08,930
that kind of thing,
but I liked epsom salt baths.

2815
02:04:09,430 --> 02:04:14,430
I love that.
Some people are obsessed with deep 

2816
02:04:14,430 --> 02:04:14,430
tissue though.
I know guys like get deep tissue massage

2817
02:04:14,430 --> 02:04:16,010
every day after training.
And you've done that.

2818
02:04:16,040 --> 02:04:18,740
Was it the cairo?
I just said cryotherapy.

2819
02:04:18,741 --> 02:04:20,070
Cryo.
Yeah.

2820
02:04:20,090 --> 02:04:21,560
That's intense.
Love it.

2821
02:04:22,100 --> 02:04:22,940
He's never done it.
No,

2822
02:04:22,941 --> 02:04:23,930
I haven't done it.
You want to do It?

2823
02:04:24,160 --> 02:04:25,310
I'll do it.
I'll do it today.

2824
02:04:25,370 --> 02:04:27,530
I'll take you done.
I've never done it.

2825
02:04:27,560 --> 02:04:28,240
Oh,
you'll love it.

2826
02:04:28,900 --> 02:04:31,230
Freak you out.
It's just.

2827
02:04:31,250 --> 02:04:32,480
You can't believe how cold it is.
You're like,

2828
02:04:32,481 --> 02:04:33,830
how the fuck is this?
I was like,

2829
02:04:33,831 --> 02:04:35,510
I gotta try it.
I got to try it.

2830
02:04:35,511 --> 02:04:36,770
But yeah,
never really.

2831
02:04:36,830 --> 02:04:38,160
Two 50 degrees below zero.

2832
02:04:38,660 --> 02:04:40,440
And how long you in there for like 10,
20 minutes.

2833
02:04:41,130 --> 02:04:42,000
Three minutes?
Yeah.

2834
02:04:42,001 --> 02:04:44,160
Well you'll do a minute and a half.
They won't let you go more than a minute

2835
02:04:44,161 --> 02:04:47,420
and a half for the first time.
Was trying to say I'm soft.

2836
02:04:47,500 --> 02:04:48,440
No for anyone.
I know.

2837
02:04:48,490 --> 02:04:50,160
It's just the rule.
The second time you'll do it.

2838
02:04:50,310 --> 02:04:51,210
How long do you go in?
For?

2839
02:04:51,270 --> 02:04:53,040
Three minutes.
I've done 3:40,

2840
02:04:53,280 --> 02:04:55,860
I saw longest I've ever done those last 
40 minutes.

2841
02:04:56,190 --> 02:04:59,040
Three minutes of hell.
Or is it three minutes of.

2842
02:04:59,100 --> 02:05:02,100
It's not fun.
It's a jamie's done it.

2843
02:05:02,130 --> 02:05:03,540
You've done it.
What is it like jamie?

2844
02:05:03,541 --> 02:05:06,540
Describe it.
It's not really claustrophobic isn't the

2845
02:05:06,541 --> 02:05:11,541
word because there's a kind of.
You can get in your heads above it and 

2846
02:05:11,541 --> 02:05:13,320
you can still talk,
but this is not like that.

2847
02:05:13,370 --> 02:05:14,610
You're heading to.
Yeah.

2848
02:05:14,611 --> 02:05:17,130
You're in a,
you're in a meat locker essentially.

2849
02:05:17,160 --> 02:05:19,770
Where they,
the liquid nitrogen cools the oxygen.

2850
02:05:19,800 --> 02:05:20,650
it's not,
you know,

2851
02:05:20,750 --> 02:05:23,040
like that woman that died in vegas.
Do you know that story?

2852
02:05:23,270 --> 02:05:23,910
No.
Well,

2853
02:05:23,911 --> 02:05:24,480
she,
uh,

2854
02:05:24,510 --> 02:05:29,510
she said it herself and apparently she 
was kinda short and her mouth was below 

2855
02:05:30,811 --> 02:05:35,811
the outer lip and so she was breathing 
in the liquid nitrogen and you can't,

2856
02:05:36,100 --> 02:05:38,460
that's like getting choked out.
You have no oxygen.

2857
02:05:38,461 --> 02:05:43,110
So she just fell asleep and she froze to
death and they found her the next day.

2858
02:05:43,111 --> 02:05:44,040
Frozen solid.
See,

2859
02:05:44,041 --> 02:05:46,140
this is the kind I always see the heads 
out.

2860
02:05:46,170 --> 02:05:47,620
Yeah.
That's the kind that they,

2861
02:05:47,650 --> 02:05:50,850
that most people do where your head is 
out and your body's freezing.

2862
02:05:50,851 --> 02:05:55,851
But look how much fun she's having.
She's having a great time having a 

2863
02:05:55,851 --> 02:05:55,851
blast.
She's doing an ad.

2864
02:05:55,851 --> 02:05:57,950
The kind I do.
If you go to cryo healthcare,

2865
02:05:57,960 --> 02:05:59,940
jamie,
the kind we do,

2866
02:05:59,970 --> 02:06:04,080
you have to wear a mask.
You wear like a surgeon's mask over your

2867
02:06:04,081 --> 02:06:04,530
face.

2868
02:06:04,530 --> 02:06:08,260
You wear ear muffs,
you wear gloves and you wear slippers.

2869
02:06:08,430 --> 02:06:13,430
Yeah.
You wear socks and then you were like 

2870
02:06:13,430 --> 02:06:14,480
rubber crocs and you,
uh,

2871
02:06:14,510 --> 02:06:18,600
you step in there and you're inside a 
chamber.

2872
02:06:18,630 --> 02:06:21,990
We'll see if they have some images so 
you can see what it looks like.

2873
02:06:21,991 --> 02:06:24,000
You've done that sensory deprivation 
stuff.

2874
02:06:24,030 --> 02:06:25,440
I have one of my basement.
Yeah.

2875
02:06:25,500 --> 02:06:26,220
Yeah.
Love it.

2876
02:06:26,430 --> 02:06:28,260
I do that all the time now.
giant.

2877
02:06:28,560 --> 02:06:30,480
If you're claustrophobic,
good or bad,

2878
02:06:30,960 --> 02:06:32,580
someone says you don't even think about 
it.

2879
02:06:32,581 --> 02:06:35,340
It's not the best thing for people who 
are claustrophobic,

2880
02:06:35,341 --> 02:06:37,350
but claustrophobia is psychological.
see,

2881
02:06:37,351 --> 02:06:38,970
that's where it is.
See how these guys,

2882
02:06:39,210 --> 02:06:41,990
that's how they're dressed.
And the ear muffs and the,

2883
02:06:42,050 --> 02:06:43,370
the,
the um,

2884
02:06:43,470 --> 02:06:45,740
masks.
And so you go in that one chamber that's

2885
02:06:45,750 --> 02:06:50,750
on the right,
that's where you take off the robe and 

2886
02:06:50,750 --> 02:06:51,810
then you step into the one on the left 
and that one is the one where you freeze

2887
02:06:51,811 --> 02:06:52,470
your dick off.

2888
02:06:52,470 --> 02:06:57,470
And so you'll do a and a little bit.
We're going to take you over there and 

2889
02:06:57,470 --> 02:06:57,830
do about a minute and a half.
And they're so awesome.

2890
02:06:57,860 --> 02:06:59,730
Love to man.
um,

2891
02:06:59,790 --> 02:07:01,950
so I just want to know about it because 
people keep asking me.

2892
02:07:02,070 --> 02:07:03,240
It's great.
Well,

2893
02:07:03,390 --> 02:07:08,390
dr rhonda patrick,
who's actually on tomorrow who's a huge 

2894
02:07:08,390 --> 02:07:12,081
proponent of both sauna and cold shock 
therapy and she believes that a heat 

2895
02:07:12,661 --> 02:07:17,310
shock proteins and cold shock proteins 
like that you get from sauna and you get

2896
02:07:17,311 --> 02:07:22,311
from a cryotherapy.
They proviDe your body with a some 

2897
02:07:22,531 --> 02:07:27,030
incredible anti-inflammatory responses 
and your body.

2898
02:07:27,090 --> 02:07:29,610
Essentially when you go to a sauna,
your body's freaking out.

2899
02:07:29,611 --> 02:07:30,930
You're biased.
Like what the fuck?

2900
02:07:31,170 --> 02:07:31,880
It's so hot.
And,

2901
02:07:31,881 --> 02:07:36,881
but if you do it in a controlled 
environment for a certain amount of 

2902
02:07:36,881 --> 02:07:39,621
time,
your body produces these heat shock 

2903
02:07:39,621 --> 02:07:39,621
proteins that are really beneficial for 
you.

2904
02:07:39,621 --> 02:07:44,490
And so she believes in the sauna like 
she thinks there was a study that she 

2905
02:07:44,490 --> 02:07:49,081
was talking about where the sauna showed
a 50 percent drop in mortality across 

2906
02:07:49,541 --> 02:07:53,710
the board from all things,
whether it's from cancer disease,

2907
02:07:53,711 --> 02:07:57,310
all these different things like the 
people who regularly did sauna,

2908
02:07:57,820 --> 02:08:02,820
such a healthy response to that sauna 
and having those inflammatory markers 

2909
02:08:03,530 --> 02:08:08,530
reduced in the blood.
There it is using the sauna four to 

2910
02:08:08,530 --> 02:08:08,530
seven times per week associated with 
those 40 percent,

2911
02:08:08,530 --> 02:08:10,900
40 percent lower,
all caused mortality.

2912
02:08:11,050 --> 02:08:12,100
That's crazy.
Yeah.

2913
02:08:12,280 --> 02:08:14,380
I was reading something that tim 
ferriss,

2914
02:08:14,580 --> 02:08:18,700
he has a book now called tools of the 
titans and he someone he,

2915
02:08:18,701 --> 02:08:23,701
I guess he,
he has his own podcast or someone just 

2916
02:08:23,701 --> 02:08:27,180
very good for me and he basically talks 
to all the top people are in their 

2917
02:08:27,671 --> 02:08:32,671
field.
And so he wrote a list of like all the 

2918
02:08:32,671 --> 02:08:35,761
tips that these people suggested and a 
lot of them was ensena and baths.

2919
02:08:36,100 --> 02:08:38,860
And I never really got into too much of 
the science behind it.

2920
02:08:38,861 --> 02:08:40,240
But these,
you know,

2921
02:08:40,241 --> 02:08:45,241
people in this field are saying sauna 
three times a week is probably one of 

2922
02:08:45,241 --> 02:08:45,940
the best things you can do for yourself.
Yeah.

2923
02:08:45,941 --> 02:08:48,460
When she was writing there hsp,
that's what she's talking about.

2924
02:08:48,461 --> 02:08:52,870
Heat shock proteins and I bet you could 
probably reproduce that with a hot bath.

2925
02:08:53,320 --> 02:08:55,140
That's what hsp,
um,

2926
02:08:55,610 --> 02:09:00,610
side of keen's to the.
That's also what you're getting from 

2927
02:09:00,610 --> 02:09:00,850
cryotherapy.
You're getting these,

2928
02:09:00,880 --> 02:09:05,880
these anti inflammatory responses and I 
think you probably could get it from hot

2929
02:09:06,281 --> 02:09:08,230
yoga too.
[inaudible] hot yoga,

2930
02:09:08,231 --> 02:09:10,690
you get so fucking hot,
Ohio.

2931
02:09:10,800 --> 02:09:12,310
I love it.
I did it.

2932
02:09:12,320 --> 02:09:13,990
It took a little break.
But I'm starting again.

2933
02:09:14,020 --> 02:09:14,830
Oh,
it's amazing.

2934
02:09:14,860 --> 02:09:19,860
It's amazing for flexibility in the 
class I was in was an hour and a half 

2935
02:09:19,860 --> 02:09:21,700
and that was long,
long sucks.

2936
02:09:22,360 --> 02:09:24,010
The last 15 minutes are bullshit.

2937
02:09:24,300 --> 02:09:29,300
The last one he literally sit up,
lay down or something that I sit up and 

2938
02:09:29,300 --> 02:09:29,300
then we're like,
oh shit,

2939
02:09:29,300 --> 02:09:30,280
I'm dying.
It's brutal.

2940
02:09:30,281 --> 02:09:32,080
You definitely get used to it though.
But you know,

2941
02:09:32,081 --> 02:09:34,320
I've seen like girls that go to my 
place,

2942
02:09:34,321 --> 02:09:36,700
it will take two classes in a row.
So I feel like such a pussy.

2943
02:09:36,810 --> 02:09:38,740
Yeah,
they're there for three hours.

2944
02:09:38,830 --> 02:09:40,290
I'm sitting there struggling and 
falling.

2945
02:09:40,310 --> 02:09:45,310
This old lady besides killing it,
I have to use the little foam blocks 

2946
02:09:45,310 --> 02:09:47,020
that sit down and everyone was just 
laughing.

2947
02:09:47,021 --> 02:09:50,700
You can see all the mirrors.
The mirrors make it worse than ever feel

2948
02:09:50,730 --> 02:09:53,080
the whole place is staring at me.
Especially they're looking at you.

2949
02:09:53,081 --> 02:09:58,081
This fucking muscular 60 year old lady 
has got a foot above her head and went 

2950
02:09:58,900 --> 02:10:01,180
with when I was going was with my ex 
girlfriend.

2951
02:10:01,540 --> 02:10:02,380
So a lot of the.

2952
02:10:02,380 --> 02:10:04,460
A lot of the old ladies would go with 
that.

2953
02:10:04,480 --> 02:10:07,320
Your boyfriend there is so cute for 
trying those.

2954
02:10:07,510 --> 02:10:12,510
Trying my ass because I'm an athlete and
I'm like I'm not letting this old lady 

2955
02:10:12,510 --> 02:10:13,660
be able to do this shit.
And I was standing here struggling,

2956
02:10:13,661 --> 02:10:18,661
are you crazy?
But it's like what you're talking about 

2957
02:10:18,661 --> 02:10:20,551
before,
if you took a marathon runner and then 

2958
02:10:20,551 --> 02:10:20,551
put them in a pool and there it'd be 
dying.

2959
02:10:20,551 --> 02:10:24,241
You know,
you're an athlete and you're going to 

2960
02:10:24,241 --> 02:10:25,270
try to competitive guy like sweating 
extra from trying so hard.

2961
02:10:25,271 --> 02:10:25,870
Yeah,
that was tough.

2962
02:10:25,871 --> 02:10:27,130
But I love it man.
You know,

2963
02:10:27,131 --> 02:10:30,670
what I feel from yoga and especially 
from the last year with I've been really

2964
02:10:30,671 --> 02:10:33,440
consistent with it,
is that I feel like all the,

2965
02:10:33,770 --> 02:10:35,630
like there's a lot of things that are 
really good for your body.

2966
02:10:35,631 --> 02:10:37,850
I think lifting weights is good for your
body if you do it correctly,

2967
02:10:37,851 --> 02:10:42,851
if for sure martial arts,
all sorts of trainings good for your 

2968
02:10:42,851 --> 02:10:42,851
body.

2969
02:10:42,851 --> 02:10:45,430
But I feel like what yoga does for your 
balance and for all the things that 

2970
02:10:45,591 --> 02:10:48,680
connect,
like for your joints and your spine.

2971
02:10:48,890 --> 02:10:52,640
I've never done anything where I can 
feel my back pop loose.

2972
02:10:53,530 --> 02:10:56,120
Like there's things you do.
Were you in yoga where you,

2973
02:10:56,121 --> 02:11:01,121
um,
you bend down and you reach behind your 

2974
02:11:01,121 --> 02:11:03,410
heels and you tuck your hands under your
heels and then you straighten your legs,

2975
02:11:04,140 --> 02:11:07,760
your body flat into your pulling your 
body apart with your legs.

2976
02:11:07,910 --> 02:11:09,770
Like you're literally pulling your spine
apart.

2977
02:11:09,771 --> 02:11:11,130
You here at gulf dump,
dump,

2978
02:11:11,350 --> 02:11:13,220
dump.
It's so good for you.

2979
02:11:13,221 --> 02:11:14,130
And you leave.
Like,

2980
02:11:14,600 --> 02:11:18,960
I like my back is always like from all 
the years is you just see there's always

2981
02:11:18,961 --> 02:11:20,840
like a pain.
There's always something,

2982
02:11:20,841 --> 02:11:21,570
megan.
Yeah,

2983
02:11:21,590 --> 02:11:24,380
it's always,
but yoga eliminates almost all that shit

2984
02:11:24,430 --> 02:11:28,250
cause even when I was doing it,
like I realized how much scar tissue and

2985
02:11:28,251 --> 02:11:31,100
shit that developed in my joints,
like even if my arm,

2986
02:11:31,101 --> 02:11:36,101
like I can't focus straight in my left 
arm and there's the one where you have 

2987
02:11:36,101 --> 02:11:39,401
to kind of put your pinkies together and
lay on your arms and that really helps 

2988
02:11:39,401 --> 02:11:41,810
stretch it out and I'm like,
oh this stuff's not good.

2989
02:11:41,900 --> 02:11:46,900
And then I'm sitting on the couch at 
home and like I'm sitting in positions 

2990
02:11:46,900 --> 02:11:47,720
where I was like,
my legs are crossed off on him.

2991
02:11:47,721 --> 02:11:52,721
Like I can't even cross my legs and here
I am like in like a mahatma gandhi here 

2992
02:11:52,721 --> 02:11:54,410
with my legs super folded in half.
I was like,

2993
02:11:54,411 --> 02:11:56,630
this is crazy.
And I loved it since then.

2994
02:11:57,110 --> 02:12:02,110
I wasn't consistent with it,
but I said I'm going to be a yoga 

2995
02:12:02,110 --> 02:12:02,110
practitioner for life.
Beautiful.

2996
02:12:02,110 --> 02:12:02,220
Yeah.
It's,

2997
02:12:02,221 --> 02:12:05,750
it's great for mobility and for people 
that just want to be healthier,

2998
02:12:05,751 --> 02:12:09,260
it's for the just the ability to use and
move your body.

2999
02:12:09,320 --> 02:12:14,320
I think it's amazing.
The problem with guys is that negative 

3000
02:12:14,320 --> 02:12:15,600
stereotype who it's so gay to do yoga,
man,

3001
02:12:15,650 --> 02:12:16,530
try it.
Yeah,

3002
02:12:16,700 --> 02:12:21,700
I know.
It's weird that it has that stereotype 

3003
02:12:21,700 --> 02:12:21,710
of why it's so stupid,
but it's incredible.

3004
02:12:21,711 --> 02:12:22,310
I love it.

3005
02:12:22,730 --> 02:12:27,730
It's one of the more underestimated 
things in terms of its difficulty 

3006
02:12:27,730 --> 02:12:28,610
factor,
you know?

3007
02:12:28,640 --> 02:12:32,510
It's just very underestimated.
When do you think mma fighters should be

3008
02:12:32,511 --> 02:12:37,511
doing it?
I think what you were saying about you 

3009
02:12:37,511 --> 02:12:37,790
can only do so many things is very 
important,

3010
02:12:37,791 --> 02:12:42,791
which I think one of the reasons why 
your philosophy about only working out 

3011
02:12:42,791 --> 02:12:42,791
one time a day,
no running,

3012
02:12:42,791 --> 02:12:44,660
I think,
well obviously it worked out great.

3013
02:12:44,720 --> 02:12:49,720
You had amazing success as a fighter and
obviously your endurance with 

3014
02:12:49,720 --> 02:12:50,360
spectacular.
Your output was spectacular.

3015
02:12:50,540 --> 02:12:52,670
I mean you were an aggressive pressure 
fighter,

3016
02:12:52,671 --> 02:12:55,700
so when you say that you had the sort of
measured approach to training,

3017
02:12:55,701 --> 02:13:00,701
I think it's very interesting.
Some of the times I've gotten my ass 

3018
02:13:00,701 --> 02:13:02,030
kicked the most in jujitsu was after I 
took yoga.

3019
02:13:02,330 --> 02:13:07,330
I took yoga in the morning and then I 
went to train at night and just fucking 

3020
02:13:07,330 --> 02:13:07,330
chill.

3021
02:13:07,330 --> 02:13:10,810
They say you have to like give some time
off from one or something because your 

3022
02:13:10,810 --> 02:13:14,771
body is so loose.
The other thing is they say you don't 

3023
02:13:14,771 --> 02:13:17,831
want to overstretch your muscle because 
then you take it out of that optimal 

3024
02:13:17,831 --> 02:13:21,461
range to fire.
So I don't know if you really 

3025
02:13:21,461 --> 02:13:21,680
overstretched things.
I don't know if that's true.

3026
02:13:21,810 --> 02:13:26,810
I I know what you're saying.
I know they say they say that a trench 

3027
02:13:26,810 --> 02:13:27,310
for laura.
I'm like,

3028
02:13:27,400 --> 02:13:28,430
that's.
I don't think that's.

3029
02:13:28,460 --> 02:13:30,140
I don't think that necessarily makes 
sense.

3030
02:13:30,170 --> 02:13:35,170
I think where that where it makes sense 
as you shouldn't stretch out before you 

3031
02:13:35,170 --> 02:13:39,441
do explosive things.
They used to think you should now they 

3032
02:13:39,441 --> 02:13:40,230
think you should warm up and get your 
body sweaty and loose,

3033
02:13:40,410 --> 02:13:44,550
but that an actual stretching will you 
really stretch something out?

3034
02:13:44,551 --> 02:13:48,690
You actually lessen the amount of power 
that you can generate those muscles.

3035
02:13:48,740 --> 02:13:51,660
Yeah,
but I always feel like full mobility.

3036
02:13:51,990 --> 02:13:53,190
I mean,
outside of that,

3037
02:13:53,191 --> 02:13:58,191
I think that's where the argument is and
I think it's obviously correct because 

3038
02:13:58,191 --> 02:14:01,071
there's been research to back it up,
but I don't think there's any research 

3039
02:14:01,071 --> 02:14:02,010
that shows that like being able to do a 
full split in any way.

3040
02:14:02,011 --> 02:14:03,930
We'll take away your kicking power.
Right?

3041
02:14:03,960 --> 02:14:08,960
I mean think about the amount of power 
that a lot of these guys can generate 

3042
02:14:08,960 --> 02:14:12,320
that are really flexible.
I think if there's any that might be a 

3043
02:14:12,320 --> 02:14:17,181
trade off,
like maybe it makes you a little less 

3044
02:14:17,181 --> 02:14:20,600
powerful but a little more mobile and 
then you can generate more power and 

3045
02:14:20,600 --> 02:14:22,080
build more power up and still keep that 
mobility.

3046
02:14:22,260 --> 02:14:27,260
That would be optimum,
but I think there's probably a middle 

3047
02:14:27,260 --> 02:14:28,260
ground there that you need to read.
What do you think of.

3048
02:14:28,261 --> 02:14:33,261
I know george st pierre came and made 
gymnastics popular and then conor 

3049
02:14:33,261 --> 02:14:34,020
mcgregor with that movement.

3050
02:14:34,650 --> 02:14:38,340
What's your take on that movement?
I think footwork is critical in mma.

3051
02:14:38,470 --> 02:14:43,470
I think it's really important to be able
to get out of the way and move in as 

3052
02:14:43,470 --> 02:14:47,661
fast as possible and it's one of the 
things that conor spectacular at is so 

3053
02:14:47,661 --> 02:14:48,840
good at sliding back,
sliding back,

3054
02:14:48,890 --> 02:14:51,420
back,
and he's also.

3055
02:14:51,690 --> 02:14:56,690
There's also a totally different 
philosophy that's a part of striking 

3056
02:14:56,690 --> 02:14:58,680
with those little tiny gloves.
It's much more difficult to put yourself

3057
02:14:58,681 --> 02:14:59,700
up in a shell.
I mean,

3058
02:14:59,701 --> 02:15:01,800
the way he would fight with [inaudible] 
class,

3059
02:15:01,801 --> 02:15:02,600
I really,
you know,

3060
02:15:02,610 --> 02:15:03,930
I'm not kissing your ass anymore.
This is,

3061
02:15:03,931 --> 02:15:07,950
this is the last time,
but I really loved how you were so solid

3062
02:15:07,951 --> 02:15:09,930
rock solid with your defense and your 
fundamentals.

3063
02:15:09,931 --> 02:15:13,110
Chin tucked gloves up high and it was 
very hard to get through that.

3064
02:15:13,500 --> 02:15:18,500
That doesn't necessarily work the same 
way in mma because guys can sneak 

3065
02:15:18,500 --> 02:15:21,831
punches through hard punches around,
but I still think you have to have that 

3066
02:15:22,201 --> 02:15:23,010
as a base.

3067
02:15:23,040 --> 02:15:24,900
I think you're right.
No matter what,

3068
02:15:24,901 --> 02:15:29,901
you're going to get in fight exchanges 
and there's a lot of guys who are good 

3069
02:15:29,901 --> 02:15:30,810
at closing distance,
so isn't.

3070
02:15:30,811 --> 02:15:32,070
It's better to at least,
hey,

3071
02:15:32,071 --> 02:15:34,920
I'm going to leave and exit with my 
hands up rather than leaving,

3072
02:15:34,921 --> 02:15:37,890
exiting with my hands 100 percent and 
again,

3073
02:15:37,891 --> 02:15:42,891
the way I throw it and it I could still 
make it work in mma because one of the 

3074
02:15:43,231 --> 02:15:48,231
tricks that I teach my mma guys is 
instead of keeping that front arm 

3075
02:15:48,231 --> 02:15:52,101
pinned,
you keep it up here so if it covers the 

3076
02:15:52,101 --> 02:15:55,551
center so you're lifting your frontal 
lobe and so this way your elbow now 

3077
02:15:55,651 --> 02:15:57,860
covers the center line.
Right now.

3078
02:15:57,870 --> 02:16:00,780
It's harder for straight punches and 
you've got to think,

3079
02:16:00,781 --> 02:16:05,781
you gave me a straight punch and I put 
my elbow in front of the block and the 

3080
02:16:05,781 --> 02:16:09,201
center line,
if you punch your to knuckle under an 

3081
02:16:09,201 --> 02:16:11,450
mma glove on my elbow to your hand so 
you can really manipulate that front 

3082
02:16:11,881 --> 02:16:16,881
elbow to be able to kind of use that 
defense and kind of make a make it work.

3083
02:16:17,280 --> 02:16:19,170
But again,
I still believe in movement.

3084
02:16:19,800 --> 02:16:22,920
There's another issue in mma to his 
brick and hand breaking hands.

3085
02:16:23,110 --> 02:16:25,230
A lot of guys break cans,
those little gloves,

3086
02:16:25,260 --> 02:16:27,270
but when you did old school martial 
arts,

3087
02:16:27,570 --> 02:16:29,230
how did you train your hands?
Well,

3088
02:16:29,231 --> 02:16:30,880
you know,
there's a lot of guys.

3089
02:16:30,881 --> 02:16:34,150
My friend john was a nut about this.
My friend John Lee,

3090
02:16:34,151 --> 02:16:36,460
who was a us national taekwondo 
champion.

3091
02:16:36,461 --> 02:16:40,060
He used to punch bricks and he had one 
knuckle like his.

3092
02:16:40,120 --> 02:16:44,970
His two knuckles had forged into this 
one giant callous knuckle.

3093
02:16:44,971 --> 02:16:46,320
It can be seen those old like,
oh yeah,

3094
02:16:46,330 --> 02:16:51,330
that's so yama guys.
this old school one but you don't even 

3095
02:16:51,330 --> 02:16:52,570
not cool anymore.
But then.

3096
02:16:52,580 --> 02:16:55,300
But then I heard that shit super bad.
As you get older,

3097
02:16:55,360 --> 02:16:59,290
like massive arthritis and you can't 
write your own name anymore.

3098
02:16:59,680 --> 02:17:04,000
So I,
I played around with doing some bag work

3099
02:17:04,090 --> 02:17:05,170
with no gloves.

3100
02:17:05,860 --> 02:17:10,860
I keep my raps on sometimes.
Mostly Just avoid the scraping and the 

3101
02:17:10,860 --> 02:17:14,521
cutting,
but I'll hit the bags with with no 

3102
02:17:14,521 --> 02:17:15,310
gloves on and I'll literally hit my hand
on different angles.

3103
02:17:15,311 --> 02:17:20,311
For example,
I'll sit there and I hit the side aisle 

3104
02:17:20,311 --> 02:17:20,311
back,
fist it you need that,

3105
02:17:20,311 --> 02:17:22,350
that,
like I said earlier in the podcast,

3106
02:17:22,351 --> 02:17:27,351
you need to strengthen everything.
You need to strengthen all those little 

3107
02:17:27,351 --> 02:17:29,140
parts and that's why one of my last 
instagram videos I said add,

3108
02:17:29,320 --> 02:17:34,320
waited just a one pound or two pound 
dumbbell to your sHadow boxing because 

3109
02:17:34,901 --> 02:17:35,440
again,
you're,

3110
02:17:35,441 --> 02:17:37,300
you're,
you're working those little joints.

3111
02:17:37,301 --> 02:17:42,301
He might not necessarily work like if 
you have those dumbbells and you rotate 

3112
02:17:42,301 --> 02:17:45,541
your hands in a circle,
you're going to feel your elbow work at 

3113
02:17:45,541 --> 02:17:47,680
different movements and different ways 
that help strengthen the joint,

3114
02:17:47,681 --> 02:17:51,010
so those little minor things add up at 
the end,

3115
02:17:51,160 --> 02:17:51,760
I'm sure.

3116
02:17:51,880 --> 02:17:54,760
Did you ever squeeze your hand grippers 
or anything like that?

3117
02:17:54,790 --> 02:17:55,630
Not really,
no.

3118
02:17:56,060 --> 02:17:57,610
A lot of guys are into that too,
and I've.

3119
02:17:57,611 --> 02:18:01,660
I've gotten more into that lately.
There's this old school,

3120
02:18:01,870 --> 02:18:06,870
yeah,
there's a company called captains of 

3121
02:18:06,870 --> 02:18:08,401
crush.
They make ones that are like 197 pounds 

3122
02:18:08,401 --> 02:18:09,250
to squeeze that make them up to go even 
heavier than that,

3123
02:18:09,251 --> 02:18:12,100
but I have one at home that are 1:40,
one 60.

3124
02:18:12,340 --> 02:18:17,340
I keep my car and Just fucking you.
Especially for your jujitsu though.

3125
02:18:17,920 --> 02:18:19,870
That develops naturally.
Yes,

3126
02:18:19,871 --> 02:18:21,310
it does develop naturally,
but that's.

3127
02:18:21,340 --> 02:18:26,340
That accentuates it.
Definitely accentuates it and a hanging 

3128
02:18:26,340 --> 02:18:27,550
hanging from your hands like from a chin
up bar.

3129
02:18:27,580 --> 02:18:29,960
You know,
what might you do to get my gym?

3130
02:18:30,520 --> 02:18:32,020
Loves it.
He's like,

3131
02:18:32,021 --> 02:18:32,500
man,
he's like,

3132
02:18:32,501 --> 02:18:33,580
you got to hang.
And we're like,

3133
02:18:33,820 --> 02:18:38,820
get outta here.
He's literally hanging and it was like 

3134
02:18:38,820 --> 02:18:41,700
he says,
what it's done for his joints has been 

3135
02:18:41,700 --> 02:18:41,700
incredible.

3136
02:18:41,700 --> 02:18:41,930
Yeah.
That was a fish is.

3137
02:18:41,931 --> 02:18:43,150
Yeah,
that's what I'm saying.

3138
02:18:43,151 --> 02:18:48,151
That's another steve maxwell thing.
He brought up on this podcast about 

3139
02:18:48,151 --> 02:18:50,911
being able to a loose in the shoulders 
up and alleviate a lot of the 

3140
02:18:50,911 --> 02:18:51,850
impingements through hanging and people 
were interested in this.

3141
02:18:51,851 --> 02:18:52,630
They're listening.
They have,

3142
02:18:52,760 --> 02:18:56,830
if you Have a shoulder injury,
there's a bunch of videos of it online.

3143
02:18:56,880 --> 02:18:58,090
Have a while.
They explain it.

3144
02:18:58,390 --> 02:19:02,260
Another thing that I got into recently 
was a bottoms up kettle bells.

3145
02:19:02,680 --> 02:19:05,290
You know like this is a kettlebell here 
and when you.

3146
02:19:05,470 --> 02:19:07,870
Most of the time you hold a kettle bell,
you would hold it like this.

3147
02:19:09,070 --> 02:19:11,710
When you hold it the other way,
you hold it like this,

3148
02:19:11,770 --> 02:19:16,770
you really have to show that you're 
developing like real stability in your 

3149
02:19:16,770 --> 02:19:21,481
shoulders that you don't ordinarily.
It's more like a stability because it's 

3150
02:19:21,481 --> 02:19:23,450
not like it's hard to hold it up,
you know,

3151
02:19:23,460 --> 02:19:25,330
like it's not the weight itself.

3152
02:19:25,540 --> 02:19:30,540
Not that hard to lift because he's like,
this ironman kettlebell is only 40 

3153
02:19:30,540 --> 02:19:34,301
pounds.
I was actually talking about those 

3154
02:19:34,301 --> 02:19:34,301
today.
Dope,

3155
02:19:34,301 --> 02:19:34,820
right.
Whitney miller with glory now,

3156
02:19:34,821 --> 02:19:35,370
right?
Yes,

3157
02:19:35,371 --> 02:19:35,740
yes,
yes.

3158
02:19:35,741 --> 02:19:40,741
The backseat,
she was telling us about it and she was 

3159
02:19:40,741 --> 02:19:40,741
telling me she was,
you guys are friends.

3160
02:19:40,741 --> 02:19:41,990
I love these things,
but bottoms up.

3161
02:19:41,991 --> 02:19:43,460
Kettle bells doesn't have to be an iron 
man.

3162
02:19:43,461 --> 02:19:48,461
Any kind it will.
It's a very weird it how hard it is to 

3163
02:19:48,461 --> 02:19:53,021
bounce and in place and it's probably 
like some of those poses when you're on 

3164
02:19:53,021 --> 02:19:55,250
your ball of your foot.
Balancing on one leg.

3165
02:19:55,320 --> 02:19:57,950
Yeah.
the strongest bodybuilder in the world.

3166
02:19:58,100 --> 02:19:59,660
not a chance.
What?

3167
02:19:59,661 --> 02:20:04,661
I was shocked with how my feet would 
hurt when I first started getting into 

3168
02:20:04,661 --> 02:20:04,661
yoga.
I'm like,

3169
02:20:04,661 --> 02:20:05,390
oh,
my feet are fucking killing me.

3170
02:20:05,391 --> 02:20:08,090
Like when you do the standing bow pose,
my feet would be shaking.

3171
02:20:08,680 --> 02:20:10,070
I was like this.
It's so weird.

3172
02:20:10,071 --> 02:20:15,071
It's such a weird,
weird little muscles that you don't 

3173
02:20:15,071 --> 02:20:15,071
think you got to think.
Well god,

3174
02:20:15,071 --> 02:20:17,840
I've been kicking things forever.
I might have to be strong.

3175
02:20:18,950 --> 02:20:21,340
So back to that movement would do like 
that movements stuff.

3176
02:20:21,350 --> 02:20:26,350
yes I do.
And I don't because like where I was 

3177
02:20:26,350 --> 02:20:29,411
saying about yoga,
like I think you've made a really good 

3178
02:20:29,411 --> 02:20:31,931
point.
Like you can't do everything and that's 

3179
02:20:31,931 --> 02:20:31,931
probably wind up doing too much.
You want to.

3180
02:20:31,931 --> 02:20:35,720
Yeah.
But I think that there's something to 

3181
02:20:35,720 --> 02:20:38,950
the ability to move your body and it's 
one of the things that eddie bravo is 

3182
02:20:38,950 --> 02:20:42,670
brought up many times.
What we have seen over the last few 

3183
02:20:42,670 --> 02:20:47,110
years is a break dancers who have gotten
into mma or gotten into jujitsu rather.

3184
02:20:47,450 --> 02:20:49,850
And they're fucking phenomenal.
I mean to,

3185
02:20:49,900 --> 02:20:51,890
of edie's best students.
Uh,

3186
02:20:51,891 --> 02:20:55,520
Richard Martinez and geo martinez are 
fucking break dancers.

3187
02:20:55,790 --> 02:20:59,370
So these guys are ridiculously dexter 
there.

3188
02:20:59,380 --> 02:21:04,380
Their dexterity is ridiculous.
So they can stand on one hand and have 

3189
02:21:04,380 --> 02:21:06,320
the other hand up in the air and their 
feet are up and they spend,

3190
02:21:06,321 --> 02:21:11,321
they can spin on their head and 
unbelievable ability to move their 

3191
02:21:11,321 --> 02:21:14,621
bodies and that translates directly into
grappling and they learn so quick.

3192
02:21:15,260 --> 02:21:17,330
Like I had heard about these guys when 
they were just starting.

3193
02:21:17,570 --> 02:21:18,290
He's like,
dude,

3194
02:21:18,470 --> 02:21:23,470
these guys,
they've been doing jujitsu for three 

3195
02:21:23,470 --> 02:21:23,470
months.
They're fucking choke.

3196
02:21:23,470 --> 02:21:23,470
And everybody.
I'm like,

3197
02:21:23,470 --> 02:21:23,470
that's crazy.
It's like I'm telling you,

3198
02:21:23,470 --> 02:21:28,271
it's like just make sense.
They can move their body in a way that 

3199
02:21:28,271 --> 02:21:31,751
you can't move your body.
Then I think there's mobility and the 

3200
02:21:31,751 --> 02:21:32,420
ability to,
um,

3201
02:21:32,670 --> 02:21:36,140
to,
to effectively manipulate your body in a

3202
02:21:36,141 --> 02:21:39,650
way that's alien to other people I think
has significant advantages.

3203
02:21:39,651 --> 02:21:43,190
And I think that comes from what that 
ido portal guys doing.

3204
02:21:43,280 --> 02:21:48,280
And I think that comes from yoga.
I think that comes from a lot of these 

3205
02:21:48,280 --> 02:21:51,791
break dancers.
But it's a matter of like how much time 

3206
02:21:51,791 --> 02:21:53,360
do you spend doing that?
And is it something that you start doing

3207
02:21:53,361 --> 02:21:55,520
when you're 28,
when you're already professional fighter

3208
02:21:55,521 --> 02:22:00,521
as a world champion,
or is it something you need to do when 

3209
02:22:00,521 --> 02:22:02,951
you're 15 and you were a crazy kid 
fucking around in high school and you 

3210
02:22:02,951 --> 02:22:06,350
get really good at it and then you 
translate that ability to move your body

3211
02:22:06,351 --> 02:22:10,370
directly in this martial arts.
I looked noW as a 31 year old.

3212
02:22:10,730 --> 02:22:12,140
I look back now and I say,
well,

3213
02:22:12,141 --> 02:22:17,141
what would I have done if I knew I was 
going to end up as a professional 

3214
02:22:17,141 --> 02:22:17,141
fighter?
Well,

3215
02:22:17,141 --> 02:22:21,230
what I've done from a young age in order
for me to improve to where I was,

3216
02:22:21,680 --> 02:22:22,790
I want to hear your take on it.

3217
02:22:22,790 --> 02:22:24,800
So what would you do as a kid?
I'll give you an example.

3218
02:22:25,110 --> 02:22:30,110
One of my things,
I would've done gymnastics from a young 

3219
02:22:30,110 --> 02:22:30,110
age.
Great.

3220
02:22:30,110 --> 02:22:31,740
Great thing to say.
And my other ones are dancing.

3221
02:22:31,980 --> 02:22:33,120
It's great thing to.
Yeah,

3222
02:22:33,300 --> 02:22:38,300
that's a great thing.
That's why I think chris brown is gonna 

3223
02:22:38,300 --> 02:22:38,300
fuck up.
Soulja boy told you.

3224
02:22:38,300 --> 02:22:38,850
Yeah,
I think the ability to move your body.

3225
02:22:38,880 --> 02:22:40,620
You know what I mean?
The ability to move it really well,

3226
02:22:40,621 --> 02:22:43,560
I mean I noticed that going from 
taekwondo did jujitsu,

3227
02:22:43,561 --> 02:22:45,780
that I had great balance.
Transferable skills.

3228
02:22:45,781 --> 02:22:50,781
Yeah.
You're used to standing on one leg all 

3229
02:22:50,781 --> 02:22:52,971
the time,
so your ability to maintain that 

3230
02:22:52,971 --> 02:22:52,971
position as much better than someone 
who's not.

3231
02:22:52,971 --> 02:22:54,450
And I noticed that even translating 
directly into yoga,

3232
02:22:54,810 --> 02:22:58,200
but I think it depends on what kind of 
fighting you were trying to do.

3233
02:22:58,470 --> 02:23:03,470
Like if I wanted to get into mma,
one of the things that I tell people is 

3234
02:23:03,470 --> 02:23:05,970
that wrestling has probably the most 
important skill.

3235
02:23:06,180 --> 02:23:09,600
The ability to demonstrate the ability 
to dictate where the fight takes place.

3236
02:23:09,780 --> 02:23:14,780
I agree that was a gigantic key to the 
success of george st pierre and the 

3237
02:23:14,780 --> 02:23:18,531
success of many,
many fighters and also the success of 

3238
02:23:18,531 --> 02:23:19,230
many strikers is there defensive 
wrestling,

3239
02:23:19,231 --> 02:23:20,730
their ability to keep the fight 
standing.

3240
02:23:21,030 --> 02:23:26,030
So if you have the ability to take a guy
down and you have the ability to make 

3241
02:23:26,030 --> 02:23:30,201
sure he doesn't take you down,
then you can better dictate where the 

3242
02:23:30,201 --> 02:23:30,660
fight takes place.
So I think,

3243
02:23:30,870 --> 02:23:33,480
and I think it's also a skill that's 
really,

3244
02:23:34,130 --> 02:23:37,110
that translates so incredibly well when 
you learn it early in life,

3245
02:23:37,470 --> 02:23:42,470
but striking is the scariest shit and 
striking is also something that I think 

3246
02:23:44,551 --> 02:23:47,790
there's a diminished effectiveness and 
learning as you get older.

3247
02:23:48,390 --> 02:23:51,240
There's something about like,
I've seen people that didn't start doing

3248
02:23:51,241 --> 02:23:56,241
jujitsu until they're 30 and they 
develop and they do love black belt 

3249
02:23:56,241 --> 02:23:56,241
skills.

3250
02:23:56,241 --> 02:23:56,310
Russel peters,
by the way,

3251
02:23:56,400 --> 02:23:57,630
the rest of this grades.
He good.

3252
02:23:57,840 --> 02:24:01,020
Is he good at just starting.
Eats too much.

3253
02:24:01,021 --> 02:24:02,800
He drinks too much.
Is beautiful.

3254
02:24:02,801 --> 02:24:04,260
I saw that.
That's awesome.

3255
02:24:04,350 --> 02:24:05,370
Yeah man,
he's training.

3256
02:24:05,371 --> 02:24:07,250
We train,
he's a,

3257
02:24:07,310 --> 02:24:08,610
he,
he gets after a man,

3258
02:24:08,611 --> 02:24:10,590
he gets tired.
I love him.

3259
02:24:11,010 --> 02:24:13,050
I love that guy to death.
But he.

3260
02:24:13,740 --> 02:24:18,000
Back to the question about it.
It depends on what you would want to do.

3261
02:24:18,200 --> 02:24:22,110
So with a kick boxer saying striking,
I think.

3262
02:24:23,100 --> 02:24:28,100
I think footwork and movement.
I think the ability to get in and out.

3263
02:24:28,260 --> 02:24:33,260
You know like when you look at guys who 
are really good at not being there when 

3264
02:24:33,260 --> 02:24:37,740
they're their opponent attacks.
When you look at like the guys who have 

3265
02:24:37,740 --> 02:24:41,550
fantastic footwork and I think maybe if 
you want to be a striker,

3266
02:24:41,551 --> 02:24:44,750
I think really just working.
I think what you're saying about your,

3267
02:24:44,800 --> 02:24:47,280
your training regimen,
you would essentially,

3268
02:24:47,290 --> 02:24:49,020
you're not running around doing all 
these different things.

3269
02:24:49,020 --> 02:24:54,020
You're.
You're focusing entirely on what you 

3270
02:24:54,020 --> 02:24:54,570
will do in an actual fight.
So maybe you didn't do anything wrong.

3271
02:24:54,600 --> 02:24:55,920
Maybe you did it perfect.
That's it.

3272
02:24:55,980 --> 02:24:56,820
Who knows?
YeaH,

3273
02:24:57,120 --> 02:24:57,960
it works,
man.

3274
02:24:57,961 --> 02:24:59,370
I dunno.
I just think like you said,

3275
02:24:59,371 --> 02:25:01,470
people are doing way too much and that's
the problem.

3276
02:25:02,050 --> 02:25:02,970
yeah,
and they're not.

3277
02:25:04,140 --> 02:25:08,040
Things have to have a purpose,
like my strength training.

3278
02:25:08,070 --> 02:25:11,760
There's all these new tools and these 
new fun things like,

3279
02:25:11,761 --> 02:25:16,761
hey,
let's do this crazy exercise where I'm 

3280
02:25:16,761 --> 02:25:17,910
doing a dead lift into a squat,
into some shoulder press.

3281
02:25:18,150 --> 02:25:21,090
Why don't you deadlift,
do it really well,

3282
02:25:21,330 --> 02:25:24,370
and then why don't you squat,
do it well,

3283
02:25:24,400 --> 02:25:27,100
and then why don't you shoulder press 
and do it well in a safe,

3284
02:25:27,101 --> 02:25:28,140
proper manner.
There's.

3285
02:25:28,180 --> 02:25:33,180
It doesn't have to be over complicated 
and I think people are trying to 

3286
02:25:33,180 --> 02:25:36,181
overcomplicate and that's what kind of 
takes away from their success over 

3287
02:25:36,181 --> 02:25:40,441
complicating things.
And when do you also agree that it 

3288
02:25:40,441 --> 02:25:41,350
depends entirely upon the kind of body 
that a person was born with.

3289
02:25:41,370 --> 02:25:43,340
Like some genetics is huge.
Yeah,

3290
02:25:43,360 --> 02:25:47,860
it's giant and it's sort of like the 
inescapable factor.

3291
02:25:47,890 --> 02:25:50,260
If someone has genetic advantages,
you know,

3292
02:25:50,290 --> 02:25:51,430
they just,
they just,

3293
02:25:51,431 --> 02:25:56,431
when they even say like power hitting,
I don't know how you can teach someone 

3294
02:25:56,431 --> 02:26:00,391
to hit harder,
but there's just those naturally guys 

3295
02:26:00,391 --> 02:26:03,550
who can just knock you out from day one.
Just a natural hitting ability.

3296
02:26:03,551 --> 02:26:07,120
You can't teach someone to hit like 
George Foreman know it just,

3297
02:26:07,121 --> 02:26:12,121
it is what it is.
no matter how much you turn your 

3298
02:26:12,121 --> 02:26:12,121
shoulder and you put your hip into it,
you're not hitting them.

3299
02:26:12,121 --> 02:26:14,050
Isn't it crazy too that you can't tell 
by looking at someone?

3300
02:26:14,560 --> 02:26:19,560
Like tHere's some people you would look 
at them and they don't look like a big 

3301
02:26:19,560 --> 02:26:19,560
puncher,
but there were murderous.

3302
02:26:19,560 --> 02:26:20,290
yeah,
it's the,

3303
02:26:20,300 --> 02:26:22,120
you know what it is.
A lot of those tall guys,

3304
02:26:22,480 --> 02:26:25,420
they have that stiffness in that.
It's like a stiff power.

3305
02:26:25,421 --> 02:26:28,360
That's really tough.
Sometimes it's like a stiff power,

3306
02:26:28,361 --> 02:26:30,530
but it hurts.
What's a mechanical advantage?

3307
02:26:30,531 --> 02:26:35,531
You know,
all that leverage which also translate 

3308
02:26:35,531 --> 02:26:35,670
to jujitsu to giant advantage in 
jujitsu,

3309
02:26:35,680 --> 02:26:38,620
to have long limbs.
It's tough.

3310
02:26:38,621 --> 02:26:41,320
Like I like you back to the long point 
from before,

3311
02:26:41,321 --> 02:26:45,520
but I became my best as a martial artist
with color commentary.

3312
02:26:45,910 --> 02:26:48,820
You have to know everything.
You have to be able to.

3313
02:26:49,540 --> 02:26:54,540
You have to watch a fight and you have 
to be able to assess instantly what's 

3314
02:26:54,540 --> 02:26:55,660
going on,
how they're doing it.

3315
02:26:56,750 --> 02:26:58,990
You got to do it on the fly.
You don't have time,

3316
02:26:59,440 --> 02:27:01,570
right?
So you have to be able to pick things up

3317
02:27:01,571 --> 02:27:04,270
quickly and noW I'm at the point where I
can look at someone.

3318
02:27:04,271 --> 02:27:05,860
as soon as they get into their stance,
I'll be like,

3319
02:27:05,861 --> 02:27:06,820
okay,
you got to do this,

3320
02:27:06,821 --> 02:27:07,240
this,
this,

3321
02:27:07,241 --> 02:27:07,960
and this.
Well,

3322
02:27:07,961 --> 02:27:12,961
it's funny too,
when you can tell when a guy is gonna 

3323
02:27:12,961 --> 02:27:12,961
kick go,
here comes a right kick.

3324
02:27:12,961 --> 02:27:13,480
You just see it,
you see the back,

3325
02:27:13,481 --> 02:27:15,850
he'll come up,
you see them leaning a little bit,

3326
02:27:16,030 --> 02:27:21,030
or especially when the guy's got spin.
That's the big giveaway and I see that 

3327
02:27:21,030 --> 02:27:22,820
left hip turn a little steps that it's 
that bad.

3328
02:27:22,870 --> 02:27:23,560
Yeah,
you could see it.

3329
02:27:23,590 --> 02:27:25,140
You can see it.
How do you think?

3330
02:27:25,180 --> 02:27:28,560
Would you be a good coach?
If I was invested in it,

3331
02:27:28,650 --> 02:27:30,850
I would be the best coach that I could 
be for sure.

3332
02:27:30,950 --> 02:27:35,950
But do you think one of the reasons why 
I stoPped teaching when I started doing 

3333
02:27:35,950 --> 02:27:39,361
standup comedy because I wasn't being a 
very good teacher anymore just because 

3334
02:27:39,361 --> 02:27:39,361
he didn't put the time and the effort 
into it.

3335
02:27:39,361 --> 02:27:42,100
It wasn't where my head was at.
My head was now I was,

3336
02:27:42,550 --> 02:27:43,900
you know,
there was no,

3337
02:27:43,901 --> 02:27:45,610
like I said,
there was no money in fighting.

3338
02:27:45,760 --> 02:27:49,450
When I was fighting there was nothing.
And so unless you were a boxer,

3339
02:27:49,451 --> 02:27:51,910
you weren't gonna make any money.
So that was before fear factor?

3340
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:53,170
Yeah,
way before.

3341
02:27:53,350 --> 02:27:58,350
So there was essentially no way to have 
a career other than teaching.

3342
02:27:59,140 --> 02:28:00,970
And so when I started getting into 
standup comedy,

3343
02:28:00,971 --> 02:28:05,971
I realized like I got talked into it by 
guys I train with and when I started 

3344
02:28:05,971 --> 02:28:07,090
doing I realized like,
oh wow,

3345
02:28:07,091 --> 02:28:09,820
like I could make a living doing this.
Like this is actually,

3346
02:28:09,821 --> 02:28:14,821
there's a real path.
Like there's guys that I know that make 

3347
02:28:14,821 --> 02:28:17,311
a living doing this where everybody 
didn't know that's fighting is broke or 

3348
02:28:17,311 --> 02:28:20,071
they're slurring their words like guys 
from the gym that would be in gym wars 

3349
02:28:20,071 --> 02:28:20,071
all the time and now they're all fucked 
up.

3350
02:28:20,071 --> 02:28:21,650
They don't want to know where they 
parked their car.

3351
02:28:21,860 --> 02:28:22,010
There

3352
02:28:22,010 --> 02:28:24,350
was a lot of that shit that was scaring 
the fuck out of me.

3353
02:28:24,680 --> 02:28:29,680
So when I started getting into comedy,
I quit teaching and I suffered 

3354
02:28:30,201 --> 02:28:35,201
financially because of it.
But I would rather do that at the time 

3355
02:28:35,201 --> 02:28:38,200
my mind was I would rather suffer 
financially then give anybody a 

3356
02:28:38,200 --> 02:28:39,150
halfassed coaching job.
Yeah.

3357
02:28:39,910 --> 02:28:44,910
No.
So coaching mma I think is one of the 

3358
02:28:44,910 --> 02:28:46,860
most difficult things in all sports.
You know?

3359
02:28:46,970 --> 02:28:51,970
I bet.
I'm sure coach and kickboxing is 

3360
02:28:51,970 --> 02:28:54,131
probably very similar in that regard in 
that you're so invested in your 

3361
02:28:54,131 --> 02:28:54,131
students.
There's so much.

3362
02:28:54,510 --> 02:28:54,990
Yeah,
I mean,

3363
02:28:55,070 --> 02:28:56,900
and it's so you're,
you're,

3364
02:28:56,990 --> 02:28:58,790
you know,
there's nothing you can do.

3365
02:28:58,820 --> 02:29:02,420
You can train them as much as you can,
but you got to let them go when they get

3366
02:29:02,421 --> 02:29:04,230
into that ring or get into that cage and
like,

3367
02:29:04,700 --> 02:29:07,340
you know and hope that it all comes 
together.

3368
02:29:07,340 --> 02:29:12,080
But the other problem I find with mma is
that a lot of coaches,

3369
02:29:12,081 --> 02:29:16,250
there's too many coaches.
I find you have a lot of these guys have

3370
02:29:16,251 --> 02:29:19,220
a boxing coach that's telling him to box
a certain way.

3371
02:29:19,550 --> 02:29:20,900
Then all of a sudden they're going,
hey,

3372
02:29:20,901 --> 02:29:23,250
I got to do more now.
So they have a moy coach,

3373
02:29:23,251 --> 02:29:26,000
coaches now telling them to do more tie 
this way.

3374
02:29:26,190 --> 02:29:27,260
Then all of a sudden,
hey,

3375
02:29:27,261 --> 02:29:30,140
we got to do spinning shit,
so let's deal with here.

3376
02:29:30,380 --> 02:29:35,380
So now all of a sudden you have three 
different coaches all telling you to do 

3377
02:29:35,380 --> 02:29:35,380
different things.
Yeah.

3378
02:29:35,380 --> 02:29:37,340
So now this poor fighter is going to go 
to the ring.

3379
02:29:37,341 --> 02:29:38,570
Yeah.
You might not know.

3380
02:29:38,600 --> 02:29:40,520
You might know everything,
but I'm all of them,

3381
02:29:40,550 --> 02:29:43,100
but what are you going to do?
You're going to get confused.

3382
02:29:43,340 --> 02:29:44,210
That's where,
again,

3383
02:29:44,240 --> 02:29:49,240
basics are important.
That's why I don't think you should 

3384
02:29:49,240 --> 02:29:50,570
overcomplicate shit,
so I know if you're going to jab,

3385
02:29:50,600 --> 02:29:51,560
I know how I'm going to do it.

3386
02:29:51,560 --> 02:29:53,180
I'm not.
I don't have time to sit and be like,

3387
02:29:53,181 --> 02:29:54,350
okay,
I know I compare it.

3388
02:29:54,351 --> 02:29:56,900
I know I can slip.
I know I can time with the local.

3389
02:29:56,930 --> 02:30:00,290
You have to know and I think with too 
many,

3390
02:30:01,070 --> 02:30:06,070
too many coaches are complicating shit 
for these guys where they think they 

3391
02:30:06,831 --> 02:30:11,831
have to hit all of these things,
so they're going all these different 

3392
02:30:11,831 --> 02:30:13,800
coaches and it's way over complicated,
so who do you listen to?

3393
02:30:13,820 --> 02:30:15,800
How do you listen to which way's the 
right way?

3394
02:30:15,801 --> 02:30:19,400
Which ones are wrong with my boxing 
coach is telling me to turn my heel out.

3395
02:30:19,460 --> 02:30:22,610
My kickboxing coach is telling me to 
keep my front foot pointing forward,

3396
02:30:22,760 --> 02:30:27,760
which is the right way.
It's a good point and I think that's 

3397
02:30:27,760 --> 02:30:28,790
where guys like matt hume,
guys like for us a hobby.

3398
02:30:29,030 --> 02:30:34,030
That's why they're so important to.
Because their overall mma coaches and 

3399
02:30:34,030 --> 02:30:38,441
also I think what's really important 
about guys like matt and for us is that 

3400
02:30:38,441 --> 02:30:41,621
both of those guys are highly 
accomplished martial artists in all 

3401
02:30:41,621 --> 02:30:45,011
disciplines,
so they really know how to put it all 

3402
02:30:45,011 --> 02:30:47,261
together like us,
a black belt in jujitsu and outstanding 

3403
02:30:47,261 --> 02:30:50,291
striker,
so he knows how to combine all those 

3404
02:30:50,291 --> 02:30:50,291
things together.

3405
02:30:50,291 --> 02:30:51,560
That's so critical.
And it was probablY the same way.

3406
02:30:52,250 --> 02:30:53,810
Yeah.
I mean there's,

3407
02:30:53,840 --> 02:30:58,840
there's maybe a dozen of them on the 
planet and that's a problem if you're 

3408
02:30:58,840 --> 02:31:01,700
not near any of those and you start out 
with someone and then that coach becomes

3409
02:31:01,701 --> 02:31:03,440
like a mentor figure to you and then you
realize,

3410
02:31:03,441 --> 02:31:08,441
oh,
my coach is kind of limited in a lot of 

3411
02:31:08,441 --> 02:31:11,441
ways.
It's very difficult to separate 

3412
02:31:11,441 --> 02:31:11,441
yourself.
It's hard to see that.

3413
02:31:11,441 --> 02:31:11,441
Yes.
And it's kind of,

3414
02:31:11,441 --> 02:31:15,730
you can't be a fighter who you put all 
your trust into this man to help you 

3415
02:31:15,730 --> 02:31:16,070
out.
Then all of a sudden you're like,

3416
02:31:16,071 --> 02:31:17,090
oh,
he's lacking thing.

3417
02:31:17,810 --> 02:31:20,430
Like I remember with,
uh,

3418
02:31:20,460 --> 02:31:22,830
with mitch gagnon,
he came to me and he was like,

3419
02:31:23,010 --> 02:31:26,220
he had a guy working with them all the 
time and I was just kinda like,

3420
02:31:26,670 --> 02:31:28,520
I go to um,
uh,

3421
02:31:28,590 --> 02:31:30,580
his friend who asked me to help him with
his striking was like,

3422
02:31:31,520 --> 02:31:32,730
I don't know if I can help this guy.

3423
02:31:32,730 --> 02:31:36,510
He's just so bad technically at this 
point where I'm like,

3424
02:31:36,511 --> 02:31:39,960
it's a lot of work I have to do to,
to kind of fix and clean things up.

3425
02:31:39,961 --> 02:31:44,550
And that's my way.
But he was so good at just being a beast

3426
02:31:44,551 --> 02:31:49,551
and not caring that he was successful.
But when I showed him my way of putting 

3427
02:31:49,551 --> 02:31:49,551
things,
he's like,

3428
02:31:49,560 --> 02:31:51,960
ugh,
I wish I learned this earlier.

3429
02:31:51,961 --> 02:31:53,370
you know,
I wish I had this.

3430
02:31:53,371 --> 02:31:58,371
And then there was kind of,
sometimes you can kind of get angry 

3431
02:31:58,371 --> 02:32:00,921
about them.
And my why did I waste like so many 

3432
02:32:00,921 --> 02:32:03,081
years with this guy,
if this is the way it should've been 

3433
02:32:03,081 --> 02:32:03,081
done from the beginning.
Yeah.

3434
02:32:03,081 --> 02:32:07,311
I mean,
obviously people are limited 

3435
02:32:07,311 --> 02:32:07,311
geographically as far as like having a 
good coach near them.

3436
02:32:07,311 --> 02:32:11,751
But I urge anybody listening to this to 
put the research in before you join a 

3437
02:32:11,751 --> 02:32:14,220
gym,
it's so much harder to unlearn something

3438
02:32:14,221 --> 02:32:15,090
than it is to learn it.

3439
02:32:15,510 --> 02:32:17,610
So when you have.
Like one of the things that I would deal

3440
02:32:17,611 --> 02:32:21,570
with in teaching taekwondo is guys who 
came from other martial arts that didn't

3441
02:32:21,571 --> 02:32:24,430
know how to do certain things correctly,
like they,

3442
02:32:24,431 --> 02:32:27,990
their knees would be down.
They didn't lift the knee above the hip.

3443
02:32:27,991 --> 02:32:31,380
They didn't get real power in anything.
They never worked with a kicking bag.

3444
02:32:31,680 --> 02:32:34,980
They never worked with a heavy bag.
They'd just done stuff in the air and so

3445
02:32:34,981 --> 02:32:38,340
they didn't have any power.
And so you'd have to try to reteach them

3446
02:32:38,341 --> 02:32:40,410
and like they did when they would get 
tired,

3447
02:32:40,680 --> 02:32:42,000
it'd be the same thing,
foot up,

3448
02:32:42,030 --> 02:32:43,710
knee down,
everything be all screwed up.

3449
02:32:43,711 --> 02:32:44,090
And you're like,
no,

3450
02:32:44,091 --> 02:32:44,230
no,
no,

3451
02:32:44,231 --> 02:32:44,970
no.
you got to go.

3452
02:32:44,971 --> 02:32:49,971
Even when you're tired,
you've got to stick to the proper 

3453
02:32:49,971 --> 02:32:52,281
technique.
And then you would fall into what you 

3454
02:32:52,281 --> 02:32:52,281
learned first.
Yeah,

3455
02:32:52,281 --> 02:32:52,281
it's tough.

3456
02:32:52,281 --> 02:32:52,770
yeah,
it's tough.

3457
02:32:52,771 --> 02:32:56,400
And you always want to trust that Person
because you can't.

3458
02:32:56,401 --> 02:32:58,860
You have to.
And that's a lot of the fighters.

3459
02:32:59,380 --> 02:33:01,650
Um,
confidence comes from their coach.

3460
02:33:01,890 --> 02:33:02,940
yeah.
So you have to,

3461
02:33:02,941 --> 02:33:04,950
but it's kind of hard.
It's very hard.

3462
02:33:04,951 --> 02:33:07,500
It's hard to find that balance and it's 
also,

3463
02:33:07,501 --> 02:33:09,930
you have to have a relationship with 
that coach where you like them.

3464
02:33:10,040 --> 02:33:10,900
Yeah,
that's,

3465
02:33:10,901 --> 02:33:13,800
that's hard too.
So if you were to have an mma fight,

3466
02:33:13,801 --> 02:33:15,600
where would you go?
Man?

3467
02:33:16,080 --> 02:33:17,550
Is that putting you on the spot?
No,

3468
02:33:17,610 --> 02:33:19,500
but I think those guys that you talked 
about,

3469
02:33:21,010 --> 02:33:24,300
matt hume,
those two guys are in my opinion,

3470
02:33:24,330 --> 02:33:25,590
like cream of the crop,
duke,

3471
02:33:25,860 --> 02:33:26,640
duke,
roufus,

3472
02:33:27,240 --> 02:33:32,240
you know,
I think you'd have to have someone also 

3473
02:33:32,240 --> 02:33:32,460
that sees what you do well and says,
well,

3474
02:33:32,461 --> 02:33:35,250
this is obviously your primary base.
You're really good at this.

3475
02:33:35,280 --> 02:33:40,280
So let's,
let's work on all these other aspects 

3476
02:33:40,280 --> 02:33:40,280
too,
but this,

3477
02:33:40,280 --> 02:33:43,610
we're not going to try and take this 
away from you and turn you into a 

3478
02:33:43,610 --> 02:33:43,610
wrestler,
you know,

3479
02:33:43,610 --> 02:33:43,710
then you're going to fight a real,
real fucked up.

3480
02:33:43,800 --> 02:33:44,860
Yeah.
It's,

3481
02:33:45,290 --> 02:33:46,010
I mean,
and it's,

3482
02:33:46,011 --> 02:33:50,700
it's such a creative approach because 
you're creating a fighter.

3483
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:56,000
When you take someone and you're,
you're putting all the tools together 

3484
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:56,430
and you're helping them,
helping mold them,

3485
02:33:56,700 --> 02:34:01,700
but then it's also up to them too.
It's up to them to be improvisational 

3486
02:34:01,700 --> 02:34:06,231
inside the ring or the octagon and to 
figure out how to put those things 

3487
02:34:06,231 --> 02:34:08,100
together and everyone's got their own 
little style or own their own approach,

3488
02:34:08,130 --> 02:34:09,510
you know,
and again,

3489
02:34:09,511 --> 02:34:14,511
a lot of the differences like I mean 
just because I do something differently 

3490
02:34:14,581 --> 02:34:17,200
than someone else doesn't necessarily 
mean they're way is the wrong way.

3491
02:34:17,210 --> 02:34:17,980
Right?
Right.

3492
02:34:18,010 --> 02:34:21,940
Of course I'm going to believe my system
is the best system in the way,

3493
02:34:21,941 --> 02:34:26,890
but it's not to say it's the only way 
now there is no only way and that's what

3494
02:34:26,891 --> 02:34:31,891
I love,
but you have to be open to know that 

3495
02:34:31,891 --> 02:34:34,561
there's other ways.
And that's where I've been touching 

3496
02:34:34,561 --> 02:34:34,840
around on the.
Have you read the book of five rings?

3497
02:34:34,870 --> 02:34:37,060
Yes.
And he talks about you have to know your

3498
02:34:37,061 --> 02:34:42,061
weaknesses,
you have to know other arts in order to 

3499
02:34:42,061 --> 02:34:42,280
make your art and style the best.
That's musashi.

3500
02:34:42,680 --> 02:34:45,310
That's my tattoo.
I've been reading it.

3501
02:34:45,370 --> 02:34:48,610
I could only read one page at a time 
because I'm like,

3502
02:34:48,640 --> 02:34:49,510
shit,
I got to sit there,

3503
02:34:49,511 --> 02:34:51,590
I got to reflect on it.
And uh,

3504
02:34:51,610 --> 02:34:53,710
he was a deep dude.
I mean he killed 60 people.

3505
02:34:53,711 --> 02:34:57,350
It's one on one combat me and multiple 
musashi,

3506
02:34:57,410 --> 02:34:58,600
one of the greatest samurais ever.

3507
02:34:58,600 --> 02:35:00,960
And during a weird phase in history,
you know,

3508
02:35:00,970 --> 02:35:05,970
he was a ronan traveling around just 
getting in sword fights crazy and doing 

3509
02:35:06,071 --> 02:35:11,071
calligraphy and art.
He opened my mind to this idea that you 

3510
02:35:11,071 --> 02:35:13,030
have to be balanced in order to be 
effective in combat.

3511
02:35:13,031 --> 02:35:14,830
You can't have any holes in your mental 
game.

3512
02:35:14,831 --> 02:35:19,831
And one of the ways to not have holes in
the mental game was that he would 

3513
02:35:19,831 --> 02:35:22,150
approach everything as like art,
everything you did,

3514
02:35:22,151 --> 02:35:24,970
whether you were writing your name,
whether you were a,

3515
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:26,440
you know,
filling out a form,

3516
02:35:26,441 --> 02:35:27,600
driving your car.
Oh no,

3517
02:35:27,730 --> 02:35:30,670
no cars back then obviously.
But everything that you did,

3518
02:35:30,671 --> 02:35:33,060
you would do with excellence.
Yeah.

3519
02:35:33,650 --> 02:35:34,930
It was a bad motherfucker.
oh,

3520
02:35:34,931 --> 02:35:36,350
for sure.
I love it.

3521
02:35:36,380 --> 02:35:41,380
And it gets deep and talk about it and 
you look at it and you can look at 

3522
02:35:41,380 --> 02:35:41,500
yourself sometimes and be like,
yeah man,

3523
02:35:41,501 --> 02:35:43,810
I'm the modern day of some of the 
stories he does.

3524
02:35:43,810 --> 02:35:46,240
Like I did that in a different way,
you know?

3525
02:35:46,241 --> 02:35:48,580
And I think that's really cool for me to
see and read.

3526
02:35:48,850 --> 02:35:50,200
Yeah.
Because it translates,

3527
02:35:50,201 --> 02:35:55,201
you know,
this guy lived that life and then it's 

3528
02:35:55,201 --> 02:35:55,201
just a different time.
Yeah.

3529
02:35:55,240 --> 02:35:59,710
And then sat down and try to relay the 
information that he had accumulated over

3530
02:35:59,711 --> 02:36:04,711
this life of fucking people up at sorts.
I have a random question I'd asked you 

3531
02:36:04,711 --> 02:36:06,120
to fighting.
True or false.

3532
02:36:06,160 --> 02:36:08,830
Was it a real story that you wanted to 
fight wesley snipes?

3533
02:36:09,310 --> 02:36:11,660
It wasn't my idea.
It was a.

3534
02:36:11,760 --> 02:36:13,150
Because I always wanted to know about 
that.

3535
02:36:13,151 --> 02:36:14,320
Yeah.
That was ever a story.

3536
02:36:14,350 --> 02:36:15,910
One of the original producers of the 
ufc,

3537
02:36:15,911 --> 02:36:17,680
campbell mclaren,
who's a buddy of mine.

3538
02:36:17,870 --> 02:36:20,000
Yeah.
I did a reality show with them.

3539
02:36:20,010 --> 02:36:22,330
What was it?
I did a combat this America.

3540
02:36:22,760 --> 02:36:25,060
I was a guest star.
I was a guest coach on it.

3541
02:36:25,180 --> 02:36:26,620
Well,
they're still doing that show.

3542
02:36:26,621 --> 02:36:28,100
They're still having fights,
you know,

3543
02:36:28,510 --> 02:36:33,510
he's still putting on fires.
It was cool because one of the guys 

3544
02:36:33,510 --> 02:36:33,510
that,
uh,

3545
02:36:33,510 --> 02:36:34,570
it was like a guest kickboxing coach on 
the shell,

3546
02:36:34,790 --> 02:36:36,250
uh,
now fights with glory.

3547
02:36:36,280 --> 02:36:37,900
Daniel Morales.
Yeah.

3548
02:36:37,901 --> 02:36:38,920
Wow.
that's awesome.

3549
02:36:38,921 --> 02:36:43,921
Man was cool experience.
So he came to me with the idea because 

3550
02:36:43,921 --> 02:36:44,530
wesley snipes had tax problems.
That's what it was about.

3551
02:36:44,560 --> 02:36:45,550
So yeah,
we're going to deal with.

3552
02:36:45,551 --> 02:36:48,510
If I was gonna yeah,
would it have been a ufc sanctioned?

3553
02:36:48,870 --> 02:36:51,460
Yeah,
that would have been interesting.

3554
02:36:51,880 --> 02:36:53,410
Who knows,
you know,

3555
02:36:53,710 --> 02:36:55,690
that's why I asked earlier was like she 
didn't ask him or not.

3556
02:36:55,691 --> 02:36:56,420
I'm like,
I got to ask.

3557
02:36:56,440 --> 02:36:57,910
Well,
he had a martial arts background.

3558
02:36:58,540 --> 02:37:00,240
I know he did a lot of karate and you 
know,

3559
02:37:00,280 --> 02:37:02,050
I know he was a,
a good kicker.

3560
02:37:02,051 --> 02:37:07,051
Like you could tell like when you throw 
punches and kicks and he knew how to 

3561
02:37:07,051 --> 02:37:07,051
execute techniques but he'd never 
fought,

3562
02:37:07,570 --> 02:37:09,820
you know,
and he had no jujitsu at all.

3563
02:37:10,240 --> 02:37:11,560
Zero.
And I was like,

3564
02:37:11,561 --> 02:37:12,550
well,
good luck.

3565
02:37:12,680 --> 02:37:14,530
Was he,
was he thinking about taking it?

3566
02:37:14,620 --> 02:37:15,980
He just,
it where we were.

3567
02:37:15,981 --> 02:37:20,981
We had lawYers,
we had signed contracts or we had 

3568
02:37:20,981 --> 02:37:23,940
negotiated contracts.
Aren't you an unlockable character on 

3569
02:37:23,940 --> 02:37:23,940
the ufc game?
Lockable.

3570
02:37:23,940 --> 02:37:24,790
Lockable,
yeah.

3571
02:37:26,360 --> 02:37:28,970
Unlockable would say wrong.
Yeah.

3572
02:37:28,971 --> 02:37:29,940
You can unlock me.
Yeah,

3573
02:37:29,941 --> 02:37:30,770
yeah,
yeah,

3574
02:37:30,860 --> 02:37:31,790
yeah.
It's character.

3575
02:37:31,791 --> 02:37:36,791
I don't know.
It's weird that you have to do some 

3576
02:37:36,791 --> 02:37:36,791
weird fucking thing to do it.
You have to do that.

3577
02:37:36,791 --> 02:37:37,040
What is it called?
Konami code.

3578
02:37:37,060 --> 02:37:40,550
It's like a well known code in order to 
get you on the game.

3579
02:37:40,551 --> 02:37:42,500
YeAh.
You could do that and you can unlock me.

3580
02:37:43,180 --> 02:37:45,500
Know,
do you fight as you know,

3581
02:37:45,501 --> 02:37:46,970
I don't.
I don't play video games.

3582
02:37:47,590 --> 02:37:51,290
I have a problem with my brain.
I can't get involved in games.

3583
02:37:51,750 --> 02:37:53,290
I get better.
Yeah.

3584
02:37:53,440 --> 02:37:58,440
I'm a,
I have an addictive personality and I 

3585
02:37:58,440 --> 02:38:00,281
try to avoid all things that are 
negative or waste time that can be 

3586
02:38:00,281 --> 02:38:01,450
addictive,
you know?

3587
02:38:01,730 --> 02:38:02,240
You know?
Yeah.

3588
02:38:02,241 --> 02:38:03,650
It's crazy.
You have to know that.

3589
02:38:03,920 --> 02:38:06,140
You know what's crazy too,
like I've worked at,

3590
02:38:06,660 --> 02:38:11,420
because I worked with kids with special 
needs and I work a lot with autism and I

3591
02:38:11,421 --> 02:38:12,890
realized and I was like,
man,

3592
02:38:13,010 --> 02:38:18,010
these kids like just so obsessed with 
certain things in routine and then I 

3593
02:38:18,010 --> 02:38:22,391
started looking at other people in my 
life and think maybe we all have that 

3594
02:38:22,391 --> 02:38:22,910
little bit of that autistic traits in 
us.

3595
02:38:22,911 --> 02:38:24,590
you know,
like you have to be obsessed.

3596
02:38:24,591 --> 02:38:27,290
For me to be a world champion,
I have to be obsessed with training.

3597
02:38:27,740 --> 02:38:30,050
You can't just do it and be okay.
Like as these,

3598
02:38:31,360 --> 02:38:33,320
you know,
people living with autism,

3599
02:38:33,321 --> 02:38:35,690
they're just so obsessed with that one 
thing.

3600
02:38:35,691 --> 02:38:40,691
Like I have students who are so obsessed
with like the train system and then all 

3601
02:38:40,691 --> 02:38:41,030
of a sudden they can't think of anything
else,

3602
02:38:41,031 --> 02:38:46,031
but the train system you can try and 
they'll tell you anywhere how to get in 

3603
02:38:46,031 --> 02:38:46,100
toronto.

3604
02:38:46,100 --> 02:38:51,100
They'll tell you which bus,
which way the most intelligent people 

3605
02:38:51,100 --> 02:38:52,280
you've ever met.
But if you ask them a simple question,

3606
02:38:52,370 --> 02:38:54,080
they won't know it because they just 
don't care.

3607
02:38:54,081 --> 02:38:59,081
They're mind is so focused on one thing 
and autism is just beautiful and crazy 

3608
02:38:59,081 --> 02:39:01,280
at the same time.
I think it's beautiful to see someone so

3609
02:39:01,281 --> 02:39:04,610
obsessed and not caring about other 
things and what they're focused on.

3610
02:39:04,710 --> 02:39:06,830
It doesn't work well in society 
obviously,

3611
02:39:06,831 --> 02:39:09,740
but there are so absorbed in it and I 
think back and I was like,

3612
02:39:09,741 --> 02:39:14,741
man,
a lot of us have these personalities to 

3613
02:39:14,741 --> 02:39:14,900
be able to be so obsessed and so 
routine.

3614
02:39:14,901 --> 02:39:18,380
Like these guys,
these individuals with autism have to do

3615
02:39:18,381 --> 02:39:20,750
everything in a particular way.
Certain time,

3616
02:39:20,751 --> 02:39:24,350
a little bit of ocd in there.
I think to be successful and things,

3617
02:39:24,351 --> 02:39:26,360
you kind of have to have that little bit
of personality.

3618
02:39:26,570 --> 02:39:31,570
Yeah,
and they can make incredible progress 

3619
02:39:31,570 --> 02:39:33,200
and that's one of the things that a lot 
of those people are recruited by silicon

3620
02:39:33,201 --> 02:39:38,201
valley companies like specifically 
recruited because they know that they 

3621
02:39:38,201 --> 02:39:41,741
can achieve some incredible feats of 
success.

3622
02:39:43,100 --> 02:39:43,640
I have.
I,

3623
02:39:43,700 --> 02:39:46,820
I have a student at my school that 
probably knows ufc more than you.

3624
02:39:47,490 --> 02:39:49,220
Like he's literally.
It's crazy.

3625
02:39:49,790 --> 02:39:50,810
Everything.
Wow.

3626
02:39:50,840 --> 02:39:52,310
Every fighter,
every name,

3627
02:39:52,311 --> 02:39:54,260
where they're from,
what they do,

3628
02:39:54,261 --> 02:39:55,460
what they're,
you name it,

3629
02:39:55,461 --> 02:39:57,470
he knows it.
Any fighter,

3630
02:39:57,560 --> 02:40:01,700
any fighter you can ask him from one.
I had a guy talked to me about this once

3631
02:40:01,701 --> 02:40:06,701
and he argued that it's potentially,
it's an evolutionary trait and what 

3632
02:40:06,701 --> 02:40:07,370
we're watching is the next level of 
human intelligence.

3633
02:40:07,371 --> 02:40:12,371
We're seeing it and like blips and leaps
and a non reliance on emotion and that 

3634
02:40:13,670 --> 02:40:14,340
is also,

3635
02:40:14,400 --> 02:40:16,920
he believes that this is,
that,

3636
02:40:16,940 --> 02:40:21,940
you know,
human beings are interacting more with 

3637
02:40:21,940 --> 02:40:23,991
computers and ever before and they're 
interacting less with people and a lot 

3638
02:40:23,991 --> 02:40:27,741
of circumstances and he thinks that what
you're seeing is this eventual 

3639
02:40:27,741 --> 02:40:31,230
transition between humans now and humans
of the future.

3640
02:40:31,720 --> 02:40:34,790
It's things have changed.
No stripping.

3641
