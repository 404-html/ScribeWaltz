1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:05,280
Every day life.
Four,

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:06,240
three,
two,

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:07,103
one five.
And we're here with the Arnold 

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,390
Schwarzenegger of competence.
Mary Lynn Rice Cup.

5
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:12,623
When,
how many people have ever on one shot 

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,430
spelled your name right or pronounced it
right.

7
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:18,960
Hey,
never,

8
00:00:18,961 --> 00:00:19,591
never,
never.

9
00:00:19,591 --> 00:00:20,424
Right.
Like if you're at the DMV now that you 

10
00:00:21,151 --> 00:00:23,370
mentioned it because they're going to 
introduce me and it's just,

11
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,130
uh,
it just gives like an instant obstacle.

12
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:31,390
Like when you were coming up as a comic,
that had to be a big issue for the MC to

13
00:00:32,521 --> 00:00:33,770
bring you up or the,
the,

14
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,800
the Dj when they bring you up as you 
were the MC or the DJ or the MC.

15
00:00:39,001 --> 00:00:40,950
I don't know.
I never really looked at it that way.

16
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,950
Well,
somebody had an inner introduce you.

17
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:43,853
Yeah.
Right.

18
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,110
Like I think I was in such a,
uh,

19
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:50,640
a bubble.
I didn't really,

20
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,220
and I wasn't on the road hardcore and I 
wasn't,

21
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:54,180
I don't know.

22
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:59,180
I wasn't identifying with me as a 
performer so much.

23
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:00,563
What does that mean?
That means I was doing performance art 

24
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,500
and people were laughing.
I didn't know why they were laughing.

25
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,320
Right.
I moved to La.

26
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:10,891
I was like,
yeah,

27
00:01:10,891 --> 00:01:13,140
let's do shows.
Like I didn't know,

28
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,950
I didn't think about it as like you're 
introducing me.

29
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:18,300
I'm a,
I'm a performer.

30
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:22,350
I would say only in the past couple of 
years if I'd done the road proper.

31
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,350
But I came in the back alley for 
everything,

32
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:26,700
for comedy,
for,

33
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,120
for acting.
Like if I had come to la with a stack of

34
00:01:30,121 --> 00:01:30,960
head shots,
like,

35
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,190
Hey,
I'm ready for acting.

36
00:01:32,191 --> 00:01:35,760
It would've never happened.
I just came with a group of people like,

37
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,470
Oh to do some live shows and like no 
business being in La,

38
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:44,010
no business,
just doing weird shows cause that that's

39
00:01:44,011 --> 00:01:44,844
what I was compelled to do.
Like I could not have done it had I 

40
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,490
said,
all right,

41
00:01:50,491 --> 00:01:52,800
you're going to do acting and 
performing.

42
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,760
Especially not comedy.
Like I didn't identify with that at all.

43
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,400
I had to figure out why people were 
laughing.

44
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:00,803
That's fascinating.
So when you first got into show 

45
00:02:02,641 --> 00:02:04,590
business,
what was the goal?

46
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:08,550
It's a weird bird show business,
isn't she?

47
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,340
Isn't she a special lady?
I'm,

48
00:02:10,341 --> 00:02:11,174
I'm audition ready today by the way.
You notice I have a good brow in a good 

49
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,680
eye shadow line.
I'm such a woman.

50
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:23,460
I'm really more of a woman now than I've
ever been.

51
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,810
What's sad about what's that about?
Just growing up,

52
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,160
letting it go,
letting it go.

53
00:02:29,161 --> 00:02:30,720
And I look back in my twenties and I'm 
like,

54
00:02:30,721 --> 00:02:35,070
you were up hot bitch.
Like what was wrong with you?

55
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:39,720
But I was so incapable of anything like 
so socially.

56
00:02:39,721 --> 00:02:41,310
I mean I still am,
but I'm much,

57
00:02:41,311 --> 00:02:43,620
much better now.
But it's awkward,

58
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,880
awkward and just,
but that's um,

59
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,180
I don't find you awkward.
So it's odd.

60
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,680
Like every time I've talked to you,
we've had very fun,

61
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:55,410
comfortable conversations.
I never found it to be awkward.

62
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,423
I don't find you to be awkward either.
Maybe we just don't make each other 

63
00:02:58,900 --> 00:02:59,733
awkward.

64
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:05,710
Is that weird?
My mind just went to an instagram APP.

65
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:08,860
Ah,
that was creep tastic in my own mind.

66
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,700
That one that goes in close and it does 
the little stars.

67
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,040
Sorry.
It's all right.

68
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:16,060
Honestly,
don't find you to be awkward.

69
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,190
Every time I've ever talked to you,
it's been very,

70
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,170
very comfortable.
Very easy.

71
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:21,843
I agree.
But I would also say that's kind of a 

72
00:03:23,231 --> 00:03:24,064
recent development that you and I are 
speaking was when I started coming back 

73
00:03:29,321 --> 00:03:31,210
to the comedy store,
which was what,

74
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,850
a couple of years ago?
Yeah,

75
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,410
three now I guess.
Three something.

76
00:03:35,411 --> 00:03:40,411
14 November of 14 I think it was because
we've been in each other's orbit since,

77
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,480
you know,
since news radio.

78
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:44,693
Yeah.
But we didn't really get a chance to 

79
00:03:45,581 --> 00:03:46,414
like,
yeah,

80
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,270
hang out or be friends til the store.
You know?

81
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,980
That's such an interesting little 
community.

82
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:52,800
Right.
It's like everybody just kinda like,

83
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:55,840
like what I'm talking about a positive 
community.

84
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:56,783
Like I was just explaining,
explaining this to someone the other 

85
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:00,190
day.
Like when I first started going there in

86
00:04:00,191 --> 00:04:03,010
1994 there was a lot of conflict between
comedians.

87
00:04:03,011 --> 00:04:04,780
There's like comedians.
It didn't like comedians.

88
00:04:04,781 --> 00:04:05,620
Like,
Oh,

89
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:09,310
this guy doesn't like this guy and she 
doesn't like her and they all fucking,

90
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:10,653
yeah.
Duked it out with each other a little 

91
00:04:11,441 --> 00:04:13,390
bit.
There's none of that now.

92
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,583
Yeah.
It think about it's amazing quarter of 

93
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,140
that places.
It's amazing.

94
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,090
Like everybody's friendly.
Yeah.

95
00:04:19,091 --> 00:04:20,230
I love it.
Like,

96
00:04:20,231 --> 00:04:23,320
there might be a hundred of us there on 
a regular basis,

97
00:04:23,321 --> 00:04:25,900
like in and out doing Sunday through 
Monday.

98
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,790
Yeah.
And there's no conflicts.

99
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,000
It's really fucking cool.
Um,

100
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,073
did you,
I'm sure you've talked about this a 

101
00:04:32,921 --> 00:04:33,910
million times.
Did you eat,

102
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,773
did you ever stop going there for a 
chunk of time where you stopped for 

103
00:04:37,271 --> 00:04:38,460
seven years?
Yeah,

104
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:43,110
I stopped for seven years after I had 
that dispute with Carlos Rensea.

105
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:45,443
Yeah.
That was when he was way more popular 

106
00:04:48,971 --> 00:04:49,960
than me,
like,

107
00:04:49,961 --> 00:04:53,470
especially as a comic and the comedy 
store took his side and I was like,

108
00:04:53,471 --> 00:04:54,520
all right,
fuck you guys.

109
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:56,530
And I,
I took off.

110
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,330
It wasn't really the comedy store 
either.

111
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:00,850
It was this one guy who was the manager,
cause Mitzi,

112
00:05:00,851 --> 00:05:05,020
actually I called Mitzi and gave her the
whole rundown of what was going on.

113
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,990
Um,
I told her and she's like,

114
00:05:07,991 --> 00:05:09,880
well I'm ain't gonna just stay away in 
front of mom.

115
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,043
And then she gave me a spot that night 
and then they called me up two hours 

116
00:05:12,941 --> 00:05:15,760
later telling me that I was banned.
So I said,

117
00:05:15,761 --> 00:05:17,740
wait a minute,
I just talk to Mitzi.

118
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:20,680
Like she gave me a spot.
She told me when to go up.

119
00:05:20,681 --> 00:05:22,810
So if,
if she's not running the store,

120
00:05:22,811 --> 00:05:26,590
like who's who's deciding on band?
You are like,

121
00:05:26,591 --> 00:05:27,424
what are you doing?

122
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,710
Like do you guys understand what this 
is?

123
00:05:29,711 --> 00:05:30,544
I mean this is like a little,
you're having a little battle for like 

124
00:05:32,741 --> 00:05:36,490
whether or not you're going to let 
people profit off of crime.

125
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,010
Like this is really what's happening.
You have thought crime,

126
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,083
he have intellectual crime,
you plagiarism and you're allowing one 

127
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:43,624
person,
you knowingly allowing them to profit 

128
00:05:46,031 --> 00:05:48,070
off it and no one's doing anything about
it.

129
00:05:48,071 --> 00:05:50,080
So when one of us does something about 
it,

130
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:54,460
then you're going to punish that person.
You're basically highlighting everything

131
00:05:54,461 --> 00:05:56,230
that everyone was afraid of.
That's a good point.

132
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:57,830
What is like,
what were the,

133
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:01,130
what was the reason for your being 
banned because you were,

134
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,193
well,
because become their end of it was 

135
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:04,573
because we had made a video with me and 
Carlos arguing on stage and then we put 

136
00:06:09,531 --> 00:06:13,100
it on right now that all that this was,
you know,

137
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:13,993
somehow or another and in violation of 
that should have been kept inside the 

138
00:06:15,861 --> 00:06:17,600
club and I'm like,
you don't get it.

139
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,270
You weren't protecting us.
No one was protecting us.

140
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:24,020
My fucking agents dumped me over that.
Oh yeah,

141
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:24,861
over that.
Yeah.

142
00:06:24,861 --> 00:06:26,330
I was with gurse.
They dropped me.

143
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:29,570
They'd call me up to tell me they 
essentially,

144
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:33,800
in this long roundabout way,
we're trying to say that I either had to

145
00:06:33,801 --> 00:06:37,680
apologize or they couldn't work with 
anymore though.

146
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,940
That was the gist of it and I had to 
make them spell it out.

147
00:06:40,941 --> 00:06:43,960
Okay.
Let me say this really clear.

148
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:44,990
You tell me if this is what you're 
saying.

149
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:49,850
You're saying you want me to apologize 
or you can't work with me anymore?

150
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,890
Well,
we're done now.

151
00:06:51,891 --> 00:06:54,230
There's no apology and we'll never get 
to work together.

152
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:56,480
I appreciate everything you've done for 
me and I,

153
00:06:56,481 --> 00:06:58,760
it was really nice to the guy who was a,
it wasn't his idea.

154
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,830
My agent said,
you're a great guy,

155
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:01,550
bye.
See you.

156
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:02,383
I'm giving you a hug.
But you guys have to understand that 

157
00:07:04,101 --> 00:07:04,934
you're making a choice.
It's going to affect the rest of your 

158
00:07:06,111 --> 00:07:08,270
life.
This isn't just a small thing.

159
00:07:08,271 --> 00:07:09,590
You,
you only have a few.

160
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,600
How many years do you have in this life?
Well,

161
00:07:11,601 --> 00:07:14,420
this year is going to be highlighted by 
this decision.

162
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,940
This is going to be at why the agent 
take that stand.

163
00:07:16,941 --> 00:07:18,950
Did they represent him as yes.
Yeah.

164
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:19,950
Okay.
Um,

165
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:20,963
all right.
So they needed to make nice with that 

166
00:07:22,581 --> 00:07:23,120
thing.
He goes,

167
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,040
it made way more money than me.
So it was,

168
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,130
he was way more valuable to them.
And so I'm like,

169
00:07:28,131 --> 00:07:31,280
you gotta make this is you sell art.
It's all you guys do.

170
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,830
Can you not making anything?
You're just,

171
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:37,670
if Mary Lynn comes up with the show,
if this guy has a tour,

172
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:40,070
if she's doing this or he's writing a 
book,

173
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:43,040
you make money off art.
That's how you make money off.

174
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,113
Now here,
you know a guy stealing other people's 

175
00:07:46,611 --> 00:07:51,611
art and your answer to that is we got to
stop people that are exposing it.

176
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:56,310
Did he ever change or not that I even 
matters him.

177
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,540
I hope he did.
He's got to find Jesus.

178
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,570
We just talking about this last night 
sort of.

179
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:03,291
Yeah.
Sort of.

180
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:04,280
And then he kind of took it back.

181
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,790
It's hard to admit.
Should I try?

182
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:10,880
Should I try?
This is insane.

183
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,420
I actually only have like one set,
right?

184
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,313
Crazy.
Do you know my friend Tate Tate 

185
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,133
Fletcher?
Probably seen him around the store 

186
00:08:15,861 --> 00:08:16,970
before.
Big giant gorilla.

187
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,170
Uh,
it's his company.

188
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,330
They're very good,
but don't drink the whole thing.

189
00:08:20,331 --> 00:08:21,440
Mary Lynn.
I like it,

190
00:08:21,441 --> 00:08:24,590
but I'm going to do it if it's a grand 
day coffee.

191
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:25,580
Yeah,
that's about it.

192
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:28,490
Chronic and coffees where the caffeine,
but it's strong.

193
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:29,601
Yeah.
Oh,

194
00:08:29,601 --> 00:08:30,434
she fog.
I got to go work out in your isolation 

195
00:08:34,221 --> 00:08:36,260
tank.
Find Yourself.

196
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,520
I just found myself and I peed a little.
That's okay.

197
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:41,893
Um,
so you started out as a performance 

198
00:08:43,161 --> 00:08:44,480
artists.
Like that was your idea.

199
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,770
What did you want to do that was your 
eye?

200
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,633
That was your big idea.
I went to art school for painting and I 

201
00:08:50,301 --> 00:08:52,420
was uh,
um,

202
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:55,530
got really frustrated when people 
started to,

203
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,153
uh,
critique the paintings and I was 

204
00:08:59,311 --> 00:09:00,210
supposed to be,
you know,

205
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:01,463
getting more serious in art school and 
more conceptual and everyone was doing 

206
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:05,874
something different and everyone was 
critiquing it in a different way and 

207
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:13,041
none of it made sense to me.
And then the idea of having to sell that

208
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:17,010
object that you made,
so you're going to make something that's

209
00:09:17,011 --> 00:09:17,844
useless.
I mean it makes it sound like I don't 

210
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,600
like our appreciate art.
I just,

211
00:09:21,601 --> 00:09:23,340
for me,
I didn't,

212
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:26,670
I couldn't grasp what the next thing to 
do was.

213
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:27,870
You know,
you're poor,

214
00:09:27,871 --> 00:09:28,704
you're an art school,
you're making something and then you 

215
00:09:30,511 --> 00:09:34,520
have to go sell and market that thing.
And uh,

216
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,753
I also was frustrated and,
and kind of like boiling inside and 

217
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:41,874
needed to express myself.
So I started doing performance art in 

218
00:09:44,821 --> 00:09:47,740
school.
And then when you say performance art,

219
00:09:47,741 --> 00:09:51,090
that's a pretty open ended description.
Oh,

220
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:51,924
it's so open ended.
There were so many like weird 

221
00:09:54,271 --> 00:09:56,100
performance art things that would 
happen.

222
00:09:56,101 --> 00:09:57,930
We,
I mean we had performance art class,

223
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:02,160
there was the guy that like taped his 
genitals to the side and put on lipstick

224
00:10:02,161 --> 00:10:06,010
in a mirror and that was his performance
art piece or the girl that,

225
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,070
and we would all sit there and watch it.

226
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,913
Did you see his genitals?
Did he'd go naked and pull it aside or 

227
00:10:14,371 --> 00:10:16,770
how did he do that?
That's a really good question.

228
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,110
I like how your mind just went there.
You're like,

229
00:10:19,111 --> 00:10:24,111
what actually happened?
I think I blocked it out because I think

230
00:10:24,451 --> 00:10:25,284
you could probably get away with doing 
that under the guise of it being 

231
00:10:27,421 --> 00:10:28,830
something you're doing,
you know,

232
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,730
in a class somewhere.
Yes,

233
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,060
yes.
You get away with us.

234
00:10:33,061 --> 00:10:35,730
So pervy I think I was focused on his 
beautiful lips.

235
00:10:35,731 --> 00:10:37,860
I was trying to be polite and not look 
down there.

236
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,860
Another woman was obese and her piece 
was,

237
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,873
she had preset up.
We weren't it where she was doing the 

238
00:10:43,771 --> 00:10:45,120
performance,
uh,

239
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:47,870
butter pats in like dominoes,
like a,

240
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,550
you know,
a few thousand of them in a line.

241
00:10:50,551 --> 00:10:53,460
And she was obese and she crawled on the
ground.

242
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:57,210
She didn't actually eat them,
but it was something that's weird.

243
00:10:57,210 --> 00:11:00,180
My mind kind of drops off.
I remember specific parts of it,

244
00:11:00,181 --> 00:11:01,014
but I don't know.
I think she just was collecting the 

245
00:11:02,641 --> 00:11:05,430
butter pieces and crawling and that was 
her performance.

246
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:07,460
He's another guy.
Uh,

247
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,610
the,
uh,

248
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:09,443
this was,
I went to Detroit and then finished in 

249
00:11:10,741 --> 00:11:11,574
San Francisco.
And San Francisco is known for being a 

250
00:11:13,141 --> 00:11:16,860
real performance art history.
A lot of the,

251
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,140
you know,
the most famous performance artist.

252
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:22,260
Nobody knows where that was.
The scene was in San Francisco.

253
00:11:22,261 --> 00:11:23,094
So,
uh,

254
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,680
it was two story really beautiful 
campus,

255
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:26,521
uh,
overlooking.

256
00:11:26,521 --> 00:11:28,410
You could see a Lombard street on one 
side.

257
00:11:28,411 --> 00:11:29,730
You could see the water on the other 
side.

258
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:32,730
And uh,
another guy's piece was to jump from the

259
00:11:32,731 --> 00:11:37,731
second story to a tree to is like that.
He may or may not have made the jump and

260
00:11:39,361 --> 00:11:42,290
that was his art,
his art pieces.

261
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:44,400
Jumping from a window to a tree.

262
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:46,260
Yeah.
What the fuck?

263
00:11:46,261 --> 00:11:50,610
I know this other guy,
the room where we had our class,

264
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,770
he had a bread machine.
This was back,

265
00:11:53,771 --> 00:11:54,604
you know,
bread machines where new technology had 

266
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:58,990
a breadmaker.
You know those machines you can make a,

267
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,930
I guess it just does the dough,
right?

268
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:02,100
Right.
Maybe it bakes it.

269
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:02,973
I think it just needs the dough and then
you bake it or I don't know if you bake 

270
00:12:05,531 --> 00:12:07,300
it in the machine or no,
you bake it in the machine.

271
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,100
It's all coming back to me.
He bakes it in the machine.

272
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:12,110
We come into the classroom as he's 
baking it.

273
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:13,990
There's always like a reveal and these 
pieces.

274
00:12:13,991 --> 00:12:15,160
Right?
So we come in,

275
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:19,540
he's taken plaster from the wall and put
it in the bread.

276
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:23,830
He's Fed us the bread.
Half of us get it,

277
00:12:23,831 --> 00:12:28,720
half of us don't.
And there's plaster in the price.

278
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:33,480
Why did you put plaster in his bread?
It was something about communism.

279
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,270
Some get the bread,
some don't.

280
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,960
But even if you get the bread,
there's plaster.

281
00:12:42,961 --> 00:12:46,650
And so in your face,
what the fuck?

282
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,473
Oh my God.
See there's something about like 

283
00:12:50,171 --> 00:12:51,004
performance are in slam poetry.
I did slam poetry to that was when Mike 

284
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,170
did.
No,

285
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:59,840
I did.
Here's the best part is I got Zeros.

286
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:01,190
Zeros.
Yeah.

287
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:05,320
You didn't get any why?
I never really wrote any poetry.

288
00:13:05,321 --> 00:13:10,110
I was just into the performance of it.
And I see you didn't have to poke.

289
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:12,280
I was doing comedy.
Oh No.

290
00:13:12,281 --> 00:13:16,090
And I was doing like an awkward thing,
which was very real for me,

291
00:13:16,091 --> 00:13:19,430
but I think I just wanted to express my,
I also had an ex boyfriend who

292
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:24,120
he said the comedy was his life.
This was when I was like 19.

293
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:25,283
And I think I attached to people,
like I thought he was the shit because 

294
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,353
he would be rude to people.
Like that was his version of comedy was 

295
00:13:32,851 --> 00:13:33,684
like bossing people around or one of his
bits was like having a whistle and 

296
00:13:37,801 --> 00:13:41,010
directing traffic.
I mean really adolescent like,

297
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:44,330
but for some reason I was really 
attracted to him and uh,

298
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,413
like I wanted to be him.
Anybody who was like extroverted or 

299
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:52,950
something that I wanted,
that I was attracted to that.

300
00:13:52,951 --> 00:13:53,581
Right.
So,

301
00:13:53,581 --> 00:13:54,870
right.
So he was like,

302
00:13:54,871 --> 00:13:57,630
comedy is my life and I do this open 
mic.

303
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:59,580
And I was like,
I'm going to do that open.

304
00:13:59,581 --> 00:14:00,414
Mike and I had taped like phrases to my 
body and phrases from commercials or 

305
00:14:06,991 --> 00:14:07,824
snippets of conversation that I had 
heard and I went up and I started 

306
00:14:11,161 --> 00:14:11,994
reading them and then I would improvise 
a little bit and I'd be like waxy build 

307
00:14:15,441 --> 00:14:16,274
up or whatever and just repeating,
just letting it all filter through and 

308
00:14:20,191 --> 00:14:24,180
come out my mouth for five minutes of 
whatever the open mic was.

309
00:14:24,181 --> 00:14:25,014
And I started getting laughter,
but it was like awkward laughter after 

310
00:14:28,741 --> 00:14:31,080
the fact of that uncomfortable,
like what?

311
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,230
What is she doing?
But my commitment level was so high that

312
00:14:34,231 --> 00:14:38,520
the fact that it didn't make any sense 
just because laughter.

313
00:14:38,521 --> 00:14:39,061
Right,
right,

314
00:14:39,061 --> 00:14:39,840
right,
right.

315
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,450
Well that's us.
That works sometimes with just even with

316
00:14:42,451 --> 00:14:44,010
comics.
Yes,

317
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,113
absolutely.
There's a lot of people that are just 

318
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:50,640
really odd and if you saw them you would
get it,

319
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:52,100
but if you,
you saw what they

320
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,370
wrote on paper is or what they said just
written down on paper,

321
00:14:55,371 --> 00:14:56,204
you'd be like,
what?

322
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,190
That doesn't make any sense.
Yeah.

323
00:14:58,191 --> 00:14:59,300
Well,
I thought you were going to say,

324
00:14:59,301 --> 00:15:01,250
which is a similar point that,
that,

325
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:04,430
that it comes in the pause and after 
what they're saying,

326
00:15:04,431 --> 00:15:07,160
even if it doesn't make any sense,
but you're saying sometimes people write

327
00:15:07,161 --> 00:15:10,440
things and it makes its own sense when 
you hear them say it,

328
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:14,170
but it's also just about being fully 
commit.

329
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,010
Yes,
yes.

330
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:17,360
Yeah.
And those pauses.

331
00:15:17,361 --> 00:15:18,194
Yeah.
That gives you,

332
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,700
especially with something's really 
absurd,

333
00:15:19,701 --> 00:15:23,000
gives you that opportunity to go watch.
Yeah.

334
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,730
You don't want to just hammer them over 
the head with it.

335
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,080
So you just started doing that.
And how did it lead to actual stand up,

336
00:15:30,081 --> 00:15:30,914
stand up?

337
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,223
MMM,

338
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:33,763
it was a really fun time in San 
Francisco because the comedy clubs were 

339
00:15:36,051 --> 00:15:36,884
closing,
so a lot of comics were coming to these 

340
00:15:38,361 --> 00:15:41,300
open mic poetry rooms.
And one of my favorite rooms was in this

341
00:15:41,301 --> 00:15:42,134
bar.
And also I was from the suburbs of 

342
00:15:43,611 --> 00:15:45,680
Detroit.
And so just being in San Francisco,

343
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,590
that was a real city and a friendly 
city,

344
00:15:48,591 --> 00:15:49,424
you know,
like it's small enough and it's 

345
00:15:50,421 --> 00:15:52,790
beautiful and they have a real arts 
scene.

346
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:53,624
And it was the first time that I had 
seen like a real counter culture and 

347
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:58,520
people that would hang out in coffee 
shops and,

348
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:01,010
and a lot of young people that looked 
like I did.

349
00:16:01,011 --> 00:16:05,210
So I would go to bars for this open mic 
and there'd be um,

350
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:06,643
you know,
like I transvestite who was semi 

351
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,250
homeless,
but it was,

352
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:13,910
you know,
made up who was like reading her poetry.

353
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,910
And I was like,
I'm in like,

354
00:16:16,911 --> 00:16:17,660
I'm done.

355
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,493
And I had no money and I would sit and 
crouch on the floor and drink like a 

356
00:16:21,201 --> 00:16:22,860
half a beer and be like,
oh,

357
00:16:22,861 --> 00:16:24,170
those,
those crazy.

358
00:16:24,171 --> 00:16:25,004
And I would watch her read from her 
journal and I did a similar thing where 

359
00:16:28,191 --> 00:16:29,570
I would just,
and then it was always,

360
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:30,404
I didn't,
I didn't know my own mind or my own 

361
00:16:31,881 --> 00:16:34,220
thoughts really.
So I would write down random words and I

362
00:16:34,221 --> 00:16:37,350
would perform it.
I mean it's still now it's,

363
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:40,070
I've progressed a bit,
but it's like,

364
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:43,490
it informs you how the audience reacts 
or it begins to,

365
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,930
and I just love seeing all these like 
different people and what,

366
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,053
what they thought they were saying 
versus what they were really saying and 

367
00:16:50,361 --> 00:16:54,500
what they're intended effect was and how
people were really seeing them.

368
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,520
Anyway,
so,

369
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:59,330
so comics started dropping into these 
rooms like Patton Oswald and,

370
00:16:59,331 --> 00:17:00,164
um,
Jeremy Kramer and blink a patch and you 

371
00:17:03,351 --> 00:17:04,040
know,
uh,

372
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,520
Greg Bear until these,
uh,

373
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:06,913
Ron Lynch,
people that were more San Francisco 

374
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:13,550
affiliated that were there at that time,
we'd start doing these open Mike Nights.

375
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:14,923
Um,
but because a comic is so versed in 

376
00:17:18,831 --> 00:17:23,490
their own voice that watching them was 
so,

377
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,810
I was like,
oh,

378
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:28,260
that they know how to speak and they're 
more polished.

379
00:17:28,261 --> 00:17:30,120
And then that was attractive to me.
So,

380
00:17:30,121 --> 00:17:30,954
so I kind of gravitated towards,
and there were all these alternative 

381
00:17:34,111 --> 00:17:37,830
rooms that weren't comedy clubs.
And that was like,

382
00:17:37,831 --> 00:17:38,664
I loved that.
I just loved it because there was room 

383
00:17:41,161 --> 00:17:43,710
for mistakes.
There was room for the in between,

384
00:17:43,711 --> 00:17:44,740
you know,
it was like that,

385
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:49,320
the real allseen of that time.
Yeah.

386
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:50,010
That all

387
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:50,843
seems interesting.
It's always interesting when like a 

388
00:17:51,901 --> 00:17:55,110
little branch of a style of comedy 
breaks off,

389
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,513
you know?
And some people do it because that's 

390
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:01,800
like it's,
it feels more true to them.

391
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:02,783
Right.
And then some people do it because it 

392
00:18:03,631 --> 00:18:08,610
seems like the cool hip thing to do and 
then some people it's just a combination

393
00:18:08,611 --> 00:18:09,444
of bolts.
Right.

394
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:11,880
The all teens.
An interesting scene,

395
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,433
you know,
cause it also is attached to that one 

396
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:15,990
place.
It doesn't pay anybody.

397
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,270
The UCB.
Yeah.

398
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:19,590
I was always like,
wait,

399
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,513
what?
Oh you mean cause they're making money 

400
00:18:21,991 --> 00:18:23,310
and no one else's Nikki.
Yeah.

401
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:25,290
I was always like,
what?

402
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:29,220
Huh?
Like how does that make sense?

403
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,950
People don't get paid at comedy clubs as
well.

404
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,260
Well sure they do.
Comedy store pays you,

405
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,290
you mean like 25 bucks,
25 bucks for regular sets.

406
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:38,730
And then do you get a lot more than 
that?

407
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:41,190
If you do the main room,
the main room,

408
00:18:41,191 --> 00:18:42,220
they pay your real money.
You're saying,

409
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:47,221
why doesn't ucb throw 25 bucks to people
that you have to pay if something people

410
00:18:47,431 --> 00:18:48,660
are paying to go there,
right.

411
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:50,940
Paying for gas there,
they're traveling,

412
00:18:50,941 --> 00:18:51,774
they're right,
and you're selling tickets to see them 

413
00:18:53,281 --> 00:18:54,270
do their art.
Right.

414
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,213
That's how it ain't to take that line.
Then everybody should be paid a lot 

415
00:18:58,021 --> 00:19:00,180
more.
There should be genuine percentage.

416
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:01,043
It's really only the comics.
Going back to that argument from a 

417
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,350
comedy store from the 70s that was a,
it's a legit argument.

418
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:10,020
I mean,
it's not legit that,

419
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:10,883
look,
this is where we live and it's a really 

420
00:19:12,001 --> 00:19:13,560
important place to work out.
Right,

421
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:14,543
right.
So we need it and we want it to be 

422
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:16,290
there.
Yeah.

423
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:19,110
And they pay you a little bit.
But if they didn't pay you anything,

424
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:22,470
like the comedy store went ucb and just 
didn't pay anybody anything.

425
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:23,341
Oh,
that's interesting.

426
00:19:23,341 --> 00:19:26,970
So you're saying isn't important.
It's something.

427
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:27,923
Yeah,
like especially it was important when 

428
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:32,550
the club wasn't making any money.
So if the club,

429
00:19:32,551 --> 00:19:33,490
I'm in the old days,
the,

430
00:19:33,491 --> 00:19:34,440
oh,
or you know,

431
00:19:34,441 --> 00:19:35,760
you got that 25 bucks.
Like,

432
00:19:35,761 --> 00:19:38,760
look,
they've given 25 bucks to 15 people.

433
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:41,150
Fine.
How much money are they really making?

434
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:44,760
I get what you're saying.
You're saying has that vibe of like a,

435
00:19:44,761 --> 00:19:45,594
it's a workshop and then you're like,
you guys are making money off of their 

436
00:19:47,851 --> 00:19:49,140
opening up new places,
right?

437
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,790
I mean this is a business,
right?

438
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,250
I'm not telling them what to do or 
telling anybody your performance or what

439
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,750
do I performed there before?
Right.

440
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:57,540
It's just,
it's kind of weird.

441
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:58,374
It's like these festivals,
I got invited to one of those festivals 

442
00:20:00,061 --> 00:20:04,260
once they offered to give me a pass,
like a gold pass where I could watch all

443
00:20:04,261 --> 00:20:05,094
the other acts.
That's what they were going to pay me 

444
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:07,440
with.
They weren't going to fly me.

445
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:09,810
They weren't gonna put up right in a 
hotel.

446
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:11,520
They weren't going to give me any money.

447
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,750
It reminds me of that thing and Steve 
Martin's book where he's,

448
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,810
where he made that choice and again,
a very different time,

449
00:20:16,811 --> 00:20:20,290
very different scene where he's like,
I'm only headlining for money.

450
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,900
But he made that conscious choice that 
would not work now.

451
00:20:22,901 --> 00:20:24,340
And like you said,
we,

452
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,510
you know,
I work out in town,

453
00:20:25,511 --> 00:20:27,430
I don't expect to get paid,
but it does,

454
00:20:27,431 --> 00:20:29,380
it makes a difference that the comedy 
store,

455
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,083
there's a,
that system that is in place really 

456
00:20:33,581 --> 00:20:34,391
works.
You know,

457
00:20:34,391 --> 00:20:36,790
it's like I'm a paid regular.
That was a big deal.

458
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,470
Yeah.
Cause I remember I had been on,

459
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:43,560
on the road doing comedy really for the 
first time in the club proper,

460
00:20:44,051 --> 00:20:46,150
even though I had tons of stage time.
But you know,

461
00:20:46,151 --> 00:20:46,984
back connecting back to that all seen 
where it would be a different thing 

462
00:20:49,391 --> 00:20:50,224
every time.
And I did not quite know what I was 

463
00:20:51,641 --> 00:20:52,480
saying.
So,

464
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:53,613
you know,
in the past four years was when I did 

465
00:20:55,331 --> 00:20:57,460
the six shows per weekend.
And you're like,

466
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,230
I'm your entertainment for the night.
And I,

467
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,790
you know,
learn how to do that.

468
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,740
Like people came out to see you.
Yes.

469
00:21:02,741 --> 00:21:05,770
And like you don't mumble.
Tell them what you're talking about.

470
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,350
Repeat your theme,
you know,

471
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,220
smile,
talk to people.

472
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:09,760
Uh,
you know,

473
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,860
I learned how to do that.
And um,

474
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:14,060
what was my point?
Oh,

475
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:15,790
in any way confined by that

476
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:22,260
because you,
your beginnings were so sort of free and

477
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:24,163
I think it's like a reverse.
The confinement of that is serving me 

478
00:21:28,971 --> 00:21:32,660
because I needed to do that.
It took me,

479
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:35,120
I went about it like completely 
opposite.

480
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:39,530
I was so organic that now I'm finally 
getting some structure.

481
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:41,810
I'm Mike for the first time.
Like,

482
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:42,950
oh,
that's a joke.

483
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,600
I read a joke.
I honestly,

484
00:21:44,601 --> 00:21:45,980
it was like,
like I said,

485
00:21:45,981 --> 00:21:49,670
I had no idea why people were laughing.
I knew I liked it,

486
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,130
but I wasn't exactly sure where it was 
going to come.

487
00:21:52,131 --> 00:21:55,850
And I knew that I had a deep connection 
to it.

488
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,460
You know?
That's what propelled me to do it.

489
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,890
I had a need to,
to do it.

490
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,830
It was the only thing and it kind of 
saved me.

491
00:22:03,831 --> 00:22:04,664
I needed to,
I mean not to get all overly dramatic 

492
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,430
comedy kind of saved you performing.
Yeah.

493
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:12,620
Cause I just was really,
um,

494
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:16,940
uh,
didn't know how to express myself.

495
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:21,140
And it's still to this day is like in 
ever kind of deepening thing,

496
00:22:21,141 --> 00:22:23,000
you know?
Yeah.

497
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:24,500
It's a,
it's a very weird discipline,

498
00:22:24,501 --> 00:22:25,490
right?
Yeah.

499
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:27,690
Okay.

500
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:30,810
It's a weird thing to get involved with,
you know,

501
00:22:30,811 --> 00:22:33,610
chase down these ideas and try to figure
out how to flesh them out.

502
00:22:33,611 --> 00:22:33,890
And

503
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:36,500
do you structure that you feel like you 
were always,

504
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,453
um,
cause I see you as somebody who's like 

505
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,633
so powerful and such,
such a strong point of view in both 

506
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:44,723
strong belief system.
Do you feel like you've always kind of 

507
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:47,723
been that way?

508
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:49,750
No,
I don't think so.

509
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:53,740
I think comedy for sure.
It makes you chase down those ideas.

510
00:22:53,741 --> 00:22:55,810
Like what is,
what is your real feelings on things?

511
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:56,723
Yeah.
Because you're thinking about things so 

512
00:22:57,551 --> 00:22:58,384
often and then as you're saying things,
you think about people's reaction to 

513
00:23:00,941 --> 00:23:02,080
them.
That's a big one.

514
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:03,123
A big one is the comedy has allowed me 
to really pay attention to other 

515
00:23:06,971 --> 00:23:11,971
people's reactions more than like I 
think our wanted to because I think if I

516
00:23:12,731 --> 00:23:16,210
had my own way and I had nothing to do 
with stand up,

517
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,073
I probably would be way more antisocial,
way more guarded and protected and way 

518
00:23:22,751 --> 00:23:25,720
more insecure because I hadn't answered 
those questions.

519
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,600
I didn't pose them up myself cause it 
made me uncomfortable.

520
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:31,420
Yeah.
So what standup allowed me to do,

521
00:23:31,421 --> 00:23:34,390
it's like I wasn't the most outgoing 
person.

522
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,230
Oh really?
Yeah.

523
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:37,220
Yeah.
I was very insecure and uh,

524
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:39,100
even so I would get like social anxiety.

525
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:39,963
I've talked about this before,
but I would like talking to a bank 

526
00:23:41,801 --> 00:23:42,750
teller.
I'd be no,

527
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:46,210
I'd know that I'm next to talk to the 
bank tower and I'd kind of freak out and

528
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,210
I wouldn't know how to,
I would,

529
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:50,780
wouldn't exactly know how to talk and 
say things and do it right.

530
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,720
But it changed from teaching martial 
arts.

531
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:54,863
I want to start teaching martial arts.
I learned how to project in front of 

532
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,353
this big room full of people.
It's something I never imagined I was 

533
00:24:01,851 --> 00:24:05,480
going to do any public speaking before 
that it was never on the menu.

534
00:24:05,481 --> 00:24:08,740
I never even thought about it.
But when I taught classes I had to teach

535
00:24:08,741 --> 00:24:11,090
them and I was teaching like in 
universities,

536
00:24:11,091 --> 00:24:13,610
I've taught at bu and I taught at some 
other places,

537
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:16,610
some other gyms and stuff.
And you know,

538
00:24:16,611 --> 00:24:18,200
you have to get these people's 
attention.

539
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:20,420
You have to be clear and you have to 
have confidence and,

540
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:23,660
but I knew what I was doing.
Martial arts ask you that.

541
00:24:23,661 --> 00:24:25,730
It probably helped a lot for sure.
If you were nervous,

542
00:24:25,731 --> 00:24:27,890
you were like,
let the skill kind of takeover.

543
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,233
We would oftentimes,
if we opened up a new school somewhere 

544
00:24:30,741 --> 00:24:34,670
where we'd do a demonstration and then 
we did give a speech afterwards,

545
00:24:34,671 --> 00:24:37,610
explain what the martial arts were.
But we'd do a demonstration for us.

546
00:24:37,611 --> 00:24:38,444
Like people would hold like boards and 
shit and he'd kick him and stuff like 

547
00:24:41,091 --> 00:24:42,500
that,
which we never did in real life.

548
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:45,140
We only did for demonstrations.
Like we never trained that way.

549
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,960
But my point was like getting into stand
up.

550
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:50,780
I didn't have a particularly clean point
of view.

551
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,160
I think I was 21 years old.
I was,

552
00:24:53,161 --> 00:24:54,670
I think it was a moron.
You know,

553
00:24:54,671 --> 00:24:59,450
I didn't have any life experience other 
than martial arts and girls.

554
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,760
Like that was all I could talk about.
And I didn't,

555
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:03,680
I knew martial arts weren't really 
funny,

556
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:07,790
so it was just relationship stuff.
But um,

557
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,920
hey guys,
how about when we hit that block?

558
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:11,680
We don't really do that.
I'm all right.

559
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:15,530
I was kicking those blocks of wood guys.
Seriously.

560
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:17,271
Yeah.
I mean,

561
00:25:17,271 --> 00:25:22,271
I had a similar thing of it.

562
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:24,920
It helps,
yeah.

563
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:27,410
To just even say anything and to be 
like,

564
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:28,520
oh,
I exist.

565
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,850
I have a voice and I'm just now starting
to,

566
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:35,270
I mean,
I've a lot of material that's true,

567
00:25:35,271 --> 00:25:38,900
but I'm just now kind of starting to 
build that deeper,

568
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,110
um,
the belief system thing.

569
00:25:42,111 --> 00:25:42,944
You know,
like I talk about my personal life and 

570
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,460
there are kernels of things in there,
but it's,

571
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:49,100
it's scary to kind of come out.

572
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,353
Yeah.
But it's fun because that's what people 

573
00:25:52,731 --> 00:25:53,451
want,
you know?

574
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:54,284
That's what,
like,

575
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:57,440
that's what gets it going and that's 
what gets everybody excited.

576
00:25:57,441 --> 00:25:58,410
And that's what,
uh,

577
00:25:59,030 --> 00:25:59,990
that's cool.
Yeah.

578
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:03,710
You know what comedy is Tommy?
One really important thing as a person,

579
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,650
you're not done.
Like there's no,

580
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,480
there's no like you're a finished 
product.

581
00:26:08,481 --> 00:26:09,230
Yeah,
I did it.

582
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:10,350
No,
your change,

583
00:26:10,351 --> 00:26:11,184
depending upon your attitude about how 
you look at your very existence right 

584
00:26:13,911 --> 00:26:16,670
now,
I get you in shift within an hour.

585
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:18,650
It could shift back and forth.
You could,

586
00:26:18,651 --> 00:26:21,620
it could shift in a day or two.
It's like if you take a few weeks off of

587
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:22,820
standing up,
can I ask you that?

588
00:26:22,821 --> 00:26:24,560
Do you,
is it hard for you to get back?

589
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:27,140
Chat always feels weird.
I haven't done it very often,

590
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:28,303
but um,
I did it a couple of times in my career 

591
00:26:30,411 --> 00:26:31,244
where I got like surgery or something 
like that and I had to take some time 

592
00:26:33,381 --> 00:26:34,214
off and then I got burnt out once,
maybe like five years ago and I took 

593
00:26:37,851 --> 00:26:38,900
three months off.

594
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,340
And also that,
that was crazy.

595
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:44,430
That was real weird.
But then when I got back into it,

596
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:47,070
it was before I came back to the store 
too.

597
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:50,280
So it was a real issue with me.
Like going on stage,

598
00:26:50,281 --> 00:26:53,610
like the Improv never felt like home.
It was like a place to fuck around.

599
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:55,050
It's a nice club,
but it never,

600
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,340
I didn't hang out there.
It just felt weird.

601
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,573
Didn't feel the same.
So I'd just do a set there and then I'd 

602
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:01,463
get out of here.
So I was missing like the camaraderie 

603
00:27:03,031 --> 00:27:03,864
aspect of it and I had just finished a 
special and I just didn't want to do 

604
00:27:07,171 --> 00:27:08,004
anything for awhile.
I wanted to chill and so I took like 

605
00:27:09,511 --> 00:27:10,344
three months off.
But then when I came back I came back 

606
00:27:12,811 --> 00:27:16,800
with like a lot of purpose,
like a really was enthusiastic about it.

607
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,633
I had been thinking about coming back 
for like a couple of weeks before I 

608
00:27:19,111 --> 00:27:21,930
actually did it.
But um,

609
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:26,190
you,
you're always working at it like always,

610
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,330
it's always,
you're always,

611
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:28,730
you're always in,
in,

612
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:33,770
in the process of like reaffirming,
thinking things through,

613
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,560
understanding who you are.
It varies with your health,

614
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:41,580
varies with how you're eating.
It varies with who's in your life.

615
00:27:41,581 --> 00:27:42,414
Like your comedy radically varies.
Like how you interface with an audience 

616
00:27:45,751 --> 00:27:47,100
radically.
How you look at yourself.

617
00:27:47,101 --> 00:27:49,590
All that vary so much.
It's never done.

618
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,950
Have you ever been on stage and just,
uh,

619
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:56,520
been,
not angry but like not enjoying,

620
00:27:56,770 --> 00:28:00,360
kind of not wanting to be on stage and 
it shows in your performance there.

621
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:05,540
Do you always get out of it through 
performing then you can get upset.

622
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,133
There's,
there was a woman who kept heckling me 

623
00:28:08,761 --> 00:28:09,594
in the front row of the comedy store 
just interrupting to stopping bits 

624
00:28:12,721 --> 00:28:14,400
before I had a chance to explain them.

625
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,970
And then finally I had to kick her out 
and it was so annoying.

626
00:28:17,971 --> 00:28:20,580
The way she did it was,
it was so entitled,

627
00:28:20,581 --> 00:28:23,580
like she was entitled to voice out her 
opinion in the middle.

628
00:28:23,581 --> 00:28:24,414
It wasn't what I was doing.
This chunk last year on my last special 

629
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:30,150
about this guy who broke into the White 
House,

630
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,550
that a guy just broke into the White 
House.

631
00:28:32,551 --> 00:28:33,384
You would think there would be all these
things in place to keep someone for 

632
00:28:34,711 --> 00:28:37,230
breaking the White House.
The guy just humped across the lawn,

633
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,310
ran across lauren gods in the front door
and there was only a girl sitting there,

634
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:41,163
one unarmed girl by herself.
He smacked her the ground and just ran 

635
00:28:44,581 --> 00:28:45,414
to the fucking White House.
And I had this whole bit about who's 

636
00:28:48,121 --> 00:28:51,600
idea it was to have this leave a girl by
herself.

637
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,720
I've seen.
Yeah.

638
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:56,550
And then then I said that this is the 
part,

639
00:28:56,551 --> 00:28:57,870
like this lady interrupted me.

640
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,580
Um,
I said,

641
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:02,260
a lot of people think that women can do 
anything men can do.

642
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:03,510
Right.
And I go,

643
00:29:03,511 --> 00:29:07,640
well that doesn't make sense because men
can't even do everything men can do.

644
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:11,220
So I was in the middle of saying that 
doesn't even make sense because,

645
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,050
and the joke is an idea.
Explain it.

646
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:14,820
Do I go I,
the joke is lady,

647
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:15,983
I've met Shaquille o'neal and his Dick 
is where my face is and if the White 

648
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:23,820
House has experienced in a shack attack,
I'm the wrong dude to save the world.

649
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:26,700
He's going to run me over.
But you know,

650
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,713
and that I tried to explain that and 
like she just wanted to interrupt 

651
00:29:30,961 --> 00:29:32,670
anything that had to do with men or 
women.

652
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,550
So that was annoying.
And I did not have a good set that night

653
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:39,690
cause it was like Jesus Christ crisis,
get the fuck out of here and had a kid.

654
00:29:39,691 --> 00:29:40,524
And she had apparently had done that to 
some guys that were on before and she 

655
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:45,460
was so drunk when I was looking at it in
their eyes,

656
00:29:45,461 --> 00:29:46,294
weren't focusing just just some smart 
lady that was drunk that thought she 

657
00:29:50,651 --> 00:29:54,490
could stop what she thought was sexism 
probably because she was drunk.

658
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:59,670
But there's a difference between like 
you then overcoming it and being like,

659
00:30:00,671 --> 00:30:01,930
ha ha,
that was awesome.

660
00:30:01,931 --> 00:30:03,940
And then the feeling of I think what 
I'm,

661
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:05,160
I was tense.

662
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:05,993
Yeah.
Like that where you're just inside your 

663
00:30:07,861 --> 00:30:09,770
own head going,
I don't want to be here like

664
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:10,663
that sacked like it's not fun that it 
was just like I shouldn't have allowed 

665
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:14,960
myself to get so upset.
But I,

666
00:30:14,961 --> 00:30:15,794
I came into the stage upset.
That was part of the problem is that I 

667
00:30:19,371 --> 00:30:20,204
had a crazy day with a lot of fucked up 
things happened and I carry that energy 

668
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,393
onto the stage.
There was a lot of weird shit that 

669
00:30:27,291 --> 00:30:29,690
happened in my life that day.
It was just like enough,

670
00:30:29,691 --> 00:30:32,390
enough fucking enough and then her own,
yeah,

671
00:30:32,391 --> 00:30:35,900
it was like weird shit with friends and 
a couple of weird business things.

672
00:30:35,901 --> 00:30:39,590
It was like a compounding day and then 
this lady was hammered and just,

673
00:30:39,591 --> 00:30:39,991
and,
and I,

674
00:30:39,991 --> 00:30:40,824
I gave her the bed,
I tried to talk her into just release 

675
00:30:43,701 --> 00:30:44,534
and explained there,
this is how the bit would have gone if 

676
00:30:45,951 --> 00:30:47,270
you didn't know rob.
I go,

677
00:30:47,271 --> 00:30:47,991
okay,
get it.

678
00:30:47,991 --> 00:30:49,310
See,
I'm gonna say something outrageous.

679
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:51,620
Then I'm going to say something more 
fucked up about myself.

680
00:30:51,621 --> 00:30:52,454
This is what I do.
So I did it again and she interrupted 

681
00:30:53,991 --> 00:30:54,471
again.
I'm like,

682
00:30:54,471 --> 00:30:55,940
get the fuck out.
Just get out.

683
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,170
Just get out.
And I was,

684
00:30:57,171 --> 00:31:00,650
but it was really upset and you 
shouldn't really get upset.

685
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:02,720
So when you allowed yourself get really 
upset,

686
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:06,650
it's usually because you came into it 
unbalanced.

687
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:07,680
And again,
right?

688
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:10,040
It's always you're death,
you're never done.

689
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,180
Like you might think,
well,

690
00:31:11,181 --> 00:31:14,060
I understand how to behave now.
I've got my shit together.

691
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,500
I get it.
But you don't,

692
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:17,030
you do,
you get it right now.

693
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,760
But if you let it slip,
you won't get it tomorrow.

694
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:20,623
If you have the wrong attitude or the 
wrong approach and the wrong dude cuts 

695
00:31:24,561 --> 00:31:26,270
you off,
you're like fuck off.

696
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:27,163
Like,
ah,

697
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:29,270
that come from shit.
You know?

698
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:30,910
And yeah,

699
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:32,470
going back to what we were talking about
earlier,

700
00:31:32,471 --> 00:31:35,200
that when you said you're not awkward,
I you two things,

701
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:36,503
you are,
you're much more of a teddy bear now 

702
00:31:38,861 --> 00:31:40,330
than you used to be.
Don't you think?

703
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:43,490
I've never thought of myself as a teddy 
bear,

704
00:31:43,491 --> 00:31:44,280
but,

705
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,000
well,
when I see,

706
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,340
and now you're just like,
you're just not,

707
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:48,203
I don't,
I'm not saying you weren't like this 

708
00:31:49,021 --> 00:31:49,854
before,
but you just are so like positive and 

709
00:31:51,661 --> 00:31:54,120
loving,
loving and kind of like,

710
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,910
you know,
you can feel it and whereas,

711
00:31:57,770 --> 00:31:59,860
you know,
there's a lot of baggage in the past and

712
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,290
we never,
not baggage,

713
00:32:01,291 --> 00:32:02,160
but like,
I was like,

714
00:32:02,161 --> 00:32:02,994
oh,
that guy hates women or that guy hates 

715
00:32:04,621 --> 00:32:05,454
me.
But that was also when Duncan was 

716
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,400
hanging out with you.
You know,

717
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:10,500
he and I,
he just broke up.

718
00:32:10,501 --> 00:32:12,460
So that was the baggage I was referring 
to,

719
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,110
but like,
oh,

720
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:14,370
you know,
I just thought,

721
00:32:14,371 --> 00:32:16,410
you know,
you have such a strong energy that I was

722
00:32:16,411 --> 00:32:18,210
like,
oh that guy and I,

723
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,103
not that I,

724
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:23,220
it's weird because I wasn't like,
I just was,

725
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:28,250
I just never pictured us talking easily.
Yeah.

726
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:31,380
Not saying that it wouldn't have 
happened then it cause it just didn't,

727
00:32:31,381 --> 00:32:32,350
but I was like,
Whoa,

728
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:34,470
what's up with that dude?
I get it.

729
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:37,620
I've said odd onstage a bunch of times.
I like,

730
00:32:37,621 --> 00:32:39,980
I look like a sexist.
Like I look like

731
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,660
that I would be a dick.
I just,

732
00:32:41,661 --> 00:32:43,280
that's what I look like.
You know,

733
00:32:43,281 --> 00:32:44,114
there's like not much you can do it,
but if you lift weights and you have a 

734
00:32:45,741 --> 00:32:47,240
fat head,
you know,

735
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:50,660
you look like a dickhead.
There's just right.

736
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:55,690
There's no way around it.
I was like kind of watching some of your

737
00:32:55,701 --> 00:32:58,880
recent podcasts where it was like one of
the shirts,

738
00:32:58,881 --> 00:33:03,881
the feminine for the future is feminine,
Feminine.

739
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,713
I want to where I want to,
where the future is masculine and you 

740
00:33:07,991 --> 00:33:08,824
where the future is feminine.
And then we just walk around or 

741
00:33:13,131 --> 00:33:15,730
whatever.
And opposite.

742
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:21,390
Like if I built my compound it'd be like
crystals and lavender and soft.

743
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:23,960
You know what the problem with that 
statement,

744
00:33:23,961 --> 00:33:26,960
the future is feminist is the problem 
with every single statement.

745
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:30,500
You cannot boil down the future of one 
fucking sentence.

746
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:32,990
You just can't be funny.

747
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:35,090
Preposterous.
It would be fine.

748
00:33:35,091 --> 00:33:38,600
I would like to just where the future is
masculine and just not acknowledge it.

749
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:39,720
What's up?
Yeah.

750
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:43,040
The future's masculine guys get used to 
it.

751
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:47,070
I should roll pack of cigarettes.
And what are your sleeves like?

752
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:51,350
The fonz fuck you man.
Is that masculine?

753
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:53,390
Yeah.
No it makes no sense.

754
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,433
No silly.
Oh and then the other thing that when I 

755
00:33:56,091 --> 00:33:58,070
was talking about going on the road,
um,

756
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:01,490
which I was going to mention coming back
to the store,

757
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:05,270
cause I was there in the 90s to when it 
was just like a terrible place and a bad

758
00:34:05,271 --> 00:34:08,900
vibe and like dark and Dank.
And what year did you get there?

759
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:09,843
Uh,
I moved to La in [inaudible] 94 and I 

760
00:34:13,701 --> 00:34:16,440
was in San Francisco,
Cisco for a couple of years before that.

761
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,293
[inaudible] 94 or 95 or six.
You perform at the clubs in San 

762
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:22,400
Francisco as well?
I did.

763
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,700
Um,
we did bars.

764
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,050
I never did the punchline.
You still done it?

765
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:28,310
Have you done it?
So I have,

766
00:34:28,311 --> 00:34:29,144
yeah,
it's fun.

767
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:31,730
It's great.
I love it.

768
00:34:31,731 --> 00:34:33,950
Yeah.
COBB's was a little strange.

769
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:37,310
Big Ceiling.
It's so big and the people were way back

770
00:34:37,311 --> 00:34:39,260
there that are in the balcony there way 
back.

771
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:40,550
Oh my gosh.
Hi.

772
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:43,910
Hi back there.
My husband who like he used to before we

773
00:34:43,911 --> 00:34:44,744
had a child,
he used to come see my one woman show 

774
00:34:45,741 --> 00:34:47,640
that I did.
I think he came like,

775
00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:51,470
anyway,
he saw me at cobbs and he sat back there

776
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:53,810
and he,
it was a great assessment cause he goes,

777
00:34:53,811 --> 00:34:56,120
you've gotten really good because I had 
met on the road,

778
00:34:56,121 --> 00:34:56,954
but he goes,
that's a really hard room because these 

779
00:34:58,851 --> 00:35:00,230
people,
especially that late show,

780
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:03,940
like they've just had dinner and they're
there and it's so dark and it's,

781
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,810
it's like a room.

782
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,980
I don't know.
Some people love it,

783
00:35:06,981 --> 00:35:10,880
but it's a room that's sort of seen its 
heyday at a different time that it would

784
00:35:10,881 --> 00:35:12,650
be packed out.
I don't know.

785
00:35:12,651 --> 00:35:17,060
Maybe you like it if you pack it out 
there to see you.

786
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,073
I do like that room,
but it's a different room than it used 

787
00:35:20,391 --> 00:35:22,040
to be.
Do I used to the old cobb's?

788
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:24,680
That's where I met 'em man.
I did.

789
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:27,140
That's where I met Alma.
I'll juggle all magical.

790
00:35:27,141 --> 00:35:31,070
Started working together and like 1919 
fucking eight or some shit.

791
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:32,900
Yeah,
it was a long time ago,

792
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,630
but I'm,
the old one was tiny,

793
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,770
like just a little bit bigger than the 
belly room.

794
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:38,843
I mean it was like like a hundred seats 
or something like that was really 

795
00:35:41,191 --> 00:35:44,310
ridiculously small.
I think I might be off by a little,

796
00:35:44,311 --> 00:35:45,144
it might be like 130 but they would 
stuff everybody in there to get 130 and 

797
00:35:48,421 --> 00:35:51,090
it was this tiny little club and I used 
to work at,

798
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,190
even though,
um,

799
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,093
it would actually,
I could make less money there then I 

800
00:35:55,051 --> 00:35:57,720
could at at the punchline.
I liked it better.

801
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,280
I was like,
this place is better.

802
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:00,840
It's like,
it's grimy,

803
00:36:00,841 --> 00:36:02,770
it's tiny.
And then Tom saw,

804
00:36:02,771 --> 00:36:05,520
or the guy who ran it was like a s a 
huge comedy nerd,

805
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:07,500
like a dude,
really love comedy.

806
00:36:07,501 --> 00:36:09,210
And so I liked that and they're like,
good,

807
00:36:09,211 --> 00:36:10,890
he's supporting good comedy.
Fuck it.

808
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:14,220
So I started going there.
So then when they turned it into the new

809
00:36:14,221 --> 00:36:14,820
place,
I was like,

810
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:17,100
this is the opposite of what you guys,
right.

811
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:21,450
You guys were the most intimate club and
now you're the cavernous.

812
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:22,800
That makes sense.
Cause it,

813
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:24,850
yeah.
Clubs have to be like,

814
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:26,830
there's got to be right on top of you.

815
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:28,693
Okay.
I came back from going on the road for 

816
00:36:31,671 --> 00:36:35,990
the first time and doing the six shows 
and I was on 24,

817
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:36,853
which I love the word just full on 
comedy shop talking by the way that we 

818
00:36:41,751 --> 00:36:43,670
do that all the time.
I do that a long time.

819
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:46,330
Does it feel unusual?
No,

820
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,151
no.
I know,

821
00:36:47,151 --> 00:36:48,440
I like it.
I like it.

822
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,560
Um,
I just got a little self conscious for a

823
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,810
minute anyway.
The rooms and the ceiling.

824
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:55,070
That's interesting.
Funny thing.

825
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,333
I think people enjoy it too because 
they're like hearing people who were 

826
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,710
professionals talk about what makes it 
good and what makes it bad.

827
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:03,450
Then when they're there themselves like,
oh yeah,

828
00:37:03,451 --> 00:37:05,580
the room's Kinda high on this place.
Oh,

829
00:37:05,581 --> 00:37:06,600
this place is intimate.

830
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:08,260
Okay.
So I was on,

831
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:09,183
uh,
you gave me the confidence to get back 

832
00:37:10,271 --> 00:37:11,104
in it.
So I was on 24 when it came back and we 

833
00:37:13,781 --> 00:37:17,410
filmed in London because it had been 
done for like two years and they brought

834
00:37:17,411 --> 00:37:18,244
it back and it was the end of that 
airing and it was the first time I was 

835
00:37:22,301 --> 00:37:23,134
going on the road as a comic.
So because my face was on TV and people 

836
00:37:27,221 --> 00:37:28,054
were super into 24,
my shows packed out the first time I'd 

837
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:32,740
ever gone on the road.
Right.

838
00:37:32,741 --> 00:37:33,574
My first 45 50 minute show and I first 
hit the stage at like side splitters 

839
00:37:38,081 --> 00:37:39,280
Tamba or whatever,
you know,

840
00:37:39,281 --> 00:37:41,170
he's like,
use all your shows are sold out.

841
00:37:41,171 --> 00:37:43,300
And um,
first of all,

842
00:37:43,301 --> 00:37:46,300
my opener and my middle are like,
this is great.

843
00:37:46,301 --> 00:37:47,720
It's sold out.
But then when they got on the stage,

844
00:37:47,721 --> 00:37:48,430
they come up,
they're like,

845
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:52,660
your audience is weird because they're 
24 fans and they were all,

846
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:54,010
they don't come out to clubs.

847
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:54,370
Right,
right,

848
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:54,740
right,
right.

849
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:56,380
Like I would sometimes have somebody 
sitting,

850
00:37:56,381 --> 00:37:57,214
like with this guy had an article of 
clothing that I had worn and season 

851
00:38:00,401 --> 00:38:01,870
three,
so I'm like trying to do comedy.

852
00:38:01,871 --> 00:38:02,680
Like,
oh,

853
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,513
okay,
like you just want me to sign your 

854
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:06,460
thing.
But you know,

855
00:38:06,461 --> 00:38:09,070
in my approach was,
because I'm in my own head,

856
00:38:09,071 --> 00:38:10,030
so I'm like,
hi.

857
00:38:10,031 --> 00:38:14,170
So my name's Mary Lynn and doing,
doing my like I'm uncomfortable.

858
00:38:14,171 --> 00:38:17,320
And that's where my comedy comes around.
And the whole vibe was like,

859
00:38:17,321 --> 00:38:18,940
what?
You know,

860
00:38:18,941 --> 00:38:22,120
like your TV star.
Like we came to see you and I,

861
00:38:22,121 --> 00:38:27,121
and I had to adjust and like take that 
in and then not only take it in but talk

862
00:38:27,641 --> 00:38:28,391
about it,
you know,

863
00:38:28,391 --> 00:38:28,900
like,
yeah,

864
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:29,733
you know,
and I would just be like Jack Bauer and 

865
00:38:30,431 --> 00:38:31,350
they'd be like,
ha ha.

866
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,060
Like losing their shit and like,
wow,

867
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,010
I would just make somebody in the 
audience like my Jack Bauer

868
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:37,090
and then I just,
you know,

869
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:40,840
how to make it like five,
10 15 minutes of like,

870
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:44,230
let's talk about it.
Because it was such an amazing thing,

871
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,820
you know?
And it was to me too,

872
00:38:45,821 --> 00:38:48,520
but I had this hope that was the only 
drama I had ever been on.

873
00:38:48,521 --> 00:38:52,150
And I have this whole other world of 
comedy that I had been doing,

874
00:38:52,151 --> 00:38:56,410
but the intersection of that was just 
like bizarre.

875
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:57,251
But,
but then I,

876
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:58,690
you know,
like you said,

877
00:38:58,691 --> 00:39:01,380
you're never done and you never know 
what's going to happen and you adjust to

878
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:02,223
it.
So I would do the 24 stuff and then I 

879
00:39:04,001 --> 00:39:04,834
would go into my stuff.
That's my stuff about my life and my 

880
00:39:08,501 --> 00:39:12,460
personal life and my point of view.
And then that became really gratifying.

881
00:39:12,461 --> 00:39:16,330
You know,
once I sort of brought them in,

882
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:19,360
did the thing that they needed to hear 
about,

883
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:21,430
which is also part of my life.

884
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,293
So you know,
how long did it take before they stop 

885
00:39:24,281 --> 00:39:25,114
coming to see you?
Because you're from 24 and started 

886
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:29,320
coming to see you because you're a funny
comic.

887
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:31,900
Oh,
I'm still waiting for that to happen.

888
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:36,700
I'm still hoping for a career in comedy.
No,

889
00:39:36,701 --> 00:39:38,290
seriously.
Then it dropped off.

890
00:39:38,291 --> 00:39:39,124
Right.
So I did that same circuit a year and a 

891
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:41,883
half later and there'd be some super 
fans or be some comedy fans and there'd 

892
00:39:44,231 --> 00:39:46,390
be some people that didn't know why the 
hell they were there.

893
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:48,820
So then I would have,
yeah,

894
00:39:48,821 --> 00:39:49,654
the guy that knows me from always sunny 
in Philadelphia at the lady that knows 

895
00:39:52,031 --> 00:39:55,120
me from 24 and the guy who was out of 
his mind on drugs going,

896
00:39:55,121 --> 00:39:56,500
you're not funny.
And I'm like,

897
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,740
this poor person's like,
she's the superstar.

898
00:39:59,741 --> 00:40:01,840
Like why is she in this shit hole?
And then other guys,

899
00:40:01,841 --> 00:40:02,890
like I don't know who she is.

900
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:03,723
And then that guys like,
you don't get what I get because she's 

901
00:40:05,471 --> 00:40:06,304
from always sunny in Philadelphia.
And then I would pit them against each 

902
00:40:08,651 --> 00:40:09,220
other.
I'm like,

903
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,930
she doesn't get it.
But you get it.

904
00:40:10,931 --> 00:40:13,930
And it's like the burden of being so 
versatile,

905
00:40:13,931 --> 00:40:16,390
you know,
such a cross to bear.

906
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:17,943
It must've been a fun transition though 
once you got through the initial stages 

907
00:40:20,531 --> 00:40:23,200
because a lot of people would have 
bailed like a lot of people.

908
00:40:23,201 --> 00:40:23,921
Okay.
Fuck,

909
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:25,570
fuck doing in the road.
This is just too crazy.

910
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,770
Yeah.
I love it.

911
00:40:26,771 --> 00:40:28,030
I mean it sucks,
but I love it.

912
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:28,893
It's awesome.
But it's sorta changed who you are then 

913
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,050
what you think of you.
So you're like a real comic now.

914
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,580
Yeah.
Yeah.

915
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:38,163
You know,
for so many years I had that little 

916
00:40:39,941 --> 00:40:40,521
like,
oh,

917
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:42,520
you haven't done the road,
like you haven't really done it.

918
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,580
And now I'm like,
no,

919
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:44,020
no,
I,

920
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:46,690
I know how to do the fuck.
There's so many people that don't do the

921
00:40:46,691 --> 00:40:49,030
road that I wish would leave.
You know,

922
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:50,620
like God,
you got to experience it.

923
00:40:50,621 --> 00:40:51,500
You've got to go out there,
you and,

924
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,470
but they don't want to do like the 
Shitty road.

925
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,210
Well,
you have to do the Shitty road.

926
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:58,030
I also learned something about myself,
the Shitty road,

927
00:40:58,090 --> 00:40:59,290
um,
because I,

928
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,760
I would not have a car and I take the 
hotel that they gave me that would be by

929
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:06,520
the freeway,
that would be not even near the city and

930
00:41:06,521 --> 00:41:09,090
a little bit from the club.
And I just hold up and then I,

931
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,660
it took me a while to realize like,
oh,

932
00:41:10,661 --> 00:41:11,494
you like that.
Like I like a certain amount of 

933
00:41:13,541 --> 00:41:15,720
suffering and like,
uh,

934
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,593
so shitty here.
I'm going to go like walk along the 

935
00:41:18,011 --> 00:41:19,480
freeway and then,
you know,

936
00:41:19,481 --> 00:41:20,460
someone would be like,
why don't you,

937
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:21,610
why didn't you get a car?
And like,

938
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:22,503
I don't know,
I just walked over to Chili's for lunch 

939
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:26,163
and uh,
along the grass and the side of the 

940
00:41:28,751 --> 00:41:31,180
freeway.
I like it.

941
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,340
I like it.
So you actually like

942
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:39,370
the dinginess of weird cities.
So are we saying yeah,

943
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:40,633
or I don't know.
The part of me likes the shittiness of 

944
00:41:45,681 --> 00:41:47,120
it,
just to like,

945
00:41:47,121 --> 00:41:47,954
there was one house gask I don't know 
why there was one hotel room that had 

946
00:41:52,281 --> 00:41:52,470
like

947
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:56,400
got a dining room table for 10 and like 
this big,

948
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:57,263
these big plastic flowers with dust all 
over them and this weird hot plate with 

949
00:42:00,691 --> 00:42:05,691
foil on it and a walk in closet.
But it was the shittiest most run down,

950
00:42:06,031 --> 00:42:11,031
like who's who's partying in here?
Like who's fancy hotel suite is this.

951
00:42:11,641 --> 00:42:13,610
It couldn't have been shittier.
Yeah.

952
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:16,260
And it was,
yeah,

953
00:42:16,261 --> 00:42:17,970
I guess it's just fascinating.
And,

954
00:42:18,090 --> 00:42:21,000
and I,
I like being comfortable,

955
00:42:21,001 --> 00:42:23,580
you know,
I like having my things,

956
00:42:23,581 --> 00:42:26,540
but I guess I like that too.
Yeah.

957
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:28,790
I like feeling the pain of that.
What?

958
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:31,080
Whatever.
I'm just not being comfortable,

959
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:34,230
but it also,
because it's in contrast to your life in

960
00:42:34,231 --> 00:42:35,190
La,
right?

961
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:36,330
I mean,
yeah.

962
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:39,650
Fucking TV star.
Got some cash.

963
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:40,550
Hmm.
All right.

964
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:43,640
So then you can do it on the road all 
the time.

965
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:47,450
I've seen those pictures on instagram 
and you just throw it and gold.

966
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:49,850
She's throwing it up in the air.
Ooh.

967
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:52,850
Um,
but here thing is isolation tank.

968
00:42:52,851 --> 00:42:53,684
Mine is,
I get in one of those blowers where the 

969
00:42:54,651 --> 00:42:56,660
money,
that's what I do in the morning.

970
00:42:56,661 --> 00:42:58,790
I just get my little room.
I'm like the money,

971
00:42:58,791 --> 00:43:02,300
it's just a cycle and have hundreds of 
around me.

972
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:05,230
I get up money massage.
Yeah,

973
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:06,073
it's so great.
But when you're in the road and you're 

974
00:43:08,601 --> 00:43:12,730
in like a shitty hotel in Pittsburgh or 
something,

975
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:15,350
it's in the middle of January.
You look out in the skies.

976
00:43:15,351 --> 00:43:18,530
I got shitty dark,
smoky gray.

977
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:21,180
There's not even a hint of Sun.
It's noon.

978
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,740
You look out nothing.
Yeah.

979
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:27,020
Everybody's got this look on their face.
Everybody just sour puss,

980
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:30,020
just wiping dust off the window.
So

981
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:35,530
I like that weird air conditioning or 
heater that doesn't really work and just

982
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:37,600
crank on.
Yeah,

983
00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:38,340
yeah,
yeah.

984
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:40,050
In the middle of the night.
You can't control them.

985
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:42,120
An asshole man.

986
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:46,250
I once had a lady in a hotel room.
Uh,

987
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:51,840
how did this go?
She was the receptionist.

988
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:54,030
God,
it's all a blur.

989
00:43:54,031 --> 00:43:56,090
I don't even remember what city it is.
Um,

990
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:59,490
one of those low,
mid hotels.

991
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:01,710
She calls me,
I'm napping.

992
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:03,450
It's like after you do the radio or 
something.

993
00:44:03,451 --> 00:44:04,470
I'm napping.
Oh,

994
00:44:04,471 --> 00:44:05,520
hi.
Um,

995
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:09,270
there's a fan down here with a bottle of
wine for you.

996
00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:12,330
Can I send him up?
Swear to God.

997
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:17,730
I've never felt more unsafe or on the 
verge of a breakdown.

998
00:44:17,731 --> 00:44:18,960
First of all,
you woke me up.

999
00:44:19,470 --> 00:44:20,700
Second of all,
you're,

1000
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:21,713
you're the gateway between,
but it was such a small town and it was 

1001
00:44:25,921 --> 00:44:28,170
so,
such a foreign concept to her.

1002
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:29,910
To me,
I was like,

1003
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:31,950
that's inherent.
Like you're right,

1004
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:32,813
you're the protection that I have from,
should I send him up a stranger who 

1005
00:44:37,981 --> 00:44:40,970
stopped at the hotel,
drugs with a bottle of wine,

1006
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,200
got a bottle of drugs for you.

1007
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:46,020
Should I send him up?
Seemed like a good move.

1008
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:49,520
And then you know what I did as I 
actually took his car,

1009
00:44:49,521 --> 00:44:50,890
I could hear him in the background go.
No,

1010
00:44:50,891 --> 00:44:51,180
no,
no.

1011
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:53,220
That's okay.
Like he actually was a nice guy,

1012
00:44:53,890 --> 00:44:56,720
but nice enough of a person that would 
do that.

1013
00:44:56,730 --> 00:44:58,780
Wanted to bring a bottle of wine.
That was,

1014
00:44:58,870 --> 00:45:01,890
I think that was her idea.
And so then I started like,

1015
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,960
instead of going,
what the fuck are you talking about?

1016
00:45:03,961 --> 00:45:05,010
I just went,
oh,

1017
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:08,010
okay,
well I'll come down and get it.

1018
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:09,323
And then I came down and met him and,
but it was so unsettling and that was 

1019
00:45:13,981 --> 00:45:15,510
her idea.
It wasn't his idea.

1020
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:19,470
But instead of saying don't do that and 
setting her straight,

1021
00:45:19,471 --> 00:45:20,304
I took the middle road.
And how well did you go back to sleep 

1022
00:45:21,991 --> 00:45:23,200
after that?
Not so good.

1023
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:24,043
Right.
I drank that bottle of wine and had the 

1024
00:45:26,521 --> 00:45:28,530
best show of my life.
I'm over at the show.

1025
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:32,171
Yeah,
that's creepy.

1026
00:45:32,171 --> 00:45:33,080
It's,
um,

1027
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:36,010
Ali Wong has a great bit,
I'm not going to do it justice.

1028
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:38,200
Uh,
and I don't want to paraphrase it either

1029
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:39,730
and I want to tell anybody what it's 
about,

1030
00:45:39,731 --> 00:45:40,564
but it's essentially the difference 
between life for a woman comic on the 

1031
00:45:43,451 --> 00:45:45,420
road versus a white,
young male comic.

1032
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:47,170
You know,
it's a big difference.

1033
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:48,910
Yeah.
The uh,

1034
00:45:48,911 --> 00:45:49,744
the danger level,
like that's like guys that get to get 

1035
00:45:51,761 --> 00:45:53,640
obsessed with you.
You know,

1036
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:57,760
I want to bring you wine shit and like 
that stuff that's gotta be weird.

1037
00:45:58,310 --> 00:46:01,160
I had another guy,
it was the guy who held the sweater.

1038
00:46:01,161 --> 00:46:01,994
He's like,
it's your sweater from season three but 

1039
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:05,273
you want somehow online.
He bought it and then after the show he 

1040
00:46:08,241 --> 00:46:09,650
won.
He showed me,

1041
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:12,050
I don't know what's wrong with me 
because I'm like,

1042
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:15,320
he was a really nice guy.
Like this is a terrible situation,

1043
00:46:15,610 --> 00:46:17,750
but I,
for whatever reason I'm like,

1044
00:46:18,170 --> 00:46:21,530
he needs me to listen to him right now.
And I stood there like,

1045
00:46:21,531 --> 00:46:22,364
what is wrong with me?
He had two thick photo books of the 

1046
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,273
thousands of dollars of memorabilia and 
the pictures of all the items and the 

1047
00:46:30,231 --> 00:46:35,231
itemized of shit from the show.
And again,

1048
00:46:35,451 --> 00:46:36,284
I'm there.
I'm looking around like anybody seeing 

1049
00:46:38,661 --> 00:46:40,100
this,
not just me and him.

1050
00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:40,641
Okay.
Yeah.

1051
00:46:40,641 --> 00:46:43,130
You guys continue cleaning.
Cause that's the weird thing too,

1052
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:47,420
because I'm a superstar on one end,
but on the other end it's like,

1053
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:49,250
not really,
I don't have the money.

1054
00:46:49,251 --> 00:46:51,960
I'm not bringing anyone with me.
I'm right.

1055
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:52,813
You know,
I'm like a regular headliner on the 

1056
00:46:55,041 --> 00:46:55,580
braces.

1057
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:56,810
Do have security though,
right?

1058
00:46:56,811 --> 00:46:58,160
Most places they,
yeah,

1059
00:46:58,161 --> 00:46:59,150
sure.
Yeah.

1060
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:01,640
They just probably weren't aware that 
they should be paying attention.

1061
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:02,230
Yeah,
maybe.

1062
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:03,370
Yeah,
maybe they thought,

1063
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:04,810
yeah,
that's a friend of hers.

1064
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:05,740
That's also a weird thing,
right?

1065
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:06,613
When do you step in?
The guy's got a bunch of books filled 

1066
00:47:08,151 --> 00:47:09,140
with memorabilia.
Okay.

1067
00:47:09,350 --> 00:47:11,110
Like when that seems okay.
Like that doesn't,

1068
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:12,740
it's just a,
he's a very,

1069
00:47:12,741 --> 00:47:14,600
very,
very enthusiastic fans.

1070
00:47:14,601 --> 00:47:15,460
Yes.
But lego,

1071
00:47:15,470 --> 00:47:16,550
what point in time is that right?

1072
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:17,560
Hey,
hey,

1073
00:47:17,561 --> 00:47:18,191
hey,
hey.

1074
00:47:18,191 --> 00:47:18,700
Why don't,
you know,

1075
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:19,533
ultimately,
I'm glad I did it because I feel like I 

1076
00:47:20,711 --> 00:47:22,660
validated him even though I wanted to 
go,

1077
00:47:22,661 --> 00:47:25,060
like,
what happened?

1078
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:29,200
You spent $75,000,
all that stuff like,

1079
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:30,130
but

1080
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:31,210
what can you do?
So it was like,

1081
00:47:31,211 --> 00:47:32,320
that's,
this is great.

1082
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:35,440
Terrific.
You did a really good job.

1083
00:47:35,530 --> 00:47:37,090
She just reached out with a pair of 
scissors.

1084
00:47:37,091 --> 00:47:39,340
This is for you.
And if you're listening,

1085
00:47:39,341 --> 00:47:40,174
you did do a really good job and you 
have a lot of really cool stuff that no 

1086
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:45,280
one else has.
There you go.

1087
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:49,120
And I'm happy for you.
Was it,

1088
00:47:49,121 --> 00:47:49,954
it's always weird when you're a comic 
too and your or your comedian in nature 

1089
00:47:55,450 --> 00:47:56,680
and um,
you,

1090
00:47:56,681 --> 00:47:58,900
you do something that's not comedic,
right?

1091
00:47:59,230 --> 00:48:00,063
Yeah.
Like if you're a comedian and you do a 

1092
00:48:02,021 --> 00:48:05,020
drama show like 24,
it was basically like a drama,

1093
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:08,120
right?
Slas.

1094
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:12,090
What are the most serious shows ever,
ever write super job?

1095
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:13,533
I think I messed up.
I should have just rolled into another 

1096
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:16,803
drama.
I had to open my mouth and show 

1097
00:48:20,471 --> 00:48:24,130
everybody how not the computer genius I 
am like,

1098
00:48:24,131 --> 00:48:25,120
what is wrong with me?

1099
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:25,953
I'm a Wa I've set up obstacles.
You know her from 24 what welcome the 

1100
00:48:30,941 --> 00:48:31,774
comedy stylings of what?
Do you remember what Richard Belzer 

1101
00:48:34,091 --> 00:48:35,020
going on?
Law and order.

1102
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:36,850
Oh yeah.
And everybody was like,

1103
00:48:36,851 --> 00:48:39,190
what?
And then stop being funny.

1104
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:41,710
Like he doesn't do any common anymore.
I don't think,

1105
00:48:42,790 --> 00:48:43,623
I think that should clean up my act.
Should I only be funny now or should I 

1106
00:48:47,501 --> 00:48:51,610
get another drama?
Well I think you should stay funny.

1107
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:53,770
Just be the funny,
just do that.

1108
00:48:54,370 --> 00:48:55,960
Oh,
I never completed this.

1109
00:48:55,961 --> 00:48:58,630
Whatever the story of going through 
being on the road.

1110
00:48:58,631 --> 00:48:59,464
And then coming back to the store and 
thinking like I got it cause I've been 

1111
00:49:02,771 --> 00:49:03,820
on the road.
Right.

1112
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:09,190
Coming back doing the main room,
don't got it at all.

1113
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,113
Dry Mouth,
terrible set guy in the front row is 

1114
00:49:13,511 --> 00:49:18,511
mining falling asleep and mouthing to me
how boring I am because I'm like wow,

1115
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,620
his intense.

1116
00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:23,860
But that's also the beauty of the store 
because you cause you're like,

1117
00:49:23,890 --> 00:49:28,060
oh that was one thing on the road and 
this is another thing.

1118
00:49:28,061 --> 00:49:32,740
Like you got to go deeper and get real.
It's running with a weight vest on.

1119
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:35,080
That's what I describe it.
You can run faster.

1120
00:49:35,081 --> 00:49:36,640
The weight vest on if your legs are 
strong,

1121
00:49:38,290 --> 00:49:40,600
but otherwise you're going to be fucked.
Yeah,

1122
00:49:40,601 --> 00:49:42,260
I love it now.
Yeah,

1123
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:44,290
it's,
it's an intense place.

1124
00:49:44,350 --> 00:49:47,080
I remember you and I were talking about 
something there once,

1125
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:50,290
like fairly recently within the last 
year where you're like,

1126
00:49:50,350 --> 00:49:52,300
I don't know what I'm doing.
Oh yeah.

1127
00:49:52,301 --> 00:49:55,330
I told you I might get the quitting.
I quit.

1128
00:49:55,430 --> 00:49:56,171
What?
Are you serious?

1129
00:49:56,171 --> 00:49:58,360
I couldn't tell if you're serious or 
deadly.

1130
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:03,610
Let's meet every six days or if I take 
more than two days,

1131
00:50:03,611 --> 00:50:05,080
awesome,
I'm done.

1132
00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:10,600
I need to talk to anybody or go anywhere
or do anything.

1133
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:12,310
I'm done.
Like that's my nature.

1134
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:15,340
That's what I fight with.
What brings you back?

1135
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:19,000
What gets you from there to fuck it.
I'll just go do it.

1136
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,033
I just force myself.
But you don't have a hundred percent 

1137
00:50:26,021 --> 00:50:27,710
confidence and your future resolve

1138
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:29,053
like you don't know in the future.
Do you think there's gonna come a time 

1139
00:50:34,491 --> 00:50:36,680
where you just a week turns into a 
month,

1140
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:41,900
turns into a year and then 24 again 
comes on?

1141
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:43,760
We didn't.
They do 24 for the black guy.

1142
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:45,920
Was there a reason?
Is that still okay?

1143
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:47,600
It's still good now.
It's done.

1144
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:50,120
It's done.
I did it with a whole new cast.

1145
00:50:50,510 --> 00:50:53,960
I think it went one season.
Well that's what happens.

1146
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:57,110
Fucking white people.
You ruined it.

1147
00:50:58,490 --> 00:50:59,960
Thanks.
White people,

1148
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:03,680
white people.
He didn't promote it good enough.

1149
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:05,720
You promoted great for Kiefer 
Sutherland.

1150
00:51:06,210 --> 00:51:10,400
I didn't understand what you're getting 
on with that black actor and you fucking

1151
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:13,010
halfass and cancel it before people grew
to love it.

1152
00:51:13,610 --> 00:51:17,030
I think that was a pretty tough act to 
follow.

1153
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:18,830
I'm sure.
Yeah.

1154
00:51:18,831 --> 00:51:20,450
People get angry when you reduce 
something,

1155
00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:21,823
you know,
you call it the same thing like fuck 

1156
00:51:23,121 --> 00:51:23,360
off.

1157
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:25,460
It's not 24 I will come up with another 
name.

1158
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:26,873
Oh yeah.
I think that was the higher world's in 

1159
00:51:28,161 --> 00:51:30,450
trouble.
I like that.

1160
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:31,543
Cool Black Guy.
Who was the guy that played the Corey 

1161
00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:35,930
Hawkins.
Is that right?

1162
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:37,910
I don't know who that gentleman is.
Great.

1163
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,150
They fucked him.
Goddamn white people.

1164
00:51:41,710 --> 00:51:45,860
Fuck Ah,
white people.

1165
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:46,723
That's my take on it.
So are you going to do a specialty 

1166
00:51:49,731 --> 00:51:51,500
thing?
I like to.

1167
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:54,020
I like to.
He should.

1168
00:51:54,210 --> 00:51:55,430
I want,
yes.

1169
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:57,710
I think you're very funny.
Thanks girl.

1170
00:51:58,730 --> 00:51:59,730
I do.
Thank you.

1171
00:51:59,930 --> 00:52:01,520
I do.
I think you're hilarious.

1172
00:52:01,521 --> 00:52:02,900
I'm glad you're doing it.
Still.

1173
00:52:02,930 --> 00:52:05,030
Like when you were telling me that that 
you were going to quit.

1174
00:52:05,031 --> 00:52:05,601
I'm like,
you know,

1175
00:52:05,601 --> 00:52:06,434
you are my angel that night.
You really where you lifted me up from 

1176
00:52:09,261 --> 00:52:10,220
the depths.
I love that.

1177
00:52:10,221 --> 00:52:11,480
You're like,
where are you serious?

1178
00:52:11,481 --> 00:52:15,200
It make no you,
you lifted me up and the depths of hell.

1179
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:18,110
Well,
I could tell you a really down.

1180
00:52:18,111 --> 00:52:19,310
I was like,
that's crazy.

1181
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:20,181
I know,
I know.

1182
00:52:20,181 --> 00:52:23,540
Who's funny.
You're hilarious and you really nice.

1183
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:24,980
You know.
So it was like,

1184
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:28,790
you know,
it's a weird thing to do.

1185
00:52:29,090 --> 00:52:31,700
It's weird thing to do and maybe you 
don't have to.

1186
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:32,960
None of us do it really.
I mean,

1187
00:52:32,961 --> 00:52:34,530
there's gonna come a point in time in my
life for,

1188
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:37,190
I'm probably,
I'm not going to do this anymore,

1189
00:52:38,090 --> 00:52:41,780
but for right now.
But that's cool that you,

1190
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,070
um,
uh,

1191
00:52:43,071 --> 00:52:46,070
pretty love the live show as much as you
do.

1192
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:48,950
It's a struggle I would love.
I really enjoy struggling.

1193
00:52:49,790 --> 00:52:50,623
I do think it's very important.
It's very important for my balance as a 

1194
00:52:53,451 --> 00:52:55,100
person,
especially me,

1195
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:59,890
I have maniacal genetics.
My brain is just constantly,

1196
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:03,710
constantly overrun with things to think 
about and do.

1197
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:06,230
My brain just wants to go,
just come up,

1198
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:06,860
let's go.

1199
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:09,630
We need more fucking stimuli shot.
Let's go.

1200
00:53:09,930 --> 00:53:11,690
There's no to,
we'd always need something.

1201
00:53:11,870 --> 00:53:14,660
So what I do is just stuff it filled 
with information,

1202
00:53:14,870 --> 00:53:15,703
work it out,
get it to run hills and do Jujitsu and 

1203
00:53:18,141 --> 00:53:21,800
yoga and burn that motherfucker out so 
that I could be calm.

1204
00:53:21,801 --> 00:53:22,634
And so what you've lot of what people 
notice today versus how I was like 20 

1205
00:53:26,101 --> 00:53:27,520
years ago is this,
this,

1206
00:53:27,521 --> 00:53:30,690
I understand myself better.
I'm better at managing my,

1207
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:34,110
like whatever are the things that make 
you,

1208
00:53:34,111 --> 00:53:34,944
you,
I'm better at managing those to be very 

1209
00:53:37,501 --> 00:53:38,334
positive,
to just be just overall in my attitude 

1210
00:53:40,721 --> 00:53:43,470
is very different to it's overall just 
nicer to people.

1211
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:48,800
And how did you become nicer?
Just realize that when I'm at my best,

1212
00:53:48,870 --> 00:53:49,703
that's who I am.
And the only variation between that and 

1213
00:53:52,441 --> 00:53:54,630
when I'm at worst.
You weren't nice before?

1214
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:55,650
Yeah,
it was nice.

1215
00:53:55,651 --> 00:53:59,040
I just wasn't as Nice Sam now I've 
always been nice,

1216
00:53:59,490 --> 00:54:01,020
but I've always been nice.
I,

1217
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:04,410
I'm quicker to pull the trigger back 
then.

1218
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:05,251
Right.
You know,

1219
00:54:05,251 --> 00:54:06,480
and I'm,
I'm less

1220
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:08,530
must remember we were at the comedy 
store,

1221
00:54:08,531 --> 00:54:10,300
this is pretty recently.
And uh,

1222
00:54:10,890 --> 00:54:13,000
that guy came into the bathroom when I 
was in there.

1223
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:19,020
You totally pulled like the best male 
like strong guy.

1224
00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:22,210
It was,
it was so good.

1225
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:24,120
Your leg.
Cause I,

1226
00:54:25,070 --> 00:54:29,440
I think the guy was like on coke or a 
combo of something.

1227
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:31,493
And again,
it's like do I not have regard for my 

1228
00:54:33,791 --> 00:54:37,090
own being because a part of me kind of 
left my body and was like,

1229
00:54:37,091 --> 00:54:39,010
wow,
this guy is crazy cause he's like,

1230
00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:40,143
give me a kiss.
And this is like in the women's 

1231
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:42,420
bathroom.
Right,

1232
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:42,881
right,
right,

1233
00:54:42,881 --> 00:54:43,714
right.
And then I think someone that he had 

1234
00:54:44,621 --> 00:54:45,454
done it to someone else,
so it was kind of going around and then 

1235
00:54:46,811 --> 00:54:47,980
I ran into you and I was like,
yeah,

1236
00:54:47,981 --> 00:54:49,150
that just happened to me.
And you were like,

1237
00:54:49,151 --> 00:54:50,770
what?
Where is he?

1238
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:54,130
And you were immediately like,
I'm going to beat his ass.

1239
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:57,280
But simultaneously you were like,
get security to get this guy.

1240
00:54:57,281 --> 00:54:58,120
It was so awesome.

1241
00:54:58,870 --> 00:55:01,750
Well that guy was a creep.
It was so creepy.

1242
00:55:01,870 --> 00:55:04,120
I was upset that I wasn't there as it 
was happening.

1243
00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:06,190
I now,
yeah,

1244
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:09,180
that's unfortunate that you're always 
going to have to,

1245
00:55:09,210 --> 00:55:13,720
I rarely like enjoy or or that like that

1246
00:55:13,930 --> 00:55:15,190
bonds that you had.
I was like,

1247
00:55:15,610 --> 00:55:16,443
that was awesome.
I like that as you rarely can be a lady 

1248
00:55:19,901 --> 00:55:24,901
after all.
I just don't know how to do it.

1249
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:27,010
Well.
I miss the boat,

1250
00:55:27,070 --> 00:55:27,903
but I

1251
00:55:28,510 --> 00:55:33,510
only reason why you can enjoy it is 
because it is in stark contrast to how I

1252
00:55:33,851 --> 00:55:37,840
behave when people are nice.
So you realize there's a difference,

1253
00:55:37,870 --> 00:55:40,090
right?
It's like it's break class,

1254
00:55:40,150 --> 00:55:43,870
break glass in case of emergency,
you know that was an emergency.

1255
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:44,704
Like this is a real creep.
It's cool to see that coked up assholes 

1256
00:55:49,170 --> 00:55:52,090
at that fucking store.
Lately there's so many coked up.

1257
00:55:52,091 --> 00:55:55,090
Weirdos cook must be making a comeback 
and Hollywood,

1258
00:55:55,091 --> 00:55:58,690
it must be kind of like put my blinders 
on to it probably.

1259
00:55:58,730 --> 00:55:59,563
Sure.
There's a lot of people with fucking 

1260
00:56:01,270 --> 00:56:03,910
bright eyes and ideas and business 
plans.

1261
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:05,430
They want to fucking

1262
00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:06,720
pitch away.
That's what I need.

1263
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:08,610
If you're the overactive,
I'm the opposite.

1264
00:56:08,611 --> 00:56:10,170
Like if I see a bed out of the corner of
mine,

1265
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:11,130
I'm like,
ah,

1266
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:15,570
that can be great right now.
Like that's my avoidance tactic.

1267
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:17,580
Just like this.
Got To sleep.

1268
00:56:18,090 --> 00:56:19,100
Yeah,
I can't do that.

1269
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:22,280
Does work.
I just lie there and think,

1270
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:24,100
but my sort of route

1271
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:27,130
of the discovering like my hidden anger 
core,

1272
00:56:27,131 --> 00:56:28,240
I'm like,
oh,

1273
00:56:28,241 --> 00:56:30,340
like peeling off the layers of like,
oh,

1274
00:56:30,341 --> 00:56:32,020
she's uncomfortable,
she's quiet,

1275
00:56:32,021 --> 00:56:33,400
she doesn't react.
And it's like,

1276
00:56:33,450 --> 00:56:33,710
oh no,
no,

1277
00:56:33,710 --> 00:56:34,810
no,
they're in there.

1278
00:56:34,811 --> 00:56:38,500
You've just buried them like all of your
feelings in like politeness.

1279
00:56:38,550 --> 00:56:41,170
And so that's comedy has helped me with 
that too.

1280
00:56:41,171 --> 00:56:44,170
Cause I early on I was like way too 
reactive.

1281
00:56:44,171 --> 00:56:45,070
I'd be like,
Oh,

1282
00:56:45,071 --> 00:56:46,810
what do you think?
Like talking to an audience member,

1283
00:56:46,811 --> 00:56:47,410
it's like,
no,

1284
00:56:47,410 --> 00:56:50,290
you're in control.
Like you tell them where it's going,

1285
00:56:50,291 --> 00:56:52,360
you steer it like yes,
you can listen to it.

1286
00:56:52,361 --> 00:56:54,890
But um,
so that's,

1287
00:56:54,970 --> 00:56:55,803
it's teaching me that as well.
How to like drive the train instead of 

1288
00:57:00,461 --> 00:57:01,294
like,
I'm going to be open to you and listen 

1289
00:57:03,221 --> 00:57:05,500
and go wherever you want me to go,
you know,

1290
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:09,010
and just react to you.
There's also like,

1291
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:09,993
there's a weird feedback loop thing 
going on there because people like it 

1292
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:14,500
when you go,
oh well what do you think?

1293
00:57:14,810 --> 00:57:15,643
So you liked the fact that they liked 
that you do that and then you avoid the 

1294
00:57:19,241 --> 00:57:20,074
conflict that way,
but then you have to swallow it for the 

1295
00:57:22,121 --> 00:57:23,050
rest of the day.
It was,

1296
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:25,150
you know,
he's totally,

1297
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:30,650
that's true.
Yeah.

1298
00:57:31,530 --> 00:57:35,370
Well I mean it's like I said,
like being a person and being a comic,

1299
00:57:35,371 --> 00:57:38,190
very similar in that you're never done.
There's never done.

1300
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:40,530
You know,
you're always trying to fix that thing.

1301
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:42,810
Was trying to tweak it,
make it a little better.

1302
00:57:43,830 --> 00:57:44,663
And then that's like one of the big 
arguments for writing new material to 

1303
00:57:48,691 --> 00:57:51,000
the idea is that every time you write a 
new act,

1304
00:57:51,390 --> 00:57:54,300
especially when you have to like really 
so special or something like that,

1305
00:57:54,510 --> 00:57:55,800
you're going to be better.
Cause you,

1306
00:57:55,801 --> 00:57:58,140
you understand comedy better than you 
did two years ago.

1307
00:57:58,230 --> 00:57:59,063
You're just going to be better.
If you've really been paying attention 

1308
00:58:01,770 --> 00:58:03,330
and you really are looking at it 
correctly,

1309
00:58:03,331 --> 00:58:05,400
you're going to be better.
But God,

1310
00:58:05,401 --> 00:58:07,020
it's so hard cause you right.
You want to avoid it.

1311
00:58:07,021 --> 00:58:08,340
You want to go to that bed.
It's right there.

1312
00:58:08,970 --> 00:58:09,810
It's right there in radio land.

1313
00:58:12,470 --> 00:58:14,150
CHICAGO,
Zee.

1314
00:58:17,130 --> 00:58:18,210
Hello.
Oh,

1315
00:58:18,211 --> 00:58:20,500
you get your pets in the bed with you?
Oh yeah.

1316
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:22,530
They keep 'em out.
Cause my allergies.

1317
00:58:22,531 --> 00:58:26,790
But then when they surround me,
what are you allergic to?

1318
00:58:27,330 --> 00:58:29,520
Everything.
Do you have any cats and dogs and you're

1319
00:58:29,521 --> 00:58:30,510
allergic to them?
Yeah,

1320
00:58:30,511 --> 00:58:33,000
my husband got the cat.
That's what put it over the edge.

1321
00:58:33,001 --> 00:58:35,940
I had two dogs for the longest time and 
I ignored it.

1322
00:58:35,941 --> 00:58:36,774
And then it's the weather and the cat 
and I just went over this edge where I 

1323
00:58:39,271 --> 00:58:43,350
always had like this really bad cold.
And then I finally had to go and I tried

1324
00:58:43,351 --> 00:58:48,150
to all the organic things and I finally 
had to go and get the like twice a week.

1325
00:58:48,151 --> 00:58:48,984
But when they tested it,
it was like everything just like paper 

1326
00:58:51,811 --> 00:58:55,320
and pollen and pets and a paper.
You're allergic to paper.

1327
00:58:55,350 --> 00:58:56,790
Yeah.
Wow.

1328
00:58:57,660 --> 00:58:58,493
Uh,
but then I got those shots twice a week 

1329
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:03,060
and with the shots do I kind of Miss My 
allergist?

1330
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:05,110
We would have little four minute chats.
Uh,

1331
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:09,420
it's like you're an ocular rating,
so you start doing a little bit and then

1332
00:59:09,421 --> 00:59:13,020
you build up your tolerance so they can 
inoculate you for cat dander.

1333
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:14,940
Real.
Yeah.

1334
00:59:14,941 --> 00:59:18,540
That's sort of an allergy shot is I 
didn't even know that there were allergy

1335
00:59:18,541 --> 00:59:19,650
shots.
Yeah.

1336
00:59:19,651 --> 00:59:21,090
And He,
it's like a little cocktail,

1337
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:22,063
like all the things cocktail for me of 
all the things that I'm allergic to and 

1338
00:59:25,851 --> 00:59:29,300
then I just build up my tolerance.
Wow.

1339
00:59:29,390 --> 00:59:31,160
So now if you're around a cat and 
nothing,

1340
00:59:31,370 --> 00:59:32,930
yeah,
I cuddled him.

1341
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:35,000
No Shit.
We make out.

1342
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:36,583
Yeah.
And it used to be if a cat just like 

1343
00:59:39,411 --> 00:59:41,570
licked you or touched your hand or 
something like that,

1344
00:59:41,571 --> 00:59:43,610
you would get like little,
little rub.

1345
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:45,220
A little red area.
Yeah.

1346
00:59:45,710 --> 00:59:46,610
Or like,
yeah.

1347
00:59:46,611 --> 00:59:47,930
Inflamed.
Yeah.

1348
00:59:47,931 --> 00:59:49,430
One of my daughters is allergic to cats.

1349
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:51,920
We had to figure it out.
It took a while.

1350
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:55,010
She'd like wake up with puffy eyes and 
then we got a tested and realized it was

1351
00:59:55,011 --> 00:59:56,630
a cat.
So what'd you do?

1352
00:59:56,631 --> 00:59:58,100
She takes a pill?
No,

1353
00:59:58,160 --> 00:59:59,490
no,
the cat went to,

1354
00:59:59,491 --> 01:00:00,380
uh,
my other daughter,

1355
01:00:00,381 --> 01:00:01,650
my oldest daughter.
Okay.

1356
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:03,200
So she's got it.
Her apartment,

1357
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:04,273
I used to be allergic to feathers.
I remember sleeping over someone's 

1358
01:00:06,261 --> 01:00:09,290
house.
It depends on like where my system is of

1359
01:00:09,291 --> 01:00:11,090
how it affects me sometimes.
Yeah.

1360
01:00:11,091 --> 01:00:12,890
Like the other pillow.
Yeah.

1361
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:14,090
Yeah.
Whoa.

1362
01:00:15,650 --> 01:00:19,040
I know people that are allergic to like,
like Styrofoam.

1363
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:22,610
I've heard of people who are allergic to
like certain types of plastic and shit.

1364
01:00:23,150 --> 01:00:23,983
Yeah.
Just coming in contact with certain 

1365
01:00:25,101 --> 01:00:28,270
plastics,
make them break out my,

1366
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:31,040
my making this up,
it feels like bullshit.

1367
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:33,930
I got the Epi pen once.
Whoa.

1368
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:36,860
From getting the shots.
That was really exciting.

1369
01:00:37,310 --> 01:00:40,160
So you got the shots,
your body went into shock because of all

1370
01:00:40,161 --> 01:00:40,994
the allergic shots.
And then they had a fucking boom right 

1371
01:00:43,081 --> 01:00:44,660
in the thigh.
And My allergist was like,

1372
01:00:45,050 --> 01:00:46,850
he did it in my arm and he,
he said,

1373
01:00:46,851 --> 01:00:47,684
I didn't even raise it that much,
but I went home and I was reading and 

1374
01:00:50,091 --> 01:00:51,140
I'm like,
God,

1375
01:00:51,141 --> 01:00:52,890
I itchy.
Oh,

1376
01:00:53,170 --> 01:00:55,220
I must,
I must have been sweating.

1377
01:00:55,221 --> 01:00:59,000
Like I worked out and I need to,
I didn't for like a full 10 minutes.

1378
01:00:59,090 --> 01:01:01,370
I wasn't conscious.
I was just subconsciously gone.

1379
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:02,413
Man.
I gotta go take a shower or something 

1380
01:01:03,621 --> 01:01:08,621
and then I lift it up and it was like 
traveling and then I just was like,

1381
01:01:10,550 --> 01:01:12,860
I'm having a attack.
Like I need a Benadryl.

1382
01:01:12,861 --> 01:01:14,600
And like no one was listening to me and 
I'm like,

1383
01:01:14,601 --> 01:01:15,850
Hey,
I think I need a Benadryl.

1384
01:01:15,870 --> 01:01:16,790
And I,
I didn't,

1385
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:19,850
I was looking for the Benadryl,
couldn't find it.

1386
01:01:20,090 --> 01:01:21,950
Called my allergist.
And he goes,

1387
01:01:22,010 --> 01:01:24,440
yeah,
I just come here right now.

1388
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:25,813
And then I drove there just like so 
scared cause I could feel it traveling 

1389
01:01:29,691 --> 01:01:31,230
and I'm like,
you know,

1390
01:01:31,370 --> 01:01:32,203
panicking but also trying to like manage
like when you panic and it's a good 

1391
01:01:35,481 --> 01:01:37,640
thing because you have to act fast.
And then I thought,

1392
01:01:37,930 --> 01:01:40,490
are my eyes going to close up?
Is my throat going to close up?

1393
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:45,470
And then went in there full on Epi pen.
It's awesome.

1394
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:47,630
It was really good.
It felt like,

1395
01:01:48,890 --> 01:01:51,650
it honestly felt like I was about to go 
onstage.

1396
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:53,180
Ooh,
like a rush.

1397
01:01:53,250 --> 01:01:56,090
Yeah,
it was kind of great feeling,

1398
01:01:56,210 --> 01:02:00,500
but it's almost like it like feels like 
tinny and like real trevally like,

1399
01:02:00,970 --> 01:02:05,700
like you get like for a few seconds and 
trevally bless Augusta.

1400
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:10,220
Yeah,
like not even caffeine,

1401
01:02:10,221 --> 01:02:11,930
like beyond caffeine,
but,

1402
01:02:11,990 --> 01:02:13,700
but yeah,
like a pure,

1403
01:02:13,701 --> 01:02:14,534
a dry,
it felt like a real exciting standup 

1404
01:02:17,481 --> 01:02:18,310
show.
Wow.

1405
01:02:18,310 --> 01:02:20,250
I'm really excited to go on stage

1406
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:21,083
right now.
And that immediately stops the allergic 

1407
01:02:22,831 --> 01:02:23,664
reaction.
Yeah.

1408
01:02:23,850 --> 01:02:25,530
Wow.
That's incredible.

1409
01:02:27,020 --> 01:02:28,350
What do you got it?
That's what it is.

1410
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:31,530
The EPI pen is adrenaline.
Oh Wow.

1411
01:02:31,531 --> 01:02:34,200
That's a crazy,
I've done that on an episode of 24 where

1412
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:37,680
the character dies and the Epi pen in 
the heart and they wake back up.

1413
01:02:37,830 --> 01:02:41,550
So epinephrin is adrenaline.
Wow.

1414
01:02:41,580 --> 01:02:42,930
It was awesome.
I liked it.

1415
01:02:42,990 --> 01:02:45,870
I wouldn't do it every day if I could.
You should do it every day.

1416
01:02:46,170 --> 01:02:48,990
It's a hormone,
neurotransmitter and medication.

1417
01:02:48,991 --> 01:02:49,824
Epinephrin is normally produced,
but both of your dream of glands and 

1418
01:02:52,561 --> 01:02:53,394
certain neurons plays an important role.
The fight or flight response by 

1419
01:02:56,461 --> 01:02:59,940
increasing blood flow to the muscles 
output or the heart trouble feel.

1420
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:02,820
Oh Wow.
Pupil dilation.

1421
01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:04,283
Wow.
And then then other stuff that you get 

1422
01:03:06,601 --> 01:03:08,370
from luck,
cold shock proteins.

1423
01:03:08,371 --> 01:03:10,350
That's norepinephrine.
Is that what it is?

1424
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:14,210
That's the way that Doctor Rhonda 
Patrick was a,

1425
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:19,220
she's a giant proponent of a sauna and 
also of cryotherapy.

1426
01:03:19,650 --> 01:03:24,350
And she was talking about the benefits 
of cold shock proteins.

1427
01:03:24,351 --> 01:03:25,650
And one of them is,
uh,

1428
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:28,800
your body freaks out when you go into 
those cryotherapy chambers,

1429
01:03:28,801 --> 01:03:29,634
cause it's like 250 degrees below zero.
So you get this big powerful burst of 

1430
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:36,660
norepinephrine.
You get cold shock proteins.

1431
01:03:36,661 --> 01:03:37,494
These sidechains cause your body's 
trying to react to the fact that you 

1432
01:03:39,241 --> 01:03:42,660
have this massive cold environment that 
you're just trapped in.

1433
01:03:42,661 --> 01:03:43,494
It's like so fucking cold.
Your body freaks out and it produces 

1434
01:03:45,961 --> 01:03:48,840
this really radical anti inflammation 
process.

1435
01:03:50,010 --> 01:03:51,590
And one of them is this stuff.
Okay.

1436
01:03:51,591 --> 01:03:54,190
And that's as a trend that known also 
known as noradrenaline.

1437
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:55,130
Oh,
it's also,

1438
01:03:55,130 --> 01:03:57,270
no,
because adrenaline is epinephrine.

1439
01:03:57,480 --> 01:04:00,630
Okay.
So nor epinephrin that it makes you feel

1440
01:04:00,631 --> 01:04:01,464
so good.
It's like one of the reasons why I 

1441
01:04:02,791 --> 01:04:05,760
really liked going to the cryo chamber 
just to get out,

1442
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:07,380
get out.
Yeah.

1443
01:04:07,381 --> 01:04:08,040
You get out,
you're like,

1444
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:08,873
whoa.

1445
01:04:11,090 --> 01:04:11,923
Putting your body under stress and then 
it releases that Doctor Rhonda Patrick 

1446
01:04:17,701 --> 01:04:20,070
is also a big proponent of that in the 
sauna.

1447
01:04:20,071 --> 01:04:21,840
And that's why I installed that sauna 
here.

1448
01:04:22,290 --> 01:04:24,120
Call it a protein.
Yeah.

1449
01:04:24,121 --> 01:04:24,954
Heat shock proteins.
He chocked proteins and cold shock 

1450
01:04:26,701 --> 01:04:27,534
proteins.
So proteins that are produced by your 

1451
01:04:29,011 --> 01:04:32,610
body to deal with the effects of extreme
heat or cold.

1452
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:37,080
See your body reacts to stress.
Too much heat will kill you for sure.

1453
01:04:37,081 --> 01:04:37,914
Too much cold will kill you for sure.
But a little bit is actually very good 

1454
01:04:40,441 --> 01:04:41,274
for you because your body has a response
to that and that response sort of 

1455
01:04:44,371 --> 01:04:45,204
invigorates your entire system,
kind of speaks to what you're talking 

1456
01:04:47,821 --> 01:04:48,654
about performing and a ceiling stressing
yourself going through that stress in 

1457
01:04:53,071 --> 01:04:55,450
order to,
um,

1458
01:04:56,580 --> 01:04:57,413
yeah,
I listened to a chunk of that ell and 

1459
01:04:59,490 --> 01:05:00,900
um,
Joey Diaz.

1460
01:05:01,590 --> 01:05:02,790
Yeah.
Which by the way,

1461
01:05:02,791 --> 01:05:05,260
it was amazing the way you guys 
communicate it.

1462
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:06,650
That was like,
it's pretty cool.

1463
01:05:06,980 --> 01:05:07,813
Uh,
but the,

1464
01:05:07,860 --> 01:05:08,693
yeah,
the,

1465
01:05:08,850 --> 01:05:11,810
the pyramid of athletics.
Yeah.

1466
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:13,770
Every day.
And you're living there.

1467
01:05:13,771 --> 01:05:16,410
It just made me think about my own life,
which you know,

1468
01:05:16,411 --> 01:05:17,244
my parents really hard to like make me 
comfortable and here's your TV and you 

1469
01:05:21,521 --> 01:05:22,354
go to school and you come home from 
school and how that's the goal in like 

1470
01:05:27,011 --> 01:05:30,580
suburban life is to just be coffee 
counter ball.

1471
01:05:31,090 --> 01:05:33,730
We don't realize it,
but this is all because people before us

1472
01:05:33,731 --> 01:05:36,700
weren't we just only living in the 
environment where people are supposed to

1473
01:05:36,701 --> 01:05:38,140
be comfortable,
but you know,

1474
01:05:38,141 --> 01:05:38,974
just two generations back,
everyone's an immigrant and everyone's 

1475
01:05:40,751 --> 01:05:43,360
really concerned about starving,
so I have to do,

1476
01:05:43,420 --> 01:05:46,120
go back to the 1920s everyone's worried 
about fucking dying.

1477
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:47,073
There were millions of people died.
Like even during World War Two millions 

1478
01:05:50,381 --> 01:05:54,370
of people died by starvation.
That was a real concern.

1479
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:55,900
I remember you saying to him,
you're like,

1480
01:05:55,901 --> 01:05:57,010
yeah,
it produced,

1481
01:05:57,100 --> 01:05:57,933
it produces really good athletes.
It might not be like the nicest 

1482
01:06:01,571 --> 01:06:02,404
situation,
but there's no way you get really nice 

1483
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:08,470
situations that produced the world's 
best combat sports athletes just doesn't

1484
01:06:08,471 --> 01:06:11,530
happen.
You have to be strong as fuck mentally,

1485
01:06:11,531 --> 01:06:12,364
physically.
You have to have experienced adversity 

1486
01:06:14,441 --> 01:06:15,274
on a level that most people can never 
comprehend so that when the shit hits 

1487
01:06:17,861 --> 01:06:18,694
the fan that you could look at the other
guy on the other side of the cage like 

1488
01:06:22,151 --> 01:06:22,984
Yoel Romero does and goes,
I'm going to go fuck you up cause I've 

1489
01:06:25,901 --> 01:06:30,130
been through everything already.
Even then the other guys the same way so

1490
01:06:30,170 --> 01:06:31,540
he doesn't even work.
Yeah,

1491
01:06:31,541 --> 01:06:32,374
I don't really relate to that.
Like China fuck up the other dude and 

1492
01:06:35,441 --> 01:06:38,180
going through so much adversity.
Well I,

1493
01:06:38,190 --> 01:06:40,360
well I'm,
my point of view is like,

1494
01:06:40,990 --> 01:06:44,200
I'm going to do my chores and I'm so 
comfortable right now.

1495
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:47,950
Now I'm going to deliberately make 
myself uncomfortable in order to do what

1496
01:06:47,951 --> 01:06:48,784
I know is good for me and that I enjoy 
doing and that I want to have success 

1497
01:06:52,331 --> 01:06:54,160
in.
And that takes me to another place in my

1498
01:06:54,161 --> 01:06:55,180
life.
But it's,

1499
01:06:55,810 --> 01:06:59,290
you know,
I do it in a very small way.

1500
01:06:59,320 --> 01:06:59,921
You know,
you do,

1501
01:06:59,921 --> 01:07:02,200
but it's still really honestly the same 
thing.

1502
01:07:02,530 --> 01:07:05,050
What [inaudible] is doing and what 
you're doing is the same thing.

1503
01:07:05,260 --> 01:07:08,320
You're doing something very difficult 
that you,

1504
01:07:08,321 --> 01:07:09,880
it's,
you struggle to do it.

1505
01:07:10,090 --> 01:07:13,720
It's hard.
You push yourself visit [inaudible] want

1506
01:07:13,721 --> 01:07:17,140
to do it and in through doing it you get
a little bit better at everything.

1507
01:07:17,290 --> 01:07:20,290
Did he talk about,
I only watched the first chunk of it.

1508
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:21,193
Uh,
did he talk about his desire to do that 

1509
01:07:23,441 --> 01:07:24,520
or not?
Yeah.

1510
01:07:24,521 --> 01:07:26,270
Like yeah.
Yeah,

1511
01:07:26,271 --> 01:07:27,520
he dead.
And how does that,

1512
01:07:27,610 --> 01:07:31,480
how does that match with kind of being 
put in that system?

1513
01:07:31,870 --> 01:07:35,680
I think you asked that early on too was 
like how do they choose,

1514
01:07:35,740 --> 01:07:38,350
how do you choose?
Is it just want someone who has what?

1515
01:07:38,351 --> 01:07:41,320
If you have the natural ability but you 
don't want to do it,

1516
01:07:41,530 --> 01:07:43,630
well then you won't perform.
And if you don't perform,

1517
01:07:43,631 --> 01:07:45,910
you get knocked out of the system.
There is the desire.

1518
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:48,820
It does,
it has to be to be as good as he is.

1519
01:07:48,821 --> 01:07:51,880
There has to be desire to compete.
He wanted to be a boxer initially said,

1520
01:07:52,060 --> 01:07:52,893
but his father was a boxer.
I think his brother is a world champion 

1521
01:07:55,841 --> 01:07:59,500
boxer as well.
He's just a genetic for reek.

1522
01:07:59,950 --> 01:08:03,250
Like there's genetics and Cuba,
and he was explaining it to me too.

1523
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:04,720
He's during the podcast,
he was like,

1524
01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:08,030
anybody that thinks that everyone's on 
steroids just go to Cuba where everybody

1525
01:08:08,031 --> 01:08:09,970
is so poor and look at the regular 
people,

1526
01:08:10,090 --> 01:08:10,900
just the regular people.

1527
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:12,760
Forget about the athletes.
He said,

1528
01:08:12,790 --> 01:08:14,680
I'll take you to Cuba for two weeks and 
you'll come back.

1529
01:08:14,681 --> 01:08:15,514
You're like,
I get it.

1530
01:08:15,950 --> 01:08:17,480
I get it.
There's just really,

1531
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:18,970
it was a slave colony.
They,

1532
01:08:19,060 --> 01:08:21,080
they had a hard life.
I mean it's,

1533
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:21,933
it's,
that's their Africans that speaks 

1534
01:08:23,351 --> 01:08:26,690
Spanish and they live on an island 
that's off the coast of Florida.

1535
01:08:26,930 --> 01:08:28,100
I mean,
it's a crazy spot.

1536
01:08:28,220 --> 01:08:29,053
The whole thing is crazy.
It was run by a dictator forever and 

1537
01:08:31,041 --> 01:08:33,650
they had some of the best athletes in 
the world in boxing,

1538
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:34,633
in judo and wrestling,
just world class athletes that had 

1539
01:08:38,811 --> 01:08:40,430
mental toughness.
The likes of,

1540
01:08:40,820 --> 01:08:41,653
I mean it's hard for the average person 
even comprehend with those people are 

1541
01:08:44,211 --> 01:08:45,044
capable of,
and a lot of it is because of that 

1542
01:08:46,581 --> 01:08:49,070
really brutal system that you all talked
about on the podcast.

1543
01:08:49,071 --> 01:08:50,900
Amazing stuff.
Amazing.

1544
01:08:51,140 --> 01:08:52,160
You know,
just,

1545
01:08:52,370 --> 01:08:54,770
just imagining that this guy went 
through that,

1546
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:57,560
you know,
it's fascinating because that's not what

1547
01:08:57,650 --> 01:08:58,190
I want to do.

1548
01:08:58,190 --> 01:08:59,400
It's not what you want to do,
right.

1549
01:08:59,401 --> 01:09:03,260
But you just think like that there's a 
person out there that can do that.

1550
01:09:03,261 --> 01:09:07,250
And look what happens on the other end.
You get that guy like Jesus.

1551
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:09,680
He was just being in the room with him.
It's just,

1552
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:13,700
he's like a fucking superhero.
It's like cheese us that,

1553
01:09:13,730 --> 01:09:17,450
that is the product of genetics,
ruthless training,

1554
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:19,160
ruthless environment.
You know,

1555
01:09:19,161 --> 01:09:23,450
one of the most complex and 
sophisticated sports training systems in

1556
01:09:23,451 --> 01:09:27,020
the world with boxing and with wrestling
and with Judah.

1557
01:09:27,021 --> 01:09:28,700
I mean they're just phenomenal over 
there.

1558
01:09:28,930 --> 01:09:30,380
It was cool.
It was really inspiring.

1559
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:32,780
It's amazing for way for someone like 
me,

1560
01:09:32,781 --> 01:09:37,781
like I don't relate necessarily to what 
he does is like foreign and amazing.

1561
01:09:38,481 --> 01:09:40,730
But through my own life it's like,
oh,

1562
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:41,833
I can be not comfortable.
And that's why it seems like a 

1563
01:09:45,891 --> 01:09:46,724
contradiction,
but it's not like that's what we're 

1564
01:09:48,861 --> 01:09:51,020
supposed to be doing.

1565
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:54,410
Um,
and when you get through that you have a

1566
01:09:54,411 --> 01:09:57,440
sense of satisfaction and then it feels 
bad.

1567
01:09:57,441 --> 01:10:02,441
It wasn't something that was introduced 
to me or taught to me really.

1568
01:10:03,230 --> 01:10:05,180
I mean,
I did sports a little bit.

1569
01:10:05,210 --> 01:10:07,070
Did you figure it out just through the 
pursuit?

1570
01:10:07,790 --> 01:10:08,510
Yeah,
I don't,

1571
01:10:08,510 --> 01:10:13,510
there was nothing that I really 
committed to that much or knew how to,

1572
01:10:13,881 --> 01:10:16,430
or if I did it was maybe one small 
aspect.

1573
01:10:16,431 --> 01:10:19,610
It wasn't really a thing.
It was,

1574
01:10:19,611 --> 01:10:20,444
you know,
the messaging was try to get by and try 

1575
01:10:22,851 --> 01:10:26,030
to try to get some shitty job,
you know,

1576
01:10:26,031 --> 01:10:28,150
it wasn't,
um,

1577
01:10:29,540 --> 01:10:30,960
it's weird because you know,
at the not,

1578
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:33,620
not like woe is me,
but like just knowing the,

1579
01:10:33,621 --> 01:10:38,621
even that you had choices that you could
try to beat something great.

1580
01:10:40,380 --> 01:10:45,380
That wasn't really something that was 
discussed or on the table.

1581
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:48,980
Well wasn't that does not,
that's one aspect of all comedy.

1582
01:10:49,010 --> 01:10:53,930
Like they're not a lot of people that 
talk about success or the process of,

1583
01:10:54,170 --> 01:10:56,810
it's more of like playing everything low
key.

1584
01:10:57,020 --> 01:11:00,500
Right.
Or like a sarcasm or a,

1585
01:11:01,580 --> 01:11:04,270
it's not like that's the sincerity.
Yes,

1586
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:04,820
yes,
yes.

1587
01:11:04,820 --> 01:11:07,430
Of being a hipster is that you've got 
that distance.

1588
01:11:07,431 --> 01:11:08,264
You're not really,
that's why I love the comedy store as 

1589
01:11:10,191 --> 01:11:13,040
well because it's like the opposite.
It's the opposite.

1590
01:11:13,050 --> 01:11:13,883
It's like what's your thing?
And every been super honest and open 

1591
01:11:17,071 --> 01:11:17,904
about like bombings and good sets and 
bad sets and jokes had just fell right 

1592
01:11:22,051 --> 01:11:22,884
in their face like that back bar area.
So brutal with the people who just come 

1593
01:11:26,311 --> 01:11:27,001
back there and go,
oh,

1594
01:11:27,001 --> 01:11:28,530
I just ate a fat,
played a shit.

1595
01:11:29,250 --> 01:11:32,190
Like people are just so honest about it 
when they come downstairs,

1596
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:35,280
you know,
it's great place.

1597
01:11:36,090 --> 01:11:38,100
I feel super fortunate in it.
Yeah,

1598
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:40,560
I missed it so much coming back.

1599
01:11:40,890 --> 01:11:43,710
I mean there's a place for that.
Sarcasm and the,

1600
01:11:43,711 --> 01:11:44,544
and the,
sure Thomson [inaudible] does that all 

1601
01:11:46,651 --> 01:11:48,210
the time,
but he's also sincere as well.

1602
01:11:48,230 --> 01:11:49,080
Yeah,
there's a,

1603
01:11:49,081 --> 01:11:51,900
there's a thing that's a,
it's an insecurity.

1604
01:11:52,130 --> 01:11:55,050
Um,
it's like a defense mechanism and that's

1605
01:11:55,051 --> 01:11:57,990
what a lot of people do it for.
They pretend they're above it all,

1606
01:11:58,200 --> 01:11:59,490
but no one's above it all,
man.

1607
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:00,960
You can't,
don't pretend you're above it all.

1608
01:12:00,961 --> 01:12:02,610
It's ridiculous.
You can do it for fun.

1609
01:12:02,850 --> 01:12:03,683
But pretending you're actually above it 
all you're missing out like nobody 

1610
01:12:06,121 --> 01:12:07,890
believes you.
First of all,

1611
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:09,630
it's like pretending you're psychic.
Are you ho?

1612
01:12:09,660 --> 01:12:11,940
You know magic.
Nobody fucking believes you.

1613
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:13,020
All right,
so you keep down,

1614
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:13,853
act going,
keep your fucking fake mustache on your 

1615
01:12:15,511 --> 01:12:18,450
Cape and your top hat.
I feel that's like,

1616
01:12:18,510 --> 01:12:21,540
that's silly.
Like it's doing it occasionally.

1617
01:12:21,541 --> 01:12:24,120
Every now and then it's fun.
We all do it to each other all the time,

1618
01:12:24,390 --> 01:12:28,350
but if you have a complete lack of 
ability to communicate sincerely,

1619
01:12:28,351 --> 01:12:30,640
that's not being hip or cool,
right?

1620
01:12:30,690 --> 01:12:31,523
That's a defense mechanism and it's a 
stupid one because you don't have much 

1621
01:12:34,231 --> 01:12:36,000
time.
You have a hundred years.

1622
01:12:36,001 --> 01:12:37,420
If you're lucky,
they'll go,

1623
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:38,333
they go by like that.
If you have $100 you spend a dollar a 

1624
01:12:40,771 --> 01:12:42,450
day before you know what?
You're fucking broke.

1625
01:12:42,660 --> 01:12:43,493
That's life.

1626
01:12:43,610 --> 01:12:45,230
My son was like,
where did Michael,

1627
01:12:45,350 --> 01:12:46,970
how old was Michael Jackson when he 
died?

1628
01:12:46,971 --> 01:12:47,750
I was like,
ah.

1629
01:12:47,750 --> 01:12:49,670
In his fifties he was like,
oh,

1630
01:12:49,730 --> 01:12:50,750
okay.
Like that.

1631
01:12:50,751 --> 01:12:52,490
Like that sounded right to him.
I'm like,

1632
01:12:52,590 --> 01:12:54,710
ah.
People don't die until much,

1633
01:12:55,680 --> 01:12:57,160
basically.
That's me.

1634
01:12:57,670 --> 01:12:59,560
Well,
Michael Jackson's a craziest case of all

1635
01:12:59,561 --> 01:13:00,011
time,
right.

1636
01:13:00,011 --> 01:13:00,844
Cause he was giving him,
they was in administering anesthesia 

1637
01:13:02,891 --> 01:13:05,410
every night so we can go to sleep.
Dude,

1638
01:13:05,890 --> 01:13:06,723
I was playing that.
I was playing a want to be starting 

1639
01:13:08,801 --> 01:13:10,050
something and uh,

1640
01:13:11,130 --> 01:13:11,963
thriller in the car on the way,
taking my son to school and I start 

1641
01:13:15,151 --> 01:13:19,440
crying just because it's like,
how do you explain

1642
01:13:20,410 --> 01:13:23,800
what he was and how monumental,

1643
01:13:24,930 --> 01:13:25,763
what he did was like,
I can remember seeing him dancing the 

1644
01:13:28,351 --> 01:13:33,351
Billie Jean and like how kind of like 
broke the mold for music and the persona

1645
01:13:35,310 --> 01:13:37,560
that he had and that level of 
creativity.

1646
01:13:38,390 --> 01:13:40,490
Um,
yeah,

1647
01:13:40,491 --> 01:13:41,324
it was weird to be in the car with us,
with my kid who doesn't really know the 

1648
01:13:45,501 --> 01:13:46,790
name but didn't,
you know?

1649
01:13:47,140 --> 01:13:48,860
Right.
It's just,

1650
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:52,010
that's not part of his life.
That's not part of his life.

1651
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:54,830
Maybe she introduced him to that movie,
that documentary.

1652
01:13:54,940 --> 01:13:58,250
Was that the one documentary that did 
this is it?

1653
01:13:58,310 --> 01:13:59,540
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

1654
01:13:59,610 --> 01:14:03,590
Yeah.
Does that get into the drugs and stuff?

1655
01:14:04,010 --> 01:14:05,660
And how many years was he doing it for?
So,

1656
01:14:05,690 --> 01:14:07,520
so sad.
Not Very Long,

1657
01:14:07,700 --> 01:14:09,310
but here's one of the more fucked up 
things is,

1658
01:14:09,311 --> 01:14:11,680
this is something I speculated a long 
time ago.

1659
01:14:12,190 --> 01:14:13,023
His doctor who went to jail for giving 
him the anesthesia also testified that 

1660
01:14:17,351 --> 01:14:18,184
Michael Jackson was chemically castrated
by his parents when he was young to 

1661
01:14:20,921 --> 01:14:23,740
preserve his voice.
That's what I suspected.

1662
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:26,740
I suspect that I talked about on the 
podcast like years ago,

1663
01:14:26,741 --> 01:14:29,210
I was saying this,
that I think he was a cast Strada,

1664
01:14:29,710 --> 01:14:30,543
which is they take young boys and they 
used to do this with opera and they 

1665
01:14:33,281 --> 01:14:34,114
would castrate them at a very young age 
and because of that their body never 

1666
01:14:36,581 --> 01:14:37,600
developed testosterone.

1667
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:42,310
So they would do at this high piercing 
like haunting voice.

1668
01:14:42,490 --> 01:14:44,440
It's very strange.
Like we played some of the,

1669
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:49,190
there's only a few recordings of actual 
castrol does that are available or cas,

1670
01:14:49,191 --> 01:14:51,280
stratos,
one of those.

1671
01:14:51,690 --> 01:14:52,660
Um,
but the,

1672
01:14:52,661 --> 01:14:53,494
when you play them they're haunting 
cause you realize like this is a kid 

1673
01:14:55,901 --> 01:14:58,870
that was castrated as a baby so that it 
can be a singer.

1674
01:14:59,230 --> 01:15:03,640
Like this is fucked up.
And that's what Michael Jackson's doctor

1675
01:15:03,641 --> 01:15:06,430
said they did to Michael.
They did it through chemicals.

1676
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:09,840
They chemically castrated him the same 
way as judy pedophile.

1677
01:15:09,850 --> 01:15:14,110
I'm just trying to regulate a situation 
that was already far gone.

1678
01:15:14,140 --> 01:15:15,170
Is that his,
uh,

1679
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:16,270
defense?
No,

1680
01:15:16,271 --> 01:15:18,370
I mean there's no defense.
The doctors just fucking,

1681
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:21,020
you know,
he's just killed me.

1682
01:15:21,021 --> 01:15:24,550
It killed Michael Jackson,
let them get anesthesia until he died.

1683
01:15:24,850 --> 01:15:28,060
His defense wasn't that he was just 
saying there's something else,

1684
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:28,480
right.

1685
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:29,313
Like Michael Jackson was fucked up.
Like his parents literally chemically 

1686
01:15:32,711 --> 01:15:33,544
castrated him to preserve his voice 
because he was the lead singer of the 

1687
01:15:35,411 --> 01:15:36,244
Jackson five when he was a baby.
And that was part of what was great 

1688
01:15:38,561 --> 01:15:42,460
about him was like,
oh baby one not chance.

1689
01:15:42,550 --> 01:15:43,383
Like that voice,
that voice was nothing like anything 

1690
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:49,660
that he would be capable of doing as an 
adult.

1691
01:15:49,661 --> 01:15:52,450
If he grew into a man,
he would have this big old man,

1692
01:15:52,451 --> 01:15:54,980
I want to get some pussy voice.
And he was like,

1693
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,310
no,
where's the little Michael?

1694
01:15:57,550 --> 01:15:58,780
He would have like a,
you know,

1695
01:15:58,781 --> 01:15:59,350
like,
um,

1696
01:15:59,350 --> 01:16:01,780
a barry white voice or something like,
fuck,

1697
01:16:01,781 --> 01:16:03,880
you can't have that.
Like you're Michael,

1698
01:16:04,150 --> 01:16:05,440
you know,
your ABC,

1699
01:16:05,441 --> 01:16:08,210
it's easy as well.
He may not have gotten that deep,

1700
01:16:08,211 --> 01:16:09,520
but this voice,
but the guests,

1701
01:16:09,790 --> 01:16:11,920
if you get that,
that's the belief.

1702
01:16:11,950 --> 01:16:14,800
Be believed that he'd never had the 
chance.

1703
01:16:15,130 --> 01:16:16,090
I believe it.
You know,

1704
01:16:16,091 --> 01:16:16,924
I believe it cause his voice didn't 
sound anything like a regular mans and 

1705
01:16:19,271 --> 01:16:20,650
it didn't sound anything like his 
brothers,

1706
01:16:20,890 --> 01:16:24,220
his brothers all look like regular grown
ass men.

1707
01:16:24,850 --> 01:16:29,850
Michael Jackson's deep voice.
That's not deep.

1708
01:16:34,031 --> 01:16:34,590
So that's fine.

1709
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:35,423
Cold.

1710
01:16:37,170 --> 01:16:39,860
That sounds like John Rivers.
It rangy I was looking it up.

1711
01:16:39,870 --> 01:16:40,703
All those places,
I'm seeing that story about him being 

1712
01:16:42,031 --> 01:16:46,080
castrated or like tabloid eats the sun 
and that kind of stuff.

1713
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:47,340
Right.
But it was,

1714
01:16:47,370 --> 01:16:49,890
wasn't an an interview in like,
uh,

1715
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:53,970
the,
which was a UK paper and I just grew,

1716
01:16:53,980 --> 01:16:55,950
it was the sun,
which is like not the best,

1717
01:16:56,730 --> 01:16:57,600
not the worst.
Right.

1718
01:16:57,601 --> 01:16:58,434
The Daily Mail is the worst.
But both of them actually I did the 

1719
01:16:59,711 --> 01:17:00,570
same.
The equal.

1720
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:03,180
I don't think so.
I'm hoping that's so true.

1721
01:17:03,230 --> 01:17:05,520
And the last time you talked about this,
I got some messages.

1722
01:17:05,521 --> 01:17:06,390
I don't know.
Again,

1723
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:09,030
like what's getting videos like this of 
showing like examples,

1724
01:17:09,170 --> 01:17:10,003
his deep talking voice that's not deep.
There's a lot of chicks that have 

1725
01:17:12,711 --> 01:17:14,180
weighed deeper voices.
Yeah.

1726
01:17:15,770 --> 01:17:18,440
Listen,
that's his deep voice.

1727
01:17:18,710 --> 01:17:20,440
Come on,
let me tell you.

1728
01:17:20,441 --> 01:17:25,070
You mother Fucker,
you listened to the wrong people.

1729
01:17:26,450 --> 01:17:29,750
I mean think of how many women have 
ruthlessly deep voices.

1730
01:17:30,460 --> 01:17:31,041
Yeah.
All right.

1731
01:17:31,041 --> 01:17:32,240
I can tell you a couple of right now.
Yeah.

1732
01:17:32,780 --> 01:17:35,810
I think,
I think they did it to him.

1733
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:39,500
His voice was just phenomenal acumen 
nature.

1734
01:17:39,770 --> 01:17:43,850
Like as an adult,
that is such a fucking phenomenal song.

1735
01:17:43,860 --> 01:17:44,693
It doesn't sound like anything that 
irregular man is capable of saying like 

1736
01:17:48,501 --> 01:17:49,334
the notes that he hits,
like that voice that he had was just 

1737
01:17:51,530 --> 01:17:52,520
haunting.
Right.

1738
01:17:52,550 --> 01:17:55,880
Trying to think of who else is a 
natural,

1739
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:58,630
uh,
star who has a high boy hold.

1740
01:17:58,900 --> 01:17:59,733
He used to sing in Falsetto,
but it was very obvious when he was 

1741
01:18:02,211 --> 01:18:04,040
doing it that he was doing it.
Yes.

1742
01:18:04,070 --> 01:18:06,400
Whereas Michael Jackson like that human 
nature songs,

1743
01:18:06,450 --> 01:18:09,410
one of my favorites because it's such a,
like a slow,

1744
01:18:09,650 --> 01:18:13,400
smooth holding of those sounds.
These are natural sounds that are coming

1745
01:18:13,401 --> 01:18:14,360
from,
you know,

1746
01:18:14,361 --> 01:18:19,361
it's like this natural,
like a warm affectionate tone to it.

1747
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:20,593
It just doesn't seem like a man's voice.
It doesn't seem like a woman's voice 

1748
01:18:25,131 --> 01:18:26,960
either.
That's my point.

1749
01:18:27,330 --> 01:18:30,450
You kept the wrap way talk and that's 
different.

1750
01:18:30,451 --> 01:18:33,560
That's like falsetto.
Are you saying that's like a four?

1751
01:18:33,570 --> 01:18:37,020
Sounds like a caricature.
Yeah,

1752
01:18:37,170 --> 01:18:39,570
you could say that it's in that way.
What does this feel like?

1753
01:18:39,571 --> 01:18:40,580
Dancing.
Whoo.

1754
01:18:40,810 --> 01:18:42,310
Puberty.
Phoneokay yeah.

1755
01:18:42,420 --> 01:18:46,840
Known as Ma mutational false.
I had a call on my penis.

1756
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:50,153
It's a type of voice disorder 
characterized by habitual use of high 

1757
01:18:52,621 --> 01:18:55,430
pitched voice after puberty.
Oh,

1758
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:56,770
so that some people get that.
Yeah.

1759
01:18:56,820 --> 01:18:57,653
It's like a psych psychogenic in nature.
So the other thing is you look at his 

1760
01:18:59,851 --> 01:19:03,070
body,
he had no muscle like his body was like,

1761
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:05,550
I mean he was a very active guy dancing 
all the time,

1762
01:19:05,551 --> 01:19:08,070
but it wasn't billing a dancer.
He was billing a stick.

1763
01:19:08,590 --> 01:19:09,510
You know,
it was a very,

1764
01:19:09,511 --> 01:19:10,344
very thin guy.
That's what you would expect from 

1765
01:19:11,671 --> 01:19:13,230
someone who didn't have any 
testosterone.

1766
01:19:13,260 --> 01:19:15,000
You wouldn't be able to develop any 
muscle.

1767
01:19:16,020 --> 01:19:18,330
I'm sticking with my theory.
I might have biases,

1768
01:19:18,331 --> 01:19:21,210
but they're mine.
They're mine.

1769
01:19:21,350 --> 01:19:22,290
Okay.
I'm sticking with it.

1770
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:25,800
Dig 'em up.
Dig Him up and check the nuts.

1771
01:19:26,340 --> 01:19:29,250
Degas mop.
Summerlin.

1772
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:30,113
Yes.
Is there anything you'd like to talk 

1773
01:19:30,721 --> 01:19:33,480
about?
Anything cause report to in this day and

1774
01:19:33,481 --> 01:19:34,620
age?
Geez,

1775
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:35,603
you just turn it over to me.
I was just trying to figure out where 

1776
01:19:37,681 --> 01:19:38,180
you stand on.

1777
01:19:38,180 --> 01:19:39,410
Thanks.
Um,

1778
01:19:40,060 --> 01:19:41,470
what,
what uh,

1779
01:19:43,530 --> 01:19:45,050
Whoa,
whoa.

1780
01:19:45,170 --> 01:19:48,320
Um,
told you I cried to Michael Jackson.

1781
01:19:48,321 --> 01:19:50,090
Yeah.
Good reason.

1782
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:53,470
Uh,
I

1783
01:19:54,930 --> 01:19:57,000
think I'm a hypocrite.
In what way?

1784
01:19:57,630 --> 01:20:01,680
The gun control,
um,

1785
01:20:01,710 --> 01:20:05,610
March that is happening.
I,

1786
01:20:05,970 --> 01:20:07,020
part of me was like,

1787
01:20:08,370 --> 01:20:11,010
I had a friend,
a mom who said they're the,

1788
01:20:11,180 --> 01:20:13,950
the march is going on right outside our 
house,

1789
01:20:13,951 --> 01:20:14,784
like who wants to join?
And as soon as I clicked on the email 

1790
01:20:18,271 --> 01:20:20,850
and saw what it was in the pit of my 
stomach,

1791
01:20:20,851 --> 01:20:22,080
I was like,
no,

1792
01:20:23,430 --> 01:20:26,640
no.
And then I covered it up with,

1793
01:20:27,180 --> 01:20:29,760
I should do that.
This would be a really good thing to do.

1794
01:20:30,630 --> 01:20:35,630
And I was then fighting with myself 
because I was like,

1795
01:20:37,711 --> 01:20:39,840
well,
you can't have both things at once.

1796
01:20:39,841 --> 01:20:44,841
Either you want to March and do that or 
you don't like,

1797
01:20:45,811 --> 01:20:47,460
those are conflicting things.

1798
01:20:51,510 --> 01:20:52,343
MMM.

1799
01:20:52,460 --> 01:20:55,250
I don't want to do it.
I don't think it'll help.

1800
01:20:55,970 --> 01:21:00,970
But then there's another part of me that
really likes when people march,

1801
01:21:01,551 --> 01:21:05,330
because I do think it changes the 
attitude.

1802
01:21:05,450 --> 01:21:09,350
Like I'm really happy that the women's 
March happened and is happening,

1803
01:21:10,850 --> 01:21:15,850
but I didn't go and I feel like it's 
like a dirty secret and I've started to,

1804
01:21:18,021 --> 01:21:18,854
I have a bit about it.
That's sort of an unformed bit where I 

1805
01:21:21,861 --> 01:21:22,461
say,
yeah,

1806
01:21:22,461 --> 01:21:25,610
I live in Encino because that's where 
you go to give up.

1807
01:21:25,730 --> 01:21:27,320
Like next,
next time you see me,

1808
01:21:27,321 --> 01:21:29,000
I'm going to be like,
I live in thousand oaks,

1809
01:21:29,001 --> 01:21:30,420
I'm allergic to the sun.
And I,

1810
01:21:31,610 --> 01:21:34,760
and I described like the moment I knew I
had given up was,

1811
01:21:34,790 --> 01:21:37,910
and this is just an exploratory,
I still don't have it figured out.

1812
01:21:37,911 --> 01:21:38,744
The mom and I knew I had given up was I 
was making my stairway from my vagina 

1813
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:47,080
poster with glitter and then I marched 
out to the curb and was like,

1814
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:49,230
it's too hot.
Right.

1815
01:21:49,730 --> 01:21:51,680
I don't think there'll be parking at the
march.

1816
01:21:52,580 --> 01:21:55,190
And went back inside.
Did you really?

1817
01:21:56,490 --> 01:22:01,490
Yeah.
I mean that's the joke version,

1818
01:22:02,151 --> 01:22:04,880
but I was very conflicted and like,
oh,

1819
01:22:04,881 --> 01:22:08,030
I should go.
And both times I was doing stuff with my

1820
01:22:08,031 --> 01:22:09,260
kid and it was,
you know,

1821
01:22:09,261 --> 01:22:11,330
a very small,
mundane day.

1822
01:22:11,331 --> 01:22:13,430
And I was like,
I'm not doing it.

1823
01:22:13,431 --> 01:22:14,264
And then I saw the women that did it and
they talked about being in this crowd 

1824
01:22:16,941 --> 01:22:18,590
and how uplifting it was.
And I was like,

1825
01:22:18,650 --> 01:22:22,630
that's amazing.
Like I'm really happy this is happening,

1826
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:29,760
but yet why is it because I don't care 
and I'm weak?

1827
01:22:30,850 --> 01:22:34,150
Or is it because I,
there's a part of me that believes it's,

1828
01:22:34,230 --> 01:22:35,063
I,
I don't want to do it and that it's an 

1829
01:22:36,521 --> 01:22:39,040
actual belief.
And then I was like,

1830
01:22:39,041 --> 01:22:40,810
you're a hypocrite.
And then I was like,

1831
01:22:40,811 --> 01:22:43,990
I'm tired.
You can't think about it anymore.

1832
01:22:44,470 --> 01:22:45,400
But yeah,
the,

1833
01:22:45,401 --> 01:22:49,540
uh,
I don't know.

1834
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:53,830
I think what I'm saying,
I'm a hypocrite is what I'm saying.

1835
01:22:53,831 --> 01:22:54,664
I don't know if you're a hypocrite,
you just have you decided when they 

1836
01:22:56,951 --> 01:22:57,784
knock over,
I just decide what you want to do and 

1837
01:22:59,231 --> 01:23:00,880
what you don't want to do.
You know,

1838
01:23:00,881 --> 01:23:02,380
and you didn't want him to go Marsha 
Day.

1839
01:23:02,381 --> 01:23:05,050
It doesn't mean you're a hypocrite.
It means you just didn't want to do it.

1840
01:23:05,240 --> 01:23:06,070
You're a hypocrite.

1841
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:09,640
If you were saying one thing and voting 
for another,

1842
01:23:09,670 --> 01:23:11,680
that would make you a hypocrite.
That just makes you a person.

1843
01:23:11,681 --> 01:23:15,610
You're just just decided that's not what
you wanted to do and also look,

1844
01:23:15,611 --> 01:23:18,460
it is.
It would be nice if you through your one

1845
01:23:18,461 --> 01:23:19,294
and two,
the 600,000 that were marching through 

1846
01:23:20,441 --> 01:23:24,130
the streets of downtown La,
but there's still 600,000 people.

1847
01:23:24,131 --> 01:23:25,810
Even if she just watching it from the 
news and go,

1848
01:23:25,811 --> 01:23:27,590
you go girl,
it's not,

1849
01:23:27,591 --> 01:23:29,500
you're not helping,
you're not helping,

1850
01:23:29,780 --> 01:23:31,990
but I don't think you're a hypocrite.
It doesn't make you a hypocrite.

1851
01:23:34,150 --> 01:23:36,640
Does it help?
Do you think those big marches,

1852
01:23:36,680 --> 01:23:39,130
and I'm wondering,
I think it empowers people.

1853
01:23:39,610 --> 01:23:41,860
It gets people very excited about the 
cause.

1854
01:23:41,861 --> 01:23:43,660
There's a lot of other people that think
like minded,

1855
01:23:43,820 --> 01:23:45,790
gets people to watch,
gets people to put it on the news.

1856
01:23:45,791 --> 01:23:48,460
People at home watch it.
Maybe people feel like,

1857
01:23:48,461 --> 01:23:49,294
hey,
even though some fucked up things have 

1858
01:23:50,591 --> 01:23:53,020
gone down with Harvey Weinstein and all 
this other shit,

1859
01:23:53,380 --> 01:23:54,213
it least it's turning around.
Maybe people are bummed out that this 

1860
01:23:56,741 --> 01:23:59,620
guy became the president,
but now people are active.

1861
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:03,130
Maybe people are paying attention more,
maybe people are more engaged.

1862
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:07,120
So ultimately it's almost like we were 
talking about before.

1863
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:11,470
You get past that adversity and there's 
actually a benefit to it.

1864
01:24:11,471 --> 01:24:12,304
And sometimes I think even as a country 
we might need that cause we don't have 

1865
01:24:14,711 --> 01:24:17,230
any war over here.
Everything is over there.

1866
01:24:17,260 --> 01:24:20,140
We don't see it in terms of like right 
in front of us on a daily basis.

1867
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:22,810
But this is like a cultural war and an 
idea of war.

1868
01:24:23,110 --> 01:24:23,943
And so I think that these things 
happening right in front of us and 

1869
01:24:26,471 --> 01:24:29,970
having these uncomfortable moments 
forces these conversations is just going

1870
01:24:29,980 --> 01:24:30,813
to be peaks and valleys in the 
conversation where people are rude and 

1871
01:24:32,711 --> 01:24:34,870
people are calm and maybe there's going 
to be some breakthroughs,

1872
01:24:35,050 --> 01:24:38,100
but ultimately it at least four and 
probably,

1873
01:24:38,820 --> 01:24:40,750
well,
I'm pro progress.

1874
01:24:40,990 --> 01:24:41,823
And I think that all of this comes from 
people being disfat dissatisfied with 

1875
01:24:45,371 --> 01:24:48,350
how things are currently.
So the best way to,

1876
01:24:48,530 --> 01:24:50,620
to add,
to very,

1877
01:24:50,621 --> 01:24:51,454
very inspiring to me that you know,
that there's kids came out and our 

1878
01:24:54,551 --> 01:24:58,750
talking and that's like,
I love that about guns.

1879
01:24:59,310 --> 01:25:04,310
It's also sad that sa so,
so little is happening.

1880
01:25:04,810 --> 01:25:06,170
Yeah,
there's,

1881
01:25:06,260 --> 01:25:07,120
there's,
it is sad,

1882
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:08,950
but there's two things that have to be 
addressed.

1883
01:25:09,160 --> 01:25:09,993
Guns have to be addressed for sure,
but also mental health has to be a 

1884
01:25:13,741 --> 01:25:16,180
trust.
We have to address psych medicines.

1885
01:25:16,181 --> 01:25:18,250
We have to address how many of these 
people,

1886
01:25:18,340 --> 01:25:20,920
whether it's correlation equals 
causation or not.

1887
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:24,790
How many of these fucking people have 
been on psych medicine?

1888
01:25:24,970 --> 01:25:27,010
And the answer is almost all of them.
Now,

1889
01:25:27,011 --> 01:25:27,844
does that mean that they're,
they're mentally ill and so that's why 

1890
01:25:29,591 --> 01:25:32,740
they shoot people or that doing the 
psych meds,

1891
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:36,490
a lot of people call these the effects 
of these things very disassociative that

1892
01:25:36,491 --> 01:25:37,324
they allow people to do horrific things 
they might not have been able to do 

1893
01:25:39,281 --> 01:25:42,580
before or inspire them to do that.
There's a real argument there.

1894
01:25:42,790 --> 01:25:43,623
It's not exonerating the people that 
have done these horrific things or 

1895
01:25:45,731 --> 01:25:47,920
exonerating the people that got the guns
in their hands,

1896
01:25:48,040 --> 01:25:49,690
it's not doing that,
but it is a factor.

1897
01:25:49,870 --> 01:25:52,450
There's a fact that the people aren't 
taken into consideration becomes,

1898
01:25:52,451 --> 01:25:56,050
it comes,
it becomes a one or the other thing.

1899
01:25:56,260 --> 01:26:01,150
It becomes an either we need more gun 
control and we need stricter gun control

1900
01:26:01,180 --> 01:26:04,790
or we need to do something about the 
effects of psych medication.

1901
01:26:04,970 --> 01:26:08,630
It's not both and I think it's both.
I really did say,

1902
01:26:08,650 --> 01:26:09,440
well,
yeah,

1903
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:14,440
based on how you just presented it,
it definitely seems like both and it,

1904
01:26:14,750 --> 01:26:15,780
there was an article,
there was,

1905
01:26:15,781 --> 01:26:16,614
or I'm sorry to interrupt you,
but there was an article that was 

1906
01:26:17,391 --> 01:26:18,440
written,
I got to remember this.

1907
01:26:18,650 --> 01:26:21,260
There was written recently that was 
really ridiculous and it would say,

1908
01:26:21,261 --> 01:26:22,094
and contrary to popular belief,
most of these mass shooters are not 

1909
01:26:24,141 --> 01:26:24,974
mentally ill.
Well what the fuck defines mentally ill 

1910
01:26:27,471 --> 01:26:28,304
if they're on psych medication,
they're all on anti psychotics and 

1911
01:26:32,301 --> 01:26:36,730
psychiatric meds and Ssri.
They're almost all so if they not,

1912
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:37,820
they're not mentally ill.

1913
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:42,250
How are you shooting people?
And that in itself,

1914
01:26:42,610 --> 01:26:43,443
that was the next [inaudible] you can 
just go and do a school and shoot 19 

1915
01:26:45,621 --> 01:26:47,150
children.
You have to be mentally ill.

1916
01:26:47,300 --> 01:26:49,880
But the point is if they're not mentally
ill,

1917
01:26:49,881 --> 01:26:52,940
why are they taking medicine for people 
who are mentally ill?

1918
01:26:52,941 --> 01:26:56,390
There's a bullshit article and it's an 
article or who knows what the fucking,

1919
01:26:56,510 --> 01:27:00,650
whether it's a contrarian point of view 
that's is designed to get clickbait hits

1920
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:01,753
or whether it's someone who is trying to
set up a narrative that's contrary to 

1921
01:27:05,361 --> 01:27:08,750
what the pharmaceutical drugs companies 
have known for years.

1922
01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:11,570
There's real effects to those things.
I can,

1923
01:27:11,571 --> 01:27:14,570
and they're not always positive and it's
a God crap crapshoot.

1924
01:27:14,571 --> 01:27:17,210
Whether or not a pill's going to work 
for you or not work for you.

1925
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:19,220
I mean that that's why they have 
abilify.

1926
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:21,320
Abilify is an anti psychotic.

1927
01:27:21,320 --> 01:27:22,153
They prescribed to people who are on,
they're on Ssri but they think about 

1928
01:27:25,281 --> 01:27:26,390
killing themselves.
They're like,

1929
01:27:26,391 --> 01:27:27,770
well if you're thinking about killing 
yourself,

1930
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:30,140
try this first.
Try to stack these two together.

1931
01:27:30,260 --> 01:27:31,093
Maybe that's your mixture.
And Ryan wasn't it the most number one 

1932
01:27:33,830 --> 01:27:37,430
most prescribed drug in the country.
See if that's true.

1933
01:27:37,431 --> 01:27:38,264
Still a bill of an antipsychotic was the
number one most prescribed drug in the 

1934
01:27:42,651 --> 01:27:43,730
country.
Look,

1935
01:27:43,731 --> 01:27:44,564
we've got a fucking problem now how many
of these people are taking medication 

1936
01:27:47,571 --> 01:27:49,550
cause they really need it.
I'm sure if some of them,

1937
01:27:49,730 --> 01:27:50,563
how many people are taking medication 
because drug companies are pushing this 

1938
01:27:52,881 --> 01:27:55,130
shit.
I bill fise top selling us drug.

1939
01:27:55,190 --> 01:27:57,980
There you go.
That's fucking crazy.

1940
01:27:58,070 --> 01:28:00,440
The top selling us drug.
See this.

1941
01:28:00,530 --> 01:28:02,660
Don't blame mental illness.
Blame men.

1942
01:28:03,380 --> 01:28:04,910
Well that's true too.
No,

1943
01:28:04,911 --> 01:28:05,744
she's right there to the guy.
Have a bit that I'm doing about all the 

1944
01:28:08,421 --> 01:28:09,920
different fucked up things that men do.

1945
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:13,260
Like it's an anti men's rights bit and 
it's like that Ma,

1946
01:28:13,490 --> 01:28:14,323
I don't want to do it on the air cause 
they'll fuck it up for before my 

1947
01:28:16,290 --> 01:28:17,123
special.
But it's that we have to pay attention 

1948
01:28:19,011 --> 01:28:21,860
to like all the shit that we do wrong.
Like men,

1949
01:28:21,950 --> 01:28:25,150
like when we look like mass mass 
shootings is not just one.

1950
01:28:25,151 --> 01:28:27,110
If you want to take credit for the good 
things and men have done,

1951
01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:31,100
you have to take credit for all the war.
Like that's also what they'd done.

1952
01:28:31,190 --> 01:28:33,260
Men have cause all of it,
you know.

1953
01:28:33,261 --> 01:28:36,110
And in the bit I go into detail about 
all these different things,

1954
01:28:36,111 --> 01:28:37,670
it's,
it's a build up to something else.

1955
01:28:37,671 --> 01:28:38,504
But this,
this also has to be addressed that it's 

1956
01:28:41,841 --> 01:28:43,490
always men.
That's real too.

1957
01:28:43,810 --> 01:28:46,670
It's not not blaming every man that 
didn't shoot up a school.

1958
01:28:46,910 --> 01:28:48,500
We have to figure out what the fuck is 
it,

1959
01:28:48,710 --> 01:28:49,190
what is it?

1960
01:28:49,190 --> 01:28:50,870
What combination of psych,
drugs,

1961
01:28:51,020 --> 01:28:51,853
guns and being a man is causing this.
And if we just want to blame only the 

1962
01:28:56,601 --> 01:28:59,060
tools,
that seems to be to be fucking crazy.

1963
01:28:59,270 --> 01:29:01,500
They also want to blame the NRA.
Well,

1964
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:02,633
I'd see him one point because you think 
the NRA is helping people get drunk or 

1965
01:29:05,221 --> 01:29:07,500
get guns rather more easily.
I get that.

1966
01:29:07,650 --> 01:29:11,970
But also no one who was a member of the 
NRA has ever committed a mass shooting.

1967
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:14,010
So you have to think of that.
Well,

1968
01:29:14,011 --> 01:29:15,720
well what does that mean?
I mean,

1969
01:29:15,721 --> 01:29:16,554
are you really blaming the group of 
people that want gun safety to be 

1970
01:29:19,351 --> 01:29:20,184
paramount and the group of people that 
doesn't want their rights to be 

1971
01:29:22,681 --> 01:29:23,514
infringed?
Or are you going to attack the group of 

1972
01:29:25,441 --> 01:29:26,940
people that are actually shooting these 
people?

1973
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:29,370
That's the real problem is that people 
that have actually done it,

1974
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:33,560
and I guarantee you there's something 
wrong with every single for that.

1975
01:29:33,670 --> 01:29:34,900
Yeah,
they're right about now.

1976
01:29:35,990 --> 01:29:37,150
Sorry.
No,

1977
01:29:37,160 --> 01:29:39,730
no,
no it because everything you're saying,

1978
01:29:39,731 --> 01:29:44,731
I'm just thinking that the person that 
shoots a bunch of people,

1979
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:49,240
whether they're on psych drugs,
whether they have access to a gun,

1980
01:29:50,470 --> 01:29:55,470
mental health issues there,
they're isolated to the point where they

1981
01:29:56,261 --> 01:29:57,550
can do something like that.
Yeah.

1982
01:29:57,610 --> 01:30:02,610
And that quiet little statement that 
someone is isolated is something that we

1983
01:30:05,171 --> 01:30:08,740
can't address because it's so 
complicated.

1984
01:30:08,741 --> 01:30:12,280
And it's such the fabric of how we live 
our lives.

1985
01:30:12,580 --> 01:30:16,060
It's so much easier to like blame and 
fight for all these things,

1986
01:30:16,061 --> 01:30:21,061
but how do we fix,
you know the one guy who his brother was

1987
01:30:22,001 --> 01:30:23,770
just found with all that porn.
It's like,

1988
01:30:24,100 --> 01:30:24,933
yeah,
the guy that shot all the people in 

1989
01:30:26,351 --> 01:30:27,370
Vegas.
Yeah.

1990
01:30:27,820 --> 01:30:28,653
How do we address just how fucked up 
people are in general or the contraband 

1991
01:30:33,350 --> 01:30:37,150
story about I'm jumping topics,
but the horrible story about that,

1992
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:38,833
can't even talk about it.
The couple that had all those kids that 

1993
01:30:43,151 --> 01:30:48,151
they open their basement,
nobody knew.

1994
01:30:48,970 --> 01:30:50,950
Nobody said anything.
People.

1995
01:30:50,951 --> 01:30:52,300
Yeah,
I thought they seemed weird,

1996
01:30:52,301 --> 01:30:53,134
like how do we address our disconnection
from each other that we that were so 

1997
01:31:01,061 --> 01:31:01,880
fun.

1998
01:31:01,880 --> 01:31:02,713
There is,
you're definitely going to be people 

1999
01:31:04,221 --> 01:31:06,260
that feel alienated and they always want
to,

2000
01:31:06,520 --> 01:31:07,353
they see these people having a good time
around them and they want to just flip 

2001
01:31:09,771 --> 01:31:10,604
over the game.
They want to say fuck you and burn the 

2002
01:31:12,321 --> 01:31:13,154
whole thing to the ground.
There's always going to be people like 

2003
01:31:14,181 --> 01:31:15,014
that.
There's a lot of that that you can see 

2004
01:31:17,211 --> 01:31:19,790
people having a good time around and see
people that are happy that,

2005
01:31:19,791 --> 01:31:20,624
that are enjoying life.
Like especially if this kid felt 

2006
01:31:23,151 --> 01:31:23,984
alienated in school and bullied and cast
out and targeted and then he gets free 

2007
01:31:29,181 --> 01:31:30,830
and he sees these people that are having
fun.

2008
01:31:30,831 --> 01:31:33,050
He just wants to go back and just punish
everyone.

2009
01:31:33,290 --> 01:31:35,480
This is a very common theme,
you know,

2010
01:31:35,481 --> 01:31:38,630
people,
how do we pain that theme?

2011
01:31:38,631 --> 01:31:39,464
How do we help people who are in pain?
We are going to have to do a lot of 

2012
01:31:42,351 --> 01:31:42,890
things right?

2013
01:31:42,890 --> 01:31:44,840
Because like,
think of the people that uh,

2014
01:31:44,930 --> 01:31:45,763
had their children locked up.
Who are these monsters and how'd they 

2015
01:31:48,471 --> 01:31:51,140
have a kid?
How was it so hard to get a car license?

2016
01:31:51,141 --> 01:31:51,974
It's,
and it's easy as fuck to have a kid and 

2017
01:31:53,271 --> 01:31:56,510
raise another member of our culture,
of our society,

2018
01:31:56,520 --> 01:31:58,160
our community.
How's that possible?

2019
01:31:58,161 --> 01:31:58,994
You've,
you've introduced a poison and toxic 

2020
01:32:00,551 --> 01:32:03,160
member to our community cause you did a 
terrible job of raising them.

2021
01:32:03,220 --> 01:32:07,150
And one of the oldest ones,
I went to college and then they would,

2022
01:32:07,390 --> 01:32:10,210
I can't remember.
I think it was a dude would come out and

2023
01:32:10,211 --> 01:32:11,950
the mom would be waiting for him and 
like,

2024
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:18,360
so the oldest one was out in the world 
and still no one could help.

2025
01:32:19,211 --> 01:32:22,340
Like whatever,
mind mallards they had,

2026
01:32:22,341 --> 01:32:23,174
this one was out and he didn't say that 
his younger brothers and sisters were 

2027
01:32:26,081 --> 01:32:28,030
locked up.
I had gas.

2028
01:32:28,050 --> 01:32:30,490
Oh God,
he should be in jail.

2029
01:32:30,940 --> 01:32:32,680
Yeah.
I don't know the whole,

2030
01:32:32,980 --> 01:32:34,510
the details of that.
I mean it's,

2031
01:32:35,240 --> 01:32:37,210
I guess it's not his fault.
He's probably what?

2032
01:32:37,300 --> 01:32:38,133
Beyond fucked in the head,
but just the fact that he could keep 

2033
01:32:40,271 --> 01:32:41,650
that a secret.
It's like what?

2034
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:46,250
It's horrific and you and you just think
about,

2035
01:32:46,820 --> 01:32:47,653
I mean,
how many people are fucked by the time 

2036
01:32:50,391 --> 01:32:51,224
they have children?
Like it's not even that they're doing a 

2037
01:32:53,331 --> 01:32:56,300
bad job of it.
They're incapable of doing a good job of

2038
01:32:56,301 --> 01:33:00,020
it there too fucked up there,
too fucked up from their own upbringing.

2039
01:33:00,050 --> 01:33:02,220
But they still get horny.
I mean,

2040
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:04,910
does this as is what happens in this 
world?

2041
01:33:05,420 --> 01:33:07,730
People like to have sex.
They have saks boone,

2042
01:33:07,731 --> 01:33:10,520
there's a person got a raise it,
but I'm fucked up and I love math.

2043
01:33:10,700 --> 01:33:13,460
What do you do in men?
Mra?

2044
01:33:13,630 --> 01:33:15,110
Yeah,
it's fucking men.

2045
01:33:15,890 --> 01:33:18,980
It's everybody.
It's definitely men though and that's,

2046
01:33:19,010 --> 01:33:19,843
that's my issue with all this.
A masculine bullshit is a lot of these 

2047
01:33:24,051 --> 01:33:29,051
guys that are proclaiming masculinity or
really bitches and that the,

2048
01:33:30,470 --> 01:33:33,920
that real men wouldn't be doing this 
stuff in the first place.

2049
01:33:34,390 --> 01:33:37,340
You would look past most of this stuff 
in the first place.

2050
01:33:39,690 --> 01:33:40,523
You know,

2051
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:45,040
there's a lot of people in this world 
that don't have personal sovereignty,

2052
01:33:45,190 --> 01:33:47,410
whether it's men or women and they're 
not,

2053
01:33:47,470 --> 01:33:48,303
they're not raised correctly and then 
they didn't go on a beneficial path 

2054
01:33:51,611 --> 01:33:54,070
through life that left them in the 
current state,

2055
01:33:54,370 --> 01:33:58,420
whether they're a helpful member of our 
community.

2056
01:33:58,710 --> 01:34:01,810
That's the show about family values.
That's what you're really about.

2057
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:04,160
It is about community values,
life,

2058
01:34:04,170 --> 01:34:05,003
friendship.
You know like what we were talking 

2059
01:34:05,891 --> 01:34:06,724
about,
the comedy store,

2060
01:34:07,060 --> 01:34:07,893
friendships giant.
It's very important and some people 

2061
01:34:10,121 --> 01:34:13,360
don't have any fucking friends and 
that's a dark place to be bullied.

2062
01:34:13,361 --> 01:34:14,920
You're whole life.
Don't have any friends.

2063
01:34:14,921 --> 01:34:15,754
You're on medication,
you're all fucked up and you're one of 

2064
01:34:17,861 --> 01:34:20,170
those guys out there that just wants to 
go out with a bang,

2065
01:34:20,620 --> 01:34:21,453
you know,
just want to walk into a mall with a 

2066
01:34:22,181 --> 01:34:23,770
fucking shotgun and go out with a bang.

2067
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:25,420
There's a lot of people that think like 
that.

2068
01:34:25,421 --> 01:34:26,860
They just don't have the courage to do 
it.

2069
01:34:27,160 --> 01:34:27,993
I mean,
even going back to that one night that 

2070
01:34:28,781 --> 01:34:30,880
we,
when I said I don't know if I can do it,

2071
01:34:30,910 --> 01:34:33,130
I mean it's a smaller example,
but,

2072
01:34:33,670 --> 01:34:36,940
but still valid,
you know,

2073
01:34:36,941 --> 01:34:39,910
and you just looked at me and said,
you can your guide,

2074
01:34:39,911 --> 01:34:40,744
like you're doing it or you know,
whatever you're responsible as those 

2075
01:34:43,451 --> 01:34:46,240
little moments of like,
those are big,

2076
01:34:46,460 --> 01:34:48,100
a real connection.
Yeah.

2077
01:34:48,280 --> 01:34:49,113
When you know someone really does care 
about you and someone who really does 

2078
01:34:51,221 --> 01:34:52,930
like you and we're not,
you know,

2079
01:34:53,320 --> 01:34:58,320
talking every day.
It was just a moment of and commonality

2080
01:34:58,550 --> 01:35:01,610
and seeing that other person,
we fixed it,

2081
01:35:01,611 --> 01:35:03,830
everybody and we fixed it.
We did it well.

2082
01:35:03,831 --> 01:35:04,664
I never had

2083
01:35:05,120 --> 01:35:07,670
never knew that you didn't think well of
me or,

2084
01:35:07,790 --> 01:35:09,720
or I did.

2085
01:35:09,950 --> 01:35:10,783
Yeah.
I never felt like he didn't like him 

2086
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:15,320
sedated by you and I didn't I,
well I didn't know you,

2087
01:35:15,321 --> 01:35:17,300
but I just like your vibe to me was 
like,

2088
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:20,660
oh,
like he doesn't like me very much.

2089
01:35:22,340 --> 01:35:24,830
But that wasn't because of anything 
years ago though,

2090
01:35:24,831 --> 01:35:28,970
this is probably would have been 2000 
whatever.

2091
01:35:28,971 --> 01:35:29,804
Right,
right.

2092
01:35:29,810 --> 01:35:33,080
But it was never anything where like I 
didn't like you.

2093
01:35:33,140 --> 01:35:38,140
I'm sure I probably was not even really 
on your radar or not even a thing.

2094
01:35:38,691 --> 01:35:39,524
I'm not liking or liking that.
I know we never really had any 

2095
01:35:42,771 --> 01:35:43,940
interactions.
No,

2096
01:35:43,941 --> 01:35:46,580
I just felt your power took it first.
Personally.

2097
01:35:47,350 --> 01:35:48,320
I felt your power.

2098
01:35:49,880 --> 01:35:53,030
That's pretty silly.
Well we got through that too.

2099
01:35:53,480 --> 01:35:54,313
Yeah,
we did.

2100
01:35:56,450 --> 01:35:58,250
So if you do a special,
yeah.

2101
01:35:58,280 --> 01:35:59,720
When you think you'd be gearing up for 
that,

2102
01:36:00,620 --> 01:36:02,840
have you thought through it?
Like to be ready in a year?

2103
01:36:02,980 --> 01:36:05,480
We were ready in a month.
Oh my gosh.

2104
01:36:05,750 --> 01:36:06,583
Too much.

2105
01:36:06,660 --> 01:36:07,710
No,
it was the bed.

2106
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:11,270
Or has that been mad?
Um,

2107
01:36:11,280 --> 01:36:12,113
nap,
nap.

2108
01:36:13,080 --> 01:36:13,913
I have to figure out,
cause so many comics I know do it 

2109
01:36:17,281 --> 01:36:18,690
themselves.
Yeah.

2110
01:36:20,350 --> 01:36:25,350
I think I could have the material I want
fairly like within the next six months,

2111
01:36:26,891 --> 01:36:31,210
but then I need to figure out the how,
the,

2112
01:36:31,211 --> 01:36:31,870
how

2113
01:36:31,870 --> 01:36:32,650
the,
how.

2114
01:36:32,650 --> 01:36:35,350
There's a few companies that do you need
to make,

2115
01:36:35,440 --> 01:36:37,540
I need to make it first.
Right?

2116
01:36:37,570 --> 01:36:38,980
That's how you do it.
Yeah.

2117
01:36:39,010 --> 01:36:41,050
Just make it,
yeah,

2118
01:36:41,110 --> 01:36:41,943
that's not a bad move.
The just making it first is not a bad 

2119
01:36:44,351 --> 01:36:45,880
mood because when you just make it 
first,

2120
01:36:46,180 --> 01:36:48,730
then you could just sort of sell it 
somewhere.

2121
01:36:48,790 --> 01:36:49,623
And if it's good,
everybody is always looking for new 

2122
01:36:51,131 --> 01:36:52,510
comedy.
You know,

2123
01:36:52,570 --> 01:36:53,403
there's,
we were just talking earlier about the 

2124
01:36:54,231 --> 01:36:55,160
Amazon.
I heard a

2125
01:36:55,160 --> 01:36:55,993
little bit of scare because I had teed 
up for it when I first went on the road 

2126
01:36:58,701 --> 01:37:00,560
and had had an hour.
And then,

2127
01:37:00,650 --> 01:37:02,780
um,
my manager at the time,

2128
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:05,570
I think tried to sell it on a high 
level.

2129
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:08,630
This was before Netflix is what it is 
now.

2130
01:37:08,631 --> 01:37:13,010
It was a few years back when they were 
first started doing hours,

2131
01:37:13,011 --> 01:37:14,870
I think.
Um,

2132
01:37:15,950 --> 01:37:16,910
and they were like,
no.

2133
01:37:16,940 --> 01:37:17,773
And then she,
you know,

2134
01:37:17,870 --> 01:37:19,700
all,
all the top tier people were like,

2135
01:37:19,790 --> 01:37:20,571
no.
Like,

2136
01:37:20,571 --> 01:37:22,550
no one knows her as a comic,
like we're not buying it.

2137
01:37:22,551 --> 01:37:25,310
And then she was like,
let me sell it at the second tier.

2138
01:37:25,311 --> 01:37:26,210
And they're like,
no.

2139
01:37:26,720 --> 01:37:29,480
And then this whole time I was like,
you should have just done it myself.

2140
01:37:29,510 --> 01:37:34,510
But I think I've been lucky enough to 
have get a lot of acting jobs.

2141
01:37:36,080 --> 01:37:39,860
So whenever I'm like being myself 
starter and then a carrot comes along,

2142
01:37:39,861 --> 01:37:40,260
I'm like,
Oh,

2143
01:37:40,260 --> 01:37:41,630
do that acting job.
That'll work.

2144
01:37:41,631 --> 01:37:42,464
So,
so I've never had to sort of grind it 

2145
01:37:45,111 --> 01:37:47,360
out in that way.
And that's why it scares me.

2146
01:37:47,361 --> 01:37:48,194
So then at the,
when it didn't sell at that time I just 

2147
01:37:50,091 --> 01:37:50,990
went,
oh,

2148
01:37:50,991 --> 01:37:53,780
I should have done that myself and now 
I'm tired of this material.

2149
01:37:53,781 --> 01:37:54,770
And then,
you know,

2150
01:37:54,771 --> 01:37:55,710
time passes.
I'm like,

2151
01:37:55,711 --> 01:37:56,010
maybe it's

2152
01:37:56,010 --> 01:38:00,060
for the best because you know,
once I do that,

2153
01:38:00,090 --> 01:38:00,923
then I'm really out there as that.
It might be a commitment issue on my 

2154
01:38:04,171 --> 01:38:06,000
part.
I know that film.

2155
01:38:06,060 --> 01:38:07,230
I know what you mean.
It's just hard.

2156
01:38:07,231 --> 01:38:09,850
It's hard to just fucking dig your heels
in,

2157
01:38:09,870 --> 01:38:11,850
decide to do something that's tough like
that.

2158
01:38:11,851 --> 01:38:15,180
And then also the financial investment 
if you decide to do it yourself.

2159
01:38:15,290 --> 01:38:16,890
Yeah.
Like you got to spend a lot of money and

2160
01:38:16,891 --> 01:38:17,724
hire crude.
Make sure the director doesn't fuck it 

2161
01:38:18,901 --> 01:38:19,734
up and make sure it all comes out well.
You know who do I know the did one and 

2162
01:38:25,201 --> 01:38:28,590
they fucked up the shooting of it and he
had a wind up putting it online.

2163
01:38:28,591 --> 01:38:29,424
Was it rory Albany's did.
He said that he did one that someone 

2164
01:38:32,281 --> 01:38:36,690
fucked up and he wound up putting it 
online or he hasn't released his,

2165
01:38:36,700 --> 01:38:37,533
yeah,
he was thinking about doing it soon 

2166
01:38:38,340 --> 01:38:43,010
sound my throws him somebody else then 
Kurt Metzger.

2167
01:38:43,930 --> 01:38:44,320
Hm.

2168
01:38:44,320 --> 01:38:45,153
Whatever.
Yeah,

2169
01:38:45,400 --> 01:38:48,160
someone funny.
Did you do yours yourself?

2170
01:38:48,280 --> 01:38:50,740
I did one of them myself.
Yeah,

2171
01:38:51,030 --> 01:38:53,170
I've done two of them.
Two of them myself.

2172
01:38:53,290 --> 01:38:54,910
Yeah.
Um,

2173
01:38:54,940 --> 01:38:59,050
but the best was last year doing it with
Netflix.

2174
01:38:59,350 --> 01:39:01,390
That was the best because they're just 
so easy.

2175
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:02,680
They just like,
go ahead.

2176
01:39:02,770 --> 01:39:04,570
They used to let you do it.
They're like,

2177
01:39:04,571 --> 01:39:05,800
we like it.
Yay.

2178
01:39:05,980 --> 01:39:08,410
That's awesome.
There was zero feedback,

2179
01:39:08,710 --> 01:39:09,543
you know,
they just wanted to make sure it was an 

2180
01:39:10,870 --> 01:39:11,830
hour long.
Not too long.

2181
01:39:11,831 --> 01:39:14,860
Not too short.
I kind of want to do a 15 minute special

2182
01:39:14,940 --> 01:39:15,773
cause I have this thing that I've done 
for years and I don't do it every very 

2183
01:39:18,461 --> 01:39:20,620
often,
but it's a in a throw down.

2184
01:39:20,650 --> 01:39:22,690
It's like,
hey guys,

2185
01:39:22,950 --> 01:39:24,640
take a hey guys,
take a break.

2186
01:39:25,420 --> 01:39:27,100
Hey ladies,
fucking guys.

2187
01:39:27,101 --> 01:39:28,420
Am I right ladies?
Take a break.

2188
01:39:28,421 --> 01:39:29,254
What's up with these bitches?
But like 15 minutes like bitches and 

2189
01:39:33,371 --> 01:39:34,390
they're scented candles.

2190
01:39:34,390 --> 01:39:35,890
They're always like,
smell this,

2191
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:38,410
try these sheets.
Uh Guys,

2192
01:39:38,411 --> 01:39:39,520
take a break.
Ladies,

2193
01:39:41,110 --> 01:39:46,110
give us a ring if you want to be that.
That's funny.

2194
01:39:46,570 --> 01:39:48,520
I like it.
15 minutes.

2195
01:39:48,521 --> 01:39:49,630
So that's just something they're doing 
now,

2196
01:39:50,110 --> 01:39:51,310
right?
That's what I heard.

2197
01:39:51,370 --> 01:39:52,203
Yeah.
No,

2198
01:39:52,360 --> 01:39:53,193
I'd love to do an hour for sure.
But that's more of a commitment to 

2199
01:39:56,860 --> 01:40:00,170
things and ideas that you wanted to have
some girth to.

2200
01:40:01,210 --> 01:40:02,080
Well,
you could definitely do it,

2201
01:40:02,081 --> 01:40:04,990
but we were also talking about how 
Amazon's doing specials now too.

2202
01:40:05,440 --> 01:40:06,273
They did Bob Saget special and they ere,
they bought a bunch of other people 

2203
01:40:08,931 --> 01:40:11,080
specials that they bought.
Brian counts special,

2204
01:40:11,380 --> 01:40:12,213
they bought all those specialists.
And so all those specials are now on 

2205
01:40:14,381 --> 01:40:15,214
Amazon.
A lot of places for you that's pretty 

2206
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:21,100
swollen.
Just do it is what you're saying.

2207
01:40:21,101 --> 01:40:22,150
Sure.
Yeah.

2208
01:40:22,151 --> 01:40:25,270
The only terrifying thing is once you do
it then you have to write new material.

2209
01:40:25,360 --> 01:40:27,790
That's where it gets scary because then 
you're doing,

2210
01:40:27,791 --> 01:40:28,624
you're left without weapons.
He started from scratch and you've got 

2211
01:40:31,601 --> 01:40:32,434
to grind and dig,
claw your way back up to the top of the 

2212
01:40:36,161 --> 01:40:36,850
hill.

2213
01:40:36,850 --> 01:40:39,080
Oh okay.

2214
01:40:40,210 --> 01:40:41,200
He never done that before.
Huh?

2215
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:42,353
Especial.
Most special when you have to abandon 

2216
01:40:43,841 --> 01:40:45,160
all the materials and start from 
scratch.

2217
01:40:45,161 --> 01:40:46,870
Now as you were saying that,
I was thinking,

2218
01:40:46,871 --> 01:40:47,704
cause I've done one woman shows I've 
done but I'm still pulling from like 

2219
01:40:51,941 --> 01:40:53,770
that show cause it's,
you know,

2220
01:40:53,771 --> 01:40:53,980
if it's

2221
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:57,790
stuff that I still like I'll pull it up.
I have stuff about,

2222
01:40:57,791 --> 01:40:58,624
you know,
my son being an infant and he's nine 

2223
01:40:59,951 --> 01:41:00,784
years old.
I still talking about my csection if 

2224
01:41:04,691 --> 01:41:05,524
it's late at the comedy store,
I'm like let's get into it cause I know 

2225
01:41:08,441 --> 01:41:10,040
they don't want to hear it.
I'm like let me,

2226
01:41:10,090 --> 01:41:10,923
let's talk about it.
It's 1:00 AM with second with a c 

2227
01:41:13,361 --> 01:41:16,450
section.
Those are strength training.

2228
01:41:16,480 --> 01:41:19,990
That's like running with weights on like
a weight vest,

2229
01:41:20,020 --> 01:41:22,870
weights on your back and like a ankle 
weights too.

2230
01:41:23,050 --> 01:41:23,883
I've learned to really love him.
It took me so long to just even leave 

2231
01:41:26,561 --> 01:41:27,850
the house.
I would,

2232
01:41:27,910 --> 01:41:29,980
I would be standing there at the comedy 
store.

2233
01:41:29,981 --> 01:41:34,981
Like I had to train myself to be like,
no,

2234
01:41:35,620 --> 01:41:37,720
this is part of it.
You have to be awake,

2235
01:41:37,750 --> 01:41:39,740
you have to want to be here.
Yeah.

2236
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:40,833
It was a weird psychological,
cause I'm part of me is like just want 

2237
01:41:44,231 --> 01:41:47,950
to do my set,
but then I'm like resenting that I'm out

2238
01:41:47,951 --> 01:41:48,730
of the house.

2239
01:41:48,730 --> 01:41:51,130
Like I come some sort of princess or 
something.

2240
01:41:51,131 --> 01:41:53,380
How dare.
It's like,

2241
01:41:53,670 --> 01:41:55,000
no,
you made this choice.

2242
01:41:55,030 --> 01:41:58,300
You want it.
But connecting the want with what it is.

2243
01:41:58,540 --> 01:41:59,373
I don't know.
I mean I've talked to other people who 

2244
01:42:00,041 --> 01:42:01,210
are like,
oh,

2245
01:42:01,640 --> 01:42:03,580
like,
well don't do midnight shows,

2246
01:42:03,581 --> 01:42:04,130
you know.
But,

2247
01:42:04,130 --> 01:42:04,963
but clearly I wanted it and I wanted it 
at the comedy store and once I got used 

2248
01:42:09,371 --> 01:42:10,204
to it,
I was like,

2249
01:42:10,210 --> 01:42:11,440
this is the best.
Like,

2250
01:42:12,520 --> 01:42:13,353
I love doing those late spots.
Not that I wouldn't mind an 8:00 PM 

2251
01:42:16,961 --> 01:42:18,290
shot,
shot,

2252
01:42:19,490 --> 01:42:21,290
shot,
shot,

2253
01:42:21,291 --> 01:42:22,124
and my slot.

2254
01:42:26,220 --> 01:42:30,340
Nitrile it makes you talk and I'm only,
I didn't even get halfway through.

2255
01:42:30,341 --> 01:42:31,174
I'm taking it easy.
Well then you were about 135 milligrams 

2256
01:42:33,401 --> 01:42:36,670
caffeine and it's good.
It's not bad.

2257
01:42:36,671 --> 01:42:37,510
Right.
And it's really good.

2258
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:39,610
Espresso.
Do you drink that kind of stuff?

2259
01:42:39,640 --> 01:42:40,720
Yes.
Black coffee.

2260
01:42:41,090 --> 01:42:41,771
Yeah.
I'll go.

2261
01:42:41,771 --> 01:42:42,850
I go both ways.
Wrong.

2262
01:42:42,940 --> 01:42:45,440
I like a latte.
I like a latte.

2263
01:42:46,390 --> 01:42:47,840
Vanilla sweetener and shit.
No,

2264
01:42:47,870 --> 01:42:49,030
not sure.
No,

2265
01:42:49,240 --> 01:42:49,811
no,
no.

2266
01:42:49,811 --> 01:42:52,480
Like a straight up nonfat.
I'll do it all.

2267
01:42:52,630 --> 01:42:55,090
I'll drink a vanilla latte.
I won't turn my nose at it.

2268
01:42:55,330 --> 01:42:57,040
I'll do a shot of a sham.
So yeah,

2269
01:42:57,100 --> 01:42:58,650
it's all yummy.
Yeah.

2270
01:42:59,400 --> 01:43:00,233
You're um,
you're kind of on a path of self 

2271
01:43:02,351 --> 01:43:04,270
improvement through comedy.
Do you realize that?

2272
01:43:05,050 --> 01:43:07,060
I like that because it seems like it,
right?

2273
01:43:07,120 --> 01:43:07,953
Yeah.
Like if you seem like a more empowered 

2274
01:43:10,691 --> 01:43:13,120
by this I,
I definitely am.

2275
01:43:14,140 --> 01:43:15,400
Yeah,
that's true,

2276
01:43:15,401 --> 01:43:17,530
isn't it?
It is.

2277
01:43:17,950 --> 01:43:19,870
It is.
It's,

2278
01:43:21,190 --> 01:43:25,630
it's helping me.
He said so reluctantly.

2279
01:43:26,110 --> 01:43:28,090
So decision,
a strange thing.

2280
01:43:28,420 --> 01:43:29,600
Well,
it's what it is,

2281
01:43:29,601 --> 01:43:32,500
is you're fighting your alt roots.
So it is,

2282
01:43:32,501 --> 01:43:35,530
you're fighting the smugness and the 
sarcasm.

2283
01:43:35,650 --> 01:43:38,230
You're fighting it.
Fighting sincerity.

2284
01:43:38,260 --> 01:43:43,260
Like Saturday self improvement coach,
is that what I'm doing?

2285
01:43:47,530 --> 01:43:48,820
Sure.
I'm like,

2286
01:43:48,860 --> 01:43:49,693
ah,
if I could just get on a pilot that I 

2287
01:43:51,290 --> 01:43:52,123
back to

2288
01:43:52,780 --> 01:43:54,530
work anymore.
No commitment.

2289
01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:56,300
This is a zone out.
You're not even there.

2290
01:43:56,600 --> 01:43:57,291
You know?
And he like,

2291
01:43:57,291 --> 01:43:58,450
you do your best,
but Simon,

2292
01:43:58,451 --> 01:43:59,630
you're writing whatever.

2293
01:44:01,080 --> 01:44:04,910
So what's easier,
so much easier for no good sitcoms.

2294
01:44:05,020 --> 01:44:05,853
Dropping some logic.
When I was on news radio when it was 

2295
01:44:07,981 --> 01:44:09,600
trading on a pilot,
so about yeah,

2296
01:44:09,601 --> 01:44:10,920
go on.
When it was smooth,

2297
01:44:10,921 --> 01:44:13,800
so easy to show up script.
Good.

2298
01:44:13,830 --> 01:44:16,020
Got a couple good lines.
Remember him,

2299
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:17,153
deliver him,
sit in the makeup chair puts what's 

2300
01:44:19,471 --> 01:44:20,940
wrong with that?
Boom.

2301
01:44:21,170 --> 01:44:24,450
Nothing wrong with someone's bringing 
you a drink.

2302
01:44:24,660 --> 01:44:28,140
It doesn't feel as good.
It's not as good problems.

2303
01:44:28,141 --> 01:44:28,974
You already killed Mary Lynn.
You've already crossed over into the 

2304
01:44:31,201 --> 01:44:32,460
dark lands.
Ah,

2305
01:44:32,470 --> 01:44:34,950
okay.
When you kill like Saturday night on the

2306
01:44:34,951 --> 01:44:37,230
road and you're fucking crushing,
right?

2307
01:44:37,990 --> 01:44:38,823
When you put it all together and you 
remember those dark days and you first 

2308
01:44:41,161 --> 01:44:44,040
started doing it again,
now you're killing.

2309
01:44:44,370 --> 01:44:45,630
Yeah.
How good's that feel?

2310
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:48,150
It feels great.
It's amazing.

2311
01:44:48,151 --> 01:44:50,670
But then I will it all chip away.
Like,

2312
01:44:50,671 --> 01:44:53,400
how long will I let that feel great?
You know,

2313
01:44:53,800 --> 01:44:55,600
maybe double the next morning and then,
uh,

2314
01:44:55,690 --> 01:44:57,940
then it starts all over again and then 
you got to do it again.

2315
01:44:57,980 --> 01:44:58,460
Yeah.
Yeah.

2316
01:44:58,460 --> 01:44:59,940
I have to.
That's how,

2317
01:44:59,990 --> 01:45:03,160
that's the thing.
There's never a point where like,

2318
01:45:03,180 --> 01:45:03,910
oh,
I made it.

2319
01:45:03,910 --> 01:45:05,330
Let me sit down.
There's no,

2320
01:45:05,470 --> 01:45:07,030
that doesn't,
that place doesn't exist.

2321
01:45:09,370 --> 01:45:09,660
Okay.

2322
01:45:09,660 --> 01:45:14,340
Well,
he always have the bed,

2323
01:45:14,910 --> 01:45:16,760
Delaware,
you can always take those down.

2324
01:45:16,770 --> 01:45:18,780
Is there,
you can always enjoy those naps.

2325
01:45:18,840 --> 01:45:21,180
Ah,
a pillow is always there.

2326
01:45:21,570 --> 01:45:24,660
He got now with all your shots,
the cat can crawl in bed with you.

2327
01:45:25,440 --> 01:45:26,273
No problem.

2328
01:45:27,070 --> 01:45:27,440
Okay.

2329
01:45:27,440 --> 01:45:28,273
I mean,
I still have a lot of fear with even 

2330
01:45:29,571 --> 01:45:31,010
last night we,
how was your,

2331
01:45:31,011 --> 01:45:33,230
uh,
your standup on the spot?

2332
01:45:33,380 --> 01:45:35,480
It was great.
I loved it so much.

2333
01:45:35,481 --> 01:45:37,910
I spent the entire day going,
why did I do this?

2334
01:45:38,600 --> 01:45:41,240
I'm not clever enough.
Like I can't think of jokes.

2335
01:45:41,540 --> 01:45:43,340
I'm like,
just say the opposite.

2336
01:45:43,341 --> 01:45:45,560
Just get angry.
Go on around like I'm coming up with all

2337
01:45:45,561 --> 01:45:47,330
devices because I'm like,
you won't,

2338
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:49,810
you won't write a joke on the spot.
You don't know how to write.

2339
01:45:49,830 --> 01:45:51,900
Your brain doesn't work like that.
Oh,

2340
01:45:51,950 --> 01:45:56,490
like a crazy person.
A nightmare.

2341
01:45:56,491 --> 01:45:58,910
A living nightmare.
I spent the day going,

2342
01:45:58,970 --> 01:46:00,170
Oh really?
Oh,

2343
01:46:00,171 --> 01:46:01,970
you're going to just come up with Joe 
because on the spot,

2344
01:46:01,971 --> 01:46:04,310
like good luck with that.
The voice in my head,

2345
01:46:04,880 --> 01:46:08,060
once I got there,
it was delightful.

2346
01:46:08,330 --> 01:46:08,781
It was like,
oh,

2347
01:46:08,781 --> 01:46:11,660
this is my real life.
This isn't the life in my head.

2348
01:46:11,770 --> 01:46:14,390
Yeah.
It was a delight.

2349
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:15,633
Yeah.
I had to call my friend afterwards and 

2350
01:46:16,611 --> 01:46:19,490
go,
I think I just experienced pleasure.

2351
01:46:21,530 --> 01:46:23,360
I hate to say this,
but that was

2352
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:25,420
shareable.
Well,

2353
01:46:25,421 --> 01:46:29,310
that room in particular that that set 
for people don't stand up on the spot.

2354
01:46:29,311 --> 01:46:30,144
As Jeremiah Watkins show,
he used to have a show called 

2355
01:46:31,801 --> 01:46:33,860
Thunderpussy I guess.
Oh really?

2356
01:46:34,080 --> 01:46:34,920
Yeah.
That was the same show,

2357
01:46:35,100 --> 01:46:36,840
but they called it thunderpussy for some
reason.

2358
01:46:37,050 --> 01:46:37,770
Uh,
now,

2359
01:46:37,770 --> 01:46:41,080
um,
what you do is you go on stage and uh,

2360
01:46:41,190 --> 01:46:44,790
people just have suggestions like I met,
I make people put their hands up,

2361
01:46:44,791 --> 01:46:49,260
I point to someone and then they give 
you a suggestion and right away you just

2362
01:46:49,261 --> 01:46:54,261
start talking about it.
And I have some real potential leads for

2363
01:46:54,481 --> 01:46:57,750
bits from last night,
like two solid ones where I,

2364
01:46:58,110 --> 01:47:01,230
what I do is I don't want to,
but I do when I get home,

2365
01:47:01,231 --> 01:47:03,030
I'm fucking tired.
I've had a long day,

2366
01:47:03,240 --> 01:47:05,790
but it's still sit in front of the 
computer and I play the recordings and I

2367
01:47:05,791 --> 01:47:08,880
go back.
I have to have to,

2368
01:47:08,881 --> 01:47:09,690
it's part of the job.

2369
01:47:09,690 --> 01:47:12,820
Have to clean your room.
It's like those things like got to brush

2370
01:47:12,821 --> 01:47:13,654
your teeth.
I don't want him to go to sleep 

2371
01:47:14,340 --> 01:47:15,930
pressure.
Fucking teeth got to do it.

2372
01:47:16,230 --> 01:47:17,063
And so I'm sure this is fairly normal.
How many sets I have in my phone that 

2373
01:47:20,881 --> 01:47:22,920
I've never listened to.
Yeah,

2374
01:47:22,921 --> 01:47:24,350
it's really normal.
Um,

2375
01:47:24,940 --> 01:47:27,510
I listened to the mall.
You have to,

2376
01:47:28,170 --> 01:47:29,003
that's the only time.
I don't listen to the malls when I'm on 

2377
01:47:29,851 --> 01:47:31,030
the road,
I'm doing four sets.

2378
01:47:31,170 --> 01:47:32,860
Erase it after.
No,

2379
01:47:33,170 --> 01:47:34,530
you save it.
I'll show you.

2380
01:47:35,210 --> 01:47:36,043
I got all these bitches in here and 
you've listened to all of them and they 

2381
01:47:40,231 --> 01:47:41,400
stay there.
Look at them all.

2382
01:47:41,490 --> 01:47:44,310
How do you know which one to go back to 
for stuff?

2383
01:47:44,390 --> 01:47:47,320
I don't really mark them.
I edit the name.

2384
01:47:47,321 --> 01:47:48,780
See at the bottom.
That's good.

2385
01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:49,713
Yeah.
But then you won't know how do you 

2386
01:47:51,571 --> 01:47:53,970
remember which bit in this one?

2387
01:47:53,970 --> 01:47:56,820
You just kind of just record it and I go
over it with a notebook.

2388
01:47:56,850 --> 01:48:00,510
But the thing with me as the big thing 
is,

2389
01:48:00,750 --> 01:48:03,510
um,
I know when something happened,

2390
01:48:03,570 --> 01:48:04,403
like if I do a sat and I'm like okay,
I went on a totally different chain of 

2391
01:48:07,471 --> 01:48:08,580
thought.
Yes.

2392
01:48:08,940 --> 01:48:12,330
And this,
if this branch of the bit might be a new

2393
01:48:12,331 --> 01:48:13,680
bit,
I have to listen to that bit again.

2394
01:48:14,060 --> 01:48:18,250
And so I'll clearly go over there and 
make sure that your common sense,

2395
01:48:18,300 --> 01:48:20,780
but it's so hard to do.
Yeah.

2396
01:48:20,790 --> 01:48:23,070
You're giving me the training right now 
of this stuff that's like,

2397
01:48:23,160 --> 01:48:25,860
obviously you remember when you went off
on that thing,

2398
01:48:25,861 --> 01:48:27,900
go back and listen to it and write it 
down.

2399
01:48:27,990 --> 01:48:30,480
Think about the things that you've said 
today that have helped you,

2400
01:48:30,481 --> 01:48:33,180
right?
Like how you've had to speak clearly,

2401
01:48:33,210 --> 01:48:34,920
do all these things and what did that 
come from?

2402
01:48:34,920 --> 01:48:35,753
Well that come from,
that comes from trial and error and 

2403
01:48:37,051 --> 01:48:39,900
focus like you're focusing on your act 
because of that.

2404
01:48:40,440 --> 01:48:41,273
That next level of focusing on your act 
is being like super diligent about 

2405
01:48:45,361 --> 01:48:48,560
recordings and writing and that's what a
lot of comics don't do it.

2406
01:48:48,561 --> 01:48:49,394
There's a lot of comics that think 
they're grinding and they'll say that 

2407
01:48:51,721 --> 01:48:52,920
I'm out there,
I'm doing a lot of sets.

2408
01:48:53,130 --> 01:48:54,540
They're not writing any new material 
though.

2409
01:48:55,020 --> 01:48:56,520
You can't.
You have to write.

2410
01:48:56,670 --> 01:48:58,890
You have to actually write.
That's what I believe.

2411
01:48:59,220 --> 01:49:00,053
Maybe maybe you can just write all on 
stage because you can trick yourself 

2412
01:49:02,791 --> 01:49:03,624
into thinking that you're grinding it 
out and maybe you are doing a lot of 

2413
01:49:05,461 --> 01:49:06,294
sets and maybe doing the same set.
You're doing it differently so you can 

2414
01:49:10,860 --> 01:49:12,630
and that's it.
That's fine.

2415
01:49:12,660 --> 01:49:15,720
That's its own thing.
But you're not going to come up with new

2416
01:49:15,721 --> 01:49:16,320
staff from that.

2417
01:49:16,320 --> 01:49:17,153
You're doing something,
but are you doing like everything you 

2418
01:49:20,011 --> 01:49:22,440
could be doing?
It's like it's like anything else.

2419
01:49:22,470 --> 01:49:25,890
The more time and enthusiasm you put on 
something,

2420
01:49:26,160 --> 01:49:26,993
the better you're going to get at it.
If you're a guy like save your bowler 

2421
01:49:29,940 --> 01:49:31,800
and you only like the bowl 40 minutes a 
day,

2422
01:49:31,801 --> 01:49:33,030
but you want to be the best in the 
world,

2423
01:49:33,270 --> 01:49:36,240
turn not gunna be,
I don't care what you want,

2424
01:49:36,450 --> 01:49:37,283
but the time and enthusiasm is that 
tricky part that goes back to like 

2425
01:49:40,170 --> 01:49:41,003
discipline.
Well also I was trying to make a bigger 

2426
01:49:45,510 --> 01:49:46,343
jump,
which is how do you connect to being 

2427
01:49:50,650 --> 01:49:52,690
enthusiastic?
If you don't,

2428
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:55,570
we'll think about how you were bummed 
out about your set,

2429
01:49:55,780 --> 01:49:56,613
right?
And you got to the store and you had a 

2430
01:49:57,371 --> 01:50:02,371
trick your brain into being more present
and more pumped up for your set.

2431
01:50:03,100 --> 01:50:05,530
Right.
And then when you did it was a joy.

2432
01:50:05,710 --> 01:50:06,543
I guess I'm trying to connect it to what
we were talking about earlier about 

2433
01:50:08,291 --> 01:50:09,124
people who get isolated and don't have 
friends and don't have a feedback and 

2434
01:50:12,311 --> 01:50:17,311
don't have those like tendrils of like 
being able to make that leap so that,

2435
01:50:19,150 --> 01:50:22,750
you know,
you start like eating yourself alive and

2436
01:50:23,170 --> 01:50:24,910
well,
I think with everything,

2437
01:50:24,940 --> 01:50:27,160
it's like a little stuff climb out of 
the barrel,

2438
01:50:27,161 --> 01:50:29,080
right?
If you're 300 pounds,

2439
01:50:29,110 --> 01:50:31,610
do not run a marathon,
right?

2440
01:50:31,840 --> 01:50:35,230
Walk around the block.
And if you're a person who's been living

2441
01:50:35,231 --> 01:50:38,350
your life with a bunch of fucking 
negative thinking in your head,

2442
01:50:38,740 --> 01:50:41,050
take steps in the right direction,
you know,

2443
01:50:41,080 --> 01:50:45,370
take a step back and you have to 
acknowledge that step today.

2444
01:50:45,371 --> 01:50:46,540
I mean,
I remember that.

2445
01:50:46,900 --> 01:50:49,090
I need to remember it and I need to 
build on that,

2446
01:50:49,300 --> 01:50:50,650
you know?
And you can do that.

2447
01:50:50,710 --> 01:50:51,640
Anybody can do that.

2448
01:50:51,640 --> 01:50:55,030
You could just do it incrementally.
I had a great podcast with this guy,

2449
01:50:55,031 --> 01:50:58,060
David Goggins.
Did you ever heard of him?

2450
01:50:58,420 --> 01:50:59,390
So,
um,

2451
01:50:59,830 --> 01:51:03,210
he's a navy seal who's also a famous 
tech podcast,

2452
01:51:03,220 --> 01:51:04,300
but yes,
yes.

2453
01:51:04,301 --> 01:51:06,550
I heard a bit of that.
And he was talking about how,

2454
01:51:06,580 --> 01:51:07,413
you know,
he was a fat loser who kept making 

2455
01:51:09,041 --> 01:51:09,874
excuses for himself and just like 
drinking chocolate milkshakes every day 

2456
01:51:13,170 --> 01:51:15,610
working for an exterminator and he was 
fat as fuck.

2457
01:51:15,611 --> 01:51:17,730
And they just decided I don't want to do
this any more.

2458
01:51:17,731 --> 01:51:20,720
And he had these moments where he went,
he went running,

2459
01:51:20,721 --> 01:51:21,554
he ran three quarters of a mile,
then he turned around and walked back 

2460
01:51:23,111 --> 01:51:24,940
home.
That was his first time running.

2461
01:51:24,941 --> 01:51:25,774
Like it wasn't quick that it became,
this guy runs a hundred miles at a time 

2462
01:51:28,870 --> 01:51:32,770
and he was doing,
how many fucking a hundred milers did he

2463
01:51:32,771 --> 01:51:33,604
do in a year?

2464
01:51:33,790 --> 01:51:37,890
Wasn't it crazy every week or every 
other week or every month?

2465
01:51:38,940 --> 01:51:41,440
It was insane because when he played it 
for,

2466
01:51:41,441 --> 01:51:43,690
he showed us the website and he was 
like,

2467
01:51:43,691 --> 01:51:45,130
these are all the ones he did in a year.
And it's like,

2468
01:51:45,131 --> 01:51:45,964
what the fuck?
Like every week or two weeks he was 

2469
01:51:47,980 --> 01:51:50,620
running a hundred miles like in the 
mountains and shit.

2470
01:51:50,800 --> 01:51:53,760
A hundred that's a 24 hour race.
Yeah.

2471
01:51:53,770 --> 01:51:56,380
And he was doing it every week.
That's fucking insane.

2472
01:51:57,310 --> 01:51:58,143
But this guy started out running three 
quarters of a mile and then he quit and 

2473
01:52:00,341 --> 01:52:01,174
turned around and walk back home cause 
he was fat and he's eating milkshakes 

2474
01:52:02,921 --> 01:52:05,860
every day.
Like that's the same guy he be.

2475
01:52:05,900 --> 01:52:06,733
He with these little incremental steps 
and then just deciding this is who I am 

2476
01:52:10,991 --> 01:52:11,824
now.
I'm a guy who does what I say I'm 

2477
01:52:12,971 --> 01:52:16,360
supposed to do and I'm fucking serious.
I'm going to change my life.

2478
01:52:16,630 --> 01:52:20,140
I always shredded just guys a fucking 
animal.

2479
01:52:20,170 --> 01:52:25,170
I mean he's just a pure a machine made 
out of like motivation and discipline.

2480
01:52:25,780 --> 01:52:27,640
Like you don't get more disciplined than
I am now,

2481
01:52:27,730 --> 01:52:28,563
but he wasn't at one point in time in 
his life and by him expressing that on 

2482
01:52:32,261 --> 01:52:34,760
the podcast and it's really 
inspirational podcasts.

2483
01:52:34,780 --> 01:52:37,360
I think it gives everybody hope cause 
you like to think that,

2484
01:52:37,390 --> 01:52:38,223
oh that guy who is really good at this 
thing or that guy was really mentally 

2485
01:52:41,681 --> 01:52:42,514
tough or this girl who's super 
disciplined who just get accomplishes 

2486
01:52:45,771 --> 01:52:45,980
thing

2487
01:52:45,980 --> 01:52:47,420
after thing.
She's always been like that,

2488
01:52:47,690 --> 01:52:48,140
don't,
no,

2489
01:52:48,140 --> 01:52:48,381
no,
no,

2490
01:52:48,381 --> 01:52:48,801
no.
She's,

2491
01:52:48,801 --> 01:52:51,420
nobody's always had been like that.
No one has you.

2492
01:52:51,430 --> 01:52:53,600
You start off fucking up,
you fail,

2493
01:52:53,720 --> 01:52:55,880
you move up,
you figure it out,

2494
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:57,650
you make some mistakes,
you fall back,

2495
01:52:57,710 --> 01:52:58,910
you get back up,
you go,

2496
01:52:58,911 --> 01:53:00,080
well,
that's not me.

2497
01:53:00,260 --> 01:53:02,270
I'm me now.
I realized,

2498
01:53:02,360 --> 01:53:04,910
don't do that anymore.
Now instead,

2499
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:06,500
don't quit after three quarters of a 
mile.

2500
01:53:06,590 --> 01:53:09,230
Now we're going to drink water instead 
of drinking chocolate shakes,

2501
01:53:09,410 --> 01:53:10,243
we're going to eat healthy food and 
tomorrow we're going to do a whole 

2502
01:53:12,021 --> 01:53:13,280
fucking mile.
Let's do it.

2503
01:53:13,520 --> 01:53:15,200
And then you do that mine like,
Holy Shit,

2504
01:53:15,201 --> 01:53:16,310
I did it.
Mark it down,

2505
01:53:16,311 --> 01:53:17,360
write it down,
did a mile,

2506
01:53:17,630 --> 01:53:18,463
and then maybe take a day off and then 
maybe the next day tried to do it again 

2507
01:53:20,480 --> 01:53:23,330
and then build with everything with 
comedy,

2508
01:53:23,690 --> 01:53:26,060
with fucking,
I'm sure that's the case with music,

2509
01:53:26,540 --> 01:53:27,390
with everything,
right?

2510
01:53:27,730 --> 01:53:29,540
And to recognize that that's your 
choice.

2511
01:53:29,720 --> 01:53:32,090
And I think of myself,
there are some mornings where I'm like,

2512
01:53:32,540 --> 01:53:34,470
I'm gonna sit and have a latte.
And you know,

2513
01:53:34,471 --> 01:53:36,350
now there are mornings where I'm in a 
workout.

2514
01:53:36,380 --> 01:53:37,213
Those are all my choices.
Maybe that one day you're going to be 

2515
01:53:39,471 --> 01:53:42,560
that person that just kind of sits there
and stares out the window.

2516
01:53:43,240 --> 01:53:44,240
Um,
you know,

2517
01:53:44,360 --> 01:53:48,200
that would not be work towards my 
hundred miles that I'm trying to run.

2518
01:53:48,260 --> 01:53:50,400
That would put,
it might be a day where you daydream,

2519
01:53:50,401 --> 01:53:53,570
he'd come up with an amazing idea and I 
kind of loved that.

2520
01:53:53,571 --> 01:53:57,320
I spent the day leading up to that 
standup on the spot.

2521
01:53:57,500 --> 01:54:00,440
Actually I thought we had our podcast 
was yesterday.

2522
01:54:00,441 --> 01:54:04,250
I had to go back into my text and I kind
of like,

2523
01:54:04,251 --> 01:54:05,084
you know how you do when you like have 
something to do at one so that I get 11 

2524
01:54:08,511 --> 01:54:09,344
you're like,
well I can't completely go do something 

2525
01:54:11,301 --> 01:54:11,540
else.

2526
01:54:11,540 --> 01:54:12,373
So I kinda just agonized.
And then it was like 12 and I loved and 

2527
01:54:16,191 --> 01:54:17,360
I was like,
oh,

2528
01:54:17,450 --> 01:54:20,780
it's not even today.
So now I like kind of like,

2529
01:54:21,500 --> 01:54:23,330
you know,
didn't do stuff.

2530
01:54:23,331 --> 01:54:27,020
I could have done it for a couple hours 
and now you know,

2531
01:54:27,200 --> 01:54:29,840
I thought we were podcasting,
so now I have all that time.

2532
01:54:29,841 --> 01:54:31,120
So I'm just like,
well,

2533
01:54:31,140 --> 01:54:33,140
have that stand up on the spot show 
tonight.

2534
01:54:33,141 --> 01:54:38,141
So I really was just looking down.
You go [inaudible] if worked out.

2535
01:54:41,451 --> 01:54:45,140
Yeah,
but this lady here she is.

2536
01:54:45,170 --> 01:54:46,310
Who Was it?
Pretty girl?

2537
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:50,360
Uh,
yeah,

2538
01:54:50,361 --> 01:54:51,194
so I weirdly,
but it was kind of a productive day 

2539
01:54:53,061 --> 01:54:57,650
because then when I got to the end and 
was so appreciative,

2540
01:54:57,920 --> 01:55:02,920
it made me so aware of the nightmare of 
my own head that I was the,

2541
01:55:03,140 --> 01:55:07,040
I was very conscious of what I,
what I was doing.

2542
01:55:08,840 --> 01:55:09,920
That got me to that.

2543
01:55:09,920 --> 01:55:10,753
Then when it was so easy,
it really was like waking up from a bad 

2544
01:55:14,001 --> 01:55:15,470
dream when you're like,
oh,

2545
01:55:16,010 --> 01:55:16,843
this is life.
It's not that being engaged and being 

2546
01:55:20,811 --> 01:55:21,644
present and going to do this thing.
It was nothing like what I was beating 

2547
01:55:25,701 --> 01:55:27,140
myself up.
Like,

2548
01:55:28,130 --> 01:55:30,060
why are you doing that?
What is that?

2549
01:55:30,070 --> 01:55:32,660
What is that?
Why you say you've done so many shows?

2550
01:55:32,661 --> 01:55:34,400
But I wasn't even acknowledging that 
history.

2551
01:55:34,401 --> 01:55:35,234
I was just stewing in almost because I 
had the time and I just let that run 

2552
01:55:40,011 --> 01:55:42,260
rampant in my head.
That voice of like,

2553
01:55:42,620 --> 01:55:44,130
Oh really?

2554
01:55:44,550 --> 01:55:46,650
You think you,
you think you can construct a joke?

2555
01:55:46,680 --> 01:55:50,130
Good luck.
You know why?

2556
01:55:51,170 --> 01:55:54,060
Right?
Why did I just feed that monster?

2557
01:55:55,440 --> 01:55:56,273
Yeah.
It's just a common strategy that people 

2558
01:55:59,761 --> 01:56:03,440
do to avoid accomplishing things.
Right.

2559
01:56:03,600 --> 01:56:07,320
And you do it subconsciously to give 
yourself a little bit of a break because

2560
01:56:07,321 --> 01:56:10,170
the pressure of like being disciplined 
and doing things,

2561
01:56:10,560 --> 01:56:12,300
it's hard.
It weighs on you.

2562
01:56:12,890 --> 01:56:16,170
Right.
So then that becomes an excuse to not,

2563
01:56:16,440 --> 01:56:19,650
we were talking before the podcast about
yoga and I was saying how,

2564
01:56:19,710 --> 01:56:20,543
um,
when I did that 15 days in a month 

2565
01:56:23,131 --> 01:56:23,964
thing,
I decided to end it with nine days in a 

2566
01:56:25,651 --> 01:56:27,480
row.
So I just did nine days.

2567
01:56:27,481 --> 01:56:28,950
He,
I ended like a week early.

2568
01:56:28,951 --> 01:56:31,440
I finished like a week earlier,
like five days early,

2569
01:56:31,441 --> 01:56:35,850
but I did nine fucking days of yoga in a
row to end it.

2570
01:56:35,851 --> 01:56:36,870
And I was like,
this is crazy.

2571
01:56:36,870 --> 01:56:39,900
I never would've thought,
not only that I could do it,

2572
01:56:39,960 --> 01:56:43,050
I mean I know I could physically do it.
It's not impossible,

2573
01:56:43,200 --> 01:56:46,500
but I didn't think I'd ever like fall 
through and do that.

2574
01:56:46,501 --> 01:56:47,334
It just seems too extreme.
And that was the beaker him that the 

2575
01:56:49,401 --> 01:56:50,234
half.
Yeah.

2576
01:56:50,400 --> 01:56:51,260
Which people are like,
Ooh,

2577
01:56:51,261 --> 01:56:52,920
I do it everyday.
I did 60 days in a row.

2578
01:56:52,921 --> 01:56:54,360
Yeah.
But I do like eight other things.

2579
01:56:54,750 --> 01:56:59,090
It's not easy to carve out an hour and a
half a fucking swinging dick off in this

2580
01:57:00,030 --> 01:57:00,990
workout.
Oh yeah.

2581
01:57:00,991 --> 01:57:02,460
I'm still,
I'm still lifting weights.

2582
01:57:03,100 --> 01:57:04,470
Yeah.
I'm still doing that too.

2583
01:57:04,530 --> 01:57:05,363
I'm not just doing yoga and I'm also 
doing writing and the podcast and 

2584
01:57:10,650 --> 01:57:12,210
whatever.
UFC shouldn't have to do.

2585
01:57:12,350 --> 01:57:16,170
Like I made myself do it too.
But in doing so,

2586
01:57:16,171 --> 01:57:17,820
I realized like,
Oh,

2587
01:57:17,821 --> 01:57:20,730
you just got to just do it.
Like you just got to say you're going to

2588
01:57:20,731 --> 01:57:21,930
do it and just do it.

2589
01:57:22,770 --> 01:57:26,280
Like I did a thing a while back in like 
2009,

2590
01:57:26,310 --> 01:57:27,520
but when I was writing,
um,

2591
01:57:28,320 --> 01:57:31,110
I was up getting ready to do a,
my comedy central special at the time,

2592
01:57:31,140 --> 01:57:33,300
or it was on spike tv than uncommon 
central.

2593
01:57:33,720 --> 01:57:34,410
I,
um,

2594
01:57:34,410 --> 01:57:37,470
I wrote every day for a month in my,
in my blog.

2595
01:57:37,800 --> 01:57:40,640
I just decided I'm gonna and I committed
to it online.

2596
01:57:40,641 --> 01:57:42,600
I said,
I'm gonna write every day for a month.

2597
01:57:42,960 --> 01:57:43,793
And in doing that,
I'm like,

2598
01:57:43,800 --> 01:57:44,550
oh,
I could do that.

2599
01:57:44,550 --> 01:57:45,600
Like you just got to do.
Let's,

2600
01:57:45,601 --> 01:57:45,901
uh,
let's,

2601
01:57:45,901 --> 01:57:47,700
uh,
it has to be just a thing you do.

2602
01:57:47,701 --> 01:57:48,181
Like,
oh,

2603
01:57:48,181 --> 01:57:49,650
I brushed my teeth.
Oh,

2604
01:57:49,651 --> 01:57:51,030
I comb my hair.
Oh,

2605
01:57:51,031 --> 01:57:52,230
I right.
Oh,

2606
01:57:52,231 --> 01:57:53,064
I get up and I run an while.
I get up and I lift weights for an hour 

2607
01:57:55,331 --> 01:57:58,560
or whatever the fuck it is.
Did the or did that yoga tip you one way

2608
01:57:58,561 --> 01:57:59,010
or the other?

2609
01:57:59,010 --> 01:58:04,010
Like make you more thirsty or more like 
tired or more in the day?

2610
01:58:05,110 --> 01:58:06,840
Yeah,
it definitely makes you thirsty.

2611
01:58:07,320 --> 01:58:09,090
He fucking does.
I sweat so much.

2612
01:58:10,090 --> 01:58:12,570
I can be like,
I couldn't drink coffee.

2613
01:58:12,571 --> 01:58:13,404
I just was like,
I need oranges and water and lemons and 

2614
01:58:16,291 --> 01:58:18,780
oranges and water when you sweat so 
much.

2615
01:58:18,781 --> 01:58:19,614
But does that,
did that affect your other workout that 

2616
01:58:21,361 --> 01:58:23,730
you do?
Like was your body just like stop?

2617
01:58:23,820 --> 01:58:25,260
No.
Drink a bunch of water?

2618
01:58:25,410 --> 01:58:26,280
No,
I mean it's,

2619
01:58:26,310 --> 01:58:27,920
it's easier because,
um,

2620
01:58:28,170 --> 01:58:30,660
if I was going to do the yoga,
I would,

2621
01:58:30,661 --> 01:58:31,494
uh,
I would just do stuff like lifting 

2622
01:58:32,671 --> 01:58:35,670
weights or something that night and 
lifting weights is,

2623
01:58:35,671 --> 01:58:38,310
um,
as opposed to running.

2624
01:58:38,360 --> 01:58:39,540
Yeah.
Sometimes I'd run,

2625
01:58:39,590 --> 01:58:40,423
I'd do.
I'd like to run though in the morning 

2626
01:58:41,381 --> 01:58:44,080
and do yoga later.
Like maybe I'll run at eight and then do

2627
01:58:44,081 --> 01:58:48,670
yoga at 10 30 I've done that because 
it's not a cardio thing really.

2628
01:58:48,700 --> 01:58:49,533
You know yoga and also like I like doing
yoga and my legs are burnt out cause 

2629
01:58:53,261 --> 01:58:56,050
then like I'd get more flexibility out 
of them.

2630
01:58:56,410 --> 01:59:00,820
I feel like your tissues get really beat
up and then they become more pliable.

2631
01:59:00,850 --> 01:59:03,700
If you could just force past that little
pain barrier,

2632
01:59:04,150 --> 01:59:04,983
you know?
I really like lifting weights and then 

2633
01:59:06,611 --> 01:59:07,444
going to yoga is amazing if you do like 
squats and stuff like that because your 

2634
01:59:10,751 --> 01:59:11,584
legs get like super warmed up and it 
just feels like they're exhausted and 

2635
01:59:15,191 --> 01:59:17,650
you just kind of pull that tissue a 
partier.

2636
01:59:19,200 --> 01:59:19,750
Yeah.

2637
01:59:19,750 --> 01:59:21,310
Yes,
yes.

2638
01:59:21,311 --> 01:59:24,010
Hashtag yes.
Hashtag fuck yeah.

2639
01:59:24,790 --> 01:59:26,320
All right Marilyn,
should we wrap this up?

2640
01:59:26,410 --> 01:59:28,570
Yeah,
I'm glad we did.

2641
01:59:28,571 --> 01:59:30,610
It shows you it again.
We should do this again.

2642
01:59:30,760 --> 01:59:32,110
Yeah,
I would love to have you on.

2643
01:59:32,470 --> 01:59:33,730
Have you thought about doing one of your
own?

2644
01:59:34,570 --> 01:59:36,430
Oh my gosh.
I'm going to leave here today going,

2645
01:59:36,431 --> 01:59:38,330
I got a podcast.
I've got a special on it.

2646
01:59:38,350 --> 01:59:41,320
Doing Yoga twice a day.
You should do a podcast for sure.

2647
01:59:41,710 --> 01:59:43,720
You could do it.
I would like to,

2648
01:59:44,080 --> 01:59:45,700
was talking about the second time you 
come back.
