1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:02,450
Hey fuckers.

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:03,653
What'd you do?

3
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:19,000
I'm excited just talking about it.

4
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,240
This is the only better idea I've
heard from you is our compound.

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,520
I want that's happening
in compounds happening.

6
00:00:24,521 --> 00:00:28,000
Aubrey's in Aubrey's done a better
idea ever more realistic idea.

7
00:00:28,001 --> 00:00:29,970
We'd have more realistic idea.

8
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:33,070
How can you say it's more
realistic because we're not
all going to like move our

9
00:00:33,071 --> 00:00:33,570
families.

10
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:34,290
Oh No,

11
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:34,420
no,

12
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:34,770
no.

13
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:35,920
This you don't understand.

14
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,180
This is the latest idea.

15
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,060
The ladies idea is we get a set up.

16
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,980
Why did you make condos gate?

17
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,380
It was at one point in time,

18
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:51,330
kind of used to be a manly word.

19
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,593
To me,

20
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:53,700
point of success.

21
00:00:53,701 --> 00:00:54,060
Well,

22
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,100
I've got a condo and I've got,

23
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:58,650
I can take her back to the condo.

24
00:00:58,651 --> 00:01:01,890
I leased a BMW three series and joy.

25
00:01:01,891 --> 00:01:05,850
Yet you specialize that word forever.

26
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,070
We've got,

27
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,230
do you realize that if you
fall into a black hole,

28
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,770
you will see the entire future of the
universe unfold in front of you and a

29
00:01:15,771 --> 00:01:20,150
matter of moments and you will emerge
into another space time created by the

30
00:01:20,151 --> 00:01:22,730
singularity of the black
hole you just fell into.

31
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,513
He just broke the,

32
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,540
broke the Hogan and that right there.

33
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:31,370
Can you imagine giving your son to
someone to hack his balls off so he could

34
00:01:31,371 --> 00:01:32,450
sing in a weird way?

35
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:33,481
People are so poor.

36
00:01:33,481 --> 00:01:34,051
Back then it was like,

37
00:01:34,051 --> 00:01:35,010
this is the only way out.

38
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:36,200
Oh my God.

39
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,510
Like opera was like white
people's basketball like that.

40
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:43,750
You have a chance to be a constraint.

41
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,160
If you have any marijuana
in your blood in Japan,

42
00:01:46,161 --> 00:01:47,000
you're not gonna be able to fight.

43
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:48,110
So what did you get arrested for?

44
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,033
Marijuana.

45
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,060
So what,

46
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:52,670
how,

47
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:53,750
like what is it like,

48
00:01:53,751 --> 00:01:55,760
is it like being caught with cocaine or

49
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,330
yeah,

50
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:57,430
to drugs.

51
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,440
That drug in Japan.

52
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,050
I was facing some bad time,

53
00:02:00,051 --> 00:02:00,231
you know,

54
00:02:00,231 --> 00:02:00,980
because uh,

55
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:04,580
I was a famous figure and they
wanted to make an example to me.

56
00:02:04,581 --> 00:02:06,180
So it was then the,

57
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:11,180
the interrogation came to finding
out where I got my stuff in Japan,

58
00:02:11,181 --> 00:02:14,240
if you throw everything
to a foreign person,

59
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:16,183
they'll drop.

60
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,190
They won't want to go
fight someone in America.

61
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:19,350
I,

62
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:24,350
I told him it was a student from Guam
and just they asked me for a name and I

63
00:02:25,641 --> 00:02:25,850
said,

64
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:26,683
Tony,

65
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,100
I knew like three Tonys and Guam,

66
00:02:28,101 --> 00:02:28,934
so

67
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,553
keep it real.

68
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,860
We had like two days of
questioning and late,

69
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:34,920
like the third day they said,

70
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:36,530
so happened caught me off guard man.

71
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:37,670
And the SP,

72
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:41,320
what's Tony's last name and
this fricken ridiculous,

73
00:02:41,321 --> 00:02:43,280
the first name that
popped the males Montana

74
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,280
read when I said,

75
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,590
Oh fuck if these guys watch scarf

76
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:55,943
[inaudible]

77
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:57,500
see I'm screwed,

78
00:02:57,501 --> 00:02:57,780
you know,

79
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:58,191
screwed.

80
00:02:58,191 --> 00:03:00,070
Because they'll start the all over if

81
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,040
I get kick on an ally.

82
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:01,480
Right,

83
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:01,751
right,

84
00:03:01,751 --> 00:03:02,150
right.

85
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:02,801
So he just,

86
00:03:02,801 --> 00:03:06,880
I saw him write it down in Japanese in
Montana and then he just started down and

87
00:03:06,881 --> 00:03:07,714
I was like,

88
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,120
car face.

89
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:11,740
Not that popular.

90
00:03:11,741 --> 00:03:13,030
I don't think it's that popular there.

91
00:03:13,031 --> 00:03:13,331
Yeah.

92
00:03:13,331 --> 00:03:15,490
But how long was it was worth the trip in

93
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:18,370
you?

94
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:19,780
I hug all my friends.

95
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,440
Right.

96
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,240
This is the most awkward guy ever.

97
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:22,840
He's like,

98
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,060
Yo,

99
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:23,680
shell the title.

100
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,370
But he's like,

101
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,070
he,

102
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:26,020
he wasn't there.

103
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,493
Alright.

104
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:33,623
Alright.

105
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:40,290
Jesus.

106
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:44,190
That lazy gentleman was a
gas moment in our podcast.

107
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:49,590
My belief is all of us have all of us
create what we need to work through to

108
00:03:50,801 --> 00:03:53,410
create and learn what we
need to in this world.

109
00:03:53,411 --> 00:03:55,780
And so I can't look at anyone as a victim.

110
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,720
I can't even a child.

111
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,700
I don't blame them.

112
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,241
I don't say,

113
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,260
this is your fault.

114
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,233
I say,

115
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,220
you made an agreement

116
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:12,720
in this place to do this and I am sending
you all my love and I believe in you

117
00:04:14,111 --> 00:04:15,250
and I believe that you will.

118
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:17,110
You can be a miracle.

119
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:19,090
Okay?

120
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:21,760
I mean like who's to say how
you should live this life?

121
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:22,361
It's fucking,

122
00:04:22,361 --> 00:04:23,170
I'll do it.

123
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:23,921
It's temporary.

124
00:04:23,921 --> 00:04:24,280
Oreo,

125
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:24,700
right?

126
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:24,791
Oh,

127
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:28,330
you should be the ones who
are wondering totally down.

128
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,100
Let's just start with you over that.

129
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:31,300
We should start with you and examine,

130
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:31,991
examine your,

131
00:04:31,991 --> 00:04:33,520
your behavior at the Tsa.

132
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:34,610
I say I can't do it.

133
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,410
Medical condition.

134
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:35,770
Okay,

135
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:36,340
go this way.

136
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:36,790
Okay.

137
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:37,390
If they say,

138
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,260
are you opting out?

139
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:38,950
I was like,

140
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:39,900
I don't know what that means.

141
00:04:39,901 --> 00:04:40,211
When I say,

142
00:04:40,211 --> 00:04:41,820
do you not want that or
do you want a pat down on?

143
00:04:41,821 --> 00:04:42,281
I don't know.

144
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:43,240
I don't want to pat down,

145
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,290
but I'm not doing that thing.

146
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:45,551
So what am I options?

147
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:46,900
He's just trying to be Larry David.

148
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,171
No,

149
00:04:47,171 --> 00:04:51,160
I'm just trying to not let them take
away these freedoms from me without going

150
00:04:51,161 --> 00:04:52,240
down with a little bit of a fight.

151
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,420
But you had Kimbo in fucking side control.

152
00:04:55,421 --> 00:04:56,410
You work to get it.

153
00:04:56,411 --> 00:04:56,840
You got,

154
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,030
you were a dominant position.

155
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:02,530
He was tired and they
stood you back up bitches.

156
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,170
We did a,

157
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:04,940
um,

158
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:05,930
a video interview,

159
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:06,301
you know,

160
00:05:06,301 --> 00:05:07,670
where everyone is on the other line.

161
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,470
And I've just finished training,

162
00:05:09,471 --> 00:05:10,304
so I'm on the phone.

163
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:10,900
I want to,

164
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,770
no one was asking me
fucking any questions.

165
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:13,903
Um,

166
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,690
and I thought,

167
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:14,931
yeah,

168
00:05:14,931 --> 00:05:15,770
I'm just the guy.

169
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,143
Kimbo tepee.

170
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:18,020
So Amanda,

171
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:18,540
someone asked,

172
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,371
go show a question.

173
00:05:19,371 --> 00:05:19,930
They said,

174
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:20,390
um,

175
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,890
what would you do with James Thompson won?

176
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:22,610
And he said,

177
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:23,510
I'd hung myself.

178
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,873
And I thought,

179
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,790
wow.

180
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,020
Okay.

181
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:30,410
What's the most money you've ever gambled
the most I've ever lost in one night?

182
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:32,270
Yeah.

183
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,210
$8 tomorrow.

184
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:33,561
Okay.

185
00:05:33,561 --> 00:05:34,710
What's the most you've ever lost someone?

186
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:35,613
1 million bucks.

187
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:36,480
Oh my.

188
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:40,870
Oh

189
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:41,660
my.

190
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:42,111
How much is it?

191
00:05:42,111 --> 00:05:43,040
What's the most you've ever won?

192
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:43,903
6 million.

193
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,250
Okay.

194
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,930
Oh,

195
00:05:45,931 --> 00:05:46,060
oh

196
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,340
Jesus.

197
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,250
Is it true that the reason why
we don't go back to the palms,

198
00:05:50,251 --> 00:05:52,470
it's because they cut back your a,

199
00:05:52,471 --> 00:05:54,750
your gambling budget because
you were killing him.

200
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:55,643
I go,

201
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:56,070
yeah.

202
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:56,580
Really?

203
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,413
Yeah.

204
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:58,410
That seems ridiculous.

205
00:05:58,411 --> 00:05:58,840
I got into,

206
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,200
but that's the way Vegas says now.

207
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:00,741
I mean,

208
00:06:00,741 --> 00:06:01,730
I guess the one film,

209
00:06:01,731 --> 00:06:04,070
I recommend that everyone is Killa season.

210
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,690
All the dips said dudes are in it.

211
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,950
It's like the worst made [inaudible].

212
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:08,751
Oh,

213
00:06:08,751 --> 00:06:10,330
you don't listen to the Dipset.

214
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,241
Oh,

215
00:06:11,241 --> 00:06:11,470
she's,

216
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:14,060
anyone here does ongoing shit.

217
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:14,910
What the dip set is?

218
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:15,081
Yo,

219
00:06:15,081 --> 00:06:16,340
y'all don't know the dip set.

220
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:17,690
Y'All don't know the dip.

221
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,590
My grandfather's rolling over,

222
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:20,000
man.

223
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,130
I tell you these fucking kids today.

224
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,233
Wow.

225
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:38,203
Okay.

226
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,630
That little pink freak me out.

227
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,910
Gucci Mane is crazy.

228
00:06:41,911 --> 00:06:42,570
Look at him.

229
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:44,760
He put an ice cream cone on his face.

230
00:06:44,761 --> 00:06:45,594
It says burr.

231
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,613
You see it?

232
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,000
You see it on the cone.

233
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,260
Be Our,

234
00:06:49,261 --> 00:06:49,681
our,

235
00:06:49,681 --> 00:06:51,390
our and the taxi guy.

236
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:51,691
I was like,

237
00:06:51,691 --> 00:06:52,350
okay,

238
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,061
call it ice.

239
00:06:53,061 --> 00:06:53,431
Matt,

240
00:06:53,431 --> 00:06:55,080

241
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:55,470

242
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:55,831
I want,

243
00:06:55,831 --> 00:06:56,221
I'm going to get,

244
00:06:56,221 --> 00:07:00,510
have to get you to request this on
video and then I need you to get,

245
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:01,860
I need you to write this down.

246
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:02,851
Come on man.

247
00:07:02,851 --> 00:07:03,684
Just tattoo it.

248
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,810
I ain't gonna change my mind on my face,

249
00:07:06,811 --> 00:07:07,410
man.

250
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:08,430
I want a cone.

251
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,593
A good one.

252
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,200
Like a waffle type motherfucker scrape.

253
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:20,670
Craziest par lightening
bolt on my ice cream.

254
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,690
It looks like it under his,

255
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:22,860
I said something.

256
00:07:22,861 --> 00:07:23,760
What the fuck?

257
00:07:23,761 --> 00:07:24,594
Bop.

258
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:25,161
Honda's.

259
00:07:25,161 --> 00:07:25,540
But yeah,

260
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,990
that dude is probably irrational.

261
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:31,250
Gucci Kiyoshi No,

262
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:32,123
Tom Day.

263
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,890
No hotel guys try.

264
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,390
What did you just look at?

265
00:07:36,391 --> 00:07:37,230
Hartford teacher.

266
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,413
Got It.

267
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:44,683
What does that,

268
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:46,250
it's from gangster movies and shit.

269
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:47,163
Do you think you're talking

270
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:50,241
Ruskin?

271
00:07:50,241 --> 00:07:52,010
I didn't do this to be mean.

272
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:54,650
I just did this because that's my nature.

273
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,450
I am the Scorpion.

274
00:07:56,451 --> 00:07:57,560
You are the frog.

275
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:59,150
This is how shit goes down.

276
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:00,763
Matt.

277
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,070
Just tell him you love him.

278
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,673
Matt,

279
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:11,170
have you ever watched a Rodeo
and felt sorry for the bowls?

280
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:14,130
Nothing.

281
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:16,290
One of the stories he tells us about this,

282
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,070
uh,

283
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,030
Eskimo guy,

284
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:19,590
old guy.

285
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:23,580
And the family sort of took the keys
to the car away from him that like you

286
00:08:23,581 --> 00:08:24,880
can't go anymore.

287
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,290
They were afraid he would go
out and die the traditional way.

288
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:30,390
When Eskimo people got old,

289
00:08:30,391 --> 00:08:32,820
they were just like wander
off into the ice and die,

290
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,070
so as not to be a burden to the family.

291
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:37,590
And so that night he goes out,

292
00:08:37,591 --> 00:08:39,150
it gets out of the house,

293
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,700
takes a shit in his hand,

294
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:44,520
forms the shit into a knife,

295
00:08:44,521 --> 00:08:49,521
blade spits on it and the spit a is
freezing along the edge and he hones that

296
00:08:52,501 --> 00:08:52,741
down.

297
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:55,170
So he gets a nice sharp
edge with his sped,

298
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,630
takes his shit knife,

299
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,800
kills a dog or a couple
of dogs and takes their,

300
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:02,610
uh,

301
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:05,310
ribs and makes us a sled out of it.

302
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,860
And with the sinews and whatever other
pieces of the dogs hooks up a couple

303
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:12,420
other dogs to the sled
and he takes off into the,

304
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:14,460
into the snow on his,

305
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,713
you know,

306
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,340
sled with his shit knife.

307
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:18,303
Wow.

308
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,010
Oh my God.

309
00:09:21,011 --> 00:09:23,230
That might be the most of the
same story I've ever heard.

310
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:23,701
I had a,

311
00:09:23,701 --> 00:09:24,860
I had an incident,

312
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:25,401
uh,

313
00:09:25,401 --> 00:09:25,701
on a,

314
00:09:25,701 --> 00:09:28,400
on the airplane going to
Indianapolis where this,

315
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,234
this guy,

316
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:34,580
like I just guy just started
like interrogating me.

317
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,230
He thought it was some
sort of flight risk.

318
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:39,140
It just sitting there and he just says,

319
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:39,681
he goes,

320
00:09:39,681 --> 00:09:39,861
hey,

321
00:09:39,861 --> 00:09:41,150
you were you afraid to fly?

322
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:41,751
And he goes,

323
00:09:41,751 --> 00:09:42,584
how could he goes out?

324
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:42,830
Why?

325
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:44,120
Why are you going to Indianapolis Bill?

326
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:44,661
I'm like,

327
00:09:44,661 --> 00:09:44,841
yeah,

328
00:09:44,841 --> 00:09:46,310
I don't have to answer your questions.

329
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:46,731
He goes,

330
00:09:46,731 --> 00:09:48,110
you don't answer my questions right now.

331
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,250
I'm going to hit that call button.

332
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,830
I will stop this plane and
you will be fucking arrested.

333
00:09:51,831 --> 00:09:54,950
Like saying all this stuff and I'm just
sitting there and he's yapping in my

334
00:09:54,951 --> 00:09:55,784
ear.

335
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:56,460
He was,

336
00:09:56,460 --> 00:10:00,230
you thinks this is fucking over there
with a blindfold on laughing at him.

337
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,450
It was driving him fucking nuts.

338
00:10:02,451 --> 00:10:04,070
It was great riding them
starting to nod off.

339
00:10:04,071 --> 00:10:07,070
I just hear why he'd go
into Indianapolis spill.

340
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,420
I just laugh.

341
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,450
There's certain people that they have
music laying around just because it's

342
00:10:15,451 --> 00:10:16,170
cool.

343
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:17,010
I'm tons of them.

344
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:19,560
The worst being the Tom Waits era.

345
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,790
Those motherfuckers are ones I want
to punch him right in the fucking face

346
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:27,230
because they're the ones you having a
good time listening to something your

347
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:30,390
Bible and they want to like
really impressed like some
fucking dumped chick with

348
00:10:30,391 --> 00:10:31,260
freckles or something.

349
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,260
Everybody's fucked already.

350
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,061
Know what I'm saying?

351
00:10:34,061 --> 00:10:35,080
Everybody fucked all.

352
00:10:35,081 --> 00:10:36,810
You need this Tequila and a gram of blow.

353
00:10:36,811 --> 00:10:38,760
She'll be sucking your
dick in a fucking bathroom.

354
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,790
You want to be cool and
let's the Tom Waits.

355
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,550
Everyone's a time.

356
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,383
Wait.

357
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:44,263
Um,

358
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:46,150
yeah,

359
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:46,800
I don't like it.

360
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,640
That's good thing.

361
00:10:47,641 --> 00:10:49,320
And you want that you're fucking idiot.

362
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:53,490
But the only reason that people would
put that shit on is to try to overpower

363
00:10:53,491 --> 00:10:55,500
you with that fucking star wars.

364
00:10:55,501 --> 00:10:56,334
What do you call that?

365
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:57,840
The fucking thing with the mind.

366
00:10:58,490 --> 00:10:59,323
The Mind Jack.

367
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,033
That's it.

368
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:01,261
Oh,

369
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:02,040
he's so,

370
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:02,701
oh my God.

371
00:11:02,701 --> 00:11:03,481
He likes Tom.

372
00:11:03,481 --> 00:11:03,690
Wait,

373
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:04,330
listen to that.

374
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,110
They're trying to shut you down
with a gun next to your head.

375
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,520
You're telling me if that's true.

376
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:09,773
That's good.

377
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:10,771
That's good.

378
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:11,640
Fucking second.

379
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:12,880
That's the Beatles.

380
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,220
Y'All fucking shoot.

381
00:11:14,221 --> 00:11:17,210
You can put a gun to your bucket at all.

382
00:11:17,211 --> 00:11:17,670
Right.

383
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:18,990
Telling me that's good music.

384
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:20,580
You're fucking 20 years old.

385
00:11:20,581 --> 00:11:21,270
Not at all.

386
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:23,460
Like when somebody says I
like the Dave Matthews Band,

387
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,930
I will pistol whip you.

388
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,830
He's beauty.

389
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,880
He just find my yard.

390
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:35,370
I swear he is to look at me.

391
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,350
He was my friend.

392
00:11:37,351 --> 00:11:39,210
I know that sounds retarded.

393
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,490
But you are afraid of aliens though,

394
00:11:41,491 --> 00:11:42,210
right?

395
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:42,511
Yeah.

396
00:11:42,511 --> 00:11:47,511
My first a path mapped out in your house
had to get out of the aliens show up.

397
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:52,760
That's the rumor man.

398
00:11:52,761 --> 00:11:53,600
That's heard.

399
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:54,040
I

400
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,460
heard you have a plan because I
know you like to use game plans,

401
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,170
so I figured he's had an alien.

402
00:11:59,440 --> 00:11:59,801
I know,

403
00:11:59,801 --> 00:12:02,950
I know cat ready and I know
Jujitsu all didn't show up.

404
00:12:02,951 --> 00:12:05,710
I put a triangle choke
on him and I also have,

405
00:12:05,711 --> 00:12:06,640
I kept that as well,

406
00:12:06,641 --> 00:12:08,030
so I kept that to a Japanese get,

407
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:08,921
I'll see if they come,

408
00:12:08,921 --> 00:12:10,090
I can slice them apart.

409
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,300
You've um,

410
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:12,850
you've kicked the green bitch.

411
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:14,860
Yes.

412
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,641
Yes.

413
00:12:15,641 --> 00:12:20,110
After a 24 year intense
relationship with the,

414
00:12:20,111 --> 00:12:20,550
uh,

415
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:23,290
the green goddess or the Green Bitch,

416
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:24,820
depending on what mood she's in.

417
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,380
I had to stop.

418
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,190
Um,

419
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:28,023
and uh,

420
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:29,860
I've come in for some,

421
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,150
I've convinced for some,

422
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:36,240
some criticism for this and I
feel it's important to say that,

423
00:12:38,081 --> 00:12:38,470
uh,

424
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:42,070
I hugely value and love cannabis.

425
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:46,050
I think it's a wonderful
herbal ally and I think that,

426
00:12:46,051 --> 00:12:49,810
I don't think that I would ever have
written my books off historical mystery if

427
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:52,300
I had not encountered cannabis.

428
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,620
But like you mean you guys are
both in better shape than I am,

429
00:12:54,621 --> 00:12:56,060
but I work out 45 minutes a month.

430
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:58,310
I do my whole body vibration
45 minutes a month.

431
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:59,151
I'm not kidding.

432
00:12:59,151 --> 00:13:02,520
I do high end had a
minute less ridiculous.

433
00:13:02,521 --> 00:13:03,650
That's five times more than me.

434
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:06,850
Really?

435
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:07,730
You too busy.

436
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,920
I have some theories
about that I was doing,

437
00:13:09,921 --> 00:13:12,260
I invented bulletproof intermittent
fasting during that time,

438
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,930
which is when you do bulletproof
coffee during an intermittent fast,

439
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:16,191
I'm sorry,

440
00:13:16,191 --> 00:13:19,020
but you could be a hilarious
Saturday night live sketch too.

441
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,420
You get any more famous,

442
00:13:20,421 --> 00:13:22,720
you're in trouble because we didn't
do a sketch where everything,

443
00:13:22,721 --> 00:13:24,630
I'm going to take a bulletproof shit.

444
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,770
Then I'm going to get my bullet proof
car and go to the bulletproof office.

445
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,510
You know,

446
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:30,110
this is my bulletproof secretary.

447
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,520
I'll stop bulletproofing stuff,

448
00:13:31,521 --> 00:13:31,850
Joe,

449
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,050
but no more.

450
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,153
All right,

451
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,360
fair enough.

452
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,710
I got a buddy who's a billionaire,

453
00:13:36,711 --> 00:13:37,910
real live billionaire.

454
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:38,863
So

455
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:43,930
years later he came into the money like
where it was his in one year he went

456
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:46,850
from fucking Zenith,

457
00:13:46,851 --> 00:13:47,360
the Nadir,

458
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,193
like he,

459
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,150
he straight to Rehab.

460
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:50,750
He was,

461
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:51,650
he would call me and be like,

462
00:13:51,651 --> 00:13:52,430
I'm in Vegas.

463
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:54,050
I've got the top floor of the wind rented.

464
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,270
I get slip and slides down the hallway.

465
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:56,980
There's,

466
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,850
there's strippers and hookers everywhere.

467
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:03,110
And we got midgets in a storm trooper
outfit serving a strengths and he'd be

468
00:14:03,111 --> 00:14:03,410
like,

469
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:04,760
all of a private jet picking you up.

470
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:05,360
Get here.

471
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,370
Now how much money did he inherit?

472
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,470
A bout $5 billion.

473
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:13,040
Oh my goodness.

474
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:15,081
Oh my goodness.

475
00:14:15,081 --> 00:14:16,000
And he's not fun anymore.

476
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,390
It's the best clip.

477
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:18,380
All right,

478
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,213
we'll do this.

479
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:24,060
And you see kids running
with their elbows out,

480
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:25,021
right.

481
00:14:25,021 --> 00:14:25,950
Like RTD too.

482
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:26,390
Two.

483
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:26,670
Right.

484
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:27,241
That's a test.

485
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:28,830
That's c three Po runs with his arms out.

486
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,071
Yeah.

487
00:14:29,071 --> 00:14:31,170
What is the r two d two doesn't have arms.

488
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:32,670
I'm just letting you talk to him.

489
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:33,504
All right.

490
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:34,743
I'll try

491
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:36,900
to stay in your hair.

492
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:37,733
I'm fine.

493
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,760
The Opening Act upchuck uh,

494
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,160
the clown is trying to calm my nerves now.

495
00:14:44,161 --> 00:14:44,790
There's,

496
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:45,540
there's no,

497
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:45,751
you know,

498
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:46,290
they have their,

499
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:46,531
their,

500
00:14:46,531 --> 00:14:47,550
their own security.

501
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,200
So there's no security.

502
00:14:49,201 --> 00:14:50,034
It's just,

503
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:55,280
it's just juggle a law and this huge
piece of property up trying to convince me

504
00:14:56,181 --> 00:14:58,070
that it's not that scary of a Gig.

505
00:14:58,071 --> 00:15:00,440
And he's driving me around on
this golf cart and he's like,

506
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:00,831
you know,

507
00:15:00,831 --> 00:15:01,461
you got it.

508
00:15:01,461 --> 00:15:02,730
And this huge cloud,

509
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:03,823
just,

510
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:07,850
this guy just jumps out of nowhere
and starts punching up chuck.

511
00:15:07,851 --> 00:15:08,580
I'm the golf guy.

512
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:11,060
He's running along and
it ain't for no reason.

513
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:11,421
He's like,

514
00:15:11,421 --> 00:15:12,254
fuck you.

515
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,180
Fuck you.

516
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:15,790
I'm in shock.

517
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:16,630
And he just hit a day.

518
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:17,000
Yeah.

519
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,390
And he's gunning it and the guy said,

520
00:15:19,391 --> 00:15:20,071
we lose the game.

521
00:15:20,071 --> 00:15:20,550
And he's like,

522
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,210
ah,

523
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:21,590
ah,

524
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:22,640
I'm here every year.

525
00:15:22,641 --> 00:15:22,941
You know,

526
00:15:22,941 --> 00:15:23,631
they know me,

527
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:24,620
I'm like family.

528
00:15:24,621 --> 00:15:25,454
And I'm like,

529
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:25,881
okay.

530
00:15:25,881 --> 00:15:30,290
So He's trying to convince me this can
affect the first kind of fake what comes

531
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:32,780
in and it just sprays all over us.

532
00:15:32,781 --> 00:15:33,614
And uh,

533
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,970
and he's like,

534
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,960
he's so familiar with
getting hit with Paygo Cola.

535
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:38,630
He goes,

536
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:39,081
he goes,

537
00:15:39,081 --> 00:15:39,740
uh,

538
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,220
uh,

539
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:40,971
it's diet.

540
00:15:40,971 --> 00:15:41,830
It's not going to stay.

541
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:43,970
I swear to God.

542
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,830
Then one comes in and in the o nine,

543
00:15:46,831 --> 00:15:48,250
he's got it on camera.

544
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:49,520
It's like the Zapruder film.

545
00:15:49,521 --> 00:15:51,320
We got this can of soda.

546
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:56,810
This guy does a baseball pitch and you
see it whizzing seconds before it hits

547
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,131
the temple.

548
00:15:58,131 --> 00:15:58,930
No.

549
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:01,730
[inaudible] it's lump sum for the wheel.

550
00:16:01,731 --> 00:16:02,564
And he goes,

551
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,410
I'm hurt.

552
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:04,640
I'm hurt bad by the way.

553
00:16:04,641 --> 00:16:05,510
He's mid sentence,

554
00:16:05,511 --> 00:16:05,960
I guess,

555
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,351
you know,

556
00:16:06,351 --> 00:16:07,250
something like that.

557
00:16:07,251 --> 00:16:07,810
When the soda,

558
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:11,190
is that going to happen at a
Dave Matthews correc and slump.

559
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,080
So He's like,

560
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:13,100
I'm hurt.

561
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,510
I'm hurt bad Bob.

562
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:15,381
He's calling me Bob.

563
00:16:15,381 --> 00:16:16,640
So I know he's really fucked up,

564
00:16:16,641 --> 00:16:17,474
not bobcat.

565
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:19,450
We walk in and you know,

566
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,141
everyone's gone,

567
00:16:20,141 --> 00:16:23,860
but Sam and like three other people
and they're still doing blow.

568
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,990
I first walked into the kitchen
and walked back to the room.

569
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:29,290
I see the doors open.

570
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:30,910
All the guitars are gone.

571
00:16:30,911 --> 00:16:31,930
My bed's fucked up.

572
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:35,110
Like the door had been broken and kicked
in and Sam looks at me and goes up

573
00:16:35,111 --> 00:16:35,950
pissed on your bed.

574
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:36,803
Mer,

575
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:38,020
you want to know why?

576
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:39,220
And I go,

577
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:39,740
yeah,

578
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,301
yeah I do.

579
00:16:40,301 --> 00:16:40,661
He goes,

580
00:16:40,661 --> 00:16:42,140
cause you at that fucking moron.

581
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,660
Sleep with my guitars.

582
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:45,190
And like,

583
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:46,390
then there's this word silence.

584
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,040
And I turned to bill and I said,

585
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:49,150
I told you I knew him.

586
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:51,450
Huh?

587
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:53,050
I could do John Mayer did to too.

588
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:53,281
No,

589
00:16:53,281 --> 00:16:53,970
I think he's great.

590
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:54,840
I think he's very talented.

591
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,520
But if your wife is really into going,

592
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:57,511
you know what I'm saying?

593
00:16:57,511 --> 00:16:59,370
Like she dragged you there
and just stares at him.

594
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:00,993
Right?

595
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,270
Boob bless you.

596
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:05,130
Notice she's not clapping because
when her hands slipped down her genes,

597
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:07,830
she's his knuckle deep.

598
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,153
Oh,

599
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,063
so sad.

600
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,090
It sounds like someone's stabbing of seal.

601
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:16,303
Just

602
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,800
she's just Fiserv herself.

603
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:21,390
She's all the way to her elbow.

604
00:17:21,391 --> 00:17:23,760
Just grounded it in there.

605
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,580
You can see her rib cage expand as a fist.

606
00:17:26,581 --> 00:17:27,414
Goes up there

607
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,690
fucking love you.

608
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:36,821
Okay.

609
00:17:36,821 --> 00:17:37,654
Let's go.

610
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,940
And if you break down humor like that,

611
00:17:39,941 --> 00:17:40,361
like you said,

612
00:17:40,361 --> 00:17:41,320
fine tooth comb,

613
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:45,610
every single joke where
90% of the jokes you do,

614
00:17:45,611 --> 00:17:48,130
unless you're talking about
balloons are bouncing a ball,

615
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:49,560
have hurt somebody.

616
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:54,620
If we get that literal with humor than
almost all jokes comics tell are going to

617
00:17:55,861 --> 00:17:59,010
be up for a a careful examination.

618
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:03,780
Contributing to a fucking rape culture
is nonsense and it is to say comedian

619
00:18:03,781 --> 00:18:07,530
contributes to rape culture is simply
bullshit and it's simplistic thinking.

620
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,450
It's a way of saying,

621
00:18:09,451 --> 00:18:12,420
I don't like what you're saying
and I don't want you to say it,

622
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:13,920
but I can't come out with that.

623
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:17,640
So I have to find a higher reason which
makes it sound like you shouldn't say

624
00:18:17,641 --> 00:18:17,761
it.

625
00:18:17,761 --> 00:18:18,360
For this reason,

626
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,460
as the ban against these weapons roads,

627
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:25,470
other tyrants will have no reason to
think twice about acquiring poison gas and

628
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:29,040
using them cheeses over time
where the troops were again,

629
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,030
face the prospect.

630
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:30,630
Honestly,

631
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:31,710
we don't attack the area.

632
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:32,970
I'm going to get some poison gas.

633
00:18:32,971 --> 00:18:36,570
It could be easier for
terrorist organizations and
the day after any military

634
00:18:36,571 --> 00:18:37,404
action,

635
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:42,090
we would redouble our efforts to achieve
a political solution that strengthens

636
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:45,510
those who reject the forces
of tyranny and extremism.

637
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:47,000
Biden beat me at poker.

638
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:48,290
He used to run Raytheon.

639
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:48,880
They sell how?

640
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,760
Hellfire missiles.

641
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:51,831
Oh,

642
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:52,491
now he's leaving.

643
00:18:52,491 --> 00:18:53,450
The same way came in.

644
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,380
Oh my God.

645
00:18:54,381 --> 00:18:56,480
Nice and dramatic that just that alone,

646
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,030
all of this ready attrical
shit was orchestrated.

647
00:18:59,031 --> 00:18:59,660
Folks,

648
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:02,300
I guarantee you there are some
people that are involved in this.

649
00:19:02,301 --> 00:19:03,500
There's some producers,

650
00:19:03,501 --> 00:19:03,920
there's some,

651
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,020
there's an artistic director they want.

652
00:19:06,021 --> 00:19:06,351
That was a,

653
00:19:06,351 --> 00:19:08,540
that was a well planned out scene.

654
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,583
He walks up,

655
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:10,970
he walks back.

656
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,300
The fact that they do it in this ancient
stupid house where he supposedly lives.

657
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:14,871
Meanwhile,

658
00:19:14,871 --> 00:19:19,670
you know he's in some fucking seven mile
thick bunker down deep into the ground.

659
00:19:19,671 --> 00:19:22,880
The bowels of the Earth where Dick
Cheney was hiding all throughout the Iraq

660
00:19:22,881 --> 00:19:23,470
war.

661
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:23,961
I remember,

662
00:19:23,961 --> 00:19:26,220
here's just a metal slide
he jumps in and look at.

663
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:26,961
It's a shoot,

664
00:19:26,961 --> 00:19:28,160
like a laundry chute,

665
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:33,850
jumps in and slides through the lens and
the towels and just go some cell phone

666
00:19:33,851 --> 00:19:37,070
off and surrounded by lizards
who are like excellent work.

667
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:37,400
Yeah,

668
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:37,761
it's bad.

669
00:19:37,761 --> 00:19:38,660
It's about men's layer.

670
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:43,490
How much time between her putting the
Saran wrap over your butt hole and you

671
00:19:43,491 --> 00:19:44,211
shooting a load,

672
00:19:44,211 --> 00:19:45,130
how much time fit?

673
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,000
15 seconds to put the Saran wrap,

674
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:48,530
five seconds to shoot.

675
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:49,701
Gosh,

676
00:19:49,701 --> 00:19:50,000
you know what I mean?

677
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,300
It's,

678
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:50,931
it's horrendous.

679
00:19:50,931 --> 00:19:53,300
I mean you call it feminism
Marxists with pennies.

680
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:54,760
Does that socialism,

681
00:19:54,761 --> 00:19:55,594
socialism,

682
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,970
socialism at test,

683
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,080
but that was a bad character
and one of my novels,

684
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,700
I just go on the feminism.

685
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:05,030
Socialism at Penn is that
is very true because I mean,

686
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,020
and then people call,

687
00:20:06,021 --> 00:20:06,531
oh my God,

688
00:20:06,531 --> 00:20:07,101
that's so terrible.

689
00:20:07,101 --> 00:20:07,390
That's not,

690
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:10,700
I just went through all the founding
matriarchs of the feminist system that all

691
00:20:10,701 --> 00:20:11,241
Marxists,

692
00:20:11,241 --> 00:20:16,241
all leftist and so on and also it feminist
is so pro woman then where are they

693
00:20:17,031 --> 00:20:17,990
with Margaret Thatcher?

694
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:21,230
Margaret Thatcher was like the
first leader of a Western country.

695
00:20:21,231 --> 00:20:22,730
She struggled that from nothing.

696
00:20:22,731 --> 00:20:24,350
I made an incredibly powerful woman,

697
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,430
but she was on the right.

698
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:25,761
You see,

699
00:20:25,761 --> 00:20:26,600
so they hate her.

700
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:27,710
What about Iran?

701
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:28,221
I ran,

702
00:20:28,221 --> 00:20:28,521
wrote,

703
00:20:28,521 --> 00:20:32,690
wrote the most influential book
outside the Bible and the second most

704
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:36,980
influential book and according to The
New York Times review of books after the

705
00:20:36,981 --> 00:20:37,640
Bible,

706
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:37,851
uh,

707
00:20:37,851 --> 00:20:38,091
you know,

708
00:20:38,091 --> 00:20:42,200
we shaped a western philosophy in
many ways and western politics and the

709
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:42,860
feminist hater.

710
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:43,071
Why?

711
00:20:43,071 --> 00:20:44,470
Cause she was on the right cause he's,

712
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,171
that's what they think.

713
00:20:45,171 --> 00:20:46,340
She was not actually on the right,

714
00:20:46,341 --> 00:20:50,370
but so I mean I have these sorts of
suspicions when they're sort of the,

715
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:53,110
is it the leftist
ideology or the pro woman?

716
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:54,400
Now if it's the pro woman,

717
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:56,140
then they should be incredibly positive.

718
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:00,430
Where are the feminists when people
insult people like Ann Coulter,

719
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,331
where are the feminist?

720
00:21:01,331 --> 00:21:02,740
When people insult Sarah Pailin,

721
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,240
you don't like Bill Maher,

722
00:21:04,241 --> 00:21:05,140
her called her a cunt.

723
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,660
I mean that's really pretty vicious.

724
00:21:07,661 --> 00:21:08,411
Like publicly,

725
00:21:08,411 --> 00:21:08,861
openly,

726
00:21:08,861 --> 00:21:09,131
right?

727
00:21:09,131 --> 00:21:12,630
I mean where are the fee because they
are on the rise and culture and they're

728
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,540
considered to be on the right.

729
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:15,430
So they get a pass when people go,

730
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:15,731
you know,

731
00:21:15,731 --> 00:21:18,040
but you then say something
bad about a woman on the left.

732
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:21,970
And so I think that he is more left
than it is pro women because when they

733
00:21:21,971 --> 00:21:24,220
choose between their
politics and the agenda,

734
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,620
they always seem to choose the
politics of what the agenda is.

735
00:21:26,621 --> 00:21:28,980
And that's why I say it's left
as rather than then problem.

736
00:21:28,981 --> 00:21:29,300
Right.

737
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,280
People always take things at face value.

738
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,100
They don't tend to get to know you or,

739
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:35,570
I mean I'm sitting right
in front of you now.

740
00:21:35,571 --> 00:21:38,060
Would you say that I am a woman?

741
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:40,043
No,

742
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:40,500
no.

743
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,240
Don't say you're a woman.

744
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:41,530
Thank you.

745
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:42,363
Have a beard.

746
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,493
Beard.

747
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:47,860
Yeah.

748
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:48,190
No,

749
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:49,330
you're basically a man.

750
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:49,751
Thank you.

751
00:21:49,751 --> 00:21:50,261
I appreciate it.

752
00:21:50,261 --> 00:21:50,770
No problem.

753
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:51,620
Be Compliment from

754
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:54,280
people.

755
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,720
Steal everything you see this is,

756
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:55,940
yeah,

757
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,110
this is awesome.

758
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:57,341
Yeah,

759
00:21:57,341 --> 00:21:58,174
I saw that.

760
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:00,160
You see that on fucking unbelievable.

761
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:01,330
Joey's in a far right.

762
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:03,370
That's insane.

763
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,530
That would look at when we were so cute.

764
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,390
I got the sexy lucky seven.

765
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:08,321
Can you get it?

766
00:22:08,321 --> 00:22:12,250
So it just as whole body feels is chrome
was 44 I was 44 there was local lucky

767
00:22:12,251 --> 00:22:13,230
seven cause I like that.

768
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,113
Look at that.

769
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:15,453
Wow,

770
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,473
that's so crazy.

771
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:18,490
Wow.

772
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:19,570
Look at you dude.

773
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:21,160
So how old are you in this picture?

774
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:22,750
14.

775
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,760
14 and that's what I was noticing.

776
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:25,840
I was smoking dope then.

777
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,300
I was no innocent then I was smoking dope.

778
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:29,701
I was finger bang.

779
00:22:29,701 --> 00:22:30,534
And people,

780
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,690
the hardest thing in the world is to say,

781
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:34,500
if somebody says to you,

782
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,333
relax,

783
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:36,660
right,

784
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:37,980
or be yourself,

785
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:38,970
it just be yourself,

786
00:22:38,971 --> 00:22:39,380
Joe.

787
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:40,100
You know?

788
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:40,770
I mean,

789
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:41,190
and,

790
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:46,190
and yet I think as we
become more professional and
better at what we're doing,

791
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:47,640
when somebody says to you,

792
00:22:47,641 --> 00:22:48,570
be yourself,

793
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,493
you can,

794
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:50,640
you can,

795
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,150
you know,

796
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:55,440
you're not burdened by these false
selves and these things that,

797
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:56,100
uh,

798
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,630
that you think you ought to
be or ought block to say,

799
00:22:58,631 --> 00:23:00,540
or how you want to look
or what you ought to be.

800
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:05,310
And I think in many ways that's what
any artist does as they become a

801
00:23:05,311 --> 00:23:06,420
professional at what they do.

802
00:23:06,421 --> 00:23:08,430
They learned to kind of
get out of their own way.

803
00:23:08,431 --> 00:23:09,660
And it's the hardest thing of all,

804
00:23:09,661 --> 00:23:10,330
I think.

805
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:14,080
Do you feel a responsibility for
that or towards that as an artist?

806
00:23:14,081 --> 00:23:16,170
Do you ever feel like because of the,

807
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,170
what you're doing,

808
00:23:17,171 --> 00:23:17,711
because if you're,

809
00:23:17,711 --> 00:23:18,820
you're so motivated,

810
00:23:18,821 --> 00:23:21,350
you get so much done and you have
so many different projects going.

811
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,331
Do you,

812
00:23:22,331 --> 00:23:24,310
do you realize the impact of that?

813
00:23:24,311 --> 00:23:26,920
Because a lot of people
were inspired by though the,

814
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:28,630
not just the work ethic that you have,

815
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,730
but the,

816
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,540
how much quality shit you produce,

817
00:23:31,541 --> 00:23:33,310
whether it's wine or music or,

818
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:34,330
I appreciate the company.

819
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,553
Um,

820
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:36,691
I think,

821
00:23:36,691 --> 00:23:38,370
I think you can't really worry about it.

822
00:23:38,371 --> 00:23:40,430
You just got to do what it is doing.

823
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,470
And for me,

824
00:23:42,471 --> 00:23:43,490
I just have to do what I'm doing.

825
00:23:43,491 --> 00:23:43,970
And there's a,

826
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:44,420
there's a,

827
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,253
there's a sense of,

828
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:47,420
for the art or for the,

829
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:48,171
the process.

830
00:23:48,171 --> 00:23:49,310
And just for myself,

831
00:23:49,311 --> 00:23:50,000
I just,

832
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,560
I care about what I'm doing.

833
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:52,490
Um,

834
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:54,850
if I start caring about what
you think about what I'm doing,

835
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,970
whether it's going to be helping you,

836
00:23:55,971 --> 00:23:56,331
then I'm,

837
00:23:56,331 --> 00:23:56,660
uh,

838
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,261
that I'm,

839
00:23:57,261 --> 00:23:57,500
uh,

840
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,580
an assisted living,

841
00:23:58,790 --> 00:23:59,450
uh,

842
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:02,480
employee when I was on the
space station the second time.

843
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:03,980
One of the other crew members,

844
00:24:03,981 --> 00:24:04,970
her name is sue Holmes.

845
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:05,810
Uh,

846
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:06,590
she and I were talking,

847
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:08,300
we'd known each other
since test pilot school.

848
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:10,460
And in passing a throwaway thing,

849
00:24:10,461 --> 00:24:11,480
she didn't even think she was saying.

850
00:24:11,481 --> 00:24:11,990
She said,

851
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:12,171
hey,

852
00:24:12,171 --> 00:24:12,381
you know,

853
00:24:12,381 --> 00:24:14,180
Earth said that we're
supposed to do this next.

854
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:15,321
And in my mind,

855
00:24:15,321 --> 00:24:16,940
I heard Earth said,

856
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,130
I heard those words come out of her mouth.

857
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,120
And it was like,

858
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:25,180
she has in her mind completely a split
off from the other 7 billion people.

859
00:24:26,151 --> 00:24:30,980
There's her crew and earth is one
singular identifiable entity on the other

860
00:24:30,981 --> 00:24:31,814
side.

861
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,260
And that was a real,

862
00:24:33,261 --> 00:24:35,980
a bellringer to me of what it's
going to be like to go to Mars.

863
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:37,580
Those people are going to be,

864
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:38,240
uh,

865
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,130
a completely discrete unit of
people and there'll be Martians.

866
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:44,150
They won't be earthlinks
pretty quick in their heads.

867
00:24:44,151 --> 00:24:45,530
And how do you deal with that?

868
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,000
How do we plan for that?

869
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:49,040
And it's still a long ways in the future,

870
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:51,800
but it's one of the many things
we need to sort out before we,

871
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,753
because as you say,

872
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,220
once you get the engines
going fast enough that you're,

873
00:24:55,221 --> 00:24:56,120
you're headed for Mars,

874
00:24:56,121 --> 00:24:57,170
you can't just turn around.

875
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,510
I think we're not talking an attorney.

876
00:24:58,511 --> 00:24:58,890
Right?

877
00:24:58,890 --> 00:24:59,131
Yeah.

878
00:24:59,131 --> 00:25:02,760
And in Houston I was an attorney then
in Dallas I started a computer company.

879
00:25:02,761 --> 00:25:04,790
I had a personal computer company that uh,

880
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:07,020
well in 1981 we outgrowth Microsoft,

881
00:25:07,021 --> 00:25:07,201
you know,

882
00:25:07,201 --> 00:25:10,080
I had four color picture
in Forbes magazine,

883
00:25:10,081 --> 00:25:13,800
made the front page of the Wall Street
Journal and really then IBM came in and

884
00:25:13,801 --> 00:25:15,060
crushed us like a bug.

885
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:16,823
Wow.

886
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:21,120
We just sort of sold ourselves out of
business and by the time we were done the

887
00:25:21,121 --> 00:25:21,980
last six,

888
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:22,531
eight,

889
00:25:22,531 --> 00:25:23,100
nine months,

890
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,860
I was financing the
thing by selling ecstasy.

891
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:27,130
What's,

892
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:27,891
and I know a guy,

893
00:25:27,891 --> 00:25:31,400
my acting class and you know how
long I was an acting class years.

894
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:32,060
There was a guy,

895
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:32,893
really good guy,

896
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:33,860
normal guy.

897
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,533
So I thought,

898
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,373
and he was,

899
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:41,120
and I hired him to shoot
me to shoot this audition.

900
00:25:41,121 --> 00:25:44,870
So I go to his house and he's got this
great camera and on his wall is a dream

901
00:25:44,871 --> 00:25:48,710
board and on his wall is his,

902
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:49,340
no,

903
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:49,540
no,

904
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:49,621
no,

905
00:25:49,621 --> 00:25:49,940
no.

906
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,500
He's put his face.

907
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:56,980
He's put his face on the cover of
vanity fair and those magazines,

908
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:00,320
he's got slogan's saying,

909
00:26:00,321 --> 00:26:01,220
you're the guy,

910
00:26:01,221 --> 00:26:03,620
you're the one and it's a dream board.

911
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,241
And it was big.

912
00:26:05,241 --> 00:26:05,541
It was good.

913
00:26:05,541 --> 00:26:06,620
Covered his whole wall,

914
00:26:06,621 --> 00:26:07,454
man.

915
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:08,360
Yes,

916
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,290
you should dream big,

917
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:12,620
but you should also be
realistic with who you are.

918
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:13,483
I won't do it.

919
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:14,470
He's gonna do it.

920
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:15,303
Shit.

921
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,900
He could put his hand between
my legs and roll me back.

922
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:21,760
Right.

923
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,910
But see that way you'll get,

924
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:27,230
don't let him see you doing that.

925
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,083
He's going to hurt you.

926
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,710
What does this 10% you keep saying,

927
00:26:30,711 --> 00:26:31,970
why do you keep saying 10%?

928
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:33,403
Well,

929
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,240
Brian keeps saying 10%.

930
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,580
It's a running joke based in truth.

931
00:26:37,581 --> 00:26:38,630
I had some issues.

932
00:26:38,631 --> 00:26:40,820
I had some situations in my life and I,

933
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,160
I like to put numbers on things and based

934
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:48,270
on these factors and experiences
and thought processes,

935
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:50,040
we came to the number of,

936
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:50,241
uh,

937
00:26:50,241 --> 00:26:51,074
uh,

938
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:54,030
10% gay.

939
00:26:54,031 --> 00:26:54,990
I'm open with it.

940
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,070
You know it it,

941
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,160
it's not,

942
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,500
what'd she just say it?

943
00:26:58,710 --> 00:26:59,543
It's not,

944
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:00,810
I understand what you just said.

945
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:04,200
What you just said was a statement that
would really work if everybody knew what

946
00:27:04,201 --> 00:27:05,034
you were saying,

947
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,060
but I don't know what you're saying.

948
00:27:06,061 --> 00:27:07,980
So what you're saying is a 10% gay.

949
00:27:07,981 --> 00:27:08,581
I'm open with it.

950
00:27:08,581 --> 00:27:09,414
What does that mean?

951
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,100
Does that mean you're 10% gay?

952
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,293
Yes.

953
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:16,530
I came out on my podcast
probably like six months ago.

954
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:18,450
You came out 10% yes.

955
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,473
So funny.

956
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,111
Is there any beers in there?

957
00:27:27,111 --> 00:27:27,740
Jamie?

958
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:28,573
Go get me a beer.

959
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,710
I need a beer on this one.

960
00:27:30,711 --> 00:27:30,801
Yeah,

961
00:27:30,801 --> 00:27:31,630
this is going to get rid of,

962
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:32,120
you know,

963
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,020
this is insane.

964
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:38,170
I just want to point something out of how
we are so weird like as a culture that

965
00:27:38,361 --> 00:27:41,660
this is a part of like
normal everyday office life.

966
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:43,340
Like we've got to make
some decisions here.

967
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,080
Like okay look at this woman.

968
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:48,020
She's showing everything but her vagina,

969
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:53,230
I mean her knee is just strategically
blocking her Lavia her legs are wide open

970
00:27:54,021 --> 00:27:55,670
and she's hot as fuck.

971
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:56,241
Now here's the thing.

972
00:27:56,241 --> 00:27:59,540
If you put the Kyron right
in front of the vagina,

973
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,100
then everybody would know the news.

974
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,113
Exactly.

975
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:05,870
We'd be a very informed country and women
would get angry at you if you knew the

976
00:28:05,871 --> 00:28:06,320
news.

977
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:06,501
Oh,

978
00:28:06,501 --> 00:28:08,780
you were looking at her vagina
and you read the fucking news.

979
00:28:08,781 --> 00:28:09,614
Huh?

980
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:12,210
This is like something that
I liked that Ron doss has,

981
00:28:12,211 --> 00:28:13,890
which is like if you don't
feel like meditating,

982
00:28:13,891 --> 00:28:14,724
don't meditate.

983
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:15,781
Don't force it.

984
00:28:15,781 --> 00:28:17,220
Don't impose this on yourself.

985
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,910
Keep doing the thing you're doing
that's upsetting you so much.

986
00:28:20,911 --> 00:28:23,790
Have the balls to keep doing the
fucking thing that you're doing.

987
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:25,170
Keep doing it.

988
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:26,760
If society is going to tell you,

989
00:28:26,761 --> 00:28:27,720
don't be like this.

990
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,890
Stop being like this.

991
00:28:28,891 --> 00:28:29,790
You'd have to change.

992
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:31,350
That's what your parents always say.

993
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:33,000
The idea is like no,

994
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:36,570
sink into what you are right now.

995
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:38,160
Just be that thing.

996
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:43,310
Stop resisting exactly where
you are right now is perfect.

997
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,050
And that's a hard truth to grasp.

998
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,460
I've been listening to a Dan
Carlin and barbecue my ass.

999
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:52,100
Dan Carlin was uh,

1000
00:28:52,101 --> 00:28:52,934
the um,

1001
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:53,600
uh,

1002
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:53,860
the,

1003
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:54,310
our,

1004
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:57,590
our guests on Monday and he has a
podcast called hardcore history.

1005
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:57,860
Yeah.

1006
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:59,990
And right now it's all about the Mongols.

1007
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:01,520
And for the next hour home,

1008
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:03,950
I listened to the history
of the Mongol Empire,

1009
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:04,580
uh,

1010
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:05,750
which is fascinating.

1011
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:07,550
Dan Carlin's hardcore history.

1012
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:07,771
Um,

1013
00:29:07,771 --> 00:29:08,660
I'm really into this,

1014
00:29:08,661 --> 00:29:10,040
I'm Dan Carlin,

1015
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,390
a podcast recently.

1016
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:14,760
He's got this podcast called
hardcore history and uh,

1017
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:19,370
he does this really detailed history
of the Mongols over like five,

1018
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,390
five episodes.

1019
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:20,541
Well,

1020
00:29:20,541 --> 00:29:22,730
I told you I'm a fucking
in love with that.

1021
00:29:22,731 --> 00:29:24,740
Dan Carlin's hardcore history podcast.

1022
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,041
You know,

1023
00:29:25,041 --> 00:29:26,870
that's one of the really cool things.

1024
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:28,850
This Dan Carlin thing on,

1025
00:29:28,851 --> 00:29:29,260
um,

1026
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:29,720
uh,

1027
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,950
on the history of the Mongols.

1028
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:31,340
You know,

1029
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:34,040
we had Dan Carlin on
from hardcore history.

1030
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,270
You're listening to that podcast.

1031
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:39,560
I have heard about it from one of his
most bad ass podcasts is about the

1032
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:40,190
Mongols.

1033
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:42,350
Kingus Khan was a mother fucker.

1034
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,500
Like he definitely killed 10 million.

1035
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:46,090
God Damn,

1036
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:46,751
that's unbelievable.

1037
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:47,200
That's,

1038
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:52,200
that's the best talking about armies
that were coming towards China where the

1039
00:29:52,241 --> 00:29:54,520
Mongols had been in the distance.

1040
00:29:54,521 --> 00:29:56,860
They thought they saw
snow covered mountains,

1041
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:00,790
but when they got close they
realized they were mounds of bones.

1042
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:01,810
Oh my God.

1043
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:04,270
And garlic and the
garlic is just gangster,

1044
00:30:04,271 --> 00:30:05,410
just killing everybody.

1045
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,120
Anybody that's anywhere,

1046
00:30:07,121 --> 00:30:08,770
it's like the Mongol hoards.

1047
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,680
It's like something out of
ancient times that we have that,

1048
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:12,240
you know,

1049
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:12,580
Jeff,

1050
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,660
it's like a Mongo whore.

1051
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:14,520
Right,

1052
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,353
exactly.

1053
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:16,570
That's pretty preposterous.

1054
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:20,690
The world has actually never been
less violent than it is today.

1055
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:21,541
Look at Syria,

1056
00:30:21,541 --> 00:30:24,310
how 100,000 people like,

1057
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:25,151
and it's a lot,

1058
00:30:25,151 --> 00:30:27,160
but I guess she used to be worried.

1059
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:29,600
I mean the Mongols killed
a million and a half,

1060
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,280
right?

1061
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,780
There's a lot less murder.

1062
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:35,200
Then there was like in the fucking 12
hundreds back during the Mongol days and

1063
00:30:35,201 --> 00:30:35,980
shit like that.

1064
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:36,541
Brian blog,

1065
00:30:36,541 --> 00:30:38,250
go to my Twitter and uh,

1066
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:42,460
there's a thing that I retweeted
earlier today from Dan Carlin,

1067
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,630
a hardcore history guy.

1068
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:44,621
He,

1069
00:30:44,621 --> 00:30:44,920
uh,

1070
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:49,920
put up a trailer of a Gingiss Khan and
the Mongols from like the John Wayne era.

1071
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,690
They did a movie with John
[inaudible] is con the Concord.

1072
00:30:55,691 --> 00:30:56,470
Everybody,

1073
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:59,260
the Mongols came through
Moscow in the winter.

1074
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,311
They came through the,

1075
00:31:00,311 --> 00:31:04,030
through the fucking attacked Russia in
the winter because nobody else would do

1076
00:31:04,031 --> 00:31:04,451
it that way.

1077
00:31:04,451 --> 00:31:05,110
And they didn't eat.

1078
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:06,040
They didn't see it coming.

1079
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,330
Did I tell you how they,

1080
00:31:07,331 --> 00:31:09,280
why they were so hard to
follow into the desert?

1081
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,140
Who the mom calls.

1082
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:12,160
You didn't have to tell me.

1083
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,031
I know a lot about them,

1084
00:31:13,031 --> 00:31:14,020
but go ahead if you want to.

1085
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:14,711
Well it's just what,

1086
00:31:14,711 --> 00:31:15,820
are you a fucking educator now?

1087
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:16,930
Because did I tell you,

1088
00:31:16,931 --> 00:31:17,381
cause they were like,

1089
00:31:17,381 --> 00:31:19,570
if we get some Saturdays
to get their arms together,

1090
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:20,241
I don't have,

1091
00:31:20,241 --> 00:31:23,090
I have I briefed you on the model.

1092
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,330
It's my friend.

1093
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:26,020
I'm going to do,

1094
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:26,980
I'm glad you asked.

1095
00:31:26,981 --> 00:31:28,720
I think we talked last
time about how there was,

1096
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:29,640
there was,

1097
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,900
there's pictures of,

1098
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,170
uh,

1099
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:32,140
of Afghanistan with,

1100
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:35,740
with Western ideal type
Western idea type cultures.

1101
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:36,550
Uh,

1102
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:36,761
you know,

1103
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:39,100
there was a massive
culture shift in terms of,

1104
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:40,090
you know,

1105
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:43,610
women with education and
your state of dress and,

1106
00:31:43,611 --> 00:31:45,100
and things wouldn't be allowed.

1107
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:45,911
Well,

1108
00:31:45,911 --> 00:31:50,500
there was a fantastic episode of hardcore
history and the Dan Carlin podcast

1109
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:53,230
where he talked about the
Mongols invading Iraq.

1110
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:53,411
Well,

1111
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,870
this is the second time that
someone has done that to Baghdad.

1112
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:56,650
It's a,

1113
00:31:56,650 --> 00:32:00,400
I've been listening to for
the past couple of years.

1114
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:02,260
Dan Carlin's hardcore history.

1115
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:06,730
When Baghdad was raided by the
Mongols and they crushed the society,

1116
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:11,410
they basically started from scratch
after that kills everyone and through all

1117
00:32:11,411 --> 00:32:14,020
the literature away so
that they save it today,

1118
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:19,440
they're just getting to the point like
culturally of where they were in 2012 and

1119
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:23,080
the Mongols were throwing trees at them.

1120
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:28,090
They cut all their trees down and then
they stacked them up with giant catapult

1121
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:30,370
and hurled them over the gates.

1122
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:34,210
Just Shroyer everything in the city and
what they would do is take the survivors

1123
00:32:34,211 --> 00:32:36,430
and put them in the
front lines and use them.

1124
00:32:36,431 --> 00:32:38,310
Oftentimes as the front.

1125
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:42,350
They would push an army into the town
and people would be shooting arrows at

1126
00:32:42,351 --> 00:32:43,370
their own friends.

1127
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:46,790
Thousands and thousands of people
just be forced through the door of a,

1128
00:32:46,791 --> 00:32:47,290
of,

1129
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:47,571
of a,

1130
00:32:47,571 --> 00:32:48,680
of the gate of a,

1131
00:32:48,681 --> 00:32:49,820
of a city.

1132
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:56,130
I listened to your Mongo podcast at least
four or five times what I called the

1133
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:01,090
Joe Rogan stopped telling Joe Rogan to
talk about your mom goal podcast on his

1134
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:01,993
shoe.

1135
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:06,790
You talked to this poor comedic woman
about it and you said something and there

1136
00:33:06,791 --> 00:33:07,240
was,

1137
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:07,901
we went back to her.

1138
00:33:07,901 --> 00:33:11,650
There's this long dead silence where she
tried to absorb what you just told her.

1139
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,250
Who was that?

1140
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:14,290
Who Do you think that would
have been a female comedian?

1141
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:15,880
She said I've got a show on consumer.

1142
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:17,110
Yeah,

1143
00:33:17,111 --> 00:33:18,340
that's most likely about it.

1144
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:20,530
There's this long pause like
what do I say after that?

1145
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:22,040
Yeah I can,

1146
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,500
Amy Schumer was some fucking crazy

1147
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:26,363
man.

1148
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,160
I must be broadcasting to record.

1149
00:33:28,161 --> 00:33:29,570
What the fuck I am broadcasting.

1150
00:33:29,571 --> 00:33:30,404
He cuts.

1151
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,430
There we go now.

1152
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:34,040
Now we're on ladies and gentlemen,

1153
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,140
we're sort of on time.

1154
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:38,380
Ah

1155
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:40,390
We try to get it right every week,

1156
00:33:40,391 --> 00:33:43,750
but every week we fucked something up
and this week I made sure that I turned

1157
00:33:43,751 --> 00:33:45,040
off the sound on my computer.

1158
00:33:45,041 --> 00:33:45,874
The one over there,

1159
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:47,460
I haven't even turned off
the sound on this one yet.

1160
00:33:47,461 --> 00:33:48,330
So for you,

1161
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:49,383
he did four years.

1162
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:50,280
You got mine do mine.

1163
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,790
He didn't do yours pass the torch.

1164
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,020
It could've easily been me.

1165
00:33:53,021 --> 00:33:53,741
That just fucked up.

1166
00:33:53,741 --> 00:33:54,190
Which is,

1167
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:55,570
that's the reason why I fucked up.

1168
00:33:55,571 --> 00:33:58,540
It's cause cause I'm here
cause I always fuck it up.

1169
00:33:58,541 --> 00:34:01,720
I fucked it up every week we'd done this
God damn thing like 22 weeks in a row.

1170
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:05,830
I fuck it up every single
time for this week.

1171
00:34:05,831 --> 00:34:06,640
It was Brian,

1172
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,121
you know,

1173
00:34:07,121 --> 00:34:07,510
uh,

1174
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:09,370
I've been thinking about
this podcast a lot,

1175
00:34:09,371 --> 00:34:11,410
ladies and gentlemen and a,

1176
00:34:11,411 --> 00:34:13,690
one of the things I've been thinking
about it is I appreciate the fuck out of

1177
00:34:13,691 --> 00:34:14,524
everybody listening.

1178
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:15,603
And uh,

1179
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:16,061
we,

1180
00:34:16,061 --> 00:34:20,260
we do try our best to make this as
interesting as possible and as smooth and

1181
00:34:20,261 --> 00:34:21,250
professional as possible.

1182
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:23,920
But I got admit that I've been
too stressed out about this.

1183
00:34:23,921 --> 00:34:25,270
I've been taking it too seriously.

1184
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:26,080
I mean,

1185
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:26,500
uh,

1186
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:29,620
taking seriously in a good way
where as we improve the sound,

1187
00:34:29,621 --> 00:34:31,020
we've got a real mixer and we got to,

1188
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:34,540
I mean we're sitting on couches and
shit and we're going to get it better

1189
00:34:34,541 --> 00:34:35,290
cameras,

1190
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:36,760
but that like,

1191
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:38,610
it's not like there's a part of it,

1192
00:34:38,611 --> 00:34:39,251
it's really fun,

1193
00:34:39,251 --> 00:34:41,890
but there's a part of it that wasn't
fun and I don't think that should exist.

1194
00:34:41,891 --> 00:34:44,350
I don't think I should ever
get too serious about this.

1195
00:34:44,351 --> 00:34:47,170
This is for people who are working,

1196
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:50,620
who are being distracted that just
wants something because they're doing

1197
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:51,340
mindless shit.

1198
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:54,430
This is for people that are
driving in their cars and you know,

1199
00:34:54,431 --> 00:34:57,130
wants up to now listen to this
is for people on the train.

1200
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,330
This is for people at the gym,

1201
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,650
whatever the fuck it's for you guys.

1202
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:00,400
All right.

1203
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,390
And if,

1204
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:02,860
if we take it too seriously,

1205
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:04,630
you stop being yourself and it starts,

1206
00:35:04,631 --> 00:35:08,260
starts being like this professional
thing that you're trying real hard to do.

1207
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:09,250
And uh,

1208
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:09,701
I think,

1209
00:35:09,701 --> 00:35:09,970
uh,

1210
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:11,980
I think I've fallen prey
to that a little bit.

1211
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:15,670
I was thinking about it today after to
took a little bit of the head of the weed

1212
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,560
and I was thinking
about it and I was like,

1213
00:35:17,561 --> 00:35:18,220
you know what man,

1214
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:18,970
this thing,

1215
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:19,700
like I'm,

1216
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,130
I'm like,

1217
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:20,320
Aye.

1218
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:20,560
Aye.

1219
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:25,560
I paid too much attention to it and she'd
just be a weekly fun thing like it or

1220
00:35:26,051 --> 00:35:26,680
not,

1221
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,131
you know,

1222
00:35:27,131 --> 00:35:27,610
for,

1223
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:30,970
for anybody who's a likeminded or
anybody is interested in some sort of a

1224
00:35:30,971 --> 00:35:32,870
distraction from someone
who's not likeminded.

1225
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:33,730
Um,

1226
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:35,170
so thank you very much for tuning in.

1227
00:35:35,171 --> 00:35:35,740
Everybody.
