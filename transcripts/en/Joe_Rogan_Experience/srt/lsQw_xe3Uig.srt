26
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,220
innocent Canadian boy who hadn't
really gotten out much Joe.

27
00:00:35,221 --> 00:00:35,761
And how it,

28
00:00:35,761 --> 00:00:36,750
when we say experiment,

29
00:00:36,751 --> 00:00:41,751
we're talking about with Mike [inaudible]
and similar to the bosses or more,

30
00:00:41,911 --> 00:00:43,380
have you ever taken a Percocet?

31
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,070
I'm like,

32
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:44,903

34
00:00:45,651 --> 00:00:47,040
have you ever taken a Percocet?

35
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:49,040
So I of course look at it up a painkiller.

36
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:49,400
Well,

37
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,700
how would I want to know
when I'm not hundred friends?

38
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:52,230
Come on,

39
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:52,961
you've got to try it.

40
00:00:52,961 --> 00:00:53,041
He,

41
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:53,520
I said,

42
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:53,701
oh,

43
00:00:53,701 --> 00:00:54,061

44
00:00:54,061 --> 00:00:54,894
well why not?

45
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:55,800
So he gives me,

46
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,870
you gave me three percosets do not one,

47
00:00:57,871 --> 00:00:58,350

48
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,880
So I take these things,

49
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:00,391
okay,

50
00:01:00,391 --> 00:01:00,781
fine.

51
00:01:00,781 --> 00:01:03,600
Just whatever Coleman and
Randleman walk in and,

52
00:01:03,601 --> 00:01:04,260
uh,

53
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:04,951

54
00:01:04,951 --> 00:01:05,191

55
00:01:05,191 --> 00:01:05,371

00:01:06,511 --> 00:01:06,721
An Egg.

59
00:01:06,721 --> 00:01:07,800
You don't mean I'm very impatient.

60
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:07,981
I'm like,

61
00:01:07,981 --> 00:01:08,071
well,

62
00:01:08,071 --> 00:01:09,030

63
00:01:09,031 --> 00:01:09,864

64
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:10,370

65
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:10,830

70
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,960
And then all of a sudden almost on cue it,

71
00:01:18,961 --> 00:01:20,670
it hits me and I end up,

72
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:21,061

82
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,390
And I'm really just kind of needling him.

83
00:01:36,391 --> 00:01:36,780
And he,

84
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:37,350

85
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:37,771

88
00:01:38,881 --> 00:01:39,241
He knows,

89
00:01:39,241 --> 00:01:39,451

92
00:01:41,341 --> 00:01:41,910

93
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:43,530
But I am pushing it because I'm,

94
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:45,600
I'm impacted by percosets bite.

95
00:01:45,601 --> 00:01:45,991
But do you,

96
00:01:45,991 --> 00:01:48,270
are you thinking that
you're doing a performance?

97
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:48,940
No,

98
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:49,230
that's,

99
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:49,801
that's the thing.

100
00:01:49,801 --> 00:01:51,300
I felt like I was,

101
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:51,931
I was hot.

102
00:01:51,931 --> 00:01:52,411
I was,

103
00:01:52,411 --> 00:01:52,961
I was like,

104
00:01:52,961 --> 00:01:53,240
Daddy,

105
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,480
your hand was out of my mind.

106
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,260
Thought you were going to,

107
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,960
wanted to beat up and saying,

108
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,680
I don't think I could beat him up.

109
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,401
Beat him up,

110
00:02:02,401 --> 00:02:02,641
Joe.

111
00:02:02,641 --> 00:02:03,930
But I challenged him to fight.

112
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:06,370
He finally had enough home face.

113
00:02:06,371 --> 00:02:09,630
Paul me broke my glasses and I
got a bloody nose and I'm like,

114
00:02:09,631 --> 00:02:11,100
well now I've got to
wear the badge of honor.

115
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,020
And I took the picture with him and a,

116
00:02:13,021 --> 00:02:13,750
an incident.

117
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,101
I'm like,

118
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:14,640
yeah,

119
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,320
I don't think I'll be
doing percosets anymore.

120
00:02:16,321 --> 00:02:18,840
I'll stick to a that the chassis ever.

121
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,040
Yes.

122
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:20,610
Thank you.

123
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:21,091
Yes.

124
00:02:21,091 --> 00:02:21,924

Percocet is a good guy.

126
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,710
He has a really good guy,

127
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:28,733
Mario.

128
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,180
When he hit the ground he said,

129
00:02:30,181 --> 00:02:30,481
okay,

130
00:02:30,481 --> 00:02:31,314
this is over.

131
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:32,640
We're not going to,

132
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,660
do you remember when was anymore?

133
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,890

134
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:35,370
Yes.

135
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:35,911
And He,

136
00:02:35,911 --> 00:02:36,300
uh,

137
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:41,300
he was one of the first guys I ever saw
through a really hard kicks to the legs

138
00:02:41,521 --> 00:02:42,354
from his guard.

139
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,130
And I remember watching that going,

140
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,270
oh look at this.

141
00:02:45,271 --> 00:02:47,610
Cause he would prop himself
up and it's bad Karma,

142
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,290
whipped that leg into it.

143
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,760
And he had Randy with some,

144
00:02:50,761 --> 00:02:52,490
a hard kicks back,

145
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,060

146
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:54,301

like a colored extinguished cognitive had

177
00:03:43,351 --> 00:03:44,590
come and he's screaming.

178
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:45,310
Yeah,

179
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:49,680
everything falls out of the freaking
retardant and fire retarded.

180
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,281
He released it,

181
00:03:51,281 --> 00:03:52,290
he released it.

182
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,200
And you have to show it
on anyway to show you.

183
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:59,050
I know he's just walking and suddenly he
separates himself from the group and he

184
00:03:59,051 --> 00:03:59,500
hits them.

185
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,790
And you don't want to fight that night.

186
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,141
That night,

187
00:04:03,141 --> 00:04:04,300
that the first time when he said,

188
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:09,330
well the [inaudible] was the first time
five members of the Gracie family had

189
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,220
ever competed on the same
card over Daniel by marriage.

190
00:04:12,221 --> 00:04:12,411
Right.

191
00:04:12,411 --> 00:04:17,411
So you had a yet Hanzo and Carlos would
at Hanzo highend Ho Dorrigo Daniel.

192
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:19,960
And who was the other one?

193
00:04:19,961 --> 00:04:21,220
I'm missing disrespect,

194
00:04:21,221 --> 00:04:23,060
but the Daniel thing is a weird one.

195
00:04:23,061 --> 00:04:23,590
Yeah.

196
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:26,010
Is that your last name or
is it your wife's last name?

197
00:04:26,011 --> 00:04:26,844
Yeah.

198
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:28,960
What in the fuck is going on here,

199
00:04:28,961 --> 00:04:29,770
sir?

200
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,060
And went to a boxing gym.

201
00:04:31,061 --> 00:04:34,300
Went that if I just could
use the boxing during,

202
00:04:34,301 --> 00:04:34,571
you know,

203
00:04:34,571 --> 00:04:35,404
to train.

204
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:37,160
And the guy comes to me and he says,

205
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:37,600
if you want,

206
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,100
I can teach you some groundwork.

207
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:39,451
She's,

208
00:04:39,451 --> 00:04:39,640
you know,

209
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,473
I'm a great sheet.

210
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:41,231
I see your gray.

211
00:04:41,231 --> 00:04:41,411
She,

212
00:04:41,411 --> 00:04:41,591
yeah.

213
00:04:41,591 --> 00:04:41,830
What?

214
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,780
It got married to a Gracie.

215
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:45,630
Oh,

216
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:48,603
how strange.

217
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,180
Uh,

218
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:50,790
but it,

219
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,740
but that night high and took
the mic after and went off.

220
00:04:53,741 --> 00:04:54,161
I mean,

221
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:56,740
using every expletive I'm known demand,

222
00:04:56,741 --> 00:04:58,740
just snapped it because of the issue.

223
00:04:58,810 --> 00:04:59,800
Go Yoshito hoists,

224
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:01,690
Gracie controversy and well,

225
00:05:01,691 --> 00:05:03,640
high end was the craziest of all,

226
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:05,250
but you know what?

227
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,550
We had some good times with him.

228
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:07,000
Oh,

229
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,060
real good times.

230
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,690
What I e a like you say a tortured soul,

231
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,360
but at the toss anyway,

232
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:13,720
always a good one of the few,

233
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:14,231
not few,

234
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:14,741
a lot of guys,

235
00:05:14,741 --> 00:05:16,960
but he always went out
of his way to make me,

236
00:05:16,961 --> 00:05:17,171
I mean,

237
00:05:17,171 --> 00:05:17,741
you're a legend,

238
00:05:17,741 --> 00:05:18,574
but to make the,

239
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:18,961
you know,

240
00:05:18,961 --> 00:05:20,650
the main thing announced her feel good.

241
00:05:20,651 --> 00:05:21,484
He always came up.

242
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:21,791
Laura,

243
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:21,971
hello.

244
00:05:21,971 --> 00:05:22,631
Good to see you.

245
00:05:22,631 --> 00:05:22,931
And well,

246
00:05:22,931 --> 00:05:24,110
once you test

247
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,101
altercation,

248
00:05:30,101 --> 00:05:30,901
we had old,

249
00:05:30,901 --> 00:05:31,600
uh,

250
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,320
the bounces,

251
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,430
telus Randleman also.

252
00:05:33,431 --> 00:05:37,810
And he did body the very first New Year's
Eve we spent in Japan for shockwave.

253
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,090
It was you,

254
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:39,520
uh,

255
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,690
Kevin Randleman highend Gracie.

256
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,970
Quentin went to the left to
give because he knew he is

257
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,680
sense of,

258
00:05:49,681 --> 00:05:50,514
Oh man,

259
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:52,920
mad.

260
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,171
Hey,

261
00:05:53,171 --> 00:05:54,600
you guys take him to the knife though.

262
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,710
The one that made the
most sense was this guy.

263
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,030
You were the one that kept
the peace because Kevin was,

264
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,050
was losing his mind.

265
00:06:00,051 --> 00:06:01,550
And even high end Gracie kept saying,

266
00:06:01,551 --> 00:06:01,851
moral,

267
00:06:01,851 --> 00:06:02,421
don't worry,

268
00:06:02,421 --> 00:06:03,081
we'll be okay.

269
00:06:03,081 --> 00:06:03,441
And I'm like,

270
00:06:03,441 --> 00:06:03,621
why?

271
00:06:03,621 --> 00:06:04,100
He goes,

272
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:04,761
just trust me.

273
00:06:04,761 --> 00:06:05,450
We're okay.

274
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:06,201
And I swear to God,

275
00:06:06,201 --> 00:06:07,310
I thought he might've had a gun,

276
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,800
but what are you buddy
buddy buddy saying like,

277
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:09,643
well that's going on.

278
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,100
You would it be okay about,

279
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:11,391
okay.

280
00:06:11,391 --> 00:06:15,190
So he bought some weed from
some of my bounces there and,

281
00:06:15,191 --> 00:06:15,550
and,

282
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:16,310
and I didn't look,

283
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:16,611
because,

284
00:06:16,611 --> 00:06:16,881
you know,

285
00:06:16,881 --> 00:06:17,111
it's,

286
00:06:17,111 --> 00:06:17,321
it's,

287
00:06:17,321 --> 00:06:18,170
it's a felony there.

288
00:06:18,171 --> 00:06:20,870
So I just get it and we walk
off and while we would walk off,

289
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,820
we realized that I pick it out.

290
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:23,180
I said,

291
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:23,571
oh,

292
00:06:23,571 --> 00:06:24,650
that is not enough.

293
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,240
So I go back and I say,

294
00:06:26,241 --> 00:06:26,540
guys,

295
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,111
that's not enough.

296
00:06:27,111 --> 00:06:27,771
You need to give me more.

297
00:06:27,771 --> 00:06:28,101
And he goes,

298
00:06:28,101 --> 00:06:28,221
no,

299
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,000
that's not going happen.

300
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,320
And he has this attitude.

301
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:30,661
I say,

302
00:06:30,661 --> 00:06:30,921
okay,

303
00:06:30,921 --> 00:06:31,940
well let me do it different.

304
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:33,650
I'm going to be back in 10 minutes.

305
00:06:33,651 --> 00:06:34,970
We are going to be back in 10 minutes.

306
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:35,811
And then,

307
00:06:35,811 --> 00:06:36,180
uh,

308
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:36,370
at,

309
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:37,203
that'd be here.

310
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,570
So we walk around and we thought,

311
00:06:38,571 --> 00:06:39,080
you know,

312
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,130
maybe we should light it up.

313
00:06:40,131 --> 00:06:43,070
At least we relax and we're in this weird,

314
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,390
what is it though?

315
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,460
There's meal boxes.

316
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:45,891
Like it's,

317
00:06:45,891 --> 00:06:46,724
it's a

318
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:49,843
complex.

319
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:54,910
And suddenly randomly start jumping up
and she started getting angry and he hit

320
00:06:55,411 --> 00:06:58,760
a mailbox and then Ryan starts
and I'll try to keep these boats,

321
00:06:58,761 --> 00:06:59,421
these guys down.

322
00:06:59,421 --> 00:06:59,691
And I go,

323
00:06:59,691 --> 00:06:59,811
no,

324
00:06:59,811 --> 00:06:59,891
no,

325
00:06:59,891 --> 00:07:00,020
no,

326
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:00,580
like you guys,

327
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,190
you actually,

328
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:01,940
I just got to shut up.

329
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:02,361
My friend.

330
00:07:02,361 --> 00:07:03,160
I say to write.

331
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:03,993
And I go,

332
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:04,510
Oh,

333
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:05,490
don't do me like this was,

334
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:05,720
hey,

335
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,411
come on man.

336
00:07:06,411 --> 00:07:07,700
Are you really doing this right now?

337
00:07:07,701 --> 00:07:09,500
When we get this whole fight goes on?

338
00:07:09,501 --> 00:07:09,711
I said,

339
00:07:09,711 --> 00:07:09,771
no,

340
00:07:09,771 --> 00:07:09,841
no,

341
00:07:09,841 --> 00:07:09,951
no.

342
00:07:09,951 --> 00:07:10,630
We've got to elect,

343
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,260
stay with extra smoke a little weed.

344
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:13,400
We're going to go back.

345
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:15,230
Finally everybody calmed down.

346
00:07:15,231 --> 00:07:18,260
We go back and these guys
probably call somebody,

347
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:19,061
but oh no,

348
00:07:19,061 --> 00:07:19,220
no.

349
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:19,940
First of all,

350
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:20,181
these,

351
00:07:20,181 --> 00:07:21,030
we'll quickly the guys,

352
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,390
two big guys and I walk over and say,

353
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:23,541
oh,

354
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:23,841
so,

355
00:07:23,841 --> 00:07:24,530
um,

356
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:24,790
we,

357
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:25,611
we need to right now.

358
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:26,001
And they say,

359
00:07:26,001 --> 00:07:26,151
oh,

360
00:07:26,151 --> 00:07:26,841
we need to wait to,

361
00:07:26,841 --> 00:07:28,280
because they're bringing it right now.

362
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:31,970
So right away already we are looking
back and sure enough there's two big guys

363
00:07:31,971 --> 00:07:32,211
coming.

364
00:07:32,211 --> 00:07:36,800
Also same clothes as they have and you
see them very sturdy walking up to us and

365
00:07:36,801 --> 00:07:41,660
as soon as they see us they make a
one 80 and it talked back into phone,

366
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:42,920
goes from the guy and I go,

367
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:46,010
those are the guys calling you right
now telling you you got to give it up.

368
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:46,843
And he goes,

369
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,230
he opens the phone and into the guy,

370
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:49,221
he says okay.

371
00:07:49,221 --> 00:07:51,140
And he puts it down and he
gave us a whole mountain

372
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,391
right over a movie.

373
00:07:56,391 --> 00:07:56,631
Man.

374
00:07:56,631 --> 00:07:57,260
It was hilarious.

375
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,360
But the whole altercation when everything,

376
00:07:59,361 --> 00:08:00,350
everybody start jumping.

377
00:08:00,351 --> 00:08:01,400
That's what Quinten left.

378
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,263
Yes.

379
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,093
This

380
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,390
various,

381
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,330
you have a great times.

382
00:08:08,331 --> 00:08:09,110
Great Times.

383
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:09,321
Yeah.

384
00:08:09,321 --> 00:08:10,250
Crazy Times.

385
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,593
There's a good time.

386
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,130
Yup.

387
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:12,550
How,

388
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:16,940
how much of a presence was the whole
Yakuza thing while you guys were there?

389
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:17,501
Like how,

390
00:08:17,501 --> 00:08:20,950
how aware of you guys have
it where you guys know,

391
00:08:20,951 --> 00:08:22,120
I know I was it,

392
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:22,730
but no one,

393
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:25,280
nobody would notice the occlusive.

394
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:26,360
His name is Hans and drugs.

395
00:08:26,361 --> 00:08:27,380
They don't do anything like that.

396
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:30,500
But real estate to show you
saw people sitting down,

397
00:08:30,501 --> 00:08:31,860
they'd okay you well,

398
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,220
people with like they were missing fingers

399
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:36,973
went

400
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:39,050
crazy.

401
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:40,820
That was where Masato the week boxer was.

402
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,260
Mickey Rourke was,

403
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:46,400
they're all 60 and we ran
this a strip club and uh,

404
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:50,900
this guy sits there and I'm with long
hair and he comes over to me and says,

405
00:08:50,901 --> 00:08:51,201
hey,

406
00:08:51,201 --> 00:08:51,860
how you doing?

407
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,120
Like a little feminine.

408
00:08:53,121 --> 00:08:53,954
That really weird.

409
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:56,970
You've got to be the biggest
fan of biggest failures or
we've got this crazy guy

410
00:08:56,971 --> 00:08:57,151
here,

411
00:08:57,151 --> 00:08:57,361
right?

412
00:08:57,361 --> 00:08:59,220
And I had no clue what to think.

413
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,300
And um,

414
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:00,870
he said,

415
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:01,021
oh,

416
00:09:01,021 --> 00:09:01,621
you're a great fighter.

417
00:09:01,621 --> 00:09:02,401
You want to know what I do?

418
00:09:02,401 --> 00:09:05,280
And he takes his shirt off and he's all
tatted up and people start literally

419
00:09:05,281 --> 00:09:06,330
leaving the place there.

420
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:06,930
And again,

421
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:08,240
I realize he's Jaga right?

422
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,090
So we started talking,

423
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:13,410
I was talking about it and then a
tattooed that I wanted them this color.

424
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:13,981
I said,

425
00:09:13,981 --> 00:09:15,180
but in America it's hard to find.

426
00:09:15,181 --> 00:09:17,220
At the time people only
wanted to use black ink.

427
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,001
And he says,

428
00:09:18,001 --> 00:09:18,151
no,

429
00:09:18,151 --> 00:09:18,901
that's not hard at all.

430
00:09:18,901 --> 00:09:20,070
Why don't you come tomorrow morning?

431
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:20,731
And,

432
00:09:20,731 --> 00:09:21,060
uh,

433
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,350
W I can do this for you.

434
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,540
So the next day he and I,

435
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:27,840
we go to this dodgy like five
stories under the ground.

436
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,673
Right.

437
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:30,300
It was the weirdest place.

438
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,670
We opened the door.

439
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:34,760
There is a cage would
have back that Masako

440
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:40,800
indicates with two dobermans
do fly up against the thing.

441
00:09:40,801 --> 00:09:43,380
It's like just human skulls everywhere.

442
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,450
This pictures of books killing people.

443
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:45,780
Yeah.

444
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:46,613
This guy,

445
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:47,100
man,

446
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,980
he starts screaming and older people who
are getting to two at at that moment,

447
00:09:49,981 --> 00:09:52,320
they all get up and they
run out to the displays.

448
00:09:52,321 --> 00:09:53,900
They locked the door and I look at Mars,

449
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:54,650
I'm like,

450
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:55,483
Ooh,

451
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,790
you know,

452
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,770
because this is a really weird situation.

453
00:09:58,771 --> 00:09:59,604
But no,

454
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:02,131
he was,

455
00:10:02,131 --> 00:10:02,941
he did a great work,

456
00:10:02,941 --> 00:10:03,151
you know,

457
00:10:03,151 --> 00:10:03,870
but it was,

458
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:04,580
he started looking,

459
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,510
we made it big chairs.

460
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:08,100
I was taking pictures
of taking video of you.

461
00:10:08,101 --> 00:10:08,380
I'm going to,

462
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:11,340
because I have a call with
a bullet hole in there.

463
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,890
I was going to actually
record an audio will as well.

464
00:10:13,891 --> 00:10:14,280
Uh,

465
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,490
because there was a cage
where Masato used the term.

466
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:18,270
That's what I saw.

467
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:18,910
The kickbox.

468
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:19,060
Yeah,

469
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:19,310
yeah,

470
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:19,610
yeah.

471
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:20,443
I said,

472
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:21,830
yeah,

473
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,730
he would train in a cage in a basement.

474
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:24,480
Well,

475
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,940
five stories below me.

476
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,060
We kept going down.

477
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:28,020
It was the craziest thing.

478
00:10:28,021 --> 00:10:29,820
If you think about all
the earthquakes they have.

479
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:30,420
Yeah.

480
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:30,631
You know,

481
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:33,930
you go like [inaudible]
with the Dobermans in there.

482
00:10:33,931 --> 00:10:34,231
Yeah.

483
00:10:34,231 --> 00:10:35,041
I don't know who this is.

484
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:36,120
Regular Trading Joe,

485
00:10:36,121 --> 00:10:37,020
but that's a,

486
00:10:37,021 --> 00:10:39,360
that's what the guy
said that it was Masato.

487
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:49,120
Okay.
