1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,830
Oh, I won't. That means we're on. So I'm,

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:10,110
I'm multitasking Greg Proops that's
what kind of podcast or I am.

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,490
I love that monkey noise though.

4
00:00:11,491 --> 00:00:14,640
Cause that to me alerts me to
many things are happening at once.

5
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,910
The jungle is full of activity.
That's how you got to look at it.

6
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:19,350
You really have to look at it that way.

7
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,610
It's like you got to make a positive out
of it. Always. The natives are restless,

8
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:26,580
you know, we think it's cute. But in
reality if you heard that fucking noise,

9
00:00:26,581 --> 00:00:27,480
he'd be terrified.

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,020
If you're out there in the jungle and
you hear it might be some mother fucker

11
00:00:31,021 --> 00:00:34,230
ready to jump on you bite your
dick or it's me. That's creepy.

12
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:38,700
Right before you buy it is creepy. If it
was just you in the woods, I'd be like,

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,000
oh, what's up dude? Yeah,
that'd be the end of it. If
it was a monkey in the woods,

14
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:45,690
man, he'd be fighting for your
fucking life. Monkeys are terrifying.

15
00:00:45,691 --> 00:00:49,290
And I was in Barbados once and
they have green monkeys. Yes.

16
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:52,440
To call it green monkey. Ja,
they threw shit. You know,

17
00:00:52,441 --> 00:00:55,320
my wife and I were like walking through
the parking lot of the hotel and all of

18
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:58,650
a sudden a giant branch falls
next to us and I'm like, really?

19
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,390
And you look up and they're
like, yeah, fuck you.

20
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,030
I know you don't care how much
you, they're kind of Douchey. Yeah.

21
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:09,120
They killed a guy in India recently,
a mayor of a town. It was a,

22
00:01:09,121 --> 00:01:11,760
I don't know what happened, but he got
swarmed by monkeys and they killed him.

23
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:16,620
Like that can happen. And in Gibraltar,
the apes are attacking people to Christ.

24
00:01:16,621 --> 00:01:20,700
Greg Proops. You know, it's like
that movie James Franco was riot man.

25
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,130
James Franco's always right.
Well the gym,

26
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,940
so I could be wrong about just James
Franco was always right. Uh, you could,

27
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,570
how about you fucking make James
Franco's are always right.com. Thank.

28
00:01:33,571 --> 00:01:37,130
Go to squarespace.com make your own
website for it. Set up an online store.

29
00:01:37,131 --> 00:01:40,110
Started selling. James Franco
was always right. Tee shirts.

30
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,960
It's no disrespect to James Franco.
This is not parody.

31
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:46,170
This is just saying that this is not a
parody. We're not being assholes here.

32
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:51,270
We like you. I just, you know that
fucking movie man, while he was right,

33
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:55,590
the apes are taking over. I watched
the staying on, uh, uh, I don't know.

34
00:01:55,591 --> 00:01:58,650
I think it was PBS where they,
they was showing baboons and Africa.

35
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:00,630
People were just simply tried
to go to the supermarket,

36
00:02:00,631 --> 00:02:05,310
but baboons new now gotten hip to the
jive that there was food to be had at the

37
00:02:05,311 --> 00:02:09,690
parking lot and they were just rolling
people for their bags of groceries,

38
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:12,720
kicking their ass and take a minute to
think scarier than about them because

39
00:02:12,721 --> 00:02:16,140
they're like a tiger mixed with a
monkey or whatever. Horrible teeth.

40
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:17,101
They'll jump on you.

41
00:02:17,101 --> 00:02:22,000
They fight in packs and they organized
their like highly intelligent dogs.

42
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:26,910
Like they get up on too and like,
it's just mortifying.

43
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:30,690
You're watching like a lady
with two grocery bags and
about the and just fucking,

44
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,560
and you're like, I would, I
would never stop screaming.

45
00:02:34,561 --> 00:02:37,590
And that's what it feels like to go
to John's instead of Vaughn's. Yeah.

46
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:42,710
Been there. [inaudible] they don't
have, we can't afford an age remorse.

47
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:46,680
Like, oh, they have no problem
killing you mean anything to them?

48
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:49,920
Like our idea of like what's
fair and what's not fair,

49
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:53,940
what we expect and don't expect. It's
thrown out the window with wild animals,

50
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,400
especially wild animals
that get too used to people.

51
00:02:56,401 --> 00:02:59,770
That's why they have a real problem
with like bears that live in and start

52
00:02:59,771 --> 00:03:03,490
tacking the garbage. Then they, that
becomes a source of food. Like period.

53
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:07,750
They don't ever quit and then they run
into people and all kinds of crazy shit

54
00:03:07,751 --> 00:03:09,220
can happen,
especially if they have kids.

55
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,150
It's not that Boone morality that him to
just informs everything in nature that

56
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:17,410
I protest most vehemently. Very
smart to God. Three Smart Fox.

57
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:21,260
How about the meatball? The bear was
it who was going into houses? Uh,

58
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,540
and like he found me. Paul's in the
freezer. They're like our key in me.

59
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:28,390
Paulson was just like eating
them and sitting in the hot
tub and shit. Holy Shit.

60
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:28,601
No.

61
00:03:28,601 --> 00:03:31,390
People come home and find bears on their
couch watching TV and stuff with their

62
00:03:31,391 --> 00:03:35,990
weed. You know, like there's really, it's
like you say though, they, they don't,

63
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:39,070
it's a pattern to them. You know
what I mean? They know Tuesday,

64
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:40,990
Tuesday night there's going to be pizzas.

65
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,270
I'm coming down and I'm
meeting them or not.

66
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,120
It doesn't even matter if it's Tuesday,
it's,

67
00:03:45,121 --> 00:03:47,710
they're going to keep checking your
house over and over and over again.

68
00:03:47,711 --> 00:03:50,860
If they find out that there was garbage
there, once it becomes a source of food,

69
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,530
right.
And they have to shoot him,

70
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:57,550
it gets real or they have to take on and
bring them to zoos. Squares my soccer.

71
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:03,160
Worse commercial ever, but
yet the best, uh, anyway,

72
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,310
that's squarespace.com is an
awesome place to build a website.

73
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:10,390
Really is very bad ass, easy
design. Ah, you could try it
out. If you don't like it,

74
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,430
you just tell them to go fuck themselves.

75
00:04:12,431 --> 00:04:13,930
You don't even have to give
your credit card information.

76
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,960
Once you decide you like it, you say, Hey,

77
00:04:16,961 --> 00:04:19,390
I can make a bad ass
fucking website on my own.

78
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:24,050
Then you enter in your credit
card information. It's super
easy to do. You can, um,

79
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,390
have it set up so that
it goes live as a store.

80
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:33,550
You can make your own store like super
easy. You can make websites super easy.

81
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:36,490
It's, it used to be like a very
difficult task to make a website,

82
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,000
but it's not anymore.
Uh,

83
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:42,880
so go to squarespace.com
and check that shit out.

84
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:46,190
Actually turned my mom onto it because
she wanted to make a website for her

85
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,190
flower company on this side. Like
she just, you know, she's retired,

86
00:04:49,191 --> 00:04:49,941
but she has like the,
you know,

87
00:04:49,941 --> 00:04:53,330
once in a while she'll do this flower
arrangement thing and I told her to go

88
00:04:53,331 --> 00:04:56,420
here and she's actually making one
and it seems pretty easy for her.

89
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:57,350
So that's crazy.

90
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,210
Yeah. Oh, go ahead and please,

91
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:02,510
I was going to ask the name of your
mother's flower company and flat bolt. Oh,

92
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:03,130
nice.

93
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:04,420
So Mary and me,

94
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,520
my mom and my ex fiance's mom and
they have a flower company together.

95
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:14,390
Wow. They're going to get, they're
going to get offers now. I know

96
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,550
people want to go judge squad squad roses.
What town do they live in?

97
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,700
Tell Him Jesus Christ. Columbus, Ohio,

98
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:28,020
a murder throwing your mother did in
Columbus, Ohio, every couple of weeks.

99
00:05:28,021 --> 00:05:33,021
But only two women who run a small
florist shop can solve this crime.

100
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:39,120
Someone climbed over this Rose Bush.
This rose was firstly snapped.

101
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,930
I told my trainer to use
squarespace.com keeps saying like,

102
00:05:42,931 --> 00:05:45,500
I need her website or need to get
a website built. I'm like, bitch,

That's an easy thing to say to people
that would say they need a website.

105
00:05:49,651 --> 00:05:51,440
Like just do it. You can do it
yourself is super easy. Yeah.

113
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:22,610
Apparently Hulu is pretty fucking bad
ass. I've heard about it for years. Um,

114
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:25,090
people, uh, you know, watch
different shows on it.

115
00:06:25,091 --> 00:06:28,710
I never exactly knew what it did though,
until uh,

116
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:32,510
I started paying attention recently and
lets you watch thousands of hit shows

Yeah, I have it on my Xbox. Do
you use it? Uh, you know, I, I,

119
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:41,570
I've had it for a while and it's one of
the things I always forget that I have

120
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:45,170
and because it's not that expensive. So
like when you pay for it, you're like,

121
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:47,990
it's one of those, Oh, I forgot
I, I subscribed to this. Oh,

122
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:50,720
I should watch it sometime. But
when I do, I usually just watch.

123
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,110
I should let a family guys,
when I just want to sit there and watch a,

124
00:06:53,111 --> 00:06:55,500
I have family. I'm really
stupid. I just like, you know,

125
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,590
South Park family guy and
a couple other things.

126
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:01,020
When you get Outta here, you don't
want no thinking. Yeah. I don't know.

127
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:04,050
I don't understand that.
You're not watching the four,

128
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:07,410
the three tenors or whatever it is,
or Celtic woman ever.

129
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:12,270
Sarah Brightman what are those things?
Those are all the PBSC DVDs they offer.

130
00:07:12,271 --> 00:07:14,050
When you flipped by,
you know,

131
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:17,730
the PBS channels where people go to the
Cerritos Arts Center to see a thing,

132
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:20,910
right. It's always the, it's
always a classical music.

133
00:07:20,911 --> 00:07:24,030
There's some group with four good looking
dudes and they're called Il something.

134
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:27,180
Someone will write you, I'm
sure if you, uh, and then, uh,

135
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,860
the Celtic woman has like five hot looking
Irish girls who wear long dresses and

136
00:07:31,861 --> 00:07:34,620
they go, Yep, Yep. And
you know, single Celtic.

137
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:39,360
And then there's Sarah Brightman who was
Andrew Lloyd Webber's a wife years ago.

138
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:42,840
Does this like mystical, which
deal? But in theaters, you know,

139
00:07:42,841 --> 00:07:46,800
so like it's for regular people, it's
not for witches. Wow. And you know,

140
00:07:46,801 --> 00:07:49,680
she hung the moon comes
up and shit and I'm like,

141
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:53,160
Sarah Brightman after midnight
or whatever. And it's like,

142
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,380
she was a musical comedy star basically.

143
00:07:55,381 --> 00:08:00,150
He found the shtick doing like kind of
Demi Golf music for people who don't

144
00:08:00,151 --> 00:08:03,450
really like classical. You know what
I mean? It's like you're not smooth.

145
00:08:03,451 --> 00:08:05,640
Jazz is for people who
don't actually liked jazz,

146
00:08:05,641 --> 00:08:08,700
they just want something in the
background and it's got a saxophone in it.

147
00:08:08,701 --> 00:08:12,390
Then went to sedate them. You
know, like they don't want to fuck,

148
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,141
they don't want jazz.

149
00:08:13,141 --> 00:08:15,030
They didn't wanna listen to Charlie
Parker who still have a heart attack.

150
00:08:15,031 --> 00:08:20,031
The smooth jazz can push you to accelerate
into traffic as new jobs every day.

151
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:24,150
It will suck the zest out of life.
Yeah.

152
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:29,040
When you hear him smooth jazz version
of like a Michael Jackson Song from 1978

153
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:33,420
[inaudible] you'll be like, this isn't
making it happen as much as it might.

154
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,090
How often do people get to
listen to music at work?

155
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:39,680
I think if they let you have the radio on,
uh,

156
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,220
it's probably one of those commercial,

157
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:45,990
a crappy stations or top 40 shit where
they can guarantee no one's going to say

158
00:08:45,991 --> 00:08:48,690
something screwy. Or if everyone
agrees and everyone's the same age,

159
00:08:48,691 --> 00:08:51,320
I'm guessing like an oldies station
like k or if there's something to,

160
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,430
it was just going to be sunny
and share all day or whatever.

161
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:54,890
When I went back anyway,

162
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,030
they had a CD,
it

163
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:58,200
was like an hour long
and it just repeated.

164
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:04,400
I hate for like six months at a time would
get, oh we get a new CD and then they,

165
00:09:04,401 --> 00:09:06,180
we're like, oh, on this top,

166
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:10,290
something that lives inside me like an
Armadillo and is waiting to burst out the

167
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:15,300
music at the lax airport in every single
restaurant there are bar hard rock in

168
00:09:15,551 --> 00:09:18,190
the morning and stuff like
journey and shit. And I mean,

169
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:21,040
when I say hard rock on me and
like classic, you know, I mean,

170
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,520
can we take it down a notch?
And then Christmas carols start,

171
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:25,900
sometimes the Christmas was killed.

172
00:09:25,901 --> 00:09:29,350
Channel come on accidentally at lax and
just be on for a while and you're like,

173
00:09:29,351 --> 00:09:32,800
what the fuck? And they'll
go, it's on a computer or
whatever. And you're like, wow,

174
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:35,260
that's kind of unacceptable
since we're trapped,

175
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:38,710
it's kind of fucked up to
play something that's sucks.

176
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,920
Like if you walked in and
there's some thrash metal,

177
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,333
yeah,

178
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:49,430
I would be like, oh, come on
Dick. Right. This is a donut shop.

179
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:54,060
But if I went to a skateboard shop
and it was like 8:00 PM would accept,

180
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:56,360
we go to Abercrombie and Fitch and he,

181
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:59,080
we walk in there and it's so loud and
you just want to look at sweaters or

182
00:09:59,081 --> 00:10:03,550
something and it's like when they hit
you with that fucking stinky, the air,

183
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,810
what kind of weirdness

184
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:09,210
that where they,
they don't accept the way reality smells.

185
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:14,250
They must spray some chemicals in your
face that you know are not good for you

186
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:18,640
and pumps shitty music in your ears
that really, really gay thoughts.

187
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:24,930
It's fucking shaving down hairless
dude's all sleek and slim and I'm in love

188
00:10:26,171 --> 00:10:27,580
with this but on Hulu you can,

189
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:31,600
there's this show called Chicago fire
and I'm in love with this girl right here

190
00:10:31,601 --> 00:10:34,210
and she just started following me on
Twitter. Her name's Laura and German.

191
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:38,110
Laura German. That has nothing to
do. We're just talking about, yeah,

192
00:10:38,111 --> 00:10:42,840
Hulu because he didn't see her stalker
and a that shows on who? The CDC.

193
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,370
That's cool. If you want to
watch the show with her though,

194
00:10:45,371 --> 00:10:48,520
because you can go back a season and
you could watch the whole season,

195
00:10:48,521 --> 00:10:51,700
like the first season and there
is limited commercials on it,

196
00:10:51,701 --> 00:10:53,780
but I think it's only seven 99.
Yeah,

197
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,280
it's seven, seven, nine nine a month.

198
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:59,820
You could stream as many TV shows and
movies you want whenever you want. Um,

199
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:03,260
it's great way to, to access.
Also, they have new content too.

200
00:11:03,261 --> 00:11:07,190
They have Hulu originals, originals,
Hulu originals are doing now.

201
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:12,550
The awesome starring Snl Seth Meyers and
a moon boy starring Chris O'Dowd from

202
00:11:15,771 --> 00:11:16,700
bridesmaids.

203
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,030
So they're starting to do their own
content just like sorta like Netflix is

204
00:11:20,031 --> 00:11:24,230
doing, which is pretty bad ass. I
love that people are doing that.

205
00:11:24,231 --> 00:11:27,380
I love seeing this new progression.
You know,

206
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:32,280
I haven't watched that Netflix show with
Kevin Spacey, House of Wizard, his carts.

207
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,840
I heard it's fucking incredible. Yeah,
I keep hearing it's fucking incredible.

208
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,840
There was an English version. It was
really good. Now he's a bad motherfucker.

209
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:45,170
Anyway. Um, Hulu plus
go there, check it out.

210
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,820
Laura German by all kinds of shit.
She thinks the world of you, man.

211
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:54,080
Go to Hulu plus.com forward. Slash.
Rogen. Yeah. She's in love with and to

212
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:57,400
anyways. This is a good show. If you
like fires like I don't watch much.

213
00:11:57,401 --> 00:12:00,540
You like fires. No Book of
matches. This show rules.

214
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,940
If you're inspired by the ancient
elements, it's, it's really cool.

215
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:08,800
I actually don't want to shows. I got
into this. It's good. It's like er,

216
00:12:08,801 --> 00:12:11,860
but in fact about fires. What's
it called again? A Chicago fire.

217
00:12:11,861 --> 00:12:14,990
Its second season right now. Just started.
It's Microstar. That's my buddy. Yeah,

218
00:12:14,991 --> 00:12:17,710
it's a big guy right there.
He was on a show called hardball with me,

219
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:21,820
sweetheart of a guy who was in
Goodfellows gets A's in a thousand movie.

220
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:22,510
The bodyguard.

221
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:25,580
He played the guy that Kevin
Costner gotten the craziest
fight and the bodyguard

222
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,040
and super, Super Nice Guy. One of the
nicest guys I've ever met and hold on,

223
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,420
I was sitting there. Yeah, that's the guy
from sticking to the city right there.

224
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:35,860
You know the one guy that [inaudible] how
would you know Josh? You have a penis.

225
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,940
What's wrong with that statement?
Miss Charlotte Guy.

226
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,550
I liked Charlotte too. Yeah. Anyway,

227
00:12:42,551 --> 00:12:47,510
go to Hulu Plus Hulu plus Ford.
Slash I mean that's,

Rogen.

232

disorganized commercial ever,

233
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:11,410
but I think we got a lot of solid
entertainment in there and that's what's

234
00:13:11,411 --> 00:13:14,020
really important.

again now everything's going on,

253
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:24,820
Eh, it's, it's a nice day today.
I'm excited to be out here.

254
00:14:24,821 --> 00:14:28,120
I don't get to woodland hills is,
can I say where we're broadcasting from?

255
00:14:28,121 --> 00:14:31,270
Is it an undisclosed location? Undisclosed
location. But you fucked that up,

256
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:32,104
so wow.

257
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:37,750
You get real specific Tarzana
area and uh, so, uh, yeah,

258
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:39,490
no, it's nice to be on
earth with you, man.

259
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,020
It's nice to be on earth with you as well.

260
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:45,100
All rotating around the smartest man in
the world podcast. That's the one that,

261
00:14:45,101 --> 00:14:48,130
that guy's name, the guy couldn't
get the name right. Yeah, no. Right.

262
00:14:48,131 --> 00:14:52,010
It's a hard one man in the room. It's
difficult to remember. Yeah. The smartest

263
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:53,810
guy in the room. Yeah.
That one. Cause there was,

264
00:14:53,811 --> 00:14:56,300
I think a documentary of that and Ron
that was called the smartest guys in the

265
00:14:56,301 --> 00:14:59,660
room. Yeah. Yeah. You don't want to be
connected to that creepy shit. Now I down,

266
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,210
I watched that documentary. That
wasn't it again. Very strange. Yeah.

267
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:06,770
It only makes sense though, you
know, I don't understand finances,

268
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:09,440
but the corruption of finances
only makes sense to me.

269
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:13,820
So a movie like Enron or it turns out
the bunch of dudes just fucking robbed

270
00:15:13,821 --> 00:15:15,140
everybody blind.
Yeah,

271
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,100
I guess that's what you rolling
brownouts they get crazy. Yeah.

272
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:24,080
They try to figure out more ways to make
money. But that's always the way it is.

273
00:15:24,081 --> 00:15:26,930
If you allow people to make
the insane amounts of money.

274
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:30,530
And I'm not saying you shouldn't,
I'm not, I'm not, you know,

275
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,770
I'm not necessarily a
socialistic in any way,

276
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,010
but if you allow people to get
to that billion, trillion, that,

277
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:43,010
that fucking insane amount
of influence level. Woo.

278
00:15:43,011 --> 00:15:47,180
That's slippery. That gets really
crazy. We'll look at the world. I mean,

279
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:50,510
that's what's going on right now. That's
why the government is closed and shit.

280
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:53,330
Exactly. It's why the government's
close. It's why there's war.

281
00:15:53,331 --> 00:15:57,110
It's all these big groups
because as individuals,

282
00:15:57,111 --> 00:15:59,420
because you imagine if
the world consisted,

283
00:15:59,421 --> 00:16:04,250
is only individuals where there was only
like a few people on the planet and you

284
00:16:04,251 --> 00:16:07,100
know, Russia was like, listen,

285
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:10,370
we're going to go into Afghanistan
and we're going to take your shit.

286
00:16:10,371 --> 00:16:13,430
And Afghanistan was like one guy and he's
like, what are you talking about man?

287
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:17,330
And Russia was like one guy, like, why
are you here? Like what are you doing man?

288
00:16:17,331 --> 00:16:19,410
You got your spot. I got my
spot. What the fuck's going on?

289
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:23,060
Because I want your spot too, man.
But because there's so many people,

290
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:27,170
then there becomes this weird diffusion
of responsibility where we can somehow

291
00:16:27,171 --> 00:16:31,730
or another, even in this day and age still
justify all the crazy shit that we do.

292
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:35,690
You mean like sending bombs around the
world by remote control all that? Yeah,

293
00:16:35,691 --> 00:16:40,670
absolutely. That's really
freaky. You know, there's,
there's some numbers you know,

294
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:44,360
that, uh, are very disputed about,
we were talking about on the podcast,

295
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:48,920
like some sources say that 98% of the
people that are killed are civilians and

296
00:16:48,921 --> 00:16:50,750
then other people are saying,
well,

297
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:54,290
the reality is that the census
is there are not that good.

298
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:57,950
It's not that easy to tell how many
people were killed. They'll exaggerate.

299
00:16:57,951 --> 00:17:01,210
There's a lot of lying going on.
There's a lot of, a lot of, um,

300
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:06,770
misinformation that comes back and forth
from both sides. But like either way,

301
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,680
even if it's not 98%, he, how about it?

302
00:17:09,681 --> 00:17:13,610
Let's make it 2% 2% innocent.
It's pretty fucked up.

303
00:17:13,611 --> 00:17:17,820
And the other 98%, what exactly
are they guilty of? You know,

304
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:22,730
what exactly are you doing where you
think it's okay to launch missiles through

305
00:17:22,731 --> 00:17:26,760
the air? It's like some shit that
we don't exactly know. You know, we,

306
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,880
we assume they're really,
really bad guys.

307
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:32,420
We have to take off this earth because
they're involved in terror plots. Okay.

308
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,750
I believe that, you know, it's
possible that that could be going on.

309
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,200
It could be going on, but
shit, that's a crazy way to go.

310
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,420
And if a bunch of people are
near you, tough shit. Yeah.

311
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:46,370
I think for them it's a more
economical way than sending an army.

312
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,070
And it also plays to all the defense
contractors because kind of shit they have

313
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:53,100
to use for that's most high tech
and most expensive. And it can,

314
00:17:53,101 --> 00:17:56,850
it's just like everything else in
life. It's like just how the, you know,

315
00:17:56,851 --> 00:17:58,200
the early days of Samurai,

316
00:17:58,201 --> 00:18:02,030
I didn't want to adopt the gun and
it was proved very costly. Like the,

317
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:06,840
we were always moving forward, especially
with weapons and these, it's inevitable.

318
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:10,380
Didn't you see Malala said to Obama
yesterday when you say that she said the

319
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:14,340
Predator drones are creating terrorism.
Yeah, I would imagine there were the,

320
00:18:14,341 --> 00:18:17,400
our terror, the terror from
the sky, absolute terror.

321
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:20,940
There's many definitions of terror
and won a state operated terror.

322
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,280
And that's what that is.
Yeah. And it's, there's this,

323
00:18:23,281 --> 00:18:27,840
that the idea that it's somehow or another
protecting us. I get that, you know,

324
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:30,630
I get that and I want to believe that.
I really do.

325
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,670
It's a huge violation of
the Geneva Convention.

326
00:18:32,671 --> 00:18:34,680
If anyone cares about the
Geneva convention anymore,

327
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:38,160
it says explicitly you mustn't
kill innocent children. Yeah.

328
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,100
They're not trying to, I guess, you know,

329
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:44,550
I don't know what the fuck is really
going on. Obviously I'm not there,

330
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:49,140
but the idea of it as just
a complete objective person,

331
00:18:49,141 --> 00:18:53,580
like looking at it from the outside,
it's so science fictiony it's so,

332
00:18:53,581 --> 00:18:55,440
or William.
It's so weird.

333
00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:00,000
It seems like something from a horror
movie like from like 20 years ago,

334
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:03,930
a horror movie about the future, but
it's just like the terminator, right?

335
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:07,940
I mean it's not happening here. Pinpoint,
but he could, shit, man, that's,

336
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:09,870
technology starts to evolve.

337
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:13,950
People are going to want revenge for
things that have been done to their

338
00:19:13,951 --> 00:19:16,110
communities and that's
where it gets fucking crazy.

339
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:21,060
They're actually talking about launching
blimps and to the air to protect from

340
00:19:21,061 --> 00:19:22,710
missile attacks.
Oh God.

341
00:19:22,711 --> 00:19:26,520
Like World War One when they'd put a
bunch of blimps up to fog the Yankees.

342
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:31,050
Christ. Yeah. Wow. You hear all
this crazy talk and you're like,

343
00:19:31,051 --> 00:19:34,590
Jesus Christ. How about everybody
just work this shit out?

344
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:39,150
Do people really want to take those kinds
of risks and kill that many people and

345
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:44,160
isn't it possible you guys can just settle
the fuck down and everybody just talk

346
00:19:44,161 --> 00:19:47,610
things through? Mm. Not Currently,

347
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:51,730
but it might happen one day.
Right. There's been, uh,

348
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:56,100
some years of peace in the last 500 years.
What about a couple of 25 30 years?

349
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:59,460
I don't know if there really has been,
have there ever in the world,

350
00:19:59,461 --> 00:20:00,630
not in the world.
I've mean,

351
00:20:00,631 --> 00:20:03,870
I've read statistics like
that and different magazines
where they'll say like in

352
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:06,810
the last 500 years there's
been cumulative 20 something.

353
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:09,570
I don't know how they pieced
together the years of peace within.

354
00:20:09,571 --> 00:20:14,571
That means one whole year in a row or
with a part of a year and two weeks here

355
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:16,614
and two weeks there.

356
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:20,490
It doesn't seem like there's been
peace ever since I've been alive. Yeah.

357
00:20:20,491 --> 00:20:23,580
I don't think there's ever been piece.
If you, you're thinking about worldwide.

358
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:25,380
I grew up with Vietnam. Yeah. I mean,

359
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,040
even if you just kind of America
because after Vietnam then, well, yeah,

360
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:30,980
worldwide it was V it never stops.
Well,

361
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:34,350
there's always been some creepy shit
going on. Even when we weren't at war.

362
00:20:34,351 --> 00:20:34,780
I mean,

363
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:39,510
and we learned about the Oliver North
trial and the Sandinistas in Nicaragua and

364
00:20:39,511 --> 00:20:42,870
all that shit back when Reagan was in
office and we didn't really know what was

365
00:20:42,871 --> 00:20:46,950
going on until that was coming out. Yeah,
and also there we were involved you,

366
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,480
we were involved

367
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,370
in all sorts of military shit.
Even when we weren't officially at war.

368
00:20:51,371 --> 00:20:55,390
Like though I'm getting pain and they
gotta get paid and they got to get paid

369
00:20:55,391 --> 00:20:58,630
off. That was a drug. Drugs
and money. Drugs too, for sure.

370
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:01,930
And most likely drugs right now.
And people don't want to admit that,

371
00:21:01,931 --> 00:21:05,650
but it is so obvious.
It's ridiculous.

372
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:09,490
They have poppy fields everywhere.

373
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,240
They increased the amount
of heroin they grow,

374
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:16,960
the u s invaded and increase that.
Yeah,

375
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:22,210
I mean I get it. I'm not saying you
shouldn't make money selling heroin.

376
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,180
Wasn't it the same thing in Vietnam
with the Golden Triangle though? Yes.

377
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:29,530
Basically it her one profit making
organism. No one wants to believe that.

378
00:21:29,531 --> 00:21:30,910
And that's a problem.

379
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:35,710
The problem is that a lot of people
are averse to disturbing information.

380
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,120
They don't want to believe it.

381
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:40,270
They don't want to believe that at
the highest levels of government.

382
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:42,610
Some of them must be selling some shit.

383
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:48,940
If you the government and you knew like
it's almost like a public safety thing

384
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:53,200
to have the government sell in the coke
and them being the big dealers rather

385
00:21:53,201 --> 00:21:56,080
than some crazy guy, at least
the government, you know,

386
00:21:56,081 --> 00:22:00,020
they probably have some fucking rules
as to how they're going to deal with a,

387
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:04,870
their competitors and how they're
going to handle things. I wonder,

388
00:22:04,871 --> 00:22:07,140
I mean it's,
well that brings me to the metal,

389
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:12,180
the medical marijuana question because
having just been in Canadia and and Jan

390
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,700
van and a Washington,
you know,

391
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:19,090
on the one hand I'm all for
them being able to sell pot,

392
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:23,240
but on the other hand you're getting
the government involved and that, oh,

393
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,000
it's a little frightening to me.

394
00:22:25,001 --> 00:22:27,640
Unless you can get the government
high and then get them involved,

395
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:31,480
then it would work out.
That really is the only hope.

396
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,490
I know that sounds so stupid,

397
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:38,530
but the only hope for this culture that
we have right now is that people get

398
00:22:38,531 --> 00:22:43,300
high and take another look and go,
wait a minute, what are we doing?

399
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:47,710
Get. I somehow get get high through
yoga if you don't want to smoke weed,

400
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:51,400
but if you do want to smoke weed,
the best thing to do is to smoke weed.

401
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:56,830
Don't fuck around. Dive right in and don't
be a bitch. Take a look at this thing.

402
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:00,640
This thing is crazy.
This is a crazy,

403
00:23:00,641 --> 00:23:05,641
crazy world that doesn't make any sense
to anybody and no one stops and goes,

404
00:23:05,861 --> 00:23:08,550
hold up.
Why do we keep doing it this way?

405
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:12,730
Why are we keep doing this?
Why are we keep doing the same shit?

406
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:16,160
It's been fucking up our ancestors.
Why? What do we deal with in detail?

407
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:19,750
I don't want to kill you. You don't need
to kill me. Let's talk this man shit out.

408
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:20,621
That's the thing.

409
00:23:20,621 --> 00:23:24,430
I've never had any anything against any
of the countries we've been at war with

410
00:23:24,431 --> 00:23:27,580
in my entire lifetime at
never thought to myself,

411
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:32,080
God dammit fucking Iraq.
What was, you know,

412
00:23:32,081 --> 00:23:34,510
it never really affected us personally.
No.

413
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:37,900
Except people who lost friends
and loved ones of course.

414
00:23:37,901 --> 00:23:41,260
And that will actually went over
there. But yeah, it was too easy.

415
00:23:41,261 --> 00:23:43,980
It's too easy starting these things.
I mean stunning them.

416
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:47,300
You know what's too easy
when you don't feel anything,

417
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:49,220
you know when you're over
here, we don't, it's,

418
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:54,260
it's a human being as used to accepting
the risks and rewards in its own

419
00:23:55,071 --> 00:23:59,060
environment. The other shit outside
your environment is just so fake.

420
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:03,590
It's so abstract. It's so hard to wrap
your head around the Great Wall of China.

421
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:04,890
There's people on the Great Wall of China,
right?

422
00:24:04,891 --> 00:24:08,150
And they're walking around and what,
what are you talking about?

423
00:24:08,151 --> 00:24:11,360
Like that's going on right now on the
other part of the world. It doesn't seem,

424
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:12,530
I don't feel that here.

425
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:16,670
So when bombs are dropping in Afghanistan
and Iraq war in Pakistan through

426
00:24:16,671 --> 00:24:19,460
drones,
it feels like nothing over here.

427
00:24:19,461 --> 00:24:21,890
It feels just like someone
walking the Great Wall of China.

428
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:25,790
If we're too detached, we don't,
we're not getting the impact.

429
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,850
If we were in the community,
would see the fear and talk to him.

430
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:31,560
They were terrified and talk to people,

431
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:36,260
lost loved ones because these bad guys
are camping out in the same town as you.

432
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:40,130
It's terrifying. Terrifying
Shit. I think we are,

433
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:43,700
we're just so far away from it.
We're getting the information,

434
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:47,420
but we're so far away. It
just doesn't seem real. Now.

435
00:24:47,421 --> 00:24:51,290
There's a huge disconnect and I think
in the public discourse and even bigger

436
00:24:51,291 --> 00:24:53,090
disconnect because of that,

437
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:56,180
I think people have it feelings and
people have emotions so people know what's

438
00:24:56,181 --> 00:24:59,910
going on. But I think that that,
that emotional disconnect as a,

439
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:04,910
as a huge Malays that's gotten worse,
I think in the last few years.

440
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,110
I think you're right.

441
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:11,110
I think the economic pressure on top of
it and the disconnection and the fact

442
00:25:11,541 --> 00:25:15,590
that it's become clear that the
really, really wealthy, you know,

443
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,420
it's going to be this way.

444
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:21,770
They're not really willing to budge
on it for the moment. And uh, yeah.

445
00:25:21,771 --> 00:25:23,480
And there's only one way to stop that.

446
00:25:23,481 --> 00:25:26,090
You have to put a cap on how
much money someone can have.

447
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:29,060
And that just doesn't seem right
either. Well, no, we can't do that.

448
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,130
That's like saying you have to
have all the guns back tomorrow.

449
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,830
That's not going to happen either.
Yeah, that's it. That's it.

450
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:36,850
That's even less possibly
out because you know,

451
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:40,610
I think it would be easier almost to put
a cap on how much money you can make as

452
00:25:40,611 --> 00:25:43,550
long as it was just a preposterous cap.
I'm not even,

453
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:45,530
I'm not even adverse
to people making money.

454
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:49,070
I would simply like them to pay their
fair share of the fucking, you know,

455
00:25:49,071 --> 00:25:52,790
rent on that raggedy
motherfucker that's so big to me.

456
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:55,250
I really wished that I
trusted where it all went,

457
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:58,850
but I think it's very
important to me to pay up.

458
00:25:58,851 --> 00:26:03,020
Like there was a time when I was a kid,
why didn't pay taxes for like shit,

459
00:26:03,021 --> 00:26:06,230
it was like a year or something like
that. Yeah. I didn't pay taxes for you.

460
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,640
I was just broke.
It was just too broke.

461
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:10,520
And then when I got some money then
I've got an account and paid all my back

462
00:26:10,521 --> 00:26:14,510
taxes. I just was, I was barely
getting by as a comedian.

463
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:19,700
But I felt like such a loser. I felt
like, like when I wasn't paying my taxes,

464
00:26:19,701 --> 00:26:23,330
I felt like a scrounge. I felt like
if you in the principle of taxes,

465
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:27,410
I'm not saying that they go to the right
use and I'm not saying that I agree

466
00:26:27,411 --> 00:26:30,560
with it, but with with its
decisions that our government makes.

467
00:26:30,561 --> 00:26:31,640
But I think that I've,

468
00:26:31,641 --> 00:26:34,970
I very much agree with the idea of
everyone contributing to the community.

469
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:38,240
And I think that if it
was managed really nicely,

470
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:43,010
if it was a really like healthy
police force filled with nice,

471
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:44,040
who are

472
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:47,580
just trying to help out. And the same
thing with governors, the governors,

473
00:26:47,581 --> 00:26:49,410
if they were really
healthy and nice people,

474
00:26:49,411 --> 00:26:52,530
we're just trying to really expand
the community and not be influenced by

475
00:26:52,531 --> 00:26:56,910
special interest groups that want them
to allow certain poisons to be stored in

476
00:26:56,911 --> 00:27:00,570
her holes in the ground and shit.
If they weren't influenced by that,

477
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,250
then I would feel even better about it.

478
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:06,510
I would really be happy about my
contribution to our community.

479
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:11,960
I think it's super important to pay taxes
on turning you down to that, you know?

480
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:15,660
No, I'm fine with, did you turn yourself
down? I think I did. I think it is too,

481
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:16,770
but I think it's like you said,

482
00:27:16,771 --> 00:27:20,070
there's just too much coopting going
on in the system. And uh, I mean,

483
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,530
well it's too big. The, the,

484
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:25,680
the problem I have is that the richest
people want to keep talking about John

485
00:27:25,681 --> 00:27:27,930
and government and stopping government
because governments evil cause

486
00:27:27,931 --> 00:27:30,150
governments this big boondoggle
that people are sponging off of,

487
00:27:30,151 --> 00:27:32,940
but they're the ones sponging off
of it and then they don't give any,

488
00:27:32,941 --> 00:27:36,510
they don't pay any taxes because they
avoid it and you think, well fuck you.

489
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:40,620
You're not giving in and
you're not helping out on
the other end and you want to

490
00:27:40,621 --> 00:27:45,180
take away poor people's allotments and
poor people aren't taking all the money

491
00:27:45,181 --> 00:27:49,290
away. Like if everybody that was a
giant corporation paid their taxes,

492
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,680
there'd be plenty of money
floating around. Yeah.

493
00:27:52,681 --> 00:27:56,010
But the problem is it's not
just how much money comes in.

494
00:27:56,430 --> 00:28:01,050
The real problem then becomes what happens
with that money. Who's handling this?

495
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:05,390
Who's, who's setting up organizations?
Yeah, honey. Exactly. I mean,

496
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:09,310
that's where our real problem gets what,
$600 billion a year or something.

497
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:13,550
Oh Shit. They just go, I'll
take that pitch. Yeah. They
get the right thing. Yeah.

498
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:17,580
They just backhand us and then us
getting across the floor on her ass,

499
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,700
try to start a little health care and
everybody has a fucking heart attack all

500
00:28:20,701 --> 00:28:25,320
up in this place. I am so ignorant
when it comes to this Obama care thing.

501
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:28,500
I tried to pay attention to it
and I tried to read up on it,

502
00:28:28,501 --> 00:28:33,380
but my add kicked in hard.
Yeah. It's perplexing. It's,

503
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:37,800
there's two issues. One, the one that's
really weird is that it's already a law.

504
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:42,330
Yes. Correct. Okay. So the
Supreme Court, so what the fuck,

505
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:46,600
what are these guys doing? Like how
can you like resist a law? Well,

506
00:28:46,601 --> 00:28:48,070
and that's not the way to resist a law.

507
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:52,410
That sounds like you think that
your ideas are more important. Well,

508
00:28:52,411 --> 00:28:57,210
let me give you a, uh, a bad analogy.
And the 1870s after the civil war,

509
00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:00,960
that was a big election between
Tilden and Hayes. And, uh,

510
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:05,150
it got thrown like the Gore Bush one,
right? It was a lot of chick cannery,

511
00:29:05,151 --> 00:29:09,210
a lot of jiggery pokery and a lot of vote
fucking rolling and dad people on the

512
00:29:09,211 --> 00:29:12,480
rolls and shit. And rather than
throw it to the Supreme Court,

513
00:29:12,481 --> 00:29:17,130
they put a three man panel together
who put it down in Hayes favor. Well,

514
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:20,010
children was more of a
reformer in Hayes wasn't.

515
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:23,970
And so Jim crow was allowed to
flourish after his administration.

516
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:28,200
Jim Crow was against the law of the land
because those laws had been put in the

517
00:29:28,201 --> 00:29:29,310
constitution.

518
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:34,590
Even black men got the right to vote that
they were no longer property when they

519
00:29:34,591 --> 00:29:38,940
were no longer slaves. All of those
things are laws. So it's like, well,

520
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,530
they did it anyway.

521
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:44,050
They made bathroom segregated and
restaurant segregated on the country

522
00:29:44,051 --> 00:29:47,050
segregated. And they just fucking
did it. And like right now,

523
00:29:47,051 --> 00:29:51,880
they don't want the affordable healthcare
act. They don't want whatever Obama,

524
00:29:51,881 --> 00:29:53,680
they're unhappy with
whatever the agenda is.

525
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:57,640
They're simply stopping
it because they can, uh,

526
00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:01,380
constituted not constitutionally that,
you know, organizationally within the,

527
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:06,370
the rules of order, they're
allowed to pull this shit. And uh,

528
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,540
I think it's the same thing.

529
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:12,570
There was no point it ruined the
country then that Jim crow got in.

530
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,470
Cause if they'd kept it
the way it was supposed to,

531
00:30:14,471 --> 00:30:19,471
there was lots of black congress people
after the civil war in the south and

532
00:30:19,511 --> 00:30:22,120
they were all republicans cause
that was the party of abolition.

533
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:23,800
And then that turned,

534
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,910
and so they that weren't having that after
there was a dozen of them, looks like,

535
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:29,620
let's not have that anymore.

536
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:35,500
She had many black men speaking
their mind from Alabama. And so they,

537
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:40,250
uh, you know, went back to
miscegenation laws, Jim Crow woman.

538
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:43,900
And I feel like this is the same
thing in a very poor metaphorical way.

539
00:30:43,901 --> 00:30:48,190
Like the Trayvon Martin case was a
case of a person standing their ground.

540
00:30:48,191 --> 00:30:49,240
And you know,
like those laws,

541
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:52,690
those laws are an extension of the
slave patrols when you didn't want black

542
00:30:52,691 --> 00:30:55,030
people wandering around at night
and they simply weren't allowed to.

543
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:58,300
And men gathered and rode
around and fucking rounded
them up and shit like that.

544
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,830
That's where those laws came from.

545
00:30:59,831 --> 00:31:03,220
If it's from the same time period after
the civil war and during the civil war,

546
00:31:03,221 --> 00:31:07,570
before the civil war, the ancient ancient
law, then it's a, it's as it's as,

547
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:11,530
it's as old fashioned as white guys
having a fucking whiskey after work, uh,

548
00:31:11,531 --> 00:31:14,320
on the plantation. And I was under
the impression that this stand,

549
00:31:14,321 --> 00:31:19,180
your ground law was fairly recent. It
is. I'm just saying the antecedent to it,

550
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:22,750
the, what precedes it is, uh,
uh, hundreds of years have,

551
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:26,680
let's make sure the undesirable people
aren't in our neighborhood after dark.

552
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:30,700
And by doing that, you've extended
it technically, as you know,

553
00:31:30,701 --> 00:31:32,800
that jury ruled the way
they were told to rule.

554
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:36,750
They didn't go out of their way to find
George Zimmerman innocent whenever they,

555
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,481
the judge said,

556
00:31:37,481 --> 00:31:40,990
you've got to go by the letter of this
law and underneath all the Pr, you know,

557
00:31:40,991 --> 00:31:43,540
blah, blah, blah. I'm not a
lawyer, nor do I play one on TV.

558
00:31:43,541 --> 00:31:48,340
I'm just an asshole with a big opinion.
There's like almost every case.

559
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:50,440
There's so much involved in it.

560
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:54,910
For an outsider like you or I to
say that we know what happened.

561
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:58,480
I always think that's so crazy and no
one knows what happened on the night.

562
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,160
And when I do know,

563
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:03,670
I do know that it probably wouldn't
have happened with a different kind of

564
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:04,450
person.

565
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:08,740
Like if there's certain people she'd
be sure there's certain people that can

566
00:32:08,741 --> 00:32:10,420
handle things socially,

567
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:15,900
altercations and then certain people who
are really poor communicators and they

568
00:32:16,091 --> 00:32:20,500
cause a lot of like a lot of issues
communicating with people and then their

569
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:25,090
arguments and sue that might
not necessarily have had
to and might not have if

570
00:32:25,091 --> 00:32:28,270
some cool dude who's like
the security patrol guy.

571
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:33,390
What's going on man? Everything cool.
Just got some skittles. I'm going, yeah,

572
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:36,530
that's it. Like nice,
friendly, you know, maybe it,

573
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:41,550
maybe this dude had been fucked with too
times by too many dickheads asking him

574
00:32:41,721 --> 00:32:46,190
questions and he was like, yeah, fuck
you. And he had built up, you know,

575
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:49,130
did you see the Kanye West Jimmy
Kimmel interview? I did not.

576
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:53,390
It was pretty interesting. And Kanye
West was super honest about it. You know,

577
00:32:53,391 --> 00:32:56,990
they have this big Twitter fight. And one
of the things Kanye West said was like,

578
00:32:56,991 --> 00:32:58,760
all these people were attacking him.

579
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,020
And so he had built up and then he'd
just exploded on the one person that he

580
00:33:03,021 --> 00:33:04,970
actually knew that it was totally,
you know,

581
00:33:04,971 --> 00:33:09,350
it's this disproportionate reaction that,
but it was just the same kind of thing.

582
00:33:09,351 --> 00:33:12,960
It was just build up that does,
didn't have an outlet and then boom.

583
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:17,860
Then it just goes all into that. Yeah.
Now, and I think you're right that,

584
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:22,370
uh, George Zimmerman was riding around,
probably spoiling a little bit for fight,

585
00:33:22,371 --> 00:33:26,480
and he was clearly huffy about guys in
the neighborhood and shit. And you know,

586
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,520
I mean,
in the end it could also could be,

587
00:33:28,521 --> 00:33:31,460
he's just a neighborhood watch guy and
he's trying to do his thing and there's a

588
00:33:31,461 --> 00:33:34,490
lot of shady people in the neighborhood
that's also possible. Could be,

589
00:33:34,491 --> 00:33:37,130
he could be, that's been a black
community for a hundred years.

590
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:40,910
But I'm saying there's still
a lot of criminals still.

591
00:33:40,911 --> 00:33:44,060
A lot of kids should just not saying just
because it's a black community doesn't

592
00:33:44,061 --> 00:33:47,300
mean it's crime Britain. No,
but the big thing is that he,

593
00:33:47,301 --> 00:33:51,080
there was a lot of breakins and that area,
right. So he was, yeah. Yeah. And He'd,

594
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:55,220
he'd had run INS with guys before. I
think that thing is, that's even more,

595
00:33:55,221 --> 00:33:57,820
you know, over arching than his, you know,

596
00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:01,010
reaction on the night to
fucking shoot somebody was as a,

597
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:05,880
which is horrible and tragic,
but uh, it's like what,

598
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:07,760
what it did in a,
in a,

599
00:34:07,761 --> 00:34:11,570
in almost a Rodney king or Oj waiting
the country to really be like a

600
00:34:11,571 --> 00:34:14,990
thunderclap that just fucked
everybody over. And you know, again,

601
00:34:14,991 --> 00:34:17,900
pointing out the inequity
that there's two sets of laws,

602
00:34:17,901 --> 00:34:21,470
one for the underclass and one for
everybody else and that, you know,

603
00:34:21,471 --> 00:34:24,240
nothing's fair and,
and the racial divide and it,

604
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:26,720
it's just something that I
thought it was really destructive,

605
00:34:26,721 --> 00:34:31,160
like as an emotional. Also
the media of course, you know,

606
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:33,650
amped it up to insane levels,
but it's true.

607
00:34:33,651 --> 00:34:37,520
And it's also something we're fighting
through. I think even with this shutdown,

608
00:34:37,521 --> 00:34:41,180
I think is a, if you'll
look at the teams, you know,

609
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:45,320
there's a racial element
to this that's undeniable,

610
00:34:45,321 --> 00:34:49,080
that carries through in everything
since this country was born. Well,

611
00:34:49,081 --> 00:34:53,330
do you think that if he was some white
trash kid that was in the neighborhood,

612
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:56,420
some, uh, angry white dude
with like love and hate,

613
00:34:56,421 --> 00:34:58,940
tattooed on his knuckles
and Zimmerman shot him,

614
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:02,300
do think they're same thing
would've happened? I don't know.

615
00:35:02,301 --> 00:35:05,110
I think he might've been acquitted
still because of the, of the law,

616
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:06,680
the letter of that law.
It,

617
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:11,420
he was in his defense and I'm not a
Zimmerman apologist. And I, as I said,

618
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:16,040
I'll be super clear. Um, I was not
there. I don't know what happened.

619
00:35:16,041 --> 00:35:18,590
I would not say I know what happened.
I don't know.

620
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,040
I do know that Zimmerman's
face was fucked up.

621
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:25,250
And I do know he had cuts in the back
of his head from his head being bounced

622
00:35:25,251 --> 00:35:28,380
off the ground. So he was
getting his ass kicked. And I,

623
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:33,050
I've gotten my ass kicked before.
It's a terrifying fee. Atis. And, um,

624
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:38,130
if he was getting his ass kicked and
this guy was in danger of hurting

625
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:41,100
him, that's the whole, the whole
reason the law exists. Yes.

626
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:44,010
You should be able to defend yourself
with a gun because without a gun,

627
00:35:44,011 --> 00:35:46,980
you're at the mercy of this asshole's
beating the shit out of you. Right.

628
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:49,920
I'm not saying that he
didn't instigate the fight.

629
00:35:49,921 --> 00:35:53,250
He's going to sit and take the gray
area comes with what proceeded. Sure.

630
00:35:53,251 --> 00:35:56,460
Fracas he could die there. That's
make no mistake about it. Yeah.

631
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:59,610
It's pretty easy for someone to die in
a street fight. Oh hell yeah. It is.

632
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:01,320
Especially with concrete is going to say,

633
00:36:01,321 --> 00:36:04,290
as soon as your head hits the fucking
streets, super easy to get knocked out.

634
00:36:04,291 --> 00:36:07,560
Super easy to fall down, smash your
head and never be the same again.

635
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:09,540
Like it's really scary scenario.

636
00:36:09,541 --> 00:36:13,470
So if you are a fighting this kid
who's like in better shape than you,

637
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:17,500
he's kicking your fucking ass. Like you're
in danger of dying. Like that's real.

638
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,590
Like your life is
essentially in his hands.

639
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:23,220
He might punch a few times when you're
out and walk away or he might stomp you

640
00:36:23,221 --> 00:36:27,210
to death. He could do that if he
wants to. It's up to him and he's,

641
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:31,950
he's so enraged that you're in a physical
altercation with your bodies where

642
00:36:31,951 --> 00:36:34,710
you're fighting for your life to the
point where you have to pull a gun out.

643
00:36:34,711 --> 00:36:36,100
Well,
I think that the pointless,

644
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:39,940
like he's not a policeman and he
challenged to this guy and you know,

645
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:44,250
do we know that? See, I don't know
what exactly. So that's the problem.

646
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:48,030
So I'm not,
I'm not making any,

647
00:36:48,031 --> 00:36:49,930
there wasn't a police
call and all that jazz,

648
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:53,430
unless that didn't happen according to
the, the police call definitely happened.

649
00:36:53,431 --> 00:36:56,310
But what's interesting about the police
call that happened was that they edited

650
00:36:56,311 --> 00:37:00,300
it. They asked you what does he look
like? And he said he's a black guy.

651
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:03,450
But when they played it on the air,
they edited it.

652
00:37:03,451 --> 00:37:07,530
So they cut out the woman we Lorraine's
question. So they changed it.

653
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:10,230
Here's this guy looks suspicious,
he's a black guy.

654
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,670
So they edited out the question.

655
00:37:11,671 --> 00:37:15,090
They made it look like he was
pointing out that he's a black guy.

656
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:19,530
He thinks about it. The media was never
said July did all of a sudden they were,

657
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:22,740
they, no, no one's going to support
it again for a couple of weeks.

658
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:25,800
No one's innocent in this. No
one's innocent in this. Of course,

659
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:28,320
the number one tragedies
that this guy lost his life.

660
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:33,660
I try to tell young men if they would,
if anyone who's willing to listen,

661
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:39,210
if foleyed conflict at
all costs at all costs,

662
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:41,100
there's no need to fight people.

663
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:45,510
I was at the beach this weekend and this
guy was giving me the finger is older

664
00:37:45,511 --> 00:37:50,460
dude, I'm sure you know, I don't
think he knew who I was or had any,

665
00:37:50,461 --> 00:37:54,900
uh, idea that, uh, Sherry,
wasn't it disgruntled lesson?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

666
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:57,590
I don't think he had any idea.
You know,

667
00:37:57,690 --> 00:38:00,880
that I was a nice person
and that I could have, uh,

668
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,150
talked to him through this and
everything could have been fine,

669
00:38:03,151 --> 00:38:05,670
but there was a bunch of kids playing.
It was my friend's kids.

670
00:38:05,671 --> 00:38:10,050
And my kids and they were playing
here, this a cove area. And um,

671
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:14,130
this guy had set up his, uh, his,
his blanket there on a public beach,

672
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,280
but there's people all over the place and
these kids wanted to play in this cove

673
00:38:17,281 --> 00:38:20,310
area.
And so this guy got so pissed off.

674
00:38:20,311 --> 00:38:23,120
We came here for a little peace and
quiet and we didn't want to be, you know,

675
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:27,480
people right on top of us. And I just
smiled at the guy, didn't say anything,

676
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:30,810
I just smiled the guy. I'm like,
yeah, it was so ridiculous.

677
00:38:30,811 --> 00:38:32,340
There's no way I'm going
even to argue with you.

678
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:35,980
You're the public beach and little kids
are playing to this fucking people all

679
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,590
over the place, man. Just cause people
came near you. Cause you don't have this,

680
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:40,390
you don't own the spot next to your spot.

681
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:44,380
You don't have like a specific amount
of room and the guy gives me the finger

682
00:38:44,381 --> 00:38:47,910
and I'm like, you're so crazy.
Like you're, you're like in,

683
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:50,530
you're engaging someone you
didn't know nothing about.

684
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:51,700
You don't know anything about me.

685
00:38:51,701 --> 00:38:55,600
I could be a real mean guy
and I could just decide, oh,

686
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:59,080
you just gave me an excuse to beat the
fuck out of you and there's nothing you

687
00:38:59,081 --> 00:38:59,861
can do about it.

688
00:38:59,861 --> 00:39:02,620
I'm just going to grab you and start
smacking you around and you're going to be

689
00:39:02,621 --> 00:39:04,570
terrified.
And you gave me the green light,

690
00:39:04,571 --> 00:39:06,280
you gave me the finger and why
don't you give me the finger bitch?

691
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:10,630
There's a lot of nutty people like that
out there. So I, I saw this guy do this.

692
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:11,171
I'm like,
wow.

693
00:39:11,171 --> 00:39:15,910
Have you never experienced like a really
crazy person before you like inviting

694
00:39:15,911 --> 00:39:18,150
crazy people into your life?
Is that what you're doing? Yes.

695
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,840
Like people who would do
that with driving too.

696
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:24,570
They play games and cut people off
and hit the brakes. I dated a girl,

697
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:28,420
he used to do that. She was great, great
person. But she's very competitive.

698
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:30,550
When it came to driving,

699
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:34,300
she got ultra competitive with people
and if people tried to cut her off,

700
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:37,870
she would go into oncoming traffic and
cut in front of them with me in the car.

701
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:42,700
And I was like, listen, you gotta
listen to me. You are going to get hurt.

702
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,020
You're going to hurt me.

703
00:39:44,021 --> 00:39:47,030
You're going to hurt them because
they got in front of your con.

704
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:51,910
They made you go to your place two
seconds later. This is crazy. But yeah,

705
00:39:51,911 --> 00:39:54,010
they did a douchey move.
They suck at driving.

706
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:57,090
Do you don't have to speed in front
of oncoming traffic and cut them off.

707
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:00,160
You know you have to let them know, fuck
them. You don't have to take, you know,

708
00:40:00,161 --> 00:40:03,670
I'm like, okay, you're, you
can't, you can't be serious.

709
00:40:03,671 --> 00:40:05,680
Like this is a nutty
way of approaching life.

710
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:09,130
Like you're going to make
an enemy of a crazy person.

711
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,230
You're going to do with
danger everywhere you go,

712
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:13,210
you're going to do it in
the wrong spot. You, you.

713
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:17,650
There's a broad spectrum of people you
can and can't piss off and if you piss

714
00:40:17,651 --> 00:40:21,640
off the wrong people, you, you're
in serious fucking danger. Oh yeah.

715
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,950
That's the thing that
drives me crazy that La,

716
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:25,900
I mean you're talking about
this guy in the beach and stuff,

717
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:30,340
people that thing that I think people in
general are now I sit in la except when

718
00:40:30,341 --> 00:40:34,390
they're behind the wheel really wears
down on my soul here because there's no

719
00:40:34,391 --> 00:40:37,420
other city in the country where people
treat you the way they do it in La.

720
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:40,360
I think we're panicking. I think
everybody Oughta, there's, yeah,

721
00:40:40,361 --> 00:40:43,150
there's so much traffic
that people just panicking.

722
00:40:43,151 --> 00:40:46,900
They're just fucking trying to get home
quicker and cut in front of people and I

723
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:50,420
just take it out of my job madness.
If I pull out of my drive,

724
00:40:50,421 --> 00:40:54,970
I yesterday at dude on Sunday I
go to my wife watched this guy,

725
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:57,220
he's going to try to pass
me coming around the riot.

726
00:40:57,250 --> 00:41:01,180
I'm just coming out of the driveway and
he yup, speed it up, fucking one around,

727
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:05,350
made it inches, you know, death defying
Ben Hur fucking bullshit. And I'm like,

728
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:08,110
then we were right behind him
at the light and you're like,

729
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:11,380
well you're fucking 40 centimeters ahead.
And they did.

730
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:15,250
He got a big w out of that one.
People drive cars the way they live life,

731
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,330
but that's what I mean.
It's like it reflects on
everything. Yeah, you're strong.

732
00:41:19,331 --> 00:41:21,750
Can you open these?
What are those mints?

733
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:28,110
I know it's just like having an actress
on this shift. Thank you brother.

734
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:33,040
Would you like a then you
guys, we've got one over.

735
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:34,003
Thank you.

736
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:36,380
Yeah, I'm in delicious.
What'd you like him then?

737
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:42,740
I'm going to open it up meant to laugh
at me and my inability to open this.

738
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:47,840
Joe will attest that these this weekend.
Exactly. Those things are tricky.

739
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:49,840
Or are you good at jars it?

740
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:54,590
You know what doctor fuck off my ass is
what I'm good at. You know what? I'm too,

741
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:58,670
yeah. The jar that I struggle with
and I'm like, this is ridiculous.

742
00:41:58,671 --> 00:42:00,680
Like what if I was some Old Lady?
I wanted to get a pickle,

743
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,950
but I'm never opening this. I'm going
to have to open this with a hammer.

744
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:07,130
Like if I was an old lady and I got
to one that I'm serious. Pickle jars.

745
00:42:07,131 --> 00:42:11,090
Like you can't open them
bitches. No. Right, right. Yeah.

746
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,820
You know,
that's why they have those tools,

747
00:42:13,821 --> 00:42:15,590
those little rubber
things you put on the top.

748
00:42:15,591 --> 00:42:20,000
That's like grip it better and stuff.
I use the a kitchen sink gloves,

749
00:42:20,001 --> 00:42:22,930
but even then sometimes, wow, that's
a good call. Yeah, that's good.

750
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:26,960
You get a good grip. Yeah,
you need a grip, but it just
seems like a silly thing.

751
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:30,620
Like you're, you're making these so
hard to open. Yeah. Like it's almost,

752
00:42:30,621 --> 00:42:33,770
you need tools. On the other
hand, in the Zombie apocalypse,

753
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:38,150
you'll be able to swan end to any charge
food store and really live off that

754
00:42:38,151 --> 00:42:40,940
ship for awhile.
The Zombie apocalypse is already happened.

755
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,140
Have you seen this crocodile drug
that these, uh, it came from?

756
00:42:45,141 --> 00:42:49,070
Russia crop could deal. They're calling
you and stuff like that. It's um,

757
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:53,270
it's a supplement for heroin for people
who don't have heroin or they just want

758
00:42:53,271 --> 00:42:57,740
to try this when they're
the sick of killing himself
with heroin and it actually

759
00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:02,720
rots Skinaway. Wow. Like
literally giant chunks of flesh,

760
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:05,480
exposed bone and all these
people that are taking it.

761
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:09,800
It's here in Los Angeles now too. Yeah,
I've heard. It's insane. It's insane.

762
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:14,390
It's highest clowns. I think it's deal.
I've only seen it written. I haven't,

763
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:17,300
I know vice has a documentary on it,
but I didn't watch it.

764
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:21,620
It's so depressing man. Oh my God.
Last time I was here it was bath salts.

765
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:26,420
That's right. But this one, when that
dude eight, that dude's face. Yeah, right.

766
00:43:26,421 --> 00:43:27,800
Wasn't it?
Around that same time,

767
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:30,140
it turned out to be just weed
and he just had the munchies.

768
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:32,270
That's what they said it was weed.

769
00:43:32,330 --> 00:43:35,240
But the problem with that is of course
you know that we'd stays in your system

770
00:43:35,241 --> 00:43:36,230
for many,
many weeks.

771
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:40,270
That's why fighters take like five
weeks off and they still get popped now

772
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:42,770
because you know the,
the weed just shows up in your system.

773
00:43:42,771 --> 00:43:44,810
It's really hard to get
wheat out of your system.

774
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:49,130
So like he probably wasn't really high.
He probably just had gotten high.

775
00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:53,630
And the thing about it's testing them
for bath salts is there is no test for

776
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:56,870
bass off. That's the big trek. So
when they say that there was nothing,

777
00:43:57,090 --> 00:43:59,180
the only thing that we found
in his system was marijuana.

778
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:01,910
They're not saying he wasn't
on bath salts, they're just,

779
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,790
they're not admitting that they
don't have a test for the fucking,

780
00:44:04,791 --> 00:44:07,730
these crazy drugs that
people just keep inventing.

781
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,100
They don't have tests for them.
So then saying,

782
00:44:10,101 --> 00:44:14,240
well he was high on marijuana and there's
new drugs in like basically every week

783
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,460
there's new drugs cause
there's just people tinkering.

784
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:20,900
It's got so tired of people trying to
pretend that that was actually what

785
00:44:20,901 --> 00:44:24,280
happened. The guy who got high
and eight, this dude's face. No,

786
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:27,890
that's some silly shit.
Yeah it was.

787
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:32,070
But this croc deal or whatever,
it is the latest,

788
00:44:32,071 --> 00:44:35,970
greatest and the most disturbing
by far. That's wild. It's really,

789
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:38,860
I'll show you some pictures. You
want to see some veterans? No. Okay.

790
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:42,690
I'm really sensitive and a us can eat
some barbecue lighter. So I was to,

791
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:47,100
it won't hurt you. You're, you're old and
wise enough to know. It doesn't matter.

792
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:51,750
It would just be able to separate and
enjoy your ribs. Just dig right in.

793
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:57,150
It really does look like some walking
dead shit though. Really is like,

794
00:44:57,151 --> 00:45:00,270
people just have giant chunks rotted
away from their skin and they're still

795
00:45:00,271 --> 00:45:04,200
alive. Somehow. Jesus fucking quite high.

796
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:07,660
It makes you want to do that too.
That's so good that you're like, Shit.

797
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:11,210
First it falls off and you're like,
okay, I'm still getting more. Yes.

798
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:15,180
A couple more. Yeah. And how long does it
take before it makes your skin fall off?

799
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:17,070
Does it get,
does it happen right away?

800
00:45:17,071 --> 00:45:19,560
And that's why everybody has their
skin fall off. Or is it like,

801
00:45:19,561 --> 00:45:23,400
do you have to be a real asshole and stick
with this fucking drug for six months?

802
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:26,460
You know,
waiting for it to rot your skin away.

803
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:29,920
People are just so self destructive.

804
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:33,870
And now what the fuck is that Greg?
Proof? I don't know about him.

805
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:39,070
I'm sitting right here and I can
hear you. Yeah. What is that? Uh,

806
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:44,220
I mean, like you say that thing. What did
she say about La? People are panicked.

807
00:45:44,490 --> 00:45:45,870
I think there's too many of us.

808
00:45:46,170 --> 00:45:50,280
And I think when you look at
rat population density studies,

809
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:51,660
uh,

810
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:56,150
I listened to some
online talk by a police.

811
00:45:56,170 --> 00:46:01,170
If it was a art bell was
talking to Terrence Mckenna
and they were talking about

812
00:46:01,861 --> 00:46:06,450
a population density studies they did
on rats and that at a certain point in

813
00:46:06,451 --> 00:46:10,500
time you get enough rats in the room,
rats start doing crazy shit like that.

814
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:12,660
You have one or two rats in the room.
Everybody's cool.

815
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:15,400
You have a hundred rats in the room.
Things get a little sketch.

816
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:20,550
When you pay 5,000 rats, they start
eating each other. They started one of,

817
00:46:20,551 --> 00:46:22,620
some of them will hide in
the corners and just nod.

818
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:25,590
They like mimic human
crazy behave. Right, right.

819
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:29,040
I think we're not supposed to wear,
I don't think we're designed,

820
00:46:29,041 --> 00:46:30,090
I think we're improving,

821
00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:33,900
but I don't think we're necessarily
designed to be around this many fucking

822
00:46:33,901 --> 00:46:37,620
people and it is pretty dense
that, yeah, especially Los Angeles.

823
00:46:37,621 --> 00:46:38,371
Even in Los Angeles,

824
00:46:38,371 --> 00:46:41,160
a little more spread out than like
say New York or something. Yes,

825
00:46:41,161 --> 00:46:42,780
it's definitely more spread
out to New York. Look.

826
00:46:42,781 --> 00:46:46,980
And the thing about Los Angeles,
most people that if you live in a house,

827
00:46:46,981 --> 00:46:50,000
you probably have like a yard, you know?
And you know people that have a yard.

828
00:46:50,001 --> 00:46:52,500
It's something that's a nice thing to
have. Yeah, it is. It's a privilege.

829
00:46:52,501 --> 00:46:55,290
You don't get that in New York,
New York City. Good fucking luck.

830
00:46:55,291 --> 00:46:59,190
You might get a little terrace.
Yeah. If you're rich or flower box,

831
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:04,140
you've got a little flower box. You just,
it's concrete everywhere. Fuck that.

832
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:07,690
Well, it's interesting
though. There's a lot to,

833
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:11,910
there's a lot of benefit to New
York. It's, it's weird, but it's,

834
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:17,000
you're basically on a buzz all the time
because like it or not the p the people

835
00:47:17,581 --> 00:47:19,890
around you influenced the way you feel.

836
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:24,000
The energy that you have in New
York is like this move in town.

837
00:47:24,001 --> 00:47:27,570
There's so much going on. There's so
many people. You just go, all right,

838
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:31,750
here we go. And almost like
Popsie up a notch. And you know,

839
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:36,410
I think there's something to that. I
think there's something to, to the, the,

840
00:47:36,411 --> 00:47:39,070
the juice that you get from
being around that many people,

841
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:42,100
but it's not for everybody. No, it isn't.

842
00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:45,910
But you do you feel like something's
going on and you might be missing it. Yes.

843
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:49,420
Uh, I liked that too. I like San Francisco
that get, well, one, I'm from there,

844
00:47:49,421 --> 00:47:52,900
but in the daytime you can be around
people if you want. And then like,

845
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:55,540
I always find that there's
always unbelievable empty,

846
00:47:55,541 --> 00:47:57,580
quiet spaces no matter where
you go in San Francisco,

847
00:47:57,581 --> 00:48:00,730
even in the middle of the day or
night or Friday night, it's never,

848
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:05,950
it's never as bustling as New York. Well,
it's an unusually smart town. I mean,

849
00:48:05,951 --> 00:48:08,710
I think New York is kind of
unusually smart a lot of ways too.

850
00:48:08,910 --> 00:48:13,440
There's MS obviously a lot of dumb people
all over the land, but there's the,

851
00:48:13,441 --> 00:48:17,800
the high pockets of smart people that
you can meet at the museum in New York or

852
00:48:17,801 --> 00:48:21,340
the high pockets of smart people that
you can meet and a million different

853
00:48:21,341 --> 00:48:22,660
places in San Francisco.
I mean,

854
00:48:22,661 --> 00:48:25,880
that is literally the tech tech
capital of this country. Yeah.

855
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:28,800
The brightest minds from
Google and apple and other,

856
00:48:28,810 --> 00:48:33,050
all in that northern California area.
So if you thought about that and just,

857
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:35,440
just that as a city,
like that's what,

858
00:48:35,470 --> 00:48:40,470
that's gotta be one of the
best congestion's of minds
that we have little g she

859
00:48:41,191 --> 00:48:45,010
San Francisco, it's impossible
to not be, you know,

860
00:48:45,070 --> 00:48:46,690
it's impossible to not be.

861
00:48:46,691 --> 00:48:50,170
If you been Uber successful with
a bunch of different companies,

862
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:53,020
a lot of really smart people.
It's just,

863
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,300
I think it's probably the
smartest spot in the country.

864
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:59,440
The concentration is certainly an intense,
I feel it when I performed there.

865
00:48:59,830 --> 00:49:02,440
Oh yeah, you do because people
will know what's going on. Yeah.

866
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:05,390
They just seem more, they seemed
really tuned in. You know,

867
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:09,480
I did one of my specials, my,
uh, 2006 shiny happy Jihad.

868
00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:12,740
They did it at Cobbs and uh, so
one of my favorite ones, I just,

869
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,790
I just always felt like San
Francisco audiences have just,

870
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:20,230
there's something about them, you know,
they're just like one notch smarter.

871
00:49:21,230 --> 00:49:24,820
Certainly my favorite Krug's I've
always loved them just one notch.

872
00:49:24,850 --> 00:49:29,700
I think that La Crowds, it depends on
what you play can be really amazing.

873
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:32,170
You can get one notch smarter
here too. And you, by the way,

874
00:49:32,171 --> 00:49:36,620
you get one notch smarter and Columbus,
Ohio is if they come to see you, you know,

875
00:49:36,621 --> 00:49:37,391
if the people know you.

876
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:42,370
But I just always found that collect
coming up that like they almost demanded

877
00:49:42,371 --> 00:49:46,750
more too. I think. So. I mean I, I came
from San Francisco from the old days,

878
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:48,820
you know, from the 80s. And uh,

879
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:53,620
there was a lot of really crazy Craig's
common and if you were hacky in any way,

880
00:49:53,621 --> 00:49:57,160
that was kind of frowned upon and it
was really important to keep pushing the

881
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:01,330
conceptual law envelope and stuff
like that if we were famous for never

882
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:03,070
succeeding in La,
you know,

883
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:06,550
on stage because the ideas
are too abstruse and stuff.

884
00:50:06,551 --> 00:50:10,480
And then of course now everyone that
I know in La is from San Francisco.

885
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:14,800
Well don't you think that comedy is just
so evolved so much since then? You know,

886
00:50:14,801 --> 00:50:18,460
the, the, uh, the public's perception of
comedy as well because of the Internet.

887
00:50:18,461 --> 00:50:23,461
I think people are just a way blue
broader palate also is fueled by the club

888
00:50:24,191 --> 00:50:27,920
scene then and it's not as much anymore.
Yeah. They do have a way broader pallet.

889
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:31,610
Yeah. The scene was all about the club
scene. Now it's still is Kinda, yeah.

890
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:33,890
I mean there's still spots like,
you know,

891
00:50:33,891 --> 00:50:36,800
the seller in New York that
just draws people to it,

892
00:50:36,801 --> 00:50:41,210
of the Improv and Hollywood draws people
to it. The comedy store, of course,

893
00:50:41,211 --> 00:50:44,810
you know, there's always going to
be that. But I think that the, the,

894
00:50:44,811 --> 00:50:48,380
the ability to promote on the Internet
is the thing that changed comedy the most

895
00:50:48,381 --> 00:50:50,720
over the last few years.
Absolutely.

896
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:55,680
And it's allowed us the luxury of taking
back the means of production. Yeah.

897
00:50:55,970 --> 00:51:00,470
Removing a lot of middlemen that
we're not, uh, it turns out necessary.

898
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:04,410
And it also allows Greg Proops
to be Greg Proops. Like,

899
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:09,260
you can do your podcast and no one
gives you a hard time about anything.

900
00:51:09,261 --> 00:51:13,620
You make all the decisions. It's not even
a compromise necessary. Like now, Greg,

901
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:17,400
I was thinking today because it's
president's Day, right? Like,

902
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:21,740
maybe you just do this thing
about presidents and like,
hey fuck head, you know,

903
00:51:21,741 --> 00:51:24,470
like what did you go make
your own podcast. Okay.

904
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:28,790
I everybody has ideas that they want
to stick in your face and they might be

905
00:51:28,791 --> 00:51:32,110
good ideas but I don't want to land now.

906
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:35,440
And that's the thing that's so great
about this is the under, like you said,

907
00:51:35,450 --> 00:51:37,370
just the unbelievable self
determination for freedom.

908
00:51:37,550 --> 00:51:40,250
And I take responsibility for
it. If the show sucks, I'm like,

909
00:51:40,251 --> 00:51:42,770
that one wasn't as good or you know,
I'll try to do it better.

910
00:51:42,771 --> 00:51:46,010
And I listened to him back and think,
well, that could, uh, that could have,

911
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:49,100
I'm a little more, it's just so
effortless, you know? I mean,

912
00:51:49,130 --> 00:51:52,670
without being effortless,
look, it always requires, like,

913
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:54,650
I always feel like podcasts,

914
00:51:54,890 --> 00:51:56,870
the most important things that
I'd just be paying attention to.

915
00:51:56,870 --> 00:51:57,920
What the fuck's going on in the world.

916
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:00,200
As long as you're paying attention to
what's going on in the world is always

917
00:52:00,201 --> 00:52:01,810
going to be something to talk about.
Oh,

918
00:52:01,830 --> 00:52:06,830
I live in the most bizarre time ever
and we're the most like content rich

919
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:09,290
comedians ever everyday.

920
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:13,820
Some insane new stories that you
can't fucking believe is real, but is,

921
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:18,170
you know about a clam and a penis and a
fucking, who knows? You know what I mean?

922
00:52:18,171 --> 00:52:20,750
There's like, there's always
some new fucking insane story.

923
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:24,340
It's like you never run out of
comedy. It's impossible today. No.

924
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:25,550
And that's what someone said,
Jay,

925
00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:28,940
like as I do mind by myself and they go
[inaudible] you run out of material and

926
00:52:28,941 --> 00:52:32,090
it's like, really not
today. Nah, not anymore.

927
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:36,140
I'll have to do is go on the Internet
and write a paper and do this and talk to

928
00:52:36,141 --> 00:52:38,860
people. And there's
5,000 things. Do you, um,

929
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:42,650
infiltrate other communities
that you don't agree with?

930
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:46,970
Do you ever like go to like
really conservative websites
are either forums and I

931
00:52:46,971 --> 00:52:51,140
do, and I'll go to a lunch
tray. I think you'd have to,

932
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:53,270
I was just reading,
speaking of infiltrating,

933
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:57,830
there was an interview and I think it
was New York magazine with a Antonin

934
00:52:57,830 --> 00:53:00,890
Scalia and they asked him the
question and what did you,

935
00:53:00,891 --> 00:53:02,920
what do you read in the morning
and shit? And he said, uh,

936
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:07,580
I read the Washington Times and the
Wall Street Journal, and the guy goes,

937
00:53:07,581 --> 00:53:11,000
you don't read the post. And he
goes, I used to read the post,

938
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:14,000
but I found that
everything was too liberal.

939
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:18,260
And then he went and the guy wants, so no
New York Times at all. And he was like,

940
00:53:18,261 --> 00:53:22,850
no, I never read the New York Times. And
I thought, okay, look, I'm a comedian.

941
00:53:22,851 --> 00:53:26,110
I have no responsibility to the public.
I'm not holding a secured

942
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:30,720
position where I'm adjudicating on fucking
matters of grave national importance

943
00:53:30,721 --> 00:53:35,100
every day of my life and writing opinions
and being a deciding vote on a fucking

944
00:53:35,101 --> 00:53:38,220
panel of nine people who were
hand chosen by psychopaths.

945
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:44,010
And yet I have the capital loss city of
taste to fucking watch Fox News every

946
00:53:44,011 --> 00:53:47,760
once in a while. And I don't go on,
I got, you know, like you just go,

947
00:53:47,761 --> 00:53:52,380
like you can't read the New York Times
because it upsets you too much and you're

948
00:53:52,381 --> 00:53:57,000
a justice. Like how narrow is your
fucking purview? You know what I mean?

949
00:53:57,001 --> 00:54:00,690
Like why don't you say, I don't
believe anything out, you know?

950
00:54:00,691 --> 00:54:03,780
And then he talks about how he
believes in the devil and whatnot.

951
00:54:03,781 --> 00:54:07,770
And you're like, we're getting kind
of weird here with the justice. Like,

952
00:54:08,490 --> 00:54:13,160
I mean, who is that? He believed
Janine Scalia. Oh no, he didn't. Yeah,

953
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:16,500
he health guilt. You could go online and
look up the interview when you read it.

954
00:54:16,501 --> 00:54:21,120
It was just, but I like to
think of what's, fuck you
man. I read, I w I read Fox.

955
00:54:21,210 --> 00:54:25,410
I'll read, cause I read news stories on
my show and I'll say this is from this,

956
00:54:25,411 --> 00:54:28,800
you know, and obviously I read a lot from
the Guardian or Truthout or whatever,

957
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:30,480
you know,
but I'll also go,

958
00:54:30,510 --> 00:54:33,410
this is from Fox News or this is from
CNN or this is from a right wing,

959
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:34,320
the Wall Street Journal.

960
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:37,350
I read a piece from the Wall
Street Journal about the
fucking former head of the,

961
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:40,740
uh, Shearson Lehman and shit.
And I, because Richard Fault,

962
00:54:40,741 --> 00:54:45,240
someone said he's a survivor. And I
said, he's a fucking criminal. You know,

963
00:54:45,241 --> 00:54:48,120
he started a new company on Wall Street
and all we're supposed to feel sorry for

964
00:54:48,121 --> 00:54:51,600
him that he's so brave that he
weathered the 2008 collapse.

965
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:52,890
Like you engineered it.

966
00:54:53,250 --> 00:54:57,180
Even people in the financial community
blamed him for it was like, well,

967
00:54:57,870 --> 00:55:00,560
well they can a survivor that's a quote,
you know,

968
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:04,590
paint things and a beautiful of
course. But I mean, Scalia said that.

969
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:07,260
And so when you asked me do I
infiltrate it? It's like, no. Do I,

970
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:09,300
do I watch a steady diet of Fox News?
No.

971
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:11,490
Do I read right when you
just to all the time, no.

972
00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:14,160
Do I try to read stuff from all over
the world from different points of view?

973
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:17,640
Yeah. Yeah. That's why Greg,
cause it's interesting,

974
00:55:18,270 --> 00:55:20,040
you don't have to agree
with everything you read.

975
00:55:20,070 --> 00:55:21,690
And I always say this
to people about comedy.

976
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:24,690
Do people that come and see you and don't
like your politics and then get up in

977
00:55:24,691 --> 00:55:29,400
a huff and fuck off. I always think you're
not sophisticated, not sophisticated.

978
00:55:29,401 --> 00:55:32,750
And I don't mean that in like a smart or
like you went to college way. I mean, uh,

979
00:55:33,210 --> 00:55:37,980
there are people who have no education
who can understand a whole bunch of ideas

980
00:55:37,981 --> 00:55:42,330
at once and see the humor of, you know
what I mean? Well, there's some people,

981
00:55:42,331 --> 00:55:45,480
there's lines you cannot cross.
Their pea brains won't allow it.

982
00:55:45,481 --> 00:55:49,230
But that's what I mean, like come
back to subject. That's off limits.

983
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,790
Mostly.
I find that if you are disagreeing,

984
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:56,610
I remember last year or two years
ago when the election was going,

985
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:00,660
I did a joke in Eugene or Portland.
Oh No. One of the places in Oregon,

986
00:56:00,661 --> 00:56:03,950
it wasn't in Eugene, which is wicked
liberal, but it was a clown with law.

987
00:56:03,951 --> 00:56:06,320
I don't know where the fuck I was in
Oregon. It was a city in Oregon. And uh,

988
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:07,801
I said something,

989
00:56:07,801 --> 00:56:11,910
I said that the Republican nominees aren't
just the worst group of nominees I've

990
00:56:11,911 --> 00:56:14,400
ever seen from the Republican
Party in my lifetime there,

991
00:56:14,401 --> 00:56:17,430
the Reus Group of people I've
ever seen in a room, you know,

992
00:56:17,431 --> 00:56:18,660
and started to go through them.

993
00:56:18,870 --> 00:56:23,000
And when it was Herman Cain and Newt
Gingrich and someone in the backyard, no,

994
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:28,330
it was like, no, you don't
get to veto jokes. And a guy,

995
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:30,880
I'm not kidding.
A Guy wrote me the other day on my email.

996
00:56:30,881 --> 00:56:33,640
Like I take email from people and
I read it, I don't know his answer,

997
00:56:33,641 --> 00:56:38,641
but any road I was at your show
in Chicago and it was podcast.

998
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:44,470
So my podcast is not advertised
as a standup show. It says
podcast, you know, like,

999
00:56:44,471 --> 00:56:46,750
and therefore there's a
different thing that's happening.

1000
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:50,680
It's a lot more real and you
know, unless you know, and uh,

1001
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:51,950
he wrote me and he said,
ah,

1002
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,940
I didn't spend this 20 bucks or
whatever to hear your fucking politics.

1003
00:56:54,941 --> 00:56:56,140
And I didn't think it was very funny.

1004
00:56:56,141 --> 00:56:58,420
And anyone that would like to
show it'd be a halfwit and shit.

1005
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:02,470
So normally I would just block
him, you know, but I thought,

1006
00:57:02,471 --> 00:57:04,840
I'm going to write him back
and I realize you're hostile.

1007
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:09,840
Tone is not conducive to
discourse and understand this,

1008
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,000
you chose to come in the room and you
pay it if you'd asked for a refund of the

1009
00:57:13,001 --> 00:57:17,320
time, that's another matter. And I go,
and by the way, after the show's over,

1010
00:57:17,321 --> 00:57:21,040
you don't get to email the artist and
ask for your money back because you

1011
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:24,250
disagreed with them.
You take your chances,

1012
00:57:24,251 --> 00:57:27,580
whether you go to see a symphony or a
movie or a fucking whatever it is you're

1013
00:57:27,581 --> 00:57:29,590
going to go see, man, when
you go to Jack in the box,

1014
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:31,540
you might not like them sausages,

1015
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:35,230
but you don't get to fucking
write me after and tell me
you want your money back.

1016
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:38,680
And then say everyone that liked it was
a moron when he was the only one who

1017
00:57:38,681 --> 00:57:41,770
didn't like it. You know? And it's
like, I don't understand that. Well,

1018
00:57:41,771 --> 00:57:42,520
there's always going to be

1019
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:47,350
people that can't wrap their head around
the idea that there's different people

1020
00:57:47,351 --> 00:57:51,640
and different people like different stuff.
Yeah. And if you don't like something,

1021
00:57:51,730 --> 00:57:54,940
it's okay.
If there were other people enjoying it,

1022
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:58,210
well then you know that's for them.
It's not for you.

1023
00:57:58,580 --> 00:58:01,060
But the anger like letter like I didn't,

1024
00:58:01,061 --> 00:58:03,910
I don't like your politics on all
our fucking, that wasn't very funny.

1025
00:58:03,911 --> 00:58:07,300
And the people are assholes. And just
sending that letter, you're an asshole.

1026
00:58:07,570 --> 00:58:09,780
[inaudible] mean you might want to
tell one of your friends like that.

1027
00:58:09,781 --> 00:58:13,390
I didn't have a good time. He's talking
all this liberal shit. I, Trayvon Martins,

1028
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:17,360
by the way, the not yet. The
night I did it was uh, uh,

1029
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:22,180
the 50th anniversary of the march on
Washington for jobs and freedom and I

1030
00:58:22,181 --> 00:58:25,930
played a clip of Martin Luther King
speech, the part I have a dream and shit.

1031
00:58:25,931 --> 00:58:26,171
You know,

1032
00:58:26,171 --> 00:58:28,690
cause I didn't think that crowd had
heard it before because a lot of young

1033
00:58:28,691 --> 00:58:33,400
people who haven't heard it. Exactly.
And everybody listened really intently.

1034
00:58:33,401 --> 00:58:35,860
And I thought this is
what you objected to.

1035
00:58:35,861 --> 00:58:40,861
You objected to the biggest cry for
peace in the last fucking 50 years.

1036
00:58:42,430 --> 00:58:45,900
What were the other controversial points
that were discussed in the pocket? Oh,

1037
00:58:45,910 --> 00:58:48,890
I think there was a vote rigging. Uh, I,

1038
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:51,310
I assert and I will stand by this,

1039
00:58:51,311 --> 00:58:55,540
that voter fraud in this
country is nonexistent in
the way that the media would

1040
00:58:55,541 --> 00:58:57,070
make you wish that it existed.

1041
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:02,080
Pete poor people are not pitching up
in their millions to polling places and

1042
00:59:02,081 --> 00:59:05,350
trying to fob off bad idea or
whatever. And then, you know,

1043
00:59:05,351 --> 00:59:08,100
like a lot of states have Jen,
this whole voter id thing and people,

1044
00:59:08,110 --> 00:59:11,740
why shouldn't you have to show Id
let me hit you to something. Um,

1045
00:59:11,770 --> 00:59:15,070
about 10 to 15% of this
country has no money at all.

1046
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:19,240
And those people don't have bank accounts,
phones, televisions, computers or ideas.

1047
00:59:19,450 --> 00:59:23,150
Yeah, they're ad hoc doing that
shit. They don't just have it.

1048
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:26,300
And like for instance, I was on a
show in a conservative lady said,

1049
00:59:26,301 --> 00:59:28,160
why shouldn't people have show ids?
And I said,

1050
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:33,230
my mother who passed away this year was
94. I said, my mother doesn't have an ID.

1051
00:59:33,231 --> 00:59:35,960
She's voted in every election
since Roosevelt's first one.

1052
00:59:35,961 --> 00:59:38,750
Are you going to deny her the vote?
What do you do? How do you go?

1053
00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:41,750
You don't have to,
if you're on the voter roll,

1054
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:46,430
you come up and you say your name and
they've stayed on the role and I'm Greg

1055
00:59:46,430 --> 00:59:47,480
Proops. Yeah, but they,

1056
00:59:47,481 --> 00:59:51,330
you're not correct groups and you
don't know who's doing it. Do you check

1057
00:59:52,870 --> 00:59:55,250
that?
[inaudible] Woodland Hills.

1058
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:02,270
Greg Proops cut that part out. It's
too late. It's live. Oh Shit. Fuck,

1059
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:05,990
I'm sorry. Uh, anyways, the and
a woman said there was a plate,

1060
01:00:06,050 --> 01:00:10,130
a case in Illinois and shit. My,
my point is governments in actress,

1061
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:13,550
restrictive voter laws.
That's what's going on with voter fraud.

1062
01:00:14,150 --> 01:00:17,060
Making students not be allowed to vote
that are in North Carolina college

1063
01:00:17,061 --> 01:00:19,190
students not letting them
use their student Id to vote.

1064
01:00:19,370 --> 01:00:22,880
When you're living for two or three
years and you are an out of state student

1065
01:00:22,881 --> 01:00:27,140
living in North Carolina, you will now
not be able to use your voter id. You see,

1066
01:00:27,141 --> 01:00:30,680
that's a restrictive law. If you're
over 18 and you're registered to vote,

1067
01:00:30,681 --> 01:00:34,790
no matter what state you're in, ought to
be able to vote in the place that you,

1068
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,670
you know, that's just one
example, but I'm in like,

1069
01:00:37,750 --> 01:00:42,360
that's all bunch of liberal
Hooley is made of Liberal Hawaii.

1070
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:46,010
I live on a bale of Hay
made of Hooey for people.

1071
01:00:46,011 --> 01:00:50,180
Need to think about less putting less
money in your grill. Exactly, man.

1072
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:52,860
And more money in your ID collected.

1073
01:00:52,950 --> 01:00:55,700
We're going to let the cast of winter
bone vote, then I want to vote.

1074
01:00:55,730 --> 01:00:57,440
That's all I'm saying.
At a certain point in time,

1075
01:00:57,441 --> 01:00:59,270
it wasn't everyone gonna need id though.

1076
01:00:59,610 --> 01:01:02,990
It seems like it almost seems like
they're going to jail. I agree with you.

1077
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:07,160
And they do and everything that everything
that we possess has a code in it and

1078
01:01:07,161 --> 01:01:10,940
it can, your wallet and everything in
your wallet can be read from you know,

1079
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:12,620
miles away. Yeah. Yeah. And,

1080
01:01:12,621 --> 01:01:16,940
and all that shy because of the ID chips
that are in everything. And I'm like, Oh,

1081
01:01:16,941 --> 01:01:20,330
and your phone is on all the time.
We know this is just obvious shit now,

1082
01:01:20,331 --> 01:01:22,790
but my phone is a tracking
device. Right, right. But I,

1083
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:27,580
I'm telling you that people who, who
live day to day, uh, for instance,

1084
01:01:28,010 --> 01:01:30,410
if you see homeless people,
which you do in Los Angeles,

1085
01:01:30,590 --> 01:01:34,820
they don't have a cell phone and an
ID card. And you know what I mean?

1086
01:01:34,821 --> 01:01:38,960
Like that the idea that everyone has
a computer is a real white people

1087
01:01:38,961 --> 01:01:43,520
middleclass idea around the
world of the 5 billion of us.

1088
01:01:43,521 --> 01:01:45,350
I guarantee you it's not that many.

1089
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:49,670
It's not the majority of people with a
computer because there's lots of other

1090
01:01:49,671 --> 01:01:54,530
countries like unless you think every
single human in Africa has a computer,

1091
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:59,660
if you know what I'm saying. I mean
like most by now, if they don't,

1092
01:01:59,661 --> 01:02:02,390
I'd like them to subscribe to your thing.
I'm selling on my podcast.

1093
01:02:02,690 --> 01:02:07,190
It's pretty fascinating when you think
about how vast the differences between

1094
01:02:07,191 --> 01:02:10,430
the people in the poorest parts of the
world and the people in the richest parts

1095
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:11,264
of the world,

1096
01:02:11,270 --> 01:02:15,880
and the difference in what life is
and from the jump with no, you know,

1097
01:02:16,070 --> 01:02:20,070
you didn't do anything wrong. They just
got the worst hand of cards ever wound

1098
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:24,360
up in an incredibly poor country and
no one has shoes or something terrible

1099
01:02:24,361 --> 01:02:24,661
happened.

1100
01:02:24,661 --> 01:02:29,490
Like you're a middle class person
living in Syria or Iraq or whatever,

1101
01:02:29,491 --> 01:02:33,180
and all of a sudden the shit hits the
fan and now you have to move to a camp

1102
01:02:33,210 --> 01:02:36,660
cause your neighborhood got
blown to shit and fuck. You know,

1103
01:02:36,690 --> 01:02:39,840
there's a lot of different, speaking
of which can I plug my comedy special?

1104
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:42,570
Oh hell on this. Delightful, upbeat note.

1105
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:45,120
We were talking about people around
the world possessing computers.

1106
01:02:45,150 --> 01:02:47,530
If you do possess one,
you can download my comments.

1107
01:02:47,540 --> 01:02:49,930
If you're listening to this
and you don't have something,

1108
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,110
what could you do it on a phone?
Can you download it on a phone?

1109
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:55,130
I expect your kid. Yes. Then you
can even get it on your phone.

1110
01:02:55,131 --> 01:02:56,280
I'm just going to sit on your phone,

1111
01:02:56,490 --> 01:02:58,410
put it on your friend's phone
and then sit behind them.

1112
01:02:58,440 --> 01:02:59,460
If you're listening to this,

1113
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:02,730
it's impossible that you don't have
access to Greg Proops comedy special.

1114
01:03:03,060 --> 01:03:07,060
You can get it.
It's a chill.com/groups or uh,

1115
01:03:07,070 --> 01:03:11,460
Greg proops.com and a,
I think it's 509 I think it's for 80 now.

1116
01:03:11,490 --> 01:03:13,290
I think it goes up to five
99 when it comes down.

1117
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:16,080
I shot it lie that Musso and
Frank's, you know that joint. Oh,

1118
01:03:16,081 --> 01:03:19,190
that place in Hollywood. Oh,
that what an amazing idea.

1119
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:21,080
I didn't even know they did
shows that they down with.

1120
01:03:21,420 --> 01:03:25,230
My manager came to me and said, I've
got it loose. Hose is perfect for you.

1121
01:03:25,231 --> 01:03:27,810
And I was like, it is
perfect for me. So I say,

1122
01:03:27,811 --> 01:03:31,680
I say a bunch of quotes from
all the riders that drank
there, like Bukovsky said,

1123
01:03:31,681 --> 01:03:35,520
never get up before noon.
And uh, uh, what does it,

1124
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:38,670
Faulkner said a time.
Time is a time his dad,

1125
01:03:38,671 --> 01:03:40,410
as long as it's being clicked
off by a little wheels,

1126
01:03:40,411 --> 01:03:42,510
only when the clock stops does
time come alive. And I said,

1127
01:03:42,540 --> 01:03:47,540
Moose says is where the clock stops and
time comes alive because it's always the

1128
01:03:47,581 --> 01:03:52,190
past though. It feels like it, it looks
like it. You get that Vibe, you know?

1129
01:03:52,270 --> 01:03:55,320
And that place has been
around for a long time.

1130
01:03:55,390 --> 01:03:57,970
[inaudible] it's such a beautiful place.
Yeah.

1131
01:03:58,410 --> 01:04:00,810
I love those old Hollywood joints.

1132
01:04:00,811 --> 01:04:05,811
Like Dan to those places are amazing
cause it feels like when you go to them

1133
01:04:05,911 --> 01:04:10,560
that you're, you're like entering
into like, uh, like a time machine.

1134
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:15,660
You're going to a place that hasn't
changed much and so many years,

1135
01:04:15,690 --> 01:04:19,410
not even the menu of the smell bread,
they give you celery and shit.

1136
01:04:19,411 --> 01:04:23,130
You know what I'm saying? Like so good
stuff. Celery food is incredible too.

1137
01:04:23,131 --> 01:04:26,470
They have the best taken Hollywood
cause they don't fuck around. No, no.

1138
01:04:26,490 --> 01:04:28,890
It's really just steak and
know what they're doing.

1139
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:32,250
They know exactly how to cook it. Yeah.
And they always get the best meat.

1140
01:04:32,251 --> 01:04:34,140
Like they've been around forever.
They have these relationships.

1141
01:04:34,141 --> 01:04:38,310
Probably would butchers that go back to
the twenties oh everybody wears jackets,

1142
01:04:38,311 --> 01:04:42,390
man. It's insane. It's good. Yeah.
Those old joints are fucking amazing.

1143
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:45,840
There was so much fun to do it there
and we had a who sat down. It's no,

1144
01:04:45,870 --> 01:04:50,390
I saddled it for a little bit of it. Oh
yeah. Preview. Keep showing the preview.

1145
01:04:50,410 --> 01:04:53,250
Well done. Yeah. Yeah man. Yeah.

1146
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:56,100
I had a little table that I could
sit out and drank if I want it to.

1147
01:04:56,340 --> 01:04:59,960
But you walked around on the floor of
the restaurant? Yeah. And I had a band,

1148
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:04,620
CML jazz band behind man. Shit. What a
great idea. It was great fun. The areas.

1149
01:05:04,950 --> 01:05:08,910
What an original idea. Congratulations
man. It looks really nice.

1150
01:05:08,911 --> 01:05:12,780
They shot at really beautiful,
beautiful idea. I love it. Wow.

1151
01:05:12,870 --> 01:05:14,940
We just had a light and a
couple of cameras and uh,

1152
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:20,000
some smoke and we did on Sunday afternoon
and everybody could drink and uh,

1153
01:05:20,260 --> 01:05:24,190
people will a drink. That's awesome.
How many shows did you do? One or two?

1154
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:28,360
I did one with no hax why? I did like
two little things from another angle.

1155
01:05:28,361 --> 01:05:32,980
And that was that we struck like I
did an hour and then it was over.

1156
01:05:32,981 --> 01:05:34,180
So there was no,

1157
01:05:35,740 --> 01:05:40,600
he know there was no doing that Joko
or no fixing that or know anything.

1158
01:05:41,350 --> 01:05:45,880
Yeah. Alyssa, I believe me. I had a drink
and I just fucking kept him, you know,

1159
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:50,380
did it? Yeah, there's a lot
of like really great comics.

1160
01:05:50,381 --> 01:05:51,580
If you watch the specials,

1161
01:05:51,581 --> 01:05:56,470
you never got them at full bore because
he got like this sort of awkward version

1162
01:05:56,471 --> 01:05:56,861
of them.

1163
01:05:56,861 --> 01:06:01,861
Like the perfect example is a one
of Bill Hicks biggest specials.

1164
01:06:02,110 --> 01:06:05,410
He did it in London and
there was a huge crowd. Oh,

1165
01:06:05,411 --> 01:06:09,870
the one where it rides over the bridge
and it's on fire. Yeah, he's got like a

1166
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:16,420
Voodoo child rather, uh,
Jimi Hendrix. Uh, and he, uh,

1167
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:21,340
he's got a cowboy hat on holding. He
feels stiff to me. I mean, he's staging,

1168
01:06:21,700 --> 01:06:23,230
he feels like, you know, hey,

1169
01:06:23,231 --> 01:06:26,270
you got one shot at doing this
big special in this giant place.

1170
01:06:26,271 --> 01:06:29,440
He rides through hoops of fire into
the stage. I mean, it's pretty,

1171
01:06:29,450 --> 01:06:31,720
it was something along those lines,
right. It was something like that.

1172
01:06:31,810 --> 01:06:35,140
It was like that. He does come over the
London Bridge on a horse. I remember that.

1173
01:06:35,170 --> 01:06:36,370
That's hilarious.
No,

1174
01:06:36,371 --> 01:06:39,450
my friend Chris Bull directed that and
that was his whole concept form your,

1175
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:42,300
this warrior poet and you're accountable
and we're going to do this and they're

1176
01:06:42,301 --> 01:06:46,270
not, but I agree with you. It
puts a lot on, I much prefer to,

1177
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:49,420
Oh God,
it's going to ever show me myself.

1178
01:06:50,620 --> 01:06:54,770
I'm going to wear a fucking Jawa outfit.
Oh yeah.

1179
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:59,400
Um, I much preferred being able to just
stand on the floor of this restaurant.

1180
01:06:59,401 --> 01:07:03,640
You have a drink like, and it didn't feel
that pressure patch and I, it was all,

1181
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:06,190
you know,
friends and people have friends,

1182
01:07:06,191 --> 01:07:08,020
friends that sounds like you could drink.

1183
01:07:08,021 --> 01:07:09,790
It was Sunday afternoon and
everybody had a couple drinks.

1184
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:13,270
If there's so many of those little
cool spots like that in Hollywood,

1185
01:07:13,810 --> 01:07:16,360
you know the government is,
the comedy store of course is one of them.

1186
01:07:16,490 --> 01:07:20,200
The rainbow, the Rainbow
God, that place is so weird.

1187
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:24,190
That's like going back into it and
talking video or something. Man, that is,

1188
01:07:24,370 --> 01:07:28,230
and those people still go there
today? Yeah, it's their spot. Oh yeah,

1189
01:07:29,140 --> 01:07:32,650
the rainbow. That's so funny. I
forget what I was doing up there.

1190
01:07:32,651 --> 01:07:35,840
I was going to some show business
thing and I went in the rainbow too,

1191
01:07:35,870 --> 01:07:38,740
like how the beer and used the bathroom.
The food's good there too.

1192
01:07:38,770 --> 01:07:41,890
I did comedy there. These
are really, is it upstairs?

1193
01:07:43,330 --> 01:07:45,310
It's in the round where you have
to just kind of walk around.

1194
01:07:45,311 --> 01:07:49,810
There's people all around you. That's
hilarious. I did one bar on Hollywood.

1195
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:54,250
Was the red something or another that
used to be on sunset? What was it?

1196
01:07:54,251 --> 01:07:58,510
The Rand Red Room. No, no.
They just closed that place.

1197
01:07:58,540 --> 01:08:02,650
It was a weird place. It was like you're,
you are doing red, red rock. Yeah.

1198
01:08:02,651 --> 01:08:05,680
It was like you were doing comedy
in somebody's attic change.

1199
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:08,230
They just really felt like an attic.
They just reopened it.

1200
01:08:08,231 --> 01:08:11,710
And I guess they made that top part
bigger cause it's now it's a piano bar or

1201
01:08:11,711 --> 01:08:15,040
something weird like that. Holy Cow.
That's when you know comedies failed.

1202
01:08:15,830 --> 01:08:17,090
We lost to a piano bar.

1203
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:20,540
Howl at the moon when it's the
two Julian [inaudible] guys.

1204
01:08:20,550 --> 01:08:22,940
So Greg Proops stop it.
Hey that shit.

1205
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:26,600
Well that's one of the beautiful
things about the attitude in Texas.

1206
01:08:26,850 --> 01:08:29,450
Prov Addison, Texas. It's
right next door to it. Yep.

1207
01:08:29,570 --> 01:08:32,840
So dudes would come out of there, you'd
be lit up and you're like, come on man,

1208
01:08:32,990 --> 01:08:36,590
let's go play some fucking piano.
Woo.

1209
01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:41,030
And then people would be singing back
and forth and dueling Pittsburgh.

1210
01:08:41,990 --> 01:08:45,320
It's in a mall. The other bar
there is the hell with the men.

1211
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:47,330
I think the last time I played there,
I got an email.

1212
01:08:47,331 --> 01:08:50,770
You get denied or late cause you got
to do the radio the next day and like

1213
01:08:51,530 --> 01:08:53,270
there's nothing around but that.

1214
01:08:53,271 --> 01:08:57,320
So I went there and had a
few drinks and get lit up.

1215
01:08:58,250 --> 01:09:00,770
Oh yeah. Because after you're there
for a while, you're just like,

1216
01:09:00,950 --> 01:09:05,950
who sadder did people that are here or
me because I'm here and I had to do this,

1217
01:09:07,221 --> 01:09:11,120
you know, one man. Nothing sad about
it. Just get it to be wherever you are.

1218
01:09:11,121 --> 01:09:15,920
There you be. Well, I was, I had a few
drinks. So you're at Howl at the moon,

1219
01:09:16,130 --> 01:09:20,240
taking an experience, having a
little alcohol, little person dipper,

1220
01:09:20,730 --> 01:09:23,060
some jams that I hadn't heard in a while.
There you go.

1221
01:09:23,180 --> 01:09:26,510
Little awesome old Leonard Skinner
do something like that. Yeah. Yeah.

1222
01:09:26,511 --> 01:09:30,650
Those places are despicable.
They should be stopped. It's,

1223
01:09:30,860 --> 01:09:34,580
it's kind of a weird, I don't
understand. Like, well, I mean, yeah,

1224
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:38,150
I don't know that they're fine. It's fun,
right? It's fun for people. I get it.

1225
01:09:38,151 --> 01:09:40,550
The people want to have fun it.
But as I always say on my show,

1226
01:09:40,551 --> 01:09:43,280
I'm sure to shit on something you
love, so, but you know what man?

1227
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:46,720
Like it's like you said, it's good
to see all kinds of stuff. And I,

1228
01:09:46,721 --> 01:09:49,160
I personally like some country western,
you know,

1229
01:09:49,161 --> 01:09:53,090
even silly stuff like Toby Keith.
Yeah. I like some Toby Keith songs.

1230
01:09:53,390 --> 01:09:57,230
I think they're good. You know, I don't,
I know they're silly lyrics. I don't care.

1231
01:09:57,290 --> 01:10:00,710
I think they're good. It's
doesn't bother me. I enjoy it.

1232
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:02,690
I enjoy a lot of shit.

1233
01:10:03,140 --> 01:10:06,980
I can put myself in a lot of different
mindsets for a Goof, you know?

1234
01:10:07,070 --> 01:10:11,240
Did you get my, at least in city yet?
Oh Dude. It's the best Jagger ever done.

1235
01:10:11,241 --> 01:10:15,020
Bangers. Bangers, bangers. No,

1236
01:10:16,070 --> 01:10:20,540
I heard it's doing really well though.
Don't ask me how. I know her care.

1237
01:10:21,020 --> 01:10:23,630
Britney Spears isn't it? And I'm
the music, but she's in it. Yeah.

1238
01:10:23,631 --> 01:10:28,460
She does a song with her. Wow. It's really
cool. You really doubling down. Yeah.

1239
01:10:29,110 --> 01:10:30,860
That's about a journey's
greatest hits whizzes.

1240
01:10:30,870 --> 01:10:33,430
I highly recommend that to
journey's greatest hits.

1241
01:10:33,431 --> 01:10:37,090
Do Journey has some strong songs.
A lot of people don't want a minute.

1242
01:10:38,030 --> 01:10:39,500
It's a lot of people
don't want to admit it,

1243
01:10:39,530 --> 01:10:43,220
but journey had some fucking strong
songs that if you're by yourself,

1244
01:10:43,221 --> 01:10:47,510
you'd get pretty excited if it came on
the radio. No one doesn't admit it yet.

1245
01:10:47,540 --> 01:10:51,090
That fucking just a small town scow.
Yeah.

1246
01:10:51,710 --> 01:10:52,820
Dominated the world.

1247
01:10:53,180 --> 01:10:56,840
So much so that I was in
Nashville like a year ago.

1248
01:10:57,170 --> 01:10:58,140
And you know how there's that,

1249
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:01,370
what's the name of the main drag in
national where all the country bars are?

1250
01:11:01,371 --> 01:11:03,830
Whatever. And uh, uh, you know,

1251
01:11:03,831 --> 01:11:07,160
we were drinking up and down the street
after the show and we went to a country

1252
01:11:07,161 --> 01:11:09,050
bar where it was like country open Mike.

1253
01:11:09,290 --> 01:11:13,450
So there was the sexy dude who had the
leather vest and he sang the Charlie

1254
01:11:13,450 --> 01:11:13,980
Daniels and wanting to,

1255
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:18,690
you just leave this long haired contract
ball, right. And then every, you know,

1256
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:21,330
every type of open Mike country.
And then there was a band that got up.

1257
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:25,680
Then this girl got up this blonde girl
and she fucking sang journey and you're

1258
01:11:25,681 --> 01:11:29,360
like, we're in Nashville.
And the place lit up man. And
I was like, Shit. She went,

1259
01:11:29,790 --> 01:11:32,730
he's Jeff for small town square out
of the whole place. Like fucking

1260
01:11:33,430 --> 01:11:37,660
thought, you know, fuck
yeah. Yeah. Who's crying now?

1261
01:11:37,780 --> 01:11:42,520
That's a great song. That's
a great fucking song. If
you by yourself, you will,

1262
01:11:42,521 --> 01:11:44,260
you will get very excited
when that song comes on.

1263
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:47,950
If you run a bunch of checks that
you, you know, if they know you,

1264
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:50,380
you're going to let them know
the enjoy a little journey. Yeah.

1265
01:11:50,530 --> 01:11:55,240
That's when my new guilty pleasure
events people judge you on.

1266
01:11:55,270 --> 01:11:58,390
Yeah. Oh yeah, they do judge you
like my friend Joey, Joey Diaz,

1267
01:11:58,420 --> 01:12:01,780
he gets really mad at Eddie Bravo
for Eddie Bravo loving kiss.

1268
01:12:02,770 --> 01:12:06,290
And I've told them a mug. I'm
sorry dude. I love some case. Yeah,

1269
01:12:06,330 --> 01:12:09,640
you're fucking 45 years old, Joe Robbing
Mother fucking listening to that Shit.

1270
01:12:10,250 --> 01:12:11,650
Fuck you.
Listen to that shit.

1271
01:12:11,740 --> 01:12:15,400
You're telling me it's one of the
greatest albums of all time. Suck my Dick.

1272
01:12:15,870 --> 01:12:20,140
And he'll just, he just goes off. You
can't enjoy, you cannot end. Never.

1273
01:12:20,141 --> 01:12:22,690
No one ever said it was the greatest
album of all time. No, no, no.

1274
01:12:22,691 --> 01:12:25,690
You can't enjoy it. You can. I
want to rock and roll all night is

1275
01:12:27,550 --> 01:12:31,240
magnum magnum opus. Yeah.
Yeah. That's a fucking great.

1276
01:12:31,241 --> 01:12:33,900
So Detroit rock city is
a fucking great sunshine.

1277
01:12:34,780 --> 01:12:39,620
I saw them a long time ago and uh, in
the 70s and the night hours died and uh,

1278
01:12:40,900 --> 01:12:45,190
that was pretty weird. How old
were you? 16. 17 I think. Um,

1279
01:12:45,790 --> 01:12:50,400
that he died on my sister's
birthday. And uh, Elvis did. Yeah,

1280
01:12:52,810 --> 01:12:54,670
everybody died that year, wasn't it? 77.

1281
01:12:55,510 --> 01:12:59,290
Because I think being an Chaplin died that
year too. Big Year real business. Yeah.

1282
01:12:59,980 --> 01:13:04,570
Wow. Yeah. But I went to see kiss,
I've told this story before, but the,

1283
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:05,470
at the end,

1284
01:13:05,860 --> 01:13:08,680
Dave and screaming all night and they
spit blood and they spit fire and they're

1285
01:13:08,681 --> 01:13:11,410
on platforms like grain
elevators and shit. And you know,

1286
01:13:11,411 --> 01:13:15,280
they did all their numbers and they did
Detroit Bucks and I sold a joint to a 10

1287
01:13:15,281 --> 01:13:19,720
year old and yeah, fuck you
man. And gangster back. Oh Dude.

1288
01:13:19,770 --> 01:13:22,720
I that's why, that's how I roll. And uh,

1289
01:13:23,590 --> 01:13:26,250
we drove up from San Carlos
to the cow palace in, uh,

1290
01:13:26,930 --> 01:13:29,800
I remember at the end of the show,
gene Simmons goes

1291
01:13:36,730 --> 01:13:39,010
badly and then they did gel.
That might be the worst.

1292
01:13:39,190 --> 01:13:41,850
She's him and compression the world
has ever known. I can't do him.

1293
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:46,510
Maybe it was Paul to someone's
house, a divorce. Well those screens,

1294
01:13:46,660 --> 01:13:49,270
everything they would say, maybe
it was Paul then, cause Paul does.

1295
01:13:49,271 --> 01:13:53,030
That's probably Paul. And anyways, they
played jailhouse rock but like kids,

1296
01:13:53,031 --> 01:13:55,970
so it was like, oh, Whoa, oh,

1297
01:13:59,190 --> 01:13:59,310
you

1298
01:13:59,310 --> 01:14:02,950
know. Right. You know, like they
didn't like pep up the beat.

1299
01:14:03,580 --> 01:14:07,240
And I remember turning to my friend in
the depths of my drunkenness and weed

1300
01:14:07,241 --> 01:14:10,390
drank like a jug. And those days you used
to bring plastic jugs full of odd kit.

1301
01:14:10,420 --> 01:14:13,690
Right. It could a plastic jug in
and if it had lemonade, you know,

1302
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:19,300
we didn't have sports bottles, we
had plastic jugs. Remember? Yeah.

1303
01:14:19,301 --> 01:14:22,180
I remember those. And
um, so like, uh, yeah,

1304
01:14:22,270 --> 01:14:24,220
even in the depths of my
degradation at that point,

1305
01:14:24,221 --> 01:14:28,420
having sold weed to a child and was
pretty drunk, I, uh, turned him in.

1306
01:14:28,421 --> 01:14:32,590
And why are they playing chess rock?
Yeah. And then the next morning,

1307
01:14:32,591 --> 01:14:35,920
of course Elvis dies at 44 or whatever.

1308
01:14:36,260 --> 01:14:40,250
It would have been pretty bad ass if
they did it like in a totally different

1309
01:14:40,251 --> 01:14:40,950
musical styles.

1310
01:14:40,950 --> 01:14:45,000
Right. Then their own, yeah. Yeah.
If they did it like, well, two Pi,

1311
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:50,360
they really did it. I liked the
ability to shut up. Wow. No,

1312
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:55,290
no. They did kiss. It was
like God offender. If,

1313
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:56,810
if that works with Joe House wrong,

1314
01:14:56,870 --> 01:14:59,520
don't, don't, don't, don't, don't,
that's another good song. Yeah.

1315
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:04,950
Fuck you Joey Diaz. How dare
you. They're not the best crowd.

1316
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:08,330
Listen man,
I don't think there is the best group,

1317
01:15:08,660 --> 01:15:13,550
but I think there's sometimes where kisses
the best group cause that's what you

1318
01:15:13,551 --> 01:15:16,430
want to hear at that moment.
That might be chill sometimes I just like,

1319
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:19,820
I'm looking through my iPod and I'm like,
Yay, let's listen to a little of this.

1320
01:15:20,150 --> 01:15:22,820
And then there's sometimes it's the
stones and then sometimes it's something

1321
01:15:22,821 --> 01:15:23,270
else.

1322
01:15:23,270 --> 01:15:26,990
We'll play a little group called
Whitesnake doing here I go again.

1323
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:31,690
I've told the story many times but I'll
tell it again. I was in a car accident.

1324
01:15:31,691 --> 01:15:34,420
This was when I was 21.
I had this girlfriend is 25,

1325
01:15:34,421 --> 01:15:38,170
but she's telling me what to do.
She was so hot though. Um, but we,

1326
01:15:38,171 --> 01:15:40,080
we got in a car accident and um,

1327
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:43,060
I was pulling out the stuff from my
car cause he had it towed my car away.

1328
01:15:43,410 --> 01:15:45,310
Some dude ran the light
and smashed into me

1329
01:15:46,810 --> 01:15:50,800
and she made me throw out my Whitesnake.
She was like,

1330
01:15:50,801 --> 01:15:54,580
why do you still have this throw
this way? And I was like, what?

1331
01:15:55,690 --> 01:15:56,680
Hey Rocco.

1332
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:12,420
And then tiny kitchen put
your thing in your face.

1333
01:16:12,460 --> 01:16:16,210
She was my drug dealer though.
Really? Well she had pussy. Yeah,

1334
01:16:16,390 --> 01:16:19,710
that was my drug dealer. Yeah. She
was my drug dealer when I was 21 plus.

1335
01:16:19,711 --> 01:16:22,500
He was the gray, the greatest
drug of all time. I did.

1336
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:25,780
It took me a while to understand
like why we want bound up in these

1337
01:16:26,230 --> 01:16:29,500
relationships where people would just
like be completely unreasonable and we

1338
01:16:29,530 --> 01:16:31,420
wouldn't get along at
all. And I realized, Oh,

1339
01:16:31,421 --> 01:16:34,830
I'm like a druggy druggy for putting,
there's something at the end of this.

1340
01:16:35,170 --> 01:16:37,950
This is like,
this is not like a relationship where you,

1341
01:16:37,990 --> 01:16:40,930
this is the type of person or the
person that you want to be with.

1342
01:16:41,110 --> 01:16:43,810
This is the person you can tolerate
because you guys like to fuck each other.

1343
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:47,590
Yeah. It's not healthy. It's
not a good way to go about it.

1344
01:16:48,230 --> 01:16:52,940
Well, it's short term, not the long game.

1345
01:16:53,570 --> 01:16:54,680
The long game

1346
01:16:55,690 --> 01:16:58,540
to avoid argument at all costs.
Greg proof.

1347
01:16:58,860 --> 01:17:01,920
Nah Man. And it's something that
you never learned. That's horrible.

1348
01:17:01,921 --> 01:17:03,480
Stay off the Moore's.
Yep.

1349
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:07,730
Stick to the road now she
kept it dealt with. It's a,

1350
01:17:07,820 --> 01:17:12,200
the point is why I have to
feel like I'm right. You don't.

1351
01:17:12,230 --> 01:17:15,860
If you didn't then real all
relationships would be smooth sailing

1352
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:19,680
sometimes. Sometimes people just
have fucking hormonal swings.

1353
01:17:19,980 --> 01:17:23,160
Sometimes people just have weird
career paths and their life,

1354
01:17:23,161 --> 01:17:26,490
like it's weird dating someone who's going
through a real rough spot in a career.

1355
01:17:26,491 --> 01:17:31,491
Like I never realized how women get so
much more emotional about like work kind

1356
01:17:32,581 --> 01:17:36,180
of stuff. Then my guy friends
did like when I was dating,

1357
01:17:36,181 --> 01:17:40,490
I was dating this girl and she was having
a hard time whether a her job and you

1358
01:17:40,491 --> 01:17:43,500
know she, her career was
kind of in shambles and she,

1359
01:17:43,501 --> 01:17:46,200
the way she was looking
at it was so emotional.

1360
01:17:46,201 --> 01:17:50,250
It cry and this isn't working
and what am I going to do?

1361
01:17:50,610 --> 01:17:53,700
Whereas if it was one of my guy
friends, they'd be like, dude,

1362
01:17:54,180 --> 01:17:57,810
I'm getting fucking fire. Right?
Like this sucks. I think I'm a,

1363
01:17:57,811 --> 01:18:00,750
I'm thinking about doing this. I might
be doing that. And my uncle knows this.

1364
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:04,340
I told him, I told my brother and he told
me, you know, there's, there's a plan,

1365
01:18:04,410 --> 01:18:09,300
there's some shit in motion, there's
get going. Whereas like for some women,

1366
01:18:09,301 --> 01:18:14,301
the struggle of like dealing with like
personal failures are dealing with um,

1367
01:18:16,340 --> 01:18:18,780
work type failures,
tapper,

1368
01:18:19,830 --> 01:18:21,750
super impactful.

1369
01:18:22,140 --> 01:18:25,850
And I think that's a weird thing for guys
to wrap their heads around it. And, and,

1370
01:18:25,860 --> 01:18:29,370
and I'm not discounting the fact that a
lot of guys have a lot of like big time

1371
01:18:29,371 --> 01:18:32,790
emotional connections with
things that go wrong at work too.

1372
01:18:32,791 --> 01:18:34,590
But I've never seen it
from my guy friends.

1373
01:18:34,830 --> 01:18:36,540
Like I had seen it from
girls that I dated.

1374
01:18:36,630 --> 01:18:38,550
Well, if you want to come to
my house, I'll cry in front of

1375
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:39,733
my career.

1376
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:45,560
I try to limit it to the car, you know,
it's your podcast doing well. Yeah.

1377
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:50,060
Thank you. It's a great podcast. Thank
you very much. Really Fun and very unique

1378
01:18:50,070 --> 01:18:53,430
to explain to people how you do it
because you do it differently than pretty

1379
01:18:53,431 --> 01:18:54,060
much anyone.

1380
01:18:54,060 --> 01:18:56,860
Well, I don't use humor
in mind per se. Uh,

1381
01:18:56,861 --> 01:19:01,350
I invite people to waste up to two hours
of their life listening to me talk and

1382
01:19:01,351 --> 01:19:04,110
drone on and on about
should I have no business.

1383
01:19:04,470 --> 01:19:07,140
I sit in front of a live crowd and uh,

1384
01:19:07,830 --> 01:19:11,190
and just spiel basically for the
first like half hour, 45 minutes.

1385
01:19:11,191 --> 01:19:12,750
And then I kind of get to the second part,

1386
01:19:12,751 --> 01:19:16,200
which is the boring preachy part and
that's when it's about the news and the

1387
01:19:16,201 --> 01:19:17,100
government and whatever.

1388
01:19:17,101 --> 01:19:21,480
And I often have the Bible
of the Constitution Handy
and I'll read little parts

1389
01:19:21,481 --> 01:19:25,490
of it out just to make sure people are
down with the letter of the law. And um,

1390
01:19:26,090 --> 01:19:28,130
how do people react to that?
Do you find the,

1391
01:19:28,131 --> 01:19:31,820
you're getting mostly people who know
what you're doing and know what to expect

1392
01:19:31,821 --> 01:19:35,000
or do you get a lot of people that are
kind of surprised because they thought it

1393
01:19:35,001 --> 01:19:38,600
was like a comedy podcast or they thought
you were just going to do stand up?

1394
01:19:38,660 --> 01:19:40,960
Well, that's so interesting that other
guy that was saying that's silly,

1395
01:19:41,310 --> 01:19:44,790
right? Like, I think at the beginning, um,

1396
01:19:44,850 --> 01:19:47,970
the people that didn't like it listened
to it once and that was it for them.

1397
01:19:47,971 --> 01:19:52,320
You know what I mean? Like, Eh, you know,
the first couple of months I did it,

1398
01:19:52,470 --> 01:19:56,070
I think all the people who thought I
was the cute funny one from who's line,

1399
01:19:56,071 --> 01:19:58,800
like he's going to be that way and then,
oh wait,

1400
01:19:58,830 --> 01:20:02,130
he's poisoned about this and he thinks
about this and he cares about that and I

1401
01:20:02,131 --> 01:20:04,290
don't want to dot.
I think they just appeared early.

1402
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:09,180
And what I've found is sometimes
I think as an interminable leak,

1403
01:20:09,510 --> 01:20:12,900
you know, just a Sufi
desert, devoid of humor.

1404
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:16,410
Just my opinion for ever and ever is the
part that people really liked because I

1405
01:20:16,411 --> 01:20:18,240
think people want you to beat yourself,
like you said.

1406
01:20:18,241 --> 01:20:21,420
And that's really the closest
to being myself as a comedian,

1407
01:20:21,421 --> 01:20:23,640
that I've ever been
even more than stand up,

1408
01:20:23,641 --> 01:20:27,540
which I always thought was the most direct
way I think the podcast is, you know,

1409
01:20:27,541 --> 01:20:29,650
cause it's from the heart
and I don't think about what,

1410
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:33,940
I mean I put some stuff together,
but I don't write anything, you know?

1411
01:20:34,410 --> 01:20:36,540
And then whatever stories I tell,
it's like on the night,

1412
01:20:36,541 --> 01:20:39,300
I think it's something that something
spurred onto me or usually it's about

1413
01:20:39,301 --> 01:20:43,260
where I am or what time I was there before
or something that happened that day.

1414
01:20:43,261 --> 01:20:46,140
Or, you know, like you said, there's
always something to talk about.

1415
01:20:46,141 --> 01:20:49,350
And so that's how I kind of do it. And
then I take questions at the end, uh,

1416
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:53,350
on the road. I always take questions
at the end and we just hash it around.

1417
01:20:53,351 --> 01:20:56,370
And some, there's been a couple
of that. The, the public, uh,

1418
01:20:56,371 --> 01:20:59,700
the public that the people who listened
to it sort of came up with, like,

1419
01:21:00,540 --> 01:21:02,140
I never started it,
but someone said, well,

1420
01:21:02,150 --> 01:21:05,160
who's your all time baseball team
of Roman emperors be? Or whatever.

1421
01:21:05,161 --> 01:21:08,400
So I made one up, right. And then
the next time someone goes, well,

1422
01:21:08,401 --> 01:21:11,220
who would the king and Queens of England
Bay, who had your chief justices be?

1423
01:21:11,220 --> 01:21:14,100
He would the president's be who
had the greatest women in history.

1424
01:21:14,101 --> 01:21:18,090
So I have all these different teams that
we've done over the years and I just

1425
01:21:18,091 --> 01:21:19,590
make them up in the
moment. I don't, you know,

1426
01:21:19,591 --> 01:21:22,140
sometimes I fuck him up cause you know,

1427
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:25,650
I'm high and I'm trying to think
of a whole bunch of shit at once.

1428
01:21:25,651 --> 01:21:27,540
And I mean I remember in London my,

1429
01:21:27,690 --> 01:21:30,390
they said kings and Queens of England
and I went through it and my English

1430
01:21:30,391 --> 01:21:33,390
friends up came up to me. We went,
wow, I thought you're going to,

1431
01:21:33,870 --> 01:21:36,330
I was worried about you there. And
I'm like, fuck you. I know. No,

1432
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:40,020
I know enough kings and Queens of England
to make a baseball team out of them.

1433
01:21:40,021 --> 01:21:42,900
You know, you're supposedly, it's
supposed to be funny, you know,

1434
01:21:42,901 --> 01:21:46,680
like the Roman emperor when I remember
it because I said a calendula behind the

1435
01:21:46,681 --> 01:21:49,590
plate because he can
handle balls and you know,

1436
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:54,180
but there's more salient ones than that.
Can you do?

1437
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:55,440
But I didn't make that up.

1438
01:21:55,470 --> 01:21:58,320
And then I talk about Negro Leagues and
Satchel Paige a lot and that became the

1439
01:21:58,321 --> 01:22:01,350
thing on the show.
Like people who hate baseball,

1440
01:22:01,410 --> 01:22:05,160
hate sports and don't even know what the
Negro Leagues are. Write me now and go,

1441
01:22:05,190 --> 01:22:08,160
it's interesting when you talk about
it, because I liked the talk. You know,

1442
01:22:08,550 --> 01:22:09,750
you know when you're passionate about,

1443
01:22:09,780 --> 01:22:12,480
you know when you like something
and you imbue that with enthusiasm,

1444
01:22:12,870 --> 01:22:16,860
not like hashing through that same bit
that you've done 4,000 times in the clubs

1445
01:22:16,861 --> 01:22:19,210
and you're just like, oh fuck,
here's the closer, you know,

1446
01:22:19,620 --> 01:22:22,470
there's none of that feeling to that.
What we're going to ask me, I'm sorry,

1447
01:22:22,550 --> 01:22:23,040
I don't know nothing.

1448
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:26,940
I just wondered if you could do Bob
the builder in an erotic situation. No,

1449
01:22:26,941 --> 01:22:29,610
I wouldn't do that, but
a, I loved Bob too much,

1450
01:22:29,611 --> 01:22:33,420
but I would say that Wendy was
exactly like Bob, but with earrings,

1451
01:22:33,480 --> 01:22:35,760
let me just put it that way.
I think that we're lesbians.

1452
01:22:35,761 --> 01:22:38,430
That's weird that you did that.
I never, never knew you did that.

1453
01:22:38,580 --> 01:22:41,090
That's a huge franchise.
Do you get it?

1454
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:46,200
Was Bob the builder cartoon for a Stop
Action Animation for children under four?

1455
01:22:47,790 --> 01:22:50,710
Basically, it's, I think two to two
and three year olds. Really? Yeah,

1456
01:22:50,890 --> 01:22:55,710
my nieces and nephews and he,
he lives in, uh, England and,

1457
01:22:56,580 --> 01:23:01,170
uh, the production, I haven't
done it for a few years, but
he used to do it. And, uh,

1458
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:06,670
I was the American voice,
the North American voice,
Canada and America. And, uh,

1459
01:23:06,810 --> 01:23:10,990
it, it's, uh, it's supposed to teach you
to reuse and recycle and shit like that.

1460
01:23:11,170 --> 01:23:14,640
Oh, there he is. He wears a
little belt and whatnot. And uh,

1461
01:23:14,690 --> 01:23:18,790
look at you because you're so
adorable. Bob. The builder.

1462
01:23:18,820 --> 01:23:23,680
Can we build it Bob the builder? Yes,
we can. And then like, he would go,

1463
01:23:23,681 --> 01:23:27,640
uh, English when he lived
in a caravan and drank tea,

1464
01:23:27,670 --> 01:23:32,060
but in the American when he lives in
a trailer and drinks coffee. So, wow.

1465
01:23:32,110 --> 01:23:35,500
We had to translate it into American
and it would be like, you know,

1466
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:38,920
they were going to build a road
somewhere and there was a bird's nest.

1467
01:23:38,921 --> 01:23:41,560
So what do we do about the bird?
You know they're little,

1468
01:23:41,561 --> 01:23:44,950
little short vignettes and there was a
couple of feature films too that were

1469
01:23:44,951 --> 01:23:49,390
kind of funny like Westerns and stuff and,
and all those characters have names.

1470
01:23:49,391 --> 01:23:54,391
They're all called like scape and muck
and whatnot and Mackay and never been

1471
01:23:55,210 --> 01:23:59,470
adequately scrambler you ever been at a
place like ordering something and a kid

1472
01:23:59,471 --> 01:24:04,360
go mr you Bob the builder and they always
pant like that right before they say

1473
01:24:04,361 --> 01:24:07,900
it to you, they're going to say, I can't
believe I heard your voice. I know,

1474
01:24:07,901 --> 01:24:10,510
but parents too,
parents will be watching this.

1475
01:24:10,540 --> 01:24:13,420
Parents will be watching Bob the boat
with their kids and all of a sudden they

1476
01:24:13,421 --> 01:24:17,490
tweet really,
really cause on my,

1477
01:24:17,530 --> 01:24:21,580
on my show it's smoke dope and drink
and you know, take drugs and do that.

1478
01:24:21,580 --> 01:24:24,970
And then they like, but then I don't
think it's that big of a dichotomy.

1479
01:24:24,971 --> 01:24:26,400
I mean it's for little kids,

1480
01:24:26,410 --> 01:24:30,400
why shouldn't I be a role model for
two year olds is swollen like speedy,

1481
01:24:30,401 --> 01:24:34,930
skip that one, let's call it once
again, it's, you know, little kids,

1482
01:24:35,680 --> 01:24:39,880
little kids cause someone's going to
pull, those are toxins. Shit like,

1483
01:24:40,630 --> 01:24:42,070
you know,
like cute.

1484
01:24:42,340 --> 01:24:47,340
I loved it because we would fly to
London and recorded in Soho and we would

1485
01:24:48,641 --> 01:24:53,070
order out. And I always, Scott Curry or
Chinese food, I mean like I love the Gig.

1486
01:24:53,071 --> 01:24:56,320
It was such,
there's a bar Italia on Dean street out.

1487
01:24:56,321 --> 01:24:59,560
Go there and have an espresso before
and then I'd go over and record.

1488
01:24:59,561 --> 01:25:03,860
And it was like, it was fun. It
was just fun. And the voices,

1489
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:06,490
this voice show the storable
apart and went into the audition.

1490
01:25:06,730 --> 01:25:08,140
If I've told this before,
I'm sorry,

1491
01:25:08,580 --> 01:25:12,280
I went to the audition in London and I
was reading and I did all these funny

1492
01:25:12,281 --> 01:25:14,620
voices, you know, Oh,
this and that whatnot.

1493
01:25:15,070 --> 01:25:19,680
And a English person comes on over
the, you know, inner common cause,

1494
01:25:20,840 --> 01:25:25,300
uh, Greg, could you, uh, would it be
all right if you're just a jewel voice?

1495
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:31,300
And I said, are you insinuating I
have a car 10 place? And uh, she went,

1496
01:25:31,301 --> 01:25:35,270
well, what did you try it one time?
So I went like, Oh, good for you,

1497
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:40,210
Andy recycled. And then they
were like, perfect. Loved it.

1498
01:25:40,420 --> 01:25:43,210
They gave me the job right there. Wow.
That's never happened to me before.

1499
01:25:43,211 --> 01:25:47,670
Since with any job and do it in your
own voice the way I'm speaking to you.

1500
01:25:47,910 --> 01:25:52,120
It would Joe Rogan. Well, you're a
famous, you live out here in this place.

1501
01:25:52,121 --> 01:25:53,980
It's so nice here in Sunflower Valley.

1502
01:25:54,220 --> 01:25:58,000
You're famous enough comedian that I'm
sure they know exactly what you talked

1503
01:25:58,001 --> 01:26:01,570
like when they brought you in. I
think that was it. I said, listen,

1504
01:26:01,571 --> 01:26:03,980
let's be perfect, Greg.
Being Greg proven, I

1505
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:07,700
spent 10 minutes doing other
ways at them going like, oh,

1506
01:26:07,701 --> 01:26:09,680
this isn't working out until one of them

1507
01:26:09,780 --> 01:26:14,550
came on and said they go, would you
like to do it in the studio? And I went,

1508
01:26:14,750 --> 01:26:18,700
ah yeah, I would. That'd be
really fun. So I ran out right

1509
01:26:18,740 --> 01:26:23,320
siding called my voice agent in London
and wet like fucking call them back right

1510
01:26:23,370 --> 01:26:25,840
now. You know what I mean though,
right. Let them think about it.

1511
01:26:25,841 --> 01:26:30,040
Don't let them get a Canadian. And I would
love to do voices. That was a fun one.

1512
01:26:30,041 --> 01:26:32,080
That lasted about three or
four years till they sold.

1513
01:26:32,380 --> 01:26:33,790
And this is what happens in show business.

1514
01:26:33,791 --> 01:26:36,700
This is a lot of Canadians on here
out there. It was hell yeah. Oh yeah.

1515
01:26:36,740 --> 01:26:39,040
Oh happy Canadian thanksgiving
by the way. Thank you. Oh,

1516
01:26:39,041 --> 01:26:42,380
powerful Canadian thanksgiving.
It is a very powerful and uh,

1517
01:26:42,490 --> 01:26:43,900
interchangeable Columbus Day of it.

1518
01:26:43,901 --> 01:26:47,380
Only because sometimes this is
the 12 sometimes it's Jane. Oh,

1519
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:51,220
so today is or isn't. It is, it is,
but you know how this one's fluid,

1520
01:26:51,221 --> 01:26:54,710
like President Day, you know kids don't
get that off school anymore. No, no.

1521
01:26:54,711 --> 01:26:56,970
Funny when we were talking about it today,
like yeah,

1522
01:26:57,130 --> 01:26:59,190
cause they realize Columbus was
kind of a mass murderer. Right?

1523
01:26:59,290 --> 01:27:03,790
No holidays changed more in ethos from
the time we were a little to now. Well,

1524
01:27:03,791 --> 01:27:08,560
like Santa Claus didn't become a fucking
housebreaking know sexual violator.

1525
01:27:09,010 --> 01:27:09,870
Yeah,
you're right.

1526
01:27:09,910 --> 01:27:14,910
Like first it was Columbus discovered
America with those Santa Maria and the

1527
01:27:15,100 --> 01:27:18,130
Pinto Nina. And then it was, oh,
he never really got to America.

1528
01:27:18,131 --> 01:27:20,700
He was in The Bahamas or some shit.
And then it got to,

1529
01:27:20,720 --> 01:27:25,720
he's a murderer and just dashing babies'
heads on rocks and you hear the stories

1530
01:27:25,941 --> 01:27:30,610
of the year and they would force
people to get, bring them back gold.

1531
01:27:30,611 --> 01:27:33,580
And they would have to bring whatever
they weighed and gold every week.

1532
01:27:33,581 --> 01:27:35,920
And if they didn't, they'd cut
one of their arms off. Oh yeah.

1533
01:27:35,980 --> 01:27:37,420
So they do it to a couple people.

1534
01:27:37,421 --> 01:27:39,280
They cut their arm off
and everyone's screaming.

1535
01:27:39,490 --> 01:27:43,680
And so the rest of them just scramble
and go and get that gold. Like they,

1536
01:27:43,681 --> 01:27:46,960
they there. Do you remember the last
time I was on, we talked about Columbus,

1537
01:27:46,961 --> 01:27:49,840
cause you called them the new
original gangster. He really was.

1538
01:27:49,960 --> 01:27:54,150
Well I think everybody was gangster back
then. You know, the crown couldn't, yeah.

1539
01:27:54,151 --> 01:27:54,984
Wait,

1540
01:27:55,070 --> 01:27:58,700
it was when he got back after the
first one, it took a long time.

1541
01:27:58,730 --> 01:28:00,140
The other guy who hated him,

1542
01:28:00,190 --> 01:28:04,760
it was also co captain or the expedition
died for much to his good fortune.

1543
01:28:04,761 --> 01:28:08,020
He was in another boat. He
was in the Nina and uh, oh,

1544
01:28:08,380 --> 01:28:10,610
so Columbus got back after much ado.
Yeah.

1545
01:28:10,620 --> 01:28:13,580
You've got your Portugal almost crashed,
landed the whole fucking enchilada.

1546
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:16,190
When he finally got to
Ferdinand and Isabella,

1547
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:20,210
he had enough stuff with them from
that first journey. And by the way,

1548
01:28:20,211 --> 01:28:21,380
he left like 40 guys there.

1549
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:24,650
Cause th the Santa Maria ran a
ground and it was fucking scuppered.

1550
01:28:24,860 --> 01:28:28,430
So he just left a bunch of fucking
guys in the Caribbean and they died.

1551
01:28:28,460 --> 01:28:31,760
They got in fights with the Indians
and died when he got back to Spain and

1552
01:28:31,761 --> 01:28:35,990
finally, finally got to a friend in
front of the king and Queen. He had a co,

1553
01:28:36,140 --> 01:28:40,280
you know, eight, 10 Indians
and some parrot and some
goals and some native shit.

1554
01:28:40,550 --> 01:28:43,580
And they went, you know,
their minds are blown.

1555
01:28:43,610 --> 01:28:46,850
No one knew there was
another world right now.

1556
01:28:46,890 --> 01:28:48,320
I mean people knew
there was another world,

1557
01:28:48,321 --> 01:28:50,750
but they didn't know that you
could go find a new one like that.

1558
01:28:50,780 --> 01:28:55,370
Like he came back with people from
another place who spoke Arawak and had

1559
01:28:55,371 --> 01:29:00,080
fucking monkeys. What the fuck
is this? Here's a bunch of men,

1560
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:02,460
10 times more money,
a bunch more boats.

1561
01:29:02,461 --> 01:29:06,630
The second expedition was hugely funded
and he went up with horses, cannons,

1562
01:29:06,631 --> 01:29:08,760
the whole fucking Enchilada.
Wow.

1563
01:29:08,790 --> 01:29:12,460
The first one was like when you send
your friend to fucking Home Depot, you,

1564
01:29:12,470 --> 01:29:15,390
here's my car, don't use
the blinker. You know,

1565
01:29:16,170 --> 01:29:18,900
he barely made it there
and back on the first one.

1566
01:29:19,370 --> 01:29:21,900
And yes he did do all those
horrible things to the Indians.

1567
01:29:21,900 --> 01:29:25,620
He was had no notion of them as people.

1568
01:29:25,621 --> 01:29:30,000
He was a strict Catholic. He believed that
he'd been singled out by God. That too,

1569
01:29:30,810 --> 01:29:32,000
just the idea of custody,

1570
01:29:32,460 --> 01:29:35,220
those arms off cause they didn't bring
enough gold and doing it in front of

1571
01:29:35,221 --> 01:29:40,221
their family knew that if he didn't
produce precious goods for the Spanish

1572
01:29:40,621 --> 01:29:42,690
crown, that he wasn't going
to keep getting funded.

1573
01:29:42,691 --> 01:29:47,670
When he went back and that was the driving
to keep going and pushing through to

1574
01:29:47,671 --> 01:29:52,320
Asia was what he was after to find
China cause he knew there'd be ivory and

1575
01:29:52,321 --> 01:29:56,520
pearls and all that shite total. But look
what he look at it on the other hand,

1576
01:29:56,970 --> 01:29:59,760
within 20 or 30 years at Columbus,
now they're in Mexico.

1577
01:29:59,761 --> 01:30:03,090
And within another hundred years of that,
the largest silver mine in the world,

1578
01:30:03,091 --> 01:30:04,290
that giant mountain of silver,

1579
01:30:04,291 --> 01:30:09,291
that all of the silver of Asia for 400
years came from because of the Spanish

1580
01:30:09,391 --> 01:30:11,100
trade routes between China and shit.

1581
01:30:11,550 --> 01:30:16,550
They reduced a mountain of silver in
Mexico and some in South America too.

1582
01:30:16,681 --> 01:30:20,760
And you use the Indians to fucking do
it on the mountain of silver. I mean,

1583
01:30:20,790 --> 01:30:24,640
there's a book called 1493,
uh,

1584
01:30:25,430 --> 01:30:29,580
Charles Mann. Well, well, using Columbus
is the line of demarcation for everything.

1585
01:30:29,750 --> 01:30:33,030
There's a book called 1491 and a
book called 1492. And the vehicle,

1586
01:30:33,450 --> 01:30:36,810
because he's the first contact,
you know,

1587
01:30:36,811 --> 01:30:41,220
between west and east or between, between
the Americas and you and the old world.

1588
01:30:41,790 --> 01:30:46,650
And, uh, on his boat he had, he
was Italian. He had Portuguese.

1589
01:30:46,680 --> 01:30:48,520
If there was some Spanish there,
some genuine,

1590
01:30:48,521 --> 01:30:52,650
it's probably a couple of donations. Uh,
by the time Cortez, when Cortez came over,

1591
01:30:52,651 --> 01:30:56,880
which is what, 30 years after, there
was women conquistadores on his boat,

1592
01:30:57,060 --> 01:30:58,320
women concaves dead.

1593
01:30:58,321 --> 01:31:01,680
There was about two or three conquistador
has in his book why they don't tell

1594
01:31:01,681 --> 01:31:06,350
you all the fun stuff, kind of game of
Thrones. Exactly. Big giant warrior.

1595
01:31:06,430 --> 01:31:10,050
Imagine what a bad acid or you had to
beat a beyond that fucking mission and

1596
01:31:10,051 --> 01:31:12,570
Cortez burn the boats and took
a vote with everybody and said,

1597
01:31:12,580 --> 01:31:14,700
you want to go back or not? And
they were like, he goes, okay,

1598
01:31:14,701 --> 01:31:18,620
this is how it's gonna go. We know
where the capital of the [inaudible],

1599
01:31:18,660 --> 01:31:20,990
this is our mission and let's look.

1600
01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:24,300
And they got all the Indians along
the way and that's how they did it.

1601
01:31:24,301 --> 01:31:26,790
And they burned the boats.
They couldn't go back. Yeah.

1602
01:31:26,820 --> 01:31:29,370
But according to one book
I read by Bernal Diaz,

1603
01:31:29,371 --> 01:31:31,590
who was the last survivor of that mission,

1604
01:31:31,890 --> 01:31:35,760
he landed up in like Honduras or whatever,
the little ranch when he was old.

1605
01:31:35,761 --> 01:31:37,650
He writes the forward,
I'm old and I'm blind now,

1606
01:31:37,651 --> 01:31:40,920
but I'm going to tell you what the fuck
happened when on the mission with Cortez

1607
01:31:41,430 --> 01:31:45,630
and he'd been on a previous one with
another conquistador and then he says he

1608
01:31:45,631 --> 01:31:49,110
didn't just say we're burning
the boats. We took a vote. Whoa.

1609
01:31:49,140 --> 01:31:51,090
Captain General Cortez said to the boys,

1610
01:31:52,050 --> 01:31:55,860
parrot is you can go back to Cuba where
they were living or you can go back to

1611
01:31:55,861 --> 01:32:00,861
Spain where you got nothing horsch gold
and fucking glory in to notate lawn and

1612
01:32:02,081 --> 01:32:05,530
you may die and they may eat.
You eat your heart out.

1613
01:32:06,470 --> 01:32:11,020
Such an ability to take risks back then.
It's pretty extraordinary.

1614
01:32:11,021 --> 01:32:14,230
I mean the genocide and the Indians
is of course the disgusting part.

1615
01:32:14,231 --> 01:32:18,550
But I mean the Aztecs did have a
organized army and you know, it wasn't,

1616
01:32:19,660 --> 01:32:21,220
it wasn't a hundred Spanish guys.

1617
01:32:21,221 --> 01:32:24,220
They had tens of thousands
of Indians in their army.

1618
01:32:24,221 --> 01:32:27,160
When they finally laid the big battle out,

1619
01:32:27,700 --> 01:32:31,360
Columbus on the other hand just Kinda
maraud around the Caribbean and tried to

1620
01:32:31,361 --> 01:32:34,990
get these poor fucking Indians
who had no gold to give him gold.

1621
01:32:34,991 --> 01:32:38,620
And he was in the wrong country, man.
You know America's where gold as well.

1622
01:32:38,621 --> 01:32:42,220
Didn't they give him something at some
point in time they gave him a little

1623
01:32:42,221 --> 01:32:46,000
baubles but those bottles would come
from the mainland or child across the

1624
01:32:46,001 --> 01:32:50,040
Caribbean or from South America where
there was stuff and that they didn't have

1625
01:32:50,041 --> 01:32:52,600
any gold there. So they were weighing
little earrings and nose rings and Shit.

1626
01:32:52,601 --> 01:32:54,740
And He'd be like,
that was it though.

1627
01:32:54,760 --> 01:32:58,270
Total focus and they couldn't understand
it cause they're giving him chicks and

1628
01:32:58,570 --> 01:33:01,810
food and like, what else
do you want? We don't have,

1629
01:33:02,470 --> 01:33:05,860
we don't have fucking the gold.
And why is the Goldson wouldn't you?

1630
01:33:05,861 --> 01:33:07,330
It's not important to us.
They were like,

1631
01:33:08,380 --> 01:33:13,030
and he just went as soon as he saw any
gold. That was the end of that. We have,

1632
01:33:13,500 --> 01:33:15,010
how do they have this?

1633
01:33:15,400 --> 01:33:18,880
Obviously they have that one account from
Cortez you were talking about from one

1634
01:33:18,881 --> 01:33:19,420
of the people that,

1635
01:33:19,420 --> 01:33:22,240
oh there's loads of accounts of
Cortez cause there's friars that row.

1636
01:33:22,270 --> 01:33:23,980
How do they have these accounts?
Oh,

1637
01:33:23,981 --> 01:33:27,680
Columbus wrote a diary and a guy's
on the ship wrote diaries and a,

1638
01:33:27,681 --> 01:33:31,450
there's a famous a priest who was the
sort of the conscience of the new world

1639
01:33:31,660 --> 01:33:34,780
who decried the genocide against
the Indians from the very beginning.

1640
01:33:35,050 --> 01:33:38,710
And the Spanish kept meticulous records
and there's a giant library in Seville

1641
01:33:38,860 --> 01:33:43,150
called the library of the indies
where all of the Caucasians are doors.

1642
01:33:43,151 --> 01:33:47,140
Fucking documents are collated and
captain. So there's, that's awesome.

1643
01:33:47,260 --> 01:33:51,670
Are Legal Society. So you brought a priest
with you, you bought a notary with you,

1644
01:33:51,671 --> 01:33:55,210
you brought lawyers with you, you brought
generals with you, you brought a doctor,

1645
01:33:55,390 --> 01:33:58,720
you wrote shit down. You fucking,
when you took over a town,

1646
01:33:58,721 --> 01:34:01,660
you wrote a sign and
posted a crucifix sense.

1647
01:34:01,720 --> 01:34:05,080
So how much did you agree to the Indians
who can't understand you that you are

1648
01:34:05,081 --> 01:34:07,720
taking over their town and the
name of the King of Spain and Chin?

1649
01:34:07,870 --> 01:34:12,540
How much bullshit, all of that.
I mean, you know, so when the,

1650
01:34:12,640 --> 01:34:15,250
when they would tell their
version of the events,

1651
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:17,590
how much of it was bullshit
histories all spinning, isn't it?

1652
01:34:17,870 --> 01:34:20,380
I don't think all of it's bullshit
because there's a lot of real,

1653
01:34:20,870 --> 01:34:24,760
also Indians wrote accounts later
who learns within a generation.

1654
01:34:24,761 --> 01:34:27,340
Obviously there's Mexicans,

1655
01:34:27,460 --> 01:34:31,140
which are the marriage of
Indians and Spanish. Right.

1656
01:34:31,540 --> 01:34:34,270
And uh,
within a generation,

1657
01:34:34,990 --> 01:34:39,580
all of the Aztec Nobles of which there
were lots and all the nobles in Mexico

1658
01:34:39,581 --> 01:34:43,570
from the Indian tribes married into rich,
you know, married into Spanish family.

1659
01:34:43,571 --> 01:34:48,571
So they were raised as rich people who
spoke Spanish now and they were able to

1660
01:34:48,911 --> 01:34:51,370
tell their stories as well.

1661
01:34:51,730 --> 01:34:54,190
There's a lot of first person
accounts by the explorers.

1662
01:34:54,191 --> 01:34:59,060
Cabeza de Vaca kept a diary and I mean is,
is great because it's so self serving,

1663
01:34:59,061 --> 01:34:59,730
you know,

1664
01:34:59,730 --> 01:35:03,920
o nit whole portions of the journey and
he doesn't mention some of the ratty

1665
01:35:03,921 --> 01:35:07,460
shitty did and the radish shit was all
ratted out by priests. Right? Yeah.

1666
01:35:07,490 --> 01:35:11,450
And then later expeditions
within by the second expedition,

1667
01:35:11,451 --> 01:35:12,730
guys were mutinying on and,
and,

1668
01:35:12,731 --> 01:35:16,090
and fucking going back to Spain
and ratting on and then vet.

1669
01:35:16,190 --> 01:35:18,770
He was a terrible and competent
fucking commander and that he had,

1670
01:35:18,890 --> 01:35:21,620
once they got on land, he was useless
and he didn't know how to handle it.

1671
01:35:21,621 --> 01:35:25,250
The Indians and there was always in her
violence with the cruise killing each

1672
01:35:25,251 --> 01:35:28,940
other and choosing sides and hiding on
different parts of the island from each

1673
01:35:28,941 --> 01:35:30,740
other and not doing
what he asked him to do.

1674
01:35:30,890 --> 01:35:33,500
He was a terrible commander on the sea.

1675
01:35:34,190 --> 01:35:37,580
The greatest thing you can
say about Columbus's, he's
an extraordinary navigator.

1676
01:35:37,581 --> 01:35:40,760
He knew that there was going to
be a trade wind and he caught it.

1677
01:35:41,300 --> 01:35:44,990
Having had some of that knowledge,
he knew that if he went down and got it,

1678
01:35:44,991 --> 01:35:49,340
he could come and get one back and I
think he guessed that he surmised that or

1679
01:35:49,341 --> 01:35:54,341
he knew from other sailors and shit that
you wouldn't actually get lost in die.

1680
01:35:54,530 --> 01:35:59,210
You could come back to
Europe from wherever you were
going in Asia and he didn't

1681
01:35:59,211 --> 01:36:03,230
have a a telescope.
This is previous to the telescope,

1682
01:36:03,231 --> 01:36:08,231
so he is dead reckoning and evidently
was terrible with instruments.

1683
01:36:08,691 --> 01:36:12,590
Like he had an astro lab and he had a
sextant but he couldn't fucking use them

1684
01:36:12,591 --> 01:36:15,140
very well.
So all of his reckonings in the book,

1685
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:17,780
Andy kept two separate notebooks.

1686
01:36:17,930 --> 01:36:22,930
One with his navigational charts and
another with fake ones in case anybody

1687
01:36:24,530 --> 01:36:27,710
caught him cause he didn't want anybody
copying is root cause he thought he was

1688
01:36:27,711 --> 01:36:32,330
going to have the monopoly on going to
the new world. And so within of course,

1689
01:36:32,331 --> 01:36:34,790
20 years, within, within four years,

1690
01:36:34,791 --> 01:36:37,370
there's a whole bunch of other Spanish
vessels coming over and you know,

1691
01:36:37,730 --> 01:36:40,990
within 10 years it's all over.
There's growing lever.

1692
01:36:40,991 --> 01:36:43,790
So when he first starts writing it down,
you said he's writing,

1693
01:36:43,791 --> 01:36:47,960
he's not using instruments. He,
he could, he had instruments what?

1694
01:36:47,961 --> 01:36:48,860
They're crappy,

1695
01:36:49,220 --> 01:36:53,870
they didn't have any idea of longitude.

1696
01:36:53,871 --> 01:36:57,770
Right. Latitude was kind
of a free flowing affair.

1697
01:36:58,010 --> 01:37:01,990
If you had shit you could focus on
like stars or bodies of, you know,

1698
01:37:02,020 --> 01:37:04,010
islands or whatever
that you could navigate,

1699
01:37:04,460 --> 01:37:09,440
which is why those mounts of the
world always seems so small from them.

1700
01:37:09,960 --> 01:37:10,490
Um,

1701
01:37:10,490 --> 01:37:15,490
so he had to reckon by currents and
winds and the color of the water,

1702
01:37:16,760 --> 01:37:20,350
how the water,
the salinity of the water tasted.

1703
01:37:20,750 --> 01:37:22,610
They had a rope with thumbs on it,

1704
01:37:22,611 --> 01:37:26,480
marked in knots and that take soundings
to see how fucking deep the sea was.

1705
01:37:26,481 --> 01:37:29,930
And all of a sudden when they got near
and the crew was having a heart attack,

1706
01:37:29,931 --> 01:37:33,980
cause they'd been out for a couple months
and it's true. The crew was like, hey,

1707
01:37:34,100 --> 01:37:38,840
we're going to die. And he said,
calm the fuck down. And the next day,

1708
01:37:39,640 --> 01:37:42,140
uh,
clearly something a human had made,

1709
01:37:42,141 --> 01:37:46,040
like a carved paddle hit the boat
and they pulled it out than what,

1710
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:50,150
you know,
there's something over there.

1711
01:37:50,390 --> 01:37:54,230
And then the next day a bunch of
branches and shit. And then birds.

1712
01:37:54,290 --> 01:37:57,240
And when there's birds and branches,
there's fucking islands.

1713
01:37:57,540 --> 01:38:01,960
And they knew then the men started to
get hip to the fact that he wasn't wrong,

1714
01:38:01,961 --> 01:38:03,810
that there was something over there.

1715
01:38:04,110 --> 01:38:08,340
And then of course see he said whoever
sees the island first gets a prize and

1716
01:38:08,341 --> 01:38:11,820
the guy in the middle of the night saw
the lights and he said when they got up

1717
01:38:11,821 --> 01:38:13,110
in the day,
I saw him last night

1718
01:38:14,710 --> 01:38:18,790
do shouted his crew never loved him.
What lights did he see?

1719
01:38:19,330 --> 01:38:23,530
Fires to? Indians were
burning. Oh Wow. Fascinating.

1720
01:38:23,630 --> 01:38:25,200
I know, right. That's amazing.

1721
01:38:25,500 --> 01:38:29,330
It's really weird to think
of their gear navies.

1722
01:38:29,720 --> 01:38:31,950
No rifles on the first expedition.
Maybe a couple,

1723
01:38:31,970 --> 01:38:36,970
not rifles like Arca buses that you lit
a fuse and put it in a breach and you

1724
01:38:37,101 --> 01:38:41,030
know you gotta pack it down, pack it
down with the ball, low crossbows,

1725
01:38:41,031 --> 01:38:43,970
a few costs. Suppose that was considered
real high tech to have those with you.

1726
01:38:44,150 --> 01:38:48,920
That was a big deal to have like an
organized group of Cross Bowman because an

1727
01:38:48,921 --> 01:38:52,480
organized group across group Bowman
could wipe out lots of people out.

1728
01:38:52,500 --> 01:38:54,080
Whatever's accurate.
Yeah,

1729
01:38:54,650 --> 01:38:57,710
the armor thing never worked out for
them with all the conquistadores.

1730
01:38:57,711 --> 01:39:00,890
Within a few weeks they'd all fucking
started wearing the Indians armor because

1731
01:39:00,891 --> 01:39:03,290
it was too hot,
too much stuff.

1732
01:39:03,740 --> 01:39:06,430
They were metal and metal rots
in the jungle and shit and this,

1733
01:39:07,170 --> 01:39:11,030
so the Indians had fabulous cotton
textiles that made, made, you know,

1734
01:39:12,050 --> 01:39:13,030
so Columbus is

1735
01:39:13,650 --> 01:39:14,730
his journals.

1736
01:39:14,910 --> 01:39:18,990
They were all his own way
of measuring the salinity,

1737
01:39:18,991 --> 01:39:21,600
his own way of measuring
the color of the water.

1738
01:39:21,750 --> 01:39:24,450
So he would just describe
that like that's how he knew

1739
01:39:24,590 --> 01:39:28,000
she had been at sea
since he was a teenager.

1740
01:39:28,001 --> 01:39:31,540
Genewiz tended to go to ca cause they
were slave traders and there was always a

1741
01:39:31,541 --> 01:39:33,040
tradition of slavery in Genoa,

1742
01:39:33,220 --> 01:39:36,940
which is why he didn't
perceive the Indians is people
as much as his first thing

1743
01:39:36,941 --> 01:39:41,690
he wrote back was like, I think we found
a bunch of slaves here, you know? Wow,

1744
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:43,510
we can use these people to build stuff.

1745
01:39:43,511 --> 01:39:48,130
And then of course their temperament was
not that way and he didn't manage any

1746
01:39:48,131 --> 01:39:49,270
of the situations.
Right.

1747
01:39:49,271 --> 01:39:53,800
And he betrayed everybody and that's
why it all went so horribly shitting.

1748
01:39:53,830 --> 01:39:56,680
All those Indians are dead.
There's no Caribbean Indians.

1749
01:39:57,160 --> 01:40:01,510
It's just weird when you stop and think
about what a short amount of time ago

1750
01:40:01,511 --> 01:40:06,130
that was. Oh my God. So
short days, it was 500 years.

1751
01:40:06,131 --> 01:40:08,320
Seems like a long time for one person.

1752
01:40:08,680 --> 01:40:11,770
But once you've been alive for a little
while and like you're in your forties

1753
01:40:11,771 --> 01:40:14,020
and you start looking and going,
you know that didn't take that long.

1754
01:40:14,021 --> 01:40:17,200
It seemed like he moved pretty quick.
How many of these are left?

1755
01:40:17,500 --> 01:40:21,700
How many of them do you get in the life?
My mother was 94 when she passed away.

1756
01:40:22,230 --> 01:40:26,170
That five of those born in 1919
yeah. Five lives. Birth to death.

1757
01:40:26,171 --> 01:40:29,740
And you're dealing with like the most
horrible atrocities that you know we have

1758
01:40:29,741 --> 01:40:30,700
like on record,

1759
01:40:30,810 --> 01:40:35,370
there was no chat lines when my mother
was born. There was no, it's so weird.

1760
01:40:35,371 --> 01:40:36,870
Ads are growing up in Columbus,

1761
01:40:36,871 --> 01:40:39,390
Ohio because that's named
after Christopher Columbus.

1762
01:40:39,391 --> 01:40:41,490
And there's all these
fucking statues everywhere.

1763
01:40:41,491 --> 01:40:45,220
Like just like celebrating this man and
you grew up in school celebrating the

1764
01:40:45,230 --> 01:40:49,460
sky and it's just weird now like reading
what we looked at the men and not at

1765
01:40:49,480 --> 01:40:54,040
any other reality. Keep talking. Should
we? Oh, okay. We can adjourn if you like.

1766
01:40:55,180 --> 01:40:59,750
I know. Right? And if you go to Seville,
there's a giant statue of him. Uh,

1767
01:40:59,830 --> 01:41:02,720
and there's one in Barcelona to,
you're looking out over the scene.

1768
01:41:03,190 --> 01:41:08,190
And then the statue in Seville is in the
cathedral and he's being carried in a

1769
01:41:08,861 --> 01:41:09,820
litter,
you know,

1770
01:41:09,940 --> 01:41:14,940
by four Indians from different tribes
and they're wearing their Indian garb.

1771
01:41:16,300 --> 01:41:19,720
And he's in a big brass.
But I are like that.

1772
01:41:20,020 --> 01:41:24,010
And his foot is rubbed completely
shiny cause it's good luck to rub.

1773
01:41:24,011 --> 01:41:26,740
Columbus's put in,

1774
01:41:26,741 --> 01:41:31,210
Seville was on a river and every year
when the fleet would come back to treasure

1775
01:41:31,211 --> 01:41:32,320
fleet from the new world,

1776
01:41:32,590 --> 01:41:37,210
they'd be ladened down like almost to
the water line with fucking gold and

1777
01:41:37,211 --> 01:41:38,920
precious goods and people and stuff.

1778
01:41:39,130 --> 01:41:42,700
And they'd come up the river and there
was a chain across the river and Sybil

1779
01:41:42,710 --> 01:41:47,290
and they'd pull the chain out and,
and it sail up the river.

1780
01:41:47,291 --> 01:41:50,720
And that was a big event every year
because when the treasure fleet came back,

1781
01:41:50,721 --> 01:41:53,770
it was like, and of course Spanish
people got none of that money.

1782
01:41:53,890 --> 01:41:56,020
It's just the crown.
And then what did they do?

1783
01:41:56,021 --> 01:41:58,660
Wage war against the French in the hall,

1784
01:41:58,690 --> 01:42:01,900
the Dutch and the English for fucking
300 years and blew all the money.

1785
01:42:02,230 --> 01:42:03,040
Did you see that,

1786
01:42:03,040 --> 01:42:06,890
uh, document that documentary
about Sunset Boulevard?

1787
01:42:07,700 --> 01:42:11,440
No. You should really see, are we
still trying to get the director?

1788
01:42:12,290 --> 01:42:15,860
We're working on that. The history of
sunset. It's real interesting. Oh yeah.

1789
01:42:16,230 --> 01:42:18,830
How old are they used
to have one like street,

1790
01:42:18,860 --> 01:42:21,590
like dirt road going down the street.
And that's really,

1791
01:42:21,740 --> 01:42:24,090
that's a really cool movie. I recommend.
I'd like to I think make a map.

1792
01:42:24,170 --> 01:42:25,970
Well I know I saw another
one that was about like,

1793
01:42:26,870 --> 01:42:30,650
you know that its heyday in the 60s and
all that jazz when it was go go joints

1794
01:42:30,651 --> 01:42:34,910
and Zeros.
You watched a documentary on Ciro's?

1795
01:42:35,120 --> 01:42:39,020
Well it included sue us and then it had
the riots and you know Jim Morrison and

1796
01:42:39,030 --> 01:42:41,720
whiskey in the hall,
you know like a groovy that's right.

1797
01:42:41,721 --> 01:42:43,610
Their whiskies on sunset.
Yeah.

1798
01:42:43,611 --> 01:42:48,611
What a fucking street facing rain that
to be across the street from the store

1799
01:42:48,831 --> 01:42:53,280
before the House of Blues used
to be a hotel, I believe. Yeah.

1800
01:42:54,830 --> 01:42:55,970
I just drove by it today.

1801
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:59,180
But then there's that high at that's
next stored to the comedy store or that's

1802
01:42:59,181 --> 01:43:00,150
two doors down.

1803
01:43:00,350 --> 01:43:03,260
And if you remember the newly sergeant
pepper's lonely hearts club band,

1804
01:43:03,261 --> 01:43:06,480
let Peter Frampton they stay in that
hotel cause they come out of that inosine.

1805
01:43:06,760 --> 01:43:09,290
Really? Yeah. The one
with the Skybar no, no.

1806
01:43:09,291 --> 01:43:13,380
The one on the other side of the street
on the comedy store style though.

1807
01:43:13,660 --> 01:43:16,790
Right back a tiny.
What does that,

1808
01:43:17,810 --> 01:43:22,380
what's the hotel kind of that
standard is a standard, uh,

1809
01:43:23,200 --> 01:43:26,210
our, is that what it is? Something
like something like that.

1810
01:43:26,211 --> 01:43:30,590
It's for some fancy Schmancy, very
nice hotel. But the um, that's on,

1811
01:43:30,840 --> 01:43:35,000
that's that area like out has
an insane look. That view.

1812
01:43:35,330 --> 01:43:39,160
That's what that is. Yeah. Well there's,
there's so many spots like that on that,

1813
01:43:39,680 --> 01:43:40,860
those hotels there,

1814
01:43:41,010 --> 01:43:44,060
they all have little pools and
scenes at the pool and all that jazz.

1815
01:43:44,270 --> 01:43:45,530
You weren't in a,

1816
01:43:45,540 --> 01:43:47,570
where are you in San Francisco
when that guy jumped off the roof?

1817
01:43:47,571 --> 01:43:50,720
That was before your time, right?
Wait, before you talked to the Hyatt,

1818
01:43:50,750 --> 01:43:54,450
the who was protesting during
the Jay Leno days. Oh golly. The,

1819
01:43:54,451 --> 01:43:59,300
the comedy store. And the Improv,
I guess comics were like picketing.

1820
01:43:59,330 --> 01:44:03,440
They were on like, oh Golly, day back.
What was that? That was like, wait,

1821
01:44:03,441 --> 01:44:07,160
that wasn't a seven Letterman when
let him, it was a standout. Oh,

1822
01:44:07,340 --> 01:44:12,230
was it really that far? Yeah, that's
right. Well, they, um, they, uh, you know,

1823
01:44:12,231 --> 01:44:15,040
that's like kind of a famous spot,
right?

1824
01:44:15,320 --> 01:44:18,440
Just trying to get any money for science.
Yeah.

1825
01:44:19,550 --> 01:44:23,660
It's a weird thing that they're working
for free and Hollywood and we still do,

1826
01:44:23,690 --> 01:44:26,030
I still do shows for free all the time.
Yeah.

1827
01:44:26,031 --> 01:44:30,340
Well I think it's important to
work out a lot. So, you know,

1828
01:44:30,350 --> 01:44:34,490
doing those free shows, it's good.
Let's you fuck around guilt free,

1829
01:44:34,580 --> 01:44:35,690
try out new shit.
And like,

1830
01:44:35,691 --> 01:44:38,480
sometimes I'll go up and
I'll intentionally put myself
in like a little bit of a

1831
01:44:38,481 --> 01:44:41,810
hole by just starting out with
an idea that's kind of half ass,

1832
01:44:41,811 --> 01:44:45,200
like panic my way into figuring
the way through the bit. You know,

1833
01:44:45,350 --> 01:44:49,740
I wouldn't do that in a regular show,
but uh, one of those. Yeah. Yeah.

1834
01:44:49,880 --> 01:44:53,810
One of those just show up shows.
Those are, um, they're interesting.

1835
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:56,730
They're good but good to fuck
around. Free range chicken. Yeah.

1836
01:44:56,810 --> 01:44:58,400
That's the other good thing about La man.

1837
01:44:58,430 --> 01:45:02,150
There's an amazing community comedians
out here, but think about that.

1838
01:45:02,350 --> 01:45:06,590
Just the sheer volume of clubs
and comedians and the breadth,

1839
01:45:07,130 --> 01:45:11,060
like every type of Canadian, oh, he
got to these other towns and you know,

1840
01:45:11,061 --> 01:45:14,730
you go everywhere and I'll work in
a place in God's will be like, oh,

1841
01:45:14,731 --> 01:45:16,250
I don't know if I were to move to Atlanta.
I'm like,

1842
01:45:16,840 --> 01:45:20,390
he advised that if he got to
a place on a Tuesday night,

1843
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:24,950
you're following fucking patent
and Sarah Silverman and shit.

1844
01:45:24,951 --> 01:45:28,610
Like he didn't just walk into it.
You know I got your game.

1845
01:45:28,640 --> 01:45:32,480
Your game has to get you came together.
If I want him to shut someone down,

1846
01:45:32,540 --> 01:45:37,540
I would love to have a Greg
Proops announcement like
that would be an incredible

1847
01:45:38,841 --> 01:45:43,430
service that you could
provide. Be advised, like the
way you would phrase things,

1848
01:45:43,700 --> 01:45:47,480
if you continue this down,

1849
01:45:47,481 --> 01:45:50,960
the road of altercation with my
client results will be catastrophic.

1850
01:45:51,290 --> 01:45:53,040
I think you'll find the uncertain times.

1851
01:45:55,820 --> 01:45:57,740
I advise.
Great caution in that regard.

1852
01:45:58,760 --> 01:46:02,530
Now you can't just a
swan up here and I mean,

1853
01:46:02,540 --> 01:46:04,400
I think the only important
thing in La is like,

1854
01:46:04,670 --> 01:46:06,770
I remember reading it
in a magazine years ago,

1855
01:46:06,860 --> 01:46:11,540
a guy like said the three important
things about being in La. He's like, no,

1856
01:46:11,541 --> 01:46:14,120
why you're here. What's the
number one wine? He goes,

1857
01:46:14,180 --> 01:46:17,390
if you're here to sleep with people,
then that's what you're here for. Yeah,

1858
01:46:17,391 --> 01:46:21,060
I'm fucking bullshit me and tell me a
riding it thing. Right? If you're writing,

1859
01:46:21,400 --> 01:46:24,020
write that thing. There is a lot
of that, right? Well that's the,

1860
01:46:24,021 --> 01:46:27,680
he said the reason why you're here,
do you, the reason why you're here.

1861
01:46:27,681 --> 01:46:32,150
And then the second one was returned
your fucking calls, which I thought was,

1862
01:46:32,390 --> 01:46:35,720
those are two good pieces. I mean
if people go to lunch, go to la,

1863
01:46:35,721 --> 01:46:39,980
but a little bit like a teach come to
be an actor, teach, come to be a comic.

1864
01:46:40,220 --> 01:46:43,730
Did you come to write it then? You know,
not that you can't do them all at once,

1865
01:46:44,090 --> 01:46:45,410
but if you're going to say you're a comic,

1866
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:47,630
you got to go out and work
every night and be, do comedy,

1867
01:46:47,631 --> 01:46:50,940
you have to be seen and
doing in my opinion.

1868
01:46:51,120 --> 01:46:55,620
You say you want to be a comment until
you make a living doing comedy and then

1869
01:46:55,621 --> 01:47:00,240
you say I'm a comic. Yeah cause there's
a lot of comics out there and I get it.

1870
01:47:00,270 --> 01:47:03,210
You're still a comedian.
I guess you are still a complex sort of.

1871
01:47:03,240 --> 01:47:05,550
There's a lot of guys who actually
never graduated from open mic.

1872
01:47:05,640 --> 01:47:09,120
I don't want to mention any names but
they're really funny guys. They just,

1873
01:47:09,310 --> 01:47:10,920
I guess those are the,
that gets my argument.

1874
01:47:11,130 --> 01:47:14,360
My argument just fell apart because
they got yourself stuck comics. Yeah.

1875
01:47:14,400 --> 01:47:16,260
Well the whole goal was
to make a living on it.

1876
01:47:16,320 --> 01:47:17,910
When you first start to make money at it,

1877
01:47:17,940 --> 01:47:20,310
you can't believe that
you're getting any money.

1878
01:47:21,240 --> 01:47:25,380
And then when you start to make a living
at it, which chicken takes a long time.

1879
01:47:25,381 --> 01:47:28,260
I think it took care of
not just starting now.

1880
01:47:28,261 --> 01:47:31,830
That's what's weird to me cause I
took advantage of the web. You know,

1881
01:47:31,831 --> 01:47:35,190
as a comedy, you know, we're
selling our special on the web.

1882
01:47:35,191 --> 01:47:38,520
We do our fucking shows on the web.
This wasn't available to us, man.

1883
01:47:38,610 --> 01:47:40,170
And the promotion and the ability,

1884
01:47:41,790 --> 01:47:43,930
the ability to be you on your podcast.

1885
01:47:43,931 --> 01:47:45,900
Like we were talking about
that before we even started,

1886
01:47:45,901 --> 01:47:48,540
like no one would really
let you do that. No, no one.

1887
01:47:48,541 --> 01:47:51,450
I would just say great proves just
here's the, you know, two hours.

1888
01:47:51,451 --> 01:47:55,800
This kit it right, right here. We
won't say anything. We'll fucking,

1889
01:47:55,980 --> 01:47:59,310
everything you do, love it or hate it will
be positive and you fucking high five.

1890
01:47:59,310 --> 01:48:01,500
You know, now that someone's
always going to have enough.

1891
01:48:01,810 --> 01:48:03,950
I know that was never going
to happen in the old ship is,

1892
01:48:03,951 --> 01:48:05,540
and so I kind of like this,
uh,

1893
01:48:05,970 --> 01:48:09,060
what you should do guys do sort of like
an odd couple shows since you've been

1894
01:48:09,061 --> 01:48:10,740
emailing back and forth with that dude,

1895
01:48:11,010 --> 01:48:15,000
get that dude on the podcast with you
and he gets to sit next to you and go,

1896
01:48:15,001 --> 01:48:18,150
yeah,
well here's a bunch of fucking bunch of

1897
01:48:20,290 --> 01:48:22,530
bullshit.
It's a bunch of liberal bullshit.

1898
01:48:22,531 --> 01:48:24,800
I didn't call me to hear liberal
bullshit. All right. Right.

1899
01:48:24,810 --> 01:48:28,350
And just keep me honest the whole time.
The king, what the fuck is this bullshit?

1900
01:48:28,470 --> 01:48:30,560
It's a good idea. It could
be like sort of, you know,

1901
01:48:30,990 --> 01:48:35,220
like some sort of a top art type thing.
He likes red meat.

1902
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:40,170
It'd be a good battle, Greg.
It's keen law, each other.

1903
01:48:40,171 --> 01:48:44,700
Men's Dicks. Do you, um,
uh, read, uh, any, uh,

1904
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,010
you have like a regular
reader of history books?

1905
01:48:47,011 --> 01:48:49,710
Is that how you know so much about
Columbus or you just fascinated by that?

1906
01:48:49,950 --> 01:48:51,480
Well,
I read a bunch of Columbus books.

1907
01:48:51,481 --> 01:48:54,210
There's one called the four
of wages by Larry Bird drawn.

1908
01:48:54,240 --> 01:48:57,750
Then there's Columbus's own version.
I was playing in Bloomington,

1909
01:48:57,751 --> 01:49:01,260
Indiana at that nice a comedy club
there. And uh, I haven't been,

1910
01:49:01,310 --> 01:49:05,700
there was a bookstore in Bloomington.
Bloomington's God the attic. Okay.

1911
01:49:06,090 --> 01:49:06,930
And uh,

1912
01:49:07,560 --> 01:49:10,980
in the bookstore I found Columbus as the
four voyages and I'd already read this

1913
01:49:10,981 --> 01:49:13,430
other guy's book and this was
Columbus as account and if,

1914
01:49:13,500 --> 01:49:17,580
and his son Bartella Mayo and then
someone else too. So I thought, well,

1915
01:49:17,581 --> 01:49:20,580
I'll read it as account and see
what the fuck him, you know,

1916
01:49:20,640 --> 01:49:21,810
to get another source.

1917
01:49:22,920 --> 01:49:26,400
And then right now I'm reading a book
about Da Vinci painting the last supper

1918
01:49:26,401 --> 01:49:30,120
and stuff like that. It
was pretty, you know,

1919
01:49:30,900 --> 01:49:33,270
these people don't seem like people,
you know,

1920
01:49:33,300 --> 01:49:36,220
like you say you are
disconnected from the reality of,

1921
01:49:36,690 --> 01:49:40,740
but then when you think like,
uh, it's set in this book,

1922
01:49:40,741 --> 01:49:45,630
like Davinci would write like notes like
uh, got a German kid work and for me,

1923
01:49:46,240 --> 01:49:47,450
you know,
like it is notebook.

1924
01:49:48,170 --> 01:49:51,010
How'd you go to the store? I needed
to buy socks or whatever. You're like,

1925
01:49:51,011 --> 01:49:54,430
it makes it more, and the Davinci didn't
spend all this time making masterpieces.

1926
01:49:54,580 --> 01:49:57,700
He designed sets and costumes for loads.
You know,

1927
01:49:57,701 --> 01:50:00,250
they're always having events in pageants.
He was in a royal court,

1928
01:50:00,280 --> 01:50:02,560
so he did a lot of that.

1929
01:50:02,800 --> 01:50:06,200
He invented like stage such that opened
up and there'd be freaky shit inside

1930
01:50:06,240 --> 01:50:08,590
everybody. Oh my God.
Like he did special thugs.

1931
01:50:08,650 --> 01:50:11,830
He was unbelievably brilliant and
sketched all the time, period.

1932
01:50:11,831 --> 01:50:14,110
A book with them all the time.
So you don't always have the notebook.

1933
01:50:14,290 --> 01:50:17,620
That's why there's so much of his stuff
left. Cause he wrote so many notebooks.

1934
01:50:18,040 --> 01:50:22,480
Yeah. And when you start thinking about
the people that have though of that day,

1935
01:50:22,510 --> 01:50:27,280
the Leonardo Davinci's, the
Michelangelo's, the great,
great artists of the past.

1936
01:50:27,310 --> 01:50:31,330
It's hard to wrap your head around
what their life must've been life.

1937
01:50:31,600 --> 01:50:35,720
No medicine, you know, they
have nothing. Barely nothing.

1938
01:50:36,520 --> 01:50:38,440
No. The band. And he had some saws.

1939
01:50:38,441 --> 01:50:41,890
If your fucking leg studio is pretty
big though, it wasn't really. Yeah.

1940
01:50:41,891 --> 01:50:42,970
The one he had an uh,

1941
01:50:43,060 --> 01:50:47,530
Milan was pretty big because his patron
gave him like a used calsl they weren't

1942
01:50:47,531 --> 01:50:51,250
using anymore. So he had a nice big
space and a few guys working for him.

1943
01:50:51,251 --> 01:50:54,400
And I share a little Italian kid that
stole all the time and would buy candy

1944
01:50:54,401 --> 01:50:58,530
with the money stolen shit. Oh yeah. I
like, it becomes a little more human,

1945
01:50:58,540 --> 01:51:00,880
you know,
and that he's just gay basically.

1946
01:51:00,940 --> 01:51:05,940
He's just gay kid one really says anything
like Leonardo as queer and apparently

1947
01:51:05,981 --> 01:51:08,410
really good looking and amazingly
strong could bend a horseshoe.

1948
01:51:08,700 --> 01:51:11,740
This is the last thing you want a
gay guy who could bend a horse shoe.

1949
01:51:11,880 --> 01:51:16,840
Just devastatingly handsome, strongest,
a better artist in you, funnier than you.

1950
01:51:16,900 --> 01:51:19,960
Better musician than he played the
lion's gay. That's the balance.

1951
01:51:20,080 --> 01:51:23,890
Gay and the dental. He, he was real witty
guy who lived hundreds of years ago.

1952
01:51:24,090 --> 01:51:24,900
Well talk,

1953
01:51:24,900 --> 01:51:28,570
he's so famous still because he was
the life of the goddamn renaissance,

1954
01:51:28,571 --> 01:51:29,860
you know.
Oh I'm sure.

1955
01:51:30,100 --> 01:51:33,580
Well I mean you talk about
bad motherfuckers who've
named have carried through

1956
01:51:33,581 --> 01:51:36,220
the ages. Leonardo,
Stephanie Nardo, Davinci.

1957
01:51:36,221 --> 01:51:38,510
I mean he did so many
amazing illustrations.

1958
01:51:38,520 --> 01:51:41,580
Some the human body and its ideas of,
you know,

1959
01:51:41,630 --> 01:51:46,630
his ideas of how to sculpt things and how
to draw things and how to space things

1960
01:51:48,221 --> 01:51:49,900
was so advanced and brilliant.

1961
01:51:50,170 --> 01:51:54,010
It is ridable like placement
of the images and his work.

1962
01:51:54,220 --> 01:51:58,510
There's so there's like, you know, when
they do studies of, of works of art,

1963
01:51:58,511 --> 01:52:01,690
like what is appealing
about certain pieces of art?

1964
01:52:01,870 --> 01:52:05,470
It's so difficult to
like count the tangibles.

1965
01:52:05,471 --> 01:52:09,340
Like what is it as a sense of symmetry?
Is it the depth of perception of,

1966
01:52:09,580 --> 01:52:13,020
of distance and space? What is it
about this piece? It's so remarkable,

1967
01:52:13,080 --> 01:52:14,350
remarkable and striking.

1968
01:52:14,530 --> 01:52:17,350
And because it's not necessarily
always the subject matters,

1969
01:52:17,351 --> 01:52:21,250
how the subject matter's displayed and
there's so many variables. It could be,

1970
01:52:21,251 --> 01:52:23,380
it could look so different. So weird. So,

1971
01:52:23,400 --> 01:52:27,340
so when a guy comes along like Leonardo
Davinci and you look at his stuff and

1972
01:52:27,341 --> 01:52:32,110
you go, fuck God damn, this
dude nail it. He just nailed it.

1973
01:52:32,260 --> 01:52:35,120
He spent all his time studying motion and,

1974
01:52:35,121 --> 01:52:39,550
and visual effects that he has no
books filled with how the water looks,

1975
01:52:39,551 --> 01:52:42,250
when it's misty, how the water looks,
when it's rough, how the water looks,

1976
01:52:42,251 --> 01:52:45,800
when it's a tempest, when there's
a storm, when it's calm, when like

1977
01:52:46,130 --> 01:52:49,640
he felt like artists should walk
around and watch people all the time.

1978
01:52:49,641 --> 01:52:54,080
He had insane notebooks of every kind
of movement of every kind of person of

1979
01:52:54,081 --> 01:52:57,770
every and the physiognomy ones. I just
saw when I was in Scotland, they had,

1980
01:52:57,771 --> 01:53:01,010
and then a museum there when I was at
Edinburgh and we went and saw all of his

1981
01:53:01,011 --> 01:53:04,460
physiological notebooks and there
was all these uh, anatomists.

1982
01:53:04,461 --> 01:53:07,310
Now talking about this is
more advanced than what we do.

1983
01:53:07,340 --> 01:53:09,140
Look at the perspective
on how each of the hands,

1984
01:53:09,320 --> 01:53:13,670
he had corpses and he just spent days
and weeks and months and years fucking

1985
01:53:13,940 --> 01:53:18,940
studying out the tendons worked and
drawing these intricate and unbelievably

1986
01:53:19,521 --> 01:53:23,230
anatomically correct from
shaded perspectives, you know,

1987
01:53:23,240 --> 01:53:26,360
from many perspectives,
not just, you know,

1988
01:53:26,390 --> 01:53:29,390
just so that he could have almost
like a database visual. Yeah.

1989
01:53:29,391 --> 01:53:32,550
His visual cognition.
It's just like far past any,

1990
01:53:32,551 --> 01:53:34,460
but I think it was because
he made a study of every,

1991
01:53:34,730 --> 01:53:38,030
which is why I think he determined that
you could make machines that will fly in.

1992
01:53:38,540 --> 01:53:41,420
I don't think it was great leaps of
imagination. He studied birds, you know,

1993
01:53:41,421 --> 01:53:46,280
and he studied everything. Like he was
a, they didn't call it science then,

1994
01:53:46,281 --> 01:53:48,080
but you know, as a scientist. Yeah.

1995
01:53:48,260 --> 01:53:52,820
That's the thing is that he wasn't really
bogged down by an a title so much as

1996
01:53:52,821 --> 01:53:54,830
he would be today.
Being an art.

1997
01:53:54,831 --> 01:53:57,920
I mean it's hard to be an artist and an
inventor today unless you're like Kanye

1998
01:53:57,920 --> 01:53:58,220
West.
He can do

1999
01:53:58,220 --> 01:54:02,750
both. Oh, and a holy figure. The
smaller spiritual leader from my,

2000
01:54:03,170 --> 01:54:06,960
my thing here, people, the props
people, the proofs or so per person.

2001
01:54:06,961 --> 01:54:09,520
Do you guys call each other the
pupil Lupus Pruett balloons.

2002
01:54:12,200 --> 01:54:16,520
We watched Prue Lu, uh,
wheat for proofs. Um,

2003
01:54:17,300 --> 01:54:19,520
and our slogan is don't look back.
Something might be proofing on.

2004
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:24,510
Is that your a theme? It is our thing.
Sorry, I'm still hurting at that ground.

2005
01:54:24,810 --> 01:54:29,350
Zero. That cassette away way
back in 1988 tonic. So sad.

2006
01:54:29,440 --> 01:54:30,790
She was hot as fuck.
Super Hot.

2007
01:54:31,310 --> 01:54:32,143
Damn.

2008
01:54:32,150 --> 01:54:34,700
Well that was when she got in front of
them and print a crotch in his face while

2009
01:54:34,701 --> 01:54:38,120
he was driving. That was the part of the
video. Like someone's gonna get hurt.

2010
01:54:38,150 --> 01:54:40,880
It's all fun and games when someone's
got their skip and your face,

2011
01:54:40,960 --> 01:54:45,470
until women just looked different back
then with the crazy hair and the men had

2012
01:54:45,471 --> 01:54:48,950
the crazy hair too crazy
hit both crazy hair.

2013
01:54:49,430 --> 01:54:51,170
Remember she was on a Jaguar?
Oh yeah.

2014
01:54:51,200 --> 01:54:54,260
Flipping around the jailer
and unforgettable and
doing the splits and shit.

2015
01:54:57,190 --> 01:54:59,470
I know what it means to walk along.

2016
01:55:01,140 --> 01:55:04,800
Yeah. There's a lonely road or something
like that. Just dreams, but not,

2017
01:55:05,920 --> 01:55:10,350
there's the music of that era that
was like what happened to America?

2018
01:55:10,620 --> 01:55:12,090
What happened to the world?

2019
01:55:12,330 --> 01:55:14,850
What happened to the
consciousness of the human beings?

2020
01:55:14,880 --> 01:55:16,920
Is it because they were
denied psychedelics?

2021
01:55:17,280 --> 01:55:20,340
I really wonder because if you look at
the difference between the music in the

2022
01:55:20,341 --> 01:55:25,341
1970s from 1970 to the music of the
1980s there's some weird sort of a,

2023
01:55:25,830 --> 01:55:30,420
like a detached gets more Koki
and less, less jugging. Yeah,

2024
01:55:30,421 --> 01:55:34,590
and it's this weird detachment,
but from, from real, you know,

2025
01:55:34,591 --> 01:55:38,190
if you go back to this day,
like listen to Voodoo child,

2026
01:55:38,280 --> 01:55:41,760
listen to the live version of
it, how organic it, it's insane.

2027
01:55:41,790 --> 01:55:44,460
It's insane how good fucking song is.

2028
01:55:44,790 --> 01:55:46,950
It's insane how good that guitar solo is.

2029
01:55:46,951 --> 01:55:51,951
It like hurts your brain but then go
and listen to some shit from the 80s you

2030
01:55:52,771 --> 01:55:52,861
know,

2031
01:55:52,861 --> 01:55:57,150
that was like really popular back then
that you might've liked and you'll be

2032
01:55:57,151 --> 01:55:59,820
like,
what the fuck was wrong with these people?

2033
01:56:00,400 --> 01:56:04,110
Like she'll look at the movies they made.
You'll look at,

2034
01:56:04,200 --> 01:56:05,490
look at the movies they made,

2035
01:56:05,491 --> 01:56:08,310
some of the movies they made in the 80s
and then go back and think about some of

2036
01:56:08,311 --> 01:56:10,950
the shit they made in the sixties and
seventies and it still holds up today.

2037
01:56:10,951 --> 01:56:12,840
Like the hustler,
you know,

2038
01:56:13,140 --> 01:56:17,100
things that reflect the human condition
instead of weird science. There's some,

2039
01:56:17,130 --> 01:56:19,620
there were some amazing
Gainey's feeds back then.

2040
01:56:19,800 --> 01:56:23,940
There were some amazing like who's
afraid of Virginia Woolf still holds up.

2041
01:56:23,960 --> 01:56:27,840
Oh yeah. It still holds
up. Well writing, you know,

2042
01:56:28,260 --> 01:56:30,900
writing and characters. Right,
but why did that go away?

2043
01:56:30,901 --> 01:56:34,230
Why didn't that get better? Everything
gets better. If you look at today's era,

2044
01:56:34,500 --> 01:56:38,610
if you look at like from if you go back
to like father knows best and then you

2045
01:56:38,611 --> 01:56:43,500
look at today with like say like
homeland or the game of Thrones,

2046
01:56:43,501 --> 01:56:46,860
the writing has gotten so much better.
The shows we've gotten so much better.

2047
01:56:46,980 --> 01:56:51,630
There's such an incredible like evolution
of culture that's so blatantly obvious

2048
01:56:51,631 --> 01:56:56,580
on, on television. Yeah. So why
doesn't that exist for what happens?

2049
01:56:56,581 --> 01:56:57,510
Where's that blip?

2050
01:56:57,540 --> 01:57:02,540
That weirdness from from the 70s to
the eighties to the nineties and two

2051
01:57:02,791 --> 01:57:06,870
thousands they like finally like rock
the shit back straight and got Jesus,

2052
01:57:07,020 --> 01:57:10,140
what the fuck are we doing? And now
they're making all this amazing shit.

2053
01:57:10,141 --> 01:57:13,500
But they were making amazing shit. They
were making the twilight zone. They were,

2054
01:57:13,501 --> 01:57:18,501
they had really original interest in
programming in twilight zone is fucking

2055
01:57:18,541 --> 01:57:23,370
brilliant to this day. Scifi plays
repeats and I set it, set it on my Dvr,

2056
01:57:23,371 --> 01:57:24,810
wants just thinking this would be fun.

2057
01:57:24,811 --> 01:57:28,500
Something to watch one night and
I'm bored and I'm just hooked.

2058
01:57:28,940 --> 01:57:33,420
Watching walling after the, I watched
three, four in a row. They're amazing.

2059
01:57:33,421 --> 01:57:38,280
They're so good. They all have three
writing is so good and they're concise.

2060
01:57:38,640 --> 01:57:42,840
Captain Kirk, when William Shatner was,
when he was going through that, uh,

2061
01:57:42,841 --> 01:57:47,040
the machine that tells you your future.
Yeah. Oh my God. That's a good episode.

2062
01:57:48,030 --> 01:57:52,050
I love that show. Burgess Meredith. Oh,
that one survives the end of the world.

2063
01:57:52,080 --> 01:57:55,140
Don't forget. Oh my God. It's
incredible. I don't even want to give us,

2064
01:57:56,990 --> 01:57:57,480
can you say,

2065
01:57:57,480 --> 01:58:02,480
spoiler alert on a twilight zone
from 1963 he can because I find that,

2066
01:58:02,551 --> 01:58:05,160
I think I talk about things
on my show that I think, well,

2067
01:58:05,161 --> 01:58:07,770
everybody knows this and then he
[inaudible]. Everybody doesn't know.

2068
01:58:07,910 --> 01:58:10,350
Everybody's frame of
reference is different than
people at different ages and

2069
01:58:10,351 --> 01:58:12,140
they didn't grow up with that.
Sell peep.

2070
01:58:12,210 --> 01:58:14,640
There's people out there listening
right now who are like twilight tone.

2071
01:58:15,480 --> 01:58:18,720
What does this show you speak of?
They don't even know about the movies.

2072
01:58:18,721 --> 01:58:23,150
This purchase Meredith you speak of are
just married and just married man. Yeah,

2073
01:58:23,151 --> 01:58:27,870
he, yeah. Spoiler alert. He played a guy
that really wanted books. Just be alone.

2074
01:58:28,170 --> 01:58:31,880
I can't tell you anymore.
[inaudible] you anymore.

2075
01:58:32,430 --> 01:58:36,400
The other great. William Schachter.
One man on the plane. Yeah.

2076
01:58:37,830 --> 01:58:42,470
Fuck. That was crazy. The
fucking outfit is so bad.

2077
01:58:42,480 --> 01:58:46,420
It's just terrible. So bad. Yes.
Tara, we played it on the podcast.

2078
01:58:46,421 --> 01:58:50,230
We showed the clip of the monster, the
monster, like a monkey with a helmet on.

2079
01:58:50,231 --> 01:58:53,390
Kind of. It's a furry, yeah, he's a furry.

2080
01:58:54,330 --> 01:58:57,490
It really does the of for if you
haven't seen it, Brian Polo Shit up man.

2081
01:58:57,491 --> 01:59:00,850
On the wing of the plane. William
Shatner. Twilight zone. Just images.

2082
01:59:03,590 --> 01:59:08,390
Yeah. Incredible. But just
the, the sheer originality.

2083
01:59:08,420 --> 01:59:13,040
Like they were on to something and then
you know, later you got the fall guy.

2084
01:59:13,150 --> 01:59:17,870
Like what happened? They get sued. He
got, you know, some stupid shit, man.

2085
01:59:17,871 --> 01:59:19,800
Older girls,
some good show.

2086
01:59:20,360 --> 01:59:23,450
Magnum Pi was a good cognitive cop drama.

2087
01:59:23,750 --> 01:59:27,170
He sort of had a message and you know,
he was a guy like searching for truth.

2088
01:59:27,171 --> 01:59:30,230
Look at this fucking thing.
Ah,

2089
01:59:31,280 --> 01:59:34,860
look how bad that thing is.
There's some other images, Bri,

2090
01:59:34,861 --> 01:59:39,190
where it's actually on the plane where
you get a whole body. Oh, it's us do.

2091
01:59:39,191 --> 01:59:43,160
There it is to the left over.
That is, oh my God, that's stupid.

2092
01:59:44,350 --> 01:59:45,770
Yeah.
Why was it a furry?

2093
01:59:47,380 --> 01:59:51,760
That is the least scary thing that's ever
been a scary part was just that you'd

2094
01:59:51,761 --> 01:59:52,720
be looking at your,

2095
01:59:53,110 --> 01:59:57,010
I think that the jet plane experience
was so sexy and exciting in the early

2096
01:59:57,010 --> 01:59:59,490
sixties so like, oh my God,
there's a monster on the way.

2097
01:59:59,530 --> 02:00:03,430
Well that was actually a propeller plane.
Oh, is it? Yeah. That's a propeller plane.

2098
02:00:03,431 --> 02:00:06,820
The guy actually puts his fingers in
the propeller and gets it and hurts his

2099
02:00:06,821 --> 02:00:11,250
finger and he's like, stop it. Oh,
he's so nice. He said that. Yes.

2100
02:00:11,770 --> 02:00:16,450
He was like poking at the, uh, the, the
helicopter blade propeller assignments.

2101
02:00:16,530 --> 02:00:21,220
You know, that's not the same amount on
that. I am the same animal. That's you.

2102
02:00:21,280 --> 02:00:25,900
That's me. Cute little dog. That's a
little crippled Lebanon. Yeah. Well what,

2103
02:00:26,320 --> 02:00:30,190
I mean I just wonder what happened that,
that weird cultural blip.

2104
02:00:30,340 --> 02:00:33,910
The eighties essentially it's the
eighties where it seems like things just,

2105
02:00:34,270 --> 02:00:37,990
it really does feel like there was
like a slide, like, like, oh, like,

2106
02:00:38,080 --> 02:00:42,400
like the culture got rocked and for
like a decade and how to recover.

2107
02:00:43,330 --> 02:00:46,660
And then through the nineties is like
biggie getting its feet back under it and

2108
02:00:46,661 --> 02:00:49,540
you start seeing like really good
comedy and a lot of good things start

2109
02:00:49,541 --> 02:00:53,860
happening and then boom, it's bad. I
don't know. I liked the A's, but yeah,

2110
02:00:53,861 --> 02:00:56,170
I know what you're saying.
It wasn't the deepest decade of all Tom,

2111
02:00:56,171 --> 02:00:58,900
although in the 70s everybody kept
calling it the me decade and that we were

2112
02:00:58,901 --> 02:01:01,480
really shallow and I kind of
enjoyed the 70 shares. Yeah,

2113
02:01:01,810 --> 02:01:04,430
well the eighties were a big coke era.
You're definitely right about that.

2114
02:01:04,690 --> 02:01:06,430
I wasn't that cookie
then, but yes, it was.

2115
02:01:06,431 --> 02:01:09,280
And I think everything was
informed by that. Yeah.

2116
02:01:09,370 --> 02:01:12,100
And also there's the rise
of like capitalist heroes,

2117
02:01:12,101 --> 02:01:16,750
which I always hated Gordon Gekko
types. Yeah. And the whole Reagan thing,

2118
02:01:16,751 --> 02:01:20,640
and I dunno, I just, I never dragged
out part. You've always, well,

2119
02:01:20,650 --> 02:01:23,650
you're from San Francisco and you're
super liberal, man. Yeah. No matter what,

2120
02:01:23,651 --> 02:01:27,130
you'll always be super liberal.
That's true. This is, I'm
waiting for the tweeters.

2121
02:01:27,230 --> 02:01:31,210
He had a true off, you
know, I didn't tune in.

2122
02:01:31,510 --> 02:01:35,350
I didn't pay no money to gene in and
listen to this for free to hear proofs

2123
02:01:35,351 --> 02:01:37,270
jockeys fucking fruity bag shit.

2124
02:01:37,420 --> 02:01:40,430
Well your points of view are all based

2125
02:01:40,460 --> 02:01:42,140
on, you know, a pretty,

2126
02:01:42,160 --> 02:01:47,160
very pretty reasonable ethical
standard and your ideas are all,

2127
02:01:47,240 --> 02:01:50,960
you know, very progressive, open minded.
I didn't, you're not a ridiculous person.

2128
02:01:50,961 --> 02:01:52,280
I've known you for a long time.
You're,

2129
02:01:52,281 --> 02:01:56,330
you're very well thought out and all the
things that you say when there's some

2130
02:01:56,331 --> 02:02:00,920
people though that also pulled opinion
similar to yours that need to be

2131
02:02:00,921 --> 02:02:01,580
throttled.

2132
02:02:01,580 --> 02:02:05,000
I couldn't agree more there on my team
and I don't want them on my team and

2133
02:02:05,001 --> 02:02:08,240
that's why I don't like my team and
that's why I try to stay on my own team

2134
02:02:08,241 --> 02:02:12,550
because I'd act ya this George Carlin said
I'm on the sidelines. You know, there's

2135
02:02:12,660 --> 02:02:16,020
no doubt there's some annoying as
fuck people on the right as well.

2136
02:02:16,200 --> 02:02:20,520
But something makes me really upset
when I find like really aggressive

2137
02:02:20,521 --> 02:02:23,510
progressive people like
overly aggressive progressive,

2138
02:02:23,520 --> 02:02:27,270
the point of like causing like arguments
that are totally unnecessary and

2139
02:02:27,271 --> 02:02:30,030
feeling completely in
the right for doing it.

2140
02:02:30,360 --> 02:02:35,360
It's like really loud and Barky
version of progressive ideology.

2141
02:02:36,271 --> 02:02:37,104
It's like,

2142
02:02:37,540 --> 02:02:41,200
well, also I like, I like a
little more open minded as to let,

2143
02:02:41,290 --> 02:02:45,000
she liked to be the overriding notion,
not my way.

2144
02:02:45,070 --> 02:02:48,970
Right in your way and strong.
Like I would have smoking in bars.

2145
02:02:49,390 --> 02:02:52,060
I don't see that as wrong.
It's a health issue.

2146
02:02:52,120 --> 02:02:55,990
You say that because you smoke and I
think you enjoy it and I am all for

2147
02:02:56,200 --> 02:02:59,370
personal choice. I'm all for, you
should be allowed to have a bar.

2148
02:02:59,890 --> 02:03:00,723
That's what I say.

2149
02:03:01,070 --> 02:03:05,170
What I meant was I would have bars with
smoking and then bars without smoking.

2150
02:03:05,200 --> 02:03:08,380
I think the devil could do that. Would
you or were you allowed to do that before?

2151
02:03:08,381 --> 02:03:11,830
Were you allowed to say no smoking in your
establishment before the laws changed?

2152
02:03:11,920 --> 02:03:15,550
I remember a comedy club. Oh, and
they witness who came in on the road.

2153
02:03:16,680 --> 02:03:21,260
Let's, nevermind this. Looking at
you a million different issues of uh,

2154
02:03:21,370 --> 02:03:24,190
but this,
the legal age of drinking,

2155
02:03:24,250 --> 02:03:27,930
if he can vote when you're 18 then
why is it 21 to drink and would

2156
02:03:27,940 --> 02:03:30,730
you be able to go to war when you're
seven? Thank you. And you, you can't,

2157
02:03:30,750 --> 02:03:31,720
you kill some money,

2158
02:03:31,721 --> 02:03:35,620
but you can't like figure out whether or
not this is ego that's ego or this has

2159
02:03:35,621 --> 02:03:39,550
beneficial that he should be informed.
I think eventually, hopefully,

2160
02:03:39,580 --> 02:03:41,230
and I've said this to Ad Nauseum,

2161
02:03:41,260 --> 02:03:42,790
I think we're going to be
able to vote on the Internet.

2162
02:03:42,820 --> 02:03:46,780
We're going to see a radically different
version of what people want and don't

2163
02:03:46,781 --> 02:03:49,900
want. And that's the only way this country
has ever really going to be at peace.

2164
02:03:50,200 --> 02:03:52,150
That's the only way people are
ever going to really be at peace.

2165
02:03:52,330 --> 02:03:55,150
We need like a council of elders,

2166
02:03:55,180 --> 02:04:00,180
a council of wise men that
that sort of display th they,

2167
02:04:00,820 --> 02:04:05,820
they get on television and with no
vested interest educate people on what's

2168
02:04:06,881 --> 02:04:11,881
wrong with the system and how the world
works and what direction they advise

2169
02:04:12,131 --> 02:04:12,940
that we act.

2170
02:04:12,940 --> 02:04:17,680
Then the people just vote on everything
that fucking happens and everybody gets

2171
02:04:17,681 --> 02:04:21,910
to do it on your fucking phone and yes,
there's gonna be some disastrous results.

2172
02:04:21,911 --> 02:04:25,120
Miley Cyrus would probably be the first
president, but we'll work that shit out.

2173
02:04:25,540 --> 02:04:29,140
We'll figure out what's not fuckers like
that. They're always going to be that.

2174
02:04:29,141 --> 02:04:30,850
But we'll figure that out eventually.

2175
02:04:30,910 --> 02:04:35,110
And with the education and the access
to information that's also available

2176
02:04:35,111 --> 02:04:35,561
because of this,

2177
02:04:35,561 --> 02:04:38,340
I don't think we really completely
wrapped her head around the impact.

2178
02:04:38,341 --> 02:04:42,540
The Internet has honest. No.
We look at the stuff from like,

2179
02:04:42,541 --> 02:04:45,650
I'm watch this documentary searching
for sugar man. Yeah, I saw it.

2180
02:04:46,020 --> 02:04:49,120
It really interesting.
Right. And I just started it.

2181
02:04:49,680 --> 02:04:52,500
It was only a 40 minute plane ride
from San Francisco this weekend,

2182
02:04:52,620 --> 02:04:56,140
but when I was listening, which
has happened, Brian would just to,

2183
02:05:00,330 --> 02:05:04,800
what happened, one of the lights
is was making some noises.
Oh, okay. That was, yeah,

2184
02:05:04,801 --> 02:05:06,930
those weird, it's the one under
the table here near me. Yeah.

2185
02:05:07,380 --> 02:05:10,990
But what was fascinating
was watching that, that V,

2186
02:05:11,030 --> 02:05:12,810
I mean it's a real time machine.

2187
02:05:12,840 --> 02:05:16,290
When you look at the footage of the use
and that film of like driving around

2188
02:05:16,291 --> 02:05:20,280
Detroit in the 1970s beautifully,
beautifully shot,

2189
02:05:20,790 --> 02:05:24,600
but you get this sense of this,
this weirdness of that time,

2190
02:05:24,750 --> 02:05:25,840
you know that just be,

2191
02:05:26,040 --> 02:05:29,010
and then you just stop and think about
the life that we're living right now and

2192
02:05:29,011 --> 02:05:32,460
how fucking weird that's going to be from
people in the future when they try to

2193
02:05:32,461 --> 02:05:36,590
digest like these were the
first motherfuckers to have
the Internet, right? The,

2194
02:05:36,600 --> 02:05:39,720
the whole world as the Internet now we're
so used to it cause it's been here for

2195
02:05:39,721 --> 02:05:44,340
500 years,
but back then the world went upside down.

2196
02:05:45,110 --> 02:05:48,720
The government started falling, people
started getting access to information.

2197
02:05:48,720 --> 02:05:53,250
Religion started declining and
previously never before reported numbers.

2198
02:05:53,390 --> 02:05:57,570
But the point where there's
real legitimate scientific
studies that say within

2199
02:05:57,571 --> 02:05:59,970
the next hundred years,
there may not be any religion.

2200
02:06:00,340 --> 02:06:02,640
Like it may be like a really rare thing.

2201
02:06:02,670 --> 02:06:06,600
Like that's how crazy the world is moving.

2202
02:06:06,780 --> 02:06:09,660
That's how fast it's moving and
that's how much things are changing.

2203
02:06:09,780 --> 02:06:12,850
They're just changing in front of our
eyes to the point where it's, it's,

2204
02:06:12,870 --> 02:06:15,980
it's just a normal part of everyday life.
Hey, I don't know, Google it. You boop,

2205
02:06:16,070 --> 02:06:19,860
boop, tweet me. Oh my God, I've got to
retweet that. It's crazy story. Bam,

2206
02:06:20,010 --> 02:06:21,230
and then everybody else does it.

2207
02:06:21,280 --> 02:06:23,400
Then you've got millions of people
that are doing it to each other,

2208
02:06:23,401 --> 02:06:25,220
sending it and sending
it and sending that that,

2209
02:06:25,250 --> 02:06:30,250
that new distribution of information that
can't be underestimated that that's on

2210
02:06:30,691 --> 02:06:35,190
a world changer. It's a world changer.
We didn't have it 10 years ago. No,

2211
02:06:35,460 --> 02:06:39,400
10 years ago fit 10 native,
but it wasn't as like this,

2212
02:06:40,040 --> 02:06:44,310
this is, this is so beneficial.
20 years ago. No Way. Not at all.

2213
02:06:44,400 --> 02:06:46,680
There's a lot of cons online for sure,

2214
02:06:46,830 --> 02:06:51,830
but you can find some really cool pockets
of people online to some really Nice,

2215
02:06:52,981 --> 02:06:57,120
interesting, friendly people.
There's a gang of message boards.

2216
02:06:57,330 --> 02:07:00,450
There's a gang of, of people that
you can connect to on Twitter,

2217
02:07:00,750 --> 02:07:04,980
so really unique time, like is it the
amount of people that you interact with?

2218
02:07:05,070 --> 02:07:10,070
I think that it's more people kind of
availed themselves of what a tool it is.

2219
02:07:11,040 --> 02:07:14,280
You can learn a lot off your
computer or your phone or you can,

2220
02:07:14,310 --> 02:07:17,410
but people don't ease it for that.
They just go on Facebook or,

2221
02:07:19,980 --> 02:07:23,730
yeah, so a lot of that.
Well, that's so easy.

2222
02:07:23,731 --> 02:07:25,560
I need my own personal porn blocker

2223
02:07:27,240 --> 02:07:29,670
when someone comes over my house and I
have to show them something. My Youtube,

2224
02:07:29,910 --> 02:07:34,620
I have to type Y o u t very quickly
because it wants to go to [inaudible].

2225
02:07:35,710 --> 02:07:40,510
You know how like I predict at least
it's huge is and not something else and

2226
02:07:40,511 --> 02:07:45,190
that's, yeah, you suck my cock.
Oh yeah. I like it in jail.

2227
02:07:45,191 --> 02:07:47,970
You Ooh,
I like it up my butt.

2228
02:07:49,740 --> 02:07:52,420
This whenever you want end to
end. Right now. We can keep going.

2229
02:07:52,421 --> 02:07:55,450
We can do whatever we want. I could
go, there's no reason you can go.

2230
02:07:55,451 --> 02:07:57,850
You can leave or you could
go. You could talk. No,

2231
02:07:58,160 --> 02:08:01,690
I probably should go pretty soon. You
should leave pretty early. We can stop.

2232
02:08:01,960 --> 02:08:04,940
We've been doing like couple hours. I
got a couple of hours, right? Yeah. Well,

2233
02:08:04,960 --> 02:08:07,930
you don't want a cine that even it's too,
I've been two hours, about two hours,

2234
02:08:08,590 --> 02:08:12,300
two hours and almost 15 minutes. Yeah,
that's a nice long length for podcasts.

2235
02:08:12,330 --> 02:08:12,941
I was enjoyable.

2236
02:08:12,941 --> 02:08:15,640
We did with the last thing I ever want
it to be is not enjoyable anymore.

2237
02:08:15,970 --> 02:08:19,590
So like when your time is up, but when
you look at career clock and you go, hmm,

2238
02:08:19,600 --> 02:08:22,200
I gotta be somewhere.
We just have to look at them.

2239
02:08:22,290 --> 02:08:25,540
We just have became a man
and a bestowed your, your,

2240
02:08:25,541 --> 02:08:26,740
your beautiful wisdom upon us.

2241
02:08:27,160 --> 02:08:28,150
Thanks for having me again.

2242
02:08:28,210 --> 02:08:32,140
Thank you for letting me annually come
back and talk about Columbus ad nauseum.

2243
02:08:33,010 --> 02:08:36,310
You can come back anytime you want and
talk about the same shit over and over

2244
02:08:36,311 --> 02:08:37,990
again and I don't give a
fuck. I appreciate it. Joe.

2245
02:08:38,290 --> 02:08:41,170
Your show is very
intellectually engaging and a,

2246
02:08:41,180 --> 02:08:43,780
I don't think there's anything like it,
uh,

2247
02:08:43,781 --> 02:08:47,830
of all the shows because uh,
you know,

2248
02:08:47,970 --> 02:08:51,260
you're willing to explore any
and all areas and uh, and uh,

2249
02:08:51,470 --> 02:08:54,860
and take on a lot of different
philosophies in this. Yeah,

2250
02:08:54,880 --> 02:08:58,630
there's no question and answer. It's
fantastic. It's just a free flowing

2251
02:08:58,770 --> 02:09:01,980
well, there's so much out there in the
world. I think at this point in time,

2252
02:09:01,981 --> 02:09:04,710
there's so many different things to think
about in so many different subjects to

2253
02:09:04,711 --> 02:09:07,560
cover and so many different
fascinating things to discuss.

2254
02:09:07,890 --> 02:09:11,790
And as long as you discuss it like
that, you know of you, you, you just,

2255
02:09:11,820 --> 02:09:15,630
you just look at things objectively
and openly and you try not to have any

2256
02:09:15,631 --> 02:09:19,170
personal biases going into them and
try to look at every different angle.

2257
02:09:19,410 --> 02:09:24,390
The world is a fascinating, fascinating,
fascinating place. There's just, it's,

2258
02:09:24,600 --> 02:09:28,000
I think we're in this weird boiling time.
It's like never before seen

2259
02:09:28,500 --> 02:09:33,260
summation. I feel panicked and I
feel uh, chased and I feel, you know,

2260
02:09:33,750 --> 02:09:36,920
yeah. I think everybody does
that right now is a real weird

2261
02:09:38,630 --> 02:09:39,650
feeling in the air.

2262
02:09:39,850 --> 02:09:44,770
Yeah. I worry about the everything
across the board from the ocean,

2263
02:09:44,830 --> 02:09:48,210
right to the, the melting and the
polar ice caps. I worry about the,

2264
02:09:48,211 --> 02:09:52,180
the threat of war. I worry about drone
attacks. I worry about nuclear disasters.

2265
02:09:52,720 --> 02:09:56,200
There's so much that can go wrong, but
yet it's still so exciting. Oh, of course.

2266
02:09:56,201 --> 02:09:58,570
There's the amazing time to be alive.
We're so lucky.

2267
02:09:58,600 --> 02:10:01,960
There's always the sun in the man, you
know? There's so much shit going on, man.

2268
02:10:01,961 --> 02:10:03,700
There's so much awesome comedy going on.

2269
02:10:03,701 --> 02:10:07,720
There's so many funny people and great
movies and there's just so much great

2270
02:10:07,721 --> 02:10:08,920
music and like the,

2271
02:10:08,940 --> 02:10:13,940
I think our culture right now this time
were people like anybody can just enter

2272
02:10:14,441 --> 02:10:18,640
into the fray, write a blog, make
some music, put it up online.

2273
02:10:18,850 --> 02:10:22,780
She made people share it, right? The show
us, show us your comedy, put it up online.

2274
02:10:22,780 --> 02:10:26,350
People share it. I mean this, this times,
it's never been anything like this.

2275
02:10:26,890 --> 02:10:28,850
The rules are off. That's
the best part. Yeah.

2276
02:10:28,960 --> 02:10:32,890
The rules are off and it's being used
in [inaudible] ways in some sometimes,

2277
02:10:32,900 --> 02:10:37,640
but overall the, I think that's
going to settle down. I really do.

2278
02:10:37,641 --> 02:10:41,030
I have faith in people.
I might be unwarranted faith.

2279
02:10:41,450 --> 02:10:46,420
I have faith in people based in what
I've seen from, from friends, their,

2280
02:10:46,460 --> 02:10:46,940
you know,

2281
02:10:46,940 --> 02:10:51,680
their emotional and physical growth
and what I've seen from more emotional

2282
02:10:51,681 --> 02:10:55,070
obviously, but, and when
I've seen from our culture,

2283
02:10:55,220 --> 02:10:58,970
I think that's one of the weird things
about who we are right now is the fact

2284
02:10:58,971 --> 02:11:03,500
that we're in the middle of all this
chaos and all this war and all this,

2285
02:11:04,050 --> 02:11:08,630
all the, all the racism and sexism and
all this devastating shit that we have.

2286
02:11:08,840 --> 02:11:09,770
On top of that,

2287
02:11:09,980 --> 02:11:14,980
we also have information that's flowing
like a raging river and no one can stop

2288
02:11:16,700 --> 02:11:18,800
including the government.
No one can stop it.

2289
02:11:18,801 --> 02:11:21,860
And people were organizing things and
there's some attempts that morning,

2290
02:11:22,040 --> 02:11:24,620
you know, like there's some occupy
Wall Street things that like,

2291
02:11:24,621 --> 02:11:26,990
it's a great idea and they're
focusing on this area,

2292
02:11:26,991 --> 02:11:29,540
but we're not exactly sure what happens.

2293
02:11:29,541 --> 02:11:32,670
But then there's anonymous that
goes after people. And then there's,

2294
02:11:33,260 --> 02:11:35,910
there's bitcoin guy who they
just, uh, they just, uh,

2295
02:11:35,970 --> 02:11:39,950
arrested who was running that
um, uh, Silk Road, Silk Road.

2296
02:11:40,220 --> 02:11:43,010
He lost all his bitcoins, right?
They took all his bitcoin.

2297
02:11:43,520 --> 02:11:46,010
Bitcoin's just went out of business.
Get coins went out of business too.

2298
02:11:46,280 --> 02:11:48,140
I think so.
I think it's the whole thing she does.

2299
02:11:48,141 --> 02:11:51,530
I think that was my croquet mallet
collection. These things to me,

2300
02:11:51,531 --> 02:11:56,531
I would like like the medical marijuana
of 1994 it's like once you open up the

2301
02:11:56,811 --> 02:12:00,050
door to that, give it 10 years
and watch what the fuck you guy.

2302
02:12:00,200 --> 02:12:04,270
You're going to have something crazy
10 years later after that 2013 what did

2303
02:12:04,271 --> 02:12:07,610
they have? Yeah, it fucking
madness. The streets of Los Angeles.

2304
02:12:07,611 --> 02:12:09,500
Every way you look as a fucking pot store.

2305
02:12:09,740 --> 02:12:12,980
Everywhere you look is a billboard with
a doctor that's willing to prescribe

2306
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:16,730
[inaudible] for anything.
My favorite ones on a Melrose,

2307
02:12:17,060 --> 02:12:19,190
I've been doing this for eight plus years.
It says

2308
02:12:20,710 --> 02:12:24,330
the doctor I'd been giving out
prescriptions for potheads.

2309
02:12:26,480 --> 02:12:29,840
That's so fun, isn't it? It's fantastic.
Yeah. No, you're right man. You're right.

2310
02:12:30,350 --> 02:12:32,210
I think that's the exciting
part of being alive.

2311
02:12:32,230 --> 02:12:34,260
Cause then I get through the news and
Shit on my shit and then people could go.

2312
02:12:34,261 --> 02:12:35,990
It's so depressing Greg. There's
no future. And I'm like, oh,

2313
02:12:35,991 --> 02:12:36,920
there's loads of future.

2314
02:12:37,340 --> 02:12:42,020
And I always feel like the editing is
the hidden element or not so hidden. Um,

2315
02:12:42,050 --> 02:12:45,260
young people of today don't have the
same mindset. So in 20 years time,

2316
02:12:45,290 --> 02:12:49,820
all of what we think is real and what's
happening isn't happening anymore.

2317
02:12:50,150 --> 02:12:51,560
And I think that's exciting too.

2318
02:12:52,010 --> 02:12:55,940
They don't give a shit about gay marriage
or any of these sticky issues that

2319
02:12:55,941 --> 02:12:58,070
were still hung up on. Nah, like
shutting the government down.

2320
02:12:58,670 --> 02:13:03,410
The government of 2040 is
the same. Government is today
and dead without a doubt.

2321
02:13:03,440 --> 02:13:07,070
Yeah. I mean there's some
people I'm sure in [inaudible],

2322
02:13:07,400 --> 02:13:08,930
but there's less and less dummies now.

2323
02:13:08,960 --> 02:13:11,360
I think as people realizing
that there's this,

2324
02:13:11,361 --> 02:13:15,710
there's an impact for the douchey sexism
or homophobia or whatever it is that

2325
02:13:15,711 --> 02:13:18,530
they're doing, there's an impact.
That impact hurts other people.

2326
02:13:18,650 --> 02:13:22,010
When you say concrete things to people,
it affects them.

2327
02:13:22,011 --> 02:13:23,480
When you have an attitude about people,

2328
02:13:23,481 --> 02:13:27,530
it affects them and then other people
affect you, they show displeasure of you,

2329
02:13:27,800 --> 02:13:31,330
and then you sort of get a balance.
I think that's what the,

2330
02:13:31,331 --> 02:13:33,030
the distribution of information does.

2331
02:13:33,031 --> 02:13:35,430
It allows people to even
things out a little bit easier.

2332
02:13:36,060 --> 02:13:39,330
And I think it also
ultimately as he ultimately,

2333
02:13:39,331 --> 02:13:42,780
it's going to make me feel
more kind because right now
they're able to do things

2334
02:13:43,020 --> 02:13:47,160
with without warrior the consequences
because they can do things anonymously

2335
02:13:47,161 --> 02:13:49,020
like you Facebook and
things along those lines.

2336
02:13:49,350 --> 02:13:51,150
I don't know how much
longer that's going to last.

2337
02:13:51,151 --> 02:13:53,430
It doesn't seem like it's
going to last that much longer.

2338
02:13:53,430 --> 02:13:55,530
It seems like eventually people
are gonna know who you are.

2339
02:13:55,531 --> 02:13:58,260
If you're posting things and then people
are going to be able to comment if they

2340
02:13:58,261 --> 02:13:59,580
know who you are,
they're going to be able to go.

2341
02:13:59,581 --> 02:14:03,090
Why did you say that to that guy? That
was fucking unbelievably douchey. Like,

2342
02:14:03,091 --> 02:14:05,490
hey man, the way you handled
that as wrong, or hey,

2343
02:14:05,491 --> 02:14:07,800
I really liked the way you
handled that. Or Hey, you know,

2344
02:14:07,801 --> 02:14:10,260
I really loved how you diffuse
that situation. You know,

2345
02:14:10,261 --> 02:14:13,920
and then we're going to get a lot more
feedback from a lot more different people.

2346
02:14:13,950 --> 02:14:16,440
