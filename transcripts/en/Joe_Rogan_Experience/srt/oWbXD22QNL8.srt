1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:02,890
Her low freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:08,160
It really does bring to
mind this incredible verse
in the Bhagavad Gita where

3
00:00:10,181 --> 00:00:14,500
Krishna is revealing his true form to
our June who's like the warrior figure.

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,000
And uh,

5
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:19,120
this is Oppenheimer's quote,

6
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,040
this is Oppenheimer's quote.

7
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:21,431
When he did,

8
00:00:21,431 --> 00:00:23,020
he said after the atomic bomb went off,

9
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:25,780
and I'm a quoted this part of
the Bhagavad Gita where he said,

10
00:00:25,781 --> 00:00:26,800
I have become death,

11
00:00:26,801 --> 00:00:28,240
the destroyer of worlds,

12
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:30,100
but it doesn't stop there.

13
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,110
Krishna's sang to Argentina,

14
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:33,820
something along the lines of,

15
00:00:33,821 --> 00:00:37,150
look in my teeth there you will see them,

16
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,440
everyone on this battlefield
because I'm eating them right now.

17
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:43,150
So this is like,

18
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:44,691
this is like Chris,

19
00:00:44,691 --> 00:00:45,130
it'd be like,

20
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:45,341
oh,

21
00:00:45,341 --> 00:00:46,530
you really want to see what I'm saying?

22
00:00:46,531 --> 00:00:50,050
Cause they've just been friends hanging
out and stuff and he like suddenly

23
00:00:50,051 --> 00:00:53,830
became the force of all
destruction in the known universe.

24
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,810
And the point of the thing was,

25
00:00:55,811 --> 00:00:56,644
listen,

26
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:59,200
all of this is already chewed up.

27
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:01,150
It's already been devoured.

28
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,800
It's already gone.

29
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,090
Game over.

30
00:01:04,091 --> 00:01:05,110
You're done.

31
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:07,660
No Kurzweil is going to
get you new blood cells.

32
00:01:07,661 --> 00:01:10,780
It's going to keep this going
to keep you alive at some point.

33
00:01:10,781 --> 00:01:13,300
I will come to you wearing
the costume of your death.

34
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:16,060
And that is an inevitability.

35
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:20,110
So just surrender to that and you're
going to be a lot less freaked out if you

36
00:01:20,111 --> 00:01:21,790
just accept that that's the way it is.

37
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:26,791
Because if your war that you're engaged
in right now is the war to live forever.

38
00:01:27,041 --> 00:01:31,150
If you're a war that you're engaged in
right now is a war to try to make some

39
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:36,510
lasting change in a universe that's
defined by impermanence and change,

40
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:37,930
then you're fighting the wrong war.

41
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:39,700
There's a better war to fight,

42
00:01:39,701 --> 00:01:40,534
you know,

43
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,940
and it's actually the way you
fight it is by surrendering,

44
00:01:42,941 --> 00:01:43,780
not by fighting,

45
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:48,700
by letting go and sinking into
the actual hum of the universe,

46
00:01:48,701 --> 00:01:49,750
the way it really works,

47
00:01:49,751 --> 00:01:51,010
not the way you wish it work,

48
00:01:51,011 --> 00:01:54,540
not the way that you are hoping
that the universe worked where uh,

49
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:54,941
you know,

50
00:01:54,941 --> 00:01:59,290
lions and hyenas rescue
little boys like air,

51
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:00,760
like an ice age,

52
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,350
but the cartoon.

53
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:03,910
But the way it actually works,

54
00:02:03,911 --> 00:02:07,090
the way the university actually works
as everything comes into existence,

55
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:11,020
it exists for a little
while and then it dies

56
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,410
than most things come out of explosions,

57
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,030
eh?

58
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:14,491
Oh yeah.

59
00:02:14,491 --> 00:02:15,181
Don't forget that.

60
00:02:15,181 --> 00:02:15,331
Yeah.

61
00:02:15,331 --> 00:02:17,520
Most things come out of big fucking blast,

62
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,320
including the whole universe itself.

63
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:19,810
Yes.

64
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:20,010
Right.

65
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:22,710
Whole Universe itself is
predicated upon a violent event.

66
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,400
Yeah.

67
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,720
It has to have a violent event.

68
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,200
Right.

69
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,130
That's big bang.

70
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,400
It couldn't be the slow expansion of
beautiful life giving particles throughout

71
00:02:32,731 --> 00:02:33,570
the universe now,

72
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,050
nope.

73
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:35,430
It's a big fucking bang.

74
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:35,971
No,

75
00:02:35,971 --> 00:02:38,430
it was a big fucking bang and it keeps it,

76
00:02:38,431 --> 00:02:39,570
it keeps going.

77
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,840
The big bank keeps going and is,

78
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,200
but it's just like this,

79
00:02:43,201 --> 00:02:43,470
man.

80
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:48,470
If you want to dig your heels in and sync
your claws into the expanding universe

81
00:02:51,331 --> 00:02:53,910
and try to keep that fucking
thing from expanding,

82
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,410
you're going to get ripped apart.

83
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,910
That's just the way it works.

84
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:00,550
But if you want to let go
and merge into the thing,

85
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:04,090
if you want to allow yourself the fantasy
that you're not some individual with a

86
00:03:04,091 --> 00:03:06,520
social security number
and a name and parents,

87
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:11,790
but allow yourself the fantasy that
you're 13.8 billion years old and you're

88
00:03:11,951 --> 00:03:16,951
part of this incredible ocean of happening
instead of just this one individual,

89
00:03:17,111 --> 00:03:19,540
and just let yourself
experience that for a second.

90
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,020
The glorious knowledge that
you are a never ending,

91
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:28,050
ever changing flow of matter that's
temporarily manifested with the ability to

92
00:03:28,481 --> 00:03:32,380
express love and do a dimension where
things are supposed to be cooling off,

93
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:37,180
then that's a fun way to spend your time
here before you end up getting eaten by

94
00:03:37,181 --> 00:03:40,720
a lion or have a heart
attack or whatever happens.

95
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:41,890
It's just a backflip.

96
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,753
This is uh,

97
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,780
this is like a high dot.

98
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:48,250
This is like when you see people come
off of a high dive and you get like a few

99
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:48,251
seconds.

100
00:03:48,251 --> 00:03:49,810
It's just some cool fucking tricks.

101
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,340
That's what you get here.

102
00:03:51,341 --> 00:03:56,341
We're like dolphins jumping out of the
eternal and we into time and while we

103
00:03:56,491 --> 00:03:57,790
were shoot up into time,

104
00:03:57,791 --> 00:04:00,160
we get a chance to do
a couple of back flips,

105
00:04:00,161 --> 00:04:01,210
a couple of Chirps,

106
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,740
and that's our life's work.

107
00:04:02,741 --> 00:04:04,840
And then we plunged back
into infinity again.

108
00:04:04,841 --> 00:04:05,890
Do it all over again.

109
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,370
It's like if you're creating characters
for fiction and the idea that you can't

110
00:04:10,371 --> 00:04:11,790
create a con,

111
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,970
you know you can't make a slot.

112
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,340
You can't make a girl who's
all fucked up in the head.

113
00:04:16,341 --> 00:04:16,621
Well they,

114
00:04:16,621 --> 00:04:17,840
they exist in life.

115
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,670
Okay.

116
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:19,730
And if you're making fiction,

117
00:04:19,731 --> 00:04:23,420
your fiction doesn't necessarily have to
represent anything other than what's in

118
00:04:23,421 --> 00:04:24,080
your head.

119
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,060
What's the wacky story
you're trying to get out?

120
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,700
You don't have any obligation to
use a certain amount of Asians.

121
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:31,550
You don't have any obligation to use a
certain amount of white people or black

122
00:04:31,551 --> 00:04:32,150
people.

123
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:35,000
Your obligation is to
make something cool up,

124
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:35,840
make it up,

125
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,673
pull it out of your head.

126
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:37,573
Well look,

127
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,650
people are worried about
entertainment like that.

128
00:04:39,651 --> 00:04:40,340
That's a very,

129
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,360
that one I was religious.

130
00:04:41,361 --> 00:04:42,194
That was our,

131
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:42,920
well,

132
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,790
Jehovah's Witness Dude,

133
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:46,800
like every fucking thing
I watched like smart,

134
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:50,060
like a smurfs was off limits for
some fucking bullshit reason.

135
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:50,331
Right.

136
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:51,650
They wouldn't let you watch the SMURFS.

137
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:52,161
Yeah.

138
00:04:52,161 --> 00:04:52,551
I mean,

139
00:04:52,551 --> 00:04:53,390
so what it really,

140
00:04:53,391 --> 00:04:53,811
but there's,

141
00:04:53,811 --> 00:04:56,930
I don't know where there's some demonic
thing with that and it's all these

142
00:04:56,931 --> 00:04:57,351
fucking,

143
00:04:57,351 --> 00:04:57,621
and then,

144
00:04:57,621 --> 00:04:57,731
uh,

145
00:04:57,731 --> 00:04:58,570
I remember the Simpsons,

146
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,810
somebody came in and gave a talk,

147
00:04:59,811 --> 00:05:00,770
brother Tucker,

148
00:05:00,771 --> 00:05:01,604
his name was,

149
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,061
he was like,

150
00:05:02,061 --> 00:05:03,980
the traveling overseer was his title.

151
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:04,760
Right.

152
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,110
And he would come and like
give talks in the congregate.

153
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:08,900
I was in meetings like
three nights a week.

154
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:12,730
So he gave this whole fucking
talk about all the shit that,

155
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,370
like how Iti was bad because he,

156
00:05:15,371 --> 00:05:15,600
yeah,

157
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,600
because he healed the boy and you're like,

158
00:05:17,601 --> 00:05:17,760
you know,

159
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,970
who do we know is the
only person who can heal?

160
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:24,170
Like I might start believing
ut is the real Jesus.

161
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,153
That's the fear.

162
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:30,580
And then the Simpsons had
rebellion against authority
with bar and disrespect of

163
00:05:30,921 --> 00:05:31,790
like your elders.

164
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,950
So that's something I
could hear the mother's,

165
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:34,401
well,

166
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:35,480
I'm not like my kid.

167
00:05:35,481 --> 00:05:35,960
Watch it.

168
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,610
I could hear them chattering after that.

169
00:05:37,611 --> 00:05:39,500
Like that's what this shit is now.

170
00:05:39,501 --> 00:05:40,334
It's like what is,

171
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,610
what's the representation?

172
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:42,680
It's not propaganda.

173
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:43,280
So Shit,

174
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,113
just candy.

175
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:44,720
You know.

176
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,930
So we were talking about
this before the podcast to,

177
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:51,940
do you think that some like overtly upset
PC people that what they're doing is

178
00:05:53,961 --> 00:05:58,961
almost like a form of like protecting
almost like a form of fighting against

179
00:06:00,081 --> 00:06:03,680
blasphemy that like I
remember it goes to my church,

180
00:06:03,681 --> 00:06:05,120
I remember all of them that were like,

181
00:06:05,121 --> 00:06:08,040
oh well you something
like every logistical one,

182
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:09,440
that same behavior.

183
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:11,750
I believe that 100% I think you're right.

184
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,890
You is the exact same thing.

185
00:06:12,891 --> 00:06:13,724
Yeah.

186
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,361
I don't even listen.

187
00:06:14,361 --> 00:06:15,194
I don't even mind them.

188
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,820
As long as you are trying to get me fired,

189
00:06:16,821 --> 00:06:17,460
I don't it,

190
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,830
you can say whatever you know.

191
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:19,850
But if you want to criticize,

192
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:21,650
I'm not against criticism.

193
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:21,950
Right,

194
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:22,220
right.

195
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:22,790
That's fine.

196
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,340
Just do I have to be fired?

197
00:06:24,341 --> 00:06:25,700
Just can we not do that part of it?

198
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:26,331
Well that,

199
00:06:26,331 --> 00:06:26,550
that,

200
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:30,740
that is where you find out like
exactly what kind of people they are.

201
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,750
Like what exactly are
they trying to accomplish?

202
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,990
Are they trying to engage in
discourse with a reasonable person?

203
00:06:35,991 --> 00:06:36,920
You're reasonable guy,

204
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,450
you'll have conversations with people,

205
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:43,040
but that's the thing they
want you instantly labeled
as an unreasonable person

206
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:44,420
who's not to be debated.

207
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:44,931
Well,

208
00:06:44,931 --> 00:06:46,220
you shouldn't even have to bring it up.

209
00:06:46,221 --> 00:06:47,750
You should just know what
the right thing is to do.

210
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:52,280
Remember the Anti Seinfeld Seinfeld,

211
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:53,810
Chris Rock said the same thing,

212
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,081
right?

213
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:54,914
Yeah.

214
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,910
But he's allowed to.

215
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:56,961
Yeah.

216
00:06:56,961 --> 00:07:00,050
That was not an in Seinfeld
comes down and it's like,

217
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:00,261
well,

218
00:07:00,261 --> 00:07:02,780
he's irrelevant and an old man something,

219
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:03,823
which by the way,

220
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,330
that's like saying someone's fat.

221
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:06,523
Yeah.

222
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,360
I don't see the difference
in that common him.

223
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:08,701
Right.

224
00:07:08,701 --> 00:07:08,870
Yeah.

225
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,460
I mean it's diffusing his,

226
00:07:10,461 --> 00:07:12,230
his argument and what he's saying is,

227
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:12,511
you know,

228
00:07:12,511 --> 00:07:16,400
what Jerry Seinfeld was saying was that
the colleges are too PC and they'll call

229
00:07:16,401 --> 00:07:19,070
you on everything with his
daughter of these days.

230
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,130
They don't even know what the fuck these
words mean and what constitutes that.

231
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,460
Right.

232
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,750
And that's exactly right.

233
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,500
That's the,

234
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,690
I don't think that PC ruins comedy.

235
00:07:26,691 --> 00:07:28,250
Like people who are funny are still funny.

236
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,350
It kind of fucks up audiences.

237
00:07:30,351 --> 00:07:31,040
Right?

238
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,270
So we both,

239
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,560
I have the same goals,

240
00:07:33,561 --> 00:07:34,460
one of these PC Beulah.

241
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:37,880
I think people should be more sensitive
to each other and all that shit I do as

242
00:07:37,881 --> 00:07:38,210
well.

243
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:40,540
But their system is not
going to create that.

244
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:43,610
It's just going to create fucking
people that shut down at buzzwords.

245
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,060
Right.

246
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:44,950
So that's not helping.

247
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:45,863
Okay.

248
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:54,890
Okay.
