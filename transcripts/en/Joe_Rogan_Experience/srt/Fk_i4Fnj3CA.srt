1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:05,660
No Freak bitches,
they've got to have two wings of the,

2
00:00:05,661 --> 00:00:07,440
of the psych ward.
They're like one,

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:11,250
like they've got the standard issue
harmful to yourself or others,

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,040
you know,
like committed for the involuntary

5
00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:17,190
psychiatric hold.
Then they've got the,

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,190
the something else,
the extraordinarily,

7
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:21,660
you know,
like,

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,330
uh,
the extraordinarily qualifying

9
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,590
individuals,
you know,

10
00:00:25,591 --> 00:00:28,780
and the something else wing.
So it,

11
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:30,960
so they had me on the something else
swing and like,

12
00:00:30,961 --> 00:00:32,010
whoa.
Yeah.

13
00:00:32,011 --> 00:00:37,011
And like my roommate was like fucking
like hiding in the closet from like in

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,520
demons.
Oh Dude,

15
00:00:38,521 --> 00:00:39,170
it was.
I mean,

16
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:41,850
I've been hearing voices for like a
couple of years,

17
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,540
but nothing like this guy voices say,
Oh,

18
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,170
do you see,
well you're the best,

19
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,173
your cell phone,
your

20
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:58,470
angels and demons,
you know,

21
00:00:58,471 --> 00:01:00,740
like some of them would tell me like,
you're worthless.

22
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,500
He needed to die and I would be like
trying to suffocate myself to death,

23
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:05,690
you know?
Well,

24
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,350
yeah,
I mean not like with anything,

25
00:01:07,351 --> 00:01:08,430
I'm just holding my breath.

26
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:14,950
That was the guy.
Well,

27
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:20,520
but that was the whole thing was I was
hearing voices because I was hopping so

28
00:01:20,521 --> 00:01:23,490
much nitrous oxide.
And while,

29
00:01:23,491 --> 00:01:25,020
um,
while you're doing ketamine,

30
00:01:25,021 --> 00:01:27,450
while I was doing cocaine,
I never smoked this joint.

31
00:01:27,451 --> 00:01:32,451
Just fucking relax.
You make me feel so much better about

32
00:01:35,101 --> 00:01:40,101
myself.
I used to watch it watch intervention so

33
00:01:41,011 --> 00:01:45,510
that I could feel better about myself.
I'm worried about your health more than

34
00:01:45,511 --> 00:01:48,370
I'm worried about like you overdosing.
I'm worried your overall,

35
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:53,890
it's a slow deterioration of your fiber.
Like the stuff that keeps you together,

36
00:01:54,841 --> 00:01:57,330
you're talking to me.
I'm fine now.

37
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,790
I feel like I just worked out for
talking to Steve.

38
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:09,890
I may have been when they said a sign
I'm in something else.

39
00:02:10,271 --> 00:02:12,690
Award like people are not people.
One Guy,

40
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,130
I remember one guy like shit on the
fucking ground and was breakdancing and

41
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:22,150
it like tried to like.
I mean it sounds like I'm making it up.

42
00:02:22,951 --> 00:02:24,540
I swear I'm not dude.
He was in,

43
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:28,670
his goal was to like smear it around
as much as he could.

44
00:02:28,671 --> 00:02:30,240
And this is in the room with,
you know,

45
00:02:30,241 --> 00:02:34,280
that was in the hallway.
It was another dude.

46
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,450
It's break dance.
You go to his own Shimmy.

47
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,970
It looked like his break dancing.
But he was like,

48
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:41,730
he took a shit and he's trying to smear
it around as much as he could and it

49
00:02:41,731 --> 00:02:46,060
just looked like it was break dancing
and that's,

50
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:48,300
you know,
you're talking earlier about like how

51
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:49,830
our culture,
you know,

52
00:02:49,831 --> 00:02:54,831
we repress all this really natural stuff
and make it a problem when it doesn't

53
00:02:54,871 --> 00:02:57,920
need to be a problem.
I've always wondered why that is and I

54
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:00,160
wonder if it has anything to do

55
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:05,160
with our,
our need for innovation and for growth

56
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:12,270
and for productivity and if the idea of
like somehow in suppressing sexuality

57
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:18,310
makes people concentrate on being more
productive and more successful so that

58
00:03:19,781 --> 00:03:24,781
way you can kind of earn sex and if sex
was more free you wouldn't get as much

59
00:03:25,091 --> 00:03:27,310
done.
And I wonder if it's some sort of a

60
00:03:27,311 --> 00:03:32,311
weird work around that.
Almost like I'm the construction of this

61
00:03:33,641 --> 00:03:36,540
advanced civilization as sort of a.
it's like it's,

62
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:40,870
it's invented this path that sort of
ensures productivity.

63
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,760
And one of the best ways to do that is
to make people compete like in a very,

64
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:50,380
very efficient and very ferocious way
for the attention of women.

65
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,930
And if this,
the attention of women was easily

66
00:03:52,931 --> 00:03:55,540
achieved,
there would be less ambition and there

67
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:57,310
would be less.
So in a sense,

68
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:02,610
suppression like leads to more
materialism that leads to a more obvious

69
00:04:04,361 --> 00:04:06,100
expression of materialism.

70
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,890
Like you want the big house,
you want the Nice Watch,

71
00:04:08,891 --> 00:04:13,420
you want the nice shoes,
nice clothes and in wanting all those

72
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:16,060
things,
you want to list things because sex is

73
00:04:16,061 --> 00:04:19,330
like difficult to achieve.
And if sex was easy to achieve,

74
00:04:19,331 --> 00:04:23,140
you'd be a little bit more relaxed and
your needs because like ultimately the

75
00:04:23,141 --> 00:04:26,710
physical needs kind of like trump,
all the other stuff,

76
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:27,910
you know,
I could do you want,

77
00:04:27,911 --> 00:04:29,380
do you want a nice watch?
Yeah,

78
00:04:29,381 --> 00:04:30,610
I mean it's okay.
Why do I want.

79
00:04:30,611 --> 00:04:32,320
And I swatched it will look.
They kind of look cool.

80
00:04:32,321 --> 00:04:33,940
Okay.
But do you want a nice watch?

81
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,130
Because girls are gonna recognize it.
Yeah.

82
00:04:36,131 --> 00:04:38,020
Well girls don't give a shit about a
nice watch.

83
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,430
They just want to suck your Dick.
Wow.

84
00:04:39,431 --> 00:04:40,264
Well fuck that.

85
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:47,160
Well you've just summarized the argument
of Freud's civilization and its

86
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:48,870
discontents reality.
Yeah,

87
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:50,120
that's what he says.
He says,

88
00:04:50,121 --> 00:04:55,121
civilization is the product of a
repressed sexual energy being redirected

89
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:00,420
into productive activities.
Huh?

90
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:01,950
Well,
I've sort of reversed it.

91
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,690
I've reversed it.
Almost like civilization is so weird.

92
00:05:06,691 --> 00:05:07,500
Yeah,
right.

93
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:12,420
Because because it's the result of that
it wants to continue and amplify that

94
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:17,490
like any system wants to persist.
So because it's the result of that than

95
00:05:18,391 --> 00:05:23,391
there are in built in mechanisms for
perpetuating that cycle of repression.

96
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,370
Redirection,
you know,

97
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,380
dangling the carrot.
I mean if,

98
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:32,660
if capitalism could stop us from
breathing and then charge us for air,

99
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:34,450
they would.

100
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:36,940
And you made this one tweet,
which again,

101
00:05:36,941 --> 00:05:41,650
I think it's fairly innocuous.
I actually know completely innocuous.

102
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:46,510
Totally justified.
The first tweet the company you were

103
00:05:46,511 --> 00:05:49,510
working for makes in response to it.
They call you,

104
00:05:49,511 --> 00:05:52,820
they're former community leader.
Was that how you found out you were.

105
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:52,900
You were

106
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,440
fired practically.
So I can run you through the timetable

107
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:57,271
list if you want.
So,

108
00:05:57,271 --> 00:05:58,280
so at the beginning

109
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,840
of the day,
what company was it again?

110
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,381
Oh,
well,

111
00:06:00,381 --> 00:06:02,600
the company that I worked for is called
Turo rock studios.

112
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,770
A bunch of really talented artists who
are making it an incredibly ambitious

113
00:06:06,771 --> 00:06:08,790
game called evolve.
Um,

114
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,290
and so the game was,
the game is and was and still is really

115
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:13,070
awesome.
Um,

116
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,000
but the,
the,

117
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,350
the company,
you know,

118
00:06:15,351 --> 00:06:17,240
gain development,
we work in a slightly different clock

119
00:06:17,241 --> 00:06:18,740
than most of corporate America.
We work,

120
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,400
we go in at like 10:00 AM and we leave
at like 7:00 PM because we're usually up

121
00:06:22,401 --> 00:06:24,050
until really late evening,
late in the evening.

122
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:28,100
So I really don't even wake up until
like 9:00 everyday most days.

123
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:31,730
So that day I woke up and my phone was
buzzing and blowing up.

124
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,110
Uh,
one of my,

125
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:36,080
one of my really close friends and
colleagues at the time texted me and he

126
00:06:36,081 --> 00:06:36,411
was like,
Hey,

127
00:06:36,411 --> 00:06:38,570
by the way,
you know that stuff you tweeted about

128
00:06:38,571 --> 00:06:41,900
the other day,
like some news outlet picked up on it,

129
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:46,901
some small thing and ultra group,
exactly what we wanted to capitalize on

130
00:06:47,571 --> 00:06:48,031
that,
on that,

131
00:06:48,031 --> 00:06:49,220
that sensational headline.

132
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,810
And so he,
he was just giving me a heads up and I

133
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:51,591
was like,
Oh yeah,

134
00:06:51,591 --> 00:06:52,520
you,
no thanks whatever.

135
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,100
To me at the,
at the time I was like,

136
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,340
whatever,
like I know what the group he did,

137
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:59,870
I don't want to name the site but,
but I know what they're about.

138
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,880
They do this all the time.
So I was like,

139
00:07:01,881 --> 00:07:02,970
whatever.
Um,

140
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:07,160
and then so maybe I jumped in the shower
and I get out and I've got texts from

141
00:07:07,161 --> 00:07:09,320
like our gm at our,
at our studio,

142
00:07:09,321 --> 00:07:11,330
like,
you need to go radio dark on all social

143
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:12,870
media period.
And I was like,

144
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:13,971
what?
I was like,

145
00:07:13,971 --> 00:07:16,220
what?
And so I texted him back and I'm like,

146
00:07:16,221 --> 00:07:20,540
is this in relation to the article?
The one article that no one else picked

147
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,080
up on and that like,
um,

148
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,110
you know,
half the comments were like that dude,

149
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:25,310
that's totally not what Josh was saying.

150
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:27,920
And the other half were kind of reacting
sensationally to it.

151
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,160
But like the other half you've been on
the common to the Oracle,

152
00:07:30,161 --> 00:07:32,000
we're like,
you're taking them out of context.

153
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,170
And that was the entire extent of the
controversy circling me at the time.

154
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,740
Um,
and then 45 minutes later I still have

155
00:07:39,741 --> 00:07:42,650
even left my apartment to go into the
studio yet 45 minutes later my email

156
00:07:42,651 --> 00:07:44,000
stops working and I'm like,
oh,

157
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:44,961
like,
I'm not dumb,

158
00:07:44,961 --> 00:07:45,800
I'm not stupid.
I'm like,

159
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:48,920
they literally just shut off my email.
Um,

160
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,130
and then so I tried calling him and he
didn't take my call and then an hour

161
00:07:52,131 --> 00:07:53,120
later he's like,
yeah,

162
00:07:53,121 --> 00:07:54,310
we should,
we should probably meet at like the

163
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,030
starbucks around the corner.
And I was like,

164
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,670
what?
Like you don't even want me to come into

165
00:07:58,671 --> 00:08:02,000
the office and talk about this.
Like you don't want to hear my side of

166
00:08:02,001 --> 00:08:03,860
it,
you don't want to see what's,

167
00:08:03,861 --> 00:08:05,630
what,
like it's just done.

168
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:09,440
And then they issued the statement that
they made which was like the literally

169
00:08:09,441 --> 00:08:12,260
putting the match to the kerosene.
So maybe there was some kerosene,

170
00:08:12,261 --> 00:08:14,870
maybe there was some potential for
outrage.

171
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,920
And then when they fired me it turned
into this huge thing in the gaming

172
00:08:18,921 --> 00:08:21,020
industry around like,
was that right?

173
00:08:21,021 --> 00:08:22,590
Was that wrong?
So like the,

174
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,460
the vast majority of people who had
never even heard about that or even

175
00:08:25,461 --> 00:08:29,450
would've cared that I tweeted that.
I'm kind of like everybody heard about

176
00:08:29,451 --> 00:08:30,110
it.
Um,

177
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,310
mainstream,
heard about it.

178
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:33,020
Like Mark Cuban started following me on
twitter.

179
00:08:33,021 --> 00:08:35,180
Like if you were,
if they were afraid the NBA was going to

180
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,400
get pissed at us for me for weighing in
on it,

181
00:08:37,401 --> 00:08:39,800
then you know,
they're kind of reaction to it made it

182
00:08:39,801 --> 00:08:41,810
like 50 times worse.
Yeah.

183
00:08:41,811 --> 00:08:42,770
I wish I was.
