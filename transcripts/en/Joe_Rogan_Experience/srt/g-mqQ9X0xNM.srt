1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,380
The Joe Rogan experience
was a bad motherfucker.

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:04,520
Very bad motherfucker.

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,800
He barely made any lemons.

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:07,970
Really?

5
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:08,271
Yeah.

6
00:00:08,271 --> 00:00:08,511
I mean,

7
00:00:08,511 --> 00:00:09,690
think about the shitty movies I,

8
00:00:09,691 --> 00:00:10,524
Paul Newman made.

9
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:11,900
I really can't.

10
00:00:11,901 --> 00:00:13,340
I can't come up with one.

11
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:13,900
You know,

12
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:14,810
I can't come up with.

13
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:17,330
I'm not familiar enough
with his entire catalog.

14
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:20,120
I remember stallone did the
comedy movie with his mother.

15
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:21,111
Oh,

16
00:00:21,111 --> 00:00:23,120
it was a throw momma from the train.

17
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,310
Was that it was another one?

18
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:25,470
No,

19
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:25,581
no,

20
00:00:25,581 --> 00:00:25,681
no,

21
00:00:25,681 --> 00:00:25,791
no,

22
00:00:25,791 --> 00:00:25,971
no.

23
00:00:25,971 --> 00:00:26,930
This was um,

24
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:27,830
what was it called?

25
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,520
A.

26
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,660
This is going to drive me fucking nuts.

27
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,393
I'm.

28
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:32,413
Oh,

29
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:35,840
it wasn't at the same woman that was in
golden girls that played the old woman,

30
00:00:35,841 --> 00:00:36,950
but she had brown hair.

31
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:37,201
Oh,

32
00:00:37,201 --> 00:00:38,370
this is going to drive me nuts.

33
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:39,830
I don't know your Old Lady Trivia.

34
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:42,960
How do you know that?

35
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:43,411
I don't know.

36
00:00:43,411 --> 00:00:44,310
It seems like I remember it.

37
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:44,431
Well.

38
00:00:44,431 --> 00:00:45,231
Let's just look up.

39
00:00:45,231 --> 00:00:47,340
Still owns the loan listening

40
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,033
Oscar.

41
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:53,551
It was,

42
00:00:53,551 --> 00:00:54,061
it was asking.

43
00:00:54,061 --> 00:00:55,530
Oscar was one.

44
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,080
Let's see.

45
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,460
That's the one that I'm thinking of.

46
00:00:59,520 --> 00:00:59,851
Yeah.

47
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:02,280
Well he definitely had one called Oscar.

48
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,830
That's the one I was thinking you were
thinking fuckers done mama from the

49
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,673
train,

50
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,960
but it wasn't thermometer from
trying to throw my of a train.

51
00:01:09,961 --> 00:01:12,710
Was that old gross lady from like
goonies or something like that?

52
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:12,951
Oh,

53
00:01:12,951 --> 00:01:13,670
the fatality.

54
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:16,080
My mom will shoot stop where my mom was.

55
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,120
So he did two comedies in a row.

56
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:22,240
He did Oscar and then he did
stop or my mom will shoot.

57
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:25,270
That's how retarded people
were in the nineties though.

58
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,140
Like you know what?

59
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:28,060
Forget all these great comedians we have.

60
00:01:28,061 --> 00:01:29,830
We need to get the loan up there.

61
00:01:29,831 --> 00:01:30,970
They just kept giving them money.

62
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,010
My Old Lady Trivia,

63
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:32,481
look at this.

64
00:01:32,481 --> 00:01:37,481
It was the old lady Estelle Getty
from older girls with brown hair.

65
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,230
That's so crazy.

66
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:40,251
And look at him.

67
00:01:40,251 --> 00:01:40,500
He's like,

68
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,400
I can't believe.

69
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,970
What are you doing with that gun

70
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:47,860
for a second?

71
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,650
Look at the look on his face,

72
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:50,484
man.

73
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,450
Can't believe this.

74
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:57,460
Look a little my gun it or
has it been confirmed and or,

75
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:58,561
or like,

76
00:01:58,561 --> 00:02:03,550
like completely confirmed that he
actually started out doing porn is because

77
00:02:03,551 --> 00:02:04,300
that's.

78
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:04,600
Yeah,

79
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,320
he did a movie and it
wasn't like it was softcore.

80
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,090
Yeah,

81
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,440
so he wasn't like laying
pipe on film or anything,

82
00:02:11,441 --> 00:02:12,970
so it might've been,

83
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,230
might've been laying pipe,

84
00:02:14,231 --> 00:02:16,240
but I'm pretty sure they
didn't show it if he was,

85
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:20,350
I think it was like an angle thing and
they wanted to sell it to them for a

86
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:20,351
million dollars.

87
00:02:20,351 --> 00:02:20,591
It was like,

88
00:02:20,591 --> 00:02:22,970
it wouldn't give you 10
sensitive business shifts.

89
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:27,853
Budget.

90
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:30,181
Yeah.

91
00:02:30,181 --> 00:02:32,070
Well that's that same thing man.

92
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:34,110
That's that thing of like wanting to win.

93
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:35,400
Like I was.

94
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,660
I went to eat dinner at this bar and I
was sitting next to this lady and you

95
00:02:39,661 --> 00:02:39,800
know,

96
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,740
like sometimes you're sitting next to
somebody and you can tell they have some.

97
00:02:43,741 --> 00:02:43,950
They,

98
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:44,460
they,

99
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,060
they're,

100
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,280
they're having a problem
in life or something.

101
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:47,500
You,

102
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,320
you either kind of looking for help.

103
00:02:49,321 --> 00:02:51,210
Sometimes you get around people
and you can just feel it.

104
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:51,620
They,

105
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,960
they're lost or they want something and
like I'm just sitting there eating and

106
00:02:54,961 --> 00:02:56,130
she starts talking to me.

107
00:02:56,131 --> 00:02:56,491
Right.

108
00:02:56,491 --> 00:03:01,491
And then right away she's goes into
talking about how her sister was getting

109
00:03:01,871 --> 00:03:06,871
married and her sister invited her up
to big Sur to go to the wedding and got

110
00:03:07,841 --> 00:03:07,931
there.

111
00:03:07,931 --> 00:03:11,050
And there was nowhere
to stay and her sister,

112
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,360
her steps or her sister in law is a bitch.

113
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,060
That was the story she was telling.

114
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:18,820
But when you're looking at
someone who's like caught,

115
00:03:18,821 --> 00:03:21,760
that's just one little piece
of the puzzle for them.

116
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:25,000
They're locked into this
world view of fighting.

117
00:03:25,001 --> 00:03:29,590
They're constantly on the offensive
trying to like poke back at the world and

118
00:03:29,591 --> 00:03:32,080
that's the one little symbol
of the thing that she could,

119
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,250
she could give me.

120
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:37,480
But then she said something shitty to
the bartender and then she like said

121
00:03:37,481 --> 00:03:38,650
something shitty to somebody else.

122
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:39,040
You realize like,

123
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:39,191
oh,

124
00:03:39,191 --> 00:03:43,870
this person just going through the world
trying to shake every living part of

125
00:03:43,871 --> 00:03:44,321
the world.

126
00:03:44,321 --> 00:03:46,630
She wants to cut and Shank and hurt.

127
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:47,890
She's shut down.

128
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,810
But inside of her,

129
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,220
because that's what I recognize.

130
00:03:51,221 --> 00:03:51,461
I'm like,

131
00:03:51,461 --> 00:03:51,791
shit,

132
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:52,624
this is like an.

133
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:56,740
Sometimes the cruelest sort of person
is someone who started off trying to be

134
00:03:56,741 --> 00:03:59,890
nice and then got shut down
for being nice sometimes.

135
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:00,340
Yeah.

136
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,380
And I could see all this
used to be a very sweet,

137
00:04:02,381 --> 00:04:03,214
nice person.

138
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,120
So I said to her,

139
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:04,651
you know what?

140
00:04:04,651 --> 00:04:05,411
You should start doing,

141
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:09,700
you should start doing service work
or missionary work and she's like,

142
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:11,560
I used to do that.

143
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,551
I used to do that.

144
00:04:12,551 --> 00:04:14,650
I spent years doing that and she was,

145
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,920
it was like I could see that part of her,

146
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:18,311
you know,

147
00:04:18,311 --> 00:04:21,820
and then I could see she thought that
by doing good things in the world,

148
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,980
she should get some reward for it,

149
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,170
but instead of getting a reward for it,

150
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,280
she got hurt,

151
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:30,640
whatever it was that happened during
the course of her serving the universe,

152
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:34,900
she got less of what she wanted or didn't
get what she expected and because of

153
00:04:34,901 --> 00:04:35,051
that,

154
00:04:35,051 --> 00:04:35,411
she's like,

155
00:04:35,411 --> 00:04:36,244
fuck it,

156
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:40,930
I'm going to be a bitch from now on
because I tried to be good and I got

157
00:04:40,931 --> 00:04:42,410
punished for it.

158
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:46,240
My wife has a friend that's
religious and her and her friend,

159
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:50,530
her and this other friend were going to.

160
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,660
This woman in her other friend were going
to get like a real estate license and

161
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:58,540
she didn't get it and she passed.

162
00:04:58,541 --> 00:04:59,440
She failed her test,

163
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:03,190
but her friend passed and she was
complaining about it and the what she was

164
00:05:03,191 --> 00:05:03,881
complaining about.

165
00:05:03,881 --> 00:05:04,570
She goes,

166
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:05,403
I don't get it.

167
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,580
I'm a good person.

168
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:07,810
Yes,

169
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:08,643
why didn't?

170
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,360
Why didn't God hook me up with this?

171
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:11,550
And she literally said that.

172
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,730
That's it right there.

173
00:05:12,731 --> 00:05:12,941
See,

174
00:05:12,941 --> 00:05:17,890
that is the great fallacy of being a
good person is the moment you start doing

175
00:05:17,891 --> 00:05:18,011
it,

176
00:05:18,011 --> 00:05:18,821
being a good person,

177
00:05:18,821 --> 00:05:19,654
as a job,

178
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,260
and you're supposed to get these fortune
paychecks from the universe in the form

179
00:05:23,261 --> 00:05:25,000
of luck or good things coming to you.

180
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,890
That's the moment you fail.

181
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:27,970
You fail.

182
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:31,630
You really have to resign yourself to
the idea that mostly if you're being nice

183
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:32,350
to people,

184
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,390
they're going to hurt you.

185
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:34,723
First of all,

186
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:38,490
there's an unbelievable amount of pressure
as an artist after not having a show

187
00:05:38,491 --> 00:05:39,324
in four years to,

188
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:39,740
you know,

189
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:44,330
every time I do a show I want it to be
the best show I've ever done and this was

190
00:05:44,331 --> 00:05:48,290
like such a small amount of time to
put that much art together that I was,

191
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:48,980
you know,

192
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:49,401
everyone's like,

193
00:05:49,401 --> 00:05:50,750
you fucking bitches in Mexico.

194
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:51,350
I'm like,

195
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,183
I'm working.

196
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:52,761
I'm not.

197
00:05:52,761 --> 00:05:54,650
I didn't go to Mexico to fuck you know,

198
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,020
but you have a very strange way of,

199
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,093
fuck.

200
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,870
How do I say it's very bold.

201
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,560
Oh really?

202
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,380
It's like bravado to it.

203
00:06:03,381 --> 00:06:04,400
Like you're wearing a cape.

204
00:06:04,401 --> 00:06:06,800
I didn't go to Mexico to like,

205
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,750
you're confident way saying,

206
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,440
fuck,

207
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:09,861
why do I,

208
00:06:09,861 --> 00:06:10,551
what do I like to do?

209
00:06:10,551 --> 00:06:11,384
Fuck.

210
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:13,260
Just like,

211
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,310
it's like you're almost
defiant in your tone.

212
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,810
So I got to tell you what happened.

213
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:18,170
I,

214
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,003
uh,

215
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,130
you know,

216
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,110
because every.

217
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,980
I'm going to go off subject just
for a second because no way.

218
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,900
Every time on the show,

219
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,070
every time I think,

220
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:29,180
wow,

221
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,890
I've experienced a new sexual
thing that I've never like,

222
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:32,750
this is insane.

223
00:06:32,751 --> 00:06:35,720
Like how many are left when
a girl's shoots the ice cube?

224
00:06:35,721 --> 00:06:36,554
My butthole or,

225
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:37,923
or,

226
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:39,250
or,

227
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:39,741
you know,

228
00:06:39,741 --> 00:06:40,574
like,

229
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:44,870
or like when I'm laying down and then
like five women or just giving me a

230
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:45,291
massage,

231
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:46,400
just using their tongues.

232
00:06:46,401 --> 00:06:47,234
I'm like five.

233
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,860
It's not going to get better than this.

234
00:06:48,861 --> 00:06:49,240
You know,

235
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,270
like this is like,

236
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:51,290
he doesn't like a baller.

237
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:51,771
Damn.

238
00:06:51,771 --> 00:06:53,600
I didn't even know who it
went to over two handed.

239
00:06:53,601 --> 00:06:54,770
I thought it just stopped there.

240
00:06:54,771 --> 00:06:55,604
You'd have five.

241
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:56,061
And then.

242
00:06:56,061 --> 00:06:57,980
So I meet a guy yesterday and he's like,

243
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:58,371
Oh yeah,

244
00:06:58,371 --> 00:07:00,290
we did some red rope
shit and this and that,

245
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:01,120
and I'm like,

246
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:01,670
I'm like,

247
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:02,030
I don't,

248
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:02,641
I don't know what that is,

249
00:07:02,641 --> 00:07:06,200
is like you don't know
what a red rope services.

250
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,273
And I go,

251
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:07,791
no,

252
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:09,110
but please tell me like,

253
00:07:09,111 --> 00:07:10,700
what the fuck are you
talking about right now?

254
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:14,240
My name is Marty and I'm the
inventor of the red rope service.

255
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,950
So honestly sitting there.

256
00:07:15,951 --> 00:07:16,251
Okay.

257
00:07:16,251 --> 00:07:18,050
So you're laying on your
bitsa massage parlor.

258
00:07:18,051 --> 00:07:18,410
You Go,

259
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:19,520
it's a service.

260
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:21,320
It's not the name of a place,

261
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,580
like a code word you can we get.

262
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:24,740
Can I get the red rope?

263
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:25,520
Okay.

264
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,210
So you're getting a massage and I think
it's only an Asia and you're laying on

265
00:07:29,211 --> 00:07:30,860
your back and then you go,

266
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:31,781
you know,

267
00:07:31,781 --> 00:07:32,350
you get the,

268
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:35,150
you get to the happy ending point where
she gets her dick hard and everything

269
00:07:35,151 --> 00:07:35,984
and you're like,

270
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:38,690
I would like the red rope at this point.

271
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,120
She ties a rope and here's the crazy part.

272
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,080
It doesn't have to be read,

273
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:45,140
it's just the rope and they
tie it to the whatever.

274
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:49,730
The bars above the massage table and
they hook their feet on it so they're

275
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:54,740
upside down and so they start spinning
around and then they put their mouth on

276
00:07:54,771 --> 00:07:59,510
your hard Dick and then they let go and
they helicopter their mouth around your

277
00:07:59,511 --> 00:08:01,070
Dick all the way.

278
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,690
And I'd never done it before,

279
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:04,820
but the guy says it feels like
your Dick's going to like,

280
00:08:04,821 --> 00:08:06,890
you've never felt anything
like that before in your life.

281
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:10,830
And it feels like your Dick is
just going to explode with a,

282
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:11,330
you know,

283
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:12,980
like a neutron bomb,

284
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:14,670
the explosion and then you.

285
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,850
And then it's done and it stops.

286
00:08:16,851 --> 00:08:21,620
And then it spins the other way
around to listen to the crafty.

287
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,980
Always unbelievable because they,

288
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,790
they really like take
sex to another level.

289
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:32,870
Like they try to figure out the most
pleasurable things to do to you and then

290
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:33,441
they do them.

291
00:08:33,441 --> 00:08:34,274
You know,

292
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:03,760
you're a fucking human being.
