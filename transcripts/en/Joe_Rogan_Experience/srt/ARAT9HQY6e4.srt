1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,920
Here we go. Four, three, two,

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:12,190
boom. George Lockhart, John Kavanagh,
how white folks those sir. Great.

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,770
Good to see you. Good to be
here. Um, so Saturday night,

4
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,580
what are your thoughts now that we're
sitting here? It's Monday morning.

5
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:26,150
The Khabib Mcgregor fight went down
Saturday night and obviously hugely

6
00:00:27,121 --> 00:00:31,560
disappointed. Yeah. You can
get the results from the
night. I still enjoyed it.

7
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:34,320
I tell it was a great fun. I'm looking
forward to watching it back many times.

8
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:35,671
All the corners fights.

9
00:00:35,671 --> 00:00:39,150
I always pull it out of the lessons
away that I can pass it on to the next

10
00:00:39,151 --> 00:00:41,220
generation of guys.
But yeah,

11
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,180
overall I really enjoyed the fight and
I'm devastated that we didn't get there.

12
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:49,770
Yeah. How much time did he have
to prepare for this fight? Um,

13
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:52,280
I mean he's always in the gym. He's
always, he's always knocking about,

14
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:55,730
but I guess it was official a 10 weeks,
10 weeks out.

15
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:58,980
But even since the 85 I kind of knew,

16
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,490
or at least I taught this next MMA fight,
would be happy to just,

17
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,540
just kind of made sense if it
wasn't going to be the Diaz.

18
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:09,600
But then as time went on that
that seemed less and less likely.

19
00:01:09,601 --> 00:01:13,080
And Habib obviously he was doing
great, you know, kept on winning.

20
00:01:13,081 --> 00:01:16,350
So where is it a pot that
was going to collide?

21
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:20,940
Was there anything that was
surprising in the fight? Um,

22
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:24,750
the, the, the right hand and the second
round was, it was a cracker was beautiful.

23
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:27,330
Overhung right. I mean it's
a, it's a staple of wrestlers,

24
00:01:27,331 --> 00:01:28,170
overhand right and close,

25
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:31,710
but he doesn't generally do
like more job and then close.

26
00:01:31,711 --> 00:01:33,330
But that was a great shot.

27
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:38,250
And this style of takedowns
everything was planned out,

28
00:01:38,251 --> 00:01:42,630
what we expected. And we spent a lot
of time in preparing for that. Um,

29
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,780
yeah, just I, I, you know,

30
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:50,880
kind of expected round warm for sure.
Going to get a take down.

31
00:01:50,881 --> 00:01:55,440
So the goal of round wound was to get
out of it. It's still having energy.

32
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,990
We do month to put a huge amount of
effort into trying to get back open room

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,790
warm.

34
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:03,270
We've seen that happen many times in his
or her opponents and to kind of go back

35
00:02:03,271 --> 00:02:07,350
to the stool, you know, really tired.
So ran one, make them pay, you know,

36
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,470
do our best on the way in
fight as hard as we can.

37
00:02:10,471 --> 00:02:13,560
But if we do end up down in
which it was against the fence,

38
00:02:13,561 --> 00:02:17,330
figured it would be there and tried to
stay seized up. If we end up in our back,

39
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,100
just tried to play guard until,
until it, until the Bell,

40
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:21,990
except it will be a ten nine round

41
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,460
for round two again,
same,

42
00:02:26,461 --> 00:02:29,130
same plan and do as much damage as we can.

43
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,750
But we ended up on our back at don't put
a huge amount of effort and trying to

44
00:02:33,751 --> 00:02:35,340
get up.
He's an absolute master,

45
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:40,110
a regrounding people and that turned
out to be a ten eight round. You know,

46
00:02:40,111 --> 00:02:43,350
he got some good shots there and obviously
he landed the greater right hand.

47
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:48,000
So that was a bit more than we hoped for.
Ronald treating started kind,

48
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:52,080
turning it a little bit in our favor
and we did a lot better at keeping it in

49
00:02:52,081 --> 00:02:56,240
the middle. Defending the takedowns to
the plan was to slow him down a little.

50
00:02:56,241 --> 00:02:59,140
I would watch him slow down a little bit.
And the third, fourth and fifth. Yeah,

51
00:02:59,141 --> 00:02:59,811
exactly.
Yeah.

52
00:02:59,811 --> 00:03:04,811
So I think I at the beginning to the
consensus was conex amount in the first or

53
00:03:05,751 --> 00:03:09,510
her be, you know, takes over
from to on like first the wind,

54
00:03:09,511 --> 00:03:13,630
the third round was probably a bit of
a surprise to people. But um, you know,

55
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,500
you know, dollar acquaint, the fight,
if you look at that for mountain freon,

56
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:21,410
he wasn't able to hit any take
downs. Um, so hoped that we have,

57
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,390
we'll go around tree,

58
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:26,320
we could defend the takedowns a lot
easier and start landing air shots and,

59
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:28,300
and that did happen for round tree,

60
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:31,360
not as well as I as we
plan as well as we hoped.

61
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:36,270
And then a around for, you know, we
hit another great takedown. [inaudible]

62
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:38,920
made a mistake giving up the over hook,
exposed our back.

63
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,260
And that was all she wrote.
Yeah.

64
00:03:41,261 --> 00:03:46,090
He has such a unique ability to tie
both legs up with his legs. Yeah.

65
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:50,530
So I'm around one, I thought cognitive,
well, we practice for that, for a,

66
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:52,810
to keep our legs bent.
You know,

67
00:03:52,811 --> 00:03:54,490
you see guys who straighten
their legs and then from,

68
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,290
and Connor did do that a couple of times,

69
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:58,810
but he was able to
continuously get a leg free.

70
00:03:58,811 --> 00:04:02,740
So not until the last 30
seconds or so around one.

71
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,820
He didn't really tie them up and get
him flat on his back for the majority of

72
00:04:06,821 --> 00:04:10,990
that he was against the fence, you
know, used his hands to keep upright.

73
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:16,240
Tried to learn a little
shots. Um, yeah. And George,

74
00:04:16,241 --> 00:04:19,660
you, uh, you dealt with
Connors, wait, cut.

75
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:22,030
You deal with this
overall nutrition as well?

76
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,130
Yes sir.
Pull that microphone calls.

77
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:28,810
Do you like that you can move it up if
you want to be where you were taking?

78
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,750
Hey guys, it's a, it's a
work in progress. You, uh,

79
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:33,690
you work with them on his weight cut.
Like what,

80
00:04:33,691 --> 00:04:36,730
what was his weight before he
started camp? Um, you know,

81
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,980
it's almost exactly the same way.
Uh,

82
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,570
it was when we actually
started the cut. Um, you know,

83
00:04:43,571 --> 00:04:47,110
we want to make sure that his way was
a little higher than, uh, you know,

84
00:04:47,111 --> 00:04:50,710
obviously with the boxing, with
Floyd, you know, speed is everything.

85
00:04:50,711 --> 00:04:55,300
And we wanted to kind of slowly
drop that way down, but with this,

86
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:58,660
want to keep them as big as possible
and then we'll cut all that weight so he

87
00:04:58,661 --> 00:05:03,250
can, what was his weight? He was about
one 71 when he got back from to that cage.

88
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,970
So. So what was his weight when
you to start started camp? Uh,

89
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,700
about that same thing? Same
thing. Exact same thing. Yeah.

90
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:14,210
It was all about extreme
way. Cut. No pounds. Yeah.

91
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:16,630
In terms of cutting,
it was an easy day.

92
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:19,900
What's the most you've ever had
someone cut? Um, so you know,

93
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,820
on record with drew Dover,

94
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:26,230
he showed up at one 85 on Tuesday
and had to make one 55 by Friday.

95
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:30,130
So 90% of his body weight that we had it.
Yeah.

96
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:34,990
That's the biggest one. Biggest
one on record. He's a big fellow.

97
00:05:34,991 --> 00:05:38,350
I've always looked at drew dober and go,
how the fuck is that guy? Make one 55,

98
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,830
right? No. Every time I see him
I'm like, you know, yeah, you're,

99
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,880
you're making me work my, you
know, we're from my money. Yeah.

100
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:49,840
Well it seems like it's probably not the
healthiest thing in the world for him

101
00:05:49,841 --> 00:05:53,380
to do either. No, I mean, I'll
never, I'll never be like, you know,

102
00:05:53,381 --> 00:05:56,770
weight cutting is the easiest thing in
the world. But I will say that like,

103
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,370
because the amount of muscle mass,

104
00:05:58,371 --> 00:06:00,790
people look at somebody like
him and they're like, mommy,

105
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,260
he doesn't have a lot to lose and
he doesn't have a lot to lose,

106
00:06:03,261 --> 00:06:07,460
but he's got a lot to cut. A
muscle is about seven, you know,

107
00:06:07,461 --> 00:06:10,070
muscle tissues about 79% water,
so more,

108
00:06:10,071 --> 00:06:13,250
and most of you have the more
water you can cut, you know,

109
00:06:13,251 --> 00:06:16,250
so if you do it properly, uh,
the more most of you have,

110
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:18,830
the easier it is for that cut.
And that's why he's able to do that.

111
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,880
How did you learn how to do this?
Honestly, man, I'm like, I'm,

112
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,820
I can be like, well, I got this
degree and I got this degree,

113
00:06:25,821 --> 00:06:27,800
but there's no degree in actual
weight cutting. You know,

114
00:06:27,801 --> 00:06:30,780
I started in the Marine Corps and, uh, uh,

115
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:33,800
I was a heavyweight when I started
fighting and then I ended up as a

116
00:06:33,801 --> 00:06:37,730
welterweight and, um, wow. Yeah, yeah.

117
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,200
It didn't do so well as a welter weight.

118
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:42,870
Kind of the opposite of Anthony Rumble
Johnson. Right, right. You know,

119
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:46,640
it's definitely not, uh, it wasn't,
it didn't work out well for me.

120
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,910
I was better at cutting the weight
then I was actually at fighting.

121
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,170
But I'm learning through this
process, okay, this, this,

122
00:06:54,171 --> 00:06:57,170
this works like this and this works
like this. And there's, I mean,

123
00:06:57,171 --> 00:07:01,040
there's so many studies, uh,
the route there, you know,

124
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:04,500
like you look at the NSCA,
you look at, you know, uh, uh,

125
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,430
pub med and all these other things.
You,

126
00:07:06,431 --> 00:07:08,960
you see a study over here and you see
a over here and you're like, okay,

127
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:13,961
well we're going to put these two together
and actually see in terms of actual

128
00:07:14,061 --> 00:07:15,150
weight cutting it,
it's,

129
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:20,190
it's rough because nobody's ever actually
going to do a study with the level of

130
00:07:20,811 --> 00:07:24,500
dehydration that these guys are
doing. You're like, oh yeah, this,

131
00:07:24,501 --> 00:07:29,390
this how you rehydrate these people. It's
never, it's never going to happen. So,

132
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:32,770
you know, luckily we've, uh, you
know, the amount of cuts that we did,

133
00:07:32,771 --> 00:07:37,670
we work with over 200 UFC fighters. And
just, just, I mean, just in UFC, I mean,

134
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,300
obviously we work with a lot more like
a bill tours, stuff like that. But, uh,

135
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,900
being able to see that, okay,
this works, this doesn't work.

136
00:07:44,901 --> 00:07:47,360
We need a kind of bankers.
And you say you work with them.

137
00:07:47,361 --> 00:07:51,660
If you work with 200 fighters, how hands
on are you with 200 different fighters?

138
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:56,270
Um, it changes, you know,
based on, um, you know, how,

139
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,820
how much they need us. You
know, a lot of the guys,

140
00:07:58,821 --> 00:08:02,240
we literally don't show up until
the week of the fight. You know,

141
00:08:02,241 --> 00:08:06,320
somebody like Connor, you know,
I'm out there six to eight weeks,

142
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:09,590
I'm out there and monitor and
everything and um, you know,

143
00:08:09,591 --> 00:08:12,320
the people that we are out
there for, for, for eight weeks,

144
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,960
it makes life a lot easier.

145
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:18,740
You do you have anything to do
with his meal planning as well?

146
00:08:18,741 --> 00:08:22,420
Like during the camp corner? A
hundred percent, hundred percent.

147
00:08:22,421 --> 00:08:25,940
And that goes into his mouth.
I'm, I'm, I'm monitoring like,

148
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:28,940
so from the moment you guys
start in camp hundred percent.

149
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:33,880
What about outside of camp? Does he
taking instruction from you? Yeah,

150
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:36,570
corner. You know, he needed
me and be like, Hey, I'm
doing this, you know, like a,

151
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:40,280
in terms of like workout, that's a big one
for him. Like, oh, they're pre workout,

152
00:08:40,281 --> 00:08:42,260
post workout. Well,
what should I be taking?

153
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:46,070
I tell him exactly what he should
be taken. And then, um, you know,

154
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:50,360
basically stays on a regimen.
And I think Damien like diet,

155
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:53,780
the word Diet means Fujita habitual way.
And uh,

156
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:58,080
I liked guys to actually live life a
little bit, you know what I'm saying?

157
00:08:58,081 --> 00:09:00,620
And when you're, when you're so
regimented, like, okay, I gotta,

158
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:05,040
I gotta count this car, but I got to count
this. And again, it's, it's ridiculous.

159
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:08,850
You know what I'm saying? So, you know,
the fact that he actually is like, okay,

160
00:09:08,851 --> 00:09:11,490
I just, I just need a monitor
what I'm taking pre, post workout.

161
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:13,230
It makes life easy for me.

162
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:18,090
Did you go to school for nutrition
or even in the Marine Corps?

163
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:21,900
I was a combat conditioning specialist.
I was actually instructor trainer.

164
00:09:21,901 --> 00:09:24,390
So like, um, when you go,

165
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:28,140
there's this place called martial arts
center of excellence. Right. And, uh,

166
00:09:28,141 --> 00:09:31,110
they actually hand picked marines,
um,

167
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:38,490
kinda been through, you know, like in, you
know, certain situations in the military.

168
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:42,890
Uh, Brian Stan was a, was actually,
you know, a part of that. And then, uh,

169
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:48,060
they actually started something called
the combat conditioning program.

170
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,340
And I was actually the,
the,

171
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:53,160
the guy that they actually
had to teach all that.

172
00:09:53,161 --> 00:09:56,940
So they sent me everywhere, like
a, I got to work with the, uh,

173
00:09:56,941 --> 00:10:00,600
the people from the
Olympic training center.

174
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:05,080
I get to work with a Pi and a
Florida, you know, like, um,

175
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:08,430
just learn from a lot of different people.
But in terms of like,

176
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,600
I will say this from weight
cut and there's actually not a,

177
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:14,560
like there's not a course, like if you're
a Dietitian or whatever, that's good.

178
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:18,490
That's great. But that doesn't help
you with in terms of weekend, right?

179
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,960
You go to somebody who's like, hey man,
I'm going to lose 30 pounds in three days.

180
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,440
What do I do?
You know,

181
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:25,320
it's a very specific kind of discipline.

182
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,580
So it's something that you kind of have
to learn along the way and no one's

183
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:32,250
going to teach you in a school 100%.
You do have a back,

184
00:10:32,251 --> 00:10:35,970
some sort of background in nutrition.
Oh, 100%. Yeah, absolutely.

185
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:37,441
Does,

186
00:10:37,441 --> 00:10:42,441
do you vary your diets based on the way
guys train or is it like pretty standard

187
00:10:43,441 --> 00:10:46,560
or does it vary depending on how
much weight they have to lose?

188
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:49,800
Every diet is different. Like, I mean,

189
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,460
people like themselves never
get the same diet twice, uh,

190
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:56,220
the same person.
Um,

191
00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:00,060
so like if you wake up at six o'clock in
the morning versus eight o'clock in the

192
00:11:00,061 --> 00:11:02,730
morning, you have to have a totally
different diet. You don't like,

193
00:11:02,731 --> 00:11:05,190
we feed people from the moment
they wake up to the moment.

194
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,331
What would be the dose?

195
00:11:06,331 --> 00:11:08,930
Say someone likes to get up at six o'clock
in the morning versus someone let's

196
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:13,540
get it up at eight. Would it be in
what time they have to train that?

197
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:15,910
Would that be the, the
variables one variable? Well,

198
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:19,110
we base everything off
tight, uh, tight timing,

199
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:22,860
portion size or homeowner responses of
foods. You know what I'm saying? Like, uh,

200
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:28,400
uh, most diets nowadays, they
actually, you know, they, they,

201
00:11:28,401 --> 00:11:31,890
they kind of stick to one
aspect like Atkins Diet.

202
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:36,870
It sticks the types of foods, you
know, like a zone diet is portion size.

203
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:41,700
We actually stick to all of them, you
know, like type timing, portion size,

204
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:46,110
women responsible. Because, you
know, if you look at all diets,

205
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:49,650
they all work. All diets will
work. You know, like if you're,

206
00:11:49,651 --> 00:11:51,540
if you're consistent to every single diet,

207
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:54,440
if you do the same thing every
single day, you, you're sick,

208
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,450
you're going to see results.

209
00:11:56,230 --> 00:12:00,310
But are you going to get to a specific
weight and is your performance going to

210
00:12:00,311 --> 00:12:04,450
be, Eh, you know, increased
over a fight camp, you know,

211
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,600
that that's when nutrition becomes,
you know,

212
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,120
v extremely valuable.

213
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:12,520
What would be the difference between
someone getting up at six and someone

214
00:12:12,521 --> 00:12:16,360
getting up an eight time they eat? You
know, so if somebody wakes up at six,

215
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:18,350
they're going to eat it at six o'clock
in the morning. So I'm gonna get seven,

216
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,580
eight, they're going to eat at eight
o'clock in the morning. We feed them.

217
00:12:20,581 --> 00:12:24,160
You have them, you have a meeting as soon
as they wake up. Absolutely. Yes sir. You,

218
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,370
you feed somebody till the moment they
woke up to the moment they go to bed.

219
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:31,320
What would be a typical
breakfast meal? We, we, we,

220
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:34,390
we live off the basic rule you give,
uh,

221
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,580
give people what they need when
they need it. So, you know,

222
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,730
if you're a Robic right and your body's
primary source of fuel is going to be

223
00:12:39,731 --> 00:12:41,140
more fats,
uh,

224
00:12:41,141 --> 00:12:45,610
your brain's primary source of fuel is
going to be a carbohydrate or glucose,

225
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:49,990
right? So we give them like
a lot of fruits, right?

226
00:12:49,991 --> 00:12:53,620
The glucose feed, the brain,
a lot of fats. You know, we
made sure that we, you know,

227
00:12:53,621 --> 00:12:57,400
we get a good measurement of
Omega threes, Omega Sixes, um,

228
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,300
basically a better about a two to one
ratio. So throughout today, you know,

229
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:04,450
if they're, if they're are throughout
the day, we give them, you know,

230
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:09,610
fruits, vegetables, um, Omega
six, Omega threes. And then when,

231
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:12,640
once they start working out,
then, you know, depending
on the workout, then that's,

232
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,740
we started giving like more
starches and stuff like that.

233
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:19,090
So basically just sort of
a light breakfast of fruits
and things on those lines

234
00:13:19,091 --> 00:13:22,630
to get everything moving.
And then after your first workout,

235
00:13:22,631 --> 00:13:26,620
like what's a typical postworkout meal?
I, it depends on the actual workout.

236
00:13:26,621 --> 00:13:29,330
We use something called like, you
got the metabolic equivalent, right?

237
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:33,580
So basically the met is the amount
of oxygen and your body uses.

238
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,580
And that that's going to
determine basically, uh,

239
00:13:36,581 --> 00:13:37,600
the amount of calories that your body,

240
00:13:37,601 --> 00:13:39,850
so let's say a strength
and conditioning workout,

241
00:13:39,851 --> 00:13:42,890
what if they're going to do weights and
sprints and things along those lines.

242
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:47,850
So what we'll do is everything
is actually like a formula.

243
00:13:47,851 --> 00:13:52,690
Everything is, everything is broken
down mathematically. So we'll take a,

244
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:54,810
they're met and we'll,

245
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:59,080
we'll go on a scale of one to 10 and we
multiply that by the actual amount of

246
00:13:59,081 --> 00:14:02,340
weight that that individual has,
like a kilogram. So we'll say, um,

247
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,800
their intensity is a 10.
Let's say they have a hard workout,

248
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:10,060
tends you to have Tammy. We multiply
that by the amount of kilograms, um,

249
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:14,440
that that individual has a, I
believe. And then look at the formula.

250
00:14:14,441 --> 00:14:19,441
We basically divide that by a 200 and
multiply that by the duration I actually

251
00:14:19,931 --> 00:14:20,291
work out.

252
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:22,840
And that'll give us the amount of
actual calories that that individual is

253
00:14:22,841 --> 00:14:27,010
actually using for that workout.
So every workout is going to be different.

254
00:14:27,011 --> 00:14:31,450
So if you're, if you're,
if you're doing, um, like,

255
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,581
what's the word I'm looking for?

256
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:38,170
Like training in terms of like
guard passing and stuff like that,

257
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,660
it's going to be a lot different
than if you're sparring, right?

258
00:14:40,661 --> 00:14:44,140
So a lot of people, they actually, they
feed themselves the same way. If they're,

259
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:48,640
if they're doing form versus actually
training like sporing you don't they,

260
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,540
they do the same thing I'm going to take
to, you know, in two scoops, protein,

261
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:53,840
I would take this, this
and this. You have to,

262
00:14:53,841 --> 00:14:56,870
you have to actually feed the
body differently every single,

263
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:01,850
every single workout, right? So
we'll take that formula. We find out,

264
00:15:01,851 --> 00:15:02,061
okay,

265
00:15:02,061 --> 00:15:05,000
this amount of calories
that this individual burns
during this period of time,

266
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:09,350
and then we actually break it down even
more because if you jog and you burn a

267
00:15:09,351 --> 00:15:13,490
thousand calories, right? And if you
lift and burn a thousand calories,

268
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,560
same amount of calories,

269
00:15:15,561 --> 00:15:19,310
but you have to refuel the
body differently because
if you jog by just using a

270
00:15:19,311 --> 00:15:20,420
lot more fat,
and if you're,

271
00:15:20,421 --> 00:15:23,540
if you're lifting and your body's
getting a lot more carbohydrates, again,

272
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:27,360
it goes to giving the body what it needs
when it needs it. So we'll look at it.

273
00:15:27,361 --> 00:15:31,430
I'm like, okay, well if it's a
level 10 and then we'll literally,

274
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:35,600
when we had the formulas for
word, so a 10 would be a 80, 20.

275
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:39,560
So you, you find out the amount of
calories is universal is burning and 80,

276
00:15:39,561 --> 00:15:43,790
20 meaning 80% carbohydrates,
20% proteins, right?

277
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:46,980
And as you go to carbohydrate,
mostly francophone,

278
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:50,390
so your body has some called a know,

279
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:55,160
you have receptors in the
body, right? People think that
like, well, you know, if I,

280
00:15:55,161 --> 00:15:56,540
if I,
if I need carbohydrates,

281
00:15:56,541 --> 00:16:01,020
my body is just going to ingest them
and it doesn't work like that. Um,

282
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:05,150
your body can process about one gram
of carbohydrate per minute, right?

283
00:16:05,151 --> 00:16:09,970
But if you are able to actually
access more, uh, actually, um,

284
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:15,050
use more than one, um,
transport, um, at a time,

285
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:20,030
you can actually go to about
two, three, 2.3 grams per minute.

286
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,450
And a, yeah, you have
good one, two, three,

287
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,030
four and you get as good one as glue to,

288
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:30,860
it's one of these has a different thing
that actually activate them. Right?

289
00:16:30,861 --> 00:16:35,450
And I can ask you too, is, is a solely
independent transporter, right? If you,

290
00:16:35,451 --> 00:16:37,550
if you use a sodium dependent transporter,

291
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:42,320
goof for us is a insulin dependent
transporter. A good one is a,

292
00:16:42,321 --> 00:16:46,720
I believe, um, and I'm sorry.
Good five is a frutose. Uh,

293
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:48,260
it's activated by Frutose,
right?

294
00:16:48,261 --> 00:16:51,170
So if you use more than one of
these transporters at a time,

295
00:16:51,171 --> 00:16:52,700
you activate these transporters.

296
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:58,070
There were literally you're able to
actually synthesize carbohydrates twice as

297
00:16:58,071 --> 00:17:01,550
fast. So you're doing different types of
carbohydrates and mixing them together.

298
00:17:01,551 --> 00:17:04,740
Hundred percent. Group One, uh,

299
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,280
as good one is a solo
independent transporter.

300
00:17:07,281 --> 00:17:08,510
So you gotta make it solely independent.

301
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:11,330
You got to make sure that you add sodium,
right?

302
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,150
Who for his insulin
dependent transporters,

303
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,880
what's going to help a
insulin be transported? You,

304
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:20,300
you need something that's high-glycemic.
So something that's dextrose.

305
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:24,830
But what is like a food?
That's a good one. Um,

306
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:29,920
well salt break down
salt and then a glute,

307
00:17:30,221 --> 00:17:34,880
a glute five or a glue five would
be a fruit toast, which be fruit,

308
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,990
right? So we you don't offer,
I'll a break down fruit for him.

309
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:43,220
And then dextrose is, is basically
like in Tampa, sugar as you have,

310
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,150
you know what I mean? So, uh,

311
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:51,030
as basically we incorporate sugar,
fructose and salt. You put those together.

312
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:54,120
Now the funny thing is,
is when you incorporate caffeine,

313
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:58,080
it's been shown that
caffeine postworkout you'll,

314
00:17:58,081 --> 00:18:01,920
you'll see four times the amount
of glycogen in the muscle,

315
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:06,130
a post workout. If you take
the, uh, the caffeine. Yeah.

316
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:09,840
Take it in the form of caffeine
pills or do you take coffee?

317
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:14,480
I'll incorporate it with like, uh,
the, the postworkout, you know,

318
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:19,350
like a coffee shop. Yeah.
It's, uh, anhydrous like a,

319
00:18:19,351 --> 00:18:22,950
it's a, it's a stronger type.
Sometimes I'll see like, okay, if he's,

320
00:18:22,951 --> 00:18:26,670
if he's obviously going to bed later and
it'd be more of a green tea type, uh,

321
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,720
caffeine. But yeah, I mean,
the funny thing is like,

322
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:35,990
it's shown that caffeine postworkout four
times the amount of carbohydrates are

323
00:18:36,091 --> 00:18:40,850
in the muscle. And I have
yet to find out why. I,

324
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:46,190
you know, I talked to
Andy, a Gal Galton Yep.

325
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:49,530
Yeah. Do it. I love the guy. I'm like,
yeah, you know, so I'm like, Bro,

326
00:18:49,531 --> 00:18:53,660
I want to get you in the room for like an
hour and just talk to you. Um, but, uh,

327
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:56,400
I was like, and I asked him and he's
like, honestly, I don't know either.

328
00:18:56,401 --> 00:19:00,930
And I'm like, Shit. You
know what I mean? So, uh,

329
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,910
but you know, the thing is, I don't
know why, but the one thing I do know,

330
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:09,840
yes, 100%, you know, caffeine postworkout
everybody's all about, you know, caffeine.

331
00:19:09,841 --> 00:19:14,280
Preworkout caffeine. Postworkout is, is
extremely important. And with our support,

332
00:19:14,281 --> 00:19:17,910
it's so important because you got guys
that are working at two or three times a

333
00:19:17,911 --> 00:19:21,290
day, you know, they need to be
rehydrated. They need their,

334
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:24,420
their glycogen storage is the,
they need to be up.

335
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:28,170
So did you essentially learn how to
wake up by cutting weight yourself?

336
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:34,060
I learned every, every way. Not to
wait. God by myself. Rehydrating yeah,

337
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:34,920
same way.

338
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:39,210
Uh, yeah, the, the rehydration I, I
did through you, you know, like lots,

339
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,490
lots of studying, lots
of studying. You know,

340
00:19:41,491 --> 00:19:46,350
when I look back at what
I did for rehydration, I
shaved my head. I'm like, oh,

341
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:49,710
Uli, crap. Well, it's a
relatively recent thing, right?

342
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:52,320
When you think about it with wrestling,
I mean,

343
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:55,740
wrestlers didn't do such a good job
of rehydrating and they were basically

344
00:19:55,741 --> 00:20:00,450
competing the day of the weight cut.
And you sound like it's past tense.

345
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,620
They still do.

346
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:06,180
They're trying to be a little bit better
about that with the way they allow

347
00:20:06,181 --> 00:20:11,070
people with hydration tests and
colleges. And you know, it's still,

348
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,150
it's still rough, but at least
with them, there's no head trauma.

349
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:20,580
That's it. That's the big thing about
MMA is rehydrating with head trauma.

350
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,400
How much more difficult
is your job now with a,

351
00:20:23,401 --> 00:20:25,560
you saw in place where they can't use ivs?

352
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:30,590
I love not having to ivy man. Really
swear to God. Yeah. Why? Um, you know,

353
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,370
if you look at every study out there,

354
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:36,060
like the oral rehydration is
actually better for the body.

355
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,620
Everybody's so funny nowadays, everybody's
like, oh, you don't like organic,

356
00:20:40,621 --> 00:20:42,750
you know, earth grown nutrients get
to have this, you gotta have this.

357
00:20:42,751 --> 00:20:44,820
And then when it comes to like
cutting weight, it's like,

358
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,500
now let's jam a into a freaking body on
this shove 9,000 milligrams of sodium

359
00:20:50,501 --> 00:20:55,090
chloride in their freaking
veins. And that's gotta be
good. You know, if, if, uh,

360
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:59,470
if they were fighting the same day at
100% of the, yeah, you need an Ivy,

361
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,350
but they have over 30 hours
to rehydrate the body,

362
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:06,100
the body can do that on its
own and it's going to be a lot.

363
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:10,990
He's a lot more natural in terms of
absorbing nutrients and giving it what it

364
00:21:10,991 --> 00:21:12,220
needs.
Here's the thing,

365
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,530
when a lot of these guys could I
break it down like this is the amount,

366
00:21:17,531 --> 00:21:20,710
exact amount of sodium that
your body needs. A lot of,

367
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:25,510
a lot of people they will taking
in like to uh, to uh, bags of Ivs,

368
00:21:25,511 --> 00:21:29,410
right? One bag is 9,000
milligrams of sodium chloride.

369
00:21:29,411 --> 00:21:34,411
They would take in 82 bags that 18,000
milligrams of sodium chloride and they

370
00:21:35,351 --> 00:21:40,180
wouldn't take any, any potassium.
Your bodies is, it's got to have a,

371
00:21:40,181 --> 00:21:44,200
it's a balance of everything. Yeah. Yeah.
You're like, oh, you know, like Omega six,

372
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:45,660
like you look at fats,
you're like,

373
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:48,140
there's so many studies that
the Omega six is bad. You know,

374
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:50,740
like it causes all this
inflammation and stuff like, yeah,

375
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,130
Omega six does cause inflammation.
Your but you buy it needs it, your ear,

376
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:56,260
it needs it.
Your Oregon's needed,

377
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:00,550
but it needs a good amount of Omega three
to kind of clear that out. Same thing.

378
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:04,210
Sodium needs potassium. You know
like when you look at a muscle pump,

379
00:22:04,211 --> 00:22:08,950
he like sodium goes in to a muscle,
potassium comes out.

380
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:13,090
Well how does potassium and get back
in? Well in these magnesium, magnesium.

381
00:22:13,091 --> 00:22:16,420
And if you don't have magnesium you
have to have this, this balance.

382
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:18,370
And it's funny because these guys were,
you know,

383
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,370
back in the day they would take an
ivy and then, and then when they have,

384
00:22:21,371 --> 00:22:25,690
they'd have soup and they're like, oh I
need to take more salt. They would never,

385
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:28,960
basically, you look at the amount of
potassium now these guys were like,

386
00:22:28,961 --> 00:22:32,320
Hey George, what are, what do
I take? And I'm like, okay,
eat this. He does, he takes,

387
00:22:32,321 --> 00:22:33,670
and I think it's a lot healthier for them.

388
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,940
So they're getting more
sophisticated with it. Oh,

389
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,340
Johnny Hendricks recently said that one
of the reasons why he retired is because

390
00:22:39,341 --> 00:22:42,100
of you saw that and they could, they
wouldn't let them use the ivys anymore,

391
00:22:42,101 --> 00:22:46,210
but he said it made a big difference
with him. Yeah. There's, um,

392
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:52,380
there's a lot of people that are in this
job dough that they have no business

393
00:22:52,421 --> 00:22:55,630
being in this job doing what I do.
Like, I mean, I just got our shoes,

394
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:59,470
I've talked to him. How many people
like you are there out there?

395
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:02,440
I know there's chairing.
Yeah. And there's, um,

396
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:08,170
there's a nutrition and I think
perfecting athletes, things like that.

397
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:12,880
Um, I've, I've talked to a couple
people, you know, like, oh, you don't,

398
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:16,330
at the end of the day, man, honestly, I
always tell people, I'm like, you know,

399
00:23:16,331 --> 00:23:18,940
I told my wife this. I'm like, you know,
a game is babe. And she's like, what?

400
00:23:18,941 --> 00:23:21,550
I'm like, it's your ability to present
that you could give a fuck. Right.

401
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:27,070
And I'm like, and I'm like, you don't,
real game is, it's actually given a fuck.

402
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:30,280
You know what I'm saying? Like there's
a lot of people that they are like, oh,

403
00:23:30,281 --> 00:23:32,250
I want to help you. I don't want to help
you out. You know what I'm saying? Like,

404
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,790
and people were actually like,
oh cool.

405
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:36,280
But then they realize that and that's
why they work with us cause they,

406
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:39,730
we actually give a fuck. Like we care,
you know, and you sit there and just like,

407
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:44,210
um, we talked, you know, like
were we, we were working with, um,

408
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:49,350
a Gray Jackson? Well it was, it
was, uh, it was Jonny bones and um,

409
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:53,370
it was a fight or whatever. And, and, and
I'm like, I'm like, hey guys, you know,

410
00:23:53,371 --> 00:23:57,920
like obviously we work with DC and DC.
He's got exclusivity with us. I'm like,

411
00:23:57,921 --> 00:24:01,220
how's he doing with the rehydration? Like,
oh, he's using the rehydration. I'm like,

412
00:24:01,221 --> 00:24:05,900
dude, the rehydration I gave you
guys was before the IB ban like this.

413
00:24:05,901 --> 00:24:09,230
It's not the same. And like, Oh, you
think you talked to his nutritionist?

414
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,080
So wanting to talk to him. And I
was like, you know, I was like, oh,

415
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:15,080
what's the osmolality of the,
the water that you given him?

416
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:19,490
And he looked to me like I had to
dig around my forehead and I'm like,

417
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:23,240
well how much fucking salt you
give? And I'm, he's like, Whoa,

418
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:26,060
I'm not giving them salt. I haven't
given him salt. There's dark, you know,

419
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:30,710
fucking training camp. Why
would I give himself and I,

420
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,800
I wasn't going to sit down and give him
a fucking whole lecture on nutrition but

421
00:24:33,801 --> 00:24:38,540
like how the fucking body works or
anything like that. But um, I was like,

422
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:43,310
I just, I went to Johnny bones and I said,
bro, fucking start eating fucking salt.

423
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:46,460
Like your life depends on her brother
because I mean basically the muscle

424
00:24:46,461 --> 00:24:48,200
contraction that you have,

425
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,110
a lot of it depends on the amount of
sodium that your body has. You know,

426
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:54,350
the amount of glycogen absorption,

427
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,930
muscle contraction neurons in the body,

428
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:01,180
it's all dependent on fucking salt. And
when you got guys that are like, wow,

429
00:25:01,181 --> 00:25:05,390
you know, if I can no salt, I
think a lot of guys were in this,

430
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:09,650
in this game because they want their
name on the fucking highlights and shit

431
00:25:09,651 --> 00:25:10,970
like that.
And you'll see me.

432
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:15,690
Well, it's real bizarre that this
is such a gigantic sport. Yeah.

433
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:17,400
I mean it's an enormous sport.

434
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:22,650
But in terms of even the way people train,
it's,

435
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:26,130
I mean, no one really, there's
not a consensus on what's the,

436
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:29,370
what's the correct way to do it.
And then when it comes to nutrition,

437
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,780
there's not a consensus.
Right.

438
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:34,770
And then there's the rehydration and
dehydration factor that doesn't exist in

439
00:25:34,771 --> 00:25:37,870
any other sport other than than boxing.
Right. I mean this is the, Oh and,

440
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:41,430
and I think it's more extreme in MMA than
it is even in boxing for the most part.

441
00:25:41,431 --> 00:25:42,390
Right.
It's just,

442
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:47,340
it's such a crazy thing that you've got
these super high level athletes that are

443
00:25:47,341 --> 00:25:50,610
dealing with Jim Burrows.
I mean there's a lot of bro,

444
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:54,210
like real high level athletes and I've
talked to their trainers and I'm like,

445
00:25:54,211 --> 00:25:57,810
what did you just say? Like you're a
gym, Bro. How'd you get with this guy?

446
00:25:57,811 --> 00:26:02,280
This guy's a fucking world class fighter
and he's got some Schmo from fucking

447
00:26:02,281 --> 00:26:04,950
Gold's gym. No offense, Gold's
gym. But you know what I mean?

448
00:26:04,951 --> 00:26:07,610
Some fuckers guys got a tub of
shit with them. And he's like,

449
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:11,930
got to take three days and $4
because I read about it in Weeder.

450
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:12,750
You know what I mean?

451
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:17,750
They don't really have a strict protocol
and it's not really based on science

452
00:26:19,441 --> 00:26:22,200
and blood work and,
and real science.

453
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:24,620
No,
100% like it's,

454
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:29,380
it's sad because the sport is at the
end of the day. Like they'll be like,

455
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:33,100
well that guy's jacked you the strength
and conditioning coach. He'd be like,

456
00:26:33,101 --> 00:26:35,940
he's fucking biggest fuck you. Look. Yeah,
you shouldn't get it. You know, like,

457
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:39,040
and like, oh, you know, a couple
of people. You're now my agent.

458
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:42,670
You know what I mean? Like it's,
it's, you know, like in terms of NFL,

459
00:26:42,671 --> 00:26:44,010
like we with him,
you know,

460
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,900
we work with a lot of different
people that we, you know,

461
00:26:45,901 --> 00:26:50,220
we Demi Lavato and shit like that. Like
he's this close to your first, sorry,

462
00:26:50,221 --> 00:26:53,370
sorry. Everybody does it.
So I'd rather than sorry.

463
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,920
And I know my voice is
there. People are like, good,

464
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:57,240
you got to have subtitles on this.

465
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:04,440
It's not the year. Is
this the model? Remember

466
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:08,690
Anderson Silva got popped and then
people started circulating photos of

467
00:27:08,691 --> 00:27:13,610
Anderson's trainer. He's seven years
old. Built like a brick shit house.

468
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:17,070
I mean it's got veins coming
out of his fucking muscles.

469
00:27:17,071 --> 00:27:20,630
They're just like garden hoses. Have
you ever seen him? No. It's hilarious.

470
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:23,090
When we found out that Anderson
got popped for steroids,

471
00:27:23,091 --> 00:27:26,720
then they saw a picture of his train. I'm
like, wow, I wonder where he got them.

472
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:32,030
He see if you find you got a photo of
the guy is a picture of him taking a

473
00:27:32,031 --> 00:27:35,660
Selfie at the gym? No,
no. That's not the guy.

474
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,870
This strength and conditioning guy.
He's fucking Jack.

475
00:27:38,871 --> 00:27:43,871
He's a a darker gentlemen and he's
built like a brick shit house.

476
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:48,920
He looks more like a bodybuilder and he
does a strength and conditioning coach.

477
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,570
You got it? Yeah. Here it is.

478
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:56,990
I'm the guy with the white shirt on. Yeah,
that's him. But that's not the photo.

479
00:27:56,991 --> 00:27:59,440
I want dairy his

480
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:05,480
day and he's, he's in his sixties
wow. Yeah, so you see that? Oh well

481
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:10,580
that's what I was without my
shirt. I believe you will.

482
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:11,640
Something going on there,

483
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:17,180
few south of the border
supplements. Uh, but you know,

484
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:21,590
but the point is that even like the
best of the best world class fighters,

485
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:27,010
they don't necessarily have a background
in nutrition or kinesiology or exercise

486
00:28:29,451 --> 00:28:30,350
physiology.

487
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:34,550
Don't necessarily know exactly the way
to the right way to approach things.

488
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:38,930
I mean, shit, for years, fighters wouldn't
even drink water in between rounds.

489
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:40,400
Right. You know, I mean,

490
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:45,350
they thought water made you cramp and
there's a lot of like crazy shit involved

491
00:28:45,351 --> 00:28:47,780
in this sports still to this day.

492
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:50,240
You don't know what you
don't know. And, and uh,

493
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:53,840
I tell you our goals by
the end of next year,

494
00:28:53,841 --> 00:28:55,790
we're going to work with every
single fighter in the UFC.

495
00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:59,030
We have over 200 fighters in the
UFC right now. Every single one.

496
00:28:59,031 --> 00:29:01,700
So you're going to push everybody
else out. Fuck off and fuck everybody.

497
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:06,200
Fuck everybody. 100% man. You know, what
are they doing wrong? Everything was,

498
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,660
what are the other guys doing wrong?
Everything.

499
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:10,470
They don't know what the
fuck they're doing job well,

500
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,060
that 100% they have no fucking clue. What
the fuck did all of them? All of them.

501
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,700
100%. I have people fucking
drinking. They're like, oh,

502
00:29:16,701 --> 00:29:19,670
their drink is see like the drink and uh,
um,

503
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:23,930
was it a salt water during the fucking,
then the week of the fight and uh,

504
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:26,720
you know, I hear if gas from
att like, Hey George, why,

505
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:30,380
why the fuck would they do that?
Because that's fucking, that's Asinine.

506
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:32,360
Have I have people fucking be like,
oh,

507
00:29:32,361 --> 00:29:35,150
we don't want to cut carbs
out because we want, you know,

508
00:29:35,151 --> 00:29:38,570
like it takes a specific amount of time
to rehydrate carbs. They, you know,

509
00:29:38,571 --> 00:29:40,310
they're thinking it takes
like four fucking days,

510
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,550
but when you actually do it properly,
like this is, this is all scientific shit,

511
00:29:45,551 --> 00:29:48,070
like literally takes
24 hours to rehydrate.

512
00:29:48,071 --> 00:29:51,280
Somebody is fucking glycogen storage
if you fucking take their water right?

513
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:54,340
So every gram of glycogen hold on
to three grams of water, right?

514
00:29:54,341 --> 00:29:57,730
And we can literally find out based
on the amount of muscle tissue that

515
00:29:57,731 --> 00:29:58,690
individual holds,

516
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:04,080
exactly how much glycogen your body holds
and how much water that is attached.

517
00:30:04,301 --> 00:30:09,080
That glycogen do you work with
Y'all Ramiro? We did. Yes. That too.

518
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,840
I look at that guy and I go,

519
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:15,620
how the fuck is a 185 pound man?
You want it?

520
00:30:15,621 --> 00:30:18,820
You want to hear you wanna hear
some stats with us, man. So people,

521
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:22,750
people were like, ah, you'll
like, I don't have 100% you know,

522
00:30:22,751 --> 00:30:26,770
like great Joe and I take time
making wait. I'll tell you,

523
00:30:26,771 --> 00:30:27,970
I take pride in that shit.
You know why?

524
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,430
Because I've taken motherfuckers that I
know they're not going to make weight.

525
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:35,290
I know that. You know what I'm
saying? But Dude, I'm like,

526
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:38,950
hey man, my, you know, I want to either
a be there. It'd be like bitches,

527
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:41,830
he's not gonna make it. And
I cut that shit. I could.

528
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:45,070
I've got coaches that are like,
he's being a pussy. I'm like, dude,

529
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:45,690
he's going to die.

530
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:50,010
He literally is fucking cut point to
God damn pounds in the last 30 minutes.

531
00:30:50,011 --> 00:30:54,340
He's got 10 pounds ago. He ain't gonna
make it. He's kidneys are going to be, oh,

532
00:30:54,341 --> 00:30:57,430
he's being a pussy. Fuck you. No,
fuck you guys, man. I cut it off.

533
00:30:57,431 --> 00:30:59,950
You know what I'm saying with you?
Well,

534
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:06,160
just between us, right?
No one's listening.

535
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:08,770
So I'm in Australia.

536
00:31:08,771 --> 00:31:13,570
He showed up at one 98 and he missed
by two and a half pounds right with us.

537
00:31:13,571 --> 00:31:18,571
He showed up 217 pounds and was 5.2 and
the only reason that he fucking miss by

538
00:31:19,121 --> 00:31:21,130
that point too,
just cause it fucking athletic commission.

539
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:24,970
The commission in New York, brush them
off. They fucking came in there like,

540
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:28,150
I was like, Hey, I'm broke. I'm
like, cool down. Take your time.

541
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,080
I'll give him 45 minutes to like fucking
just chill. We put them in the bath.

542
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:34,740
Then the commission came in there and
we're like, yeah, how are you feeling?

543
00:31:34,741 --> 00:31:36,580
He's like, I feel good to
go. And they were like,

544
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:40,840
you know the guy you literally
said, he said, you know,

545
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:44,170
unfortunately that's what all heroes say.
But unfortunately all heroes are dead.

546
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:45,370
And I'm like,
first off,

547
00:31:45,371 --> 00:31:47,110
that's the dumbest thing I've
ever fucking heard in my life.

548
00:31:47,111 --> 00:31:49,690
Like there's a lot of fucking heroes
that are still fucking God down the line.

549
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:54,820
You know what I'm saying? He wants
a quote and I'm sitting there like,

550
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:59,530
what the fuck are you talking about? You
know what I'm saying? But they were like,

551
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:02,050
he's, you know, he needs to be
downstairs. And I were like,

552
00:32:02,051 --> 00:32:05,380
well he has a whole hour and they were
like, no, no, he needs to be downstairs.

553
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:09,700
Even when he got down there, he was
still sweating on the fucking scale Joe.

554
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:14,050
And it was fucking too,
but here's my thing.

555
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:19,150
He showed up to 17 and we got
him point to over 85 that Mama,

556
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:23,350
I weigh one 97 and I stand
next to him and I'm like,

557
00:32:23,351 --> 00:32:28,351
how in the fuck is that 185 pound man.

558
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:33,010
He is a straight up silverback.
That dude is so jack,

559
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:35,530
you want to talk about genetics?

560
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:39,500
I mean what kind of fucking
genetics is that dude have

561
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:42,860
first night we fucking were doing the
co with them. He had never done it.

562
00:32:42,861 --> 00:32:43,694
He never did a bath.

563
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:48,170
I know he never did a bath because he
went in backwards like literally like

564
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:52,820
we're like yo head goes over here bro.
Like you'd never been in a bat.

565
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,111
He got out,

566
00:32:54,111 --> 00:32:58,430
he fucking lost a lot more weight than
he expected and he fucking butt ass naked

567
00:32:58,431 --> 00:33:02,810
man. Fuck. Comes into us. Ah,
the fuck. I'm like, oh yo bro.

568
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:07,430
Fucking not hugging me, like shaking me
and shit. I'm losing my man card tonight.

569
00:33:07,431 --> 00:33:11,360
But you know what? I fucking, I'm
not going to fucking, you know,

570
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:13,090
he's a big fucking dude.
So

571
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:18,180
if you know what I'm
saying? Yeah. He's uh,

572
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:21,720
he's like the freakiest of all
the freak athletes, you know,

573
00:33:21,721 --> 00:33:24,430
of all the dudes where you just
like, you look at them, you go,

574
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:29,320
what are the odds that someone turns
out like that? You know of all the,

575
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:33,250
all the guys who like, like a regular
book and guys like an Evan Dunham,

576
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:36,600
regular looking guy and
then you got to Yo Romero,

577
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:41,050
it's like the world's not fair.
That's not fucking fair math.

578
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:46,390
It's not fair. And that's him on
weight, right? I mean, what the fuck?

579
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:51,940
What Day it is a redemption.
Okay. Yeah. So that is him.

580
00:33:51,941 --> 00:33:55,180
Back in the day when you had a cut
actual weight for the weigh ins.

581
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:57,340
That's before the,

582
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:02,620
like if you look at 'em with the new
ones where he gets to rehydrate such a

583
00:34:02,651 --> 00:34:04,780
freak man. Fuck. And when he talks,

584
00:34:04,781 --> 00:34:08,230
tosses getting the fact that he's in
his forties, like what in the fuck?

585
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:11,650
And they test that shit out of
that dude that they don't even,

586
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:16,150
that doesn't even make sense.
Like one plus one is 18 test them again.

587
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:21,400
It doesn't make any sense.
How come you don't work with him anymore?

588
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:26,000
I do. Oh, you're still doing what?
I'm so yeah, just uh, we had uh,

589
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,330
we were working with,
uh,

590
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:31,350
Robert Whitaker and they decided
to not use us the last week.

591
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:36,180
Um, we're like, all right, so we
call it gives you the last week, Bro.

592
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,750
There's a lot of shit.
You know how this game goes.

593
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,890
I do know how this game goes.
This is,

594
00:34:41,891 --> 00:34:45,540
this is one of the more disappointing
aspects of this game is that I feel like

595
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:50,340
I'm fighting in particular
is so it's so dangerous.

596
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:51,930
It's so personal.

597
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:57,290
It's so there's so much involved that I
feel like loyalty should be at a premium

598
00:34:59,191 --> 00:35:03,150
and it should be one of the most
emphasized things like your team,

599
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:08,040
as long as you have a good team,
like your team is critical.

600
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:09,120
I mean it's,
it's,

601
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:13,380
it's everything for the emotional
stability of the fighter,

602
00:35:13,381 --> 00:35:17,070
but also for not feeling like you're
a piece of shit. Right. You know,

603
00:35:17,071 --> 00:35:21,330
and I think there's something to that
these guys had just dumped their trainers

604
00:35:21,331 --> 00:35:21,661
and,

605
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:26,040
and dumped their coaches and then hop
from camp to camp and don't get a better

606
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:30,270
result from it. I think there's part
of them that realizes like, hey man,

607
00:35:30,271 --> 00:35:35,271
this guy brought you to the dance and you
abandoned them somewhere along the way

608
00:35:36,031 --> 00:35:38,280
because you know,
you a greener grass

609
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:41,040
on the other side of the fence and
it didn't turn out to be greener.

610
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,920
And if you don't feel like a champion,
you know,

611
00:35:43,921 --> 00:35:46,290
you'll feel like kind of
a weasel. Right, right.

612
00:35:46,291 --> 00:35:49,980
And there's a lot of guys like that,
but then there's guys who are,

613
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:52,590
they're in a situation like Tj Dillashaw,
right.

614
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:57,030
Where he was in a situation where he
was like, this, this doesn't seem right.

615
00:35:57,031 --> 00:35:59,520
Like I don't like the
way this camp has going.

616
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,530
And then Duane Ludwig
comes along and he's like,

617
00:36:01,531 --> 00:36:04,920
I am fucking learning and growing
with this guy. And he's like, look,

618
00:36:04,921 --> 00:36:07,110
I gotta go guys, I'll still
train with you. I love you,

619
00:36:07,111 --> 00:36:10,280
but I got to think about my future.
And then they'll like you fucking weasel.

620
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:14,430
You left us. But look, he's
right. You look at the results.

621
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:18,990
Clearly he was right. I mean, Tj right
now, uh, he's, he defended his title,

622
00:36:18,991 --> 00:36:22,380
beat Cody twice, one of the best in
the world. You look at his improvement,

623
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,670
his overall growth is improvement
inside the octagon. Like he was right.

624
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:30,360
You know, and so it's a,
it's a, it's a weird balance.

625
00:36:30,361 --> 00:36:34,080
Like when do you pull the chute? When
do you bail? When you get out of there?

626
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:39,390
You know, when, when, uh,
you know, the first person I
ever worked with Brian, Stan,

627
00:36:39,391 --> 00:36:41,390
you know, me and him were in the
Marine Corps together. You know,

628
00:36:41,391 --> 00:36:44,340
like there's still only
reason I'm actually doing
what I'm doing today because

629
00:36:44,341 --> 00:36:49,320
of Brian. Yeah. Oh Wow. I love that
guy, dude. He's that shit in, you know,

630
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:54,300
I love him to death, man. He's
a, he's just all around him.

631
00:36:54,301 --> 00:36:58,080
I want him to run for president, Bro. I
don't understand. Motherfuckers are like,

632
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:02,130
you know, I was just analogy. I'm like,
aw, you don't let, people were like, oh,

633
00:37:02,131 --> 00:37:05,100
this guy's a good guy. He's never
cheated on his wife. He never done this,

634
00:37:05,101 --> 00:37:06,740
done that. And I'm like, Dude,
look at the motherfucker.

635
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:11,370
He doesn't have options saying like,
look at him Brian,

636
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:15,570
that motherfucker's got
options. He's like, I'm like,

637
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:19,410
you are so God damn good. Like you
would get a text from a, like a female,

638
00:37:19,411 --> 00:37:22,940
and they'd be like, Hey, I
just did a photo shoot, blah,
blah, blah. And I'm like, no,

639
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:26,370
my wife would not appreciate you. Uh, you
don't text me in this form of fashion.

640
00:37:26,371 --> 00:37:29,280
And I'm like, I hate
hanging out with you, bro.

641
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:33,390
You made me feel like a horrible person.
That's another thing. This is always on.

642
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:36,030
You know what I mean? He's just a good
month. If he's a great guy, he's a great,

643
00:37:36,031 --> 00:37:39,360
great fucking guy. You know what I mean?
But uh, you know, at the end of the day,

644
00:37:39,361 --> 00:37:43,110
man, you know, he uh,
we, we, I'm like, you're,

645
00:37:43,111 --> 00:37:47,340
you're built like a god down t rex,
you know, big head fucking short arms.

646
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:51,300
You know what I'm saying? And you know,
at WC you fucking won the world title.

647
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:54,940
Got To, you know, UFC, it wasn't
working out for him. I'm like,

648
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,700
you need to go to one eight five is like,
you know,

649
00:37:56,701 --> 00:37:58,570
you helped me out to cut
the fuck. Yeah, dude, man,

650
00:37:58,590 --> 00:37:59,670
that's what I was doing
in the Marine Corps.

651
00:37:59,671 --> 00:38:03,420
I was helping guys get down to a weight
and then they had to actually perform.

652
00:38:03,421 --> 00:38:04,680
That's what my job in the Marine Corps.

653
00:38:04,681 --> 00:38:07,740
So your job with the Marine Corps was
helping guys get down weight so that the

654
00:38:07,741 --> 00:38:11,550
performance would be better
in combat, right. You, you
have to actually, you have,

655
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:14,640
you have weight standards and we have
performance standards in the Marine Corps.

656
00:38:14,641 --> 00:38:18,210
So how would you dial
that in based on body fat?

657
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,090
Based on just how much mass
there k the carrying around.

658
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,370
I think there's a lot to it, but
you know, it depends on, you know,

659
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:26,550
yeah I absolutely like okay this,
this, the build this individual,

660
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,890
this is where activity level,
this is what time they wake up,

661
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,110
but then they go to sleep.
This is what their mos,

662
00:38:31,111 --> 00:38:34,350
which for us that's military
operational skill. Like you know,

663
00:38:34,351 --> 00:38:36,850
if you have something that's a recon
marine and they're going to have a lot

664
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:41,550
different caloric needs and
somebody that's a fucking
mad man, you don't, right,

665
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:45,120
right. So, you know, we give the body
what it needs when it needs it. You know.

666
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:49,270
And it's funny cause we never
have a, a base diet. You know,

667
00:38:49,271 --> 00:38:52,190
like if somebody is basically um,

668
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:57,220
they don't have an anaerobic workout
throughout the day, you know,

669
00:38:57,221 --> 00:39:00,520
like a ketogenic diet is perfect for them.
You know what I'm saying?

670
00:39:00,521 --> 00:39:02,980
Like they don't need those carbs.
They don't, they don't like it.

671
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:06,370
Like you actually need a ketogenic diet
because you give the body what it needs

672
00:39:06,371 --> 00:39:09,430
when it needs it. When
your aerobic, you're by his
primary source of fuel is fat,

673
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:13,030
your body's primary source few ways is
going to be that fat. So what do we do?

674
00:39:13,031 --> 00:39:15,130
We feed it the fucking fat,
you know what I mean?

675
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:19,820
If you are anaerobic and
your your training throughout
the day, then we, you know,

676
00:39:19,821 --> 00:39:22,090
we actually incorporated
a lot more carbohydrates.

677
00:39:22,091 --> 00:39:26,400
I'm just giving someone who's
lifting weights, doing shit.

678
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:30,730
What I'm saying, you know, people
nutrition a lot like religion.

679
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:35,150
If you fucking don't agree with somebody
like lot my friends are like, oh dude,

680
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,660
this guy, I don't know what the fuck
he's talking about. I've noticed that.

681
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:42,560
It's very bizarre when I've
had some conversations on
the podcast recently about

682
00:39:42,561 --> 00:39:43,890
that, uh, more,

683
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:47,840
more ways than one was the most civil
one was between Lane Bryant and Dominic

684
00:39:47,841 --> 00:39:52,400
D'Agostino where they were
tall lean Norton rather
where they were talking about

685
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:55,900
a ketogenic diets versus um,
uh,

686
00:39:55,940 --> 00:40:00,140
carbohydrate diets and a
bio lane. Uh, you know,

687
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:01,580
do you know Layne Layne Norton?

688
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:05,430
Yeah. Well, I, I did see
that super, super smart guy.

689
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:08,000
George is going on that podcast. You'd
better fucking watch this. I'm like, wow,

690
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,060
okay. Yeah, Super Smart Guy.

691
00:40:10,061 --> 00:40:13,270
Very but more emphasizes carbohydrates.

692
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:17,600
Whereas Dom D'agostino was, uh, they're
both scientists, like legit scientists.

693
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:21,190
He emphasizes Ketogenic Diet and it's,
it's very,

694
00:40:21,191 --> 00:40:25,420
it's very interesting conversation because
lane really never was on a ketogenic

695
00:40:25,421 --> 00:40:26,710
diet for a long period of time.

696
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:31,890
Whereas Dom emphasizes that when you
get a fat adapted over longer periods of

697
00:40:32,351 --> 00:40:35,230
time, four to six months,
it, you, your body,

698
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:40,120
there's some legitimate benefits with
cognitive function and even performance

699
00:40:40,121 --> 00:40:44,230
benefits as, as time goes
on, but certainly is in
terms of your energy level,

700
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:46,080
your ability to perform was that okay?
Oh,

701
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:51,150
systemic. No matter what
says 10 my Callso Day, like,

702
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:54,360
you know, like, guess I'm like Connor, you
know, if I put them on a ketogenic diet,

703
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:59,010
he'd be fucked. You know what I mean? He's
powering output quick, fast in a hurry.

704
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:03,510
You know,
your muscles use that glycogen from that,

705
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:07,020
that part of the muscle, whatever
they're using right there and then,

706
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:10,980
whereas because he's explosive
100%. Yeah. You know, and that's,

707
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:15,360
and that's where I think people have a
problem. Like, you know, like I'm not a,

708
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:17,690
you know, I will say Voltaire,
you know, he says you,

709
00:41:17,691 --> 00:41:21,930
you knew the true knowledge of individual,
not by the, by the uh, answers that you,

710
00:41:21,931 --> 00:41:23,610
but, but by the questions
they ask, you know,

711
00:41:23,611 --> 00:41:26,310
like a lot of people were like
a la carte, you know, like, uh,

712
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:29,700
there's peanut butter. Good for me. I'm
like, well it depends. I can talk to you.

713
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:34,860
[inaudible] going to say though,
when this road is too long,

714
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:38,180
is it the time to travel motherfuckers is,
when is it good for you?

715
00:41:38,181 --> 00:41:42,290
That's the wrong question is when is
it good for you? What are you doing?

716
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:44,910
What is your activity level
kind of peanut butter, right?

717
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:48,140
Shit that's piled up with sugar
or real pain on the fuckers.

718
00:41:48,141 --> 00:41:52,070
Did I tell you that people like, it's like
people are like, well, you need healthy.

719
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,540
I'm like,
what the fuck is healthy?

720
00:41:53,541 --> 00:41:56,570
You're putting oil in your gas tank
and putting gas in the oil pan.

721
00:41:56,810 --> 00:42:00,410
You know what I'm saying? Everything that
you do in a restaurant quotion you beg,

722
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,670
you break down your body,

723
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:05,780
your body's using fuel on a different
ratio based on the iTivity that you have.

724
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:10,310
And it's like, well, if you're
giving your body carbohydrates,

725
00:42:10,311 --> 00:42:13,190
but your body's using fats,
why the fuck is that healthy?

726
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:17,840
You know what I'm saying?
It's not, it's not. It's so,
it's so simple. But you know,

727
00:42:17,841 --> 00:42:21,920
we, we started, people follow this program
grow and, and they're like, Holy Shit,

728
00:42:21,921 --> 00:42:23,510
I feel I'm never hungry.

729
00:42:23,511 --> 00:42:26,030
You have energy and this because
you're giving the body what it needs

730
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:31,250
all the time. All the time,
Bro. Do you limit any foods?
Are there any, like, do you,

731
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:35,330
do you allow people to eat pasta or bread?
Do you cut anything out of the Diet?

732
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:40,470
I mean, honestly, they can have whatever
they want at the right fucking time.

733
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:44,300
You know? Like if you look at like
the metabolic equivalent, right?

734
00:42:44,370 --> 00:42:46,710
For somebody like yourself and say,
you go on the fucking bus,

735
00:42:46,711 --> 00:42:49,230
the fucker workout out,
you can burn 800 calories.

736
00:42:49,231 --> 00:42:51,930
You know you can burn 800 calories
in a workout, no problem, right?

737
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:55,330
So if you're burned 800 calories in your
anaerobic and your body's primary says

738
00:42:55,331 --> 00:42:56,760
a few,
it was going to be carbohydrates.

739
00:42:57,450 --> 00:43:01,350
Let's just take all the formulas and
all the math out of it for a sec,

740
00:43:01,351 --> 00:43:02,490
but let's say 800 calories.

741
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:07,560
There's four calories for every one
gram of carbohydrates for you to fucking

742
00:43:07,561 --> 00:43:10,700
replenish what you need.
You need 200 grams of carbohydrates.

743
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:13,080
Just replenish what you
just did for a workout.

744
00:43:13,110 --> 00:43:16,710
How many mother fuckers do you know
take 200 grams of carbohydrates?

745
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:21,630
Postworkout none. None. None. Very
few, but, but at the end of the week,

746
00:43:21,631 --> 00:43:25,270
they're like, I don't know why
I'm so tired. You know, like

747
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:27,080
so what kind of carbohydrates?

748
00:43:27,081 --> 00:43:31,280
We do like say if someone wanted to do
like something like a crossfit workout or

749
00:43:31,281 --> 00:43:35,850
something like that. Kettlebells, Chin
ups, box jumps, Shit like that, right?

750
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:40,300
What kind of carbohydrates to do you
have them refuel with postworkout fruit.

751
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,350
Dextrose,
caffeine and salt,

752
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:46,870
all those hundred percent because that's
going to activate all the grains of

753
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:50,520
salt as a carbohydrate. No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no. You just add it too,

754
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:54,530
because in terms of transporters,
that is one that is,

755
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:58,640
it activates the escalate one is
a sodium dependent transporter.

756
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:00,500
Now how much salt,

757
00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:03,530
how much salt would you add and what
kind of depends on how much weight they

758
00:44:03,531 --> 00:44:07,610
lose. So say if I did a hard
workout a lot, I lose seven pounds.

759
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:12,660
Fuck man. So what if I kick, you know,
like beat the shit out of the bag. Tea,

760
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:14,030
fucking run around the block,

761
00:44:14,031 --> 00:44:17,250
do hill sprints and come back
five pounds lighter or whatever.

762
00:44:17,251 --> 00:44:18,470
You just give me a number.
Okay.

763
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:21,330
Basically with sweat and now this is,
I'm,

764
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:24,730
I'm negating a lot of fucking
other math. Okay. What?

765
00:44:24,731 --> 00:44:26,950
Every pound is basically
500 milligrams of sodium.

766
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:30,370
Every pound that you lose for assault,
you lose about 500 milligrams sodium,

767
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,220
she lost pounds.

768
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:36,750
You would need basically 3,500 milligrams
of sodium to fuck or replenish with.

769
00:44:36,751 --> 00:44:39,120
Fuck you dude. That
seems like a lot. Yeah.

770
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:41,760
Not Listen to get in a lot of other
fucking things I'm telling you.

771
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:46,320
But a lot of things like people are like,
that's a lot.

772
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:49,620
There's a lot of science. Did you
look at this from fucking average Joe?

773
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:53,850
How many average Joe's gonna lose seven
God damn parent of fucking work. Zero.

774
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:57,360
Right? Then they're like,
I lost half a pound.

775
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:04,140
250 250 milligrams and fucking sodium.
You're good to go. You know what I mean?

776
00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:08,730
So how do you have them take the sodium
and what form it's all going to be like.

777
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:13,290
I actually want them to take a
carbohydrates during and post workout.

778
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,430
Yeah. Fruit. Uh, fruit. Yeah.

779
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:21,450
So it's going to be blended fruit and
in in the dextrose is going to be a

780
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,670
specific type of sugar.
They drink it.

781
00:45:23,671 --> 00:45:28,200
And what happens is when you increase
insulin, that actually decreases cortisol,

782
00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:31,170
right? Cortisol's not a
fucking bad thing, man.

783
00:45:31,171 --> 00:45:33,930
It's a Google corticoid that actually
helps get rid of inflammation.

784
00:45:33,931 --> 00:45:37,880
Problem is like, people nowadays are
like, ah, it's the fucking stress hormone.

785
00:45:37,881 --> 00:45:40,980
And she'll like, your body doesn't create
a fucking hormone. That's bad for you.

786
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:45,030
It's not going to like, your bike does
not create something that is bad for you.

787
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:48,460
It's just bad for you at the wrong
times and in the wrong doses.

788
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:52,980
Excessive against instance is instantly
bat for you. Fuck me. Ask a diabetic.

789
00:45:52,981 --> 00:45:55,200
They're like, fuck, I wish I had
that shit. You know what I'm saying?

790
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:59,280
But you have it in excessive amounts.
You know what I'm saying? That's,

791
00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:01,160
that's our problem man. I mean, we just,

792
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,940
we don't know when they're
taking how much to take.

793
00:46:02,941 --> 00:46:07,330
So do you have guys take those glucose
gels like those like runners take or no,

794
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:11,730
no, no, no. I actually, you know, like,
you know, I find out what guys like to,

795
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:12,900
you know, at the end of the day, like

796
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:17,430
consistency on a diet is the
most important fucking thing.

797
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:21,000
If I get somebody on the zone diet, the
Paleo Diet, the fucking grave who died,

798
00:46:21,001 --> 00:46:24,120
there was 75,000 dots and the fuck home,
you know, on the Internet right now,

799
00:46:24,121 --> 00:46:26,520
today, if I fucking have
you consistent on one day,

800
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:29,820
you're going to fucking certain results.
Consistency. And I always tell people,

801
00:46:29,821 --> 00:46:30,420
I'm like,

802
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:34,200
I'd rather you be a hundred a hundred
percent consistent on 10% of my diet,

803
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:39,150
then 100% consistent on 10% of the
dot. You know what I'm saying? Like,

804
00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:42,120
um,
so at the end of the day,

805
00:46:42,121 --> 00:46:46,610
like I have guys that are laid the
half sugar teeth, like, fuck me alum,

806
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:50,430
Goddamn, eat some fucking
Twizzlers postworkout your
bike's gonna fucking use it.

807
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:53,600
Your body is going to use it. You know
what I'm saying? I've heard that before.

808
00:46:53,601 --> 00:46:58,110
Or people that recommend can be a
hundred post workout. Is it the best? No.

809
00:46:58,111 --> 00:46:59,180
You know, like, you know,

810
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:02,820
I know you have Rhonda Patrick Talk
about ATP trapping and Shit like that.

811
00:47:02,821 --> 00:47:05,070
But you know, like when you're, when
you're done working out, you know,

812
00:47:05,071 --> 00:47:07,770
your body needs those carbohydrates quick,
fast in a hurry.

813
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:09,150
It's going to activate those,

814
00:47:09,151 --> 00:47:13,650
those transporters and your body's
going to use them. Is it the best?

815
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:16,490
100%. No, but it's, it's, um,

816
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:19,980
keeping your sanity and it's consistency.

817
00:47:19,981 --> 00:47:23,040
If somebody works their
ass off and they're like, I
knew if I worked my ass off,

818
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:26,820
I get some fucking Twizzlers.
Yeah, you're gonna,

819
00:47:26,821 --> 00:47:30,700
you're gonna see a lot better results.
So what, what would you recommend though?

820
00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:34,390
So if someone isn't, doesn't have a
sweet tooth, but you just, they say, hey,

821
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:39,420
what should I use to replenish my glycogen
Lockhart and least submit line and

822
00:47:39,551 --> 00:47:43,100
would be that? No, no. Honestly like a,

823
00:47:43,450 --> 00:47:47,790
like a fruit toast fruit
though. She's from fruits,
right? Breakdown fruits, right.

824
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:51,790
Uh, as sugars like a
dextrose is, is, is, it's a,

825
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,420
it's a basic sugar, you know, like,
yeah, it's a monosaccharide. Um,

826
00:47:56,590 --> 00:48:00,510
so you can find that in just about any
kind of fucking sugar. Like cane sugar.

827
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:01,900
What are you thinking about?
Like chocolate milk.

828
00:48:01,901 --> 00:48:03,880
I know a lot of guys were
doing that and stupidest thing,

829
00:48:04,350 --> 00:48:05,860
that was a big thing for
a while, right? Dude,

830
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:10,350
this is thing about studies and she liked
it. I mean, I like, it was like this is,

831
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:13,890
this is the best thing for fucking
post workout. Right? Same. Fuck.

832
00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:18,610
That was from the NSCA NCA come out with
another fucking study was like, well,

833
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:22,960
you know, like 89% of the fucking and
Latino population is lactose intolerance.

834
00:48:22,990 --> 00:48:27,610
93% of the African American population
is lactose intolerant and fucking,

835
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:30,720
I was like 90% of the fucking, um, uh,

836
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:33,280
Asian American populations
like those and died. I'm like,

837
00:48:34,090 --> 00:48:36,730
you guys literally just did a goddamn
study and you show them that most of the

838
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:38,470
goddamn population is lactose intolerant,

839
00:48:38,471 --> 00:48:41,300
but you're saying that the milk is the
best God damn thing in the fucking game

840
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:45,050
as it's stupid. It's Asinine,
you know, like, and protein like,

841
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:50,710
again, easy if, if somebody is
like, if you take, you know,

842
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:53,860
chocolate milk post work I,
but like, Joe, what do you,

843
00:48:53,861 --> 00:48:55,500
what are you using when you work out?
What do you,

844
00:48:55,501 --> 00:48:59,110
what is your body using when you work
out? Is it using cars? It using protein.

845
00:48:59,290 --> 00:49:01,480
If your body's using
protein as a source of fuel,

846
00:49:01,570 --> 00:49:05,290
you're fucking doing something fucked
up, man. You know what I'm saying? Like,

847
00:49:05,291 --> 00:49:08,800
literally your body go through, you know,
Gluco neogenesis, you know, like fucking,

848
00:49:08,890 --> 00:49:11,350
it'll, it'll, it'll turn protein
and a fucking carbohydrates,

849
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:13,660
but that ain't the way it's
supposed to fucking be.

850
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:18,880
So you would never recommend someone
doing like that Carnivore Diet? No,

851
00:49:18,890 --> 00:49:23,350
no, no. See I'm never, I'm a never, never
guy. Like I'm never going to say never.

852
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:27,280
You know what I'm saying? Because
depending on your lifestyle, you know,

853
00:49:27,281 --> 00:49:31,150
if you were sedentary and, and uh,
you know, you don't do anything,

854
00:49:31,151 --> 00:49:33,970
that's anaerobic. I'm going
to, um, I would promote the,

855
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:36,970
the ketogenic diet for somebody.
Yeah. It's not even a ketogenic diet.

856
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:38,740
That's the thing about the carnivore diet.

857
00:49:39,970 --> 00:49:43,360
Patrick went over pretty much in detail
and she thinks what's going on for the

858
00:49:43,361 --> 00:49:46,750
most part where people are seeing
results is basically calorie restriction

859
00:49:46,990 --> 00:49:49,180
because you're not just,
you're just not eating that many calories.

860
00:49:49,181 --> 00:49:53,710
Meaning only stake in terms of like how
much you're using throughout the day.

861
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:55,840
And a lot of these people
were eating like one,

862
00:49:55,841 --> 00:49:58,360
two meals a day and they're
losing massive amounts of weight.

863
00:49:58,390 --> 00:50:02,140
They're down to the weight they were when
they were 21 and they feel fantastic.

864
00:50:02,350 --> 00:50:06,220
All the gut problems go away.
All the different, you know, uh,

865
00:50:06,310 --> 00:50:09,160
issues they have with auto immune
diseases go away. And she's like,

866
00:50:09,161 --> 00:50:12,190
this is all mimic by calorie
restriction diets. She was like,

867
00:50:12,191 --> 00:50:14,500
this is most likely what
you're experiencing.

868
00:50:14,501 --> 00:50:17,560
And there's a bunch of other nutrition
experts that are sort of examining now

869
00:50:17,561 --> 00:50:20,960
because it's become quite a movement.
This coin award diet,

870
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:23,560
people are like calories
in, calories out, you know,

871
00:50:23,561 --> 00:50:27,680
like 40% of calories from protein are
actually using the breakdown of protein.

872
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,690
So if I eat a hundred calories of protein,

873
00:50:30,470 --> 00:50:33,620
40 of them motherfuckers are used
to actually break down the protein.

874
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:36,470
And then there's a thermogenic effect.
It actually heats the body.

875
00:50:36,471 --> 00:50:39,290
Like you eat a lot of fucking money,
you know, it's your body's hot as fuck.

876
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:43,400
You know what I'm saying? Um, yeah.
That's one of the things they've got it,

877
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:48,260
that's one of the things they
actually recommend. If you're cold,

878
00:50:48,261 --> 00:50:51,370
like if you get drenched,
if you're, you know,

879
00:50:51,810 --> 00:50:55,820
you to rewarm like there's these things
that they do rewarming drills in the

880
00:50:55,821 --> 00:51:00,590
military and they recommend you eating
and eating is a big part of trying to

881
00:51:00,591 --> 00:51:04,550
heat up because your body
starts generating heat to
try to break down the food

882
00:51:04,551 --> 00:51:08,210
that you're taking in so much
that we look into like, you know,

883
00:51:08,211 --> 00:51:10,940
10% of your metabolism actually
comes from breaking down food.

884
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:14,480
10% that's a fuck ton of calories,
man. That's all you know.

885
00:51:14,481 --> 00:51:17,160
And that's when we actually
come to rehydration.

886
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:20,030
Like in terms of the fighters
getting ready for the fight,

887
00:51:20,031 --> 00:51:21,290
we actually take a look at that.
Like,

888
00:51:21,291 --> 00:51:24,890
do you want your body breaking
food down while you were fighting?

889
00:51:24,891 --> 00:51:26,560
And stuff like that, right? You know,

890
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:30,410
your enteric nervous system and your
body's not going to be like, you know,

891
00:51:31,010 --> 00:51:32,780
we're going to break this food
down. I actually, you know,

892
00:51:32,781 --> 00:51:35,150
like with your entire nervous
system is bodies. You know,

893
00:51:35,151 --> 00:51:37,390
if you see a fucking
bear, but it's like, hmm,

894
00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:39,380
we're going to break down food or we're
going to run from the fucking bear.

895
00:51:39,381 --> 00:51:41,290
You know where to fucking run.

896
00:51:41,590 --> 00:51:45,290
So it sends the Nora half
afternoon through the body,
fucking you stop digesting.

897
00:51:45,291 --> 00:51:47,900
But that doesn't, it doesn't mean that's
just not stealing your fucking gut.

898
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:50,840
Right. But with that,
with that being said,

899
00:51:50,841 --> 00:51:53,050
like in terms of the main shit like that.
Yeah man,

900
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:57,020
like a large percentage of that is
actually used to break down foods and it's

901
00:51:57,021 --> 00:51:57,854
like,
uh,

902
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:03,140
we talk about Glucagon and I get so
many fucking people that are like,

903
00:52:03,650 --> 00:52:06,770
that's not how the body works.
You know? Like I, I get,

904
00:52:06,830 --> 00:52:09,680
that's not how the body fuck whores. When
you, when you fucking hate the protein.

905
00:52:09,681 --> 00:52:11,060
Like it's not like your body's like,
oh,

906
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:13,130
we're going to shoot glue gone
through the fucking system,

907
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:17,930
but how many times have you ain't no
fucking high pancake fucking breakfast and

908
00:52:17,931 --> 00:52:22,280
you're like, let's go fucking kick
today's ass. No. You were like, fuck,

909
00:52:22,281 --> 00:52:25,420
let's go back to bed. You have
a big ass omelet. You know,

910
00:52:25,450 --> 00:52:28,310
you're like sucked today's Dick
and let's fucking go kick some ass.

911
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:31,190
You know what I'm saying? Like you have
energy. If this Glucagon's fucking,

912
00:52:31,191 --> 00:52:34,040
you know, through your system obviously
like it's not the way the body works,

913
00:52:34,041 --> 00:52:36,980
but you know, in in, in
essence like when you're,

914
00:52:37,010 --> 00:52:40,030
when you're taking a specific things
at specific times you're going to,

915
00:52:40,031 --> 00:52:44,120
you're going to promote the usage of,
of, of uh, carbohydrates more or less.

916
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:46,550
So those pancakes wouldn't
be a bad thing after workout,

917
00:52:46,610 --> 00:52:49,610
after workout a hundred
percent every now what?

918
00:52:49,850 --> 00:52:53,180
You would haven't wrap that up,
so fruits,

919
00:52:53,181 --> 00:52:56,570
but what other kinds of sugars
do you recommend a guard take?

920
00:52:56,571 --> 00:53:00,140
Postworkout hard workout.
We would give them like,

921
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:04,440
who work with so many guys, like you know,
like they're sponsored by this company,

922
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:06,800
the second company, but we'll give
him whatever the fuck they want.

923
00:53:06,801 --> 00:53:10,580
They're like in terms of the dextrose
and dextrose is just a monosaccharide is

924
00:53:10,581 --> 00:53:13,970
basically just a simple short,
straight away from it. There you go,

925
00:53:15,050 --> 00:53:19,970
bring it to you. It moves. The arm
goes this way, it goes that way.

926
00:53:20,010 --> 00:53:24,410
Joe, me and technologies do not just
keep it near you, just keep it near you.

927
00:53:24,411 --> 00:53:27,750
That's all you do.
You don't have to lean,

928
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,230
break the moves towards you. That's
what I'm trying to say. Look,

929
00:53:31,231 --> 00:53:34,140
grab the arm reaching,
grab the arm towards you

930
00:53:36,270 --> 00:53:38,730
this way because that way it goes back.

931
00:53:40,810 --> 00:53:45,240
Um, and uh, before a fight.
Yeah. What do you have,

932
00:53:45,241 --> 00:53:49,920
like when like say if Connor is going
to fight it, nine PM's the main event,

933
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,250
when do you have them eat and what is,
what do you have in the,

934
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:55,530
so we have to break it down
to the amount of meals, right?

935
00:53:55,531 --> 00:53:59,790
So what we do is you basically find
out the amount of muscle tissue that

936
00:53:59,791 --> 00:54:04,380
individual has. So like he's weighing
what on the day of the fight, one 70 ish.

937
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:09,330
So we have to, it's not necessarily,
you're like, uh, your weight,

938
00:54:09,331 --> 00:54:12,840
but it's your lean muscle tissue. So you
have your lean body mass, right? So if I,

939
00:54:12,870 --> 00:54:15,180
let's say you're 200 pounds,
right? You're 200 pounds.

940
00:54:15,181 --> 00:54:16,620
You didn't say you have 10% body fat.

941
00:54:16,621 --> 00:54:20,520
That means that you're 180% a
180 pounds of lean body mass.

942
00:54:20,850 --> 00:54:23,130
A lot of people were like, oh, that
means I'm 180 pounds of muscle. Now,

943
00:54:23,150 --> 00:54:27,510
that actually means the only 40% of
that is actual lean muscle tissue. Now,

944
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:30,810
each kilogram of lean muscle tissue
holds onto 13 grams of glycogen.

945
00:54:30,811 --> 00:54:31,800
So we have to find that.
Okay,

946
00:54:31,801 --> 00:54:36,300
how much muscle or how much lean
muscle tissues do you hold? All right.

947
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:41,510
Now how do you find that out to 40% do
you have them submerge and nor do I have

948
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:49,140
literally like we've had the,
uh, the hydrostatic testing.

949
00:54:49,141 --> 00:54:53,440
We've done the um, um, the
fuck is that guy, his kindness.

950
00:54:53,910 --> 00:54:56,100
Thank you. Thank you. I
appreciate it. That's what,

951
00:54:56,101 --> 00:54:58,800
that's what you bro Fucking this big
word that scans the one that he used,

952
00:54:58,801 --> 00:55:01,230
the performances that,
I don't think I'm saying that correctly,

953
00:55:01,231 --> 00:55:06,030
but something like that.
$500,000 piece of gear,

954
00:55:06,031 --> 00:55:10,590
right? Fucking there. They're
wrong. 100%, bro. 100%.

955
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:14,190
I literally, here's the thing,
there's things that, you know,

956
00:55:14,191 --> 00:55:15,360
scientifically can't happen.

957
00:55:15,361 --> 00:55:18,180
Your body cannot be anabolic and
catabolic is same fucking time.

958
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:22,680
So if you're like, you know, I got some
of, so many people are like, Hey George,

959
00:55:22,681 --> 00:55:26,390
I want to, I want to gain muscle and lose
fat. And I'm like, so do I, man, I fuck.

960
00:55:26,391 --> 00:55:29,400
I would love that, but it's
impossible. It's impossible.

961
00:55:29,401 --> 00:55:34,380
Your body cannot be anabolic and catabolic
at the same fucking time. Right? Well,

962
00:55:34,381 --> 00:55:37,680
we went, we went into that machine
last year with fucking Carter, right?

963
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:42,390
Showed him and I literally day, I'm
like, that's how good I fucking him.

964
00:55:42,391 --> 00:55:47,160
But it showed him gaining muscle and
losing actual fat. It's impossible.

965
00:55:47,161 --> 00:55:48,810
I'm like those,
those are incorrect.

966
00:55:48,811 --> 00:55:51,750
Those routines possible
over a long period of time.

967
00:55:51,751 --> 00:55:56,100
You're saying obviously some people
do gain muscle and they do lose fat if

968
00:55:56,101 --> 00:55:59,670
someone's on a signage. So if
you get, so here's the thing,

969
00:56:00,090 --> 00:56:04,860
if you gain muscle mass,
your your body fat percentage can go down.

970
00:56:05,150 --> 00:56:08,310
Right? Right, right. So let's
say like, oh, it's like, okay,

971
00:56:08,311 --> 00:56:12,470
I gain five pounds of muscle and I
only gained like a half a pound of fat.

972
00:56:12,650 --> 00:56:16,200
My body fat percentage is going to go
down because your body weight got heavier.

973
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:20,580
100% but did I lose fat?
No, I did not lose fat.

974
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:24,460
If you look at it like, okay, your
body has it makes sense. Yeah. I see.

975
00:56:24,461 --> 00:56:28,510
What your possible. How does
one lose body fat? Well,

976
00:56:28,511 --> 00:56:31,090
you gotta be in the catabolic state.
You gotta be at a deficit,

977
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:36,320
and when you are at a deficit, you're not
going to gain muscle and fat. He said,

978
00:56:36,670 --> 00:56:38,890
yeah,
if anybody says otherwise,

979
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:41,470
they're full of shit and
they're on an infomercial.

980
00:56:41,930 --> 00:56:44,300
But if you buy today for 1999

981
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:49,390
the truth brother,
so that's just how the body works.

982
00:56:49,510 --> 00:56:52,540
The body works in that
if you're gaining muscle,

983
00:56:52,690 --> 00:56:55,240
you might have less percentage of fat,

984
00:56:55,241 --> 00:56:58,540
but that is because your body is
getting heavier, right? Right. Yeah.

985
00:56:58,590 --> 00:57:01,780
You can lean out like your body
fat percentage can go down,

986
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:06,100
but if you look at like a Dexa scan,
it's going to be like, okay, you have,

987
00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:09,970
let's say, yeah, 50 pounds
of fat. It's not going to be
like, it shouldn't be like,

988
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,720
oh, now you have 40 pounds of
fat and more muscle. Right.

989
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,610
100% I see what you're saying.

990
00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:20,910
So you calculate how much lean muscle
mass he has lean muscle tissue,

991
00:57:21,551 --> 00:57:26,530
excuse me. And then you coordinate
his meals accordingly, right? Yeah.

992
00:57:26,570 --> 00:57:28,510
So it's like, okay, well he's
going to fight at this time,

993
00:57:28,511 --> 00:57:29,710
or she's gonna fight at this time.

994
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:33,070
This is the amount of meals that they're
going to have dictated on the amount of,

995
00:57:33,071 --> 00:57:36,190
you know, like after rehydration,
so on and so forth this month,

996
00:57:36,430 --> 00:57:38,950
this amount of carbohydrates
that they actually have to have.

997
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:42,450
And it's funny because men and women are
totally different. Right. You know, man,

998
00:57:42,451 --> 00:57:45,730
he used to work with Cyborg.
I don't work with Cyborg.

999
00:57:45,731 --> 00:57:50,710
That was an extreme weight
cut though, right? Yeah. We'll
go with that. Yeah. Yeah.

1000
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:55,450
I mean, yeah, she's, yeah, she's, it
was tough. Chris is a, is a, is a,

1001
00:57:56,080 --> 00:58:00,850
I mean, it's no fucking sign,
you know, she's a big girl,
you know what I mean? Like,

1002
00:58:00,851 --> 00:58:05,750
you know, so she walked around that I,

1003
00:58:05,770 --> 00:58:06,820
you know,
I don't remember,

1004
00:58:06,821 --> 00:58:11,821
but I think it was like in the 70s she
got all the way down to one 41 time.

1005
00:58:12,131 --> 00:58:16,060
We make any fucking sense when they
were making her do that. I was like,

1006
00:58:16,061 --> 00:58:18,730
why are you making her do that when you
don't even have a goddamn weight class

1007
00:58:18,731 --> 00:58:20,110
for it?
I was like,

1008
00:58:20,111 --> 00:58:24,970
are you making her do that to show that
she's close to one 35 cents like there's

1009
00:58:24,971 --> 00:58:28,450
a one 45 you could five or
fight at one 45 no, no, no.

1010
00:58:28,690 --> 00:58:33,670
One 40 like what? There's no one 40 weight
class. Right, right. It doesn't exist.

1011
00:58:33,690 --> 00:58:36,550
Right. It's so weird. That was so weird.

1012
00:58:36,551 --> 00:58:41,551
Was there and I would see her like the
videos of her fucking crying and trying

1013
00:58:42,490 --> 00:58:45,760
to get her down to that weight. I
was like, that's insane. Yeah, no,

1014
00:58:45,761 --> 00:58:49,270
it's a it definitely, hey, you know
like with every weight cut man,

1015
00:58:49,271 --> 00:58:53,530
it's fucking tough. You know like, well
Chris, like me and her got, we got close.

1016
00:58:53,540 --> 00:58:56,110
I think we got a little bit too close.
You know? That's one thing I learned.

1017
00:58:56,111 --> 00:58:59,200
Like I had to keep a, I have to have
a separation. You know what I mean?

1018
00:58:59,201 --> 00:59:01,730
Cause like when you're like get
the in a bath like right. You know,

1019
00:59:01,930 --> 00:59:04,070
you have to have that. And with
her I was like, man we were,

1020
00:59:04,071 --> 00:59:07,780
we were so close as friends. I was like,
fuck dude. Like I see what you're saying.

1021
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:11,890
He can't get hardcore. Yeah,
I do too with women too.

1022
00:59:11,891 --> 00:59:16,390
I'm fucking horrible. Debate a
bitch, right? Girls. I'm like,

1023
00:59:16,470 --> 00:59:21,320
aw man. Fuck Dude. What are you crying?
We don't really have to do this. Do Lie.

1024
00:59:22,910 --> 00:59:25,460
Right, right. Yeah.

1025
00:59:25,790 --> 00:59:30,320
Who's the hardest that you've ever had
to lose weight? Fucking Vick. James Guy.

1026
00:59:30,330 --> 00:59:35,240
Damn van. Why Bitch? He's six
[inaudible] four or finding out what? 55.

1027
00:59:35,330 --> 00:59:39,510
He's a big fellow. He got
to got DM. Sweet teeth. Uh,

1028
00:59:40,170 --> 00:59:43,410
George touch. Come on, man. Let me ask
some Oreos like after he makes weight.

1029
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:47,090
Doesn't mean it's more years. We have,
we have, we have a little, you know,

1030
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:50,330
getting over there. All right.
You get to Oreos if you do this.

1031
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:54,680
You walk around that, um, he's
in the 90s, man. Jesus Christ.

1032
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:58,190
How much do you think that
affects his actual performance?

1033
00:59:58,490 --> 01:00:03,320
Do you think that hinders him talking
business or I'm talking reality. Reality.

1034
01:00:04,370 --> 01:00:07,780
Yeah, of course. Man. It's so, it's a
point of diminishing returns, right?

1035
01:00:07,781 --> 01:00:09,920
Like you've got to figure out
when do you hit that point?

1036
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:14,600
Cause you look at guys like Dustin
poray done much better at one 55. Yeah,

1037
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:17,780
it looks better than, I mean I work
with, you know, I'll never forget,

1038
01:00:17,781 --> 01:00:20,930
like I worked with Dustin when he first
got into you a sheet and they were like,

1039
01:00:20,931 --> 01:00:25,640
it needs to be one 45 in 21 days.
Like, let's fucking do it man.

1040
01:00:25,670 --> 01:00:29,710
You don't like him and fucking um,
you know, so many motherfuckers,

1041
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:32,120
you know what I mean? You, you're
absolutely right. You know,

1042
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:34,310
you look at that Calvin Gosh to them,
you know,

1043
01:00:34,730 --> 01:00:38,900
people don't realize like the point of a
fight camp is not to make weight at the

1044
01:00:38,901 --> 01:00:42,200
point of the fight camp is to increase
your skill, increase your ability.

1045
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:44,870
Like it should be pure design session.
You know what I'm saying?

1046
01:00:44,871 --> 01:00:49,400
We're talking about like the big beef,
no big motherfuckers that like, yeah,

1047
01:00:49,401 --> 01:00:51,240
you're like, this guy's the
strength and conditioning coach.

1048
01:00:51,241 --> 01:00:54,480
You don't know shit about periodization.
Do you work with Calvin? Yeah,

1049
01:00:55,060 --> 01:00:58,420
we've worked together a lot and
it's, you know, like now, um,

1050
01:00:58,670 --> 01:01:01,820
we don't work so much together.
You know, like when he was,

1051
01:01:02,150 --> 01:01:04,820
and that's one of the things like a lot
of guys will work with us when they have

1052
01:01:04,821 --> 01:01:08,510
to make weight. There's certain guys
like Frankie Edgar, Edgar's like, dude,

1053
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:11,750
he invests in himself.
He knows that like does he,

1054
01:01:11,751 --> 01:01:15,140
I mean he shows up almost on weight,
but he's, it's all about performance.

1055
01:01:15,141 --> 01:01:17,700
He knows that, you know what
I mean? Same thing with the,

1056
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:22,700
well he's the guy who fought at one 55
when he really was one 55 I ain't get him

1057
01:01:22,701 --> 01:01:24,580
to one 25 problem walks.

1058
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:29,580
He's Day one 25 because
people were talking about
him fighting at one 35 you're

1059
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:33,800
saying you could get them to fight 100%
flyweight on a messiah. But you know,

1060
01:01:33,801 --> 01:01:34,431
and then people was like,

1061
01:01:34,431 --> 01:01:39,250
well I'm black and I'm like this if was
my first whooping ass at one 45 1155

1062
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:41,030
like when they were talking about
like, Oh, you just get more,

1063
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:42,800
and he was a champion at one 55 I'm like,

1064
01:01:42,801 --> 01:01:46,400
why the fuck am I going to try and
cut this guy if he's a champion?

1065
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:47,241
You know what I mean?

1066
01:01:47,241 --> 01:01:52,241
Like God cause he wouldn't be the champ
champions now I know like one 2,500 you

1067
01:01:52,971 --> 01:01:57,190
think so bro. Have you talked to him
about this? A Little Frankie homocide?

1068
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:01,880
No I haven't. I never asked. I will
never ask him. I will never sit down.

1069
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:05,630
If Frankie was like George Georgia want
to get to one 25 I'm like thank God or

1070
01:02:05,780 --> 01:02:07,040
thank goodness.
Right.

1071
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:10,160
But he's never asked me so I'll
never bring you work with Tj.

1072
01:02:10,870 --> 01:02:15,230
I have worked with Tj, I dealt, me
and him are good friends and this,

1073
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:18,890
this thing with me, Joe, like
I work with fucking everybody.

1074
01:02:19,020 --> 01:02:23,390
So like in terms of politics,
like I'm like I'm dirty little slut.

1075
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:24,990
It goes from one room to the next.

1076
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:28,730
You know what I'm wearing right now and
then go to the next [inaudible] dirty

1077
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:30,300
bastard,
you know and it's fucking horrible.

1078
01:02:30,810 --> 01:02:34,260
Did they allow that more so with
you because it's a weight cut thing.

1079
01:02:34,261 --> 01:02:36,060
It's not like you're,
you're not teaching,

1080
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:38,250
it's not like you work with Tj and you go,
oh,

1081
01:02:38,251 --> 01:02:41,820
I know Tj is tendencies and then
you work with another guy. I'm not,

1082
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:45,060
I'm not training you to
be a specific individual,

1083
01:02:45,090 --> 01:02:47,340
you training PR person
to make a specific way.

1084
01:02:47,660 --> 01:02:51,210
What I tell people is I'm making
you the best you that I can be.

1085
01:02:51,420 --> 01:02:55,350
And in terms of business, I'm like,
don't you want to beat the best of them?

1086
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:58,710
And they're like, fuck yeah.
All right, so it's okay.

1087
01:02:58,711 --> 01:03:01,960
So that's why they're okay with it.
That's interesting. That's like,

1088
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:06,270
that's a rare section of the
sport where you can do that 100%,

1089
01:03:06,690 --> 01:03:10,600
but you have to like it. I've
had, you know, we have a pretty,

1090
01:03:11,260 --> 01:03:13,350
we have an awesome team, you
know what I mean? But, uh,

1091
01:03:13,650 --> 01:03:17,550
as one thing I have to tell them because
they get so fucking, uh, you know,

1092
01:03:17,551 --> 01:03:20,100
like when you're with a, with a fighter
for a camp, you get super close.

1093
01:03:20,101 --> 01:03:22,720
And I'm like, Bro, like it's fine to
get close with them, but it's, it's,

1094
01:03:22,721 --> 01:03:24,000
it's okay to root for them.

1095
01:03:24,270 --> 01:03:27,600
But we never get to a point where we
route and we talk shit about the other

1096
01:03:27,601 --> 01:03:31,080
fucker team because Jazz, Oh, we work
with them and we work with, could be,

1097
01:03:31,170 --> 01:03:34,530
you know what I mean? For, for a
long time. You know what I mean?

1098
01:03:35,010 --> 01:03:39,240
So who does he work with? No,
I don't know. I have no idea.

1099
01:03:39,390 --> 01:03:42,990
And he's had some real struggles.
He's had some tough cuts, man.

1100
01:03:43,130 --> 01:03:47,550
He's a tough motherfucker. What
was he doing wrong? Everything.

1101
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:52,470
Everything. You know, and it's funny
because I, I think that it's, uh, there's,

1102
01:03:52,471 --> 01:03:55,150
there's like a language barrier
and the thing, but you don't like,

1103
01:03:55,190 --> 01:03:58,860
there's also like, um, let's say you're
cutting weight, right? And you're,

1104
01:03:58,861 --> 01:04:01,380
you're looking at like, okay,
common sense, if I drink water,

1105
01:04:01,381 --> 01:04:04,170
I'm going to fucking be heavier.
Right? So fuck drinking water.

1106
01:04:04,530 --> 01:04:08,610
But you don't realize you got your Renin
Angiotensin aldosterone system that's

1107
01:04:08,611 --> 01:04:12,150
fucking going to be activated if
you fucking cut back water early.

1108
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:14,760
People don't realize that Shit,
man. You know what I'm saying?

1109
01:04:14,761 --> 01:04:19,380
So what they do is eat. Your body tries
to hold onto that water. Everything.

1110
01:04:19,381 --> 01:04:21,720
Everything in your body is created
from a stimulus. You know what I mean?

1111
01:04:21,721 --> 01:04:24,660
Like first email that says
your hot right when you're hot,

1112
01:04:24,661 --> 01:04:28,920
what is your body dude?
It's fucking sweat. And then
what happens? Well, Oh shit.

1113
01:04:28,921 --> 01:04:30,300
Like my body's dehydrated.

1114
01:04:30,301 --> 01:04:33,220
Blood pressure started dropping
and he starts releasing a Adh.

1115
01:04:33,221 --> 01:04:37,740
She starts releasing, uh, um,
you know, uh, aldosterone,

1116
01:04:37,770 --> 01:04:40,630
shit like that in fucking, you
mention from sweating, you know,

1117
01:04:40,740 --> 01:04:44,880
so then I'll look at that. But they
look at it, he's like, I drink water,

1118
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:48,360
puts weight on.
We're going to start drinking water early.

1119
01:04:48,450 --> 01:04:52,890
How long have you been working with
Konner? Um, since the Josie Aldo, who's a,

1120
01:04:52,891 --> 01:04:55,670
that was the first time I
worked with Josie Aldo for some,

1121
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:58,230
it's been quite a long time. Yeah. Yeah.

1122
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:01,410
How much of a difference has it made,
John?

1123
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:06,880
And it's huge because until then
I was winging it. You know, it,

1124
01:05:06,881 --> 01:05:11,700
that the way quitting parts of the
sport is cloaks and daggers and you're

1125
01:05:11,701 --> 01:05:16,530
trying, you're overhearing conversations
and you're googling. So, you know, I was,

1126
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:17,513
it was,
was

1127
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:21,250
pretty much guesswork on,
on, on, on my end. You know,

1128
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:24,550
I got him to one 45,
um,

1129
01:05:24,790 --> 01:05:28,580
nearly 20 times on my own, but
when we brought George and, uh,

1130
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:30,170
and it wasn't even just
about making weight,

1131
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:34,330
what I noticed with him was
that every session was um,

1132
01:05:35,020 --> 01:05:37,180
productive.
There was no sessions where it was,

1133
01:05:37,270 --> 01:05:41,080
he didn't have to pop in the
shots or soreness or you know,

1134
01:05:41,140 --> 01:05:42,550
that that would just be a normal part.

1135
01:05:42,551 --> 01:05:46,030
Whereas when we brought in
George and that, that was a lot,

1136
01:05:46,390 --> 01:05:48,010
each session was a lot more effective.

1137
01:05:48,011 --> 01:05:52,660
So it wasn't just about making the way
it was making the training camp and where

1138
01:05:52,661 --> 01:05:56,860
he was improving the Holloway truest.
He got down to one 45 a couple times.

1139
01:05:57,160 --> 01:06:02,010
He looked like, like a monster. You look
like a Zombie. It was terrifying. Yeah.

1140
01:06:02,350 --> 01:06:02,800
Yeah.

1141
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:06,880
I mean that how to play a big part in
your decision to no longer have him fight

1142
01:06:06,881 --> 01:06:09,570
it that way. Yeah. Yeah. I mean,
we'd already gone with the wind.

1143
01:06:09,571 --> 01:06:14,571
55 is his final flight before going to
the UFC was was at one 55 and I was kind

1144
01:06:14,641 --> 01:06:17,170
of like, oh thank God, you know, this
is just to see what in the better,

1145
01:06:17,171 --> 01:06:20,470
because when he joined he was a
sort of a scrawny 16, 17 year old.

1146
01:06:20,770 --> 01:06:24,040
But when he started becoming a man,
so getting down there,

1147
01:06:24,041 --> 01:06:27,190
it was getting scarier and scarier.
And then his last fight outside of UFC,

1148
01:06:27,191 --> 01:06:31,030
I thought you looked fantastic.
It was a handy way coat. Um,

1149
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:33,880
and he just looked at it,
looked like a tank.

1150
01:06:34,330 --> 01:06:37,150
Now the offer came in a
couple of weeks later,

1151
01:06:37,151 --> 01:06:42,040
Sean emailed me and said
that we're offering you at
one 45 fight in a, in April.

1152
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:45,520
And of course I tell Connor and
he's screaming and running around.

1153
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:48,970
We didn't care what weight class. If he
had to say, well in 25 we would have,

1154
01:06:49,180 --> 01:06:52,930
we would have done it.
John specifically want as as a one 45.

1155
01:06:53,470 --> 01:06:55,880
And we sort of went, we
went back to, you know,

1156
01:06:56,180 --> 01:06:59,170
back to that lighter weight class
and it was almost accidental.

1157
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:01,360
And then soon as we got the opportunity,

1158
01:07:01,630 --> 01:07:04,400
you went back up again and he
looked very thick at the weigh ins.

1159
01:07:04,540 --> 01:07:08,370
He looks heavier, he looks bigger. Yeah.
And it, you know that that's a part of a,

1160
01:07:08,410 --> 01:07:10,030
you know,
the lifecycle of an athlete.

1161
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:13,540
If you're with the same guy for over
a decade, you're going to see changes.

1162
01:07:13,870 --> 01:07:15,940
You know, he's Turkey
now, he's not 18 anymore.

1163
01:07:15,941 --> 01:07:20,010
It's it there these different things going
on in his life. So if, you know, it's,

1164
01:07:20,050 --> 01:07:23,230
that's the benefit I think of working
with someone for a long period of time

1165
01:07:23,231 --> 01:07:25,890
rather than, you know, kind
of Jim hopping that you,

1166
01:07:26,210 --> 01:07:28,600
you'll know what they can and can't do.

1167
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:32,260
And he does a lot of
unconventional training. Right.

1168
01:07:32,261 --> 01:07:34,590
In terms of like physical conditioning,
like I know he,

1169
01:07:34,650 --> 01:07:38,890
is he still doing all that stuff with
Ido Portal? Yeah. Anytime. Ito's in, in,

1170
01:07:38,891 --> 01:07:41,140
in Europe.
Ped tends to drop in Ireland.

1171
01:07:41,141 --> 01:07:44,080
We have a great relationship with them
and he'll play around with that. I,

1172
01:07:44,670 --> 01:07:45,910
you know,
the reality is he's,

1173
01:07:46,150 --> 01:07:50,260
most of our time is going to be
spent on the fundamentals of MMA.

1174
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:54,400
And the great thing with Ito is he's,
he, especially in training camp,

1175
01:07:54,401 --> 01:07:57,400
he will come in and near the end
where you're just tired of doing,

1176
01:07:57,401 --> 01:08:00,730
seem to like defense. You're tired
of doing pad work and he comes in,

1177
01:08:00,731 --> 01:08:03,700
he does all these fun games. So
we're still working out. We're still,

1178
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,650
he's firing his brain in different ways.

1179
01:08:05,651 --> 01:08:09,220
He's where he's working in coordination
and balance for me is the, you know,

1180
01:08:09,221 --> 01:08:13,470
the head trainer. It's like, it's
a nice break, you know, is a, um,

1181
01:08:13,570 --> 01:08:16,070
I'm sure it was John, John
Wayne her and say to, you know,

1182
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:18,410
when you have a fight coming up, you
know how many miles you're going to run.

1183
01:08:18,410 --> 01:08:21,060
You know, how many kicks you're
going to trow every now and again.

1184
01:08:21,061 --> 01:08:24,050
Do you want to come in and want to do
so long back, uh, jumping in the air,

1185
01:08:24,051 --> 01:08:28,570
spinning Albert's itself, it breaks
the monotony and MMA is fantastic,

1186
01:08:28,940 --> 01:08:31,080
you know, cause it's all the
martial arts together. It's,

1187
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:34,130
you're almost never going to get forward
because you can always do something

1188
01:08:34,131 --> 01:08:35,750
different,
but it's still,

1189
01:08:35,751 --> 01:08:39,860
there's still a repetitiveness to it
that it's nice to break with something

1190
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:44,540
unusual. Now, how much does
training change when you're
dealing with a specialist,

1191
01:08:44,570 --> 01:08:49,220
like a guy like could be who is
just, uh, uh, grappling phenom?

1192
01:08:49,490 --> 01:08:54,290
How much do you shift the emphasis
of the training to take down defense,

1193
01:08:54,470 --> 01:08:59,180
working on grappling and do you work
mostly take down defense or do you just

1194
01:08:59,181 --> 01:09:03,740
work overall wrestling? So the take down
defense becomes a part of that as well.

1195
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:07,820
Um, all of that, all that. Um, but yeah,

1196
01:09:07,821 --> 01:09:11,110
definitely I would maybe talk about later,
like I,

1197
01:09:11,180 --> 01:09:14,270
if there's one thing I could change is
that I think I was too defensive in my

1198
01:09:14,271 --> 01:09:17,240
mindset for this training camp. But, uh,

1199
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:20,510
Habib has very specific types of
take downs depending on where he is,

1200
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:23,300
whether it's shooting on the
low single London in the middle.

1201
01:09:23,540 --> 01:09:26,930
And then on the fence. I, I, you know,
long before Congress do to fight them.

1202
01:09:26,931 --> 01:09:29,480
I loved watching him. Um, that's
kind of my areas. The fence.

1203
01:09:29,481 --> 01:09:33,950
I just love you right from the Randy
couture days, how to use the fence and,

1204
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:38,600
and peep does it too, you
know, a new level, um, you
know, wanting to take downs.

1205
01:09:38,601 --> 01:09:41,410
He hidden Connor. You hadn't actually
done it until the eloquent defy.

1206
01:09:41,450 --> 01:09:44,410
So it's nice that we kind of got to
see that at the high crotch. I was,

1207
01:09:44,650 --> 01:09:47,960
I'd say a bit of DC and that the high
crotch and then trip on the far leg.

1208
01:09:47,961 --> 01:09:51,220
And I think he blocked the wounds, but
he did catch him with it. So, you know,

1209
01:09:51,221 --> 01:09:53,630
it was very specific.
Takedowns um,

1210
01:09:53,660 --> 01:09:56,390
definitely for this training camp
was the most specific that we went.

1211
01:09:57,380 --> 01:10:00,230
And then I remember about a
week out or whenever it was,

1212
01:10:00,231 --> 01:10:04,280
he did an interview and he said, well,
if he doesn't make it a fight, Tony,

1213
01:10:04,281 --> 01:10:06,590
I don't care who it is.
And I was going to damn it.

1214
01:10:07,340 --> 01:10:09,110
I hadn't even looked at
Tony's fights in so long.

1215
01:10:09,111 --> 01:10:13,430
So me and the other coaches
like start like, okay, what
does he do again? Oh yeah.

1216
01:10:13,431 --> 01:10:17,510
He has that style. And because
we work so specific for this one,

1217
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:22,220
um, Tony could possibly be a fight
in the future. When you, when you,

1218
01:10:22,250 --> 01:10:25,810
when you think about the future now, after
the [inaudible] fight, how, what do you,

1219
01:10:25,850 --> 01:10:28,970
what are you thinking? Are you
thinking about, uh, just to rest,

1220
01:10:29,210 --> 01:10:33,320
let the dust settle and then look at
the landscape? Like what, how did,

1221
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:35,510
how did you approach it?
I might put, he doesn't,

1222
01:10:35,930 --> 01:10:38,960
what is he screaming and shouting
for the rematch within minutes?

1223
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:43,100
It's hard to push for that rematch
though, after that fight. Right? Sure. No,

1224
01:10:43,190 --> 01:10:47,300
I understand the logic of that. You
know, Tony's kind of errands and stuff,

1225
01:10:47,301 --> 01:10:50,190
but I also understand
this is a business and

1226
01:10:51,870 --> 01:10:55,580
it will be a huge fight. You know, the
rematch would be a huge fight. Does it,

1227
01:10:55,581 --> 01:11:00,581
don't you think that it would be difficult
to sell because of how dominant could

1228
01:11:00,741 --> 01:11:03,920
be, wasn't that fight? I'm sure. Uh,

1229
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:08,900
I do think the ground Trey showed
promise. Um, I, I, like I said,

1230
01:11:08,901 --> 01:11:11,960
I would like to have change
things up a little bit.

1231
01:11:12,350 --> 01:11:16,860
Specifically a more offensive
mindset. I've taught
defensively, we did quite well.

1232
01:11:17,210 --> 01:11:21,820
Um, but offensively we weren't
really where we usually are and,

1233
01:11:21,830 --> 01:11:24,570
and you know, right when the fight was
over, I was thinking, you know what,

1234
01:11:24,990 --> 01:11:29,190
I was kind of going into this like
not to lose, not to win, you know,

1235
01:11:29,191 --> 01:11:32,040
and his shots warden as
crisp as they normally are,

1236
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:34,650
he had opportunities to hit him,
especially into turned round.

1237
01:11:34,950 --> 01:11:39,950
And he just seemed to be the range of
something was off and that he had to do

1238
01:11:40,651 --> 01:11:44,260
with the fact that he hadn't fought at
my main two years. Absolutely. You know,

1239
01:11:44,261 --> 01:11:45,960
I'd say right. Yeah, of course. Of course.

1240
01:11:45,961 --> 01:11:48,480
And we tried to mimic as
close as we could in the gym.

1241
01:11:48,481 --> 01:11:52,470
And I brought in guys that he didn't
know and I would say, this is fight day,

1242
01:11:52,471 --> 01:11:53,221
and he didn't you,
you know,

1243
01:11:53,221 --> 01:11:55,980
he would do with George exactly what
going to do on fight day and we'd have a

1244
01:11:55,981 --> 01:12:00,210
referee and so to, to, to get the fight
feel, but it's still in the gym, which,

1245
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:01,350
you know,

1246
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:06,350
is he at a position now where every fight
has to be a gigantic super fight in?

1247
01:12:06,690 --> 01:12:11,040
Is that nes, is that a problem in that,
you know what, I thought after the fight,

1248
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:13,800
after it was all over, I was like,
you know what a good fight would be,

1249
01:12:14,060 --> 01:12:15,390
would be him versus Pettis.

1250
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:19,530
Like that would be a really good fight
and it would be a really interesting

1251
01:12:19,531 --> 01:12:23,520
fight in terms of stylistic matchup
and it would be a great fight,

1252
01:12:23,610 --> 01:12:28,610
I think for Connor to sort of just get
a wild three round or I guess it would

1253
01:12:28,621 --> 01:12:30,270
probably be the main event.
It would be five rounds,

1254
01:12:30,271 --> 01:12:35,250
but oh well it would be a wild fight.
They would probably favor him. Yeah. Yeah.

1255
01:12:35,251 --> 01:12:39,470
I mean, the boxing have, you
know, in Tyson fury was kind
of coming back together.

1256
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:42,390
Um, you know, not the toughest guy
in the world. It doesn't happen.

1257
01:12:42,391 --> 01:12:46,440
It never doesn't happen to them.
It may specifically specifically to USC,

1258
01:12:46,950 --> 01:12:50,850
and there's an issue with that
I think. Yeah. You know, he was,

1259
01:12:52,100 --> 01:12:52,410
you know,

1260
01:12:52,410 --> 01:12:57,210
at an early stage it was fighting
all the time and as it as natural,

1261
01:12:57,211 --> 01:13:00,780
as you get older and as you achieve more,
it is going to start becoming, you know,

1262
01:13:00,781 --> 01:13:04,050
once or twice a year. Right. That's just
a natural progression of an athlete.

1263
01:13:04,051 --> 01:13:04,920
I don't care who you are,

1264
01:13:05,010 --> 01:13:09,120
but the wild fights that he
could have at 155 pounds,

1265
01:13:09,121 --> 01:13:14,121
whether it's James Vick or just engage g
or pedis or there's good fights for him

1266
01:13:14,990 --> 01:13:18,360
that aren't necessarily could be,
they aren't necessarily Tony Ferguson,

1267
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:22,020
but they're a good fight
to get that timing back,

1268
01:13:22,021 --> 01:13:24,390
get everything locked in,
you know,

1269
01:13:24,420 --> 01:13:27,570
100% but you have to
factor in his personality.

1270
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:30,990
And he's only fighting now for flights
that are really interesting to him.

1271
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:35,040
He's not that interest in anybody. Not
that I've heard in May where the paper,

1272
01:13:35,190 --> 01:13:39,780
Oh yeah, yeah. Money, money,
money, money. Right. So,

1273
01:13:39,781 --> 01:13:44,100
you know. Yeah. What more can
he, you know, even with his
spending, well, can I play,

1274
01:13:44,110 --> 01:13:48,330
would be the, the eye on the future and
on the eye, on the rematch, you know,

1275
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:52,230
like getting everything dialed in so
that when he does have a rematch with

1276
01:13:52,231 --> 01:13:55,890
Khabib, he is Samurai
sword sharp. Yes sir. Yeah.

1277
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:58,680
As opposed to having two years off,
one,

1278
01:13:58,681 --> 01:14:03,681
one boxing fight in between them and
then such a grappling heavy contest.

1279
01:14:04,860 --> 01:14:08,370
Yeah. I don't disagree. That would be a
trainer. You know, for me as a trainer,

1280
01:14:08,371 --> 01:14:11,140
that would be the ideal, but it'll
be hard to motivate him for that.

1281
01:14:11,141 --> 01:14:14,240
I think it would be hard to motivate
them and it's, it's not the, you know,

1282
01:14:14,260 --> 01:14:17,500
it's not really the AOC model. It's
was obvious it was going to be though.

1283
01:14:17,530 --> 01:14:19,330
You know what I mean?
It was going to be those things.

1284
01:14:19,420 --> 01:14:24,190
Anybody could tell the UFC what time
it is. It's Conor could be a time,

1285
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:29,260
I mean, if anybody is the guy that
can say, hey, this is what I want,

1286
01:14:29,261 --> 01:14:33,880
I want a fucking tune up fight. I wanna
I want a tough guy. He absolutely could.

1287
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:37,330
Yeah. And he absolutely wouldn't,
you know, who is like when, when,

1288
01:14:37,331 --> 01:14:42,010
when he lost the Diaz one
fight and a backstage,

1289
01:14:42,011 --> 01:14:43,230
he was screaming and shouting.

1290
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:47,380
I at all the tough process of it getting
the rematch at one 70 as quick as

1291
01:14:47,381 --> 01:14:50,260
possible. I'm on, I'm in the
background going, please don't,

1292
01:14:51,190 --> 01:14:56,170
did you not see that
fight? He's a terrifying, a
individual that's got a one 55,

1293
01:14:56,171 --> 01:14:59,110
five and then, okay,
maybe you meet him again.

1294
01:14:59,111 --> 01:15:03,480
But he was not letting that go.
And then four months later he fought the,

1295
01:15:03,481 --> 01:15:06,610
the exact same guy where that's
where he is right now with could be.

1296
01:15:07,330 --> 01:15:10,150
That's all I, that's all I'm
hearing from these. Well listen,

1297
01:15:10,151 --> 01:15:11,650
you could sell it for sure.

1298
01:15:11,740 --> 01:15:15,910
Especially with the fucking
chaos after the fight. You know,

1299
01:15:16,060 --> 01:15:20,590
just keep dealing Dannis at
home. Yeah. He's grounded.

1300
01:15:21,310 --> 01:15:26,050
Yeah. So with what would
you do differently? Um,

1301
01:15:26,110 --> 01:15:29,560
like I said from it from a strategy point
of view and my number one thing would

1302
01:15:29,561 --> 01:15:33,940
be to be more to think more offensively
that we definitely had opportunities to

1303
01:15:33,941 --> 01:15:36,720
learn shots on when Connor
land shot, you know, you know,

1304
01:15:36,790 --> 01:15:39,760
watch the Eddie fight back again. It's,
it doesn't take them a whole lot of shots.

1305
01:15:40,330 --> 01:15:44,800
He rarely misses, you know, even if, if
you look at strikes that it didn't land,

1306
01:15:44,801 --> 01:15:48,490
those strikes were for a reason. They
were to see what way he holds his hand.

1307
01:15:48,491 --> 01:15:49,710
See where your meals,
like you know,

1308
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:52,270
I used to love watching Anderson silver
back in the day and I thought they were,

1309
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:53,770
you know,
they have a similar kind of approach.

1310
01:15:54,610 --> 01:15:57,070
But this one we just didn't
seem to be landing in my,

1311
01:15:57,071 --> 01:15:59,140
only when I look back
at the training camp,

1312
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:03,610
we did spend most of her time
with a defensive mindset and,

1313
01:16:03,611 --> 01:16:04,990
and I think that's a mistake,

1314
01:16:05,230 --> 01:16:08,530
but don't you think that a big part
of it also was that he had to be tired

1315
01:16:08,531 --> 01:16:13,390
because could be be so such a Mauler a
hundred percent I mean handle to have

1316
01:16:13,391 --> 01:16:16,650
some sort of an effect on his ability
to land those shots. Yeah, yeah.

1317
01:16:16,780 --> 01:16:20,770
I'm sure that did. And that was part of
the strategy for one and two, you know,

1318
01:16:20,860 --> 01:16:24,490
if we did end up in our backs was not
to put a massive amount of effort into

1319
01:16:24,491 --> 01:16:27,670
getting up, just play guard and,
and stay safe because you know,

1320
01:16:27,671 --> 01:16:30,370
the next round starts on the feet
and tried to do damage there,

1321
01:16:30,670 --> 01:16:32,540
but it's still tiring.
You know, I, I, you know,

1322
01:16:32,730 --> 01:16:36,880
kind of gets a hard time about as a
vet is cardio all the time, but who is,

1323
01:16:36,881 --> 01:16:41,530
could be faced that didn't look like
that after two rounds and Quinta I quit.

1324
01:16:41,531 --> 01:16:45,940
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I was super
impressed with ally Quinta in that fight.

1325
01:16:45,990 --> 01:16:49,750
It especially considering he came
into that fight looking for a third,

1326
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:52,600
a three round fight. I mean that
was what he was trained for, right?

1327
01:16:52,620 --> 01:16:55,780
He was trained for a three round fight
and it changes up and all of a sudden

1328
01:16:55,781 --> 01:16:59,130
he's in a five round fight for
the title. Fucking crazy. Yeah.

1329
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:02,890
Crazy set of circumstances.
But it almost makes you wonder,

1330
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:07,720
and this is B, you could speak to
this better than anybody. How much,

1331
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:10,130
how much is much and

1332
01:17:10,230 --> 01:17:12,260
in regard to training
for a fight like this,

1333
01:17:12,261 --> 01:17:16,760
like maybe training for a three round
fight is the way to go when you have to

1334
01:17:16,761 --> 01:17:19,670
fight a five round fight so
you're not so fucking beat up.

1335
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:23,780
By the time you get to the fight, if you
already know how to fight five rounds,

1336
01:17:23,781 --> 01:17:24,601
you've already done it.

1337
01:17:24,601 --> 01:17:28,370
And if you're a guy like Conor was just
got so much experience in the game,

1338
01:17:28,610 --> 01:17:33,530
it might be that it's like there's a
point of diminishing returns in terms of

1339
01:17:33,531 --> 01:17:38,360
your strength and conditioning and that
guys just go too far pushed too hard and

1340
01:17:38,361 --> 01:17:40,370
just don't have it when it comes to,

1341
01:17:40,371 --> 01:17:44,630
I mean how many times have you seen a
fighter be overtrained when they fight?

1342
01:17:45,980 --> 01:17:48,230
Very often. Definitely. You know, they've,

1343
01:17:48,231 --> 01:17:51,680
they've given their best rounds and the
gym and it's very difficult as well in

1344
01:17:51,681 --> 01:17:54,410
those last two weeks because
anxiety is starting to grow.

1345
01:17:54,860 --> 01:17:56,000
So you want to train harder,

1346
01:17:56,560 --> 01:18:00,230
you'd want to get one more aspiring and
you want to know because the flights

1347
01:18:00,231 --> 01:18:02,170
coming in. So it's almost like
when you were back in school,

1348
01:18:02,171 --> 01:18:03,530
then you were cramming for an exam.

1349
01:18:04,340 --> 01:18:07,090
The exam's tomorrow I'm going to
stay up all night studying. You know,

1350
01:18:07,460 --> 01:18:10,280
it actually got me through college,
so that works so much. But,

1351
01:18:10,430 --> 01:18:13,220
but in fighting we got to do, we've got
to do the opposite. We don't have it.

1352
01:18:13,250 --> 01:18:15,050
We've got to have a
solid taper off period.

1353
01:18:15,530 --> 01:18:19,690
And that is hard when you're dealing
with a 20 something year old man and he's

1354
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:23,190
dealing with what's, what's coming around
the corner. So, but you know, that's,

1355
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:26,920
that's the trainer's job. You know, how
much did he taper off for this fight? Uh,

1356
01:18:27,020 --> 01:18:27,681
same as usual.

1357
01:18:27,681 --> 01:18:32,120
We have about a two week taper off period
where we start bringing it down. Um,

1358
01:18:32,330 --> 01:18:36,880
he did that. He did actually spar
even after that. Um, you know, we're,

1359
01:18:37,020 --> 01:18:39,570
we're all working very hard for
this fight in the limit, you know,

1360
01:18:39,620 --> 01:18:42,170
somewhat limited period
of time. Um, so we did,

1361
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:44,390
didn't taper off quite the
way we would normally do,

1362
01:18:44,391 --> 01:18:47,870
but roughly two weeks if
you want to do a rematch.

1363
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:49,640
And if the UFC did grant a didn't,

1364
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:54,680
this is obviously dependent upon how
the Nevada state athletic commission

1365
01:18:54,681 --> 01:18:59,080
handles the legal ramifications of him
jumping out of the cage, attacking Dylan,

1366
01:18:59,081 --> 01:19:02,780
Dan as the subsequent brawl.
The chaos that ensued.

1367
01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:08,170
You mean you're, you're dealing with
a lot of legal shit, his fight that,

1368
01:19:08,250 --> 01:19:12,270
that could hold things up. I mean, they
held both guys person is correct. Uh,

1369
01:19:12,330 --> 01:19:15,640
well he held a Habib's kind of got
his, yeah. Okay. Kind of got his purse

1370
01:19:17,350 --> 01:19:20,240
so he gets his first and Colby.
But I mean,

1371
01:19:20,241 --> 01:19:23,430
who the fuck knows what's going to
happen with him, you know, and uh, yeah.

1372
01:19:23,490 --> 01:19:27,150
I hope they're, they're lenient on him
and I'm not just so we can get a rematch.

1373
01:19:27,151 --> 01:19:30,540
I mean, I love watching
invite first. Um, and I can,

1374
01:19:31,890 --> 01:19:35,890
I can stretch myself to understand his
reaction. I can stretch myself to under,

1375
01:19:35,930 --> 01:19:40,890
I can't stretch myself to understand the
order guys' reactions on what they did

1376
01:19:41,140 --> 01:19:43,640
for him. He jumped over the
cage and he jumps on. It's,

1377
01:19:43,780 --> 01:19:44,920
it's not the end of the horse.

1378
01:19:44,940 --> 01:19:48,960
The guy that jumped in there was
wearing red who punched on her? Yeah.

1379
01:19:49,060 --> 01:19:52,710
I'm not sure. I think that's a spokesman
coach, but I'm guessing he's a fighter.

1380
01:19:52,711 --> 01:19:57,230
He fights with the UFC, uh, in
the red. He was an older man.

1381
01:19:57,300 --> 01:20:01,350
He actually worked with them. Oh, okay.
You work with, there you go. Who is he?

1382
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:05,660
I don't know his name.
Either. Islam or fun.

1383
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:11,070
Yeah, it was either his Llama.
Yeah. I don't think it was
either. One of those guys,

1384
01:20:11,071 --> 01:20:15,540
like I know he is laughing guy. He was,
you know, he hit the guy in the suit.

1385
01:20:15,541 --> 01:20:19,160
That heritage is Russian manager.
He hit Dylan. Either way. Um,

1386
01:20:19,700 --> 01:20:22,230
there's actually indicates
when your mind is going in and,

1387
01:20:22,250 --> 01:20:26,100
and hit him from behind that. Yeah. You
know, I kinda, I kinda understand that.

1388
01:20:26,340 --> 01:20:29,670
Like I said, for, for, for Habib, I
didn't think it was, you know, it was,

1389
01:20:30,570 --> 01:20:34,470
it's just such a foolish thing to do
because we're listening to date already.

1390
01:20:34,510 --> 01:20:38,100
One, I know that Dylan was
talking shit and he was angry,

1391
01:20:38,101 --> 01:20:41,370
but she didn't say anything because
I heard a few people signed up.

1392
01:20:41,371 --> 01:20:44,760
Now I was standing beside Dylan. I
didn't see what he did, but I could hear.

1393
01:20:44,790 --> 01:20:46,710
So he didn't say anything
now and I watched it back.

1394
01:20:46,711 --> 01:20:49,050
I seen he kind of beckoned
them on. Yeah. You know,

1395
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:52,530
just stupid end the fight stuff.
But it,

1396
01:20:52,860 --> 01:20:54,570
I didn't think it justified
that level of response.

1397
01:20:54,571 --> 01:20:56,460
And maybe there was something
else in the lead up. You know,

1398
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:58,740
probably dealing is a
bit of a troll online.

1399
01:20:58,990 --> 01:21:03,510
So there's probably a bit of a
build up of voter stuff. But um,

1400
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:07,680
yeah, like I said it, it wasn't that big
a deal to me. What I'd be dead. Yeah.

1401
01:21:07,690 --> 01:21:10,950
It just really wasn't. Well,
there's two ways of looking at it.

1402
01:21:11,190 --> 01:21:15,850
Well, in terms of like the trash
talking and one way is that man,

1403
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:19,360
does that sell a fight? I mean
it sells a fight. Me Connors,

1404
01:21:19,420 --> 01:21:23,200
one of the best ever at, if not the best
ever at it, talking shit to opponents,

1405
01:21:23,470 --> 01:21:26,850
getting them riled up and me,
it is the reason why Josie,

1406
01:21:26,851 --> 01:21:30,100
although lost his composure and
came charging faith first at Conner.

1407
01:21:30,430 --> 01:21:33,580
I mean you got to think emotions
play a big part of that.

1408
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:37,060
It ramps up your stress.
It ramps up the fighters,

1409
01:21:37,061 --> 01:21:41,560
a anxiety anticipation and the ramps up,
the pressure on them to win and to,

1410
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:45,400
and this emotion that they're
fighting with fucks up their judgment.

1411
01:21:45,550 --> 01:21:50,350
It just does. And it's a major tool
that tonally, that Connor uses. And,

1412
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:53,830
but on the other hand people say,

1413
01:21:53,831 --> 01:21:56,950
well I'd like when fighters are respectful
and this is one of the things that

1414
01:21:56,951 --> 01:22:00,580
could be saying this, this, this,
uh, supports should be about respect.

1415
01:22:00,820 --> 01:22:03,430
You shouldn't be talking about someone's
family shouldn't be talking about

1416
01:22:03,431 --> 01:22:05,980
someone's religion. You shouldn't
be talking about someone's country.

1417
01:22:06,670 --> 01:22:09,310
But you know,
on the other hand,

1418
01:22:10,330 --> 01:22:14,350
that's one of the reasons why Conor is so
fucking huge. It's not just as results,

1419
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:17,830
it's all the other things that come
along with it is the excitement that he

1420
01:22:17,831 --> 01:22:22,090
generates a shit talking though. Who the
fuck is that guy? Like that kind of shit.

1421
01:22:22,091 --> 01:22:26,650
That's a big part of who he is. It's a
part of who he is as this cultural icon.

1422
01:22:26,980 --> 01:22:29,200
I mean it's one of the
reasons why people love them.

1423
01:22:29,230 --> 01:22:33,730
I mean they don't just love
his ability inside the octagon,

1424
01:22:33,731 --> 01:22:36,340
which is quite substantial
that they love the swagger.

1425
01:22:36,490 --> 01:22:40,180
They love when he comes in with rubber
arms and, and struts around the cage.

1426
01:22:40,210 --> 01:22:43,090
They love all that shit.
They love all that shit.

1427
01:22:43,091 --> 01:22:45,460
But it's like when is too far?

1428
01:22:45,540 --> 01:22:49,770
And that is the question. When is
too far. Yeah. Um, yeah. You know,

1429
01:22:50,390 --> 01:22:52,530
Connor is a real ad divider.
You know,

1430
01:22:52,590 --> 01:22:54,420
some people will love it and
some people will hate it.

1431
01:22:54,780 --> 01:22:57,450
I'm not really that interested
in people's opinions on things.

1432
01:22:57,451 --> 01:23:02,430
I'm just interested in what is
and what is that sells fights.

1433
01:23:02,620 --> 01:23:07,510
Yeah. There's a reason he's the highest
paid guy. Um, so if that is what is,

1434
01:23:07,511 --> 01:23:11,380
and that's just natural for him to do as
well. It's not an act. It's not, you know,

1435
01:23:11,530 --> 01:23:12,400
when he's sparring,

1436
01:23:12,430 --> 01:23:15,910
like I am an art and were best of
friends and every single sparity Shitoki

1437
01:23:15,910 --> 01:23:17,260
Jeweler, oh, you're the
shit today. You know,

1438
01:23:17,261 --> 01:23:19,240
you know what I'm formed today
and they're gonna. You know,

1439
01:23:19,241 --> 01:23:22,570
people listen to them like they hate each
other and then speak smiles at the end

1440
01:23:22,571 --> 01:23:25,750
of it. It's just part of the game
for him. It's partly, he enjoys it.

1441
01:23:26,170 --> 01:23:30,430
It's a bit of fun. This one was
darker, you know, as, as, as Dana said,

1442
01:23:30,431 --> 01:23:32,950
it definitely was,
but it's just part of who he is.

1443
01:23:32,951 --> 01:23:34,570
I don't really involve myself in it.

1444
01:23:34,870 --> 01:23:39,830
I tried to stay outside of that and then
just focus on the, the task in hand.

1445
01:23:40,410 --> 01:23:44,200
Ever get cringey for you because
you are a very respectful guy. Yeah.

1446
01:23:44,201 --> 01:23:47,590
I mean it's absolutely not my personality.
It's absolutely not my personality.

1447
01:23:47,770 --> 01:23:50,980
But again, I don't find my own
opinions on things. Very interesting.

1448
01:23:51,310 --> 01:23:54,850
I'm only interested in,
um, what is, you know,

1449
01:23:55,390 --> 01:24:00,130
there's the fact that he does this
and it's got an the results he has.

1450
01:24:00,430 --> 01:24:05,260
Okay. Well I guess that's what he
does. It's not how I am. Right. I mean,

1451
01:24:05,261 --> 01:24:08,200
you look at the two biggest
names in combat sports,

1452
01:24:08,230 --> 01:24:11,680
Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor and
they both do it. Yeah. I mean, you know,

1453
01:24:11,681 --> 01:24:15,150
like my favorite fighter back
in the day was fate or, and it,

1454
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:19,430
there was a non that barely said anything
and the is if you want to say love

1455
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:23,560
them. But he was also fighting
mostly in Japan. It's different vibe.

1456
01:24:23,590 --> 01:24:27,310
It's a different culture than here.
Um, you know, you could beat that guy.

1457
01:24:27,311 --> 01:24:29,230
And I almost have the two extremes.

1458
01:24:29,231 --> 01:24:33,250
I've got to Nelson who you never hear
a blip out of. And then I have Connor,

1459
01:24:33,251 --> 01:24:36,940
who's, you know, the other end
of the scale. And, um, you know,

1460
01:24:36,941 --> 01:24:40,840
you can only be true to yourself, but
at, I look at their, their, you know,

1461
01:24:40,841 --> 01:24:43,720
their followings and their sponsorship
deals and their fight purses and stuff.

1462
01:24:43,721 --> 01:24:47,790
And it's obvious which one is doing
better. You know, if, if the, if the,

1463
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:51,640
if we can agree on the object, the prize
fighting is to make money and that's it.

1464
01:24:52,030 --> 01:24:53,950
The object of martial arts
I think is very different,

1465
01:24:53,951 --> 01:24:56,830
but the object of prize fighting
and don't ever lose sight of that.

1466
01:24:57,160 --> 01:24:59,170
As soon as I hear a fighter
saying is for some other reason,

1467
01:24:59,410 --> 01:25:02,020
I'll try to make them retire as quick
as possible because not being smart,

1468
01:25:02,440 --> 01:25:06,910
you know, you're, you're taking
damage for money and keep,

1469
01:25:06,911 --> 01:25:09,370
keep that in mind no matter
what your choices are.

1470
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:14,680
Do you have guys in the gym that you see
that sort of mimic Connor? Oh, of course.

1471
01:25:14,681 --> 01:25:19,390
Of course. You're talking, you're, you're
dealing with teenagers and, and, and 20s.

1472
01:25:19,790 --> 01:25:22,960
And that's, you know, I look back on
myself. It's a hugely impressionable,

1473
01:25:23,170 --> 01:25:26,080
impressionable period of your life.
You're always, you're looking, you know,

1474
01:25:26,081 --> 01:25:30,640
we young men almost try out
different personalities,

1475
01:25:30,641 --> 01:25:35,470
you know, and he was such a strong
personality in the gym. Definitely I can,

1476
01:25:35,740 --> 01:25:38,890
I can spot the 18 year old walking in
with a man bone and the Sioux telling me

1477
01:25:38,891 --> 01:25:43,330
he's going to be the next year. I probably
wouldn't be the same idea. You know,

1478
01:25:43,331 --> 01:25:46,600
it's, it's not different.
But I true again,

1479
01:25:46,601 --> 01:25:49,720
months and years of conversations,
you know, not telling them what to do,

1480
01:25:49,721 --> 01:25:52,870
but conversations, I sort of say this
is a completely natural thing to do,

1481
01:25:52,871 --> 01:25:56,550
but start to find your own voice and find
your own way and if that's who you are,

1482
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:59,950
you enjoy that side but run with it.
If it's not who you were.

1483
01:26:00,610 --> 01:26:03,080
Even the fans will see true
very quick as well. You know,

1484
01:26:03,081 --> 01:26:06,270
the fans can see when someone is
genuinely doing something and uh,

1485
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:08,510
and doing it as, as, as an act. Now,

1486
01:26:08,511 --> 01:26:13,480
who did you guys bring in for wrestling
for this camp? Um, you know, surgery, his,

1487
01:26:13,490 --> 01:26:18,110
his wrestling coach since day one. Um,
yeah, we, we, we're not big into like,

1488
01:26:18,470 --> 01:26:22,670
Oh, if we bring this guy in under six
weeks ago, we're going to learn, you know,

1489
01:26:23,190 --> 01:26:27,950
it's not the approach that the approach
to learn for a camp, but like say now,

1490
01:26:28,270 --> 01:26:32,000
like say if you, you got like
w here we are, it's October.

1491
01:26:32,180 --> 01:26:37,180
If they say we're looking at July of
2019 substantial amount of time from now,

1492
01:26:38,780 --> 01:26:42,890
plenty of time to train and all sorts of
gigantic card the 4th of July weekend.

1493
01:26:42,930 --> 01:26:46,010
Right. Well let's, uh, let's,
let's target a rematch for them.

1494
01:26:46,340 --> 01:26:48,650
What would you do differently?
Well, who'd you bring in,

1495
01:26:48,651 --> 01:26:51,770
in terms of like wrestling? Um,
so when you're, when you're,

1496
01:26:51,771 --> 01:26:53,810
when you're dealing with
somebody for this long,

1497
01:26:53,811 --> 01:26:55,700
you also know there's personalities.
You know,

1498
01:26:55,701 --> 01:26:59,360
and it's one of the reasons why
George worked so well. He's,

1499
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:03,290
he kind of fit it into the,
how the team's structured.

1500
01:27:03,620 --> 01:27:05,480
So you might bring in someone who's,

1501
01:27:05,710 --> 01:27:09,370
and I get so many great offers
from guys with, you know,

1502
01:27:09,770 --> 01:27:10,970
really good credentials,

1503
01:27:11,330 --> 01:27:14,780
but what is the use of that if him
and Connor going to clash, right?

1504
01:27:15,110 --> 01:27:18,080
No matter which athletes I'm dealing with.
So actually to me,

1505
01:27:18,081 --> 01:27:20,670
even almost more important
than anything is, is,

1506
01:27:20,830 --> 01:27:24,710
is that they can connect
and that they have a, um, a,

1507
01:27:24,720 --> 01:27:29,390
a good working relationship. Now, let
me, let me state very clearly as well.

1508
01:27:29,570 --> 01:27:33,470
Surgery is a fantastic wrestling coach.
He's, it comes from agenda, you know,

1509
01:27:33,471 --> 01:27:35,840
generations arresting and Moldova.
He's got the real slick,

1510
01:27:35,841 --> 01:27:37,190
kind of Russian style of wrestling.
You know,

1511
01:27:37,191 --> 01:27:40,460
it's not just about kind of power
doubles. He's very, very slick.

1512
01:27:40,461 --> 01:27:42,680
And we have some very, very slick
wrestlers in the, in the gym.

1513
01:27:43,130 --> 01:27:47,750
So I think we're good there.
And both guys coming in the past and true.

1514
01:27:47,751 --> 01:27:52,190
And we had Helen, Helen morale is
there to female Olympic gold medal, is,

1515
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:55,340
thinks she was the first American
female to get a gold medal.

1516
01:27:55,610 --> 01:27:59,480
She did a lesson Macondo and it was
worked out brilliant. So things are,

1517
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:03,200
they think that would happen naturally
like that. I have a busy Jim.

1518
01:28:03,201 --> 01:28:07,070
I'm always getting photos coming true.
We're always stealing techniques.

1519
01:28:07,071 --> 01:28:08,870
When I tell my guys to
be technique vampires,

1520
01:28:09,320 --> 01:28:11,730
get what you can out of everybody
that comes true. You know,

1521
01:28:11,750 --> 01:28:13,190
you're never going to have a mindset of,

1522
01:28:13,191 --> 01:28:15,080
I don't need to learn from that
guy that like, I don't know,

1523
01:28:15,081 --> 01:28:19,670
something that you don't know. Right.
Um, so that, but for a structured,

1524
01:28:20,300 --> 01:28:22,320
okay, let's train with this guy
for three months I'm are gone.

1525
01:28:23,070 --> 01:28:24,920
That's not really have skilled is,

1526
01:28:24,950 --> 01:28:28,160
is passed on us as far as I can
tell from my experience of it.

1527
01:28:28,860 --> 01:28:33,860
It's got to work personality
wise and I like a I what,

1528
01:28:34,950 --> 01:28:35,240
what,

1529
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:38,660
is there some secret technique that I
remember watching that an interview with

1530
01:28:38,661 --> 01:28:41,960
Dan Henderson and he was saying when
he started doing Jujitsu tournaments,

1531
01:28:42,140 --> 01:28:45,590
he found it so strange that he wouldn't
warm up or each other or that they were

1532
01:28:45,591 --> 01:28:49,250
afraid to see his deep half guard move.
Because in wrestling is,

1533
01:28:49,580 --> 01:28:50,271
I know what you're gonna do.

1534
01:28:50,271 --> 01:28:53,150
You know what I'm gonna do is it's going
to come down to who can hit it on the

1535
01:28:53,150 --> 01:28:54,080
day and he would actually warm up.

1536
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:57,520
But with guys who was going to be
competing with and sometimes even cause it

1537
01:28:57,521 --> 01:28:59,530
made the match a little bit better,
they had a bit of a vibe going.

1538
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,720
And I don't think there's like big
secret move that Connor could learn that

1539
01:29:03,721 --> 01:29:06,990
would suddenly reverse on Habib.
I thought we did quite well.

1540
01:29:07,570 --> 01:29:10,270
He almost took him down at the third,
you know, we were ready for that,

1541
01:29:10,340 --> 01:29:11,820
that low single and he,

1542
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:15,720
we had a little technique for there and
he actually sat him down for a moment.

1543
01:29:16,410 --> 01:29:17,280
He didn't drive in.

1544
01:29:17,281 --> 01:29:20,280
We should've ducked you on the hook there
and went into Jujitsu modes and start

1545
01:29:20,281 --> 01:29:23,130
passing. But instead he would drew
and could be, did a great job.

1546
01:29:23,131 --> 01:29:25,440
He followed them back,
open the angel and then it got to finish.

1547
01:29:25,890 --> 01:29:29,400
So I don't think it's necessarily about,
um,

1548
01:29:29,550 --> 01:29:32,910
trying to bring in a four time gold
medalist or whatever and make a big

1549
01:29:32,911 --> 01:29:35,670
wrestling program that doesn't
quite fit in what we do, you know.

1550
01:29:36,150 --> 01:29:41,150
Do you think though that it would help
him to bring in high level wrestlers to

1551
01:29:41,161 --> 01:29:44,910
have like intense sparring sessions
within so he could feel that kind of

1552
01:29:44,911 --> 01:29:46,380
pressure that could be put on them?

1553
01:29:46,620 --> 01:29:49,740
Because the level of grappling
attack I brings to the octagon,

1554
01:29:49,741 --> 01:29:53,820
it's very difficult to match. Yeah. Yeah.
It's, it's kind of like on the reverse.

1555
01:29:53,821 --> 01:29:57,230
Who would you bring in to bring the level
of striking that Connor can bring in?

1556
01:29:57,231 --> 01:30:00,450
You know, it's right. We as trainers,
we're always looking for that, uh, that,

1557
01:30:00,451 --> 01:30:03,990
that carbon copy so we can get
as close as we can. And we did,

1558
01:30:03,991 --> 01:30:06,050
we had some big one 80,
you know,

1559
01:30:06,140 --> 01:30:10,230
when 80 Fiverr's rushing guys who you
were actually begging them not to put

1560
01:30:10,231 --> 01:30:14,430
anything online because they
can't go home. But, um, so
we, we had guys that were,

1561
01:30:14,490 --> 01:30:15,900
you know,
we're mimicking,

1562
01:30:15,901 --> 01:30:18,500
but there's a reason why he'd
be buzz is on the feeling that,

1563
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:21,690
and the world champion. It's, you
can't get another guy like him.

1564
01:30:22,010 --> 01:30:25,440
You Mimic as much as possible and
you do drills and you do scenarios.

1565
01:30:25,441 --> 01:30:27,780
And you know, Dylan Donald's
was a great training partners,

1566
01:30:27,790 --> 01:30:30,950
has over 200 pounds and he actually
comes to wrestling before Jujitsu's got

1567
01:30:30,951 --> 01:30:31,771
ready to go take downs.

1568
01:30:31,771 --> 01:30:35,190
And he's got a real good eye for
stylistically trying to match somebody.

1569
01:30:35,191 --> 01:30:38,400
So you get as close as you can kind
of ever be the exact guy, you know,

1570
01:30:38,940 --> 01:30:42,930
so you feel like there's enough room for
improvement that if you could go back

1571
01:30:42,931 --> 01:30:45,210
to the drawing board and
give yourself a few months,

1572
01:30:45,480 --> 01:30:49,470
that you could get him to a point
where we can have more success the day.

1573
01:30:49,471 --> 01:30:51,220
I don't think that will,
I would quit, you know?

1574
01:30:51,630 --> 01:30:56,310
So I'm completely biased and I absolutely
think that if we could get another

1575
01:30:56,311 --> 01:30:59,940
shot at it, and we kinda thinks
that as well. Absolutely. What did,

1576
01:30:59,941 --> 01:31:04,440
what did Conor think after the fight
was over? Like what did he say? Um,

1577
01:31:05,370 --> 01:31:09,810
crystal up now it's very down.
He said, you know, watching by,

1578
01:31:09,811 --> 01:31:13,710
he hates, he hates Ms. Yates
technical mistake. So that
right hand, you know, that,

1579
01:31:13,711 --> 01:31:16,860
that he was very disappointed.
He got caught with a shot like that.

1580
01:31:17,190 --> 01:31:19,980
But it's actually funny, I
was just thinking about this,
you know, that right hand,

1581
01:31:19,981 --> 01:31:22,320
if you showed it to a boxing coach,
he said, that's horrible. You know,

1582
01:31:22,321 --> 01:31:24,420
your head's down,
you're swimming again.

1583
01:31:24,421 --> 01:31:26,520
I don't really care about people's
opinions and things I care about.

1584
01:31:26,521 --> 01:31:29,310
It's effectiveness that was down
in effective techniques. You know,

1585
01:31:29,311 --> 01:31:33,410
it's one of the hardest clean shots comes
being caught with in his MMA career.

1586
01:31:33,430 --> 01:31:37,110
Nevermind. And put a boxing guy, you know,
you bring in a box and coach for Habib.

1587
01:31:37,350 --> 01:31:40,500
He would train that out of them. No, your
hands here, it goes straight comes back.

1588
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:42,990
So you've got to be careful about
the individual arts. You know,

1589
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:47,530
you wouldn't know it. High Level Olympic
boxing coach wouldn't teach a Beta,

1590
01:31:47,850 --> 01:31:50,080
but it's very effective. Dan
Henderson's career. It was,

1591
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:51,480
it was around that technique.

1592
01:31:52,250 --> 01:31:55,470
Things changed though when you add in
takedowns right? I mean it's one of the,

1593
01:31:55,700 --> 01:31:58,260
doesn't have to worry or did
that, you know, it's a great,

1594
01:31:58,530 --> 01:32:02,560
it's a part of being a such a high level
graph or you can go in and swing crazy,

1595
01:32:02,561 --> 01:32:05,910
you know, kind of has to go in and be
always worried about the guy coming on.

1596
01:32:05,911 --> 01:32:10,580
Anita is underneath the shots.
So yeah, things change styles.

1597
01:32:10,630 --> 01:32:13,210
It's what makes the sport so interesting.
Yeah.

1598
01:32:13,350 --> 01:32:16,960
We made the comparison between Kevin
Randleman when he fought Mirko Cro cop.

1599
01:32:17,150 --> 01:32:21,130
That cro cop was so worried
about the takedown random
and comes to the big punch,

1600
01:32:21,160 --> 01:32:24,850
knocks him out.
There was a similar set of circumstances,

1601
01:32:25,170 --> 01:32:28,720
kind of recovered very, very quickly.
But yeah, he's had a hell of a chin.

1602
01:32:29,080 --> 01:32:31,330
Yes he does. Yeah. He's, he's rarely,

1603
01:32:31,370 --> 01:32:35,590
he's rarely hit and that's of course
kept his chin strong because it does

1604
01:32:35,591 --> 01:32:36,424
diminish, you know, he's,

1605
01:32:36,820 --> 01:32:41,230
he's 15 years spiring almost daily,
you know.

1606
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:44,740
So if he didn't have that style of,
of being elusive,

1607
01:32:45,010 --> 01:32:46,870
if he was a war Jim War guy,

1608
01:32:47,320 --> 01:32:51,880
he wouldn't be able to do what he's able
to do something hard. Does he spar? Um,

1609
01:32:51,940 --> 01:32:54,430
it will. It's a little bit dependent
on, on, on who were against.

1610
01:32:54,431 --> 01:32:58,170
If I brought in a sparring partner,
it's like a fight. You know, it,

1611
01:32:58,171 --> 01:33:01,150
it's going to be like a fight
he's looking to finish. Um,

1612
01:33:01,151 --> 01:33:05,630
if it's a training partner, teammates,
we're probably doing it at a,

1613
01:33:05,730 --> 01:33:08,440
at a lower level.
And if you bring in someone,

1614
01:33:08,530 --> 01:33:10,870
there's no fucking way they're ready.
They've got to be right.

1615
01:33:10,871 --> 01:33:14,260
And I tell them real, I will say
it to them. I say two things.

1616
01:33:14,261 --> 01:33:18,610
One he's going to talk to you, don't
take it personal. This is how he lives.

1617
01:33:18,920 --> 01:33:21,760
And two, it's going to be a fight.
So protect yourself, be ready.

1618
01:33:22,180 --> 01:33:26,620
Now I referee and I'll be quick to
step in. But we have to do this.

1619
01:33:26,621 --> 01:33:30,040
We have to get a level of training
that's going to match the intensity of a

1620
01:33:30,041 --> 01:33:34,000
contest. Um, ego and did it all
the time. No, you know, that's,

1621
01:33:34,270 --> 01:33:36,680
that's only in at a certain period of,

1622
01:33:36,730 --> 01:33:41,570
of of the training camp and it's only
going to be for us, it's once every four,

1623
01:33:41,571 --> 01:33:44,320
once every eight days is kind of depending
on how to spar went and had a buddy

1624
01:33:44,321 --> 01:33:47,920
is the more of that we can do it the
better because it's more directly

1625
01:33:48,610 --> 01:33:51,910
correlates to what we're actually
going to do. But then it,

1626
01:33:51,950 --> 01:33:55,450
then you've got to be matched against,
well, if he was the GM war type guy,

1627
01:33:55,451 --> 01:33:57,940
I'd have to pull back aspiring because
he's taking too many shots. Right?

1628
01:33:58,080 --> 01:34:01,510
Could cocoa training camp propane hit?
You know, he's just, he's so elusive,

1629
01:34:01,910 --> 01:34:06,070
indicates so good at judging
range and, and so on. So for him,

1630
01:34:06,071 --> 01:34:08,170
he can spare all the
time. You know, it's like,

1631
01:34:09,160 --> 01:34:11,140
I think another example that
may be Darren till he's,

1632
01:34:11,350 --> 01:34:12,430
he's the top dog in the gym,

1633
01:34:12,431 --> 01:34:15,220
so he can spare all day long because
he's never re excepts in damage.

1634
01:34:15,530 --> 01:34:16,720
But if you're number 10 in the gym,

1635
01:34:16,810 --> 01:34:18,850
you probably shouldn't swear
all the time because you're,

1636
01:34:18,990 --> 01:34:22,990
you're taking the shot for him
particularly, he loves fighting.

1637
01:34:23,020 --> 01:34:25,540
He loves barring after his
favorite part of the training.

1638
01:34:25,541 --> 01:34:29,330
You do that seven days a week
of let them, um, you know,

1639
01:34:29,331 --> 01:34:30,640
we trains together or areas,

1640
01:34:30,641 --> 01:34:33,730
but there's always the glint in the
eye and it's what's today sparing. Oh,

1641
01:34:34,300 --> 01:34:36,880
here we go.
How can you decide to do it?

1642
01:34:36,940 --> 01:34:41,710
Do you have a set schedule or
do you yeah. Yeah. So, um, we,

1643
01:34:41,730 --> 01:34:46,480
we, we, we do things in cycles
and it will vary up for him,

1644
01:34:46,481 --> 01:34:50,920
but it's roughly on an eight, an eight
day cycle that I do with him. And, uh,

1645
01:34:51,370 --> 01:34:54,190
they want and for we'll be,
we'll be sparing again,

1646
01:34:54,191 --> 01:34:58,340
a little bit dependent on where the way
it is and how the last went and how he's

1647
01:34:58,341 --> 01:35:02,240
feeling. But if I can get that out
and that's, that's what I did for now.

1648
01:35:02,241 --> 01:35:05,990
When you train for the Mayweather
fight, what, first of all,

1649
01:35:06,020 --> 01:35:09,050
how much time did you have to prepare
for that? For 10 weeks to the day?

1650
01:35:09,530 --> 01:35:13,560
That doesn't seem like a lot. No,
no. I remember just getting the,

1651
01:35:13,610 --> 01:35:18,260
getting the message. Do you think that
that was a calculated on Floyd's part? Uh,

1652
01:35:18,290 --> 01:35:21,350
maybe he's a very smart guy because it
seems like most of his fights or planned

1653
01:35:21,351 --> 01:35:22,460
way in advance,

1654
01:35:22,470 --> 01:35:26,680
but that one was like what a couple of
months away just sort of happened. Yeah.

1655
01:35:26,730 --> 01:35:29,700
Yeah, it was, was it August? Is that
when the fight took place? It was August.

1656
01:35:30,410 --> 01:35:34,010
And so I remember hearing about it and
thinking of like, wait, wait, August.

1657
01:35:34,490 --> 01:35:37,910
That's fucking really close.
Right? Like for a Mayweather fight,

1658
01:35:37,911 --> 01:35:41,810
you would think six weeks or six
months or something along those lines.

1659
01:35:41,811 --> 01:35:46,811
But I would feel like for Floyd is as
great as he is and probably the best ever

1660
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:50,930
in terms of boxing technique
and not being hit. I mean,

1661
01:35:50,931 --> 01:35:55,730
he's so elusive still really wouldn't
want a guy like Conor preparing for a long

1662
01:35:55,731 --> 01:36:00,210
period of time. It really getting
acclimated. Yeah. Yeah. Um,

1663
01:36:00,640 --> 01:36:03,740
it was kind of funny how that all came
about because when he fought Eddie in

1664
01:36:03,741 --> 01:36:08,580
November, the year before, I remember
shortly after that we were at a function.

1665
01:36:08,580 --> 01:36:12,050
Then I kind of pulled him aside and
I shook his hand and said, right,

1666
01:36:12,080 --> 01:36:15,170
you're doing all the best,
enjoy the rest of your life.

1667
01:36:15,560 --> 01:36:18,070
And he was kind of shocked it was
saying this to him, but I said,

1668
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:20,780
what else are you going to do?
You're at a two way champion. You've,

1669
01:36:21,110 --> 01:36:24,340
you've got out the other
end of this grind, this,

1670
01:36:24,341 --> 01:36:26,380
this meat grinder with no damage.
You,

1671
01:36:26,810 --> 01:36:29,870
you're in a very small percentage and
you've, you've made plenty of money,

1672
01:36:30,230 --> 01:36:32,710
often enjoy yourself.
And um,

1673
01:36:32,780 --> 01:36:35,390
and then telling my past couple of
months had passed and then this,

1674
01:36:35,391 --> 01:36:38,660
the Mayweather fight,
start talking. And I could,

1675
01:36:38,810 --> 01:36:43,070
I could understand that because now his
grandkids were going to be financially

1676
01:36:43,071 --> 01:36:46,580
secure. So it made sense
because it was a big pay day.

1677
01:36:46,610 --> 01:36:49,370
It didn't really make sense for,
and you got a reason he enjoyed it.

1678
01:36:49,700 --> 01:36:52,190
The competition side of it,
that's the matter what you're doing.

1679
01:36:52,190 --> 01:36:55,260
Mechanic is going to be competition. I
don't care what it is. He's going to look,

1680
01:36:55,970 --> 01:36:58,370
how quick did you do that? You're
like, oh, it's been for pis. Yeah,

1681
01:36:58,371 --> 01:37:00,950
I'll do a quicker. Yeah.
He's just that way,

1682
01:37:00,951 --> 01:37:03,200
so it didn't start having a bit of a
back and forth. He's like, yeah, okay,

1683
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:06,940
let's put the boxing and be the best
boxer in the world. And for me, my second,

1684
01:37:06,950 --> 01:37:09,820
you know, I was on the outside go,
okay, I understand what you know,

1685
01:37:09,940 --> 01:37:13,070
does that makes sense to do and nothing
else was really making sense at the time.

1686
01:37:13,640 --> 01:37:14,930
It's going to be damaging.

1687
01:37:14,931 --> 01:37:19,670
Boxing is a horrendous for to prepare
for and to compete in because we're just

1688
01:37:19,730 --> 01:37:22,250
looking at one thing, really punches
to the head, you know? I don't know.

1689
01:37:22,251 --> 01:37:25,760
Of course the buddy's house as well,
but, but it, it's, it's so damaging.

1690
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,910
The only justification I can
see for that was, you know,

1691
01:37:28,911 --> 01:37:31,880
your grandkids are financially
set. Yeah. Tremendous.

1692
01:37:31,881 --> 01:37:36,380
Tremendous hype behind a tremendous amount
of money. Did you think he could win?

1693
01:37:37,890 --> 01:37:40,940
I of course I'm, I'm, I'm always gone
to think that way. You know that,

1694
01:37:40,941 --> 01:37:44,600
that's my mindset. Let's prepare
as best we can. That's the,

1695
01:37:44,601 --> 01:37:48,710
it's their options here. Um, when he
landed that uppercut and the first round,

1696
01:37:49,700 --> 01:37:54,020
what did you think? Yeah. Like even
when he went down to do that. So,

1697
01:37:54,021 --> 01:37:57,450
you know we did a whole training camp
and we brought in, you probably heard,

1698
01:37:57,480 --> 01:37:59,350
we probably haven't thought
about that to my knowledge.

1699
01:37:59,720 --> 01:38:02,240
And that was my first time
ever seen him against the uh,

1700
01:38:02,241 --> 01:38:07,080
recognize boxer cause in the gym we
have a local guys in those sparring

1701
01:38:07,081 --> 01:38:08,520
sessions.
Cause what we got to see,

1702
01:38:08,760 --> 01:38:12,180
the clip that was released was
Connor lighting moule analogy up.

1703
01:38:12,840 --> 01:38:17,840
But Paulie Malignaggi insists that most
of the sparring was him dominating.

1704
01:38:18,900 --> 01:38:23,510
Now that's not what I saw. Um, you know
when we, when he came back from it,

1705
01:38:23,511 --> 01:38:28,110
like he did it a spar, he
went away, it all broke. Cause
know a picture got leaked.

1706
01:38:28,111 --> 01:38:29,670
And then he probably did
a little of interviews.

1707
01:38:29,671 --> 01:38:33,990
He was on the east coast work in the
show. So when he came back, he came back,

1708
01:38:34,020 --> 01:38:36,030
it was coming back to have
a fight and it was actually,

1709
01:38:36,031 --> 01:38:39,650
it was a weird night in the gym because,
uh, the, the Fertitta brothers come in,

1710
01:38:39,680 --> 01:38:43,280
Dana commander was a few celebrities come
in. It was a fight, you know, and, and,

1711
01:38:43,281 --> 01:38:45,090
and the,
the referee was there.

1712
01:38:45,091 --> 01:38:49,890
Joe Cretae is a great guy and he
did 12 hard rounds. And I do it,

1713
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:54,420
I think there is something being released
on Netflix soon at documentary based

1714
01:38:54,421 --> 01:38:58,020
around our fight and it will have all the,
have all the rounds. So I guess really,

1715
01:38:58,410 --> 01:39:01,560
yeah, I mean we have, of course we have
the rounds, we have to 12 rounds and a,

1716
01:39:01,561 --> 01:39:05,220
it's, as far as I'm aware, I just actually
did an interview for a recently there.

1717
01:39:05,221 --> 01:39:08,660
I think it's a tree park
documentary that's going to
be on Netflix soon. And uh,

1718
01:39:08,661 --> 01:39:10,590
so people will get to make
up their own minds about it.

1719
01:39:10,591 --> 01:39:14,340
But just going back to the fight. So what
did you think though about the sparring

1720
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:18,600
when he walked out? When they walked
out first and I went to myself,

1721
01:39:18,970 --> 01:39:20,160
I have no idea what's going to happen.

1722
01:39:20,310 --> 01:39:23,990
I seen unboxing amateurs back
home and some pros, I, I'm,

1723
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,880
I'm horrendously ignorant
of the boxing world. I just,

1724
01:39:26,881 --> 01:39:30,090
I just don't really follow it. And he
was schooling those guys and I was like,

1725
01:39:30,600 --> 01:39:33,660
yeah, but they're in a world
champion at that elite level.

1726
01:39:34,020 --> 01:39:37,440
So that night when he went into the
ring of Paul, I was like, you know,

1727
01:39:37,460 --> 01:39:39,840
me and Owen are kind of like,
what's going to happen here? Is He,

1728
01:39:40,200 --> 01:39:43,530
is he just going to get tooled? And then
we have to scratch our heads and go,

1729
01:39:44,070 --> 01:39:45,600
shit, well we're, we going to do here.

1730
01:39:46,500 --> 01:39:49,650
But he came back after the rounds and me
and him are going, wait, wait a second.

1731
01:39:49,750 --> 01:39:54,090
It's not magic. It's still punching in
its range and there's techniques. And

1732
01:39:55,650 --> 01:40:00,480
so I got, my confidence was
growing, my confidence was
growing, so I knew I, I knew,

1733
01:40:00,481 --> 01:40:03,810
no matter what happened, it was going to
be a good fight. It wasn't going to be,

1734
01:40:04,260 --> 01:40:07,470
you know, you could win and
just this looks terrible.

1735
01:40:07,471 --> 01:40:11,190
He's is missing whatever you shard and
he's being made look silly. Who Was it?

1736
01:40:11,250 --> 01:40:13,140
A good fight, you know, it's entertaining.

1737
01:40:13,140 --> 01:40:15,690
I think no one in the crowd
was saying that was ridiculous.

1738
01:40:15,691 --> 01:40:18,300
No one was saying that was
a waste of money. It was,

1739
01:40:18,301 --> 01:40:21,690
it was an entertaining fight and it's
going to be one of those things that I'll

1740
01:40:21,691 --> 01:40:24,710
be an older man than I am now and
I'll be talking about at the time we,

1741
01:40:25,020 --> 01:40:27,270
we went into the boxing
world and fall flight,

1742
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:29,550
even though the night I was kind
of just looking at it, scratch me,

1743
01:40:29,551 --> 01:40:34,510
what am I doing here that's valued,
may it and his dad over there.

1744
01:40:34,810 --> 01:40:35,820
These are guys that,
you know,

1745
01:40:35,970 --> 01:40:39,300
of all the boxes I always preferred
watch in Floyd and anyone else because I

1746
01:40:39,301 --> 01:40:40,134
love defense.

1747
01:40:40,380 --> 01:40:44,790
Defense to me is the most intriguing
part and him and Tony and uh, those,

1748
01:40:44,791 --> 01:40:49,530
those type of guys and how we work the
Philly shell. And it was, it's beautiful.

1749
01:40:49,531 --> 01:40:52,940
It's so interesting to watch
and you getting on a bit, um,

1750
01:40:53,230 --> 01:40:56,270
but still able to compete so fantastic.
Is this whole career,

1751
01:40:56,271 --> 01:41:00,270
it was defensive base. Never took the
shots. Never, never was damaged into gym.

1752
01:41:00,280 --> 01:41:02,410
There was damage in fights,
but yeah,

1753
01:41:02,411 --> 01:41:06,010
when he was in the ring and divert
working in the corner in air corner,

1754
01:41:06,011 --> 01:41:08,550
I'm just going, what the hell is
Connor doing? Fighting Flight?

1755
01:41:09,720 --> 01:41:12,110
This is just strange. Even even
at the beginning, you know,

1756
01:41:12,111 --> 01:41:15,160
and so he used to Bruce buffer and it
was a different guy and he hit the bell

1757
01:41:15,161 --> 01:41:17,500
three times. I was like, Oh, you
had to do that in the rocky movies.

1758
01:41:17,501 --> 01:41:19,960
I remember that thing. Dane,
Dane, ladies and gentleman,

1759
01:41:20,020 --> 01:41:23,290
it's kind of the beginning of the
ceremonial and I was like, Oh shit,

1760
01:41:23,291 --> 01:41:25,980
that they're actually going to
parks, you know? Right, right,

1761
01:41:25,981 --> 01:41:27,010
right until the end of it.

1762
01:41:27,011 --> 01:41:31,030
It was still just head scratching and
then fly coming over at the end and given

1763
01:41:31,090 --> 01:41:32,140
him a little compliment.
You know,

1764
01:41:32,141 --> 01:41:34,820
he's got a hell of a shawl and he's
tough as nails and it was just,

1765
01:41:34,830 --> 01:41:37,480
it was a great experience. Oh, I
wouldn't do anything different.

1766
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:41,170
It's the polymeal Nrg sparring session,
which she said was like a fight.

1767
01:41:41,200 --> 01:41:45,780
If it was scored as a fight, you think
Connor would have won the fight? Um, yeah,

1768
01:41:45,820 --> 01:41:48,220
of course. I'm going to say yes
and then we'll say, well no.

1769
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,570
Everybody was there in the night,
had asked Dane eat.

1770
01:41:51,880 --> 01:41:55,990
Actually Dana knows a lot
more about boxing the media
than I do and all of those

1771
01:41:55,991 --> 01:41:59,140
guys were going, okay, we have a fight
on our hands here. This is going to be,

1772
01:41:59,500 --> 01:42:03,110
this is going to be an interesting
contest. So Rhea I buy,

1773
01:42:03,111 --> 01:42:04,540
I'm of course going to say,
yeah,

1774
01:42:04,541 --> 01:42:06,700
well I guess people will see it
around and make up their own mind.

1775
01:42:06,730 --> 01:42:08,120
But it wasn't as one sided.

1776
01:42:08,120 --> 01:42:11,380
It's those clips that were
released were forced Polly,

1777
01:42:11,560 --> 01:42:12,670
he landed his shots as well.

1778
01:42:12,671 --> 01:42:17,080
Of course he's a brilliant boxer
was for me as a trainer was,

1779
01:42:17,590 --> 01:42:18,910
it was amazing. Look at him,
you know, he's, he's like,

1780
01:42:18,930 --> 01:42:22,600
he's put on a little bit of weight and
you still have to go 12 rounds because

1781
01:42:22,780 --> 01:42:25,720
after about round four was gone and he's
not going to continue her cause it's

1782
01:42:25,721 --> 01:42:28,840
breeding very heavy and he'd been
hit hard and he'd been sat down once.

1783
01:42:28,841 --> 01:42:30,510
And whether that was a push or opponent,
you,

1784
01:42:30,850 --> 01:42:33,190
you guys can make up your own mind
at that, but a lot of heavy shots.

1785
01:42:33,210 --> 01:42:35,170
I'm thinking he's going
to be out here by six.

1786
01:42:35,470 --> 01:42:38,650
So we had another sparring partner.
I'm ready. And I was like, okay,

1787
01:42:38,651 --> 01:42:41,880
just be ready to go cause I think this
will go by six rounds. And then Paul,

1788
01:42:41,881 --> 01:42:44,830
he just hit this rhythm and start learning
his own shots and it turned out to be

1789
01:42:44,831 --> 01:42:46,600
a great, a great content. You know,

1790
01:42:46,910 --> 01:42:49,630
it's a contest because it wasn't a
spiral they were talking to all time.

1791
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:52,900
Paul was talking to me, he was talking
to the camera man. He talked to him.

1792
01:42:53,110 --> 01:42:55,840
He was almost better than Conrad.
It was great to watch.

1793
01:42:56,110 --> 01:42:57,280
Everybody had a great night.

1794
01:42:57,281 --> 01:43:00,970
And I think the bill actually bizarrely
enjoy it at the lake kind of con or an

1795
01:43:00,971 --> 01:43:05,340
aid. It's Batman and the joker, like,
you know, they both need each other each.

1796
01:43:06,210 --> 01:43:08,890
It's a weird dynamic when you,
when you see a contest like that.

1797
01:43:08,920 --> 01:43:12,820
Well he was campaigning for a fight.
Yeah. He's trying to get Connor to,

1798
01:43:13,330 --> 01:43:14,560
to box him.
Yeah.

1799
01:43:16,060 --> 01:43:18,700
It's not out of the realms
of possibilities real.

1800
01:43:18,701 --> 01:43:21,170
It's absolutely an outer realms
of possibilities. There's,

1801
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:23,510
there's all sorts of crazy
rumors going around the,

1802
01:43:23,530 --> 01:43:26,860
the managing team and the fight
team and what might happen next.

1803
01:43:26,861 --> 01:43:30,880
It could be boxing group, it could be
him, it could be Floyd, Floyd. Again,

1804
01:43:31,510 --> 01:43:33,820
all sorts of names are
being thrown around. Well,

1805
01:43:33,850 --> 01:43:36,910
one thing that happened in the fight there
was undeniable is that Connor started

1806
01:43:36,911 --> 01:43:41,290
to fade and we've talked about this,
the endurance issue. Like what,

1807
01:43:41,320 --> 01:43:44,830
what do you think is that
issue? Well, it certainly in,

1808
01:43:44,860 --> 01:43:49,860
in that fight you could see and what I
learned about it was just brilliant to

1809
01:43:51,801 --> 01:43:54,050
watch Floyd how he managed his energy.

1810
01:43:54,051 --> 01:43:57,410
I think it's one punch in round one
and maybe not much more around too.

1811
01:43:57,830 --> 01:44:02,240
It was just so, you know, it's
such an amazing strategy. And then,

1812
01:44:02,450 --> 01:44:06,020
and then switching from the usual style
to kind of does hands up and walk in and,

1813
01:44:06,410 --> 01:44:11,030
and Connor did on load a lot on his forms.
Very inefficient,

1814
01:44:11,031 --> 01:44:14,260
which is the opposite of what I would
describe Connors fighting style.

1815
01:44:14,261 --> 01:44:17,480
These efficient, very few
shots, maximum return.

1816
01:44:17,870 --> 01:44:21,680
This was a lots of pointers and it was
one of the few bits of advice I gave them

1817
01:44:21,681 --> 01:44:25,400
in the corner that was of any use because
I'm not a boxing guy was let's pick

1818
01:44:25,401 --> 01:44:27,200
our show that there's a reason
why he's not telling anything.

1819
01:44:27,620 --> 01:44:29,480
You don't try anything.
This is 12 rounds.

1820
01:44:29,870 --> 01:44:33,770
It's almost like this tree parts to a
fight as one to forward his five to uh,

1821
01:44:33,850 --> 01:44:38,150
Asian. Then there's nine to 12 and fly
just worked that beautifully and it'd be

1822
01:44:38,151 --> 01:44:41,950
something that we would definitely do a
lot more if we were to ever get an order

1823
01:44:41,960 --> 01:44:46,360
boxing fight. It was recognized that
as 12 rounds pace yourself. He was,

1824
01:44:46,370 --> 01:44:49,670
he was kind of in the MNA mode of
just big shots and late the guy up,

1825
01:44:49,671 --> 01:44:52,760
but Floyd's the best in
the world not being lit up.

1826
01:44:52,940 --> 01:44:56,840
Do you think it's a pacing issue and not
an endurance issue? I think it's both.

1827
01:44:57,770 --> 01:45:01,860
Um, but specifically for the
boxing. Yeah, it was, it was,

1828
01:45:01,940 --> 01:45:06,080
there was pacing and
endurance in a new field.

1829
01:45:06,380 --> 01:45:10,010
No clench work at all. We had a few
little kind of funny clinch techniques.

1830
01:45:10,011 --> 01:45:14,190
We were going to try and hammer fist
to the back of the head. There was a,

1831
01:45:14,210 --> 01:45:15,740
well he was aiming for the decided ahead.

1832
01:45:15,800 --> 01:45:17,150
It was supposed to be
like at the Aina Week.

1833
01:45:17,450 --> 01:45:19,750
We played around with little
stretches of the rule.

1834
01:45:19,751 --> 01:45:23,580
Then we'd see what joker Taser pulls up
on and could we do little, you know I,

1835
01:45:23,590 --> 01:45:26,360
I'm a a chunk are fine as well and you
need comes from wrestling and you see him

1836
01:45:26,361 --> 01:45:29,200
doing kind of what almost looked
like arm drags and, and, and,

1837
01:45:29,201 --> 01:45:30,260
and tie ups and stuff.

1838
01:45:30,261 --> 01:45:33,060
So we were trying to use that and
we've just got broke every time we'd,

1839
01:45:33,290 --> 01:45:35,530
we had very little opportunity to kind of,
you know,

1840
01:45:35,540 --> 01:45:37,790
even going towards the back and holding
the hip and hit me with one hand.

1841
01:45:37,910 --> 01:45:41,300
I couldn't find anything in the written
rules that there were against that.

1842
01:45:41,301 --> 01:45:44,660
But we were pulled on the straight away.
So some of the areas where we taught,

1843
01:45:44,661 --> 01:45:49,040
we had to rest and, and maybe make Floyd
use energy that he's on use to clinch.

1844
01:45:49,460 --> 01:45:52,670
We didn't get that. It was, it was
a media breaks and that's, you know,

1845
01:45:52,671 --> 01:45:56,390
that's the sport of boxing, but
that's the Saturdays. So he had,

1846
01:45:56,391 --> 01:45:59,030
it would have to be all those,
all those types of adjustments.

1847
01:45:59,630 --> 01:46:04,520
One of the more fascinating rumors was
that there was going to be some sort of a

1848
01:46:04,521 --> 01:46:09,290
striking match in the octagon
that is with MMA gloves.

1849
01:46:09,291 --> 01:46:12,520
It's being talked about it, it was being
talked about is being talking about.

1850
01:46:13,130 --> 01:46:16,820
That's been going around as
well, Dan about that and he
said it was horseshit. Oh,

1851
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:21,590
okay. Well I don't deal with, you had
heard about this. I had heard of it.

1852
01:46:21,650 --> 01:46:23,810
Who's talking to you about it?
You know,

1853
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:26,740
speaking with Connor and springs
Manga to talk about like the,

1854
01:46:26,741 --> 01:46:31,250
you can only throw leg kicks but
taxing. That would be the end. Yeah.

1855
01:46:31,310 --> 01:46:33,690
I mean especially Lloyd, the, the site,

1856
01:46:35,060 --> 01:46:36,920
the site and Stan says,
you know what,

1857
01:46:36,921 --> 01:46:40,190
it's like if you get a leg kick and that
way you must face straight on so you

1858
01:46:40,191 --> 01:46:44,600
can check layer cakes. If they
allowed leg kicks and only leg kicks,

1859
01:46:44,660 --> 01:46:49,040
no head kicks. Connor would fuck
him up hundred percent quickly.

1860
01:46:49,260 --> 01:46:51,270
100% it would be the first cake.

1861
01:46:51,390 --> 01:46:54,030
No one even understands it'd
be the first leg kick. Yeah.

1862
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:57,870
Now I will say right away that Connor,
absolutely it doesn't want to do that.

1863
01:46:57,960 --> 01:47:01,020
He wants to fight UFC
rules or boxing rules.

1864
01:47:01,130 --> 01:47:06,130
Oh zero interest in the high
reflects just that alone.

1865
01:47:06,540 --> 01:47:09,050
A hybrid fight. Just
leg kicks alone. Yeah,

1866
01:47:09,630 --> 01:47:13,500
he would fuck Floyd Mayweather up. Doesn't
even want to fuck Floyd Mayweather up.

1867
01:47:14,340 --> 01:47:17,670
He does but, but within one of
the two wheel sets it doesn't,

1868
01:47:17,671 --> 01:47:22,230
he just thinks it's just let
them throw like just a few.

1869
01:47:22,360 --> 01:47:26,310
I mean it doesn't matter what fucking
stands Floyd stands in either inside leg

1870
01:47:26,311 --> 01:47:29,870
cakes, outside leg kicks. Just one
of those. It would be like we've,

1871
01:47:29,880 --> 01:47:34,880
we've allowed to Ireland is we have very
good boxing history and I'm very good

1872
01:47:34,921 --> 01:47:39,650
athletes and we get the odd time and a
good boxer will come down for spar and

1873
01:47:39,690 --> 01:47:40,140
you know,

1874
01:47:40,140 --> 01:47:44,610
these guys can take shots all day long
and wound leg kick and Dave wrong.

1875
01:47:44,640 --> 01:47:48,630
You know, it's such a pain
that they've never felt before.
You know, like you said,

1876
01:47:48,631 --> 01:47:51,090
it just, it changes
everything very, very quickly.

1877
01:47:51,120 --> 01:47:54,000
It would change Floyd's entire game.
He has no idea.

1878
01:47:54,420 --> 01:47:59,030
Do you remember what cool Vince
Phillips fought Masato in Japan? No.

1879
01:47:59,250 --> 01:48:02,580
When Vince Phillips is at the top
of his game, when he was, you know,

1880
01:48:02,581 --> 01:48:04,110
a real elite boxer,

1881
01:48:04,111 --> 01:48:08,910
it was just starting to slide and he
went over and fought Masato and k one and

1882
01:48:08,911 --> 01:48:11,880
Masato just for tis legs up.

1883
01:48:12,250 --> 01:48:16,470
Sure as fuck those legs up.
It was horrifying to watch.

1884
01:48:17,040 --> 01:48:21,720
The only one that I remember that
went over there, and actually,

1885
01:48:21,780 --> 01:48:26,070
oh, Shannon cannon, Channon and
Cannon Shannon Briggs fought,

1886
01:48:26,160 --> 01:48:27,030
uh,

1887
01:48:27,330 --> 01:48:31,020
Tom Erickson and Tom Erickson cracked him
with a couple of leg kicks and Shannon

1888
01:48:31,021 --> 01:48:33,900
actually talked about it on
the podcast. He's like, champ.

1889
01:48:33,930 --> 01:48:36,750
He kept me with a couple of those
leg kicks. I was ready to quit champ.

1890
01:48:37,070 --> 01:48:40,550
He was like, it hurts so bad. She
goes, but I'm pretending. He goes,

1891
01:48:40,551 --> 01:48:43,410
I'm pretending today ain't nothing.
He goes, I'm in agony chair.

1892
01:48:43,860 --> 01:48:46,320
It's just a different pain.
It's a stomachs.

1893
01:48:46,620 --> 01:48:49,800
You can get whacked in the head all
day long and most fighters won't even

1894
01:48:49,801 --> 01:48:53,420
recognize that, but the right body
shot, you know he hit that liver or,

1895
01:48:53,421 --> 01:48:56,490
or the right leg kick and
there's just no grit and true.

1896
01:48:56,640 --> 01:48:59,370
It's stunning for people that
have never been kicked before.

1897
01:48:59,371 --> 01:49:01,940
It's stunning to watch
WWE. They're like, what?

1898
01:49:01,960 --> 01:49:06,750
This happens all the time and if
you watch like a k one match or a,

1899
01:49:06,770 --> 01:49:10,110
you know,
a glory match or Moy Tai,

1900
01:49:10,320 --> 01:49:13,860
it's just crazy how often they get kicked
and they just learn how to absorb it.

1901
01:49:13,861 --> 01:49:18,360
They learn how to check it and
eat it and it just takes time.

1902
01:49:20,070 --> 01:49:20,880
But that would,

1903
01:49:20,880 --> 01:49:25,880
that would be if you could somehow or
another talk Conor and Floyd into a boxing

1904
01:49:26,461 --> 01:49:29,310
match with leg kicks.
Did Floyd actually say that?

1905
01:49:29,311 --> 01:49:31,500
That would be something to consider.
It was just one of those,

1906
01:49:31,960 --> 01:49:35,040
while I'm talking to Connor,
you'd regularly throw stuff at me.

1907
01:49:35,041 --> 01:49:37,200
Then I'm just like, what the hell
are you talking? I mean there's,

1908
01:49:37,270 --> 01:49:40,200
I'm always having weird conversation and
this was just one of them where it come

1909
01:49:40,201 --> 01:49:42,750
up that there's a possibility. It
is. And they were talking about it,

1910
01:49:42,810 --> 01:49:46,230
hybrid rules and he shut it down
straight away. You'll find them.

1911
01:49:46,350 --> 01:49:49,420
You'll find them, obviously eat and
when they, it would be of course, ideal.

1912
01:49:50,110 --> 01:49:53,860
I think Floyd is a very intelligent guy.
He's not that good,

1913
01:49:54,340 --> 01:49:56,080
absolute intelligent guy.
He's not going to do that.

1914
01:49:56,380 --> 01:49:59,350
I don't even think you would do the
leg kick. I don't think so wider.

1915
01:49:59,380 --> 01:50:01,640
I think he flirts with a lot
of this stuff and I'll, yeah,

1916
01:50:01,870 --> 01:50:06,040
I'll come over to your world, but he's,
no, he's no fool. He's a super smart guy.

1917
01:50:06,060 --> 01:50:10,200
I just can't imagine that he would spar
with one guy and eat one of those kicks

1918
01:50:10,201 --> 01:50:13,810
and he was just like, oh,
fuck this. Fuck all that.

1919
01:50:14,290 --> 01:50:16,560
It changes the way you're
allowed to stand. Yes.

1920
01:50:16,630 --> 01:50:18,820
I mean he would have to be
very light on his front leg.

1921
01:50:18,821 --> 01:50:21,550
You'd have to learn how
to condition his shins.

1922
01:50:21,610 --> 01:50:24,220
I mean it's like the whole
thing would be different,

1923
01:50:25,030 --> 01:50:29,620
but they have talked about some sort
of a rematch inbox. It's like I said,

1924
01:50:29,621 --> 01:50:33,190
it's just one of those things that's
thrown out there and hear a bit of a movie

1925
01:50:33,191 --> 01:50:35,440
role and you hear this and this
and that and the, you know,

1926
01:50:35,690 --> 01:50:39,970
Connor has the world at his feet are so
many people want to pull them in so many

1927
01:50:39,971 --> 01:50:40,804
different ways,

1928
01:50:41,020 --> 01:50:46,020
but he seems to have avoided some of
the more obvious Hollywood type traps,

1929
01:50:46,460 --> 01:50:49,480
you know, because like Rhonda Rousey
got sucked into all of them, right?

1930
01:50:49,480 --> 01:50:50,620
She was doing everything.

1931
01:50:50,621 --> 01:50:54,880
She was all these TV shows and movies
and I remember before she lost a Holly

1932
01:50:54,880 --> 01:50:58,000
Holm thinking, God, she's getting
stretched thin. Like this can't be good.

1933
01:50:58,030 --> 01:51:01,330
This can't be good. You know, and
I was worried about Amanda Nunez.

1934
01:51:01,331 --> 01:51:04,810
Amanda Nunez was the one that I
thought had, Ron does number. I'm like,

1935
01:51:04,811 --> 01:51:06,670
that girl punches so fucking hard.

1936
01:51:06,880 --> 01:51:10,990
And she's an elite ground specialist
and like it wouldn't be a picnic on the

1937
01:51:10,991 --> 01:51:14,770
ground. And Rhonda, you know, takes
girls to the ground and submits them.

1938
01:51:14,950 --> 01:51:17,710
But it was like, but you got to get
through the fire. That's Amanda Nunez,

1939
01:51:17,711 --> 01:51:18,544
his hands.

1940
01:51:18,630 --> 01:51:22,450
And I remember seeing her and all these
other things and these television shows

1941
01:51:22,451 --> 01:51:26,200
and these movie deals and I was like,
those things will rob you.

1942
01:51:26,620 --> 01:51:28,690
They rob you, you, they give you,

1943
01:51:28,780 --> 01:51:31,750
they give you something to give you
some money to give you some fame.

1944
01:51:31,750 --> 01:51:35,920
You walk that red carpet, you look
wonderful. Smile Ronda, look over here,

1945
01:51:35,980 --> 01:51:40,030
smile Connor.
But they steal things from you.

1946
01:51:40,150 --> 01:51:43,870
They steal your ability to actually fight.
They steal your ability to,

1947
01:51:43,880 --> 01:51:45,580
to have all of your resources.

1948
01:51:45,581 --> 01:51:49,330
And Connor's done an amazing
job of avoiding that for
the most part. I mean he's,

1949
01:51:49,450 --> 01:51:53,230
you know, it was proper 12 whiskey coming
out and that photo shoots, you know,

1950
01:51:53,231 --> 01:51:57,130
had to be done. And um,
but no movies, the movies,

1951
01:51:57,131 --> 01:52:00,870
the movies are the ones that really
fucking rob you. Yeah. Yeah. You actually,

1952
01:52:00,871 --> 01:52:03,910
you had a small part in the movie when
he was, when he was just starting off 18,

1953
01:52:03,911 --> 01:52:07,310
19 is the large movie,
20 things a little head and

1954
01:52:10,690 --> 01:52:15,490
he played a prisoner. Um, but yeah, uh,

1955
01:52:15,620 --> 01:52:18,880
yeah, he's, because he's obsessed
with finding, he loves fighting.

1956
01:52:19,840 --> 01:52:22,360
He was beautiful.
You could see in the lead up to this,

1957
01:52:22,361 --> 01:52:24,510
he didn't want to do and
much, much, you know,

1958
01:52:24,620 --> 01:52:27,610
media and press and the camps
in agreement we'll be doing.

1959
01:52:27,640 --> 01:52:30,690
He'd rather do none of it
and have no buildup. If you,

1960
01:52:30,790 --> 01:52:34,120
Conner is ideal world I think
would be the fight in every UFC.

1961
01:52:34,121 --> 01:52:35,830
Every Saturday night.
That'll be as ideal.

1962
01:52:35,831 --> 01:52:40,510
Just live near the UFC and fight Saturday
night and then have a fun night Sunday

1963
01:52:40,511 --> 01:52:42,190
and then get ready for the next site.

1964
01:52:42,520 --> 01:52:45,410
We loved fighting like what
else did you do? And like I,

1965
01:52:45,510 --> 01:52:46,730
I scratch my head about this.

1966
01:52:46,930 --> 01:52:49,880
If I had done my eye [inaudible] gauge
or it could be even though, thank you.

1967
01:52:51,110 --> 01:52:53,090
I'm good.
He wants to get right back in.

1968
01:52:53,140 --> 01:52:57,940
He wants or fight Floyd and
definitely the heavy one is, that's,

1969
01:52:57,970 --> 01:53:02,660
that's the, that's the fire. If you had to
guess what's next, what would you think?

1970
01:53:03,440 --> 01:53:05,340
Um, you know, I,

1971
01:53:05,390 --> 01:53:08,800
I won't pretend to understand the business
side of things in Adi empowered on

1972
01:53:08,801 --> 01:53:10,810
date.
They do all a dad and you know,

1973
01:53:10,820 --> 01:53:15,540
the fans so much and the officials
decide and who gets the next shot. I,

1974
01:53:15,541 --> 01:53:18,320
I'm a, I only deal with what, you know,
what's going to be put in front of me.

1975
01:53:19,280 --> 01:53:22,490
I think it will be the, it'd be rematched
rematch. I think it will be that.

1976
01:53:23,210 --> 01:53:27,380
Now I'll be getting torn apart and
it isn't there. This and this guys,

1977
01:53:27,590 --> 01:53:32,310
I'm only saying what I think is it going
to be someone else will be, you know,

1978
01:53:32,780 --> 01:53:35,430
I don't really know, but that's
what I see him talking about me.

1979
01:53:35,431 --> 01:53:36,560
So that's how my mind is.

1980
01:53:37,040 --> 01:53:40,250
What do you think will be different in
terms of the way he approaches it in

1981
01:53:40,251 --> 01:53:42,680
terms of like trash talking
and all that other stuff.

1982
01:53:43,430 --> 01:53:46,970
He's never gonna to not be him. That's,
that's the side of his personality,

1983
01:53:46,971 --> 01:53:51,210
you know? And you know, it's a, it's
a dividing line in my, you know,

1984
01:53:51,260 --> 01:53:54,590
my parents are not mad about it and it,
but the kids are my gym lover, you know?

1985
01:53:54,590 --> 01:53:56,810
It's just what it does.
It's just one of those things.

1986
01:53:57,080 --> 01:54:01,730
Corners never knock on to do that.
That's, that's like in Dublin, Eh,

1987
01:54:01,731 --> 01:54:03,470
you know, we're, we're where he's from.

1988
01:54:03,650 --> 01:54:06,640
There's always that guy in the class
that was just sharp wit, you know,

1989
01:54:07,040 --> 01:54:09,020
had the quick reply.
And from the moment I met him,

1990
01:54:09,021 --> 01:54:12,460
he was just that guy that's just like,
you can't make a tiny mistake around you,

1991
01:54:12,470 --> 01:54:16,580
make you feel stupid very quick, you know?
Uh, yeah, I've been on the end of it.

1992
01:54:17,560 --> 01:54:19,140
Um,
but I remember going to it,

1993
01:54:19,200 --> 01:54:21,500
I remember that guy in school as well
and it just happens that he has it,

1994
01:54:21,820 --> 01:54:25,660
you know, Leetal left hand on top of
that and then he has the look and he,

1995
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:30,440
he just an unusual package that it,
that it all came together. So I don't,

1996
01:54:30,930 --> 01:54:33,470
you know, they build up
pretty astute. He didn't stop.

1997
01:54:33,800 --> 01:54:36,750
It wasn't like he was going to go, oh, I
hope I don't lose this time. And you know,

1998
01:54:36,800 --> 01:54:40,460
he went through the same kind of mindset
he had and I've known that he would go

1999
01:54:40,461 --> 01:54:45,020
into that fight that's fully prepared
as we can and he'd be 100% sure in his

2000
01:54:45,021 --> 01:54:48,290
mind he's going to destroy me around
because that's how we always think.

2001
01:54:48,530 --> 01:54:51,170
If there's another fight that
would sell and it would be huge.

2002
01:54:51,200 --> 01:54:55,220
It would be that it would be d
as three or, yeah, that could be.

2003
01:54:55,221 --> 01:54:59,840
Especially if Diaz gets passport. Yeah,
yeah. Is he any shit? Even if he doesn't,

2004
01:55:00,400 --> 01:55:04,850
I mean just that fight alone.
I mean there's the history
between those two guys.

2005
01:55:05,090 --> 01:55:09,170
I mean, that would be, and
it's, it's so appealing
stylistically as well. The fight,

2006
01:55:09,171 --> 01:55:12,740
you know, I, I'm a, I'm a
grappler heart, I love grappling,

2007
01:55:12,830 --> 01:55:15,650
but I also understand that you do to
turn them a little, put people to sleep.

2008
01:55:15,650 --> 01:55:18,920
You know, even if you're into
Jujitsu, it's hard to watch
you to do, to tournament.

2009
01:55:20,090 --> 01:55:23,750
Anybody can see a punch hitting someone
in the head and then falling down.

2010
01:55:23,751 --> 01:55:25,490
That's, you know, that's exciting.

2011
01:55:25,760 --> 01:55:28,910
And Him and Diaz is such a
great personality match up.

2012
01:55:28,911 --> 01:55:32,300
It's such a great skill clash.
You know,

2013
01:55:32,301 --> 01:55:35,170
if I was the design somebody that's
going to bring the best ever corner,

2014
01:55:35,180 --> 01:55:36,500
you'd want someone that,
you know,

2015
01:55:36,501 --> 01:55:39,910
can hit back and take a big shot
and put up at the trash. It's a,

2016
01:55:39,920 --> 01:55:44,160
it's a beautiful fight. I, I, I always,
I would love to see that rematch. Yeah.

2017
01:55:44,161 --> 01:55:48,840
The thing about Dia's when they first
fought was that he didn't give a fuck

2018
01:55:48,930 --> 01:55:53,740
about trash talk. It didn't bother him
at all. It was normal. It was like, oh,

2019
01:55:53,741 --> 01:55:57,870
okay, we're doing this. Yeah. Yeah. It
was brilliant. It was amazing. It was,

2020
01:55:57,900 --> 01:56:00,510
it was what everybody
wanted to see at the time.

2021
01:56:00,660 --> 01:56:03,630
It's because Tom Connor was so good at
talking shit and people would get so

2022
01:56:03,631 --> 01:56:06,450
flustered,
but then Diaz didn't give a fuck.

2023
01:56:06,480 --> 01:56:09,540
And you could tell he didn't give a fuck.
It was just so normal for him.

2024
01:56:09,840 --> 01:56:13,920
And it was like, wow, trash talk doesn't
work on Diaz really doesn't work.

2025
01:56:14,320 --> 01:56:18,300
Like I had known about some of his train
and partners and, and he's like, Connor,

2026
01:56:18,301 --> 01:56:20,930
like in the gym, he's dressed
shogun. Those butter your trash.

2027
01:56:20,940 --> 01:56:25,650
I knew every sparing. It's because
it's fun, you know, it's always just,

2028
01:56:25,710 --> 01:56:28,250
you know, when we have a con
or having a big spar, you know,

2029
01:56:28,251 --> 01:56:29,390
at the gym will be packed down.

2030
01:56:29,580 --> 01:56:32,430
Everybody wants to come down and see in
the spine and just see, you know, he's,

2031
01:56:32,431 --> 01:56:33,790
he's talking to the guy had a hallway.
True.

2032
01:56:33,810 --> 01:56:36,870
Whether it's a close friend like RFM or
whether it's someone we brought in that

2033
01:56:36,871 --> 01:56:40,410
he doesn't know, it's not going
to change them. You know, I'll be,

2034
01:56:40,411 --> 01:56:41,540
I certainly don't inspiring,

2035
01:56:41,550 --> 01:56:44,480
but it will roll room it and even trash
talk me when I'm trying to do my Jesus

2036
01:56:44,590 --> 01:56:49,170
shut up. But it's, you know, it's
just, it's, it's his personality.

2037
01:56:49,650 --> 01:56:54,650
So what timeline or do you think we're
looking at in terms of his return?

2038
01:56:55,830 --> 01:56:58,890
If you had to guess?
It was funny,

2039
01:56:58,891 --> 01:57:03,891
I was looking at a March 16th is Patty's
Day is March 17th that's a Sunday.

2040
01:57:05,070 --> 01:57:09,000
March 16th was a Saturday.
Oh. Imagine like Msg. I'm the,

2041
01:57:09,180 --> 01:57:12,510
the Saturday night before Paddy's
Day. Oh my God. That'd be insane.

2042
01:57:13,200 --> 01:57:15,210
I wonder if it's not booked.
Yeah,

2043
01:57:15,360 --> 01:57:18,000
I was actually going to go on and
she's booked pretty far in advance.

2044
01:57:18,030 --> 01:57:19,820
I had imagined, so I'd invite in. So,

2045
01:57:19,950 --> 01:57:23,100
and they're doing one in November
to do two at MSG and a year.

2046
01:57:23,250 --> 01:57:26,130
I think you could do Connor in there
every weekend and it's going to bed.

2047
01:57:26,280 --> 01:57:29,160
You could also do the Diaz
every weekend and it's gonna be,

2048
01:57:29,370 --> 01:57:33,240
it's gonna be packed out. You could do
the TD garden in Boston too. Yeah, yeah.

2049
01:57:33,241 --> 01:57:35,910
We've had fucking Irish in Boston.

2050
01:57:36,870 --> 01:57:40,380
More Irish in Boston than there.
And you could do of course,

2051
01:57:40,381 --> 01:57:45,060
Vegas and Vegas and gamble, but it
just, I saw that date. But um, you know,

2052
01:57:45,061 --> 01:57:48,570
like you said, there's the big summer
card as well and you have to fight week.

2053
01:57:48,571 --> 01:57:52,890
Did you light July card? Um,
I, I think probably summer,

2054
01:57:52,891 --> 01:57:56,940
next summer is probably realistic. You
know, we have to obviously see what, what,

2055
01:57:56,941 --> 01:58:01,040
what punishment hippy gets hope.
It's not alone.

2056
01:58:02,130 --> 01:58:05,940
I'm not sure. I mean, everybody was so
amped up after the fact that I, you know,

2057
01:58:05,941 --> 01:58:10,920
I was like, Oh man, this could be
terrible. But Monday morning I'm like,

2058
01:58:10,950 --> 01:58:15,570
Eh, the fuck happened. Really?
Nobody died. Nobody even got cut.

2059
01:58:15,810 --> 01:58:18,930
A couple of people got punched in
a place where people get punched.

2060
01:58:19,590 --> 01:58:24,050
You know what I mean? It's like, no, I
have to go to her hat and that I am like,

2061
01:58:24,051 --> 01:58:27,620
I have a big commercial
gym. I coach kids, I, I'm,

2062
01:58:27,640 --> 01:58:30,630
I'm head president of the amateur
MMA association back home.

2063
01:58:30,631 --> 01:58:34,140
I deal with politicians all the time
and this is the exact thing that they're

2064
01:58:34,320 --> 01:58:35,640
arguing with me or you know,
when I'm,

2065
01:58:35,641 --> 01:58:38,790
when I'm wearing a suit on a Wednesday
meeting with the Minister for Sport,

2066
01:58:39,210 --> 01:58:40,650
I'm not,
so I'm looking at the own great.

2067
01:58:40,651 --> 01:58:42,940
That's what's to be brought up at my
next meeting when I'm trying to get

2068
01:58:43,270 --> 01:58:47,760
governing body a status for, for
my, for my life's work, my, my art,

2069
01:58:47,780 --> 01:58:48,613
my sport,

2070
01:58:48,880 --> 01:58:51,970
and I'm trying to tell plus 60 year
olds that this is legitimate and they're

2071
01:58:51,971 --> 01:58:56,860
showing me this and you're, you
know, so for that it was terrible.

2072
01:58:56,980 --> 01:59:00,110
You know, there's no other way around
it. Like I said, if, if it was it,

2073
01:59:00,130 --> 01:59:03,250
if it had be better done that isolated,
I didn't think it was that big a deal.

2074
01:59:03,590 --> 01:59:06,590
They need it, that big a deal. He
didn't really hit Dylan and the,

2075
01:59:06,591 --> 01:59:09,860
a bit of pushing and pulling
nothing. Who Cares? You Man.

2076
01:59:09,880 --> 01:59:13,030
Coming up and hitting it was
absolutely dangerous. You know,

2077
01:59:13,031 --> 01:59:15,760
he's a trained fighter, he bare
knuckles and he's, you know,

2078
01:59:15,910 --> 01:59:18,280
hitting a guy who's tired,
who's done hard rounds,

2079
01:59:18,281 --> 01:59:22,030
who's taken some headshots and he, you
know, we went for the illegal shot.

2080
01:59:22,031 --> 01:59:26,000
You know, there's a reason why you're not
let it to the stem at a brain there. Um,

2081
01:59:27,250 --> 01:59:30,760
there has to be something that,
there has to be ramifications for that.

2082
01:59:30,761 --> 01:59:33,400
It can't be just like God or hitting
each other and you cannot allow that to

2083
01:59:33,401 --> 01:59:35,380
happen again. No, no. And, and I,

2084
01:59:35,510 --> 01:59:40,030
an example has to be made so that order
flow people in, in the height of it go,

2085
01:59:40,031 --> 01:59:42,340
wait a second.
It's not just a slap on the wrist.

2086
01:59:42,341 --> 01:59:46,260
Something substantial happens if you
do something criminal and you know,

2087
01:59:46,270 --> 01:59:48,310
it's the salt. Yeah, it literally is.

2088
01:59:48,311 --> 01:59:52,990
And I really worry about him in terms
of him having a visa and being able to

2089
01:59:52,991 --> 01:59:55,160
obtain a visa and fight in America again.

2090
01:59:55,161 --> 01:59:58,030
And I believe he was supposed
to be fighting next month.

2091
01:59:58,240 --> 02:00:03,220
Do we find out who that guy
was? He did. Right. Well, I
know what it starts with. A,

2092
02:00:03,221 --> 02:00:07,000
Z. One of them was the guy that, uh, Artem
was going to fight in three weeks time.

2093
02:00:10,180 --> 02:00:13,690
Okay. Let me read it.
Yeah, that's the guy.

2094
02:00:14,590 --> 02:00:18,010
That's the guy. He was actually
bragging about it on a social media.

2095
02:00:18,690 --> 02:00:20,920
How do you say Zhou Zhou?

2096
02:00:20,921 --> 02:00:25,921
Barea talk who go to the other constantly
and Islam market share face UFC acts

2097
02:00:28,761 --> 02:00:31,330
as Conor McGregor ringing.
Attackers reveal. Yeah.

2098
02:00:31,840 --> 02:00:33,940
Zuberi I don't know how to say his name.
I'm sorry.

2099
02:00:34,150 --> 02:00:38,560
I think he's the one that was wearing red
that jumped the cage and a and punched

2100
02:00:38,561 --> 02:00:42,100
Connor bare knuckle Islam market. Gee,
he's the one that hopped over the right.

2101
02:00:42,101 --> 02:00:45,880
Did, that happened right in front of me.
Yeah. I think that was him in the red.

2102
02:00:45,881 --> 02:00:49,510
I thought that was in the black that
Haman and Connor had a little exchange and

2103
02:00:49,511 --> 02:00:51,190
then they get the other
guy hit him from behind.

2104
02:00:51,191 --> 02:00:53,110
But I thought that was
going to be market changer.

2105
02:00:53,111 --> 02:00:57,040
We're getting him texting to
correct us. Not sure. Yeah.

2106
02:00:57,610 --> 02:01:01,850
Uh, either way. Either. That can't happen
again. That stuff, you know, I hope,

2107
02:01:02,590 --> 02:01:06,550
I hope it all gets worked out. Um,
well, thank you gentlemen. Thanks.

2108
02:01:06,551 --> 02:01:10,720
Thanks for being here at George. Thank
you for illuminating the very elusive art

2109
02:01:11,070 --> 02:01:15,000
cutting and it's, uh, it was an excellent
conversation. You're all dipped out now,

2110
02:01:15,001 --> 02:01:15,834
huh?

2111
02:01:17,100 --> 02:01:21,400
Cognitive ability by
about 200% does it dip?

2112
02:01:21,450 --> 02:01:25,590
Increases your cognitive ability, but
200% wireless truck drivers. So stupid.

2113
02:01:26,750 --> 02:01:31,640
You know, truck drivers listening right
now. Fuck you joke folks. Just to show,

2114
02:01:31,800 --> 02:01:36,180
that's what I do about my people. Let's
say 80% of the stats are made up on the,

2115
02:01:36,360 --> 02:01:41,090
on the spot. That's what I'm all about
making shit. And thank you John. Really,

2116
02:01:41,091 --> 02:01:44,330
really appreciate you coming
in here really was a lot
of fun and hopefully we'll

2117
02:01:44,331 --> 02:01:48,830
do it again under a brighter times.
It's just sport. It is. Of course,

2118
02:01:48,840 --> 02:01:52,460
just for, I really appreciate that.
Thank you. Thank you everybody.

2119
02:02:05,080 --> 02:02:05,150
Yeah.
