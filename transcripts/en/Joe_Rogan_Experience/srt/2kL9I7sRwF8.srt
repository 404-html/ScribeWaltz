1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:00,400
Okay,

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:08,820
the Joe Rogan experience Joe Rogan 
podcast by night.

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:14,040
All Day.
Read up on.

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,880
That's the first month I ever had.
I might've gotten it from you.

5
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:22,280
Maybe.
Maybe we're off.

6
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:24,260
We're recording.
Yeah.

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,360
Cool.
That's exciting.

8
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:27,590
It's that simple.

9
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,050
We're on a hike.
Ladies and gentlemen.

10
00:00:31,051 --> 00:00:33,930
We're a hike.
You were wearing 45 pounds on you?

11
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,370
Yeah.
The packs about five or six.

12
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,100
And the weight plates?
About 45.

13
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:42,250
Yeah.

14
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:45,590
Close to your face.
Oh,

15
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:46,520
sorry.
That's okay.

16
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,170
By the way,
this is how much.

17
00:00:48,171 --> 00:00:51,060
This is what I walked around with.
This is what I walked around with it.

18
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,040
And in Southeast Asia.
Oh yeah.

19
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:54,560
About this.
This setup?

20
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,220
Yeah.
Well,

21
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:57,260
yeah,
I mean the way it hooks onto your waist.

22
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,680
Yeah.
And then the over the shoulder and over 

23
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:02,680
the middle to over your chest.
Oh,

24
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,450
for a backpack?
Yeah.

25
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:04,730
Yeah.
And about the same amount of weight.

26
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,920
Forty five pounds plus whatever else 
have hanging on.

27
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:08,690
Damn.
That was.

28
00:01:08,691 --> 00:01:10,550
So you just carried your life on your 
back.

29
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:11,390
Carried everything.
I have.

30
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,490
Did you bring a laptop?
Fuck No,

31
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:19,030
you're kidding me.
It's a couple people did because they 

32
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:19,700
were like how to upload pictures that 
the two weekers did that.

33
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:24,970
Right.
But almost anyone who's gone for like 

34
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:25,820
more than a month was like,
you could just go to an Internet cafe,

35
00:01:25,821 --> 00:01:26,110
right?

36
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:26,840
Yeah.
If you have to.

37
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,810
Yeah.
And you would just log into your Gmail.

38
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:31,880
Yeah,
exactly.

39
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:36,970
And then did you,
you had to deal with that notification 

40
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:36,970
thing,
right?

41
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:36,970
Yeah,
a couple of times.

42
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:38,780
Even though I started that smell,
just the new gmo,

43
00:01:38,781 --> 00:01:41,000
just for the fucking travel,
they still fucked.

44
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,100
It was still like,
well,

45
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:43,190
this looks suspicious.
And I'm like,

46
00:01:43,191 --> 00:01:44,030
yeah,
it looks suspicious.

47
00:01:44,031 --> 00:01:45,980
Should I'm in fucking nowhere.
I'm in Indonesia.

48
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:47,630
Absolutely.
But then like,

49
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:48,970
can we.
There's no other way.

50
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:49,550
There was no.
Like,

51
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:51,500
what's your father's,
you know,

52
00:01:51,501 --> 00:01:52,970
what's your mom's maiden name?
God.

53
00:01:52,971 --> 00:01:54,200
This gorgeous.
Ready,

54
00:01:54,201 --> 00:01:54,410
right?

55
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:57,840
Yeah.
Yeah.

56
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,000
Did your kids are so fucking big now?
I know.

57
00:02:03,001 --> 00:02:03,600
It's weird,
right?

58
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,050
A little humans.
Yeah.

59
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,670
I couldn't believe it.
When I saw them,

60
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:09,630
I was like,
I was just like,

61
00:02:09,631 --> 00:02:14,631
no way.
Where do you see the oldest grown ass 

62
00:02:14,631 --> 00:02:15,480
woman?
It's very strange,

63
00:02:15,481 --> 00:02:17,100
dude.
And one day we're going to be old men.

64
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,380
Men were kind of old men right now to 
kids.

65
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,750
Yeah.
But one day we're going to be old men.

66
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,610
Yeah.
I'm getting grazer ready.

67
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,920
Nobody rides for free.
Yeah.

68
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,210
What does it ask?
Cash.

69
00:02:28,211 --> 00:02:29,340
Aggress.
Yeah.

70
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,860
Everybody pays.
Yeah.

71
00:02:31,861 --> 00:02:32,940
It's crazy,
isn't it?

72
00:02:32,941 --> 00:02:34,890
I mean just.
And everybody thinks,

73
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:36,690
you know,
it's the sort of the same feeling that I

74
00:02:36,691 --> 00:02:40,350
have when I talked to people about 
asteroid impacts.

75
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,810
Nobody wants to believe it's possible.
What some.

76
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,890
It's smashing into a big rock from the 
sky.

77
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,570
I've been obsessed with it for years.

78
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,960
We saw one you saw in Joshua tree.
Oh Jesus.

79
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,390
To lit up and it burned for like 15 
seconds in the.

80
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,510
Those are so terrible.
It was so cool.

81
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,950
It was red and we're just like,
that's not a.

82
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,830
We were on mushrooms but everyone had 
the same.

83
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,930
Same Book.
That's A.

84
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,620
I mean it's a rock.
Yeah.

85
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:08,170
And it just burned off,
burned off,

86
00:03:08,171 --> 00:03:11,800
burned off until it was just went out.
But it like lasted for awhile.

87
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,160
We were looking for a,
what's it called?

88
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:16,450
You know,
shooting stars and stuff.

89
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,160
Stars out there.
So great.

90
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,380
Oh yeah,
man.

91
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,380
Probably out here too,
Huh?

92
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:23,270
Nah,
we get some light pollution that.

93
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,030
A little light pollution,
but it's not bad.

94
00:03:25,031 --> 00:03:30,031
It's definitely better than the city,
but you really want to go out there like

95
00:03:30,071 --> 00:03:31,960
in Hawaii.
Holy Shit.

96
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,830
What?
The stars.

97
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,060
Amazing.
Really?

98
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:39,120
Yeah.
I was in Lanai last week and the stars 

99
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:39,130
were just stunning,
man.

100
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:43,060
He just laid back and look up at him.
Like you see the Milky Way.

101
00:03:43,061 --> 00:03:44,050
You see everything.
Everything.

102
00:03:44,051 --> 00:03:45,390
You see that that's.
What's that like?

103
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:48,960
The line down the middle sometimes you 
know that's the thick line.

104
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:53,970
Yeah.
That's a thick clouds and it looks 

105
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:53,970
white.
What's this?

106
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:55,150
What's that?
What's this animal dog shit?

107
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:56,950
No,
that's coyote.

108
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,590
The reason why you can tell,
it's because it has berries in it.

109
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,580
A really?
Yeah.

110
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:04,180
Kylie's are kind of omnivores.
They're weird little animals,

111
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:05,620
but they don't attack people,
right?

112
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:06,160
Yeah,
they do.

113
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,180
They do.
Yeah,

114
00:04:07,181 --> 00:04:08,770
they do.
If they have an opportunity,

115
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:12,280
we have some sort of a fucking truth.
Yeah.

116
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:14,550
We'll just.
You alone with the coyote.

117
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,240
Well,
they would go for it.

118
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:19,390
A woman in Canada was killed a couple of
years back,

119
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:23,110
19 year old promising folk singer.
There's more coyote.

120
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:24,610
He could see the hairs in it.

121
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,980
That's it.
Yeah.

122
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,130
That's an animal that's been eating 
things that might be a mountain lion,

123
00:04:30,131 --> 00:04:31,840
but I don't think so.
It might be a bobcat.

124
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:38,130
But um,
I remember that that female Canadian 

125
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:40,471
singer apparently where she was,
the real problem is they have a,

126
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:45,970
they have a real lack of things for them
to eat.

127
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,800
And so the coyote started approaching.
Well,

128
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:51,880
the coyotes there will even take off a 
moose.

129
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:55,810
No.
As a pack or by himself as a pack.

130
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:59,650
They just attack the legs until it can't
go anywhere.

131
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:02,410
You just keep chasing it and biting its 
legs.

132
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:03,560
Really?
Yeah.

133
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:06,040
Some of them get kicked in the head and 
killed while they're doing it.

134
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:11,041
I mean,
they just take chances because there's 

135
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:11,041
no food.
They sell food.

136
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:12,430
So they found this chick walking by 
herself.

137
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,380
Whoops.
And it's a horrible way to die,

138
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:15,580
man,
because they,

139
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:16,750
you asshole first.

140
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,530
So he was still alive as a girl.
She's still alive.

141
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,810
The turner apart.
They don't kill you first.

142
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,070
They have no interest.
I don't care about eating.

143
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:27,370
Go start chewing you apart.
And when they got her,

144
00:05:27,371 --> 00:05:30,010
she was still alive,
torn apart.

145
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:35,280
And then they took her to the hospital.
She died I think where they found her 

146
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:35,280
alive.
Yeah,

147
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:40,480
pretty sure.
She was just fucked up like half her 

148
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,130
face.
You ask first it takes a to eat.

149
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,130
What do you mean?
Ask for.

150
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:47,270
That's what they do to animals.
They kill you by eating you asshole 

151
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:47,750
first.
Yeah.

152
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,060
That's what coyotes.
Do.

153
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:52,080
Wolves do the same thing.
They start at your asshole.

154
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:56,020
Horrible reason for real the most?
Yeah.

155
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:58,760
For Real.
Like they start at your asshole.

156
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:01,880
Yeah.
It's a terrible way to die.

157
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:06,860
So I'm a hiking in these vibram five 
fingers shoes.

158
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,440
The coaches,
they're minimalist shoes.

159
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:14,770
There's like almost no padding.
There's just some tread like heavy 

160
00:06:16,521 --> 00:06:17,480
socks.
Yeah,

161
00:06:17,481 --> 00:06:20,300
there's tread,
but there's very little hurt.

162
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,350
You get those?
Um,

163
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,110
what's the thing on your heel when it 
hurts?

164
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:25,880
No,
no.

165
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:30,140
I mean I'm feel the rocks on the rocks.
It's just toughening up my feet.

166
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:32,120
So it's doing,
it's making my feet stronger.

167
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,430
The way it's been described to me is 
that your foot,

168
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,730
when you're in a regular shoe,
your foot is in a cast.

169
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,130
And that,
uh,

170
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:41,690
just like how if you ever had a broken 
arm,

171
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:46,030
you get that castle farm has atrophied 
or your legs actually.

172
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,580
Yeah,
for sure.

173
00:06:46,581 --> 00:06:50,180
You have the same thing with your foot.
Your foot is walking around in this cast

174
00:06:50,181 --> 00:06:55,181
all the time,
so it doesn't exercise all the strong 

175
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:57,620
strong muscle groups in your toes and,
and these things,

176
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:03,100
they actually lost a class action 
lawsuit I think because a bunch of 

177
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:07,451
people took them.
They started running and doing a bunch 

178
00:07:07,451 --> 00:07:07,451
of shit and they got hurt.
Really.

179
00:07:07,451 --> 00:07:09,950
So much assumption out here,
can't believe I do.

180
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,810
It's like,
cool,

181
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,390
this is not important.
Fuck you.

182
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,290
Fuck you.

183
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:22,870
I'm class action because people are 
getting hurt trying to run on fucking 

184
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:24,800
boulders and shit.
Well,

185
00:07:24,801 --> 00:07:29,801
because they lost the lawsuit because 
people were suing them because they said

186
00:07:29,901 --> 00:07:34,901
that they,
they made a unwarranted claims or 

187
00:07:34,901 --> 00:07:35,240
something along those lines.
That's what's killing us.

188
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:40,660
E-Cigarettes really,
because they were like safer than 

189
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:40,660
smoking.
And the FDA's like,

190
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:40,820
wait,
why do you think that?

191
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,830
Obviously like,
no,

192
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,880
no,
you can't just go obviously the medical 

193
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:47,880
side,
you have to like test it.

194
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,950
Yeah.
They don't have years and years of 

195
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:50,950
cancer behind prove.
I mean they,

196
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,670
they could easily be causing some new 
kind of cancer.

197
00:07:52,671 --> 00:07:53,630
I mean,
who the fuck knows?

198
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:58,750
I think it also be way safer,
but just like you got to prove that's 

199
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:58,910
it.
So um,

200
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:03,940
with these shoes,
I'm one of the things that people who 

201
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:07,871
are big proponents of.
I'm like this Guy Mark [inaudible] who 

202
00:08:07,871 --> 00:08:08,240
is the author of the primal blueprint.

203
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,240
He's a really well respected endurance 
athlete and then went on to become like 

204
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,710
coach and does a lot of online stuff and
writes books about diet and exercise.

205
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:24,910
He says you gotta take it slow because 
essentially your foot is just not used 

206
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:28,811
to really working.
That's used to being protected by your 

207
00:08:28,811 --> 00:08:30,560
toe.
Basing out for balance,

208
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:35,740
especially with these things,
these things that your toes are all 

209
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,891
individually moving and essentially it's
just providing you a little bit of a 

210
00:08:39,711 --> 00:08:42,230
thick layer underneath to keep you from 
getting cut.

211
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:45,140
Oh,
but your foot does all the work.

212
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:48,290
I've met these people in Cambodia that 
had a on this island,

213
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:51,670
this is a parasite that lives there and 
um,

214
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:54,470
they just get it and you see this worm 
inside your leg and shit.

215
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,250
Oh,
Jesus.

216
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:00,320
Yeah.
And you got to go to the hospital and 

217
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:00,320
take it out.

218
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:00,320
But like a or maybe drink some stuff.
I forget how they got rid of it,

219
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,620
but it's just like everybody was like,
it's not going to happen to me.

220
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:02,900
And then like,
yeah,

221
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:06,120
it happens to,
you just need a little bit of scratch as

222
00:09:06,121 --> 00:09:07,790
you're walking nearby them and they're 
like,

223
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,420
we're in a little.
Yeah,

224
00:09:09,421 --> 00:09:11,430
you can see it inside your skin,
like moving.

225
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:14,160
Oh,
I can fucking wrath of Khan.

226
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:19,610
I had this guy on my podcast recently,
Dr Robert Sapolsky and he's an expert 

227
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,300
in,
um,

228
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,320
well he's an expert.
A lot of things.

229
00:09:22,321 --> 00:09:25,170
But one of the things he specializes in 
is this,

230
00:09:25,171 --> 00:09:28,760
a parasite called toxoplasma.
That's the Brazilian one,

231
00:09:28,761 --> 00:09:29,610
right?
Yeah.

232
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:32,780
Yeah.
And he was freaking me the fuck out you.

233
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:35,230
Will you have it?
I've definitely have it.

234
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:38,880
Yeah.
If it's that anger thing.

235
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,450
Oh yeah.
The crazy thing to race.

236
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:45,900
What did you just get mad and fuck all 
the time to get mad and fuck disease?

237
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:47,230
Yeah.
It's um,

238
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:50,010
he says 50 percent of the population has
it in the world.

239
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,200
Yep.
Fifty percent.

240
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:54,570
And nobody in Poland?
No one.

241
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:55,300
No.
I'm just like,

242
00:09:55,490 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm just stereotyping.
It's so crazy how it works,

243
00:10:00,001 --> 00:10:05,001
how it infects the cat and the only 
place where it can reproduce this in a 

244
00:10:05,001 --> 00:10:09,441
cat's digestive tract.
And that's how it forced itself to 

245
00:10:09,441 --> 00:10:09,441
survive.
Yeah.

246
00:10:09,441 --> 00:10:13,621
By tricking a rat into going near a cat,
it kills the rats.

247
00:10:15,001 --> 00:10:17,310
Fear of cats.
See Again?

248
00:10:17,311 --> 00:10:19,320
You see the little hairs here and there?
Yeah.

249
00:10:19,321 --> 00:10:23,100
That's an animal that's killing animals.
Most likely that's a kylie,

250
00:10:23,101 --> 00:10:24,770
but that's pretty big.
That's,

251
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,610
that's some big shit there.
Bears out here.

252
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,200
No,
not out here,

253
00:10:28,201 --> 00:10:33,201
but not too far away.
Santa Barbara has bears are the rattle 

254
00:10:33,201 --> 00:10:33,201
snakes here.
Got To be that right?

255
00:10:33,201 --> 00:10:34,580
I ran over one.
What?

256
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:35,340
Um,
yeah,

257
00:10:35,341 --> 00:10:38,280
with my dogs a couple years back.
Was a waterfall.

258
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:39,270
Yeah.
Um,

259
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:43,500
where I thought it was a stick.
It was a big stick across the ground and

260
00:10:43,501 --> 00:10:45,720
as I was jumping over,
the dog's already passed it.

261
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:51,020
I realized in the Air I was jumping over
off of that huge dude,

262
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:53,710
but they're looking at,
you know,

263
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:57,570
anybody just look and try to stay there 
as long as you could know.

264
00:10:57,571 --> 00:11:02,150
I put the dogs away because that was 
when I had pit bulls and they'd go after

265
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,120
three times by rattlesnakes.
Yep.

266
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:10,340
I just have to take them to the doctor 
and it's super expensive to get 

267
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,940
antivenom.
Damn huge pain.

268
00:11:11,941 --> 00:11:13,140
The Dick,
you know.

269
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,770
Um,
but where were we?

270
00:11:16,771 --> 00:11:17,870
Oh yeah.
Toxoplasma.

271
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,670
Yeah.
It affects the rats,

272
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:23,160
convinces the rats.
That cat's.

273
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,710
Not only does it take away the fear of 
cats,

274
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:31,110
but it rewires their sexual reward 
system and makes them attracted to cat 

275
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:31,620
piss.
That's amazing.

276
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,120
They get hard ons.
That's amazing.

277
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,250
Since that's like if there was nobody to
reproducing.

278
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:36,930
If there was some disease,
it was like no,

279
00:11:36,931 --> 00:11:38,110
fat checks are pretty.
Yeah.

280
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,540
And then you would just have to go for 
them.

281
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,550
We just like,
have you heard of this new tick?

282
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:45,570
There's a new,
a new tick,

283
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:47,370
a disease for sure.
The answer is no,

284
00:11:47,371 --> 00:11:48,420
I have not heard of it.
Well,

285
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:52,770
it gives you a meat allergy and it's 
spreading through Texas,

286
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:57,950
so it's called the lone star tick.
So you're allergic to meat after you've 

287
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:57,950
got it.
Literally.

288
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:58,870
And then what does that do?
Well,

289
00:11:58,871 --> 00:12:02,110
there's a,
there's a chemical called Alpha Gal.

290
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:07,420
It's like a alpha go lactamase or some 
shit and forget how to say it,

291
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:12,900
but this stuff is in this tick bite and 
when it gets into your system it makes 

292
00:12:15,881 --> 00:12:17,320
you literally allergic to meat.

293
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:20,980
And so people who were like rabid 
carnivores,

294
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:23,860
radiolab did an art or a podcast about 
it.

295
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:27,460
And the podcast is called Alpha Alphago.
Alphago,

296
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,640
Alpha Gal.
Gal like a girl.

297
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,080
Yeah.
And so it makes religion to meet.

298
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:34,960
So to what end?
What purpose?

299
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:38,680
There's no purpose.
It's just,

300
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:44,240
it's like lyme disease.
It's a side effect of getting bit by a 

301
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,250
tick.
He's Cunty bugs a ton of our bullshit.

302
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,150
Too many men.
If they teamed up.

303
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:54,530
Yeah.
I started thinking about it when people 

304
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:55,020
said like,
could you be like 12,

305
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:57,040
12 year olds?
Fuck up 12,

306
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:57,740
12 year old.
Okay,

307
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,950
sure.
Maybe 100 percent.

308
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,170
What if they're organized?
I don't know.

309
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:02,950
They don't have a chance.
They don't have a chance.

310
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:06,250
If they all come at you at once and they
don't care about getting beat up.

311
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:08,500
First of all,
everybody cares about getting beat up.

312
00:13:08,501 --> 00:13:10,000
You're talking about non humans now.

313
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:15,270
Well wait,
what if you start training them at a 

314
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:15,270
young age?
I'm going to fuck them up.

315
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:19,180
They don't have a chance.
The first one's going to get kicked 

316
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:22,261
into.
A person's going to get kicked hard for 

317
00:13:22,261 --> 00:13:23,851
sure.
And then panic and then I'm just going 

318
00:13:23,851 --> 00:13:24,340
to start smashing,
so.

319
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,510
Okay.
Okay.

320
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:30,100
That's a $200.
Go right through those cons.

321
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:31,340
Yeah.
Yeah.

322
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,410
They're just like,
hey,

323
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:37,411
go beat up joe.
And whoever beats him up gets a 

324
00:13:37,411 --> 00:13:37,411
lollipop.
You don't take those guys,

325
00:13:37,411 --> 00:13:38,280
but if it's a trained army of 12 year 
olds,

326
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:41,350
they're fucked because I'm trained.
Listen,

327
00:13:41,351 --> 00:13:44,500
if I had a fight,
me and 10 other dudes were gonna fight a

328
00:13:44,501 --> 00:13:46,290
500 pound man.
That's more coyotes.

329
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:47,730
Shit.
That was a weird looking ones.

330
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:48,880
It's all berry.
Yeah.

331
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:50,390
Eat Berries.
They eat a lot of berries.

332
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:53,020
Um,
if I had to,

333
00:13:53,021 --> 00:13:55,840
uh,
get 10 friends.

334
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,310
Yeah.
And we had a fight,

335
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:01,060
a 500 pound hulking man,
we'd be fucked.

336
00:14:01,061 --> 00:14:02,410
Who'd be fucked?
We'd be fucked.

337
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,490
We didn't,
wouldn't have a chance.

338
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:08,580
What about 12 like Duncan trussell's.
Could you take that a little bit bigger 

339
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:12,661
than his current form?
Current Florence absolutely wouldn't 

340
00:14:12,661 --> 00:14:12,661
have a chance.

341
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:19,240
One of them in front of me at some point
and all you have to do is hit that one 

342
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:23,850
and the other ones are gonna panic.
That's why I never said about the Bruce 

343
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:23,850
Lee movies when they would come out of 
one of the time.

344
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:25,840
Exactly.
And maybe sometimes two at a time,

345
00:14:25,841 --> 00:14:29,710
but never in the same.
Like it was just like wagon grab them,

346
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:34,740
just grab them.
The problem with Duncan as he wouldn't 

347
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:34,740
be able to really do any damage.
If he got close,

348
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,210
he could punch your square in the jaw 
and you'd laugh it off like via Berakah.

349
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:38,950
Yeah.
You'd be like,

350
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:41,320
okay,
that all you got?

351
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:46,740
Yeah.
But if you had to deal with like three 

352
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:46,740
burke crisis,
right?

353
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,590
I'm probably going to get fucked up.
Yeah.

354
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:54,410
Even if he's not a trained fighter,
most likely you'd have to.

355
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:58,160
You have to really make sure you connect
hard on that first guy.

356
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,040
The first guy you have to take out 
immediately.

357
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:02,540
Hard as hard as you can.
Yeah.

358
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:07,541
You have to blast him.
You'll also have to show consequences 

359
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:08,780
for everybody else to let them know,
like,

360
00:15:08,781 --> 00:15:13,781
hey,
you're not going to get a free shot on 

361
00:15:13,781 --> 00:15:13,781
me.
I'm going to fucking kill you.

362
00:15:13,781 --> 00:15:14,180
Stomp their face in as our down.
Oh yeah.

363
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:15,710
I'd say my dad's what?
They taught him,

364
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,860
the Israeli army and these are the old 
days,

365
00:15:18,861 --> 00:15:21,770
you know?
And they said there's a good chance it's

366
00:15:21,771 --> 00:15:25,790
going to be you with no weapons up 
against two Arabs with no weapons.

367
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,880
Like that's a decent chance.
And he said,

368
00:15:28,881 --> 00:15:31,100
here's what you do.
Look in both in.

369
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,920
You look at the one on the whatever on 
the right,

370
00:15:33,921 --> 00:15:38,921
let's say,
and then you just kick the one on the 

371
00:15:38,921 --> 00:15:40,871
left and the balls as hard as you can,
this as hard as you can and try to 

372
00:15:40,871 --> 00:15:40,871
incapacitate him that way.

373
00:15:40,871 --> 00:15:41,870
He goes one-on-one,
you'll beat any Arab,

374
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:47,900
just have this attitude.
Well,

375
00:15:47,901 --> 00:15:49,640
they're so well trained to.
The Arabs were Kinda like,

376
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:52,440
you know,
militia army's a fucking,

377
00:15:52,441 --> 00:15:53,570
you know,
calisthenics,

378
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:59,470
you know,
and the fucking jungle gym to train and 

379
00:15:59,470 --> 00:15:59,470
they goes,
you'd be him and then come back and kill

380
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:00,520
the first one.
Hmm.

381
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:05,980
Interesting.
Did you have to raise a kitten and then 

382
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,390
kill it?
So favorite then make you raise it like 

383
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:10,060
the eggs and in home ec?
Yeah.

384
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:10,970
And then,
uh,

385
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,370
then you have to bring a snack,
right to break his neck at the present.

386
00:16:13,371 --> 00:16:15,050
A healthy kitten that you've raised for 
weeks.

387
00:16:15,051 --> 00:16:16,160
Wow.
That beautiful pond.

388
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,670
Get a lot of crayfish in those ponds.
Really?

389
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,110
Yeah.
When it was raining a lot,

390
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:26,380
this would turn into a river and uh,
like during the middle of the spring 

391
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,480
hopes the middle of the spring.
It was a pretty thick with water down 

392
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:31,480
here.

393
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,170
It would go all the way up to that high 
spot over there.

394
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:38,590
We're over there.
She was just like see those rocks a 

395
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:40,190
little bit higher,
like maybe two or three feet above where

396
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:44,030
the water was pretty awesome.
But that was just when all the water was

397
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:46,280
coming down from the mountains.
It all comes down here,

398
00:16:46,281 --> 00:16:46,760
Huh?
Yeah.

399
00:16:46,761 --> 00:16:49,520
It was the runoff from the snow.
Then followed by the heavy rains that we

400
00:16:49,521 --> 00:16:52,610
had for days and days.
We had some amazing rainfall.

401
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:53,980
Really?
Yeah.

402
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:55,670
To the point where my basement got 
flooded.

403
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:56,690
Really?
Yup.

404
00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:01,870
Where people like a complaining about it
in Hollywood because all they say is we 

405
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:01,870
need rain,
rain,

406
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:06,880
rain,
and then it happens two years later and 

407
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:06,880
like enough with this dude,
three days in a row,

408
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,310
people are going to move to this room.
I'm like,

409
00:17:07,311 --> 00:17:12,311
shut the fuck up.
No one feels the Goddamn a drought in 

410
00:17:12,311 --> 00:17:12,311
Hollywood.

411
00:17:12,311 --> 00:17:13,010
Exactly.
It was just like,

412
00:17:13,011 --> 00:17:18,011
Nah,
I'm going to run my water while I turn 

413
00:17:18,011 --> 00:17:19,820
the water on the waters road here.
And then there's no corn suddenly.

414
00:17:19,821 --> 00:17:20,690
And you're like,
what happened?

415
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:26,080
Well,
I feel like people need some kind of 

416
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,400
weather in order to really appreciate 
the good,

417
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:30,890
the good stuff.
Like you need some rain.

418
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:34,340
Like that was like growing up in the 
east coast.

419
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,480
It snowed.
So when summertime came around,

420
00:17:37,481 --> 00:17:40,410
you appreciated that you were in your 
shorts,

421
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:44,480
like you the time it got to the 60 and 
you're like,

422
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:46,140
let's do this.
Fuck,

423
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,590
good song.
That's my favorite thing about New York.

424
00:17:48,591 --> 00:17:51,480
Everyone feels it together and then when
it's finally gets warmed,

425
00:17:51,481 --> 00:17:52,260
the whole cities,
like,

426
00:17:52,261 --> 00:17:52,980
we did it.
You guys,

427
00:17:52,981 --> 00:17:54,000
we survived.
Some of us,

428
00:17:54,001 --> 00:17:55,830
not all of us.
And then it's like,

429
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,120
let's enjoy it.
Let's go out.

430
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,190
There's something to that for sure.

431
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:04,760
In a over where I was,
there's three seasons that have for 

432
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:05,880
winter,
summer and rainy.

433
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:07,050
Oh really?
Yeah.

434
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:10,140
And when it's rainy season,
it's rainy season.

435
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:13,170
Well,
I think that it's just like every single

436
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:14,070
day.
Wow.

437
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,420
Yeah,
I think that's good.

438
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:21,080
I think it's indicative of sort of 
family with what's wrong with 

439
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:21,080
California.
We.

440
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:26,200
Yeah.
We were like spoiled rich kids with a 

441
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,430
trust fund baby.
What happened?

442
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:29,040
Lizard fucking loser.
But it came right at me.

443
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,880
Jesus who's threatening,
um,

444
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:37,090
would just trust fund babies for whether
we're just so used to everything being 

445
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:38,670
amazing in January.
All you need is a t shirt.

446
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,770
The fuck is that in January?
Man?

447
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:43,770
What the fuck?
Skiing and I hung out in jeans and a tee

448
00:18:43,771 --> 00:18:44,850
shirt.
It's insane.

449
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:49,220
I'm out.
These trails is great.

450
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,020
A great.
Nobody's ever on them too.

451
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:56,990
I go run.
And these things do the same for the 

452
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:56,990
weekends.
Oh yeah.

453
00:18:56,990 --> 00:19:00,000
That was to me,
it's like I'll never try to do anything 

454
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,000
on a weekend because that's when the 
amateurs come out.

455
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,510
Right.
I'm like runyon.

456
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:02,160
Yeah.
It's like [inaudible] don't even.

457
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,700
Don't just wait til Monday.
Yeah.

458
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:07,050
Because there's got to be a benefit to 
doing this kind of Weirdo jobs.

459
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,550
Yeah.
And that is,

460
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,290
you know,
play golf on a Wednesday.

461
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,370
Right?
Exactly.

462
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:19,230
The appeal goes stuff,
not just the little window until we go 

463
00:19:20,491 --> 00:19:21,780
back,
go,

464
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:24,060
oh yeah,
that's all a pill on the way back.

465
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:27,450
This is the first appeal.
Now this is the fucking hiking man.

466
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:30,570
Yeah.
It's great exercise to man.

467
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:33,360
Yeah.
You get some sun on your skin and hiking

468
00:19:33,361 --> 00:19:34,970
with weight on your backs.
Amazing.

469
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:41,140
Good for your legs.
So I did a three day hike and me and 

470
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,730
mark and some company like take your 
stuff to look at another location and 

471
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:49,110
all you do is go with like a daypack oh 
yeah,

472
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:50,190
yeah.
But you know,

473
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:55,250
15 pounds,
15 pounds is what you got on you and 

474
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:58,440
it's great.
You come out of it so fucking refreshed.

475
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:01,590
I feel good.
And just like,

476
00:20:01,591 --> 00:20:02,820
okay,
now it's time for a beer.

477
00:20:02,821 --> 00:20:05,190
I've earned it.
You want to pause before the uphill?

478
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:08,040
We can.
Where's the OCO right there?

479
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:13,700
Well,
usually around here if I'm running a 

480
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:13,700
mile and a half.
Yeah,

481
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,860
I stopped right at that crest.
You run all this around.

482
00:20:16,861 --> 00:20:18,380
All this and those roots.
Yup.

483
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,480
Yup.
Wow.

484
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:21,690
Yeah.
I go hard,

485
00:20:21,691 --> 00:20:26,691
dude.
I'm trying to get in really good shape 

486
00:20:26,691 --> 00:20:28,980
for hunting because I'm the kind of 
shape I'm in.

487
00:20:28,981 --> 00:20:32,040
It's like Jujitsu shape,
kickboxing shape,

488
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,560
weight lifting shape,
quick hits,

489
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:37,410
quick bursts instead of just a big 
difference between that and hiking,

490
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:43,160
hiking in the mountains in particular.
Then never give up a golf ball here.

491
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,140
Somebody,
a Paul is up there.

492
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,010
I know you a weird thing about litter,
which I

493
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:50,170
don't,
but when I'm in the fucking woods,

494
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:55,590
that's when I have the weird thing.
I always feel like her math and up one 

495
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:58,420
item.
People get weird with me about how weird

496
00:20:58,421 --> 00:21:03,421
I am with litter.
Weird about cigarette butts on sunset 

497
00:21:03,421 --> 00:21:03,421
boulevard.
Yeah.

498
00:21:03,421 --> 00:21:05,270
It's like,
do they have Mexicans for this coming?

499
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,350
I chase receipts down the street that 
are years.

500
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,460
Yeah,
and I hate.

501
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:14,490
I hate the idea that I'm literally.
I remember being in Denver wants with 

502
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:14,490
the,
with the,

503
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:18,300
with the.
When we toured like a policy we get mad 

504
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:22,531
at me and red band was like,
don't fucking throw water on the ground 

505
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:25,420
in beautiful denver thing.
People with cigarettes.

506
00:21:25,421 --> 00:21:27,070
Do they just throw it on the ground 
step?

507
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:30,040
If it goes out the window of their car,
they just don't want to see it.

508
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:31,300
It's out of sight,
out of mind.

509
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,640
Oh,
what is that?

510
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:38,840
Is that it took some kind of bug.
It is a tick dude who killed that 

511
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,040
fucker.
Why did you.

512
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:40,030
Why did you kill it?
Well,

513
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,800
there's a million of them.
Go and bite your mom.

514
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:44,040
Just like Peter Parker,
everyone,

515
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:46,270
Peter Parker that got killed.
Uncle Ben.

516
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,170
Yeah.
He let him go.

517
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,560
Let them go.
You're right at that ticket.

518
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,040
Going to have lyme disease.
We're definitely gonna.

519
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:56,041
Be Thinking about it.
Do you ever go back and I get that 

520
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:56,041
fucking meet disease.
That'd be so bad at you.

521
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:58,740
If it's.
That chick sounds down,

522
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,780
jump right back up.
Find that content.

523
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:04,060
No Way.
No Way.

524
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:07,780
At some time you could find them if you 
were totally dedicated.

525
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:09,250
You think so?
Yeah.

526
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:13,260
He didn't go that far,
but he's still a small foot square.

527
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,140
That was a tick though,
right?

528
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:17,200
I think it was flat.
Red looked very ticklish.

529
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,030
Now,
luckily for us,

530
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:21,430
there's not a whole lot of lyme disease 
out here,

531
00:22:21,431 --> 00:22:23,470
but it does exist and it's spreading.

532
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:26,110
What happens if you have a tick that's 
no longer disease,

533
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:28,420
but it still gets you just make you 
weak.

534
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:33,630
It makes you itchy.
Just county little bugs trying to suck 

535
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:34,570
blood out of you.
I pulled them off.

536
00:22:34,571 --> 00:22:36,010
My Dog's fault.
They swell up.

537
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:37,420
Yeah.
Yeah.

538
00:22:37,421 --> 00:22:39,160
They swell up with blood and they're 
just,

539
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,780
Oh,
they're disgusting.

540
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,860
I was in show doc,
speaking of litter.

541
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:44,260
Where's that?
Southern?

542
00:22:44,261 --> 00:22:45,740
Southern Vietnam.
Ho Man.

543
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,770
They take about 10 hour bus down.
Damn.

544
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,570
Yeah man.
It's traveling,

545
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:55,060
but there's just like floating forest 
where these trees grow out of this.

546
00:22:55,061 --> 00:23:00,061
Like just this water and then there's 
like lily pads everywhere so it just 

547
00:23:00,061 --> 00:23:01,750
looks like grass and trees coming out.
But you're on a boat through it.

548
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:03,220
Yeah,
it's pretty great.

549
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:08,870
It's pretty great.
But then we get off the boat and get 

550
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:08,870
onto the dock and this fucking Chinese 
guard.

551
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:09,190
They're the worst.

552
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:14,190
Travelers are the worst.
He just dumped a cigarette and you're 

553
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:14,190
like,
dude,

554
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:14,740
come on.
Nobody's here man.

555
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:18,130
There's no street sweeping here.
We're in the fucking woods.

556
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,510
Did you say something to them?
No,

557
00:23:19,511 --> 00:23:21,580
of course not.
Oh,

558
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,440
I don't want conflict,
but also it's like,

559
00:23:23,441 --> 00:23:26,360
what am I going to learn?
Chinese travelers are the worst that.

560
00:23:26,361 --> 00:23:28,690
That's why the Great Barrier Reef was 
dead really?

561
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:33,810
Because he said,
please don't put on sunscreen and 

562
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:33,810
Chinese people.
Like,

563
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:34,030
I'm just gonna put on all the sunscreen 
I have.

564
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,380
How about that?
No kidding.

565
00:23:35,381 --> 00:23:40,381
So they say don't put on sunscreen in 
the area of the great barrier while 

566
00:23:40,381 --> 00:23:40,381
you're scuba diving.
Also,

567
00:23:40,381 --> 00:23:44,641
you're covered in a wetsuit,
so like you don't really need just a 

568
00:23:44,641 --> 00:23:44,980
little on your neck and Parul on like 45
minutes before.

569
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,040
So that's what's killing the

570
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:48,800
reef is sunscreens are dead reef now 
it's dead.

571
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,110
We're going to clear.
Wow.

572
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:52,820
Which means it might be more than 50 
percent debt or something,

573
00:23:52,821 --> 00:23:55,520
but like it's been declared dead reef.
Holy Shit.

574
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:57,380
One of the greatest things in our 
fucking world.

575
00:23:57,590 --> 00:24:02,590
Holy Shit.
Killed by sunscreen and man's 

576
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:02,590
encroachment.
Dude.

577
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:04,550
I used to get sunscreen in my eyes when 
I used to.

578
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:09,700
Fear factor.
I would do fear factor in that had come 

579
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,761
to the store and I still have sunscreen 
on my forehead and I would start 

580
00:24:12,761 --> 00:24:15,320
sweating and the sunscreen getting my 
eyes and it was fucking terrible.

581
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:20,360
Would stink so bad.
I remember being on stage is crying.

582
00:24:20,361 --> 00:24:21,800
Tears run down later.
Oh,

583
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,380
because you have it all from the day?
Yeah,

584
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:25,760
I had it on during the day.
Then at the store at night,

585
00:24:25,761 --> 00:24:27,440
I'd be tearing.
I have to explain to people.

586
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,710
Sorry,
I was shooting outside all day and I got

587
00:24:30,711 --> 00:24:32,630
sunscreen in my fucking eyes.

588
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:37,490
That shit's terrible for you.
Can't smoke at her Kenyon a cigarette or

589
00:24:37,491 --> 00:24:39,350
we'd come on man.
I don't smoke cigarettes.

590
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,640
Oh yeah,
you can smoke weed.

591
00:24:40,641 --> 00:24:42,110
We could smoke some weed.
Arusha,

592
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,060
fear brought weed on a hike.
I like it.

593
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:50,330
I've cut down a lot on weed.
You should try weed and yoga.

594
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,640
Dude.
I did a bunch of yoga out there.

595
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:54,920
Did you like 12 times?
You'll like it.

596
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:59,980
Yeah.
I got to the point where there's one of 

597
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,781
my goals.
I wanted to touch my toes and I started 

598
00:25:01,781 --> 00:25:03,310
right below the knee and when I did it,
like I found it.

599
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,200
I can almost touch your toes now.
Yeah,

600
00:25:06,201 --> 00:25:08,570
that's a lot more flexible than you.
That's great.

601
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:13,680
Yeah.
That's one of the best things for your 

602
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,921
health.
And then just while I was on boats and 

603
00:25:14,921 --> 00:25:14,921
shit,
I was just like,

604
00:25:14,921 --> 00:25:14,921
do it a little bit,
you know,

605
00:25:14,921 --> 00:25:14,921
and you take these classes.

606
00:25:14,921 --> 00:25:15,770
They would teach me some moves and 
you're like,

607
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:18,080
oh reproduce that when I'm fucking 
sitting waiting for a bus.

608
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:19,220
Well,
you don't have a phone,

609
00:25:19,221 --> 00:25:24,221
but if you did have a phone,
you just use your app or a cover 

610
00:25:24,221 --> 00:25:24,221
classes.
Yeah.

611
00:25:24,221 --> 00:25:25,670
Well you.
If you have a computer,

612
00:25:25,671 --> 00:25:27,620
obviously when you go on the road or 
even at your house,

613
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:31,610
just turn on a yoga program on now.
Youtube,

614
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:35,420
just someone who's got a yoga workout.
You follow the yoga workout.

615
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:40,450
It's simple.
You don't have to go anywhere or you 

616
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:40,450
have to do anything.
Oh yeah.

617
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:42,930
It's amazing and once you learn it then 
you can get an you.

618
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:45,650
I know you don't use a phone,
but I have an app on my phone that shows

619
00:25:45,651 --> 00:25:48,410
me the move and then times me really 
tells me to stop.

620
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,110
Yeah.
Good.

621
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,390
My ipad.
I could do that at home.

622
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:52,250
Yeah.
Do that.

623
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:57,580
Yeah.
There were a bunch of things where I'm 

624
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:57,580
like,
I have to miss a phone for that form,

625
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,700
for that.
Well,

626
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:01,880
what you're doing is admirable though.
You realize your limitations.

627
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:07,280
I've slacked off heavy on social,
social media backed way.

628
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:08,330
What?
For what reasons?

629
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:13,450
Get work done right.
You do understand that that draws you 

630
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:14,610
out.
My writing has gotten much,

631
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,210
much more prolific.
It much better.

632
00:26:17,211 --> 00:26:22,211
I was thinking about your improvement or
the way you pluck out hit your last 

633
00:26:22,211 --> 00:26:23,110
special.
You know what I think of it right?

634
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:26,900
[inaudible] you think a lot of that's 
got.

635
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:31,990
I mean some people said what about 
podcasts is always working as mind was 

636
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:31,990
like,
but he was already doing podcasts.

637
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:32,900
Podcast for years.
You think some of this back of the store

638
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:36,680
checking out just in front of people on 
the back of the store cracked me up.

639
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,710
You crack me up,
cracked me up another solid notch.

640
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:41,410
You see some other great comics.
Yeah.

641
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:42,170
Hmm.
Interesting.

642
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:44,010
Being back there too.
I got energized and

643
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:49,010
then getting all the support from all 
the people because I'm back there again 

644
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:50,160
too and being around like a real 
camaraderie.

645
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:53,810
Seen a real a scene of peers where I 
wasn't.

646
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:58,870
I didn't have that before.
I was just showing up and I would do 

647
00:26:58,870 --> 00:26:59,550
gigs and I get out of there like with 
Diaz,

648
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:04,700
you know,
I do other road with you guys and I'd 

649
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:07,341
have fun then,
but when I was working out at the ha ha 

650
00:27:07,341 --> 00:27:07,341
or the Improv,
I just go and do my and get the fuck out

651
00:27:07,341 --> 00:27:07,400
of.
There was,

652
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,150
yeah,
at the store I'm hanging,

653
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:14,300
you know,
hours for hours to one with the car and 

654
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:14,300
he says to not yell or whatever last 
week.

655
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:18,780
Yeah.
It was the first time I'd been there in 

656
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:18,780
a long time.
We used to go there all the time,

657
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,800
all the time.
For me it was like more than a decade.

658
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:22,710
More than inside a cornice.
How long were you gone for?

659
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:23,820
Seven years.
Seven years.

660
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:25,440
Wow.
Yeah.

661
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:27,300
Crazy.
Wow.

662
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:32,390
Seven long ass years.
But I had really great sets,

663
00:27:32,911 --> 00:27:36,930
really did good specials and bats 
specials when I was gone,

664
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:39,660
but the bad special that I did wasn't 
bad,

665
00:27:39,661 --> 00:27:41,550
but it wasn't real good.
It was 2012.

666
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:46,560
Ramped me up for the 2014 one which was 
talking about because in space,

667
00:27:46,561 --> 00:27:50,400
which was really good.
And then that ramp me up for triggered,

668
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:55,520
which is probably my best one,
but I think this new one is going to be 

669
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,071
better.
People are talking about your newstuff 

670
00:27:58,071 --> 00:27:58,071
the store.
I haven't seen her.

671
00:27:58,071 --> 00:27:58,380
No,
but uh,

672
00:27:58,381 --> 00:27:59,220
the door I like.
Oh,

673
00:27:59,221 --> 00:28:01,710
it's like on another level now.
I think it was like,

674
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:07,190
I don't know what it is.
It's not like rockstars will like 25 as 

675
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:07,190
their prime.
I don't know man.

676
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:07,540
I'm just,
I'm,

677
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,180
I'm not slacking off.

678
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:12,330
I think that's what it is.
I think we get to this point where we're

679
00:28:12,331 --> 00:28:17,331
dedicated to something and we get good 
at it or we get successful at it at 

680
00:28:17,331 --> 00:28:20,340
least.
And then once you get some adulation you

681
00:28:20,341 --> 00:28:22,110
sort of relaxed.
Like I kinda got it.

682
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:24,540
I know what I'm doing now,
now let me fucking go.

683
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:29,720
Yeah.
Nobody's gonna make me think about 

684
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,131
quitting.
If I do a bad set that needs 

685
00:28:31,131 --> 00:28:31,131
improvement.
So now my,

686
00:28:31,131 --> 00:28:33,720
my opinion is totally different now it's
all about,

687
00:28:33,721 --> 00:28:38,721
look,
I know that the only way I'm really 

688
00:28:38,721 --> 00:28:41,661
happy is if my is good.
Like if everything in my life is going 

689
00:28:41,661 --> 00:28:41,661
great,
but I bomb,

690
00:28:41,661 --> 00:28:43,320
I am not happy.
Okay.

691
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,730
So how do I fix that?
Well,

692
00:28:44,731 --> 00:28:46,960
I have to fucking work more at my stand 
up.

693
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:52,100
I have to just whatever it is.
So I wrote down on my computer and on my

694
00:28:52,411 --> 00:28:57,240
phone a schedule that I have to adhere 
to every week and one of them is I write

695
00:28:57,241 --> 00:28:59,150
five hours every week,
a week ago.

696
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:04,400
It's attainable.
You don't go crazy like seinfeld where 

697
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,981
it's like eight hours a day.
It's like I'm not gonna hit that and 

698
00:29:06,981 --> 00:29:07,500
then I'll fail.
Then they tell people not to try to quit

699
00:29:07,501 --> 00:29:09,540
smoking their first year because they're
like,

700
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:10,830
you're,
it's way harder.

701
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:13,380
So you're going to feel that and then 
you're going to.

702
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,510
It's gonna make it think like fuck it.
Just go back to everything.

703
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:16,890
Yeah,
like don't even try that.

704
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:19,470
So that's where I think make attainable 
goals.

705
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:19,840
Uh,
yeah.

706
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:23,270
I also set attainable goals for like 
fitness too,

707
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,310
like the amount of times a week I do 
yoga,

708
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:28,290
the amount of times a week I run.
And I think all those,

709
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,240
they like,
they,

710
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:34,350
they build on each other,
like the momentum of them and it makes 

711
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:37,011
the stand up better.
And then also like just thinking about 

712
00:29:37,011 --> 00:29:37,011
the standup,
like thinking about the set,

713
00:29:37,011 --> 00:29:38,460
trying to make it better.
Trying to like,

714
00:29:38,461 --> 00:29:41,290
how much of this is bullshit,
how much of this is ego?

715
00:29:41,291 --> 00:29:42,130
How much of this is just,

716
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:44,080
I haven't looked at it enough,
I need to get it better.

717
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:49,260
How much of this is.
I only came out of this one way and I 

718
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:49,260
stuck with that way.
Why don't I come at it another way?

719
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,950
Like,
I've been doing that a lot now.

720
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,410
That's how I see a tail doing that where
it's like,

721
00:29:53,411 --> 00:29:55,180
let me change one word around now.
Back now,

722
00:29:55,181 --> 00:29:56,920
back again when it's like,
I dunno,

723
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:58,270
just because I've been doing doesn't 
make it right.

724
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,350
Yeah.
You never know dude.

725
00:29:59,351 --> 00:30:04,351
Like sometimes you'll,
you'll be excited and you'll switch it 

726
00:30:04,351 --> 00:30:08,880
and it'll be way better.
But you don't know until you until you 

727
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:08,880
like get out of there,
you've got to do it.

728
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,230
I always thought that's what hell Bobby 
Lee back for a long time was that he was

729
00:30:11,231 --> 00:30:13,180
always like showcase for pussy,
so it was like,

730
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,230
this is the best it is right now.

731
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:16,720
I'm not going to fucking go one time and
he's a great comic,

732
00:30:16,721 --> 00:30:20,830
but like he's not going to risk one time
trying to differently or try new shit.

733
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:22,560
Yeah,
I've talked to bobby about it.

734
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:26,310
I think bobby,
I'm just never did a special.

735
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:31,340
And if he did a special he'd be forced 
to write new stuff and I think his new 

736
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:32,670
stuff would really ultimately be way 
better than the stuff he's doing.

737
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,410
Not the stuff he's doing isn't really 
good.

738
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:35,640
It really.
He's really funny.

739
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:40,880
But I think bobby has ladies are more 
developed comic genius potential and 

740
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,230
he's just a little nervous about putting
stuff out there.

741
00:30:43,231 --> 00:30:45,360
I think so.
Um,

742
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:46,080
I don't know,
man.

743
00:30:46,081 --> 00:30:51,081
I just been paying more attention to it.
It's been trying to pay a lot of 

744
00:30:51,081 --> 00:30:51,270
attention to it.
Just put your phone through it.

745
00:30:51,271 --> 00:30:56,271
When you drive,
you think about when you listen to the 

746
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:58,241
recordings all the time,
like sometimes I'm listening to music 

747
00:30:58,241 --> 00:30:58,241
and I said,
you know what,

748
00:30:58,241 --> 00:30:58,950
I should be doing work.

749
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:04,310
I should be doing work,
let's dissect this fucking set and I 

750
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:04,980
don't want to and I don't want to listen
to podcasts.

751
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:09,570
Listen to your podcast or Duncan or 
burgers or something like that,

752
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:11,340
or Joey,
but I'll,

753
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:13,140
I'll,
I'll go over my head again.

754
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,370
I'll figure it out.
You know,

755
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:19,460
figure it out.
Yoshi said to me was who?

756
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:21,590
Who's The guy?
Jets?

757
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:26,740
Small five to Japanese.
Go in the old bomb squad.

758
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:29,860
He was there.
Yeah.

759
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:31,910
When he was like,
when I started and he was like,

760
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:36,250
I thought it had succeed,
you know,

761
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:38,450
talking about what you though.
But he goes,

762
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:40,280
here's what you gotta do you gotta think
about it all the time.

763
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:42,470
Like I think about digital all the time.
You'll get better.

764
00:31:42,471 --> 00:31:42,920
And I was like,
oh,

765
00:31:42,921 --> 00:31:44,300
I can't.
I already got something for that.

766
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:46,330
Yeah,
that's a real problem.

767
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:51,960
You have to have to figure out like how 
much energy you put into other stuff 

768
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:56,610
from me,
whether it's archery or used to be pool 

769
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:57,820
pool was the worst because you can't 
really do archery eight hours a day.

770
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:02,820
You'll get too tired,
but you can play pool eight hours day 

771
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:02,820
easy.
She's got a stretcher back.

772
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:07,651
Once in a while you just get more and 
more cycle about it and then it becomes 

773
00:32:07,651 --> 00:32:07,651
like,
okay,

774
00:32:07,651 --> 00:32:12,570
how much of this is benefiting me?
Is it benefiting me spending all this 

775
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:16,201
time tweaking about balls going into 
holes or is it like a big distraction 

776
00:32:16,201 --> 00:32:20,970
because I don't want to put that same 
amount of time into writing or into 

777
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:24,990
think about standing mean honestly.
There's a diminishing point of returns 

778
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:24,990
at some point,
you know,

779
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:27,240
but a thumb of anything else you think 
about is time.

780
00:32:27,241 --> 00:32:29,340
You're not spending thinking about.
Exactly.

781
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:31,530
Now there might be,
like we said,

782
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:34,410
nothing more than like 34 hours a week 
would be successful,

783
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:37,200
so taking away that time is okay above 
34.

784
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:39,680
Exactly.
Yeah.

785
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:43,640
It's interesting man.
It's like you also want recreation,

786
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:46,190
recreation,
work your mind out a little bit.

787
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:46,580
Yeah,
yeah,

788
00:32:46,581 --> 00:32:51,581
yeah.
Like I'm going to reload this or say 

789
00:32:51,581 --> 00:32:51,581
that I'm good.
Even like video games.

790
00:32:51,581 --> 00:32:56,291
I think if you.
As long as you don't get crazy with 

791
00:32:56,291 --> 00:32:58,721
them,
I think they're probably fun and 

792
00:32:58,721 --> 00:33:00,431
beneficial,
but the problem is if you start like 

793
00:33:00,431 --> 00:33:00,800
super getting into Jujitsu the way you 
are in a comedy,

794
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:03,100
you're comedy's going to take second 
position.

795
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:08,710
Scada York,
when she won that award for whatever 

796
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:08,710
dancer in the dark,
if you work the singer,

797
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:12,050
she did acting once,
half the awards.

798
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:13,300
Ha.
Yeah.

799
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:16,130
And then the will you can do that more.
And she was,

800
00:33:16,131 --> 00:33:17,810
she said she felt like cheating on 
music.

801
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,580
Ooh,
powerful bjork.

802
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:22,190
I saw her house in Iceland.
Yeah.

803
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:25,220
I saw a beat up a photographer and a 
video.

804
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:30,580
Someone was found around taking pictures
of her and she started beating around 

805
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:30,580
York.
Yeah.

806
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:33,100
Yeah.
Giving them a new bowls punches.

807
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:35,240
Some lady was like totally disrespecting
her.

808
00:33:35,241 --> 00:33:40,241
She was just like,
like had a camera like interface and 

809
00:33:40,241 --> 00:33:42,640
she's filming her and I guess words.
I don't know the exact scenario,

810
00:33:42,641 --> 00:33:44,090
but they had words,
really.

811
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:47,820
A Bjork Bjork what?
After that on her,

812
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:49,910
I believe.
Let me pull up that video.

813
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,340
Which Jamie,
pull up that video.

814
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:56,350
I'm a little high right now.
I don't really totally remember the 

815
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:59,261
story,
but I'm pretty sure she beat some 

816
00:33:59,261 --> 00:33:59,261
persons.
I would love to see.

817
00:33:59,261 --> 00:34:00,920
Who would you most like to see fight who
has no fighting experience?

818
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:05,940
Anything like that.
Like like a Angelina Jolie and trump to 

819
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:08,090
the death.
So the death.

820
00:34:08,091 --> 00:34:09,850
Absolutely.
Whoever you choose to do that.

821
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:12,020
I was going to say Angela and Jennifer 
Aniston.

822
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,230
Wow.
Damn fighting.

823
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:17,120
Wow.
That would be vicious.

824
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:22,560
Vicious.
Angelina Jolie's got crazy on her side 

825
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:22,560
though,
right?

826
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:22,560
I think Angelina Jolie.
We take it easily now that I mentioned.

827
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,720
Now they think about it.
She's got crazy.

828
00:34:23,721 --> 00:34:25,100
I was crazy.
She drinks blood.

829
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,320
Yeah.
She had an amulet filled with billy.

830
00:34:27,321 --> 00:34:29,500
Bob Thorton's.
She kept around.

831
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:33,920
How do you survive that as a career 
that's full on publicly crazy.

832
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:36,350
She's so gangster that's full on out 
there.

833
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:38,810
You don't want to fight that girl.
They'd be like fighting a wild cat.

834
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:42,440
She bite you for sure.
For sure.

835
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:43,370
For sure.
Dude,

836
00:34:43,371 --> 00:34:45,950
you're getting bit.
She's probably gonna fuck you up.

837
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:48,950
You're going to realize you took her 
lightly as you're going unconscious,

838
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:55,470
so I see where I went wrong.
Mashing your head off the side of a 

839
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:55,470
sync.
I feel like would attack.

840
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:59,300
She's fucking move like,
whoa.

841
00:34:59,301 --> 00:35:01,270
I didn't see that coming.
She would attack.

842
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,190
You ever see I let them in the remake of
that vampire movie.

843
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:09,580
Oh yeah.
You don't want that girl jumped on that 

844
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:09,580
guy under the bridge.

845
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:10,460
That's what Angelina Jolie would attach 
to you.

846
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,250
That's a good movie.
I forgot that movie.

847
00:35:13,251 --> 00:35:16,520
I saw the original one too and I thought
this movie is amazing.

848
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,040
And then I was like,
well they're gonna fuck up the remake.

849
00:35:19,041 --> 00:35:19,670
And they didn't.
They didn't.

850
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,560
They didn't.
They didn't fuck it up at all.

851
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:22,620
Like low budget.
Why?

852
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,900
I don't know.
They just nailed it.

853
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:25,190
Yeah,
it was really great.

854
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:27,170
It was good.
Even the remake was great.

855
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:28,090
Upside.
They did it.

856
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:31,310
They did it as sort of a new story,
but the same thing and you know what?

857
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:35,660
It's so hard to do a remake that it has 
to be undeniable.

858
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:40,870
Right?
And so it was good that it was 

859
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:40,870
undeniable and everybody's like,
that's pretty fucking good.

860
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:43,640
Do you ever see two movies are actually 
terrifying.

861
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:48,980
A kid vampire and the old man who was 
like loved her too because he's been 

862
00:35:48,991 --> 00:35:50,820
with it for whatever years.

863
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:54,570
Something about a kid vampire just 
scares the fuck out of us.

864
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:57,720
Holy Shit.
It could be amongst us.

865
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:02,560
A fucking kid vampire little like four 
foot tall thing run at you crazy.

866
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,170
I'm not allowed to hit back party.
He was like,

867
00:36:04,171 --> 00:36:05,950
wait,
can I go this?

868
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:08,070
And you can't even do anything.
Anyway.

869
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:10,200
Superhuman power.
Right?

870
00:36:10,201 --> 00:36:12,660
Even that little girl,
she could fuck those dudes up.

871
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,410
There was no chance of ever losing that 
had no chance.

872
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:19,700
No Way.
Fan Pirates are like on a totally 

873
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:19,700
different level.
They're not humans.

874
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:19,700
Who's that girl?
Actor.

875
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,850
She's good.
She's very good.

876
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,690
Like what I see a vampire is not like 
superman though.

877
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:29,730
Know exactly what are they not.
I don't think you can take to the heart.

878
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:34,820
Yeah,
but you got to get a stake in their 

879
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:34,820
heart.
Right,

880
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:34,820
so it's not that you couldn't be at that
point were not done.

881
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:35,790
He's going to kick your ass somehow or 
another.

882
00:36:35,791 --> 00:36:38,310
Becoming a vampire makes you way 
stronger.

883
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:40,770
Do they heal like wolverine?
I don't think they get hurt,

884
00:36:40,771 --> 00:36:45,771
dude.
I think until the state goes into the 

885
00:36:45,771 --> 00:36:45,771
heart,
you can't really hurt him.

886
00:36:45,771 --> 00:36:48,180
He should wear heart plates of steel up 
dude.

887
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:49,550
Like Wolverine.
Yeah.

888
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:52,260
But then they started changing that.
They started changing that,

889
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:54,510
right?
Like some of the later movies to like,

890
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:57,960
what was that movie?
Thirty days of night you guys die.

891
00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:03,430
I think daily is like sunlight to kill 
them with like silver or something.

892
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:07,260
Some of them they make up new rules.
Like you can kill them with silver,

893
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:08,200
you know,
like,

894
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:13,220
wait,
it's not a wearable that could do that 

895
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:13,220
in a movie.
He just got to like,

896
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:13,220
oh no,
that was wrong with those people thought

897
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,520
it's actually this.
We got bullets with garlic in it.

898
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:15,230
You're going to kill them.

899
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,100
Like black.
Remember that.

900
00:37:17,101 --> 00:37:20,130
Like garlic would kill them and then 
they had would tip bullets.

901
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:22,920
Yeah.
So you can use machine guns on them.

902
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:27,810
Blade,
the comic book Superhero Blade had these

903
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:32,840
teak wood knives.
He had wooden knives and he would hunt 

904
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,790
vampires.
It's stabbed them to death and they were

905
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:38,400
just had to have a wood knife.
So we got this super hard wood.

906
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:39,690
Wow.
Yeah.

907
00:37:39,691 --> 00:37:44,370
That was good dude.
The idea of vampires,

908
00:37:44,371 --> 00:37:49,371
I think it's haunted people forever 
because I think it's what people are 

909
00:37:49,371 --> 00:37:51,930
capable of at their very worst.
Drinking people's blood in human,

910
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:57,110
just being inhuman.
You heard about some of the shit that 

911
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:58,740
went down in Liberia.
What were during the civil war?

912
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:03,920
They were capturing children from,
from neighboring tribes would eat their 

913
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,890
flesh.
They would eat their heart.

914
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:10,280
This guy,
there was one of the vice pieces on 

915
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:10,920
Liberia where he talks about and 
describes how he would do it,

916
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:16,130
how he would go to a neighboring tribe,
captured one of their children and eat 

917
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:16,620
his heart.
Wow.

918
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:17,460
Yeah,
Dude.

919
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:20,220
I'm going there in December.
Oh my God.

920
00:38:20,221 --> 00:38:21,330
What are you doing all right.
No,

921
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:23,850
they're done with that now.
A lot of power.

922
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,800
Yeah.
Your friends have all gone back.

923
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:27,080
I'm going with somebody who was from 
there.

924
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:30,120
Jesus already stay home.
He's my buddy from college.

925
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:33,480
What do you mean?
Do you know how Liberia got started?

926
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,680
Yeah,
I just found out

927
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,600
we never knew that as kids,
right?

928
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:38,860
No,
no.

929
00:38:38,861 --> 00:38:40,660
I didn't know about until the vice 
series.

930
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:44,680
Apparently it's a.
They took a US slave colony,

931
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:47,410
freed slaves back to Africa,
Monroe,

932
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:52,740
Jesus Christ.
That's why they call their capital 

933
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:55,411
Monrovia.
Liberia just means liberated and then 

934
00:38:55,751 --> 00:38:57,280
chaos.
Well,

935
00:38:57,281 --> 00:38:57,970
yeah.
I mean,

936
00:38:57,971 --> 00:38:59,530
whatever had happened later.
Yeah,

937
00:38:59,531 --> 00:39:04,531
but I mean how could.
How crazy is it that that became one of 

938
00:39:04,531 --> 00:39:06,430
the most chaotic spots in Africa?
Wow.

939
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:07,690
I mean,
imagine someone,

940
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,340
npr.
There's like 10 years ago.

941
00:39:09,341 --> 00:39:10,750
They're like,
oh no,

942
00:39:10,751 --> 00:39:15,751
it's safe now.
They want people to come and how dare 

943
00:39:15,751 --> 00:39:15,751
they start walking back?

944
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:18,970
I don't know shit about Liberia by the 
way.

945
00:39:18,971 --> 00:39:21,570
If you're from Liberia,
I'm just talking Jamie.

946
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:22,800
Pull that up.
Place Jimmy.

947
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:24,010
Pull that up.
We'll go this way.

948
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:25,840
Oh,
I thought it was a loop.

949
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:27,970
Oh,
head rush.

950
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:30,910
It can me a second.
You know where you are.

951
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,070
Get a head rush.
Damn.

952
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,970
We went deep.
Stood up too fast.

953
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:35,050
Oh yeah.
I got too high.

954
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,910
That's what it was.
That's what it was.

955
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:40,140
That's been nice at air.
Oh yeah.

956
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:41,340
I have that in New York,
right?

957
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:43,320
Not really.
You get stuff here or there,

958
00:39:43,321 --> 00:39:47,080
but not the selection and the amount and
the fucking so serious illness about it.

959
00:39:47,081 --> 00:39:49,090
So silly.
Open it up.

960
00:39:49,091 --> 00:39:50,070
Stop.
Yeah.

961
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:56,130
Yeah.
Plus I was the only back for like a 

962
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:56,380
month,
so it's like haven't really been smoking

963
00:39:56,381 --> 00:39:58,900
that much.
Nice.

964
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:01,600
Is the land of it?
Yeah.

965
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,010
I give Colorado number one.
Oh,

966
00:40:06,011 --> 00:40:11,011
Colorado is way ahead of callum 
Washington state to attend like the way 

967
00:40:11,011 --> 00:40:11,860
the Norco and then Soco.
Yeah.

968
00:40:11,861 --> 00:40:16,861
Well you know what?
It's like Washington state or Oregon in 

969
00:40:16,861 --> 00:40:18,850
the summer in the mountains of Oregon 
gets real flush.

970
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,090
Hard to beat.
Yeah.

971
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:24,370
I feel like in Oregon everyone has their
own plant in their backyard or they want

972
00:40:24,371 --> 00:40:24,670
to be like,
hey,

973
00:40:24,671 --> 00:40:25,590
try mine.
Try Mine.

974
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:28,990
Yeah.
Those people aren't fucking around.

975
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:34,640
I'm actually,
I read an article and it said that they 

976
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:34,640
were not fucking around.
Wow.

977
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,950
Officially.
Yeah.

978
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:41,190
They come out.
The article is entitled or they fucking 

979
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:41,190
around.

980
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:47,260
Yeah.
All those Pacific northwest people,

981
00:40:47,261 --> 00:40:49,360
they know how to grow some weed.
Yeah.

982
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:50,560
Jesus,
by the way,

983
00:40:50,561 --> 00:40:52,450
my specialists out right now.
Today?

984
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:53,580
Yes.
Today.

985
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:54,470
Oh,
sorry.

986
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:57,970
Put this out.
Isn't really a double negative.

987
00:40:57,971 --> 00:41:02,971
It's called one side.
It's present it to you guys so people 

988
00:41:02,971 --> 00:41:04,720
can start streaming it right away right 
now too.

989
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:06,130
Yeah.
That's awesome.

990
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:07,390
Yeah.
Yeah.

991
00:41:07,391 --> 00:41:10,250
You happy with the way everything worked
out to fuck you?

992
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,060
Beautiful.
Fuck yeah.

993
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:15,640
This is exactly what I had to look at.
Envision on some sort of digital type.

994
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:21,750
You know,
where you could get one episode on the 

995
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:21,750
other.
Right?

996
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:21,750
Right.
Back to back.

997
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:23,710
Just click on them.
It's two different specials but similar.

998
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:25,480
That's awesome.
Yeah.

999
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,440
And then the actual special park came 
out really good.

1000
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:34,670
But I worked at hard talking to you 
about it too.

1001
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:36,190
I took all those intermissions in,
uh,

1002
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:38,300
in Scandinavia.
And then you were like,

1003
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,470
you gave me some good advice.
You're like,

1004
00:41:39,471 --> 00:41:40,670
that's fucking.
They used to it out there,

1005
00:41:40,671 --> 00:41:41,450
man.
Do it here.

1006
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:46,680
Yeah.
So I tried to run it here a bunch so I 

1007
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,330
got the hang of it.
So was nothing new in this weird,

1008
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:49,800
you know,
for the sake of weirdness.

1009
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:50,240
Right.

1010
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:53,990
Well,
it's very experimental man.

1011
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:57,470
I mean you're,
you're doing a lot of cool shit.

1012
00:41:57,471 --> 00:41:58,760
You haven't fun.
Yeah.

1013
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:01,460
You know,
that's what I get out of your podcast to

1014
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:07,250
your podcast is an enthusiastic view of 
the world.

1015
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:10,400
I mean that's,
you're the end of the day.

1016
00:42:10,401 --> 00:42:14,870
You're a very enthusiastic person.
You liked a lot of cool shit.

1017
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:16,430
Know,
like doing stuff,

1018
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,740
you know,
and for me like knowing you as long as I

1019
00:42:18,741 --> 00:42:23,480
have known you when you weren't doing so
good and you are depressed,

1020
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:27,200
it's so amazing seeing you.
So happy,

1021
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,880
isn't it weird bands.
Great.

1022
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:34,120
Forget about the starting to,
to good in comedy and also like 

1023
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:37,240
depression to like fucking fine,
you know.

1024
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:42,950
And I mean I'm sure there's a bunch of 
different factors

1025
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:45,400
physically,
right?

1026
00:42:45,401 --> 00:42:45,690
Yeah,
yeah.

1027
00:42:45,691 --> 00:42:47,450
Yeah.
And I think uh,

1028
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,830
I know you don't like this,
but I think those pills helped me.

1029
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:50,730
No,
no man.

1030
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:53,420
You're one of the best examples ever.
You and beast.

1031
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:56,010
You remember Brian and war machine.
He also.

1032
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:56,570
Oh wait,
no,

1033
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:57,490
I thought it went wrong.
Sorry.

1034
00:42:57,570 --> 00:43:01,340
What do you remember,
Brian?

1035
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:05,120
From a beast from 10th planet?
Yeah.

1036
00:43:05,121 --> 00:43:06,140
I sort of remember him.
Yeah,

1037
00:43:06,141 --> 00:43:06,500
yeah,
yeah,

1038
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:06,850
yeah,
yeah.

1039
00:43:06,851 --> 00:43:09,360
Remember handing her bad ass.
A Jujitsu player.

1040
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:12,060
Sick guard well helped him,
Bro.

1041
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,510
Yeah,
yeah.

1042
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:19,960
People want to put everything like black
and whites and it's like when they say 

1043
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:22,941
overprescribed,
that doesn't mean it's always going to 

1044
00:43:22,941 --> 00:43:22,941
be bad.
Yeah,

1045
00:43:22,941 --> 00:43:22,941
exactly.
You know,

1046
00:43:22,941 --> 00:43:24,090
that just means too much.
It's almost like with anything,

1047
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:28,230
it's like everybody that we know that 
has had pain pill problems,

1048
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,660
they took the pain pills because they 
worked.

1049
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:31,130
Right.

1050
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,890
You just kept going crazy.
I mean if we're having a brain fart.

1051
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,510
Yeah.
I had to check himself in.

1052
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:37,500
Oh well dude,
buddy,

1053
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:40,560
Brendan Schaub had an issue.
His friends really had to take the pills

1054
00:43:40,561 --> 00:43:45,561
from him who's taking them every day,
several times a day for like months and 

1055
00:43:45,561 --> 00:43:46,620
his friends came over to south side.
Hey Dude,

1056
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:47,190
dude,
dude,

1057
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,650
no more of these.
And he said he,

1058
00:43:49,890 --> 00:43:52,110
you know,
he had to kick it and it was hard.

1059
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:58,730
But he's a disciplined athlete.
He's a strong minded dude.

1060
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,330
You know,
he could kick it,

1061
00:44:00,331 --> 00:44:05,331
but maybe if you're like a week of 
willed person that's more inclined to 

1062
00:44:05,331 --> 00:44:07,530
give into things.
Maybe you know,

1063
00:44:07,531 --> 00:44:09,840
maybe we gave you or maybe if you have a
chemical imbalance,

1064
00:44:09,841 --> 00:44:12,300
it makes you look really super.
We'd come off it.

1065
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:13,410
They're like,
okay,

1066
00:44:13,411 --> 00:44:15,510
here's the deal.
You got to come off it real slow.

1067
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:20,890
See I was on 100,
let me think if I'm right and 50 

1068
00:44:20,890 --> 00:44:24,210
milligrams of the Superman.
And they were like,

1069
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:29,240
all right,
and that's what we found that through 

1070
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:29,240
experimentation and then they go,
when you coming off it,

1071
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:31,800
quarter 1:25
for a week everyday for a week

1072
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:37,700
and then always monitor yourself.
If you start thinking about suicide at 

1073
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:37,700
all,
you got to call me immediately.

1074
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:39,840
Go back on a regular dose.
Jesus Christ,

1075
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:41,520
they tell you to like really like be 
careful,

1076
00:44:41,521 --> 00:44:43,800
but not everybody does.
And they go,

1077
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:44,640
fuck it.
I'm done with that.

1078
00:44:44,641 --> 00:44:46,170
That was my last position I want to go 
back to write,

1079
00:44:46,171 --> 00:44:48,690
right?
Well I think the better example might be

1080
00:44:48,691 --> 00:44:52,680
the pain pill thing because it's painful
for them to stop.

1081
00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:54,120
Oh right.
You're like,

1082
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:56,090
they ate.
I mean,

1083
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:58,290
I think they're all crazy.
It's everything has.

1084
00:44:58,291 --> 00:45:01,140
It's this way.
Everything has its own crazy.

1085
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:01,620
Hang on,
hang on,

1086
00:45:01,621 --> 00:45:03,410
let me look over there.
What's math?

1087
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:07,560
I want to say where this cliff cool.
I mean everything has its own crazy.

1088
00:45:07,561 --> 00:45:09,700
But think those,
uh,

1089
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:13,500
pain pills from just the experiences of 
people that I've talked to,

1090
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:17,460
not firsthand stuff obviously,
but they seem to grip you so hard.

1091
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:21,420
People just can't shake them.
A lot of fighters,

1092
00:45:21,421 --> 00:45:23,040
man,
a lot of fighters get hurt,

1093
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:29,600
have surgery from all the and then take 
a few pain pills and then all of a 

1094
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:30,680
sudden they got a problem.
You know,

1095
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:35,780
especially if you're a person who maybe 
had a problem in the past and he took a 

1096
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:39,660
break and you were clean and sober,
living the mma life and then suddenly,

1097
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:44,710
yeah,
and then you hurt your back or 

1098
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:44,710
something.
He needed the painkillers.

1099
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:44,710
It just took them.
Don't worry,

1100
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:45,400
I'll get off of them.
I mean there's,

1101
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:46,290
it's just,
you're,

1102
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:51,120
you're challenging people with these 
things in a way that I don't necessarily

1103
00:45:51,121 --> 00:45:56,121
know if it's fair.
You're challenging them with chemical 

1104
00:45:56,121 --> 00:45:56,910
addictions to trust for it yourself.
You handle yourself.

1105
00:45:58,010 --> 00:45:58,500
It's,
I mean,

1106
00:45:58,501 --> 00:46:01,140
I definitely think you should have the 
right to do whatever you want,

1107
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:06,350
but I'm thinking like,
because it messes with your brain 

1108
00:46:06,350 --> 00:46:06,350
chemistry though.

1109
00:46:06,350 --> 00:46:06,720
It's like asking a drunk person.
Are you okay to drive?

1110
00:46:06,810 --> 00:46:08,580
And it's like they have the worst 
judgment right now.

1111
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:09,570
Yeah.
We'll ask them.

1112
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:15,290
You're taking someone and putting him on
a chemical fucking addiction to 

1113
00:46:15,290 --> 00:46:15,290
something and then say like,
yeah,

1114
00:46:15,290 --> 00:46:16,710
but use your regular mind.
Yeah.

1115
00:46:16,711 --> 00:46:19,410
You're putting them on a crazy cocktail.
You're saying,

1116
00:46:19,411 --> 00:46:20,580
Oh,
you got pain here.

1117
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:25,610
Have some opiates all day and you're 
just going to be like in a heroin fog 

1118
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:29,610
and then maybe you'll get.
You'll settle into that heroin fog.

1119
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:32,580
I know a dude has got a fucked up back 
and I know when he's on.

1120
00:46:32,850 --> 00:46:33,660
Really?
Oh yeah,

1121
00:46:33,661 --> 00:46:34,420
man.
I talked to him.

1122
00:46:34,421 --> 00:46:36,660
It's just whole weirded out because we 
will take a selfie.

1123
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:42,400
I'm.
This is not a good place to take a 

1124
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:42,400
selfie.
Sat over there.

1125
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:42,400
Why not?
Okay.

1126
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,020
By that wall come up.

1127
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:45,140
I believe you

1128
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:59,190
to this gorgeous out here.
I don't want to get these feats slippery

1129
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:00,880
because I got this weight on my back.
Oh yeah.

1130
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:03,720
Oh,
here we go.

1131
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:05,640
Alright.
Delayed.

1132
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:06,200
Yeah.
Yeah,

1133
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:07,020
sure.
No,

1134
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:09,530
I don't have no phone capable of taking 
this picture.

1135
00:47:14,990 --> 00:47:15,740
That is,
by the way,

1136
00:47:15,741 --> 00:47:17,360
anyone thinking about getting a flip 
phone?

1137
00:47:17,990 --> 00:47:19,760
Everyone has a camera.
If you guys.

1138
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,530
They were want to be with that one.
Yeah,

1139
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:28,980
that's true.
Yeah.

1140
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:36,250
I like that white Bush thing on the side
of the mountain.

1141
00:47:39,450 --> 00:47:40,390
The white Bush.
Yeah.

1142
00:47:40,391 --> 00:47:41,830
The thing I think coming out.
Yeah.

1143
00:47:41,831 --> 00:47:42,970
What is that?
I don't know.

1144
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,100
La Sex.
Some avatar shit.

1145
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:46,420
Yeah.
Real life.

1146
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:49,660
It's so weird when you look at plant 
life and the variety we get,

1147
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:53,020
we just get really used to it,
but if it didn't exist,

1148
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:58,500
it's like the whole world was the desert
sand dunes and you got to see something 

1149
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:03,301
like this.
You'd be stunned by the amount of 

1150
00:48:03,301 --> 00:48:03,820
radiant energy it gives.
You know,

1151
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:09,680
if you,
if the whole world is a desert and all 

1152
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:09,680
of a sudden they brought you into like a
creek like this,

1153
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,710
like he'd be like,
Holy Shit.

1154
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:13,450
Can I touch it?
Oh my God.

1155
00:48:13,451 --> 00:48:15,590
It's alive around me.
These plants,

1156
00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:19,180
their life force,
their saying hi.

1157
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:24,610
The forest says hi to some of us are not
that good at listening,

1158
00:48:24,611 --> 00:48:25,300
man.

1159
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:29,800
I tried to give as many orthodox Jewish 
friend to do mushrooms and he was like,

1160
00:48:29,801 --> 00:48:31,150
I don't think God wants me to do that.
I'm like,

1161
00:48:31,151 --> 00:48:31,840
no,
you're wrong.

1162
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:35,050
That's fucking telephone that God left 
for you to talk to him.

1163
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:36,610
That's a good way of putting it.
I kept saying,

1164
00:48:36,611 --> 00:48:37,990
you got to pick it up.
Why else would he put it here?

1165
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:39,570
That's a good way of putting.
It wasn't manmade.

1166
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:42,010
Dude.
That's actually a very strong argument.

1167
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:45,280
Oh God made it stupid thing on the other
side of the glass.

1168
00:48:45,281 --> 00:48:46,930
I'm fucking.
When you're bitten someone in prison.

1169
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:48,090
Yep.
Pick up the phone.

1170
00:48:48,110 --> 00:48:49,330
Talk,
pick up the phone.

1171
00:48:51,930 --> 00:48:53,830
You might be right,
dude.

1172
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:56,530
Write that down.
Somebody texted it to you.

1173
00:48:57,030 --> 00:48:59,230
No.
For real though,

1174
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:04,890
right?
They're the only people that disagree 

1175
00:49:04,890 --> 00:49:06,250
with that or people that don't do 
mushrooms or haven't done it.

1176
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:09,130
Yeah.
So Neil said that he took them.

1177
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:12,820
We did them in banff last year and he 
said he loves to go to Amsterdam,

1178
00:49:12,821 --> 00:49:15,970
and he took like,
I think like 10 grams,

1179
00:49:16,930 --> 00:49:19,780
10 grams or something like that.
That's way too much.

1180
00:49:19,810 --> 00:49:21,250
And then he was like,
I didn't like it was too much for me.

1181
00:49:21,251 --> 00:49:22,960
I'm like,
I know no one should do that much.

1182
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:25,780
Well,
whatever.

1183
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:28,240
Not the real people,
but like nobody knew.

1184
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:33,900
Right.
I bet those crazy psycho night type 

1185
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:37,320
characters.
I can't handle 10 grounds to three 

1186
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:38,370
eighths.
Yeah,

1187
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:41,620
that's a lot for almost a quarter.
Three quarters of a quarter.

1188
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:42,570
Is that.
Yep.

1189
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:50,470
You did ask him.
He never talked about that.

1190
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:54,820
Did what?
What'd you think about that?

1191
00:49:55,210 --> 00:49:56,590
Very interesting.
How different,

1192
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:57,790
how different,
how same.

1193
00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:00,260
It's very different.
It's um,

1194
00:50:01,330 --> 00:50:03,230
I didn't take a large dose.
Yeah.

1195
00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:08,260
I took enough to enjoy it was really.
What does that mean in real terms?

1196
00:50:08,450 --> 00:50:10,210
What a tab or something or drop or 
something.

1197
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:13,640
I don't know,
a piece of an altoid I'm not.

1198
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:17,790
It was in a candy form,
but um,

1199
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:23,640
what I got out of it was that all of 
these things,

1200
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:27,380
whether it's is a great time to talk 
about this when we're on the full,

1201
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:34,010
all of these things are somehow related 
with things.

1202
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:36,830
All of these psychedelics,
even pot,

1203
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:42,020
even edible pod mushrooms,
Lsd,

1204
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:47,500
all of them are taking to you like 
separate apartment rooms in God's 

1205
00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:53,150
gigantic apartment building.
They'll take you to different places.

1206
00:50:53,930 --> 00:50:56,780
Like dmd takes you to a different room.

1207
00:50:57,530 --> 00:51:00,050
Mushrooms have a different party show 
you,

1208
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:02,570
but it's all in the same,
same realm.

1209
00:51:02,571 --> 00:51:04,910
Somewhere go somewhere,
come on in this house with my.

1210
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,750
It's not here.
You know,

1211
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:13,630
and acid is definitely almost like what 
acid makes you feel like is that it 

1212
00:51:14,091 --> 00:51:18,170
wants to sort of change what here is,
you know what I mean?

1213
00:51:19,170 --> 00:51:20,300
It was like,
what did you say?

1214
00:51:20,301 --> 00:51:25,301
I know I think I have a pretty objective
view of how I see reality.

1215
00:51:26,510 --> 00:51:27,620
And then acid goes,
bitch,

1216
00:51:27,621 --> 00:51:29,450
you don't know shit because it's not 
that.

1217
00:51:29,451 --> 00:51:34,451
There's something else.
We could change it to something totally 

1218
00:51:34,451 --> 00:51:36,410
different forever and you'll be.
I know what happens.

1219
00:51:36,411 --> 00:51:38,900
It gets this place of,
I guess from fusses over,

1220
00:51:38,901 --> 00:51:40,640
so you missed it,
but still catch up.

1221
00:51:41,470 --> 00:51:42,500
Go Pretty.
This is,

1222
00:51:45,830 --> 00:51:47,290
but I've gotten to the place where it's 
like,

1223
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:50,330
like you see the truth a lot on 
mushrooms.

1224
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:52,700
Acid is a little different.
Yeah.

1225
00:51:52,730 --> 00:51:53,400
Well,
you know,

1226
00:51:54,610 --> 00:51:57,210
I felt like it was pretty introspective.
Yeah.

1227
00:51:57,380 --> 00:52:00,020
But it was also calming and an 
interesting way,

1228
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,720
like per perspective enhancing,
calming,

1229
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:09,280
you know,
I think that where you're like 

1230
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:09,280
everything's gonna be okay.
Yeah.

1231
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:13,690
But you see it since it was the first 
time I did probably go into that with 

1232
00:52:13,690 --> 00:52:17,201
some preconceived notions.
You never know because I'm Larry Hagman 

1233
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:21,200
with some notions from bell.
Let's think I did.

1234
00:52:21,201 --> 00:52:25,100
Yeah.
Larry Hagman from Dallas before he died.

1235
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:30,400
Really just doing all these interviews 
and he was talking about like important 

1236
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:31,070
lessons in his life.
I forget what the context was,

1237
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:36,400
but he said that he took Lsd,
really Larry Hagman and that Lsd took 

1238
00:52:37,221 --> 00:52:40,660
away his fear of dying and I,
I'll never forget that.

1239
00:52:40,661 --> 00:52:45,661
Like he looks so peaceful when he said 
that to the lady who was interviewing 

1240
00:52:45,661 --> 00:52:46,640
him.
I think it was a lady that's bold,

1241
00:52:46,641 --> 00:52:48,260
he's a fucking networker.
I've not even been a lady,

1242
00:52:48,261 --> 00:52:50,180
might have been a dude and I've turned 
them into the lady.

1243
00:52:51,370 --> 00:52:55,820
Why draw your own conclusions?
But uh,

1244
00:52:56,330 --> 00:53:01,330
I think his,
his statements on it about it made him 

1245
00:53:01,330 --> 00:53:05,711
not afraid of death and appreciating 
like what life is and how life keeps 

1246
00:53:06,951 --> 00:53:07,430
moving.

1247
00:53:10,210 --> 00:53:12,050
Making any sort of efforts to make that 
legal.

1248
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:17,500
I don't think so.
I think you've got to tread carefully 

1249
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:18,110
with all this stuff because you get one 
of these jeff sessions types,

1250
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:23,111
characters kits in an office and starts 
Muslim buckling down on muscle and the 

1251
00:53:24,591 --> 00:53:25,380
laws around,

1252
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:29,520
they don't want state rights to take 
place.

1253
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:34,470
You know the elephant.
Elephant Rock in front of a lion.

1254
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:39,590
Right over here.
Let's try to look like an elephant 

1255
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:40,970
standing in front of a lion.
That rock formation rock,

1256
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:43,230
the one that looks like a nose and then 
down from down from there,

1257
00:53:43,290 --> 00:53:48,290
it looks like an elephant.
Whereas the elephant thing with the 

1258
00:53:48,290 --> 00:53:48,960
trunk.
Oh,

1259
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:50,950
you don't see it?
Wait.

1260
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:52,030
Yeah.
No,

1261
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:55,590
I do see that trunk there and the like,
sheer something else shuts out.

1262
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:55,920
Yeah,
yeah,

1263
00:53:55,921 --> 00:53:56,860
yeah,
yes.

1264
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,620
And where's the lion?
But right behind,

1265
00:53:58,621 --> 00:54:00,120
right behind it about to eat it.
Okay.

1266
00:54:00,121 --> 00:54:00,960
Okay.
Okay.

1267
00:54:00,961 --> 00:54:02,010
Okay.
So what I'm saying,

1268
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:07,100
yeah,
it almost looks like somebody carved 

1269
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:07,100
that shit.
It seems to me like a rabbit,

1270
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:10,380
so I'm sure,
but it's still,

1271
00:54:10,381 --> 00:54:13,230
no matter what it definitely attacking 
the elephant or next to him.

1272
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:15,090
Yeah,
something's going on.

1273
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:17,800
Yeah,
I just thought that.

1274
00:54:18,210 --> 00:54:20,340
What in God's name were we just talking 
about?

1275
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:24,150
We are so high right now,
vampire movies now.

1276
00:54:24,151 --> 00:54:27,970
We did that a long time ago.
That Hawk too.

1277
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:29,430
Did you grow up with any sort of 
wilderness?

1278
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:30,490
Yeah,
a little bit.

1279
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:31,570
Hiking and stuff like that.
It was.

1280
00:54:31,670 --> 00:54:36,300
Well when I lived in Newton.
Newton is like a suburb of Boston.

1281
00:54:36,330 --> 00:54:41,330
Yeah,
that's where I went to high school and 

1282
00:54:41,330 --> 00:54:41,330
there was a lot of woods right across 
the street from my house.

1283
00:54:41,330 --> 00:54:43,230
The Charles River was right across the 
street from my house,

1284
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:48,710
so when I was in high school,
me and my friends would go out in the 

1285
00:54:48,710 --> 00:54:52,101
woods is right there.
It's like a river and some woods and it 

1286
00:54:52,101 --> 00:54:52,710
went back pretty far.
We would just always go in there,

1287
00:54:52,711 --> 00:54:57,711
we'd go fishing and go fucking around in
the woods and really arts and Shit,

1288
00:54:59,280 --> 00:54:59,700
you know?

1289
00:55:00,170 --> 00:55:02,800
And then just be out alone yelling and 
screaming.

1290
00:55:02,830 --> 00:55:03,870
Nobody's around you.
Yeah,

1291
00:55:03,871 --> 00:55:06,940
we did a lot of stupid shit.
Everybody's fine.

1292
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:08,490
Yeah.
But it's um,

1293
00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:13,730
there was a little bit of woods like 
right outside my house and it was by no 

1294
00:55:13,730 --> 00:55:14,340
means rural.
It's a suburb,

1295
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:16,650
but in the suburbs,
like around Boston,

1296
00:55:16,651 --> 00:55:19,050
like you get these areas that are just 
big patches of woods,

1297
00:55:19,830 --> 00:55:22,580
just haven't done anything to it.
Well,

1298
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:25,690
their forests or like different man a 
lot around my place grows.

1299
00:55:25,691 --> 00:55:27,000
They're really.
Well let's.

1300
00:55:27,050 --> 00:55:28,500
It rains.
Yeah.

1301
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:30,630
The woods in Maine or something like 
that.

1302
00:55:30,631 --> 00:55:35,520
That's the fucking woods man.
I mean it's thick timber man.

1303
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:38,180
Like when you drive it up,
use the highways.

1304
00:55:38,181 --> 00:55:43,181
Like both sides.
Just green on both sides but can't see 

1305
00:55:43,181 --> 00:55:43,181
anything.
Woods,

1306
00:55:43,181 --> 00:55:46,160
woods do this.
There's a road that you take where you 

1307
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:47,400
were going to wear a Stephen King lived.

1308
00:55:47,790 --> 00:55:49,740
Oh fuck.
Did he live Salem?

1309
00:55:49,741 --> 00:55:50,550
No.
Dammit.

1310
00:55:51,270 --> 00:55:51,930
Portland,
Maine.

1311
00:55:51,931 --> 00:55:53,400
But I can't remember the name.
No,

1312
00:55:53,401 --> 00:55:55,290
he didn't live in Portland.
God dammit,

1313
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:56,670
I'm so.
It was Maine though,

1314
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:57,900
right?
I'll come back to it.

1315
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:00,750
Yeah.
Shit was a portland,

1316
00:56:00,751 --> 00:56:01,390
Maine.
No,

1317
00:56:01,890 --> 00:56:06,890
God dammit.
Main people are going to be so mad as 

1318
00:56:07,470 --> 00:56:08,500
Maine.
People love me.

1319
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:12,720
You know that mandatory.
What we a main people,

1320
00:56:12,721 --> 00:56:15,270
they love Maine.
They love made to call them maniacs.

1321
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:16,110
Oh really?
Yeah.

1322
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:21,560
They loved Maine.
Talk Shit about me and I'll try to kill 

1323
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:23,841
you.
He used to go up there and talk shit 

1324
00:56:23,841 --> 00:56:23,841
about me and they will fucking get up 
and yell at.

1325
00:56:23,841 --> 00:56:28,771
You really can't even joke around.
I love that joke around about.

1326
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:34,120
It gets so mad.
Well,

1327
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:37,090
do you think where you're from?
Yeah.

1328
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:38,800
From sucks.
Yeah.

1329
00:56:38,970 --> 00:56:43,970
All right.
We're like barely establishing 

1330
00:56:43,970 --> 00:56:47,040
tribalism.
Tribes have states that are competing 

1331
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,620
with other states still.
You know,

1332
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:50,430
we should probably break off,
right?

1333
00:56:51,370 --> 00:56:53,680
Some states have break off.
They're doing it in Europe.

1334
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:57,040
They kind of like,
why are we still together?

1335
00:56:57,041 --> 00:56:58,810
Let's just get out of here.
You guys go on your way.

1336
00:56:58,811 --> 00:57:00,700
We'll go on ours.
It's all too confusing,

1337
00:57:00,701 --> 00:57:03,400
man.
Like I don't understand the military.

1338
00:57:03,430 --> 00:57:06,190
You could have like open border 
crossings between the mall or something.

1339
00:57:06,670 --> 00:57:08,200
Yeah,
but I don't understand how.

1340
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:10,870
How would that work if people just.
If we pulled the military,

1341
00:57:10,871 --> 00:57:15,871
is the military the military work 
because then we getting invaded too 

1342
00:57:15,871 --> 00:57:15,871
fast?
Well,

1343
00:57:15,871 --> 00:57:16,030
I don't think so because we still have 
the same amount of people.

1344
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:18,910
It's still the same.
Like the military becomes weak.

1345
00:57:19,010 --> 00:57:24,010
Yeah.
You have to figure out like how does it 

1346
00:57:24,010 --> 00:57:25,261
get paid and how does it make sure that 
it's just protecting us and not under 

1347
00:57:25,261 --> 00:57:29,371
the will of anybody that has some 
various intentions now that there's no 

1348
00:57:29,371 --> 00:57:31,240
states are now.
There's no power.

1349
00:57:31,330 --> 00:57:34,630
There's no power.
You don't want to be like the country of

1350
00:57:34,631 --> 00:57:39,631
California man.
I guess maybe when it was back to where 

1351
00:57:39,631 --> 00:57:39,631
it was in the beginning were the states 
really felt like,

1352
00:57:39,631 --> 00:57:41,260
no,
I'm a Virginia and then in America,

1353
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:42,340
well let's just be real.
Right?

1354
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:47,400
States are bullshit.
It's the same reason why countries are 

1355
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:48,100
bullshit so far to high or smart parts 
of Kentucky.

1356
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:51,960
What happened in World War One and what 
happened in World War Two states invaded

1357
00:57:51,970 --> 00:57:53,200
states.
It's the same thing.

1358
00:57:53,390 --> 00:57:56,020
It's like us being invaded by Nevada.
It's the same thing.

1359
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:57,670
We would lose,
right.

1360
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:00,400
It would probably have a lot of guns 
were with people here.

1361
00:58:00,930 --> 00:58:04,240
You really think about that.
That's exactly what it's like if Germany

1362
00:58:04,241 --> 00:58:05,910
invades Poland.
Right?

1363
00:58:05,911 --> 00:58:06,330
Right.
Right.

1364
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:07,960
Now they're both in the EU.
Yeah.

1365
00:58:07,961 --> 00:58:09,610
I mean both.
Just like right next to each other.

1366
00:58:09,850 --> 00:58:13,660
How far away is Germany to Poland?
Um,

1367
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:15,970
how long does it take to drive Germany 
to Poland?

1368
00:58:16,090 --> 00:58:19,810
If you had to guess drive inside a day.
Inside a day.

1369
00:58:19,811 --> 00:58:20,970
Product that.
Yeah.

1370
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:24,550
Yeah.
I bet about that day war with Colorado.

1371
00:58:24,570 --> 00:58:26,740
Vancouver to Colorado in a day.
If you had to,

1372
00:58:27,210 --> 00:58:29,450
if you took adderall,
you couldn't get to.

1373
00:58:29,690 --> 00:58:32,800
You couldn't get to Montana from there.
From here in a day.

1374
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:34,540
I don't know.
I don't know.

1375
00:58:34,570 --> 00:58:37,630
We did Vancouver to La took us like 27 
hours.

1376
00:58:37,631 --> 00:58:38,980
We have three people.
We just kept switching,

1377
00:58:39,370 --> 00:58:42,670
only stopped for gas and it took like 
27.

1378
00:58:43,150 --> 00:58:45,580
So move that line like over some and 
then where's that?

1379
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:48,270
Wow.
Yeah.

1380
00:58:48,271 --> 00:58:53,271
I think if you could just stay awake,
you can go pretty far for people 

1381
00:58:53,441 --> 00:58:55,600
splitting it in a day.
Yeah.

1382
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:57,640
If you could just stay awake.
You go pretty far in a day,

1383
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:01,990
but the point is that's the people that 
we'd be at war with fucking bananas.

1384
00:59:02,470 --> 00:59:05,320
That's what these people went to war 
with other states.

1385
00:59:05,410 --> 00:59:07,420
Let's don't call it a state.
Don't call it a country.

1386
00:59:07,421 --> 00:59:10,120
It's just people on that side went to 
war with people on that side.

1387
00:59:10,121 --> 00:59:11,940
There was as close as Nevada.

1388
00:59:14,310 --> 00:59:18,280
Nevada is only four hours away driving,
but it's close as Colorado at least.

1389
00:59:18,390 --> 00:59:22,200
Aren't you going to war with Colorado?
We might win

1390
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:22,750
the.
No,

1391
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:23,070
no,
no.

1392
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:26,250
Do People at bail?
People just start swimming?

1393
00:59:26,610 --> 00:59:27,890
They're jumping in the water.
Yeah.

1394
00:59:27,990 --> 00:59:29,400
Yeah.
They've got the disposable cash.

1395
00:59:29,690 --> 00:59:33,110
Let's go to England to many people just 
get out of there.

1396
00:59:33,370 --> 00:59:35,580
Just watch from mature.
Yeah,

1397
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:37,800
watch it lightened flames from the 
shore.

1398
00:59:37,890 --> 00:59:39,210
Oh,
what's a good revolution this time?

1399
00:59:41,190 --> 00:59:44,100
It's pretty one.
How do you think we would survive a real

1400
00:59:44,130 --> 00:59:49,130
revolution?
Like if something fucking bananas 

1401
00:59:49,130 --> 00:59:49,130
happened?

1402
00:59:49,130 --> 00:59:49,130
Well,

1403
00:59:50,590 --> 00:59:55,590
you got to think they'll kill all the 
dissidents as fast as they can and run 

1404
00:59:55,590 --> 00:59:59,410
with like a voice and then shut down the
internet or at least shut down the 

1405
01:00:00,501 --> 01:00:01,670
Internet.
Yeah.

1406
01:00:01,710 --> 01:00:03,410
They'd have to establish their own 
internet,

1407
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:04,220
right?
Yeah.

1408
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:05,240
Yeah.
So they could use it

1409
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:07,170
and then um,

1410
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:09,920
that would be so evil.
Yeah.

1411
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:12,020
It's so like a vendor,
but you'd be like,

1412
01:00:12,021 --> 01:00:13,040
find them in line.
I'm in line,

1413
01:00:13,041 --> 01:00:13,970
I'll do it.
What do you want?

1414
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:14,630
Well,
I'll do it.

1415
01:00:14,660 --> 01:00:15,040
And it's like,
well,

1416
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:15,950
it's on the Internet.
Back on,

1417
01:00:15,951 --> 01:00:16,810
please let me,
I'll,

1418
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:19,130
I'll,
I'll find you when we surrender,

1419
01:00:19,131 --> 01:00:21,500
can we get back our stuff?
And they'd be like,

1420
01:00:21,501 --> 01:00:23,450
I don't know if we can trust you guys.
Yeah.

1421
01:00:23,451 --> 01:00:24,890
You guys are already broke from the 
team.

1422
01:00:25,090 --> 01:00:30,090
Yeah.
We're team players over here ready to 

1423
01:00:30,090 --> 01:00:30,090
keep moving and then you get some 
revolutionary is like,

1424
01:00:30,090 --> 01:00:30,710
I need you.
And he was like,

1425
01:00:30,711 --> 01:00:32,510
come on man,
I'm not fucking strong like that.

1426
01:00:32,570 --> 01:00:36,650
Get somebody else like in our homeland.

1427
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:41,580
Remember that I only watched it until 
they hung that dude.

1428
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:42,300
What?
Dude?

1429
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:43,740
The redhead.
Homeland?

1430
01:00:43,741 --> 01:00:44,400
Yeah.
Oh,

1431
01:00:44,401 --> 01:00:45,840
well after they hung up,
I'm like,

1432
01:00:45,870 --> 01:00:46,500
I'm out.
Yo,

1433
01:00:46,530 --> 01:00:47,490
I watched before that.
Oh,

1434
01:00:47,491 --> 01:00:48,630
that should have been the end of it for 
sure.

1435
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:49,950
Yeah.
He was the whole show.

1436
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:51,690
Yeah,
that's who it's bad ass.

1437
01:00:51,750 --> 01:00:53,460
Yeah.
How do you kill that guy?

1438
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:55,080
That's ridiculous.
How do you kill them?

1439
01:00:55,390 --> 01:00:57,100
Why did you kill that guy?
Contract dispute?

1440
01:00:57,130 --> 01:00:58,980
Probably.
It had to be.

1441
01:00:59,070 --> 01:01:00,070
Yeah.
Why would he leave it?

1442
01:01:00,071 --> 01:01:01,980
Unless you don't want to do this 
anymore.

1443
01:01:01,981 --> 01:01:03,750
And they will be like,
all right,

1444
01:01:03,751 --> 01:01:05,750
we'll just end it.
They went on after that.

1445
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:06,900
Yup.
What's that dude?

1446
01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:09,270
But that's just the money growth.
Bangor Maine,

1447
01:01:09,510 --> 01:01:10,350
Bangor,
Maine,

1448
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:15,160
Bangor smoke.
Way Too much pot for this podcast.

1449
01:01:15,220 --> 01:01:17,370
I believe it was the right amount.
What?

1450
01:01:17,371 --> 01:01:21,960
Uh,
so how was it different than mushrooms?

1451
01:01:22,530 --> 01:01:22,920
Acid.

1452
01:01:22,950 --> 01:01:24,090
How long did it last?
Let's say that.

1453
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:27,510
What'd you do it.
I just took it at the studio.

1454
01:01:28,090 --> 01:01:32,760
Oh,
do you want it around outside?

1455
01:01:32,761 --> 01:01:34,010
A little bit.
Yeah.

1456
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:35,300
Okay.
Hold on.

1457
01:01:35,301 --> 01:01:40,301
The inside.
So maybe I didn't take enough to have 

1458
01:01:40,301 --> 01:01:43,340
like a super profound acid experience,
you know,

1459
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:45,960
but I've taken it a couple times to stay
up way late.

1460
01:01:45,961 --> 01:01:50,961
And the same dosage says no.
Well I took him in Edinburgh last time 

1461
01:01:52,471 --> 01:01:56,160
and it was like me to stay until the sun
came up and then 10:00

1462
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:57,870
AM not even like just when the sun came 
up,

1463
01:01:58,450 --> 01:01:59,850
I'd be like,
just kept walking and walking.

1464
01:01:59,851 --> 01:02:03,840
But I found hills like this.
So I wasn't looking to go to sleep.

1465
01:02:03,841 --> 01:02:05,490
I was just thinking about you and you 
just keep thinking though,

1466
01:02:05,491 --> 01:02:06,460
right?
Yeah.

1467
01:02:08,450 --> 01:02:11,430
Doesn't,
doesn't like edible part.

1468
01:02:11,431 --> 01:02:16,431
Do that too,
to just get you thinking in a pretty 

1469
01:02:16,431 --> 01:02:17,450
profound way to.
I think with those edibles,

1470
01:02:17,510 --> 01:02:20,430
that word in casual conversation sound 
profound.

1471
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:22,470
You're just not using it for burgers and
stuff.

1472
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:25,350
Said chances.
Ground beef.

1473
01:02:27,870 --> 01:02:31,550
It's just such a douchebag phrase.
Who?

1474
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:34,590
Ropes of Shit.
And ropes ropes the ropes.

1475
01:02:34,890 --> 01:02:35,160
That's true.

1476
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:38,330
So anyway.
Yeah.

1477
01:02:38,390 --> 01:02:41,450
Watch my special offer hardship.
Fear a double negative.

1478
01:02:42,070 --> 01:02:44,390
If you're like to tell five friends,
welcome.

1479
01:02:44,391 --> 01:02:47,410
10 dead flakes.
So it was good for you,

1480
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:50,390
Huh?
Shit.

1481
01:02:51,220 --> 01:02:52,940
Yeah.
It's all the countries I went to.

1482
01:02:52,941 --> 01:02:54,380
They can see my special.
Yeah.

1483
01:02:54,381 --> 01:02:57,500
Netflix can put something on.
You can watch it at anytime.

1484
01:02:57,860 --> 01:02:59,240
Anyplace you have an internet 
connection.

1485
01:03:00,530 --> 01:03:02,360
A real one.
You can't do it on a plane yet,

1486
01:03:03,020 --> 01:03:03,690
right?
You can watch.

1487
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:05,090
You load it up.
Can you load it up?

1488
01:03:05,270 --> 01:03:07,430
Some of them they have in the seats.
Oh yeah.

1489
01:03:07,460 --> 01:03:08,630
Heading on the airplanes.
We've been.

1490
01:03:08,631 --> 01:03:10,070
How does Netflix work and you load it up
on your.

1491
01:03:10,071 --> 01:03:12,110
Like on your phone beforehand or.
No,

1492
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:13,110
it's always.
No,

1493
01:03:13,150 --> 01:03:14,570
you can only stream it.
Okay.

1494
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:21,090
But I guess that's what solves the 
piracy qualms sort of,

1495
01:03:21,450 --> 01:03:25,050
but I'm sure people can pull it off of 
Netflix and streaming.

1496
01:03:25,810 --> 01:03:27,030
I mean a positive,
right?

1497
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:28,320
Yeah.
Anyway.

1498
01:03:28,321 --> 01:03:29,460
Whatever.
Regardless of that.

1499
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:32,260
Yeah.
It's still pretty accessible.

1500
01:03:32,550 --> 01:03:33,840
Yeah,
it's super accessible.

1501
01:03:34,170 --> 01:03:39,170
The point is it's just an awesome 
platform and they have so much standup 

1502
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:42,030
there now.
It's the spot to be.

1503
01:03:42,060 --> 01:03:45,270
They really do have a lot of standup.
It's pretty great.

1504
01:03:46,830 --> 01:03:48,630
Yeah.
It's like the place to go for it.

1505
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:49,620
Yeah.
It's pretty big.

1506
01:03:49,621 --> 01:03:52,050
And find what you want.
There's so many different choices too.

1507
01:03:52,051 --> 01:03:56,490
And you also can stumble into people who
began to stumble.

1508
01:03:56,730 --> 01:04:01,730
Yeah.
Kind of like when rolling stone put it 

1509
01:04:01,730 --> 01:04:01,730
at the top five albums of the week,
you know,

1510
01:04:01,730 --> 01:04:01,730
and if you saw it,
you're like,

1511
01:04:01,730 --> 01:04:02,700
that's a good review.
I'll get that.

1512
01:04:02,820 --> 01:04:04,120
Yeah.
You know,

1513
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:06,300
just like I've always heard about that 
guy.

1514
01:04:06,301 --> 01:04:07,220
Let me give him,
let me give it a look.

1515
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:08,760
No,

1516
01:04:10,890 --> 01:04:13,750
what's a good one you've seen lately?
I can't wait for Roy's.

1517
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:17,100
That Scoville it's out in a month ago 
without now.

1518
01:04:17,130 --> 01:04:19,680
It's out now.
I know it's always just out now.

1519
01:04:20,270 --> 01:04:22,050
Um,
yeah.

1520
01:04:22,051 --> 01:04:24,270
He's just always really funny.
Really,

1521
01:04:24,530 --> 01:04:29,530
really out there.
I haven't seen it but he's so weird and 

1522
01:04:29,530 --> 01:04:30,030
different but like not weird.
Weird.

1523
01:04:30,031 --> 01:04:31,760
Just like,
I don't know.

1524
01:04:31,830 --> 01:04:34,270
I know you got to see it.
It's just always try and crazy shit.

1525
01:04:34,271 --> 01:04:39,271
I think I might've might've saw him in 
la somewhere once he did this thing with

1526
01:04:40,861 --> 01:04:42,960
John doerr where they,
um,

1527
01:04:43,790 --> 01:04:48,420
first time I saw it was in Montreal.
I'm hosting that show right now.

1528
01:04:50,650 --> 01:04:52,770
Big J and Jimmy Carr.
Okay.

1529
01:04:52,780 --> 01:04:54,990
How do I.
was a man.

1530
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:56,760
Get me there.
I have no idea.

1531
01:04:56,790 --> 01:05:01,790
Damn.
It's lost in old world of marijuana 

1532
01:05:01,790 --> 01:05:05,840
frequency into.
Damn it.

1533
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:07,590
Take a break,
collect your thoughts.

1534
01:05:07,850 --> 01:05:12,850
Okay.
It was talking about something that's 

1535
01:05:12,850 --> 01:05:16,890
definitely talking about something in 
Montreal at a something we December to 

1536
01:05:19,511 --> 01:05:20,360
find new people.
Got It,

1537
01:05:20,390 --> 01:05:23,570
got it.
So I'm going to show small place and I'm

1538
01:05:23,770 --> 01:05:25,750
reggie watts is hosting.
It was just like eight,

1539
01:05:25,780 --> 01:05:27,940
nine years ago.
He was big but not like massive.

1540
01:05:27,941 --> 01:05:30,880
And it was fun and a lot to people and 
say,

1541
01:05:30,881 --> 01:05:31,330
Hey,
by the way,

1542
01:05:31,331 --> 01:05:32,470
everybody,
good host hosts.

1543
01:05:32,490 --> 01:05:33,850
Just weird stuff.
Like does it?

1544
01:05:33,851 --> 01:05:34,600
Well,
he goes by the way,

1545
01:05:34,601 --> 01:05:35,440
uh,
we had a couple,

1546
01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:37,810
we had a comic dropout.
So,

1547
01:05:37,811 --> 01:05:39,280
uh,
hope you guys don't mind.

1548
01:05:39,281 --> 01:05:40,750
Everyone's doing little lecture time and
everyone's like,

1549
01:05:40,751 --> 01:05:41,680
yeah,
fucking sweet.

1550
01:05:42,310 --> 01:05:43,030
And then,
um,

1551
01:05:43,260 --> 01:05:45,010
he goes through the show a little bit 
and then it goes,

1552
01:05:45,011 --> 01:05:45,370
okay.

1553
01:05:45,370 --> 01:05:47,590
So here's the problem,
like everyone ended up showing up.

1554
01:05:47,591 --> 01:05:51,250
So now we're behind.
So we actually have to be at is festival

1555
01:05:51,251 --> 01:05:56,251
rules.
So the last two comments agree just to 

1556
01:05:56,251 --> 01:05:56,251
go on together.
Is that cool with everybody?

1557
01:05:56,251 --> 01:05:56,260
And then they do,
right?

1558
01:05:56,261 --> 01:06:01,261
Everyone claps and then they both just 
start doing their own bits over each 

1559
01:06:01,261 --> 01:06:02,410
other.
Just like talking to me,

1560
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:03,760
they're not going to go back to back it 
all.

1561
01:06:03,790 --> 01:06:06,010
They're both just doing their own X.
Oh no.

1562
01:06:06,130 --> 01:06:07,180
Yeah,
and I'm telling you,

1563
01:06:07,181 --> 01:06:12,181
man,
it should've been funny for 30 seconds 

1564
01:06:12,181 --> 01:06:12,181
and nine and a half minutes later I'm 
dying laughing.

1565
01:06:13,030 --> 01:06:14,760
It was so fucking good.
Yeah.

1566
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:19,880
And then sometimes one week go to get 
his breath and you just hear not my 

1567
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:19,880
light bulb,
you know,

1568
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:20,560
from the other way.
And then it would go like that.

1569
01:06:20,561 --> 01:06:25,561
And it was like sometimes some point you
hear like you guys like impressions and 

1570
01:06:25,561 --> 01:06:25,561
it was like,
yeah,

1571
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:26,770
it was so good.

1572
01:06:26,890 --> 01:06:28,090
Wow,
that's amazing.

1573
01:06:28,570 --> 01:06:33,570
That's what I was thinking.
I was thinking that's going to be 

1574
01:06:33,570 --> 01:06:33,570
terrible.
Oh No.

1575
01:06:33,570 --> 01:06:33,570
Yeah,
I know,

1576
01:06:33,570 --> 01:06:33,570
right.
Didn't.

1577
01:06:33,570 --> 01:06:34,610
They didn't plan it?
No.

1578
01:06:34,630 --> 01:06:35,260
No.
They planned it.

1579
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:36,110
They did play.
Yeah.

1580
01:06:36,111 --> 01:06:37,210
Yeah.
Like how far in advance?

1581
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:40,620
I guess they had done it a bunch,
but register said luck real well.

1582
01:06:40,990 --> 01:06:42,310
Oh,
that's brilliant.

1583
01:06:42,311 --> 01:06:43,330
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

1584
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:44,420
No,
they didn't just start talking.

1585
01:06:44,450 --> 01:06:48,110
Refused to give him imagine.
He'll be amazing if they like.

1586
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:49,830
Yeah,
it was.

1587
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:52,990
Neither one of them got upset.
It was like,

1588
01:06:52,991 --> 01:06:53,980
no,
I had these people on this side.

1589
01:06:54,130 --> 01:06:56,400
They're pretty good.
How'd you do search?

1590
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,110
That's Hilarious,
man.

1591
01:06:58,230 --> 01:06:59,290
Yeah,
act out and stuff.

1592
01:06:59,291 --> 01:07:01,000
Anyway,
he's always doing shit like that.

1593
01:07:01,180 --> 01:07:03,950
So it's just really fun.
I don't know.

1594
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:05,560
So that's what I'm looking forward to.

1595
01:07:06,270 --> 01:07:06,870
Um,

1596
01:07:08,420 --> 01:07:09,750
I don't know who else is,
so birds are,

1597
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:11,120
so I got to see Louis.

1598
01:07:14,470 --> 01:07:15,610
I don't know who else.
How about you?

1599
01:07:16,230 --> 01:07:18,720
Um,
I gotta finish on there.

1600
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:22,000
I've got to finish looking.
Oh yeah.

1601
01:07:22,150 --> 01:07:27,150
I gotta compile a list so of just when 
you feel like at some point you're just 

1602
01:07:27,150 --> 01:07:27,150
sitting there like,
oh,

1603
01:07:27,150 --> 01:07:27,340
you know what,
I'll see a standup special today.

1604
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,020
Last thing I saw was burst new.
Special shall I,

1605
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:33,190
I liked versus special.
I think I'm like Ali Wong special.

1606
01:07:33,191 --> 01:07:34,420
I never would have got to see that 
otherwise.

1607
01:07:34,770 --> 01:07:35,710
Yeah,
that was really good.

1608
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:37,210
I like working with her at the store 
too.

1609
01:07:37,211 --> 01:07:39,930
She's super nice.
Fuck her Jews,

1610
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:41,500
dude.
I thought we agreed.

1611
01:07:42,550 --> 01:07:43,210
Yeah,
she's cool.

1612
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:45,040
She's nice.
Let's keep going.

1613
01:07:46,690 --> 01:07:47,800
Yeah,
I like that one a lot.

1614
01:07:47,820 --> 01:07:50,560
Birds was really funny.
Um,

1615
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:54,920
we sound like a netflix commercial.
Yeah,

1616
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:57,520
I guess we should just trying to pump up
that show folks.

1617
01:07:57,521 --> 01:07:58,690
Don't get all shelly on me.

1618
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:02,620
Fucking shells.
Shells.

1619
01:08:02,621 --> 01:08:04,000
You know,
who knows where it's at.

1620
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:08,740
Fucking pussies.
Amazon prime is so superior.

1621
01:08:09,490 --> 01:08:14,490
Have.
Did you seen the Alexa Jones where it's 

1622
01:08:14,490 --> 01:08:16,400
like you talked to Amazon.
Has that.

1623
01:08:16,401 --> 01:08:18,060
Alexa is the box.
Yeah.

1624
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:20,420
What's it looks at Jones.
Alex Jones.

1625
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:25,920
You talked to.
It's like lumen eyes watching you right 

1626
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:28,490
now from the skies.
Alexa please.

1627
01:08:28,580 --> 01:08:30,080
Conspiracy theory.
Well,

1628
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:32,930
it's really funny man.
That's funny.

1629
01:08:33,020 --> 01:08:38,020
They made a video for it.
What do you think of that story that 

1630
01:08:38,020 --> 01:08:38,470
people get mad that he was on?
Well,

1631
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:43,610
I guess it's um,
it's super complicated.

1632
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:46,950
Why Blacks?
Yeah,

1633
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:52,540
what Megan Kelly said that justifies it 
in my eyes is that she said he's not 

1634
01:08:52,540 --> 01:08:53,990
going away.
She's like,

1635
01:08:54,050 --> 01:08:59,050
look,
he's a guy who's out here is doing this 

1636
01:08:59,050 --> 01:08:59,050
thing.
Let's find out.

1637
01:08:59,050 --> 01:08:59,270
What the fuck are you really?
Yeah,

1638
01:08:59,420 --> 01:09:00,920
I like that.
Does I like that?

1639
01:09:03,580 --> 01:09:04,840
I like that.
I don't know.

1640
01:09:05,470 --> 01:09:10,470
Well,
you don't want to hear all sides and he 

1641
01:09:10,470 --> 01:09:10,470
has been around for a while.
He doesn't do that mainstream shit,

1642
01:09:10,470 --> 01:09:11,320
right?
No,

1643
01:09:12,370 --> 01:09:15,670
not much at all.
So it's amazing how tired you get.

1644
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:19,390
Just a little uphill chasse.
40 five pound plate on.

1645
01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:21,710
So this is fucking gorgeous out here.
Yeah,

1646
01:09:22,070 --> 01:09:23,590
it's pretty.
Rocks are great.

1647
01:09:23,591 --> 01:09:25,810
California has so many of these pieces.
Awesome.

1648
01:09:26,670 --> 01:09:29,460
So you just start coming out here now.
Okay.

1649
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:38,280
No,
I've always said there's a bunch of 

1650
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:38,280
different places.
I go.

1651
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:38,280
Different paths though because you can 
go that way or that way.

1652
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:40,780
We got a really cool place that has more
people,

1653
01:09:41,470 --> 01:09:43,540
but it's pretty fucking spectacular.
Really?

1654
01:09:43,810 --> 01:09:44,770
Yeah.
I'll take you next time.

1655
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:49,750
Good hiking.
That'd be a cool house to have with your

1656
01:09:49,751 --> 01:09:51,040
backyard.
Either one of those.

1657
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:53,350
Yeah.
Oh,

1658
01:09:53,420 --> 01:09:55,530
they have steps right into the.
Yup.

1659
01:09:55,560 --> 01:10:00,560
Get into it.
It's so pretty out here at this place.

1660
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:03,810
Now.
All these places around here,

1661
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:05,890
like

1662
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:09,850
this is where the fires hit man.
Oh really?

1663
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:14,880
Oh.
Must of torn right up and right over 

1664
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:14,880
there.
Houses.

1665
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:14,880
Oh,
every now and then.

1666
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:19,380
Yeah,
but again it goes right up the thing to 

1667
01:10:19,380 --> 01:10:19,380
pay and gets lit up.
Some dictated.

1668
01:10:19,380 --> 01:10:24,090
Throws a cigarette out the window.
I saw a fire start on the back wall of 

1669
01:10:24,090 --> 01:10:27,421
pink.like
in the parking lot from my bathroom 

1670
01:10:27,421 --> 01:10:30,301
window.
You see it just a little bit and it 

1671
01:10:30,301 --> 01:10:30,301
climbed up that wall within like 10 
minutes.

1672
01:10:30,301 --> 01:10:33,760
It was all fucking gone and over.
Who Jesus Christ

1673
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:40,180
haven't placed wouldn't be really.

1674
01:10:44,860 --> 01:10:48,190
Imagine if we get to a point that never 
happened anymore.

1675
01:10:50,250 --> 01:10:54,220
People just stop robbing people and 
beating people up and shed.

1676
01:10:55,210 --> 01:11:00,140
Unless it's a prearranged fight.
Imagine how much better the world of God

1677
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:04,210
if just people stopped robbing each 
other.

1678
01:11:04,310 --> 01:11:06,370
Just like just fucking happier stuff.
I'll have my stuff.

1679
01:11:06,970 --> 01:11:09,160
Yeah,
it will be pretty good at.

1680
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:10,810
That never was an issue if trump was 
like,

1681
01:11:10,811 --> 01:11:15,811
all right,
all the rest of the stuff that you guys 

1682
01:11:15,811 --> 01:11:15,811
take before.
It's way worse than think,

1683
01:11:15,811 --> 01:11:18,380
but I think I know more Roberts at all 
if like people as cannibalism.

1684
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:21,780
Yeah.
No.

1685
01:11:22,470 --> 01:11:25,170
You think there is that in America?
In America?

1686
01:11:25,790 --> 01:11:28,050
Not really.
Somewhere in the world for sure.

1687
01:11:29,620 --> 01:11:31,350
There's got to be neighborhoods where 
you're pretty safe.

1688
01:11:31,351 --> 01:11:33,760
Most of the time.
There was an island in Indonesia.

1689
01:11:33,761 --> 01:11:37,030
I were as of 1999.
There were headhunting woo.

1690
01:11:37,670 --> 01:11:42,670
Yeah,
it would stop for awhile and then like 

1691
01:11:42,670 --> 01:11:42,670
another country would come in there and 
said,

1692
01:11:42,670 --> 01:11:47,361
hey,
you guys go back to head hunting and 

1693
01:11:47,361 --> 01:11:48,621
they were just would for like 40 years.
Here's something really dark about a 

1694
01:11:48,621 --> 01:11:48,621
dude.
Chase snapped your head.

1695
01:11:48,621 --> 01:11:49,020
Yeah.
They say,

1696
01:11:49,021 --> 01:11:51,180
if you drink the blood fucking what are 
their names?

1697
01:11:51,181 --> 01:11:53,970
I forget now of your enemy that was 
fighting you.

1698
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,950
It's just super powerful.
Oh boy.

1699
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:58,040
But only if they're fighting you 
cheeses.

1700
01:12:06,630 --> 01:12:07,400
Good workout,
Huh?

1701
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:08,550
Yeah,
it is.

1702
01:12:09,540 --> 01:12:11,870
Especially when you're talking.
Yeah.

1703
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:12,710
We don't breathe.
Right.

1704
01:12:13,550 --> 01:12:15,690
Do you have to see what people are 
talking shows about the whole time?

1705
01:12:16,470 --> 01:12:19,440
That's a beautiful thing about what the 
Diaz brothers can do.

1706
01:12:19,980 --> 01:12:21,440
Talk and fight.
Yeah.

1707
01:12:21,570 --> 01:12:23,610
I hate when they shut them up.
I get so mad at that.

1708
01:12:24,230 --> 01:12:25,530
Like this has nothing to do with the 
rules.

1709
01:12:25,590 --> 01:12:26,730
That's what I'm saying.
Let them talk.

1710
01:12:26,731 --> 01:12:28,890
There's nothing to do with the rules.
What is a fucking Dick shot?

1711
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:29,700
No.
Yeah.

1712
01:12:29,820 --> 01:12:32,040
I wonder what that is.
If he's running and talking,

1713
01:12:32,041 --> 01:12:32,430
he'd be like,
Hey,

1714
01:12:32,431 --> 01:12:37,431
shut your fucking mouth.
I just wonder if that's written 

1715
01:12:37,431 --> 01:12:37,431
somewhere.
I don't think they should say anything.

1716
01:12:37,431 --> 01:12:37,431
Yeah,
because then it's like,

1717
01:12:37,431 --> 01:12:42,411
dude,
don't get picked to be involved in the 

1718
01:12:42,411 --> 01:12:42,411
fight.
I agree.

1719
01:12:42,411 --> 01:12:43,470
Especially when a lot of fighters enjoy 
doing it.

1720
01:12:44,430 --> 01:12:48,060
Dennis Johnson or Michael Johnson Rather
Dennis Johnson.

1721
01:12:48,990 --> 01:12:53,520
Michael Johnson could only talk trash 
with their hands.

1722
01:12:53,521 --> 01:12:54,960
That's the new rule.
Fuck that.

1723
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:59,670
So I don't think you should do it,
but I think if you want to do it,

1724
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:00,870
it's your right.
Yeah.

1725
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:04,270
Who's the worst trash talker in mma?
The worst.

1726
01:13:04,540 --> 01:13:05,280
Who Have you seen?
Be Like,

1727
01:13:05,310 --> 01:13:06,300
oh dude,
shut up.

1728
01:13:06,301 --> 01:13:09,660
You're so bad.
This is a good question.

1729
01:13:10,020 --> 01:13:12,450
A lot of them do that and they wait for 
this applause that never comes.

1730
01:13:13,140 --> 01:13:13,870
And you're like,
oh yeah man,

1731
01:13:13,871 --> 01:13:18,871
that wasn't a great alon.
Well Randy coture is almost too nice to 

1732
01:13:18,871 --> 01:13:19,230
be a trash talker.
Yeah.

1733
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:20,790
No,
I mean other people who do it.

1734
01:13:20,910 --> 01:13:22,470
Oh,
people would do it badly,

1735
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:26,790
but randy redd never really talked to 
randy.

1736
01:13:26,791 --> 01:13:27,480
Wouldn't do it.
He wouldn't be.

1737
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:32,370
But do you think that a lot of guys are 
doing it now?

1738
01:13:32,670 --> 01:13:33,570
Yeah.
To get famous.

1739
01:13:33,620 --> 01:13:34,290
Yeah.
Yeah.

1740
01:13:34,291 --> 01:13:35,820
But I'm saying,
so you gotta get a lot of those guys who

1741
01:13:35,821 --> 01:13:37,300
don't know how to do it right?
Yeah.

1742
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:42,500
Well I could.
Poker players did that a lot where they 

1743
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:42,500
started like,
Oh,

1744
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:42,500
if you're flamboyant will get on more,
get more sponsorships.

1745
01:13:42,590 --> 01:13:45,030
But you've seen people faking it.
That's true.

1746
01:13:45,780 --> 01:13:50,780
And also part of what's exciting about a
guy like conor is that there's only one 

1747
01:13:51,421 --> 01:13:55,720
of them.
There's a bunch of other people that are

1748
01:13:55,721 --> 01:14:00,150
allowed mouth and funny and they're all 
doing it back and forth with each other.

1749
01:14:00,870 --> 01:14:05,870
He's not the Unicorn that's just kicking
my ass.

1750
01:14:07,620 --> 01:14:12,620
Yeah.
Forty five pounds and it adds up after 

1751
01:14:12,620 --> 01:14:12,620
awhile,
Huh?

1752
01:14:12,620 --> 01:14:12,620
Yeah.
Does

1753
01:14:13,870 --> 01:14:18,870
he know what I mean?
It's almost like it'd be too much white 

1754
01:14:18,870 --> 01:14:18,970
noise because there was 10 conners.
You know what I mean?

1755
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:19,720
Yeah.
It'd be annoying.

1756
01:14:19,721 --> 01:14:20,200
It's like,
all right,

1757
01:14:20,780 --> 01:14:21,610
leave him alone.
Yeah.

1758
01:14:21,700 --> 01:14:24,520
If somebody really want to diminish 
them,

1759
01:14:25,180 --> 01:14:26,800
so just make a bunch of other dudes 
talk.

1760
01:14:26,801 --> 01:14:31,801
Exactly like nullify them.
I'm the number one Irish fighter.

1761
01:14:32,980 --> 01:14:37,980
Yeah.
All of Ireland's on my side have a 

1762
01:14:37,980 --> 01:14:40,000
massive troll.
Fixed fights.

1763
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:45,040
Got With Gut.
Did you see that video of him faking 

1764
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:45,040
getting punched for the mayweather fight
with conor?

1765
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:46,000
Did they were like,
he looks terrible.

1766
01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:47,050
What do you mean?
He's just like.

1767
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:49,540
He's like,
it's not as bad as I'm doing it,

1768
01:14:49,541 --> 01:14:52,520
but it's one step above what were like,
he doesn't know boxing.

1769
01:14:52,550 --> 01:14:54,280
Look at his fights that you had a hidden
camera.

1770
01:14:54,830 --> 01:14:56,180
Oh,
have him fucking connor,

1771
01:14:56,190 --> 01:15:01,190
but yeah,
I saw that video of him sparring with 

1772
01:15:01,190 --> 01:15:01,190
that professional boxer.

1773
01:15:01,190 --> 01:15:01,750
It's fake.
He knows how to punch.

1774
01:15:01,910 --> 01:15:03,280
He was blocking it like with his 
fucking.

1775
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:05,290
I don't think it's fake.
No Way.

1776
01:15:05,450 --> 01:15:07,840
He was just moving around with the guys 
are really good boxer.

1777
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:11,080
I was trying to find his range.
He's trying to be unorthodox and think I

1778
01:15:11,081 --> 01:15:13,210
was a very skillful boxer.
I forgot his name.

1779
01:15:13,870 --> 01:15:15,670
Maybe you could remember his name for 
the outro.

1780
01:15:15,671 --> 01:15:18,270
Find that.
Whose name is your bucket list of tears.

1781
01:15:18,550 --> 01:15:19,710
No tears.
How's it mind?

1782
01:15:19,750 --> 01:15:20,770
You're going to put it out.
Oh,

1783
01:15:20,771 --> 01:15:23,950
I want to put it up to the special.
Confuse the shit out of me.

1784
01:15:24,230 --> 01:15:25,110
Oh,
okay.

1785
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:26,170
Well,
whatever.

1786
01:15:26,380 --> 01:15:28,060
We got it now.
I got it together.

1787
01:15:28,540 --> 01:15:29,770
I'm so high.
I forgot the timing.

1788
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:31,630
What was I saying?
Jamie?

1789
01:15:31,631 --> 01:15:36,631
Look up that fighter's name.
Who was a skilled fighter that regard 

1790
01:15:36,631 --> 01:15:36,631
with condom was boxing.
He's very good.

1791
01:15:36,631 --> 01:15:37,120
He's very good.

1792
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:40,180
Like you could see beautiful crisp 
motions.

1793
01:15:40,270 --> 01:15:45,220
He's a solid professional boxer.
I got a really high level and uh,

1794
01:15:45,221 --> 01:15:45,780
he,
you know,

1795
01:15:45,790 --> 01:15:50,790
definitely got the better of conor,
but that doesn't mean that like conner 

1796
01:15:50,790 --> 01:15:53,740
wasn't working on specific things or 
wasn't working that much on boxing.

1797
01:15:53,950 --> 01:15:54,870
When did this happen?
What,

1798
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:56,200
what was he really trying to concentrate
on?

1799
01:15:56,230 --> 01:15:56,680
Oh,
right.

1800
01:15:56,681 --> 01:15:58,390
Maybe you're just trying to work on 
ranch where you're like,

1801
01:15:58,410 --> 01:16:03,410
all right,
let me just get close to you and say he 

1802
01:16:03,410 --> 01:16:03,410
could be trying to work on a lot of 
things.

1803
01:16:03,410 --> 01:16:03,410
He could be.
It looks stupid bad though.

1804
01:16:03,460 --> 01:16:04,420
You're right.
It does.

1805
01:16:04,450 --> 01:16:07,750
He could be trying to take as minimal 
amount of damage as possible.

1806
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:12,840
Not commit himself very much,
but see what it's like to move around 

1807
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:14,320
and spar with a guy who's a worldclass 
boxer.

1808
01:16:14,530 --> 01:16:17,110
Like they had hidden camera footage of 
you like on your back and you're like,

1809
01:16:17,111 --> 01:16:18,640
no,
I was working off my back for that whole

1810
01:16:18,641 --> 01:16:19,150
two months.

1811
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:24,300
Well,
most Jujitsu guys I think are super 

1812
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:24,300
aware of that kind of stuff.
Like there's a lot of guys,

1813
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:25,390
but it would be the similar to that 
where he's like,

1814
01:16:25,420 --> 01:16:26,260
no,
what you think is bad.

1815
01:16:26,261 --> 01:16:28,120
It's not bad at all.
I'm trying to get in that position.

1816
01:16:28,210 --> 01:16:33,210
Yeah.
Like you can get a picture of John 

1817
01:16:33,210 --> 01:16:33,210
Jacques getting stuck inside control 
every day with one of his blue belts.

1818
01:16:33,430 --> 01:16:36,610
He lets you do it so that he gets you in
a position and was like,

1819
01:16:36,611 --> 01:16:38,110
okay,
I'm going to sweep you now.

1820
01:16:39,790 --> 01:16:44,790
Next thing you know you're on your back,
but like you can take pictures of it 

1821
01:16:44,790 --> 01:16:44,790
right there and say,
oh my God,

1822
01:16:44,790 --> 01:16:45,990
that guy was getting the better.
John Jack.

1823
01:16:45,991 --> 01:16:47,380
He had been inside control.
He'd be like,

1824
01:16:48,350 --> 01:16:51,250
John Jack instead of four second clip.
I just played that.

1825
01:16:51,251 --> 01:16:56,251
I mean,
you don't really know what you're 

1826
01:16:56,251 --> 01:16:56,251
looking at,
but you know,

1827
01:16:56,251 --> 01:16:56,251
you're looking at a guy who's a super 
high level box or that guy looks,

1828
01:16:56,251 --> 01:16:56,530
he looks sweet.

1829
01:16:56,770 --> 01:16:59,350
I like what he's doing and he's.
He's definitely getting the better.

1830
01:16:59,370 --> 01:17:01,120
Connor.
It didn't look good on connor's part,

1831
01:17:01,121 --> 01:17:02,890
but again,
I don't know what connor was working on.

1832
01:17:02,891 --> 01:17:05,080
I don't know if he was maybe be a,
you know,

1833
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:06,730
how many training sessions he's doing a 
day.

1834
01:17:06,940 --> 01:17:08,830
What do you know whether he's got 
injuries,

1835
01:17:09,110 --> 01:17:12,230
why is he just boxing is going to have 
an MMA fight.

1836
01:17:12,450 --> 01:17:14,000
Is it,
is it before the Nate Diaz?

1837
01:17:14,001 --> 01:17:16,000
Right.
When is it exactly that they respond.

1838
01:17:16,130 --> 01:17:16,650
Oh,
right.

1839
01:17:17,150 --> 01:17:18,230
Oh yeah,
a good point.

1840
01:17:18,231 --> 01:17:21,200
It could have been fucking years ago.
Who is he preparing for know?

1841
01:17:21,230 --> 01:17:26,230
Was he preparing to throw kicks?
Was he working on his range in the 

1842
01:17:26,230 --> 01:17:26,540
world?
That merriweather,

1843
01:17:26,810 --> 01:17:31,810
who the fuck knows?
I say no way more than I don't know 

1844
01:17:31,810 --> 01:17:31,810
shit,
but I said no way.

1845
01:17:31,810 --> 01:17:32,290
Is it less than eight for May?
Whether.

1846
01:17:33,030 --> 01:17:38,030
No,
as far as the rounds like dominated the 

1847
01:17:38,030 --> 01:17:40,811
fight probably tend to maybe even.
You would be crazy to bet on a guy with 

1848
01:17:41,510 --> 01:17:44,870
zero professionals that are done.
It's almost rude to boxing to say he has

1849
01:17:44,871 --> 01:17:49,610
a chance almost man,
and he's taken on literally the greatest

1850
01:17:49,611 --> 01:17:51,700
defensive boxer ever.
I mean,

1851
01:17:51,770 --> 01:17:52,450
come on.
Sign.

1852
01:17:56,810 --> 01:17:57,080
Good.

1853
01:17:58,220 --> 01:17:58,940
Yeah,
exactly.

1854
01:17:58,970 --> 01:17:59,790
It's almost like,
come on,

1855
01:17:59,970 --> 01:18:02,240
it's like those people think they can 
just stand up just just on the spot.

1856
01:18:02,930 --> 01:18:05,240
It's kind of similar.
It's kind of similar,

1857
01:18:05,241 --> 01:18:08,780
but you connor does know how to punch 
and he punches very hard.

1858
01:18:09,020 --> 01:18:10,790
Yes,
you're right.

1859
01:18:11,330 --> 01:18:15,710
But he's a bigger guy and he's bigger.
Oh yeah.

1860
01:18:15,740 --> 01:18:20,740
Yeah.
He's a lot bigger and he's going to 

1861
01:18:20,740 --> 01:18:20,740
watch it live.
No,

1862
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:23,990
because that's sold out two shows in DC.
Bitch.

1863
01:18:24,020 --> 01:18:25,970
Really?
Where you playing some theater?

1864
01:18:26,630 --> 01:18:27,950
That's what I grew up.
Oh Shit.

1865
01:18:27,980 --> 01:18:28,970
That's right.
You know what's called?

1866
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:30,860
Um,
you never know.

1867
01:18:30,861 --> 01:18:31,670
That's the.
I do not.

1868
01:18:33,530 --> 01:18:34,850
I'll be there.
Washington DC.

1869
01:18:34,910 --> 01:18:37,450
Whenever your theaters called Hey,
Hebrew Academy.

1870
01:18:37,460 --> 01:18:42,460
Go head out and that's where you went 
for a little while then Jewish day 

1871
01:18:42,561 --> 01:18:43,490
school.
Wow.

1872
01:18:43,491 --> 01:18:44,570
Switch.
Go to the bad kid.

1873
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:46,640
You're a bad.
It's less religious school.

1874
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:50,570
Have you ever met a comedian?
That wasn't a bad kid.

1875
01:18:51,830 --> 01:18:52,240
MMM.

1876
01:18:53,130 --> 01:18:54,030
Like troubled.
Like,

1877
01:18:54,260 --> 01:18:56,190
like and stuff.
Yeah.

1878
01:18:56,191 --> 01:19:01,191
At least troubled.
Were there any kids though that we're 

1879
01:19:01,191 --> 01:19:01,340
not troubled?
I mean,

1880
01:19:01,380 --> 01:19:06,380
did your kids get in trouble?
I mean they don't like once a year they 

1881
01:19:06,380 --> 01:19:08,010
don't get in trouble and you know,
their kids,

1882
01:19:08,011 --> 01:19:10,110
they do stupid things so they don't 
understand.

1883
01:19:10,290 --> 01:19:15,290
Shouldn't even say stupid.
I would say they do careless things 

1884
01:19:15,290 --> 01:19:17,390
sometimes because they don't understand.
But you know,

1885
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
real troubles.
Their little hole.

1886
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:23,350
I mean your big one to know.
Yeah.

1887
01:19:23,370 --> 01:19:26,090
I don't know many comics who weren't in 
trouble a lot.

1888
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:31,520
I feel like people are learning every 
generation how to be nicer to their 

1889
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:36,471
family members.
Every generation they're getting better 

1890
01:19:36,471 --> 01:19:39,531
at it now.
I had a buddy when I grew up with in 

1891
01:19:39,531 --> 01:19:43,100
Boston and his dad was super strict and 
dad would fucking hit him and scream at 

1892
01:19:44,281 --> 01:19:47,920
him and shit and he,
his dad was crazy and you know,

1893
01:19:47,970 --> 01:19:51,810
he had had enough of it by the time we 
were in highschool and it's,

1894
01:19:53,050 --> 01:19:58,050
I don't know,
it's hard to see shit like that enough 

1895
01:19:58,050 --> 01:19:58,050
of is like malvern off if you had 
enough.

1896
01:19:58,050 --> 01:19:59,280
His Dad hitting him.
Oh really?

1897
01:19:59,540 --> 01:20:04,540
Yeah,
so we hit them back or you just get the 

1898
01:20:04,540 --> 01:20:05,460
fuck off my back,
but he gets close to that.

1899
01:20:05,461 --> 01:20:08,490
But I think what my point is I in his 
dad's generation

1900
01:20:08,490 --> 01:20:11,100
and that's what everybody did.
They beat the shit out of their kids and

1901
01:20:11,101 --> 01:20:14,290
then his generation before that,
they beat the shit out of their kids and

1902
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:19,400
I think like people today are figuring 
out how to be nicer to each other.

1903
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:23,040
Like every day we're getting better at 
it.

1904
01:20:23,340 --> 01:20:25,590
It seems like it.
I really believe that man.

1905
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:27,430
I really believe that.
I,

1906
01:20:27,431 --> 01:20:28,980
I really believe that people are getting
better.

1907
01:20:29,340 --> 01:20:30,420
Have been,
hey,

1908
01:20:30,421 --> 01:20:33,240
how are you just being nice.
I wonder if some of this like,

1909
01:20:34,110 --> 01:20:39,110
you know,
the division that's happening now 

1910
01:20:39,110 --> 01:20:39,690
between liberal and conservative and 
like left and right and stuff where it's

1911
01:20:39,691 --> 01:20:41,940
make people sort of appreciate sometimes
with me,

1912
01:20:41,941 --> 01:20:42,870
it helps where it's like,
all right,

1913
01:20:42,871 --> 01:20:45,060
we'll give him a lot of freedoms,
but he's still got som,

1914
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:49,110
like walking into a fucking forest like 
that nature.

1915
01:20:49,350 --> 01:20:51,060
That's great.
Yeah.

1916
01:20:51,061 --> 01:20:52,860
So with that you get the thing too.
It's like look,

1917
01:20:52,861 --> 01:20:54,510
whatever.
But let's be kind to each other,

1918
01:20:54,660 --> 01:20:56,820
right?
Or No?

1919
01:20:57,270 --> 01:21:01,110
Well,
I just think that people.

1920
01:21:01,340 --> 01:21:06,340
I mean this is a been dwell on this more
than any other thought in the last few 

1921
01:21:06,340 --> 01:21:08,120
years,
is that people are all red lined.

1922
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:11,250
What does.
They're all taxed out like as far as the

1923
01:21:11,251 --> 01:21:15,630
amount of stress they go through without
physical exercise.

1924
01:21:16,170 --> 01:21:21,170
The amount of angst and anxiety they go 
through without resolution will be 

1925
01:21:21,170 --> 01:21:22,920
aware.
Work life just seems to stay in the same

1926
01:21:22,921 --> 01:21:27,921
state.
There's so many people that find 

1927
01:21:27,921 --> 01:21:27,921
themselves in these traps.

1928
01:21:28,890 --> 01:21:33,890
I've been thinking about it more and 
more over the last few years and what 

1929
01:21:35,101 --> 01:21:37,250
happens to them.
It's just,

1930
01:21:37,470 --> 01:21:40,970
it's just nothing comes good at it,
you know,

1931
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:44,160
you know,
so what does that do with niceness?

1932
01:21:45,170 --> 01:21:50,170
I think that just trying to look at 
trying to look at what's the.

1933
01:21:50,940 --> 01:21:52,950
What are the good interactions that you 
ever have with people?

1934
01:21:52,951 --> 01:21:56,730
How much of them are initiated by you?
How much of her initiated by a situation

1935
01:21:56,731 --> 01:21:59,160
that maybe could have gone sideways if 
you were a defensive.

1936
01:21:59,630 --> 01:22:01,850
We were just high and low labs.
They're like,

1937
01:22:01,851 --> 01:22:03,940
what?
And we've all felt good.

1938
01:22:03,941 --> 01:22:08,941
There's so much standoffishness here.
I know you look at people and they look 

1939
01:22:08,941 --> 01:22:09,270
down like,
like almost like try to intimidate you.

1940
01:22:09,271 --> 01:22:10,740
It's just like,
for what?

1941
01:22:11,210 --> 01:22:16,210
I mean it was gone,
but it was like I just saw a 

1942
01:22:16,210 --> 01:22:16,210
friendliness before and then it's like 
there's still,

1943
01:22:16,220 --> 01:22:18,690
there's a difference here,
but there's like this meanness if there.

1944
01:22:19,050 --> 01:22:24,050
Well there's some for sure,
but there's also an overpopulation 

1945
01:22:24,050 --> 01:22:24,050
issue,
you know,

1946
01:22:24,050 --> 01:22:27,000
they did some kind of crazy study on a 
radiolab podcast.

1947
01:22:27,001 --> 01:22:32,001
Again for it you'll have plugged boom.
He talked about how there's this direct 

1948
01:22:32,001 --> 01:22:35,670
correlation between how fast people were
walking,

1949
01:22:35,671 --> 01:22:40,671
like how many steps they take like per 
minute on average versus the population 

1950
01:22:41,281 --> 01:22:45,630
in that city and how many syllables they
say in a certain amount of time,

1951
01:22:46,440 --> 01:22:49,510
how quickly they talk,
which are really like.

1952
01:22:49,710 --> 01:22:54,710
Because you have no time to actually 
formulate words because I wasn't going 

1953
01:22:54,710 --> 01:22:56,910
to rupture because so many people.
So you talk faster probably Dave Smith.

1954
01:22:56,930 --> 01:22:59,750
It get in quicker.
You can't,

1955
01:22:59,790 --> 01:23:02,100
you can't just lay back.
Right.

1956
01:23:02,510 --> 01:23:03,900
So you have to like rush.
Yeah,

1957
01:23:04,210 --> 01:23:06,150
like,
like a big family.

1958
01:23:06,151 --> 01:23:08,650
You've got to rush to get that chicken.
Oh,

1959
01:23:08,651 --> 01:23:09,790
interesting.
Fascinating,

1960
01:23:09,791 --> 01:23:10,690
right?
Yeah.

1961
01:23:11,980 --> 01:23:15,550
So they sounded like small towns,
slower walking,

1962
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:19,870
slower talking,
and you could tell by setting up cameras

1963
01:23:20,260 --> 01:23:22,840
in two locations on a busy street how 
fast people walked.

1964
01:23:23,170 --> 01:23:24,940
You could tell the exact population of 
the city.

1965
01:23:25,180 --> 01:23:25,810
Wow.
Really?

1966
01:23:26,410 --> 01:23:27,430
Yeah.
Wow.

1967
01:23:27,550 --> 01:23:30,160
I think you can walk fast in New York.
They really do.

1968
01:23:30,161 --> 01:23:32,230
It's fast enough.
You can make it to the side.

1969
01:23:32,290 --> 01:23:34,330
Yeah.
It's almost like athletics.

1970
01:23:35,080 --> 01:23:37,180
Yeah.
They put a hustle to it.

1971
01:23:37,450 --> 01:23:38,800
I was walking with a girl and she was 
like,

1972
01:23:39,140 --> 01:23:40,300
why?
Where are you going?

1973
01:23:41,620 --> 01:23:43,450
Why are you running people bump people 
too.

1974
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:43,940
Yeah,
yeah,

1975
01:23:43,941 --> 01:23:46,240
yeah.
It's a lot of bumping.

1976
01:23:46,590 --> 01:23:49,400
Had somebody to call me a dick.
Oh yeah.

1977
01:23:50,120 --> 01:23:55,120
I tried to get by.
She's putting on her coat and I waited 

1978
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:55,120
for a minute and they're like,
oh fuck it.

1979
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:55,240
I'll just get buyer.
And then I walked by,

1980
01:23:55,241 --> 01:23:56,290
she started walking,
so like,

1981
01:23:56,300 --> 01:23:57,490
you know,
hit cholon shoulder.

1982
01:23:58,120 --> 01:24:01,030
Not hard or anything.
And I kept going and then she was like,

1983
01:24:01,031 --> 01:24:02,560
Dick and I was like,
all right,

1984
01:24:02,561 --> 01:24:03,310
I'm not going to get into it.

1985
01:24:03,970 --> 01:24:04,930
So I kept walking,
she was like,

1986
01:24:04,931 --> 01:24:09,931
Damn.
I kept walking in shoes outside to just 

1987
01:24:09,931 --> 01:24:11,140
screaming,
oh my God.

1988
01:24:11,890 --> 01:24:15,190
How many times?
Probably four times outside to inside.

1989
01:24:15,430 --> 01:24:19,030
Have you done this on stage yet?
There's something there,

1990
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:21,250
dude.
Jesus,

1991
01:24:21,251 --> 01:24:26,251
let it go by.
You can imagine what a psychopath to do 

1992
01:24:27,270 --> 01:24:30,560
that the guy was doing that to you.
How scared you can tell you.

1993
01:24:30,580 --> 01:24:31,930
Oh my God,
I bumped a crazy guy.

1994
01:24:32,470 --> 01:24:34,240
I better get the fuck outta here.
Sorry Bro.

1995
01:24:34,890 --> 01:24:35,890
Oh No.
Part of me was like,

1996
01:24:35,950 --> 01:24:36,910
at that point,
turning around like,

1997
01:24:37,010 --> 01:24:40,360
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to Hudson.

1998
01:24:40,361 --> 01:24:40,870
Hilarious.

1999
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:51,010
We were camping.
This goes to that point and uh,

2000
01:24:51,180 --> 01:24:56,180
we're in this good repeat looking at us.
We're walking here with hold on 

2001
01:24:56,180 --> 01:24:59,900
microphones while we hike.
I got a backpack on with a weight plate 

2002
01:24:59,900 --> 01:25:04,231
on it.
It's colored like Captain America's 

2003
01:25:04,231 --> 01:25:04,510
shield.
You have a shirt on.

2004
01:25:04,810 --> 01:25:09,810
She definitely thinks we fucked.
Lady looked at me like I was the best 

2005
01:25:09,810 --> 01:25:12,490
fucking woods annually.
I see him there.

2006
01:25:12,550 --> 01:25:17,550
I knew those guys were home.
I think I had a captain America Shield 

2007
01:25:17,550 --> 01:25:18,760
on his bag is fred and I'll share it on 
the other guys in his back pocket.

2008
01:25:18,860 --> 01:25:22,390
Let's kill this podcast.
I mean.

2009
01:25:22,490 --> 01:25:23,010
Oh,
okay.

2010
01:25:23,260 --> 01:25:24,140
Oh,
because wrap it up.

2011
01:25:25,340 --> 01:25:27,820
I gotta I gotta get a move on.
All right,

2012
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:30,130
well thanks Joe as your brother.
This was fun.

2013
01:25:30,580 --> 01:25:32,200
So this was a.
we'll just call it.

2014
01:25:32,590 --> 01:25:34,420
Hey,
why don't we do this as a swap cast?

2015
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:37,270
Not just you put it out and I'll put it 
out.

2016
01:25:37,271 --> 01:25:38,630
We'll call it.
Yeah.

2017
01:25:38,900 --> 01:25:41,350
Yeah.
We'll do on that day.

2018
01:25:42,580 --> 01:25:44,250
Yeah.
Okay.

2019
01:25:44,530 --> 01:25:47,120
I'm not going to do an intro or did I 
put it out?

2020
01:25:47,460 --> 01:25:49,600
Just put it out.
You can do an intro though.

2021
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:54,960
I liked your intros.
One of my favorite parts of your 

2022
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:54,960
podcast.
Intros ran out.

2023
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:56,570
He put a lot into them.
Yeah,

2024
01:25:56,580 --> 01:26:01,580
I do them over and over again.
Sometimes it makes the podcast a little 

2025
01:26:01,580 --> 01:26:01,580
more because it's a little something 
more,

2026
01:26:01,580 --> 01:26:03,040
you know,
you got a really good work ethic,

2027
01:26:03,050 --> 01:26:04,030
dude.
You know,

2028
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:05,990
you're a guy who could fuck off for a 
few months,

2029
01:26:06,550 --> 01:26:07,940
disappeared,
vanished and shit.

2030
01:26:07,941 --> 01:26:09,260
But rejuvenator though.
Well,

2031
01:26:09,261 --> 01:26:11,520
when you're doing stuff,
you have a really good work ethic.

2032
01:26:11,630 --> 01:26:13,130
It's really inspiring.
Thanks.

2033
01:26:14,330 --> 01:26:15,290
Yeah,
thanks.

2034
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:17,120
That's nice.
Well,

2035
01:26:17,121 --> 01:26:17,840
I think,
you know,

2036
01:26:17,841 --> 01:26:20,210
I'm one of the things that I've had like
working.

2037
01:26:20,211 --> 01:26:25,211
I like doing this stuff be to one of the
things that I've learned like in the 

2038
01:26:25,211 --> 01:26:28,331
course of my life that the more people 
that I'm around that are doing things 

2039
01:26:28,331 --> 01:26:30,280
that are inspiring to me,
the more I feel good.

2040
01:26:31,010 --> 01:26:33,680
Like I feel good being around people 
that are kicking ass.

2041
01:26:33,860 --> 01:26:35,540
Right?
It feels good dude.

2042
01:26:36,070 --> 01:26:41,070
You know,
like to be around people who were like 

2043
01:26:41,070 --> 01:26:43,810
tie level to just and also to be around 
people that are your friends that are in

2044
01:26:44,100 --> 01:26:46,460
Hardee's on whether it's dss on the 
show,

2045
01:26:46,461 --> 01:26:48,500
this guy's making money,
this guy's got an audience,

2046
01:26:48,501 --> 01:26:49,430
this guy's doing this.

2047
01:26:49,700 --> 01:26:51,810
Everybody's killing it.
It's,

2048
01:26:51,980 --> 01:26:54,470
it's a pretty good time.
They bitch man about the bloggers,

2049
01:26:54,770 --> 01:26:57,680
but that's just a small negative with a 
giant positive.

2050
01:26:57,740 --> 01:26:58,560
Yeah,
it was.

2051
01:26:58,980 --> 01:27:01,140
People are always going to have opinions
on what the,

2052
01:27:01,270 --> 01:27:06,270
the giant positive is.
There's a lot of people that get to 

2053
01:27:06,270 --> 01:27:08,420
enjoy your content and overwhelmed.
It evens out like you don't like.

2054
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:13,480
There's a lot of people that are just 
looking for things to criticize and 

2055
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:16,331
looking to be outraged and looking to 
try to figure out what's the next angle 

2056
01:27:16,331 --> 01:27:19,691
for their outrage and really a lot of it
is really just a kind of creative 

2057
01:27:19,691 --> 01:27:22,751
exercise.
Looking for easy targets were good 

2058
01:27:22,751 --> 01:27:22,960
targets and it makes sense to me.
I totally understand it.

2059
01:27:23,730 --> 01:27:24,820
Trolling.
Yeah,

2060
01:27:24,830 --> 01:27:29,830
but I think that we're entering into a 
very interesting time as far as like 

2061
01:27:29,830 --> 01:27:32,580
your ability to distribute stuff just to
like put it right up.

2062
01:27:32,610 --> 01:27:34,700
Cool stuff that people enjoy.
Like podcasts,

2063
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:40,120
you know,
mean a bunch of people we don't even 

2064
01:27:40,120 --> 01:27:40,120
know.
Just went on a hike with us.

2065
01:27:40,120 --> 01:27:43,190
What do you mean?
We're already talking about these folks.

2066
01:27:43,560 --> 01:27:46,820
They just went on a legit hike with us 
for a few miles.

2067
01:27:47,500 --> 01:27:49,160
Don't forget if you heard him get 
winded.

2068
01:27:49,161 --> 01:27:51,950
It's obviously because he's kind of a 45
pounds.

2069
01:27:52,230 --> 01:27:54,170
It is not.
It's not that heavy.

2070
01:27:54,171 --> 01:27:56,870
A lot of guys use 90.
There's a lot of guys are doing things.

2071
01:27:56,871 --> 01:27:59,180
They put $9,
seven miles.

2072
01:27:59,420 --> 01:28:04,420
They're savages.
That's the thing about bowhunters in 

2073
01:28:04,420 --> 01:28:05,260
particular,
like people have no idea that's a.

2074
01:28:05,270 --> 01:28:07,820
that's an athletic endeavor.
One hundred percent.

2075
01:28:08,450 --> 01:28:13,450
You have to,
you're trying to keep your heart rate 

2076
01:28:13,450 --> 01:28:15,281
low,
going up hills to get close to these 

2077
01:28:15,281 --> 01:28:16,040
animals and if you're out of breath,
you're going to make a shitty shot.

2078
01:28:16,280 --> 01:28:17,930
You have to be able to keep it together 
under pressure,

2079
01:28:17,931 --> 01:28:21,260
like an athletic event,
a real thorough from walking dead.

2080
01:28:21,380 --> 01:28:23,930
Not Very.
He gets no pass throughs.

2081
01:28:24,140 --> 01:28:27,620
Everything sticks in the head,
a pass through as it goes in your head.

2082
01:28:27,621 --> 01:28:32,621
So easy.
Why is it going to go out of your head 

2083
01:28:32,621 --> 01:28:32,621
so you know,
especially those skulls of those things,

2084
01:28:32,621 --> 01:28:36,251
we can punch right through him sometimes
he doesn't get any pass throughs like I 

2085
01:28:36,251 --> 01:28:38,090
would think across both those mushy as 
Zombie heads.

2086
01:28:38,091 --> 01:28:40,820
You get clean passes.
We just blow right through that.

2087
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:42,670
Yeah,
right?

2088
01:28:44,830 --> 01:28:47,180
Yeah.
Anyway.

2089
01:28:47,420 --> 01:28:48,120
Anyway.
Alright,

2090
01:28:48,170 --> 01:28:49,260
well fun times,
Arusha,

2091
01:28:49,290 --> 01:28:51,950
fear.
