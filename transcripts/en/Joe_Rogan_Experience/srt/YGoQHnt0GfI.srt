1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,160
The joe rogan experience buddy don't as
a motherfucker and go on stay red ban.

2
00:00:08,381 --> 00:00:09,550
You Miss Friday night.

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,420
I know I heard about this Friday night
how I fucking almost had a nervous

4
00:00:13,421 --> 00:00:14,730
breakdown the time.

5
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:16,093
Did he tell you,

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,840
remember when you and your wife were
asking me questions and I was fidgety?

7
00:00:19,841 --> 00:00:20,980
I was having a nervous breakdown.

8
00:00:20,981 --> 00:00:21,814
Right?

9
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:23,830
You think I'm fucking
with you guys though?

10
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:28,120
I don't know me Friday night
I bombed so hard last week.

11
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,370
You know sometimes you get
in a transition period,

12
00:00:30,371 --> 00:00:33,520
you've got all of these bits that aren't
ready and you bring them up and it's

13
00:00:33,521 --> 00:00:36,280
like you got three of them
so you bomb for two weeks,

14
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,520
but all of a sudden one
night they all come together.

15
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:39,820
Now you become a force.

16
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,230
Now it's a different game.

17
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:43,420
I was in that process for like two weeks.

18
00:00:43,421 --> 00:00:44,141
I was in limbo.

19
00:00:44,141 --> 00:00:45,460
I had good sets in Boston,

20
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:49,150
but anything I tried out of the ordinary
and Boston wasn't clicking for him.

21
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:50,890
So I just stuck to the fucking original.

22
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,750
And then I came back to the comedy store.

23
00:00:52,751 --> 00:00:56,040
I ate shit somewhere on Monday night
and I went to the economy's struck

24
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:56,320
Thursday.

25
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,840
They opened up with that suicide
joke that didn't take me very far

26
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:05,320
and then the second time I told him
the story about my friend who tried to

27
00:01:05,321 --> 00:01:06,131
commit suicide.

28
00:01:06,131 --> 00:01:09,580
She failed and she went up to the comedy
store and she bought a gram of coke

29
00:01:09,581 --> 00:01:12,220
from chewy and as we were doing it I said,

30
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:12,610
you know,

31
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:13,960
how did you get out of the crazy house?

32
00:01:13,961 --> 00:01:18,010
Then you try to kill yourself three
days ago and there was a big Graham,

33
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:18,970
it was one big line.

34
00:01:18,971 --> 00:01:19,900
She did the whole thing.

35
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,250
She looked at me and she goes,

36
00:01:21,251 --> 00:01:22,001
I ain't crazy.

37
00:01:22,001 --> 00:01:22,834
They let me out.

38
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:24,730
That was it.

39
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:27,390
I told that story that
we've got some last minute,

40
00:01:27,391 --> 00:01:30,790
one of them near in the rate and
the main home and I just died.

41
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:31,690
I had a fall delete.

42
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,553
I just died.

43
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:35,560
I just died a slow death
that was trying new stuff.

44
00:01:35,561 --> 00:01:36,700
I wasn't going nowhere.

45
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,460
I wanted to talk about
Trump and I just died.

46
00:01:39,461 --> 00:01:42,130
So Friday I went to the store
and I swear to God guys,

47
00:01:42,131 --> 00:01:43,360
I didn't eat nothing on that.

48
00:01:43,361 --> 00:01:44,740
Smoked some pot I worked at,

49
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:46,211
I went to the y,

50
00:01:46,211 --> 00:01:51,130
I did chest and the other thing I
smoked though before I left the house.

51
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:53,550
It was a little Brownie.

52
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:56,200
Let's 70 milligram brownies.

53
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,290
I have like maybe 13
cops left for the day.

54
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,030
I was fucking starving.

55
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,180
This little bong is right there.

56
00:02:04,181 --> 00:02:06,100
It was a half a pack
of an antiquey edible.

57
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,940
They give you two brownies each.

58
00:02:07,941 --> 00:02:10,250
Each at each Brownie is 70 milligrams.

59
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,190
That's so crazy scary.

60
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,330
I rub my balls are 70 milligrams.

61
00:02:14,331 --> 00:02:14,961
You understand me?

62
00:02:14,961 --> 00:02:16,880
70 milligrams for uncle
Joey is like an APP,

63
00:02:16,881 --> 00:02:18,200
but that's not going to parrot teeth.

64
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,930
It's not even a fuck you're
supplying to the rest of the world.

65
00:02:20,931 --> 00:02:23,450
70 milligrams of put
you into a fucking hole.

66
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:23,691
You know,

67
00:02:23,691 --> 00:02:25,310
I gave him a 500 last night.

68
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,553
We split,

69
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:30,163
we split a

70
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,140
thousand milligram edible roll
chain song down at the hall.

71
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:39,891
Oh my God.

72
00:02:39,891 --> 00:02:40,724
Listen to me.

73
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,400
We split it at three
o'clock in the afternoon.

74
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,510
Oh my God.

75
00:02:44,511 --> 00:02:49,511
What are you trying to prove by seven
o'clock I was so fucked by eight o'clock

76
00:02:50,571 --> 00:02:51,050
and you know,

77
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:52,970
usually when you eat your tame animal,

78
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:54,163
fuck no,

79
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,580
this turned on me.

80
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,480
This animal turn dog.

81
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:01,540
Sad Bitch beat me at the submissions.

82
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,820
At one point I had the cheese doodles.

83
00:03:03,821 --> 00:03:05,740
That belongs to the baby pirate's booty.

84
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:06,250
Yeah.

85
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,590
They were on the floor and they
were just coming out of my face.

86
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,760
I was just stuffing,

87
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,460
I was just stuffing pirate's
booty in my face and a path.

88
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,950
There was a bunch of
fruit and pirate's booty.

89
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,390
I couldn't stop.

90
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,940
I kept eating peaches and pirate's booty,

91
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:23,643
pirate's booty,

92
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,150
cantaloupe and pirate's booty.

93
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,680
I must've ate the whole baby.

94
00:03:26,681 --> 00:03:27,401
My wife was like,

95
00:03:27,401 --> 00:03:27,520
oh.

96
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,710
Cause I had my back turned to
them so they couldn't see me.

97
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:33,421
My wife's like,

98
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:34,930
what the fuck are you doing it?

99
00:03:34,931 --> 00:03:36,060
Then I go,

100
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:36,461
listen,

101
00:03:36,461 --> 00:03:37,191
I got to go to this bed.

102
00:03:37,191 --> 00:03:37,511
She goes,

103
00:03:37,511 --> 00:03:38,410
go to bed already.

104
00:03:38,411 --> 00:03:42,310
I went to 45 I slept off four I got up.

105
00:03:42,311 --> 00:03:42,911
I didn't know where.

106
00:03:42,911 --> 00:03:45,580
I was just laying at the
30 minutes like Mad Max.

107
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:46,571
I just laid,

108
00:03:46,571 --> 00:03:47,404
they'll come see you.

109
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,910
See for killing four in the morning
and didn't know where you were.

110
00:03:50,911 --> 00:03:53,750
So low 30 I woke up with a ton of energy,

111
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:54,941
energy.

112
00:03:54,941 --> 00:03:55,810
I wanted to shower.

113
00:03:55,811 --> 00:03:56,800
I washed the car,

114
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,120
I went for breakfast.

115
00:03:58,570 --> 00:03:59,500
I want to wash the car,

116
00:03:59,501 --> 00:04:00,510
and my wife had the upper bunk.

117
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,300
I taught stage God.

118
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:03,431
Oh my God.

119
00:04:03,431 --> 00:04:06,710
I was fucked up and I kept
calling me and saying,

120
00:04:06,711 --> 00:04:07,061
elite,

121
00:04:07,061 --> 00:04:08,850
if the cops coy don't answer the phone.

122
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:09,101
He goes,

123
00:04:09,101 --> 00:04:09,221
well,

124
00:04:09,221 --> 00:04:10,060
I haven't cops on the corner.

125
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:10,271
I got,

126
00:04:10,271 --> 00:04:10,511
I don't know,

127
00:04:10,511 --> 00:04:11,344
but they'll answer.

128
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,740
So funny.

129
00:04:13,741 --> 00:04:15,040
I just had it happen to you again though.

130
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,580
You ate too much at the comedy,

131
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:17,321
but last night,

132
00:04:17,321 --> 00:04:17,651
no,

133
00:04:17,651 --> 00:04:19,300
last night I didn't have anxiety guys.

134
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:19,901
Just what I'm saying.

135
00:04:19,901 --> 00:04:22,930
Thi 70 milligrams ain't Dick and my world.

136
00:04:22,931 --> 00:04:23,590
Okay,

137
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,360
so I eat the sudden milligrams.

138
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,190
I go down to Laurel Canyon.

139
00:04:27,191 --> 00:04:28,024
I hooked the right.

140
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,540
I go to the comedy store.

141
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:30,790
I pulled up no drama.

142
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,560
I get in Joe's upstairs.

143
00:04:32,561 --> 00:04:34,510
I don't even go upstairs because
I know the room was packed.

144
00:04:34,511 --> 00:04:35,344
I can't go upstairs,

145
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:37,090
so I'm alone at the comedy store.

146
00:04:37,091 --> 00:04:38,560
I went to the original image path.

147
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:39,940
I walk around with it,

148
00:04:39,941 --> 00:04:42,500
but I go into the VIP patio
and I just sit there some to,

149
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:43,480
to listen to music.

150
00:04:43,481 --> 00:04:44,800
Some black dude was smoking a joint.

151
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:45,700
I mind my business.

152
00:04:45,701 --> 00:04:46,570
I look straight ahead.

153
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,280
I'm thinking about more material.

154
00:04:48,281 --> 00:04:49,720
I'm going to say how I bombed.

155
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:51,760
It's just whipping me now,

156
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:52,180
right?

157
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,380
And I'm starting to get scared.

158
00:04:53,381 --> 00:04:53,621
I'm like,

159
00:04:53,621 --> 00:04:54,850
I really don't want to go on stage.

160
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:58,900
Jeff comes over to me and he goes,

161
00:04:58,901 --> 00:04:59,201
Joey,

162
00:04:59,201 --> 00:05:00,100
go on stage.

163
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,060
I walk over and say,

164
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,100
walk up the stairs.

165
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:04,780
It's a soul.room.

166
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:05,710
Megan Mooney,

167
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:07,661
Morgan Morgan,

168
00:05:07,661 --> 00:05:09,040
Morgan Murphys up on stage.

169
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,170
Fucking fucking,

170
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,100
I don't know what her fucking name.

171
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:16,010
She had a hat on and she was,

172
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,920
and she was texting her right now.

173
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,120
She was fucking killing,

174
00:05:19,121 --> 00:05:19,421
right?

175
00:05:19,421 --> 00:05:20,380
She's killing Megan.

176
00:05:20,381 --> 00:05:22,480
Move from whatever fucking name is Murphy.

177
00:05:22,481 --> 00:05:23,380
He brought the dog up.

178
00:05:23,381 --> 00:05:25,510
She was freaking me out and
then she's killing on stage.

179
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,410
I walk up to the first
landing guys and it hits me.

180
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,390
It's like,

181
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:31,931
oh my God,

182
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:33,130
I'm getting anxiety attack.

183
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,330
I'm 70 milligrams.

184
00:05:34,331 --> 00:05:35,050
Not,

185
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:35,501
not,

186
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:36,730
this can't be happening to me.

187
00:05:36,731 --> 00:05:37,570
This ain't happening.

188
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,480
And all the sudden I'm standing
there and it's getting worse.

189
00:05:40,481 --> 00:05:41,020
Guys,

190
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,780
it's getting worse now there's one
seat open at the whole comedy store,

191
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:45,130
this Mitsis jet.

192
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,560
So I sit in there for about a minute.

193
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,880
She's got the blue light on,

194
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:50,710
the pressure's on,

195
00:05:50,711 --> 00:05:51,910
I got water in my hand,

196
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,670
I get back up and it's getting worse.

197
00:05:54,671 --> 00:05:55,091
Guys.

198
00:05:55,091 --> 00:05:55,871
I turned around,

199
00:05:55,871 --> 00:06:00,350
I looked down to where the phone used
to be and now I'm getting the anxiety I

200
00:06:00,351 --> 00:06:01,610
get when I'm getting the needle,

201
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:02,930
which means I'm going down.

202
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,240
That's I gotta look for day light or air.

203
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,340
I know this like I look for air,

204
00:06:10,341 --> 00:06:12,170
but I know if I go down those stairs,

205
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:14,330
if she calls my name and I
come back up those stairs,

206
00:06:14,331 --> 00:06:15,650
I'm really going to
have an anxiety attack.

207
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,520
So I go to the corner and I just
started looking at the wall and I start

208
00:06:19,521 --> 00:06:21,550
breathing through my nose
and some guy comes up to me,

209
00:06:21,551 --> 00:06:21,750
said,

210
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:22,311
hey Joey,

211
00:06:22,311 --> 00:06:23,180
how are you doing man?

212
00:06:23,181 --> 00:06:23,721
What's going on?

213
00:06:23,721 --> 00:06:23,931
I go,

214
00:06:23,931 --> 00:06:25,280
not that I keep looking at the wall.

215
00:06:25,281 --> 00:06:26,840
He now he gets to have to walk away.

216
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,760
Then some other guy
pops out and he's like,

217
00:06:28,761 --> 00:06:29,594
Hey Joey,

218
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,940
I'm French is such and such.

219
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:31,701
He goes,

220
00:06:31,701 --> 00:06:32,481
do you know where he is?

221
00:06:32,481 --> 00:06:33,270
I don't give a fuck.

222
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,460
Why don't you see me staring at a fuck?

223
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:35,294
Don't walk the back.

224
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,020
Jeff comes up to me and I go,

225
00:06:39,021 --> 00:06:39,440
Jeff,

226
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,370
hold on one second.

227
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:40,641
General,

228
00:06:40,641 --> 00:06:41,474
I'm going to faint.

229
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,970
I got a really bad anxiety attack.

230
00:06:43,971 --> 00:06:44,860
I'm going down here.

231
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,340
Tell Pauli to go on stage.

232
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:48,380
And Jeff also wants to ask me questions.

233
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:49,400
He's like,

234
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:49,720
dude,

235
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,421
do you know if Paul,

236
00:06:50,421 --> 00:06:51,470
he's going to go up on stage.

237
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:52,400
I don't give a fuck.

238
00:06:52,401 --> 00:06:54,470
He's the closest person in stage.

239
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,450
She's about to call my name.

240
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:58,581
And all of a sudden he goes,

241
00:06:58,581 --> 00:06:58,701
well,

242
00:06:58,701 --> 00:06:59,361
let me go ask.

243
00:06:59,361 --> 00:07:01,190
I'm gonna fucking go ask him the fuck.

244
00:07:01,191 --> 00:07:02,510
I'm about to fucking faint now.

245
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,353
You gotta do this to me.

246
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:06,350
So he walks out with a ball and
he starts asking Paul and Paul,

247
00:07:06,351 --> 00:07:06,860
he's like,

248
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:10,100
and now they're getting into like a
conversation about it instead of polygon.

249
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:11,210
He's got an anxiety attack.

250
00:07:11,211 --> 00:07:12,044
Let me go up there.

251
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,430
I'm watching this go down.

252
00:07:13,431 --> 00:07:14,211
I get so angry.

253
00:07:14,211 --> 00:07:15,320
I go fucking guys on the hill.

254
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:16,260
What did Paul say?

255
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,480
Who the fuck knows what he said,

256
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:19,300
but instead of going to

257
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:22,090
go up red bank,

258
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:22,933
go up,

259
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,290
go up red band.

260
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:25,190
I got up my anxiety.

261
00:07:25,191 --> 00:07:25,550
You Go,

262
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,220
okay Joey and I'll worry about you later.

263
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:27,681
You okay?

264
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:28,310
Yeah.

265
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:28,881
Just go.

266
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:29,061
No.

267
00:07:29,061 --> 00:07:30,620
These guys have the conversation.

268
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:31,640
Bureaucracy.

269
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:33,560
I got so fucking language.

270
00:07:33,561 --> 00:07:33,861
Did I go?

271
00:07:33,861 --> 00:07:34,581
Fuck you guys.

272
00:07:34,581 --> 00:07:39,581
I'm going to go up and I want update Joe
Rogan to set up my life off of fear for

273
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:40,610
you.

274
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:43,460
I think I caught myself
at the 14 minute mark.

275
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:45,783
I just yell.

276
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,633
Did you record it?

277
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:47,151
No.

278
00:07:47,151 --> 00:07:48,260
Why would I do something like that?

279
00:07:48,261 --> 00:07:49,400
You don't have a fucking retard.

280
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,580
I fucked that one up
there and his joy low.

281
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:54,140
You know you'll never
hear me talking like this.

282
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:54,321
It was,

283
00:07:54,321 --> 00:07:54,950
yeah.

284
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:55,311
Oh,

285
00:07:55,311 --> 00:07:58,100
I'm fear and I remember
walking out of there,

286
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:58,371
man,

287
00:07:58,371 --> 00:07:59,620
I got in that car and Paul,

288
00:07:59,621 --> 00:08:00,080
he goes,

289
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:00,321
man,

290
00:08:00,321 --> 00:08:02,290
you shouldn't have anxiety
attacks more often than,

291
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,270
and I was like,

292
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:05,600
I was fucking dying.

293
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,040
Oh,

294
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,270
okay.

295
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:10,340
You have Mitsis voice when you
do the impression appalling.

296
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:15,160
The same say Boise.

297
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:16,250
Do when you do Mitzi?

298
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,300
Like all this shores
share one Joey Diaz voice.

299
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:29,140
Okay.
