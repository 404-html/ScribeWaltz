1
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:19,530
Jamie too hot in here.
Turn the AC up.

2
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,230
That bitch get it down to zero.

3
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:27,810
My man.
What's happening baby?

4
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:29,910
Welcome back.
Brought notes.

5
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,340
Yeah.
Just a couple of notes.

6
00:00:32,341 --> 00:00:36,870
I don't want to repeat myself since the
last time because you're the only guest

7
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,380
ever in the history of this podcast that
is brought notes to make sure they don't

8
00:00:40,381 --> 00:00:41,690
repeat themselves.
Yes.

9
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,520
They say it's the first time I do a
podcast.

10
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:49,550
This like or any other interview I never
go programmed or premeditated or

11
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,830
prepared whatsoever.
Just jump in,

12
00:00:52,831 --> 00:00:57,831
but I think this is much more important.
It's Joe Rogan man and the ice man man.

13
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,320
And you are a big window and I'm still
on the mission trying to get it out to

14
00:01:05,611 --> 00:01:10,190
everybody that we are able to do so much
more and uh,

15
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,690
you know,
it's all natural what we do.

16
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,640
So there is no money attached to it and
uh,

17
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,590
it's a,
it's a struggle to get it out there,

18
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:25,130
but we get more and more scientific
evidence a piling up.

19
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:30,750
And I'm here to present new insight.
Well,

20
00:01:30,751 --> 00:01:33,600
I think you're winning a struggle for
sure because I hear about you all the

21
00:01:33,601 --> 00:01:35,700
time.
I hear about you all the time for people

22
00:01:35,701 --> 00:01:37,250
that have heard about you from my
podcast,

23
00:01:37,251 --> 00:01:38,820
when people that say,
do you know this guy?

24
00:01:38,821 --> 00:01:39,511
And I say,
yeah,

25
00:01:39,511 --> 00:01:40,900
he's been on my podcast.
I know.

26
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,470
So the message is getting out 100
percent.

27
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,260
Wow.
That's a bio parameter for me.

28
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,800
Thanks for sharing that.
I will take it though,

29
00:01:49,801 --> 00:01:51,040
don't you?
Oh yeah.

30
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,480
At this morning I was talking to Tony
Robins.

31
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,770
Oh Shit.
And he wants to cooperate on that shit.

32
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,410
Yeah.
And uh,

33
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:05,411
and now I'm Joe with Joe again.
I mean those are big names and uh,

34
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:09,660
I to listen to Tony Robbins tapes when I
was 20,

35
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,100
20 or 21 when I was a struggling standup
comedian.

36
00:02:13,101 --> 00:02:15,120
He used to listen to is what was it
called?

37
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,670
Unlimited power.
Is that what it was?

38
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:18,210
Was an audio cassette and I listened to
it.

39
00:02:18,211 --> 00:02:21,990
One was old school walkman thing.
Big chunky things.

40
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:22,843
Yeah,
yeah,

41
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:23,431
yeah,
yeah,

42
00:02:23,431 --> 00:02:25,110
yeah.
And uh,

43
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:30,111
yeah,
he's got to his goal charity to get 100

44
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,470
million meals together this year and I'm
going to help them.

45
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,830
That's great.
What is he doing to that?

46
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,680
Just raising money and awareness,
raising money and to buy,

47
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:46,160
give a billionaire some very powerful
people who are very good insights in

48
00:02:46,411 --> 00:02:50,410
their own stressful lives.
And uh,

49
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:55,610
I'm in there to teach them how to handle
stress hormone at the deepest in the

50
00:02:57,721 --> 00:02:59,800
brain as in the,
in the body.

51
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:00,693
Beautiful.

52
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,560
You know,
I had a friend of mine who was trying to

53
00:03:02,561 --> 00:03:07,180
do a parody on Tony Robbins,
so he went and researched him and he was

54
00:03:07,181 --> 00:03:09,490
going to listen to some of his
recordings and listen to some of his

55
00:03:09,491 --> 00:03:13,330
speeches.
And his goal was to find what's stupid

56
00:03:13,331 --> 00:03:14,880
about it.
And then he started going like,

57
00:03:14,881 --> 00:03:16,140
God damn,
this guy is honest.

58
00:03:16,141 --> 00:03:17,030
And that was it.
Calvin,

59
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,710
do you remember who it was?
They were talking about it in here.

60
00:03:20,711 --> 00:03:23,680
I believe it was calvin.
I think he was researching him for

61
00:03:23,681 --> 00:03:26,080
something that he was doing.
And then along the way started realizing

62
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:27,820
like,
this guy's fucking legit,

63
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,500
but he's one of the rare ones,
like almost everyone.

64
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:36,180
That's like a professional motivator.
Then you go behind and go,

65
00:03:36,181 --> 00:03:37,450
okay,
well what do you do?

66
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,400
You know,
like what do you do?

67
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,800
You just motivate people.
Have you had done anything?

68
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,900
Like you're telling people they can go
do things,

69
00:03:43,901 --> 00:03:46,470
but what the fuck have you done?
What have you done sir?

70
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,820
And most of them,
they don't do shit.

71
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,380
They just get together with big
seminars.

72
00:03:51,381 --> 00:03:53,050
They tell people they can do it,
you can do it.

73
00:03:53,051 --> 00:03:54,130
Like fuck,
I can do it now.

74
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:55,660
But you never go,
hey man,

75
00:03:55,661 --> 00:03:58,690
what have you done?
You on the other hand,

76
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,280
yeah,
you've done a lot of shit.

77
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,240
So it's one thing when people say,
well that,

78
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,080
that ice man Hoff Guy,
is he legit?

79
00:04:05,081 --> 00:04:05,914
I'm like,
bitch,

80
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:10,120
do you have wikipedia?
Do you google?

81
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,840
Well we have the live and uh,
coming,

82
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,430
uh,
January,

83
00:04:16,431 --> 00:04:18,120
we're going to do Kilimanjaro.
Yeah,

84
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,180
man,
you already offered that optimum shoot.

85
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:24,590
You shoot going to Kilimanjaro.
Hey man,

86
00:04:24,591 --> 00:04:27,190
kill a man.
Know

87
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:31,390
anyone from afar,
from Los Angeles while watching

88
00:04:31,391 --> 00:04:33,220
television,
I'll be live tweeting it

89
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:38,640
right on.
Right now we're doing a scientific

90
00:04:38,641 --> 00:04:43,641
research and show that the rat cell
generation can be accelerated if it is

91
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:49,791
so in those circumstances than signs has
to update the circumstances where their

92
00:04:52,231 --> 00:04:55,650
cells can be regenerated is like in 24
hours,

93
00:04:55,651 --> 00:04:59,730
the body is not able to adapt to the
circumstances where there is a lack of

94
00:04:59,731 --> 00:05:04,110
oxygen is half the oxygen nonetheless.
And we go into the altitude on

95
00:05:04,111 --> 00:05:08,670
Kilimanjaro is a six,
like 20,000 feet at the top,

96
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:13,720
so to say 15,000 feet.
The acclimatization,

97
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:17,880
the adaptation is not as fast in human
bodies.

98
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:23,120
Now we found his breathing techniques
and using the mind and that enabled us

99
00:05:24,121 --> 00:05:26,940
to accelerate that,
what they thought,

100
00:05:26,941 --> 00:05:28,980
what signs is thinking that,
uh,

101
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:33,990
that it is arranged.
I'll autonomously so outside of our will

102
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:38,220
and we cannot interfere.
We cannot intervene now.

103
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:43,700
So we will show that with like 30 people
by the way,

104
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
past January I did it with a person 76
years old without a prior mountaineering

105
00:05:51,901 --> 00:05:54,570
experience.
And he did it in 44 hours.

106
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:56,240
Don't 76,
uh,

107
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,340
I mean a,
that's a robust 76

108
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:02,660
year old,
but he was a good guy that will burn

109
00:06:02,661 --> 00:06:06,470
brightly for the last couple of days.
His old life is dead,

110
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,140
really transferred.
So,

111
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,430
um,
let me ask you this.

112
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:15,520
So the standard model of what someone
can do as far as how much red so red

113
00:06:16,341 --> 00:06:20,510
blood cells they can generate is
observed and they thought that it was at

114
00:06:20,511 --> 00:06:25,340
15,000 feet it became too difficult.
But you've shown that with your

115
00:06:25,341 --> 00:06:29,270
exercises and when your deep breathing
techniques that you can actually

116
00:06:29,271 --> 00:06:34,271
accelerate red blood cell count on
consciously or at least not consciously

117
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,920
with your,
your through conscious action,

118
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:41,300
conscious action using the breath,
but what techniques are you using the

119
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:45,890
same what we did last time,
but then adapt it to while you are

120
00:06:45,891 --> 00:06:50,891
walking and when a first sign of ams,
lack of oxygen into hat means headache,

121
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:56,700
a Mss,
acute mountain sickness and the first

122
00:06:56,710 --> 00:07:00,680
sinus headache and that means a lack of
oxygen inside the brain.

123
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:05,060
Normally we are not able to get oxygen
then at that moment,

124
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,510
inside the brain to equal the violence
that violence,

125
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,590
the lack of oxygen.
And uh,

126
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:15,320
I've learned to just to do that.
So we tackled the problem and keep on

127
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:20,210
able to perform in the extreme
conditions even so through this

128
00:07:20,211 --> 00:07:23,300
technique of taking these enormous deep
breaths,

129
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:27,110
letting some of it out and then trying
to refill and then letting some of it

130
00:07:27,111 --> 00:07:28,430
out,
trying to refill,

131
00:07:28,431 --> 00:07:33,431
letting some of it out.
And then you're forcing your body to

132
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:37,790
your forcing your lungs to constantly
carry air.

133
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,800
Yes.
Uh,

134
00:07:39,801 --> 00:07:41,120
uh,
that it is,

135
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:45,740
we use the youngsters to passage way,
but it gets into the lymphatic system.

136
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:48,020
It gets into the tissue.
You know,

137
00:07:48,021 --> 00:07:53,021
what we just found with the university
and in Germany they found out that the

138
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:58,270
devices that showed that we have 100
percent blood saturation,

139
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:03,290
oxygen in the blood is not 100 percent.

140
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:07,670
We go more.
They found it out for the thought was

141
00:08:07,671 --> 00:08:10,730
100 percent blood saturation.
There's actually a higher level above

142
00:08:10,731 --> 00:08:11,810
that.
Yes.

143
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:16,400
And that's what I always sad,
but now it says it's like proven.

144
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:20,810
So what they thought was 100 percent
blood saturation was just based on what

145
00:08:20,811 --> 00:08:24,520
people normally do with no extra
techniques involved.

146
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,360
Is that what it is?
Absolutely.

147
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:31,390
Based on that they made devices and then
a 100 percent saturation in the blood is

148
00:08:32,301 --> 00:08:37,301
100 percent and then you should be like
sane.

149
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,590
But now we've got this professor,
a biochemical professor.

150
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:43,500
Uh,
uh,

151
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,180
whatever his name,
Mr. Ms Dot Keith.

152
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:47,460
Doesn't matter.
Professor miscut at East.

153
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,390
Given the name.
Fuck it.

154
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:50,480
Yeah.
Like mosquito.

155
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:53,570
What a name.
A professor.

156
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,200
Yeah.
A professor,

157
00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:02,210
fly professor mosquito,
this biochemical professor and he

158
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:05,300
telled,
uh,

159
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,700
looking at the results,
what you have produced with the

160
00:09:07,701 --> 00:09:12,701
university regarding to the immune
system and influencing intuity

161
00:09:12,901 --> 00:09:15,690
autonomous nervous system.
We can say,

162
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:19,140
uh,
you guys have found a way to tap into

163
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:23,580
the tissue,
into the lymphatic system and take away

164
00:09:23,581 --> 00:09:26,610
the acidity over there.
And uh,

165
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:30,780
and the storage capacity of the
lymphatic system at that deeper level

166
00:09:30,781 --> 00:09:35,781
than the blood is actually a storage
capacity to have chemistry.

167
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,513
Uh,
uh,

168
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:43,610
which is wrong as taught up over there
so it doesn't mess with a rest of the

169
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,280
physiology to maintain functionality.
So,

170
00:09:47,281 --> 00:09:52,281
but in time you got to deal with it.
It's like garbage and at garbage we

171
00:09:52,321 --> 00:09:55,530
could not tap into that.
And I'm so confused.

172
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:59,430
So what is that garbage?
The garbage is a wrong chemistry.

173
00:09:59,431 --> 00:10:00,800
You like be a,
uh,

174
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:05,900
an acidic state of chemistry in the
lymphatic system as well.

175
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:07,840
Do they,
do they know what that.

176
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,140
I mean,
have they isolated that as is on an

177
00:10:10,141 --> 00:10:12,330
actual compound?
Can I tell you what it is that they are

178
00:10:12,331 --> 00:10:13,740
monitoring?
Yes.

179
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:18,990
It's actually a,
that acidity chronically,

180
00:10:18,991 --> 00:10:22,800
they're not being dealt with.
This professor,

181
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:27,840
my biomedical professor tells us that a
95 percent of the auto immune diseases,

182
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,600
of course,
because of it,

183
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:37,370
so 95 percent of autoimmune diseases are
caused by some sort of acidity,

184
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:42,420
long term,
a long time presence of acidity not

185
00:10:42,421 --> 00:10:46,500
being dealt with.
We'll deal with you in the end and

186
00:10:46,501 --> 00:10:48,960
deregulate,
say the chemistry in the rest of the

187
00:10:48,961 --> 00:10:52,200
body.
The biochemical processes actually does

188
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:54,180
quite logic,
logical,

189
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,540
but we.
And he knew he knew that,

190
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:02,160
but then we came up with this.
What is the cause of this acidity?

191
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,260
Is it diabetes?
Is a stress based?

192
00:11:04,261 --> 00:11:05,720
Is it all the above?
Yes.

193
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:09,900
Anything that is stress too much we can
handle.

194
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:14,270
So Diet like inflammation,
stress as far as pressure,

195
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:18,460
life,
any stress we are not able to deal with

196
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:23,310
will be translated into chemistry.
And as you are not dealing with it,

197
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:26,940
it will be stored.
That might stop you right here because

198
00:11:26,941 --> 00:11:28,170
for a lot of people that are listening
to this,

199
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:31,320
like,
what the fuck is Joe Rogan doing on this

200
00:11:31,321 --> 00:11:34,740
podcast?
What the hell does about you are very

201
00:11:34,741 --> 00:11:39,600
unique in that your claims are
incredibly unusual but substantiated by

202
00:11:39,601 --> 00:11:42,470
science and this is not,
um,

203
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:47,560
is not woo science that this is real
legitimate researchers have they

204
00:11:48,151 --> 00:11:50,640
injected you with what was it they
injected you with,

205
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,580
with an ICO,
live bacteria and endotoxemia and

206
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:57,970
endotoxin.
And then they monitored your immune

207
00:11:57,971 --> 00:12:02,971
system and saw that you could actively
force your immune system to fight off

208
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:07,750
this injection.
Very specifically within a quarter of

209
00:12:07,751 --> 00:12:10,180
our.
And this is something they did not think

210
00:12:10,181 --> 00:12:12,220
was possible until you perform this.

211
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:16,030
Exactly.
They saw that I was influencing intuity,

212
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,010
so-called autonomous nervous system.
And then for also for people that did

213
00:12:21,011 --> 00:12:23,920
not hear the first podcast you have
achieved.

214
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,670
I believe it's correct if I'm wrong.
20 six world records,

215
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:31,840
six,
including you have the longest time of

216
00:12:31,841 --> 00:12:36,841
holding your breath and swimming under a
under ice ocean.

217
00:12:36,861 --> 00:12:37,720
Nice too,
right?

218
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:38,241
Yeah.
So.

219
00:12:38,241 --> 00:12:41,950
Oh Shit.
This is fucking incredibly cold water.

220
00:12:41,951 --> 00:12:43,600
We're saltwater freezes over,
right?

221
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:48,400
Yes.
And you ran marathons basically in your

222
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:53,401
underwear with in his shorts and they
say beyond mit winter.

223
00:12:53,411 --> 00:12:55,240
Yeah.
Beyond the desert.

224
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:56,650
Without drinking.
Yes.

225
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:01,890
No Mater of training because I don't
like running too much and I just do it.

226
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:05,800
Just do it.
It's like when your house is on fire,

227
00:13:05,801 --> 00:13:07,120
you run fast,
right?

228
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,580
You don't need to train them.
Right.

229
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,920
And so I know how to tap into this
adrenaline,

230
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:18,130
a system,
the access it debris,

231
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,510
brainstem to reptilian mode.

232
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,500
I've learned that.
Well I have a lot of friends that have

233
00:13:23,501 --> 00:13:26,260
followed your course.
Now my girlfriend denny,

234
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:29,290
apparently it was just with you this
past weekend in San Francisco,

235
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:32,630
denny provost,
he's a Brazilian jujitsu world champion,

236
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:36,340
or a good friend of mine and a really
interesting guy.

237
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:38,410
He loves your stuff.
And uh,

238
00:13:38,411 --> 00:13:40,180
he's,
he's fascinated by it.

239
00:13:40,181 --> 00:13:42,130
I know a lot of other people that are
fascinated by too,

240
00:13:42,131 --> 00:13:45,200
a lot of people that I know that it
taking your course and trying your stuff

241
00:13:45,201 --> 00:13:48,040
since the last time you were on.
So anybody who's listened to this

242
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:50,530
podcast for the first time,
you might want to go back and listen to

243
00:13:50,531 --> 00:13:54,040
the first one and we go into great
detail about all the different

244
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,840
accomplishments that you've made with
your method,

245
00:13:55,841 --> 00:13:57,750
the Wim Hof breathing method.
Um,

246
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,740
so in case you're listening to this for
the first time,

247
00:13:59,741 --> 00:14:01,060
you're like,
why the fuck is this?

248
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,710
You know,
that's that it is again,

249
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:07,280
legit.
It's a legit Alegent,

250
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:11,330
uh,
and a legit.

251
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,690
And yeah,
we are legends.

252
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:15,480
Yes,
a legendary because we go pause,

253
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:20,320
perceive limits.
We go past the fear and what we perceive

254
00:14:20,321 --> 00:14:23,820
as being possible.
We go past that because we pioneered,

255
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:26,830
we go past.
I would feel created by our

256
00:14:26,831 --> 00:14:30,370
conditioning,
whatever we think is possible,

257
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:34,110
and we do not dare to go past that.
Well,

258
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:34,720
it's funny,
the.

259
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,150
I'm sorry I didn't ever really do,
but it's funny that your teammate was

260
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,040
Anthony Robbins because you hear the
Anthony Robbins.

261
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,690
Anthony Robbins loves to do those,
uh,

262
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:44,080
walking on fire things.
But uh,

263
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:47,850
lately it's been causing problems
because people pause in the middle and

264
00:14:47,851 --> 00:14:50,260
take selfies and then they want to burn
their feet.

265
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:52,010
Silly

266
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:55,280
people.
So silly.

267
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,550
But uh,
we had Michael Shermer on who's a noted

268
00:14:58,551 --> 00:15:00,810
skeptic and very,
very intelligent man.

269
00:15:00,811 --> 00:15:03,810
And he explained what what it is,
is that,

270
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:05,840
you know,
the coals are very poor conductor of

271
00:15:05,841 --> 00:15:07,520
heat.
That's why you don't cook right on

272
00:15:07,521 --> 00:15:08,720
coals.
You use metal.

273
00:15:08,721 --> 00:15:11,330
Metal's a great conductor of heat,
but the metal over the coals,

274
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:14,810
the metal gets heated up by the Kohl's.
And that sears your food.

275
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:19,430
You don't cook on Kohl's themselves
because it doesn't really transmit heat

276
00:15:19,431 --> 00:15:20,810
that well.
That's why you can,

277
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:23,530
for 10 seconds or so,
you can walk over and real quick and you

278
00:15:23,531 --> 00:15:25,860
don't really get that burned unless you
pause for selfies.

279
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:27,760
Yes,
yes,

280
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:31,170
uh,
I mean I go back to nature and then you

281
00:15:31,171 --> 00:15:36,171
see before we wore his shoes actually
ridiculous things,

282
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:41,790
but we invented them and now we think
with a shiny shoes we have so much more

283
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:42,624
beautiful.
Right?

284
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
But shoes do look good though.
Choose to and they're colorful shoes and

285
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:53,481
all that.
Very nice but sometimes be more over

286
00:15:53,671 --> 00:15:56,640
because of all these devices,
radiation,

287
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,140
we get to,
into the nervous system and we charged

288
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:04,200
with negative ions and for that,
you know,

289
00:16:04,201 --> 00:16:08,300
any electricity you need to ground if
you've got big charts,

290
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:13,301
so it accumulate in the body and
therefore I suggest people walk

291
00:16:14,521 --> 00:16:17,760
sometimes just inside of nature now the
all day,

292
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:22,140
but the release,
those negative ions are going to write

293
00:16:22,141 --> 00:16:23,600
something down because I keep forgetting
it.

294
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,130
Is that true though,

295
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:32,460
like as far as a negative ions and doing
things to your body,

296
00:16:33,661 --> 00:16:38,200
have they ever found any correlation
between the use of electronics and

297
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,310
negative aspects?

298
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,600
I just feel to you.
You think so?

299
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:46,720
I always go by my intuition.
I thinks at teacher won't approve it,

300
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:51,220
but I feel a lot better doing this.
I'm going to do to Kilimanjaro by the

301
00:16:51,221 --> 00:16:52,360
way,
on a bad foot.

302
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:56,060
Oh yeah.
Man likes a challenge.

303
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:58,130
I have a friend of mine who went to
Bolivia.

304
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,680
He filmed,
he has a television show called

305
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:02,150
mediator.
His name is Stephen [inaudible].

306
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:07,300
He's a professional hunter and he went
to Bolivia and he lived with the Toumani

307
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,580
for a couple weeks and he brought them
shoes like,

308
00:17:10,581 --> 00:17:11,030
hey,
you know,

309
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,160
hey,
try these shoes on that.

310
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,750
They didn't want to have nothing to do
with those shoes,

311
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:17,210
like stupid things out of here because
those people walk barefoot everywhere

312
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:19,940
and their feet.
He said their feet don't look at

313
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,320
anybody's feet.
He's like,

314
00:17:21,321 --> 00:17:24,800
they're all splayed out like their toes
are splayed out and there's like a

315
00:17:24,801 --> 00:17:27,320
thick,
thick padding underneath.

316
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,360
You know,
where they're basically have their own

317
00:17:29,361 --> 00:17:31,760
shoes,
like the calluses and the bottom of

318
00:17:31,761 --> 00:17:33,350
their feet.
Act as shoes.

319
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:37,790
That doesn't sound too attractive for me
to.

320
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:42,870
To have to attract abby,
to have feed like a heart and know what

321
00:17:46,261 --> 00:17:50,280
I do is using my mind.
So you don't want to have callouses on

322
00:17:50,281 --> 00:17:51,270
the bottom of your feet.
From what?

323
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:54,150
I got very soft baby feet.
So you really.

324
00:17:54,151 --> 00:17:55,050
Yeah,
yeah,

325
00:17:55,051 --> 00:17:59,270
yeah.
My wife always does a self defeating

326
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:06,420
man.
So you are going to do this barefoot.

327
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,910
Are you gonna wear shoes at least?
No,

328
00:18:08,911 --> 00:18:09,181
no,
no,

329
00:18:09,181 --> 00:18:10,580
no.
Not paying like that.

330
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:15,060
Your colleges to go once again,
mind over matter.

331
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,830
Well,
what about frostbite?

332
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:20,580
And I did the half marathon,
barefoot.

333
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:25,760
You did beyond the Polish circles in
temperatures even far more below than

334
00:18:25,821 --> 00:18:28,560
the Kilimanjaro is.
Is it?

335
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:32,640
Do you think that's possible?
There's any benefit from the fact that

336
00:18:32,641 --> 00:18:36,360
you're walking so much or running and
then your body is heating up and maybe

337
00:18:36,361 --> 00:18:38,730
that has a positive effect on your skin.

338
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:42,450
Um,
the thing is I'm very able to,

339
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:45,480
uh,
to go away and to tap into the hormonal

340
00:18:45,481 --> 00:18:49,890
system creating adrenaline.
You know,

341
00:18:49,891 --> 00:18:53,430
this fact where people are sometimes
refer to,

342
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:59,030
they lift up and mother because the
child is underneath that actually is the

343
00:18:59,311 --> 00:19:03,390
mind staring directly into the reptilian
mode.

344
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,730
The reptilian brain,
which is the primitive brain and that

345
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:12,030
you have direct access to pure
adrenaline,

346
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:17,210
makes you able to do almost
inconceivable a feet and accomplish it.

347
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:21,120
Only one tear right trigger.
Now,

348
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,460
because I have been so much into the
cold,

349
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:28,740
cold is cold,
is a real force impact upon you,

350
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:34,080
so you need to learn how to connect
within with your mind and you're

351
00:19:34,081 --> 00:19:37,320
breathing into the brainstem,
into this adrenaline,

352
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,320
to withstand this force.
The cold impact.

353
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:43,320
I've learned it so you're tapping in
your brain,

354
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:48,060
you're causing your body to produce more
adrenaline and you're focusing on the

355
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:50,370
areas of your body that are contacting
the snow,

356
00:19:50,371 --> 00:19:52,170
like you're focusing on the bottom of
your feet.

357
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,310
Yes,
yes.

358
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,690
And it works.
You know,

359
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:59,840
I'm still able to look around now it's
the sunset or the sunrise and and be.

360
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,300
So there is a margin even there,
right?

361
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:08,520
We just need to go back to belief and
unbelief.

362
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:11,790
There in means the neurotransmitters and
the neurons.

363
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:17,150
Those are signals and say churches.
So if you charge a,

364
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:23,100
a buddy,
then if you're able to influence up to

365
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:28,980
DNA level,
and we have proven this already,

366
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:34,400
but the aisle six enter location
connected to safe inflammation,

367
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:39,130
we could not find it off,
we could not suppressed decide to cast

368
00:20:39,131 --> 00:20:43,480
the flammatory markers and we showed
very effectively not me,

369
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:47,770
only a whole group of persons which are
trained just four days

370
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:53,100
to be able to go into the DNA and create
the right chemistry consciously by

371
00:20:54,281 --> 00:20:59,281
breathing and using the mind to fend off
flammatory markers a caused by,

372
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:06,540
say a bacteria inside.
So we are actually able to tap into the

373
00:21:07,751 --> 00:21:10,970
deepest of ours,
create a,

374
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:15,990
have control over adrenaline's trestle
and go up to not only in the deepest

375
00:21:16,271 --> 00:21:19,150
part of the brain but also in the DNA.
And um,

376
00:21:19,151 --> 00:21:20,950
I,
I got interesting thing.

377
00:21:20,951 --> 00:21:23,650
So let me ask you this.
The last time I believe you,

378
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:26,950
you've got a pile of notes.
What is it about breathing?

379
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:29,440
What is it about breathing or his
breathing?

380
00:21:29,441 --> 00:21:33,460
Just one component of this.
Is it breathing and also focusing on

381
00:21:33,461 --> 00:21:35,200
what you're trying to accomplish?
Yeah,

382
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:38,920
focus absolutely works.
Let me explain a little about,

383
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:40,390
uh,
about breathing.

384
00:21:40,391 --> 00:21:43,720
Breathing is chemistry.
Oxygen has chemistry in the body,

385
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:49,470
so if y'all are able to access,
energize the cells more than we do

386
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:53,710
normally because we talked about the
lymphatic system and the tissue,

387
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:59,130
and actually the body's able to store up
more oxygen than the 100 percent.

388
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:03,230
We presumed a,
uh,

389
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,500
possible.
Scientifically,

390
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:10,240
we are able to store up more oxygen.
So Eva breathing technique,

391
00:22:10,241 --> 00:22:15,241
whatever breathing technique is able to
store up more oxygen in the south,

392
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:18,970
that means go into the tissue going into
the lymphatic system.

393
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,340
Then suddenly the,
Eh,

394
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:26,341
the chemistry becomes alkaline.
The asset gets out of the body at will,

395
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:30,610
and then the mind,
the mind is positive,

396
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,330
a little electrical charges,
neurotransmitters,

397
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:39,870
and they are suddenly able to connect in
a buddy and you enabling you to have

398
00:22:42,311 --> 00:22:45,610
control,
direct all the systems in the body.

399
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:50,880
That's the way nature Amanda to be.
So the mind a mind is conditioned to be

400
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:54,970
effective in the body is making the
body,

401
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:56,710
uh,
by breath,

402
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,740
right,
breathing profound breathing in an

403
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:03,430
alkaline state.
Then these electrical signals are able

404
00:23:03,431 --> 00:23:08,431
to travel through out and the way nature
meant it to be is that we are able to

405
00:23:08,471 --> 00:23:12,820
direct any part of the body,
so the immune system,

406
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:15,490
endocrine system,
the lymphatic system,

407
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:20,140
vasculars older systems where we told a
little bit last time,

408
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:25,060
but I got more direct evidence now and
right now we are working with the

409
00:23:25,061 --> 00:23:30,061
universities on the brain and say
emotional reactivity and they see

410
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:36,300
incredible things that we actually are
able to get into those places where

411
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:40,420
emotion exists and we think emotion.

412
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:41,620
Where is it,
where is it,

413
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:46,950
but at this translated also as something
chemical so they can measure motion and

414
00:23:47,901 --> 00:23:49,170
the chemical form.
Yes.

415
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:51,030
What are they?
What are they measuring it?

416
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:54,530
They they go into say a,
the hypothalamus,

417
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:57,440
hypothalamus,
hippocampus,

418
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,160
Amygdala.
Those are the places where this

419
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:04,400
chemistry is going on and we had no way
to get into that.

420
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:07,850
Now,
if you are able to access those parts

421
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:12,050
and to pressurize with breathing
techniques into those parts,

422
00:24:12,051 --> 00:24:16,280
then suddenly you feel you begin to cry.
Why?

423
00:24:16,281 --> 00:24:20,390
Because the chemistry is changing.
You are dealing with the chemistry which

424
00:24:20,391 --> 00:24:25,391
was stored up because she couldn't work
it up before and now you're able to tap

425
00:24:25,851 --> 00:24:28,070
in there,
change the chemistry,

426
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:30,790
and that that's the function.
Uh,

427
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:35,830
you are not able to deal with it now.
So later when you have peace and you are

428
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:39,800
a somewhere no,
not stressful,

429
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:43,150
then work on it and breathing does it.

430
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:48,640
It brought into it positively influences
the chemistry in the,

431
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:51,560
in the depth of the brain.
You know,

432
00:24:51,561 --> 00:24:56,561
what happens?
You create 25 percent more blood flow

433
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:01,130
and blood flow is with oxygen through,
through your breathing.

434
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,350
Yes.
Well,

435
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,280
it makes sense because your blood is
being.

436
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,110
It's carrying oxygen,
right?

437
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:09,830
So the more oxygen you provide your
blood and you are definitely providing

438
00:25:09,831 --> 00:25:13,520
it more with these big long,
deep breaths and these techniques that

439
00:25:13,521 --> 00:25:15,200
you,
that you pursue.

440
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:18,350
Yes,
manipulating the spine,

441
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:22,870
the central nervous system up to the
tunnel of the light or the brain.

442
00:25:22,871 --> 00:25:27,830
Stem is a top.
So if your pressure rise after inhaling,

443
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:31,310
exhaling like we did last time,
you did about three minutes,

444
00:25:31,311 --> 00:25:34,370
almost a without in the lungs.
Very good.

445
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:39,380
First round is very promising for the
next rounds because you get more and

446
00:25:39,381 --> 00:25:43,340
more oxygen,
it only to show that you are able to

447
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:47,840
store up oxygen far more than you ever
used before,

448
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:52,910
so in case when you need it to regulate
the chemistry inside the body,

449
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:54,650
then it needs oxygen.

450
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:59,680
Then you we are all able with these
breathing exercises to get it anywhere

451
00:26:00,171 --> 00:26:05,171
where the chemistry is messed up and a
chemistry messed up,

452
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:10,660
we'll send off a signal,
but we are not emotionally not listening

453
00:26:10,821 --> 00:26:15,350
because we get a worries and we need to
do the deadline and this and that so we

454
00:26:15,351 --> 00:26:20,351
are not a chemistry stays over there and
will deregulate the system and then we

455
00:26:23,301 --> 00:26:25,490
become sick and we don't know what's
happening.

456
00:26:25,491 --> 00:26:30,491
We go to the doctor and a psychiatrist
because we become depressed and all,

457
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:37,300
but we are very able to get into any
place in the body and in this case,

458
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:44,220
the brain where we do all these studies

459
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:49,220
now with the university.
They say cognitive therapy just talking

460
00:26:49,591 --> 00:26:52,950
to each other in the psychology and
psychotherapy.

461
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:57,240
That's not enough.
That was a conference with 200 experts

462
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,270
and they did this breathing and then
they say,

463
00:27:00,271 --> 00:27:01,150
oh,
wow,

464
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:05,070
yeah,
talking a only as not enough,

465
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:09,300
but if you do this breathing,
then you really get into the brain.

466
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:13,860
Now suddenly you get a sense of control
because you're creating this extra

467
00:27:13,861 --> 00:27:17,580
circulation of blood,
yes to together with oxygen,

468
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:22,200
making it alkaline.
Then suddenly the blockage is created

469
00:27:22,201 --> 00:27:26,340
because of wrong chemistry because of
trauma or uh,

470
00:27:26,341 --> 00:27:29,640
uh,
anxiety or grief.

471
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:35,150
Then suddenly that chemistry is being
dealt with and you get balanced.

472
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,180
[inaudible] simple,
and we keep it simple.

473
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:40,690
Uh,
and,

474
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:44,190
and,
and try to get this web of our thoughts

475
00:27:44,191 --> 00:27:47,490
thinking of so many difficulties and
complications.

476
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:49,590
What is emotion?
What is fair?

477
00:27:49,591 --> 00:27:51,870
What is PTSD?
What is trauma?

478
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:55,020
What is depression?
We don't know where it is in the brain.

479
00:27:55,290 --> 00:28:00,290
Just get all the brain full of oxygen,
get get to alkalinity up and you are

480
00:28:01,591 --> 00:28:04,800
able to steer by going through the
spine,

481
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:08,100
up in your head and do it all.
Is that.

482
00:28:08,101 --> 00:28:11,340
Why do you believe?
Is that why some studies have shown that

483
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,550
rigorous exercise,
particularly cardio like running a

484
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:17,640
elliptical machines,
things along those lines are just as

485
00:28:17,641 --> 00:28:21,300
good for depression as medication?
Absolutely.

486
00:28:21,301 --> 00:28:22,160
Absolutely.
It,

487
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:27,790
it's dealing with the oxygen tension is
forcing when you think those giant deep

488
00:28:28,321 --> 00:28:30,360
breaths you take when you're jogging or
something.

489
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:31,493
Yes,
I do.

490
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:36,980
When you do those things to you actually
create the body to be effective with the

491
00:28:39,271 --> 00:28:42,420
oxygen,
then suddenly different mechanisms are

492
00:28:42,421 --> 00:28:43,670
at work.
Uh,

493
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:48,740
more oxygen is coming in and the
chemistry is balancing out a depression

494
00:28:50,041 --> 00:28:52,860
is caused by a wrong chemistry.

495
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,310
Creating inflammation.
I,

496
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,330
you know,
I'm a regular exerciser,

497
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,600
but sometimes I just get real busy and
I,

498
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,850
I take a couple of days off and
sometimes I take couple of days off and

499
00:29:02,851 --> 00:29:04,800
I just don't feel right.
Maybe.

500
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:08,670
I mean I'm not a self indulgent person,
but sometimes I'll just feel like,

501
00:29:08,671 --> 00:29:09,690
ah,
God,

502
00:29:09,691 --> 00:29:11,610
I just feel kind of shitty today or
whatever.

503
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:14,490
And then I forced myself to exercise.
I go,

504
00:29:14,491 --> 00:29:16,450
look,
I'm going to get up an hour early or I

505
00:29:16,451 --> 00:29:17,970
want to do whatever I have to do and I'm
going to,

506
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:19,110
you know,
before I go to bed,

507
00:29:19,111 --> 00:29:21,390
whatever it is,
I'm going to make sure that the day will

508
00:29:21,391 --> 00:29:25,530
not end until I exercise and when I do
all that goes away,

509
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,200
the feelings go away.
It's like have a new brain.

510
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:31,710
It's like I leave there,
I'm smiling and laughing,

511
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:33,270
you know,
it seems like everything is just

512
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:36,240
beautiful again and that's you and it's.
And I'm the same person,

513
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:41,190
but it's also like my life has the same.
Not that my life is bad in way.

514
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,070
My life is fantastic.

515
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:43,420
It's not,
it's all great stuff,

516
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:47,320
but just being a person sometimes being
a person is overwhelming.

517
00:29:47,321 --> 00:29:48,980
You're tired,
you know you're,

518
00:29:48,981 --> 00:29:52,090
you have a lot of obligations,
there's a lot on your plate.

519
00:29:52,091 --> 00:29:54,310
There's a lot of things going on and
sometimes it's overwhelming.

520
00:29:54,311 --> 00:29:57,760
Sometimes you just feel down,
you know,

521
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:01,780
and I have a good life.
It's a very fun life.

522
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,150
If I didn't have a fun life and that
happened,

523
00:30:04,151 --> 00:30:07,030
it would just be compounding all the
other issues that I have now.

524
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:12,300
Tack on that if I was overweight tack on
that if I was on hooked on pills or I

525
00:30:13,181 --> 00:30:16,930
was an alcoholic or cigarette smoking or
one of the other things that are really

526
00:30:16,931 --> 00:30:18,730
terrible for you that so many people
suffer from,

527
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:22,040
if all those things you don't think,
uh,

528
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:26,080
I think there's so many people that
think of depression or bad states of

529
00:30:26,081 --> 00:30:31,081
mind as being just something that you
are a hand that you're dealt and it's.

530
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:34,210
I don't,
I don't necessarily think it's the case

531
00:30:34,211 --> 00:30:36,670
with everybody because I don't know how
everybody's mind works,

532
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:41,940
but I know certainly from my mind I can
absolutely regulate those ups and downs

533
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:46,900
based on rigorous exercise.
And it doesn't have to be lifting

534
00:30:46,901 --> 00:30:49,840
weights or crossfit or Jujitsu or
anything crazy.

535
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:53,020
Just go walk up a hill,
just go hike,

536
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:53,903
just go,
hike,

537
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,960
go hike.
You take those big deep breaths.

538
00:30:55,961 --> 00:30:58,420
You get to the top of that hill.
You fucking feel great.

539
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,100
Yeah,
very good.

540
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,250
So,
uh,

541
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:02,740
I,
I can do that too.

542
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,180
You know,
you could do it,

543
00:31:04,181 --> 00:31:05,530
you do it in your underwear.
Yeah,

544
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:06,364
yeah,
yeah.

545
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:07,840
No,
yeah.

546
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:11,230
Go to the experiment and show that it is
all possible.

547
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:16,680
Even in the most extreme conditions.
Now I'm at the knocking at the door,

548
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:23,690
uh,
of science and I feel I'm able to help.

549
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:26,830
Well,
science very much interested in what

550
00:31:26,831 --> 00:31:27,550
you're doing.

551
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:32,290
Yes they do.
The scientific community embraced this,

552
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,690
but I feel,
hey man,

553
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:38,800
I'm able actually to help a human men
card.

554
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,900
Well,
it's so extraordinary that one person

555
00:31:40,901 --> 00:31:42,210
has this kind of influenced.
I mean,

556
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:46,890
I hope you realize what a service you're
providing to people because you're

557
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:50,350
bringing,
bringing awareness.

558
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:53,050
Well thank you,
but I'm doing is just talking to someone

559
00:31:53,051 --> 00:31:55,050
who's awesome,
but this,

560
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:58,390
this thing that you've done,
you would think that other people would

561
00:31:58,391 --> 00:32:01,240
have figured it out and that's what I
find most fascinating about you.

562
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:03,370
I would have thought that last time you
were here.

563
00:32:03,371 --> 00:32:04,204
I mean,
I just,

564
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:08,530
it's hard to believe there are so few
people that have done what you've done

565
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:11,140
or figured out what you've,
what you figured out,

566
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:15,640
and then even more unusual,
what you've done is you've gone to

567
00:32:15,641 --> 00:32:17,590
scientists and you said,
hey,

568
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,020
I think I'm onto something.
Please study me.

569
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:21,970
Like,
please study what I'm doing.

570
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,910
And you got people to listen to you by
accomplishing all these incredible

571
00:32:24,911 --> 00:32:25,480
feats.
They go,

572
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:25,991
well,
this guy,

573
00:32:25,991 --> 00:32:27,750
obviously he's doing something.
I mean,

574
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:31,510
who the fucking swim 100 yards under
frozen ice in one breath.

575
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:36,750
Who the fuck is running marathons
barefoot above the polar circle?

576
00:32:37,031 --> 00:32:39,050
All this shit that you're doing it,
it,

577
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:40,430
it's,
it's wonderful.

578
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:45,350
It's forcing people to acknowledge the
fact that something extraordinary is

579
00:32:45,351 --> 00:32:46,820
going on.
So it is.

580
00:32:46,821 --> 00:32:49,700
And you know,
we got big problems and issues with

581
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:51,560
people with PTSD,
depression,

582
00:32:51,561 --> 00:32:52,430
trauma,
fear,

583
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:55,220
anxiety in general.
It's all stress,

584
00:32:55,221 --> 00:32:58,190
stress hormone.
And now using the,

585
00:32:58,191 --> 00:32:59,060
uh,
uh,

586
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:02,150
developing a method and finding it out
because I

587
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:06,980
was in this quest to go deeper within
myself,

588
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,051
finding,
uh,

589
00:33:08,051 --> 00:33:09,060
uh,
the,

590
00:33:09,061 --> 00:33:14,061
the cold as the right teacher to bring
me into the depth of my physiology.

591
00:33:14,391 --> 00:33:18,770
Finally finding a way,
the way nature meant me to be,

592
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:24,190
to feel strong and in control of myself.
I brought this now,

593
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:25,580
Eh,
to side.

594
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:30,910
And now it is a matter of time that we
will resolve what we have lost the

595
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:38,080
connection with the depth of ourselves.
And that means for people maybe not for

596
00:33:38,601 --> 00:33:41,540
you,
because you are able to handle your mood

597
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,680
and your physical strength and your
health.

598
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:48,920
That's good.
But for those who have ptsd,

599
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:50,480
trauma,
anxiety,

600
00:33:50,481 --> 00:33:51,650
fear,
depression,

601
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:54,200
our immune diseases,
cancer,

602
00:33:55,190 --> 00:34:00,190
all these things I think nature knows.
And I found these keys in a nature.

603
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:06,110
I just bring it to the science and we
forgot about the nature.

604
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:11,950
And this is where I wear a couple of
note.

605
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:14,320
And,
uh,

606
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:14,770
I think,
uh,

607
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:18,410
you know,
if we are able not only to show that the

608
00:34:18,411 --> 00:34:20,870
autonomous nervous system,
the hormonal system,

609
00:34:20,871 --> 00:34:24,050
the immune system can be influenced
deeply,

610
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:28,060
that means hormone or system that is the
Melatonin,

611
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:33,070
Serotonin and dopamine and any feel good
hormone within us and the ability to tap

612
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:38,210
into that system and create those
hormones when necessary.

613
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:42,860
When you feel bad,
you just go get a shot naturally by

614
00:34:42,861 --> 00:34:47,630
breathing unbelieving,
have the right hormones and you feel

615
00:34:47,631 --> 00:34:48,980
great.
Okay?

616
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,610
And then you got the strength,
which is also based on hormones,

617
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,700
hormonal,
hormonal,

618
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:57,470
uh,
secretions like adrenaline,

619
00:34:57,471 --> 00:34:59,740
epinephrine,
cortisol,

620
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:04,160
a dose,
and we show people lying in bed as I

621
00:35:04,161 --> 00:35:06,480
taught last.
That tap embed,

622
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:10,640
embed,
producing more adrenaline controlled

623
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:14,030
stress or more than somebody going into
a inferior,

624
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:18,400
going into its first banking job.
That means controlled stress hormone,

625
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,060
adrenaline,
adrenaline,

626
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:23,730
which is controlled.
Stress Hormone works like Madison.

627
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:28,830
And either it brings you back to the way
nature made us most effective in

628
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:32,950
situations of danger.
That could be cold,

629
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:37,870
the extreme cold heat.
It could be being credited by the light

630
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,340
control,

631
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:41,880
like a werewolf or.
Yes.

632
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:43,820
Yeah.
The real and

633
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:50,750
I think in society moves even bigger
than the one I saw you.

634
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:54,350
What do you think is a big shocks you
meet?

635
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,210
You use an analogy,
obviously you don't think that people

636
00:35:57,211 --> 00:35:58,490
really turned to wolves.
He thinks,

637
00:35:58,850 --> 00:35:59,201
no,
no,

638
00:35:59,201 --> 00:35:59,520
no,
no,

639
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,720
not really.
Not really.

640
00:36:00,721 --> 00:36:04,210
Only in Hollywood and a lie can tropes
and old.

641
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:07,530
Very nice,
very nice,

642
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:10,470
very nice.
I just,

643
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:14,910
it a beautiful,
a beautiful,

644
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:18,580
beautiful piece of art and that,
you know,

645
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:21,240
that's the strength part and that you
get to,

646
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:23,060
uh,
the health part,

647
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:26,910
that immune system and all its layers.
So let me ask you this,

648
00:36:26,911 --> 00:36:30,060
because adrenaline with fighting,
uh,

649
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,790
is,
is considered to be a very dangerous

650
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:36,480
thing to,
to manage because there's a thing called

651
00:36:36,481 --> 00:36:38,940
the adrenaline dump that happens to a
lot of fighters.

652
00:36:38,941 --> 00:36:42,300
So they get so worked up,
they're so jazzed up before a fight and

653
00:36:42,301 --> 00:36:46,770
then they're in the fight and then
somewhere around the first round the

654
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:50,040
adrenaline goes away and they have this
dump and they get exhausted.

655
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,513
Uh,
that's,

656
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:54,840
that's very interesting.
It's called adrenaline dump and it

657
00:36:54,841 --> 00:36:56,460
happens,
but I mean they're under extreme

658
00:36:56,461 --> 00:37:00,030
stressful situations in guys gas.
How'd they get very tired very quickly

659
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:05,400
and a lot of them talk about it.
I couldn't believe how tired I got and

660
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:07,980
it's attributed to adrenaline.
Yes,

661
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:10,960
but that then is no control over the
adrenaline,

662
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:14,490
so bright.
So they allow it to run away from them.

663
00:37:14,491 --> 00:37:16,170
It's like that old expression.
Do you remember the.

664
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:20,310
There was a very famous custom motto.
Expression customer was the guy who

665
00:37:20,311 --> 00:37:21,690
trained Mike Tyson.
He said,

666
00:37:21,691 --> 00:37:25,470
fire can be your friend or it can be
your enemy can cook your food or it can

667
00:37:25,471 --> 00:37:28,060
burn your house down.
It depends on how you control it.

668
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:33,600
It's all very interesting to defining
modus of ours,

669
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:36,270
which is related to the fight mode is
fight,

670
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,640
flight food,
priests and fuck,

671
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,200
that's the brainstem.

672
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:42,390
Yes.
It's all the same energy.

673
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:43,840
It's oldest.
Hey,

674
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,910
managing.
Yeah.

675
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:47,190
Procreation.
Protect your children.

676
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,390
Food.
Primal,

677
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:53,160
primal.
The primal forces are directly related

678
00:37:53,161 --> 00:37:58,161
to adrenaline and we lost a control
there over because we lost the deeper

679
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,400
connection with,
uh,

680
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,470
with that system within our brain,
the brainstem.

681
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:10,040
And therefore we do not know how to
handle danger anymore as such,

682
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:15,570
danger is not only cold and a heat and
oxygen deprivation as a,

683
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:19,680
uh,
situations like Mount Everest or

684
00:38:19,681 --> 00:38:22,430
something,
but also daily stress.

685
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:26,950
It's also things seeing things that
carry with them extreme consequences or

686
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:29,840
you get nervous and you get freaked out.
Yeah,

687
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:34,110
and I think that's for people that
aren't in situations that are very

688
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:35,740
stressful,
very often

689
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:39,010
it becomes a huge issue and they
oftentimes can't control their

690
00:38:39,011 --> 00:38:40,840
adrenaline.
They can't control their anxiety,

691
00:38:40,841 --> 00:38:44,020
they can't control that.
Even their own thoughts.

692
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:48,010
They get tunnel vision.
It's like they're in an elevator as the

693
00:38:48,011 --> 00:38:50,440
doors are closing shot and they can't
see.

694
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:56,430
You literally see it in fights.
You see people panic and that panic does

695
00:38:56,681 --> 00:39:01,330
not allow them to be present,
which does not allow them to perform at

696
00:39:01,331 --> 00:39:02,800
their very best.
And they're almost,

697
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:07,660
they're almost always severely
diminished because of that adrenaline or

698
00:39:07,661 --> 00:39:09,100
because of that panic,
I should say,

699
00:39:09,101 --> 00:39:11,350
not necessarily the adrenaline,
but the,

700
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:16,530
the loss of management,
loss of loss of your ability to be

701
00:39:18,611 --> 00:39:19,680
sovereign.
You know,

702
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:23,110
you're not in control anymore.
You're being carried away by a wave of

703
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:23,650
fear.

704
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:28,030
Yes.
Now I ideal with her sports people.

705
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:31,320
He did a lot of work with allister over
me and many more,

706
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:34,070
many more.
And I'm uh,

707
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:39,090
in general when they do the breathing
exercises and the cold exposure,

708
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:44,540
deb has become just more energetic and
they have a lot more connection with

709
00:39:44,681 --> 00:39:48,490
their own body,
the creating confidence within

710
00:39:48,491 --> 00:39:51,800
themselves.
And then they are able to build up this

711
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:55,990
connection mind body and,
and uh,

712
00:39:56,370 --> 00:40:00,040
they are cardio increases their
tranquility.

713
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,280
Well,
you had some great results with the

714
00:40:02,281 --> 00:40:06,280
Alastar let me tell you that because he
was on a downward spiral

715
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:09,350
or you started working with us,
kind of come to Kilimanjaro to,

716
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:14,470
because I need to train them again.
I think he lost track a little bit on

717
00:40:14,571 --> 00:40:19,571
the breathing exercises and he thought
he was already there.

718
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:23,810
I think that that's my opinion.
And I talked to,

719
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:24,590
uh,
will,

720
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:27,260
uh,
we will go to the Kilimanjaro.

721
00:40:27,261 --> 00:40:28,590
I,
I will say,

722
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:30,050
listen,
here,

723
00:40:30,051 --> 00:40:34,280
you have to breathe here.
You will understand the significance of

724
00:40:34,281 --> 00:40:39,281
breeding and now to take a to lightly go
back into yourself and do not think you

725
00:40:41,841 --> 00:40:45,980
are there,
be there and the mountain.

726
00:40:45,981 --> 00:40:49,100
The mother nature will show you.
It's not me.

727
00:40:49,101 --> 00:40:54,101
I just know to abide by the laws of
Mother Nature and that's why I do these

728
00:40:54,441 --> 00:40:59,441
feet there and it makes me able to adapt
very rapidly to changes in like a cold

729
00:41:01,911 --> 00:41:05,020
heat,
oxygen deprivation situations,

730
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:10,090
anything.
It's there and a mother nature will

731
00:41:10,761 --> 00:41:11,510
teach them.

732
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:14,180
Why do you think that he stopped doing
it?

733
00:41:14,181 --> 00:41:16,010
Like what?
What gives you that indication?

734
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:21,950
There's a certain moment people think I
control,

735
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:26,960
I can control it,
I can do it and I'm in a positive spiral

736
00:41:26,961 --> 00:41:31,961
going up and it's all okay.
Then they leave this connection and they

737
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:36,230
fall back into old patterns.
The old neurology,

738
00:41:36,231 --> 00:41:41,231
the old conditioning.
So they require daily practice until

739
00:41:41,691 --> 00:41:46,691
it's really mastered.
So it takes how many years it takes to

740
00:41:47,121 --> 00:41:50,780
condition your body.
A really to,

741
00:41:50,781 --> 00:41:53,460
uh,
to become really so good to be in,

742
00:41:53,461 --> 00:41:54,350
say,
k one.

743
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:59,380
And I'm a at the top.
It takes years to build that up.

744
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:06,100
But it's still there.
He will compete with people who also

745
00:42:06,381 --> 00:42:11,381
conditioned their bodies,
so it's a eagle thing going up and what

746
00:42:11,661 --> 00:42:15,890
makes the difference.
That's the connection of your mind with

747
00:42:15,891 --> 00:42:18,530
your body,
of your brainstem,

748
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:23,540
with your conscious will and the body
controlling the adrenaline,

749
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:26,730
not only auto painter,
friend,

750
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,910
noradrenaline,
dopamine,

751
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:29,893
anything.

752
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:33,800
Now when you're watching someone like
alister fight and he just fought for the

753
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:37,820
UFC heavyweight title and came very
close to winning a couple of times in

754
00:42:37,821 --> 00:42:42,620
that first round and wind up losing.
What makes you think that breathing

755
00:42:42,621 --> 00:42:45,080
could have helped him in that?
Because he almost won the fight.

756
00:42:45,081 --> 00:42:48,200
He almost knocked pay out.
He almost caught him in a guillotine

757
00:42:48,201 --> 00:42:49,034
choke.
I mean,

758
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:53,390
and he had Steve Bay and a lot of
trouble on two separate occasions than

759
00:42:53,391 --> 00:42:55,250
Steve Bay caught him and knocked him
out.

760
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,920
What makes you think that breathing
would have helped him?

761
00:42:57,921 --> 00:43:02,330
Their breathing
brings in oxygen.

762
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:07,780
Oxygen makes buddy alkalotic the nervous
system that that is a nervous system,

763
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:15,040
goes better when it is alkaline.
The swiftness of neurotransmitters,

764
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:22,730
which is a neurotransmitter in the way
makes the body react like Bruce Lee

765
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:24,470
Taylor again,
say the word again,

766
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:28,790
I'll say till Hollinger as a teal
collide.

767
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,080
Acetylcholine.
Yes.

768
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:32,660
Okay.
And yes.

769
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:39,130
What I do all the time with people or
women who are not able to do pushups,

770
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:43,550
I make them do the breathing,
influence,

771
00:43:43,551 --> 00:43:46,310
muscle tissue,
making it alkaline.

772
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:48,920
So the neurotransmitter,
the performance,

773
00:43:48,921 --> 00:43:51,980
newer terms,
motors suddenly is able to keep on

774
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:55,580
because it's not becoming acidic.
When you say acidic and alkaline,

775
00:43:55,610 --> 00:43:57,590
what are you measuring?
Are you measuring blood?

776
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,980
Are you measuring muscle,
muscle tissue?

777
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:03,640
How are they doing?
Uh,

778
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:05,180
you can,
uh,

779
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:10,240
but with a simple ph strip,
you can show yourself,

780
00:44:11,810 --> 00:44:16,790
say before e five a,
and who's doing these tests as

781
00:44:16,791 --> 00:44:17,930
scientists,
we're doing these tests.

782
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:18,783
You.
Yes,

783
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:22,300
that's what we,
we just completed the new studies were

784
00:44:22,301 --> 00:44:27,301
two for 48 people and it showed that all
the people got to very,

785
00:44:28,821 --> 00:44:31,560
very high alkaline levels in the blood,

786
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:36,510
like seven point eight.
What's normal at seven point three?

787
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:38,490
Seven.
Point four is natural.

788
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:42,090
And then you go all the way up to seven
point eight and then it comes back and

789
00:44:42,091 --> 00:44:47,091
it stays over there for all the day long
and that's what you want.

790
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:51,690
But most of the People Are Acidic if you
pee on it.

791
00:44:51,691 --> 00:44:56,691
And then you will see with a Ph strip,
yellow to blue and green in the middle.

792
00:44:56,761 --> 00:45:01,260
And all these variations,
they say most of the people are just

793
00:45:01,261 --> 00:45:06,261
yellow in the morning and they do the
breathing 20 minutes and they become

794
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:07,800
blue.
Boom.

795
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:12,490
And that's why you want to have it.
Because the neurotransmitters,

796
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:17,510
the electrical signals in the body,
they traveled a lot faster when it's

797
00:45:17,971 --> 00:45:22,971
alkaline.
So you same punch will be faster if a

798
00:45:23,351 --> 00:45:25,130
disease alkaline.
Then when Sam Seder.

799
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:29,010
And actually it's a logical,
if I'm going to train with us and become

800
00:45:29,011 --> 00:45:31,020
a headache at a certain moment,
you know,

801
00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:35,760
I get to my limit that I not a pointing
as fast.

802
00:45:36,090 --> 00:45:40,560
Then when alkaline,
it's all in the muscle and we are able

803
00:45:40,561 --> 00:45:42,630
to influence their right.
So,

804
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:44,100
um,
he,

805
00:45:44,130 --> 00:45:44,963
he did,
he,

806
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:47,370
he wasn't too much in the breathing
animal.

807
00:45:47,950 --> 00:45:50,790
That was
a no,

808
00:45:50,791 --> 00:45:53,040
I saw it.
I saw how you could tell,

809
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:56,420
I imagined before I was in his room and
uh,

810
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:57,360
we did,
uh,

811
00:45:57,450 --> 00:45:59,100
I tested him,
hey,

812
00:45:59,101 --> 00:46:02,130
how is your breathing and how is your
retention?

813
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:07,320
Like what you did two and a half minutes
to first round you remember that means

814
00:46:07,321 --> 00:46:12,060
you store up oxygen in the body and
therefore you have no need for breathing

815
00:46:12,610 --> 00:46:16,710
and you just measuring that.
So do you think any of them had to do

816
00:46:16,711 --> 00:46:19,760
with the stress of fighting for the
first time title?

817
00:46:19,830 --> 00:46:20,241
Not.
Well,

818
00:46:20,241 --> 00:46:24,600
he was over over to to confident.
Really.

819
00:46:24,601 --> 00:46:26,760
You think he was too confident?
Too confident.

820
00:46:26,790 --> 00:46:29,360
Why do you say that now?
Because I saw her psych.

821
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:31,770
Yeah.
But it didn't seem that way to me as a,

822
00:46:31,771 --> 00:46:35,490
as a trained observer,
I felt he was dealing with a lot of

823
00:46:35,491 --> 00:46:38,280
anxiety because especially the way he
was fighting,

824
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:40,650
he was,
I mean he literally was running at

825
00:46:40,651 --> 00:46:42,050
certain points and yeah,
that's how I saw.

826
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:43,750
I saw I was there.
Yeah,

827
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:45,330
I saw you there.
The ring.

828
00:46:45,331 --> 00:46:47,430
I was somewhere on the stairs.
So I know,

829
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:51,900
I'm just saying like when I look at that
and I look at the way he was performing,

830
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:55,590
he wasn't performing the way he
performed against junior dos Santos.

831
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:56,700
Yes,
exactly.

832
00:46:56,701 --> 00:46:58,920
Yeah.
And that's because,

833
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:02,730
and that's what I think with all the
respect for him.

834
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:05,160
I love him.
He's a good guy,

835
00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:10,620
but he uh,
his mother nature knows better and I

836
00:47:10,621 --> 00:47:15,621
know mother nature,
so I saw he needs to get back to this

837
00:47:15,810 --> 00:47:20,460
breathing back thing,
making it alkaline daren and keeping it

838
00:47:20,461 --> 00:47:21,840
on until the conditioning.

839
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:25,230
The old patterns go away.
So you think he got tired?

840
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:26,910
What do you think happened there?
Yes,

841
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:29,100
but what about him getting hit?
Because he got.

842
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,630
Yeah,
I mean he went for a.

843
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:36,220
anything you are not able to receive
blows as,

844
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:41,340
as good as a chemistry,
which is low in Ph level is if you are

845
00:47:44,201 --> 00:47:49,201
acidic that then you are.
I understand that to receive the steeper

846
00:47:49,251 --> 00:47:51,730
meal check,
the UFC heavyweight champion is 250

847
00:47:51,731 --> 00:47:55,390
pounds of meat.
He's a scary dude and he hits very hard

848
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:58,390
and he's very accurate and there's not a
whole lot of people that he punches in

849
00:47:58,391 --> 00:48:01,540
the face that don't get knocked out and
the way he was hitting allister,

850
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:04,330
I have a hard time believing that
anything would have saved him,

851
00:48:04,331 --> 00:48:07,570
whether it's breathing or anything.
He was getting cracked.

852
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:09,850
Again,
one of the best fighters in the world.

853
00:48:09,850 --> 00:48:10,990
Yes,
of course.

854
00:48:11,370 --> 00:48:15,100
That's good.
But I'm not into a increase in the

855
00:48:15,101 --> 00:48:18,430
performance of any sports when I do that
at the side,

856
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:23,790
but I want to draw to your attention for
people who are suffering in the world.

857
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:24,761
No,
I understand that.

858
00:48:24,761 --> 00:48:25,594
But whatever I am,
I just,

859
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:28,060
I'm talking about this moment in
specifically.

860
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:33,360
Why did you think that his lack of
breathing or whatever it had an effect

861
00:48:33,701 --> 00:48:35,770
on it.
Did you feel like he got tired too

862
00:48:35,771 --> 00:48:38,260
quickly?
Did you notice him diminishing his

863
00:48:38,261 --> 00:48:39,370
energy levels?
Dropping?

864
00:48:39,371 --> 00:48:42,730
Like what?
What did you seen that made you believe

865
00:48:42,731 --> 00:48:45,160
that he was not doing the breathing
practice?

866
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:47,430
It's not only have that day,
uh,

867
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:49,300
[inaudible],
it's a whole process,

868
00:48:49,390 --> 00:48:53,860
right?
So if y'all are at a top like that at

869
00:48:53,861 --> 00:48:55,640
the most of,
uh,

870
00:48:55,730 --> 00:48:58,660
they're fighting a level to have this
world,

871
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:04,000
then you got to work your body,
you got to condition your body and that

872
00:49:04,030 --> 00:49:08,560
you do with the ride breathing exercises
along with the fighting and the air

873
00:49:08,561 --> 00:49:11,060
conditioning and the muscle training at
all.

874
00:49:11,350 --> 00:49:15,400
And if it is not there that you can have
the muscles of the world,

875
00:49:15,430 --> 00:49:20,140
but very soon you will be exhausted.
Now when you work with a guy like

876
00:49:20,141 --> 00:49:23,200
alister,
with all due respect to him and to you,

877
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:28,990
he's been knocked out four times in the
UFC alone and he's been knocked out many

878
00:49:28,991 --> 00:49:33,790
times outside of the UFC.
Do you have any concern about the amount

879
00:49:33,791 --> 00:49:38,050
of damage that he's taking and do you
think that in any way,

880
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:43,260
this kind of training and the breathing
method could in some way help mitigate

881
00:49:44,261 --> 00:49:46,300
some of that damage he's taking?
Absolutely,

882
00:49:46,301 --> 00:49:47,410
yes.
Yes.

883
00:49:47,830 --> 00:49:50,590
And um,
I will say about him,

884
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:54,850
he will come back.
It will get a very good lesson though

885
00:49:54,851 --> 00:49:59,020
for my mother nature and me and Darragh
is no,

886
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,500
you cannot speculate about mother
nature.

887
00:50:02,501 --> 00:50:06,700
You just got to perform the right way.
What do you mean by the 24 hours getting

888
00:50:06,701 --> 00:50:11,701
up a kid of Magento,
that beans with his weight and getting

889
00:50:12,311 --> 00:50:14,020
out there,
that means breathing,

890
00:50:14,530 --> 00:50:19,510
really breathing,
really getting into and using your mind

891
00:50:19,511 --> 00:50:20,290
and focus.

892
00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:23,920
Totally not thinking that you are able
to do it,

893
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:27,040
but doing it.
One thing that does happen to fighters

894
00:50:27,670 --> 00:50:30,140
and it happens inevitably in a fighter's
career,

895
00:50:30,141 --> 00:50:33,200
if they've taken a lot of fights where
they were real wars,

896
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:35,330
is they lose their ability to take a
punch.

897
00:50:35,331 --> 00:50:38,210
It's a physiological response.
The brain has to.

898
00:50:38,211 --> 00:50:41,270
The amount of punishment that you've
been taking and it knows the punishments

899
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:45,260
coming and it shuts off prematurely,
shuts off much quicker than it did when

900
00:50:45,261 --> 00:50:50,261
you were younger and in the fight game,
they call it getting Chiney or his chin

901
00:50:50,391 --> 00:50:52,760
is gone.
You know where you take a shot and you

902
00:50:52,761 --> 00:50:54,710
can see that you just can't take it
anymore,

903
00:50:54,711 --> 00:50:59,300
and doctors take that almost universally
as a sign.

904
00:50:59,510 --> 00:51:01,790
They should probably start thinking
about hanging it up.

905
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:03,021
Yeah,
yeah,

906
00:51:03,021 --> 00:51:05,490
yeah.
I see that at all in him and you.

907
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:07,130
Are you concerned about that at all?

908
00:51:09,970 --> 00:51:14,200
I will say that did a January.
So you'll see it once you make it a,

909
00:51:14,730 --> 00:51:16,190
but that's,
it doesn't have anything to do with

910
00:51:16,191 --> 00:51:19,760
physical condition.
It has more to do with punishment.

911
00:51:20,030 --> 00:51:25,030
Has More to do with getting hit.
I'm not so much into fighting and oldest

912
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:31,880
toll information.
I just know how nature works and I will

913
00:51:31,881 --> 00:51:33,590
test them.
I will see it.

914
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:38,620
I will observe and get my objective.
I will try to help him and I get my

915
00:51:39,891 --> 00:51:41,490
objective opinion.
Uh,

916
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:44,360
they're in and that's what I'm going to
do.

917
00:51:44,361 --> 00:51:46,010
I'm going to take a,
by the way,

918
00:51:46,011 --> 00:51:48,440
Aalto a high performance,
uh,

919
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:51,840
extreme athlete as well,
up on the mountain,

920
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:56,600
but also people with conditions and
that's actually even more interesting.

921
00:51:56,630 --> 00:52:00,270
Like what kinds of conditions like
Crohn's disease and Roma to weed to

922
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:04,400
thrive.
This asthma and they will make it in 24

923
00:52:04,401 --> 00:52:07,490
hours as well,
just because of this breathing.

924
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:10,760
People with rheumatoid arthritis,
you can take them up.

925
00:52:10,761 --> 00:52:13,700
Mount Kilimanjaro already did I already
did?

926
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:17,090
Yes.
And they do oldest program all the time

927
00:52:17,330 --> 00:52:20,690
and they have zero flammatory markers
left in the body.

928
00:52:20,990 --> 00:52:24,560
So they controlled a or a condition,
arthritis,

929
00:52:24,830 --> 00:52:28,870
crones disease.
I'll take immune diseases complete.

930
00:52:29,110 --> 00:52:32,840
And how severe is their arthritis?
Because people that are like really

931
00:52:32,841 --> 00:52:37,340
crippled and they can't walk very well.
You've done that with them and with

932
00:52:37,341 --> 00:52:41,210
papers it up to a certain level.
I mean if you can't walk anymore,

933
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:43,940
right?
How do you of Magento.

934
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,880
Right.
But if you can barely walk or what?

935
00:52:46,881 --> 00:52:49,570
If you can walk,
we'll walk slow or what if you walk when

936
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:50,730
you walk in pain?
Hey,

937
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:53,510
yes.
I'm into scientific research because I

938
00:52:53,511 --> 00:52:58,511
want to help humanity direct and I know
what we are able to tap into the systems

939
00:52:59,571 --> 00:53:04,571
and begin to heal first before we go
into say feats like that.

940
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:09,500
So you work with these people that have
arthritis or Crohn's disease right now

941
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:12,740
to strengthen their immune system,
scientific research or their

942
00:53:12,770 --> 00:53:15,650
inflammation first year.
And how much time do you spend with them

943
00:53:15,651 --> 00:53:18,650
before you take them to something like
extreme environment?

944
00:53:18,651 --> 00:53:22,560
Like Kilimanjaro I got now my
instructors ever.

945
00:53:22,561 --> 00:53:26,130
We were.
So first I teach them in

946
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:27,540
a session.
How many instructors?

947
00:53:27,541 --> 00:53:29,070
Yeah.
Now what,

948
00:53:29,071 --> 00:53:31,230
how many is it?
A $200.

949
00:53:31,290 --> 00:53:32,730
200.
Wow.

950
00:53:32,731 --> 00:53:34,230
All over the world.
Uh,

951
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:37,020
uh,
mostly in the Netherlands now.

952
00:53:37,410 --> 00:53:40,530
But now America is beginning to do the
basic course,

953
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:44,940
an advanced module.
And then we have the instructors wick

954
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:48,410
and it goes up to a bachelor level,
eh?

955
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:52,560
The books are in the university.
It's real late at all and scientifically

956
00:53:52,561 --> 00:53:54,360
endorsed.
And there it is.

957
00:53:54,390 --> 00:53:58,680
It works and it works with us for those
people.

958
00:53:58,681 --> 00:54:01,680
And we still got to find out tomorrow
par example,

959
00:54:01,690 --> 00:54:03,060
I got a,
uh,

960
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:04,880
scientific,
uh,

961
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:10,580
sort of lecture together with Professor
Huberman from Stanford University in

962
00:54:10,831 --> 00:54:15,510
front of Ideo and Ideo.
There comes a guy who is the google

963
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:18,500
healthcare,
a hat of the doll,

964
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:23,790
and he was the former man in charge of
the health care in America.

965
00:54:23,791 --> 00:54:28,500
In us.
I mean big people and it's not for

966
00:54:28,501 --> 00:54:29,334
nothing.

967
00:54:29,390 --> 00:54:33,360
They see it works.
It doesn't work only for say people with

968
00:54:33,361 --> 00:54:37,220
arthritis,
but also with depression is how much

969
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:39,390
people feel better.
Yes.

970
00:54:39,391 --> 00:54:40,470
Yes,
yes.

971
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:42,660
Preventative,
uh,

972
00:54:43,010 --> 00:54:45,600
increasing quality of life.
Yes sir.

973
00:54:45,630 --> 00:54:48,540
Yes sir,
and that is only because of a simple

974
00:54:48,541 --> 00:54:52,620
principle out of nature.
Go back to mother nature inside,

975
00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:56,900
go back into the depth of your own
physiology and know that it is dire.

976
00:54:56,910 --> 00:55:01,110
You are able to awaken that and get it
into your control,

977
00:55:01,890 --> 00:55:06,300
preventing you from disease,
from depression or becoming happy,

978
00:55:06,330 --> 00:55:09,600
healthy,
so essentially it's in some ways tapping

979
00:55:09,601 --> 00:55:13,350
into the same force that creates the
placebo effect because there is an

980
00:55:13,351 --> 00:55:16,920
effect when your mind thinks that it has
a drug that's going to heal it,

981
00:55:17,010 --> 00:55:20,340
even if it's a sugar pill.
You see a visible improvement on many

982
00:55:20,341 --> 00:55:25,290
people because of that belief,
your belief system plus the oxygen plus

983
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:28,860
the deep breathing exercise and the
increasing blood flow to the brain.

984
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:32,440
It has all these positive and then at
the Colt trains,

985
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,600
gradual cold exposure trains their
transportation system.

986
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:41,900
Seventy 5,000 miles of capillaries,
arteries and veins within us.

987
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:47,480
They transport oxygen.
There are in a primitive muscles and

988
00:55:47,851 --> 00:55:52,350
reflexes and when they are stimulated by
cold showers,

989
00:55:52,710 --> 00:55:57,270
just cold showers,
then the heart rate is going down and

990
00:55:57,290 --> 00:56:02,290
the transportation of oxygen suddenly is
a lot better and it gets to the immune

991
00:56:02,911 --> 00:56:04,230
cells.
Logically.

992
00:56:04,231 --> 00:56:06,030
The immune cells,
we are more alert,

993
00:56:06,390 --> 00:56:11,390
better fat at a date.
They recognize intruders who should not

994
00:56:12,330 --> 00:56:14,900
be there and they.
They killed up there.

995
00:56:14,950 --> 00:56:19,950
It's like cell death and they put a
specific hormone molecule on the cell

996
00:56:20,701 --> 00:56:24,820
membrane and it's gone now.
How long has it been since the first

997
00:56:24,821 --> 00:56:25,481
podcast?
We did.

998
00:56:25,481 --> 00:56:29,110
Was it two years?
A year and a half or something like

999
00:56:29,111 --> 00:56:31,660
that?
A year and a half.

1000
00:56:31,870 --> 00:56:35,560
Jamie will tell us.
October 2015.

1001
00:56:35,790 --> 00:56:36,261
Oh,
recently.

1002
00:56:36,261 --> 00:56:38,140
First.
Basically year.

1003
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:39,220
One year,
yes.

1004
00:56:39,221 --> 00:56:39,911
Yeah.
Oh yeah,

1005
00:56:39,911 --> 00:56:40,690
yeah.
Yeah.

1006
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:43,150
So what?
What has happened in a year?

1007
00:56:43,151 --> 00:56:48,151
What new breakthroughs or what new,
what new evidence and have in that year.

1008
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:54,600
The evidence is that people are
beginning to grasp the gravity of what I

1009
00:56:54,941 --> 00:56:58,790
found because two and a half years ago
I,

1010
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:01,810
I,
we had this publish it in one of the

1011
00:57:01,811 --> 00:57:06,811
best papers of the world,
the past papers to what proceedings of

1012
00:57:07,001 --> 00:57:11,070
National Academy of scientists,
which is highly repetitious,

1013
00:57:11,110 --> 00:57:16,110
reputed to scientific or a magazine.
It's like nature and United States and

1014
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:20,920
if you come and get into there then it's
really solid,

1015
00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:26,670
so they took it up into the books,
designed at a university books full

1016
00:57:27,731 --> 00:57:31,750
chapter,
and that's not for nothing and that's

1017
00:57:31,751 --> 00:57:36,640
what the new information,
the new physicians and biologists need

1018
00:57:36,641 --> 00:57:41,641
to digest as being signs.
So it is science and it's two and a half

1019
00:57:41,651 --> 00:57:46,580
years ago that we approved the autonomic
nervous system up till death.

1020
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:51,600
Never been proven in scientific history
to be influenced by humans now,

1021
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:58,030
not little bit to be influenced.
Being able to be influenced big time

1022
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:01,910
people,
enabling it within a quarter of our way

1023
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:07,140
to tap into the specific immune system,
which normally takes five to seven days.

1024
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:10,690
So that's a big finding.
I thought,

1025
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:13,900
wow,
now the world is going to turn the other

1026
00:58:13,901 --> 00:58:16,000
way.
Now people are going to see.

1027
00:58:16,001 --> 00:58:20,710
We are able to do so much more with what
we've got already.

1028
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:25,060
They are going to receive 10 Nobel
prizes,

1029
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:28,000
you know,
something like that because it is

1030
00:58:28,001 --> 00:58:29,380
something like that.
Right?

1031
00:58:29,650 --> 00:58:31,400
But Eh,
it takes time.

1032
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:36,250
It takes time.
So since last year I see more and more

1033
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:40,120
and more people getting to this and
that's nice,

1034
00:58:40,210 --> 00:58:45,210
but I want scientific validation more
because apparently they do not really

1035
00:58:46,871 --> 00:58:51,871
grasp within the scientific community
the gravity of what we found.

1036
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:55,860
It's historical.
It's not mine itself,

1037
00:58:55,930 --> 00:58:59,980
Mother Nature for don't you think?
It takes time for people and their

1038
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:03,280
opinions to shift when it comes to
things along these lines.

1039
00:59:03,370 --> 00:59:08,370
Apparently that's the psychology of
people and I'm finding this out.

1040
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:10,990
I got,
I got in the beginning,

1041
00:59:10,991 --> 00:59:14,500
very frustrated.
Now I begin to understand this is the

1042
00:59:14,501 --> 00:59:18,700
way it all comes top down and it takes
some time.

1043
00:59:18,910 --> 00:59:22,070
When Galileo found out that we are not
the center of

1044
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:25,310
the universe,
but it is the sun and we are turning

1045
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:30,311
around.
He was almost banned from the church and

1046
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:35,680
almost sentenced to death as a heretic
or things like that,

1047
00:59:35,991 --> 00:59:39,560
you know,
and it was just as truthful a new way of

1048
00:59:39,561 --> 00:59:40,700
thinking.
Right.

1049
00:59:40,701 --> 00:59:43,880
Well apparently not experiencing that
kind of resistance.

1050
00:59:43,881 --> 00:59:47,210
Right.
While you were experiencing not really

1051
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:49,550
seen universally praised.
Yes.

1052
00:59:49,551 --> 00:59:49,921
Yes.
Yeah.

1053
00:59:49,921 --> 00:59:54,560
It's just a matter of acceptance,
meaning people actually practicing it.

1054
00:59:54,620 --> 00:59:57,650
That's the issue.
I think the consequences,

1055
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:02,680
the positive consequences of practicing
this are enormous for every person into

1056
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:06,230
and very accessible,
very effective,

1057
01:00:06,231 --> 01:00:09,480
very fast.
I use your method before I go on stage a

1058
01:00:09,550 --> 01:00:10,760
really?
Yes.

1059
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:13,080
I started doing it.
I started doing it after our podcast

1060
01:00:13,090 --> 01:00:15,260
together.
I take these big giant deep breaths.

1061
01:00:15,261 --> 01:00:17,720
I let some out,
big giant deep breaths and I let them

1062
01:00:17,721 --> 01:00:20,900
out and I do it for several minutes
before my shows and I feel like I'm

1063
01:00:20,901 --> 01:00:24,020
high,
like I'm just filled with everything.

1064
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:26,420
Like woo would just feel crazy pumped
up.

1065
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:27,560
Good,
good,

1066
01:00:27,561 --> 01:00:30,950
good.
Does that enabled you to get a direct

1067
01:00:30,951 --> 01:00:34,130
access,
better access to your adrenaline?

1068
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:37,760
Uh,
the hormonal system and gives me,

1069
01:00:37,950 --> 01:00:40,970
it mean that breeding in like that it
gives me energy,

1070
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,310
it gives me,
it elevates me,

1071
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:45,530
it feel,
it feel like it elevates my energy

1072
01:00:45,531 --> 01:00:47,210
levels.
Thanks for taking it on.

1073
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:50,000
Thanks for having me last year this
year.

1074
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:54,770
And I'm into ongoing research right now
with German,

1075
01:00:55,020 --> 01:00:58,500
you know,
what's happening and how we got to.

1076
01:00:59,330 --> 01:01:03,900
We found out first time in scientific
history now and not me,

1077
01:01:03,901 --> 01:01:06,880
the university doing this,
uh,

1078
01:01:06,890 --> 01:01:09,230
doing this,
uh,

1079
01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:14,140
say to.
I was worried that it got on the

1080
01:01:14,150 --> 01:01:15,050
machinery.
Yeah,

1081
01:01:15,070 --> 01:01:15,903
yeah,
yeah.

1082
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:20,690
Thanks.
So for the first time in scientific

1083
01:01:20,691 --> 01:01:24,050
history,
they found out that hundred percent

1084
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:29,080
saturation or oxygen in the blood is not
really 100 percent right.

1085
01:01:29,511 --> 01:01:34,040
But what I don't understand that there's
no nothing more than 100 percent.

1086
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:36,980
Right?
So did they just not understand shit?

1087
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:39,410
So they had,
they had a level that they thought was

1088
01:01:39,411 --> 01:01:41,210
100 percent and they said,
well,

1089
01:01:41,260 --> 01:01:43,560
nobody has ever reached a higher level
and this.

1090
01:01:43,561 --> 01:01:45,800
So this must be what 100 percent
saturation looks like.

1091
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:48,740
Exactly.
So it's not that you got more than 100

1092
01:01:48,741 --> 01:01:52,970
percent saturation as you achieved
higher levels of saturation than they

1093
01:01:52,971 --> 01:01:54,770
thought possible.
Is that a better way of describing?

1094
01:01:54,950 --> 01:01:59,560
Exactly.
And they did it with a laser on the on

1095
01:01:59,561 --> 01:02:04,561
the chest and that you are able to
measure the mitochondrial oxygen

1096
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:10,370
tension,
Mitochondria electrical factor,

1097
01:02:10,371 --> 01:02:14,630
a little factories in the cell,
the engines of the sale of the south,

1098
01:02:14,660 --> 01:02:19,660
they are able to receive more oxygen and
that's

1099
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:23,490
very interesting and that's a great
finding.

1100
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:26,490
I mean more than a hundred percent first
time in days three.

1101
01:02:26,850 --> 01:02:31,850
That's a great finding I think,
and it shows that we are able to have

1102
01:02:32,491 --> 01:02:36,840
more oxygen inside.
Suddenly we are able to get into the

1103
01:02:36,841 --> 01:02:41,820
cell influence energy and energy
production,

1104
01:02:41,821 --> 01:02:46,821
the ATP that those are molecules and if
it is an aerobic then it's like two

1105
01:02:49,411 --> 01:02:54,411
molecules are able to produce.
When it becomes Arabic,

1106
01:02:55,380 --> 01:02:59,430
then it's up to 38 molecules that can
produce,

1107
01:02:59,610 --> 01:03:03,600
that is energy and we are able to
produce more oxygen.

1108
01:03:04,020 --> 01:03:08,160
What happens,
what happens with a cell that is

1109
01:03:08,161 --> 01:03:13,161
deprived for 48 hours of 35 percent less
oxygen?

1110
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:18,360
It becomes cancerous.
Real.

1111
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:21,330
Yes sir.
And as simple as that,

1112
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:23,520
have you ever worked with cancer
patients?

1113
01:03:24,030 --> 01:03:27,390
I want to now with the universities,
but it's very,

1114
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:32,160
very difficult.
Complicated matter and everybody thinks

1115
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:34,320
it's not able to,
uh,

1116
01:03:34,540 --> 01:03:39,540
be
questioned or a research imperative to

1117
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:42,510
these people get medication because
their lives on the line.

1118
01:03:42,510 --> 01:03:47,100
They could die thousand dollar a year.
Those are good clients.

1119
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:48,850
What's 200,000?
Oh,

1120
01:03:48,870 --> 01:03:51,640
the cancer patients.
So they,

1121
01:03:51,790 --> 01:03:54,240
you think that there's an issue where
they don't want to lose that money?

1122
01:03:55,060 --> 01:03:56,100
Right.
What do you think?

1123
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:56,821
Well,
maybe,

1124
01:03:56,821 --> 01:04:00,540
but don't you think there's some
patients out there are some who have

1125
01:04:01,110 --> 01:04:03,070
autonomous control of the.
I got one.

1126
01:04:03,090 --> 01:04:06,630
I got one guy who just gave me a book.
Big Book.

1127
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:11,760
What is his name?
I just gave the book to a professor and

1128
01:04:11,761 --> 01:04:16,761
he cured from terminal cancer.
I met him in 2007.

1129
01:04:17,401 --> 01:04:20,100
He had stage four cancer.
What kind of cancer?

1130
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:24,260
Skin cancer,
which deteriorate all the,

1131
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:26,100
all the skin.
And then you're gone.

1132
01:04:26,990 --> 01:04:31,020
You're not able to function and silver
and he wasn't stage four,

1133
01:04:31,021 --> 01:04:36,021
so almost a terminal and I met him in
2007 then and I told them,

1134
01:04:38,611 --> 01:04:43,611
listen,
what the science is telling you that is

1135
01:04:44,241 --> 01:04:47,040
not really what really is.

1136
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:50,580
It is only what has been found up to
now.

1137
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:54,210
So,
or I found that the autonomic nervous

1138
01:04:54,211 --> 01:04:55,470
system,
for example,

1139
01:04:55,710 --> 01:04:58,800
can be influenced the endocrine system,
the immune system.

1140
01:04:59,180 --> 01:05:03,120
What,
what else and what more don't yield,

1141
01:05:03,690 --> 01:05:07,260
don't yield,
get on and positive thinking they're in

1142
01:05:07,530 --> 01:05:10,080
a positive charges.
That's what,

1143
01:05:10,410 --> 01:05:13,980
but breathing and now it appears to be
that 48

1144
01:05:15,510 --> 01:05:20,510
hours,
35 percent less of oxygen NSL becomes a,

1145
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:25,570
makes a cell cancers.
So what I told you just now that the

1146
01:05:25,571 --> 01:05:28,990
molecules we can influence that,
uh,

1147
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:32,860
the,
the engines of the cell and make much

1148
01:05:32,861 --> 01:05:34,420
more,
uh,

1149
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:39,070
much more molecules by implementing but
jet by breathing.

1150
01:05:39,130 --> 01:05:41,320
Good.
Do reading unbelieving.

1151
01:05:41,380 --> 01:05:45,580
Do you think that it would benefit
people that are already under cancer

1152
01:05:45,581 --> 01:05:48,700
treatment?
Like if they're already in therapy or

1153
01:05:48,701 --> 01:05:50,520
radiation,
you know,

1154
01:05:50,650 --> 01:05:53,950
the chemo actually works better if you
do the breathing techniques.

1155
01:05:53,970 --> 01:05:57,370
Why is that?
It goes more specifically into that

1156
01:05:57,371 --> 01:05:58,204
area.
Boom.

1157
01:05:58,950 --> 01:06:01,180
And Chemo is essentially poison,
right?

1158
01:06:01,250 --> 01:06:02,560
Yes,
it is.

1159
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:05,890
And what I wear if I'm gonna drink here
by the way,

1160
01:06:06,110 --> 01:06:08,920
another little bit or it what would not
be bad.

1161
01:06:10,930 --> 01:06:12,100
Yeah.
My son is saying,

1162
01:06:12,430 --> 01:06:13,151
no,
no,

1163
01:06:13,151 --> 01:06:16,670
don't do it in
listening.

1164
01:06:16,770 --> 01:06:17,990
I got some control.
Yeah.

1165
01:06:17,991 --> 01:06:19,730
I made him tell him to fuck off.
Yeah.

1166
01:06:21,780 --> 01:06:24,740
If it could do that.
Chairs sometimes.

1167
01:06:24,970 --> 01:06:28,030
Yo.
The story goes like this with my son.

1168
01:06:28,450 --> 01:06:32,760
I was in Africa and uh,
on the Kilimanjaro.

1169
01:06:33,220 --> 01:06:38,220
Then after I did a successful attempt in
a $28 and the insurance and everything

1170
01:06:39,970 --> 01:06:44,500
got to tell something about Scott County
to an investigative journalist who came

1171
01:06:44,501 --> 01:06:49,501
to get me a disguised as a guru and a
with lies and everything he disguised.

1172
01:06:52,930 --> 01:06:56,350
I know he wanted to do you say an
investigative journalist and

1173
01:06:56,351 --> 01:07:01,030
anthropologist and he came to Poland to
see who I am for real.

1174
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:04,280
He,
he is into finding out how to uh,

1175
01:07:04,390 --> 01:07:09,390
the organ trafficking goes and these
gurus who will make people do things.

1176
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:11,440
He thought you were one of those?
Yes.

1177
01:07:11,441 --> 01:07:11,880
Yes.

1178
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:15,580
Why?
Because he was paid to do,

1179
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:18,860
to,
to get to me and investigate him,

1180
01:07:19,990 --> 01:07:24,990
but his attitude is the guy who was
publishing his books and he made a new

1181
01:07:27,641 --> 01:07:32,330
book her lately,
but he came to Poland and uh,

1182
01:07:32,380 --> 01:07:34,540
two days later he was doing the same
shit.

1183
01:07:34,570 --> 01:07:38,620
I'm doing that so much.
I didn't end up on the outside though.

1184
01:07:38,910 --> 01:07:43,450
We'll do see someone like you that makes
all these crazy claims and you know,

1185
01:07:43,460 --> 01:07:45,430
talks about love and breathing and go,
oh,

1186
01:07:45,431 --> 01:07:48,790
this guy's all about trying to fuck
everybody's wives and make a lot of

1187
01:07:48,791 --> 01:07:49,391
money.
No,

1188
01:07:49,391 --> 01:07:49,780
no,
no.

1189
01:07:49,780 --> 01:07:51,060
Just I'm very,
uh,

1190
01:07:52,350 --> 01:07:52,990
I know.
But that's,

1191
01:07:52,990 --> 01:07:53,650
that's.
Yes.

1192
01:07:53,650 --> 01:07:55,450
I know you were legitimate.
I know you are,

1193
01:07:55,630 --> 01:07:58,990
but there's a lot of people like you can
understand why he would touch a lot of

1194
01:07:58,991 --> 01:08:02,890
people who make these grand claims turn
out to be,

1195
01:08:02,940 --> 01:08:03,701
um,
you know,

1196
01:08:03,701 --> 01:08:05,710
there's a lot of people that can claim
miracle claims.

1197
01:08:05,711 --> 01:08:06,730
They usually crazy,
right?

1198
01:08:06,770 --> 01:08:07,630
Yes,
yes,

1199
01:08:07,631 --> 01:08:10,420
yes.
So I went with this investigative

1200
01:08:10,421 --> 01:08:15,421
journalist and he became a fool adept.
And did he give up the ghost?

1201
01:08:15,801 --> 01:08:17,600
Did he tell you what he's doing?
He totally,

1202
01:08:17,601 --> 01:08:22,601
totally took two days to disappear,
his distance and all,

1203
01:08:22,940 --> 01:08:27,050
and then he was also in his shorts on
bare barefoot in the snow.

1204
01:08:29,510 --> 01:08:32,200
Is that what are you doing there?
Just move it.

1205
01:08:33,830 --> 01:08:35,530
I can teach.
You can teach them.

1206
01:08:36,620 --> 01:08:38,840
Maybe not.
Maybe you can teach me to teach me.

1207
01:08:39,310 --> 01:08:42,260
Sometimes I think you can teach me some
techniques,

1208
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:47,510
but I can teach you for sure.
Altos some techniques like standing for

1209
01:08:47,511 --> 01:08:50,420
two hours,
barefoot in the snow,

1210
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:53,360
in your shorts and in the horse stance.
Yeah.

1211
01:08:53,450 --> 01:08:55,580
You're not going to teach me that.
No,

1212
01:08:55,700 --> 01:08:56,660
no.
Not doing that.

1213
01:08:57,190 --> 01:08:59,300
It could be.
I believe it can be done.

1214
01:08:59,450 --> 01:08:59,871
Yeah.
Look,

1215
01:08:59,871 --> 01:09:02,780
if I had to do it,
I felt like I feel like I could do it if

1216
01:09:02,781 --> 01:09:03,830
I had to do it.
Yes.

1217
01:09:03,890 --> 01:09:05,900
Would I do it?
I'm busy.

1218
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:06,951
Yeah.
Yeah.

1219
01:09:06,951 --> 01:09:11,951
Yeah.
Were for two days your underwear wax on,

1220
01:09:13,071 --> 01:09:15,410
wax off,
laughing,

1221
01:09:15,460 --> 01:09:19,250
stuck.
But many people do this and they

1222
01:09:19,251 --> 01:09:23,630
suddenly see that they are capable of
doing so much more because they begin to

1223
01:09:23,631 --> 01:09:28,631
learn to control the acidity that what
becomes acidic in their bodies.

1224
01:09:28,900 --> 01:09:32,120
So the performance and for that I do
that.

1225
01:09:32,780 --> 01:09:37,780
So he did it and together with me last
January it was also on the Kilimanjaro.

1226
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:40,220
You stay friends?
Yes.

1227
01:09:40,221 --> 01:09:44,450
Yes.
He wrote a book that what doesn't kill

1228
01:09:44,451 --> 01:09:47,510
you?
It says it will come out next month or

1229
01:09:47,511 --> 01:09:48,830
something.
And it is about you.

1230
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:52,250
It's mostly about what I do.
The method?

1231
01:09:52,550 --> 01:09:53,383
Yes.
Yeah.

1232
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:55,760
And that I worked at [inaudible].
He's a,

1233
01:09:55,790 --> 01:10:00,110
he's a scientist and he is an
anthropologist but he is always trying

1234
01:10:00,111 --> 01:10:05,111
out the stuff he's writing about.
So we got into this and there's a very

1235
01:10:05,601 --> 01:10:07,000
nice book.
Maybe you shoot.

1236
01:10:07,220 --> 01:10:09,590
He,
he's got a teaser on is very nice,

1237
01:10:09,980 --> 01:10:13,160
but I'd love to have them on.
Hey,

1238
01:10:14,470 --> 01:10:15,950
Scott Carney.
Okay,

1239
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:18,230
well let me know and we'll,
we'll talk after the show.

1240
01:10:18,231 --> 01:10:19,850
Let me know like when the book's going
to come out.

1241
01:10:19,990 --> 01:10:21,150
Yes and no,
I'll try it.

1242
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:23,600
There is a teaser and you see it all.

1243
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:25,550
Awesome.
I think it's very,

1244
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:29,260
uh,
it's beautiful and it's very good for a

1245
01:10:29,270 --> 01:10:34,270
human for anybody to see.
And he lost weight very fast and it

1246
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:41,960
could do now are 80 pushups without
breathing.

1247
01:10:42,370 --> 01:10:44,900
[inaudible] 80 pushups without
breathing.

1248
01:10:44,930 --> 01:10:46,850
He was an intellectual list.
Yes.

1249
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:48,930
He can hold his breath and do 80
pushups.

1250
01:10:48,970 --> 01:10:51,650
Yeah,
so I find that very hard to believe with

1251
01:10:51,651 --> 01:10:53,480
no air in the lungs,
by the way.

1252
01:10:53,540 --> 01:10:54,210
No.
What?

1253
01:10:54,210 --> 01:10:56,080
No air in the lungs.
No,

1254
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:58,430
he goes,
really?

1255
01:10:58,730 --> 01:11:03,050
He goes down nowhere in the long blows
out of the air and then there's eight

1256
01:11:03,051 --> 01:11:04,820
zero pushups in a row.
Yes sir.

1257
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:06,270
I call bullshit.
Yeah.

1258
01:11:06,620 --> 01:11:09,980
And I do it the ultimate it was this guy
look like,

1259
01:11:10,180 --> 01:11:11,470
Eh,
I don't know,

1260
01:11:11,690 --> 01:11:15,780
maybe as wide as the fucking savage,
just to be able to do 80 pushups,

1261
01:11:15,810 --> 01:11:17,790
periods,
control of oxygen.

1262
01:11:17,791 --> 01:11:20,790
You can do one pushup because you are
alkaline,

1263
01:11:21,150 --> 01:11:24,450
but if you are able to maintain the
alkalinity in the buddy,

1264
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:26,550
hey,
there you go.

1265
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,280
Is there a video?
This guy doing 80 push pushups with no

1266
01:11:29,370 --> 01:11:32,280
oxygen in his lungs.
I believe him.

1267
01:11:32,310 --> 01:11:36,690
I saw him do math at least 50 in my
time,

1268
01:11:36,930 --> 01:11:39,930
but he went off and I see too many
people,

1269
01:11:40,410 --> 01:11:45,410
but I see older people with roof with
arthritis who cannot do any push up and

1270
01:11:46,740 --> 01:11:51,740
I make them do 40 pushups in in one day.
Why?

1271
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:56,340
Because we controlled the flammatory
markers in the blood,

1272
01:11:56,490 --> 01:12:00,060
suppressing them,
and suddenly they are able and with the

1273
01:12:00,061 --> 01:12:02,400
extra oxygen,
making it alkaline.

1274
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:08,240
The muscle tissue keeps on throwing
these as a teal holiness the neuro

1275
01:12:08,561 --> 01:12:13,230
transmitter performance and they
surprised themselves,

1276
01:12:13,231 --> 01:12:17,100
astonished themselves,
but that just seems like a lot of

1277
01:12:17,101 --> 01:12:20,010
pushups do with no air in your lungs.
What does it say here?

1278
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:24,330
I can do 80 pushups on a single breath
and I lost seven pounds of belly fat and

1279
01:12:24,331 --> 01:12:25,810
70 days,
motherfucker there.

1280
01:12:26,250 --> 01:12:29,490
You know,
I'm not an athlete.

1281
01:12:29,491 --> 01:12:30,720
I'm not exceptional.
Listen Bitch,

1282
01:12:30,750 --> 01:12:32,580
if you could do 80 pushups in a single
breath,

1283
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:35,190
that's fucking exceptional.
I want to know what he's calling a

1284
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:37,350
pushup if he's one of these
motherfuckers.

1285
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:38,520
No,
no,

1286
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:39,140
no,
no doubt.

1287
01:12:39,140 --> 01:12:40,120
Yeah,
let.

1288
01:12:40,220 --> 01:12:41,053
Let.
Let him.

1289
01:12:42,470 --> 01:12:43,470
I want to see this.
I want to see you

1290
01:12:47,730 --> 01:12:47,970
then

1291
01:12:47,970 --> 01:12:49,360
I call bullshit.
Okay,

1292
01:12:49,470 --> 01:12:51,810
touch your chin,
chin,

1293
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:54,360
go back up all the way up,
lock it out.

1294
01:12:55,050 --> 01:12:58,590
Yeah.
Then it takes about at least two minutes

1295
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:01,280
to do that.
Then you asked him to,

1296
01:13:01,540 --> 01:13:02,590
uh,
to uh,

1297
01:13:02,650 --> 01:13:05,230
while you're exercising at least.
Right?

1298
01:13:05,330 --> 01:13:07,290
I think I couldn't do one.
I couldn't do that.

1299
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:10,560
You can do that right now.
You do 80 pushups on a single breath.

1300
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:13,050
You would know.
You think so?

1301
01:13:14,490 --> 01:13:15,780
I don't know.
Let's try it.

1302
01:13:15,810 --> 01:13:19,560
Why don't you try it and you to me too.
I know I can't do it.

1303
01:13:20,310 --> 01:13:22,080
I can't do 80 pushups on a single
breath.

1304
01:13:22,110 --> 01:13:23,250
I'll tell you right now.
I can't do it.

1305
01:13:23,810 --> 01:13:26,670
So wait.
Were we don't need to prove this now

1306
01:13:26,950 --> 01:13:28,800
while this thing is time.
Now's a good time.

1307
01:13:29,210 --> 01:13:32,040
But we will,
we will wait.

1308
01:13:32,041 --> 01:13:33,810
Well,
another thing,

1309
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:36,900
actually I wanted to come back because
we do it.

1310
01:13:37,350 --> 01:13:40,220
I'm telling a story about my son.
Oh,

1311
01:13:40,290 --> 01:13:44,310
that's the old original step.
So the guy was trying to investigate

1312
01:13:44,311 --> 01:13:47,490
you.
He thought you were a fake gurus and we

1313
01:13:47,491 --> 01:13:51,030
did in 28 hours,
they kill him with our lives to January

1314
01:13:51,110 --> 01:13:53,100
insured.
And he did it too,

1315
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:56,010
right?
So a very nice and all done,

1316
01:13:56,070 --> 01:13:59,220
but then later when we did it
accomplish,

1317
01:13:59,221 --> 01:14:04,221
I mean the biggest feat was the 76 year
old man doing the kingdom on channel 44

1318
01:14:06,780 --> 01:14:08,550
hours.
That's A.

1319
01:14:08,860 --> 01:14:10,110
Yeah,
it's unheard off.

1320
01:14:10,740 --> 01:14:12,010
And he did it anyway.
And

1321
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:15,100
with them we are 26 other people,
men,

1322
01:14:15,101 --> 01:14:16,390
women,
old young.

1323
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:18,313
We did.
It will,

1324
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:23,360
how it's taken them 44 hours to do this
climb and timing to the top and.

1325
01:14:25,980 --> 01:14:28,060
Yeah.
But I mean like how many miles is it?

1326
01:14:28,090 --> 01:14:31,450
How many?
Seven miles in 40.

1327
01:14:31,451 --> 01:14:33,330
Four hours.
It's a lot of gold.

1328
01:14:33,390 --> 01:14:36,670
Went up hiking and extreme altitude,
right?

1329
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:38,980
Yes.
Why don't you Google?

1330
01:14:39,220 --> 01:14:42,010
What's the world record pushups for a
single breath?

1331
01:14:42,740 --> 01:14:44,260
Turns out 60.
Hey,

1332
01:14:44,950 --> 01:14:48,010
if it is exactly that,
we got the new world record coming up.

1333
01:14:50,410 --> 01:14:54,850
So you were saying your son?
Yes.

1334
01:14:55,090 --> 01:14:56,380
Right.
So afterwards,

1335
01:14:56,381 --> 01:15:01,381
when we did it and accomplish it to last
January I went to is through to these

1336
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:04,780
natural reserves and uh,
yeah.

1337
01:15:04,781 --> 01:15:09,530
You know,
you got the Serengeti Russia a no go on.

1338
01:15:09,550 --> 01:15:12,820
Goto a crater with the lions and
everything.

1339
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:15,040
I do things with the Messiah.
He as well.

1340
01:15:15,190 --> 01:15:16,000
Can I ask you this?

1341
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,160
Did you take malaria medication when you
went there?

1342
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:19,020
No.
No.

1343
01:15:19,470 --> 01:15:21,280
Will you,
were you there when the mosquitoes were

1344
01:15:21,281 --> 01:15:23,440
around show?
They always around.

1345
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:25,470
He didn't worry about malaria?
No.

1346
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:30,500
They cause inflammation,
so I think I'm able to deal with that,

1347
01:15:30,580 --> 01:15:34,120
so I take a little deal with malaria.
Absolutely.

1348
01:15:34,300 --> 01:15:35,260
Wow.
Yeah,

1349
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:36,280
right.
Man,

1350
01:15:36,281 --> 01:15:38,800
I'm.
I'm open for any research and

1351
01:15:38,801 --> 01:15:40,560
investigation.
I believe in,

1352
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:43,990
in,
in Mother Nature and Mother Nature came

1353
01:15:43,991 --> 01:15:48,991
to me and I got so much field work done.
I know all the tricks of Mother Nature

1354
01:15:49,930 --> 01:15:54,690
and what it does in the body and we
forgot about it because we never expose

1355
01:15:54,691 --> 01:15:59,200
ourselves in mother nature anymore.
We always take the choice of comfort,

1356
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:03,640
right?
But we actually built to be stimulated

1357
01:16:03,641 --> 01:16:06,340
by wind,
cold heat,

1358
01:16:07,450 --> 01:16:11,530
pressure differences and all kinds of
things and that makes us strong.

1359
01:16:11,531 --> 01:16:14,770
It makes our immune system strong and
then bacteria,

1360
01:16:14,771 --> 01:16:19,771
viruses and back so suddenly have a lot
less chance to get in and do their

1361
01:16:20,140 --> 01:16:20,973
damage.

1362
01:16:21,550 --> 01:16:24,070
And at this it's a fact.
It's not me.

1363
01:16:24,071 --> 01:16:28,240
It's mother nature within us and that
control we lost because we lost the

1364
01:16:28,241 --> 01:16:31,900
connection and uh,
it's very important to bring that.

1365
01:16:32,140 --> 01:16:34,590
And I think malaria.
Yes,

1366
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:37,930
we can now,
not only,

1367
01:16:38,750 --> 01:16:43,750
it's also in the books now in hey,
possibly a university books.

1368
01:16:45,250 --> 01:16:48,730
Possibly hope for people with HIV.
I have a friend,

1369
01:16:48,731 --> 01:16:52,180
my friend Justin Wren,
he does a lot of work with the pygmies.

1370
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:57,160
He works with water four and he builds
wells in the Congo and he's had malaria

1371
01:16:57,161 --> 01:17:01,750
three times and when he gets it,
it's pretty bad and not only does he get

1372
01:17:01,751 --> 01:17:03,550
it,
but now because he's had it so many

1373
01:17:03,551 --> 01:17:05,110
times,
he gets it if he gets sick.

1374
01:17:05,410 --> 01:17:08,680
So when he's in America,
if he catches the flu or something like

1375
01:17:08,681 --> 01:17:10,070
that,
he also gets malaria.

1376
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:12,290
It's happened.
Flammatory markers,

1377
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:15,020
deregulation of the immune system that
you could help him.

1378
01:17:15,230 --> 01:17:16,820
Yes sir.
I need to.

1379
01:17:17,340 --> 01:17:19,190
I need to connect you to.
Absolutely.

1380
01:17:19,191 --> 01:17:20,130
Absolutely.
Okay.

1381
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:24,270
Before you leave,
I'm going to get you his information.

1382
01:17:24,350 --> 01:17:28,880
I'm swap information with you guys.
I think that'd be amazing if you could

1383
01:17:28,881 --> 01:17:32,510
actually help him because he's,
he's amazing.

1384
01:17:32,540 --> 01:17:34,220
He's done amazing,
amazing stuff.

1385
01:17:34,221 --> 01:17:36,680
I mean,
that guy spends months at a time.

1386
01:17:36,681 --> 01:17:39,060
Yeah,
I can't imagine he's a pioneer.

1387
01:17:39,170 --> 01:17:43,010
Oh Man.
He's going to feel like we began off.

1388
01:17:43,100 --> 01:17:47,610
Those are the people dose I man looking
for more to,

1389
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:51,740
to do a valid per whatever we go for as
human mankind,

1390
01:17:52,270 --> 01:17:57,270
and to finally get into some love,
like a sharing and caring tribal.

1391
01:17:58,250 --> 01:18:00,680
So what happened when your son?
Yes.

1392
01:18:00,870 --> 01:18:04,640
So I went through this reserve,
big Serengeti,

1393
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:10,160
and then you got these big elephants.
Luxor don't or Luxor don't.

1394
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:12,430
Africana know big stuff.
I know.

1395
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:14,070
Elephants,
eh?

1396
01:18:14,110 --> 01:18:17,270
They can go up to seven tons of meat.

1397
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:22,840
So they.
I went to a lot of these big elephants

1398
01:18:24,940 --> 01:18:29,940
and I lifted up there till two in the
back and to see how big the asshole is.

1399
01:18:30,470 --> 01:18:34,740
Oh Wow.
I saw a lot of big hassles.

1400
01:18:34,970 --> 01:18:39,970
My son is still the and
I made the phone call.

1401
01:18:41,510 --> 01:18:45,290
It's all about fun because I love to
joke about.

1402
01:18:45,291 --> 01:18:48,800
He is to a very severe with me.
He's like,

1403
01:18:48,850 --> 01:18:51,190
he can be.
He said it's sitting there very to

1404
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:54,520
inquiry,
but he can be like a wolf with her.

1405
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:56,040
Her Dad.
No,

1406
01:18:56,120 --> 01:18:58,760
not yet.
I said I asked him to not talk during

1407
01:18:58,761 --> 01:19:01,310
the show and now you're egging them on
and you're forcing them to defend

1408
01:19:01,311 --> 01:19:03,350
themselves.
That's totally unfair.

1409
01:19:04,650 --> 01:19:08,000
An asshole.
It makes my business,

1410
01:19:08,001 --> 01:19:12,080
you know,
my mission and it makes it able to

1411
01:19:12,081 --> 01:19:15,230
happen in this world because I'm not of
this world.

1412
01:19:15,231 --> 01:19:16,580
I'm too much of nature.

1413
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:21,080
I'm so naive.
But he is outlining everything with

1414
01:19:21,090 --> 01:19:24,710
websites of activity to people who are
not of this world.

1415
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:30,280
I mean a lot of the modern world
electronics and that shit you just not

1416
01:19:31,930 --> 01:19:33,140
to.
Do you have a cell phone?

1417
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:34,500
Yes.
Yeah,

1418
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:35,510
Duh.
Duh.

1419
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:37,520
I lose them a lot.
And uh,

1420
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:40,910
things like that.
But you know,

1421
01:19:40,911 --> 01:19:44,180
what happened with the cell phones a in
Finland,

1422
01:19:44,330 --> 01:19:47,200
lapland or [inaudible],
Alaska where they live,

1423
01:19:47,300 --> 01:19:49,850
uh,
in distance with each other.

1424
01:19:50,570 --> 01:19:54,140
Telepathy is.
And where there's no cell phones.

1425
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:56,240
Yeah.
Where there's no cell phones.

1426
01:19:56,480 --> 01:20:00,090
But since the telephone came,
a introduce itself over there,

1427
01:20:00,850 --> 01:20:03,380
the people lost this ability.
What do you mean?

1428
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:03,890
Like,
um,

1429
01:20:03,890 --> 01:20:08,010
what they knew every time one day a
neighbor is coming

1430
01:20:08,930 --> 01:20:13,430
that are already setting things up
without seeing it with the eyes and ears

1431
01:20:13,980 --> 01:20:16,360
and that's common.
What is that?

1432
01:20:16,890 --> 01:20:21,890
D Cell phones game and they take it over
and we have to learn that we all have

1433
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:26,960
these not only physiological abilities
deeper but also in the mind a beautiful

1434
01:20:29,521 --> 01:20:34,521
things and we are having it taken over
by tech technical devices and all that.

1435
01:20:37,740 --> 01:20:42,670
But whereas the contact with our
conscious contact with our depth,

1436
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:45,380
what is it?
And I'm going for it.

1437
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:48,570
But is there any evidence these people
were really telepathic?

1438
01:20:50,850 --> 01:20:52,920
No,
it's anecdotal of course,

1439
01:20:52,950 --> 01:20:55,940
of course.
But people full of shit out there living

1440
01:20:55,960 --> 01:21:00,340
by themselves just doing weird shit to
themselves out there screaming.

1441
01:21:00,860 --> 01:21:03,960
No one answers.
Lone wolves howl.

1442
01:21:04,260 --> 01:21:06,810
There was a too old.
Yeah,

1443
01:21:06,811 --> 01:21:09,030
you gotta take that into account.
People are full of Shit.

1444
01:21:09,310 --> 01:21:12,630
You got.
There was an old television show on the

1445
01:21:12,631 --> 01:21:15,510
road.
Do you remember on the road with Charles

1446
01:21:15,510 --> 01:21:16,343
Kuralt?
Is that who it was?

1447
01:21:17,130 --> 01:21:19,950
There was a guy that used to have this
television shows way back in the day

1448
01:21:19,951 --> 01:21:22,200
before the Internet.
I remember he had this episode on

1449
01:21:22,201 --> 01:21:24,420
whether it was talking to this guy who
was a.

1450
01:21:25,050 --> 01:21:30,050
He was a trapper and he would live in
the Bush and Alaska and he would live

1451
01:21:30,781 --> 01:21:35,250
there and not talk to a single person
for months and months at a time,

1452
01:21:35,580 --> 01:21:40,580
and what he would say is that after a
while when he was out there by himself,

1453
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:45,980
he would develop this very bizarre
feeling of telepathic,

1454
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:51,120
of telepathy with animals and that he
could read animals minds.

1455
01:21:51,190 --> 01:21:55,320
You could almost predict their behavior
and movements and he was getting signals

1456
01:21:55,321 --> 01:22:00,321
from them that he couldn't describe and
when he would go back to the town,

1457
01:22:01,530 --> 01:22:03,090
when he would come back after six
months,

1458
01:22:03,091 --> 01:22:06,000
after a couple of hours or a day or so,
it would go away.

1459
01:22:06,690 --> 01:22:10,140
And it was like whatever.
That thing was interesting when he had

1460
01:22:10,141 --> 01:22:12,590
no contact with people and he swore by
it.

1461
01:22:12,620 --> 01:22:15,600
But again,
it could be a fucking crazy dude out

1462
01:22:15,601 --> 01:22:16,434
there.
You know,

1463
01:22:16,990 --> 01:22:18,930
the Muskrat's with a giant trap.

1464
01:22:19,130 --> 01:22:23,720
It's anecdotal.
We are social mammals,

1465
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:26,630
mammalian behavior like families and
things like that,

1466
01:22:26,930 --> 01:22:27,550
but I've read that

1467
01:22:27,550 --> 01:22:32,550
I have found one thing that they're
pretty sure that people can tell and

1468
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:34,730
that is hard.
It's very hard.

1469
01:22:34,750 --> 01:22:36,760
It was rupert sheldrake's podcast he was
talking about.

1470
01:22:37,210 --> 01:22:42,210
He was saying that one thing that they
have studied beyond statistical

1471
01:22:42,371 --> 01:22:46,090
probability,
it shows that when people are stared at,

1472
01:22:46,540 --> 01:22:50,580
like say if you,
if I turned my back and um,

1473
01:22:50,740 --> 01:22:55,000
you either would look down at your lap
or look at the back of my head that I

1474
01:22:55,001 --> 01:22:59,980
could tell or someone maybe some people
can tell whether or not you're looking

1475
01:22:59,981 --> 01:23:04,981
at them more than half the time.
They were more accurate than guessing.

1476
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:08,980
And it was consistent.
It was pretty consistent.

1477
01:23:09,220 --> 01:23:13,510
It wasn't 100 percent of the time,
but it wasn't 50 slash 50.

1478
01:23:13,570 --> 01:23:17,150
It was more like 70,
30 rupert cherish held,

1479
01:23:17,151 --> 01:23:17,940
right?
Yes.

1480
01:23:17,940 --> 01:23:20,140
Interesting things he tells.
By the way,

1481
01:23:20,220 --> 01:23:22,240
that's an interesting guy.
You know what,

1482
01:23:22,290 --> 01:23:23,230
when the birds

1483
01:23:23,350 --> 01:23:26,050
in in say,
the Second World War,

1484
01:23:26,530 --> 01:23:27,311
uh,
uh,

1485
01:23:27,311 --> 01:23:32,311
getting into these mil bottles with a
silver top,

1486
01:23:33,490 --> 01:23:35,890
they learned to pick through
[inaudible].

1487
01:23:36,970 --> 01:23:40,990
And the day,
the distance between say England and the

1488
01:23:40,991 --> 01:23:45,991
Netherlands or Germany,
etc. Is a divided by a northern city and

1489
01:23:47,681 --> 01:23:52,300
these words are not able to travel the
other side to the other side,

1490
01:23:52,900 --> 01:23:57,640
but the same birds were able,
the same species of birds at the other

1491
01:23:57,641 --> 01:24:00,560
side were able to,
uh,

1492
01:24:00,610 --> 01:24:01,990
day began to do the same.

1493
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:05,730
Yeah,
he has a term wIth monkeys and fall age

1494
01:24:05,790 --> 01:24:08,650
or resonance,
morphic resonance.

1495
01:24:08,680 --> 01:24:13,240
And what he believes is that when one
member of the species attempts to learn

1496
01:24:13,241 --> 01:24:18,130
something or learn something,
it becomes far easier for other members

1497
01:24:18,131 --> 01:24:22,810
of the species even that are separated
by vast distances to learn that.

1498
01:24:22,811 --> 01:24:27,811
And I think he said that occurred with
rats in a very particular maze that they

1499
01:24:27,881 --> 01:24:31,360
would teach rats how to get through a
particular maize in one part of the

1500
01:24:31,361 --> 01:24:32,980
world.
And then rats and the other part of the

1501
01:24:32,981 --> 01:24:37,180
world navigated it much quicker.
There's some interesting stuff when it

1502
01:24:37,181 --> 01:24:38,290
comes to that stuff.
I mean,

1503
01:24:39,110 --> 01:24:40,570
interesting.
It is interesting,

1504
01:24:40,571 --> 01:24:43,540
but it's hard because there's a lot of
people call bullshit and I don't know

1505
01:24:43,541 --> 01:24:46,000
who's right.
And you gotta kinda go over it with a

1506
01:24:46,001 --> 01:24:51,001
fine tooth comb and look at everybody's
looking at their motivations and look at

1507
01:24:51,551 --> 01:24:55,000
whether or not they're biased and it's
very difficult to sort out.

1508
01:24:55,150 --> 01:24:58,180
But rupert seems like a very thoughtful,
very interesting guy.

1509
01:24:58,210 --> 01:24:59,890
He definitely didn't seem dishonest.

1510
01:25:00,130 --> 01:25:02,050
Mm hmm.
So yeah.

1511
01:25:02,590 --> 01:25:07,230
I'm here to,
to say a little bit about what we did.

1512
01:25:07,510 --> 01:25:08,343
Yeah.
Tell me

1513
01:25:10,260 --> 01:25:15,260
a censure last year so that the goals
now are to get it into a national

1514
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:21,580
healthcare.
Actually any every country but in

1515
01:25:21,750 --> 01:25:24,550
America is a little bit a leader there
in.

1516
01:25:25,060 --> 01:25:28,900
And I'm beginning to become quite
famous.

1517
01:25:29,620 --> 01:25:31,420
I use it,
I use it,

1518
01:25:31,421 --> 01:25:35,230
abuse it to get my goals done,
my mission done,

1519
01:25:35,650 --> 01:25:40,650
which is bringing a belief,
a confidence love,

1520
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:47,170
but now scientifically endorsed.
showing that we are able to tap into all

1521
01:25:47,171 --> 01:25:51,730
those systems and we should actually get
it in school,

1522
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:57,120
in primary school to begin with.
And not only learn like history and

1523
01:25:57,881 --> 01:26:02,881
geography and things like that,
but now learn at a young age

1524
01:26:04,340 --> 01:26:09,340
how to influence into this hormonal
system and immune system or say

1525
01:26:12,020 --> 01:26:13,310
happiness,
strength,

1526
01:26:13,550 --> 01:26:18,550
health shoot be subjects.
And I teach kids of four years old with

1527
01:26:21,290 --> 01:26:24,920
arthritis.
They come and they are very able to do

1528
01:26:24,921 --> 01:26:29,090
breathing exercises going into cold,
actually children.

1529
01:26:29,330 --> 01:26:34,220
We teach him to have coal,
john and therefore,

1530
01:26:34,290 --> 01:26:36,530
uh,
taken away the stimulation of the

1531
01:26:36,531 --> 01:26:40,850
natural element,
thus decreasing the activity of their

1532
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:45,800
systems inside.
We make them sick instead of protecting

1533
01:26:45,801 --> 01:26:48,200
them,
we are comforting them.

1534
01:26:48,470 --> 01:26:51,590
And we think that paradigm shift needs
to happen.

1535
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:56,920
And I'm into that and now it's getting
together with a existent healthcare.

1536
01:26:58,070 --> 01:27:03,070
And with universities more and more,
I think we got to go back to say nature.

1537
01:27:05,121 --> 01:27:10,121
And if her mother is able to guarantee
by endorsed by scientific evidence that

1538
01:27:12,201 --> 01:27:16,430
we are able to tap in to all these
systems guaranteeing,

1539
01:27:16,790 --> 01:27:19,880
hey,
if you just breathe better and take a

1540
01:27:19,881 --> 01:27:24,881
cold shower and believe connect with
your body that you are able to tap into

1541
01:27:27,111 --> 01:27:31,340
your health,
your happiness and your strength,

1542
01:27:31,910 --> 01:27:36,910
then that's something that will bring
mother nature back in us and awareness

1543
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:41,250
there,
uh,

1544
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:46,280
uh,
from will make this world a value.

1545
01:27:47,190 --> 01:27:52,190
The nature outside as inside.
because we lost a connection.

1546
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:58,640
And I'm now here to bring that.
And since last year I've progressed,

1547
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:01,460
you know,
things like anxiety and fear,

1548
01:28:01,461 --> 01:28:04,520
nobody knows about.
Now I do know what it is.

1549
01:28:04,910 --> 01:28:09,440
I know what it is,
is biochemical and neurological.

1550
01:28:09,710 --> 01:28:12,840
I talk with professors,
I teach them the,

1551
01:28:12,910 --> 01:28:13,551
uh,
they,

1552
01:28:13,551 --> 01:28:16,930
uh,
teach me their language and I teach them

1553
01:28:17,030 --> 01:28:20,330
the method and together we get a more
out of it.

1554
01:28:20,850 --> 01:28:22,850
Uh,
it's all happening.

1555
01:28:23,540 --> 01:28:24,373
So,
uh,

1556
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:29,400
I'm very thankful to be here with you.
I still got a joke.

1557
01:28:30,590 --> 01:28:31,820
A joke.
Yes.

1558
01:28:32,690 --> 01:28:35,190
I wanted to say this big ass too.
Yeah,

1559
01:28:35,290 --> 01:28:37,400
that's,
that's another one.

1560
01:28:38,180 --> 01:28:42,650
A little bit thankful to have you here
to really am a very.

1561
01:28:42,680 --> 01:28:44,540
I'm very appreciative.
It's not a whole lot of people that all

1562
01:28:44,541 --> 01:28:48,560
do a late night podcast with.
but you anytime.

1563
01:28:48,770 --> 01:28:50,090
Thanks.
Thanks joe.

1564
01:28:51,230 --> 01:28:53,480
That's great.
And I must say,

1565
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:57,170
and me,
my podcast with you,

1566
01:28:57,650 --> 01:29:00,500
so many people,
I didn't know who you were.

1567
01:29:01,110 --> 01:29:06,110
I never give a fuck who I go to,
but when I get there and it starts,

1568
01:29:07,050 --> 01:29:10,050
my mirror is the people who are
commanding.

1569
01:29:10,980 --> 01:29:12,260
I never looked.
Yeah,

1570
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:15,150
yeah.
I'm not looking for a job now or

1571
01:29:15,170 --> 01:29:17,010
whatever,
but I never go with a program.

1572
01:29:17,011 --> 01:29:20,670
I don't know.
They never give me too much information

1573
01:29:20,680 --> 01:29:23,570
either.
My adults taught my children that they

1574
01:29:23,580 --> 01:29:25,620
work with me.
They take god.

1575
01:29:25,621 --> 01:29:27,270
That did a lot.
Let them go.

1576
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:29,560
Well,
I'm curious to see what the responses

1577
01:29:29,580 --> 01:29:32,550
this time because the difference in the
numbers of staggering.

1578
01:29:32,580 --> 01:29:35,430
like what was the.
What was the monthly downloads last

1579
01:29:35,430 --> 01:29:36,263
year?

1580
01:29:37,650 --> 01:29:42,090
Just take a guess.
Probably like 15,

1581
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:47,200
18 million now.
It's well over 40 plus youtube shit.

1582
01:29:48,390 --> 01:29:49,800
Yeah,
it'll be way more.

1583
01:29:50,430 --> 01:29:51,690
It's more than double.
It's good.

1584
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:55,230
That's good because all the world needs
to know about this.

1585
01:29:55,620 --> 01:29:57,360
This is simple.
Accessible,

1586
01:29:57,361 --> 01:30:00,030
effective scientifically and doors.
No speculation.

1587
01:30:00,390 --> 01:30:04,700
It's there,
but now I got this job job.

1588
01:30:04,970 --> 01:30:06,760
I.
I bought it to say that.

1589
01:30:07,350 --> 01:30:10,070
That's.
I'm with Joe Adams.

1590
01:30:10,620 --> 01:30:14,190
I know now a.
You said a comedian before,

1591
01:30:14,310 --> 01:30:17,670
so you can appreciate this.
I got to.

1592
01:30:17,671 --> 01:30:21,300
Joe had.
It's a big.

1593
01:30:21,420 --> 01:30:22,890
He's big.
He's big.

1594
01:30:23,610 --> 01:30:26,040
He's enormous.
He is orange.

1595
01:30:26,070 --> 01:30:29,220
It's so rank attack an orange orangutan?
Yes.

1596
01:30:29,221 --> 01:30:31,200
In the middle of san francisco.
Oh,

1597
01:30:31,410 --> 01:30:34,160
san francisco or los angeles.
We are here,

1598
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:36,010
launch it in a big city.
I mean,

1599
01:30:37,530 --> 01:30:40,260
in a big city,
you don't see orangutans,

1600
01:30:40,290 --> 01:30:41,830
they to go to the zoo,
right.

1601
01:30:41,850 --> 01:30:45,180
I don't know what maybe you know or
whatever.

1602
01:30:45,490 --> 01:30:47,960
Oh,
you traveled incognito and uh,

1603
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:52,050
with a hat on.
And as soon big suit must be a bit,

1604
01:30:52,440 --> 01:30:57,440
but he walks over there and the sun is
shining and it's shining on his long a

1605
01:30:58,330 --> 01:31:01,020
orange hair.
I thought I was gonna say yeah.

1606
01:31:01,030 --> 01:31:02,400
But wait a minute.
HeY,

1607
01:31:02,460 --> 01:31:03,520
still has to come.
I

1608
01:31:05,420 --> 01:31:07,420
shush you over there.
Yeah,

1609
01:31:07,430 --> 01:31:09,360
I told you how to give them beer.
He's like a gremlin.

1610
01:31:09,420 --> 01:31:10,350
Oh yeah,
yeah,

1611
01:31:10,351 --> 01:31:12,300
yeah.
He doesn't know how to control it.

1612
01:31:12,310 --> 01:31:15,100
It's just I'm this chemistry,
he's not on audio.

1613
01:31:15,740 --> 01:31:20,740
Okay.
So he's dripping and ya know,

1614
01:31:21,240 --> 01:31:26,240
davis endocrine system and it's dripping
a long as the orange has and that it's

1615
01:31:26,671 --> 01:31:31,671
flickering together with the sun.
Looks like will our enormous and the

1616
01:31:32,191 --> 01:31:37,191
light is upon it.
And he walks a among the street and a

1617
01:31:41,970 --> 01:31:44,750
big lips.
Big cheek,

1618
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,850
big claws.
Very peaceful.

1619
01:31:48,780 --> 01:31:49,740
He has no enemy.

1620
01:31:50,190 --> 01:31:55,190
He's there just by being himself and
he's easily as a bar.

1621
01:31:56,540 --> 01:31:57,930
And he,
in his mind,

1622
01:31:57,931 --> 01:32:00,160
kept pops up,
chest is

1623
01:32:02,130 --> 01:32:07,130
a golden bear and he sees it within.
He's already driven from it or from his

1624
01:32:10,181 --> 01:32:14,260
lips is coming down and he goes through
the door.

1625
01:32:14,830 --> 01:32:19,690
He's got quite some difficulty to get
through the though because he's so big,

1626
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:25,200
really squeezes himself through the door
and there he sees his stool.

1627
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:31,560
He goes through the stool.
I mean he's really big and the stool is

1628
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:35,460
only so big.
So he's got a,

1629
01:32:35,480 --> 01:32:38,710
he's into a balancing act not to fall
through,

1630
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:39,680
so,
so,

1631
01:32:39,680 --> 01:32:44,050
so big a year.
But finally he gets there and he

1632
01:32:44,051 --> 01:32:47,040
accomplishes this balancing act and he
is there.

1633
01:32:47,130 --> 01:32:49,650
He's at ease.
And of course the bomber.

1634
01:32:50,020 --> 01:32:54,780
We flat into a corner somewhere and he
said,

1635
01:32:55,250 --> 01:32:56,450
hey,
hey,

1636
01:32:57,420 --> 01:32:59,840
hey.
Yeah,

1637
01:33:00,940 --> 01:33:02,950
he's at ease.
He's peaceful.

1638
01:33:02,980 --> 01:33:04,300
He's at ease.
Yeah.

1639
01:33:04,360 --> 01:33:07,440
These pieces.
We'll talk to the bartender zia money

1640
01:33:07,730 --> 01:33:09,490
stealing this beer.
I don't know.

1641
01:33:09,510 --> 01:33:11,890
He has no pockets,
but he has got money.

1642
01:33:11,950 --> 01:33:15,880
I don't know why he stashed it,
but it's there.

1643
01:33:16,620 --> 01:33:17,480
It's there.
All right.

1644
01:33:17,870 --> 01:33:20,620
And uh,
he,

1645
01:33:23,090 --> 01:33:25,960
he's very peaceful.
The orangutan show,

1646
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:31,200
his fear is subsiding and he comes and
still and that he gives us to to like

1647
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:37,320
this and then it gets a bear claw around
this little glass or a golden bear lake.

1648
01:33:41,150 --> 01:33:46,150
We're looking at it
like a little baby.

1649
01:33:48,970 --> 01:33:53,860
He's a dad.
He puts it back

1650
01:33:55,360 --> 01:33:59,230
and he puts a $100 bill on the.
On the bar,

1651
01:33:59,710 --> 01:34:01,580
on the,
on the tap as bar.

1652
01:34:01,950 --> 01:34:03,790
Yeah.
$100.

1653
01:34:03,900 --> 01:34:08,900
Now suddenly the bar man things what?
But because he is a very peaceful.

1654
01:34:09,551 --> 01:34:12,060
Is there.
You enjoy this beer?

1655
01:34:12,820 --> 01:34:17,630
He got a $100.
I think I'm going to give him back at my

1656
01:34:17,631 --> 01:34:21,010
shiny coin because he doesn't know about
the significance of,

1657
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:26,280
of money and he gives him a shiny coat
and he takes the $100 bill and I don't

1658
01:34:30,071 --> 01:34:33,040
know where he puts it because he's got
no pockets,

1659
01:34:33,460 --> 01:34:37,540
but he puts it somewhere.
It looks at it and puts it somewhere and

1660
01:34:37,630 --> 01:34:42,630
he sits there and finally the obama got
his confidence so much.

1661
01:34:43,980 --> 01:34:45,680
He asks you,
hey,

1662
01:34:46,310 --> 01:34:49,750
what about this?
I never ever.

1663
01:34:50,040 --> 01:34:55,040
so a orangutang in my bar.
What is it an orangutan do know what

1664
01:34:58,341 --> 01:35:00,110
kind of prices you are charting

1665
01:35:01,780 --> 01:35:04,700
and that's the punchline and the thing
is,

1666
01:35:06,130 --> 01:35:11,130
the thing is this is the way we think we
can mess up with a trake,

1667
01:35:13,120 --> 01:35:16,910
our inner power.
WhoA,

1668
01:35:17,060 --> 01:35:22,060
we are straw man,
but we always think bad about who we are

1669
01:35:23,030 --> 01:35:23,870
in the depth

1670
01:35:25,270 --> 01:35:30,270
and he is there for you to enjoy life
and to be as strong as mother nature in

1671
01:35:32,141 --> 01:35:33,460
the future.
Yes.

1672
01:35:33,550 --> 01:35:36,010
I would just recommend just tightening
that up a little bit.

1673
01:35:36,120 --> 01:35:38,590
Oh yeah.
It's kind of a funny joke.

1674
01:35:38,760 --> 01:35:41,680
It's kind of funny.
I knew what was coming towards the end,

1675
01:35:41,710 --> 01:35:43,630
but yeah,
I'm a professional comedian.

1676
01:35:43,720 --> 01:35:45,040
Yes.
I knew the joke,

1677
01:35:45,630 --> 01:35:47,770
but joke.
Yeah.

1678
01:35:47,830 --> 01:35:50,940
Well I knew at the end.
I don't even think I'd heard it before,

1679
01:35:50,941 --> 01:35:55,941
but I knew I always extended I that I
now use it as a metaphor because that's

1680
01:35:57,911 --> 01:36:00,700
no joke.
That's real wood.

1681
01:36:01,270 --> 01:36:04,720
What's real?
That's the way we trick with our mind.

1682
01:36:05,290 --> 01:36:10,290
We ca where you think we can trick
mother nature inside our deeper power.

1683
01:36:11,350 --> 01:36:12,390
Eight or power.
Okay.

1684
01:36:13,250 --> 01:36:14,690
I get it.
It just,

1685
01:36:14,691 --> 01:36:16,310
it was a little shorter.
Probably better,

1686
01:36:16,850 --> 01:36:19,330
right jamie?
Yeah.

1687
01:36:19,880 --> 01:36:23,810
I mean it's not a bad joke.
That big asshole jokes a little better.

1688
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:28,520
I think so too.
Washing elephant hit a guy with his

1689
01:36:28,521 --> 01:36:31,430
trunk.
I kinda knew that elephants trunks were

1690
01:36:31,431 --> 01:36:32,960
powerful.
I'm gonna always knew,

1691
01:36:33,380 --> 01:36:34,950
but I had no idea.
I.

1692
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:39,710
This guy got too close to an elephant.
The elephant was eating and it just

1693
01:36:39,711 --> 01:36:44,711
swatted him with its trunk and he went
flipping like head over heels,

1694
01:36:44,871 --> 01:36:47,990
head over heels,
head over heels and it was hilarious.

1695
01:36:48,120 --> 01:36:50,270
He.
He knocked that thing the way you would

1696
01:36:50,271 --> 01:36:52,960
flip a beer.
Oh yeah.

1697
01:36:53,300 --> 01:36:55,430
What does with its trunk?
amazing.

1698
01:36:56,080 --> 01:36:57,590
Do you just the,
the,

1699
01:36:57,591 --> 01:36:59,990
the,
the epic scale of those animals.

1700
01:37:00,020 --> 01:37:04,670
It's just unbelievable when you see the,
the amount of force that they can

1701
01:37:04,671 --> 01:37:06,650
generate with their nose.
Did you see it?

1702
01:37:06,820 --> 01:37:08,750
Yeah.
It should put it up and he didn't check

1703
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:11,630
his eyes went wide.
Is his head snapped back?

1704
01:37:11,631 --> 01:37:12,231
What?
He saw this?

1705
01:37:12,231 --> 01:37:13,730
Watch this.
This guy got too close?

1706
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:14,540
Yes.
Yes.

1707
01:37:14,540 --> 01:37:19,540
He goes to touch it
still.

1708
01:37:23,010 --> 01:37:23,990
Yeah.
He didn't give a fuck.

1709
01:37:23,991 --> 01:37:24,471
He's like,
bitch,

1710
01:37:24,471 --> 01:37:26,720
get outta here.
Like you're bothering me.

1711
01:37:26,980 --> 01:37:29,600
I think as a female,
I didn't even have tusks.

1712
01:37:30,980 --> 01:37:32,390
It's a female or a juvenile,

1713
01:37:33,110 --> 01:37:37,110
but why were we are onto right now with
this research,

1714
01:37:37,120 --> 01:37:39,370
these findings out of,
uh,

1715
01:37:39,490 --> 01:37:43,600
out of nature.
And next time I will get some new

1716
01:37:43,601 --> 01:37:45,190
breakthroughs.
Yeah.

1717
01:37:45,610 --> 01:37:49,100
Yeah.
And we have to see each other again.

1718
01:37:49,110 --> 01:37:50,350
Yeah,
let's do every october.

1719
01:37:50,351 --> 01:37:51,330
Yeah.
It,

1720
01:37:51,700 --> 01:37:54,370
we didn't even play.
Let's make a deal deal october.

1721
01:37:54,400 --> 01:37:55,320
Let's do it.
great.

1722
01:37:55,380 --> 01:37:57,210
We bring that guy in and have them do 80
pushups up.

1723
01:37:57,211 --> 01:37:58,970
Fuck you mean by that?
Oh yeah,

1724
01:37:58,971 --> 01:37:59,770
yeah,
yeah.

1725
01:37:59,770 --> 01:38:03,690
Just a free diving message board.
And there's some people that were asking

1726
01:38:03,691 --> 01:38:05,100
us.
The only thing I found on the entire

1727
01:38:05,101 --> 01:38:05,934
internet,
uh,

1728
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:11,000
some guy claimed he did 72 after taking
that jack three d stuff with one brand

1729
01:38:11,250 --> 01:38:14,700
after taking a five minute breathing
exercise and then no breasts and you did

1730
01:38:14,701 --> 01:38:19,701
72 people so they'd like 40 or 50
breathing would've helped like a similar

1731
01:38:20,131 --> 01:38:21,810
method to this,
but they weren't talking about.

1732
01:38:22,900 --> 01:38:24,790
Yeah,
I have a feeling your friend might be a

1733
01:38:24,791 --> 01:38:26,500
little full of shit.
It just doesn't.

1734
01:38:27,340 --> 01:38:30,880
As an athlete,
as someone who understands the potential

1735
01:38:30,881 --> 01:38:33,430
of the human body,
you have to be extraordinary.

1736
01:38:33,820 --> 01:38:37,120
You have to be pretty extraordinary to
do 80 push ups on your own.

1737
01:38:37,121 --> 01:38:40,300
You have to be conditioned.
It's something like just a force,

1738
01:38:40,301 --> 01:38:42,700
your muscles,
depending upon how much you weigh of

1739
01:38:42,701 --> 01:38:46,020
course,
but if you're the average 175 pound or

1740
01:38:46,060 --> 01:38:50,370
whatever the average man is to just to
force yourself to do 80 pushups,

1741
01:38:50,470 --> 01:38:52,390
you have to be in pretty good condition.
To do that,

1742
01:38:52,450 --> 01:38:55,150
you have to.
That's a lot of repetition.

1743
01:38:55,570 --> 01:38:57,130
You're essentially,
I mean it's not like you're bench

1744
01:38:57,131 --> 01:38:59,470
pressing 175 pounds,
but it's probably like a bench

1745
01:38:59,471 --> 01:39:00,610
precedent.
One 40,

1746
01:39:01,120 --> 01:39:03,610
like how much would you think it would
be like a pushup?

1747
01:39:03,640 --> 01:39:06,250
How much you actually pushing up?
So if I weighed 200 pounds,

1748
01:39:06,550 --> 01:39:09,400
if I'm doing a pushup,
how much am I actually pushing because

1749
01:39:09,401 --> 01:39:12,520
I'm not really pushing 200 pounds
because my feet are on the ground and

1750
01:39:13,030 --> 01:39:14,420
you know,
there's,

1751
01:39:14,460 --> 01:39:19,000
there's some weight down there.
How much am I actually pushing?

1752
01:39:20,020 --> 01:39:25,020
It feels like I'm pushing about 130,
140 pounds when I do a push up

1753
01:39:25,810 --> 01:39:28,420
60 slash 70 percent of your body weight
price.

1754
01:39:28,760 --> 01:39:31,360
I guess.
Why don't you go try to google something

1755
01:39:31,361 --> 01:39:32,194
like google

1756
01:39:32,430 --> 01:39:36,630
percentage of your body weight or you
actually lifting when you do a pushup.

1757
01:39:36,840 --> 01:39:37,920
Interesting.
Yeah,

1758
01:39:37,921 --> 01:39:39,450
because I don't.
It's definitely not a 100

1759
01:39:39,970 --> 01:39:44,970
that's analyze it and I really began
with these pushups and now everybody is

1760
01:39:45,990 --> 01:39:49,310
health course copying and I know what a.
That's all.

1761
01:39:49,311 --> 01:39:52,520
Okay.
But I like to like research.

1762
01:39:52,530 --> 01:39:55,100
I like to investigate what we are really
doing.

1763
01:39:55,150 --> 01:39:55,790
Yeah.

1764
01:39:55,790 --> 01:39:58,160
Here we go.
Forty nine percent.

1765
01:39:58,161 --> 01:39:59,260
Okay.
regular pushup,

1766
01:39:59,300 --> 01:40:02,870
you live 64 percent of your body weight,
whereas with a knee pushup,

1767
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:05,050
your pushup.
So a regular pushup,

1768
01:40:05,060 --> 01:40:09,590
64 percent of your body weight.
So for me it's a little over 100 was

1769
01:40:09,710 --> 01:40:11,540
110,
something like that?

1770
01:40:12,290 --> 01:40:14,600
Yeah.
One 14,

1771
01:40:15,350 --> 01:40:16,490
right?
Sixty four.

1772
01:40:17,420 --> 01:40:18,790
Is that right?
One,

1773
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:19,730
28.
Okay.

1774
01:40:19,731 --> 01:40:22,030
So I was pretty close.
Sixty four posole.

1775
01:40:22,040 --> 01:40:24,050
I was pretty close.
I was thinking it was like 1:30,

1776
01:40:24,051 --> 01:40:27,130
1:44.
Oh,

1777
01:40:27,140 --> 01:40:29,390
that makes sense.
So yeah,

1778
01:40:29,391 --> 01:40:31,970
so that's what I thought.
I can't do 80 pushups.

1779
01:40:32,030 --> 01:40:35,570
I can't do any pushups.
Is breathing was I don't think I can.

1780
01:40:36,040 --> 01:40:40,400
I don't do pushups on much bench press,
heavier weights and I do a lot of their

1781
01:40:40,401 --> 01:40:43,190
stuff while scaring me without
breathing.

1782
01:40:45,970 --> 01:40:47,030
BreAthing.
So powerful.

1783
01:40:49,430 --> 01:40:50,750
I can't we do that.
What are you doIng now?

1784
01:40:52,160 --> 01:40:52,993
Oh,
that's it.

1785
01:40:53,090 --> 01:40:58,090
It's a nose.
The what's the world record pushups.

1786
01:41:00,310 --> 01:41:01,750
How many things the world record in a
row?

1787
01:41:02,200 --> 01:41:07,200
I bet it's like $300 for without leaving
the pushup position in 1987.

1788
01:41:08,471 --> 01:41:10,840
We did a 3000.
Seventy two times for women.

1789
01:41:10,841 --> 01:41:14,320
It's 300 to
3000.

1790
01:41:14,360 --> 01:41:16,000
You can.
You can stay there all day.

1791
01:41:16,001 --> 01:41:17,500
They get to.
There's no time limit on that.

1792
01:41:17,800 --> 01:41:20,200
Oh.
So you can go down and rest and then

1793
01:41:20,201 --> 01:41:21,540
push yourself back up.
Stuff up.

1794
01:41:21,670 --> 01:41:24,970
Probably even for like an hour if you
want it to jesus christ.

1795
01:41:25,300 --> 01:41:28,700
What about in a row?
What about consecutive no arrest record?

1796
01:41:28,701 --> 01:41:32,500
Second an hour.
Is there a consecutive most pushups?

1797
01:41:32,501 --> 01:41:34,340
Nonstop is 10,000.
500.

1798
01:41:37,690 --> 01:41:41,110
Some revelation going on.
Oh my god.

1799
01:41:41,111 --> 01:41:43,990
what kind of a fucking freaked as 10,000
pushups.

1800
01:41:45,920 --> 01:41:46,990
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1801
01:41:46,991 --> 01:41:48,940
Look at what they're defining as
pushups.

1802
01:41:49,350 --> 01:41:51,880
Oh,
that's like a look at their pushups.

1803
01:41:51,970 --> 01:41:53,740
They don't go all the way down those
fucks.

1804
01:41:54,200 --> 01:41:55,270
Now,
if this is what the

1805
01:41:56,860 --> 01:42:01,860
counting.
Hey you gotta touch your chin.

1806
01:42:06,550 --> 01:42:09,790
The world record.
So it's defined though.

1807
01:42:09,791 --> 01:42:13,930
It's defined by a specific degree of
bend in your arms.

1808
01:42:13,990 --> 01:42:17,740
What counts is a pushup is it's
essentially when your arm,

1809
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:21,940
your upper arm is 90 degrees.
It's when your upper arm is parallel to

1810
01:42:21,941 --> 01:42:22,774
the ground.
Yeah,

1811
01:42:22,940 --> 01:42:24,540
right.
Yeah.

1812
01:42:24,970 --> 01:42:27,490
And your lower arms straight up.
And now.

1813
01:42:28,110 --> 01:42:30,790
Huh?
Thirty $800 an hour at 3:38.

1814
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:32,730
Seventy seven.
Jesus christ.

1815
01:42:32,750 --> 01:42:36,370
That's crazy.
That guy probably couldn't even tie his

1816
01:42:36,700 --> 01:42:39,640
shoes the next day.
Probably tore himself apart.

1817
01:42:40,840 --> 01:42:41,980
We went to,
uh,

1818
01:42:42,940 --> 01:42:46,690
we should get wim hoff together with
louie simmons about that.

1819
01:42:47,890 --> 01:42:51,490
Do you know Louis Simmons and simmons is
a madman.

1820
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:54,790
He's the guy.
He's a very famous power lifter.

1821
01:42:55,390 --> 01:42:58,930
And every single part of his body has
been broken.

1822
01:42:59,080 --> 01:43:02,080
He's in his sixties and he's been on
steroids.

1823
01:43:02,081 --> 01:43:06,370
It's 1970.
There's louie simmons has no biceps.

1824
01:43:06,430 --> 01:43:09,340
I think in this picture you probably
still had biceps.

1825
01:43:09,370 --> 01:43:13,720
It seems like there's still there.
His biceps have torn off of the,

1826
01:43:13,960 --> 01:43:17,890
off of the bone.
If he lifts his arms over his head,

1827
01:43:17,891 --> 01:43:22,420
he blacks out because he's so damaged.
She has so much neck and,

1828
01:43:22,421 --> 01:43:27,100
and tissue damage is a fucking maniac.
What a character he is though.

1829
01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:27,931
We,
uh,

1830
01:43:27,931 --> 01:43:30,160
we interviewed him last month.
We went to his gym.

1831
01:43:30,161 --> 01:43:31,840
He's a really,
really famous powerlifter.

1832
01:43:32,020 --> 01:43:35,980
He's actually a genius when it comes to
the construction of exercise equipment.

1833
01:43:36,130 --> 01:43:38,260
We have one of his pieces of equipment
in the back.

1834
01:43:38,261 --> 01:43:39,460
It's called the reverse hyper.

1835
01:43:39,610 --> 01:43:42,130
That damn thing changed my life.
I'll show it to you afterwards.

1836
01:43:42,370 --> 01:43:43,091
You could see it,
it,

1837
01:43:43,091 --> 01:43:46,590
it actively decompresses the spine.
Say that's a,

1838
01:43:46,600 --> 01:43:50,620
the lifting up,
but on the lifting down it goes under

1839
01:43:50,621 --> 01:43:52,670
the weight,
goes underneath that bench and it

1840
01:43:52,671 --> 01:43:57,620
actually pulls apart your spine.
It decompresses the spine.

1841
01:43:57,621 --> 01:44:02,180
So all of the gravity and the stress and
all the different measures they could

1842
01:44:02,181 --> 01:44:04,460
see how it works.
So it's an amazing piece of equipment.

1843
01:44:04,490 --> 01:44:05,311
And he,
louis,

1844
01:44:05,311 --> 01:44:06,200
uh,
invented that.

1845
01:44:06,201 --> 01:44:09,380
He's got some great,
great ideas about power lifting,

1846
01:44:09,381 --> 01:44:11,810
but he's just like many brilliant
people.

1847
01:44:11,811 --> 01:44:15,440
He's fucking insane.
It's a great way and a great way.

1848
01:44:16,280 --> 01:44:17,690
But anyway,
you,

1849
01:44:17,700 --> 01:44:19,100
you and him together.
Maybe you could fix them,

1850
01:44:20,150 --> 01:44:22,180
get them breathing.
He wouldn't let me just start swearing,

1851
01:44:22,610 --> 01:44:24,230
throwing shit around,
do some steroids.

1852
01:44:27,780 --> 01:44:29,320
Great.
So

1853
01:44:34,480 --> 01:44:37,770
yeah,
I had a lot more facts going on,

1854
01:44:38,040 --> 01:44:43,040
really are progressing with the science
and becoming more famous and we are

1855
01:44:43,831 --> 01:44:47,730
reaching out more and more.
A very powerful people.

1856
01:44:47,731 --> 01:44:52,731
Famous people are beginning to get the
idea and they will help me in the

1857
01:44:54,090 --> 01:44:57,540
Indiana.
I want to do charity because I did

1858
01:44:57,541 --> 01:44:59,910
already the breakthroughs within the
science.

1859
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:01,930
Uh,
and uh,

1860
01:45:02,070 --> 01:45:04,980
now I want to do charity.
Yes.

1861
01:45:05,220 --> 01:45:09,060
That like we were talking about Tanzania
and uh,

1862
01:45:09,070 --> 01:45:14,070
and the resource and the messiah and the
messiah before they were the men who are

1863
01:45:14,551 --> 01:45:18,930
able to stand off a line.
So they are dealing with fear.

1864
01:45:19,650 --> 01:45:24,650
They become a lion is able to smell fear
and uh,

1865
01:45:25,950 --> 01:45:29,790
animals like a,
that's reactive.

1866
01:45:29,880 --> 01:45:31,810
It's a,
it's our hormones,

1867
01:45:31,830 --> 01:45:36,780
but people have it as well.
And so that's why we go in cars through

1868
01:45:36,781 --> 01:45:41,781
these reserves,
etc. Now I found that that fear is

1869
01:45:43,771 --> 01:45:48,771
actually coming in within our
subconscious fear because we are not

1870
01:45:49,690 --> 01:45:51,210
acting natural anymore.

1871
01:45:51,450 --> 01:45:55,020
Uh,
we alienated from nature and we have

1872
01:45:55,021 --> 01:45:57,390
fear.
We are able to walk in a city with an

1873
01:45:57,391 --> 01:45:58,490
attitude,
et cetera.

1874
01:45:58,710 --> 01:46:03,090
But do it now in front of the line.
Then you become fearful because you know

1875
01:46:03,240 --> 01:46:08,190
you are not able to cope with that
situation and you have to be peaceful.

1876
01:46:08,191 --> 01:46:11,880
You have to be there,
but you then the line will not attack

1877
01:46:11,881 --> 01:46:15,360
you.
It only attacks when it's hungry and you

1878
01:46:15,361 --> 01:46:17,820
can see things and all,
all those things.

1879
01:46:18,330 --> 01:46:22,680
But if you have no fear,
you could just pass by a couple of

1880
01:46:22,680 --> 01:46:25,980
meters from alliance in the world.
What I'm,

1881
01:46:26,070 --> 01:46:27,570
yes.
And this is what I'm,

1882
01:46:27,660 --> 01:46:29,050
who knows this,
uh,

1883
01:46:29,320 --> 01:46:31,320
me and the maasai.
Have you done it?

1884
01:46:31,730 --> 01:46:32,570
But I,
I'm,

1885
01:46:32,610 --> 01:46:34,260
I'm with a massage.
Do it.

1886
01:46:34,530 --> 01:46:36,670
I'm with the maasai.
And uh,

1887
01:46:36,720 --> 01:46:37,553
they,
uh,

1888
01:46:37,750 --> 01:46:41,670
I'm doing this.
It's called garden garden of eden

1889
01:46:41,970 --> 01:46:45,630
project.
That means with really wild animals like

1890
01:46:45,810 --> 01:46:47,460
hyenas,
elephants,

1891
01:46:47,700 --> 01:46:49,230
giraffes,
lions.

1892
01:46:49,320 --> 01:46:50,040
I want to show you

1893
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:52,650
a picture before you engage in this
ridiculous adventure.

1894
01:46:52,860 --> 01:46:57,150
It was a photo of.
There's a photographer that climbed out

1895
01:46:57,151 --> 01:46:58,560
of his jeep.
Do you see that photo?

1896
01:46:58,570 --> 01:47:02,710
Remember it was in the daily mail where
there's a series of photographs were a

1897
01:47:02,720 --> 01:47:07,030
lion was going to pounce on him.
It literally jumped towards him and

1898
01:47:07,080 --> 01:47:09,450
opened its mouth and this guy got
photos.

1899
01:47:09,870 --> 01:47:14,370
I think it was inside of like 30 or 40
feet when the lion finally stopped,

1900
01:47:14,371 --> 01:47:16,950
but they are some of the most terrifying
photos.

1901
01:47:17,970 --> 01:47:22,970
Photographer gets shots of lion before
when it almost attacked him.

1902
01:47:23,850 --> 01:47:25,830
See if he could find it.
I have them on my phone.

1903
01:47:25,831 --> 01:47:27,060
I can show it to you.
Interesting.

1904
01:47:27,090 --> 01:47:28,920
It was my screensaver on my phone
forever.

1905
01:47:30,390 --> 01:47:33,960
But you see a situation,
another situation,

1906
01:47:33,961 --> 01:47:38,961
a people go windows jeep through the
safari and see lions.

1907
01:47:39,610 --> 01:47:44,610
So about 12 of them lying there and you
go with a jeep.

1908
01:47:45,810 --> 01:47:50,290
Then suddenly comes to my kid on his
bike and older lights.

1909
01:47:50,291 --> 01:47:54,150
He him and there is to look at that
face.

1910
01:47:54,270 --> 01:47:56,440
Oh yeah.
Fuck that.

1911
01:47:56,550 --> 01:47:57,960
Whoa.
That thing.

1912
01:48:00,490 --> 01:48:03,450
It's way scarier than a werewolf.
You know why?

1913
01:48:04,140 --> 01:48:07,080
Because a lion is a lion every fucking
day of the week,

1914
01:48:07,140 --> 01:48:09,600
365 days a year,
as long as it's alive.

1915
01:48:09,870 --> 01:48:12,570
A werewolf the werewolf,
one day a month,

1916
01:48:13,910 --> 01:48:15,800
full moon.
That's a goddamn lie.

1917
01:48:15,801 --> 01:48:18,960
And fuck a werewolf.
It's kind of funny because that's way

1918
01:48:18,961 --> 01:48:21,540
scarier than a werewolf.
It's way bigger than a werewolf.

1919
01:48:21,630 --> 01:48:23,790
Interesting.
Look at the face on that thing.

1920
01:48:24,540 --> 01:48:27,270
Nature.
Nature is amazing.

1921
01:48:27,630 --> 01:48:32,630
Like that is an amazing creation.
Interest and amazing creature are able

1922
01:48:34,441 --> 01:48:37,530
to stand up.
I believe it when I see it.

1923
01:48:37,890 --> 01:48:40,170
Yes.
But the thing is,

1924
01:48:40,470 --> 01:48:45,470
what do you.
I want to create an agency within my

1925
01:48:48,971 --> 01:48:53,971
salary together and then have people
walk through it instead off a car under

1926
01:48:57,300 --> 01:49:02,300
guidance of under guidance of my site
under guidance of navy seals arm to the

1927
01:49:04,130 --> 01:49:07,110
tetes fucking missile launchers and
shit.

1928
01:49:07,260 --> 01:49:07,801
Yeah.
Yeah.

1929
01:49:07,801 --> 01:49:09,510
You think so that,
that helps.

1930
01:49:09,511 --> 01:49:12,240
But it is something definitely helps.
That's the only way I'm going.

1931
01:49:12,870 --> 01:49:13,703
Oh,
okay.

1932
01:49:14,580 --> 01:49:18,390
More and more important.
More.

1933
01:49:19,620 --> 01:49:20,120
Oh,
right.

1934
01:49:20,120 --> 01:49:21,300
Okay.
I like it.

1935
01:49:21,640 --> 01:49:25,740
A far more important to this to help the
homeless.

1936
01:49:25,800 --> 01:49:27,960
Yes.
And that's where I going to help them,

1937
01:49:28,230 --> 01:49:29,930
uh,
you know,

1938
01:49:29,940 --> 01:49:34,860
ptsd and all that.
We Are into university studies right now

1939
01:49:35,560 --> 01:49:38,310
dealing with that and about the
homeless,

1940
01:49:38,780 --> 01:49:40,980
homeless veterans,
like tony robbins,

1941
01:49:41,480 --> 01:49:44,340
it,
providing for like hundred million

1942
01:49:44,340 --> 01:49:46,290
meals.
I'm going to help wherever I can.

1943
01:49:46,320 --> 01:49:51,320
Of course I want to do more like there
are these soup kitchens and they,

1944
01:49:55,120 --> 01:50:00,120
they do don't ask money for your
participation and have say a meal,

1945
01:50:02,050 --> 01:50:05,320
but you can donate.
So people who are homeless,

1946
01:50:05,500 --> 01:50:06,640
they have no money,
right?

1947
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:11,880
So they are able to eat and those who
come there and have altered meat meal,

1948
01:50:12,880 --> 01:50:17,880
they are not obliged to give money but
they gave it anyway and they see the

1949
01:50:18,971 --> 01:50:20,200
idea behind it,
the,

1950
01:50:20,470 --> 01:50:22,150
the charity go behind it.

1951
01:50:22,810 --> 01:50:27,810
And most of the times they give okay
money and it survives.

1952
01:50:28,311 --> 01:50:31,420
It's okay,
it works now I want these homeless

1953
01:50:31,421 --> 01:50:35,020
people and not only to have a soup
kitchen like that,

1954
01:50:35,500 --> 01:50:40,500
but also work on the land and providing
vegetables and all that for the

1955
01:50:42,401 --> 01:50:46,120
restaurant and this tribute as well in
the city.

1956
01:50:46,870 --> 01:50:51,190
I think this way we could.
It's very making them active,

1957
01:50:51,220 --> 01:50:56,020
not just donating and giving food,
but to get them back into,

1958
01:50:56,490 --> 01:50:58,180
uh,
the infrastructure,

1959
01:50:58,181 --> 01:51:01,540
the system,
the civilization among people.

1960
01:51:01,660 --> 01:51:02,860
Right.
That's it.

1961
01:51:02,950 --> 01:51:05,020
Well,
if you could just get them active and

1962
01:51:05,021 --> 01:51:06,670
give them some hope.
Right.

1963
01:51:06,671 --> 01:51:08,710
There's a lot of people that just,
almost.

1964
01:51:08,770 --> 01:51:13,420
I think there's,
there's levels of poverty and despair

1965
01:51:13,570 --> 01:51:17,050
and I think for some people that just
like on the edge and maybe just a little

1966
01:51:17,051 --> 01:51:20,020
bit of help or bring them back off the
edge and bring them back into

1967
01:51:20,021 --> 01:51:20,854
circulation.

1968
01:51:20,890 --> 01:51:21,723
You know,
I mean,

1969
01:51:21,910 --> 01:51:22,600
yeah,
yeah.

1970
01:51:22,600 --> 01:51:26,380
Many people become homeless over time
and they weren't before and then it

1971
01:51:26,381 --> 01:51:29,140
just,
things don't go well and I know a bunch

1972
01:51:29,141 --> 01:51:31,030
of,
have a bunch of comedian friends that

1973
01:51:31,031 --> 01:51:34,540
lived in their cars and you know,
living on people's couches and we're

1974
01:51:34,690 --> 01:51:37,270
real close to homeless but made it
through.

1975
01:51:37,690 --> 01:51:40,390
So it's even.
There's very various levels,

1976
01:51:40,470 --> 01:51:44,050
strange thing that a thing called
civilization and yes,

1977
01:51:44,051 --> 01:51:46,390
I mean homeless is a very strange thing,
right?

1978
01:51:46,630 --> 01:51:48,790
Like you don't have a regular place to
go.

1979
01:51:49,030 --> 01:51:52,210
And that in our mind is like one of the
saddest things.

1980
01:51:52,600 --> 01:51:53,650
Like,
oh,

1981
01:51:53,651 --> 01:51:55,890
you don't have a place for your shit.
Yeah.

1982
01:51:57,030 --> 01:51:58,330
What do you,
how do you watch tv,

1983
01:51:59,080 --> 01:52:01,810
get online,
do you don't even have a facebook.

1984
01:52:02,090 --> 01:52:05,560
You're homeless and you know,
and that's how a lot of us look at it.

1985
01:52:05,590 --> 01:52:07,240
We look at someone not having home.

1986
01:52:07,390 --> 01:52:11,680
Meanwhile the homeless person or this
person who's like a backpack or some,

1987
01:52:11,830 --> 01:52:13,930
you know,
person who's like a traveler,

1988
01:52:14,380 --> 01:52:18,820
they might be way happier and healthier
than a lot of people that you see

1989
01:52:18,821 --> 01:52:21,370
trapped in these homes that are sitting
there smoking cigarettes.

1990
01:52:21,880 --> 01:52:24,880
Absolutely.
Caring and sharing.

1991
01:52:24,980 --> 01:52:27,100
Yeah.
That is the thing missing.

1992
01:52:28,070 --> 01:52:30,250
It certainly helped a lot of people,
right?

1993
01:52:30,460 --> 01:52:31,870
Yeah.
And uh,

1994
01:52:31,900 --> 01:52:33,960
how to get to that.
Yeah.

1995
01:52:33,970 --> 01:52:37,990
And it's abstract now,
but I'm getting it through science.

1996
01:52:37,991 --> 01:52:40,240
But uh,
I did the science now.

1997
01:52:40,990 --> 01:52:43,760
I wanted to do charity.
That's great thing.

1998
01:52:44,040 --> 01:52:44,970
That is great.
Yeah.

1999
01:52:45,490 --> 01:52:46,220
And you helping

2000
01:52:46,220 --> 01:52:49,430
me right now,
I'm happy to be helping you do anything

2001
01:52:49,431 --> 01:52:53,840
is maybe a little bit of our society is
so competitive and that that competitive

2002
01:52:53,841 --> 01:52:57,320
nature sort of alienates us from the
other people around us.

2003
01:52:57,321 --> 01:53:01,160
We think of them as competitors rather
than think of them as our brothers and

2004
01:53:01,161 --> 01:53:02,590
sisters.
I think there's,

2005
01:53:03,230 --> 01:53:06,890
there's a,
there's a lack of clarity when it comes

2006
01:53:06,891 --> 01:53:09,200
to the,
the actual real amount of time that we

2007
01:53:09,201 --> 01:53:11,360
have here.
We don't really have that much time.

2008
01:53:11,620 --> 01:53:15,020
It seems like a lot of time,
but I'm 49.

2009
01:53:15,080 --> 01:53:17,330
How old are you?
Fifty seven.

2010
01:53:17,450 --> 01:53:18,231
Yeah.
It goes quick,

2011
01:53:18,231 --> 01:53:19,920
right?
All of a sudden it's,

2012
01:53:20,210 --> 01:53:22,130
you know,
I'm still gonna.

2013
01:53:22,160 --> 01:53:27,160
Go do fucking man.
Not saying you're not going to go fast.

2014
01:53:28,610 --> 01:53:32,030
IT's going fast,
but we broke through and what you did is

2015
01:53:32,031 --> 01:53:34,830
also very memorable bro,
bro.

2016
01:53:35,390 --> 01:53:38,330
It's good.
We got to bring more consciousness and

2017
01:53:38,331 --> 01:53:39,050
we,
we got,

2018
01:53:39,050 --> 01:53:41,330
we.
If we are really strong,

2019
01:53:41,660 --> 01:53:46,630
we protect the weak and adults who are
not able to honor a,

2020
01:53:46,740 --> 01:53:48,110
you know,
we give love,

2021
01:53:48,620 --> 01:53:51,740
we do it in our way.
You do it with,

2022
01:53:51,741 --> 01:53:55,820
by creating our awareness and by signs
and,

2023
01:53:55,900 --> 01:54:00,900
and try to do now charity and we got a
hat it on w one way or another through

2024
01:54:02,271 --> 01:54:04,160
inspiration.
I think that's another thing you're

2025
01:54:04,161 --> 01:54:06,980
doing.
You're inspiring people to do something

2026
01:54:06,981 --> 01:54:10,880
and take positive action and that
oftentimes is the best thing you could

2027
01:54:10,881 --> 01:54:14,030
do rather than to help them or to give
them help.

2028
01:54:14,320 --> 01:54:17,300
You are providing them with their own
self help.

2029
01:54:17,630 --> 01:54:21,640
What I,
I just came from san francisco now or to

2030
01:54:21,690 --> 01:54:23,210
meet you here I think,
uh,

2031
01:54:23,480 --> 01:54:27,440
once again,
ana create me to feel feelings mutual.

2032
01:54:27,890 --> 01:54:29,550
Thanks very much.
I,

2033
01:54:29,640 --> 01:54:32,810
I saw homeless people over there,
but you know,

2034
01:54:33,020 --> 01:54:37,920
big guys and look at good at

2035
01:54:38,640 --> 01:54:40,980
a certain moment.
I think san francisco.

2036
01:54:41,010 --> 01:54:45,930
Why don't you do something about this?
San francisco is infested with

2037
01:54:46,290 --> 01:54:48,900
acceptance.
They have too much acceptance.

2038
01:54:48,901 --> 01:54:53,640
They've gone so far over the edge that
they've made it easy for people to,

2039
01:54:53,730 --> 01:54:55,860
you know,
just kind of fuck off and hang out on

2040
01:54:55,861 --> 01:54:59,190
the street.
And then there's also the very real

2041
01:54:59,191 --> 01:55:03,240
problem of mental illness and a homeless
veterans.

2042
01:55:03,270 --> 01:55:04,260
People,
as you said before,

2043
01:55:04,261 --> 01:55:08,280
that a ptsd.
So there's a wide spectrum of reasons

2044
01:55:09,130 --> 01:55:12,300
why people become homeless,
but san francisco is very accepting of

2045
01:55:12,301 --> 01:55:13,860
it.
It's the most accepting city I've ever

2046
01:55:13,861 --> 01:55:15,690
been to when it comes to homeless
people.

2047
01:55:15,900 --> 01:55:18,330
But it's also one of the reasons why san
francisco is so great,

2048
01:55:18,640 --> 01:55:21,240
like they're so open minded.
I lived there when I was a kid.

2049
01:55:21,540 --> 01:55:25,230
I lived in san francisco from age seven
to 11 and it was a different san

2050
01:55:25,231 --> 01:55:30,231
francisco because san francisco now is
all tech giants and in billionaires in

2051
01:55:31,230 --> 01:55:32,010
silicon valley.

2052
01:55:32,010 --> 01:55:34,290
I,
I did things over there down.

2053
01:55:34,410 --> 01:55:36,450
Oh my god.
Real estate prices are insane.

2054
01:55:37,680 --> 01:55:40,320
One of the most insane places in the
world when it comes to real estate

2055
01:55:40,321 --> 01:55:42,250
prices.
When I was a kid it was,

2056
01:55:42,350 --> 01:55:46,860
it was hippies because when I was there
it was during the Vietnam war and my

2057
01:55:46,861 --> 01:55:49,950
stepdad was a hippie.
My mom was kind of a hippie and we lived

2058
01:55:49,951 --> 01:55:51,720
in a hippie neighborhood.
It was just hippies.

2059
01:55:51,750 --> 01:55:53,160
It was just,
it was weird.

2060
01:55:53,161 --> 01:55:58,161
It was like it was all gay and hippies
and it's not really like that.

2061
01:55:58,480 --> 01:56:00,800
Even the gay people,
like they're kind of getting pushed out

2062
01:56:00,801 --> 01:56:03,120
in san francisco has always kind of
synonymous with gay people.

2063
01:56:03,121 --> 01:56:06,210
It's not.
I mean it's more tech now than anything

2064
01:56:06,211 --> 01:56:11,211
else and just extraordinary wealth,
but they still are very open minded.

2065
01:56:12,211 --> 01:56:14,400
Very progressive.
It's very left wing,

2066
01:56:14,820 --> 01:56:18,750
sort of liberal kind of a town which has
its pluses and minuses,

2067
01:56:19,230 --> 01:56:20,760
you know,
it's just,

2068
01:56:21,370 --> 01:56:22,890
you know,
the tolerance is excellent.

2069
01:56:22,890 --> 01:56:24,910
It's really good.
but some,

2070
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:26,970
I mean when you have that many homeless
people,

2071
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,850
like something's not right.
What is that thing?

2072
01:56:29,910 --> 01:56:33,780
I mean I would be,
it would be very arrogant of me without

2073
01:56:33,781 --> 01:56:37,260
any work or investigation whatsoever to
try to give some sort of an explanation

2074
01:56:37,261 --> 01:56:41,110
for what it is.
But a lot of it's got to be connected to

2075
01:56:41,111 --> 01:56:43,680
how liberal they are.
They just so they're so open minded.

2076
01:56:43,681 --> 01:56:48,660
they're just accepting.
I think it is old ho problem throughout

2077
01:56:48,661 --> 01:56:50,230
America,
eh,

2078
01:56:50,290 --> 01:56:53,170
you know,
the difference between the real rich and

2079
01:56:53,180 --> 01:56:54,420
uh,
in the pool.

2080
01:56:54,810 --> 01:56:58,080
And uh,
but they did in baltimore for example,

2081
01:56:58,081 --> 01:57:03,081
I saw a documentary lately lately about
the shame of America and they told it

2082
01:57:04,381 --> 01:57:09,110
into documentary and things like that.
And now they do these programs with

2083
01:57:09,120 --> 01:57:13,830
meditation and breathing in this cooled
and they more yes,

2084
01:57:13,831 --> 01:57:18,831
in baltimore and they got a lot of
success that their mental state,

2085
01:57:19,471 --> 01:57:24,471
their psych is a lot better now at just
because of minding.

2086
01:57:25,470 --> 01:57:29,210
And that's what we need to get to school
in schooling.

2087
01:57:29,400 --> 01:57:31,350
Breathing mindfulness.
Yeah.

2088
01:57:31,351 --> 01:57:33,120
No,
there'll be an amazing thing for kids

2089
01:57:33,230 --> 01:57:35,490
that the people,
baltimore elementary school,

2090
01:57:35,670 --> 01:57:39,460
nixon's is detention for mindful
meditation that hey,

2091
01:57:39,530 --> 01:57:43,760
you got some amazing and children are
very able to do that.

2092
01:57:43,890 --> 01:57:45,330
Change lives.
Oh yes.

2093
01:57:45,331 --> 01:57:47,950
That can truly truly changes lives
because you,

2094
01:57:47,990 --> 01:57:52,140
you can give a child instead of this
horrible thing where they feel terrible

2095
01:57:52,141 --> 01:57:54,030
about themselves.
You give them a reset.

2096
01:57:54,990 --> 01:57:56,130
Absolutely.
That's awesome.

2097
01:57:56,430 --> 01:58:01,430
The more out of the box thinking because
the standard thInking of raising kids.

2098
01:58:01,561 --> 01:58:05,340
I mean I don't know what schools like in
holland where you're from,

2099
01:58:05,370 --> 01:58:07,740
but here in America where I went to
school,

2100
01:58:09,060 --> 01:58:12,330
it was terribly confining.
Like you had to think a certain way.

2101
01:58:12,331 --> 01:58:14,440
You hAve to study certain things.
Yeah.

2102
01:58:14,520 --> 01:58:16,830
You weren't interested in those things.
you,

2103
01:58:17,160 --> 01:58:18,780
they made you feel like a loser.

2104
01:58:18,830 --> 01:58:20,850
Yeah.
If you weren't interested in math,

2105
01:58:20,851 --> 01:58:24,210
it was boring to you to sTudy certain
things they made you feel liKe you were

2106
01:58:24,211 --> 01:58:26,800
a fool and you have studies that days.
Yeah,

2107
01:58:27,040 --> 01:58:28,740
no,
the real,

2108
01:58:29,280 --> 01:58:32,360
most important assets of life and
happiness strengthen,

2109
01:58:32,740 --> 01:58:33,990
uh,
and uh,

2110
01:58:34,370 --> 01:58:35,500
and uh,
uh,

2111
01:58:35,640 --> 01:58:38,970
health will also be subjects into
school.

2112
01:58:38,971 --> 01:58:39,900
Boom,
bang,

2113
01:58:40,110 --> 01:58:44,620
and then that's creativity,
but embracing creativity as an option

2114
01:58:44,621 --> 01:58:48,510
for you doing something with your life.
No one ever tells you that you could,

2115
01:58:48,540 --> 01:58:52,120
you could be creative for a living,
that you could be a sculptor or a

2116
01:58:52,121 --> 01:58:57,121
painter or an artist or a musician or an
a standup comedian or an author that's

2117
01:58:57,461 --> 01:59:01,450
never offered up
to get a job,

2118
01:59:01,860 --> 01:59:05,080
work for somebody else or start your own
business and hire some people.

2119
01:59:05,120 --> 01:59:07,690
That is,
it's like if you look at the,

2120
01:59:07,720 --> 01:59:12,520
the standard places that people go once
they graduate from high school or

2121
01:59:12,521 --> 01:59:14,410
college,
it's usually to get a job.

2122
01:59:14,410 --> 01:59:16,060
So they push you in that direction.
Like this.

2123
01:59:16,300 --> 01:59:17,890
There's no individual attention.
You not,

2124
01:59:17,950 --> 01:59:20,860
you don't feel unique.
You don't feel special.

2125
01:59:20,861 --> 01:59:24,430
You don't feel like you have a chance of
making outside of the system.

2126
01:59:24,580 --> 01:59:27,130
You have to fit into the system that
they're presenting to you.

2127
01:59:27,160 --> 01:59:29,860
These are your college courses,
this is your college options.

2128
01:59:29,861 --> 01:59:33,070
You know your gpa is not so good,
so you're going to have to go here and

2129
01:59:33,071 --> 01:59:35,890
that's going to suck because then your
job options going to be limited or you

2130
01:59:35,891 --> 01:59:37,840
can go to community college and try to
bring it up and you're like,

2131
01:59:37,870 --> 01:59:40,330
oh my god,
all this fucking work,

2132
01:59:40,331 --> 01:59:43,750
and then I'm going to take a job that's
going to suck and it's just soul sucking

2133
01:59:44,040 --> 01:59:45,610
for me.
I mean for some people,

2134
01:59:45,611 --> 01:59:47,500
those options seemed like a wonderful
idea.

2135
01:59:47,570 --> 01:59:51,190
Yeah.
They don't offer you a lot of choices.

2136
01:59:51,300 --> 01:59:55,360
There's not.
There's not like the creative fields are

2137
01:59:55,361 --> 01:59:58,330
not embraced and I think that's a real
problem because many,

2138
01:59:58,331 --> 01:59:58,811
many,
many,

2139
01:59:58,811 --> 02:00:00,680
many kids.
I have little tivity yes.

2140
02:00:00,740 --> 02:00:05,600
The means to express the soul's purpose
will they know when there's only seven

2141
02:00:05,630 --> 02:00:09,380
percent in the world population that is
being creative.

2142
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:15,000
It was that real ad arrest has enthuses
system being almost,

2143
02:00:16,491 --> 02:00:18,840
you know,
percent of little children and creating

2144
02:00:18,910 --> 02:00:23,450
automizing the soul.
It's not letting the soul express

2145
02:00:23,451 --> 02:00:25,130
itself.
I mean soul.

2146
02:00:25,160 --> 02:00:30,160
Nobody knows what it is,
but creativity expressing your being

2147
02:00:30,870 --> 02:00:31,600
that,
that,

2148
02:00:31,600 --> 02:00:34,730
that makes it will tow beautiful
actually,

2149
02:00:34,760 --> 02:00:39,760
and now it's becoming like a gray area
feeding a system and nobody knows how to

2150
02:00:42,231 --> 02:00:46,850
stop this.
So what this system needs to turn around

2151
02:00:46,910 --> 02:00:50,570
and begin to look,
how can we serve your happiness,

2152
02:00:50,571 --> 02:00:53,720
strength and health because strength,
a strength,

2153
02:00:53,750 --> 02:00:58,550
a strong,
healthy and happy people will make up a

2154
02:00:58,551 --> 02:01:02,780
great system.
We have gone too far.

2155
02:01:03,290 --> 02:01:08,090
Now we need to go back into self
awareness and we are proving.

2156
02:01:08,091 --> 02:01:12,790
This is simply that we are able to do so
much more direct.

2157
02:01:12,980 --> 02:01:15,020
Well,
I think there's just a lot of momentum

2158
02:01:15,040 --> 02:01:20,040
that's that is attached to our education
system and to our job options.

2159
02:01:21,111 --> 02:01:24,620
Once we graduated from school and this
momentum is very difficult to someone to

2160
02:01:24,621 --> 02:01:28,460
step away from because most of the time,
by the time someone graduates from

2161
02:01:28,461 --> 02:01:29,870
college,
early in debt,

2162
02:01:30,250 --> 02:01:33,730
you are in debt from credit cards.
You're in debt from student loans,

2163
02:01:33,731 --> 02:01:34,161
money,
money,

2164
02:01:34,161 --> 02:01:34,620
money,
money,

2165
02:01:34,620 --> 02:01:37,340
you have to make money in order to pay
that debt off,

2166
02:01:37,570 --> 02:01:40,010
and so you immediately go right,
the workforce,

2167
02:01:40,010 --> 02:01:44,300
and then if you're tired after working
all day and most people find it very

2168
02:01:44,301 --> 02:01:46,700
difficult to find a way to break free
and to,

2169
02:01:46,840 --> 02:01:48,860
to pursue their real dreams,
whatever they are,

2170
02:01:48,861 --> 02:01:52,040
you know,
songwriting or it is being an author

2171
02:01:52,150 --> 02:01:53,660
event.
So being wim hoff.

2172
02:01:55,070 --> 02:01:56,600
Yeah.
I had to find my way.

2173
02:01:56,690 --> 02:01:57,980
Yeah.
What did you used to do for a living?

2174
02:01:58,890 --> 02:02:03,890
All kinds of things.
Like I've been a teacher and you teach a

2175
02:02:05,360 --> 02:02:08,000
postman english.
Yoga.

2176
02:02:08,490 --> 02:02:09,700
You taught yoga.
Yeah.

2177
02:02:09,990 --> 02:02:11,000
No kenny.
Oh,

2178
02:02:11,001 --> 02:02:15,230
I know stuff.
You just under a do all kinds of

2179
02:02:15,231 --> 02:02:18,620
exercises,
but I've seen some of the crazy poses

2180
02:02:18,621 --> 02:02:21,440
you can get into them.
Imagine you teach yoga has how,

2181
02:02:22,880 --> 02:02:27,880
say mountaineering a instructor or going
into mom to guide a mountain guiding

2182
02:02:30,920 --> 02:02:35,320
canyoning.
Although studying a postman,

2183
02:02:35,810 --> 02:02:40,810
uh,
working in a harbor harbor ship,

2184
02:02:41,330 --> 02:02:43,440
loading ships,
habash

2185
02:02:45,590 --> 02:02:48,950
many things.
Wherever I go to lay my hands because I

2186
02:02:49,010 --> 02:02:51,050
didn't finish any schooling.

2187
02:02:52,130 --> 02:02:54,920
I'm a self made man.
I speak many languages,

2188
02:02:54,960 --> 02:02:59,960
I buy all,
told them myself and learned a lot about

2189
02:03:00,561 --> 02:03:03,320
philosophy.
Which you speak right now.

2190
02:03:03,321 --> 02:03:05,510
Anglaise.
Besides of my own language.

2191
02:03:05,511 --> 02:03:06,490
Uh,
uh,

2192
02:03:06,530 --> 02:03:08,780
dutch,
but then also french and german and

2193
02:03:08,781 --> 02:03:11,600
polish and spanish and italian.
Wow.

2194
02:03:11,630 --> 02:03:14,510
And even japanese.
And you speak those languages as well as

2195
02:03:14,511 --> 02:03:15,344
you speak?
English?

2196
02:03:16,070 --> 02:03:18,230
No,
because she needs to practice.

2197
02:03:18,640 --> 02:03:21,950
If you do not use it,
you lose it.

2198
02:03:22,150 --> 02:03:25,280
A of a.
It's all in there.

2199
02:03:25,340 --> 02:03:30,340
So your primary is english and dutch or
german?

2200
02:03:31,280 --> 02:03:33,590
Spanish.
Dan french.

2201
02:03:33,620 --> 02:03:35,530
That's amazing.
And you learn these Books.

2202
02:03:35,690 --> 02:03:37,190
Yeah,
the books.

2203
02:03:37,191 --> 02:03:41,030
I'm talking to people just talking.
But what about the gRammar?

2204
02:03:42,080 --> 02:03:44,240
I mean,
I would imagine the difference between

2205
02:03:44,680 --> 02:03:47,840
take out books once you begin to
understand a couple of language or you

2206
02:03:47,841 --> 02:03:48,674
know,
the,

2207
02:03:48,830 --> 02:03:53,420
the logic of the languages and it
becomes easier to take up a language.

2208
02:03:53,530 --> 02:03:57,380
What did you want to do?
What I wanted to do.

2209
02:03:57,440 --> 02:03:59,580
It's like when you were younger right
now.

2210
02:03:59,870 --> 02:04:00,830
Really?
Yes.

2211
02:04:01,340 --> 02:04:03,710
Really looking at 10 years old,
19 years old.

2212
02:04:03,711 --> 02:04:04,940
And you're young man.
Really?

2213
02:04:04,941 --> 02:04:09,941
I wasn't into changing the world.
I was into our so far out and doing

2214
02:04:11,150 --> 02:04:15,710
crazy stuff.
It was like from 17 years on,

2215
02:04:15,740 --> 02:04:20,740
I began to go into the cold,
being inspired by anthropologists,

2216
02:04:22,650 --> 02:04:26,730
went into tibet and talked about the
discipline,

2217
02:04:26,960 --> 02:04:28,170
the buddhist.
Yeah,

2218
02:04:28,171 --> 02:04:31,260
the esoteric disciplines of the
buddhists or buddhism

2219
02:04:32,780 --> 02:04:37,550
they call cities within the yoga and all
sandy.

2220
02:04:37,960 --> 02:04:38,160
Oh,

2221
02:04:38,160 --> 02:04:42,310
cities like cities of levitation,
that's an old oh,

2222
02:04:42,320 --> 02:04:47,320
staying and Japan and there's some right
in moodle and all that.

2223
02:04:48,810 --> 02:04:50,970
I was very,
very intrigued.

2224
02:04:51,270 --> 02:04:56,010
Why?
Because I think they found a way to show

2225
02:04:56,011 --> 02:05:01,011
that the depth is existent,
but it takes years and you got to go

2226
02:05:02,551 --> 02:05:04,390
like a caveman in,
uh,

2227
02:05:04,430 --> 02:05:05,540
and uh,
and uh,

2228
02:05:05,600 --> 02:05:10,600
and isolate a guru or adapt,
introduce yoga practices and it's old,

2229
02:05:14,600 --> 02:05:17,700
very secretive and uh,
and things like that.

2230
02:05:17,701 --> 02:05:20,940
And uh,
I was looking at internet and,

2231
02:05:21,600 --> 02:05:25,320
and why?
I think it has got something to do with

2232
02:05:25,321 --> 02:05:27,120
my birth.
It was traumatic.

2233
02:05:27,330 --> 02:05:32,330
It was one of the identical twin and I
was born quite too late.

2234
02:05:33,600 --> 02:05:38,040
Not really too late,
but it made a real psychic imprint when

2235
02:05:38,041 --> 02:05:42,210
I came without too much of oxygen.
Oh,

2236
02:05:43,470 --> 02:05:45,780
fear and trauma.
And yes,

2237
02:05:45,781 --> 02:05:47,130
and uh,
and uh,

2238
02:05:47,131 --> 02:05:50,710
and too cold in a,
in a place and I was born,

2239
02:05:50,730 --> 02:05:51,660
delivered over there.

2240
02:05:52,080 --> 02:05:57,080
So I think that made a psychic imprint
which had a absolute influence in my

2241
02:05:58,861 --> 02:06:00,210
growing.
Uh,

2242
02:06:00,211 --> 02:06:05,211
and then later what's happening,
I always wear it had been looking into

2243
02:06:05,341 --> 02:06:06,690
psychology,
different,

2244
02:06:06,691 --> 02:06:08,660
uh,
disciplines say religious,

2245
02:06:08,690 --> 02:06:13,020
etc. Are always more interested tHan my
identical twin brother.

2246
02:06:13,350 --> 02:06:17,730
He's actually a normal guy working like
nine to five.

2247
02:06:18,150 --> 02:06:22,290
Like everybody could get him to play you
in some places where you can't get

2248
02:06:22,291 --> 02:06:25,440
there.
We're going to grow his hair like,

2249
02:06:25,441 --> 02:06:26,920
you know.
No,

2250
02:06:26,960 --> 02:06:29,590
not that I meet in the middle.
It's a.

2251
02:06:29,710 --> 02:06:31,160
Yeah,
we did,

2252
02:06:31,480 --> 02:06:34,860
we did tricks because we look so much
like each other.

2253
02:06:35,400 --> 02:06:39,180
And uh,
if he wanted to have a say even if we

2254
02:06:39,181 --> 02:06:42,000
can trick our mother.
What about girlfriends?

2255
02:06:42,700 --> 02:06:44,490
Girlfriends?
No,

2256
02:06:44,790 --> 02:06:46,050
no comment.
Did you,

2257
02:06:46,060 --> 02:06:48,360
um,
do you guys have the same amount of gray

2258
02:06:48,361 --> 02:06:52,230
in your beard and the whole deal stand
next to each other we say is different

2259
02:06:52,231 --> 02:06:52,620
now.

2260
02:06:52,620 --> 02:06:55,460
What does he look like?
He's more a boulder.

2261
02:06:55,461 --> 02:06:57,540
Matt.
I am more stressed,

2262
02:06:57,940 --> 02:07:00,180
but I think more stress.
Yes.

2263
02:07:00,210 --> 02:07:03,120
does he exercise a exercise?
Yeah,

2264
02:07:03,121 --> 02:07:07,260
but uh,
he took up a lot of what I am doing,

2265
02:07:07,261 --> 02:07:09,630
but I really,
in my mind,

2266
02:07:10,020 --> 02:07:15,020
I go a lot further than he is able to.
And that's interesting that you

2267
02:07:16,260 --> 02:07:20,230
correlate that with your birth,
that you were born after hiM and then it

2268
02:07:20,240 --> 02:07:22,820
was,
there was some trauma involved and yes,

2269
02:07:22,950 --> 02:07:24,060
some stress.
So,

2270
02:07:24,830 --> 02:07:26,670
uh,
absolutely.

2271
02:07:26,690 --> 02:07:30,600
And made a psychic print.
And later my life I began to look into

2272
02:07:30,601 --> 02:07:33,690
that and you know,
the first time I went into this cold

2273
02:07:33,691 --> 02:07:37,480
water I,
I had this connection with that trauma

2274
02:07:38,080 --> 02:07:43,080
because the no other way gave me
disconnection with this deep trauma and

2275
02:07:43,691 --> 02:07:48,691
added know where it was,
who uga inflicted it or my mother tell

2276
02:07:48,710 --> 02:07:49,780
her,
told me later,

2277
02:07:50,260 --> 02:07:52,180
and then it made sense to me.

2278
02:07:52,240 --> 02:07:53,920
Oh,
that'S why.

2279
02:07:54,370 --> 02:07:59,200
That's why I like it in the cold and
because I was born into cold,

2280
02:07:59,350 --> 02:08:02,500
almost suffocated.
That's why I do these breathing

2281
02:08:02,501 --> 02:08:07,480
exercises and feel good.
FInally I'm able to tap into that

2282
02:08:07,481 --> 02:08:12,481
traumatic imprint and change the
chemistry at will controlled.

2283
02:08:13,750 --> 02:08:18,750
And then I found out I was able to do so
much more because now I was able to do

2284
02:08:18,971 --> 02:08:21,130
it consciously.
And uh,

2285
02:08:21,160 --> 02:08:22,600
from there,
uh,

2286
02:08:22,601 --> 02:08:26,170
I got into the television,
then I got into the science and it

2287
02:08:26,171 --> 02:08:31,171
appears to be that I found also a way to
tap into what we call t trauma ptsd,

2288
02:08:32,620 --> 02:08:33,760
emotion,
fear,

2289
02:08:34,340 --> 02:08:35,330
depression,
uh,

2290
02:08:35,380 --> 02:08:39,010
and not only that,
auto immune diseases,

2291
02:08:39,310 --> 02:08:42,280
possibly cancer that we still got to
find out,

2292
02:08:42,310 --> 02:08:45,320
of course,
but I think they just got a.

2293
02:08:45,770 --> 02:08:50,770
Nature's got the solutions for us,
but we need to get back into nature and

2294
02:08:53,040 --> 02:08:54,790
the nature all inside.

2295
02:08:55,210 --> 02:09:00,210
we all got a faculties,
the abilities to wake them up and to

2296
02:09:01,451 --> 02:09:04,540
bring them within our control.
And now we have shown that

2297
02:09:04,570 --> 02:09:07,030
scientifically,
within a couple of days,

2298
02:09:07,210 --> 02:09:09,850
you are able to tap into all those
systems.

2299
02:09:10,570 --> 02:09:12,850
How far we can go,
still need staff.

2300
02:09:12,970 --> 02:09:16,780
What do You think about the effect of
modern civilization traffic?

2301
02:09:17,530 --> 02:09:22,450
Just to stress and pollution,
environmental pollution,

2302
02:09:22,480 --> 02:09:24,040
pollution,
the air,

2303
02:09:24,100 --> 02:09:24,861
things like that.
WhaT,

2304
02:09:24,861 --> 02:09:25,600
what,
what kind?

2305
02:09:25,600 --> 02:09:29,400
What kind of effect do you think that
has on absolutely wrong effect to

2306
02:09:29,410 --> 02:09:33,670
chemical,
a deregulation biochemical deregulation

2307
02:09:33,671 --> 02:09:35,120
up till the dna,
bam.

2308
02:09:35,860 --> 02:09:38,180
so api genetical,
uh,

2309
02:09:38,350 --> 02:09:40,640
not only genetically,
but uh,

2310
02:09:40,660 --> 02:09:45,660
during the live you talk about
epigenetics and we are able to influence

2311
02:09:46,061 --> 02:09:50,550
into the genome structure of the dna,
but uh,

2312
02:09:51,070 --> 02:09:55,630
with a existence,
smog stress,

2313
02:09:56,170 --> 02:10:00,610
a negative thoughts and radiation of
things.

2314
02:10:00,611 --> 02:10:05,290
And I don't know all these,
we mess up the chemistry.

2315
02:10:05,860 --> 02:10:10,860
We are dealing with chemistry and we eat
food which is now not really food

2316
02:10:11,471 --> 02:10:12,910
anymore.
And we got a,

2317
02:10:13,360 --> 02:10:18,360
we are built with our,
our systems are able to do with natural

2318
02:10:18,491 --> 02:10:23,380
food and natural tribal being like
taking care of each other.

2319
02:10:23,410 --> 02:10:26,170
Brothers and sisters like tribal.
That's the way.

2320
02:10:26,290 --> 02:10:31,290
And what we do now is competition is
creating a whole lot of uncontrolled

2321
02:10:34,850 --> 02:10:39,850
getting on us all the time.
Why to server system instead of a

2322
02:10:40,640 --> 02:10:44,660
happiness strength and health care.
it's not being served anymore.

2323
02:10:44,760 --> 02:10:47,930
Everybody running behind is there a
deadline?

2324
02:10:48,140 --> 02:10:51,630
And on top of that we get food,
eh,

2325
02:10:51,860 --> 02:10:54,530
which has no,
which has messed with.

2326
02:10:54,980 --> 02:10:59,980
So we create a lot of difficulties for
our physiology that works back on our

2327
02:11:00,561 --> 02:11:05,561
brain because it's piece of meat inside
and it's just wicking on biochemical and

2328
02:11:05,871 --> 02:11:10,871
we are messing with that.
So what I found in nature is actually is

2329
02:11:11,181 --> 02:11:15,740
shortcut who learn to cleanse all the
older pollution,

2330
02:11:16,040 --> 02:11:21,040
creating a wrong chemistry,
created deregulation of the dna and

2331
02:11:21,380 --> 02:11:24,110
causing the body not to be able to deal
with,

2332
02:11:24,111 --> 02:11:25,550
say,
disease,

2333
02:11:26,420 --> 02:11:30,050
sickness and depression and all these
things.

2334
02:11:30,530 --> 02:11:32,230
Do you live in nAture?
Like where,

2335
02:11:32,240 --> 02:11:34,430
where do you live?
I live in the city,

2336
02:11:34,710 --> 02:11:36,440
uh,
at right now.

2337
02:11:36,441 --> 02:11:39,710
I live in a little village.
A little village.

2338
02:11:39,711 --> 02:11:41,000
Small town?
yes.

2339
02:11:41,030 --> 02:11:42,590
But stressful.
Uh,

2340
02:11:42,630 --> 02:11:44,690
it does not matter.
I can live anywhere.

2341
02:11:44,750 --> 02:11:49,700
You can live in New York city,
but when you freak out all the bam bam.

2342
02:11:49,701 --> 02:11:51,190
Fuck you.
Oh no,

2343
02:11:51,970 --> 02:11:52,550
no,
no.

2344
02:11:52,550 --> 02:11:57,550
I used to sit as a exercise on the
middle of this choir of the one most,

2345
02:11:59,240 --> 02:12:00,810
uh,
traffic squares.

2346
02:12:00,880 --> 02:12:04,460
So for big city in the internet islands,
which is amsterdam,

2347
02:12:05,120 --> 02:12:10,120
and just meditate on the square and with
all the cars come and go and roll,

2348
02:12:12,151 --> 02:12:13,350
jude or boom,
boom,

2349
02:12:13,351 --> 02:12:14,184
boom,
boom.

2350
02:12:14,420 --> 02:12:17,390
And I actually had a greater.
Really?

2351
02:12:17,750 --> 02:12:20,300
Yes.
We used it as a.

2352
02:12:20,960 --> 02:12:22,630
An exercise.
Yes sir.

2353
02:12:23,330 --> 02:12:24,550
Like A stressor.
Come on.

2354
02:12:24,650 --> 02:12:26,960
Yeah.
So all that chaos and madness.

2355
02:12:26,961 --> 02:12:28,580
You found your piece inside of all that.

2356
02:12:28,700 --> 02:12:33,700
He really are able to distance from and
witness how it works on your systems,

2357
02:12:36,290 --> 02:12:41,290
your nervous system,
and the nervous system then is able to

2358
02:12:41,691 --> 02:12:46,510
deal with that.
He becomes so tranquil and the more it

2359
02:12:46,520 --> 02:12:50,210
tries to get to you.
These are all exercises of yogis,

2360
02:12:50,780 --> 02:12:53,350
yogis,
they sit with four.

2361
02:12:53,360 --> 02:12:56,750
Five,
be around them or in the cold.

2362
02:12:56,780 --> 02:13:00,290
What I also did and all that.
The extremes are.

2363
02:13:00,500 --> 02:13:05,500
It's extremely great.
The feeling which derives if we just

2364
02:13:07,250 --> 02:13:12,080
witness and let go,
interfering in the systems,

2365
02:13:12,081 --> 02:13:15,650
working with the impact of what is going
on,

2366
02:13:15,890 --> 02:13:20,890
which could be stressing anyway.
So you find your own inner peAce myths,

2367
02:13:21,340 --> 02:13:25,610
all that noise and that's the way our
mInd can work.

2368
02:13:25,640 --> 02:13:27,740
That's what I do when my wife tells me
boring stories.

2369
02:13:28,250 --> 02:13:30,170
I don't even listen.
I just go into my center.

2370
02:13:31,060 --> 02:13:31,893
Dang.

2371
02:13:36,910 --> 02:13:40,560
I have to like pay attention to the
inflection that might indicate a

2372
02:13:40,561 --> 02:13:42,060
question.
God dammit.

2373
02:13:42,150 --> 02:13:45,870
Let me and when that,
you know,

2374
02:13:45,871 --> 02:13:46,704
and I go,
oh yeah,

2375
02:13:47,070 --> 02:13:50,960
yeah,
yeah.

2376
02:13:51,060 --> 02:13:53,780
Wherever we can be very stressful.
They know you.

2377
02:13:53,781 --> 02:13:57,060
So can men date to databank?
Queue down women are way better than men

2378
02:13:57,061 --> 02:13:59,460
in that regard.
Probably more stressful.

2379
02:13:59,810 --> 02:14:02,040
Especially if you're banging them right.
Jamie,

2380
02:14:02,250 --> 02:14:04,050
you know what I'm talking about.
I love them.

2381
02:14:04,051 --> 02:14:05,030
I love them.
I love the.

2382
02:14:05,190 --> 02:14:07,530
I love my wife.
I love my girlfriend.

2383
02:14:07,560 --> 02:14:11,600
Take my wife please.
Henny youngman joke.

2384
02:14:11,940 --> 02:14:12,580
Uh,
so,

2385
02:14:12,580 --> 02:14:14,480
uh,
what else?

2386
02:14:14,540 --> 02:14:17,130
Going on a lot.
Should we wrap this up?

2387
02:14:17,160 --> 02:14:18,550
You've got to tell us.
No,

2388
02:14:18,551 --> 02:14:18,991
no,
no.

2389
02:14:18,991 --> 02:14:22,110
It's all about love and it was very
lovable to be here.

2390
02:14:22,111 --> 02:14:26,100
I feel no stress whatsoever.
I did buy shit,

2391
02:14:26,110 --> 02:14:31,110
but there's a whole lot more common,
but I think the gist of it has been

2392
02:14:31,621 --> 02:14:36,540
discussed,
has been gotten out and it is a life so,

2393
02:14:36,870 --> 02:14:38,850
so interesting.
So beautiful.

2394
02:14:39,270 --> 02:14:44,270
I thank you for you being a big window
for so many and uh,

2395
02:14:44,760 --> 02:14:45,430
thank you for being

2396
02:14:45,430 --> 02:14:47,530
part of it.
It means a lot to me to,

2397
02:14:47,730 --> 02:14:50,140
to have you come back on and means a lot
to me.

2398
02:14:50,141 --> 02:14:51,840
To be able to,
uh,

2399
02:14:51,910 --> 02:14:56,860
to share your ideas with the world and
give you a platform.

2400
02:14:57,310 --> 02:14:58,143
And,
um,

2401
02:14:58,270 --> 02:15:01,030
I think what you're doing is amazing.
It's incredible.

2402
02:15:01,690 --> 02:15:05,020
It's just incredible because it's so
effective and it's so scientifically

2403
02:15:05,021 --> 02:15:07,660
proven.
It's also incredible because it's so

2404
02:15:07,661 --> 02:15:10,930
rare that there's not that many people
doing this.

2405
02:15:11,140 --> 02:15:13,720
And if there are,
they're not talking about it the way you

2406
02:15:13,721 --> 02:15:17,560
are and they're not subjecting
themselves to scientific research.

2407
02:15:18,040 --> 02:15:20,380
And I think that's,
that's one of the more amazing things

2408
02:15:20,381 --> 02:15:22,320
about it because,
uh,

2409
02:15:22,420 --> 02:15:24,190
just like that guy.
What was your friend's name?

2410
02:15:24,191 --> 02:15:26,830
Scott carney is connie.
He,

2411
02:15:26,831 --> 02:15:27,850
of course,
you know,

2412
02:15:27,851 --> 02:15:32,050
you hear these stories and you probably
assume that you're some sort of a guru,

2413
02:15:32,080 --> 02:15:36,070
crazy person running a cult,
but then he gets to meet you and he

2414
02:15:36,071 --> 02:15:36,641
goes,
oh,

2415
02:15:36,641 --> 02:15:41,410
this is one of the rare real deals.
There's not a lot of real deals out

2416
02:15:41,411 --> 02:15:43,450
there.
There's not a lot of people who are

2417
02:15:43,451 --> 02:15:47,170
really living an extraordinary life.
And you,

2418
02:15:47,260 --> 02:15:49,900
wim hoff are living an extraordinary
life.

2419
02:15:50,360 --> 02:15:51,930
Well,
that's a great.

2420
02:15:52,200 --> 02:15:56,400
And as long as people like you and me
and uh,

2421
02:15:56,430 --> 02:15:59,340
everybody who is in the same realm
exist,

2422
02:15:59,400 --> 02:16:02,790
we help the ones who want to house us.
Yes,

2423
02:16:02,880 --> 02:16:03,820
yes.
The,

2424
02:16:04,150 --> 02:16:05,550
the poor and,
and,

2425
02:16:05,551 --> 02:16:07,830
and,
and the week we are not able to do.

2426
02:16:08,040 --> 02:16:11,010
We are a strong man and you know,
the american natives,

2427
02:16:11,011 --> 02:16:14,430
they had got to.
You are being measured by the way you

2428
02:16:14,460 --> 02:16:18,300
give.
And that means not money.

2429
02:16:18,660 --> 02:16:23,660
It means his love,
effectiveness for children to feel no

2430
02:16:23,821 --> 02:16:28,821
stress and grow up for being a great
human beings because human

2431
02:16:30,080 --> 02:16:33,010
being a human being should be something
very,

2432
02:16:33,011 --> 02:16:36,220
very beautiful on this beautiful planet.
Yeah,

2433
02:16:36,221 --> 02:16:37,120
I agree,
man.

2434
02:16:37,250 --> 02:16:42,250
I tried to express to people that these
shows would not be possible if people

2435
02:16:43,661 --> 02:16:45,430
weren't listening.
I wouldn't do them.

2436
02:16:45,730 --> 02:16:48,220
Nobody would be willing to.
It's kind of an interesting thing about

2437
02:16:48,221 --> 02:16:52,240
podcasts because I couldn't just get you
to come here and just sit and talk to me

2438
02:16:52,241 --> 02:16:54,190
and nobody else would here for hours and
hours.

2439
02:16:54,490 --> 02:16:55,323
The,
the,

2440
02:16:55,560 --> 02:17:00,560
the actual mechanism of doing a podcast,
the act of doing a podcast allows me to

2441
02:17:01,790 --> 02:17:05,860
listen to these people like you and all
these other interesting people that I so

2442
02:17:05,861 --> 02:17:09,610
lucky to get to talk to,
so I benefit from it tremendously,

2443
02:17:09,790 --> 02:17:12,490
but it wouldn't exist without other
people listening.

2444
02:17:13,030 --> 02:17:17,470
So the fact that people are listening is
what makes me read these things and we

2445
02:17:17,520 --> 02:17:20,080
thank the people who are listening right
now.

2446
02:17:20,460 --> 02:17:22,240
Oh,
from our heart.

2447
02:17:22,450 --> 02:17:23,920
Yes,
absolutely.

2448
02:17:23,980 --> 02:17:26,320
Absolutely.
If it wasn't for them like that does.

2449
02:17:26,321 --> 02:17:27,880
That sounds so cliche.
Hey,

2450
02:17:27,881 --> 02:17:29,200
if it wasn't for you guys,
we couldn't do it,

2451
02:17:29,470 --> 02:17:31,600
but there would be no reason there'd be
no.

2452
02:17:31,620 --> 02:17:33,540
It wouldn't be no motivation.
If,

2453
02:17:33,670 --> 02:17:37,840
if it wasn't for people listening that
there would be no show,

2454
02:17:38,050 --> 02:17:39,850
it wouldn't exist.
I would never have met.

2455
02:17:39,851 --> 02:17:42,700
You have never met all the extraordinary
people that I've met.

2456
02:17:43,330 --> 02:17:48,330
I'm very eager to see what this is going
to do and because the last time I met

2457
02:17:50,441 --> 02:17:54,400
you and afterwards I hear joe rogan
everywhere,

2458
02:17:54,401 --> 02:17:56,110
everywhere,
everywhere since that.

2459
02:17:56,590 --> 02:18:00,130
So I came here now,
well I'm going to go to the joe rogan,

2460
02:18:00,131 --> 02:18:05,131
but then at the moment my bad,
that expectation,

2461
02:18:05,230 --> 02:18:08,920
heaviness fell off.
I'm just going to say my thing.

2462
02:18:09,180 --> 02:18:10,870
Yeah.
I'm being allied with him.

2463
02:18:10,960 --> 02:18:14,260
Just have a good time.
Like last time I had and we did.

2464
02:18:14,410 --> 02:18:16,320
We had a great time I think.
Oh yeah,

2465
02:18:16,321 --> 02:18:17,001
yeah,
yeah,

2466
02:18:17,001 --> 02:18:17,551
yeah,
yeah,

2467
02:18:17,551 --> 02:18:18,300
yeah.
It was great.

2468
02:18:18,300 --> 02:18:20,260
It was great.
You've become friends with my friend

2469
02:18:20,261 --> 02:18:22,280
chris ryan.
Oh yeah.

2470
02:18:22,290 --> 02:18:24,550
Hey.
Oh,

2471
02:18:24,551 --> 02:18:26,020
that's his shirt.
Shirt,

2472
02:18:26,110 --> 02:18:27,560
man.
Civilized to death.

2473
02:18:29,870 --> 02:18:31,120
Yeah.
I love chris.

2474
02:18:31,330 --> 02:18:33,730
He's awesome.
I do a podcast with him and duncan

2475
02:18:33,731 --> 02:18:35,170
trussell,
we call it the shrimp parade.

2476
02:18:35,470 --> 02:18:36,270
We do it.
Uh,

2477
02:18:36,270 --> 02:18:37,880
it's just like,
it's completely informal.

2478
02:18:37,881 --> 02:18:41,590
Like we'll do one episode of my podcast
and we'll do one episode of dunkin's,

2479
02:18:41,591 --> 02:18:44,650
one episode of chris's and we just sort
of rotate back and forth between each

2480
02:18:44,651 --> 02:18:47,950
other when chris was in town,
but chris was living in barcelona for a

2481
02:18:47,951 --> 02:18:49,030
little what?
Little bit,

2482
02:18:49,031 --> 02:18:52,140
but now he's back so soon.
But he,

2483
02:18:52,200 --> 02:18:53,200
he,
he loves you too.

2484
02:18:53,350 --> 02:18:54,510
He had a great time with you.
Yeah,

2485
02:18:54,511 --> 02:18:55,001
yeah,
yeah.

2486
02:18:55,001 --> 02:18:59,620
I just had a podcast with him and say a
week ago or something together with a

2487
02:18:59,860 --> 02:19:04,860
professor.
I don't remember his name for people

2488
02:19:04,960 --> 02:19:07,390
want to listen.
It's called tangentially speaking and

2489
02:19:07,391 --> 02:19:10,240
it's available on itunes and it's
available on a.

2490
02:19:10,540 --> 02:19:15,140
Is it chris ryan.com is that is a dr
chris ryan dotcom,

2491
02:19:15,180 --> 02:19:16,840
maybe ryan phd.com.

2492
02:19:17,020 --> 02:19:19,510
Chris ryan.
Phd.com.

2493
02:19:20,320 --> 02:19:23,620
I think that's also his twitter handle
and chris is awesome.

2494
02:19:23,621 --> 02:19:26,290
He's a great storyteller.
He's a brilliant,

2495
02:19:26,291 --> 02:19:28,730
brilliant guy and he also has a great
book.

2496
02:19:29,390 --> 02:19:32,060
Yeah.
What is it about the sex,

2497
02:19:32,100 --> 02:19:35,610
the sex of dawning of downing of sex
lives.

2498
02:19:35,720 --> 02:19:37,730
What is it called?
Sex at dawn.

2499
02:19:37,890 --> 02:19:39,050
Sex at dawn?
Yeah.

2500
02:19:39,070 --> 02:19:42,560
It's a great book.
Why did you throw it in the garbage?

2501
02:19:43,250 --> 02:19:44,810
It's so good.
My friend's wife threw it in the

2502
02:19:44,811 --> 02:19:46,310
garbage.
She started reading it.

2503
02:19:46,311 --> 02:19:48,560
She goes,
you are not reading this and chucked it

2504
02:19:48,561 --> 02:19:50,300
in the trash.
Yeah.

2505
02:19:50,360 --> 02:19:53,390
I do not agree really with this sexual,
uh,

2506
02:19:53,410 --> 02:19:56,200
you know,
explanations about how their day went

2507
02:19:56,201 --> 02:20:01,201
and why we have these urges like from
the prehistoric where you don't agree at

2508
02:20:03,720 --> 02:20:05,950
a scientist.
Yeah,

2509
02:20:05,960 --> 02:20:06,720
yeah,
yeah.

2510
02:20:06,720 --> 02:20:11,720
What do you think scientists would that
right now we have a ability to

2511
02:20:13,520 --> 02:20:18,520
consciously choose a woman and in this
world it's not about going and

2512
02:20:20,151 --> 02:20:25,151
spreadsheet seed everywhere now it just
be with one woman consciously,

2513
02:20:25,700 --> 02:20:26,240
you know?

2514
02:20:26,240 --> 02:20:28,790
Yeah.
But that's not really what he's saying.

2515
02:20:28,791 --> 02:20:32,030
What he's saying.
He's sort of trying to explain the,

2516
02:20:32,090 --> 02:20:36,590
the yes,
I know the origins of these urges and I

2517
02:20:36,591 --> 02:20:41,060
think he's very intelligent and uh,
what he does is great work because he

2518
02:20:41,061 --> 02:20:43,640
wakes up a whole lot of.
He's very.

2519
02:20:43,641 --> 02:20:44,900
Yeah,
it's very controversial,

2520
02:20:44,901 --> 02:20:49,160
but it's very rooted in science.
He's got this story with this cat.

2521
02:20:49,940 --> 02:20:50,721
A cat.
Yeah.

2522
02:20:50,721 --> 02:20:55,710
Making sex with the cat.
He had sex with a cat and I tell that

2523
02:20:55,711 --> 02:20:57,420
story.
Tell that story.

2524
02:20:57,680 --> 02:21:00,010
Not really.
We got a boner as cat.

2525
02:21:00,170 --> 02:21:04,580
Not really that something by figuring
out what are they?

2526
02:21:04,581 --> 02:21:07,250
A cat.
The cat sexuality was all about it.

2527
02:21:07,700 --> 02:21:08,750
That's right.
That's right.

2528
02:21:08,780 --> 02:21:11,660
I did tell those stories with my dogs.
Oh boy.

2529
02:21:12,580 --> 02:21:17,180
To end the show
on the lag and all that.

2530
02:21:17,390 --> 02:21:18,840
I mean,
we're all doing.

2531
02:21:18,990 --> 02:21:19,823
Wait,
wait,

2532
02:21:19,850 --> 02:21:20,683
wait.
Yeah.

2533
02:21:21,540 --> 02:21:22,373
Yeah,
I see.

2534
02:21:22,400 --> 02:21:23,100
Yes.
I,

2535
02:21:23,100 --> 02:21:24,120
I,
I just,

2536
02:21:24,590 --> 02:21:27,420
because we want to find out it shouldn't
be,

2537
02:21:27,421 --> 02:21:28,850
you know,
taboo on sex.

2538
02:21:28,890 --> 02:21:31,720
Maybe we should have proper education.
Darin.

2539
02:21:32,150 --> 02:21:35,990
Yes.
We haven't really stopped the sexual

2540
02:21:36,320 --> 02:21:41,320
behavior and then it gets into these
perverted ways anyway because of the

2541
02:21:42,170 --> 02:21:45,890
power and it is not able to grow into
love.

2542
02:21:45,950 --> 02:21:49,040
Yes.
And that should be how we end this.

2543
02:21:49,900 --> 02:21:51,200
Yeah.
Don't suppress shit.

2544
02:21:51,770 --> 02:21:53,320
Be loving.
Yes sir.

2545
02:21:53,840 --> 02:21:55,280
Rock on wim hoff.
Right on.

2546
02:21:55,340 --> 02:21:56,260
Thank you my brother.
Thank you.

2547
02:21:56,261 --> 02:21:57,140
I really appreciate it.
Thank you.

2548
02:21:57,350 --> 02:21:59,300
Always going to do it again next
october.

2549
02:21:59,360 --> 02:22:01,490
Yes.
Hello ladies and gentlemen.

2550
02:22:01,760 --> 02:22:02,630
Thank you.
Goodnight.

2551
02:22:13,050 --> 02:22:13,710
Mm.
