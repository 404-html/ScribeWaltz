1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,170
Hey everybody,
this is a very special podcast,

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:06,020
very special Saturday afternoon 
podcasts.

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:11,250
We'll watch an old fight from 1954.
That's supposed to be a pro wrestling 

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,771
match with Gary Tonin,
one of the best Jujitsu artists in 

5
00:00:15,771 --> 00:00:19,401
America today,
one of the hot young fucking killers of 

6
00:00:19,401 --> 00:00:19,920
grappling.
And of course my brother Eddie Bravo.

7
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:25,070
Yo Yo Holler.
And we're watching this video that we 

8
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:25,410
found.
All of us found this on the underground.

9
00:00:25,411 --> 00:00:27,300
Someone posted it.
I'll have to give the dude props.

10
00:00:27,301 --> 00:00:32,301
I forget his name,
but it's a Kamora the guy who the 

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,120
shoulder lock,
the Camorra was named after because you 

12
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,571
use it on Leo Gracie back in.
What was that like the forties or 

13
00:00:41,571 --> 00:00:42,980
something like that man from adult?
No,

14
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:49,130
well this is only 1962.
I would would know it was a long ass 

15
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:51,120
time with black and white point point 
being,

16
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,290
um,
he,

17
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:57,350
he was uh,
he did some pro wrestling and he did a 

18
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:57,390
pro wrestling match with this guy.

19
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,520
I think I'm selling this saying this 
right.

20
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,210
Riquito were Ketos on where?
Ketos on.

21
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,100
I hope I'm saying that right.
I'm just reading.

22
00:01:05,101 --> 00:01:07,440
I never heard anybody say it.
That's a big Japanese.

23
00:01:07,441 --> 00:01:09,510
He's huge.
He's huge.

24
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:14,930
And this match starts out like this 
starts out of pro wrestling match where 

25
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:15,570
they're like,
you know,

26
00:01:15,571 --> 00:01:20,571
they're like doing a bunch of stuff.
They're kind of allowing each other to 

27
00:01:20,571 --> 00:01:23,190
push each other around in there.
Somewhere in the match.

28
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:28,290
It becomes like a war.
And the big dude,

29
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,800
that right there kicked the ball.
So the righthand and this,

30
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,220
this just turns into a fight.
This is a 100 percent of fight now.

31
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,290
Oh yeah.
He's looking around panicking.

32
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:41,040
He's panicking.
He tries to clench and this is real.

33
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:43,740
Now this is a real single,
like he's fucked up.

34
00:01:43,741 --> 00:01:45,720
Look,
the referee says don't do that.

35
00:01:45,721 --> 00:01:47,190
And boom,
he punched him in the face.

36
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:49,200
He's poking him in.
The eyes kicks out.

37
00:01:49,201 --> 00:01:50,610
Oh Shit,
someone get.

38
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:52,730
Wait for this though.
Gets even crazier.

39
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,050
Look at this hand slaps you soccer.
Kicks Him,

40
00:01:55,051 --> 00:01:56,700
man.
He had the headlock.

41
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,320
Some.
This is totally real now.

42
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:04,410
Holy Shit.
I mean he's fucked up right now and this

43
00:02:04,411 --> 00:02:09,411
dude is still beating his ass.
My referee doesn't know if it's fake or 

44
00:02:09,721 --> 00:02:10,230
not.
I guess,

45
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:12,210
I don't know,
I mean,

46
00:02:12,211 --> 00:02:13,080
what's.
Check this out.

47
00:02:13,081 --> 00:02:15,330
Here's the finishing Combo.
The referee looks at his eyes.

48
00:02:15,331 --> 00:02:18,070
You'll find back in.
Oh yeah,

49
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,400
he's great.
I think the refs afraid of kicking his 

50
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,671
ass to the park and look at that.
Left the left hand that he dropped him 

51
00:02:25,671 --> 00:02:25,671
with a hundred percent.
Legit.

52
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,560
One hundred percent.
Legit back that up just a little bit.

53
00:02:28,561 --> 00:02:30,150
Jamie,
to that last combination.

54
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,130
Right about there.
I mean this.

55
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,510
You don't fake shit like this.
Like when when he stood up,

56
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,160
when he saw was a little bit before 
this.

57
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,040
Jim Did he soccer?
Kicked him go a little bit before this.

58
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,650
Yeah,
but he was against the hips right there,

59
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:44,310
Jimmy.
That's good.

60
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:50,090
See,
this is when the dude is desperately 

61
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:50,090
scrambling trying to take him to the 
ground.

62
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:51,960
And Ricky on again.
I hope I'm saying that right.

63
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:57,200
He's beating that ass.
He was mostly doing open hands but he's 

64
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,770
kicking him too and then he kicks him 
again.

65
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,160
Boom.
The bitch slap right to the IR.

66
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,390
Did he come?
We'll walk to the rather and look at him

67
00:03:04,391 --> 00:03:04,990
and said,
dude,

68
00:03:04,991 --> 00:03:07,810
what the fuck is going on here?
Look at the boom.

69
00:03:07,811 --> 00:03:10,720
I mean that is.
You cannot fake head kicks like that.

70
00:03:10,721 --> 00:03:14,800
That's 100 percent legit.
This guy is getting the fuck beat out of

71
00:03:14,801 --> 00:03:16,570
him.
It's crazy,

72
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,250
man.
I mean he gets up.

73
00:03:18,251 --> 00:03:20,890
He's already really,
really badly fucked up.

74
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:23,440
Like the referee checks is.
Dude,

75
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:28,580
don't worry about your.
I think there's a good chance that that 

76
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:30,310
knockout was just him.
Like,

77
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:35,311
I don't know how to end this.
Let me just drop to the fucking floor 

78
00:03:35,311 --> 00:03:35,800
and pretend like I can't breathe.
May Be Right.

79
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,870
That last left hand holding onto the 
road.

80
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,760
He got fucked up.
Man.

81
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
That's so crazy.
I've never seen anything like that 

82
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,000
before.
A down dude.

83
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,720
Stay.
Stay down where it starts out just to 

84
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,281
pro wrestling.
Match and turns into full on Valley 

85
00:03:53,281 --> 00:03:53,281
Tuto.
See,

86
00:03:53,281 --> 00:03:57,361
this is so cool.
We were talking about this before the 

87
00:03:57,361 --> 00:03:59,641
podcast started that it's so cool that 
shit like this exists and we can watch 

88
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:02,970
some like historical moments in martial 
arts.

89
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,440
This is a historical moment.
Wow.

90
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:09,970
I wonder what the aftermath was.
Did the guy match or something?

91
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,140
No,
he got murdered.

92
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:14,380
Who got murdered?
The big guy because of this problem.

93
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:18,430
That's the story that you know,
that's the legend is true.

94
00:04:18,431 --> 00:04:23,431
Who knows what I would glean to believe 
that that guy got his ass thoroughly 

95
00:04:24,341 --> 00:04:25,090
kicked.
He got.

96
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:30,490
He got a double.
Crossed him on TV and he couldn't abide.

97
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:31,540
Yeah.
Yeah.

98
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:33,040
He could have died.
He was getting soccer.

99
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:38,041
Kicked hard.
I can definitely see Komora having some 

100
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:41,431
deep connections with the Yakuza and 
they said we got to kill this 

101
00:04:41,431 --> 00:04:41,431
motherfucker.
That said,

102
00:04:41,431 --> 00:04:42,370
no rematch,
no grappling match.

103
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,840
No submission.
Only.

104
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,530
No metamorris kill this motherfucker.
Just self killing them.

105
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,200
Killing them.
Quit.

106
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:57,540
They get ugly.
The dude who put the video up is Ian 

107
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,310
Paisley is my hero.
That's his name on the underground.

108
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:05,580
So thanks to that dude.
That was one of the most brutal ass 

109
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,341
kickings every time caught on video.
And there's another dude who posted 

110
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:12,781
something.
His name is a p o l o n I s t a polo.

111
00:05:12,821 --> 00:05:14,230
Nice dot.
I guess you'd say it.

112
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:19,590
Um,
and he wrote a whole breakdown of what 

113
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:19,590
happened and apparently this Nikita's on
guy,

114
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:24,960
you know,
Kimora was saying that recruiters on 

115
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,800
that he got taken for greed and the 
money and the fame,

116
00:05:26,801 --> 00:05:29,500
he lost his mind and just started 
beating the fuck out of the dude.

117
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:34,860
And so apparently they stabbed him with 
a urine soaked knife.

118
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:38,390
That's what the story is.
This is so crazy.

119
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:42,720
Who's died?
Like days later we ran out of the poison

120
00:05:42,721 --> 00:05:47,721
to maybe only your own kits in Saudi.
You're fucked.

121
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:49,010
Well,
you know,

122
00:05:49,011 --> 00:05:52,060
they do those poop things where they 
take poop and they transfer,

123
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:55,420
they transmit fecal matter,
transplant it to someone's,

124
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:58,010
a intestinal tract and apparently it's

125
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:01,790
supposed to be like good for your body.
Like to get that bacteria,

126
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:05,510
like somebody else's bacteria in your 
body through a fecal transplant.

127
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,340
Makes Sense.
Kind of,

128
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,720
but not really.
Right.

129
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,460
You wouldn't want to.
That helps.

130
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:15,620
That helped you think I'm joking.
There's no waiting list for that shit.

131
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,930
Yeah.
You wait two years for kidney liver.

132
00:06:20,931 --> 00:06:22,340
Shit,
dude.

133
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:27,341
You better be white.
Fresh shit should be at the operating 

134
00:06:32,361 --> 00:06:32,870
table.
No,

135
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:34,750
they got fresh shit.
Yeah.

136
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,650
The doctors just shit,
right.

137
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:43,110
Dr.
Deacon Hormones.

138
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,950
No added hormones.
Tired all the time.

139
00:06:45,951 --> 00:06:50,440
You need.
You guys gave me some bullshit.

140
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:56,540
It just doesn't happen.
The right amino acid chains.

141
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:59,970
So this guy ricky cheetos on like if 
you,

142
00:06:59,971 --> 00:07:02,880
if you watch that,
that might be like one of the first ever

143
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,890
double crosses that's on,
like,

144
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:10,950
like video.
I don't think there's anything like 

145
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:10,950
that.
Our worldstar hip hop,

146
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:10,950
right?

147
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:20,260
So clear.
Even though it's black and white 100 

148
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,921
years ago,
you see the strikes clearly and there's 

149
00:07:22,921 --> 00:07:24,550
lights and that's one of the thug life 
video.

150
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,680
Someone's definitely going sunglasses 
with drop down when he got his hands up 

151
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,400
for real man,
that's,

152
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,640
that's a ruthless.
Ruth was beat down.

153
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:41,650
Not Quite as ruthless as that night.
Fucking horrible,

154
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:46,600
horrible man telling me about it.
But I just didn't.

155
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:47,490
I wasn't,
uh,

156
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:49,540
I wasn't,
I just didn't get to it.

157
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:50,680
And then finally someone said,
dude,

158
00:07:50,681 --> 00:07:52,660
sit down.
Watch this shit.

159
00:07:52,661 --> 00:07:53,070
I've.
Oh,

160
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:55,150
okay.
Well it's brutal too.

161
00:07:55,151 --> 00:07:57,530
We watched it on the air.
Yeah,

162
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,740
we watched it live.
Not Live,

163
00:07:59,741 --> 00:08:02,500
but the first time I saw it and it was 
unbelievable.

164
00:08:02,501 --> 00:08:07,501
It was hard.
It's hard to imagine that someone could 

165
00:08:07,501 --> 00:08:07,501
do that.
Just ran those dudes over.

166
00:08:07,501 --> 00:08:10,540
He's saying that now that the video is 
out and now he's gonna.

167
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,840
People are gonna.
See the truth that it was self defense 

168
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,610
gun.
He's crazy.

169
00:08:17,611 --> 00:08:19,420
That's what he said.
I said one guys coming after him.

170
00:08:19,421 --> 00:08:24,421
I said gun.
That's why we had to run them over 

171
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:24,421
because of the gun,
but there was a.

172
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:24,850
It seems like there was a gun in that 
video.

173
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:30,450
I mean,
or something that the guy took out and 

174
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:30,880
put in the gun spot behind your lower 
back.

175
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,890
Let me just.
Someone ever do that with a chrome like,

176
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:35,770
man,
let me get his comb.

177
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,840
Kick it in the crack of your butt.
You only put guns back there.

178
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:43,390
When a guy does that and he sticks 
something behind their back.

179
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:45,760
It's owning a gun.
It's never a cell phone.

180
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,040
It's never anything else.
It's a fucking gun.

181
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,870
That's it.
It's a gun.

182
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,640
Nobody puts anything back there but a 
gun.

183
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:54,870
W what?
What the fuck else you hold behind belts

184
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:56,220
between

185
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,490
your ass cheeks and your pants belts.
When I get promotions,

186
00:08:59,491 --> 00:09:04,491
I hide it behind my,
but that's the only thing that's going 

187
00:09:04,491 --> 00:09:05,660
to promote him.
Your honor,

188
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:11,610
you've been training for a straight 
three times a week.

189
00:09:11,611 --> 00:09:16,611
You're on three times.
I have the documents here three times a 

190
00:09:16,611 --> 00:09:18,330
week for two years.
She was due for his brown belt.

191
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:21,660
Yeah.
Well he ran over the brown belt too.

192
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:26,670
Then he wrote over that dude.
That dude apparently lived.

193
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,870
The second guy died.
The second guy ran over his head.

194
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,750
Yes.
The Guy who went flying off screen.

195
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,890
Frog,
man.

196
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:38,700
Yeah.
That's the stories about that.

197
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,910
They're gonna.
Those are gonna.

198
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,990
Go on for eternity.
The rap world.

199
00:09:42,991 --> 00:09:43,830
Holy Shit.
If you're,

200
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,580
if you're in that rap music world,
the more famous you get.

201
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,640
It's like in China,
the more famous you get in China,

202
00:09:50,641 --> 00:09:52,110
the triads takeover.
You know what I mean?

203
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:53,630
They're like,
you got to pay us on.

204
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:56,140
We're responsible for this shit.
You know,

205
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,280
we own the movie houses or whatever,
and in the rap world,

206
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,750
the Tei is always walking around with 
the gun.

207
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:07,760
He went to jail.
It's like it's people are killing each 

208
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,791
other and get to big man.
It's crazy how much the world is 

209
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:14,260
attached to like organized crime or 
crime or violence,

210
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:19,290
so it's okay because we accepted Nwa.
Nwa was not real.

211
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:24,910
It was.
It was like a like slayer pretending 

212
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:27,441
they were satanic.
Nwa The dudes pretending to be ruthless 

213
00:10:27,441 --> 00:10:29,070
gangsters in that album.
You can even do an album like that.

214
00:10:29,071 --> 00:10:34,071
Now they rape a 14 year old,
a preacher's daughter in the drive in 

215
00:10:34,481 --> 00:10:36,140
and one of the songs,
a fortune,

216
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,360
they're pulling a train on her and the 
singing about it.

217
00:10:39,361 --> 00:10:42,810
It's a song about that.
And then a song about killing hookers.

218
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:48,260
One less bitch I got to worry about.
They have like little acting scenes in 

219
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:53,151
between every song.
There's a scene where they pull up next 

220
00:10:53,151 --> 00:10:53,151
to a hooker and she goes,
hey,

221
00:10:53,151 --> 00:10:53,220
when you want,
what'd you do?

222
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,910
What'd you want to come in?
And Oh look,

223
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,620
you let me go shoot that bitch.
Shoot that bitch.

224
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:01,230
That bitch.
That's part.

225
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:04,310
That's before one less bitch.
You know what I mean?

226
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,690
That's okay.
So we accepted all that shit.

227
00:11:06,691 --> 00:11:08,610
So not just accepted it,
they sold it.

228
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,960
Yeah,
and it was huge.

229
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:10,980
Huge.
I mean it wasn't.

230
00:11:10,981 --> 00:11:12,480
None of it was true.
It was just,

231
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:17,520
it was like the extra and it's like a.
The director and the writer,

232
00:11:17,521 --> 00:11:19,950
they're not satanic.
Do you think that doing that though,

233
00:11:19,951 --> 00:11:24,951
just open the door to real thugs.
Like how many real thoughts you've seen 

234
00:11:25,501 --> 00:11:27,360

is real or not,

238
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:37,260
but this is.
It's the craziest thing ever.

239
00:11:37,261 --> 00:11:42,110

It's incredible.

They went and looked at,

273
00:13:25,451 --> 00:13:26,520
looked at it and oh,

274
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:28,490
not these guys,
but there are people like this.

275
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,490
Not In the same car or anything like 
that.

276
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:33,440
Famous rap,
but not these guys.

277
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,140
Oh yeah.
I had heard that recently.

278
00:13:36,141 --> 00:13:41,141
Some guy is in jail,
some guy from San Diego for like a 

279
00:13:41,141 --> 00:13:45,161
rapper and he's flashing gang signs.
He's had no criminal history at all as 

280
00:13:45,161 --> 00:13:45,890
different thing too.
It's a different thing to.

281

that's a wonderful video.
I liked his style.

283
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,750
I like his office and he's got the 
puppy.

284
00:13:53,751 --> 00:13:55,220
That's the best day.

But he's got the cutest little puppy 
though.

286
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:02,360
Balance out all the gold.
Have you seen the white kid with tattoos

He calls himself stitches.

00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,420

303
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:01,370
This is Florida.
That's what this is.

304
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:07,010
This is my new favorite rapper.
I tell it to you is better than 

305
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:09,701
Trinidad.
Jazz tells you like it's got to be 

306
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:09,701
sweet,
and then this one,

307
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:11,500
he's got all platinum teeth or gold 
cartel.

308
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,490
The videos.
Some rifles.

309
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:15,870
Assault,
right?

310
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,340
Exactly.
He needs a tank.

311
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,920
Got To take your tank and wolverine.
Is that Hell hellraiser?

312
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,180
I love smelling.
Selling.

313
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,910
Oh,
I love selling blow.

314
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:42,910
He's running around with guns.
Cocaine all over that.

315
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:45,320
Say I love selling blow,
but it's.

316
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,720
It's flashing the word.
Yeah,

317
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,070
I love it.
That was important.

318
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,690
We have to make sure that the audience 
understands that.

319
00:15:53,691 --> 00:15:58,691
I don't think it's clear enough.
You know what he said was arguments 

320
00:15:58,691 --> 00:15:58,691
about it.
Yeah.

321
00:15:58,691 --> 00:15:58,691
You know what he's doing,
man.

322
00:15:58,691 --> 00:15:58,691
He's like,
okay,

323
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:00,470
everybody thinks they're crazy.
Watch this.

324
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:03,710
Watch this.
When you think you fucking top the crazy

325
00:16:03,711 --> 00:16:04,790
Olympics,
motherfucker.

326
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:08,030
I'm going to tattoo guns on my face and 
stitches.

327
00:16:08,031 --> 00:16:10,310
I'm only 18 and I'm just going to say 
it.

328
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,830
I love selling.
Blow doesn't want to say it.

329
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:16,130
I'm going to print it across the screen.
I didn't have a gun in ever seen.

330
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:24,510
Wow.
Does he?

331
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:27,650
He doesn't even have any white friends.
What's up with that?

332
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,300
It's racist.
No,

333
00:16:29,301 --> 00:16:31,230
you're better off.
This is the.

334
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:33,800
This is the way you guys video.
He's the only white guy.

335
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,370
White guys are laying there getting 
away.

336
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,690
Except for him.
He probably hates white people.

337
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,030
Now what you're gonna do with it.
That's what you get.

338
00:16:46,031 --> 00:16:47,840
What I'm saying?
It's going to be all day.

339
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:50,580
It's going to be in your head now.
What going to do with it now?

340
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:55,620
What you're gonna do.
It's gonna be my new tagline after I 

341
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:55,620
submit people.
Yeah.

342
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,210
Now what's she going to do with it?
That's rude.

343
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,660
Gary Coleman.
Gary.

344
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:03,290
You first win and then stick.
The White Guy was a hell raiser guy.

345
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,970
You know what I mean?
I think that was him.

346
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,700
I think that was him with a mask on that
was supposed to be him.

347
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,110
I've just.
My interpretation of it,

348
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:15,760
I think he should have.
He should have stayed 100 percent black 

349
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,310
shit.
Hell raiser kind of brought it back to 

350
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:20,531
white people because black people don't 
like hell raiser and should've been 

351
00:17:20,531 --> 00:17:20,531
spawn or stockton,
you know,

352
00:17:20,531 --> 00:17:24,910
that's very good point because hell 
raiser was a white guy in the movie and 

353
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:28,640
black people hate scary movies generally
speaking.

354
00:17:28,641 --> 00:17:33,641
I'm sure.
Scary movies generally all 

355
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:39,540
stereotypical,
stereotypical generalizations of how to 

356
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:39,540
raise up people.

357
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:46,210
You got to be able to generalize,
generalize,

358
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:51,330
you know what I mean?
Cause if you can generalize and you 

359
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:51,330
can't make any fucking points,
that's so true.

360
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:52,860
You know what I mean?
You can't make any points.

361
00:17:52,861 --> 00:17:54,690
I know.
I know one guy that doesn't do that.

362
00:17:54,691 --> 00:17:56,610
My yes,
I know a guy too,

363
00:17:56,611 --> 00:18:01,200
but generally Jesus Christ,
that's one of the things are.

364
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:03,060
Before you say what you just said,
you go,

365
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:08,240
yeah,
I know this might sound a little bit 

366
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:08,240
racist,
but I'm not racist.

367
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,660
But you ever see that twitter feed?
I'm not racist.

368
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:13,170
It's all people saying racist shit.
I'm not racist.

369
00:18:13,171 --> 00:18:16,710
But then they say some racist shit that 
was the most racist.

370
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:20,910
How can you read some racist shit and 
not be accused of being racist?

371
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,800
We'll find out.
I don't think so,

372
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:28,580
definitely not because if someone said,
if someone was telling a story about 

373
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:31,510
some racist white guy who said the n 
word to a black guy,

374
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:32,940
the black guy hit him or something.

375
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:38,300
Oh,
can you tell that story and use and use 

376
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:38,460
that word or do you have to say it again
when describing the story?

377
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,410
It's a tough one,
right?

378
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:45,680
Because Howard stern just says the word 
because when he talks about someone 

379
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:45,900
else,
so you get this one right here.

380
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,800
Jamie.
Stop right there.

381
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:52,820
I'm not racist,
but will not stand to see my country 

382
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,600
attacked by black whiners that feel 
sorry for themselves.

383
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,710
Quit.
Quit breaking the law ass.

384
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:58,070
Oh,
this is.

385
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:02,780
These are real well put.
Well put what?

386
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,600
He's got a fucking moron.
There's a difference between high levels

387
00:19:09,961 --> 00:19:14,490
of African American and a n word.
Yeah.

388
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:19,430
You don't even say the word until I'm 
Mexican,

389
00:19:19,431 --> 00:19:24,431
so I.
I could actually get away with it if I 

390
00:19:24,431 --> 00:19:24,431
say an Igg Iga,
but am I.

391
00:19:24,431 --> 00:19:25,920
I can't do the other one,
but you can't even say it.

392
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:27,160
You can't not.

393
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:30,900
Not even calling something it not 
calling a person a nigger,

394
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,450
but saying the word like me saying it 
right now and you're like,

395
00:19:33,451 --> 00:19:35,160
oh,
you can't say it.

396
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,240
How come you didn't say it?
He just did it.

397
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,620
You know,
it's,

398
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,200
it's,
I think it's awesome.

399
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:43,110
Like,
you know what I mean?

400
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,580
They have a word.
It's no big deal.

401
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:48,830
But like what if you got one until you 
can say wetback and stuff too.

402
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:51,840
What if you're like reading to like a 
group of small children.

403
00:19:51,841 --> 00:19:54,540
You know,
if the guy had called me a wetback,

404
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,360
that would be very offensive.
That doesn't seem that.

405
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,230
It's not quite as strong as the n word,
but it's,

406
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,320
it's up there.
It's like bronze metal.

407
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,710
You know what I mean?
An end is like the gold metal year after

408
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:09,480
year.
Not even being racist,

409
00:20:09,481 --> 00:20:14,481
but walking behind black people in the 
hallways is the last place I ever want 

410
00:20:14,481 --> 00:20:14,481
to be.
No,

411
00:20:14,481 --> 00:20:14,640
no.
That's exactly what you're.

412
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,860
What the.
Not even being racist.

413
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,510
Oh my God.
I'm literally,

414
00:20:24,511 --> 00:20:29,511
I literally am not racist at all,
but like I don't get why a lot of black 

415
00:20:29,821 --> 00:20:33,120
people feel the need to be ignorant 
literally all the time.

416
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:36,210
Wow.
Wow.

417
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:41,100
He's talking about Trinidad James.
There's a double double literally and no

418
00:20:41,101 --> 00:20:42,990
period.
I'm not feeling that sense.

419
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,470
I'm not racist,
but.

420
00:20:46,471 --> 00:20:48,220
But what is it?
Caucasians,

421
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,340
Caucasians are evil as hell.
Smh,

422
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:53,860
I've got a real issue with Smh,
which,

423
00:20:53,861 --> 00:20:55,480
what does that mean again?
Shaking my head.

424
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:58,930
I am just stop,
stop,

425
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:01,720
cut the shit.
Especially white people.

426
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,410
Oh my God.
Look at this one.

427
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:06,790
I'm not racist,
but Justin,

428
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:11,791
please stop hanging with black people.
They are making you too ghetto people 

429
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:16,441
think you're trying to be black.
Seth Rogan said about Justin Bieber,

430
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:18,430
Howard Stern.
He said,

431
00:21:18,431 --> 00:21:19,680
uh,
that uh,

432
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:21,640
he thought he was going to meet Justin.
He thought,

433
00:21:21,641 --> 00:21:24,400
okay,
he's going to actually be a cool guy.

434
00:21:24,401 --> 00:21:26,050
Watch.
He expected me to be a cool guy,

435
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:30,220
but seth throw him under the bus and he 
said he was a uh,

436
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,230
I don't know the exact words.
I don't.

437
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:35,920
Just the opposite of cool.
Not,

438
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:38,040
not a nice guy,
a Douche bag.

439
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:41,020
But you know what,
I thought about that.

440
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:46,630
He got so famous,
so young and he's really fucking good 

441
00:21:46,661 --> 00:21:47,720
looking.
He's.

442
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:52,240
He's a guest model now.
He's on sunset and he's got his leg with

443
00:21:52,241 --> 00:21:55,750
the CIC for gas or something like that.
The guy's a really good looking guy.

444
00:21:55,751 --> 00:21:57,620
If he.
If he didn't have a.

445
00:21:57,810 --> 00:22:00,340
He wasn't a musician,
he would still get mad chick.

446
00:22:00,341 --> 00:22:05,341
So how is a guy like that not going to 
be a Douche bag and possibly it is 

447
00:22:05,341 --> 00:22:06,880
tough.
He's up against them.

448
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:11,970
Impossible.
Everybody's kissing his ass all fucking 

449
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:12,220
day.
He's really good looking.

450
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,210
We can sing.
He can.

451
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,220
He's very talented.
I mean his songs.

452
00:22:15,221 --> 00:22:17,860
I would never buy a cds,
but the dude can sing really good.

453
00:22:17,861 --> 00:22:19,870
He could play guitar.
He shreds on drums.

454
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,720
He's been a musician his whole life.
He's actually very talented,

455
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,310
but there's no way that guy's going to 
make it through the teens.

456
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:27,550
And I was 21,
22,

457
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:33,200
21 night just.
But how you going to get there through 

458
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,030
all that and not be a Douche bag.
It's impossible.

459
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:38,770
Is a recent scientific study done that 
proves that assholes get more chicks.

460
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:42,990
John Danner just cued us into this one.
I believe that they did a study.

461
00:22:42,991 --> 00:22:47,991
I'm not 100 percent sure where or when,
but they had a women analyze photos of 

462
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:54,330
different pictures of men doing 
different facial expressions and the men

463
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,910
with scowls and like their chest puffed 
out.

464
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,980
Essentially what you would look at 
somebody and be like,

465
00:22:58,981 --> 00:23:00,090
oh yeah,
that dude's an asshole.

466
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,870
Like right off your perception.
Right?

467
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:06,900
Those got higher ratings in terms of 
good looks than the guys that were 

468
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:10,120
smiling and looked happy signs,
typically chicks,

469
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:16,130
but those studies are all who's.
Who were the people that were in those 

470
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:16,320
studies.
That would make a huge difference.

471
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,380
If it was young people,
older people,

472
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:24,670
I could make a huge difference.
I haven't done a full analysis of this 

473
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:24,670
study yet.
I would want to know.

474
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:28,881
Right?
Like whether it's college kids that are 

475
00:23:28,881 --> 00:23:29,370
young and don't know any better or 
whether it's women in their thirties.

476
00:23:29,371 --> 00:23:32,340
I would like to know like where the drop
off point is with chicks,

477
00:23:32,341 --> 00:23:34,770
get tired of dudes with their chest 
sticking out,

478
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:39,270
you know that for whatever reason might 
be appealing for an 18 year old.

479
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:43,920
I think girls like that in the beginning
and then they end up fucking hating.

480
00:23:43,921 --> 00:23:45,910
It kills zone.
You know what

481
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,740
I mean?
They were attracted to the barbarian and

482
00:23:48,741 --> 00:23:52,710
the fucking wild savage.
But then now they got them that damn,

483
00:23:52,711 --> 00:23:55,700
I wish he wasn't such a fucking savage 
because other bitches like that too.

484
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:57,470
So then they ended up hating that shit.
Right?

485
00:23:58,010 --> 00:23:58,670
Wouldn't,
couldn't be.

486
00:23:58,671 --> 00:24:03,671
Yeah.
But it's okay because that acid is just 

487
00:24:03,671 --> 00:24:03,671
going to move onto another chick.
That's totally okay with that.

488
00:24:03,671 --> 00:24:04,140
So while,
until it wears off,

489
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:08,610
that asshole is not looking to settle 
down with like one chick,

490
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:12,140
you know?
Depends which asshole.

491
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,720
Well you know what I think it is.
I think we're still stuck with the 

492
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,250
echoes of some ancient Dna.
I think we still have,

493
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:24,550
for whatever reason,
we still have all the instincts that 

494
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:27,911
people had back when you had to worry 
about like marauding hordes coming over 

495
00:24:28,071 --> 00:24:30,170
the top of the hill with swords and 
knives,

496
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,240
like you had to be kind of an asshole 
back then,

497
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:37,700
you know,
and you had a fuck more than one chick 

498
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,671
because your kids are all going to get 
killed by arrows and fucking flying 

499
00:24:39,671 --> 00:24:39,671
body.

500
00:24:39,671 --> 00:24:41,570
So that's a good point.
It's a very good point.

501
00:24:41,571 --> 00:24:42,680
If you're living back then,
man,

502
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:47,690
you had tons of DNA spreading mean.
They used to have fertility rituals.

503
00:24:47,901 --> 00:24:49,550
Whether you would hope that people got 
pregnant.

504
00:24:49,551 --> 00:24:52,220
The exact opposite of what we do today 
today.

505
00:24:52,221 --> 00:24:55,350
Everybody's like,
please get her fucking period please.

506
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:59,360
And back then they were.
They had rituals and by the time we were

507
00:24:59,361 --> 00:25:01,970
in our twenties,
in a way before we had kids,

508
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:06,110
those people back in the day like we're 
all our DNA came from.

509
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:09,380
They were on their way out the door.
They not only had kids,

510
00:25:09,381 --> 00:25:14,381
they were getting old and they were 
going to be dead by the time they're in 

511
00:25:14,381 --> 00:25:17,021
their thirties.
It'd probably be killed or disease or 

512
00:25:17,021 --> 00:25:19,220
something so that crazy.
The reason why we're here is because the

513
00:25:19,221 --> 00:25:24,221
same reason why women would like a guy 
that's aggressive or an asshole because 

514
00:25:24,221 --> 00:25:25,010
she thinks that guy could protect her.

515
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:28,840
It's this bizarre fucking trick that 
nature is played on this,

516
00:25:28,841 --> 00:25:33,680
this thousands of years of evolution 
technologically and historically and how

517
00:25:33,681 --> 00:25:36,260
much information we have in the way we 
could communicate with each other.

518
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:41,410
Still doesn't work.
Still doesn't stills in totally stopped 

519
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:41,480
at monkey.
Fuck gene.

520
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:46,720
That's still deep down in the back 
because chicks want some guy who could 

521
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,830
defend the castle.
Is that true,

522
00:25:48,831 --> 00:25:49,740
Garrett?
Thanks.

523
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:53,180
So study.
Study proved that man,

524
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,020
your personal study.
What's not my case study.

525
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:58,530
Now I wish.
I wish.

526
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:01,160
I wish I.
I'm working on becoming more and more of

527
00:26:01,161 --> 00:26:06,161
an asshole.
I'm trying to get better at it and not 

528
00:26:06,161 --> 00:26:08,190
people that have fucking acl 
reconstruction.

529
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,110
Then I'll do my best.
You know,

530
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,610
man,
I'm chasing that dream because I.

531
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:16,070
it's clear that they are more successful
with women.

532
00:26:16,071 --> 00:26:18,190
For sure.
Donna has a wizard that Kai,

533
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,650
he is such an interesting dude.
Such an interesting guy to talk to.

534
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:26,700
Such a smart guy.
I actually don't train there for the 

535
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,931
technique at all.
It's just for the stories that he tells 

536
00:26:28,931 --> 00:26:31,001
us.
And so you were saying before the 

537
00:26:31,001 --> 00:26:33,521
podcast that data her,
you went to Danaher's to get a private 

538
00:26:33,521 --> 00:26:34,460
or something like that at first or train
with them.

539
00:26:34,461 --> 00:26:35,690
And then he,
uh,

540
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:39,740
introduced you to his leg lock system?
Oh,

541
00:26:39,741 --> 00:26:40,400
um,
yeah.

542
00:26:40,401 --> 00:26:43,580
I mean just when we started,
when I started training with John,

543
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:44,320
um,

544
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,040
you know,
first it was just an inconsistent basis,

545
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:48,800
like once a once a week or so,
you know,

546
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:51,480
a lot of MMA fighters come to like a 
Monday afternoon class.

547
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:53,810
So I was going in there and that was 
when I was in college.

548
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:56,310
I didn't have time to go over all the 
time,

549
00:26:56,311 --> 00:27:01,311
but once I started going there 
consistently I got a chance to see like 

550
00:27:01,311 --> 00:27:04,461
kind of the strategies that he teaches 
and leg locks aren't like his main 

551
00:27:04,681 --> 00:27:09,681
focus.
But I think he's made huge innovations 

552
00:27:09,681 --> 00:27:09,681
in the leg lock game to the point where 
like,

553
00:27:09,681 --> 00:27:10,470
you know,
when he teaches it,

554
00:27:10,471 --> 00:27:12,300
it seems like that's like his main 
thing,

555
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,530
you know.
But uh,

556
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:14,250
yeah,
no,

557
00:27:14,251 --> 00:27:16,590
it's definitely went over like our whole
leg lock game.

558
00:27:16,591 --> 00:27:17,700
Me and uh,
you know,

559
00:27:17,701 --> 00:27:19,920
Eddie,
Eddie Cummings.

560
00:27:19,921 --> 00:27:20,760
Yeah.
Um,

561
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:23,160
both of our games just stemmed from that
for sure.

562
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:25,440
You know what I mean?
He's such a smart dude.

563
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:26,130
Yeah.
So,

564
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:28,020
so on the ball about so many things 
about,

565
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,970
you know,
all sorts of different aspects of life.

566
00:27:29,971 --> 00:27:34,971
He's a very interesting perspective.
Somebody recently asked me what was the 

567
00:27:34,971 --> 00:27:37,900
best advice I'd ever been given and I,
I continually preach it.

568
00:27:37,901 --> 00:27:39,360
This is it.
And uh,

569
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:40,050
that,
uh,

570
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,360
John always tells us never to get 
married,

571
00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:46,050
but he lists for four reasons why you 
could possibly get married.

572
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,090
Um,
these are four circumstances,

573
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,050
all of which have to exist.
All right.

574
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,840
Otherwise,
marriage just isn't an option.

575
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:54,210
Okay.
The first all at the same time,

576
00:27:54,211 --> 00:27:55,930
it was for all four.
Otherwise it's.

577
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,480
Yeah.
And then the offers on the table,

578
00:27:57,481 --> 00:27:59,010
it's not like you definitely have to get
married.

579
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,050
It's like,
alright,

580
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:04,020
we understand why,
so the first is that the woman has to be

581
00:28:04,021 --> 00:28:05,820
between the ages of 18 and 25.

582
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:11,360
Okay.
Second is that you have to be over the 

583
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,181
age of 55.
The third is that you have to have no 

584
00:28:14,181 --> 00:28:15,660
money and the fourth is that she has to 
have tons of money.

585
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:21,020
Otherwise it's just not even a question.
Don't get that even in the wheel house.

586
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,150
Oh my God.
That's funny.

587
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:29,360
That is hilarious.
And I think he recently added some 

588
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,570
innovations to that theory with like the
woman has to be an info maniac or 

589
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:35,901
something like that.
He keeps making it harder and harder to 

590
00:28:35,901 --> 00:28:38,541
get married as we as we go along.
I would love to see her debate like an 

591
00:28:38,541 --> 00:28:38,880
angry woman.

592
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,200
It would be.
I'm sure he's done that many,

593
00:28:43,201 --> 00:28:45,000
many times,
but on those points.

594
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:51,420
So he's not married.
I don't see that happening anytime soon.

595
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,230
What's that?
Does he have a girlfriend?

596
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:57,390
We don't know anything about his 
personal life.

597
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,330
He's a superstar you?
No,

598
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,270
no.
Honestly,

599
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,710
even if I.
I don't,

600
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,550
we,
we'd never.

601
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:05,290
We're not the player.
What's that?

602
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:08,100
Would you consider him a player?
I can't answer any questions like that.

603
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:10,370
I don't know.
I just,

604
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,210
I'll tell you,
this is my car guy.

605
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:17,490
You guys think like we're like best 
friends with them because he trained 

606
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:19,871
with him all the time.
We know nothing about this guy as a 

607
00:29:19,871 --> 00:29:19,871
human being,
you know,

608
00:29:19,871 --> 00:29:23,801
like,
just like the little bits of pieces of 

609
00:29:23,801 --> 00:29:23,801
the stories.
We never hang out with them.

610
00:29:23,801 --> 00:29:24,320
None of that stuff.
Like it's a,

611
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:29,370
he's an enigma for sure.
Like what he does once he steps off the 

612
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:29,370
mat,
if he disappears into the ether,

613
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:30,720
as far as I'm concerned,
I have no clue.

614
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:36,020
Let's give a.
He was a philosophy student right when 

615
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:36,020
he started training in Jujitsu.
Yeah.

616
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:36,990
Yeah.
GotTa.

617
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,730
Get him on the podcast.
I was super smart guy.

618
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:40,680
Yeah,
that would be an insane podcast.

619
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:41,590
Yeah,
he'd be great.

620
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:42,250
I would definitely

621
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:43,450
love to have that.
Meanwhile,

622
00:29:43,451 --> 00:29:48,451
Gary,
you're competing tomorrow at the Eddie 

623
00:29:48,451 --> 00:29:48,520
Bravo invitational here in La and it's 
at the orpheum,

624
00:29:48,521 --> 00:29:50,170
the orpheum theater,
downtown La,

625
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:51,310
the orpheum.
Amazing,

626
00:29:51,311 --> 00:29:56,311
amazing place to have startup four doors
and the paper view starts at four.

627
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:00,790
It's going to be on bluedot 
videos.com/Ebi,

628
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:03,160
1499,
and if you,

629
00:30:03,161 --> 00:30:05,250
even if you don't train,
if you're thinking about training,

630
00:30:05,251 --> 00:30:05,940
you've sound like,
ma'am,

631
00:30:05,941 --> 00:30:06,790
I'm neither.
Should do something.

632
00:30:06,791 --> 00:30:09,520
You would watch how fun it is.
Watch how exciting it is.

633
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:13,810
I think that the only reason why Jujitsu
and submission grappling,

634
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:18,870
the way you're doing it on your show was
the only reason why that's not on 

635
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:18,870
television.
It's just people aren't,

636
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:20,830
they're not accustomed to it.
Like you're accustomed to having golf on

637
00:30:20,831 --> 00:30:25,831
TV.
So you sit there and watch golf or 

638
00:30:25,831 --> 00:30:27,871
you're accustomed to having cricket and 
some parts of the world like try 

639
00:30:27,871 --> 00:30:27,871
watching cricket.

640
00:30:27,871 --> 00:30:29,350
You ever been in England?
If the channel and crickets on your.

641
00:30:29,351 --> 00:30:34,351
Like what?
The couple of times just to see if I 

642
00:30:34,351 --> 00:30:34,420
could figure it out by watching it and 
I'm like Nope,

643
00:30:34,421 --> 00:30:37,030
I don't know why they keep running.
John told us that way.

644
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,170
Cool.
History about cricket.

645
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:42,330
They used to be a a guy that was known,
so at first they were only throwing like

646
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,240
70 mile an hour pitches and they started
to increase it up to like,

647
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:48,280
you know,
in the nineties and the 100 mile an hour

648
00:30:48,281 --> 00:30:52,270
pitch range and a cricket.
You're allowed to purposefully throw the

649
00:30:52,271 --> 00:30:57,271
ball at the person that's bagging.
So these guys would just wail people 

650
00:30:57,271 --> 00:31:01,350
like in the face and they were just 
known for that became famous for just 

651
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:04,231
smashing people in the face.
How does that benefit you if you're 

652
00:31:04,231 --> 00:31:04,231
hitting the.
What's that?

653
00:31:04,231 --> 00:31:04,231
How does that.

654
00:31:04,231 --> 00:31:05,470
How is that good?
I guess?

655
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,750
I guess if you hit the guy and like,
you know,

656
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,760
fuck them up enough,
it's going to be hard for him to hit the

657
00:31:09,761 --> 00:31:14,620
ball and hitting the knock them out.
I don't know how that works,

658
00:31:14,621 --> 00:31:19,621
man.
The guy hitting the ball have all the 

659
00:31:19,621 --> 00:31:19,621
gear on who has the gear.
Yeah.

660
00:31:19,621 --> 00:31:21,460
They see this is back when they didn't 
even really have that much gear to where

661
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:24,190
they weren't even allowed to wear 
helmets or anything like that.

662
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:25,430
No,
no.

663
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:30,450
Here's the question.
Why would you not try to hit the guy 

664
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:30,570
every fucking time?
I think that.

665
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,840
I think that's.
I was trying to do.

666
00:31:31,841 --> 00:31:36,841
I think that's why you have a giant wide
paddle for a defensive tool that it 

667
00:31:36,841 --> 00:31:40,490
affects a tool that's in that 
circumstance aim for the head every time

668
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:45,570
you think it was like that paddle work 
better back when people were only 

669
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,150
throwing like 60,
70 miles an hour.

670
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:51,450
But now they're like majorly pitch.
You ever seen the guy throw a fast ball 

671
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:53,200
like a major league fastball?
It's Kinda terrifying me.

672
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,730
It's insane.
I've seen it live.

673
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:57,640
It's Kinda terrifying.
This speed at God can throw a ball.

674
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:59,270
It's Kinda like,
like Eagle.

675
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:00,640
Whoa.
Look at that swing.

676
00:32:00,641 --> 00:32:01,290
It's,
it's,

677
00:32:01,291 --> 00:32:03,610
you're guessing.
It's like in that area.

678
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:06,010
Yeah.
Well you're hoping that he's aiming for,

679
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:07,970
you know what I mean?
Specifically your area.

680
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:12,670
So who was the guy that died and then 
they started instituting those helmets.

681
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:15,190
He's a,
it was a famous baseball player.

682
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:17,770
He got hit and the owe me might not have
died.

683
00:32:17,771 --> 00:32:19,460
He might've gotten like really fucked 
up.

684
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:22,540
It was never the same again.
But I believe he played for the Red Sox,

685
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:27,900
but it was when I was a kid,
it's kind of got hit with a ball and it 

686
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:28,630
really fucked up and his career was 
done.

687
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:30,760
It was never the same again.
I remember thinking,

688
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:33,280
man,
like one ball can do that.

689
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:37,090
You can get hit with one ball and you're
done with the fuck.

690
00:32:37,091 --> 00:32:39,680
Was that your last name?
Hayward.

691
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:40,850
I don't know.
It was,

692
00:32:40,851 --> 00:32:41,300
uh,
it was,

693
00:32:41,301 --> 00:32:42,650
uh,
it was a famous case.

694
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,890
Wade.
Bob died late nights.

695
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,910
Different guy.
He died later.

696
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,210
Fuck,
you know,

697
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:51,590
this is probably some sports fans right 
now.

698
00:32:51,591 --> 00:32:53,840
Screen when you got the whole fucking 
story wrong.

699
00:32:53,841 --> 00:32:57,760
Faggot.
You've got the whole June.

700
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:02,570
Even the white grease ball.
My point being,

701
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:06,980
if Jujitsu is on TV,
if they got to see some wild matches,

702
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:10,040
especially one of the things I 
appreciate about watching your match,

703
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:14,410
I got exposed to you by Eddie.
The first one I saw was you and chrome.

704
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:16,540
Yes.
We talked about.

705
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,740
We talked about it.
That was an exciting match.

706
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:24,720
Whoa.
That was two dudes to do like,

707
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:29,100
just razor sharp assassins trying to 
chop each other down.

708
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:30,720
Man,
what a match.

709
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,520
Just what a match.
That was incredible.

710
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:33,150
You know,

711
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:36,180
the first time I met you was at that 
seminar,

712
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:41,181
right.
And in Florida for you at that seminar 

713
00:33:41,181 --> 00:33:41,181
in Florida,
Florida.

714
00:33:41,181 --> 00:33:41,181
No.
It thing.

715
00:33:41,181 --> 00:33:42,400
So we,
you know.

716
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:47,710
Well,
what ended up happening was the reason 

717
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:49,280
why he did Ebi one was originally I was 
going to do the sub only worlds that,

718
00:33:49,281 --> 00:33:50,730
that was going to sw.
Oh,

719
00:33:50,731 --> 00:33:53,550
that's what it was going to be.
And Scotty from on the Mat,

720
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:56,190
he,
he knew he was on board.

721
00:33:56,191 --> 00:33:56,610
He goes,
dude,

722
00:33:56,611 --> 00:33:57,660
that's a great idea.
Let's do it.

723
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,130
Me maybe a sponsor.
And he goes,

724
00:33:59,131 --> 00:34:04,131
but can I get my boy Gary Tonin in there
for sure because we were going to do a 

725
00:34:04,131 --> 00:34:04,131
one slash 70,
the first one.

726
00:34:04,131 --> 00:34:06,420
Sub only world one 70,
60 man bragging.

727
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,550
And I didn't even,
I hadn't even heard of you.

728
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:10,280
How do you keep.
I don't keep track of,

729
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:11,670
of the top Jiu Jitsu guys.

730
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:13,320
I really don't.
I don't know about it either.

731
00:34:13,321 --> 00:34:13,780
So,
um,

732
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,800
I can barely keep track of the guys in 
the UFC.

733
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,050
And he said,
I got to get Gary Toner and I go,

734
00:34:19,051 --> 00:34:24,051
well,
what I'm trying to do is get the best 

735
00:34:24,051 --> 00:34:24,051
submission guys.
I'm not,

736
00:34:24,051 --> 00:34:25,680
I don't care about the best ib jj of 
points guys.

737
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:30,830
I don't want points guys.
I want submission guys because he's 

738
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:30,830
good.
I go,

739
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:30,830
okay.
You sure?

740
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:34,310
Okay.
Like I was going to put him in as a 

741
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:34,310
favor.
I never even,

742
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:35,580
I didn't know this guy.
So sub only worlds.

743
00:34:35,581 --> 00:34:40,581
We had investors interested and then it 
fell through and then by the time I was 

744
00:34:40,581 --> 00:34:44,880
ready to start pushing it again,
I decided a victor got involved.

745
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:47,450
Victor Dobby loud from the UFC.
He's a Spanish commentators,

746
00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:49,050
systematic Joe Rogan.
He got them all said,

747
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,500
let me be the unvested let me produce 
it.

748
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:54,720
And it's called Eddie Bravo.
Invitational.

749
00:34:54,721 --> 00:34:55,800
So.
And I thought,

750
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:56,820
hmm.
And he gets,

751
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:00,910
he wanted to her to call it that for a 
recognition he doesn't do.

752
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:03,600
People would know right away.
And it was his idea.

753
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:06,240
Ebi was his idea.
I was like calling up my name,

754
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:11,600
are you sure?
But then as you think with a business 

755
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:11,600
mind,
you think,

756
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:11,970
okay,
that is a good idea.

757
00:35:11,971 --> 00:35:13,200
Let me put myself out there.
And,

758
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,420
and I was uh,
you know,

759
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:15,180
uh,
we were gonna do,

760
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:17,550
Metamorris was already in the works and 
it'll be perfect.

761
00:35:17,551 --> 00:35:19,440
My name would be back.
We can boom,

762
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,840
we could piggyback off that,
you know,

763
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:24,450
so I thought it was a good strategy.
It's a great strategy.

764
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:27,240
I have a well established name already 
to try and build up something else.

765
00:35:27,241 --> 00:35:32,241
So much harder.
So the very first one we did one 70 and 

766
00:35:32,241 --> 00:35:32,460
we did the featherweights too.

767
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:35,310
We're doing UFC weights and Gary,
of course,

768
00:35:35,311 --> 00:35:40,311
you know,
he was going to be in sub only Scotty 

769
00:35:40,311 --> 00:35:40,311
from under.
Matt was involved in.

770
00:35:40,311 --> 00:35:40,311
He said,
my boy,

771
00:35:40,311 --> 00:35:41,130
Gary,
you've got to put them in.

772
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,640
And by that time I,
I,

773
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:46,530
I bjj,
Kuma Tay was out and I remembered who he

774
00:35:46,531 --> 00:35:51,531
was.
That was the guy that was Scotty 

775
00:35:51,531 --> 00:35:53,190
Nelson's boy.
So then went to Abu Dhabi 2013.

776
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:57,030
And um,
I remember the first time we met there,

777
00:35:57,031 --> 00:36:02,031
we were at the hotel lobby and I still 
didn't know you were just like,

778
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:03,660
hey guys,
I didn't even know it was like,

779
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:06,180
Oh shit.
And then he goes on.

780
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:11,580
It was one of the greatest Abu Dhabi,
even though you didn't get the gold 

781
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:14,871
medal,
it was one of the greatest performances 

782
00:36:14,871 --> 00:36:14,880
because that fight with chrome was 
absolutely incredible.

783
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,760
And then after that,
after you almost pulled it off,

784
00:36:17,761 --> 00:36:18,980
but he ended up finishing it.

785
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:24,030
That's what made it crazy to,
that's tricks and Sun and Hickson's 

786
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:27,501
coaching.
But after that you did the absolute 175 

787
00:36:27,501 --> 00:36:28,470
pounds you want against Blue Shesha in 
Cyborg.

788
00:36:28,471 --> 00:36:31,620
And those guys couldn't tap you.
You were going after them.

789
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:33,420
I mean,
Jesus Christ,

790
00:36:33,421 --> 00:36:35,770
this is the guy that just almost look at
them in the absolute,

791
00:36:35,771 --> 00:36:38,160
the smallest dude in the absolute.
He gets the biggest.

792
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:41,220
He gets the two champions,
Cyborg one,

793
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:43,370
a,
the absolute ambush.

794
00:36:43,371 --> 00:36:47,880
Esha won the heavyweight class.
So they fought twice in the finals.

795
00:36:47,881 --> 00:36:48,750
One time.
Boucher,

796
00:36:48,751 --> 00:36:49,960
one,
one time cyborg wearing.

797
00:36:49,961 --> 00:36:53,250
So that's crazy in itself.
But he went against both of them.

798
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:59,600
God Damn sideboards.
Giant man.

799
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:02,970
Like it has to be like 2:30
plus at least.

800
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:08,030
Yeah.
When he was doing the metamorris match 

801
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:08,030
with sharp,
I was like,

802
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:08,850
this guy's sick.
He's really strong.

803
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:10,830
Super technical,
really good off his back,

804
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,570
and then boom,
after that we're like,

805
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:13,620
Holy Shit.

806
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:15,990
He's got some ridiculous guard.
What do you call it?

807
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:17,100
Tornado.
Tornado,

808
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:19,290
garden.
I've seen them in videos.

809
00:37:19,291 --> 00:37:21,030
It's a tornado guard.
Is that what it's called?

810
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,820
Especially with the gies.
Amazing.

811
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:25,470
He's.
He's one of the bigger guys that started

812
00:37:25,471 --> 00:37:30,471
to.
Started to be moved like a lighter guy 

813
00:37:30,471 --> 00:37:32,781
when it comes to Jujitsu,
used to just be like two big fat is 

814
00:37:32,781 --> 00:37:34,920
falling all over each other in the head.
Guy For dude over to 30.

815
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,980
There's nobody that has.
I haven't seen.

816
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:41,990
I mean,
as far as I'm sure there's guys and in 

817
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:42,690
Sao Paolo somewhere that are,
they're just as good.

818
00:37:42,691 --> 00:37:44,310
I don't,
I don't have my finger on all that.

819
00:37:44,311 --> 00:37:46,260
But what I've seen out of the famous 
guys,

820
00:37:46,261 --> 00:37:48,720
Cyborg is a big dude.
Nobody move.

821
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:51,330
I don't see anybody moving my camera,
his half guard.

822
00:37:51,331 --> 00:37:52,930
It's insane.
I can't even play as hell.

823
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:57,980
I'm like,
that's a whole different kind of half 

824
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:57,980
guard.

825
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,930
I'm trying.
I've got a couple of students that are 

826
00:37:59,930 --> 00:37:59,930
on the case.
I'm like,

827
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:02,630
go study him.
We're going to eventually bring that 

828
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:02,630
shit and that's on the table because 
it's working at a high level.

829
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:05,420
He gets under dudes and with his 
hamstrings fucking launches.

830
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:10,950
It's crazy.
We should call him by his name because 

831
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:13,851
everybody thinks cyborgs.
The chicken fights for our brand 

832
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:18,320
Jujitsu,
Cyborg,

833
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,100
Cyborg,
Jujitsu.

834
00:38:20,101 --> 00:38:25,101
Cyborg is super yoga and there's a lot 
of great videos of him doing strength 

835
00:38:25,101 --> 00:38:29,310
and conditioning work online to that 
motherfucker is stupid strong,

836
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:33,350
and there's another Cyborg that does 
Jujitsu and MMA to what?

837
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:35,030
Yes.
This is smiling cyber.

838
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,190
That's the guy that Nick Diaz aren't

839
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:39,300
to remember that that guy.
Sideboard tips,

840
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:39,790
right?
Well,

841
00:38:39,791 --> 00:38:41,380
that cyborgs husband.
Yeah,

842
00:38:41,381 --> 00:38:42,430
that's right.
Yeah.

843
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:43,690
Ex husband.
Yeah.

844
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:44,820
Yeah.
There's a bunch.

845
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:49,050
Of course.
And bottom line is gary went to.

846
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,600
I got to watch that fight again because 
I mean they could.

847
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:57,630
They were so frustrated.
These giant superstar legends are 

848
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:59,170
already living legend.
Both of them already.

849
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:03,940
Just he's a fucking animal and he 
couldn't tap them is crazy.

850
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:07,400
Did you know about cyborgs guard?
Like,

851
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:08,860
did you understand it?
My,

852
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:09,670
my,
uh,

853
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,590
teacher Tom the blast and my original 
teacher,

854
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:12,900
um,
uh,

855
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:17,890
he fought him in Abu Dhabi in 2009,
2011,

856
00:39:17,891 --> 00:39:19,470
something like that.
I guess where was,

857
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:24,220
which one was in Barcelona a doesn't 
matter,

858
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:25,620
but anyway,
he thought of it.

859
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:26,230
Um,
so,

860
00:39:26,231 --> 00:39:31,231
you know,
I did a little studying on him just 

861
00:39:31,231 --> 00:39:31,231
because,
uh,

862
00:39:31,231 --> 00:39:31,231
you know,
uh,

863
00:39:31,231 --> 00:39:31,231
my,
my teacher,

864
00:39:31,231 --> 00:39:32,770
we fought them and that it was a very 
controversial match,

865
00:39:32,771 --> 00:39:34,590
like kind of,
uh,

866
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:37,180
when you look back at it,
it looks like they kind of screwed Tom.

867
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,430
So,
um,

868
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,580
you know,
that for me,

869
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,990
like I definitely was familiar with 
them.

870
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:43,240
I watched videos of him and stuff like 
that after that.

871
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,600
But I'd say he'd made leaps and bounds 
from that point.

872
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:47,300
Uh,
you know,

873
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:48,820
I really,
I didn't,

874
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:52,030
I took his Jujitsu a little bit for 
granted before that fight.

875
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:54,860
He in that Abu Dhabi,
uh,

876
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:57,730
you did.
So I felt like it was like the biggest,

877
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:00,370
uh,
like a climax of his career for sure.

878
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:02,170
In terms of his technique.
It was,

879
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:05,080
it was on that if that event for sure.
Two trains hard.

880
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:06,520
Yeah man,
definitely trends heart.

881
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,270
That's interesting.
Um,

882
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:10,930
when you,
when you see a guy like that and you see

883
00:40:10,931 --> 00:40:12,910
like those,
those leaps and bounds,

884
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:14,350
what,
what do you attribute that do?

885
00:40:14,351 --> 00:40:16,930
Do you attribute that to like the high 
level Jujitsu that's available today?

886
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,220
Everybody has to kind of keep up.

887
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:21,270
What do you attribute it to?
Just I'm just like people.

888
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:23,200
I think overall people getting better,
right?

889
00:40:23,201 --> 00:40:24,340
We all admit that,
right?

890
00:40:24,341 --> 00:40:27,040
Yeah.
I mean you guys have today are about,

891
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:29,200
there's guys that stand out in my mind,
you know,

892
00:40:29,201 --> 00:40:34,201
it's always going to be more so Garcia 
in Hickson in his prime and so he's 

893
00:40:34,201 --> 00:40:34,870
going be these guys that stand out,
but the guys that today it seems like if

894
00:40:34,871 --> 00:40:39,871
you're,
if you wanted to get into Jujitsu and 

895
00:40:39,871 --> 00:40:39,871
watched submission grappling like the 
Ebi tomorrow,

896
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:40,630
it's just.
No,

897
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:45,720
no better time.
Like if people are finishing people now 

898
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,200
and every day I got a bunch of Jujitsu 
nerds and my association and my 

899
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:48,340
homeschool,
they're just,

900
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:53,670
every time I see a cool clip,
every time I see a cool clip of a new 

901
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:54,730
transition that Jeff Glover put on it,
you know,

902
00:40:54,731 --> 00:40:57,830
on instagram or whatever,
I'll tell my little Jujitsu,

903
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,410
Gina says,
you see that one new,

904
00:40:59,411 --> 00:41:00,610
a half guard sweep seen it.

905
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:06,120
Like everyone just seem to come up with 
new shit shit that I saw in a video and 

906
00:41:07,541 --> 00:41:10,240
I thought I might going to teach us 
tonight and uh Oh,

907
00:41:10,241 --> 00:41:15,241
you're doing it wrong.
And I've seen that video a thousand 

908
00:41:15,241 --> 00:41:17,851
times and that was the only one that was
going to give us steel and move.

909
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:20,380
Well,
that's a beautiful thing about Jujitsu.

910
00:41:20,381 --> 00:41:23,200
That's misunderstood.
A lot of people think that it's a,

911
00:41:23,201 --> 00:41:27,400
it has to do with strength and 
aggression and think of it as being like

912
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:30,550
this thing.
But so many of the guys that do it,

913
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:35,640
they are like,
if they weren't doing this would be 

914
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,680
building computers or something.
We talk about it all the time.

915
00:41:36,681 --> 00:41:41,681
It's crazy how we could actually 
dedicate this time to something that 

916
00:41:41,681 --> 00:41:43,820
people actually care about and we could 
actually make money or something,

917
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:44,990
you know,
so,

918
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,430
um,
but yeah,

919
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:48,410
that's definitely more of the mindset 
for most of them.

920
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,440
There are those,
you know,

921
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:52,250
muscle head kept guys.
There's a few of those for sure.

922
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,680
But guys like you,
the thoughtful,

923
00:41:54,681 --> 00:41:56,840
intelligent guys seem to always rise to 
the top.

924
00:41:56,841 --> 00:42:01,841
They figure out how to always have the 
best answer to whatever problems in 

925
00:42:02,541 --> 00:42:03,170
front of them.
Yeah,

926
00:42:03,171 --> 00:42:04,750
that's what we're really looking for.
I mean,

927
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:08,100
that's the theory that I try to pass on 
to my students and stuff.

928
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,230
Um,
you know,

929
00:42:09,231 --> 00:42:11,540
as opposed to like I tell it at seminars
all the time.

930
00:42:11,541 --> 00:42:12,440
I'm like,
guys,

931
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,720
if you're ever doing a move and you're 
just like,

932
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:20,080
this isn't working,
the reasons probably not because you're 

933
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:20,080
not pushing harder or you need to go 
faster,

934
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:25,030
you know what I mean?
Like that's not the reason something's 

935
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:25,030
not working.
It's because your techniques flawed,

936
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:25,610
you know,
you're doing it for his defense is good.

937
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:27,140
Yeah.
Either or.

938
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,190
Yeah,
there's a lot.

939
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:30,230
That's one of those things that,
oh,

940
00:42:30,231 --> 00:42:34,220
I always used to like laugh when people 
would talk about it.

941
00:42:34,221 --> 00:42:36,770
When it comes to a complicated 
techniques,

942
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:38,420
like some of you are rubber guard 
techniques,

943
00:42:38,421 --> 00:42:41,990
that takes a long time to get flexible 
and you have to do the reps to pull them

944
00:42:41,991 --> 00:42:43,640
off and people would say,
oh,

945
00:42:43,641 --> 00:42:44,810
that's.
That doesn't work,

946
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,400
and we would always laugh like,
okay,

947
00:42:46,401 --> 00:42:50,150
dad kicks work,
learn how to do a head kick right away.

948
00:42:50,290 --> 00:42:52,300
Like this is a perfect example,
right?

949
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:54,170
Like head kicks,
like a wheel kick to the head.

950
00:42:54,171 --> 00:42:56,720
How long is that going to take someone 
out?

951
00:42:56,860 --> 00:43:01,860
You can't say it doesn't work.
Watch the two or rockhold 5 million 

952
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:02,240
fights.
Now there's a lot of them.

953
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:07,100
So in a lot of ways Jujitsu is is like 
everything else,

954
00:43:07,101 --> 00:43:12,101
right?
There's going to be these levels that 

955
00:43:12,101 --> 00:43:12,101
you see of it that are super high and 
then you realize what's possible and you

956
00:43:12,101 --> 00:43:12,710
go,
oh,

957
00:43:12,711 --> 00:43:17,711
and then along the way you got a lot of 
people are second guessing a lot of 

958
00:43:17,711 --> 00:43:17,711
doubters.

959
00:43:17,711 --> 00:43:18,500
A lot of people that don't think this is
going to work or that's going to work,

960
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,730
there's just so many moves in Jiu Jitsu.
It's unlike any other sport.

961
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:25,160
It's endless.
Ever.

962
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:28,670
All the top guys have their own style.
There's so much to learn in.

963
00:43:28,671 --> 00:43:33,671
The only way to get good at certain 
transition or move is to spend a lot of 

964
00:43:33,671 --> 00:43:35,300
time with that certain move or that 
transition.

965
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:38,120
You don't have that much time,
so the smart thing to do,

966
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:43,300
it's because sometimes you're working on
a transition that might not pan out and 

967
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:43,430
you hit it a dead end.
So you're like,

968
00:43:43,431 --> 00:43:48,431
dude,
you don't know what moves to spend this 

969
00:43:48,431 --> 00:43:48,431
precious time with.
So you look at the pop guys and what are

970
00:43:48,431 --> 00:43:53,411
they doing?
They already done the research and 

971
00:43:53,411 --> 00:43:56,081
development at works,
so now you know what safe to put reps 

972
00:43:56,081 --> 00:43:56,081
into one.

973
00:43:56,081 --> 00:43:58,880
That's a safe one and the safe ones are 
the best ones.

974
00:43:58,881 --> 00:44:01,310
Right.
I think the compliment to that though is

975
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:03,470
like,
so you look at that and I seen,

976
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:05,780
I've seen people do it.
People that used to be on our team,

977
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:11,070
it would look at these guys,
what are the top guys do and focus on 

978
00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:11,070
that,
but you focus too much on it.

979
00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:13,520
Those top guys like let's take like the 
Menendez brothers for instance.

980
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:14,900
All right.
With like Baron Bolo,

981
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:15,350
right?
Yeah.

982
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,810
Okay.
These guys are doing a move that they've

983
00:44:17,811 --> 00:44:18,710
perfected,
right?

984
00:44:18,711 --> 00:44:21,020
Yes.
So sure I could study what they're doing

985
00:44:21,021 --> 00:44:23,420
and learn what they're doing,
but am I going to be able to make.

986
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:27,470
Am I going to be able to make the same 
headway that they have with that move?

987
00:44:27,471 --> 00:44:32,471
Probably not.
So I probably need to pick up a 

988
00:44:32,471 --> 00:44:32,471
different facet of my game and headway 
with that move.

989
00:44:32,471 --> 00:44:33,870
You know what I mean?
Then that's what I try to do.

990
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:35,100
You know,
that that's what I tell people that,

991
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:35,580
oh,
you know,

992
00:44:35,581 --> 00:44:37,000
what's the best way to get,
you know,

993
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:42,110
a step forward in competition,
a step ahead of the game and I think 

994
00:44:42,110 --> 00:44:45,651
it's being somewhere being in a position
more than other people are in that 

995
00:44:45,651 --> 00:44:49,550
position and developing that not so much
what you see other people doing.

996
00:44:49,570 --> 00:44:52,170
If you're constantly just trying to do 
what other people are doing,

997
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:57,320
you're going to get caught up in that 
game and they'll always find a way to 

998
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:57,320
submit you because they've been doing it
longer.

999
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:01,640
You know what I mean?
I think that's the like the opposing 

1000
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:02,610
strategy to what you were just talking 
about because I totally agree with you.

1001
00:45:02,611 --> 00:45:03,300
I.
I have.

1002
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:08,510
I use both strategies.
I always promote and push to keep your 

1003
00:45:09,241 --> 00:45:12,590
goto moves polished and not forget about
your goat tools.

1004
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:15,420
Those are your special moves.
Anytime a new student comes,

1005
00:45:15,590 --> 00:45:18,960
a a new student comes to me and they see
them developing a move.

1006
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:21,000
Even if it's a move that I suck and I'm 
like,

1007
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:22,500
that's your move right there.
I remind them,

1008
00:45:22,501 --> 00:45:23,550
I go,
that's yours.

1009
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:25,440
Get really good at that.
That's your secret weapon.

1010
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:29,100
You got to have secret weapons,
but at the same time I have new students

1011
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:34,101
starting every day,
so I like to expose them to everything 

1012
00:45:34,101 --> 00:45:35,940
that's working out there and create 
their own style.

1013
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:39,750
Even though personally I teach the baron
bullets part of our warmup system.

1014
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,780
I'm not ever going to be a bar polo 
player.

1015
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:47,990
I messed with it every now and then when
I'm rolling with a 12 year olds and 

1016
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:50,460
women,
all the shit out of a white belt girl.

1017
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:51,990
I'll do that.
I know,

1018
00:45:51,991 --> 00:45:56,790
but I know eventually eventually I'm 
going to get really good at that in like

1019
00:45:56,791 --> 00:45:59,280
10 years and then they'll be able to 
attack with it,

1020
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:04,400
but right now you stick to your Goto,
keep those strong and take your go tos 

1021
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:08,571
to the highest level but also also have 
a constant introduction of new stuff in 

1022
00:46:09,961 --> 00:46:10,360
your game.

1023
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:13,380
It'll pay back later,
maybe 10 years down the road,

1024
00:46:13,590 --> 00:46:16,320
15 years down the road where maybe it's 
not your game now,

1025
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:18,780
but it will be after the light,
like I'm killing it.

1026
00:46:18,781 --> 00:46:23,781
You definitely need to take all those 
elements from the good guys for what 

1027
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:26,181
they do for sure.
And it's really no other martial art 

1028
00:46:26,181 --> 00:46:26,181
like that.
Right.

1029
00:46:26,181 --> 00:46:26,730
That has so many different moves too.
There's just.

1030
00:46:26,731 --> 00:46:31,731
It's incredible.
It's like a five dimensional martial 

1031
00:46:31,731 --> 00:46:31,731
art.
It's.

1032
00:46:31,731 --> 00:46:35,160
Yeah.
I mean it just keeps getting better and 

1033
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:35,160
better at over the years.
Like Joe was saying before,

1034
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:39,280
you know,
the progression of Jujitsu in general 

1035
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:42,351
and the level of it is just going up and
up and I think the biggest innovations 

1036
00:46:42,351 --> 00:46:45,501
that are happening now are probably in 
the leg lock game frontier for you and 

1037
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:50,010
Eddie and Eddie come into a big part of 
that big part of that.

1038
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,350
Since they want a 10 plan,
they want.

1039
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:56,400
We have never outlawed a heel hooks or 
reaping.

1040
00:46:56,700 --> 00:47:01,700
I just never wanted to get heavy on heel
hooks because I want her to train my 

1041
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:06,381
fighters for MMA.
I don't want them to the first habit to 

1042
00:47:06,381 --> 00:47:07,230
go to heal hooks because it's a little 
dangerous when the highest nine guys are

1043
00:47:07,231 --> 00:47:10,170
telling me when my leg lock school guys 
are telling me,

1044
00:47:10,171 --> 00:47:11,280
manny,
Carl,

1045
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:13,200
caren.
Oh Bro,

1046
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:14,780
bro.
MMA leg logs,

1047
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:19,800
last resort.
You don't want to give a position when 

1048
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:19,800
they're saying that.
I'm like,

1049
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:19,800
okay.
But I never discouraged it,

1050
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:20,970
but I had leg lock,
like [inaudible],

1051
00:47:21,090 --> 00:47:23,010
one of my black belts.
Very good at leg locks.

1052
00:47:23,011 --> 00:47:25,950
Denny got really good at.
Like I told denegall five years ago,

1053
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:28,230
submerse yourself in leg locks.
I want.

1054
00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:29,800
He's not going to do mma.
I go,

1055
00:47:29,801 --> 00:47:30,100
so

1056
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,230
leg locks are very important for you.
Uh,

1057
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:34,930
but then when we saw what you did in 
Ebi,

1058
00:47:34,970 --> 00:47:39,520
one leg lock the shit out of everybody.
And then in the grapplers quest,

1059
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:42,550
ultimate absolute in the Obi wan and the
finals,

1060
00:47:42,551 --> 00:47:45,010
you beat Richie Martinez,
one of my guys,

1061
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:46,510
you heal,
hook them inside hook.

1062
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:48,730
And then at the grapplers quest,
ultimate,

1063
00:47:48,731 --> 00:47:53,731
absolute,
or ultimate whatever submission only I 

1064
00:47:53,731 --> 00:47:55,120
get those mixed up.
It was you and Nathan Orchard at the end

1065
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:57,310
of that 16 man,
another one of my black belts.

1066
00:47:57,490 --> 00:47:59,350
And you've got them with the inside.
He'll hook again.

1067
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:01,600
From that point,
Nathan decided,

1068
00:48:01,601 --> 00:48:06,601
you know what?
He started studying everything you were 

1069
00:48:06,601 --> 00:48:08,671
doing and we to me,
I never got deep into my.

1070
00:48:09,770 --> 00:48:14,770
I got a good crippler or a game over 
whatever people call both legs reaped.

1071
00:48:15,041 --> 00:48:17,620
I got when I escaped the mountain,
I go to that.

1072
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:18,430
I'm good at that.

1073
00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:23,430
He'll hook,
but generally I'm not good at heel 

1074
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:23,430
hooks.
Never really looked into it.

1075
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:27,720
I didn't know the system.
I didn't know the system until Nathan 

1076
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:31,570
studied your personal game and then 
showed it to me and I'm like,

1077
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:36,660
wow,
it's like rubber guard because people 

1078
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:39,151
don't.
People think like rubber guard is just 

1079
00:48:39,151 --> 00:48:39,151
reaching up and grabbing your legs and 
hold on and throwing up an arm bar.

1080
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:42,220
They don't realize there's our system.
There's all these positions as a path.

1081
00:48:42,490 --> 00:48:47,490
I didn't realize it was this exact same 
thing for when I first started training 

1082
00:48:47,490 --> 00:48:47,490
leg locks.
I like,

1083
00:48:47,490 --> 00:48:49,660
I walked in like Eddie had already done 
a lot of,

1084
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:54,680
you know,
made a lot of headway in the leg lock 

1085
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:54,680
game and obviously,
you know,

1086
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:54,680
John had been teaching him so,
you know,

1087
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:00,000
when I first came in,
my intentions were always preparing for 

1088
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:00,000
ADCC.
It's,

1089
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:00,000
my intentions were like,
all right,

1090
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,250
I want to know a little bit about this 
leg lock game.

1091
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:03,970
I'm going to be competing in a 
tournament where he looks her legal,

1092
00:49:03,971 --> 00:49:05,620
which I don't usually do.
You know,

1093
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:06,850
I want to be ready for this.
You know,

1094
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:08,710
we're ready for whatever people are 
gonna throw me.

1095
00:49:08,711 --> 00:49:13,711
I'm just going to learn how to do it 
well enough that I can defend it and 

1096
00:49:13,711 --> 00:49:16,440
then I learned that it's like a whole 
different martial art just like walks in

1097
00:49:16,441 --> 00:49:17,440
and I'm like,
what the fuck?

1098
00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:22,710
I'm like,
I wanted to ask John because I'm so 

1099
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:22,710
frustrated I'm not passing Eddie's guard
because just keeps blocking me.

1100
00:49:22,870 --> 00:49:24,130
And I'm like,
so you know,

1101
00:49:24,131 --> 00:49:25,990
when a guy's good at lego logs,
how do you pass the guard?

1102
00:49:25,991 --> 00:49:27,730
He's like,
fucking learning logs dude.

1103
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:33,480
See you got to learn how to,
how to do what he's doing so that you 

1104
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:33,480
know,
the counters and everything.

1105
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:35,260
So I realized I had to spend time on it,
you know,

1106
00:49:35,261 --> 00:49:37,720
as opposed to just dismissing it as like
a small part.

1107
00:49:37,930 --> 00:49:42,930
When you see someone,
when you see someone dismiss them in 

1108
00:49:42,930 --> 00:49:45,121
mma,
like the highest armed guy saying don't 

1109
00:49:45,121 --> 00:49:47,221
do it because it's last resort,
but then you see a guy like I was gonna 

1110
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:49,380
say that one you guys about.
What do you think?

1111
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,580
Like blocks today,
leg locks in mma.

1112
00:49:51,581 --> 00:49:53,410
What do you think?
I just think there needs to be.

1113
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:56,350
There's a few guys that are using them 
well and I just,

1114
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:57,380
I think that,
uh,

1115
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:00,190
you know,
there's just not enough people out there

1116
00:50:00,191 --> 00:50:05,191
that are confident enough in them have 
I've done enough technical research to 

1117
00:50:05,191 --> 00:50:05,200
make them useful,
you know what I mean?

1118
00:50:05,201 --> 00:50:07,090
If you teach one dude is shitty healed.
Yeah,

1119
00:50:07,091 --> 00:50:12,091
absolutely.
But what do you think about as far as 

1120
00:50:12,091 --> 00:50:12,091
specifically?
So it's terrifying.

1121
00:50:12,091 --> 00:50:14,290
The guy knows that he has a confidence 
in his heel,

1122
00:50:14,330 --> 00:50:19,330
hooking nosy can break a limb with it 
and he finds in every different 

1123
00:50:19,330 --> 00:50:20,260
situation.
Most of our transitions we get from,

1124
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:21,010
you know,
oh,

1125
00:50:21,011 --> 00:50:23,050
Pahara got a leg there.
He got to like here,

1126
00:50:23,051 --> 00:50:28,051
you know,
he learns how to get there from many 

1127
00:50:28,051 --> 00:50:28,051
different positions and that's what I 
was talking about and kind of what Eddie

1128
00:50:28,051 --> 00:50:28,051
was

1129
00:50:28,051 --> 00:50:30,260
talking about with finding that thing 
that's like yours,

1130
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:31,730
you know,
he's there all the time.

1131
00:50:31,731 --> 00:50:33,680
So if he can get you there,
boom,

1132
00:50:33,681 --> 00:50:34,320
you're done.
You know,

1133
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:35,940
you don't know what you're doing.
Exactly.

1134
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:38,090
You're thinking he's already moved on 
instance.

1135
00:50:38,350 --> 00:50:40,470
This is what I'm thinking about.
Leg locks is a,

1136
00:50:40,490 --> 00:50:42,300
I hear this stuff from highest on,
you know,

1137
00:50:42,301 --> 00:50:43,700
10 years ago.
Yeah.

1138
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:46,220
I hear my,
one of my purse,

1139
00:50:46,270 --> 00:50:49,680
my first MMA fighter was,
he was rubber guard twister.

1140
00:50:49,681 --> 00:50:50,570
He lives like,
uh,

1141
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:52,670
like I,
I created this guy,

1142
00:50:52,671 --> 00:50:57,671
but he also had a leg lock out any did 
MMA and every time he tried to go for 

1143
00:50:57,671 --> 00:50:58,300
leg locks he got knocked out.
Yeah.

1144
00:50:58,550 --> 00:50:59,970
So that came.
There was a,

1145
00:51:00,010 --> 00:51:02,210
there was a point where uh,
he had to.

1146
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:03,710
It was too dangerous.
Yeah,

1147
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:04,770
after like 12,
five.

1148
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:06,630
But then,
um,

1149
00:51:08,030 --> 00:51:09,010
you have uh,
uh,

1150
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:14,160
Hussam [inaudible] coming out coming out
of nowhere and people I think are still 

1151
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:17,710
giving them more like,
well he's making the leg locks work 

1152
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:17,720
because he shows strong and he's so 
scary.

1153
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:22,900
And so because people do feel like we 
need to see it a few more times from 

1154
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:22,900
different people.
Hey,

1155
00:51:22,970 --> 00:51:25,640
I hope leg lock works.
The more submissions on the ground,

1156
00:51:25,641 --> 00:51:30,641
the better.
I love the way with smart pull in 

1157
00:51:30,641 --> 00:51:30,641
garden,
the leg locks.

1158
00:51:30,641 --> 00:51:31,340
He's not even trying to take dudes down.
Well,

1159
00:51:31,341 --> 00:51:33,590
you know what I think is when Alan 
belcher figured it out,

1160
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:35,690
yes,
Alan belcher figured it out.

1161
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:38,720
I mean he willingly went into his half 
guard.

1162
00:51:38,721 --> 00:51:41,090
He willingly went to the ground with.
That's the biggest mistake.

1163
00:51:41,091 --> 00:51:43,880
People make up poems.
He defended every single step of the way

1164
00:51:43,881 --> 00:51:46,220
and then beat them down and stop them.
I think at the high level,

1165
00:51:46,221 --> 00:51:51,221
that's what it looks like.
I think if the guys is kind of shaky 

1166
00:51:51,221 --> 00:51:54,641
about leg locks and he's not like,
he doesn't have leg lock defense in his 

1167
00:51:54,641 --> 00:51:54,641
DNA,
he's going to get caught.

1168
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:59,860
But Alan spent two months solid with a 
dean lister floorman a Davi Ramos who's 

1169
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:05,860
a mini pet horse leg and he said the 
first two weeks he just got leg locked 

1170
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:09,940
all day and after a while you learn how 
to slow it down and then you get tapped 

1171
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:13,040
and you slow it down and then you get 
tapped and you slow it down and then you

1172
00:52:13,041 --> 00:52:15,620
start attacking because that's what he 
said.

1173
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:20,890
So I think maybe with the leg game,
if everybody got really good at the 

1174
00:52:20,890 --> 00:52:23,450
defense that yes,
you can get,

1175
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:28,720
you can get in these positions and avoid
getting hit because I think the saddle 

1176
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,680
and the honeywell,
I think it's pretty safe right where you

1177
00:52:30,710 --> 00:52:32,390
ain't going to get hit there,
they can't reach you.

1178
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:37,780
But if the guy defends it and is 
comfortable defending it and then can 

1179
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:38,690
sit up in a certain spot and sprawl out 
on you,

1180
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:40,820
then it could be a trouble.

1181
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:43,250
I'm not a,
I'm rooting for leg locks and mma.

1182
00:52:43,550 --> 00:52:48,550
Trust me,
I'm just not 100 percent I need is once 

1183
00:52:48,550 --> 00:52:48,550
the punches coming,
once they start flying.

1184
00:52:48,550 --> 00:52:52,160
I hear Ryan Hall is making leg lock 
works in an MMA training.

1185
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:56,080
So uh,
maybe maybe like maybe leg locks,

1186
00:52:56,090 --> 00:53:01,090
um,
will be the future of or part of the 

1187
00:53:01,090 --> 00:53:01,990
future of grappling.
And well,

1188
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:07,000
you know,
we always have this conception but this 

1189
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:07,000
idea of it because of Frank Mir versus 
Ian Freeman.

1190
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,450
I mean,
that's like cemented in people's heads.

1191
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:11,930
Remember Frank Mir is going for the heel
hook look like he's got it locked up.

1192
00:53:12,050 --> 00:53:17,050
And he's like,
Ian Friedman's teeing off on his face 

1193
00:53:17,050 --> 00:53:17,050
while he's holding onto his leg that 
was,

1194
00:53:17,050 --> 00:53:19,230
gets he stomped on me.
He got fucked up that.

1195
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:21,500
And that was when frank was a monster.
I mean,

1196
00:53:21,501 --> 00:53:24,260
frank was real young,
wild and aggressive.

1197
00:53:24,261 --> 00:53:25,950
Romeo Santo and walking

1198
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:28,170
Hanson.
Assad was very good at leg locks,

1199
00:53:28,171 --> 00:53:30,600
had a toehold,
what can enhance and caught him once and

1200
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:33,720
hit them two or three times.
And he was just how it started.

1201
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:34,350
So,
okay,

1202
00:53:34,351 --> 00:53:39,351
who's caring?
Who's got better leg locked technique 

1203
00:53:39,351 --> 00:53:41,850
imagery or Paul Harris because 
[inaudible] has worked some dudes needs 

1204
00:53:41,850 --> 00:53:46,071
to.
I think in an Aria is probably more 

1205
00:53:46,071 --> 00:53:46,071
technical.
What do you think?

1206
00:53:46,071 --> 00:53:46,071
Um,
no I,

1207
00:53:46,071 --> 00:53:47,730
no I didn't come and says no.
Yeah,

1208
00:53:47,731 --> 00:53:50,040
I think that you're,
you're seeing kind of,

1209
00:53:51,090 --> 00:53:52,710
first of all,
you're seeing two people,

1210
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:57,120
um,
do leg locks to people that are,

1211
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:00,080
that don't have any clue what they're 
doing when it comes to like locking,

1212
00:54:00,210 --> 00:54:02,010
right?
So it's in the MMA world,

1213
00:54:02,011 --> 00:54:07,011
not to discredit anybody that uses them 
effectively and under nay pars is using 

1214
00:54:07,011 --> 00:54:07,011
them effectively in both.
Um,

1215
00:54:07,011 --> 00:54:08,940
but then when you're watching people use
like locks and fights,

1216
00:54:09,150 --> 00:54:10,500
you can't just credit,
you can just be like,

1217
00:54:10,501 --> 00:54:15,501
oh my God,
that dude's leg locks are amazing 

1218
00:54:15,501 --> 00:54:15,501
because they're going,
again,

1219
00:54:15,501 --> 00:54:19,290
in terms of grappling,
they're going on somebody that doesn't 

1220
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:19,950
have any clue what they're doing most of
the time anyway.

1221
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:21,140
Um,
but uh,

1222
00:54:21,210 --> 00:54:22,440
in terms of,
you know,

1223
00:54:22,441 --> 00:54:23,550
who's,
who's better,

1224
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:27,870
I mean it's clear that the headway that 
[inaudible] is made with an outside,

1225
00:54:27,871 --> 00:54:31,020
he'll hook is just way above anyone 
else.

1226
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:36,470
[inaudible] has some other,
I'd say men are better at some of these 

1227
00:54:36,470 --> 00:54:38,460
technical transitions that he does.
Some very unique,

1228
00:54:38,490 --> 00:54:39,780
you know,
counters and unique,

1229
00:54:39,810 --> 00:54:40,230
uh,
you know,

1230
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:43,550
attacks entries as well.
Yeah,

1231
00:54:43,551 --> 00:54:45,990
I mean we definitely study them and try 
and use some of that stuff.

1232
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:47,820
So I think he's just a little bit more 
creative,

1233
00:54:47,821 --> 00:54:50,150
a little bit more unique,
but I don't think necessarily.

1234
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,860
I think Paul Harris has a better system.
Okay.

1235
00:54:52,861 --> 00:54:57,861
Paul Harris has a better system for 
breaking a limb as opposed to a lot of 

1236
00:54:57,861 --> 00:54:59,550
creative transitions and can eventually 
submit somebody.

1237
00:54:59,551 --> 00:55:04,551
But you know,
if you ever think about getting a 

1238
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:04,810
private with Paul Harris,
uh,

1239
00:55:04,890 --> 00:55:05,790
no,
because I,

1240
00:55:05,950 --> 00:55:10,950
you know,
I favor my knees and I don't want to 

1241
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:10,950
get.

1242
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:14,630
Oh,
you definitely just break my legs for 

1243
00:55:14,630 --> 00:55:14,630
sure.
I mean,

1244
00:55:14,630 --> 00:55:14,630
he'd try anyway.
We'd say,

1245
00:55:14,630 --> 00:55:15,180
oh for sure.
For sure.

1246
00:55:15,390 --> 00:55:16,830
Dude.
The guy's a crazy person.

1247
00:55:17,070 --> 00:55:20,070
They brought in a sports psychologist to
try and like,

1248
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:25,100
hey,
why are you breaking your training 

1249
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:25,100
partners legs and everybody's legs and 
competition and not letting go.

1250
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:26,340
And the sports psychologist after week 
was like,

1251
00:55:26,341 --> 00:55:28,800
fuck this.
I don't know what the day brought him in

1252
00:55:28,801 --> 00:55:33,801
because he was breaking his,
his training partners to camps and 

1253
00:55:33,801 --> 00:55:33,801
stuff.
Dude.

1254
00:55:33,801 --> 00:55:33,801
Yeah.
Whoa.

1255
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:37,620
God Damn Eddie,
you're nodding as well.

1256
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:38,300
Yeah.
Just wondered.

1257
00:55:38,330 --> 00:55:42,930
Confirmation across the board.
So he had a tow childhood man.

1258
00:55:42,931 --> 00:55:45,630
You hear about his childhood that,
that big scar across his chest.

1259
00:55:45,631 --> 00:55:48,270
They tried to Krazy glue.
That shit's shut when he was like a kid.

1260
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:49,230
Wow.
Yeah.

1261
00:55:49,231 --> 00:55:51,240
He grew up on a farm,
a pig slop,

1262
00:55:51,241 --> 00:55:52,230
and he was like 13.

1263
00:55:52,230 --> 00:55:54,670
It's a really heartbreaking story.
Not surprised at all.

1264
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:56,520
Been working since he was like a little 
kid.

1265
00:55:56,550 --> 00:55:58,470
It's one of the reasons why he's so 
fucking strong.

1266
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:03,390
Pig slop has something to do with it.
You got to start getting pixel up.

1267
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:07,800
I'm sure you added some other things.
Says Diet once you got some of them wake

1268
00:56:07,801 --> 00:56:12,570
up in the morning.
It's just super dense in protein.

1269
00:56:12,571 --> 00:56:15,030
Tastes like shit,
but it's good for your plus.

1270
00:56:15,031 --> 00:56:20,031
It's like an instant fecal transplant as
well because reading a little bit of 

1271
00:56:20,031 --> 00:56:20,031
picture in there.
Perfect.

1272
00:56:21,610 --> 00:56:24,190
Me.
See his fight with Fitch.

1273
00:56:24,610 --> 00:56:25,480
Uh,
no I haven't.

1274
00:56:25,850 --> 00:56:30,790
I've been watching a lot of highlights 
specifically actually explained it.

1275
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:33,340
Alan belcher actually went over like 
what he did wrong.

1276
00:56:33,810 --> 00:56:37,190
Like it's pretty interesting man.
He had a video outlining the technique,

1277
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:40,170
how to defend and how par has went to 
straight leg lock.

1278
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:42,640
Nobody did and what he should or the way
you have done it.

1279
00:56:42,641 --> 00:56:44,680
And the way you did do it.
So really interesting.

1280
00:56:44,681 --> 00:56:48,130
Alan Belcher is a wizard when it comes.
That's the way Paul Harris got the fight

1281
00:56:48,131 --> 00:56:49,490
to the ground.
He's fighting John Fitch,

1282
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:53,650
Ncaa Division One wrestler.
How did he take them down?

1283
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:56,770
He didn't even try,
he just shot for a week,

1284
00:56:56,771 --> 00:56:59,380
single and just sat down and went for a 
leg lock.

1285
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:05,160
Once he gets a hold of you,
it's like you have a whole new level of 

1286
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:08,761
Oh fuck.
Like everybody has in their head like a 

1287
00:57:08,761 --> 00:57:08,761
level of Oh fuck.

1288
00:57:08,761 --> 00:57:08,761
Like,
okay,

1289
00:57:08,761 --> 00:57:09,010
I'm okay here.
I'm okay here.

1290
00:57:09,011 --> 00:57:12,250
I can defend here.
But I think he's so God damn strong.

1291
00:57:12,310 --> 00:57:14,770
And on top of that it's technique.
So sharp.

1292
00:57:14,970 --> 00:57:17,760
Then went to grabs a whole,
you see this look on dudes faces.

1293
00:57:17,770 --> 00:57:18,490
They're like,
Oh shit,

1294
00:57:18,670 --> 00:57:23,670
I'm not getting out of this.
Guys are letting him get where he wants 

1295
00:57:23,670 --> 00:57:23,670
to be though,
you know,

1296
00:57:23,670 --> 00:57:23,900
like most of them anyway.
Um,

1297
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:29,220
you know,
the better strategy is to put him where 

1298
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:29,220
you want them as opposed to,
Oh yeah,

1299
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:30,100
I'm just going to keep this on the feet.
No you're not,

1300
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:31,420
you're not going to keep this on the 
feet.

1301
00:57:31,421 --> 00:57:33,120
He's going to find a way to get to the 
leg lock,

1302
00:57:33,190 --> 00:57:34,150
lock guard,
put them,

1303
00:57:34,210 --> 00:57:35,830
put them down,
put them down.

1304
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:38,110
Shows you what a Demon Hector Lombard 
is.

1305
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:41,140
Because Hector Lumbar was like getting a
hold of my legs.

1306
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:44,020
He beat the shit out of him.

1307
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:45,670
How did the fight go?
Stoppage.

1308
00:57:45,830 --> 00:57:47,560
Lombard stopped him.
He just couldn't take them down.

1309
00:57:47,561 --> 00:57:49,450
Couldn't take them down,
couldn't get him into leg lock,

1310
00:57:49,451 --> 00:57:51,310
couldn't do anything with them.
Never got him to the ground.

1311
00:57:51,370 --> 00:57:54,460
Did he try to pull dark to Lombard?
Is Stupid.

1312
00:57:54,461 --> 00:57:56,230
Strong,
stupid,

1313
00:57:56,231 --> 00:58:01,231
strong.
He's the only guy I've ever seen lockup 

1314
00:58:01,231 --> 00:58:01,960
with Tim Bush and just face plant him 
just by,

1315
00:58:01,990 --> 00:58:06,990
by polar like Tim Bush was trying to 
shoot and take them down and he sprawled

1316
00:58:07,151 --> 00:58:11,980
and just slammed him into the ground 
like he's so God damn strong.

1317
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:15,040
And on top of that he's got ridiculous 
technique.

1318
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:19,340
You know his judo is off the charts and 
then he's got submissions to men.

1319
00:58:19,341 --> 00:58:21,130
There's a video of him in a submission.
Grappling match.

1320
00:58:21,131 --> 00:58:22,990
We snapped to dude's leg and you can 
hear it.

1321
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:25,150
You could hear the snap.
Nothing grip.

1322
00:58:26,110 --> 00:58:28,090
Which one?
Lombard.

1323
00:58:28,091 --> 00:58:30,610
Hector Lombard gets a dude in a leg lock
and snaps his leg.

1324
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:35,760
I think I've seen it.
Sounds like you've got them in like a 

1325
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:35,760
straight ankle lock.
And you hear a crack number,

1326
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:38,950
John Lobur got his foot broken off with 
a toehold in Japan.

1327
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,970
The whole foot just broke off and he's 
just looking at it.

1328
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,320
They flipped hanging and the ref stops 
it.

1329
00:58:44,321 --> 00:58:46,210
And he's like,
oh shit,

1330
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:49,120
the pancreas.
But the whole,

1331
00:58:49,330 --> 00:58:50,950
it was like a,
like,

1332
00:58:50,951 --> 00:58:54,000
um,
Anderson Silva's leg tonight,

1333
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,010
Jesus Christ.
When you really stop and think about the

1334
00:58:58,180 --> 00:59:02,230
progression over the years and all the 
crazy fights you put like you gotta wake

1335
00:59:02,231 --> 00:59:07,231
your brain up to that fight.
Have you guys looked into the CSW leg 

1336
00:59:07,231 --> 00:59:10,831
lock system with Eric Paulson?
You guys look at him and I trained at a 

1337
00:59:10,831 --> 00:59:10,831
school once,
um,

1338
00:59:10,831 --> 00:59:13,180
but you know,
in terms of like looking at their system

1339
00:59:13,181 --> 00:59:15,440
of like Luxe,
I'm not as attuned to it.

1340
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:17,470
Eddie.
Eddie does a lot more research than me,

1341
00:59:17,471 --> 00:59:18,460
you know,
as you called people,

1342
00:59:18,461 --> 00:59:20,740
Bjj nerds,
that's for sure.

1343
00:59:21,110 --> 00:59:22,010
Um,
so

1344
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:23,320
you're just like,
Eddie,

1345
00:59:23,321 --> 00:59:24,110
what?
What's next?

1346
00:59:24,130 --> 00:59:24,910
What does it mean?
Shit?

1347
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:25,970
Yeah.
You don't want to go.

1348
00:59:25,971 --> 00:59:27,760
I do a little bit of research,
but it's not.

1349
00:59:27,761 --> 00:59:30,050
I don't do extensive stuff.
You know what I mean?

1350
00:59:30,051 --> 00:59:31,680
I've just trained it all the time and 
you know,

1351
00:59:31,681 --> 00:59:31,950
I,
I,

1352
00:59:32,330 --> 00:59:35,900
luckily I live in an age where have all 
these people around me that,

1353
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:37,310
you know,
study and,

1354
00:59:37,450 --> 00:59:38,600
you know,
the martial art,

1355
00:59:38,630 --> 00:59:38,930
you know,
like,

1356
00:59:38,931 --> 00:59:39,890
I always think about that,
like,

1357
00:59:39,891 --> 00:59:44,891
think back to like,
what was it like when nobody knew what 

1358
00:59:44,891 --> 00:59:47,681
the fuck they were doing and you just 
had to make everything up and you had 

1359
00:59:47,681 --> 00:59:47,681
nothing to go off of,
you know what I mean?

1360
00:59:47,681 --> 00:59:48,950
Now we're in this era where it's like,
you know,

1361
00:59:48,951 --> 00:59:50,480
I could go to John with pretty much 
anything.

1362
00:59:50,481 --> 00:59:55,481
I'm going to get 95 percent accurate 
answer to whatever question is that I 

1363
00:59:55,481 --> 00:59:56,390
have because he's seen it 100 times 
before on tape,

1364
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:57,440
you know what I mean?

1365
00:59:57,570 --> 00:59:59,990
Um,
we don't have to innovate as much.

1366
01:00:00,470 --> 01:00:02,450
Are you planning on finding an mma?
Yeah.

1367
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:03,980
One or two years,
you know,

1368
01:00:03,981 --> 01:00:05,930
I gotta I don't know old people in the 
face yet.

1369
01:00:05,931 --> 01:00:08,000
So how old I am?
Twenty three.

1370
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:11,750
And um,
so you're just concentrating on striking

1371
01:00:11,751 --> 01:00:12,830
before you do it.
Yeah.

1372
01:00:12,831 --> 01:00:14,900
I just want to learn.
I want to know what I'm doing before.

1373
01:00:14,901 --> 01:00:16,010
I do know,
wrestled your whole life,

1374
01:00:16,011 --> 01:00:16,730
right?
Uh,

1375
01:00:16,731 --> 01:00:21,731
I wrestled from fifth to ninth grade and
I started doing Jujitsu so it gave me a 

1376
01:00:21,731 --> 01:00:22,520
little bit of a grappling based,
but it wasn't a,

1377
01:00:22,530 --> 01:00:23,180
you know,
I mean,

1378
01:00:23,210 --> 01:00:23,920
it wasn't,
you know,

1379
01:00:23,930 --> 01:00:25,450
I knew how to do a single and a double 
leg,

1380
01:00:25,451 --> 01:00:27,020
like things in the ground.
Nothing serious.

1381
01:00:27,021 --> 01:00:29,960
Nothing that I really remember.
Now I do wrestling privates with a d,

1382
01:00:29,961 --> 01:00:34,961
One guy Matt Fletcher.
I'm on a biweekly to two a week.

1383
01:00:35,290 --> 01:00:36,740
And what kind of striking training 
you're doing?

1384
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:40,190
Striking training has started working 
with Frank Savannah,

1385
01:00:40,270 --> 01:00:41,950
a boxing coach.
She's,

1386
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:43,970
I'm just doing it like once a week.
Right.

1387
01:00:43,971 --> 01:00:46,310
You don't have time to.
I am in Manhattan,

1388
01:00:46,311 --> 01:00:48,140
but I haven't checked anybody out in the
area.

1389
01:00:48,141 --> 01:00:53,141
I've just been doing stuff in Jersey,
bringing people to me because I run a 

1390
01:00:53,141 --> 01:00:55,481
school.
So it's hard for me now because Enzo is 

1391
01:00:55,481 --> 01:00:56,420
who's connected with a lot.
Right.

1392
01:00:58,110 --> 01:01:02,720
Like Phil nurse doesn't want you guys 
all somewhat somewhat connected.

1393
01:01:02,721 --> 01:01:04,480
You have some guys teaching,
but um,

1394
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:09,600
you know,
I haven't gotten in touch with those 

1395
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:09,600
guys.
Um,

1396
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:09,650
it's just,
I'm just a real basic level right now,

1397
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:13,730
so I just want to get to a point where I
can start going to some professionals,

1398
01:01:13,731 --> 01:01:16,430
but it's almost like with Jujitsu,
without knowing anything,

1399
01:01:16,431 --> 01:01:18,620
like what uses it to go to the best guy 
in the world,

1400
01:01:18,621 --> 01:01:19,010
you know what I mean?

1401
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:20,660
Well,
you know what dude with a guy,

1402
01:01:20,661 --> 01:01:25,661
as good as you are,
I think the most important thing is you 

1403
01:01:25,661 --> 01:01:28,901
go to like whoever you go to,
if you decided to embark on your mma 

1404
01:01:29,091 --> 01:01:30,500
career,
go to someone,

1405
01:01:30,501 --> 01:01:33,920
but it's got a full knowledge like a for
Rasa hobby type.

1406
01:01:33,921 --> 01:01:34,640
Dude,
look,

1407
01:01:34,730 --> 01:01:38,780
someone's got a full knowledge of MMA.
Guys are so gigantic.

1408
01:01:38,990 --> 01:01:40,920
I don't think they get the credit that 
they deserve.

1409
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:45,940
Yeah man,
the Duke Roufus is of the world and you 

1410
01:01:45,940 --> 01:01:45,940
know,
those,

1411
01:01:45,940 --> 01:01:47,030
those guys that just look,
look at the whole package of what you do

1412
01:01:47,031 --> 01:01:49,820
as a fighter and piece together the 
right strategy for you.

1413
01:01:50,090 --> 01:01:51,950
We have good connections with a,
you know,

1414
01:01:51,990 --> 01:01:54,230
for us,
for us and that camp,

1415
01:01:54,231 --> 01:01:59,231
you know,
their guys come to us for Jujitsu and 

1416
01:01:59,231 --> 01:01:59,450
our guys go down to them from me.
So I'm definitely hoping once I,

1417
01:01:59,510 --> 01:02:02,300
once I get some striking and shoot 
boxing to a certain level,

1418
01:02:02,310 --> 01:02:03,890
I'd love to go down there,
you know,

1419
01:02:03,891 --> 01:02:05,840
like I said,
it's just so I feel like,

1420
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:10,940
you know,
almost they wouldn't know what to do 

1421
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:10,940
with me at this point just because I'm 
just so,

1422
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:10,940
you know,
base level right now.

1423
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,860
Useless to go down.
I don't want to waste their time.

1424
01:02:12,861 --> 01:02:15,100
So you just turned the box from your 
train more time.

1425
01:02:15,310 --> 01:02:18,440
I'm just boxing right now.
My boxing coach told me that he thinks,

1426
01:02:18,441 --> 01:02:20,220
you know,
I used to spend about six months purely

1427
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:22,340
unboxing before I jump into Moitai.
Um,

1428
01:02:22,341 --> 01:02:25,000
you could probably do it either way,
but that's a good idea man.

1429
01:02:25,001 --> 01:02:27,600
He kind of contrast the two things that 
they're trying to teach you.

1430
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:31,080
So focused on one thing first and then 
I'll jump into that for sure.

1431
01:02:31,170 --> 01:02:33,830
Yeah.
I get those mechanics down and then uh,

1432
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:36,930
the trans transition is very important 
though some people don't make it,

1433
01:02:37,430 --> 01:02:39,960
don't make it,
and the guy has leg kicks are just,

1434
01:02:39,990 --> 01:02:43,170
they come into play,
the elbows and knees come into play.

1435
01:02:43,171 --> 01:02:44,310
There's too many things that come into 
play.

1436
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:49,700
Guys make the mistake of focusing 
primarily on boxing just because it 

1437
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:50,020
feels good to punch somebody in the 
face.

1438
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:55,520
Pretty good at it.
It's not an awkward movement for your 

1439
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:56,580
body.
Seems pretty self explanatory.

1440
01:02:56,581 --> 01:03:01,581
Everybody understands it.
But then kicking is this whole thing 

1441
01:03:01,581 --> 01:03:03,560
where you're moving your body in a way 
that seemed awkward and you're,

1442
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:07,650
you have to think about where you're and
foot placement goes to some guys,

1443
01:03:07,651 --> 01:03:09,530
they just become that boxer,
a wrestler,

1444
01:03:09,540 --> 01:03:11,940
Jujitsu type guy,
but can't do that anymore,

1445
01:03:11,941 --> 01:03:12,300
man.

1446
01:03:12,340 --> 01:03:15,240
It's just Vittori Belfort's we'll 
kicking you in the head.

1447
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:18,120
You know what I mean?
It's like now it's on such a weird level

1448
01:03:18,121 --> 01:03:23,121
that guys can do things.
Guys that are like super high level and 

1449
01:03:23,121 --> 01:03:26,601
everything.
They'll always have that advantage over 

1450
01:03:26,601 --> 01:03:26,601
you in this one thing.
Like when your,

1451
01:03:26,601 --> 01:03:30,150
as you're planning out your future,
super important to look at all the 

1452
01:03:30,150 --> 01:03:30,150
spots.
Some guys never do that,

1453
01:03:30,150 --> 01:03:35,061
you know,
like no one ever expects shale son and 

1454
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:35,061
throw a head kick.
You know what I mean?

1455
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:39,770
Like he's a good example of it.
No one ever expected him to just never 

1456
01:03:39,770 --> 01:03:41,340
put that as a threat.
It was never.

1457
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:45,900
But like a guy like a GSP or fill in the
blank,

1458
01:03:46,050 --> 01:03:48,630
they can kind of do anything.
Perfect example.

1459
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:50,550
Mean you can do anything.
Yeah,

1460
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:52,870
definitely makes you more dangerous for 
sure.

1461
01:03:53,350 --> 01:03:58,350
If Jujitsu,
like professional Jujitsu was a big 

1462
01:03:58,350 --> 01:03:58,350
thing.

1463
01:03:58,350 --> 01:04:01,940
It was on television,
it was a major league sport tour we're 

1464
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:04,881
trying to go.
But would you go into mma or would you 

1465
01:04:04,881 --> 01:04:05,250
stay with you?
It's an interesting question.

1466
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:10,760
I haven't really considered it yet 
because we just haven't gotten it to 

1467
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:10,760
that level.
Um,

1468
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:14,870
I think,
I think I would still try it at some 

1469
01:04:14,870 --> 01:04:18,231
point to transition into May.
Maybe I would hold it off for a little 

1470
01:04:18,231 --> 01:04:18,231
bit longer.
Like if I really,

1471
01:04:18,231 --> 01:04:20,360
if I really saw that the sport was 
taking off and I,

1472
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:22,740
you know,
I felt like that's where I could make my

1473
01:04:22,741 --> 01:04:24,330
headway and that's where I could make my
mark.

1474
01:04:24,510 --> 01:04:26,100
I definitely spend a lot more time 
there.

1475
01:04:26,220 --> 01:04:31,220
I still think I would like to make a 
transition and a purely for so purely 

1476
01:04:31,220 --> 01:04:31,890
for,
for a few reasons.

1477
01:04:31,891 --> 01:04:33,120
One,
just to test myself,

1478
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:35,630
I'm at a new thing to,
um,

1479
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:37,500
to make sure that I have the knowledge 
for when,

1480
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:39,450
you know,
somebody comes up to me and goes,

1481
01:04:39,510 --> 01:04:44,510
oh yeah,
I want to make a transition to mma from 

1482
01:04:44,510 --> 01:04:44,510
Jujitsu.

1483
01:04:44,510 --> 01:04:44,510
What's your advice?
Well,

1484
01:04:44,510 --> 01:04:45,780
I can't really give them advice if I've 
never done it before.

1485
01:04:45,781 --> 01:04:46,710
I don't feel like,
you know,

1486
01:04:47,030 --> 01:04:48,930
so I want to really know what I'm 
talking about.

1487
01:04:48,931 --> 01:04:53,931
If I'm talking to these guys,
these young guys that want to come up 

1488
01:04:53,931 --> 01:04:54,490
and do something with an a instead of 
just Jujitsu.

1489
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:55,860
So I,
I definitely,

1490
01:04:55,861 --> 01:05:00,861
from a teaching perspective,
I need to get into Nma and experience 

1491
01:05:00,861 --> 01:05:00,980
that and know what it's like.
That's,

1492
01:05:01,110 --> 01:05:06,110
that's how I feel anyway,
regardless of whether or not Jujitsu 

1493
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:06,110
takes off and it's on tv and all that 
stuff.

1494
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:08,550
Are you planning on ever doing any 
amateur boxing matches or anything along

1495
01:05:08,551 --> 01:05:13,551
those wild?
I got to talk to some of my coaches and 

1496
01:05:13,551 --> 01:05:13,551
stuff and see what they think is best in
terms of,

1497
01:05:13,551 --> 01:05:15,060
you know,
my development and things like that.

1498
01:05:15,090 --> 01:05:17,320
I would imagine that that probably,
you know,

1499
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:18,520
would be good for sure.

1500
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:19,510
Um,
I,

1501
01:05:19,511 --> 01:05:24,511
I want to avoid a as much as possible.
I'm going the route of just getting 

1502
01:05:24,511 --> 01:05:26,710
knocked out all the time and training 
and stuff like that and just having that

1503
01:05:26,711 --> 01:05:28,840
just gritty type of training where 
you're just,

1504
01:05:29,230 --> 01:05:30,800
it's just getting you tough,
you know,

1505
01:05:30,801 --> 01:05:35,801
in quotation marks.
And then I'll get to a point where I'm 

1506
01:05:35,801 --> 01:05:35,801
in a fight and I'm just getting touched 
on the Chin and knocked out.

1507
01:05:35,820 --> 01:05:39,400
I want to make sure I'm focusing mostly 
on technical details and then putting it

1508
01:05:39,401 --> 01:05:44,401
all together.
So smart and so happy to hear you say 

1509
01:05:44,401 --> 01:05:44,530
that.
So one of the most important things,

1510
01:05:44,860 --> 01:05:47,260
you know Jamie Varner just did this 
interview recently,

1511
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:52,320
Jim Varner,
who was a former WEC lightweight 

1512
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:52,320
champion,
really tough guy,

1513
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:56,780
did this interview recently.
We said I shortened my career because I 

1514
01:05:56,780 --> 01:05:57,940
spar too hard as far too often our 
bigger guys,

1515
01:05:58,350 --> 01:06:03,350
you started talking about I was sparring
Ryan Bader and all these dudes are way 

1516
01:06:03,350 --> 01:06:06,901
bigger than him and that over those 
years of doing all that sparring with 

1517
01:06:06,901 --> 01:06:09,340
these larger guys and sporing really 
hard three days a week.

1518
01:06:09,670 --> 01:06:10,940
He's like,
don't try to prove you're tough,

1519
01:06:11,290 --> 01:06:12,460
you're tough,
you're in the UFC.

1520
01:06:12,490 --> 01:06:15,130
You really tough,
like don't just try to do it right.

1521
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:17,380
And he said sometimes you don't even 
have to do with once a week,

1522
01:06:17,381 --> 01:06:18,880
once every other week maybe even.
Yeah,

1523
01:06:18,881 --> 01:06:23,881
that's what I'm thinking in terms of 
like when I get to the sparring and 

1524
01:06:23,881 --> 01:06:23,881
stuff like that.
For sure.

1525
01:06:23,881 --> 01:06:26,170
I used to spar back in the day like 
probably like three,

1526
01:06:26,171 --> 01:06:27,330
four years ago.
Uh,

1527
01:06:27,340 --> 01:06:27,910
when,
uh,

1528
01:06:27,911 --> 01:06:32,911
you know,
some of my teammates is starting to do 

1529
01:06:32,911 --> 01:06:34,340
it some mma.
I just did it for fun and for some 

1530
01:06:34,340 --> 01:06:34,340
experience and things like that,
but it was,

1531
01:06:34,340 --> 01:06:36,880
it was stupid and dangerous for me to be
doing that without really knowing what I

1532
01:06:36,881 --> 01:06:38,440
was doing in terms of striking.
I think,

1533
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:40,720
you know,
because all I was really doing,

1534
01:06:40,721 --> 01:06:43,330
I mean all I was really doing was,
you know,

1535
01:06:43,540 --> 01:06:45,270
hitting until I could get to a take 
anyway.

1536
01:06:45,270 --> 01:06:50,270
But I mean just taking unnecessary 
damage for no reason from people that 

1537
01:06:50,270 --> 01:06:50,270
wanted to take my head off,
you know,

1538
01:06:50,270 --> 01:06:52,120
it's not smart and people think it's 
cute.

1539
01:06:52,180 --> 01:06:57,180
They think it's fun.
Like this guy doesn't even know how to 

1540
01:06:57,180 --> 01:06:57,180
box.
Once we touch them up,

1541
01:06:57,180 --> 01:06:58,960
get in there and throw hard hooks on 
your fucking head.

1542
01:06:58,961 --> 01:07:00,940
You don't even see them coming and that,
those,

1543
01:07:00,970 --> 01:07:03,370
those shots that you take in those 
sparring sessions,

1544
01:07:03,371 --> 01:07:05,770
they could really fuck you up now for a 
long time.

1545
01:07:05,771 --> 01:07:07,150
The lad that had never really,
you know,

1546
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:09,580
I didn't have to pay the price for that 
at all.

1547
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:14,700
If you could find guys that sparked 
technically really fast and have good 

1548
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:16,360
control of man,
you can progress so far.

1549
01:07:16,410 --> 01:07:21,410
Yeah,
because it takes away all the fear of 

1550
01:07:21,410 --> 01:07:23,791
getting hit.
If you just find like it's just hard to 

1551
01:07:23,791 --> 01:07:23,791
find the ties apparently have a down.

1552
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:26,870
I was talking with John Wayne par when 
he was on the podcast and he said they,

1553
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:31,980
they spar like they play,
like when they're kicking each other 

1554
01:07:31,980 --> 01:07:35,491
though like slapping each other and 
because there's fighting every week so 

1555
01:07:35,491 --> 01:07:38,701
they don't want to get hurt.
So when they're sparring they're like 

1556
01:07:38,701 --> 01:07:38,701
playing with each other.
No one's trying to hurt anybody.

1557
01:07:39,030 --> 01:07:44,030
It should always be like that and that's
like the biggest problem for people 

1558
01:07:44,030 --> 01:07:46,681
starting out in training Jiu Jitsu to 
get that guy that's just squeezes 

1559
01:07:46,681 --> 01:07:47,830
everything and you need to be able to 
relax,

1560
01:07:47,831 --> 01:07:52,831
get submitted and move around.
Like you have to be comfortable and all 

1561
01:07:52,831 --> 01:07:52,831
that stuff.
You know?

1562
01:07:52,831 --> 01:07:56,940
It's like a hard thing for me to teach 
new people coming in and it's like the 

1563
01:07:56,940 --> 01:08:00,511
hardest transition.
Get them to a point where they're 

1564
01:08:00,511 --> 01:08:00,850
comfortable enough to relax and then 
just let their mind open up to like what

1565
01:08:00,851 --> 01:08:01,950
they should be doing now.
Yeah.

1566
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:05,690
It seems like it's just time.
It's the only thing that fixes that time

1567
01:08:05,890 --> 01:08:10,890
and everything and striking to and you 
see guys that trained for a long time 

1568
01:08:10,890 --> 01:08:14,821
and maintain that mentality and still 
are just like you did just rough and 

1569
01:08:14,821 --> 01:08:16,160
tough guys that are trying as hard as 
they can,

1570
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:18,620
every single role and they're not making
a lot of progress.

1571
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:23,680
I see plenty of people like that so time
but with good direction from like 

1572
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:27,820
coaches and teammates and things like 
that because there's still plenty of 

1573
01:08:27,820 --> 01:08:28,550
guys that you could be training for 10 
years and you're just still trained like

1574
01:08:28,551 --> 01:08:33,551
a jerk off.
So there's a lot of those guys that 

1575
01:08:33,551 --> 01:08:34,700
never really developed much,
much offense either.

1576
01:08:34,701 --> 01:08:37,280
They have like a couple of good moves 
that they look glad to.

1577
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:42,880
That's a weird thing.
And then some people just figured out 

1578
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:46,091
how to get like,
how many years were you doing Jiu Jitsu 

1579
01:08:46,091 --> 01:08:46,091
will you started hitting like a real 
high level?

1580
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:48,170
Um,
I mean I think,

1581
01:08:48,740 --> 01:08:49,370
you know,
I,

1582
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:50,780
I mean it was a,
it was a progression.

1583
01:08:50,781 --> 01:08:53,150
I was focused on like points Jujitsu for
a long time.

1584
01:08:53,151 --> 01:08:58,151
I was still trying to submit people,
my strategy was I'm going to get to the 

1585
01:08:58,151 --> 01:09:00,560
back because there's a high score for 
points there and I could do a rear naked

1586
01:09:00,561 --> 01:09:03,890
choke,
said you highly effective submission and

1587
01:09:03,891 --> 01:09:04,910
it's low risk,
you know,

1588
01:09:04,940 --> 01:09:06,320
so that was my strategy for everything.

1589
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:11,320
So the first five years of my training 
was all dedicated to that from every 

1590
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:11,320
position.
Let's get to this guy's back,

1591
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:12,980
choke him from behind,
keep this simple,

1592
01:09:12,981 --> 01:09:15,620
I'm going to have more points and I'm 
going to be able to submit.

1593
01:09:15,621 --> 01:09:17,820
The guy passed that.
Those,

1594
01:09:17,870 --> 01:09:22,870
these last three years I think I've made
the biggest developments in terms of 

1595
01:09:22,870 --> 01:09:26,231
like broadening my submission base and 
learning how to submit people from 

1596
01:09:26,231 --> 01:09:29,111
different places and things like that.
But I think it was kind of good for my 

1597
01:09:29,111 --> 01:09:29,111
progression,
you know,

1598
01:09:29,111 --> 01:09:33,010
because I got positionally sound in a 
bunch of different and had like a 

1599
01:09:33,010 --> 01:09:33,010
strategy and things like that.
But it,

1600
01:09:33,010 --> 01:09:36,110
it took till I was a black belt to 
really make advances.

1601
01:09:36,111 --> 01:09:37,550
And in Jujitsu,
I feel like,

1602
01:09:37,551 --> 01:09:38,780
you know,
high level,

1603
01:09:38,810 --> 01:09:43,810
what do you,
how do you feel about what submission 

1604
01:09:43,810 --> 01:09:44,360
only versus the points game?

1605
01:09:44,980 --> 01:09:46,100
Um,
I mean,

1606
01:09:46,130 --> 01:09:48,320
I think it,
it takes a couple of different things,

1607
01:09:48,321 --> 01:09:48,820
you know,
like,

1608
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:54,310
so I mean you could see people that are 
possibly successful in both are 

1609
01:09:54,310 --> 01:09:54,500
successful in one or the other.
Um,

1610
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:59,560
but I think what it comes down to is 
kind of the mentality of the person 

1611
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:00,500
that's training or competing in either 
one of those things,

1612
01:10:00,501 --> 01:10:05,501
you know,
it's like you take somebody and whether 

1613
01:10:05,501 --> 01:10:05,501
they're appoints fighter,
if there are points,

1614
01:10:05,501 --> 01:10:07,670
spider competing in a submission only 
tournament,

1615
01:10:07,730 --> 01:10:12,730
they're going to pretty much see them 
take the same strategy and the 

1616
01:10:12,730 --> 01:10:12,730
submission only toilet.
Um,

1617
01:10:12,730 --> 01:10:13,820
you know,
it's,

1618
01:10:14,090 --> 01:10:19,090
it takes,
it takes guys that are constantly 

1619
01:10:19,090 --> 01:10:19,090
hunting for submissions in training.
Um,

1620
01:10:19,090 --> 01:10:23,740
and that's,
that's when you're gonna see the best 

1621
01:10:23,740 --> 01:10:23,740
matches,
you know,

1622
01:10:23,740 --> 01:10:24,290
guys that are constantly hunting after 
submissions all the time.

1623
01:10:24,291 --> 01:10:26,840
It's not just like a situational thing.
There's like this,

1624
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:30,590
there's just this overarching thing that
some of the bigger Jujitsu guys say.

1625
01:10:30,770 --> 01:10:33,720
I think I saw like an article from Kyle 
Taylor and I love dietary,

1626
01:10:33,770 --> 01:10:35,240
you know,
a great guy,

1627
01:10:35,241 --> 01:10:38,240
but he posted this thing that said like,
you know,

1628
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:39,480
Oh,
you know,

1629
01:10:39,490 --> 01:10:40,130
uh,
you know,

1630
01:10:40,140 --> 01:10:42,740
I,
I hate when people talk about submission

1631
01:10:42,741 --> 01:10:45,420
fighters and points fighters and,
and you know,

1632
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:48,940
the difference between the two.
And I think it's like the points fetters

1633
01:10:48,980 --> 01:10:50,210
was,
it's all the same,

1634
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:51,860
you know,
and these guys talk about,

1635
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:57,100
Oh,
I'm going to use my Jujitsu and if a 

1636
01:10:57,100 --> 01:10:57,100
submission opens up,
I'm going to,

1637
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:59,030
I'll finish the guy if the submission 
opens up.

1638
01:10:59,060 --> 01:11:01,310
No,
you make the fucking submission open up.

1639
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:02,600
It's not,
it's not like,

1640
01:11:02,630 --> 01:11:07,630
oh,
I'm waiting for this guy to like 

1641
01:11:07,630 --> 01:11:07,630
accidentally stick his arm out there.
No,

1642
01:11:07,630 --> 01:11:08,360
I make them,
I take his arm away from him.

1643
01:11:08,450 --> 01:11:09,920
That's the point,
you know,

1644
01:11:09,980 --> 01:11:11,390
uh,
there's two complete.

1645
01:11:11,420 --> 01:11:13,340
Those are two different mentalities,
you know,

1646
01:11:13,370 --> 01:11:13,680
I mean,
oh,

1647
01:11:13,681 --> 01:11:18,681
I'm going to wait for this guy to make a
mistake and I'm going to make this guy 

1648
01:11:18,681 --> 01:11:18,681
in danger.

1649
01:11:18,681 --> 01:11:19,410
That's a newer mentality,
right?

1650
01:11:19,411 --> 01:11:24,411
Because the original mentality was like 
one of the reasons why I would favor a 

1651
01:11:24,411 --> 01:11:25,590
longer matches,
you wanted to cook his opponent and want

1652
01:11:25,591 --> 01:11:27,480
to slow them down,
wanting to make them make mistakes,

1653
01:11:27,670 --> 01:11:30,600
didn't have the physicality to impose 
himself on people.

1654
01:11:30,890 --> 01:11:34,800
So he waited until they got tired and 
then they would give something up and it

1655
01:11:34,801 --> 01:11:35,760
can work.
Sure.

1656
01:11:35,761 --> 01:11:37,920
And I don't think it's not a winning 
strategy.

1657
01:11:37,921 --> 01:11:40,580
You can see clearly you see guys grind 
people out them.

1658
01:11:41,550 --> 01:11:44,640
But I think that,
I think that not just using strength,

1659
01:11:44,670 --> 01:11:46,020
you can find ways to,
you know,

1660
01:11:46,021 --> 01:11:47,420
open up submissions on people.
It's,

1661
01:11:47,470 --> 01:11:52,470
it's,
there's definitely a deeper level of 

1662
01:11:52,470 --> 01:11:52,470
technique there.
Yeah.

1663
01:11:52,470 --> 01:11:53,490
That's why the difference between the 
way Josh Barnett describes it,

1664
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:55,740
you know,
describe submissions in the way,

1665
01:11:55,741 --> 01:12:00,030
like some more technical jujitsu based 
guys would describe submissions.

1666
01:12:00,050 --> 01:12:00,200
Yeah.

1667
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:02,650
Like Barnett always calls like catch 
wrestling,

1668
01:12:02,651 --> 01:12:04,810
like a violent art that elect your,
your,

1669
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:10,100
your attack.
It's not the gentle art to just use a 

1670
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:10,100
general art catch wrestling,
the violent art.

1671
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:12,620
So these,
a lot of the young guys like yourself,

1672
01:12:12,670 --> 01:12:14,880
super aggressive gods.
There's like,

1673
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:19,590
there's like a change in philosophy then
more adherent to that philosophy,

1674
01:12:19,591 --> 01:12:21,750
like the aggressive go after it.
Philosophy.

1675
01:12:21,870 --> 01:12:26,870
Yeah,
and I think when we're talking about 

1676
01:12:26,870 --> 01:12:26,870
taking grappling to a point where it's a
spectator sport,

1677
01:12:26,870 --> 01:12:28,500
which is what Eddie's trying to do in 
many of these other organizations,

1678
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:31,050
that's what needs to happen.
Whether it's,

1679
01:12:31,230 --> 01:12:33,710
whether it's going to help you win 
fights or not.

1680
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:38,720
Like you know,
you take a look at the UFC and Dana 

1681
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:38,720
White's always telling people like you 
have to have exciting fights,

1682
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:41,280
you have to have exciting fights and 
it's true because you won't have as many

1683
01:12:41,281 --> 01:12:44,160
fans if you don't heal eventually kick 
you out of the UFC if you don't.

1684
01:12:44,330 --> 01:12:46,320
You know what I mean?
But that's what makes it a Spec it.

1685
01:12:46,350 --> 01:12:51,350
That's why people get paid to do it 
because people are excited to watch it 

1686
01:12:51,350 --> 01:12:53,190
and whether you win or lose,
it can't be the only thing in your head.

1687
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:58,600
I'm at that point.
If when we're talking about bringing 

1688
01:12:58,600 --> 01:12:58,600
people in,
if you're making money,

1689
01:12:58,600 --> 01:12:59,820
you're putting on a performance,
you know,

1690
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,000
so it has to be about the attacks.
It has to be about what's exciting about

1691
01:13:03,001 --> 01:13:04,320
Jujitsu,
the submission,

1692
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:06,900
you know what I mean?
So people constantly getting attacked.

1693
01:13:06,930 --> 01:13:09,840
That's what people want to see.
And that's going to make this like a big

1694
01:13:09,841 --> 01:13:12,840
thing that people are interested in.
Are you still interested in competing in

1695
01:13:12,841 --> 01:13:15,190
the GE or you're just doing.
I'm also competing against.

1696
01:13:15,230 --> 01:13:18,090
I just don't focus on it because nobody 
pays anybody to compete in the G.

1697
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:19,100
number one,
let them.

1698
01:13:19,110 --> 01:13:20,730
Morris does.
Yeah.

1699
01:13:20,750 --> 01:13:25,750
Most and most of the matches don't ended
the submission and they're considered 

1700
01:13:25,750 --> 01:13:27,310
boring matches the most of them.
I'm not saying all dot matter.

1701
01:13:27,430 --> 01:13:29,760
Metamora should go all Nogi what's,
uh,

1702
01:13:29,761 --> 01:13:30,320
yeah,
I,

1703
01:13:30,321 --> 01:13:30,960
I,
I do.

1704
01:13:30,961 --> 01:13:33,630
Um,
I don't necessarily think that you can't

1705
01:13:33,631 --> 01:13:38,631
have excited matches in the gate.
I just think you have to find the right 

1706
01:13:38,631 --> 01:13:41,421
people.
You have to find two people that are 

1707
01:13:41,421 --> 01:13:43,371
willing to put it all on the line and 
just try to submit each other and not 

1708
01:13:43,371 --> 01:13:43,371
give a shit whether or not they get 
submitted.

1709
01:13:43,371 --> 01:13:45,300
It's hard.
Even when you find people like that,

1710
01:13:45,510 --> 01:13:50,510
when one,
when they both have a grip of the color 

1711
01:13:50,510 --> 01:13:52,680
and the stuck there,
they're really good at just holding each

1712
01:13:52,681 --> 01:13:54,530
other.
It's a,

1713
01:13:54,580 --> 01:13:56,250
it's a tough one.
Yeah.

1714
01:13:56,340 --> 01:13:57,120
No,
I agree.

1715
01:13:57,150 --> 01:13:59,190
I think it just,
it just makes it more exciting,

1716
01:13:59,850 --> 01:14:00,800
more smashing the game.

1717
01:14:01,140 --> 01:14:01,680
Uh,
I,

1718
01:14:01,860 --> 01:14:04,500
I'd consider it,
but it would take out a bigger camp,

1719
01:14:04,590 --> 01:14:05,460
you know?
Uh,

1720
01:14:05,610 --> 01:14:06,630
I definitely,
uh,

1721
01:14:07,230 --> 01:14:10,200
I'm definitely just focused on Nogi 
right now for everything in my future.

1722
01:14:10,201 --> 01:14:12,010
It's just like you,
if I'm going to do MNA,

1723
01:14:12,011 --> 01:14:13,500
it only makes sense.
Um,

1724
01:14:13,990 --> 01:14:18,990
every match,
every super fight that I'm being asked 

1725
01:14:18,990 --> 01:14:18,990
to do is without the gate.
It just literally at this point makes no

1726
01:14:18,990 --> 01:14:20,470
sense for me to spend a lot of time on 
it.

1727
01:14:20,471 --> 01:14:21,520
Now,
once again,

1728
01:14:21,521 --> 01:14:23,710
like I said before,
from an instructional standpoint,

1729
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,130
your students that might be interested 
in training and the gate at some point.

1730
01:14:27,131 --> 01:14:29,140
Once I break away from,
you know,

1731
01:14:29,230 --> 01:14:31,840
my athletic career,
I'll definitely study the geo.

1732
01:14:31,850 --> 01:14:35,020
Definitely studied judo,
definitely study all the things that,

1733
01:14:35,660 --> 01:14:37,780
those little intricacies that people use
in Jujitsu,

1734
01:14:37,781 --> 01:14:40,450
the lapel guards and things like that.
So that I can better help my students,

1735
01:14:40,451 --> 01:14:42,880
but not so much for me as a professional
athlete.

1736
01:14:42,910 --> 01:14:47,910
I don't think.
I think at this point we're hitting a 

1737
01:14:47,910 --> 01:14:47,910
point in Jujitsu where you have to make 
a decision.

1738
01:14:47,910 --> 01:14:50,220
What am I going to specialize in?
And uh,

1739
01:14:50,240 --> 01:14:52,630
I think I'm going to specialize in Nogi 
submission,

1740
01:14:52,631 --> 01:14:57,631
grappling with Marcello.
I've never rolled with Marcello 

1741
01:14:57,631 --> 01:14:57,820
recently.
He's been,

1742
01:14:57,850 --> 01:14:58,560
uh,
you know,

1743
01:14:58,630 --> 01:15:03,630
he's been injured.
I think he's coming back now pretty 

1744
01:15:03,630 --> 01:15:05,200
strong from what happened to him.
He got his knee hurt doing something.

1745
01:15:05,230 --> 01:15:07,630
I'm not a hundred percent sure what,
maybe snowboarding.

1746
01:15:08,410 --> 01:15:09,100
Yeah,
exactly.

1747
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:10,780
Perfect.
Perfect.

1748
01:15:10,870 --> 01:15:14,470
He loves really.
It's awesome dude.

1749
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:15,500
Once you will,
eventually you'll,

1750
01:15:15,670 --> 01:15:16,440
you'll,
you'll do it.

1751
01:15:16,540 --> 01:15:17,900
I've been skiing.
It's,

1752
01:15:18,330 --> 01:15:19,970
it's different when you're going 
sideways.

1753
01:15:20,030 --> 01:15:22,780
Was it different?
It's first of all to better.

1754
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:24,010
It's,
it's,

1755
01:15:24,011 --> 01:15:25,820
uh,
it's better really.

1756
01:15:25,930 --> 01:15:28,520
Once you go snowboarding for years,
you don't go back.

1757
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:32,180
For years I was snowboarding like when I
was like back to guy was like,

1758
01:15:32,410 --> 01:15:35,130
I was skiing for losers on the 
snowboard.

1759
01:15:35,130 --> 01:15:38,380
Snowboard is so much cooler.
So I do it for like four or five years,

1760
01:15:38,381 --> 01:15:39,050
just like,
you know,

1761
01:15:39,070 --> 01:15:40,150
once a year,
twice a year,

1762
01:15:40,151 --> 01:15:41,680
you know,
family would go on trips or whatever.

1763
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:44,050
And then one year my friends like,
dude,

1764
01:15:44,051 --> 01:15:46,240
you gotta try out scheme,
you know,

1765
01:15:46,241 --> 01:15:51,241
see how you see how you.
Like now at snowboarding I was at a 

1766
01:15:51,241 --> 01:15:51,580
level,
this is my strategy snowboarding as fast

1767
01:15:51,581 --> 01:15:56,581
as I possibly fucking could in a 
straight line going down the hill and 

1768
01:15:56,581 --> 01:15:57,340
then fall to stop myself.
Alright.

1769
01:15:57,490 --> 01:15:59,460
Sounds like getting almost knocked out,
you know,

1770
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:01,410
falling into the snow.
How fast are you going?

1771
01:16:01,411 --> 01:16:03,400
I have no idea.
Who knows?

1772
01:16:03,490 --> 01:16:04,900
And I'm only going like,
you know,

1773
01:16:04,930 --> 01:16:06,360
bunny slopes or like,
you know,

1774
01:16:06,530 --> 01:16:07,450
blue,
whatever,

1775
01:16:07,451 --> 01:16:09,280
the blue squares,
intermediate,

1776
01:16:09,281 --> 01:16:14,281
whatever I could never do.
I was fearful of a black black diamonds 

1777
01:16:14,281 --> 01:16:15,070
straight down I saw put on skis.

1778
01:16:15,160 --> 01:16:17,890
I put on skis the first time I try it.
Black diamond,

1779
01:16:17,891 --> 01:16:19,090
no problem.
You know what I mean?

1780
01:16:19,091 --> 01:16:20,050
It's like it,
it's,

1781
01:16:20,110 --> 01:16:21,910
I mean clearly you're not doing it 
technically,

1782
01:16:22,180 --> 01:16:23,920
but like it's safe.
You know what I mean?

1783
01:16:23,921 --> 01:16:25,480
I could,
I felt like comfortable,

1784
01:16:25,481 --> 01:16:30,481
like at slow myself down snowboarding.
I just feel like you're looking in one 

1785
01:16:30,481 --> 01:16:30,520
direction.
It's just tunnel vision.

1786
01:16:30,521 --> 01:16:32,350
You're going as fast as you can.
It's so.

1787
01:16:33,340 --> 01:16:35,800
It's so much more.
Uncontrolled is difficult.

1788
01:16:35,860 --> 01:16:38,200
So what you're saying is snowboarding is
more exciting.

1789
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:41,170
I think there for a thrill seeking point
of view.

1790
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:43,600
Hell yeah.
It feels more dangerous to me.

1791
01:16:43,601 --> 01:16:48,601
You're locked into this board.
You don't have your two legs to be able 

1792
01:16:48,601 --> 01:16:51,421
to separate and balance there.
So often the snowboarders collide with 

1793
01:16:51,421 --> 01:16:54,601
each other if you're going that fast.
When I'm on the slopes is the high much 

1794
01:16:54,601 --> 01:16:58,900
higher percentage than everybody else,
but you just got to learn to turn inside

1795
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:02,380
because really snowboarding and skiing 
is just the art of slowing down,

1796
01:17:02,650 --> 01:17:03,490
brake,
brake,

1797
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:08,640
brake and slowing down and slowing down.
Slowing down because as soon as you 

1798
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:08,640
don't slow down,
boom,

1799
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:10,220
you go down like a Ronnie Bono.

1800
01:17:13,490 --> 01:17:14,740
Oh,
back to Marcello.

1801
01:17:14,750 --> 01:17:16,610
He.
What would he be?

1802
01:17:16,611 --> 01:17:20,600
Someone that I think personally has a 
Jujitsu fan you against Marsala would be

1803
01:17:20,810 --> 01:17:23,430
the most interesting.
Like if that was metamorris yeah,

1804
01:17:23,660 --> 01:17:25,610
Jesus.
I would never superfight Ebi.

1805
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:27,290
Yeah,
we'd never call them out or anything.

1806
01:17:27,291 --> 01:17:32,291
You just don't have any right to,
but I'm not going to be an amazing 

1807
01:17:32,291 --> 01:17:32,291
match.
I love that matchup.

1808
01:17:32,291 --> 01:17:34,190
I'm rematch with chrome.
Absolutely.

1809
01:17:34,191 --> 01:17:35,780
I asked for it all the time,
but again,

1810
01:17:35,781 --> 01:17:38,260
I can't really call crone out.
He beat me so I,

1811
01:17:38,261 --> 01:17:39,590
you know,
I called them out in a sense like,

1812
01:17:39,630 --> 01:17:40,430
hey,
I want to fight you,

1813
01:17:40,431 --> 01:17:45,431
but I would never talk shit about chrome
to try and get them to fight me because 

1814
01:17:45,431 --> 01:17:45,431
it's just not.
That's not fair.

1815
01:17:45,431 --> 01:17:45,470
Like what do you mean

1816
01:17:45,790 --> 01:17:50,790
made that match was the finish that made
that match and it made the match for 

1817
01:17:50,790 --> 01:17:50,790
both of you.
It's,

1818
01:17:50,790 --> 01:17:54,190
it's like it made the match so much more
exciting than if you guys just went to a

1819
01:17:54,191 --> 01:17:59,191
draw.
If you went to a stalemate at the end 

1820
01:17:59,191 --> 01:18:01,580
and maybe you know,
you were both clenched up with each 

1821
01:18:01,580 --> 01:18:01,580
other and it ended,
that would've not been as good with.

1822
01:18:01,580 --> 01:18:04,990
That was a perfect example of what's 
possible at high level Jujitsu.

1823
01:18:05,350 --> 01:18:06,220
So exciting.

1824
01:18:06,410 --> 01:18:09,140
The fact that he did submit,
you blew up.

1825
01:18:09,240 --> 01:18:09,660
Yeah.

1826
01:18:11,220 --> 01:18:13,350
You put him in some terrible positions,
man.

1827
01:18:13,351 --> 01:18:16,260
I mean you,
you had him in some bad spots.

1828
01:18:16,460 --> 01:18:18,030
We were like,
Holy Shit.

1829
01:18:18,630 --> 01:18:20,360
And you know,
Eddie and I went off about it.

1830
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:22,700
We watched the video.
We was there alive.

1831
01:18:22,780 --> 01:18:23,000
Yeah,

1832
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:24,710
that's right.
I was like,

1833
01:18:24,740 --> 01:18:25,830
we were all crying.
Oh,

1834
01:18:26,270 --> 01:18:29,170
is he gonna beat crone.
Oh,

1835
01:18:29,540 --> 01:18:32,740
and then one minute left,
it was chrome.

1836
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:35,000
They broke you guys up.
He looked at Hixson.

1837
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:36,700
Does a video of you explaining

1838
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:40,250
Gary and then we play the video of the 
fight on the Internet.

1839
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:41,990
It's on youtube.
Yeah,

1840
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:43,390
yeah.
Yeah.

1841
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:45,530
So it's,
it's cool that like,

1842
01:18:45,531 --> 01:18:49,250
something like that exists and I just 
think that we need to have more of those

1843
01:18:49,251 --> 01:18:51,190
out there.
And then eventually Hollywood people are

1844
01:18:51,191 --> 01:18:51,860
going to go,
hey,

1845
01:18:51,861 --> 01:18:52,220
whoa,
whoa,

1846
01:18:52,230 --> 01:18:52,760
whoa.
What is.

1847
01:18:52,761 --> 01:18:54,200
This is wild shit.
Hold on.

1848
01:18:54,410 --> 01:18:56,480
Nobody.
Nobody has this locked down.

1849
01:18:56,481 --> 01:19:01,481
This isn't on television for the UFC has
established a very firm like huge 

1850
01:19:01,481 --> 01:19:04,010
property in the UFC.
Like that's what everybody connects with

1851
01:19:04,011 --> 01:19:09,011
mma.
MMA equals UFC and if you're fighting 

1852
01:19:09,011 --> 01:19:09,011
for Bella tour,
they go,

1853
01:19:09,011 --> 01:19:12,700
oh wow.
So you're going to be fight for the UFC 

1854
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:12,700
someday.
Like it just what it is.

1855
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:13,700
There's none of that with grappling.
It doesn't exist.

1856
01:19:13,701 --> 01:19:13,840
Right?

1857
01:19:14,330 --> 01:19:16,340
How many times have you heard a guy 
trying to?

1858
01:19:16,490 --> 01:19:17,810
2,000,
2000.

1859
01:19:17,811 --> 01:19:18,680
One,
2000.

1860
01:19:18,681 --> 01:19:23,681
Two guys that were already deeply into 
the UFC was we saw a 93.

1861
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:25,340
It's 2000,
2001.

1862
01:19:25,370 --> 01:19:30,370
Even to this day.
You run into guys that aren't into it 

1863
01:19:30,370 --> 01:19:32,350
and they've seen it a couple times.
Just a couple dudes rolling around.

1864
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:33,680
I was like,
uneventful for them.

1865
01:19:33,681 --> 01:19:36,460
For them it was uneventful,
but when we saw it,

1866
01:19:36,620 --> 01:19:38,120
what did we see?
What was the difference?

1867
01:19:38,180 --> 01:19:40,130
The difference was the fucking 
tournament.

1868
01:19:40,190 --> 01:19:45,190
The first one I saw was UFC two and that
was $60 tournament because it ends up 

1869
01:19:45,801 --> 01:19:47,660
being.
When you see one match at a time,

1870
01:19:47,661 --> 01:19:52,661
it's like a documentary.
You see maybe that first round you 

1871
01:19:52,661 --> 01:19:52,730
don't,
you don't know one looks familiar,

1872
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:54,500
but that second round you're like,
oh shit,

1873
01:19:54,501 --> 01:19:56,990
that dude with the long hair against.
That's the Ninja Dude.

1874
01:19:57,170 --> 01:19:59,720
And then the semifinals,
or you're like,

1875
01:19:59,721 --> 01:20:01,340
Holy Shit,
how's that?

1876
01:20:01,340 --> 01:20:04,040
Gonna work out.
You just saw their career that night and

1877
01:20:04,041 --> 01:20:05,690
then the finals,
holy Saint,

1878
01:20:05,740 --> 01:20:06,920
Patrick Smith.
You're like,

1879
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:10,170
Holy Shit.
I went from hating hoists in the opening

1880
01:20:10,171 --> 01:20:15,171
round because he beat my karate guys,
rooting for him and just being as 

1881
01:20:15,171 --> 01:20:16,380
follower right there at that final,
because I.

1882
01:20:16,390 --> 01:20:17,920
Pat Smith was kind of a,
you know,

1883
01:20:17,930 --> 01:20:21,240
he was like a heel even within that.
So it was a movie.

1884
01:20:21,330 --> 01:20:26,330
That's why we got to work with the 
people that watch it back then got 

1885
01:20:26,330 --> 01:20:29,340
obsessed with it instantly.
It was the greatest thing ever.

1886
01:20:29,430 --> 01:20:32,130
If they would have been single matches 
and you didn't know those dudes,

1887
01:20:32,490 --> 01:20:36,060
it would probably would.
We wouldn't have that drama unfold.

1888
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:38,710
There's just be a bunch of single 
matches so you can't.

1889
01:20:39,570 --> 01:20:42,600
Exactly.
And you can't do that with mma,

1890
01:20:42,660 --> 01:20:45,090
but you can totally do that.
Would you did too.

1891
01:20:45,091 --> 01:20:50,091
And that's why Abu Dhabi is so special 
because it's a bunch of 16 man brackets 

1892
01:20:50,091 --> 01:20:54,500
supervised,
but the only thing that I think Abu 

1893
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:54,870
Dhabi should have a $60 bracket habit,
like four days,

1894
01:20:54,871 --> 01:20:55,560
like a whole week.

1895
01:20:55,670 --> 01:20:57,900
What?
Every day is a different one because the

1896
01:20:57,901 --> 01:21:01,470
way they do it now it's like it's like 
watching three movies at the same time.

1897
01:21:01,620 --> 01:21:05,730
You're not watching it unfold and then 
on the Internet you just watch a link of

1898
01:21:05,731 --> 01:21:07,950
the finals and then you go back and 
watch a semifinal.

1899
01:21:08,030 --> 01:21:10,740
You don't.
It's like watching a movie in pieces and

1900
01:21:10,741 --> 01:21:15,741
you already know the ending,
but what what metamorris does is have a 

1901
01:21:15,741 --> 01:21:18,720
single fight.
Every fight is his main stage.

1902
01:21:18,721 --> 01:21:21,160
There's three matches or 12 matches,
like the moon deals.

1903
01:21:21,330 --> 01:21:25,230
It's one match at a time showcase,
but it's not a tournament style.

1904
01:21:25,231 --> 01:21:30,231
So.
So what I'm trying to do is I took the 

1905
01:21:30,231 --> 01:21:32,811
best from Abu Dhabi and the best from 
metamorris and try to combine it 

1906
01:21:32,811 --> 01:21:34,260
metamorris submission only one match out
of time.

1907
01:21:34,650 --> 01:21:39,650
And Abu Dhabi,
the super 16 man brackets that are in 

1908
01:21:39,650 --> 01:21:40,350
themselves,
if you watch it one by one,

1909
01:21:40,650 --> 01:21:43,630
one at a time center stage,
it's mindblowing.

1910
01:21:43,740 --> 01:21:46,410
When you watch it like that,
we need to watch it like that.

1911
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:49,380
In my opinion.
That's what made Ebi Ebi too,

1912
01:21:49,381 --> 01:21:52,770
which I mean Gary went and submitted 
everybody in that 16 man bracket.

1913
01:21:52,830 --> 01:21:55,980
Every dude he ran through and in the 
final,

1914
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:57,930
by the time we got to the final with him
and Richie,

1915
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:00,390
Richie blew through everybody on his end
of the bracket,

1916
01:22:00,391 --> 01:22:01,990
so it was Richie and Gary.
The.

1917
01:22:02,460 --> 01:22:05,940
Everyone was going nuts because they saw
it unfold one at a time.

1918
01:22:06,090 --> 01:22:07,500
That's the secret,
right?

1919
01:22:07,501 --> 01:22:08,820
That's a very good point.
You know,

1920
01:22:09,210 --> 01:22:11,550
they're trying to do that with glory and
I am actually.

1921
01:22:11,551 --> 01:22:16,551
I've been advising people against it.
I think it's a terrible idea for 

1922
01:22:16,551 --> 01:22:17,690
kickboxing and too much data,
too much damage.

1923
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:20,970
People going to get hurt for cut.
It's not going to want to get Kayo.

1924
01:22:20,971 --> 01:22:25,971
That's the problem you get sometimes you
get killed and you still fighting when 

1925
01:22:25,971 --> 01:22:29,960
you know you get,
you get knocked out and you're still 

1926
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:29,960
fighting on autopilot and then it's over
like what happened?

1927
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:34,250
You want,
you want a decision like what I've seen 

1928
01:22:34,250 --> 01:22:34,250
that happen with guys,
it's not say Gloria,

1929
01:22:34,250 --> 01:22:38,961
they fought three times.
They had the last man standing 

1930
01:22:38,961 --> 01:22:38,961
tournament in La.
We went to that right.

1931
01:22:38,961 --> 01:22:39,390
You can do that,
that should.

1932
01:22:39,450 --> 01:22:44,450
They fought three fucking times,
man box and the first fight Joe 

1933
01:22:44,450 --> 01:22:48,950
Schilling had to fight for rounds 
because the third after the third round 

1934
01:22:48,950 --> 01:22:51,420
was a draw.
That's how powerful tournament's on when

1935
01:22:51,421 --> 01:22:56,421
you watch it,
it's so powerful that you might not be 

1936
01:22:56,421 --> 01:22:56,670
able to do on kickboxing is all this 
shit could go wrong.

1937
01:22:56,700 --> 01:22:58,170
It's root,
it's risky,

1938
01:22:58,290 --> 01:23:03,290
but the tournament is so exciting that 
if we could pull this off and no one 

1939
01:23:03,290 --> 01:23:07,311
gets hurt and we get lucky,
it's a grand show that people are going 

1940
01:23:07,311 --> 01:23:08,530
to watch over and and when you watch it 
from the beginning to end,

1941
01:23:08,650 --> 01:23:10,150
you feel it.
It's a documentary.

1942
01:23:10,150 --> 01:23:15,150
That's a very good point though.
That's a very good point and I think if 

1943
01:23:15,150 --> 01:23:18,390
someone got ahold of that,
someone who produces sports television 

1944
01:23:18,390 --> 01:23:20,500
and realize that this is like an unsung 
property like this is out there.

1945
01:23:20,590 --> 01:23:22,570
The sport is at a very high level right 
now.

1946
01:23:22,571 --> 01:23:25,240
Guys are very,
very exciting and no one has capitalized

1947
01:23:25,241 --> 01:23:30,241
on it.
No one's put it on television and no 

1948
01:23:30,241 --> 01:23:30,241
one's making money with it,
but they just don't know.

1949
01:23:30,241 --> 01:23:30,880
They just don't know how to do it for.
First of all,

1950
01:23:30,881 --> 01:23:34,060
you got to get rid of the points.
Know I put together Ebi,

1951
01:23:34,150 --> 01:23:37,270
like if some old Jewish guy who owned 
some network said,

1952
01:23:37,271 --> 01:23:38,830
I don't know about this martial art 
stuff,

1953
01:23:38,831 --> 01:23:41,020
but I like your kid.
I'm going to give you one season.

1954
01:23:41,300 --> 01:23:43,390
I don't know about no Jujitsu or 
anything.

1955
01:23:43,540 --> 01:23:44,650
I'm going to give you one season.

1956
01:23:44,650 --> 01:23:46,480
As soon as the ratings drop,
it's out.

1957
01:23:46,481 --> 01:23:48,250
We got a deal.
Then you would go,

1958
01:23:48,251 --> 01:23:49,090
oh shit,
okay.

1959
01:23:49,210 --> 01:23:50,990
We got to get rid of the fucking game we
got.

1960
01:23:51,310 --> 01:23:54,850
We got to get rid of the points and we 
got to have a tournament.

1961
01:23:55,090 --> 01:24:00,090
You've got to see it unfold because 
that's what makes the ultimate fighter 

1962
01:24:00,090 --> 01:24:00,640
so awesome.
It's at the tournament,

1963
01:24:00,700 --> 01:24:02,950
although it doesn't happen in one day,
but it's still a tournament.

1964
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:06,490
You see the brackets unfolding just like
the march madness.

1965
01:24:06,491 --> 01:24:11,491
I hate basketball,
but I understand why there's 

1966
01:24:11,491 --> 01:24:11,580
tournaments.
You see it all unfolding.

1967
01:24:11,590 --> 01:24:13,190
You see the drama,
you know,

1968
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:18,200
and,
and that is what's missing from 

1969
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:18,200
grappling.
That's why,

1970
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:21,780
in my opinion,
that's why you can't get it on tv 

1971
01:24:21,780 --> 01:24:21,970
because in all the other formats,
it's just too much stalling,

1972
01:24:21,971 --> 01:24:26,470
too much holding.
We need right now to dispute your claims

1973
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:28,480
because right now you're talking crazy.

1974
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:33,480
Disrespectful,
so about biggie.

1975
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:39,170
There is no live.
Let no let go.

1976
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:41,350
Let go.
I think that's one of his quotes.

1977
01:24:41,351 --> 01:24:44,710
There's nothing funnier than Brazilian 
misinterpretations of English.

1978
01:24:45,620 --> 01:24:48,460
I said Eddie,
a picture of a tee shirt that I've found

1979
01:24:48,461 --> 01:24:52,270
in my closet way back in the day of 
Waleed Ish.

1980
01:24:52,271 --> 01:24:54,010
My leg t shirt.
Yeah.

1981
01:24:54,030 --> 01:24:59,030
What the fuck did it say on it?
It said on the back there's a cartoon 

1982
01:24:59,030 --> 01:24:59,980
picture.
Him being always on me and he's like,

1983
01:25:00,160 --> 01:25:02,370
he's actually the nicest,
sweetest guy in the sky.

1984
01:25:02,380 --> 01:25:05,590
All those mean looks.
It's all him doing pro wrestling.

1985
01:25:05,830 --> 01:25:08,050
He's actually super sweet,
Super Nice.

1986
01:25:08,230 --> 01:25:10,420
He'll take a picture and then he'll be 
like a little kid.

1987
01:25:11,620 --> 01:25:15,360
He'll look at his picture.
A classic one back in late,

1988
01:25:15,361 --> 01:25:16,730
2004,
2003.

1989
01:25:16,731 --> 01:25:21,731
I love that dude.
He has a shirt where it's him standing 

1990
01:25:23,021 --> 01:25:25,990
there like in a cartoon character and it
says on the top,

1991
01:25:26,020 --> 01:25:27,910
don't be coward.

1992
01:25:28,660 --> 01:25:31,570
Don't run from them.
Don't run off the fight.

1993
01:25:31,571 --> 01:25:33,190
Yes,
don't be coward.

1994
01:25:33,191 --> 01:25:36,750
Don't run off the fight.
Can you imagine?

1995
01:25:37,480 --> 01:25:40,420
Imagine what a.
When he turned in,

1996
01:25:40,450 --> 01:25:42,310
like when he went to the t shirt shop 
place,

1997
01:25:42,490 --> 01:25:45,900
there's an American guy.
It was like,

1998
01:25:46,510 --> 01:25:47,900
this is bullshit.
Put it now.

1999
01:25:48,780 --> 01:25:50,140
Now I can.
Okay,

2000
01:25:50,141 --> 01:25:52,640
we're going to need some initials on 
this right now.

2001
01:25:52,690 --> 01:25:55,600
Initial right there and right there.
It was crazy.

2002
01:25:55,601 --> 01:25:59,190
Let's just use the damn shirt.
I'm trying to find a printing it.

2003
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:00,400
We're like,
boss,

2004
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:02,200
boss,
come here.

2005
01:26:02,201 --> 01:26:04,130
I just want to make sure it says don't 
run off

2006
01:26:04,130 --> 01:26:05,660
the fine.
We'll call it that.

2007
01:26:06,370 --> 01:26:10,080
I'm trying to be coward and he's just 
like,

2008
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:16,800
I just want your approval here and 
initial here and I see he didn't tattoo 

2009
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:18,020
it on himself.
I want to get this out of the way.

2010
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:21,260
Now you Mr.
Smile,

2011
01:26:21,261 --> 01:26:26,261
you realize what you have written here 
and this is exactly how you would like 

2012
01:26:26,261 --> 01:26:26,780
print it.
It goes to court.

2013
01:26:26,810 --> 01:26:31,810
You know what I mean?
To do a selfie video that I'm trying to 

2014
01:26:31,810 --> 01:26:33,740
find the picture I know and claims that 
they fucked up.

2015
01:26:34,310 --> 01:26:36,380
Yeah.
This is not the true Jujitsu.

2016
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:40,390
I never say run off.
Run off the stupid.

2017
01:26:40,910 --> 01:26:44,000
Doesn't even make sense.
Yeah.

2018
01:26:44,001 --> 01:26:49,001
He was a.
That was a crazy match with him and 

2019
01:26:49,001 --> 01:26:49,001
hoists.
Remember that shit on the beach in Rio.

2020
01:26:49,001 --> 01:26:51,380
They fought like with Matt,
so were laid out in the sand.

2021
01:26:51,730 --> 01:26:54,230
Everybody got sand in their eyes and 
their face.

2022
01:26:54,230 --> 01:26:59,230
There's fucking sand everywhere.
They slapped him some mats down on the 

2023
01:26:59,230 --> 01:27:02,261
bed.
She always had big balls to take that 

2024
01:27:02,261 --> 01:27:04,560
because while lead was fucking everyone 
up back then and while lead he got him 

2025
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:05,330
in a clock choke,
put them to sleep.

2026
01:27:05,460 --> 01:27:07,340
That's right.
That's a weird thing to watch too.

2027
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:09,110
I can't believe they let him take that 
bike.

2028
01:27:09,111 --> 01:27:14,111
Is Jen the general consensus in like 
late like after the UFC around like how 

2029
01:27:15,890 --> 01:27:20,890
good is hoist Jujitsu for real and he 
was never like a world champion or a 

2030
01:27:21,591 --> 01:27:23,900
national champion or anything like that.
Everybody knew that.

2031
01:27:23,901 --> 01:27:26,090
Everyone knew his.
He had decent Jujitsu.

2032
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:31,120
He wasn't lighting the world on fire.
So for him to take a vow that volleyball

2033
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:35,360
match man that showed he had gigantic 
balls because volleyed was a destroyer.

2034
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:37,430
Yeah.
That's a hugely ballsy move.

2035
01:27:37,490 --> 01:27:39,770
And you know,
he got choked asleep,

2036
01:27:39,830 --> 01:27:43,970
which I think was very important for 
Jujitsu just to show like you.

2037
01:27:43,970 --> 01:27:45,380
Everyone looked at hoists.
Gracie,

2038
01:27:45,410 --> 01:27:48,140
rightly so as this massive innovator,
this,

2039
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:53,160
this pioneer of Jujitsu and mma I heroes
was after the UFC gets choked out.

2040
01:27:53,290 --> 01:27:53,880
Yeah.
Yeah.

2041
01:27:54,390 --> 01:27:57,440
He's a hero of Jujitsu and then you go,
okay,

2042
01:27:57,441 --> 01:28:02,441
well listen,
there's guys out there that are another 

2043
01:28:02,441 --> 01:28:02,441
level,
another level above him,

2044
01:28:02,441 --> 01:28:03,470
you know,
and this is one of them.

2045
01:28:03,530 --> 01:28:04,850
Well that's what he said about Hicks.
And he said,

2046
01:28:04,851 --> 01:28:09,851
well,
I'm not actually that good Hickson's 10 

2047
01:28:09,851 --> 01:28:09,851
times better than me.
And then the Japanese went,

2048
01:28:09,851 --> 01:28:09,851
oh,
okay.

2049
01:28:09,851 --> 01:28:10,540
You sure?
Okay.

2050
01:28:11,180 --> 01:28:14,690
Do you have his number?
I found that it's not a cartoon cartoon.

2051
01:28:15,310 --> 01:28:17,120
I found it.
It's actually a picture of him.

2052
01:28:17,540 --> 01:28:20,210
I thought it was a cartoon,
but we had more than one eddie.

2053
01:28:20,240 --> 01:28:21,950
There was more than one.
No,

2054
01:28:21,951 --> 01:28:22,250
no,
no.

2055
01:28:22,251 --> 01:28:24,220
This is the front.
The back.

2056
01:28:24,280 --> 01:28:26,630
You need the back of the bag of it as a 
card.

2057
01:28:26,631 --> 01:28:27,230
Okay.
Let me see.

2058
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:28,700
No mercy,
no rules,

2059
01:28:28,701 --> 01:28:33,560
no pain.
This is a different one then man.

2060
01:28:33,561 --> 01:28:35,390
This is the one that things don't go 
together.

2061
01:28:35,450 --> 01:28:37,820
I have the same shirt on the back.
One hundred percent.

2062
01:28:37,821 --> 01:28:38,750
I haven't him.
He's in.

2063
01:28:38,810 --> 01:28:42,920
He's in cartoon form two and the bad.
All yoked and shit.

2064
01:28:42,950 --> 01:28:45,620
There was definitely more than one of 
those ridiculous shirts though,

2065
01:28:46,010 --> 01:28:49,470
but that's why a those is so funny 
because you know,

2066
01:28:49,870 --> 01:28:54,870
if you think that he's actually being 
conservative and not those kind of 

2067
01:28:54,870 --> 01:28:55,640
conservative with his language.
He's a.

2068
01:28:57,040 --> 01:29:01,350
he's not a stick man.
He's a real motherfucker schick shtick

2069
01:29:02,310 --> 01:29:04,960
as the stick.
I say no,

2070
01:29:04,980 --> 01:29:05,310
no,
no.

2071
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:09,930
Stick.
It's like his act out a lot.

2072
01:29:11,090 --> 01:29:13,740
He's actually that cocky in real life.
People think amazing.

2073
01:29:13,950 --> 01:29:16,220
It's super confident guy.
No,

2074
01:29:16,230 --> 01:29:21,230
he really is like that.
Would you be willing to match him with 

2075
01:29:21,230 --> 01:29:21,230
the game?
Because the game is his strong suit.

2076
01:29:21,510 --> 01:29:26,510
I wouldn't.
I never said anything bad about him and 

2077
01:29:26,510 --> 01:29:26,510
he's always been nice to me.
Fuck it.

2078
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:31,260
No comment.
He's scared the videos when Nate Diaz is

2079
01:29:31,261 --> 01:29:33,170
taking it serious?
Yeah.

2080
01:29:33,470 --> 01:29:34,680
Yeah.
Oh my God.

2081
01:29:35,490 --> 01:29:40,490
Fuck man.
The first time I met him it was a joke 

2082
01:29:40,490 --> 01:29:40,560
either.
Not a joke.

2083
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:42,210
He's,
he's really that arrogant.

2084
01:29:42,380 --> 01:29:44,510
It everyone thinks he's just pretending 
to be arrogant.

2085
01:29:44,550 --> 01:29:45,900
He was doing,
she was doing.

2086
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:51,690
I'm showing my respect because his 
passport has specked.

2087
01:29:51,980 --> 01:29:55,260
So you said,
you said that someone was thinking about

2088
01:29:55,290 --> 01:29:57,690
trying to turn submission grappling into
a television show,

2089
01:29:57,691 --> 01:29:58,470
like who's trying to do it?

2090
01:29:58,680 --> 01:29:59,290
Oh No,
no,

2091
01:29:59,300 --> 01:30:04,300
no.
I was just saying that people were 

2092
01:30:04,300 --> 01:30:06,051
trying to be trying to be like the UFC 
and the way that you were talking about 

2093
01:30:06,051 --> 01:30:07,290
how somebody be fighting in Beltour.
It's like,

2094
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:09,480
Oh yeah,
when are you going to be in UFC?

2095
01:30:09,780 --> 01:30:11,410
People are trying to do that.
Um,

2096
01:30:11,850 --> 01:30:16,850
I've had multiple organizations now 
asked me to be exclusive to their 

2097
01:30:16,850 --> 01:30:18,130
organization for competing.
Yup.

2098
01:30:19,290 --> 01:30:21,450
Yup.
So much.

2099
01:30:21,451 --> 01:30:23,280
No,
sounds terrible.

2100
01:30:23,281 --> 01:30:27,450
If they pay enough cash or enough money.
I don't know about all that.

2101
01:30:27,451 --> 01:30:28,120
Man.
I,

2102
01:30:28,150 --> 01:30:29,820
I'm,
I'm in favor of.

2103
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:35,400
Look,
the big issue with with the MMA is in 

2104
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:36,930
the big issue with boxing has always 
been that trying to get the best guys to

2105
01:30:36,931 --> 01:30:39,570
be able to fight the best guys when 
you're exclusive for one promoter,

2106
01:30:39,571 --> 01:30:42,270
exclusive for another promoter and it 
makes things super problematic.

2107
01:30:43,050 --> 01:30:48,050
Independent contracts for independent 
matches and no longterm commitment to 

2108
01:30:48,121 --> 01:30:53,121
things is the smart way to go for 
grapplers because if that gets 

2109
01:30:53,121 --> 01:30:56,601
established as the Goto,
then it favors the grappa and then 

2110
01:30:56,601 --> 01:30:57,780
there's no advantage that the promoter 
has over the grappa.

2111
01:30:57,780 --> 01:30:59,790
The grappa could always find another 
promoter,

2112
01:30:59,940 --> 01:31:00,990
so if the,
if the.

2113
01:31:01,050 --> 01:31:06,050
If the promoters get along with the 
grapplers and everybody agrees with how 

2114
01:31:06,050 --> 01:31:07,650
much money everybody's making and it 
seems cool and fair,

2115
01:31:07,980 --> 01:31:10,050
then that would be a good way to do it.
You know,

2116
01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:13,170
so no one has a lockdown on the market.
I think that's very important.

2117
01:31:13,171 --> 01:31:15,570
They're trying to adjust me to turn down
the offer.

2118
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:16,470
Yeah,
yeah.

2119
01:31:16,610 --> 01:31:17,550
I did.
Good for you,

2120
01:31:17,551 --> 01:31:18,420
man.
Good for you.

2121
01:31:18,421 --> 01:31:21,610
That takes balls and that's a smart 
thing to do because I think if,

2122
01:31:21,640 --> 01:31:26,640
if everybody's just set that precedent 
and we created this market where the 

2123
01:31:27,060 --> 01:31:29,400
grapplers where the star,
like this is what's important.

2124
01:31:29,401 --> 01:31:31,200
If people want to see,
you know,

2125
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:36,400
fill in the blank,
Marcella Garcia versus Gary tone of 

2126
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:37,620
people want to see that match.
The real benefit is of that match.

2127
01:31:37,621 --> 01:31:40,620
The benefactors of that mass should be 
Marcella Garcia and Gary Tonin.

2128
01:31:40,790 --> 01:31:43,530
And then of course some money should go 
to the promoter.

2129
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:44,790
You know,
some money should,

2130
01:31:44,820 --> 01:31:49,820
but it's what's the only thing that's 
exciting about submission grappling is 

2131
01:31:49,820 --> 01:31:51,510
the submission grapplers.
That's it.

2132
01:31:51,570 --> 01:31:53,130
Yep.
Because if you're not selling that,

2133
01:31:53,250 --> 01:31:54,450
you're selling air.
Yep.

2134
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:55,590
That's it.
That's all you got.

2135
01:31:55,620 --> 01:31:58,410
So if you're locked up to one 
organization,

2136
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:00,380
it's also limits.
Matches,

2137
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:05,400
matches.
You can't make it can only do a certain 

2138
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:05,570
number of matches per year.
Right?

2139
01:32:05,620 --> 01:32:10,620
So what,
what organization puts on 12 matches a 

2140
01:32:10,620 --> 01:32:11,860
year right now is the same guy every,
every match.

2141
01:32:12,780 --> 01:32:14,890
What do you say?
I'm sure that the promoter,

2142
01:32:14,891 --> 01:32:16,390
whoever's doing this,
I have no idea.

2143
01:32:16,510 --> 01:32:18,440
I'm sure he's probably saying to 
themselves,

2144
01:32:18,460 --> 01:32:20,860
Hey,
if we want to be as big as the UFC,

2145
01:32:21,610 --> 01:32:23,350
UFC type stuff.
Exactly,

2146
01:32:23,351 --> 01:32:28,351
and it's just such a flawed mentality.
I feel like for the sport doesn't have 

2147
01:32:28,351 --> 01:32:31,360
to be so young and it's so tiny and 
there's very little money.

2148
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:34,360
Every single one of these organizations,
these professional organizations,

2149
01:32:34,361 --> 01:32:35,680
Ebi,
Metamorris,

2150
01:32:35,681 --> 01:32:40,681
Polaris,
all these things that are popping up 

2151
01:32:40,681 --> 01:32:40,681
here and there.
They're all doing amazing things for the

2152
01:32:40,681 --> 01:32:45,451
sport.
They're broadening the audience for 

2153
01:32:45,451 --> 01:32:47,221
submission grappling.
It's so silly to think that you need to 

2154
01:32:47,221 --> 01:32:49,030
be just the guy.
Everybody is cross promoting each other.

2155
01:32:49,240 --> 01:32:51,950
I like when my guys fight Metamorris,
right?

2156
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,580
They're going to fight.
It helped me personally.

2157
01:32:54,770 --> 01:32:57,310
My guys,
Gio Boogie,

2158
01:32:57,460 --> 01:32:59,110
Nathan Orchard,
my guys,

2159
01:33:00,240 --> 01:33:05,240
I try to get them on metamorris carts,
texted hallock go,

2160
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:10,440
dude,
how could you not want ge or is on your 

2161
01:33:10,440 --> 01:33:12,961
fucking show?
He just blew through everybody in the 

2162
01:33:12,961 --> 01:33:13,060
Abu Dhabi trials all within two minutes 
to get everybody.

2163
01:33:13,180 --> 01:33:16,020
One Eva one as a featherweight one is a 
bad way.

2164
01:33:16,190 --> 01:33:21,190
Finished everybody.
How do you not want that guy to go 

2165
01:33:21,190 --> 01:33:25,090
there?
You're dealing with a rational 

2166
01:33:25,090 --> 01:33:25,090
individual.
That's the problem.

2167
01:33:25,090 --> 01:33:25,090
Well,
the people that are doing Jujitsu,

2168
01:33:25,090 --> 01:33:28,270
the people that are involved in Jujitsu,
if you're involved in these matches,

2169
01:33:28,271 --> 01:33:33,271
if you're involved in competition,
most likely 99 percent of the time 

2170
01:33:33,271 --> 01:33:34,180
you're making your money off of 
teaching.

2171
01:33:34,540 --> 01:33:39,540
Right?
Most of the people that are running 

2172
01:33:39,540 --> 01:33:39,540
these schools,
that's where they're making their money,

2173
01:33:39,540 --> 01:33:42,511
so it's not like a situation where 
there's this giant piece of pie that 

2174
01:33:42,511 --> 01:33:43,780
everybody's battling over,
so everybody wants dominance.

2175
01:33:43,930 --> 01:33:48,930
It's like it's beneficial for you to get
your students into metamorris because 

2176
01:33:48,930 --> 01:33:50,380
then they could highlight how good of a 
teacher you are.

2177
01:33:51,240 --> 01:33:53,730
Good for everybody.
That's good.

2178
01:33:53,890 --> 01:33:57,040
It's good for Metamorris.
It's good for Ebi when he comes back,

2179
01:33:57,041 --> 01:33:59,740
because will never be exclusive.
He's always going to be an Abi.

2180
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:00,340
Oh wait.
Yep.

2181
01:34:00,610 --> 01:34:04,600
And so why would I want to keep them 
from metamorris and back and forth?

2182
01:34:04,601 --> 01:34:05,540
I'd tell her,
I'd tell her,

2183
01:34:05,550 --> 01:34:07,510
look,
let's let's work together and use.

2184
01:34:07,810 --> 01:34:12,580
Let's let me blow up the guys and then 
ship them off to you.

2185
01:34:12,581 --> 01:34:14,860
I love Metamora,
but he makes the most money that way.

2186
01:34:15,590 --> 01:34:16,800
And then we come back,
we,

2187
01:34:17,020 --> 01:34:20,140
we bring them back over to Ebi.
I think this is the new way of thinking.

2188
01:34:20,141 --> 01:34:23,470
I think this,
this kind of exists in everything exists

2189
01:34:23,471 --> 01:34:28,471
in martial arts were martial arts today.
Like here's a perfect example of 

2190
01:34:28,471 --> 01:34:28,471
Jujitsu.

2191
01:34:28,471 --> 01:34:29,950
Guys are constantly trading techniques 
to each other,

2192
01:34:30,160 --> 01:34:35,160
constantly showing each other things.
The whole thing about martial arts in 

2193
01:34:35,160 --> 01:34:35,590
the old days,
like in the sixties,

2194
01:34:35,591 --> 01:34:37,330
in the seventies,
was how secret it was.

2195
01:34:37,590 --> 01:34:40,780
They had secret techniques and they 
would hide from you the seeing.

2196
01:34:40,781 --> 01:34:45,781
You couldn't teach white people member 
brutally got in trouble for teaching 

2197
01:34:45,781 --> 01:34:46,810
white people.
Same thing with Mexicans.

2198
01:34:46,811 --> 01:34:49,740
Either you couldn't teach western,
couldn't teach Americans you,

2199
01:34:49,810 --> 01:34:54,810
you know,
they wanted to keep it within the 

2200
01:34:54,810 --> 01:34:54,810
Chinese culture.
Now it's the total opposite.

2201
01:34:54,810 --> 01:34:58,920
Now everybody's exchanging and 
everybody's just trying to find out 

2202
01:34:58,920 --> 01:34:58,920
what's the best shit.
Who's the best at this?

2203
01:34:58,920 --> 01:35:00,260
And you get guys together and you match 
them up with each other.

2204
01:35:00,261 --> 01:35:05,261
I mean,
that's essentially the new thinking and 

2205
01:35:05,261 --> 01:35:08,210
new thinking for everything.
And the fact that this is how it is 

2206
01:35:08,210 --> 01:35:11,861
right now so far with Jujitsu,
with professional submission grappling 

2207
01:35:11,861 --> 01:35:13,040
is awesome.
That means it has a shot.

2208
01:35:13,250 --> 01:35:18,250
But as soon as someone comes along and 
buys the whole thing and then wants to 

2209
01:35:18,250 --> 01:35:18,250
put on only,
like you said,

2210
01:35:18,250 --> 01:35:21,380
12 matches a year,
like you compete,

2211
01:35:21,410 --> 01:35:23,930
how often do you compete in as once or 
twice.

2212
01:35:24,170 --> 01:35:25,070
Once to.
Twice a month.

2213
01:35:25,100 --> 01:35:26,840
Yeah.
That's insane.

2214
01:35:26,841 --> 01:35:28,520
And that's one of the reasons why you're
so good.

2215
01:35:28,790 --> 01:35:32,330
You're not just training all the time,
you're throwing yourself into battle all

2216
01:35:32,331 --> 01:35:33,470
the time.
You know,

2217
01:35:33,471 --> 01:35:36,950
I've seen quite a few of your,
your matches online and I saw the recent

2218
01:35:36,951 --> 01:35:37,570
one where you,
uh,

2219
01:35:37,610 --> 01:35:39,830
what's the guy's name?
The leg locks specialists.

2220
01:35:39,831 --> 01:35:42,470
The MMA guy I've seen held.
He's really good,

2221
01:35:42,471 --> 01:35:42,920
man.
Yeah.

2222
01:35:43,070 --> 01:35:45,020
That was a really,
really interesting fight.

2223
01:35:45,021 --> 01:35:50,021
It was really cool to watch.
He was probably one of the most game 

2224
01:35:50,021 --> 01:35:50,270
people that showed up to that show.
Like he was prepared.

2225
01:35:50,271 --> 01:35:52,130
I felt it.
I could see it,

2226
01:35:52,160 --> 01:35:53,060
you know,
like man,

2227
01:35:53,061 --> 01:35:54,110
that was a,
that was,

2228
01:35:54,750 --> 01:35:57,830
he was there.
He showed up for that Mesh for MMA.

2229
01:35:57,831 --> 01:35:59,690
His jujitsu technique is stellar.

2230
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:02,490
Yeah.
You talk about leg locks at work,

2231
01:36:02,491 --> 01:36:05,250
at mma and leg lockers that are having 
success.

2232
01:36:05,560 --> 01:36:10,560
Your number one guy a man back in the 
day when he used to go for leg locks a 

2233
01:36:10,891 --> 01:36:12,120
lot.
Now he really doesn't.

2234
01:36:12,690 --> 01:36:14,160
He's still awesome.
Uh,

2235
01:36:14,280 --> 01:36:15,320
and then you say,
oh,

2236
01:36:15,330 --> 01:36:20,330
that's right Marci Mel,
because he'll pull guard just like some 

2237
01:36:20,330 --> 01:36:22,630
art right into.
He'll hook up your,

2238
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:25,050
the performance that,
that,

2239
01:36:25,100 --> 01:36:26,550
uh,
really impressed me.

2240
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:31,560
There's a,
there are two performances and 

2241
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:33,831
metamorris man,
when you went against kit bail and you 

2242
01:36:33,831 --> 01:36:33,831
just,
you didn't even leg lock.

2243
01:36:33,831 --> 01:36:35,410
And he guillotine.
That setup was so beautiful.

2244
01:36:35,411 --> 01:36:36,410
That's a crazy setup.

2245
01:36:36,760 --> 01:36:39,080
Your arm was in a such a weird position 
when you were,

2246
01:36:39,110 --> 01:36:40,560
when you guys were trying to scramble.
Yeah,

2247
01:36:40,561 --> 01:36:40,640
yeah,

2248
01:36:40,730 --> 01:36:41,880
yeah.
And in Metamorris,

2249
01:36:41,881 --> 01:36:46,881
the whole metamorris is in a constant 
struggle with how do we put together 

2250
01:36:51,060 --> 01:36:53,520
exciting fights.
That's what it's all about it.

2251
01:36:53,521 --> 01:36:56,430
So there's a show comes out,
everyone on the internet goes boring,

2252
01:36:56,431 --> 01:36:57,120
boring.
Oh,

2253
01:36:57,121 --> 01:36:58,230
this one was great.
Are born.

2254
01:36:58,350 --> 01:37:01,110
It's always like.
So if you have a boring match,

2255
01:37:01,140 --> 01:37:03,150
people on the Internet are gonna fucking
flame.

2256
01:37:03,151 --> 01:37:05,000
You.
That's when everybody was mad at Brendan

2257
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:05,210
Shot.
Yeah,

2258
01:37:05,430 --> 01:37:06,270
exactly.
And,

2259
01:37:06,340 --> 01:37:06,850
and,
uh,

2260
01:37:07,230 --> 01:37:09,930
maybe the last I like them whether 
they're boring or not.

2261
01:37:09,931 --> 01:37:14,931
I liked the whole atmosphere.
I liked going to metamorris and hanging 

2262
01:37:14,931 --> 01:37:14,931
out.
I fucking love it.

2263
01:37:14,931 --> 01:37:16,710
It's a high level.
There's a lot of money behind it.

2264
01:37:16,910 --> 01:37:21,910
Um,
I wish I had that kind of money behind 

2265
01:37:21,910 --> 01:37:21,910
Abi then it would be on like donkey 
Kong,

2266
01:37:21,910 --> 01:37:23,790
but it's beautiful.
It's beautiful.

2267
01:37:23,791 --> 01:37:28,791
I love metal.
I love even when some matches are 

2268
01:37:28,791 --> 01:37:30,831
boring,
I love it because then I talked to the 

2269
01:37:30,831 --> 01:37:30,831
guy next to me,
you know what?

2270
01:37:30,831 --> 01:37:33,510
I'm just trying to watch a match.

2271
01:37:36,630 --> 01:37:38,700
Nachos.
They're outstanding.

2272
01:37:39,450 --> 01:37:41,120
You know,
the boring matches when the key matches.

2273
01:37:41,130 --> 01:37:42,180
Come on dude,
look around.

2274
01:37:42,660 --> 01:37:45,120
Everybody is on facebook and on 
Instagram,

2275
01:37:45,170 --> 01:37:50,170
on boring young.
Everybody is like communicating right 

2276
01:37:50,170 --> 01:37:50,170
during the match.
It's,

2277
01:37:50,170 --> 01:37:50,650
it's incredible.
But,

2278
01:37:51,090 --> 01:37:54,570
but,
but I'm in the middle of all that.

2279
01:37:54,930 --> 01:37:58,170
No one can say he just saving shell 
after Shell because his matches.

2280
01:37:58,230 --> 01:38:02,010
He goes out and just finishes.
I'm boring show except for Gary.

2281
01:38:02,740 --> 01:38:06,870
Gary tone and with two RS and a Kit 
Dale,

2282
01:38:06,920 --> 01:38:09,440
so you could find that.
And then that does.

2283
01:38:09,441 --> 01:38:12,600
He does maxwell match.
You know dude,

2284
01:38:12,601 --> 01:38:13,590
man,
you just,

2285
01:38:13,770 --> 01:38:18,770
you without you right now man.
Without you metamorris would be Ooh,

2286
01:38:19,590 --> 01:38:22,200
you're keeping a metamorris afloat 
because they're just boring.

2287
01:38:22,201 --> 01:38:23,940
Match after boring match.
Again.

2288
01:38:24,180 --> 01:38:26,400
I love Jujitsu.
I understand boring matches.

2289
01:38:26,580 --> 01:38:29,880
I think you've got to get.
I told her like don't.

2290
01:38:30,030 --> 01:38:33,360
He doesn't want to go pure and Augie 
because he feels like it's disrespectful

2291
01:38:33,361 --> 01:38:35,960
to assist the spirit of Jujitsu and 
shit.

2292
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:41,080
I told him,
I told him I go do what Abu Dhabi does 

2293
01:38:41,080 --> 01:38:41,590
util will make the decision.
Let the fighters make the decision.

2294
01:38:41,591 --> 01:38:43,920
And so you could wear anything you want.
And you know what?

2295
01:38:43,921 --> 01:38:45,750
When they have that decision,
knowing where shit.

2296
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:48,190
All the guys that love the GE,
they take it the fuck off.

2297
01:38:49,330 --> 01:38:51,190
That's how I.
But the hobby is I would be.

2298
01:38:51,210 --> 01:38:54,300
You could worry can you can at Quito 
pants.

2299
01:38:55,290 --> 01:38:57,420
You can wear anything.
You want the shit dude,

2300
01:38:57,421 --> 01:38:58,650
come on.
Come in with some.

2301
01:38:59,070 --> 01:39:00,570
At the top would be the one that you 
were at.

2302
01:39:00,571 --> 01:39:03,200
There was this Japanese fighter in a 
blue superman outfit.

2303
01:39:03,930 --> 01:39:05,460
Remember that guy?
People loved him,

2304
01:39:05,970 --> 01:39:08,760
but he showed up like several costumes.
It's like Spiderman.

2305
01:39:08,761 --> 01:39:11,880
Superman is if you do that,
if you do that,

2306
01:39:11,881 --> 01:39:13,110
the promoter,
he is off the hook.

2307
01:39:13,170 --> 01:39:14,550
Say,
I want it to be.

2308
01:39:14,610 --> 01:39:16,500
I want them to wear whatever they want.
You know what?

2309
01:39:16,501 --> 01:39:18,990
Nobody would work.
I think it comes down to what Joe said,

2310
01:39:19,130 --> 01:39:22,050
a huge events for the guy.
They have all these handles and weapons.

2311
01:39:22,110 --> 01:39:24,650
You'd be wearing the weapon around your 
neck and dude,

2312
01:39:25,020 --> 01:39:25,950
go straight.
Marco,

2313
01:39:25,951 --> 01:39:28,890
who was straight fucking those bikini 
briefs.

2314
01:39:28,891 --> 01:39:33,220
They were in Paris in pride,
in pride.

2315
01:39:33,230 --> 01:39:34,860
You could have all Jitsu guys go to 
pride.

2316
01:39:34,861 --> 01:39:39,861
The only one who's wearing a [inaudible]
Yoshida noise and he wasn't even 

2317
01:39:39,861 --> 01:39:40,200
Jujitsu,
but all the other Brazilians,

2318
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:42,810
they're wearing those bikini's that they
were on the beach.

2319
01:39:43,020 --> 01:39:44,900
They're shaving their legs.
The greasy,

2320
01:39:44,970 --> 01:39:46,950
the greener.
Mccoys took the g off.

2321
01:39:47,180 --> 01:39:52,180
Remember?
Boy started wearing the g pants when he 

2322
01:39:52,180 --> 01:39:52,520
fought Aki Bono.
G Pants top.

2323
01:39:52,570 --> 01:39:54,450
Yup.
And here it is in Metamorris.

2324
01:39:55,970 --> 01:39:58,200
Hallock.
Please don't sue us for this.

2325
01:39:58,201 --> 01:40:01,620
We're trying to pop up metamorris no 
need to get crazy and this.

2326
01:40:01,620 --> 01:40:03,630
This is the match that made kid dale 
lift weights.

2327
01:40:04,050 --> 01:40:05,620
I follow instagram.
Oh Dude,

2328
01:40:05,740 --> 01:40:09,160
he was.
He was jacked during that.

2329
01:40:09,570 --> 01:40:13,260
Everybody kept telling me how much I 
rather than it going to be wrong.

2330
01:40:13,261 --> 01:40:14,670
No were wrong.
He was very big,

2331
01:40:14,671 --> 01:40:17,430
but now he's giant and you've seen the 
pictures of him on his instagram.

2332
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:19,680
Holy Shit.
That guy's swole.

2333
01:40:19,681 --> 01:40:22,980
The fuck up now.
You made them lift weights.

2334
01:40:23,550 --> 01:40:26,530
If you look at his instagram,
you look at it is why are you looking?

2335
01:40:26,580 --> 01:40:28,380
You're looking at funding.
Someone said something stupid.

2336
01:40:28,460 --> 01:40:33,460
What's APP when they're introducing you?
Because they can call me a five time 

2337
01:40:33,460 --> 01:40:34,740
Nogi world champion,
which is not true.

2338
01:40:35,240 --> 01:40:40,240
So views that.
Chris,

2339
01:40:42,200 --> 01:40:45,150
whose idea was that together?
I don't know man.

2340
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:47,490
Chris Howard is old school,
black belt man,

2341
01:40:47,640 --> 01:40:49,090
old school Machado.
Linear.

2342
01:40:49,120 --> 01:40:51,240
She's been around a long time.
That's cool to see that.

2343
01:40:51,241 --> 01:40:52,830
He's refereeing this.

2344
01:40:54,140 --> 01:40:54,540
Yeah.
Our.

2345
01:40:54,590 --> 01:40:56,380
Our video sucks.
If Fat Dick Today.

2346
01:40:56,530 --> 01:40:57,640
Dude,
I love that role.

2347
01:40:57,641 --> 01:41:01,190
And unguided do the cut to a photo.
Little skyline.

2348
01:41:01,770 --> 01:41:02,920
Fuck.
Is that WHO's running?

2349
01:41:03,630 --> 01:41:08,590
Who's running the operating board?
So you pull half guard here immediately.

2350
01:41:09,130 --> 01:41:12,560
Tisdale's on top of you.
And what do you,

2351
01:41:12,580 --> 01:41:17,580
uh,
you try and establish here when you're 

2352
01:41:17,580 --> 01:41:17,580
doing this,
what's your go to shit.

2353
01:41:17,580 --> 01:41:19,330
It's Camorra's from here or I'm probably
trying to come underneath them for a leg

2354
01:41:19,331 --> 01:41:20,310
lock.
Um,

2355
01:41:20,820 --> 01:41:22,600
so.
So you play in it light here.

2356
01:41:22,960 --> 01:41:25,810
We'll relaxed.
No one's gone crazy yet.

2357
01:41:26,200 --> 01:41:27,610
You guys got a long match,
right?

2358
01:41:27,611 --> 01:41:31,090
It's like a 20 minute match.
So when you have a match like this,

2359
01:41:31,530 --> 01:41:36,530
are you a,
are you really consciously like 

2360
01:41:36,530 --> 01:41:38,200
budgeting your time and your energy a 
little bit?

2361
01:41:38,230 --> 01:41:40,420
I use you,
you use your energy efficiently.

2362
01:41:40,421 --> 01:41:42,310
When I,
I'll feel I'll use my energy when I feel

2363
01:41:42,311 --> 01:41:44,020
like it's a,
it's going to help me attack,

2364
01:41:44,021 --> 01:41:45,850
you know what I mean?
I'm not going to use energy just to push

2365
01:41:45,851 --> 01:41:46,870
and pull,
you know,

2366
01:41:46,871 --> 01:41:48,820
if I'm going to,
I'm going to use it to make sure I'm not

2367
01:41:48,821 --> 01:41:51,520
in danger to make sure my opponents.
So now you're going after his leg.

2368
01:41:51,590 --> 01:41:54,040
Damn beautiful.
Jamie.

2369
01:41:54,370 --> 01:41:57,850
And then you'd have to look at this 
point wasn't very good.

2370
01:41:57,970 --> 01:41:58,670
Um,
you know,

2371
01:41:58,720 --> 01:42:02,150
my form there is a little off to nasty 
transition.

2372
01:42:02,151 --> 01:42:07,151
There's definitely some things that I 
could've done a hell of a man that 

2373
01:42:07,151 --> 01:42:08,260
looks,
that looks terrifying.

2374
01:42:08,261 --> 01:42:09,710
And he's rolling here?
Yes.

2375
01:42:09,800 --> 01:42:10,270
Okay.

2376
01:42:12,450 --> 01:42:13,810
Dale gets out.
How dare he,

2377
01:42:14,770 --> 01:42:17,500
you could tell it looked like you were 
at everything.

2378
01:42:17,750 --> 01:42:19,510
Go right back to this as your go to 
shit.

2379
01:42:19,511 --> 01:42:20,380
Huh?
Outside he'll hook.

2380
01:42:20,390 --> 01:42:22,030
You need to be perfect for them to work,
man.

2381
01:42:22,060 --> 01:42:24,680
It's just so much detail.
But uh,

2382
01:42:24,930 --> 01:42:28,570
yeah man and back in half.
And then some camera work.

2383
01:42:28,571 --> 01:42:33,571
Metamorris save on lights.
They go back to kids with every good 

2384
01:42:35,340 --> 01:42:36,940
passer.
Very good.

2385
01:42:37,150 --> 01:42:39,340
He actually showed up to my job right 
before this.

2386
01:42:39,390 --> 01:42:44,390
Yeah,
I heard he was training with you guys 

2387
01:42:44,390 --> 01:42:44,600
and coincidentally did we were working 
on your site.

2388
01:42:44,640 --> 01:42:47,570
So then coincidentally it wasn't trying 
to,

2389
01:42:48,130 --> 01:42:49,620
that's what he was saying.
He was saying,

2390
01:42:49,650 --> 01:42:50,710
Oh yeah,
they're trying to get.

2391
01:42:50,720 --> 01:42:55,720
That's all we were doing for a while and
he showed up and he's fighting gary 

2392
01:42:55,720 --> 01:42:55,720
toning and I'm like,
I'm not going to change my,

2393
01:42:55,720 --> 01:42:57,940
my,
I gotta show this to my students.

2394
01:42:58,240 --> 01:43:00,060
So I apologize for that.
No,

2395
01:43:00,061 --> 01:43:00,820
it's all good,
man.

2396
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:03,160
It was not on purpose.
It was not on purpose.

2397
01:43:03,220 --> 01:43:05,200
I've never met him.
He just showed up to my gym.

2398
01:43:05,320 --> 01:43:06,730
Really Nice Guy.
Cool Dude.

2399
01:43:06,940 --> 01:43:08,950
I ended up falling on instagram and all 
that stuff,

2400
01:43:08,951 --> 01:43:10,810
but yeah,
he's a funny dude.

2401
01:43:11,240 --> 01:43:16,240
I'm sure.
Kindergarten stuff compared to what you 

2402
01:43:16,240 --> 01:43:18,860
guys know what I'm agenda so that the 
computer fucking up.

2403
01:43:19,410 --> 01:43:24,410
Yeah.
So we get back out to the feet and then 

2404
01:43:24,410 --> 01:43:27,301
me,
I drilled this with my wrestling coach 

2405
01:43:27,301 --> 01:43:27,301
for,
you know,

2406
01:43:27,301 --> 01:43:27,301
we do this all the time.
He's still drilling.

2407
01:43:27,301 --> 01:43:30,820
I'm just establishing the under hook 
from collar ties and hitting a good snap

2408
01:43:30,821 --> 01:43:34,990
down from here to get a good snap down 
and get control of the head now and then

2409
01:43:34,991 --> 01:43:37,570
I just follow it and now my hands aren't
connected yet.

2410
01:43:38,140 --> 01:43:43,140
Right.
And then I'm trying to connect my hands 

2411
01:43:43,140 --> 01:43:45,350
finally get it.
And once the hands get connected he 

2412
01:43:45,350 --> 01:43:47,500
tries to struggle out a couple more 
times and finally sinks in deep.

2413
01:43:48,010 --> 01:43:50,890
I can't believe we can't see this j 
we've got to deal with that today.

2414
01:43:50,900 --> 01:43:51,200
Okay.

2415
01:43:52,940 --> 01:43:57,940
This is annoying.
Is the one time where it'd be really 

2416
01:43:57,940 --> 01:43:58,220
nice to have video.
I can get Zach to help you,

2417
01:43:58,450 --> 01:44:01,990
Jamie,
and yeah,

2418
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,070
we can do whatever you got to take care 
of that.

2419
01:44:04,071 --> 01:44:04,980
Can you play it at all?
Or.

2420
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:08,810
We done stuff on mad right at the sweet 
spot.

2421
01:44:09,410 --> 01:44:09,770
Yeah.

2422
01:44:11,850 --> 01:44:12,050
No,

2423
01:44:14,490 --> 01:44:16,410
what's happening Jamie?
There it is.

2424
01:44:16,470 --> 01:44:19,320
There it goes and he already tapped.
Perfect.

2425
01:44:19,321 --> 01:44:20,470
Okay.
Back it up a little bit then.

2426
01:44:22,640 --> 01:44:24,960
So this is the part where you don't have
your hands connected.

2427
01:44:25,390 --> 01:44:26,550
Yeah,
because it does have your arm.

2428
01:44:26,551 --> 01:44:30,240
He ducked hard so that my hands were 
separated and then I connect him.

2429
01:44:30,241 --> 01:44:33,390
Finally get that crunching on the neck.
Then you got it from half guard here.

2430
01:44:33,391 --> 01:44:35,280
Huh?
Are Men or Marcella team?

2431
01:44:35,570 --> 01:44:36,510
Uh,
it's uh,

2432
01:44:36,520 --> 01:44:41,520
you know,
it's high elbow Gulati and you catch 

2433
01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:41,520
this from half guard all the time.
Um,

2434
01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:41,820
yeah.
Yeah.

2435
01:44:41,821 --> 01:44:46,821
Well I don't set it up from half guard 
but I ended up in half guard for the 

2436
01:44:46,821 --> 01:44:47,190
finish for sure.
And then we come up a little bit.

2437
01:44:47,660 --> 01:44:49,110
We reset it.
Boom.

2438
01:44:49,290 --> 01:44:52,540
Wow.
You got a full mouth Marcella,

2439
01:44:52,620 --> 01:44:54,300
or you guys call it high elbow.
High Elbow.

2440
01:44:54,301 --> 01:44:54,730
But yeah,
yeah,

2441
01:44:54,731 --> 01:44:54,870
yeah.

2442
01:44:54,870 --> 01:44:55,920
I mean,
Marcella uses it.

2443
01:44:55,921 --> 01:44:57,130
Yeah.
No,

2444
01:44:57,230 --> 01:44:59,100
finished in full garb with his arm 
trapped.

2445
01:44:59,130 --> 01:45:01,200
His arm was trapped.
His was his left arm trapped.

2446
01:45:01,400 --> 01:45:02,640
Uh,
I didn't see.

2447
01:45:02,730 --> 01:45:04,140
I didn't see that.
I'd have to watch it again.

2448
01:45:04,170 --> 01:45:05,760
I don't know if I intentionally trapped 
it,

2449
01:45:05,761 --> 01:45:08,460
but damn,
that guillotine right there,

2450
01:45:08,461 --> 01:45:12,660
man.
That was huge one seeing Marcello hit it

2451
01:45:12,661 --> 01:45:17,661
all the time.
The only reason I called it Marcella 

2452
01:45:17,661 --> 01:45:19,671
teen,
I didn't know it was called high high 

2453
01:45:19,671 --> 01:45:19,671
elbow Gilot time.
Sure.

2454
01:45:19,671 --> 01:45:22,131
That was a name.
But I just stuck with Marcella teen so 

2455
01:45:22,131 --> 01:45:23,340
that in,
in the 10th planet system,

2456
01:45:23,400 --> 01:45:25,860
every time that comes up and it's so 
crucial,

2457
01:45:25,980 --> 01:45:30,980
it's a part of our warm ups that I want 
Marcello to make sure he gets credit 

2458
01:45:30,980 --> 01:45:34,971
because sure,
no one's had more success with it than 

2459
01:45:34,971 --> 01:45:34,971
anybody I would say because of that 
success.

2460
01:45:34,971 --> 01:45:35,990
He's probably the best at it.

2461
01:45:36,030 --> 01:45:38,880
No,
I've seen him run through black belts.

2462
01:45:39,270 --> 01:45:44,270
Uh,
I've seen her run through a high level 

2463
01:45:44,270 --> 01:45:44,270
black belt 10 times in 10 minutes.
What's the same?

2464
01:45:44,270 --> 01:45:45,120
The same guillotine technique,
man.

2465
01:45:45,180 --> 01:45:50,180
John was preaching to me to get good at 
that technique for so long and like I 

2466
01:45:50,180 --> 01:45:52,320
sucked at it for forever.
It takes a long time.

2467
01:45:52,440 --> 01:45:54,200
How will you connecting your hands?
Uh,

2468
01:45:54,201 --> 01:45:57,270
I just grab.
So when I grabbed like mid,

2469
01:45:57,400 --> 01:46:02,400
mid.
Should I go down past the pinky 

2470
01:46:02,400 --> 01:46:04,630
inbetween the risks and the,
and the pinky bone and then grabbed my 

2471
01:46:04,630 --> 01:46:04,630
left hand over the right hand,
grab my hand.

2472
01:46:04,630 --> 01:46:05,880
I know I've hit some on the left side 
and competition.

2473
01:46:05,910 --> 01:46:07,290
I've gone the opposite direction.
But um,

2474
01:46:07,320 --> 01:46:09,510
in terms of like if I'm finishing on the
right side.

2475
01:46:09,511 --> 01:46:10,230
Yeah.
Left hand over.

2476
01:46:10,231 --> 01:46:11,940
Right.
So I've seen people hit it,

2477
01:46:11,970 --> 01:46:16,970
hit it like this.
I've seen people do it with 10 finger 

2478
01:46:16,970 --> 01:46:16,970
grips.

2479
01:46:16,970 --> 01:46:16,970
Yup.
Yup.

2480
01:46:16,970 --> 01:46:21,050
The difference between those,
what Marcella told me is this feels so 

2481
01:46:21,181 --> 01:46:24,450
much easier for me,
but what Marcella says,

2482
01:46:24,540 --> 01:46:26,040
and uh,
Danny does it this way too,

2483
01:46:26,340 --> 01:46:28,470
but marcel,
we went over it.

2484
01:46:28,471 --> 01:46:33,471
He said he doesn't like this as opposed 
to this because the guard underneath is 

2485
01:46:33,601 --> 01:46:38,601
going to come up and reach and grab.
And if he gets in between these two 

2486
01:46:38,601 --> 01:46:39,930
hands here,
his fingers are going to come up,

2487
01:46:39,990 --> 01:46:41,970
he can wreck the grip.
You got to be the grip.

2488
01:46:42,120 --> 01:46:44,250
But if he comes up here and I come this 
way,

2489
01:46:44,400 --> 01:46:46,830
it doesn't matter if he grabs the 
inside.

2490
01:46:47,100 --> 01:46:49,390
That's how most people think they're 
doing right thing.

2491
01:46:49,391 --> 01:46:49,700
They're gone

2492
01:46:50,130 --> 01:46:55,130
and I still get choked.
They're gonna still get choked because 

2493
01:46:55,130 --> 01:46:57,000
he's coming around it instead of here.
So that makes sense.

2494
01:46:57,240 --> 01:46:59,670
It makes a lot of sense.
There's a bunch of different.

2495
01:46:59,770 --> 01:47:02,250
We're talking about people don't know if
you're listening to,

2496
01:47:02,251 --> 01:47:07,251
especially.
There's a bunch of different ways to 

2497
01:47:07,251 --> 01:47:07,251
hold your hands with different 
submissions.

2498
01:47:07,251 --> 01:47:11,541
And that's one of the interesting things
about Jujitsu is that there's little 

2499
01:47:11,541 --> 01:47:12,060
tweaks that you'll learn a little turns 
and twists.

2500
01:47:12,300 --> 01:47:14,880
Like Einstein always likes to call it 
freedom rock.

2501
01:47:14,970 --> 01:47:17,720
You know that one team where like,
you know,

2502
01:47:17,850 --> 01:47:19,710
you ever seen that commercial for 
freedom rock.

2503
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:24,920
It's like ridiculous.
A commercial for one of those 

2504
01:47:24,920 --> 01:47:26,790
compilation records that you would buy 
when you turn it up,

2505
01:47:26,791 --> 01:47:28,710
man.
So like the turning it up,

2506
01:47:28,950 --> 01:47:31,410
freedom rock,
like the turning your,

2507
01:47:31,411 --> 01:47:36,411
your,
your hand to the side and forcing the 

2508
01:47:36,411 --> 01:47:36,411
blade of your wrist.

2509
01:47:36,411 --> 01:47:40,070
And this one's named,
he named me basically named the squeeze 

2510
01:47:40,070 --> 01:47:43,671
of the dark.
There wasn't a name for what you're 

2511
01:47:43,671 --> 01:47:43,671
technically doing,
you know?

2512
01:47:43,671 --> 01:47:45,090
Uh,
so he named it and it's a good name.

2513
01:47:45,300 --> 01:47:46,590
It's a great name.
It's freedom rock.

2514
01:47:46,620 --> 01:47:50,040
Just to remind you that it's just,
it's not just figure four on your arms,

2515
01:47:50,430 --> 01:47:53,940
you got to turn it in and squeeze.
So it's a smart thing.

2516
01:47:54,150 --> 01:47:59,150
It is a smart thing and it's cool that 
there's those little technical things 

2517
01:47:59,150 --> 01:48:02,541
about Jujitsu and for,
for people that get involved in it and 

2518
01:48:02,541 --> 01:48:06,591
start realizing like from the outside,
you look at one way and then you get 

2519
01:48:06,591 --> 01:48:06,591
involved in it and you start seeing all 
the depth to it.

2520
01:48:06,630 --> 01:48:10,120
That's where all the Jujitsu nerds come 
into place because that's what it does.

2521
01:48:10,150 --> 01:48:15,150
It seem.
It doesn't seem to jive like people 

2522
01:48:15,150 --> 01:48:17,050
like,
well how come these really computer 

2523
01:48:17,050 --> 01:48:19,071
oriented,
nerdy kind of dudes are so in love with 

2524
01:48:19,071 --> 01:48:19,071
Jujitsu?

2525
01:48:19,071 --> 01:48:19,071
Well,
you know,

2526
01:48:19,071 --> 01:48:23,370
like Donna,
her always talks about there's a video 

2527
01:48:23,370 --> 01:48:24,360
that we were talking about earlier that 
they playing on the underground with him

2528
01:48:24,361 --> 01:48:26,220
talking about it being high level 
problem,

2529
01:48:26,340 --> 01:48:31,340
problem solving under stress,
and that's what's exciting about people 

2530
01:48:31,340 --> 01:48:35,061
who are,
maybe they would be into video games or 

2531
01:48:35,061 --> 01:48:38,661
maybe they'd be into chats or maybe 
they'd be into all sorts of problem 

2532
01:48:38,661 --> 01:48:39,870
solving type things,
but you get doing it in real time.

2533
01:48:39,871 --> 01:48:44,130
The rush of success is so much better.
Like the rush of winning a chess match,

2534
01:48:44,131 --> 01:48:49,131
I'm sure is great,
but do you think it is good as you 

2535
01:48:49,131 --> 01:48:49,920
choking kit dale out of here,
get the fuck out of here.

2536
01:48:49,921 --> 01:48:51,810
There's no way.
It's not even possible.

2537
01:48:52,140 --> 01:48:54,300
You know,
that rush is the ultimate rush.

2538
01:48:54,301 --> 01:48:55,560
That's the,
you're dead rush.

2539
01:48:55,740 --> 01:49:00,740
This is not a like a Bang Bang.
You're dead in a virtual sense when 

2540
01:49:00,740 --> 01:49:00,840
you're wake character.

2541
01:49:01,070 --> 01:49:05,040
This is like you're playing death.
Somebody overlaid some of your podcasts,

2542
01:49:05,090 --> 01:49:06,870
uh,
over some like Jujitsu video,

2543
01:49:07,020 --> 01:49:12,020
uh,
some real about you talking about 

2544
01:49:12,020 --> 01:49:12,020
submissions and like what submissions 
really are,

2545
01:49:12,020 --> 01:49:12,600
what a tap really is.
And you're like,

2546
01:49:12,660 --> 01:49:17,660
oh yeah,
that's I just possibly killed you right 

2547
01:49:17,660 --> 01:49:17,660
there.
Yeah.

2548
01:49:17,660 --> 01:49:17,660
You're killing dudes.
You killed.

2549
01:49:17,660 --> 01:49:20,350
Killed Kennedy mean perfect.
Perfect.

2550
01:49:20,360 --> 01:49:25,360
It's also beautiful for people that are 
practicing it that you could kill a guy 

2551
01:49:25,360 --> 01:49:25,650
like that and look,
he's fine afterwards.

2552
01:49:26,170 --> 01:49:28,110
You're holding his hand up.
He's fine.

2553
01:49:28,111 --> 01:49:31,740
Means neck was sore the next day,
but other than that he's fine.

2554
01:49:31,950 --> 01:49:34,230
He didn't get knocked out.
He didn't get beat up.

2555
01:49:34,380 --> 01:49:38,190
So it's almost like a more ethical form 
of combat entertainment.

2556
01:49:38,191 --> 01:49:41,700
If somebody was going to put it on,
somebody decided to put the Ebi on spike

2557
01:49:41,701 --> 01:49:43,620
tv or something like that.
It's like,

2558
01:49:43,700 --> 01:49:45,030
you know,
everybody has a problem with,

2559
01:49:45,090 --> 01:49:46,050
with head trauma.

2560
01:49:46,200 --> 01:49:51,200
Like that fucking kid that just died.
A boxer just died the other day of 

2561
01:49:51,200 --> 01:49:54,770
trauma.
It's going to happen no matter what if 

2562
01:49:54,770 --> 01:49:55,390
you have combat sports.
But in Jujitsu it's way,

2563
01:49:55,391 --> 01:49:56,380
way,
way,

2564
01:49:56,381 --> 01:49:57,520
way,
way,

2565
01:49:57,521 --> 01:49:58,990
way,
way safer.

2566
01:49:59,010 --> 01:50:04,010
Yeah,
absolutely safe for longterm for the 

2567
01:50:04,010 --> 01:50:05,881
participants.
And you could still like you watched 

2568
01:50:05,881 --> 01:50:05,881
that match,
man,

2569
01:50:05,881 --> 01:50:06,220
that's exciting.
Shit.

2570
01:50:06,221 --> 01:50:09,490
I dare anybody who knows nothing about 
Jujitsu,

2571
01:50:09,700 --> 01:50:14,700
just watch Gary Thompson versus Kit Dale
and watch it with an open mind and watch

2572
01:50:14,891 --> 01:50:16,930
those transitions that you're going 
through and you realize like,

2573
01:50:16,931 --> 01:50:17,680
Whoa,
this is a.

2574
01:50:17,900 --> 01:50:19,630
they're doing a crazy thing here.
They're like,

2575
01:50:19,870 --> 01:50:24,870
they're like Helson Gracie.
I had Steve Maxwell and the podcast the 

2576
01:50:24,870 --> 01:50:29,671
other day and Helson Gracie.
Somebody asked him to describe Jujitsu 

2577
01:50:29,671 --> 01:50:33,151
and I guess his English is not the best 
in the world and he's got a little bit 

2578
01:50:33,151 --> 01:50:33,151
of an accent.
He goes,

2579
01:50:33,151 --> 01:50:33,250
this is Jujutsu.

2580
01:50:33,670 --> 01:50:35,650
You do this.
Then I do that.

2581
01:50:35,860 --> 01:50:38,770
Then you do this.
Then I do that forever.

2582
01:50:40,090 --> 01:50:45,090
Isn't that the dopest fucking answer me?
That is kind of what it is in a way 

2583
01:50:45,090 --> 01:50:49,861
until one of us almost dies or keep it 
until you can't keep it up anymore,

2584
01:50:51,971 --> 01:50:56,971
and then that guy beats you.
The super hyper way of killing someone 

2585
01:50:56,971 --> 01:50:57,250
and breaking their limbs.
John dammit her.

2586
01:50:57,370 --> 01:50:59,860
Remember we hung out with them that one 
night he said,

2587
01:51:00,100 --> 01:51:01,420
if you,
if you look at it,

2588
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:06,920
a striking is the least intelligent way 
of taking someone out,

2589
01:51:07,600 --> 01:51:09,370
grappling that's the most intelligent 
way.

2590
01:51:09,400 --> 01:51:11,980
Striking is the most caveman way of 
fighting,

2591
01:51:11,981 --> 01:51:16,981
just keep hitting each other's heads 
over and over until someone goes down 

2592
01:51:17,380 --> 01:51:22,380
when grappling is like,
let me take this guy down and 

2593
01:51:22,380 --> 01:51:24,871
scientifically put them,
put them to sleep and get the hell out 

2594
01:51:24,871 --> 01:51:27,521
of that is true,
but in a situation where you can't 

2595
01:51:27,521 --> 01:51:29,740
grapple with someone,
like if you're in a street fight,

2596
01:51:29,860 --> 01:51:34,860
would you want to be in a street fight 
with Marcella Garcia in a bar or would 

2597
01:51:34,860 --> 01:51:34,860
you want to be in the street fight with 
John Wayne.

2598
01:51:35,560 --> 01:51:40,560
John Wayne Park is going to be head kick
and motherfuckers and putting people in 

2599
01:51:40,560 --> 01:51:43,801
the hospital with elbows to the face 
like you tried to get close to that 

2600
01:51:43,801 --> 01:51:46,951
dude.
You're going to get your head smashed 

2601
01:51:46,951 --> 01:51:46,951
in.
John always talks about striking eyes,

2602
01:51:46,951 --> 01:51:50,841
like inability to do crazy amounts of 
damage in such a short period of time.

2603
01:51:51,221 --> 01:51:54,730
So there's clearly pluses and minuses to
both in real life situations.

2604
01:51:55,090 --> 01:52:00,090
Absolutely.
You don't want to just go to the ground 

2605
01:52:00,090 --> 01:52:00,090
striking skills.
I wish I was a kickboxer.

2606
01:52:00,100 --> 01:52:03,220
It would be nice to be able to have the 
confidence to throw,

2607
01:52:03,350 --> 01:52:05,670
you know,
you could take three dudes out if you're

2608
01:52:05,720 --> 01:52:08,920
striking move.
If you time it perfectly,

2609
01:52:08,921 --> 01:52:12,100
you can take three dudes out for those 
who don't know and they fuck with Melvin

2610
01:52:12,101 --> 01:52:15,560
manhoef in a bar.
First guys asleep dead.

2611
01:52:15,730 --> 01:52:18,310
There's two guys left.
One guy runs says fuck that,

2612
01:52:18,520 --> 01:52:20,020
and then it's one on one and that guy's 
dead.

2613
01:52:20,021 --> 01:52:21,010
He's dead.
He's dead.

2614
01:52:21,190 --> 01:52:22,250
Badr,
Hari Badr,

2615
01:52:22,270 --> 01:52:23,590
Hari.
Apparently they,

2616
01:52:23,710 --> 01:52:26,230
one of the reasons why he was from jail 
more than once,

2617
01:52:26,231 --> 01:52:29,620
I think beating the fuck out of people.
One of the reasons why he's in jail.

2618
01:52:29,650 --> 01:52:34,650
They took this guy's leg and they 
stomped it and snapped his Shin in half 

2619
01:52:34,650 --> 01:52:38,890
and this guy is fucked the wrong dude to
fuck with,

2620
01:52:38,920 --> 01:52:39,610
you know,
in a,

2621
01:52:39,660 --> 01:52:42,880
in a street confrontation.
So I see both sides.

2622
01:52:43,510 --> 01:52:44,080
You know,
it's,

2623
01:52:44,081 --> 01:52:46,190
it's good to.
You can get like super

2624
01:52:46,190 --> 01:52:48,680
high level and striking.
It is intelligent.

2625
01:52:48,740 --> 01:52:51,020
It's more intelligent than wrestling 
with somebody.

2626
01:52:51,021 --> 01:52:56,021
You know,
if you're in a bar and a bunch of other 

2627
01:52:56,021 --> 01:52:56,021
people around and you're in a melee type
situation,

2628
01:52:56,021 --> 01:52:57,730
if you can be a John Donner,
her,

2629
01:52:57,850 --> 01:52:58,430
you know,
look,

2630
01:52:58,460 --> 01:53:00,350
you could,
you could protect yourself for sure.

2631
01:53:00,370 --> 01:53:02,580
You know,
John is an excellent blackbelt.

2632
01:53:02,630 --> 01:53:05,810
Anybody that goes one on one with them 
is just going to get mangled.

2633
01:53:05,811 --> 01:53:08,210
Some untrained person doesn't know any 
better,

2634
01:53:09,080 --> 01:53:14,080
but I'll,
I'll be willing to bet that even 

2635
01:53:14,080 --> 01:53:16,301
multiple people that have tried to 
attack John had some trouble as a 

2636
01:53:16,301 --> 01:53:16,310
bouncer.
Absolutely many years of his life.

2637
01:53:16,311 --> 01:53:19,130
He's had to deal with a lot of that.
So he would use you as a shield.

2638
01:53:19,330 --> 01:53:24,330
Oh,
start using your arms to beat other 

2639
01:53:24,330 --> 01:53:25,430
people senseless with.
But the point being is not unintelligent

2640
01:53:25,431 --> 01:53:27,610
to have a John Wayne par skillset and 
there's,

2641
01:53:27,740 --> 01:53:32,740
there's definitely an intelligent way to
use striking obviously Badr Hari or hey,

2642
01:53:33,020 --> 01:53:36,920
I didn't say that.
I was just throwing her under the bus.

2643
01:53:39,060 --> 01:53:44,060
Why do you feel like we're doing all the
time and just completely misconstruing 

2644
01:53:44,060 --> 01:53:46,670
everything he's ever said to us.
Just ruining all of it.

2645
01:53:46,700 --> 01:53:48,210
There's no either or.
Because.

2646
01:53:48,340 --> 01:53:53,340
Because there's a lot of intelligence 
and there's a lot of technique to high 

2647
01:53:53,340 --> 01:53:56,561
level striking if you watch like those 
Lawrence Kenshin breakdowns or the Jack 

2648
01:53:56,561 --> 01:53:57,620
Slack breakdowns on the under 
underground.

2649
01:53:57,860 --> 01:54:02,000
He goes over like the real technical 
process of why like bluecat or you know,

2650
01:54:02,001 --> 01:54:04,820
a yachtsman Cli on the really high level
Thai guys.

2651
01:54:04,821 --> 01:54:07,450
Why they're so good.
There's a lot of shit going on.

2652
01:54:08,140 --> 01:54:10,220
It just looks like they're smashing each
other with their bones.

2653
01:54:10,221 --> 01:54:15,221
But nope.
How one guy keeps getting smashed and 

2654
01:54:15,221 --> 01:54:15,490
the other guy does all the smashing like
this.

2655
01:54:15,590 --> 01:54:17,970
And I know,
I know guys that are dummies,

2656
01:54:17,980 --> 01:54:21,290
shit and amazing Jujitsu.
So,

2657
01:54:21,600 --> 01:54:26,600
you know,
I know some really super strong and the 

2658
01:54:29,420 --> 01:54:32,210
same either currently.

2659
01:54:32,230 --> 01:54:33,210
Um,
I'm,

2660
01:54:33,270 --> 01:54:38,270
I'm excited about Jujitsu right now.
I think there's like one of the best 

2661
01:54:38,270 --> 01:54:38,270
times for whatever because of all the,
the,

2662
01:54:38,270 --> 01:54:42,820
the,
like people talking about it on the 

2663
01:54:42,820 --> 01:54:42,820
Internet and all these online 
communities that have formed,

2664
01:54:42,820 --> 01:54:45,860
it seems to me electric Jitsu has a lot 
of enthusiasm behind it right now.

2665
01:54:46,950 --> 01:54:51,950
The gracie nationals and gracie world,
they proved rose gracie prove that you 

2666
01:54:51,981 --> 01:54:56,360
can do submission only because before 
that it was submission only.

2667
01:54:56,361 --> 01:54:59,030
What a submission only matched with like
a a dream,

2668
01:54:59,031 --> 01:55:00,980
like a fantasy.
What if,

2669
01:55:00,981 --> 01:55:05,981
what if gracie nationals,
gracie world's made it work and then 

2670
01:55:05,981 --> 01:55:09,650
metamorris did the whole prestigious 
single match,

2671
01:55:09,740 --> 01:55:11,390
you know,
UFC type event.

2672
01:55:11,750 --> 01:55:13,490
And what do you think Abu Dhabi should 
do?

2673
01:55:13,520 --> 01:55:14,880
Because that's where all the money,
right?

2674
01:55:14,900 --> 01:55:17,060
That guy has more money than anybody on 
the planet should do.

2675
01:55:17,061 --> 01:55:22,061
Submission only Ebi rules.
Not because I made it up as I personally

2676
01:55:22,761 --> 01:55:26,210
think I'm constantly changed like the 
overtime I'm tweaking it.

2677
01:55:26,211 --> 01:55:28,220
I'm trying to make it so that someone 
says,

2678
01:55:28,221 --> 01:55:30,320
well what about if a dude does this?
And overtime like,

2679
01:55:30,350 --> 01:55:31,460
Oh shit,
we got to change.

2680
01:55:31,470 --> 01:55:36,470
I was having.
I had a long conversation with John 

2681
01:55:36,470 --> 01:55:36,470
Banner about a month ago about the 
overtime.

2682
01:55:36,470 --> 01:55:37,530
What do we do right here?
I'm old.

2683
01:55:37,560 --> 01:55:40,330
I'm not going to be one of those guys.
It's going to see a glaring problem.

2684
01:55:40,500 --> 01:55:43,070
I'm going to do what the Japanese do.
Someone presents a problem.

2685
01:55:43,080 --> 01:55:44,040
They go,
Oh shit,

2686
01:55:44,060 --> 01:55:45,600
let's make it better.
I'm going to switch it.

2687
01:55:45,601 --> 01:55:46,410
So,
um,

2688
01:55:48,660 --> 01:55:53,660
anyways,
the shake of Abu Dhabi has the most 

2689
01:55:53,660 --> 01:55:54,780
influence,
the most enthusiasm.

2690
01:55:54,781 --> 01:55:57,510
He is a black belt.
That's the guy.

2691
01:55:57,590 --> 01:55:59,250
Yeah.
If anybody's to take shape,

2692
01:55:59,260 --> 01:56:04,260
top nunes,
the guy who's going to take this and 

2693
01:56:04,260 --> 01:56:05,901
make it mainstream,
I think he should do each tournament on 

2694
01:56:05,901 --> 01:56:09,171
a separate day.
Make it like a week thing everyday at 

2695
01:56:09,171 --> 01:56:09,930
different and just one movie that you 
see or maybe two a day,

2696
01:56:09,960 --> 01:56:12,030
you see it one at a time,
you stream it,

2697
01:56:12,300 --> 01:56:13,860
you know,
you do it one at a time.

2698
01:56:14,040 --> 01:56:16,030
To me,
I,

2699
01:56:16,400 --> 01:56:21,400
I knew I had a feeling it was going to,
it's going to be that powerful when you 

2700
01:56:21,400 --> 01:56:24,831
watch it unfold.
But when we actually did Ebi wanting to 

2701
01:56:24,831 --> 01:56:24,831
man,
it was,

2702
01:56:24,831 --> 01:56:29,281
it was incredible to the people that 
were there were coming up to me and 

2703
01:56:29,281 --> 01:56:29,340
saying constantly.

2704
01:56:29,400 --> 01:56:32,100
And I mean they were saying that was the
best tournament I've ever seen.

2705
01:56:32,250 --> 01:56:35,850
It's only because they saw that way one 
match at a time.

2706
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:41,000
By the time they got the GL Martinez and
Jeff Glover in the final triple 

2707
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,320
overtime,
the place went nuts.

2708
01:56:43,590 --> 01:56:47,620
Do you think it's possible to do 
something like this and stream it like a

2709
01:56:47,670 --> 01:56:50,340
Netflix service?
We're a bunch of people already have the

2710
01:56:50,341 --> 01:56:52,200
service and all they have to do is just 
click on it,

2711
01:56:52,490 --> 01:56:57,490
you know,
or an apple TV type deal where a lot of 

2712
01:56:57,490 --> 01:56:58,530
people already have that.
Like if you get access to Netflix,

2713
01:56:58,531 --> 01:57:00,630
you get access to $70,
million homes.

2714
01:57:00,960 --> 01:57:03,330
There's still people that for whatever 
reason,

2715
01:57:03,331 --> 01:57:08,331
they don't have the ability to get the 
Internet on their TV so you don't get 

2716
01:57:08,331 --> 01:57:09,690
them.
But the people that do.

2717
01:57:09,691 --> 01:57:11,580
The people that have Internet connected 
TV,

2718
01:57:11,581 --> 01:57:13,800
a lot of fucking people have Netflix,
man.

2719
01:57:13,820 --> 01:57:14,370
Yeah.
So much.

2720
01:57:14,371 --> 01:57:17,940
So they're sponsoring television shows.
They're making their own shows.

2721
01:57:18,060 --> 01:57:20,880
They got this Marco Polo show that's 
pretty fucking dope dude.

2722
01:57:20,881 --> 01:57:25,881
And it's like a really expensive show.
Like you could tell they spent a lot of 

2723
01:57:25,881 --> 01:57:29,451
money making this thing.
I'm down to take Abi to the ultimate 

2724
01:57:29,451 --> 01:57:29,451
heights.
I just want.

2725
01:57:29,730 --> 01:57:34,730
I want you Jitsu on TV.
There's no reason why we can't have a 

2726
01:57:34,730 --> 01:57:35,340
Jujitsu TV on TV.
We have dog Frisbee,

2727
01:57:35,490 --> 01:57:39,250
we have all this crazy Frisbee dudes 
pulling tractor trailers with teeth.

2728
01:57:39,480 --> 01:57:40,170
Come on,
you can't.

2729
01:57:40,350 --> 01:57:44,160
You can't put metamorris on TV.
You can't put Abudabi on TV.

2730
01:57:44,280 --> 01:57:45,810
I think it just.
It's really simple.

2731
01:57:45,811 --> 01:57:48,190
It's got to be some mission only.
It's got to be Nogi.

2732
01:57:48,270 --> 01:57:50,840
If it's going to be on tv,
you ain't going to see on TV.

2733
01:57:50,850 --> 01:57:53,220
Have better chance putting chess on TV.
Yeah,

2734
01:57:53,221 --> 01:57:54,210
I agree with you with that.

2735
01:57:54,210 --> 01:57:59,210
There's just a lot of matches that wind 
up being stalemates where they're 

2736
01:57:59,210 --> 01:57:59,550
holding onto the collar and it's also.
It's,

2737
01:57:59,690 --> 01:58:03,090
it's as much as it's an interesting 
learning tool and it's a great.

2738
01:58:03,270 --> 01:58:08,270
It's great to learn that if you get in a
fight with someone who's got a winter 

2739
01:58:08,270 --> 01:58:11,001
coat on.
The reality is when we're looking at 

2740
01:58:11,001 --> 01:58:12,210
sport like combat sport,
we're looking at Jujitsu,

2741
01:58:12,360 --> 01:58:17,360
we're looking at Jujitsu and MMA.
They should be interchangeable and 

2742
01:58:17,360 --> 01:58:17,820
they're not.
They're not interchangeable.

2743
01:58:17,821 --> 01:58:19,880
When you have a gate,
they are when you have no gate,

2744
01:58:19,920 --> 01:58:22,350
so it seems pretty cut and dry straight 
forward.

2745
01:58:22,540 --> 01:58:27,540
I mean,
I think if someone just wants to do 

2746
01:58:27,540 --> 01:58:27,540
Jujitsu and ag,
it's fun to do.

2747
01:58:27,540 --> 01:58:27,540
It's great.
It's a great way to do it.

2748
01:58:27,540 --> 01:58:28,970
It's a good way to slow the game down.
You know,

2749
01:58:29,320 --> 01:58:31,590
a lot of older guys like it,
especially because of that reason.

2750
01:58:31,590 --> 01:58:34,080
It's like chess.
Chess is a great game to play.

2751
01:58:34,230 --> 01:58:35,910
You have to be really smart.
It's,

2752
01:58:35,911 --> 01:58:36,130
it's,
uh,

2753
01:58:36,220 --> 01:58:41,220
it's fun to play,
but you're not going to put it on Fox 

2754
01:58:41,220 --> 01:58:42,850
anytime soon.
Nothing wrong with Jujitsu with the gay.

2755
01:58:42,940 --> 01:58:45,820
But I agree that for the,
for Nogi,

2756
01:58:45,960 --> 01:58:50,960
like the difference between Nogi is it 
just smoothly transitions into mma 

2757
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:56,000
except for a few variables like the 
getting punched when you go in for leg 

2758
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,921
locks and stuff,
the UFC is the hottest rising sport on 

2759
01:58:58,921 --> 01:59:02,131
the planet.
There's millions and millions and 

2760
01:59:02,131 --> 01:59:02,260
millions of fans all over the world that
are rabid fans of the UFC.

2761
01:59:02,440 --> 01:59:06,780
There's no reason why there can't be 1 
million of those fans that are into Nogi

2762
01:59:06,780 --> 01:59:09,310
Jujitsu because really it's the same 
thing just without the striking.

2763
01:59:09,580 --> 01:59:14,580
It's on the ground.
It's the same objective during the same 

2764
01:59:14,580 --> 01:59:15,280
positions standing.
There's no striking,

2765
01:59:15,281 --> 01:59:20,281
but it's if you love mma,
you should be able to appreciate some 

2766
01:59:20,281 --> 01:59:22,000
good grappling his office as exciting.

2767
01:59:22,090 --> 01:59:23,200
The formats,
right.

2768
01:59:23,410 --> 01:59:25,810
There's no points and look,
you know,

2769
01:59:25,840 --> 01:59:30,840
it's a single matches.
There's no reason why you can get a 

2770
01:59:30,840 --> 01:59:32,380
fraction of all those UFC fans.
Realistically,

2771
01:59:32,381 --> 01:59:34,690
I'm low balling.
I don't know if it's done right.

2772
01:59:34,900 --> 01:59:39,220
If it's done right and marketed right,
I believe you can get 25 percent,

2773
01:59:39,221 --> 01:59:44,221
40 percent see there being some sort of 
a cable television show where they do 

2774
01:59:44,221 --> 01:59:44,221
it,
you know,

2775
01:59:44,221 --> 01:59:47,560
like a spike TV,
like spike TV has Friday night,

2776
01:59:47,561 --> 01:59:49,960
they have all combat sports now they 
have boxing,

2777
01:59:49,961 --> 01:59:53,260
they're having glory and then they have 
this TV.

2778
01:59:53,890 --> 01:59:56,740
That's why I got as many people have 
that.

2779
01:59:56,800 --> 02:00:00,160
That's a big drop.
Is it a big drop in access over spike of

2780
02:00:00,161 --> 02:00:01,780
giant drop?
Really big drop.

2781
02:00:02,220 --> 02:00:05,710
Spike is in way more households than 
access TV is millions and millions more.

2782
02:00:05,770 --> 02:00:06,670
Way More.
Yeah.

2783
02:00:06,910 --> 02:00:07,620
I mean,
I dunno,

2784
02:00:07,660 --> 02:00:10,060
maybe Jamie could find out the actual 
numbers,

2785
02:00:10,061 --> 02:00:12,650
but uh,
if I had to guess I'd have differences.

2786
02:00:12,650 --> 02:00:15,190
Probably like $50 million plus it'd be 
perfect on spike.

2787
02:00:15,340 --> 02:00:20,340
Yeah.
Well that kind of a place where you 

2788
02:00:20,340 --> 02:00:20,340
would get where people were already 
watching it,

2789
02:00:20,340 --> 02:00:21,070
you know they've already got it tuned 
in.

2790
02:00:21,071 --> 02:00:22,720
Not that there's anything wrong with 
access TV,

2791
02:00:22,930 --> 02:00:24,640
access TV.
He's got some awesome fights.

2792
02:00:24,641 --> 02:00:29,641
That's where you get lion fights like 
it's the only place where you could 

2793
02:00:29,641 --> 02:00:29,641
watch.
Not Lions.

2794
02:00:29,641 --> 02:00:31,050
Moitai.
You ever watch it live and what's that?

2795
02:00:31,051 --> 02:00:31,430
No,
no,

2796
02:00:31,431 --> 02:00:36,431
no.
Lion fight is probably the number one 

2797
02:00:36,431 --> 02:00:37,930
more tie organization in America as far 
as exposure because of television.

2798
02:00:38,170 --> 02:00:42,280
Like Kevin Ross was legit and boy guys 
with more rules bigger than glory.

2799
02:00:42,430 --> 02:00:43,470
No,
because it's.

2800
02:00:43,471 --> 02:00:46,060
Gloria is not Moitai.
Gloria's kickboxing.

2801
02:00:46,260 --> 02:00:48,350
The difference being you can't clench.
You can't throw a nice.

2802
02:00:48,360 --> 02:00:51,670
The body can throw elbows in the clench.
You can't do a lot of things that you do

2803
02:00:51,671 --> 02:00:56,671
in white tie,
like Moitai real more tied oftentimes 

2804
02:00:56,671 --> 02:01:00,451
winds up being a grapple fest where they
grab a hold of each other in a blast 

2805
02:01:00,451 --> 02:01:01,150
each other with knees to the body along 
the ropes.

2806
02:01:01,380 --> 02:01:04,300
Like that's a big part of [inaudible] if
you watch it in Thailand,

2807
02:01:04,330 --> 02:01:07,150
we watched some high level matches.
These guys clench up with each other and

2808
02:01:07,151 --> 02:01:09,220
they blast each other with the body.
They dump each other,

2809
02:01:09,221 --> 02:01:14,221
they sweep each other all the time and 
it's just a different thing when you're 

2810
02:01:14,221 --> 02:01:17,050
adding in knees and elbows and Gloria 
doesn't have that,

2811
02:01:17,051 --> 02:01:20,980
just like k one didn't have that k one.
You can only for a while you could throw

2812
02:01:20,981 --> 02:01:25,981
elbows with two knees,
but then a lot of dudes came over there 

2813
02:01:25,981 --> 02:01:25,981
and it just blasted guy or two,
uh,

2814
02:01:25,981 --> 02:01:29,050
two hands behind the head.
And then it became illegal to even throw

2815
02:01:29,051 --> 02:01:31,980
knees with two hands behind the head.
You can only use one hand behind that.

2816
02:01:32,140 --> 02:01:34,930
The owner of glory came to you and said,
Joe,

2817
02:01:34,990 --> 02:01:39,990
I respect your opinion.
What do you think we should do with the 

2818
02:01:39,990 --> 02:01:39,990
rules of surely go full moly.

2819
02:01:39,990 --> 02:01:40,970
Tie with 100 percent 
abso-fucking-lutely.

2820
02:01:41,050 --> 02:01:42,590
How long can they cleanse a better 
sport?

2821
02:01:42,620 --> 02:01:44,300
It's a sport.
It's more exciting.

2822
02:01:44,301 --> 02:01:49,301
It's the true art of standup.
The true art of standup involves 

2823
02:01:49,301 --> 02:01:50,690
throwing stand up,
throwing strikes in the clench,

2824
02:01:50,810 --> 02:01:55,810
throwing stuff like Moitai involves a 
lot of elbows in tight Moitai evolves 

2825
02:01:55,810 --> 02:01:59,680
manipulating bodies and leading people 
into knees leading like Allen Joe Ban,

2826
02:01:59,750 --> 02:02:04,750
perfect example and his last UFC bout 
the way turn that dude into that elbow 

2827
02:02:04,750 --> 02:02:09,490
that is more Thai applied to mma.
I mean it's a combination of grappling 

2828
02:02:09,490 --> 02:02:14,471
your opponent and striking and that's a 
big part of Moitai and you don't see 

2829
02:02:14,471 --> 02:02:18,851
that as much in glory because I think it
was along the lines of what they were 

2830
02:02:18,851 --> 02:02:19,120
trying to do with k one,
two.

2831
02:02:19,130 --> 02:02:22,640
They thought it would be make it more 
exciting if you had less clinching,

2832
02:02:22,880 --> 02:02:25,400
more exciting and the guys wouldn't get 
cut up,

2833
02:02:25,520 --> 02:02:27,320
which is what they're worried about for 
tournament's.

2834
02:02:27,470 --> 02:02:30,350
But I think tournament's was striking is
super fucking dangerous anyway.

2835
02:02:30,570 --> 02:02:33,890
I think they're asking for trouble by 
having a guy like Joe Schilling,

2836
02:02:33,891 --> 02:02:38,891
five three.
He's fighting Simon motherfucking 

2837
02:02:38,891 --> 02:02:38,891
Marcus,
you know,

2838
02:02:38,891 --> 02:02:41,000
and then after Simon mark is fucking 
fighting Wayne motherfucking Barrett.

2839
02:02:41,030 --> 02:02:44,560
And then after that he's fighting art 
and motherfucking 11 to three,

2840
02:02:44,630 --> 02:02:49,630
the baddest motherfuckers on earth.
And you're throwing head kicks and 

2841
02:02:49,630 --> 02:02:53,261
punches and elbow.
You can't have elbows in there because 

2842
02:02:53,261 --> 02:02:54,950
you get cut up.
So the the idea of tournament's,

2843
02:02:55,970 --> 02:03:00,970
you're preserving,
making sure the fights happen more 

2844
02:03:00,970 --> 02:03:00,970
often,
but you can do it.

2845
02:03:00,970 --> 02:03:01,430
You would've killed the kicking each 
other in the head.

2846
02:03:01,550 --> 02:03:04,850
Shin kicks the head cut.
You open like a fucking cerated knife.

2847
02:03:05,130 --> 02:03:10,130
I mean that can happen all the time 
because you're always going to wind the 

2848
02:03:10,130 --> 02:03:11,000
risk of the guy not being able to get 
into the finals if he gets head kicked.

2849
02:03:11,490 --> 02:03:14,630
No towards events into dangerous.
Bring back full time.

2850
02:03:14,720 --> 02:03:19,720
Full Moitai.
No tournament's use tournament's for 

2851
02:03:19,720 --> 02:03:19,720
grappling tournaments are awesome for 
Jujitsu,

2852
02:03:19,720 --> 02:03:24,190
for Ebi,
for Metamorris tournament to the way to 

2853
02:03:24,190 --> 02:03:24,190
go for,
for kickboxing,

2854
02:03:24,190 --> 02:03:26,480
100 percent Moitai.
It's a more effective art.

2855
02:03:26,510 --> 02:03:30,170
Is it too late for them to tweak?
Committed to these.

2856
02:03:30,180 --> 02:03:31,460
There's like,
like no,

2857
02:03:31,461 --> 02:03:32,990
it's never too late.
They own the company.

2858
02:03:33,140 --> 02:03:34,310
They own the company.
Switch it up.

2859
02:03:34,430 --> 02:03:35,700
Yeah,
they have bell tour.

2860
02:03:35,780 --> 02:03:38,480
Then they have a way more dangerous 
sport anyway.

2861
02:03:38,810 --> 02:03:43,810
As far as like with the public's 
perception would be because you're 

2862
02:03:43,810 --> 02:03:43,810
adding in takedowns and submissions,
you're just adding,

2863
02:03:43,810 --> 02:03:48,550
you're just adding elbows and knees.
They should totally be able to do that 

2864
02:03:48,550 --> 02:03:51,230
and then more time in the clench allow 
guys to clench because those guys like a

2865
02:03:51,231 --> 02:03:53,570
guy like Simon Marcus,
you take away his clinch,

2866
02:03:53,630 --> 02:03:55,160
you take away a big part of his game.

2867
02:03:55,190 --> 02:04:00,190
A lot of his game is.
He's a really strong guy who's 

2868
02:04:00,190 --> 02:04:00,190
excellent.
The plum.

2869
02:04:00,190 --> 02:04:02,240
He manipulates dudes and he's blasting 
you in the by boom,

2870
02:04:02,241 --> 02:04:04,160
boom.
That's a big part of his fucking game.

2871
02:04:04,161 --> 02:04:05,660
A huge part.
Elbows in the clench.

2872
02:04:05,870 --> 02:04:07,130
Those are.
That's a huge part.

2873
02:04:07,131 --> 02:04:12,131
You take that away and you're forcing 
them to just kick box and I just think 

2874
02:04:12,131 --> 02:04:12,200
it's not as good.
Still Fun.

2875
02:04:12,500 --> 02:04:13,970
Glories.
Awesome to watch.

2876
02:04:13,980 --> 02:04:18,980
Still exciting.
Just not as good as if it was like full 

2877
02:04:18,980 --> 02:04:18,980
more tyrell.
Damn.

2878
02:04:18,980 --> 02:04:20,090
I wonder if he's going to take that 
advice.

2879
02:04:20,091 --> 02:04:25,091
I hope so man,
because full Mike more tight rules is 

2880
02:04:25,091 --> 02:04:25,310
also way more technical.
You Watch and way more like you.

2881
02:04:25,311 --> 02:04:27,620
You never know what the fuck.
Like a guy like Kevin Ross,

2882
02:04:27,621 --> 02:04:28,850
he's a.
it's a perfect example.

2883
02:04:28,851 --> 02:04:32,300
He's a guy who fights total Thai style 
or like bull a cow.

2884
02:04:32,390 --> 02:04:35,300
When you see that guy,
use everything knees to the body,

2885
02:04:35,330 --> 02:04:38,000
elbows in the clench,
upward coming in,

2886
02:04:38,010 --> 02:04:43,010
step off to the side,
leg kicks across the front of the thigh 

2887
02:04:43,010 --> 02:04:43,010
to use in all these different 
techniques.

2888
02:04:43,010 --> 02:04:44,790
There's so many of the clench needs.
The body needs,

2889
02:04:44,791 --> 02:04:45,750
the body,
elbows,

2890
02:04:45,960 --> 02:04:47,900
all that stuff is a part of the sport 
and you,

2891
02:04:48,050 --> 02:04:49,680
you,
you try to make it more exciting.

2892
02:04:49,690 --> 02:04:54,690
That's when elite ECC were saying that 
you'd go to the ground but only for 15 

2893
02:04:54,690 --> 02:04:55,460
seconds and then you have to stay on 
your backup.

2894
02:04:55,480 --> 02:04:57,030
We're like,
this isn't fucking mma.

2895
02:04:57,330 --> 02:05:02,330
When big country had our Laski down and 
he was working at Kamora and they stood 

2896
02:05:02,330 --> 02:05:04,290
him up from side control.
He's inside control.

2897
02:05:04,350 --> 02:05:09,350
He's got the risk pin down.
He's feeding his arm through and he's 

2898
02:05:09,350 --> 02:05:11,130
about to try to attempt to comorbidity.
They're standing up and we're like,

2899
02:05:11,131 --> 02:05:16,131
what the fuck is this?
How many times where it was there a bad 

2900
02:05:16,131 --> 02:05:16,920
stand up during a UFC fight?

2901
02:05:16,920 --> 02:05:18,930
When I was in your ear and I'm like,
Oh my God,

2902
02:05:19,080 --> 02:05:20,760
Oh my God,
what the fuck?

2903
02:05:20,880 --> 02:05:23,330
And then all of a sudden you start,
you start,

2904
02:05:24,360 --> 02:05:26,880
you let it.
I love anytime there's a quick setup.

2905
02:05:26,970 --> 02:05:31,970
Anytime there's any standup,
I love it when you say something I 

2906
02:05:31,970 --> 02:05:33,900
shouldn't be at all exists.
It's only five minutes.

2907
02:05:34,140 --> 02:05:39,140
You have five minutes to get a guy to 
the ground and submit them and the guys 

2908
02:05:39,140 --> 02:05:41,810
trying to kick your fucking head off the
idea that you should be stood back up 

2909
02:05:41,810 --> 02:05:41,810
because it's boring.
Look,

2910
02:05:41,810 --> 02:05:43,440
if it's boring,
then you know what's going to happen.

2911
02:05:43,650 --> 02:05:45,930
Less people going to buy your paper view
less.

2912
02:05:45,931 --> 02:05:47,670
People are going to pay to see you 
fight.

2913
02:05:47,940 --> 02:05:50,670
You're going to make less money.
If you want to finish guys,

2914
02:05:50,671 --> 02:05:53,520
you're going to make more money.
The market should dictate your style.

2915
02:05:54,020 --> 02:05:57,300
The rules should be the rules of 
fighting and fighting.

2916
02:05:57,390 --> 02:06:02,390
Sometimes a guy like ben asked when can 
hold you down and do whatever the fuck 

2917
02:06:02,390 --> 02:06:05,070
he wants and the idea that you get to be
stood up.

2918
02:06:05,071 --> 02:06:07,560
You get a second shot at kicking his 
fucking teeth in.

2919
02:06:07,690 --> 02:06:08,360
No,
he took,

2920
02:06:09,180 --> 02:06:10,620
he took you down,
he held you down.

2921
02:06:10,621 --> 02:06:15,621
Especially when every.
Especially when every Ralph start 

2922
02:06:15,621 --> 02:06:16,490
standing up for the striker.
Exactly.

2923
02:06:17,490 --> 02:06:21,060
If you wanted a to lead that fight 
company,

2924
02:06:21,061 --> 02:06:26,061
that was totally fair.
When the fight ends up there on the 

2925
02:06:26,061 --> 02:06:29,721
ground in the amount,
the next round should start just like 

2926
02:06:29,721 --> 02:06:29,721
that.
And the amount,

2927
02:06:29,721 --> 02:06:30,080
right?
Yes.

2928
02:06:30,160 --> 02:06:32,670
Now you starting standing up again and 
you know what I think.

2929
02:06:32,671 --> 02:06:37,671
I think it would be more exciting.
I think if they just let the market 

2930
02:06:37,671 --> 02:06:38,160
dictate,
just let it decide.

2931
02:06:38,161 --> 02:06:40,770
Just the rules.
Make it more primitive,

2932
02:06:40,950 --> 02:06:43,860
make less rules,
get the f out of the mix,

2933
02:06:43,960 --> 02:06:48,960
get them out mixed with block subjective
tires and they're like,

2934
02:06:49,870 --> 02:06:53,700
whatever subjective ideas he has,
what's what's good or what's not?

2935
02:06:53,820 --> 02:06:54,840
Come on guys.
You gotta fight.

2936
02:06:54,930 --> 02:06:55,890
I go crazy.
I'm like,

2937
02:06:55,891 --> 02:06:57,960
they're fighting with the fuck.
Do you think they're doing?

2938
02:06:58,140 --> 02:07:00,420
You see that guy,
me and that guy in the leg that's called

2939
02:07:00,421 --> 02:07:03,450
fighting or is telling the rough,
make them fight.

2940
02:07:04,580 --> 02:07:06,540
That was the Gary Shaw thing in the 
taxi.

2941
02:07:06,690 --> 02:07:11,100
He told them to stand people up.
So you've got guys like Orlowski wind up

2942
02:07:11,101 --> 02:07:16,101
knocking big country out,
which is kind of fucked up because big 

2943
02:07:16,101 --> 02:07:17,160
country was dominating that fight and if
they stayed on the ground,

2944
02:07:17,220 --> 02:07:18,870
he probably would have stayed on top of 
him.

2945
02:07:19,020 --> 02:07:21,270
I don't see our last people reversing 
big country,

2946
02:07:21,510 --> 02:07:23,220
big countries.
Jujitsu is legit.

2947
02:07:23,340 --> 02:07:28,340
He's a big fucking strong dude.
He's working for a position that he 

2948
02:07:28,340 --> 02:07:28,620
earned.
He got you to the ground.

2949
02:07:28,621 --> 02:07:31,290
It's fucking hard to do that.
We'll grow lawsky.

2950
02:07:31,350 --> 02:07:36,350
You get them to the ground,
you get them inside control and some 

2951
02:07:36,350 --> 02:07:39,230
fucking sole job of a promoter decides 
that you have to stand these guys up 

2952
02:07:39,280 --> 02:07:40,480
because they want war.

2953
02:07:40,840 --> 02:07:42,920
The crowd wants war.
We're fighting.

2954
02:07:43,090 --> 02:07:47,680
We're not spit and fucking Salami 
sandwiches flying out of his mouth is.

2955
02:07:47,681 --> 02:07:50,380
He's talking.
That guy gets to dictate what happens in

2956
02:07:50,381 --> 02:07:53,050
a professional martial arts event.
That's insane.

2957
02:07:54,250 --> 02:07:59,250
How crazy would it be if there was a 
lead that took out standups and you 

2958
02:07:59,250 --> 02:08:00,730
started the next round?
Exactly.

2959
02:08:00,731 --> 02:08:02,590
In the same spot.
How hard would that be?

2960
02:08:02,591 --> 02:08:03,790
Hard.
Is that hard?

2961
02:08:03,800 --> 02:08:04,170
No.
No,

2962
02:08:04,420 --> 02:08:05,470
no.
Not only that,

2963
02:08:05,471 --> 02:08:07,300
that's how it should be.
That's how it should be.

2964
02:08:07,301 --> 02:08:10,240
If people want to have a break,
if you want to get back up,

2965
02:08:10,330 --> 02:08:12,070
you shouldn't have to work to get back 
up.

2966
02:08:12,210 --> 02:08:15,340
If a guy takes you down and he's got 
your fucking you mounted,

2967
02:08:15,341 --> 02:08:17,230
he's just punching your face and the 
buzzer rings.

2968
02:08:17,680 --> 02:08:20,920
She didn't solve that.
You didn't solve that issue.

2969
02:08:21,250 --> 02:08:22,150
Got An issue,
man.

2970
02:08:22,151 --> 02:08:22,950
You've got a guy on top.

2971
02:08:22,970 --> 02:08:24,910
You punched in the face.
If this is on the school yard,

2972
02:08:24,911 --> 02:08:28,660
if this isn't a fucking field somewhere,
that guy would still be on top of you.

2973
02:08:28,740 --> 02:08:29,570
Yup.
So look,

2974
02:08:29,660 --> 02:08:34,660
we're going to give you a minute to get 
your cardio back to make it more 

2975
02:08:34,660 --> 02:08:34,660
exciting,
but that's it.

2976
02:08:34,660 --> 02:08:34,660
And even that,
guess what?

2977
02:08:34,720 --> 02:08:37,660
That's a little suspect.
You'd be the fight should be 10 minutes.

2978
02:08:37,780 --> 02:08:42,780
Maybe the presenter,
many fight should be 10 minutes and the 

2979
02:08:42,780 --> 02:08:43,540
main events should be 15 or 20.
No fucking breaks.

2980
02:08:43,541 --> 02:08:45,040
Hey,
I'm down with that hell breaks.

2981
02:08:45,100 --> 02:08:46,390
That would be.
That's real.

2982
02:08:46,391 --> 02:08:48,910
MMA.
MMA is not rounds.

2983
02:08:49,030 --> 02:08:50,450
You know?
I know the girls would get upset.

2984
02:08:50,470 --> 02:08:52,330
They don't get to walk around every five
minutes.

2985
02:08:52,331 --> 02:08:57,331
Their jobs.
They would still be there at the 

2986
02:08:57,331 --> 02:08:57,850
beginning and the end.
It would just be a few less of these,

2987
02:08:58,960 --> 02:09:00,350
a few less.
I don't think it's.

2988
02:09:00,600 --> 02:09:03,160
They still are an integral part of the 
organization.

2989
02:09:03,161 --> 02:09:04,600
They're beautiful.
They're fun to be around.

2990
02:09:04,601 --> 02:09:06,760
Nothing wrong with octagon girls.
Nothing wrong.

2991
02:09:06,761 --> 02:09:09,220
It's not an anti octagon grow rant.
I love those girls.

2992
02:09:09,280 --> 02:09:11,720
It's importance of freight.
Where's listed?

2993
02:09:11,780 --> 02:09:14,800
Where's the cage answers in a ring card 
girl is at your event.

2994
02:09:14,810 --> 02:09:16,510
Then we're going to use dudes.
You know,

2995
02:09:16,511 --> 02:09:19,960
we're trying to make it more friendly 
for gays,

2996
02:09:21,400 --> 02:09:24,540
transgenders,
straight people that like watching dudes

2997
02:09:24,550 --> 02:09:28,090
in their underwear.
There's not a good representation of the

2998
02:09:28,091 --> 02:09:30,430
male form.
There's a small market.

2999
02:09:30,431 --> 02:09:35,431
You know there's,
there's a huge gay Brazilian Jujitsu to 

3000
02:09:35,431 --> 02:09:35,431
community in West Hollywood.
You know that right?

3001
02:09:35,431 --> 02:09:36,970
They go to all the local tournament.
They show up.

3002
02:09:36,971 --> 02:09:40,050
They got the rainbow geese.
I haven't.

3003
02:09:40,080 --> 02:09:43,900
I haven't spoken with you.
I could smile that he can't hold.

3004
02:09:43,901 --> 02:09:46,120
Sometimes you gotta look the corners of 
his mouth,

3005
02:09:46,121 --> 02:09:46,960
they start shaking.

3006
02:09:47,180 --> 02:09:48,650
It's just keep it together.
Mr Brown,

3007
02:09:48,680 --> 02:09:51,310
you believe for a second that I believe.
Sure.

3008
02:09:53,030 --> 02:09:54,680
So it works.
We'll get,

3009
02:09:54,710 --> 02:09:58,090
you know,
there will be some day it keeps going.

3010
02:09:58,160 --> 02:10:00,370
There will be gay guys are notoriously 
fit.

3011
02:10:00,490 --> 02:10:01,090
Hey,
why would,

3012
02:10:01,240 --> 02:10:04,320
why wouldn't a gay guy won a Jujitsu?
Right?

3013
02:10:04,360 --> 02:10:09,360
You got to roll with other dudes.
Come on and get into the missionary you 

3014
02:10:09,360 --> 02:10:10,500
to take their bags,
balls in their face to.

3015
02:10:10,510 --> 02:10:12,880
A lot of times they should be obsessed 
with.

3016
02:10:12,881 --> 02:10:16,180
It should be there probably on their 
national sport.

3017
02:10:16,240 --> 02:10:18,280
Maybe this is going to inspire them to 
come clean with it.

3018
02:10:18,670 --> 02:10:23,670
Maybe there's a lot of dudes out there.
You're going to just take the regular 

3019
02:10:23,670 --> 02:10:24,340
day off and they got a Rambo underneath.
I have nothing against gay guys.

3020
02:10:24,341 --> 02:10:27,460
I'm sure I have like five or six gay 
guys in high school.

3021
02:10:28,380 --> 02:10:30,850
Hey,
I'm not racist,

3022
02:10:30,851 --> 02:10:35,851
but it's just don't get boners while you
roll and everything will be fine.

3023
02:10:38,200 --> 02:10:41,210
The Gay version of,
I'm not racist but racing,

3024
02:10:41,260 --> 02:10:45,470
but why not homophobic?
But if you roll with me,

3025
02:10:45,471 --> 02:10:48,650
don't get a hard on because I am fucking
beautiful.

3026
02:10:48,880 --> 02:10:50,270
It's like what you're saying.
You're saying,

3027
02:10:50,280 --> 02:10:55,280
how could you not get a little bit?
A little guy gets hard.

3028
02:10:56,001 --> 02:10:57,270
You're still gonna roll with it.
No,

3029
02:10:57,300 --> 02:11:00,870
no.
You can say your.

3030
02:11:00,900 --> 02:11:05,900
Your contact or contact only homophobic.
If you expect the guy to get hard and 

3031
02:11:05,901 --> 02:11:07,790
you're upset before the match even 
starts,

3032
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:11,210
you gotta let the guy have the 
opportunity to get hard and they say,

3033
02:11:11,211 --> 02:11:14,060
hey man,
can you can't like start off going,

3034
02:11:14,061 --> 02:11:14,940
hey man,
don't get hard.

3035
02:11:14,941 --> 02:11:16,640
If we wrestle like,
fuck dude,

3036
02:11:16,700 --> 02:11:17,960
that's like hanging out with the black 
dude.

3037
02:11:17,961 --> 02:11:18,350
Go here,
move.

3038
02:11:18,370 --> 02:11:21,530
Don't rub me like.
And he's like out.

3039
02:11:21,940 --> 02:11:24,980
I think only gay white belts get hard 
ons.

3040
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:27,050
I think my blue belt,
he learned to control it.

3041
02:11:27,210 --> 02:11:28,610
I think there's a lot of gay white 
belts.

3042
02:11:28,670 --> 02:11:30,330
Don't get hard at all.
I think you're at a lot.

3043
02:11:31,220 --> 02:11:34,220
I'm just saying generally dennis will.
Have you ever gotten a hard rolling with

3044
02:11:34,221 --> 02:11:35,180
the girl?
Never.

3045
02:11:35,290 --> 02:11:36,470
There you go.
That's what I'm saying.

3046
02:11:36,660 --> 02:11:41,660
And you wanted the horniest people 
that's ever walked the face of the 

3047
02:11:41,660 --> 02:11:41,950
planet.
But I'm rolling with girls like every.

3048
02:11:42,350 --> 02:11:47,350
There's hardly no girls frequency.
You'd get more talking about zero 

3049
02:11:47,350 --> 02:11:49,970
percent going to go up.
To say that Hugh Jitsu was the opposite.

3050
02:11:49,971 --> 02:11:54,971
If we lived in the twilight zone and 98 
percent of the people doing Jujitsu for 

3051
02:11:54,971 --> 02:11:56,420
women,
and I was one of them rare dudes,

3052
02:11:56,930 --> 02:11:57,950
I'd be like,
hell yeah,

3053
02:11:57,951 --> 02:12:00,410
I'm going to do Jujitsu forever.
That's how probably girls feel,

3054
02:12:00,411 --> 02:12:05,411
right?
Just get mauled all the time by giant 

3055
02:12:05,411 --> 02:12:05,411
dudes.
Hey,

3056
02:12:05,411 --> 02:12:06,890
who said that?
Jesus Christ.

3057
02:12:07,040 --> 02:12:11,050
Why she entering the heavyweight class 
girls,

3058
02:12:11,150 --> 02:12:12,040
girls that dishes here too.

3059
02:12:12,050 --> 02:12:13,430
They're like,
Oh,

3060
02:12:13,431 --> 02:12:18,431
these guys are geniuses.
We get choked.

3061
02:12:18,870 --> 02:12:23,540
Her attention is incredible,
but she finds herself in north south all

3062
02:12:23,541 --> 02:12:25,580
the time.
It's so weird.

3063
02:12:25,581 --> 02:12:27,140
It's ridiculous.
Makes Sense.

3064
02:12:27,620 --> 02:12:32,620
Like she's so good at retaining garbage.
It almost seems like she turns into 

3065
02:12:32,620 --> 02:12:32,990
north south from the bottom.
I don't understand what's happening.

3066
02:12:33,390 --> 02:12:35,240
Oh,
that's a crazy sport.

3067
02:12:35,241 --> 02:12:37,070
It's a craziest pillow boy.
First girl,

3068
02:12:37,330 --> 02:12:39,140
first girl.
When I was a purple belt,

3069
02:12:39,141 --> 02:12:40,540
I brought.
Did you get to to.

3070
02:12:40,580 --> 02:12:42,920
She wanted to watch.
She couldn't believe that she got.

3071
02:12:43,220 --> 02:12:46,310
She was sweating.
She couldn't believe to her.

3072
02:12:46,311 --> 02:12:49,250
She just saw sexual positions.
That's all she saw was.

3073
02:12:49,520 --> 02:12:54,170
How do you guys do this?
She was turned on by guys wrestling with

3074
02:12:54,171 --> 02:12:55,140
guys.
Guys.

3075
02:12:55,220 --> 02:12:57,020
Some girls like that,
some girls do.

3076
02:12:57,590 --> 02:12:59,630
Girls want to find out who wins.
Take a sperm.

3077
02:13:00,200 --> 02:13:02,100
That's what they want to do.
You know some guys,

3078
02:13:02,580 --> 02:13:07,580
some guys,
some guys like two dudes getting gay 

3079
02:13:07,580 --> 02:13:07,790
together,
some girls like that,

3080
02:13:08,930 --> 02:13:09,290
right?

3081
02:13:10,400 --> 02:13:11,750
Dude,
no comment on that one.

3082
02:13:11,780 --> 02:13:13,020
No clue.
Yes.

3083
02:13:13,490 --> 02:13:15,070
Well we have a woman in the room,
I'll tell you.

3084
02:13:15,190 --> 02:13:20,190
Ordain will tell us she's nodding.
So I think girls do you know girls that 

3085
02:13:20,190 --> 02:13:21,560
uh,
are not gay,

3086
02:13:21,561 --> 02:13:24,560
but somehow two gay guys getting 
together turns them on.

3087
02:13:24,840 --> 02:13:27,050
Same in France.
In Italy.

3088
02:13:27,710 --> 02:13:28,490
In Italy.
Yeah.

3089
02:13:28,520 --> 02:13:29,470
Bitches.
Crazy.

3090
02:13:29,480 --> 02:13:34,480
Those are crazy.
Say Twenty percent of women that you 

3091
02:13:34,480 --> 02:13:38,031
know,
maybe higher and it turns you on.

3092
02:13:38,900 --> 02:13:41,340
You don't want to laugh.
You're not watching to laugh.

3093
02:13:41,460 --> 02:13:43,790
Gay Girl Porn or gay men porn.
Why?

3094
02:13:44,050 --> 02:13:49,050
We got to end this conversation.
I throw us about the throat microphone I

3095
02:13:51,140 --> 02:13:56,140
mailed.
It was through watching some dude balls 

3096
02:13:56,140 --> 02:13:56,820
deep in another guy's ass and a girl 
playing with herself.

3097
02:13:57,030 --> 02:14:00,450
That's the last two month.
Egos are so strong.

3098
02:14:00,860 --> 02:14:05,580
It's so important for us to not get 
dominated by another man.

3099
02:14:05,880 --> 02:14:08,040
You're like,
his balls are right here.

3100
02:14:08,130 --> 02:14:13,130
I don't give a fuck.
I'm going almost stop the choke right 

3101
02:14:13,130 --> 02:14:13,130
here and his balls are right here.
You're like,

3102
02:14:13,130 --> 02:14:14,730
that doesn't mean shit.
It's going to hurt more.

3103
02:14:14,731 --> 02:14:17,340
If he taps me,
then have his balls hit my cheek.

3104
02:14:17,840 --> 02:14:19,290
Just like blocking the chuck.
Right?

3105
02:14:20,070 --> 02:14:25,070
It's more important.
You're not thinking about any sexuality 

3106
02:14:25,070 --> 02:14:25,070
at all.
In Jujitsu,

3107
02:14:25,070 --> 02:14:25,070
you're thinking about not getting 
tapped.

3108
02:14:25,070 --> 02:14:26,400
You Band,
Tie Cups,

3109
02:14:26,401 --> 02:14:29,130
those steel cups.
Don't bet anything.

3110
02:14:29,460 --> 02:14:34,460
You don't.
You allow guys to wear those steel 

3111
02:14:34,460 --> 02:14:34,460
companies,
what they wear,

3112
02:14:34,460 --> 02:14:36,771
whatever they want.
I'm not going to stop them from 

3113
02:14:36,771 --> 02:14:36,771
protecting their balls,
you know,

3114
02:14:36,771 --> 02:14:37,460
but it's not that.
The idea is there's leverage.

3115
02:14:37,480 --> 02:14:38,940
Yeah.
Do you believe that Gary,

3116
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:40,830
that it's increased leverage anywhere?
A Steel Cup?

3117
02:14:42,540 --> 02:14:44,340
Certainly more efficiently.
Break arms,

3118
02:14:44,341 --> 02:14:46,260
legs.
Do you wear one?

3119
02:14:46,420 --> 02:14:47,100
No,
I don't want one.

3120
02:14:47,130 --> 02:14:48,420
When I compete,
I just never have.

3121
02:14:48,421 --> 02:14:49,020
So it would.

3122
02:14:49,110 --> 02:14:51,230
It would be awkward to start doing it 
right before.

3123
02:14:51,260 --> 02:14:52,830
It seems like there'll be a massive 
benefit.

3124
02:14:52,831 --> 02:14:54,060
If it's illegal,
would be some.

3125
02:14:54,120 --> 02:14:57,360
Some organizations been cups in it.
Totally.

3126
02:14:57,380 --> 02:14:59,270
Yay.
Because it'll leverage.

3127
02:14:59,370 --> 02:15:01,290
God Damn it.
I got another Einstein Story.

3128
02:15:01,291 --> 02:15:04,950
Einstein was passing my guard and he hit
my Dick with his knee.

3129
02:15:05,370 --> 02:15:07,410
I didn't think anything of it until I 
went to the bathroom.

3130
02:15:07,411 --> 02:15:09,900
After I was done rolling in.
My jock strap was filled with blood.

3131
02:15:10,090 --> 02:15:13,740
Mr.
couple years now and so I started.

3132
02:15:13,741 --> 02:15:15,720
I,
I peed and blood came out of my Dick.

3133
02:15:15,721 --> 02:15:17,040
I'm like fuck.
And I was trying to think,

3134
02:15:17,070 --> 02:15:19,230
should I go to the doctor because I knew
if I went to the doctor,

3135
02:15:19,231 --> 02:15:19,950
like I'll go,
okay,

3136
02:15:19,951 --> 02:15:21,450
what would I do?
If it was my nose,

3137
02:15:21,780 --> 02:15:23,040
I go,
why wouldn't go to the doctor?

3138
02:15:23,130 --> 02:15:28,130
I would see what's going on.
So I went home and a little bit more 

3139
02:15:28,130 --> 02:15:28,130
important than your nose though.

3140
02:15:28,130 --> 02:15:28,500
It is,
but I went on when I jerked off,

3141
02:15:28,501 --> 02:15:33,501
I just want to make sure my dick works 
in my sperm was like the cover of the 

3142
02:15:34,141 --> 02:15:36,420
metallica album load.
It's blood and sperm.

3143
02:15:36,480 --> 02:15:38,580
It was like one of them chicken eggs 
where something went wrong,

3144
02:15:38,970 --> 02:15:40,230
you know,
you get one of those chicken eggs,

3145
02:15:40,231 --> 02:15:41,790
it's got a little fetus in it or 
something.

3146
02:15:41,940 --> 02:15:43,200
That's what it was like.
It was clumps,

3147
02:15:43,530 --> 02:15:47,730
but it worked out.
It did work out and then I peed.

3148
02:15:47,970 --> 02:15:50,220
The next day was I had blood for a few 
days though.

3149
02:15:50,310 --> 02:15:52,050
It was blood that was coming out for a 
few days,

3150
02:15:52,200 --> 02:15:53,880
but it never got infected.
I was like,

3151
02:15:54,030 --> 02:15:59,030
if it feels infected,
I'm going to the doctor because 

3152
02:15:59,030 --> 02:15:59,030
otherwise they're gonna be staring at my
Dick.

3153
02:15:59,030 --> 02:16:02,851
It's going to be awkward.
They going to put q tips up there and 

3154
02:16:02,851 --> 02:16:02,851
then probably say nothing.
You're probably not going to do anything

3155
02:16:02,851 --> 02:16:02,851
for you.

3156
02:16:03,040 --> 02:16:08,040
So I was like,
you made the right call and is cops are 

3157
02:16:08,040 --> 02:16:08,040
the way to go because that shit wouldn't
have happened.

3158
02:16:08,040 --> 02:16:09,640
Yeah.
Especially like a steel cup.

3159
02:16:09,720 --> 02:16:12,540
Constantly squeezing my knees and every 
part of my game,

3160
02:16:12,541 --> 02:16:17,541
the needs are generally squeezing,
so I'm in constant protect ball mode 

3161
02:16:17,541 --> 02:16:18,870
anyway.
So you don't wear makeup?

3162
02:16:19,060 --> 02:16:20,760
Never.
Do you ever wear one of those diamonds?

3163
02:16:20,840 --> 02:16:22,980
You ever try those diamond and try it 
and never.

3164
02:16:23,010 --> 02:16:24,600
Would you be interested in trying?
I got them here.

3165
02:16:24,750 --> 02:16:29,750
You want one?
I'm afraid balls are going to hang out 

3166
02:16:29,750 --> 02:16:29,860
and then someone's gonna Smash.
My mom like vandelay Silva.

3167
02:16:29,920 --> 02:16:33,130
It's like compression shorts.
I met Gilbert Ivo vandelay Silva us,

3168
02:16:33,131 --> 02:16:38,131
right.
The ball got caught after that guy was 

3169
02:16:38,131 --> 02:16:39,430
laying on the floor longer than that 
pain.

3170
02:16:39,431 --> 02:16:41,680
You know that pain you get where you 
feel like you're going to get sick.

3171
02:16:41,950 --> 02:16:44,560
He had other kind of pain,
like a ball smashed.

3172
02:16:44,560 --> 02:16:45,550
I remember that.
Well there.

3173
02:16:45,570 --> 02:16:47,620
I think he had a regular cup,
those regular cups,

3174
02:16:47,621 --> 02:16:50,530
so this is way before they had these 
compression short cups.

3175
02:16:50,830 --> 02:16:55,830
There's a couple of companies,
Jocko does them to a couple of 

3176
02:16:55,830 --> 02:16:55,830
companies,
but diamond mma,

3177
02:16:55,830 --> 02:16:57,250
I think they started it.
They have a cop that's contoured.

3178
02:16:57,490 --> 02:16:58,690
Jamie,
go grab one of those things.

3179
02:16:58,720 --> 02:17:00,490
They need to take a bunch of them.
They sent them to me.

3180
02:17:00,550 --> 02:17:02,140
They don't have any affiliation with 
this company.

3181
02:17:02,141 --> 02:17:06,160
I just want to say they need to take a 
mold of your Dick and then make a mold.

3182
02:17:06,250 --> 02:17:08,270
Rubber Jelly thing.
No,

3183
02:17:09,040 --> 02:17:09,370
no,
no,

3184
02:17:09,371 --> 02:17:10,270
no.
Where it's soft.

3185
02:17:10,480 --> 02:17:11,980
I thought about what if you.
Dick gets hard.

3186
02:17:12,190 --> 02:17:14,770
It gets trapped and it's like you're 
choking your dick out.

3187
02:17:15,100 --> 02:17:16,730
You're to question.
That's we haven't.

3188
02:17:17,940 --> 02:17:19,840
He wants to make like mouthpieces.
Yeah,

3189
02:17:19,910 --> 02:17:24,910
like a mouthpiece,
like an earpiece mouthpiece or one of 

3190
02:17:24,910 --> 02:17:24,910
those ear.

3191
02:17:24,910 --> 02:17:26,890
You just can't ever get turned on.
Yeah.

3192
02:17:27,400 --> 02:17:28,690
Yeah.
So this is why would you.

3193
02:17:28,691 --> 02:17:30,850
It's Jujitsu.
It's other sweaty dudes.

3194
02:17:30,851 --> 02:17:33,030
See they have a cup that's kind of 
contoured.

3195
02:17:33,080 --> 02:17:34,690
And Scott,
so this is.

3196
02:17:34,691 --> 02:17:35,680
No,
I don't think that's the way to go.

3197
02:17:35,681 --> 02:17:39,640
The whole idea that the point is if your
Dick is hanging out,

3198
02:17:39,641 --> 02:17:40,780
I'm telling you,
dude,

3199
02:17:40,781 --> 02:17:43,300
you were with these compression shorts.
These shorts are crazy.

3200
02:17:43,301 --> 02:17:48,301
They have all these straps in them and 
it's all the suck that thing right up 

3201
02:17:48,301 --> 02:17:49,150
against your junk.
I need to protect your hawks on.

3202
02:17:49,270 --> 02:17:51,880
You don't need to do it.
Not Outside your pants.

3203
02:17:52,360 --> 02:17:52,970
It's just too.

3204
02:17:56,260 --> 02:17:58,530
I'm not saying I got a big.
I'm just saying it's thick.

3205
02:17:59,170 --> 02:18:02,290
It's bigger than this.
It's not that big.

3206
02:18:02,291 --> 02:18:04,120
It's this thick.
It's bigger than that.

3207
02:18:04,150 --> 02:18:05,770
That's all you're saying,
but you should try it.

3208
02:18:06,010 --> 02:18:11,010
It's a good idea.
You don't need a commentator to match a 

3209
02:18:11,010 --> 02:18:11,110
Louis Fernando Vasconcellos and king of 
the cage,

3210
02:18:11,111 --> 02:18:13,600
and I forgot about Fernando against 
Shonie.

3211
02:18:13,601 --> 02:18:18,601
Carter and Carter showed up at the cup,
like it looked like actually sit on the 

3212
02:18:18,601 --> 02:18:18,601
telecast.
I go,

3213
02:18:18,601 --> 02:18:19,030
you know,
uh,

3214
02:18:19,610 --> 02:18:21,070
uh,
Bob Sapp called,

3215
02:18:21,071 --> 02:18:25,390
he wanted his cut back,
his cup of so tremendous.

3216
02:18:25,540 --> 02:18:30,540
That was a weapon.
It was like something that you'd wear 

3217
02:18:30,540 --> 02:18:31,540
the like Mad Max and Shit.
You know what I mean?

3218
02:18:31,960 --> 02:18:36,960
Like anybody tried to kick him in the 
balls and there's like blades and shit 

3219
02:18:36,960 --> 02:18:36,960
or something.
It was huge.

3220
02:18:36,960 --> 02:18:40,950
But when you wrote with a guy who's got 
one on a steel cup and they get on top 

3221
02:18:40,950 --> 02:18:40,950
of you,
you could feel that thing.

3222
02:18:40,950 --> 02:18:42,730
It's like a weapon.
Like they're fucking.

3223
02:18:42,731 --> 02:18:45,310
You heard somebody ribs or combat like,
yeah,

3224
02:18:45,311 --> 02:18:47,680
you hurt your sternum,
your solar plexus,

3225
02:18:47,950 --> 02:18:48,300
your like,
you,

3226
02:18:48,310 --> 02:18:51,010
you want to get out of that position and
an arm bars.

3227
02:18:51,040 --> 02:18:54,460
It's got to make a giant difference.
It's a big chunk of metal knee bars.

3228
02:18:54,720 --> 02:18:59,720
It's almost like an angle.
There's an angle like you have a 

3229
02:18:59,720 --> 02:19:02,611
leverage point where your Dick and how 
about you put a dude in a triangle and 

3230
02:19:02,611 --> 02:19:06,130
you owe angle on their face is right in 
that anytime you put a dude in a 

3231
02:19:06,130 --> 02:19:08,680
triangle and you're like,
his head's just in the wrong angle.

3232
02:19:08,681 --> 02:19:12,670
Like if you pull this head,
you're just like stuffing his head one.

3233
02:19:13,090 --> 02:19:18,090
Is it worth it?
I'm going to try to tap them with like 

3234
02:19:18,090 --> 02:19:18,320
an arm or something here.
That was one of the match.

3235
02:19:18,321 --> 02:19:20,400
Didn't want to talk to you about.
Is Your Hobby Vasquez mad?

3236
02:19:20,430 --> 02:19:20,860
Yeah.
Yeah.

3237
02:19:20,920 --> 02:19:25,920
Dude,
that was such a slick submission man 

3238
02:19:25,920 --> 02:19:25,920
because you,
you,

3239
02:19:25,920 --> 02:19:27,860
you're known for your leg locks and it's
kind of like hobby was defending.

3240
02:19:27,861 --> 02:19:28,340
Well

3241
02:19:28,370 --> 02:19:31,760
an obvious really good defense anyway,
and then you switched it up and went for

3242
02:19:31,761 --> 02:19:33,740
that triangle and cut the triangle on 
the side.

3243
02:19:35,460 --> 02:19:40,460
As I move forward with my matches and 
things like there's certain situations 

3244
02:19:40,460 --> 02:19:43,661
where I'm just at all costs trying to 
submit somebody and beat them in 

3245
02:19:43,661 --> 02:19:44,660
whatever way that I possibly can.
I specifically in that match,

3246
02:19:44,690 --> 02:19:47,690
I had every intention because I had just
beaten like a really good leg locker.

3247
02:19:47,691 --> 02:19:52,691
Marcin held.
I had every intention of trying to not 

3248
02:19:52,691 --> 02:19:53,870
submit them with a leg lock real.
Uh,

3249
02:19:53,871 --> 02:19:54,650
I didn't.
Yeah,

3250
02:19:54,651 --> 02:19:57,530
I didn't want to because I don't want to
be known as,

3251
02:19:57,560 --> 02:19:59,750
I don't want to be known as just the guy
that does leg locks,

3252
02:19:59,751 --> 02:20:04,751
you know what I mean?
I want to be known as a fucking killer 

3253
02:20:04,751 --> 02:20:04,751
on the map getting.
But still,

3254
02:20:04,751 --> 02:20:05,180
you were still attempting them though.

3255
02:20:05,280 --> 02:20:10,280
But I caught them with Ronnie in,
but I had no intention of finishing it.

3256
02:20:10,840 --> 02:20:12,920
Rarely thought about finishing it and 
said,

3257
02:20:12,980 --> 02:20:14,660
no,
that's not what I want to do.

3258
02:20:14,840 --> 02:20:17,270
I tried,
I tried six different times.

3259
02:20:17,271 --> 02:20:18,170
I didn't let it go.
He,

3260
02:20:18,240 --> 02:20:20,300
he like,
pushed out of it really hard.

3261
02:20:20,720 --> 02:20:21,740
Um,
I,

3262
02:20:21,741 --> 02:20:23,120
um,
what was I gonna say?

3263
02:20:23,140 --> 02:20:23,420
Uh,
uh,

3264
02:20:23,440 --> 02:20:26,300
multiple times I tried to set up an arm 
triangle from,

3265
02:20:26,700 --> 02:20:28,610
we'd call it,
like a scoop Scorpion,

3266
02:20:28,611 --> 02:20:29,750
but it's a,
what's it called?

3267
02:20:30,130 --> 02:20:30,790
Lockdown.
Right.

3268
02:20:31,050 --> 02:20:33,860
So from the lockdown position,
trying to pass his arm across and set up

3269
02:20:33,861 --> 02:20:35,500
arm triangle triangles.
Because I had been wondering the bottom,

3270
02:20:36,260 --> 02:20:37,100
bottom and top.
Yeah,

3271
02:20:37,670 --> 02:20:39,110
that's what I'd been practicing and 
training.

3272
02:20:39,320 --> 02:20:41,000
That's how I wanted to submit them,
but it wasn't working out,

3273
02:20:41,001 --> 02:20:43,010
but I'd also been practicing some 
triangle setups.

3274
02:20:43,270 --> 02:20:44,300
Uh,
so,

3275
02:20:44,320 --> 02:20:46,250
you know,
that's those two ways work.

3276
02:20:46,250 --> 02:20:47,780
I was kind of going back and forth 
between that,

3277
02:20:47,870 --> 02:20:52,870
trying to submit them.
When you set up the iron arm triangle 

3278
02:20:52,870 --> 02:20:55,061
from the bottom,
do you try to finish it from the bottom 

3279
02:20:55,061 --> 02:20:55,061
or do you sweet?
Uh,

3280
02:20:55,061 --> 02:20:55,061
I think,
I think I,

3281
02:20:55,061 --> 02:20:59,740
my preferred finish,
the absolute best for me is to be 

3282
02:20:59,740 --> 02:21:03,911
slightly to be on bottom,
but to be on my hip as opposed to be 

3283
02:21:03,911 --> 02:21:05,030
facing up towards the sky,
so side onto the person perpendicular.

3284
02:21:05,280 --> 02:21:06,680
Uh,
that's my favorite finish.

3285
02:21:06,890 --> 02:21:07,880
But I,
uh,

3286
02:21:07,881 --> 02:21:12,881
saw aside from that,
finishing it just directly flat facing 

3287
02:21:12,881 --> 02:21:12,881
up I think is worse than finishing it on
top.

3288
02:21:12,881 --> 02:21:14,570
On top is better because you can move 
your hips,

3289
02:21:14,571 --> 02:21:17,210
you can move on and I'll top.
It's always better to get your weight,

3290
02:21:17,570 --> 02:21:22,570
but on the bottom,
the only way it's going to work on the 

3291
02:21:22,570 --> 02:21:24,401
bottom generally if you've got to have 
that locked down in without the 

3292
02:21:24,401 --> 02:21:28,170
lockdown,
because if I have the lockdown and I 

3293
02:21:28,170 --> 02:21:30,041
have the arm trying on the bottom,
I'm just going to stay there and try to 

3294
02:21:30,041 --> 02:21:30,041
finish it from there,
don't you?

3295
02:21:30,041 --> 02:21:32,390
You sometimes go sideways on a guy and 
you have the lock down as well,

3296
02:21:32,391 --> 02:21:37,391
which puts your knee a really funky 
angle talking about the arm chair and 

3297
02:21:37,391 --> 02:21:39,230
going from the bottom,
from stoner control.

3298
02:21:39,231 --> 02:21:41,520
When the lead comes all the way till you
still hold the locked down.

3299
02:21:41,720 --> 02:21:44,810
It's like you go into the vaporizer,
but instead you go for the arm triangle.

3300
02:21:45,120 --> 02:21:45,750
Yeah,
yeah,

3301
02:21:45,950 --> 02:21:46,660
Yep.
No,

3302
02:21:46,670 --> 02:21:48,860
that's a.
that's a precarious position and you get

3303
02:21:48,861 --> 02:21:53,861
a lot of letters from there.
It's hard to set that one up because 

3304
02:21:53,861 --> 02:21:56,741
once you go through the leg,
you still have the lockdown and it's 

3305
02:21:56,741 --> 02:21:57,980
hard to reach.
You got really screwed up there and he's

3306
02:21:57,981 --> 02:22:00,920
got to kind of give it to you.
It's hard to set that one up because you

3307
02:22:00,921 --> 02:22:05,921
set it up if you let go the lockdown to 
pass the guard because you're basically 

3308
02:22:05,921 --> 02:22:06,710
in a lead drag position with the 
lockdown.

3309
02:22:06,950 --> 02:22:11,950
It's the same thing.
You can pass and commit to that arm 

3310
02:22:11,950 --> 02:22:15,341
triangle.
You could keep the lockdown role to a 

3311
02:22:15,341 --> 02:22:17,831
vaporizer or you could get a vaporizer 
by just simply turning and they're just 

3312
02:22:17,831 --> 02:22:20,580
sitting back nice and slow where there's
no role and you go to it.

3313
02:22:20,950 --> 02:22:21,780
You are.
Um,

3314
02:22:21,890 --> 02:22:25,740
your match was interesting because when 
you guys were commentating on that match

3315
02:22:25,741 --> 02:22:29,040
to when you saw he got to that position,
the side trying to set up that triangle,

3316
02:22:29,050 --> 02:22:30,000
you got fired up.
You're like,

3317
02:22:30,001 --> 02:22:31,900
wow.
Yeah.

3318
02:22:31,910 --> 02:22:32,720
You're like,
this is a,

3319
02:22:32,730 --> 02:22:34,650
this is a bad situation.
This is a bad spot.

3320
02:22:34,770 --> 02:22:36,290
I'm,
I know that Gary's,

3321
02:22:36,590 --> 02:22:37,500
he's,
he's,

3322
02:22:37,840 --> 02:22:42,840
uh,
his guillotines or death as far as I'm 

3323
02:22:42,840 --> 02:22:44,880
sure you have way more than I know.
But I know I've seen you.

3324
02:22:44,881 --> 02:22:49,881
I know you got all around Jujitsu game 
and I understand you and you don't want 

3325
02:22:49,881 --> 02:22:52,500
to be known as the lead guy because you 
do have really good,

3326
02:22:52,501 --> 02:22:56,750
like your guillotine is right up there 
with the top guys and your,

3327
02:22:57,300 --> 02:23:01,270
the way you get to the back elite level,
um,

3328
02:23:01,290 --> 02:23:02,370
you got a lot of stuff going on.

3329
02:23:02,400 --> 02:23:06,080
Do you have a very active game from the 
bottom a?

3330
02:23:06,800 --> 02:23:08,290
Was it a shock to me?
I mean,

3331
02:23:08,310 --> 02:23:10,650
you've been training essentially Jujitsu
for about nine years.

3332
02:23:11,320 --> 02:23:13,770
It'll be,
it'll be eight years,

3333
02:23:13,860 --> 02:23:15,000
uh,
the day of his tournament,

3334
02:23:15,001 --> 02:23:16,280
March 20 seconds.
My jujitsu manner.

3335
02:23:16,290 --> 02:23:21,290
That's amazing.
You've been able to have so much 

3336
02:23:21,290 --> 02:23:21,290
progress in such a short time.
That's incredible.

3337
02:23:21,340 --> 02:23:26,340
You must really love it.
You must be just fucking obsessed with 

3338
02:23:26,340 --> 02:23:26,340
since day one.
For sure.

3339
02:23:26,340 --> 02:23:27,630
I was just on the mat as much as 
possible.

3340
02:23:27,730 --> 02:23:32,730
I never really took any breaks.
I'm just constantly training and 

3341
02:23:32,730 --> 02:23:36,921
competing as much as I possibly could.
Do you remember what dragged you into 

3342
02:23:36,921 --> 02:23:36,921
it?
Like what got you so excited about it?

3343
02:23:37,230 --> 02:23:38,030
So,
uh,

3344
02:23:38,040 --> 02:23:39,840
at first the,
just like the sport,

3345
02:23:39,960 --> 02:23:43,980
I didn't know it existed until I was 14 
and my buddy was like,

3346
02:23:43,981 --> 02:23:44,400
hey,
yeah,

3347
02:23:44,401 --> 02:23:49,401
I do this thing,
it's kind of like wrestling where you 

3348
02:23:49,401 --> 02:23:49,401
get to strangle people.

3349
02:23:49,401 --> 02:23:49,401
And I was like,
data here,

3350
02:23:49,401 --> 02:23:50,370
that's bullshit.
Nobody lets that happen.

3351
02:23:50,550 --> 02:23:51,510
And I was like,
you're a kid.

3352
02:23:51,511 --> 02:23:53,670
Like nobody likes to kids try and 
strangle each other.

3353
02:23:53,671 --> 02:23:55,140
That's,
you didn't know me that UFC.

3354
02:23:55,470 --> 02:23:55,950
Uh,
no,

3355
02:23:55,951 --> 02:23:57,120
not at that time.
Wow,

3356
02:23:57,121 --> 02:23:58,140
that's great.
No idea.

3357
02:23:58,260 --> 02:24:01,870
So this is like four or five.
I was living with a,

3358
02:24:01,890 --> 02:24:03,790
I was living with my mom.
She was a single parent that,

3359
02:24:04,020 --> 02:24:09,020
you know,
I mean not that she would have 

3360
02:24:09,020 --> 02:24:09,020
disapproved of that or anything like 
that,

3361
02:24:09,020 --> 02:24:09,020
but it's not like it would have been 
something I would've been,

3362
02:24:09,020 --> 02:24:10,590
you know,
brought interest to,

3363
02:24:10,591 --> 02:24:15,591
you know,
they didn't talk about it at school or 

3364
02:24:15,591 --> 02:24:15,591
anything.
Maybe you heard about it,

3365
02:24:15,591 --> 02:24:15,591
but then look into it.
Yeah.

3366
02:24:15,591 --> 02:24:16,050
No,
it wasn't,

3367
02:24:16,090 --> 02:24:17,940
it wasn't a big part of the culture that
I was in.

3368
02:24:17,941 --> 02:24:19,050
You know what I mean?
So I did,

3369
02:24:19,080 --> 02:24:19,310
yeah.

3370
02:24:19,320 --> 02:24:24,320
It just never.
Nobody ever really brought it up and 

3371
02:24:24,320 --> 02:24:24,320
tell my one friend that happened to be 
training Jujitsu.

3372
02:24:24,320 --> 02:24:26,130
Once I learned about that,
that's when I started learning about UFC

3373
02:24:26,131 --> 02:24:27,030
and stuff like that,
you know,

3374
02:24:27,031 --> 02:24:31,290
I hadn't really experienced any of that.
So that's what got me into the sport,

3375
02:24:31,291 --> 02:24:32,970
but not like obsessed with it.
I was like,

3376
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:33,690
I was like,
wow,

3377
02:24:33,691 --> 02:24:35,430
that sounds really cool.
Went to a competition.

3378
02:24:35,470 --> 02:24:37,200
I was like,
that's the coolest fucking thing ever.

3379
02:24:37,260 --> 02:24:39,360
My mom was not about it.
She was like,

3380
02:24:39,450 --> 02:24:40,980
yeah,
that's not okay.

3381
02:24:40,981 --> 02:24:44,160
You can't do that.
But eventually I convinced her and then,

3382
02:24:44,161 --> 02:24:49,161
uh,
what really kept pushing me forward was 

3383
02:24:49,161 --> 02:24:50,290
the one turning point moment where,
uh,

3384
02:24:50,440 --> 02:24:54,900
I was training with Tom to blast my 
instructor and I actually,

3385
02:24:54,901 --> 02:24:57,290
I was training with somebody else first 
and I,

3386
02:24:57,291 --> 02:25:02,291
they,
I was trying to escape a triangle and 

3387
02:25:02,291 --> 02:25:04,790
Tom comes over to help me,
like to try and help me get out of the 

3388
02:25:04,790 --> 02:25:04,790
triangle.

3389
02:25:04,790 --> 02:25:06,150
I wasn't doing it properly and I was 
like he,

3390
02:25:06,200 --> 02:25:09,980
he gave me advice and then I go oh yeah,
but I usually do this like,

3391
02:25:10,190 --> 02:25:13,430
like in a very standoffish,
like talking back sort of a way like a,

3392
02:25:13,570 --> 02:25:15,420
like a child would,
you know what I mean?

3393
02:25:15,421 --> 02:25:17,250
So I talked back to him and it was 
really bad,

3394
02:25:17,251 --> 02:25:18,360
like disrespectful,
you know,

3395
02:25:18,570 --> 02:25:20,670
in whatever way I said it.
So Tom Goes,

3396
02:25:20,671 --> 02:25:25,671
oh okay let's train you now let's see 
how well you get out of the triangle 

3397
02:25:25,671 --> 02:25:25,671
then lets,
lets go.

3398
02:25:25,671 --> 02:25:28,480
So he's trained with me for a grand 
total of about 35 minutes.

3399
02:25:28,481 --> 02:25:33,481
I would say every two to five minutes 
after he would submit me multiple times 

3400
02:25:33,820 --> 02:25:35,380
he would say,
do you want to stop?

3401
02:25:35,770 --> 02:25:39,440
And every time I was like no because I 
didn't think my beating was done.

3402
02:25:39,460 --> 02:25:41,740
Like I thought I deserved to get the 
shit kicked out of me.

3403
02:25:41,940 --> 02:25:44,080
So I didn't stop.
You had said something?

3404
02:25:44,140 --> 02:25:49,140
Yeah I knew,
I knew right from the get go I fucked 

3405
02:25:49,140 --> 02:25:49,140
up.
Right.

3406
02:25:49,140 --> 02:25:50,920
So he starts training to me.
I get at the end of the match leads to a

3407
02:25:50,921 --> 02:25:55,921
start,
like a sternum bruise the size of 

3408
02:25:55,921 --> 02:25:57,550
Ironmans fucking circle on his chest,
like d burn,

3409
02:25:57,580 --> 02:26:01,240
blood bloody cuts all over my face from 
fucking Eastbourne.

3410
02:26:01,540 --> 02:26:02,860
And like,
literally it was,

3411
02:26:02,890 --> 02:26:07,890
it was definitely child abuse,
like should could have been arrested if 

3412
02:26:07,890 --> 02:26:07,890
I like complained,
you know,

3413
02:26:07,890 --> 02:26:07,890
but I would never,
you know,

3414
02:26:07,890 --> 02:26:09,700
because I deserved it and it made me 
stronger person.

3415
02:26:09,701 --> 02:26:12,730
But after that it was like that,
uh,

3416
02:26:13,210 --> 02:26:15,710
that,
that pie may experience where,

3417
02:26:15,711 --> 02:26:16,960
you know,
in kill bill volume two,

3418
02:26:16,961 --> 02:26:18,270
she's like a,
you know,

3419
02:26:18,430 --> 02:26:23,430
beatrice is getting the shit kicked out 
of her by May and she was like being 

3420
02:26:23,430 --> 02:26:23,470
held down by the arm,
like,

3421
02:26:23,650 --> 02:26:24,940
do you want this power,
you know,

3422
02:26:24,941 --> 02:26:25,630
that sort of thing.

3423
02:26:25,930 --> 02:26:27,040
And uh,
you know,

3424
02:26:27,041 --> 02:26:28,930
I wanted that power to be able to 
fucking,

3425
02:26:29,060 --> 02:26:34,060
you know,
have control over my feet and have 

3426
02:26:34,060 --> 02:26:34,060
control over,
you know,

3427
02:26:34,060 --> 02:26:34,470
being able to defend myself against 
another person,

3428
02:26:34,490 --> 02:26:35,810
be able to,
um,

3429
02:26:35,860 --> 02:26:36,880
you know,
act in that way.

3430
02:26:36,881 --> 02:26:39,730
And then from that point on when I was 
in love with Jujitsu or eventually,

3431
02:26:39,890 --> 02:26:44,890
you know,
in love with competing and wanting to 

3432
02:26:44,890 --> 02:26:45,910
teach and all that stuff.
So is that what you're white belts?

3433
02:26:46,390 --> 02:26:47,110
No,
no,

3434
02:26:47,111 --> 02:26:48,370
I don't.
I do a,

3435
02:26:48,400 --> 02:26:49,930
I probably should though,
if I wanted more.

3436
02:26:50,200 --> 02:26:55,200
Actually I do do that to my,
to my student that I'm trying to bring 

3437
02:26:55,200 --> 02:26:55,200
up,
Gordon Ryan.

3438
02:26:55,200 --> 02:26:59,490
I'd beat the crap out of them as much as
possible and try to demean him and make 

3439
02:26:59,490 --> 02:27:01,180
him whoa.
Just feel horrible to them on the DL.

3440
02:27:01,510 --> 02:27:03,010
You know what big brother?
Um,

3441
02:27:03,090 --> 02:27:05,110
takeaway one day,
like Henzel says that,

3442
02:27:05,111 --> 02:27:06,700
you know,
even his brothers,

3443
02:27:06,701 --> 02:27:07,930
they were younger than him that are 
better than him.

3444
02:27:07,931 --> 02:27:09,310
And it's like I'm always there.
Big Brother.

3445
02:27:09,610 --> 02:27:10,370
Yeah,
yeah,

3446
02:27:10,710 --> 02:27:11,620
yeah.
I try,

3447
02:27:11,621 --> 02:27:16,621
I try my best.
I think that's how you make people good 

3448
02:27:16,621 --> 02:27:16,621
man.
There's something to that for sure.

3449
02:27:16,621 --> 02:27:20,821
But there's also something to just like 
being really lucky and having a great 

3450
02:27:20,821 --> 02:27:20,821
instructor.
Yeah.

3451
02:27:20,821 --> 02:27:24,750
You know,
when a kid hasn't instructed like you 

3452
02:27:24,750 --> 02:27:26,611
that's so passionate about the game,
like one of the hardest parts about 

3453
02:27:26,611 --> 02:27:27,370
Jujitsu and the day was finding real 
good instructor.

3454
02:27:27,470 --> 02:27:28,990
You know,
Eddie and I got super lucky.

3455
02:27:28,991 --> 02:27:30,980
We found John Jacques Machado.
No,

3456
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:33,120
but if you didn't find him,
if you were in like,

3457
02:27:33,350 --> 02:27:35,080
you know,
the middle of nowhere,

3458
02:27:35,081 --> 02:27:38,050
South Dakota and there's no good 
instruction.

3459
02:27:38,060 --> 02:27:43,060
It's hard.
It's hard to find like a really good 

3460
02:27:43,060 --> 02:27:45,001
instructor at such a big deal to have 
like a good camp when you have like a 

3461
02:27:45,001 --> 02:27:49,201
10th planet,
Jiu Jitsu or Benzos Academy or art of 

3462
02:27:49,201 --> 02:27:51,931
Jujitsu,
like these big Jujitsu places where all 

3463
02:27:51,931 --> 02:27:53,240
these killers come from such a giant 
advantage.

3464
02:27:53,270 --> 02:27:58,270
So it's so huge.
We're so lucky here in southern 

3465
02:27:58,270 --> 02:27:58,270
California.
I mean,

3466
02:27:58,270 --> 02:28:01,981
what,
what's better as far as locations on 

3467
02:28:01,981 --> 02:28:04,591
earth than the Brazilians,
like the beach and Miami.

3468
02:28:06,280 --> 02:28:07,180
But Miami.
Yeah.

3469
02:28:07,181 --> 02:28:09,010
When you find like the ones that are 
like,

3470
02:28:09,011 --> 02:28:10,810
fuck man,
I'm going to go to Toronto.

3471
02:28:10,811 --> 02:28:13,680
There's a lot of trying.

3472
02:28:14,410 --> 02:28:17,380
Sallow went to Ohio for a little bit and
I remember thinking,

3473
02:28:17,381 --> 02:28:20,290
man,
have Brazilian in Ohio.

3474
02:28:20,430 --> 02:28:21,320
How long was that going

3475
02:28:22,570 --> 02:28:23,750
to jail?
They wrote,

3476
02:28:23,751 --> 02:28:26,400
this project has been up there for a,
an American Brazilian.

3477
02:28:26,900 --> 02:28:27,410
He's uh,
he's,

3478
02:28:27,480 --> 02:28:28,640
he's white.
Well,

3479
02:28:28,641 --> 02:28:32,750
how about a fucking Gabriel Gonzaga.
He's in western Massachusetts.

3480
02:28:32,751 --> 02:28:34,310
Man.
He's in the middle of nowhere.

3481
02:28:34,311 --> 02:28:36,920
It's in Ludlow,
I think with the name of the place.

3482
02:28:36,950 --> 02:28:39,020
He see these places make people 
stronger.

3483
02:28:40,100 --> 02:28:42,890
You guys in California don't know.
Pain and suffering.

3484
02:28:42,891 --> 02:28:44,840
You guys get to live in this nice 
weather all the time.

3485
02:28:44,841 --> 02:28:49,430
To go from Rio to that part of western 
Massachusetts where Gonzaga lives.

3486
02:28:51,260 --> 02:28:54,780
Fuck you went from like one of the most 
beautiful spots on earth to a place for,

3487
02:28:54,790 --> 02:28:56,270
for six months.
It's sucks.

3488
02:28:56,271 --> 02:29:01,271
A fat plated digs.
What else do you have to do besides 

3489
02:29:01,271 --> 02:29:01,271
train?
Man,

3490
02:29:01,271 --> 02:29:02,630
there's so much other things to do here.
What's that?

3491
02:29:02,631 --> 02:29:04,150
Have you been in Brazil?
Uh,

3492
02:29:04,190 --> 02:29:04,970
no.
Not yet.

3493
02:29:05,030 --> 02:29:06,740
I'm looking forward to it for this next 
day.

3494
02:29:06,830 --> 02:29:08,570
80 eight.
Oh Shit.

3495
02:29:08,630 --> 02:29:11,510
I mean they haven't put out official 
official invites that Saul.

3496
02:29:11,511 --> 02:29:12,110
Paulo,

3497
02:29:12,140 --> 02:29:15,800
Hopefully you're in 100 percent.
We'll see cios and he qualified.

3498
02:29:16,050 --> 02:29:18,320
So I'll be there for sure.
It's going to be in Sao Paolo,

3499
02:29:18,380 --> 02:29:21,650
August 28th and August 29th.

Come out with that.
Let me see if I can.

3504
02:29:29,541 --> 02:29:31,370
I don't know what my,
my shit.

3505
02:29:31,430 --> 02:29:33,830
Swole,
my friend Michael gets half a Mendez.

3506
02:29:33,890 --> 02:29:38,890
It might be held against Alpha.
You never know what's going to happen 

3507
02:29:38,890 --> 02:29:39,000
that stands out.
I just,

3508
02:29:39,530 --> 02:29:44,530
there's so many good guys these days.
It's really seriously is on another 

3509
02:29:44,530 --> 02:29:46,190
level,
man is on another level.

3510
02:29:46,191 --> 02:29:48,470
You were saying that a lot.
He is breakdancing.

3511
02:29:48,530 --> 02:29:53,530
Strength from the percent.
Yesterday I did an inside Bjj podcasts 

3512
02:29:53,780 --> 02:29:58,120
and they asked me what is the single 
most important attribute to Jiu Jitsu if

3513
02:29:58,130 --> 02:29:59,480
you only have one attribute.

3514
02:29:59,930 --> 02:30:04,470
And uh,
my answer was initially was a,

3515
02:30:04,610 --> 02:30:07,790
I would like to say openmindedness true 
open mindedness,

3516
02:30:07,791 --> 02:30:12,791
but there's a lot of close minded guys 
out there that are the best in the 

3517
02:30:12,791 --> 02:30:12,791
world.
So it can't be that.

3518
02:30:12,791 --> 02:30:13,220
That's a good point.
It can't be that.

3519
02:30:13,800 --> 02:30:16,790
I thought about it for two seconds and 
it has to be athleticism,

3520
02:30:17,210 --> 02:30:20,690
athleticism.
You get a guy coming in who's been doing

3521
02:30:20,990 --> 02:30:23,360
gymnastics his whole life and he's high 
level.

3522
02:30:23,690 --> 02:30:26,270
That guy's going to get really good at 
Jujitsu in one month,

3523
02:30:26,450 --> 02:30:29,900
in one month,
and that's Geo and his brother Boogie.

3524
02:30:30,110 --> 02:30:33,110
Both of them just really quick.
Got their black belts.

3525
02:30:33,350 --> 02:30:38,350
They're just,
their athleticism is just off the 

3526
02:30:38,350 --> 02:30:40,301
charts.
They could do the craziest shit with 

3527
02:30:40,301 --> 02:30:40,400
their hands standing on the hand,
spinning around,

3528
02:30:40,401 --> 02:30:42,020
landing their balance.
Their,

3529
02:30:42,021 --> 02:30:47,021
their,
their core strength is off the charts 

3530
02:30:47,021 --> 02:30:49,410
and,
and the crazy thing is geo got so good 

3531
02:30:49,410 --> 02:30:49,410
so quick.

3532
02:30:49,410 --> 02:30:49,500
He got his,
you know,

3533
02:30:49,520 --> 02:30:51,500
he's got his black belt.
Like Sabrina did.

3534
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:53,360
Got His black belt in three and a half 
years.

3535
02:30:53,361 --> 02:30:54,830
He did.
Gopal went on his whole life.

3536
02:30:54,860 --> 02:30:56,960
That's athleticism,
breakdancing,

3537
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:59,580
the kind of break dancing geo does.
That's athleticism.

3538
02:30:59,600 --> 02:31:02,120
That's like super hyper,
super evolve.

3539
02:31:02,170 --> 02:31:03,590
Breakdancing.
It's crazy.

3540
02:31:03,680 --> 02:31:06,170
So it doesn't.
He got so his black belt so quick,

3541
02:31:06,171 --> 02:31:09,650
but it is his rises and stopping.
It's not like okay.

3542
02:31:09,651 --> 02:31:12,770
He caught up and that's it.
That athleticism that got him,

3543
02:31:12,771 --> 02:31:17,771
that black belt so quick is going to 
take them to the next level quicker and 

3544
02:31:17,771 --> 02:31:18,530
those higher levels quicker.
He is getting better.

3545
02:31:18,620 --> 02:31:21,940
All the isn't enough to beat someone 
that can have Amanda's cassava.

3546
02:31:21,960 --> 02:31:24,840
Mendez is unreal.
Unreal.

3547
02:31:25,110 --> 02:31:27,570
Half Amanda's defense.
No one ever does anything to them.

3548
02:31:27,900 --> 02:31:30,270
Anytime he loses it's on some advantage 
or something.

3549
02:31:30,271 --> 02:31:31,800
If he loses.
Other than that,

3550
02:31:32,070 --> 02:31:33,230
you can do anything to him.

3551
02:31:33,510 --> 02:31:37,230
You know,
there's a matches of him or roles within

3552
02:31:37,231 --> 02:31:42,231
what?
Enrico was way bigger than him and he's 

3553
02:31:42,231 --> 02:31:44,421
tapping into a Cuban cornelius.
There's a match online is way bigger 

3554
02:31:44,421 --> 02:31:48,591
than half a half a gallon and I know 
there's other matches where maybe keen 

3555
02:31:48,591 --> 02:31:51,030
and taps him,
but apparently no one's tapping on that.

3556
02:31:51,031 --> 02:31:54,920
Is the top guy in the world at 1:45
in ADCC.

3557
02:31:55,600 --> 02:31:57,360
We'll see if is ready for that.
Maybe.

3558
02:31:57,540 --> 02:31:59,790
Maybe half a smashes.
You don't know.

3559
02:31:59,850 --> 02:32:00,870
Maybe it's too soon.
Right now.

3560
02:32:00,871 --> 02:32:03,810
Maybe it's going to take another three 
or four years to catch them catch up,

3561
02:32:03,900 --> 02:32:07,020
but we're gonna find out and I really 
believe geo is on another level.

3562
02:32:07,021 --> 02:32:08,280
I roll with them all the time,
man,

3563
02:32:08,580 --> 02:32:11,250
and I can't do shit to him no more.
I'm like,

3564
02:32:11,251 --> 02:32:13,470
fuck this guy,
and he's lighter than me.

3565
02:32:13,471 --> 02:32:15,720
I got 20 pounds on.
Yeah,

3566
02:32:15,810 --> 02:32:16,560
it's amazing.

3567
02:32:16,740 --> 02:32:17,940
It's amazing.
It's amazing.

3568
02:32:17,941 --> 02:32:22,941
What we learned too,
that that break dancing is a doorway to 

3569
02:32:22,941 --> 02:32:24,090
yes and mastics.
Everybody always knew wrestling.

3570
02:32:24,091 --> 02:32:27,360
Of course,
his first month he was all overdues like

3571
02:32:27,361 --> 02:32:32,361
Holy Shit.
Shawn [inaudible] brought them over to 

3572
02:32:32,361 --> 02:32:32,361
me and said,
dude,

3573
02:32:32,361 --> 02:32:35,450
this guy is on another level and he has 
a break dancing crew called the freak 

3574
02:32:35,450 --> 02:32:37,320
show and all of those guys were doing 
and they all got good.

3575
02:32:37,440 --> 02:32:42,440
All of them really quick,
but Geo and buggy or the only ones that 

3576
02:32:42,440 --> 02:32:45,321
stuck with it,
the other break dancers just went back 

3577
02:32:45,321 --> 02:32:45,330
to breakdancing.
They dabbled in it for like a year and a

3578
02:32:45,330 --> 02:32:47,500
half and got really good.
All of them really good right away.

3579
02:32:47,790 --> 02:32:49,530
Professional Jujitsu in six months we're
like,

3580
02:32:49,531 --> 02:32:54,531
holy fuck.
There's moves that you do in break 

3581
02:32:54,531 --> 02:32:58,531
dancing that require like insane balance
and coordination and strength like Steve

3582
02:33:00,160 --> 02:33:05,160
Maxwell Hmi.
Do these crazy workouts the other day 

3583
02:33:05,160 --> 02:33:06,920
where you're doing like this push up and
then you pick one hand up and then you 

3584
02:33:06,920 --> 02:33:11,820
pick one leg up and then you lift the 
other knee off the ground by two inches 

3585
02:33:11,820 --> 02:33:16,281
and you're holding it there,
so one legs forward using like a 

3586
02:33:16,281 --> 02:33:16,281
superman position,
right?

3587
02:33:16,281 --> 02:33:16,920
You're in what you're holding yourself 
up with,

3588
02:33:16,921 --> 02:33:21,921
one hand and one foot on the other side 
and your knee is off the ground and the 

3589
02:33:21,921 --> 02:33:24,060
leg is up and the hand is up and you're 
just holding it.

3590
02:33:24,090 --> 02:33:29,090
It's insanely difficult.
Now you gotta show me after I'll show 

3591
02:33:29,090 --> 02:33:30,030
you afterwards.
It's insanely difficult,

3592
02:33:30,060 --> 02:33:31,890
but then you think about what these guys
are doing.

3593
02:33:32,040 --> 02:33:37,040
They're standing on one hand,
they're spinning around with their legs 

3594
02:33:37,040 --> 02:33:40,311
up in the air.
It's not that old school standard basic 

3595
02:33:40,311 --> 02:33:43,431
breakdancing that you saw and it's got 
their style is they do crazy weird 

3596
02:33:45,511 --> 02:33:50,511
things.
They're always evolving and new moves 

3597
02:33:50,511 --> 02:33:50,670
and new and that translates to Jujitsu 
to me.

3598
02:33:50,671 --> 02:33:53,100
Better than wrestling,
better than gymnastics.

3599
02:33:53,101 --> 02:33:57,420
I've never seen it from day one.
I seen them come up and his.

3600
02:33:57,840 --> 02:34:00,270
What he's doing is he's just getting 
started.

3601
02:34:00,271 --> 02:34:05,271
This is just the beginning of Geo Gary.
Tone and break dancing moves your 

3602
02:34:06,721 --> 02:34:08,700
cardboard with you.
You laid that shit out.

3603
02:34:08,701 --> 02:34:13,260
You started planning system is off the 
charts too.

3604
02:34:13,261 --> 02:34:15,650
He's doing back flips like it's nothing,
right?

3605
02:34:15,660 --> 02:34:18,300
You can do a lot of crazy.
He's doing fly

3606
02:34:18,310 --> 02:34:21,440
enroll in Camorra's.
He's doing that fly and uh,

3607
02:34:21,730 --> 02:34:22,930
what do you call it?
Sisera take.

3608
02:34:23,050 --> 02:34:24,660
He's doing all.
So he's very arrogant.

3609
02:34:24,880 --> 02:34:26,950
So his athleticism is off the charts as 
well.

3610
02:34:27,010 --> 02:34:28,970
What's your ultimate goal?
What do you,

3611
02:34:28,971 --> 02:34:33,971
if you,
do you have goals that you've set for 

3612
02:34:33,971 --> 02:34:33,971
yourself as far as your competition 
career which you want to achieve?

3613
02:34:34,150 --> 02:34:39,150
Yeah,
I think the main goal right now is to 

3614
02:34:39,150 --> 02:34:41,460
bring submission,
grappling to that level we're talking 

3615
02:34:41,460 --> 02:34:41,460
about to where it's,
you know,

3616
02:34:41,460 --> 02:34:43,010
it's an exciting spectator sport that,
you know,

3617
02:34:43,150 --> 02:34:45,310
people can get paid to do and it's like 
a career,

3618
02:34:45,670 --> 02:34:46,380
you know?
Um,

3619
02:34:46,420 --> 02:34:47,080
that's,
you know,

3620
02:34:47,320 --> 02:34:48,130
obviously,
you know,

3621
02:34:48,160 --> 02:34:51,550
personally that's kind of my goal,
but it's kind of a goal for the sport at

3622
02:34:51,551 --> 02:34:52,330
the same,
same.

3623
02:34:52,490 --> 02:34:54,050
It's just perfect timing.
Ladies.

3624
02:34:54,051 --> 02:34:55,600
He sees obviously a big goal,
you know,

3625
02:34:55,601 --> 02:34:57,520
it's coming up,
you're hotter than ever.

3626
02:34:57,670 --> 02:35:02,670
You're the shining star of Metamorris 
Ebi welterweight champion and we're 

3627
02:35:03,461 --> 02:35:08,461
doing the welterweight championship.
It's like everything just aligned 

3628
02:35:08,461 --> 02:35:08,461
perfectly,
man.

3629
02:35:08,461 --> 02:35:08,461
I'm like,
fuck,

3630
02:35:08,461 --> 02:35:13,291
I'm,
I'm lucky that I listened to Scotty 

3631
02:35:13,291 --> 02:35:13,540
Nelson and brought Gary Toner and I'm 
lucky man.

3632
02:35:13,541 --> 02:35:15,220
I really want to be a part of it,
man.

3633
02:35:15,221 --> 02:35:17,290
I did.
I appreciate this tremendously,

3634
02:35:17,291 --> 02:35:22,291
man.
I have to ask you about this because 

3635
02:35:22,291 --> 02:35:22,291
people keep bringing it up.
I hear you have a terrible diet.

3636
02:35:22,291 --> 02:35:23,140
Oh yeah.
Is that true?

3637
02:35:23,350 --> 02:35:25,960
Yeah.
A vegans everywhere hate me.

3638
02:35:26,070 --> 02:35:27,790
Um,
I don't know what it is,

3639
02:35:27,820 --> 02:35:32,720
but we'll see.
I took so metamorris the guys that video

3640
02:35:32,790 --> 02:35:35,590
tape,
like the pre fight whatever bs,

3641
02:35:35,591 --> 02:35:37,270
right?
So they're like,

3642
02:35:37,300 --> 02:35:42,300
okay,
watch a couple of videos that we did in 

3643
02:35:42,300 --> 02:35:44,371
the past and it's like Braulio and 
Adolfo and both of them are talking 

3644
02:35:44,371 --> 02:35:44,371
about their diet.
Like,

3645
02:35:44,500 --> 02:35:49,500
oh yeah,
I just eat like a little bit of grass 

3646
02:35:49,500 --> 02:35:52,000
and like some leaves become big and 
strong and it's like,

3647
02:35:52,001 --> 02:35:53,380
come on man,
are you serious?

3648
02:35:53,430 --> 02:35:56,710
Adolfo just eats like Chia seeds all 
day.

3649
02:35:57,220 --> 02:35:58,600
Come on man,
I saw you,

3650
02:35:58,710 --> 02:35:59,560
you know what I mean,
like,

3651
02:35:59,650 --> 02:36:01,060
so anyway,
I was just like,

3652
02:36:01,130 --> 02:36:02,480
all right,
these guys really have this cleaned up,

3653
02:36:02,540 --> 02:36:07,540
let's,
I'll give them the real look at what my 

3654
02:36:07,540 --> 02:36:07,540
diet is really like,
you know,

3655
02:36:07,540 --> 02:36:10,831
and for me because I'm in between 
trainings all the time and stuff like 

3656
02:36:10,831 --> 02:36:13,861
that.
It's just like I eat whatever I can and 

3657
02:36:13,861 --> 02:36:13,861
I need a high dense amount of calories 
all the time.

3658
02:36:13,861 --> 02:36:16,410
So it's like cheeseburgers and pizza and
stuff like that.

3659
02:36:16,420 --> 02:36:17,220
I just,
you know,

3660
02:36:17,260 --> 02:36:21,820
that's my main bulk of my diet now when 
I wake cut I know how to eat healthy,

3661
02:36:21,880 --> 02:36:26,880
you know,
like when I weight cut I do the right 

3662
02:36:26,880 --> 02:36:26,880
things,
you know,

3663
02:36:26,880 --> 02:36:29,620
eat a lot of fiber.
And do you make sure you get a lot of 

3664
02:36:29,620 --> 02:36:29,620
nutrients though?
Do you take that?

3665
02:36:29,620 --> 02:36:31,510
Definitely take vitamins and things and 
then you know,

3666
02:36:31,511 --> 02:36:32,590
occasionally I'll,
I'll,

3667
02:36:32,620 --> 02:36:34,630
I'll pump in a few vegetables here and 
there.

3668
02:36:34,631 --> 02:36:37,240
But you really don't.
She don't eat many vegetables for real.

3669
02:36:37,300 --> 02:36:37,650
Yeah.
No,

3670
02:36:37,670 --> 02:36:37,960
no,
no,

3671
02:36:37,970 --> 02:36:38,430
no,
no,

3672
02:36:38,540 --> 02:36:39,090
no,
no,

3673
02:36:39,270 --> 02:36:40,640
no,
like real daily basis.

3674
02:36:40,641 --> 02:36:42,610
That's we need a man.
I'm the same one.

3675
02:36:42,940 --> 02:36:47,940
I eat a little salad everyday,
but a little bullshit El Pollo loco 

3676
02:36:47,940 --> 02:36:48,250
salad or something,
you know to.

3677
02:36:48,280 --> 02:36:50,290
I swear to God,
if you just give it a shot,

3678
02:36:50,320 --> 02:36:52,450
just try drinking Kale shakes in the 
morning.

3679
02:36:52,700 --> 02:36:55,150
Have a Kale shake instead of what you 
normally have for breakfast.

3680
02:36:55,151 --> 02:36:57,640
It tastes like dog shit.
Tastes like it.

3681
02:36:57,641 --> 02:37:00,570
Tastes like and that's all you pre-cum 
will that.

3682
02:37:00,760 --> 02:37:02,300
Will that cover my vegetables for the 
day?

3683
02:37:02,320 --> 02:37:07,320
Yeah,
I would imagine it would cover your 

3684
02:37:07,320 --> 02:37:07,320
vegetables.
Really.

3685
02:37:07,320 --> 02:37:07,320
That seems to be on it.
You,

3686
02:37:07,320 --> 02:37:07,720
you,
you,

3687
02:37:07,740 --> 02:37:10,840
you mix up some garlic.
You mix up some ginger,

3688
02:37:10,841 --> 02:37:12,820
like a hunk of ginger,
like a half a page.

3689
02:37:12,821 --> 02:37:15,920
You remember what a pager was like?
Cut a pager in half that in the blue and

3690
02:37:15,970 --> 02:37:16,270
sounds

3691
02:37:16,270 --> 02:37:17,660
too hard.
Kale.

3692
02:37:17,690 --> 02:37:18,850
Celery.
Exactly.

3693
02:37:18,851 --> 02:37:23,851
That.
There's so much effort that just went 

3694
02:37:23,851 --> 02:37:23,851
into his garden.
The chocolate flavor.

3695
02:37:23,851 --> 02:37:25,370
Is that good enough?
I mean you look,

3696
02:37:25,371 --> 02:37:30,371
all those things are good.
Like either there's earth grown 

3697
02:37:30,371 --> 02:37:30,420
nutrients at on and has garden of life.
Has a bunch of drinks.

3698
02:37:30,421 --> 02:37:32,690
They bridget.
Very legit.

3699
02:37:32,691 --> 02:37:33,770
Okay.
Good stuff.

3700
02:37:33,920 --> 02:37:35,690
It's definitely better than not having 
it,

3701
02:37:35,691 --> 02:37:38,210
but the best shit you can get is fresh 
vegetables.

3702
02:37:38,360 --> 02:37:41,090
That's the best shit.
Fresh vegetables with garlic.

3703
02:37:41,150 --> 02:37:45,590
Some fruit,
like a maybe like a pineapple or apple,

3704
02:37:45,650 --> 02:37:47,210
some coconut oil,
mixed.

3705
02:37:47,211 --> 02:37:50,090
All that shit up together in a blend.
Things kicking everyone's ass,

3706
02:37:50,510 --> 02:37:53,650
kicking everyone's ass going to be fine.
You're.

3707
02:37:54,290 --> 02:37:56,060
I'm not saying,
I'm not saying that like,

3708
02:37:56,130 --> 02:38:01,130
you know that you know,
me eating shitty is leading to me 

3709
02:38:01,130 --> 02:38:04,031
winning or vice versa.
I definitely think that for longterm 

3710
02:38:04,031 --> 02:38:04,031
health,
like you know,

3711
02:38:04,031 --> 02:38:04,031
I,
I mean I studied,

3712
02:38:04,031 --> 02:38:05,990
I studied exercise science,
I have a degree in exercise science,

3713
02:38:06,400 --> 02:38:11,400
you know,
we had nutrition classes and everything 

3714
02:38:11,400 --> 02:38:11,400
like that and it's clearly you know,
for,

3715
02:38:11,400 --> 02:38:14,540
for your longterm health,
like eating well is like the right thing

3716
02:38:14,541 --> 02:38:17,210
to do just as much as exercising is the 
right thing to do.

3717
02:38:17,210 --> 02:38:22,210
But in terms of just my ability to do so
on a day to day basis with my training 

3718
02:38:22,491 --> 02:38:24,170
schedule and with everything else is 
just very,

3719
02:38:24,171 --> 02:38:25,460
very difficult.
Don't make sense,

3720
02:38:25,490 --> 02:38:28,190
but I don't take as much stock into it 
as some people believe like,

3721
02:38:28,460 --> 02:38:33,460
oh,
this is going to be that deciding 

3722
02:38:33,460 --> 02:38:35,591
factor,
that point one percent that's going to 

3723
02:38:35,591 --> 02:38:36,290
make you beat So-and-so.
I don't truly believe that,

3724
02:38:36,320 --> 02:38:36,940
you know?
Um,

3725
02:38:37,160 --> 02:38:42,160
because uh,
I mean ultimately if I lose because my 

3726
02:38:42,160 --> 02:38:44,510
diet wasn't good that day or whatever 
the case may be,

3727
02:38:44,511 --> 02:38:47,150
I really just don't feel like I was that
good at Jujitsu to begin with.

3728
02:38:47,270 --> 02:38:52,270
Like,
I should be making improvements in 

3729
02:38:52,270 --> 02:38:52,270
Jujitsu.
Not,

3730
02:38:52,270 --> 02:38:52,270
you know,
not that I know.

3731
02:38:52,270 --> 02:38:53,000
Like I said,
it's important,

3732
02:38:53,001 --> 02:38:54,140
but not for.
Not for.

3733
02:38:54,180 --> 02:38:56,540
It's not going to be the deciding factor
between me beating somebody.

3734
02:38:56,541 --> 02:38:58,040
You're not beating.
That makes sense.

3735
02:38:58,040 --> 02:39:00,170
That's just silly.
That makes sense in some ways,

3736
02:39:00,171 --> 02:39:05,171
but in some ways it doesn't because if 
you think about like you don't have the 

3737
02:39:05,171 --> 02:39:06,410
ultimate optimal conditioning,
right?

3738
02:39:06,411 --> 02:39:08,900
You don't have the ultimate.
There's always room for improvement,

3739
02:39:08,901 --> 02:39:13,901
right?
There's always room for improvement in 

3740
02:39:13,901 --> 02:39:15,261
your coordination.
There's always room for improvement in 

3741
02:39:15,261 --> 02:39:15,261
your technique.
All those things.

3742
02:39:15,261 --> 02:39:16,280
There was room for improvement.
How could it not be room for improvement

3743
02:39:16,281 --> 02:39:18,380
in your new tissue?
Nutritional technique?

3744
02:39:18,460 --> 02:39:19,760
I what?
What technique?

3745
02:39:19,761 --> 02:39:24,761
Like how do you fuel your body?
Certainly is what do you use rooms or 

3746
02:39:24,761 --> 02:39:27,281
improvement in mind,
but don't you think there's like a 

3747
02:39:27,281 --> 02:39:28,090
technique to giving yourself the right 
amount of carbohydrates,

3748
02:39:28,170 --> 02:39:30,410
certain amount of protein,
a certain time.

3749
02:39:30,470 --> 02:39:35,470
It's a couple of things.
He's young and his body is crazy 

3750
02:39:35,470 --> 02:39:39,050
metabolism and he's not being put in 
positions where he's.

3751
02:39:39,160 --> 02:39:44,160
He's getting dragged out into deep,
deep waters and he's getting tired and 

3752
02:39:44,160 --> 02:39:44,160
now it's the end.

3753
02:39:44,160 --> 02:39:48,410
It's like a 20 minute match minute 17 
and he's going against Marcello Garcia.

3754
02:39:48,560 --> 02:39:51,320
Then maybe that's where the Diet is 
going to come into play,

3755
02:39:51,710 --> 02:39:56,710
but right now he's blowing through 
everybody so it doesn't matter if he'd 

3756
02:39:56,710 --> 02:39:56,720
dig downs,
but that's what I'm saying.

3757
02:39:56,721 --> 02:40:01,721
Like it doesn't kind of make sense.
Saying that a guy beats you wouldn't 

3758
02:40:01,721 --> 02:40:01,721
have beaten you because you 
nutritionally.

3759
02:40:01,820 --> 02:40:03,440
I think for the most part.
Sorry,

3760
02:40:03,441 --> 02:40:03,920
go ahead.
No,

3761
02:40:03,921 --> 02:40:04,510
I was going to say,
look,

3762
02:40:04,520 --> 02:40:06,350
the chrome gracie fight like the end of 
the fight.

3763
02:40:06,950 --> 02:40:11,950
Was it just his superior technique or 
was it a combination of being exhausted 

3764
02:40:11,950 --> 02:40:15,780
and meet massive expenditure energy from
both parties and I was just in a really,

3765
02:40:15,781 --> 02:40:16,920
really bad spot.
I mean,

3766
02:40:16,921 --> 02:40:18,870
the guy had my back with like a body 
triangle.

3767
02:40:18,871 --> 02:40:22,470
I stood up trying to last ditch efforts 
to trying to defend the choke.

3768
02:40:22,471 --> 02:40:23,670
It had nothing to do with.

3769
02:40:24,210 --> 02:40:26,850
It had nothing to do with my 
conditioning or anything like that.

3770
02:40:26,910 --> 02:40:29,130
Was I tired at that point?
I can't even remember,

3771
02:40:29,131 --> 02:40:34,131
but I don't think I was tired.
I think I was just in a really shitty 

3772
02:40:34,131 --> 02:40:37,311
spot and that's why I ended up tapping 
out because I thought I was about to go 

3773
02:40:37,311 --> 02:40:40,851
unconscious.
I'm not because I was tired or 

3774
02:40:40,851 --> 02:40:40,851
exhausted.
I don't think I would have.

3775
02:40:40,851 --> 02:40:44,930
I think if you put me in the same 
situation at a complete 100 percent 

3776
02:40:44,930 --> 02:40:48,171
right before the match,
I wouldn't have gotten out any better 

3777
02:40:48,171 --> 02:40:48,171
than I did.
They're really.

3778
02:40:48,171 --> 02:40:48,171
Um,
but uh,

3779
02:40:48,171 --> 02:40:48,520
yeah man,
I,

3780
02:40:48,521 --> 02:40:49,860
I mean,
I agree it makes a difference,

3781
02:40:49,861 --> 02:40:54,861
but not.
I don't think that enough for you to 

3782
02:40:54,861 --> 02:40:54,861
stop it from pizza and not,
not too good.

3783
02:40:55,960 --> 02:40:56,820
Fired,
I'm like,

3784
02:40:56,821 --> 02:41:01,140
I felt better about myself if I had my 
tons of money and like the ability to do

3785
02:41:01,141 --> 02:41:01,830
that,
you know,

3786
02:41:01,831 --> 02:41:06,831
like Oh,
I've got to hire somebody to follow me 

3787
02:41:06,831 --> 02:41:06,831
around and feed me good shit all the 
time.

3788
02:41:06,831 --> 02:41:06,831
One hundred percent.
I would.

3789
02:41:06,831 --> 02:41:11,640
You wouldn't want that anyway.
That guy would be annoying to have to 

3790
02:41:11,640 --> 02:41:11,640
fly.
Right.

3791
02:41:12,320 --> 02:41:13,950
Telling me to get the fuck away from the
pizza.

3792
02:41:14,530 --> 02:41:16,620
Know for sure.
Hey Man,

3793
02:41:16,621 --> 02:41:19,130
get away from that pizza bro.
You good bro.

3794
02:41:19,140 --> 02:41:24,140
We're going to keep our old poem.
I think the human body is an amazing 

3795
02:41:24,871 --> 02:41:29,871
thing to be honest.
And I think that it takes pretty much 

3796
02:41:29,871 --> 02:41:31,140
whatever the fuck you put inside of it 
and turns it into what it needs.

3797
02:41:31,141 --> 02:41:36,141
So you know,
who was notorious for eating a 

3798
02:41:36,141 --> 02:41:36,141
cheeseburger before every fucking games.
Michael Jordan.

3799
02:41:36,141 --> 02:41:38,280
That was like his ritual.
He would go to burger king or Mcdonald's

3800
02:41:38,281 --> 02:41:43,281
rather.
And you get a big Mac maybe to anybody 

3801
02:41:43,281 --> 02:41:43,450
eat them before every Michael Jordan.
Michael motherfucking.

3802
02:41:44,800 --> 02:41:49,800
What'd you say?
You're talking about people we're 

3803
02:41:49,800 --> 02:41:49,800
talking to bang,
boom,

3804
02:41:49,800 --> 02:41:50,400
potatoes,
steak and potatoes.

3805
02:41:50,401 --> 02:41:51,390
What?
That's what he eat everyday.

3806
02:41:51,530 --> 02:41:54,760
Yeah.
But he ate cheeseburgers before for dsps

3807
02:41:54,780 --> 02:41:55,350
like that.
To.

3808
02:41:55,590 --> 02:41:57,620
Hold on a second.
I'm going to agree with this shit.

3809
02:41:57,880 --> 02:41:59,670
I was a Jordan Fan.
Says,

3810
02:41:59,680 --> 02:42:02,440
okay,
I'm pregame meal in 2001.

3811
02:42:02,590 --> 02:42:04,370
I've compensated for pride.
Terrible.

3812
02:42:04,371 --> 02:42:09,371
Mark Kerr,
I met him at the airport at Mcdonald's 

3813
02:42:09,371 --> 02:42:12,261
and he was killing McDonald's.
I video taped and everything just to 

3814
02:42:12,261 --> 02:42:12,261
prove that.
Look at this.

3815
02:42:12,261 --> 02:42:15,960
Look at this athlete eating this crap 
because I have to keep proving to people

3816
02:42:15,961 --> 02:42:18,420
that it's Mcdonald's.
Isn't that bad for you?

3817
02:42:19,230 --> 02:42:20,370
Oh,
it's definitely horrible.

3818
02:42:20,850 --> 02:42:22,980
I know it is,
but it tastes so good.

3819
02:42:23,690 --> 02:42:26,070
Is it going to drastically affect my 
athletic performance?

3820
02:42:26,071 --> 02:42:30,300
I was heated 10 seconds beforehand.
Now every Friday my mom would take us to

3821
02:42:30,750 --> 02:42:33,930
Mcdonald's when she got paid on Friday.
So it was like a treat.

3822
02:42:34,050 --> 02:42:36,120
Oh yeah.
Raised as going to Mcdonald's.

3823
02:42:36,180 --> 02:42:38,370
This is what we've been waiting for all 
week.

3824
02:42:39,120 --> 02:42:40,910
So this is so exciting.
Okay.

3825
02:42:40,920 --> 02:42:45,920
I'm incorrect.
Or he ate the same meal before every 

3826
02:42:45,920 --> 02:42:46,020
game of 23 on steak.
A baked potato and a ginger ale.

3827
02:42:46,050 --> 02:42:47,550
That's not bad.
Big Difference.

3828
02:42:47,640 --> 02:42:49,350
That's a big difference.
That's healthy.

3829
02:42:49,620 --> 02:42:50,610
Well,
why did I hear that?

3830
02:42:50,611 --> 02:42:52,230
It was a fucking cheeseburger,
man.

3831
02:42:52,320 --> 02:42:53,790
God Damn it.
Who the hell was that?

3832
02:42:53,791 --> 02:42:55,420
Was that somebody else wants Mcdonald's.
Oh,

3833
02:42:55,450 --> 02:42:58,200
so it was a lie.
Just those things they spread out.

3834
02:42:59,880 --> 02:43:00,750
Oh,
okay.

3835
02:43:00,751 --> 02:43:04,260
So this is.
Is this like things that are just like,

3836
02:43:05,040 --> 02:43:07,840
okay,
he wants punch Steve,

3837
02:43:07,841 --> 02:43:08,580
someone,
Steve,

3838
02:43:08,581 --> 02:43:10,020
Kurt,
and the phase during practice.

3839
02:43:11,350 --> 02:43:12,070
We don't need to see all

3840
02:43:12,070 --> 02:43:14,230
that shit,
but okay.

3841
02:43:14,260 --> 02:43:17,840
So forget what I said.
I'm trying to say is fucking dying.

3842
02:43:17,890 --> 02:43:20,750
Was gonna take that one back already.
Good.

3843
02:43:21,760 --> 02:43:23,440
Some people would take that and say that
is that.

3844
02:43:23,460 --> 02:43:26,250
It's not that good with the grass was a 
grasp.

3845
02:43:26,460 --> 02:43:28,370
It probably not.
Probably not,

3846
02:43:28,440 --> 02:43:30,340
but it's just a slightly higher grade of
beef.

3847
02:43:30,420 --> 02:43:33,430
What do you think Carl's junior burger 
now that the natural burger.

3848
02:43:33,431 --> 02:43:36,100
It's a no steroids,
no added hormones.

3849
02:43:36,190 --> 02:43:37,330
Yeah,
it's supposed to be grass free,

3850
02:43:37,331 --> 02:43:39,010
right?
Grass fed or grass fed.

3851
02:43:39,310 --> 02:43:40,880
You know what man?
Look what a,

3852
02:43:40,950 --> 02:43:44,110
what a piece of meat is.
We have all these attachments to what it

3853
02:43:44,111 --> 02:43:45,670
is,
but it's protein and water.

3854
02:43:46,490 --> 02:43:48,460
There's not,
not a lot of like.

3855
02:43:49,260 --> 02:43:54,260
There's good aspects to some of the like
you get healthier fats from grass fed 

3856
02:43:54,311 --> 02:43:56,830
meat because you get a healthier animal.
It's definitely better for you.

3857
02:43:56,830 --> 02:43:59,470
It's probably more nutritionally dense 
for you,

3858
02:43:59,740 --> 02:44:02,230
but you could get by on like regular 
Burgers,

3859
02:44:02,350 --> 02:44:04,810
you can get by on regular steak.
It's still human.

3860
02:44:04,811 --> 02:44:06,190
Body's an amazing thing.
Yeah,

3861
02:44:06,200 --> 02:44:11,200
you school good for your body.
Your body's taken that animal protein 

3862
02:44:11,200 --> 02:44:11,860
and it's breaking it down and it's 
making muscle with it.

3863
02:44:12,070 --> 02:44:17,070
It just does.
And the idea that it doesn't because 

3864
02:44:17,070 --> 02:44:17,770
it's a steak and the stakes bad for you.
That's stupid.

3865
02:44:17,771 --> 02:44:19,810
It's a potato.
Potatoes are good for you.

3866
02:44:19,960 --> 02:44:21,130
Okay.
You say a baked potato,

3867
02:44:21,190 --> 02:44:22,480
Yay,
that's really good for you.

3868
02:44:22,481 --> 02:44:27,481
Baked potatoes,
the best way this vitamin C and 

3869
02:44:27,481 --> 02:44:27,481
Potassium and baked potato.
As a matter of fact,

3870
02:44:27,481 --> 02:44:29,860
I think there's more potassium in a big 
potato than a banana.

3871
02:44:29,920 --> 02:44:31,220
Yep.
So yeah,

3872
02:44:31,270 --> 02:44:33,130
so you've got.
That's all healthy shit.

3873
02:44:33,131 --> 02:44:36,160
The people don't think that's healthy or
people that are have an agenda.

3874
02:44:36,190 --> 02:44:38,050
They're like either vegans or they.

3875
02:44:38,190 --> 02:44:42,590
They want to promote some really radical
idea of nutrition knife.

3876
02:44:42,670 --> 02:44:46,780
My favorite comment on the Metamorph,
the premed Morris video was a gary.

3877
02:44:46,781 --> 02:44:49,680
Tony needs to stop eating cheeseburgers 
and buy some proactive,

3878
02:44:50,320 --> 02:44:53,030
proactive like for visits or whatever.
Oh,

3879
02:44:53,350 --> 02:44:53,890
this.
Oh.

3880
02:44:53,891 --> 02:44:55,780
How dare they ruin.
That's awesome.

3881
02:44:55,960 --> 02:45:00,380
Do you use anything like defense soap?
Do you fuck with that stuff for awhile?

3882
02:45:00,430 --> 02:45:01,060
I,
you know,

3883
02:45:01,061 --> 02:45:03,480
a gooey soap was giving me some stuff I 
haven't had.

3884
02:45:03,481 --> 02:45:05,350
I haven't had anybody.
Hope is the best,

3885
02:45:05,410 --> 02:45:06,250
best,
best.

3886
02:45:06,490 --> 02:45:08,880
They just sent me a box of it.
I get,

3887
02:45:08,980 --> 02:45:10,660
I panic when I get low.
I used.

3888
02:45:10,661 --> 02:45:13,170
I'm just such good soap too.
Just like that stuff that.

3889
02:45:13,171 --> 02:45:16,900
It's like a surgical scrub that you use.
That shit ain't good for you dude.

3890
02:45:16,901 --> 02:45:17,650
No,
no.

3891
02:45:17,651 --> 02:45:22,651
That antibiotic soaps now good for you 
because it kills your natural skin 

3892
02:45:22,651 --> 02:45:23,560
flora.
The stuff that they use for hospitals,

3893
02:45:23,561 --> 02:45:24,580
man,
that's intense.

3894
02:45:24,581 --> 02:45:29,581
Antibiotics.
What they try to deal with and use it 

3895
02:45:29,581 --> 02:45:29,581
for my face.
Just because the and everything.

3896
02:45:30,200 --> 02:45:33,040
It might be causing the proactive work 
though.

3897
02:45:35,250 --> 02:45:36,840
I use it for a little bit.
It worked out right?

3898
02:45:37,710 --> 02:45:42,710
Sometimes nothing works use.
You can only use something for so long 

3899
02:45:42,710 --> 02:45:44,210
and it just gets fucking whatever.
Just wash my face every once in a while.

3900
02:45:44,820 --> 02:45:46,900
I used to have a friend at work as a 
friar later cook.

3901
02:45:46,901 --> 02:45:49,360
This motherfucker had the worst I've 
ever seen in my life.

3902
02:45:49,520 --> 02:45:52,640
A lot of tax environmental.
When you're.

3903
02:45:54,450 --> 02:45:56,860
When you're famous for choking people 
out and breaking legs,

3904
02:45:57,130 --> 02:45:58,600
it don't matter.
What if you have zits.

3905
02:45:58,900 --> 02:46:03,900
Eddy brothers says it doesn't matter,
so don't worry about just telling him 

3906
02:46:03,900 --> 02:46:03,900
that.
Next,

3907
02:46:03,900 --> 02:46:03,900
just keep winning.
That's the plan.

3908
02:46:03,900 --> 02:46:05,290
Anyway,
that's what I was gonna focus on and set

3909
02:46:05,291 --> 02:46:07,840
them up,
but I don't know how it goes with Zits,

3910
02:46:07,841 --> 02:46:10,160
but I know with your skin it's actually 
important to not

3911
02:46:10,160 --> 02:46:15,110
use the antibacterial soap and they also
say you shouldn't shower like any closer

3912
02:46:15,111 --> 02:46:20,111
than a half an hour before your match 
because orbit before you train rather 

3913
02:46:20,111 --> 02:46:23,390
because it takes your body time to 
reestablish the skin for the antibodies.

3914
02:46:23,920 --> 02:46:26,690
Wrote a whole thing about that is the 
guy who owns different soap.

3915
02:46:26,750 --> 02:46:29,610
He wrote a whole thing about that on the
think it was on the undergraduate.

3916
02:46:29,630 --> 02:46:31,310
Not supposed to take a shower before you
roll.

3917
02:46:31,340 --> 02:46:32,960
No,
don't put that out there.

3918
02:46:32,961 --> 02:46:34,370
Now people are going to show up.
Snow.

3919
02:46:34,371 --> 02:46:36,860
Just stick at it.
It's got to be more than a half an hour.

3920
02:46:37,100 --> 02:46:42,100
More than a half an hour for your skin 
health and probiotics you fuck with 

3921
02:46:42,100 --> 02:46:46,031
probiotics?
Only to like settle my stomach 

3922
02:46:46,031 --> 02:46:46,031
occasionally.
Not like for the,

3923
02:46:46,031 --> 02:46:46,250
not for the,
uh,

3924
02:46:46,490 --> 02:46:51,490
for the prevention of like a steady 
bravo preaches that ringworm ever.

3925
02:46:52,170 --> 02:46:53,900
Um,
I've gotten into a few times.

3926
02:46:53,900 --> 02:46:56,480
It's not like a consistent problem like 
some people have with it.

3927
02:46:56,550 --> 02:46:57,550
Uh,
you know,

3928
02:46:57,720 --> 02:46:59,750
got staff once.
So it wasn't,

3929
02:46:59,751 --> 02:47:01,160
you know,
I caught it before it was serious.

3930
02:47:01,180 --> 02:47:06,180
I don't,
I don't know how some people like let 

3931
02:47:06,180 --> 02:47:06,180
staff go to the point where a spider 
bite,

3932
02:47:06,180 --> 02:47:08,140
a fucking spider bite on your skin.
Like this big like,

3933
02:47:08,210 --> 02:47:09,600
dude,
as soon as I felt like,

3934
02:47:09,620 --> 02:47:10,240
like,
you know,

3935
02:47:10,300 --> 02:47:12,290
a big swollen fucking pimp while I was 
like,

3936
02:47:12,291 --> 02:47:13,610
yeah,
it's probably staff.

3937
02:47:13,611 --> 02:47:15,530
I should go get that look at.
And I started to get sick.

3938
02:47:15,531 --> 02:47:16,100
I was like,
yeah,

3939
02:47:16,830 --> 02:47:21,830
seems about right.
I don't know how people don't get that 

3940
02:47:21,830 --> 02:47:24,371
shit.
Some people are not tuned into their 

3941
02:47:24,371 --> 02:47:24,371
body,
man.

3942
02:47:24,371 --> 02:47:24,371
I told you the red should fear story,
right?

3943
02:47:24,371 --> 02:47:25,910
We were playing pool and he was limping.
I'm like,

3944
02:47:25,911 --> 02:47:28,280
why are you limping man?
He's just got a spider bite my knee.

3945
02:47:28,400 --> 02:47:29,800
I go,
what are the.

3946
02:47:29,801 --> 02:47:31,460
Let me see your leg,
and I go,

3947
02:47:31,461 --> 02:47:32,480
dude,
that staff,

3948
02:47:32,481 --> 02:47:37,481
you've got to go to a doctor right now.
His knee was all swollen and there was 

3949
02:47:37,481 --> 02:47:38,120
like a Zit and I was like,
Holy Shit Dude,

3950
02:47:38,121 --> 02:47:40,280
this is ugly.
Eddie has a good story about this.

3951
02:47:40,281 --> 02:47:42,380
He's training with a dude that had like 
a giant hole in his,

3952
02:47:42,400 --> 02:47:47,400
but he didn't actually train with them 
because as soon as he saw the fucking 

3953
02:47:47,400 --> 02:47:47,400
hole,
it was like,

3954
02:47:47,400 --> 02:47:47,400
let me stay the fuck away from that guy.
He's like,

3955
02:47:47,400 --> 02:47:47,400
dude,
what's wrong with you?

3956
02:47:47,430 --> 02:47:48,680
You're,
you definitely have staff,

3957
02:47:48,681 --> 02:47:49,760
man.
He's like,

3958
02:47:50,030 --> 02:47:51,350
he's like,
you should go to the doctor.

3959
02:47:51,351 --> 02:47:52,220
He's like,
yeah,

3960
02:47:52,221 --> 02:47:54,470
I've been rubbing some like honey on it 
and stuff.

3961
02:47:54,471 --> 02:47:56,210
I'm really not into like,
you know,

3962
02:47:56,211 --> 02:47:58,970
the doctor and like into like natural 
remedies and stuff,

3963
02:47:58,971 --> 02:48:01,010
you know,
just going to keep putting honey on it.

3964
02:48:01,010 --> 02:48:03,110
It's going to be fine.
Those anti banners,

3965
02:48:03,540 --> 02:48:05,720
those anti-vaccine dudes,
he's dead right now,

3966
02:48:05,721 --> 02:48:07,800
but it's better for the human race 
because you know,

3967
02:48:08,020 --> 02:48:09,500
do we really want that to keep living 
on.

3968
02:48:09,830 --> 02:48:14,830
Brian Cowen,
his friend's wife died from staph 

3969
02:48:14,830 --> 02:48:15,740
infection and she tried to teach,
treat it naturally and holistically.

3970
02:48:15,850 --> 02:48:20,850
They were like doing like all these 
different weird things and he said he 

3971
02:48:20,850 --> 02:48:22,220
came up with the house and he said she 
looked like death and her gums were pale

3972
02:48:22,580 --> 02:48:24,230
and he was like,
Jesus fucking Christ.

3973
02:48:24,231 --> 02:48:25,570
Get her to the doctor,
man.

3974
02:48:25,610 --> 02:48:27,530
Get her to a hospital.
They take her to a hospital.

3975
02:48:27,531 --> 02:48:29,390
It's too late.
They get her on the ivy drip.

3976
02:48:29,820 --> 02:48:31,440
They're trying to give her an 
antibiotic.

3977
02:48:31,610 --> 02:48:35,780
Died at like 25 years old,
30 years old because they didn't do this

3978
02:48:35,810 --> 02:48:40,810
exactly.
And especially Murcia like the 

3979
02:48:40,810 --> 02:48:44,140
medication resistant.
There's a bunch of different strains of 

3980
02:48:44,140 --> 02:48:44,140
staff that are really difficult to deal 
with.

3981
02:48:44,140 --> 02:48:45,200
I'm just going to keep rubbing honey on 
it.

3982
02:48:45,201 --> 02:48:46,050
It'll be fine.
Yeah.

3983
02:48:46,100 --> 02:48:50,170
Just take some parsley and you hit it 
with the pores can.

3984
02:48:50,240 --> 02:48:51,590
Yeah.
Perfect.

3985
02:48:52,310 --> 02:48:57,310
Fine.
Those homeopathic motherfuckers are 

3986
02:48:57,310 --> 02:48:59,351
scary.
You got to be real careful with that 

3987
02:48:59,351 --> 02:49:01,361
shit.
There's sometimes you need medicine 

3988
02:49:01,361 --> 02:49:01,361
bench.
Yep.

3989
02:49:01,361 --> 02:49:03,860
Madison fucking like if you could 
syphilis.

3990
02:49:03,890 --> 02:49:06,980
Don't try to pray that shit away.
You need penicillin.

3991
02:49:06,990 --> 02:49:10,080
Motherfucker.
Cillin don't go out like Al Capone.

3992
02:49:10,500 --> 02:49:11,580
Alright.
They figured that out.

3993
02:49:11,600 --> 02:49:12,510
This.
They figured it out.

3994
02:49:12,640 --> 02:49:15,930
Right?
To use the smart dudes knowledge.

3995
02:49:16,590 --> 02:49:19,340
It's like you don't just jump into 
Jujitsu as fucking raw white belt.

3996
02:49:19,341 --> 02:49:21,090
Try to reinvent the game.
Right?

3997
02:49:21,300 --> 02:49:23,070
You shouldn't do that with medicine 
either.

3998
02:49:23,520 --> 02:49:28,520
Non Medicine having motherfucker fucking
try to rub honey on your staff,

3999
02:49:29,130 --> 02:49:30,990
bitch.
That doesn't work.

4000
02:49:31,110 --> 02:49:31,760
Yeah.
Okay.

4001
02:49:31,770 --> 02:49:33,900
If it did,
we would fucking use that.

4002
02:49:33,960 --> 02:49:35,340
Yeah.
If that was the number one moves,

4003
02:49:35,360 --> 02:49:35,900
the rub honey.

4004
02:49:35,900 --> 02:49:36,980
All right man.
Yeah.

4005
02:49:37,260 --> 02:49:37,970
You know,
um,

4006
02:49:38,070 --> 02:49:39,570
our friend bud,
uh,

4007
02:49:39,760 --> 02:49:44,760
his mom has cancer and she's been taking
cannabis therapy for it and they 

4008
02:49:46,501 --> 02:49:48,150
attributed to a bunch of different 
things.

4009
02:49:48,360 --> 02:49:53,360
But one of them being that she,
she's stopped doing chemotherapy and 

4010
02:49:53,360 --> 02:49:58,270
it's at the same time she started doing 
this cannabis and her tumor shrunk by 

4011
02:49:58,270 --> 02:49:59,640
like 30 percent over a period of just a 
few weeks.

4012
02:49:59,820 --> 02:50:04,820
They don't know if it was the 
combination of the chemotherapy and the 

4013
02:50:04,820 --> 02:50:07,101
cannabis oil,
but they know that the cannabis oil has 

4014
02:50:07,101 --> 02:50:09,891
a big,
big effect on it and I've been talking 

4015
02:50:09,891 --> 02:50:12,291
to so many people that know people with 
cancer that have also gone that route 

4016
02:50:12,291 --> 02:50:16,190
and have started taking cannabis oil 
that Rick Simpson oil and a bunch of 

4017
02:50:16,190 --> 02:50:17,250
different cbd oils.
It's amazing.

4018
02:50:17,350 --> 02:50:22,350
I'm hearing about that.
You see that vice documentary on the 

4019
02:50:22,350 --> 02:50:22,530
measles virus and the HIV virus is 
incredible.

4020
02:50:22,710 --> 02:50:27,710
They're using the measles virus,
an HIV virus to kill cancer and it's so 

4021
02:50:27,710 --> 02:50:29,880
far it's working.
Ninety percent is amazing.

4022
02:50:30,390 --> 02:50:35,390
We live in good times.
Man decided to put that episode on 

4023
02:50:35,390 --> 02:50:39,081
Youtube for free so that their gift to 
the world that's showing the progress 

4024
02:50:39,081 --> 02:50:40,950
they've made.
It seems like they've cured cancer.

4025
02:50:41,130 --> 02:50:42,180
So it seems like.
Well,

4026
02:50:42,181 --> 02:50:47,181
if not,
I mean there are certainly making giant 

4027
02:50:47,181 --> 02:50:47,750
leaps and bounds from where they were 
just a decade ago.

4028
02:50:48,180 --> 02:50:50,230
Virus kills cancer.
Not Crazy.

4029
02:50:51,890 --> 02:50:53,740
It's nuts.
Yeah.

4030
02:50:54,390 --> 02:50:59,390
But you get really sick because they 
take you through it and when they gave 

4031
02:50:59,390 --> 02:50:59,390
him this,
uh,

4032
02:50:59,390 --> 02:51:03,310
this measles virus,
they get really go into comas and it 

4033
02:51:03,310 --> 02:51:07,641
almost seems like they're going to die 
but never are going to die anyways with 

4034
02:51:07,641 --> 02:51:10,551
the cancer.
And then they wake up from the coma and 

4035
02:51:10,551 --> 02:51:10,920
then they're cancer free.
That's my man as we live in crazy times.

4036
02:51:10,920 --> 02:51:12,820
Man.
What do you think that.

4037
02:51:12,840 --> 02:51:14,370
This is the last question because we're 
almost out of time,

4038
02:51:14,371 --> 02:51:14,700
right?
Yeah.

4039
02:51:14,760 --> 02:51:15,980
Five of us,
five minutes left.

4040
02:51:16,400 --> 02:51:21,400
Um,
what do you think about performance 

4041
02:51:21,400 --> 02:51:23,571
enhancing drugs?
Because that is a big issue with 

4042
02:51:23,571 --> 02:51:23,571
Jujitsu.
You know,

4043
02:51:23,571 --> 02:51:24,510
Steve Maxwell was just raving about it 
the other day.

4044
02:51:24,511 --> 02:51:25,940
He's like,
they need to do that in Jujitsu.

4045
02:51:25,950 --> 02:51:27,470
There's too many guys that are on the 
news.

4046
02:51:27,690 --> 02:51:28,910
What do you think?
Yeah,

4047
02:51:28,911 --> 02:51:31,710
because it's not in any sense.
I mean,

4048
02:51:31,740 --> 02:51:34,590
they have some light testing that they 
do for ib ggf,

4049
02:51:34,591 --> 02:51:37,500
but it's like one of those situations 
again where like people know what to do,

4050
02:51:37,501 --> 02:51:42,501
like they have enough,
they have advanced notice of the event 

4051
02:51:42,501 --> 02:51:42,501
coming up.
They know if they could be tested,

4052
02:51:42,501 --> 02:51:45,810
whatever they pay after the event.
Is that what it is after the event?

4053
02:51:45,811 --> 02:51:46,840
Is it urine?
Yeah,

4054
02:51:46,841 --> 02:51:49,320
they test the randomly,
like 10 dudes or something like that.

4055
02:51:49,350 --> 02:51:49,920
Oh,
that's it.

4056
02:51:49,960 --> 02:51:51,270
Yeah.
It's something stupid.

4057
02:51:51,650 --> 02:51:54,180
I mean it's a step in a direction.
But um,

4058
02:51:54,210 --> 02:51:56,580
yeah,
I mean it's clearly a rampant um,

4059
02:51:56,760 --> 02:51:58,680
you know,
as to what to do about it.

4060
02:51:59,070 --> 02:52:01,980
Like you either need to you,
there's only two routes.

4061
02:52:02,040 --> 02:52:04,380
There's one you just don't do anything.
Okay.

4062
02:52:04,381 --> 02:52:07,120
And then everybody has their option to 
use it or not use it,

4063
02:52:07,150 --> 02:52:08,100
which,
you know,

4064
02:52:08,170 --> 02:52:08,970
whatever.
I mean,

4065
02:52:08,971 --> 02:52:10,800
you're obviously the people that choose 
not to,

4066
02:52:10,820 --> 02:52:13,690
are going to suffer in terms of the 
disadvantage of not the strength.

4067
02:52:14,200 --> 02:52:18,190
And then the other way to go about is 
you have to do it fucking right and just

4068
02:52:18,191 --> 02:52:23,191
have random testing all the time and in 
a way where people can't fucking cheat 

4069
02:52:23,191 --> 02:52:23,191
it,
you know what I mean?

4070
02:52:23,191 --> 02:52:24,760
Because if,
because if some camps get really,

4071
02:52:24,790 --> 02:52:27,040
which is what happens in Oma,
some camps get really,

4072
02:52:27,041 --> 02:52:30,250
really good at figuring out what the 
ways are to cheat the tests or this,

4073
02:52:30,251 --> 02:52:31,060
that,
and the other thing.

4074
02:52:31,270 --> 02:52:33,670
And then other guys aren't gonna fucking
go through that.

4075
02:52:33,671 --> 02:52:36,670
I mean he gives those guys an advantage 
over the other guys that aren't,

4076
02:52:36,730 --> 02:52:38,230
you know what I'm saying?
Of course.

4077
02:52:38,350 --> 02:52:39,430
So it's A.
I mean,

4078
02:52:39,790 --> 02:52:42,550
dude,
I mean in a perfect world that's like,

4079
02:52:42,790 --> 02:52:43,600
yeah,
let's get rid of it.

4080
02:52:43,601 --> 02:52:48,601
But it just seems like there's always,
there's always a way to fucking hide it 

4081
02:52:48,601 --> 02:52:51,990
or always a way to do whatever.
So I'm just gonna keep trying to get 

4082
02:52:51,990 --> 02:52:54,721
better at Jujitsu and you know,
hopefully that saves me instead of 

4083
02:52:54,721 --> 02:52:54,721
bolting biceps,
we'll see.

4084
02:52:54,721 --> 02:52:55,240
Well,
we've also seen a bunch of guys who were

4085
02:52:55,241 --> 02:53:00,241
just two guys that got into mma and then
got caught when they got into mma 

4086
02:53:00,241 --> 02:53:01,660
because then they get tested a little 
bit more thoroughly and assurance out.

4087
02:53:01,661 --> 02:53:03,610
They were probably using it the entire 
time.

4088
02:53:03,820 --> 02:53:04,860
Yeah,
there's tons.

4089
02:53:04,930 --> 02:53:06,070
There's tons of that for sure.

4090
02:53:06,070 --> 02:53:06,880
Jujitsu,
man,

4091
02:53:06,950 --> 02:53:08,590
whatever the case may be,
you know,

4092
02:53:09,050 --> 02:53:11,800
you think about this situation that MMA 
finds itself in.

4093
02:53:11,801 --> 02:53:13,690
Right now I'm looking at an MMA,
you know,

4094
02:53:13,691 --> 02:53:15,310
as a future prospect,
you know,

4095
02:53:15,340 --> 02:53:17,590
getting involved in and you see all 
this,

4096
02:53:17,640 --> 02:53:19,750
you know,
all these guys are testing positive.

4097
02:53:19,751 --> 02:53:24,751
It's kind of sneaky.
Something that Ronda Rousey said was 

4098
02:53:24,751 --> 02:53:24,751
kind of interesting about the idea that 
like,

4099
02:53:24,760 --> 02:53:26,320
oh,
this isn't like baseball wherever,

4100
02:53:26,321 --> 02:53:31,321
using steroids to hit a ball harder,
we're using steroids and people are 

4101
02:53:31,321 --> 02:53:33,160
fucking getting knocked the fuck out.
You know what I mean?

4102
02:53:33,161 --> 02:53:34,270
And that's,
that's scary,

4103
02:53:34,300 --> 02:53:39,300
you know,
and in a sense that people are getting 

4104
02:53:39,300 --> 02:53:39,880
stronger and stronger and have the 
ability to do serious damage to people,

4105
02:53:40,380 --> 02:53:41,500
you know?
So in that sense,

4106
02:53:41,501 --> 02:53:41,890
yeah,
it's,

4107
02:53:41,891 --> 02:53:43,030
I mean,
in a martial art,

4108
02:53:43,031 --> 02:53:44,680
I think that's super dangerous,
you know,

4109
02:53:44,681 --> 02:53:45,700
um,
I,

4110
02:53:46,140 --> 02:53:48,100
you know,
I don't know what the answer is,

4111
02:53:48,190 --> 02:53:53,190
you know what I mean in terms of what 
they should do or whatever the case may 

4112
02:53:53,190 --> 02:53:53,410
be with a pds,
but just because there's,

4113
02:53:53,470 --> 02:53:54,670
and it's not even just steroids.

4114
02:53:54,670 --> 02:53:58,030
There's tons of other stuff people can 
be taken dpos and all different kinds of

4115
02:53:58,031 --> 02:53:58,570
things,
you know.

4116
02:53:58,660 --> 02:54:03,660
Well,
there was an article recently online 

4117
02:54:03,660 --> 02:54:05,341
where there were saying that these 
businessmen is middle aged businessmen 

4118
02:54:05,341 --> 02:54:07,540
have taken epo and winning cycling races
just entering into amateur cycling races

4119
02:54:07,541 --> 02:54:09,530
on Epo and winning them.
And yeah,

4120
02:54:09,540 --> 02:54:14,540
it just gives just such a giant 
advantage when you're dealing with 

4121
02:54:14,540 --> 02:54:14,890
someone who has some cycling,
you are cycling,

4122
02:54:14,891 --> 02:54:18,030
so you have the muscle strength and then
all of a sudden you have this superhuman

4123
02:54:18,130 --> 02:54:19,110
endurance.
Yeah.

4124
02:54:19,690 --> 02:54:21,190
So this is fucked.
It's fucked.

4125
02:54:21,280 --> 02:54:26,280
It's weird.
It's weird that it's so many mma 

4126
02:54:26,280 --> 02:54:26,280
fighters are testing positive for it.
Now.

4127
02:54:26,280 --> 02:54:29,670
The epl world of Ali Baba routine off 
who fought for the title again.

4128
02:54:29,671 --> 02:54:30,790
So my name,
mouse Johnson,

4129
02:54:31,180 --> 02:54:36,180
he tested positive for EPO.
Shane Mosley tested positive for evo 

4130
02:54:36,180 --> 02:54:38,020
back in the day.
If you think that's really,

4131
02:54:38,021 --> 02:54:38,950
you know,
you'd say,

4132
02:54:39,120 --> 02:54:44,120
I mean people always say a large 
percentage of professional athletes are 

4133
02:54:44,120 --> 02:54:48,271
on steroids that Duh Duh.
Do you think a large percentage of our 

4134
02:54:48,271 --> 02:54:51,581
on epl as well because cardio so huge.
I know of many that have been on epo.

4135
02:54:52,420 --> 02:54:57,420
I know of many that were on epo back in 
the day at least I know from the 

4136
02:54:57,420 --> 02:54:59,680
anecdotal stories that I've heard from 
people that trained with them that there

4137
02:54:59,681 --> 02:55:03,010
was guys will take a wild west shoot epo
or eat it.

4138
02:55:03,050 --> 02:55:04,040
Good question.
I think

4139
02:55:04,080 --> 02:55:05,930
they have a pill form now though.
Yeah,

4140
02:55:05,931 --> 02:55:07,700
I think so.
I couldn't be wrong about that,

4141
02:55:07,701 --> 02:55:10,280
but I think yeah,
they've made major advances so they used

4142
02:55:10,281 --> 02:55:12,980
to have to do like blood transfusions in
order to do it properly.

4143
02:55:13,010 --> 02:55:14,210
Yeah.
Well there's still guys.

4144
02:55:14,211 --> 02:55:17,330
I'm sure that blood dope.
I'm sure they do that because there's no

4145
02:55:17,331 --> 02:55:20,000
test for that.
When you take your own blood out of your

4146
02:55:20,001 --> 02:55:21,380
body,
you make weight,

4147
02:55:21,530 --> 02:55:25,370
your body has that blood regenerated in 
your body and then you add more blood to

4148
02:55:25,371 --> 02:55:30,371
your body.
You have more oxygen carrying 

4149
02:55:30,371 --> 02:55:32,171
capability.
Take two weeks though for your body to 

4150
02:55:32,171 --> 02:55:32,171
make that blood.
That's a good question.

4151
02:55:32,171 --> 02:55:37,001
I don't know how long it takes,
but guys could easily get a blood 

4152
02:55:37,001 --> 02:55:37,700
transfusion two weeks out.
Matter of fact,

4153
02:55:37,701 --> 02:55:40,670
that would give you plenty of time to 
recover if you want it to do that.

4154
02:55:40,670 --> 02:55:42,710
If you say,
if you take Saturday and Sunday off,

4155
02:55:43,010 --> 02:55:44,630
you know you train all week,
you just say,

4156
02:55:44,631 --> 02:55:49,631
okay,
I'm going to get a blood transfusion 

4157
02:55:49,631 --> 02:55:49,631
Friday or a blood,
a withdrawal,

4158
02:55:49,631 --> 02:55:50,300
they're going to take my blood out 
Friday,

4159
02:55:50,510 --> 02:55:51,980
you know you have the weekend to 
recover.

4160
02:55:51,981 --> 02:55:56,981
You go back on Monday,
you start training again and then they 

4161
02:55:56,981 --> 02:55:57,980
hold onto that blood for two weeks and 
then Jack that shit back in your system.

4162
02:55:57,981 --> 02:56:02,981
You would most certainly have some sort 
of a performance advantage from that and

4163
02:56:03,021 --> 02:56:05,780
I don't think they can detect that.
I really don't.

4164
02:56:05,890 --> 02:56:07,970
Yeah.
That was what the bikers used to do.

4165
02:56:08,000 --> 02:56:09,430
That was with all the cyclists used to 
do it.

4166
02:56:09,431 --> 02:56:10,350
Yeah.
It's,

4167
02:56:10,600 --> 02:56:14,000
it's just,
it's a fascinating time where people are

4168
02:56:14,060 --> 02:56:18,080
learning more and more about how to 
cheat and then how to stop cheating.

4169
02:56:18,220 --> 02:56:20,600
You know,
like the shit that had hector lumbar got

4170
02:56:20,601 --> 02:56:21,140
caught for.

4171
02:56:21,140 --> 02:56:23,690
I've never even heard of it before.
She designer steroid.

4172
02:56:23,691 --> 02:56:28,691
That was like really expensive exotic 
shit that it was that clear stuff that 

4173
02:56:28,691 --> 02:56:33,521
I'm very bonds and the victor connotate 
stuff where they thought that nobody 

4174
02:56:33,521 --> 02:56:34,160
knew how to detect it.
Yeah.

4175
02:56:34,800 --> 02:56:36,830
I don't know ma'am.
Strictly.

4176
02:56:36,970 --> 02:56:39,830
It's a very tricky,
but Rhonda is point is as valid as fuck.

4177
02:56:40,180 --> 02:56:45,180
It's a different thing.
They're landing punches that you 

4178
02:56:45,180 --> 02:56:45,180
probably wouldn't be able to land.
You're doing damage,

4179
02:56:45,180 --> 02:56:49,930
especially when you're dealing with some
sort of a war where one person surges 

4180
02:56:49,930 --> 02:56:51,260
and comes on at the end and stops that 
person.

4181
02:56:51,500 --> 02:56:54,170
You know?
That's probably a big part of it.

4182
02:56:54,350 --> 02:56:55,180
Yep.

4209
02:58:05,341 --> 02:58:07,320
God Damn it.
This is fucking chaos.

4210
02:58:07,530 --> 02:58:09,570
The $10,000
grand prize.

4211
02:58:09,890 --> 02:58:13,470
I dare anyone to watch this and tell me 
this is not exciting.

4212
02:58:13,471 --> 02:58:14,850
This is some crazy shit.
This one,

4213
02:58:14,851 --> 02:58:17,520
this is all about all about encouraging 
urgency.

4214
02:58:17,521 --> 02:58:20,790
So what I did was,
is winner take all.

4215
02:58:20,820 --> 02:58:22,800
It's like a game show.
No one else gets paid,

4216
02:58:22,801 --> 02:58:26,130
just a winner to ensure urgency and 
each.

4217
02:58:26,320 --> 02:58:29,430
So the winner has to win four matches 
and he only gets paid on the matches.

4218
02:58:29,431 --> 02:58:32,250
He winds and regulation.
So there's $2,500

4219
02:58:32,340 --> 02:58:37,340
per match,
so it's a possible 10 grand that he 

4220
02:58:37,340 --> 02:58:40,341
could win.
And this is only gonna get bigger and 

4221
02:58:40,341 --> 02:58:40,341
bigger.
We're going to go 50 grand.

4222
02:58:40,341 --> 02:58:40,920
We're going to go under grant eventually
a million.
