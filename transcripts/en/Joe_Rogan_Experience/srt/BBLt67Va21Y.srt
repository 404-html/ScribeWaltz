1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,330
Do Bond

2
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:07,280
and

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,890
am live.
Ooh.

4
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:11,920
Take a sip of that delicious coffee at 
the best coffee.

5
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:13,630
So is that an advocate?
Me Fight.

6
00:00:13,631 --> 00:00:14,830
Claw.
It sure is.

7
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:20,630
Just have it on here.
You guys have the same one as this 

8
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:20,630
caveman coffee tastes going.
Who hooked me up with.

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,840
There you go.
Here you go.

10
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:25,780
We need to Redo those.
So did you hear?

11
00:00:25,781 --> 00:00:29,260
There was some fights this weekend.
I mean I breezed by him.

12
00:00:29,261 --> 00:00:34,261
I saw the highlights.
I thought you brought me on to talk 

13
00:00:34,261 --> 00:00:34,261
politics.
Let's trump get onto that.

14
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:40,960
Nobody.
Nobody's talking about politics these 

15
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:40,960
days.
Thank God important thing.

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,140
We should bring it up because it's not 
like I.

17
00:00:43,141 --> 00:00:48,141
I went on a few celebrities,
twitter pages and I was like freaking 

18
00:00:48,141 --> 00:00:49,270
out.
Freaking out.

19
00:00:49,271 --> 00:00:51,880
They won't shut the fuck up about it.
It's nonstop.

20
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,810
Nonstop.
And half of it is almost like,

21
00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:00,720
I think like they want everyone to know 
that they're upset.

22
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:04,930
They want everyone to know that they're 
one of the upset people and they're,

23
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:06,940
they're not one of the make America 
great again.

24
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:10,450
People they promote that they're upset.
Like I promote a live show.

25
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:15,890
I want people to know where they're at,
where they stand on it was this one 

26
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:19,411
female comic.
I go to her page every now and then and 

27
00:01:19,411 --> 00:01:23,110
I just go Jesus Christ to.
I almost want to send a dm just like you

28
00:01:23,111 --> 00:01:24,880
gotta chill out.
Just relax,

29
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:30,330
chill out.
We'll just see what is happening with 

30
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:30,330
Amy Schumer.
Oh,

31
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:31,660
so anti trump.
But you can't,

32
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:33,330
you can't make it that,
that,

33
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:38,380
that part of the act like we were 
putting in tickets and people just like 

34
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:38,560
walking out,
but she keeps harping on it.

35
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:40,110
Well,
you know,

36
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:45,390
there's two ways to look at is one way 
that people will say they have a voice 

37
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:46,690
and if they have a voice it needs to 
get,

38
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,720
you know,
they need to use that voice to get the 

39
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:51,720
word out.

40
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,150
Not at a comedy show though.
Yeah.

41
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,450
I didn't mean to cut you.
Right,

42
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,000
but make me laugh.
Don't even call her a bitch.

43
00:01:58,001 --> 00:01:59,770
She would call herself a bit.
You know what I'm saying?

44
00:01:59,771 --> 00:02:01,060
This back in the day,
she would.

45
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,130
I mean,
she's like way more.

46
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:06,880
She's way more like political in 
feminist now than ever before.

47
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,810
If you go back to the old amy Schumer 
that was on,

48
00:02:08,811 --> 00:02:10,870
like opie and Anthony,
she wasn't into that at all.

49
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:15,900
She was,
she was like one of the guys that was 

50
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:15,900
like a selling point.
Maybe she was still May.

51
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,660
She got a little older and she was like,
man,

52
00:02:16,661 --> 00:02:19,750
I want to talk about them and stuff,
but that's not the platform for it.

53
00:02:19,751 --> 00:02:23,110
I don't write well if it is,
you got to be really funny.

54
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,390
Like if you have like an anti Donald 
Trump joke,

55
00:02:25,391 --> 00:02:26,830
that's fine.
For sure.

56
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:30,660
It's got to be funny.
It's got to be just like,

57
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:35,790
there's no room for that.
Like it used to be that comics could 

58
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:39,151
have like these rants where they made 
like really important points inside of 

59
00:02:39,151 --> 00:02:40,900
funding wouldn't be funny and people 
kind of accepted it.

60
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,320
But that's what a podcast is for sure.
This a new world.

61
00:02:44,321 --> 00:02:45,900
We live in a new world.
I go to a,

62
00:02:45,901 --> 00:02:47,230
um,
an action movie.

63
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,990
I don't go to an action movie to get a 
massage.

64
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,790
Now all of a sudden when you're in the 
actual movie,

65
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:53,510
someone comes over and massage you,
relax.

66
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:56,710
Do you need to relax?
You need to be less tense because you're

67
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:59,740
really concerned about this action film.
It's really relevant.

68
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:03,640
It was like watching a porno.
I don't give a shit about the story I've

69
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:04,870
asked through.
You know what I'm saying?

70
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,910
I fast forward to the good stuff,
man.

71
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's like I need them.
Some people do like the story with the 

72
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,980
story.
They want these people to be in love or 

73
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,370
they want them to be escaping a bad 
relationship and mommy issues.

74
00:03:18,371 --> 00:03:23,371
I don't know.
I'm just saying there's a place in time 

75
00:03:23,371 --> 00:03:25,411
for it,
like do you see Dave Chappelle on 

76
00:03:25,411 --> 00:03:25,411
Saturday night live?
Funny time.

77
00:03:25,411 --> 00:03:26,370
Made a good point.
Yes.

78
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,430
Yeah,
but he's also supportive is brilliant.

79
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,910
He a master.
He's a master.

80
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:33,820
He's the best.
He's also a very sincere person.

81
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:39,150
Like one of the things that is driving 
me crazy about a lot of this tweeting 

82
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:43,081
and craziness.
Like I was in New York City for the 

83
00:03:43,081 --> 00:03:46,171
fights and me and my friend campaigns.
We went to the gym and young Jamie was 

84
00:03:46,421 --> 00:03:51,421
there too,
but you weren't with us when we were 

85
00:03:51,421 --> 00:03:53,100
stuck in the.
In the swarm of humans with just me and 

86
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:53,100
cam,
we've got to the gym,

87
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,520
no problem,
but on our way back,

88
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:59,670
the protest had marched through the area
that we walked through and all of a 

89
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:00,130
sudden we couldn't go anywhere.

90
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:03,970
It was just jammed with people.
So you're literally shoulder to shoulder

91
00:04:03,971 --> 00:04:06,580
with people like just everybody's 
touching everybody.

92
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:07,930
There's just.
You had to deal with it.

93
00:04:07,931 --> 00:04:12,931
There was nothing to do with,
which is one of the reasons why a fanny 

94
00:04:12,931 --> 00:04:15,391
pack is so important folks,
because you keep your money in your 

95
00:04:15,391 --> 00:04:15,391
front.
Okay?

96
00:04:15,391 --> 00:04:16,240
Nobody's pickpocket and zipped up.
My shirt goes over.

97
00:04:16,241 --> 00:04:19,220
That sentence is going to know to get 
the.

98
00:04:19,221 --> 00:04:24,221
It's going to take some work because 
pickpockets do go to those things you 

99
00:04:24,221 --> 00:04:25,000
need to be aware of.
You're one of those super lefties.

100
00:04:25,001 --> 00:04:27,510
It likes to go going down the street,
shit checked.

101
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:33,180
So while we're walking this one guy with
this perfectly manicured beard,

102
00:04:33,221 --> 00:04:38,221
I'll never forget,
he had a really nice like wool jacket 

103
00:04:38,221 --> 00:04:38,221
on.
He was.

104
00:04:38,221 --> 00:04:41,470
He was obviously like a wealthy liberal 
character and he's screaming out.

105
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,350
I mean screaming in my fucking ear.

106
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,760
He's right here.
He's,

107
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,560
he's touching me.
He's touching me.

108
00:04:47,561 --> 00:04:48,030
The shoulders.
Yeah.

109
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:51,730
Donald trump.
Racist,

110
00:04:51,731 --> 00:04:55,330
sexist,
and he wouldn't stop.

111
00:04:55,331 --> 00:04:57,940
He wouldn't stop partying.
And part of me wanting to go,

112
00:04:57,941 --> 00:05:00,310
hey man,
could you just like if you want to go in

113
00:05:00,311 --> 00:05:02,230
the protest,
the protests in the street,

114
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:05,530
like you're on the sidewalk.
This isn't the protest,

115
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:10,580
you know,
this isn't the answer because some 

116
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:11,650
noncommittal shit you're doing like if 
you want to be out in the be all in.

117
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:13,300
But he's like,
he's doing drive bys.

118
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:17,290
He's like a walk by screaming protests.
But does it really do anything?

119
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,150
He saw a black guy and that distance,
I swear to God,

120
00:05:19,151 --> 00:05:21,870
he starts going shut up lives matter 
black lives.

121
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,510
Hell No.
Hell,

122
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:28,750
that was so obvious.
Just trying to get everybody to join 

123
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,190
them with my friend Michael Shermer 
likes to call virtue signaling.

124
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,030
That's what it is.

125
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,930
He's peacocking his virtue and just 
trying,

126
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:39,390
just trying to get everybody to jump on.
Growing up there was a woman with a sign

127
00:05:40,811 --> 00:05:45,811
that said Rape Melania Cisa,
and apparently that's writing that thing

128
00:05:46,871 --> 00:05:47,890
out.
Crazy.

129
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,750
Here we go.
It's a Hashtag on twitter.

130
00:05:49,751 --> 00:05:51,820
Now,
here's what's crazy,

131
00:05:51,821 --> 00:05:56,821
here's what's crazy.
Twitter allows that Hashtag twitter 

132
00:05:56,821 --> 00:05:59,060
doesn't allow Hillary for prison.
What?

133
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:00,880
Check that.
Make sure that's correct.

134
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:03,230
Biases that make sure that's correct 
because that's what I've been reading.

135
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,420
Jamie,
will you Hashtag Hillary for prison?

136
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:11,330
Look if there's any tweets and then 
Hashtag.

137
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,750
That's ridiculous.
Dude.

138
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,790
There's pictures of people with those 
signs.

139
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:22,260
I don't think it's just one person and 
there's a bunch of people used it who 

140
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,900
call themselves like as if somehow or 
another,

141
00:06:23,901 --> 00:06:26,510
if Donald Trump is a misogynist,
somehow or another,

142
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,550
the way to get them back is to rape his 
wife or even to suggest raping his wife.

143
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:35,670
What kind of messages are you spreading?
If you're posting that and you're in,

144
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:40,810
you're in a protest,
you're making a sign of that fucking 

145
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:40,810
scary.
What does it say?

146
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:41,030
Hillary?
Hillary for prison.

147
00:06:41,031 --> 00:06:42,920
I searched it.
There's a lot of stuff that pops up.

148
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,040
Okay.
Um,

149
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:47,880
well they might spend it in less than 
maybe they abandoned before ms.no.

150
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:52,910
Maybe this guy doesn't know what he's 
talking about and I just read some 

151
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:52,910
nonsense.
Yeah.

152
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:56,710
Maybe I just read some nonsense.
Maybe I could've read some nonsense.

153
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,810
All of it is just bullshit.
It's just bullshit.

154
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:01,880
There was so many,
so many angry,

155
00:07:01,881 --> 00:07:05,930
angry people and um,
well how many celebrities were like,

156
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,640
if trump wins,
I'm out of here.

157
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:08,640
You can't go.
No.

158
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:13,660
Where did you see the fucking signs that
people have made some artists made for,

159
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:19,410
you know,
those benches for bus station benches 

160
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:19,410
where they have the billboard in the 
back of it for real estate sales.

161
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:24,010
Yeah.
It's a real estate sale and it's all 

162
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:24,010
these people who said they're going to 
leave the country.

163
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,400
It's their face.
Like one of them is share.

164
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,520
That's awesome.
I think amy Schumer's got one of them 

165
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,191
to.
Everyone says that you're not doing 

166
00:07:33,191 --> 00:07:33,191
shit.
You ain't going anywhere.

167
00:07:33,191 --> 00:07:34,610
He said she was going to move to Spain,
but she's a fucking comedian.

168
00:07:34,611 --> 00:07:35,190
You know?
It's just like,

169
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:39,260
I guess I'm learning Spanish.
That's just what a comedian would say.

170
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:41,400
See?
Know people freak out,

171
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,760
Matt.
But what she said is that like,

172
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:44,470
you know,
you're,

173
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:49,650
you're,
you're just as disgusting as the people 

174
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:52,181
who voted.
That people will actually expect me to 

175
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:54,671
move or just as disgusting as the people
who voted for that anti gay woman hater 

176
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,310
or whatever,
whatever she called them,

177
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:03,670
but series of insults,
she just so upset and then obviously 

178
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:05,380
she's performing.
She's doing theaters in stadiums,

179
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:08,120
even bigger arenas.

180
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:08,900
I mean,
she's killing it.

181
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:14,140
She's been to Kennedy Election Day sale.
Meanwhile,

182
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,700
here's what you need to understand.
If you do,

183
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:17,810
great.
By the way,

184
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,750
if you do wind up moving to Canada,
when you move to Canada,

185
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:25,900
you realize that Canada has a very 
similar immigration policy to a Donald 

186
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:28,670
Trump is proposing strict,
very strict.

187
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:32,120
It's incredibly difficult to immigrate 
to Canada.

188
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:37,300
You don't just do it like that.
You don't just go over there and all of 

189
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:40,121
a sudden you live there.
I mean maybe for Amy Schumer and you've 

190
00:08:40,121 --> 00:08:40,121
got some cash.
Maybe it's still straight.

191
00:08:40,121 --> 00:08:41,280
People don't realize how strict it is.
Fucking strict.

192
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,470
I'm just going to go to Cayman.
No.

193
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:47,480
Yeah.
It's essentially very similar to a 

194
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,500
Donald Trump is proposing.
Here's the thing about Canada and I love

195
00:08:48,501 --> 00:08:50,450
Canada.
I'm a huge fan.

196
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:52,100
They're like some of my favorite people 
in the world.

197
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:57,490
When you go to Canada,
if you have a drunk driving thing on 

198
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:57,750
your record,
you can't get in.

199
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:03,260
They fucking send you home habits all 
the time to deal with the UFC too with 

200
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:08,470
American fighters.
If you have anything you the chance to 

201
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:08,470
be getting up there,
getting cleared.

202
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:09,650
Customs as strict as shit.
Yeah.

203
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:12,030
Kevin James got into,
you know,

204
00:09:12,031 --> 00:09:17,031
just a standard fistfight once when he 
was younger and I believe he was,

205
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,110
I believe he was arrested but no charges
were filed and was all dropped.

206
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,480
It was one of those,
you know,

207
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:28,490
there's a brawl and he was a part of it 
and he got arrested with a couple other 

208
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:28,490
people.
No big deal.

209
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:32,500
You something a young guy did.
He lived here to fucking to just for 

210
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,840
laughs and they flag them for it.
Turned them around.

211
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Eddie Bravo went up there.
Eddie Bravo legally was carrying a gun 

212
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,940
legally because he was.
No,

213
00:09:40,941 --> 00:09:41,130
no,
no.

214
00:09:41,131 --> 00:09:46,131
Listen to me.
He was working for a cash checking 

215
00:09:46,131 --> 00:09:46,131
business.

216
00:09:46,131 --> 00:09:46,131
This is way back in the day before I 
even met him,

217
00:09:46,131 --> 00:09:51,020
and Eddie used to have to carry around a
large sums of cash and he had a license 

218
00:09:51,331 --> 00:09:56,331
to carry a pistol because of that,
so he gets pulled over for speeding or 

219
00:09:56,331 --> 00:09:59,400
something and he tells the cop.
He goes,

220
00:09:59,401 --> 00:10:00,930
hey man,
just so you know,

221
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:06,230
I work for a check check cashing company
and I carry large sums of cash and I 

222
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,020
have a pistol and it's loaded and it's 
in the car,

223
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:07,950
and the guy goes,
okay,

224
00:10:07,951 --> 00:10:10,800
we'll step out of the car.
Give me all your paperwork in this down.

225
00:10:10,801 --> 00:10:12,390
I'm going to have to handcuff you while 
we check this out.

226
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,470
So check it out.
They go,

227
00:10:13,471 --> 00:10:14,280
Yep,
you're all good.

228
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,320
They let him go,
so nothing right,

229
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,420
no charges,
nothing.

230
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:22,550
Carrying a pistol illegally.
Every time he goes to Canada it comes 

231
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:22,550
up.

232
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:22,550
Damn Dude,
he got so bad.

233
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,330
Then when would go to Canada,
I would ditch him.

234
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,700
I didn't want to get pulled in 
emigration.

235
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,790
If I said it a know if I said I was with
him,

236
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:32,790
they pulled me in to integrate 
immigration to the show.

237
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,260
Dude,
I got stuck there for a fucking hour and

238
00:10:34,261 --> 00:10:36,190
a half ones.
They might not let his ass thing because

239
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:41,200
the conspiracies like we just can't 
tower tower at our live shows because we

240
00:10:43,591 --> 00:10:46,200
keep getting so do you not hate each 
other?

241
00:10:46,201 --> 00:10:47,790
How's it work?
Get out at it.

242
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:52,230
I love Eddie and then someone started a 
literally a chant or seventh.

243
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:58,530
Just see that fucking meme with Tony 
Ferguson when Tony Ferguson beat Hoffeld

244
00:10:58,531 --> 00:11:00,690
dos Anjos.
Eddie Bravo was saying something.

245
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:02,730
It's like when your boy just winds his 
fight,

246
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:06,390
but you have some new information about 
tyler and he's like,

247
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:11,680
he's all open to whoever made that is 
brilliant there to listen.

248
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:17,490
My brother,
anybody that thinks I don't love Eddie,

249
00:11:17,491 --> 00:11:22,491
you're crazy.
Whatever nutty things that he believes 

250
00:11:22,491 --> 00:11:22,491
that I don't believe I don't give a 
fuck.

251
00:11:22,491 --> 00:11:22,940
I love that dude.
No.

252
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,100
Yeah,
I still love him too.

253
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:29,120
He's my friend.
He's just batshit crazy and in his kind 

254
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,881
of way.
I still liked that flavor that he's 

255
00:11:31,881 --> 00:11:31,881
delivering toys.
That shit.

256
00:11:31,881 --> 00:11:33,030
He's so into it.
He loves it.

257
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:35,140
He'll send me.
Was texting nonstop about it.

258
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:40,400
He sends us group texts.
You see the latest one is putting on 

259
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,551
twitter about some of it's grainy 
footage that looks like it was invented 

260
00:11:43,551 --> 00:11:44,850
back when the fucking wheel was 
invented.

261
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:50,150
It's grainy footage of some guy talking 
about the sex parties they used to have 

262
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:52,620
with children whose to pro.
Hillary is not Satan.

263
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:53,950
You don't really think she's saying 
that.

264
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:59,700
I don't man.
I kinda find it hard to believe in the 

265
00:11:59,700 --> 00:11:59,700
lash out at me.
I'm sorry.

266
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:03,070
I say tenant colts when you see shit 
like eyes wide shut though.

267
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:08,130
Don't you want to know?
Can you hear about like the skull and 

268
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:08,130
bones stuff these do at Yale?
Yeah.

269
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:08,130
That's just real.
Yeah,

270
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:09,920
like that is real.
So I would,

271
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:14,930
I would wonder like if you grow up in 
the Hamptons or you live in a like one 

272
00:12:15,161 --> 00:12:20,161
of those crazy Connecticut towns where 
all those super billionaire hedge fund 

273
00:12:20,161 --> 00:12:23,131
characters live and all their kids go to
the private schools that get sent to 

274
00:12:23,131 --> 00:12:25,360
these big fucking universities and you 
get pledged to a fraternity because your

275
00:12:25,361 --> 00:12:30,361
dad was in it and you know there's a lot
of that shit going on there called the 

276
00:12:30,361 --> 00:12:30,361
skulls right.

277
00:12:30,361 --> 00:12:32,070
That's,
like I said,

278
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:33,400
was just the skulls.
No.

279
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:35,420
Well,
there probably might be a goal too.

280
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:36,810
Yeah,
maybe it isn't movie.

281
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,530
They would never invite us into that 
stuff.

282
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,190
They just won't shut the fuck up.
Dot chatty.

283
00:12:42,191 --> 00:12:45,490
Cathy's he tell them anything.
They just blasted on the show.

284
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,980
I can't have them on the.
We would never know.

285
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,410
There's no anybody that thinks we're 
getting in on the Illuminati.

286
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,950
I get accused of that so much because of
the flat earth people,

287
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,090
the flat earth people believe I'm.
I'm a paid shill.

288
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,610
I know I get is.
Oh,

289
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,990
you're just going to leave the UFC and 
step right into that.

290
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:04,180
You don't think that's the Illuminati 
working?

291
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,550
You don't think he's part of it.
Rogan dragged him into it.

292
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,570
Yeah,
man.

293
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:10,030
You don't think I would chat away on my 
show about.

294
00:13:10,031 --> 00:13:14,680
It would be a hilarious is if there 
really was sort of organization that was

295
00:13:14,681 --> 00:13:18,430
paying people off to lie about the earth
being flat,

296
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,440
that would be amazing.

297
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:22,960
If like we were able to keep it that 
hush hush.

298
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:28,230
If the world was flat this whole time 
and all these people that claim to be 

299
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:31,561
flying around it in a big circle,
like people have navigated the globe in 

300
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:31,561
a plane,
they flying,

301
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:35,170
flown over it in a plane and they were 
all in on it.

302
00:13:35,171 --> 00:13:36,490
They're all good just to.
Everyone's in.

303
00:13:36,491 --> 00:13:37,710
I go over their house,
Ferrari,

304
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:40,510
tesco,
everybody's partying like,

305
00:13:40,511 --> 00:13:42,070
what'd you get out of this money?
Shut the fuck up,

306
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:42,640
dude.
Shut up.

307
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:45,070
Just from just from a boat going around 
the world.

308
00:13:45,071 --> 00:13:45,670
Yeah,
man.

309
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,810
It's all flat.
Earth money.

310
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,550
Flatter,
denial.

311
00:13:48,551 --> 00:13:49,480
Money.
Huge.

312
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:52,090
This is a.
This is the world that he probably lives

313
00:13:52,091 --> 00:13:53,500
in.
He hasn't quite gone flat.

314
00:13:53,501 --> 00:13:54,550
Earth.
Flat.

315
00:13:54,551 --> 00:13:57,020
Earth pulls them back.
They start messing with it a little bit.

316
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,120
He did.
He did,

317
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,650
but he went.
Dinosaurs aren't real.

318
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,960
Dinosaurs aren't real,
and the in the moon is fake.

319
00:14:01,961 --> 00:14:03,160
We've never been to the moon.
Well,

320
00:14:03,161 --> 00:14:05,950
not only that,
all the footage of NASA are all the NASA

321
00:14:05,951 --> 00:14:07,140
footage is fake.
NASA.

322
00:14:07,141 --> 00:14:09,130
Everything was shit and then the,
the bands,

323
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:14,340
all the bands like the Beatles were made
by the CIA and quite apparent to paying 

324
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,250
your claims.
The thing is though,

325
00:14:15,251 --> 00:14:20,251
if you know Eddie and he's a fun dude 
and half of this stuff is because he 

326
00:14:20,251 --> 00:14:24,421
enjoys it.
He enjoys looking at conspiracies just 

327
00:14:24,421 --> 00:14:24,421
like.
And it looks.

328
00:14:24,421 --> 00:14:25,150
Some of them are true,
right?

329
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,340
There's real.
That's the problem.

330
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:28,680
That's the real problem.
The real,

331
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:31,240
some are true.
So he has an argument on some stuff,

332
00:14:31,241 --> 00:14:36,241
but it's hard for keys.
So balls deep into conspiracies that 

333
00:14:36,241 --> 00:14:40,711
it's hard for him to just like deep that
he's bent over like a clothes pin and 

334
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:47,140
his,
his like his ankles are in.

335
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:47,630
Yeah.
He's like,

336
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:50,870
what is this?
That's a nice tower.

337
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,480
Be Ashamed as someone knocked it down 
was just recently.

338
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:58,700
He just posted probably listening to us.
He's so funny.

339
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:02,590
He's so crazy.
But the thing too,

340
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:07,550
he's passionate about it so people think
when him and I discuss it or discuss it,

341
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,110
you know,
and he's so passionate.

342
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:11,750
He's not arguing with.
He's just like tick,

343
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,640
like if you really think something's 
true,

344
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,290
you're like,
come on man,

345
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,250
that's,
that's Eddie.

346
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:19,460
Well here's my take on a lot of this 
shit.

347
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:22,580
There's not that much time.
You don't have much time.

348
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:24,920
You have 24 hours in a day and you got 
to sleep for eight,

349
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:30,310
so that's not a lot of time for me and 
if I go down these goddamn fucking 

350
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:31,460
rabbit holes,
that shit will take forever.

351
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,670
Have done it with.
I've done it with legitimate things.

352
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:36,680
I've done it with a,
you know,

353
00:15:36,681 --> 00:15:41,681
like archeological fucking discoveries 
were all just start reading up on some 

354
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:47,080
crazy temple that they found in Cambodia
and I'm two and a half hours later I'm 

355
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,860
researching this and I'm like,
God,

356
00:15:48,861 --> 00:15:50,480
I got to,
I got shit to do.

357
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:54,050
I got shit to do.
So like for me to do that about ghosts,

358
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:58,100
the facing what some of these conspiracy
theories on her list,

359
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:00,280
you just don't have.
So just the.

360
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:01,580
I mean,
what am I going to do?

361
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:03,330
What are we going to find?
Someone,

362
00:16:03,331 --> 00:16:05,240
the Internet,
no one else has found what I'm saying.

363
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,030
Like I'm fucking Nicolas Cage from 
national treasure.

364
00:16:08,031 --> 00:16:11,730
Like I'm not going to go on this weird 
escapade planning some.

365
00:16:11,731 --> 00:16:14,300
No one else knows and I can just ask the
Eddie because he,

366
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,100
he is a.
yeah,

367
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:20,120
but he'll fucking double black belt.
And conspiracy theories makes you watch 

368
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:20,120
youtube videos.

369
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,980
So he tried to get us during the last 
fight companion.

370
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,840
He tried to put one on two to 25 
minutes,

371
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,340
five minutes to her.
A lifelock.

372
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:28,520
It,
I can't do it.

373
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:30,440
I can't do it.
I don't have it in me.

374
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,440
I don't have an inmate.
I forget what that one was about.

375
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,780
Something about money or something or 
tower.

376
00:16:35,781 --> 00:16:38,630
So he loves him.
He loves does to sport to him.

377
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,820
But you know,
it's what he's into.

378
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:44,120
Yeah.
I don't have time anymore to people.

379
00:16:44,121 --> 00:16:45,220
Oh,
you fucking Solo.

380
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,490
No Bro.
Fuck no,

381
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,920
no,
no.

382
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:51,740
If you solve the Kennedy assassination,
it will not help your life.

383
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:53,650
But it's also not on the Internet.
Hey,

384
00:16:53,651 --> 00:16:55,660
tell you that it's probably not in some 
chat room you're in.

385
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,700
It might be on youtube.
Just kind of find the video.

386
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:02,990
You just got to go down deep enough.
You're going to about 600 views so far.

387
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:07,990
But if we can get it out there,
someone sent me a fucking three hour one

388
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:11,630
just two days ago.
Well to assassination one.

389
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:12,320
I'm like,
I don't,

390
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,450
I can't simply too long.
You can do it anymore,

391
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,420
can't do it,
and if they do figure it out it would be

392
00:17:17,421 --> 00:17:18,440
interesting,
but I don't.

393
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:23,500
I don't see how they could.
I think they're never going to get past 

394
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:23,990
where they're at right now.
There's some evidence.

395
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:27,290
There's some non evidence.
There's some speculation.

396
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,840
There's some,
there's that Zapruder footage,

397
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:34,870
there's some shit.
But is there any expert like actually 

398
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:35,030
opened the case back up?
Like did they really give a shit?

399
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,870
There's not enough evidence right now.
Like current physical evidence.

400
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,000
It's not happening.
It's over.

401
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:46,060
Yeah.
They wouldn't do it anyway because who 

402
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:46,060
are you going to try?
But also everyone gets a shit.

403
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:46,060
He's Dad.
Yeah,

404
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:46,060
everyone's dead.

405
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,900
What are you going to do?
Yeah.

406
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,390
What are you gonna do.
Alright.

407
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,470
Still isn't bringing back.
It's all so fucking weird.

408
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:55,920
Like because we know the government does
a bunch of fucked up things.

409
00:17:55,921 --> 00:17:57,180
We know they do,
but it's,

410
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,730
it's spending time trying to figure it 
out.

411
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:02,730
That's what I was thinking when I saw 
trump sit next to Obama.

412
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:08,110
I wonder if Obama told him how much work
has to actually do and that's why he 

413
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:10,800
lived so fucked up because trump was 
sitting next to obama and it was just.

414
00:18:10,801 --> 00:18:14,010
He looked like Jesus Christ.
He looked like he was like,

415
00:18:14,011 --> 00:18:15,690
what?
I think it hit it.

416
00:18:15,691 --> 00:18:18,660
Hit them.
During that meeting I was like,

417
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,120
this is my daily life.
Here you go,

418
00:18:21,121 --> 00:18:24,420
and he's like,
holy look at it is what it says.

419
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:28,140
Trump reportedly surprised at scope of 
new presidential doozies.

420
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:30,690
Surprised at scope.
God's various.

421
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,600
Well,
it's like you have 100 jobs.

422
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,930
This is a reason why the age so hard.
It shouldn't be one man.

423
00:18:36,931 --> 00:18:41,400
Shannon be responsible for it.
I think you've spoken about it before.

424
00:18:41,401 --> 00:18:46,401
We'd have one guy with that much power 
and to have all that on his pressure 

425
00:18:46,401 --> 00:18:49,380
should be a committee of just straight 
geniuses that figuring it out.

426
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:53,910
Well man,
if you want to look at the bright cloud,

427
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,480
if there's any bright cloud about Donald
Trump being in office,

428
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,610
is that he doesn't.
He's an outsider,

429
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,760
like complete outsiders,
politics guy and so we'll get to see 

430
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,360
just by watching them sort of duke it 
out,

431
00:19:06,361 --> 00:19:08,430
what shape they take,
you know,

432
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,030
we'll get to see like what,
what,

433
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:10,980
what's,
what's.

434
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:14,490
We'll get a better view of the mechanism
behind the machine.

435
00:19:14,491 --> 00:19:17,190
Then if Hillary Clinton was in office,
don't you think with.

436
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,490
I think people are really surprised at 
how little power he's actually.

437
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:25,520
The president actually has probably 
because they think he's going to do all 

438
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:25,520
this crazy stuff and then p room like,
Nah,

439
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,750
bitch don't work like that.
You have jumped through all these holes.

440
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:29,160
The house of Lake state,
all this stuff.

441
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:34,190
Yeah.
Well that's what's going to be 

442
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:34,190
interesting to hear him talk and 
complain about that and see what happens

443
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:38,960
and it's going to be interesting.
We've got a culture battle going on 

444
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,000
right now to like all those people 
marched down the street screaming.

445
00:19:39,001 --> 00:19:41,580
Not My president,
not my president,

446
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:43,180
and he is.
He is though.

447
00:19:43,181 --> 00:19:44,460
I hate to tell you guys.
He is.

448
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:45,300
Well,
he's the,

449
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,760
you know,
you don't like get the president doesn't

450
00:19:47,761 --> 00:19:50,640
become yours so it's not yours.
If you live in the United States though,

451
00:19:50,641 --> 00:19:53,070
he's the president of United States.
You look at me.

452
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,230
Did you say my president,
my president?

453
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:56,690
I do.
You do?

454
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:59,100
Not My president trump.
They'll president.

455
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,120
Yeah.
He's not president,

456
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,960
not my president.
And there's a whole new world of my own.

457
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,640
It is weird.
Yeah.

458
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,950
What?
I don't know.

459
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,660
It's probably.
Look,

460
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:14,840
I think this is what I've been saying,
that we go like this and we go like 

461
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,331
that.
We go right and we go left and this is 

462
00:20:17,331 --> 00:20:17,331
how people always have.
When they go back and forth,

463
00:20:17,331 --> 00:20:18,500
the country goes back and forth.
We tried one way.

464
00:20:18,501 --> 00:20:23,501
We don't like it.
They said he was supposed to be at UFC 

465
00:20:23,501 --> 00:20:23,501
200.
Five was son was there.

466
00:20:23,501 --> 00:20:25,390
Which one?
Donald trump jr got.

467
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:30,470
They're not gonna win any awards for 
good luck or they got a bad looking guy 

468
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:33,500
really well with the youngest,
youngest one or the one who's like 

469
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,050
killing it.
There's one is the one who's got the 

470
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:36,050
hair slicked back.
Darker hair.

471
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,360
I'd have to see him.

472
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,870
He's a nice dude.
It was he cool.

473
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:40,950
He's,
I've,

474
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,680
I've been.
Actually I knew him from a while ago.

475
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,600
He's friends with a friend of mine.
Oh really?

476
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:50,660
Yeah.
So the family is going to have to take 

477
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:50,660
over his other business adventures while
he's president.

478
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,740
How about that whole thing is so crazy,
so weird.

479
00:20:53,741 --> 00:20:55,990
So crazy.
Looking him at him up there.

480
00:20:55,991 --> 00:21:00,991
It's so crazy.
How many of them are going to live in 

481
00:21:00,991 --> 00:21:00,991
the White House?
Do they know?

482
00:21:00,991 --> 00:21:01,420
I don't know.
Didn't win?

483
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,100
Yeah.
I could.

484
00:21:03,101 --> 00:21:05,320
All of them live they want.
Or is there like a cap?

485
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:05,800
Like,
dude,

486
00:21:05,801 --> 00:21:07,270
you can only bring to you.
Can't be up in there.

487
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:10,300
Do you know who I fucking love?
Who is that sheriff?

488
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:12,790
That black sheriff that wears a cowboy 
hat everywhere.

489
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:13,840
Sheriff?
Uh,

490
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:15,850
the gut houses.
Goddamn name.

491
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,580
The one out of Dallas.
I think he is.

492
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,010
We're swimming at the same dude.
He's The Dallas shooting happened.

493
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:23,950
Always?
Yes.

494
00:21:23,951 --> 00:21:24,910
Yes.
Something.

495
00:21:24,911 --> 00:21:26,350
Clark is his name.
Clark.

496
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,540
He's.
He retired.

497
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,650
Did he?
Well,

498
00:21:28,651 --> 00:21:32,110
he recently retired from like Fox News.
Dude's always on.

499
00:21:32,111 --> 00:21:35,410
I want to follow the same guy.
Maybe here I'll find them because I just

500
00:21:35,411 --> 00:21:37,630
started Eric Holder.
What is it?

501
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:41,620
David Clark,
[inaudible] name's David Clark,

502
00:21:41,621 --> 00:21:42,850
Bro.

the attorney general.

504
00:21:44,471 --> 00:21:48,190
You fuck you.
Not American and American.

505
00:21:48,191 --> 00:21:50,500
How do you not know that?
You don't know who eric holder's.

506
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:55,770
How dare you like to do that when I know
someone or other people don't know how 

507
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:55,770
the fuck do you not know that,
bro?

508
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,060
Yeah,
he's a,

509
00:21:58,090 --> 00:21:59,710
he's a fucking character.
That guy.

510
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:03,500
He wears a cowboy hat in honor of his.
What is his family members?

511
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,950
A Dallas Cowboy.
So he wears a Dallas Cowboy.

512
00:22:05,951 --> 00:22:06,620
Had everywhere,
right?

513
00:22:06,621 --> 00:22:08,630
He wears the hat.
Actual cowboy hat.

514
00:22:08,631 --> 00:22:09,940
That's everywhere else,
sir.

515
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:15,590
Um,
there's a crazy picture that he posted 

516
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:16,690
of Donald Trump winning the ellis 
island.

517
00:22:16,691 --> 00:22:21,691
A world award in 1989 standing next to 
Muhammad Ali and Rosa parks.

518
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:26,900
Damn.
I was award for contributing to the 

519
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,701
conditions of inner city inner city 
black youth standing alongside Muhammad 

520
00:22:29,701 --> 00:22:30,880
Ali and Rosa part.
I want to talk about that.

521
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:31,800
Yeah.
Well,

522
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,160
it doesn't help.
Trump is like,

523
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,260
the head of KK was like,
we got,

524
00:22:35,261 --> 00:22:40,261
we,
we basically got them in there like we 

525
00:22:40,261 --> 00:22:40,261
support them.
We're the ones that were.

526
00:22:40,261 --> 00:22:40,690
The reason you got in there,
he had to come out and be like,

527
00:22:40,691 --> 00:22:43,090
I don't,
I'm not cool with that KKK stuff,

528
00:22:43,091 --> 00:22:44,170
man.
Like that's not me.

529
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,530
Kay Kay Kay,
racist,

530
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:51,400
sexist.
It's kind of catchy though.

531
00:22:51,401 --> 00:22:53,380
I wanted to tell him man,
go out into the street.

532
00:22:53,381 --> 00:22:55,740
But I was worried.
I was literally worried in the street.

533
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:56,680
If I said it,
it'd be like,

534
00:22:56,681 --> 00:22:59,590
you fucking racist.
What did you like trump supporter?

535
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:01,780
Like he was.
His vitriol was.

536
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:06,100
And then they're all up on you and the 
be like Joe Rogan.

537
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:06,870
No,
I said,

538
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,200
just go to the.
Come on man,

539
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,690
go over there.
Get over there man.

540
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,240
He's actually protesting.
Don't make me get campaigns.

541
00:23:13,241 --> 00:23:18,241
Get his fucking bone out and start 
fucking working people and be able to 

542
00:23:18,241 --> 00:23:18,241
draw back.

543
00:23:18,241 --> 00:23:20,230
There was no room to draw.
It was just,

544
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,970
it was so crazy how many people were 
there.

545
00:23:21,971 --> 00:23:24,670
It was just strange just to protest 
thousands of people.

546
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,680
You're busy as it is,
but it's,

547
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,370
it's,
uh,

548
00:23:27,371 --> 00:23:32,371
you know,
the cops broke it up like cops were 

549
00:23:32,371 --> 00:23:34,621
screaming and shit.
So it was like that being there at the 

550
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:34,840
weekends with the biggest fights in 
history,

551
00:23:34,841 --> 00:23:37,880
all of it was just so crazy.
It was a.

552
00:23:37,881 --> 00:23:39,220
That was a nutty scene,
man.

553
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,470
Being there and the fans felt surreal.
It felt friendly.

554
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,500
It's.
It happened.

555
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,440
Yeah.
It was like.

556
00:23:45,441 --> 00:23:50,441
It was crazy.
Like the weight of the event was thick 

557
00:23:50,441 --> 00:23:50,441
in the air.
It had this feel to it.

558
00:23:50,441 --> 00:23:52,790
That was very different than any other 
show we'd ever put together.

559
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:58,100
It shows that that was the one show.
I wish I was that because it was so 

560
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:58,100
special.
It's gonna be tough to beat that,

561
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,210
but it'll never be.

562
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:01,610
I mean you'll have big giant events for 
sure,

563
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,460
but it'll never be like that because 
that was the last block.

564
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,450
Yes.
Corruption.

565
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,160
Correct.
That was standing in front of the UFC,

566
00:24:07,161 --> 00:24:12,161
getting into New York.
I got a little worried when I saw where 

567
00:24:12,161 --> 00:24:15,341
it was.
I think when I was in Atlanta doing 

568
00:24:15,341 --> 00:24:15,341
latrobe,
I saul on the,

569
00:24:15,341 --> 00:24:19,420
on twitter,
like the crazy press conference with 

570
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:19,420
connor doing that stuff.
I'm like,

571
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,600
I'm not.
And it was kind of weird.

572
00:24:20,601 --> 00:24:21,020
I was like,
well,

573
00:24:21,021 --> 00:24:22,280
it seems a little gimmicky,
blah,

574
00:24:22,281 --> 00:24:22,820
blah,
blah,

575
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:28,240
and then the way,
and he looked a little more serious and 

576
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:28,240
then the night of the fight.
So I was like,

577
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,900
I mean,
you couldn't have written a better show.

578
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:30,680
I mean,
the,

579
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,720
the,
the fight that night,

580
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:35,180
the way everything happened,
it was amazing.

581
00:24:35,181 --> 00:24:36,590
Man.
By far,

582
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:41,750
the best ufc I've ever seen.
It was by far the main event was almost.

583
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:45,830
It was almost bizarre.
It's almost bizarre how good.

584
00:24:45,831 --> 00:24:50,831
Connor.
It's almost bizarre the way you picked 

585
00:24:50,831 --> 00:24:51,110
apart Eddie Alverez.
Almost bizarre.

586
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:54,050
Like magical.
That's almost the word I wanna use.

587
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:59,080
Correct.
Like he touches motherfuckers with that 

588
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,391
left hand.
Have you ever seen Eddie Alvarez just 

589
00:25:01,391 --> 00:25:02,270
like they'd even look like they were in 
the same planet.

590
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,910
Like one guy like looked like he was 
from Mars.

591
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:07,670
The other guy look like he's just a 
normal dude trying to figure it out.

592
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,870
Well,
it looked like Eddie.

593
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,900
The moment he got hit with like,
what the fuck we could see on his face.

594
00:25:11,901 --> 00:25:14,360
He was like,
holy Jesus,

595
00:25:14,361 --> 00:25:15,590
what am I doing here?
And then he goes,

596
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:16,580
well,
all right.

597
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,280
He's not very good at wrestle.
Let me try this.

598
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:21,350
Wrestling coach like that was your shot.
Oh Bro.

599
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:23,510
You're in for a long night.
I think that he realized like,

600
00:25:23,511 --> 00:25:25,580
Holy Fuck,
boys are already touched up a little bit

601
00:25:25,581 --> 00:25:28,070
when he finally went in for the shot,
you know,

602
00:25:28,071 --> 00:25:30,500
and I just think I'm connor new.

603
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:33,260
Then also that he had them and how calm 
was he?

604
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:36,050
Ridiculous.
Just come upright and just waiting.

605
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,770
And then the accuracy of that Combo that
finally finished Eddie.

606
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,980
That's what I think makes connor so 
specials is accuracy.

607
00:25:42,981 --> 00:25:47,981
When he throws punches,
Eddie's moving as he's laying in this 

608
00:25:47,981 --> 00:25:48,210
stuff.
I've never seen anything like,

609
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,780
like you said,
it was straight up magical and like,

610
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:52,940
all right,
well we've never seen a guy like this.

611
00:25:52,941 --> 00:25:54,410
We just haven't.
I don't know if we ever.

612
00:25:54,411 --> 00:25:56,060
Well either.
It was really interesting too when I was

613
00:25:56,061 --> 00:26:01,061
interviewing him and it's like you've 
got to have some attributes if you want 

614
00:26:01,061 --> 00:26:01,061
to beat me,
you got to be tall,

615
00:26:01,061 --> 00:26:04,691
you've got to be big.
It can be these guys my size to what 

616
00:26:04,691 --> 00:26:08,890
he's doing though it.
So he's a once in a lifetime guy because

617
00:26:09,081 --> 00:26:11,090
he sent in the ceiling,
like there's no,

618
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:12,380
there's no boundaries for him.

619
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:15,050
Like he's just like,
I'll fight nate at 70,

620
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:19,730
I'll,
I'll 45 sure on merch Aldo in 13 seconds

621
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:24,820
and they'll come to 55.
Like we've never seen this kind of 

622
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:27,431
creativity.
And we've also never seen the UFC allow 

623
00:26:27,431 --> 00:26:27,431
someone to do this either.
Yeah.

624
00:26:27,431 --> 00:26:28,250
Well he's just such a unique 
personality.

625
00:26:28,251 --> 00:26:31,910
It's undeniable,
but also his style in a lot of ways.

626
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:36,320
It kind of does a lot of,
like with wonderboy does,

627
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:39,580
but with less kicks,
like he throws kicks to the body.

628
00:26:39,581 --> 00:26:41,030
I'll throw like some front kicks.
I mean,

629
00:26:41,031 --> 00:26:42,950
you know,
like maybe 70 percent as many kicks.

630
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:48,290
Wonderboy is a little more kick heavy,
but it's that sideway style and he's.

631
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,140
But he,
uh,

632
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,700
he,
I think he does it better.

633
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:55,710
Like there's maybe something about the 
focus of the shots that he's landing,

634
00:26:55,950 --> 00:27:00,950
the precision of them because wonderboy 
very rarely like touches somebody up 

635
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:01,770
like that with a punch.

636
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:03,320
He just doesn't have that kind of power.
Yeah,

637
00:27:03,321 --> 00:27:08,321
you're right.
I think wonder is better at surprising 

638
00:27:08,321 --> 00:27:11,361
guys with this kicks in his angles,
but connor set it up and he's landing 

639
00:27:11,361 --> 00:27:13,740
combos that are all so precise in this 
power,

640
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:16,440
like he's touching dudes and you can see
it on their faith.

641
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:19,260
He touched Eddie and Eddie's like,
what stuff?

642
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,220
Well,
not only that,

643
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:25,221
he's like he's hitting them in a 
surprise way and it's not telegraphing 

644
00:27:25,221 --> 00:27:28,731
it at all.
Like his ability to like go from 

645
00:27:28,731 --> 00:27:31,410
bouncing around to launching that shot 
is so quick.

646
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:36,800
It's so.
It's so precise and it's so focused and 

647
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,490
there's no fat in his movements.
It's just.

648
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:43,340
Yeah,
and they said there's going to be a big 

649
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:43,340
announcement afterwards and off these 
girls pregnant,

650
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:45,210
which I mean it's a personal big 
announcement for him,

651
00:27:45,211 --> 00:27:50,211
but I think he said he's going to take 
time off and he wants a piece of the 

652
00:27:50,211 --> 00:27:50,211
Pie.

653
00:27:50,211 --> 00:27:51,390
He wants a piece of wme and what,
you know,

654
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,620
what they're doing now,
which,

655
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:54,780
which is hilarious.
Right.

656
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:55,950
I love it.
Me Too.

657
00:27:55,951 --> 00:27:58,710
I love it.
And he's the first fighter ever that can

658
00:27:58,711 --> 00:28:00,090
talk like this.
How old is.

659
00:28:00,091 --> 00:28:04,260
He was kind of 26,
maybe 27,

660
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:09,030
26,
got to think 28.

661
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:11,400
I think he's a smart guy too.
I don't.

662
00:28:11,401 --> 00:28:16,401
I mean I would hope at least I don't see
him fighting deep into his thirties 

663
00:28:16,401 --> 00:28:16,730
know.
Especially the way he talked to.

664
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,940
He goes,
now that I have a kid,

665
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:23,300
I know what I bring to the table.
I won't be set financially for the rest 

666
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:23,300
of my life.
You guys want me to fight again?

667
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:23,460
Yeah,
I'm leaving.

668
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,690
You need to be set for the rest of my 
life.

669
00:28:24,691 --> 00:28:29,691
I want to.
I want a part of this pie and he's his 

670
00:28:29,691 --> 00:28:30,630
next fight and it's gonna be such a 
fight is with wme.

671
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:32,330
It's not with anyone out there.
If you.

672
00:28:32,331 --> 00:28:35,460
If you think he's fighting for center,
it could be your batshit crazy.

673
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:37,290
That's not happening for a very long 
time.

674
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,750
Maybe.
Maybe they work it out and I don't think

675
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:41,070
so.
I think the next slide again,

676
00:28:41,071 --> 00:28:42,690
I don't know.
That's just me going off.

677
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:46,260
Whatever the hell I think Joe,
but I think his next fight would be nate

678
00:28:46,261 --> 00:28:49,440
for the belt at 55 because if you think 
it could be even Tony,

679
00:28:49,441 --> 00:28:53,100
they're both deserving and we're mma.
Pierce were balls deep in mma.

680
00:28:53,101 --> 00:28:55,620
We love it and one of those guys 
deserves it.

681
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:58,710
As far as numbers and in in a big pay 
per view,

682
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:01,020
it would have to be native to really 
think they would do nate again,

683
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:06,080
100 percent.
I don't think Nader economy will fight 

684
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:06,080
unless it's.
If it's.

685
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:06,990
If that has to be the matchup.

686
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:12,060
I think connor will fight someone out.
I think connor might even fight Woodley 

687
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:17,070
you.
I think you'd see a fight with Woodley 

688
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:17,070
before you see qbb.
Ferguson I think could be the first one.

689
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:17,840
Will fight each other before anything 
else.

690
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:18,930
You know?
Fucking crazy.

691
00:29:18,931 --> 00:29:21,210
It would be if he decided to go up and 
fight Woodley.

692
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:27,800
It's so not.
Obviously Willie has to get through 

693
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:27,800
wonderboy again,
but does he has,

694
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,610
do you think so?
We'll.

695
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,510
We'll say.
Dana said that's the.

696
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:35,540
That's the same thing.
A lot of shit he says is fighting for 

697
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:35,540
the title.
It's good point.

698
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,010
It was like,
Nah,

699
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,740
let me see if I have a title.
Nah.

700
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:39,300
Yeah,
he does that all the time.

701
00:29:39,301 --> 00:29:41,110
I don't think that means anything.
Thanks.

702
00:29:41,111 --> 00:29:46,111
Good point.
I'm just going based off what your boys 

703
00:29:46,111 --> 00:29:46,111
said.
He was like,

704
00:29:46,111 --> 00:29:49,201
that's the next rematch,
but put it on me more your friend than 

705
00:29:49,201 --> 00:29:49,201
mine.

706
00:29:49,201 --> 00:29:50,740
Your real.
You've worked with him forever.

707
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,030
I liked the guy.
Yeah,

708
00:29:52,031 --> 00:29:52,930
yeah,
yeah.

709
00:29:52,931 --> 00:29:57,931
I liked Dana.
I just think you know you have a closer 

710
00:29:57,931 --> 00:30:00,411
relationship so say you're a boy,
but he does say things impulse back if 

711
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:03,880
woodland that's there.
This other thing I worry about though,

712
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:08,910
not.
You don't have to worry about something 

713
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:10,291
to think about.
How much power are they going to give 

714
00:30:10,291 --> 00:30:10,291
connor?
40th five.

715
00:30:10,291 --> 00:30:11,540
50 five slash 70 just wraps up all the 
dude.

716
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,280
You know.
Crazy.

717
00:30:12,281 --> 00:30:14,470
That would be if he did it though,
I say let them do it.

718
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,760
Let them try.
Use is gone.

719
00:30:15,761 --> 00:30:17,920
We can't.
He's got to take this pitching woodley.

720
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:18,820
We'll say.
Let him try.

721
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:23,940
Fuck outwardly a say.
Try whether it would love that you 

722
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:24,070
don't.
Big Woodley looks compared to him.

723
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,790
Ju Ju,
Ju Ju ginormous.

724
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,330
It's so bizarre.
Looking at Woodley inside the octagon.

725
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:28,620
You know what?

726
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,630
He's the most Jack Dude,
I think other than your.

727
00:30:31,631 --> 00:30:33,910
Well Romero.
He's in there.

728
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:35,740
He's in there.
Other one and two.

729
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:38,570
One and two right now.
Interchangeable,

730
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,370
yeah.
Yeah.

731
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:42,400
It depends what you're into,
but you're well flies through the air.

732
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:45,250
You'll weld.
Does backflips at the beginning of every

733
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:50,250
fight at the beginning of your friend.
He goes into the audience or it goes 

734
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:52,891
into the cage and he does backhand 
springs and literally launches himself 

735
00:30:52,891 --> 00:30:57,031
through the air and lands on his feet.
It's the Olympics and it's a solid 

736
00:30:57,031 --> 00:30:57,190
landing and he's 200 pounds.
Correct.

737
00:30:57,191 --> 00:30:58,240
So.
And he's flying.

738
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,290
Flying.
He's the freakiest freak.

739
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,900
Cascade uses.
Yes.

740
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,100
Yeah.
Jesus.

741
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:08,140
Jesus.
My goal being you do that for me.

742
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:17,270
Somebody needs to help him with this 
marketing.

743
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:19,900
Change a word,
but he lost so much.

744
00:31:19,901 --> 00:31:23,040
He lost so much fan support.
When he said a four,

745
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:25,110
four was he say for the gay?
Gee,

746
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,730
we thought he said gay Jesus.
But he said,

747
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:30,790
don't forget Jesus is broken.
English was so bad.

748
00:31:30,791 --> 00:31:35,600
People went bad on them so fast they did
and then he kept calling bisbing boy.

749
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:41,050
Yeah.
Well it's okay because I like that he's 

750
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:41,500
allowed.
If bisbing did that to him,

751
00:31:41,501 --> 00:31:45,760
we had some shit on her hands.
I cannot say that to a man of color.

752
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:47,920
Oh he does.

753
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:52,780
He's so scary.
Poor Weidman in New York.

754
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:57,490
Hometown needed to win bad.
The only getting no love in New York and

755
00:31:57,491 --> 00:32:02,020
then just a fucking knee from Cuba just 
don't,

756
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:04,990
just flew,
flew through the air and as he hit him,

757
00:32:04,991 --> 00:32:07,570
like he was flying over them afterwards.
But,

758
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,670
but you know,
that was insanely impressive,

759
00:32:09,671 --> 00:32:14,671
but you know,
it was almost as impressive as the way 

760
00:32:14,671 --> 00:32:14,671
he took waibans back.
He tripped him.

761
00:32:14,671 --> 00:32:16,300
He's,
they tied up together.

762
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:21,420
He trips.
Weidman throws him to the ground and 

763
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,420
then spins around behind him and takes 
his back like the trip.

764
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:25,290
How about the world class trip trip?
No,

765
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:29,140
that's world class level trip.
Weidman's an absolute monster and he was

766
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:34,150
just throwing them around,
showing them the difference between a 

767
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:38,821
wrestler from the Olympics.
A guy who medaled in every single world 

768
00:32:38,821 --> 00:32:40,010
tournament he entered and

769
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:42,290
built like a Ninja Turtle.
He's ridiculous.

770
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:44,900
And you know,
he has like a fuse disc in his neck.

771
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:49,340
I would assume he had a serious injury 
in his neck just like Weidman has.

772
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:51,860
But why may that disectomy Wyman?
That surgery?

773
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:57,310
He did.
So ul has a big scar in the back of his 

774
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:57,310
neck.
You could see it.

775
00:32:57,310 --> 00:33:00,760
It's like a big slice.
It's all stitched up like ving rhames 

776
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:00,980
from pulp fiction.
Very different.

777
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:03,130
But you know what I'm saying?
The same scar.

778
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:04,460
Black Guy Lights.
Yeah.

779
00:33:04,461 --> 00:33:05,560
It's um,
you know,

780
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:08,720
I've seen it before on other guys,
but spinal surgeries,

781
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:09,920
fucking no joke,
man.

782
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:15,110
I had,
I had Weidman when that fight till then 

783
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:17,530
he won the first round.
But you thought he wanted the second 

784
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:17,530
round when yoga was throwing them 
around?

785
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:17,530
Uh,
no.

786
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:20,060
Not winning,
but I thought as the fight would go on,

787
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:21,110
it would help Weidman.

788
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:25,400
I thought in the second round you well 
started implementing his wrestling and I

789
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:27,440
thought he was running away with it.
And then.

790
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:28,790
So one one,
right?

791
00:33:28,791 --> 00:33:29,510
Yes.
Yes.

792
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:30,490
I thought it was one,
one,

793
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:35,700
one one,
but I thought it was like shocking how 

794
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:38,501
good his wrestling was in comparison and
we know that doesn't mean he doesn't 

795
00:33:38,501 --> 00:33:38,720
show it very,
very rarely,

796
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:43,580
but when he does,
dudes go flying more because he's having

797
00:33:43,581 --> 00:33:46,650
fun,
having a good time to.

798
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:52,000
For Real.
At first when he was talking stuff that 

799
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:52,000
busy,
I'm like,

800
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:52,930
God,
that's a terrible fight for bisping.

801
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:53,780
God,
that's terrible.

802
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:58,920
And then it hit me like five rounds.
Bisbing really doesn't initiate in that 

803
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:02,000
grappling and he has cardio four days.
That's a tough fight to call.

804
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:05,670
At first I'll they get Romeo is going to
fucking destroy business.

805
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:07,610
Not really though.
If you think about it.

806
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:09,470
Not really.
Who knows what could happen,

807
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:14,650
but Dan Henderson caught bisping twice 
bad in their last title fight at 45 

808
00:34:16,251 --> 00:34:19,000
years old or whatever it is to catch him
really bad.

809
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:24,100
And Dan Henderson,
who is one of the most ruthless power 

810
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,550
strikers in the game for sure,
and bisping survived that,

811
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,340
so that's good for bisping was able to 
survive that.

812
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:33,670
You know,
it'd be good to think Yoel Romero 

813
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:34,040
doesn't just have a right hand.
He flies.

814
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:38,260
He literally launches himself at you.
If he gets a hold of you,

815
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:38,830
you,
you,

816
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:41,960
the wrestling coach.
Dan Henderson's a silver medalist in the

817
00:34:41,961 --> 00:34:44,750
Olympics as well.
But it's a different.

818
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:45,860
It's different.
Different.

819
00:34:45,890 --> 00:34:47,150
Yeah.
Especially Dan right now.

820
00:34:47,151 --> 00:34:50,180
What's Dan Forty eight?
I think he's 46 or 45.

821
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:52,640
He's up there either way,
but broome is basically,

822
00:34:52,641 --> 00:34:55,130
you know,
in his prime as an MMA fighter.

823
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,290
Well also there's like the range of 
motion,

824
00:34:57,570 --> 00:34:59,900
like Dan's almost like locked up.

825
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,120
Some would say stiff.
Yeah,

826
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:02,900
he's got.
But if he hits you,

827
00:35:02,901 --> 00:35:04,400
you're Foxville.
But he's like,

828
00:35:04,401 --> 00:35:08,960
his range of motion is very limited.
Whereas well is like a super athlete.

829
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:11,180
He doesn't have any limitations in his 
range of motion.

830
00:35:11,181 --> 00:35:16,181
He's ridiculously flexible.
Like he does like a half split before 

831
00:35:16,181 --> 00:35:16,181
he,
um,

832
00:35:16,181 --> 00:35:20,080
for a fight he was like down there,
like stretching out your like sky's 

833
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,220
range of motions and saying those knees 
in the flying knees though,

834
00:35:22,221 --> 00:35:27,221
a lot of it,
especially with Weidman came from 

835
00:35:27,221 --> 00:35:27,221
Weidman going for that single leg and 
he's like,

836
00:35:27,221 --> 00:35:27,221
go,
go for it again.

837
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,400
See what happens.
Yeah.

838
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:31,280
And were busying doesn't entertain the 
grappling at all.

839
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:32,600
That's true.
That's true.

840
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:35,360
And he stays on the outside and he also 
has that beast of a coach.

841
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,950
But at first right away I was like,
Oh God,

842
00:35:37,951 --> 00:35:40,050
that sucks because I love Bisbee like 
God,

843
00:35:40,051 --> 00:35:40,950
that's a bad fight for him.

844
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:42,690
I was sitting there like,
well,

845
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:45,780
cardio five rounds if he can survive 
those first two,

846
00:35:45,781 --> 00:35:50,700
maybe three dragon lake water.
It's a fun fight to watch that bad,

847
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:52,320
bad boy.
I mean you can't.

848
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:53,790
It's hard to do mma.
Math,

849
00:35:53,791 --> 00:35:54,920
right?
I'm mad man.

850
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,820
Style style matchups though,
right?

851
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:57,190
Yeah,
yeah,

852
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:00,450
yeah.
But I was saying like bisping last,

853
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:03,120
Tim Kennedy,
Tim Kennedy last url,

854
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:04,760
but Tim Kennedy was beating your.
Well,

855
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,100
like that's another thing that you 
always corner did this,

856
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:10,920
that it was fucked up man.
They covered him with water.

857
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:16,190
They threw water on him while he's 
sitting there resting between first 

858
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:17,880
second,
they put an ice pack on him and they,

859
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:21,240
he poured water on himself.
He put her on his legs,

860
00:36:21,241 --> 00:36:26,241
he poured it on his arms,
he poured it all over them and they 

861
00:36:26,241 --> 00:36:26,580
wiped him down.
I mean he was trying to cool himself off

862
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,100
probably,
but you're not allowed to do that.

863
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:33,840
And they spent time wiping him down 
before the round started.

864
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:37,020
So like they wiped him down in between 
the corner,

865
00:36:37,021 --> 00:36:40,890
but then the referee stopped it and made
them wipe them down more because more so

866
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,790
it gets more rest.
Yeah,

867
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:45,580
look for sure.
They are aware when,

868
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:50,650
when that happened with Tim Kennedy,
when Tim Kennedy had fucked up at the 

869
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:51,780
end of that second round,
he absolutely,

870
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:54,390
and on-purpose stayed on that stool long
and then he was,

871
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:59,440
some would say it was a smart move.
Obviously it ended up working in his 

872
00:36:59,440 --> 00:36:59,440
faith.
Smart.

873
00:36:59,440 --> 00:36:59,850
If you're a cheater,
if you're okay with cheating,

874
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,530
but it is cheating,
that's cheating.

875
00:37:01,531 --> 00:37:02,880
You haven't a lot of percentage 
cheating.

876
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:06,450
One hundred percent in that fight and 
the referee should have probably stopped

877
00:37:06,451 --> 00:37:11,451
the fight,
but I'm sure big John didn't want the 

878
00:37:11,451 --> 00:37:13,701
fight to end it.
Didn't want to cheat everybody out of 

879
00:37:13,701 --> 00:37:13,701
the fight and just wanting to get back 
up.

880
00:37:13,701 --> 00:37:15,930
But then you cheat.
Tim Kennedy who has done one person.

881
00:37:15,931 --> 00:37:17,600
You don't want to cheat out of this 
champ.

882
00:37:17,601 --> 00:37:20,580
Tim is walking around like yelling while
this is all going off piste.

883
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:22,080
Yeah,
the whole thing was a mess.

884
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:24,840
It was a mess.
That was a cluster fuck of a moment,

885
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:30,380
but it just shows you.
This guy has a massive amount of 

886
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:34,251
experience in international competition 
in wrestling and there's like a lot of 

887
00:37:34,251 --> 00:37:36,060
shit that goes on and wrestling.
You know where your.

888
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:41,120
You have to take advantage of whatever 
you can to win the all these years of 

889
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,350
high level competition on the 
international scene.

890
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:48,740
He's probably got a bunch of little 
tricks like that he could do to slow 

891
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:48,830
down the pace or give himself a little 
extra time and,

892
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,390
and we and what people.
Oh,

893
00:37:50,391 --> 00:37:51,330
what,
what's 15,

894
00:37:51,331 --> 00:37:52,710
20 seconds?
15,

895
00:37:52,711 --> 00:37:56,500
20 seconds for a guy like Yoel Romero to
replenish giant it.

896
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:01,760
I mean,
you're talking giant night and day 

897
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:01,760
difference for a guy like that.
And I think it was also a 30 seconds for

898
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,870
the Tim Kennedy fight.
If I remember maybe 23.

899
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:08,930
I felt like it was longer than that.
I don't remember talking about stool 

900
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:08,930
gait.
Yeah,

901
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:08,930
Gait.
Um,

902
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:13,580
but also then there's a psychological 
issue because Kennedy now thinks the 

903
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,060
fights over.
Is it not over?

904
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:17,550
Like he doesn't know where he's at.
There's nothing worse than that when you

905
00:38:17,551 --> 00:38:19,250
think the fight's over and like,
oh,

906
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:24,310
back in man,
that's what kills me about glory when 

907
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:26,190
they have that extra round.
Here we go one more round.

908
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:31,400
Imagine you get through three rounds of 
kickboxing and then finally you're 

909
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,800
drinking water.
You got your arms up her for her.

910
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,500
He says blah,
blah,

911
00:38:34,501 --> 00:38:34,800
blah,
blah.

912
00:38:34,801 --> 00:38:39,340
And it's draw.
What will think if you're tyrone Woodley

913
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:39,700
Woodley?
Well,

914
00:38:39,701 --> 00:38:40,420
how about Bruce?

915
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,440
Buffer.
Fucking it up.

916
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:44,650
Where what was going on that decision 
was because you were like,

917
00:38:44,651 --> 00:38:45,640
Whoa,
everyone chill,

918
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,230
chill.
Well,

919
00:38:47,231 --> 00:38:48,550
here's what was going on.
First of all,

920
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:52,410
Bruce said it wrong.
He was not a majority decision.

921
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,010
It was a majority draw.
Correct.

922
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:55,750
But they probably wrote it down wrong 
for them.

923
00:38:55,930 --> 00:39:00,930
The New York does not do any MMA.
They've never done that in May before 

924
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:02,020
the first event.
Never shod shot.

925
00:39:02,021 --> 00:39:02,830
Yeah,
exactly.

926
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:08,300
Um,
so they do this thing where they tally 

927
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:11,311
up the scorecards,
they give it to bruce and I guess it 

928
00:39:11,311 --> 00:39:11,311
said majority decision.
Tyron Woodley,

929
00:39:11,311 --> 00:39:15,991
they read to judges quarter to draw one.
Judge scores it for Woodley and Woodley 

930
00:39:15,991 --> 00:39:18,040
retains the title,
but it's supposed to be majority draw.

931
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:23,070
Yes.
That's what the majority of the people 

932
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:23,070
thought it was a draw.
So it's a majority draw.

933
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:24,310
So Bruce said it wrong whether they gave
it to them wrong,

934
00:39:24,311 --> 00:39:24,740
I don't know.

935
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:27,040
And Real Steve Harvey moment.
Yes.

936
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:29,830
And then they and then tire and freaked 
out.

937
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,070
And then the audience booed.
The audience went crazy and I said,

938
00:39:33,071 --> 00:39:34,720
do you still have your title?
Just hold.

939
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,970
And I was,
and they wanted bruce to say it again.

940
00:39:36,971 --> 00:39:41,971
So Bruce says it again.
I was going to say it again onto the 

941
00:39:41,971 --> 00:39:41,971
microphone,
but they're like,

942
00:39:41,971 --> 00:39:42,580
insisted he get the mic and he says it 
again.

943
00:39:42,581 --> 00:39:47,581
So he says it again and he.
Because he wanted to correct the 

944
00:39:47,581 --> 00:39:50,641
mistake.
So he says it again and then I have to 

945
00:39:50,641 --> 00:39:50,641
say that the audience is booing.
I'm like,

946
00:39:50,641 --> 00:39:51,400
this is the exact same score.
Yes,

947
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,920
it's the exact same score.
It's just a wrong definition.

948
00:39:53,921 --> 00:39:54,830
Just read,
run yet.

949
00:39:54,831 --> 00:39:59,831
That's all.
And I think it was probably pretty 

950
00:39:59,831 --> 00:39:59,831
accurate too.
I think it was right before it.

951
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:03,350
I think maybe with 10 seconds left,
I look at Brian and I went,

952
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:04,480
I bet you anything.

953
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,520
It's crazy.
And I even tweeted out before this,

954
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:09,730
I think it's a draw triangles,
no championship math.

955
00:40:09,731 --> 00:40:11,050
I go,
I feel like it's a draw I give.

956
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:16,260
I give that a 10,
eight and then I scored the other 

957
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:16,260
rounds.
I forget what scoring.

958
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:20,430
I think it's a draw.
Some people didn't give Woodley eight 

959
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:23,270
for the fourth insane because at the end
of the round wondered where it was on 

960
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:24,190
top of him punching him.
That's insane.

961
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:25,980
Yeah,
but I say bully beat death,

962
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:28,570
anything.
If he didn't do that,

963
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:33,690
if,
if I'm wonder wonderboy didn't get out 

964
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:33,690
and wasn't on top,
it might be at 10,

965
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:37,780
seven,
because not only did he hurt him with 

966
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:38,410
big punches then he almost choked the 
life out of them.

967
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:43,650
I mean he had them in a deep getting and
people were telling me that wasn't a 

968
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:45,520
good team.
Like out of your fucking mind.

969
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:47,310
You're insane.
Have a guy,

970
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:52,360
a guy as strong as Woodley May.
Let's say his position is a little off 

971
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,070
to the side.
Just for the record.

972
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:54,390
And what round is it?
Lauren?

973
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,870
Was that third round?
Third round.

974
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:59,140
So your cardio running fourth round.
Fourth Round.

975
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:04,290
You already exhausted and you have that 
hundred 70 pound monster around your 

976
00:41:04,301 --> 00:41:06,040
neck.
He's not one 70 now.

977
00:41:06,041 --> 00:41:07,180
He's every bit of what?
Pr?

978
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:08,680
200.
Probably 200 pounds.

979
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:10,600
And by the way,
he's a brown belt.

980
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:13,600
He's a brown belt in Jujitsu.
You think tyron woodley does not a choke

981
00:41:13,601 --> 00:41:14,620
people.
You're fucking crazy.

982
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:17,690
It was a very good choke and I.
I was amazed.

983
00:41:17,691 --> 00:41:18,150
He too.
Men,

984
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:23,210
I think I was thinking was like 
wonderful as that skinny ass net and 

985
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:26,311
tiny head,
smaller head than me and a small head 

986
00:41:26,311 --> 00:41:27,850
things that woody said.
Woody said,

987
00:41:27,851 --> 00:41:30,520
well,
I knew he had a little head did.

988
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:31,720
He was like,
Oh shit.

989
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:34,340
I didn't even think about his head.
I was about the size of his neck.

990
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:38,060
He has a slender neck yet tiny head.
Isn't it amazing?

991
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:42,480
The human body can take that like nodded
his head and not rip off his neck.

992
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,420
Not Break.
That's what I'm saying.

993
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:49,440
We'll leave broken neck.
I guarantee you if you had that in the 

994
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:49,640
first round,
he probably would have been able to.

995
00:41:49,641 --> 00:41:51,470
I agree,
but how tough is it?

996
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,280
Well,
yeah,

997
00:41:52,281 --> 00:41:55,160
I see what you're saying.
It have been a different story.

998
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:57,950
How tough is wonderboy though?
Ridiculous and I've,

999
00:41:58,010 --> 00:42:00,320
and this is an I know wonderboy st 
manager.

1000
00:42:00,321 --> 00:42:02,870
We've trained together.
Bunch love the guy.

1001
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:04,490
I've always,
and this is just me,

1002
00:42:04,491 --> 00:42:09,491
I've always questioned his toughness 
because he does come from a privileged 

1003
00:42:09,491 --> 00:42:13,721
family,
like they have this huge Taekwondo 

1004
00:42:13,721 --> 00:42:13,721
Academy,
South Carolina,

1005
00:42:13,721 --> 00:42:14,180
and he has a great home life and his 
dad's,

1006
00:42:14,181 --> 00:42:17,360
his coach and his brothers are studs 
Quando or just karate.

1007
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,070
I'm not sure.

1008
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:21,360
Just karate.
Karate style.

1009
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,640
Yeah,
you're probably right.

1010
00:42:22,641 --> 00:42:23,340
One of those.
So.

1011
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:24,920
But he had this huge school,
you know what I'm saying?

1012
00:42:24,921 --> 00:42:29,921
Very successful.
Been to dinners with his dad and the 

1013
00:42:29,921 --> 00:42:29,921
whole family.
God,

1014
00:42:29,921 --> 00:42:31,880
this guy has everything going for him.
So when I see that's like,

1015
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,890
you know,
it's the Calabasas kids thing,

1016
00:42:33,891 --> 00:42:38,891
like you've never seen the tufts can 
tell bass isn't gonna do shit in the 

1017
00:42:38,891 --> 00:42:41,321
UFC.
It's just that when they're privileged 

1018
00:42:41,321 --> 00:42:41,321
like that.
So when the going gets rough,

1019
00:42:41,321 --> 00:42:44,801
I've always kind of questioned wonderboy
and I've never seen it though because 

1020
00:42:44,801 --> 00:42:44,801
the Matt Brown fight,
you know,

1021
00:42:44,801 --> 00:42:47,190
his last loss and it was back and forth.
There's a scrap.

1022
00:42:47,191 --> 00:42:47,630
I'm like,
all right,

1023
00:42:47,631 --> 00:42:49,670
whatever this fight man.
I was,

1024
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:53,420
I was watching with fans.
I was standing up clapping like,

1025
00:42:53,421 --> 00:42:55,430
what is going on right now?
Man,

1026
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:58,900
what the fuck you talking about?
It was crazy fight and uh,

1027
00:42:58,990 --> 00:42:59,900
there's a lot interesting.

1028
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:02,570
First of all,
how fucking hard is Tyron Woodley head?

1029
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:06,740
Jesus Christ God who he has one of the 
best trait,

1030
00:43:06,741 --> 00:43:09,020
right?
Hands in the business and fit lands.

1031
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:10,970
I can't believe one avoiding getting 
knocked out.

1032
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:12,050
Unbelievable.
Well,

1033
00:43:12,051 --> 00:43:14,390
I mean he's a guy who fought and 
professional kickboxing.

1034
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:19,690
He has a 57 and oh,
combined kickbox and record amateur and 

1035
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:22,991
pro.
I guarantee he didn't fight anyone that 

1036
00:43:22,991 --> 00:43:23,780
kickbox and circled that punches his 
hardest and not with four ounce gloves.

1037
00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:24,610
Yeah,
exactly.

1038
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:29,710
The other big,
he can punch faster with those little 

1039
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:29,940
gloves on and it hurts more wetlands.
So let.

1040
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:34,990
So let's say Dana does do the rematch.
They don't do conor Woodley and they do 

1041
00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:35,360
do the rematch.
I was thinking about it.

1042
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,520
Three titles,
three titles,

1043
00:43:37,521 --> 00:43:38,660
but focus me third.

1044
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:45,680
But a woodley was a slight underdog.
And if you listen to Duke Roufus who was

1045
00:43:45,681 --> 00:43:47,180
talking about their game plan,
you,

1046
00:43:47,181 --> 00:43:49,850
I think you're starting on the post 
fight press conference.

1047
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:51,080
Third Game Plan.
Why?

1048
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:52,220
And you even mentioned it.
You're like,

1049
00:43:52,221 --> 00:43:55,530
I don't get why tyrone is against the 
cage and I didn't like it either.

1050
00:43:55,531 --> 00:43:56,180
I'm like,
what's he doing?

1051
00:43:56,181 --> 00:43:58,810
He's get murdered.
That was their game plan because what do

1052
00:43:58,820 --> 00:43:59,750
you know?
He does that a lot.

1053
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:00,950
Yes,
he does that a lot.

1054
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:04,520
And then wonder boys a counter striker.
So they wanted to bring him to Woodley.

1055
00:44:04,521 --> 00:44:09,521
That was their thinking by him being 
against the cage and do all that and 

1056
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:09,521
then get him to commit to take them 
down.

1057
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:13,130
So they kind of,
it surprised wonderboy a little bit,

1058
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:18,580
but in the rematch I think it favors 
wonderboy so much more because now he 

1059
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:19,340
knows Woodley's going to fight like 
that.

1060
00:44:19,341 --> 00:44:21,410
He might not fight like that.
You might not find like that.

1061
00:44:21,411 --> 00:44:22,870
So then he.
So,

1062
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:27,010
and this is my thing here.
I think the ability to change and,

1063
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:32,030
and,
and be more dynamic in wonder boys 

1064
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:32,160
favorite his,
you know what I'm saying

1065
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,080
in a way.
But here's the thing.

1066
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:37,320
Woodley only took him down once in the 
whole fight and mauled him.

1067
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:40,260
Once he got onto the ground,
which is avoiding tee off,

1068
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:45,290
what if one would,
if Woodley decides to do that every 

1069
00:44:45,290 --> 00:44:45,290
fucking round,
you know,

1070
00:44:45,290 --> 00:44:48,600
I don't know how much wonderboy can stop
woodley from taking them down.

1071
00:44:48,601 --> 00:44:53,601
Woodley so much bigger,
so much stronger in a way better 

1072
00:44:53,601 --> 00:44:55,881
wrestler.
Woodley takes him down like he took him 

1073
00:44:55,881 --> 00:44:58,221
down to the first round.
I mean that might've been the strategic 

1074
00:44:58,221 --> 00:44:58,730
error because Woodley mauled him in the 
first round.

1075
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:00,900
By the end of the round,
his nose is fucked up.

1076
00:45:00,901 --> 00:45:04,650
He's got a giant caught.
He's leaking blood and Woodley just held

1077
00:45:04,651 --> 00:45:06,300
him down and dominated him on the 
ground.

1078
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:11,480
So if he just does that in the round two
and I mean if he was able to do that 

1079
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:11,760
instead of trying to stay and knock him 
out,

1080
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,890
he might've been able to stop him.

1081
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:19,130
Correct.
But the reason why he got that takedown 

1082
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:21,040
is based off those kicks.
And then one boy stopped kicking as like

1083
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:23,250
he wasn't looking for the knockout.
Does that make sense?

1084
00:45:23,251 --> 00:45:25,860
Like he was so hesitant after that.
So.

1085
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:28,770
And I feel like the reason he got that 
was it because of the kick.

1086
00:45:28,771 --> 00:45:33,650
So I think wonderboy can make changes 
more of changes to win the next flight.

1087
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,410
Maybe who knows,
but I'm saying as far as game plan wise,

1088
00:45:37,411 --> 00:45:39,090
I think it favors wonderboy.
Yeah.

1089
00:45:39,091 --> 00:45:44,091
But here's the thing,
now that tyron knows like wonder boys 

1090
00:45:44,091 --> 00:45:46,630
timing and he's be able to rock them.
He's gonna have some serious confidence 

1091
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:50,391
in launching that right hand.
But go ahead and move forward on one 

1092
00:45:50,391 --> 00:45:50,391
voice.
See what happens.

1093
00:45:50,391 --> 00:45:51,210
Yeah.
But sometimes it works.

1094
00:45:51,211 --> 00:45:56,211
I mean he's been able to take them down.
Other people being able to take them 

1095
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:57,570
down and when he gets them down,
like the difference in the grappling was

1096
00:45:57,571 --> 00:46:00,730
pretty fucking evident to me look like a
white belt versus you know,

1097
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:02,550
just so much stronger.

1098
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:04,130
It's so much better at holding them in 
place.

1099
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:04,830
I was like,
man,

1100
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:07,850
if this fight goes this way,
Woodley's going to run away with.

1101
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:10,200
It was what I thought I thought to me,
to me,

1102
00:46:10,201 --> 00:46:11,490
busted them open.
Bad,

1103
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:16,520
bad man.
And then when you're dealing with 

1104
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:19,401
wonderboy,
you're dealing with that weird sideways 

1105
00:46:19,401 --> 00:46:19,950
stance.
And just popping that jab and his face,

1106
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:21,630
hands down,
hands down.

1107
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:24,380
He's a weird guy to spar with.
The other thing is one boy,

1108
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:27,480
he didn't let his hands go at all at 
all.

1109
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:31,000
That lefthand and like,
he's so good going south.

1110
00:46:31,001 --> 00:46:32,610
Paul traditionally can go back and 
forth,

1111
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,970
but it was all kicks for him.
Well he,

1112
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:38,100
I think he was worried after that 
takedown and getting busted up,

1113
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:39,190
have,
you know,

1114
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:40,830
opening up,
getting taken down again.

1115
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:45,980
But you know,
tyron is a totally different animal to 

1116
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:45,980
is a different animal than Johnny 
Hendricks.

1117
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:45,980
Like great.
Johnny.

1118
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:51,130
Yeah.
And the Johnny Hendricks that wonderboy 

1119
00:46:51,130 --> 00:46:51,130
faced.
Let's be honest,

1120
00:46:51,130 --> 00:46:51,820
he's not the same guy.
Not even close.

1121
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:52,980
He just not know.
I don't know.

1122
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:55,220
He's not the same guy that knocked out 
John Fitch.

1123
00:46:55,221 --> 00:46:57,060
He's not the same guy that knocked out 
Martin Kampmann.

1124
00:46:57,090 --> 00:46:58,240
He's just not the same guy.
No,

1125
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:03,320
just not know for whatever reason.
Speculate all you want Internet for 

1126
00:47:03,331 --> 00:47:05,190
whatever reason.
I mean maybe it's motivation.

1127
00:47:05,191 --> 00:47:07,500
Maybe it's a personal problem.
Camps,

1128
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:12,510
who knows?
He opened up a steak restaurant and it 

1129
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:12,510
went out of business.
Terrible idea.

1130
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:15,120
But maybe he just terrible idea.
So to worst of your celebrity,

1131
00:47:15,121 --> 00:47:17,310
you've got some cash.
Maybe the worst idea of restaurants.

1132
00:47:17,311 --> 00:47:20,760
Not The way to gay.
I'm trying to be successful and happy.

1133
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:22,350
I'd rather be stressed out,
broke.

1134
00:47:22,470 --> 00:47:27,470
I hate money.
Do you have a restaurant I can invest 

1135
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:27,470
in?
That's,

1136
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:27,470
I mean,
it's a terrible idea.

1137
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:29,130
Even if they just put his name on it,
he's still associated with that failure.

1138
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,390
I'm sure he had to have some form of 
commitment to it.

1139
00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:36,450
I'm sure you got a sign.
Will people even fucking t-bones for 30 

1140
00:47:36,450 --> 00:47:36,450
percent off or something like that?
The uh,

1141
00:47:36,450 --> 00:47:37,510
the not read it.
Um,

1142
00:47:37,570 --> 00:47:42,570
the uh,
Yahoo and yelp reviews rather they were 

1143
00:47:42,570 --> 00:47:42,570
terribly bad.
Other were the worst.

1144
00:47:42,570 --> 00:47:44,800
It was like one star.
We can be associated with that.

1145
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:48,490
Like if you want to open up a restaurant
and you're a celebrity,

1146
00:47:48,550 --> 00:47:52,550
good luck.
And she'd be a really small place or ubs

1147
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:54,880
or it'd be a silent investor.
Like don't be,

1148
00:47:54,910 --> 00:47:56,170
don't be the face of it.
Well,

1149
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:58,360
there's a bunch of places like that in 
La.

1150
00:47:58,360 --> 00:47:58,950
One hundred percent.
Yeah.

1151
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:00,580
Like,
uh,

1152
00:48:01,090 --> 00:48:02,220
Travis Barker.
Humans,

1153
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:07,240
a crossroads.
You don't see a mark and stuff like 

1154
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:09,661
that,
but it's like an obviously not your cup 

1155
00:48:09,661 --> 00:48:10,130
of tea,
but all a Vegan restaurant though.

1156
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:13,320
It's like the number one place in La as 
far as Vegan killing it.

1157
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:15,280
Yeah,
but you don't see him blasting out there

1158
00:48:15,281 --> 00:48:18,130
like his face on the front of the 
restaurant rather than playing the drums

1159
00:48:18,131 --> 00:48:19,990
while they're serving up spring rolls.
Well,

1160
00:48:19,991 --> 00:48:22,060
they were calling it the big rig 
steakhouse.

1161
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:24,790
God dammit.
Let some Texas Shit.

1162
00:48:24,850 --> 00:48:25,510
Yeah,
it's texts.

1163
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:27,000
It might work in Texas.
Right.

1164
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:30,220
Big Rig statement if it was on from big 
rig,

1165
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:30,670
whatever.
It was.

1166
00:48:30,671 --> 00:48:32,530
Awesome.
It sounds like though,

1167
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:33,560
is it st?
No,

1168
00:48:33,570 --> 00:48:35,560
it doesn't.
Has that ever worked?

1169
00:48:35,561 --> 00:48:37,330
Well,
I guess you know elway did it.

1170
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:39,430
John Wayne did his elway's steakhouse in
Denver.

1171
00:48:39,431 --> 00:48:42,670
Kills that real defined stake.
Ted Ted has them.

1172
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:44,860
Who's Ted?
Ted Turner.

1173
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:46,300
Oh,
he's got those texts.

1174
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:46,990
Yeah,
true.

1175
00:48:47,210 --> 00:48:49,960
Shanahan's has meat and shit.
Yeah,

1176
00:48:49,990 --> 00:48:51,220
it's a tough Gig,
man.

1177
00:48:51,310 --> 00:48:53,110
Tough.
Rocky did the last one,

1178
00:48:53,111 --> 00:48:57,290
but it's also for an athlete,
especially a fighter where your mind and

1179
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:58,030
you,
first of all,

1180
00:48:58,031 --> 00:49:00,850
you have this event that happens and I 
don't have to tell you this,

1181
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,570
but for everybody listening it happened.

1182
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:05,080
It takes months before the event.
You're thinking about this event.

1183
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:07,450
We're preparing for the event and an 
event is one night.

1184
00:49:08,290 --> 00:49:11,830
Anything that can fuck your head up 
along the way should be avoided.

1185
00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:16,950
Yeah.
You shouldn't be thinking about getting 

1186
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:18,721
mass discounts on t bones and filet.
You should be really worried about 

1187
00:49:18,721 --> 00:49:19,000
wonderful.
Anything.

1188
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:20,980
Anything that could fuck you up.
You know,

1189
00:49:20,981 --> 00:49:23,800
there's so many different things that 
can creep into your mind.

1190
00:49:24,010 --> 00:49:26,110
Will look great.
Transition.

1191
00:49:26,170 --> 00:49:26,930
Look at me.
Tate.

1192
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:32,220
Yeah.
I told him I'm not taking anything away 

1193
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:32,220
from Pennington.
I thought she was brilliant.

1194
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:36,421
She did her job.
I thought there was a real bad matchup 

1195
00:49:36,421 --> 00:49:36,421
for me.
Show,

1196
00:49:36,421 --> 00:49:36,421
honestly.
Super underrated,

1197
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:37,870
but she.
She's underrated for sure.

1198
00:49:37,871 --> 00:49:41,040
I also think that version of me shut.
I and I,

1199
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:45,330
I just said that's Misha doesn't look 
into it or something else is going on.

1200
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:46,630
She said I'm an off night.
She,

1201
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:51,690
it didn't look like the normal meesha 
were used to seeing and for Misha for 

1202
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:52,290
her to say I'm done.
I didn't.

1203
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:57,440
I couldn't hear it because again,
I was watching with a live crowd so I 

1204
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:57,440
can hit,
but she retired.

1205
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:58,540
She retired.
When she say she was just like,

1206
00:49:58,541 --> 00:49:59,530
I'm out.
Yeah.

1207
00:49:59,531 --> 00:50:01,090
She says,
I just want to say I'm done.

1208
00:50:01,150 --> 00:50:02,380
I'm done.
And I said,

1209
00:50:02,381 --> 00:50:04,200
it was this based entirely on your 
performance?

1210
00:50:04,201 --> 00:50:05,860
Is that something you planned?
And she said,

1211
00:50:05,861 --> 00:50:07,480
no,
it was based on my performance.

1212
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:12,840
And then she said that I just,
I've taken a lot of punishment and I'm 

1213
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:15,990
fairman that's fair and she's also to me
she,

1214
00:50:15,991 --> 00:50:18,130
someone you,
you want your daughters to look up to.

1215
00:50:18,131 --> 00:50:23,131
Like she's such a great face for women's
MMA just because obviously she's a 

1216
00:50:23,131 --> 00:50:24,940
beautiful young lady.
Probably the best looking one the UFC,

1217
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:27,100
but she also,
she speaks very well.

1218
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:29,090
She has the skills.
You're talking about a lady who,

1219
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:31,850
if you would've told her she'd been 
champion in the UFC,

1220
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:37,150
you know,
after you've seen our fights with ron 

1221
00:50:37,150 --> 00:50:37,150
and these other fights,
she,

1222
00:50:37,150 --> 00:50:37,150
I'm sure she.
I'm like,

1223
00:50:37,150 --> 00:50:40,961
you're full of shit.
And she just came back from adversity 

1224
00:50:40,961 --> 00:50:41,000
like when she beat Holly.
Amazing,

1225
00:50:41,090 --> 00:50:44,480
amazing man.
And for her now there's so much more for

1226
00:50:44,481 --> 00:50:49,481
her to do this why I'm proud of her and 
her getting out when she did because I 

1227
00:50:49,481 --> 00:50:51,050
don't know if you've heard her breakdown
fights as a female analyst.

1228
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:54,680
She is so damn good.
It's ridiculous.

1229
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:56,270
She's very smart.
She's very smart.

1230
00:50:56,271 --> 00:51:01,271
She's very good at breaking down the 
fights as far as not like Joe Rogan 

1231
00:51:01,271 --> 00:51:01,271
style.
Uh,

1232
00:51:01,271 --> 00:51:02,780
Brian Stann style dump.
Krista.

1233
00:51:02,870 --> 00:51:07,870
She's good as a,
as an analyst on when she's up there 

1234
00:51:07,870 --> 00:51:08,750
with like Stan and business and those 
guys.

1235
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:11,120
And have you had on your show?
We have not had another show.

1236
00:51:11,130 --> 00:51:13,070
I listened to her on your show and I 
thought she was brilliant.

1237
00:51:13,071 --> 00:51:14,500
She's got her own show now too.
Does she?

1238
00:51:14,510 --> 00:51:15,850
Has she has her own podcast?
Yeah.

1239
00:51:15,890 --> 00:51:17,240
Well she's already doing it the right 
way.

1240
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:18,570
But um,
I,

1241
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:21,110
I think for her man,
like sky's the limit.

1242
00:51:21,170 --> 00:51:22,190
I really do.
You're right.

1243
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:24,410
I think you're right.
And I think if she really mean,

1244
00:51:24,411 --> 00:51:26,480
everybody always says that if you have 
one foot out the door,

1245
00:51:26,510 --> 00:51:28,520
you should just walk,
just go there.

1246
00:51:28,521 --> 00:51:31,580
You go here.
And that's why he sent me down here.

1247
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:36,910
Well excuse me sir.
You're telling Dick Jokes and trying to 

1248
00:51:36,910 --> 00:51:36,910
fight right now.
What's one thing?

1249
00:51:36,910 --> 00:51:39,440
Watching somebody who you don't love 
who's just like,

1250
00:51:39,441 --> 00:51:41,360
well you know,
or even you do love,

1251
00:51:41,361 --> 00:51:42,890
you don't have that close of a 
relationship with.

1252
00:51:42,890 --> 00:51:45,170
But as a friend,
you know,

1253
00:51:45,171 --> 00:51:46,880
you have a close friendship with 
someone.

1254
00:51:46,881 --> 00:51:49,880
You see the path.
I mean it's one of those things,

1255
00:51:49,881 --> 00:51:51,620
man,
you see it time and time again.

1256
00:51:51,810 --> 00:51:54,230
I,
I can name you 100 guys that I know that

1257
00:51:54,231 --> 00:51:55,820
are kind of half in the game.
Oh yeah.

1258
00:51:56,060 --> 00:52:01,060
And they still do it in every now and 
then they get knocked out or they'll 

1259
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:01,160
fight some Yair,
Rodriguez type motherfucker.

1260
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:05,000
Some upcoming lit up and all in.
Yeah.

1261
00:52:05,001 --> 00:52:07,190
Those all in guys are fucking scary.
Yeah.

1262
00:52:07,310 --> 00:52:12,310
And you know,
for me it was the best thing that ever 

1263
00:52:12,310 --> 00:52:12,310
happened in my life.
So.

1264
00:52:12,310 --> 00:52:15,100
Well,
I think it's probably going to be the 

1265
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:15,100
best thing for me should too,
and one of the things that I said to me,

1266
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:15,100
she was like,
you know,

1267
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:17,420
you've already achieved the highest 
achievement ever in mma.

1268
00:52:17,421 --> 00:52:19,160
You were world champion in the UFC.

1269
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:21,590
So like you know that no one could ever 
take that from her.

1270
00:52:21,591 --> 00:52:25,190
She wanted it in spectacular fashion and
it was an amazing accomplishment.

1271
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,320
That's a giant thing to have on your 
resume.

1272
00:52:27,321 --> 00:52:30,650
Former world champion and she's at the 
perfect time.

1273
00:52:30,651 --> 00:52:34,020
Just talking about from a business side 
of things is the,

1274
00:52:34,110 --> 00:52:37,040
the UFC contract with Fox is,
is coming up.

1275
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:42,100
So what they're going to do from my 
understanding is it's going to be on 

1276
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:46,541
multiple networks,
so it's going to be like the NFL or Mba 

1277
00:52:46,541 --> 00:52:48,920
or whatever these other sports leagues 
with just tied to Fox,

1278
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:51,860
which opens up the door for espn,
CBS,

1279
00:52:51,890 --> 00:52:56,890
all these other networks.
So that opens up the door for all these 

1280
00:52:56,890 --> 00:52:57,630
other shows for her.
So if I,

1281
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:01,070
if I'm a Misha tate,
I don't sign with Fox right now.

1282
00:53:01,630 --> 00:53:03,650
She's the best female analyst in the 
game to me.

1283
00:53:03,950 --> 00:53:08,950
I think she waits to that deal,
goes and then fields all the offers and 

1284
00:53:08,950 --> 00:53:12,621
she has the time to do it.
She might or UFC might offer some sort 

1285
00:53:12,621 --> 00:53:12,621
of an in house Gig,
you know,

1286
00:53:12,621 --> 00:53:13,890
who knows?
I could see that saying,

1287
00:53:14,030 --> 00:53:15,330
don't do that,
don't do that man.

1288
00:53:15,331 --> 00:53:20,331
The farmer manager don't do that.
Let them play the negotiating game and 

1289
00:53:20,331 --> 00:53:23,471
she has so many talents and no one's 
coming along like crew who speaks or it 

1290
00:53:23,471 --> 00:53:23,471
looks like her.
Yeah.

1291
00:53:23,471 --> 00:53:25,620
It wasn't that happening with you guys.
Isn't there a network issue?

1292
00:53:25,770 --> 00:53:30,770
Yes.
There is some sort of an issue with you 

1293
00:53:30,770 --> 00:53:32,961
guys being on Fox for,
for us it's just a brag.

1294
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:35,820
Don't talk about that.
A Rogan and we before.

1295
00:53:35,821 --> 00:53:40,821
I'm like,
we got to talk about it and you don't 

1296
00:53:40,821 --> 00:53:40,821
mean I'm an open book and I'm like,
do what?

1297
00:53:40,821 --> 00:53:42,120
You don't have to talk about it if you 
don't want to know.

1298
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:45,370
I know we always talk about,
for me it's just a um,

1299
00:53:46,170 --> 00:53:46,920
you know,
I'm always,

1300
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:52,580
I'm always in the understanding of we 
don't need anybody and you've always 

1301
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:55,060
said that and I think uh,
the fire and the kid fan base and,

1302
00:53:55,061 --> 00:53:58,770
and what we've achieved has literally 
nothing to do with Fox,

1303
00:53:58,830 --> 00:54:00,150
you know,
they gave us a studio and I,

1304
00:54:00,151 --> 00:54:02,190
and,
and I'm grateful for that stuff,

1305
00:54:02,191 --> 00:54:04,410
but we would be here with or without 
them,

1306
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:06,420
you know,
studios not that big a deal.

1307
00:54:06,421 --> 00:54:08,850
You just want to rent office space.
A lot of guys,

1308
00:54:08,851 --> 00:54:11,880
we all know people that do it.
Tom and Christina do it.

1309
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:13,800
Joey Diaz does it.
I do.

1310
00:54:13,810 --> 00:54:15,570
A lot of people do it.
They just rent space,

1311
00:54:15,630 --> 00:54:16,620
correct.
Not Hard to do.

1312
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:17,760
No.
And you know,

1313
00:54:17,790 --> 00:54:19,780
we,
our biggest issue would be finding a,

1314
00:54:20,070 --> 00:54:25,070
a good producer to help us,
like a young Jamie you would have to do 

1315
00:54:25,070 --> 00:54:27,090
is put out the ad,
throw the bat signal up online.

1316
00:54:27,090 --> 00:54:32,090
I'm sure this,
here's the best signal signal we're 

1317
00:54:32,090 --> 00:54:33,020
looking for one.
Yeah.

1318
00:54:33,030 --> 00:54:38,030
I mean,
if you find someone who knows how to 

1319
00:54:38,030 --> 00:54:38,460
handle the internet side of things and 
I'm sure Jamie can help them,

1320
00:54:39,030 --> 00:54:40,920
what's going on today?
That's really interesting,

1321
00:54:40,921 --> 00:54:45,921
and podcasting,
and we've kind of talked about this 

1322
00:54:45,921 --> 00:54:47,661
before,
but is that the real network is the 

1323
00:54:47,661 --> 00:54:48,750
organic network between friends?
Correct.

1324
00:54:48,751 --> 00:54:53,751
It's between all of us.
Between Joey and bill burr and Bert 

1325
00:54:53,751 --> 00:54:56,040
Kreischer and Thompson.
We're all just a bunch of friends and we

1326
00:54:56,041 --> 00:55:01,041
talk about each other and we have each 
other on and everybody finds out about 

1327
00:55:01,041 --> 00:55:03,810
each other from each other and we 
retweet each other and re instagram each

1328
00:55:03,811 --> 00:55:07,860
other and support each other and that's 
not like a real network where there's no

1329
00:55:09,150 --> 00:55:12,090
deals going on.
There's no paper signed.

1330
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:14,460
It's an and then everybody sort of 
benefiting from it.

1331
00:55:14,490 --> 00:55:16,770
Equally,
everybody gets something out of it,

1332
00:55:16,771 --> 00:55:18,390
you know?
That's a real network.

1333
00:55:18,391 --> 00:55:23,391
This other thing is a weird business.
We're noncreative people capitalize on 

1334
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:25,660
the work of creative people and they 
provide you with what?

1335
00:55:25,661 --> 00:55:29,250
A fucking series of walls and an 
Internet connection.

1336
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,540
Oh,
thank you for that.

1337
00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:33,570
You definitely should get half the money
out of your fucking mind.

1338
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:35,340
That's exactly what I said.
I,

1339
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:37,280
it,
it's just a different age now that,

1340
00:55:37,290 --> 00:55:38,460
that,
that we're going into.

1341
00:55:38,461 --> 00:55:40,010
And um,
it's,

1342
00:55:40,110 --> 00:55:41,730
we're in a good spot.
That's a good thing.

1343
00:55:41,731 --> 00:55:46,731
We're in a good spot and we have offers 
from all these other networks and stuff 

1344
00:55:46,731 --> 00:55:48,000
like that.
So that's all good in the hood.

1345
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:53,060
The most important thing is just you 
guys love what you do and the show is 

1346
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:54,120
fun and that's the biggest thing and 
then people are going to still enjoy it.

1347
00:55:54,121 --> 00:55:56,550
So it's almost like,
think about it as little as you can.

1348
00:55:56,550 --> 00:56:00,240
I guess for me,
I see it as a opportunity.

1349
00:56:00,270 --> 00:56:02,520
Like when,
when we were discussing it today,

1350
00:56:02,610 --> 00:56:04,110
I was excited.
I'm like,

1351
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:07,280
Oh yes,
you kind of get our Joe Rogan now,

1352
00:56:07,390 --> 00:56:09,030
Jack,
you got to do that for sure.

1353
00:56:09,130 --> 00:56:10,390
A lot of guys have done.
Then you know,

1354
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:12,480
my friend Dave Rubin,
who was on last week,

1355
00:56:12,510 --> 00:56:14,700
he had a similar situation.
He was with one network.

1356
00:56:14,701 --> 00:56:16,620
He left that and went with another 
network and he was like,

1357
00:56:16,621 --> 00:56:19,020
what the fuck am I doing?
And I told him,

1358
00:56:19,021 --> 00:56:20,920
I'm like to just keep,
just be free.

1359
00:56:20,921 --> 00:56:22,110
You just get out there.
Well,

1360
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:24,010
I think what people don't is like all

1361
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:25,690
the guests,
the marketing,

1362
00:56:25,691 --> 00:56:28,810
the merchandise,
like I have five hired our own booker.

1363
00:56:28,870 --> 00:56:31,210
We found our own published.
Like it's all in house.

1364
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:36,240
It's all whatever I want to do with it.
Like we literally just show up to the 

1365
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:39,931
studio.
I can't imagine how they thought that 

1366
00:56:39,931 --> 00:56:39,931
they'd get 50 percent of that.
It's so crazy.

1367
00:56:39,931 --> 00:56:42,220
It's insane.
It's just maybe they just don't know how

1368
00:56:42,221 --> 00:56:44,950
much money it is or they don't.
I was literally laughing,

1369
00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:46,690
like physically laughing,
like,

1370
00:56:46,691 --> 00:56:48,250
oh,
you have to resolve it.

1371
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:51,630
How'd you end it?
Now it's off to the agents call agent.

1372
00:56:51,631 --> 00:56:52,460
Like there you go,
man.

1373
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:55,660
I should have never brought you in the 
first place at all.

1374
00:56:55,661 --> 00:57:00,661
That stuff's supposed to be done with 
agents and that's supposed to bring you 

1375
00:57:00,661 --> 00:57:00,940
in and talk financials with you with no 
representation.

1376
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:02,530
Correct.
However,

1377
00:57:02,590 --> 00:57:05,650
I'm very,
and if to almost to a fault,

1378
00:57:05,651 --> 00:57:09,100
I'm very in on as far as the business 
side.

1379
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:11,890
Things go with fighter and the kid like,
I want to be involved now.

1380
00:57:12,130 --> 00:57:13,390
Now when it goes to negotiate,
uh,

1381
00:57:13,391 --> 00:57:18,391
you guys do that,
if you want to change the logo from a 

1382
00:57:18,391 --> 00:57:20,710
maroon to an orange,
you better fucking go over it with me.

1383
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:23,410
If you do some without me knowing that,
then we have issues.

1384
00:57:23,470 --> 00:57:25,030
Do they think they can do that kind of 
shit though?

1385
00:57:25,031 --> 00:57:27,880
Do you think that they would start doing
that if they did it once and I was like,

1386
00:57:27,881 --> 00:57:29,320
well what did they do?
They,

1387
00:57:29,321 --> 00:57:31,600
uh,
they changed something if some logo,

1388
00:57:31,601 --> 00:57:34,540
they tweeted something out that I didn't
approve and you know,

1389
00:57:34,541 --> 00:57:36,220
you can call me a control freak,
but.

1390
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:38,090
So this is like the network did that.
Fox.

1391
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:38,800
Yeah.
Yeah.

1392
00:57:38,801 --> 00:57:40,840
Well they have certain people run the,
the,

1393
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:42,100
the accounts,
you know.

1394
00:57:42,101 --> 00:57:44,040
So they just decided that they were 
like,

1395
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:45,100
uh,
what are you doing?

1396
00:57:45,550 --> 00:57:46,600
You know what I'm saying?
So,

1397
00:57:46,690 --> 00:57:48,400
well that's,
you're in a weird gray area,

1398
00:57:48,490 --> 00:57:49,810
you know,
you have your own show.

1399
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:53,410
You have a very limited amount of people
that are in charge of that show,

1400
00:57:53,620 --> 00:57:57,070
but all these other people that are sort
of used to like if they have a show,

1401
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,800
they get a say they.
I mean I remember when they were telling

1402
00:57:59,801 --> 00:58:01,030
you not to swear.
Yeah.

1403
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:03,740
Other than that they sent you is for you
guys to go get free money.

1404
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:06,060
You've been saying that forever.
No swearing.

1405
00:58:06,370 --> 00:58:07,420
I know,
I know.

1406
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:10,180
It makes it.
Makes the audience like almost you think

1407
00:58:10,181 --> 00:58:12,430
they're stupid or they can't handle the 
swear words.

1408
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:15,160
People were getting upset.
It takes away everything.

1409
00:58:15,161 --> 00:58:20,161
That's great about the Internet.
What's great about the Internet is you 

1410
00:58:20,161 --> 00:58:20,161
just.
You can be yourself.

1411
00:58:20,161 --> 00:58:20,810
You got to be.
You be yourself in.

1412
00:58:20,811 --> 00:58:23,400
But also what they don't realize any.

1413
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:24,970
Again,
it's just an old school way of thinking.

1414
00:58:24,971 --> 00:58:29,971
They don't realize how big podcasting is
getting because whether I'm at Fox,

1415
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:32,710
I'm in Joe Rogan's bathroom doing the 
podcast.

1416
00:58:32,711 --> 00:58:34,720
The listeners just want the audio,
you know?

1417
00:58:34,721 --> 00:58:36,310
They just want the show.
They don't do it.

1418
00:58:36,311 --> 00:58:39,310
Fucking do it.
I got a little microphone that I hook up

1419
00:58:39,311 --> 00:58:41,040
to this fucking thing.
To my bill.

1420
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:41,930
Burn does,
Dude.

1421
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:47,040
It's amazed.
Just goes off his iphone like a maniac 

1422
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:47,040
and it still works.
Mark.

1423
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:48,460
Man,
does that have a garage for God's sakes?

1424
00:58:48,461 --> 00:58:50,230
That's a president in his garage.
Well,

1425
00:58:50,231 --> 00:58:51,990
he's actually got a pretty sweet setup.
No,

1426
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,290
he really does.
But you get the point.

1427
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:55,090
I'm gonna.
Try to find this shit in here.

1428
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:56,940
I'll show you what this thing is.
Yeah,

1429
00:58:56,950 --> 00:59:01,950
it's just,
it's just a different kind of day and 

1430
00:59:01,950 --> 00:59:02,110
age of media and we're in a good spot,
man,

1431
00:59:02,111 --> 00:59:05,800
so I'm happy to.
I just don't think that this.

1432
00:59:06,370 --> 00:59:07,490
I'll find it later,
but it wasn't meant.

1433
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:12,510
Gets a microphone talking about fits 
into here and it has a built in little 

1434
00:59:12,510 --> 00:59:15,130
tripod on it because I think it's called
an apogee or something like that here.

1435
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:17,310
You ever used the zoom mic?
Yeah,

1436
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:18,950
Brian.
I start a zoo.

1437
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:20,730
Mike in his garage.
Yeah.

1438
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:26,300
It's just you don't need much.
You don't need much.

1439
00:59:26,301 --> 00:59:31,301
I mean we're trying.
Obviously we're trying to go the 

1440
00:59:31,301 --> 00:59:33,670
fricking jre experience and then Jamie 
told me how much that God damn mother 

1441
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:35,690
ship board is over them.
We'll probably,

1442
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:38,100
I'll probably see if I can get that at a
goodwill or something like that.

1443
00:59:38,101 --> 00:59:39,470
Sweat this,
this whole thing,

1444
00:59:39,471 --> 00:59:40,250
right?
Like this.

1445
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:43,010
See this all Jeremy,
this all microphone.

1446
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:45,560
I take this to the microphone.
I screwed into here.

1447
00:59:45,561 --> 00:59:47,800
This little baby here is a little 
fucking tripod.

1448
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:49,700
Sits on it.
All kinds of little case.

1449
00:59:50,330 --> 00:59:53,300
I popped that sucker down.
He could set it up in a hotel room.

1450
00:59:53,301 --> 00:59:55,130
Damn son.
That's what you did on the plane when we

1451
00:59:55,140 --> 00:59:57,800
were Dana and Tony know they'll on a 
plane with Deana and Tony.

1452
00:59:57,801 --> 00:59:59,220
I didn't even have this yet.
Damn.

1453
00:59:59,230 --> 01:00:00,500
Of things.
Dope Dude.

1454
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:01,460
It's the shit.

1455
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:02,570
Wow.
Tightened it down.

1456
01:00:02,571 --> 01:00:05,210
What's it called?
It's called the apogee or something like

1457
01:00:05,211 --> 01:00:10,211
that.
I set that up and it's a real live 

1458
01:00:10,211 --> 01:00:10,211
condenser microphone and it picks up all
the voices.

1459
01:00:10,211 --> 01:00:11,110
Claire through your phone.
That's.

1460
01:00:11,330 --> 01:00:13,800
That's really incredible.
That's really cool.

1461
01:00:13,930 --> 01:00:16,250
You need like,
you don't need all this other shit.

1462
01:00:16,670 --> 01:00:18,680
We do all this other shit because even 
way,

1463
01:00:18,681 --> 01:00:19,670
way,
way back in the day.

1464
01:00:19,671 --> 01:00:22,070
I was like,
why wouldn't we have a visual element of

1465
01:00:22,071 --> 01:00:23,880
it?
Why wouldn't we have like a.

1466
01:00:23,990 --> 01:00:28,990
We were doing the streaming version of 
it even even actually before we were 

1467
01:00:28,990 --> 01:00:28,990
doing anything else.
Visuals,

1468
01:00:28,990 --> 01:00:33,970
big donor or youtube,
you need the visual aspect of it for 

1469
01:00:33,970 --> 01:00:34,770
sure.
Like you can't downgrade now but,

1470
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:38,150
but also for us it's just um,
yeah,

1471
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:43,260
you just want to continually,
continually get better key park in baby.

1472
01:00:44,510 --> 01:00:46,430
I can't believe they didn't fire us.

1473
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:49,730
I have to set some outlandish shit on 
that show.

1474
01:00:49,910 --> 01:00:51,170
I can't believe fluxing like,
listen,

1475
01:00:51,171 --> 01:00:52,820
why don't we just can't have it?
Well,

1476
01:00:52,830 --> 01:00:54,290
I don't think they pay attention or 
yeah,

1477
01:00:54,291 --> 01:00:55,800
they know the numbers so they know the 
numbers.

1478
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:58,070
That's one thing they do know because 
you're on their network.

1479
01:00:58,100 --> 01:01:02,090
So the Lord Jesus is because there's not
another thing that they have,

1480
01:01:02,590 --> 01:01:04,910
especially kind of down.
There was a time there when I,

1481
01:01:05,390 --> 01:01:07,820
especially right when I retired and I 
was like,

1482
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:09,650
you know,
I was angry.

1483
01:01:09,651 --> 01:01:12,800
I was angry at certain things may not 
lash out on the mic and stuff like that.

1484
01:01:12,801 --> 01:01:15,050
Especially in their office,
in cahoots with the UFC.

1485
01:01:15,051 --> 01:01:17,420
So how they didn't fire me,
I have no idea.

1486
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:22,960
Well,
I think the worst thing could be that 

1487
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:22,960
they did fire you.
It's actually smart.

1488
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:24,740
They didn't because you know what the 
streisand effect is.

1489
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:27,140
Yeah.
Like when you see now band me and I went

1490
01:01:27,170 --> 01:01:30,180
howling like a little owl to everybody.
You know,

1491
01:01:30,181 --> 01:01:35,181
there's,
there's a bunch of examples of things 

1492
01:01:35,181 --> 01:01:36,881
like that that have happened where 
someone gets bigger because like Milo 

1493
01:01:36,881 --> 01:01:36,881
Yiannopoulos,
you know,

1494
01:01:36,881 --> 01:01:36,881
he is.
Yeah.

1495
01:01:36,881 --> 01:01:41,740
He got banned from twitter,
banned from twitter because he was 

1496
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:41,900
making fun of ghostbusters.
Became bigger than ever became like this

1497
01:01:41,901 --> 01:01:45,860
cultural icon because it's publicity.
You can't pay for it.

1498
01:01:45,861 --> 01:01:48,090
Look at Ariel Hawaii.
Bad example in Hawaii.

1499
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:51,110
Do you remember when the use banned him?
Kicked him out and they went on.

1500
01:01:51,111 --> 01:01:53,690
All those networks use like my bad.
My bad.

1501
01:01:53,691 --> 01:01:54,630
Your backend?
Yeah,

1502
01:01:54,710 --> 01:01:55,550
for a little while.
And now he's.

1503
01:01:56,100 --> 01:01:57,360
Is he out again?
Yeah.

1504
01:01:58,150 --> 01:01:59,570
Again,
because of the brock lesnar thing.

1505
01:02:00,140 --> 01:02:03,290
Remember when he was in New York?
I don't think so.

1506
01:02:03,950 --> 01:02:06,590
Was He there in the arena?
Did he have press credentials?

1507
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:08,680
I saw him walking around like,
oh,

1508
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:11,870
he was fired from Fox.
That's what he was fired from Fox.

1509
01:02:11,890 --> 01:02:12,430
Yeah,
yeah,

1510
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:15,380
but not fired from his shot and doing 
the UFC me.

1511
01:02:15,381 --> 01:02:17,900
So he's banned from being in the media 
for a little while.

1512
01:02:17,901 --> 01:02:19,540
Then they let them back in and it works.
Yeah.

1513
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:23,130
But the thing is in,
in Dana's defense and the ucs defenses,

1514
01:02:23,310 --> 01:02:24,490
the NFL,
you know,

1515
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:27,330
certain leagues do that.
They don't,

1516
01:02:27,331 --> 01:02:32,331
they don't allow certain people in.
So it's not like as much as North Korea 

1517
01:02:32,611 --> 01:02:34,740
is that we thought like there's,
there are leaks.

1518
01:02:34,741 --> 01:02:39,360
Who Band guys from coming to the events?
Well I dunno,

1519
01:02:39,690 --> 01:02:44,690
I dunno what the fuck the NFL does,
so it's not even worth me talking about 

1520
01:02:44,690 --> 01:02:44,690
it.
How about Habib number?

1521
01:02:44,690 --> 01:02:47,090
Good men off the fucking scary monster 
that guys.

1522
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:48,480
But here's the thing,
he did get clipped,

1523
01:02:48,830 --> 01:02:53,830
slept.
Michael Johnson clipped him and I'm 

1524
01:02:53,830 --> 01:02:53,830
watching that.

1525
01:02:53,830 --> 01:02:54,000
I was like,
what would connor due to this kid bright

1526
01:02:54,090 --> 01:02:56,300
because before I'm like kind of get 
marked by Khabib.

1527
01:02:56,350 --> 01:03:01,350
And I saw him like,
well if Johnson lands that you bet your 

1528
01:03:01,350 --> 01:03:01,460
sweet ass connor's going to land that 
magical lefthand.

1529
01:03:01,660 --> 01:03:06,660
I'm,
I'm done questioned what conner's 

1530
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:06,660
capable of because I was like,
Eddie is a tough matchup.

1531
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:08,310
I think he's gonna win this one.
I do.

1532
01:03:08,650 --> 01:03:10,500
God Damn.
I'm scared for this fight.

1533
01:03:10,590 --> 01:03:13,470
I kind of want to see him fight Woodley.
I'd love to see him fight Brock Lesnar.

1534
01:03:13,710 --> 01:03:18,710
I want to see him take months off.
I wanted to see him take six months off 

1535
01:03:18,710 --> 01:03:19,350
and bulk up.
You know what's crazy?

1536
01:03:19,351 --> 01:03:24,351
A little bit of meat.
It's not that outlandish to see that 

1537
01:03:24,351 --> 01:03:24,750
that's possible.
No,

1538
01:03:24,751 --> 01:03:26,180
it's not.
It's totally possible.

1539
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:26,720
The,
the,

1540
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:30,780
the hiccup in that is the UFC is like 
how do we just let him get all the belts

1541
01:03:30,781 --> 01:03:33,300
and all the control,
like where do we stop it before,

1542
01:03:33,390 --> 01:03:38,390
before he's running this stuff to give 
up one of his belts to take on another 

1543
01:03:38,390 --> 01:03:38,390
one.

1544
01:03:38,610 --> 01:03:40,350
He needs to get about 45,
45,

1545
01:03:40,740 --> 01:03:42,450
45.
He's never going to fight there again.

1546
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:45,950
He might know that that cut down a tough
match,

1547
01:03:46,230 --> 01:03:49,950
but the cuts different now because 
you're allowed to begin your rehydration

1548
01:03:49,951 --> 01:03:51,570
much earlier.
You can weigh in at 8:00

1549
01:03:51,571 --> 01:03:53,490
in the morning,
eight to 10 in the morning.

1550
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:56,240
So by the time the ceremonial way in 
rolls around,

1551
01:03:56,270 --> 01:03:57,690
it was in New York City at 6:00
PM.

1552
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:00,300
He was full.
I mean he looked great.

1553
01:04:00,390 --> 01:04:05,390
He didn't look dehydrated at all at 55.
But even at 55 you used to look 

1554
01:04:05,390 --> 01:04:05,390
dehydrated,
right?

1555
01:04:05,390 --> 01:04:06,420
Not too bad.
40th five.

1556
01:04:06,421 --> 01:04:09,850
He lived near the door of death and also
start.

1557
01:04:09,870 --> 01:04:11,850
We've never really seen him at 55 in the
UFC.

1558
01:04:11,851 --> 01:04:14,680
I haven't seen him in case or some other
organization.

1559
01:04:14,681 --> 01:04:15,990
So it was 45.
It just,

1560
01:04:15,991 --> 01:04:17,740
I don't see how even makes it even as 
camps,

1561
01:04:17,741 --> 01:04:18,140
like,
dude,

1562
01:04:18,150 --> 01:04:19,350
it's way too tough on him.

1563
01:04:19,590 --> 01:04:21,870
Just let that belt go though.
Now you did your thing.

1564
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:24,690
Let it go because you're keeping that 
division hostage.

1565
01:04:24,870 --> 01:04:27,300
You got pedes Max Holloway coming up.
It's funny.

1566
01:04:27,390 --> 01:04:32,390
I think it's hilarious too.
It's funny because it's not my 

1567
01:04:32,390 --> 01:04:32,390
lifestyle,
but if I was,

1568
01:04:32,390 --> 01:04:35,481
although I'd be fucking freaking out,
although he was the champ forever three 

1569
01:04:35,481 --> 01:04:37,330
match so bad it ain't happening because 
he really retired.

1570
01:04:37,620 --> 01:04:40,200
He retired and then thought he was going
to go do something else,

1571
01:04:40,201 --> 01:04:42,810
and he was like,
and that he thought the use was like,

1572
01:04:42,811 --> 01:04:43,470
oh,
okay,

1573
01:04:43,530 --> 01:04:48,530
do your thing.
And then he realized how tough those 

1574
01:04:48,530 --> 01:04:48,530
contractors and came back.
He's like,

1575
01:04:48,530 --> 01:04:52,820
well,
looks like I have to fight and let's do 

1576
01:04:52,820 --> 01:04:52,820
it.
You know,

1577
01:04:52,820 --> 01:04:52,820
like,
who's he gonna fight.

1578
01:04:52,820 --> 01:04:56,930
I wonder if Petterson Holloway always 
been knocking on the fucking door for a 

1579
01:04:56,930 --> 01:04:57,330
long time,
man.

1580
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:59,480
Nine straight.
How he does this ridiculous.

1581
01:04:59,481 --> 01:05:00,930
Just needs a bigger name.
He just,

1582
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:02,550
he just,
he needs getting more famous.

1583
01:05:02,551 --> 01:05:05,670
That's the day and age when he just 
asked to get famous or get on the mic,

1584
01:05:05,671 --> 01:05:10,671
talk some shit.
I'm really interested to see him versus 

1585
01:05:10,671 --> 01:05:11,340
pedes pedes.
I think it's real diminished by that.

1586
01:05:11,341 --> 01:05:12,240
Cut.
I agree.

1587
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:15,680
That's a hard cut for him to get on 45.
And um,

1588
01:05:15,750 --> 01:05:17,920
I love this man.
I'm a huge fan,

1589
01:05:18,670 --> 01:05:21,340
but I,
he hasn't looked the same as of late.

1590
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:23,440
Max Holloway is a slick motherfucker 
too.

1591
01:05:23,441 --> 01:05:27,130
You realize it now after you watch 
Frankie Edgar and Jeremy Stevens fight,

1592
01:05:27,310 --> 01:05:30,550
you realize how Slick Holloway is.
It was never in trouble in that fight,

1593
01:05:30,610 --> 01:05:35,610
never went.
And then also think about his last last 

1594
01:05:35,610 --> 01:05:35,610
was conor mcgregor.
Conor,

1595
01:05:35,610 --> 01:05:37,540
how jacked up knee,
but I went to decision the only decision

1596
01:05:37,541 --> 01:05:40,980
congress had in the UFC and think how 
much better Max Holloway's now.

1597
01:05:41,030 --> 01:05:42,160
Yep.
If he wins this one,

1598
01:05:42,161 --> 01:05:43,800
dear God,
if someone's listening to that,

1599
01:05:43,810 --> 01:05:45,100
get a title shot.
Yeah.

1600
01:05:45,340 --> 01:05:46,690
What's you have to do?
I know.

1601
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:48,820
What do you do with Tony and Khabib 
though?

1602
01:05:49,060 --> 01:05:54,060
You're talking about too crazy wind 
streaks to like how do you even just 

1603
01:05:54,521 --> 01:05:56,970
making flight has.
That's the life thing.

1604
01:05:57,010 --> 01:05:58,660
You make them fight,
fight,

1605
01:05:58,820 --> 01:06:01,150
but let's say you had to pick one of 
them.

1606
01:06:01,270 --> 01:06:03,400
If is a guy off at 55 and three months.

1607
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:04,750
Who the fuck wants some?
Well,

1608
01:06:04,780 --> 01:06:06,790
right now,
before that fight,

1609
01:06:07,060 --> 01:06:08,650
Tony Ferguson was the number one 
contender.

1610
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:10,110
Rightly so.
Just beat Hoffeld.

1611
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:12,460
Dos Anjos beat a shitload of guys.
He's so active.

1612
01:06:12,461 --> 01:06:13,690
Your speed.
Edson Barboza,

1613
01:06:13,691 --> 01:06:16,570
he was the number one contender 
according to whatever the rankings are,

1614
01:06:16,571 --> 01:06:21,571
which I don't think are accurate.
All of a sudden toss some of them kind 

1615
01:06:21,571 --> 01:06:21,571
of.
So yeah.

1616
01:06:21,571 --> 01:06:24,070
But the second position right now,
if he's still number one,

1617
01:06:24,071 --> 01:06:26,050
is clearly habib.
Habib was number one,

1618
01:06:26,051 --> 01:06:28,130
but have has been way more inactive than
Tony.

1619
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:31,990
But the way a be mauled.
Michael Johnson,

1620
01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:34,420
I think he makes his case.
That was an old hall.

1621
01:06:34,421 --> 01:06:37,900
We both have a cake ones.
Undefeated ones on knife fight,

1622
01:06:38,050 --> 01:06:39,850
win streak.
And then Tony,

1623
01:06:40,230 --> 01:06:42,340
you know,
I thought he dismantled RDF.

1624
01:06:42,341 --> 01:06:43,390
It looked great.
Amazing.

1625
01:06:43,420 --> 01:06:44,800
Khabib.
Absolutely.

1626
01:06:44,801 --> 01:06:49,801
Ragdolled dos Anjos two and then fucking
make a destroy.

1627
01:06:50,051 --> 01:06:51,100
Johnson was horrible.

1628
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:53,230
Watching them beat up Johnson because 
he.

1629
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:58,240
He's so good at tying up that one arm.
He ties up the one arm then fucking 

1630
01:06:58,240 --> 01:06:58,240
smashes.
You.

1631
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:01,990
Wish you had them in mountain home with 
one arm.

1632
01:07:02,030 --> 01:07:05,290
Try to protect them and he's getting 
just thumped in the head.

1633
01:07:05,710 --> 01:07:08,380
It's got a hold of that chicken wing.
Other than snap that bitch up.

1634
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:09,280
Yeah.
That's not good.

1635
01:07:09,430 --> 01:07:11,920
I thought it was too,
but they'd tap.

1636
01:07:11,921 --> 01:07:13,570
Please tap.
It was like brave heart.

1637
01:07:13,660 --> 01:07:15,550
Just come on man.
Say it deep.

1638
01:07:15,610 --> 01:07:20,610
It was so deep too.
I was thinking Nog when Nog and Frank 

1639
01:07:20,610 --> 01:07:20,610
Mir fall.
That's what I was thinking.

1640
01:07:20,610 --> 01:07:21,430
I was like,
this is going to snap,

1641
01:07:22,030 --> 01:07:24,670
but like same with Henzel,
whether you refused the tap,

1642
01:07:24,671 --> 01:07:27,670
I get that you're pursuing Jiu Jitsu to 
the day you die.

1643
01:07:28,270 --> 01:07:29,730
Like with trump saying let's go ahead 
and tap those,

1644
01:07:29,740 --> 01:07:30,300
sir.
Yeah,

1645
01:07:30,650 --> 01:07:31,960
yeah.
I'm glad he tapped me to.

1646
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:36,960
I was literally squeezing my hands 
together when I was doing the 

1647
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:36,960
commentary.
I'm come on tap.

1648
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:39,010
Come on top just to let now thing.
It's just when he got them down and then

1649
01:07:39,011 --> 01:07:41,290
immediately slid right into mounted 
guillotine.

1650
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:43,730
I was like,
Jesus Christ and his GRANDPA.

1651
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:45,820
Ridiculous.
So good.

1652
01:07:46,270 --> 01:07:47,470
His grappling.
So good.

1653
01:07:47,471 --> 01:07:49,170
It's confusing.
I don't.

1654
01:07:49,650 --> 01:07:50,470
Yeah.
If so,

1655
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:51,760
why?
Those two?

1656
01:07:51,761 --> 01:07:55,750
Fighting the fight.
Fight conor and Habiba the fight.

1657
01:07:55,810 --> 01:07:56,740
That's the,
that's not happening,

1658
01:07:56,750 --> 01:07:58,960
but I think Khabib needs to get the 
title,

1659
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:00,400
uh,
to get a title shot.

1660
01:08:00,401 --> 01:08:02,410
At least that's what I think.
I think you should.

1661
01:08:02,470 --> 01:08:05,110
I think he deserves it.
He's the only undefeated challenger.

1662
01:08:05,380 --> 01:08:07,750
He's a monster.
He's mauled everybody in front of him.

1663
01:08:07,751 --> 01:08:09,580
He hasn't had a single God damn close 
fight.

1664
01:08:09,850 --> 01:08:12,670
He said one moment,
one moment where he gets dinged,

1665
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:13,720
but you're,
you're talking,

1666
01:08:13,750 --> 01:08:17,060
you're speaking logically.
You think getting guys that deserve it.

1667
01:08:17,630 --> 01:08:18,110
Well,
we're.

1668
01:08:18,410 --> 01:08:19,490
We're an entertainment,
sir.

1669
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:22,700
Just the same way conor leapfrogged.
Everyone got the title shot.

1670
01:08:22,820 --> 01:08:24,140
Listen to what I'm saying to you right 
now.

1671
01:08:25,670 --> 01:08:29,600
The UFC is about to go to Russia.
Do you know that?

1672
01:08:29,630 --> 01:08:30,540
Yeah.
They want to get in.

1673
01:08:30,570 --> 01:08:32,000
The downloads are going to do it.
Yeah.

1674
01:08:32,001 --> 01:08:32,750
Yeah,
for sure.

1675
01:08:32,751 --> 01:08:37,680
To see in Russia,
conor mcgregor versus Habib Yarmulke met

1676
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:41,530
off.
That's what I think is common gi.

1677
01:08:43,010 --> 01:08:46,760
There's a lot of rush.
Just shy kids got on the mic right?

1678
01:08:46,761 --> 01:08:47,320
And was like,
yeah,

1679
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:50,480
you know how much bigger fucking Russia 
is than Ireland,

1680
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:56,200
but he's not the same star.
Well here's the rushes bigger than 

1681
01:08:56,421 --> 01:09:01,421
Ireland,
but the United States bigger than 

1682
01:09:01,421 --> 01:09:03,701
Ireland too.
And when fucking connor is fighting in 

1683
01:09:03,701 --> 01:09:06,491
New York City,
which is an hour and a half from Eddie 

1684
01:09:06,491 --> 01:09:06,491
Alvarez House,
they're booing.

1685
01:09:06,491 --> 01:09:09,050
Eddie Alvarez is walking to the cage.
It doesn't matter.

1686
01:09:09,110 --> 01:09:09,950
Russia,
China,

1687
01:09:09,951 --> 01:09:12,400
Korea.
Ireland is the biggest star by far.

1688
01:09:12,660 --> 01:09:14,600
I don't know about that.
When you go to Russia,

1689
01:09:14,910 --> 01:09:19,910
I wonder if he gets booed in Russia,
don't you think if Kobi was that big of 

1690
01:09:19,971 --> 01:09:21,200
a star in Russia,
maybe.

1691
01:09:21,230 --> 01:09:23,870
Maybe it's a sanction and stuff and they
are going there.

1692
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:26,540
If you check my instagram page every 
time a fucking photo gets up,

1693
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:28,590
I know time,
reading time.

1694
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:29,630
I agree.
King.

1695
01:09:29,860 --> 01:09:30,830
No,
he champ.

1696
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:35,920
He deserves it,
but there's a reason why it hasn't been 

1697
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:36,650
the headline of a paper view.
Maybe in the states here.

1698
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:37,670
Maybe.
Yeah,

1699
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:42,700
maybe,
but he is a fucking monster and he's a 

1700
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:43,690
hero to the Russian mma fans.
Correct.

1701
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:46,880
This guy from Dagestan has been mall in 
everybody.

1702
01:09:46,881 --> 01:09:49,700
They put in front of them and people 
think and rightly so,

1703
01:09:49,701 --> 01:09:53,570
that he's unjustly keeping being kept 
rather from a title shot.

1704
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:56,800
We can't say it's been kept from Natasha
and he's been injured for a long.

1705
01:09:56,830 --> 01:09:58,820
That's true too.
Who's keeping them from getting injured?

1706
01:09:58,850 --> 01:10:00,380
The blame.
Then a AK.

1707
01:10:00,381 --> 01:10:01,850
That's not commerce.
That's true,

1708
01:10:01,940 --> 01:10:06,110
but they did promise him this fight.
This was something that they said,

1709
01:10:06,111 --> 01:10:07,540
no,
Habib gets the next shot.

1710
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:12,560
The title.
This was something that was publicly 

1711
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:14,141
stated,
which made sense at the time because 

1712
01:10:14,141 --> 01:10:16,421
it'd be was 23 and he's going to fight 
massive square garden for the title 

1713
01:10:16,421 --> 01:10:20,470
because what they were saying,
talking about the connor versus Eddie 

1714
01:10:20,470 --> 01:10:21,040
Alvarez can't have that.
That doesn't sell tickets exactly how it

1715
01:10:21,060 --> 01:10:21,430
went.
Nah,

1716
01:10:21,431 --> 01:10:23,630
I want to fight that with cookie.
We'll keep you on the car once you.

1717
01:10:23,750 --> 01:10:28,750
Once you find on the undercard though,
I imagine how he feels when he hears 

1718
01:10:28,750 --> 01:10:28,750
that Shit,
man.

1719
01:10:28,750 --> 01:10:29,090
He gets that phone call.
He thinks this is it.

1720
01:10:29,091 --> 01:10:34,091
Finally I got the title.
He went in his backyard and beat the 

1721
01:10:34,091 --> 01:10:34,091
shit out of Kodiak bear.

1722
01:10:34,340 --> 01:10:37,100
He said,
have you ever seen that video?

1723
01:10:37,270 --> 01:10:38,930
He was a kid.
It's awesome.

1724
01:10:38,931 --> 01:10:39,650
Yeah.
He's a kid.

1725
01:10:39,780 --> 01:10:43,120
So much tougher than anyone I know so 
got into.

1726
01:10:43,310 --> 01:10:48,310
He's ridiculous.
His grappling is ridiculous and I'm 

1727
01:10:48,310 --> 01:10:49,470
really interested in seeing whether or 
not he can get past that lefthand and I.

1728
01:10:49,670 --> 01:10:52,160
If you are correct and that's the fight 
in Russia,

1729
01:10:52,370 --> 01:10:57,370
the amount of money they're going to 
have to pay connor to fight him in 

1730
01:10:57,370 --> 01:11:00,581
Russia when connor is still the draw.
You're talking about a different 

1731
01:11:00,581 --> 01:11:02,030
ballgame.
Show me the money.

1732
01:11:02,090 --> 01:11:07,090
It's going to be interesting though,
like what other Russian bad assets are 

1733
01:11:07,090 --> 01:11:07,090
there?
They're fighting UFC.

1734
01:11:07,090 --> 01:11:08,300
Did you see that?
I'm a chorus.

1735
01:11:08,310 --> 01:11:13,310
Cough.
Just got knocked the fuck out in 

1736
01:11:13,310 --> 01:11:13,310
Beltour.
Yes.

1737
01:11:13,310 --> 01:11:14,010
Which was crazy to Lima.
To him as a

1738
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:15,930
bad motherfucker.
Of course.

1739
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:16,920
Godzilla Monster.
Yeah.

1740
01:11:16,930 --> 01:11:21,090
Speaking of Russians are in that area.
And not to flip the script here,

1741
01:11:21,091 --> 01:11:26,091
but this weekend is Andre Ward verse.
I'm fricking Kovalev boxing match up a 

1742
01:11:28,091 --> 01:11:29,820
long time.
No one's talking about either.

1743
01:11:29,830 --> 01:11:31,050
That's not.
I know.

1744
01:11:31,110 --> 01:11:33,000
I've been watching all the countdowns 
and shit.

1745
01:11:33,001 --> 01:11:34,350
I can't get enough of it.
I know.

1746
01:11:34,351 --> 01:11:36,390
I've watched that last countdown thing.
They did too.

1747
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:39,240
It was on after the um,
Victor Ortiz fight.

1748
01:11:39,630 --> 01:11:41,100
Yeah.
It looked like shit.

1749
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:46,130
Well,
the duty fall was like on sort of 

1750
01:11:46,130 --> 01:11:46,130
survival mode.
He was terrified.

1751
01:11:46,130 --> 01:11:47,690
He didn't throw any punches,
nothing.

1752
01:11:47,700 --> 01:11:49,590
They sit through the whole fight.
He threw 100 and something.

1753
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:51,930
He was so scared and then Ortiz was 
touching me.

1754
01:11:51,931 --> 01:11:53,670
Pretend to fall down because he's like 
waiting for.

1755
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:58,750
Lydia was grabbing his head.
San Diego hit in the back of the head a 

1756
01:11:58,750 --> 01:11:58,750
couple of times.
It was a terrible fight.

1757
01:11:58,750 --> 01:12:00,030
Wasn't good,
but yet you're right.

1758
01:12:00,031 --> 01:12:04,080
Right after that was Andre Ward Kovalev 
like the countdown,

1759
01:12:04,081 --> 01:12:06,720
kind of their background and Andre Ward.
To me,

1760
01:12:06,721 --> 01:12:08,640
he's just a bigger version of floyd 
mayweather.

1761
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:11,010
Like his defense is insane.
He has knockout.

1762
01:12:11,011 --> 01:12:14,550
Power isn't lost since he's 13.
I give him the advantage.

1763
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:17,490
Some people think a cove to when I don't
know what the betting odds are.

1764
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:22,700
I was stunned.
By the way [inaudible] handled hopkins 

1765
01:12:22,700 --> 01:12:23,730
and I know Bernard's old.
He's 100 years old.

1766
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:25,380
It was a thousand.
It looks like a turtle.

1767
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:27,240
He looks old.
He was fighting again,

1768
01:12:27,540 --> 01:12:30,410
December 10th or twelfth in La.
You're not going to lie.

1769
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:33,600
I'm not going to that sort of leader.
I'm going to be in.

1770
01:12:33,620 --> 01:12:37,110
That's the Toronto UFC that weekend.
It's also the weekend of glory.

1771
01:12:37,111 --> 01:12:40,290
That's Badr Hari versus Rico Verhoeven.
Was that the best weekend ever?

1772
01:12:40,490 --> 01:12:41,490
Besides that,
I've been site.

1773
01:12:41,570 --> 01:12:44,430
That's a good fucking car.
That Toronto card is static.

1774
01:12:44,430 --> 01:12:47,070
It is now because you've got Kennedy 
shot,

1775
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:52,280
cowboy,
Matt Brown cowboy versus Matt Brown is 

1776
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:52,820
better than cowboy versus gasoline.
100.

1777
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:54,360
That fight did nothing for me.
Well,

1778
01:12:54,460 --> 01:12:56,880
gaslamp's done now man.
He's in a bad,

1779
01:12:56,881 --> 01:12:58,080
bad,
bad place.

1780
01:12:58,110 --> 01:13:00,180
Dana says 85.
Now he's missed.

1781
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:03,300
He's said that before and made him fight
85 mayberry beat.

1782
01:13:03,301 --> 01:13:05,700
Nate Marquardt a five.
Correct.

1783
01:13:05,701 --> 01:13:09,690
So it wasn't a 5:35.
Mark know if my mark artist 70 was it?

1784
01:13:09,691 --> 01:13:14,691
Yeah,
it was one of those fights that he beat 

1785
01:13:14,691 --> 01:13:17,361
somebody because he got sent up to 85.
Then he proved that he could make the 

1786
01:13:17,361 --> 01:13:18,030
weight and he's blaming George Lockhart 
now.

1787
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:20,820
Now the only person you can blame is 
yourself.

1788
01:13:20,850 --> 01:13:21,540
Like,
you know,

1789
01:13:21,541 --> 01:13:23,360
man,
especially being an experiences,

1790
01:13:23,370 --> 01:13:24,690
you know.
And that's.

1791
01:13:24,691 --> 01:13:26,520
It's so frustrating.
That shows you.

1792
01:13:26,521 --> 01:13:27,660
What kind of car do you have?
C,

1793
01:13:27,661 --> 01:13:30,270
two.
A five was I'd even blink to.

1794
01:13:30,271 --> 01:13:31,200
I didn't bat an eye that.

1795
01:13:31,290 --> 01:13:32,160
Alright,
what's next?

1796
01:13:32,220 --> 01:13:34,380
Look at this fucking car.
I know Tim Kay were shot.

1797
01:13:34,381 --> 01:13:35,400
That sucks.
Oh my God.

1798
01:13:35,401 --> 01:13:36,720
Look at this card.
Yeah.

1799
01:13:37,050 --> 01:13:42,050
Well now Toronto's just gassed.
Alum is a really elite fighter.

1800
01:13:42,810 --> 01:13:45,240
He's a very tough guy,
tough guys.

1801
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:47,190
I'm a big fan of.
That kid I think is awesome,

1802
01:13:47,220 --> 01:13:49,650
but he needs to lose some fucking body 
fat.

1803
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:50,940
Period.
You're not a heavyweight.

1804
01:13:50,941 --> 01:13:53,850
You're not Cain Velasquez.
He can't walk around with that much body

1805
01:13:53,910 --> 01:13:56,400
when he posts on instagram like a week 
before,

1806
01:13:56,401 --> 01:13:58,770
two weeks before a fight,
like real Mexican dinner.

1807
01:13:58,780 --> 01:14:00,980
It's like these fucking Burritos,
enchiladas stuff,

1808
01:14:01,850 --> 01:14:02,790
man.
We can't have that.

1809
01:14:02,791 --> 01:14:04,530
We cannot have that.
Can do that.

1810
01:14:04,650 --> 01:14:09,650
He,
I mean he's an elite professional 

1811
01:14:09,650 --> 01:14:11,331
athlete who absolutely could.
Still to this day when the world title 

1812
01:14:11,331 --> 01:14:12,040
he has a skill for has the scale and 
he's

1813
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:13,780
fought the guys.
He beat Woodley.

1814
01:14:13,781 --> 01:14:18,781
Yeah.
Did he it the decision decision where he

1815
01:14:19,661 --> 01:14:21,340
didn't fucking make weight.
There you go.

1816
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:26,400
That was a decision where he didn't 
fucking make weight and Woodley being a 

1817
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:27,820
great guy that he is.
Didn't take the percentage.

1818
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:28,750
Thirty percent.
Yeah.

1819
01:14:28,751 --> 01:14:29,650
20.
I think it is.

1820
01:14:29,770 --> 01:14:31,080
When your opponent doesn't make her 
wait.

1821
01:14:31,140 --> 01:14:32,380
Still a persistent 30,
30.

1822
01:14:32,890 --> 01:14:34,320
I thought it was 20.
Um,

1823
01:14:34,390 --> 01:14:36,700
Woodley being a great guy.
He has said I don't want that money.

1824
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:39,940
And he beat him by decision because.
So will he got the win bonus too?

1825
01:14:39,941 --> 01:14:44,941
But Calvin,
I don't know who calvin is fought at 85 

1826
01:14:44,941 --> 01:14:48,630
in the last few years,
but he's been forced at one point in 

1827
01:14:48,630 --> 01:14:51,010
time to go up to 85.
She needs to fucking lose body fat.

1828
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:53,690
Just lose it and keep it off dude.
And any time a fight,

1829
01:14:53,691 --> 01:14:54,880
it doesn't make wait.

1830
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:57,910
Mike Dolce jumps out like Chris Hanson 
from to catch a predator.

1831
01:14:58,750 --> 01:15:01,430
Excuse me to take a seat.
You want to sit down and he,

1832
01:15:01,431 --> 01:15:04,480
he cannot wait to tweet out.
Ah Man.

1833
01:15:04,481 --> 01:15:06,100
It's frustrating when guys.
Ms Dot Wade.

1834
01:15:06,260 --> 01:15:09,690
Yeah he does.
He is just super thirsty and nice.

1835
01:15:09,990 --> 01:15:11,650
Chris Hansen,
I catch a predator.

1836
01:15:11,830 --> 01:15:14,230
Just fucking can't wait to tweet about 
it.

1837
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:15,760
Will don't you?
He's got a whole staff.

1838
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:18,780
He's got a staff of people.
He's expensive but yeah,

1839
01:15:18,781 --> 01:15:20,860
he's got a.
well it is expensive for a reason.

1840
01:15:20,861 --> 01:15:22,570
It's kind of.
It's got an office building.

1841
01:15:24,530 --> 01:15:29,530
Well he's an employee of the UFC too.
Well I think he has like nine employees 

1842
01:15:29,530 --> 01:15:30,520
or something crazy.
Just looking up.

1843
01:15:30,650 --> 01:15:33,250
Shoot to fucking lose weight and shit.
Yeah,

1844
01:15:33,310 --> 01:15:38,310
but it comes out of the curtain.
So a lot of sway disagree with him 

1845
01:15:38,310 --> 01:15:41,581
though.
A lot of people disagree with some of 

1846
01:15:41,581 --> 01:15:41,581
his methods and lock arms.

1847
01:15:41,581 --> 01:15:41,620
Bj Penn.
Yeah.

1848
01:15:41,621 --> 01:15:43,390
Well he was.
He was just upset that.

1849
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:45,280
Well he was upset for a bunch of 
reasons.

1850
01:15:45,281 --> 01:15:47,440
You need to wait though,
but he was upset.

1851
01:15:47,441 --> 01:15:50,980
They don't charge them so much and you 
knoW that he really didn't do much.

1852
01:15:50,981 --> 01:15:53,110
I don't know the whole story.
I don't know the whole story either.

1853
01:15:53,140 --> 01:15:55,540
I'm not taking sides there,
but I will tell you this.

1854
01:15:55,541 --> 01:15:59,500
Bj penn's tHat got damn legend.
So I'm siding with him usually he's from

1855
01:15:59,501 --> 01:16:00,940
Hawaii.
Yeah.

1856
01:16:01,090 --> 01:16:02,450
I don't know what the fuck happened 
either.

1857
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:07,500
You'd have to be there,
but the point is like if you have 

1858
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:09,970
someone who is monitoring every aspect 
of your weight,

1859
01:16:09,971 --> 01:16:12,600
cut like your hydration levels with 
what,

1860
01:16:12,660 --> 01:16:17,660
what kind of fluid you're drinking,
what kind of foods you're eating and it 

1861
01:16:17,660 --> 01:16:20,371
doesn't work out.
If you did what that guy said and the 

1862
01:16:20,371 --> 01:16:21,520
weight didn't come off,
somebody fucked up who fucked up.

1863
01:16:21,580 --> 01:16:22,580
I don't know.
It'd be the case,

1864
01:16:22,930 --> 01:16:23,980
but let me ask you this,
joe,

1865
01:16:24,490 --> 01:16:25,480
if some,
if,

1866
01:16:25,510 --> 01:16:29,830
if let's say it's not ufc 205 this week 
by 10 pounds though,

1867
01:16:29,860 --> 01:16:31,780
which is ridiculous,
but let's say it's not use to.

1868
01:16:31,781 --> 01:16:35,290
If I were to card not a stack,
let's say it's a main event in toronto,

1869
01:16:35,430 --> 01:16:37,540
uh,
with dc and a grumble,

1870
01:16:37,541 --> 01:16:41,590
which before that card was pure shit.
Besides that fight now to amazing card,

1871
01:16:41,591 --> 01:16:42,880
yet metallica,
anthony pettis,

1872
01:16:42,881 --> 01:16:43,120
blah,
blah,

1873
01:16:43,121 --> 01:16:48,121
blah.
Would it be crazy for the new ufc suits 

1874
01:16:48,340 --> 01:16:52,720
to hire nutritionist and they,
for those maybe just the main card,

1875
01:16:52,990 --> 01:16:56,710
they designate you a guide to help you 
lose weight because it's your product.

1876
01:16:56,740 --> 01:16:58,690
It's not a bad idea.
However,

1877
01:16:58,691 --> 01:17:03,691
I think maybe michael j.
It works with everyone and he has a 

1878
01:17:03,691 --> 01:17:04,020
team.
Maybe it's not my dolce,

1879
01:17:04,030 --> 01:17:09,030
but he's writing the plan.
This your diet and this person is 

1880
01:17:09,030 --> 01:17:11,581
assigned to you and they're following up
with you because who it hurt when they 

1881
01:17:11,581 --> 01:17:14,801
don't make weight,
it hurts the fighter and then it hurts 

1882
01:17:14,801 --> 01:17:14,801
the ufc to sign cards.

1883
01:17:14,801 --> 01:17:18,860
I think an even better strategy is seek 
to eliminate weight cuts.

1884
01:17:18,950 --> 01:17:21,500
Seek to cut it out of sport.
It's unnecessary.

1885
01:17:21,530 --> 01:17:26,530
It's dangerous.
It puts guys at risk health wise when 

1886
01:17:26,530 --> 01:17:26,960
they don't have to be at risk health 
wise.

1887
01:17:27,180 --> 01:17:29,480
If I think the only thing that's holding
it back,

1888
01:17:29,481 --> 01:17:32,930
our championship belts and more options 
await classes.

1889
01:17:33,110 --> 01:17:38,110
I think if they could figure out what 
wait guys are where they compete at 

1890
01:17:38,110 --> 01:17:41,500
optimally and then the same way you do 
us a da or usada testing.

1891
01:17:42,170 --> 01:17:44,720
You do hydration testing,
but how.

1892
01:17:44,750 --> 01:17:47,930
But how many weight class you'd have to 
give these guys killing weight class?

1893
01:17:47,931 --> 01:17:48,760
Yes.
Yep.

1894
01:17:48,860 --> 01:17:53,860
You have.
You have more weight class with any of 

1895
01:17:53,860 --> 01:17:53,860
boxing?
No,

1896
01:17:53,860 --> 01:17:53,860
that's what's the problem.
It's not a problem with boxing.

1897
01:17:53,870 --> 01:17:56,420
They'll look and they're going to fight 
you.

1898
01:17:56,450 --> 01:18:01,450
Will you have less organizations?
It's not like you have five different 

1899
01:18:01,450 --> 01:18:02,390
world title organizations and plus 
weight classes.

1900
01:18:02,570 --> 01:18:06,150
You would just have plus weight classes.
I think you would have more champions.

1901
01:18:06,151 --> 01:18:08,540
You'd have more opportunity for 
championship titles.

1902
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:12,230
I liked that because was stars.
You also have more opportunity for,

1903
01:18:12,290 --> 01:18:17,290
you know,
title bouts between guys where the one 

1904
01:18:17,290 --> 01:18:17,290
guy decides to go up.
One guy said to go down,

1905
01:18:17,290 --> 01:18:20,540
but instead of them doing it by 
dehydrating themselves,

1906
01:18:20,541 --> 01:18:25,541
24 hours out,
you make a contract to fight at a 

1907
01:18:25,541 --> 01:18:27,140
certain weight because that's what way 
you are in a healthy way,

1908
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:32,200
which is which maximizes their skills 
and performance and it doesn't put them 

1909
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:35,030
into the dangers that you have from 
being dehydrated 24 hours out.

1910
01:18:35,270 --> 01:18:39,380
I Think if just the ufe will look like.
How many weight classes do you have?

1911
01:18:39,381 --> 01:18:40,550
Where a good question.
You know what I'm saying?

1912
01:18:40,790 --> 01:18:45,790
that's one belt.
I think boxing has many and it's a real 

1913
01:18:45,790 --> 01:18:47,130
problem name,
but it's.

1914
01:18:47,150 --> 01:18:52,150
I don't care.
Name 10 stars in the ufc like you want 

1915
01:18:52,150 --> 01:18:52,150
me to?
Yeah.

1916
01:18:52,150 --> 01:18:56,590
Okay.
10 champions will tend to be in the 

1917
01:18:56,590 --> 01:18:59,180
former case in boston named champions 
and former champions easily.

1918
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:01,430
Don't you think you could name 10 
champion boxer,

1919
01:19:01,431 --> 01:19:05,150
so manny pacquiao.
Bradley,

1920
01:19:05,151 --> 01:19:10,151
if you want to start going on.
Terrence crawford has co facility has 

1921
01:19:12,550 --> 01:19:15,980
seven floyd mayweather.
You know you can keep going.

1922
01:19:15,981 --> 01:19:18,430
You can name a bunch of champions in 
boxes.

1923
01:19:18,440 --> 01:19:20,040
Little.
All those guys run in the same way.

1924
01:19:20,060 --> 01:19:20,990
Yeah,
that's true.

1925
01:19:21,140 --> 01:19:22,520
That's true.
But you know,

1926
01:19:22,521 --> 01:19:26,540
you go up and heavyweight,
you got fucking klitschko wilder.

1927
01:19:26,620 --> 01:19:28,690
Got to joshua's week.
Oh,

1928
01:19:28,850 --> 01:19:30,370
you did it.
What's up?

1929
01:19:30,940 --> 01:19:32,180
Let's go chill.
That's amazing.

1930
01:19:33,340 --> 01:19:34,680
Must be here today.
But uh,

1931
01:19:34,730 --> 01:19:35,660
he had to move it to.
Well,

1932
01:19:35,661 --> 01:19:36,860
yeah,
he's fighting for a world title.

1933
01:19:37,010 --> 01:19:38,270
Brilliant.
Interesting.

1934
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:39,800
That's going to be fun.
Yeah.

1935
01:19:40,260 --> 01:19:42,260
There's a lot of heavyweight talent now.
Anthony.

1936
01:19:42,261 --> 01:19:44,120
Joshua is a bad motherfucker.
Like,

1937
01:19:44,160 --> 01:19:49,160
yeah,
that guy in a fricking New Zealand that 

1938
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:49,940
everyone talks about is tyson fury doing
a.

1939
01:19:49,941 --> 01:19:54,941
He's retired and clinically like he,
he's suicidal and need some help 

1940
01:19:54,941 --> 01:19:55,880
mentally.
It's just not there.

1941
01:19:56,070 --> 01:19:57,080
well,
so he's out.

1942
01:19:57,690 --> 01:19:59,410
No,
don't.

1943
01:19:59,670 --> 01:20:01,760
It's crazy man.
That dude's crazy.

1944
01:20:04,340 --> 01:20:06,020
Characters like that.
But I,

1945
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:07,650
I,
I liked idea of job,

1946
01:20:07,651 --> 01:20:12,651
but the problem is it's stuff enough for
that are trying to keep up now with the 

1947
01:20:12,651 --> 01:20:16,131
stars.
I think that's the least of our 

1948
01:20:16,131 --> 01:20:16,131
concerns,
the most important things to put on.

1949
01:20:16,131 --> 01:20:17,460
Great fights.
So higher kids.

1950
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:19,200
How many,
how much dehydration?

1951
01:20:19,670 --> 01:20:24,600
dehydration is dangerous and unnecessary
ones died that they have in Brazil.

1952
01:20:24,990 --> 01:20:28,690
I think it can come close to the ufc,
but it hasn't even been done.

1953
01:20:28,860 --> 01:20:33,860
Do you want to dos anjos passed out for 
three fucking minutes before his fight 

1954
01:20:33,860 --> 01:20:34,350
with eddie alvarez where it was 
unconscious and unresponsive,

1955
01:20:34,470 --> 01:20:36,930
but did you die?
he was on the doorbell,

1956
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:40,170
but did you die?
Nobody's died,

1957
01:20:40,530 --> 01:20:45,530
but people have been diminished 
considerably and I think they're know 

1958
01:20:45,530 --> 01:20:47,460
for their performance suffers,
so it makes it makes a shittier product.

1959
01:20:47,890 --> 01:20:49,950
I think if you want to look at it from a
business plus,

1960
01:20:50,070 --> 01:20:51,930
if the ufc has got look,
you could say,

1961
01:20:51,931 --> 01:20:53,550
hey,
steroids are part of the game.

1962
01:20:53,790 --> 01:20:55,050
Are they?
Well,

1963
01:20:55,051 --> 01:21:00,051
not anymore.
Now they're fucking knocking on your 

1964
01:21:00,051 --> 01:21:00,051
door at 6:00
in the morning and making peanut cup.

1965
01:21:00,051 --> 01:21:01,530
If they decided to do that at 6:00
in the morning,

1966
01:21:01,531 --> 01:21:04,530
they'd try to test people's hydration 
levels at 6:00

1967
01:21:04,531 --> 01:21:07,140
in the morning every day and when I 
would find out what your weight is,

1968
01:21:07,141 --> 01:21:08,790
okay,
this is what your body fat is,

1969
01:21:08,850 --> 01:21:10,830
this is what your weight is,
this is the lowest you can get.

1970
01:21:11,010 --> 01:21:11,760
You can get,
you know,

1971
01:21:11,830 --> 01:21:14,340
they'll test you out when you're fully 
hydrated and when your,

1972
01:21:14,341 --> 01:21:15,810
your body fat is,
you know,

1973
01:21:15,811 --> 01:21:17,220
wherever the fuck you are right now,
they'll say,

1974
01:21:17,221 --> 01:21:17,850
hey,
okay,

1975
01:21:17,851 --> 01:21:22,851
right now you're 178 pounds.
LIsten to lowest you can fight is one 

1976
01:21:22,851 --> 01:21:22,851
72.
That's it.

1977
01:21:23,010 --> 01:21:25,440
You're going to have 1000 weight 
classes.

1978
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:27,630
Guys won't fight each.
I don't know about that.

1979
01:21:27,690 --> 01:21:30,330
I think guys,
some guys could gain a little weight.

1980
01:21:30,390 --> 01:21:31,640
That's no big deal.
So guys,

1981
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:33,720
I don't mind the idea.
I think you're right.

1982
01:21:33,721 --> 01:21:36,420
You're going to get great performances.
Way better performances.

1983
01:21:36,421 --> 01:21:38,790
I think the weight class thing because 
your thing to do is.

1984
01:21:38,850 --> 01:21:43,850
I agree they often need to do something,
but I think right now the easiest thing 

1985
01:21:43,850 --> 01:21:47,400
to do for them is to use whoever they 
want doesn't have to be like dolce.

1986
01:21:47,401 --> 01:21:52,401
Put a number of them and assIgn those to
the main card guys to make sure they're 

1987
01:21:52,401 --> 01:21:52,950
coming on weight.
Yeah.

1988
01:21:52,951 --> 01:21:55,170
But what about the guys on the undercard
fuck them.

1989
01:21:55,470 --> 01:21:58,500
That sounds crazy to me because that's 
what they did with reebok.

1990
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:00,210
Does it sound like crazy to say fuck 
them?

1991
01:22:00,211 --> 01:22:03,270
Yes it does,
but that's the nature of the beast,

1992
01:22:03,300 --> 01:22:06,630
but I think that's crazy.
Too crazy.

1993
01:22:06,631 --> 01:22:08,730
I'm just following the orders.
I understand that,

1994
01:22:08,910 --> 01:22:11,790
but I'm saying if.
If I had the master key,

1995
01:22:12,210 --> 01:22:17,210
the first thing I would do is say come 
up with a strategy to stop weight 

1996
01:22:17,210 --> 01:22:17,210
cutting.

1997
01:22:17,210 --> 01:22:22,040
We're going to come up with a new plan 
and whether that new plan means 

1998
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:23,640
abandoning world titles and making care.
Yes.

1999
01:22:23,641 --> 01:22:28,641
Yes.
Now you introduce someone as a world 

2000
01:22:28,641 --> 01:22:28,641
champIon.
You know whoever the fuck they are,

2001
01:22:28,641 --> 01:22:30,570
they get to bring their world title to 
the fight,

2002
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:34,380
but whenever their next title defenses 
or whatever the fuck it is,

2003
01:22:34,680 --> 01:22:37,080
all this name stuff,
welter,

2004
01:22:37,081 --> 01:22:38,580
light feather.
First of all,

2005
01:22:38,581 --> 01:22:40,170
it's goofy because it's not the right 
weight.

2006
01:22:40,210 --> 01:22:43,080
Anyway.
Welterweight is not one 70.

2007
01:22:43,081 --> 01:22:45,840
It's 1:47.
That's what sugar ray leonard and thomas

2008
01:22:45,841 --> 01:22:50,841
hearns fatah.
They called it fucking welterweight to 

2009
01:22:50,841 --> 01:22:50,841
start the ufc and just to say,
well,

2010
01:22:50,841 --> 01:22:54,660
it's welterweight and then pride fucked 
it up even more because they had it.

2011
01:22:54,690 --> 01:22:56,700
It was different,
like their middle weight was two.

2012
01:22:56,701 --> 01:22:57,270
Oh,
three.

2013
01:22:57,420 --> 01:22:59,720
Correct.
Like when the light heavyweight two.

2014
01:22:59,790 --> 01:23:00,540
Oh,
five.

2015
01:23:00,790 --> 01:23:01,980
Oh,
one 75.

2016
01:23:02,180 --> 01:23:03,740
He knows that heavyweights two.
Oh,

2017
01:23:03,741 --> 01:23:06,250
one plus we grew up in Boxing

2018
01:23:06,250 --> 01:23:08,020
and then the weight classes were clearly
defined.

2019
01:23:08,021 --> 01:23:13,021
Why the fuck does ufc have a 265 pound 
weight limit to why you making brock 

2020
01:23:13,021 --> 01:23:15,520
lesnar cut weight or whoever the fuck.
A big giant dude is like.

2021
01:23:15,521 --> 01:23:17,390
Shane,
why would you make shane cut wave?

2022
01:23:17,420 --> 01:23:22,420
He wants to weigh 300 pounds.
Let that fucking big vanilla gorilla 

2023
01:23:22,420 --> 01:23:23,170
with 300 pounds.
I want to see it.

2024
01:23:23,171 --> 01:23:24,670
Dude.
He has a matchup and rising.

2025
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:25,950
I just saw it.
Someone said,

2026
01:23:26,230 --> 01:23:26,990
I haven't seen.
Dude,

2027
01:23:27,010 --> 01:23:28,300
I've never heard of.
I've never heard him.

2028
01:23:28,301 --> 01:23:32,620
I guess he's just some fucking middle 
eastern monster.

2029
01:23:32,680 --> 01:23:37,680
Oh no.
He's an olymPic level wrestler and just 

2030
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:37,680
knocks dudes out.
Oh my god.

2031
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:37,900
Yeah.
I don't.

2032
01:23:37,901 --> 01:23:39,520
I,
I need to research on the guy,

2033
01:23:39,521 --> 01:23:41,350
but someone tagged me and I'm like,
oh my god.

2034
01:23:41,380 --> 01:23:44,400
I thought it was fate.
or though that's a big name matches.

2035
01:23:45,060 --> 01:23:50,060
It's a tournament style where you just 
winter don't fight,

2036
01:23:50,170 --> 01:23:53,350
fade or it's supposed to be like a open 
wait tournament.

2037
01:23:53,470 --> 01:23:58,470
It's dope.
What kind of work is shane had done his 

2038
01:23:58,470 --> 01:23:58,470
back?
Uh,

2039
01:23:58,470 --> 01:24:03,400
he had surgery.
I know you had a disc replacement and 

2040
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:03,760
then hit some stuff on his neck.
He had a disc replacement.

2041
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:05,290
Pretty sure.
Like they put a,

2042
01:24:05,291 --> 01:24:06,850
one of those artificial jammies in 
there.

2043
01:24:06,950 --> 01:24:09,220
Uh,
I don't want to speak for him,

2044
01:24:09,221 --> 01:24:11,530
but he had surgery on his that didn't 
get it and did it.

2045
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:13,480
The anything fuSed.
I'm not sure.

2046
01:24:13,540 --> 01:24:15,970
I don't wanna speak for shade.
I know he had surgery on his back.

2047
01:24:15,980 --> 01:24:16,330
Yeah.
Yeah.

2048
01:24:16,450 --> 01:24:20,100
I like rising because they let them take
all the vitamins you want it.

2049
01:24:20,210 --> 01:24:25,210
It's just.
I mean it's just a monster squad that 

2050
01:24:25,210 --> 01:24:27,220
they should rename it.
Monsters inc overeem to go over there to

2051
01:24:27,660 --> 01:24:32,660
me to just do the old thing.
You just do a little thing like the old 

2052
01:24:32,891 --> 01:24:35,740
time you need for gita in the face and 
ended his life.

2053
01:24:35,770 --> 01:24:36,670
Do that.
Yeah.

2054
01:24:36,671 --> 01:24:39,880
when he fought todd duffy and he looked 
like some sort of a cartoon character.

2055
01:24:40,420 --> 01:24:43,060
how fun was that?
Marrow looks small compared to them.

2056
01:24:43,061 --> 01:24:47,250
Yoel romero looked malnourished.
man,

2057
01:24:47,410 --> 01:24:49,600
it looks like he has aids next uber 
rating.

2058
01:24:51,350 --> 01:24:55,130
God damn fucking hit the gym.
Uber rich.

2059
01:24:55,180 --> 01:24:58,180
We've never seen anything like it.
Whatever reason when you and I together,

2060
01:24:58,181 --> 01:25:01,400
we just fucking have a love fest over 
this uber ring.

2061
01:25:01,420 --> 01:25:04,120
Paul doesn't exist in the lochness 
monster.

2062
01:25:04,810 --> 01:25:05,820
Obsessed with this.
Well,

2063
01:25:05,821 --> 01:25:07,510
this video though,
that's the problem.

2064
01:25:07,511 --> 01:25:09,580
There's not just like we see them and 
we'll go,

2065
01:25:09,581 --> 01:25:10,680
oh,
that's the guy steve pages.

2066
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:13,700
I'm telling you.
Steve pays a bad motherfucker.

2067
01:25:13,720 --> 01:25:16,330
No doubt about it.
But he's not the same guy.

2068
01:25:16,540 --> 01:25:18,610
That's not the brock lesnar guy.
Brock.

2069
01:25:18,650 --> 01:25:19,710
Nah,
they got.

2070
01:25:19,720 --> 01:25:21,220
Doesn't exist anymore.
Like I was tearing.

2071
01:25:21,290 --> 01:25:23,140
He did.
He would never lose.

2072
01:25:23,980 --> 01:25:25,480
Never ever lose.

2073
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:27,640
I was so scared because I was fine at 
that time.

2074
01:25:28,180 --> 01:25:28,570
I was like,
well,

2075
01:25:28,571 --> 01:25:31,540
what the fuck would happen?
What if they called me up right now?

2076
01:25:31,870 --> 01:25:33,370
I'm going to Have to act sick.
Yeah.

2077
01:25:33,371 --> 01:25:34,570
well,
yeah.

2078
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:35,440
it's interesting,
man.

2079
01:25:35,470 --> 01:25:40,470
That's,
that's not the people that saY that 

2080
01:25:40,470 --> 01:25:40,470
steroids don't win.
Fights are performance enhancing.

2081
01:25:40,470 --> 01:25:41,620
Drugs don't wIn fights.
They're crazy.

2082
01:25:42,460 --> 01:25:45,040
Those people are crazy.
Crazy.

2083
01:25:45,041 --> 01:25:46,620
You're out of your mind.
You're crazy.

2084
01:25:46,660 --> 01:25:51,660
Helps a lot.
You don't think I could have went uber 

2085
01:25:51,660 --> 01:25:51,660
brown,
uber big brown.

2086
01:25:51,660 --> 01:25:52,480
Oh yeah,
rondae brown.

2087
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:56,020
It helps a lot.
[inaudible] brown would do some work.

2088
01:25:56,050 --> 01:25:58,200
It also helps with your chair.
Yes,

2089
01:25:58,240 --> 01:26:01,180
and hopefully I could have taken that 
hah and my head would have grown,

2090
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:04,040
so all of a sudden I this ubering body

2091
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:06,140
and this Mark Hunt had.
That'd be fucking.

2092
01:26:07,180 --> 01:26:11,360
You know what I hope honestly,
I really do hope that rise and takes off

2093
01:26:11,361 --> 01:26:14,810
and becomes like pride was back in the 
day and you have these nutty,

2094
01:26:14,811 --> 01:26:19,811
insane fucking full bore freak show 
fights and we get to see guys just jack 

2095
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:23,210
sat in my life.
That'd be awesome.

2096
01:26:23,270 --> 01:26:27,010
We would do fucking pants.
So sick.

2097
01:26:27,020 --> 01:26:29,000
Fuck Yeah.
It'd be so violent.

2098
01:26:29,470 --> 01:26:31,130
It'd be amazing.
If ufc was smart,

2099
01:26:31,131 --> 01:26:33,050
they'd get in bed with them and be like,
listen,

2100
01:26:33,051 --> 01:26:38,051
let's put me under the table.
Investors bring this over to fucking 

2101
01:26:38,051 --> 01:26:38,051
fight pass.
Come on baby.

2102
01:26:38,051 --> 01:26:40,220
I agree.
Hey listen.

2103
01:26:40,310 --> 01:26:42,490
Ubering want start some shit.
How about you get your science?

2104
01:26:42,491 --> 01:26:44,540
And they'll put it on flight and 
encourage the steroids.

2105
01:26:44,570 --> 01:26:45,110
Say,
listen,

2106
01:26:45,111 --> 01:26:47,900
I know those motherfuckers kid can't 
fight like that over here.

2107
01:26:48,470 --> 01:26:50,830
We're all cleaning,
so listen,

2108
01:26:50,970 --> 01:26:52,700
just fucking give us a little taste.

2109
01:26:52,790 --> 01:26:54,810
It'd be a good business plan.
Yes.

2110
01:26:55,130 --> 01:26:56,300
Yeah,
you can watch the freak show.

2111
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:58,340
You get it.
Companies freak show you get it all.

2112
01:26:58,430 --> 01:26:59,360
And who knows?
Man.

2113
01:26:59,361 --> 01:27:00,530
Japan is weird.
You know,

2114
01:27:00,531 --> 01:27:03,710
Japan was a huge culture for mma at one 
point in time.

2115
01:27:03,980 --> 01:27:08,980
Like at one point in time the ufc was 
giant over there and then it faded and 

2116
01:27:08,980 --> 01:27:13,031
dropped off bat or excuse me,
a pride was giant and then it faded and 

2117
01:27:13,031 --> 01:27:17,111
dropped off.
Bad and dream was kind of like the end 

2118
01:27:17,111 --> 01:27:20,201
of it and then how there's not really a 
presence there anymore until rising 

2119
01:27:20,201 --> 01:27:24,230
comes along so verizon can figure out 
how to bring back the same sort of 

2120
01:27:24,230 --> 01:27:28,391
excitement in the japanese culture.
The japanese people that they had when 

2121
01:27:28,391 --> 01:27:30,860
they had the pride days,
the glory days of selling outside thomas

2122
01:27:30,861 --> 01:27:34,150
super arena and those gigantic places.
Then it gives it.

2123
01:27:34,150 --> 01:27:36,830
It'd be good business for them because 
then they just come in the back door and

2124
01:27:36,831 --> 01:27:37,030
like,
oh,

2125
01:27:37,031 --> 01:27:42,031
you liked that product.
what's the fellows to do it bigger and 

2126
01:27:42,031 --> 01:27:42,031
better than.
You know what I'm saying?

2127
01:27:42,031 --> 01:27:45,780
A little piece of the.
I wonder how the ufc did because didn't 

2128
01:27:45,780 --> 01:27:45,780
they do,
although foot,

2129
01:27:45,780 --> 01:27:46,550
uh,
someone out or not.

2130
01:27:46,551 --> 01:27:49,190
Although anthony pettis was the main 
event out there.

2131
01:27:49,191 --> 01:27:49,880
Remember?
Yeah,

2132
01:27:49,910 --> 01:27:51,340
I was there.
I was there for what?

2133
01:27:51,341 --> 01:27:53,720
A good show.
While there has been more than one.

2134
01:27:53,721 --> 01:27:54,860
Japan,
ufc.

2135
01:27:54,861 --> 01:27:56,970
I've been there for one of them,
but that was the bit load.

2136
01:27:57,260 --> 01:28:02,260
The latest one.
Remember rampage fought when I was 

2137
01:28:02,260 --> 01:28:02,260
there.
I remember that.

2138
01:28:02,260 --> 01:28:03,260
Um,
but I don't remember too much about that

2139
01:28:03,261 --> 01:28:05,480
event.
Mary pedis a pistol.

2140
01:28:05,580 --> 01:28:07,850
The main event and liver kick the shit 
out of her head.

2141
01:28:07,851 --> 01:28:10,120
Kicks on.
It might've been um,

2142
01:28:10,460 --> 01:28:11,100
joe lozano.

2143
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:16,120
Yes.
Maybe it was the car felt like roy was 

2144
01:28:16,120 --> 01:28:16,880
on there to myosin.
I don't remember that.

2145
01:28:16,881 --> 01:28:19,300
I wonder what the numbers were like.
They couldn't have been too great.

2146
01:28:19,301 --> 01:28:19,940
[inaudible] ufc.
It was like,

2147
01:28:19,941 --> 01:28:20,600
ah,
we're good.

2148
01:28:20,940 --> 01:28:25,940
No,
because they haven't been back in 

2149
01:28:25,940 --> 01:28:25,940
awhile.
I don't know.

2150
01:28:25,940 --> 01:28:25,940
I mean,
look,

2151
01:28:25,940 --> 01:28:27,920
the ufc does so many shows.
They're doing two next saturday.

2152
01:28:27,950 --> 01:28:31,850
They're doing one from Brazil and 
they're doing one from belfast.

2153
01:28:32,420 --> 01:28:33,080
Really?
Yeah.

2154
01:28:33,081 --> 01:28:38,081
They're doing the northern Ireland card 
is gay garden was saucy versus uriah 

2155
01:28:38,081 --> 01:28:38,120
hall.
The rematch.

2156
01:28:38,150 --> 01:28:39,050
It's fun.
Yeah,

2157
01:28:39,110 --> 01:28:44,110
and then the Brazil card is ryan bader 
versus little nog and claudia kadesia on

2158
01:28:46,280 --> 01:28:48,670
that car to.
And there's one more big fight on this.

2159
01:28:48,750 --> 01:28:53,750
Here's someone that no one's talking 
about in the strawweight division is 

2160
01:28:53,750 --> 01:28:54,290
jessica on drudge.
She moved down.

2161
01:28:54,710 --> 01:28:56,390
She's a girl,
a gorilla.

2162
01:28:56,510 --> 01:29:01,510
She,
her and liz carmouche that a 

2163
01:29:01,510 --> 01:29:01,510
bodybuilding contest to stand in front 
of each other.

2164
01:29:01,510 --> 01:29:03,780
Flex it out.
I'll tell you.

2165
01:29:03,781 --> 01:29:08,781
I'll tell you,
I wouldn't mind seeing signed with the 

2166
01:29:08,781 --> 01:29:08,781
ufc and I don't think she needs to work 
on a stand up.

2167
01:29:08,781 --> 01:29:11,600
Obviously it's super amped right now,
but that mckenzie.

2168
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:13,000
Oh yeah.
Is she?

2169
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:16,350
I watched her,
I think it was on a hd net.

2170
01:29:16,710 --> 01:29:21,710
She plucking nodded this girl up and I 
think it was a gogo plot and then she 

2171
01:29:22,321 --> 01:29:27,321
got.
She started a gogo plata and then got 

2172
01:29:27,321 --> 01:29:27,450
her neck.
Her grappling,

2173
01:29:27,510 --> 01:29:30,600
I think she could come into the ufc 
right now it's straw weight and just top

2174
01:29:30,601 --> 01:29:33,080
five.
She was saying her jujitsu's insane.

2175
01:29:33,081 --> 01:29:35,460
It's so insane.
Hurt her striking super amateur.

2176
01:29:35,461 --> 01:29:40,461
But the straw weight divisions at a 
point where I think she could still do 

2177
01:29:40,461 --> 01:29:43,080
work right now and she's hot as fuck.
She is a smoke shop.

2178
01:29:43,110 --> 01:29:46,950
She's a smoke show and she speaks 
english and portuguese fluently.

2179
01:29:47,490 --> 01:29:51,720
Dime pc and nasty on the ground.
Nasty when st.

2180
01:29:51,750 --> 01:29:56,190
Super high level black belt.
Then the daughter of megaton diaz?

2181
01:29:56,280 --> 01:29:57,750
Yes.
Who's a very,

2182
01:29:57,751 --> 01:30:02,751
very well respected,
famous presented jitsu black belt and a 

2183
01:30:02,751 --> 01:30:03,360
pioneer.
He's one of the old school guys.

2184
01:30:03,361 --> 01:30:04,400
That's her papa.
Yeah.

2185
01:30:04,401 --> 01:30:05,520
That's amazing.
Yeah.

2186
01:30:05,521 --> 01:30:06,140
She,
yeah.

2187
01:30:06,270 --> 01:30:08,520
I think she's probably eventually gonna 
wind up in the ufc.

2188
01:30:08,620 --> 01:30:10,990
Oh yeah,
yeah.

2189
01:30:11,730 --> 01:30:14,520
Yeah.
Good luck taking down the polish killer.

2190
01:30:14,521 --> 01:30:19,521
Did you see the,
what she put on her fucking water 

2191
01:30:19,521 --> 01:30:19,521
bottle,
bro?

2192
01:30:19,521 --> 01:30:19,560
yeah.
If somebody killer shit.

2193
01:30:19,590 --> 01:30:24,590
One of the guys from the underground 
posted it up and then I actually wound 

2194
01:30:24,590 --> 01:30:25,740
up getting it from um,
Joe Silva.

2195
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:28,440
Joe silva showed it to me in between 
fights.

2196
01:30:28,890 --> 01:30:31,740
It's um.
let me see the dude's name especially in

2197
01:30:31,830 --> 01:30:34,950
cognito is the dude's name on mixed 
martial arts.com.

2198
01:30:35,250 --> 01:30:40,250
And it says in two days I will fuck a 
bitch up and continue my violent run as 

2199
01:30:40,351 --> 01:30:41,010
champion.

2200
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:45,450
She writes that her water bottle just 
straight,

2201
01:30:46,020 --> 01:30:49,110
cold blooded killer.
I love her.

2202
01:30:49,111 --> 01:30:54,111
But how much that fight?
I was surprised the first time we've 

2203
01:30:54,111 --> 01:30:54,111
really seen her in a lot of trouble.
Like that.

2204
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:55,800
She got crack.
Thing was a punch.

2205
01:30:55,830 --> 01:30:58,300
It was a straight punch.
She got hit by that punch.

2206
01:30:58,320 --> 01:31:03,320
The elbow like she,
she punched and came through with that 

2207
01:31:03,320 --> 01:31:03,320
right elbow.
And then she was wobbly.

2208
01:31:03,320 --> 01:31:07,761
Man.
Maybe you've never really seen her in 

2209
01:31:07,761 --> 01:31:07,761
that much danger.
You well.

2210
01:31:07,761 --> 01:31:11,210
And the thing was a shift.
Chanko was getting lit up for most of 

2211
01:31:11,210 --> 01:31:12,480
the fights.
She's super tough.

2212
01:31:12,830 --> 01:31:16,800
Those polish move tough.
And after the fight look great.

2213
01:31:16,830 --> 01:31:18,900
I mean she had a lot of punches.
She had a lot of kicks.

2214
01:31:19,190 --> 01:31:24,190
Leg kicks,
ilana looked worse as far as face had 

2215
01:31:24,190 --> 01:31:26,200
that big mouth on her upper.
Either she got cracked with.

2216
01:31:27,290 --> 01:31:29,610
I think there was a couple of hard 
elbows in the clench too.

2217
01:31:29,820 --> 01:31:32,690
It was a great fight,
but it wasn't a great fight for awhile.

2218
01:31:32,700 --> 01:31:36,030
For awhile.
It was like it looked like valentino was

2219
01:31:36,031 --> 01:31:39,560
just.
She just wasn't as fluid or effective.

2220
01:31:39,680 --> 01:31:40,950
yes,
she was just hanging in there.

2221
01:31:41,100 --> 01:31:43,440
She never stopped.
She never stopped coming forward.

2222
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:47,340
She never stopped coming forward and she
was never discouraged.

2223
01:31:47,780 --> 01:31:51,450
I mean she had some moments where she 
couldn't solve the puzzle and you want.

2224
01:31:51,451 --> 01:31:56,451
It was doing a really good job of ending
the combinations with leg kicks inside 

2225
01:31:56,451 --> 01:31:57,730
and outside.
Inside announcing stop.

2226
01:31:58,280 --> 01:31:59,620
Yeah.
Yeah.

2227
01:31:59,640 --> 01:32:01,510
And all those leg kicks were there.
There was.

2228
01:32:01,550 --> 01:32:03,250
There was really making a big 
difference.

2229
01:32:03,570 --> 01:32:05,010
Yeah.
If you follow you on it though,

2230
01:32:05,020 --> 01:32:06,250
that,
that it was a,

2231
01:32:06,340 --> 01:32:11,340
it was a tough fight beyond definitely 
one that she said like her first fight 

2232
01:32:11,340 --> 01:32:13,900
with claudia kadesia.
That's how's the tougher fight for her.

2233
01:32:13,970 --> 01:32:15,560
She had a tough fight in the last one 
with claudia.

2234
01:32:15,590 --> 01:32:17,950
Dahlia,
one really short one,

2235
01:32:17,951 --> 01:32:19,700
but yeah,
she's been to some wars.

2236
01:32:20,500 --> 01:32:22,570
Valerie letourneau.
She fought that fight.

2237
01:32:22,571 --> 01:32:24,340
She had a broken hand somewhere in the 
fight.

2238
01:32:24,341 --> 01:32:26,260
She kept punching with it.
She's just a murder,

2239
01:32:26,270 --> 01:32:27,760
a man.
She's a bad ass woman.

2240
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:30,130
It's as bad as tony hinchcliffe still 
obsessed with her.

2241
01:32:30,131 --> 01:32:32,500
Loves her.
Like brother and sister though,

2242
01:32:32,501 --> 01:32:33,050
don't they?
Yeah.

2243
01:32:33,060 --> 01:32:34,150
It would be weird if they fucked.

2244
01:32:37,290 --> 01:32:40,420
She might not weigh him.
That's a tough one.

2245
01:32:40,421 --> 01:32:42,280
She's not cutting weight.
That's a tough one,

2246
01:32:42,281 --> 01:32:42,930
you know?
Yes.

2247
01:32:42,950 --> 01:32:45,610
She definitely beat his ass.
He admitted that he was like,

2248
01:32:45,620 --> 01:32:47,080
you know it your ass.
Right.

2249
01:32:48,280 --> 01:32:50,060
Mr.
Put her hands on your right.

2250
01:32:51,370 --> 01:32:53,050
He loves her man.
She's a killer.

2251
01:32:53,590 --> 01:32:55,750
Killer.
That was a long ass card though.

2252
01:32:55,980 --> 01:32:58,120
And what I was watching on the east 
coast in Florida.

2253
01:32:58,360 --> 01:33:00,150
Dude,
the cards get done late there.

2254
01:33:00,151 --> 01:33:03,010
It's like 1:00
AM by the time connor was walking out.

2255
01:33:03,011 --> 01:33:03,670
Yeah.
Yeah.

2256
01:33:03,730 --> 01:33:05,800
Jamie was there.
We couldn't get somewhere to eat.

2257
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:10,330
We try to get into the first restaurant 
is goddamn packed at 2:00,

2258
01:33:10,331 --> 01:33:11,200
2:30
in the morning.

2259
01:33:11,201 --> 01:33:14,260
We wound up at katz's deli because 
katz's deli is 24 slash seven.

2260
01:33:14,900 --> 01:33:16,180
We.
It was hard to find food.

2261
01:33:16,181 --> 01:33:18,610
It was mobbed.
I can't remember where his mom crazy.

2262
01:33:18,611 --> 01:33:20,290
How late it got done for these guys.

2263
01:33:20,290 --> 01:33:24,250
Will New York is different.
New york bars stay open I think till for

2264
01:33:24,700 --> 01:33:28,480
florida's till five.
Did you know that Florida was crap?

2265
01:33:28,510 --> 01:33:33,510
Florida was popping like everything was 
great and I was exhausted going man,

2266
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,240
two hours of sleep and got on a plane.
I was exhausted.

2267
01:33:36,241 --> 01:33:41,241
And then yeah,
especially if you're in southern 

2268
01:33:41,241 --> 01:33:42,721
Florida.
Southern Florida is ridiculous where 

2269
01:33:42,721 --> 01:33:44,470
we're at and then it's like that.
And then with the time change in la,

2270
01:33:44,471 --> 01:33:45,670
you know,
you just all messed up.

2271
01:33:45,730 --> 01:33:50,730
But that's why sports like in football,
but like the heisman voting and stuff 

2272
01:33:50,951 --> 01:33:54,400
like that on these coasts,
it's so late you're like,

2273
01:33:54,401 --> 01:33:56,050
well I don't see a lot of it,
you know,

2274
01:33:56,170 --> 01:34:01,170
or they don't see a lot of the monday 
night football or college games because 

2275
01:34:01,170 --> 01:34:02,170
it's just so damn late.
Feel lIke there's a better route to go.

2276
01:34:02,550 --> 01:34:03,400
Uh,
nope.

2277
01:34:03,930 --> 01:34:05,740
That do it if it was right.

2278
01:34:05,740 --> 01:34:10,740
yeah.
Though the east coast doesn't mind 

2279
01:34:10,740 --> 01:34:10,740
staying up late and the west coast 
demands at beyond their schedule.

2280
01:34:10,870 --> 01:34:15,870
So it winds up starting at seven and 
more people that's filmed things out 

2281
01:34:15,881 --> 01:34:16,980
here.
Get points or.

2282
01:34:17,380 --> 01:34:18,560
yeah.
And if they did it on the,

2283
01:34:18,630 --> 01:34:20,790
the west coast of the east coast 
schedule,

2284
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:22,450
it happened too early.
You would lose money.

2285
01:34:22,690 --> 01:34:25,510
Like if you had a show at five,
people are not done working,

2286
01:34:25,511 --> 01:34:28,120
like people have to work on saturday.
They're still at work.

2287
01:34:28,270 --> 01:34:30,130
It's true.
So it can't be at four,

2288
01:34:30,190 --> 01:34:32,170
which would be,
if it was their time,

2289
01:34:32,230 --> 01:34:34,030
our time was 7:00
PM.

2290
01:34:34,180 --> 01:34:37,150
And then also you also have to think 
about the undercard.

2291
01:34:37,270 --> 01:34:39,700
What if somebody wants to watch the 
undercard on fs?

2292
01:34:39,701 --> 01:34:44,701
One,
you're not going to pay for the 

2293
01:34:44,701 --> 01:34:44,701
undercard fs.
One is going to be,

2294
01:34:44,701 --> 01:34:47,341
hey listen bitch,
you can't put the undercard on a 10 in 

2295
01:34:47,341 --> 01:34:47,341
the morning.

2296
01:34:47,341 --> 01:34:47,341
Nobody wants to watch that shit.
Done it.

2297
01:34:47,341 --> 01:34:48,330
Well,
you know when they're in Brazil,

2298
01:34:48,340 --> 01:34:49,960
it's actually like that,
but they'll get mad.

2299
01:34:49,961 --> 01:34:50,950
People get mad.
It's true.

2300
01:34:51,080 --> 01:34:52,990
You're going to get the mass audience is
obviously working.

2301
01:34:53,320 --> 01:34:54,610
Yeah.
And these coasts stays up.

2302
01:34:54,760 --> 01:34:55,690
They always stay up,
dude.

2303
01:34:55,691 --> 01:34:58,520
How crazy that matt square garden and 
after the fight,

2304
01:34:58,970 --> 01:35:01,700
the lights on the state in which they've
never done before in the arena,

2305
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:05,540
we're irish colors.
It was pretty intense.

2306
01:35:06,670 --> 01:35:08,870
Do you,
and brian and I were arguing this,

2307
01:35:08,871 --> 01:35:12,680
do you think conor mcgregor is more well
known than floyd mayweather?

2308
01:35:13,880 --> 01:35:15,110
Currently?
Yes.

2309
01:35:16,500 --> 01:35:18,560
Yeah.
boston's a bigger sport.

2310
01:35:18,590 --> 01:35:20,240
Yeah,
because you look at,

2311
01:35:20,570 --> 01:35:21,740
you look at floyd.
Manny,

2312
01:35:21,741 --> 01:35:25,460
like the patriot numbers destroys 
anything cottage or been close to.

2313
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:27,200
That's true.
Maybe not.

2314
01:35:27,530 --> 01:35:28,110
Maybe.
No.

2315
01:35:28,650 --> 01:35:30,230
I was arguing.
Connor is bigger.

2316
01:35:30,520 --> 01:35:32,030
He can social media,
stuff like that.

2317
01:35:32,240 --> 01:35:35,210
But floyd has more followers and and on 
instagram,

2318
01:35:35,211 --> 01:35:35,430
twitter.

2319
01:35:35,460 --> 01:35:37,010
You can't judge it off that.
Here's the thing,

2320
01:35:37,011 --> 01:35:42,011
the amount of excitement that floyd 
generates does not even fucking compare 

2321
01:35:42,011 --> 01:35:42,940
to the amount of excitement that connor 
generates.

2322
01:35:42,950 --> 01:35:44,600
It doesn't mean he's more popular.
Understand,

2323
01:35:44,690 --> 01:35:47,360
but it does kinda because the intensity 
of the popularity.

2324
01:35:47,361 --> 01:35:52,361
The law.
People might know who floyd made with 

2325
01:35:52,361 --> 01:35:54,531
her as,
but when it comes to how many people 

2326
01:35:54,531 --> 01:35:54,531
love floyd mayweather.
It's not even close.

2327
01:35:54,531 --> 01:35:59,170
He might be like some ridiculous tend to
one or 20 to one because when connor 

2328
01:35:59,170 --> 01:36:01,220
gets out there they go fucking crazy.
Crazy.

2329
01:36:01,221 --> 01:36:03,560
How many people were there to see floyd 
mayweather lose?

2330
01:36:03,740 --> 01:36:08,740
How many people were bored after floyd 
mayweather fights like ford mayor with 

2331
01:36:08,740 --> 01:36:12,301
their fights so skillfully and 
surgically that and doesn't take any 

2332
01:36:12,301 --> 01:36:12,301
chances,
so hardly ever gets hit.

2333
01:36:12,301 --> 01:36:16,810
It's not connor merck's motherfuckers.
He wins the world title in the fastest 

2334
01:36:16,810 --> 01:36:17,510
ever title,
winning knockout ever.

2335
01:36:17,660 --> 01:36:22,660
What did you do after that?
He comes back and makes eddie alvarez 

2336
01:36:22,660 --> 01:36:22,660
looked like eddie alvarez world 
champion.

2337
01:36:22,660 --> 01:36:27,460
The guy was,
he's defending delmar hall of famer and 

2338
01:36:27,460 --> 01:36:28,430
connor makes him look like he has no 
business in there with them.

2339
01:36:28,460 --> 01:36:31,520
No business has zero success at all 
except for a couple of body shots.

2340
01:36:31,580 --> 01:36:36,580
This is why I think connor's bigger and 
more trend descent because he just 

2341
01:36:36,831 --> 01:36:37,880
bailed on that word.
I did.

2342
01:36:37,980 --> 01:36:38,850
Sorry.
transcendent,

2343
01:36:38,900 --> 01:36:41,270
transcendent be because I just bailed,
right?

2344
01:36:41,271 --> 01:36:44,870
Just fucking out like that.
I like.

2345
01:36:45,330 --> 01:36:50,330
I think I'm using it wrong and go and 
operation he jacked,

2346
01:36:52,340 --> 01:36:57,340
but how many successful black athletes 
do we know of?

2347
01:36:57,440 --> 01:37:02,440
Joe galen?
How many white irish superstars do we 

2348
01:37:02,440 --> 01:37:02,440
know?
One?

2349
01:37:02,440 --> 01:37:03,050
Yeah.
One.

2350
01:37:03,080 --> 01:37:07,430
One weekend was a big star before he 
came to the United States and he came to

2351
01:37:07,431 --> 01:37:09,820
the United States and eventually lost 
his belt,

2352
01:37:09,821 --> 01:37:13,100
but barry mcguigan at one point in time 
was a huge star,

2353
01:37:13,130 --> 01:37:17,090
but nowhere near to door that comes in 
in,

2354
01:37:17,190 --> 01:37:17,550
in.

2355
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:21,290
This goes for all athletes.
Conners the green elephant in the room.

2356
01:37:21,320 --> 01:37:23,140
everyone else we've seen before,
every once we,

2357
01:37:23,330 --> 01:37:28,330
we know what they can kind of do,
connors this green elephant amongst all 

2358
01:37:28,330 --> 01:37:29,150
these gray elephants and there's nothing
like him.

2359
01:37:29,300 --> 01:37:30,920
Totally different.
Totally different animal.

2360
01:37:31,130 --> 01:37:33,620
It's crazy.
He's elephant with two fucking trunks to

2361
01:37:33,720 --> 01:37:38,030
15.
Dick's gold with a leprechaun outfit.

2362
01:37:38,060 --> 01:37:43,060
Correct.
And now he has a little son on the way 

2363
01:37:43,060 --> 01:37:43,340
and they gave him a fucking rolls royce 
with his face on it.

2364
01:37:43,490 --> 01:37:48,490
How crazy is that?
What's interesting is how well he 

2365
01:37:48,490 --> 01:37:48,710
manages at all.
It's really interesting.

2366
01:37:49,010 --> 01:37:51,050
You know,
like the pressure in particular,

2367
01:37:51,051 --> 01:37:52,430
he doesn't seem to have a problem with 
it at all.

2368
01:37:52,431 --> 01:37:55,560
It's weird.
That's what makes him so special because

2369
01:37:55,620 --> 01:38:00,620
that magnitude and the pressure and he 
has to deliver and he has to do those 

2370
01:38:00,620 --> 01:38:00,750
antics and then back it up.

2371
01:38:01,050 --> 01:38:03,610
But he keeps pulling it off like you at 
the breast.

2372
01:38:03,680 --> 01:38:04,200
I was like,
right,

2373
01:38:04,201 --> 01:38:06,510
this is stupid and this getting old to 
me.

2374
01:38:06,750 --> 01:38:07,770
But then when he pulls off,
I'm like,

2375
01:38:07,771 --> 01:38:09,580
that was brilliant.
And you know,

2376
01:38:09,750 --> 01:38:11,820
I mean the guy steps in,
he loses the ds,

2377
01:38:11,821 --> 01:38:13,560
right?
It takes the diaz fight on short notice.

2378
01:38:13,630 --> 01:38:15,420
By the way,
after a staph infection,

2379
01:38:15,780 --> 01:38:17,070
here's something that a lot of people 
don't even know.

2380
01:38:17,300 --> 01:38:22,300
He had a pretty significant staph 
infection was on antibiotics until like 

2381
01:38:22,300 --> 01:38:25,700
two weeks before the fight.
If you don't think that drains your gas 

2382
01:38:25,700 --> 01:38:28,311
tank,
he never had a staph infection and you 

2383
01:38:28,311 --> 01:38:28,311
never had to take antibiotics.
Antibiotics are brutal on your,

2384
01:38:28,311 --> 01:38:31,110
on your respiratory system.
They're brutal on your whole body.

2385
01:38:31,111 --> 01:38:36,111
It's Just your body up.
Your body's made up of all this shit 

2386
01:38:36,111 --> 01:38:37,740
that you don't consider to be you,
but it is you.

2387
01:38:37,880 --> 01:38:42,880
Stomach flora is a real part of you.
You know your body is essentially like 

2388
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:44,610
an ecosystem and when you have a staph 
infection,

2389
01:38:44,700 --> 01:38:47,940
staph infections are dangerous as fuck 
and people die from them.

2390
01:38:47,990 --> 01:38:50,910
You're so they hit you with some heavy 
duty antibiotics.

2391
01:38:50,911 --> 01:38:55,911
I've had staff twice and it's not fun,
and the first time I had it and I took 

2392
01:38:55,911 --> 01:38:59,490
the medication,
I couldn't believe how I felt so weird.

2393
01:38:59,491 --> 01:39:01,650
I felt light headed.
I felt weak.

2394
01:39:01,651 --> 01:39:02,400
I was like,
whoa,

2395
01:39:02,401 --> 01:39:03,480
I can drain.
Right?

2396
01:39:03,570 --> 01:39:06,300
You have no energy.
Super strong stuff too.

2397
01:39:06,510 --> 01:39:07,170
And I was like,
wow,

2398
01:39:07,171 --> 01:39:09,830
imagine this guy fighting two weeks 
after that saying,

2399
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:11,340
because there's no way you pete 
correctly.

2400
01:39:11,400 --> 01:39:13,770
No.
so he comes from that and then he fights

2401
01:39:13,860 --> 01:39:16,530
nate again,
you know,

2402
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:21,560
few months later in a fucking crazy five
round war and beat them by the narrowest

2403
01:39:21,691 --> 01:39:22,590
of margins.
Right.

2404
01:39:22,770 --> 01:39:23,340
Don't you agree?

2405
01:39:23,550 --> 01:39:25,440
Yeah.
That was very,

2406
01:39:25,490 --> 01:39:27,900
very close fight where some people 
thought that nate one,

2407
01:39:28,540 --> 01:39:32,580
I mean very good.
But I thoUght the decision was correct,

2408
01:39:32,850 --> 01:39:33,570
but it was like,
wow,

2409
01:39:33,571 --> 01:39:36,390
that's close Fight.
So takes that fuCking crazy chance.

2410
01:39:36,391 --> 01:39:37,650
Comes back at fights.
That guy,

2411
01:39:37,800 --> 01:39:42,800
he kinda weighed one 69.
That's what he weighed when he weighed 

2412
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:42,800
in.
That's what he weighed during the fight.

2413
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:43,620
And they,
they want them to fight at 55.

2414
01:39:43,621 --> 01:39:43,990
He goes,
no,

2415
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:44,160
no,
no.

2416
01:39:44,161 --> 01:39:45,660
I can be with seven.
Let me do 70.

2417
01:39:45,750 --> 01:39:48,510
Nate wade.
Probably around one 90 something.

2418
01:39:48,511 --> 01:39:49,350
Yeah,
I mean did,

2419
01:39:49,380 --> 01:39:51,900
I mean everybody says that nate is a 155
pounder.

2420
01:39:51,901 --> 01:39:56,901
He is 100 percent,
but he's away bigger man and been then 

2421
01:39:56,901 --> 01:39:58,080
connor is,
he just is,

2422
01:39:58,170 --> 01:40:03,170
you know,
so it's like who's going to way more 

2423
01:40:03,170 --> 01:40:05,541
when they actually get in there and 
nate's gonna weigh more so he does that 

2424
01:40:05,541 --> 01:40:08,070
and then goes from there and just say 
starches.

2425
01:40:08,070 --> 01:40:13,070
Eddie alvarez like a world beater and 
just so relaxed and loose in there.

2426
01:40:14,520 --> 01:40:16,980
So amazing.
Fucking madonna was at the show.

2427
01:40:17,160 --> 01:40:20,100
Madonna was done.
Show mcdonald's at the fights.

2428
01:40:20,460 --> 01:40:22,800
How crazy is that?
Mcdonald's instagramming mama.

2429
01:40:22,801 --> 01:40:26,130
We made it mama.
We made it red penny night.

2430
01:40:26,190 --> 01:40:29,970
It's red penny and I and madonna europe 
thinks she's single.

2431
01:40:30,050 --> 01:40:34,880
Where the fuck is my second belt?
I envisioned this with a focus me nuts,

2432
01:40:34,920 --> 01:40:36,960
man.
It's fucking character,

2433
01:40:37,110 --> 01:40:38,340
man.
He's such a character.

2434
01:40:39,060 --> 01:40:40,200
And,
and you know,

2435
01:40:40,350 --> 01:40:41,730
I thought he was gonna make a big 
announcement.

2436
01:40:41,731 --> 01:40:43,710
I thought it was announcement was he's 
going to retire,

2437
01:40:44,280 --> 01:40:47,040
but his nephew was like a,
if I'm going to continue doing this,

2438
01:40:47,041 --> 01:40:49,380
you guys need to.
I need a share of the company.

2439
01:40:49,620 --> 01:40:54,620
Yeah.
That's probably what the announcement 

2440
01:40:54,620 --> 01:40:56,240
was going to be all along.
You know that he wants a piece of the 

2441
01:40:56,240 --> 01:40:56,240
pie.

2442
01:40:56,240 --> 01:40:59,130
I mean he's got an argument that he 
probably should get a percentage of the 

2443
01:40:59,130 --> 01:41:03,721
promotion because the,
what they're selling is conor mcgregor 

2444
01:41:03,721 --> 01:41:04,180
or selling the ufc,
plus conor mcgregor.

2445
01:41:04,520 --> 01:41:06,850
The question is,
how much of that card,

2446
01:41:07,300 --> 01:41:09,030
what would it be?
What would the paper.

2447
01:41:09,130 --> 01:41:14,130
We don't know what the numbers are,
so let's pretend the number is 2 

2448
01:41:14,130 --> 01:41:17,550
million,
which would be like the greatest of all 

2449
01:41:17,550 --> 01:41:17,550
time,
right?

2450
01:41:17,550 --> 01:41:17,550
It probably wouldn't hit that.
I don't know.

2451
01:41:17,550 --> 01:41:21,590
I bet it's thrown on one seven.
Let's just say 2 million because it's 

2452
01:41:21,590 --> 01:41:23,470
easy to correct.
So let's say that what percentage bought

2453
01:41:23,471 --> 01:41:26,050
It because of connor,
It might be a million 1 million plus for

2454
01:41:26,051 --> 01:41:27,350
sure.
It might be 1 million,

2455
01:41:28,510 --> 01:41:33,510
1 million,
1 million people might have bought the 

2456
01:41:33,510 --> 01:41:33,970
paper view specifically because of one 
human being.

2457
01:41:34,240 --> 01:41:39,240
That is not outrageous to say and.
But this is the other thing in connor's 

2458
01:41:39,240 --> 01:41:41,020
favorite name,
another star who can do that?

2459
01:41:41,500 --> 01:41:43,930
Rhonda can't quite do that.
she can't quite do it.

2460
01:41:43,990 --> 01:41:47,140
She and she's talking about this might 
be my last fight,

2461
01:41:47,141 --> 01:41:49,390
blah blah blah.
So I don't think she said that.

2462
01:41:49,420 --> 01:41:53,050
I think she said she's close to you.
Which when you hear that.

2463
01:41:53,190 --> 01:41:54,030
Yeah,
thank you.

2464
01:41:54,031 --> 01:41:57,490
It's talking about having one foot out.
So let's say she has two fights left,

2465
01:41:58,120 --> 01:41:59,380
maybe three,
who knows,

2466
01:41:59,381 --> 01:42:01,300
but she's not the same draw as connor.
It's just not.

2467
01:42:01,390 --> 01:42:03,710
It's just you look at the number.
She's not the same job,

2468
01:42:04,420 --> 01:42:07,900
but if she comes back beats and Amanda 
Nunez,

2469
01:42:07,990 --> 01:42:10,090
armbars and then fights board and then 
fights.

2470
01:42:10,091 --> 01:42:14,110
Holly beats beats holly gets a rematch.
Arm barcelona's biggest counter.

2471
01:42:14,590 --> 01:42:18,480
You don't know that because as that 
happened to mr joe rody.

2472
01:42:18,520 --> 01:42:20,380
But here's the thing,
as these people,

2473
01:42:20,381 --> 01:42:24,040
when they're star gets more and more 
giant as rhonda,

2474
01:42:24,090 --> 01:42:25,930
if rhonda came back and started winning 
again,

2475
01:42:26,080 --> 01:42:28,090
her star would get more and more giant.

2476
01:42:28,090 --> 01:42:31,540
It would get bigger with fuel more.
The more bodies she claims,

2477
01:42:31,541 --> 01:42:34,840
the more fuel for her fire will have.
That is what happens all the time.

2478
01:42:35,020 --> 01:42:40,020
It means pure speculaTion,
but when the way connor has been 

2479
01:42:40,020 --> 01:42:43,441
winning,
she can win in spectacular fashion or 

2480
01:42:43,441 --> 01:42:43,900
the way she was winning.
When she fucked up Alexis Davis and sara

2481
01:42:43,901 --> 01:42:45,490
mcmann,
merck and girls merck,

2482
01:42:45,510 --> 01:42:49,300
and then she custom 1:15
she couldn't ever make,

2483
01:42:49,301 --> 01:42:52,030
but you know saying fuck no,
why not?

2484
01:42:52,530 --> 01:42:53,830
She's,
she's way too big,

2485
01:42:54,130 --> 01:42:55,810
but is she okay?
That'D be,

2486
01:42:56,070 --> 01:42:56,700
I mean,
yeah,

2487
01:42:56,701 --> 01:43:01,701
beCause she lives really,
really rushed away and sometimes people 

2488
01:43:01,701 --> 01:43:01,701
that ain't.
That's.

2489
01:43:01,701 --> 01:43:03,080
This is nothing.
But um,

2490
01:43:03,960 --> 01:43:07,170
if for concert and this,
and again I'm not rooting for favorites,

2491
01:43:07,240 --> 01:43:09,310
I'm just saying from business standpoint
for connor,

2492
01:43:09,311 --> 01:43:10,650
he's such a big draw,
right?

2493
01:43:11,050 --> 01:43:12,940
What's going to help him in this 
negotiating power?

2494
01:43:12,941 --> 01:43:15,430
If rhonda worked her lose this next 
fight because then he's like,

2495
01:43:15,640 --> 01:43:16,900
I'm the only motherfucker in town.

2496
01:43:17,200 --> 01:43:19,360
You guys were claiming me and rhonda.
That's cool.

2497
01:43:19,420 --> 01:43:21,460
She just lost.
I need my fucking money.

2498
01:43:21,500 --> 01:43:22,390
Well,
and by the way,

2499
01:43:22,391 --> 01:43:24,580
rhonda has a tough fight in front of 
her.

2500
01:43:24,581 --> 01:43:27,850
Amanda nunez is god damn scary.
She's scary girl.

2501
01:43:27,880 --> 01:43:30,970
As I was saying before,
ronda lost a holly.

2502
01:43:31,030 --> 01:43:33,190
I was saying she should have got the 
title fight and I said,

2503
01:43:33,220 --> 01:43:35,030
I said that I think she's the most 
dangerous one.

2504
01:43:35,031 --> 01:43:37,630
And I was talking shit to you.
The way she stopped sara mcmann,

2505
01:43:37,631 --> 01:43:40,630
she cracks with that right hand.
She hits like a truck.

2506
01:43:40,640 --> 01:43:42,640
He hits like a dude,
but she.

2507
01:43:42,700 --> 01:43:44,290
well,
cyborg hits like a dude.

2508
01:43:44,291 --> 01:43:46,540
Amanda hits like a strong girl.
Big difference.

2509
01:43:47,290 --> 01:43:52,290
A board like tyrone woodley with let's 
be real.

2510
01:43:53,901 --> 01:43:58,901
She hits so hard and gets no love 
because she's so god damn scary and 

2511
01:43:58,901 --> 01:44:02,711
can't make the weight.
She also has a a better arsenal like 

2512
01:44:02,711 --> 01:44:03,860
shelter,
kicks and knees on the ground.

2513
01:44:03,870 --> 01:44:05,870
I think amanda,
amanda,

2514
01:44:05,960 --> 01:44:10,960
but amanda has lost on the ground before
she got beat up by cats and gone on the 

2515
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:11,630
ground.
Correct cyber.

2516
01:44:11,930 --> 01:44:16,930
Grip your limbs off,
but she's getting no love but she's too 

2517
01:44:16,930 --> 01:44:16,930
big.
I know.

2518
01:44:16,930 --> 01:44:21,710
It sucks.
They were well and again if they did 

2519
01:44:22,251 --> 01:44:24,590
that whole thing where I'm talking aBout
they eliminated weight cuts,

2520
01:44:24,591 --> 01:44:26,360
so it'd be two girls cyborg with 
fighter,

2521
01:44:26,361 --> 01:44:28,820
like one 80,
one 80.

2522
01:44:28,840 --> 01:44:31,160
It'd be.
It'd be her and that big ass girl.

2523
01:44:31,190 --> 01:44:34,780
Gabby gets to 80,
but that's all we got for.

2524
01:44:34,781 --> 01:44:37,400
You would have to cut weight to me when 
we fight every other weekend,

2525
01:44:38,110 --> 01:44:43,110
like tim silvia and andre arlovski.
Let's do that every other weekend or a 

2526
01:44:43,110 --> 01:44:47,960
fight.
Let them fight like every other weekend 

2527
01:44:47,960 --> 01:44:48,680
because all we had in the old days.
But uh,

2528
01:44:48,870 --> 01:44:50,600
I,
I think for rhonda,

2529
01:44:50,750 --> 01:44:52,730
Amanda Nunez,
fight stylists getting can.

2530
01:44:52,731 --> 01:44:53,260
We don't know.

2531
01:44:53,280 --> 01:44:56,420
We don't know where rhonda is a mental 
state.

2532
01:44:56,421 --> 01:45:01,421
Is that.
But stylists gates a great matchup for 

2533
01:45:01,421 --> 01:45:01,421
rhonda?
I think so,

2534
01:45:01,421 --> 01:45:02,030
yeah.
I think if she comes ready prepared as a

2535
01:45:02,031 --> 01:45:03,050
good camp,
she mercer,

2536
01:45:03,230 --> 01:45:06,640
but don't you think that you look at the
way she fucked up me should take eagle.

2537
01:45:06,641 --> 01:45:09,260
Like that girl presents a lot of danger 
with those punches.

2538
01:45:09,350 --> 01:45:11,540
Especially considering what happened 
with holly and ronda.

2539
01:45:11,960 --> 01:45:12,800
Yeah.
But yeah,

2540
01:45:12,980 --> 01:45:15,470
I think she presents A lot of danes 
shoot 100 percent.

2541
01:45:15,471 --> 01:45:16,490
Joe.
I think you're right in that,

2542
01:45:16,491 --> 01:45:21,491
but I think her marching forward is the 
Perfect antidote to get marked by rhonda

2543
01:45:21,800 --> 01:45:22,460
because she's like,
oh,

2544
01:45:22,461 --> 01:45:26,180
come get some of this judo armbars if 
she marches forward,

2545
01:45:26,420 --> 01:45:29,240
which is really all she knows how to do.
You know what I'm saying?

2546
01:45:29,800 --> 01:45:31,730
Could it be interesting?
It's a great fight either way,

2547
01:45:31,790 --> 01:45:36,790
but it's also interesting to see what 
we're rhonda his head is now she's 

2548
01:45:36,790 --> 01:45:36,790
coming back to the x factor because if 
it's wrong,

2549
01:45:36,790 --> 01:45:37,830
100 percent,
she beats her.

2550
01:45:37,850 --> 01:45:40,090
I think nine out of 10 times strong 
words it.

2551
01:45:40,091 --> 01:45:41,810
I know,
but if it's rhonda who's kinda,

2552
01:45:42,020 --> 01:45:43,160
oh,
I want to do movies,

2553
01:45:43,161 --> 01:45:44,750
I don't do this,
this isn't for me.

2554
01:45:44,840 --> 01:45:46,820
You're going to get marked because that 
girl hit so hard.

2555
01:45:46,910 --> 01:45:51,910
Well,
what rhonda has and what you want to 

2556
01:45:51,910 --> 01:45:51,910
has,
you know,

2557
01:45:51,910 --> 01:45:56,160
and not a whole lot of other women have 
it is one thing that they do where 

2558
01:45:56,160 --> 01:45:58,160
they're really fucking good at it and 
then they have all those other stuff.

2559
01:45:58,190 --> 01:46:03,190
Correct.
Whereas like paige vanzant is kind of 

2560
01:46:03,190 --> 01:46:03,190
learning the whole sport.
She's learning as she goes,

2561
01:46:03,190 --> 01:46:04,120
saying I should go,
but she,

2562
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:09,160
what she does,
what paige has is just toughness and 

2563
01:46:09,160 --> 01:46:09,160
she's hot.
That nestle,

2564
01:46:09,190 --> 01:46:13,670
that helps definitely helps.
but there's not other girls you know,

2565
01:46:13,671 --> 01:46:16,100
other than valentina.
Valentina shift chanko.

2566
01:46:16,130 --> 01:46:20,060
She's another one that's bad ass.
Who is another super powerful striker.

2567
01:46:20,130 --> 01:46:20,510
Yeah.
I mean,

2568
01:46:20,511 --> 01:46:22,550
the way she handled holly holm,
standing up.

2569
01:46:22,551 --> 01:46:23,600
I know man.
Yeah.

2570
01:46:23,601 --> 01:46:25,300
Handled her.
Just countered her.

2571
01:46:25,301 --> 01:46:27,290
It will.
That looping left hook,

2572
01:46:27,291 --> 01:46:29,180
that hook.
That throws off the right side.

2573
01:46:29,720 --> 01:46:31,010
Yeah.
She's another one,

2574
01:46:31,100 --> 01:46:34,100
but there's not you.
They need more of those,

2575
01:46:34,101 --> 01:46:34,770
you know.
I agree.

2576
01:46:35,060 --> 01:46:37,070
That's where mackenzie dern fits.
Exactly.

2577
01:46:37,200 --> 01:46:39,680
Can they come and do work and she's 
gorgeous.

2578
01:46:40,160 --> 01:46:41,960
But I'm saying if,
if conner's like,

2579
01:46:42,050 --> 01:46:44,030
listen,
I don't wish bad on anyone,

2580
01:46:44,150 --> 01:46:47,870
but if ron were to lose,
we thrown a party in Ireland becaUse I'm

2581
01:46:47,871 --> 01:46:51,480
the only show in town now.
Gimme my FuCking piece of the pie.

2582
01:46:51,780 --> 01:46:53,760
Well,
nobody has that sort of personality that

2583
01:46:53,761 --> 01:46:56,670
he has no one ever.
I think even he eclipses ali.

2584
01:46:56,700 --> 01:46:58,830
I've been clips is all of them.
I think he's.

2585
01:46:58,920 --> 01:47:03,690
He's bigger than shell sunnen for sure.
As far as like his ability to talk shit.

2586
01:47:03,710 --> 01:47:04,920
Not big,
but yeah,

2587
01:47:04,921 --> 01:47:07,950
I think he is.
I think he's better than ali baba.

2588
01:47:08,010 --> 01:47:09,770
Ali stood for different things.
Right.

2589
01:47:10,140 --> 01:47:14,280
His message is more important.
Fight for equal rights was also fighting

2590
01:47:14,281 --> 01:47:19,281
to stop the Vietnam war.
At times he had several things for him 

2591
01:47:19,281 --> 01:47:20,010
that were bigger.
Correct.

2592
01:47:20,770 --> 01:47:24,780
Is white privilege is nice suits,
nice suits.

2593
01:47:25,070 --> 01:47:28,050
If government is not trying to send them
over to fight in a war zone,

2594
01:47:28,060 --> 01:47:33,060
even a,
they're not stripping his belt for how 

2595
01:47:33,060 --> 01:47:33,060
long?
Three years.

2596
01:47:33,060 --> 01:47:34,500
Three prime.
It's just like basically taking the belt

2597
01:47:34,501 --> 01:47:36,240
from conrad in three years.
We'll see you soon.

2598
01:47:36,420 --> 01:47:38,730
And then it comes back to three years 
after not having trained at all.

2599
01:47:39,540 --> 01:47:42,300
Ali didn't even work out for three years
because when all he wasn't fighting,

2600
01:47:42,301 --> 01:47:43,380
it was like,
why would I work out?

2601
01:47:43,590 --> 01:47:44,550
Well,
fucked up.

2602
01:47:44,551 --> 01:47:46,170
So.
And he was never the same as he.

2603
01:47:46,260 --> 01:47:47,170
No,
no.

2604
01:47:47,220 --> 01:47:48,660
He,
not only was he not the same.

2605
01:47:48,870 --> 01:47:51,240
He didn't have the footwork anymore.
I didn't have the endurance.

2606
01:47:51,241 --> 01:47:56,241
And moi really came back.
You look at his body when he came back 

2607
01:47:56,241 --> 01:47:56,241
and fought,
he fought.

2608
01:47:56,241 --> 01:47:56,720
jerry quarry has come back,
but yes,

2609
01:47:56,760 --> 01:47:59,100
smooth.
And that's what's scary.

2610
01:47:59,160 --> 01:48:04,160
Not scary,
but to me it's just to see what happens 

2611
01:48:04,160 --> 01:48:04,160
with jon jones because now they 
suspended for a year.

2612
01:48:04,160 --> 01:48:08,451
Right.
And he's been out even longer and then 

2613
01:48:08,451 --> 01:48:08,451
before that,
so they're stupid as title.

2614
01:48:08,451 --> 01:48:08,870
And then dana obviously,
you know,

2615
01:48:08,880 --> 01:48:12,180
he never sticks to what he says.
Sometimes he does,

2616
01:48:12,181 --> 01:48:15,210
but he goes,
I'll never be a main event again.

2617
01:48:15,420 --> 01:48:18,480
Like we can't book him at the main event
because we can't trust them anymore.

2618
01:48:18,700 --> 01:48:19,680
Wow.
I know.

2619
01:48:19,681 --> 01:48:20,940
Right.
So for john,

2620
01:48:21,090 --> 01:48:26,090
granted he's doing that,
that flow grappling event against the 

2621
01:48:26,090 --> 01:48:26,490
fuck out of here.
That flow grappling.

2622
01:48:26,490 --> 01:48:28,470
He could have been fighting for the ufc 
heavyweight title.

2623
01:48:28,620 --> 01:48:29,630
Oh no,
I'm just saying let's see.

2624
01:48:29,640 --> 01:48:32,160
Joint something active.
Like at least he's not muhammad ali.

2625
01:48:32,370 --> 01:48:33,990
Yeah,
I guess he's lost millions of dollars,

2626
01:48:33,991 --> 01:48:37,450
but at least he's doing something in 
combat sports.

2627
01:48:37,480 --> 01:48:39,810
Well he's only suspended for a year 
retroactively.

2628
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:40,710
July.
Second.

2629
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:41,730
July.
Yeah.

2630
01:48:41,731 --> 01:48:46,360
So he has to get a while before that.
He did that huge laugh for you.

2631
01:48:46,440 --> 01:48:51,440
$200.
So when he comes back it's one inch to 

2632
01:48:51,440 --> 01:48:51,440
see what we get out of.
I know.

2633
01:48:51,440 --> 01:48:53,820
And then he came back and he fought over
in st prue and you know,

2634
01:48:53,821 --> 01:48:54,660
look,
kind of tentative.

2635
01:48:54,661 --> 01:48:58,350
And then you saw jimmy madame while run 
through over in st prue.

2636
01:48:58,740 --> 01:49:00,690
All these guys are getting better.
They're getting better.

2637
01:49:00,900 --> 01:49:03,360
They're rising up and you know,
rumble rumbles,

2638
01:49:03,540 --> 01:49:08,540
fight dc for the title again.
That's gonna be a real interesting 

2639
01:49:08,540 --> 01:49:08,540
fight.
Super interesting.

2640
01:49:08,540 --> 01:49:09,890
Remember,
rumbled did land that huge.

2641
01:49:10,140 --> 01:49:11,900
Dc and platinum.
Yeah.

2642
01:49:11,910 --> 01:49:13,080
who knows?
In this fight.

2643
01:49:13,081 --> 01:49:15,840
He's got neon lance in his corner now.
He's had them for a few years now.

2644
01:49:16,260 --> 01:49:19,850
He's worked with a lot on his grappling.
he guarantees concentrated a lot more.

2645
01:49:19,890 --> 01:49:24,890
His wrestling.
There's a lot of videos of him running 

2646
01:49:24,890 --> 01:49:24,890
wrestling drills,
wrestling nonstop.

2647
01:49:24,890 --> 01:49:28,390
So he's preparing,
preparing to get up is preparing for 

2648
01:49:28,390 --> 01:49:28,390
takedown defense fund fight,
man.

2649
01:49:28,390 --> 01:49:29,430
It's a toss up for me.
A toss up.

2650
01:49:29,850 --> 01:49:34,850
And then jon jones has all this laugh.
Comes back and you'd say rumble for a 

2651
01:49:34,850 --> 01:49:34,850
reason.
Wins.

2652
01:49:34,850 --> 01:49:35,370
He's like,
what's up man?

2653
01:49:35,430 --> 01:49:36,150
Yeah,
let's do it.

2654
01:49:36,210 --> 01:49:41,210
Well,
why do you think he's going to get a 

2655
01:49:41,210 --> 01:49:42,501
straight shot at the title?
I don't even know if we would get a 

2656
01:49:42,501 --> 01:49:42,501
straight shot at the title.
And upon coming back,

2657
01:49:42,501 --> 01:49:44,010
you don't know.
Everyone wants to see in it.

2658
01:49:44,030 --> 01:49:47,470
Maybe that's why the fans demand,
it might be something going on by by the

2659
01:49:47,471 --> 01:49:50,680
time this time rolls around next year or
july rolls around,

2660
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:52,840
so he's gonna.
He's free in july.

2661
01:49:52,841 --> 01:49:53,890
Whether that means.
See,

2662
01:49:53,891 --> 01:49:58,891
I don't know how suspensions work,
but what I would have been explained to 

2663
01:49:58,891 --> 01:50:02,671
me is performance enhancing drugs.
Suspensions don't even allow you to 

2664
01:50:02,671 --> 01:50:03,850
train with other fighters are on the 
roster.

2665
01:50:04,390 --> 01:50:05,500
Really?
Yes.

2666
01:50:05,530 --> 01:50:07,900
When your suspension is up,
then you can train with them.

2667
01:50:08,230 --> 01:50:10,420
I don't think you're even supposed to be
sparring with them.

2668
01:50:11,110 --> 01:50:14,200
once they hand down a suspension.
That regulation do know about.

2669
01:50:14,201 --> 01:50:15,150
That man is done.
Right.

2670
01:50:15,160 --> 01:50:16,690
I looked that up,
jamie.

2671
01:50:16,720 --> 01:50:18,490
I don't think that's true.
Wrap tHis up soon.

2672
01:50:18,550 --> 01:50:19,690
Yeah,
I don't think that's true.

2673
01:50:20,200 --> 01:50:23,410
I hope it's not because it's crazy 
because you could help your teammates.

2674
01:50:23,411 --> 01:50:25,810
Even if you're suspended,
you could still train and help your team

2675
01:50:25,811 --> 01:50:27,610
and also sharpen your sword a little 
bit.

2676
01:50:27,700 --> 01:50:29,140
It's like telling a guy who was an 
accountant.

2677
01:50:29,141 --> 01:50:34,141
You're suspended for a year.
You can't even touch a calculator when 

2678
01:50:34,141 --> 01:50:34,720
he's touching calculators.
Yeah,

2679
01:50:35,620 --> 01:50:40,620
go.
Does that t three Texas Instruments?

2680
01:50:41,720 --> 01:50:42,500
Uh,
no.

2681
01:50:42,550 --> 01:50:44,030
They used to make them have them in 
school.

2682
01:50:44,180 --> 01:50:49,180
Remember those.
Now it's now your phone's spike in 

2683
01:50:49,690 --> 01:50:52,570
three.
It was like a fucking game boy.

2684
01:50:52,600 --> 01:50:54,310
Yeah,
like the calculator business man.

2685
01:50:54,311 --> 01:50:59,311
They took a hit.
There are no longer around who's buying 

2686
01:50:59,311 --> 01:51:00,340
calculus?
They're like blockbuster.

2687
01:51:00,370 --> 01:51:03,520
There's none of theM left.
Men's over the same thing.

2688
01:51:03,521 --> 01:51:04,420
Jamie,
say anything.

2689
01:51:05,060 --> 01:51:07,540
The first article I clicked on was the 
one from last year.

2690
01:51:07,541 --> 01:51:09,640
So I don't think so.
But the other thing,

2691
01:51:09,641 --> 01:51:11,020
to your point where you don't think 
he'll.

2692
01:51:11,200 --> 01:51:13,630
Who says they'll get a title shot?
The lightweight,

2693
01:51:13,760 --> 01:51:18,760
uh,
the light heavyweight division is just 

2694
01:51:18,760 --> 01:51:21,040
ell dinosaurs besides the top few guys 
there are so old.

2695
01:51:21,280 --> 01:51:24,340
John's lIke,
I'm not fucking fighting shogun again.

2696
01:51:24,640 --> 01:51:28,450
I don't know how dare you fight again.
But jimmy man was a very dangerous fight

2697
01:51:28,451 --> 01:51:33,451
for anybody right now.
He's a dangerous fight for john to the 

2698
01:51:33,451 --> 01:51:36,770
region.
So I'm not matter what lit up over in st

2699
01:51:36,860 --> 01:51:40,240
prue you see what happened when he 
fought gusman he got cracked.

2700
01:51:40,300 --> 01:51:45,300
Yeah.
Do you see what happened when you got 

2701
01:51:45,300 --> 01:51:45,300
rumble?
He got crack.

2702
01:51:45,300 --> 01:51:45,880
He got dealt with upper echelon.
He dealt with,

2703
01:51:45,900 --> 01:51:47,650
right.
It's part of the game well over in st.

2704
01:51:47,740 --> 01:51:52,740
[inaudible] just went fucking the full 
distance with jon jones and a tough 

2705
01:51:52,740 --> 01:51:54,250
fight with sleepy John Jones and had a 
broken arm.

2706
01:51:54,700 --> 01:51:56,050
Yeah,
got his arm broken up.

2707
01:51:56,051 --> 01:51:58,120
John broke that arm kicks,
right?

2708
01:51:58,240 --> 01:52:00,640
Yeah,
but my point is he went the distance and

2709
01:52:00,670 --> 01:52:03,210
st louis took them out pretty quick.
I think he's,

2710
01:52:03,640 --> 01:52:06,850
I think not st prue rather jiMmy man and
we took them out pretty quick.

2711
01:52:07,030 --> 01:52:09,580
I think mountain was super dangerous,
very dangerous,

2712
01:52:09,850 --> 01:52:14,850
very dangerous.
First round for john has come back 

2713
01:52:14,850 --> 01:52:17,791
fight.
I think taking him down and beating him 

2714
01:52:17,791 --> 01:52:20,431
up on the ground.
Be john's best 100 percent and he's a 

2715
01:52:20,431 --> 01:52:22,630
trip.
I'm thrown to the ground and some of 

2716
01:52:22,630 --> 01:52:24,011
them also.
John's different than anybody else in 

2717
01:52:24,011 --> 01:52:24,490
his length and his ability to use it 
doesn't get hit really.

2718
01:52:24,640 --> 01:52:27,280
And his wrestling so fucking good.
Yeah.

2719
01:52:27,300 --> 01:52:31,240
He's just so scared.
Not scared to go to the ground anybody,

2720
01:52:31,270 --> 01:52:36,270
but you look at light.
The light heavyweight division is 

2721
01:52:36,270 --> 01:52:39,241
hurting the most out of anyone.
I think you could go down the roster 

2722
01:52:39,241 --> 01:52:39,241
like god,
dog,

2723
01:52:39,241 --> 01:52:40,060
we need some new blood in this bitch.
Yeah,

2724
01:52:40,061 --> 01:52:44,170
you might be right,
but the the main event in Brazil is ryan

2725
01:52:44,171 --> 01:52:45,980
bader reverse little dog little

2726
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:47,320
mugs.
Like I'll fucking do it all.

2727
01:52:47,330 --> 01:52:50,360
Do.
I've been fighting for 35 years when his

2728
01:52:50,361 --> 01:52:52,190
little night move like a goddamn 
tortoise,

2729
01:52:52,220 --> 01:52:53,840
but if you want to pay me,
I'll still do it.

2730
01:52:54,380 --> 01:52:57,620
He hasn't taken a same amount of 
punishment that his brother has,

2731
01:52:57,621 --> 01:52:59,800
but he's taken some big law knockouts.
Yeah.

2732
01:52:59,810 --> 01:53:00,260
Hope,
hope,

2733
01:53:00,440 --> 01:53:02,400
hope everyone's so.
Could you knock them out with a risk?

2734
01:53:02,870 --> 01:53:04,540
My god,
you're like clothesline,

2735
01:53:04,580 --> 01:53:09,580
don't know.
And Then the rumble one was just 

2736
01:53:09,580 --> 01:53:11,090
horrendous to suit.
I told you I was in the back of the luck

2737
01:53:11,110 --> 01:53:14,510
of a warming up pat cummings.
I'm a motherfucker warmed up,

2738
01:53:14,570 --> 01:53:17,370
but basically doing like arm stretches 
couldn't hit mitts.

2739
01:53:17,371 --> 01:53:18,740
You so stiff.
I was like,

2740
01:53:18,750 --> 01:53:19,930
who's he fighting?
Like,

2741
01:53:20,120 --> 01:53:20,970
like,
ah,

2742
01:53:21,110 --> 01:53:23,600
he can't go out there.
I looked at his coach.

2743
01:53:23,601 --> 01:53:24,250
I'm like,
no,

2744
01:53:24,710 --> 01:53:25,970
no,
I can't speak spanish,

2745
01:53:25,971 --> 01:53:28,640
but no bueno or portuguese.

2746
01:53:28,640 --> 01:53:29,090
Sorry.
Yeah,

2747
01:53:29,091 --> 01:53:29,390
the,
the.

2748
01:53:29,410 --> 01:53:30,550
There was no committee.
I'm like,

2749
01:53:30,560 --> 01:53:31,460
you can't go out there,
man.

2750
01:53:31,970 --> 01:53:35,690
I want to grab his leg like a three year
old nutland and walk out of the octagon.

2751
01:53:35,780 --> 01:53:39,410
I think Brazil is such a huge hotbed for
mma right now.

2752
01:53:39,530 --> 01:53:43,670
It's so gigantic that they need 
brazilian stars and you know,

2753
01:53:43,671 --> 01:53:45,590
for the main event in particular,
they're like,

2754
01:53:45,591 --> 01:53:48,230
just don't have a whole lot of options 
in the light heavyweight division,

2755
01:53:48,260 --> 01:53:53,260
so someone fucking wake up little nug 
out of a slumber because he's 

2756
01:53:53,260 --> 01:53:55,950
recuperating little log or big dog 
little dog because they're.

2757
01:53:55,951 --> 01:53:58,770
They're waking up as slumber because 
little big nugs done right.

2758
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:00,830
He's a little nod.
They woke his ass up and he's like,

2759
01:54:00,831 --> 01:54:01,690
yeah,
I'll fly beta.

2760
01:54:02,630 --> 01:54:05,630
he's probably asking for another fight,
but outside of him,

2761
01:54:05,900 --> 01:54:10,900
what other good light heavyweights from 
Brazil that are in the ufc that you 

2762
01:54:10,900 --> 01:54:13,010
could sell them in a vintner gloria,
but they already fought.

2763
01:54:13,130 --> 01:54:18,130
Right.
But glover just got cracked and he 

2764
01:54:18,130 --> 01:54:18,620
should probably take quite awhile off 
after that knockout.

2765
01:54:18,860 --> 01:54:21,260
That was a kind of knock out that you 
need to like not do nothing.

2766
01:54:21,680 --> 01:54:22,910
Lay low.
Yeah.

2767
01:54:22,911 --> 01:54:24,260
He got flat lined.
I mean,

2768
01:54:24,261 --> 01:54:26,180
so you got that light habit,
you got shogun,

2769
01:54:26,181 --> 01:54:27,510
which I don't know what's going on with 
sjogren's.

2770
01:54:27,511 --> 01:54:29,120
Got to be done.
If he's not done,

2771
01:54:29,121 --> 01:54:30,650
he's probably real close to being.
That's what I'm saying.

2772
01:54:30,651 --> 01:54:33,920
Like at light heavyweight bro.
Go through in Brazil though.

2773
01:54:34,010 --> 01:54:38,000
Even more so like as far as like 
brazilian fighters as far as fame.

2774
01:54:38,030 --> 01:54:43,030
Meticulous machida got suspended and 
suspended for a long fucking time,

2775
01:54:43,070 --> 01:54:44,420
isn't he?
Doesn't he have a two year?

2776
01:54:44,840 --> 01:54:46,370
I'm not sure.
It's not good.

2777
01:54:46,371 --> 01:54:50,150
I don't know if they've decided or not,
but I felt like he got suspended for two

2778
01:54:50,151 --> 01:54:55,151
years.
I mean just look at the brazilian 

2779
01:54:55,151 --> 01:54:55,151
fighters that especially.

2780
01:54:55,151 --> 01:54:57,910
You're right.
Light heavyweight machida was going 85 

2781
01:54:57,910 --> 01:54:57,910
anyway.
he can float between two and five.

2782
01:54:57,910 --> 01:55:01,850
I'm just thinking to five guys he could 
line up with in Brazil and not a lot.

2783
01:55:02,210 --> 01:55:07,210
Not a whole lot.
I mean beta already fought liotta you 

2784
01:55:07,210 --> 01:55:09,641
could sell that as a rematch because 
remember the little knocked him out in 

2785
01:55:09,641 --> 01:55:09,641
la.
A pad.

2786
01:55:09,641 --> 01:55:11,110
yeah,
but he suspended all the.

2787
01:55:11,120 --> 01:55:11,900
You're right though.
All the.

2788
01:55:11,960 --> 01:55:14,630
Especially there's not a lot of new 
blood in Brazil.

2789
01:55:15,040 --> 01:55:16,820
We get josie,
they'll get the faces.

2790
01:55:16,880 --> 01:55:19,670
Anderson silva is like fell off.
He just lost the business.

2791
01:55:19,910 --> 01:55:21,110
And then you got.
Oh,

2792
01:55:21,111 --> 01:55:23,280
then he lost a dc.
So he's basically done.

2793
01:55:23,300 --> 01:55:24,200
Well.
Thomas on made.

2794
01:55:24,201 --> 01:55:26,630
I was looking really good before cody 
garbrandt came around,

2795
01:55:26,780 --> 01:55:28,280
who he worked on,
he marked them.

2796
01:55:28,310 --> 01:55:29,300
Oh,
who's homeboy that?

2797
01:55:29,540 --> 01:55:33,240
Tj dillashaw is fighting kits.
Like a fucking match on linux.

2798
01:55:33,770 --> 01:55:34,320
Linux.

2799
01:55:34,400 --> 01:55:35,720
That's a good fight.
That's a good fight.

2800
01:55:35,721 --> 01:55:36,320
Very good.
Fight.

2801
01:55:36,321 --> 01:55:38,750
Linacre.
Or they told tj like,

2802
01:55:38,810 --> 01:55:40,730
listen,
we did think you'd be done with cruz.

2803
01:55:40,880 --> 01:55:42,470
You're not getting a title shot.
We're going to garment.

2804
01:55:42,710 --> 01:55:47,550
here's linacre though.
And if brent winds and tj winds,

2805
01:55:47,730 --> 01:55:49,230
it's a big f on both sides.
Right?

2806
01:55:49,270 --> 01:55:50,370
Who knows?
So big,

2807
01:55:50,371 --> 01:55:53,160
big if especially on the dominick cruz 
side,

2808
01:55:53,190 --> 01:55:54,930
good luck hitting that guy.
I know.

2809
01:55:54,931 --> 01:55:56,910
But if he does land,
he lands the geox.

2810
01:55:56,911 --> 01:55:58,410
Everybody.

2812
01:56:00,660 --> 01:56:03,630

2815
01:56:08,160 --> 01:56:11,940
He's just a small outage.

2816
01:56:12,030 --> 01:56:14,040
