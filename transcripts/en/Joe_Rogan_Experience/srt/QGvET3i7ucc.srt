1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,240
Five four,
three,

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:06,010
two,
one.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,480
Fuck it.
We'll do it live.

4
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:08,800
Fuck it.
We'll do it.

5
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:10,623
We'll do it live.

6
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,790
Josh [inaudible].
Today's a sad day in las bill o'reilly.

7
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:16,110
Oh,
am morning at you.

8
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,270
Morning Joe.
I feel like I should be,

9
00:00:18,271 --> 00:00:21,780
but I'm not a ton of loot.
What's that?

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,370
I said he made a ton of lewd.
Wow.

11
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,180
I mean since 96 when Fox News launched
and he was like the big,

12
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:29,280
I'm just making it up,
but that's when Fox News launch.

13
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:32,490
Let's check at Jamie,
is that when Fox News launched 96

14
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:36,370
[inaudible]

15
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:41,430
uh,
he has pulled in so much money for that

16
00:00:41,431 --> 00:00:44,280
network and for himself.
He was one of the bunch of bulls.

17
00:00:44,281 --> 00:00:46,980
The main guy,
he really was the main guy in

18
00:00:46,981 --> 00:00:49,680
broadcasting.
They're going to find another old cut to

19
00:00:49,681 --> 00:00:51,360
fill a spot.
You're going to have to,

20
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,990
that's what people look at.
That October 7th,

21
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:55,830
1996,
ladies and gentlemen,

22
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,830
you'll welcome America.
You'll wear that.

23
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,170
He was on like a hard copy or something
like that.

24
00:01:01,171 --> 00:01:02,340
Right.
I don't even know.

25
00:01:02,341 --> 00:01:04,710
I was too young.
I wasn't even here in the states.

26
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,090
Oh yeah,
I was at school,

27
00:01:06,091 --> 00:01:09,450
child in Australia and was a child.
I don't remember him from anything else.

28
00:01:09,451 --> 00:01:12,930
I just remember him being on o'reilly
and watching it and going,

29
00:01:12,931 --> 00:01:16,110
what is it?
It's like that longing for in the Stall

30
00:01:16,111 --> 00:01:16,921
Gia thing,
you know,

31
00:01:16,921 --> 00:01:20,130
you see an older gentleman in a tie who
just sit well and that's the way it is.

32
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:22,080
The tide goes in,
the tide goes out,

33
00:01:22,081 --> 00:01:25,290
can you define it?
What in the fuck is this guy doing?

34
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:28,140
And that was when he was talking,
he was talking to an atheist,

35
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:28,981
wasn't it?
Who was he?

36
00:01:28,981 --> 00:01:29,551
Was it?
Oh,

37
00:01:29,551 --> 00:01:32,450
I don't remember.
It was like maybe it was ricky Gervais'

38
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,420
or some,
I can't remember,

39
00:01:33,421 --> 00:01:36,750
but he was saying,
well maybe it was sam.

40
00:01:36,751 --> 00:01:40,710
Could it have been Sam Harris?
I don't know who it was somewhat.

41
00:01:40,711 --> 00:01:42,990
Some atheist was saying like a w was
saying,

42
00:01:42,991 --> 00:01:43,824
what do you,
he was like,

43
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:48,630
Bill was like,
I've got the absolute number one reason

44
00:01:48,631 --> 00:01:52,890
why you have to believe in God because
tide goes in.

45
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,720
Tide goes out,
always been that way.

46
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,450
Always will be that way when one goes
round or just spins around.

47
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,950
How do you explain that?
If not God,

48
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,580
it was just super obvious that he was
pandering because the guy went to

49
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:03,420
fucking Harvard.

50
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,950
Okay.
Bill O'reilly's not a dope.

51
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,290
He might be a Douche bag,
but he's not a dope.

52
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,260
He's not.
I think religion makes people dopey and

53
00:02:10,261 --> 00:02:12,540
ways that they don't and they don't even
know about,

54
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:15,540
I don't even think he's religious.
I think he's barely religious.

55
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:18,030
I think he's religious enough to get by
with the job.

56
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,330
I said,
do you think he's in since he has been

57
00:02:21,331 --> 00:02:24,090
in some see 100% because I think he's
one of the,

58
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:25,740
look,
I don't watch the show a lot,

59
00:02:25,741 --> 00:02:26,620
so I'm not sure.
But I,

60
00:02:26,621 --> 00:02:28,920
he's always struck me as one of the more
straight shooters.

61
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:33,120
I think he is.
He's smart but not wise.

62
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,350
Yes.
Uh,

63
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:36,600
you know,
he feels what he feels in his gut is

64
00:02:36,601 --> 00:02:38,610
more important than what the data tells
him.

65
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,910
And I think he falls for a bunch of
fallacies that a lot of people fall for,

66
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:45,480
especially if they're religious.
Like the idea that there was a certain

67
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:48,840
order to the cosmos and how could we all
have come about?

68
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:52,250
How could this whole thing around us
exist with all these butterflies and the

69
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,320
moon and the tide comes in and the tide
goes out and does his,

70
00:02:55,321 --> 00:02:57,180
me and Joe,
these spiritual creatures,

71
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,230
these beings sitting opposite each other
on a,

72
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,220
at a table

73
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:03,880
in Los Angeles right now.
Some people just find that to

74
00:03:03,881 --> 00:03:07,210
inexplicably to explain without a deity,
so they're like,

75
00:03:07,211 --> 00:03:08,920
all right,
there must've been a big guy who did it.

76
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:13,520
It's even dumber in my opinion,
to think that one dude engineered this

77
00:03:13,521 --> 00:03:14,810
whole fucking thing.
I mean,

78
00:03:14,811 --> 00:03:16,480
wouldn't,
wouldn't you just think that,

79
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:19,310
oh wow.
There's some crazy super complex system

80
00:03:19,311 --> 00:03:24,311
that sort of works in some odd way where
it balances itself out with Predator and

81
00:03:24,681 --> 00:03:29,450
prey and food and water and fire and
dirt and all this stuff together,

82
00:03:29,451 --> 00:03:32,310
and then you realize that it all has to
form out of the the,

83
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:35,480
the,
the actual elements that come from an

84
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:38,180
exploding star.
It's magnificent.

85
00:03:38,181 --> 00:03:39,510
Just the actual,
this,

86
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:44,750
the full realm of things that they've
absolutely proven to be true in terms of

87
00:03:44,751 --> 00:03:47,350
like scientific discoveries about the
universe and the,

88
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:51,620
yeah,
just the very elements that constitute

89
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:54,830
human beings and everything.
You see this table and laptops,

90
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:59,440
it's amazing the idea that one dude and
sitting there up in his class

91
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,770
and of course moderate religious people
will say,

92
00:04:02,771 --> 00:04:04,600
well,
of course we don't believe in that kind

93
00:04:04,601 --> 00:04:06,910
of a god.
We don't believe in a God with a robe

94
00:04:06,911 --> 00:04:10,870
and a beard sitting in the clouds.
We believe in a more sophisticated

95
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,000
metaphorical version of God.
Yeah,

96
00:04:13,001 --> 00:04:18,001
but you still believe that whatever
consciousness created black holes and

97
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:24,460
the whole cosmos gives a shit whether or
not you beat off well also that it has

98
00:04:24,461 --> 00:04:26,410
to be a one.
Yeah.

99
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,630
Hey God,
a thin one thing,

100
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:31,270
unless you're a Hindu,
in which case I've got an elephant got

101
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,130
over here,
I've got to emission whoever.

102
00:04:33,131 --> 00:04:38,131
Here I've got a multi armed monkey
and you got a lot of Hash Hash to say

103
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,060
those things.
I mean,

104
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:46,510
one of the things that's interesting is
I think at any given point in time,

105
00:04:46,511 --> 00:04:51,340
people just assumed that the universe
was created by whatever thing happens to

106
00:04:51,341 --> 00:04:55,600
be around them.
It was on the podcast head that that was

107
00:04:55,601 --> 00:04:57,850
a great upset.
I had him on my podcast with,

108
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,631
uh,
no,

109
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:01,360
I had him on point of inquiry actually,
which is a different podcast than my

110
00:05:01,361 --> 00:05:04,120
normal one where the people,
like the week before he was on yours,

111
00:05:04,121 --> 00:05:06,100
yours was way better.
You can talk about a lot of shit in

112
00:05:06,101 --> 00:05:06,821
three hours.
Joe,

113
00:05:06,821 --> 00:05:08,830
you kind of took that theme and that's
why I like doing it.

114
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:09,770
Yeah.
Broke

115
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:14,240
my brain with this one thing he said.
He explained that when you talk about

116
00:05:14,241 --> 00:05:18,260
the universe being 14 billion years old,
you're talking about the observable

117
00:05:18,261 --> 00:05:23,261
universe and he's like,
the problem is space moves faster than

118
00:05:23,571 --> 00:05:25,880
light.
The universe is moving faster than the

119
00:05:25,881 --> 00:05:30,860
speed of light.
So what we're seeing is what we can see

120
00:05:30,861 --> 00:05:33,800
from 14 billion years ago because,
but that doesn't mean that's all there

121
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:34,580
is,
right.

122
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:37,460
He goes,
space itself is bending.

123
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:40,940
But what he's saying is space itself
beyond that could be infinite.

124
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,740
It's just moving faster than we can see.
He just spread my brain.

125
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,581
Yeah,
exactly.

126
00:05:46,581 --> 00:05:47,271
So,
but he was saying,

127
00:05:47,271 --> 00:05:49,550
it's like when you're talking about the
observable universe being,

128
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:53,720
I think it's 13.7 billion years,
almost 14 billion years old.

129
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,080
That's just how far back we can see.
He's like,

130
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:00,050
but before that,
like when you go back further.

131
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:02,960
Yeah,
that's right.

132
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:08,000
It's just that we can't see it because
the space itself is moving faster than

133
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:09,350
the speed of light.
That's right.

134
00:06:09,351 --> 00:06:11,330
And you're also,
what you're looking at is not only the

135
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,970
edge of the universe,
but the edge of time.

136
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,740
Yeah.
Because it's not even the edge.

137
00:06:15,741 --> 00:06:20,240
What he's saying is it's,
it's very likely that not only is it

138
00:06:20,241 --> 00:06:22,130
infinite,
but there's an infinite number of

139
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:24,410
possibilities beyond it.
Yes.

140
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:27,920
And those things beyond it may also be
right alongside us.

141
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,870
I mean,
in terms of the other dimensions and

142
00:06:29,871 --> 00:06:31,920
things like that,
like he didn't even get into all of it,

143
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:34,580
all of that stuff.
But if you believe in string theory and

144
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:37,040
quantum physics and if you believe in
math,

145
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:41,390
then you sort of have to,
well quantum physics and string theory

146
00:06:41,391 --> 00:06:44,600
to a dope like me is one of those things
where I have to contact your word for

147
00:06:44,601 --> 00:06:44,660
it.

148
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:47,240
It's almost like before the,
uh,

149
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,320
before the Lutheran Times,
before the Bible was translated and you

150
00:06:51,321 --> 00:06:53,060
have to rely on the priest,
just trust the price.

151
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:57,440
I'll just you and your knowledge cause
he knows Latin and he speaks Aramaic.

152
00:06:57,441 --> 00:06:59,030
You know it's going to read this shit.
Yeah.

153
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,400
Who told the priest?
Well the pope who told the Pope don't

154
00:07:01,401 --> 00:07:03,680
ask questions,
but when you go into this food,

155
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:07,430
that's why it's so important to,
to appreciate like when people are

156
00:07:07,431 --> 00:07:10,850
science deniers,
it's so frustrating because everything

157
00:07:10,851 --> 00:07:13,460
you use,
everything you enjoy,

158
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:16,070
everything that you in terms of
medicine,

159
00:07:16,071 --> 00:07:21,071
technology is based on the work of
countless people who have worked

160
00:07:21,111 --> 00:07:24,530
generations after generations on the
innovations of the past.

161
00:07:24,531 --> 00:07:27,380
Like the people before them invented
some shit.

162
00:07:27,381 --> 00:07:29,690
They improved upon it.
They figured out more.

163
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,060
They studied the calculations of those
people,

164
00:07:32,061 --> 00:07:35,240
they added to it.
And then you get to 2017 so whenever

165
00:07:35,241 --> 00:07:39,920
someone steps in with an incredibly
limited understanding of science or of

166
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,840
what we're,
what we're dealing with in terms of the

167
00:07:41,841 --> 00:07:43,160
universe itself and says,
Whoa,

168
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,870
tide goes in,
the tide goes out.

169
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,150
You can't explain it like you mother
fucker.

170
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:49,130
They've been explaining the tides
forever.

171
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:52,780
What are you talking about you?
I think what he actually means is Yukon.

172
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:56,780
Explain why there is.
Why there is something instead of total

173
00:07:56,781 --> 00:08:01,060
chaos and anarchy.
I think you can get sold credit.

174
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:02,930
He's a douchebag.
He's,

175
00:08:02,931 --> 00:08:05,330
I think he's pandering.
I think he was just trying to,

176
00:08:05,331 --> 00:08:08,000
I think he knows there's a bunch of old
dummies out there,

177
00:08:08,001 --> 00:08:09,560
crocheting,
you know,

178
00:08:09,561 --> 00:08:12,260
with three teeth listening to his stupid
fucking shit.

179
00:08:12,261 --> 00:08:14,840
I don't think that you can be highly
intelligent and religious.

180
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:19,490
Yes you can,
but you highly effective at individual

181
00:08:19,491 --> 00:08:21,840
pursuits.
Now when you talk,

182
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,910
when you say highly intelligent,
as soon as soon as someone is religious

183
00:08:25,911 --> 00:08:28,910
in terms of like if you believe in
preposterous notions,

184
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,070
like there's a guy who came back to
life,

185
00:08:31,071 --> 00:08:33,320
he turns water into wine,
he walks on water.

186
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:36,020
If you believe that you're not
intelligent,

187
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,350
you're just not well,
I don't believe you're intelligent.

188
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:42,770
I think you are intelligent in
individual disciplines,

189
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,950
but obviously if you believe something
that makes no sense whatsoever,

190
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,790
you believe that someone was magic.
Someone defied physics.

191
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:53,540
Someone had superpowers.
Someone was a person who could bring

192
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:55,950
people back to life.
Someone could come back to life

193
00:08:55,951 --> 00:08:56,670
themselves.

194
00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:01,670
There's no evidence.
You believe this on the flimsiest

195
00:09:01,711 --> 00:09:05,250
fucking evidence that wasn't even
written down until 70 or 80 years after

196
00:09:05,251 --> 00:09:10,251
that dude died because Christianity
didn't even so been worse than that

197
00:09:10,501 --> 00:09:14,860
because the old testament is far older
than totally notion of Jesus,

198
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,830
but that's not it.
Hang on,

199
00:09:16,831 --> 00:09:19,020
I,
I do quibble with the idea that this,

200
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:22,560
that you can't be smart.
Stephen Colbert was one of the smartest,

201
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:25,490
the word smart.
This is what the problem is like would

202
00:09:25,491 --> 00:09:27,060
define smart,
what you believe.

203
00:09:27,061 --> 00:09:28,200
Stupid Shit.
Are you smart?

204
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:32,100
You are implying that the reason why
bill o'reilly talks about tide goes in

205
00:09:32,101 --> 00:09:35,400
tide goes out is because he's pandering
to people because he's,

206
00:09:35,401 --> 00:09:38,220
he's a Harvard guy and there's no way
that he would be dumb enough to believe

207
00:09:38,221 --> 00:09:38,970
that no,
I'm,

208
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:41,280
I'm,
I'm complying that because I looked at

209
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:44,610
the way he said it and I know what he
does and I think he's manipulative and I

210
00:09:44,611 --> 00:09:47,100
think what he's doing is playing to his
base.

211
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,180
I think there's a lot of people out
there that want to see some smug liberal

212
00:09:51,181 --> 00:09:54,900
atheist get taken down a notch and bill
just the guy to do it and talk over him

213
00:09:54,901 --> 00:09:57,900
and he's a big giant guys.
You can yell and get all aggressive.

214
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,310
We went on,
I don't understand is like steven called

215
00:10:00,311 --> 00:10:03,420
Bay is obviously a very smart guy.
He's a Catholic.

216
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:05,310
Andrew Sullivan.
I know if you know him,

217
00:10:05,311 --> 00:10:08,640
the blogger a,
he's a friend of Sam Harris's like he's

218
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:12,540
a Christian and good luck.
These people find ways of

219
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:15,960
compartmentalizing logic I guess.
So like as you say,

220
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:18,150
they believe in something that is
totally crazy.

221
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:21,630
I mean the idea that you can say a
certain number of Latin words over a

222
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:25,350
over a cracker and it'll turn bodily
into the flesh of someone who existed

223
00:10:25,351 --> 00:10:28,440
2000 years ago.
It's crazy magic talk.

224
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,340
Well,
it's crazy talk,

225
00:10:29,341 --> 00:10:32,670
but there are people that are religious
that are extremely intelligent and I

226
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:33,660
agree with you on this.

227
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:37,680
Like Jordan Peterson,
who's a brilliant man who is very

228
00:10:37,681 --> 00:10:41,250
religious in the sense that he studies
religion and he believes there's some

229
00:10:41,251 --> 00:10:46,170
fundamental principles that are involved
in religion that are in extra bowl to

230
00:10:46,171 --> 00:10:49,320
the human condition.
And I think he think he thinks they're

231
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:53,820
important to our society and to civility
and ethics and morals.

232
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:56,640
I don't think he believes people walked
on water.

233
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,010
I don't think he believed someone came
back from the dead.

234
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:03,360
I don't think he believes this stupid
shit and I don't think the stupid shit

235
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:08,690
is even the original story.
The huge problem with religion is

236
00:11:08,821 --> 00:11:11,820
translation over time.
That's one of the biggest problems.

237
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,020
The oldest version of the Bible that we
know of is the Dead Sea Scrolls.

238
00:11:16,021 --> 00:11:19,860
They don't even use that because it's so
fucking crazy.

239
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:22,950
If you listen to some of the
translations of the Dead Sea Scrolls,

240
00:11:22,951 --> 00:11:25,380
are you read?
Some of it is unbelievably crazy.

241
00:11:25,381 --> 00:11:27,480
I mean it sounds like science fiction
stuff.

242
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:31,800
And if you go back to that version of
it,

243
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:34,410
I mean you're talking about stuff that
was written on animal skins.

244
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:35,550
They used to do they,
they,

245
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:39,960
they did DNA tests to make sure that the
pieces that they got,

246
00:11:39,961 --> 00:11:41,490
you don't,
you know the whole story behind the Dead

247
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:44,800
Sea scrolls basically,
but you found them in Cobra on the

248
00:11:44,801 --> 00:11:48,720
scrolls were written on animal skin.
So the,

249
00:11:48,721 --> 00:11:51,150
they were broken up.
So the piece them back together,

250
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,980
they had to do DNA testing to make sure
that the piece

251
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,430
of skin came from the same cow.
And then they had to try to figure out,

252
00:11:57,431 --> 00:11:58,990
okay,
where does all this shit go?

253
00:11:58,991 --> 00:12:00,940
And then how to,
how to put it into place.

254
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,920
But they don't even use that version of
the Bible.

255
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:05,260
And even if you use the Old Testament,
people say,

256
00:12:05,261 --> 00:12:07,300
well that's the Old Testament.
We don't really,

257
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:10,270
we go by the New Testament,
which is even more preposterous because

258
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:14,140
the new testament was written by
Constantine and a bunch of bishops and

259
00:12:14,141 --> 00:12:17,650
men decided what to leave in and what to
take out.

260
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:18,260
They decided

261
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,370
of course,
and that the whole chunks of it a

262
00:12:20,371 --> 00:12:24,050
contradictory as true as well as the
Bible,

263
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,590
but I mean we're just talking about the
bio for now.

264
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:29,400
Constantine wasn't even religious.
I mean Constantine wasn't even a

265
00:12:29,401 --> 00:12:32,800
Christian until he died.
He was converted on his fucking death

266
00:12:32,801 --> 00:12:34,830
bed.
I mean he just did it so that he could

267
00:12:34,831 --> 00:12:36,960
unite Rome.
He knew what the fuck he was doing.

268
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:38,610
He was getting all these people to
operate together.

269
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:40,650
Does this mean there's No God,
absolutely not.

270
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,660
Does this mean that I have in the
answers that you don't have?

271
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:46,650
Of course not.
I'm just saying people are full of Shit

272
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,940
and that story sucks.

273
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,380
It's that simple.
Why they may.

274
00:12:49,381 --> 00:12:51,480
I think what we do too much of is
confusing.

275
00:12:51,481 --> 00:12:53,400
Two questions,
one of which is,

276
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:57,780
is there a god without defining what God
is and the other of which is,

277
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:02,190
is there any reason to believe in a
particular faith or a particular

278
00:13:02,191 --> 00:13:05,850
denomination to be a Christian or a
Muslim or a Jew or whatever

279
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:09,290
done in further than that people don't
know.

280
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,710
And anyone who says they know that's not
telling the truth.

281
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,300
Yeah.
We're not talking about,

282
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,870
well,
we do know that carbon comes from stars

283
00:13:17,871 --> 00:13:18,410
when they explode.
Yeah.

284
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:21,140
Well that can be scientifically
explained and proven.

285
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:23,390
We're not talking about that.
We're talking about,

286
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:28,540
do you know whether or not Jesus was a
man who came back from the dead and turn

287
00:13:28,881 --> 00:13:31,000
water into what you do not know?
One

288
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,340
it is.
I know with as much certainty that he

289
00:13:34,341 --> 00:13:37,250
didn't do that.
I don't know anything about the past.

290
00:13:37,251 --> 00:13:38,930
But you don't hear.
You honestly don't.

291
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,093
You don't.
Well,

292
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,720
how do,
how do you know what Napoleon did?

293
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,840
You don't write well,
we know historical records.

294
00:13:44,841 --> 00:13:46,850
We know the stories of people from back
then,

295
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,680
but the idea that

296
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:53,520
this one guy did things that no human
being could ever do today.

297
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,620
Yeah.
Defied logic,

298
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,420
physics,
the laws of nature,

299
00:13:57,421 --> 00:14:00,570
the laws of life and death,
all the different reality.

300
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:05,190
The reality is that we accept today in
terms of what's provable,

301
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:09,510
what we know about biological life.
All that stuff was violated by this one

302
00:14:09,511 --> 00:14:10,344
guy.
Yup.

303
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,870
Could have happened.
They could have,

304
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:15,020
it could have in the same way.
I'm like close might not have happened.

305
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:18,380
No.
It's way less likely than that.

306
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,590
You reckon it's more likely that Jesus
was divine?

307
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,540
No.
The opposite.

308
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:27,830
It's way more likely to called the
Holocaust didn't happen then that Jesus

309
00:14:27,831 --> 00:14:30,590
did all of that shit and I think the
Holocaust is 100% real.

310
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:32,090
He sounds like me too.
I mean that's,

311
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,870
that's kind of my point.
There is a religious people put an undue

312
00:14:35,871 --> 00:14:39,050
burden on on nonreligious people by
saying,

313
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,630
look,
who's to say?

314
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,530
I say there's a God.
You say there's not a god,

315
00:14:42,531 --> 00:14:45,050
it's a 50 50 toss up.
I'm just going to believe in Christian.

316
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:47,360
I've heard call bear say this to Bill
Maher on his show.

317
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:49,100
Look,
I'm a Christian.

318
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:52,190
I've got nothing to lose.
If I turn out to be right

319
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:55,370
and Christianity is true,
whoop de do I get to go to heaven?

320
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,590
If I,
if it turns out that Christianity is

321
00:14:57,591 --> 00:14:59,780
wrong,
then I just die.

322
00:14:59,781 --> 00:15:01,640
But at least you know,
give it a chance.

323
00:15:01,641 --> 00:15:03,170
This is Pascal's wager,
right?

324
00:15:03,171 --> 00:15:06,800
This is this idea that you might as well
be religious because hey,

325
00:15:06,801 --> 00:15:09,530
if it's true,
you've got an attorney of goodness,

326
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,980
but here's the thing and you avoid hell
fire.

327
00:15:10,981 --> 00:15:11,130
Yeah.

328
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:16,130
Can't be true because no one knows like
no one has died and giving you the debt.

329
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:21,500
No one's died with a VCR or you know,
a vhs tape recorder and comeback with a

330
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,700
knock here,
put this in the machine and play it.

331
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:25,080
This is heaven.
I've shown you,

332
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,690
but it's not even a 50 50 shot is what
I'm saying.

333
00:15:27,691 --> 00:15:30,690
It's not like black.
Bertrand Russell kind of demolished this

334
00:15:30,691 --> 00:15:33,390
idea with his teapot analogy where he
said like,

335
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,910
okay,
I'm going to claim that there's a teapot

336
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:39,330
circling in orbit between the Earth and
the moon,

337
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:43,290
and now if you deny that,
then hey,

338
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:46,200
it's just a 50 50 shot.
Maybe it's there.

339
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,940
Maybe it's not there.
Who's to say,

340
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,560
obviously you would say,
no,

341
00:15:49,561 --> 00:15:51,810
I think it's not there because if
there's no evidence that it's there,

342
00:15:51,811 --> 00:15:53,640
I'm not going to just going to believe
you because you say it.

343
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:55,530
And similarly if you say,
oh,

344
00:15:55,531 --> 00:15:56,400
this guy,
Jesus,

345
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:58,800
2000 years ago,
he turned water into wine.

346
00:15:58,801 --> 00:16:02,160
He walked on water and then he was the
son of God and that God requires you to

347
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:04,350
believe on him.
Otherwise you're going to go to hell

348
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,360
forever and you say,
why should I believe that?

349
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,100
And they can't turn around and say,
hey,

350
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:10,500
it's a 50 50 shot.
It's not a 50 50 shot.

351
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:13,140
There are good reasons for believing
things and bad reasons for believing

352
00:16:13,141 --> 00:16:16,980
things and religion almost always only
offered bad reasons for believing in it.

353
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,820
Well,
as soon as you start talking numbers,

354
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,000
percentages and stuff,
like you're just making those numbers

355
00:16:22,001 --> 00:16:22,510
up,
right?

356
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:26,770
50 50 where are you coming up with that?
How about a 50 50 shot?

357
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,360
This is vegas odds.
Like what is this little group?

358
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,790
A lot of religious people.
It doesn't mean,

359
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,370
here's the thing.
If people are listening to your getting

360
00:16:33,371 --> 00:16:35,650
fucking pissed,
it doesn't mean there's not a higher

361
00:16:35,651 --> 00:16:37,450
power.
It doesn't mean it's not an order to

362
00:16:37,451 --> 00:16:42,130
this university signs that it's super
likely that if there is something that's

363
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:47,460
unbelievably powerful and there's some
law that keeps the universe together and

364
00:16:47,741 --> 00:16:51,430
some force of good that's trying to
guide us in this.

365
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:54,040
There's some,
you know there's some beautiful

366
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:58,990
inclinations towards that direction.
What I'm saying is I guarantee you that

367
00:16:58,991 --> 00:17:03,991
the people who lived 2000 years ago who
wrote this shit down on leather with you

368
00:17:05,571 --> 00:17:06,970
know,
ink that they met at a plant,

369
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,410
they didn't have all the data.

370
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,690
They just didn't know.
They just didn't,

371
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:14,530
they didn't know July theory of disease.
I mean they didn't even know that the

372
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:18,790
Earth's spinning around the sun.
He showed the people who understood the

373
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:21,830
most about the cosmos or some shit
today.

374
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,370
I mean the reason why they didn't want
any pork is because they figured out

375
00:17:24,371 --> 00:17:25,330
trick analysis.
They're like,

376
00:17:25,331 --> 00:17:27,190
oh listen,
if you need these fucking pigs,

377
00:17:27,191 --> 00:17:28,630
ma'am,
kimber getting sick left and really got

378
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,730
to stop doing that.
As for those things that crawl off on

379
00:17:30,731 --> 00:17:32,100
the bottom of the ocean.
Yeah.

380
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,610
Give me any of that shit.
Exactly.

381
00:17:33,611 --> 00:17:35,560
Well the got hooked up with red tide.
They're like,

382
00:17:35,561 --> 00:17:35,920
look,
yeah,

383
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,460
we're dying.
We've got to stop eating shell fish.

384
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:41,830
And there's a lot of like real logic to
the Wa the the reasons why they had laws

385
00:17:41,831 --> 00:17:44,560
and it makes,
makes sense.

386
00:17:44,561 --> 00:17:47,950
But the real issue again is the
translation.

387
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:50,040
It was that the ancient Hebrew

388
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,950
version of the Bible,
ancient Hebrew,

389
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:58,220
the words also double as numbers.
Like do you know that letters or numbers

390
00:17:58,381 --> 00:17:59,870
in ancient Hebrew,
right.

391
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,680
Their alphabet,
they don't have numbers.

392
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:05,820
So the letter a is also the number one.
So words have numerical value,

393
00:18:05,821 --> 00:18:09,420
like the word God and the word love,
they have the same numerical value.

394
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:12,870
All that was lost in translation when
you translated to Latin,

395
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:14,790
Greek,
eventually English,

396
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,180
all that Shit was lost.
Like it's the,

397
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:21,090
the ancient Hebrew version of it.
Like if you ever read like some really

398
00:18:21,091 --> 00:18:23,930
goofy translation of English,
Japanese.

399
00:18:23,931 --> 00:18:24,810
Yeah.
And you're like,

400
00:18:24,811 --> 00:18:28,260
what in the fuck are they saying?
Or if you translated English into a

401
00:18:28,261 --> 00:18:31,140
foreign language and then translate it
back from that foreign language into

402
00:18:31,141 --> 00:18:32,940
English,
if it comes jibberish.

403
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:35,700
Well,
one of the things I love about instagram

404
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,880
is it has a translation thing that I use
a lot of times that follow out of

405
00:18:38,881 --> 00:18:39,840
Russian fighters.

406
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:44,160
There's a lot of a Russian MMA fighters
and I follow their pages and I'll go,

407
00:18:44,161 --> 00:18:45,950
okay,
let's hit the translate and now hit

408
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,621
translate.
I'm like,

409
00:18:46,621 --> 00:18:49,260
Jesus,
it seems especially hard for some

410
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:50,120
reason.
It's got to lead.

411
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:52,680
We had pronouns and things are always
saying good.

412
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:55,920
This is the best fight.
The well,

413
00:18:55,921 --> 00:18:58,470
it's also like their language looks
different.

414
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:58,891
Yeah,
no,

415
00:18:58,891 --> 00:19:01,560
it's totally in cyrillic.
If you had the,

416
00:19:01,561 --> 00:19:04,530
uh,
the claim that the 72 virgins in the

417
00:19:04,531 --> 00:19:07,470
Koran or actually 72 raisins,
no,

418
00:19:07,471 --> 00:19:10,740
but you know what?
That wood is almost the same between

419
00:19:10,741 --> 00:19:12,390
reason and virgin.
No,

420
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:16,800
the expression 72 is like a fuck load.
That's what it means.

421
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,090
It doesn't mean 72 virgins,
but it means like there'll be 72 and

422
00:19:21,091 --> 00:19:21,751
you're like,
wow,

423
00:19:21,751 --> 00:19:22,980
that's,
that's enough.

424
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:23,910
That's enough.
We're good.

425
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:27,180
I would not need more than 72 virgins or
raisins.

426
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,860
It's to help me happy bringing them to
life.

427
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:32,850
It's probably not even the number 72
it's just like our translation from

428
00:19:32,851 --> 00:19:36,510
Arabic to English to screws it up and
then someone probably came up with this

429
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,280
numerical value a long time ago and they
stuck with 72 so I believe in science,

430
00:19:41,281 --> 00:19:43,170
paypal.
So talking about bill o'reilly,

431
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,040
do you think he should have been fired?
I don't know what he did and I know I

432
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:48,180
don't know what he didn't do.
You know?

433
00:19:48,181 --> 00:19:50,000
I don't know.
I know he's definitely done some gross

434
00:19:50,001 --> 00:19:53,580
shit in the past.
Like there's the audio of him calling

435
00:19:53,581 --> 00:19:57,430
that check and say he's going to take a
loofa sponge Loofah,

436
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,900
big,
big olive bill with his luther in the

437
00:20:00,901 --> 00:20:01,800
shower.
I don't know.

438
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:02,850
You know,
who knows?

439
00:20:02,851 --> 00:20:06,240
I would imagine whenever you hear a
story about a guy like that,

440
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:08,520
that's,
some of it is probably fabricated.

441
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,430
I know.
I just don't imagine that all the people

442
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:15,180
that say things about him or all telling
the 100% truth,

443
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:16,050
I wouldn't matter.

444
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:18,760
Imagine that would be true because
people are just not like,

445
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,440
once it gets beyond a few paypal,
then you think that the preponderance of

446
00:20:22,441 --> 00:20:24,330
evidence is that they're probably,
yeah,

447
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,890
I guess you can't say they're all
telling the truth,

448
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,020
but it's hard to take their word for it.
No,

449
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,250
you don't.
You definitely don't.

450
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:30,600
If they're a six,
seven,

451
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,300
eight people,
definitely stories.

452
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,500
You definitely have to go.
Hmm.

453
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,710
But you don't have to take all their
word for it because first of all,

454
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,870
you don't know those people.
You'd have to know those people.

455
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:42,960
You'd have to really know if they were
honest.

456
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:47,980
You'd have to really be there.
You got to to know what really is so

457
00:20:47,981 --> 00:20:50,260
fucking hard man.
Because first of all,

458
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,240
people,
not only are they full of shit,

459
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:55,120
but their memory sucks.
People's memories.

460
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:57,130
Like if you,
I'm sure you've had a conversation with

461
00:20:57,131 --> 00:21:00,250
someone about something that happened
that you witnessed as well and you both

462
00:21:00,251 --> 00:21:02,760
have totally different memories of
memories that terrible.

463
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,580
But I've come to accept that though for
myself over the last few years,

464
00:21:06,581 --> 00:21:09,940
like I used to like clean the memories
and then try to argue them.

465
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:15,150
But I think it's been scientifically
proven that the human memory is one of

466
00:21:16,091 --> 00:21:18,940
the worst pieces of evidence that you
could ever call upon.

467
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:20,590
Yeah.
The justice system is dining to de

468
00:21:20,591 --> 00:21:23,770
prioritize it as well as it should do.
Because in the past,

469
00:21:23,771 --> 00:21:25,830
like I witnessed,
you know,

470
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:29,340
accounts in courtrooms have been very
highly prioritized.

471
00:21:29,341 --> 00:21:32,110
Like they'd been very highly valued and
prized by prosecutors.

472
00:21:32,111 --> 00:21:32,501
Wow.
Well,

473
00:21:32,501 --> 00:21:34,720
I mean this person points out the WHO
and the,

474
00:21:34,721 --> 00:21:36,610
you know,
do you see that person sitting in the

475
00:21:36,611 --> 00:21:37,790
courtroom today,
madam?

476
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:39,790
And she points their finger and well,
it's a slam dunk.

477
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:42,900
Of course that was the perpetrator.
Now we realize people are memories all

478
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:47,140
the terrible and wrong all the time.
We're really susceptible to suggestion

479
00:21:47,141 --> 00:21:48,790
and influence and all that sort of
stuff.

480
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:53,260
But I think you kind of remember whether
or not your boss who's a television star

481
00:21:53,261 --> 00:21:55,210
put his hand up your skirt.
Very likely,

482
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:59,440
probably.
But there's also someone who could be

483
00:21:59,441 --> 00:22:04,441
seriously deceptive and very ambitious
and realizes that bill o'reilly's kind

484
00:22:04,511 --> 00:22:06,340
of a Twat and this is what I'm going to
do.

485
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:09,730
I'm going to get close to this old cut
and I'm going to get this guy to get

486
00:22:09,731 --> 00:22:12,130
creepy with me.
And then I'm an exaggerate what he did

487
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,020
and I'm going to profit off of it.
Yeah,

488
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:14,540
I mean,
do you,

489
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:17,770
you don't understand that they've paid
fucking millions of dollars to people.

490
00:22:17,771 --> 00:22:22,600
So there's a real industry and getting
bill o'reilly to get creepy with you.

491
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:24,760
Like I was a chick,
like,

492
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:28,120
especially if I was like a really
unscrupulous chick,

493
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,400
he tied my knee.
That's half a million.

494
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,320
He wants to confide.
That's a million and a half.

495
00:22:32,321 --> 00:22:34,240
This guy's a Douche bag,
but this is what I'm gonna do.

496
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,050
I'm just going to like kind of give him
like a semi green light,

497
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:39,263
you know,
just a little bit.

498
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:41,030
I take it back a little bit,
take it back.

499
00:22:41,031 --> 00:22:43,630
And the problem is though,
that this kind of skepticism towards

500
00:22:43,631 --> 00:22:45,790
women's stories about sexual assault
has,

501
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:49,390
is what has pr permitted?
People like him to get away with it for

502
00:22:49,391 --> 00:22:50,770
decades and centuries.
Right?

503
00:22:50,771 --> 00:22:52,840
Like it doesn't agree with you.
I take your point that it's hot

504
00:22:52,841 --> 00:22:53,531
happening.
You know,

505
00:22:53,531 --> 00:22:54,251
it's just a,
he said,

506
00:22:54,251 --> 00:22:56,920
she said,
I don't think that's what I think power

507
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:00,550
has gotten,
allowed them to get away with it.

508
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:03,730
I think fear and power,
the fear of this powerful man,

509
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:07,150
I think that has been the doesn't work.
You're not being believed part of that.

510
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:11,560
Maybe I think the repercussions that
he's going to ruin your career,

511
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:13,150
that he's going to,
that he has influence.

512
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:16,540
And also that if you just play ball,
you'll get something from it.

513
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,650
You know?
I mean,

514
00:23:17,651 --> 00:23:18,940
I'm not,
especially,

515
00:23:18,941 --> 00:23:22,120
I'm not talking about an individual
person and saying this individual person

516
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:24,310
not telling the truth.
What I'm doing is just making

517
00:23:24,311 --> 00:23:28,000
hypothetical's.
I'm just saying if I was a check and I

518
00:23:28,001 --> 00:23:28,780
was,
uh,

519
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:33,100
an unscrupulous sort of social climber
and we all know that they exist,

520
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:37,420
and I was the type of person that really
wanted to make it in this business,

521
00:23:37,421 --> 00:23:38,260
and I was like,
look,

522
00:23:38,261 --> 00:23:42,070
I'm working for an asshole and I already
know this five chicks we got paid.

523
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,140
They've already paid out 13 million
bucks.

524
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:46,130
I'm going to,
I'm going to and move in on this.

525
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:49,580
I'm interested that that route that
turned on him.

526
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:52,790
Then Rupert Murdoch turned on him and
kicked him out when he's still making a

527
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:55,400
ton of money.
He's still the number one cable show.

528
00:23:55,401 --> 00:23:56,360
Right?
Or he was,

529
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:58,160
well,
maybe Tucker Carlson had a meeting with

530
00:23:58,161 --> 00:23:59,570
him,
pulled him aside.

531
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:00,770
They listen.
Fuck God.

532
00:24:00,771 --> 00:24:04,560
That tide comes in and out.
Jesus fucking

533
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:12,470
speaking of someone who will say
whatever they think their audience wants

534
00:24:12,471 --> 00:24:14,400
them to say,
Taka.

535
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,760
That's,
he got right there with his stupid old

536
00:24:16,761 --> 00:24:17,970
bow tie.
He doesn't have a bow.

537
00:24:17,971 --> 00:24:18,670
Tiny one.
It's no,

538
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:20,310
he got rid of it soon.
It's a straight time.

539
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,740
Yeah.
Both ties to gay.

540
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,500
Exactly.
Don't be associated with that.

541
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:27,520
Or clowns or you know,
someone who's got like a camera in it.

542
00:24:27,521 --> 00:24:29,930
It's,
I'm amazed that he's had his renaissance

543
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,860
taka like he was there was that classic
John Stewart moment when he used to host

544
00:24:33,861 --> 00:24:34,694
crossfire.

545
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:37,010
Chuck Tucker Carlson and John went on,
he was like,

546
00:24:37,011 --> 00:24:40,160
you're a grown man wearing a bow tie,
stop hurting America.

547
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:46,280
The Johnston in that regard where he was
funny on his show when he was doing a

548
00:24:46,281 --> 00:24:49,240
scripted monologue and talking to people
who was gracious but did view,

549
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:52,400
if he came on your show and he had an
issue with you,

550
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:56,810
you would find out how fucking smart and
mean he could really go after you.

551
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,010
Absolutely.
Which is,

552
00:24:58,011 --> 00:25:00,080
which is good cause I mean Taco.
Yeah.

553
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:02,750
Would it be to think about whether or
not bill o'reilly believes what he

554
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:04,010
believes?
I don't think tuck a nose.

555
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:07,130
Like taco has this constant faith.
He has this have,

556
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:09,470
you know,
if you're listening to audio podcasts,

557
00:25:09,471 --> 00:25:12,290
you can see my face,
but it's kind of furrowed brow and like

558
00:25:12,291 --> 00:25:14,000
mouth breathing,
kind of like,

559
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:14,690
you know,
he,

560
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:17,720
he,
he plays the role of like the bemused

561
00:25:17,721 --> 00:25:21,630
clown who doesn't know who's just,
I'm just a common man from mine,

562
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,000
just middle America.

563
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,340
I don't understand what you're talking
about.

564
00:25:25,341 --> 00:25:27,080
And he's like very,
very,

565
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,530
very riding the fence,
very kind of riding the fence.

566
00:25:30,531 --> 00:25:33,650
Very like never quite having an,
I'm just missed a common sense.

567
00:25:33,651 --> 00:25:37,100
Like I'm just saying it like I see it
anyway.

568
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:41,480
I don't know.
I would assume that a lot of these women

569
00:25:41,481 --> 00:25:42,760
were telling the truth.
No one.

570
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:44,990
I'm not,
I'm definitely not saying that they

571
00:25:44,991 --> 00:25:46,460
weren't telling the truth.
What I'm saying is,

572
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,680
I don't know.
I don't know what happened or what

573
00:25:48,681 --> 00:25:50,390
didn't happen.
I don't know whether he should be fired

574
00:25:50,391 --> 00:25:52,160
or shouldn't be fired.
You mean?

575
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:55,400
Uh,
I think he feels that he fills a niche.

576
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:58,910
Right.
And if it's my company and you have to

577
00:25:58,911 --> 00:26:01,130
worry about this guy representing you.
Oh,

578
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,240
okay.
I see.

579
00:26:02,241 --> 00:26:04,070
Where you wouldn't want that guy
representing you because he's

580
00:26:04,071 --> 00:26:06,050
problematic and people think he's a
creep.

581
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:09,290
But he could just go do his own shit.
Like Glenn Beck,

582
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:12,950
he little Horn antic of course he wish
or something and he's not going to go

583
00:26:12,951 --> 00:26:15,440
away quietly.
I mean it's an interesting,

584
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,710
it's an interesting question about what
happens to the right wing media now.

585
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:23,300
Cause if Roger ailes is no longer at Fox
News and Bill O'reilly is no longer at

586
00:26:23,301 --> 00:26:25,640
Fox News for the same reason,
for the same reason,

587
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,480
but exactly both guys the same.
The plays into the same narrative

588
00:26:29,481 --> 00:26:32,630
doesn't let of dirty old white guy.
Just a fuck fest going on over there at

589
00:26:32,631 --> 00:26:35,870
Fox News may him just young women.
It's like an old,

590
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:40,460
like an old porky's movie or like one of
those 1970s national lampoon films with

591
00:26:40,461 --> 00:26:42,140
women with their tits hanging,
hanging out.

592
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:46,180
People are to the dorm tweeten and
Hannity now your next handed it.

593
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:46,711
Yeah,
exactly.

594
00:26:46,711 --> 00:26:50,520
You're going after him now and
Breitbart's had its dude Steve Bannon

595
00:26:50,521 --> 00:26:51,810
sideline in the White House.

596
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:54,330
So if he can't get along with trump
anymore,

597
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,700
is that true?
I don't know.

598
00:26:55,701 --> 00:26:56,910
I don't,
I'm not friends with him.

599
00:26:57,570 --> 00:26:59,490
I love rumors.
I don't call him up.

600
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,290
Hey Steve.
Hey stevie,

601
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:02,990
Stevie Bay.
How you doing?

602
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:05,040
How are you doing with that?
With Donnie these days?

603
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:08,070
How are you guys still close?
Jared is running the show now.

604
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,170
That's right.
And I think he had to make a decision

605
00:27:10,171 --> 00:27:13,090
and he kind of sideline to the,
the white nationalists a bit.

606
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,710
Any kind of empowered the old school
Republican orthodoxy.

607
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:18,120
Gee,
you'd be pissed if you were a trump

608
00:27:18,121 --> 00:27:18,954
voter,
wouldn't you?

609
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:21,900
Did have a Jew running shit.
Well not just to have a job.

610
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,780
Doesn't help.
Joe's doesn't help.

611
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:27,660
But no,
I just mean like so much of what he sort

612
00:27:27,661 --> 00:27:29,400
of ran on was like,
it's going to be different.

613
00:27:29,401 --> 00:27:32,290
It's not going to be the same old
politics and now you know we're going to

614
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,200
repeal obamacare.
Well that didn't work out.

615
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:37,380
That's just going to be tax co.
Now he bombed Syria where you weren't

616
00:27:37,381 --> 00:27:39,720
supposed to be bombing people.
I thought we were going to get out of

617
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:43,010
all these foreign wars and shit.
Don't care like that

618
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,530
many people,
they,

619
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:49,040
they have this cognitive dissonance that
they have in addressing his actions as

620
00:27:49,041 --> 00:27:51,020
so they're,
they're the support of him.

621
00:27:51,021 --> 00:27:53,450
They're so happy that they won.
They would,

622
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,640
they would never want to take away their
victory.

623
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:59,330
Like the people that are happy that
trump is in office are so happy that he

624
00:27:59,331 --> 00:28:04,250
won and they won with him.
That any little thing that happens,

625
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:07,220
they just come up with some sort of a
way to rational

626
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,210
some of them do.
Some of them do.

627
00:28:09,211 --> 00:28:13,200
I start a story the other day about a,
about a county in Pennsylvania or

628
00:28:13,201 --> 00:28:14,034
something which is,
uh,

629
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:17,100
which had voted for Obama twice and then
voted for trump because they thought

630
00:28:17,101 --> 00:28:19,170
they were going to get changed and
they're all just like,

631
00:28:19,171 --> 00:28:21,030
well,
he just seems like a regular Republican.

632
00:28:21,031 --> 00:28:23,930
He's going to try to attack cut taxes
for the rich and go,

633
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:26,610
go to war with foreign countries,
isn't from what this is and what we

634
00:28:26,611 --> 00:28:28,830
bargained for.
But it'll be interesting to see whether

635
00:28:28,831 --> 00:28:33,831
or not they flip back and four years.
I take your point that they're just

636
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:36,000
really happy that hillary is not the
president.

637
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:37,770
There's a lot of people that are really
happy.

638
00:28:37,771 --> 00:28:40,200
She's not the president.
I think bill's the biggest,

639
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:43,630
I think bill's super happy.
It's like fine.

640
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:47,390
I didn't want to have to go back.
I don't know.

641
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:50,040
There was a law.
The tail in that house.

642
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,970
He gets plenty of tail.
Yeah.

643
00:28:51,971 --> 00:28:54,430
Betty downside side.
Did you see all that Sheila Riley

644
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:58,720
political system in the wikileaks memos
about the Commonwealth.

645
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:03,990
What was talking about him banging
hookers on the side was like talking

646
00:29:04,001 --> 00:29:08,290
about how bills at home banging bimbos
and there was some thing about me,

647
00:29:08,291 --> 00:29:10,990
Colin Powell is just fucking blitz it in
emails.

648
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,470
They talk shit like just like regular
people.

649
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:18,370
Yeah.
Don't put it in an email very well and

650
00:29:18,371 --> 00:29:22,300
we learned nothing.
Don't send it to fucking anybody who's

651
00:29:22,301 --> 00:29:23,500
got an insecure server.

652
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:26,090
No.
Well just don't write it down at all and

653
00:29:26,091 --> 00:29:27,890
not even get kind of rarely talk now
anyway.

654
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:29,380
Cause that means that you're going to be
spied.

655
00:29:29,381 --> 00:29:30,214
Yeah.

656
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:33,890
How are we going to have a private
conversations to just to just pull shit

657
00:29:33,891 --> 00:29:38,120
on people just let it fly.
This like what we've said here,

658
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:40,820
cause usually have been in a,
in a private email.

659
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:43,210
Yup that's right.
Questioning whether or not bill

660
00:29:43,211 --> 00:29:46,210
o'reilly's intelligent or whether or not
he really believes that or whether or

661
00:29:46,211 --> 00:29:48,550
not in a religious people are actually
intelligent,

662
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:52,000
which I f you know clearly there there's
a lot of religious people that are

663
00:29:52,001 --> 00:29:55,750
intelligent and I mean part of the
problem is that people give too much of

664
00:29:55,751 --> 00:29:57,850
a crap about things that people have
said in the past.

665
00:29:57,851 --> 00:30:01,090
I mean we've spoken about this before in
relation to political correctness or

666
00:30:01,091 --> 00:30:03,040
something or like using the wrong
language.

667
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:07,970
I think as more and more of what we say
gets intercepted or at least in

668
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:12,980
susceptible in emails and also in phone
calls and so on and we're being spied on

669
00:30:13,001 --> 00:30:15,460
all the time and things can be leaked
and things can be hacked.

670
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:18,880
People are just going to have to chill
the fuck out a little bit about people's

671
00:30:18,881 --> 00:30:20,680
past.
Otherwise we're only going to end up

672
00:30:20,681 --> 00:30:24,850
with the most boring anodyne and people
in positions of power because it's only

673
00:30:24,851 --> 00:30:27,490
going to be people who've always watched
exactly what they say,

674
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:30,410
who are able to,
who have never kind of triggered a trip

675
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:34,030
wire and who have never gotten people
angry and just sense trumps the big

676
00:30:34,031 --> 00:30:35,350
victory for that.
That's right.

677
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:38,370
You see what I said after trump was
elected that political correct.

678
00:30:38,371 --> 00:30:41,320
It's just took a missile to the Dick.
Absolutely.

679
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:43,510
This is just,
it just shows you,

680
00:30:43,511 --> 00:30:48,460
you could be out there and grabbing
pussies talking crap fucking people,

681
00:30:48,461 --> 00:30:49,540
man.
It's okay.

682
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:50,980
Like it's,
it's not,

683
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:54,580
it's the world has changed in that
regard and part of the,

684
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,930
I mean part of the problem there is that
the things that he,

685
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:00,190
some of the things that he says really I
ad like,

686
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:03,190
I don't think that it's appropriate to
be to,

687
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,650
to talk about women the way that he
talks about women.

688
00:31:05,651 --> 00:31:06,730
I don't think it's appropriate.

689
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:12,340
Basically.
Basically the problem with that is he's

690
00:31:12,341 --> 00:31:14,680
talking to a dude and trying to make
them laugh.

691
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:15,551
Yeah.
I mean,

692
00:31:15,551 --> 00:31:19,150
he's having a private conversation with
a guy and he's doing what he called

693
00:31:19,151 --> 00:31:21,550
locker room talk.
Guys Talk Shit.

694
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,340
And they say things they don't really
mean and he's,

695
00:31:24,341 --> 00:31:25,990
what he said was,
and I'm not,

696
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,600
I'm not an apologist,
just let me get this out of the way.

697
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:32,080
What he said was,
you can just grab them by the Pussy.

698
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,780
They let you,
you can do anything that you want when

699
00:31:34,781 --> 00:31:37,090
you were a big celebrity.
He just grabbed him by the pussy.

700
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:41,890
Like what he's saying is not,
I grab women by the Pussy and sexually

701
00:31:41,891 --> 00:31:43,000
assault them.
Well,

702
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:47,020
he's just being totally outrageous.
It's like a punchline for a joke.

703
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,990
He's exaggerating the reality of the
situation.

704
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:54,010
He's saying he's so famous saying,
when you're as famous as me,

705
00:31:54,011 --> 00:31:55,030
you can do anything.

706
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:58,120
You can grab them by the pussy thing.
He's trying that you,

707
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:00,970
he's saying they let you meaning
implying consent.

708
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,860
Right.
And I say he's not talking about sexual

709
00:32:02,861 --> 00:32:03,331
assault.
What's,

710
00:32:03,331 --> 00:32:04,450
so when people were saying,
you know,

711
00:32:04,451 --> 00:32:05,980
he's doing sexual assault.
No,

712
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:09,040
he's talking about girls that are in
thrawled with the fact that they're

713
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,800
around.
This guy was his fucking name on

714
00:32:11,801 --> 00:32:14,890
skyscrapers and he flies around with a
jet with his name on it.

715
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:18,010
And if you're that type of woman and
there are that look,

716
00:32:18,011 --> 00:32:20,410
there's that type of men.
There's that type of women were not,

717
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:25,440
it does not a gross generalization about
men or women but guaranteed your son

718
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:29,260
some women that when they're in the face
of a guy like Donald Trump,

719
00:32:29,261 --> 00:32:31,840
they react that way and they let him do
anything they want and they love it.

720
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,220
Yeah,
there is that possibility.

721
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:35,920
There is that possibility.
I also thought that the phrasing of that

722
00:32:35,921 --> 00:32:38,770
term was,
it was kind of funny like yeah they let

723
00:32:38,771 --> 00:32:40,100
you grab them but like how

724
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:43,100
do you grab it to see exactly like where
do your fingers go?

725
00:32:43,101 --> 00:32:43,934
Like,
well,

726
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:47,600
when does this some who's doing like,
so what?

727
00:32:47,601 --> 00:32:51,290
It sounded to me like with someone who
is inept sexually,

728
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:54,410
which by many accounts he is like,
there are lots of accounts of like when

729
00:32:54,411 --> 00:32:56,780
he was married to or dating the most
beautiful people,

730
00:32:56,781 --> 00:32:59,170
he'd be downstairs eating Cheetos,
watching late night news,

731
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:04,420
cable news while they were upstairs.
Like not believe that will because well

732
00:33:04,461 --> 00:33:06,140
just,
just compare it to whether or not it

733
00:33:06,141 --> 00:33:08,180
comports with what,
what else do you know about him,

734
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:12,680
which is that he's very image focused
and cares a lot about being thought to

735
00:33:12,681 --> 00:33:15,830
be the best at everything and the most
glamorous and the richest.

736
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:18,140
So it's,
you would imagine that it would be

737
00:33:18,141 --> 00:33:21,320
consistent with his personality,
that he would want to present a front of

738
00:33:21,321 --> 00:33:25,750
being more of a slayer and more of a
sexual demon than he actually is sexual

739
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:26,623
bands.

740
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,020
It's a great name for a band.
It's the sites.

741
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,450
So the grab them by the Pussy.
It sort of reminded me a little bit of

742
00:33:32,451 --> 00:33:34,370
the way that 15 year old boys would talk
to each other.

743
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,380
Yeah,
Dude.

744
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:40,040
Or two
guys say ridiculous things that they

745
00:33:40,041 --> 00:33:42,290
don't mean you get other people to
laugh.

746
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,520
I will,
I will grant you that.

747
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,230
Girls do too.
I mean,

748
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:48,380
my point about political correctness is
that I don't think trump has is our

749
00:33:48,381 --> 00:33:49,490
best,
uh,

750
00:33:49,491 --> 00:33:52,700
ambassador for the anti political
correctness brigade.

751
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,370
Like,
and part of his rise,

752
00:33:55,371 --> 00:33:59,180
part of the backlash is a backlash
against the,

753
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:00,860
you know,
we've had so many conversations that we

754
00:34:00,861 --> 00:34:04,460
all know it by now with we're bored of
like people who go,

755
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:07,280
who absolutely lose their,
you know,

756
00:34:07,281 --> 00:34:11,030
just go crazy because you use the wrong
transgender pronoun or something like

757
00:34:11,031 --> 00:34:11,740
that.
You know,

758
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:15,150
you say he instead of she or whatever it
is all these times or microaggressions

759
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:18,710
and stuff like that,
or all of that kind of bullshit,

760
00:34:18,711 --> 00:34:21,650
I think gave rise to an environment in
which people are so frustrated with

761
00:34:21,651 --> 00:34:23,750
political correctness that they
unleashed.

762
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,720
And it was like a pressure cooker
exploding and,

763
00:34:25,721 --> 00:34:27,950
and the trump hair went everywhere and
just trump,

764
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,300
he's the,
yeah,

765
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,850
exactly.
But I don't think it'd be,

766
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:32,120
you know,
things would have been better if we

767
00:34:32,121 --> 00:34:34,460
hadn't gotten to that place.
And we could all just take a chill pill.

768
00:34:34,461 --> 00:34:36,020
I think we need to learn,
you know,

769
00:34:36,021 --> 00:34:39,380
and I think we need to make mistakes so
that we can learn.

770
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:43,220
One of the things that's really
unfortunate is that he doesn't tell the

771
00:34:43,221 --> 00:34:47,750
truth and that he's the president and he
shows that you can just not tell the

772
00:34:47,751 --> 00:34:49,340
truth and be the president.
Yeah.

773
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:52,880
About all kinds of things.
The alternative facts analogy,

774
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:57,530
you know what I mean?
I'm trying to grapple with this on my

775
00:34:57,531 --> 00:34:58,800
podcast.
Um,

776
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,370
because I think it's,
I think what's,

777
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:04,400
what's dangerous about trump is that is
not just that he,

778
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:07,460
he doesn't tell the truth because lots
of people point out,

779
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:09,230
many politicians don't tell the truth.

780
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:14,660
It's that he doesn't even care that he's
not telling the truth and he doesn't

781
00:35:14,661 --> 00:35:18,260
behave as if there is such a thing.
Really as truth.

782
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:23,390
Like the other day he talked about the,
the warships that were heading for the

783
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:24,260
Korean Peninsula.
Did you see this,

784
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:28,010
this story?
He said that we've got this aircraft

785
00:35:28,011 --> 00:35:29,900
carrier,
which is going towards Korea.

786
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:35,630
It was going in the opposite direction
to Australia to not attack Australia.

787
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:39,740
But do I have a military exercise with
the ozzies and now and then Sean Spicer

788
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:41,700
got there,
you know the press corps went crazy and

789
00:35:41,701 --> 00:35:43,740
the White House correspondence and Sean
Spicer was like,

790
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:47,490
well I agree.
He was saying that it had been heading,

791
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:52,670
it was going to be going to the Korean
Peninsula but it was just do on a DJ.

792
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:55,560
So he wasn't saying the actual direction
of the aircraft carrier.

793
00:35:55,561 --> 00:35:58,290
He was saying that it was,
he was talking about the overall

794
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:03,590
strategy of what and like poor old spicy
is out there trying to make trump

795
00:36:04,791 --> 00:36:09,030
statements comport with something with
reality in some way.

796
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:14,310
But trump is just an explosive like
vomit machine just tweeting out stuff

797
00:36:14,311 --> 00:36:17,100
that doesn't even have to map onto
reality at all.

798
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:21,480
And he always seems to take pride I
think in the fact that he can say

799
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,390
whatever million people at the
inauguration.

800
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:27,740
When I started talking the rain stopped
and the sun.

801
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:29,760
That was pretty good.
Are you working on that show?

802
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:32,490
No,
I like the impression that needs work.

803
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:34,320
It needs a little work,
but everyone's got their trump.

804
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,333
But you know what I mean?
He,

805
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:40,430
he will say things and then almost take,
I feel like he gets his Joel,

806
00:36:40,941 --> 00:36:45,690
he gets his rocks off through the sheer
audacity of being able to say whatever

807
00:36:45,691 --> 00:36:49,590
the hell he wants and just make his
opponents go crazy because they don't

808
00:36:49,591 --> 00:36:51,780
even get to a game of whack a mall then.
Right.

809
00:36:51,781 --> 00:36:53,010
It's like,
well,

810
00:36:53,011 --> 00:36:55,300
you said,
that's true.

811
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,620
So he's acting as a politician for the
first time in his life and he's 70.

812
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:03,060
So for his entire life he's been this
braggadocious guy who is exaggerated

813
00:37:03,061 --> 00:37:06,810
facts and built up this amazing persona
and exaggerated wealth and he's

814
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:09,960
obviously very successful but
exaggerates that success.

815
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:12,080
So like the thing about him winning the
inauguration,

816
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:16,110
remember that really interesting
exchange that he had with a reporter.

817
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,180
It was young reporter and he was up
there saying,

818
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:22,590
we won by the largest margin now blah,
just margin in the electoral college.

819
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,990
That's not true.
And he said,

820
00:37:24,991 --> 00:37:26,280
well,
the law just for,

821
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,420
um,
Republican,

822
00:37:27,421 --> 00:37:28,950
a Republican.
And that's also true.

823
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,360
So he said,
George H.

824
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:33,330
Bush or George Herbert Walker Bush had
much larger margin.

825
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,370
And so he explained to him,
well,

826
00:37:35,371 --> 00:37:37,440
you will agree that we won by
substantial number.

827
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,000
Yeah,
well you are the president.

828
00:37:39,001 --> 00:37:40,540
Thank you.
He was like,

829
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:42,180
good,
I want tic TAC toe.

830
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:43,530
Exactly.
It's just,

831
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:47,130
it's just he's not a politician and
that's what people like about them,

832
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:48,810
you know?
But then he starts doing all these

833
00:37:48,811 --> 00:37:50,220
different things like,
you know,

834
00:37:50,221 --> 00:37:55,221
he's trying to get all these different
plants to reopen and give Americans jobs

835
00:37:55,291 --> 00:37:58,080
and they talk about all the jobs that
have been created and people get excited

836
00:37:58,081 --> 00:37:59,760
and they signed this new thing
yesterday.

837
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:00,631
Uh,
you know,

838
00:38:00,631 --> 00:38:04,200
American made American sales and try to
encourage people to buy and make

839
00:38:04,201 --> 00:38:07,320
American and,
and then trying to get rid of foreigners

840
00:38:07,321 --> 00:38:10,680
that are sneaking over here and doing
bad things and you know,

841
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:13,530
the base,
the people that have been clamoring for

842
00:38:13,531 --> 00:38:15,990
that kind of response get very excited.
That's cool.

843
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:16,411
We'll,
we'll,

844
00:38:16,411 --> 00:38:18,240
we'll deal with the lies.
The lies are fine.

845
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:20,280
As long as he opens up that Ford plant,
they'll,

846
00:38:20,281 --> 00:38:21,360
the lies are bad.
But look,

847
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:23,940
he got those,
a Guatemalan terrorists,

848
00:38:23,941 --> 00:38:26,820
drug dealers out of Chicago or whatever.
You know what I mean?

849
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:27,710
Yeah.
And I think the,

850
00:38:27,711 --> 00:38:30,620
I think that there's a feeling that the
whole people who regard themselves as

851
00:38:30,621 --> 00:38:33,740
being custodians of the truth,
a Hoity toity out of touch,

852
00:38:33,741 --> 00:38:36,640
a Leitz who've been shitting the trump
support,

853
00:38:36,641 --> 00:38:38,800
the honest,
hardworking trump supporter for so long

854
00:38:38,801 --> 00:38:42,760
that they deserve to be slapped in their
face with a little bit of untruthful

855
00:38:42,761 --> 00:38:43,820
truthiness.
Sure.

856
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:48,620
And the judges and the academics people
smarter than you.

857
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:50,790
Yeah.
People more educated than you and her

858
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:53,630
spitting social acts and it makes you
humiliated.

859
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,170
I feel dumb.
Yeah.

860
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:57,500
Like the tide goes in,
the tide goes out to explain it.

861
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,710
It's kind of the same appeal.
Yeah,

862
00:38:59,711 --> 00:39:01,980
that's right.
That's right.

863
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:09,500
I mean that people do love when liberals
get their comeuppance.

864
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:14,980
Liberals are really classically
associated with education,

865
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:18,620
higher education,
bigger vocabularies,

866
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:19,610
universities.

867
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:22,760
Funny things about trump that he's the
anti elitist as if the,

868
00:39:22,761 --> 00:39:27,510
as if it is non elite to be a Manhattan
real estate billionaire.

869
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:29,880
How has that,
how has that,

870
00:39:29,881 --> 00:39:32,060
the anti elite,
you just have to say anything.

871
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:34,590
When Rowan,
George Bush pretended he was from

872
00:39:34,591 --> 00:39:37,770
fucking Texas.
Lot of people don't realize he's from,

873
00:39:37,771 --> 00:39:38,870
yeah,
he's from the northeast.

874
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:40,170
He went to Yale.
Yeah.

875
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:44,590
He all he did in Texas was clear brush
and brush it.

876
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:45,830
And when people are looking,
Yep.

877
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,350
Camera's rolling.
Absolutely.

878
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:51,180
Chainsawing down trees.
But it's,

879
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,800
you know,
it's the American way.

880
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:56,990
You pitch people an image.
I mean it is why they have publicists.

881
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:57,833
Why,

882
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:01,440
I mean when you say though that trump is
like he's not a politician and that's

883
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:03,020
what people like about him.
Yeah.

884
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:07,410
There's the worry is that when you're
president of the United States,

885
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:11,530
shit you say has any impact,
right?

886
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,410
It is an important position.
So things,

887
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:17,670
things that you say can be
misinterpreted by the Koreans or the

888
00:40:17,671 --> 00:40:19,470
Russians.
And there's a,

889
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:24,420
like if you are the president,
you should know that people in the

890
00:40:24,421 --> 00:40:27,180
executive branch,
such as the president of people in the

891
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:29,100
White House,
should not disparage people in the

892
00:40:29,101 --> 00:40:31,110
judicial branch.
Right.

893
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:33,660
Because we have a separation of powers
in the United States of America.

894
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,960
So when he made those comments,
for example about the judiciary,

895
00:40:36,961 --> 00:40:38,850
I think a lot of people think like,
oh,

896
00:40:38,851 --> 00:40:41,040
why is everyone getting their tits on a
tangle about them?

897
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:42,960
Just because he said that the judge was
a,

898
00:40:42,961 --> 00:40:45,030
you know,
implied that the judge was biased in the

899
00:40:45,031 --> 00:40:46,230
trump university case.

900
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:51,360
It's because presidential candidates
shouldn't be shitting on judges because

901
00:40:51,361 --> 00:40:55,140
otherwise you end up with situations
like you've got in Venezuela or now in

902
00:40:55,141 --> 00:40:56,760
Turkey,
they've just had this referendum over

903
00:40:56,761 --> 00:40:59,610
the past weekend,
which gave sort of quasi dictatorial

904
00:40:59,611 --> 00:41:04,611
powers to Turkey's president.
Similar things happening in Turkey come

905
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:07,230
dictatorships essentially,
essentially.

906
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:10,680
And Russia has done that over the past
10 or 15 years.

907
00:41:10,681 --> 00:41:12,780
And when you listen to people who are
experts in these things,

908
00:41:12,781 --> 00:41:14,820
they always say,
I was just listening to Masha Gessen

909
00:41:14,821 --> 00:41:15,541
who's really into,
you know,

910
00:41:15,541 --> 00:41:18,090
Marcia,
she's a Russian journalist who lives in

911
00:41:18,091 --> 00:41:20,130
the states now.
Fascinating person.

912
00:41:20,131 --> 00:41:21,780
She'd be a good person to get to get on
the show.

913
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:24,800
And she was saying that the,
the,

914
00:41:24,801 --> 00:41:27,500
the things that,
that nice and to dictators always liked

915
00:41:27,501 --> 00:41:29,700
to do is take,
take down a peg.

916
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,560
People who,
uh,

917
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,250
who,
who rely facts for their living.

918
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:37,850
So that's journalists.
It's people in the judicial department

919
00:41:37,851 --> 00:41:39,800
and his academics.
So it's judges,

920
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:41,960
lawyers,
academics and so on.

921
00:41:41,961 --> 00:41:44,630
That's always what you see.
Like the Putin's and again,

922
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:47,270
the sort of bill o'reilly mindset of
like tide goes in,

923
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:48,230
tide goes out,
hey,

924
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:50,900
I'm just a regular guy.
I've got my gut going for me.

925
00:41:50,901 --> 00:41:52,760
I don't need all these fancy book
learning.

926
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:55,880
It's just you and me.
Let's go to Washington DC and take it

927
00:41:55,881 --> 00:41:59,390
back from those fancy elites making
America great,

928
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:00,980
right?
And we're going to do it just without

929
00:42:00,981 --> 00:42:02,510
balls.
We're going to grab them by the Pussy

930
00:42:02,511 --> 00:42:05,210
and we're going to drag this country
until the 21st century come.

931
00:42:05,211 --> 00:42:08,290
What may you should run for office,
goddammit,

932
00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:10,730
you're phone out of the country.
That's a stupid rule.

933
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:14,060
It is America.
Most countries don't have that natural

934
00:42:14,061 --> 00:42:15,170
bone rule.
Most countries,

935
00:42:15,171 --> 00:42:19,100
if you move to that country and you
become a citizen and you live there for

936
00:42:19,101 --> 00:42:21,730
a certain period of time,
sure you can move from the highest

937
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:23,630
office to run for office and all
offended.

938
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,760
Would you run for office if it was
available?

939
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:28,510
I think I can run for office.
I think I can't run for president.

940
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:30,320
Obviously Arnold Schwarzenegger was
governor.

941
00:42:30,321 --> 00:42:31,520
That's correct.
Exactly.

942
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:36,200
So I hereby announce my candidacy for
the governorship of California.

943
00:42:36,201 --> 00:42:37,670
Joe Rogan even live here.
Dude,

944
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,470
I do now.
When did you move?

945
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:41,840
I move.
I've kind of oozed between New York and

946
00:42:41,841 --> 00:42:43,910
Los Angeles over the course of the past
four months.

947
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:47,490
But you're an elite by coastal guy
wearing an accent.

948
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:50,570
You hear elite by coastal guy and from
another country.

949
00:42:50,571 --> 00:42:51,590
Look,
if I was al Qaeda,

950
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:53,570
I know.
I would say the way to get somebody to

951
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:56,750
slip them in is not to get some brown
guy who looks like an Arab,

952
00:42:57,130 --> 00:42:58,610
nosy,
handsome Ozzie.

953
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,780
No one's going to think that the an
Aussie,

954
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:03,140
especially a gay wasn't exactly.
That's right.

955
00:43:03,141 --> 00:43:05,560
I'm married having twins,
Joe.

956
00:43:05,561 --> 00:43:06,650
Oh my goodness.
How?

957
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,000
How's that work?

958
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,960
It's very complicated.
Do you have somebody that carries them

959
00:43:11,961 --> 00:43:12,600
for you?
Yeah.

960
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:13,700
Does she live with,
you know?

961
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:14,780
Oh,
that's weird.

962
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:15,950
Yeah,
that's extra sheets,

963
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,210
right?
Yeah.

964
00:43:17,211 --> 00:43:19,210
We're trying.
That's how you don't want to be

965
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:22,430
controlling who's just,
did you choose?

966
00:43:22,431 --> 00:43:24,660
We used,
we used my edges because we used

967
00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:25,720
because,
uh,

968
00:43:25,721 --> 00:43:26,690
um,
cause you're the boss.

969
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:28,070
I'm the boss.
Exactly.

970
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:32,570
Are you the dad figured that out yet?
I didn't say we had twins yet.

971
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:35,090
They're in the oven.
I have a couple that lives down the

972
00:43:35,091 --> 00:43:37,340
street from me.
They're gay couple and I've known them

973
00:43:37,341 --> 00:43:39,600
for probably about 15 years.
And uh,

974
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:41,360
they have a child and I'm watching this
kid grow.

975
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:43,910
They went through the whole thing and
they went through the whole thing.

976
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:47,450
Their kids friends with my kid and has
been since it was a baby and he's about

977
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,790
seven or eight now.

978
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:55,070
And they went through the whole thing
where they had a surrogate,

979
00:43:55,071 --> 00:43:56,690
the whole deal.
She carries it and then at the end of it

980
00:43:56,691 --> 00:43:57,980
she's like,
I'm keeping this.

981
00:43:58,190 --> 00:43:59,300
Oh Wow.
Yeah.

982
00:43:59,301 --> 00:44:02,270
They paid for the kids and that was
Kosha.

983
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:04,920
She won.
I mean she got it.

984
00:44:05,970 --> 00:44:08,270
Do you know,
because you know that's unusual because

985
00:44:08,271 --> 00:44:11,000
California is usually outside.
It gets not in California,

986
00:44:11,001 --> 00:44:13,160
but you,
it tends to have pretty good,

987
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:16,490
uh,
pro family surrogacy laws by which I

988
00:44:16,491 --> 00:44:18,250
mean it makes it hard for the,
sorry,

989
00:44:18,251 --> 00:44:23,120
I get to change your mind at the,
at the end we'll they did in 2000 it was

990
00:44:23,121 --> 00:44:26,350
like early 2000 Oh yeah.
That might changed somewhere in do

991
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:28,670
bloody Australia.
I mean,

992
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:32,040
let me whine for a moment about how
backward Australia was 10 or 15

993
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,960
years ago when I first started coming to
the states,

994
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:39,030
I was able to look down my progressive
knows at these fine United States of

995
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:41,700
America and think of it as being a more
conservative center,

996
00:44:41,701 --> 00:44:44,580
right country.
But now you guys are legalizing pot all

997
00:44:44,581 --> 00:44:46,140
over the joint.
You've got the gay marriage.

998
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:50,640
Australia still doesn't like a lot of,
I feel like a lot of interesting stuff

999
00:44:50,641 --> 00:44:54,390
is going on in the states,
in on the progressive side of politics

1000
00:44:54,391 --> 00:44:57,630
and culture that Australia has just been
too slow to pick up.

1001
00:44:57,631 --> 00:44:59,490
So on the,
on the question of surrogacy,

1002
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:04,620
there's this weird like alliance in
Australia that also exist in some

1003
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:09,890
communities here in the states between
essentially extreme feminists and like

1004
00:45:10,021 --> 00:45:15,021
right wing Christians to say that women
should not be allowed to take money to b

1005
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:21,690
Sarragut carriers from the Christian
riot.

1006
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,310
They say,
you know,

1007
00:45:23,311 --> 00:45:24,930
we shouldn't let these fags,
you know,

1008
00:45:24,931 --> 00:45:27,690
be using women to about an hour to
create life,

1009
00:45:28,090 --> 00:45:30,810
God forbid.
And from the feminists it's,

1010
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:32,940
Oh,
we have to protect women from being

1011
00:45:32,941 --> 00:45:37,560
manipulated and taking money for having,
for renting their wounds out.

1012
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:41,830
But you want them to have the right to
kill a,

1013
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:43,230
an unborn baby.

1014
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:44,530
No,
no,

1015
00:45:44,530 --> 00:45:45,341
no.
It's not that.

1016
00:45:45,341 --> 00:45:47,410
It's what you don't want.
It's a medical procedure.

1017
00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:51,300
It's not telling you baby,
it's a bundle of cells until it comes to

1018
00:45:51,310 --> 00:45:54,490
batch of cells and then all of a sudden
until it gets a social security number.

1019
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:55,353
Yeah,
not real.

1020
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:58,210
So you want a woman to be able to kill
that bunch of cells,

1021
00:45:58,211 --> 00:46:00,520
but you don't want her to be able to
bring that bunch of cells into

1022
00:46:00,521 --> 00:46:02,500
existence,
then get paid for it.

1023
00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:03,460
In Australia.
You can't.

1024
00:46:03,461 --> 00:46:07,440
It's against the law to be pet to,
to pay a surrogate to carry your child.

1025
00:46:07,441 --> 00:46:08,770
It has to be a favor,

1026
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:14,090
but prostitution's legal.
You guys are just confused.

1027
00:46:14,341 --> 00:46:16,770
We were confused.
Nation lost on the wrong side of the

1028
00:46:16,771 --> 00:46:17,481
planet.
Well,

1029
00:46:17,481 --> 00:46:22,020
you're a tiny land.
You know it's a giant chunk of ground as

1030
00:46:22,021 --> 00:46:24,990
big as the United States,
but a tiny group of people,

1031
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:27,120
a bunch of Los Angeles.
That's right.

1032
00:46:27,121 --> 00:46:30,810
We're the same population as well.
Bit bigger than greater Los Angeles.

1033
00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:34,830
You're not counting Mexicans.
They don't know skins are over here.

1034
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:39,690
They just don't.
They do and they do a census anyway.

1035
00:46:39,691 --> 00:46:44,180
Most people say,
most people say la is 18 or 19 million.

1036
00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:46,470
Australia is 24 but who's counting?
Listen,

1037
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:49,890
it's hop greater.
La is connected to Orange County is

1038
00:46:49,891 --> 00:46:54,420
connected to the inland empire is can.
It's not like it stops,

1039
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:56,300
you know like when you still chatting
Joe,

1040
00:46:56,310 --> 00:46:57,650
I'm with you.
Okay.

1041
00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:00,790
We agree about the lodge list of Los
Angeles County.

1042
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:03,120
Your country is not as big as ours.
I'm just saying,

1043
00:47:04,050 --> 00:47:06,090
but it's the same size.
The same size.

1044
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:06,641
Yeah.
If you,

1045
00:47:06,641 --> 00:47:10,430
if you exclude Alaska then it's the same
size as the United States.

1046
00:47:10,431 --> 00:47:12,720
You take ewas you know the United
States.

1047
00:47:12,721 --> 00:47:14,760
Exactly.
So it's got basically half the

1048
00:47:14,761 --> 00:47:16,470
population in California.
Yeah.

1049
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:20,130
You have a tiny little spot.
I know it's in terms of human beings,

1050
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:22,890
so we have some tiny,
where have you been to New Zealand yet?

1051
00:47:23,490 --> 00:47:24,600
No,
I heard it's awesome.

1052
00:47:24,601 --> 00:47:25,261
No,
it's great.

1053
00:47:25,261 --> 00:47:28,750
I mean that is a small place.
It's gorgeous.

1054
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:30,130
Beautiful.
I'm half

1055
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:31,430
New Zealand.
Yeah.

1056
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:35,260
How do you know like aren't on the same
shit he has basically.

1057
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:38,590
It's like so half Canadian California
saying they're from Nevada.

1058
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:41,440
Like do you even know?
Well it is a different country.

1059
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:44,140
Georgia.
That one right?

1060
00:47:44,141 --> 00:47:46,050
It's another island.
Yup.

1061
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:49,330
Go to fly over there.
You have a row to row 1200 miles.

1062
00:47:49,331 --> 00:47:50,890
Can you row 1200 miles?
Fuck yeah.

1063
00:47:50,891 --> 00:47:53,800
Polynesians can like that's true.
They can and did,

1064
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:55,660
they did.
So they got to Hawaii.

1065
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:58,960
Tanga used to control basically all of
the South Pacific.

1066
00:47:58,961 --> 00:47:59,560
They were,
they,

1067
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:02,800
they were absolutely bad.
Atses see the size of those fucking

1068
00:48:02,801 --> 00:48:03,321
people.
Yeah.

1069
00:48:03,321 --> 00:48:05,290
They big the giant.
They have giant bones.

1070
00:48:05,291 --> 00:48:06,670
They,
how do they fit in the canoe?

1071
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,150
They build big canoes,
Bro.

1072
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:11,860
Very big canoes and canoe full of toxins
can,

1073
00:48:11,861 --> 00:48:16,450
if I pull a pantry,
350 pound tongue is big humans,

1074
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:20,140
they probably really big back then too.
Even when people weren't as big,

1075
00:48:20,250 --> 00:48:21,083
they were probably bigger.

1076
00:48:21,610 --> 00:48:23,560
I think they've always been bigger.
Hello?

1077
00:48:23,561 --> 00:48:25,360
Americans are giving them a run for
their money right now.

1078
00:48:25,361 --> 00:48:27,370
And a stand I was,
he's starting to get fat.

1079
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:28,840
Well it's food,
foods,

1080
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:31,750
the high protein count.
I mean you've seen it in Japan as well.

1081
00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:33,460
You know,
people are just larger,

1082
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,460
you know,
they're eating more food and,

1083
00:48:35,530 --> 00:48:38,800
and we're eating more sugar that too.
Well there's also the,

1084
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:42,010
I had Gary Tobbs on who wrote that book
the case against sugar.

1085
00:48:42,011 --> 00:48:42,940
And one of the things that he was
saying,

1086
00:48:42,941 --> 00:48:46,690
it was really kind of interesting is
that when you feed people a higher sugar

1087
00:48:46,691 --> 00:48:49,540
diet,
the higher insulin count is actually

1088
00:48:49,541 --> 00:48:53,470
making larger people.
So he's talking about his kids and that

1089
00:48:53,471 --> 00:48:56,830
like you almost like wants to feed his
kids more sugar to make,

1090
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:57,970
you know,
bigger athletes.

1091
00:48:57,971 --> 00:48:59,320
And I'm like,
that's crazy.

1092
00:48:59,321 --> 00:49:01,570
So big or not in terms of having more
body fat,

1093
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,220
larger,
larger humans,

1094
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:05,140
larger human,
like taller as well.

1095
00:49:05,170 --> 00:49:06,310
Bigger.
Yeah,

1096
00:49:06,370 --> 00:49:08,200
just bigger people.
Yeah.

1097
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:12,220
There's some evidence that points to the
high sugar diet as well as the high

1098
00:49:12,221 --> 00:49:15,820
protein diet are contributing factors to
people being larger.

1099
00:49:15,850 --> 00:49:18,460
Could I just ate a lot of Donna's not
now.

1100
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:20,200
Not too long to miss the budge.
Yeah.

1101
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:23,020
How old would I had to be when I want to
be like a little kid?

1102
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:25,990
I think you have to be like,
I love you got to have a couple of twins

1103
00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:29,230
fish out a fuck or sugar stuff.
Their faces full of chocolate.

1104
00:49:29,231 --> 00:49:32,170
Best News I've heard all day.
You just kind of get like to the wall of

1105
00:49:32,171 --> 00:49:35,610
diabetes and pull back.
Oh,

1106
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,260
this'll be great,
by the way.

1107
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:40,150
Always want to get real clear.
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking

1108
00:49:40,151 --> 00:49:42,360
about,
so don't go feed your kids down at,

1109
00:49:42,670 --> 00:49:45,130
and I don't even remember exactly what
Gary Topp said.

1110
00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:47,580
Jamie's Colin's a liability of being Joe
Rogan story.

1111
00:49:47,590 --> 00:49:49,660
The other day I showed you.
This is after the show.

1112
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:52,390
Let's get [inaudible] spilling onto
Wisconsin highway.

1113
00:49:52,391 --> 00:49:53,770
We're headed for cattle feed.
Oh yeah,

1114
00:49:53,771 --> 00:49:55,900
they do do that.
They give it the cows candy.

1115
00:49:55,990 --> 00:49:57,330
Yeah.
That's just to fatten them up the

1116
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:58,193
cheaper.
Yeah,

1117
00:49:58,210 --> 00:49:58,991
yeah,
yeah.

1118
00:49:58,991 --> 00:50:01,420
They do do that.
They feed cows candy to make them

1119
00:50:01,421 --> 00:50:02,920
fatter.
They've done,

1120
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:06,190
they also feed them antibiotics just to,
just to make them bigger,

1121
00:50:06,191 --> 00:50:08,680
just to make them grow faster.
Oh actually the reason why they feed

1122
00:50:08,681 --> 00:50:12,170
them antibiotics is their bodies reject
the grain there,

1123
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:15,490
feed them corn and things like that and
they develop abscesses and their books

1124
00:50:15,491 --> 00:50:18,190
to affections to fall.
Apparently it's for that reason.

1125
00:50:18,191 --> 00:50:21,400
And also it just has this side,
the byproducts that it makes them grow

1126
00:50:21,401 --> 00:50:22,780
faster.
Antibiotics,

1127
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:23,850
antibiotics.
Yup.

1128
00:50:24,050 --> 00:50:24,883
Oh weird.
Yeah.

1129
00:50:24,930 --> 00:50:27,620
It's bizarre.
I don't try to take those things

1130
00:50:27,621 --> 00:50:28,250
anymore.

1131
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:31,620
I know was I really need them.
Surgery when you get surgery should take

1132
00:50:31,621 --> 00:50:31,941
it.
Yeah,

1133
00:50:31,941 --> 00:50:33,950
that's right.
But you should be real careful about

1134
00:50:33,951 --> 00:50:36,920
taking them for like little colds.
I think I'm just going to take a z pack.

1135
00:50:36,990 --> 00:50:37,490
Yup.
Yeah.

1136
00:50:37,490 --> 00:50:38,990
You're going to make a super virus.
You fuck.

1137
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:40,310
That's right.
And if you do,

1138
00:50:40,311 --> 00:50:42,170
then make sure that you take probiotics
and shit.

1139
00:50:42,171 --> 00:50:44,120
Eat a lot of Kimchi and sauerkraut and
all that stuff.

1140
00:50:44,121 --> 00:50:45,350
Here you go buddy.
Yeah,

1141
00:50:45,470 --> 00:50:47,330
I know.
I've been listening to Joe Rogan.

1142
00:50:47,370 --> 00:50:49,650
You know where I got that?
That inflammation problems.

1143
00:50:50,210 --> 00:50:50,931
Yeah,
exactly.

1144
00:50:50,931 --> 00:50:51,560
That's right.
She's,

1145
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:53,870
she's good value isn't she?
She's a genius.

1146
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:55,160
Yeah.
Um,

1147
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:56,960
she's making a person,
I wonder if she's going to feed it

1148
00:50:56,961 --> 00:50:58,490
sugar.
How old?

1149
00:50:58,530 --> 00:50:59,690
How long?
How far along was it?

1150
00:50:59,691 --> 00:51:00,980
Third Person.
Third Trimester.

1151
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:01,873
Okay.
Yeah.

1152
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,270
I needed to learn all that shit.
I'm not good with like the numbers of

1153
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:06,350
human physiology.

1154
00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:08,710
I didn't know what a trimester was.
It's difficult.

1155
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:12,260
You're a guy cause I don't have a slide.
I don't have cycles.

1156
00:51:12,261 --> 00:51:15,470
I don't have the cycles of the men
steroid administration and the moon and

1157
00:51:15,470 --> 00:51:17,360
the tide comes in and the tide goes out
and the blood comes in,

1158
00:51:17,361 --> 00:51:19,760
into the band comes out.
It's impossible to explain and the baby

1159
00:51:19,761 --> 00:51:20,720
comes out.
Sweet baby.

1160
00:51:20,721 --> 00:51:22,790
Jesus is the only explanation.
Joe.

1161
00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:26,120
So explain to me what the law is right
now in Australia.

1162
00:51:26,121 --> 00:51:28,700
Like,
can you hire a surrogate or is it being

1163
00:51:28,701 --> 00:51:30,890
pushed back?
Well that's a state by state thing cause

1164
00:51:30,891 --> 00:51:33,200
the strategy of results.
So a federation like the United States,

1165
00:51:33,201 --> 00:51:34,850
which he used to be a bunch of separate
colonies.

1166
00:51:34,851 --> 00:51:36,050
So it used to be a bunch of,
you know,

1167
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:39,410
penal colonies that Britain basically
after the American revolution,

1168
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,990
Britain had no where to send its
criminals.

1169
00:51:41,991 --> 00:51:45,110
And it was a very,
very tough law and order states in the

1170
00:51:45,111 --> 00:51:47,030
17 hundreds in the UK.

1171
00:51:47,030 --> 00:51:49,760
Like if you,
it was three strikes and you're out.

1172
00:51:49,761 --> 00:51:52,340
That wasn't even in the start of it.
And it was incredible inequality.

1173
00:51:52,341 --> 00:51:55,880
There was no welfare obviously and no
food stamps and shit like that.

1174
00:51:55,881 --> 00:52:00,881
So people who were starving would steal
a loaf of bread and you do that twice

1175
00:52:01,431 --> 00:52:02,270
and they'd be like,
all right,

1176
00:52:02,271 --> 00:52:04,850
we're going to send you to the moon,
which is essentially a strategy.

1177
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:06,200
Right?
So they went and found,

1178
00:52:06,201 --> 00:52:10,160
they discovered this great southern land
that had been rumored about and had been

1179
00:52:10,161 --> 00:52:14,210
kind of sketched on the edges by some of
the explorers from the Netherlands and

1180
00:52:14,211 --> 00:52:18,290
from France so far.
And they sent out captain cook to settle

1181
00:52:18,291 --> 00:52:21,200
it basically.
So they would have a place for creative

1182
00:52:21,201 --> 00:52:26,150
criminals to examine a huge,
vast sunburnt land for criminals to to

1183
00:52:26,151 --> 00:52:28,600
run free.
And now that they could no longer use

1184
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,170
United States any of those colonies.

1185
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:34,280
It's one of the most beautiful places in
the world and some of the nicest people

1186
00:52:34,281 --> 00:52:35,750
in the world lived there like they
fucked up.

1187
00:52:35,751 --> 00:52:39,480
They made it a better place than ain't
sent the criminals and the criminals.

1188
00:52:39,510 --> 00:52:40,610
Like,
you know what our problem was?

1189
00:52:40,611 --> 00:52:42,620
We were living in fucking England.
It never,

1190
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:46,610
it's never sunny.
People are constantly bars or a thousand

1191
00:52:46,610 --> 00:52:47,930
years old.
Jesus Christ,

1192
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:50,000
I feel so good.
I'm going to be a criminal anymore.

1193
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:53,600
I'm going to go south and Oh,
oh please judge.

1194
00:52:53,601 --> 00:52:56,720
Don't send me to the other side of the
world to a tropical paradise when I

1195
00:52:56,721 --> 00:52:59,780
could be living here in London where
it's dirty and disease written and it's

1196
00:52:59,781 --> 00:53:02,970
rainy and drizzly and gray all the time.
But isn't it of bid?

1197
00:53:03,070 --> 00:53:05,270
How there's a balance to everything.
Cause when you go to Australia,

1198
00:53:05,271 --> 00:53:07,130
everything can fucking kill you.
Yeah,

1199
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:08,930
that's true.
Part of the problem is,

1200
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:10,450
but goddamn box,
jelly,

1201
00:53:10,451 --> 00:53:13,610
fish,
Brown spiders and Brown snakes and all

1202
00:53:13,611 --> 00:53:14,270
these different things.

1203
00:53:14,270 --> 00:53:17,480
It can fuck you up,
but you don't feel afraid of that when

1204
00:53:17,481 --> 00:53:20,060
you're in Australia.
Do you you get over that and 24 hours?

1205
00:53:20,090 --> 00:53:20,691
No,
not me.

1206
00:53:20,691 --> 00:53:23,840
I'm a POC.
Terrified of bugs and snakes and shit.

1207
00:53:24,050 --> 00:53:26,580
Cause I'm the,
I mean you do to typically that you're

1208
00:53:26,581 --> 00:53:30,270
much more likely to be killed in it on
the freeway here in la or by someone

1209
00:53:30,271 --> 00:53:32,550
shooting you in the states than you are
by appspider.

1210
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:35,910
Biden say bless you.
Go near the spiders and the snakes,

1211
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:39,090
which is what I would do.
Let me know the problem with me,

1212
00:53:39,091 --> 00:53:41,250
I don't approach them.
We'll have a buddy of mine,

1213
00:53:41,251 --> 00:53:43,500
my friend Adam Green tree was a big bow
hunter in Australia.

1214
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:44,970
Yep.
So He's trying to get me to go hang out

1215
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:46,780
with them and I'm always like,
hey,

1216
00:53:46,781 --> 00:53:47,151
yeah,
yeah,

1217
00:53:47,151 --> 00:53:47,970
yeah,
I'll do that.

1218
00:53:47,970 --> 00:53:51,960
And then they send me a picture of some
fucking spider that a vicious poisonous

1219
00:53:51,961 --> 00:53:54,030
spider eating a vicious poisonous snake.

1220
00:53:54,670 --> 00:53:56,430
The fuck do you live,
man,

1221
00:53:56,730 --> 00:53:59,280
this is insane.
Crocodiles everywhere.

1222
00:53:59,490 --> 00:54:02,880
They went hunting and they didn't bring
any water and they just figured they

1223
00:54:02,881 --> 00:54:06,540
would find water and they use water
purification systems and cleaned it out.

1224
00:54:06,541 --> 00:54:09,810
So they're drinking buffalo piss water
cause he's water buffaloes.

1225
00:54:09,811 --> 00:54:13,830
They piss in this water and then you
have these filter pumps and you pump out

1226
00:54:13,831 --> 00:54:17,010
all the toxins but it still tastes like
piss because you're essentially drinking

1227
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:21,990
purified pests and um,
they were cooling off in this water and

1228
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:23,880
they,
they didn't realize that there's

1229
00:54:23,881 --> 00:54:25,190
crocodiles in the area,
Shit.

1230
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:28,830
So they easily could've got checked by a
crocodile crocodile slide into that

1231
00:54:28,831 --> 00:54:31,140
water and they just sit and wait.
But it's one of those things that you

1232
00:54:31,141 --> 00:54:32,910
just led about as a kid.
It's a bit like,

1233
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:35,340
I mean people like,
it's like when you talk to Canadians

1234
00:54:35,341 --> 00:54:38,460
about the risk of bears and they just
sort of laugh it off because you learn

1235
00:54:38,461 --> 00:54:40,770
about how,
or like people from Finland about

1236
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:42,780
falling through the ice on a frozen
lake.

1237
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:44,970
These are just things that you learn
about when you're a kid and you just

1238
00:54:44,971 --> 00:54:47,370
take it for granted.
I know where they will be.

1239
00:54:47,371 --> 00:54:51,930
Crocodiles 99% of the time and I don't
go to those places and I certainly

1240
00:54:51,931 --> 00:54:53,310
don't.
Well sure,

1241
00:54:53,370 --> 00:54:54,210
yeah,
exactly.

1242
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:58,410
Get ready.
Farmer will be be with a group of

1243
00:54:58,411 --> 00:54:59,910
people.
I mean in terms of the,

1244
00:54:59,911 --> 00:55:02,700
in terms of like how good it was for
convicts.

1245
00:55:02,701 --> 00:55:04,890
I mean people came out to Australia for
um,

1246
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:08,010
you know,
Brits came out to Australia even if they

1247
00:55:08,011 --> 00:55:09,930
weren't criminals just because they
wanted a new,

1248
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:12,180
like a new adventure.
I mean,

1249
00:55:12,181 --> 00:55:14,400
my,
and some of the states of Australia

1250
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:17,520
actually we're free settler colonies
like South Australia,

1251
00:55:17,521 --> 00:55:19,680
which is one of the states was never a
convict,

1252
00:55:19,710 --> 00:55:22,020
a penal colony.
And in fact,

1253
00:55:22,021 --> 00:55:26,160
when Australia became a country in 1901,
they w in the constitutional conventions

1254
00:55:26,161 --> 00:55:27,360
in the eighties and nineties,
which,

1255
00:55:27,361 --> 00:55:30,750
which created a country out of all of
these previously separate colonies,

1256
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:34,080
New Zealand within negotiations to be
part of that country as well.

1257
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:36,150
And Western Australia,
which is the western half of the

1258
00:55:36,151 --> 00:55:37,890
continent was going to be a separate
country.

1259
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:41,370
And the eastern half,
the eastern states of Australia and New

1260
00:55:41,370 --> 00:55:43,590
Zealand could have been a single
country.

1261
00:55:43,591 --> 00:55:45,900
And then at the last minute and New
Zealand jumped out in Western Australia,

1262
00:55:45,901 --> 00:55:48,930
jumped in and now you've got two
different countries.

1263
00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:51,690
But Anyway,
oh this massive huntsman spider in

1264
00:55:51,691 --> 00:55:52,740
Australia is what?
Yeah,

1265
00:55:52,741 --> 00:55:54,420
but huntsman's aren't,
they don't hurt you.

1266
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:55,760
It gives a fuck.
Kill Them.

1267
00:55:56,210 --> 00:55:58,750
When you get those,
you get those spiders,

1268
00:56:00,090 --> 00:56:04,170
spiders inside even in Sydney,
but then on size harmful God damn giant

1269
00:56:04,171 --> 00:56:05,910
crab.
That's huge.

1270
00:56:05,911 --> 00:56:07,100
It's on a broom.
So it's not,

1271
00:56:07,101 --> 00:56:09,930
you can tell that it's big enough to
scare the fuck out of you.

1272
00:56:09,931 --> 00:56:11,460
If it was in your underwear,
you die.

1273
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:16,670
Yeah.
You know New Zealand is a place that's

1274
00:56:16,891 --> 00:56:21,270
really fascinating because they brought
over all these wild game animals from

1275
00:56:21,271 --> 00:56:24,040
other countries to turn it into a
paradise.

1276
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:27,850
And I think they did in the 17 hundreds
of the 1800 it would have been insane.

1277
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:30,610
Hundreds cause I think it was only
settled by white people in the 17

1278
00:56:30,611 --> 00:56:33,730
hundreds yeah.
And now they're the run rampant around

1279
00:56:33,731 --> 00:56:38,170
the island cause there's no predators.
So they have these hordes of red stags

1280
00:56:38,171 --> 00:56:40,910
from Europe.
They're wandering around New Zealand.

1281
00:56:41,650 --> 00:56:44,620
We spoke last time about the,
about the attempt that New Zealand is

1282
00:56:44,621 --> 00:56:47,380
doing to basically eradicate all of its
predators,

1283
00:56:47,381 --> 00:56:50,680
all of its invasive predators who that
have come from abroad like New Zealand

1284
00:56:50,710 --> 00:56:55,350
because it was the last country to be
settled by white people by White Farnaz

1285
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:57,010
that is who brought,
you know,

1286
00:56:57,011 --> 00:56:59,680
foxes and rabbits and whatever nasty
things.

1287
00:56:59,681 --> 00:57:02,080
I always forget exactly what called cats
too.

1288
00:57:02,590 --> 00:57:05,020
I can't even remember what,
every time I say this publicly,

1289
00:57:05,021 --> 00:57:06,340
someone from New Zealand,
he was like,

1290
00:57:06,370 --> 00:57:08,680
actually we don't have Fox News on
twitter,

1291
00:57:08,710 --> 00:57:11,860
so I definitely do in Australia caddy
and have the same issue.

1292
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:13,780
You have the same issue in Australia.
Totally,

1293
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:15,610
totally.
But in Australia it's too far gone.

1294
00:57:15,611 --> 00:57:17,740
There's no way that you would be able to
actually eradicate them.

1295
00:57:17,741 --> 00:57:19,450
Whereas in New Zealand there is like it
is,

1296
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:23,860
it is a New Zealand,
his patriotic duty to murder as many

1297
00:57:23,950 --> 00:57:28,120
little mammals as they can because those
little mammals eat the night of birds

1298
00:57:28,121 --> 00:57:29,800
and eat all the native wildlife and
stuff.

1299
00:57:29,801 --> 00:57:31,660
So New Zealand is like my cousins over
there.

1300
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:35,450
They set traps out in their yard and
every morning they go down like they

1301
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:38,890
with bloodied hands pulling out the
caucus is of animals that they've killed

1302
00:57:39,070 --> 00:57:39,731
and they're like,
oh yeah,

1303
00:57:39,731 --> 00:57:41,230
this good job.
Good for you.

1304
00:57:41,410 --> 00:57:46,410
Well Australia a bit bow hunting
magazines show people holding cats up

1305
00:57:46,590 --> 00:57:50,200
like domestic cat.
I hold them and you gotta like an Arrow

1306
00:57:50,201 --> 00:57:53,200
through the heart.
And there was a guy recently who got

1307
00:57:53,201 --> 00:57:57,130
attacked on instagram because he's an
Australian bow hunter and he's out bow

1308
00:57:57,131 --> 00:57:59,680
hunting and he killed this cat and all
these people were freaking out.

1309
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:01,540
That was some of these pat you piece of
shit.

1310
00:58:01,541 --> 00:58:04,760
And they're like,
actually you don't understand this is

1311
00:58:04,810 --> 00:58:09,040
the ruining the ground nesting birds,
all these different animals that live in

1312
00:58:09,041 --> 00:58:11,050
the ground,
that mean to the animals that have never

1313
00:58:11,051 --> 00:58:13,660
had a Predator to like that and they're
missed or do just getting destroyed.

1314
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:16,000
They're a menace that as cats they get
out.

1315
00:58:16,310 --> 00:58:17,320
Yeah,
it's hopeless

1316
00:58:19,150 --> 00:58:21,700
on the question of,
isn't that beautiful,

1317
00:58:21,701 --> 00:58:24,160
nice shirt.
Reagan nose blow right there and you've

1318
00:58:24,161 --> 00:58:25,270
got a cold or is it just,
uh,

1319
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:27,170
I left someone off fighting,
went off.

1320
00:58:27,370 --> 00:58:29,760
Don't take antibiotics and you can say,
I'm,

1321
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:32,590
I'm almost out of it.
But I worked out today pretty hard.

1322
00:58:32,950 --> 00:58:34,270
Some fucking crazy,
bro.

1323
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:36,130
What'd you do?
Lifting weights.

1324
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:37,720
Kettle kettlebells.
You know,

1325
00:58:37,721 --> 00:58:38,554
I do.

1326
00:58:41,070 --> 00:58:43,060
Um,
what was I gonna say about Australian

1327
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:44,410
animals too?
I forgot.

1328
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:45,970
Uh,
it's,

1329
00:58:45,971 --> 00:58:46,900
uh,
it's,

1330
00:58:46,901 --> 00:58:49,480
it's,
it's amazing that there is imbalanced.

1331
00:58:49,510 --> 00:58:50,710
Oh,
that's what it was.

1332
00:58:51,030 --> 00:58:52,780
The,
you're a Tasmanian tiger,

1333
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:55,620
which was an animal that was extinct.
Yeah.

1334
00:58:55,630 --> 00:58:59,230
Apparently there's a bunch of sightings
this thing and they're pretty sure that

1335
00:58:59,231 --> 00:59:01,450
it might actually still be alive.
I've read that.

1336
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:02,840
I hope so.
It'd be,

1337
00:59:02,910 --> 00:59:04,780
there's,
there's this really depressing footage.

1338
00:59:04,781 --> 00:59:06,250
You can say it online of the,
uh,

1339
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:08,470
of the,
the last day of a Tasmanian tiger eye in

1340
00:59:08,471 --> 00:59:09,390
a zoo,
uh,

1341
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:11,470
just pacing back and forth and back and
forth,

1342
00:59:11,510 --> 00:59:13,540
wiped it out completely.
1930s.

1343
00:59:13,541 --> 00:59:14,670
Right,
exactly.

1344
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:16,120
Footage it really early.
I mean,

1345
00:59:16,121 --> 00:59:18,130
they basically destroyed everything in
Tasmania.

1346
00:59:18,131 --> 00:59:20,240
They wiped out the,
the night of aboriginal through and

1347
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:21,650
wiped out the paypal.
They wiped out.

1348
00:59:21,710 --> 00:59:22,520
I mean,
it was like,

1349
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:23,640
you know,
Haley,

1350
00:59:23,710 --> 00:59:24,980
oh,
the British empire.

1351
00:59:25,010 --> 00:59:28,270
Let's make things better by killing.
Everything is interesting.

1352
00:59:28,540 --> 00:59:31,460
Do you guys change the British accent?
Just a little.

1353
00:59:31,910 --> 00:59:34,820
Whereas like most Americans can't tell
where the fuck you're from.

1354
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:36,680
How do you not tell?
Honestly,

1355
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:38,450
it's really,
it's the same thing.

1356
00:59:38,451 --> 00:59:41,150
It's obviously not in the,
it's been half up.

1357
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:43,790
You're not from here.
I can tell the difference between

1358
00:59:43,791 --> 00:59:46,250
Canadian and American.
Well that's easy.

1359
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:48,380
Done easy.
Cause you were American as soon as you

1360
00:59:48,381 --> 00:59:49,700
hear a boat.
Exactly.

1361
00:59:49,850 --> 00:59:52,700
But then they're nicer.
I mean actually that is less different

1362
00:59:52,701 --> 00:59:54,500
than the difference between British and
Australian.

1363
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:57,620
Consider a place.
Can you tell us what's going on in New

1364
00:59:57,620 --> 01:00:00,890
Zealand and Arizona accent and a
California accent?

1365
01:00:01,810 --> 01:00:04,310
Don't know.
Neither one have one.

1366
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:05,593
It was a trick question.

1367
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:10,580
Come on with an Arizona accident.
What the fuck is in Arizona accent?

1368
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:12,020
Yeah.
Now the only American accent so that I

1369
01:00:12,021 --> 01:00:14,060
can easily pick apart from the big city
ones.

1370
01:00:14,061 --> 01:00:16,670
Cause you can tell Boston,
you can tell in New York he can,

1371
01:00:16,730 --> 01:00:18,010
uh,
that's a bet.

1372
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:22,720
That's basically it is the south.
See there's that midwestern thing where

1373
01:00:22,730 --> 01:00:26,000
like Minnesota and Wisconsin and have
that all that cane,

1374
01:00:26,010 --> 01:00:28,890
da Fargo,
that sort of Fargo.

1375
01:00:28,891 --> 01:00:30,170
We accent.
Uh,

1376
01:00:30,190 --> 01:00:31,160
and then you've got the,
yeah,

1377
01:00:31,161 --> 01:00:34,820
the west coast thing and then the,
but that Fargo thing is similar to

1378
01:00:34,821 --> 01:00:36,110
Canadian as well.
A little bit.

1379
01:00:36,111 --> 01:00:38,510
It gets a little bit confusing sometimes
when you're a foreigner,

1380
01:00:38,511 --> 01:00:40,490
like myself.
Friendly people that live in the cold.

1381
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:42,830
That's right.
Yes.

1382
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:45,650
They have to be like helping each other
out.

1383
01:00:45,770 --> 01:00:47,390
Sense of community.
Canadians.

1384
01:00:47,391 --> 01:00:48,790
It's sort of like aussies,
you know,

1385
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:50,360
they were also big landmass.

1386
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:52,880
Not very many people.
Mostly in hospital.

1387
01:00:53,270 --> 01:00:56,580
Most of them are huddled along one
stretch of land in,

1388
01:00:56,780 --> 01:00:58,520
in Canada it's the,
it's the border.

1389
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:00,490
And in Australia it's the coastline.
Yeah.

1390
01:01:00,610 --> 01:01:02,870
I think they have less people than
California as well.

1391
01:01:03,230 --> 01:01:04,580
Yeah,
they have about the same I think.

1392
01:01:04,581 --> 01:01:05,930
I think they have a bit more than
Australia.

1393
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:08,000
I feel like 50 million or something.
Yeah,

1394
01:01:08,090 --> 01:01:09,590
exactly.
Um,

1395
01:01:09,620 --> 01:01:11,390
I'd moved there.
Those are the two places I'd moved.

1396
01:01:11,391 --> 01:01:12,770
By the way,
if I didn't live in America,

1397
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:16,250
like if some shit hit the fan here,
if California,

1398
01:01:16,890 --> 01:01:19,010
California slid into the ocean and the
big earthquake or something,

1399
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:21,290
um,
I would either live in Canada or

1400
01:01:21,291 --> 01:01:22,540
Australia.
Those are two spots.

1401
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:24,770
Hold Joe.
Are you aware of that?

1402
01:01:24,820 --> 01:01:27,500
To be cold on Vancouver?
No,

1403
01:01:27,501 --> 01:01:31,040
but it's rainy and cloudy and gray.
Beautiful Green on the three days a

1404
01:01:31,041 --> 01:01:32,600
week.
When it's a year,

1405
01:01:32,601 --> 01:01:34,190
when it's sunny,
it's beautiful.

1406
01:01:34,250 --> 01:01:36,830
People are cool as fuck.
362 days a year.

1407
01:01:37,550 --> 01:01:39,770
Horrible.
Don't be a pussy.

1408
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:43,580
Chrisley so what?
Stay inside good strip down gets me

1409
01:01:43,581 --> 01:01:47,070
down.
Mr [inaudible] tell you when it is

1410
01:01:48,710 --> 01:01:51,410
something
I guess.

1411
01:01:51,411 --> 01:01:55,070
I guess I get seasonal affective
disorder because my sister in law is

1412
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:58,370
from Finland and when I go to Finland
and it's gray and doc,

1413
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:01,910
I don't feel good.
You get sad.

1414
01:02:02,210 --> 01:02:05,790
I get sad,
I get sad and I actually,

1415
01:02:05,791 --> 01:02:08,960
I don't mind the cold called and I'm
under really frigid freezing.

1416
01:02:08,961 --> 01:02:12,350
Karl lived in New York for 10 ish years,
depending on how you count it and the

1417
01:02:12,410 --> 01:02:16,130
and the winters out there when it's
crisp and bright and blue sky.

1418
01:02:16,131 --> 01:02:19,320
I mean you grew up in the north face.
You know what that's like when it's a

1419
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:20,880
nice day.
I don't actually care if it's only five

1420
01:02:20,881 --> 01:02:22,590
degrees Fahrenheit,
if it's,

1421
01:02:22,950 --> 01:02:24,180
if it's like sunny.

1422
01:02:24,450 --> 01:02:27,180
Right.
But I don't like gloom New York and

1423
01:02:27,181 --> 01:02:29,670
Boston in particular.
It gets really gloomy in the winter.

1424
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:33,030
I definitely think that affects people.
I definitely used to affect me,

1425
01:02:33,330 --> 01:02:35,880
but um,
it's not as bad.

1426
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:41,180
Like Colorado gets super fucking cold,
but it's really sunny and Colorado

1427
01:02:41,401 --> 01:02:43,170
doesn't have any of that shit.
It's not,

1428
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:46,730
I agree with you.
It's not necessarily the cold as much as

1429
01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:49,680
it is the lack of Sun.
We need clear scars.

1430
01:02:49,681 --> 01:02:51,000
That's Ryan's feel better.
Yeah.

1431
01:02:51,001 --> 01:02:53,710
That's what I don't like about London
and Amsterdam and said he's like that as

1432
01:02:53,730 --> 01:02:54,780
well.
Seattle,

1433
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:57,000
Portland,
Portland Tomorrow Holla,

1434
01:02:57,030 --> 01:02:58,350
two shows.
Oh Great.

1435
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:00,690
Nice city.
But again,

1436
01:03:01,230 --> 01:03:02,640
fuck you.
Portland's awesome.

1437
01:03:03,150 --> 01:03:06,800
How many days of the year does it rain?
289 days of sunshine in Vancouver.

1438
01:03:06,850 --> 01:03:07,950
That's what he's a pussy.
Shit.

1439
01:03:07,951 --> 01:03:10,110
What is Jamie?
What are you looking up here?

1440
01:03:10,550 --> 01:03:13,860
They comp results.
It does say there's 166 days with

1441
01:03:13,861 --> 01:03:16,480
measurable precipitations that does a
bat up at the top.

1442
01:03:16,490 --> 01:03:18,960
It does because we're rains part of the
day,

1443
01:03:19,050 --> 01:03:22,500
but hang on 299 days of sunshine.
That just might mean that at some point

1444
01:03:22,501 --> 01:03:25,020
during the day there was a bit of a
glimmer of some,

1445
01:03:25,021 --> 01:03:25,854
that's all I need bro.

1446
01:03:28,470 --> 01:03:32,700
Just set up a little alarm to go.
I know we're still on a planet.

1447
01:03:32,730 --> 01:03:34,800
I knew there's,
or a bubbles.

1448
01:03:35,150 --> 01:03:35,983
Good.
Uh,

1449
01:03:36,090 --> 01:03:39,000
have you seen about um,
about the election in the cool,

1450
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:41,070
quite a few stories coming out of Europe
this week.

1451
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:44,250
I did a story I did my podcast today
about,

1452
01:03:44,490 --> 01:03:47,820
there's the British prime minister just
called a snap election.

1453
01:03:49,110 --> 01:03:53,460
Try to reaffirm her mandate for brexit.
And the French had gone to the polls

1454
01:03:53,461 --> 01:03:56,400
next week and for the first round of the
presidential election,

1455
01:03:56,401 --> 01:04:01,401
which could see the far right leader,
Marine Le Pen Win in France.

1456
01:04:01,591 --> 01:04:04,050
And if she does,
she wants to crash out of the euro

1457
01:04:04,051 --> 01:04:05,020
currency,
you know,

1458
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:08,670
break,
do frexit brexit crush any France leaves

1459
01:04:08,671 --> 01:04:10,200
the EU.
Then that actually is all live.

1460
01:04:10,201 --> 01:04:12,360
I like penetration can leave if that
happens.

1461
01:04:12,361 --> 01:04:16,890
When would France leave the EU?
I saw that there's massive antifascist

1462
01:04:16,891 --> 01:04:17,820
protest this week.

1463
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:20,640
Yeah.
So the way that their electoral system

1464
01:04:20,641 --> 01:04:22,860
works is they,
instead of doing it all on one day,

1465
01:04:22,861 --> 01:04:26,460
they basically,
whoever can run and get on the ballot,

1466
01:04:26,630 --> 01:04:28,380
they,
there's like maybe eight to 12

1467
01:04:28,381 --> 01:04:30,360
candidates who are on the ballot next
week.

1468
01:04:30,390 --> 01:04:32,850
And then assuming that one person
doesn't get one of them,

1469
01:04:32,851 --> 01:04:35,400
doesn't get more than 50% of the vote,
which I almost never do.

1470
01:04:35,730 --> 01:04:37,770
That then goes to a second round of
Palette,

1471
01:04:37,830 --> 01:04:39,930
which is next month.
And that's the actual presidential

1472
01:04:39,931 --> 01:04:42,300
election between the two main
candidates.

1473
01:04:42,330 --> 01:04:47,330
And what it looks like is that the far
right leader who is softer than her dad

1474
01:04:47,851 --> 01:04:51,870
who founded the far right party was,
but he was like a Holocaust denier and

1475
01:04:51,871 --> 01:04:54,220
like serious antisemites and she's just
a,

1476
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:59,320
an anti Muslim like anti-immigration
Nteu sort of like more right wing

1477
01:05:00,151 --> 01:05:02,040
version of trump.
Uh,

1478
01:05:02,070 --> 01:05:04,320
she will get through in next week's
election,

1479
01:05:04,321 --> 01:05:05,760
which means that she's going to wane
her,

1480
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:09,240
I don't know,
the polls say she wasn't,

1481
01:05:09,241 --> 01:05:11,730
but the polls didn't say that brexit was
going to happen or that Donald Trump was

1482
01:05:11,731 --> 01:05:13,470
gonna win either.
So the question is,

1483
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:16,080
will people stay at home?
Because the person who she's most likely

1484
01:05:16,081 --> 01:05:18,070
to be running against is just this kind

1485
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:20,110
of slick,
nice,

1486
01:05:20,260 --> 01:05:22,300
handsome,
doesn't really believe in anything.

1487
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:25,300
Not really a politician,
but kind of pragmatic.

1488
01:05:25,301 --> 01:05:27,100
I mean maybe that'll work,
I don't know,

1489
01:05:27,101 --> 01:05:31,520
but it's a bit of a worry if you care
about the stability of Europe and like

1490
01:05:31,870 --> 01:05:35,560
Germany and France not ever being in a
war again for them not to be knitted

1491
01:05:35,561 --> 01:05:38,710
together and into the European Union.
I do worry about it.

1492
01:05:38,711 --> 01:05:40,540
And then there was the Turkey thing that
we were talking about,

1493
01:05:40,541 --> 01:05:43,180
so we've got these three,
these kinds of pieces of jigsaw puzzle

1494
01:05:43,181 --> 01:05:46,070
that had been bashing around in my head
over the past few days about like,

1495
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:51,780
will we look back on this period as just
a starting point to something even

1496
01:05:52,871 --> 01:05:55,390
bigger?
Like I already think that it's amazing

1497
01:05:56,020 --> 01:05:58,960
like that trump is amazing.
Like I mean if two years ago I was on,

1498
01:05:58,990 --> 01:06:02,280
when was I first on this show?
Maybe three years ago or something like

1499
01:06:02,290 --> 01:06:03,123
that.

1500
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:05,980
You know,
if someone had walked in that door and

1501
01:06:05,981 --> 01:06:08,080
said to us,
okay,

1502
01:06:08,290 --> 01:06:11,530
in 2017 you are going to be back on the
show,

1503
01:06:11,531 --> 01:06:12,760
are you going to be talking to each
other?

1504
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:18,300
And the FBI will be conducting an active
investigation into whether or not the

1505
01:06:20,111 --> 01:06:25,111
government of the day conspired with
Putin in Russia to spread misinformation

1506
01:06:28,001 --> 01:06:33,001
and illegally hack the emails of the
Democratic Party on,

1507
01:06:33,101 --> 01:06:35,920
by the way,
the president is Donald Trump

1508
01:06:37,470 --> 01:06:39,910
and we know that the hacking happened.
We know that the Russians hacked,

1509
01:06:39,911 --> 01:06:41,890
did hack this and did spread
misinformation.

1510
01:06:41,891 --> 01:06:44,740
But the only question is whether the FBI
is trying to figure out whether or not

1511
01:06:44,741 --> 01:06:47,050
there was active collaboration with the
government.

1512
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:50,620
What do you think about that?
I mean we would be like,

1513
01:06:50,710 --> 01:06:53,560
that's a cartoon.
That's a fucking cartoon story.

1514
01:06:53,561 --> 01:06:58,561
That is cray crazy cloud cuckoo land.
And so that's where my head has been at.

1515
01:06:59,250 --> 01:07:01,860
But that would have been,
if we did have that conversation,

1516
01:07:01,861 --> 01:07:05,010
that would have been before the
nightclub shooting in Paris that have

1517
01:07:05,011 --> 01:07:07,800
been before the truck ran over those
people in Nice.

1518
01:07:07,830 --> 01:07:08,940
Yup.
Like the,

1519
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:14,000
those are those terrorist attacks that
they have had over in France and in

1520
01:07:14,041 --> 01:07:18,150
Germany have scared the fucking shit out
of people and letting all those people

1521
01:07:18,151 --> 01:07:22,710
in from Syria with no vetting and
letting a lot of Muslims coming to the

1522
01:07:22,711 --> 01:07:27,210
country that may have some real hate in
their heart for this new land that

1523
01:07:27,211 --> 01:07:30,040
they've found.
I mean they've got some real issues and

1524
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:34,250
that's when a person who's a fascist who
comes along who's like this anti

1525
01:07:34,251 --> 01:07:35,820
immigration,
you know,

1526
01:07:35,821 --> 01:07:38,730
comes from a racist background,
super right wing.

1527
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:40,640
That's when those people take hold.
Well this is

1528
01:07:40,670 --> 01:07:41,870
what I always say.
I'm actually,

1529
01:07:41,871 --> 01:07:45,770
I'm talking to Sam Harris tomorrow on my
podcast and this is something that he

1530
01:07:45,771 --> 01:07:49,850
and I talk about a lot,
which is we have to find a new way to

1531
01:07:49,851 --> 01:07:53,780
converse about the problem of,
of Islamic jihadism without being so

1532
01:07:53,781 --> 01:07:54,950
full of shit.
If we,

1533
01:07:54,951 --> 01:07:56,750
if you are,
if you are a globalist and an

1534
01:07:56,751 --> 01:07:59,020
international list like I am,
if you basically believe

1535
01:07:59,250 --> 01:08:01,020
you're a globalist,
that's a negative thing.

1536
01:08:01,170 --> 01:08:05,100
I know I've only started using that term
lately because the old Wright thinks

1537
01:08:05,101 --> 01:08:07,250
that globalism is like this Jewish,
you know,

1538
01:08:07,390 --> 01:08:10,080
global conspiracy and I love,
I'm trying to take over the world.

1539
01:08:10,110 --> 01:08:12,930
I'm open.
I'm an open minded person so I think

1540
01:08:13,110 --> 01:08:16,640
what I would define it,
well I would it as being someone who

1541
01:08:16,641 --> 01:08:20,960
doesn't like borders and who doesn't
like nationalism and jingoism and

1542
01:08:20,990 --> 01:08:23,930
believes that we are all one and should
try to get along.

1543
01:08:23,990 --> 01:08:25,940
You don't want to hear Bro.
I hear new world order.

1544
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:28,310
That's what I hear.
This motherfucker's new world order.

1545
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:29,740
I can't hear you if we got him on the
show.

1546
01:08:31,250 --> 01:08:33,020
Is that what that,
was that an Alex Jones impression?

1547
01:08:33,090 --> 01:08:34,010
It was getting close,
wasn't it?

1548
01:08:34,190 --> 01:08:36,730
Alex Jones is a performance artist.
Is that what you're claiming?

1549
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:40,010
You know what,
I ask people on twitter what I should

1550
01:08:40,011 --> 01:08:45,011
ask you and overwhelmingly,
overwhelmingly it's all like why does he

1551
01:08:45,051 --> 01:08:49,220
legitimize quacks like Alex Jones
creates a false equivalents problem.

1552
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:49,821
Oh No,
no,

1553
01:08:49,821 --> 01:08:50,091
no,
no,

1554
01:08:50,091 --> 01:08:52,250
no.
Why did he interview so many bad act

1555
01:08:52,251 --> 01:08:54,620
actors like Alex Jones?
How many people do I interview?

1556
01:08:54,621 --> 01:08:56,930
Like Alex Jones?
First of all,

1557
01:08:57,170 --> 01:08:59,540
I don't interview anybody.
I'm not interviewing you,

1558
01:08:59,541 --> 01:09:00,320
am I?
Nope.

1559
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:01,490
I'm not an interviewer.
Um,

1560
01:09:01,940 --> 01:09:05,300
I suck at that.
I've kind of interviewed Ron miscavige

1561
01:09:05,330 --> 01:09:08,310
yesterday.
I talked to people and I record it.

1562
01:09:08,470 --> 01:09:10,700
It's it.
I'm not a journalist by any stretch of

1563
01:09:10,701 --> 01:09:13,010
the imagination.
Alice Joe has been my friend for 20

1564
01:09:13,011 --> 01:09:15,620
years.
He's fucking crazy.

1565
01:09:15,770 --> 01:09:19,370
I showed everybody how crazy he wasn't
my podcast by getting them high and

1566
01:09:19,371 --> 01:09:22,370
drunk and have them talk about inner
dimensional child molesters.

1567
01:09:22,670 --> 01:09:27,110
If you watch that and you think I'm
legitimising Alex Jones and some sort of

1568
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:28,220
way,
then you're just,

1569
01:09:28,290 --> 01:09:29,210
you're,
you're just,

1570
01:09:29,750 --> 01:09:31,610
you're looking at things in a very
cookie cutter,

1571
01:09:31,611 --> 01:09:33,800
wet.
You're deciding that this is what I've

1572
01:09:33,801 --> 01:09:35,660
done.
But a lot of people listen to you.

1573
01:09:35,660 --> 01:09:38,240
And so I think the criticism that these
people have is like,

1574
01:09:38,330 --> 01:09:42,320
people put faith in you and they assume
that if you don't raise a question

1575
01:09:42,321 --> 01:09:43,800
against something,
that that means that,

1576
01:09:43,970 --> 01:09:47,060
that you tacitly agree with what's being
said and that that'll,

1577
01:09:47,061 --> 01:09:50,450
that allows the physicians about Alex.
A lot of,

1578
01:09:50,451 --> 01:09:51,460
no,
I didn't listen to the Europe.

1579
01:09:51,660 --> 01:09:54,320
We raise questions,
but we were more bullshitting than

1580
01:09:54,321 --> 01:09:56,660
anything and having fun and he was
hammered.

1581
01:09:57,020 --> 01:09:57,590
I mean,
look,

1582
01:09:57,590 --> 01:10:00,890
people got a chance to see them.
They're actually using footage of the

1583
01:10:00,891 --> 01:10:04,840
conversation that we had against him and
his custody battle because they're

1584
01:10:04,850 --> 01:10:07,880
saying he was in Los Angeles on film
smoking marijuana.

1585
01:10:08,510 --> 01:10:12,640
He's a loose cannon and that's,
that's literally being used against

1586
01:10:12,641 --> 01:10:14,630
them.
He doesn't give a fuck.

1587
01:10:14,631 --> 01:10:15,464
Really?
They asked.

1588
01:10:16,370 --> 01:10:17,900
They asked him a question about his kid.
He couldn't remember.

1589
01:10:17,901 --> 01:10:18,500
It was op.
Sorry.

1590
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:20,030
I had a large bowl of Chili for lunch
today.

1591
01:10:20,030 --> 01:10:22,370
I can't remember.
He's fucking crazy.

1592
01:10:22,850 --> 01:10:26,670
He's crazy and he makes ridiculous
amounts of money out stones.

1593
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:29,480
He doesn't give a fuck.
He's a great guy.

1594
01:10:29,481 --> 01:10:30,770
I swear to God.
He's a great guy.

1595
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:34,340
He's just,
he's just got a ridiculous platform and

1596
01:10:34,341 --> 01:10:36,890
he's kind of character,
but he's he,

1597
01:10:36,891 --> 01:10:38,060
that's who he is,
man.

1598
01:10:38,150 --> 01:10:42,020
You think he's a performance artist?
I think there is a part of what he does

1599
01:10:42,021 --> 01:10:47,021
that is most certainly theater.
I think anybody who doesn't see that

1600
01:10:47,190 --> 01:10:49,400
goes out.
Todd comes in and todd comes out.

1601
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:50,990
That's bad impression.
You got to work on it.

1602
01:10:51,180 --> 01:10:52,690
It's almost as bad as my trump
impression.

1603
01:10:52,730 --> 01:10:54,490
Fortunately,
I never listened to Ellis Jones,

1604
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:57,800
so I don't actually know what he,
I mean I see clips of him when someone

1605
01:10:57,801 --> 01:11:01,190
shares something with me online,
but like life's too short to listen to

1606
01:11:01,191 --> 01:11:03,950
Alec's giant.
Just best clips or when he gets mad and

1607
01:11:03,951 --> 01:11:05,660
then he apologizes.
I'm a Christian.

1608
01:11:05,780 --> 01:11:09,260
I'm sorry.
He comes to someone.

1609
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:13,200
Someone said something about him
recently and he went all,

1610
01:11:13,201 --> 01:11:14,060
I never swear.
I never

1611
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:16,200
swearing at 20 years of nurse Warren on
the air,

1612
01:11:16,201 --> 01:11:20,400
but this fucking fat like
crazy.

1613
01:11:21,060 --> 01:11:23,290
Fucking crazy on this one guy and then
he's,

1614
01:11:23,310 --> 01:11:24,240
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1615
01:11:24,241 --> 01:11:25,830
I apologize.
I'm children listening.

1616
01:11:25,970 --> 01:11:28,560
This is wrong.
I mean he's fucking,

1617
01:11:28,561 --> 01:11:30,780
he's a maniac.
I'm not giving him,

1618
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:35,190
I'm not giving him legitimacy.
He already has a massive platform,

1619
01:11:35,220 --> 01:11:39,570
arguably bigger than mine.
What I'm doing is showing you what I see

1620
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:41,700
when I hang out with Alex Jones.
People are like,

1621
01:11:41,701 --> 01:11:42,960
why are you friends with Alex Jones?
I'm like,

1622
01:11:42,961 --> 01:11:44,820
he's a nice guy.
I like him.

1623
01:11:45,060 --> 01:11:47,850
Look,
I have a friend do I argued with for a

1624
01:11:47,850 --> 01:11:49,770
fucking hour yesterday,
thinks I'm pretty sure he thinks the

1625
01:11:49,771 --> 01:11:50,970
fucking world is flat.
Yeah.

1626
01:11:50,971 --> 01:11:53,460
That's another one that I got satellites
is Eddie Bravo.

1627
01:11:53,510 --> 01:11:55,170
Yeah.
He thinks satellites aren't real.

1628
01:11:55,260 --> 01:11:57,810
He doesn't believe in dinosaurs.
He thinks dinosaurs are bull bullshit.

1629
01:11:57,811 --> 01:11:59,130
He doesn't believe in nuclear bombs.

1630
01:11:59,340 --> 01:12:02,740
He's out to lunch.
He doesn't believe in nuclear bombs.

1631
01:12:02,950 --> 01:12:03,481
It,
listen,

1632
01:12:03,481 --> 01:12:04,314
man,
you can't,

1633
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:06,810
you can't even hold it to the fire.
It's,

1634
01:12:07,170 --> 01:12:09,870
it's ridiculous.
I don't understand his thought process,

1635
01:12:09,871 --> 01:12:11,640
and again,
I've been friends with him.

1636
01:12:11,670 --> 01:12:13,200
As long as I've been friends with Alex
Jones,

1637
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:15,180
I'm awake closer with Eddie,
way closer.

1638
01:12:15,181 --> 01:12:16,350
Like Ed.
He's one of my best friends.

1639
01:12:16,710 --> 01:12:19,410
He's fucking crazy.
But if you talked to him about

1640
01:12:19,411 --> 01:12:22,440
conspiracies,
but if you talk to them about like mma

1641
01:12:22,441 --> 01:12:24,120
or he's a jujitsu genius,
I mean,

1642
01:12:24,121 --> 01:12:27,990
he's like one of the very best Jujitsu
instructors on the planet earth.

1643
01:12:27,991 --> 01:12:28,770
Without a doubt.

1644
01:12:28,770 --> 01:12:29,541
I mean,
this is,

1645
01:12:29,541 --> 01:12:32,810
comes back again to the like how we can
compartmentalize our minds,

1646
01:12:32,811 --> 01:12:34,250
right?
It's like a religious person who

1647
01:12:34,251 --> 01:12:37,170
believes in the story of Jesus,
but he's also otherwise super

1648
01:12:37,171 --> 01:12:37,560
intelligent.

1649
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:39,060
That's a perfect analogy.
Yeah.

1650
01:12:39,190 --> 01:12:39,740
Yeah.
It's,

1651
01:12:39,740 --> 01:12:41,400
it's,
and you know,

1652
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:44,850
I don't know how people's brains work.
I don't understand.

1653
01:12:45,530 --> 01:12:46,351
I,
you know,

1654
01:12:46,351 --> 01:12:48,120
I've,
I've,

1655
01:12:48,121 --> 01:12:53,121
I've tried to study like people's really
irrational thinking and tried it,

1656
01:12:54,180 --> 01:12:56,350
but you know what?
I worry more than anything that worried

1657
01:12:56,351 --> 01:12:58,140
that it's contagious disease.

1658
01:12:58,450 --> 01:13:00,700
I think it is.
I think it is,

1659
01:13:00,940 --> 01:13:04,450
and this is why I'm a bit worried about
way we're at culturally at the moment

1660
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:09,960
because I think that concern about
irrationalism being contagious is not

1661
01:13:10,001 --> 01:13:14,950
too dissimilar from my concern about a
disrespect for the idea of truth and

1662
01:13:14,951 --> 01:13:19,030
falsehood being contagious.
So you know it when I was talking about

1663
01:13:19,060 --> 01:13:20,590
the,
the this analyst,

1664
01:13:20,591 --> 01:13:25,591
this Russian journalist who was talking
about the ways in which Putin and Chavez

1665
01:13:25,990 --> 01:13:29,140
and Atawan in Turkey and the Hungarian
dictator,

1666
01:13:29,860 --> 01:13:33,250
what not dictated Hungarian president
who was becoming a quad.

1667
01:13:33,251 --> 01:13:37,780
I dictated the way that they kind of use
the muddiness of the whole question of

1668
01:13:37,781 --> 01:13:42,781
what's true or false as a way of
throwing sand in the gears of the whole

1669
01:13:43,241 --> 01:13:47,110
democratic process and sand in the gears
of people's ability to kind of analyze

1670
01:13:47,111 --> 01:13:50,170
the world and figure out what's true and
false and what's important and not

1671
01:13:50,171 --> 01:13:55,171
important that if all you're doing every
day is just tweeting out like a stream

1672
01:13:55,211 --> 01:13:58,510
of nonsensical bullshit that is neither
true nor false but kind of exists in

1673
01:13:58,511 --> 01:14:02,440
like this area of like you are trump's
ego.

1674
01:14:03,430 --> 01:14:08,350
Then I actually have found myself
becoming less convinced about reliable

1675
01:14:08,351 --> 01:14:12,670
sources of information and myself
becoming more to irrational

1676
01:14:12,820 --> 01:14:16,270
ideas.
Like I don't feel as confident anymore.

1677
01:14:16,870 --> 01:14:20,710
Like it's easy because there's so much,
you see so much stuff of like I'll tweet

1678
01:14:20,711 --> 01:14:24,220
out something that the Washington Post
or the Wall Street Journal or The New

1679
01:14:24,220 --> 01:14:25,670
York Times,
uh,

1680
01:14:25,870 --> 01:14:28,660
have published,
all of which I regard as being

1681
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:32,980
upstanding publications where I have
faith that the journalists are doing

1682
01:14:32,981 --> 01:14:34,510
their best,
not always perfectly,

1683
01:14:34,570 --> 01:14:38,830
but doing their best in the long haul to
tell the truth and only report facts and

1684
01:14:38,831 --> 01:14:39,990
then people will say,
oh,

1685
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:40,930
fake news,
fake news.

1686
01:14:40,931 --> 01:14:42,940
That is the bullshit.
And they'll link to something to Alex

1687
01:14:42,940 --> 01:14:45,610
Jones said is if there's kind of a kind
of equivalence between those two things.

1688
01:14:45,910 --> 01:14:49,960
And I have to remind myself to an actual
specific thing.

1689
01:14:49,961 --> 01:14:52,090
You're just speaking in generality.
People have linked,

1690
01:14:52,091 --> 01:14:56,110
people have told me that they believe
there's no difference between the

1691
01:14:56,111 --> 01:14:58,900
credibility of Alex Jones and the
credibility of the New York Times,

1692
01:15:05,410 --> 01:15:07,720
New York Times talking about the
interdimensional child molesters.

1693
01:15:08,230 --> 01:15:09,550
Not yet,
but let's give him time.

1694
01:15:09,551 --> 01:15:10,670
Joe.
It's a,

1695
01:15:10,671 --> 01:15:14,050
its early days.
It was administration times has fucked

1696
01:15:14,051 --> 01:15:15,210
up in the past.
Yeah.

1697
01:15:15,250 --> 01:15:19,540
And they,
they have strayed from unbiased

1698
01:15:19,541 --> 01:15:22,150
journalism,
which is an issue because as soon as you

1699
01:15:22,151 --> 01:15:25,000
start doing that,
as soon as you editorialize the news,

1700
01:15:25,420 --> 01:15:29,410
you open yourself up for people who
point out that you editorialize the news

1701
01:15:29,411 --> 01:15:32,620
and then point out the fact that you're
biased and they have but hold on,

1702
01:15:32,650 --> 01:15:36,190
they have been not that that's an issue.
And I think they realize that they,

1703
01:15:36,370 --> 01:15:39,370
that has been used against them.
And I think that's one of the things

1704
01:15:39,371 --> 01:15:44,371
that they addressed when they talked
about sort of reinvigorating the idea of

1705
01:15:45,821 --> 01:15:48,280
objective journalism.
And they started talking about that

1706
01:15:48,281 --> 01:15:52,390
after the uh,
the trump election after he was elected

1707
01:15:52,391 --> 01:15:55,690
president.
They talked about this a reinvigoration

1708
01:15:55,691 --> 01:15:58,900
and this sort of re re committing
themselves to,

1709
01:15:58,940 --> 01:16:00,190
to real hard journalists.

1710
01:16:00,250 --> 01:16:02,230
That's right.
I think a lot of people also had done

1711
01:16:02,231 --> 01:16:05,050
understand the difference between the
editorial page and like the opinion

1712
01:16:05,051 --> 01:16:09,790
pages and the news section is true,
but even the new section has been

1713
01:16:09,791 --> 01:16:10,900
biased.
You know,

1714
01:16:10,980 --> 01:16:13,090
there,
there have been storms in a couple of

1715
01:16:13,091 --> 01:16:16,450
occasions been things we have a blind I
think yeah they have.

1716
01:16:16,451 --> 01:16:19,090
But as soon as you just leave open that
potential,

1717
01:16:19,091 --> 01:16:20,380
that possibility,
then people go,

1718
01:16:20,410 --> 01:16:21,550
oh,
you're a bunch of left wingers.

1719
01:16:21,551 --> 01:16:24,110
Like a lot of people think that because
they got the election wrong,

1720
01:16:24,140 --> 01:16:27,320
that means that you can't trust Paul's.
He's another way in which in which they,

1721
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:30,730
this kind of insidious idea that nothing
is trustworthy and there's no such thing

1722
01:16:30,731 --> 01:16:34,360
as the truth or facts or you'll version
of history is as good as anyone's

1723
01:16:34,361 --> 01:16:36,100
version of history.
This is another thing that Lawrence

1724
01:16:36,100 --> 01:16:37,540
Krauss was saying on my podcast by the
way,

1725
01:16:37,870 --> 01:16:42,730
which is he thinks that there's a link
between the kind of postmodern like

1726
01:16:42,731 --> 01:16:46,420
hippie 1960s like philosopher movement
of like,

1727
01:16:46,421 --> 01:16:48,190
Hey,
believe whatever you want to man.

1728
01:16:48,191 --> 01:16:49,630
Like there is no truth,
right?

1729
01:16:49,631 --> 01:16:53,410
Like truth is all salt socially
constructed and like gender is entirely

1730
01:16:53,411 --> 01:16:56,020
socially constructed and there was no
such thing as masculinity.

1731
01:16:56,170 --> 01:16:57,190
It's all just,
I don't know,

1732
01:16:57,191 --> 01:17:00,070
some kind of capitalist story that we've
all been led to believe.

1733
01:17:00,071 --> 01:17:03,730
So I like put a flower in your hair and
bust out of it and let your truth be

1734
01:17:03,731 --> 01:17:07,660
whatever that you want the truth to be.
He stays a link between that and what

1735
01:17:07,661 --> 01:17:09,710
you might think of as being something
opposite,

1736
01:17:09,711 --> 01:17:10,400
which is

1737
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:15,400
the hard right kind of outright trumpy
sort of fake news phenomenon because

1738
01:17:17,271 --> 01:17:22,271
both of them make the claim that there's
no such thing as the truth essentially.

1739
01:17:22,550 --> 01:17:24,680
And your truth is whatever is true for
you.

1740
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:26,810
There were a million people and a dog.
I didn't alteration.

1741
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:30,200
Okay.
The warships were steaming towards North

1742
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:31,250
Korea.
Okay.

1743
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:33,120
Trump said it.
Does it matter?

1744
01:17:33,160 --> 01:17:34,490
Terrible.
This is true or not true.

1745
01:17:34,790 --> 01:17:37,730
What's,
let's unpack that one step at a time.

1746
01:17:38,030 --> 01:17:41,210
Um,
I definitely think that some of the,

1747
01:17:41,300 --> 01:17:45,020
as we said before,
some of the reasons why trump became

1748
01:17:45,021 --> 01:17:50,021
popular are these ridiculous assertions
that gender has no basis in biology.

1749
01:17:54,470 --> 01:17:57,560
That you can be anything you want.
You can be Fox.

1750
01:17:57,561 --> 01:17:59,390
Can you know that you can,
you know,

1751
01:17:59,540 --> 01:18:01,520
you can identify with being,
I mean there's,

1752
01:18:01,521 --> 01:18:04,790
there's people that are trying to figure
out whether or not trans racial is a

1753
01:18:04,791 --> 01:18:05,450
thing.

1754
01:18:05,450 --> 01:18:10,450
Rachel Dolezal was on CNN and she was
talking about the fact that race is a

1755
01:18:11,391 --> 01:18:13,250
social construct is interesting,
wasn't it?

1756
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:16,250
It is interesting because people don't
want to accept that black people get

1757
01:18:16,251 --> 01:18:18,050
really mad.
They're getting really mad at her.

1758
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:23,120
They also say the same thing.
Like I mean anytime worth their salt

1759
01:18:23,150 --> 01:18:25,410
understands that race is not a genetic
thing,

1760
01:18:25,411 --> 01:18:29,930
that this is a cultural construct.
And I mean I find it,

1761
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:34,960
I find her logic sort of hard to flow in
to fault in a way is most sort of social

1762
01:18:35,391 --> 01:18:38,030
construct.
It's most certainly more solid than

1763
01:18:38,031 --> 01:18:40,730
saying there's no biological basis for
gender.

1764
01:18:40,820 --> 01:18:43,340
That's right.
There's more biological basis to six

1765
01:18:43,341 --> 01:18:44,450
than there is to,
you know,

1766
01:18:44,451 --> 01:18:49,280
there's more sex chromosomal issue.
There's an x,

1767
01:18:49,281 --> 01:18:54,230
y chromosome that males have and if a
male decides that he identifies with

1768
01:18:54,231 --> 01:18:55,490
being a female,
look,

1769
01:18:55,491 --> 01:18:58,190
there's a boy that's running track now
there's a new one,

1770
01:18:58,191 --> 01:19:01,550
cause they've had a few of these is the
one who was a girl that was a wrestler

1771
01:19:01,551 --> 01:19:03,020
that was taking,
she wanted to be a boy.

1772
01:19:03,170 --> 01:19:05,750
So she was taking testosterone and
crushing all these other girls in

1773
01:19:05,751 --> 01:19:07,550
wrestling.
She won the state title in Texas,

1774
01:19:07,551 --> 01:19:09,880
I think you mean he was a trans,
whatever,

1775
01:19:09,890 --> 01:19:12,320
whatever.
But now there's a boy who's not even

1776
01:19:12,321 --> 01:19:16,310
taking treatment who decides he
identifies as a girl and he's just

1777
01:19:16,370 --> 01:19:19,250
whooping everybody's ass and track cause
he's a fucking boy.

1778
01:19:19,660 --> 01:19:21,250
But no,
he's a girl but he's not a boy.

1779
01:19:21,350 --> 01:19:24,350
He's not a girl.
We have to find a way to like separate

1780
01:19:24,351 --> 01:19:26,660
the psychologic,
the psychology from the physiology,

1781
01:19:27,580 --> 01:19:28,850
especially in sports.
Exactly.

1782
01:19:28,851 --> 01:19:30,890
100%,
especially in combat sports.

1783
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:33,140
And I,
I took a lot of heat because I was

1784
01:19:33,141 --> 01:19:35,690
saying that there was a,
there was a man who was a man for 30

1785
01:19:35,691 --> 01:19:38,180
years.
It became a woman and didn't tell people

1786
01:19:38,300 --> 01:19:41,220
that he used to be a man for 30 years
and beat the fuck out of two checks

1787
01:19:41,870 --> 01:19:43,520
before eventually came out.

1788
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:44,930
And now when,
once your out look,

1789
01:19:44,931 --> 01:19:48,020
I say especially in professional sports,
um,

1790
01:19:48,140 --> 01:19:49,760
you have,
you have,

1791
01:19:49,761 --> 01:19:50,361
uh,
uh,

1792
01:19:50,361 --> 01:19:54,530
right,
like two to say no or to say yes to

1793
01:19:54,531 --> 01:19:57,440
compete against that person.
I think if a woman wants to fight

1794
01:19:57,441 --> 01:19:59,900
against a man,
if a woman's 130 pounds and she wants to

1795
01:19:59,901 --> 01:20:02,150
fight against a man as 130 pounds,
they both agree.

1796
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:04,430
Do whatever you want.
I think you should be allowed to.

1797
01:20:04,700 --> 01:20:08,340
But I think that there's a big
difference between who has been a man.

1798
01:20:08,341 --> 01:20:11,700
Their whole life has said testosterone
flowing through their bones,

1799
01:20:11,790 --> 01:20:12,960
their blood,
their body,

1800
01:20:12,961 --> 01:20:15,990
their whole life,
and then decides they're a woman versus

1801
01:20:15,991 --> 01:20:17,670
a woman who was born,
a woman,

1802
01:20:17,700 --> 01:20:20,970
raised a woman,
and as a biological woman her entire

1803
01:20:20,971 --> 01:20:23,880
life,
a transgender woman just is not a

1804
01:20:23,881 --> 01:20:25,590
regular biological woman.
It's this,

1805
01:20:25,591 --> 01:20:26,550
it's,
there's a difference,

1806
01:20:26,730 --> 01:20:31,620
but saying that gets people so angry
saying that a transgender woman who you

1807
01:20:31,621 --> 01:20:33,270
can say as a woman,
I say that,

1808
01:20:33,271 --> 01:20:36,720
but saying that they're the same thing
as a biological woman is just not

1809
01:20:36,721 --> 01:20:38,910
factually true.
Well was a different,

1810
01:20:38,911 --> 01:20:41,250
they have different chromosomes.
They have a different structure.

1811
01:20:41,251 --> 01:20:44,130
The hips are built different,
the shoulders are wider,

1812
01:20:44,131 --> 01:20:46,530
the hands are big.
There's so many factors.

1813
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:48,820
That's right.
This is what makes people so frustrated

1814
01:20:48,821 --> 01:20:51,240
about the whole political correctness
thing,

1815
01:20:51,241 --> 01:20:54,190
right?
That we set up trip wires and if you

1816
01:20:54,191 --> 01:20:56,590
trigger one of those tripwires by making
a claim,

1817
01:20:56,591 --> 01:20:59,320
like the one you just made,
which is that a trans woman is not

1818
01:20:59,350 --> 01:21:02,560
exactly the same as a cis woman and non
trans.

1819
01:21:02,650 --> 01:21:03,220
Well,
no,

1820
01:21:03,220 --> 01:21:05,440
I'm not using sis again.
Not going to do it.

1821
01:21:05,470 --> 01:21:06,640
Not Real.
What do you wanna call them?

1822
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:10,990
Disease.
I'll go with Z.

1823
01:21:10,990 --> 01:21:14,290
Z.
Z is the z instead of she for a trends.

1824
01:21:14,470 --> 01:21:14,951
No,
it's not.

1825
01:21:14,951 --> 01:21:17,410
Instead of she needs a shit.
Sorry,

1826
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:18,850
did I just triggered one on the
tripwires.

1827
01:21:18,851 --> 01:21:20,840
Did I?
It's non-gender base.

1828
01:21:21,820 --> 01:21:26,820
It is a non gender base.
It's he or she for people who don't have

1829
01:21:27,011 --> 01:21:29,020
agenda,
it's what the fuck it is.

1830
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:32,130
And you sitting over there as,
as as a male.

1831
01:21:32,490 --> 01:21:34,690
It was an actual mail.
I'm a CIS male.

1832
01:21:34,790 --> 01:21:36,520
Yes.
Yeah.

1833
01:21:36,700 --> 01:21:40,690
Not an actual male biological male.
All men have penises.

1834
01:21:41,170 --> 01:21:43,030
I had buck angel on.
Oh yeah.

1835
01:21:43,090 --> 01:21:48,090
Who's a Trans Jans Jan who uses the term
biological male.

1836
01:21:48,340 --> 01:21:50,620
He says there's a difference between
biological man.

1837
01:21:50,621 --> 01:21:54,490
He was born a woman and then
transitioned to being a man and he says,

1838
01:21:54,491 --> 01:21:58,210
biological male,
and he says that Trans people hate on

1839
01:21:58,211 --> 01:22:01,880
him for using the term biological.
Well,

1840
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:05,410
what does he mean by the term?
It was someone who has x,

1841
01:22:05,411 --> 01:22:08,680
y chromosome,
a biological male versus him who has x,

1842
01:22:08,681 --> 01:22:09,110
x,
y,

1843
01:22:09,110 --> 01:22:09,943
Z.
I see.

1844
01:22:10,660 --> 01:22:12,980
I thought you meant that he calls
himself a biological male.

1845
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:14,710
People biology.
Yeah,

1846
01:22:14,711 --> 01:22:15,431
sure.
He's like,

1847
01:22:15,431 --> 01:22:17,110
you should,
you should be able to differentiate

1848
01:22:17,111 --> 01:22:20,380
without being prejudiced.
It's so,

1849
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:22,570
I mean ha,

1850
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:26,810
it's crazy.
Crazy town.

1851
01:22:27,090 --> 01:22:29,940
I just think that people should be able
to live however they want to live their

1852
01:22:29,941 --> 01:22:30,960
lives.
And so I don't,

1853
01:22:30,980 --> 01:22:33,660
you know,
I don't spend a lot of time thinking

1854
01:22:33,661 --> 01:22:35,670
about this,
but I just wished that we were all

1855
01:22:35,671 --> 01:22:39,510
generous enough that when people find it
a little bit difficult to understand,

1856
01:22:39,511 --> 01:22:43,170
you don't assume that they're bigoted
just because it's a new concept for

1857
01:22:43,171 --> 01:22:44,004
them.
Because,

1858
01:22:44,260 --> 01:22:47,550
and I think as you say it,
this is part of what gave rise to trump.

1859
01:22:47,570 --> 01:22:49,650
The,
I mean the,

1860
01:22:49,860 --> 01:22:53,130
the parallel that I was drawing a moment
ago between like post structuralist,

1861
01:22:53,131 --> 01:22:58,131
there is no such thing as gender and
trump's fake news campaign was not so

1862
01:22:58,231 --> 01:23:01,680
much that all the one led to the other.
It was just that both,

1863
01:23:01,710 --> 01:23:05,680
this is the point that Lawrence Krauss
was making both undermine the,

1864
01:23:05,710 --> 01:23:07,690
they both erode the idea of truth

1865
01:23:08,230 --> 01:23:12,460
and what's ironic is it,
it's almost exactly the same thing that

1866
01:23:12,461 --> 01:23:15,490
bill o'reilly said.
The tie goes in the time it comes out.

1867
01:23:15,640 --> 01:23:18,310
People push this way and then people go,
fuck you.

1868
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:21,820
There is a biological difference and
then they pushed that way and then they

1869
01:23:21,821 --> 01:23:23,050
get,
they get transphobic.

1870
01:23:23,170 --> 01:23:25,630
I mean there's,
there's a lot of people to get upset at

1871
01:23:25,631 --> 01:23:27,940
ridiculous ideas and then they get,

1872
01:23:28,150 --> 01:23:30,970
they go overboard and go the other way.
It's so stupid.

1873
01:23:30,971 --> 01:23:33,580
Like Louis Ck has that bit of bad gay
people as well.

1874
01:23:33,581 --> 01:23:34,414
He's like,
I don't understand.

1875
01:23:34,750 --> 01:23:39,750
I don't understand why people get angry
at the existence of gay people even if

1876
01:23:39,761 --> 01:23:41,890
they're not in their lives.
He's like even better.

1877
01:23:41,891 --> 01:23:43,210
The,
the gay marriage thing.

1878
01:23:43,570 --> 01:23:44,590
Yeah,
exactly.

1879
01:23:44,620 --> 01:23:47,350
People get furious.
Louie says,

1880
01:23:47,351 --> 01:23:50,560
like I would understand if like there
were a couple of guys fucking on my lawn

1881
01:23:50,561 --> 01:23:52,240
and I had to like hose him down to get
them.

1882
01:23:52,241 --> 01:23:55,480
Or like gay people were just like
touching their dicks in front of my face

1883
01:23:55,481 --> 01:23:57,010
as I'm trying to eat my breakfast
cereal.

1884
01:23:57,100 --> 01:23:58,960
Right.
But as long as they're not bothering me,

1885
01:23:58,961 --> 01:24:02,920
I don't understand the point in getting
upset about their mere existence out

1886
01:24:02,921 --> 01:24:04,030
there.
Yeah,

1887
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:06,760
and it's the same with trans people.
I don't understand why there's this big

1888
01:24:06,761 --> 01:24:08,020
thing about trans people.

1889
01:24:08,260 --> 01:24:10,300
I understand.
It's silly what I mean.

1890
01:24:10,301 --> 01:24:15,130
This comes to also like people who are
currently obsessed with political

1891
01:24:15,131 --> 01:24:17,920
correctness as being the biggest problem
facing America today.

1892
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:21,760
I feel like have missed the boat.
They're fighting the last year's battle.

1893
01:24:21,761 --> 01:24:25,150
They're fighting yesterday's battle when
the actual battle to fight is the day

1894
01:24:25,150 --> 01:24:25,601
before yesterday,
his battle,

1895
01:24:25,601 --> 01:24:28,030
which is today's battle,
which is a battle against bigotry,

1896
01:24:28,031 --> 01:24:30,450
I think,
which is a battle against trump,

1897
01:24:30,451 --> 01:24:32,950
like battle against the idea of fake
news,

1898
01:24:32,951 --> 01:24:36,640
a battle against America eventually
having its own pew.

1899
01:24:36,710 --> 01:24:39,580
Putin likes strong man.
Anyone who's spending all of their time

1900
01:24:39,581 --> 01:24:42,760
doing all of their shows about how
terrible political correctness is.

1901
01:24:42,761 --> 01:24:44,650
And you know,
Milo Yiannopoulos should be able to say

1902
01:24:44,651 --> 01:24:47,570
whatever he wants,
which of course he should is not I think

1903
01:24:47,571 --> 01:24:49,420
as like well political correct.

1904
01:24:49,510 --> 01:24:54,510
Yes.
Is a response to people feeling that

1905
01:24:55,351 --> 01:24:57,990
there's an injustice.
People feeling that there is bigotry and

1906
01:24:57,991 --> 01:25:00,330
prejudice and so they go too far with
it.

1907
01:25:00,331 --> 01:25:04,380
They get ridiculous and it's also a
natural human inclination to try to

1908
01:25:04,381 --> 01:25:07,800
control other people's behavior.
People like to be bossy and they like to

1909
01:25:07,801 --> 01:25:09,780
be able to tell you what you can and
can't do.

1910
01:25:09,990 --> 01:25:12,210
They like to tell you what words you can
and can't use.

1911
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:17,280
It's a weird thing that people do and it
may be a response to the frustration

1912
01:25:17,281 --> 01:25:21,990
that they feel legitimate frustration
from actual bigotry and it makes them go

1913
01:25:21,991 --> 01:25:24,000
overboard.
It makes them go too far.

1914
01:25:24,210 --> 01:25:26,250
Yes.
It's a lack of perspective on both

1915
01:25:26,251 --> 01:25:28,920
sides.
That's a giant issue with human beings.

1916
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:29,751
Yeah,
and you know what?

1917
01:25:29,751 --> 01:25:32,480
I think it actually was like the past
few times that we've,

1918
01:25:32,580 --> 01:25:35,240
we've gotten together and shot the shit
on this show.

1919
01:25:35,690 --> 01:25:39,860
Political correctness and the extremes
of it have been a major topic of

1920
01:25:39,861 --> 01:25:42,530
conversation.
And I think justly so.

1921
01:25:42,860 --> 01:25:47,860
But I do think that last year with the
election of trump and the kind of

1922
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:54,160
welling up of kind of subtly anti
Semitic coded racially coded language

1923
01:25:54,831 --> 01:25:55,640
during the,
the,

1924
01:25:55,640 --> 01:25:59,030
the election campaign last year.
Why do you claim rent antisemetic when

1925
01:25:59,031 --> 01:26:01,990
jared Kushner is like his main guy.
And I don't think trump has an anti

1926
01:26:01,991 --> 01:26:04,000
semite I don't think trump hates.
So is he

1927
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,650
a nice romantic?
A lot of people who support trump.

1928
01:26:06,870 --> 01:26:08,390
Hmm.
Right.

1929
01:26:08,570 --> 01:26:10,520
But there's no evidence that he is
right?

1930
01:26:10,580 --> 01:26:11,600
I don't think so.
No.

1931
01:26:11,601 --> 01:26:14,390
I think he's just an old,
an old white guy.

1932
01:26:14,420 --> 01:26:17,060
I think he's an old white guy with
traditional ideas about,

1933
01:26:17,510 --> 01:26:21,470
about what made America great and those
traditional ideas coincide with an

1934
01:26:21,471 --> 01:26:26,471
America that was a lot wider and more
Christian than the country that we say

1935
01:26:26,721 --> 01:26:28,460
today.
I think that's the way it becomes

1936
01:26:28,461 --> 01:26:31,460
racially coded.
Never even been a religious person.

1937
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:33,860
Really interesting.
Isn't it?

1938
01:26:33,980 --> 01:26:37,000
Talk about no children of God.
You should be forced to suffer.

1939
01:26:37,001 --> 01:26:39,140
Shut to feet,
such a fraud.

1940
01:26:39,141 --> 01:26:42,290
He's such a go and get your steak knives
and your trump university dude.

1941
01:26:42,291 --> 01:26:42,921
It's like,
you know,

1942
01:26:42,921 --> 01:26:44,690
he's a charlatan.
Trump steaks,

1943
01:26:45,160 --> 01:26:46,730
steaks.
Amazing.

1944
01:26:46,731 --> 01:26:49,880
Shizzy how fucking corrupt the religious
right off.

1945
01:26:49,890 --> 01:26:51,740
I haven't gotten behind him so quickly.

1946
01:26:51,890 --> 01:26:53,840
When he was,
he went down to Liberty University.

1947
01:26:53,841 --> 01:26:54,950
He gave a speech.
He was like,

1948
01:26:55,370 --> 01:26:57,530
you know the my favorite part of the
Bible,

1949
01:26:57,560 --> 01:27:01,130
two Corinthians pronounced two
Corinthians.

1950
01:27:01,131 --> 01:27:03,680
It's second Corinthians every evening.
Even if you just went to,

1951
01:27:04,230 --> 01:27:05,900
went to Bible school when you were a
kid,

1952
01:27:05,901 --> 01:27:08,390
you remember that,
so they know he's a fraud.

1953
01:27:08,810 --> 01:27:11,030
He was asked by an interviewer or what
his favorite part of the Bible is.

1954
01:27:11,031 --> 01:27:11,601
He was like,
well,

1955
01:27:11,601 --> 01:27:13,180
I'm not going to get into that kind of
personal,

1956
01:27:13,190 --> 01:27:14,300
you know,
that's personal.

1957
01:27:14,490 --> 01:27:17,480
He hadn't read the fucking Bible.
He doesn't pray.

1958
01:27:17,481 --> 01:27:20,200
He's got his own Bible going to answer.
I wrote it exactly.

1959
01:27:20,210 --> 01:27:23,990
This is where I'm at night in his
underwear and he talks and somebody

1960
01:27:23,991 --> 01:27:26,510
writes it down one day.
That'll be the Bible.

1961
01:27:26,511 --> 01:27:28,880
The Best Bible.
He'd been an amazing Bible.

1962
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:31,540
So they're all corrupt and full of shit.
Uh,

1963
01:27:31,550 --> 01:27:33,080
the religious right for getting behind
him.

1964
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:35,870
When they always talk about how
important personal faith is in that,

1965
01:27:35,930 --> 01:27:38,480
in their candidates.
What else are they going to do?

1966
01:27:38,481 --> 01:27:39,890
They go towards Hillary.
I mean,

1967
01:27:39,891 --> 01:27:40,970
what are we going,
I mean,

1968
01:27:40,971 --> 01:27:42,440
sorry,
I mean during the primary,

1969
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:44,660
but who else would they go with?
He's going to win.

1970
01:27:44,690 --> 01:27:47,210
They knew he was Ted Cruz didn't have a
shot.

1971
01:27:47,480 --> 01:27:50,060
He's too wormy.
People see him sweat too much.

1972
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:51,950
It's too of weird.
Easily lost the election.

1973
01:27:51,951 --> 01:27:53,450
But what,
but what I'm saying is they would

1974
01:27:53,451 --> 01:27:54,950
rather,
yeah,

1975
01:27:54,951 --> 01:27:56,810
they would rather have Donald Trump win
the election.

1976
01:27:56,811 --> 01:27:59,620
Then have ted Cruz will lose the
election on with principles,

1977
01:28:00,220 --> 01:28:02,390
which is amazing because you now you see
people saying,

1978
01:28:02,391 --> 01:28:05,960
I wish Ted Cruz was in office.
Like there's a lot of people on the left

1979
01:28:05,961 --> 01:28:07,520
that would have been happy with Ted
Cruz.

1980
01:28:07,730 --> 01:28:08,481
Yeah.
No,

1981
01:28:08,481 --> 01:28:09,350
not me.
Well,

1982
01:28:09,351 --> 01:28:13,550
he's really anti gay.
He's very anti gay and he's very smart.

1983
01:28:13,550 --> 01:28:14,480
He's extremely,
you know,

1984
01:28:14,481 --> 01:28:17,480
he was like a champion of the Harvard
debating team.

1985
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:19,130
Apparently.
I think it was Harvard.

1986
01:28:19,380 --> 01:28:22,180
I think he's gay.
I reckon.

1987
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:25,250
You Reckon?
What do you think when you look at them?

1988
01:28:25,510 --> 01:28:26,450
You got Gaydar,
right?

1989
01:28:26,570 --> 01:28:28,790
Yeah,
I do have good guy being a gay man.

1990
01:28:28,791 --> 01:28:29,990
Can you pick out cajuns?
Yeah,

1991
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,070
I'll if you're in a room.
Yup.

1992
01:28:31,450 --> 01:28:32,540
Yeah,
yeah.

1993
01:28:32,541 --> 01:28:34,080
I'm pretty good.
I'm pretty good at it.

1994
01:28:34,081 --> 01:28:35,960
Huh?
What do you think really?

1995
01:28:35,990 --> 01:28:36,960
He gives,
there's a,

1996
01:28:37,540 --> 01:28:39,080
on the,
on the conservative,

1997
01:28:39,081 --> 01:28:42,520
right?
There's a fine line between slimy ass

1998
01:28:42,521 --> 01:28:45,110
hole and closeted gay.
You know what I mean?

1999
01:28:45,140 --> 01:28:47,270
You don't think there's some connection,
some,

2000
01:28:47,540 --> 01:28:48,990
some like,
well no,

2001
01:28:49,250 --> 01:28:51,110
I'm saying they could rise or
relationship.

2002
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:54,500
It could be,
but the problem is that they never

2003
01:28:54,501 --> 01:28:58,610
underlying root system fungus that sort
of connects.

2004
01:28:59,420 --> 01:29:02,070
They communicate via electronic using
fungal.

2005
01:29:02,220 --> 01:29:03,540
Yeah.
Deep under the surface.

2006
01:29:03,540 --> 01:29:05,880
Pray the gay away as possible,
but they often are.

2007
01:29:05,910 --> 01:29:08,220
They also like,
Ted Haggard is a good example.

2008
01:29:08,550 --> 01:29:09,810
Right?
You remember that guy?

2009
01:29:09,811 --> 01:29:11,910
Yeah,
he was,

2010
01:29:12,060 --> 01:29:13,460
he seemed gay,
didn't he?

2011
01:29:13,461 --> 01:29:17,070
He had a little like his sibilance swear
a little bit.

2012
01:29:17,300 --> 01:29:21,550
S E s s list bees and gay.
But I didn't get it.

2013
01:29:22,020 --> 01:29:26,280
I don't know cause I'm like obviously
not the most gay presenting person that

2014
01:29:26,281 --> 01:29:27,960
you've ever met.
So I think that work.

2015
01:29:28,380 --> 01:29:29,213
Yeah,
I don't know.

2016
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:32,160
It's fascinating though,
isn't that present as gay?

2017
01:29:32,870 --> 01:29:34,680
Here's part of the thing about gender as
well.

2018
01:29:34,681 --> 01:29:36,600
This is the right is it brings us back
to Rachel dollars,

2019
01:29:36,601 --> 01:29:38,100
Ireland,
rice and stuff like that.

2020
01:29:38,101 --> 01:29:43,101
Like obviously,
so maybe there is some biological reason

2021
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:49,160
why do to or attracted to dude's tend to
exhibit mannerisms that are more

2022
01:29:51,361 --> 01:29:53,850
commonly associated with femininity.
Right.

2023
01:29:53,851 --> 01:29:57,570
Maybe a sing song.
He voice I certain style of walking,

2024
01:29:57,720 --> 01:30:02,720
Swish sashaying a swishy sort of
my friends that I was talking to about

2025
01:30:03,091 --> 01:30:03,924
the coppell.

2026
01:30:03,990 --> 01:30:06,290
Very clear.
Male and female and the relation,

2027
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:09,220
interesting.
One of them does appear gay.

2028
01:30:09,221 --> 01:30:10,740
Like if you got him to be like,
oh that's a gay guy,

2029
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:13,200
but the other guy,
you would have to know him.

2030
01:30:13,320 --> 01:30:14,850
Right?
You wouldn't know.

2031
01:30:15,060 --> 01:30:17,850
And so,
but then so what I think if there's a

2032
01:30:17,851 --> 01:30:21,600
kernel of biology in that,
I think it's been ramped up aggressively

2033
01:30:21,601 --> 01:30:25,890
over the past century by people also
playing the role of gay in the same way

2034
01:30:25,891 --> 01:30:28,710
that masculine dudes play the role of,
you know,

2035
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:33,060
masculine structures will play the role
of masculinity and girls will play the

2036
01:30:33,061 --> 01:30:37,290
role of being girly and in that respect,
people who point out the gender is not

2037
01:30:37,291 --> 01:30:41,370
the same as sex or right.
Like gender is a bunch of behavioral

2038
01:30:42,120 --> 01:30:45,960
tropes that we will act out.
And so it's interesting to me like when

2039
01:30:45,961 --> 01:30:48,870
you say,
why are Gay People Gay People Act Gay.

2040
01:30:50,190 --> 01:30:52,160
Part of it must be an act.
What was theirs?

2041
01:30:52,290 --> 01:30:54,830
Maybe to telegraph to each other maybe.
Yeah.

2042
01:30:55,200 --> 01:31:00,150
But there's also just this broad
spectrum of individuals is so different.

2043
01:31:00,450 --> 01:31:01,283
I mean there's,
there's,

2044
01:31:01,410 --> 01:31:04,890
there's masculine people that are so
incredibly different than other

2045
01:31:04,891 --> 01:31:07,950
masculine people,
Feminine Women that are so incredibly

2046
01:31:07,951 --> 01:31:10,380
different than other feminine women.
I mean just people were,

2047
01:31:10,530 --> 01:31:14,560
they vary very widely biologically,
socially they,

2048
01:31:14,660 --> 01:31:17,730
they vary by their own neurochemistry.
I mean,

2049
01:31:17,731 --> 01:31:20,700
there's people that are just almost
naturally inclined to be depressed.

2050
01:31:20,940 --> 01:31:23,610
There's some people that you could shit
right in their hair and they'd be

2051
01:31:23,611 --> 01:31:25,410
fucking happiest peaches.
It's just,

2052
01:31:25,710 --> 01:31:26,850
people are weird,
man.

2053
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:29,250
I'm a pretty happy person.
Where do you think you lie on that

2054
01:31:29,251 --> 01:31:31,170
spectrum of happiness?
I'm pretty happy.

2055
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:32,850
Yeah.
But I worked at it.

2056
01:31:33,450 --> 01:31:38,450
I'm pretty aware of the pitfalls of like
inactivity and I'm very,

2057
01:31:39,361 --> 01:31:41,250
I mean,
I exercise a lot,

2058
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:45,060
but even how the ability to motivate
yourself to take action is also

2059
01:31:45,061 --> 01:31:48,480
something that you'll need to have.
Yeah,

2060
01:31:48,481 --> 01:31:51,150
I guess.
But how much of that is from learned

2061
01:31:51,151 --> 01:31:54,480
behavior?
How much of that is from what,

2062
01:31:54,570 --> 01:31:56,100
you know,
the way I grew up,

2063
01:31:56,160 --> 01:31:57,540
there's a lot of factors.
Yeah.

2064
01:31:57,810 --> 01:31:58,590
Yeah,
there are,

2065
01:31:58,590 --> 01:32:00,580
my parents did not exercise

2066
01:32:00,940 --> 01:32:03,550
at all,
like fucking zero.

2067
01:32:03,790 --> 01:32:05,350
When I was growing up.
Zero.

2068
01:32:05,730 --> 01:32:08,470
They would come home from work and drink
and uh,

2069
01:32:08,890 --> 01:32:10,120
I did.
I just was like,

2070
01:32:10,660 --> 01:32:14,110
I gotta do something with this body.
This body wants to go to war.

2071
01:32:14,140 --> 01:32:17,290
I gotta I gotta get out and run.
I gotta hit a punching bag.

2072
01:32:17,291 --> 01:32:18,760
I've got to lift some weight.
I've got to do something.

2073
01:32:19,210 --> 01:32:20,950
I was just always like,
ah,

2074
01:32:20,980 --> 01:32:24,730
like I felt like there was an engine
inside of me that was revving up all the

2075
01:32:24,731 --> 01:32:26,800
time and I had to go run it.
If I didn't,

2076
01:32:26,890 --> 01:32:31,890
I didn't get out there and push it.
I didn't feel calm and it took me till I

2077
01:32:32,381 --> 01:32:34,300
was like a teenager before I figured
that out.

2078
01:32:34,540 --> 01:32:36,820
And then once I figured that out and
once I started exercising,

2079
01:32:36,821 --> 01:32:40,900
it was like there was me pre working out
and then me,

2080
01:32:41,320 --> 01:32:41,681
it's like,
oh,

2081
01:32:41,681 --> 01:32:44,190
now I can think now.
And then I realized I was a kid.

2082
01:32:44,191 --> 01:32:45,970
I was under the influence of biology for

2083
01:32:46,430 --> 01:32:46,731
well,
yeah,

2084
01:32:46,731 --> 01:32:49,790
I mean you're lucky that you didn't
channel that into drugs or,

2085
01:32:49,960 --> 01:32:52,710
or alcohol or aggression drugs.
Flora question.

2086
01:32:52,740 --> 01:32:53,070
Yeah.

2087
01:32:53,070 --> 01:32:55,420
Yeah.
Violence is the real worry like that.

2088
01:32:56,190 --> 01:33:01,190
That's a giant issue with boys.
And you see kids playing and I was at a

2089
01:33:01,711 --> 01:33:04,230
party recently,
a little kid's party.

2090
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:07,340
It was an adult party.
Children's Patty.

2091
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:09,600
All right.
Little kids.

2092
01:33:09,601 --> 01:33:10,850
Okay.
And uh,

2093
01:33:10,870 --> 01:33:15,870
there was this one boy and this one boy
has these two parents that had kids late

2094
01:33:16,261 --> 01:33:17,400
in life.
And they weren't really paying

2095
01:33:17,401 --> 01:33:19,410
attention.
They were inside drinking and this kid

2096
01:33:19,411 --> 01:33:21,930
was fucking hyper aggressive running
around,

2097
01:33:22,170 --> 01:33:24,720
pushing kids.
He hit kids.

2098
01:33:25,130 --> 01:33:27,570
I've watched him,
I watched him a call,

2099
01:33:27,571 --> 01:33:31,200
this kid a loser and uh,
you know,

2100
01:33:31,260 --> 01:33:34,530
I had to have a conversation with the
dad and I'm like,

2101
01:33:34,531 --> 01:33:36,360
dude,
you're kid is really aggressive.

2102
01:33:36,570 --> 01:33:37,560
And he's like,
he's a good kid.

2103
01:33:37,860 --> 01:33:38,693
I'm like,
yeah,

2104
01:33:38,700 --> 01:33:40,620
I wanted it.
It's so hard because you want to say,

2105
01:33:40,621 --> 01:33:42,690
hey man,
you ain't even fucking watching your

2106
01:33:42,691 --> 01:33:43,920
kid.
You read your drinking.

2107
01:33:44,820 --> 01:33:45,361
I'm like,
look,

2108
01:33:45,361 --> 01:33:47,770
I,
I saw him push his kid and him illusory.

2109
01:33:47,780 --> 01:33:48,960
Like that never happened.
I'm like,

2110
01:33:49,380 --> 01:33:51,180
oh my God.
He goes,

2111
01:33:51,181 --> 01:33:53,370
I look,
I'm trying to apologize cause his kid

2112
01:33:53,371 --> 01:33:55,650
did something cause I'm trying to
apologize for his behavior.

2113
01:33:55,680 --> 01:33:57,060
I'm like,
you're not apologizing.

2114
01:33:57,061 --> 01:33:58,620
You're saying he's,
he didn't do anything.

2115
01:33:58,940 --> 01:33:59,511
I'm like,
all right mate,

2116
01:33:59,511 --> 01:34:00,300
look,
I'm sorry.

2117
01:34:00,300 --> 01:34:02,460
I'm sorry that this is the case,
but this is what happened.

2118
01:34:02,870 --> 01:34:06,080
What is it with parents defending their
kids so much these days?

2119
01:34:06,081 --> 01:34:08,830
If say if a parent had come up to my
parents when I was little kid and told

2120
01:34:08,831 --> 01:34:10,280
them that I'd been doing something like
that,

2121
01:34:10,430 --> 01:34:14,600
it would have been the grownups
gathering together against the child in

2122
01:34:14,601 --> 01:34:16,640
order to kind of communally raise the
child.

2123
01:34:16,641 --> 01:34:16,890
Like,
Hey,

2124
01:34:16,890 --> 01:34:18,740
my dad would not have said that he
didn't do that.

2125
01:34:18,890 --> 01:34:20,990
He will come up to me and said,
did you do that?

2126
01:34:21,240 --> 01:34:24,090
This guy and his wife were both
drinking.

2127
01:34:24,210 --> 01:34:27,600
That could have definitely been a factor
and there was a factor in me not pushing

2128
01:34:27,601 --> 01:34:30,420
it because I didn't want,
because first of all he,

2129
01:34:30,510 --> 01:34:33,630
when a guy says to you,
that didn't happen when you know it

2130
01:34:33,631 --> 01:34:36,300
happened,
did you are two steps away from beating

2131
01:34:36,301 --> 01:34:36,840
the fuck

2132
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:39,500
he wasn't there.
You were there exactly what happened.

2133
01:34:39,501 --> 01:34:42,380
How does he know that it didn't happen?
And it's such a weird thing to say.

2134
01:34:42,410 --> 01:34:44,990
We're two steps away from,
well he wasn't watching this kid at all.

2135
01:34:45,030 --> 01:34:46,010
Yeah.
And His kid.

2136
01:34:46,280 --> 01:34:46,980
First of all,
he,

2137
01:34:46,980 --> 01:34:51,950
they had to go to visit his kid because
this kid hit other kids on three

2138
01:34:51,951 --> 01:34:55,760
occasions and it's funny,
he has really good grounds for believing

2139
01:34:55,761 --> 01:34:57,980
that it never happened.
It's party over

2140
01:34:57,980 --> 01:34:59,120
a course of,
you know,

2141
01:34:59,150 --> 01:35:00,890
this is over a course of a couple of
hours.

2142
01:35:00,891 --> 01:35:05,891
This kid hit three kids and so when you
say to a guy that your kids really

2143
01:35:06,531 --> 01:35:07,161
aggressive,
he's like,

2144
01:35:07,161 --> 01:35:08,120
he's a good kid.
Yeah,

2145
01:35:08,270 --> 01:35:09,290
no he's not.
He's a good kid.

2146
01:35:09,470 --> 01:35:10,430
Oh,
he's a good kid.

2147
01:35:10,590 --> 01:35:14,090
You don't even fucking know.
Maybe he's a good kid who's being

2148
01:35:14,091 --> 01:35:16,430
aggressive right now.
It doesn't change what I saw,

2149
01:35:16,490 --> 01:35:19,430
but what I'm saying is kids,
especially boys,

2150
01:35:19,460 --> 01:35:23,090
they have this thing inside of them.
Some of them do,

2151
01:35:23,091 --> 01:35:25,040
some of them don't.
But you know,

2152
01:35:25,070 --> 01:35:28,700
we very biologically,
but some of them have this aggressive

2153
01:35:28,701 --> 01:35:31,250
tendency.
That's why boys like to play football.

2154
01:35:31,460 --> 01:35:34,940
It's why boys gravitate to,
or some boys gravitate towards

2155
01:35:34,941 --> 01:35:38,090
aggressive activities.
They got to get it out of their system.

2156
01:35:38,270 --> 01:35:40,700
You got to exercise with that kid.
You got to do something with them,

2157
01:35:41,090 --> 01:35:42,860
play catch with them,
run around with them.

2158
01:35:42,980 --> 01:35:46,490
Where I'm out there,
people are not meant to sit down,

2159
01:35:46,670 --> 01:35:50,570
it'll fucking classroom and just pay
attention all day to some shit they

2160
01:35:50,571 --> 01:35:53,720
don't want to pay attention to and then
go home and sit in front of the TV.

2161
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:56,130
And what do they do with all that energy
that they put them on?

2162
01:35:56,131 --> 01:35:59,090
Adrenaline that kept us from,
you know,

2163
01:35:59,690 --> 01:36:01,820
kept us alive,
kept us from predators,

2164
01:36:01,940 --> 01:36:05,840
kept us from invaders mean that all that
stuff is biologically programmed in the

2165
01:36:05,841 --> 01:36:07,940
human animal and we ignore it.

2166
01:36:07,980 --> 01:36:11,100
You're leading very transphobic by
implying that there something male

2167
01:36:11,340 --> 01:36:13,710
intrinsically transphobic or is it
gender?

2168
01:36:13,770 --> 01:36:15,810
I don't know.
Gender Essential Ism.

2169
01:36:15,811 --> 01:36:17,210
I think that's what it's called.
Uh,

2170
01:36:17,220 --> 01:36:18,630
no,
I'm with you and this is a problem.

2171
01:36:18,631 --> 01:36:21,600
I mean this is a problem about the,
about fatherhood,

2172
01:36:21,630 --> 01:36:22,820
right?
It's something I'm thinking about,

2173
01:36:22,850 --> 01:36:24,510
uh,
about now that I'm about to become a

2174
01:36:24,511 --> 01:36:25,081
file.
I'm like,

2175
01:36:25,081 --> 01:36:26,970
how do I run around?
Take care of too.

2176
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,030
Yeah.
And how do I also make sure that like

2177
01:36:29,070 --> 01:36:33,080
they grow up with good masculine role
models and people and then I give that,

2178
01:36:33,081 --> 01:36:37,110
enable them to be the best kinds of
human beings that they want to flourish

2179
01:36:37,111 --> 01:36:38,670
into.
And then you've got the whole question

2180
01:36:38,671 --> 01:36:41,260
of adderall and Ritalin and saw on the
these,

2181
01:36:41,370 --> 01:36:43,980
my neighbor did that.
My neighbor put their kid on Ritalin,

2182
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:44,990
one of them

2183
01:36:44,990 --> 01:36:46,070
Prozac,
Ritalin,

2184
01:36:46,100 --> 01:36:48,620
something like that.
They had this kid and he wasn't a bad

2185
01:36:48,621 --> 01:36:50,720
kid.
He was just fucking ignored.

2186
01:36:50,721 --> 01:36:52,280
The same thing.
The wife,

2187
01:36:52,670 --> 01:36:54,560
the wife was always trying to get dick
from everybody.

2188
01:36:54,561 --> 01:36:57,080
She was like flirting and everybody,
she flirt with my friends,

2189
01:36:57,081 --> 01:37:00,860
flirt with everybody and the husband is
just fucking like dealing with this

2190
01:37:00,861 --> 01:37:02,840
crazy bitch for a wife.
He didn't want to be there.

2191
01:37:03,080 --> 01:37:06,200
He would work late and this poor kid was
just bouncing off the walls.

2192
01:37:06,201 --> 01:37:07,070
It's,
they put them on drugs,

2193
01:37:07,071 --> 01:37:07,440
dogs

2194
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:08,380
as I am.
There's a,

2195
01:37:08,550 --> 01:37:10,840
an economist called Tyler Cowen,
I don't know if you know of,

2196
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:11,870
of Tyler.
He was,

2197
01:37:11,871 --> 01:37:13,160
um,
he would have,

2198
01:37:13,190 --> 01:37:16,910
he's the kind of guy who now that he's
in his mid fifties says that he's sure

2199
01:37:16,911 --> 01:37:19,820
that when he was younger he would have
been medicated if it were,

2200
01:37:20,090 --> 01:37:21,080
you know,
if,

2201
01:37:21,230 --> 01:37:24,560
if he were a young person today and he,
and the point that he was making about

2202
01:37:24,561 --> 01:37:29,561
that was that human psychology is
complicated and there's no sort of Yin

2203
01:37:30,171 --> 01:37:31,310
without the Yang.
Right.

2204
01:37:31,340 --> 01:37:36,340
Like the,
the distractedness that he had was bad

2205
01:37:36,861 --> 01:37:39,800
if what you wanted was for him to sit
still in class and pay attention to

2206
01:37:39,801 --> 01:37:41,340
something that he wasn't interested in.
Yes.

2207
01:37:41,570 --> 01:37:45,890
But fantastic in a whole bunch of other
ways that he thinks were invaluable.

2208
01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:46,753
Yeah.
Right.

2209
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:48,790
Well,
my best friend Sam and Australia,

2210
01:37:48,830 --> 01:37:52,220
who is a brilliant,
like soil scientist,

2211
01:37:52,221 --> 01:37:56,010
one of the countries and possibly the
world's best scientists in his field has

2212
01:37:56,011 --> 01:37:57,050
a phd.
If,

2213
01:37:57,110 --> 01:38:00,270
if we'd been growing up,
if instead of being born when we were

2214
01:38:00,271 --> 01:38:02,790
born,
we'd been born just 10 years later.

2215
01:38:03,240 --> 01:38:05,160
What would his creative,
what would have happened to his

2216
01:38:05,161 --> 01:38:09,300
creativity if he'd been medicated in
order to be able to get through class

2217
01:38:09,301 --> 01:38:10,140
because he was always

2218
01:38:10,610 --> 01:38:12,110
distracted.
Parents don't care.

2219
01:38:12,111 --> 01:38:14,480
They want convenience,
especially parents at work all day.

2220
01:38:14,570 --> 01:38:18,320
They work all day and they come home and
they want this kid to fucking behave

2221
01:38:18,321 --> 01:38:22,070
because they're tired and they want this
life that they see in movies and in

2222
01:38:22,071 --> 01:38:24,050
television shows.
They don't know what it's like to raise

2223
01:38:24,051 --> 01:38:27,650
a human being.
It's very complex and you know,

2224
01:38:27,651 --> 01:38:30,950
especially when you're sending these
fucking kids to schools that they

2225
01:38:30,951 --> 01:38:35,210
promote these rigid ideas of how
children are supposed to behave and you

2226
01:38:35,211 --> 01:38:38,030
know,
and tell you that if you don't follow

2227
01:38:38,031 --> 01:38:39,590
the rules,
you're not going to be successful.

2228
01:38:39,591 --> 01:38:43,580
I mean how many fucking stories have you
heard where teachers tell rowdy kids

2229
01:38:43,581 --> 01:38:44,690
they're never going to amount to
anything.

2230
01:38:45,050 --> 01:38:47,450
I had a teacher tell it to me.
I'll never fucking forget it.

2231
01:38:47,480 --> 01:38:49,340
Yup.
My head that as well cause she was just

2232
01:38:49,341 --> 01:38:51,050
so dumb.
She was so,

2233
01:38:51,080 --> 01:38:53,360
she was so dominant,
such a bad teacher.

2234
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:56,710
And I was a terrible student.
I mean she was certainly frustrated ms

2235
01:38:56,720 --> 01:38:57,710
public schools.
Right.

2236
01:38:58,160 --> 01:38:58,993
But,
uh,

2237
01:38:59,030 --> 01:39:01,430
I said something and she was a black
woman,

2238
01:39:01,431 --> 01:39:03,740
had terrible accent.
She,

2239
01:39:03,741 --> 01:39:06,860
uh,
had a very bad ebonics accent and I was,

2240
01:39:06,861 --> 01:39:09,410
uh,
talking to my friend and she goes,

2241
01:39:09,411 --> 01:39:11,240
Mr Rogan,
would you like to come up here and do

2242
01:39:11,241 --> 01:39:12,950
both of these problems in front of the
class?

2243
01:39:13,130 --> 01:39:15,200
So I go,
would you like me to do both of those

2244
01:39:15,201 --> 01:39:18,160
problems?
And everybody,

2245
01:39:18,500 --> 01:39:21,170
everybody started laughing.
Harla kids were like,

2246
01:39:21,200 --> 01:39:24,080
oh shit.
And so she kicked me out of class for

2247
01:39:24,081 --> 01:39:27,950
that and I said,
all I did was talk the way you talk and

2248
01:39:27,951 --> 01:39:29,060
you kicked me out.
I go,

2249
01:39:29,061 --> 01:39:30,590
just because you're teaching a math
class.

2250
01:39:30,680 --> 01:39:31,760
Shinny,
learned how to talk,

2251
01:39:32,330 --> 01:39:34,970
shitting learned.
I taught correctly for our students and

2252
01:39:34,971 --> 01:39:37,430
she kicked me out and she,
I remember said,

2253
01:39:37,580 --> 01:39:39,050
go ahead,
laugh at Mr Rogan.

2254
01:39:39,050 --> 01:39:41,450
Mr Rogan has never gonna amount to
anything in life.

2255
01:39:41,630 --> 01:39:43,400
Yeah.
Unlike being a public school teacher,

2256
01:39:43,490 --> 01:39:45,230
but I rent,
it's nothing wrong with being a public

2257
01:39:45,231 --> 01:39:46,910
school teacher.
Just saying she didn't amend it very

2258
01:39:46,911 --> 01:39:48,050
much.
It's not true.

2259
01:39:48,051 --> 01:39:51,650
It's a great job if you do it right.
What I'm saying has influence over

2260
01:39:51,651 --> 01:39:53,750
people at school.
Teachers are worthless and should be

2261
01:39:53,751 --> 01:39:56,180
executed.
That's precisely the boy.

2262
01:39:57,060 --> 01:39:58,490
So rude.
First of all,

2263
01:39:58,491 --> 01:40:00,800
you're not even American and come over
and say that shit.

2264
01:40:00,980 --> 01:40:02,330
We have public school teachers.
No,

2265
01:40:02,331 --> 01:40:05,960
of course.
I love that she's saying that it's cause

2266
01:40:05,961 --> 01:40:09,000
she's a cunt.
She was not a nice,

2267
01:40:09,010 --> 01:40:09,630
we should be

2268
01:40:09,630 --> 01:40:12,210
sizing her not for her occupation but
for her constant.

2269
01:40:12,390 --> 01:40:15,260
What's a fucking horrible job man?
I mean I wouldn't want to deal with me

2270
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:18,180
when I was 15 yeah.
Who the hell wants to deal with a 15

2271
01:40:18,181 --> 01:40:20,070
year old boy who doesn't want to pay
attention?

2272
01:40:20,071 --> 01:40:23,790
Who doesn't give a shit about math,
but you know she left a weak spot,

2273
01:40:24,140 --> 01:40:25,100
do you think?
Well,

2274
01:40:25,101 --> 01:40:28,340
it also the whole question of like how
of speaking?

2275
01:40:28,341 --> 01:40:30,620
Well,
as a teacher,

2276
01:40:30,650 --> 01:40:34,430
if you're an educator then you sort of
have to have your shit together.

2277
01:40:34,490 --> 01:40:37,910
In terms of being educated,
but then that also bumps up against,

2278
01:40:37,911 --> 01:40:42,530
are we being racist by implying that
black American English is less educated

2279
01:40:42,770 --> 01:40:46,510
than standard white English?
Cause some people argue that the,

2280
01:40:46,610 --> 01:40:50,450
that black English is just a dialect of
the language.

2281
01:40:50,730 --> 01:40:53,920
Well you could argue that,
but you know what the same would be held

2282
01:40:53,950 --> 01:40:56,380
if this was,
I mean this is in Massachusetts.

2283
01:40:56,590 --> 01:41:00,790
The same will be held if it was a guy
who was a teacher who had a ridiculous

2284
01:41:00,791 --> 01:41:04,000
Boston accent and I've marked his Boston
accent.

2285
01:41:04,360 --> 01:41:05,340
Like if he said,
uh,

2286
01:41:05,341 --> 01:41:07,420
you know something about pack you
fucking cat.

2287
01:41:07,780 --> 01:41:09,910
And I was like,
would you like me to pack my cat

2288
01:41:09,911 --> 01:41:12,250
correctly?
Kicked me out because of that.

2289
01:41:12,251 --> 01:41:13,410
It's the same thing.
A lot of stress.

2290
01:41:14,430 --> 01:41:17,380
They hit him with a bid.
You're mocking someone's inability to

2291
01:41:17,381 --> 01:41:21,250
communicate correctly and it because
look whether or not it's good or bad.

2292
01:41:21,251 --> 01:41:24,340
Like you might like saying both better.
You might like it and there's nothing

2293
01:41:24,341 --> 01:41:25,151
wrong with that.
Look,

2294
01:41:25,151 --> 01:41:26,680
if you're a happy,
successful person,

2295
01:41:26,690 --> 01:41:29,170
you don't like to say both.
You like to say both.

2296
01:41:29,860 --> 01:41:31,120
What the fuck is wrong with that?

2297
01:41:31,120 --> 01:41:32,560
It's just a sound you make with your
mouth.

2298
01:41:32,561 --> 01:41:34,360
Sure.
But if I can say it,

2299
01:41:34,450 --> 01:41:37,240
if I can repeat it and you,
you're so touchy about it.

2300
01:41:37,420 --> 01:41:40,030
You kicked me out of class.
We fucked up.

2301
01:41:40,660 --> 01:41:42,160
You fucked up.
You got a soft spot.

2302
01:41:42,220 --> 01:41:43,420
That's right.
She knows.

2303
01:41:43,421 --> 01:41:44,080
Yeah.
She feels,

2304
01:41:44,080 --> 01:41:45,820
she feels insecure about it.
Exactly.

2305
01:41:45,821 --> 01:41:48,460
How big lab on this one of my first big
laughs,

2306
01:41:48,820 --> 01:41:50,440
I was like,
ah,

2307
01:41:50,441 --> 01:41:52,030
I could mock things.
Yeah.

2308
01:41:52,310 --> 01:41:53,500
But it's just,
you know,

2309
01:41:53,650 --> 01:41:56,080
she just,
she's under pressure.

2310
01:41:56,170 --> 01:41:58,630
It's terrible job not getting paid very
much.

2311
01:41:58,631 --> 01:42:01,600
And you have to be a babysitter as well
as an educator.

2312
01:42:01,650 --> 01:42:02,850
Yeah.
Fucking horrible.

2313
01:42:03,210 --> 01:42:06,110
I mean there's,
I had Frank Rich on my podcast on we,

2314
01:42:06,111 --> 01:42:07,380
the people,
uh,

2315
01:42:07,410 --> 01:42:09,350
who was,
who he's an executive producer on the

2316
01:42:09,351 --> 01:42:11,850
vape and he was the co,
he was,

2317
01:42:11,860 --> 01:42:15,210
we was like the main columnist on the
New York Times opinion page for about 50

2318
01:42:15,211 --> 01:42:20,211
from maybe almost 20 years in the 90s
and the two thousands and he sort of

2319
01:42:20,311 --> 01:42:23,310
started the New York Times.
We can review section,

2320
01:42:23,340 --> 01:42:25,770
which comes out in the Sunday paper.
And these days.

2321
01:42:26,160 --> 01:42:29,730
And he had a piece in New York magazine
which was about how much empathy we

2322
01:42:29,731 --> 01:42:33,420
should feel towards uneducated people.
He was talking specifically about trump,

2323
01:42:33,421 --> 01:42:36,360
about like trump voters because like
since the election there's been quite a

2324
01:42:36,361 --> 01:42:40,830
lot of hand wringing among progressive's
about like we've been focusing too much

2325
01:42:40,831 --> 01:42:44,630
on these issues like trans rights and
gay rights and so on and,

2326
01:42:44,670 --> 01:42:48,390
and identity politics and black lives
matter and we've lost touch with the

2327
01:42:48,391 --> 01:42:50,010
working class base.

2328
01:42:50,010 --> 01:42:54,570
Like the Democratic Party no longer
speaks in a meaningful way to white

2329
01:42:54,600 --> 01:42:57,840
working class,
especially males and especially in rust

2330
01:42:57,841 --> 01:42:59,040
belt cities,
you know,

2331
01:42:59,041 --> 01:42:59,760
in the,
in,

2332
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:04,760
in the Midwest.
And his point was actually fuck him.

2333
01:43:05,670 --> 01:43:07,410
You shouldn't need to pay attention to
them.

2334
01:43:07,720 --> 01:43:10,590
There were a lost cause.
They keep voting against their own

2335
01:43:10,591 --> 01:43:13,260
interest by voting for people like trump
and voting for republicans.

2336
01:43:13,470 --> 01:43:17,160
Don't try to win them over and stop
trying to understand them and wringing

2337
01:43:17,161 --> 01:43:21,000
your hands about why you've lost them.
It's an interesting episode.

2338
01:43:21,001 --> 01:43:23,010
If people want,
I mean obviously I'm grossly

2339
01:43:23,580 --> 01:43:25,590
exaggerating what his actual position
is,

2340
01:43:25,591 --> 01:43:26,520
but you should,
you can.

2341
01:43:27,320 --> 01:43:28,550
I can see it,
listen to the other side.

2342
01:43:28,670 --> 01:43:30,650
I could see how someone would take that
stance,

2343
01:43:30,920 --> 01:43:33,830
but I think there's just a natural
inclination to go left and right with

2344
01:43:33,831 --> 01:43:36,590
people.
There's a natural inclination to react

2345
01:43:36,591 --> 01:43:41,060
to certain right leaning behaviors by
going far left and the natural

2346
01:43:41,061 --> 01:43:46,010
inclination to go like,
like how many people grow up from really

2347
01:43:46,100 --> 01:43:51,100
a regressive religious backgrounds and
then they become like really saccular.

2348
01:43:51,290 --> 01:43:53,470
As they get older,
they abandoned the religion,

2349
01:43:53,480 --> 01:43:55,820
they become reformed Catholics.
It's really common.

2350
01:43:56,300 --> 01:44:01,300
It's really common to to see the
suppression of one ideology and bounce

2351
01:44:01,760 --> 01:44:03,470
in the other direction.
If you have a parent,

2352
01:44:03,680 --> 01:44:05,450
I mean there's a lot of people that,
you know,

2353
01:44:05,451 --> 01:44:07,920
they grow up and their parents are super
hippies and then they become a

2354
01:44:07,921 --> 01:44:10,130
conservative going to rebel against
their parents.

2355
01:44:10,310 --> 01:44:11,420
It's a really common,
Yup.

2356
01:44:11,740 --> 01:44:14,440
That's what I'm always thinking about in
terms of parenthood as well.

2357
01:44:14,441 --> 01:44:18,070
Like no matter what it is that I try to
fix in the way that my parents raised

2358
01:44:18,071 --> 01:44:19,240
me,
where I think they could've done it

2359
01:44:19,241 --> 01:44:20,830
better.
That's just going to swing in the

2360
01:44:20,831 --> 01:44:22,820
opposite direction and then my kids are
going to do the opposite

2361
01:44:22,870 --> 01:44:25,000
because they,
because you always think that your

2362
01:44:25,001 --> 01:44:27,000
parents did an imperfect job,
right?

2363
01:44:27,640 --> 01:44:30,100
Fighting yesterday's [inaudible] does an
imperfect job.

2364
01:44:30,101 --> 01:44:32,560
It's impossible to be perfect.
You're a fucking human being.

2365
01:44:32,561 --> 01:44:34,990
There's no perfect human beings.
They've never existed.

2366
01:44:35,020 --> 01:44:38,410
Jesus said the sweet baby Jesus,
the Dalai Lama's not perfect.

2367
01:44:38,411 --> 01:44:41,680
How about fucking Gandhi?
Gandhi used to sleep with a bunch of

2368
01:44:41,681 --> 01:44:44,560
girls naked in his room.
He was probably a freak,

2369
01:44:44,920 --> 01:44:47,380
like Gandhi was most likely a freak and
he just,

2370
01:44:47,381 --> 01:44:49,840
they just kept it under wraps because he
was Gandhi like,

2371
01:44:49,841 --> 01:44:51,880
do you know the story?
Used to sleep with naked teenagers.

2372
01:44:51,910 --> 01:44:54,250
Yeah.
There's also weird things about,

2373
01:44:54,280 --> 01:44:58,060
I mean human and also Mother Teresa have
weird things in their personal lives do

2374
01:44:58,600 --> 01:44:59,830
well.
I don't think it was sexual,

2375
01:44:59,831 --> 01:45:02,040
but I think there was a lot,
there were a lot of questions about like

2376
01:45:02,050 --> 01:45:05,320
her ethical dealings in terms of the
Mother Teresa Foundation and where her

2377
01:45:05,321 --> 01:45:08,590
money went.
And like what did it go too well for his

2378
01:45:08,591 --> 01:45:10,270
thought.
She didn't think that it was very,

2379
01:45:10,340 --> 01:45:14,050
she didn't think it was a good idea to
empower young women.

2380
01:45:14,280 --> 01:45:16,440
What have you.
W We found out that all our money went

2381
01:45:16,441 --> 01:45:20,580
to a warehouse filled with dildos.
Why thought fuck.

2382
01:45:20,790 --> 01:45:23,990
Like she did a lot of good but she also
bought a lot of Dildos,

2383
01:45:24,330 --> 01:45:27,540
fucking gigantic stacks of,
oh wait,

2384
01:45:28,170 --> 01:45:33,170
she could use the door kick start these
fucking Harley Davidson powered

2385
01:45:33,901 --> 01:45:35,760
vibrators.
I love it.

2386
01:45:36,330 --> 01:45:39,440
Uh Yeah.
Well I mean the people are not perfect

2387
01:45:39,441 --> 01:45:43,950
and most charitable organizations are
criticized for spending far too much on

2388
01:45:44,340 --> 01:45:47,940
infrastructure and you know,
the administrative costs and then you

2389
01:45:47,941 --> 01:45:49,740
find out how much money actually goes to
the charity.

2390
01:45:49,741 --> 01:45:53,760
Like you just have an organization where
you're giving people jobs and by the way

2391
01:45:53,761 --> 01:45:55,230
you also do some good.

2392
01:45:55,640 --> 01:45:56,473
Awesome.
Good.

2393
01:45:56,780 --> 01:45:58,940
It's interesting cause like whenever I
give to charity,

2394
01:45:58,941 --> 01:46:00,560
I always try to pay attention to how
many,

2395
01:46:00,561 --> 01:46:03,770
how many overheads they have and how
much money is being spent on Admin and

2396
01:46:03,771 --> 01:46:06,770
so on.
But then it was actually I think will

2397
01:46:06,771 --> 01:46:09,410
macaskill or someone who's involved in
the um,

2398
01:46:09,650 --> 01:46:12,230
like the,
the life you can save kind of like give

2399
01:46:12,240 --> 01:46:14,660
well movement,
which is like rational.

2400
01:46:14,740 --> 01:46:18,230
Is it practical altruism or rational
altruism with effective altruism?

2401
01:46:18,231 --> 01:46:19,200
That's how podcasts,
yeah.

2402
01:46:19,970 --> 01:46:20,803
Yeah,
he's great.

2403
01:46:21,170 --> 01:46:24,380
He was an,
and they were saying in actual fact it

2404
01:46:24,381 --> 01:46:28,310
does take quite a lot of administration
to make a dollar work.

2405
01:46:28,311 --> 01:46:31,520
Well of course.
So if you just look at the ones at the

2406
01:46:31,550 --> 01:46:34,760
charities with the lowest overhead,
then that it doesn't necessarily

2407
01:46:34,761 --> 01:46:37,220
actually mean that they're doing the
best work in the field because it might

2408
01:46:37,221 --> 01:46:40,430
cost 40 cents out of every dollar to
make sure that you're targeting the

2409
01:46:40,431 --> 01:46:44,700
remaining 60 cents in a way where you'll
get actually 60 cents of value rather

2410
01:46:44,710 --> 01:46:46,820
than a place that only has a 15%
overhead.

2411
01:46:47,060 --> 01:46:50,190
But then the remaining 85 cents are all
being on bullshit projects

2412
01:46:50,190 --> 01:46:52,480
that don't have any measurable.
And then success.

2413
01:46:52,481 --> 01:46:54,480
It's signed the complete other end of
the spectrum.

2414
01:46:54,481 --> 01:46:57,420
You have the Clinton Foundation,
which was a ruse.

2415
01:46:58,170 --> 01:47:00,630
I mean,
it was not essentially a prestige play

2416
01:47:00,631 --> 01:47:02,040
wasn't,
it doesn't exist anymore.

2417
01:47:02,670 --> 01:47:04,530
Does not exist any going under.
Yeah,

2418
01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:06,030
they're closing it down.
Hmm.

2419
01:47:06,060 --> 01:47:07,890
Isn't that a fact?
Pull up police pull that up.

2420
01:47:07,980 --> 01:47:09,780
I'm pretty sure they,
they said they were shutting it down,

2421
01:47:10,200 --> 01:47:15,200
but I mean Bill Clinton would take
hundreds of thousands of dollars and

2422
01:47:15,451 --> 01:47:18,050
speak at these charitable events.
Like people would jet,

2423
01:47:18,060 --> 01:47:21,840
they would spend a gigantic chunk of
their budget to have Bill Clinton come

2424
01:47:21,841 --> 01:47:24,690
and speak and he would take all of it.
He would take all the money.

2425
01:47:24,691 --> 01:47:26,740
He wouldn't,
we didn't think of it fast.

2426
01:47:26,950 --> 01:47:28,320
Yeah.
So he would,

2427
01:47:28,500 --> 01:47:33,500
he would take these gigantic donations
from people and then he would speak and

2428
01:47:34,770 --> 01:47:38,580
get paid hundreds of thousand dollars
speaking phase of crazy.

2429
01:47:38,581 --> 01:47:40,230
I mean,
even the fact that Hillary Clinton was

2430
01:47:40,231 --> 01:47:45,000
taking speaking fees from Goldman Sachs
and did not think that that would look

2431
01:47:45,001 --> 01:47:47,660
bad in,
she didn't give a fuck.

2432
01:47:47,660 --> 01:47:48,510
So stupid.
No,

2433
01:47:48,511 --> 01:47:48,751
I,
well,

2434
01:47:48,751 --> 01:47:50,520
I think now she gives a fuck.
Well,

2435
01:47:50,521 --> 01:47:53,160
you know what?
Bernie Sanders drilled that and I'm so

2436
01:47:53,161 --> 01:47:55,560
glad he did.
But look,

2437
01:47:56,310 --> 01:47:58,530
it's bribery.
It's a loophole.

2438
01:47:58,680 --> 01:48:01,890
There's a little bowl and it's bribery.
Nobody wants to pay to hear her talk.

2439
01:48:01,891 --> 01:48:03,780
Get the fuck out of here.
She's a terrible speaker.

2440
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:07,050
She's not Louis C k.
You know what I'm saying?

2441
01:48:07,280 --> 01:48:08,430
I mean,
this is not Chris Rock.

2442
01:48:08,431 --> 01:48:10,890
We're talking about this is,
she's not a good speaker,

2443
01:48:10,910 --> 01:48:13,910
but the whole painted here,
this is the whole thing about these I,

2444
01:48:13,911 --> 01:48:17,520
late Clinton global initiative to
shutdown lays off 22 as donations,

2445
01:48:17,760 --> 01:48:19,400
but this is the Washington Times.
That's a,

2446
01:48:19,410 --> 01:48:20,590
that's a no,
no,

2447
01:48:20,591 --> 01:48:21,620
no.
Right wing rag.

2448
01:48:21,621 --> 01:48:23,100
How dare you check.
Um,

2449
01:48:23,220 --> 01:48:25,560
that's,
that's not the only place that I saw it.

2450
01:48:25,590 --> 01:48:28,030
I saw it in a lot of places.
They're shutting it down at the top.

2451
01:48:28,060 --> 01:48:30,460
The top click is snipes.
So that'll tell level.

2452
01:48:30,510 --> 01:48:34,200
That's the conspiracy theory of the
whole story about snopes though.

2453
01:48:34,260 --> 01:48:35,910
Do you know about the guy who runs
snopes?

2454
01:48:37,620 --> 01:48:40,500
Snopes is run by a fucking Kook.
The Guy,

2455
01:48:40,530 --> 01:48:43,800
the guy who runs snopes left his wife,
he started with his wife,

2456
01:48:43,801 --> 01:48:45,630
left his wife,
married a prostitute,

2457
01:48:46,070 --> 01:48:49,680
a prostitute as a website where she was
as recently as two years ago,

2458
01:48:49,681 --> 01:48:52,020
was getting reviewed for her prostitute
work.

2459
01:48:52,320 --> 01:48:57,320
She's asked court and there they both
have a clear left wing bias clear like,

2460
01:48:57,840 --> 01:48:59,850
like he's,
she's been involved in,

2461
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:00,833
well,
I mean show me,

2462
01:49:02,730 --> 01:49:05,430
show me any snips,
pages that say that something is true

2463
01:49:05,431 --> 01:49:10,110
when it's not or the sites.
Not necessarily that it's true or it's

2464
01:49:10,111 --> 01:49:13,770
false.
There's these ambiguous areas where they

2465
01:49:13,771 --> 01:49:16,890
always lean left and that's what people
have said about snopes.

2466
01:49:16,891 --> 01:49:17,724
It's kind of tricky.

2467
01:49:17,750 --> 01:49:18,930
Okay,
but it's not,

2468
01:49:18,931 --> 01:49:19,651
it's,
it's simple.

2469
01:49:19,651 --> 01:49:24,651
It's not like this computer controlled
objective reality and understand Isley.

2470
01:49:25,570 --> 01:49:28,560
Politifact is also,
it also gets accused of being left wing

2471
01:49:28,561 --> 01:49:31,590
because right wing people who are full
of shit don't like being cold out on it.

2472
01:49:31,620 --> 01:49:32,670
Fake News.
Yeah,

2473
01:49:32,700 --> 01:49:33,361
exactly.
It's not,

2474
01:49:33,361 --> 01:49:34,760
it's not actually,
I mean I've,

2475
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:36,610
I haven't seen anything on snips that is
uh,

2476
01:49:36,660 --> 01:49:38,680
that is questionable.
Even if the guy's an asshole,

2477
01:49:39,040 --> 01:49:42,240
this CNN thing,
when she pointed to the CNN reporter,

2478
01:49:42,241 --> 01:49:44,570
you are fake news.
Oh well this is,

2479
01:49:44,670 --> 01:49:48,010
this is that me of living in a

2480
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:51,710
banana republic reminded me of living
under in Venezuela.

2481
01:49:52,210 --> 01:49:53,230
Fake News.
Yeah,

2482
01:49:53,380 --> 01:49:56,170
you are faking like just that statement.
What the fuck does that even mean?

2483
01:49:56,680 --> 01:50:00,340
You're not news.
This is a goddamn person to you in vain.

2484
01:50:00,370 --> 01:50:02,950
You are fake news.
Fake news also,

2485
01:50:04,240 --> 01:50:06,360
but so effective people loved it when
you're,

2486
01:50:06,470 --> 01:50:08,020
you know,
the thug life meme,

2487
01:50:08,420 --> 01:50:11,680
the sunglasses chopped down.
I saw that a bunch of those for him when

2488
01:50:11,681 --> 01:50:16,681
he said that you are fake news.
I mean did you guys were in the states

2489
01:50:16,871 --> 01:50:20,190
when you were like kids we like,
did you have like I know you why you

2490
01:50:20,191 --> 01:50:22,480
said you are,
but what am I like that kind of

2491
01:50:22,481 --> 01:50:26,050
bullshit.
Basically what he's saying like people

2492
01:50:26,051 --> 01:50:27,570
accuse,
no,

2493
01:50:27,580 --> 01:50:30,640
you like he was elected on the,
on the back.

2494
01:50:30,700 --> 01:50:34,210
He would be elected by very,
very narrow majorities in a few key

2495
01:50:34,211 --> 01:50:39,010
swing states that had been inundated
with bullshit stories on facebook that

2496
01:50:39,011 --> 01:50:44,011
were coming out of eastern Europe with
Russian funding and expand,

2497
01:50:44,380 --> 01:50:47,040
exploding all of these fake bombshell
expos.

2498
01:50:47,041 --> 01:50:51,550
A's is about how Hillary Clinton,
how the FBI prosecutor who was looking

2499
01:50:51,551 --> 01:50:54,820
into Hillary Clinton had been found dead
and all this sort of stuff.

2500
01:50:54,821 --> 01:50:58,600
There was actually fake news then the
way the term came into public public

2501
01:50:58,601 --> 01:51:02,980
consciousness last year.
And now anyone who criticizes the

2502
01:51:02,981 --> 01:51:05,230
administration,
he just does.

2503
01:51:05,231 --> 01:51:06,640
He just pulls a,
I know you are,

2504
01:51:06,641 --> 01:51:08,620
you said you are,
but what am I a trick and says,

2505
01:51:08,621 --> 01:51:09,970
Whoa,
that's not fake news.

2506
01:51:09,971 --> 01:51:12,400
Your fake news you face is fake news.

2507
01:51:15,210 --> 01:51:18,230
What did you think about when Julian
assange,

2508
01:51:18,530 --> 01:51:22,440
um,
implied that that young man who worked

2509
01:51:22,441 --> 01:51:24,540
for the DNC,
who was assassinated,

2510
01:51:25,010 --> 01:51:27,750
he was shot in the back.
They tried to say it was a robbery.

2511
01:51:27,780 --> 01:51:30,160
Like they left his wallet,
they left his watch,

2512
01:51:30,161 --> 01:51:31,860
they left his phone,
they'd left all his money.

2513
01:51:32,200 --> 01:51:34,230
That didn't take a thing from him and
they shot him at four o'clock in the

2514
01:51:34,231 --> 01:51:37,470
morning in the back.
Julian assange was insinuating that this

2515
01:51:37,471 --> 01:51:41,730
young man had been the source of the DNC
leaks.

2516
01:51:41,880 --> 01:51:45,120
That implied that though,
that show that Hillary Clinton and the

2517
01:51:45,121 --> 01:51:48,090
DNC conspired against Bernie Sanders in
the primary,

2518
01:51:48,630 --> 01:51:50,670
and you don't really hear about that
anymore.

2519
01:51:50,671 --> 01:51:51,690
I mean,
that guy's dead.

2520
01:51:51,750 --> 01:51:53,880
He's dead and there's no investigation.
There's no,

2521
01:51:53,910 --> 01:51:56,370
no one was found guilty.
No one was tried.

2522
01:51:56,371 --> 01:51:57,480
There's no,
there's no,

2523
01:51:57,510 --> 01:51:59,250
no one's looking.
That guy was killed.

2524
01:51:59,420 --> 01:52:00,440
Well,
I'd like to look into it.

2525
01:52:00,441 --> 01:52:04,220
I think [inaudible] has kind of lost
credibility by essentially becoming a

2526
01:52:04,221 --> 01:52:07,880
conduit for the Kremlin.
Like all of know wikileaks,

2527
01:52:08,030 --> 01:52:10,540
we all know that the,
I mean people insecurity.

2528
01:52:10,550 --> 01:52:12,170
So every,
anytime I talk about this,

2529
01:52:12,171 --> 01:52:13,760
people are going to respond and say,
Oh,

2530
01:52:13,761 --> 01:52:15,330
you're just buying the security
services.

2531
01:52:15,340 --> 01:52:18,260
Align years believing what the NSA and
the CIA want you to believe.

2532
01:52:18,800 --> 01:52:19,610
Okay.
Yeah.

2533
01:52:19,610 --> 01:52:24,610
I'm basically taking on faith the
conclusions of security agencies here in

2534
01:52:24,621 --> 01:52:27,170
the United States,
multiple to get more than a dozen

2535
01:52:27,171 --> 01:52:30,530
different security agencies also
confirmed by the Brits,

2536
01:52:30,531 --> 01:52:33,800
by British,
the British secret service all believe

2537
01:52:33,890 --> 01:52:37,640
say that they have good reason to
believe that the Kremlin was behind the

2538
01:52:37,641 --> 01:52:42,020
hacks and that wikileaks released was,
it must've been in cahoots with the

2539
01:52:42,021 --> 01:52:45,330
Kremlin because otherwise how it,
how did they release the DNC was there

2540
01:52:45,331 --> 01:52:46,010
could have been

2541
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:50,910
many people that were trying to have,
but dealing with like can see

2542
01:52:50,911 --> 01:52:53,240
fingerprints on things.
They know how these things work.

2543
01:52:53,241 --> 01:52:56,270
They can see the back doors.
So do you think that Julian assange was

2544
01:52:56,271 --> 01:52:58,490
lying and saying that guy was a part of
the leaks?

2545
01:52:59,630 --> 01:53:01,490
I think could have been one of the
conduits.

2546
01:53:01,540 --> 01:53:02,840
I mean,
he could have been one of the people

2547
01:53:02,841 --> 01:53:04,880
that leaked it to Russia in the first
place.

2548
01:53:05,950 --> 01:53:07,010
Uh,
that's possible.

2549
01:53:07,160 --> 01:53:08,210
Yeah,
that's possible.

2550
01:53:08,300 --> 01:53:11,330
I just don't know why I would be
trusting Julian assange about any of

2551
01:53:11,331 --> 01:53:13,010
this because he says that it didn't come
from Russia.

2552
01:53:13,400 --> 01:53:14,990
Well,
the other thing that I would worry about

2553
01:53:14,991 --> 01:53:18,350
with Julian Assan,
she's at this poor fuck has been trapped

2554
01:53:18,351 --> 01:53:22,370
in the embassy in London for so long and
he can't get out.

2555
01:53:22,550 --> 01:53:24,230
I think his head is,
I think he'd be,

2556
01:53:24,240 --> 01:53:25,800
he's got a problem with his head these
days.

2557
01:53:26,330 --> 01:53:30,650
How could he not Pammie's back?
Pamela Anderson makes us sixth visit to

2558
01:53:30,651 --> 01:53:35,651
Lover Julian assange as she brings Vegan
cheeseburgers to the Ecuadorian embassy

2559
01:53:36,290 --> 01:53:40,050
for the wikileaks foundation.
What Pamela Anderson is banging Giulia

2560
01:53:40,060 --> 01:53:41,030
massage.
Odd,

2561
01:53:41,060 --> 01:53:43,010
powerful Julian massage.
Wait a minute,

2562
01:53:43,011 --> 01:53:44,930
hold on a second.
Julien is trying to free the world.

2563
01:53:44,931 --> 01:53:47,840
I love him for this.
Pamela Anderson reveals her feelings for

2564
01:53:47,841 --> 01:53:52,010
a sausage in rambling blogs on sex and
faking orgasms.

2565
01:53:52,880 --> 01:53:57,050
Baywatch actress and model 49 is said to
have been dating wikileaks founder has

2566
01:53:57,051 --> 01:53:59,930
been stuck inside.
He's been stuck inside the embassy in

2567
01:53:59,970 --> 01:54:03,810
Knightsbridge since 2012 with saunders
had been stuck inside

2568
01:54:06,120 --> 01:54:08,780
posters too big for him to get stuck.
And I'm saying,

2569
01:54:09,380 --> 01:54:13,370
well I guess he's done well for himself
for a Pale pasty Australian who's never,

2570
01:54:13,460 --> 01:54:14,540
um,
would you just say,

2571
01:54:14,541 --> 01:54:15,830
Jamie,
she's been visiting him there and

2572
01:54:15,840 --> 01:54:17,420
whatnot.
For how long?

2573
01:54:17,530 --> 01:54:18,860
I last couple of months at least.

2574
01:54:18,890 --> 01:54:21,340
She's like a pretty good when you cover
up and put her all in black,

2575
01:54:22,280 --> 01:54:25,010
how old would pedal or Anderson Beta 49
we just read it.

2576
01:54:26,370 --> 01:54:27,230
Oh,
I see.

2577
01:54:27,350 --> 01:54:30,590
Okay.
He's 45 she's 49 she's an older woman.

2578
01:54:31,130 --> 01:54:34,260
Dark and holder and comes around.
Doesn't that like a fuck?

2579
01:54:34,261 --> 01:54:36,470
Yeah,
I mean time wins and all of us.

2580
01:54:36,510 --> 01:54:37,970
Yeah.
I looked like shit compared to when I

2581
01:54:37,971 --> 01:54:40,520
was 25 there's nothing you can do about
everyone does.

2582
01:54:40,521 --> 01:54:42,890
Nothing you can do about it.
It just beats you directly.

2583
01:54:42,920 --> 01:54:45,350
We'll get to a point with science can
reverse that.

2584
01:54:45,410 --> 01:54:47,420
It's on the way 100%.
They've already done it.

2585
01:54:47,470 --> 01:54:51,230
And what people would pay to be able to
look and feel like they did when they

2586
01:54:51,231 --> 01:54:53,440
were 25 well,
you know that Peter Teal guys are

2587
01:54:53,441 --> 01:54:55,820
already getting done blood put into a
system.

2588
01:54:55,900 --> 01:54:57,080
He said,
I don't trust the guy.

2589
01:54:57,081 --> 01:54:59,990
Him and Julie and a son should,
should meet up and create some little

2590
01:54:59,991 --> 01:55:01,550
underground implants and trust him.

2591
01:55:01,970 --> 01:55:04,430
He's selling something fishy about him.
He's a big trump guy,

2592
01:55:04,850 --> 01:55:06,830
which in itself in and of itself is not
bad,

2593
01:55:06,831 --> 01:55:09,530
but he's such,
he's a very smart billionaire.

2594
01:55:09,531 --> 01:55:11,450
Trump guy.
Billionaire gay trump guy.

2595
01:55:11,480 --> 01:55:12,560
Yeah.
Weird.

2596
01:55:12,590 --> 01:55:14,000
And also that whole,
you know,

2597
01:55:14,001 --> 01:55:17,330
suing Golkar until it went under.
Well he's very,

2598
01:55:17,331 --> 01:55:21,080
he's a violative prick.
Well they had a common,

2599
01:55:21,110 --> 01:55:24,530
I mean they outdid him and then they
went after Hulk Hogan and then the guy

2600
01:55:24,531 --> 01:55:27,890
said that he would release a sex tape of
a child,

2601
01:55:28,220 --> 01:55:29,600
you know,
if he could get away with it.

2602
01:55:29,610 --> 01:55:30,650
You remember that?
Yeah,

2603
01:55:30,651 --> 01:55:31,484
I do.
And I,

2604
01:55:31,690 --> 01:55:34,550
it doesn't condone them,
but I don't like setting up a precedent

2605
01:55:34,551 --> 01:55:36,050
where very,
very rich people can just,

2606
01:55:36,051 --> 01:55:38,390
cause this wasn't the only thing that he
was suing them about.

2607
01:55:38,391 --> 01:55:40,740
He was basically just throwing lawsuits
at them that,

2608
01:55:40,741 --> 01:55:42,680
that so,
so fast that they couldn't keep their

2609
01:55:42,681 --> 01:55:43,910
head above and

2610
01:55:44,120 --> 01:55:45,600
they went down to our biggest,
I mean,

2611
01:55:45,601 --> 01:55:48,450
how can you eventually the person's
going to win a lawsuit.

2612
01:55:48,451 --> 01:55:52,140
I don't like the idea that media
companies can just be constantly sued.

2613
01:55:52,170 --> 01:55:54,450
They went after a creep.
I mean,

2614
01:55:54,540 --> 01:55:56,580
well,
they were creeps and they went after

2615
01:55:56,581 --> 01:55:57,870
him,
but they went after a rich guy.

2616
01:55:58,290 --> 01:55:58,761
Yeah.
Well,

2617
01:55:58,761 --> 01:56:00,120
we live in,
we live in America,

2618
01:56:00,121 --> 01:56:02,370
which has a first amendment.
They're supposed to be able to do that

2619
01:56:02,371 --> 01:56:03,750
without,
without being sunk.

2620
01:56:04,230 --> 01:56:08,340
But should they be able to reveal
details about his life that he doesn't

2621
01:56:08,341 --> 01:56:10,440
want public?
Let's let the First Amendment is,

2622
01:56:10,441 --> 01:56:13,500
you're allowed to a set of first
amendment that you're allowed to go

2623
01:56:13,501 --> 01:56:15,810
after.
Someone like say if somebody decides to

2624
01:56:15,811 --> 01:56:18,360
just go after you,
you're not even a public person.

2625
01:56:18,650 --> 01:56:20,610
Like keep me.
Is he probably as a public person,

2626
01:56:20,640 --> 01:56:22,350
how has he public,
because people know who he is.

2627
01:56:22,950 --> 01:56:24,570
I don't actually know whether that was
part of the,

2628
01:56:24,571 --> 01:56:27,720
um,
part of the defense is crazy shit about

2629
01:56:27,721 --> 01:56:29,160
you,
unfortunately.

2630
01:56:29,161 --> 01:56:31,680
Yes.
Because that's what freedom is.

2631
01:56:31,681 --> 01:56:33,000
Like.
I don't think that,

2632
01:56:33,120 --> 01:56:36,510
do you think that America would be a
better place if fantastically wealthy

2633
01:56:36,511 --> 01:56:38,170
people could,
uh,

2634
01:56:38,280 --> 01:56:42,960
launch an endless string of lawsuits?
Whether or not they're legitimate at

2635
01:56:42,961 --> 01:56:45,720
media companies that aren't like,
it's a good question.

2636
01:56:46,080 --> 01:56:50,460
It really depends on what that media
company did and why they did it.

2637
01:56:51,120 --> 01:56:53,940
I mean,
I'm no fan of gawkers tawdry like I

2638
01:56:53,941 --> 01:56:55,720
didn't consume any of that stuff.
I don't know.

2639
01:56:55,721 --> 01:56:59,940
I didn't believe in adding paypal.
I don't think that they were right.

2640
01:56:59,941 --> 01:57:04,590
But what it says about his character is
what I find troubling it much like

2641
01:57:04,591 --> 01:57:05,311
trump.
I just don't,

2642
01:57:05,311 --> 01:57:09,090
I basically don't like vindictive people
who the moment you cross them,

2643
01:57:09,091 --> 01:57:13,560
they then spend the rest of their lives
and fortune like coming back to hunt you

2644
01:57:13,561 --> 01:57:13,860
down.

2645
01:57:13,860 --> 01:57:15,660
I don't think that's a mature character
trait.

2646
01:57:15,750 --> 01:57:17,820
I see your point.
I see your point.

2647
01:57:18,120 --> 01:57:21,600
Um,
the question would be what if they cost

2648
01:57:21,601 --> 01:57:26,210
him money and they profited from it
financially and then he will not leave.

2649
01:57:26,500 --> 01:57:28,080
Cry me a fucking Ribeye.
He comes,

2650
01:57:28,081 --> 01:57:31,650
not the best example.
It's not the best example because you

2651
01:57:31,651 --> 01:57:32,960
know,
there's nothing wrong with being gay.

2652
01:57:32,961 --> 01:57:34,230
She had just been out in the first
place.

2653
01:57:34,250 --> 01:57:35,700
Right.
But that's his choice,

2654
01:57:35,701 --> 01:57:36,960
isn't it?
Yeah,

2655
01:57:36,961 --> 01:57:38,760
it is his choice.
And I don't really believe in adding

2656
01:57:38,761 --> 01:57:39,990
paypal,
but on the other hand,

2657
01:57:39,991 --> 01:57:43,380
like just grow up.
Like I shoot them over that and he just

2658
01:57:43,381 --> 01:57:45,930
decided that they were constant who's
got to go out and get sued them about

2659
01:57:45,931 --> 01:57:46,890
that.
But that didn't work.

2660
01:57:46,891 --> 01:57:49,800
And then he sued him about,
he sued them on multiple occasions.

2661
01:57:49,801 --> 01:57:52,440
If you've got infinitely deep pockets
you can ruin,

2662
01:57:52,470 --> 01:57:55,830
you will find a way to ruin people by
dragging them through the quotes.

2663
01:57:56,640 --> 01:58:00,510
She should have been able to bank roll
hall Cogan did you think Hulk Hogan had

2664
01:58:00,511 --> 01:58:03,030
a legitimate gripe?
Yeah,

2665
01:58:03,031 --> 01:58:04,110
I think so.
Right.

2666
01:58:04,140 --> 01:58:06,180
I mean cause wasn't,
wasn't that the case that he didn't

2667
01:58:06,181 --> 01:58:08,250
realize that he was being 100% of the
time.

2668
01:58:08,580 --> 01:58:10,350
Yeah.
You shouldn't be able to have a video of

2669
01:58:10,351 --> 01:58:13,800
you having sex with somebody that you
didn't know it was being taken splashed

2670
01:58:13,801 --> 01:58:15,170
all over the Internet.
Yeah.

2671
01:58:15,180 --> 01:58:17,100
And then profit from it and then profit
from it.

2672
01:58:17,220 --> 01:58:20,490
So the real question was should he have
been able to bankroll exactly.

2673
01:58:20,670 --> 01:58:21,630
That's right.
Yeah.

2674
01:58:21,660 --> 01:58:26,570
Or or or should they be some limit to
the number of like lawsuits because

2675
01:58:26,580 --> 01:58:27,810
again,
you would want people to be able to

2676
01:58:27,811 --> 01:58:32,070
bankroll cases that they care about
deeply but maybe not three or four

2677
01:58:32,071 --> 01:58:35,580
completely unrelated cases all against
the same side.

2678
01:58:35,581 --> 01:58:36,810
Right.
That's where it gets weird.

2679
01:58:36,811 --> 01:58:39,990
But isn't this the like life in general?
Yeah,

2680
01:58:40,020 --> 01:58:41,160
it's slippery.
Yeah.

2681
01:58:41,200 --> 01:58:42,070
There's,
there's,

2682
01:58:42,070 --> 01:58:43,660
I mean it's like we were talking about
with abortion,

2683
01:58:43,870 --> 01:58:46,630
like what is it?
Is it killing a baby or is it a medical

2684
01:58:46,631 --> 01:58:49,630
procedure?
Just agree that it's both that like

2685
01:58:49,631 --> 01:58:51,820
that.
Not to send why there is,

2686
01:58:52,030 --> 01:58:54,280
especially in this country,
like it's so,

2687
01:58:54,880 --> 01:58:59,880
so polarizing here.
Oh come on man.

2688
01:59:00,070 --> 01:59:04,360
I ain't know Dawson Dawkins and tweeted
something about it that there was

2689
01:59:04,361 --> 01:59:09,361
nothing that people like a human embryo
was a essentially the same thing as a

2690
01:59:10,271 --> 01:59:14,180
pig embryo was like ridiculous
comparison to abortion looks like

2691
01:59:14,310 --> 01:59:18,100
because the religious right.
We'll always be crazy about the things

2692
01:59:18,101 --> 01:59:22,510
that it's crazy about and people will
always get offended on twitter when

2693
01:59:22,511 --> 01:59:24,610
Richard Dawkins tweet something that's
unpopular.

2694
01:59:24,640 --> 01:59:27,160
By the way,
I have an interview with him coming up.

2695
01:59:27,180 --> 01:59:28,300
If,
if so if you don't,

2696
01:59:28,360 --> 01:59:30,480
let me just plug,
if you don't subscribe to way that

2697
01:59:30,490 --> 01:59:34,270
people live in search for we the people,
all one word in your podcast App,

2698
01:59:34,600 --> 01:59:36,940
uh,
I'll be talking to Sam Harris tomorrow,

2699
01:59:36,941 --> 01:59:38,230
which I'll get released in a couple of
weeks.

2700
01:59:38,230 --> 01:59:40,990
And don't shout at me for not releasing
it immediately like you did last time

2701
01:59:40,991 --> 01:59:44,050
twitter and we'll have some not to shout
and we'll have some good and that's

2702
01:59:44,560 --> 01:59:46,330
exactly right.
It's true.

2703
01:59:46,331 --> 01:59:48,340
I'm going to sue their asses and then
drag him through course.

2704
01:59:48,670 --> 01:59:50,560
Uh,
and I'll be talking to joe about the be

2705
01:59:50,561 --> 01:59:51,520
doing,
launching a little,

2706
01:59:51,521 --> 01:59:53,650
um,
ask me anything kind of dominates.

2707
01:59:53,940 --> 01:59:56,780
And so I had,
I did an [inaudible] with Dawkins had a

2708
01:59:56,790 --> 01:59:57,490
stroke,
stroke.

2709
01:59:57,490 --> 01:59:58,600
He's great,
he's fine,

2710
01:59:58,601 --> 01:59:59,560
he's doing well.
Well,

2711
01:59:59,561 --> 02:00:03,100
the stroke did not affect his,
his cognitive function.

2712
02:00:03,250 --> 02:00:05,560
It did affect his ability to sing,
which is interesting.

2713
02:00:05,590 --> 02:00:06,460
Oh,
that's interesting.

2714
02:00:07,210 --> 02:00:07,891
Yeah.
And it's,

2715
02:00:07,891 --> 02:00:10,420
so there are a few motor functions that
I think it's affected,

2716
02:00:10,421 --> 02:00:11,310
but it didn't.
Yeah,

2717
02:00:11,320 --> 02:00:12,640
as you say,
it didn't affect his cognitive,

2718
02:00:12,641 --> 02:00:14,480
so that'll be being released.
So,

2719
02:00:14,620 --> 02:00:19,620
so follow at WTP underscore live on
twitter and on the school they'll find

2720
02:00:20,351 --> 02:00:20,710
it.

2721
02:00:20,710 --> 02:00:22,630
Just find a way with paypal.
Anyway,

2722
02:00:22,631 --> 02:00:26,740
so what Richard Dawkins was saying and
his people are going to be angry at him

2723
02:00:26,741 --> 02:00:31,390
on twitter regardless of what he says,
but I still affirm that in the state

2724
02:00:31,391 --> 02:00:34,090
it's in the states,
the conversation around abortion is

2725
02:00:34,360 --> 02:00:38,350
uniquely different from the way that it
is in Europe and in Australia.

2726
02:00:38,740 --> 02:00:42,880
It's much more of a,
it's just much more of a full pipeline

2727
02:00:42,881 --> 02:00:47,881
issue and I wonder whether in hindsight
it wouldn't have been better for row the

2728
02:00:47,981 --> 02:00:51,400
way not to actually have been decided by
the Supreme Court that way.

2729
02:00:51,550 --> 02:00:52,390
What?
Well,

2730
02:00:52,391 --> 02:00:54,580
just because I know people are going to
have,

2731
02:00:54,581 --> 02:00:57,760
you don't have this as well.
You fucking CIS gender piece of Shit.

2732
02:00:57,820 --> 02:01:00,460
I believe.
I believe in what their surrogate mom

2733
02:01:00,480 --> 02:01:04,720
leave and abortion rights,
but I don't believe that it's that you

2734
02:01:04,721 --> 02:01:09,721
can find in the constitution of the
United States a right so inalienable

2735
02:01:10,720 --> 02:01:13,030
that the Supreme Court,
like where is it in the constitution.

2736
02:01:13,060 --> 02:01:15,520
The Supreme Court said there's a right
to privacy,

2737
02:01:15,940 --> 02:01:20,940
therefore there's a right to abortion
because we don't want to interfere in

2738
02:01:21,250 --> 02:01:25,840
women's affairs.
But that presupposes that the embryo

2739
02:01:25,841 --> 02:01:29,560
isn't a human,
you don't have the right to privacy to

2740
02:01:29,561 --> 02:01:31,420
kill somebody.
Right.

2741
02:01:31,421 --> 02:01:32,770
I mean,
if I go into a room,

2742
02:01:33,160 --> 02:01:36,670
my right to privacy,
it doesn't extend to me get being able

2743
02:01:36,671 --> 02:01:39,680
to get away with killing a baby.
The question of whether or not it's a

2744
02:01:39,681 --> 02:01:41,390
baby is the relevant question.
Right.

2745
02:01:41,391 --> 02:01:43,340
That's not addressed at,
you know,

2746
02:01:43,390 --> 02:01:44,270
in,
in row.

2747
02:01:44,660 --> 02:01:47,870
So I think that it should be legal,
but I think that it should be legal

2748
02:01:48,140 --> 02:01:51,770
through the legislative process.
I think that is a legitimate democratic

2749
02:01:52,250 --> 02:01:55,220
aspiration for people to be able to,
and if it means that it does,

2750
02:01:55,250 --> 02:01:58,280
it's not legal in Alabama because a
majority of people in Alabama don't want

2751
02:01:58,281 --> 02:02:00,230
it.
I don't think the founding fathers would

2752
02:02:00,231 --> 02:02:01,100
have a problem with that.

2753
02:02:01,190 --> 02:02:03,470
Well,
there's a strong amount of large amount

2754
02:02:03,471 --> 02:02:06,830
of people that don't want men talking
about this at all,

2755
02:02:07,190 --> 02:02:10,010
that they will follow.
You should be able to discuss this.

2756
02:02:10,020 --> 02:02:11,470
Yes,
this is the problem.

2757
02:02:11,480 --> 02:02:13,570
That is one of the main problems and
female issue.

2758
02:02:13,620 --> 02:02:18,620
Remember as well woman being upset that
a man with no stake in the game is

2759
02:02:19,251 --> 02:02:22,820
stepping up and saying that a woman
should or should not be able to have an

2760
02:02:22,821 --> 02:02:23,230
abortion?

2761
02:02:23,230 --> 02:02:24,063
Well,
why?

2762
02:02:24,310 --> 02:02:27,370
I mean how do I have stake in the game
of whether or not,

2763
02:02:27,371 --> 02:02:28,990
for example,
murder should be legal.

2764
02:02:29,080 --> 02:02:29,421
Well,
okay,

2765
02:02:29,421 --> 02:02:31,100
this is not that.
This is,

2766
02:02:31,130 --> 02:02:33,820
this is something different.
This is someone

2767
02:02:36,260 --> 02:02:40,400
in might be to you,
but it might not be to them if it's just

2768
02:02:40,410 --> 02:02:41,243
having like,
okay,

2769
02:02:41,720 --> 02:02:45,320
here's the morning after pill.
Is that the same as an abortion?

2770
02:02:46,820 --> 02:02:49,380
I don't care because I don't think
there's anything wrong with abortion.

2771
02:02:49,381 --> 02:02:49,821
It,
no,

2772
02:02:49,821 --> 02:02:50,750
I don't think there's any wrong.

2773
02:02:50,780 --> 02:02:53,050
Well,
the shutter is if it's a nine month old

2774
02:02:53,080 --> 02:02:54,760
baby,
the baby's in there and it's about to

2775
02:02:54,761 --> 02:02:56,920
come out the next day,
decided to open her up and stabbed in

2776
02:02:56,921 --> 02:02:57,200
the head.

2777
02:02:57,200 --> 02:03:00,620
This is what I'm arguing for is that is
a kind of incrementalism which you were

2778
02:03:00,621 --> 02:03:01,550
just alluding to.
Right.

2779
02:03:01,551 --> 02:03:03,320
It's not a black or white thing.
Why can't we?

2780
02:03:03,500 --> 02:03:07,700
Why can't we all appreciate that it's
both because it's become so polarized in

2781
02:03:07,701 --> 02:03:12,140
the United States that both positions
are bullshit and people on both sides

2782
02:03:12,141 --> 02:03:17,141
know that both positions are bullshit.
It's bullshit to say that it is just a

2783
02:03:17,331 --> 02:03:21,170
women's health issue and has no ethical
implications whatsoever.

2784
02:03:21,200 --> 02:03:22,550
Even if,
as you say,

2785
02:03:22,940 --> 02:03:25,940
you're talking about cutting a woman
open at nine months and stabbing in the

2786
02:03:26,300 --> 02:03:29,690
embryo in the head.
It's also bullshit to say that the

2787
02:03:29,691 --> 02:03:33,830
instant an egg is fertilized,
that is a person that should have all of

2788
02:03:33,831 --> 02:03:38,060
the rights to life than an adult should
have and then it's murder to kill a

2789
02:03:38,061 --> 02:03:40,430
blastocyst,
but smaller than the size of the head of

2790
02:03:40,431 --> 02:03:44,630
a pin positions a stupid,
this is an incremental situation.

2791
02:03:44,630 --> 02:03:46,520
Life evolves.
It grows,

2792
02:03:46,521 --> 02:03:49,100
a fetus grows.
It becomes a human being.

2793
02:03:49,101 --> 02:03:50,000
I mean,
Peter Singer,

2794
02:03:50,270 --> 02:03:53,480
the great philosopher,
also an Australian says that under

2795
02:03:53,481 --> 02:03:55,010
certain conditions,
infanticide,

2796
02:03:55,011 --> 02:03:57,800
the killing of babies should be legal
and could be ethical.

2797
02:03:57,830 --> 02:04:00,440
While he's an animal nut,
he loves animals more than,

2798
02:04:00,510 --> 02:04:02,760
but he makes a legitimate point,
which is that,

2799
02:04:02,830 --> 02:04:04,550
you know,
why does it make a difference?

2800
02:04:04,820 --> 02:04:08,330
One day after the baby is born,
I suppose you've got a premature baby

2801
02:04:08,331 --> 02:04:11,470
that's born four weeks early.
Uh,

2802
02:04:11,600 --> 02:04:14,120
in fact,
now we can already make babies survive

2803
02:04:14,121 --> 02:04:16,850
at right at right around the point of
viability,

2804
02:04:16,851 --> 02:04:20,270
which is where abortion is still on the,
on the fringe of.

2805
02:04:20,271 --> 02:04:23,300
So say you've got a 22 or 23,
24 week old,

2806
02:04:23,690 --> 02:04:25,750
a baby,
not,

2807
02:04:25,940 --> 02:04:30,940
not we called baby you timing from the,
from the moment of inception conception

2808
02:04:31,790 --> 02:04:34,830
that could live outside the womb.
Right?

2809
02:04:34,880 --> 02:04:37,500
But the moment it gets born,
it becomes murder to kill it.

2810
02:04:37,770 --> 02:04:38,040
But you

2811
02:04:38,040 --> 02:04:41,460
could have killed exactly the same
organism with exactly the same future

2812
02:04:41,490 --> 02:04:45,450
and exactly the same prospects and
exactly the same life if it was inside

2813
02:04:45,451 --> 02:04:49,320
the womb and of states.
Uh,

2814
02:04:49,321 --> 02:04:51,570
well on underbrush,
on Roe v Wade,

2815
02:04:51,660 --> 02:04:54,830
I'm not talking about late term,
I'm talking about the point of viability

2816
02:04:54,850 --> 02:04:56,790
beat Roe v Wade state,
uh,

2817
02:04:56,890 --> 02:04:58,160
the viability time.
Uh,

2818
02:04:58,170 --> 02:05:00,270
it's,
it's been interpreted as being like that

2819
02:05:00,271 --> 02:05:03,530
20 to 24 week.
But this is specifically say that I

2820
02:05:03,531 --> 02:05:04,231
don't,
I don't think,

2821
02:05:04,231 --> 02:05:07,080
I don't know whether or not that comes
out of the actual ruling where they were

2822
02:05:07,081 --> 02:05:09,900
writing it in Roe v Wade,
but I do know that that is the way that

2823
02:05:09,901 --> 02:05:12,180
it's been interpreted by lower courts
since then.

2824
02:05:12,250 --> 02:05:13,680
But,
but maybe they actually spelled out the

2825
02:05:13,681 --> 02:05:15,330
number of weeks.
Either way,

2826
02:05:16,200 --> 02:05:17,790
you know,
he's pointing to a,

2827
02:05:17,791 --> 02:05:21,150
to a legitimate conundrum.
It was sort of moral hypocrisy,

2828
02:05:22,830 --> 02:05:23,820
slippery issue.

2829
02:05:23,850 --> 02:05:25,700
It's not simple black or white.
Right.

2830
02:05:25,710 --> 02:05:28,650
And the idea that we shouldn't be
allowed to think and talk about the

2831
02:05:28,770 --> 02:05:31,710
moral quandary of this because we can't
have babies.

2832
02:05:31,740 --> 02:05:33,040
Well,
I'm not agreeing as silly.

2833
02:05:33,080 --> 02:05:34,290
I'm not agreeing to that.
No,

2834
02:05:34,291 --> 02:05:36,240
I know what I'm saying.
That is an argument that women want to

2835
02:05:36,241 --> 02:05:41,241
take it because they feel,
they feel like there's this unjust sort

2836
02:05:43,291 --> 02:05:48,000
of male dominance on the female
reproductive system.

2837
02:05:48,060 --> 02:05:53,060
Look when I see a bunch of white men,
white old men sitting in Congress making

2838
02:05:53,281 --> 02:05:57,060
rules against women,
predominantly young women,

2839
02:05:57,090 --> 02:06:01,560
predominantly young women of color who
are in areas that have less the least

2840
02:06:01,561 --> 02:06:05,070
amount of access,
which siphoned legally women of color.

2841
02:06:05,100 --> 02:06:08,160
How so?
Because safe legal abortions are more

2842
02:06:08,161 --> 02:06:12,630
difficult to obtain in places like rural
Alabama than they are in places like New

2843
02:06:12,630 --> 02:06:13,520
York City.
Yeah,

2844
02:06:13,530 --> 02:06:15,990
but there's a lot of white people,
Rural Alabama.

2845
02:06:16,010 --> 02:06:18,900
I don't necessarily think it's a racial
issue as much as the poverty issue,

2846
02:06:19,380 --> 02:06:22,590
especially like things like planned
parenthood and shutting down planned

2847
02:06:22,591 --> 02:06:24,000
parenthood's.
They're just going to affect people that

2848
02:06:24,001 --> 02:06:25,140
don't have much money.
Yup.

2849
02:06:25,200 --> 02:06:27,270
Who had disproportionately people of
color as well.

2850
02:06:27,750 --> 02:06:31,370
Disproportionately in terms of the
actual numbers of human beings are

2851
02:06:32,020 --> 02:06:35,400
intended to percentage wise a lot.
The actual emotional lives of human

2852
02:06:35,401 --> 02:06:36,750
beings.
It's not right,

2853
02:06:36,751 --> 02:06:38,640
but you can understand how it would look
bad.

2854
02:06:38,641 --> 02:06:41,860
If you're a black woman ad people of
color to that,

2855
02:06:41,861 --> 02:06:44,520
it accentuates the issue.
It makes it even more problematic.

2856
02:06:44,521 --> 02:06:47,340
It makes it more of a big left wing
progressive issue.

2857
02:06:47,760 --> 02:06:49,110
Right.
That can't be argued against.

2858
02:06:49,111 --> 02:06:51,960
Do you think the is discrimination
against people of Color?

2859
02:06:51,990 --> 02:06:52,980
Oh,
don't want to do that.

2860
02:06:53,280 --> 02:06:56,580
It's people,
but do you think that the optics would

2861
02:06:56,581 --> 02:06:59,760
look as bad if all of the old white men
who were writing the laws were black?

2862
02:07:00,630 --> 02:07:03,360
I think it all looks bad.
I don't think I would look as bad.

2863
02:07:03,750 --> 02:07:04,950
The idea,
hold on a second.

2864
02:07:04,980 --> 02:07:08,940
You're saying that if old white men make
these issues,

2865
02:07:08,970 --> 02:07:10,800
it doesn't look as bad.
Know what I'm saying?

2866
02:07:10,801 --> 02:07:12,210
It looks worse.
Bad as possible.

2867
02:07:12,211 --> 02:07:16,620
It looks worse than it was black and men
were making this issue against all poor

2868
02:07:16,621 --> 02:07:21,600
people because old white men just seem
to drip privilege because they use every

2869
02:07:21,601 --> 02:07:23,540
single checkbox they've got going for
them.

2870
02:07:23,550 --> 02:07:26,480
They both male,
they're white and they're all sure

2871
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:28,030
argument.
Anyway,

2872
02:07:28,080 --> 02:07:30,000
they're tortured arguments.
Thomas,

2873
02:07:30,120 --> 02:07:32,730
you don't think it looks weird when
Clarence Thomas Votes against abortion?

2874
02:07:33,270 --> 02:07:34,440
Yeah,
I do.

2875
02:07:34,580 --> 02:07:35,413
Yeah,
so there you go.

2876
02:07:35,620 --> 02:07:36,100
But I mean,
my

2877
02:07:36,100 --> 02:07:38,040
point,
my point is simply yes.

2878
02:07:38,850 --> 02:07:39,510
Okay.

2879
02:07:39,510 --> 02:07:43,800
I take the optics as being a bad thing.
I think the optics are worse if it's

2880
02:07:43,801 --> 02:07:46,160
white people and if it's black people,
but I'm happy to,

2881
02:07:46,290 --> 02:07:49,440
I'm happy to yield that point to concede
that point if that's the sticking one.

2882
02:07:50,100 --> 02:07:54,710
The point is we have to be able to have
conversations about anything without

2883
02:07:54,711 --> 02:07:58,730
allowing our identities to prevent us
from being able to think.

2884
02:07:59,630 --> 02:08:04,160
To ponder that I came on this show was
because I was getting into an argument

2885
02:08:04,400 --> 02:08:09,400
with an activist about whether or not I
had a right to have an opinion about

2886
02:08:10,401 --> 02:08:13,250
whether or not Stephen Colbert had been
racist.

2887
02:08:13,910 --> 02:08:16,520
Right.
And she was claiming that I didn't,

2888
02:08:16,550 --> 02:08:19,550
I didn't have a right to have a
conversation about it because I'm a

2889
02:08:19,551 --> 02:08:20,384
white man.

2890
02:08:20,420 --> 02:08:23,480
Well that was just the way she tried to
get out of the argument.

2891
02:08:23,930 --> 02:08:28,550
You know the whole thing before that was
her not understanding the joke and she

2892
02:08:28,551 --> 02:08:31,280
didn't want to own up to the fact that
she didn't understand the joke.

2893
02:08:31,281 --> 02:08:33,200
And then when you sort of explained it
to her,

2894
02:08:33,201 --> 02:08:35,880
she was using the you as a white man
thing.

2895
02:08:35,881 --> 02:08:37,910
They try to deny your opinion,
don't you think?

2896
02:08:37,911 --> 02:08:41,060
It happens all the time.
I mean just exactly what you're saying.

2897
02:08:41,240 --> 02:08:43,640
I think we're,
we're both on the same page here in that

2898
02:08:43,641 --> 02:08:46,100
I think we both agree that you should
absolutely be able to have a

2899
02:08:46,101 --> 02:08:48,230
conversation about this.
The question is,

2900
02:08:48,560 --> 02:08:53,560
should a man be able to decide what a
woman can and can't do with their body

2901
02:08:54,141 --> 02:08:57,080
and should we be able to make the laws?
But you just smuggled in the term with

2902
02:08:57,081 --> 02:08:57,914
her body.

2903
02:08:57,950 --> 02:08:58,850
Well,
it is a baby.

2904
02:08:58,851 --> 02:09:01,370
If it's a blastocyst and it is in our
body,

2905
02:09:01,580 --> 02:09:03,860
right?
She's a blessing to her body,

2906
02:09:03,880 --> 02:09:05,990
right?
So that is a decision that we're talking

2907
02:09:05,991 --> 02:09:08,870
about that.
So when it gets to be an embryo or fetus

2908
02:09:09,470 --> 02:09:11,690
along the way,
somewhere along the way,

2909
02:09:11,691 --> 02:09:15,740
it ceases to be just her body,
but an unrelated male human being.

2910
02:09:15,770 --> 02:09:19,790
When should that person be able to make
a decision and should a male human being

2911
02:09:19,791 --> 02:09:22,580
be able to make a decision at all?
Because if you can make a decision about

2912
02:09:23,030 --> 02:09:25,940
the embryo or a fetus,
can you make it about the blastocyst?

2913
02:09:25,960 --> 02:09:29,510
Like when can you decide and why should
a man be able to make that decision in

2914
02:09:29,511 --> 02:09:30,850
the first place?
Because he's got,

2915
02:09:30,950 --> 02:09:34,790
because he's got a brain as well and
we're rolling and you deciding trolling

2916
02:09:34,791 --> 02:09:37,400
someone's body,
you are talking about controlling a

2917
02:09:37,401 --> 02:09:38,151
body.
No.

2918
02:09:38,151 --> 02:09:41,870
Which a woman with a black side of her,
you tell her she can't take care of that

2919
02:09:41,871 --> 02:09:45,100
blastocyst and remove it.
She must make it viable and bring it to

2920
02:09:45,160 --> 02:09:47,290
birth.
We're talking about when a homosapien

2921
02:09:47,291 --> 02:09:49,660
comes into existence.
That's a philosophical and ethical

2922
02:09:49,661 --> 02:09:50,120
questions.

2923
02:09:50,120 --> 02:09:50,631
No,
it's not.

2924
02:09:50,631 --> 02:09:52,250
If you're telling me framing it as
being,

2925
02:09:52,251 --> 02:09:53,660
if you're telling a woman's body,
no,

2926
02:09:53,661 --> 02:09:53,841
no,
no,

2927
02:09:53,841 --> 02:09:57,770
because we're talking about the rights.
Giving someone a ride or stopping them

2928
02:09:57,771 --> 02:09:58,730
and controlling them.
Yeah.

2929
02:09:58,760 --> 02:10:01,010
If you're talking about a blastocyst
inside a woman's body,

2930
02:10:01,100 --> 02:10:02,240
yeah,
and you're a man and you decide,

2931
02:10:02,241 --> 02:10:05,750
you don't even know this woman.
You decide by your moral argument and

2932
02:10:05,751 --> 02:10:08,870
judgment she should not be able to
terminate that blastocyst.

2933
02:10:09,080 --> 02:10:11,930
Then you are deciding what she can do
with her body.

2934
02:10:12,810 --> 02:10:14,340
No.
You're deciding what she can do to the

2935
02:10:14,341 --> 02:10:16,290
blastocyst.
It's in her body.

2936
02:10:16,420 --> 02:10:17,790
It's inside her buddy.
You sure?

2937
02:10:17,791 --> 02:10:19,410
It's also inside her body when it's nine
one

2938
02:10:19,430 --> 02:10:23,030
it's all so you're,
so you're saying a man unrelated man

2939
02:10:23,210 --> 02:10:26,330
should be able to have input on whether
a woman should not determine it.

2940
02:10:26,331 --> 02:10:27,590
A blastocyst saying,

2941
02:10:27,870 --> 02:10:31,560
saying that the democratic institutions
of the state should be able to decide

2942
02:10:31,561 --> 02:10:32,060
that

2943
02:10:32,060 --> 02:10:34,000
mean talking about democratic,
we're

2944
02:10:34,010 --> 02:10:36,500
talking very specifically about a man.
What are you talking,

2945
02:10:36,501 --> 02:10:38,690
being able to decide if it's a
dictatorship,

2946
02:10:38,691 --> 02:10:41,450
then I don't agree with that.
I do believe that people should be able

2947
02:10:41,451 --> 02:10:43,340
to,
I think this is something that people

2948
02:10:43,341 --> 02:10:44,600
ought to be able to vote on.
Yes.

2949
02:10:44,780 --> 02:10:47,990
I personally again,
favor abortion rights,

2950
02:10:48,260 --> 02:10:50,840
but I don't think that the,
I don't think that the gender of the

2951
02:10:50,841 --> 02:10:55,841
person who is voted into power by the
voting public is relevant in terms of

2952
02:10:56,481 --> 02:10:59,720
whether or not the voting public thinks
that embryos are human beings,

2953
02:10:59,750 --> 02:11:01,160
but you don't think that?
I just think,

2954
02:11:01,161 --> 02:11:03,200
I don't think that embryos have a right
to life,

2955
02:11:03,710 --> 02:11:06,080
but I don't,
I don't think that it makes sense to say

2956
02:11:06,290 --> 02:11:10,040
that an embryo is just the woman's body.
We're not talking about an embryo.

2957
02:11:10,100 --> 02:11:11,600
We're talking about the entire process,
right?

2958
02:11:11,990 --> 02:11:15,170
The entire process of conception to
birth and that somewhere along the way.

2959
02:11:15,170 --> 02:11:17,090
What do you like and then you arguing
that if,

2960
02:11:17,100 --> 02:11:19,910
if there,
if there are males in positions of power

2961
02:11:19,911 --> 02:11:23,510
and congress that they should have to
abstain from ruling.

2962
02:11:23,760 --> 02:11:26,870
I'm sure shit in male justices on the
supreme court have to abstain from

2963
02:11:26,871 --> 02:11:31,871
voting on abortion cases.
I'm arguing that it's problematic when a

2964
02:11:31,881 --> 02:11:36,881
man decides who can not get pregnant,
decides when a baby is actually a baby,

2965
02:11:40,730 --> 02:11:44,470
so it shouldn't be allowed to vote for.
I'm not saying that I'm the same

2966
02:11:44,480 --> 02:11:47,600
candidates that are antiabortion.
Don't you think it's problematic that a

2967
02:11:47,601 --> 02:11:50,330
guy should decide whether it,
like say if you're a hardcore where I've

2968
02:11:50,331 --> 02:11:53,470
already said it looks bad,
optics is luck,

2969
02:11:53,480 --> 02:11:55,640
looks man,
but what does a couple of medic main

2970
02:11:55,641 --> 02:11:56,730
other than looks?
Well,

2971
02:11:56,780 --> 02:11:57,640
it's not.
It's a,

2972
02:11:57,641 --> 02:11:59,540
it's a huge issue.
It's not looks,

2973
02:11:59,600 --> 02:12:03,260
it's a huge issue that someone who
cannot get pregnant decides that another

2974
02:12:03,261 --> 02:12:05,720
human being,
that they're totally unrelated to can't

2975
02:12:05,721 --> 02:12:09,230
make the decision that five cells that
are bundled together must be brought to

2976
02:12:09,231 --> 02:12:10,064
life.

2977
02:12:10,280 --> 02:12:12,320
They think that those five cells are a
person.

2978
02:12:12,470 --> 02:12:13,550
Well,
they don't even know this.

2979
02:12:13,580 --> 02:12:14,960
I mean,
you're just a lot of cells.

2980
02:12:15,110 --> 02:12:17,530
They don't even know this person.
They don't know this for wash.

2981
02:12:17,550 --> 02:12:21,310
They have any power over this person and
why should they have any power or his to

2982
02:12:21,400 --> 02:12:25,820
determining what are they controlling a
person's body and when are they saving a

2983
02:12:25,821 --> 02:12:27,200
baby?
Well,

2984
02:12:27,201 --> 02:12:28,550
that's precisely the,
the question,

2985
02:12:28,551 --> 02:12:29,210
isn't it?
Right.

2986
02:12:29,210 --> 02:12:30,410
That is the question.
Should they,

2987
02:12:30,411 --> 02:12:33,770
should a male have the right to
determine whether or not a woman can

2988
02:12:34,190 --> 02:12:36,230
murder her newborn baby?
That's a good question.

2989
02:12:36,530 --> 02:12:37,520
I say no.

2990
02:12:39,290 --> 02:12:40,850
At least she consistent.
Yeah.

2991
02:12:41,120 --> 02:12:44,900
I don't think,
I don't think anybody should be able to

2992
02:12:44,901 --> 02:12:47,750
murder a baby.
I don't think a man should have the

2993
02:12:47,751 --> 02:12:49,130
right.
I think we,

2994
02:12:49,131 --> 02:12:51,980
society as a society collectively know.
You were just,

2995
02:12:51,981 --> 02:12:53,080
I thought you were just saying that
you'd,

2996
02:12:53,120 --> 02:12:56,360
you'd think that a man should not be
able to prevent a mother from killing

2997
02:12:56,361 --> 02:12:57,131
her baby.
No,

2998
02:12:57,131 --> 02:12:58,550
that's,
I said that wrong.

2999
02:12:58,720 --> 02:13:01,220
What I mean is no,
because that is what you're saying with

3000
02:13:01,221 --> 02:13:04,480
regard to the abortion.
You're saying that a man shouldn't have

3001
02:13:04,481 --> 02:13:06,470
a,
should not have the right to prevent a

3002
02:13:06,471 --> 02:13:08,100
woman from killing her baby.
Very.

3003
02:13:08,930 --> 02:13:10,910
When we interrupt each other it's not
going to work.

3004
02:13:10,940 --> 02:13:12,120
Okay.
I,

3005
02:13:12,121 --> 02:13:14,990
I know what you're saying and I know
that you're saying that we should all

3006
02:13:14,991 --> 02:13:16,880
have a stake in this.
We shall be able to discuss this.

3007
02:13:17,210 --> 02:13:19,970
I just think that when you talk about
like,

3008
02:13:19,971 --> 02:13:22,580
especially like a blastocyst eventually
becoming an embryo,

3009
02:13:22,581 --> 02:13:27,290
we have to agree in some way,
shape or form that you and I don't have

3010
02:13:27,291 --> 02:13:30,370
a stake in it.
We're not going to get pregnant.

3011
02:13:30,640 --> 02:13:31,473
No,
it's a a way,

3012
02:13:31,530 --> 02:13:31,980
it's a way

3013
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:33,900
bigger issue for a woman than it is for
Matt.

3014
02:13:34,410 --> 02:13:36,960
Yes,
so we agree.

3015
02:13:37,440 --> 02:13:40,800
We agree that it's a way bigger issue
for a woman that I should be able to

3016
02:13:40,801 --> 02:13:42,870
discuss it.
I just think we both agree that you

3017
02:13:42,871 --> 02:13:46,350
should be able to discuss it,
should be able to debate.

3018
02:13:46,351 --> 02:13:51,351
Where I'm coming from here is that I
feel like we use identity politics to

3019
02:13:51,750 --> 02:13:56,640
deprive other people of standing to
discuss questions that are actually

3020
02:13:56,641 --> 02:13:58,590
universal because they're moral
questions.

3021
02:13:58,970 --> 02:14:02,700
And I think we all have one thing that I
tried to do as much as possible as

3022
02:14:02,701 --> 02:14:04,500
understand where people who I disagree
with,

3023
02:14:04,520 --> 02:14:05,353
uh,
coming from.

3024
02:14:05,900 --> 02:14:07,350
Uh,
and I know you do that as well.

3025
02:14:07,620 --> 02:14:12,620
So I am pro abortion rights,
but in order for me to understand where

3026
02:14:12,661 --> 02:14:15,150
people who detest abortion are coming
from,

3027
02:14:15,450 --> 02:14:20,450
it's necessary for me to make the sort
of leap of empathy and logic into their

3028
02:14:21,151 --> 02:14:23,370
camp and see things from the way that
they see them,

3029
02:14:23,371 --> 02:14:26,160
which is that the instant egg is
fertilized for them.

3030
02:14:26,160 --> 02:14:29,610
That becomes a sacred,
a sacred question of a new life where

3031
02:14:29,611 --> 02:14:33,210
it's no longer about the woman's body.
It's now a moral and ethical question

3032
02:14:33,211 --> 02:14:36,450
that we're all involved in because we're
all involved in what our culture is

3033
02:14:36,451 --> 02:14:39,090
allowed to do and who it's allowed to
kill and how it's allowed to kill them.

3034
02:14:39,091 --> 02:14:42,720
So it becomes a bit more like a death
penalty question where you might say,

3035
02:14:43,110 --> 02:14:44,400
well,
I'm never going to be up for the death

3036
02:14:44,401 --> 02:14:47,400
penalty because I'm never going to do
anything that would require that would

3037
02:14:47,401 --> 02:14:50,730
put me on death row.
So what standing do I have to be in

3038
02:14:50,731 --> 02:14:54,690
favor or against the death penalty?
That's sort of a moot question.

3039
02:14:54,691 --> 02:14:57,810
Like we're all in the society together.
We'll have to figure out what's right

3040
02:14:57,811 --> 02:15:00,870
and wrong and if we've got a brain,
we should have conversations about

3041
02:15:00,871 --> 02:15:05,010
what's good or bad and the fact that I'm
unlikely to be in a specific scenario,

3042
02:15:05,190 --> 02:15:08,340
it doesn't actually really give me less
standing to have a conversation about it

3043
02:15:08,550 --> 02:15:10,200
or even to write laws about it.

3044
02:15:10,230 --> 02:15:12,780
If people vote me into a position where
I can write laws about it.

3045
02:15:13,020 --> 02:15:14,940
Well,
I certainly think it does when you're

3046
02:15:14,941 --> 02:15:17,340
talking about a blastocyst,
I certainly think it does.

3047
02:15:17,341 --> 02:15:19,950
When you talk about the argument of
conception and when something becomes

3048
02:15:19,951 --> 02:15:21,540
alive.
So let me ask you this.

3049
02:15:21,840 --> 02:15:24,180
When do you think abortion should be
legal?

3050
02:15:24,360 --> 02:15:27,150
Do you think it should be legal up to
nine months or these things should be

3051
02:15:27,151 --> 02:15:30,780
cut off period?
I think it should basically be legal all

3052
02:15:30,781 --> 02:15:33,120
the way up to nine months.
And I probably agree with Peter Singer

3053
02:15:33,121 --> 02:15:35,920
that maybe,
maybe it's occasionally okay to kill by

3054
02:15:35,921 --> 02:15:36,754
Biz.
So you,

3055
02:15:36,990 --> 02:15:39,960
wow.
So you think that a viable baby inside a

3056
02:15:39,961 --> 02:15:42,390
woman's body at nine months old,
she's fully pregnant.

3057
02:15:42,660 --> 02:15:45,930
As long as that baby doesn't come out,
she should be able to kill it.

3058
02:15:45,960 --> 02:15:47,430
Well,
I'm saying even if it does come out,

3059
02:15:47,460 --> 02:15:51,960
maybe
because I'm evil,

3060
02:15:52,020 --> 02:15:56,520
that's
murder a baby.

3061
02:15:57,330 --> 02:15:58,870
Well,
religious people think that you think

3062
02:15:58,871 --> 02:16:01,770
that because they think that blast
assistant blastocyst about religious

3063
02:16:01,771 --> 02:16:02,820
people.
I'm talking about you.

3064
02:16:03,990 --> 02:16:04,823
Yeah,
I don't.

3065
02:16:05,150 --> 02:16:10,150
I think it's obvious that the process of
going from an egg into a Joe Rogan is

3066
02:16:11,101 --> 02:16:16,101
such a long and incremental passage that
I don't see any reason why 20 weeks or

3067
02:16:17,101 --> 02:16:22,101
22 weeks or even vaginal birth is like
the absolute moral cutoff I would watch.

3068
02:16:24,720 --> 02:16:27,810
What you think though,
that that's weird that you have this

3069
02:16:27,811 --> 02:16:30,700
like really rigid opinion on it.
I don't have any rigid opinion.

3070
02:16:31,410 --> 02:16:33,340
You could kill a baby.
You don't think that's rigid?

3071
02:16:33,370 --> 02:16:36,370
No,
cause I'm absolutely open to being

3072
02:16:36,400 --> 02:16:39,040
convinced out of that.
It's just I happened to read a book by

3073
02:16:39,041 --> 02:16:41,800
paid us sing or about that.
And so he sort of convinced me,

3074
02:16:42,040 --> 02:16:44,860
I mean what you would have,
that you should be able to kill a baby

3075
02:16:44,861 --> 02:16:45,694
when it's born.

3076
02:16:45,790 --> 02:16:48,130
Well,
that they would be systems in place that

3077
02:16:48,131 --> 02:16:50,680
would like,
that would help mothers.

3078
02:16:50,710 --> 02:16:53,950
I don't think that it should be,
I sort of agree with Bill Clinton's old

3079
02:16:53,951 --> 02:16:56,440
framing that abortion should be safe,
legal and rare,

3080
02:16:57,130 --> 02:16:58,900
right?
That you should have as many

3081
02:16:58,901 --> 02:17:01,330
opportunities for people not to get
pregnant in the first place.

3082
02:17:01,540 --> 02:17:05,650
Widespread contracept contraception,
widespread sex education.

3083
02:17:06,130 --> 02:17:09,760
Uh,
and that this should not just be a form

3084
02:17:09,761 --> 02:17:12,310
of birth control.
On the other hand,

3085
02:17:12,311 --> 02:17:17,311
if people find themselves in a horrible
pickle and that I know of how to get out

3086
02:17:17,921 --> 02:17:19,390
of it,
you think you should be able to hit the

3087
02:17:19,391 --> 02:17:22,030
baby with a rock?
I used to do it.

3088
02:17:22,040 --> 02:17:22,930
He has a gun.
I didn't really,

3089
02:17:23,480 --> 02:17:24,880
yeah.
I don't know,

3090
02:17:24,881 --> 02:17:26,210
Joe.
It sounds pretty horrible,

3091
02:17:26,270 --> 02:17:28,960
doesn't it?
It does,

3092
02:17:28,961 --> 02:17:31,030
but again,
you can't get pregnant.

3093
02:17:31,110 --> 02:17:32,740
I can't get pregnant,
so that's true.

3094
02:17:32,920 --> 02:17:33,240
Pete.

3095
02:17:33,240 --> 02:17:36,400
I could feel my kids three holes.
They're getting furious at us right now

3096
02:17:36,401 --> 02:17:39,220
for even discussing it because we can't
get pregnant.

3097
02:17:39,310 --> 02:17:41,110
They're wrong.
They're wrong.

3098
02:17:41,170 --> 02:17:42,730
But you're right.
No,

3099
02:17:42,790 --> 02:17:44,680
I'm right that I should be able to talk
about it,

3100
02:17:44,681 --> 02:17:48,790
but I don't know what the answer is.
You definitely should be able to talk

3101
02:17:48,791 --> 02:17:50,320
about it,
but it should be able to kill a baby

3102
02:17:50,321 --> 02:17:51,250
with a rock.
Yeah,

3103
02:17:51,251 --> 02:17:52,940
probably.
Nah,

3104
02:17:52,970 --> 02:17:54,460
probably not.
When I talk about that,

3105
02:17:54,461 --> 02:17:57,880
I'll never be on death row and maybe
that's how I get on death killing my

3106
02:17:57,881 --> 02:18:01,960
children.
It's so evil and unsympathetic and

3107
02:18:02,020 --> 02:18:06,790
un-empathetic paying a blastocyst is the
same journal it is,

3108
02:18:06,791 --> 02:18:10,600
but you don't see that little fucker
last assistance as long as it would have

3109
02:18:10,601 --> 02:18:13,320
to have like reading glasses on.
Do you look at it at the head of it?

3110
02:18:13,321 --> 02:18:16,600
As long as you put a comforter over the
baby so you can't see what's happening.

3111
02:18:16,630 --> 02:18:20,980
I think what we're talking about is a
really complicated subject and I think

3112
02:18:20,981 --> 02:18:25,330
it's one of the reasons why people like
to box it and put it into this yes or no

3113
02:18:25,630 --> 02:18:28,200
black or white because it's so
complicated.

3114
02:18:28,210 --> 02:18:31,600
You really sit back and think that hey,
if you have an abortion at,

3115
02:18:31,630 --> 02:18:32,680
you know,
four weeks,

3116
02:18:32,681 --> 02:18:33,514
five weeks,
six,

3117
02:18:33,520 --> 02:18:35,170
when does it have fingers?
Yeah.

3118
02:18:35,171 --> 02:18:36,430
Why does it have a heartbeat?
When is it?

3119
02:18:36,431 --> 02:18:41,431
Okay.
And it's also incredibly fraught with

3120
02:18:41,800 --> 02:18:43,120
trip wires,
right?

3121
02:18:43,121 --> 02:18:45,090
I mean,
people are not going to be with me,

3122
02:18:45,120 --> 02:18:48,340
mason,
that you should be able to kill a baby

3123
02:18:48,341 --> 02:18:50,950
and people are not going to be happy
with you saying it should be able to

3124
02:18:50,951 --> 02:18:53,890
kill a blastocyst.
But I think more people will hate my

3125
02:18:53,891 --> 02:18:54,724
position.
Um,

3126
02:18:54,910 --> 02:18:56,680
if it even is a position,
well,

3127
02:18:56,681 --> 02:18:59,800
when does a blastocyst,
is it that the moment of conception,

3128
02:18:59,801 --> 02:19:02,620
like how much time do you have?
It's almost like a race to kill the

3129
02:19:02,621 --> 02:19:03,454
baby.
We need,

3130
02:19:05,260 --> 02:19:07,630
well,
some people don't think you should even

3131
02:19:07,631 --> 02:19:09,490
be able to use contraception.
Well,

3132
02:19:09,491 --> 02:19:11,800
that's right.
And also like this is one of those

3133
02:19:11,801 --> 02:19:14,110
things were a bit like pedophilia.
Uh,

3134
02:19:14,160 --> 02:19:16,360
it's,
it's a subject where it's not really

3135
02:19:16,570 --> 02:19:19,570
possible.
Like it's so it raises passions.

3136
02:19:19,600 --> 02:19:22,960
So immediately look at what happened to
Milo Yiannopoulos when he was talking

3137
02:19:22,961 --> 02:19:24,460
about his pedophilia stuff.
Right.

3138
02:19:24,530 --> 02:19:26,110
Well,
he was also talking about his own

3139
02:19:26,111 --> 02:19:28,400
personal experiences and framing

3140
02:19:28,400 --> 02:19:29,980
them in a positive way.
Yeah.

3141
02:19:29,990 --> 02:19:34,280
And even saying that he was a sexual
Predator last we said on my podcast when

3142
02:19:34,281 --> 02:19:37,640
he got on the other podcast when he was
on the drunken peasants podcast,

3143
02:19:37,641 --> 02:19:42,230
that's where it get got more weird
because then he started framing it in a

3144
02:19:42,231 --> 02:19:46,700
different way and saying that he thinks
that there is a lot of positive benefits

3145
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:49,160
to a young man.
Like,

3146
02:19:49,161 --> 02:19:50,780
uh,
I shouldn't say young man,

3147
02:19:50,810 --> 02:19:55,810
a boy having a relationship with a man
sexually that can help them and that

3148
02:19:56,780 --> 02:20:00,500
there's positive benefits to being
molested as a young boy.

3149
02:20:00,650 --> 02:20:03,500
I think that's obviously a horrible
thing to say.

3150
02:20:03,720 --> 02:20:07,800
I think what was going on was he was
trying to rationalize his own sexual

3151
02:20:07,801 --> 02:20:09,070
abuse.
Hmm.

3152
02:20:10,230 --> 02:20:12,030
I really do.
I mean,

3153
02:20:12,031 --> 02:20:16,830
I think in no way,
shape or form is it comfortable for a

3154
02:20:16,831 --> 02:20:20,670
young boy to be sexually abused by an
older man.

3155
02:20:20,940 --> 02:20:25,940
And I think that in this process of
rationalization he's created this way

3156
02:20:26,611 --> 02:20:30,420
that's empowered him.
And he's also rationalize that he was

3157
02:20:30,421 --> 02:20:33,480
the Predator and he keeps saying that
and joking around about it,

3158
02:20:33,800 --> 02:20:37,470
but he was the attain those,
I think he's a victim and I think his,

3159
02:20:38,370 --> 02:20:40,530
his,
he's a very strong,

3160
02:20:40,531 --> 02:20:45,531
smart guy and I think a lot of his
intelligence as allowed him to use his

3161
02:20:47,101 --> 02:20:52,020
perception of that event to sort of
shape it into a way that benefits him.

3162
02:20:52,180 --> 02:20:53,013
Yeah,
right,

3163
02:20:53,380 --> 02:20:55,240
right.
I mean the,

3164
02:20:55,630 --> 02:21:00,010
I was on a TV show in Australia where
there was a question of whether or not

3165
02:21:00,370 --> 02:21:03,640
we should be naming and shaming sexual
offenders,

3166
02:21:03,641 --> 02:21:08,260
sexual predators or people who've been
convicted of sex crimes and in the

3167
02:21:08,261 --> 02:21:10,450
meeting before we went on air because
it's a live show,

3168
02:21:10,510 --> 02:21:13,840
I raised the point that like I think the
more sort of interesting and

3169
02:21:13,841 --> 02:21:18,841
controversial angle here is what a
bloody horrible nightmare it would be to

3170
02:21:21,071 --> 02:21:24,310
be born being sexually attracted towards
infants.

3171
02:21:24,730 --> 02:21:28,660
Right now this is in no way to diminish
the monstrosity that is pedophilia.

3172
02:21:28,661 --> 02:21:33,250
I think it's the worst thing that you
can do to abuse the trust of children

3173
02:21:33,251 --> 02:21:37,750
who are too young to know any better,
but it's surely no walk in the park like

3174
02:21:37,751 --> 02:21:40,240
the reason I'm not a pedophile,
it's not because I'm a good person,

3175
02:21:40,330 --> 02:21:43,510
it's because I have no attraction
towards children.

3176
02:21:44,200 --> 02:21:46,600
Right?
Imagine if the only way that you could

3177
02:21:46,601 --> 02:21:51,190
express yourself sexually and find
fulfillment in life was by torturing

3178
02:21:51,191 --> 02:21:54,010
another human being.
Like you're basically a form of,

3179
02:21:54,430 --> 02:21:56,890
I don't want to use the wrong word here,
but a form of,

3180
02:21:56,891 --> 02:22:00,370
it's a form of psychopathy in some way
in the sense that like a psychopath can

3181
02:22:00,371 --> 02:22:03,160
only get fulfillment by doing something
that's awful.

3182
02:22:03,161 --> 02:22:06,130
So the job is to try to figure out how
to stop the psychopath from doing

3183
02:22:06,131 --> 02:22:07,960
something awful.
I'm not saying that pedophiles,

3184
02:22:07,961 --> 02:22:10,570
the psychopaths,
but you can see the analogy where if

3185
02:22:10,600 --> 02:22:14,170
your only way of finding fulfillment in
life is to rape children,

3186
02:22:14,500 --> 02:22:19,500
then let's address how to figure out how
to stop you from doing that thing rather

3187
02:22:20,291 --> 02:22:23,470
than demonizing you as a monster,
even if you don't do it.

3188
02:22:23,960 --> 02:22:26,070
Yeah,
for me to even say that,

3189
02:22:26,280 --> 02:22:28,290
a lot of people are going to push back
on that as well,

3190
02:22:28,291 --> 02:22:31,770
and it's a very similar thing to where
I'm just trying to figure out in my head

3191
02:22:31,771 --> 02:22:33,930
what makes the most sense to me.
And as you say,

3192
02:22:34,080 --> 02:22:37,590
it's got to be some kind of a spectrum
of like it can't be black and white

3193
02:22:37,650 --> 02:22:39,870
either on abortion or on something like
pedophilia.

3194
02:22:39,871 --> 02:22:42,720
But the moment you start having
conversations like this shit's going to

3195
02:22:42,721 --> 02:22:44,490
explode because people are very,
very,

3196
02:22:44,491 --> 02:22:47,130
very strident.
Like you've got to protect the babies.

3197
02:22:47,131 --> 02:22:49,050
Like you know,
going to protect the children.

3198
02:22:49,051 --> 02:22:50,160
Yes,
I understand that.

3199
02:22:50,730 --> 02:22:53,160
But does that make it impossible for us
to have conversations about it?

3200
02:22:53,290 --> 02:22:55,450
Right.
That's the issue is should you even be

3201
02:22:55,451 --> 02:22:59,170
allowed to have a conversation about it
and should you have a rigid black or

3202
02:22:59,171 --> 02:23:01,320
white view of this and if you are and
well,

3203
02:23:01,360 --> 02:23:03,160
here's the real question.
First of all,

3204
02:23:03,161 --> 02:23:06,490
we don't know what causes someone to be
sexually attracted to children.

3205
02:23:06,790 --> 02:23:08,590
And we don't know how many of those
people,

3206
02:23:08,591 --> 02:23:11,510
but there's a significant amount who are
actually molested themselves.

3207
02:23:11,980 --> 02:23:15,040
I mean that's a huge factor in,
in child abuse.

3208
02:23:15,580 --> 02:23:17,830
So what,
what causes that?

3209
02:23:17,831 --> 02:23:19,300
I mean is it,
and here's how to,

3210
02:23:19,420 --> 02:23:22,300
and even more fucked up throughout
history,

3211
02:23:22,330 --> 02:23:24,850
some of the greatest minds have been
pedophiles,

3212
02:23:25,570 --> 02:23:26,710
really.
Sure.

3213
02:23:26,740 --> 02:23:28,210
Socrates,
Plato.

3214
02:23:28,211 --> 02:23:31,750
I mean you can go back through history.
They were all fucking young kids.

3215
02:23:31,960 --> 02:23:35,860
Well then you had the Greeks were like
that when the Romans many,

3216
02:23:35,861 --> 02:23:36,880
many ancient culture

3217
02:23:36,900 --> 02:23:39,390
that was,
I think that was adolescents though,

3218
02:23:39,391 --> 02:23:40,500
right?
They will fucking right

3219
02:23:40,900 --> 02:23:45,070
fucking 12 year olds,
like [inaudible] was talking about

3220
02:23:45,550 --> 02:23:47,620
pedophilia and where you're talking
about babies,

3221
02:23:47,621 --> 02:23:49,780
which I think is probably even more
rare.

3222
02:23:50,530 --> 02:23:53,710
Someone fucking young boys.
Yeah.

3223
02:23:53,830 --> 02:23:56,980
But it's,
it's a very bizarre part of our human

3224
02:23:56,981 --> 02:23:58,450
history.
Very bizarre.

3225
02:23:58,451 --> 02:24:03,250
And it makes you wonder how much of that
sexual abuse gets somehow or another

3226
02:24:03,251 --> 02:24:07,330
transferred from a child being abused to
that child growing up,

3227
02:24:07,331 --> 02:24:09,220
becoming an adult and becoming an abuser
themselves.

3228
02:24:09,860 --> 02:24:12,100
What it,
is it a cancer of ideas?

3229
02:24:12,280 --> 02:24:15,790
Is it a dizzy,
almost like a sexual disease that gets

3230
02:24:15,791 --> 02:24:20,140
spread from perpetrator to victim?
The victim becomes perpetrator,

3231
02:24:20,260 --> 02:24:21,340
makes new victims.

3232
02:24:21,390 --> 02:24:24,660
Well,
do you think it's the same act now as it

3233
02:24:24,661 --> 02:24:28,430
was back then?
Because it's more accepted back then it

3234
02:24:28,670 --> 02:24:30,030
back then.
So I wonder if,

3235
02:24:30,120 --> 02:24:33,890
I wonder if it wouldn't have been less,
I dunno,

3236
02:24:33,930 --> 02:24:35,400
maybe it's not less bad.
I'm trying to think.

3237
02:24:35,401 --> 02:24:37,350
I'm talking,
I'm talking now only about people who

3238
02:24:37,351 --> 02:24:38,310
are sexually immature.
Right?

3239
02:24:38,311 --> 02:24:41,250
So like someone who's like a 15 year old
catwalk model,

3240
02:24:41,520 --> 02:24:43,800
let's just,
let's assume that it's a woman who's

3241
02:24:43,890 --> 02:24:48,840
walking down the catwalks of Milan and
Paris and has what she thinks is a

3242
02:24:48,841 --> 02:24:53,070
consensual relationship with a 25 year
old fashion designer that's against the

3243
02:24:53,071 --> 02:24:58,071
law and it's regarded as being deeply on
ethical in our current society happened

3244
02:24:58,710 --> 02:25:00,390
all the time.
And other societies.

3245
02:25:00,440 --> 02:25:01,460
Yeah.
Um,

3246
02:25:01,890 --> 02:25:04,110
there's no,
I'm not saying that I think that the law

3247
02:25:04,111 --> 02:25:04,944
should be changed.
I dine,

3248
02:25:04,950 --> 02:25:07,170
I think it's good to have,
have laws against these things and I

3249
02:25:07,171 --> 02:25:09,300
don't think that it's ethically
defensible for people who are

3250
02:25:09,670 --> 02:25:11,640
significantly older,
um,

3251
02:25:11,670 --> 02:25:16,670
to assume that the person who is still
kind of evolving and still coming of age

3252
02:25:17,041 --> 02:25:18,720
is capable of giving proper consent.

3253
02:25:18,930 --> 02:25:20,670
Well,
it's illegal if to just three years

3254
02:25:20,671 --> 02:25:22,980
older.
That's where it gets really,

3255
02:25:23,230 --> 02:25:25,660
well that is weird.
That's chapel I think a week older.

3256
02:25:25,720 --> 02:25:26,441
Yeah,
exactly.

3257
02:25:26,441 --> 02:25:30,430
If they like 17 and 51 weeks and the
other person's 18 and one day it's

3258
02:25:30,431 --> 02:25:31,480
illegal.
That's stupid.

3259
02:25:31,481 --> 02:25:34,570
There's a Romeo and Juliet clause that
some countries have.

3260
02:25:34,571 --> 02:25:38,230
Like I think in the Netherlands it's not
against the law to have sex with people

3261
02:25:38,231 --> 02:25:41,170
even as young as 12 or 13 as long as if
you're 14.

3262
02:25:42,090 --> 02:25:43,600
Right.
Or like if you're like,

3263
02:25:45,340 --> 02:25:48,790
well what does the law to meditate if
you're 15 and your girlfriend's 14 does

3264
02:25:48,791 --> 02:25:50,620
that legal?
And I think it's the state by state

3265
02:25:50,621 --> 02:25:52,000
thing isn't it?
But that's a good question.

3266
02:25:52,001 --> 02:25:54,610
Is that what you would never be
prosecuted but the head,

3267
02:25:54,611 --> 02:25:58,750
there have been these,
we had cases where teenagers have been

3268
02:25:58,751 --> 02:26:01,750
prosecuted for high,
for having um,

3269
02:26:01,900 --> 02:26:04,120
like Dick pics,
all walls.

3270
02:26:04,570 --> 02:26:07,200
Not only their,
their boyfriends or girlfriends from,

3271
02:26:07,240 --> 02:26:11,110
I'm a big piece of they girlfriends
unless they're trans but of themselves.

3272
02:26:11,200 --> 02:26:14,830
And they've been prosecuted for child
porn because they're a child and they,

3273
02:26:14,910 --> 02:26:17,320
they holding pornography the whole bit
about it.

3274
02:26:17,560 --> 02:26:19,510
Yeah.
That whole bit about this colony.

3275
02:26:19,600 --> 02:26:20,500
Ridiculous.

3276
02:26:20,620 --> 02:26:21,730
Yeah.
They arrested her.

3277
02:26:22,060 --> 02:26:26,260
She was a sending boys' pictures of her
pussy and they arrested her for child

3278
02:26:26,261 --> 02:26:27,730
pornography.
She was 15 years old.

3279
02:26:29,380 --> 02:26:32,320
Yeah.
I mean that's a weird use of the law.

3280
02:26:32,680 --> 02:26:34,930
You know,
like if she's sending it to other girls

3281
02:26:34,931 --> 02:26:37,830
and boys that are her age,
it's not your business.

3282
02:26:37,870 --> 02:26:40,810
Who are you protecting her in jail?
No one.

3283
02:26:40,990 --> 02:26:42,040
But it's a,
it's a,

3284
02:26:42,041 --> 02:26:45,430
an ability what?
When you give someone a game called

3285
02:26:45,431 --> 02:26:48,120
arrest people that are doing bad,
this is,

3286
02:26:48,170 --> 02:26:49,750
here's the law.
If they don't,

3287
02:26:49,780 --> 02:26:53,710
they don't follow by the byline's.
You're allowed to lock them in a cage

3288
02:26:53,770 --> 02:26:56,380
and this is your job.
You're allowed to do that end.

3289
02:26:57,040 --> 02:26:58,960
I want you to rest a certain amount of
people per month,

3290
02:26:58,990 --> 02:27:00,240
otherwise you're fucked.
Yeah.

3291
02:27:00,430 --> 02:27:02,600
I mean that's the issue with quotas and,
and,

3292
02:27:02,680 --> 02:27:03,520
and police.

3293
02:27:03,780 --> 02:27:04,613
Yeah.
Yeah.

3294
02:27:04,940 --> 02:27:07,490
I mean it's almost like I come in,
but who I heard saying this the other

3295
02:27:07,490 --> 02:27:10,490
day,
that police used to go out and catch bad

3296
02:27:10,491 --> 02:27:14,900
guys and like solve crimes,
but now we've sort of outsourced it to

3297
02:27:14,901 --> 02:27:18,290
police the job of just making everything
kind of Nice.

3298
02:27:18,460 --> 02:27:20,860
Well,
police are glorified revenue collectors

3299
02:27:20,861 --> 02:27:22,390
and a lot of ways,
I mean,

3300
02:27:22,391 --> 02:27:25,780
why,
why are they giving people tickets for

3301
02:27:26,030 --> 02:27:28,210
certain traffic violations?
Yeah.

3302
02:27:28,630 --> 02:27:30,450
I mean the smoking a plant.
Yeah.

3303
02:27:30,520 --> 02:27:33,480
There's a lot of things that people get
arrested for where this,

3304
02:27:33,490 --> 02:27:35,890
they're essentially just providing money
to the system.

3305
02:27:36,210 --> 02:27:36,851
You know,
they're not,

3306
02:27:36,851 --> 02:27:38,390
they're not serving,
you're protecting.

3307
02:27:38,720 --> 02:27:40,760
It's funny.
It's one of the things where when I talk

3308
02:27:40,761 --> 02:27:42,740
to Americans about the best things about
America,

3309
02:27:42,741 --> 02:27:45,110
the number one thing that Americans will
always say is freedom.

3310
02:27:45,170 --> 02:27:49,370
That this country represents freedom.
But the actual daily experience.

3311
02:27:49,580 --> 02:27:52,910
Like I've lived in New York and I've
lived in Copenhagen and I lived in,

3312
02:27:53,620 --> 02:27:55,970
uh,
in Australia and like the daily

3313
02:27:55,971 --> 02:27:58,940
experience of like,
I was standing outside my apartment in

3314
02:27:58,941 --> 02:28:02,540
New York drinking an open beverage,
uh,

3315
02:28:02,570 --> 02:28:07,070
just watching the world go by and a
couple of cops came over and one of them

3316
02:28:07,071 --> 02:28:08,390
was like,
Yo Watson,

3317
02:28:08,391 --> 02:28:10,430
the glass,
what's in the glass?

3318
02:28:10,431 --> 02:28:11,540
And I was like,
just soda.

3319
02:28:11,541 --> 02:28:13,430
It was fuck soda,
just soda.

3320
02:28:13,431 --> 02:28:15,110
And his,
his partner had to be like,

3321
02:28:15,140 --> 02:28:15,891
oh,
don't worry about it.

3322
02:28:15,891 --> 02:28:16,341
Like,
come on,

3323
02:28:16,341 --> 02:28:18,080
don't make a big deal out of it.
And they walked away.

3324
02:28:18,081 --> 02:28:22,250
But I was like,
go to a park in everyone's drinking

3325
02:28:22,250 --> 02:28:22,851
beer.
It's,

3326
02:28:22,851 --> 02:28:25,460
no,
they're not getting harassed by cops.

3327
02:28:25,490 --> 02:28:28,610
Isn't that a kind of freedom as well?
We're taking off their shirts and their

3328
02:28:28,611 --> 02:28:31,820
playing volleyball,
topless breasts hanging out.

3329
02:28:31,821 --> 02:28:34,760
You're talking about one specific area
because if you go to New Orleans,

3330
02:28:34,761 --> 02:28:36,300
people walked down the street drinking
all the time.

3331
02:28:36,320 --> 02:28:37,220
Yes.
And it's more free.

3332
02:28:37,221 --> 02:28:38,240
Yeah.
If you're in Vegas,

3333
02:28:38,241 --> 02:28:39,840
people walked on the stage second.
Yeah.

3334
02:28:40,080 --> 02:28:40,820
Yeah.
I mean,

3335
02:28:40,820 --> 02:28:42,880
is it better to live in Vegas or New
Orleans?

3336
02:28:42,890 --> 02:28:44,390
You know,
some people would say yes and other

3337
02:28:44,391 --> 02:28:46,550
people would say,
I don't want that for the children.

3338
02:28:46,580 --> 02:28:48,770
It's bad for the children that are
abort.

3339
02:28:49,690 --> 02:28:50,523
That's wrong.

3340
02:28:52,340 --> 02:28:53,270
I don't know,
man.

3341
02:28:53,320 --> 02:28:55,490
I,
I mean it's complex.

3342
02:28:55,520 --> 02:28:57,170
The,
all these issues are very complex.

3343
02:28:57,171 --> 02:29:00,560
It's like when,
when should you just let people run free

3344
02:29:00,561 --> 02:29:04,850
and ramp into the point where chaos and
suse and here's another problem then

3345
02:29:04,851 --> 02:29:07,280
that was talking about this with a
friend of mine the other day about North

3346
02:29:07,280 --> 02:29:08,510
Korea.
Um,

3347
02:29:09,050 --> 02:29:13,970
when people have become sort of
indoctrinated into a specific style of

3348
02:29:13,971 --> 02:29:16,610
life and behavior and then all of a
sudden you remove the rains.

3349
02:29:17,090 --> 02:29:21,020
Like when people who live in Kansas go
to Vegas and bay

3350
02:29:22,970 --> 02:29:25,310
as opposed to someone who grows up in
that environment.

3351
02:29:25,340 --> 02:29:28,460
Or like say we were,
we were looking at the North Korea

3352
02:29:28,461 --> 02:29:32,870
footage yesterday of them goose stepping
down the street and the giant throngs of

3353
02:29:32,871 --> 02:29:36,710
people who are following the orders and
doing the bidding of Kim Jong.

3354
02:29:36,780 --> 02:29:40,580
And we're saying like what would happen
to those people if you're a move this

3355
02:29:40,581 --> 02:29:43,370
military dictatorship gave them a
democratic life,

3356
02:29:43,371 --> 02:29:46,970
would they even be able to appreciate it
and understand it or are they so

3357
02:29:46,971 --> 02:29:51,020
institutionalized or they so
indoctrinated into this very specific

3358
02:29:51,021 --> 02:29:54,530
style of living in behavior that they
wouldn't be able to adjust?

3359
02:29:55,010 --> 02:29:57,080
Like I talked to Ron miscavige about
that,

3360
02:29:57,430 --> 02:29:59,330
you know,
who is he got out of scientology when he

3361
02:29:59,331 --> 02:30:03,560
was fucking 76 I mean stop and think
about that.

3362
02:30:03,561 --> 02:30:08,561
The guy got in in 1970 and got out in
2012 live the bulk of his life in this

3363
02:30:09,771 --> 02:30:14,750
really bizarre environment and now all
of a sudden he's a free man.

3364
02:30:15,110 --> 02:30:17,450
I think that's right.
And this is one of my concerns about,

3365
02:30:17,510 --> 02:30:20,090
about laws that prevent people from
doing things.

3366
02:30:20,480 --> 02:30:25,160
This is why I'm sort of libertarian ish
when it comes to non economic cultural

3367
02:30:25,161 --> 02:30:28,610
issues because I actually think you need
to inculcate in people and experience of

3368
02:30:28,611 --> 02:30:31,610
showing restraint on the bus by
themselves.

3369
02:30:31,611 --> 02:30:34,200
Because if the law is does it for you,
you,

3370
02:30:34,380 --> 02:30:36,290
you,
you then remove the laws and all of a

3371
02:30:36,291 --> 02:30:37,730
sudden everyone goes crazy.
It's a bit,

3372
02:30:37,760 --> 02:30:39,710
you know,
you can imagine that if all of a sudden

3373
02:30:39,711 --> 02:30:43,490
street drinking were permitted in New
York that people will be vomiting all

3374
02:30:43,491 --> 02:30:46,310
over the place and like getting,
getting drunk because they've been so

3375
02:30:46,311 --> 02:30:49,730
used to so acclimated to never being
allowed to do it.

3376
02:30:49,730 --> 02:30:53,260
That now it's the forbidden fruit.
Go and just get smashed in the past

3377
02:30:53,300 --> 02:30:54,830
because that's what we can,
we can do now.

3378
02:30:54,860 --> 02:30:56,690
Well,
do you know about Amish Amish?

3379
02:30:56,720 --> 02:30:57,810
Yeah.
Rubber spring.

3380
02:30:57,850 --> 02:30:59,240
Yeah.
When they get to do that,

3381
02:30:59,241 --> 02:31:01,910
what was the hell's playground?
Is that the documentary in the Senate?

3382
02:31:01,980 --> 02:31:04,080
There's a great documentary about it.
And these,

3383
02:31:04,081 --> 02:31:07,160
these people,
they have this period of time where

3384
02:31:07,161 --> 02:31:09,290
they're allowed to do whatever the fuck
they want.

3385
02:31:09,291 --> 02:31:11,200
It's basically when they come maintains,
right,

3386
02:31:11,210 --> 02:31:11,611
they,
they,

3387
02:31:11,611 --> 02:31:14,150
they let loose from the amish
communities and they were allowed to

3388
02:31:14,420 --> 02:31:18,110
indulge jay go hog wild hog where they
go,

3389
02:31:18,111 --> 02:31:19,980
they party fucking hard and then they
have to

3390
02:31:19,980 --> 02:31:22,170
figure out whether or not they want to
go back to being amish.

3391
02:31:22,270 --> 02:31:23,740
Hmm.
And most of them do.

3392
02:31:23,800 --> 02:31:24,760
Yeah.
Strange.

3393
02:31:24,790 --> 02:31:28,900
It's interesting that you used the word
institutions joe to describing like

3394
02:31:28,901 --> 02:31:32,410
North Korea because I think this is
another thing that I'm so grateful about

3395
02:31:32,680 --> 02:31:36,250
America for and why I'm sort of
optimistic that trump is not going to

3396
02:31:36,251 --> 02:31:41,251
destroy this,
this country that institutions like this

3397
02:31:42,701 --> 02:31:44,260
sounds like such a valley girl thing to
say.

3398
02:31:44,261 --> 02:31:46,220
I was going to say institutions like
really matter

3399
02:31:53,470 --> 02:31:55,440
but,
but it's,

3400
02:31:55,450 --> 02:31:58,030
but it's true.
You look at places like Hungary and what

3401
02:31:58,031 --> 02:32:02,260
we've just seen happen in Turkey and in
Russia,

3402
02:32:02,261 --> 02:32:05,740
in Venezuela.
And it's much easier for people there

3403
02:32:05,741 --> 02:32:08,500
who are corrupt or who would like to,
to,

3404
02:32:08,990 --> 02:32:12,430
um,
to bring people under their spell to do

3405
02:32:12,431 --> 02:32:17,290
so because there aren't these big robust
divided institutions like the press

3406
02:32:17,470 --> 02:32:21,160
being fiercely independent,
the judicial system being fiercely

3407
02:32:21,340 --> 02:32:22,590
independent,
uh,

3408
02:32:22,810 --> 02:32:26,650
Congress and the executive hopefully
hating each other just enough to keep

3409
02:32:26,680 --> 02:32:29,050
each other in check,
keep themselves in check.

3410
02:32:29,350 --> 02:32:30,450
And also just the,
the,

3411
02:32:30,460 --> 02:32:33,510
the traditions of American life where
there's,

3412
02:32:33,550 --> 02:32:37,810
there's I think more acceptance of
descent and of weirdness than there are

3413
02:32:37,811 --> 02:32:40,930
in those other places.
Like Russians are just very,

3414
02:32:41,050 --> 02:32:44,530
I don't want to generalize here,
but allow me to conformist people,

3415
02:32:44,560 --> 02:32:48,010
like they've lived under csas and
fucking empires for centuries and

3416
02:32:48,011 --> 02:32:50,530
millennia.
Like they like following strong men.

3417
02:32:50,531 --> 02:32:53,080
Americans aren't like that.
And some of them are,

3418
02:32:53,081 --> 02:32:56,170
there is this kind of militaristic
jingoistic side to America,

3419
02:32:56,171 --> 02:33:00,070
which is very kind of like salute the
flag and like say yes please.

3420
02:33:00,071 --> 02:33:02,140
Like you got to honor the honor,
the veterans and everything.

3421
02:33:03,020 --> 02:33:03,851
But yeah,
but yeah,

3422
02:33:03,851 --> 02:33:05,800
exactly.
Respect the office or like kind of

3423
02:33:05,801 --> 02:33:08,710
stuff.
And I think that way tyranny lies.

3424
02:33:08,820 --> 02:33:11,140
I think the best,
the best thing as a mayor that America

3425
02:33:11,141 --> 02:33:14,170
has ever kind of given the world is its
flamboyant,

3426
02:33:14,171 --> 02:33:17,560
boisterous sense of possibility and
craziness that expresses itself in

3427
02:33:17,561 --> 02:33:20,530
Silicon Valley.
And maybe Peter Teal who I might not

3428
02:33:20,531 --> 02:33:23,200
like,
but at least he's unusual in Hollywood.

3429
02:33:23,890 --> 02:33:26,140
You know,
even in Wall Street there are a whole

3430
02:33:26,141 --> 02:33:28,690
bunch of,
there's just an excitement in this

3431
02:33:28,691 --> 02:33:29,524
place,
which,

3432
02:33:29,530 --> 02:33:33,580
which seeps out in so many different
ways in America that I think to try to

3433
02:33:33,581 --> 02:33:36,070
corral it as a dictator would be like
herding cats.

3434
02:33:36,100 --> 02:33:37,540
Like it'll just never,
you know,

3435
02:33:37,541 --> 02:33:38,740
it'll never,
it'll never quite right.

3436
02:33:39,020 --> 02:33:41,180
Well we can only hope because if trump
has his way,

3437
02:33:41,181 --> 02:33:44,150
he would definitely try to do that.
He would try to get all these people to

3438
02:33:44,151 --> 02:33:47,030
do his bidding and figure out some way
to dismantle all of these different

3439
02:33:47,031 --> 02:33:51,080
institutions and make it much easier for
him to make America great again and just

3440
02:33:51,081 --> 02:33:52,800
fucking force that agenda through.
Yeah.

3441
02:33:52,850 --> 02:33:54,080
I don't,
didn't think he would think that he's

3442
02:33:54,081 --> 02:33:54,950
doing the wrong thing.
Woody.

3443
02:33:55,160 --> 02:33:56,330
I don't know.
Do you think,

3444
02:33:56,390 --> 02:33:58,760
I mean he said he admires Putin.
I mean,

3445
02:33:58,761 --> 02:34:00,770
which is very bizarre.
I mean,

3446
02:34:00,771 --> 02:34:04,190
it's very bizarre.
And when he compared what Putin does to

3447
02:34:04,191 --> 02:34:06,080
what we do,
that we do terrible things to like,

3448
02:34:06,470 --> 02:34:07,760
whoa,
that's crazy.

3449
02:34:07,940 --> 02:34:10,970
That guy murders people on the street.
I mean he,

3450
02:34:10,971 --> 02:34:13,250
any political opposition,
he fucking kills them.

3451
02:34:13,251 --> 02:34:15,950
He kills reporters mean or somebody
does,

3452
02:34:16,130 --> 02:34:18,400
I don't know if it's him or somebody
does

3453
02:34:18,400 --> 02:34:22,990
right outside the Kremlin.
A W know on the main bridge leading to

3454
02:34:22,991 --> 02:34:26,910
the Kremlin at night and all of the
security cameras from the Kremlin

3455
02:34:26,920 --> 02:34:30,820
happened to go off and have their
footage missing just when the murder,

3456
02:34:31,190 --> 02:34:33,370
it's insane.
The amount of power that he wields.

3457
02:34:33,371 --> 02:34:34,390
His stunning.
Yeah.

3458
02:34:34,750 --> 02:34:38,590
If someone on the left in America said,
Oh,

3459
02:34:38,591 --> 02:34:41,290
who's who?
Who are we to say that Putin is a bad

3460
02:34:41,291 --> 02:34:42,640
guy?
I think of all the bad things that

3461
02:34:42,641 --> 02:34:46,930
America's done
just

3462
02:34:48,690 --> 02:34:52,000
right.
That's a kind of Noam Chomsky thing to

3463
02:34:52,001 --> 02:34:55,990
say,
America's America's chickens are coming

3464
02:34:55,991 --> 02:34:58,580
home to roost.
We did this in Vietnam and now so you

3465
02:34:58,581 --> 02:35:00,670
know when I better than Putin,
fuck that.

3466
02:35:00,700 --> 02:35:02,290
I mean,
it's the right that's supposed to

3467
02:35:02,291 --> 02:35:05,020
believe in American exceptionalism.
Just not trump.

3468
02:35:05,021 --> 02:35:07,750
Isn't that well,
he's got a very bizarre interests in

3469
02:35:07,751 --> 02:35:10,450
Russia and that's one of the reasons I
think why he was want to release his

3470
02:35:10,451 --> 02:35:11,110
taxes.

3471
02:35:11,110 --> 02:35:15,220
The real,
the real question is how much money does

3472
02:35:15,221 --> 02:35:18,550
he have invested in Russia?
Like how much,

3473
02:35:18,580 --> 02:35:21,250
how much financial influence do they
have on him?

3474
02:35:21,460 --> 02:35:26,460
I wonder if part of it is when he says
that he admired someone like Putin,

3475
02:35:27,010 --> 02:35:32,010
if it's just his sort of constitutional
sense that he kind of likes a strong

3476
02:35:32,171 --> 02:35:33,850
man,
like his isn't his whole life sort of

3477
02:35:33,851 --> 02:35:36,790
about I am powerful,
I am rich,

3478
02:35:37,360 --> 02:35:40,780
you know you're going to kneel before me
and people who can pull that off.

3479
02:35:41,140 --> 02:35:44,590
I think just resonate with him in some
way that's more so I've always found

3480
02:35:44,591 --> 02:35:49,591
like the how much money does they have
invested in Russia question somewhat

3481
02:35:50,021 --> 02:35:53,440
less interesting to me.
Then why does he want to suck Putin's

3482
02:35:53,441 --> 02:35:56,980
Dixon Ma,
you know like is it the whole mean

3483
02:35:56,981 --> 02:35:59,620
interpretation,
a convenient interpretation of what

3484
02:35:59,621 --> 02:36:02,200
Putin represents because he doesn't
really have time to look at all these

3485
02:36:02,201 --> 02:36:03,034
different things.

3486
02:36:03,070 --> 02:36:04,480
You know,
it was revealed the other day that he's

3487
02:36:04,481 --> 02:36:07,250
not really aware that Kim Jong loons.
Dot.

3488
02:36:07,300 --> 02:36:09,270
Kim Jong Il.
Did you see that?

3489
02:36:09,290 --> 02:36:11,710
It is confusing.
There are too many Kim's in the careers,

3490
02:36:11,740 --> 02:36:16,740
but you did not say that
there's like this ridiculous thing where

3491
02:36:16,931 --> 02:36:20,530
he was talking about this gentleman,
he was talking about Kim Jong and he was

3492
02:36:20,531 --> 02:36:25,050
referring to conversations that Kim Jong
Il has had with Bush and I mean the

3493
02:36:25,090 --> 02:36:27,100
whole thing.
I think there's too many things to focus

3494
02:36:27,101 --> 02:36:32,101
on and he's so fucking busy with himself
and his business interests and the

3495
02:36:32,531 --> 02:36:35,110
things that he's trying to push through
and we're going to Exxon mobile and all

3496
02:36:35,111 --> 02:36:37,180
these different subsidiaries that he's
kind of invested in.

3497
02:36:37,480 --> 02:36:42,250
He's got his fucking fingers in so many
different pies and he's also just not

3498
02:36:42,251 --> 02:36:46,990
interested in the affairs of state.
He doesn't care about foreign policy and

3499
02:36:46,991 --> 02:36:48,280
stuff like it's,
it's a little bit,

3500
02:36:48,281 --> 02:36:49,860
he doesn't like learning and stuff.
He doesn't like it.

3501
02:36:49,861 --> 02:36:53,380
He's not a good reader or what's one of
the big concerns is that he's not

3502
02:36:53,381 --> 02:36:57,100
concerned with foreign policy to the
point where he's putting off all these

3503
02:36:57,101 --> 02:37:00,160
things and letting the military do their
job in quotes.

3504
02:37:00,161 --> 02:37:03,520
Did you see the point that he didn't
even authorize the mother of all bombs

3505
02:37:03,521 --> 02:37:05,290
when it was dropped on Afghanistan last
week?

3506
02:37:05,291 --> 02:37:08,440
The military,
the option to do what they think is

3507
02:37:08,441 --> 02:37:11,290
right.
And that's what Eisenhower warned about

3508
02:37:11,291 --> 02:37:12,310
when he left on.
That's right.

3509
02:37:12,550 --> 02:37:15,980
But in some crazy way,
don't you feel more safe

3510
02:37:16,010 --> 02:37:19,550
with the military doing it then with
trump doing it in some way?

3511
02:37:19,551 --> 02:37:20,540
Yes,
absolutely.

3512
02:37:20,600 --> 02:37:23,030
Well,
I think there's a real argument that the

3513
02:37:23,031 --> 02:37:28,031
military has been,
that they've been held back to the Paul.

3514
02:37:29,100 --> 02:37:30,080
They have,
I mean,

3515
02:37:30,081 --> 02:37:31,370
look,
you're engaging in war,

3516
02:37:31,371 --> 02:37:33,450
right?
And that there's a real argument that

3517
02:37:33,451 --> 02:37:37,430
the people in the military make that
people die because they're forced to

3518
02:37:37,431 --> 02:37:41,000
take too many steps before they get
clearance to do something when they're

3519
02:37:41,001 --> 02:37:45,050
being attacked.
And so their argument is it's better to

3520
02:37:45,051 --> 02:37:48,230
let people who really understand war
engage in more,

3521
02:37:48,770 --> 02:37:51,110
but then there's the eisenhower argument
that,

3522
02:37:51,300 --> 02:37:54,680
well,
you're dealing with an institution like

3523
02:37:54,681 --> 02:37:58,700
the military industrial complex.
You're dealing with a l I can think of

3524
02:37:58,701 --> 02:38:02,230
it as an organism that survives on war
it,

3525
02:38:02,270 --> 02:38:06,410
there's a tremendous amount of money
that gets pumped into this,

3526
02:38:06,500 --> 02:38:08,690
this thing that this war machine.

3527
02:38:08,690 --> 02:38:09,440
Yep.
Right.

3528
02:38:09,440 --> 02:38:12,010
And then what does it want to do?
It wants to fucking use all the

3529
02:38:12,020 --> 02:38:13,580
statistics that a war.
That's right.

3530
02:38:14,510 --> 02:38:16,820
Have you noticed how the the military
contractors,

3531
02:38:16,821 --> 02:38:20,150
if you looked at how,
how delicately spread out around America

3532
02:38:20,151 --> 02:38:23,930
that like they have plants in almost
every single state so that there's

3533
02:38:23,931 --> 02:38:28,040
always a congressperson or a senator who
are the military contractors can call up

3534
02:38:28,041 --> 02:38:28,950
and be like,
well you,

3535
02:38:28,951 --> 02:38:31,640
you're going to lose like 70,000 jobs in
this little,

3536
02:38:31,760 --> 02:38:34,340
of course shit.
Potel it'd actually be more,

3537
02:38:34,341 --> 02:38:36,950
it would make more economic sense for
them to have consolidated their

3538
02:38:36,951 --> 02:38:40,340
operations and be making all the
submarines and warships in the same

3539
02:38:40,341 --> 02:38:41,000
place,
but they don't.

3540
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:43,430
They make one widget in Delaware,
then make another one over here.

3541
02:38:43,431 --> 02:38:45,560
Another one over here.
It's very select got congressman.

3542
02:38:45,640 --> 02:38:47,270
Yeah.
No one's ever going to want that plant

3543
02:38:47,271 --> 02:38:48,104
to close.

3544
02:38:48,650 --> 02:38:51,470
It's like mudgee things that we've
talked about today.

3545
02:38:51,890 --> 02:38:55,820
There's super complicated and there's so
many different things to consider and

3546
02:38:55,821 --> 02:38:59,900
it's no real one black and white answer
when when you're dealing with so many

3547
02:38:59,901 --> 02:39:03,410
factions in so many variables and so
many things.

3548
02:39:03,800 --> 02:39:07,190
That's one of the reasons why being a
president is a preposterous idea.

3549
02:39:07,890 --> 02:39:09,380
Is it?
It's stupid.

3550
02:39:09,710 --> 02:39:10,760
It's stupid,
isn't it?

3551
02:39:10,880 --> 02:39:14,660
If I have too much power,
I mean you talk about black and white

3552
02:39:14,810 --> 02:39:19,610
and you like shades of gray.
How do you negotiate with the North

3553
02:39:19,610 --> 02:39:23,000
Koreans and the South Koreans and the
Chinese and the Japanese and the

3554
02:39:23,001 --> 02:39:28,001
Russians about what to do about Syria?
We'll show a Syria.

3555
02:39:28,160 --> 02:39:29,130
Yeah.
Shit.

3556
02:39:29,150 --> 02:39:32,270
I mean in some ways.
What did you think of the tree of trump

3557
02:39:32,510 --> 02:39:35,150
hitting Syria?
Well,

3558
02:39:35,330 --> 02:39:36,440
no one died,
right?

3559
02:39:36,680 --> 02:39:39,470
What he did was attack airfields and
blew up airfields.

3560
02:39:39,471 --> 02:39:40,910
It was a show of force,
you know,

3561
02:39:40,911 --> 02:39:41,930
is it the right thing to do?

3562
02:39:41,940 --> 02:39:42,780
Shit.
I don't,

3563
02:39:42,860 --> 02:39:43,950
I don't know.
Um,

3564
02:39:44,040 --> 02:39:48,890
I don't understand exactly what is
accomplished other than you blow up an

3565
02:39:48,891 --> 02:39:50,780
airfield and have to rebuild it.
I mean,

3566
02:39:50,781 --> 02:39:53,960
you show people that you can do that,
but we already knew you could do that.

3567
02:39:54,200 --> 02:39:57,500
You show people you're willing to act.
I mean,

3568
02:39:57,501 --> 02:40:02,501
back in 2012 and 2013 I thought that
Obama flubbed it by saying that we

3569
02:40:05,571 --> 02:40:09,500
wouldn't tolerate the use of chemical
weapons and then doing nothing when

3570
02:40:09,501 --> 02:40:13,100
reaction by the right and the left
people were very weird war back.

3571
02:40:13,140 --> 02:40:15,210
Absolutely.
I think they've relaxed a little over

3572
02:40:15,211 --> 02:40:15,960
that.
Yeah.

3573
02:40:15,960 --> 02:40:18,210
When will willing to to go in and get a
break.

3574
02:40:18,270 --> 02:40:18,980
Yeah,
exactly.

3575
02:40:18,980 --> 02:40:19,860
Hold on,
I'm going back in.

3576
02:40:20,700 --> 02:40:21,241
It's like,
you know,

3577
02:40:21,241 --> 02:40:23,300
when you go in the pool,
you swim for a while,

3578
02:40:23,310 --> 02:40:25,730
then I come back out again.
I want to get cool again without,

3579
02:40:25,780 --> 02:40:27,340
with a nice foreign war.
Yeah.

3580
02:40:27,480 --> 02:40:29,910
There was Vietnam and we didn't like
that and then we can forget it,

3581
02:40:29,960 --> 02:40:32,060
bad it long enough.
So we did it rock and we didn't like

3582
02:40:32,061 --> 02:40:33,530
that.
But now that's kind of fading,

3583
02:40:33,531 --> 02:40:35,660
receding into the,
into the distant past as well.

3584
02:40:36,230 --> 02:40:37,810
But I,
yeah,

3585
02:40:37,860 --> 02:40:40,580
I,
I actually interviewed Phil Donahue on

3586
02:40:40,610 --> 02:40:44,390
huffpost live because he was a very
outspoken antiwar critic.

3587
02:40:44,600 --> 02:40:46,250
And I was saying at the time,
like,

3588
02:40:46,280 --> 02:40:48,470
can't we be nuanced enough to make a
difference,

3589
02:40:48,471 --> 02:40:51,110
but to understand the difference between
the Iraq war,

3590
02:40:51,320 --> 02:40:56,320
a full scale invasion based on a
misunderstanding or a misleading

3591
02:40:57,411 --> 02:41:00,020
interpretation of what Iraq's
capabilities.

3592
02:41:00,021 --> 02:41:00,860
And it's mean,
it's,

3593
02:41:01,200 --> 02:41:02,780
um,
weapons program was,

3594
02:41:03,230 --> 02:41:08,230
and this Syrian problem,
which is a horrifying civil war where a

3595
02:41:08,751 --> 02:41:12,740
dictator is gassing his own people and
we didn't want to invade,

3596
02:41:13,100 --> 02:41:16,630
but drawing some kind of a line in the
sand and saying,

3597
02:41:16,640 --> 02:41:21,050
you can't do that in the 21st century.
You can't just be dropping gas canisters

3598
02:41:21,051 --> 02:41:21,650
on kids.

3599
02:41:21,650 --> 02:41:25,670
So they bleed out their eyes and like
cough up their own lungs.

3600
02:41:25,671 --> 02:41:29,280
That's not a way to behave in the United
States as an exceptional nation.

3601
02:41:29,281 --> 02:41:31,340
And we'll do something about that.
You're right.

3602
02:41:31,341 --> 02:41:34,940
That about it really had his hands tied
because he went to Congress and Congress

3603
02:41:34,941 --> 02:41:39,200
didn't give him the power to do it,
but I kind of felt somehow sort of

3604
02:41:39,201 --> 02:41:42,260
slightly vindicated when trump did it.
Like I was not one of the people on the

3605
02:41:42,261 --> 02:41:43,820
left who was like,
oh my goodness,

3606
02:41:43,821 --> 02:41:44,960
what's he doing?
I was like,

3607
02:41:44,980 --> 02:41:45,420
well,
okay.

3608
02:41:45,420 --> 02:41:48,110
I mean at least that's a,
at least it's something

3609
02:41:48,350 --> 02:41:50,630
I agree.
But it's also an incredibly complicated

3610
02:41:50,631 --> 02:41:54,680
situation because Assad is against Isis.

3611
02:41:55,740 --> 02:41:56,350
Okay?

3612
02:41:56,350 --> 02:41:58,360
Superficially,
yes,

3613
02:42:00,150 --> 02:42:00,983
but

3614
02:42:02,280 --> 02:42:07,280
he uses isis as an excuse to be able to
target all of his political opponents.

3615
02:42:08,970 --> 02:42:11,660
It's too much.
It's too twice.

3616
02:42:12,710 --> 02:42:16,350
It's two twice dead end.
There's no way to get rid of isis

3617
02:42:16,560 --> 02:42:21,560
without getting rid of Assad because the
locals in Syria who will lift height

3618
02:42:21,751 --> 02:42:22,800
Assad,
who would,

3619
02:42:22,801 --> 02:42:25,290
who are anti Assad,
they hate aside even more than they hate

3620
02:42:25,291 --> 02:42:28,140
isis.
So as long as Assad is there,

3621
02:42:28,320 --> 02:42:30,210
they're going to give isis their
sympathies.

3622
02:42:30,450 --> 02:42:32,910
So this idea of like,
I mean,

3623
02:42:32,911 --> 02:42:36,150
basically the whole isis thing I think
is just a smokescreen to allow Putin and

3624
02:42:36,151 --> 02:42:39,390
Assad to crackdown on dissidents.

3625
02:42:39,630 --> 02:42:43,320
But isn't it also like a lot of the same
issues that they faced when they

3626
02:42:43,321 --> 02:42:47,190
dethroned Khadafi in Libya you create
this to happen.

3627
02:42:47,220 --> 02:42:48,620
Exactly.
I think it's too late.

3628
02:42:48,810 --> 02:42:49,770
Failed State.
Yeah.

3629
02:42:49,771 --> 02:42:52,650
I think we've missed the,
we missed the boat in Syria or what the

3630
02:42:52,651 --> 02:42:53,790
fuck,
what do we do?

3631
02:42:53,820 --> 02:42:56,640
President Josh Zaps?
What do we do?

3632
02:42:56,670 --> 02:42:58,610
We build a time machine,
Joe and uh,

3633
02:42:58,620 --> 02:43:02,930
we go back to 2012 there's not much you
can do that.

3634
02:43:02,950 --> 02:43:04,620
And I did.
They probably wasn't even much we could

3635
02:43:04,621 --> 02:43:06,060
do.
Do you think you can imagine,

3636
02:43:06,090 --> 02:43:08,550
oh wait,
you should have like one president that

3637
02:43:08,551 --> 02:43:12,280
deals with just Syria.
Like that should be your 100% that's

3638
02:43:12,281 --> 02:43:14,350
right.
The idea of having a president that also

3639
02:43:14,351 --> 02:43:19,351
deals with Exxon Mobil and BP and then
also was talking to the coal people and

3640
02:43:19,631 --> 02:43:21,860
also is talking to the people in Silicon
Valley.

3641
02:43:21,880 --> 02:43:24,070
You know why you haven't administration,
right.

3642
02:43:24,070 --> 02:43:24,720
I mean,
so the,

3643
02:43:24,720 --> 02:43:27,820
the secretary of State is broadly
overseeing it and then they will have a

3644
02:43:27,821 --> 02:43:30,300
special envoy to the Middle East who
should be split,

3645
02:43:30,310 --> 02:43:33,850
who is basically as the president of the
president of the United States for

3646
02:43:33,851 --> 02:43:34,930
Syria.
Yeah.

3647
02:43:34,931 --> 02:43:37,960
And then Sean Spicer's in,
in charge of cleaning up lies.

3648
02:43:38,020 --> 02:43:39,910
I mean that's what he's using
alternative facts.

3649
02:43:39,911 --> 02:43:43,780
President.
Do you think that that the world would

3650
02:43:43,781 --> 02:43:48,781
be better or worse off if America had
just stayed completely out of the Middle

3651
02:43:48,910 --> 02:43:52,450
East from like the end of the Cold War
on,

3652
02:43:52,720 --> 02:43:55,960
I don't know.
And I don't know how you fix the problem

3653
02:43:55,990 --> 02:43:58,780
of military dictatorships.
How do you,

3654
02:43:58,900 --> 02:44:00,820
how do you stop that?
How do you overthrow them?

3655
02:44:00,821 --> 02:44:04,270
I mean the CIA has been battling that
for years.

3656
02:44:04,390 --> 02:44:06,190
I mean,
they will propping them up or propping

3657
02:44:06,191 --> 02:44:09,370
them up or propping them up and shooting
them down or you know,

3658
02:44:09,371 --> 02:44:14,050
trying to keep that issue over there and
keeping them from becoming big enough

3659
02:44:14,051 --> 02:44:16,990
where they spread to the point where
they become another Nazi Germany or what

3660
02:44:16,991 --> 02:44:17,824
have you.

3661
02:44:17,920 --> 02:44:20,700
It's a really good question and I'm too
fucking stupid to give you an answer.

3662
02:44:22,150 --> 02:44:23,020
I mean,
who knows.

3663
02:44:23,021 --> 02:44:25,660
I mean look,
it's just disturbing that something like

3664
02:44:25,661 --> 02:44:29,860
North Korea can exist in 2017.
I want to go,

3665
02:44:29,890 --> 02:44:32,560
I really want to go to North Korea.
I think it'd be fascinating.

3666
02:44:33,100 --> 02:44:35,440
Really.
Yeah.

3667
02:44:35,530 --> 02:44:38,410
Cause it's like the last kind of hermit
kingdom lift.

3668
02:44:38,411 --> 02:44:42,910
It's the last true Soviet era.
Communist dictatorship.

3669
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:44,750
You can probably control.
Yeah.

3670
02:44:44,770 --> 02:44:46,090
I think you can.
I mean,

3671
02:44:46,091 --> 02:44:48,820
but the problem is you have to be kind
of um,

3672
02:44:49,130 --> 02:44:51,670
you know,
accompanied by a Chaperon who works for

3673
02:44:51,671 --> 02:44:54,070
the government who only shows you the
things that the government wants you to

3674
02:44:54,071 --> 02:44:55,420
say.
Henry Rollins went,

3675
02:44:55,690 --> 02:44:57,460
that's right.
He to died show.

3676
02:44:57,710 --> 02:44:59,770
Yeah.
That's so gangster.

3677
02:44:59,860 --> 02:45:02,380
He's so good.
I was in New Zealand actually listening

3678
02:45:02,381 --> 02:45:07,240
to your epis to that episode at the,
at the lounge in Oakland airport,

3679
02:45:07,241 --> 02:45:09,520
coming back to Australia a couple of
months ago.

3680
02:45:09,730 --> 02:45:12,970
And Henry was really inspiring to me in
that episode because it made me realize

3681
02:45:12,971 --> 02:45:13,781
like,
yeah,

3682
02:45:13,781 --> 02:45:16,810
just because I'm getting old and like
I'm going to be a dad and everything

3683
02:45:16,811 --> 02:45:18,790
doesn't mean you have to lose your sense
of adventure.

3684
02:45:18,791 --> 02:45:22,090
That dude is bad ass.
He's got a hundred percent sense of

3685
02:45:22,091 --> 02:45:24,130
adventure to the point where he won't
have a relationship.

3686
02:45:24,640 --> 02:45:25,480
He's like,
it's not,

3687
02:45:25,510 --> 02:45:27,340
it's not worth it.
It's just too much work.

3688
02:45:27,520 --> 02:45:31,480
But he's also an interesting case study
in giving kids medication,

3689
02:45:31,481 --> 02:45:34,300
a very early age.
He was one of the very early Prozac

3690
02:45:34,301 --> 02:45:35,410
kids.
Oh really?

3691
02:45:35,440 --> 02:45:36,630
Yeah.
They are Ritalin rather.

3692
02:45:36,810 --> 02:45:37,643
Yeah,
they hooked him up.

3693
02:45:37,690 --> 02:45:40,090
They hooked him up with Ritalin when he
was fucking five years old,

3694
02:45:40,091 --> 02:45:43,200
man,
from five years old to high school.

3695
02:45:43,280 --> 02:45:45,040
How does he feel about that now?
Terrible.

3696
02:45:45,041 --> 02:45:47,440
I mean he just described it like it's
horrible,

3697
02:45:47,441 --> 02:45:50,620
like he's white knuckled his way through
the day and the end of the day the

3698
02:45:50,621 --> 02:45:54,160
Ritalin would wear off and he'd be
exhausted and we'd go through class.

3699
02:45:55,600 --> 02:45:59,740
I mean that's a good chunk of his
intense personality and behavior has to

3700
02:45:59,741 --> 02:46:02,240
do with him being raised on speed.
Yeah,

3701
02:46:02,690 --> 02:46:05,200
just crazy.
It's funny how it has a different impact

3702
02:46:05,201 --> 02:46:07,390
on people who have add and then people
who don't.

3703
02:46:07,530 --> 02:46:08,590
Right.
It doesn't us.

3704
02:46:08,640 --> 02:46:09,980
Yeah.
Well what is add,

3705
02:46:10,040 --> 02:46:11,210
you know what I mean?
It's a real thing,

3706
02:46:11,211 --> 02:46:15,350
but how does it manifest itself in a
person and how does it manifest in a

3707
02:46:15,351 --> 02:46:20,351
person that is formed in this
environment where they're forced to be

3708
02:46:20,721 --> 02:46:24,530
in is a rigid,
controlled social experiment called

3709
02:46:24,531 --> 02:46:25,800
school.
That's right.

3710
02:46:25,860 --> 02:46:27,950
And why do we have classroom?
Why don't we,

3711
02:46:28,070 --> 02:46:31,490
it has to be 30 people and they all have
to be sitting in a row.

3712
02:46:31,580 --> 02:46:34,910
And then he said,
program you to have a regular job that

3713
02:46:34,911 --> 02:46:35,860
you don't have.
Yeah,

3714
02:46:35,870 --> 02:46:37,370
I don't have,
he doesn't have,

3715
02:46:37,580 --> 02:46:40,700
there's a lot of people that don't have
jobs where you have to work in a fucking

3716
02:46:40,701 --> 02:46:41,270
cubicle.

3717
02:46:41,270 --> 02:46:42,860
Well that's one thing that I assumed we
would have.

3718
02:46:42,861 --> 02:46:44,960
We would have gotten to today,
which I'm surprised we didn't,

3719
02:46:44,961 --> 02:46:47,750
which is like the rise of automation and
robotics and stuff.

3720
02:46:47,751 --> 02:46:48,620
I mean,
millions.

3721
02:46:48,621 --> 02:46:51,740
How many millions of Americans,
I think it's the largest,

3722
02:46:51,741 --> 02:46:56,741
the largest employment sector full
working class males is driving self

3723
02:46:57,501 --> 02:46:59,060
driving cars.
It just around the bloody corner.

3724
02:46:59,061 --> 02:47:01,970
What's going to happen to the millions
of Americans who make a living driving

3725
02:47:01,971 --> 02:47:04,730
trucks?
The big solution to that that a lot of

3726
02:47:04,731 --> 02:47:07,130
people bring up is universal basic
income,

3727
02:47:07,430 --> 02:47:09,380
but universal basic income,
uh,

3728
02:47:09,620 --> 02:47:11,360
you know there's,
there's people that have a problem with

3729
02:47:11,361 --> 02:47:15,260
that because they believe that people
are only motivated by want and then as

3730
02:47:15,261 --> 02:47:17,720
soon as you give them money,
then they're not going to just pursue

3731
02:47:17,721 --> 02:47:19,100
their interest.
They're going to lay around and do

3732
02:47:19,101 --> 02:47:21,950
nothing and just live off of that money
only.

3733
02:47:22,130 --> 02:47:22,431
Well,
the,

3734
02:47:22,431 --> 02:47:25,760
and this also the question of whether or
not that's right or wrong and comes back

3735
02:47:25,761 --> 02:47:28,610
to America's sort of puritan work work
ethic as well,

3736
02:47:28,611 --> 02:47:30,920
right?
The idea that it would necessarily be

3737
02:47:30,921 --> 02:47:33,530
wrong for a person not to be doing
something productive,

3738
02:47:34,100 --> 02:47:37,280
but like if the robots are doing all the
work and they're producing lots of

3739
02:47:37,281 --> 02:47:39,290
wealth,
then who cares if someone's doing

3740
02:47:39,291 --> 02:47:40,740
something productive or not.
Right?

3741
02:47:40,790 --> 02:47:43,790
We're worried that they're going to get
mad at the people like you that are out

3742
02:47:43,791 --> 02:47:45,260
there being ambitious and they're gonna
kill me.

3743
02:47:45,261 --> 02:47:47,310
Mercedes.
Well maybe I would sometimes not do

3744
02:47:47,311 --> 02:47:49,460
anything as well.
I'm Australian.

3745
02:47:49,461 --> 02:47:52,100
What criminals?
We have a saying that,

3746
02:47:52,370 --> 02:47:55,670
thank God we were convicted by Woo,
thank God we were settled by convicts

3747
02:47:55,671 --> 02:47:58,160
instead of by Puritans to well it's a
good point.

3748
02:47:58,460 --> 02:48:01,070
I mean we've,
we've fighting off the echoes of those

3749
02:48:01,071 --> 02:48:04,400
fucking ridiculous instincts from the
puritans Atlanta to here.

3750
02:48:04,760 --> 02:48:07,820
We're still fighting that off.
I mean that's a big part of what America

3751
02:48:07,821 --> 02:48:08,654
is.
Yeah.

3752
02:48:08,660 --> 02:48:11,360
I think that would be a big impediment
to universal basic income.

3753
02:48:11,420 --> 02:48:14,240
The set,
this puritan sense of justice that there

3754
02:48:14,241 --> 02:48:19,241
is justice and also
I think maybe people just want work.

3755
02:48:20,720 --> 02:48:23,840
They want purpose.
Like the people who were retrenched have

3756
02:48:23,841 --> 02:48:26,660
purpose as well as universal basic
income.

3757
02:48:27,010 --> 02:48:30,410
You would have to sort of program it
into the Zeitgeists of the culture,

3758
02:48:30,530 --> 02:48:34,040
right?
And give people what voluntary ways of

3759
02:48:34,790 --> 02:48:38,570
expressing themselves and contributing
that weren't tied to their income.

3760
02:48:38,840 --> 02:48:41,810
Encourage people to pursue actual
interests.

3761
02:48:41,930 --> 02:48:45,650
Like say if you gave people universal
basic income and encourage them to

3762
02:48:45,651 --> 02:48:48,690
pursue artistic venues or ventures,
you know,

3763
02:48:48,890 --> 02:48:52,220
whether it's a writing or painting or
whenever the fuck it is.

3764
02:48:52,510 --> 02:48:53,151
And you say,
look,

3765
02:48:53,151 --> 02:48:55,280
there's a lot of merit in that.
Like you and you can do this.

3766
02:48:55,280 --> 02:48:56,810
Your food is bought you,
you have,

3767
02:48:56,840 --> 02:48:59,870
you have a home,
you can eat and you can sleep.

3768
02:48:59,900 --> 02:49:02,270
You have a roof over your head now.
Do what you want.

3769
02:49:02,300 --> 02:49:04,010
What do you want to do?
I think it'd be a fence.

3770
02:49:04,050 --> 02:49:06,710
It's a fantastic experiment and I'm glad
that there are a few little

3771
02:49:06,720 --> 02:49:10,140
jurisdictions in Scandinavia and Canada,
which seem to be trying it out because

3772
02:49:10,141 --> 02:49:12,430
I'd be interested to know how many,
like there are,

3773
02:49:12,600 --> 02:49:14,760
you could,
you could imagine different groupings of

3774
02:49:14,761 --> 02:49:18,060
human psychology.
Like some people will be like,

3775
02:49:18,630 --> 02:49:20,700
awesome,
I don't have to worry about making

3776
02:49:20,701 --> 02:49:22,620
money.
I'm going to become the greatest

3777
02:49:22,720 --> 02:49:24,000
artisinal,
you know,

3778
02:49:24,330 --> 02:49:27,180
furniture maker that I can,
and that's fantastic.

3779
02:49:27,390 --> 02:49:28,470
And then at the other end of the
spectrum,

3780
02:49:28,471 --> 02:49:29,910
there'll be people who are like,
sweet,

3781
02:49:29,911 --> 02:49:31,680
don't have to work.
Like I'm just going to sit at home.

3782
02:49:31,710 --> 02:49:32,830
That's fine too day.

3783
02:49:33,180 --> 02:49:36,900
What else be that crime rates lower
because of that.

3784
02:49:36,930 --> 02:49:39,510
Oh,
I'm sure that's what we should be hoping

3785
02:49:39,511 --> 02:49:42,060
for it and the idea,
the real good argument for universal

3786
02:49:42,061 --> 02:49:46,110
basic income is that the money that you
spend giving people certain universal

3787
02:49:46,111 --> 02:49:50,370
basic income you would save money from
people going to jail,

3788
02:49:50,400 --> 02:49:54,180
juvenile detention,
medical issues,

3789
02:49:54,480 --> 02:49:57,180
all sorts of issues that come out of
poverty.

3790
02:49:57,600 --> 02:50:00,450
There's a lot of issues that come out of
poverty that are directly connected to

3791
02:50:00,451 --> 02:50:00,931
that.
Yeah.

3792
02:50:00,931 --> 02:50:02,730
This is one of the arguments for welfare
as well.

3793
02:50:02,731 --> 02:50:06,030
I mean people who say that it wouldn't
have any impact on crime.

3794
02:50:06,330 --> 02:50:09,630
I would just say look at the different
countries in the world that have more or

3795
02:50:09,631 --> 02:50:13,860
less generous welfare systems and the
ones with more generous welfare systems

3796
02:50:13,980 --> 02:50:18,210
do tend to be more peaceful places.
There might be other reasons as well.

3797
02:50:18,850 --> 02:50:22,890
I think they're correlated and I think
also one of the things that I try to do,

3798
02:50:22,950 --> 02:50:27,950
I really try to support people who make
things and make things by hand.

3799
02:50:28,380 --> 02:50:32,610
People companies that like make stuff.
I like when people make stuff.

3800
02:50:32,611 --> 02:50:35,520
I like when when people pursue like,
like this,

3801
02:50:36,090 --> 02:50:37,740
this tables,
I mean by an artist,

3802
02:50:37,770 --> 02:50:41,220
you know,
I like when people make handmade knives.

3803
02:50:41,221 --> 02:50:43,370
I'd like that stuff.
I think the more API,

3804
02:50:43,440 --> 02:50:46,710
I think people get deep satisfaction in
doing things like that.

3805
02:50:46,950 --> 02:50:49,300
You know,
like I'm Russell Bill,

3806
02:50:49,301 --> 02:50:52,230
the guy made that clock right there.
That's a handmaid clock.

3807
02:50:52,231 --> 02:50:54,670
That dude built that fucking thing.
That one.

3808
02:50:55,290 --> 02:50:57,330
This tgg studios.
It built that right there.

3809
02:50:57,331 --> 02:51:01,050
That's a handmade clock too.
I tried to support that shit as much as

3810
02:51:01,051 --> 02:51:03,930
possible.
I think that that is the future.

3811
02:51:04,300 --> 02:51:05,390
The there's,
there's,

3812
02:51:05,490 --> 02:51:07,860
when I look at that clock,
I know a guy made that.

3813
02:51:07,890 --> 02:51:09,240
Yeah,
that means something to me.

3814
02:51:09,241 --> 02:51:10,180
Yeah.
It's cool.

3815
02:51:10,181 --> 02:51:12,350
It's cool.
It is also a really cool looking at,

3816
02:51:12,720 --> 02:51:16,240
if you asked me to make a clock,
wouldn't know where to start.

3817
02:51:16,560 --> 02:51:18,210
Well,
you would figure it out.

3818
02:51:18,510 --> 02:51:21,450
I would if you gave them the books and
all that stuff,

3819
02:51:21,451 --> 02:51:23,820
but you might,
it might not be a clock for you and

3820
02:51:23,821 --> 02:51:24,510
Maggie.
Yeah,

3821
02:51:24,510 --> 02:51:25,920
that,
that Buddhist sculpture.

3822
02:51:25,921 --> 02:51:27,690
Somebody made that and send it to me.
It's great.

3823
02:51:27,691 --> 02:51:30,660
I mean there's a lot of things that
people can make that other people would

3824
02:51:30,661 --> 02:51:34,080
enjoy.
And I think our teasel goods and

3825
02:51:34,081 --> 02:51:38,430
services and things that people do that
are hand crafted,

3826
02:51:38,431 --> 02:51:42,330
they have a special meaning to them that
people they value.

3827
02:51:42,570 --> 02:51:44,370
I wonder if there's something that's
mass produced.

3828
02:51:44,371 --> 02:51:48,390
I wonder if enough people can find self
expression through that to counteract

3829
02:51:48,420 --> 02:51:52,170
the uh,
the job losses that are resulting from

3830
02:51:52,180 --> 02:51:55,350
and will continue to result from
technological advance.

3831
02:51:55,470 --> 02:51:58,140
Well,
I think that with universal basic income

3832
02:51:58,200 --> 02:52:01,110
is possible,
but I think making things is not

3833
02:52:01,111 --> 02:52:03,040
necessarily the only way to do it.
I mean it's,

3834
02:52:03,320 --> 02:52:05,500
it has making art,
being creative,

3835
02:52:05,530 --> 02:52:06,190
encouraging

3836
02:52:06,190 --> 02:52:08,500
people to think of that as an actual way
to live.

3837
02:52:08,520 --> 02:52:10,120
Yeah,
that's a big,

3838
02:52:10,540 --> 02:52:14,040
that's a big impediment and a big hurdle
to get over it.

3839
02:52:14,041 --> 02:52:15,610
It's like the North Korea thing that you
were saying,

3840
02:52:15,611 --> 02:52:17,590
like if you got rid of the North Korean
regime,

3841
02:52:17,591 --> 02:52:20,050
would the people who lived under it have
the scope,

3842
02:52:20,110 --> 02:52:23,530
have the just a mental scope to know
what to do with themselves?

3843
02:52:23,531 --> 02:52:26,620
In some ways it's a comparable question
with capitalism,

3844
02:52:26,621 --> 02:52:28,030
right?
If you took away the capitalist

3845
02:52:28,031 --> 02:52:31,180
incentive to work and suddenly all of a
sudden everybody was liberated and had a

3846
02:52:31,181 --> 02:52:34,690
basic income that that gave them all the
sustenance that they need.

3847
02:52:35,230 --> 02:52:37,660
Would they have the horizons available
to them?

3848
02:52:37,661 --> 02:52:40,870
Having been raised in this idea of like,
you gotta get gotta work,

3849
02:52:40,871 --> 02:52:43,300
I gotta climb your way up the ladder.
I got to get a nine to five job,

3850
02:52:43,301 --> 02:52:44,710
go to college,
get an education,

3851
02:52:44,980 --> 02:52:45,850
you know,
please the boss,

3852
02:52:45,851 --> 02:52:50,020
get your promotion to have all of that
suddenly fall away and be like,

3853
02:52:50,021 --> 02:52:50,530
you know what?

3854
02:52:50,530 --> 02:52:52,590
Just go and make clocks.
But Cy,

3855
02:52:52,610 --> 02:52:54,460
you anyway,
boob would figure it out,

3856
02:52:54,820 --> 02:52:56,620
but other people would be like,
lottery winners.

3857
02:52:56,621 --> 02:52:58,060
They just go crazy.
Yeah.

3858
02:52:58,120 --> 02:53:00,670
Like lottery winners almost universally
lose all their money.

3859
02:53:00,700 --> 02:53:03,520
I know.
And they end up on the happier they,

3860
02:53:04,370 --> 02:53:05,500
yeah.
If you just,

3861
02:53:05,530 --> 02:53:08,560
if you win $5 million in the lottery,
everybody goes,

3862
02:53:08,561 --> 02:53:09,490
Josh,
come on.

3863
02:53:09,700 --> 02:53:11,610
It's free for you.
I can't hillsborough.

3864
02:53:11,650 --> 02:53:12,241
Yeah,
exactly.

3865
02:53:12,241 --> 02:53:12,921
Yup,
that's right.

3866
02:53:12,921 --> 02:53:13,930
And then people start,
look,

3867
02:53:13,960 --> 02:53:16,440
you and I are going to do a business.
We're going to paint cars.

3868
02:53:16,480 --> 02:53:16,931
You're like,
fuck,

3869
02:53:16,931 --> 02:53:19,560
I don't want pink cars.
And next thing you know your loan and

3870
02:53:19,561 --> 02:53:22,690
money out and family wants money from
you and you're just dealing with a lot

3871
02:53:22,691 --> 02:53:24,940
of bullshit.
And also you have expectations

3872
02:53:24,941 --> 02:53:27,190
immediately after winning that things
are going to get a lot better.

3873
02:53:27,700 --> 02:53:32,380
As you know from anyone who has paid
attention to there the process of their

3874
02:53:32,381 --> 02:53:34,570
own consciousness,
whether that's through psychedelics or

3875
02:53:34,571 --> 02:53:37,360
flotation tanks or you know what Sam
Harris and Dan Harris,

3876
02:53:37,361 --> 02:53:39,550
we're talking about recently about
meditation.

3877
02:53:39,880 --> 02:53:43,300
Your,
your conscious perception of life is not

3878
02:53:43,870 --> 02:53:48,870
determined by what's going on outside.
It is trivially occasionally and like

3879
02:53:49,001 --> 02:53:51,940
into like for in the short term,
but in the long term,

3880
02:53:51,941 --> 02:53:54,880
your actual happiness,
it comes from within.

3881
02:53:55,090 --> 02:53:58,060
But people always take the path of least
resistance.

3882
02:53:58,061 --> 02:54:01,090
And oftentimes the path of least
resistance is these patterns that we've

3883
02:54:01,091 --> 02:54:04,420
carved into our behavior,
these behavior patterns that we've

3884
02:54:04,421 --> 02:54:08,650
carved into our psyche.
And a lot of times those aren't even the

3885
02:54:08,651 --> 02:54:11,350
path of least resistance.
They become the path of more resistance,

3886
02:54:11,560 --> 02:54:15,580
but we're so accustomed to those paths
that we think of them and treat them as

3887
02:54:15,581 --> 02:54:17,390
if they're the right path.
Hmm.

3888
02:54:18,700 --> 02:54:21,220
Mind blown.
Fucking man.

3889
02:54:21,850 --> 02:54:24,130
There's no answers.
There's no answers to a portion.

3890
02:54:24,131 --> 02:54:26,860
There's no answers in North Korea.
We didn't figure out shit.

3891
02:54:27,310 --> 02:54:30,430
It's not the point.
Joe Pine to figure it out.

3892
02:54:32,650 --> 02:54:34,360
Let's end this and do yours.
Yeah.

3893
02:54:34,361 --> 02:54:36,010
Wonderful.
I'll talk to you.

3894
02:54:36,030 --> 02:54:39,190
I'm going to do like a quick,
quick round of questions and also

3895
02:54:39,200 --> 02:54:41,980
chickasha terrestrials on my podcast
with Joe.

3896
02:54:42,070 --> 02:54:44,290
Josh motherfucking steps.
Ladies and gentlemen.

3897
02:54:44,320 --> 02:54:45,153
Thank you,
sir.

3898
02:54:46,260 --> 02:54:47,350
I love you.
I love you too,

3899
02:54:47,351 --> 02:54:48,460
brother.
All right.

3900
02:54:48,610 --> 02:54:50,020
We'll be right back with Josh as apps.
