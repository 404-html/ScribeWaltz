1
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,240
Two,
one,

2
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:11,850
boom.
Welcome back.

3
00:00:11,851 --> 00:00:13,410
Ms Dot Peterson.
Thank you.

4
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:15,240
How are you?
Not too bad.

5
00:00:15,241 --> 00:00:16,950
How are you doing?
Doing good man.

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,220
You look like a,
um,

7
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:25,310
a man who was dealing with a 
considerable amount of stress but is 

8
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:25,310
handling it well.
Yeah.

9
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:25,620
Well,
I hope that's true.

10
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,770
I think the first part of it's true.
I hope the second part is true.

11
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:33,860
I read that you were denied a grant for 
the first time in your history as an 

12
00:00:36,301 --> 00:00:37,890
academic.
Yes.

13
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:43,040
And you think this is all based on your 
outspoken and very public,

14
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,120
um,
denouncing the political correctness and

15
00:00:48,121 --> 00:00:53,121
have all this stuff that you've been 
going through over the past more than a 

16
00:00:53,121 --> 00:00:56,931
year now?
I don't know because I haven't got the 

17
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:59,631
full commentary on the grant yet.
I only found out that it was denied and 

18
00:00:59,631 --> 00:01:00,840
it takes the granting agency a while to 
send out the full report.

19
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,320
I've heard from other people,
I know some other people who I would 

20
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:06,780
consider relatively high profile 
researchers.

21
00:01:06,781 --> 00:01:08,910
Uh,
walls also didn't get funded this round.

22
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,420
So there might be multiple reasons,
but I can't help suspect that the fact 

23
00:01:14,911 --> 00:01:19,911
that the grant application concentrated 
on delineating the personality 

24
00:01:19,911 --> 00:01:22,350
characteristics of politically correct 
belief might've had something to do with

25
00:01:22,351 --> 00:01:25,380
it.
So still a taboo subject.

26
00:01:25,381 --> 00:01:30,381
It's fascinating that thinking and 
thinking and pondering and examining 

27
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:34,080
certain types of behavior would still be
a taboo subject.

28
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,400
Yeah.
Is Amazing.

29
00:01:35,401 --> 00:01:37,530
Alright.
And becoming more taboo all the time.

30
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:41,370
I would say.
I don't think the universities are have.

31
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:47,150
I think they're getting worse still and 
it will be awhile before they get 

32
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:47,150
better.
I shouldn't say that.

33
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:51,321
So globally,
but certainly the case with the 

34
00:01:51,321 --> 00:01:51,321
humanities and much of the social 
sciences,

35
00:01:51,321 --> 00:01:55,570
but it seems globally,
I mean not necessarily in terms of all 

36
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:59,271
the different subjects but certainly in 
terms of what you teach and what your 

37
00:01:59,271 --> 00:02:02,290
involved in and it just.
It's so

38
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,730
me,
I hate to use the word,

39
00:02:04,731 --> 00:02:09,731
but it's so regressive to put 
restrictions on the examining of 

40
00:02:10,581 --> 00:02:14,000
thinking in a university.
I mean it's kind of crazy.

41
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:19,150
I mean what,
what you went through in one of your 

42
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:23,680
most recent public speeches where they 
allowed these kids to be in the room 

43
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:28,670
with you with bullhorns and they were 
screaming event Jamie,

44
00:02:28,671 --> 00:02:30,500
see if he could find the video that.
What was the name?

45
00:02:30,501 --> 00:02:32,570
Master master.
Master University.

46
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:37,620
Yeah,
and you were giving your speech and 

47
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:37,620
there was supposed to be some other 
people involved.

48
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,310
They backed out and you decided to 
continue on,

49
00:02:40,311 --> 00:02:43,340
so you're standing there in front of 
these people that were there to hear you

50
00:02:43,341 --> 00:02:48,341
talk and there's a group of kids with 
bull horns like literally and shouting 

51
00:02:48,921 --> 00:02:51,950
and yelling and chanting with signs in 
the room,

52
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,740
just completely disrupting what you're 
doing.

53
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:57,680
And they allowed this all to happen.
Airhorns as well.

54
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:58,800
So.
Yeah.

55
00:02:58,801 --> 00:03:00,040
And they blowing air horns quite

56
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,610
close.
To me.

57
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,940
That was the one thing I really objected
to because airhorns actually happened to

58
00:03:03,941 --> 00:03:04,720
be quite loud.

59
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,650
No,
no,

60
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:08,280
that's.
It's actually an assault on your ears.

61
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:11,580
It's very bad for your hearing.
Like you're not supposed to be in a room

62
00:03:11,581 --> 00:03:16,581
with those without hearing protection.
They're supposed to be like for like 

63
00:03:16,581 --> 00:03:17,910
scary things like play some of this 
Jamie so we can hear how crazy.

64
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:18,860
Yes.

65
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,350
Yelling,
shut him down.

66
00:03:31,351 --> 00:03:36,351
No freedom for hate speech and the hate 
speech thing has like prince symbol meet

67
00:03:40,161 --> 00:03:45,161
some sort of Martian language.
Like what the fuck is that that they 

68
00:03:45,161 --> 00:03:46,530
have on that note?
No freedom for hate speech.

69
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:50,510
I guess it's a poly gender,
a symbol of some sort.

70
00:03:50,511 --> 00:03:54,230
There's a fist in it.
One of the things that was really not so

71
00:03:54,231 --> 00:03:59,231
good about all of that was that a lot of
the people who were protesting were 

72
00:03:59,231 --> 00:04:01,220
standing behind a hammer and sickle 
banner,

73
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:06,950
you know,
which just absolutely amazes me because 

74
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:06,950
I still haven't been able to quite 
figure this out.

75
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:10,310
I can't figure out why you couldn't do 
that with a Nazi symbol,

76
00:04:10,311 --> 00:04:12,470
but you can do that with a hammer and 
sickle,

77
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,540
you know it's.
There's a reason.

78
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:18,620
Maybe it's because the Nazi doctrine was
so explicitly racist,

79
00:04:18,621 --> 00:04:23,621
but God,
it's not like the hammer and sickle 

80
00:04:23,621 --> 00:04:26,291
wasn't equally murderous or be actually 
quite profoundly more murderous as it 

81
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:27,780
turned out.
So and I how,

82
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,510
how people can not steal,
no,

83
00:04:29,511 --> 00:04:32,000
that is beyond me.
And,

84
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:37,060
and to rally behind a banner like that 
without realizing what they're doing or 

85
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:41,800
even worse,
realizing it and still organizing 

86
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,220
themselves behind it,
explained about hate speech.

87
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,650
No,
there's no real communicating with,

88
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:48,740
with people who are demonstrating that 
they're in a kind of trance,

89
00:04:48,741 --> 00:04:53,741
you know,
and I went up to try to talk to you a 

90
00:04:53,741 --> 00:04:56,231
couple of them and,
but when you look at people who are in 

91
00:04:56,241 --> 00:05:01,241
that state of mind,
they're not looking at you as if you're 

92
00:05:01,241 --> 00:05:01,241
a human being,
you know,

93
00:05:01,241 --> 00:05:05,441
you're the,
you're the target of their 

94
00:05:05,441 --> 00:05:07,240
conceptualizations.
You're the realization of their 

95
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,211
conceptualizations.
Of course they didn't listen to 

96
00:05:10,211 --> 00:05:10,211
anything.
I said,

97
00:05:10,211 --> 00:05:10,880
well hardly anyone did.
Although I got to talk outside because I

98
00:05:10,881 --> 00:05:14,090
took everybody outside and then spoke 
out there for awhile.

99
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:17,120
And when you were outside with his still
yelling and bull horns.

100
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:23,020
But what happened?
I went outside and I stood on a couple 

101
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:26,260
of benches so.
And the people that wanted to hear kind 

102
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,580
of made a circle around me and that more
or less by chance pushed all the 

103
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:34,271
protesters to the back so they could so 
that I could address the people that 

104
00:05:34,271 --> 00:05:36,890
actually wanted me to actually want it 
to listen to what I was saying.

105
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:42,040
And so did you have a dialogue with them
or did you give a speech and how did 

106
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,040
that work?

107
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,070
I didn't have a dialogue at all with the
protesters.

108
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,700
I mean with the people that came to see.
Yeah.

109
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,740
Yeah,
that worked out okay.

110
00:05:46,741 --> 00:05:51,741
Once I got outside and I.
I mean I wasn't particularly upset with 

111
00:05:51,741 --> 00:05:54,000
the fact that the protesters had showed 
up.

112
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:58,040
I mean practically speaking because I'm

113
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,400
in this peculiar situation where if the 
protest is show up,

114
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,930
that's good.
And if they don't show up,

115
00:06:02,931 --> 00:06:06,500
that's good too.
It's good if they show up because I have

116
00:06:06,501 --> 00:06:09,020
access to,
to a youtube audience obviously.

117
00:06:09,021 --> 00:06:12,700
And then it gets filmed and the films 
get put together and that get puts,

118
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,930
that gets put online.
And generally speaking,

119
00:06:14,931 --> 00:06:17,180
when the social justice types have come 
after me,

120
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:22,450
they've done a pretty admirable job of 
discrediting themselves and so that 

121
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:26,681
seems to be all to the good.
And then if they let me speak well then 

122
00:06:26,681 --> 00:06:26,681
I get to speak and I can put that on 
youtube.

123
00:06:26,681 --> 00:06:31,481
So it's,
it's a very strange situation for me 

124
00:06:31,481 --> 00:06:32,900
because as long as I don't do anything 
too stupid or anything,

125
00:06:32,901 --> 00:06:36,710
any stupider than I have done,
let's say I seem to come out okay.

126
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:41,950
And like I'm not,
I'm certainly not counting on that 

127
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,290
continuing and I'm not a,
I'm,

128
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:47,390
I'm surprised by it.
But so far it seems to be working out.

129
00:06:47,391 --> 00:06:50,410
So you know Perrey.
Yes.

130
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:55,570
The way you handled it is admirable.
The way you kept your cool and just 

131
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:57,830
continued talking and didn't flip out 
and didn't,

132
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:01,580
didn't give in,
didn't succumb to the provocation.

133
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,880
It's because they were obviously 
provoking you and they are obviously.

134
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:08,270
I just don't understand how the 
university allows them to do that.

135
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,280
How they allow them to be in that room,
first of all,

136
00:07:10,281 --> 00:07:13,190
with those air horns,
which are really bad for anybody in that

137
00:07:13,191 --> 00:07:14,510
room.
Who's near them?

138
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,580
It causes hearing damage.

139
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,040
Yeah.
Well,

140
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:21,220
in the one person who is,
who is Air Horn me was really quite a,

141
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:24,690
I would say,
let's say forward about it,

142
00:07:24,691 --> 00:07:27,210
you know,
they were coming close enough to me to,

143
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,600
to do some damage and,
and,

144
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:31,570
and,
but,

145
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,270
you know,
I,

146
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:37,700
I have seen the odd person at those 
rallies that really isn't well put 

147
00:07:37,921 --> 00:07:38,910
together,
you know,

148
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:41,360
people I look in their eyes and I think 
no,

149
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:41,960
uh,
you're,

150
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:47,490
you're definitely here for the wrong 
reasons and I think it's more 

151
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:49,110
characteristic often to the guys that I 
see at the events rather than the women.

152
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,340
I mean,
I'm not sure about that.

153
00:07:50,341 --> 00:07:52,560
I'm obviously speculating,
but you know,

154
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:57,590
I have a reasonably good clinical 
intuition and some of the guys I see at 

155
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:58,740
those events there,
I don't know what their story is,

156
00:07:58,741 --> 00:08:00,090
man.
I don't know what they're up to.

157
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:02,280
I guess they're,
what are they trying to do?

158
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:05,880
Be Allies of the women for their own 
nefarious purposes.

159
00:08:05,881 --> 00:08:07,380
I mean,
that's what it looks like to me,

160
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,080
you know?
Well,

161
00:08:08,081 --> 00:08:10,170
there's certainly an issue with that.
It's a,

162
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:15,230
it's a common thread with men,
especially in the male feminists 

163
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:19,191
category that they,
they align themselves with these women 

164
00:08:19,191 --> 00:08:20,320
as allies and as this,
you know,

165
00:08:20,321 --> 00:08:25,321
they take this moral high ground and 
there this person that's going to show 

166
00:08:25,321 --> 00:08:29,010
you know,
other men how to do feminism and how to 

167
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:31,060
behave with women and they're really 
just sort of,

168
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:35,830
they're mining the situations for social
points,

169
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,730
for social sexual points.
My sexual.

170
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,330
Absolutely.
Absolutely.

171
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,530
There's something seriously creepy about
it.

172
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:46,570
I mean,
I saw too that that guy at the Berkeley,

173
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:51,770
the reason Berkeley demonstration,
the guy who hit someone with a bike lock

174
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:56,220
bag and he was hiding behind women and 
then he darted

175
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:01,220
out and just nailed the guy with a bike 
law with what turned out to be a bike 

176
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:01,820
law guy.
It was just hanging there talk to you.

177
00:09:01,821 --> 00:09:03,990
It wasn't being violent.
He wasn't doing anything.

178
00:09:03,991 --> 00:09:05,880
And by the way,
that guy turned out to be a professor.

179
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,140
They found that guy.
Yeah.

180
00:09:07,141 --> 00:09:09,000
And so has that been verified?
All of that.

181
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,660
There's photographs of him.
There's photographs of his face.

182
00:09:12,661 --> 00:09:15,130
They compared the,
his eyes to the professors.

183
00:09:15,131 --> 00:09:20,131
Are they know that the guy was there and
then the guy will aligns himself with 

184
00:09:20,131 --> 00:09:24,081
Marxism and he's just like a communist 
slash socialist professor who's very 

185
00:09:25,351 --> 00:09:30,351
adamantly against a right wing ideology 
and this kind of Shit.

186
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:34,590
So He,
I'm pretty sure that that's the guy.

187
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,160
Yeah.
Yeah.

188
00:09:35,161 --> 00:09:37,260
Well I kind of followed that and I 
noticed that.

189
00:09:37,261 --> 00:09:39,240
I mean for,
as far as I'm concerned,

190
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:42,390
watching what he did,
that's the true face of those people.

191
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:47,450
It's assault.
I mean he hit a guy with a deadly 

192
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:47,450
weapon.
Yeah.

193
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,080
I mean I also thought it was blackly 
comic that it was a bike lock.

194
00:09:49,081 --> 00:09:51,370
I mean that just figures,
you know so.

195
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:57,440
Well,
it's just the idea that you could just 

196
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,120
walk up to someone you don't like the 
way they think and hit them in the head 

197
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,120
with a metal thing.
It's just so.

198
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,890
It's so crazy and so delusional and so 
indicative of someone who looks at a 

199
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:08,841
person as the other.
You're not looking at it as a human 

200
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:09,600
being or disagrees with you like.
And not only that,

201
00:10:09,601 --> 00:10:12,570
a young human being talk about a lack of
empathy.

202
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,150
I mean,
you're expecting this 20 year old guy or

203
00:10:15,151 --> 00:10:16,980
however old the guy wasn't get hit in 
the head.

204
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:22,160
You're expecting him to have his 
ideology down solid and not be 

205
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,370
influenced by peers or not.

206
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:28,370
Be Curious about what this argument is,
but the guy wasn't even yelling 

207
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:28,370
anything.
He was just standing there.

208
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:33,350
Yeah.
Well that's Kinda what I thought about 

209
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:33,350
this.
The protesters at mcmaster too,

210
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:33,350
you know,
it's partly,

211
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:37,800
I don't get upset.
It's like I look at these kids that are 

212
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:37,800
out there protesting,
you know,

213
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,350
apart from the professional professional
protestor types and I think,

214
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:45,380
well Jesus,
they've been served so badly by the 

215
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:45,380
education system that it's absolutely 
beyond belief.

216
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:50,270
You know,
they're basically being sent out as 

217
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:52,461
avatars have this pathological 
postmodern movement by their professors 

218
00:10:52,461 --> 00:10:54,270
who are themselves too cowardly to show 
up.

219
00:10:54,271 --> 00:10:58,490
Generally speaking certainly aren't,
aren't brave enough to debate me because

220
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:03,530
they do show up.
They're like this guy with a mask on 

221
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:03,530
hitting people in the head who was a 
professor.

222
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:04,380
Yeah.
Well they don't believe in dialogue.

223
00:11:04,381 --> 00:11:05,480
You know,
it's not part of their.

224
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:10,900
It's not part of the postmodern ethos to
have a dialogue with people you don't 

225
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:14,361
agree with,
so you weren't able to talk to anyone 

226
00:11:14,361 --> 00:11:14,370
that opposed you?
Not so far.

227
00:11:14,371 --> 00:11:17,490
Not In any serious sense.
Were you able to talk to anyone that had

228
00:11:17,491 --> 00:11:20,310
the hammer and sickle sign and and ask 
them like,

229
00:11:20,311 --> 00:11:23,790
do you understand what this stands for?
What does this mean to you?

230
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:24,570
Like what?
What?

231
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,100
What are you trying to project by having
the sun?

232
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:28,070
No,
no,

233
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,090
wasn't,
wasn't possible at that venue.

234
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:30,990
I mean,
like I said,

235
00:11:30,991 --> 00:11:34,290
whenever I got close to anybody that was
protesting that it,

236
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,900
there was no one to one human 
interaction,

237
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:41,930
you know?
I mean I can tell when someone's going 

238
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:43,800
to be willing to communicate with me and
when they've kind of got cold eyes,

239
00:11:43,801 --> 00:11:45,220
like a cod fish,
you know,

240
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:50,630
whatever they're looking at has nothing 
to do with me or very little to do with 

241
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:50,630
me.

242
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:54,800
Well,
that seems to me to be one of the 

243
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,940
weirder aspects of this thing that 
you're going through this,

244
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,910
this,
these,

245
00:11:57,911 --> 00:12:02,911
all these series of altercations that 
you're going through is the lack of 

246
00:12:02,911 --> 00:12:07,231
discourse.
And there was this one that you went on 

247
00:12:07,231 --> 00:12:07,990
to on television when we talked about 
the last time you were here with.

248
00:12:07,991 --> 00:12:12,991
It's very bizarre and drudging this 
person that was saying there's no 

249
00:12:12,991 --> 00:12:15,070
gender,
there is no biological basis for gender,

250
00:12:15,071 --> 00:12:20,071
which is just complete insanity and you 
shooting that down and might be 

251
00:12:20,071 --> 00:12:24,511
insanity,
but it's Canadian law now or soon to be 

252
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:25,480
federally.
So it's insanity for sure.

253
00:12:25,481 --> 00:12:30,481
But.
But it's the kind of insanity that's 

254
00:12:30,481 --> 00:12:32,671
going to have legal force very soon.
What is it specifically that there's no 

255
00:12:33,191 --> 00:12:33,880
seat?
Well,

256
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:39,030
with Bill [inaudible],
which was the bill that I was 

257
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:41,251
complaining about or criticizing,
let's say there's a variety of 

258
00:12:41,251 --> 00:12:46,201
surrounding policy documents that are 
derived from the Ontario Human Rights 

259
00:12:46,201 --> 00:12:48,310
Commission and they,
they indicate quite clearly that year to

260
00:12:48,311 --> 00:12:51,490
regard biological sex,
gender identity,

261
00:12:51,491 --> 00:12:55,570
gender expression and sexual proclivity 
as varying independently.

262
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:59,200
Which of course they don't by any 
stretch of the imagination.

263
00:12:59,201 --> 00:13:04,201
They're so tightly correlated that well,
you can't use correlation to imply cause

264
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:06,820
or to infer causality.
But Jesus,

265
00:13:06,821 --> 00:13:09,550
when the correlations are above point 
nine five,

266
00:13:09,551 --> 00:13:14,551
you have to start wondering if there's 
actually not some causal link and it's 

267
00:13:14,551 --> 00:13:16,300
absurd to me that we really even have to
have that discussion.

268
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:21,870
But the notion,
and this is being taught to schoolkids 

269
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:21,870
this,
this isn't,

270
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:24,370
this is mainstream doctrine.
Joe The gender.

271
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:27,250
Look up the gender Unicorn.
That's a fun thing to look up.

272
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:32,350
What is the Gender Unicorn?
The Gender Unicorn is this little happy 

273
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:33,700
symbol that's being marketed to 
children,

274
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:36,010
you know,
in elementary school,

275
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:41,310
uh,
describing to them the fact that 

276
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:41,310
biological sex,
gender identity,

277
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:43,810
gender expression and sexual proclivity 
very independently,

278
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:47,230
they're going after them very young.
And so that's part of the,

279
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,420
that's part of the school system now in 
many,

280
00:13:49,421 --> 00:13:50,140
many places.

281
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:52,390
So in many ways it's sort of an 
indoctrination.

282
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:55,570
They're trying to say that the gender 
Unicorn,

283
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:57,700
a Unicorn man,
check that thing out.

284
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,830
Gender identity,
female woman,

285
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,120
girl,
male man,

286
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,080
boy,
other gender,

287
00:14:02,081 --> 00:14:03,760
gender expression,
feminine,

288
00:14:03,761 --> 00:14:06,220
Masculine.
Other sex assigned at birth,

289
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,420
female,
Male,

290
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:09,960
other intersex.
Ooh,

291
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:13,240
like aliens,
physically attracted to men,

292
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,650
women,
other,

293
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:20,250
other gender s emotionally attracted.
So what you do if you're a kid is you 

294
00:14:20,621 --> 00:14:25,621
put a little marker there on the Arrow 
to show where you're located on all 

295
00:14:25,621 --> 00:14:28,000
those independent dimensions.
And obviously if you look at the,

296
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:32,560
at the style of the Gender Unicorn,
you can tell what sort of age it's aimed

297
00:14:32,561 --> 00:14:34,150
at [inaudible] that looks like it's 
aimed for.

298
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:37,570
Certainly not aimed at kids over,
I would say 10.

299
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:42,750
Yeah.
Why does the Gender Unicorn have a 

300
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:42,970
double helix DNA symbol where it's penis
or vagina.

301
00:14:42,971 --> 00:14:45,530
So should they.
That's to indicate that there's no law.

302
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:48,220
There's no such thing as biology,
I presume,

303
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:53,760
but why?
That's how ironic might say so yeah,

304
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:57,620
it's a weird place to put it over the 
crotch of the UNICORNS.

305
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:03,170
There's,
there's an indefinite number of weird 

306
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:03,170
things about that.
But yes,

307
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:05,530
there's the ginger ginger,
gender bread person that's A.

308
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:09,500
Oh,
genderbread person has a male symbol,

309
00:15:09,501 --> 00:15:11,320
female symbol.
And then uh,

310
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:15,810
what am I all together with a circle 
where the,

311
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:18,680
a whole not a whole circle.
So strange,

312
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:22,430
problematic place for the circle.
I would say very assumptive.

313
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,690
I would say so,
yes.

314
00:15:23,691 --> 00:15:25,430
Yes.
I don't like that at all.

315
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:27,020
I feel triggered.
Well,

316
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:32,320
the whole thing is it's so bizarre,
but what's even more bizarre is the lack

317
00:15:33,081 --> 00:15:38,081
of dialogue.
I feel like you're in a weird position 

318
00:15:38,081 --> 00:15:42,070
where there's a tremendous amount of 
support for you outside of the academic 

319
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:44,630
system.
People like me,

320
00:15:44,631 --> 00:15:47,480
people like so many people that support 
your youtube videos,

321
00:15:47,481 --> 00:15:52,481
so many people that read about you 
online and you're experiencing all this 

322
00:15:52,481 --> 00:15:55,280
backlash at like mcmasters and these 
sort of things,

323
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:58,660
but there's people are not engaging you 
and the way they are,

324
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:00,050
they're keeping from engaging.

325
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:03,620
You is saying that you are demonstrating
hate speech,

326
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,530
hate speech.
There's racism.

327
00:16:06,531 --> 00:16:09,740
The reason I'd be called a racist is 
because I complained.

328
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:14,980
I criticized the University of Toronto's
decision to use the Toronto chapter of 

329
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:19,781
black lives matter as policy advisers 
and the reason I did that was because 

330
00:16:19,781 --> 00:16:22,040
the two women who founded black lives 
matter in Toronto,

331
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:28,560
let's say they have,
let's say they have questionable 

332
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,961
reputations and leave it at that and so 
apparently that makes me racist because.

333
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:37,690
Well,
you don't question them because they're 

334
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:37,690
not.
Well.

335
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:41,070
He.
One of them has publicly stated that 

336
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:46,240
white people are inferior to black 
people because they don't have enough 

337
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,481
melanin in their skin and Melanin is the
chemical that communicates cosmically so

338
00:16:49,581 --> 00:16:54,581
that you're spiritually enlightened.
That was one essential claim and the 

339
00:16:54,581 --> 00:16:59,171
other one is is embroiled in lawsuit 
with the University of Toronto Students 

340
00:16:59,171 --> 00:17:01,310
Union for essentially she's been accused
of embezzling,

341
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:04,520
embezzling with a couple of cronies,
about $400,000

342
00:17:04,521 --> 00:17:09,320
from the coffers of the student's Union,
so I felt that perhaps those weren't the

343
00:17:09,321 --> 00:17:14,321
best people to for the University of 
Toronto to be associating with when 

344
00:17:14,321 --> 00:17:15,110
they're formulating their anti racist 
policies.

345
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:17,120
Well clearly that makes you racist 
clearly,

346
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,170
clearly.
Well,

347
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:22,890
it's unfair as well altogether in one 
little lump sump.

348
00:17:22,891 --> 00:17:26,330
That's man thing.
But what's really fascinating about that

349
00:17:26,331 --> 00:17:28,160
is like you're not saying anything about
black people,

350
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:30,980
you're saying about two individuals to 
individuals that you and you're,

351
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,900
you're having very specific.
You know,

352
00:17:32,901 --> 00:17:35,150
everybody that makes up a group is the 
same.

353
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:41,050
You see,
you have to understand that men and 

354
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:41,050
women,
right?

355
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:41,350
That's right.
Except men and women,

356
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:43,340
men and women can be anything.
Well,

357
00:17:43,341 --> 00:17:48,341
there's an interesting angle on the 
transsexual thing to a because these 

358
00:17:48,341 --> 00:17:52,211
activists,
they stand out and claim they're 

359
00:17:52,211 --> 00:17:52,211
standing

360
00:17:52,211 --> 00:17:52,500
for oppressed communities right in,
first of all,

361
00:17:52,501 --> 00:17:57,180
they identify the identity group that 
they're activated activating on,

362
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:02,210
on the part of as a community and then 
they imply that it's a generous 

363
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:06,980
community and then they state that 
because they happen to be members of 

364
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,460
that community by their own admission,
let's say,

365
00:18:08,461 --> 00:18:13,461
or by their own declaration.
That's a better word that they are now 

366
00:18:13,461 --> 00:18:14,550
legitimate representatives of that 
community.

367
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:19,820
And one of the things that's been quite 
fascinating to me since this has 

368
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,641
occurred is that I've had a very,
a comparatively large number of letters 

369
00:18:22,641 --> 00:18:27,381
from transgender people about 35 so far 
and every one of those except one was 

370
00:18:27,381 --> 00:18:32,151
positive.
They are not happy about my sampling of 

371
00:18:32,151 --> 00:18:34,560
the Trans Community,
which isn't,

372
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:41,110
you know,
it's not a random sample or anything 

373
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:41,110
like that,
but 35 letters is a lot.

374
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:44,620
When the community of people is actually
quite small and they're not happy at all

375
00:18:44,621 --> 00:18:45,160
that they don't.

376
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:50,450
They don't.
They're not happy to be so publicly 

377
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:52,020
discussed now because many of them would
just assume have some privacy,

378
00:18:52,021 --> 00:18:57,021
you know,
and they're already having trouble 

379
00:18:57,021 --> 00:18:58,281
fitting in.
They don't regard these people as 

380
00:18:58,281 --> 00:19:00,351
legitimate representatives.
They don't believe they're not 

381
00:19:00,351 --> 00:19:00,960
homogenous in their political 
viewpoints,

382
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:01,900
you know,
and,

383
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:07,050
and they're not necessarily fans of the 
people who are playing gender bender 

384
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:08,820
games because many of the transsexuals 
who are,

385
00:19:08,821 --> 00:19:10,650
let's say serious about it,
you know,

386
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:15,651
for,
for lack of a better way of describing 

387
00:19:15,651 --> 00:19:15,651
it,
aren't happy that this has become a kind

388
00:19:15,651 --> 00:19:20,211
of a fad essentially,
and that they're being used by the 

389
00:19:20,211 --> 00:19:20,820
politically correct types to further 
their political agenda.

390
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:26,090
So that's quite cool to because it isn't
obvious to me at all that the attitude 

391
00:19:27,361 --> 00:19:32,310
that I have towards the situation is 
actually different in any genuine sense.

392
00:19:32,311 --> 00:19:37,311
Then the attitude that at least a 
substantial minority of the transsexual 

393
00:19:37,311 --> 00:19:41,301
people themselves have,
and there's plenty of them on youtube 

394
00:19:41,301 --> 00:19:44,010
who are complaining about the social 
justice appropriation of their,

395
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,260
of their identity.

396
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:51,500
Well,
I don't even know if they have a 

397
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:51,500
movement.
They're not a community,

398
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:51,500
right?
I mean that they're not a community.

399
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:55,350
I mean a community is in continual 
contact with one another.

400
00:19:55,351 --> 00:19:59,040
They have something that directs their 
actions in common.

401
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,540
I mean,
but you know,

402
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,560
on the,
on the,

403
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:07,100
on the postmodern end of the spectrum,
if you have some identifiable group 

404
00:20:07,261 --> 00:20:09,990
feature,
then that means you're one of that group

405
00:20:09,991 --> 00:20:14,991
and that everything that you do 
indicates indicates only that means 

406
00:20:14,991 --> 00:20:19,350
there are believers in,
in race and gender and sex.

407
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:24,530
They believe in the reality of those of 
those categories far more than anybody 

408
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:27,620
on the right as far as I can tell.
So it's very peculiar and,

409
00:20:27,621 --> 00:20:29,280
and unnerving,
so,

410
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:35,300
so and,
and widespread and powerful and all of 

411
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,901
those things.
So it's very peculiar that they are not 

412
00:20:38,901 --> 00:20:40,140
into labels unless it suits their 
purposes.

413
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:45,590
They're not in the labels or into a 
generalizing behavior unless it suits 

414
00:20:45,901 --> 00:20:48,310
their purpose.
And also another thing that's weird

415
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:52,720
to me is that whenever something becomes
an issue that becomes discussed,

416
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:56,680
that becomes a hot button issue,
which clearly transgender rights,

417
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:02,040
whether it's the North Carolina bill,
to keep transgender people out of the 

418
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,080
bathrooms that associate with that 
identify with that they identify with,

419
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:10,110
with whatever gender it is,
whenever there's some sort of a hot 

420
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:13,141
button issue,
there becomes this thing where a bunch 

421
00:21:13,141 --> 00:21:17,260
of people seek attention through those 
issues and these people,

422
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:21,530
uh,
use whatever issue it is to be,

423
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:24,100
it becomes like a part of their 
identity,

424
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:26,750
like becoming an activist and,
and,

425
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,960
and really being very vocal about it.
Whereas though the,

426
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:34,980
the actual cause itself gets muddied in 
the cult of personality and it gets 

427
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:39,391
muddied in these personal wishes and 
ideas that the people who are seeking to

428
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:45,550
get attention by communicating about 
these ideas sort of soak in.

429
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:46,230
You know,
it,

430
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:46,720
it,
it,

431
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,200
it just becomes a lot about human nature
and human behavior more than it is about

432
00:21:52,331 --> 00:21:53,040
the actual issue.

433
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:56,590
And so it's an opportunity.
Each of these hypothetically contentious

434
00:21:56,591 --> 00:22:01,390
issues is an opportunity for a certain 
kind of sterile drama to unfold.

435
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,220
And the drama is always the same.
I mean,

436
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:05,050
you can see that in the,
in the,

437
00:22:05,051 --> 00:22:10,051
um,
demonstrations say with regards to my 

438
00:22:10,051 --> 00:22:10,051
talks,
it doesn't matter what I'm talking about

439
00:22:10,051 --> 00:22:11,590
and it actually doesn't matter what I've
ever said,

440
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:17,100
all that matters is that there was an 
occasion and an excuse to trot out the 

441
00:22:17,171 --> 00:22:22,171
ideology and to end to pathetically 
mouth the same unbelievably sterile and 

442
00:22:24,731 --> 00:22:26,440
chaotic phrases.
You know,

443
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:29,350
I mean the,
I think the people at mcmaster,

444
00:22:29,351 --> 00:22:34,351
the protesters could only muster about 
three chance and two of them were 

445
00:22:34,351 --> 00:22:38,311
seriously obscene and I mean,
which I don't care about except that 

446
00:22:38,311 --> 00:22:42,301
it's so mindlessly unimaginative in what
it is they're operating at such a low 

447
00:22:43,301 --> 00:22:45,460
level of,
of intellectual effort.

448
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:50,820
And,
and of course Egged on by their 

449
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,180
pathological postmodern professors who 
are hiding behind them,

450
00:22:52,181 --> 00:22:53,590
like,
like scared,

451
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:55,090
scared weasels.

452
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:58,230
So there's shut him down.
That was the big one,

453
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,650
racist,
transphobic,

454
00:22:59,651 --> 00:23:04,651
homophobic,
all these things without substance 

455
00:23:04,651 --> 00:23:04,750
because there's no piece of shit was the
other one that was quite.

456
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:08,470
That was quite a transphobic piece of 
shit or just more,

457
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:09,880
more,
more specific,

458
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:15,450
more specific,
which was rather flattering and all of 

459
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:15,450
that.
So it's a.

460
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:19,810
You don't seem to have any hate towards 
trans people at all?

461
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:24,870
No,
I mean from the discussions I've had 

462
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,761
with you both on and off the air,
the idea of you being transphobic seems 

463
00:23:26,761 --> 00:23:29,860
so inaccurate because you seem pretty 
accepting about anybody,

464
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:32,830
whether it's a trans person,
a gay person,

465
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:37,870
it's not.
The issue is a lot more concerned about 

466
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:38,680
whether or not people are honest.
I mean that's what I,

467
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:42,010
that's what,
that's my fundamental orientation.

468
00:23:42,011 --> 00:23:47,011
And so my fundamental concern,
I mean I don't expect people to be 100 

469
00:23:47,011 --> 00:23:49,330
percent honest because of course who is,
you know,

470
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:53,150
I mean that's a hell of a required 
standard to hold anyone to.

471
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:58,070
But all of that is smoke and mirrors and
I think the people who are after me know

472
00:23:58,071 --> 00:24:03,071
it,
but let's get through some of that just 

473
00:24:03,071 --> 00:24:03,071
to,
just to sort of establish it for people.

474
00:24:03,071 --> 00:24:07,451
Maybe they don't know what issues do.
Do you have any issue whatsoever with 

475
00:24:07,451 --> 00:24:07,910
someone being transgender?
No,

476
00:24:07,911 --> 00:24:12,911
I don't have any issue with that.
What I have an issue with is that is 

477
00:24:12,911 --> 00:24:16,570
that I don't like to see the postmodern 
Neil Marxists use the trans sexual issue

478
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:21,560
as a lever for pushing forward their 
political nonsense and I said that right

479
00:24:21,561 --> 00:24:23,810
from the beginning and the videos are 
made to begin with.

480
00:24:23,811 --> 00:24:28,811
The reason I wouldn't use the word Z and
[inaudible] and all those other made up 

481
00:24:28,811 --> 00:24:33,101
words,
however many there are now is because 

482
00:24:33,101 --> 00:24:35,240
I'm not willing to cede the linguistic 
territory to postmodern radicals.

483
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,400
I'm not doing that.
And they say,

484
00:24:37,401 --> 00:24:42,401
well,
we're doing it on behalf of the 

485
00:24:42,401 --> 00:24:42,401
oppressed transsexual people.

486
00:24:42,401 --> 00:24:42,401
And I think,
yeah,

487
00:24:42,401 --> 00:24:46,601
well that's what you say,
but there's no reason I should believe 

488
00:24:46,601 --> 00:24:46,601
that.
Don't believe anything you say.

489
00:24:46,601 --> 00:24:48,680
I think you're contemptible,
cowardly,

490
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:53,870
ideologically motivated cult like 
corruptors of the youth.

491
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,260
So why would I use your language?
Well,

492
00:24:56,261 --> 00:25:01,261
let's,
let's unpack that because one of the 

493
00:25:01,261 --> 00:25:02,720
things that I find fascinating is how 
few transgender people want to use those

494
00:25:02,721 --> 00:25:07,721
words that transgender people seem to 
want to identify with whatever gender 

495
00:25:07,721 --> 00:25:07,721
they like.
If,

496
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,910
if you are a male to female transgender 
person,

497
00:25:10,911 --> 00:25:15,911
you would prefer to be called the.
She like Caitlyn Jenner and pretty much 

498
00:25:15,911 --> 00:25:19,160
everybody calls the artist formerly 
known as Bruce Jenner,

499
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,390
Caitlyn Jenner.
Right.

500
00:25:20,391 --> 00:25:21,100
That's.
That's just.

501
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:26,170
It's like if you had a look at how many 
people just openly accept that it's 

502
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:28,160
pretty.
It's pretty well accepted.

503
00:25:28,161 --> 00:25:31,760
Right.
Most transgender people prefer that they

504
00:25:31,761 --> 00:25:35,900
prefer a female to male.
I prefer they prefer to be a man now.

505
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:37,150
I'm a man now.
Okay.

506
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:38,480
Bob,
Dick,

507
00:25:38,481 --> 00:25:41,800
whatever your name is that's in.
There's not a lot of ze Zer.

508
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:43,530
Well,
no,

509
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:48,550
you're not out of the loop.
The other thing is those are all third 

510
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:48,550
person pronouns.
It's like,

511
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:48,740
I don't.
I'm not going to call you a third person

512
00:25:48,741 --> 00:25:50,090
Pronoun while we're sitting here.
You know,

513
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:53,480
I never would.
If I'm referring to you when I'm talking

514
00:25:53,481 --> 00:25:54,710
to someone else,
call her name.

515
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:55,220
Right.
Well,

516
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:56,540
I could use your name,
your name.

517
00:25:56,541 --> 00:25:59,240
I might use he then,
but I don't know.

518
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:02,600
Well,
it's just all of it is palpably absurd.

519
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:08,050
I think it's always hard to get the 
level of analysis for this sort of 

520
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:08,050
issue.
Correct,

521
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:12,670
you know,
because the people who were pushing it 

522
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:12,670
forward say,
well,

523
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:15,460
we're against harassment and and and 
discrimination and and they attributed 

524
00:26:17,381 --> 00:26:22,381
all the moral virtue to themselves,
but then what I see is that they're 

525
00:26:22,381 --> 00:26:25,180
utilizing a group,
a very small minority group who already 

526
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,900
have enough problems,
in my estimation,

527
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:30,800
for for nothing other than 
straightforward political purposes.

528
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:36,160
I don't buy the the warm hearted,
it'll all inclusive.

529
00:26:37,011 --> 00:26:39,830
Love that.
The people who are pushing this of thing

530
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:42,230
for we claim to display.
I don't see that at all.

531
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:43,620
What I see mostly as

532
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:49,070
resentment and the desire to undermine 
and I'm quite familiar with the 

533
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:52,611
postmodern philosophy,
not as familiar as I could be and also 

534
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:55,380
reasonably familiar with its underlying 
Marxism and there's nothing touchy feely

535
00:26:55,381 --> 00:26:57,870
about any of that.
I can tell you the postmodernist,

536
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:01,050
the best you can do with poetry,
postmodernist philosophy is emerged.

537
00:27:01,051 --> 00:27:03,150
Nihilistic.
That's the best.

538
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:06,390
The worst case is that you're kind of an
article,

539
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:11,391
social revolutionary.
That's directionless except that you 

540
00:27:11,391 --> 00:27:13,200
want to tear things apart or,
or that you end up depressed,

541
00:27:13,201 --> 00:27:18,201
which I see happening to students all 
the time because the postmodernist like 

542
00:27:18,201 --> 00:27:20,970
rip out the remaining fee structures of 
their foundations,

543
00:27:20,971 --> 00:27:22,350
of their ethical foundations.

544
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:27,180
So just to be really clear for anybody 
tuning in your issues are absolutely not

545
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:32,210
with someone who identifies with the 
gender other than their biological 

546
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:35,391
gender,
as long as they're not using that to 

547
00:27:35,391 --> 00:27:36,870
promote a political agenda.
And I don't care about the gender thing.

548
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:39,360
That's doesn't mean anything.
Well,

549
00:27:39,361 --> 00:27:40,060
it's someone,
it's,

550
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,520
it's,
it's a personal preference,

551
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:44,490
personal issue personally,
personal issue.

552
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:49,550
And um,
and I would also deal with it on an 

553
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:49,770
individual to individual

554
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:54,770
basis.
It varies just as much as they're 

555
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:54,770
extremely masculine men,
extremely feminine women.

556
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:58,770
And there's a broad spectrum of human 
beings in between and each one should be

557
00:27:58,771 --> 00:28:00,960
dealt with on an individual basis.
Yes,

558
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:05,820
based on what they want.
But when you're talking about these made

559
00:28:05,821 --> 00:28:10,821
up words,
what it seems like as it some people 

560
00:28:10,821 --> 00:28:13,170
trying to push these made up words and 
turn them mainstream.

561
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,870
Now the question is,
what's the motivation behind that?

562
00:28:15,871 --> 00:28:20,871
Is this unnecessary thing?
Are there so many people that are of 

563
00:28:20,871 --> 00:28:25,341
asexual or have some sort of mean?
What would be a z or preserve?

564
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:31,160
What is that supposed to be?
Is that supposed to be a male or a 

565
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:31,980
female?
Is it's supposed to be a sexual or is it

566
00:28:31,981 --> 00:28:35,370
supposed to be a nonconformist lean?
What is it?

567
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:40,580
Well,
it's supposed to be someone who who's 

568
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:40,580
gender isn't specified,
right?

569
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:45,350
Who is neither male nor female,
or maybe they say they say technically 

570
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:49,521
in the,
in the policy guidelines is anywhere or 

571
00:28:49,521 --> 00:28:53,421
nowhere on the spectrum,
and that's actually in the policy 

572
00:28:53,421 --> 00:28:53,700
guidelines in Ontario where or nowhere

573
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,570
and the nowhere.
I mean these are.

574
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,300
These are policies that are,
that are going to determine law,

575
00:28:58,330 --> 00:28:59,980
right?
That within which the law is going to be

576
00:28:59,981 --> 00:29:04,981
interpreted.
I don't even know what nowhere on the 

577
00:29:04,981 --> 00:29:05,020
spectrum means.
I don't understand what that means.

578
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:06,930
Doesn't mean anything.
It's nonsense.

579
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:08,880
It's nonsense.
So you have.

580
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,830
So here's the options,
right?

581
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:16,070
There's someone who identifies with the 
opposite gender of their biological 

582
00:29:16,591 --> 00:29:18,240
birth.
So there's a man,

583
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,150
for instance,
who identifies as a woman,

584
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,030
everyone's cool with that.
Whatever your name is,

585
00:29:24,031 --> 00:29:29,031
whatever you would like to be called,
whether it's Wendy or Mike or whatever 

586
00:29:29,031 --> 00:29:32,751
it is.
That would be the noise that you want 

587
00:29:32,751 --> 00:29:32,751
people to make with their mouth.
That means you.

588
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:36,810
That's it right now,
whether you're a he or a she.

589
00:29:36,811 --> 00:29:39,120
Outside of that,
that's where things get squirrely.

590
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:44,210
So third person is the only issue.
The only issue is like say if we were 

591
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:44,710
talking to Jamie,
Jamie just decided to.

592
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,850
He's going to be Jamie now.
He still Jamie Jamie's girl's name too.

593
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:54,180
I know girls named Jamie so he could be 
Jamie and Jamie decides he's a woman and

594
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:56,740
now he wants to be called.

595
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,150
She was like,
okay,

596
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,130
okay.
She Alright Jamie.

597
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:05,280
Now your she.
But when it gets to like xer and Z and 

598
00:30:06,191 --> 00:30:11,191
the 78 different gender pronouns,
it seems to a person outside of it 

599
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:15,250
person who's CIS gendered.
It seems pretty,

600
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:20,490
pretty bizarre and it seems pretty 
preposterous and it seems pretty 

601
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:21,940
indulgent and it seems like there's 
something else going on in this.

602
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,090
That's the thing.
It's,

603
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,590
it's something else going on park.
That is what concerns me.

604
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:30,640
There is something else going on in it.
If there wasn't something else going on,

605
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:35,950
I'm a relatively obscure professors,
amateurish youtube videos on a 

606
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:39,730
relatively obscure piece of Canadian 
legislation.

607
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,380
Wouldn't have had any effect.
Right?

608
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:43,230
It would have just disappeared,
right?

609
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:48,240
It didn't,
but you're not because there's more 

610
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,071
going on than than a straightforward 
issue surrounding the pronoun use and 

611
00:30:50,071 --> 00:30:54,721
everybody knows it or everybody feels 
that at least what it seems like from 

612
00:30:54,721 --> 00:30:59,131
someone outside of academia,
someone like me is it seems like you're 

613
00:30:59,131 --> 00:31:03,491
pushing back against something that they
are really trying hard to establish and 

614
00:31:04,871 --> 00:31:09,871
then it's some kind of control at some 
kind of control with how people behave 

615
00:31:10,601 --> 00:31:13,000
and communicate and it's not.

616
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:17,230
It's not like a societal thing.
It's a very small,

617
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:21,580
isolated group of people that seem to be
trying to indoctrinate others into their

618
00:31:21,581 --> 00:31:26,581
ways and they become.
They're becoming a very vocal and very 

619
00:31:26,581 --> 00:31:30,421
angry and verbally violent about your 
opposition to their controlling the way 

620
00:31:32,621 --> 00:31:37,621
they can that other people,
they don't like poking holes in the 

621
00:31:37,621 --> 00:31:38,610
radiology and the post.
The Post here,

622
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:41,170
we could lay it out quickly because I've
been,

623
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:46,260
I've been thinking about how to 
communicate this properly and so the 

624
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:50,311
thing about the postmodernists,
and I'm going to speak mostly about 

625
00:31:50,311 --> 00:31:51,970
Jacques Derrida because all consider him
in the central villain.

626
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:54,400
Now he actually,
he,

627
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:57,260
he may make a point explain who he is.
Well,

628
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,990
he's a,
he's a French philosopher,

629
00:31:58,991 --> 00:32:03,991
French intellectual who became quite 
popular in the late 19 seventies and 

630
00:32:03,991 --> 00:32:08,461
then was introduced to North America 
through the Yale Department of English 

631
00:32:08,461 --> 00:32:11,641
and of course English literature is one 
of the disciplines that has become 

632
00:32:11,641 --> 00:32:14,431
entirely corrupt.
And so Derrida wasn't Marxist to begin 

633
00:32:15,491 --> 00:32:20,491
with,
but that fell out of favor because it 

634
00:32:20,491 --> 00:32:22,480
turned out the Marxist political 
doctrine kept producing evil empires and

635
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:27,750
even radical left French intellectuals 
were forced to admit that by the mid 19 

636
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:28,380
seventies,
you know,

637
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:31,000
they'd put their head in the sand for 20
years,

638
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:35,890
50 years really thoroughly in the sand 
and made sure their ears were full too.

639
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:40,010
But by the mid 19 seventies,
the evidence that that was the case was

640
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:43,490
so overwhelming that even a French 
intellectual couldn't deny it anymore.

641
00:32:43,491 --> 00:32:46,460
And so they started to play sleight of 
hand with the Marxist ideas.

642
00:32:46,461 --> 00:32:51,461
So instead of trying to promote the 
revolution of the working class against 

643
00:32:51,651 --> 00:32:54,020
the,
against the capitalist class,

644
00:32:54,021 --> 00:32:57,260
let's say they started to play identity 
politics and said,

645
00:32:57,261 --> 00:33:02,261
well,
we can just separate everybody into 

646
00:33:02,261 --> 00:33:04,010
oppressed versus so presser,
but we don't have to do it on economic 

647
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:07,061
grounds.
And so we and we can call it power 

648
00:33:07,061 --> 00:33:07,061
instead of economics.
So that was part of it.

649
00:33:07,061 --> 00:33:11,771
And then the other thing about the 
fundamental critique that Derrida 

650
00:33:11,771 --> 00:33:16,030
focused on this is this is this is 
really worth laying out because that the

651
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:21,160
problem that he discovered,
the postmodernist discovered was 

652
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,010
discovered by a variety of other people 
at the same time in other disciplines.

653
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:27,490
So for example,
among the people who were studying 

654
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:28,970
artificial intelligence since the early 
19 sixties,

655
00:33:28,971 --> 00:33:33,971
it was always supposed that we'd be able
to make machines that could move around 

656
00:33:33,971 --> 00:33:34,340
in a natural environment without too 
much problem.

657
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:38,060
And the reason we could do that was 
because the world in some sense,

658
00:33:38,061 --> 00:33:40,010
was just made out of simple objects.
They are,

659
00:33:40,011 --> 00:33:45,011
they are.
And what you have to do is look at them 

660
00:33:45,011 --> 00:33:45,011
and you see them,
and that's vision,

661
00:33:45,011 --> 00:33:47,510
and then the complex problem is not how 
to see or what to see,

662
00:33:47,511 --> 00:33:49,820
but how to act in reference to what you 
see.

663
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:53,660
But it turned out that the AI people ran
into this problem,

664
00:33:53,661 --> 00:33:56,630
essentially sometimes known as the frame
problem.

665
00:33:56,631 --> 00:34:01,631
And the frame problem is,
is that there's almost an infinite 

666
00:34:01,631 --> 00:34:01,631
number of ways to look at a finite set 
of objects.

667
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:05,900
So the fact that that vision,
for example,

668
00:34:05,901 --> 00:34:07,250
it turns out to be way,
way,

669
00:34:07,251 --> 00:34:10,850
way more complicated than anybody ever,
ever estimated.

670
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:16,200
In fact,
you can't actually solve the vision 

671
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:16,200
problem until you solve the embodiment 
problems.

672
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:16,200
So,
uh,

673
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:21,560
an artificial intelligence that doesn't 
have a body can't really see because 

674
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,450
seeing is actually the mapping of the 
world on to action.

675
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:28,870
And so that was figured out more or less
by a robotics engineer called Rodney 

676
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:28,870
Brooks.
But,

677
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:33,790
but what's at the bottom of this is the 
idea that any set of phenomena can be 

678
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:36,890
seen a very large number of ways.
So like there's a bunch of pens in front

679
00:34:36,891 --> 00:34:37,990
of me here,
you know,

680
00:34:37,991 --> 00:34:42,991
and when I look at the,
my brain basically notes that there are 

681
00:34:42,991 --> 00:34:45,910
grippable object with which I can write.
So I see the function like,

682
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:48,080
like if you look at a beanbag,
you see a chair,

683
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:51,110
not because it's got four legs and a 
seat and a back,

684
00:34:51,111 --> 00:34:54,320
but because you can sit on it and,
and most of what we see in the world,

685
00:34:54,321 --> 00:34:59,321
we actually see functionally rather than
see as an object and then interpret the 

686
00:34:59,321 --> 00:35:03,311
object and then figure out what to do.
So the function of the object 

687
00:35:03,311 --> 00:35:03,680
constraints,
our interpretation.

688
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:06,020
But there's an endless number of 
interpretations.

689
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:11,170
So for example,
if I was going to paint that paint on 

690
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:14,351
canvas,
this set of pens and try to do it in a 

691
00:35:14,351 --> 00:35:16,900
photo realistic way,
I would be looking at tiny details of 

692
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:20,771
these objects that the multiple shades 
of red that are there and the multiple 

693
00:35:20,771 --> 00:35:22,580
shades of white and black.
And you know,

694
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:25,130
I would decompose it in many,
many ways.

695
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:28,490
And so the AI guys ran into this 
problem,

696
00:35:28,491 --> 00:35:33,491
which was that looking at the world 
turned out to be exceptionally complex 

697
00:35:33,491 --> 00:35:35,000
and that's still being solved now.
Okay?

698
00:35:35,001 --> 00:35:37,070
In literature,
the same thing.

699
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,090
What?
What

700
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:41,640
the postmodernists realized was that if 
you took a complex book,

701
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,700
let's say the Bible for example,
or a shakespeare play,

702
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:49,290
there's an endless number of potential 
interpretations that you can derive from

703
00:35:49,291 --> 00:35:51,720
it because it's so complex and so 
sophisticated.

704
00:35:51,721 --> 00:35:53,940
So imagine that.
Well,

705
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:57,330
you can interpret the word,
you can interpret the phrase,

706
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:00,000
you can interpret the sentence,
you can interpret the paragraph,

707
00:36:00,001 --> 00:36:05,001
you can interpret the chapter.
Let's say you have to interpret that 

708
00:36:05,001 --> 00:36:09,470
within the confines of the entire work.
Then have the entire tradition and then 

709
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:13,530
within the context of discussion that 
you're currently having and all of those

710
00:36:13,531 --> 00:36:16,380
things affect how you're going to 
interpret the play.

711
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:19,380
So there's an so that their conclusion 
was,

712
00:36:19,381 --> 00:36:24,381
well,
there's an infinite number of ways to 

713
00:36:24,381 --> 00:36:24,381
interpret a text.
And then their conclusion was,

714
00:36:24,381 --> 00:36:28,311
well,
there's an infinite number of ways to 

715
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:28,311
interpret the world.
And there's,

716
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:29,340
there's a way in which that's correct.

717
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:35,090
And so the next conclusion was,
there's no right way to do it so you 

718
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:37,530
could do it any old way.
And then their next conclusion was,

719
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,110
oh,
and this is where the Marxism creeped up

720
00:36:40,111 --> 00:36:41,040
again.
Oh,

721
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:45,540
people interpret the world in a way that
facilitates their acquisition of power.

722
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:50,010
Now that's where the bloody theory 
starts to get corrupt because yes,

723
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,290
a bit but also know,
right?

724
00:36:52,291 --> 00:36:54,270
Because,
and this is why they're wrong,

725
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,520
this is why they're wrong.
You see,

726
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:01,230
the world is complicated beyond our 
ability to comprehend.

727
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,690
So there is a very large number of ways 
you can interpret it,

728
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:08,990
but,
but you have to extract out from the 

729
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:13,851
world a way a game from your 
interpretation that you can actually 

730
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:19,131
play.
So if the lesson that you extract from 

731
00:37:19,131 --> 00:37:20,790
hamlet is you should kill your family 
and yourself,

732
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:24,540
then we might say that that's not a very
functional interpretation,

733
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:24,990
right?

734
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:27,660
Because first of all,
people are going to object to that,

735
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,820
right?
It ends your life.

736
00:37:29,821 --> 00:37:34,821
It ends many people's lives.
People are going to object to it and it 

737
00:37:34,821 --> 00:37:35,550
isn't a game that you can play over and 
over again in the world,

738
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:38,430
so when we're,
when we're interacting with the world,

739
00:37:38,431 --> 00:37:43,431
you see what we're trying to do is to 
extract out a set of tools that we can 

740
00:37:43,431 --> 00:37:47,361
use to function in the world because 
we're constrained by the world so that 

741
00:37:47,361 --> 00:37:50,670
we don't suffer too much and so that the
things that we need in order to continue

742
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:55,790
can be provided and we need to extract 
those out in a way that other people 

743
00:37:55,790 --> 00:38:00,261
will so that other people will cooperate
and compete with us in a peaceful and 

744
00:38:00,421 --> 00:38:03,000
maintainable way.
So then you think,

745
00:38:03,001 --> 00:38:05,880
well,
we have to extract out an interpretation

746
00:38:05,881 --> 00:38:10,881
that allows us to live and thrive over 
multiple periods of time in multiple 

747
00:38:11,131 --> 00:38:11,700
environments.

748
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:16,700
Well,
we're doing the same thing with other 

749
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:16,700
individuals who are motivated the same 
way.

750
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:21,440
So there's a tremendous number of 
constraints on our interpretations and 

751
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:21,960
the postmodernists don't care about that
at all.

752
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,370
All they do is say,
well,

753
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:24,330
no,
no.

754
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:27,180
You can interpret the way the world,
the world any way you want.

755
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:32,390
All people are ever doing is playing 
power games based on their identity and 

756
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:35,410
there's going to be no crosstalk between
the power hierarchies.

757
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,260
It's not even allowed.
That's why they don't engage in dialogue

758
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:41,620
c just to talk to like let's say if 
you're a.

759
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:45,400
If you're a postmodernist just to have a
discussion with someone like you,

760
00:38:45,401 --> 00:38:46,870
you know,
a heterosexual,

761
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:50,530
what do they call the CIS gendered male 
of power,

762
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:51,540
you know,
and,

763
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,800
and white to boot.
It's like that's,

764
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:58,830
that's an evil act in and of itself 
because all you're doing by engaging in 

765
00:38:58,830 --> 00:38:59,230
dialogue with that person is validating 
their,

766
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,700
their power game.

767
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:03,760
That's all you see and this isn't,
this isn't,

768
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:09,030
this is no aberration,
that these people don't engage in 

769
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:09,430
dialogue,
that it's no aberration.

770
00:39:09,431 --> 00:39:11,710
It's built right into the philosophical 
system.

771
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:16,980
They regard the idea of the idea that if
you're in one power group and I'm in 

772
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:21,841
another,
the idea that we can step out of that 

773
00:39:21,841 --> 00:39:21,841
group,
engage in a dialogue,

774
00:39:21,841 --> 00:39:26,370
have our worlds meat and produce some 
sort of understanding of some sort of 

775
00:39:26,441 --> 00:39:28,960
negotiated understanding.
No,

776
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:33,250
that's part of your,
your oppressive patriarchal game.

777
00:39:33,251 --> 00:39:35,920
That idea,
that whole idea is part of your game,

778
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:40,030
so if I even engage in the dialogue,
I'm playing your game,

779
00:39:40,031 --> 00:39:43,930
you win.
It's a complete as complete.

780
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:49,560
People don't understand that 
postmodernism is a complete assault on 

781
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:53,581
two things.
One is it's an assault on the 

782
00:39:53,581 --> 00:39:56,491
metaphysical substrate of our culture 
and I would say that the metaphysical 

783
00:39:56,491 --> 00:39:57,570
substrate looks something like a 
religious substrate,

784
00:39:57,610 --> 00:40:02,610
so it's a direct assault on that,
and the second thing it's an assault on 

785
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:03,670
is everything that's been established 
since the enlightenment,

786
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:05,260
rationality,
empiricism,

787
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:07,300
science,
everything,

788
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:09,010
clarity of mind,
dialogue,

789
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,770
the idea of the individual,
all of that is,

790
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:16,810
is not only you'd see,
it's not only that it's up for grabs,

791
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:17,860
that's not the thing.

792
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:22,000
It's to be destroyed.
That's the goal,

793
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:24,620
to be destroyed.
Just like the Communists wanted,

794
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:25,140
you know,
one,

795
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:27,670
the revolution to destroy the capitalist
system.

796
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,820
It's the same thing.
These people now you might say,

797
00:40:30,821 --> 00:40:35,821
well,
because every social justice warrior 

798
00:40:35,821 --> 00:40:35,821
activist know this,
it's like,

799
00:40:35,821 --> 00:40:35,821
well,
no,

800
00:40:35,821 --> 00:40:36,760
of course not.
It's not.

801
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:41,940
Not Anymore than any.
Every Muslim knows the entire Muslim 

802
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:45,241
doctrine or Islamic doctrine or every 
Christian knows the entire Christian 

803
00:40:45,241 --> 00:40:45,241
doctrine.
You know,

804
00:40:45,241 --> 00:40:48,070
it's fragmented among people,
but then when you bring them together,

805
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:51,280
the fragments unite and the entire 
philosophy acts itself out,

806
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:56,600
so you don't think that this is a 
nefarious plot by a few well planned out

807
00:40:56,611 --> 00:41:01,611
individuals that have some sort of an 
agenda that they're going to promote 

808
00:41:01,711 --> 00:41:03,930
this ideology because they and they 
understand what they're doing.

809
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:09,010
You feel like it's what you're saying,
that there's a bunch of different 

810
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:10,130
factions,
bunch of,

811
00:41:10,131 --> 00:41:15,131
bunch of different parts to this,
and it could be a lot of it is that 

812
00:41:15,131 --> 00:41:18,960
people feel disenfranchised socially.
They,

813
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:24,010
they are empowered by their positions in
universities and by these insulated 

814
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:29,300
environments and groups,
they're intoxicated by the power that 

815
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:32,490
they have over young people and shaping 
their minds and,

816
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:32,990
and,
and,

817
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:38,030
and imposing their ideologies.
They receive feedback from these kids.

818
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:40,700
It builds up,
everything strengthens.

819
00:41:40,701 --> 00:41:45,701
They shore up the walls around them and 
they pushed this forward and then when 

820
00:41:45,701 --> 00:41:49,271
they have something like this speech 
that you gave at mcmasters and they get 

821
00:41:49,271 --> 00:41:50,600
to actually act,
it unites them.

822
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:54,080
That unites them and this is what you're
getting from this glazed eye,

823
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:54,870
you know?

824
00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:56,000
Yeah,
yeah.

825
00:41:56,010 --> 00:41:57,370
Well,
well it's,

826
00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:00,330
it's as if it's like Richard Dawkins 
idea of meme.

827
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:02,670
You know,
if you imagine that in your,

828
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:07,970
in your neuro neural structure,
whatever ideas that you're manifesting 

829
00:42:08,821 --> 00:42:13,440
are represented neuron by neuron.
Let's say it's a web of neurons,

830
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,350
not any one neuron has the entire idea 
set.

831
00:42:16,351 --> 00:42:18,990
This is obviously an oversimplification,
but you get the point.

832
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,260
There's a network from which the idea 
emerges.

833
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:27,470
Well,
the meme idea is is that an idea can 

834
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:30,480
rest upon multiple individuals as if 
each individual is a neuron,

835
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:35,900
and so I mean there are people who are 
more or less fully informed as to the 

836
00:42:38,371 --> 00:42:41,550
nature of postmodern doctrine and 
they're pushing it forward.

837
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:45,840
Consciously and unconsciously.
There are consciously pushing it forward

838
00:42:45,841 --> 00:42:50,841
and acting it out,
and so there are individuals who are 

839
00:42:50,841 --> 00:42:54,710
more representative of the entire set of
ideas and individuals who are less 

840
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:55,560
representative,
but if you get them together in a group,

841
00:42:55,890 --> 00:43:00,890
the thing that animates them and unites 
them is the common set of ideas and 

842
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:03,760
those ideas were produced by the 
postmodern French intellectuals in the,

843
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:05,700
in the mid seventies,
roughly speaking,

844
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:08,160
shocked Derrida,
Michel Foucault.

845
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:14,270
Foucault was the person who famously 
pronounced that psychiatric diagnostic 

846
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:17,850
categories were primarily social in 
origin rather than biological.

847
00:43:17,851 --> 00:43:19,260
And you know,
I read,

848
00:43:19,261 --> 00:43:24,261
flew close work pink.
It was madness and civilization where 

849
00:43:24,261 --> 00:43:25,830
he,
he advanced that particular doctrine.

850
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:29,340
You can actually read Fuko unlike 
Derrida and uh,

851
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:31,640
but I just found what he was writing 
obvious.

852
00:43:31,641 --> 00:43:36,641
It's,
I knew from my clinical training that 

853
00:43:36,641 --> 00:43:38,220
psychiatric categories have a heavy 
sociological construction,

854
00:43:38,221 --> 00:43:40,290
partly because psychiatry is into 
science.

855
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:44,190
Medicine isn't a science,
it's an applied science.

856
00:43:44,191 --> 00:43:46,190
Those aren't the same thing at all.
And you know,

857
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:51,200
a pure science is pure science that 
deals with scientific categories like 

858
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:54,750
Adams,
but an applied science.

859
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:59,960
Well,
it's a compromise between all sorts of 

860
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:02,121
different things and mental illnesses 
themselves are shaped by the social 

861
00:44:02,121 --> 00:44:03,210
environment.
Even though often they have a biological

862
00:44:03,211 --> 00:44:08,211
route,
the way they manifest themselves as 

863
00:44:08,211 --> 00:44:08,211
clearly shaped by society and language.

864
00:44:08,211 --> 00:44:11,880
I didn't find his work the least bit 
surprising.

865
00:44:11,881 --> 00:44:12,780
I thought.
Well really,

866
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:17,900
I mean everyone who's a sophisticated 
medical professional psychiatrist,

867
00:44:18,851 --> 00:44:20,850
psychologist,
everyone knows that.

868
00:44:20,851 --> 00:44:22,090
It's like,
I mean,

869
00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:27,370
there's a book called discovery of the 
unconscious by a guy named Henri 

870
00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:30,950
Ellenberger,
Jay that was written in the believe in 

871
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:32,451
the sixties,
great book on history of psychoanalysis 

872
00:44:32,451 --> 00:44:34,800
and like he covers the shift and 
diagnostic categories across time.

873
00:44:34,801 --> 00:44:37,740
It's self evident.
So anyways,

874
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,410
there's all these French postmodernists.
They were all marxists.

875
00:44:40,490 --> 00:44:43,380
Most of them were student 
revolutionaries in France in the late 19

876
00:44:43,381 --> 00:44:46,560
sixties before that all fell apart and 
they did two things.

877
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:51,680
They pulled out this frame problem,
issue the issue of multiple 

878
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:52,470
interpretations and said,
well,

879
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:55,680
there's nothing that's canonical.
There's no overarching narrative,

880
00:44:55,681 --> 00:44:59,130
there's no real interpretation.
And I already said why that's wrong.

881
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:03,300
And then the other thing they said was 
they did the slight of hand.

882
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,810
So instead of the working class against 
the verge was easy.

883
00:45:05,811 --> 00:45:10,811
It was,
it was race against race or gender 

884
00:45:10,811 --> 00:45:12,210
against gender.
Unbelievably divisive.

885
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:17,240
It's all they believe in his identity.
There's no individual man that's gone 

886
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:19,500
with postmodernism.
This isn't an accident.

887
00:45:19,501 --> 00:45:21,060
All of this stuff,
it's not random.

888
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:25,710
It's driven by these ideas,
like ideas are always at war always,

889
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:29,550
and we're in a war between these ideas.
I mean,

890
00:45:29,551 --> 00:45:34,050
Marxism we already know is tremendously 
powerful doctrine and this is its newest

891
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:39,530
manifestation.
What is the motivation behind the 

892
00:45:39,530 --> 00:45:41,460
individuals that are at the heart of 
this movement?

893
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:48,770
Well,
I would say that the motivations are as 

894
00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:50,460
complex as as human motivations are in 
general,

895
00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:53,550
but they seem to have solidified into a 
movement,

896
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:54,420
right?
Well,

897
00:45:54,421 --> 00:45:58,440
I think the dangerous part of it is that
the kind of.

898
00:45:58,470 --> 00:46:03,470
It's almost like a scapegoat mentality.
It's almost like psychoanalytic 

899
00:46:03,470 --> 00:46:04,390
projection.
That's another way of thinking about it.

900
00:46:04,391 --> 00:46:09,391
So like one of the things that I've come
to learn and one of the things I talk 

901
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:12,330
about a lot is that the battle between 
good and evil,

902
00:46:12,331 --> 00:46:17,331
so to speak,
isn't between states and it's not 

903
00:46:17,331 --> 00:46:21,350
between the individuals precisely.
Although it manifests itself at those 

904
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:21,350
levels.
It's an internal battle,

905
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:23,340
a moral battle that happens inside 
people.

906
00:46:23,341 --> 00:46:28,341
And so people have a broad capacity for 
malevolence and for and for benevolence,

907
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:34,280
and that's a terrible war for people and
it's a terrible thing to understand and 

908
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:34,680
realize.
In fact,

909
00:46:34,681 --> 00:46:39,210
often when people realize their capacity
for malevolence,

910
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:44,480
if they're not prepared for it,
they develop posttraumatic stress 

911
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:44,480
disorder.

912
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:45,750
So that happens to soldiers and 
battlefields.

913
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:48,150
So they go out,
they're innocent guys,

914
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,710
you know,
naive guys,

915
00:46:49,711 --> 00:46:54,711
young guys,
and they go out onto a battlefield and 

916
00:46:54,711 --> 00:46:55,020
they get put in a really stressful 
situation and you know,

917
00:46:55,021 --> 00:46:57,990
they,
they step outside themselves and they do

918
00:46:57,991 --> 00:47:02,040
something unbelievably vicious and 
brutal and then they're broken.

919
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:07,700
They can't take that manifestation of 
themself and put it with like Iowa Corn 

920
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:10,770
Fed,
you know,

921
00:47:10,890 --> 00:47:15,890
nice guy and no wonder because one is 
like a flesh eating chimp chimpanzee on 

922
00:47:17,761 --> 00:47:19,620
a war rampage.
And the other is,

923
00:47:19,621 --> 00:47:24,621
you know,
a relatively well brought up and polite 

924
00:47:24,621 --> 00:47:24,930
farm boy from the middle of the United 
States.

925
00:47:24,931 --> 00:47:29,931
It's like how in the world you're going 
to put those two things together while 

926
00:47:29,931 --> 00:47:30,310
you can't.
That's posttraumatic stress disorder.

927
00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:35,730
And to treat that,
my experience with posttraumatic stress 

928
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:36,580
disorder is that you have to teach 
people a philosophy of evil,

929
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:39,880
of good and evil,
because otherwise they can't recover.

930
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,020
And I've had.
I've had,

931
00:47:41,021 --> 00:47:43,060
by the way,
in the last four months,

932
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:48,420
I've had two letters from people from 
soldiers with ptsd and I met to 

933
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:52,500
personally who said that watching my 
lectures had had brought them back 

934
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:57,600
together because they couldn't 
understand how they had become before 

935
00:47:57,850 --> 00:48:00,520
looking,
looking deeply at,

936
00:48:00,730 --> 00:48:03,040
at the,
at their malevolence now.

937
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:05,770
So I would say with regards to this 
movement,

938
00:48:05,771 --> 00:48:09,220
this postmodern movement,
the malevolent aspect of it,

939
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:10,480
there's.
There's a couple of them.

940
00:48:10,481 --> 00:48:13,270
One,
it's unbelievably authoritarian.

941
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:16,210
Can I got a letter today from a 
university student in Italy,

942
00:48:16,211 --> 00:48:21,211
I don't know what university,
but she'd been having kind of a flame 

943
00:48:21,211 --> 00:48:23,680
war on facebook with a,
with a social justice warrior.

944
00:48:23,681 --> 00:48:28,681
And at the end she recommended that this
particular social justice warrior seek 

945
00:48:28,751 --> 00:48:33,751
out a local mental health counseling 
unit and put a link to it in the 

946
00:48:33,751 --> 00:48:34,060
exchange.

947
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:36,550
And then she got a letter from the 
university.

948
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:41,320
I guess the other person that sjw type 
turned her in,

949
00:48:41,530 --> 00:48:46,530
but she got a letter from the university
saying that that violated university 

950
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:49,951
policy and constituted harassment and 
that she should seriously consider 

951
00:48:49,951 --> 00:48:54,001
retracting it and that future employees,
employers might be looking at what she 

952
00:48:54,371 --> 00:48:58,140
posted and it was inappropriate to put 
that on a public site and it's like,

953
00:48:58,300 --> 00:48:59,770
I thought,
wow,

954
00:48:59,771 --> 00:49:03,550
if.
How could you be so clueless as a,

955
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:08,970
as a administrator say to think that 
your monitoring of your students' 

956
00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:14,580
private utterances,
you're monitoring it at an institutional

957
00:49:14,581 --> 00:49:19,581
level and your intervention and threat 
at an institutional level is less 

958
00:49:19,581 --> 00:49:21,610
dangerous than lending to students,
you know,

959
00:49:21,730 --> 00:49:24,160
troll each other on,
on a,

960
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:26,890
on a public social forum.
It's just,

961
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:29,560
I just,
I don't know what to think about it.

962
00:49:29,561 --> 00:49:34,561
It's just unbelievable.
It happened and it's happening all over 

963
00:49:34,561 --> 00:49:34,561
the place.

964
00:49:34,561 --> 00:49:37,090
This sort of thing.
And so there's the authoritarian element

965
00:49:37,091 --> 00:49:38,860
to it,
which is a hatred of.

966
00:49:39,070 --> 00:49:44,070
I think it's a hatred of competence 
because competence produces hierarchies 

967
00:49:44,070 --> 00:49:48,180
that aren't based on power.
I think it's a hatred of clear 

968
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:50,450
intellect,
hatred of clear interlink.

969
00:49:50,451 --> 00:49:53,010
How so?
What do you mean when you say clear,

970
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:56,320
but you have a clear intellect as far as
I'm concerned?

971
00:49:56,321 --> 00:50:01,321
I think that's why you're so popular is 
because you pay attention and say what 

972
00:50:01,631 --> 00:50:06,610
you see and you're not too concerned 
about doing anything other than that.

973
00:50:06,611 --> 00:50:06,980
I mean,
yeah,

974
00:50:06,990 --> 00:50:09,670
of course you have an agenda because 
everyone has an agenda.

975
00:50:09,671 --> 00:50:11,980
You can't help but have an agenda if 
you're alive,

976
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:17,250
but you can temper the agenda like you 
can be clued in enough to try to listen 

977
00:50:18,071 --> 00:50:22,510
and learn and watch and pay attention to
what your own senses are telling you and

978
00:50:22,511 --> 00:50:27,511
try to articulate that and that's what 
the logos is technically and the reason

979
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:33,100
I'm bringing this up is because Jacques 
Derrida described Western culture in a 

980
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:35,090
famous phrase.
He described it as

981
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,360
fallow fell,
logocentric,

982
00:50:37,361 --> 00:50:42,361
p h a l logo l o g o centric fell logo 
centric and it needs to be brought down 

983
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:46,000
while the Phallus part.
That's male.

984
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,610
The logo part.
That's logos.

985
00:50:48,790 --> 00:50:52,390
Now that's partly logic because the 
board logic comes from the word logos,

986
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,820
but logos is a deep mate.
Much,

987
00:50:54,821 --> 00:50:58,060
much older concept and logic like logos 
is.

988
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:05,110
It's essentially a theological concept 
and that's where things get complicated,

989
00:51:05,111 --> 00:51:10,111
but you could describe it as a,
as the manifestation of truth in speech 

990
00:51:11,410 --> 00:51:12,620
and the postmodernist.
They don't like

991
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:14,840
any of that.
So foul logo center,

992
00:51:14,850 --> 00:51:17,310
some Legos.
It would be the ultimate mansplaining.

993
00:51:17,430 --> 00:51:18,360
Yes,
exactly.

994
00:51:18,390 --> 00:51:22,710
Yes.
Like any man who expresses a or tries to

995
00:51:22,711 --> 00:51:27,090
correct a woman in any way becomes a man
claiming to correct anything in any way.

996
00:51:28,470 --> 00:51:32,340
Particularly with you where the Ted 
Cruz,

997
00:51:32,341 --> 00:51:35,670
Sally Yates testimony that's been going 
on in America.

998
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:37,660
Pretty fascinating because.
No,

999
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:42,680
I'm not aware of that.
I saw an example of that in Australia 

1000
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:45,421
and our congressional debate where a guy
was accused of mansplaining by one of 

1001
00:51:45,421 --> 00:51:47,760
his colleagues and really tore a strip 
off her quite nicely.

1002
00:51:48,150 --> 00:51:49,770
So what's happening in the states?
He will.

1003
00:51:49,771 --> 00:51:54,771
Yates has just been pretty brilliant.
She was fired by the trump 

1004
00:51:54,771 --> 00:51:57,790
administration because she rejected this
idea of um,

1005
00:51:58,860 --> 00:51:59,940
what was the,
uh,

1006
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:03,690
the very specific things about 
restricting immigration,

1007
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:08,780
about shutting down a different people 
that are trying to come into the United 

1008
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:08,780
States.

1009
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:13,820
And she had this debate with Ted Cruz 
where she just brilliantly shut him down

1010
00:52:14,310 --> 00:52:19,310
with her knowledge of the Constitution 
and knowledge of what is and what is not

1011
00:52:19,861 --> 00:52:23,250
legal or should or should not be allowed
to happen.

1012
00:52:23,251 --> 00:52:26,700
And she was fired for it and he was 
grilling her and his,

1013
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:28,650
you know,
he's a very smart guy,

1014
00:52:28,651 --> 00:52:33,651
ted Cruz.
Although I don't agree with him and I 

1015
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:33,651
agree more with her.
The wait was going down.

1016
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:38,391
This debate was described as 
mansplaining because it was a man 

1017
00:52:38,391 --> 00:52:40,350
talking to a woman.
It's just a recent example.

1018
00:52:40,351 --> 00:52:45,351
I also read about something like that 
with regards to the Supreme Court 

1019
00:52:45,351 --> 00:52:48,980
because somebody did an analysis showing
that the female Supreme Court justices 

1020
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:53,481
spoke less than the male supreme court 
justices immediately attributed that to 

1021
00:52:53,481 --> 00:52:57,171
sexism because you know,
how pressed female Supreme Court 

1022
00:52:57,171 --> 00:52:57,900
justices are.
So,

1023
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:00,120
um,
the,

1024
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,640
the,
the still want to get back to this,

1025
00:53:02,670 --> 00:53:07,380
that the hatred or the dislike of clear 
thinking.

1026
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:11,040
Yup.
Do you think that this comes from people

1027
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:16,120
that,
I'm not even sure I completely wrapped 

1028
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:18,441
my head around this,
but do you think this is from someone 

1029
00:53:18,441 --> 00:53:20,961
with a.
They understand that their logic is 

1030
00:53:20,961 --> 00:53:23,130
muddy.
They understand that they're imposing of

1031
00:53:23,131 --> 00:53:26,190
this muddy logic is illogical in some 
sort of a way.

1032
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:27,720
They feel it.
They feel it,

1033
00:53:27,790 --> 00:53:30,370
feel it rather than think it.
I mean,

1034
00:53:30,450 --> 00:53:35,450
that's the other thing is that there 
isn't a lot of clear thinking on the 

1035
00:53:35,450 --> 00:53:38,731
side of the social justice types because
a lot of what they're doing is real 

1036
00:53:38,731 --> 00:53:38,770
emotional,
emotional level.

1037
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:39,500
Yeah.
Well,

1038
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:42,100
they're the best personality predictor 
of,

1039
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:47,220
of,
of a politically correct belief because 

1040
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:47,410
we've done this study,
although it's not published yet,

1041
00:53:47,411 --> 00:53:50,140
is trait agreeableness,
agreeableness.

1042
00:53:50,141 --> 00:53:53,560
I would say the best way to think about 
it is that it's the maternal dimension.

1043
00:53:53,650 --> 00:53:55,900
That's an oversimplification,
but not much of one.

1044
00:53:56,200 --> 00:54:01,200
Um,
and so anybody that the maternal 

1045
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:04,831
viewpoint,
it's something like anybody who's part 

1046
00:54:04,831 --> 00:54:06,991
of my ingroup is an infant in trouble 
and anyone who's outside of it is a 

1047
00:54:07,570 --> 00:54:12,570
predatory snake or something like that.
And so you're seeing that manifest 

1048
00:54:12,570 --> 00:54:13,270
itself in a political doctrine.

1049
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:18,460
Well,
you clearly seeing that today with 

1050
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:19,060
what's going on with these,
like,

1051
00:54:19,150 --> 00:54:24,150
like say the Berkeley Milo rally where 
people who are on the left,

1052
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:30,860
who you would think of as being pro 
woman pro,

1053
00:54:30,861 --> 00:54:31,660
uh,
you know,

1054
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:36,780
antiviolence are more than capable of 
committing violence against women who 

1055
00:54:36,801 --> 00:54:41,801
support trump because then they 
categorize them as Nazis and we're 

1056
00:54:41,801 --> 00:54:45,311
supposed to punch Nazis and I mean 
there's been a bunch of instances where 

1057
00:54:45,311 --> 00:54:49,661
you've seen video footage of people 
getting pepper sprayed and hit with 

1058
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:51,170
sticks because they were wearing the 
wrong,

1059
00:54:51,230 --> 00:54:53,540
you know,
they're wearing or it wasn't even a make

1060
00:54:53,541 --> 00:54:55,130
America great again hat.
It was actually,

1061
00:54:55,131 --> 00:54:56,690
uh,
make bitcoin great again.

1062
00:54:56,691 --> 00:55:01,691
Hap.
There's a very famous video of a girl 

1063
00:55:01,691 --> 00:55:01,691
getting pepper sprayed.
Yeah,

1064
00:55:01,691 --> 00:55:04,840
I think I've seen that one fucking crazy
began by the left and by people who are 

1065
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:04,980
supposed to be,
you know,

1066
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,870
quote unquote progressive and people 
were supposed to be pro women's rights,

1067
00:55:09,170 --> 00:55:11,450
you know,
anti violence against women,

1068
00:55:11,451 --> 00:55:14,900
anti domestic violence,
but yet they have no problem doing it to

1069
00:55:14,901 --> 00:55:18,710
this other person because this person 
becomes the other because they're on the

1070
00:55:18,711 --> 00:55:19,250
other side.

1071
00:55:19,390 --> 00:55:19,870
Yeah.
Well,

1072
00:55:19,871 --> 00:55:24,610
this I was talking about this line 
between good and evil runs down people's

1073
00:55:24,611 --> 00:55:25,120
hearts.
It's,

1074
00:55:25,121 --> 00:55:25,510
well,
it's,

1075
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:30,620
it's a terrible fault line and it can be
shocking to see that it's the case and 

1076
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:35,251
so it's much more convenient for people 
to divide the world into the righteous 

1077
00:55:35,251 --> 00:55:40,171
and the and the damned let's say,
and then to to persecute the damned 

1078
00:55:40,830 --> 00:55:41,130
well,
it's.

1079
00:55:41,131 --> 00:55:45,550
It's convenient too because you whatever
resentment and hatred and bitterness you

1080
00:55:45,551 --> 00:55:47,320
have in your heart and you have plenty 
of that.

1081
00:55:47,321 --> 00:55:52,321
Generally speaking,
if you're a social justice type because 

1082
00:55:52,321 --> 00:55:54,751
you regard yourself as oppressed and 
then like that's a great starting point 

1083
00:55:54,751 --> 00:55:55,900
for resentment and hatred,
right?

1084
00:55:55,901 --> 00:55:57,580
To be,
to be a victim.

1085
00:55:58,810 --> 00:56:02,050
We know that that one of the precursors 
to genocide,

1086
00:56:02,051 --> 00:56:04,330
and I'm not saying at all that were near
that state,

1087
00:56:04,331 --> 00:56:07,990
I'm not saying that,
but one of the precursors to genocide in

1088
00:56:08,070 --> 00:56:11,500
a genocidal state or in a pre genocidal 
state is the.

1089
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:15,700
The acceptance of victim status by the 
eventual perpetrators.

1090
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,040
Because the idea as well,
like we're innocent,

1091
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:20,470
we're being persecuted now.
Those people are going to get us.

1092
00:56:20,471 --> 00:56:22,150
So eventually that becomes,
well,

1093
00:56:22,151 --> 00:56:27,151
we'll get them and it gives you have a 
target for all your resentment and your 

1094
00:56:27,151 --> 00:56:31,801
hatred and it's a justifiable moral 
target and so all the parts of yourself 

1095
00:56:31,801 --> 00:56:36,481
that you don't recognize as contributing
to whatever problem you think you know 

1096
00:56:36,481 --> 00:56:38,110
now pollutes the world.
You can ignore all that.

1097
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:43,170
You're on the side of the good.
There's no moral effort required and 

1098
00:56:43,170 --> 00:56:46,010
then you have someone to conveniently 
hate and hit and hurt and all the wild.

1099
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:47,770
You can look at yourself in the mirror 
and say,

1100
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:50,530
I'm,
I'm on the side of the good.

1101
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:52,360
I'm just punching Nazis.
Right,

1102
00:56:52,361 --> 00:56:53,290
right.
What is.

1103
00:56:53,291 --> 00:56:55,220
They're hitting them with bike locks.
You know,

1104
00:56:55,221 --> 00:56:58,870
while you dart out behind a woman who's 
conveniently standing in front of you,

1105
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:05,220
is there an evolutionary origin for what
we were talking about in regards to a 

1106
00:57:06,970 --> 00:57:11,970
soldier being able to commit these 
horrible atrocities in the name of war 

1107
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:17,520
to the these people that are able to 
look at someone who has a different 

1108
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:21,900
ideology as the other and attack them as
almost like a sub human is.

1109
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:26,920
Zero is some sort of an evolutionary 
origin for this disassociative sort of 

1110
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:29,290
thinking and behavior that some people 
seem to.

1111
00:57:29,390 --> 00:57:32,860
I mean it seems like a very common thing
throughout history.

1112
00:57:33,110 --> 00:57:38,110
Sure.
Anything that isn't part of your 

1113
00:57:38,110 --> 00:57:38,110
dominance hierarchies?
A snake.

1114
00:57:38,110 --> 00:57:43,030
It's that.
And it actually makes sense from an 

1115
00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:43,130
evolutionary perspective.
I mean,

1116
00:57:43,131 --> 00:57:46,640
first of all,
we are tribal primates,

1117
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:52,180
right?
And on our optimal group size seems to 

1118
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:54,461
be something like 250.
We can keep track of a boat that many 

1119
00:57:54,461 --> 00:57:54,461
social relationships.
And that's,

1120
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:57,110
that's also also number.
That's right,

1121
00:57:57,111 --> 00:57:59,120
exactly.
And that's correlated with brain size,

1122
00:57:59,121 --> 00:58:01,030
right?
So all right.

1123
00:58:01,050 --> 00:58:03,470
And so you might say,
well why that size?

1124
00:58:03,471 --> 00:58:08,471
And then you might say,
well hierarchy has to be optimized for 

1125
00:58:08,471 --> 00:58:11,330
two functions in one is what you want to
be able to climb the damn thing.

1126
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:13,250
So if it's really,
really big,

1127
00:58:13,251 --> 00:58:18,251
the probability that you're going to 
climb it is really low and if it's too 

1128
00:58:18,251 --> 00:58:18,251
small,
well who cares if you climate?

1129
00:58:18,251 --> 00:58:22,950
So yeah,
you want it somewhere that let's go big 

1130
00:58:22,950 --> 00:58:25,220
enough to climb and powerful enough to 
make the climb worthwhile.

1131
00:58:25,850 --> 00:58:28,940
And so and so there's some optimization 
there now,

1132
00:58:29,390 --> 00:58:33,650
so you might think of everything within 
that hierarchy as explored territory.

1133
00:58:34,130 --> 00:58:39,130
And the reason for that is that explored
territory is where when you do 

1134
00:58:40,370 --> 00:58:42,290
something,
you get what you want.

1135
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:48,960
So,
so think about the conditions under 

1136
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:48,960
which the limits of your knowledge 
manifest themselves.

1137
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:54,520
I mean,
there's also sorts of things you don't 

1138
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:54,520
know,
you know,

1139
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:57,291
a trillion things,
but you're not sitting there like 

1140
00:58:57,291 --> 00:58:59,700
torturing yourself to death because 
there's a trillion things you don't 

1141
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:02,251
know.
But then if you go out in the world and 

1142
00:59:02,251 --> 00:59:02,970
you act something out and the outcome 
isn't what you desired,

1143
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:08,000
then that registers an error.
So let's say you're at a party and you 

1144
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,520
tell a joke and no one laughs.
Well,

1145
00:59:09,790 --> 00:59:14,790
the party you see,
think about what happens to the space 

1146
00:59:14,790 --> 00:59:16,330
around the party.
When you tell the joke the second before

1147
00:59:16,331 --> 00:59:19,690
you tell the joke,
you're in one place and the second after

1148
00:59:19,691 --> 00:59:24,691
you tell the joke,
when there's an awkward silence and 

1149
00:59:24,691 --> 00:59:24,691
everybody's

1150
00:59:24,691 --> 00:59:24,740
looking embarrassed,
you are no longer in the same place.

1151
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:28,430
You've stepped outside the protective 
embrace of,

1152
00:59:28,450 --> 00:59:33,450
of that particular hierarchy.
And you've made yourself an alien and 

1153
00:59:33,450 --> 00:59:36,800
the thing that people use to process the
alien is the is the snake detector,

1154
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:39,470
the serpent detector,
the dragon detector,

1155
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:42,710
and it's always been that way because 
anything that's out side,

1156
00:59:42,810 --> 00:59:45,500
the hierarchy is a threat.
Any stranger,

1157
00:59:45,890 --> 00:59:48,230
any strange idea,
any,

1158
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:50,390
any,
any animal manifestation,

1159
00:59:50,391 --> 00:59:52,670
any noise,
any spirit,

1160
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:54,410
it's an.
It's a,

1161
00:59:54,530 --> 00:59:57,980
it's a threat to the integrity of the 
dominance hierarchy and in many,

1162
00:59:57,981 --> 00:59:59,510
many ways.
So for example,

1163
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:02,030
it's deeply rooted because that was your
question.

1164
01:00:02,090 --> 01:00:07,090
What's the evolutionary basis?
There's a great paper published in a 

1165
01:00:07,090 --> 01:00:10,241
journal called plause,
one p l o s one about five or six years 

1166
01:00:10,241 --> 01:00:14,480
ago looking at something absolutely 
terrifying in my estimation,

1167
01:00:14,481 --> 01:00:19,481
which was there's this,
there's this idea that part of what 

1168
01:00:19,481 --> 01:00:21,290
motivates the authoritarian end of 
political conservatism.

1169
01:00:21,470 --> 01:00:26,470
So let's say the right wing fascist end 
is associated not with fear but with 

1170
01:00:26,470 --> 01:00:30,611
disgust.
Disgust is an entirely different 

1171
01:00:30,611 --> 01:00:33,371
emotion.
And so these researchers did this 

1172
01:00:33,371 --> 01:00:36,191
fascinating study where they went to a 
number of different countries and also 

1173
01:00:36,191 --> 01:00:39,131
looked at states within the same country
looking at the relationship between the 

1174
01:00:39,131 --> 01:00:43,001
prevalence of infectious disease and 
authoritarian attitudes at the 

1175
01:00:43,001 --> 01:00:45,140
individual level.
The higher the infectious disease rate,

1176
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:47,330
the more authoritarian,
the political views,

1177
01:00:47,331 --> 01:00:49,010
and,
and the correlation was really high.

1178
01:00:49,011 --> 01:00:51,230
It wasn't like point one,
it was point seven.

1179
01:00:51,830 --> 01:00:56,830
It's one of the highest correlations 
between two phenomena I've ever seen in 

1180
01:00:56,830 --> 01:00:56,900
the social studies sciences.
And you might say,

1181
01:00:56,901 --> 01:00:57,680
well,
why?

1182
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:03,280
Well here's one reason I said that.
The strange idea and the stranger and 

1183
01:01:03,351 --> 01:01:04,460
the pathogen,
let's say,

1184
01:01:04,461 --> 01:01:06,170
are all the same thing.
Well,

1185
01:01:06,171 --> 01:01:08,420
it's all because they're external 
threats to the structure,

1186
01:01:08,430 --> 01:01:09,390
the dominance hierarchy.

1187
01:01:09,390 --> 01:01:09,870
You know,
when they.

1188
01:01:10,130 --> 01:01:12,230
When the Spaniards came to the new 
world,

1189
01:01:12,530 --> 01:01:16,460
95 percent of the natives died.
They died from smallpox.

1190
01:01:16,461 --> 01:01:18,620
They died from measles,
they died from mumps.

1191
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:23,860
They died from chicken pox because you 
don't know what the hell is coming at 

1192
01:01:23,860 --> 01:01:28,210
you.
When you let something new inside the 

1193
01:01:28,210 --> 01:01:30,041
dominance hierarchy,
whether it's an idea or a disease or a 

1194
01:01:30,041 --> 01:01:30,980
virus.
I think that was Laurie.

1195
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:34,610
No,
that was a heroin addict author.

1196
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:36,410
Boros Boros.
Yeah.

1197
01:01:36,411 --> 01:01:41,411
That was his phrase.
Laurie Anderson made a nice video about 

1198
01:01:41,411 --> 01:01:43,961
that.
Words are a virus and so we respond to 

1199
01:01:43,961 --> 01:01:48,011
them with the same circuitry that we use
to detect pathogens and I'll tell you 

1200
01:01:48,011 --> 01:01:51,941
something even more frightening when we 
were working this out because it's 

1201
01:01:51,941 --> 01:01:51,941
associated with this trait called 
orderliness,

1202
01:01:51,941 --> 01:01:54,650
which is actually a good predictor of,
of right wing political belief.

1203
01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:57,890
I went back and looked at Hitler's table
talk.

1204
01:01:57,920 --> 01:01:59,780
It's a book,
Hitler's table talk,

1205
01:01:59,781 --> 01:02:04,781
and he wrote that it was derived from 
notes that were taken by his secretary's

1206
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:09,940
between 1939 and 1942 when he was eating
dinner and spontaneously expounding on 

1207
01:02:10,580 --> 01:02:13,850
the structure of reality.
He was very open.

1208
01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:15,680
Hitler,
very creative person,

1209
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:17,890
but also extremely orderly.
Um,

1210
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:22,890
and I at the metaphors that he was using
to describe the Jews and the Gypsies and

1211
01:02:22,891 --> 01:02:25,440
all the other people that he burned and 
destroyed.

1212
01:02:25,441 --> 01:02:28,110
And it was all pathogen.
It's all pathogen metaphor.

1213
01:02:28,710 --> 01:02:31,530
The aryan race is a body.
It's a pure body.

1214
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:35,970
The blood is pure,
that Jews are rats or insects or or lice

1215
01:02:35,971 --> 01:02:40,971
or disease and so are the Gypsies and 
everyone else and they need to be 

1216
01:02:40,971 --> 01:02:43,530
eradicated in burned out essentially.
Here's something even more frightening.

1217
01:02:43,531 --> 01:02:45,810
So when,
when Hitler,

1218
01:02:46,650 --> 01:02:51,370
when Hitler took over Germany,
he was kind of a public health freak and

1219
01:02:51,380 --> 01:02:54,540
he will also washed his hands a lot 
every day and he was also a worshiper of

1220
01:02:54,541 --> 01:02:59,541
willpower,
so he was a really orderly guy and he 

1221
01:02:59,541 --> 01:03:03,741
started this public health campaign in 
Germany and he put together these vans 

1222
01:03:03,741 --> 01:03:06,450
that would go around like screening 
people for tuberculosis,

1223
01:03:06,451 --> 01:03:08,070
which you know,
is a perfectly fine idea,

1224
01:03:08,310 --> 01:03:13,310
but then they started a beautification 
program of the factories because he 

1225
01:03:13,310 --> 01:03:13,740
didn't like how messy the factories were
in Germany.

1226
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:18,740
So we had people clean them up,
sweep them out and plant flowers out 

1227
01:03:18,740 --> 01:03:21,660
front and,
and fumigate them for rats and insects,

1228
01:03:21,690 --> 01:03:22,800
right?
Parasites.

1229
01:03:23,070 --> 01:03:28,070
Oh.
And the Jews were always compared to 

1230
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:29,391
rats and insects as well.
They used cycle on b to do the 

1231
01:03:29,391 --> 01:03:30,340
insecticide.
Well,

1232
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:33,660
it's like long b.
That was the gas that was used in the,

1233
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:38,810
in the death camps.
So it went like pathogen insect rats 

1234
01:03:38,810 --> 01:03:40,800
that it went into the silence,
you know,

1235
01:03:40,801 --> 01:03:45,801
so.
So that people who were mentally 

1236
01:03:45,801 --> 01:03:45,801
deficient,
they were like parasites and rats,

1237
01:03:45,801 --> 01:03:47,640
and then it was Jews and Gypsies and 
parasites and rats.

1238
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:49,890
They were using Xy,
Colombian nods,

1239
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:52,060
icon a I,
I believe,

1240
01:03:52,061 --> 01:03:53,860
they were using cycle and be,
I don't know,

1241
01:03:53,861 --> 01:03:58,861
I know that the gas was Zike lawn or 
there is icon a was the gas that was 

1242
01:03:58,861 --> 01:04:03,391
formulated with a very extreme smell so 
that people would smell it and know 

1243
01:04:03,391 --> 01:04:06,070
because it was extremely toxic Zike on 
be.

1244
01:04:06,071 --> 01:04:11,071
It all came from Fritz Harbor Harbor was
the guy created the harbor method of 

1245
01:04:11,071 --> 01:04:13,210
extracting nitrogen from the oxygen that
we use for fertilizer today.

1246
01:04:13,690 --> 01:04:18,690
Harbor created Xy clon a and made it 
extremely toxic smelling so that you 

1247
01:04:19,781 --> 01:04:24,781
would know to avoid it Zyklon B,
that that whatever element was removed 

1248
01:04:25,270 --> 01:04:28,810
from the area so that it would be used 
in gas chambers.

1249
01:04:28,811 --> 01:04:31,660
They'd have no idea that they're being 
gassed proper.

1250
01:04:31,661 --> 01:04:36,661
Who was a Jew,
ironically did not know that his Zyklon 

1251
01:04:36,661 --> 01:04:37,030
a was eventually going to be used on his
own.

1252
01:04:38,130 --> 01:04:38,530
Yeah.
Well,

1253
01:04:38,531 --> 01:04:40,710
I,
I suspect they probably use cycle on a

1254
01:04:41,290 --> 01:04:42,110
locations,
you know,

1255
01:04:42,270 --> 01:04:43,740
but,
but the thing is,

1256
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:45,380
is that,
well,

1257
01:04:45,390 --> 01:04:48,180
so you know,
you said what's the biological basis and

1258
01:04:48,181 --> 01:04:52,710
the biological basis is that like we're 
basically wired in some sense also to,

1259
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:56,310
to for the domain of order or the domain
of chaos.

1260
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:59,310
That's another way of thinking about it.
The domain of order,

1261
01:04:59,370 --> 01:05:04,370
once again is where you are when what 
you're doing is working because see,

1262
01:05:05,371 --> 01:05:08,460
because our,
our environment isn't just natural.

1263
01:05:08,461 --> 01:05:10,980
It's also social.
So not only do you have to deal with the

1264
01:05:10,981 --> 01:05:14,460
vagaries of the natural world properly 
so that it gives you what you are aiming

1265
01:05:14,461 --> 01:05:16,290
at.
That's how you know if you're right,

1266
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:21,380
it gives you what aiming at but you have
to do it in a way that other people 

1267
01:05:21,380 --> 01:05:22,950
approve of and support.
And it's a very tight constraint.

1268
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:25,870
We talked about that as a constraint on 
the interpretation of the world,

1269
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:30,580
but then now and then something happens 
to disrupt that stability.

1270
01:05:30,580 --> 01:05:35,580
So that's like the white circle.
That's the black circle in the white 

1271
01:05:35,580 --> 01:05:35,650
serpent,
in the Yin Yang symbol.

1272
01:05:35,710 --> 01:05:36,310
You know,
how the,

1273
01:05:36,430 --> 01:05:39,980
how the white one that's order,
the white one has a black.in

1274
01:05:39,981 --> 01:05:43,840
it nets because chaos can come pouring 
through into order at any moment and you

1275
01:05:43,841 --> 01:05:48,841
have a circuit that detects that and 
that's the same circuit that detects 

1276
01:05:48,841 --> 01:05:50,890
snakes or predators and that obviously 
why wouldn't it be,

1277
01:05:51,390 --> 01:05:56,390
you know,
an intruding force and intruding forest 

1278
01:05:56,390 --> 01:05:59,371
has to be responded to right now.
So there's a need for a demand 

1279
01:05:59,860 --> 01:06:02,440
instantaneous response to sandy because 
most,

1280
01:06:02,470 --> 01:06:04,150
like you were saying,
of those kids,

1281
01:06:04,390 --> 01:06:09,010
like almost a unhuman or disassociative 
sort of,

1282
01:06:09,020 --> 01:06:12,850
uh,
the ability to act almost as if like,

1283
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:16,850
like something other than a person with 
a humanization.

1284
01:06:16,930 --> 01:06:18,120
Right.
And the Deq.

1285
01:06:18,380 --> 01:06:21,040
The thing is,
is another thing that's so funny is that

1286
01:06:22,210 --> 01:06:27,210
we think that the natural response to 
looking at a human being is 

1287
01:06:27,210 --> 01:06:27,210
humanization.

1288
01:06:27,210 --> 01:06:31,980
And that isn't right.
Like the default person in some sense 

1289
01:06:31,980 --> 01:06:35,880
isn't human.
The default member of your tribe is 

1290
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:35,880
human.
I mean,

1291
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:39,901
most tribes around the world,
the name for their tribe is the people 

1292
01:06:39,901 --> 01:06:43,750
implying that there are the people and 
all those other things out there are 

1293
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:47,461
barbarians right there.
There are forces of chaos are the 

1294
01:06:47,461 --> 01:06:48,760
stranger,
they bring disease in trouble.

1295
01:06:48,790 --> 01:06:53,790
Now,
I don't want to be too bleak about it 

1296
01:06:53,790 --> 01:06:55,651
because this is the basic debate between
conservatives and liberals to some 

1297
01:06:55,651 --> 01:07:00,271
degree is the conservatives take the 
stranger equals pathogen route more 

1298
01:07:01,451 --> 01:07:06,451
frequently and they're less attracted to
the idea of the free of or they work 

1299
01:07:07,810 --> 01:07:12,640
conventionally.
That trade with a foreigner has benefits

1300
01:07:12,641 --> 01:07:17,641
that outweigh the risks.
And generally speaking,

1301
01:07:18,731 --> 01:07:22,030
liberals have the opposite attitude.
So,

1302
01:07:22,170 --> 01:07:24,550
but that's because those two things are 
both true.

1303
01:07:24,940 --> 01:07:26,110
One is that,
man,

1304
01:07:26,111 --> 01:07:28,600
it's really useful to trade with 
strangers because they have all sorts of

1305
01:07:28,601 --> 01:07:31,390
cool things you don't have but be,
well,

1306
01:07:31,391 --> 01:07:36,391
it might be real dangerous because you 
don't know what those things are 

1307
01:07:36,391 --> 01:07:36,391
infected with.

1308
01:07:36,391 --> 01:07:37,930
Like realistically speaking,
let's say.

1309
01:07:37,931 --> 01:07:41,870
But then also metaphorically speaking,
here's an example of how,

1310
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:42,400
how,
uh,

1311
01:07:43,380 --> 01:07:43,960
how,
uh,

1312
01:07:44,140 --> 01:07:48,160
an object can be a virus.
I think about the automobile,

1313
01:07:49,180 --> 01:07:54,180
like if you wanted to introduce 
something into a communist country that 

1314
01:07:54,180 --> 01:07:58,060
screamed the paramount status of the 
individual,

1315
01:07:58,510 --> 01:08:03,510
you couldn't possibly create something 
that broadcast that more clearly than a 

1316
01:08:03,510 --> 01:08:04,510
car.
Right?

1317
01:08:04,540 --> 01:08:08,380
The car is driven by one person.
The person is completely autonomous,

1318
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:13,520
are completely sealed off.
They don't need any state support or 

1319
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:14,890
sanctioned whatsoever to move around in 
the car.

1320
01:08:15,230 --> 01:08:20,230
It's like if you want to do in.
If you wanted to rescue the communists 

1321
01:08:20,301 --> 01:08:25,301
from their collective pathology,
the best thing to do would be to 

1322
01:08:25,310 --> 01:08:30,310
parachute in automobiles because the 
automobile just screams individual 

1323
01:08:30,310 --> 01:08:34,301
autonomy and so when you,
when you get a an artifact from a 

1324
01:08:34,301 --> 01:08:39,160
foreigner,
you don't know what that's contaminated 

1325
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:39,290
with,
let's put it that way.

1326
01:08:39,710 --> 01:08:42,530
And so we have a circuit for dealing 
with that and it's a,

1327
01:08:43,010 --> 01:08:48,010
it's a,
it's the thing that associates the 

1328
01:08:48,010 --> 01:08:51,080
foreigner with the force that eats the 
sun when it sets at night.

1329
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:53,510
That's the most archaic way of thinking 
about it,

1330
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:56,810
but it's the snake or the Predator.
So,

1331
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:58,640
and what do you do with a snake or a 
predator?

1332
01:08:58,760 --> 01:08:59,810
Man,
you burn it,

1333
01:09:00,170 --> 01:09:02,180
you kill it,
you crush it.

1334
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:07,480
It's like there's a.
there's a destructive force that comes 

1335
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:07,480
along with it with that.
That's absolutely.

1336
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:09,610
Well,
it's morally righteous because yeah,

1337
01:09:10,220 --> 01:09:15,220
you know,
if it's a poisonous snake and it's 

1338
01:09:15,220 --> 01:09:17,951
threatening the village,
obviously you kill it and then you're 

1339
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:20,681
celebrated for it.
So in a sense the same dehumanizing 

1340
01:09:20,681 --> 01:09:25,150
force that allows people to act that way
in war also allows people to 

1341
01:09:25,731 --> 01:09:30,731
disassociate between anyone who doesn't 
agree with their ideology in a school 

1342
01:09:31,761 --> 01:09:36,761
setting,
in a university like what happened at 

1343
01:09:36,761 --> 01:09:36,761
Mclean.

1344
01:09:36,761 --> 01:09:36,761
Yeah.
That's why.

1345
01:09:36,761 --> 01:09:40,220
That's why I don't like it ecologies 
because the ideology does divides the 

1346
01:09:40,220 --> 01:09:44,831
world into those safely ensconced within
our dominance hierarchy and serpents.

1347
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:49,880
And so that's dangerous.
And,

1348
01:09:50,020 --> 01:09:55,020
and the reason that,
that this doctrine that I described 

1349
01:09:55,020 --> 01:09:55,670
about the line between good and evil 
running down the individual's heart.

1350
01:09:55,671 --> 01:09:59,690
I mean I got that particular line mostly
from Alexander Solzhenitsyn,

1351
01:09:59,691 --> 01:10:01,280
but it's also a,
it's a,

1352
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:06,520
it's an idea that's been developed 
intensively in the West for thousands 

1353
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:10,151
and thousands of years.
Maybe it's been developed since far 

1354
01:10:10,151 --> 01:10:13,571
before we.
We invented the stories in genesis 

1355
01:10:13,571 --> 01:10:15,350
because of course the serpent see in 
genesis,

1356
01:10:15,351 --> 01:10:17,630
of course genesis is like a paradise,
right,

1357
01:10:18,140 --> 01:10:20,720
so you can think about it as a well 
functioning hierarchy.

1358
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:23,000
It's also a balance between chaos and 
order.

1359
01:10:23,001 --> 01:10:28,001
It's got walls and it's a garden,
so but there's a snake that pops his 

1360
01:10:28,131 --> 01:10:30,020
head in and that's the same as that.

1361
01:10:30,620 --> 01:10:35,620
As I said,
that black dot inside the white serpent 

1362
01:10:35,620 --> 01:10:36,050
in the union symbol,
it's that no matter how,

1363
01:10:36,090 --> 01:10:40,310
doesn't matter how perfect the the 
environment is set up,

1364
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:44,120
something that doesn't fit is going to 
make its way inside.

1365
01:10:44,630 --> 01:10:47,150
It's one of the oldest stories of of 
mankind,

1366
01:10:47,151 --> 01:10:52,151
and you see the thing that makes itself 
manifest inside in the genesis story is 

1367
01:10:52,371 --> 01:10:55,370
a snake.
Now that snake turns out to be Satan,

1368
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:57,200
which is like,
how the hell does that happen?

1369
01:10:57,201 --> 01:10:57,980
It's a snake.
Like,

1370
01:10:58,010 --> 01:10:59,360
what?
Where does that come from?

1371
01:10:59,490 --> 01:11:02,030
It's not actually in the biblical 
writings to any degree.

1372
01:11:02,031 --> 01:11:04,160
It's part of the surrounding mythology.
Well,

1373
01:11:04,161 --> 01:11:08,360
it's partly because people started to 
figure out that the worst snake wasn't a

1374
01:11:08,361 --> 01:11:13,361
snake.
The worst snake was the snake that was 

1375
01:11:13,361 --> 01:11:16,631
inside a person because a malevolent 
person is way more of a threat than just

1376
01:11:16,951 --> 01:11:18,720
a snake,
like a snake wants to bite unit,

1377
01:11:18,721 --> 01:11:23,721
wants to eat you and all of that,
and and they were hell on are extremely 

1378
01:11:23,721 --> 01:11:25,860
primordial ancestors,
but we're.

1379
01:11:25,890 --> 01:11:30,000
The human race has been trying to figure
out where the threat is forever.

1380
01:11:30,150 --> 01:11:30,930
Well,
first of all,

1381
01:11:30,931 --> 01:11:32,340
it was external,
right?

1382
01:11:32,341 --> 01:11:34,200
It was all external.
It was the snake.

1383
01:11:34,201 --> 01:11:37,440
It was the barbarian,
but then it got localized to some degree

1384
01:11:37,441 --> 01:11:39,870
inside the individual.
It's like that's a bad person.

1385
01:11:40,050 --> 01:11:43,410
That person has a snake in them,
and then the idea kind of came out.

1386
01:11:43,411 --> 01:11:48,411
This is so cool.
The idea is that while the snake that's 

1387
01:11:48,411 --> 01:11:51,141
inside bad person a and the snake that's
inside bad person b is somehow the same.

1388
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:55,740
So that's where the idea of an 
articulated morality starts to come from

1389
01:11:56,070 --> 01:11:58,740
is there's an equivalence of evil across
individuals.

1390
01:11:59,670 --> 01:12:03,690
So then the idea of evil itself starts 
to become abstracted to at the same time

1391
01:12:03,691 --> 01:12:08,691
that the idea of good does well,
evil gets associated with Satan and 

1392
01:12:08,691 --> 01:12:09,210
Satan gets associated with the snake.

1393
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:11,670
It's,
it's mind boggling.

1394
01:12:11,730 --> 01:12:14,330
I mean,
these are how these chimps,

1395
01:12:14,340 --> 01:12:16,140
for Christ's sake,
you know,

1396
01:12:16,260 --> 01:12:19,440
it took us a long time to develop up,
say an ideal,

1397
01:12:19,441 --> 01:12:23,910
just to say the word.
An ideal implies a counter ideal say,

1398
01:12:24,030 --> 01:12:29,030
well,
those things were embodied way before 

1399
01:12:29,030 --> 01:12:29,100
they were ideas and after they were 
embodied,

1400
01:12:29,101 --> 01:12:30,570
first,
not as bad,

1401
01:12:30,571 --> 01:12:35,571
but as a bad thing or a bad person,
bad had to be extracted out of that.

1402
01:12:35,970 --> 01:12:39,000
And even that was extracted as a drama 
first.

1403
01:12:39,410 --> 01:12:41,010
You know,
it's like the bad guy in a movie.

1404
01:12:41,070 --> 01:12:43,980
He isn't a bad guy,
he's a composite bad guy.

1405
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:45,200
You know,
he,

1406
01:12:45,210 --> 01:12:48,780
he's,
he's a literary bad guy and the good guy

1407
01:12:48,781 --> 01:12:50,730
isn't just a good guy.
He's a literary good guy.

1408
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:53,340
He's a hero.
He's got way more heroic attributes than

1409
01:12:53,341 --> 01:12:58,341
the typical person.
And that's where abstract ideas are 

1410
01:12:58,341 --> 01:12:58,341
born.
So anyways,

1411
01:12:58,341 --> 01:12:59,850
back to your question,
the use,

1412
01:13:00,490 --> 01:13:01,970
you said,
um,

1413
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:07,400
what's the evolutionary basis for that 
sort of dissociative behavior and 

1414
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:07,400
thinking?

1415
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:09,450
Yeah,
so I'm afraid that that was a big rabbit

1416
01:13:09,451 --> 01:13:09,960
hole,
man.

1417
01:13:09,961 --> 01:13:14,961
No,
it's a great rabbit hole and it makes a 

1418
01:13:14,961 --> 01:13:14,961
whole lot of sense that there's an 
actual.

1419
01:13:14,961 --> 01:13:19,450
And I knew you probably knew this,
which is why I asked you that knew you 

1420
01:13:19,450 --> 01:13:23,031
had an answer rather that there is some 
sort of an evolutionary basis for that 

1421
01:13:23,031 --> 01:13:26,370
sort of be that ability that people have
to look at someone as the other,

1422
01:13:26,580 --> 01:13:31,580
you bet.
Well also how the hell are you going to 

1423
01:13:31,580 --> 01:13:31,580
respond in war if you don't have that,
right?

1424
01:13:31,580 --> 01:13:36,240
Like that was always an issue with 
people with invading tribes and like you

1425
01:13:36,241 --> 01:13:38,040
said,
with other external threats,

1426
01:13:38,041 --> 01:13:41,580
whether it was animals or insects or 
snakes or anything,

1427
01:13:41,581 --> 01:13:42,660
they could kill you.
Yeah.

1428
01:13:42,661 --> 01:13:43,560
Well I mean in,
in,

1429
01:13:43,790 --> 01:13:48,790
in a primordial situation,
I mean guys are in warrior mode a good 

1430
01:13:48,790 --> 01:13:50,790
part of the time and modern people don't
even know what that's like.

1431
01:13:50,850 --> 01:13:53,820
That's why they go out and they go into 
warrior mode and they get post traumatic

1432
01:13:53,821 --> 01:13:58,160
stress disorder because it's so unlike 
the way they configure themselves that,

1433
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:03,500
that they can't even,
they can't even bridged the gap between 

1434
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:03,500
the two identities and for,
um,

1435
01:14:03,570 --> 01:14:06,030
just for sake of clarity,
I think for some folks,

1436
01:14:06,540 --> 01:14:09,030
posttraumatic stress disorder is 
actually come from,

1437
01:14:09,060 --> 01:14:11,620
not just that,
but also from the threat

1438
01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:15,370
of being attacked from what I 
understand,

1439
01:14:16,300 --> 01:14:21,300
people like special ops people,
people like rangers and Navy seals and 

1440
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:26,281
the like are less likely to develop 
posttraumatic stress disorder because 

1441
01:14:26,281 --> 01:14:30,901
they're acting versus reacting that 
whereas people that are on that are 

1442
01:14:30,901 --> 01:14:32,410
going on like,
um,

1443
01:14:32,470 --> 01:14:37,470
patrol and then they get blown up.
Like those people apparently have a far 

1444
01:14:37,470 --> 01:14:42,240
more likely issue with posttraumatic 
stress disorder because they're 

1445
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:42,520
constantly worried about these external 
threats.

1446
01:14:42,940 --> 01:14:44,950
And then they,
when they come back to civilization,

1447
01:14:44,951 --> 01:14:47,950
they have a very difficult time getting 
back to baseline.

1448
01:14:48,010 --> 01:14:49,300
Yeah.
They're in prey mode.

1449
01:14:49,390 --> 01:14:51,520
Yes.
Very serious way.

1450
01:14:51,590 --> 01:14:52,260
Yes.
Yeah.

1451
01:14:52,370 --> 01:14:54,350
Yeah.
So it's not just acting,

1452
01:14:54,351 --> 01:14:59,351
but it's also reacting that the reacting
issue sometimes is even more problematic

1453
01:14:59,421 --> 01:15:01,250
for the individual than the acting mode.

1454
01:15:01,650 --> 01:15:02,360
Yeah.
Well there's,

1455
01:15:02,390 --> 01:15:07,390
there's,
there's a funny dichotomy there because 

1456
01:15:07,390 --> 01:15:07,950
very frequently if you're going to 
encounter a stress,

1457
01:15:08,130 --> 01:15:13,130
it's best to do it voluntarily because 
you use a whole different circuit used 

1458
01:15:13,130 --> 01:15:13,500
the approach circuit.
And so,

1459
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:16,840
I mean that sounds paradoxical what you 
just said because I said that,

1460
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:21,960
you know,
people often observe themselves doing 

1461
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:21,960
something to get posttraumatic stress 
disorder and then you said,

1462
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:26,601
well yeah,
but if people act they're less likely 

1463
01:15:26,601 --> 01:15:28,551
to.
But that's part of a more general 

1464
01:15:28,551 --> 01:15:28,800
phenomenon,
which is that in the face of a stressor,

1465
01:15:29,330 --> 01:15:34,330
you're,
you're better off cycle physiologically 

1466
01:15:34,330 --> 01:15:36,771
to act voluntarily.
It's either you're either going to be 

1467
01:15:36,771 --> 01:15:39,600
the thing that advances on the,
on the anomaly or its prey.

1468
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:42,510
Now that's,
that's roughly the way to think about it

1469
01:15:42,511 --> 01:15:47,250
and to be a prey animal is a terrible 
thing because it's doom.

1470
01:15:47,610 --> 01:15:49,710
It's paralysis.
Like literally speaking.

1471
01:15:49,740 --> 01:15:52,500
It's like in the Harry Potter series 
with the basketball is Greg,

1472
01:15:52,530 --> 01:15:54,540
you look at the basilisk and it turns 
you to stone.

1473
01:15:54,750 --> 01:15:55,410
Well,
why?

1474
01:15:56,370 --> 01:16:01,370
Well,
because that's what happens to a prey 

1475
01:16:01,370 --> 01:16:01,370
animal when a horrible Predator looks at
it,

1476
01:16:01,370 --> 01:16:02,550
it's frozen.
It's turned into stone.

1477
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:04,720
That's Medusa with all her snakes,
right?

1478
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:06,210
She looks at you,
man.

1479
01:16:06,211 --> 01:16:11,211
Mother Nature looks at you.
The the like the devouring part of 

1480
01:16:11,211 --> 01:16:13,530
Mother Nature opens her eye on you.
It's like you're paralyzed.

1481
01:16:13,830 --> 01:16:15,180
That's an old,
old story.

1482
01:16:15,660 --> 01:16:16,070
That is

1483
01:16:16,210 --> 01:16:19,960
really interesting thing that I never 
considered that my medusa does have this

1484
01:16:19,961 --> 01:16:23,650
head of snakes and she looks at you,
she turns you into stone and that is the

1485
01:16:23,651 --> 01:16:26,800
biggest issue with people.
It's not fight or flight.

1486
01:16:27,340 --> 01:16:29,290
People think it's fight or flight.
It's fight,

1487
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:34,320
flight or freeze.
The freeze thing is very common with 

1488
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:35,070
people and I've seen it.
I've seen it with people that just.

1489
01:16:35,220 --> 01:16:40,220
They don't know what to do when they're 
in a stressful situation and instead of 

1490
01:16:40,220 --> 01:16:40,240
reacting,
they freak out.

1491
01:16:40,350 --> 01:16:41,190
Yup,
Yup.

1492
01:16:41,250 --> 01:16:44,470
They freak out or they freeze so they 
just lock.

1493
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:49,600
Well,
you can see that if we go back to that 

1494
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:51,381
example of say someone tells a joke,
maybe they're kind of socially anxious 

1495
01:16:51,381 --> 01:16:53,130
and they finally managed to mumble out a
joke and it falls flat.

1496
01:16:53,460 --> 01:16:58,460
It's like to freeze.
The interface of that is very common 

1497
01:16:58,460 --> 01:16:58,800
reaction.
You know the personal freeze.

1498
01:16:58,801 --> 01:17:02,550
Then often they'll break into tears and 
run so well.

1499
01:17:02,551 --> 01:17:07,551
If they're socially anxious,
that's exactly what's happened because 

1500
01:17:07,551 --> 01:17:09,320
they've now they also know that they've 
been turned into a Predator,

1501
01:17:09,321 --> 01:17:14,321
let's say a snake Predator by the whole 
community and that's very shaming and so

1502
01:17:15,020 --> 01:17:15,510
that,
that,

1503
01:17:15,570 --> 01:17:17,810
that,
that is dumped on top of them.

1504
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:20,810
I mean that's socially anxious.
People are afraid of that all the time,

1505
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:23,660
that they're going to be regarded by the
group as an outcast.

1506
01:17:23,900 --> 01:17:24,810
Pariah.
Right,

1507
01:17:25,470 --> 01:17:30,470
and it,
it's very hard on people and the 

1508
01:17:30,470 --> 01:17:32,531
paranoid amongst them are always 
thinking that people are talking about 

1509
01:17:32,531 --> 01:17:32,531
them and trying to make them the other.

1510
01:17:32,531 --> 01:17:33,620
Right,
right.

1511
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:36,470
Yes.
A very uncomfortable state of mind.

1512
01:17:37,370 --> 01:17:38,870
Yeah.
This is a very.

1513
01:17:38,930 --> 01:17:43,130
I think this is a very important subject
and explaining it this way.

1514
01:17:43,131 --> 01:17:46,730
I think for the openminded,
whoever is willing to listen to this,

1515
01:17:46,731 --> 01:17:50,120
who maybe might have opposed some of 
your ideas before,

1516
01:17:50,121 --> 01:17:53,390
I think they'll get a better 
understanding of what's really dangerous

1517
01:17:53,391 --> 01:17:58,391
about this lack of dialogue and this 
lack of engaging in this shutting you 

1518
01:17:58,391 --> 01:18:01,370
out and making you the other as it were.
Yeah.

1519
01:18:01,371 --> 01:18:06,371
Well,
I mean it's what postmodernism is 

1520
01:18:06,371 --> 01:18:06,371
fundamentally concerned about.
They don't believe there's any other way

1521
01:18:06,371 --> 01:18:08,120
of operating in the world in that you 
see in,

1522
01:18:08,660 --> 01:18:13,660
and this is.
This is one of the things that I think 

1523
01:18:13,660 --> 01:18:14,990
Western civilization has contributed so 
brilliantly to,

1524
01:18:15,470 --> 01:18:18,860
to the expansion of knowledge and the 
world is,

1525
01:18:19,050 --> 01:18:19,790
well,
what's the.

1526
01:18:20,090 --> 01:18:23,030
What's the cure for the inadequacies of 
the group?

1527
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:26,090
While you might say it's the perfect 
state,

1528
01:18:26,390 --> 01:18:30,260
so one of the ways I'm going to do a 
series of lectures on the Bible starting

1529
01:18:30,261 --> 01:18:35,261
May 16th and for reasons that I outlined
to some degree when I was talking about 

1530
01:18:35,261 --> 01:18:38,450
genesis a little bit earlier,
but in the old testament for example,

1531
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:43,840
the Israelites are always trying to make
their peace with God so they're trying 

1532
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:47,021
to live in the world without getting 
walloped constantly by natural events 

1533
01:18:47,021 --> 01:18:49,010
and by you know,
invading forces and which they attribute

1534
01:18:49,011 --> 01:18:49,910
to God's will.
Yes,

1535
01:18:49,911 --> 01:18:52,160
yes.
Whatever's beyond their understanding.

1536
01:18:52,161 --> 01:18:55,100
In some sense they're more sophisticated
than merely this,

1537
01:18:55,101 --> 01:18:57,200
but whatever's beyond their 
understanding,

1538
01:18:57,410 --> 01:19:02,410
but they're kind of conceptualizing 
being as such and trying to figure out 

1539
01:19:02,410 --> 01:19:06,161
how to deal with it and one of the 
hypothesis they come up with is 

1540
01:19:06,161 --> 01:19:06,161
something like,
well,

1541
01:19:06,161 --> 01:19:08,660
you can bargain with it and the thing is
you can.

1542
01:19:08,750 --> 01:19:13,750
That's one of the things that's so cool 
and partly the reason you can bargain 

1543
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:17,411
with reality is because the reality that
you encounter as you move forward in 

1544
01:19:17,571 --> 01:19:22,340
time is partly the world,
but partly the abstract social system.

1545
01:19:22,940 --> 01:19:27,350
And so you can bargain with the future 
abstract social system all the time.

1546
01:19:27,351 --> 01:19:29,090
You do that every time you make a 
promise,

1547
01:19:29,450 --> 01:19:32,360
you do it every time you sacrifice one 
thing for another.

1548
01:19:32,590 --> 01:19:37,590
So you forego an impulsive temptation 
and that gives you a moral claim that 

1549
01:19:37,761 --> 01:19:40,040
you can redeem in the future that 
happens,

1550
01:19:40,041 --> 01:19:41,990
all that.
That's what money is for God's sake.

1551
01:19:41,991 --> 01:19:45,170
And we discovered the future at some 
point,

1552
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:46,970
as I said,
we were chimpanzees.

1553
01:19:46,971 --> 01:19:48,470
At one point,
we discovered the future.

1554
01:19:48,471 --> 01:19:53,471
Then we discovered that you could 
bargain with the future as if it was a 

1555
01:19:53,471 --> 01:19:54,470
person that's amazing.
It's amazing.

1556
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:57,530
And that's partly where the idea of God 
as a personality came from.

1557
01:19:57,770 --> 01:20:02,770
I should flip that,
that idea that you could bargain with 

1558
01:20:02,770 --> 01:20:07,330
the future came out of the idea that God
was a personality because the God as a 

1559
01:20:07,330 --> 01:20:08,130
personality idea came first.

1560
01:20:08,310 --> 01:20:08,780
But it was,
uh,

1561
01:20:08,910 --> 01:20:09,360
it was,
uh,

1562
01:20:09,660 --> 01:20:14,660
it was a developmental stage on the way 
to even being able to say the future.

1563
01:20:15,770 --> 01:20:16,330
You know,
we,

1564
01:20:16,340 --> 01:20:21,340
we have no idea how to say,
like a 6 million year path from 

1565
01:20:21,340 --> 01:20:22,800
chimpanzee to,
to self aware human being.

1566
01:20:23,430 --> 01:20:24,510
You know,
and we don't,

1567
01:20:24,511 --> 01:20:29,511
we have no idea where these unbelievably
sophisticated ideas that we have come 

1568
01:20:29,511 --> 01:20:29,880
from,
like the idea of sacrifice.

1569
01:20:30,030 --> 01:20:35,030
Do you know how much blood was spilled 
before human beings were able to 

1570
01:20:35,030 --> 01:20:37,230
sacrifice abstractly instead of killing 
something?

1571
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:41,790
We had to act out.
God enjoys you killing something because

1572
01:20:41,940 --> 01:20:46,940
he's happy with the blood.
We had to act that out for God who 

1573
01:20:46,940 --> 01:20:47,400
knows?
Twenty thousand years,

1574
01:20:47,550 --> 01:20:52,550
100,000
years before we got anywhere near the 

1575
01:20:52,550 --> 01:20:55,431
idea that you could do that abstractly.
So when I look at these old stories,

1576
01:20:56,041 --> 01:20:58,830
I look at them like an evolutionary 
biologist.

1577
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:03,920
Now I'm not trying to reduce them in any
way because what we don't understand 

1578
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:05,340
about evolution that could make a very 
thick book.

1579
01:21:05,670 --> 01:21:10,670
And there's other strange things about 
religious phenomenology that we don't 

1580
01:21:10,670 --> 01:21:10,740
have a clue about.
You know,

1581
01:21:10,741 --> 01:21:13,950
like the fact that the drugs often 
called entheogens.

1582
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:18,450
Psychedelics can reliably produce 
mystical experiences like no one has any

1583
01:21:18,451 --> 01:21:21,180
idea what to make of that.
You can just discounted.

1584
01:21:21,240 --> 01:21:21,810
It's like,
yeah,

1585
01:21:21,811 --> 01:21:23,430
well they're drugs.
Yeah,

1586
01:21:23,460 --> 01:21:28,460
sure.
People been using the things for who 

1587
01:21:28,460 --> 01:21:28,460
knows,
50,000

1588
01:21:28,460 --> 01:21:29,430
years.
One hundred and 50,000

1589
01:21:29,431 --> 01:21:34,431
years,
they might be the source of all our 

1590
01:21:34,431 --> 01:21:34,431
religious ideas.
I don't.

1591
01:21:34,431 --> 01:21:38,300
I'm not saying that they are,
but they could well be and so why do we 

1592
01:21:38,300 --> 01:21:41,900
have a capacity for mystical experience?
Who knows it?

1593
01:21:41,970 --> 01:21:44,070
It's it's associated with a sense of 
awe.

1594
01:21:44,071 --> 01:21:49,071
It's associated with the same feeling 
that you get when you listen to 

1595
01:21:49,071 --> 01:21:51,981
particularly dramatic music or when or 
when something moves you deeply and you 

1596
01:21:52,411 --> 01:21:54,480
know the hair on the back of your neck 
stands up.

1597
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:56,640
You know what that is?
That's Pilau erection.

1598
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:02,000
That's the same thing that happens to a 
cat when it looks at a particularly big 

1599
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:05,001
dog.
It's all you feel that when there's a 

1600
01:22:05,001 --> 01:22:06,750
swell of music off,
you're the hair stands up on the back of

1601
01:22:06,751 --> 01:22:11,751
your neck.
It's like you pop up just like a cat 

1602
01:22:11,751 --> 01:22:13,821
except like a bald cat.
So what do you make of this idea that,

1603
01:22:14,701 --> 01:22:15,690
well,
not the idea,

1604
01:22:15,691 --> 01:22:20,190
but the reality that these entheogens 
closely mimic human neurochemistry,

1605
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:23,000
know what they do.
There's absolutely no doubt about it.

1606
01:22:23,070 --> 01:22:24,690
What do you think the reason for that 
is?

1607
01:22:25,370 --> 01:22:26,720
Well,
a part of the reason is,

1608
01:22:26,721 --> 01:22:30,450
is that we share an evolutionary pathway
with all these things that we eat,

1609
01:22:30,810 --> 01:22:33,270
plants and fungi,
and you know,

1610
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:35,090
look,
we're,

1611
01:22:35,091 --> 01:22:38,820
we're linked evolutionarily to every 
form of life on the planet,

1612
01:22:38,850 --> 01:22:39,700
you know,
and,

1613
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:44,840
and like Serotonin in lobsters has the 
same effect on lobsters as it does on 

1614
01:22:45,730 --> 01:22:46,350
human being.

1615
01:22:46,350 --> 01:22:48,780
So if you up their serotonin levels 
artificially,

1616
01:22:48,781 --> 01:22:52,350
the lobster gets,
stands up more erect and stronger and as

1617
01:22:52,351 --> 01:22:55,790
much more willing to fight.
And if you decrease the serotonin in the

1618
01:22:55,791 --> 01:22:56,850
lobsters,
nervous system,

1619
01:22:56,851 --> 01:22:59,770
then it gets all depressed and runs away
and hides things.

1620
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:01,260
Think about that.
I mean,

1621
01:23:01,261 --> 01:23:06,261
we,
we split off from lobster about 350 

1622
01:23:06,261 --> 01:23:06,670
million years ago and still live in 
dominance hierarchies.

1623
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:08,890
That's how old the dominance hierarchy 
is.

1624
01:23:09,630 --> 01:23:12,790
There's plan that's older than trees.
It's older than flowers.

1625
01:23:13,390 --> 01:23:14,410
It's permanent,
right?

1626
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:18,610
We've evolved for the hierarchy and in 
the spirit of the hierarchy,

1627
01:23:18,611 --> 01:23:20,620
that's,
that's the Old Testament God,

1628
01:23:20,621 --> 01:23:23,200
that's at least part of it,
the spirit of the hierarchy.

1629
01:23:24,190 --> 01:23:27,130
So these things are,
while they're mind boggling to me,

1630
01:23:27,131 --> 01:23:28,870
which is partly why I'm investigating 
them,

1631
01:23:29,260 --> 01:23:31,390
but all of our wiring is conditional on 
that.

1632
01:23:32,110 --> 01:23:35,170
So what I mean women use the dominance 
hierarchy to select mates.

1633
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:39,730
So it's so strange because you know,
people think of evolution from a natural

1634
01:23:39,731 --> 01:23:44,020
selection perspective almost always,
but sexual selection plays a huge role.

1635
01:23:44,021 --> 01:23:46,210
So here all layout something wild for 
you.

1636
01:23:46,211 --> 01:23:51,211
Okay?
So we know that you have twice as many 

1637
01:23:51,490 --> 01:23:55,540
female ancestors as male ancestors.
Now people have a hard time with that,

1638
01:23:55,541 --> 01:23:58,630
but you could imagine that roughly 
speaking,

1639
01:23:58,631 --> 01:24:03,631
that would happen if every single woman 
had one baby and only every second man 

1640
01:24:03,631 --> 01:24:05,170
fathered a child.
So for men it would be,

1641
01:24:05,380 --> 01:24:07,810
you either have two kids are zero.
Well,

1642
01:24:07,811 --> 01:24:10,090
that's basically what it is on average 
across type.

1643
01:24:10,420 --> 01:24:12,040
If you're a man,
you have two children,

1644
01:24:12,220 --> 01:24:15,490
maybe with two different women or zero.
If you're a woman,

1645
01:24:15,580 --> 01:24:17,740
everyone has one.
That's how it averages out.

1646
01:24:18,130 --> 01:24:22,150
So there's more disparity of success 
among men.

1647
01:24:22,151 --> 01:24:24,280
And that's very common in the animal 
kingdom by the way.

1648
01:24:24,850 --> 01:24:27,970
Now the question is how to women select 
their mates?

1649
01:24:28,420 --> 01:24:30,430
Now,
unlike female chimps,

1650
01:24:30,460 --> 01:24:34,840
female humans are choosy maters.
Female chimps will meet with any chimp.

1651
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:37,060
They go into heat,
they'll meet with any chimp.

1652
01:24:37,450 --> 01:24:39,340
The dominant males are more likely to 
mate with them,

1653
01:24:39,341 --> 01:24:41,190
but that's because they chase away the 
subordinates.

1654
01:24:41,380 --> 01:24:43,360
It's not because the females exercise 
choice,

1655
01:24:43,510 --> 01:24:48,510
human females exercise choice,
and that's one of the things that 

1656
01:24:48,510 --> 01:24:50,050
differentiated us from chimpanzees,
but how do they do it?

1657
01:24:50,590 --> 01:24:55,590
Well,
they look at the male dominance 

1658
01:24:55,590 --> 01:24:55,590
hierarchy and that's where the men are 
competing.

1659
01:24:55,590 --> 01:24:57,580
Now you could say they're competing for 
power,

1660
01:24:57,940 --> 01:25:01,360
but that's pretty corrupt way of looking
at it like they're competing for,

1661
01:25:01,361 --> 01:25:06,361
let's say influence.
They're competing for leadership and so 

1662
01:25:06,361 --> 01:25:08,500
in some sense the people at the top of 
the hierarchy,

1663
01:25:08,501 --> 01:25:10,720
if they're men,
are elected by the other band.

1664
01:25:10,780 --> 01:25:13,810
Now I know there was brutes and there's 
predators and all of that,

1665
01:25:13,811 --> 01:25:16,360
but I'm talking on average across time.

1666
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:21,720
It's like the men organized themselves 
and there are influential men that rise 

1667
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:24,940
to the top and the women take them.
Now we think about that.

1668
01:25:25,270 --> 01:25:30,270
What that means is that over the 
millions of years that a dominance 

1669
01:25:30,270 --> 01:25:33,190
hierarchy with those properties existed.
So let's say since we split from chimps,

1670
01:25:33,191 --> 01:25:38,191
let's say that 6 million years,
that means that the male dominance 

1671
01:25:38,191 --> 01:25:42,601
hierarchy is the environment that pushes
the mating mail to the top.

1672
01:25:43,210 --> 01:25:47,440
So that means the mail that's most 
likely to take precedence in the dorm in

1673
01:25:47,441 --> 01:25:52,441
the male dominance hierarchy is the one 
most likely to leave a genetic 

1674
01:25:52,441 --> 01:25:55,620
contribution.
So that means that the male dominance 

1675
01:25:55,620 --> 01:25:58,321
hierarchies,
a selection mechanism mediated by the 

1676
01:25:58,321 --> 01:26:01,081
female.
So what that means is that as we've 

1677
01:26:01,081 --> 01:26:02,200
moved forward through 6 million years of
time,

1678
01:26:02,740 --> 01:26:05,000
men have become more and more well 
adopted,

1679
01:26:05,001 --> 01:26:07,550
not only to the presence of the male 
dominance hierarchy,

1680
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:09,390
but to the ability to move up it.

1681
01:26:10,280 --> 01:26:12,980
And that's the central spirit.
You could say in some sense,

1682
01:26:13,010 --> 01:26:14,810
that's the central spirit of the 
individual.

1683
01:26:15,110 --> 01:26:17,120
The individual is the thing that can 
move up.

1684
01:26:17,121 --> 01:26:20,030
Dominance hierarchies.
It's the thing that's at the top.

1685
01:26:20,890 --> 01:26:24,440
It's the eye at the top of the pyramid 
and it's been selected for.

1686
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:29,800
And then what's happened is we've 
watched so we get better and better and 

1687
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:33,491
better for biological reasons,
culturally mediated at figuring out how 

1688
01:26:34,371 --> 01:26:39,371
to climb across a set of dominance 
hierarchy so we can leave a genetic 

1689
01:26:39,371 --> 01:26:39,890
contribution.
That's what's happened to human beings.

1690
01:26:40,190 --> 01:26:42,950
Now imagine that that's happened for 6 
million years.

1691
01:26:43,190 --> 01:26:48,190
So now imagine that.
We started to watch that because we're 

1692
01:26:48,190 --> 01:26:48,590
curious creatures.
We're always trying to figure out who we

1693
01:26:48,591 --> 01:26:51,800
are.
And then as we watched that,

1694
01:26:51,801 --> 01:26:56,801
we started to tell stories about what 
the people who could climb the 

1695
01:26:56,801 --> 01:26:57,050
hierarchies were like those were heroes.

1696
01:26:57,450 --> 01:27:02,450
That's where Harold mythology came from.
And the biggest hero is the person will 

1697
01:27:02,450 --> 01:27:02,810
go out and killed a snake.
Well,

1698
01:27:02,811 --> 01:27:05,870
unsurprisingly,
because that was a big hero man.

1699
01:27:06,710 --> 01:27:09,170
And maybe when we living in trees,
that was a hero.

1700
01:27:09,980 --> 01:27:12,530
So the big hero is the person who goes 
out,

1701
01:27:12,680 --> 01:27:14,810
slays the dragon,
gets the gold,

1702
01:27:14,840 --> 01:27:16,850
brings it back to the community and 
distributed.

1703
01:27:17,030 --> 01:27:19,880
He's also the person most likely to go 
up the dominant Turkey.

1704
01:27:20,330 --> 01:27:22,520
He's the person most likely to find the 
virgin,

1705
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:24,650
right?
Because it's a virgin that you free from

1706
01:27:24,651 --> 01:27:27,800
the dragon and you get to claim her 
right,

1707
01:27:28,700 --> 01:27:33,700
and so the dominance hierarchy is a 
mechanism that selects heroes and then 

1708
01:27:33,700 --> 01:27:36,300
breeds them.
And so then we watched that for $6,

1709
01:27:36,301 --> 01:27:41,301
million years.
We start to understand what it means to 

1710
01:27:41,301 --> 01:27:44,381
be the hero.
We start to tell stories about that and 

1711
01:27:44,381 --> 01:27:46,991
so then not only are we genetically 
aiming at that with the dominance 

1712
01:27:46,991 --> 01:27:49,760
hierarchy is a selection mechanism 
mediated by female choice,

1713
01:27:50,030 --> 01:27:52,430
but our stories are trying to push us in
that direction.

1714
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:54,170
And so then we say,
well look,

1715
01:27:54,171 --> 01:27:59,171
that person's admirable tell story about
him and we say this person is admirable 

1716
01:27:59,171 --> 01:28:03,570
of cal story about him and this person 
is admirable and at the same time we 

1717
01:28:03,570 --> 01:28:07,541
talk about the people who aren't 
admirable and then we start having 

1718
01:28:07,541 --> 01:28:08,510
admirable and non admirable as 
categories.

1719
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:13,960
And out of that you get something like 
good and evil and then you can start to 

1720
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:16,070
imagine the perfect person.
That would be not only.

1721
01:28:16,071 --> 01:28:18,680
So it would be you take 10 admirable 
people in.

1722
01:28:18,681 --> 01:28:22,460
You pull out someone who's met admirable
and that's a hero.

1723
01:28:22,730 --> 01:28:26,060
That becomes a religious figure across 
time that becomes a savior,

1724
01:28:26,061 --> 01:28:31,061
a messiah across time,
as we conceptualize what the ideal 

1725
01:28:31,061 --> 01:28:33,980
person is and we didn't in the West.
Here's how we figured it out.

1726
01:28:34,010 --> 01:28:39,010
We said the ideal person,
the ideal man is the person who tells 

1727
01:28:39,010 --> 01:28:39,680
the truth.
And what that means is that the best way

1728
01:28:39,681 --> 01:28:44,681
of climbing up any possible dominance 
hierarchy in a way that's most stable 

1729
01:28:44,681 --> 01:28:45,520
and most lasting.
That's,

1730
01:28:45,530 --> 01:28:47,420
that's the conclusion of western 
culture.

1731
01:28:47,421 --> 01:28:47,470
Sure.

1732
01:28:47,860 --> 01:28:49,300
So in a sense,
psychologically,

1733
01:28:49,301 --> 01:28:54,301
when you talk about postmodernists and 
their rejection of these classic male 

1734
01:28:54,301 --> 01:28:58,081
structures are,
what they're doing is realizing that 

1735
01:28:58,081 --> 01:29:00,760
they're not going to compete in the 
classic as stated male hierarchy.

1736
01:29:00,761 --> 01:29:02,190
So they're their own

1737
01:29:02,190 --> 01:29:03,770
version of it.
Sure.

1738
01:29:03,810 --> 01:29:05,280
That's the creative element.
Sure.

1739
01:29:05,281 --> 01:29:05,850
While we,
we,

1740
01:29:05,900 --> 01:29:07,230
he,
we asked earlier,

1741
01:29:07,231 --> 01:29:10,490
what's the motivation of these 
pathological guys who are out there like

1742
01:29:10,530 --> 01:29:12,990
bolstering up the feminists?
Yeah.

1743
01:29:12,991 --> 01:29:14,300
Well,
you know,

1744
01:29:14,550 --> 01:29:16,860
they don't compete any other way.
They don't compete.

1745
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:19,500
They figured out how to compete.
They compete as allies.

1746
01:29:19,501 --> 01:29:24,230
Let's say [inaudible] very sneaky.
Yeah.

1747
01:29:24,300 --> 01:29:25,820
Wow.
Yeah,

1748
01:29:26,180 --> 01:29:28,950
and that's how everybody always 
describes them to when you.

1749
01:29:28,951 --> 01:29:29,920
I mean,
it's almost like a,

1750
01:29:30,120 --> 01:29:32,540
we,
I avoid doing it because I just,

1751
01:29:32,550 --> 01:29:35,160
it just almost feels gross to label them
like that,

1752
01:29:35,161 --> 01:29:40,161
but that's,
that is the way you think of male 

1753
01:29:40,161 --> 01:29:40,161
feminists.
You think of them as sneaky.

1754
01:29:40,430 --> 01:29:42,230
Yeah.
And you know,

1755
01:29:42,450 --> 01:29:47,450
it's creepy and discriminated 
discriminatory towards classic male 

1756
01:29:47,450 --> 01:29:47,920
behaviors.
Yeah.

1757
01:29:47,921 --> 01:29:52,921
Well,
no wonder they haven't got a hope of 

1758
01:29:52,921 --> 01:29:53,520
competing in that hierarchy.
Wow,

1759
01:29:54,180 --> 01:29:56,010
that's deep.
That is deep.

1760
01:29:56,730 --> 01:30:00,210
This is going to be hurtful to a lot of 
people.

1761
01:30:00,360 --> 01:30:01,830
So a lot of people listening to this 
right now,

1762
01:30:01,831 --> 01:30:04,680
very upset you.
You asked earlier why,

1763
01:30:04,710 --> 01:30:07,530
why the postmodernists don't like blunt 
speech.

1764
01:30:08,210 --> 01:30:10,370
That's why man,
you know,

1765
01:30:10,380 --> 01:30:12,720
it's like the truth is something that 
Burns,

1766
01:30:12,810 --> 01:30:17,810
it burns off deadwood and people don't 
like having their dead wood burn it off 

1767
01:30:17,810 --> 01:30:20,190
often because they're like 95 percent 
deadwood and,

1768
01:30:20,230 --> 01:30:21,870
and I'm not being.
Believe me,

1769
01:30:21,871 --> 01:30:24,990
I'm not being snide about that.
It's no joke.

1770
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:30,440
When you start to realize how much of 
what you've constructed of yourself is 

1771
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:34,190
based on deception and lies,
that is a horrifying realization and it 

1772
01:30:34,190 --> 01:30:36,870
can easily be 95 percent of you have 
your things.

1773
01:30:36,871 --> 01:30:38,370
You say things,
you act out,

1774
01:30:39,060 --> 01:30:42,120
you know it's well.
You see that in Pinocchio,

1775
01:30:42,180 --> 01:30:44,790
which I often you discuss,
you know Pinocchio,

1776
01:30:44,791 --> 01:30:46,080
when he gets corrupt,
as he,

1777
01:30:46,081 --> 01:30:51,081
as he matures,
he first learns to lie and then he 

1778
01:30:51,081 --> 01:30:52,170
becomes a brain jackass on pleasure 
island.

1779
01:30:52,460 --> 01:30:57,460
It's like,
and he's threatened by the underground 

1780
01:30:57,460 --> 01:30:57,460
authoritarians,
right?

1781
01:30:57,460 --> 01:30:57,460
They're going to sell them to the salt 
mines.

1782
01:30:57,460 --> 01:30:58,140
It's like,
yeah,

1783
01:30:58,710 --> 01:31:00,840
that's for sure.
It's exactly right man.

1784
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:06,800
So then you figure out your uh,
brain jackass and you're lying all the 

1785
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:06,800
time.
That's a terrible realization.

1786
01:31:07,230 --> 01:31:10,890
And then all that needs to be burned 
away and no people don't like that.

1787
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:16,440
You know?
Now you've been embattled in this 

1788
01:31:16,440 --> 01:31:19,131
conflict for quite a long time and I've 
got to imagine that the way you look at 

1789
01:31:19,801 --> 01:31:21,450
the world,
the way you see things,

1790
01:31:21,451 --> 01:31:22,620
many,
many steps ahead.

1791
01:31:23,220 --> 01:31:28,220
Do you see any sort of a logical 
conclusion to this process?

1792
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:33,800
Do you see any light at the end of the 
tunnel or do you see an impossible to 

1793
01:31:35,881 --> 01:31:38,080
avoid conflict?
Like do what?

1794
01:31:38,120 --> 01:31:40,860
What do you see when you look at this 
whole thing?

1795
01:31:40,861 --> 01:31:45,861
Long term.
While I would say I can't look at it 

1796
01:31:45,861 --> 01:31:46,410
longterm,
and the reason for that is that,

1797
01:31:46,820 --> 01:31:51,060
and this is why I get a kick out of all 
the KEC Keka Stan Boys,

1798
01:31:51,660 --> 01:31:56,660
you know,
I do believe that we're in a period of 

1799
01:31:56,660 --> 01:31:56,660
chaos.

1800
01:31:56,660 --> 01:31:56,660
What's a Keck is tech.
Oh,

1801
01:31:56,660 --> 01:32:00,470
keck is a mythological country that's 
ruled by chaos by the Keck who's a frog 

1802
01:32:00,970 --> 01:32:01,990
frog.
As it turns out.

1803
01:32:03,110 --> 01:32:06,580
So I don't know about this.
You need to look them up.

1804
01:32:06,610 --> 01:32:08,790
That's a big internet thing.
Pakistan,

1805
01:32:09,160 --> 01:32:10,990
yeah.
Big Internet thing.

1806
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:12,760
All know,
but the frog and the frog,

1807
01:32:12,761 --> 01:32:17,761
the trump frog.
Pepe the frog who has apparently so 

1808
01:32:17,761 --> 01:32:22,021
distraught that his frog has been used 
to align them off and killed them off.

1809
01:32:22,301 --> 01:32:22,960
What?
Good luck.

1810
01:32:22,961 --> 01:32:23,980
He didn't.
All right,

1811
01:32:23,981 --> 01:32:26,250
so that's stupid because that's not who 
were,

1812
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:31,450
who were using pepe.
I haven't got the story quite right,

1813
01:32:31,451 --> 01:32:36,451
but I'll get it mostly right.
The people who were using Pepsi as a 

1814
01:32:36,451 --> 01:32:36,940
meme,
art is used.

1815
01:32:36,941 --> 01:32:38,840
Yeah,
that public of Keka Stan,

1816
01:32:40,050 --> 01:32:44,650
so they use this symbol,
k e Dot k to replace lol,

1817
01:32:44,830 --> 01:32:49,150
and the reason they did that was because
k e k in Korean means lol,

1818
01:32:49,180 --> 01:32:50,680
and so it was just this little joke.

1819
01:32:51,190 --> 01:32:52,210
Keck K,
e,

1820
01:32:52,230 --> 01:32:57,230
k.
well then somebody found out these were 

1821
01:32:57,230 --> 01:32:57,230
people who were using pepe.
Remember it's a frog.

1822
01:32:57,280 --> 01:33:02,280
Then people found out that Keck was an 
Egyptian God and he was a frog and he 

1823
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:05,650
was between categories,
sort of like a transsexual by the way.

1824
01:33:05,800 --> 01:33:10,750
He was between categories and so now 
they have this republic of Keck and it's

1825
01:33:10,751 --> 01:33:13,360
ruled by this Egyptian God whose name is
cat,

1826
01:33:13,390 --> 01:33:14,500
who's a frog.
Hold on,

1827
01:33:14,530 --> 01:33:15,480
go back,
go back,

1828
01:33:15,481 --> 01:33:16,690
go.
Don't keep changing this.

1829
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:19,000
Jamie's doing this in the background 
while you're talking,

1830
01:33:19,001 --> 01:33:23,020
but look at this.
There's a frog with a make America great

1831
01:33:23,021 --> 01:33:28,021
again hat and he's got like a tombstone.
It says those who served in the meme 

1832
01:33:29,330 --> 01:33:33,310
2015 and 2016.
We are the gods of the great meme war.

1833
01:33:33,311 --> 01:33:36,520
We are the shit posters.
The Legion of Keck,

1834
01:33:36,550 --> 01:33:39,940
we are the internet,
the death of the normies,

1835
01:33:40,450 --> 01:33:45,450
lapels and CAC.
We are one way or the fuck is going on 

1836
01:33:45,450 --> 01:33:45,730
that.
That is the question.

1837
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:48,640
That's the question you asked me and my 
answer was,

1838
01:33:48,641 --> 01:33:51,580
I don't know.
We're in a period of chaos.

1839
01:33:52,180 --> 01:33:54,480
We in a period of chaos and in a period 
of chaos,

1840
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:58,190
the time horizon shrinks because no,
because the outcome is uncertain whether

1841
01:33:58,191 --> 01:33:59,920
this seems to be truly

1842
01:34:00,010 --> 01:34:02,350
embracing chaos.
I mean just that statement.

1843
01:34:02,351 --> 01:34:05,680
The frog that Donald Trump thing with 
the hat on.

1844
01:34:05,980 --> 01:34:08,410
This is.
This is one of the things it seems to me

1845
01:34:08,411 --> 01:34:13,411
to be a reoccurring feature in this 
whole chaos ballet that we're watching 

1846
01:34:14,291 --> 01:34:19,291
play out,
is that people are enjoying the fact 

1847
01:34:19,291 --> 01:34:22,150
that Donald Trump sucks as a president.
They don't feel threatened by it.

1848
01:34:22,180 --> 01:34:27,180
They like it and they don't like it 
because they want to burn this mother 

1849
01:34:27,180 --> 01:34:29,020
fucker to the ground and torch this 
thing and like a phoenix.

1850
01:34:29,021 --> 01:34:30,860
We'll arrives from the fire.
No,

1851
01:34:30,940 --> 01:34:31,870
no,
it's not that.

1852
01:34:32,110 --> 01:34:34,720
It's that they.
They are enjoying that.

1853
01:34:34,721 --> 01:34:37,780
It's falling apart.
This is why we are the shit posters.

1854
01:34:37,930 --> 01:34:39,480
Do you know what shit posting is?
Yep.

1855
01:34:39,790 --> 01:34:40,470
Jamie explained.

1856
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:45,960
You're really good at explaining it.
You're posting for like literally no 

1857
01:34:46,191 --> 01:34:48,530
reason other than to get someone mad.
It's almost like trolling,

1858
01:34:48,531 --> 01:34:50,570
but it's like a separate level of 
trolling.

1859
01:34:50,840 --> 01:34:52,010
Right?
That's a good way to say it.

1860
01:34:52,070 --> 01:34:53,720
Yeah.
That's a good way of provocation for its

1861
01:34:53,721 --> 01:34:58,721
own sake.
Jamie's the first person to tell me 

1862
01:34:58,721 --> 01:34:58,721
about posting.
I wasn't

1863
01:34:58,721 --> 01:35:00,590
aware until about what a year ago.
Yeah,

1864
01:35:00,680 --> 01:35:01,810
I think it was.
Yeah,

1865
01:35:02,670 --> 01:35:03,980
preelection time.
I did not know.

1866
01:35:04,430 --> 01:35:06,950
So I mean there's rules for operating in
chaos,

1867
01:35:07,630 --> 01:35:12,630
right?
Because that's when you're in the belly 

1868
01:35:12,630 --> 01:35:12,630
of the beast or the belly of the whale 
and you're underwater,

1869
01:35:12,630 --> 01:35:16,540
you're in the underworld,
you're in the underworld and chaos and 

1870
01:35:16,540 --> 01:35:16,540
so that's a really cool thing to know 
Joe.

1871
01:35:16,540 --> 01:35:20,820
So imagine that the normal world of 
mankind is inside that dominance 

1872
01:35:20,820 --> 01:35:25,811
hierarchy where everything is going well
because nothing abnormal is happening 

1873
01:35:25,811 --> 01:35:29,351
and you're getting what you need and you
want and you're conscious knowledge 

1874
01:35:29,351 --> 01:35:29,351
suffices,
right?

1875
01:35:29,480 --> 01:35:34,480
Okay.
But then something tilts in that 

1876
01:35:34,480 --> 01:35:34,480
structure no longer works.
So where do you end up?

1877
01:35:34,480 --> 01:35:37,130
You end up in underworld.
That's what happens when your partner of

1878
01:35:37,131 --> 01:35:42,131
20 years has a,
has a long term affair and you find out 

1879
01:35:42,131 --> 01:35:43,640
about it.
It's like you thought you knew where you

1880
01:35:43,641 --> 01:35:48,641
were but you didn't,
and now that you found out you don't 

1881
01:35:48,641 --> 01:35:51,110
know where you are when you don't know 
where you are,

1882
01:35:51,230 --> 01:35:52,550
you're in the underworld.

1883
01:35:52,600 --> 01:35:53,450
Woo.
Right,

1884
01:35:53,451 --> 01:35:55,640
and that's where the unconscious forces 
play.

1885
01:35:55,790 --> 01:36:00,790
Those are the gods.
That's why there's gods in the 

1886
01:36:00,790 --> 01:36:02,831
underworld,
and people go to the underworld all the 

1887
01:36:02,831 --> 01:36:03,170
time.
It's chaos and fear and depression,

1888
01:36:03,290 --> 01:36:05,090
hopelessness and imaginative.
This,

1889
01:36:05,240 --> 01:36:08,000
it's everything.
It's KLM is terrifying to people.

1890
01:36:08,300 --> 01:36:11,900
Terrifying and promising,
terrifying and promising because dragons

1891
01:36:11,901 --> 01:36:15,980
have gold because it's always the 
unknown has two things.

1892
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,540
Just like the future.
It's like lookout.

1893
01:36:19,580 --> 01:36:23,090
It'll do you in and look out.
It offers everything to you.

1894
01:36:23,300 --> 01:36:26,240
That's the underworld.
That's why the hero always goes into the

1895
01:36:26,241 --> 01:36:31,241
underworld to find a cave full of gold 
that's guarded by a dragon in the 

1896
01:36:31,241 --> 01:36:33,440
hobbit.
Literally Peel will fly.

1897
01:36:34,110 --> 01:36:39,110
That's the oldest story of mankind.
It's really the our oldest story and so 

1898
01:36:39,110 --> 01:36:44,080
that the underworld is chaos.
It's chaos and down there there's all 

1899
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:48,281
sorts of play of possibility and the 
reason the frog with a was the guardian 

1900
01:36:48,281 --> 01:36:52,481
of chaos is because of the frog is this 
thing that doesn't fit into categories 

1901
01:36:52,481 --> 01:36:53,180
you see,
because it's partly water.

1902
01:36:53,210 --> 01:36:55,400
It's partly land.
It's tadpole,

1903
01:36:55,401 --> 01:36:56,600
yet it's,
it's adult,

1904
01:36:56,660 --> 01:37:01,660
right?
So it's like a fish and then it's like 

1905
01:37:01,660 --> 01:37:03,131
an animal doesn't fit and it's things 
that don't fit that blow apart the 

1906
01:37:03,131 --> 01:37:04,130
categories,
right?

1907
01:37:04,131 --> 01:37:09,131
Well,
that's what the transsexuals due to the 

1908
01:37:09,131 --> 01:37:10,601
category of gender for example,
and that puts you in this state of 

1909
01:37:10,601 --> 01:37:14,081
chaos.
It puts you in this state of chaos and 

1910
01:37:14,081 --> 01:37:17,441
that's what we're in now.
We're in a state of chaos and so what 

1911
01:37:17,441 --> 01:37:17,441
are the rules for operating in a state 
of chaos?

1912
01:37:17,500 --> 01:37:22,500
While as far as I can tell,
the fundamental rule when operating in 

1913
01:37:22,500 --> 01:37:23,990
chaos is tell the truth.
So for example,

1914
01:37:23,991 --> 01:37:28,991
if you will,
for the people that want to navigate 

1915
01:37:28,991 --> 01:37:28,991
this successful.
Yep.

1916
01:37:28,991 --> 01:37:29,870
All you've got,
that's what you've got as a,

1917
01:37:30,100 --> 01:37:33,350
as a shield and a weapon and,
and,

1918
01:37:35,130 --> 01:37:36,350
and that,
that's the guideposts.

1919
01:37:36,430 --> 01:37:37,670
That's the,
that's the way through.

1920
01:37:37,670 --> 01:37:39,590
When you see that hero stories all the 
time,

1921
01:37:39,591 --> 01:37:43,670
you know,
so it's its allegiance to the truth,

1922
01:37:43,671 --> 01:37:46,130
but the truth is a strange thing.
It's a very strange thing.

1923
01:37:46,131 --> 01:37:51,131
Often the hero in a,
in a story has to assimilate their dark 

1924
01:37:51,131 --> 01:37:52,940
side before they're capable of telling 
the truth.

1925
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:54,080
Right?
In the Hobbit,

1926
01:37:54,081 --> 01:37:55,860
for example,
he has to become a thief,

1927
01:37:57,270 --> 01:37:59,130
right?
Because he has to get tough.

1928
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:00,870
That's the thing.
That's the thing.

1929
01:38:00,871 --> 01:38:05,871
Also,
the thing about telling the truth is 

1930
01:38:05,871 --> 01:38:05,871
that it's not for.
It's not for the naive,

1931
01:38:05,970 --> 01:38:10,970
not at all,
and partly because it burns off 

1932
01:38:10,970 --> 01:38:14,500
deadwood.
It's partly because it hurts people's 

1933
01:38:14,500 --> 01:38:14,500
feelings.
It's a sword.

1934
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:18,720
So you have to be a warrior.
Wow.

1935
01:38:18,990 --> 01:38:20,280
A truth warrior

1936
01:38:22,180 --> 01:38:24,100
in this time of chaos,
right?

1937
01:38:24,520 --> 01:38:26,290
What emerges from this,
right?

1938
01:38:27,620 --> 01:38:31,820
Sometimes sometimes it's catastrophe.
That's the thing about these categories,

1939
01:38:31,821 --> 01:38:33,830
they're real,
they're real.

1940
01:38:34,370 --> 01:38:37,070
And you know,
the optimists that I hear say,

1941
01:38:37,071 --> 01:38:42,071
well,
depending on the swings and then it 

1942
01:38:42,071 --> 01:38:42,071
swings back and I think yeah,
well sometimes it,

1943
01:38:42,071 --> 01:38:46,900
it takes 100 years to swing back and it 
takes a hell of a lot of people out on 

1944
01:38:46,900 --> 01:38:47,720
the way and sometimes it never swings 
back at all.

1945
01:38:48,230 --> 01:38:53,230
So you know,
sometimes people go out to fight a 

1946
01:38:53,230 --> 01:38:55,040
dragon and it just eats them or it burns
them and that's the end of that.

1947
01:38:55,820 --> 01:39:00,820
And like we're in an unstable period of 
time at the moment in a transition 

1948
01:39:00,820 --> 01:39:02,600
period of some sort.
I can't put my finger on it,

1949
01:39:02,601 --> 01:39:07,601
but I know that that's partly why what 
I've been saying has been resonating 

1950
01:39:07,601 --> 01:39:10,400
with people because obviously it's not 
about pronouns.

1951
01:39:10,550 --> 01:39:12,710
Well it is.
It is.

1952
01:39:12,711 --> 01:39:13,100
Except

1953
01:39:15,060 --> 01:39:18,240
language turns out to be about a lot 
more than like,

1954
01:39:18,241 --> 01:39:23,241
you can't take a little thing like the 
desire to transform pronouns and think 

1955
01:39:23,241 --> 01:39:24,750
that that's a little thing.
It's not a little thing.

1956
01:39:24,751 --> 01:39:29,751
It's also your disagreement with this 
use of these new gender pronoun words 

1957
01:39:30,781 --> 01:39:35,781
they're trying to force on.
People has opened up this discussion 

1958
01:39:35,781 --> 01:39:40,070
where you can enlightened people on your
very deep understanding of human 

1959
01:39:40,531 --> 01:39:45,531
psychology.
It's not just simply this gender 

1960
01:39:45,531 --> 01:39:45,750
pronoun,
disagreement.

1961
01:39:45,930 --> 01:39:48,120
You're transphobic,
you're a racist,

1962
01:39:48,121 --> 01:39:53,121
you're a trans phobic piece of shit.
It's this opportunity now because of 

1963
01:39:53,121 --> 01:39:57,951
this.
That mean essentially they fucked with 

1964
01:39:57,951 --> 01:40:00,861
the wrong dude really to say it the 
right way because your.

1965
01:40:01,971 --> 01:40:03,600
Your understanding of this,
this tee shirt,

1966
01:40:04,070 --> 01:40:06,660
it's not shallow in any sense of the 
word.

1967
01:40:06,661 --> 01:40:11,661
I mean to engage you in this,
this battle of rhetoric is it allows you

1968
01:40:15,210 --> 01:40:20,210
to expose your very deep understanding 
what the problems that are going on 

1969
01:40:20,210 --> 01:40:21,160
right now with human beings in general.
Well,

1970
01:40:21,161 --> 01:40:26,161
it looks,
it looks like that to me because what 

1971
01:40:26,161 --> 01:40:26,161
happens

1972
01:40:26,161 --> 01:40:28,820
as far as I can tell with my youtube 
channel say is that people are often 

1973
01:40:28,820 --> 01:40:31,020
pulled in because of the social justice 
warrior stuff,

1974
01:40:31,350 --> 01:40:36,350
but then they see I have all these other
videos and they're curious about me 

1975
01:40:36,350 --> 01:40:39,320
partly because people are calling me 
names and so then they watch a video or 

1976
01:40:39,320 --> 01:40:39,650
two and they think,
hmm,

1977
01:40:40,530 --> 01:40:42,620
I haven't heard that before.
You know,

1978
01:40:42,630 --> 01:40:45,180
and then they watch a bunch of them and 
then they write me and say,

1979
01:40:45,181 --> 01:40:46,530
man,
that was really helpful.

1980
01:40:47,160 --> 01:40:52,160
And I say thanks.
I'm really happy about that because I 

1981
01:40:52,160 --> 01:40:52,160
am.

1982
01:40:52,160 --> 01:40:52,260
Are you in an unmanageable position now 
though?

1983
01:40:52,261 --> 01:40:53,980
As far as responding to people

1984
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:57,220
because like I try to respond to people 
but I can't.

1985
01:40:58,180 --> 01:41:01,870
It's not possible.
I would imagine over the last few months

1986
01:41:01,871 --> 01:41:04,150
it must be just overwhelming.
Yeah,

1987
01:41:04,151 --> 01:41:04,690
the.
Yeah.

1988
01:41:04,691 --> 01:41:07,710
Well I've given up trying to keep up on 
my email.

1989
01:41:07,720 --> 01:41:12,720
It's just not.
My wife helps me with that and I've had 

1990
01:41:12,720 --> 01:41:12,720
some other people helped me but you 
know,

1991
01:41:12,720 --> 01:41:16,351
what I do is I look and I try to say 
thank you to people and write them a 

1992
01:41:16,351 --> 01:41:18,570
couple of lines when I have a moment,
but you know,

1993
01:41:18,640 --> 01:41:23,640
because I can't get to all of it.
They just come in by the position and 

1994
01:41:24,550 --> 01:41:27,940
it's too bad because people are writing 
me very heartfelt long letters.

1995
01:41:27,990 --> 01:41:32,990
They're often brilliant.
Frequently like amazing letters telling 

1996
01:41:32,990 --> 01:41:33,300
me,
you know,

1997
01:41:33,310 --> 01:41:37,090
their experiences with the authoritarian
left or or,

1998
01:41:37,210 --> 01:41:42,210
or the way they've been cornered in one 
way or another or or how starting to 

1999
01:41:42,611 --> 01:41:44,290
clean up the room changed their life.

2000
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:49,320
That's quite fun because it's something 
I always tell people to do instead of 

2001
01:41:49,320 --> 01:41:50,890
going out and protesting Jesus.
I just can't stand up the room.

2002
01:41:51,490 --> 01:41:53,140
Yeah.
Meaning,

2003
01:41:53,380 --> 01:41:58,380
well,
my sense is is that if you want to 

2004
01:41:58,380 --> 01:41:58,380
change the world,
you start from yourself and work outward

2005
01:41:58,380 --> 01:41:59,770
because you build your competence that 
way.

2006
01:42:00,040 --> 01:42:05,040
It's like,
I don't know how you can go out and 

2007
01:42:05,040 --> 01:42:06,691
protest the structure of the entire 
economic system if can't keep your room 

2008
01:42:06,691 --> 01:42:06,691
organized.
Yeah.

2009
01:42:06,691 --> 01:42:10,090
It's not an issue with people though,
that they always want to enact some sort

2010
01:42:10,091 --> 01:42:14,560
of control over the outside world when 
they're inside is all fucked up.

2011
01:42:15,140 --> 01:42:16,810
People that are the most adamant about 
it.

2012
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:18,700
Well,
I think there's some truth in that.

2013
01:42:20,140 --> 01:42:21,670
I think there is truth in that.
I mean,

2014
01:42:21,671 --> 01:42:24,730
people try to change the outside world 
for lots of ways,

2015
01:42:24,731 --> 01:42:27,520
but many of those ways aren't just pure 
good.

2016
01:42:27,880 --> 01:42:29,350
But you know,
I thought about,

2017
01:42:29,710 --> 01:42:34,710
well,
I made a video call which was called 

2018
01:42:34,710 --> 01:42:36,511
message to millennials where I was,
it was called how to change the world 

2019
01:42:36,511 --> 01:42:40,111
properly,
a bit of a on the potential site I 

2020
01:42:40,111 --> 01:42:42,931
suppose,
but I was trying to produce something 

2021
01:42:42,931 --> 01:42:45,721
that was a counter position to this idea
that what you should do is go out and 

2022
01:42:45,721 --> 01:42:46,570
fix up other people.
You know,

2023
01:42:46,630 --> 01:42:49,960
that's just not right.
There's a new testament line about that.

2024
01:42:49,961 --> 01:42:51,310
Something about,
you know,

2025
01:42:51,311 --> 01:42:56,311
not worrying too much about the log in 
your neighbor's eye or about the speck 

2026
01:42:56,311 --> 01:42:57,760
in your neighbor's eye.
When you have a log in your eye.

2027
01:42:58,010 --> 01:42:58,870
It's like,
yes,

2028
01:42:59,110 --> 01:43:00,100
no kidding,
but you know,

2029
01:43:00,101 --> 01:43:02,560
do you really want to,
do you really want to face that?

2030
01:43:02,910 --> 01:43:04,770
So what I've thought about is that,
well,

2031
01:43:04,780 --> 01:43:09,280
what you start to do is you start to 
tell and act out the truth locally,

2032
01:43:09,850 --> 01:43:12,460
like within the domain of your actual 
competence.

2033
01:43:12,460 --> 01:43:17,460
You know,
because the world presents itself as a 

2034
01:43:17,460 --> 01:43:20,041
series of puzzles,
some of which you're capable of solving 

2035
01:43:20,041 --> 01:43:23,431
and some of which you're not.
And you have many puzzles in front of 

2036
01:43:23,431 --> 01:43:24,730
you that you could solve,
but you choose not to.

2037
01:43:25,290 --> 01:43:27,970
You know that those are the things that 
weigh on your conscience.

2038
01:43:28,180 --> 01:43:28,740
It's like,
you know,

2039
01:43:28,760 --> 01:43:30,310
I should really do this,
but you don't.

2040
01:43:30,630 --> 01:43:35,630
It's like,
so I had this idea a long time ago 

2041
01:43:35,630 --> 01:43:35,630
because the world is a pretty dreadful 
place.

2042
01:43:35,630 --> 01:43:35,630
I thought,
well,

2043
01:43:35,630 --> 01:43:40,620
what would the world be like if people 
stopped avoiding the things they knew 

2044
01:43:40,620 --> 01:43:41,220
they should do?
You know?

2045
01:43:41,260 --> 01:43:46,260
Because the question is how much are we 
contributing to the fact that life is a 

2046
01:43:46,600 --> 01:43:48,940
as an existential catastrophe and a 
tragedy?

2047
01:43:48,941 --> 01:43:51,980
How much is our own corruption 
contributing to that?

2048
01:43:52,180 --> 01:43:57,180
How it's a really worthwhile question.
Things you leave undone because you're 

2049
01:43:57,180 --> 01:43:57,710
angry,
you're resentful,

2050
01:43:57,711 --> 01:43:59,060
you're lazy,
you have inertia.

2051
01:43:59,720 --> 01:44:01,940
Well,
you consult your conscience and it says,

2052
01:44:01,941 --> 01:44:02,480
well,
you know,

2053
01:44:03,020 --> 01:44:04,820
that place over there could use a little
work.

2054
01:44:05,930 --> 01:44:09,530
It's the same as working on yourself and
so you clean that up because you can.

2055
01:44:10,080 --> 01:44:15,080
Then things are a little clearer around 
you and you're a little better off 

2056
01:44:15,080 --> 01:44:19,090
because you've practiced a bit and and 
so your little stronger and then 

2057
01:44:19,090 --> 01:44:19,310
something else manifests itself and 
says,

2058
01:44:19,311 --> 01:44:24,311
well,
maybe you could like take a crack at 

2059
01:44:24,311 --> 01:44:26,201
fixing me up to,
so you decided to do that and then that 

2060
01:44:26,201 --> 01:44:29,051
gets a little bit more pristine and soon
and it's humble because you're not 

2061
01:44:29,421 --> 01:44:32,600
exceeding your domain of competence.
You know?

2062
01:44:32,630 --> 01:44:34,820
It's like,
don't be fixing up the economy.

2063
01:44:34,850 --> 01:44:39,850
Eighteen year old,
you don't know anything about the 

2064
01:44:39,850 --> 01:44:42,851
economy.
It's a massive complex machine beyond 

2065
01:44:42,851 --> 01:44:44,330
anyone's understanding and you mess with
it at your peril.

2066
01:44:45,140 --> 01:44:47,180
So when can you even clean up your own 
room?

2067
01:44:47,330 --> 01:44:49,010
No.
Well,

2068
01:44:49,550 --> 01:44:54,550
you should think about that.
You should think about that because if 

2069
01:44:54,550 --> 01:44:58,871
you can't even clean up your own room,
who the hell are you to give advice to 

2070
01:44:58,871 --> 01:44:58,871
the world?

2071
01:45:00,210 --> 01:45:05,210
Very,
very important thing for people to hear 

2072
01:45:05,210 --> 01:45:07,250
is a very important thing for people to 
hear it so many times.

2073
01:45:07,610 --> 01:45:12,610
I mean,
here's a perfect example that people 

2074
01:45:12,610 --> 01:45:13,880
understand and be able to resonate with.
It'll resonate with them rather when you

2075
01:45:13,881 --> 01:45:18,881
see people that have a lot of 
inspirational memes on instagram and 

2076
01:45:19,941 --> 01:45:24,941
facebook through almost all fucked up.
L Ron Hubbard was completely insane and 

2077
01:45:26,901 --> 01:45:31,310
was self-diagnosing and one of the 
things he was trying to do,

2078
01:45:31,400 --> 01:45:33,950
I mean if you read Lawrence Wright's 
book going clear,

2079
01:45:34,310 --> 01:45:39,310
he was clearly trying to fix himself in 
creating this religion,

2080
01:45:40,520 --> 01:45:45,520
this religion that was a lot of it based
on self help principals that he took 

2081
01:45:45,520 --> 01:45:49,451
from other sources that you see from a 
lot of these people that are like,

2082
01:45:49,920 --> 01:45:54,920
you didn't mean just this real 
legitimately motivational people that 

2083
01:45:54,920 --> 01:45:59,320
find great benefit in being an example 
of powerful,

2084
01:45:59,451 --> 01:46:04,451
strong example and they find great 
comfort in showing people the methods 

2085
01:46:05,270 --> 01:46:08,570
that they've used in order to improve 
their life.

2086
01:46:08,750 --> 01:46:12,260
Like your own self auditing system that 
you're promoting.

2087
01:46:12,670 --> 01:46:13,610
Yeah.
So it's not just,

2088
01:46:13,611 --> 01:46:16,520
it's not that they're all that.
It's all a,

2089
01:46:16,610 --> 01:46:20,150
it's all a not real or you know.

2090
01:46:20,260 --> 01:46:25,260
No,
there's not like there's no way that 

2091
01:46:25,260 --> 01:46:25,260
people can improve them.
Quite the contrary.

2092
01:46:25,260 --> 01:46:30,040
They people can improve themselves I 
think to a degree that we don't 

2093
01:46:30,040 --> 01:46:30,040
understand.
You know,

2094
01:46:30,040 --> 01:46:32,110
because a human being for better or 
worse,

2095
01:46:32,111 --> 01:46:36,670
this is something potential as well as 
something actual that's really weird,

2096
01:46:36,850 --> 01:46:40,090
that idea of potential because it's not 
actually measurable,

2097
01:46:40,091 --> 01:46:45,091
are tangible,
but we seriously believe it's something 

2098
01:46:45,091 --> 01:46:45,150
like the idea of spirit,
you know,

2099
01:46:45,310 --> 01:46:46,270
by potential.
Yeah,

2100
01:46:46,271 --> 01:46:47,800
but people believe in it.
You see,

2101
01:46:48,460 --> 01:46:49,380
because I might say,
well,

2102
01:46:49,381 --> 01:46:52,350
you're not living up to your potential 
and you might disagree,

2103
01:46:52,351 --> 01:46:55,740
but you would definitely understand the 
statement and you think,

2104
01:46:55,741 --> 01:46:57,030
well,
what is this potential?

2105
01:46:57,031 --> 01:46:59,160
It's like,
it's not actual.

2106
01:46:59,430 --> 01:47:00,450
It's not real,

2107
01:47:00,630 --> 01:47:01,950
but it is,
isn't it though?

2108
01:47:02,100 --> 01:47:05,460
If you see someone,
especially artistic,

2109
01:47:05,790 --> 01:47:10,790
like you see someone who may be self 
sabotage with drugs or alcohol or 

2110
01:47:10,790 --> 01:47:14,610
personal chaos,
but they can create amazing music,

2111
01:47:14,611 --> 01:47:17,520
but they never get it out.
You see that oftentimes with the artists

2112
01:47:17,880 --> 01:47:21,000
and oftentimes you see that after 
initial success,

2113
01:47:21,001 --> 01:47:25,410
you'll see some amazing motivation early
in their career.

2114
01:47:25,411 --> 01:47:28,980
Then initial success and then self 
sabotage after the fact,

2115
01:47:29,280 --> 01:47:34,280
not realizing their potential.
Obviously they've hit some sort of a 

2116
01:47:34,280 --> 01:47:36,210
frequency with a resonate with people 
that appreciate them.

2117
01:47:36,720 --> 01:47:38,850
Authors,
you see that with musicians,

2118
01:47:38,851 --> 01:47:39,850
comedians,
uh,

2119
01:47:39,851 --> 01:47:44,851
all sorts of people to create things and
then they're not living up to their 

2120
01:47:44,851 --> 01:47:49,011
potential because they've allowed the 
demons to take over the inner workings 

2121
01:47:49,011 --> 01:47:49,660
of their mind,
you know,

2122
01:47:49,680 --> 01:47:51,930
so and again,
I'm not talking.

2123
01:47:52,380 --> 01:47:55,950
There's a lot of sincere people that are
motivational people that I follow.

2124
01:47:55,951 --> 01:48:00,951
I think there's a lot of people out 
there that are then they take a great 

2125
01:48:00,951 --> 01:48:04,710
pleasure and expressing to other people 
the things that have benefited them.

2126
01:48:04,711 --> 01:48:06,180
So I don't,
I don't want to sell them short.

2127
01:48:06,260 --> 01:48:06,980
Well,
see,

2128
01:48:07,220 --> 01:48:10,660
this is part of the reason I liked the 
psychoanalysts say Freud Ngo,

2129
01:48:11,100 --> 01:48:16,100
because as an I would say particularly 
young because I haven't read anyone I 

2130
01:48:16,100 --> 01:48:18,050
regard as deeper than you.
He's terrifying,

2131
01:48:18,170 --> 01:48:19,600
truly terrifying.
But,

2132
01:48:19,690 --> 01:48:24,690
but here's one of the things that 
differentiates from the typical self 

2133
01:48:24,690 --> 01:48:28,061
help person I really love this,
is that he believes that the pathway to 

2134
01:48:28,520 --> 01:48:30,850
completion as a human being is through 
the,

2135
01:48:31,350 --> 01:48:36,350
is through the embodiment of the monster
embodiment of the monster.

2136
01:48:38,210 --> 01:48:43,160
That's the discovery of the shadow.
You see so young didn't believe that you

2137
01:48:43,161 --> 01:48:46,160
could be a good person until you 
realized your capacity for evil.

2138
01:48:46,220 --> 01:48:49,490
I don't mean acted it out in the world,
but understand that it's possible.

2139
01:48:49,491 --> 01:48:50,780
Well,
not only understand it,

2140
01:48:50,781 --> 01:48:54,080
but then to bring it under your control.
You see,

2141
01:48:54,081 --> 01:48:59,081
because there's a big difference between
someone who's naive and is a good 

2142
01:48:59,081 --> 01:48:59,081
person.

2143
01:48:59,510 --> 01:49:04,510
They're naive,
they're a good person because they can 

2144
01:49:04,510 --> 01:49:04,510
not be there like a domesticated house 
cat.

2145
01:49:05,160 --> 01:49:10,160
There's nothing.
They don't even have the capacity to be 

2146
01:49:10,160 --> 01:49:10,790
bad,
so there's no morality in that.

2147
01:49:11,600 --> 01:49:15,200
The morality comes when you're a monster
and you can control it,

2148
01:49:15,680 --> 01:49:17,690
and that's the union encounter with the 
shadow.

2149
01:49:17,700 --> 01:49:19,010
So young said,
for example,

2150
01:49:19,011 --> 01:49:21,350
that the roots of the shadow go all the 
way down to hell,

2151
01:49:21,710 --> 01:49:25,280
and what he meant by that is that you.
You can think about it literally.

2152
01:49:25,281 --> 01:49:30,281
You think about it metaphorically.
We'll just think about it 

2153
01:49:30,281 --> 01:49:31,460
metaphorically.
It's like if you start to understand who

2154
01:49:31,461 --> 01:49:36,461
you are,
then you understand the Nazis and who 

2155
01:49:36,461 --> 01:49:38,620
wants to understand the Nazis.
You know,

2156
01:49:38,870 --> 01:49:42,830
I can understand sex criminals,
I can understand them,

2157
01:49:43,600 --> 01:49:48,600
right?
I can understand Nazis and the reason 

2158
01:49:48,600 --> 01:49:51,460
for is because I can see that as an 
aspect of myself truly,

2159
01:49:52,540 --> 01:49:55,510
but one of the things that so inter and 
it's terrifying to realize that,

2160
01:49:55,600 --> 01:49:57,610
which is why it's terrifying to realize 
the shadow,

2161
01:49:57,730 --> 01:49:59,320
which is why people don't do it.

2162
01:49:59,860 --> 01:50:02,350
It's no wonder they don't do it.
You know,

2163
01:50:02,690 --> 01:50:07,690
it's a,
it's a horrible thing to realize that 

2164
01:50:07,690 --> 01:50:10,090
you're human and what being human means 
like Angel,

2165
01:50:10,470 --> 01:50:13,420
like Christ to Satan.
That's the human being.

2166
01:50:14,350 --> 01:50:15,640
And you might say,
well,

2167
01:50:15,850 --> 01:50:17,050
those aren't real.
It's like,

2168
01:50:17,051 --> 01:50:19,060
okay,
well they're figments of the imagination

2169
01:50:19,061 --> 01:50:21,580
that the human race constructed to 
describe themselves.

2170
01:50:21,760 --> 01:50:25,120
Find that.
Does that make it less frightening?

2171
01:50:25,210 --> 01:50:28,150
I don't think so.
So,

2172
01:50:28,151 --> 01:50:30,670
and it's not.
It doesn't make it any less frightening.

2173
01:50:30,671 --> 01:50:33,310
If you take those two extreme seriously 
and he might say,

2174
01:50:33,311 --> 01:50:35,290
well,
who's going to take the Christ extreme?

2175
01:50:35,291 --> 01:50:36,760
Seriously?
It's no problem,

2176
01:50:36,761 --> 01:50:40,150
man dispense with it.
He tried getting rid of the other side.

2177
01:50:40,450 --> 01:50:45,450
See how you do with that.
So yones idea that you find so 

2178
01:50:47,321 --> 01:50:47,980
compelling

2179
01:50:48,510 --> 01:50:53,510
was essentially that one has to 
understand their potential for horrific 

2180
01:50:54,241 --> 01:50:56,250
behavior.
That it almost exists in all of us,

2181
01:50:56,251 --> 01:50:59,770
that it's a facet of,
of just the human.

2182
01:51:00,700 --> 01:51:01,360
Well,
look,

2183
01:51:01,600 --> 01:51:05,650
I know partly why you're so popular.
It's because you're a monster.

2184
01:51:06,400 --> 01:51:06,880
I mean,
look,

2185
01:51:06,881 --> 01:51:09,520
I watched what you did to the 
Kardashians on your,

2186
01:51:09,521 --> 01:51:10,180
on your,
uh,

2187
01:51:10,260 --> 01:51:12,250
engender on your comedy show,
man.

2188
01:51:12,400 --> 01:51:15,010
You did this whole gargoyle thing.
Yeah.

2189
01:51:15,011 --> 01:51:16,240
You remember,
you laugh.

2190
01:51:16,270 --> 01:51:16,680
Yeah.
I see.

2191
01:51:16,681 --> 01:51:18,100
You can even laugh about that.
I mean,

2192
01:51:18,101 --> 01:51:23,101
it was horrifying to be.
You were coached up on the back of this 

2193
01:51:23,101 --> 01:51:23,101
chair.
It's horrifying to do.

2194
01:51:23,140 --> 01:51:24,910
Oh yeah.
I couldn't believe you did it.

2195
01:51:24,950 --> 01:51:25,510
Well,
the problem

2196
01:51:25,620 --> 01:51:28,310
doing it is this is going to sound 
fucked up,

2197
01:51:28,700 --> 01:51:33,700
but while I'm doing it,
I'm not thinking I'm doing a comedy 

2198
01:51:33,700 --> 01:51:35,090
sketch.
This is what's fucked up about it.

2199
01:51:35,360 --> 01:51:38,180
While I'm crouched there.
I'm thinking like a demon.

2200
01:51:39,020 --> 01:51:41,330
Like,
while that's the reason why I do it that

2201
01:51:41,331 --> 01:51:44,660
way.
The reason why do it in the like,

2202
01:51:45,050 --> 01:51:46,940
I'm a very flexible,
right?

2203
01:51:46,941 --> 01:51:51,941
So it's one of the reasons why I do it 
in almost because I want it to be in an 

2204
01:51:51,941 --> 01:51:54,530
almost a w,
w,

2205
01:51:54,540 --> 01:51:58,490
W in a way that you don't imagine human 
beings moving,

2206
01:51:58,880 --> 01:51:59,770
you know,
that you,

2207
01:51:59,810 --> 01:52:04,810
it's like it,
it confuses the mind because it's not 

2208
01:52:04,810 --> 01:52:06,560
standard human movement.
And then on top of that,

2209
01:52:06,590 --> 01:52:09,470
the way I'm thinking and then just like 
explosive.

2210
01:52:09,471 --> 01:52:13,220
Like when he yells out nonsense,
and I say he because I don't think of it

2211
01:52:13,221 --> 01:52:14,870
as me,
I really think it's,

2212
01:52:15,030 --> 01:52:18,260
it sounds so pretentious,
but while I'm doing that,

2213
01:52:18,350 --> 01:52:20,810
my brain goes into another place.

2214
01:52:21,700 --> 01:52:22,530
Oh,
it's real.

2215
01:52:22,570 --> 01:52:27,570
You can't do.
You can't do that unless you're a 

2216
01:52:27,570 --> 01:52:27,570
monster.
It's a.

2217
01:52:27,570 --> 01:52:29,260
But it's also the thing.
See very happy.

2218
01:52:29,261 --> 01:52:30,340
When I retired it,
by the way,

2219
01:52:31,230 --> 01:52:34,840
I was really quite taken aback.
I was very impressed by it.

2220
01:52:35,160 --> 01:52:36,880
I thought it was hilarious to begin 
with,

2221
01:52:36,881 --> 01:52:40,810
but the fact that you would go there,
I thought that was really interesting.

2222
01:52:40,811 --> 01:52:43,330
And comedians are like that because they
go into dark places.

2223
01:52:43,720 --> 01:52:48,720
They're tricksters.
They're a mediator between the normal 

2224
01:52:48,720 --> 01:52:49,250
world in the world of the gods.
They're tricksters.

2225
01:52:49,790 --> 01:52:54,790
So it was very funny to watch you do 
that and I wondered how far you would 

2226
01:52:54,790 --> 01:52:58,571
let yourself get into it.
But I think part of the reason that 

2227
01:52:58,571 --> 01:53:00,560
you're appealing to people,
if you don't mind me saying this,

2228
01:53:00,561 --> 01:53:05,561
you know,
I'm not trying to be forward 

2229
01:53:05,561 --> 01:53:05,750
particularly,
but I thought about it a lot,

2230
01:53:05,751 --> 01:53:09,170
is that you're a tough guy and you tell 
the truth,

2231
01:53:09,680 --> 01:53:10,940
but it's both of those together.

2232
01:53:10,940 --> 01:53:15,940
That's what's doing it because you know,
people don't look at us and think like 

2233
01:53:16,190 --> 01:53:19,550
holier than thou preacher,
that isn't what they think.

2234
01:53:20,060 --> 01:53:25,060
They think tough guy who's trying to 
figure things out like right on.

2235
01:53:25,970 --> 01:53:27,410
That's good.
That's a good year.

2236
01:53:27,411 --> 01:53:32,411
A good figure for the times because this
whole war against the fellow egocentrism

2237
01:53:33,320 --> 01:53:35,780
need calls forward.
People who are like you.

2238
01:53:35,870 --> 01:53:39,050
If we're lucky.
And those are guys who have this warrior

2239
01:53:39,051 --> 01:53:40,700
end because you know,
you're a fighter.

2240
01:53:41,960 --> 01:53:44,150
So.
And if you're going to be a fighter,

2241
01:53:44,151 --> 01:53:46,910
you have to want to win and you have to 
want to hurt people.

2242
01:53:46,911 --> 01:53:48,410
I mean,
not for the sake of hurting them.

2243
01:53:48,411 --> 01:53:50,420
That's what makes you different than an 
evil person.

2244
01:53:51,290 --> 01:53:56,290
But you have to have that capacity,
you have to develop that and you know 

2245
01:53:56,290 --> 01:53:57,080
that's the step on the way to 
enlightenment,

2246
01:53:57,081 --> 01:53:59,240
weirdly enough,
because that isn't what people think.

2247
01:53:59,740 --> 01:54:04,740
Well,
I definitely think that truth is a 

2248
01:54:04,740 --> 01:54:07,321
valuable commodity in this very bizarre 
time and I think that's also one of the 

2249
01:54:07,321 --> 01:54:11,971
reasons why you are very popular as a.
You have stuck your neck out in a world 

2250
01:54:11,971 --> 01:54:16,000
that does not encourage it,
nor nor academia.

2251
01:54:16,010 --> 01:54:18,670
Not only does it not occurred,
it encourages the exact opposite.

2252
01:54:18,671 --> 01:54:23,671
Encourages you to stick your head in the
books and just to in some way,

2253
01:54:24,161 --> 01:54:29,161
shape or form.
Go with the tide like whichever way it 

2254
01:54:29,161 --> 01:54:29,830
is and get your tenure and just.

2255
01:54:30,330 --> 01:54:32,070
Yeah,
well it's intellectual pride,

2256
01:54:32,420 --> 01:54:37,420
you know,
but I don't consider myself an 

2257
01:54:37,420 --> 01:54:37,420
intellectual precisely.
What do you consider yourself?

2258
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:42,330
What is an intellectual if you're not,
how about nobody?

2259
01:54:42,420 --> 01:54:43,290
Well,
the thing,

2260
01:54:43,730 --> 01:54:46,140
see,
because my ideas aren't disembodied.

2261
01:54:47,120 --> 01:54:52,120
I act them out.
But to be an intellectual romantic in 

2262
01:54:52,120 --> 01:54:52,120
some sense.
Well,

2263
01:54:52,120 --> 01:54:55,170
I don't live in my head exactly and an 
influential some degree,

2264
01:54:55,171 --> 01:54:58,560
but what is an intellectual do then you 
say,

2265
01:54:58,580 --> 01:55:01,740
do you think of it as a pejorative?
When you think of the term intellectual,

2266
01:55:01,741 --> 01:55:04,380
do you think of it as a limited person?
Well,

2267
01:55:04,440 --> 01:55:08,220
it's a funny thing in this book called 
zero through strip.

2268
01:55:08,280 --> 01:55:13,280
Nisha has is his Zarathustra come down 
from a mountain top after being 

2269
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:16,911
enlightened and he sees this,
he goes into the public square and 

2270
01:55:16,911 --> 01:55:20,961
there's this little tiny being there 
like an inch high and it has a gigantic 

2271
01:55:20,961 --> 01:55:25,191
ear on it and it's talking and people 
are gathered around listening and that 

2272
01:55:25,191 --> 01:55:27,480
was sort of niches metaphor for an 
intellectual,

2273
01:55:29,370 --> 01:55:33,750
mostly little except maybe the rational 
faculty or something like that.

2274
01:55:33,750 --> 01:55:38,670
Expanded to monstrous dimensions,
unbalanced in that manner and,

2275
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:39,660
and,
and,

2276
01:55:39,850 --> 01:55:43,410
and prone to become the subject of 
totalitarian.

2277
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:48,980
That's the worship of the rational mind 
that the Catholic church always warned 

2278
01:55:48,980 --> 01:55:48,980
against.
You know,

2279
01:55:48,980 --> 01:55:53,361
it's not like the Catholic church.
Of course I have to say that I won't 

2280
01:55:53,361 --> 01:55:54,960
even say it or you don't need to know.
That's right.

2281
01:55:54,990 --> 01:55:55,920
That's right.
So,

2282
01:55:56,100 --> 01:56:01,100
but the point is they had a warning and 
the warning was that the rational mind 

2283
01:56:01,100 --> 01:56:01,590
like to fall in love with its own 
creations.

2284
01:56:02,910 --> 01:56:05,910
Right?
So the term intellectual,

2285
01:56:05,911 --> 01:56:10,911
the problem is that it identifies one 
aspect and it it,

2286
01:56:12,150 --> 01:56:17,150
it sort of defines one aspect of 
behavior and thinking only one.

2287
01:56:17,340 --> 01:56:18,780
Yeah,
it's the intellect as well.

2288
01:56:18,781 --> 01:56:20,330
What happens is,
is it's like,

2289
01:56:20,640 --> 01:56:22,670
it's like the intellect is raised to 
the,

2290
01:56:22,790 --> 01:56:26,160
to the status of highest God.
That's the right way to think.

2291
01:56:26,200 --> 01:56:27,890
Seeing the God idea here.

2292
01:56:27,930 --> 01:56:29,970
Here's another way of thinking about it.
That's quite cool.

2293
01:56:29,971 --> 01:56:33,870
I learned this from you and you can take
it for what it's worth.

2294
01:56:34,300 --> 01:56:39,300
I'm the highest ideal that a person 
holds consciously or unconsciously.

2295
01:56:40,110 --> 01:56:45,060
That's their God.
It functions in precisely that manner.

2296
01:56:45,750 --> 01:56:46,680
And people might say,
well,

2297
01:56:46,681 --> 01:56:47,970
I don't believe in God.
It's like,

2298
01:56:47,971 --> 01:56:49,380
well,
it depends on what you mean.

2299
01:56:49,740 --> 01:56:52,590
Like I know I'm not being,
I'm not being foolish about that.

2300
01:56:52,650 --> 01:56:57,650
It's like we're very complicated 
creatures and we're run by all sorts of 

2301
01:56:57,650 --> 01:56:59,490
very strange things down there in the 
unconscious.

2302
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:04,520
You know,
and the Greeks thought we were the 

2303
01:57:04,520 --> 01:57:04,520
playthings of the Gods because we serve 
lust,

2304
01:57:04,650 --> 01:57:07,050
we serve thirst,
we serve hunger,

2305
01:57:07,140 --> 01:57:09,330
we serve rage,
you know,

2306
01:57:09,331 --> 01:57:13,160
and those things all transcend us.
So that's why they were gods.

2307
01:57:13,420 --> 01:57:14,130
You know,
rage.

2308
01:57:14,131 --> 01:57:15,270
That's the war.
God.

2309
01:57:15,990 --> 01:57:16,950
Well,
why is it a god?

2310
01:57:16,951 --> 01:57:18,390
Well,
it exists forever.

2311
01:57:18,900 --> 01:57:23,900
It exists in all people.
It takes them over and directs their 

2312
01:57:23,900 --> 01:57:23,900
behavior.
It's a god.

2313
01:57:24,210 --> 01:57:24,930
Well,
you can.

2314
01:57:24,950 --> 01:57:27,160
You can quibble about the details.
No,

2315
01:57:27,180 --> 01:57:28,410
it's not a god.
Okay,

2316
01:57:28,411 --> 01:57:31,860
fine.
It's a psychological force to people get

2317
01:57:32,100 --> 01:57:34,260
too hung up on that one word.
Well,

2318
01:57:34,261 --> 01:57:35,580
they don't.
They don't really.

2319
01:57:36,100 --> 01:57:38,850
We have to think about it functionally 
to some degree.

2320
01:57:38,851 --> 01:57:40,830
We have to think about what that idea 
means.

2321
01:57:41,460 --> 01:57:41,850
What?
I mean,

2322
01:57:41,851 --> 01:57:45,630
we had that idea forever.
It isn't just some superstition.

2323
01:57:45,930 --> 01:57:50,930
Jesus,
we've got to be more sophisticated than 

2324
01:57:50,930 --> 01:57:50,930
that man.
You know,

2325
01:57:50,930 --> 01:57:51,830
and that's partly.
Well,

2326
01:57:51,831 --> 01:57:56,831
this is partly what,
what I think is unfortunate about the 

2327
01:57:56,831 --> 01:57:57,000
new atheists,
let's say,

2328
01:57:57,010 --> 01:57:59,670
is they don't take the damn problem 
seriously.

2329
01:58:00,090 --> 01:58:00,810
They think,
well,

2330
01:58:00,811 --> 01:58:02,910
Christianity,
that's just a bunch of superstition.

2331
01:58:02,940 --> 01:58:04,920
It's like,
really?

2332
01:58:06,180 --> 01:58:07,920
No,
sorry,

2333
01:58:08,160 --> 01:58:09,930
that's just not deep enough,
man.

2334
01:58:10,560 --> 01:58:15,560
So what it really is is the accounts of 
people trying to work out the issues of 

2335
01:58:17,341 --> 01:58:20,130
being a human.
Let me give you another example.

2336
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:22,260
This is so cool.
This is so cool.

2337
01:58:22,290 --> 01:58:27,180
It's northrop Frye who is a biblical 
scholar in at the University of Toronto.

2338
01:58:27,570 --> 01:58:32,570
This was.
This was one of his elucidations of the 

2339
01:58:32,570 --> 01:58:35,631
structure of the Bible.
The Bible is actually a story and which 

2340
01:58:35,631 --> 01:58:36,270
is weird because it's a whole bunch of 
different books written by a whole bunch

2341
01:58:36,271 --> 01:58:41,271
of different people edited kind of Willy
Nilly over thousands of years and then 

2342
01:58:41,271 --> 01:58:42,460
assembled,
you know by committee.

2343
01:58:42,460 --> 01:58:45,550
It's a really strange book,
but it has a narrative structure.

2344
01:58:46,240 --> 01:58:51,240
So that sort of emerged as a collective 
decision across these thousands of 

2345
01:58:51,280 --> 01:58:54,070
years.
So the Old Testament.

2346
01:58:54,340 --> 01:58:56,380
Here's the rough story.
In the Old Testament,

2347
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:02,140
Israel is sort of a middle power and it 
rises to power,

2348
01:59:03,340 --> 01:59:08,340
so and domination and then it a profit 
or rises and says,

2349
01:59:08,411 --> 01:59:10,390
look,
you guys are all successful now.

2350
01:59:10,780 --> 01:59:15,780
You starting to get corrupt.
You're not paying attention to the 

2351
01:59:15,780 --> 01:59:17,821
widows and children.
You're not running your state according 

2352
01:59:17,821 --> 01:59:19,300
to the superordinate principle.
You might say,

2353
01:59:19,301 --> 01:59:24,301
well,
the superordinate principal doesn't 

2354
01:59:24,301 --> 01:59:24,301
exist.
It's like,

2355
01:59:24,301 --> 01:59:25,210
okay,
keep it running it that way and see what

2356
01:59:25,211 --> 01:59:27,400
the hell happens.
That's what the prophet says.

2357
01:59:27,401 --> 01:59:29,890
Usually at the risk of his life.
He says that to the king,

2358
01:59:30,450 --> 01:59:35,450
so I find you don't believe in God.
You don't believe in the superordinate 

2359
01:59:35,450 --> 01:59:36,040
principle.
Let's say that the superordinate ethical

2360
01:59:36,041 --> 01:59:37,300
principle,
no problem.

2361
01:59:37,360 --> 01:59:39,460
Keep doing what you're doing.
Let's see what happens.

2362
01:59:39,790 --> 01:59:42,510
What happens is in real gets wiped out,
you know,

2363
01:59:42,520 --> 01:59:46,420
and then for generations it's enslaved 
or its population is being destroyed and

2364
01:59:46,421 --> 01:59:51,421
then it sorta climbs back up to power 
and then it gets powerful for a brief 

2365
01:59:52,481 --> 01:59:55,390
period of time and it gets corrupt and 
profit comes up and says,

2366
01:59:55,900 --> 01:59:59,140
you remember that superordinate 
principle that you made a covenant with?

2367
01:59:59,260 --> 02:00:01,420
You're not paying any attention to it 
anymore.

2368
02:00:01,480 --> 02:00:04,840
You better look the hell out and 
everyone ignores it and bang.

2369
02:00:05,140 --> 02:00:06,970
So it's,
it's order,

2370
02:00:07,990 --> 02:00:09,310
corruption,
chaos,

2371
02:00:10,060 --> 02:00:11,710
order,
corruption,

2372
02:00:11,800 --> 02:00:14,200
chaos.
That happened six times now.

2373
02:00:14,201 --> 02:00:15,940
So here's the night.
There's an idea behind it.

2374
02:00:16,300 --> 02:00:18,700
The idea,
because the state keeps rising.

2375
02:00:18,910 --> 02:00:20,500
There's an idea that emerges out of 
that,

2376
02:00:20,501 --> 02:00:25,501
that the aim is the perfect state.
That's a utopian dream that arises out 

2377
02:00:25,931 --> 02:00:30,931
of that.
Let's call it learned process over 

2378
02:00:30,931 --> 02:00:30,931
thousands of years.

2379
02:00:30,931 --> 02:00:35,310
If we could only get the state perfect.
If we could only get the state of 

2380
02:00:35,310 --> 02:00:35,310
perfect,
well,

2381
02:00:35,310 --> 02:00:37,810
let's say like the state of Israel or 
the or the Russian state,

2382
02:00:37,811 --> 02:00:42,811
the communist state.
If we could only bring utopia in at the 

2383
02:00:42,811 --> 02:00:43,180
political level,
our problems would be solved.

2384
02:00:43,990 --> 02:00:48,990
Well then what happens is there's a 
transition in conceptualization that 

2385
02:00:49,091 --> 02:00:52,690
happens with the new testament and the 
new testament conceptualization is,

2386
02:00:52,960 --> 02:00:55,630
wait a minute,
the state isn't salvation.

2387
02:00:57,130 --> 02:01:00,910
The individual is salvation.
Now you say,

2388
02:01:00,911 --> 02:01:02,950
well,
we're going to just throw that out.

2389
02:01:02,951 --> 02:01:05,770
Are We?
That was a hell of a discovery man.

2390
02:01:06,400 --> 02:01:11,400
It was a and then there's more to it.
It's not only is the individual 

2391
02:01:11,400 --> 02:01:14,221
salvation,
it's the truthful individual that 

2392
02:01:14,221 --> 02:01:16,750
salvation you think of how difficult a 
concept like that is to develop.

2393
02:01:17,140 --> 02:01:19,780
If there's anything less self evident 
than that,

2394
02:01:20,400 --> 02:01:21,820
you know,
because you think,

2395
02:01:21,821 --> 02:01:23,390
well,
who's going to run the dominant target?

2396
02:01:23,390 --> 02:01:26,110
It's like the biggest bloody monster 
with a club.

2397
02:01:26,590 --> 02:01:27,190
It's like,
no,

2398
02:01:27,191 --> 02:01:31,030
it turns out those are unstable.
Those societies are unstable.

2399
02:01:31,330 --> 02:01:33,430
They don't work.
They collapse into chaos.

2400
02:01:33,700 --> 02:01:38,700
They get corrupt,
they lose sight of the superordinate 

2401
02:01:38,700 --> 02:01:38,700
principle.
Whatever that is.

2402
02:01:39,500 --> 02:01:44,500
The stable solution is the individual 
that tells the truth and it's taken us 

2403
02:01:44,500 --> 02:01:48,731
forever to figure that out,
and that's partly what the 

2404
02:01:48,731 --> 02:01:50,750
postmodernists thereafter.
That's their anti fellow egocentrism.

2405
02:01:51,080 --> 02:01:53,540
That's why they skitter off and hide in 
the radiology.

2406
02:01:53,720 --> 02:01:56,660
They're afraid to come out.
They're afraid to be seen.

2407
02:01:56,990 --> 02:01:59,600
They're afraid to speak because they 
have nothing to say,

2408
02:02:00,680 --> 02:02:05,680
so we have to get sophisticated about 
this stuff or we're going to throw it 

2409
02:02:05,680 --> 02:02:07,570
away without understanding it.
It's.

2410
02:02:07,840 --> 02:02:10,710
It's unbelievable like that stories.
It's.

2411
02:02:11,030 --> 02:02:15,290
It's,
it's the story upon Western civilization

2412
02:02:15,500 --> 02:02:19,100
is the story upon which Western 
civilization is founded.

2413
02:02:19,490 --> 02:02:24,490
That's why Nisha said when God was dead,
that everything would collapse into 

2414
02:02:24,490 --> 02:02:24,490
chaos.

2415
02:02:24,490 --> 02:02:27,320
He didn't say that triumphantly.
He knew what was gonna happen,

2416
02:02:27,350 --> 02:02:32,350
so to Dostoevsky.
That's why I admire those people so 

2417
02:02:32,350 --> 02:02:32,420
much.
They knew what was coming,

2418
02:02:33,620 --> 02:02:38,620
so what I've been trying to do,
and I've been guided in large part by 

2419
02:02:38,620 --> 02:02:39,500
young because he was the first seed 
young took niches problem,

2420
02:02:39,501 --> 02:02:41,150
seriously neat.
You said,

2421
02:02:41,151 --> 02:02:42,620
look,
we're losing our faith.

2422
02:02:42,650 --> 02:02:46,730
We're losing our ability to relate to 
the superordinate ethical principle,

2423
02:02:47,270 --> 02:02:50,010
and he actually blame Christianity for 
killing itself with the,

2424
02:02:50,050 --> 02:02:52,900
with the sword of truth that it had 
produced said,

2425
02:02:52,901 --> 02:02:55,040
so we're going to lose this,
and it's big trouble.

2426
02:02:55,041 --> 02:03:00,041
Make no mistake about it because our 
whole society is founded on those 

2427
02:03:00,041 --> 02:03:02,921
principles.
We get rid of the animating spirit at 

2428
02:03:02,921 --> 02:03:02,921
the base of it.
We're going to lose all of it.

2429
02:03:03,080 --> 02:03:04,940
So and niche.
You thought,

2430
02:03:04,941 --> 02:03:06,920
well,
we're gonna have to become superhuman to

2431
02:03:06,950 --> 02:03:07,550
manage it.

2432
02:03:07,750 --> 02:03:12,750
Not.
That's where his concept of the overman 

2433
02:03:12,750 --> 02:03:12,750
comes from,
or the Superman,

2434
02:03:12,750 --> 02:03:14,270
which the Nazis sort of pulled off and 
parodied.

2435
02:03:14,271 --> 02:03:18,100
I would say now young,
you see human was a student of niches,

2436
02:03:18,110 --> 02:03:20,090
not directly,
but very much influenced by him.

2437
02:03:21,050 --> 02:03:26,050
Young thought that Nisha was wrong,
that we couldn't create our own values 

2438
02:03:26,050 --> 02:03:27,170
because look,
it's so hard to create your own value.

2439
02:03:27,410 --> 02:03:32,410
So let's say you're kind of an 
overweight guy and you decided to go to 

2440
02:03:32,410 --> 02:03:34,250
the gym for your New Year's resolution.
It's like you don't.

2441
02:03:34,900 --> 02:03:39,900
You go twice and then you stop and it's 
because you can't create your own 

2442
02:03:39,900 --> 02:03:39,900
values,
right?

2443
02:03:39,900 --> 02:03:41,300
It's hard.
You're not your own slave.

2444
02:03:41,630 --> 02:03:44,330
You can't just tell yourself what to do.
You have a nature.

2445
02:03:45,110 --> 02:03:48,800
And so young's idea was while that we 
had to go back to the mythology,

2446
02:03:48,920 --> 02:03:50,420
we had to go back to the stories.

2447
02:03:50,540 --> 02:03:55,540
We had to go back into the underground 
unconscious chaos and lift out what we 

2448
02:03:55,551 --> 02:04:00,551
had forgotten and that's what he was 
trying to do with his psychology and 

2449
02:04:00,551 --> 02:04:01,940
he's done it very effectively.
The very,

2450
02:04:01,941 --> 02:04:06,941
very effectively.
He was a revolutionary thinker but very 

2451
02:04:06,941 --> 02:04:10,691
difficult to understand.
And so I've been working with ewing's 

2452
02:04:10,691 --> 02:04:13,561
ideas for a long time trying to,
I would say make them more rational and 

2453
02:04:14,791 --> 02:04:17,390
articulate.
Not Believe me,

2454
02:04:17,391 --> 02:04:20,450
that's no critique because every time I 
go back to young,

2455
02:04:20,790 --> 02:04:24,020
which I do from time to time thinking 
I've kind of mastered him.

2456
02:04:24,021 --> 02:04:25,850
I learned a bunch of stuff that I didn't
know.

2457
02:04:26,420 --> 02:04:29,450
So.
But so what I've been trying to do is to

2458
02:04:29,451 --> 02:04:34,451
resurrect God.
I'm trying to resurrect the dormant 

2459
02:04:34,451 --> 02:04:38,921
logos,
I suppose if you have to put it that 

2460
02:04:38,921 --> 02:04:38,921
way.
That's I'm trying to do

2461
02:04:38,921 --> 02:04:43,100
and it's mostly in mostly in men and 
they're starving for it because I could 

2462
02:04:43,100 --> 02:04:44,160
mostly in men.
I don't know.

2463
02:04:44,250 --> 02:04:49,250
That just seems to be what's happening.
Like about 90 percent of my viewers on 

2464
02:04:49,250 --> 02:04:51,660
youtube are men,
but then when I go speak publicly,

2465
02:04:51,661 --> 02:04:53,700
it's all men.
What the hell are they doing?

2466
02:04:53,701 --> 02:04:55,770
Come in to hear somebody speak.
Men Don't do that,

2467
02:04:55,771 --> 02:04:57,240
right?
Women do that.

2468
02:04:58,110 --> 02:05:03,110
And so.
And then I talked to them about truth 

2469
02:05:03,110 --> 02:05:05,241
and responsibility and their eyes light 
up because it's like no one ever 

2470
02:05:05,241 --> 02:05:07,290
mentioned that before and now it's.
It just boggles my mind.

2471
02:05:07,980 --> 02:05:10,530
I'm asking you because I feel like 
that's a.

2472
02:05:10,920 --> 02:05:15,920
That is a gigantic theme today that men 
searching for some sort of reason or 

2473
02:05:17,791 --> 02:05:21,830
some sort of,
I guess without using,

2474
02:05:21,930 --> 02:05:23,580
without a better word,
path,

2475
02:05:23,940 --> 02:05:27,180
some sort of path.
I mean it seems to be very,

2476
02:05:27,181 --> 02:05:32,160
very prevalent today in almost all,
all walks of life.

2477
02:05:32,880 --> 02:05:37,200
Men feel disenfranchised with this world
that they find themselves stuck in.

2478
02:05:37,560 --> 02:05:40,110
There's a reason that superhero movies 
are so popular,

2479
02:05:40,880 --> 02:05:42,300
you know,
that's polytheism.

2480
02:05:42,580 --> 02:05:45,750
The return of polytheism for all intents
and purposes.

2481
02:05:45,751 --> 02:05:47,010
I mean,
what the hell are those things?

2482
02:05:47,011 --> 02:05:52,011
They're demigods.
Obviously one of them is thor for God's 

2483
02:05:52,011 --> 02:05:52,011
sake.
I mean account more obvious.

2484
02:05:52,011 --> 02:05:53,640
Could it be,
you know,

2485
02:05:53,641 --> 02:05:54,450
and so the.
You might say,

2486
02:05:54,451 --> 02:05:56,280
well,
who's the leader of the Demi Gods?

2487
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:58,860
Because that's the person you really 
want to follow,

2488
02:05:59,610 --> 02:06:00,780
right?
Yeah,

2489
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:01,440
yeah.
Well,

2490
02:06:01,441 --> 02:06:03,570
the evolutionary answer to that is,
well,

2491
02:06:03,660 --> 02:06:07,440
the evolutionary answer to that as far 
as the Christian route went,

2492
02:06:07,470 --> 02:06:12,470
was Christ,
but there's been lots of embodiments of 

2493
02:06:12,470 --> 02:06:12,470
that.
For the Mesopotamians,

2494
02:06:12,470 --> 02:06:15,030
it was Marduk.
Marduk was the savior figure.

2495
02:06:15,031 --> 02:06:18,570
He had eyes all the way around his head 
and he spoke magic words.

2496
02:06:18,750 --> 02:06:20,880
That was his fund.
That's what made them different from all

2497
02:06:20,881 --> 02:06:21,660
the other gods.

2498
02:06:21,990 --> 02:06:26,990
And he was elected by,
other than all the other gods to be 

2499
02:06:26,990 --> 02:06:29,571
their king.
And then he went out and fought tie 

2500
02:06:29,571 --> 02:06:31,940
matt,
who's a great dragon and made the world 

2501
02:06:31,940 --> 02:06:34,761
out of her pieces.
One of his names was he who makes 

2502
02:06:34,761 --> 02:06:35,340
ingenious things out of the combat with 
Time Matt.

2503
02:06:35,610 --> 02:06:40,610
Well,
that's what human beings do is they go 

2504
02:06:40,610 --> 02:06:40,610
out into the unknown,
into chaos,

2505
02:06:40,610 --> 02:06:41,400
and they make ingenious things out of 
it.

2506
02:06:41,970 --> 02:06:46,970
That's what we do,
and so that he's the found Marduk was 

2507
02:06:46,970 --> 02:06:46,970
the founder of,
of,

2508
02:06:46,970 --> 02:06:51,250
of Mesopotamian civilization,
and you could think about all those 

2509
02:06:51,250 --> 02:06:51,840
tribes came together to make 
Mesopotamia.

2510
02:06:52,100 --> 02:06:57,100
They will have to God,
and so then those gods went to war and 

2511
02:06:57,100 --> 02:06:59,730
out of that war of God's image,
God emerged.

2512
02:06:59,750 --> 02:07:04,750
That was Martin and Martin is one of the
sources for the figure of Christ that 

2513
02:07:04,750 --> 02:07:06,810
happened all over the place like you see
the admirable man.

2514
02:07:07,200 --> 02:07:08,970
Then you see 10 out broomball Ben and 
you think,

2515
02:07:08,971 --> 02:07:10,650
wow,
those guys have something in common.

2516
02:07:11,340 --> 02:07:16,340
That's what you remember about Muci.
You remember the heroic things they've 

2517
02:07:16,340 --> 02:07:19,911
done because they stick in your memory 
because they fit the pattern and then 

2518
02:07:19,911 --> 02:07:23,841
you start telling the story about the 
heroic things that a bunch of them did 

2519
02:07:23,841 --> 02:07:26,871
it all that mail debates together and 
then you come out with your culture 

2520
02:07:26,871 --> 02:07:26,871
here,
your God.

2521
02:07:26,871 --> 02:07:29,640
Now there's like 50 tribes,
they each have their own gods,

2522
02:07:29,641 --> 02:07:30,810
will all the way,
what are you going to do?

2523
02:07:30,811 --> 02:07:35,811
Then the gods go to war over centuries 
and then they elect new God Marduk and 

2524
02:07:36,511 --> 02:07:41,511
in the case of the Mesopotamians and 
he's the thing that goes out and fights 

2525
02:07:41,511 --> 02:07:43,780
the dragon of chaos can makes the world.
It's like,

2526
02:07:43,781 --> 02:07:45,790
yeah,
that's exactly what he is.

2527
02:07:46,450 --> 02:07:50,350
You do that with truth because truth 
introduces you to chaos.

2528
02:07:50,830 --> 02:07:55,830
Why do you think though it's so much of 
an issue with males as opposed to 

2529
02:07:55,830 --> 02:07:57,760
females in our society.
Maybe females already have enough to do.

2530
02:07:58,900 --> 02:08:00,130
Really,
really like maybe.

2531
02:08:00,160 --> 02:08:02,380
Maybe men have to take this on 
voluntarily.

2532
02:08:02,830 --> 02:08:05,200
That's what it looks like to me because 
like you can,

2533
02:08:05,380 --> 02:08:09,850
you can screw around til you're 50.
You could still have a family,

2534
02:08:09,970 --> 02:08:14,970
you've got time and you can sit down and
do nothing if you want.

2535
02:08:15,190 --> 02:08:20,190
You can do it so,
but you shouldn't because it's horrible 

2536
02:08:20,190 --> 02:08:25,051
to do that.
People who do it know it like it's 

2537
02:08:25,051 --> 02:08:25,051
meaningless.
It's wild.

2538
02:08:25,051 --> 02:08:26,230
It's funny thing about meaninglessness.
This.

2539
02:08:26,260 --> 02:08:28,990
There's no such thing when people say 
their lives aren't,

2540
02:08:29,180 --> 02:08:30,760
are meaningless,
that isn't what they mean.

2541
02:08:31,240 --> 02:08:34,450
They mean I'm in pain and anxious all 
the time.

2542
02:08:35,080 --> 02:08:36,730
That's what they mean.
Those are meanings,

2543
02:08:36,731 --> 02:08:38,860
man.
You don't get neutral,

2544
02:08:38,880 --> 02:08:39,940
you know,
I'm just sitting around.

2545
02:08:39,940 --> 02:08:41,200
I'm not feeling anything.
It's like,

2546
02:08:41,201 --> 02:08:41,820
no,
no,

2547
02:08:41,840 --> 02:08:46,840
I'm sorry that doesn't happen.
So when you say do nothing that your 

2548
02:08:47,351 --> 02:08:49,480
life is meaningless,
if you're doing nothing,

2549
02:08:49,970 --> 02:08:51,970
what do you mean by doing nothing?
Well,

2550
02:08:51,971 --> 02:08:55,090
by not accepting any response,
by not lifting a great load,

2551
02:08:55,091 --> 02:08:57,190
by not acting out the archetype of the 
hero,

2552
02:08:57,191 --> 02:08:59,170
that's what people are.
That's where men are.

2553
02:08:59,650 --> 02:09:02,650
If there's anything there or 
mythological heroes,

2554
02:09:02,651 --> 02:09:05,500
if there anything through some path,
whatever it is,

2555
02:09:05,530 --> 02:09:07,150
lots of paths mean.
So look,

2556
02:09:07,151 --> 02:09:12,151
there's an old mid evil idea.
This is the idea of the imitation of 

2557
02:09:12,151 --> 02:09:15,631
Christ.
This is something that young elaborates 

2558
02:09:15,631 --> 02:09:15,631
on a lot.
He,

2559
02:09:15,631 --> 02:09:19,050
he believed.
This is one of the things that he said 

2560
02:09:19,050 --> 02:09:19,900
was that you're,
you're the proper goal of a Christian.

2561
02:09:20,050 --> 02:09:25,050
Roughly speaking is to enact the,
the Meta pattern of Christ's life in 

2562
02:09:26,501 --> 02:09:29,290
their own to make it their own story.

2563
02:09:29,530 --> 02:09:31,720
And so what did he mean by that?
Well,

2564
02:09:31,721 --> 02:09:35,080
part of it is c,
one of the things that characterizes the

2565
02:09:35,081 --> 02:09:37,090
mythological figure of Christ,
let's say,

2566
02:09:37,091 --> 02:09:40,510
is that he takes on the burden of 
mortality voluntarily.

2567
02:09:41,460 --> 02:09:44,410
He accepts it as a precondition of 
existence.

2568
02:09:45,220 --> 02:09:47,770
And we have to do that because otherwise
we get resentful.

2569
02:09:48,220 --> 02:09:50,200
Like life is hard.
Make no mistake about it.

2570
02:09:50,530 --> 02:09:52,540
People's lives are tragic.
You know,

2571
02:09:52,541 --> 02:09:57,541
if you pick a random person off the 
street and you ask them about their 

2572
02:09:57,541 --> 02:09:57,541
life,
man,

2573
02:09:57,541 --> 02:09:57,930
usually there's things that have 
happened there.

2574
02:09:58,590 --> 02:10:01,150
You know,
they just beggar the imagination.

2575
02:10:01,180 --> 02:10:03,940
It's no wonder people are angry and 
resentful and bitter.

2576
02:10:04,660 --> 02:10:09,660
But the way out of that is to accept it,
to accept your mortality and that helps 

2577
02:10:09,701 --> 02:10:14,701
you transcend it.
That's partly what the crucifix symbol 

2578
02:10:14,701 --> 02:10:14,701
means because it was,
it was,

2579
02:10:14,701 --> 02:10:19,100
it was accepted voluntarily.
You have to accept your death 

2580
02:10:19,100 --> 02:10:19,100
voluntarily.

2581
02:10:19,100 --> 02:10:24,060
That's part of the path of the hero.
It's a very difficult thing to do 

2582
02:10:24,060 --> 02:10:24,580
obviously.
Obviously.

2583
02:10:24,850 --> 02:10:27,450
What's your alternative?
Obviously,

2584
02:10:27,660 --> 02:10:32,660
you know,
I think people are constantly searching 

2585
02:10:32,660 --> 02:10:35,420
for that thing that you just described.
The thing of meaning,

2586
02:10:35,680 --> 02:10:40,680
you know,
having meaning in this life and that 

2587
02:10:40,680 --> 02:10:41,180
meaning has a different definition for 
everybody.

2588
02:10:41,420 --> 02:10:46,420
I mean everybody's meaning your meaning 
might be very different than mine or 

2589
02:10:46,420 --> 02:10:49,760
Jamie's.
You kind of have to have your own path 

2590
02:10:49,760 --> 02:10:52,421
and I think that's also one of the 
reasons why people are so confused is 

2591
02:10:52,421 --> 02:10:55,841
because you're thrust into an early age 
to a very rigid system of education and 

2592
02:10:56,601 --> 02:11:01,601
then have jobs and then of career 
structure where you're in this place and

2593
02:11:02,691 --> 02:11:06,440
most people don't feel like that's what 
they're supposed to be doing and we feel

2594
02:11:06,441 --> 02:11:10,430
very alienated by the very structure of 
society that we are embedded in.

2595
02:11:10,460 --> 02:11:11,510
Of course,
of course.

2596
02:11:11,511 --> 02:11:16,511
Well one of the no,
there's two primary masculine 

2597
02:11:16,511 --> 02:11:19,661
mythological figures and one is the wise
king and the other is the king who 

2598
02:11:19,661 --> 02:11:22,800
devours his own son.
That's the district.

2599
02:11:22,820 --> 02:11:25,130
That's the,
that's the patriarchy that the feminists

2600
02:11:25,131 --> 02:11:26,210
are always talking about.
Well,

2601
02:11:26,211 --> 02:11:29,240
of course it's always there.
So society is a destructive force.

2602
02:11:29,241 --> 02:11:31,280
It doesn't care about you as an 
individual.

2603
02:11:31,880 --> 02:11:36,880
It needs you to be part of society.
It needs you to adopt the norms and to 

2604
02:11:36,880 --> 02:11:40,781
squelch your peculiar individuality and 
be a cog and to be socialized and you 

2605
02:11:41,511 --> 02:11:45,670
know to him yourself in and control 
yourself and not be impulsive and yeah,

2606
02:11:45,740 --> 02:11:47,780
it's a tyrant,
but the thing is,

2607
02:11:47,781 --> 02:11:51,170
society isn't only a tyrant.
That's the thing.

2608
02:11:51,530 --> 02:11:53,630
It's like how about a little gratitude 
in there?

2609
02:11:54,020 --> 02:11:59,020
Well,
you know people have a hard time with 

2610
02:11:59,020 --> 02:11:59,020
this because we like it when a thing is 
only one thing,

2611
02:11:59,420 --> 02:12:01,340
but society is always two things.

2612
02:12:01,940 --> 02:12:05,300
It's the thing that alienates you and 
the thing that you're benevolent.

2613
02:12:05,301 --> 02:12:10,301
Father always now tilt.
Sometimes it tilts harder towards the 

2614
02:12:10,301 --> 02:12:14,090
tyrant and now it's not so good,
but that's an archetypal reality.

2615
02:12:14,540 --> 02:12:16,880
So what do you have to contend with in 
life?

2616
02:12:16,940 --> 02:12:21,940
This is why these are architectural 
realities because everyone has to 

2617
02:12:21,940 --> 02:12:24,491
contend with them.
You have to contend with yourself and 

2618
02:12:24,491 --> 02:12:27,641
the adversary that's inside you,
that that seems to oppose your every 

2619
02:12:27,641 --> 02:12:29,150
movement.
The fact that you're not,

2620
02:12:29,810 --> 02:12:34,810
that you just can't move forward 
smoothly through life without being in 

2621
02:12:34,810 --> 02:12:38,321
conflict with yourself.
So there's a hero in the adversary on 

2622
02:12:38,321 --> 02:12:38,570
the individual level.
And then on the social level,

2623
02:12:38,571 --> 02:12:41,780
there's the wise king and the tyrant.
You're always gonna run into that.

2624
02:12:41,781 --> 02:12:43,820
I don't care if you're a Bantu tribes,
Manura,

2625
02:12:44,320 --> 02:12:49,320
a New York lawyer,
all those things you're going to run 

2626
02:12:49,320 --> 02:12:53,861
into.
And then in the natural world you're 

2627
02:12:53,861 --> 02:12:53,861
going to run into destructive element of
nature,

2628
02:12:53,861 --> 02:12:53,861
right?

2629
02:12:53,861 --> 02:12:54,890
That's the Gorgon.
You get you,

2630
02:12:55,160 --> 02:12:58,790
you let that thing get a glance at you 
and you're one like frozen poppy.

2631
02:12:59,060 --> 02:13:01,880
But also there's the benevolent element 
of nature that's feminine,

2632
02:13:01,881 --> 02:13:04,580
that's Mother Nature.
Both of those extremes.

2633
02:13:05,270 --> 02:13:08,510
So and that's the world.
That's the archetypal world.

2634
02:13:08,960 --> 02:13:12,350
And it's because it's eternal as far as 
human beings are concerned,

2635
02:13:12,351 --> 02:13:15,050
those things are always there.
That's our true environment.

2636
02:13:15,410 --> 02:13:17,830
It's not these things we see around us.
There are,

2637
02:13:17,970 --> 02:13:19,340
they're lasting,
no time.

2638
02:13:20,120 --> 02:13:25,120
These other things last forever.
And that's what we're adapted to where 

2639
02:13:25,120 --> 02:13:26,480
we're adapted to the things that last 
forever.

2640
02:13:27,530 --> 02:13:32,530
So,
but yet we go through this finite life 

2641
02:13:32,530 --> 02:13:33,250
searching for meaning.
Well,

2642
02:13:33,320 --> 02:13:37,770
and it's funny to note where meaning 
seems to locate itself.

2643
02:13:38,400 --> 02:13:40,590
You want a meaning that justifies the 
suffering.

2644
02:13:41,820 --> 02:13:44,370
It's something like that that's a 
transcendent meaning.

2645
02:13:44,371 --> 02:13:45,960
It's like this,
this is hard,

2646
02:13:46,200 --> 02:13:47,040
but it's worth it.

2647
02:13:47,370 --> 02:13:48,300
Okay,
so what do you do?

2648
02:13:48,510 --> 02:13:50,850
Pick something worth it.
Right?

2649
02:13:50,940 --> 02:13:54,270
That's partly what I tried to get people
to do with that future authoring program

2650
02:13:54,780 --> 02:13:55,350
to say,
okay,

2651
02:13:55,351 --> 02:13:56,730
look,
here's a place to start.

2652
02:13:57,970 --> 02:14:02,650
You got your miserable self right now 
it's like three to five years out.

2653
02:14:03,760 --> 02:14:08,760
Imagine what your life could be like if 
you had what you would give yourself if 

2654
02:14:08,760 --> 02:14:11,560
you were taking care of yourself,
what would life be like?

2655
02:14:11,830 --> 02:14:16,830
Just come up with an idea even about 
that and so then people do that and then

2656
02:14:17,681 --> 02:14:22,681
they write out a plan to attain it,
and then the college kids are like 30 

2657
02:14:22,681 --> 02:14:24,310
percent more likely to stay in 
university if they do that,

2658
02:14:24,311 --> 02:14:27,640
especially if they're men,
because men need a purpose.

2659
02:14:28,570 --> 02:14:32,740
I think women have a purpose,
are they now they have two purposes.

2660
02:14:32,741 --> 02:14:35,320
You know they're going to have a family.
That's a major purpose man.

2661
02:14:35,740 --> 02:14:37,090
Like just give birth.
It's.

2662
02:14:37,091 --> 02:14:40,060
That's no joke.
And then you're devoted to something for

2663
02:14:40,061 --> 02:14:42,760
like 20 years.
You got your adventure right there.

2664
02:14:43,610 --> 02:14:46,380
Yeah,
but a lot of women find great offense in

2665
02:14:46,381 --> 02:14:51,381
someone's saying that,
especially a man saying that 

2666
02:14:51,381 --> 02:14:51,381
mansplaining,
that a woman's purpose is to breed.

2667
02:14:51,381 --> 02:14:51,470
Right?
I mean,

2668
02:14:51,471 --> 02:14:53,720
isn't that a giant issue that a lot of 
women have?

2669
02:14:54,150 --> 02:14:56,870
I didn't say that was the only purpose.
I know that you didn't.

2670
02:14:57,140 --> 02:14:58,700
Oh yeah.
People have an issue with it,

2671
02:14:58,701 --> 02:15:00,970
but it's like grow up,
you know,

2672
02:15:01,070 --> 02:15:03,680
if you're a sophisticated person as far 
as I'm concerned,

2673
02:15:07,430 --> 02:15:09,170
how many important things are there in 
life?

2674
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:12,200
Well,
one of them is family.

2675
02:15:13,030 --> 02:15:15,050
Like it's as simple as that.
Now you might say,

2676
02:15:15,051 --> 02:15:16,910
well,
family isn't the end all solution.

2677
02:15:16,911 --> 02:15:17,360
It's like,
yeah,

2678
02:15:17,361 --> 02:15:18,920
well thanks for pointing that out.
You know,

2679
02:15:19,820 --> 02:15:21,890
I've dealt with plenty of pathological 
families,

2680
02:15:22,160 --> 02:15:25,070
but it's a huge part of life.
You have a mother and a father,

2681
02:15:25,071 --> 02:15:30,071
you have children.
It places you in the world and any 

2682
02:15:30,071 --> 02:15:30,071
society that.
Look,

2683
02:15:30,071 --> 02:15:33,470
there's a reason society's worship the 
virgin mother and the child.

2684
02:15:33,950 --> 02:15:38,150
It's because societies that don't die 
and so people say,

2685
02:15:38,151 --> 02:15:38,840
well,
you know,

2686
02:15:38,841 --> 02:15:41,750
that relationship between mother and 
child isn't the only thing.

2687
02:15:41,751 --> 02:15:42,470
Okay,
fine.

2688
02:15:42,471 --> 02:15:45,350
It's still a sacred thing and you miss 
it.

2689
02:15:45,380 --> 02:15:46,670
You miss it.
If you're female,

2690
02:15:46,671 --> 02:15:48,410
you miss that at your peril.
Now,

2691
02:15:48,411 --> 02:15:53,411
that doesn't mean there aren't women who
shouldn't miss it because maybe they 

2692
02:15:53,411 --> 02:15:54,080
have another purpose that's that 
transcends that,

2693
02:15:54,350 --> 02:15:56,420
but that's rare.
It's very,

2694
02:15:56,421 --> 02:16:00,890
very rare and I would caution any women 
listening if they're young,

2695
02:16:01,220 --> 02:16:04,640
not to be diluted into the idea that 
their career is,

2696
02:16:04,641 --> 02:16:06,860
that will be up such high quality that 
it's self.

2697
02:16:06,861 --> 02:16:11,861
Evidently trump's having a family.
You have to have a hell of a career 

2698
02:16:11,861 --> 02:16:14,540
before that's the case.
So

2699
02:16:16,620 --> 02:16:19,350
don't you think that's unique to the 
individual though that some people just,

2700
02:16:19,920 --> 02:16:24,920
they'll be more satisfied and I mean,
depending on what they're doing 

2701
02:16:24,920 --> 02:16:26,190
artistically or creatively or whatever 
it is,

2702
02:16:26,370 --> 02:16:28,380
you can't make rules for the 
exceptional,

2703
02:16:28,570 --> 02:16:29,650
right?
You know,

2704
02:16:29,680 --> 02:16:30,010
they do

2705
02:16:30,010 --> 02:16:31,390
what they're going to do.
Those are open.

2706
02:16:31,450 --> 02:16:33,880
Maybe those are open people.
They have genius level Iq,

2707
02:16:33,881 --> 02:16:38,881
like they're.
They're spectacular in some manner and 

2708
02:16:38,881 --> 02:16:39,850
so there's a reason they're going to 
step outside the norm.

2709
02:16:40,030 --> 02:16:42,130
They're shape shifters,
no problem.

2710
02:16:42,310 --> 02:16:44,280
There's always gonna be people like that
and we need them.

2711
02:16:44,400 --> 02:16:49,400
How they know when they're that well,
telling the truth is a good start 

2712
02:16:49,780 --> 02:16:51,940
because then you don't fool yourself 
about who you are.

2713
02:16:52,880 --> 02:16:55,180
You know?
That's another one of the things I tried

2714
02:16:55,181 --> 02:16:58,780
to think through is why you should tell 
the truth so it's not self evident,

2715
02:16:58,781 --> 02:16:59,770
man,
smart kid.

2716
02:16:59,800 --> 02:17:01,810
The smarter the kid,
the earlier they learn to lie.

2717
02:17:02,560 --> 02:17:07,560
Lying is very powerful because you can 
manipulate the world with your language 

2718
02:17:07,560 --> 02:17:11,820
and then you can get what you want lots 
of times or escape from things that you 

2719
02:17:11,820 --> 02:17:12,190
don't want.
So why not lie all the time?

2720
02:17:13,270 --> 02:17:15,070
Well,
I think the reason is there's a bunch of

2721
02:17:15,071 --> 02:17:20,071
reasons,
but one of the myths is that you can't 

2722
02:17:20,071 --> 02:17:20,140
trust yourself if you lie and there's 
going to be times in your life where you

2723
02:17:20,141 --> 02:17:25,141
have no one to turn to except you.
And so if you've stuffed yourself full 

2724
02:17:25,141 --> 02:17:28,981
of lies,
then you're going to be in a crisis one 

2725
02:17:28,981 --> 02:17:31,051
day and you're going to have to make a 
decision and you're going to decide 

2726
02:17:31,051 --> 02:17:33,391
wrong and you're going to be in real 
trouble because you won't have the 

2727
02:17:33,391 --> 02:17:36,721
clarity of mind necessary to make the 
proper judgment because you've filled 

2728
02:17:36,721 --> 02:17:39,160
your imagination and your perception 
with with rubbish.

2729
02:17:40,750 --> 02:17:42,190
So,
and if you really think that through,

2730
02:17:42,191 --> 02:17:47,191
you see there's this old idea in the old
testament that fear of God is the 

2731
02:17:47,191 --> 02:17:48,220
beginning of wisdom.
And I kind of understand what that means

2732
02:17:49,420 --> 02:17:52,090
because one of the things say we do with
the future authoring program,

2733
02:17:52,450 --> 02:17:53,830
we offer people a little heaven.

2734
02:17:53,860 --> 02:17:54,550
It's like,
okay,

2735
02:17:55,540 --> 02:17:59,290
construct your ideal aim added.
Come up with a plan.

2736
02:17:59,620 --> 02:18:01,270
You get a modify the plan,
no problem.

2737
02:18:01,480 --> 02:18:03,700
You're going to do a bad job of it.
No problem.

2738
02:18:03,790 --> 02:18:05,440
Just do it.
Okay?

2739
02:18:05,441 --> 02:18:08,830
So then now you've got a goal,
and now you're approach systems.

2740
02:18:09,100 --> 02:18:14,100
Technically speaking,
the positive emotion systems that 

2741
02:18:14,100 --> 02:18:16,831
motivate you are you are engaged because
they're engaged in relationship to a 

2742
02:18:16,831 --> 02:18:18,370
goal and the more transcendent goal,
the more they're engaged.

2743
02:18:18,730 --> 02:18:23,730
But that's not good enough.
It's great to run towards something you 

2744
02:18:23,730 --> 02:18:27,011
like,
but it's even better to run away from 

2745
02:18:27,011 --> 02:18:27,011
something that terrifies you.
So then we ask people,

2746
02:18:27,011 --> 02:18:27,520
okay,
so here,

2747
02:18:27,521 --> 02:18:32,521
think about this real carefully.
Take all your faults and your 

2748
02:18:32,521 --> 02:18:34,210
inadequacies and your hatred for life,
all of that,

2749
02:18:34,870 --> 02:18:39,870
and then imagine that gets the upper 
hand and then think about where you 

2750
02:18:39,870 --> 02:18:40,180
could be in three to five years.

2751
02:18:40,540 --> 02:18:41,580
Everyone knows,
hey,

2752
02:18:42,100 --> 02:18:43,960
some people know they'd be a street 
person,

2753
02:18:43,961 --> 02:18:48,961
some people know they'd be an alcoholic,
some people know they'd be a prostitute 

2754
02:18:48,961 --> 02:18:52,201
or a drug addict,
like everybody's got their own little 

2755
02:18:52,201 --> 02:18:54,751
hell they could descend into with a fair
degree of rapidity and a fair bit of 

2756
02:18:54,751 --> 02:18:56,440
enjoyment and people know that.
And so I say,

2757
02:18:56,441 --> 02:18:57,970
well,
delineate that out too.

2758
02:18:58,300 --> 02:19:01,510
So you know where you're headed when you
fall off the path.

2759
02:19:02,170 --> 02:19:04,600
And so then you're running away and 
running towards like,

2760
02:19:04,601 --> 02:19:05,890
yes,
well that's heaven.

2761
02:19:05,891 --> 02:19:09,160
Inhale and you need it.
And they're real.

2762
02:19:09,490 --> 02:19:11,200
They're as real as anything that you 
can.

2763
02:19:12,910 --> 02:19:15,490
It depends on what you mean by a real,
I suppose,

2764
02:19:15,520 --> 02:19:20,520
but there's real as you make them.
How about that and people can make hell 

2765
02:19:20,891 --> 02:19:25,891
pretty real.
People do seem to construct these 

2766
02:19:25,891 --> 02:19:26,560
pitfalls for themselves.
I mean,

2767
02:19:26,561 --> 02:19:31,561
self sabotage is one of the most common 
things that you find in people that are 

2768
02:19:32,511 --> 02:19:33,110
struggling.

2769
02:19:34,210 --> 02:19:39,210
I mean,
you would think that someone who is 

2770
02:19:39,210 --> 02:19:40,460
struggling,
the last thing they'd want to do is help

2771
02:19:40,461 --> 02:19:44,690
themselves towards their own demise,
but it's super common.

2772
02:19:45,080 --> 02:19:46,970
Yeah.
Well I thought about that too,

2773
02:19:46,971 --> 02:19:50,990
and so you tell me what you think about 
this as if you talked to people.

2774
02:19:50,991 --> 02:19:51,500
They say,
well,

2775
02:19:51,501 --> 02:19:55,070
I want to have a meaningful life.
Generally people want that,

2776
02:19:55,640 --> 02:19:57,680
but then you think,
well then why aren't you?

2777
02:19:58,490 --> 02:19:59,240
And then you think,
well,

2778
02:19:59,241 --> 02:20:00,770
what does it mean to have a meaningful 
life?

2779
02:20:00,771 --> 02:20:02,600
Exactly.
And then you think,

2780
02:20:02,601 --> 02:20:07,601
well,
maybe it means that you have to take on 

2781
02:20:07,601 --> 02:20:09,371
responsibility because you're,
your sacrifices have to be worth 

2782
02:20:09,371 --> 02:20:09,371
something,
right?

2783
02:20:09,371 --> 02:20:11,360
It has to have some cows to have some 
meat.

2784
02:20:11,570 --> 02:20:16,570
What you're aiming at.
It has to be something that can elevate 

2785
02:20:16,570 --> 02:20:19,070
your worm,
like self to the level of tolerability.

2786
02:20:19,370 --> 02:20:20,060
You know?
You can say,

2787
02:20:20,061 --> 02:20:21,410
well yeah,
I've got all these flaws,

2788
02:20:21,411 --> 02:20:25,890
but look at what I'm trying to do.
That's the real ground of self respect.

2789
02:20:26,720 --> 02:20:27,050
Well,

2790
02:20:32,040 --> 02:20:34,680
I missed.
I'm off the track with the question.

2791
02:20:35,030 --> 02:20:37,680
Ground of self respect.
I can't remember what you asked me,

2792
02:20:38,700 --> 02:20:41,550
so we'll have to go to a different 
topic.

2793
02:20:43,240 --> 02:20:43,960
What,
what,

2794
02:20:44,040 --> 02:20:46,230
how did we get on this?
We were um,

2795
02:20:46,710 --> 02:20:49,530
you asked about the evolutionary basis 
of.

2796
02:20:51,080 --> 02:20:56,080
That was a long time ago.
I know it's a rabbit hole that just 

2797
02:20:56,080 --> 02:20:58,851
doesn't disappear.
But where will we just now remember 

2798
02:20:58,851 --> 02:21:00,440
where we were just now?
No,

2799
02:21:00,570 --> 02:21:05,570
sorry.
Distracted by something else that's 

2800
02:21:05,570 --> 02:21:05,570
happening right now.
I'll give you,

2801
02:21:05,570 --> 02:21:05,580
let you know.
What is it?

2802
02:21:05,880 --> 02:21:08,040
Columbia just got fired by trump a 
little bit.

2803
02:21:08,070 --> 02:21:13,070
Oh,
and a twitter is a about.

2804
02:21:14,820 --> 02:21:17,940
This is a little off topic,
but I mean,

2805
02:21:18,420 --> 02:21:19,790
you want to talk about a finger.
Oh,

2806
02:21:19,800 --> 02:21:21,410
I know.
We were talking about men.

2807
02:21:21,900 --> 02:21:26,900
Yes.
We're talking about men and what 

2808
02:21:26,900 --> 02:21:26,900
motivates them.
Yes.

2809
02:21:26,900 --> 02:21:27,600
And so then we were talking about the 
fact that,

2810
02:21:28,260 --> 02:21:30,240
you know,
when I'm speaking publicly now,

2811
02:21:30,300 --> 02:21:32,940
most of my audience is men and that 
their eyes light up when they're.

2812
02:21:33,240 --> 02:21:38,240
So we were,
we were talking about the necessity of 

2813
02:21:38,240 --> 02:21:39,030
taking on the burden of a responsibility
because people,

2814
02:21:39,240 --> 02:21:42,990
not only are we,
should we be acting out the archetype of

2815
02:21:42,991 --> 02:21:47,991
the hero,
but we should be carrying the weight 

2816
02:21:47,991 --> 02:21:49,200
while we're doing it because we're,
we're like pack animals.

2817
02:21:49,530 --> 02:21:52,560
We're not happy without a wait.
And I think it's.

2818
02:21:52,680 --> 02:21:57,680
I do think it's something like they have
to justify your miserable existence.

2819
02:21:58,320 --> 02:22:00,420
Do you think,
and this is my theory about that,

2820
02:22:00,900 --> 02:22:05,730
I believe that there are certain human 
reward systems that we have ingrained in

2821
02:22:05,731 --> 02:22:10,731
us and that have allowed us to survive 
this long and that these reward systems,

2822
02:22:11,520 --> 02:22:16,520
a lot of them entail overcoming struggle
because struggle was inexorable.

2823
02:22:16,980 --> 02:22:21,300
It was a massive part of existence.
And that without struggle,

2824
02:22:21,630 --> 02:22:23,010
our body is almost like,
well,

2825
02:22:23,011 --> 02:22:25,410
how come we're not hug?
I'm not overcoming something.

2826
02:22:25,411 --> 02:22:25,560
Yeah.

2827
02:22:25,620 --> 02:22:27,180
Right?
So it's almost like a trick.

2828
02:22:27,540 --> 02:22:32,540
Like you have to trick your body and you
trick your brain and trick your 

2829
02:22:32,540 --> 02:22:32,540
humanity,
your,

2830
02:22:32,540 --> 02:22:37,230
your very existence into having some 
sort of a purpose in order to be at a 

2831
02:22:37,230 --> 02:22:37,230
baseline.
Yeah.

2832
02:22:37,230 --> 02:22:38,410
Well,
I'm going to make sense.

2833
02:22:39,120 --> 02:22:40,140
It does make sense,
but I,

2834
02:22:40,141 --> 02:22:41,580
I don't.
I don't think.

2835
02:22:41,730 --> 02:22:46,730
I don't think it's a trick here.
Here's why I think that because I think 

2836
02:22:46,730 --> 02:22:48,900
there is something irreducible about 
suffering.

2837
02:22:49,170 --> 02:22:49,920
I think it,
it,

2838
02:22:50,130 --> 02:22:50,760
it,
it,

2839
02:22:51,010 --> 02:22:54,540
it speaks for itself as a reality and 
unquestionable reality.

2840
02:22:54,820 --> 02:22:59,820
No,
nobody says to a child that's in severe 

2841
02:22:59,820 --> 02:23:00,210
pain and that it isn't going to matter 
in a million years.

2842
02:23:00,660 --> 02:23:03,150
Right?
The pain trumps everything.

2843
02:23:03,210 --> 02:23:08,210
Right?
So then it seems to me that attempts to 

2844
02:23:08,210 --> 02:23:10,170
alleviate suffering trump everything.
So if you want to responsibility,

2845
02:23:10,171 --> 02:23:11,040
it's like,
there you go.

2846
02:23:11,080 --> 02:23:13,530
One try,
argue your way out of that.

2847
02:23:13,620 --> 02:23:14,970
It doesn't matter.
Fine.

2848
02:23:16,020 --> 02:23:18,750
Your suffering doesn't matter then 
that's for sure.

2849
02:23:18,810 --> 02:23:20,400
No,
none of this suffering matters.

2850
02:23:20,670 --> 02:23:23,220
You're going to go down that road are 
you know,

2851
02:23:23,250 --> 02:23:28,250
you know what?
You know what the face of someone who 

2852
02:23:28,250 --> 02:23:29,790
says that no suffering matter matters.
Looks like it's not pleasant.

2853
02:23:30,600 --> 02:23:34,740
So there's no neutral position with 
regards to that.

2854
02:23:35,310 --> 02:23:37,920
So you see the world is full of 
unrequited suffering,

2855
02:23:37,921 --> 02:23:42,921
let's say,
and who knows how much of it is 

2856
02:23:42,921 --> 02:23:44,661
unnecessary.
Certainly the stuff you create seems to 

2857
02:23:44,661 --> 02:23:47,751
be unnecessary,
especially if he created purposefully 

2858
02:23:47,751 --> 02:23:48,210
and people are doing that all the time.
So if you need a burden,

2859
02:23:48,211 --> 02:23:53,211
it's like,
how about how about dampening down the 

2860
02:23:53,211 --> 02:23:56,961
unnecessary suffering a little bit about
trying hard to do that for the rest of 

2861
02:23:56,961 --> 02:23:57,960
your life.
See if that'll do it.

2862
02:23:58,740 --> 02:24:02,540
And God only knows how far you'd get you
might get along waste,

2863
02:24:02,570 --> 02:24:02,900
man.

2864
02:24:03,530 --> 02:24:06,180
When,
when people talk about meaning though,

2865
02:24:06,240 --> 02:24:08,910
when you talk about suffering and this,
uh,

2866
02:24:08,911 --> 02:24:13,911
this idea like what is,
what is going on in the mind that 

2867
02:24:14,161 --> 02:24:17,310
desires this difficult pursuit?
Like what,

2868
02:24:17,311 --> 02:24:22,311
what is going on?
Like why is that a part of being a 

2869
02:24:22,311 --> 02:24:25,371
person?
Like why is it a part of your ultimate 

2870
02:24:25,371 --> 02:24:29,061
happiness to have these obstacles to 
overcome and these character developing 

2871
02:24:29,061 --> 02:24:30,390
moments,
character,

2872
02:24:30,391 --> 02:24:35,391
building episodes in order for you to 
manage life and to get through life with

2873
02:24:36,001 --> 02:24:39,810
the most amount of happiness.
There's a story about this.

2874
02:24:40,080 --> 02:24:43,170
I think it's a frog and the Scorpion.
You know the story.

2875
02:24:43,590 --> 02:24:44,310
Well,
the frog,

2876
02:24:44,311 --> 02:24:44,880
please.
Yeah,

2877
02:24:44,881 --> 02:24:45,600
well,
the frog,

2878
02:24:45,630 --> 02:24:50,630
the Scorpion convinces the frog to give 
him the right across the river and the 

2879
02:24:50,630 --> 02:24:50,910
frog says,
well,

2880
02:24:50,911 --> 02:24:51,990
you're a scorpion.
It's like,

2881
02:24:52,100 --> 02:24:57,100
you know,
I'm not going to do that because you're 

2882
02:24:57,100 --> 02:24:57,100
going to nail me with your tail.

2883
02:24:57,100 --> 02:24:57,530
And the Scorpion says,
no,

2884
02:24:57,531 --> 02:25:02,531
no,
if I do that when we're in the river 

2885
02:25:02,531 --> 02:25:02,531
will both drowned.
So why would I do that?

2886
02:25:02,531 --> 02:25:07,311
So the frog agrees to ferry the Scorpion
across and they get halfway out and 

2887
02:25:07,311 --> 02:25:10,140
Scorpion stings the frog says turns to 
him with his dying breath and says,

2888
02:25:10,141 --> 02:25:11,670
why'd you do that?
And the Scorpion said,

2889
02:25:11,671 --> 02:25:12,780
well,
it's in my nature,

2890
02:25:13,530 --> 02:25:16,260
and that's the answer to your question,
is that it's in our nature.

2891
02:25:16,470 --> 02:25:18,930
That's what an archetype is.
We're the hero.

2892
02:25:18,931 --> 02:25:21,370
Archetype is the story of men.
Right?

2893
02:25:21,410 --> 02:25:25,780
But do you think that that nature,
because that is how we survived,

2894
02:25:25,810 --> 02:25:30,810
how over the millions of years will 
evolve from lower hominids to being a 

2895
02:25:30,810 --> 02:25:34,210
human being,
is that we needed to have the mechanisms

2896
02:25:34,390 --> 02:25:39,390
in,
in our very existence to overcome 

2897
02:25:39,390 --> 02:25:39,390
struggle.
Then all of a sudden,

2898
02:25:39,390 --> 02:25:40,480
Joel,
maybe we chose it.

2899
02:25:40,870 --> 02:25:41,890
You know,
you think,

2900
02:25:41,920 --> 02:25:46,920
well,
I mean I think it is part of the 

2901
02:25:46,920 --> 02:25:46,920
evolutionary process,
but look,

2902
02:25:46,920 --> 02:25:51,210
the thing about sexual selection or the 
mechanisms that we talked about say 

2903
02:25:51,210 --> 02:25:53,590
whereby the dominance hierarchy is the 
selection mechanism for,

2904
02:25:53,610 --> 02:25:55,270
for the transfer of genetic material.

2905
02:25:55,270 --> 02:26:00,270
There's a choice in that if a group of 
guys gets to get together and a leader 

2906
02:26:00,270 --> 02:26:00,270
emerge,
someone,

2907
02:26:00,270 --> 02:26:02,620
everyone respects.
It's like an election.

2908
02:26:02,740 --> 02:26:06,400
Everyone voted on it.
We chose that particular type of person.

2909
02:26:06,550 --> 02:26:07,690
Well who is that?
Well,

2910
02:26:07,691 --> 02:26:12,691
that's the heroic type.
Human beings have chosen that and then 

2911
02:26:12,691 --> 02:26:12,691
the women think,
oh look,

2912
02:26:12,691 --> 02:26:16,681
I heroic type.
It's like they grabbed them before 

2913
02:26:16,681 --> 02:26:17,950
someone else gets it,
and so that's been going on forever.

2914
02:26:18,640 --> 02:26:20,200
So did we choose it?
Well,

2915
02:26:21,190 --> 02:26:23,980
the action of our choice across 
millennia selected it.

2916
02:26:25,090 --> 02:26:26,920
These are things evolutionary 
psychologists,

2917
02:26:26,921 --> 02:26:31,921
biologists don't think about.
They don't think about the role that 

2918
02:26:31,921 --> 02:26:35,371
consciousness played in determining who 
survived and how and why it's been going

2919
02:26:35,471 --> 02:26:40,471
on for a long time.
While they certainly know about sexual 

2920
02:26:40,471 --> 02:26:41,120
selection by female choice,
you know,

2921
02:26:41,200 --> 02:26:44,110
but the full implications of that 
haven't been thought through.

2922
02:26:44,940 --> 02:26:48,730
Like I've just really started to grapple
with the idea that the male hierarchy is

2923
02:26:48,820 --> 02:26:50,140
sexual selection device.

2924
02:26:51,400 --> 02:26:52,990
It's like the men are voting on well,
who,

2925
02:26:53,260 --> 02:26:55,210
which of us deserves to go sleep with a 
woman.

2926
02:26:55,300 --> 02:26:56,170
It's like,
well you don't,

2927
02:26:56,171 --> 02:26:58,170
you're kind of a weaselly little snake,
so you know,

2928
02:26:58,240 --> 02:26:59,050
not,
not you.

2929
02:26:59,051 --> 02:26:59,560
It's like,
oh,

2930
02:26:59,561 --> 02:27:01,330
Joe,
Joe looks like quite the guy.

2931
02:27:01,570 --> 02:27:03,370
Let's put him at the top of the 
hierarchy.

2932
02:27:04,810 --> 02:27:07,060
That's what men have been doing with 
each other forever.

2933
02:27:08,440 --> 02:27:12,250
Isn't there more to it than that?
There's a lot to that because of.

2934
02:27:12,251 --> 02:27:14,500
The question is who is it that they're 
electing,

2935
02:27:14,620 --> 02:27:16,870
but is it really just about sexual 
selection?

2936
02:27:18,650 --> 02:27:20,290
That's a good question.
Joe.

2937
02:27:20,530 --> 02:27:25,530
Freud thought so.
Like it's half about that get say half.

2938
02:27:26,740 --> 02:27:27,510
Well,
you know,

2939
02:27:27,520 --> 02:27:30,700
there's the survival of the individual 
and the survival of the species.

2940
02:27:31,630 --> 02:27:35,260
So those are the two things,
but in the.

2941
02:27:35,290 --> 02:27:39,040
But even with that sexual selection,
even with that,

2942
02:27:40,270 --> 02:27:45,270
say if a person does rise to the top of 
the social hierarchy in that small 

2943
02:27:45,520 --> 02:27:49,480
Dunbar's number of 250 people,
the person,

2944
02:27:49,481 --> 02:27:50,170
is that enough?

2945
02:27:50,200 --> 02:27:55,200
Does that person still need purpose?
Do they still need something in some 

2946
02:27:55,200 --> 02:27:56,160
difficult struggle for them to feel 
fulfilled?

2947
02:27:56,161 --> 02:27:57,880
For most of,
for most of human history,

2948
02:27:57,881 --> 02:28:01,590
that just wasn't a problem because you 
had struggle constantly,

2949
02:28:01,750 --> 02:28:02,590
man.
Yes,

2950
02:28:02,591 --> 02:28:07,591
absolutely.
Any problem today that is that the 

2951
02:28:07,591 --> 02:28:07,591
problem,
our lack of problems?

2952
02:28:07,591 --> 02:28:11,730
Sure.
It's something kierkegaard pointed out 

2953
02:28:11,730 --> 02:28:13,740
like 150 years ago.
He said they'll come a time when 

2954
02:28:13,740 --> 02:28:14,670
everything has been done so well for 
everyone that the only lack,

2955
02:28:15,220 --> 02:28:18,010
the only felt lack will be for lack 
itself.

2956
02:28:18,250 --> 02:28:22,070
Are you concerned because of that and 
because you're acutely aware of this

2957
02:28:22,070 --> 02:28:27,070
issue or concern with this potential 
future that we have in front of us with 

2958
02:28:27,070 --> 02:28:30,940
artificial intelligence and virtual 
reality in this need to live in a world 

2959
02:28:30,940 --> 02:28:35,231
that's not real like I mean,
how many kids today listening to this 

2960
02:28:35,231 --> 02:28:38,330
exist for a massive amount of their day,
watching video games,

2961
02:28:38,331 --> 02:28:40,660
playing video games,
playing the archetypal hero,

2962
02:28:40,690 --> 02:28:45,590
and I had a friend,
and this is a classic story.

2963
02:28:45,591 --> 02:28:47,630
I'll never forget this statement that he
said to me.

2964
02:28:47,631 --> 02:28:50,720
He was one of the managers at the comedy
store who's a very nice guy,

2965
02:28:50,721 --> 02:28:54,320
but he was addicted to video games,
which I have been in the past.

2966
02:28:54,680 --> 02:28:56,580
I was addicted to video games for a 
couple of years,

2967
02:28:57,320 --> 02:28:58,700
might play them all the time.
I loved them.

2968
02:28:58,701 --> 02:29:01,250
There was so much fun,
but this guy,

2969
02:29:01,520 --> 02:29:02,930
he had it bad.
I was.

2970
02:29:02,931 --> 02:29:06,290
I had a career while I was doing it.
I managed to figure it out that this was

2971
02:29:06,291 --> 02:29:08,060
a massive waste of my time and get 
through.

2972
02:29:08,270 --> 02:29:13,270
He didn't and when one day he was like,
I mean Pale,

2973
02:29:15,081 --> 02:29:20,081
like he hadn't been outside days and he 
was hanging out in the back of the 

2974
02:29:20,081 --> 02:29:22,040
comedy store and we were talking and he 
was addicted to,

2975
02:29:22,041 --> 02:29:27,041
I think it was ever quest,
which was this crazy roleplaying game 

2976
02:29:27,041 --> 02:29:31,061
that you just do and you just.
People would play it 18 hours a day and 

2977
02:29:31,061 --> 02:29:32,360
he said something I'll never forget.
He said,

2978
02:29:32,900 --> 02:29:37,900
I'm so successful in the video game 
world and so unsuccessful in the real 

2979
02:29:38,721 --> 02:29:43,721
world.
I think it was like sitting there like 

2980
02:29:43,721 --> 02:29:43,721
shaking his head.
It was like,

2981
02:29:43,721 --> 02:29:45,650
wow.
In the real world.

2982
02:29:46,040 --> 02:29:49,490
He was like very unfulfilled.
Couldn't find a girlfriend,

2983
02:29:49,740 --> 02:29:53,270
was struggling financially in the video 
game world.

2984
02:29:53,450 --> 02:29:58,450
He was like,
some warlock is out there slaying 

2985
02:29:58,450 --> 02:30:01,121
dragons and in and he found great reward
in that video game world.

2986
02:30:02,340 --> 02:30:07,130
I am very concerned that we will 
literally almost be like in the matrix,

2987
02:30:07,131 --> 02:30:10,880
plugged into some artificial electronic 
thing,

2988
02:30:11,060 --> 02:30:16,060
which I think these,
these video games that people are 

2989
02:30:16,060 --> 02:30:16,060
playing all day long,
they're a precursor to that.

2990
02:30:16,060 --> 02:30:17,990
Don't get me along if you have great 
self control.

2991
02:30:17,991 --> 02:30:19,460
They're very enjoyable,
they're fun,

2992
02:30:19,640 --> 02:30:21,920
they're great social time with you and 
your friends get together,

2993
02:30:21,921 --> 02:30:26,921
you play and you have a great.
As long as you're actually being 

2994
02:30:26,921 --> 02:30:26,921
productive and active in our everyday 
life.

2995
02:30:26,960 --> 02:30:28,280
I don't really think there are a 
problem,

2996
02:30:28,490 --> 02:30:33,490
but my concern is that they are a 
precursor and that we are seeing the 

2997
02:30:33,490 --> 02:30:35,210
beginning steps to this artificial world
that,

2998
02:30:35,211 --> 02:30:38,420
that we will be embedded in,
in the very near future.

2999
02:30:39,380 --> 02:30:40,070
Well,
you know,

3000
02:30:40,150 --> 02:30:45,150
we,
we decided already that we're in a 

3001
02:30:45,150 --> 02:30:47,090
period of chaos and you know,
part of the reason I'm loath to make any

3002
02:30:47,091 --> 02:30:49,370
predictions is,
I mean that's one of the reasons.

3003
02:30:49,400 --> 02:30:52,790
It's like how many things need to be 
going sideways at the same time.

3004
02:30:53,150 --> 02:30:55,380
Lots of things are going sideways.
Oh,

3005
02:30:55,470 --> 02:30:57,470
I have no idea what's going to happen.
I mean,

3006
02:30:57,471 --> 02:30:59,750
we're building autonomous cars.
Seventy,

3007
02:30:59,900 --> 02:31:04,520
like that's the biggest employment 
category driver.

3008
02:31:04,610 --> 02:31:07,970
Yeah.
So what then you know,

3009
02:31:08,150 --> 02:31:09,590
but why?
Why worry about that?

3010
02:31:09,591 --> 02:31:11,060
There's 20 other things that are 
happening.

3011
02:31:11,061 --> 02:31:13,970
They're just as revolutionary.
So what's going to happen?

3012
02:31:15,320 --> 02:31:17,150
Who knows?
I have no idea.

3013
02:31:17,780 --> 02:31:20,310
I think maybe I know how to steer the 
boat.

3014
02:31:20,910 --> 02:31:25,910
You know,
that's all he tried to tell the truth 

3015
02:31:25,910 --> 02:31:29,240
and maybe you'll get through it and 
acted out as well because what else do 

3016
02:31:29,240 --> 02:31:32,490
you have is not another fantastic sign 
of chaos.

3017
02:31:33,050 --> 02:31:34,800
I say fantastic.
Not in a positive way,

3018
02:31:35,370 --> 02:31:38,040
but that Donald Trump is our president.
Now.

3019
02:31:38,130 --> 02:31:43,130
The president has who has had the 
biggest problem with the truth that 

3020
02:31:43,130 --> 02:31:45,450
we've ever experienced.
We've never experienced a president like

3021
02:31:45,451 --> 02:31:49,380
this where we know that he has a problem
with the truth and it's,

3022
02:31:49,410 --> 02:31:50,910
it's,
it's open,

3023
02:31:51,280 --> 02:31:52,060
it's,
it's,

3024
02:31:52,110 --> 02:31:57,110
it doesn't seem to funnies us.
He has an unstructured problem with the 

3025
02:31:57,110 --> 02:32:00,711
truth.
He was preferred as a candidate to 

3026
02:32:00,711 --> 02:32:02,040
someone who had a structured approach to
untruth.

3027
02:32:02,110 --> 02:32:03,120
Right?
Right.

3028
02:32:03,121 --> 02:32:05,070
So it's like,
pick your type of lie.

3029
02:32:05,430 --> 02:32:10,310
You can pick the ideal ideology,
power aiming lie or a new kind of or or.

3030
02:32:10,380 --> 02:32:12,000
Yeah,
a more personal lie.

3031
02:32:12,210 --> 02:32:14,330
Say if you're going to be cynical about 
it.

3032
02:32:14,380 --> 02:32:19,380
Well,
it kind of lie to that didn't fit the 

3033
02:32:19,380 --> 02:32:20,910
standard structure that we're accustomed
to and felt very disenchanted with.

3034
02:32:22,620 --> 02:32:25,380
Yeah.
Lower maybe a nakedly self-serving lie.

3035
02:32:25,381 --> 02:32:25,860
It's like,
oh,

3036
02:32:25,861 --> 02:32:30,861
thank God,
that's such a relief after the 

3037
02:32:30,861 --> 02:32:30,861
totalitarian ideology lies.

3038
02:32:32,800 --> 02:32:35,760
Oh God,
when he said that way so fucked up.

3039
02:32:37,250 --> 02:32:39,210
That's obviously it though.
Yeah,

3040
02:32:39,211 --> 02:32:41,040
well that's definitely part of it and I 
mean,

3041
02:32:41,041 --> 02:32:46,041
lots of people did.
I know people went into the voting 

3042
02:32:46,041 --> 02:32:46,041
booth,
their hand was hovering over Hillary,

3043
02:32:46,041 --> 02:32:46,860
you know,
and it was shaking and they thought,

3044
02:32:46,861 --> 02:32:47,670
oh,
to hell with it,

3045
02:32:47,880 --> 02:32:49,920
trump.
And so,

3046
02:32:50,250 --> 02:32:55,250
and you know,
what's the sentiment that I can 

3047
02:32:55,250 --> 02:32:55,250
appreciate?
So and so here we are,

3048
02:32:55,440 --> 02:32:58,950
but that's only the tiny.
That's only the tail end of the Dragon.

3049
02:32:58,980 --> 02:32:59,970
I mean,
yeah,

3050
02:33:00,150 --> 02:33:02,490
there's,
who knows,

3051
02:33:02,491 --> 02:33:05,910
who can look ahead.
This is a strange time we're in.

3052
02:33:05,970 --> 02:33:09,360
Maybe it's associated with Kurt swells,
prognostications,

3053
02:33:09,361 --> 02:33:10,580
you know,
I mean he,

3054
02:33:10,610 --> 02:33:15,610
he talked about the consequences of an 
ever accelerating technological 

3055
02:33:15,610 --> 02:33:18,480
transformation and you know,
I mean look,

3056
02:33:18,481 --> 02:33:21,390
just in the last 50 years we've had the 
birth control,

3057
02:33:21,391 --> 02:33:24,950
the hydrogen bomb and the transistor 
thrown out as it's like,

3058
02:33:24,960 --> 02:33:27,470
man,
those are some pretty wild tornadoes.

3059
02:33:27,920 --> 02:33:28,610
And,
and,

3060
02:33:28,830 --> 02:33:33,830
and that's just scratching the surface.
So the last 100.

3061
02:33:34,980 --> 02:33:39,980
I mean,
if you just go back to the beginning of 

3062
02:33:39,980 --> 02:33:39,980
the 20th century to today,
I mean,

3063
02:33:39,980 --> 02:33:41,100
it's fucking,
it's unbelievable.

3064
02:33:41,130 --> 02:33:41,400
Yeah.
Well,

3065
02:33:41,401 --> 02:33:42,120
you know,
in 18,

3066
02:33:42,121 --> 02:33:47,121
95,
the average person in the west lived on 

3067
02:33:47,121 --> 02:33:48,210
a dollar a day in today's dollars.
In 18.

3068
02:33:48,211 --> 02:33:49,170
90 five.
Yes.

3069
02:33:49,171 --> 02:33:50,970
Really?
In today's dollars.

3070
02:33:51,160 --> 02:33:51,470
Yeah.
Yeah.

3071
02:33:51,870 --> 02:33:52,770
Wow.
Yeah.

3072
02:33:52,771 --> 02:33:54,150
Wow.
No kidding.

3073
02:33:55,080 --> 02:33:56,010
No kidding.
Well,

3074
02:33:56,011 --> 02:34:01,011
that's the other thing with the people,
when they find out how little the rest 

3075
02:34:01,011 --> 02:34:03,921
of the world lives on,
they find out that the top one percent 

3076
02:34:03,921 --> 02:34:05,160
of the world makes about $34,000
us.

3077
02:34:05,310 --> 02:34:05,730
Yeah.
Well,

3078
02:34:05,731 --> 02:34:07,890
it depends on.
I know if you're,

3079
02:34:08,210 --> 02:34:09,420
you know,
for many people,

3080
02:34:09,421 --> 02:34:11,910
someone who's rich is someone who has 
more money than them.

3081
02:34:12,200 --> 02:34:14,310
Right.
Which is one of the things I really find

3082
02:34:14,311 --> 02:34:17,010
funny about the,
like the radical left protests.

3083
02:34:17,140 --> 02:34:18,040
The campus is like

3084
02:34:18,220 --> 02:34:19,720
down with the one percent.
It's like,

3085
02:34:19,721 --> 02:34:20,890
Hey,
sunshine,

3086
02:34:21,250 --> 02:34:22,860
you're part of the one percent.
You're just,

3087
02:34:22,990 --> 02:34:26,410
you're actually a baby.
One 10th of one percent or or maybe one,

3088
02:34:26,411 --> 02:34:29,950
100th of one percent or you're just 
angry because you're not there yet,

3089
02:34:30,430 --> 02:34:35,430
but you will be when you're 40 and you 
know it and so does everybody else and 

3090
02:34:35,430 --> 02:34:38,911
now instead of regarding yourself 
properly as a fledgling member of the 

3091
02:34:39,251 --> 02:34:41,080
elite,
you want to have it both ways.

3092
02:34:41,290 --> 02:34:46,290
You want to be fledgling member of the 
elite and champion of the Undergrad 

3093
02:34:46,290 --> 02:34:49,270
under privileged,
so how narcissistic can you get?

3094
02:34:50,050 --> 02:34:55,050
You want to have all the benefits of 
having all the benefits and you want to 

3095
02:34:55,050 --> 02:34:57,751
have all the benefits of having none of 
the benefits because just all the 

3096
02:34:57,751 --> 02:35:01,021
benefits isn't enough for you.
One thing that it's a reoccurring 

3097
02:35:01,021 --> 02:35:04,561
subjects that I find incredibly 
fascinating and it keeps coming up and 

3098
02:35:04,561 --> 02:35:09,480
it's been brought up even more so lately
because of artificial intelligence and 

3099
02:35:09,480 --> 02:35:11,980
automated vehicles and all these 
different things that are happening that

3100
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:17,000
they're going to be an erosion of jobs 
and a subject keeps reoccurring and 

3101
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:20,650
that's universal basic income.
The idea of giving people,

3102
02:35:21,070 --> 02:35:23,560
giving everyone a certain amount of 
money,

3103
02:35:23,830 --> 02:35:26,500
whether it's 12,000
or $18,000,

3104
02:35:26,770 --> 02:35:28,000
what do you.
What are your thoughts on that?

3105
02:35:30,280 --> 02:35:32,910
I don't know what to think about that.
You know,

3106
02:35:33,430 --> 02:35:38,430
it certainly it would require a 
revolution in the way people consider 

3107
02:35:38,430 --> 02:35:42,640
their lives and then maybe that rev w,
what do people do with leisure time?

3108
02:35:43,840 --> 02:35:45,400
What should you do with it?
Well,

3109
02:35:45,610 --> 02:35:48,460
leisure time.
It's like what is leisure time exactly?

3110
02:35:48,520 --> 02:35:51,320
Is it?
Is it sitting in a closet like discord,

3111
02:35:51,430 --> 02:35:56,430
discarded android?
I mean that's often how people respond 

3112
02:35:56,430 --> 02:35:56,430
when they retire,
right,

3113
02:35:56,430 --> 02:36:01,381
but what they have to retire or would 
they have their needs taken care of as 

3114
02:36:01,381 --> 02:36:05,281
far as food and shelter and then be able
to pursue something that they actually 

3115
02:36:05,281 --> 02:36:08,641
enjoy and are interested in because the 
job that they were stuck in doesn't 

3116
02:36:08,641 --> 02:36:12,061
exist anymore.
That's the question and I would say I 

3117
02:36:12,061 --> 02:36:12,760
would say at the moment the data aren't 
great.

3118
02:36:13,270 --> 02:36:16,090
You know what happens to a lot of men 
who are unemployed now,

3119
02:36:16,420 --> 02:36:20,140
they've let say they've had that thrust 
upon them involuntarily,

3120
02:36:20,170 --> 02:36:24,820
but most people who we would be talking 
about would be in that situation is that

3121
02:36:25,070 --> 02:36:27,550
they get depressed,
they sit on the couch,

3122
02:36:27,790 --> 02:36:29,530
they develop chronic pain problems.

3123
02:36:29,620 --> 02:36:34,620
They start taking it will be it for the 
pain problems and then soon they're 

3124
02:36:34,630 --> 02:36:36,610
hooked.
Like it's not a pretty.

3125
02:36:36,611 --> 02:36:38,890
I mean I know that that everyone isn't 
doing that,

3126
02:36:38,891 --> 02:36:41,630
but lots of people are doing that.
So that's.

3127
02:36:41,680 --> 02:36:44,640
Unemployment is as an in kind of a 
different thing because you know,

3128
02:36:45,250 --> 02:36:50,250
well my thought is that unemployment,
if you've got something like universal 

3129
02:36:50,250 --> 02:36:50,300
basic income,
I mean I'm born,

3130
02:36:50,410 --> 02:36:55,410
we're talking about a complete 
revolution in the way society is 

3131
02:36:55,410 --> 02:36:55,410
structured,
right?

3132
02:36:55,410 --> 02:37:00,030
Because if automation does come along 
and artificial intelligence does come 

3133
02:37:00,030 --> 02:37:04,081
along and it really is a situation where
a lot of the things that people do to 

3134
02:37:04,081 --> 02:37:05,560
occupy their time in order to feed 
themselves and shelter themselves,

3135
02:37:05,590 --> 02:37:07,870
they don't exist anymore.
It's unnecessary.

3136
02:37:08,080 --> 02:37:10,060
So you're not talking about unemployment
like Bob,

3137
02:37:10,210 --> 02:37:12,670
you're not a good enough lawyer.
You've been fired.

3138
02:37:12,880 --> 02:37:13,840
And now you're like,
God,

3139
02:37:13,841 --> 02:37:15,280
I'm a failure,
I'm depressed,

3140
02:37:15,290 --> 02:37:16,340
I am unemployed.

3141
02:37:16,490 --> 02:37:20,930
We're not talking about that.
We're talking about literally society as

3142
02:37:20,931 --> 02:37:23,240
we know it.
Having a complete reset.

3143
02:37:23,300 --> 02:37:24,470
Yep.
Yeah.

3144
02:37:24,471 --> 02:37:26,930
Well I don't.
I have no idea what to say about that.

3145
02:37:27,090 --> 02:37:29,640
I don't either.
That's why I asked you to look.

3146
02:37:29,690 --> 02:37:30,770
I mean,
there are people.

3147
02:37:31,730 --> 02:37:36,680
Here's the optimistic end.
I'll speak as a determinist.

3148
02:37:36,681 --> 02:37:39,100
I'm not a determinist,
but I'm going to speak that way anyways.

3149
02:37:39,101 --> 02:37:41,960
So there are lots of people who are 
creative.

3150
02:37:42,230 --> 02:37:44,750
They're high in trade,
openness from the big five perspective,

3151
02:37:45,350 --> 02:37:50,350
they're going to go do creative things,
but there are lots of people who aren't 

3152
02:37:50,350 --> 02:37:51,530
creative,
so I don't know what they're going to do

3153
02:37:51,531 --> 02:37:53,390
because it isn't going to be creative 
things.

3154
02:37:53,420 --> 02:37:54,760
What do you think people.
Well,

3155
02:37:54,761 --> 02:37:59,000
why are people creative and noncreative?
Like are there people that are just.

3156
02:37:59,580 --> 02:38:04,580
Not that it's never been nurtured in 
them that they have the potential to be 

3157
02:38:04,580 --> 02:38:04,580
creative or do you?

3158
02:38:04,580 --> 02:38:05,480
Don't think so.
No,

3159
02:38:05,710 --> 02:38:10,710
no.
That the literature is pretty clear on 

3160
02:38:10,710 --> 02:38:10,710
that.
I mean,

3161
02:38:10,710 --> 02:38:11,090
the traits are highly heritable.
They're modifiable,

3162
02:38:11,091 --> 02:38:16,091
but if you're really non creative,
it's like it ain't going anywhere for 

3163
02:38:16,091 --> 02:38:19,391
you,
and the reason for that is creativity 

3164
02:38:19,391 --> 02:38:19,730
isn't like.
It's not all sweetness and light,

3165
02:38:19,760 --> 02:38:22,130
man.
I mean the reason there are non creative

3166
02:38:22,131 --> 02:38:24,290
people because creative people often 
died.

3167
02:38:25,100 --> 02:38:28,580
They're all doing like screwy things.
They attract attention from people.

3168
02:38:28,581 --> 02:38:31,640
They shouldn't attract attention from 
the authorities.

3169
02:38:32,390 --> 02:38:34,670
You know,
creative people are revolutionary.

3170
02:38:35,060 --> 02:38:40,060
Well,
if tyrants don't really like 

3171
02:38:40,060 --> 02:38:41,651
revolutionaries,
here's lots of reasons not to be 

3172
02:38:41,651 --> 02:38:41,651
creative.
Even now,

3173
02:38:41,651 --> 02:38:45,581
like creative people,
it's hard to monetize your creative 

3174
02:38:45,581 --> 02:38:45,770
creativity.
Artists have a hell of a time surviving,

3175
02:38:46,520 --> 02:38:46,990
right?
And,

3176
02:38:47,560 --> 02:38:51,860
and so,
so creativity has such as a.

3177
02:38:52,180 --> 02:38:57,180
it's a double edged blessing for sure.
And part of the reason that lots of 

3178
02:38:57,180 --> 02:38:57,590
people aren't creative is because it's a
lot.

3179
02:38:58,340 --> 02:39:01,460
Let's think about it from an 
evolutionary perspective is because it's

3180
02:39:01,461 --> 02:39:06,461
a hell of a lot easier not to be decked 
out in bright colors when the predators 

3181
02:39:06,461 --> 02:39:07,010
come along,
right?

3182
02:39:07,011 --> 02:39:08,960
You want to stay camouflaged against the
herd,

3183
02:39:08,961 --> 02:39:11,180
like a zebra.
You don't want to stand out.

3184
02:39:11,600 --> 02:39:16,600
I'll tell you a little story about that.
So I think I got this from Robert 

3185
02:39:16,600 --> 02:39:17,330
Sapolsky and if I didn't I apologize,
but.

3186
02:39:17,810 --> 02:39:20,600
So let's say you're a biologist to go to
study some zebras,

3187
02:39:21,170 --> 02:39:22,280
you think people think,
wow,

3188
02:39:22,281 --> 02:39:25,010
those zebras are camouflage because they
have black and white stripes.

3189
02:39:25,160 --> 02:39:27,110
Well no,
that's not camouflage.

3190
02:39:27,111 --> 02:39:29,360
Lion is camouflaged.
It's golden.

3191
02:39:29,361 --> 02:39:32,990
It looks like the grass.
You can see a zebra like 15 miles away.

3192
02:39:32,991 --> 02:39:34,940
It's black and white.
Okay,

3193
02:39:34,941 --> 02:39:36,680
so you're looking at some zebras and you
think,

3194
02:39:36,730 --> 02:39:41,730
yeah,
I need to look at one zebra to figure 

3195
02:39:41,730 --> 02:39:41,730
out what it's doing because I'm trying 
to understand zebras.

3196
02:39:41,730 --> 02:39:43,340
So you look at a zebra and then you take
some notes and look up and you think,

3197
02:39:43,341 --> 02:39:44,900
oh God.
Which zebra was that?

3198
02:39:45,260 --> 02:39:47,240
Because the camouflage is against the 
herd.

3199
02:39:48,080 --> 02:39:50,870
Just the idea that the camouflage is 
against the herd.

3200
02:39:50,871 --> 02:39:53,750
That's such a useful idea to have in 
your mind.

3201
02:39:53,780 --> 02:39:58,780
That camouflage is against the herd.
So you go up to the zebra in your jeep 

3202
02:39:58,780 --> 02:40:02,741
and you've got to stick with a rag on it
and you put a nice daub of red paint on 

3203
02:40:02,741 --> 02:40:05,450
the zebras haunch or you clip.
It seems like with a cattle clip and the

3204
02:40:05,451 --> 02:40:07,790
first thing that you know,
you get it the hell out of there and the

3205
02:40:07,791 --> 02:40:12,791
lions kill it because they can identify 
the thing that stands out and organize 

3206
02:40:13,200 --> 02:40:14,010
their hunter around it.

3207
02:40:14,370 --> 02:40:16,260
And so that's why there aren't creative 
people.

3208
02:40:16,850 --> 02:40:19,560
I think that is a Paul scan.
I think it was a rear clip.

3209
02:40:19,650 --> 02:40:21,390
I remember.
I remember this discussion.

3210
02:40:21,670 --> 02:40:26,670
Yeah.
That it's also that the edge detection 

3211
02:40:26,710 --> 02:40:27,540
animal,
like there's a,

3212
02:40:27,560 --> 02:40:32,560
there's a type of or pattern account 
flash pattern called the asap and asap 

3213
02:40:33,090 --> 02:40:36,750
camouflage doesn't look like trees.
You know,

3214
02:40:36,751 --> 02:40:41,751
when people think of pull up asap 
pattern first light l I t,

3215
02:40:43,480 --> 02:40:47,040
m military camouflage pattern all 
season,

3216
02:40:47,041 --> 02:40:50,040
all terrain can necessarily develop 
that.

3217
02:40:50,060 --> 02:40:51,480
Hey,
they just stole it.

3218
02:40:51,540 --> 02:40:52,630
Congratulations.
Yes.

3219
02:40:52,650 --> 02:40:54,300
It's one of our,
I feel like we're all one.

3220
02:40:54,510 --> 02:40:56,160
I don't believe in borders.
Um,

3221
02:40:56,170 --> 02:41:01,170
it's actually for animals.
There you could see a psat and the 

3222
02:41:01,170 --> 02:41:04,161
reason is animals can't.
They they only see in black and white,

3223
02:41:04,291 --> 02:41:09,291
like Predator prey.
Animals like deer and it's edge 

3224
02:41:09,291 --> 02:41:11,640
detection that they're looking for.
And these things,

3225
02:41:11,641 --> 02:41:13,260
the hard lines of the black.

3226
02:41:13,260 --> 02:41:16,280
And the Brown and the lighter colors,
it throws off the.

3227
02:41:16,410 --> 02:41:18,270
That's fusion.
That's a different color.

3228
02:41:19,470 --> 02:41:24,470
That's a different type of camera.
But the asap is what we're talking 

3229
02:41:24,470 --> 02:41:24,470
about,
which is right above it.

3230
02:41:24,470 --> 02:41:26,700
That leg.
Read it yet right there.

3231
02:41:26,760 --> 02:41:27,470
Bam.
Yeah,

3232
02:41:27,670 --> 02:41:29,070
that's it.
And I'm also wrong.

3233
02:41:29,071 --> 02:41:31,260
Canadians didn't invent.
This was the other stuff.

3234
02:41:31,320 --> 02:41:34,140
The military.
Other than that did a bunch of stuff.

3235
02:41:34,141 --> 02:41:37,620
I'm sure I'll give you guys A.
I'm a fan of Canada,

3236
02:41:37,621 --> 02:41:38,220
man.
I love it.

3237
02:41:38,460 --> 02:41:41,100
I really do love Canada.
I think you people up there just so much

3238
02:41:41,101 --> 02:41:42,630
nicer.
It's A.

3239
02:41:42,630 --> 02:41:46,110
I have struggled to try to figure out 
why I've thought about it many,

3240
02:41:46,111 --> 02:41:51,111
many times,
but I think people in general in Canada 

3241
02:41:51,111 --> 02:41:52,080
or I always say there's 20 percent less 
douchebags in Canada.

3242
02:41:52,170 --> 02:41:54,000
I mean there's assholes everywhere you 
go,

3243
02:41:54,001 --> 02:41:55,860
but I feel like Canada,
for whatever reason,

3244
02:41:56,130 --> 02:41:57,480
people were extremely polite.

3245
02:41:57,810 --> 02:41:58,860
Yes.
Yes.

3246
02:41:58,970 --> 02:42:00,270
I wouldn't say,
well,

3247
02:42:00,330 --> 02:42:01,410
I don't know.
I don't see.

3248
02:42:01,411 --> 02:42:06,411
I'm not sure.
I'm not convinced of it because I often 

3249
02:42:06,411 --> 02:42:06,411
think the same thing when I come down to
the U.

3250
02:42:06,411 --> 02:42:07,640
S that people are more polite.
Well that their.

3251
02:42:08,040 --> 02:42:10,350
That their level of customer service for
example,

3252
02:42:11,310 --> 02:42:16,110
but I think one of the differences 
between Canada and the US is like all of

3253
02:42:16,111 --> 02:42:19,470
Canada in some senses like the midwest 
of the United States,

3254
02:42:19,800 --> 02:42:21,690
you know,
so we don't have this,

3255
02:42:21,990 --> 02:42:26,220
we don't have this extreme culture that 
characterizes the us with the late great

3256
02:42:26,221 --> 02:42:29,370
lows and the great highs were all were 
like elevator music,

3257
02:42:29,860 --> 02:42:34,860
you know,
compared to a full symphony and there 

3258
02:42:34,860 --> 02:42:34,860
can be some really tragic parts of the 
symphony.

3259
02:42:34,860 --> 02:42:39,591
So you know,
if you want peace order and good 

3260
02:42:39,591 --> 02:42:39,591
government,
that's our constitutional credo.

3261
02:42:39,591 --> 02:42:41,550
Then you know,
Canada's your place,

3262
02:42:42,060 --> 02:42:47,060
but it's a middle class,
middle of the road society and that has 

3263
02:42:47,060 --> 02:42:47,060
some benefits,
you know,

3264
02:42:47,060 --> 02:42:51,891
it's nice and welcoming and,
and not to experimental and kind of call

3265
02:42:52,681 --> 02:42:55,200
them insecure and those are good things.
It's,

3266
02:42:55,320 --> 02:42:58,560
I don't think it's a place that is great
at dealing with excellence,

3267
02:42:58,950 --> 02:43:03,950
but know that's interesting.
Do you feel like excellence is 

3268
02:43:03,950 --> 02:43:06,270
suppressed because people don't like 
when someone stands out too much?

3269
02:43:06,450 --> 02:43:07,110
Ah,
yeah.

3270
02:43:07,510 --> 02:43:12,510
Well I think that's true everywhere,
but I think it's more true of Canada 

3271
02:43:12,510 --> 02:43:12,510
than it is of us.
I think

3272
02:43:12,510 --> 02:43:15,630
it's celebrated a lot in the US.
I mean,

3273
02:43:15,640 --> 02:43:17,830
I think there's always going to be some 
resistance,

3274
02:43:17,831 --> 02:43:22,831
especially from people that don't feel 
like people always measure themselves 

3275
02:43:22,831 --> 02:43:25,840
against someone if there's someone else 
out there is just no some genius in some

3276
02:43:25,841 --> 02:43:30,841
form or another.
There's always going to people that 

3277
02:43:30,841 --> 02:43:33,340
people that measure themselves against 
that person and find themselves coming 

3278
02:43:33,340 --> 02:43:34,960
up short so they try to attack that 
individual.

3279
02:43:35,080 --> 02:43:38,170
Someone who has just catastrophic 
success and some sort of a way.

3280
02:43:38,310 --> 02:43:43,310
Yeah,
that's another reason for the end for 

3281
02:43:43,310 --> 02:43:45,991
people to be enemies of clear thought as
well because clear thought is a good 

3282
02:43:45,991 --> 02:43:49,690
pathway to success and so if you could 
go after people who think clearly,

3283
02:43:49,691 --> 02:43:54,691
it's another way of keeping the 
dominance hierarchy nice and flat for 

3284
02:43:54,691 --> 02:43:54,910
your,
for your delectation let's say.

3285
02:43:55,020 --> 02:44:00,020
Mm.
So that's the enemy of competence 

3286
02:44:00,020 --> 02:44:00,490
element that I see as part of the social
justice warrior movement.

3287
02:44:01,730 --> 02:44:06,730
Right?
And the extreme lack of financial 

3288
02:44:06,730 --> 02:44:08,950
success and yeah,
and even creative success.

3289
02:44:08,970 --> 02:44:10,990
Well,
and even the insistence that hierarchies

3290
02:44:10,991 --> 02:44:13,300
are always based on power.
It's like neuro.

3291
02:44:13,301 --> 02:44:17,920
The hierarchy of neurosurgeons is not 
based on power or yet is obviously,

3292
02:44:17,950 --> 02:44:22,950
you know,
hierarchies are based to some degree on 

3293
02:44:22,950 --> 02:44:22,950
power.
We don't have to be juvenile about it,

3294
02:44:22,950 --> 02:44:25,120
but you know,
the best neurosurgeons actually know how

3295
02:44:25,121 --> 02:44:28,180
to do surgery.
That's not just a power thing,

3296
02:44:28,250 --> 02:44:29,560
right?
The best farmer's Hay,

3297
02:44:29,561 --> 02:44:33,310
they grow food.
So there's no,

3298
02:44:33,340 --> 02:44:38,340
there's no appreciation for actual the 
real world while there's no real world 

3299
02:44:38,340 --> 02:44:38,950
in postmodernism anyway,
so that doesn't matter,

3300
02:44:38,951 --> 02:44:43,951
but there's no appreciation for 
competence or the fact that there's 

3301
02:44:43,951 --> 02:44:46,980
individual difference in competence even
though they're always talking about 

3302
02:44:46,980 --> 02:44:50,071
diversity and there's a downplaying of 
competition and the importance of 

3303
02:44:50,071 --> 02:44:50,071
competition.
Definitely.

3304
02:44:50,071 --> 02:44:50,530
Oh yes,
yes.

3305
02:44:50,531 --> 02:44:51,670
Well that's.
Yes,

3306
02:44:51,671 --> 02:44:53,380
and that's something that's 
particularly,

3307
02:44:53,381 --> 02:44:56,680
I think,
hard on men because men compete and they

3308
02:44:56,681 --> 02:44:57,070
compete.

3309
02:44:57,070 --> 02:45:00,220
Partly because women like winners.
I mean that's part of the reason.

3310
02:45:00,580 --> 02:45:05,580
So.
And you're shamed for that in this 

3311
02:45:05,580 --> 02:45:07,120
postmodern view of the world.
Oh yeah.

3312
02:45:07,121 --> 02:45:09,400
Well,
you know the schools increasingly or non

3313
02:45:09,410 --> 02:45:12,060
competitive places.
It's like for a guy that means,

3314
02:45:12,090 --> 02:45:17,090
well,
let's tune out and go watch video games 

3315
02:45:17,090 --> 02:45:17,090
because like,
if I can't win it this,

3316
02:45:17,090 --> 02:45:19,000
why should I play well to cooperate?
It's like,

3317
02:45:19,210 --> 02:45:20,260
well,
you know,

3318
02:45:20,830 --> 02:45:21,850
fair enough,
man,

3319
02:45:21,851 --> 02:45:24,220
but I'd actually like to try to win at 
something.

3320
02:45:24,450 --> 02:45:25,990
Well,
how evil can you get?

3321
02:45:26,020 --> 02:45:27,940
Well,
it's toxic masculinity,

3322
02:45:27,941 --> 02:45:31,420
Jordan.
That one drives me fucking crazy.

3323
02:45:31,421 --> 02:45:34,480
Like what does that mean?
Toxic masculinity?

3324
02:45:34,900 --> 02:45:39,900
Toxic has an.
It has nothing to do in masculine or 

3325
02:45:39,900 --> 02:45:39,900
feminine.
If something's toxic,

3326
02:45:39,900 --> 02:45:42,100
it's toxic.
There's no toxic masculinity.

3327
02:45:42,101 --> 02:45:44,510
If someone's evil,
they do something horrible.

3328
02:45:44,511 --> 02:45:47,830
If they're gingiss con or Adolf Hitler,
that's not toxic.

3329
02:45:47,831 --> 02:45:52,831
Masculinity.
That's an evil person has nothing to do 

3330
02:45:52,831 --> 02:45:52,831
with the masculine and feminine.

3331
02:45:53,080 --> 02:45:53,710
Yeah,
well,

3332
02:45:53,740 --> 02:45:55,490
you know,
it depends on what your political agenda

3333
02:45:55,491 --> 02:45:56,290
is.
I mean,

3334
02:45:56,291 --> 02:46:01,291
men are more likely to be the type of 
person that does something awful in 

3335
02:46:01,291 --> 02:46:05,581
terms of dominating or war or violence.
It's almost in our nature in some way 

3336
02:46:07,211 --> 02:46:09,020
because of all the things that we 
discussed before,

3337
02:46:09,140 --> 02:46:11,660
we're more,
we're more likely to do something that's

3338
02:46:11,661 --> 02:46:16,661
really evident.
There's plenty of bullying that goes on 

3339
02:46:16,661 --> 02:46:20,261
behind the scenes among women are 
absolutely know it can manifest itself 

3340
02:46:20,261 --> 02:46:24,041
in naked physical aggression and I 
actually think that's hard on women in 

3341
02:46:24,041 --> 02:46:24,041
some ways.
I mean my,

3342
02:46:24,041 --> 02:46:28,380
my daughter for example,
is always mad at my son because like not

3343
02:46:29,481 --> 02:46:31,140
chronically,
but you know,

3344
02:46:31,160 --> 02:46:36,160
he'd have a dispute with one of his 
friends and maybe it would get physical 

3345
02:46:36,160 --> 02:46:38,120
and then that'd be the end of it.
They'd be friends again,

3346
02:46:38,510 --> 02:46:39,090
you know,
there was a way,

3347
02:46:39,140 --> 02:46:44,140
there is a way of bringing it to a 
conclusion and without that then things 

3348
02:46:44,140 --> 02:46:46,850
can smolder on forever and that's really
rough.

3349
02:46:46,880 --> 02:46:48,170
You know,
some.

3350
02:46:48,230 --> 02:46:53,050
Sometimes the simplest solution is a 
fight often and you know,

3351
02:46:53,420 --> 02:46:57,020
I'm not that deep so I know what you're 
saying.

3352
02:46:57,080 --> 02:47:02,080
No,
but I'm embarrassed that I would even 

3353
02:47:02,080 --> 02:47:03,790
think that I have to put some little 
quote marks around your documented 

3354
02:47:04,221 --> 02:47:06,860
developing person to.
You're talking about young people.

3355
02:47:06,970 --> 02:47:08,810
It is,
it is an issue,

3356
02:47:08,811 --> 02:47:13,811
this simmering and stewing of,
of disputes where they never come to a 

3357
02:47:13,811 --> 02:47:14,870
head and they never get resolved.
Yeah.

3358
02:47:14,871 --> 02:47:16,070
Yeah.
It's a terrible thing.

3359
02:47:16,340 --> 02:47:20,090
Terrible thing.
It's part of hell for sure to have these

3360
02:47:20,091 --> 02:47:23,300
things that are just grinding away at 
you all the time.

3361
02:47:23,430 --> 02:47:24,230
You know,
it's not.

3362
02:47:24,770 --> 02:47:27,530
It's definitely not.
It's not a good place to be in.

3363
02:47:27,531 --> 02:47:29,840
Good motivations don't come out of it.
That's for sure.

3364
02:47:31,190 --> 02:47:34,430
You've made some some statements and 
we've had some.

3365
02:47:34,850 --> 02:47:39,850
You've had some conversations about your
role in academia and that you might not 

3366
02:47:41,330 --> 02:47:44,540
necessarily be unstructured academia 
forever,

3367
02:47:44,541 --> 02:47:47,600
that this might be an issue like that.

3368
02:47:47,600 --> 02:47:50,600
This is coming to a head.
You feel that way now?

3369
02:47:50,750 --> 02:47:51,950
Well,
the university,

3370
02:47:52,040 --> 02:47:57,040
I think what happened was the university
reacted towards me because a bunch of 

3371
02:47:57,531 --> 02:48:02,531
people got irritated and organized and 
you know when they're irritated way and 

3372
02:48:02,531 --> 02:48:07,121
said that I was a bad person and 
something should be done about me and 

3373
02:48:07,121 --> 02:48:10,481
there was enough of them so the 
university thought they needed to react 

3374
02:48:10,481 --> 02:48:13,781
to that pressure.
That's a charitable way of interpreting 

3375
02:48:13,781 --> 02:48:17,741
it but reasonable.
But then a bunch of people wrote the 

3376
02:48:17,741 --> 02:48:18,350
university and said,
wait a second,

3377
02:48:18,650 --> 02:48:22,430
I agree with what that guy's doing.
You should leave them alone and not only

3378
02:48:22,970 --> 02:48:27,970
people from the general populace,
but soon after I posted the original 

3379
02:48:27,970 --> 02:48:31,721
videos,
like the press was kind of a bivalent 

3380
02:48:31,721 --> 02:48:33,240
about me for awhile in,
in the first two weeks or three weeks,

3381
02:48:33,241 --> 02:48:38,241
say,
after I released those videos and there 

3382
02:48:38,241 --> 02:48:40,001
were the protests,
but then they started to look into what 

3383
02:48:40,001 --> 02:48:40,001
I was doing and they thought,
oh,

3384
02:48:40,001 --> 02:48:40,001
it turns out that,
you know,

3385
02:48:40,520 --> 02:48:44,240
freedom of speech actually happens to be
quite important to journalists to.

3386
02:48:44,520 --> 02:48:49,310
And they came out like really radically 
in support of me,

3387
02:48:49,311 --> 02:48:52,000
some of the major journalists in Canada 
and a whole,

3388
02:48:52,070 --> 02:48:57,070
the whole post media system,
which was about a hundred and 50 or 200 

3389
02:48:57,070 --> 02:49:00,851
newspapers.
And so the university had a reason to 

3390
02:49:00,851 --> 02:49:03,230
back off and maybe they were happy to 
back off.

3391
02:49:03,231 --> 02:49:05,300
I mean,
the Dean I was negotiating was,

3392
02:49:05,360 --> 02:49:06,830
you know,
he wasn't a bad guy.

3393
02:49:07,260 --> 02:49:12,260
He was an older guy.
I think he's in his seventies and 

3394
02:49:12,260 --> 02:49:12,480
responding to pressure.
He didn't want a bunch of trouble and,

3395
02:49:13,360 --> 02:49:17,200
and he wanted the problem to go away 
right now.

3396
02:49:17,220 --> 02:49:19,770
And that's what you do want for problems
to do.

3397
02:49:19,771 --> 02:49:24,771
But anyways,
all this public support I got gave the 

3398
02:49:24,771 --> 02:49:26,100
university a reason to leave me the hell
alone,

3399
02:49:26,101 --> 02:49:31,101
so they decided to do that and partly I 
suppose I was always reasonable during 

3400
02:49:31,101 --> 02:49:33,570
the negotiations because I'm a 
reasonable person and so,

3401
02:49:34,340 --> 02:49:39,340
you know,
when they met me they realized that I 

3402
02:49:39,340 --> 02:49:40,230
wasn't the particular kind of monster 
that I had been accused of being.

3403
02:49:41,020 --> 02:49:44,670
And so the university has left me off 
and then so I was,

3404
02:49:44,730 --> 02:49:49,730
I had a health crisis in December that 
more or less rectified itself by the 

3405
02:49:50,970 --> 02:49:55,970
beginning of January,
but I wasn't sure that plus what had 

3406
02:49:55,970 --> 02:49:57,480
happened to me because of these videos 
and all the crazy response to them.

3407
02:49:57,800 --> 02:50:02,800
Um,
I wasn't sure I was in a sufficiently 

3408
02:50:02,800 --> 02:50:04,380
together position to go back lecturing 
in January.

3409
02:50:04,500 --> 02:50:07,380
I didn't even know for a while until 
December if I was going to be,

3410
02:50:07,470 --> 02:50:09,600
let's say,
allowed to continue to lecture.

3411
02:50:09,690 --> 02:50:14,690
So it's very uncertain.
But I decided that it was better to get 

3412
02:50:14,690 --> 02:50:16,080
back on the horse,
so to speak.

3413
02:50:16,320 --> 02:50:20,370
And so I started lecturing and the 
students were very welcoming.

3414
02:50:20,910 --> 02:50:25,910
So thank God for that.
What is it like now when you're in 

3415
02:50:25,910 --> 02:50:28,461
school,
is that a completely different 

3416
02:50:28,461 --> 02:50:28,461
experience and before your notoriety 
exploded?

3417
02:50:29,430 --> 02:50:34,430
Well,
there's lots of things that are 

3418
02:50:34,430 --> 02:50:34,430
different about it.

3419
02:50:34,430 --> 02:50:34,430
I mean,
this,

3420
02:50:34,430 --> 02:50:37,940
lots of students,
there are lots of people who come to my 

3421
02:50:37,940 --> 02:50:40,371
classes just to sit in the classes.
There's people who are stopping me all 

3422
02:50:40,371 --> 02:50:44,241
the time in the hallways and wanting to 
introduce themselves and that happens a 

3423
02:50:44,241 --> 02:50:45,310
lot in public and in the strangest 
situation.

3424
02:50:45,311 --> 02:50:48,080
So I'm rather unused to that.
Um,

3425
02:50:49,020 --> 02:50:50,730
the feeling at the university.
Well,

3426
02:50:51,210 --> 02:50:56,210
I haven't processed any of that yet.
I mean I would say I'm about seven 

3427
02:50:56,210 --> 02:50:57,720
months behind in my understanding of my 
own life.

3428
02:50:58,190 --> 02:50:59,940
No,
because things happen.

3429
02:50:59,941 --> 02:51:04,941
So many things happened from September 
to now that I haven't had time to think 

3430
02:51:06,391 --> 02:51:07,840
about any of them,
you know,

3431
02:51:07,850 --> 02:51:10,590
it's just,
and it's been a continual,

3432
02:51:11,220 --> 02:51:15,660
an absolutely continual,
um,

3433
02:51:15,900 --> 02:51:20,900
treadmill of trying to keep up with the 
requests for speaking and the email.

3434
02:51:23,131 --> 02:51:23,660
And,
and I'm,

3435
02:51:23,770 --> 02:51:28,770
I'm supposed to be making these youtube 
videos because I have people who are 

3436
02:51:28,770 --> 02:51:28,770
supporting me for doing that.

3437
02:51:28,770 --> 02:51:33,140
So I'm trying to keep that up.
And then I'm trying to go speak when 

3438
02:51:33,140 --> 02:51:36,981
people invite me,
but not all the time because of course 

3439
02:51:36,981 --> 02:51:38,220
that's a lot of travel and so I'm trying
to recalibrate my life.

3440
02:51:38,221 --> 02:51:39,240
I'm trying to figure out,
okay,

3441
02:51:39,241 --> 02:51:44,241
I've got 10 million views on youtube.
Well what am I supposed to do with that 

3442
02:51:44,241 --> 02:51:45,990
piece of information?
I've got 250,000

3443
02:51:46,770 --> 02:51:49,320
subscribers.
So what is,

3444
02:51:49,470 --> 02:51:50,810
what does that mean?
What,

3445
02:51:50,930 --> 02:51:52,440
what does that mean for what I should be
doing?

3446
02:51:52,441 --> 02:51:55,140
Maybe I should be doing nothing but 
making youtube videos for them.

3447
02:51:55,560 --> 02:51:57,700
I don't know.
It's a tremendous violence.

3448
02:51:57,870 --> 02:51:59,560
It's unbelievable.
It's like it's,

3449
02:51:59,700 --> 02:52:01,230
it's unparalleled.
Yeah.

3450
02:52:01,231 --> 02:52:06,231
Just,
I mean think about it from in terms of 

3451
02:52:06,231 --> 02:52:06,231
is there any other academic that has 
ever

3452
02:52:06,231 --> 02:52:09,760
done anything remotely like that where 
you have 250,000

3453
02:52:09,761 --> 02:52:14,761
subscribers on youtube in a relatively 
short amount of time and then millions 

3454
02:52:15,070 --> 02:52:15,540
and millions of views on your video?

3455
02:52:15,730 --> 02:52:16,540
I know,
I don't know.

3456
02:52:16,890 --> 02:52:19,750
I mean well it's ill defined territory,
right?

3457
02:52:19,751 --> 02:52:23,540
Because who knows what youtube is.
I mean your,

3458
02:52:23,650 --> 02:52:28,650
your presence.
I don't know what you make of your 

3459
02:52:28,650 --> 02:52:28,650
presence.
I mean,

3460
02:52:28,650 --> 02:52:32,410
you told me,
I think that you're getting something 

3461
02:52:32,410 --> 02:52:33,340
like 70 million downloads a month.
It's more than like 120 now.

3462
02:52:33,400 --> 02:52:38,400
Okay.
So you're getting a billion downloads a 

3463
02:52:38,400 --> 02:52:38,510
year,
something like that.

3464
02:52:38,930 --> 02:52:40,260
More than that.
So what?

3465
02:52:41,660 --> 02:52:42,200
Right.
Yeah.

3466
02:52:42,360 --> 02:52:43,970
So what the hell.
So I could ask you,

3467
02:52:43,971 --> 02:52:46,170
what do you make of that?
Like are you the,

3468
02:52:46,180 --> 02:52:51,180
are you the,
are you the most powerful interview or 

3469
02:52:51,180 --> 02:52:53,771
on the planet or are you the most 
powerful interview that the planet has 

3470
02:52:53,771 --> 02:52:54,830
ever seen because it.
Well,

3471
02:52:55,490 --> 02:53:00,230
the numbers would suggest so nobody's 
had who has a billion of anything.

3472
02:53:01,610 --> 02:53:02,150
No one,

3473
02:53:03,240 --> 02:53:04,510
you know,
it's never happened.

3474
02:53:05,230 --> 02:53:10,230
So what the hell?
So what are you doing and why is it 

3475
02:53:10,230 --> 02:53:10,230
working and where are all these people?

3476
02:53:10,230 --> 02:53:10,950
God.
Well,

3477
02:53:10,951 --> 02:53:13,980
what I do is just keep doing it.
That's all I do.

3478
02:53:14,160 --> 02:53:16,860
I just do what I do and I don't think 
too much about it.

3479
02:53:16,950 --> 02:53:21,950
I enjoy it.
I try to talk to people like yourself 

3480
02:53:21,950 --> 02:53:24,141
that I really enjoy talking to.
Or the guy before you was a bow hunter,

3481
02:53:25,110 --> 02:53:27,420
which I enjoy talking to him two very 
different.

3482
02:53:27,421 --> 02:53:28,890
Very,
very different conversation.

3483
02:53:29,220 --> 02:53:33,710
Tomorrow I'm talking about a guy who's a
debunker or talking to a guy who's a.

3484
02:53:33,810 --> 02:53:38,810
He runs a site called metabolic.
We're going to talk about people that 

3485
02:53:38,810 --> 02:53:39,470
believe the earth is flat.
Literally,

3486
02:53:39,530 --> 02:53:44,530
we're going to spend about two hours 
debunking the flat earth theory that is 

3487
02:53:44,560 --> 02:53:49,560
all over the Internet.
I don't know if you realize I've seen 

3488
02:53:49,560 --> 02:53:52,220
it.
There is a rabid anti intellectual vibe 

3489
02:53:53,700 --> 02:53:57,110
that's going on today and this is flat.

3490
02:53:57,900 --> 02:54:02,900
No wonder you know,
it's no wonder because the many of the 

3491
02:54:02,900 --> 02:54:05,280
prominent intellectual types have become
prisoners of their own imagination.

3492
02:54:06,060 --> 02:54:07,060
You know,
it's.

3493
02:54:07,290 --> 02:54:10,780
This is partly what breeds that.
That terror of intellectual ism.

3494
02:54:11,060 --> 02:54:16,060
There's something,
there's something about it that's we 

3495
02:54:16,060 --> 02:54:17,100
don't want to get too far away from our 
bodies.

3496
02:54:18,060 --> 02:54:20,040
We don't want to get too far away from 
her souls.

3497
02:54:20,041 --> 02:54:22,070
That's another way of thinking about it 
and you know,

3498
02:54:22,071 --> 02:54:27,071
there,
there is this idea that as I said 

3499
02:54:27,071 --> 02:54:29,721
before,
that the Catholics always warned about 

3500
02:54:29,721 --> 02:54:32,481
is that the rational mind falls in love 
with its own productions or even more 

3501
02:54:32,481 --> 02:54:35,781
that it tries to elevate its productions
to the status of God and that's,

3502
02:54:35,881 --> 02:54:40,881
I mean,
that's really what Milton was warning 

3503
02:54:40,881 --> 02:54:40,881
about,
at least in some sense in his book,

3504
02:54:40,881 --> 02:54:41,900
Paradise lost.
You know,

3505
02:54:42,000 --> 02:54:45,900
these utopias are human creations and 
then people fall prey to them.

3506
02:54:45,901 --> 02:54:50,070
It's like idol worship really is very 
much like idol worship and,

3507
02:54:50,110 --> 02:54:55,110
and it's no wonder people get skeptical 
of the intellectuals because they're 

3508
02:54:55,110 --> 02:54:58,830
producing these utopias that are fake 
that they inhabit.

3509
02:54:58,831 --> 02:55:02,130
They're almost like the abstract 
equivalent of video games.

3510
02:55:02,720 --> 02:55:04,040
You soul.
I

3511
02:55:04,040 --> 02:55:09,040
think you're right about that,
but I also think there's something else 

3512
02:55:09,040 --> 02:55:11,171
going on.
I think people are aware of this chaos 

3513
02:55:11,171 --> 02:55:14,861
that we described earlier and they're 
terrified and they're cleaning to 

3514
02:55:14,861 --> 02:55:17,981
nonsense because of that terror and 
they're embedding themselves in these 

3515
02:55:18,201 --> 02:55:20,240
fruitless pursuits,
chasing their own tail.

3516
02:55:20,300 --> 02:55:20,850
Hey,
I'm,

3517
02:55:20,851 --> 02:55:23,720
I'm on board with that man that chasing 
your own tail.

3518
02:55:23,870 --> 02:55:28,870
That's a symbol of chaos.
Chaos is the dragon that eats its own 

3519
02:55:28,870 --> 02:55:32,591
tail,
so that came spontaneously to mind when 

3520
02:55:32,591 --> 02:55:33,800
you thought about that,
because it's a downward spiral man.

3521
02:55:34,420 --> 02:55:36,530
Yeah,
and the thing is is that as you,

3522
02:55:36,710 --> 02:55:39,830
as you retreat from the chaos into your 
own little prison,

3523
02:55:40,280 --> 02:55:45,280
you get weaker and weaker and the prison
gets smaller and smaller and the chaos 

3524
02:55:45,280 --> 02:55:48,761
gets bigger and bigger.
It's really an ugly pathway and you get 

3525
02:55:48,761 --> 02:55:52,241
more and more bitter and resentful and 
much more afraid of having your prison 

3526
02:55:52,241 --> 02:55:52,241
walls breached.

3527
02:55:52,370 --> 02:55:57,370
It's a downward spiral and much less 
interested in pursuing the truth or any 

3528
02:55:57,621 --> 02:56:02,621
sort of objective reasoning and much 
more interested in confirmation bias to 

3529
02:56:04,281 --> 02:56:05,270
the extreme.
That's right.

3530
02:56:05,450 --> 02:56:10,450
That's exactly what happens.
I detailed out that process in my book 

3531
02:56:10,450 --> 02:56:13,920
maps of meaning exactly that it's this 
feedback loop pay because you,

3532
02:56:14,320 --> 02:56:17,330
the weaker you are,
the thicker the walls have to be,

3533
02:56:17,600 --> 02:56:22,600
but the thick you make the walls,
the less challenge you face in the 

3534
02:56:22,600 --> 02:56:27,071
weaker you get,
so then the walls have to get thicker 

3535
02:56:27,071 --> 02:56:29,231
and then you get weaker and the walls 
have to get thicker and it's not a 

3536
02:56:29,231 --> 02:56:29,630
pretty.
It's not a pretty picture man.

3537
02:56:30,800 --> 02:56:33,700
So.
Hmm.

3538
02:56:34,310 --> 02:56:35,570
Yeah,
that's what I think too.

3539
02:56:35,930 --> 02:56:37,490
Yeah.
Because.

3540
02:56:37,520 --> 02:56:42,110
And on that note we just to three hours,
we just did it.

3541
02:56:42,300 --> 02:56:43,970
This is my favorite podcasts of all 
time.

3542
02:56:44,240 --> 02:56:45,320
Oh,
I just want to tell Ya.

3543
02:56:45,530 --> 02:56:46,880
Well thank you.
Thank you.

3544
02:56:47,030 --> 02:56:49,670
It was awesome.
I could I say it was my favorite podcast

3545
02:56:49,671 --> 02:56:54,671
of all time.
I have a much smaller domain of podcast 

3546
02:56:54,671 --> 02:56:55,520
comparisons.
So we did.

3547
02:56:55,960 --> 02:56:58,130
This is like number 900 and what,
what is it?

3548
02:56:59,300 --> 02:57:04,300
Nine hundred 58.
I think you touched on some things that 

3549
02:57:04,300 --> 02:57:06,560
made me think in a very unique way 
today,

3550
02:57:06,950 --> 02:57:09,260
so thank you very much for that.
I'm going to listen to this one a couple

3551
02:57:09,261 --> 02:57:14,261
of times.
So thank you very much both for both 

3552
02:57:14,261 --> 02:57:16,931
occasions.
I mean you provided a tremendous boost 

3553
02:57:16,931 --> 02:57:19,601
to my presence,
so whatever comes of that is to be 

3554
02:57:19,601 --> 02:57:21,180
blamed partly on you.
Alrighty.

3555
02:57:21,640 --> 02:57:22,570
All right.
Thanks brother.

3556
02:57:22,610 --> 02:57:23,720
You Bet.
Really appreciate it.

3557
02:57:23,740 --> 02:57:24,220
Good.
Yep.

3558
02:57:24,400 --> 02:57:25,790
Thank you Jordan Peterson.
Ladies,

3559
02:57:25,791 --> 02:57:26,930
gentlemen,
Cmr.
