1
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:03,870
Four three,

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:04,793
two,

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:05,723
one,

4
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:06,930
ladies and gentlemen.

5
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:07,920
Jeff Novitsky.

6
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:08,790
How are you buddy?

7
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:09,391
What's up Joelle?

8
00:00:09,391 --> 00:00:09,990
Doing good.

9
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:10,920
I have to ask you,

10
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,920
do you mind the nickname
the golden snitch?

11
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:15,360
So first thing I was gonna bring up

12
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:18,600
this golden snitch bullshit.

13
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:20,701
I just want to say,

14
00:00:20,701 --> 00:00:22,050
it's not my nickname.

15
00:00:22,051 --> 00:00:23,250
It's Brennan jobs.

16
00:00:23,251 --> 00:00:25,230
He came up with it 100% on his own.

17
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,313
He was going to ask you.

18
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:27,443
It's all good though.

19
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:28,201
It's good.

20
00:00:28,201 --> 00:00:29,034
It's all good.

21
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,870
So a couple of funny stories about that.

22
00:00:30,871 --> 00:00:32,850
So when did he come up with this?

23
00:00:32,851 --> 00:00:34,380
About a year ago at least.

24
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:35,280
So,

25
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,650
so people in the office
started coming up to me saying,

26
00:00:37,651 --> 00:00:37,891
hey,

27
00:00:37,891 --> 00:00:38,724
golden snitch,

28
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:40,620
what the hell's that?

29
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:42,820
Do a little research as she,

30
00:00:42,821 --> 00:00:45,480
something about Harry Potter
or some character named there.

31
00:00:45,481 --> 00:00:45,721
I'm like,

32
00:00:45,721 --> 00:00:47,130
what the hell does this
have to do with me?

33
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,860
So about a month ago,

34
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,000
somebody lets me know,

35
00:00:51,001 --> 00:00:51,241
hey,

36
00:00:51,241 --> 00:00:52,470
checkout Wikipedia.

37
00:00:52,471 --> 00:00:56,130
So for whatever reason there's
a Jeff Novitsky Wiki pdf page.

38
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,710
You go to that page now it's so says,

39
00:00:58,711 --> 00:00:59,700
actually my formal name,

40
00:00:59,701 --> 00:01:00,750
Jeffrey John Novitsky,

41
00:01:00,751 --> 00:01:02,310
Aka the golden snitch.

42
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,580
So last week,

43
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,170
Donna Marceline,

44
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:07,471
you know,

45
00:01:07,471 --> 00:01:08,210
Donna,

46
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:08,970
um,

47
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:13,410
long 15 year employee of the UFC now
works with me and talk about her little

48
00:01:13,411 --> 00:01:13,651
later.

49
00:01:13,651 --> 00:01:15,060
It's a great asset to what we're doing.

50
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:16,710
She sends me a text,

51
00:01:16,711 --> 00:01:17,041
she says,

52
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:17,874
check this out.

53
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,080
So she's got one of those Amazon Echos.

54
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:22,100
Um,

55
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:22,890
Alexa,

56
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:23,371
I think so.

57
00:01:23,371 --> 00:01:24,151
She says Alexa,

58
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:27,000
who's Jeff Novitsky and
Alexis name says Jeffery.

59
00:01:27,001 --> 00:01:29,790
John Novitsky Aka the golden snitch.

60
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:33,570
So thanks a lot.

61
00:01:33,571 --> 00:01:34,404
Shop.

62
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:34,660
Oh,

63
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:35,141
shove.

64
00:01:35,141 --> 00:01:35,974
What have you done?

65
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:36,831
That's hilarious.

66
00:01:36,831 --> 00:01:37,471
I love Donna.

67
00:01:37,471 --> 00:01:38,304
She's amazing.

68
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:39,361
She's awesome.

69
00:01:39,361 --> 00:01:40,500
So she's over there.

70
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,220
Yeah,

71
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:41,521
I mean,

72
00:01:41,521 --> 00:01:43,140
you know about kind of her history.

73
00:01:43,141 --> 00:01:47,130
She was more of the five original ploys
of the UFC was Dana as assistant to

74
00:01:47,131 --> 00:01:47,964
start out with,

75
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:48,721
uh,

76
00:01:48,721 --> 00:01:51,120
went on to become VP of event operations.

77
00:01:51,121 --> 00:01:52,140
So basically,

78
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:52,981
you know,

79
00:01:52,981 --> 00:01:56,430
she got everybody to the event
set up hotel at the event,

80
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,713
ran the crew,

81
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:57,931
you know,

82
00:01:57,931 --> 00:02:00,330
the blue shirts backstage
that run the event.

83
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:01,590
Um,

84
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:01,741
you know,

85
00:02:01,741 --> 00:02:03,450
I think after doing it for many years,

86
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,490
she got a little burnt out on it.

87
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,200
So when to Dana,

88
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:07,610
uh,

89
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:08,640
mid summer and says,

90
00:02:08,641 --> 00:02:08,851
look,

91
00:02:08,851 --> 00:02:10,980
I don't think I want to do this anymore,

92
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:15,420
but I'd really love to do something else
and I've seen kind of what Jeff's doing

93
00:02:15,421 --> 00:02:16,051
in his program.

94
00:02:16,051 --> 00:02:19,320
I really like to go over there and
work with him and kind of learn,

95
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:19,920
you know,

96
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,820
what he's doing.

97
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,760
And so Dana pulled me
into the office and said,

98
00:02:23,761 --> 00:02:24,100
Hey,

99
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,380
what do you think about this idea?

100
00:02:25,381 --> 00:02:29,070
And it took me literally a half
second to say 100% on board.

101
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,391
This woman,

102
00:02:30,391 --> 00:02:30,571
I mean,

103
00:02:30,571 --> 00:02:31,410
as you probably know,

104
00:02:31,411 --> 00:02:35,670
is about as attention to detail and
passionate about her work as anybody.

105
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,550
And really my positioning,

106
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,590
unlike the name,

107
00:02:40,591 --> 00:02:41,550
the Golden Snitch,

108
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,420
is an advocate to our athletes to make
sure our athletes are successful under

109
00:02:45,421 --> 00:02:45,991
the program.

110
00:02:45,991 --> 00:02:47,610
Not that they fail under the program.

111
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,960
It's definitely the wrong nickname.

112
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:49,800
It's just catchy.

113
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,390
It is just unfortunately catchy.

114
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:51,751
Again,

115
00:02:51,751 --> 00:02:52,021
I'm all,

116
00:02:52,021 --> 00:02:52,890
I'm all good with it.

117
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,213
I back.

118
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:54,661
But,

119
00:02:54,661 --> 00:02:54,960
uh,

120
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,380
the real golden snitches,

121
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,300
Victor Conti,

122
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:58,830
he's the Golden Snitch,

123
00:02:58,870 --> 00:02:59,230
right?

124
00:02:59,230 --> 00:02:59,461
Yeah.

125
00:02:59,461 --> 00:02:59,760
I mean,

126
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,593
I was actually,

127
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:04,150
I can see that because he was a
guy who was giving guys steroids.

128
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,070
You were a guy that was
always catching people.

129
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:06,401
Correct.

130
00:03:06,401 --> 00:03:07,660
So it's the wrong moniker.

131
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:08,380
Correct.

132
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,650
Giving them steroids and
then talking about it after,

133
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:11,290
right?

134
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:12,040
Yeah.

135
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:12,940
That's a snitch.

136
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,080
That's the golden stitch.

137
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:14,973
Not you man,

138
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:15,671
but it's all good.

139
00:03:15,671 --> 00:03:16,640
I was hoping shop with him,

140
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,063
call him.

141
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,560
I'm up later in this show what
I could do anything to them,

142
00:03:20,561 --> 00:03:22,240
but it'd be interesting to
look at him in the face.

143
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,501
He would say,

144
00:03:23,501 --> 00:03:24,760
I'm sorry Bro.

145
00:03:24,761 --> 00:03:25,594
Sorry.

146
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:26,261
Yeah.

147
00:03:26,261 --> 00:03:26,830
Well anyway,

148
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:27,610
back to Donna.

149
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:28,450
She's awesome.

150
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:28,631
Um,

151
00:03:28,631 --> 00:03:30,190
so I'm super psyched that she's with you.

152
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,320
So what exactly does she do for you guys?

153
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:33,610
Again her,

154
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:34,000
you know,

155
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,440
when I sat her down in the summer I said,

156
00:03:35,441 --> 00:03:35,681
look,

157
00:03:35,681 --> 00:03:39,310
your role here is going to make sure that
the athletes are successful under the

158
00:03:39,311 --> 00:03:39,890
program.

159
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:41,510
And in a program like this,

160
00:03:41,511 --> 00:03:43,360
there are so many landmines,

161
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:43,991
you know,

162
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:47,770
whether it be making sure your
whereabouts filing is that Tom is on time,

163
00:03:47,771 --> 00:03:48,670
making sure you sought a,

164
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:52,090
knows where you're at so they can come
do a collection from you at any time.

165
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:53,080
Uh,

166
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,750
making sure you make
safe supplement choices,

167
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,170
making sure the medications
you're taking are correct.

168
00:03:59,171 --> 00:03:59,860
So she,

169
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:00,101
you know,

170
00:04:00,101 --> 00:04:01,310
works hard for all those things.

171
00:04:01,311 --> 00:04:05,440
I give you the prime example of
what she brings to this program.

172
00:04:05,441 --> 00:04:07,150
So every three months,

173
00:04:07,151 --> 00:04:07,984
every quarter,

174
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:13,060
every single athlete on the roster is
required to file what's called quarterly.

175
00:04:13,061 --> 00:04:13,870
Whereabouts.

176
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:14,980
Can I pause right here?

177
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:15,251
It does.

178
00:04:15,251 --> 00:04:18,820
Just so this can be a standalone if
people don't know exactly what you do.

179
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:19,683
Sure.

180
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:25,710
Jeff is in charge of making sure that all
the UFC athletes are clean and free of

181
00:04:27,941 --> 00:04:29,800
performance enhancing substances.

182
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,520
And it was a huge issue
before you came along.

183
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,110
A huge issue in the sport.

184
00:04:35,111 --> 00:04:35,371
And,

185
00:04:35,371 --> 00:04:37,630
and continues to be in
other organizations,

186
00:04:37,631 --> 00:04:38,800
particularly overseas.

187
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,820
I mean there's just ramping speculation
about companies that literally encourage

188
00:04:42,821 --> 00:04:44,290
people to take steroids.

189
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:48,250
It was always the case
with pride in Japan.

190
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:51,660
That was one of the big things
about pride ensin anyway,

191
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:55,810
who fought for them many times came on
the podcast and literally was saying in

192
00:04:55,811 --> 00:04:57,490
the contract and like capital letters,

193
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,160
it says we will not test you for steroids.

194
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:01,990
Like they wanted everybody
to take steroids.

195
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,530
They,

196
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,300
I had friends who went
to fight over there.

197
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:07,210
They told him to take steroids
and move up a weight class.

198
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:12,880
So it was always an issue in the sport
that this was a dirty sport air quotes.

199
00:05:12,881 --> 00:05:13,360
Right.

200
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:13,660
Yeah.

201
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,050
Um,

202
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:18,970
but since you've come along and since
you guys started instituting this

203
00:05:18,971 --> 00:05:20,200
incredibly strict testing,

204
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:21,970
we've seen some pretty radical changes.

205
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:25,090
We've seen some amazing fights and
amazing performances and I don't think the

206
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:26,200
performance levels dropped.

207
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:26,591
In fact,

208
00:05:26,591 --> 00:05:28,810
I think it escalated and elevated rather,

209
00:05:28,811 --> 00:05:30,820
which is something that people
were really concerned about.

210
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:35,560
But one thing that we did see is some
people that you suspected of doing stuff,

211
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,480
their bodies radically changed.

212
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,680
It was really mean.

213
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:42,370
That became a meme pre
Usada and post Usada I mean,

214
00:05:42,371 --> 00:05:44,650
and there's some comedy memes
out there because of it,

215
00:05:44,651 --> 00:05:47,680
because people's bodies
change so radically.

216
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:48,221
Yeah,

217
00:05:48,221 --> 00:05:48,821
it's interesting.

218
00:05:48,821 --> 00:05:49,210
You know,

219
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:50,380
the last time I was on,

220
00:05:50,381 --> 00:05:52,320
we talked about kind of the smell test,

221
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,530
looking at somebody and you know,

222
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:57,410
it's difficult to say
definitively whether or not,

223
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:57,741
you know,

224
00:05:57,741 --> 00:05:58,190
changes

225
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,630
in bodies are due to that or not,

226
00:05:59,631 --> 00:06:00,081
but you know,

227
00:06:00,081 --> 00:06:03,640
you can't help but look at some of these
pictures before and after you saw it.

228
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:04,700
And I think that's the case.

229
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,380
That's something I always struggle with.

230
00:06:06,381 --> 00:06:09,050
How do you judge the success of a program?

231
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:10,340
Um,

232
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,030
you know,

233
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:13,460
do you judge it on
numbers of positive tests?

234
00:06:13,461 --> 00:06:15,530
I don't think that's necessarily the case.

235
00:06:15,531 --> 00:06:15,771
You know,

236
00:06:15,771 --> 00:06:16,604
maybe,

237
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,200
maybe you're not catching everybody.

238
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:20,030
Maybe there's no one to catch.

239
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:20,990
Um,

240
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:23,120
do you judge it on before
and after pictures?

241
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:23,580
I don't know.

242
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,050
I mean that,

243
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,820
that could be one factor.

244
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,520
I like to judge it a lot anecdotally.

245
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:29,061
You know,

246
00:06:29,061 --> 00:06:33,710
a big part of my job is getting out
and building relationships with our

247
00:06:33,711 --> 00:06:34,544
fighters,

248
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,050
with managers,

249
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,370
with coaches,

250
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,450
and just,

251
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:38,660
you know,

252
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:42,110
chewing on their ear and figuring out
what they're seeing and what they're

253
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:42,561
hearing.

254
00:06:42,561 --> 00:06:44,060
And almost universally,

255
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,690
the feedback I get from,

256
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,290
from them is this is
making a big difference.

257
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:49,520
Um,

258
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:49,731
you know,

259
00:06:49,731 --> 00:06:51,260
one thing I brought with me today,

260
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:55,520
and really the coolest piece of data
I think I've seen in any anti-doping

261
00:06:55,521 --> 00:07:00,521
program are some really
objective measurable statistics
and the UFC anti-doping

262
00:07:01,581 --> 00:07:06,080
program Usada so you saw it as the
United States antidoping agency.

263
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:10,070
They're the official antidoping agency
of the United States by an act of

264
00:07:10,071 --> 00:07:10,904
Congress.

265
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,660
They're in charge of all drug
testing for us Olympic sports.

266
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:15,620
Uh,

267
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:20,620
back in 2015 we made the
decision to outsource the
administration of our program

268
00:07:21,951 --> 00:07:22,790
to Usada.

269
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:26,180
The primary reason being
the independence factor.

270
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:26,751
Um,

271
00:07:26,751 --> 00:07:26,961
you know,

272
00:07:26,961 --> 00:07:29,270
when you look at all these other
professional sports league,

273
00:07:29,271 --> 00:07:29,950
some have,

274
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:30,230
you know,

275
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:34,040
better programs and other none
really have any independence in the

276
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:34,730
administration.

277
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:35,331
That program.

278
00:07:35,331 --> 00:07:38,990
And with that means is there's
no way of telling whether or not,

279
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:39,980
um,

280
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:40,191
you know,

281
00:07:40,191 --> 00:07:41,420
when an athlete is sanctioned,

282
00:07:41,421 --> 00:07:44,510
it's done for business reasons
or done for favoritism.

283
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,190
So in our program,

284
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:46,521
you know,

285
00:07:46,521 --> 00:07:50,120
no one can say that that any of the
administration of our program has done for

286
00:07:50,121 --> 00:07:50,631
that reason.

287
00:07:50,631 --> 00:07:52,790
It's a truly independent authority.

288
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:57,260
So what you saw it did recently as they
went back and they'd been in existence

289
00:07:57,261 --> 00:08:00,470
since I think about 2001
on the US Olympic level.

290
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:05,390
They went back and took a look at every
single doper I think for steroids.

291
00:08:05,391 --> 00:08:09,920
Everyone was caught for steroids in the
existence of the Usada program and took

292
00:08:09,921 --> 00:08:11,840
a look at each of those athletes,

293
00:08:11,841 --> 00:08:16,841
biological passports and
biological markers and they
looked at what was the most

294
00:08:17,181 --> 00:08:20,820
common factor for the
doper versus you know,

295
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,710
the non doper.

296
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:27,280
And what they determined was what stood
out the most was large variance in

297
00:08:27,531 --> 00:08:30,170
testosterone excretion in the urine.

298
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:31,820
And we think about it,

299
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,410
common sense point of view that kind of
makes sense and that someone who's using

300
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,290
steroids at that time presents a sample.

301
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:43,160
Their testosterone excretion is
probably going to be on the higher end.

302
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,850
And if they were to catch
a doper on and off cycle,

303
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,990
what happens when you get off steroids
is your body suppresses production of

304
00:08:50,991 --> 00:08:51,771
testosterone.

305
00:08:51,771 --> 00:08:55,770
So in that case you're going to see
a very low excretion of testosterone.

306
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,650
So they looked at that and
plotted it out and saw hey,

307
00:08:58,651 --> 00:09:02,430
every dope or has a very large
variance and testosterone excretion.

308
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:07,710
Then what they did is they took all the
UFC samples and they plotted amount by

309
00:09:07,711 --> 00:09:10,410
quarter and actually brought
a graph along with me.

310
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,390
And it's some really drastic,

311
00:09:12,391 --> 00:09:12,960
I think,

312
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:17,040
visual evidence of the success
and the impact of this program.

313
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:19,670
I don't know if you can throw
it up mom to take a look at it.

314
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:22,663
Um,

315
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,060
so when,

316
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,410
what year exactly did,

317
00:09:25,411 --> 00:09:25,740
uh,

318
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,060
you saw a takeover?

319
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:27,271
Yeah.

320
00:09:27,271 --> 00:09:27,811
So we can't,

321
00:09:27,811 --> 00:09:28,141
you saw it,

322
00:09:28,141 --> 00:09:33,090
it came into play July of 2015 so if
you saw it has been in existence for two

323
00:09:33,091 --> 00:09:33,421
years.

324
00:09:33,421 --> 00:09:34,440
So you see here,

325
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:35,873
um,

326
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,080
that first quarter,

327
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,850
quarter three of 2015,

328
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,010
a pretty decent variants there.

329
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:41,491
Um,

330
00:09:41,491 --> 00:09:43,410
which means in any given test and athlete,

331
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:43,751
you know,

332
00:09:43,751 --> 00:09:45,240
I was up on an average,

333
00:09:45,241 --> 00:09:46,170
a little bit 30,

334
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,460
I'm a little,

335
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:47,881
you know,

336
00:09:47,881 --> 00:09:48,750
in the mid twenties.

337
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,590
And then look at,

338
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,510
as you plot out that graph,

339
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:52,020
uh,

340
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:56,430
that variance becomes smaller and smaller
and smaller and more in the medium

341
00:09:56,431 --> 00:09:58,140
range as it gets out to,

342
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:58,441
you know,

343
00:09:58,441 --> 00:10:00,120
quarter three of 2017.

344
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,080
That's very interesting.

345
00:10:01,081 --> 00:10:01,650
You don't,

346
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:02,040
you don't,

347
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:02,640
this is,

348
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,650
you don't usually see statistics.

349
00:10:04,651 --> 00:10:09,651
This is the first I've been involved in
anti-doping world since 2002 and I can

350
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,850
unequivocally say that this
is the strongest visual,

351
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,511
objective,

352
00:10:15,511 --> 00:10:18,270
measurable evidence of success
of a program that I've ever seen.

353
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:18,691
Well,

354
00:10:18,691 --> 00:10:20,580
one of the things that's
so fascinating about this,

355
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:21,760
and um,

356
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:22,351
this,

357
00:10:22,351 --> 00:10:23,580
this goes to this,

358
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:27,630
goes to credit to the UFC 100% is that
they decided to do something about this.

359
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:28,643
They didn't have to,

360
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:33,180
it wasn't like someone
coming after them because,

361
00:10:33,181 --> 00:10:33,391
uh,

362
00:10:33,391 --> 00:10:33,721
you know,

363
00:10:33,721 --> 00:10:36,180
so many people had been
caught and someone said,

364
00:10:36,181 --> 00:10:36,421
hey,

365
00:10:36,421 --> 00:10:40,170
we're going to put a program on you
guys to make sure you're not doping.

366
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:41,190
Or the UFC said,

367
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,740
we've got to clean this up and there's,

368
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,770
there's only one way.

369
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:48,210
The one way is to go with the very best
testing possible and the most rigorous,

370
00:10:48,211 --> 00:10:48,600
the most,

371
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,610
I mean checkin everywhere you go,

372
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,500
we're going to give you random tests,

373
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,550
six o'clock in the morning,

374
00:10:53,551 --> 00:10:54,384
knock on your door,

375
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:55,680
like the whole,

376
00:10:55,710 --> 00:11:00,240
the whole full gamut of tests and
the results have been pretty amazing.

377
00:11:00,241 --> 00:11:05,241
And that alones that speaks volumes
when you see this size of the variance

378
00:11:05,281 --> 00:11:06,630
between the,

379
00:11:06,631 --> 00:11:06,751
uh,

380
00:11:06,751 --> 00:11:09,690
the test when you guys first
started versus now definitely,

381
00:11:09,691 --> 00:11:10,250
hey,

382
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,640
it's a credit to two people,

383
00:11:11,641 --> 00:11:16,140
the Renzo for Tita and Dana white that
made that decision and that's a hell of a

384
00:11:16,141 --> 00:11:18,900
risky decision but done
for all the right reasons.

385
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:19,621
You know,

386
00:11:19,621 --> 00:11:24,030
anybody that contends that Dana doesn't
care about his athletes need look no

387
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,290
further than this program.

388
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,340
This program is of tremendous risk to
the company and to the bottom line.

389
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:34,730
When you're test athletes 365 days a year
on announced no predictability of when

390
00:11:35,581 --> 00:11:36,540
the test is coming,

391
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,320
there can be some very severe
consequences to have been there.

392
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:42,570
Several main events there has been,

393
00:11:42,571 --> 00:11:43,350
I mean,

394
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,580
UFC 200,

395
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,180
yeah,

396
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:45,870
the land,

397
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:49,410
arguably the landmark event
in the history of the UFC.

398
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,110
We lose our main event,

399
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:54,520
the before

400
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:59,760
UFC 200 millions if not tens of
millions into the marketing of that.

401
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,080
Um,

402
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,381
you know,

403
00:12:02,381 --> 00:12:07,120
the success of the paper view probably
hinges on that great main event between

404
00:12:07,121 --> 00:12:10,480
John and Daniel and we lost
it three or four days before.

405
00:12:10,481 --> 00:12:11,560
And that could happen.

406
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,433
Didn't you know,

407
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,600
at any given moment.

408
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,880
Now we talked about
this before the podcast,

409
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:16,330
um,

410
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:20,200
what you could or could not talk about
what the current state of John Jones

411
00:12:20,201 --> 00:12:20,891
investigation.

412
00:12:20,891 --> 00:12:22,060
So where's it at right now?

413
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:22,511
Yeah.

414
00:12:22,511 --> 00:12:22,900
So,

415
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:23,111
you know,

416
00:12:23,111 --> 00:12:25,360
generally we don't talk about,

417
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:25,980
uh,

418
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:26,471
the case.

419
00:12:26,471 --> 00:12:26,780
So,

420
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,180
so how the process works.

421
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:31,960
When an athlete test positive
you sought it will notify me.

422
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:32,891
Um,

423
00:12:32,891 --> 00:12:36,640
I usually pick the phone up right away
and call Dana and let him know and the

424
00:12:36,641 --> 00:12:38,140
UFC puts out an announcement.

425
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:38,880
They say,

426
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,100
you know,

427
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,980
in the case of John John tested positive,

428
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:42,430
uh,

429
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:45,070
then in an in competition
test on this date,

430
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,473
um,

431
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,020
you know,

432
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,520
more information will be provided.

433
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,600
At the appropriate time.

434
00:12:49,601 --> 00:12:51,250
That's generally all we'll talk about.

435
00:12:51,251 --> 00:12:52,084
Now.

436
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:54,100
If the athlete chooses to talk about,

437
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:54,880
you know,

438
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,760
scenarios of,

439
00:12:55,761 --> 00:12:56,650
of what happened,

440
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,210
then they're free to do that.

441
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:58,690
Um,

442
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:01,180
at that point you saw it in
the UFC can comment on it.

443
00:13:01,181 --> 00:13:03,610
So there's been some things
talked about in the John Case,

444
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:04,400
uh,

445
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,233
by John.

446
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,393
Um,

447
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:11,430
particularly he had to clean tests on
July 7th and July 8th before his positive

448
00:13:13,241 --> 00:13:14,980
test on I think July 30th,

449
00:13:14,981 --> 00:13:16,210
which was way in day.

450
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:21,520
And the positive test was for to hydro
chloral methyl testosterone or oral

451
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:22,443
Terenna ball.

452
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:23,883
Um,

453
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:27,340
this is a substance that was
used by the East Germans.

454
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:29,470
I'm regularly in the late sixties,

455
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:31,990
and then came into the
fold a little bit more,

456
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:32,531
um,

457
00:13:32,531 --> 00:13:34,630
of what's come out recently
a matter of Russia.

458
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:35,141
So,

459
00:13:35,141 --> 00:13:35,710
um,

460
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,770
I know you had a Bryan Fogel on for,

461
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,900
for the ICARUS moving.

462
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:40,960
I think you talked about
a little bit about this.

463
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,793
Um,

464
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:42,311
uh,

465
00:13:42,311 --> 00:13:42,881
Gregory,

466
00:13:42,881 --> 00:13:44,410
the head of the Moscow,

467
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:48,190
a laboratory that this drug became
kind of part of his protocol,

468
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,091
um,

469
00:13:49,091 --> 00:13:50,200
with his athletes.

470
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,240
He then ironically enough developed a
test for the longterm metabolites of the

471
00:13:55,241 --> 00:13:56,074
drug.

472
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,580
So previous to that,

473
00:13:57,581 --> 00:14:00,940
the detection window of this
drug was a couple of days.

474
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:02,890
So it was a drug that you know,

475
00:14:02,891 --> 00:14:04,480
even if you run a strict program,

476
00:14:04,481 --> 00:14:09,190
an athlete may gamble with taking because
it had a quick clearance time after he

477
00:14:09,191 --> 00:14:13,490
discovered the longterm metabolite test
that changed and went from a detect and

478
00:14:13,491 --> 00:14:17,890
when detection window of a couple of
days to a detection window of several

479
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:18,370
months.

480
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:19,990
And this was widely known,

481
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:20,380
you know,

482
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,460
it wasn't a secret.

483
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:25,570
Initially they kept it quiet and they
went back and retested some samples and

484
00:14:25,571 --> 00:14:30,571
there was a whole bunch of positives and
then it got out 2013 around that there

485
00:14:31,061 --> 00:14:31,821
was this new test.

486
00:14:31,821 --> 00:14:33,760
So right up front,

487
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:34,061
you know,

488
00:14:34,061 --> 00:14:34,251
I've,

489
00:14:34,251 --> 00:14:35,740
I've said this a while now is,

490
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:39,320
would not make a lot of
sense for an individual,

491
00:14:39,321 --> 00:14:41,020
a UFC athlete that new,

492
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,290
you know,

493
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:42,123
especially,

494
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:42,470
you know,

495
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:47,140
a champion contender like Jon Jones at
new and I'm tested quite regularly in

496
00:14:47,141 --> 00:14:47,771
this program,

497
00:14:47,771 --> 00:14:51,740
would not make a lot of sense that
that would be your drug of choice.

498
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:53,660
If you were intentionally trying to cheat,

499
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,213
um,

500
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,920
I think it's come out after the fact that,

501
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:58,430
uh,

502
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:58,930
you saw the,

503
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:03,920
did another test on John a month or two
or a couple months after his positive

504
00:15:03,921 --> 00:15:06,530
tests and he was negative
during that test.

505
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:08,600
So that would be indicative that,

506
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:09,290
you know,

507
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:13,850
the prohibited system entered his system
or the prohibited substance entered his

508
00:15:13,851 --> 00:15:14,684
system,

509
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:14,991
you know,

510
00:15:14,991 --> 00:15:18,620
sometime after July 7th
or eighth and was likely,

511
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:19,071
you know,

512
00:15:19,071 --> 00:15:22,190
a pretty small amount in that it
cleared his system pretty quickly.

513
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,360
Um,

514
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:23,930
again,

515
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:24,141
you know,

516
00:15:24,141 --> 00:15:25,970
who knows where it plays out,

517
00:15:25,971 --> 00:15:28,430
but certainly on the surface
of things I have said,

518
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:29,151
you know,

519
00:15:29,151 --> 00:15:32,150
at this point in the game with
that type of information out there,

520
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,290
um,

521
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:36,170
it wouldn't indicate the intentional use.

522
00:15:36,171 --> 00:15:37,550
Now that could be wrong.

523
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,110
I don't know that definitively.

524
00:15:39,111 --> 00:15:39,340
And,

525
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,910
and we'll see how this plays out.

526
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:41,720
Uh,

527
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,740
right now where the process is as John
and you saw that are working closely,

528
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:46,341
um,

529
00:15:46,341 --> 00:15:48,440
I'm aware that there was a
meeting a week or two ago,

530
00:15:48,441 --> 00:15:49,490
pretty lengthy meeting,

531
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:50,631
which,

532
00:15:50,631 --> 00:15:50,910
uh,

533
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,580
I was told was productive.

534
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:55,190
It wasn't given details
of what productive meant.

535
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:56,300
Um,

536
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,010
but I think that's an
important thing right now.

537
00:15:58,011 --> 00:16:01,880
And that John's falling through with
his to retrace all of his steps between

538
00:16:01,881 --> 00:16:02,170
that,

539
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:02,610
you know,

540
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:07,400
last July 8th positive tests and our
negative tests and the positive test on

541
00:16:07,401 --> 00:16:09,050
July 29th of July 30th.

542
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:10,670
It certainly seems like,

543
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,220
based on what you just said,

544
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,590
that this is something that
was accidentally taken,

545
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,010
but if you can't prove that
something was accidentally taken,

546
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:20,540
like if you can't nail it down,

547
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:21,920
what do you,

548
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,670
what happens there?

549
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:22,881
Yeah,

550
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:23,030
it's,

551
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,200
it's difficult and that's,

552
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:24,441
you know,

553
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:26,450
that's kind of the nightmare
scenario that a lot of,

554
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:26,781
you know,

555
00:16:26,781 --> 00:16:30,740
that an athlete can face in a big roll
of what Donna and I do to prevent that

556
00:16:30,741 --> 00:16:31,341
from happening,

557
00:16:31,341 --> 00:16:36,341
to show them what type of care and
consideration is needed to make sure you

558
00:16:36,561 --> 00:16:38,300
don't get into a scenario like that.

559
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:39,051
You know,

560
00:16:39,051 --> 00:16:40,280
under a program like this,

561
00:16:40,281 --> 00:16:45,230
you have to be careful about everything
that's put into your body and

562
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,093
everything.

563
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:46,941
And,

564
00:16:46,941 --> 00:16:47,181
uh,

565
00:16:47,181 --> 00:16:47,841
if you're not,

566
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:48,670
there can be,

567
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:49,040
you know,

568
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,330
severe consequences.

569
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,590
Um,

570
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:52,281
so yeah,

571
00:16:52,281 --> 00:16:52,550
we'll,

572
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,600
we'll see where this plays out.

573
00:16:53,601 --> 00:16:54,081
I tell you,

574
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:54,831
the one thing that I,

575
00:16:54,831 --> 00:16:56,390
that I can say about this is,

576
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:56,660
you know,

577
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:01,660
this is obviously John's second time I'm
in the program with testing positive.

578
00:17:01,761 --> 00:17:05,480
And in the first time he went
through a pretty lengthy,

579
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:05,931
um,

580
00:17:05,931 --> 00:17:10,760
appeal process and there was
a publicly issued a decision,

581
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:11,211
50,

582
00:17:11,211 --> 00:17:13,820
60 pages that went through
all the evidence that,

583
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:15,440
that the independent,

584
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,790
um,

585
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:17,481
uh,

586
00:17:17,481 --> 00:17:20,360
arbitrators heard and decided on.

587
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:24,230
And what they said definitively
in that case was John,

588
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:26,960
there was no evidence of
John intentionally cheated,

589
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:28,820
however he operated with careless,

590
00:17:28,821 --> 00:17:30,020
reckless disregard.

591
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:30,981
Um,

592
00:17:30,981 --> 00:17:32,990
so we ended up getting
the maximum for that,

593
00:17:32,991 --> 00:17:35,450
for those substances you
tested positive for a year.

594
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,710
And that was for some gas
station Viagara type shit,

595
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:39,470
not well,

596
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:41,660
it was actually a couple
of anti estrogen drugs.

597
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:46,661
But what was shown and what the evidence
pointed to was that he took a pill that

598
00:17:47,721 --> 00:17:51,420
was manufactured from a website by
the name of all American peptide.

599
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,201
Uh,

600
00:17:52,201 --> 00:17:55,740
the pill was reported to be a Cialis pill.

601
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:00,300
So when erectile dysfunction pill
that was tainted with these two drugs.

602
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:00,961
Now,

603
00:18:00,961 --> 00:18:04,500
the problem with the arbitrator said is
if he would have gone to that website

604
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,480
and the arbitrators did and I did,

605
00:18:06,481 --> 00:18:09,030
you would have seen that
that same website offered,

606
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:09,930
you know,

607
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:11,180
tons of performance enhanced,

608
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,230
prohibited performance enhancing drugs.

609
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:15,450
And the website said,

610
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:15,690
you know,

611
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:17,100
not for human consumption,

612
00:18:17,101 --> 00:18:18,840
for research purposes only.

613
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:22,800
So it really was careless
disregard that being said.

614
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:23,370
However,

615
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:23,941
John's,

616
00:18:23,941 --> 00:18:24,181
you know,

617
00:18:24,181 --> 00:18:29,010
second time through the program now
the second sanction this time for,

618
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:29,550
you know,

619
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:32,370
an anabolic type steroid would have,

620
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:32,581
you know,

621
00:18:32,581 --> 00:18:35,520
a starting point potentially
have a four year suspension.

622
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:38,220
That's a starting point that
that could be a starting point,

623
00:18:38,221 --> 00:18:38,491
right?

624
00:18:38,491 --> 00:18:40,080
Unless there are mitigating factors.

625
00:18:40,081 --> 00:18:41,130
Now I don't,

626
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:41,521
you know,

627
00:18:41,521 --> 00:18:42,300
again,

628
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:46,800
the beauty of this program is it's not
the UFC or not me deciding what the

629
00:18:46,801 --> 00:18:47,670
sanctions going to be.

630
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,170
No one can accuse us of,

631
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:49,591
you know,

632
00:18:49,591 --> 00:18:52,950
operating for business purposes
or favoritism or whatever.

633
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,000
Um,

634
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,200
but that being said,

635
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:55,981
you know,

636
00:18:55,981 --> 00:18:58,320
when we put this program
together and figure it out,

637
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:58,591
you know,

638
00:18:58,591 --> 00:19:00,090
what sanctioning would look like.

639
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:03,870
I don't necessarily think that
we put up a four year sanction,

640
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:04,740
uh,

641
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:07,890
for a second term offense when the
first term of fence was shown that that

642
00:19:07,891 --> 00:19:08,940
person didn't cheat,

643
00:19:08,941 --> 00:19:09,631
intentionally,

644
00:19:09,631 --> 00:19:11,580
just operated with careless disregard.

645
00:19:11,581 --> 00:19:13,470
So who makes that distinction then?

646
00:19:13,471 --> 00:19:14,380
You saw the shotgun,

647
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:15,240
makes that distinction.

648
00:19:15,241 --> 00:19:15,810
They,

649
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:16,320
you know,

650
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,030
they have a whole team looking at it.

651
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:21,450
They compare it to other
cases under the Wada,

652
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:21,871
uh,

653
00:19:21,871 --> 00:19:23,070
Olympic type umbrella,

654
00:19:23,071 --> 00:19:24,060
similar cases.

655
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,493
Um,

656
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,340
I will say this,

657
00:19:26,341 --> 00:19:26,700
that,

658
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:26,880
you know,

659
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,400
I think we've had a few over 60,

660
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,120
um,

661
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:34,200
positive adverse events in this case
and those that have been adjudicated.

662
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:38,400
I've been comfortable every time that
they've made a fair and balanced and

663
00:19:38,401 --> 00:19:39,420
reasonable decision.

664
00:19:39,421 --> 00:19:43,680
And that's part of my job is to be the
eyes and ears for athletes to make sure

665
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:47,550
not only is the program being
administered properly and has strength,

666
00:19:47,551 --> 00:19:51,270
but also that they're being treated
fairly and that they have due process.

667
00:19:51,271 --> 00:19:53,550
So I have all the confidence in the world.

668
00:19:53,551 --> 00:19:53,881
However,

669
00:19:53,881 --> 00:19:56,280
this does come out that it
will be the right decision.

670
00:19:56,281 --> 00:20:00,240
The other really cool thing about the
program is the transparency the program.

671
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:01,320
So,

672
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:01,651
you know,

673
00:20:01,651 --> 00:20:02,910
it won't just be me saying this,

674
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:04,350
however it does come out,

675
00:20:04,351 --> 00:20:07,740
whether it goes to arbitration or
whether John and you sought or reach a

676
00:20:07,741 --> 00:20:08,574
settlement,

677
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,390
it'll be well spelled out
about why that sanction,

678
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:12,811
uh,

679
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:13,500
was determined.

680
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,360
Now you say starting point,

681
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:18,090
meaning that it could potentially be more,

682
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:18,721
it could.

683
00:20:18,721 --> 00:20:19,170
So,

684
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:19,560
uh,

685
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,020
when there's something called
aggravating circumstances,

686
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:24,960
so more than just
knowingly taking the drug,

687
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:27,000
taking the drug and lying,

688
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,200
trying to cover it up,

689
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,030
taking multiple drugs,

690
00:20:30,031 --> 00:20:31,410
one trying to hide the other.

691
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:32,101
Yeah,

692
00:20:32,101 --> 00:20:32,431
you could,

693
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:33,420
you could get double,

694
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:34,523
um,

695
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:34,771
uh,

696
00:20:34,771 --> 00:20:35,640
the sanction amount.

697
00:20:35,641 --> 00:20:36,090
So,

698
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:36,600
um,

699
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:36,781
you know,

700
00:20:36,781 --> 00:20:37,591
on a second time,

701
00:20:37,591 --> 00:20:40,650
anabolic steroid for years is
kind of the starting point.

702
00:20:40,651 --> 00:20:42,630
You can go lower for mitigating factors.

703
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,990
You can go higher for aggravating
factors up to eight years.

704
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:47,423
Um,

705
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:48,311
so yeah,

706
00:20:48,311 --> 00:20:50,470
I mean it would have to require something,

707
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:51,250
you know,

708
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,580
really severe degree just to
get to get up that bad high.

709
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,050
Has anybody ever gotten that hit?

710
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,490
Not In the UFC program.

711
00:20:57,491 --> 00:20:57,970
Now,

712
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:00,440
what is the biggest hit that
anyone's ever gotten in the Yoh side?

713
00:21:00,441 --> 00:21:01,960
I think thus far it's two years.

714
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:02,620
And it was that,

715
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,460
um,

716
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,960
I think a few people,

717
00:21:04,961 --> 00:21:05,230
uh,

718
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,270
Chad Mendez comes to mind.

719
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,160
Chad Mendez,

720
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,880
his was some sort of
psoriasis cream or something.

721
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:15,280
His was an insulin growth factor one.

722
00:21:15,281 --> 00:21:16,114
So IGF one.

723
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:19,410
And did he say that it came
from a psoriasis Korean?

724
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:20,410
I think he may have said that.

725
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,470
Yeah.

726
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:23,650
That was never proven or no,

727
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:26,260
I mean there was nothing and you saw it
as reasoning or their announcement of

728
00:21:26,261 --> 00:21:27,910
why it was two years about you know,

729
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,890
any type of mitigating factor coming from,

730
00:21:29,891 --> 00:21:34,510
cause I know he your sunrises
and someone had said or had red,

731
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:36,430
I didn't really investigate
very deeply into this,

732
00:21:36,431 --> 00:21:40,120
but I remember reading that he had put
some sort of cream on and then that creem

733
00:21:40,121 --> 00:21:41,920
was responsible for him testing positive.

734
00:21:41,921 --> 00:21:42,520
Was that?

735
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:42,761
Yeah.

736
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:44,260
I don't know that's the case.

737
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:45,520
I do recall him saying that.

738
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:45,971
But you know,

739
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:48,670
hey an athlete can say anything
they wanted about why it happened.

740
00:21:48,671 --> 00:21:50,500
If there was something mitigating,

741
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:53,410
they are afforded that right
to share with Usada that,

742
00:21:53,411 --> 00:21:55,000
look I didn't do this on purpose.

743
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,470
It wasn't on the label,

744
00:21:56,471 --> 00:21:56,831
the cream.

745
00:21:56,831 --> 00:22:00,820
Usually in those instances where the
evidence does show that you will see,

746
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:01,300
you know,

747
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:04,240
a mitigating factor come into play
and a reduction in a sanction.

748
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:04,841
There wasn't any,

749
00:22:04,841 --> 00:22:08,440
in that case it was the two years and
there have been some guys that have gotten

750
00:22:08,441 --> 00:22:09,760
pretty low sentences.

751
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:11,260
Like Tim means is a good example,

752
00:22:11,261 --> 00:22:11,531
right?

753
00:22:11,531 --> 00:22:16,531
Tim Means did take something that was
tainted and you guys or you sought a,

754
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:21,220
got some of those samples from independent
stores found out those were also

755
00:22:21,221 --> 00:22:21,700
tainted.

756
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:21,941
Yeah,

757
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:23,530
Tim means took a supplement.

758
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,383
It was a Kreatin.

759
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:25,780
Um,

760
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,980
and you know,

761
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,240
after he tested positive,

762
00:22:28,241 --> 00:22:28,601
and again,

763
00:22:28,601 --> 00:22:31,930
this is where Donna and I
come into play quite a bit,

764
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,201
you know,

765
00:22:32,201 --> 00:22:33,820
when athletes test positive,

766
00:22:33,821 --> 00:22:35,530
we reach out to them right away saying,

767
00:22:35,531 --> 00:22:36,364
look,

768
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,660
we're here to help you here.

769
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,800
If there's help to be had,

770
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:39,521
uh,

771
00:22:39,521 --> 00:22:40,510
will believe you tell you,

772
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:41,860
give us a reason not to.

773
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:42,940
Um,

774
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:43,900
I did that with Tim.

775
00:22:43,901 --> 00:22:45,910
Tim said I'd never
heard of this substance.

776
00:22:45,911 --> 00:22:46,211
Jeff,

777
00:22:46,211 --> 00:22:46,670
I,

778
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:47,441
you got to believe me.

779
00:22:47,441 --> 00:22:48,274
I didn't take it.

780
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:48,820
Said,

781
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:49,061
all right,

782
00:22:49,061 --> 00:22:50,710
well let's start doing retracing steps.

783
00:22:50,711 --> 00:22:51,970
What have you been taken?

784
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:53,170
Um,

785
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:54,040
he sent me,

786
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:54,700
you know,

787
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,380
maybe a half dozen supplements,

788
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,300
did some research on them,

789
00:22:58,301 --> 00:22:58,750
worked,

790
00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:59,020
uh,

791
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:01,780
reached out to kind of
contacts I still have in the,

792
00:23:01,781 --> 00:23:04,210
in the industry from my law
enforcement days and said,

793
00:23:04,211 --> 00:23:04,450
hey,

794
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:06,550
any of these kind of raise suspicions.

795
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:10,420
And there was one that did buy a company
that made some other kind of sketchy

796
00:23:10,421 --> 00:23:11,254
products.

797
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:11,950
Um,

798
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:15,730
we narrowed in on that one pretty
quickly Senate to Usada too.

799
00:23:15,731 --> 00:23:17,410
A lot of laboratory tested it.

800
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,180
Sure enough it had the substance in it.

801
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:20,290
Um,

802
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:25,000
then what happens is you saw it a will
independently procure some themselves.

803
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,960
So outside of the kind of touch of the
athlete to make sure the athletes not

804
00:23:28,961 --> 00:23:31,390
contaminating with it for Brighton excuse,

805
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:34,720
they were able to get some
that was sealed and not opened.

806
00:23:34,721 --> 00:23:35,620
And sure enough it,

807
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:39,490
it had that substance in it and it had
the same amount of the substance in it

808
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:42,730
that kind of matched up with
how much was in Tim system.

809
00:23:42,731 --> 00:23:44,510
And when he said he had taken it last.

810
00:23:44,511 --> 00:23:47,660
So there's a lot of detective
work that comes into it and I get,

811
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:49,760
I get this question a
lot from fighters saying,

812
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:50,594
hey,

813
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,930
the supplement excuse is
a bullshit excuse that,

814
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,530
you know,

815
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:58,310
there's athletes use and stuff and they
have supplements in their closet that

816
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:00,740
they know are tainted and then boom,

817
00:24:00,741 --> 00:24:01,880
if they test positive,

818
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:03,530
they just have that built in excuse.

819
00:24:03,531 --> 00:24:04,720
And what I tell them is it,

820
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:05,480
it's,

821
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,710
it goes deeper than that.

822
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:10,610
There's literally detect scientific
detective work that's going on from the

823
00:24:10,611 --> 00:24:11,540
Usada side,

824
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,760
making sure everything matches,

825
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,580
making sure they independently
procure the product,

826
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:20,720
making sure what turns up in the Athlete's
system based on when they say they

827
00:24:20,721 --> 00:24:24,620
were taking it matches exactly the
level that's in the product based on,

828
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:25,220
you know,

829
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:27,080
metabolism timings.

830
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,030
So it's much more than that.

831
00:24:29,031 --> 00:24:29,390
And I,

832
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:31,260
I do have a lot of
confidence when you saw it,

833
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:31,581
it says,

834
00:24:31,581 --> 00:24:31,910
Hey,

835
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:33,560
it does match that this is,

836
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:33,831
you know,

837
00:24:33,831 --> 00:24:38,831
came from an unknowingly or unintentional
ingestion that it really is that now

838
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:40,550
in a case like Tim means,

839
00:24:40,551 --> 00:24:42,230
why is he suspended,

840
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:47,440
is if someone does give him a tainted
supplement and he takes it in good faith

841
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:48,940
thinking that it's just creating,

842
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:49,371
right?

843
00:24:49,371 --> 00:24:49,640
So,

844
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:53,030
so there are strict liability
in the program and you know,

845
00:24:53,031 --> 00:24:54,290
they look at all the factors.

846
00:24:54,291 --> 00:24:54,800
So,

847
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,100
you know,

848
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,680
creatine is a relatively low risk product.

849
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,513
However,

850
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:02,840
the Kreatin Tim took was not
third party certified and that,

851
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:03,590
you know,

852
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:04,910
get a lot of questions about,

853
00:25:04,911 --> 00:25:05,181
man,

854
00:25:05,181 --> 00:25:06,950
the supplement industry is dangerous.

855
00:25:06,951 --> 00:25:07,581
And you know,

856
00:25:07,581 --> 00:25:08,450
this sucks for,

857
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,231
for athletes.

858
00:25:09,231 --> 00:25:10,490
There's nothing they can do.

859
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:14,270
There is something that you can do
and it's actually pretty simple to do.

860
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,111
Um,

861
00:25:15,111 --> 00:25:16,310
we were talking earlier about,

862
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:17,363
about on it,

863
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,200
um,

864
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,070
a company you're,

865
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,080
you're involved with and,

866
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:22,910
and you guys third party
certify a lot of your product.

867
00:25:22,911 --> 00:25:27,911
And what that means is you outsource
random testing of the product and sampling

868
00:25:28,461 --> 00:25:29,294
of the product,

869
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:29,780
um,

870
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:33,770
from these independent companies to
make sure they contain no prohibited

871
00:25:33,771 --> 00:25:34,604
substances.

872
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:38,060
And you know what don and
I educate our athletes too,

873
00:25:38,061 --> 00:25:41,570
is you can go to these third
party certification companies.

874
00:25:41,571 --> 00:25:44,840
I think you guys use Catlins group
banned substance control group.

875
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:46,183
There's that group.

876
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:46,760
Um,

877
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,170
there's informed choice.

878
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:49,460
Um,

879
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:54,320
there's NSF for sport and you can go to
their websites and they have lists of

880
00:25:54,321 --> 00:25:56,660
all certified products and
there's hundreds of them.

881
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:57,990
So there's,

882
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:01,160
there's no excuse that you can't find as,

883
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:01,461
you know,

884
00:26:01,461 --> 00:26:06,320
UFC athlete products that are tested
in an independently certified as banned

885
00:26:06,321 --> 00:26:07,100
substance free.

886
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,750
And if it were the case,

887
00:26:08,751 --> 00:26:11,420
and it's not saying that it couldn't
happen because those companies aren't

888
00:26:11,421 --> 00:26:13,970
testing every single bottle of product.

889
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,100
But if you're an athlete,

890
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,140
you take a third party certified product,

891
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,160
you record it,

892
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,053
you log it,

893
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:22,160
and it turns out to be from that product.

894
00:26:22,161 --> 00:26:26,390
I think then you're reaching a level
where the mitigating factors maybe do get

895
00:26:26,391 --> 00:26:28,520
you down to no sanction,

896
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:28,941
you know,

897
00:26:28,941 --> 00:26:30,140
a public warning or something.

898
00:26:30,141 --> 00:26:30,590
Hey,

899
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:30,800
you know,

900
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,900
maybe you shouldn't use
supplements at all type of thing.

901
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,141
Right?

902
00:26:33,141 --> 00:26:36,140
So his error was just taking something
that was not third party section and just

903
00:26:36,141 --> 00:26:36,951
not doing his homework.

904
00:26:36,951 --> 00:26:39,770
When a company there's a
responsibility for something like that,

905
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:40,590
six months,

906
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:41,420
it seems like a lot.

907
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:44,010
But in reality most it's a really,

908
00:26:44,011 --> 00:26:46,580
he's really only got about three months
off because most fighters after a fight

909
00:26:46,581 --> 00:26:47,810
are going to take a few months off anyway.

910
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:49,950
I mean it seems harsh but there is,

911
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:54,390
there is an obligation that fighters
need to do their homework and you need to

912
00:26:54,391 --> 00:26:56,790
have a bit of a deterrent
there to make sure they do it.

913
00:26:56,810 --> 00:26:57,460
And,

914
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:58,530
and that's that deterrent.

915
00:26:59,070 --> 00:26:59,550
Now,

916
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:02,340
one of the things that I thought was
really cool about the EOC performance

917
00:27:02,341 --> 00:27:02,880
institute,

918
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,810
which is just,

919
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:04,913
that's a,

920
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:06,900
there's so much cool about that place,

921
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:09,990
but one of the things that was really
cool is that you guys have a station where

922
00:27:09,991 --> 00:27:14,040
an athlete can go in and
check any sort of substance,

923
00:27:14,041 --> 00:27:15,030
any cold medication,

924
00:27:15,031 --> 00:27:17,070
they're taking anything
type in the name of it.

925
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:20,130
And it'll tell you on
this like giant tablet,

926
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,640
whether or not what you're taking is band.

927
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:22,991
Yeah,

928
00:27:22,991 --> 00:27:23,090
it's,

929
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:23,820
so it's,

930
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:24,421
it's a kiosk.

931
00:27:24,421 --> 00:27:27,480
So as you sought a kiosk and we have
like a little iPad in there and it's

932
00:27:27,481 --> 00:27:30,720
between the locker rooms
and the recovery room.

933
00:27:30,721 --> 00:27:33,390
So it's United got your hot
cool and your pole cold pool,

934
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,680
um,

935
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:37,710
and your sauna and your
cryo and all that stuff.

936
00:27:37,711 --> 00:27:42,090
So it's a constant reminder
as our athletes are in that
flow between that area.

937
00:27:42,091 --> 00:27:45,330
Cause they all walked through there every
day that you saw it as a part of this

938
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:45,840
sport,

939
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,280
that we're a clean sport,

940
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,470
that you have an obligation
to check on medications,

941
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,280
supplements and you have an
obligation to file your whereabouts.

942
00:27:53,281 --> 00:27:55,980
They can also file
whereabouts at that kiosk.

943
00:27:55,981 --> 00:27:58,560
And we get athletes all the time
walking down that corridor or saying,

944
00:27:58,561 --> 00:27:59,394
Oh shit,

945
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:00,600
I forgot to tell you sod.

946
00:28:00,601 --> 00:28:02,970
I flew out to Las Vegas at the Pi.

947
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:03,660
Boom.

948
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:06,690
They can get on in a minute or
two and update where they're at.

949
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:07,680
So I have an APP,

950
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:08,520
they do.

951
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,000
So,

952
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,481
um,

953
00:28:09,481 --> 00:28:10,760
so they can update by APP.

954
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,030
So it's on your phone as well.

955
00:28:12,031 --> 00:28:13,410
So every quarter,

956
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:16,950
athletes are required to get
on a through a web browser,

957
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:19,410
what's called the quarterly
you saw to whereabouts filing.

958
00:28:19,411 --> 00:28:23,250
They usually have to watch
an instructional video
most of the time reminders

959
00:28:23,251 --> 00:28:25,020
about smart supplement choices,

960
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:25,860
um,

961
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:26,671
things like that.

962
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:29,520
And then they tell you saw to where
they're going to be for the next three

963
00:28:29,521 --> 00:28:30,354
months.

964
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,800
And most of the time,

965
00:28:31,801 --> 00:28:32,041
hey,

966
00:28:32,041 --> 00:28:35,730
I mean I do Donna and I do the whereabouts
filing as well and we both say,

967
00:28:35,731 --> 00:28:36,390
Hey,

968
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:38,250
who knows where I'm going to be next week,

969
00:28:38,251 --> 00:28:40,020
let alone two or three months from now.

970
00:28:40,021 --> 00:28:41,610
But you make your best guess at it.

971
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:44,070
And then all that information you put,

972
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:44,520
uh,

973
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,550
through the web browser is
downloaded to your mobile phone app.

974
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,211
So to,

975
00:28:48,211 --> 00:28:51,000
as your plans change over
the next couple of weeks,

976
00:28:51,001 --> 00:28:51,834
couple of months,

977
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:55,950
you can do 45 second to one minute
updates through your mobile app.

978
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:56,940
Um,

979
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,110
so the convenience is there.

980
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:01,680
There's really no excuse and
not letting you saw to know,

981
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:02,610
um,

982
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:03,443
where you're at.

983
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,450
There are repercussions if you
don't let them know where you're at.

984
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:06,990
Um,

985
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:08,520
because you want to avoid somebody,

986
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:08,820
you know,

987
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,350
ducking and dodging a test.

988
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:15,390
But no cowboy had a situation where he
was actually in Vegas at the fights and

989
00:29:15,391 --> 00:29:18,720
they were mad at him cause he didn't
say that he was going to be in Vegas.

990
00:29:18,721 --> 00:29:19,081
He's like,

991
00:29:19,081 --> 00:29:20,580
I'm at the fucking fights,

992
00:29:20,581 --> 00:29:21,211
I'm right here.

993
00:29:21,211 --> 00:29:22,044
I'm on TV.

994
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:27,060
Don and I do everything we can to try
to let you saw to know that when we know

995
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,980
that a fighter has a UFC obligation,

996
00:29:28,981 --> 00:29:30,990
so whether they're our
guests fight or on the road,

997
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:31,853
whether they're,

998
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:32,430
you know,

999
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:33,600
add a competition,

1000
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:35,910
we're always passing that
information along to you saw that.

1001
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:40,080
But we also tell them that ultimately
it's your responsibility as an athlete

1002
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:41,141
will try to,

1003
00:29:41,141 --> 00:29:41,950
but you know,

1004
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:45,010
we can't guarantee it ultimately was
going to fall on you if you don't update.

1005
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,750
Now the good thing about this,

1006
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:49,810
as you're afforded a couple of
mistakes under the whereabouts program,

1007
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,610
so it's not until three whereabouts,

1008
00:29:51,611 --> 00:29:55,000
failures in any rolling 12 month
period that there can be sanctions.

1009
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:56,590
Because honestly,

1010
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,190
I mean,

1011
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:58,810
things happen in your life.

1012
00:29:58,811 --> 00:29:59,800
Everybody's human.

1013
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:01,120
Sometimes you forget.

1014
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:02,530
I'll give you the perfect example.

1015
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:03,341
So again,

1016
00:30:03,341 --> 00:30:04,180
getting back to Donna,

1017
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:05,493
the most,

1018
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:06,040
um,

1019
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:09,670
attention to detail person that I've
ever worked with him at working career,

1020
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:11,560
she comes over joints,

1021
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:13,060
kind of our program here.

1022
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,860
We get her signed up for whereabouts.

1023
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:15,371
She was like,

1024
00:30:15,371 --> 00:30:16,030
this is great.

1025
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:18,520
Like I can talk knowledgeably
about how to do this.

1026
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:21,820
We went out to Anaheim for UFC,

1027
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,620
I forget what number that was.

1028
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:24,730
Um,

1029
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:27,550
we take a trip down from
Anaheim to San Diego.

1030
00:30:27,551 --> 00:30:30,490
We went down to this clinic that we
were checking out for brain therapy.

1031
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:33,550
She forgot to update that
she was going to San Diego.

1032
00:30:33,551 --> 00:30:36,670
She was more than two hours outside
of where she was supposed to be,

1033
00:30:36,671 --> 00:30:38,200
where you sought a new
shoe was going to be,

1034
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,690
she would've gotten a
whereabouts failure again.

1035
00:30:40,691 --> 00:30:44,620
One of the mills responsible people that
I've ever been around goes to show that

1036
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,210
it's challenging and in,

1037
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:48,670
so she has to notify
where she's going to be.

1038
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:52,870
We do it voluntarily just so we can
talk knowledgeably to our athletes.

1039
00:30:52,871 --> 00:30:53,920
So when they say,

1040
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:54,251
oh,

1041
00:30:54,251 --> 00:30:55,750
this is too hard,

1042
00:30:55,751 --> 00:30:56,081
or you know,

1043
00:30:56,081 --> 00:30:56,441
we say,

1044
00:30:56,441 --> 00:30:57,191
well we do,

1045
00:30:57,191 --> 00:30:58,090
we do it right?

1046
00:30:58,210 --> 00:30:58,480
Yeah.

1047
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:58,781
Here's,

1048
00:30:58,781 --> 00:31:00,910
here's a little trick that
I had to remind myself,

1049
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:01,660
you know,

1050
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,820
each day where I said I'm going
to be at things like that.

1051
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:08,290
Now when you have a fighter like a Holly
Holm I think said she was tested nine

1052
00:31:08,291 --> 00:31:11,200
times in preparation for
this fight against Cyborg.

1053
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,220
When,

1054
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,510
when that happens,

1055
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,373
is there a,

1056
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:18,940
I know you can't say when the test is
going to happen because it won't be

1057
00:31:18,941 --> 00:31:19,774
random,

1058
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:22,690
but is there any consideration about
the sleep cycle of the fighters?

1059
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:23,561
Yeah,

1060
00:31:23,561 --> 00:31:24,250
I mean that's,

1061
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:24,820
you know,

1062
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:25,230
you saw it.

1063
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:27,550
It never lets me know
when a test is coming.

1064
00:31:27,551 --> 00:31:32,110
I have zero input in terms of who's
being tested and that is the reality.

1065
00:31:32,111 --> 00:31:36,050
A lot of times they show up
five 36 in the morning show up,

1066
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,750
really suck if fighters,

1067
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:39,190
there is no doubt about it.

1068
00:31:39,191 --> 00:31:39,941
The bird and this,

1069
00:31:39,941 --> 00:31:40,510
the urine,

1070
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:40,711
this is it.

1071
00:31:40,711 --> 00:31:42,580
Just a urine test can be blood as well.

1072
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:42,881
I mean,

1073
00:31:42,881 --> 00:31:44,890
imagine you're dead asleep.

1074
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,390
Six in the morning,

1075
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,010
someone's knocking at your front door.

1076
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:49,420
That's scary shit to begin with,

1077
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:49,900
right?

1078
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,040
You go downstairs,

1079
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:51,671
you know,

1080
00:31:51,671 --> 00:31:53,170
you're trying to get ready for a fight,

1081
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,430
prepare yourself,

1082
00:31:54,431 --> 00:31:55,750
sleep wise mentally,

1083
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,340
and you've got to have a needle stuck in.

1084
00:31:57,341 --> 00:31:58,510
You had to get to draw blood,

1085
00:31:58,690 --> 00:31:59,920
wait until you got to take a pee.

1086
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:00,490
Could be,

1087
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:00,940
you know,

1088
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,200
some fighters wait hours.

1089
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,753
Um,

1090
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,180
you know,

1091
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:08,470
I don't think enough attention is
being paid to the burden that's on the

1092
00:32:08,471 --> 00:32:09,460
athletes and the credit.

1093
00:32:09,461 --> 00:32:11,080
They should be getting a Holly Holm.

1094
00:32:11,081 --> 00:32:12,190
I think I saw,

1095
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,940
it's just a statistic that she's the most
tested athlete since the inception of

1096
00:32:15,941 --> 00:32:16,774
the program.

1097
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:20,560
I think she's around 32 or 33
samples that she's provided.

1098
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:21,281
I mean,

1099
00:32:21,281 --> 00:32:22,114
that's crazy.

1100
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:23,343
Um,

1101
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:27,070
but that I think she should not
enough credit is given to her.

1102
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:27,520
Nobody,

1103
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:30,340
they test her so many
times because she know,

1104
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:32,600
I haven't heard any
suspicions of her being no,

1105
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:33,693
neither have I.

1106
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,630
And you know,

1107
00:32:34,631 --> 00:32:37,660
I think as you look at
the testing statistics,

1108
00:32:37,661 --> 00:32:39,470
and that's another cool
thing about program.

1109
00:32:39,471 --> 00:32:40,370
I don't know if you know that,

1110
00:32:40,371 --> 00:32:41,660
but all these tests,

1111
00:32:41,661 --> 00:32:43,160
numbers are publicly available.

1112
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:47,000
So the transparency and this
program is unprecedented,

1113
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:49,430
unparalleled as it comes
to professional sports.

1114
00:32:49,431 --> 00:32:53,780
There's no other professional sport on
the planet where you or I as a fan of the

1115
00:32:53,781 --> 00:32:55,010
UFC could say,

1116
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:57,200
let me see how many times
Holly's been tested,

1117
00:32:57,201 --> 00:32:59,120
how many times Cyborg's been tested.

1118
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:00,920
That's unparalleled.

1119
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:01,970
Um,

1120
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:03,950
but if you look at those
numbers and allocation,

1121
00:33:03,951 --> 00:33:04,730
we look at them.

1122
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:07,370
I think those athletes with staying power,

1123
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:11,720
those athletes that are at the tops of
their division have more tests directed

1124
00:33:11,721 --> 00:33:12,560
to them versus,

1125
00:33:12,561 --> 00:33:12,741
you know,

1126
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:14,720
athletes at the bottom that
are jumping in and out.

1127
00:33:14,721 --> 00:33:15,321
They want to make,

1128
00:33:15,321 --> 00:33:18,800
I think you sought a good use of their
resources to make sure that they're

1129
00:33:18,801 --> 00:33:20,060
directing most of those tests.

1130
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,900
Those athletes are going
to be around for awhile.

1131
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:23,240
And I mean,

1132
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:25,220
we saw what a bad ass Holly is on,

1133
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,370
on Saturday night.

1134
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:27,320
That woman's incredible.

1135
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:28,573
And uh,

1136
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:28,821
you know,

1137
00:33:28,821 --> 00:33:30,710
I think Sida probably realizes that too.

1138
00:33:30,711 --> 00:33:32,720
And she's going to be around
for a while and wants to set,

1139
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:33,710
you know,

1140
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:34,401
an example,

1141
00:33:34,401 --> 00:33:36,050
and I tell athletes a lot,

1142
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:36,351
I say,

1143
00:33:36,351 --> 00:33:36,531
hey,

1144
00:33:36,531 --> 00:33:36,771
we're,

1145
00:33:36,771 --> 00:33:38,180
this is a badge of honor.

1146
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:39,200
You know,

1147
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,190
I know it's a burden,

1148
00:33:40,191 --> 00:33:43,910
but man that makes you even more
special of an athlete that you,

1149
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:44,570
you know,

1150
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:47,390
take that burden on and embrace it and,

1151
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,890
and show the world that you're,

1152
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:49,161
you know,

1153
00:33:49,161 --> 00:33:51,470
not only a bad ass athlete
but you're doing this clean.

1154
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:54,890
And one of the things that I thought
was really fascinating about the UFC

1155
00:33:54,891 --> 00:33:56,420
performance institute
is that machine will,

1156
00:33:56,421 --> 00:34:01,421
you lie down and it scans your entire
body and it shows where your muscle

1157
00:34:01,431 --> 00:34:02,730
imbalances are and like what,

1158
00:34:02,731 --> 00:34:02,991
what are,

1159
00:34:02,991 --> 00:34:05,540
what are all the different
details I think focuses on.

1160
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:05,991
Yeah.

1161
00:34:05,991 --> 00:34:07,700
I mean we talked about
this when he toured it,

1162
00:34:07,701 --> 00:34:08,430
but you've got to get,

1163
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:11,210
you've got to get some of the personnel
from the Pii in there that can really

1164
00:34:11,211 --> 00:34:13,040
talk knowledgeably and have,

1165
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:13,490
you know,

1166
00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:14,420
that education,

1167
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,590
I'm going to bring those guys in.

1168
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:16,813
They're going to come on.

1169
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:18,920
Not only is that,

1170
00:34:18,921 --> 00:34:21,230
as you saw at that facility world class,

1171
00:34:21,231 --> 00:34:25,100
but they staffed it with the
perfect worldclass personnel.

1172
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:27,830
So that machines called
a Dexa scan and you know,

1173
00:34:27,831 --> 00:34:31,100
I can't give it the justice
that the personnel can there,

1174
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:33,560
but it yet measures body composition.

1175
00:34:33,561 --> 00:34:34,490
So it will measure,

1176
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:34,851
you know,

1177
00:34:34,851 --> 00:34:35,470
fat,

1178
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:35,900
um,

1179
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:36,920
hydration levels,

1180
00:34:36,921 --> 00:34:37,850
bone density,

1181
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:38,923
bone density,

1182
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:40,340
and as it is it,

1183
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:44,120
how's it doing that some
type of low level x-ray.

1184
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:44,751
Again,

1185
00:34:44,751 --> 00:34:47,360
you got to get those guys in
there to describe it specifically.

1186
00:34:47,361 --> 00:34:48,670
But you know,

1187
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:52,940
I'm sure as a topic we'll cover today the
whole weight issue being in the proper

1188
00:34:52,941 --> 00:34:56,150
weight class and weight
cutting the both the,

1189
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:00,140
the equipment and now the personnel in
place of the performance institute that

1190
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:03,560
there's no excuse for an
athlete to not a fine their way,

1191
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,300
right way class and B,

1192
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:06,021
you know,

1193
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:06,770
safely,

1194
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:07,670
efficiently,

1195
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:08,090
you know,

1196
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:09,410
meet that weight goal.

1197
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:10,430
Um,

1198
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:11,211
when they're fighting,

1199
00:35:11,211 --> 00:35:12,920
everything is in place now there for that.

1200
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:16,630
Now when a fighter comes to you guys and,

1201
00:35:16,631 --> 00:35:18,890
and lies down in that machine and,

1202
00:35:18,891 --> 00:35:19,340
uh,

1203
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:24,080
you read their hydration levels and
say they're slightly dehydrated and yet

1204
00:35:24,081 --> 00:35:26,420
there's still 10 pounds
above the weight class,

1205
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:27,530
how do you handle that?

1206
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:32,400
So we have a director of sports nutrition
guy by name of Clint Wattenberg and

1207
00:35:32,401 --> 00:35:32,750
uh,

1208
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:36,410
Clint was a division one
all American at Cornell,

1209
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:38,490
Ivy League educated,

1210
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:39,630
smart as hell.

1211
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:40,231
Uh,

1212
00:35:40,231 --> 00:35:42,450
went on to wrestle with team USA.

1213
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:46,770
It's actually wrestled with a lot of our
fighters have had several conversations

1214
00:35:46,771 --> 00:35:48,340
about with guys that,

1215
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:50,370
that wrestled him before
Clinton came here.

1216
00:35:50,371 --> 00:35:51,140
So he's got,

1217
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:51,500
you know,

1218
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,250
a ton of pure respect for that.

1219
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:55,530
I'm Super Smart Guy,

1220
00:35:55,531 --> 00:35:56,580
but yet he works,

1221
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:56,940
you know,

1222
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:58,170
he'd be the guy to ask.

1223
00:35:58,171 --> 00:35:58,620
He's,

1224
00:35:58,620 --> 00:35:59,453
you know,

1225
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,690
Ivy League educated,

1226
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:01,320
um,

1227
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:05,010
in sports nutrition and
in a situation like that,

1228
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:06,200
that he's,

1229
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:06,480
you know,

1230
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,650
given advice to the fighters about how
the importance of hydration and trying to

1231
00:36:10,651 --> 00:36:12,990
change that around so that
they can meet those goals.

1232
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:13,111
Yeah,

1233
00:36:13,111 --> 00:36:14,220
there's the machine right there.

1234
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:14,910
Um,

1235
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:15,540
what is it called?

1236
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:20,540
Dual energy x-ray absorbed
appsource beyond tree.

1237
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:22,763
How do you say that?

1238
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:24,180
We call it Dexa scan,

1239
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:26,510
sore geometry.

1240
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,650
That sounds like something that
like someone would say in a cartoon,

1241
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:29,850
like a fake word.

1242
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:32,700
It measures body composition
including lean mass,

1243
00:36:32,701 --> 00:36:33,301
muscle tissue,

1244
00:36:33,301 --> 00:36:34,650
fat mass and bone density.

1245
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:37,650
Measuring and tracking all three of
these components is important for weight

1246
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:41,100
class sport athletes and helps
guide nutrition recommendations.

1247
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:42,540
Fascinating stuff.

1248
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:43,170
So,

1249
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:43,950
um,

1250
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:45,050
it just sort of scans over.

1251
00:36:45,051 --> 00:36:45,140
Yeah.

1252
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,170
How long has that test take?

1253
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:46,780
A,

1254
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:46,971
you don't,

1255
00:36:46,971 --> 00:36:49,020
I've never gone through it
or actually never seen it.

1256
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,210
I've got to get over
there and check it out.

1257
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:51,063
I Dunno.

1258
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,660
It was interesting with
Forrest was t doing,

1259
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,110
Forrest Griffin was telling me that uh,

1260
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:55,680
when he had it done,

1261
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:58,980
he found out that one of his legs has
two pounds more muscle than the other leg

1262
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:01,500
because he had had some knee
injuries and you really had no idea.

1263
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:01,801
Yeah,

1264
00:37:01,801 --> 00:37:02,634
it's crazy.

1265
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:03,080
I mean,

1266
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:03,500
so,

1267
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,950
so forest is a big part of that.

1268
00:37:04,951 --> 00:37:07,590
Performance Institute was a big part of,

1269
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,310
you know,

1270
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:10,710
touring other facilities around the world.

1271
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,720
I think him and James Campbell,

1272
00:37:12,721 --> 00:37:14,640
who's our VP of operations at the Pii,

1273
00:37:14,641 --> 00:37:19,350
went to 61 or 62 facilities throughout
the world and took would they believe

1274
00:37:19,351 --> 00:37:23,250
were the best parts of these facilities
and put them all to one and forces role

1275
00:37:23,251 --> 00:37:23,880
there.

1276
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,600
Um,

1277
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,250
is,

1278
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:25,570
you know,

1279
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:29,160
kind of similar to my role in the
anti-doping program and advocate for our

1280
00:37:29,161 --> 00:37:29,994
athletes.

1281
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:34,710
He's there to make sure as
a former fighter knowing
what works and what doesn't

1282
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:35,390
work.

1283
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:35,910
Um,

1284
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:38,910
we're looking at a video of this thing
right now and it looks like star trek is

1285
00:37:38,911 --> 00:37:38,971
it,

1286
00:37:38,971 --> 00:37:40,310
what does it saying anything Jamie,

1287
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:43,800
very end of pans over and shows
what shows up on the screen.

1288
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,920
There's a coming in like bunches
of different data points.

1289
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:47,820
This is amazing.

1290
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,390
Yes.

1291
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:50,850
I mean I talked to you I thought maybe
last week and get you out there earlier,

1292
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:51,780
but you got to come.

1293
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:52,531
I'm going to next time.

1294
00:37:52,531 --> 00:37:55,800
Next time in March should come
day or excuse me a day early.

1295
00:37:55,801 --> 00:37:56,131
Just do,

1296
00:37:56,131 --> 00:37:57,360
they'll put you through the whole thing.

1297
00:37:57,361 --> 00:37:58,950
We get you get your Dexa scan done,

1298
00:37:58,951 --> 00:38:00,180
your body composition.

1299
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:01,530
You then have a meeting with Clint,

1300
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:03,900
talk about nutrition and goals.

1301
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:06,020
Maybe go see the physical therapist,

1302
00:38:06,021 --> 00:38:09,840
talk about any issues you
have and therapy you need.

1303
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:13,620
Go work out with our strength
and conditioning coach
both Sandovall it puts you

1304
00:38:13,621 --> 00:38:14,280
through the,

1305
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:18,680
the ringers and the equipment there and
then do a little recovery after that

1306
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,340
that really gave you the full experience.

1307
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:20,791
Yeah,

1308
00:38:20,791 --> 00:38:23,340
that place is amazing how you
guys get it set up and it's,

1309
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,040
it's really,

1310
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:25,650
uh,

1311
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:26,280
uh,

1312
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:29,220
a massive resource for fighters that if,

1313
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:31,350
because there's a lot of
great Jim's out there,

1314
00:38:31,351 --> 00:38:35,230
but I don't think I've ever seen one
that's that well equipped that you guys

1315
00:38:35,231 --> 00:38:36,100
have everything.

1316
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:39,790
You have a complete strength
and conditioning system,

1317
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:40,330
uh,

1318
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:40,990
area.

1319
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:43,270
And then you have a complete area for,

1320
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,740
with heavy bags,

1321
00:38:44,741 --> 00:38:46,960
a cage boxing ring,

1322
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:49,240
and then you have a
complete recovery area.

1323
00:38:49,241 --> 00:38:50,920
You have cryo machines,

1324
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:51,690
you have that,

1325
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:53,020
what does that light machine?

1326
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:53,480
Yeah,

1327
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:58,360
it's like low level laser light therapy
that looks like a giant tanning bed that

1328
00:38:58,361 --> 00:38:58,871
you get in.

1329
00:38:58,871 --> 00:39:00,490
And I've seen that thing before.

1330
00:39:00,491 --> 00:39:01,360
And what does that supposed to do?

1331
00:39:01,361 --> 00:39:05,670
It's supposed to somehow
or another stimulate that
work on your recovery and in

1332
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,700
at the cellular level.

1333
00:39:06,701 --> 00:39:07,001
Again,

1334
00:39:07,001 --> 00:39:07,840
you need to get these,

1335
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,840
these Pi personnel in here to,

1336
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,170
to explain it in detail,

1337
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:12,730
you guys even have sleep pods,

1338
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:14,380
which I thought it was
the craziest thing ever.

1339
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:17,500
It was so like if a fighter
just has like an hour to chill,

1340
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:19,570
they can just get in there
and recover and relax.

1341
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:19,810
Yeah.

1342
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:22,540
I mean the idea is you come
to the performance institute.

1343
00:39:22,541 --> 00:39:22,691
Yeah.

1344
00:39:22,691 --> 00:39:26,530
They're there and don't get dope
and I hear this all the time.

1345
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:26,750
They,

1346
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:27,700
they see the,

1347
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:28,620
the,

1348
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:29,410
the equipment,

1349
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:31,120
the personnel that's available to them.

1350
00:39:31,121 --> 00:39:34,730
They see when it's time to unwind that
they have a room like this to relax in.

1351
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:35,231
They see you.

1352
00:39:35,231 --> 00:39:39,640
They have free use of the
cafeteria and custom cook meals.

1353
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:40,900
They don't want to leave the place.

1354
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,130
They're there all day long.

1355
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:43,800
Frances and Ghana,

1356
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:44,773
yeah.

1357
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:47,080
Lives has lived there the last six months.

1358
00:39:47,081 --> 00:39:51,070
There's a running joke in the office at
Francis has constantly walking around

1359
00:39:51,071 --> 00:39:52,480
the office in between workouts.

1360
00:39:52,481 --> 00:39:52,691
It's like,

1361
00:39:52,691 --> 00:39:53,051
Francis,

1362
00:39:53,051 --> 00:39:54,510
we got to get you an office
here or something like that.

1363
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:55,893
What are you doing?

1364
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:56,860
Yeah,

1365
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,190
that's the guy you saw.

1366
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,920
I mean the dude move to la,

1367
00:39:59,921 --> 00:40:03,850
he saw the place and he moved
up and moved everything he had.

1368
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:07,020
I don't think he knew anybody in
Las Vegas or not any friends there.

1369
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:07,750
Cause he's,

1370
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:10,900
he's just walking around the office all
day long when he's not at the Pi from

1371
00:40:10,901 --> 00:40:11,470
France,

1372
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:12,303
from France,

1373
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:13,300
from another country.

1374
00:40:13,301 --> 00:40:14,650
He said exactly.

1375
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,910
But you know the perfect example of seeing
what that place could do for him and

1376
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:21,250
that's available to every
single fight or on the roster.

1377
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:21,791
Yeah.

1378
00:40:21,791 --> 00:40:23,440
I mean there's nothing like it.

1379
00:40:23,441 --> 00:40:27,820
And my prediction is that the UFC is going
to be the hub where most people live.

1380
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:30,310
The only thing that's wrong
there is the altitude.

1381
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:31,510
That's the only thing that's wrong.

1382
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:36,780
And I know you guys have a hypoxic room
where you can stimulate or simulate a

1383
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:37,660
high altitude.

1384
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:37,900
Yeah,

1385
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:38,980
I think 22,000 feet,

1386
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:40,990
but isn't the way you're
supposed to do it?

1387
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:43,180
You're supposed to work at sea level,

1388
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:44,830
but sleep at high altitude.

1389
00:40:44,831 --> 00:40:45,590
Isn't that how it's supposed to be?

1390
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:46,510
I think that's what it is.

1391
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:47,750
You know what Does Bay,

1392
00:40:47,751 --> 00:40:50,080
so 2,500 3000 feet,

1393
00:40:50,081 --> 00:40:51,510
so it even isn't really,

1394
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:52,180
that's interesting.

1395
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:53,230
I didn't even know it was that high.

1396
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:53,880
I think it is.

1397
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,713
Yep.

1398
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:55,900
I thought it was a little low.

1399
00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:58,060
I thought it was like c
level cause it's like desert.

1400
00:40:58,090 --> 00:40:58,420
No,

1401
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:58,750
no,

1402
00:40:58,750 --> 00:40:58,931
no.

1403
00:40:58,931 --> 00:40:59,764
It's got a little bit out.

1404
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:02,500
I know Nevada has some
good mountain areas though.

1405
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:05,710
Just outside were guys can
run and do things like that.

1406
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:06,110
Yeah.

1407
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:06,420
Does,

1408
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:10,540
does the performance institute take people
on any tracks or anything like that?

1409
00:41:10,541 --> 00:41:12,070
I don't think we've
gotten to that level yet.

1410
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:13,390
I got to be a good thing to do.

1411
00:41:13,391 --> 00:41:13,690
Right.

1412
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:15,160
Could make to red rocks for runs.

1413
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:15,680
There you go.

1414
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,513
It's a good idea.

1415
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:20,440
I mean I just think that if really high
level coaches start moving there and

1416
00:41:20,441 --> 00:41:22,610
obviously we just lost one
of the best Robert Follis,

1417
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:23,800
which is a huge,

1418
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,061
huge loss.

1419
00:41:25,061 --> 00:41:27,490
And what a great guy and say,

1420
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:30,550
I mean universally nicest guy
ever and it was a great deal.

1421
00:41:30,551 --> 00:41:31,384
Universally loved,

1422
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:34,100
very few people that are fight
coaches that are universally

1423
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:34,670
loved.

1424
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:35,660
And Robert Really was.

1425
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:36,590
But um,

1426
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:36,771
you know,

1427
00:41:36,771 --> 00:41:38,420
Vegas has some good coaches,

1428
00:41:38,421 --> 00:41:41,810
but I anticipate more and more gyms
moving and relocating there and bring

1429
00:41:41,811 --> 00:41:44,810
fighters there because I just think high
level fighters going to see that place

1430
00:41:44,811 --> 00:41:45,110
and go,

1431
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:49,430
how can I recreate this anywhere
without fucking millions and millions of

1432
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:49,640
dollars?

1433
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,181
I think so.

1434
00:41:50,181 --> 00:41:50,421
I mean,

1435
00:41:50,421 --> 00:41:51,500
we love to see that happen.

1436
00:41:51,501 --> 00:41:51,711
It's,

1437
00:41:51,711 --> 00:41:51,921
you know,

1438
00:41:51,921 --> 00:41:52,790
a good low cost,

1439
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:54,800
relatively low cost of living area.

1440
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:55,340
Um,

1441
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:58,250
so it's a place that's affordable and uh,

1442
00:41:58,370 --> 00:41:58,641
yeah,

1443
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:01,160
I think he spent a little bit of time
with the Pii and see what you can do,

1444
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:03,260
what it can do for you as a UFC athlete.

1445
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:04,161
And just when I was,

1446
00:42:04,161 --> 00:42:04,311
oh,

1447
00:42:04,311 --> 00:42:04,790
go ahead.

1448
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:05,780
I think the other cool thing,

1449
00:42:05,781 --> 00:42:07,340
and I know Dunkin French,

1450
00:42:07,341 --> 00:42:08,600
he's doctor Dunkin France.

1451
00:42:08,601 --> 00:42:10,580
She's our VP of performance,

1452
00:42:10,610 --> 00:42:11,443
um,

1453
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:12,770
there and a,

1454
00:42:12,771 --> 00:42:17,120
which he explained it a little bit to
you about is that not only are we looking

1455
00:42:17,121 --> 00:42:22,121
to influence the UFC athlete but also
influenced positively and I may the whole

1456
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:27,440
the entire sport and what you're seeing
is UFC athletes can come in there and

1457
00:42:27,441 --> 00:42:27,801
use it,

1458
00:42:27,801 --> 00:42:30,530
but they can also bring along
with them training partners,

1459
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:31,850
coaches,

1460
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,081
and you know,

1461
00:42:33,081 --> 00:42:35,030
we're only seven or
eight months into this,

1462
00:42:35,031 --> 00:42:36,620
but what we've already seen as,

1463
00:42:36,621 --> 00:42:36,861
you know,

1464
00:42:36,861 --> 00:42:38,150
training ideas,

1465
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:39,830
proper nutrition,

1466
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,110
going back out to these gyms,

1467
00:42:42,111 --> 00:42:44,510
not only across the u
s but across the world.

1468
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:49,540
So we definitely hope to be a positive
influence throughout all of them and May

1469
00:42:49,731 --> 00:42:50,110
and,

1470
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:50,943
and really,

1471
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,070
really grow the sport.

1472
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:52,430
Yeah,

1473
00:42:52,430 --> 00:42:53,540
I saw that with Bobby Green,

1474
00:42:53,541 --> 00:42:54,440
Bobby Green who was there,

1475
00:42:54,441 --> 00:42:57,590
I brought a couple of his training
partners and just on a random day,

1476
00:42:57,591 --> 00:42:58,850
Wilson Hayes was there,

1477
00:42:58,851 --> 00:43:00,110
Angela Hill was there.

1478
00:43:00,111 --> 00:43:01,790
There's quite a few cycles thing ever.

1479
00:43:01,791 --> 00:43:02,550
I love,

1480
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:06,260
I'll go over there when I'm in the office
multiple times a day just to see who's

1481
00:43:06,261 --> 00:43:08,420
in there that day and have,

1482
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:08,840
you know,

1483
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:09,381
that five,

1484
00:43:09,381 --> 00:43:14,330
10 minute conversation with a Wilson Hayes
that he knows me going forward in the

1485
00:43:14,331 --> 00:43:18,110
future and that Jeff's a cool guy and
when that medication or supplement

1486
00:43:18,111 --> 00:43:19,190
question comes up,

1487
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:20,930
he's talked to me before,

1488
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:24,140
he knows who I am is not afraid to pick
up the phone and asked me that question

1489
00:43:24,141 --> 00:43:24,974
versus hey,

1490
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,150
this golden snitch character,

1491
00:43:26,151 --> 00:43:26,984
I don't know,

1492
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:29,450
I don't know who this guy is not
going to call him or trust him.

1493
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:32,720
It's a big part of what I do is
try to develop those pet trusts.

1494
00:43:32,721 --> 00:43:36,830
So thanks to shop or send me back about
two and a half years were developed in

1495
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:39,080
that trust and a nickname
that doesn't even make sense.

1496
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:40,640
It literally doesn't make sense.

1497
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:41,660
But it's funny.

1498
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:42,560
Um,

1499
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:46,970
is there any other plans to expand
or do more things with the institute?

1500
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:47,481
There is.

1501
00:43:47,481 --> 00:43:48,740
So we didn't show you this,

1502
00:43:48,741 --> 00:43:52,010
but there are other areas
upstairs for that very reason.

1503
00:43:52,011 --> 00:43:56,030
They thought about hey technology and a
couple of years or maybe new machines or

1504
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:58,370
devices that come onto
line that we may want.

1505
00:43:58,371 --> 00:44:00,770
So there is additional
room for expansion there.

1506
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:03,890
I talked to you guys and I
talked to Duncan about a tank,

1507
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:05,840
about you guys getting tanks in there.

1508
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:06,250
Uh,

1509
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:07,850
s sensory deprivation tanks.

1510
00:44:07,851 --> 00:44:08,900
I think that would be massive.

1511
00:44:08,901 --> 00:44:12,200
I know a lot of football teams are using
them now and it's starting to spread,

1512
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:12,950
um,

1513
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:15,830
excellent source of magnesium because
you're absorbing it through the skin.

1514
00:44:15,830 --> 00:44:18,260
But just for relaxation recuperation.

1515
00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:22,220
I would be fascinated to
see if you guys had those.

1516
00:44:22,221 --> 00:44:23,430
Like what kind of results you'd yeah,

1517
00:44:23,431 --> 00:44:24,231
I mean it sounded to me,

1518
00:44:24,231 --> 00:44:25,640
and I was there when
you're talking about it,

1519
00:44:25,641 --> 00:44:28,360
that Dunkin was open to it and it
was talking about some research,

1520
00:44:28,361 --> 00:44:31,350
I think you said Ohio State University
is conducting some research on the

1521
00:44:31,351 --> 00:44:32,131
benefits of that.

1522
00:44:32,131 --> 00:44:34,290
So I know there's tanks in Vegas now.

1523
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:35,820
I know there's a place in Vegas,

1524
00:44:35,821 --> 00:44:38,970
so I'm sure whoever runs that tank
thing going to reach out to me.

1525
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:40,740
So I want to get you in touch with them.

1526
00:44:40,770 --> 00:44:42,060
And how just have you try it.

1527
00:44:42,090 --> 00:44:43,080
Just see if,

1528
00:44:43,081 --> 00:44:43,980
you know,

1529
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:44,281
just,

1530
00:44:44,281 --> 00:44:45,170
just to get a beat on his,

1531
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:48,480
it's a freaky experience and
it's really good for your body.

1532
00:44:48,481 --> 00:44:50,340
Just everything like in your back.

1533
00:44:50,341 --> 00:44:53,700
We'll just sort of just loosen up
because you're essentially zero gravity.

1534
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:54,533
You're floating.

1535
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:54,871
It's just,

1536
00:44:54,871 --> 00:44:57,750
everything's sort of pops and
loosens up and it's amazing.

1537
00:44:57,751 --> 00:44:58,021
It's cool.

1538
00:44:58,021 --> 00:44:58,491
I want to try it.

1539
00:44:58,491 --> 00:44:59,590
I saw yours a little bit ago.

1540
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:00,180
It's little,

1541
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:02,250
little intimidating or scary
and looking weird person.

1542
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,620
My wife made me move
it out of the basement.

1543
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:06,150
I had one in the basement.

1544
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:06,571
She's like,

1545
00:45:06,571 --> 00:45:07,261
people come over,

1546
00:45:07,261 --> 00:45:08,094
they think you're afraid.

1547
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:10,140
I think I'm a freak.

1548
00:45:10,350 --> 00:45:11,100
But um,

1549
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:14,370
the idea behind it I think
is pretty sound and I think,

1550
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:14,970
um,

1551
00:45:14,970 --> 00:45:16,620
there's a lot of benefits for it,

1552
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:16,921
uh,

1553
00:45:16,921 --> 00:45:19,740
for fighters as far as
concentrating on technique as well.

1554
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:24,810
I think it's an amazing place to focus
on strategy and game plans and movement

1555
00:45:24,811 --> 00:45:25,740
and things along those lines.

1556
00:45:25,741 --> 00:45:29,580
We can visualize one of the most
amazing things with the sport and I,

1557
00:45:29,581 --> 00:45:29,940
you know,

1558
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:31,020
coming over to the UFC,

1559
00:45:31,021 --> 00:45:32,940
I call myself a fringe fan.

1560
00:45:32,941 --> 00:45:34,590
I'm Alec follow it a little bit,

1561
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:35,310
but I'm,

1562
00:45:35,310 --> 00:45:35,941
I'm hook,

1563
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:37,470
line and sinker into the sport now.

1564
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:42,390
And the most remarkable thing I find
about the sport is the mental game.

1565
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:47,960
It is the most incredible mental game of
any athlete in any sport in the world.

1566
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:55,010
When you're walking out into an octagon
and facing one of the baddest mixed

1567
00:45:55,021 --> 00:45:56,940
martial artists and the planet.

1568
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:58,530
And you know,

1569
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:01,440
I know you've seen a ton
of fights over your career,

1570
00:46:01,441 --> 00:46:02,800
but I think one thing that,

1571
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,190
that I've seen the two and a
half years and you may not,

1572
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:06,960
is that progression through fight week.

1573
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:10,040
So when I go out to these
events or events or in Vegas,

1574
00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:15,050
some there checking day Monday or
Tuesday at five week and typically we're,

1575
00:46:15,550 --> 00:46:19,470
we're on the road on there every day in
the same hotel and watching these guys

1576
00:46:19,471 --> 00:46:20,520
and girls eat breakfast.

1577
00:46:20,521 --> 00:46:22,080
I'm watching them at the gym prepare,

1578
00:46:22,081 --> 00:46:23,580
try to make weight on Friday.

1579
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:27,300
I'm watching them Saturday morning with
the prospect of the fight ahead of them.

1580
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:32,960
What an incredible mental journey it is
to know that you're about to get into,

1581
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:33,870
you know,

1582
00:46:33,870 --> 00:46:36,690
a cage with one of the baddest
fighters on the planet.

1583
00:46:37,110 --> 00:46:38,220
Then even if you win,

1584
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:39,120
probably come out,

1585
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:39,450
you know,

1586
00:46:39,450 --> 00:46:40,770
with a little bit of damage,

1587
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:42,110
I mean everything to,

1588
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:43,003
to fight night,

1589
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:44,333
fight night.

1590
00:46:44,590 --> 00:46:45,060
These,

1591
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:46,860
these athletes are in a locker room,

1592
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:49,290
typically with three
or four other athletes.

1593
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:52,830
And especially if you're one of the last
athletes on that card and one by one

1594
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:57,630
your locker mates are walking out
and then coming back in and you see,

1595
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:58,260
you know,

1596
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:00,090
damage on even the ones that win.

1597
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:04,260
And unlike other sports where you get
out on the field and you warm up and you

1598
00:47:04,261 --> 00:47:06,780
get a little sense of what
the atmosphere is like,

1599
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:08,820
these athletes are walking out,

1600
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:09,480
you know,

1601
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:10,620
into the lion's den,

1602
00:47:10,621 --> 00:47:15,621
seeing it for the first time and
the sensory overwhelming sensory,

1603
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:16,050
uh,

1604
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:20,370
things that are going on when doing that
and to be able to control your emotions

1605
00:47:20,371 --> 00:47:20,980
and,

1606
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:21,600
and,

1607
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:22,260
you know,

1608
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:25,680
compete against somebody is just
absolutely the most incredible thing that,

1609
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:26,640
that I've ever seen.

1610
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:28,080
I'm so amazed at,

1611
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:29,173
and you know,

1612
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:32,140
very few of these fighters and
I talked to a lot of them had,

1613
00:47:32,141 --> 00:47:34,300
doesn't get to them in some way or form.

1614
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:35,380
Um,

1615
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:35,831
that is uh,

1616
00:47:35,831 --> 00:47:36,041
you know,

1617
00:47:36,041 --> 00:47:37,720
talk to forest often about that enforce.

1618
00:47:37,830 --> 00:47:42,010
It's like it says he equates it to if
you'd never jumped out of an airplane the

1619
00:47:42,011 --> 00:47:43,690
whole time you're on the way up saying,

1620
00:47:43,691 --> 00:47:44,980
what the hell am I doing?

1621
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:46,450
This is crazy.

1622
00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:47,830
And then,

1623
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:48,101
you know,

1624
00:47:48,101 --> 00:47:50,250
when the bell rings
and you start fighting,

1625
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:52,190
then it kind of calms
down your back in your,

1626
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:53,080
your kind of zone.

1627
00:47:53,081 --> 00:47:57,190
But just what an incredible
mental game this is.

1628
00:47:57,191 --> 00:48:00,460
And I just have so much respect for our
athletes because of what they have to go

1629
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:03,160
through and they're able to do it
time and time again and control those

1630
00:48:03,161 --> 00:48:03,994
emotions.

1631
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,140
You bring up an important point and um,

1632
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:10,270
mental training is something that a lot
of athletes have really concentrated on

1633
00:48:10,271 --> 00:48:14,380
more over the last few years than
I think ever that I could recall.

1634
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:17,380
And a lot of them bringing hypnotists
and a lot of bringing in sports

1635
00:48:17,381 --> 00:48:18,214
psychologists.

1636
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:21,810
Is there ever been any talk of bringing
that to the performance institute?

1637
00:48:21,811 --> 00:48:22,000
Yeah.

1638
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:22,181
You know,

1639
00:48:22,181 --> 00:48:22,601
I've talked,

1640
00:48:22,601 --> 00:48:24,370
I talked briefly with
Dunkin about it who has it,

1641
00:48:24,371 --> 00:48:24,671
you know,

1642
00:48:24,671 --> 00:48:28,720
a ton of resources in the
athletic performance field.

1643
00:48:28,721 --> 00:48:29,560
And um,

1644
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:31,060
so we've talked briefly about that.

1645
00:48:31,061 --> 00:48:31,780
But um,

1646
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:32,830
nobody on the staff,

1647
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:33,041
you know,

1648
00:48:33,041 --> 00:48:34,360
currently it's,

1649
00:48:34,390 --> 00:48:35,150
you know,

1650
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:35,983
it's,

1651
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,780
it's kind of a give and take.

1652
00:48:37,781 --> 00:48:38,021
Look,

1653
00:48:38,021 --> 00:48:40,720
we want to provide all these
resources to our athletes,

1654
00:48:40,721 --> 00:48:43,840
but we also want them to
retain their independence.

1655
00:48:43,841 --> 00:48:44,650
I mean,

1656
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:45,100
you don't,

1657
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:47,320
if you notice in the
performance institute,

1658
00:48:47,321 --> 00:48:48,930
there is no MMA coaches there.

1659
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:51,670
There was no striking wrestling coaches,

1660
00:48:51,671 --> 00:48:52,660
Jujitsu coaches,

1661
00:48:52,661 --> 00:48:53,494
none of that.

1662
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:56,860
That's for the athlete to bring in
because there needs to be some level of

1663
00:48:56,861 --> 00:48:57,461
independence.

1664
00:48:57,461 --> 00:48:59,260
You don't want to train the entire roster,

1665
00:48:59,320 --> 00:48:59,651
you know,

1666
00:48:59,651 --> 00:49:01,030
the same way itself.

1667
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:01,661
Exactly.

1668
00:49:01,661 --> 00:49:02,510
It's exactly,

1669
00:49:02,511 --> 00:49:03,344
it sounds like it was.

1670
00:49:03,530 --> 00:49:07,660
I saw early on in my
tenure here with the UFC,

1671
00:49:07,661 --> 00:49:09,470
I saw one of the most
incredible things that,

1672
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:10,420
that I've ever seen.

1673
00:49:10,421 --> 00:49:11,440
I've only seen it once,

1674
00:49:11,441 --> 00:49:13,900
but I saw a fighter show up,

1675
00:49:13,901 --> 00:49:18,100
fight night outside the locker
room and basically said,

1676
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:19,180
I don't want to go in.

1677
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:21,550
I don't want to do this at the arena.

1678
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:22,630
Really?

1679
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:23,740
And I mean,

1680
00:49:23,741 --> 00:49:25,240
I was just blown away.

1681
00:49:25,241 --> 00:49:25,830
And uh,

1682
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:28,750
actually Sean Shelby went up
and thought it was awesome.

1683
00:49:28,751 --> 00:49:31,420
Had a great conversation with the fighter.

1684
00:49:31,421 --> 00:49:31,631
Said,

1685
00:49:31,631 --> 00:49:32,464
look,

1686
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:37,420
you're not feeling anything that everybody
doesn't feel every single fight or on

1687
00:49:37,421 --> 00:49:38,231
the roster fields,

1688
00:49:38,231 --> 00:49:39,340
which you're feeling right now.

1689
00:49:39,370 --> 00:49:41,170
You're just letting it get the best you.

1690
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:42,161
You know,

1691
00:49:42,161 --> 00:49:43,390
you're a Badass fighter.

1692
00:49:43,870 --> 00:49:44,201
You know,

1693
00:49:44,201 --> 00:49:45,520
you've kicked ass before,

1694
00:49:45,730 --> 00:49:46,930
you've gotten beat before.

1695
00:49:47,410 --> 00:49:47,711
Uh,

1696
00:49:47,711 --> 00:49:47,981
you know,

1697
00:49:47,981 --> 00:49:49,090
what's the worst going to happen?

1698
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:49,391
You're going to,

1699
00:49:49,391 --> 00:49:50,081
you're going to get beat.

1700
00:49:50,081 --> 00:49:51,250
You're going to live through this thing.

1701
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,810
You're just letting it surface.

1702
00:49:52,870 --> 00:49:54,460
Everybody feels what you're feeling.

1703
00:49:54,850 --> 00:49:55,750
And for a second,

1704
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:56,660
you know,

1705
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:59,110
the fighter came back a
little bit and then boom,

1706
00:49:59,111 --> 00:49:59,944
left the arena.

1707
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:00,580
Whoa.

1708
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:01,413
Crazy.

1709
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:06,190
But I think that must enter into
the head or the prospect of that,

1710
00:50:06,191 --> 00:50:07,630
of every single person,

1711
00:50:07,631 --> 00:50:09,100
every single fighter
that comes here being,

1712
00:50:09,101 --> 00:50:11,790
and I'm sure there's just a little
bit of that and the back of the head.

1713
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:15,430
It's just an incredible journey
to see them mentally overcome.

1714
00:50:15,970 --> 00:50:16,780
Um,

1715
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:18,040
that amount of stress.

1716
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:19,630
The pre fight is incredible.

1717
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:23,170
Why it's so interesting to see a guy
like Conor who silver laxed in there.

1718
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:24,490
It's kind of weird,

1719
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:24,971
you know,

1720
00:50:24,971 --> 00:50:28,040
like when he does that rubber
arms strut loose walking

1721
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:28,641
around the cage,

1722
00:50:28,641 --> 00:50:33,050
he's Kinda like letting you know how
he is dealing with this better than you

1723
00:50:33,051 --> 00:50:33,650
are.

1724
00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:33,831
You know,

1725
00:50:33,831 --> 00:50:34,790
the one fighter that,

1726
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:35,300
uh,

1727
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:39,110
cause I paid really close attention
after having seen that early pay really

1728
00:50:39,111 --> 00:50:41,540
close attention just to see
that fight or on the walkout,

1729
00:50:41,590 --> 00:50:45,380
like to sit in a pretty close to the cage
and just look at that fighter's eyes.

1730
00:50:45,381 --> 00:50:46,214
And I,

1731
00:50:46,310 --> 00:50:48,780
I tend to see a little bit
of nervousness and fear and,

1732
00:50:48,970 --> 00:50:49,700
and everyone,

1733
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:51,080
I think it's probably healthy.

1734
00:50:51,470 --> 00:50:56,360
One person that sticks out that I looked
at and I saw nothing in this dude's

1735
00:50:56,361 --> 00:50:56,631
face.

1736
00:50:56,631 --> 00:50:57,920
I saw like a little smirk,

1737
00:50:57,921 --> 00:51:01,250
like he was so happy to be in there and
it's the first time I've seen this guy

1738
00:51:01,251 --> 00:51:03,830
fight and that's just engaging.

1739
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:05,600
When he fought Michael Johnson,

1740
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:06,351
I remember look,

1741
00:51:06,351 --> 00:51:09,980
and he walked in first and I was sitting
on one side and he's on the other side

1742
00:51:09,981 --> 00:51:14,270
of the cage and looking in his eyes
and I had never seen him fight before.

1743
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:15,653
And I'm like,

1744
00:51:15,890 --> 00:51:16,850
who is this guy?

1745
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:19,430
He looks like he's happy to
be in there like this is,

1746
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:19,880
you know,

1747
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:20,930
some parties at.

1748
00:51:20,931 --> 00:51:22,610
And that fight was incredible.

1749
00:51:22,730 --> 00:51:22,881
Well,

1750
00:51:22,881 --> 00:51:23,391
he's crazy,

1751
00:51:23,391 --> 00:51:23,930
wasn't it?

1752
00:51:23,930 --> 00:51:25,130
He's legitimately crazy.

1753
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,200
He said that getting knocked
out by Eddie Alvarez,

1754
00:51:27,201 --> 00:51:28,850
the greatest thing that ever
happened to him in his life,

1755
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:30,230
he's a different breed.

1756
00:51:31,370 --> 00:51:31,641
Yeah,

1757
00:51:31,641 --> 00:51:33,980
well he's got a mindset
and that mindset is,

1758
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:34,610
um,

1759
00:51:34,610 --> 00:51:36,170
coming to go to war.

1760
00:51:36,171 --> 00:51:37,550
And he said it when he got signed,

1761
00:51:37,551 --> 00:51:37,820
he said,

1762
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:38,210
uh,

1763
00:51:38,210 --> 00:51:39,350
over the next couple of years,

1764
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:40,340
I'm going to get knocked out.

1765
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:41,630
Someone's going to knock me out.

1766
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:42,231
He goes,

1767
00:51:42,231 --> 00:51:45,260
but I'm going to knock a lot of people
out and I'm going to break people,

1768
00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:46,371
you know?

1769
00:51:46,371 --> 00:51:48,350
And the only way to
stop me to shut me off.

1770
00:51:48,410 --> 00:51:48,921
And he goes,

1771
00:51:48,921 --> 00:51:49,520
I'm human.

1772
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:50,353
I can be shut off.

1773
00:51:50,870 --> 00:51:52,670
I want to watch that guy fight every time.

1774
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:54,313
Every time.

1775
00:51:54,410 --> 00:51:54,800
Yeah.

1776
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,360
I mean that's an incredible mindset.

1777
00:51:56,390 --> 00:51:59,660
And I don't know if you can teach that.

1778
00:51:59,690 --> 00:52:02,690
I think a lot of people say you
can't teach mental strength.

1779
00:52:02,691 --> 00:52:03,201
And I don't,

1780
00:52:03,201 --> 00:52:04,180
I think that's horseshit.

1781
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:05,690
I think you could teach everything.

1782
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:09,170
I think the mind can be,

1783
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:10,340
can be trained.

1784
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,790
I mean this is what they do in bootcamp,

1785
00:52:11,810 --> 00:52:12,110
right?

1786
00:52:12,110 --> 00:52:12,351
I mean,

1787
00:52:12,351 --> 00:52:14,090
and it works to varying
degrees of success.

1788
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:16,460
I think the mind can be trained.

1789
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:18,380
It's just a matter of
what's your baseline?

1790
00:52:18,410 --> 00:52:19,400
Where are you coming in at?

1791
00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:22,580
Are you a total scaredy cat
or are you a pretty stoic,

1792
00:52:22,610 --> 00:52:24,260
rugged dude to begin with?

1793
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:26,150
And what can they do?

1794
00:52:26,151 --> 00:52:26,870
And maybe,

1795
00:52:26,870 --> 00:52:27,920
maybe you're too stuck.

1796
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:28,671
Maybe you're,

1797
00:52:28,671 --> 00:52:32,450
you're too nonemotional and
you're to non vulnerable and you,

1798
00:52:32,451 --> 00:52:34,040
you're delusional and your perceptions.

1799
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:37,160
It's amazing seeing the different ways
that different athletes deal with it.

1800
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:38,240
So Saturday night,

1801
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:39,470
I give you a perfect example.

1802
00:52:39,471 --> 00:52:41,060
So fight night,

1803
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:41,930
um,

1804
00:52:41,930 --> 00:52:42,740
you know,

1805
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:44,330
you saw it as the one doing the testing.

1806
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:45,320
A lot of times fight night.

1807
00:52:45,321 --> 00:52:49,040
There's not a lot going on in my world
on there to put out fires in case

1808
00:52:49,041 --> 00:52:50,180
something does go on.

1809
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,130
I like to watch the fights close.

1810
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:53,060
Um,

1811
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:55,130
just to see those things
we're talking about here.

1812
00:52:55,131 --> 00:52:55,700
So,

1813
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:56,540
but occasionally I'll,

1814
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:59,210
I'll pop in backstage just to
make sure everything's going good.

1815
00:52:59,211 --> 00:53:04,211
So I walked back there before the Holly
Cyborg fight and so Holly was out in the

1816
00:53:06,111 --> 00:53:06,944
Hallway,

1817
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:07,730
um,

1818
00:53:07,730 --> 00:53:12,500
getting ready to do that long walk for
the championship bout and she was there

1819
00:53:12,501 --> 00:53:14,060
for probably about 10 minutes.

1820
00:53:14,061 --> 00:53:15,980
Camera's getting ready
and she was doing that.

1821
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:21,040
Holly pacing back and forth and her
hands together firing herself up when she

1822
00:53:22,131 --> 00:53:23,810
did it for a good 10 minutes back there.

1823
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:24,501
And then you see,

1824
00:53:24,501 --> 00:53:26,010
once she gets in the cage,

1825
00:53:26,011 --> 00:53:29,970
she was the first one in their
pacing back and forth for 10 minutes.

1826
00:53:29,971 --> 00:53:30,360
Right.

1827
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:32,670
Hitting the hands together every between,

1828
00:53:32,671 --> 00:53:35,340
every single round she'd get
off that stool back and forth,

1829
00:53:35,341 --> 00:53:35,791
pacing,

1830
00:53:35,791 --> 00:53:36,900
hitting the hands together.

1831
00:53:37,410 --> 00:53:39,000
That's the way she fired herself up.

1832
00:53:39,870 --> 00:53:40,780
She Carlos bars,

1833
00:53:40,781 --> 00:53:41,614
we'll walk out.

1834
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:45,270
She walks out with like
zero emotion on her face.

1835
00:53:45,271 --> 00:53:45,451
Like,

1836
00:53:45,451 --> 00:53:46,740
is this girl ready to go?

1837
00:53:46,741 --> 00:53:47,790
She gets in the cage,

1838
00:53:47,791 --> 00:53:52,290
walks over one side and just stands there
and doesn't bounce around at all that

1839
00:53:52,350 --> 00:53:52,621
you know,

1840
00:53:52,621 --> 00:53:52,791
hey,

1841
00:53:52,791 --> 00:53:53,550
you see both,

1842
00:53:53,550 --> 00:53:54,320
both of them,

1843
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:54,540
you know,

1844
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:56,010
can have success doing that way.

1845
00:53:56,011 --> 00:53:56,640
Dealing with,

1846
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:57,473
you know,

1847
00:53:58,250 --> 00:53:59,400
it's amazing to see it.

1848
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:00,900
There's a groove that they get into,

1849
00:54:00,901 --> 00:54:01,350
they get,

1850
00:54:01,350 --> 00:54:02,700
they get in the comfort zone.

1851
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:03,361
They just like,

1852
00:54:03,361 --> 00:54:04,051
this is what I do.

1853
00:54:04,051 --> 00:54:06,960
Every time I've compete and
everybody's is different.

1854
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:07,591
And you know,

1855
00:54:07,591 --> 00:54:09,360
some people don't like to bounce around.

1856
00:54:09,361 --> 00:54:12,600
But I remember when Holly did that
during the Ronda Rousey fight.

1857
00:54:12,630 --> 00:54:14,550
I remember how I was looking at her.

1858
00:54:14,551 --> 00:54:15,030
I'm like,

1859
00:54:15,030 --> 00:54:16,860
this girl's got some legs.

1860
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:17,731
I was like,

1861
00:54:17,731 --> 00:54:20,700
I'd seen her fight before and I
knew that she was and some stamina.

1862
00:54:20,701 --> 00:54:20,941
I mean,

1863
00:54:20,941 --> 00:54:25,590
between the 10 minutes backstage before
she walked out the five minutes after

1864
00:54:25,591 --> 00:54:30,591
she was in the cage and Cyborg is walking
out the 10 or 15 seconds between every

1865
00:54:30,601 --> 00:54:30,871
round.

1866
00:54:30,871 --> 00:54:31,704
She probably,

1867
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:32,370
you know,

1868
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:33,210
ran a couple of miles.

1869
00:54:33,211 --> 00:54:33,300
Yeah.

1870
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:35,400
The equivalent of a couple
extra rounds and she was,

1871
00:54:35,410 --> 00:54:35,730
yeah,

1872
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:36,800
she was as fresh at the end of,

1873
00:54:36,801 --> 00:54:38,400
she wasn't beginning tremendous cardio.

1874
00:54:38,401 --> 00:54:38,880
And that girl,

1875
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:39,241
well,

1876
00:54:39,241 --> 00:54:40,740
Jackson's camp,

1877
00:54:40,770 --> 00:54:41,740
you know that Michael,

1878
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:42,753
uh,

1879
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:43,241
excuse me,

1880
00:54:43,241 --> 00:54:43,950
the uh,

1881
00:54:43,950 --> 00:54:46,380
Greg Jackson and Mike Winkeljohn camp,

1882
00:54:46,410 --> 00:54:46,760
they,

1883
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:49,770
they spend a lot of time
working on endurance training,

1884
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:51,840
strength and conditioning and
they do a lot of hill running.

1885
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:52,471
You know,

1886
00:54:52,471 --> 00:54:55,350
they have this famous mountain
that they run that they all do.

1887
00:54:55,351 --> 00:54:58,950
And just Holly's been known
for not just her cardio,

1888
00:54:58,951 --> 00:55:00,840
but like I said in the Rhonda fight,

1889
00:55:01,050 --> 00:55:01,831
her legs,

1890
00:55:01,831 --> 00:55:02,880
the way she can move.

1891
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:03,110
Yeah.

1892
00:55:03,110 --> 00:55:03,490
I,

1893
00:55:03,490 --> 00:55:05,700
that's one of the things that I thought
was going to be a big problem with her.

1894
00:55:05,701 --> 00:55:06,211
With Rhonda.

1895
00:55:06,211 --> 00:55:07,890
It was like Ron has got to catch her,

1896
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:10,410
like the way she's bouncing and moving.

1897
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:12,180
I don't think Rhonda can move like that.

1898
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:16,790
I'm like watching her bouncing move and
that crazy kickboxing style that she'd

1899
00:55:16,791 --> 00:55:19,590
had for all those years or ability
to do back flips and stuff.

1900
00:55:19,591 --> 00:55:20,460
She's really athletic.

1901
00:55:20,461 --> 00:55:22,680
She's a different
different level of athlete.

1902
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:23,573
Yup.

1903
00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:24,361
Yeah.

1904
00:55:24,361 --> 00:55:26,190
But cyberark is just too big,

1905
00:55:26,610 --> 00:55:27,031
too big,

1906
00:55:27,031 --> 00:55:29,160
too skillful to tough show.

1907
00:55:29,161 --> 00:55:29,910
She showed a lot.

1908
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:31,350
She showed a lot of skill in that fight.

1909
00:55:31,351 --> 00:55:31,501
I was,

1910
00:55:31,501 --> 00:55:32,160
you know,

1911
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:33,420
her previous UFC fights,

1912
00:55:33,421 --> 00:55:35,390
she was just kind of
coming at people and mall.

1913
00:55:35,410 --> 00:55:37,920
I thought she was really
skillfulness five very,

1914
00:55:38,130 --> 00:55:39,000
very patient too.

1915
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:39,630
You know.

1916
00:55:39,630 --> 00:55:42,540
I mean a lot of people want to
say that she's just a brute,

1917
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:45,330
but she's not like she's,

1918
00:55:45,331 --> 00:55:45,780
she's,

1919
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:47,760
she knows what her skills arm,

1920
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:51,130
which is big power and excellent Moy Tai.

1921
00:55:51,330 --> 00:55:53,850
But she also administered that power.

1922
00:55:53,851 --> 00:55:56,370
The way she delivered
it was very skillful,

1923
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:56,970
very,

1924
00:55:56,970 --> 00:55:58,140
very methodical,

1925
00:55:58,170 --> 00:55:59,250
very professional.

1926
00:55:59,490 --> 00:56:01,810
And that was a workman like really was.

1927
00:56:01,811 --> 00:56:04,560
It was initially I talked to somebody
in our camp and they wanted to see a

1928
00:56:04,561 --> 00:56:06,790
little bit more of that
brute power come right out.

1929
00:56:06,791 --> 00:56:09,200
And they thought she was
holding back a little bit.

1930
00:56:09,210 --> 00:56:11,310
Maybe a little too skillful,

1931
00:56:11,610 --> 00:56:12,900
but I thought it was great.

1932
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:14,580
While they want her to stop,

1933
00:56:14,890 --> 00:56:15,390
you know,

1934
00:56:15,390 --> 00:56:16,051
a Holly,

1935
00:56:16,051 --> 00:56:17,880
but you running the risky,

1936
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:18,753
getting head kicked.

1937
00:56:18,810 --> 00:56:19,230
Sure.

1938
00:56:19,230 --> 00:56:19,441
You know,

1939
00:56:19,441 --> 00:56:22,500
you gotta be real careful with Holly
Holly pull stuff out of our ass.

1940
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:22,801
You know,

1941
00:56:22,801 --> 00:56:25,290
like he sat in the drain and
Germane to random he phi,

1942
00:56:25,291 --> 00:56:27,100
he saw it and obviously the Rhonda fight,

1943
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:28,810
she needs very sneaky.

1944
00:56:28,811 --> 00:56:29,411
She knows how to,

1945
00:56:29,411 --> 00:56:30,850
especially that left high kick man.

1946
00:56:30,851 --> 00:56:32,180
She knows how to sneak down such a great,

1947
00:56:32,410 --> 00:56:33,340
that was a great fight.

1948
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:34,330
Love watching that fight.

1949
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:35,150
Yeah.

1950
00:56:35,150 --> 00:56:35,370
Yeah.

1951
00:56:35,370 --> 00:56:40,260
The women's MMA talent level
has risen and risen and it,

1952
00:56:40,290 --> 00:56:40,900
it is,

1953
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:41,171
I mean,

1954
00:56:41,171 --> 00:56:45,370
I remember when it first came on the
scene and Rhonda was the champ and she was

1955
00:56:45,371 --> 00:56:49,210
just kind of roll in these girls who
really didn't belong in the ring with her.

1956
00:56:49,970 --> 00:56:51,670
It how it has and you know,

1957
00:56:51,671 --> 00:56:52,330
interesting.

1958
00:56:52,330 --> 00:56:54,130
Bringing back to the
performance institute,

1959
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:54,370
you know,

1960
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:58,090
talk with guys a lot over there that
what they're finding out is you need to

1961
00:56:58,091 --> 00:57:02,920
train a female athlete in a much different
manner than you train a male athlete.

1962
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:04,120
Um,

1963
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:04,331
you know,

1964
00:57:04,331 --> 00:57:07,270
you see a lot of times when
female athletes cut weight,

1965
00:57:07,271 --> 00:57:08,860
difficult difficulties,

1966
00:57:08,861 --> 00:57:10,600
they have cutting that way because of,

1967
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:10,900
you know,

1968
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:12,400
menstrual cycles potentially.

1969
00:57:12,401 --> 00:57:14,500
And you also see in a lot of cases,

1970
00:57:14,501 --> 00:57:18,070
a rebound effect where
a female will fight,

1971
00:57:18,071 --> 00:57:18,761
get down to weight,

1972
00:57:18,761 --> 00:57:19,091
fight,

1973
00:57:19,091 --> 00:57:22,240
and then bounce way back up
and just lose the ability,

1974
00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:26,140
the body's ability to regulate where
there'll be cutting down on calories

1975
00:57:26,141 --> 00:57:28,540
working out like crazy and
they're still putting on weight.

1976
00:57:29,230 --> 00:57:29,890
Um,

1977
00:57:29,890 --> 00:57:30,270
so I mean,

1978
00:57:30,270 --> 00:57:33,460
I think that's something that you'll see
the performance institute doing is try

1979
00:57:33,461 --> 00:57:33,800
to,

1980
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:34,180
you know,

1981
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:38,740
figure out and then knowledgeability
disseminate information about how to train

1982
00:57:38,741 --> 00:57:42,760
the female athlete that they may need
a little bit more time off and recovery

1983
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:44,890
between fights than a male athlete will.

1984
00:57:44,891 --> 00:57:46,600
But one thing I say,

1985
00:57:46,601 --> 00:57:50,830
time and time again is every
time we have a female fight,

1986
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:52,090
they come to fight.

1987
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:53,950
And you often see cards that are,

1988
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:54,670
you know,

1989
00:57:54,670 --> 00:57:56,910
kind of lagging a little bit
and you look down on the list,

1990
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:57,530
okay,

1991
00:57:57,530 --> 00:57:58,640
there comes a female fight,

1992
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:02,140
boom turns the car and ride
around because you know,

1993
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:03,460
inevitably they,

1994
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:06,370
they give ultimate
maximum effort in there.

1995
00:58:06,390 --> 00:58:07,330
That's at least what I see.

1996
00:58:07,630 --> 00:58:08,380
There's a lot of that.

1997
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:08,531
Well,

1998
00:58:08,531 --> 00:58:09,060
there's the,

1999
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:09,893
the t,

2000
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:10,301
excuse me,

2001
00:58:10,301 --> 00:58:13,390
the talent level is rising.

2002
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:14,790
They're very hungry and they're,

2003
00:58:14,791 --> 00:58:16,960
they're looking to be that next person.

2004
00:58:16,961 --> 00:58:17,794
They realize like,

2005
00:58:17,890 --> 00:58:18,221
look,

2006
00:58:18,221 --> 00:58:19,600
Ronda Rousey is gone.

2007
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:21,700
No one has really filled her place.

2008
00:58:21,850 --> 00:58:23,650
I mean there's some very popular fighters,

2009
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:23,981
you know,

2010
00:58:23,981 --> 00:58:27,400
like a rose Nama units obviously now
is going to be one of the most popular

2011
00:58:27,401 --> 00:58:30,280
fighters after the knock out of
you on e and j check cyborgs,

2012
00:58:30,281 --> 00:58:31,240
obviously very popular,

2013
00:58:31,241 --> 00:58:33,650
but there's plenty of room for
more and they realize that,

2014
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:34,061
look,

2015
00:58:34,061 --> 00:58:35,230
this is the time to go for it.

2016
00:58:35,710 --> 00:58:36,580
And I just think that,

2017
00:58:37,090 --> 00:58:37,331
you know,

2018
00:58:37,331 --> 00:58:40,000
the women that get involved in
fighting in the first place,

2019
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:41,020
it's not,

2020
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:42,820
there's a lot of men that
get involved in fighting.

2021
00:58:42,821 --> 00:58:44,290
They're not going to fight after awhile.

2022
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:46,150
But women that get involved in fighting,

2023
00:58:46,151 --> 00:58:47,410
they tend to be crazy,

2024
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:48,401
like in,

2025
00:58:48,401 --> 00:58:49,270
in a good way.

2026
00:58:49,330 --> 00:58:49,631
You know,

2027
00:58:49,631 --> 00:58:51,160
like these are wild women,

2028
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:51,391
you know,

2029
00:58:51,391 --> 00:58:53,260
like cats in Ghana type characters.

2030
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:53,891
You know,

2031
00:58:53,891 --> 00:58:54,970
they're just wild.

2032
00:58:55,030 --> 00:58:56,500
And like when you watch them fight,

2033
00:58:56,501 --> 00:58:56,640
I mean,

2034
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:56,841
you,

2035
00:58:56,841 --> 00:58:58,060
you're going to see some chaos.

2036
00:58:58,090 --> 00:58:58,360
I mean,

2037
00:58:58,360 --> 00:58:58,551
they're,

2038
00:58:58,551 --> 00:58:59,890
they're not going to be playing it safe.

2039
00:59:00,010 --> 00:59:01,150
They're going to be going for it.

2040
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:01,450
Yeah.

2041
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:02,283
I love that about him.

2042
00:59:02,650 --> 00:59:02,980
Now,

2043
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:06,730
cat is an interesting example because
she was telling me the exact same thing

2044
00:59:06,731 --> 00:59:08,500
that you were saying
that with a lot of women,

2045
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:12,850
their body responds very poorly to the
weight cut and then immediately wants to

2046
00:59:12,851 --> 00:59:13,720
gain weight afterwards.

2047
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:14,050
Yep.

2048
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:15,250
Do you think that that's a,

2049
00:59:15,251 --> 00:59:16,700
some sort of a,

2050
00:59:16,701 --> 00:59:16,870
uh,

2051
00:59:16,870 --> 00:59:18,870
like an evolutionary
feature because of their,

2052
00:59:18,950 --> 00:59:22,940
the fact that they carry babies and
Mckinney they need fat so thereby freaks

2053
00:59:22,941 --> 00:59:23,250
out?

2054
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:24,200
I've definitely thought that.

2055
00:59:24,201 --> 00:59:24,680
Sure.

2056
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:26,180
Or some sort of a response.

2057
00:59:26,181 --> 00:59:26,781
Like your body's like,

2058
00:59:26,781 --> 00:59:27,110
Hey,

2059
00:59:27,110 --> 00:59:30,010
I don't know what this crazy person is
doing but we've got to put some fat on.

2060
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:30,681
Absolutely.

2061
00:59:30,681 --> 00:59:31,101
And that's,

2062
00:59:31,101 --> 00:59:31,311
you know,

2063
00:59:31,311 --> 00:59:33,890
that's something we're again going
back to the performance institute that

2064
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:34,953
they're their,

2065
00:59:35,070 --> 00:59:39,020
their dive in deep into and
Clinton Wattenberg especially
on the nutrition side

2066
00:59:39,021 --> 00:59:39,590
that,

2067
00:59:39,590 --> 00:59:39,861
you know,

2068
00:59:39,861 --> 00:59:42,260
seeing those endocrine
profiles after a fight,

2069
00:59:42,650 --> 00:59:42,891
you know,

2070
00:59:42,891 --> 00:59:45,870
what can you do both and cutting
back and training and you know,

2071
00:59:45,890 --> 00:59:46,580
through your,

2072
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:49,550
through your diet to help
control and regulate that.

2073
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:53,540
And Kat was telling me about a
program that you guys were just,

2074
00:59:53,541 --> 00:59:58,070
you were just mentioning briefly in San
Diego where they're using some sort of

2075
00:59:58,071 --> 01:00:01,760
magnetic frequencies on fighters
that have had brain injuries.

2076
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:02,180
Like what,

2077
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:03,013
what is this?

2078
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:03,411
Yeah,

2079
01:00:03,411 --> 01:00:07,130
what was something that the doctor Dunkin
French kind of brought into the mix

2080
01:00:07,131 --> 01:00:07,550
here?

2081
01:00:07,550 --> 01:00:07,911
Um,

2082
01:00:07,911 --> 01:00:10,100
so previous come into UFC,

2083
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:13,910
he was director of sports performance at
University of Notre Dame in south bend,

2084
01:00:13,911 --> 01:00:14,744
Indiana.

2085
01:00:14,930 --> 01:00:16,940
And they were looking into,

2086
01:00:17,090 --> 01:00:17,810
um,

2087
01:00:17,810 --> 01:00:18,111
you know,

2088
01:00:18,111 --> 01:00:21,740
traumatic brain injury and
football and possible therapy.

2089
01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:22,490
Um,

2090
01:00:22,490 --> 01:00:26,270
and they came across a clinic in San
Diego that was using this therapy and FDA

2091
01:00:26,271 --> 01:00:27,081
approved device.

2092
01:00:27,081 --> 01:00:30,290
It's basically low level magnet therapy,

2093
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:31,310
um,

2094
01:00:31,310 --> 01:00:32,480
in conjunction with that,

2095
01:00:32,481 --> 01:00:36,470
they do some EKG or reading of
the electrical waves in the brain.

2096
01:00:36,890 --> 01:00:38,180
And you know,

2097
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:38,570
uh,

2098
01:00:38,570 --> 01:00:42,410
initially we're finding that this therapy
was bringing some of those readings

2099
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:44,540
back together and,

2100
01:00:44,541 --> 01:00:44,721
uh,

2101
01:00:44,721 --> 01:00:45,950
I think very early,

2102
01:00:46,130 --> 01:00:46,963
um,

2103
01:00:47,050 --> 01:00:47,500
in,

2104
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:50,690
in the process of figuring out
whether this can really work or not.

2105
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:51,381
But you know,

2106
01:00:51,381 --> 01:00:55,460
certainly with the UFC wants to be as
ahead of the curve in terms of potential

2107
01:00:55,461 --> 01:00:56,870
therapies out there for,

2108
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:57,740
um,

2109
01:00:57,740 --> 01:00:57,981
you know,

2110
01:00:57,981 --> 01:00:59,000
for treating the brain.

2111
01:00:59,390 --> 01:01:00,200
Um,

2112
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:00,980
and so,

2113
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:01,370
uh,

2114
01:01:01,370 --> 01:01:01,581
yeah,

2115
01:01:01,581 --> 01:01:03,980
cat's been going there for a while and um,

2116
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:04,551
you know,

2117
01:01:04,551 --> 01:01:05,510
as I said,

2118
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:07,640
she says she's experienced
some positive results.

2119
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:08,211
Yeah.

2120
01:01:08,211 --> 01:01:08,630
She's,

2121
01:01:08,630 --> 01:01:10,400
she told me she got some
outstanding results.

2122
01:01:10,401 --> 01:01:15,401
And what's interesting is there's been
a ton of research and studies done on

2123
01:01:15,470 --> 01:01:16,880
transdermal stimulation,

2124
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:17,780
all these different,

2125
01:01:17,780 --> 01:01:17,990
uh,

2126
01:01:17,990 --> 01:01:19,210
ways to increase the,

2127
01:01:19,230 --> 01:01:20,780
the brain's ability to learn.

2128
01:01:21,530 --> 01:01:22,400
And um,

2129
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:24,890
there was a radio lab podcast on this,

2130
01:01:24,891 --> 01:01:27,170
I think it was called
something nine volts,

2131
01:01:27,171 --> 01:01:29,030
if you could find at nine
volts something or another.

2132
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:34,010
But it basically detailed how they
use this for a sniper simulation.

2133
01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:37,340
And what they did is they took
this woman who was a reporter,

2134
01:01:38,290 --> 01:01:38,720
um,

2135
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:41,780
they put her through this
sniper simulation games,

2136
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:42,650
like a video game.

2137
01:01:42,890 --> 01:01:44,870
She scored poorly and then,

2138
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:45,111
yeah,

2139
01:01:45,111 --> 01:01:46,130
nine volt Nirvana.

2140
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:46,993
Thank you Jamie.

2141
01:01:47,150 --> 01:01:52,150
And so then they attach these electrodes
to various areas of her head and

2142
01:01:53,271 --> 01:01:56,510
stimulated her brain with a small charge.

2143
01:01:56,780 --> 01:02:01,280
And she went through the exact same
thing and she said it felt like the 20

2144
01:02:01,281 --> 01:02:03,860
minutes went by in two minutes and her,

2145
01:02:03,890 --> 01:02:05,150
her score was perfect.

2146
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:10,720
And this is being echoed throughout like
many different people that have done

2147
01:02:11,421 --> 01:02:13,220
tests on these very,

2148
01:02:13,221 --> 01:02:16,730
and there's a lot of like home hacking
where people are literally going to radio

2149
01:02:16,731 --> 01:02:18,320
lab and making their own setups.

2150
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:19,980
But I'm curious to

2151
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:22,530
see if the UFC has looked
into some of these things.

2152
01:02:22,531 --> 01:02:27,531
Like some like maybe perhaps there's
a way you could stimulate the body's

2153
01:02:27,721 --> 01:02:32,721
ability to learn certain techniques or
like carve pathways by stimulating areas

2154
01:02:33,391 --> 01:02:33,980
of the brain.

2155
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:34,201
Yeah,

2156
01:02:34,201 --> 01:02:34,650
man.

2157
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:37,680
Another great reason for you to get
Duncan in here because he can talk real

2158
01:02:37,681 --> 01:02:38,970
knowledge to be about this therapy.

2159
01:02:38,971 --> 01:02:41,100
He told me when at the
University of Notre Dame,

2160
01:02:41,101 --> 01:02:41,311
you know,

2161
01:02:41,311 --> 01:02:42,060
they'd have,

2162
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:43,200
they've had football players,

2163
01:02:43,201 --> 01:02:43,530
it would,

2164
01:02:43,530 --> 01:02:43,921
you know,

2165
01:02:43,921 --> 01:02:48,750
have migraine headaches for long periods
of time than under what this therapy in

2166
01:02:48,751 --> 01:02:49,740
a matter of weeks they were,

2167
01:02:49,770 --> 01:02:50,603
they went away.

2168
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:51,630
Um,

2169
01:02:51,630 --> 01:02:54,300
when Donna and I visited the
facility down in San Diego,

2170
01:02:54,301 --> 01:02:55,230
they talked about,

2171
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:55,920
uh,

2172
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:57,330
employees of the facility,

2173
01:02:57,331 --> 01:02:58,800
bringing in their kids,

2174
01:02:59,370 --> 01:03:04,370
a kids that had some levels of autism
that after this therapy were more engaging

2175
01:03:04,561 --> 01:03:05,394
with people.

2176
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:10,580
They also talked about kids that had
tests or finals coming up the day after

2177
01:03:10,590 --> 01:03:14,580
where they go in for this therapy the
night before and get their test scores

2178
01:03:14,581 --> 01:03:16,350
were improving as a result.

2179
01:03:16,630 --> 01:03:17,070
Um,

2180
01:03:17,070 --> 01:03:17,851
it was a lot of,

2181
01:03:17,851 --> 01:03:21,450
they deal with a lot of special forces
soldiers down in the San Diego area that

2182
01:03:21,451 --> 01:03:23,640
have had traumatic brain
injuries because of,

2183
01:03:23,670 --> 01:03:24,060
you know,

2184
01:03:24,060 --> 01:03:26,090
ids and a,

2185
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:27,330
I've seen some success there.

2186
01:03:27,331 --> 01:03:27,961
So I mean,

2187
01:03:27,961 --> 01:03:31,380
I think some real exciting
potential there that again,

2188
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:31,861
you know,

2189
01:03:31,861 --> 01:03:35,100
the UFC wants to be at the
forefront of and you know,

2190
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:36,210
be the first to,

2191
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:36,990
you know,

2192
01:03:36,990 --> 01:03:40,170
to suggest some of these things
for our athletes and you know,

2193
01:03:40,171 --> 01:03:41,210
potentially even looking,

2194
01:03:41,230 --> 01:03:43,260
getting some of these devices at the Pi,

2195
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:44,453
um,

2196
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:46,410
and be able to treat some
of our athletes there.

2197
01:03:46,830 --> 01:03:47,130
Yeah,

2198
01:03:47,130 --> 01:03:48,090
that would be amazing.

2199
01:03:48,091 --> 01:03:51,480
And I think that we're in an
interesting time now where,

2200
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:55,680
because so much research is being put
on CTE and traumatic brain injuries that

2201
01:03:55,681 --> 01:03:56,071
were,

2202
01:03:56,071 --> 01:04:01,071
we're looking at potential
ways to mitigate those
problems and maybe even rehab

2203
01:04:02,820 --> 01:04:04,530
some of the issues that
fighters of having.

2204
01:04:04,650 --> 01:04:04,981
Yeah.

2205
01:04:04,981 --> 01:04:05,371
So,

2206
01:04:05,371 --> 01:04:05,580
uh,

2207
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:07,790
one thing we didn't show
you and your tour is a,

2208
01:04:07,830 --> 01:04:11,310
we now make part of the
onboarding process at the Pi,

2209
01:04:11,311 --> 01:04:12,930
the c three logic testing,

2210
01:04:12,931 --> 01:04:13,830
which is this,

2211
01:04:13,870 --> 01:04:14,140
you know,

2212
01:04:14,140 --> 01:04:15,030
25,

2213
01:04:15,031 --> 01:04:19,260
30 minute neurocognitive tests that came
out of the Cleveland Clinic brain study

2214
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:21,840
and it's an iPad based tests.

2215
01:04:21,930 --> 01:04:22,470
Um,

2216
01:04:22,470 --> 01:04:24,150
it's a mix of memory,

2217
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:25,051
shape,

2218
01:04:25,051 --> 01:04:25,920
recognition,

2219
01:04:25,980 --> 01:04:26,521
balance.

2220
01:04:26,521 --> 01:04:27,290
You actually,

2221
01:04:27,290 --> 01:04:27,511
you know,

2222
01:04:27,511 --> 01:04:28,710
put the pad on your,

2223
01:04:28,950 --> 01:04:29,740
onto a belt,

2224
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:34,050
you stand on this unstable surface and
close your eyes and it basically gives

2225
01:04:34,051 --> 01:04:36,990
you measurements or readings
after 25 or 30 minutes.

2226
01:04:37,410 --> 01:04:38,070
And then,

2227
01:04:38,070 --> 01:04:38,341
you know,

2228
01:04:38,341 --> 01:04:40,320
over time you can compare those readings.

2229
01:04:40,321 --> 01:04:41,190
If they're declining,

2230
01:04:41,191 --> 01:04:43,320
maybe it's time to take a
little bit of time off from,

2231
01:04:43,350 --> 01:04:44,460
from training and fighting.

2232
01:04:44,850 --> 01:04:45,241
Um,

2233
01:04:45,241 --> 01:04:46,260
if they're staying stable,

2234
01:04:46,261 --> 01:04:46,950
then you know,

2235
01:04:46,950 --> 01:04:47,371
maybe you know,

2236
01:04:47,371 --> 01:04:48,204
you're doing all right.

2237
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:52,050
The California Athletic Commission
requires that for all fights.

2238
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:54,840
So all fighters in any card in California,

2239
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:58,410
the Wednesday or Thursday before the
fight goes through the c three logic

2240
01:04:58,411 --> 01:04:59,244
testing,

2241
01:04:59,310 --> 01:05:00,900
all of it's uploaded to a cloud.

2242
01:05:00,901 --> 01:05:01,570
So you don't,

2243
01:05:01,570 --> 01:05:03,570
after a period of a couple of years,

2244
01:05:03,930 --> 01:05:04,530
um,

2245
01:05:04,530 --> 01:05:08,400
a fighter can have access to
some real objective data on,

2246
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:08,701
you know,

2247
01:05:08,701 --> 01:05:13,290
with the neuro cognitive capabilities are
looking like that would be a great way

2248
01:05:13,291 --> 01:05:14,101
to find out.

2249
01:05:14,101 --> 01:05:17,530
I mean maybe one of the only ways to
find out without fighter to declaw

2250
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:18,040
disclosing

2251
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:18,191
it,

2252
01:05:18,191 --> 01:05:21,910
whether or not a fighter has been
knocked out in camp because that,

2253
01:05:21,911 --> 01:05:26,770
that's a common occurrence that fighters
get knocked out in camp and hard

2254
01:05:26,771 --> 01:05:28,660
sparring and then a week,

2255
01:05:28,690 --> 01:05:32,560
two weeks later have to fight and
their ability to take a shot is gone.

2256
01:05:32,650 --> 01:05:33,483
Sure.

2257
01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:33,791
Yeah.

2258
01:05:33,791 --> 01:05:34,331
It's interesting,

2259
01:05:34,331 --> 01:05:34,730
you know,

2260
01:05:34,730 --> 01:05:37,990
often asked about that and comparing
it to other sports leagues.

2261
01:05:37,991 --> 01:05:39,310
And the one thing I will say,

2262
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:39,851
you know,

2263
01:05:39,851 --> 01:05:42,790
with Nma now this is excluding
things are going on in the gym,

2264
01:05:42,820 --> 01:05:45,790
but in a fight that's regulated
by the Athletic Commission,

2265
01:05:45,791 --> 01:05:46,624
I think.

2266
01:05:46,660 --> 01:05:50,190
And then may have some of the most
conservative return to play policy.

2267
01:05:50,290 --> 01:05:52,330
I know it does have any sport we're in.

2268
01:05:52,780 --> 01:05:56,080
If you're an NFL quarterback and
you get knocked out on a Sunday,

2269
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:56,981
yeah,

2270
01:05:56,981 --> 01:05:58,420
you're in a concussion protocol,

2271
01:05:58,421 --> 01:06:01,810
but they're trying to get you back plan
probably the next Sunday or the Sunday

2272
01:06:01,811 --> 01:06:02,440
thereafter,

2273
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:03,130
which is crazy.

2274
01:06:03,130 --> 01:06:05,110
The big concussion and MMA as you know,

2275
01:06:05,111 --> 01:06:08,560
there's like a 45 60 mandatory 45 days,

2276
01:06:08,561 --> 01:06:09,331
no activities,

2277
01:06:09,331 --> 01:06:10,690
60 days before you fight.

2278
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:10,901
I mean,

2279
01:06:10,901 --> 01:06:12,970
we've seen suspensions out to six months,

2280
01:06:12,971 --> 01:06:14,560
mandatory medical suspension.

2281
01:06:14,561 --> 01:06:15,010
So,

2282
01:06:15,010 --> 01:06:16,840
and some of them I think
are very warranted.

2283
01:06:16,870 --> 01:06:20,320
I mean there's some brutal brutal
knockouts where like Alistair Overeem and

2284
01:06:20,321 --> 01:06:21,760
Francis and [inaudible] like,

2285
01:06:21,761 --> 01:06:23,590
I don't want to see
Alistair fight next month.

2286
01:06:23,650 --> 01:06:24,131
You know what I mean?

2287
01:06:24,131 --> 01:06:24,940
I don't,

2288
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:27,310
and here's a question
about a guy like Allister,

2289
01:06:28,540 --> 01:06:29,081
Allister,

2290
01:06:29,081 --> 01:06:34,081
we looked it up one day on a podcast has
been stopped or knocked out somewhere

2291
01:06:35,111 --> 01:06:39,580
in the neighborhood of 13 times in MMA
and then three times more in kickboxing.

2292
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:41,133
What,

2293
01:06:41,230 --> 01:06:43,000
what's the number where you like,

2294
01:06:43,001 --> 01:06:43,830
that's enough.

2295
01:06:43,830 --> 01:06:44,350
Yeah,

2296
01:06:44,350 --> 01:06:45,400
I don't know the answer to that.

2297
01:06:45,910 --> 01:06:46,450
Um,

2298
01:06:46,450 --> 01:06:49,300
I know you talked with Allister
and Scott and his wits about him.

2299
01:06:49,301 --> 01:06:50,140
That's what's crazy.

2300
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:52,170
Allister doesn't even
seem remotely punching.

2301
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:52,481
I mean,

2302
01:06:52,481 --> 01:06:54,280
he is not only that,

2303
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:55,960
he doesn't seem deterred,

2304
01:06:56,560 --> 01:06:57,580
like it's crazy.

2305
01:06:57,581 --> 01:06:58,900
Like he gets knocked out and he's like,

2306
01:06:58,930 --> 01:06:59,260
well,

2307
01:06:59,260 --> 01:07:01,230
we go back to the drawing board and uh,

2308
01:07:01,270 --> 01:07:02,140
we'll be better next time.

2309
01:07:02,141 --> 01:07:02,830
Like,

2310
01:07:02,830 --> 01:07:03,850
I think it's an unknown now.

2311
01:07:03,851 --> 01:07:04,631
But you also look at,

2312
01:07:04,631 --> 01:07:04,811
you know,

2313
01:07:04,811 --> 01:07:08,320
the UFC has been the largest contributor
to the Cleveland Clinic fight or brain

2314
01:07:08,321 --> 01:07:09,100
health study.

2315
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:09,850
So we,

2316
01:07:09,850 --> 01:07:10,220
you know,

2317
01:07:10,220 --> 01:07:12,850
made I think multimillion
dollar commitment.

2318
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:13,090
Uh,

2319
01:07:13,090 --> 01:07:14,530
we've upped it once.

2320
01:07:14,890 --> 01:07:15,430
Um,

2321
01:07:15,430 --> 01:07:15,881
so yeah,

2322
01:07:15,881 --> 01:07:19,360
we're looking to invest resources into
finding out what those answers are

2323
01:07:19,361 --> 01:07:19,901
definitely.

2324
01:07:19,901 --> 01:07:23,590
And be at the forefront of any
innovative therapies that are out there.

2325
01:07:23,591 --> 01:07:24,250
Innovative,

2326
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:24,461
you know,

2327
01:07:24,461 --> 01:07:24,851
testing.

2328
01:07:24,851 --> 01:07:25,684
It's out there.

2329
01:07:25,990 --> 01:07:26,823
We want to be at the front.

2330
01:07:27,130 --> 01:07:27,281
Well,

2331
01:07:27,281 --> 01:07:27,381
the,

2332
01:07:27,381 --> 01:07:32,381
the issue with CTE is that you really
can't test for it until after a fighters

2333
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:33,041
dead.

2334
01:07:33,041 --> 01:07:33,461
Correct.

2335
01:07:33,461 --> 01:07:38,080
But haven't they recently figured out a
way to test people while they're alive?

2336
01:07:38,110 --> 01:07:38,381
Yeah,

2337
01:07:38,381 --> 01:07:38,521
I'm,

2338
01:07:38,521 --> 01:07:39,311
I've read some of that.

2339
01:07:39,311 --> 01:07:41,260
I've also read that
scientists arguing that,

2340
01:07:41,261 --> 01:07:41,650
that,

2341
01:07:41,650 --> 01:07:42,190
you know,

2342
01:07:42,190 --> 01:07:43,600
that's fine and that's not right.

2343
01:07:43,601 --> 01:07:45,130
So I don't know where we're at on that.

2344
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:46,241
Yeah.

2345
01:07:46,241 --> 01:07:47,380
Because boy,

2346
01:07:47,410 --> 01:07:48,460
it just seems like

2347
01:07:50,170 --> 01:07:51,390
I don't want to end.

2348
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:52,990
It also affects people differently,

2349
01:07:52,991 --> 01:07:53,351
right.

2350
01:07:53,351 --> 01:07:55,060
Depending upon what genes they have,

2351
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:58,360
some people are more predisposed to CTE.

2352
01:07:58,910 --> 01:07:59,291
Yeah.

2353
01:07:59,291 --> 01:07:59,860
And that's,

2354
01:07:59,860 --> 01:08:00,880
that's my understanding of it.

2355
01:08:00,881 --> 01:08:01,211
Again,

2356
01:08:01,211 --> 01:08:02,290
a lot of unknowns.

2357
01:08:02,291 --> 01:08:03,190
But um,

2358
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:03,491
you know,

2359
01:08:03,491 --> 01:08:07,330
I think that the UFC has
shown a dedication to,

2360
01:08:07,380 --> 01:08:07,660
you know,

2361
01:08:07,660 --> 01:08:10,090
contributing to areas where we can
find out some of those answers.

2362
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:11,410
Yeah.

2363
01:08:11,410 --> 01:08:12,243
Um,

2364
01:08:12,670 --> 01:08:17,670
like I know that you guys recently had
mark come to Vegas because Mark Han had

2365
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:21,680
talked about suffering damage
from fights in the UFC.

2366
01:08:21,690 --> 01:08:21,921
Said,

2367
01:08:21,921 --> 01:08:22,270
you know what?

2368
01:08:22,270 --> 01:08:25,550
We can just hear him say that we're
going to pull them off this card.

2369
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:26,960
And he was furious and they said,

2370
01:08:26,961 --> 01:08:28,400
look like we love you,

2371
01:08:28,430 --> 01:08:29,300
don't get it wrong,

2372
01:08:29,690 --> 01:08:30,590
but we want you,

2373
01:08:30,650 --> 01:08:31,500
we want you to be safe.

2374
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:33,980
And you say that you're
slurring your words.

2375
01:08:33,981 --> 01:08:35,240
And then he changed it and said,

2376
01:08:35,241 --> 01:08:35,511
well,

2377
01:08:35,511 --> 01:08:37,580
it's after a few drinks
and then then went,

2378
01:08:37,581 --> 01:08:37,821
okay,

2379
01:08:37,821 --> 01:08:42,821
well come by and let's give you the full
gamut of tests as exact what happened.

2380
01:08:43,521 --> 01:08:46,040
And we're always going to act
out of an abundance of caution.

2381
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:47,570
And in a scenario like that.

2382
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:50,900
And so now he's back on the roster
and back with a fight scheduled.

2383
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:53,120
He's fighting in Perth and in February.

2384
01:08:53,510 --> 01:08:56,210
So when a guy says something like that,

2385
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:57,500
you just Kinda have to,

2386
01:08:57,950 --> 01:08:58,340
you have,

2387
01:08:58,340 --> 01:08:58,881
when a guy says,

2388
01:08:58,881 --> 01:08:59,930
I'm slurring my words,

2389
01:08:59,931 --> 01:09:00,260
I've been,

2390
01:09:00,260 --> 01:09:01,520
I've taken too much punishment.

2391
01:09:01,521 --> 01:09:01,760
Like,

2392
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:02,390
okay,

2393
01:09:02,390 --> 01:09:03,500
we've got a red flag here.

2394
01:09:03,590 --> 01:09:04,423
You have to,

2395
01:09:04,460 --> 01:09:04,641
right?

2396
01:09:04,641 --> 01:09:04,940
Yeah,

2397
01:09:04,940 --> 01:09:05,571
absolutely.

2398
01:09:05,571 --> 01:09:05,931
I mean,

2399
01:09:05,931 --> 01:09:06,471
that happened.

2400
01:09:06,471 --> 01:09:09,720
I looked back to on a few member
when Kane was gonna fight a,

2401
01:09:09,740 --> 01:09:11,220
at the end of last year asking,

2402
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:13,610
you came out a week or
two previous saying,

2403
01:09:13,611 --> 01:09:13,851
man,

2404
01:09:13,851 --> 01:09:16,100
I'm in so much pain from this back issue.

2405
01:09:16,580 --> 01:09:20,230
I'm having to use medical marijuana
CBD leading up to this fight.

2406
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:21,200
The only way I can train,

2407
01:09:21,201 --> 01:09:23,720
I'm going to have this surgery
directly after the fight.

2408
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:24,950
Um,

2409
01:09:24,950 --> 01:09:27,410
it was actually a Nevada
commission that saw this and said,

2410
01:09:27,470 --> 01:09:28,221
wait a second,

2411
01:09:28,221 --> 01:09:30,080
if you're really in that much pain,

2412
01:09:30,081 --> 01:09:33,140
like we can't with good conscience,

2413
01:09:33,190 --> 01:09:34,460
I'm license you to fight.

2414
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:39,520
And sure enough they didn't do that
and ended up having the surgery and uh,

2415
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:40,850
hopefully as back pretty soon.

2416
01:09:40,851 --> 01:09:41,840
But it's been like a year now.

2417
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:42,380
Yeah.

2418
01:09:42,380 --> 01:09:47,380
He's a guy that is almost too tough
for his body or maybe is to tougher his

2419
01:09:47,871 --> 01:09:48,201
body.

2420
01:09:48,201 --> 01:09:49,490
If you watch cane fight,

2421
01:09:49,491 --> 01:09:51,620
particularly early in his
career when he's in his prime,

2422
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:57,280
you just couldn't believe the amount of
endurance that a 240 pound man can have.

2423
01:09:57,730 --> 01:09:58,090
The,

2424
01:09:58,090 --> 01:10:02,690
the just the pace that he would put on
guys and you'd see them just drowning in

2425
01:10:02,691 --> 01:10:03,524
that pace.

2426
01:10:03,980 --> 01:10:05,480
But the only way you get,

2427
01:10:05,670 --> 01:10:10,370
I mean you have to have some physical
gifts cardiovascularly and I think Kane

2428
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:11,960
will admit that he has some,

2429
01:10:11,980 --> 01:10:12,140
uh,

2430
01:10:12,140 --> 01:10:13,730
some natural cardio,

2431
01:10:14,060 --> 01:10:17,600
but unbelievable work
ethic and mental toughness.

2432
01:10:17,601 --> 01:10:21,620
And that mental toughness also makes
you push through injuries and pushing

2433
01:10:21,621 --> 01:10:23,780
through injuries is how
injuries become chronic.

2434
01:10:23,781 --> 01:10:27,200
And that's how injuries become
unmanageable and require surgery.

2435
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:28,500
I mean you would know I,

2436
01:10:28,590 --> 01:10:28,731
I'm,

2437
01:10:28,731 --> 01:10:31,280
I was an athlete and went
through my share of injuries,

2438
01:10:31,281 --> 01:10:31,671
but you know,

2439
01:10:31,671 --> 01:10:34,790
I played basketball and ran
track and in those sports,

2440
01:10:34,850 --> 01:10:35,091
you know,

2441
01:10:35,091 --> 01:10:37,190
depending on your injury you can control,

2442
01:10:37,191 --> 01:10:39,170
I think your exposure
and protect your body.

2443
01:10:39,980 --> 01:10:40,251
I mean,

2444
01:10:40,251 --> 01:10:41,480
how do you do that in fighting?

2445
01:10:41,630 --> 01:10:42,030
You can't,

2446
01:10:42,030 --> 01:10:42,630
you can't,

2447
01:10:42,630 --> 01:10:43,463
you can't,

2448
01:10:43,490 --> 01:10:46,340
you can't prevent certain positions
that your lot you're going to be in.

2449
01:10:46,341 --> 01:10:48,050
And if you're not completely healthy,

2450
01:10:48,140 --> 01:10:51,680
you're going to be probably exposed
from the only thing you could drill.

2451
01:10:51,980 --> 01:10:52,311
I mean,

2452
01:10:52,311 --> 01:10:56,270
if you really injured and you have a
good opponent or a good training partner,

2453
01:10:56,271 --> 01:10:58,070
you can drill on certain things and say,

2454
01:10:58,071 --> 01:10:58,401
hey man,

2455
01:10:58,401 --> 01:11:01,010
you just can't touch my shoulder
but there's no way you can spar.

2456
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:06,230
And there's no way you could really
prepare for a fight without really hard

2457
01:11:06,231 --> 01:11:08,520
training and hard training with,

2458
01:11:08,540 --> 01:11:10,580
with injuries is virtually impossible.

2459
01:11:10,610 --> 01:11:11,280
I mean,

2460
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:11,680
we,

2461
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:12,590
with some injuries,

2462
01:11:12,620 --> 01:11:13,441
you know what I mean of them,

2463
01:11:13,441 --> 01:11:14,340
you can work around.

2464
01:11:14,410 --> 01:11:16,110
This is ways to figure
a way around things.

2465
01:11:16,111 --> 01:11:18,660
And that's one of the things that I've
found was really interesting also about

2466
01:11:18,661 --> 01:11:19,790
the UFC performances too,

2467
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:24,330
does there's a lot of different things
that you guys have devised or have,

2468
01:11:24,390 --> 01:11:24,670
you know,

2469
01:11:24,670 --> 01:11:28,170
you've guys are brought in and implemented
that other people have devised to

2470
01:11:28,171 --> 01:11:31,530
help people with injuries that
are trying to still train hard.

2471
01:11:31,531 --> 01:11:34,530
Like that gravity treadmill
thing that's in our,

2472
01:11:34,590 --> 01:11:36,540
in our altitude chamber.

2473
01:11:36,540 --> 01:11:38,900
So you strap that around
you and you're getting not,

2474
01:11:38,901 --> 01:11:39,090
you know,

2475
01:11:39,090 --> 01:11:40,830
I don't know what the ratio is too.

2476
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:41,760
You know,

2477
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:44,580
if you're true weight to what type of
stress you're putting on your body,

2478
01:11:44,581 --> 01:11:47,310
but it's much less and going out and
run it on a regular treadmill or on the

2479
01:11:47,311 --> 01:11:49,830
street now outside the
underwater treadmill,

2480
01:11:49,860 --> 01:11:50,460
which you saw.

2481
01:11:50,460 --> 01:11:51,510
So that was weird.

2482
01:11:51,511 --> 01:11:53,610
Angela Hill was on that and I was like,

2483
01:11:53,611 --> 01:11:54,240
what's that like?

2484
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:54,541
She's like,

2485
01:11:54,541 --> 01:11:55,190
it's weird.

2486
01:11:55,190 --> 01:11:55,680
Yeah,

2487
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:56,370
it's like,

2488
01:11:56,370 --> 01:11:57,270
it's like,

2489
01:11:57,300 --> 01:11:59,100
it just seems like the floor is moving.

2490
01:11:59,101 --> 01:11:59,620
You've got to check,

2491
01:11:59,620 --> 01:12:00,453
keep up with it.

2492
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:02,670
Basically it's a rising floor.

2493
01:12:02,671 --> 01:12:03,870
So you rise up to the top,

2494
01:12:03,871 --> 01:12:04,531
you step on it,

2495
01:12:04,531 --> 01:12:07,860
and then it drops down and it works
like a regular treadmill because you're,

2496
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:09,470
but because you're under water,

2497
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:13,140
you're putting less stress on
obviously your lower extremities.

2498
01:12:13,580 --> 01:12:17,700
And if you notice also there's cameras
underwater with a TV screen right in

2499
01:12:17,701 --> 01:12:18,380
front of,

2500
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:18,901
of the,

2501
01:12:18,901 --> 01:12:19,320
uh,

2502
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:20,270
the person using them.

2503
01:12:20,290 --> 01:12:24,000
The idea there is if you have an
ankle injury or a knee injury,

2504
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:27,420
you could take a look at how your foot's
coming down and are you favor in it and

2505
01:12:27,421 --> 01:12:27,930
what's your,

2506
01:12:27,930 --> 01:12:28,890
your gate looking like?

2507
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:31,040
So cool piece of equipment.

2508
01:12:31,050 --> 01:12:33,660
Connor was using that quite
a bit and in the run up to,

2509
01:12:33,661 --> 01:12:33,860
uh,

2510
01:12:33,860 --> 01:12:34,351
to Floyd,

2511
01:12:34,351 --> 01:12:36,450
he put a lot of stuff out there
on social media on that thing.

2512
01:12:36,451 --> 01:12:37,140
I think you liked it.

2513
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:37,441
Yeah.

2514
01:12:37,441 --> 01:12:38,490
Well he's got a bum knee,

2515
01:12:38,491 --> 01:12:38,850
right?

2516
01:12:38,850 --> 01:12:40,260
He's got a niece that has had a,

2517
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:41,880
he's had some issues with in the past.

2518
01:12:42,330 --> 01:12:43,163
There it is.

2519
01:12:43,540 --> 01:12:44,373
That's done.

2520
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:46,610
There's a Dunkin French
off there to the right,

2521
01:12:46,650 --> 01:12:46,951
I think.

2522
01:12:46,951 --> 01:12:49,500
Just drops you down and
then you run in that thing.

2523
01:12:49,530 --> 01:12:50,363
Yup.

2524
01:12:51,380 --> 01:12:51,880
Yeah.

2525
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:52,621
Oh Man,

2526
01:12:52,621 --> 01:12:54,650
I'm not 100% sold on that
to be honest with it.

2527
01:12:54,651 --> 01:12:55,800
That's why I should come out and get it.

2528
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:56,191
Get on it.

2529
01:12:56,191 --> 01:12:56,450
Yeah.

2530
01:12:56,450 --> 01:12:57,630
I mean I'm sure it's difficult,

2531
01:12:57,631 --> 01:13:02,631
but I think that like actually carrying
your weight and running on hills is a

2532
01:13:03,391 --> 01:13:04,950
way to go probably now look,

2533
01:13:04,951 --> 01:13:06,840
if you're coming off an ACL surgery,

2534
01:13:06,980 --> 01:13:07,290
right,

2535
01:13:07,290 --> 01:13:10,650
and you know you're taking baby
steps to get back to running,

2536
01:13:11,070 --> 01:13:11,761
it's probably there.

2537
01:13:11,761 --> 01:13:12,430
Otherwise,

2538
01:13:12,430 --> 01:13:14,430
if you're healthy and you know,

2539
01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:16,560
training for a fight coming
up in a couple of weeks,

2540
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:18,300
I don't know if that's necessarily,

2541
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:19,680
that's he's good equipment for you.

2542
01:13:19,770 --> 01:13:21,420
He's a guy that I'm puzzled by.

2543
01:13:21,421 --> 01:13:21,900
Conor.

2544
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:23,280
Obviously I'm a gigantic fan,

2545
01:13:23,281 --> 01:13:24,061
but man,

2546
01:13:24,061 --> 01:13:24,930
his cardio,

2547
01:13:25,140 --> 01:13:27,120
it seems like there's a thing there.

2548
01:13:27,150 --> 01:13:28,110
There's something there.

2549
01:13:28,111 --> 01:13:29,790
Whether it's the style that he fights,

2550
01:13:29,791 --> 01:13:32,220
the explosive sprinting
style that he fights,

2551
01:13:32,221 --> 01:13:33,300
it's unsustainable,

2552
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:34,021
you know,

2553
01:13:34,021 --> 01:13:38,340
or whether or not there seems to be some
sort of an issue that that needs to be

2554
01:13:38,341 --> 01:13:39,174
addressed.

2555
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:42,780
Some much more radical approach
to a strength and conditioning.

2556
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:46,500
And I would love to see the guys that
performance institute try to tackle that

2557
01:13:46,501 --> 01:13:47,400
and try to figure out,

2558
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:47,821
I mean,

2559
01:13:47,821 --> 01:13:49,790
I'm sure they've run vo
two Max is on them and,

2560
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:51,180
but he gets it.

2561
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:52,620
He did most of his camp there,

2562
01:13:52,621 --> 01:13:53,161
but you know,

2563
01:13:53,161 --> 01:13:56,160
he had his own team around him
that was kind of directing him.

2564
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:57,000
Um,

2565
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:57,870
but in his defense,

2566
01:13:57,871 --> 01:13:59,190
this was a very quick camp.

2567
01:13:59,590 --> 01:14:02,220
You're getting ready for a 12 round fight
with the greatest fighter of all time

2568
01:14:02,221 --> 01:14:03,054
in boxing.

2569
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:03,930
Jesus Christ.

2570
01:14:03,930 --> 01:14:05,100
It's like six or seven weeks.

2571
01:14:05,101 --> 01:14:06,690
I think Floyd knew what he was doing.

2572
01:14:07,030 --> 01:14:09,810
I tell you one of the incredible things
about that and there wasn't a lot said

2573
01:14:09,811 --> 01:14:12,490
about it going back to kind
my world anti-doping world.

2574
01:14:12,491 --> 01:14:14,770
So Floyd does this for all his fights.

2575
01:14:14,771 --> 01:14:18,100
He basically hires you
sought to do testing.

2576
01:14:18,730 --> 01:14:19,390
Um,

2577
01:14:19,390 --> 01:14:20,010
it's not,

2578
01:14:20,010 --> 01:14:20,780
you know,

2579
01:14:20,780 --> 01:14:24,480
it's not the same as the UFC program
where you're subject to testing year round

2580
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:25,540
in boxing.

2581
01:14:25,570 --> 01:14:29,170
Once the fight has made you saw to
then comes in and does collecting.

2582
01:14:29,171 --> 01:14:31,900
So it depends on how far
out the fight was made.

2583
01:14:31,901 --> 01:14:34,540
But Conor and Floyd sign that contract,

2584
01:14:34,541 --> 01:14:35,830
was it seven weeks out?

2585
01:14:35,831 --> 01:14:40,540
Maybe they were each tested
16 times and that seven weeks.

2586
01:14:40,541 --> 01:14:45,280
And I guarantee you they are the two
most tested athletes and that pure short

2587
01:14:45,281 --> 01:14:48,070
period of time ever in the
history of anti-doping.

2588
01:14:48,071 --> 01:14:51,040
So not only was it a
incredibly cool event,

2589
01:14:51,041 --> 01:14:52,660
but I think incredibly clean,

2590
01:14:52,661 --> 01:14:57,160
cool and clean for the fans and know that
you know how out of the way those two

2591
01:14:57,161 --> 01:15:00,160
guys went to ensure that that
fight was fair and clean.

2592
01:15:00,460 --> 01:15:02,020
That is amazing enough credit for that.

2593
01:15:02,740 --> 01:15:03,191
It's too bad.

2594
01:15:03,191 --> 01:15:06,160
There's not too performance institutes
or you could have one right next to each

2595
01:15:06,161 --> 01:15:06,341
other.

2596
01:15:06,341 --> 01:15:08,170
We're opponents could train at very,

2597
01:15:08,171 --> 01:15:08,321
you know,

2598
01:15:08,321 --> 01:15:12,400
like you could film things at
the performance institute in a,

2599
01:15:12,401 --> 01:15:13,240
at a level.

2600
01:15:13,660 --> 01:15:14,170
Um,

2601
01:15:14,170 --> 01:15:19,170
Forrest Griffin was showing me how the
octagon is set up with 360 degree cameras

2602
01:15:19,570 --> 01:15:24,570
and you could literally film
and then rotate angles up down.

2603
01:15:25,180 --> 01:15:25,750
You can,

2604
01:15:25,750 --> 01:15:28,030
you can move around and show,

2605
01:15:28,390 --> 01:15:28,661
oh,

2606
01:15:28,661 --> 01:15:29,890
when you're throwing this punch,

2607
01:15:29,891 --> 01:15:31,330
your back foot is coming off the ground.

2608
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:32,980
When you're leaning to your left,

2609
01:15:32,981 --> 01:15:34,150
you're dropping your hand.

2610
01:15:34,810 --> 01:15:39,010
It's like the John Madden telestrator
do stop action and draw on that huge big

2611
01:15:39,011 --> 01:15:42,400
screen next to the octagon around
exactly what Floyd was shown.

2612
01:15:42,430 --> 01:15:42,971
Or excuse me,

2613
01:15:42,971 --> 01:15:43,301
when,

2614
01:15:43,301 --> 01:15:43,750
um,

2615
01:15:43,750 --> 01:15:44,470
uh,

2616
01:15:44,470 --> 01:15:46,320
forest was showing me how
you can move it around.

2617
01:15:46,330 --> 01:15:46,631
I was like,

2618
01:15:46,631 --> 01:15:47,650
this is insane.

2619
01:15:47,651 --> 01:15:48,011
Like this.

2620
01:15:48,011 --> 01:15:50,740
What a tool this is for
technique development.

2621
01:15:50,770 --> 01:15:51,101
It really,

2622
01:15:51,101 --> 01:15:52,580
and I think we're at the infancy of,

2623
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:56,390
of these coaches coming in and figuring
out how they can use these things he had

2624
01:15:56,391 --> 01:15:58,120
sent that they can benefit their funders.

2625
01:15:58,490 --> 01:15:59,060
I mean that,

2626
01:15:59,060 --> 01:16:00,100
there it is right there.

2627
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:00,670
Yeah.

2628
01:16:00,670 --> 01:16:01,420
This thing,

2629
01:16:01,420 --> 01:16:01,720
oh,

2630
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:02,440
there's my tour.

2631
01:16:02,440 --> 01:16:02,601
Well,

2632
01:16:02,601 --> 01:16:05,910
did somebody put that up on
these fucking on already?

2633
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:06,753
They put it up.

2634
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:07,870
Um,

2635
01:16:07,870 --> 01:16:08,703
I didn't put this,

2636
01:16:08,710 --> 01:16:09,020
Oh yeah.

2637
01:16:09,020 --> 01:16:10,090
Put It on my Instagram stories,

2638
01:16:10,450 --> 01:16:11,800
but I didn't put it on Youtube.

2639
01:16:11,860 --> 01:16:12,970
Somebody put it on youtube here.

2640
01:16:13,090 --> 01:16:18,090
So what what force was showing me was how
they can pause it and slow mo and back

2641
01:16:18,761 --> 01:16:23,761
it up and then change angles and that
all the fighters sparring sessions or

2642
01:16:23,771 --> 01:16:25,450
filmed their film from an overhead,

2643
01:16:25,451 --> 01:16:26,800
their film from the sides.

2644
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:30,130
And there's cameras
all around the octagon.

2645
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:33,070
I mean it's just what a facility man.

2646
01:16:33,370 --> 01:16:33,581
Yeah.

2647
01:16:33,581 --> 01:16:35,590
I mean I really think
we talked about this.

2648
01:16:35,591 --> 01:16:37,750
This is bringing the sport
to a whole new level.

2649
01:16:37,820 --> 01:16:38,653
Yeah.

2650
01:16:39,610 --> 01:16:43,810
Well Frances is going to be your
first test tube sorta child.

2651
01:16:44,460 --> 01:16:45,140
Yeah.

2652
01:16:45,140 --> 01:16:46,750
You know you talked about,

2653
01:16:46,751 --> 01:16:49,650
wouldn't it be nice to have two
opponents working side by side?

2654
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:51,250
The Pi has that capability.

2655
01:16:51,251 --> 01:16:52,210
I mean as you saw it,

2656
01:16:52,270 --> 01:16:53,650
it's set up specifically.

2657
01:16:53,651 --> 01:16:57,310
So you have certain things downstairs
and certain things upstairs so you'd have

2658
01:16:57,311 --> 01:16:57,861
to schedule it.

2659
01:16:57,861 --> 01:16:58,990
So Steve Bay says,

2660
01:16:58,991 --> 01:16:59,321
Hey man,

2661
01:16:59,321 --> 01:17:00,280
I want to come out and use this.

2662
01:17:00,281 --> 01:17:00,580
It is,

2663
01:17:00,580 --> 01:17:01,720
it is open to Steve Bay.

2664
01:17:01,721 --> 01:17:02,690
We could schedule it.

2665
01:17:02,691 --> 01:17:05,740
So Steve Bay's downstairs doing a strength
and conditioning and while Francis

2666
01:17:05,741 --> 01:17:06,580
was upstairs,

2667
01:17:06,990 --> 01:17:09,010
it's a lot of what forest does force,

2668
01:17:09,020 --> 01:17:09,320
you know,

2669
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:12,800
it could be the intermediary to
make sure Francis goes out one door,

2670
01:17:12,801 --> 01:17:15,080
Steepbank comes in another
never run into themselves.

2671
01:17:15,081 --> 01:17:17,030
But that definitely has taken
them and they are there.

2672
01:17:17,031 --> 01:17:17,600
But yeah,

2673
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:18,310
but what I would,

2674
01:17:18,310 --> 01:17:19,010
if I was tpa,

2675
01:17:19,010 --> 01:17:21,770
I would not want to be doing strength
conditioning and then in between sets,

2676
01:17:21,860 --> 01:17:23,970
just like have your ear
and you hear Coppola.

2677
01:17:27,540 --> 01:17:31,010
Francis is hitting the heavy
bag and scaring everybody.

2678
01:17:31,430 --> 01:17:32,263
You your style.

2679
01:17:32,890 --> 01:17:33,610
You tried that,

2680
01:17:33,610 --> 01:17:34,640
that punch machine.

2681
01:17:34,670 --> 01:17:35,061
Yeah,

2682
01:17:35,061 --> 01:17:37,430
he's got the world record punch on that.

2683
01:17:37,670 --> 01:17:38,150
There's a,

2684
01:17:38,150 --> 01:17:39,830
what it is is like a for folks,

2685
01:17:39,831 --> 01:17:40,551
it's a pad.

2686
01:17:40,551 --> 01:17:41,181
It's adjustable,

2687
01:17:41,181 --> 01:17:43,640
it moves up and down and you punch it.

2688
01:17:43,641 --> 01:17:45,950
And not only did he
break the world record,

2689
01:17:45,951 --> 01:17:49,790
he broke it by several thousand
pounds per square inch.

2690
01:17:50,870 --> 01:17:51,230
Yeah.

2691
01:17:51,230 --> 01:17:52,100
I think his reading,

2692
01:17:52,101 --> 01:17:53,510
and I don't know what the reading is,

2693
01:17:53,511 --> 01:17:57,500
was 129,000 something and yeah,

2694
01:17:57,501 --> 01:17:58,190
he's terrified.

2695
01:17:58,190 --> 01:17:59,023
It is.

2696
01:17:59,210 --> 01:18:00,260
You hit it a couple times,

2697
01:18:00,261 --> 01:18:00,411
man.

2698
01:18:00,411 --> 01:18:01,520
I thought you were hitting pretty hard.

2699
01:18:01,521 --> 01:18:01,641
Now,

2700
01:18:01,641 --> 01:18:02,301
what did you register?

2701
01:18:02,301 --> 01:18:03,920
Like a 35 or 40,000?

2702
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:06,270
I got 46 is my hardest one to,

2703
01:18:06,271 --> 01:18:07,104
I hurt my hand.

2704
01:18:08,900 --> 01:18:10,670
He kind of put gloves on to do that too.

2705
01:18:10,970 --> 01:18:14,870
I would imagine that being wrapped up
and that's an argument that I've had many

2706
01:18:14,871 --> 01:18:17,060
times when it comes to MMA in general.

2707
01:18:17,061 --> 01:18:19,970
I like how you can angle it so
you can throw an uppercut as well.

2708
01:18:20,380 --> 01:18:20,810
Um,

2709
01:18:20,810 --> 01:18:22,250
that's an argument that I've had.

2710
01:18:22,270 --> 01:18:22,910
Um,

2711
01:18:22,910 --> 01:18:24,320
for MMA in general,

2712
01:18:24,350 --> 01:18:26,540
I think it's weird that we,

2713
01:18:26,580 --> 01:18:27,260
uh,

2714
01:18:27,260 --> 01:18:32,260
are allowed to elbow with no pad knee
with no pad kick with no pad on the Shin,

2715
01:18:33,830 --> 01:18:35,420
but the knuckles are protected.

2716
01:18:35,810 --> 01:18:40,810
And I think that it really probably
allows people to deliver more damage with

2717
01:18:42,081 --> 01:18:42,950
the knuckles padded.

2718
01:18:42,951 --> 01:18:47,030
I don't think padded knuckles helps
your opponent as much as it helps you.

2719
01:18:47,240 --> 01:18:49,070
And especially risk protection.

2720
01:18:49,071 --> 01:18:52,610
Like when I was trying to punch
that thing with just my bare hands,

2721
01:18:52,910 --> 01:18:53,743
um,

2722
01:18:54,110 --> 01:18:54,943
which is stupid,

2723
01:18:55,070 --> 01:18:56,330
especially when you haven't warmed up.

2724
01:18:56,331 --> 01:18:56,750
Right.

2725
01:18:56,750 --> 01:18:57,640
But you're,

2726
01:18:57,680 --> 01:18:58,580
you realize like your,

2727
01:18:58,760 --> 01:18:59,810
your wrist moves around,

2728
01:18:59,811 --> 01:19:02,270
he's slamming of that thing
and if you're hitting it hard,

2729
01:19:02,271 --> 01:19:03,140
your wrist moves around.

2730
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:03,981
Well that's the case.

2731
01:19:03,981 --> 01:19:05,480
When you're punching a person to like,

2732
01:19:05,481 --> 01:19:09,680
you have to be much more precise with
where you're targeting and what you're

2733
01:19:09,681 --> 01:19:10,430
hitting.

2734
01:19:10,430 --> 01:19:12,680
You can't hit foreheads and elbows,

2735
01:19:12,681 --> 01:19:14,210
you'll break your hand like very easily.

2736
01:19:14,540 --> 01:19:15,410
And I wonder,

2737
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:16,160
it's just,

2738
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:18,400
it seems barbaric to people to,

2739
01:19:18,470 --> 01:19:19,820
to fight bare knuckle,

2740
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,070
which to me is kind of
crazy cause you're kicking,

2741
01:19:22,370 --> 01:19:22,761
like you're,

2742
01:19:22,761 --> 01:19:26,150
you're shinning people in the
head like I don't understand.

2743
01:19:26,180 --> 01:19:30,620
Like we have this weird sort of childish
view of like what should and shouldn't

2744
01:19:30,621 --> 01:19:30,771
be.

2745
01:19:30,771 --> 01:19:33,680
Legal elbows are some of the hardest.

2746
01:19:33,860 --> 01:19:34,071
I mean,

2747
01:19:34,071 --> 01:19:36,890
you can just do that with an
owl and it doesn't hurt at all.

2748
01:19:37,130 --> 01:19:37,551
You know,

2749
01:19:37,551 --> 01:19:38,450
your knees,

2750
01:19:38,451 --> 01:19:39,410
your shins,

2751
01:19:39,590 --> 01:19:40,400
those guys that,

2752
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:41,150
uh,

2753
01:19:41,150 --> 01:19:43,160
spar Muay Thai for a years and years,

2754
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:47,840
their shins develop calcification all
over the top where they can kick baseball

2755
01:19:47,841 --> 01:19:48,171
bats.

2756
01:19:48,171 --> 01:19:49,070
Like there's trees.

2757
01:19:49,310 --> 01:19:49,920
Yeah,

2758
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:50,150
it's,

2759
01:19:50,150 --> 01:19:51,050
there's a great one.

2760
01:19:51,051 --> 01:19:52,160
Have a bull cow,

2761
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:52,670
uh,

2762
01:19:52,670 --> 01:19:55,310
kicking a banana tree just going cray.

2763
01:19:55,311 --> 01:19:57,440
And he's one of the greatest
tie fighters of all time,

2764
01:19:57,441 --> 01:19:58,010
but he's,

2765
01:19:58,010 --> 01:20:00,890
he's chopping at this banana tree
and cuts it in half and you're like,

2766
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:01,753
Jesus,

2767
01:20:01,940 --> 01:20:05,270
like how is it okay that that guy can
kick someone in the face with that?

2768
01:20:05,510 --> 01:20:07,290
But you have to have pads here.

2769
01:20:07,291 --> 01:20:08,124
He was right here.

2770
01:20:08,590 --> 01:20:08,790
Like,

2771
01:20:08,790 --> 01:20:09,900
give me some volume on this.

2772
01:20:11,330 --> 01:20:12,163
Okay.

2773
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:20,490
Waken a fucking tree.

2774
01:20:20,660 --> 01:20:21,493
I

2775
01:20:23,250 --> 01:20:25,570
is not doing that with his bare
knuckle will tell you that.

2776
01:20:26,380 --> 01:20:27,213
That's insane.

2777
01:20:32,490 --> 01:20:33,930
Fucking hit in the face with that.

2778
01:20:34,110 --> 01:20:36,960
But see the difference
like that's hard bone.

2779
01:20:37,050 --> 01:20:37,770
Yeah,

2780
01:20:37,770 --> 01:20:38,700
no padding.

2781
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:41,640
Why do you have to have padding on your
knuckles but you don't have to have it

2782
01:20:41,641 --> 01:20:45,180
on your shins and your
knees and your elbows.

2783
01:20:45,181 --> 01:20:49,350
That seems to me to be a silly
way of approaching everything.

2784
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:50,553
Yeah.

2785
01:20:51,060 --> 01:20:52,500
I mean maybe we could pat up everything,

2786
01:20:52,501 --> 01:20:53,430
but then people get mad.

2787
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:53,880
Yeah.

2788
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:55,260
Like we're posing for the sport.

2789
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:56,760
I think you go the other way.

2790
01:20:56,761 --> 01:20:58,230
I think you don't pat up anything.

2791
01:20:58,710 --> 01:21:00,350
I think you pat up your
Dick and that's it.

2792
01:21:00,930 --> 01:21:01,621
That's what I think.

2793
01:21:01,621 --> 01:21:03,060
Pat Up your teeth pad up your Dick.

2794
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:04,313
Let her rip.

2795
01:21:04,350 --> 01:21:06,000
I really think they
should fight bare knuckle.

2796
01:21:06,150 --> 01:21:08,250
I just don't think it
makes any sense whatsoever.

2797
01:21:08,460 --> 01:21:10,720
Especially considering
the fact that I poke.

2798
01:21:10,721 --> 01:21:12,060
So one of the major considerations,

2799
01:21:12,061 --> 01:21:12,480
right.

2800
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:14,250
You're not going to mitigate
that with those gloves.

2801
01:21:14,280 --> 01:21:15,040
You're just,

2802
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:15,331
you know,

2803
01:21:15,331 --> 01:21:19,380
unless they develop some sort of a new
designed where the gloves are much more

2804
01:21:19,381 --> 01:21:20,280
curled in.

2805
01:21:20,340 --> 01:21:20,810
Yeah.

2806
01:21:20,810 --> 01:21:21,420
Um,

2807
01:21:21,420 --> 01:21:21,721
there,

2808
01:21:21,721 --> 01:21:22,250
there's the,

2809
01:21:22,250 --> 01:21:23,850
the I pokes or it was
going to be an issue.

2810
01:21:23,851 --> 01:21:26,970
It would be the exact same
issue if you had bare knuckle.

2811
01:21:27,090 --> 01:21:27,241
Well,

2812
01:21:27,241 --> 01:21:27,510
yeah,

2813
01:21:27,510 --> 01:21:29,730
I mean now you can take away
with a new unified rules,

2814
01:21:29,731 --> 01:21:30,300
which,

2815
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:30,690
uh,

2816
01:21:30,690 --> 01:21:32,490
ironically enough aren't unified.

2817
01:21:32,750 --> 01:21:32,960
Yeah.

2818
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:36,800
I'm so we go from commission
to commission and you know,

2819
01:21:36,820 --> 01:21:39,090
flight or what have to inform them.

2820
01:21:39,091 --> 01:21:39,541
Fight week,

2821
01:21:39,541 --> 01:21:39,661
Hey,

2822
01:21:39,661 --> 01:21:44,280
what are the rules here that's so unfair
to these fighters that in our training

2823
01:21:44,281 --> 01:21:46,680
and developing that instinct
to some of these rules.

2824
01:21:47,370 --> 01:21:47,851
But anyway,

2825
01:21:47,851 --> 01:21:49,890
the new unified rules
which aren't unified,

2826
01:21:49,950 --> 01:21:50,640
um,

2827
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:54,030
anybody who's extending the fingers
at the referee has to warn them first.

2828
01:21:54,031 --> 01:21:55,230
But they continue to do that.

2829
01:21:55,231 --> 01:21:56,280
A point can be taken away.

2830
01:21:56,430 --> 01:21:57,750
I think they should take a point.

2831
01:21:57,780 --> 01:22:00,210
Every time I got gets
poked in the eye and my,

2832
01:22:00,230 --> 01:22:02,910
my thought process is even
if it's unintentional,

2833
01:22:02,911 --> 01:22:04,080
the damage has been done.

2834
01:22:04,260 --> 01:22:04,540
And if,

2835
01:22:04,540 --> 01:22:05,373
uh,

2836
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:06,570
if you could see it on the replay,

2837
01:22:06,571 --> 01:22:07,260
legitimate,

2838
01:22:07,260 --> 01:22:09,210
I poke and you see the guy and wincing,

2839
01:22:09,211 --> 01:22:09,390
like,

2840
01:22:09,390 --> 01:22:10,201
which we've seen many,

2841
01:22:10,201 --> 01:22:14,850
many times that guys compromised and I
think that it's only fair that a point be

2842
01:22:14,851 --> 01:22:16,560
taken away even if it was unintentional.

2843
01:22:16,740 --> 01:22:17,191
What's like,

2844
01:22:17,191 --> 01:22:17,431
you know,

2845
01:22:17,431 --> 01:22:19,320
kicking or needing a down fighter too,

2846
01:22:19,350 --> 01:22:19,741
that you know,

2847
01:22:19,741 --> 01:22:22,230
you have to show intent
to take a point away.

2848
01:22:22,280 --> 01:22:23,070
Right.

2849
01:22:23,070 --> 01:22:26,550
How is the referee going to get in the
head of a fighter to say whether or not

2850
01:22:26,551 --> 01:22:27,430
that was intentional?

2851
01:22:27,431 --> 01:22:27,840
Ride it,

2852
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:30,390
it should almost be I
think that if it's done,

2853
01:22:30,420 --> 01:22:30,511
uh,

2854
01:22:30,511 --> 01:22:31,410
points taken away,

2855
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:31,861
I agree.

2856
01:22:31,861 --> 01:22:35,010
Remove the intent from it because the
damage is already done at that point.

2857
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:35,220
Yeah.

2858
01:22:35,220 --> 01:22:37,320
It doesn't matter whether
or not this intentional,

2859
01:22:37,350 --> 01:22:37,561
I mean,

2860
01:22:37,561 --> 01:22:39,120
we're not putting the
blame on the fighter.

2861
01:22:39,150 --> 01:22:39,511
It just,

2862
01:22:39,511 --> 01:22:40,141
it happened.

2863
01:22:40,141 --> 01:22:41,430
It's one of the unfortunate things,

2864
01:22:41,431 --> 01:22:45,170
but the fighter that got hit is the
one who suffers the consequences of it.

2865
01:22:45,540 --> 01:22:47,880
There's no way it should
be an even exchange like,

2866
01:22:47,910 --> 01:22:48,031
oh,

2867
01:22:48,031 --> 01:22:48,511
I'm sorry,

2868
01:22:48,511 --> 01:22:50,590
I accidentally need your eye socket it.

2869
01:22:50,591 --> 01:22:51,230
Yeah,

2870
01:22:51,230 --> 01:22:51,380
yeah,

2871
01:22:51,380 --> 01:22:51,541
no,

2872
01:22:51,541 --> 01:22:52,530
no point taken.

2873
01:22:52,531 --> 01:22:53,930
And now you can't go on that.

2874
01:22:53,931 --> 01:22:54,900
That to me sounds,

2875
01:22:55,470 --> 01:22:57,690
I think there's room to,

2876
01:22:57,691 --> 01:22:57,960
to,

2877
01:22:57,960 --> 01:22:59,990
to alter the rules and I mean I,

2878
01:22:59,991 --> 01:23:00,600
I've,

2879
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:03,720
I'm beating a dead horse with my bare
knuckle thing because I've been talking

2880
01:23:03,721 --> 01:23:05,750
about that for years because
I just think people have a

2881
01:23:06,290 --> 01:23:10,660
greatly exaggerated perception of the
effectiveness of punching people in the

2882
01:23:10,661 --> 01:23:11,290
face.

2883
01:23:11,290 --> 01:23:14,140
And I think that greatly exaggerated
perception is due to the fact that they

2884
01:23:14,141 --> 01:23:15,010
wrap their hands,

2885
01:23:15,340 --> 01:23:17,560
you wrap up your wrists and your,

2886
01:23:17,561 --> 01:23:21,140
your wrist and your hand becomes a
cast where it's not bending at all.

2887
01:23:21,150 --> 01:23:25,210
I mean you get deep in there with
athletic tape and Gauze and they cover the

2888
01:23:25,211 --> 01:23:28,120
knuckles and everything gets good at
it and you could just fucking blast

2889
01:23:28,121 --> 01:23:28,954
something with that.

2890
01:23:29,290 --> 01:23:31,360
But when you just have just your hands,

2891
01:23:31,361 --> 01:23:32,710
it feels very delicate.

2892
01:23:32,711 --> 01:23:37,270
I always tell people you should punch
the bag occasionally at least bare

2893
01:23:37,271 --> 01:23:37,870
knuckle,

2894
01:23:37,870 --> 01:23:42,220
just go and punch the bag and you realize
you can't really hit nearly as hard.

2895
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:43,593
It's just,

2896
01:23:44,230 --> 01:23:48,880
I just think that we have like you
can't take the shit out of your ankles.

2897
01:23:49,150 --> 01:23:49,600
Right?

2898
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:49,930
Right.

2899
01:23:49,930 --> 01:23:54,100
I mean we've stopped fighters from
walking into the octagon with fully tie,

2900
01:23:54,101 --> 01:23:55,090
taped up ankles,

2901
01:23:55,091 --> 01:23:55,560
you know,

2902
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:56,440
pull some commissions,

2903
01:23:56,441 --> 01:23:59,200
allow light tape and then
a neoprene sleeve over it.

2904
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:00,430
Others say no,

2905
01:24:00,510 --> 01:24:01,120
nothing.

2906
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:01,541
Again,

2907
01:24:01,541 --> 01:24:03,040
the uniformity is again,

2908
01:24:03,540 --> 01:24:04,700
you know what to talk about uniform,

2909
01:24:04,701 --> 01:24:06,850
but he kind of bringing it
back to the anti-doping world.

2910
01:24:06,851 --> 01:24:11,280
This is a big point of contention
I have with athletic commissions.

2911
01:24:11,290 --> 01:24:11,681
Really,

2912
01:24:11,681 --> 01:24:12,520
really frustrated.

2913
01:24:12,521 --> 01:24:13,840
And that's the marijuana rules.

2914
01:24:14,590 --> 01:24:16,300
So you're talking my language is,

2915
01:24:16,301 --> 01:24:17,051
you have to see,

2916
01:24:17,051 --> 01:24:17,471
I thought.

2917
01:24:17,471 --> 01:24:22,471
So the UFC follows the water rules
world antidoping agency kind of sets the

2918
01:24:23,291 --> 01:24:24,011
world standard.

2919
01:24:24,011 --> 01:24:28,360
They have scientists that study these
drugs and determine a is something

2920
01:24:28,361 --> 01:24:30,550
performance enhancing B,

2921
01:24:30,610 --> 01:24:32,110
is it a health and safety issue?

2922
01:24:32,620 --> 01:24:35,320
And over the last couple
of years they rise.

2923
01:24:35,350 --> 01:24:38,860
They raised the marijuana threshold
used to be 15 nanograms per milliliter.

2924
01:24:38,861 --> 01:24:42,100
Now must succeed 150
nanograms per milliliter,

2925
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:45,100
which everybody metabolizes differently.

2926
01:24:45,190 --> 01:24:47,830
But you know from scientists
that I've talked about,

2927
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:50,470
the ingestion of marijuana or THC,

2928
01:24:50,790 --> 01:24:54,970
the psychoactive ingredient has to be
pretty damn close to that collection in

2929
01:24:54,971 --> 01:24:57,580
order to exceed 150
nanograms per milliliter,

2930
01:24:57,640 --> 01:25:00,910
which means you literally almost
have to be high the day pretty much.

2931
01:25:01,510 --> 01:25:04,190
So if an athlete just
takes a day or two off,

2932
01:25:04,350 --> 01:25:07,690
their most light suggests
longer than that,

2933
01:25:07,691 --> 01:25:11,380
just because you never know how different
people metabolize things differently

2934
01:25:11,381 --> 01:25:12,400
as you're cutting weight,

2935
01:25:12,401 --> 01:25:14,560
whether you're releasing
some from your fat cells.

2936
01:25:14,561 --> 01:25:15,011
I don't know,

2937
01:25:15,011 --> 01:25:16,060
I would suggest you know,

2938
01:25:16,061 --> 01:25:16,841
several weeks,

2939
01:25:16,841 --> 01:25:19,840
but the reality is it could
be a lot closer than that.

2940
01:25:20,170 --> 01:25:22,600
What we're running into
several athletic commissions,

2941
01:25:22,870 --> 01:25:25,870
Texas being one New York being another,

2942
01:25:26,110 --> 01:25:30,550
we had probably the most extreme one
last month in Michigan that have lower

2943
01:25:30,820 --> 01:25:31,660
thresholds.

2944
01:25:32,140 --> 01:25:32,740
Um,

2945
01:25:32,740 --> 01:25:37,740
Texas and New York have 35 or 50
Michigan where we just came from has a no

2946
01:25:40,001 --> 01:25:43,480
tolerance policy for marijuana.

2947
01:25:43,481 --> 01:25:48,430
So any measurable amount of THC
would cause a positive test.

2948
01:25:48,431 --> 01:25:51,580
And we lobbied them hard in
anticipation of our event.

2949
01:25:51,581 --> 01:25:52,414
They're saying,

2950
01:25:52,690 --> 01:25:54,010
do you realize what this means?

2951
01:25:54,011 --> 01:25:54,251
I mean,

2952
01:25:54,251 --> 01:25:57,880
a fighter could walk through
a cloud of secondhand smoke,

2953
01:25:58,300 --> 01:25:58,511
you know,

2954
01:25:58,511 --> 01:26:02,980
on the way to weigh in or a fight and
it's going to show up a measurable amount

2955
01:26:02,990 --> 01:26:06,620
and you're going to fight or could win
a championship on that and you're going

2956
01:26:06,621 --> 01:26:08,720
to take that championship
away and overturn the,

2957
01:26:08,721 --> 01:26:09,710
when we hadn't,

2958
01:26:09,740 --> 01:26:13,820
Texas a couple wins
overturned for a threshold,

2959
01:26:13,821 --> 01:26:14,740
which I think we're a little bit of,

2960
01:26:14,750 --> 01:26:15,740
I think 35,

2961
01:26:15,770 --> 01:26:17,300
it's your 35 or 50 was there,

2962
01:26:17,330 --> 01:26:18,590
but there were slightly over that.

2963
01:26:18,590 --> 01:26:19,610
Well under the,

2964
01:26:19,630 --> 01:26:19,970
you know,

2965
01:26:19,970 --> 01:26:22,340
established world standard and man,

2966
01:26:22,341 --> 01:26:26,060
I think these athletic commissions got
to take a serious look at bringing those

2967
01:26:26,061 --> 01:26:27,260
into uniformity.

2968
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:28,633
You have,

2969
01:26:28,700 --> 01:26:29,180
you know,

2970
01:26:29,180 --> 01:26:32,750
in the u s should have certain states
now where it's legal medically and

2971
01:26:32,751 --> 01:26:33,501
recreationally,

2972
01:26:33,501 --> 01:26:33,980
but you know,

2973
01:26:33,980 --> 01:26:35,060
arguably federally,

2974
01:26:35,630 --> 01:26:35,940
um,

2975
01:26:35,940 --> 01:26:36,561
still illegal.

2976
01:26:36,561 --> 01:26:40,700
But you have some countries where it's
completely legal and you have doctors

2977
01:26:40,701 --> 01:26:42,920
prescribing this for,

2978
01:26:42,940 --> 01:26:43,340
you know,

2979
01:26:43,340 --> 01:26:47,120
pain control or stress
or anxiety and you know,

2980
01:26:47,170 --> 01:26:47,770
uh,

2981
01:26:47,770 --> 01:26:47,870
uh,

2982
01:26:47,870 --> 01:26:49,130
commission like Michigan,

2983
01:26:49,131 --> 01:26:53,270
one of those fighters from one of those
countries that is completely legally

2984
01:26:53,271 --> 01:26:55,160
doing it under the care of a doctor.

2985
01:26:55,580 --> 01:26:59,450
And in lieu of doing a synthetic drug,

2986
01:26:59,570 --> 01:27:03,560
like an opioid or a Xanax
or something like that,

2987
01:27:04,160 --> 01:27:07,040
common sense would tell you it's
much healthier and safer to do that.

2988
01:27:07,490 --> 01:27:08,210
Um,

2989
01:27:08,210 --> 01:27:08,541
you know,

2990
01:27:08,541 --> 01:27:10,340
you're setting up this barrier that,

2991
01:27:10,370 --> 01:27:10,611
you know,

2992
01:27:10,611 --> 01:27:14,900
could negatively affect a fighter's
career if they have any discernible amount

2993
01:27:14,901 --> 01:27:15,734
in their system.

2994
01:27:16,070 --> 01:27:16,641
And,

2995
01:27:16,641 --> 01:27:17,090
um,

2996
01:27:17,090 --> 01:27:17,660
you know,

2997
01:27:17,660 --> 01:27:19,550
not only from the unified rules but from,

2998
01:27:19,551 --> 01:27:22,620
from an anti-doping
marijuana's perspective to
these commissions have got to

2999
01:27:22,621 --> 01:27:25,150
come together and you know,

3000
01:27:25,300 --> 01:27:27,410
realize what the right
thing to do is and stop,

3001
01:27:27,530 --> 01:27:27,861
you know,

3002
01:27:27,861 --> 01:27:31,520
and a lot of instances stop governing
or policing just because you can.

3003
01:27:32,210 --> 01:27:32,960
Um,

3004
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:36,170
we ran into that with the whole
Cortney Casey thing and in Texas,

3005
01:27:36,171 --> 01:27:37,250
I don't know if you familiar with that.

3006
01:27:37,490 --> 01:27:37,671
Yeah.

3007
01:27:37,671 --> 01:27:38,990
Just explain what happened.

3008
01:27:39,170 --> 01:27:42,410
So Courtney fought in Texas,

3009
01:27:42,411 --> 01:27:45,170
had a great win against Jessica Aguilar.

3010
01:27:45,171 --> 01:27:48,530
I think it was probably the
defining moment of her career.

3011
01:27:48,531 --> 01:27:49,161
She looked really,

3012
01:27:49,161 --> 01:27:49,994
really good.

3013
01:27:50,450 --> 01:27:51,283
Um,

3014
01:27:51,390 --> 01:27:52,310
a couple of weeks later,

3015
01:27:52,311 --> 01:27:54,200
I was actually at our event and Stockholm,

3016
01:27:54,201 --> 01:27:54,710
Sweden,

3017
01:27:54,710 --> 01:27:54,891
I mean,

3018
01:27:54,891 --> 01:27:56,960
it was vividly on a Friday night.

3019
01:27:57,110 --> 01:27:57,943
Um,

3020
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:01,520
I got a call from her and I can't
even understand what she's saying.

3021
01:28:01,521 --> 01:28:03,320
She's just crying uncontrollably.

3022
01:28:03,321 --> 01:28:03,920
Saint Jeff,

3023
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:04,101
you know,

3024
01:28:04,101 --> 01:28:05,150
what is going on?

3025
01:28:05,150 --> 01:28:06,780
I didn't even understand what it happens.

3026
01:28:06,790 --> 01:28:08,120
It slows down what happened.

3027
01:28:08,510 --> 01:28:11,150
So there's stuff on the Internet
about me testing positive.

3028
01:28:11,151 --> 01:28:11,830
I've,

3029
01:28:11,830 --> 01:28:15,080
I've never even thought about
using a prohibited substance.

3030
01:28:15,081 --> 01:28:16,940
I'm super careful about what I use.

3031
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:18,111
So I said,

3032
01:28:18,111 --> 01:28:18,321
okay,

3033
01:28:18,321 --> 01:28:19,250
let me check into it.

3034
01:28:19,300 --> 01:28:21,800
And so I called a guy
on the Texas commission.

3035
01:28:22,360 --> 01:28:22,641
I said,

3036
01:28:22,641 --> 01:28:22,761
hey,

3037
01:28:22,761 --> 01:28:23,870
what's going on?

3038
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:24,170
You know,

3039
01:28:24,170 --> 01:28:25,430
with this Cortney Casey thing?

3040
01:28:25,431 --> 01:28:26,151
And he tells me,

3041
01:28:26,151 --> 01:28:26,660
yeah,

3042
01:28:26,660 --> 01:28:27,110
she,

3043
01:28:27,110 --> 01:28:28,160
she tested positive.

3044
01:28:28,161 --> 01:28:29,450
We just announced it and I said,

3045
01:28:29,451 --> 01:28:30,980
for what she said,

3046
01:28:30,981 --> 01:28:33,470
or her tee ratio was elevated.

3047
01:28:33,471 --> 01:28:34,790
It was over a four to one.

3048
01:28:35,390 --> 01:28:36,020
And,

3049
01:28:36,020 --> 01:28:36,381
you know,

3050
01:28:36,381 --> 01:28:39,170
knowing with that measurement means,

3051
01:28:39,390 --> 01:28:39,750
um,

3052
01:28:39,750 --> 01:28:40,340
I said,

3053
01:28:40,340 --> 01:28:40,931
explain what it means.

3054
01:28:40,931 --> 01:28:41,121
Yeah.

3055
01:28:41,121 --> 01:28:44,060
So tee tee his testosterone,

3056
01:28:44,090 --> 01:28:44,911
he is Epi,

3057
01:28:44,911 --> 01:28:49,911
testosterone and every human being male
and female have on average a one to one

3058
01:28:50,571 --> 01:28:52,250
ratio naturally occurring in them.

3059
01:28:52,940 --> 01:28:55,910
And if you take anabolic steroids,

3060
01:28:55,911 --> 01:28:58,250
it can have a tendency
to raise that ratio,

3061
01:28:58,460 --> 01:28:59,293
um,

3062
01:28:59,660 --> 01:28:59,961
um,

3063
01:28:59,961 --> 01:29:02,010
where the t becomes higher than the e.

3064
01:29:02,580 --> 01:29:02,940
Um,

3065
01:29:02,940 --> 01:29:03,541
however,

3066
01:29:03,541 --> 01:29:07,440
what anti-doping has found out and
evolved into the last few years that

3067
01:29:07,590 --> 01:29:09,780
especially mildly elevated ratios.

3068
01:29:09,810 --> 01:29:12,540
Sometime there are natural
reasons for that happening,

3069
01:29:13,050 --> 01:29:14,460
especially in females,

3070
01:29:14,670 --> 01:29:17,790
especially females on birth control,

3071
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,340
which is illegal medication.

3072
01:29:20,790 --> 01:29:22,830
And so what you do now in anti-doping,

3073
01:29:22,831 --> 01:29:24,840
when you have an elevated tee ratio,

3074
01:29:24,841 --> 01:29:26,280
you go to a backup test.

3075
01:29:26,680 --> 01:29:31,020
That backhoe test is called an isotope
ratio mass spectrometry or earns test.

3076
01:29:31,350 --> 01:29:35,820
And that reads the carbon atom in the
testosterone in a sample to determine

3077
01:29:35,821 --> 01:29:37,320
whether or not it's plant based,

3078
01:29:37,321 --> 01:29:41,640
which would mean a synthetic
or it's naturally occurring
because testosterone is

3079
01:29:41,641 --> 01:29:43,890
synthesized through wild yams.

3080
01:29:43,891 --> 01:29:44,171
Correct?

3081
01:29:44,171 --> 01:29:44,390
Right.

3082
01:29:44,390 --> 01:29:45,171
So that's how they find out.

3083
01:29:45,171 --> 01:29:45,960
Let's plant based.

3084
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:46,793
That's correct.

3085
01:29:46,860 --> 01:29:48,600
So Texas tells me,

3086
01:29:48,601 --> 01:29:49,110
hey,

3087
01:29:49,110 --> 01:29:51,570
her ratio was a little bit
higher than afforded one.

3088
01:29:51,780 --> 01:29:54,150
That means she's positive and they say,

3089
01:29:54,210 --> 01:29:54,751
they tell me,

3090
01:29:54,751 --> 01:29:56,730
we're just following your guys' rules.

3091
01:29:56,730 --> 01:29:58,680
And I tell the guy that's not our rules.

3092
01:29:59,310 --> 01:29:59,850
I go,

3093
01:29:59,850 --> 01:30:04,140
you just announced a
positive test for this girl.

3094
01:30:04,141 --> 01:30:04,620
And Hey,

3095
01:30:04,620 --> 01:30:05,040
you know,

3096
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:06,240
maybe she did do something,

3097
01:30:06,241 --> 01:30:07,074
I don't know,

3098
01:30:07,290 --> 01:30:09,690
but you're supposed to run
the backup test for this.

3099
01:30:09,870 --> 01:30:11,400
And it was basically told me,

3100
01:30:11,401 --> 01:30:12,420
well it was a Friday.

3101
01:30:12,421 --> 01:30:12,601
He goes,

3102
01:30:12,601 --> 01:30:12,751
well,

3103
01:30:12,751 --> 01:30:14,400
our office is closed Monday,

3104
01:30:14,401 --> 01:30:15,600
we'll get back to you on Tuesday.

3105
01:30:16,290 --> 01:30:19,260
And really thereafter
it was radio silence.

3106
01:30:19,261 --> 01:30:21,480
So we were working with Courtney,

3107
01:30:21,930 --> 01:30:25,350
worked with Usada closely and
you saw a stepped in and said,

3108
01:30:25,351 --> 01:30:26,220
absolutely,

3109
01:30:26,250 --> 01:30:27,120
that is wrong.

3110
01:30:27,480 --> 01:30:31,410
We're going to go back and look at her
biological profile and we'll share that

3111
01:30:31,411 --> 01:30:31,861
with Texas.

3112
01:30:31,861 --> 01:30:35,790
We'll take a look at these tee readings
over the time of the samples that she

3113
01:30:35,791 --> 01:30:36,624
submitted.

3114
01:30:36,750 --> 01:30:37,560
Sure enough,

3115
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:40,020
most of the samples were mildly elevated.

3116
01:30:40,410 --> 01:30:41,191
And sure enough,

3117
01:30:41,191 --> 01:30:42,330
you saw to do the right thing.

3118
01:30:42,330 --> 01:30:43,950
And they went and did that backup testing.

3119
01:30:43,951 --> 01:30:45,840
And every time they did
it she was negative.

3120
01:30:46,620 --> 01:30:48,690
So they reached out to Texas,

3121
01:30:48,780 --> 01:30:48,991
said,

3122
01:30:48,991 --> 01:30:49,141
hey,

3123
01:30:49,141 --> 01:30:50,640
we'll share this information with you.

3124
01:30:50,641 --> 01:30:50,920
And,

3125
01:30:50,920 --> 01:30:51,270
and,

3126
01:30:51,270 --> 01:30:52,530
and our historical records,

3127
01:30:52,531 --> 01:30:54,870
his girl does have a naturally occurring,

3128
01:30:54,900 --> 01:30:56,670
mildly elevated t ratio.

3129
01:30:57,330 --> 01:30:57,990
Uh,

3130
01:30:57,990 --> 01:31:00,690
then went through a several
week process of figuring out,

3131
01:31:00,691 --> 01:31:01,290
hey,

3132
01:31:01,290 --> 01:31:03,060
is there some of that sample remaining?

3133
01:31:03,090 --> 01:31:04,260
Because if there is Texas,

3134
01:31:04,261 --> 01:31:08,460
you have an obligation to go ahead
and do this backup testing on it.

3135
01:31:09,270 --> 01:31:11,400
Took them a number of weeks were poor.

3136
01:31:11,401 --> 01:31:14,610
Courtney was in limbo and I'm finally,

3137
01:31:14,790 --> 01:31:16,230
Dana put him on blast,

3138
01:31:16,290 --> 01:31:18,330
basically said Texas commission,

3139
01:31:18,450 --> 01:31:18,691
you know,

3140
01:31:18,691 --> 01:31:19,530
get your shit together.

3141
01:31:19,531 --> 01:31:20,610
We're not coming back there.

3142
01:31:21,270 --> 01:31:21,990
Um,

3143
01:31:21,990 --> 01:31:25,170
and we got ahold of that
remaining sample or be sampled,

3144
01:31:25,260 --> 01:31:30,260
had it tested at a lot of laboratory
and was negative on the IRM mass that

3145
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:32,910
putting someone on blast works.

3146
01:31:36,170 --> 01:31:36,630
No,

3147
01:31:36,630 --> 01:31:36,980
it's,

3148
01:31:36,980 --> 01:31:38,160
it's an ego thing.

3149
01:31:38,190 --> 01:31:40,260
Like people are bitching at you,

3150
01:31:40,261 --> 01:31:41,560
you're going to succumb to that.

3151
01:31:41,580 --> 01:31:42,180
But yeah,

3152
01:31:42,180 --> 01:31:44,460
sometimes that's what it takes to
get someone to do the right thing.

3153
01:31:44,580 --> 01:31:45,001
It does.

3154
01:31:45,001 --> 01:31:45,181
So,

3155
01:31:45,181 --> 01:31:48,990
so this poor girl is living with the
fact that she's labeled as a cheater for

3156
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:49,913
two to three months,

3157
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:51,330
talked about she's still will be.

3158
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:52,140
Yeah.

3159
01:31:52,140 --> 01:31:52,630
Well,

3160
01:31:52,630 --> 01:31:55,140
it's one of those things like once
someone says you're a steroid cheater,

3161
01:31:56,070 --> 01:31:56,451
we all,

3162
01:31:56,451 --> 01:31:57,120
the way she talked to,

3163
01:31:57,120 --> 01:31:57,710
I mean she lived,

3164
01:31:57,710 --> 01:31:58,501
she lives on Maui,

3165
01:31:58,501 --> 01:31:59,500
so small community.

3166
01:31:59,501 --> 01:32:03,640
She talked about going to the store and
people pointing at her talking bad about

3167
01:32:03,641 --> 01:32:04,360
her.

3168
01:32:04,360 --> 01:32:05,490
She talked about she,

3169
01:32:05,491 --> 01:32:06,490
she's a coach and a gym.

3170
01:32:06,500 --> 01:32:07,061
They're coaches,

3171
01:32:07,061 --> 01:32:08,170
kids about parents,

3172
01:32:08,171 --> 01:32:08,351
you know,

3173
01:32:08,351 --> 01:32:11,350
not one her to coach their kids
when this was inland labor,

3174
01:32:11,351 --> 01:32:15,160
how many of those people heard that she
was exonerated headlines on page one for

3175
01:32:15,161 --> 01:32:16,990
tat retraction on the back page.

3176
01:32:16,990 --> 01:32:17,171
Right.

3177
01:32:17,171 --> 01:32:18,580
And nobody pays attention to that shit.

3178
01:32:19,510 --> 01:32:22,510
And you know her performance
and she fought Detroit,

3179
01:32:22,511 --> 01:32:23,080
right?

3180
01:32:23,080 --> 01:32:23,560
Yes.

3181
01:32:23,560 --> 01:32:25,330
It was not a great performance for her.

3182
01:32:25,331 --> 01:32:28,630
And I can't help but wonder
if that had affected her,

3183
01:32:28,720 --> 01:32:29,021
you know,

3184
01:32:29,021 --> 01:32:30,280
over those last couple of months.

3185
01:32:30,370 --> 01:32:32,200
I think that was just stylistic.

3186
01:32:32,610 --> 01:32:32,771
You know,

3187
01:32:32,771 --> 01:32:36,700
I just think the way she matched
up with a Felice heric was just,

3188
01:32:36,701 --> 01:32:39,190
those two bulldogs are just
clashing heads with each other.

3189
01:32:39,191 --> 01:32:40,300
They just couldn't get anything done.

3190
01:32:40,630 --> 01:32:41,051
Could be.

3191
01:32:41,051 --> 01:32:41,440
I mean that,

3192
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:43,450
but that's again going
back to the mental game,

3193
01:32:43,451 --> 01:32:47,890
a tremendous amount of stress to carry
with yourself through these last six or

3194
01:32:47,891 --> 01:32:48,490
so months.

3195
01:32:48,490 --> 01:32:50,350
Well I hope she gets past
that cause she's a lot of fun.

3196
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:51,273
She's,

3197
01:32:51,310 --> 01:32:53,140
I like her a lot and
I got to tell you man,

3198
01:32:53,141 --> 01:32:54,970
it's one of the most satisfying things.

3199
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,220
Again going back to the
golden snitch thing,

3200
01:32:57,400 --> 01:33:00,520
really my role here is as an advocate,

3201
01:33:01,270 --> 01:33:04,060
someone who looks out for
athletes and situations like that.

3202
01:33:04,060 --> 01:33:08,050
There's been other things that that
we do is look when we put this program

3203
01:33:08,051 --> 01:33:08,884
together,

3204
01:33:08,980 --> 01:33:10,090
the Sada program,

3205
01:33:10,120 --> 01:33:10,990
it was,

3206
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:11,360
it's,

3207
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:12,400
it's unprecedented.

3208
01:33:12,401 --> 01:33:15,550
There's no other professional sport
that has the comprehensiveness of the

3209
01:33:15,551 --> 01:33:16,384
program.

3210
01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:18,380
There's also no other professional sport.

3211
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:23,400
It's quite put together like the UFC is
in terms of you have individual athletes

3212
01:33:23,681 --> 01:33:26,350
that you know are competing
against each other.

3213
01:33:26,351 --> 01:33:28,840
It's not a team sport worth
one person tests positive.

3214
01:33:28,841 --> 01:33:31,000
You have another person
you know to step on in.

3215
01:33:31,540 --> 01:33:35,710
So a lot of what I've done over those
first couple of years is take a look at,

3216
01:33:35,850 --> 01:33:36,100
you know,

3217
01:33:36,100 --> 01:33:36,251
hey,

3218
01:33:36,251 --> 01:33:36,670
we took,

3219
01:33:36,670 --> 01:33:39,160
we think it was a pretty good
shot at the rules to begin with.

3220
01:33:39,161 --> 01:33:41,890
But look and see how those
rules played themselves out.

3221
01:33:41,891 --> 01:33:44,680
As time went on and after
about a year and a half,

3222
01:33:44,681 --> 01:33:46,270
there were a couple instances where I saw,

3223
01:33:46,271 --> 01:33:46,780
hey,

3224
01:33:46,780 --> 01:33:49,300
this isn't quite fair to an athlete.

3225
01:33:49,300 --> 01:33:50,200
We need to change that.

3226
01:33:50,201 --> 01:33:50,711
We did.

3227
01:33:50,711 --> 01:33:51,730
So after a year and a half,

3228
01:33:51,731 --> 01:33:53,290
there was a couple rules that we change.

3229
01:33:53,800 --> 01:33:54,371
The first one,

3230
01:33:54,371 --> 01:33:55,960
there's kind of a funny
story behind this too,

3231
01:33:56,470 --> 01:33:58,960
was on if you remember
when Nate fought Conor,

3232
01:33:58,961 --> 01:34:03,820
I think the second time he goes to the
press conference after it takes out a

3233
01:34:03,821 --> 01:34:04,610
vape pen.

3234
01:34:04,610 --> 01:34:05,443
Do you remember that?

3235
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:09,250
And someone asked him what he was
doing and he said he was with CBD.

3236
01:34:09,850 --> 01:34:12,610
And at the time though,

3237
01:34:12,640 --> 01:34:16,930
the rule was the in competition
period where CBD was prohibited,

3238
01:34:17,380 --> 01:34:20,350
lasted until four hours after
the conclusion of the fight.

3239
01:34:20,351 --> 01:34:22,630
And he was clearly
within that time period.

3240
01:34:23,380 --> 01:34:25,540
So you saw the contacted me and said,

3241
01:34:25,541 --> 01:34:25,870
hey,

3242
01:34:25,870 --> 01:34:26,200
you know,

3243
01:34:26,200 --> 01:34:28,270
technically Nate was in violation of this.

3244
01:34:28,271 --> 01:34:29,350
And I said,

3245
01:34:29,351 --> 01:34:29,501
hey,

3246
01:34:29,501 --> 01:34:30,334
look,

3247
01:34:30,430 --> 01:34:32,590
this was not the intent
of the rule of this is,

3248
01:34:32,620 --> 01:34:32,861
you know,

3249
01:34:32,861 --> 01:34:35,230
and they never indicated that
they were going to sanction him,

3250
01:34:35,260 --> 01:34:36,880
but I made it clear to say,

3251
01:34:36,881 --> 01:34:40,270
explain CBD for anybody that might
not know what we're talking about.

3252
01:34:40,300 --> 01:34:40,720
Sure.

3253
01:34:40,720 --> 01:34:42,430
So CBD part of the,

3254
01:34:42,460 --> 01:34:42,761
you know,

3255
01:34:42,761 --> 01:34:45,640
the marijuana plant but is
not psychoactive part of it.

3256
01:34:46,090 --> 01:34:46,720
Um,

3257
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:49,780
I know a lot of our
fighters anecdotally use it,

3258
01:34:50,110 --> 01:34:50,560
um,

3259
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:53,350
for anti-inflammatory PR purposes.

3260
01:34:53,830 --> 01:34:54,730
Um,

3261
01:34:54,790 --> 01:34:55,181
I think,

3262
01:34:55,181 --> 01:34:55,361
I mean,

3263
01:34:55,361 --> 01:34:59,060
have you ever used it or
what benefits is a anxiety?

3264
01:34:59,900 --> 01:35:00,210
It's,

3265
01:35:00,210 --> 01:35:02,120
it's great for people
that are under stress.

3266
01:35:02,150 --> 01:35:02,451
It,

3267
01:35:02,451 --> 01:35:02,631
uh,

3268
01:35:02,631 --> 01:35:02,850
it,

3269
01:35:02,850 --> 01:35:04,970
it actually has a great response for that.

3270
01:35:04,971 --> 01:35:07,040
I know a lot of people that
use it just for anxiety.

3271
01:35:07,330 --> 01:35:07,800
Um,

3272
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:09,550
but anti-inflammation is,

3273
01:35:09,620 --> 01:35:10,281
is a big one.

3274
01:35:10,281 --> 01:35:10,881
That's the big one.

3275
01:35:10,881 --> 01:35:12,560
People use it for people with arthritis.

3276
01:35:12,620 --> 01:35:13,250
Love it.

3277
01:35:13,250 --> 01:35:13,461
Yeah.

3278
01:35:13,461 --> 01:35:13,761
Again,

3279
01:35:13,761 --> 01:35:14,610
comparing to,

3280
01:35:14,670 --> 01:35:14,851
you know,

3281
01:35:14,851 --> 01:35:17,810
a natural plant derived
product versus a synthetic,

3282
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:18,201
you know,

3283
01:35:18,201 --> 01:35:22,760
nonsteroidal antiinflammatory
Advils Tylenol's can be toxic on.

3284
01:35:22,770 --> 01:35:23,300
Yeah.

3285
01:35:23,300 --> 01:35:24,410
Probably Common Sense.

3286
01:35:24,411 --> 01:35:25,490
Would would,

3287
01:35:25,640 --> 01:35:26,060
you know,

3288
01:35:26,060 --> 01:35:28,940
in addition to science would say that
the CBD is maybe a little bit healthier

3289
01:35:28,941 --> 01:35:29,774
for you.

3290
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:30,260
Um,

3291
01:35:30,260 --> 01:35:32,450
nevertheless it was
prohibited in competition.

3292
01:35:32,480 --> 01:35:33,290
Is it still?

3293
01:35:33,290 --> 01:35:33,620
No.

3294
01:35:33,620 --> 01:35:35,060
So that was actually a rule change.

3295
01:35:35,390 --> 01:35:36,223
The water,

3296
01:35:36,410 --> 01:35:37,040
um,

3297
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:37,731
prohibited list,

3298
01:35:37,731 --> 01:35:38,471
which we follow,

3299
01:35:38,471 --> 01:35:39,710
took it completely off.

3300
01:35:39,800 --> 01:35:40,920
The prohibited list started.

3301
01:35:40,921 --> 01:35:41,330
It's amazing.

3302
01:35:41,330 --> 01:35:42,950
2018 so that's great.

3303
01:35:42,980 --> 01:35:45,640
So we can just take CBD the entire time.

3304
01:35:45,660 --> 01:35:46,250
The training,

3305
01:35:46,250 --> 01:35:46,821
there's no,

3306
01:35:46,821 --> 01:35:48,710
it's obviously there's
no performance benefit,

3307
01:35:48,980 --> 01:35:50,390
there's no psychoactive effect.

3308
01:35:50,391 --> 01:35:53,000
It just reduces inflammation and
it doesn't have a natural way,

3309
01:35:53,240 --> 01:35:53,961
way healthier.

3310
01:35:53,961 --> 01:35:55,820
And it was the case before
they can do it in training.

3311
01:35:55,821 --> 01:35:57,470
It was only prohibited in competition.

3312
01:35:57,471 --> 01:35:59,120
So weigh in day and fight day.

3313
01:35:59,121 --> 01:36:02,290
Now it's completely been taken off the
list and it's okay to use it anytime.

3314
01:36:02,300 --> 01:36:03,260
That's fantastic.

3315
01:36:03,320 --> 01:36:04,131
That's fantastic.

3316
01:36:04,131 --> 01:36:04,821
So it was good.

3317
01:36:04,821 --> 01:36:05,091
So,

3318
01:36:05,091 --> 01:36:06,940
but we identified a problem with,

3319
01:36:06,941 --> 01:36:09,590
with the rules in that
when Nate finished that,

3320
01:36:09,591 --> 01:36:10,880
that fight with Conor,

3321
01:36:11,270 --> 01:36:11,720
you sought it,

3322
01:36:11,720 --> 01:36:14,000
came to the post fight medical tent said,

3323
01:36:14,001 --> 01:36:14,230
Nate,

3324
01:36:14,230 --> 01:36:15,530
we need to make a collection from you.

3325
01:36:15,530 --> 01:36:16,910
And I don't know whether
it was blood or urine,

3326
01:36:16,911 --> 01:36:18,560
but they got a sample from him.

3327
01:36:19,070 --> 01:36:22,130
He then went to the press
conference after and it was on,

3328
01:36:22,340 --> 01:36:22,551
you know,

3329
01:36:22,551 --> 01:36:23,510
took the CVD.

3330
01:36:23,900 --> 01:36:24,950
What I said is,

3331
01:36:25,010 --> 01:36:25,370
look,

3332
01:36:25,370 --> 01:36:26,780
you can't punish him.

3333
01:36:26,900 --> 01:36:29,480
You have the sample that
shows what was in his system.

3334
01:36:29,481 --> 01:36:29,711
Yes,

3335
01:36:29,711 --> 01:36:31,940
CBD was prohibited in competition,

3336
01:36:31,941 --> 01:36:34,190
but you have a sample to show
whether or not he was using it.

3337
01:36:34,580 --> 01:36:35,870
It's clear that you know,

3338
01:36:35,871 --> 01:36:37,160
he was using it after the fight.

3339
01:36:37,161 --> 01:36:41,450
We just put those extra four hours in
there with a thought of if a fight or

3340
01:36:41,451 --> 01:36:44,720
finishes a fight and somehow you
saw it as not able to get to him,

3341
01:36:44,990 --> 01:36:46,580
say gets in the ambulance right away.

3342
01:36:46,581 --> 01:36:47,660
It goes to the hospital.

3343
01:36:47,900 --> 01:36:50,630
You increase that window just
in case they can't get them.

3344
01:36:50,970 --> 01:36:51,771
Come to find out.

3345
01:36:51,771 --> 01:36:53,570
As we started putting
this program together,

3346
01:36:53,571 --> 01:36:53,920
you saw it.

3347
01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:56,390
It can always get to that fight
or after if they're transported,

3348
01:36:56,391 --> 01:37:00,290
they can hop in the ambulance with them
and it wasn't an issue where we needed

3349
01:37:00,291 --> 01:37:01,520
those extra four months.

3350
01:37:01,910 --> 01:37:03,080
So we changed that rule.

3351
01:37:03,290 --> 01:37:05,120
And now I'm basically,

3352
01:37:05,121 --> 01:37:09,860
the rule is the in competition period
ends with a collection immediately after

3353
01:37:09,861 --> 01:37:11,540
the fight or you know,

3354
01:37:11,541 --> 01:37:11,901
you saw it,

3355
01:37:11,901 --> 01:37:14,000
it has a reasonable amount
of time after the fight.

3356
01:37:14,410 --> 01:37:15,080
Um,

3357
01:37:15,080 --> 01:37:16,490
so the funny thing is,

3358
01:37:17,030 --> 01:37:17,480
uh,

3359
01:37:17,480 --> 01:37:18,890
after we changed this rule,

3360
01:37:19,190 --> 01:37:22,300
Nate and Nick Diaz come to
a fight and they're sitting,

3361
01:37:22,660 --> 01:37:23,840
call it the zoo for section,

3362
01:37:23,930 --> 01:37:24,200
you know,

3363
01:37:24,200 --> 01:37:26,480
Kinda Dana's section right
there behind Dana's table.

3364
01:37:26,930 --> 01:37:29,120
So I go over to nick and Nate and I said,

3365
01:37:29,121 --> 01:37:29,481
hey Nate,

3366
01:37:29,481 --> 01:37:29,790
man,

3367
01:37:29,790 --> 01:37:30,320
uh,

3368
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:30,471
hey,

3369
01:37:30,471 --> 01:37:31,610
we changed that rule,

3370
01:37:31,670 --> 01:37:32,330
you know,

3371
01:37:32,330 --> 01:37:33,440
the whole CBD thing.

3372
01:37:33,441 --> 01:37:35,210
And actually we kind of refer to it as,

3373
01:37:35,211 --> 01:37:36,440
as the Nate Diaz rule.

3374
01:37:36,980 --> 01:37:39,530
And when the Diaz brothers ratified,

3375
01:37:39,531 --> 01:37:41,360
I mean it's pandemonium and chaos.

3376
01:37:41,361 --> 01:37:43,430
Everybody's yelling their
name and I literally,

3377
01:37:43,431 --> 01:37:43,701
I'm like,

3378
01:37:43,701 --> 01:37:44,960
I have the demon registered with them.

3379
01:37:44,961 --> 01:37:45,710
He didn't look at me,

3380
01:37:45,710 --> 01:37:46,820
he was looking somewhere else.

3381
01:37:47,660 --> 01:37:49,070
So about a month later,

3382
01:37:49,610 --> 01:37:50,030
Nate,

3383
01:37:50,030 --> 01:37:50,421
I see him,

3384
01:37:50,421 --> 01:37:50,930
I'm in,

3385
01:37:50,930 --> 01:37:51,770
I think it was in Vegas.

3386
01:37:51,771 --> 01:37:53,930
I'm in the kind of walk out
10 hole and here comes Nate.

3387
01:37:54,290 --> 01:37:55,020
So he sees me,

3388
01:37:55,020 --> 01:37:55,860
he comes over me,

3389
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:56,160
gives

3390
01:37:56,160 --> 01:37:57,390
me kind of the bro Hug,

3391
01:37:57,391 --> 01:37:58,224
what's up,

3392
01:37:58,590 --> 01:38:01,350
he's with Yancey Mendez
and so against the,

3393
01:38:01,351 --> 01:38:06,330
and I started talking and Yancy beyond
being just an unbelievably entertaining

3394
01:38:06,331 --> 01:38:06,751
fighters.

3395
01:38:06,751 --> 01:38:08,100
One of the best dudes on the roster.

3396
01:38:08,101 --> 01:38:08,491
Great Guy.

3397
01:38:08,491 --> 01:38:09,510
So I'm talking against,

3398
01:38:09,511 --> 01:38:10,500
he all the sudden Nico's,

3399
01:38:10,680 --> 01:38:12,390
hey Jeff man,

3400
01:38:12,391 --> 01:38:14,310
tell Yancey about my usada rule.

3401
01:38:15,050 --> 01:38:17,040
I've got a sata rule named after me dog.

3402
01:38:18,570 --> 01:38:19,261
And so I thought,

3403
01:38:19,261 --> 01:38:19,501
man,

3404
01:38:19,501 --> 01:38:23,590
you're doing something right when Nate
Diaz is like excited about a change in

3405
01:38:23,591 --> 01:38:24,271
that you sought a rule,

3406
01:38:24,271 --> 01:38:24,720
right?

3407
01:38:24,720 --> 01:38:24,961
Yeah.

3408
01:38:24,961 --> 01:38:25,480
That is a,

3409
01:38:25,480 --> 01:38:26,670
that is a very good rule.

3410
01:38:26,700 --> 01:38:27,750
I'm really excited about that.

3411
01:38:27,870 --> 01:38:28,703
Um,

3412
01:38:29,010 --> 01:38:30,180
what's the story with neck?

3413
01:38:30,300 --> 01:38:31,290
He can't fight?

3414
01:38:31,410 --> 01:38:32,770
Is he still have like some sort of a,

3415
01:38:32,771 --> 01:38:33,260
so yeah,

3416
01:38:33,260 --> 01:38:34,940
Nicholas will,

3417
01:38:34,980 --> 01:38:37,380
nick was our first fire that
ran into the whereabouts issue.

3418
01:38:37,560 --> 01:38:38,970
So he got three whereabouts,

3419
01:38:38,971 --> 01:38:40,950
failures and a rolling 12 months.

3420
01:38:40,951 --> 01:38:43,920
So he's currently going
through that process.

3421
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:44,490
You know,

3422
01:38:44,490 --> 01:38:46,770
it's a tough one cause
I don't want to fight.

3423
01:38:47,460 --> 01:38:48,330
I think he does.

3424
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:49,291
I think he does.

3425
01:38:49,291 --> 01:38:50,040
I mean we've,

3426
01:38:50,040 --> 01:38:53,010
and I've sat down with him over the last
couple months and talking about trying

3427
01:38:53,011 --> 01:38:54,420
to resolve this whereabouts issue.

3428
01:38:54,421 --> 01:38:58,920
I mean the unfortunate thing there is
look the whereabouts failure sanctions are

3429
01:38:58,921 --> 01:39:01,950
meant to catch people that are
cheating and trying to avoid testing.

3430
01:39:01,951 --> 01:39:06,951
And I just think Nick's lifestyle led
to those three kind of whereabouts,

3431
01:39:07,171 --> 01:39:09,150
not that he was trying to avoid testing.

3432
01:39:09,220 --> 01:39:09,960
Um,

3433
01:39:09,960 --> 01:39:10,793
nick being nick,

3434
01:39:10,830 --> 01:39:11,240
we're trying.

3435
01:39:11,240 --> 01:39:11,580
Yeah,

3436
01:39:11,580 --> 01:39:12,540
we're trying to work through that.

3437
01:39:12,541 --> 01:39:12,810
He,

3438
01:39:12,810 --> 01:39:13,111
you know,

3439
01:39:13,111 --> 01:39:13,944
he put,

3440
01:39:14,310 --> 01:39:17,700
he trusted certain individuals
to do his whereabouts for him.

3441
01:39:17,790 --> 01:39:18,120
Um,

3442
01:39:18,120 --> 01:39:21,300
I think is what happened over time and
those individuals would come in and out

3443
01:39:21,301 --> 01:39:22,770
of his life and of course,

3444
01:39:22,771 --> 01:39:25,410
kind of unbeknownst to him that he
was missing a lot of these things,

3445
01:39:25,411 --> 01:39:26,011
never less,

3446
01:39:26,011 --> 01:39:26,281
you know,

3447
01:39:26,281 --> 01:39:26,431
the,

3448
01:39:26,431 --> 01:39:26,731
again,

3449
01:39:26,731 --> 01:39:30,540
there's strict liability here and
it's currently under sanction,

3450
01:39:30,541 --> 01:39:33,060
but we're hoping to resolve
that pretty quick now.

3451
01:39:33,080 --> 01:39:33,390
Uh,

3452
01:39:33,390 --> 01:39:34,350
last time we,

3453
01:39:34,360 --> 01:39:35,160
you were on,

3454
01:39:35,160 --> 01:39:36,630
you talked about this,

3455
01:39:36,631 --> 01:39:41,631
a new potential testosterone that was
derived from animals and that there might

3456
01:39:42,601 --> 01:39:46,680
be a way that people could take
this stuff and go undetected.

3457
01:39:47,130 --> 01:39:47,521
Yeah.

3458
01:39:47,521 --> 01:39:47,731
I mean,

3459
01:39:47,731 --> 01:39:50,370
I haven't heard much
about that since then.

3460
01:39:50,430 --> 01:39:51,240
Um,

3461
01:39:51,240 --> 01:39:53,240
was it just a theoretical?

3462
01:39:53,340 --> 01:39:53,760
No,

3463
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:54,870
now it's out there.

3464
01:39:54,900 --> 01:39:55,550
It's real.

3465
01:39:55,550 --> 01:39:56,100
Um,

3466
01:39:56,100 --> 01:39:56,760
but you know,

3467
01:39:56,760 --> 01:39:57,241
again,

3468
01:39:57,241 --> 01:40:01,350
some of the things that to combat that
or the biological passport program where

3469
01:40:01,351 --> 01:40:03,300
you're looking over time,

3470
01:40:03,301 --> 01:40:06,660
it's somebody t ratio
and even though that,

3471
01:40:06,750 --> 01:40:07,110
you know,

3472
01:40:07,110 --> 01:40:10,710
won't trigger a positive on the
isotope ratio mass spectrometry,

3473
01:40:10,711 --> 01:40:13,950
if you see wild variances
and t ratios over time,

3474
01:40:14,460 --> 01:40:15,750
that could potentially trigger,

3475
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:18,090
would there be a way to more violation,

3476
01:40:18,240 --> 01:40:18,610
sorry.

3477
01:40:18,610 --> 01:40:20,640
There was a way to mitigate that,

3478
01:40:20,750 --> 01:40:25,750
a biological passport thing by making a
specific time that you inject it every

3479
01:40:27,091 --> 01:40:29,250
day and doing it on a regular basis.

3480
01:40:29,250 --> 01:40:30,083
Like instead of,

3481
01:40:30,390 --> 01:40:30,811
I know,

3482
01:40:30,811 --> 01:40:31,320
um,

3483
01:40:31,320 --> 01:40:32,370
it was one of the ways that,

3484
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:32,940
uh,

3485
01:40:32,940 --> 01:40:36,150
some fighters have gotten caught is
that they knew they were going to be in

3486
01:40:36,151 --> 01:40:37,710
Vegas or something for
a long period of time.

3487
01:40:37,711 --> 01:40:39,200
So they couldn't take any and they,

3488
01:40:39,300 --> 01:40:40,410
maybe we'd take it twice a week.

3489
01:40:40,411 --> 01:40:44,490
So they doubled their dose and took it
in a one shot and then they got hit with

3490
01:40:44,491 --> 01:40:47,400
a random and then it showed
that they had this massive,

3491
01:40:47,690 --> 01:40:48,120
yeah,

3492
01:40:48,120 --> 01:40:49,080
it's a potential.

3493
01:40:49,081 --> 01:40:49,560
I mean,

3494
01:40:49,560 --> 01:40:49,801
you know,

3495
01:40:49,801 --> 01:40:54,190
someone who has the resources
and sophisticated and
somebody has someone who's

3496
01:40:54,191 --> 01:40:55,840
educated in chemistry.

3497
01:40:56,320 --> 01:40:56,680
Um,

3498
01:40:56,680 --> 01:40:57,020
it's,

3499
01:40:57,020 --> 01:40:59,170
it's definitely a cat and
mouse game anti-doping.

3500
01:40:59,171 --> 01:41:00,010
And you know,

3501
01:41:00,040 --> 01:41:00,700
um,

3502
01:41:00,700 --> 01:41:02,560
Vogel talked about that
when he was on here.

3503
01:41:02,561 --> 01:41:03,394
I mean the,

3504
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:06,190
the premise of ICARUS
initially it was right,

3505
01:41:06,191 --> 01:41:08,950
he was going to show that
that anti-doping doesn't work.

3506
01:41:09,490 --> 01:41:11,020
And it was actually something I was,

3507
01:41:11,160 --> 01:41:13,930
I watched your podcast with them
and watch the movie as well.

3508
01:41:13,930 --> 01:41:18,130
And initially I was a little bit turned
off on that premise cause he gave,

3509
01:41:18,190 --> 01:41:20,230
he gave the examples of Armstrong.

3510
01:41:20,260 --> 01:41:21,460
Marion Jones just said,

3511
01:41:21,461 --> 01:41:21,641
look,

3512
01:41:21,641 --> 01:41:25,120
anti-doping just doesn't work and I'm
going to go out and prove that that

3513
01:41:25,121 --> 01:41:25,731
doesn't make any sense.

3514
01:41:25,731 --> 01:41:27,400
If both those people
got busted that right.

3515
01:41:27,401 --> 01:41:28,121
That's the reality.

3516
01:41:28,121 --> 01:41:29,530
But look how they did.

3517
01:41:29,740 --> 01:41:33,250
They got busted through the investigative
element of anti-doping and that's

3518
01:41:33,251 --> 01:41:36,100
what's something that was learned and
came out of I think the investigations I

3519
01:41:36,101 --> 01:41:38,440
was involved in and all,

3520
01:41:38,470 --> 01:41:38,711
you know,

3521
01:41:38,711 --> 01:41:39,700
you started does this,

3522
01:41:39,701 --> 01:41:40,810
water does this.

3523
01:41:42,070 --> 01:41:44,170
The drug testing is not enough.

3524
01:41:44,290 --> 01:41:44,980
You know,

3525
01:41:44,980 --> 01:41:46,780
drug testing is a necessity.

3526
01:41:46,781 --> 01:41:47,650
You need to have that,

3527
01:41:47,651 --> 01:41:50,620
but you also need to have a
strong investigative element.

3528
01:41:50,980 --> 01:41:55,150
You have to liaison and you sought a
does this with law enforcement throughout

3529
01:41:55,151 --> 01:41:55,984
the world.

3530
01:41:56,110 --> 01:41:56,770
Um,

3531
01:41:56,770 --> 01:41:59,980
so that if you can't catch somebody
because they're sophisticated in the

3532
01:41:59,981 --> 01:42:01,180
techniques they're using,

3533
01:42:01,590 --> 01:42:01,870
you know,

3534
01:42:01,870 --> 01:42:03,280
maybe you catch them through,

3535
01:42:03,460 --> 01:42:03,851
you know,

3536
01:42:03,851 --> 01:42:06,610
informants or other
investigative resources.

3537
01:42:06,690 --> 01:42:07,390
Pressure.

3538
01:42:07,390 --> 01:42:08,223
Exactly.

3539
01:42:08,320 --> 01:42:11,470
Now that documentary blew my mind.

3540
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:12,161
It was incredible.

3541
01:42:12,161 --> 01:42:13,570
For people who haven't seen it.

3542
01:42:13,571 --> 01:42:14,470
It's on Netflix,

3543
01:42:14,471 --> 01:42:15,370
it's called ICARUS.

3544
01:42:15,371 --> 01:42:17,560
It's by Bryan Fogel and the documentary.

3545
01:42:17,561 --> 01:42:20,100
The premise was he was a guy who was a,

3546
01:42:20,101 --> 01:42:25,101
a cyclist and decided to compete in a
race first clean and then come back and do

3547
01:42:25,421 --> 01:42:30,160
it again under the assistance of a guy
who was an expert in anti-doping that

3548
01:42:30,161 --> 01:42:30,701
showed him like,

3549
01:42:30,701 --> 01:42:33,220
what's the stuff that you should
take right along the line?

3550
01:42:33,221 --> 01:42:35,170
He makes friends with this Guy Gregory,

3551
01:42:35,190 --> 01:42:36,023
how do you say his last name?

3552
01:42:36,040 --> 01:42:36,190
Right.

3553
01:42:36,190 --> 01:42:36,820
Check off,

3554
01:42:36,820 --> 01:42:37,653
something like that.

3555
01:42:37,870 --> 01:42:38,560
Um,

3556
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:43,560
and during this time period
it's discovered that the
entire Soviet Olympic team

3557
01:42:46,991 --> 01:42:49,960
is on steroids and that they
cheated during the games.

3558
01:42:49,961 --> 01:42:54,961
It's Sochi and he explains how they did
it and then the investigation comes down

3559
01:42:55,301 --> 01:42:58,000
and the guy has to flee Russia
and then he comes to America.

3560
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,220
He goes into protective
custody and Bryan Fogel just,

3561
01:43:00,520 --> 01:43:03,310
you talk about like just stepping in shit.

3562
01:43:03,311 --> 01:43:04,061
Holy smokes.

3563
01:43:04,061 --> 01:43:05,140
Did he come across on many,

3564
01:43:05,141 --> 01:43:09,860
did an awesome job of telling the story
and this Gregory God and making him kind

3565
01:43:09,861 --> 01:43:11,410
of the sympathetic character.

3566
01:43:11,411 --> 01:43:14,610
Yet he was the kind of the evil villain
that was doing all this over in Russia

3567
01:43:14,620 --> 01:43:15,670
was just incredible.

3568
01:43:16,380 --> 01:43:17,560
A movie.

3569
01:43:17,830 --> 01:43:20,170
The one thing that he didn't
cover too much in the movie,

3570
01:43:20,171 --> 01:43:23,770
it was a little bit disappointed is
who really the true heroes were of that

3571
01:43:23,771 --> 01:43:24,341
whole thing.

3572
01:43:24,341 --> 01:43:29,341
So there was a husband and wife couple
the tally and Yuliya Stepanova and um,

3573
01:43:31,630 --> 01:43:36,630
Yulia was an 800 meter runner for Russia
and Vitaly actually worked for Rosado.

3574
01:43:37,750 --> 01:43:42,750
The Russian anti-doping organization has
a drug collecting officer and they were

3575
01:43:43,181 --> 01:43:48,181
the ones basically that caused this German
documentary to come out exposing what

3576
01:43:48,550 --> 01:43:49,750
Gregory was doing.

3577
01:43:50,320 --> 01:43:52,100
And then at that of time the heat came

3578
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:56,030
on Gregory because this information was
out there and he was either forced to

3579
01:43:56,150 --> 01:43:57,500
stay there and likely be,

3580
01:43:57,820 --> 01:43:58,100
you know,

3581
01:43:58,100 --> 01:44:00,800
arrested and put the blame on or flee,

3582
01:44:01,200 --> 01:44:01,850
um,

3583
01:44:01,850 --> 01:44:04,460
to the u s it was dealt with
very briefly in that movie.

3584
01:44:04,461 --> 01:44:07,220
But those two I think were
the true heroes because,

3585
01:44:07,560 --> 01:44:07,820
you know,

3586
01:44:07,820 --> 01:44:10,040
they just did this cause it
was the right thing to do.

3587
01:44:10,490 --> 01:44:10,880
Um,

3588
01:44:10,880 --> 01:44:11,713
Gregory did it,

3589
01:44:11,720 --> 01:44:11,961
you know,

3590
01:44:11,961 --> 01:44:15,470
obviously with a lot of self preservation
in mind and that he had one of two

3591
01:44:15,471 --> 01:44:16,304
choices.

3592
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:20,030
Either take off and come clean or
stay there and face the consequences.

3593
01:44:20,390 --> 01:44:21,320
But never less man.

3594
01:44:21,321 --> 01:44:21,980
Fogel did.

3595
01:44:21,980 --> 01:44:23,630
I thought an awesome job in that movie.

3596
01:44:23,631 --> 01:44:25,430
And just an incredible,

3597
01:44:25,460 --> 01:44:26,480
incredible story.

3598
01:44:26,481 --> 01:44:26,950
And it's,

3599
01:44:26,950 --> 01:44:27,783
it's really,

3600
01:44:28,190 --> 01:44:28,850
um,

3601
01:44:28,850 --> 01:44:29,330
you know,

3602
01:44:29,330 --> 01:44:29,721
tough,

3603
01:44:29,721 --> 01:44:31,730
I'm sure for Olympic athletes to say,

3604
01:44:31,790 --> 01:44:32,091
God,

3605
01:44:32,091 --> 01:44:32,271
man,

3606
01:44:32,271 --> 01:44:32,770
this is what,

3607
01:44:32,770 --> 01:44:36,500
what we're up against when you're talking
about state sponsored doping and the

3608
01:44:36,501 --> 01:44:38,240
KGB being involved.

3609
01:44:38,740 --> 01:44:41,420
And there's almost a sense of
hopelessness out there that,

3610
01:44:41,450 --> 01:44:41,721
you know,

3611
01:44:41,721 --> 01:44:44,120
how am I ever know that
I'm as a clean athlete,

3612
01:44:44,180 --> 01:44:44,451
you know,

3613
01:44:44,451 --> 01:44:45,920
my rights are going to be protected.

3614
01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:46,821
Again,

3615
01:44:46,821 --> 01:44:49,010
going back to what we're
doing with the UFC,

3616
01:44:49,430 --> 01:44:51,070
the beauty of what we're doing is you,

3617
01:44:51,130 --> 01:44:54,500
you can never see that because
you have an independent authority.

3618
01:44:54,540 --> 01:44:58,790
You sorta who's operating and
administering our program.

3619
01:44:59,180 --> 01:44:59,691
Um,

3620
01:44:59,691 --> 01:45:03,680
so unlike the Russian government where
they have interest of Russian athletes,

3621
01:45:03,681 --> 01:45:04,280
you know,

3622
01:45:04,280 --> 01:45:06,650
doing well and winning gold medals,

3623
01:45:06,980 --> 01:45:07,191
you know,

3624
01:45:07,191 --> 01:45:07,641
you saw it.

3625
01:45:07,641 --> 01:45:08,090
I could,

3626
01:45:08,090 --> 01:45:08,331
you know,

3627
01:45:08,331 --> 01:45:08,811
in a sense,

3628
01:45:08,811 --> 01:45:09,860
give a crap about,

3629
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:10,221
you know,

3630
01:45:10,221 --> 01:45:11,054
who's being,

3631
01:45:11,120 --> 01:45:12,760
who's being caught and isn't.

3632
01:45:13,310 --> 01:45:14,143
Um,

3633
01:45:14,270 --> 01:45:17,750
so one of the things that came up in the
film that was really disturbing was the

3634
01:45:17,751 --> 01:45:22,280
collusion between water and
the IOC and that they really,

3635
01:45:22,281 --> 01:45:24,530
it was in their best interest
to not sanction Russia.

3636
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:24,930
Yeah,

3637
01:45:24,930 --> 01:45:25,550
it's a con.

3638
01:45:25,550 --> 01:45:26,600
You have people sitting,

3639
01:45:26,630 --> 01:45:27,680
you still do on the,

3640
01:45:27,681 --> 01:45:29,960
on the water board and on the IOC board.

3641
01:45:29,961 --> 01:45:30,531
So there's,

3642
01:45:30,531 --> 01:45:33,230
there's a conflict of interest is
wada is going to come in and say,

3643
01:45:33,231 --> 01:45:36,350
hey this was clearly
state sponsored doping.

3644
01:45:36,410 --> 01:45:39,380
We're going to exclude Russia
from the Olympics for the next,

3645
01:45:39,820 --> 01:45:40,370
you know,

3646
01:45:40,370 --> 01:45:41,660
however many years.

3647
01:45:42,140 --> 01:45:45,830
Well that's a hit to the IOC cause IOC
is getting money from these television

3648
01:45:45,831 --> 01:45:49,880
networks putting on the Games
in Seoul or in Tokyo coming up.

3649
01:45:50,390 --> 01:45:51,021
So you know,

3650
01:45:51,021 --> 01:45:52,280
a conflict of interest there.

3651
01:45:52,460 --> 01:45:54,410
You saw it as a nonprofit organization.

3652
01:45:54,470 --> 01:45:55,430
So the UFC,

3653
01:45:55,700 --> 01:45:58,460
the UFC does pay them to
administer our program,

3654
01:45:58,730 --> 01:46:00,860
but it's not lining
the pockets of anybody.

3655
01:46:00,861 --> 01:46:03,680
They're CEOs not making more
money because of the UFC is here.

3656
01:46:03,681 --> 01:46:06,620
They maybe have a few more
personnel to administer the program,

3657
01:46:06,621 --> 01:46:07,760
but you know,

3658
01:46:07,850 --> 01:46:08,270
if,

3659
01:46:08,270 --> 01:46:09,410
if we go away,

3660
01:46:09,590 --> 01:46:10,920
you saw is still in existence.

3661
01:46:10,920 --> 01:46:13,040
They're still doing Olympic
testing and you know,

3662
01:46:13,280 --> 01:46:14,690
nobody's pocket books are hurting.

3663
01:46:14,840 --> 01:46:15,201
Yeah.

3664
01:46:15,201 --> 01:46:17,780
That independence I think is critical.

3665
01:46:17,781 --> 01:46:19,100
And that's something that
you brought up earlier.

3666
01:46:19,101 --> 01:46:20,420
I think that's so awesome.

3667
01:46:20,450 --> 01:46:22,580
And you know what a
massive credit to the UFC,

3668
01:46:22,581 --> 01:46:25,550
they decided to do it this
way and not do it in house.

3669
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,370
Just take on your protocol
out of courage to do that.

3670
01:46:28,790 --> 01:46:31,370
And it takes a real commitment
to try to clean up the sport.

3671
01:46:31,640 --> 01:46:31,941
Um,

3672
01:46:31,941 --> 01:46:36,380
one of the things that was really
weird was like they banned some,

3673
01:46:36,890 --> 01:46:39,110
some teams from Russia,

3674
01:46:39,210 --> 01:46:42,530
like not all the sports but the sports
they band where like nobody gives a fuck

3675
01:46:42,531 --> 01:46:42,900
about what,

3676
01:46:42,900 --> 01:46:43,940
what the sports wear.

3677
01:46:44,110 --> 01:46:44,450
Yeah.

3678
01:46:44,450 --> 01:46:46,760
Well I think in reality
you could find out what,

3679
01:46:46,820 --> 01:46:47,750
what they banned,

3680
01:46:47,840 --> 01:46:49,710
they were going to ban the team,

3681
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:52,170
but the outrage from
that was just so strong.

3682
01:46:52,171 --> 01:46:56,040
And then they realize the economic
impact of that would be literally in the

3683
01:46:56,040 --> 01:46:56,850
billions of dollars.

3684
01:46:56,850 --> 01:46:59,070
But think they abandoned
track and field team from,

3685
01:46:59,100 --> 01:47:00,090
from Rio Games,

3686
01:47:00,091 --> 01:47:03,180
which is pretty significant track and
field being a pretty big Olympic sport.

3687
01:47:03,300 --> 01:47:04,270
There was a new hair,

3688
01:47:04,290 --> 01:47:05,940
Russia banned from Winter Olympics,

3689
01:47:05,941 --> 01:47:07,830
but clean athletes can compete.

3690
01:47:07,831 --> 01:47:08,664
So this is new,

3691
01:47:08,700 --> 01:47:09,533
right?

3692
01:47:09,720 --> 01:47:13,380
Russia athletes make that a little
bigger for my fucking shitty eyes.

3693
01:47:14,190 --> 01:47:18,180
It Russia has been banned from the 2018
winter Olympics in South Korea over the

3694
01:47:18,181 --> 01:47:18,481
country.

3695
01:47:18,481 --> 01:47:20,640
Systematic manipulation
of anti-doping rules.

3696
01:47:20,641 --> 01:47:21,360
However,

3697
01:47:21,360 --> 01:47:22,750
Russian athletes who can prove,

3698
01:47:22,980 --> 01:47:24,210
prove that they are clean,

3699
01:47:24,390 --> 01:47:29,390
we'll be invited in in quotes to compete
in say that Pyong Chang Look at Jamie

3700
01:47:31,201 --> 01:47:32,640
was degree in Korean.

3701
01:47:33,030 --> 01:47:33,370
Uh,

3702
01:47:33,370 --> 01:47:36,360
the International Olympic
Committee said Tuesday,

3703
01:47:36,361 --> 01:47:37,141
so that's fascinating.

3704
01:47:37,141 --> 01:47:37,650
So they'll,

3705
01:47:37,650 --> 01:47:41,550
they'll be literally competing
under the Olympic flag,

3706
01:47:41,580 --> 01:47:42,450
which is like woo.

3707
01:47:43,140 --> 01:47:48,140
It's the most wide ranging punishment
ever met it out by the IOC in a party on a

3708
01:47:48,421 --> 01:47:49,470
participating nation,

3709
01:47:49,471 --> 01:47:51,840
let alone a powerhouse
of the Olympic movement.

3710
01:47:52,270 --> 01:47:52,451
Yeah,

3711
01:47:52,451 --> 01:47:52,720
I mean,

3712
01:47:52,720 --> 01:47:54,070
you're competing on the Olympic flag,

3713
01:47:54,071 --> 01:47:57,440
but everybody's still gonna know the
commentators are going still gonna say the

3714
01:47:57,460 --> 01:47:59,530
Russian athletes competing
on the Olympic flag.

3715
01:47:59,690 --> 01:48:00,431
That's bizarre.

3716
01:48:00,431 --> 01:48:00,820
Right?

3717
01:48:00,820 --> 01:48:01,301
Competing,

3718
01:48:01,301 --> 01:48:01,571
I mean,

3719
01:48:01,571 --> 01:48:02,860
is this unprecedented?

3720
01:48:03,460 --> 01:48:05,800
Someone competing under the Olympic flag?

3721
01:48:05,860 --> 01:48:07,260
I'm not sure whether it's happened before.

3722
01:48:07,270 --> 01:48:08,350
Not Man.

3723
01:48:08,770 --> 01:48:09,131
How's it?

3724
01:48:09,131 --> 01:48:11,110
I'm pretty sure I remember
just random people.

3725
01:48:11,140 --> 01:48:11,351
I don't,

3726
01:48:11,351 --> 01:48:14,350
they might not have had to country to
perform or their whole country might not

3727
01:48:14,351 --> 01:48:14,801
have sent them,

3728
01:48:14,801 --> 01:48:16,310
but they would qualify or something.

3729
01:48:16,720 --> 01:48:17,553
Okay.

3730
01:48:17,590 --> 01:48:18,100
Wow.

3731
01:48:18,100 --> 01:48:18,660
Crazy.

3732
01:48:18,660 --> 01:48:18,970
Um,

3733
01:48:18,970 --> 01:48:22,240
but there was also a
certain teams that were,

3734
01:48:22,270 --> 01:48:23,410
were kicked out of,

3735
01:48:23,420 --> 01:48:26,530
or certain gold metals
that were a rescinded,

3736
01:48:26,860 --> 01:48:29,260
but that was the other thing
that I thought was really
interesting about you saw

3737
01:48:29,261 --> 01:48:29,620
it as,

3738
01:48:29,620 --> 01:48:30,453
um,

3739
01:48:30,790 --> 01:48:34,030
protocol is that they freeze samples.

3740
01:48:34,390 --> 01:48:37,420
So just in case the testing
improves in the future,

3741
01:48:37,890 --> 01:48:39,260
he used to turn again,

3742
01:48:39,500 --> 01:48:40,100
it,

3743
01:48:40,100 --> 01:48:40,311
you know,

3744
01:48:40,311 --> 01:48:42,980
there's no denying it's a cat and
mouse game going on out there,

3745
01:48:42,981 --> 01:48:45,320
but a deterrent is that
it's not all of them,

3746
01:48:45,321 --> 01:48:47,900
but certain samples can
be frozen up to 10 years.

3747
01:48:48,350 --> 01:48:50,120
And as new tests come online,

3748
01:48:50,121 --> 01:48:52,370
like the longterm metabolite tests that,

3749
01:48:52,371 --> 01:48:52,730
uh,

3750
01:48:52,730 --> 01:48:55,460
Gregory developed after five or six years,

3751
01:48:55,461 --> 01:48:57,830
they may go back and retest those samples.

3752
01:48:57,831 --> 01:48:58,850
And you know,

3753
01:48:58,851 --> 01:49:00,350
when we go out and educate our athletes,

3754
01:49:00,351 --> 01:49:00,980
I tell them,

3755
01:49:00,980 --> 01:49:01,490
look,

3756
01:49:01,490 --> 01:49:02,960
maybe you're not in the UFC anymore,

3757
01:49:02,961 --> 01:49:05,270
but your legacies around
forever and you know,

3758
01:49:05,271 --> 01:49:07,040
that's a smear to your legacy forever.

3759
01:49:07,041 --> 01:49:09,170
And it's all about creating that.

3760
01:49:09,171 --> 01:49:10,004
My job,

3761
01:49:10,250 --> 01:49:11,270
I worked for the UFC,

3762
01:49:11,480 --> 01:49:13,040
my job is not,

3763
01:49:13,041 --> 01:49:13,191
hey,

3764
01:49:13,191 --> 01:49:14,690
let's see how many athletes we can catch.

3765
01:49:14,691 --> 01:49:17,120
My job is to try to get out there,

3766
01:49:17,270 --> 01:49:17,961
educate,

3767
01:49:17,961 --> 01:49:19,310
develop relationships,

3768
01:49:19,550 --> 01:49:21,020
and create that deterrent saying,

3769
01:49:21,021 --> 01:49:21,321
look,

3770
01:49:21,321 --> 01:49:22,490
you don't want to do this.

3771
01:49:22,491 --> 01:49:24,230
It's going to catch you eventually.

3772
01:49:24,530 --> 01:49:25,850
If you're going to do something,

3773
01:49:26,240 --> 01:49:29,300
I'll give you every resource
and bit of knowledge.

3774
01:49:29,301 --> 01:49:31,820
I have to make sure you're
successful under the program.

3775
01:49:32,120 --> 01:49:32,811
But you know,

3776
01:49:32,811 --> 01:49:36,380
success in my eyes is
very few positive tests.

3777
01:49:36,381 --> 01:49:36,800
I don't,

3778
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:37,270
you know,

3779
01:49:37,270 --> 01:49:38,001
right on the Kuwait,

3780
01:49:38,001 --> 01:49:40,580
the program with success
because we've had,

3781
01:49:40,581 --> 01:49:40,851
you know,

3782
01:49:40,851 --> 01:49:42,680
60 or so positives over time.

3783
01:49:42,681 --> 01:49:43,514
I'd love to see,

3784
01:49:43,880 --> 01:49:44,121
you know,

3785
01:49:44,121 --> 01:49:45,680
none and see more of that.

3786
01:49:45,681 --> 01:49:47,120
Those graph showing those,

3787
01:49:47,450 --> 01:49:47,770
you know,

3788
01:49:47,770 --> 01:49:48,190
common

3789
01:49:48,190 --> 01:49:48,971
markers of a,

3790
01:49:48,971 --> 01:49:50,860
of a doper come more into line.

3791
01:49:50,920 --> 01:49:51,131
Right.

3792
01:49:51,131 --> 01:49:54,400
You're not in the position of a
detective or a prosecutor anymore.

3793
01:49:54,401 --> 01:49:56,950
Your position is now an athlete liaison.

3794
01:49:57,010 --> 01:49:57,431
It is,

3795
01:49:57,431 --> 01:49:57,721
and it's,

3796
01:49:57,721 --> 01:49:58,660
it's a much different role.

3797
01:49:58,661 --> 01:49:59,650
There's a role I'd really,

3798
01:49:59,740 --> 01:50:00,573
I'd really enjoy.

3799
01:50:00,580 --> 01:50:01,720
It's probably a lot less stressful.

3800
01:50:01,750 --> 01:50:02,830
Definitely a lot stressful,

3801
01:50:02,831 --> 01:50:03,790
a lot less stressful.

3802
01:50:03,791 --> 01:50:04,301
And you know,

3803
01:50:04,301 --> 01:50:05,410
Dana says it all the time,

3804
01:50:05,450 --> 01:50:09,790
the importance level in the
UFC and MMA is off the charts.

3805
01:50:10,250 --> 01:50:10,690
I,

3806
01:50:10,690 --> 01:50:11,280
I,

3807
01:50:11,280 --> 01:50:14,700
I still have a strong belief in
ethics and sports and beliefs.

3808
01:50:14,701 --> 01:50:18,130
Sports are so good for kids
and teaching them life lessons.

3809
01:50:18,131 --> 01:50:19,210
It transcends sports.

3810
01:50:19,211 --> 01:50:19,511
My,

3811
01:50:19,511 --> 01:50:20,830
I have three daughters that,

3812
01:50:21,140 --> 01:50:21,470
you know,

3813
01:50:21,470 --> 01:50:23,020
played sports growing up.

3814
01:50:23,050 --> 01:50:24,190
A couple of them still do.

3815
01:50:24,191 --> 01:50:27,760
And I know when they get out into the
real world and that work environment,

3816
01:50:28,150 --> 01:50:28,691
there's nothing,

3817
01:50:28,691 --> 01:50:30,400
they can't handle it because
they've already handled it.

3818
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:31,233
And Sports,

3819
01:50:31,390 --> 01:50:33,310
they've run up against a
coach who's an asshole.

3820
01:50:33,311 --> 01:50:35,410
They'd run up against
teammates that are selfish.

3821
01:50:35,411 --> 01:50:36,640
They've had great,

3822
01:50:36,700 --> 01:50:37,420
you know,

3823
01:50:37,420 --> 01:50:39,640
occurrences when they've
worked well as a team.

3824
01:50:40,120 --> 01:50:43,060
All of that is going to come into
play to help them in their lives.

3825
01:50:43,061 --> 01:50:45,130
And when you introduce
something and something,

3826
01:50:45,131 --> 01:50:48,430
it's so pure and good
that's breaking the rules.

3827
01:50:48,850 --> 01:50:49,480
Um,

3828
01:50:49,480 --> 01:50:53,980
that short term mostly longterm
is not healthy for your sports,

3829
01:50:53,981 --> 01:50:55,690
is about to be healthy for you.

3830
01:50:55,691 --> 01:50:56,590
And at some level,

3831
01:50:56,800 --> 01:50:59,380
especially the way these performance
enhancing drugs are used,

3832
01:50:59,381 --> 01:51:01,060
they're not really
being used in a healthy,

3833
01:51:01,450 --> 01:51:02,201
healthy manner.

3834
01:51:02,201 --> 01:51:02,740
And,

3835
01:51:02,740 --> 01:51:03,400
um,

3836
01:51:03,400 --> 01:51:04,001
so yeah,

3837
01:51:04,001 --> 01:51:04,481
but I feel,

3838
01:51:04,481 --> 01:51:07,180
I feel very strongly and very positive
about what we're doing and the role that

3839
01:51:07,181 --> 01:51:07,840
I'm playing here.

3840
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:08,051
Well,

3841
01:51:08,051 --> 01:51:09,460
it's interesting that the UFC,

3842
01:51:09,461 --> 01:51:10,660
unlike a lot of sports,

3843
01:51:10,690 --> 01:51:10,981
the,

3844
01:51:10,981 --> 01:51:14,980
the history is pretty transparent
and the history of doping is also

3845
01:51:14,981 --> 01:51:15,730
pretransplant.

3846
01:51:15,730 --> 01:51:20,500
Like everybody's really aware of
what the wild west days where like,

3847
01:51:20,530 --> 01:51:20,891
I mean,

3848
01:51:20,891 --> 01:51:21,400
it's,

3849
01:51:21,400 --> 01:51:22,300
people talk about it,

3850
01:51:22,310 --> 01:51:23,200
they laugh about it.

3851
01:51:23,201 --> 01:51:23,680
It's,

3852
01:51:23,680 --> 01:51:24,370
it's sort of an,

3853
01:51:24,370 --> 01:51:27,910
it's not a secret at all in particular
as we were saying about pride.

3854
01:51:28,060 --> 01:51:28,590
Um,

3855
01:51:28,590 --> 01:51:29,740
but you know,

3856
01:51:29,830 --> 01:51:33,550
I think that ultimately
what sports should be about,

3857
01:51:33,580 --> 01:51:35,200
it should be about effort,

3858
01:51:35,470 --> 01:51:36,303
skill,

3859
01:51:36,340 --> 01:51:37,390
determination,

3860
01:51:37,420 --> 01:51:38,170
focus,

3861
01:51:38,170 --> 01:51:39,003
discipline.

3862
01:51:39,220 --> 01:51:40,750
And those are the lessons
that you could pass on.

3863
01:51:40,751 --> 01:51:42,220
Not who has the best pharmacist,

3864
01:51:42,221 --> 01:51:42,820
not,

3865
01:51:42,820 --> 01:51:43,031
you know,

3866
01:51:43,031 --> 01:51:46,570
not who has the best team of scientists
that can hide the results better.

3867
01:51:46,900 --> 01:51:49,840
And that's one of the more
disturbing things about it.

3868
01:51:49,841 --> 01:51:50,770
Gris or,

3869
01:51:50,820 --> 01:51:51,071
or,

3870
01:51:51,071 --> 01:51:53,980
or any of these other
things that have shown that,

3871
01:51:54,280 --> 01:51:54,850
you know,

3872
01:51:54,850 --> 01:51:59,620
there's systematic anti-doping or
are doping or state sponsored doping.

3873
01:51:59,910 --> 01:52:00,743
It's just,

3874
01:52:00,870 --> 01:52:02,440
it distorts the whole thing.

3875
01:52:02,441 --> 01:52:05,710
Like what a victory is or
why you've got some athletes,

3876
01:52:05,711 --> 01:52:08,350
it probably would have won
anyway if everybody was clean.

3877
01:52:08,350 --> 01:52:11,620
They might've been the best athlete
anyway and then they could have one.

3878
01:52:11,650 --> 01:52:12,670
Floyd Landis told me,

3879
01:52:12,730 --> 01:52:14,350
told me that all the time about lance,

3880
01:52:14,440 --> 01:52:19,440
he said that dude was the baddest ass
bicycle rider ever and take away all the

3881
01:52:19,721 --> 01:52:21,130
drugs that were taken in the sport.

3882
01:52:21,910 --> 01:52:23,560
He would have been the best writer ever.

3883
01:52:23,620 --> 01:52:24,760
He had something going on there,

3884
01:52:24,761 --> 01:52:27,610
but the reality was everybody
was using something men.

3885
01:52:27,980 --> 01:52:29,170
That's how fucked up sport.

3886
01:52:29,200 --> 01:52:29,770
Yeah.

3887
01:52:29,770 --> 01:52:30,940
I think I talked about this last time,

3888
01:52:30,941 --> 01:52:31,774
but I really,

3889
01:52:31,780 --> 01:52:32,080
you know,

3890
01:52:32,080 --> 01:52:33,340
people are surprised to hear this,

3891
01:52:33,341 --> 01:52:37,840
but I had a lot of compassion
and understanding for a
lot of these dopers after

3892
01:52:37,841 --> 01:52:38,980
they told me their stories.

3893
01:52:38,981 --> 01:52:39,814
I mean,

3894
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:41,020
you're a young kid,

3895
01:52:41,080 --> 01:52:42,910
vulnerable kid that you know,

3896
01:52:42,940 --> 01:52:43,960
wasn't really worldly,

3897
01:52:43,961 --> 01:52:45,920
that all your teenage life,

3898
01:52:45,950 --> 01:52:46,070
you

3899
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:50,750
aspire to go over to Europe and get on a
bike and compete and he's awesome races

3900
01:52:50,751 --> 01:52:52,130
and all of a sudden you're over there,

3901
01:52:52,131 --> 01:52:53,330
dropped off in a coach,

3902
01:52:53,630 --> 01:52:55,670
sitting in a room says you
want to stay here a kid.

3903
01:52:55,671 --> 01:52:57,960
Here's the program that were on Meth.

3904
01:52:57,980 --> 01:52:58,491
I heard one,

3905
01:52:58,491 --> 01:52:59,810
I heard a dozen of those stories,

3906
01:52:59,811 --> 01:53:00,890
grown men crying,

3907
01:53:00,950 --> 01:53:02,240
retelling those stories.

3908
01:53:02,780 --> 01:53:03,613
Um,

3909
01:53:03,620 --> 01:53:04,520
so yeah,

3910
01:53:04,521 --> 01:53:05,720
I mean I feel good about,

3911
01:53:05,870 --> 01:53:06,150
you know,

3912
01:53:06,150 --> 01:53:08,810
change in the culture
in this sport radically.

3913
01:53:09,430 --> 01:53:12,620
I would love to have a podcast with you
and lance sit down together and discuss

3914
01:53:12,621 --> 01:53:15,050
this now that the dust has
kind of settled and you know,

3915
01:53:15,051 --> 01:53:19,220
he's been pretty open about
it and transparent about
the whole process himself.

3916
01:53:19,280 --> 01:53:19,491
Yeah,

3917
01:53:19,491 --> 01:53:19,731
I mean,

3918
01:53:19,731 --> 01:53:21,260
I think the difference,

3919
01:53:21,350 --> 01:53:24,560
the difference that that he
has with everybody else is,

3920
01:53:24,620 --> 01:53:24,861
you know,

3921
01:53:24,861 --> 01:53:25,161
again,

3922
01:53:25,161 --> 01:53:29,600
this is back to [inaudible] contention
that they didn't catch lance is you look

3923
01:53:29,601 --> 01:53:31,940
back at his history and they did actually,

3924
01:53:31,941 --> 01:53:32,181
you know,

3925
01:53:32,181 --> 01:53:36,920
in 99 I think he had a
corticosteroid positive in 2001.

3926
01:53:36,980 --> 01:53:39,230
I think he had a test that showed,

3927
01:53:39,690 --> 01:53:40,311
um,

3928
01:53:40,311 --> 01:53:42,920
high likelihood of EPL use
that wasn't followed on.

3929
01:53:42,921 --> 01:53:47,921
But what he did is he became very powerful
in the sport and the International

3930
01:53:49,010 --> 01:53:49,380
Cycling Union was,

3931
01:53:49,380 --> 01:53:54,170
was corrupt and basically use that
power and wield it and they cover it up.

3932
01:53:54,680 --> 01:53:55,490
Um,

3933
01:53:55,490 --> 01:53:56,540
a lot of those tests

3934
01:53:58,340 --> 01:53:58,910
crazy.

3935
01:53:58,910 --> 01:53:59,631
It is crazy.

3936
01:53:59,631 --> 01:54:00,464
And it's a,

3937
01:54:00,710 --> 01:54:05,710
and the crazy thing about combat sports
is that we're not just talking about

3938
01:54:06,441 --> 01:54:07,760
crossing a finish line quicker.

3939
01:54:07,850 --> 01:54:10,550
We're talking about the ability to
deliver more damage on your opponent.

3940
01:54:11,300 --> 01:54:13,430
And that's why it's so critical
that people fight clean,

3941
01:54:13,460 --> 01:54:14,293
whole new level.

3942
01:54:14,300 --> 01:54:15,440
It's a completely different thing.

3943
01:54:15,840 --> 01:54:16,461
There's just really,

3944
01:54:16,461 --> 01:54:17,390
there's no comparison.

3945
01:54:17,990 --> 01:54:20,030
Now let's get into,

3946
01:54:20,090 --> 01:54:23,120
we briefly touched on weight cutting.

3947
01:54:23,690 --> 01:54:24,080
Um,

3948
01:54:24,080 --> 01:54:26,740
but I know that the UFC has
recognized that there's,

3949
01:54:26,810 --> 01:54:28,310
there's a real issue and,

3950
01:54:28,311 --> 01:54:28,730
um,

3951
01:54:28,730 --> 01:54:32,690
what steps have we taken to try to
mitigate the problems that are caused by

3952
01:54:32,691 --> 01:54:33,500
weight cutting?

3953
01:54:33,500 --> 01:54:34,040
Yeah,

3954
01:54:34,040 --> 01:54:34,810
it's interesting.

3955
01:54:34,810 --> 01:54:38,330
And another one of the reasons why I
love the performance institute and the

3956
01:54:38,331 --> 01:54:40,670
staff that we had there
and that before them.

3957
01:54:41,440 --> 01:54:45,140
And it really stemmed from the Usada
program where under the Wada Code you

3958
01:54:45,141 --> 01:54:46,460
banned the use of Ivs.

3959
01:54:47,060 --> 01:54:47,421
And so,

3960
01:54:47,421 --> 01:54:51,690
cause I was kind of the point person
obviously explained why ivy's or you know,

3961
01:54:51,860 --> 01:54:52,541
it goes back to the,

3962
01:54:52,541 --> 01:54:53,331
to the cyclist,

3963
01:54:53,331 --> 01:54:58,331
they were using ivs to basically flush
their system of drugs to manipulate their

3964
01:54:58,521 --> 01:55:00,260
bicycle biological passport.

3965
01:55:00,290 --> 01:55:03,670
So if their blood doping
or using EPO and um,

3966
01:55:03,800 --> 01:55:06,590
it would have a tendency
to lower those and,

3967
01:55:06,600 --> 01:55:09,260
and normalize those
biological passport levels.

3968
01:55:09,650 --> 01:55:12,590
And so a lot of learn that through
some of the investigations that,

3969
01:55:12,650 --> 01:55:13,100
you know,

3970
01:55:13,100 --> 01:55:16,180
they were conducted and
determined that ivy use,

3971
01:55:16,270 --> 01:55:16,551
um,

3972
01:55:16,551 --> 01:55:19,370
in excess of 50 milliliters,

3973
01:55:19,460 --> 01:55:21,140
every six hours would be prohibited.

3974
01:55:21,620 --> 01:55:24,860
So when we announced that we were
adopting the water prohibited list and

3975
01:55:24,861 --> 01:55:25,970
prohibited methods,

3976
01:55:26,360 --> 01:55:27,140
um,

3977
01:55:27,140 --> 01:55:27,890
there was some,

3978
01:55:27,890 --> 01:55:30,560
some blow back within
the UFC community saying,

3979
01:55:30,561 --> 01:55:31,280
hey,

3980
01:55:31,280 --> 01:55:34,790
these things are used regularly because
fighters are pushing themselves to the

3981
01:55:34,791 --> 01:55:37,910
edge to make weight and do you
understand what you're doing here?

3982
01:55:37,910 --> 01:55:40,610
You're going to put fighters and unsafe
positions where they're going to get in

3983
01:55:40,611 --> 01:55:41,444
and not be,

3984
01:55:41,530 --> 01:55:42,020
um,

3985
01:55:42,020 --> 01:55:42,853
rehydrated.

3986
01:55:43,410 --> 01:55:46,410
So we took a look at
that and spoke with you,

3987
01:55:46,411 --> 01:55:46,831
saw it,

3988
01:55:46,831 --> 01:55:47,370
and he said,

3989
01:55:47,370 --> 01:55:47,730
hey,

3990
01:55:47,730 --> 01:55:48,031
you know,

3991
01:55:48,031 --> 01:55:48,990
maybe we should,

3992
01:55:49,230 --> 01:55:49,471
you know,

3993
01:55:49,471 --> 01:55:51,430
slowly rolled out the ivy band.

3994
01:55:51,431 --> 01:55:53,460
So we actually delayed
that by three months.

3995
01:55:53,461 --> 01:55:58,140
The program went into effect July
1st and we instituted the IB band,

3996
01:55:58,290 --> 01:55:58,890
um,

3997
01:55:58,890 --> 01:55:59,730
October 1st.

3998
01:55:59,731 --> 01:56:03,180
So we had three months of
getting fighters prepared for it,

3999
01:56:03,210 --> 01:56:04,470
educating them why,

4000
01:56:04,830 --> 01:56:05,191
um,

4001
01:56:05,191 --> 01:56:06,024
that they were banned.

4002
01:56:06,420 --> 01:56:07,320
Nevertheless,

4003
01:56:07,380 --> 01:56:08,213
I mean,

4004
01:56:08,310 --> 01:56:12,300
real quickly the whole weight cutting
issue came kind of into my plate.

4005
01:56:12,360 --> 01:56:13,000
And while,

4006
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:13,250
you know,

4007
01:56:13,250 --> 01:56:14,790
I wasn't an expert in it,

4008
01:56:14,820 --> 01:56:17,100
I had to get out and talk
to a lot of fighters,

4009
01:56:17,101 --> 01:56:17,491
camps,

4010
01:56:17,491 --> 01:56:20,190
coaches about ivs and give them,

4011
01:56:20,220 --> 01:56:20,431
you know,

4012
01:56:20,431 --> 01:56:23,130
alternatives to rehydrating the right way.

4013
01:56:23,131 --> 01:56:24,780
And so I,

4014
01:56:24,781 --> 01:56:25,201
again,

4015
01:56:25,201 --> 01:56:26,370
not being an expert myself,

4016
01:56:26,371 --> 01:56:29,580
I reached out to what I found
were we're experts in the world.

4017
01:56:29,580 --> 01:56:34,230
A certain guy by name of Doctor Robert
[inaudible] who is a phd exercise

4018
01:56:34,231 --> 01:56:35,160
physiologist,

4019
01:56:35,610 --> 01:56:40,380
works with the US Army Research Institute
of Environmental Medicine Studies,

4020
01:56:40,381 --> 01:56:42,360
environmental effects on soldiers,

4021
01:56:42,510 --> 01:56:44,580
his expertise being dehydration.

4022
01:56:44,581 --> 01:56:48,240
So soldiers in the Middle East
that are marching for hours,

4023
01:56:48,241 --> 01:56:50,640
days upon a time run out of water,

4024
01:56:51,150 --> 01:56:52,380
dehydrate themselves.

4025
01:56:52,381 --> 01:56:54,060
How do we get these fighters back?

4026
01:56:54,180 --> 01:56:57,870
Are these soldiers back rehydrated
and back into the fight and thought,

4027
01:56:57,871 --> 01:56:58,021
hey,

4028
01:56:58,021 --> 01:57:00,120
this is the type of expert
that we need to talk to.

4029
01:57:00,121 --> 01:57:01,590
Its extreme dehydration.

4030
01:57:01,591 --> 01:57:01,890
Not,

4031
01:57:01,890 --> 01:57:02,723
you know,

4032
01:57:02,760 --> 01:57:04,050
some kid that has diarrhea,

4033
01:57:04,060 --> 01:57:05,750
it's mildly dehydrated with some,

4034
01:57:05,751 --> 01:57:06,584
some pedialyte.

4035
01:57:07,290 --> 01:57:08,430
So we brought him in.

4036
01:57:08,930 --> 01:57:09,390
Um,

4037
01:57:09,390 --> 01:57:11,850
had him actually the week of UFC 200,

4038
01:57:11,940 --> 01:57:12,360
um,

4039
01:57:12,360 --> 01:57:13,290
he was in town,

4040
01:57:13,350 --> 01:57:14,940
got a chance to talk to a lot of the,

4041
01:57:15,300 --> 01:57:18,940
the fighters coming in and analyze
the message they were using.

4042
01:57:19,350 --> 01:57:19,720
Um,

4043
01:57:19,720 --> 01:57:21,150
he recommended to us,

4044
01:57:21,180 --> 01:57:21,690
hey,

4045
01:57:21,690 --> 01:57:22,111
you know,

4046
01:57:22,111 --> 01:57:24,570
here's the maximum amount
of weight fighters,

4047
01:57:24,600 --> 01:57:24,870
you know,

4048
01:57:24,870 --> 01:57:26,160
that you should recommend.

4049
01:57:26,160 --> 01:57:27,750
Fighters are losing that fight week.

4050
01:57:27,751 --> 01:57:31,110
And that's how we came up with
our weight guideline of 8%.

4051
01:57:31,111 --> 01:57:36,030
So we recommend when those fighters
checkin Tuesday for a Saturday fight there

4052
01:57:36,031 --> 01:57:37,800
within 8% of their goal weight,

4053
01:57:37,890 --> 01:57:39,030
usually on Friday.

4054
01:57:39,540 --> 01:57:41,910
I'm not a requirement or recommendation,

4055
01:57:41,911 --> 01:57:42,451
but you know,

4056
01:57:42,451 --> 01:57:45,000
we put that out there and
educated heavily on that.

4057
01:57:45,570 --> 01:57:46,260
Um,

4058
01:57:46,260 --> 01:57:47,071
since then,

4059
01:57:47,071 --> 01:57:47,370
uh,

4060
01:57:47,370 --> 01:57:47,821
you talked,

4061
01:57:47,821 --> 01:57:49,410
I think last week about Andy Foster,

4062
01:57:49,411 --> 01:57:52,650
the executive director of California
who's really taken the lead in terms of

4063
01:57:52,651 --> 01:57:55,560
commissions on combating
dangerous weight cutting.

4064
01:57:56,080 --> 01:57:56,610
Um,

4065
01:57:56,610 --> 01:57:59,700
he worked with US pretty closely
on developing his 10 point,

4066
01:57:59,920 --> 01:58:00,330
um,

4067
01:58:00,330 --> 01:58:04,110
weight cutting plan or plan to
combat serious weight cutting.

4068
01:58:04,530 --> 01:58:05,041
Um,

4069
01:58:05,041 --> 01:58:09,780
includes his commission making calls
to fighters on the car 30 days out,

4070
01:58:09,870 --> 01:58:10,650
10 days out,

4071
01:58:10,650 --> 01:58:12,750
making them a little bit more accountable,

4072
01:58:13,270 --> 01:58:13,520
uh,

4073
01:58:13,520 --> 01:58:14,820
farther out than fight week.

4074
01:58:15,330 --> 01:58:15,661
Um,

4075
01:58:15,661 --> 01:58:18,210
he's also got a provision
where fight night,

4076
01:58:18,300 --> 01:58:19,470
he takes the fighters weight,

4077
01:58:19,800 --> 01:58:24,630
weighs them and their recommendation is
you only put on 10% of your weight back

4078
01:58:24,631 --> 01:58:25,860
on plus a pound.

4079
01:58:26,370 --> 01:58:27,030
Um,

4080
01:58:27,030 --> 01:58:30,720
if they're over that California can
recommend the fight or move up away class.

4081
01:58:31,260 --> 01:58:31,950
Um,

4082
01:58:31,950 --> 01:58:32,491
so really,

4083
01:58:32,491 --> 01:58:32,731
yeah,

4084
01:58:32,731 --> 01:58:33,780
I mean just a lot of,

4085
01:58:33,810 --> 01:58:34,051
you know,

4086
01:58:34,051 --> 01:58:35,910
education recommendations not here.

4087
01:58:35,911 --> 01:58:37,020
A lot of people talk about,

4088
01:58:37,021 --> 01:58:39,360
and I'm curious for your thoughts on this.

4089
01:58:40,020 --> 01:58:40,530
Hey we can,

4090
01:58:40,530 --> 01:58:44,350
we can stop instantaneous issue and
instantaneously just put rules out there.

4091
01:58:44,440 --> 01:58:47,560
If you lose this much weight or
put this much weight back on,

4092
01:58:47,561 --> 01:58:49,150
you're suspended for six months,

4093
01:58:49,151 --> 01:58:50,020
12 months,

4094
01:58:50,230 --> 01:58:50,441
you know,

4095
01:58:50,441 --> 01:58:50,920
whatever your,

4096
01:58:50,920 --> 01:58:51,930
we're just not going to let you,

4097
01:58:52,020 --> 01:58:52,853
you fight.

4098
01:58:53,230 --> 01:58:56,290
My concern there is when
you have absolute rules,

4099
01:58:56,920 --> 01:59:00,820
fighter's going to do
everything possible to you know,

4100
01:59:00,821 --> 01:59:01,451
to make weight.

4101
01:59:01,451 --> 01:59:02,710
Say you had a rule that if you miss,

4102
01:59:02,711 --> 01:59:03,011
wait,

4103
01:59:03,011 --> 01:59:04,570
you can't fight it again for 12 months,

4104
01:59:04,571 --> 01:59:08,470
you have to move up a weight class
fighter's going to kill themselves to make

4105
01:59:08,471 --> 01:59:08,681
weight.

4106
01:59:08,681 --> 01:59:09,730
My fear would be that you,

4107
01:59:09,790 --> 01:59:13,780
you put an absolute rule out there and
someone get hurts because of the rule

4108
01:59:13,781 --> 01:59:14,860
that you put in place,

4109
01:59:15,400 --> 01:59:16,180
which is a,

4110
01:59:16,180 --> 01:59:16,361
you know,

4111
01:59:16,361 --> 01:59:17,530
I think it's a measured approach.

4112
01:59:17,530 --> 01:59:19,420
You have to continually reevaluate it.

4113
01:59:19,421 --> 01:59:23,380
But I think right now the rules that are
out there between our recommendations,

4114
01:59:23,381 --> 01:59:26,980
California has rules are more
guideline recommendations.

4115
01:59:26,981 --> 01:59:31,270
And then that in conjunction with what
we're doing at the performance institute

4116
01:59:31,271 --> 01:59:32,020
where,

4117
01:59:32,020 --> 01:59:33,190
I mean you saw last week,

4118
01:59:33,430 --> 01:59:38,260
there is no excuse if you have issues
making weight or you're not sure what your

4119
01:59:38,261 --> 01:59:38,981
weight class is,

4120
01:59:38,981 --> 01:59:43,960
that you have every resource available
the best in the world to you to come in

4121
01:59:43,961 --> 01:59:45,010
and find that out,

4122
01:59:45,011 --> 01:59:48,070
to be given a plan on how
to safely then make weight.

4123
01:59:48,670 --> 01:59:49,181
Um,

4124
01:59:49,181 --> 01:59:49,630
so,

4125
01:59:49,630 --> 01:59:49,841
you know,

4126
01:59:49,841 --> 01:59:49,981
it's,

4127
01:59:49,981 --> 01:59:50,271
it's,

4128
01:59:50,271 --> 01:59:54,580
it's a multimillion dollar investment
that the UFC has put I think toward that

4129
01:59:54,581 --> 01:59:55,810
problem and you know,

4130
01:59:55,811 --> 01:59:55,961
hey,

4131
01:59:55,961 --> 01:59:56,681
maybe two,

4132
01:59:56,681 --> 01:59:57,880
three years from now we say,

4133
01:59:58,390 --> 01:59:58,491
hey,

4134
01:59:58,491 --> 01:59:59,680
that was with good intentions,

4135
01:59:59,681 --> 02:00:00,700
but not enough.

4136
02:00:00,730 --> 02:00:01,630
We need to do more.

4137
02:00:01,631 --> 02:00:02,800
But I think right now,

4138
02:00:03,130 --> 02:00:03,670
um,

4139
02:00:03,670 --> 02:00:04,750
that's our strategy,

4140
02:00:04,840 --> 02:00:05,081
uh,

4141
02:00:05,081 --> 02:00:05,914
on the issue.

4142
02:00:06,140 --> 02:00:06,381
Well,

4143
02:00:06,381 --> 02:00:10,190
I think a couple things would have to
happen to really stop weight cutting.

4144
02:00:10,280 --> 02:00:12,740
One thing you're going to have to blow
up these weight classes because there's

4145
02:00:12,741 --> 02:00:15,710
going to be champions in these weight
classes that really won't be in that

4146
02:00:15,711 --> 02:00:16,730
weight class anymore.

4147
02:00:16,910 --> 02:00:21,910
If you cut all the real heavy duty
weight cutting out of the picture.

4148
02:00:22,580 --> 02:00:25,950
I think what one FC is
trying to do is they're,

4149
02:00:25,951 --> 02:00:28,640
they're doing hydration test
and they do a series of them.

4150
02:00:28,641 --> 02:00:30,590
I believe they do three
leading up to the fight,

4151
02:00:30,591 --> 02:00:32,330
which really was it.

4152
02:00:32,331 --> 02:00:33,680
Benevidez was telling me this,

4153
02:00:34,190 --> 02:00:34,610
someone,

4154
02:00:34,610 --> 02:00:35,480
someone was telling me this,

4155
02:00:35,900 --> 02:00:39,950
that they've essentially made it almost
impossible for you to cut weight.

4156
02:00:40,550 --> 02:00:44,990
So they do hydration test on weighing
at the way they're doing hydration test

4157
02:00:45,140 --> 02:00:46,220
three different times,

4158
02:00:46,430 --> 02:00:47,990
three different times
leading up to the fight.

4159
02:00:48,020 --> 02:00:49,460
I don't know the exact protocol,

4160
02:00:49,461 --> 02:00:52,520
but what they've done is essentially
made it so that you can't be dehydrated.

4161
02:00:52,820 --> 02:00:53,331
Like you can't,

4162
02:00:53,331 --> 02:00:54,051
when you weigh in,

4163
02:00:54,051 --> 02:00:55,350
you have to weigh in and as you know,

4164
02:00:55,370 --> 02:00:58,800
like if you're fighting at
one 70 but you know you,

4165
02:00:58,801 --> 02:01:00,800
you get on the scale and
you're fucking dying,

4166
02:01:01,170 --> 02:01:01,520
they're like,

4167
02:01:01,520 --> 02:01:01,701
no,

4168
02:01:01,701 --> 02:01:03,040
you're not really one 70 like,

4169
02:01:03,050 --> 02:01:03,883
and that,

4170
02:01:03,950 --> 02:01:05,720
that's really where it should be.

4171
02:01:05,930 --> 02:01:10,930
This idea that the best way to fight is
to cheat and to drain all yourself of

4172
02:01:11,121 --> 02:01:14,060
fluids and then pretend
that you're 160 pounds,

4173
02:01:14,061 --> 02:01:15,440
then get back on the scale,

4174
02:01:15,890 --> 02:01:16,723
you know,

4175
02:01:16,850 --> 02:01:21,050
15 hours later at one
85 that's fucking crazy.

4176
02:01:21,051 --> 02:01:22,190
That doesn't make any sense.

4177
02:01:22,970 --> 02:01:25,010
You're not really 160 pound fighter.

4178
02:01:25,011 --> 02:01:27,890
You're 185 pound fighter who almost died.

4179
02:01:28,190 --> 02:01:28,880
Yeah,

4180
02:01:28,880 --> 02:01:29,481
it's interesting,

4181
02:01:29,481 --> 02:01:29,661
you know,

4182
02:01:29,661 --> 02:01:32,850
if I talk with forest a lot about this
because he went through it and again why

4183
02:01:32,851 --> 02:01:36,650
he's such a great asset to
the probe to the company,

4184
02:01:37,070 --> 02:01:37,250
uh,

4185
02:01:37,250 --> 02:01:37,731
but he says,

4186
02:01:37,731 --> 02:01:38,090
look,

4187
02:01:38,090 --> 02:01:41,690
there's certain and girls
that have a genetic,

4188
02:01:42,040 --> 02:01:42,530
um,

4189
02:01:42,530 --> 02:01:43,880
ability to,

4190
02:01:44,060 --> 02:01:44,780
to carry,

4191
02:01:44,780 --> 02:01:44,961
you know,

4192
02:01:44,961 --> 02:01:46,190
they have good muscle mass.

4193
02:01:46,190 --> 02:01:48,590
Usually that just carry a
ton of water and it's not,

4194
02:01:49,070 --> 02:01:50,150
it's not difficult.

4195
02:01:50,151 --> 02:01:53,650
It's not dangerous for them to
drop 10 or 15 pounds and not,

4196
02:01:53,690 --> 02:01:57,230
but it would be if they
fought 15 pounds under c,

4197
02:01:57,360 --> 02:02:00,080
if they're a fighting at 170 pounds,

4198
02:02:00,081 --> 02:02:04,160
they really weigh one 85 and if they
cut down to one 70 they make that weight

4199
02:02:04,161 --> 02:02:05,510
and then fought right then.

4200
02:02:05,720 --> 02:02:06,770
Then it would be dangerous.

4201
02:02:06,771 --> 02:02:08,450
Their performance would
be radically diminished.

4202
02:02:08,540 --> 02:02:09,410
So we're lying.

4203
02:02:09,411 --> 02:02:10,670
When those people get on the scale,

4204
02:02:10,790 --> 02:02:14,960
when they get on the scale and they flex
and they say one 70 sure you're one 70

4205
02:02:14,961 --> 02:02:16,010
for about an hour,

4206
02:02:16,310 --> 02:02:16,731
you know,

4207
02:02:16,731 --> 02:02:19,880
and then you're going to go right back
up to what you were before you dehydrated

4208
02:02:19,881 --> 02:02:20,331
yourself.

4209
02:02:20,331 --> 02:02:21,920
This is madness to me.

4210
02:02:22,150 --> 02:02:25,460
Well this goes against what
fighting is supposed to be.

4211
02:02:25,461 --> 02:02:29,540
What we talked about before
about discipline and focus
and and and technique and

4212
02:02:29,541 --> 02:02:30,320
training.

4213
02:02:30,320 --> 02:02:32,630
That's what competing
is supposed to be about.

4214
02:02:32,631 --> 02:02:37,631
It's supposed to be about a fight or
two equally skillful individuals try to

4215
02:02:37,761 --> 02:02:40,580
figure out who's got the best strategy
and who's got the best we'll and

4216
02:02:40,760 --> 02:02:41,593
technique.

4217
02:02:41,870 --> 02:02:46,730
It's not supposed to be about who can
do this legal cheating thing best cause.

4218
02:02:46,731 --> 02:02:48,440
That's what weight cutting is.

4219
02:02:48,540 --> 02:02:49,100
Well you know,

4220
02:02:49,100 --> 02:02:52,640
really the modern history of the UFC and
the reason I think it's so successful

4221
02:02:52,641 --> 02:02:55,250
is the Renzo and Dana
ran toward regulation,

4222
02:02:55,280 --> 02:02:55,640
right?

4223
02:02:55,640 --> 02:02:56,120
Yes.

4224
02:02:56,120 --> 02:02:56,631
They said,

4225
02:02:56,631 --> 02:02:56,811
hey,

4226
02:02:56,811 --> 02:02:57,920
this is a no,

4227
02:02:57,980 --> 02:02:58,191
you know,

4228
02:02:58,191 --> 02:02:59,840
marketed as an no rules,

4229
02:02:59,841 --> 02:03:01,040
no hold bar event.

4230
02:03:01,160 --> 02:03:02,390
They ran toward rules.

4231
02:03:02,900 --> 02:03:04,530
And so I think you know
what you're taught.

4232
02:03:04,531 --> 02:03:07,640
And I actually had a discussion with Bob
Bennett about this executive director

4233
02:03:07,641 --> 02:03:08,210
of Nevada.

4234
02:03:08,210 --> 02:03:10,740
He's Graham last week and you know,

4235
02:03:10,760 --> 02:03:12,380
he's looking what
California is doing says,

4236
02:03:12,381 --> 02:03:13,214
look,

4237
02:03:13,310 --> 02:03:16,370
we have physicals after the way in.

4238
02:03:16,430 --> 02:03:17,181
So you know,

4239
02:03:17,181 --> 02:03:18,860
we do the way it is now at the host hotel.

4240
02:03:18,890 --> 02:03:21,390
So it's usually done
at a ballroom fighter,

4241
02:03:21,410 --> 02:03:22,430
gets up on the scale,

4242
02:03:22,460 --> 02:03:23,630
makes weight immediately,

4243
02:03:23,631 --> 02:03:26,180
goes behind the curtain and
has their pre-fight physical.

4244
02:03:26,300 --> 02:03:26,491
Right.

4245
02:03:26,491 --> 02:03:27,890
But do they have a hydration test?

4246
02:03:28,630 --> 02:03:28,970
I,

4247
02:03:28,970 --> 02:03:29,511
they don't.

4248
02:03:29,511 --> 02:03:32,180
I know California does some
hydration testing fight night,

4249
02:03:32,181 --> 02:03:32,421
but would,

4250
02:03:32,421 --> 02:03:34,410
Bob told me as I have the most experience,

4251
02:03:34,411 --> 02:03:39,140
ringside physicians in the world that
have seen more combat sports events and

4252
02:03:39,141 --> 02:03:39,441
everywhere,

4253
02:03:39,441 --> 02:03:44,060
I'm comfortable that these guys are
evaluating these medical professionals or

4254
02:03:44,061 --> 02:03:48,330
evaluating these fighters in the scenario
and if they feel or see something's

4255
02:03:48,360 --> 02:03:50,510
not safe for that fighter
to compete the next night,

4256
02:03:50,511 --> 02:03:51,440
that they'll call them off.

4257
02:03:51,500 --> 02:03:52,430
I think that's wonderful.

4258
02:03:52,431 --> 02:03:56,390
But I think all that does is keep fighters
from getting to the point of death.

4259
02:03:56,900 --> 02:03:57,170
I mean,

4260
02:03:57,170 --> 02:03:58,680
getting to the point where
they're sick and tear,

4261
02:03:58,730 --> 02:04:01,070
they're definitely compromised
when they're making the weight.

4262
02:04:01,070 --> 02:04:02,330
They're not really at that weight.

4263
02:04:02,660 --> 02:04:03,680
What I would really love,

4264
02:04:03,681 --> 02:04:04,580
in a perfect world,

4265
02:04:04,581 --> 02:04:05,870
besides the bare knuckle thing,

4266
02:04:06,140 --> 02:04:09,320
what I would really love is a
weight class every 10 pounds.

4267
02:04:09,650 --> 02:04:10,461
Just have every time.

4268
02:04:10,461 --> 02:04:10,641
I mean,

4269
02:04:10,641 --> 02:04:11,990
there's just giant gaps.

4270
02:04:12,200 --> 02:04:15,620
The gap between 85 and two
oh five is 20 fucking pounds.

4271
02:04:15,621 --> 02:04:16,880
That's a lot of weight.

4272
02:04:17,480 --> 02:04:18,260
I hear that.

4273
02:04:18,260 --> 02:04:23,260
But let me give you a scenario where it
shows that alone and can work female new

4274
02:04:24,680 --> 02:04:27,620
division for the UFC one 25 right?

4275
02:04:27,680 --> 02:04:30,290
Because we had a one
15 to one 35 pound gap,

4276
02:04:30,320 --> 02:04:30,830
right?

4277
02:04:30,830 --> 02:04:32,840
What happened in our
first championship fight?

4278
02:04:34,240 --> 02:04:36,590
So Jara Eubanks couldn't make weight.

4279
02:04:37,350 --> 02:04:37,711
She didn't,

4280
02:04:37,711 --> 02:04:37,980
she

4281
02:04:37,980 --> 02:04:38,450
wasn't even,

4282
02:04:38,450 --> 02:04:38,641
you know,

4283
02:04:38,641 --> 02:04:39,474
so there,

4284
02:04:39,810 --> 02:04:40,890
that in and of itself,

4285
02:04:40,891 --> 02:04:42,090
just making a weight class,

4286
02:04:42,091 --> 02:04:43,320
I don't think solves the problem.

4287
02:04:43,710 --> 02:04:47,850
But she's also relatively
inexperienced young to sport.

4288
02:04:47,940 --> 02:04:50,670
And this is a brand new way class
that they really didn't have a,

4289
02:04:50,910 --> 02:04:52,590
I'm not saying he had more weight classes,

4290
02:04:52,591 --> 02:04:53,280
wouldn't help,

4291
02:04:53,280 --> 02:04:54,780
but they're not going
to help by themselves.

4292
02:04:54,781 --> 02:04:57,360
You gotta it's gotta be
a multiple prong attack.

4293
02:04:57,420 --> 02:05:00,180
I think the hydration test
should be along with that,

4294
02:05:00,270 --> 02:05:05,070
the hydration test and weight classes
every 10 pounds and then give the champion

4295
02:05:05,071 --> 02:05:05,881
the benefit of the doubt.

4296
02:05:05,881 --> 02:05:06,990
Like whoever is the champion,

4297
02:05:06,991 --> 02:05:07,650
each division,

4298
02:05:07,650 --> 02:05:07,980
whatever,

4299
02:05:07,980 --> 02:05:09,480
whatever weight class,

4300
02:05:10,320 --> 02:05:15,120
you know what we find out what they
really way and they have an opportunity to

4301
02:05:15,121 --> 02:05:16,830
fight for the title in that weight class.

4302
02:05:17,310 --> 02:05:17,611
You have to,

4303
02:05:17,611 --> 02:05:20,100
I think we talked about it
when you tour through the Pie,

4304
02:05:20,101 --> 02:05:25,101
but we have on a couple of occasion use
that bioelectrical impedance machine to

4305
02:05:25,141 --> 02:05:26,820
determine is that the proper term?

4306
02:05:27,030 --> 02:05:27,750
I don't know.

4307
02:05:27,750 --> 02:05:28,200
Um,

4308
02:05:28,200 --> 02:05:31,020
but it basically can you
step on the scale and you,

4309
02:05:31,290 --> 02:05:35,430
you hold onto these handles and it gives
you some type of hydration reading.

4310
02:05:35,460 --> 02:05:36,150
Um,

4311
02:05:36,150 --> 02:05:38,790
we've done that a few
times on checking day,

4312
02:05:39,300 --> 02:05:39,961
weigh in day.

4313
02:05:39,961 --> 02:05:42,150
We're not sure exactly
what the numbers look like,

4314
02:05:42,151 --> 02:05:43,170
but that's something that,

4315
02:05:43,220 --> 02:05:43,470
you know,

4316
02:05:43,470 --> 02:05:44,310
we're looking into.

4317
02:05:44,580 --> 02:05:47,070
Clint also does a lot of
specific gravity testing,

4318
02:05:47,160 --> 02:05:49,350
fight week on fighters where,

4319
02:05:49,440 --> 02:05:49,730
you know,

4320
02:05:49,730 --> 02:05:52,950
it'll be a Tuesday or Wednesday and
I think he showed you that chart.

4321
02:05:53,420 --> 02:05:53,880
Um,

4322
02:05:53,880 --> 02:05:57,540
he'll look at how much weight fighter
has to lose and then look at what their

4323
02:05:57,541 --> 02:05:58,920
specific gravity reading is,

4324
02:05:58,921 --> 02:06:01,080
how diluted or concentrated the urine is.

4325
02:06:01,470 --> 02:06:02,041
And you know,

4326
02:06:02,041 --> 02:06:05,130
if you see someone with a bunch
of weight to lose that is,

4327
02:06:05,131 --> 02:06:05,371
you know,

4328
02:06:05,371 --> 02:06:07,920
relatively dehydrated
specific gravity wise,

4329
02:06:07,921 --> 02:06:08,731
then you know,

4330
02:06:08,731 --> 02:06:09,850
it can alter their plan.

4331
02:06:09,851 --> 02:06:11,160
So yeah,

4332
02:06:11,161 --> 02:06:12,120
I mean we've got a lot of,

4333
02:06:12,210 --> 02:06:13,620
a lot of that stuff going on.

4334
02:06:13,620 --> 02:06:17,550
I don't necessarily disagree with
you that that more needs to be done,

4335
02:06:17,551 --> 02:06:20,730
but right now our plan of attack
is to use these resources,

4336
02:06:20,731 --> 02:06:22,470
use the facility of the pie.

4337
02:06:22,860 --> 02:06:23,071
You know,

4338
02:06:23,071 --> 02:06:24,210
in an ideal world,

4339
02:06:24,510 --> 02:06:27,150
I think rather than making
these absolute rules,

4340
02:06:27,360 --> 02:06:29,100
trying to educate our fighters,

4341
02:06:29,130 --> 02:06:29,970
trying to show them,

4342
02:06:29,971 --> 02:06:30,804
I tell you one thing,

4343
02:06:31,110 --> 02:06:35,010
you can talk until you're blue in
the face about things being bad,

4344
02:06:35,370 --> 02:06:37,110
unhealthy for a fighter.

4345
02:06:37,290 --> 02:06:38,123
They're like,

4346
02:06:38,570 --> 02:06:39,450
I'm bullet proof.

4347
02:06:39,480 --> 02:06:40,021
Not only that,

4348
02:06:40,021 --> 02:06:40,854
they're fighters,

4349
02:06:41,330 --> 02:06:42,060
they're fighting.

4350
02:06:42,060 --> 02:06:43,140
That's bad for you anyway.

4351
02:06:43,170 --> 02:06:43,680
Right?

4352
02:06:43,680 --> 02:06:43,891
Like,

4353
02:06:43,891 --> 02:06:44,131
oh,

4354
02:06:44,131 --> 02:06:45,450
cut and weights bad for me too.

4355
02:06:45,480 --> 02:06:45,930
Okay.

4356
02:06:45,930 --> 02:06:46,980
Where they start listening.

4357
02:06:46,981 --> 02:06:49,620
And I think this is where the performance
institute comes into play when you

4358
02:06:49,621 --> 02:06:51,900
start talking about the
effect on your performance.

4359
02:06:52,460 --> 02:06:52,800
Um,

4360
02:06:52,800 --> 02:06:54,090
so if you tell them,

4361
02:06:54,180 --> 02:06:55,013
hey look,

4362
02:06:55,110 --> 02:06:57,690
if you can come to you know,

4363
02:06:57,691 --> 02:07:02,691
your proper weight in a more measured
approach and not lose a whole bunch and

4364
02:07:02,701 --> 02:07:03,780
put that what look,

4365
02:07:03,810 --> 02:07:08,700
look at the difference it's going to
make on your performance 24 to 30 hours

4366
02:07:08,701 --> 02:07:09,600
later because you see this,

4367
02:07:09,601 --> 02:07:11,880
I mean you see this occasionally
when fighters go through,

4368
02:07:11,900 --> 02:07:12,150
you know,

4369
02:07:12,150 --> 02:07:12,900
tough weight cuts.

4370
02:07:12,900 --> 02:07:13,733
You see them,

4371
02:07:13,810 --> 02:07:15,450
Sandra says after a round or two,

4372
02:07:15,510 --> 02:07:15,780
right?

4373
02:07:15,780 --> 02:07:16,171
Oh good.

4374
02:07:16,171 --> 02:07:18,020
He's looked moving up to 170 pounds.

4375
02:07:18,021 --> 02:07:19,140
I mean it's just phenomenal.

4376
02:07:19,560 --> 02:07:20,910
I also think now it's interesting,

4377
02:07:20,960 --> 02:07:21,380
there's,

4378
02:07:21,380 --> 02:07:21,600
you know,

4379
02:07:21,600 --> 02:07:23,250
on one side of it the criticism would be,

4380
02:07:23,251 --> 02:07:26,790
well you're just encouraging even
greater weight cuts and regains.

4381
02:07:26,791 --> 02:07:29,700
But I think this morning
weigh in thing that we've,

4382
02:07:29,790 --> 02:07:33,930
we've put together I think has had a
positive impact in a couple of areas.

4383
02:07:34,550 --> 02:07:36,220
Explain that for people to
know what we're talking about.

4384
02:07:36,380 --> 02:07:38,020
So actually Andy Foster again,

4385
02:07:38,021 --> 02:07:41,920
California before UFC one
99 came to me and said,

4386
02:07:41,921 --> 02:07:42,041
hey,

4387
02:07:42,041 --> 02:07:46,270
we've been doing this morning weigh
in for a couple regional local shows.

4388
02:07:46,300 --> 02:07:47,710
Would you guys be interested in it?

4389
02:07:47,711 --> 02:07:49,540
Where we do it at the host hotel,

4390
02:07:50,260 --> 02:07:50,890
we do it,

4391
02:07:50,890 --> 02:07:51,040
you know,

4392
02:07:51,040 --> 02:07:56,040
we'd open the scales from 9:00 AM to
11:00 AM and the idea would be a fighter

4393
02:07:56,321 --> 02:07:57,820
gets on weight in their hotel room,

4394
02:07:57,821 --> 02:08:01,300
upstairs hops on the
elevator steps on the scale.

4395
02:08:01,480 --> 02:08:02,170
They make weight,

4396
02:08:02,170 --> 02:08:06,040
they can start eating and drinking again
right away with the idea of they don't

4397
02:08:06,041 --> 02:08:08,620
have to wait til 4:00 PM and extra
know exactly what the idea of,

4398
02:08:08,621 --> 02:08:10,870
I think one of the dangers of,

4399
02:08:10,920 --> 02:08:11,230
you know,

4400
02:08:11,230 --> 02:08:14,950
weight cutting and being dehydrated is
the amount of time that you're at a,

4401
02:08:15,040 --> 02:08:15,280
you know,

4402
02:08:15,280 --> 02:08:16,600
add a loss of that water.

4403
02:08:16,990 --> 02:08:19,990
And in the past when we'd have
the weigh ins at an arena,

4404
02:08:21,070 --> 02:08:21,521
it would be,

4405
02:08:21,521 --> 02:08:23,290
the fight would have
to check in downstairs.

4406
02:08:23,291 --> 02:08:23,650
Say the,

4407
02:08:23,650 --> 02:08:25,540
we had the way ends at
four o'clock in an arena,

4408
02:08:26,020 --> 02:08:26,710
the firewood,

4409
02:08:26,710 --> 02:08:29,030
the fighter would check in
downstairs that maybe two,

4410
02:08:29,570 --> 02:08:30,403
um,

4411
02:08:30,670 --> 02:08:32,260
two 30 the bus would leave.

4412
02:08:32,650 --> 02:08:36,040
I remember in Rio were in one
time on a bus for an hour,

4413
02:08:36,040 --> 02:08:36,581
hour and a half to the arena.

4414
02:08:36,581 --> 02:08:40,720
Everybody's depleted and dehydrated on
the bus ride you step on a scale and a

4415
02:08:40,721 --> 02:08:41,554
cold,

4416
02:08:41,620 --> 02:08:42,453
you know,

4417
02:08:42,730 --> 02:08:44,770
environmentally unfriendly arena.

4418
02:08:45,250 --> 02:08:48,130
You then get back on the
bus drive another hour,

4419
02:08:48,130 --> 02:08:48,131
hour and a half.

4420
02:08:48,131 --> 02:08:51,910
You're talking multiple hours where
these fighters are in a depleted state.

4421
02:08:52,360 --> 02:08:54,700
So I think the morning way
and protects against that.

4422
02:08:54,701 --> 02:08:56,880
I think the other benefit
we've seen out of it,

4423
02:08:56,930 --> 02:09:00,220
I think it's more of a longterm than a
short term benefit is we've seen a lot

4424
02:09:00,221 --> 02:09:03,640
more fighters missing weight since
we went to the morning weigh ins.

4425
02:09:03,970 --> 02:09:06,580
And I think that's a product of timing.

4426
02:09:06,940 --> 02:09:08,860
And that in the past you had four,

4427
02:09:08,890 --> 02:09:09,130
you know,

4428
02:09:09,130 --> 02:09:10,210
four or five in the afternoon,

4429
02:09:10,211 --> 02:09:14,450
you had all day long to cut weight and
you would see fighters at 10 or 11 said,

4430
02:09:14,540 --> 02:09:15,420
I can't do anymore.

4431
02:09:16,010 --> 02:09:17,260
And a one or two o'clock I said,

4432
02:09:17,261 --> 02:09:17,351
no,

4433
02:09:17,351 --> 02:09:20,020
I can do a couple more pounds
and just all day long now,

4434
02:09:20,260 --> 02:09:22,570
unless you're literally not
sleeping the night before you fight,

4435
02:09:22,870 --> 02:09:25,570
you have a shorter window
in the morning to do that.

4436
02:09:25,570 --> 02:09:26,830
And I think a lot of those myths,

4437
02:09:26,831 --> 02:09:30,220
weights has helped identify those
fighters that I'm probably on the right,

4438
02:09:30,300 --> 02:09:31,170
the wrong weight class.

4439
02:09:31,220 --> 02:09:33,520
I can't make that weight of waking up,

4440
02:09:33,580 --> 02:09:33,881
you know,

4441
02:09:33,881 --> 02:09:34,870
five or six in the morning,

4442
02:09:34,880 --> 02:09:35,651
a couple hours,

4443
02:09:35,651 --> 02:09:37,180
and it's probably too much weight to lose.

4444
02:09:37,181 --> 02:09:40,180
And we've seen some fighters move
up in weight class because of that.

4445
02:09:40,750 --> 02:09:42,970
We've also seen some
fighters that have decided,

4446
02:09:42,971 --> 02:09:43,211
hey,

4447
02:09:43,211 --> 02:09:46,540
I gotta take this more professionally
and hire a nutritionist.

4448
02:09:46,541 --> 02:09:47,200
Like could be,

4449
02:09:47,200 --> 02:09:51,160
it could be a number of Madoff who made
weight easily for his last fight and the

4450
02:09:51,161 --> 02:09:55,450
fight before that obviously fell out of
the fight because his body shut down and

4451
02:09:55,451 --> 02:09:56,290
he had to go to the hospital.

4452
02:09:56,291 --> 02:09:57,190
It'd be rehydrated.

4453
02:09:57,880 --> 02:09:58,151
Yeah,

4454
02:09:58,151 --> 02:09:58,811
I mean I again,

4455
02:09:58,811 --> 02:10:00,940
I don't think it's a one
size fits all solution.

4456
02:10:00,941 --> 02:10:01,840
You have to be careful,

4457
02:10:01,841 --> 02:10:02,260
hey,

4458
02:10:02,260 --> 02:10:04,720
it'd be missed weight that
last time went to the hospital.

4459
02:10:05,200 --> 02:10:05,461
You know,

4460
02:10:05,461 --> 02:10:06,860
a knee jerk reaction would be you,

4461
02:10:06,880 --> 02:10:08,760
you can't fight this weight anymore.

4462
02:10:08,800 --> 02:10:09,730
What we saw this time,

4463
02:10:09,731 --> 02:10:11,410
he just changed the way he did things.

4464
02:10:11,411 --> 02:10:11,951
He came in,

4465
02:10:11,951 --> 02:10:13,510
he was on wait the night before,

4466
02:10:13,511 --> 02:10:15,880
he had a couple of pounds
to lose fight week.

4467
02:10:16,270 --> 02:10:17,260
So it can be done.

4468
02:10:17,261 --> 02:10:17,621
And again,

4469
02:10:17,621 --> 02:10:19,700
that reverts back to the
performance institute.

4470
02:10:19,730 --> 02:10:24,430
I think there's no excuse now that if
you're a new fighter and you're not making

4471
02:10:24,431 --> 02:10:27,220
a hell of a lot of money and
don't have the resources to hire,

4472
02:10:27,490 --> 02:10:27,770
you know,

4473
02:10:27,770 --> 02:10:29,290
George Lockhart who ever,

4474
02:10:29,350 --> 02:10:29,591
you know,

4475
02:10:29,591 --> 02:10:34,160
have Clinton Wattenberg who's an ivy
league educated Sports Dietitian that can

4476
02:10:34,790 --> 02:10:36,200
provide you all that remotely.

4477
02:10:36,201 --> 02:10:37,250
If you can't get to Vegas,

4478
02:10:37,251 --> 02:10:38,900
he'll give you a full plan over,

4479
02:10:39,320 --> 02:10:39,591
you know,

4480
02:10:39,591 --> 02:10:40,371
over the phone,

4481
02:10:40,371 --> 02:10:41,600
over email.

4482
02:10:41,930 --> 02:10:42,260
Um,

4483
02:10:42,260 --> 02:10:43,460
if you can get to Vegas,

4484
02:10:43,490 --> 02:10:46,310
not only will Clint
plan things out for you,

4485
02:10:46,311 --> 02:10:51,050
but you have a kitchen and cooks and
staff that will provide you that meal

4486
02:10:51,320 --> 02:10:53,630
throughout your whole fight camp
that just want to be there for free.

4487
02:10:53,810 --> 02:10:54,643
So amazing.

4488
02:10:54,840 --> 02:10:55,910
The place is incredible.

4489
02:10:55,940 --> 02:10:58,710
And we will have a Clint and um,

4490
02:10:59,030 --> 02:10:59,570
Dunkin,

4491
02:10:59,570 --> 02:10:59,781
uh,

4492
02:10:59,781 --> 02:11:00,540
on the podcast.

4493
02:11:00,540 --> 02:11:01,310
Explain all that.

4494
02:11:01,310 --> 02:11:02,550
What's in that little silver?

4495
02:11:02,590 --> 02:11:02,930
Yeah.

4496
02:11:02,930 --> 02:11:03,321
So,

4497
02:11:03,321 --> 02:11:04,010
uh,

4498
02:11:04,010 --> 02:11:04,843
this is,

4499
02:11:04,910 --> 02:11:05,301
uh,

4500
02:11:05,301 --> 02:11:06,540
so one of the things that,

4501
02:11:06,560 --> 02:11:09,080
that we want to do with
this program again is,

4502
02:11:09,110 --> 02:11:09,650
you know,

4503
02:11:09,650 --> 02:11:10,670
first and foremost,

4504
02:11:10,671 --> 02:11:12,320
it's to protect the UFC athlete,

4505
02:11:12,321 --> 02:11:13,640
protect the rights of clean athletes,

4506
02:11:13,641 --> 02:11:18,641
but we also want to influence other
sports influenced anti-doping as a whole.

4507
02:11:19,071 --> 02:11:21,770
So you saw came to us
earlier this year and said,

4508
02:11:22,310 --> 02:11:23,660
we've got some new technology.

4509
02:11:23,980 --> 02:11:27,620
What do you guys think about using your
program to be the first to kind of roll

4510
02:11:27,621 --> 02:11:28,070
it out?

4511
02:11:28,070 --> 02:11:29,810
And so the answer was,

4512
02:11:29,811 --> 02:11:30,170
well,

4513
02:11:30,170 --> 02:11:31,070
is the science good?

4514
02:11:31,071 --> 02:11:31,821
Is it validated?

4515
02:11:31,821 --> 02:11:32,031
They said,

4516
02:11:32,031 --> 02:11:32,271
yeah,

4517
02:11:32,271 --> 02:11:33,104
it is.

4518
02:11:33,170 --> 02:11:34,003
Um,

4519
02:11:34,010 --> 02:11:35,000
I was actually at a,

4520
02:11:35,150 --> 02:11:40,150
at a conference mid summer back in New
York and sat on a panel with Major League

4521
02:11:41,780 --> 02:11:45,710
Baseball Pga tour and the UFC and a
bunch of anti-doping scientists there.

4522
02:11:45,710 --> 02:11:48,830
And they were talking about this
technology and the other leagues.

4523
02:11:48,831 --> 02:11:49,281
We're asked,

4524
02:11:49,281 --> 02:11:49,491
hey,

4525
02:11:49,491 --> 02:11:50,900
you guys gonna Institute that?

4526
02:11:50,901 --> 02:11:51,201
And they're like,

4527
02:11:51,201 --> 02:11:52,034
Nah.

4528
02:11:52,120 --> 02:11:52,860
Um,

4529
02:11:52,860 --> 02:11:53,240
you know,

4530
02:11:53,240 --> 02:11:53,510
I don't,

4531
02:11:53,510 --> 02:11:54,950
I don't think enough
stare and they went to me.

4532
02:11:54,951 --> 02:11:55,221
I'm like,

4533
02:11:55,221 --> 02:11:55,911
absolutely.

4534
02:11:55,911 --> 02:11:57,890
If you saw the science tells me this,

4535
02:11:58,040 --> 02:11:58,671
this works.

4536
02:11:58,671 --> 02:11:59,570
We want to be the first,

4537
02:11:59,571 --> 02:12:02,750
especially if it's more convenient
and more efficient for our program.

4538
02:12:03,200 --> 02:12:04,190
So what this is,

4539
02:12:04,191 --> 02:12:07,610
is it's a leaching device and um,

4540
02:12:07,850 --> 02:12:08,121
you know,

4541
02:12:08,121 --> 02:12:12,320
until this came out basically to
get any blood tests from a shit,

4542
02:12:12,321 --> 02:12:13,041
you got some scissors.

4543
02:12:13,041 --> 02:12:13,874
I,

4544
02:12:13,880 --> 02:12:14,713
yeah.

4545
02:12:14,930 --> 02:12:15,763
Nice.

4546
02:12:16,310 --> 02:12:17,143
That was ready for you

4547
02:12:18,580 --> 02:12:20,300
and tell this came out.

4548
02:12:20,690 --> 02:12:22,940
Basically any blood tests done from,

4549
02:12:23,030 --> 02:12:23,510
uh,

4550
02:12:23,510 --> 02:12:26,150
from our athlete had to be
done with the phlebotomist.

4551
02:12:26,630 --> 02:12:29,540
The full on needle in the
vein take out a vial of blood.

4552
02:12:30,050 --> 02:12:31,460
So with this leaching device,

4553
02:12:31,461 --> 02:12:34,730
it's got 30 micro needles in it.

4554
02:12:34,880 --> 02:12:36,380
The size about eyelash,

4555
02:12:36,830 --> 02:12:38,060
you put it up on your arm,

4556
02:12:38,830 --> 02:12:43,040
you hit this button and painlessly
the microneedles reach into just the

4557
02:12:43,041 --> 02:12:43,641
capillary.

4558
02:12:43,641 --> 02:12:45,320
So just the blood of the top of the,

4559
02:12:45,321 --> 02:12:45,890
uh,

4560
02:12:45,890 --> 02:12:48,920
of the skin and draw out
a small amount of blood.

4561
02:12:49,070 --> 02:12:49,570
And this,

4562
02:12:49,570 --> 02:12:50,840
this light turns red.

4563
02:12:50,870 --> 02:12:52,040
When that blood's drawn out.

4564
02:12:52,190 --> 02:12:52,880
Whoa.

4565
02:12:52,880 --> 02:12:55,310
The blood is then deposited onto a,

4566
02:12:55,400 --> 02:12:56,360
an index card.

4567
02:12:56,510 --> 02:12:58,220
It's called dried blood spot testing.

4568
02:12:58,221 --> 02:13:01,550
So a drop or two of blood
on the four corners,

4569
02:13:01,970 --> 02:13:03,380
the cards then sealed up,

4570
02:13:03,710 --> 02:13:06,710
placed in the mail and
sent to a water laboratory.

4571
02:13:07,250 --> 02:13:09,440
This is all have to be
done on video so that no,

4572
02:13:09,441 --> 02:13:10,400
well you have a color.

4573
02:13:10,430 --> 02:13:13,220
It's not the athlete doing themselves
can have a collector doing that.

4574
02:13:13,221 --> 02:13:13,371
I mean,

4575
02:13:13,371 --> 02:13:16,460
that could be the future where an
athlete is doing it themselves,

4576
02:13:16,480 --> 02:13:17,720
but then facetime or something.

4577
02:13:17,721 --> 02:13:18,291
Exactly.

4578
02:13:18,291 --> 02:13:18,530
But,

4579
02:13:18,530 --> 02:13:20,540
but here are the benefits of that a,

4580
02:13:20,541 --> 02:13:20,991
and this is,

4581
02:13:20,991 --> 02:13:21,980
this is huge for me.

4582
02:13:21,980 --> 02:13:25,040
I want to make things as convenient
for our athletes as possible.

4583
02:13:25,041 --> 02:13:25,580
So,

4584
02:13:25,580 --> 02:13:25,881
you know,

4585
02:13:25,881 --> 02:13:27,560
you talked to our roster and ask them,

4586
02:13:27,561 --> 02:13:31,950
would you prefer big needle stuck in the
vein of your arm and a of blood taken

4587
02:13:31,951 --> 02:13:33,930
out versus completely painless,

4588
02:13:34,260 --> 02:13:34,800
um,

4589
02:13:34,800 --> 02:13:35,041
you know,

4590
02:13:35,041 --> 02:13:36,870
leach of some blood from your capillaries.

4591
02:13:36,871 --> 02:13:37,681
They're all gonna say,

4592
02:13:37,681 --> 02:13:38,580
obviously this,

4593
02:13:39,270 --> 02:13:40,470
you talk about cost.

4594
02:13:40,920 --> 02:13:41,753
So,

4595
02:13:41,830 --> 02:13:42,540
uh,

4596
02:13:42,540 --> 02:13:45,330
blood taken out of a vein in
your arm requires a phlebotomist.

4597
02:13:45,331 --> 02:13:47,790
So in those cases where you
saw it as doing a blood test,

4598
02:13:47,791 --> 02:13:51,510
they usually take a drug collection
officer and a phlebotomist to take out of

4599
02:13:51,511 --> 02:13:52,950
the blood to take out the blood.

4600
02:13:53,070 --> 02:13:53,580
I mean that's,

4601
02:13:53,580 --> 02:13:55,200
that's a couple hundred dollars there.

4602
02:13:55,920 --> 02:13:56,580
Um,

4603
02:13:56,580 --> 02:14:00,480
a vial of blood needs to be cold
shipped to the water laboratories.

4604
02:14:00,481 --> 02:14:04,560
Here you're talking about dried blood
on an index card that just needs to be

4605
02:14:04,561 --> 02:14:05,190
sealed up.

4606
02:14:05,190 --> 02:14:09,720
It becomes tamper proof once it is
and put it in the mail for 55 cents.

4607
02:14:09,840 --> 02:14:10,350
Wow.

4608
02:14:10,350 --> 02:14:10,980
Um,

4609
02:14:10,980 --> 02:14:13,230
so I think incredible efficiency,

4610
02:14:13,380 --> 02:14:15,690
convenience to the
athlete for our program.

4611
02:14:15,750 --> 02:14:16,583
And again,

4612
02:14:16,740 --> 02:14:18,300
we want to lead and I think,

4613
02:14:18,330 --> 02:14:19,080
you know,

4614
02:14:19,080 --> 02:14:23,520
when you talk about a master's question
regularly about local or regional,

4615
02:14:23,521 --> 02:14:24,480
and then may show saying,

4616
02:14:24,481 --> 02:14:24,601
hey,

4617
02:14:24,601 --> 02:14:26,760
this is great what you guys
are doing for your program,

4618
02:14:26,761 --> 02:14:28,560
but how much does this program costs you?

4619
02:14:28,561 --> 02:14:31,410
And it is a multimillion
dollar program in a year.

4620
02:14:31,860 --> 02:14:32,251
And they say,

4621
02:14:32,251 --> 02:14:32,341
Hey,

4622
02:14:32,341 --> 02:14:33,630
we love to do something like that,

4623
02:14:33,631 --> 02:14:34,380
but you know,

4624
02:14:34,380 --> 02:14:35,490
we can't afford that.

4625
02:14:35,550 --> 02:14:39,840
Something like this where now you cut
your costs down from sending blood to,

4626
02:14:40,280 --> 02:14:40,561
you know,

4627
02:14:40,561 --> 02:14:42,660
for maybe thousand dollars to,

4628
02:14:42,720 --> 02:14:42,960
you know,

4629
02:14:42,960 --> 02:14:44,160
maybe a hundred dollars,

4630
02:14:44,161 --> 02:14:47,370
this device in one DCL going to
collect it out and put it on a card.

4631
02:14:47,910 --> 02:14:49,800
I think it has some
really great implications,

4632
02:14:49,801 --> 02:14:50,940
not just for the UFC,

4633
02:14:50,941 --> 02:14:51,541
but you know,

4634
02:14:51,541 --> 02:14:52,500
throughout the sport.

4635
02:14:52,620 --> 02:14:53,340
Can I see that thing?

4636
02:14:53,340 --> 02:14:53,910
Sure.

4637
02:14:53,910 --> 02:14:54,840
It was pretty bad ass.

4638
02:14:55,170 --> 02:14:56,003
Wow.

4639
02:14:57,570 --> 02:14:58,403
Wow.

4640
02:14:58,770 --> 02:14:59,603
Incredible.

4641
02:15:00,080 --> 02:15:00,570
Um,

4642
02:15:00,570 --> 02:15:01,290
anything else?

4643
02:15:01,290 --> 02:15:02,100
Should we wrap this up?

4644
02:15:02,100 --> 02:15:02,700
We're good.

4645
02:15:02,700 --> 02:15:02,911
Yeah,

4646
02:15:02,911 --> 02:15:03,610
man.

4647
02:15:03,610 --> 02:15:04,081
I think I'm good.

4648
02:15:04,081 --> 02:15:05,760
Unless you got anything
else doing an amazing job.

4649
02:15:05,790 --> 02:15:06,240
I mean,

4650
02:15:06,240 --> 02:15:06,871
it's just,

4651
02:15:06,871 --> 02:15:07,651
it's incredible.

4652
02:15:07,651 --> 02:15:08,340
The results.

4653
02:15:08,340 --> 02:15:09,060
It's a,

4654
02:15:09,060 --> 02:15:12,420
it's so cool to see the results on
the biological passport that you get.

4655
02:15:12,421 --> 02:15:14,910
You guys could show it in a chart and,

4656
02:15:14,911 --> 02:15:15,240
um,

4657
02:15:15,240 --> 02:15:18,180
I mean it pretty much everyone agrees.

4658
02:15:18,181 --> 02:15:18,391
I mean,

4659
02:15:18,391 --> 02:15:18,681
it's just,

4660
02:15:18,681 --> 02:15:21,060
it's really changed
the nature of fighting.

4661
02:15:21,061 --> 02:15:21,691
It really has,

4662
02:15:21,691 --> 02:15:22,650
it changed the sport.

4663
02:15:22,651 --> 02:15:23,330
It changed.

4664
02:15:23,330 --> 02:15:25,470
It's almost eliminated doping.

4665
02:15:25,980 --> 02:15:26,550
Yeah.

4666
02:15:26,550 --> 02:15:27,383
I really appreciate it.

4667
02:15:27,420 --> 02:15:27,871
As I told you,

4668
02:15:27,871 --> 02:15:29,490
I really appreciate the
platform you have here.

4669
02:15:29,491 --> 02:15:32,070
Literally every fighter
in and camp and manager,

4670
02:15:32,100 --> 02:15:32,311
you know,

4671
02:15:32,311 --> 02:15:33,480
on our roster watches this.

4672
02:15:33,481 --> 02:15:36,090
So it'd be able to get in
and talk about these things.

4673
02:15:36,091 --> 02:15:37,560
Talk about that new technology.

4674
02:15:37,561 --> 02:15:41,640
We just use that actually I think rose
Nama Junis was the first fight or that

4675
02:15:41,641 --> 02:15:42,900
you sought to try that out on,

4676
02:15:42,901 --> 02:15:44,450
so a center tax tactical.

4677
02:15:44,450 --> 02:15:44,851
Hey rose,

4678
02:15:44,851 --> 02:15:45,440
I heard they,

4679
02:15:45,440 --> 02:15:47,300
they did the leaching
device and the blood,

4680
02:15:47,360 --> 02:15:48,820
the dried blood spot tests.

4681
02:15:48,840 --> 02:15:51,360
Would you think she said awesome.

4682
02:15:51,440 --> 02:15:53,040
It didn't feel a thing and she said,

4683
02:15:53,070 --> 02:15:58,070
my mind is blown by the tech how far
technology's come here and that's a big

4684
02:15:58,081 --> 02:16:01,860
part of anti-doping and that deterrent
when you're now saying look at how the

4685
02:16:01,861 --> 02:16:05,670
technology is evolving here and
you get an athlete that thinks,

4686
02:16:05,671 --> 02:16:09,210
well you know I think I can out
with them or out cat and mouse them.

4687
02:16:09,211 --> 02:16:13,140
They see shit like this that are going
to think and perceptions almost as

4688
02:16:13,290 --> 02:16:16,560
important as reality and a lot of these
occasions and they start seeing things

4689
02:16:16,561 --> 02:16:20,130
like this and that deterrent factors
built up I think higher and higher.

4690
02:16:20,150 --> 02:16:20,290
Yeah.

4691
02:16:20,290 --> 02:16:23,280
It seems like at one point in time there
was a race and the dopers we're just

4692
02:16:23,281 --> 02:16:25,260
like one half step ahead.

4693
02:16:25,260 --> 02:16:27,480
But now it seems like it's even,

4694
02:16:27,510 --> 02:16:32,290
and with the possibility of freezing your
sample and then looking towards it to

4695
02:16:32,291 --> 02:16:33,124
the future,

4696
02:16:33,670 --> 02:16:34,720
it's not worth it.

4697
02:16:34,740 --> 02:16:35,110
Yeah.

4698
02:16:35,110 --> 02:16:36,460
I don't know if I call it even yet,

4699
02:16:36,461 --> 02:16:38,740
but that goes is definitely
narrowing and you're,

4700
02:16:38,800 --> 02:16:42,490
you're affecting the way that
dopers are doping these days.

4701
02:16:42,491 --> 02:16:43,211
I think you know,

4702
02:16:43,211 --> 02:16:44,044
now the,

4703
02:16:44,140 --> 02:16:44,620
the,

4704
02:16:44,620 --> 02:16:47,030
you know microdosing I
think is big and it's,

4705
02:16:47,060 --> 02:16:51,290
it's difficult to catch microdosing but
you've altered the behavior of the doper

4706
02:16:51,330 --> 02:16:56,330
from taking drugs really unabated to
very small amounts of the benefits aren't

4707
02:16:56,651 --> 02:16:57,311
going to be as great.

4708
02:16:57,311 --> 02:17:00,280
I think you got to consider
that a win for anti doping.

4709
02:17:00,281 --> 02:17:01,610
I think that gap continues to,

4710
02:17:01,611 --> 02:17:03,850
to narrow and when they
microdose like what,

4711
02:17:03,851 --> 02:17:07,180
what it like say would that be like
testosterone or something like that?

4712
02:17:07,210 --> 02:17:08,350
Testosterone Epo.

4713
02:17:08,351 --> 02:17:12,580
Probably the two most common vary how
much of a window of detection matter of

4714
02:17:12,581 --> 02:17:14,410
hours,

4715
02:17:14,410 --> 02:17:14,410
hours.

4716
02:17:14,410 --> 02:17:15,040
But you know,

4717
02:17:15,040 --> 02:17:15,431
again,

4718
02:17:15,431 --> 02:17:16,264
going back to,

4719
02:17:16,400 --> 02:17:18,490
I think I might've told this
story last time I was on,

4720
02:17:18,491 --> 02:17:20,650
but the Floyd Landis Lance days,

4721
02:17:21,190 --> 02:17:24,610
they were manipulating during the
Tour de France and eight hour window.

4722
02:17:24,850 --> 02:17:29,230
So from 10:00 PM to 6:00 AM they
wouldn't test them during the tour of the

4723
02:17:29,231 --> 02:17:32,590
thought was these guys are racing
up side of the mountain for five,

4724
02:17:32,591 --> 02:17:33,221
six hours a day.

4725
02:17:33,221 --> 02:17:34,330
We got to let these guys sleep.

4726
02:17:34,930 --> 02:17:35,770
And they figured out,

4727
02:17:35,771 --> 02:17:35,891
hey,

4728
02:17:35,891 --> 02:17:39,400
if we do something at 10 oh one by 601
there are list of tests or can come.

4729
02:17:39,401 --> 02:17:40,234
It'd be clear.

4730
02:17:40,750 --> 02:17:41,560
Um,

4731
02:17:41,560 --> 02:17:42,440
so you know,

4732
02:17:42,460 --> 02:17:42,641
yeah,

4733
02:17:42,641 --> 02:17:44,140
that prospect's all is out there.

4734
02:17:44,170 --> 02:17:45,490
That's why the UFC program,

4735
02:17:45,491 --> 02:17:46,990
there's no limits on the test now.

4736
02:17:47,020 --> 02:17:47,800
Right.

4737
02:17:47,800 --> 02:17:48,521
It's just a bummer.

4738
02:17:48,521 --> 02:17:50,230
It's in terms of their sleep side is,

4739
02:17:50,290 --> 02:17:50,620
yeah,

4740
02:17:50,620 --> 02:17:51,191
it's brutal.

4741
02:17:51,191 --> 02:17:52,000
But I think,

4742
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:52,241
you know,

4743
02:17:52,241 --> 02:17:53,870
I think most appreciate that that's,

4744
02:17:53,900 --> 02:17:55,120
that's the price of,

4745
02:17:55,180 --> 02:17:55,540
you know,

4746
02:17:55,540 --> 02:17:57,160
clean sport and tried to ensure,

4747
02:17:57,220 --> 02:17:59,050
would there be a way to change that?

4748
02:17:59,080 --> 02:18:02,620
Like would there be some
sort of a wearable device
that would detect changes in

4749
02:18:02,621 --> 02:18:03,220
your body?

4750
02:18:03,220 --> 02:18:04,090
I've often thought that.

4751
02:18:04,110 --> 02:18:05,320
How about a wearable device?

4752
02:18:05,321 --> 02:18:06,130
It was top secret.

4753
02:18:06,130 --> 02:18:09,820
They collected everything 24 hours a day
that you peel it off after a couple of

4754
02:18:09,820 --> 02:18:10,210
weeks and it's,

4755
02:18:10,210 --> 02:18:14,530
and it's tested or give
them the wearable device.

4756
02:18:14,830 --> 02:18:16,270
So when they're sleeping,

4757
02:18:16,271 --> 02:18:17,790
so you don't interrupt our sleep cycles.

4758
02:18:17,791 --> 02:18:21,670
So 10:00 PM to 8:00 AM or whatever it is
that you decide it would be the window

4759
02:18:21,671 --> 02:18:22,600
that they need to sleep.

4760
02:18:23,020 --> 02:18:24,490
While they're doing that,

4761
02:18:24,491 --> 02:18:28,090
they must have this device on that
detects any changes to their metabolism,

4762
02:18:28,120 --> 02:18:29,200
any changes in input,

4763
02:18:29,201 --> 02:18:30,400
and then they can't eat while they're on.

4764
02:18:30,830 --> 02:18:31,271
This is we,

4765
02:18:31,271 --> 02:18:31,661
believe me,

4766
02:18:31,661 --> 02:18:34,150
the anti-doping community is
always thinking about things.

4767
02:18:34,151 --> 02:18:35,650
I talked to Travis Tygart,

4768
02:18:35,651 --> 02:18:37,570
the CEO of Usada last week,

4769
02:18:37,571 --> 02:18:38,380
and he,

4770
02:18:38,380 --> 02:18:38,591
you know,

4771
02:18:38,591 --> 02:18:43,420
he made it clear and that you saw that
I think dedicates $3 million a year

4772
02:18:43,450 --> 02:18:46,000
grants toward research and anti-doping,

4773
02:18:46,001 --> 02:18:46,751
things like that.

4774
02:18:46,751 --> 02:18:47,630
So I mean that,

4775
02:18:47,690 --> 02:18:51,160
that race is always going
on and is always continuing.

4776
02:18:51,430 --> 02:18:52,263
Beautiful.

4777
02:18:53,080 --> 02:18:53,650
Great work.

4778
02:18:53,650 --> 02:18:54,370
Mr Novitsky,

4779
02:18:54,370 --> 02:18:55,660
I'm sorry about the nickname.

4780
02:18:56,380 --> 02:18:56,560
Oh,

4781
02:18:56,560 --> 02:18:57,310
get over it.

4782
02:18:57,310 --> 02:18:58,700
You're okay with us right off the bat.

4783
02:18:59,140 --> 02:18:59,561
Beautiful.

4784
02:18:59,561 --> 02:19:00,011
Thanks brother.

4785
02:19:00,011 --> 02:19:00,461
Appreciate it,

4786
02:19:00,461 --> 02:19:00,581
man.

4787
02:19:00,581 --> 02:19:00,810
All right.
