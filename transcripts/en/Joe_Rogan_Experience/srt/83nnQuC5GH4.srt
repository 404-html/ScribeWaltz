1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:02,470
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:09,750
This is them push you like this,

3
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:12,043
a Mustang.

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:16,290
The more that the guy that
trains the most the system is,

5
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:18,690
XML is the best.

6
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:20,083
You know,

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,270
every time,

8
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:23,400
every time you see,

9
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,353
look at this,

10
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:30,050
you just take four because I
stay in the national team for

11
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,830
almost 15 [inaudible] 15 yeah,

12
00:00:34,831 --> 00:00:37,260
15 years I staying in the Olympic Center.

13
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,370
Um,

14
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,180
you can imagine it.

15
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:43,103
It's Tay.

16
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:48,930
We that Tang guys for 15 years
and they're 15 years Tang.

17
00:00:53,161 --> 00:00:53,530
Guys,

18
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:54,750
I want to kill you.

19
00:00:59,120 --> 00:00:59,953
You can.

20
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:01,423
Yeah,

21
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:02,270
yeah,

22
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,193
yeah.

23
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:04,213
Listen,

24
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:09,340
look what the song as soon building,

25
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:10,203
you know,

26
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,093
building,

27
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,340
he did a Mooc a quarter.

28
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:14,140
It's a building with a lot of rooms,

29
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,440
but I basically cannot quite a conference.

30
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:16,920
Come on.

31
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,470
What with you?

32
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:18,010
Sorry.

33
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:19,120
Look what that was again.

34
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:19,991
That's in my room.

35
00:01:19,991 --> 00:01:20,261
That's it.

36
00:01:20,261 --> 00:01:21,310
They ruined for the,

37
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:22,541
I'm not a guy,

38
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:24,320
but this guy is the same.

39
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:24,810
Damn.

40
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:25,660
I said division.

41
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,370
[inaudible] he can see it for 15 years.

42
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:30,721
Everything.

43
00:01:30,721 --> 00:01:32,510
What are you're doing Addison,

44
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:35,620
where you eat every single
you when you're sick.

45
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:36,521
Everything.

46
00:01:36,521 --> 00:01:38,710
He know you are about everything.

47
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:39,450
Hmm.

48
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,070
So you live with your opponents.

49
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,810
They know when you're sick.

50
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,381
They know.

51
00:01:43,381 --> 00:01:46,650
It's not like where when you're
fighting a Matt Brown and he was,

52
00:01:46,651 --> 00:01:49,200
he's in Kentucky and
you're in Denver training.

53
00:01:49,201 --> 00:01:51,330
Nobody knows what's going on there.

54
00:01:51,331 --> 00:01:52,200
They train.

55
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,730
So you know what I'm doing.

56
00:01:53,731 --> 00:01:54,570
I know what you're doing.

57
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,060
So we're all on the same floor.

58
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,930
They do it like that to build that,

59
00:01:59,190 --> 00:01:59,461
you know,

60
00:01:59,461 --> 00:02:02,070
whatever the hell that
building versus for sure.

61
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:03,863
Come on.

62
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,160
Do you know how you
prepare yourself mentally?

63
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:09,843
How do you

64
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:11,203
Tina,

65
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:13,341
but dad,

66
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:14,174
I'm in internet marketing.

67
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:16,340
You have to become a fucking machine.

68
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,850
But it's not only machine in the fight.

69
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:20,960
In the fight.

70
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:21,201
No,

71
00:02:21,201 --> 00:02:21,291
no,

72
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:21,980
no.

73
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,720
My Shin and you life.

74
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:24,973
Yeah.

75
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:26,943
Femoral.

76
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:27,983
When you're sick,

77
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,510
she got her own beat.

78
00:02:29,511 --> 00:02:32,140
The heck go to this guy.

79
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:32,350
No.

80
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,183
Only one.

81
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:34,490
He says gang guys,

82
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:36,663
you know,

83
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,120
do you think it were
better than my monkey nut

84
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:42,800
in their yard?

85
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,300
A study or a mentee?

86
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,250
Yeah.

87
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,083
You got that.

88
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:47,920
Okay.

89
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,131
No,

90
00:02:48,131 --> 00:02:50,350
you have to become a
machine inside and out.

91
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:52,960
Those 10 guys know when you're sick.

92
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,670
They know when you get hurt.

93
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,350
So now I'm training with you,

94
00:02:56,351 --> 00:02:58,150
but I saw that you hurt
your wrist and training.

95
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,890
I'm going after fucking risk.

96
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,220
Right,

97
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:00,491
right,

98
00:03:00,491 --> 00:03:00,681
right.

99
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:01,271
You know what I'm saying?

100
00:03:01,271 --> 00:03:02,000
Like it's just,

101
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,310
it's,

102
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:02,671
it's,

103
00:03:02,671 --> 00:03:03,550
it's intense.

104
00:03:03,551 --> 00:03:06,850
So that's why he's the machine that he is.

105
00:03:06,851 --> 00:03:11,470
He says it only trains you to be a machine
on the outside but also trains you to

106
00:03:11,471 --> 00:03:12,670
be a machine on the inside.

107
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:13,941
Well,

108
00:03:13,941 --> 00:03:14,691
why would you do,

109
00:03:14,691 --> 00:03:17,240
what can you do so easy?

110
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:22,590
I'm dropping 25% tax on Chinese Jana.

111
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:24,741
And you know,

112
00:03:24,741 --> 00:03:27,200
I said to somebody that
is really the messenger,

113
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,850
the Messenger is important.

114
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:34,150
I could have one man say we're going
to tax you 25% and I can say another.

115
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:38,000
Listen,

116
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,833
your mother fuckers,

117
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:43,671
I'm telling you,

118
00:03:43,671 --> 00:03:44,504
man,

119
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,553
look

120
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,270
not in favor of the wall.

121
00:03:47,271 --> 00:03:52,160
I'm pro immigration that I'm not a favor
of these ice busts and all that jazz.

122
00:03:52,161 --> 00:03:54,020
But shit like that one's me over.

123
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,153
I said,

124
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,630
well,

125
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:59,330
I just love the fact that the
guy's the fucking president.

126
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:00,261
And he said,

127
00:04:00,261 --> 00:04:00,651
listen,

128
00:04:00,651 --> 00:04:01,430
you motherfuckers,

129
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,960
you got to pay 25% taxes.

130
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,610
It says eight years before the campaign.

131
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,570
It doesn't say how many years.

132
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:05,770
Oh,

133
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:06,460
I love,

134
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,060
oh is it?

135
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,290
This is 2011 it's old,

136
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,250
but he looks the sense,

137
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,900
but what's funny,

138
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,340
I was talking about it on a stage.

139
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:14,271
It's still ridiculous.

140
00:04:14,271 --> 00:04:17,300
I'm so tired of being yelled at by
like online about people hate them.

141
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:17,780
Like listen,

142
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,070
I'm not a huge fan of them either,

143
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,360
but so many people are like,

144
00:04:20,361 --> 00:04:20,721
I hate him.

145
00:04:20,721 --> 00:04:20,991
I hate him.

146
00:04:20,991 --> 00:04:22,100
I hate him that now.

147
00:04:22,101 --> 00:04:22,934
I kind of liked him.

148
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,231
Exactly like,

149
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:25,400
do you know how enough people say Shit?

150
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:25,701
They're like,

151
00:04:25,701 --> 00:04:26,271
fuck you.

152
00:04:26,271 --> 00:04:28,370
I'm so tired of you
telling me your opinion.

153
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,140
It's all the same to also,

154
00:04:30,141 --> 00:04:32,930
what annoys me is when
someone goes fucking moron.

155
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:33,950
That's like,

156
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:34,430
that's it.

157
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:34,760
That's all.

158
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,590
That's what you did.

159
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:35,801
You,

160
00:04:35,801 --> 00:04:36,021
you,

161
00:04:36,021 --> 00:04:36,201
you,

162
00:04:36,201 --> 00:04:38,420
you put like that's not
doing anything by going,

163
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,190
hey Trump shuck my dick.

164
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:41,211
All right dude.

165
00:04:41,211 --> 00:04:41,871
Well you got them.

166
00:04:41,871 --> 00:04:43,160
Here's my take on that.

167
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,151
If it's that,

168
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:44,960
if it's fucking moron,

169
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,130
you're not even supposed to listen.

170
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,660
That's supposed to not even go in.

171
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:48,200
I know.

172
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:48,920
Cause there's not a,

173
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,660
this is not effective communication.

174
00:04:50,661 --> 00:04:51,950
So if you engage that guy,

175
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,990
don't just completely waste your time.

176
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,910
Even if you get upset at you,

177
00:04:55,911 --> 00:04:56,930
completely waste your time.

178
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:57,910
I wipe it away,

179
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:58,760
but I see it and I'm like,

180
00:04:58,761 --> 00:04:58,851
oh,

181
00:04:58,851 --> 00:04:59,211
come on.

182
00:04:59,211 --> 00:05:02,480
This is the one that gets me
as Nazi fucking Nazi Nazi.

183
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:03,081
Oh yeah,

184
00:05:03,081 --> 00:05:05,090
he's a Nazi and you're a Nazi fascist.

185
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,600
They throw these words around.

186
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,420
They really don't even know
what the fuck they're saying.

187
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:11,750
Like if you really think that everybody
who looks likes Trump is a Nazi,

188
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:12,680
you're missing.

189
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,250
That's insane.

190
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,080
You're missing a giant point.

191
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:15,351
You're,

192
00:05:15,351 --> 00:05:16,670
you're fucking up everything.

193
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,990
You're ruining this conversation.

194
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:20,720
You're right about a lot of
the shitty does wrong here,

195
00:05:20,721 --> 00:05:22,670
but as soon as you say he's a Nazi right,

196
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:23,870
and that there's Nazi,

197
00:05:23,871 --> 00:05:24,531
everyone's a Nazi.

198
00:05:24,531 --> 00:05:27,530
Well then when real Nazis come around
have been to have a better name.

199
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:28,870
Yeah.

200
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:29,060
Yeah.

201
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,410
You can't really cook called Nazis.

202
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:33,590
He can't fucking take the
word Nazi and applied to shit.

203
00:05:33,591 --> 00:05:34,430
That's not Nazis.

204
00:05:34,431 --> 00:05:35,300
That's dangerous.

205
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:38,960
Like people say like
cost someone a murderer.

206
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:40,070
Why'd you call him a murderer?

207
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,870
Because he yelled and insult at that man.

208
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:42,620
Okay.

209
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,520
That's not a murderer.

210
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:43,940
Right?

211
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:44,870
But you can't do that.

212
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,730
Same thing with calling someone a Nazi.

213
00:05:46,731 --> 00:05:47,564
That's not a Nazi.

214
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:48,740
He might be a moron.

215
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,210
He might be a fool.

216
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:53,840
He might be into Trump just because
he's a dumb guy and he likes the fact

217
00:05:53,841 --> 00:05:55,070
there's a white guy in office.

218
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,600
But that doesn't mean he's a Nazi.

219
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:00,740
But it's also like the biggest
problem that I have is like you're,

220
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,840
it's still illegal to be an asshole.

221
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,700
It's not illegal to be a dick.

222
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:04,941
Right.

223
00:06:04,941 --> 00:06:05,390
If someone's,

224
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,970
if someone says something you don't
like where it's not against the law.

225
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:08,630
My,

226
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:09,463
my number one

227
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:14,270
concern with all this stuff is that I
think it's happening so fast and so many

228
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:18,320
things are taking place in
so many different realms
when it comes to innovation

229
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,280
that this stuff will just catch up to us
before we even recognize it's happened.

230
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:23,990
And it will be too late for sure.

231
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,320
I mean even just forget every single,

232
00:06:26,321 --> 00:06:27,470
let's even just the whole,

233
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:28,070
uh,

234
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,050
atomic bomb see,

235
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:33,290
should allow for the last ever since
we started from the 1940s to today,

236
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,910
there have been some
seriously close calls.

237
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:37,390
There was a,

238
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:37,940
um,

239
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,880
did you remember to one
that was wanting to 1980s,

240
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,470
I think right before the end of
the Cold War where there was,

241
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:43,131
you know,

242
00:06:43,131 --> 00:06:43,964
Russia,

243
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:44,781
you know,

244
00:06:44,781 --> 00:06:48,410
the guy goes to his boring job where they
are supposed to look for missiles from

245
00:06:48,411 --> 00:06:51,470
the United States and nothing ever
happened day after day after day.

246
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,080
And at one day there's a bleep
on the radar and you're like,

247
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,160
oh shit.

248
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:55,791
And he's the guy,

249
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,570
he's jaw but to clearly superior.

250
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:58,551
And then if he does,

251
00:06:58,551 --> 00:06:59,230
the outs are,

252
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:01,490
they are going to press the
button it and he's like,

253
00:07:01,491 --> 00:07:01,611
no,

254
00:07:01,611 --> 00:07:01,731
no,

255
00:07:01,731 --> 00:07:01,791
no,

256
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:01,970
no.

257
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:02,240
Wait,

258
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,290
let's come down.

259
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,580
Maybe this is wrong.

260
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:05,841
I made a concern,

261
00:07:05,841 --> 00:07:06,621
not that stupid.

262
00:07:06,621 --> 00:07:08,900
They will not send one atomic
bomb before they do it.

263
00:07:08,901 --> 00:07:09,651
They send a bunch.

264
00:07:09,651 --> 00:07:10,910
So these must be a mistake.

265
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:11,530
Let's hold it,

266
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,580
relax three minutes later.

267
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:15,080
And other beliefs and
other belief and other,

268
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:15,710
he's like,

269
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:16,130
Oh shit,

270
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:17,900
they're setting to get
a bunch of atomic bombs.

271
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,040
These is the real deal.

272
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:20,271
And the guy,

273
00:07:20,271 --> 00:07:22,460
Steele doesn't do what he's supposed to.

274
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:25,310
He's feels like if I make this call,

275
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,870
nuclear war starts,

276
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,530
I need to be [inaudible]
was in percent convenes.

277
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,970
The evidence in front
of them is pretty solid,

278
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:33,710
but I still don't feel it.

279
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:36,200
And then five minutes later
all the beliefs go off.

280
00:07:36,201 --> 00:07:39,850
It was a mistake on the radar and it
was like some random bleep and uh,

281
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,360
the guy probably drank a bottle of
vodka straight because he was like,

282
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,960
do you know the almost
caused world war three?

283
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:47,803
Exactly.

284
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,860
And you know,

285
00:07:48,861 --> 00:07:49,910
most off ours,

286
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,590
all their lives now to some
Russian dude in the 1980s,

287
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,150
who decided not to do
what he was supposed to.

288
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,710
And then because of the stupid mistake,

289
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:02,300
stupid bug in the radar,

290
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,310
that's a pretty open ended

291
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:05,281
description,

292
00:08:05,281 --> 00:08:05,580
right?

293
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:05,791
Oh,

294
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:07,170
it's so open ended.

295
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,830
There were so many like weird
performance art things that would happen.

296
00:08:10,831 --> 00:08:10,951
We,

297
00:08:10,951 --> 00:08:11,191
I mean,

298
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:12,660
we had performance art class.

299
00:08:12,661 --> 00:08:17,040
There was a guy that like
taped his genitals to the
side and put on lipstick in

300
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:22,041
a mirror and that was his performance
art piece or the girl that night and we

301
00:08:22,501 --> 00:08:23,860
would all sit there and watch it.

302
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:27,060
Did you see his genitals?

303
00:08:27,061 --> 00:08:29,940
Did he go naked and pull it
aside or how did he do that?

304
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,470
That's a really good question.

305
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:33,490
And I like how your mind just went there.

306
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:33,841
You're like,

307
00:08:33,841 --> 00:08:34,950
what actually happened?

308
00:08:34,951 --> 00:08:36,300
I think I blocked it out

309
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:41,520
because I think you could probably get
away with doing that under the guise of

310
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,140
it being something you're doing,

311
00:08:43,141 --> 00:08:43,580
you know,

312
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,160
in a class somewhere.

313
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:46,891
Yes.

314
00:08:46,891 --> 00:08:47,760
You get away with us.

315
00:08:47,761 --> 00:08:50,460
So pervy I think I was
focused on his beautiful lips.

316
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,590
I was trying to be polite
and not look down there.

317
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:55,590
Another woman was obese and her was,

318
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:57,060
she had preset up.

319
00:08:57,061 --> 00:08:59,040
We weren't it where she
was doing the performance,

320
00:08:59,410 --> 00:08:59,940
uh,

321
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,280
butter pats in like dominoes,

322
00:09:02,281 --> 00:09:02,880
like a,

323
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,241
you know,

324
00:09:03,241 --> 00:09:07,500
a few thousand of them in a line and
she was obese and she crawled on the

325
00:09:07,501 --> 00:09:08,334
ground.

326
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:09,480
She didn't actually eat them,

327
00:09:09,481 --> 00:09:11,940
but it was something that's weird.

328
00:09:11,941 --> 00:09:13,380
My mind kind of drops off.

329
00:09:13,381 --> 00:09:14,910
I remember specific parts of it,

330
00:09:14,911 --> 00:09:15,330
but I don't,

331
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:19,710
I think she just was collecting the butter
pieces and crawling and that was her

332
00:09:19,711 --> 00:09:20,161
performance.

333
00:09:20,161 --> 00:09:21,120
These another guy,

334
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,633
uh,

335
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:23,100
the,

336
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:23,340
uh,

337
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:23,761
this was,

338
00:09:23,761 --> 00:09:26,190
I went to Detroit and then
finished in San Francisco.

339
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:30,480
And San Francisco is known for being
a real performance art history.

340
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:31,763
A lot of the,

341
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:32,041
you know,

342
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:33,870
the most famous performance artist.

343
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,700
Nobody knows where that was.

344
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:36,990
The scene was in San Francisco.

345
00:09:36,991 --> 00:09:37,330
So,

346
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:38,163
uh,

347
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:41,250
it was two story really
beautiful campus overlooking,

348
00:09:41,251 --> 00:09:43,110
you could see a Lombard
street on one side.

349
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:44,460
You could see the water on the other side.

350
00:09:44,461 --> 00:09:45,240
And uh,

351
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:50,240
another guy's piece was to jump from the
second story to a tree just like that.

352
00:09:51,271 --> 00:09:55,680
He may or may not have made
the jump and that was his art,

353
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:59,130
his art pieces of jumping
from a window to a tree.

354
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,030
Yeah.

355
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:00,990
What the fuck?

356
00:10:00,991 --> 00:10:02,850
I know this other guy,

357
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:05,340
the room where we had our class,

358
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:07,830
he had a bread machine.

359
00:10:07,831 --> 00:10:08,491
This was back,

360
00:10:08,491 --> 00:10:08,761
you know,

361
00:10:08,761 --> 00:10:12,310
bread machines where new
technology at a breadmaker,

362
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,081
you know those machines,

363
00:10:13,081 --> 00:10:13,770
you can make it.

364
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:15,300
I guess it just does the dough,

365
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:15,800
right?

366
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,820
Or maybe it bakes it.

367
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,240
I think it just needs the dough.

368
00:10:18,241 --> 00:10:19,140
And then you bake it,

369
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:21,090
or I don't know if you bake
it in the machine or no,

370
00:10:21,091 --> 00:10:22,040
you bake it in the machine.

371
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:22,861
It's all coming back to me.

372
00:10:22,861 --> 00:10:23,850
He bakes it in the machine.

373
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,880
We come into the classroom
as he's baking it,

374
00:10:26,881 --> 00:10:28,710
there's always like a
reveal and these pieces,

375
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:28,981
right?

376
00:10:28,981 --> 00:10:29,910
So we come in,

377
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:34,260
he's taken plaster from the
wall and put it in the bread.

378
00:10:34,261 --> 00:10:35,790
He's Fed us the bread.

379
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:38,550
Half of us get it,

380
00:10:38,551 --> 00:10:39,630
half of us don't.

381
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,440
And there's plaster and the bread.

382
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:45,120
Why do you put plaster and his bread?

383
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:49,020
It was something about communism.

384
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:54,240
Some good the bread,

385
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,133
some don't.

386
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,790
But even if you get the bread,

387
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:57,690
there's plaster.

388
00:10:57,691 --> 00:10:59,640
And so in your face,

389
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:01,320
what the fuck?

390
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:03,480
Oh my God.
