1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:02,820
Here we go.
Four,

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,100
three,
two,

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:10,130
one.
Get the sound of this popping up too.

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,900
Lazy Gentleman.
He just popped open and makers to taught

5
00:00:12,901 --> 00:00:15,300
me sober.
October.

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,220
Can we look it?
Let me hear that.

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,260
Let me hear that.
Oh,

8
00:00:19,261 --> 00:00:21,340
that does sound lovely.
Oh,

9
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:27,290
this one's for.
This one's for fat Bert and 11.

10
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:31,070
I have 20 days.
Twenty days of sobriety then.

11
00:00:31,071 --> 00:00:33,720
Ain't shit already did 11.
But let me tell you something.

12
00:00:33,721 --> 00:00:34,554
What I've learned from this is we were 
talking about before the podcast 

13
00:00:36,481 --> 00:00:37,620
started.
Want to hear me?

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,160
I'm going to pour some coffee.
Like an alcoholic.

15
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,960
It's a fucking a meeting.
I need a cigar.

16
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:48,400
I'm Joe Garcia.
Don't,

17
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:49,620
don't have cigars there.
I do.

18
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:54,010
Right there in one of these things.
I'm.

19
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:55,943
One of the things that I realized is 
that if you work out like I'm working 

20
00:00:59,221 --> 00:01:00,054
out like fucking three hours a day 
because I'm literally trying to kill 

21
00:01:02,761 --> 00:01:03,090
Bert.

22
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,420
I want to try to keep up with me.
You want him to die though?

23
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:06,710
I'm trying to kill him.
Yeah.

24
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,510
I'm trying to give him a heart attack 
because you know what bothers me.

25
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:10,583
What?
This is all weed and there's mushrooms 

26
00:01:12,091 --> 00:01:15,380
in here and there's no cigarettes,
cigars,

27
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,830
I'm all good.
Shit.

28
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:20,920
Maybe I might've taken them out of here.
Homo door.

29
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:25,480
We're going to get a huge humidor for 
you are a human.

30
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,670
What I realized,
this is why I'm trying to kill bird.

31
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,240
Yeah.
He likes to pretend that he's in shape.

32
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:34,630
Effort.
Effort is spectacular.

33
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,473
You know,
likes to pretend that he can push 

34
00:01:37,381 --> 00:01:39,510
himself.
Then he's got this incredible will.

35
00:01:39,511 --> 00:01:42,210
He's in last place,
of course by quite a bit.

36
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:44,900
It's really sad.
Yeah.

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,833
And you know,
he takes days off when everybody 

38
00:01:47,371 --> 00:01:48,270
doesn't.
He take it.

39
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,070
I took three days off when I went to 
Vegas.

40
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,870
I'm still in the lead.
Yeah.

41
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:52,973
Well,
you know,

42
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,720
I've seen.
I've seen his cooking show.

43
00:01:54,721 --> 00:01:56,430
I know how I eat.
I've seen his fucking.

44
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,370
It's the booze man boost to his body.
I mean he's,

45
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:02,280
I'd love Bert and this is one of the 
reasons why I'm trying to kill him.

46
00:02:02,281 --> 00:02:03,930
I fucking hate him.
Let's fight burt.

47
00:02:03,931 --> 00:02:06,510
You son of a bitch.
Want them to realize like,

48
00:02:06,511 --> 00:02:07,344
this is not.
You're 10 years younger than me and you 

49
00:02:09,691 --> 00:02:11,580
have to take high blood pressure 
medication.

50
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,080
This is all not good.
Yeah.

51
00:02:13,081 --> 00:02:13,914
No,
it's not.

52
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,370
You're doing something terrible to your 
body by drinking every night.

53
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,080
You shouldn't do it.
What did you do?

54
00:02:19,081 --> 00:02:21,120
A bottle a night.
You think he gets down,

55
00:02:21,121 --> 00:02:21,570
dude?
Yeah.

56
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:22,590
Yeah.
Down drink.

57
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,710
He'll drink a whole box of wine when 
those box wines.

58
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,660
He's a friend frenzy.
Franzia freak.

59
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,920
He's an animal man.

60
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:32,160
He'll drink a whole Tito's like a whole 
jug and I've seen that.

61
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,051
I've seen that.
Go down.

62
00:02:33,051 --> 00:02:35,520
It's going on here.
He's freaking out the shirt off.

63
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:36,900
It takes his shirt off.
No Shit.

64
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,450
Does God look at that?
Look at that fucking stomach.

65
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,040
Here's the thing,
Kenny see his deck.

66
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,440
Do you think he sees his deck?
We can search for it.

67
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,060
Find it.
It's a heightened.

68
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:46,510
Heightened.
Go off.

69
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,750
What's the deal?
This is.

70
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:50,310
This is a podcast.
I saw this norton and hips.

71
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:51,930
He.
What was he?

72
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,793
He was saying on this halt as a wife or 
something and to ask about what about 

73
00:02:56,011 --> 00:02:58,170
sex and his kids.
His kids were in the car.

74
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,380
Yeah.
Wonderful.

75
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,220
Yeah.

76
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,520
Yeah,
any pan and he panics.

77
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:03,900
He hasn't done that before.
Shit hammered.

78
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,190
Um,
but uh,

79
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:10,720
Tom lost all the weight when they just 
had that weight loss challenge two years

80
00:03:10,721 --> 00:03:11,710
ago.
Not last year,

81
00:03:11,711 --> 00:03:13,270
the year before,
but score looks good.

82
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,030
Segora never gained it back.
No.

83
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,700
Yeah,
he looks fucking fabulous.

84
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:19,420
Fantastic.
And he's in the hunt.

85
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:22,150
It's like already in him or just behind 
me.

86
00:03:22,151 --> 00:03:25,490
Ran Him are neck and neck or number two 
and he's just behind art.

87
00:03:25,491 --> 00:03:28,870
And then cigarettes.
I mean when burt is way behind it,

88
00:03:28,871 --> 00:03:31,000
but already needs to lose no weight.
Zero.

89
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:31,780
Wait,
he's already,

90
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,770
he's already finished.
Fuck,

91
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,390
he's down to 180 pounds.
He said for the first time in decades.

92
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,350
What is e six,
three,

93
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:40,323
six,
four,

94
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,500
six.
That's got to be right for um,

95
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:43,383
but he looks great.
He's thin and healthy for a snarly 

96
00:03:46,781 --> 00:03:48,040
Jewish guy.
He looks good.

97
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,470
Spaces bad,
but his body looks good.

98
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,130
Little angry without the wheat that this
is helping him.

99
00:03:54,131 --> 00:03:57,220
And this is one of the things I was 
saying is that I'm working out,

100
00:03:57,221 --> 00:04:00,460
like I'm literally working out two,
sometimes three hours a day.

101
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,653
You do to,
you split it up or you just don't want 

102
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,180
to go high?
Go Ham.

103
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,650
Fuck,
I'll just go hard.

104
00:04:05,651 --> 00:04:08,890
I'll just mix things up like I'll run 
and then I'll come back from running and

105
00:04:08,891 --> 00:04:09,724
I'll kick box.
Then I have to kickbox I'll get on the 

106
00:04:11,021 --> 00:04:11,854
elliptical machine or I'll lift weights 
and after I lift weights and then I'll 

107
00:04:14,561 --> 00:04:15,394
get on the fucking echo bike.
You know the echo bike thing and then 

108
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:21,580
I'll get on the versaclimber and then 
I'll get on the rowing machine.

109
00:04:21,581 --> 00:04:23,700
I just do rounds when I can't run 
anymore.

110
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:25,690
Look at this fucking puddle.
I left behind.

111
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,910
This is a puddle on my elliptical 
machine.

112
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,120
She's fucking crazy.
Yeah,

113
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:30,963
I mean it was crazy.
This was two hours on the elliptical 

114
00:04:32,051 --> 00:04:36,430
machine and this was.
I just wanted to see what's possible and

115
00:04:36,431 --> 00:04:38,350
then how I felt the next day I felt 
fine.

116
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,720
The thing is I work out a lot already 
so,

117
00:04:41,721 --> 00:04:44,950
but now my body's just adjusting to like
a ramped up schedule.

118
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,480
It doesn't work out at all.
He hasn't worked out in 10 plus years.

119
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,610
So for him this is like a whole new 
thing,

120
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:52,683
but he still second place.
It's his mind or he's got a strong mind 

121
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:56,890
and he's,
he's,

122
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,793
he's got a will.
So what does the instagram was just 

123
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:00,970
gonna finish somewhere in the middle.
So my,

124
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,800
when he never know what you think will 
come,

125
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:03,940
come up,
probably won't beat me.

126
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,910
No,
there shouldn't be much anger.

127
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,160
Shouldn't be something big.
Big on the line.

128
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:10,230
Yeah.
There's nothing online.

129
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:13,480
Belt should be something big to finalize
that belt.

130
00:05:13,481 --> 00:05:14,720
Jamie,
some good artwork.

131
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:19,920
Which folks get at me on instagram.
So grandpa,

132
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:24,700
use the Hashtag.
Use like at Joe Rogan tagged me.

133
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:27,170
And if you win I'll give you 500 bucks.
Oh,

134
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:28,520
okay.
Look at that.

135
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:30,560
People are scrambling.
Depends,

136
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,433
writes up with the best design.
I'll give you 500 bucks if I don't 

137
00:05:34,361 --> 00:05:35,680
choose anybody.
Nobody gets shit.

138
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,930
We have an artist who's anybody.
You burn the money.

139
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,670
That's what Joe's going to do is going 
to burn it quick.

140
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,750
Yeah.
We need a quick.

141
00:05:40,751 --> 00:05:42,430
I have an artist is trying to work on it
too.

142
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,250
So there's a run,
there's like a,

143
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:47,170
there's a mad run here,
but um,

144
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,850
the um,
the,

145
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,210
what I was gonna say is all bullshit 
aside and jokes and I do love.

146
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:56,140
I do love everybody else doing this,
but all jokes aside,

147
00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:01,270
I have zero anxiety,
zero worry,

148
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,140
zero stress.

149
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:05,480
Like when you burn your body out like 
that,

150
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,550
do two hours of working out a day.
Not yet.

151
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:11,240
I don't give a fuck about anything.
Like I'm in traffic.

152
00:06:11,241 --> 00:06:12,230
People cut me off.
I'm like,

153
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:13,543
fuck,
fuck.

154
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,541
Go ahead.
Cut me off.

155
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,680
Dickhead.
Who Cares?

156
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:18,290
I'm not angry like it does nothing.
What is it?

157
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:19,124
Because your body will burn.
You think you're just so fucking 

158
00:06:20,331 --> 00:06:23,360
exhausted.
I think this is my feeling.

159
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:27,380
I feel a lot of those.
I have those feelings that you have,

160
00:06:27,381 --> 00:06:28,214
whether it's anxiety or stress,
it's just extra energy that your body 

161
00:06:31,431 --> 00:06:33,080
has.
It's unnecessary.

162
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,093
It's unnecessary energy and it's just 
like your body's looking for trouble 

163
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,500
that isn't there looking for danger,
that isn't.

164
00:06:39,501 --> 00:06:40,334
They're looking,
looking for something that's going to 

165
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:45,290
like steal your food or fade your 
village,

166
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,750
all that shit because who's going to 
kill my family?

167
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:48,973
Well,
I think your body has to have a certain 

168
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:50,720
way.

169
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,553
We're designed right for all the years 
that we were running away from wild 

170
00:06:54,351 --> 00:06:56,840
animals and other tribes and all that 
shit.

171
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:57,883
I think your,
your body and your brain have a certain 

172
00:07:01,641 --> 00:07:06,110
amount on reserve,
always looking for some sort of danger.

173
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:08,980
You're a see a deer in the wild that's 
like,

174
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:10,940
oh yeah,
twitchy and yeah,

175
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:11,863
they sit here and around the mountain 
lion outline is that a mountain is a 

176
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,950
mountain lion in my neighborhood by the 
way.

177
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:16,881
There is,
yeah.

178
00:07:16,881 --> 00:07:17,714
The neighborhoods.
One of the neighbor spotted a mountain 

179
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:21,380
lion.
You've got your fucking good luck.

180
00:07:21,381 --> 00:07:23,510
Shooting them out in line with.
Would be fun though.

181
00:07:23,511 --> 00:07:25,430
Huh?
You'd have to.

182
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,530
The odds of you shooting them out.
Yeah.

183
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:28,700
What is that?
That walks by.

184
00:07:28,701 --> 00:07:30,170
That lady.
Is that a cat?

185
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,670
That's a fucking.
No,

186
00:07:31,671 --> 00:07:32,504
that's not a cat.
It was a mountain lion because of how 

187
00:07:33,771 --> 00:07:36,410
it's tail popped up and it looks like a 
lion,

188
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,500
but it's just way too casual walking by 
her.

189
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:42,020
She doesn't give a fuck.
She doesn't know what it is.

190
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,720
It definitely looks like cat.
She thought it was a dog.

191
00:07:44,721 --> 00:07:46,910
Huh?
It kind of looks like a dog.

192
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,600
It's this way to calm the way it walks.
Buyer.

193
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:53,240
That's not a wild cat.
I think that's a dog man,

194
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:58,400
but it doesn't look like a dog.
Maybe a mountain lion made its debut.

195
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:01,010
Nobody knows what the fuck it is.
Fine or not.

196
00:08:01,011 --> 00:08:04,520
In wildlife experts are looking at that 
video and they'll see like,

197
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:07,310
I'm not a wildlife expert,
but I've seen a lot of wildlife.

198
00:08:07,311 --> 00:08:08,900
The tail does not look right at the 
tail.

199
00:08:08,901 --> 00:08:10,720
Looks like a cat does it?
Yeah.

200
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,230
Yeah,
it does see it again,

201
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,470
that tail definitely say cat doesn't 
look that good dog tail.

202
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:18,700
It looks like a balancing tail.
Like if you look at what's wrong.

203
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:19,490
Yes.
Yeah,

204
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:20,000
yeah,
yeah,

205
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,833
yeah.
It kind of does look like a fucking cat 

206
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:22,400
yet.
Let me say it again.

207
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,210
That's a fucking dog though.
It could be a dollar.

208
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,780
People trim their dog hair and they'd 
make a way.

209
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,010
Man.
It's like the tail.

210
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,870
It's holding its tail in the air.
See what I'm saying?

211
00:08:32,871 --> 00:08:33,471
Yeah,
it is.

212
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:35,590
We check the tracks and they were 
definitely dog tracks,

213
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:41,340
so it's a dog to dog.
It's my dad.

214
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,950
I told myself I wasn't going to say the 
f word anymore than I did.

215
00:08:45,951 --> 00:08:48,710
It snuck out talking about a dog and 
makes its way out.

216
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,180
I think this closet,
this dog identifies as a cat.

217
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,320
It did.
It did.

218
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:56,070
I heard the dog as a person.

219
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:58,860
Now that it doesn't.
It wants to be called cal Calvin.

220
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,760
That's his name.
Yeah.

221
00:08:59,761 --> 00:09:00,940
The dog says,
I'm Calvin.

222
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:03,600
Well,
you have to respect its feelings.

223
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:06,950
It has every right to be whatever it 
wants to be,

224
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,140
man.
You just assume that animals.

225
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:13,070
I fucked up.
I assumed it's identity.

226
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:13,920
It's identity.
Yeah.

227
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,690
That's fucked up.
That's a big mistake on my part.

228
00:09:15,691 --> 00:09:16,524
We've got a lot of fucking nerve Joe 
Rogan to have a lot of nerve that's 

229
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,633
fucking deeply embarrassed by myself.
You need to go to a support group for 

230
00:09:22,651 --> 00:09:26,250
people who think that dogs are dogs,
not even a cat.

231
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,113
Maybe it's just a century and being 
maybe identifies as like a sentient 

232
00:09:29,641 --> 00:09:30,660
being.
It's just a being.

233
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:33,810
It's an orb of energy on a dog.
Not a cat,

234
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,630
just a thing that exists.
Yeah,

235
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,940
and maybe we don't have the right to 
define it.

236
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:39,690
I got right.

237
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:42,540
You call something a cat by whose 
judgment?

238
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,250
By humans judged and that's a feminine 
word and you assigned to us.

239
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,600
Yeah.
You see a cat the way you said it sounds

240
00:09:48,601 --> 00:09:50,130
feminine,
but what about cool cat?

241
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,650
Like if you're a cool black guy,
he's like,

242
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,411
yeah,
he's a cool black.

243
00:09:52,411 --> 00:09:55,020
People have their rules don't apply.
They don't use that anymore.

244
00:09:55,021 --> 00:09:57,630
Do they?
Hardly anybody uses?

245
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:58,863
No.
No one's saying jive Turkey anymore 

246
00:09:59,671 --> 00:10:00,990
either.
Turkey was fun.

247
00:10:00,991 --> 00:10:01,860
I bet though,
for a while.

248
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,640
Who Do you think was the last guy to say
jive Turkey in all earnestness?

249
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,233
I think I saw like a shitty movie in the
nineties were somewhat like a black 

250
00:10:13,861 --> 00:10:15,690
comic use jive Turkey.
Oh,

251
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:16,643
nick cannon.
I saw thing and nick cannon lookup jive 

252
00:10:18,301 --> 00:10:19,490
Turkey.
Oh,

253
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,600
dead serious.
He's a jive Turkey.

254
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:22,470
Yeah.
Oh,

255
00:10:22,471 --> 00:10:23,304
but he was probably being silly.
You can't as a comedian in the loosest 

256
00:10:27,031 --> 00:10:30,100
sense of the word.
He does.

257
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,340
Comedy doesn't eat.
Sure.

258
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:34,200
He had a standup comedy special.
Sure.

259
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,150
Yeah.
Look at Jamie.

260
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:37,890
Yeah,
Jamie smirking,

261
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:40,800
it was called his standup comedy special
was called a stand up.

262
00:10:40,801 --> 00:10:43,380
Don't shoot that.
I'm dead serious.

263
00:10:43,381 --> 00:10:46,470
She's called stand up.
Don't shoot any war or any war.

264
00:10:46,471 --> 00:10:47,040
Uh,
um,

265
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,150
you know he wears like a,
a space suit.

266
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:50,670
Yeah.
What is it called?

267
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:52,320
Cat outfit.
He wears like a fucking.

268
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:56,040
What is it called when the Indian 
Muslim.

269
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:56,874
Headwear?
Yeah.

270
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,390
Doesn't he know?
No job.

271
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,261
Job Job?
Yeah.

272
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:02,640
He wears a job.
Yes he does.

273
00:11:02,641 --> 00:11:03,900
That's a fucking knit pant.
No,

274
00:11:03,901 --> 00:11:05,660
not,
but the cannon.

275
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:06,503
He job.
He wears the Shit fucking Howard stern 

276
00:11:08,881 --> 00:11:09,714
was giving him shit about it forever 
because he cute because he was wearing 

277
00:11:11,211 --> 00:11:12,690
it.
Watch out a little bit.

278
00:11:12,691 --> 00:11:14,250
You'll put a little camera.
Sold you bro.

279
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:16,350
He wears a turban.
Alright,

280
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:17,940
wait a minute.
What the fuck?

281
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,330
Nick Cannon explains his reason for 
wearing a turban.

282
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,210
Get to police on Ellen.

283
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:31,490
I just don't have any breath in my body.
What's this?

284
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:34,190
What is this explanation?
I don't remember what he said.

285
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,050
I don't know.
Some fucking bullshit.

286
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,210
A second.
You know me?

287
00:11:39,211 --> 00:11:41,760
I'm a conspiracy theorist.
I think the government did that.

288
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:45,290
They set her up.
What is that about Mariah not.

289
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:46,740
I was simple a minute.
Hold on a second.

290
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:48,960
Ellen.
Fifty eight.

291
00:11:48,961 --> 00:11:51,960
Then asked nick about Mariah's New 
Year's Eve.

292
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,040
Televise performance was marred

293
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,860
by technical difficulties and he said,
you know me,

294
00:11:56,861 --> 00:11:59,590
I'm a conspiracy theorist.
I think the government did that.

295
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:02,050
I think they set her up.
It was a distraction.

296
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:03,130
Oh,
his joking.

297
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:04,340
No,
no,

298
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,010
no.
See he said he was a comic.

299
00:12:06,011 --> 00:12:08,150
That was hilarious.
That was so good.

300
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:08,993
Funny.
Why does he say I like his white spawns 

301
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,240
jacket that's.
I've never seen a white one like that.

302
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:15,220
It's like an old school motorcycle 
jacket,

303
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,200
but it's white guys can't wear white 
jackets.

304
00:12:17,201 --> 00:12:19,020
That's why now they can't.
Sure they can.

305
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,400
You can't wear a white leather jacket.
I can with hoop earrings.

306
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:22,721
Okay.
Yeah.

307
00:12:22,721 --> 00:12:26,690
Go Latina hoop earrings.
I want to see you wear those.

308
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,590
If I had hair,
I wear braids.

309
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:31,310
That should be the bet.
Jackets.

310
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:33,220
Hoop earrings.
White guys.

311
00:12:33,221 --> 00:12:35,230
They don't seem to get called out for 
corn rows.

312
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:38,170
It's really a white girls can't wear 
cornrows.

313
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:38,850
Yeah,
but white guy.

314
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:39,683
I do see white guys with cornrows.
I don't ever see white guys are this 

315
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:42,543
nick cannon weight gain.
What would the fuck is wrong with 

316
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:46,060
people?
Let the guy gained a little weight.

317
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:48,190
You fucking idiots.
Worry about yourself.

318
00:12:48,191 --> 00:12:51,400
But reasoning for the turban,
I can't.

319
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:56,840
That picture that I posted on my 
instagram about the British,

320
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:01,720
Iraqi gender queer,
whatever the fuck is,

321
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:02,893
look at this.
Quantum physics really helped me 

322
00:13:04,031 --> 00:13:05,770
understand my queer identity.
Um,

323
00:13:05,771 --> 00:13:10,300
British Iraqi gay nonbinary and identify
as Muslim.

324
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,010
That is real.
By the way,

325
00:13:12,011 --> 00:13:14,560
this is a video if you go to,
um,

326
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:16,270
who's instagram?
Oh,

327
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:19,660
James Woods posted it on his twitter 
page.

328
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:23,320
If you go to James Woods twitter page 
and he says that's all egg,

329
00:13:23,321 --> 00:13:24,680
right?
That's what he said.

330
00:13:24,681 --> 00:13:25,391
It's funny.
Yeah.

331
00:13:25,391 --> 00:13:26,920
Or that's Sasha.
Sasha.

332
00:13:26,921 --> 00:13:27,800
Baron Cohen.
Yeah.

333
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,600
If you go to his twitter page and you 
find it from yesterday,

334
00:13:31,601 --> 00:13:32,434
that's where I saw it.
And there's an actual video that goes 

335
00:13:35,741 --> 00:13:36,940
along with it.
Now,

336
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:40,780
here's what's interesting.
When you listen to this person,

337
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:45,760
I don't want to know,
is this something.

338
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:51,310
It seems a very intelligent,
like very intelligent person.

339
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,200
Sure.
But yeah,

340
00:13:53,201 --> 00:13:54,034
he posts a lot.
All James Woods does all day is just 

341
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:57,370
drink coffee and talk shit about 
liberals.

342
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:58,263
Keep going down.

343
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,900
Yeah,
just keep going.

344
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:07,120
It was got some cavenaugh mixed in and 
he's got some fake news mixed in.

345
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,180
It's in there.
I like beer and tea.

346
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:11,860
You like beer?
Just two days ago.

347
00:14:11,861 --> 00:14:14,600
Now I keep going.
It might be in there.

348
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,780
Maybe deleted within a response to 
someone.

349
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:17,501
No,
no,

350
00:14:17,501 --> 00:14:19,480
no.
I don't think so.

351
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:22,210
Admired is Bam.
Okay.

352
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:24,310
Go live,
go large.

353
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:25,653
Go large on this.
Go logical line and bring it to the 

354
00:14:28,631 --> 00:14:30,910
beginning because this is quite 
political.

355
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,940
Hold on to the beginning.
Here we go.

356
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:36,143
My name is cody or Glam room and I see 
that you might categorize as 

357
00:14:40,621 --> 00:14:43,170
intersectional.
I'm British or rocky,

358
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:44,413
gay,
non binary and also identify as Muslim 

359
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:47,573
and the glittery quantum physics has 
makeup I've ever seen like any human 

360
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:51,823
entity,

361
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:55,280
quantum physics has helped them 
understand this queer identity.

362
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,770
Okay,
now listen,

363
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:01,190
she just fucking space cadet.
The pictures are insane.

364
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,233
The listen

365
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:03,973
glorious sect of physics that looks at 
the Subatomic particles that govern our 

366
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,880
world,
so inside the neutrons,

367
00:15:09,881 --> 00:15:14,880
electrons and the protons and looking at
Decaux leptons those hakes,

368
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:20,460
whereas classical newtonian physics is 
obsessed with the universal formula that

369
00:15:21,851 --> 00:15:25,480
governor reality.
It's so fixed on resolute answers.

370
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:30,840
Quantum physics reveals that there is no
fixed reality and it's full of beautiful

371
00:15:31,031 --> 00:15:32,110
contradictions.

372
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,700
Okay,
so here's my point.

373
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:38,180
You can keep going on and watch this,
but this is a very intelligent person.

374
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,540
So why am I so dismissive?
Why?

375
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:42,643
Why can't this person where like if a 
woman was beautiful and she wore like a 

376
00:15:47,601 --> 00:15:50,600
dark red lipstick,
but she was talking brilliant science,

377
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:54,650
I wouldn't have an issue with it.
So why do I have an issue with this Glam

378
00:15:54,651 --> 00:15:56,430
roof fella?
Character,

379
00:15:56,510 --> 00:16:01,050
Glam row,
a fellow Glam roadshow.

380
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:05,180
Why do I have an issue with the bright 
blue,

381
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,103
glittery lips?
The Literal Rainbow colored eye shadow 

382
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,560
with glitter,
the false

383
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,390
[inaudible] nine.
Is that what the.

384
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:15,420
Is this the Kashi?
Sixty nine.

385
00:16:15,421 --> 00:16:17,240
And I think the.
Here's my thing with this whole thing,

386
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,990
I don't give a fuck what you want to be.
Who you identify with.

387
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:24,350
I'm for real cool with all that shit.
I think this is like peacocking and it's

388
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:25,280
at is fine.
Is formed.

389
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:27,740
This is calling for attention.
So the reason that we all are like,

390
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,360
oh,
and when they get mad,

391
00:16:29,361 --> 00:16:30,620
like what are you looking at?
You know what someone's like,

392
00:16:30,621 --> 00:16:31,490
what are you looking at?
You like,

393
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:32,660
you,
you,

394
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:36,560
you fucking did this show for me to see 
otherwise you'd stay in private and have

395
00:16:36,561 --> 00:16:38,750
your own life,
but you want me to react.

396
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:39,803
But why do I like some of it?
Like if there's a seven year old black 

397
00:16:43,561 --> 00:16:46,710
dude and he's got like a red velvet suit
on.

398
00:16:46,711 --> 00:16:48,170
Well he looks cool as shit,
right?

399
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,193
With like a slick Dora and he's walking 
down the street with a fucking snake 

400
00:16:53,501 --> 00:16:55,050
heads.
Silver Cane.

401
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:57,120
Hey Joe Rogan.
You know what I'm saying?

402
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,640
I mean I look at that guy or girl,
look at this cool motherfucker,

403
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,500
but he's peacocking as well.

404
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:02,450
Yeah.
But it's a different this.

405
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:05,660
But this is attention grabbing because 
they want you to see,

406
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,420
okay,
these people are the people who do,

407
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,313
who want to be larger than life.
That do things like this to express who 

408
00:17:11,841 --> 00:17:12,674
they really are,
that they want to have a discussion 

409
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:16,820
whether or not they want to have true 
discourse.

410
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:19,580
They want you to go,
what is this?

411
00:17:19,581 --> 00:17:21,230
What are you,
what they want that.

412
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:22,163
Then they also want to like quote 
unquote inform you or argue with you 

413
00:17:25,371 --> 00:17:28,250
about who they are and what you said.
Identity.

414
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:28,730
Yeah,
but why?

415
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:30,280
That's my whole thing.
Why can't you just be.

416
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,183
Be The thing you want.
You don't need to have so many fucking 

417
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,460
with that nine labels from rocky,
gay,

418
00:17:34,461 --> 00:17:35,031
British,
Muslim.

419
00:17:35,031 --> 00:17:35,511
It's like,
dude,

420
00:17:35,511 --> 00:17:38,120
what you just your Glam Room agree with 
you.

421
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,000
Yeah.
Be Glamorous,

422
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,833
but I also myself,
I'm questioning my own judgemental 

423
00:17:43,591 --> 00:17:44,424
nature.
You saying why don't prejudge because I 

424
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:48,060
care because it's outside of the realm 
of normalcy.

425
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,013
It would've.

426
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,540
This is the,
this is.

427
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:54,090
These are pretty fucking normal foods 
from,

428
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:54,953
from jen,
from normal standards of what's kind of 

429
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:57,563
the same thing you've seen for the past.
So we fit into the culture where we 

430
00:18:00,991 --> 00:18:01,824
don't stand out.
So we're not asking for additional 

431
00:18:03,181 --> 00:18:04,014
attention.
I don't.

432
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:04,680
Yeah,
no.

433
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,700
Yeah.
This is,

434
00:18:05,701 --> 00:18:10,590
this is a call to attention to call to 
discussion and again,

435
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:11,603
I don't give a fuck.
I don't have anything against this 

436
00:18:12,631 --> 00:18:13,530
fucking person.
I don't know him.

437
00:18:13,531 --> 00:18:17,370
I don't give a shit about them.
I just know that this is clearly for you

438
00:18:17,371 --> 00:18:19,020
to go.
What the fuck?

439
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:20,640
That's why they.
That's why that is.

440
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:25,410
What if I was dressed exactly like this,
but a thick rope chain with a star on it

441
00:18:25,411 --> 00:18:28,230
that had all diamonds.
You want me to say something about it?

442
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,730
That's why you wore that,
right?

443
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,750
You'd want me to go.

444
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,520
Why the fuck?
Why are you wearing that shit?

445
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:34,343
Why the fuck are you wearing that?
And in fact it would be insane if I sat 

446
00:18:37,711 --> 00:18:39,450
here the whole fucking interview and 
didn't end.

447
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:42,690
Wasn't like it didn't go.
What the fuck is that star?

448
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:43,703
Like the size of like a Mercedes emblem 
diamond and you'd be the asshole if you 

449
00:18:47,371 --> 00:18:48,204
go,
Whoa,

450
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:48,990
whoa.
Oh,

451
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:49,823
what does this do I have to fucking do 
you have to know my identity with my 

452
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,570
part of my culture,
man.

453
00:18:54,571 --> 00:18:55,404
Okay,
well explain it because I don't get it 

454
00:18:56,311 --> 00:18:58,860
because it's not.
What I'm fucking used to or okay,

455
00:18:58,861 --> 00:19:01,710
how about a white guy who dresses like 
that,

456
00:19:01,711 --> 00:19:04,440
but he talks like he's not a white guy.
Right,

457
00:19:04,441 --> 00:19:04,771
right,
right.

458
00:19:04,771 --> 00:19:06,660
Like the whole,
well we'll do it.

459
00:19:06,661 --> 00:19:07,630
This guy.
Here's that.

460
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:11,400
He's a great troll.
He's actually so good at it.

461
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,040
Do you think he really got pistol 
whipped in Brooklyn and robbed,

462
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:14,460
or do you think?

463
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,090
No,
to him.

464
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:17,370
So I think that was all a big fucking 
media push,

465
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:20,130
but I think he's a genius for doing it 
because it got him way more attention.

466
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:24,060
I think rob,
but I think this kid is,

467
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,580
is actually very smart.
What do you say,

468
00:19:26,581 --> 00:19:27,600
Jamie?
You got to stuff back.

469
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,810
It took his chain and shit and they gave
you that.

470
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:35,880
Real thieves don't give shit back.
You get the chance.

471
00:19:35,881 --> 00:19:39,510
Go back sometimes.
What do you know about black culture?

472
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:43,020
Jamie's all pretend that was in the 
motherfucking streets.

473
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,440
Listen guys,
sometimes the chains come back.

474
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:47,663
Jamie's got it.
I'm not saying how they get them back 

475
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,350
for them back.
I'm on black twitter.

476
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:56,250
You guys don't know Jamie's like my 
black friend mark.

477
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:59,310
I went to the drake concert.
Relax,

478
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:03,420
I got this.
I bought the Carter Five Fella's.

479
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,313
Listen Up,
Jay Z and beyonce will no longer speak 

480
00:20:06,751 --> 00:20:09,090
to Kanye and Kim Kardashian.
In fact,

481
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:12,670
according to the fucking fake news.
No,

482
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:15,230
it was just out yesterday.
Yes.

483
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:16,203
Yeah.
Disavowed Kanye west and Kim Kardashian 

484
00:20:20,251 --> 00:20:22,920
because of his position on trump.
Jamie's got to Google it,

485
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:27,960
but Jamie fastest one handed type in the
fucking business.

486
00:20:27,961 --> 00:20:30,180
Look at that.
See it's over bitch.

487
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,890
Twenty two hours a guys motherfucker.
The Daily Mail sever ties.

488
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,380
It's in hot.
New Hip hop.com.

489
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:44,380
It's on an med.
What's nme and new media entertainment.

490
00:20:44,381 --> 00:20:47,470
Sever ties.
Sever ties.

491
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,230
Its over.
We severed ties,

492
00:20:50,231 --> 00:20:51,064
motherfucker.

493
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:52,043
We're not talking to you anymore.
You don't come to our champagne parties 

494
00:20:55,021 --> 00:20:58,740
over bitch because people were waiting 
for that album to watch the throne to.

495
00:20:58,741 --> 00:20:59,550
Yeah,
that's what it is.

496
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:02,280
It's just an album yet.
Collab album.

497
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,760
Yeah.
Well Jay Z is probably like,

498
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:05,670
I can't do it.
This crazy motherfucker anymore.

499
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:06,601
You have it.
You know what?

500
00:21:06,601 --> 00:21:07,434
This whole thing with Kanye and this 
whole push about getting Kaepernick to 

501
00:21:10,081 --> 00:21:12,230
have lunch with trump.
Brilliant.

502
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,373
It's fucking pr.
I think he used the whole platform of 

503
00:21:14,461 --> 00:21:18,270
snl just to get trump to go.
I love Kanye.

504
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:21,600
He wants trump to be so in love with 
Kanye,

505
00:21:21,601 --> 00:21:22,434
wants trump to love him so much that 
he's willing to actually take a meeting 

506
00:21:24,571 --> 00:21:27,840
with someone he's been publicly shitting
on for for a year now.

507
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:28,823
All trump has been doing a sand.
Kaepernick is a terrible representation 

508
00:21:31,471 --> 00:21:32,910
of this country,
a bad football player,

509
00:21:32,911 --> 00:21:33,750
a bad person.

510
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,270
He had been dumping,
dumping them and and then Kanye is going

511
00:21:36,271 --> 00:21:37,104
to sucker him in,
twist his mind into thinking he should 

512
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:42,360
actually sit and have lunch with them.
I bet my life that'll happen.

513
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,430
That trump will go,
okay,

514
00:21:44,431 --> 00:21:48,150
I'll take a meeting because I love Kanye
and it's just out of respect for Kanye.

515
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,260
So he'll get up.
He'll get him and fucking catherine.

516
00:21:51,261 --> 00:21:52,350
Nick in the room.
I'm,

517
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:53,620
I swear to God.
Watch it happen.

518
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:55,830
I hope he does,
but here's the thing.

519
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:56,693
Donald trump is not a cop and he's not 
shooting black people like the whole 

520
00:21:59,821 --> 00:22:02,590
thing is bizarre.
It makes no sense when

521
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:05,950
Kaepernick is on his knees during the 
national anthem.

522
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:06,813
That's bizarre too,
because people were just there for a 

523
00:22:08,951 --> 00:22:09,930
game.
It's a game.

524
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:15,030
I completely understand that.
You're disgusted by police brutality.

525
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:21,330
I think virtually everyone is.
My take on it is it's first of all,

526
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:26,140
it's insanely difficult to be a police 
officer.

527
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:27,063
You have a lot of people that are police
officers that have no business holding 

528
00:22:29,651 --> 00:22:31,750
that job.
They're under extreme pressure.

529
00:22:31,751 --> 00:22:34,870
A lot of them have ptsd and a lot of 
them,

530
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:39,130
they're bullies and they get into this 
position because they want to be the guy

531
00:22:39,131 --> 00:22:40,810
with the gun in charge.
Totally,

532
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:41,733
and then they have an opportunity to 
pull that trigger and they do and they 

533
00:22:44,411 --> 00:22:45,244
face repercussions because someone was 
filming it and I think that shit has 

534
00:22:47,921 --> 00:22:49,720
happened from the beginning of time.
Yeah,

535
00:22:49,721 --> 00:22:50,710
of course.
And there's film.

536
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,840
There's a horrible film that we played 
were.

537
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,850
There was a guy,
I posted it on my twitter.

538
00:22:54,851 --> 00:22:55,684
It's fucking horrible of a guy shooting 
a white guy who's crawling for his life 

539
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:01,930
on the voice telling the guy to crawl 
towards him.

540
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:05,470
Let me see your hands.
It's in Arizona and the guy's pants have

541
00:23:05,471 --> 00:23:07,600
fallen down.
It keeps reaching back to grab his pants

542
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,740
and he goes,
he goes,

543
00:23:08,741 --> 00:23:09,574
I will fucking shoot you if you grab 
your pants and the guy is crawling and 

544
00:23:13,361 --> 00:23:14,194
his pants are falling down.
He tries to grab his pants and the guy 

545
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:19,470
liked him up in the hallway of a hotel.
Yeah.

546
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:21,100
Fox just kills him,
fucked,

547
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:21,993
murdered him.
The guy was crying and begging for his 

548
00:23:24,161 --> 00:23:27,460
life and the cop was making crawl 
towards him like,

549
00:23:27,461 --> 00:23:30,100
why the fuck would you ever make someone
crawl towards you?

550
00:23:30,101 --> 00:23:34,750
It's insane and he's giving them all 
these confusing directions while he's in

551
00:23:34,751 --> 00:23:36,670
full riot gear holding a gun.

552
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,713
Apparently the guy had a fake pistol,
like a water pistol or a water gun and 

553
00:23:42,581 --> 00:23:43,414
was holding it out the window and 
someone saw it and they said there's a 

554
00:23:45,501 --> 00:23:47,060
guy with a gun.
So they came in,

555
00:23:47,061 --> 00:23:50,600
they're ready to shoot somebody already 
and then they see this guy,

556
00:23:50,601 --> 00:23:51,434
but the guy was clearly not threat.
We'll see this in this guy had already 

557
00:23:54,381 --> 00:23:55,214
been in trouble for other police 
brutality and then got kicked off the 

558
00:23:58,641 --> 00:24:00,350
force.
He got acquitted by the way,

559
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,360
with video,
got acquitted,

560
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:04,220
and then you've got acquitted of the 
murder?

561
00:24:04,221 --> 00:24:05,030
Yes,
acquitted.

562
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:07,460
He murdered this with the video with the
video,

563
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,473
got acquitted,
and then afterwards got kicked off the 

564
00:24:10,461 --> 00:24:11,930
force for something else.
He did.

565
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:17,030
So the guy was just an abusive guy and 
he was just going off.

566
00:24:17,031 --> 00:24:18,880
There's a lot of people like that.
Totally.

567
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:21,170
And there's also some that are racist 
too.

568
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,380
It's not discounting racism.
There's some that are racist too,

569
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,950
but it's just a fucking insanely 
difficult job.

570
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:28,893
But no one respects are very few people 
respect and these people are in these 

571
00:24:32,691 --> 00:24:33,524
situations every day where their life is
in danger and their whole brain is 

572
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:39,530
frazzled.
I'm friends with a lot of cops.

573
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:43,190
I know a lot of cops in my family.
I know a lot of cops from mma.

574
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,053
I know a lot.
I've known a lot of cops in my whole 

575
00:24:45,561 --> 00:24:48,110
life,
like my whole life growing up.

576
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:50,240
My,
my real dad was a cop.

577
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:51,163
I grew up like knowing cops when I was a
kid and then in an all through martial 

578
00:24:55,011 --> 00:24:56,030
arts,
new cops,

579
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,760
because cops are always taking martial 
arts to learn how to defend themselves.

580
00:24:58,761 --> 00:25:01,610
Right?
It's a fucking insane job,

581
00:25:01,611 --> 00:25:02,444
man.
That's crazy.

582
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:05,840
It's fucked up and every day,
all day long,

583
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,790
you're dealing with people that are 
committing crimes.

584
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:09,230
You're dealing with people that are 
lying.

585
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:10,790
You're dealing with people that are 
lying to you.

586
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:14,430
You pull people over there lying either 
drunk or on drugs.

587
00:25:14,431 --> 00:25:16,310
They've got a body in the trunk.
It's just lies.

588
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,990
Even a simple pullover is alive when it 
faster.

589
00:25:18,991 --> 00:25:19,780
We're going like,
no,

590
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:22,680
no.
Going over.

591
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:23,963
No.
I legitimately had a broken speedometer 

592
00:25:25,541 --> 00:25:28,480
once and a cop pulled me over and I go 
to the skin.

593
00:25:28,481 --> 00:25:30,390
It sounds so fucking stupid.
Must be nominated.

594
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,750
Doesn't work.
And he's like,

595
00:25:31,751 --> 00:25:33,340
get that shit fixed.
I go,

596
00:25:33,341 --> 00:25:34,111
yeah,
I should.

597
00:25:34,111 --> 00:25:36,600
I should let me go.
You know why I'm white,

598
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:38,110
white dude,
white guy.

599
00:25:38,111 --> 00:25:40,200
And it was only 18 at the time.
Black Dude.

600
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:41,123
He's like,
Bro.

601
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:45,980
And he's like,
get out of the car again.

602
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:47,620
It's,
you know,

603
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:50,530
it's not even something to joke about.
I'm sad that you just joked about it.

604
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,840
No,
but it is fucked up.

605
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,060
It's fucked up.
It is fucked up,

606
00:25:55,061 --> 00:25:56,260
man.
But here's the thing,

607
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:58,890
right?
Football players like capita,

608
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,810
people like that,
they need because they want to.

609
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,880
They using their platform.
I mean,

610
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:04,250
I get that to.
You should use your fuck.

611
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,350
Everyone should use their platform.

612
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:09,040
Here's my thing though.
Has that helped in any way?

613
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:09,581
Well,
no.

614
00:26:09,581 --> 00:26:11,220
See the problem is there's no.
There's no.

615
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,153
Okay.
The problem is if you said to 

616
00:26:12,551 --> 00:26:15,070
Kaepernick,
what's your end game to say,

617
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:17,410
stop all police violence is such a 
vague,

618
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,460
broad thing.
Does it go?

619
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:19,211
Yeah,
just stop it.

620
00:26:19,211 --> 00:26:20,350
It's like,
well that's not that.

621
00:26:20,351 --> 00:26:23,290
This is to have a dialogue about.
It was what's important,

622
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:25,760
but the problem is they need to have.
We need.

623
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,753
There needs to be a bigger goal for why 
people are kneeling because the 

624
00:26:28,901 --> 00:26:29,734
conversation has already been had.
It's not like we're kneeling so we can 

625
00:26:31,271 --> 00:26:33,260
talk about it,
what we're talking about it we need to.

626
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:35,800
There needs to be some kind of a,
an end game.

627
00:26:35,801 --> 00:26:37,290
A goal,
a point of that,

628
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,650
it's not,
I'm not saying it's achievable,

629
00:26:38,651 --> 00:26:41,440
it's not necessarily going to happen,
but you need,

630
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:44,060
you need something to to.
You

631
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:44,903
need something to get to because 
otherwise this is just going to be this 

632
00:26:46,861 --> 00:26:51,750
weird turmoil between ultimately racist 
people because truly the people that are

633
00:26:51,751 --> 00:26:54,000
yelling about it that are angry.
I don't give a fuck the take a knee.

634
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:55,860
Are they still gonna play football.
Why do you care?

635
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,700
Yeah.
Like I like,

636
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,533
but ultimately people that are like,
you better stand up better stand up for 

637
00:27:00,991 --> 00:27:02,120
America.
Again,

638
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:03,990
the ideas that we're all on the same 
team.

639
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,880
I know,
but there's no one to support the team,

640
00:27:05,881 --> 00:27:07,900
but why?
Why Neil dirt.

641
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:08,763
But why?
Then like because just because people 

642
00:27:10,501 --> 00:27:12,390
were paying attention.
That's exactly right because the all the

643
00:27:12,391 --> 00:27:13,224
eyeballs are on right?
But the idea about a nation about 

644
00:27:16,441 --> 00:27:17,274
everybody being on the team together.
So we're supposed to support these 

645
00:27:20,281 --> 00:27:25,230
ideals that this song is about.
I pledge of allegiance to the flag.

646
00:27:25,231 --> 00:27:25,960
All this jazz.

647
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,030
I mean that's what we're doing,
right?

648
00:27:27,031 --> 00:27:27,864
I know,
but I find it so odd that the things 

649
00:27:28,471 --> 00:27:29,304
have anything to do with one another.
I sat it on stage one time that I was 

650
00:27:30,991 --> 00:27:31,824
like,
it's a game that has no bearing on the 

651
00:27:33,841 --> 00:27:36,300
future of the United States of America.
You don't do that for anything else,

652
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:37,370
right?
You don't just.

653
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:39,810
You don't have like a dinner party and 
play monopoly and someone's like,

654
00:27:39,811 --> 00:27:41,440
we should say the pledge of allegiance.
Swamping.

655
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,293
The UFC stopped.
That I really liked was saying they 

656
00:27:44,701 --> 00:27:46,480
wouldn't do the fucking national anthem 
though.

657
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:48,120
What are we doing?
We're here for cage fights.

658
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:50,820
These are just two men competing in a 
sport,

659
00:27:50,821 --> 00:27:52,710
but it was a big thing with boxing and 
it still is.

660
00:27:52,711 --> 00:27:53,544
I think she's still do the national 
anthem before big boxing matches and 

661
00:27:56,761 --> 00:27:58,800
it's bold.
It's miserable.

662
00:27:58,890 --> 00:27:59,723
So you see people saying,
and it's when people do that thing with 

663
00:28:01,801 --> 00:28:06,300
their voice,
they tried to be.

664
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:07,420
They tried it,
they tried to make it

665
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,070
shaky thing.

666
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:22,620
Hey,

667
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:25,490
that's the funny thing at any sporting 
event in the middle of that,

668
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:29,300
up that last stretch,
there's always like 50,000

669
00:28:29,301 --> 00:28:30,134
people.

670
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,060
I think the crossover is so fucking 
silly.

671
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,700
We don't need to be singing about 
America at sporting events.

672
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:40,260
It doesn't have anything that doesn't 
have any.

673
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:44,340
The Olympics Olympics definitely.
That's what it's fucking about.

674
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,513
Controversy or country.
But during all this shit about the 

675
00:28:48,181 --> 00:28:49,230
Olympics,
I know,

676
00:28:49,231 --> 00:28:52,020
but I'm just saying I get that fucking 
national anthems at the Olympics.

677
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:52,854
That's what it is.
But this is just the packers versus 

678
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:55,913
fucking,
you know the buccaneers that this has 

679
00:28:57,721 --> 00:29:00,180
nothing to do with the bearing of 
American future.

680
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,860
Will the soldiers fought for your right 
to be able to put soldiers,

681
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,650
fought for your right to be able to do 
fucking everything can do.

682
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,360
Do we have to say it before this 
podcast?

683
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:07,750
Right?
Okay.

684
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,870
We should.
As a God damn flag behind me.

685
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:10,783
No God.
Damn American flare but secret not the 

686
00:29:13,321 --> 00:29:16,230
fans don't know that Joe hates the 
American flag on my phone.

687
00:29:16,231 --> 00:29:18,080
Bitch.
Goddamn American seed.

688
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:20,880
This motherfucker.
This is trolling.

689
00:29:20,881 --> 00:29:23,070
He's trolling.
Joe Is actually Canadian.

690
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:24,930
Nobody knows that.
Shows a Canadian.

691
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,513
She backed down Bro.
Conspiracy Rogan theorists online like 

692
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:33,390
is joe actually born in Canada doing 
Canadian propaganda on the sneak tip for

693
00:29:33,391 --> 00:29:36,450
years.
Toronto's a great city.

694
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,733
It's my favorite.
What I'm looking at you with that maker 

695
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:41,830
and I'm kidding.
No,

696
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:42,220
I'm loving

697
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,600
every second of it.
I was like,

698
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:47,080
this is like an ad for against sober 
October is my birthday on Tuesday.

699
00:29:47,081 --> 00:29:49,360
I'm not not drinking for.
Get it man.

700
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,690
Why should you?
Yeah.

701
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:52,120
What,
what did you think you'd be?

702
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,013
Do you think you would do sober October 
and like take a day off for your 

703
00:29:55,811 --> 00:29:58,660
birthday and then get back to sober and 
then.

704
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,040
Oh,
a day at the end of the month.

705
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:02,800
Start a day early.
I guess I could do it,

706
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:03,550
but I don't.
I don't.

707
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:05,350
I just died on Jamie.
What do you think?

708
00:30:05,351 --> 00:30:08,410
I can't do it.
You would do sober November.

709
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:10,000
What about silver?
February.

710
00:30:10,001 --> 00:30:11,860
It's only 28 days.
That's what's fucked up.

711
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,050
November history month.
That is the shortest.

712
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:17,440
The shortest month I said you said they 
gave him.

713
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:18,210
What if,
what if?

714
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:21,010
What if it was picked with the NAACP?
Picked it out.

715
00:30:21,011 --> 00:30:24,950
It just white whitey white people.
Being like this,

716
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,833
the shortest day crack ass fucking white
crusty looking billowing stinkin mother 

717
00:30:31,171 --> 00:30:32,004
fuckers.

718
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:35,230
I wish there was a good slur for 
breeders.

719
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:39,280
You know,
for straight people that like faggot.

720
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,050
Yes.
Something like a,

721
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:44,740
you know what I mean?
Wouldn't it be good for us?

722
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:48,070
It was a normal cigarette.
Use It on yourself.

723
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:50,530
Nor you fucking normal.
You fucking Goddamn.

724
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:55,250
Pretty easy to cast basic fucking 
breeding ass going out.

725
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:57,010
Penis in Vagina.
Dixie.

726
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:00,140
Pussies like fucking antiquated.
Loser.

727
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:02,103
Fucking arcane monkeys.
Stupid ass sperm soak in this 

728
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:10,210
motherfucker.
And inside a women you fucking loser.

729
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:13,150
What do you do?
People like yourself.

730
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:16,750
You fucking loser.
There should be a word.

731
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:17,883
Yeah,
I do think there wasn't an I put on my 

732
00:31:19,601 --> 00:31:23,200
instagram yesterday that uh,
you shouldn't say pregnant woman.

733
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:24,123
Oh,
you shouldn't assume that the gender of 

734
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:29,830
someone who's pregnant.
It was supposed to say to someone that's

735
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:31,020
people will like,
that's a troll,

736
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:31,870
right?
That's the onion.

737
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:32,470
No,
no,

738
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:33,520
no,
no,

739
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,090
no.

740
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:36,820
We are in the fucking twilight zone 
right now.

741
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:37,893
Here it is.
All genders can become pregnant because 

742
00:31:40,661 --> 00:31:43,480
people of all genders can have the 
reproductive organs to do.

743
00:31:43,481 --> 00:31:44,314
So.
What in the holy fuck it sentence 

744
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:48,243
instead of saying pregnant women try 
using the phrase pregnant people keep 

745
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:55,900
going down because people of all genders
can fall pregnant.

746
00:31:57,010 --> 00:32:01,370
You can fall pregnant.
Fuck falls prey.

747
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,420
I fell pregnant,
Joe.

748
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:06,280
I fallen pregnant because people of all 
genders can fall pregnant.

749
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:09,520
Can you call in if you're a man?
Can you call in work and say,

750
00:32:09,521 --> 00:32:10,354
Hey,
I'm not going to be in today because I 

751
00:32:11,351 --> 00:32:15,890
fell pregnant.
They do give a maternity leave for guys.

752
00:32:15,891 --> 00:32:16,900
Yeah.
Oh good.

753
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:18,550
Identify as pregnant.
Um,

754
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:19,200
I'm,
I,

755
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,560
I'm,
I've just fallen pregnant.

756
00:32:20,561 --> 00:32:22,050
I need to not come into work.
Yeah.

757
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:22,660
What,
how,

758
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:23,920
how has that work?
See,

759
00:32:23,921 --> 00:32:25,220
but this is what's this.
See,

760
00:32:25,221 --> 00:32:26,054
this is why this is a propaganda 
bullshit lie of like getting us all on 

761
00:32:28,841 --> 00:32:32,840
the same page of,
of not all genders can,

762
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,660
can have reproductive or.
And that's not true.

763
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:38,350
The reproductive organs,
it's really simple.

764
00:32:38,351 --> 00:32:40,490
You can't fabricate it is too

765
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:41,383
easy to survive.
So people are coming up with all sorts 

766
00:32:44,541 --> 00:32:47,780
of different kinds of conflicts that are
not real.

767
00:32:47,781 --> 00:32:50,570
I guarantee you all those people that 
are doing this,

768
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:53,330
they're not working out three hours a 
day fucking else they did.

769
00:32:53,331 --> 00:32:55,400
They wouldn't be paying any attention to
this shit.

770
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:59,570
It's like this is nonsense.
Instead of saying women are pregnant,

771
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:03,980
say instead of saying pregnant women,
try using the phrase pregnant people.

772
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:06,110
Oh well they corrected themselves.
The posts should say,

773
00:33:06,111 --> 00:33:07,610
become pregnant instead of fall 
pregnant.

774
00:33:07,611 --> 00:33:09,200
Thank you.
Are followership pointed this out?

775
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,510
You put it,
you wrote that yourself.

776
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:15,230
The language you use affects the people 
around you.

777
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:16,213
People of all genders can become 
pregnant because people of all genders 

778
00:33:19,071 --> 00:33:22,370
can have the reproductive organs do so 
when talking about pregnancy,

779
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:27,140
try to use the language that is 
inclusive of people of all genders.

780
00:33:27,141 --> 00:33:29,510
Well,
there's 78 different genders now.

781
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:31,910
Seventy nine Joe.
Don't be so fucking ignorant.

782
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,490
Dude.
I hate when I do that.

783
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:36,620
You know,
it's no ms dot gender.

784
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:40,040
This kind of bullshit is due to boredom.
This is complete boredom.

785
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,930
Well,
it's also weak pussies.

786
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:45,020
These people that are doing this,
I guarantee you if,

787
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,330
if this is where you're looking for 
conflict,

788
00:33:47,331 --> 00:33:48,164
yeah,
you're fucking whole life has fallen 

789
00:33:50,301 --> 00:33:51,650
apart.
You're a mess.

790
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:56,020
This idea that you're proposing that 
people of all.

791
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:58,010
First of all,
it's insulting to women.

792
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:02,900
It should be deeply insulting.
People of all genders can be pregnant.

793
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:03,823
The fuck they can.
You know how God damned difficult it is 

794
00:34:06,291 --> 00:34:09,800
for a woman.
Your wife hasn't been pregnant yet,

795
00:34:09,801 --> 00:34:10,790
but let me tell you something,
man.

796
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:13,670
I've seen a lot of women pregnant.
It's rough.

797
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:14,563
It's insanely hard.
Women get pregnant and it's hard for 

798
00:34:18,291 --> 00:34:18,810
them.
Yep.

799
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:21,020
That's what gets pregnant fucking 
difficult.

800
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:21,913
Their whole body goes through these 
crazy hormonal changes that gain a shit 

801
00:34:25,251 --> 00:34:26,600
ton of weight.
They get insecure,

802
00:34:26,601 --> 00:34:27,434
they have crazy mood swings,
chemicals in the brain changes 

803
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,850
postpartum depression where they get 
suicidal.

804
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:35,150
It happens in a lot of women.
The idea that all genders,

805
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:36,400
all genders.
No,

806
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:38,690
no bullshit.
Bullshit lies.

807
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,440
Biology motherfucker.
Fuck only.

808
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,460
Fuck the only.
There's only one.

809
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,270
There's only one gender that can become 
pregnant.

810
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:46,071
A woman.
Yes.

811
00:34:46,071 --> 00:34:47,660
That's a woman and that's the end of the
discussion,

812
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:48,553
but there's not an argument.
There's this new way of talking about 

813
00:34:52,521 --> 00:34:55,490
things that's filled with nonsense and 
they.

814
00:34:55,910 --> 00:35:00,910
This is where the fascism lies.
They want you to adhere to their rules.

815
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:02,630
Yeah.
One hundred percent,

816
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,890
and if they don't try to enforce this 
year,

817
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:08,420
they shame you.
Try to go after you fucking ask for what

818
00:35:08,421 --> 00:35:11,750
they are saying is literally against 
science.

819
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,630
It's not scientific.
It's not true.

820
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:15,583
Now,
if you want to tell me that some people 

821
00:35:17,271 --> 00:35:18,104
like to identify as a woman and you 
should talk to them as a woman and give 

822
00:35:21,201 --> 00:35:22,250
them a woman's name.
Sure,

823
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,600
totally.
I don't care that you think.

824
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:25,370
No problem.
If you want to listen,

825
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,170
that's my whole thing.
If you say to me,

826
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:28,400
I'm not a man,
I'm a woman.

827
00:35:28,401 --> 00:35:29,360
Now go good.
Good for you.

828
00:35:29,361 --> 00:35:32,060
That's fine.
I'm fine.

829
00:35:32,061 --> 00:35:33,650
I don't give a fuck what you.
That's fine,

830
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:38,070
but you can't stand there and tell me 
that anybody than a woman can

831
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:38,903
get pregnant.
Have a child at this is now we're 

832
00:35:40,381 --> 00:35:43,110
talking about like fake semantics.
This is phone.

833
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:43,973
That's phony.
Shit,

834
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:46,740
you've made that up.
It's also idiots.

835
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:50,220
It's all these weak people,
these weak minded.

836
00:35:50,221 --> 00:35:53,160
The way I described the lady who tried 
to bring a fucking emotional support.

837
00:35:53,161 --> 00:35:56,980
Squirrel on the airplane.
What airline was it by the spirit too.

838
00:35:57,010 --> 00:35:58,440
Oh,
I was hoping for around here.

839
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:00,810
Kanye talks.
Prison reform with trump.

840
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:01,840
Had lunch.
Okay,

841
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:03,660
play this.
Play this,

842
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:05,370
and please let's hear some volume here

843
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,550
and make more money.
That's one thing.

844
00:36:07,551 --> 00:36:08,384
I never stepped into a situation where I
didn't make people more money so we can 

845
00:36:11,901 --> 00:36:16,600
empower pharmaceuticals.
Nodding factory.

846
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,593
We can bring that.
Only Adidas on shore we could bring 

847
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:22,910
Foxconn is set up a factory and I think 
Minnesota.

848
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:25,490
Wisconsin.
Wisconsin.

849
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:26,650
Yeah,
Wisconsin.

850
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:29,403
I love Wisconsin dollars a year and one 
of the things we got to set is for to 

851
00:36:33,901 --> 00:36:35,930
have the highest design.
The dope.

852
00:36:35,931 --> 00:36:38,510
This car is the most amazing outer.
Don't say dope.

853
00:36:38,511 --> 00:36:40,200
I don't say negative words and to 
liquid,

854
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:42,080
we just say positive,
lovely,

855
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:44,250
divine universal stuff.

856
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:46,360
Getting stupid.
Jesus.

857
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,750
Listen,
you dumb mother fucker.

858
00:36:47,751 --> 00:36:49,840
Ford makes dope cars.
Okay.

859
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:52,700
Is he ever see a goddamned Mustang?
Gt?

860
00:36:52,701 --> 00:36:54,300
Three Rs.
That's a dope.

861
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,080
Jamie.
Post up a picture of a Mustang,

862
00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:01,430
Shelby Mustang gt.
Three slash 50 are quickly,

863
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:05,990
quickly all the tastes of that.
My fucking brain.

864
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:08,870
Give me a photo.
The new.

865
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:11,150
Oh God.
That's America right there.

866
00:37:11,151 --> 00:37:13,310
You're telling me that's not dope.
You son of a bitch.

867
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:16,320
Jesus there.
Top left.

868
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:17,560
Top one there.
Right there.

869
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:20,930
Hey,
come on son.

870
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:21,913
That's dope.
You know like I could drive that the 

871
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,000
raptor f 1:50
rapid.

872
00:37:25,001 --> 00:37:28,490
That thing is fun.
As far about drive the Ford Gt,

873
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:31,910
the one that John Scene has just sold 
for one point $3,000,000.

874
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:34,100
Pull up John.
Seen as for GT.

875
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,960
You don't think that's dope?
Well,

876
00:37:35,961 --> 00:37:36,794
I'm not talking to you anymore because 
our fucking conversations over now with 

877
00:37:39,951 --> 00:37:42,780
the doors up like doors,
Jamie.

878
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:47,790
That's what I'm looking at.
Fucking go big o.

879
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:49,940
If that's not dope,
Kanye.

880
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,410
I don't know.
What's the hope?

881
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:55,460
What are you going to teach the people 
at Ford had to design cars.

882
00:37:55,461 --> 00:37:57,830
Shut the fuck up and make your shitty 
slides.

883
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:58,903
Positive words vacuum your slides that 
are too short or were these God damn 

884
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:05,510
yeezys that Jamie bought for me and I 
will never wear show Joe.

885
00:38:05,511 --> 00:38:07,040
Joe's never seen that video with the 
little.

886
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:11,760
The little pump right the fucking fuck.
Now show him the picture of it.

887
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:14,090
Didn't bring it up.
Show him the picture.

888
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:15,290
Jamie.
Show him the picture.

889
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:18,470
Should go where the big suit.
He saw the box.

890
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,970
It's like they're wearing refrigerated 
box.

891
00:38:19,971 --> 00:38:20,541
This guy.
Okay,

892
00:38:20,541 --> 00:38:22,890
so I'm just saying this guy is trying to
tell us about via dopeys.

893
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:26,090
This is his music video.
That fucking car.

894
00:38:26,091 --> 00:38:26,924
You don't think that's dope?
That might be the dopest car the world 

895
00:38:29,301 --> 00:38:31,550
has ever known.
Slick as fuck.

896
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:32,893
Black for gt with red stripes.
This might be the most beautiful car 

897
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:38,770
I've ever.
It's okay.

898
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:42,880
Let me rephrase this most beautiful 
modern car I've ever seen.

899
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:46,190
It's a sexy fucking guys who was atj and
j.

900
00:38:46,191 --> 00:38:47,830
fucking thing,
man.

901
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:49,760
Look at that thing.
Good.

902
00:38:49,761 --> 00:38:50,980
Jay Go,
golly.

903
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,580
What a beast of a fucking automobile.
Kanye.

904
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:55,563
That is fucking cold as ice.
I think it was just saying to make them 

905
00:38:57,491 --> 00:38:59,950
here.
Shut up Jamie.

906
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:03,160
Goddammit,
you shut the fuck up.

907
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:11,940
Stupid Kanye West.
Give them a spelling bee first.

908
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,230
Give them a spelling bee and then you 
can say,

909
00:39:14,231 --> 00:39:15,064
listen,
if you can get here without using the 

910
00:39:21,311 --> 00:39:24,190
red squiggly line underneath you on your
phone.

911
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,370
Have you the fact that Donald's nodding 
at him,

912
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,713
I know he's sitting there going forward.
Should be doping probably sitting here 

913
00:39:34,691 --> 00:39:35,501
going,
fuck,

914
00:39:35,501 --> 00:39:37,720
did I get to this position where I'm in 
the Oval Office?

915
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:40,600
You know why?
Because he wanted to see Kim Kardashians

916
00:39:40,601 --> 00:39:41,500
so mad.
He was like,

917
00:39:41,501 --> 00:39:43,290
I'll let this motherfucker come back 
face.

918
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:45,730
Look at Donald's face.
Yes.

919
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:48,370
Imagine these photographers of like,
man,

920
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,980
I've taken.
They've been in such important rooms and

921
00:39:50,981 --> 00:39:52,000
they're like,
now I'm here.

922
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:53,013
But see the Kanye thing is like,
they just let them rant about shit and 

923
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:56,501
no,
no one goes,

924
00:39:56,501 --> 00:39:57,334
wait,
what?

925
00:39:57,690 --> 00:40:01,090
Like no needs to take his meds.
He's not taking his meds.

926
00:40:01,091 --> 00:40:02,560
He even said that he stopped taking 
meds.

927
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,610
Right?
Jamie's not the whole thing.

928
00:40:03,611 --> 00:40:04,220
It's like,
yeah,

929
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:05,390
take your meds,
Bro.

930
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:10,120
Beds made them gain a ton of weight and 
he looked really fucking spaced out.

931
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:11,430
Did you ever see fat?
Kanye,

932
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:14,410
Kanye was pulpit here with Kanye with 
the meds,

933
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:19,150
so what happened was after he gave his 
support for Donald Trump,

934
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:20,380
he said,
I didn't vote,

935
00:40:20,381 --> 00:40:22,510
but if I voted I would have voted on 
trump.

936
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,800
Like Lugoff Biggie.
Got they.

937
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:28,450
They loaded him up with pills and when 
they loaded him up with pills,

938
00:40:28,451 --> 00:40:30,910
you vanished for awhile.
Canceled his tour.

939
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:36,100
He was like having a fucking serious 
nervous breakdown and he got big fat.

940
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:37,480
That's usually.
That's when he.

941
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:39,720
That's when he was on the pills.
Oh yeah.

942
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,710
Mentally fucking stable.
No,

943
00:40:41,711 --> 00:40:42,544
I'd rather be fairly stable.
This is what I think because of sober 

944
00:40:45,071 --> 00:40:47,380
October.
I think he just needs to work out.

945
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:49,500
She was just going to say I don't,
I don't.

946
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:50,343
I don't think.
I don't think it's a part of his 

947
00:40:51,191 --> 00:40:52,870
lifestyle.
I think his lifestyle so.

948
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:55,300
Well that's not true because one of my 
friends was his trainer,

949
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:57,840
so he does work out.
You gotta train it for a walk.

950
00:40:57,841 --> 00:40:58,674
She,
I feel like he doesn't.

951
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,280
Yeah,
he seems like God that just doesn't have

952
00:41:00,281 --> 00:41:01,390
the.
He.

953
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,590
He had a trainer.
Yeah.

954
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:03,500
Trust me.
Yeah.

955
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:05,103
That's when he lost weight.
After all this bullshit is a long time 

956
00:41:06,461 --> 00:41:07,780
ago,
he had a trainer.

957
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:12,220
I want to say my friend was doing it 
unless he looks really good.

958
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:12,650
Good,
great.

959
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:14,590
Six or seven years ago.
Yeah.

960
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:15,760
Well,
you know,

961
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:19,150
I don't want to disclose any trainer 
client confidential shit,

962
00:41:19,151 --> 00:41:21,670
but working out.
He was working out,

963
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,560
but the point is,
look,

964
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:26,620
the guy's fucking obviously a little 
looney,

965
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:28,900
but that's also why he's so fucking 
creative.

966
00:41:28,901 --> 00:41:30,880
Fuck yeah.
I mean that's why his music so good.

967
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:31,890
I mean,
I.

968
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:34,640
I don't think you have to be completely 
normal.

969
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,950
Look,
most of my best friends are out of their

970
00:41:36,951 --> 00:41:39,440
fucking minds.
You're not fucking normal.

971
00:41:39,441 --> 00:41:41,390
I'm not knowing I got real problems.
Yeah.

972
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:42,710
All right.
Well we all do.

973
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:43,573
Anybody that's good at something,
but I also have a lot of self 

974
00:41:45,141 --> 00:41:46,910
examination and that's what he's 
lacking.

975
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:48,493
Self awareness.
I examined the things that I think and 

976
00:41:51,441 --> 00:41:55,070
say and how I interact with people and I
don't always get it right,

977
00:41:55,071 --> 00:41:55,904
but when I see him doing that holding 
court in front of the president of the 

978
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:00,463
United States with a mag maggot hat on,
like in front of all these fucking 

979
00:42:02,571 --> 00:42:03,404
people,
taking pictures of him like this is 

980
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:05,023
preposterous.
I don't use words like dope because I 

981
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,990
try to use only positive,
like lovely.

982
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:11,690
Dope is positive.
It's dope.

983
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:13,640
Like you.
You sent me a text and I sent you texts.

984
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,540
Let's do 10:00
AM.

985
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:15,140
Dope,
dope,

986
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:15,800
dope.
Great.

987
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,610
Perfect.
Plus,

988
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:19,070
great lesson.
It's not negative.

989
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:20,870
Next time you texted me,
I'm going to go divine.

990
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:21,853
Yeah,
if I can.

991
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:23,030
When I saw your car,
I was like,

992
00:42:23,031 --> 00:42:24,080
dude,
that's a dope car.

993
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:25,250
It's divine Joe.
Oh,

994
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:26,750
it's lovely.
It's lovely.

995
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:29,290
It's wonderful.
It's wonderful.

996
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:30,133
Wonderful.
Few Times in all honesty and I always 

997
00:42:31,431 --> 00:42:32,520
feel like,
well,

998
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,490
you sound like a bitch a little bit,
a little bit.

999
00:42:34,610 --> 00:42:35,710
Hey,
how was your.

1000
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:38,010
How was that thing you did yesterday?
It was wonderful.

1001
00:42:38,011 --> 00:42:38,630
Oh,
okay.

1002
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:40,420
It was wonderful.
It just swallow Cox.

1003
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:44,900
It's one of those words that you use 
when you're hanging around with actors.

1004
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,780
He was wonderful.
He was a wonderful,

1005
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:48,643
wonderful performance.
Especially when you're talking about a 

1006
00:42:49,641 --> 00:42:51,830
woman.
She was exquisite.

1007
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:54,440
Wonderful.
Her performance was so wonderful.

1008
00:42:54,441 --> 00:42:55,380
You know the word that I hate.

1009
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:57,270
Brilliant,
supportive woman.

1010
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,113
I hate brilliant.
And the actor community people say 

1011
00:42:59,351 --> 00:43:01,210
brilliant bothers me.
So when they go,

1012
00:43:01,211 --> 00:43:02,430
oh my God,
just brilliant.

1013
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:04,390
You're like,
unless it's brilliant.

1014
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:06,220
Yeah,
but the rarity of that word should.

1015
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:09,700
It should be so it would be used so 
less,

1016
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:11,950
but you go see Roger Waters at the 
Hollywood bowl and like,

1017
00:43:11,951 --> 00:43:13,360
fuck.
It was brilliant.

1018
00:43:13,361 --> 00:43:15,190
Big Difference.
That's of course,

1019
00:43:15,191 --> 00:43:16,930
that's an issue.
That is brilliant,

1020
00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:18,243
but that's.
That's decades of hard work and talent 

1021
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:22,060
and so many things coming together to 
make.

1022
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,160
I've watched him do the wall here,
what?

1023
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:29,190
Three years ago at Staples Center and 
and I was sober rish.

1024
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:32,800
Let's just say that I was so British.
I was microdosing and it was sobering.

1025
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:34,980
Yeah,
it was.

1026
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:37,690
I wasn't like lit up,
but I was in a good space.

1027
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:41,170
It was maybe one of the most incredible 
visual things.

1028
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,033
Visual concerts.
I've ever seen in my fucking life to 

1029
00:43:43,541 --> 00:43:44,110
watch them.

1030
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:44,943
You ever seen that?
They build the wall on stage as he's 

1031
00:43:46,721 --> 00:43:49,060
performing and they tear it down in the 
middle of it all.

1032
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:50,980
Damn.
It was fucking.

1033
00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:51,843
It was visually one of the most stunning
concerts I've ever been a part of to 

1034
00:43:55,091 --> 00:43:57,700
watch them make.
It's not just a band playing.

1035
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,830
It was them making visual art while he 
was telling this story through music and

1036
00:44:02,831 --> 00:44:05,560
I was like,
this is why I'll pay hundreds of dollars

1037
00:44:05,561 --> 00:44:07,120
to watch somebody.
Not,

1038
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:08,253
not just to hear fucking Tom Petty Way.
Allow those tickets are the same amount 

1039
00:44:12,131 --> 00:44:12,964
of money,
but you don't get the show like with 

1040
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:14,503
waters,
you get like this fucking visual 

1041
00:44:16,091 --> 00:44:16,924
experience.

1042
00:44:17,850 --> 00:44:19,470
He's incredible man.
Yeah.

1043
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:23,100
He's incredible.
Anti trump shit at his concerts to right

1044
00:44:23,101 --> 00:44:23,950
with pig heads

1045
00:44:23,990 --> 00:44:25,990
and she had a lot of government,
a lot of government shit.

1046
00:44:25,991 --> 00:44:27,310
Yeah.
He gets into a lot of that bullshit,

1047
00:44:27,311 --> 00:44:28,080
but I mean it's,
it's,

1048
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:30,010
it's visually stunning as fees.
Nuts.

1049
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:31,610
Yeah.
Nuts.

1050
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:32,010
Because

1051
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:32,843
he's.
So.

1052
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:35,070
That's what I was saying.
He's so good.

1053
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:36,570
He's beautifully insane.
Crazy.

1054
00:44:36,571 --> 00:44:37,404
Yes.
All these airplanes flying overhead and 

1055
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:40,403
then they float.
Yet they flowed big pigs over you that 

1056
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:45,570
drop propaganda notes and shit.
Dope as fuck.

1057
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:47,610
Dope.
It's dope.

1058
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:49,110
It's dope.
It's fucking incredible.

1059
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:51,090
Yeah,
but I mean that's what I'm saying.

1060
00:44:51,091 --> 00:44:54,210
Visually.
It's fucking just unbelievably beautiful

1061
00:44:54,211 --> 00:44:55,950
man.
So is the Jamie,

1062
00:44:55,951 --> 00:44:56,761
you're.
You're a part of black.

1063
00:44:56,761 --> 00:44:57,594
Twitter is the black community 
abandoning Kanye and there are only 

1064
00:45:00,061 --> 00:45:02,880
white people accepting him now.
That's Jamie.

1065
00:45:02,881 --> 00:45:04,540
You're black.
If I see a lot of the all,

1066
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:06,320
all white people.
Alright.

1067
00:45:06,321 --> 00:45:07,270
Excuse me.
Alright,

1068
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:09,433
can you say all white?
I don't think Jamie's Jamie's part of 

1069
00:45:11,911 --> 00:45:13,500
the black.
Oh wait,

1070
00:45:13,501 --> 00:45:15,480
let's define it right now.
What's out white?

1071
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:16,770
What would you call all?
White.

1072
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:21,540
All white would be.
I'm not all right yet.

1073
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:25,860
They're not there yet.
All white is all the batter's box.

1074
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:26,950
Yeah.
They're like on their way.

1075
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:28,673
The next step.

1076
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:33,470
What's all white?
What would you call out?

1077
00:45:33,471 --> 00:45:34,290
White.
Who like,

1078
00:45:34,290 --> 00:45:36,360
give me an example of a person who is 
all white.

1079
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:39,930
It was whiter.
Here's one.

1080
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:43,650
Here's one.
I'm the fucking Dilbert guy.

1081
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:45,450
Scott Adams.
She's all white.

1082
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,340
Who's that?
Because he's not all right,

1083
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:49,890
right.
He's a really brilliant guy,

1084
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,520
but he's like Sorta,
oh the comic seniors,

1085
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:53,310
like,
yeah,

1086
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:55,260
seems like he had and I liked the guy a 
lot,

1087
00:45:55,261 --> 00:45:56,094
but it seems like he had these ideas 
about trump and now he's always just 

1088
00:45:59,221 --> 00:46:00,054
trying to defend them with some sort of 
circular logic and weird phrasing and 

1089
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:04,733
he's a super smart guy,
but he never said a single negative 

1090
00:46:07,051 --> 00:46:08,040
thing about trump.
It's always,

1091
00:46:08,041 --> 00:46:08,874
well it was a brilliant negotiator and 
what he's doing is so strategy and he's 

1092
00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:13,560
very persuasive and I'm like,
yeah,

1093
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:14,483
is he,
is that what's going on or is he just 

1094
00:46:15,901 --> 00:46:18,780
like flying by the seat of his pants 
because he's a fucking maniac.

1095
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:19,613
And Are you just trying to sort of 
justify all the other shit that you've 

1096
00:46:23,821 --> 00:46:24,840
said about it?
And that's really good.

1097
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:26,620
That's what they do because that's what 
it seems like to me.

1098
00:46:27,010 --> 00:46:28,710
People don't like Scott Adams.
Yeah,

1099
00:46:28,830 --> 00:46:29,530
a lot.
Yeah,

1100
00:46:29,530 --> 00:46:31,260
I like it.
I just think he's a very nice guy.

1101
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:32,730
He's all white,
all white.

1102
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,530
He,
they dance on this line that's like,

1103
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:37,740
listen,
not offensive over my house.

1104
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:40,440
Now they just have dinner with him.
He's more youthful guy,

1105
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:41,303
he's he.
He's more into those positions that he 

1106
00:46:44,911 --> 00:46:47,860
wants to probably admit,
but from a surface level he's like,

1107
00:46:47,870 --> 00:46:48,420
no,
no.

1108
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:52,320
Like what positions?
Doggystyle style.

1109
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:53,290
Alt right.
None.

1110
00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:54,240
No mission.
What's an ot?

1111
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:55,083
What,
how do you think all white people fuck 

1112
00:46:56,790 --> 00:46:57,481
that?
Don't fuck.

1113
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,460
They stand up in the shower.
They,

1114
00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:03,390
they,
they do this the whole time.

1115
00:47:03,391 --> 00:47:04,224
They fuck if you do that.
If you fuck with one hand up like 

1116
00:47:06,541 --> 00:47:07,374
Hitler,
but that hand is touching the glass in 

1117
00:47:08,821 --> 00:47:11,610
the shower.
Then it's all white.

1118
00:47:11,611 --> 00:47:14,590
Fucking.
This is all white fucking business.

1119
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:21,000
I think there's a lot of all whites out 
there.

1120
00:47:21,001 --> 00:47:21,834
Let's,
let's figure out who was all white 

1121
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:24,893
white.
Who's my best example of a white person 

1122
00:47:26,281 --> 00:47:27,114
that I know.
That's okay.

1123
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:28,830
Like one of them,
one of them hot.

1124
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,070
It's always talking about

1125
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:33,730
white people issues is Tomi Lahren alt.
Oh yeah,

1126
00:47:33,731 --> 00:47:34,750
she's old white.
Yeah.

1127
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,340
All White.
Not all right.

1128
00:47:36,341 --> 00:47:37,174
But all white because you know what's so
clever about that fucking chick that 

1129
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:40,413
she.
She did an interview with that Trevor 

1130
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:42,460
Noah kid on,
um,

1131
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:44,403
what the daily show.
And then afterwards they hung out and 

1132
00:47:46,271 --> 00:47:47,104
the Paparazzi,
I picture them smiling and hugging and 

1133
00:47:48,281 --> 00:47:48,911
all shit,
you know,

1134
00:47:48,911 --> 00:47:50,740
in the street says Hollywood is fake as 
fuck.

1135
00:47:50,741 --> 00:47:53,860
Like she does this game,
but it's like she's not fucking racist.

1136
00:47:53,861 --> 00:47:56,890
She doesn't hate people of color.
She likes to be evocative,

1137
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:57,753
provocative.
She likes to take a conservative 

1138
00:47:58,721 --> 00:47:59,554
stances.
Well that's what they say about Ann 

1139
00:48:00,970 --> 00:48:02,680
Coulter,
that if you'd talked to Ann Coulter,

1140
00:48:02,681 --> 00:48:04,990
she's actually a lovely person.
Will look at it like this.

1141
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:06,460
There's a map.
You can bring it up.

1142
00:48:06,490 --> 00:48:07,323
Jamie.
Jamie,

1143
00:48:07,350 --> 00:48:09,440
bring it up.
There's a map of a PR.

1144
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:10,313
I'm a categorical porn percentages in 
the United States and the highest 

1145
00:48:13,751 --> 00:48:16,300
percentage of white and black porn is in
the south.

1146
00:48:16,450 --> 00:48:18,540
Like the Bible belt of a bit about it.
You did.

1147
00:48:18,550 --> 00:48:19,383
But it had to stop doing it because it 
was going to drop the n bomb a bunch of 

1148
00:48:22,031 --> 00:48:22,864
times on a bit.

1149
00:48:25,290 --> 00:48:27,080
I can see how that didn't go over as 
well though.

1150
00:48:27,090 --> 00:48:28,810
It worked.
It worked or it didn't.

1151
00:48:28,811 --> 00:48:32,380
Yeah.
Or either crushed or it was dangerous.

1152
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:36,160
Or after the show joe had to sneak out 
fast.

1153
00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:37,560
I know that there was,
there was,

1154
00:48:37,570 --> 00:48:38,403
it was like in the Bible belt,
there is a chunk of the highest amount 

1155
00:48:40,781 --> 00:48:41,614
of black dudes fucking white,
like black on white porn is in the most 

1156
00:48:44,231 --> 00:48:45,640
conservative parts of the country.
Well,

1157
00:48:45,641 --> 00:48:46,474
my,
my take on it was that it wasn't black 

1158
00:48:47,981 --> 00:48:49,360
guys there.
We're watching this.

1159
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:51,670
Of course I know it's fucking white 
dudes that are,

1160
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:53,740
that wish their rights.
Angry fucking,

1161
00:48:53,741 --> 00:48:56,620
but I don't want some big white.
You put it in her ass.

1162
00:48:56,621 --> 00:49:01,390
You put that big beautiful thin skin.
Veiny black penis in my wife.

1163
00:49:01,391 --> 00:49:06,160
That chocolate dark snake stick and my 
wife.

1164
00:49:08,770 --> 00:49:09,603
That's all it is.
It's all this fuckin like racial 

1165
00:49:10,661 --> 00:49:11,494
suppression.
That's those people that like that play 

1166
00:49:15,021 --> 00:49:16,420
the game.
That's all white.

1167
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:17,980
They're not.
They're not all the way,

1168
00:49:17,981 --> 00:49:19,180
but they're.
There you go.

1169
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:22,370
Most searched for terms the United 
States Lesbian,

1170

Texas is all lesbian,
California,

lesbian.
That's hilarious.

1172
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:29,080
Stepsister.
On a second stop.

1173
00:49:29,410 --> 00:49:34,410
Look at this scan back in again so I 
could see the actual title of this.

1174
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,340
The most searched for terms in the 
United States.

1175

Michigan.

1177
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:45,850
What are those dates?
I don't know that.

1178
00:49:45,851 --> 00:49:47,680
Okay.
Stepsister is Minnesota,

1179
00:49:47,770 --> 00:49:48,340
right?
That's.

1180
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:50,620
That's Minnesota.
What is the other two?

1181
00:49:50,621 --> 00:49:54,450
That it goes north and South Dakota was 
lesbian and stepping on Wyoming.

1182
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:55,510
No,
no,

1183
00:49:55,510 --> 00:49:58,150
that one's Wyoming guys.
That's Wyoming and Montana.

1184
00:49:58,210 --> 00:50:01,240
Wyoming is the square and that's the 
only one that's pr.

1185
00:50:01,330 --> 00:50:02,860
There's two states that are perfectly 
square.

1186
00:50:02,861 --> 00:50:03,694
How they pull that off color.
Colorado's perfectly square and so is 

1187
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:07,860
Wyoming.
Yeah.

1188
00:50:07,870 --> 00:50:09,610
That's amazing.
Yeah,

1189
00:50:09,611 --> 00:50:11,980
New Mexico almost had it.
That's crazy.

1190
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:15,850
Like how jealous muscle.
Massachusetts Bay with goofy ass shit.

1191
00:50:15,950 --> 00:50:17,200
You fuck them.
Fuck everybody.

1192
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:19,173
Fuck on that road.
I live in Florida is built like a Dick 

1193
00:50:21,221 --> 00:50:24,460
and they got to look at Colorado.
Colorado is like a perfect square.

1194
00:50:24,490 --> 00:50:26,530
Florida's the dingleberry of the United 
States.

1195
00:50:26,630 --> 00:50:28,070
Texas.
Just chaos.

1196
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:29,930
Texas is just.
We are.

1197
00:50:29,931 --> 00:50:31,100
Whatever the fuck we are.

1198
00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:34,550
We're a boot wear.
Whatever the fuck.

1199
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:38,060
So Louisiana is.
Okay.

1200
00:50:38,110 --> 00:50:39,260
So.
So I'll like.

1201
00:50:39,261 --> 00:50:42,710
One state is black.
He states that Ebony,

1202
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:44,300
what does it?
Louisiana,

1203
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:47,300
Louisiana.
Black Alaska stepmom.

1204
00:50:47,330 --> 00:50:48,163
George's black.
White isn't the map that I was thinking 

1205
00:50:50,871 --> 00:50:51,704
of though.
There is another one where it was like 

1206
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:54,950
that.
It said black on white point.

1207
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:56,780
How recent is this?
Don't go.

1208
00:50:56,781 --> 00:50:58,130
Don't go away.
Go back.

1209
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:01,160
Go googling for yourself,
motherfucker.

1210
00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:03,610
Stop.
Look at MILF.

1211
00:51:04,190 --> 00:51:06,650
Where's MILF?
One state like Rhode Island.

1212
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:07,521
Oh,
it is Rhode Island.

1213
00:51:07,521 --> 00:51:09,410
Scroll back there.
Keep it right there.

1214
00:51:09,411 --> 00:51:10,071
Don't move.
Oh,

1215
00:51:10,071 --> 00:51:11,890
that is Rhode Island.
Look at MILF.

1216
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:13,760
Stepsister is Maine.
Maine.

1217
00:51:13,761 --> 00:51:14,900
Got that step sister.
Shit.

1218
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:16,640
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1219
00:51:16,641 --> 00:51:17,390
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1220
00:51:17,390 --> 00:51:20,720
New Hampshire's cartoon.
Not The fuck.

1221
00:51:20,721 --> 00:51:24,330
What the fuck?
Three cartoon states for four.

1222
00:51:24,410 --> 00:51:25,243
Well,
that's Arkansas and Tennessee are 

1223
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:28,310
cartoon to.
Those are the two states.

1224
00:51:28,310 --> 00:51:29,960
They're 10.
It's like one state,

1225
00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:33,400
but this also gives me a little bit of 
hope because Joe,

1226
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:36,290
you've.
You've come from Massachusetts was still

1227
00:51:36,291 --> 00:51:38,840
lesbian and now you're still lesbian in 
Chicago.

1228
00:51:38,841 --> 00:51:40,070
We were always lesbian.
I'm still,

1229
00:51:40,071 --> 00:51:43,300
I feel really good about my consistency 
of my pornography state category.

1230
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:46,670
How many are searching for lesbians more
than anything?

1231
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:50,860
And look at Alaska step.
Mom was babysitting me.

1232
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:54,910
Wilma.
Why the age?

1233
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:56,250
Literally.
How about Ebony?

1234
00:51:56,270 --> 00:51:58,220
So only one state,
all three states.

1235
00:51:58,310 --> 00:51:58,960
Now one,
two,

1236
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:03,700
three.
I like that term to ebony had been ebony

1237
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:04,940
want to say black?
That's funny.

1238
00:52:04,941 --> 00:52:05,774
People type in black and they type in 
evidence the only type in black and one 

1239
00:52:08,271 --> 00:52:09,740
state because they don't know what 
equity means down.

1240
00:52:09,741 --> 00:52:10,310
Okay,
Joe,

1241
00:52:10,310 --> 00:52:12,260
this is proving what we're saying is 
well proven.

1242
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:13,440
We're saying,
you know,

1243
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:16,220
who's searching for ebony in Georgia and
in.

1244
00:52:17,390 --> 00:52:19,430
What is that?
And stop moving this.

1245
00:52:19,610 --> 00:52:20,930
Go Zoom in.
Zoom in.

1246
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:22,663
This is a fundamental difference.
So Ebony down there in Georgia and in 

1247
00:52:27,081 --> 00:52:28,570
um,
uh,

1248
00:52:28,850 --> 00:52:30,920
what is that Mr Shippee,
right?

1249
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:31,813
Yeah.
The reason that those are ebony and 

1250
00:52:32,870 --> 00:52:36,050
Louisiana's black is because ebony is 
searched by black people,

1251
00:52:36,110 --> 00:52:39,200
black and searched by white people.
That's for sure.

1252
00:52:39,201 --> 00:52:41,030
One hundred percent.
Now you're right.

1253
00:52:41,050 --> 00:52:41,883
That's categorically ebony is a black 
person typing black is a bunch of white 

1254
00:52:44,631 --> 00:52:46,880
dudes being like Gimme a black porn,
right?

1255
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,510
Chocolate,
big old chocolate.

1256
00:52:48,770 --> 00:52:50,720
Other Ebony up uptop.
Jamie,

1257
00:52:50,721 --> 00:52:52,420
what is the other ebony on the right 
side?

1258
00:52:52,430 --> 00:52:55,010
What state is that?
Delaware.

1259
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,270
I forgot.
Delaware is a state.

1260
00:52:56,630 --> 00:52:59,000
That's one of the mistakes you like.
That's a state.

1261
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:00,380
How do we make,
how do we still.

1262
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:02,330
They can't just get absorbed by another 
state.

1263
00:53:02,810 --> 00:53:05,030
What is surrounding Delaware?
What's next to Delaware?

1264
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:06,290
Maryland.
That's right.

1265
00:53:06,310 --> 00:53:07,143
Yeah.
Fucking forget about Maryland's all 

1266
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:10,040
about the lesbians,
so wait a minute.

1267
00:53:10,041 --> 00:53:11,600
They're ebony haunt.
That's so strange.

1268
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:12,563
To go back to the scroll,
go back to the side so that it was 

1269
00:53:15,141 --> 00:53:17,810
before was we read it all myself is only
one state.

1270
00:53:17,811 --> 00:53:20,000
That's weird.
That is Rhode Island,

1271
00:53:20,001 --> 00:53:20,960
right?
Yeah.

1272
00:53:21,050 --> 00:53:23,630
That little tiny ass bitch ass bitch ass
state.

1273
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:25,680
How many Rhode Islands are in Texas?
Look at that.

1274
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:26,070
There's

1275
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:29,190
dudes who own a Rhode Island in Texas.
They own multiple.

1276
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:33,480
One hundred percent.
Do you know there's like 8,000

1277
00:53:33,481 --> 00:53:36,720
ranches or something like that in Texas?
8,000.

1278
00:53:36,810 --> 00:53:38,720
Yeah.
Thousands of ranches.

1279
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:42,570
That's fucking branches.
May there might be more,

1280
00:53:42,571 --> 00:53:43,404
because I was watching this on 
television show and I think it was an 

1281
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:49,200
older television show number of ranches 
in Texas.

1282
00:53:50,850 --> 00:53:53,040
Two hundred 48,000
ranchers.

1283
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:58,100
Ranch is 248,000
farms and ranches covering 132.

1284
00:53:59,270 --> 00:54:00,780
One hundred $30.
Million acres.

1285
00:54:01,110 --> 00:54:04,050
Two hundred and 48,000
farms and rent.

1286
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:06,990
Look at the Tivoli.
The commodities is all cows,

1287
00:54:06,991 --> 00:54:08,630
baby.
How do you define the difference between

1288
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:12,090
farm and ranch?
That's actually extremely interesting.

1289
00:54:12,130 --> 00:54:13,920
I've always thought that it'd be the 
same thing,

1290
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:15,840
isn't.
No rancher isn't a ranch or farm.

1291
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:19,320
I guess I'll go back up again.
Please stop scrolling.

1292
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:23,940
Two hundred 48,000
farms and ranches covering a hundred and

1293
00:54:23,941 --> 00:54:27,930
30 point 2 million acres.
Next is the biggest fucking.

1294
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:29,393
Texas has more women and minority farm 
operators in any other state in the 

1295
00:54:32,521 --> 00:54:33,530
nation.
Texas.

1296
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:36,030
Powerful Texas with diversity.
I love that.

1297
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:38,130
Go down for one second real quick.
Just a little bit.

1298
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:39,173
There's the thing that said America's 
biggest ranch goes on sale for 725 

1299
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:42,890
million.
Seven.

1300
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:43,913
Click on them.
See how many fucking what is that 

1301
00:54:45,631 --> 00:54:49,260
fucking place?
Ten thousand acres of land.

1302
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:50,910
One hundred.
Ten thousand.

1303
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:53,580
One hundred and 10,000.
Five hundred and 10,000

1304
00:54:53,581 --> 00:54:56,310
acres of bug me.
Seventy 500 cows.

1305
00:54:57,030 --> 00:55:00,400
Look at the size of that fucking place.
Five hundred,

1306
00:55:00,510 --> 00:55:01,980
10,000
acres.

1307
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:03,900
This is the kind of money that makes fun
of Jay z.

1308
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:04,733
You know,
like in America were like Jay z's rich 

1309
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:08,160
are these fucking people are rich.
This is,

1310
00:55:08,190 --> 00:55:10,200
this is wealth,
this is pure wealth.

1311
00:55:10,201 --> 00:55:11,034
A scroll back up to that building.
That's a look at that old school stone 

1312
00:55:13,651 --> 00:55:15,600
building on the property.
Know there's,

1313
00:55:15,601 --> 00:55:16,260
um,
I,

1314
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:17,093
I have a friend who was in at a ranch in
Texas and they found petroglyphs in a 

1315
00:55:20,251 --> 00:55:21,084
cave.

1316
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:22,410
What?
Yeah.

1317
00:55:22,411 --> 00:55:25,950
Petroglyphs.
Like ancient native American petroglyphs

1318
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:28,170
of an unknown origin.
They don't know who did.

1319
00:55:28,410 --> 00:55:29,730
And I was like,
well,

1320
00:55:29,731 --> 00:55:32,520
don't they have historians come here and
wrote that off like the.

1321
00:55:32,570 --> 00:55:34,440
They got a lot of it here.
It's all over the place.

1322
00:55:34,441 --> 00:55:35,610
They don't even pay attention to it.
I was like,

1323
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:38,070
what are you talking about?
They just don't.

1324
00:55:38,071 --> 00:55:40,230
They don't bother with it.
Ancient Petroglyphs.

1325
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:43,500
Click on the upper left hand corner.
The one that you just had Mexico.

1326
00:55:43,950 --> 00:55:45,290
Is that New Mexico?
Yeah,

1327
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:46,920
they have them all over.
It's all over.

1328
00:55:46,921 --> 00:55:47,820
Yeah.
So Arizona,

1329
00:55:47,821 --> 00:55:48,750
New Mexico,
Texas,

1330
00:55:48,751 --> 00:55:49,860
everywhere that.
The thing is,

1331
00:55:49,861 --> 00:55:52,620
no one's like curating them.
No one's taking care of them.

1332
00:55:52,621 --> 00:55:55,890
They just exist on this ranch.
And the ranch was a,

1333
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,290
was a hunting ranch.
That's awesome.

1334
00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:00,030
They took pictures of him.
Where is that?

1335
00:56:00,031 --> 00:56:02,400
Jamie?
That's fucking amazing.

1336
00:56:02,430 --> 00:56:03,930
My friend.
Steven Rinella.

1337
00:56:03,930 --> 00:56:08,130
Who's new show mediator is now only on 
Netflix.

1338
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:09,880
It's a hunting show.
It's on Netflix.

1339
00:56:09,881 --> 00:56:14,340
Like an intelligent,
really well narrated hunting show.

1340
00:56:14,341 --> 00:56:15,090
That's,
that's,

1341
00:56:15,090 --> 00:56:17,850
that's done.
And produced by a brilliant guy.

1342
00:56:17,851 --> 00:56:20,910
My friend Steven Rinella.
But he was in Guyana,

1343
00:56:20,970 --> 00:56:21,803
which was where Jonestown was,
where he fucking killed all those 

1344
00:56:26,081 --> 00:56:27,390
people.
Jones Koolaid.

1345
00:56:27,410 --> 00:56:28,520
Yeah.
And uh,

1346
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:31,900
they found these petroglyphs on a rock 
and they were like,

1347
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:34,390
who?
Who made these like no one has any idea.

1348
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:36,880
It's like right by this waterfall.
No one has any idea.

1349
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,070
It's a fascinating series.
He's in Guyana,

1350
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:40,983
living with these indigenous people and 
fishing in these rivers for like three 

1351
00:56:43,931 --> 00:56:46,650
days.
And just they,

1352
00:56:46,651 --> 00:56:51,070
they just live and it's three,
it's three episodes and they camp out by

1353
00:56:51,071 --> 00:56:51,904
this river and use these traditional 
methods of hunting that these people 

1354
00:56:55,241 --> 00:56:57,640
have used for thousands and thousands of
years.

1355
00:56:57,820 --> 00:57:01,360
But now they're wearing like,
like under armour tee shirts.

1356
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:03,460
Shit,
they're still barefoot.

1357
00:57:03,461 --> 00:57:03,980
It's still.

1358
00:57:03,980 --> 00:57:07,250
That's so weird.
It's like this weird toms shoes,

1359
00:57:07,251 --> 00:57:09,170
but also don't wear any shoes.
No nothing.

1360
00:57:09,171 --> 00:57:10,004
No one wears shoes anyway.
They get all the old shirts and all 

1361
00:57:11,361 --> 00:57:12,830
that.
So they get clothes from salvation army.

1362
00:57:12,831 --> 00:57:13,070
Yeah,
yeah,

1363
00:57:13,070 --> 00:57:13,903
yeah,
yeah.

1364
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:16,850
So they're wearing like this,
these,

1365
00:57:16,910 --> 00:57:19,560
these things from Western civilization 
what?

1366
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:24,600
And like Steve's got like he's got these
modern hoyt bow and they're both fishing

1367
00:57:25,071 --> 00:57:27,530
in the river for these things called a 
poc who,

1368
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:31,610
which is brilliant.
Red Fish is beautiful.

1369
00:57:31,611 --> 00:57:35,600
Red Fish and the whole scene is like so 
crazy.

1370
00:57:35,601 --> 00:57:36,434
It's like a combination of Western 
civilization because they've got like 

1371
00:57:40,521 --> 00:57:41,354
some western stuff mixed in with this 
culture that really hasn't changed that 

1372
00:57:45,681 --> 00:57:47,990
much and thousands and thousands of 
years.

1373
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:49,033
But then they find these petroglyphs 
that are by this waterfall and they 

1374
00:57:52,311 --> 00:57:53,500
don't know.
And he's like,

1375
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:55,010
it was like,
where do you think these came from?

1376
00:57:55,011 --> 00:57:55,850
It was like,
we don't know.

1377
00:57:55,970 --> 00:57:57,650
Nobody knows.
They say like the calm,

1378
00:57:57,651 --> 00:57:58,484
like the ancients,
the ancients wrote it like they don't 

1379
00:57:59,931 --> 00:58:00,764
even know who the fuck that.
So it could be thousands and thousands 

1380
00:58:02,811 --> 00:58:04,340
of years old.
That's fucking amazing.

1381
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:09,520
Drew these weird faces by this waterfall
and no one's curating it.

1382
00:58:10,171 --> 00:58:11,004
It just is what it is.
It's like really priceless history has 

1383
00:58:14,270 --> 00:58:15,170
just sitting there

1384
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:17,920
also there where they hang out just 
sitting there,

1385
00:58:18,150 --> 00:58:18,641
you know?
I mean,

1386
00:58:18,641 --> 00:58:20,470
that's Kinda like,
that's Kinda like when I was in Italy,

1387
00:58:20,471 --> 00:58:24,460
it's kind of like walking by these 
ancient structures and you're like,

1388
00:58:24,490 --> 00:58:26,110
that's just like a part of your fucking 
life.

1389
00:58:26,111 --> 00:58:27,370
That is also strange to me.

1390
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:28,240
Dude.
I was in,

1391
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:31,930
we showed some photos the other day was 
in Ravello and there was a church.

1392
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:32,441
No weird.
Yeah,

1393
00:58:32,441 --> 00:58:33,600
you were there right after me,
but that's all right.

1394
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:33,990
Yeah.
Yeah.

1395
00:58:33,990 --> 00:58:34,823
It was a church that was a thousand 
years old that was on top of a church 

1396
00:58:38,351 --> 00:58:40,450
that was far older.
They don't even know how old that church

1397
00:58:40,451 --> 00:58:41,284
was.
There was a glass floor where you could 

1398
00:58:42,461 --> 00:58:45,610
look under the church and see the 
ancient church that's below it.

1399
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:46,773
Oh,

1400
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:48,640
I went to this fucking place.
Yes.

1401
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:49,660
Yes.
You can look below.

1402
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:50,321
Yes,
yes,

1403
00:58:50,321 --> 00:58:51,160
yes.
Do it.

1404
00:58:51,161 --> 00:58:53,200
This is also.
We went to the catacombs.

1405
00:58:53,201 --> 00:58:54,880
Did you go to any of the catacombs?
No.

1406
00:58:54,910 --> 00:58:55,743
This shit is fucking.
I wish I could like catacombs in Italy 

1407
00:58:57,671 --> 00:58:58,504
too.
Yeah man.

1408
00:58:58,560 --> 00:58:59,393
I was like,
someone's in France where they have the 

1409
00:59:00,581 --> 00:59:02,260
skulls and all the shit I'm going to 
show you.

1410
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:04,540
I'll show you right now.
This is fucking crazy.

1411
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:09,370
So we went and also online by the way,
when I looked up how to get to them,

1412
00:59:09,550 --> 00:59:12,220
a lot of the online posts were like,
this isn't.

1413
00:59:12,850 --> 00:59:15,510
This isn't necessarily safe.
What the man,

1414
00:59:15,550 --> 00:59:16,241
what?
Wait a minute.

1415
00:59:16,241 --> 00:59:17,620
So this isn't safe.
Well,

1416
00:59:17,621 --> 00:59:21,090
they were just saying that's fucked.
Why?

1417
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:22,393
What is this?
But we'll describe what we're seeing 

1418
00:59:23,841 --> 00:59:25,100
here.
Are these standing up?

1419
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:26,053
Yeah.
So they have these skulls are what they 

1420
00:59:27,690 --> 00:59:29,240
do.
What they do is they,

1421
00:59:29,270 --> 00:59:32,300
they,
they reconfigure the bones of the,

1422
00:59:32,390 --> 00:59:33,223
of what they think the human was.
You know what they look like and they 

1423
00:59:35,631 --> 00:59:38,070
put them in cloth and stuff and stand up
against the law.

1424
00:59:38,210 --> 00:59:39,620
Go,
go full screen with that.

1425
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:41,700
Let me see.
That is what episode.

1426
00:59:42,410 --> 00:59:44,300
We'll look at that one with a flesh on 
them.

1427
00:59:44,570 --> 00:59:46,370
What's happening there?
The one where your cursor is,

1428
00:59:46,371 --> 00:59:49,550
Jamie,
is that hair on his head?

1429
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:53,240
Guy's dead as fuck.
You got more hair than me.

1430
00:59:53,570 --> 00:59:57,410
A Buddhist statue with a mummy in it.
No.

1431
00:59:57,530 --> 00:59:58,490
Oh,
that's right.

1432
00:59:58,491 --> 01:00:01,880
Yeah.
They found this statue and they did an x

1433
01:00:01,881 --> 01:00:06,320
ray of it and found that there was 
actual skeleton underneath the statue.

1434
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:08,450
Look at this.
The actual statute was a mummy.

1435
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:11,930
So this is in Naples,
Naples.

1436
01:00:13,130 --> 01:00:16,610
Those are all skulls and bones.
Isn't that fucked?

1437
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:17,610
What other cities?
Citizens you.

1438
01:00:17,610 --> 01:00:20,090
I heard Florence is amazing.
Florence is incredible.

1439
01:00:20,091 --> 01:00:20,730
I,
I,

1440
01:00:20,730 --> 01:00:22,020
you is cool too.
I liked.

1441
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:23,870
I think southern southern Italy is my 
favorite,

1442
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:25,820
but this is,
you see this shit.

1443
01:00:25,821 --> 01:00:26,900
Jamie,
southern Italy.

1444
01:00:27,110 --> 01:00:29,960
Sicily.
Sicily is my fucking favorite.

1445
01:00:29,961 --> 01:00:31,460
That's my absolute.
That's where my family's from.

1446
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:33,230
Know that their own place.
But I mean,

1447
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:34,213
I mean southern Italy,
like places like Naples and stuff like 

1448
01:00:36,261 --> 01:00:37,094
that.
Like they look down on you because you 

1449
01:00:37,641 --> 01:00:40,610
have red hair and when you go to Sicily 
they spit on me right away.

1450
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:41,440
No,
you don't.

1451
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:42,800
You know,
it was annoying as Santina.

1452
01:00:43,010 --> 01:00:43,843
My last name is Santana because my,
my family's from Sicily and they 

1453
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:49,220
immediately hear it.
They go Santino and anything.

1454
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:51,200
I'm going to speak Italian and then when
I don't,

1455
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:53,040
they're like annoyed.
Get Mad at you.

1456
01:00:53,270 --> 01:00:54,380
They're like,
no,

1457
01:00:54,470 --> 01:00:54,710
no,
no.

1458
01:00:54,710 --> 01:00:58,850
I went to somewhere better.
Where Marika English.

1459
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:00,570
We made it out English.
I made.

1460
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:02,660
That's why I came back here and gave you
money.

1461
01:01:02,750 --> 01:01:05,280
Money.
We also went to see.

1462
01:01:05,310 --> 01:01:08,030
That's fucked a dude that hung himself 
for sure.

1463
01:01:08,170 --> 01:01:09,890
No,
that's a little kid.

1464
01:01:11,130 --> 01:01:12,350
Little Dude.
Go to that.

1465
01:01:12,351 --> 01:01:14,090
Uh,
this is all in Rome.

1466
01:01:14,550 --> 01:01:19,010
I mean category.
They're all over the wall.

1467
01:01:19,130 --> 01:01:20,530
That's in Sicily.
Oh,

1468
01:01:20,540 --> 01:01:22,070
look on her face at this guy.

1469
01:01:24,290 --> 01:01:25,670
What do you want them to?
What do you want me to do?

1470
01:01:26,470 --> 01:01:28,740
What do you want from me?
We also went to savannah.

1471
01:01:28,830 --> 01:01:31,820
Do you know what's the Voca is?
No where they shot the godfather.

1472
01:01:31,910 --> 01:01:33,710
Look at this.
This is fucking incredible,

1473
01:01:33,711 --> 01:01:35,210
dude.
We went to this town where they shot the

1474
01:01:35,211 --> 01:01:38,000
godfather and so forth.
It must be just a bunch of assholes from

1475
01:01:38,001 --> 01:01:39,170
New Jersey.
Wandered around.

1476
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:44,600
Didn't narrow.
It's don corleone here.

1477
01:01:44,601 --> 01:01:46,630
Now.
Where do I get some Gaba?

1478
01:01:47,020 --> 01:01:48,890
Margo?
Come get a picture of me in front of his

1479
01:01:48,891 --> 01:01:50,000
fucking thing.
Come on,

1480
01:01:50,030 --> 01:01:51,010
hurry up.
You Fat.

1481
01:01:55,230 --> 01:01:59,300
Fuck all lane.
So what was this deal with this story of

1482
01:01:59,301 --> 01:02:03,140
the Buddha?
It was in 2015 is when it was.

1483
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:04,850
Oh,
it's too long ago for us to talk about.

1484
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:08,700
Let's pull it up.
What was it like a new discovery.

1485
01:02:08,770 --> 01:02:10,010
Oh yeah.
But I,

1486
01:02:10,130 --> 01:02:14,420
but it's a thing.
What do they know why they did that?

1487
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:19,600
So what did they do that did put plaster
over it and create A.

1488
01:02:19,810 --> 01:02:19,980
No,
if I'm

1489
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:21,390
going to have any more of this 46 year 
old,

1490
01:02:21,391 --> 01:02:22,224
but it really is nice to,
at this early in the morning to have a 

1491
01:02:23,431 --> 01:02:24,264
little bit of.
It's a little more ice in that thing 

1492
01:02:25,141 --> 01:02:25,891
over there.
I don't know.

1493
01:02:25,891 --> 01:02:27,750
I might have another one.
One more glass.

1494
01:02:27,870 --> 01:02:28,920
Just one more.
I might as well.

1495
01:02:28,921 --> 01:02:32,060
I'm more glass to taunt me to sober 
October man.

1496
01:02:32,190 --> 01:02:32,881
I can't,
I,

1497
01:02:32,881 --> 01:02:33,760
I'm,
I'm uh,

1498
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:36,960
I'm excited for the science of the 
curious.

1499
01:02:36,961 --> 01:02:37,794
So look,
they did an x ray on this Buddha and 

1500
01:02:39,421 --> 01:02:41,510
they found that there's an actual 
skeleton inside.

1501
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:43,770
Holy Shit.
How weird.

1502
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:48,030
How amazing.
It's not surprising that the southeast,

1503
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:50,910
the Southeast Asia is home to countless 
ancient Buddha statues,

1504
01:02:50,911 --> 01:02:51,744
but one of those statutes contain some 
modified monk that has certainly 

1505
01:02:54,031 --> 01:02:55,350
surprised Mo.
Five monkeys.

1506
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:56,193
Exactly.
Researches the Netherlands meander 

1507
01:02:57,901 --> 01:02:58,734
medical center Found they placed a 1000 
year old chinese buddhist statue inside 

1508
01:03:02,491 --> 01:03:03,480
of a ct scanner.

1509
01:03:04,020 --> 01:03:04,853
Wow.
Contains the body of buddhist master 

1510
01:03:07,081 --> 01:03:11,940
name.
Hell I you q and leah.

1511
01:03:12,570 --> 01:03:17,570
You knew kwan who may have practiced the
tradition of self mummification to reach

1512
01:03:19,771 --> 01:03:21,860
his final resting place.
He's like,

1513
01:03:21,930 --> 01:03:23,400
fuck that.
I'm wrapping myself out.

1514
01:03:23,790 --> 01:03:24,623
YEah,
this motherfucker just went hog whole 

1515
01:03:26,581 --> 01:03:27,414
hog.
That's a really funny photo range going 

1516
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:31,950
into the machine.
So how do you think they turned him into

1517
01:03:31,951 --> 01:03:33,270
that statue?
Like what did they.

1518
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:36,450
Would they put over?
His is so hot and so he probably wrapped

1519
01:03:36,451 --> 01:03:37,284
himself right.
And then it says the oregon's had been 

1520
01:03:40,321 --> 01:03:41,154
removed and replaced with paper scraps 
printer printed with ancient chinese 

1521
01:03:44,941 --> 01:03:47,490
characters.
Whoa.

1522
01:03:47,550 --> 01:03:49,650
That's so dope.
That's like a horror movie.

1523
01:03:51,740 --> 01:03:53,060
Yeah.
Tune in Stephen King.

1524
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:54,313
Okay.
If you were a month at wanting to 

1525
01:03:55,161 --> 01:03:58,670
achieve enlightenment and be revered as 
a living buddha,

1526
01:03:58,970 --> 01:04:02,780
self mummification was your brutal 
option.

1527
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:05,750
How is it brutal?
Monks in the spiritual path would starve

1528
01:04:05,751 --> 01:04:08,660
themselves for almost a decade,
subsisting on water,

1529
01:04:08,661 --> 01:04:09,494
seeds and nuts.
Then they'd be sealed inside the statue 

1530
01:04:14,121 --> 01:04:18,320
and ingest roots,
pine bark and a toxic tree,

1531
01:04:18,321 --> 01:04:21,740
sap based,
t for another 1000 days,

1532
01:04:22,010 --> 01:04:24,320
eating and breathing through a small 
tube.

1533
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:25,513
Eventually death would come and amongst 
mummified this manner were said to have 

1534
01:04:29,691 --> 01:04:32,240
reached enlightenment.
What?

1535
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:38,240
Talk somebody into that.
What the fuck?

1536
01:04:38,290 --> 01:04:39,230
All Right,
check it out.

1537
01:04:39,470 --> 01:04:41,000
We're going to plug you in this fucking 
thing,

1538
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:42,890
bro.
You have to breathe through a tube.

1539
01:04:42,891 --> 01:04:43,700
Dude,
you can only.

1540
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:46,490
You could only drink this toxic t that's
going to slowly kill you.

1541
01:04:46,610 --> 01:04:48,650
You want to be a god.
You want to see god?

1542
01:04:48,651 --> 01:04:51,260
Dude,
do you want to fucking see god for three

1543
01:04:51,261 --> 01:04:52,094
years you're goiNg to eat nothing but 
seeds and we're going to wrap you and 

1544
01:04:55,071 --> 01:04:56,450
you're going to breathe through a 
fucking tube.

1545
01:04:56,540 --> 01:04:57,373
It's going to be ultimate panic.
They starve themselves for almost a 

1546
01:05:00,950 --> 01:05:01,783
decade.
Where would they piss and shit while 

1547
01:05:02,271 --> 01:05:04,220
they're in here for a thousand days of 
bob?

1548
01:05:04,420 --> 01:05:08,630
Come on a little pool.
It would come right out of their mouth.

1549
01:05:09,790 --> 01:05:12,140
That's what motherfuckers you.
That's the shit.

1550
01:05:12,820 --> 01:05:13,653
That's the glue.
They would stay in the statue and they 

1551
01:05:16,111 --> 01:05:18,070
would fill up with shit

1552
01:05:18,740 --> 01:05:20,530
and went and that's when they die.
That's it.

1553
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:21,393
That would took a thousand days to 
gargle on shit until you finally smell 

1554
01:05:25,241 --> 01:05:26,074
shit up to your nostrils.
You'd have shit right up to the lip of 

1555
01:05:28,361 --> 01:05:32,800
your nose.
This is an example of self mummification

1556
01:05:33,350 --> 01:05:34,183
fact that his organs removed and 
replaced the paper suggest that may not 

1557
01:05:36,041 --> 01:05:36,671
be true.
All right?

1558
01:05:36,671 --> 01:05:37,960
So all this.
Oh,

1559
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:42,370
this all this could be bullshit.
It's going to be some dude just assholes

1560
01:05:42,710 --> 01:05:45,820
because this is an asshole article.
Toxic t,

1561
01:05:45,850 --> 01:05:47,860
the toxic t thing I think is 
fascinating.

1562
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:50,770
That's just another mind control way of 
them solely killing our people.

1563
01:05:51,220 --> 01:05:54,790
Toxic t.
But someone must have probably done that

1564
01:05:55,010 --> 01:05:57,400
because like,
no matter what you do,

1565
01:05:57,401 --> 01:05:59,320
there's always someone who's willing to 
go further,

1566
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:01,050
you know,
um,

1567
01:06:01,220 --> 01:06:03,160
you know,
they do those ultra marathons,

1568
01:06:03,161 --> 01:06:06,610
right where they run like 200 miles.
They're trying to.

1569
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:09,340
Cameron hanes runs $9,
million miles a day,

1570
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:11,680
whereas a marathon a day,
this is a machine.

1571
01:06:11,681 --> 01:06:13,150
Crazy fuck.
So,

1572
01:06:13,151 --> 01:06:13,984
um,
what they're,

1573
01:06:13,990 --> 01:06:15,790
you know,
he was going to do while we're doing all

1574
01:06:15,791 --> 01:06:16,624
this sober october fitness challenge,
he was going to try to get more fitness 

1575
01:06:19,091 --> 01:06:21,130
points in all of us combined.
Probably,

1576
01:06:21,220 --> 01:06:23,680
probably,
probably not that hard to be honest.

1577
01:06:24,690 --> 01:06:26,460
He could do it easy.
But um,

1578
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:30,100
what they're going to do now is a 500 
mile race,

1579
01:06:30,550 --> 01:06:33,280
500 fucking miles,
500 miles.

1580
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:34,870
They run stuff.
He runs fast though.

1581
01:06:34,871 --> 01:06:36,280
It's all about time though.
He wouldn't,

1582
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:38,480
he'd have to run for six hours a day.
He had to,

1583
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:42,700
when you sit it.
But this is running guys 24 slash seven.

1584
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:46,060
No,
he sang about minutes.

1585
01:06:46,061 --> 01:06:46,894
So he had to.
But he runs three hours a day all the 

1586
01:06:48,641 --> 01:06:49,930
time.
If he's running marathons,

1587
01:06:49,931 --> 01:06:51,680
he's not running more than three hour 
marathons.

1588
01:06:51,750 --> 01:06:53,410
I'd love to know,
do you want three hours a day?

1589
01:06:53,411 --> 01:06:54,580
Do you know how many miles you know how 
many,

1590
01:06:54,670 --> 01:06:56,200
how fast you run?
It's eight or nine miles an hour.

1591
01:06:56,230 --> 01:06:58,160
Do you know what it is?
I tell you what.

1592
01:06:58,161 --> 01:07:02,320
I wonder if it's eight or nine grand.
His first 100 or no,

1593
01:07:02,380 --> 01:07:04,210
when he ran his first $200,
big foot.

1594
01:07:04,211 --> 01:07:05,044
200.
The last Couple hours he was running a 

1595
01:07:07,961 --> 01:07:10,450
seven minute mile.
Do you know what I'm saying?

1596
01:07:10,451 --> 01:07:11,284
That is.
Do you know insane it is that 10 

1597
01:07:12,671 --> 01:07:14,170
minutes?
Is that time at 10 miles an hour?

1598
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:15,913
Pretty much nine and some change,
But just to just understand how insane 

1599
01:07:18,581 --> 01:07:22,690
it is.
He running for two straight days,

1600
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:23,553
come on to run more than a hundred and 
70 miles and then the last two plus 

1601
01:07:30,101 --> 01:07:31,510
hours,
I think maybe even more.

1602
01:07:31,511 --> 01:07:32,211
He probably like.
Well,

1603
01:07:32,211 --> 01:07:34,630
it was actually five hours staunch 
about.

1604
01:07:34,930 --> 01:07:37,600
He's running seven minute miles.
That's fucking insane.

1605
01:07:37,810 --> 01:07:38,720
That's bananas.
Yeah.

1606
01:07:38,730 --> 01:07:39,563
No,
that's insane.

1607
01:07:39,910 --> 01:07:40,870
That's lit.
I run,

1608
01:07:40,930 --> 01:07:41,763
I run five miles a day and that's if I,
in my mind are like almost eight minute 

1609
01:07:46,031 --> 01:07:47,110
miles,
seven minute miles,

1610
01:07:47,111 --> 01:07:49,720
it could clip.
That's a good to great.

1611
01:07:49,721 --> 01:07:50,554
You kidding me.
Especially when you were anyone that 

1612
01:07:51,431 --> 01:07:52,264
runs over anyone that's just a casual 
runner that runs over two or three 

1613
01:07:54,791 --> 01:07:55,624
miles.
They their goal usually is a eight to 

1614
01:07:57,611 --> 01:07:58,444
nine minute miles to keep good pace.
Seven minute miles after you've already 

1615
01:08:00,701 --> 01:08:01,534
run hundreds of miles,
but that was the point is like there's 

1616
01:08:06,101 --> 01:08:06,934
always someone who's willing to take to 
another place and that's the thing with 

1617
01:08:10,091 --> 01:08:12,280
these buddhist assholes,
they always wanting to push.

1618
01:08:12,340 --> 01:08:13,740
One guy's like,
oh,

1619
01:08:13,780 --> 01:08:15,860
you're just going to literally live off 
seeds for a decade.

1620
01:08:16,210 --> 01:08:17,043
I'm going to do toxic teeth.
I'm going to live off seats for a 

1621
01:08:19,010 --> 01:08:19,843
decade.
Then I'm going to seal myself in a 

1622
01:08:20,211 --> 01:08:24,380
fucking statue that I'm going to drink 
poison and that I'm going to die.

1623
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:27,320
I'm gonna.
Get my oWn shit.

1624
01:08:30,770 --> 01:08:33,380
Why?
Because I want to be enlightened.

1625
01:08:33,590 --> 01:08:36,550
I want to get to the tip top buddy.
Enlightened marijuana,

1626
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:37,413
understand suffering at.
The buddhists are like these italian 

1627
01:08:41,001 --> 01:08:41,834
gangsters.
I want to understand something on the 

1628
01:08:46,130 --> 01:08:48,950
deepest level possible though.
What you Choke on your own.

1629
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,310
I want to choke on my own poop in my own
self rep sarcophagus,

1630
01:08:52,311 --> 01:08:53,144
seed eaton tool breathe and fucking 
mumbly statue or one of the most iconic 

1631
01:08:56,901 --> 01:09:00,410
images from the Vietnam war was the self
immolation guy.

1632
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:01,580
Oh shit.
Yeah.

1633
01:09:01,730 --> 01:09:03,080
You ever see the video,
man,

1634
01:09:03,110 --> 01:09:04,070
that's.
It's that.

1635
01:09:04,071 --> 01:09:04,904
Pull up the video of the guy,
the buddhist monk lighting himself on 

1636
01:09:08,721 --> 01:09:10,630
fire.
It's just sad image.

1637
01:09:11,260 --> 01:09:13,220
Well,
the most fucked up thing about it is the

1638
01:09:13,221 --> 01:09:15,080
guy didn't even move now.
Yes.

1639
01:09:15,081 --> 01:09:15,914
That's stays.
He's in the lotus position and he's 

1640
01:09:17,870 --> 01:09:19,940
completely engulfed in flame

1641
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:25,060
and he's just staying self-immolation.
That's a weird Bird,

1642
01:09:25,131 --> 01:09:26,630
right?
Mla to emulate.

1643
01:09:27,140 --> 01:09:30,320
Slow motion.
So they pour the gasoline,

1644
01:09:30,350 --> 01:09:33,170
the gasoline on him.
Nineteen 63.

1645
01:09:33,350 --> 01:09:34,183
So this was really the start of the war.
The war went on for more than a decade 

1646
01:09:37,071 --> 01:09:37,904
afterwards,
right?

1647
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,050
Yeah,
he was really early.

1648
01:09:39,830 --> 01:09:41,300
He's like,
you know what enough.

1649
01:09:41,301 --> 01:09:44,210
I'm going to put an end to this.
Imagine if they said to him beforehand,

1650
01:09:44,211 --> 01:09:44,980
yo,
dude,

1651
01:09:44,980 --> 01:09:45,813
it's not always.
It's not going to work with the war's 

1652
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:50,330
going to go on for another 10 years is a
bad idea to stick around.

1653
01:09:50,331 --> 01:09:53,210
And if you play your cards right,
you keep wind up inside of statue.

1654
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:56,830
This is like worldstar,
worldstar jesus fucking.

1655
01:09:57,780 --> 01:10:00,590
It's just so crazy because the guy's 
just sitting there.

1656
01:10:01,610 --> 01:10:04,160
I mean covered,
inflames,

1657
01:10:04,220 --> 01:10:07,140
not moving a muscle.
It's sucH a,

1658
01:10:07,220 --> 01:10:09,410
such a bizarre scene.
like we get them here.

1659
01:10:09,770 --> 01:10:12,950
Yeah.
And at this point he realIzes,

1660
01:10:12,980 --> 01:10:13,910
oh shit,
I'm dead.

1661
01:10:14,140 --> 01:10:15,080
They just falls over.

1662
01:10:18,230 --> 01:10:19,063
What a crazy way to die.
So fucking and all the other dudes just 

1663
01:10:23,721 --> 01:10:24,930
sitting around going,
oh,

1664
01:10:25,050 --> 01:10:26,160
I didn't do that.
Yeah,

1665
01:10:26,170 --> 01:10:27,590
they're all thinking about lunch.
I was like,

1666
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:30,860
we're not going to eat rice.
What do we have for lunch?

1667
01:10:30,861 --> 01:10:33,830
Rice for dinner.
I'm hungry.

1668
01:10:33,860 --> 01:10:34,760
Reading rice,
bitch.

1669
01:10:35,010 --> 01:10:36,080
I ain't.
That's crazy.

1670
01:10:36,081 --> 01:10:38,390
What if the match didn't work the first 
few times?

1671
01:10:38,391 --> 01:10:39,224
You know,
he was like,

1672
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:40,081
wait,
wait,

1673
01:10:40,081 --> 01:10:40,341
wait,
wait,

1674
01:10:40,341 --> 01:10:41,174
wait,
wait,

1675
01:10:41,270 --> 01:10:43,340
hold on.
Let's think about this.

1676
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:47,170
Fuck man.
I mean that whole thing is just.

1677
01:10:47,171 --> 01:10:49,310
So that's just.
What does that.

1678
01:10:49,311 --> 01:10:50,810
What was that picture at the fucking 
end?

1679
01:10:51,140 --> 01:10:52,880
What is that?
What does it say?

1680
01:10:54,140 --> 01:10:56,840
10 superpowers and the mach seven real 
life.

1681
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:58,150
I'm.
No,

1682
01:10:58,240 --> 01:10:59,073
no,
no.

1683
01:11:00,350 --> 01:11:01,183
Well,
there are some monks that can do some 

1684
01:11:02,181 --> 01:11:03,014
pretty cool athletic shit because they 
don't get any pussy and they just eat 

1685
01:11:06,531 --> 01:11:09,170
nuts and do pushups,
pushups,

1686
01:11:09,180 --> 01:11:10,013
nuts,
seeds.

1687
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:14,160
But that was like a thing where like 
people would go to train

1688
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:14,993
with the monks to learn come food.
Do they really have depravity of like 

1689
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:20,640
releasing?
They can't come amongst.

1690
01:11:20,641 --> 01:11:22,350
Can't come.
That's a good question.

1691
01:11:22,530 --> 01:11:23,363
I wonder.
I wonder if they come in their parents 

1692
01:11:24,181 --> 01:11:25,170
accidentaLly.
If they get mad.

1693
01:11:25,171 --> 01:11:25,890
Well,
you have to write.

1694
01:11:25,890 --> 01:11:26,723
You know that shipped biologically.
It's a detriment if you or if you don't 

1695
01:11:28,921 --> 01:11:31,740
ejaculate at some point in your life,
you will just naturally leaK.

1696
01:11:31,950 --> 01:11:33,540
This is what your teacher told you.
That's a fact.

1697
01:11:33,570 --> 01:11:35,060
Look that up.
That's a fucking fact.

1698
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:37,530
You will leak jamie.
Tell them.

1699
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:39,600
Tell them about your thinking about the 
tantrum.

1700
01:11:39,601 --> 01:11:42,150
People.
Jamie nuts all the time.

1701
01:11:42,220 --> 01:11:44,800
Tells us about these.
Another.

1702
01:11:47,910 --> 01:11:51,000
Jamie,
are you a nut king thing?

1703
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:55,230
How much do you know a week?
If you had to guess how many times,

1704
01:11:55,470 --> 01:11:56,303
oh,
how many times does I agree to as 

1705
01:11:56,850 --> 01:11:58,710
measurement.
I was like three cups.

1706
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:03,570
How many tablespoons and isn't salted 
for four or five nights a week?

1707
01:12:03,571 --> 01:12:05,440
Four or five nights a week.
Seems normal first.

1708
01:12:05,570 --> 01:12:08,160
Maybe even days a week.
There may be a little bit more.

1709
01:12:08,190 --> 01:12:12,030
Maybe get really randy.
Sometimes it's seven nuts.

1710
01:12:12,090 --> 01:12:13,650
If you lifted weights,
maybe it's seven.

1711
01:12:14,190 --> 01:12:15,900
If I'm.
You know what's so funny?

1712
01:12:16,020 --> 01:12:19,470
I get way more horny after running.
Running,

1713
01:12:19,530 --> 01:12:20,363
running gets me horny as shit when I'm 
done because my body's kind of 

1714
01:12:22,441 --> 01:12:24,540
exhausted,
so usually I lift,

1715
01:12:24,570 --> 01:12:25,403
I lift a little bit and then I run or 
vice versa or I'll run in and I'll lift 

1716
01:12:28,091 --> 01:12:30,190
to finish,
but the running just like,

1717
01:12:30,390 --> 01:12:33,030
I think it exhausts my body and then 
that just want a bag.

1718
01:12:33,060 --> 01:12:33,600
I just.
Yeah,

1719
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:34,433
you might.
I think my testosterone is just like I 

1720
01:12:35,671 --> 01:12:36,504
got.
I want to not don't amongst the tantric 

1721
01:12:39,481 --> 01:12:42,180
stuff where they can like do it without 
touching anyone kind of thing,

1722
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:44,033
but for sexting,
sting does that shit where he doesn't 

1723
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:48,960
see.
He doesn't come in for like nine days.

1724
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:50,980
It's called being a pervert.
Dude.

1725
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:55,020
Stop thinking about that fucking weirdo.
It's like people are doing that.

1726
01:12:55,021 --> 01:12:57,170
They're thinking about sex way more than
the average person.

1727
01:12:57,270 --> 01:12:59,340
Just fuck no,
I'm just kinda hold it in.

1728
01:12:59,550 --> 01:13:03,580
I'm going to have internal orgasms.
I want to have an external.

1729
01:13:06,530 --> 01:13:10,740
It's all flooding back into your system.
I hope that's the face.

1730
01:13:10,741 --> 01:13:12,690
I hope you go cross eyed when you come 
home.

1731
01:13:12,780 --> 01:13:15,720
It's like,
and I always make a fish mouth.

1732
01:13:22,310 --> 01:13:25,920
imagine if you were a girl,
was perfect in every way,

1733
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:31,100
but when she comes she would go jello 
pudding.

1734
01:13:34,100 --> 01:13:35,160
Oh,
this is great.

1735
01:13:35,161 --> 01:13:37,560
I can't.
I had a girl that I dated,

1736
01:13:37,561 --> 01:13:39,150
I won't,
obviously I won't mention who,

1737
01:13:39,151 --> 01:13:39,984
but years and years and years ago I 
dated a girl in college and she was so 

1738
01:13:43,021 --> 01:13:43,854
beautiful,
but when she would come it was so 

1739
01:13:45,901 --> 01:13:47,430
annoying.
Like it was like a.

1740
01:13:47,460 --> 01:13:48,293
It was like,
it was so exaggerated that I remember 

1741
01:13:50,551 --> 01:13:51,384
catching myself in the mirror one time,
giving myself this face as she was 

1742
01:13:53,971 --> 01:13:54,804
yelling,
I was going.

1743
01:13:56,200 --> 01:14:01,200
I was rolling my eyes like,
oh yeah,

1744
01:14:03,310 --> 01:14:05,560
but I was also like,
my dick is in fucking like,

1745
01:14:05,610 --> 01:14:06,750
don't.
Let's not play the game.

1746
01:14:06,751 --> 01:14:08,940
Like it's not so big.
Just come on,

1747
01:14:08,970 --> 01:14:10,830
do the regular fucking.
Don't give me this.

1748
01:14:11,290 --> 01:14:15,610
Do you think she was faking it or do you
think she was hyperbolizing her orgasms?

1749
01:14:15,730 --> 01:14:19,450
I think it was doing that to please you.
I think she thought it was pleasing me.

1750
01:14:19,451 --> 01:14:20,950
It was doing the opposite.
It was making me go,

1751
01:14:21,010 --> 01:14:21,843
oh my god,
I'm going to show just regular come and 

1752
01:14:24,900 --> 01:14:29,900
service with this or she starts punching
you.

1753
01:14:36,090 --> 01:14:39,220
I just start.
I just start crying.

1754
01:14:39,221 --> 01:14:40,210
She's coming.
I'm crying.

1755
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:43,420
Yeah.
Yeah.

1756
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:46,810
You just hold your is exaggerated.
I think that's what porno does.

1757
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:49,340
Porno tricks.
People in porn because porn girls like.

1758
01:14:50,740 --> 01:14:51,573
It's like,
no,

1759
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:53,200
that's fucking insane.
Yeah.

1760
01:14:53,201 --> 01:14:54,034
Do you ever hear porn?
And then they do that and you just want 

1761
01:14:55,391 --> 01:14:57,640
to shut it off.
Turn off the volume.

1762
01:14:57,730 --> 01:14:58,840
I'm like,
this is absurd.

1763
01:14:58,990 --> 01:14:59,823
Yeah,
but then you're going to look at her 

1764
01:14:59,981 --> 01:15:00,551
face and.
No,

1765
01:15:00,551 --> 01:15:01,900
she's making stupid noises.
Yeah,

1766
01:15:01,901 --> 01:15:04,630
because it's going to be distracting to.
It's already in there.

1767
01:15:04,631 --> 01:15:06,050
You're like,
I can't disassociate.

1768
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:11,080
This always impresses me in porno is 
when like a girl is taken like a fucking

1769
01:15:13,030 --> 01:15:15,940
12 inch dick like some and they're not 
being loud.

1770
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,310
Like I'm always like,
this girl is a fucking thug.

1771
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:22,840
What a soldier that she's getting fucked
and she just like,

1772
01:15:23,530 --> 01:15:26,130
it's no big deal.
Me.

1773
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:28,200
I like just looking at it.
You're like this.

1774
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:31,120
There's no way that's not painful.
That's a good point about porn though,

1775
01:15:31,121 --> 01:15:31,954
right?
It's like people imitate like people 

1776
01:15:33,611 --> 01:15:34,444
imitate behavior and films like we were 
talking about all the guido's and 

1777
01:15:36,911 --> 01:15:40,900
imitate god father movies and the 
soprano's that they imitate it,

1778
01:15:40,930 --> 01:15:42,900
they see it,
they want to act like it.

1779
01:15:42,901 --> 01:15:46,660
It's exaggerated.
Emulate a lifestyle tHat's the same with

1780
01:15:46,661 --> 01:15:48,110
porn.
Sex.

1781
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:48,953
There's got to be a lot of people that 
are emulating the sounds and the noises 

1782
01:15:52,751 --> 01:15:53,584
in the postures and all that stuff.
Like when do you think people started 

1783
01:15:57,401 --> 01:16:01,750
regular coming in people's faces.
What year?

1784
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:05,950
What year was the first pioneer in porno
that did like a first come shot?

1785
01:16:05,990 --> 01:16:06,823
Like in the thirties,
you think people get it in people's 

1786
01:16:08,171 --> 01:16:09,004
faces are now.
They didn't ever pulled their dick 

1787
01:16:10,311 --> 01:16:11,141
south.
They didn't know.

1788
01:16:11,141 --> 01:16:12,750
They didn't know you could pull out and 
the thirties,

1789
01:16:12,751 --> 01:16:14,890
that was the name inside people and just
came inside everybody.

1790
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:16,060
Everybody had a baby.
Well,

1791
01:16:16,061 --> 01:16:17,540
yeah,
I mean you think about a timeline wise,

1792
01:16:17,570 --> 01:16:19,930
like fucking pregnancy at.
Look at the baby boomer generation.

1793
01:16:19,931 --> 01:16:23,380
Not one person pulled out.
My mom's one of 10 kids.

1794
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:24,513
Oh yeah man.
Nobody born in the fifties was ever 

1795
01:16:27,431 --> 01:16:29,410
pulled out.
I mean like everyone.

1796
01:16:29,530 --> 01:16:30,363
That's just what you did.
And then disease and then we and then 

1797
01:16:33,431 --> 01:16:34,264
disease in the seventies and eighties 
spawned this idea of condoms and 

1798
01:16:37,481 --> 01:16:39,280
protection and then people started 
learning.

1799
01:16:39,450 --> 01:16:41,410
maybe we will just not come inside of 
people.

1800
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:44,080
Well,
they say that one of the biggest changes

1801
01:16:44,081 --> 01:16:44,914
in culture was female birth control 
because finally women had control of 

1802
01:16:48,461 --> 01:16:49,850
their own reproductive side.
Right?

1803
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:55,510
But what comes with that is that theY 
have to take hormones to achieve that.

1804
01:16:55,550 --> 01:16:58,150
Yet he fucking up their chemical inside.
Dude,

1805
01:16:58,151 --> 01:17:01,750
have you ever heard like what actually 
happens to women?

1806
01:17:01,751 --> 01:17:04,000
it doesn't just fuck up their chemical 
insides,

1807
01:17:04,270 --> 01:17:06,140
fuck up their hormonal cycle.
Right?

1808
01:17:06,220 --> 01:17:07,053
But it also fucks up their ability to 
discern whether someone is compatible 

1809
01:17:09,411 --> 01:17:10,244
with them

1810
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:12,980
seriously.
Like it fucks up the science of there.

1811
01:17:13,010 --> 01:17:15,410
There's,
there's a thing that women get,

1812
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:18,950
like there's a.
Chris ryan was explaining this to me.

1813
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:19,993
There's an actual smell like women can 
pheromonal like when they're not on 

1814
01:17:25,701 --> 01:17:26,534
birth control,
like if they get guys clothes and like 

1815
01:17:28,821 --> 01:17:29,960
through a smell guys,
clothes,

1816
01:17:29,970 --> 01:17:34,370
they can literally,
they are attracted to certain smells and

1817
01:17:34,371 --> 01:17:39,371
the men that the smell this way would be
more genetically compatible with them.

1818
01:17:40,070 --> 01:17:42,650
So the pheromones literally is the 
fairmont.

1819
01:17:42,651 --> 01:17:44,300
There's a pheromone blocker with birth 
control.

1820
01:17:44,301 --> 01:17:46,730
Then that's kinda what it confuses their
system.

1821
01:17:47,090 --> 01:17:47,923
Also,
women who are on birth control are much 

1822
01:17:50,001 --> 01:17:50,834
more attractive attracted apparently to 
alpha male type characters and 

1823
01:17:55,431 --> 01:17:57,350
aggressive men.
Really?

1824
01:17:57,380 --> 01:17:57,920
Yeah.
Yeah.

1825
01:17:57,920 --> 01:18:00,230
There's something about birth control 
that makes them.

1826
01:18:00,980 --> 01:18:04,790
They're not sure why their 
attractiveness towards alpha males.

1827
01:18:04,820 --> 01:18:06,860
Yeah.
They're more attracted to alpha males.

1828
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:08,580
Well that's not really a negative thing 
I guess,

1829
01:18:08,830 --> 01:18:12,470
but they're more attracted to certain 
types of people.

1830
01:18:12,470 --> 01:18:13,540
And you gotta think like,
whoa,

1831
01:18:13,570 --> 01:18:14,403
what is that?
It's like I'm not a sociologist or a 

1832
01:18:19,431 --> 01:18:20,264
biologist.
I really wouldn't know what the fuck 

1833
01:18:21,411 --> 01:18:22,244
would be the cause of that,
but I would think that it would have 

1834
01:18:23,961 --> 01:18:24,794
something to do with their body wanting 
something different than the baby that 

1835
01:18:27,831 --> 01:18:31,160
they think is inside them because 
they're supposed to be pregnant.

1836
01:18:31,370 --> 01:18:32,203
Like this is the whole reason why you 
can't get pregnant when you were on 

1837
01:18:34,251 --> 01:18:36,250
birth.
Control is to pregnant.

1838
01:18:36,530 --> 01:18:37,363
Right?
So you're walking around constantly in 

1839
01:18:38,721 --> 01:18:39,554
the state of pregnancy,
so like why would you be more attracted 

1840
01:18:43,191 --> 01:18:45,890
to alpha males or aggressive men?
God,

1841
01:18:45,891 --> 01:18:46,724
look at my brain.
It's like hunting for a why that would 

1842
01:18:47,811 --> 01:18:48,644
even make sense.
The only thing that would make sense as 

1843
01:18:49,941 --> 01:18:52,850
you want something even more aggressive 
or dominant,

1844
01:18:52,851 --> 01:18:55,010
tory or better or pretending what you've
gotten.

1845
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:56,300
Maybe more protective.

1846
01:18:56,330 --> 01:18:59,500
Maybe you think maybe it's it goes and 
maybe it's just superb nature.

1847
01:19:00,530 --> 01:19:02,120
All those nature characteristics of 
like,

1848
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:04,460
I'm pregnant,
I need ultimate protection.

1849
01:19:04,461 --> 01:19:05,294
I need ultimate aggression,
ultimate strength and like these are 

1850
01:19:08,241 --> 01:19:09,440
just all natural.
By the way,

1851
01:19:09,441 --> 01:19:11,810
all the fucking equality websites is 
probably lighten me up for that.

1852
01:19:11,811 --> 01:19:13,010
You know what I mean?
go crazy.

1853
01:19:13,070 --> 01:19:15,770
well,
I was reading this biologists account of

1854
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:16,753
what's a,
there's a term called hyper gummy that 

1855
01:19:19,581 --> 01:19:20,414
it's a natural state for women to be 
attracted and to seek out men with 

1856
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:30,380
higher social status,
higher financial status programming.

1857
01:19:30,410 --> 01:19:32,840
Yeah,
and beTter physical specimens.

1858
01:19:33,050 --> 01:19:33,883
that's just natural state where they're 
always looking for something bigger and 

1859
01:19:36,981 --> 01:19:40,190
better.
It's just a genetic state and it's not.

1860
01:19:40,220 --> 01:19:41,660
It's no one's fault.
I mean,

1861
01:19:41,661 --> 01:19:44,240
and women obviously don't have to give 
into this,

1862
01:19:44,420 --> 01:19:46,940
but as a natural inclination that they 
had,

1863
01:19:47,290 --> 01:19:48,710
like if the rock is there.

1864
01:19:48,940 --> 01:19:50,150
Right.
Here's perfect example.

1865
01:19:50,390 --> 01:19:52,610
He's rich and he's handsome,
huge,

1866
01:19:52,611 --> 01:19:55,490
friendly,
and is a giant man and he's probably got

1867
01:19:55,491 --> 01:20:00,491
a huge hog and you're a woman is 
naturally attracted to go towards him.

1868
01:20:00,531 --> 01:20:01,410
So am,
I mean,

1869
01:20:02,650 --> 01:20:05,390
I know you got a great bit about them,
but this,

1870
01:20:05,420 --> 01:20:08,170
this state is.
It's called hyperthermia.

1871
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:09,593
Yeah.
And that what I was reading about was 

1872
01:20:12,061 --> 01:20:17,061
this woman who had this awful betrayal 
of this man and she was the.

1873
01:20:17,630 --> 01:20:18,463
The biologist was relating it to the 
state of hyperglycemia if they were 

1874
01:20:23,251 --> 01:20:25,320
doing it in a very scientific sort of 
technical way.

1875
01:20:25,690 --> 01:20:27,600
Instead of like saying,
look at this slot,

1876
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:30,360
they were saying this is a natural 
state.

1877
01:20:30,510 --> 01:20:33,960
Totally.
Women gravitate towards certain types of

1878
01:20:33,961 --> 01:20:35,430
males,
you know,

1879
01:20:35,431 --> 01:20:38,370
and that this is.
But this is not discussed very often,

1880
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:38,801
right?
No,

1881
01:20:38,801 --> 01:20:39,000
no,
no,

1882
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:39,833
because.
Well,

1883
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:40,673
eSpecially because now we're bending all
these rules and names and terms and all 

1884
01:20:42,871 --> 01:20:44,580
this bullshit.
It's like the people.

1885
01:20:44,730 --> 01:20:48,390
I think there's such an escapism from 
like the true nature of,

1886
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:49,890
of,
of men and women.

1887
01:20:50,310 --> 01:20:52,500
People don't want to talk about anymore.
Like it doesn't exist.

1888
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:55,140
The denial of biology.
It's so crazy to me.

1889
01:20:55,230 --> 01:20:56,063
Well,
it's almost like this whole fucking 

1890
01:20:56,701 --> 01:20:57,534
cavenaugh thing and all this shit and I 
don't want to even get into all that 

1891
01:20:59,161 --> 01:20:59,994
fucking said diatribe of nonsense,
but the one thing I will say that I 

1892
01:21:03,211 --> 01:21:04,044
don't think anybody talks about the 
sexual and social psychology of men and 

1893
01:21:07,681 --> 01:21:08,514
women.
Nobody wants to talk about when you are 

1894
01:21:10,231 --> 01:21:12,810
developing as a young teen,
especially a boy,

1895
01:21:12,811 --> 01:21:13,644
and you're learning about sexuality and 
you're confused and embarrassed and 

1896
01:21:15,511 --> 01:21:18,990
scared and the way that men and women 
interact in that year,

1897
01:21:19,390 --> 01:21:24,390
in those years from like 12 to 16,
it's insanely unstable because women are

1898
01:21:25,681 --> 01:21:29,730
not as a,
not as hormonally aggressive technically

1899
01:21:29,731 --> 01:21:30,690
at that time that men are.

1900
01:21:30,690 --> 01:21:33,840
Right.
so these men are fucking hormonal freaks

1901
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:35,520
and they want to do things with these 
women,

1902
01:21:35,521 --> 01:21:36,354
but they're not supposed to kind of.
And it's kind of okay and they don't 

1903
01:21:38,761 --> 01:21:41,580
know how to do it.
And they're these weird blurred lines of

1904
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:44,570
women want to be accepted in cool.
And they're in their circles.

1905
01:21:44,571 --> 01:21:45,391
So,
you know,

1906
01:21:45,391 --> 01:21:46,224
it's like when someone hooks up with 
someone early on when poop to people 

1907
01:21:49,261 --> 01:21:50,460
hook up young and it's like,
ooh.

1908
01:21:50,461 --> 01:21:53,370
And it's sketchy and weird.
Sometimes the girl gets labeled a slut,

1909
01:21:53,670 --> 01:21:55,230
you know what I mean?
For no reason.

1910
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:55,921
It's Like,
oh,

1911
01:21:55,921 --> 01:21:57,450
she's like,
I remember there was a girl in my,

1912
01:21:57,870 --> 01:21:59,630
when we were what,
um,

1913
01:22:00,220 --> 01:22:03,150
juniors and she was dating a senior and 
they had had sex.

1914
01:22:03,750 --> 01:22:04,680
You're right.
And it Was like,

1915
01:22:04,740 --> 01:22:06,060
she's a slut,
she's not a slut,

1916
01:22:06,061 --> 01:22:09,300
everybody wants to do this thing,
but there are these weird subset rules,

1917
01:22:09,301 --> 01:22:12,450
but every guy that does it,
that's just what we want to do.

1918
01:22:12,451 --> 01:22:13,440
But I don't,
we.

1919
01:22:13,480 --> 01:22:14,313
There's no explanation over like how we 
got to the point of getting comfortable 

1920
01:22:17,611 --> 01:22:18,444
there because men are just these horny 
freaks that don't know what to do with 

1921
01:22:20,911 --> 01:22:21,744
the thing.
So there are so many blurred lines of 

1922
01:22:23,791 --> 01:22:27,060
sexuality and relationships at that age.
Nobody wants to talk about it.

1923
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:28,633
Puritan culture and religion are two 
things that set women up in this 

1924
01:22:31,701 --> 01:22:32,534
terrible place where they give into 
their hormonal oranges there somehow 

1925
01:22:35,931 --> 01:22:37,400
tainted.
You know,

1926
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:38,593
I was in high school.
Everybody knew this and I'm sure you 

1927
01:22:40,071 --> 01:22:40,904
knew this to everybody knew catholic 
school girls were the biggest fucking 

1928
01:22:43,961 --> 01:22:44,350
thing.

1929
01:22:44,350 --> 01:22:45,183
First time I had anal catholics will 
call a first and second time because 

1930
01:22:49,630 --> 01:22:51,180
they are,
they're suppressed.

1931
01:22:51,270 --> 01:22:53,320
Yes.
There you're making diamonds.

1932
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:54,233
Okay.
You can take in that you're putting it 

1933
01:22:55,541 --> 01:22:56,374
under a mountain,
at a fucking diamond is going to come 

1934
01:22:58,121 --> 01:22:59,800
out of,
you know,

1935
01:22:59,801 --> 01:23:01,750
I mean,
it's catholic school girls,

1936
01:23:01,751 --> 01:23:03,160
right?
And it's all over tHe country.

1937
01:23:03,161 --> 01:23:04,420
Where did you grow up in chicago?
Chicago,

1938
01:23:05,290 --> 01:23:07,840
columbus catholic school girl.
so I went to catholic school.

1939
01:23:07,841 --> 01:23:09,040
So yeah,
talk to us.

1940
01:23:09,810 --> 01:23:13,590
Tell us some of them.
Uh,

1941
01:23:13,900 --> 01:23:14,460
jay?
Yeah.

1942
01:23:14,460 --> 01:23:16,060
Be nice.
What?

1943
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:18,610
They weren't on their jumpers.
Sometimes they had shorts on.

1944
01:23:18,611 --> 01:23:19,444
Sometimes they did,
but there was a marked difference 

1945
01:23:22,991 --> 01:23:23,824
suppression right?
between catholic school girls and 

1946
01:23:25,541 --> 01:23:26,580
regular girls.
Yep.

1947
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:27,633
Yeah.
Well I mean the public school girls 

1948
01:23:28,481 --> 01:23:28,951
around me.
Wait,

1949
01:23:28,951 --> 01:23:30,140
what is it?
A whole different thing.

1950
01:23:30,141 --> 01:23:31,870
So most of them are private school rules
for.

1951
01:23:31,870 --> 01:23:33,340
I was at.
So the biggest freak,

1952
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:36,040
the dated during my high school years 
was a girl.

1953
01:23:36,050 --> 01:23:39,250
It was a wonderful girl,
but she went to an all girl catholic.

1954
01:23:39,251 --> 01:23:41,050
Of course she was suppressed completely.
Yup.

1955
01:23:41,340 --> 01:23:42,173
Yup.
So when you hold someone in a cage like 

1956
01:23:43,241 --> 01:23:44,370
that,
what do you think is gonna happen?

1957
01:23:44,440 --> 01:23:45,273
It's like,
of course when they get out they get 

1958
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:50,140
wild and go nuts.
Scrub was nuts,

1959
01:23:50,141 --> 01:23:51,460
man.
she was wild.

1960
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:52,301
But that's.
But that's.

1961
01:23:52,301 --> 01:23:54,790
So that's what I'm saying no one wants 
to talk about.

1962
01:23:55,210 --> 01:23:56,043
And again,
I'm not trying to dive into kevin all 

1963
01:23:57,020 --> 01:23:59,380
bullshit,
but people are young and they do fucking

1964
01:23:59,381 --> 01:24:00,214
crazy shit when you are hormonally at 
your beginnings and you're confused and 

1965
01:24:04,901 --> 01:24:05,711
weird.
I mean,

1966
01:24:05,711 --> 01:24:08,710
guys know when guys start masturbating.
It's this disgusting,

1967
01:24:08,711 --> 01:24:09,730
weird,
secret,

1968
01:24:09,790 --> 01:24:11,020
creepy,
gross,

1969
01:24:11,170 --> 01:24:12,003
sAd,
like undercover secret that you don't 

1970
01:24:14,201 --> 01:24:16,500
tell your friends and your pants off.

1971
01:24:16,590 --> 01:24:20,040
So and all of that is swirling inside 
your head over sexuality.

1972
01:24:20,050 --> 01:24:21,670
Then when you do get a chance with a 
girl,

1973
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:23,260
it's uncomfortable.
It's awkward.

1974
01:24:23,261 --> 01:24:24,190
It's weird.
Again,

1975
01:24:24,230 --> 01:24:25,810
not talking about whatever fucking he 
did.

1976
01:24:25,811 --> 01:24:26,644
I'm just saying you're already in this 
weird state of men are fucked up when 

1977
01:24:30,701 --> 01:24:31,534
they're sexually reaching this new peak 
Of their life that they just want to 

1978
01:24:34,181 --> 01:24:35,014
like jerk off and come and fucking.
And how much information are they 

1979
01:24:37,181 --> 01:24:38,920
getting from their parents?
Zero.

1980
01:24:38,980 --> 01:24:40,560
Almost none.
Almost none.

1981
01:24:40,570 --> 01:24:41,440
Almost.
That's the thing.

1982
01:24:41,441 --> 01:24:45,010
How much guidance.
So the rule is you don't understand.

1983
01:24:45,100 --> 01:24:48,340
And also our society perpetuates if you 
want to be real fucking honest.

1984
01:24:48,341 --> 01:24:52,180
Our society perpetuates this weird pull 
and push of like,

1985
01:24:52,670 --> 01:24:53,351
you know,
no,

1986
01:24:53,351 --> 01:24:54,340
I don't want,
you know,

1987
01:24:54,420 --> 01:24:56,320
that fucking song baby.
It's cold outside,

1988
01:24:56,650 --> 01:24:57,483
you know that.
How the christmas song a baby just stay 

1989
01:24:59,261 --> 01:25:01,150
for a really should go.

1990
01:25:01,150 --> 01:25:03,130
It's cold outside.
It's a christmas fucking song.

1991
01:25:03,850 --> 01:25:04,683
You know what it is?
Jamie knows what the fuck I'm talking 

1992
01:25:05,651 --> 01:25:06,011
about.
Yeah,

1993
01:25:06,011 --> 01:25:06,950
you do.
Sure.

1994
01:25:07,150 --> 01:25:09,130
It's a christmas song and it's called 
baby.

1995
01:25:09,131 --> 01:25:10,840
It's cold outside.
But christmas song about rape.

1996
01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:12,040
So was a hundred percent.
It is.

1997
01:25:12,270 --> 01:25:13,920
No,
I'm dead serious here.

1998
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:16,360
He's playing it.
Didn't play it on youtube or will get in

1999
01:25:16,361 --> 01:25:17,194
trouble.
Really can't stay is an old to see if I 

2000
01:25:20,221 --> 01:25:20,960
can find her.
Oh,

2001
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:21,731
so.
Oh,

2002
01:25:21,731 --> 01:25:25,900
I do know the song she sang.
I got to go home.

2003
01:25:25,901 --> 01:25:27,670
My parents are going to say the whole 
time he's like,

2004
01:25:27,671 --> 01:25:28,930
come on,
just have one more drink.

2005
01:25:28,931 --> 01:25:32,260
Just to stay out a little bit longer.
He's trying to fucking louver up.

2006
01:25:32,290 --> 01:25:33,580
Yes.
And by the way,

2007
01:25:33,610 --> 01:25:37,030
terrible staying at the end because she,
she wants to be with him the game.

2008
01:25:37,090 --> 01:25:37,923
Right.
So the thing that nobody wants to 

2009
01:25:38,981 --> 01:25:40,780
fucking talk about at all.
And I'm not.

2010
01:25:40,810 --> 01:25:41,643
Again,
I'm not fucking saying anything other 

2011
01:25:43,151 --> 01:25:45,010
than this is a perpetuation of our 
culture.

2012
01:25:45,011 --> 01:25:45,844
For a long time of pull and taken teas,
tease is a game that women play and men 

2013
01:25:50,111 --> 01:25:51,670
play to have like,
you know,

2014
01:25:51,671 --> 01:25:53,410
look at it.
I really can't say it's cold outside.

2015
01:25:53,850 --> 01:25:57,070
Got to go away this evening.
It has been a so very nice.

2016
01:25:57,071 --> 01:25:59,740
My mother will start to worry.
My father will be pacing the floor.

2017
01:25:59,741 --> 01:26:00,340
I'd read,
I read.

2018
01:26:00,340 --> 01:26:04,040
I read a really better scurry.
Maybe just a half a drink more.

2019
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:09,040
That's her finally admitting the 
neighbors might think what you say.

2020
01:26:09,231 --> 01:26:11,000
What's in this drink?
Ah,

2021
01:26:11,001 --> 01:26:12,800
you're very pushy.
You know,

2022
01:26:13,130 --> 01:26:17,060
I like to think of it as opportunistic.
I simply must go.

2023
01:26:17,061 --> 01:26:19,820
The answer is no.
The welcome has been so nice and warm.

2024
01:26:19,821 --> 01:26:22,210
My sister will be suspicious.
My brother will be there at the door and

2025
01:26:22,211 --> 01:26:26,550
my maidens aren't made is vicious.
We'll maybe just a cigarette more so now

2026
01:26:26,690 --> 01:26:27,201
she's like,
no,

2027
01:26:27,201 --> 01:26:27,450
no,
no,

2028
01:26:27,450 --> 01:26:28,330
no.
Yeah,

2029
01:26:28,450 --> 01:26:28,830
no,
no,

2030
01:26:28,830 --> 01:26:29,780
no.
Yeah.

2031
01:26:30,140 --> 01:26:32,540
Oh god.
Okay,

2032
01:26:32,541 --> 01:26:33,950
fine.
Another drink then.

2033
01:26:34,130 --> 01:26:36,710
That took a lot of convincing.
Okay.

2034
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:39,230
That's the last word that took a lot of 
convincing.

2035
01:26:39,290 --> 01:26:40,680
Yes.
Oh weird.

2036
01:26:40,820 --> 01:26:42,950
So what I'm saying it that shit.
Oh my god.

2037
01:26:42,951 --> 01:26:45,470
This got to be the 1,940
forties,

2038
01:26:45,471 --> 01:26:49,520
maybe people just rape 50 slash 50 to 50
2:52

2039
01:26:49,521 --> 01:26:50,880
now,
but he wasn't the original 44.

2040
01:26:51,110 --> 01:26:55,190
My point is this shit has been going on 
forever and it's fucking real and nobody

2041
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:57,320
wants nothing to do with the cabinet 
thing.

2042
01:26:57,320 --> 01:26:58,153
Right,
and here's the thing about the cabinet 

2043
01:26:58,790 --> 01:27:00,020
thing.
You know what I mean by that?

2044
01:27:00,090 --> 01:27:00,923
No,
I didn't know,

2045
01:27:00,970 --> 01:27:01,803
but here's the thing.
Even the fact that you have to be 

2046
01:27:03,051 --> 01:27:04,550
defensive right there.
Everybody has to go.

2047
01:27:04,630 --> 01:27:06,220
This is what I'm saying.
What I'm saying.

2048
01:27:06,470 --> 01:27:07,610
I'm not supporting rape.
I'm not.

2049
01:27:07,780 --> 01:27:08,613
Or even discussing it.
All people are ready to fucking hit you 

2050
01:27:10,911 --> 01:27:11,690
in the head.
well,

2051
01:27:11,690 --> 01:27:15,950
of course there's no conversation to be.
There's a woman who had a brutal take on

2052
01:27:15,951 --> 01:27:16,880
it.
A brutal.

2053
01:27:17,930 --> 01:27:18,763
There's two ways we can look at this.
There's a woman who had a really brutal 

2054
01:27:21,201 --> 01:27:22,280
take on this,
leah,

2055
01:27:22,281 --> 01:27:25,610
that was on Jordan peterson's a twitter 
page.

2056
01:27:25,790 --> 01:27:27,770
If you go to Jordan peterson's twitter 
page,

2057
01:27:28,010 --> 01:27:32,630
there's a woman who is a.
I don't know what she does,

2058
01:27:32,631 --> 01:27:33,464
but she talks about how this woman who 
was aCcusing brett kavanaugh goes to 

2059
01:27:38,631 --> 01:27:40,250
this predominantly.

2060
01:27:40,360 --> 01:27:43,250
She teaches at this predominantly 
women's college,

2061
01:27:43,251 --> 01:27:45,320
were 79 percent of the students are 
women.

2062
01:27:45,740 --> 01:27:46,573
The majority,
the vast majority of the professors are 

2063
01:27:48,351 --> 01:27:49,184
women and social justice is the number 
one thing that they promoted the school 

2064
01:27:54,530 --> 01:27:55,363
ahead of education of everything.
When you look at the schools like list 

2065
01:27:58,221 --> 01:27:59,054
of like what it aims to accomplish and 
how to educate the students like 

2066
01:28:02,630 --> 01:28:05,930
promoting social justice is one of the 
primary things.

2067
01:28:05,931 --> 01:28:06,764
IT's the first one above everything else
and the idea is that why would this 

2068
01:28:11,631 --> 01:28:12,464
woman risk everything and with this 
woman's take is who's criticizing this 

2069
01:28:16,820 --> 01:28:19,850
is that she's not risking anything.
She's rewarded from this.

2070
01:28:20,130 --> 01:28:20,963
Her culture,
this is a big deal and she's very 

2071
01:28:23,271 --> 01:28:24,470
cynical about this.
She's like,

2072
01:28:24,471 --> 01:28:27,770
this woman has no recollection.
Doesn't remember how she got home,

2073
01:28:27,771 --> 01:28:28,604
doesn't remember where the party was,
but does remember that someone may have 

2074
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:35,490
tried to do something to her.
You know,

2075
01:28:35,870 --> 01:28:36,703
I'm noT a big fan of,
of criticizing people who come out and 

2076
01:28:39,531 --> 01:28:43,310
say someone did something to them or try
to do something because you don't know.

2077
01:28:43,550 --> 01:28:45,750
You don't know you're on the outside 
looking in and you're,

2078
01:28:45,751 --> 01:28:46,584
you're,
you're trying to pick holes in their 

2079
01:28:47,271 --> 01:28:49,880
story.
I don't even know if they know because I

2080
01:28:49,881 --> 01:28:50,714
don't.
I don't.

2081
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:52,770
here it is.
Yeah.

2082
01:28:53,450 --> 01:28:54,283
If you click on the video,
you can hear some of what this woman 

2083
01:28:57,471 --> 01:29:01,590
says like click on it and play some with
this one says we don't have to,

2084
01:29:02,260 --> 01:29:03,093
notably by the lifelong friend who 
supposedly accompanied blazzy forward 

2085
01:29:06,911 --> 01:29:09,130
and presumably might have noticed.

2086
01:29:09,930 --> 01:29:11,780
It sounds like Jordan Peterson.
Celtic.

2087
01:29:11,790 --> 01:29:14,190
I can play that actually probably get 
kicked off.

2088
01:29:14,890 --> 01:29:16,090
Okay.
But the,

2089
01:29:16,170 --> 01:29:16,520
the,
the,

2090
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:17,353
the point is that like there's only two 
people that know what really happened 

2091
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:20,820
and they don't even know what really 
happened.

2092
01:29:20,910 --> 01:29:21,743
Well,
you're talking about something that 

2093
01:29:22,921 --> 01:29:26,250
happened 35 fucking years ago.
I mean if he,

2094
01:29:26,310 --> 01:29:29,670
if she said thirtY five years ago,
this guy raped me.

2095
01:29:30,090 --> 01:29:31,620
Okay.
That's a different story.

2096
01:29:31,680 --> 01:29:32,160
Well,
yeah.

2097
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:32,690
Well,
yeah,

2098
01:29:32,690 --> 01:29:34,410
but this is not what she's saying.
Right.

2099
01:29:34,411 --> 01:29:36,000
What iS she saying?
My.

2100
01:29:36,030 --> 01:29:37,920
From what I understood,
and by the way,

2101
01:29:37,921 --> 01:29:39,920
this is something I distanced myself 
from because I was just.

2102
01:29:39,930 --> 01:29:41,490
It was so overwhelming that I was like,
oh god,

2103
01:29:41,820 --> 01:29:42,653
that he held her down while the other 
dude was in the room and he kind of 

2104
01:29:45,451 --> 01:29:50,451
helped him held to older down and he had
his penis on her or did he.

2105
01:29:51,240 --> 01:29:54,600
Is that what he's saying?
Let's find this because people got super

2106
01:29:54,601 --> 01:29:55,950
mad and we talKed about this the other 
day,

2107
01:29:55,951 --> 01:29:58,380
like you should have done research for.
You discussed a predator.

2108
01:29:58,480 --> 01:30:00,200
Might as well.
See,

2109
01:30:00,230 --> 01:30:02,340
that's what's impOrtant.
First of all,

2110
01:30:02,341 --> 01:30:05,130
I'm not supporting him anyway.
I'm not standing there.

2111
01:30:05,160 --> 01:30:05,993
None of the either none of us,
but that's the thing is like when you 

2112
01:30:07,891 --> 01:30:09,030
talk about it,
someone goes,

2113
01:30:09,590 --> 01:30:11,100
what do you.
What are you In favor of him?

2114
01:30:11,220 --> 01:30:12,053
Exactly.
The you have to have a conversation 

2115
01:30:14,191 --> 01:30:15,680
about what's going on.
Otherwise I'm just,

2116
01:30:15,710 --> 01:30:16,543
I'm just numb.
This is a giant platform and then if 

2117
01:30:18,901 --> 01:30:21,180
we're discussing in this giant platform,
we should be informed.

2118
01:30:21,181 --> 01:30:22,014
I disagree with that because I think 
that we're just having a conversation 

2119
01:30:24,630 --> 01:30:25,463
about something you just happen to be 
privy to this conversation because I'm 

2120
01:30:28,171 --> 01:30:29,004
not pretending I'm some sort of an 
export or that I have some sort of 

2121
01:30:31,351 --> 01:30:34,650
information that you don't know that if 
you have those misconceptions,

2122
01:30:34,651 --> 01:30:35,730
let me clear those up right now.

2123
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:36,713
I'm a fucking moron talking to another 
more on next to another three more 

2124
01:30:40,621 --> 01:30:42,980
rounds in this room.
They're all dudes talking.

2125
01:30:42,981 --> 01:30:44,850
Okay.
You don't know jack shit.

2126
01:30:44,860 --> 01:30:46,080
Nah,
I know what I.

2127
01:30:46,200 --> 01:30:47,820
I know.
I know my feeling of the whole thing.

2128
01:30:47,821 --> 01:30:51,090
I know the feeling of the whole thing is
that no matter what anybody,

2129
01:30:51,750 --> 01:30:54,740
it's kinda like a what got in trouble 
for norm.

2130
01:30:55,180 --> 01:30:59,970
Norm mcdonald got in trouble no matter 
what I think are suffering in a bad,

2131
01:30:59,971 --> 01:31:00,721
bad way.
Okay.

2132
01:31:00,721 --> 01:31:01,560
Here,
what it says here,

2133
01:31:02,630 --> 01:31:03,463
it was sure with the most explosive and 
surreal confirmation hearing since 

2134
01:31:05,191 --> 01:31:06,024
clarence thomas and anita hill in 1991 
nominee for the supreme court was asked 

2135
01:31:09,390 --> 01:31:10,223
if he was a gang rapist and a blackout 
drunk while defending himself by 

2136
01:31:13,651 --> 01:31:17,670
describing how long he preserved his 
virginity,

2137
01:31:18,090 --> 01:31:22,110
his accuser described him grinding,
covering her mouth,

2138
01:31:22,111 --> 01:31:22,944
covering her mouth,
and fearing that he was accidentally 

2139
01:31:25,831 --> 01:31:26,664
going to kill me.

2140
01:31:26,850 --> 01:31:28,770
Okay,
well that's pretty fucking serious.

2141
01:31:28,860 --> 01:31:31,860
So if he was,
if he was covering her mouth Because she

2142
01:31:31,861 --> 01:31:35,220
was protesting and he was grinding in 
her right?

2143
01:31:35,250 --> 01:31:36,750
Some pretty dark shit.
Fuck yeah.

2144
01:31:36,780 --> 01:31:38,610
So that,
that's gone down a little bit.

2145
01:31:38,640 --> 01:31:39,990
Yeah.
Keep scrolling down please.

2146
01:31:40,740 --> 01:31:41,850
I'm Ms.
Hill.

2147
01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:42,713
Twenty seven years ago,
dr blazey a psychology professor in 

2148
01:31:44,251 --> 01:31:47,340
California treated gingerly and the 
republicans who feared,

2149
01:31:47,341 --> 01:31:48,210
okay,
this is blah blah blah,

2150
01:31:48,211 --> 01:31:48,810
blah blah.
But,

2151
01:31:48,810 --> 01:31:49,390
but,
but that.

2152
01:31:49,390 --> 01:31:50,280
Okay.
So that was a.

2153
01:31:50,450 --> 01:31:51,283
She became a very human being,
telling a terrible story about judge 

2154
01:31:53,581 --> 01:31:56,100
kevin on compelling terms that brought 
many women to tiers,

2155
01:31:56,130 --> 01:31:58,650
transformed the battle for the supreme 
court.

2156
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:01,990
Okay.
Well see that's all I needed to hear.

2157
01:32:02,070 --> 01:32:04,900
See that,
that the kind of person.

2158
01:32:05,530 --> 01:32:07,030
Now look,
I don't know if he did this,

2159
01:32:07,510 --> 01:32:11,560
but if he did do this,
the kind of person that covers a woman's

2160
01:32:11,561 --> 01:32:12,400
mouth.
Yeah,

2161
01:32:12,401 --> 01:32:15,400
that's crazy shit.
That's an extra level of darkness.

2162
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:16,353
You're not like trying to kiss her and 
against each other covering someone's 

2163
01:32:20,441 --> 01:32:21,340
mouth.
Right?

2164
01:32:21,341 --> 01:32:23,290
That's right.
But if he really did that,

2165
01:32:23,860 --> 01:32:24,611
yeah,
that's what I'm saying.

2166
01:32:24,611 --> 01:32:26,080
If it's all true,
that's what that is.

2167
01:32:26,110 --> 01:32:27,820
That's him trying to hold her back from 
something.

2168
01:32:28,330 --> 01:32:28,990
So,
uh,

2169
01:32:28,990 --> 01:32:31,890
Donald Trump said this,
uh,

2170
01:32:32,140 --> 01:32:35,110
you know,
this famous quote that it's a tough time

2171
01:32:35,111 --> 01:32:35,944
for boys.

2172
01:32:37,950 --> 01:32:38,783
So girl made a song.
I've heard that song song is actually 

2173
01:32:42,731 --> 01:32:43,564
very great song.
It's a good song and I'm going to tweet 

2174
01:32:46,091 --> 01:32:46,924
it,
but I'm like,

2175
01:32:47,010 --> 01:32:50,140
when I was about to tweet and my people 
are going to get so fucking mad at me,

2176
01:32:50,670 --> 01:32:54,910
um,
her name is on twitter,

2177
01:32:54,911 --> 01:32:58,360
it's mercedes,
l y n z.

2178
01:32:58,361 --> 01:33:02,290
SHe has a beautiful voice and the song 
is,

2179
01:33:03,070 --> 01:33:05,870
it's a scary time for dues.
Scary time for.

2180
01:33:05,990 --> 01:33:07,480
Yeah.
I listened to it a few times.

2181
01:33:07,481 --> 01:33:09,550
it's really good.
Maybe we could play a little bit of it.

2182
01:33:10,420 --> 01:33:13,190
Can we play a little bit over?
We get kicked off of youtube now.

2183
01:33:13,790 --> 01:33:15,910
Jamie's just shaking and shaking his 
fucking head.

2184
01:33:16,390 --> 01:33:19,580
Just that it would get tagged because 
I'm sure she's trying to monetize.

2185
01:33:19,670 --> 01:33:22,090
She's probably got a billion views.
So anyway,

2186
01:33:22,091 --> 01:33:24,070
her twitter page.
Listen,

2187
01:33:25,090 --> 01:33:27,010
this is the thing.
Men in particular,

2188
01:33:27,011 --> 01:33:28,120
you're going to hear this.
You go,

2189
01:33:28,121 --> 01:33:30,180
oh,
you fucking support news every time,

2190
01:33:30,210 --> 01:33:32,350
man.
Fucking male bashing shit.

2191
01:33:32,530 --> 01:33:33,610
Give me just give me a little volume.

2192
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:41,020
I can't go to chaperone.
I can't wait.

2193
01:33:42,120 --> 01:33:43,650
The only one I own.

2194
01:33:44,440 --> 01:33:46,040
Yeah.
Look,

2195
01:33:46,330 --> 01:33:47,163
it's.
She's just going on about how difficult 

2196
01:33:49,911 --> 01:33:54,020
it is to be a girl and when you're not a
girl,

2197
01:33:54,260 --> 01:33:57,350
it's not something you consider and so 
all these guys

2198
01:33:58,250 --> 01:33:59,140
truth.
She's like,

2199
01:33:59,141 --> 01:33:59,974
I can't live on the first floor.
I can't just leave my window open at 

2200
01:34:01,871 --> 01:34:03,670
night.
Like all these things are fucking very,

2201
01:34:03,671 --> 01:34:04,440
very true.

2202
01:34:04,440 --> 01:34:06,690
It's a good song and she's got a great 
voice.

2203
01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:08,950
Listen,
this is the.

2204
01:34:08,990 --> 01:34:10,260
This is the whole thing that I think 
we're.

2205
01:34:10,310 --> 01:34:11,143
We're talking about.
You're allowed to see to see truth on 

2206
01:34:14,810 --> 01:34:15,643
all sides of all of these issues.
I don't think you ever have to be so 

2207
01:34:17,931 --> 01:34:18,764
staunch about anything.
I disagree with people that are so 

2208
01:34:20,481 --> 01:34:23,240
staunch about just being like,
this is the end of the discussion.

2209
01:34:23,270 --> 01:34:24,650
You're only this way or not.
It's like,

2210
01:34:24,890 --> 01:34:26,930
no man,
I don't know all the stories.

2211
01:34:26,931 --> 01:34:29,050
I don't know all the truths of,
of the cabin.

2212
01:34:29,051 --> 01:34:29,884
All bullshit.
I don't know all the truths of anything 

2213
01:34:31,310 --> 01:34:32,143
that woman coming forward.
I tend to believe a woman that's gonna 

2214
01:34:34,760 --> 01:34:36,890
go out of her way.
I don't think she's looking for fame.

2215
01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:38,570
I don't think any of the girls that came
out from louis,

2216
01:34:38,571 --> 01:34:39,404
we're looking for fame and attention to 
one wants attention to have their name 

2217
01:34:41,871 --> 01:34:44,150
googled and come up with this for the 
rest of their life.

2218
01:34:44,300 --> 01:34:46,430
So I wouldn't say that.
I see.

2219
01:34:46,431 --> 01:34:47,720
I don't,
I wouldn't say no one.

2220
01:34:47,820 --> 01:34:51,830
I think most people don't want that kind
of.

2221
01:34:51,860 --> 01:34:52,990
Okay.
We don't know what,

2222
01:34:53,010 --> 01:34:53,880
you know.
Okay.

2223
01:34:53,890 --> 01:34:55,280
You know,
who doesn't want that kind of attention?

2224
01:34:56,150 --> 01:34:57,920
The psychopaths.
But the donald truMp,

2225
01:34:57,960 --> 01:34:58,150
uh,

2226
01:34:58,150 --> 01:34:59,520
what's her name?
The fucking porch talking.

2227
01:34:59,580 --> 01:35:00,413
Okay.
Yeah,

2228
01:35:00,740 --> 01:35:02,630
I think she all she wanted was 
attention.

2229
01:35:02,631 --> 01:35:03,800
I'm sorry.
I'm like,

2230
01:35:03,890 --> 01:35:05,600
well,
she thought the guy consensually and all

2231
01:35:05,601 --> 01:35:08,240
she did was make fun of his penis.
Like she wants money.

2232
01:35:08,270 --> 01:35:08,940
Yeah,
no shit.

2233
01:35:08,940 --> 01:35:09,773
Okay.
He's making money from it and she's in 

2234
01:35:11,421 --> 01:35:13,880
her forties and she's still stripping.
It's fucking sad.

2235
01:35:13,910 --> 01:35:17,390
It's not like a zelda when Dr.
Ford and these other women,

2236
01:35:17,450 --> 01:35:18,980
they're not doing it for the fucking 
attend.

2237
01:35:19,010 --> 01:35:19,880
They don't.
She doesn't want.

2238
01:35:19,940 --> 01:35:20,773
She's doing that because there is a 
truth in there of what happened and I 

2239
01:35:22,341 --> 01:35:23,840
believe that.
I don't know what it is,

2240
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:24,793
but I believe there's something fucked 
up that went down and unfortunately we 

2241
01:35:28,191 --> 01:35:30,330
are in the middle of this.
What,

2242
01:35:30,500 --> 01:35:31,780
what can be done?
Who,

2243
01:35:31,820 --> 01:35:33,140
who knows?
How do we.

2244
01:35:33,740 --> 01:35:37,520
There is no physical evidence or rape or
gray area,

2245
01:35:37,521 --> 01:35:38,450
like what am I supposed to do?

2246
01:35:38,530 --> 01:35:39,363
This offices,
this deep understanding of the flaws of 

2247
01:35:41,691 --> 01:35:43,490
the human memory.
Both his and her.

2248
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:45,380
Totally.
When you're dealing with 35 years ago,

2249
01:35:45,381 --> 01:35:47,310
if you tried to ask me,
you know,

2250
01:35:47,330 --> 01:35:48,163
what happened when you and this girl 
will make it out in the backseat of a 

2251
01:35:50,331 --> 01:35:52,400
car 35 years ago.
Good luck.

2252
01:35:52,730 --> 01:35:55,130
I,
I don't know if this is a few moments.

2253
01:35:55,131 --> 01:35:55,821
I remember.
I don't know.

2254
01:35:55,821 --> 01:35:56,654
It was me and it was amazing by that.
I don't fucking know have to remember 

2255
01:36:00,291 --> 01:36:02,120
like very few sexual encounters from 
high school,

2256
01:36:02,121 --> 01:36:04,640
but I remember my girlfriend,
but I know that was consensual.

2257
01:36:04,670 --> 01:36:07,400
Yes,
they're all central girlfriend gave me a

2258
01:36:07,401 --> 01:36:10,940
blowjob on the porch and I came so hard 
in my ears rang and it's never happened.

2259
01:36:12,260 --> 01:36:15,320
Never happened since.
Peaked when I was 16 years old.

2260
01:36:15,780 --> 01:36:17,180
I'm not.
It's so hard.

2261
01:36:17,181 --> 01:36:22,181
It was like literally my you remember 
doesn't blow job you've ever had.

2262
01:36:22,730 --> 01:36:24,860
I wasn't beating off back then.
I was,

2263
01:36:24,950 --> 01:36:28,370
I actually had sex before I jerked off.
Shut the fuck up.

2264
01:36:28,550 --> 01:36:29,810
Real id.
Yeah,

2265
01:36:29,870 --> 01:36:30,703
I did.
And it's not like I had sex real young 

2266
01:36:31,941 --> 01:36:33,230
either.
How old were you when you,

2267
01:36:33,231 --> 01:36:36,110
when you first thought?
I think I was 16.

2268
01:36:36,230 --> 01:36:37,100
How old were you,
jamie?

2269
01:36:37,610 --> 01:36:39,860
nine.
Fuck machine,

2270
01:36:39,970 --> 01:36:42,790
he's it.
I'm looking at it with a nut case.

2271
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:48,000
That cancer next shirt.
Not king in catholic school.

2272
01:36:50,241 --> 01:36:53,270
Just lifting up skirts and just send 
that at home.

2273
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:57,290
Oh,
biggest dick over at st peter's.

2274
01:36:57,960 --> 01:36:59,780
That's right.
No,

2275
01:36:59,781 --> 01:37:00,710
seriously.
How old were you?

2276
01:37:00,740 --> 01:37:01,730
Do you know?
17.

2277
01:37:02,120 --> 01:37:02,811
16,
17.

2278
01:37:02,811 --> 01:37:05,220
That's right.
That's the average ages man with biggest

2279
01:37:08,400 --> 01:37:10,720
guys balls.
That's the real nutcase.

2280
01:37:10,760 --> 01:37:11,593
Poor bastard.
There's a bunch of those guys to get 

2281
01:37:13,131 --> 01:37:14,690
elephant titus.
Have the balls.

2282
01:37:15,020 --> 01:37:17,090
I guess they just don't want to get 
their balls cut off.

2283
01:37:20,060 --> 01:37:24,240
That looks like a halloween costume to 
say.

2284
01:37:24,680 --> 01:37:27,590
But there's some,
some men who really do have those,

2285
01:37:27,591 --> 01:37:29,180
but luckily that guy,
that guy's naked.

2286
01:37:29,390 --> 01:37:30,530
That's a sack.
Wait a minute.

2287
01:37:30,531 --> 01:37:32,330
So take me you fuck before you ever 
joked on.

2288
01:37:32,350 --> 01:37:33,040
Yeah,
I did.

2289
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:33,411
And,
and,

2290
01:37:33,411 --> 01:37:34,040
and,
and,

2291
01:37:34,040 --> 01:37:36,230
and,
and so then when you jerked off,

2292
01:37:36,231 --> 01:37:38,750
which I don't recommend because I had 
zero control,

2293
01:37:38,760 --> 01:37:40,180
just going to say we stuck it in,
be like,

2294
01:37:40,490 --> 01:37:43,650
yikes.
I mean,

2295
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:44,330
I've,
I,

2296
01:37:44,330 --> 01:37:46,260
I,
the first time I had sex without,

2297
01:37:46,370 --> 01:37:50,120
without like raw without a condom was,
was my brain was like,

2298
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:52,010
all right,
there's a strategy to this.

2299
01:37:52,011 --> 01:37:54,260
You've got to be able to last look out 
the window.

2300
01:37:54,410 --> 01:37:56,080
The moment it was just like,
yeah.

2301
01:37:56,180 --> 01:37:59,370
The first time I ever orgasm was a girl 
jerking me off.

2302
01:37:59,970 --> 01:38:00,980
Fuck.
Yeah.

2303
01:38:01,140 --> 01:38:04,350
Well I guess mine was gene's robin.
Mine was a dry humping.

2304
01:38:04,470 --> 01:38:05,640
Jamie,
you did a bunch of that shit.

2305
01:38:05,670 --> 01:38:06,503
You dry hump from dry humping.
I probably had like a little bit my 

2306
01:38:09,991 --> 01:38:10,870
underwear,
you know,

2307
01:38:10,910 --> 01:38:12,470
like I used to have a bit about that.
Like,

2308
01:38:12,770 --> 01:38:13,603
like you ever take your underwear off 
and this is a stream of sperm that 

2309
01:38:16,441 --> 01:38:18,330
somehow or other from the tip of your 
dick to your underwear.

2310
01:38:18,331 --> 01:38:19,560
Like,
what the fuck is this?

2311
01:38:19,820 --> 01:38:20,653
I go,
that's those green baret sperm deliver 

2312
01:38:22,160 --> 01:38:24,210
on the tip of your dick with a knife in 
their mouth.

2313
01:38:24,211 --> 01:38:26,100
I don't give a fuck about your plans for
the future.

2314
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:27,233
Those are the ones that get people 
pregnant because they just wanted to go 

2315
01:38:29,700 --> 01:38:34,700
ready to go get the underwear.
Fuck pussy.

2316
01:38:35,371 --> 01:38:36,900
Let's go there.
Over zealous,

2317
01:38:37,380 --> 01:38:38,213
zealous,
they hit that underwear because 

2318
01:38:39,271 --> 01:38:41,160
sometimes you find pre-cum in your 
underwear.

2319
01:38:41,161 --> 01:38:42,060
You're like,
what is this?

2320
01:38:42,540 --> 01:38:44,610
What's happening here?
Pre-cum is the strongest come.

2321
01:38:44,640 --> 01:38:46,230
That is the.
That is the most potent.

2322
01:38:46,290 --> 01:38:48,180
Yeah,
that's the most potent savages.

2323
01:38:48,450 --> 01:38:50,370
The hordes,
barbarian hordes,

2324
01:38:51,890 --> 01:38:54,680
fucking swords and shit.
Pre-cum is the,

2325
01:38:54,940 --> 01:38:55,773
what is it?
The green berets or whatever like that 

2326
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:01,440
because my regular comments like the 
navy reserves?

2327
01:39:01,650 --> 01:39:03,330
Yeah,
like coast guard.

2328
01:39:05,300 --> 01:39:07,530
They might come out.
You guys got to make it.

2329
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:11,820
Not the disrespect that coast guard 
blank you boys,

2330
01:39:11,850 --> 01:39:12,683
but yeah man.
I mean I didn't get any birds and the 

2331
01:39:16,351 --> 01:39:18,250
bees talk.
Did you watch?

2332
01:39:18,390 --> 01:39:20,310
Not even remotely.
What the fuck?

2333
01:39:20,700 --> 01:39:23,340
Parents?
No fucking way was trying to think.

2334
01:39:23,341 --> 01:39:24,900
I don't think they even really did it in
school.

2335
01:39:25,340 --> 01:39:30,120
Maybe just like student teachers.
I didn't get shit.

2336
01:39:30,180 --> 01:39:31,013
Do you want to know when I got my.
This is my father embarrassed the shit 

2337
01:39:33,721 --> 01:39:34,554
out of me.
I don't know if I've told this on this 

2338
01:39:35,221 --> 01:39:36,054
thing,
but the most embarrassing thing my 

2339
01:39:36,810 --> 01:39:37,643
father did to me.
We were eating dinner when I first 

2340
01:39:38,581 --> 01:39:40,710
started jerking off and figuring it out 
and shit.

2341
01:39:40,740 --> 01:39:44,220
You know,
my dad at dinner in front of my whole,

2342
01:39:44,250 --> 01:39:45,960
my family,
my dad was like,

2343
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:48,240
you've been spending a lot of time in 
the bathroom,

2344
01:39:48,450 --> 01:39:49,740
and my mom was like,
hey,

2345
01:39:50,460 --> 01:39:51,293
stop it.

2346
01:39:53,730 --> 01:39:54,563
And I was like,
these motherfuckers had been talking 

2347
01:39:56,851 --> 01:39:57,684
about me.
They know I'm jerking off and they've 

2348
01:39:58,711 --> 01:40:02,160
had multiple conversations.
I know it must be whacking off again,

2349
01:40:02,161 --> 01:40:03,820
that little fucking horn ball because I 
would,

2350
01:40:03,870 --> 01:40:05,650
I would lock the door and go in the 
bathroom.

2351
01:40:05,790 --> 01:40:08,250
I got a stomach ache if my mother ever 
said to embarrass you,

2352
01:40:08,370 --> 01:40:09,240
you,
oh my god.

2353
01:40:09,241 --> 01:40:11,670
In front of my fucking inside my sisters
there.

2354
01:40:11,671 --> 01:40:12,680
I was like,
oh my god.

2355
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:13,860
And my mom was like,
hey,

2356
01:40:14,070 --> 01:40:15,330
like that.
And my dad was like,

2357
01:40:15,331 --> 01:40:16,260
oh no,
nothing,

2358
01:40:16,261 --> 01:40:18,260
nothing.
And I just knew it was him taking that.

2359
01:40:18,450 --> 01:40:23,010
You know what it was now as a man,
like I know that to my son.

2360
01:40:23,040 --> 01:40:25,230
I'll take a shot like that too.
It was just a guy shooting.

2361
01:40:25,420 --> 01:40:27,390
But you would tell your son.
I know,

2362
01:40:27,391 --> 01:40:29,310
but I would shit on them a little bit 
too because that was funny.

2363
01:40:29,430 --> 01:40:30,930
It was funny.
It was very funny.

2364
01:40:30,931 --> 01:40:31,764
In retrospect it was like,
like he bought me a kathy Ireland 

2365
01:40:33,271 --> 01:40:34,740
poster.
Do you remember kathy Ireland?

2366
01:40:35,490 --> 01:40:36,900
He bought me a kathy Ireland poster and 
he was like,

2367
01:40:36,901 --> 01:40:38,760
don't.
And he said something along the lines of

2368
01:40:38,761 --> 01:40:41,790
like,
a don't let this get stuck together.

2369
01:40:41,791 --> 01:40:42,790
And I was like,
ooh,

2370
01:40:43,350 --> 01:40:44,183
but I know he's just a fucking jerk off 
out in your room with kathy Ireland 

2371
01:40:48,691 --> 01:40:49,111
posts.
Well,

2372
01:40:49,111 --> 01:40:51,510
because I used to love her.
I thought she was gorgeous.

2373
01:40:52,240 --> 01:40:54,220
She's still one of those chicks.
It's hanging

2374
01:40:54,220 --> 01:40:58,540
in there and like she was my.
She was my ultimate favorite supermodel.

2375
01:40:58,541 --> 01:41:00,080
She's like 180 years old now.
She's.

2376

2381
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:15,180
Jesus christ.
What kind of genetics does she have?

2382
01:41:15,630 --> 01:41:17,970
Is that a recent image?
Looks reasonable.

2387
01:41:28,500 --> 01:41:29,820
Will you go back to her when she's 
young?

2388
01:41:29,821 --> 01:41:30,654
Jamie will pull up an image and when she

2391
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:38,433
No,
those aren't it.

2392
01:41:38,440 --> 01:41:41,470
That's her age.
You googled 90 look at that.

2393
01:41:43,130 --> 01:41:46,840
Oh yeah.

2395
01:41:48,431 --> 01:41:51,700

2396
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:52,930
Google,

2397
01:41:52,931 --> 01:41:55,210
Two thousand 18.
And see what she looks like now.

2398
01:41:55,250 --> 01:41:56,190
That was a.
That was a video.

2399
01:41:56,200 --> 01:41:57,430
I play it over.
That's real.

2400
01:41:57,580 --> 01:41:59,070
That was the scene where you just play?
Yeah.

2401
01:41:59,071 --> 01:42:00,700
That was New York stock exchange.
She's a gimme.

2402
01:42:00,701 --> 01:42:02,060
Go to images.
Let's see.

2403
01:42:03,290 --> 01:42:05,080
That second one is that we're here with 
the red.

2404
01:42:05,500 --> 01:42:08,470
The one above that with the cleveland.
That's insane.

2405
01:42:08,500 --> 01:42:11,560
She's fucking gorgeous.
Congratulations,

2406
01:42:11,561 --> 01:42:13,860
lady photographer.
she punched a photographer.

2407
01:42:13,870 --> 01:42:14,800
Click on that.
Fuck.

2408
01:42:14,801 --> 01:42:16,360
Yeah.
I love her even more.

2409
01:42:16,361 --> 01:42:18,370
She just got moxie because they're 
fucking annoying.

2410
01:42:18,530 --> 01:42:21,100
Punched a photographer at age 17 after 
he crossed the line.

2411
01:42:21,160 --> 01:42:23,370
Oh good.
She's knocked him the fuck out.

2412
01:42:23,440 --> 01:42:24,520
That,
by the way,

2413
01:42:24,550 --> 01:42:26,380
is the ultimate creepo move.

2414
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:29,530
Shit.
I knew a dude who was a photographer.

2415
01:42:29,740 --> 01:42:30,573
Yup.
I'm using air quotes because really it 

2416
01:42:32,201 --> 01:42:37,201
was a weed dealer and he also took hold 
in photography would do it for girls who

2417
01:42:38,021 --> 01:42:39,880
wanted to air quotes again.
Model.

2418
01:42:39,940 --> 01:42:40,301
Yeah.
Right.

2419
01:42:40,301 --> 01:42:42,070
And he would help them,
but he was just.

2420
01:42:42,100 --> 01:42:43,150
He would tell me,
yeah.

2421
01:42:43,151 --> 01:42:44,230
He goes,
you get them alone.

2422
01:42:44,410 --> 01:42:46,120
And the first time he take pictures with
him,

2423
01:42:46,121 --> 01:42:46,954
he barely talked to them.
You ignore them and then after awhile 

2424
01:42:49,720 --> 01:42:50,471
you say,
come on,

2425
01:42:50,471 --> 01:42:52,270
you gotta give me more.
You gotta show me more.

2426
01:42:52,390 --> 01:42:53,890
And the next thing you know,
you're banging them.

2427
01:42:53,950 --> 01:42:54,783
These are rapists by the way.
These are like sort of like a planned 

2428
01:42:57,521 --> 01:42:58,354
rape.
It was rape and anybody fucking sicko 

2429
01:43:01,840 --> 01:43:04,780
that figured out a way to get girls 
turned up like they wanted,

2430
01:43:04,840 --> 01:43:09,490
manipulate them on and they buy him,
ignoring them.

2431
01:43:09,880 --> 01:43:11,280
This was his move.
The date,

2432
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:14,320
the move was,
you take pictures of them the first time

2433
01:43:14,321 --> 01:43:17,140
and you totally ignore them and don't 
even pay attention.

2434
01:43:17,141 --> 01:43:18,790
I just take pictures of them like it's 
no big deal.

2435
01:43:18,791 --> 01:43:19,624
Okay.
Okay.

2436
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:22,000
Please try something else.
Okay.

2437
01:43:22,230 --> 01:43:25,090
Um,
stick your legs in different,

2438
01:43:25,120 --> 01:43:26,860
like put your foot back there.
That's it.

2439
01:43:26,890 --> 01:43:27,730
Okay,
look towards me.

2440
01:43:27,940 --> 01:43:28,690
Okay,
great.

2441
01:43:28,690 --> 01:43:29,523
Okay,
great.

2442
01:43:29,590 --> 01:43:31,210
And then there was no.
Wow,

2443
01:43:31,211 --> 01:43:32,740
you are so beautiful.
There was nothing.

2444
01:43:32,950 --> 01:43:34,090
there was nothing,
nothing.

2445
01:43:34,091 --> 01:43:34,924
You give them nothing.
and then then give them a little the 

2446
01:43:36,200 --> 01:43:37,033
second time and then he would start and 
he would take pictures with them for 

2447
01:43:38,981 --> 01:43:39,814
free because they all had no money but 
they wanted photos and you want to be 

2448
01:43:43,181 --> 01:43:45,550
models and he had good cameras,
sold weed.

2449
01:43:45,551 --> 01:43:46,384
So hE had a lot of money.
I don't know how difficult photography 

2450
01:43:50,111 --> 01:43:51,040
is.
You do have.

2451
01:43:51,140 --> 01:43:51,980
It's difficult for

2452
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:52,530
sure.
Yeah.

2453
01:43:52,530 --> 01:43:53,560
Well to be good at it.
It's.

2454
01:43:53,570 --> 01:43:54,950
Yeah.
What's the name of the creepo dude?

2455
01:43:54,951 --> 01:43:56,510
Terry,
what's his fucking name?

2456
01:43:56,600 --> 01:43:57,860
That guy that he got in trouble,
right.

2457
01:43:57,861 --> 01:43:58,800
He did like,
um.

2458
01:43:59,620 --> 01:44:01,000
Is that it?
yeah,

2459
01:44:01,190 --> 01:44:02,400
he,
he got in trouble for,

2460
01:44:02,430 --> 01:44:03,980
for being a creep and he was the kind of
guy.

2461
01:44:03,981 --> 01:44:06,500
All those photos he took of like,
you know,

2462
01:44:06,850 --> 01:44:10,760
well apparently it was a giant hog.
He have girls like jerk them off.

2463
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:12,050
Girls tug them molly.
Yeah.

2464
01:44:12,051 --> 01:44:13,940
This fucking guy.
And right.

2465
01:44:13,941 --> 01:44:15,380
Didn't you end up getting in trouble 
for.

2466
01:44:15,440 --> 01:44:15,881
Yeah.
Yeah.

2467
01:44:15,881 --> 01:44:19,550
He ended up getting an of trouble.
You have a look at this fucking guy.

2468
01:44:19,700 --> 01:44:21,140
Look at him.
He looked and when someone says,

2469
01:44:21,141 --> 01:44:22,040
what is a creep look,
look,

2470
01:44:22,041 --> 01:44:22,540
I go,
yeah,

2471
01:44:22,540 --> 01:44:23,373
like a fucking three quarter balding 
glasses weirdo with a strange mustache 

2472
01:44:26,901 --> 01:44:29,390
or mutton chops.
It's this guy for sure.

2473
01:44:32,480 --> 01:44:33,313
What's that?
We missed something with a net worth of 

2474
01:44:34,551 --> 01:44:36,770
$350.
million dollars.

2475
01:44:36,771 --> 01:44:38,780
Can he makes an additional 
$2,000,000,000

2476
01:44:38,781 --> 01:44:40,820
off of retail empire?
dude,

2477
01:44:40,850 --> 01:44:43,820
she's a gangster according to a profile 
on forbes magazine,

2478
01:44:43,821 --> 01:44:44,654
which means that Ireland has even 
surpassed rumored billionaire Jessica 

2479
01:44:47,570 --> 01:44:50,000
Simpson and revenue.
Damn jessica simpson's a billionaire.

2480
01:44:50,230 --> 01:44:51,310
So sam from,

2481
01:44:51,340 --> 01:44:52,220

2482
01:44:52,280 --> 01:44:54,220
from makeup and clothing and shit.
Yeah,

2483
01:44:54,230 --> 01:44:56,300
she's a genius.
Heard was often blowjobs.

2484
01:44:56,720 --> 01:45:00,050
Yeah.
You suck a billion to a billion bucks.

2485
01:45:00,080 --> 01:45:02,480
Imagine damn billionaire.
That's,

2486
01:45:02,520 --> 01:45:03,870

2487
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:05,720

01:45:05,721 --> 01:45:08,150
Slide into my dms.
Please come on.

2489
01:45:08,550 --> 01:45:09,383
Fucking billionaire mega.
I'll that photographer you punched and 

2490
01:45:14,540 --> 01:45:18,440
I'll finish the fucking job.
Job alive.

2491
01:45:19,150 --> 01:45:21,320
Crushes.
Break his ribs.

2492
01:45:21,680 --> 01:45:23,150
All of them.
It's fucking.

2493
01:45:23,240 --> 01:45:25,070
Imagine walking around with broken ribs.

2494
01:45:27,260 --> 01:45:28,670
I broke two ribs.
Planful,

2495
01:45:28,730 --> 01:45:30,890
playing football and I'll never forget 
the pain of that.

2496
01:45:30,891 --> 01:45:33,350
I'd rather I'd rather break any other 
bone than a rib.

2497
01:45:33,351 --> 01:45:34,340
Again,
you can't.

2498
01:45:34,550 --> 01:45:35,383
You can't inhale.
You like you can inhale and then when 

2499
01:45:37,071 --> 01:45:39,440
you sit down and you're like in pain.
I hated ribs.

2500
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:43,590
Broken arm,
a ankle collar,

2501
01:45:44,050 --> 01:45:46,200
bone,
ribs to collarbones.

2502
01:45:46,280 --> 01:45:47,320
Rough one.
Collarbone.

2503
01:45:47,330 --> 01:45:48,163
Fucking sucks.
My brother in law had a metal plate put 

2504
01:45:51,081 --> 01:45:51,914
in his shoulder because his collar bone 
was shattered in a motorcycle and I was 

2505
01:45:53,961 --> 01:45:56,600
just going to say it's either like 
motorcycles or skiing or like any,

2506
01:45:57,500 --> 01:46:00,110
any anything where you're going over 30 
miles an hour slam.

2507
01:46:00,120 --> 01:46:01,210
That's the only Way to break a 
collarbone.

2508
01:46:01,240 --> 01:46:03,200
There is no other way to fake 
collarbone.

2509
01:46:03,290 --> 01:46:04,340
Yeah,
because he.

2510
01:46:04,370 --> 01:46:07,370
Because he got hit by a car or 
motorcycle crash.

2511
01:46:07,630 --> 01:46:08,330
Why?
I'm saying,

2512
01:46:08,330 --> 01:46:09,410
oh,
he wiped ouT.

2513
01:46:09,410 --> 01:46:09,700
Wiped out.

2514
01:46:09,700 --> 01:46:12,470
I saw dude.
I saw a guy get hit the other day and it

2515
01:46:12,471 --> 01:46:14,510
made my.
Made my heart hurt for the cake.

2516
01:46:14,570 --> 01:46:15,920
Yeah,
he got smoked.

2517
01:46:16,460 --> 01:46:18,590
I watched it.
I watched it happen.

2518
01:46:19,370 --> 01:46:21,260
He was key.
Was going left through an intersection.

2519
01:46:21,280 --> 01:46:24,230
A guy ran the yellow.
He was really running a red,

2520
01:46:24,231 --> 01:46:25,220
it was red,
you know what I mean,

2521
01:46:25,720 --> 01:46:28,220
and,
and he slammed on the brakes and the car

2522
01:46:28,221 --> 01:46:29,054
turned a little bit and the bike and he 
tried to like jerk the bike as hard as 

2523
01:46:31,011 --> 01:46:32,460
he could,
button boom.

2524
01:46:33,320 --> 01:46:34,940
And it made my,
he was alive,

2525
01:46:34,970 --> 01:46:36,440
but I was just like,
oh,

2526
01:46:36,500 --> 01:46:37,820
probably broken.
Oh,

2527
01:46:37,821 --> 01:46:38,840
he was tall dude.
He couldn't,

2528
01:46:38,870 --> 01:46:40,220
he didn't move.
I mean,

2529
01:46:40,790 --> 01:46:43,410
fuck yeah.
Motorcycles are so scared.

2530
01:46:43,660 --> 01:46:48,410
The shit out of red light this morning 
and the light turned green and some dude

2531
01:46:48,500 --> 01:46:50,220
just whizzed

2532
01:46:50,220 --> 01:46:53,910
in between me and some guy who was about
to change lanes.

2533
01:46:54,030 --> 01:46:54,863
So like I'm in this lane and I'm driving
straight and this guy Was about to 

2534
01:46:57,121 --> 01:46:59,540
change lanes.
this guy went and I went,

2535
01:46:59,740 --> 01:47:01,410
oh,
inches away.

2536
01:47:01,500 --> 01:47:02,333
I almost saw death.
I saw a guy get killed and that happens 

2537
01:47:04,891 --> 01:47:07,950
all day every day in la because they're 
allowed to cut lanes.

2538
01:47:08,040 --> 01:47:09,930
But here's the thing.
Risk.

2539
01:47:10,110 --> 01:47:11,110
Yeah.
Yup.

2540
01:47:12,040 --> 01:47:12,873
In that thing where you're cutting lanes
and the guy turns into you and kills 

2541
01:47:16,201 --> 01:47:17,100
you,
it's their fault.

2542
01:47:17,101 --> 01:47:19,140
It's on you.
It's crazy.

2543
01:47:19,170 --> 01:47:22,230
Like in chicago,
you can't split lanes in Illinois you're

2544
01:47:22,231 --> 01:47:24,420
not allowed to shit and peel,
but there's no helmet law.

2545
01:47:24,630 --> 01:47:27,220
I seen that,
which to me is like the most chicago and

2546
01:47:27,221 --> 01:47:29,190
his shit.
So all these fucking guys on harleys.

2547
01:47:29,900 --> 01:47:34,900
Fucking helmets with their feet up on 
the things not wearing a helmet.

2548
01:47:35,080 --> 01:47:37,740
I'm not some,
not some faggy.

2549
01:47:37,741 --> 01:47:38,574
Dual did pushing scared of head trauma.
They should just all be forced to look 

2550
01:47:43,111 --> 01:47:47,340
at gary busey before and after.
You don't want to wear a fucking helmet.

2551
01:47:47,730 --> 01:47:48,563
Did him in.
I know you know he hit a curb with his 

2552
01:47:50,161 --> 01:47:53,910
skull.
He's alive is insane.

2553
01:47:53,940 --> 01:47:54,940
Oh,
the doctors.

2554
01:47:54,960 --> 01:47:56,090
Yeah.
Dr this shit.

2555
01:47:56,091 --> 01:47:58,050
I just smothered him with a pillow.
You're good.

2556
01:47:58,440 --> 01:47:59,273
We're gonna take you poor bastard.
I was watching something the other day 

2557
01:48:03,001 --> 01:48:03,834
with him.
Joe really recently talking and I was 

2558
01:48:06,061 --> 01:48:06,894
like,
whoa,

2559
01:48:07,640 --> 01:48:09,290
we're here on rogan.
Joe.

2560
01:48:09,300 --> 01:48:10,133
I fucking love you man.
He's fucking great bubble of having 

2561
01:48:13,410 --> 01:48:15,070
normal talk.
Yeah,

2562
01:48:15,140 --> 01:48:15,973
it's all like theatrical and animated 
because I think years of I think years 

2563
01:48:19,531 --> 01:48:23,370
of of acting and stuff late in his brain
and now that he's kinda like,

2564
01:48:23,371 --> 01:48:24,204
he's off the edge,
I think he feels like he has to be a 

2565
01:48:26,341 --> 01:48:28,170
caricature to like feel normal.

2566
01:48:28,230 --> 01:48:29,340
Right.
You know what I mean?

2567
01:48:29,341 --> 01:48:30,174
I think he's,
thAt's the way he masks the serious 

2568
01:48:33,361 --> 01:48:36,450
brain trauma and pain,
whatever pain is really going on.

2569
01:48:36,451 --> 01:48:37,770
I think that's it.
Maybe it's fine.

2570
01:48:37,920 --> 01:48:39,140
Maybe a medium and it's like,
hey,

2571
01:48:39,150 --> 01:48:40,560
I'm playing it up.
This is what I got.

2572
01:48:40,580 --> 01:48:41,011
He said,
what do you mean?

2573
01:48:41,011 --> 01:48:44,550
This is a bit my thing.
He's outside smoking a cigarette.

2574
01:48:44,551 --> 01:48:45,241
He goes,
what are you talking about?

2575
01:48:45,241 --> 01:48:46,074
Is a fucking bit.
It's just me doing fucking try and make 

2576
01:48:48,661 --> 01:48:49,500
a living.
Just making money,

2577
01:48:49,501 --> 01:48:50,760
man.
I'm trying to feel my fucking family.

2578
01:48:50,761 --> 01:48:51,930
Wait,
fuck is wrong with you.

2579
01:48:52,530 --> 01:48:53,363
So I got one.
I was like two inches higher than the 

2580
01:48:54,811 --> 01:48:55,644
other one.
That's what he's gotten out above his 

2581
01:48:57,661 --> 01:48:59,300
eyebrow.
It's like where I broke should be.

2582
01:48:59,320 --> 01:49:00,480
It's like way up here.
Well,

2583
01:49:00,540 --> 01:49:01,373
his goal,
god caved in and it was not funny to 

2584
01:49:04,171 --> 01:49:05,100
laugh at,
but my god,

2585
01:49:05,101 --> 01:49:06,990
it just,
he just looks when you see him,

2586
01:49:06,991 --> 01:49:08,160
when he's young,
you know,

2587
01:49:08,161 --> 01:49:09,920
he's kinda like a normal looking dude 
and like,

2588
01:49:09,940 --> 01:49:10,800
okay,
looking dude,

2589
01:49:10,890 --> 01:49:15,750
and then now you're like jesus christ 
and he's just all squirrely now.

2590
01:49:16,080 --> 01:49:18,000
But if you go back to him and like 
lethal weapon,

2591
01:49:18,001 --> 01:49:19,350
he was a bad motherfucker.
Look,

2592
01:49:19,370 --> 01:49:24,370
look at his left eyes down like shifted.
Something's Wrong.

2593
01:49:26,530 --> 01:49:28,230
Yeah.
But when he was young,

2594
01:49:28,350 --> 01:49:32,700
like the lethal weapon,
like when he played mr joshua to fucking

2595
01:49:32,701 --> 01:49:33,534
wicked and I was awesome.
I go to that one picture with the two 

2596
01:49:35,641 --> 01:49:36,750
heads.
Scroll,

2597
01:49:37,020 --> 01:49:38,730
scroll down please.
Photoshop.

2598
01:49:38,850 --> 01:49:40,410
Go to the one picture with the green 
lettering.

2599
01:49:42,420 --> 01:49:43,710
Photoshop.
Oh yeah.

2600
01:49:43,740 --> 01:49:48,080
Don't go to that after rude.
That's just being rude.

2601
01:49:48,130 --> 01:49:52,980
Being asked about the one the right hand
side with the suit suit on deloitte.

2602
01:49:53,500 --> 01:49:55,490
Below that with the suit.
The actual suit right there.

2603
01:49:55,570 --> 01:49:57,940
Yeah.
That's a real photo player.

2604
01:49:58,990 --> 01:50:01,860
Just being silly.
Well,

2605
01:50:01,900 --> 01:50:04,750
this was back when helmet laws didn't 
exist.

2606
01:50:04,960 --> 01:50:05,980
Yeah,
no helmet law.

2607
01:50:06,040 --> 01:50:08,500
You could ride around la with no helmet,
but they should.

2608
01:50:08,710 --> 01:50:10,180
I mean,
even if there wasn't a law,

2609
01:50:10,181 --> 01:50:12,130
why wouldn't you want to mean fuck me?
I,

2610
01:50:12,131 --> 01:50:12,964
I get that.
It's probably why I don't listen to all 

2611
01:50:14,111 --> 01:50:16,690
the community is like,
you don't get it bro.

2612
01:50:16,691 --> 01:50:19,430
You don't understand freedom.
I liked my fucking brain busey.

2613
01:50:19,520 --> 01:50:20,440
Yeah.
I liked my.

2614
01:50:20,530 --> 01:50:21,640
I liked my brain.
Sorry man.

2615
01:50:21,641 --> 01:50:23,710
I don't know.
But there's states.

2616
01:50:23,711 --> 01:50:25,870
Arizona is another one you see people 
with no.

2617
01:50:25,871 --> 01:50:26,700
Hell no.
Helmet law.

2618
01:50:26,700 --> 01:50:27,490
Yeah.
No helmet.

2619
01:50:27,490 --> 01:50:28,323
Texas.
I think vegas you allowed to have in 

2620
01:50:30,431 --> 01:50:32,800
Nevada.
I mean I've seen plenty of guys on bikes

2621
01:50:32,801 --> 01:50:33,850
without one,
but I can't tell you who.

2622
01:50:33,880 --> 01:50:35,560
What cop would pull you over.
You know what I mean?

2623
01:50:35,790 --> 01:50:37,690
Kind of like in vegas.
What do theY do?

2624
01:50:37,691 --> 01:50:40,320
The last thing on their fucking mind are
supposed to.

2625
01:50:40,530 --> 01:50:41,363
In vegas you are.
Look up just google states without 

2626
01:50:43,060 --> 01:50:45,040
helmet laws and see how many there are.
I Colorado,

2627
01:50:45,041 --> 01:50:47,950
I know you don't have to have one.
Definitely the wild country man,

2628
01:50:47,951 --> 01:50:49,270
that's.
They don't give a fuck.

2629
01:50:49,300 --> 01:50:50,930
Nope.
It's square state.

2630
01:50:50,980 --> 01:50:53,530
Squarespace.
Perfectly square medal in 19 states that

2631
01:50:53,531 --> 01:50:55,260
require it.
Wow.

2632
01:50:55,410 --> 01:50:56,660
In three.
One,

2633
01:50:56,890 --> 01:50:59,950
there is no motorcycle helmet.
Use law in three states,

2634
01:51:00,280 --> 01:51:00,971
Illinois,
Iowa,

2635
01:51:00,971 --> 01:51:04,030
and New Hampshire.
but says currently 19 states and the ndc

2636
01:51:04,360 --> 01:51:07,000
have laws requiring all writers,
all writers,

2637
01:51:07,180 --> 01:51:09,400
both past 19 states.
All riders.

2638
01:51:09,401 --> 01:51:10,234
Yeah,
but three states have no laws in 

2639
01:51:12,210 --> 01:51:13,240
Illinois,
but what?

2640
01:51:13,241 --> 01:51:15,940
But some states.
Wait a minute.

2641
01:51:16,660 --> 01:51:18,730
It's only three states where you can 
wear no helmet.

2642
01:51:19,860 --> 01:51:21,550
One of those states,
Illinois,

2643
01:51:21,610 --> 01:51:24,490
Iowa and New Hampshire bleed image or 
Colorado.

2644
01:51:26,790 --> 01:51:28,600
Maybe it's maybe it's maybe the law.
It's new.

2645
01:51:28,980 --> 01:51:30,880
Yeah.
Wait a minute.

2646
01:51:30,910 --> 01:51:34,660
Is it just google helmet laws in 
Colorado motorcycle.

2647
01:51:34,980 --> 01:51:38,410
I've seen people ride motorcycles in 
Colorado with no helmet.

2648
01:51:39,970 --> 01:51:42,170
Helmets are proven to save lives in 
Colorado.

2649
01:51:42,171 --> 01:51:43,004
However,
if the motorcycle operator passengers 

2650
01:51:44,561 --> 01:51:46,690
are under 18,
they must wear a helmet.

2651
01:51:46,730 --> 01:51:48,700
Passengers,
passenger law,

2652
01:51:49,420 --> 01:51:53,600
but that's not the under 18.
Uh,

2653
01:51:53,770 --> 01:51:56,080
if they're over 18,
they can Do whatever the fuck they want.

2654
01:51:56,230 --> 01:51:57,530
Is that what it says?
It says,

2655
01:51:57,820 --> 01:52:00,400
so there isn't a helmet law.
You just,

2656
01:52:00,430 --> 01:52:02,610
if you're,
if you're 18 or if you're 60 minutes,

2657
01:52:03,070 --> 01:52:03,903
they have helmet laws.
So what you're saying is three states 

2658
01:52:05,801 --> 01:52:09,000
have no helmet laws.
That means under 18,

2659
01:52:09,040 --> 01:52:10,820
over eight doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.

2660
01:52:10,821 --> 01:52:12,640
Right?
But some states have laws,

2661
01:52:12,641 --> 01:52:15,700
but grown ass adults can decide to go 
suicide.

2662
01:52:15,960 --> 01:52:18,280
They won't style and yeah,
that's what it is.

2663
01:52:19,100 --> 01:52:19,933
Yeah.
That's fucking crazy weird that people 

2664
01:52:20,861 --> 01:52:24,370
would fight for that.
They don't like saying no seatbelt law.

2665
01:52:24,590 --> 01:52:25,770
That's the crazy thing.
What do you don't.

2666
01:52:25,840 --> 01:52:27,160
You don't want to wear it.
But here's the thing,

2667
01:52:27,190 --> 01:52:29,620
like how is it okay to ride a 
motorcycle?

2668
01:52:29,680 --> 01:52:32,410
Ever?
And I have to have a seatbelt on.

2669
01:52:32,470 --> 01:52:34,600
Yeah.
Like I'm inside a metal cage.

2670
01:52:34,810 --> 01:52:37,800
That's it.
Motherfuckers that is a $3,500

2671
01:52:37,801 --> 01:52:38,634
pound cake.
It was steering wheel and this 

2672
01:52:40,811 --> 01:52:43,570
motherfuckers just got handlebars.
He can go flying.

2673
01:52:43,910 --> 01:52:44,743
I don't get that shit.
I don't know why you wouldn't want to 

2674
01:52:46,131 --> 01:52:47,510
fucking wear a helmet.
There's no.

2675
01:52:47,540 --> 01:52:49,400
There's nothing to hold you on.
You're fucked.

2676
01:52:49,430 --> 01:52:50,390
You get clipped.
You're done.

2677
01:52:50,600 --> 01:52:52,880
We're going to come into a time within 
the next 20 years,

2678
01:52:52,881 --> 01:52:55,370
we're automated.
Cars are going to be the norm and you're

2679
01:52:55,371 --> 01:52:56,204
not going to be allowed to drive.
There's going to be states where you're 

2680
01:52:57,771 --> 01:52:59,880
not allowed to drive yourself,
but,

2681
01:52:59,960 --> 01:53:01,490
but what you just said it was right.

2682
01:53:01,550 --> 01:53:02,383
There will be states that will 
absolutely fight against that to make 

2683
01:53:04,641 --> 01:53:08,330
sure people can still drive.
Fucking do whatever the fuck we want.

2684
01:53:08,360 --> 01:53:09,110
Yes.
Hello,

2685
01:53:09,110 --> 01:53:10,340
mr tesla.
Man.

2686
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:12,170
Listen here.
Ilan mirsky.

2687
01:53:12,350 --> 01:53:13,183
I saw you smoked pot on rhogam.
You don't know what the fuck you're 

2688
01:53:16,491 --> 01:53:19,460
talking about.
Rotten out from the inside.

2689
01:53:19,490 --> 01:53:20,323
Shooting dildos into space on it.
What the fuck to ilan fucking shady 

2690
01:53:23,750 --> 01:53:24,583
motherfucker.
One of my favorite conspiracy theories 

2691
01:53:26,091 --> 01:53:26,924
with the.
Whether there's an actual man that like 

2692
01:53:28,730 --> 01:53:33,730
fucked elan's wife that was in the suit 
of the space.

2693
01:53:35,170 --> 01:53:38,040
Imagine space.
Yeah.

2694
01:53:38,180 --> 01:53:39,020
Hey,
duct tapes.

2695
01:53:39,021 --> 01:53:40,730
Your mouth is,
traps you into a rocket,

2696
01:53:41,180 --> 01:53:45,090
launches you into space.
He gives you oxygen for like five days.

2697
01:53:45,091 --> 01:53:48,260
That would be the most.
I'm going to let you see space,

2698
01:53:48,261 --> 01:53:50,330
but then you're gonna fucking die.
You're gonna.

2699
01:53:50,331 --> 01:53:54,920
Die slow burning nuts and poisoned t and
a little tube debris,

2700
01:53:55,400 --> 01:53:57,980
but when you shit yourself,
you will die in this space.

2701
01:53:58,660 --> 01:54:01,460
There's a guy in that suit that's a 
great conspiracy.

2702
01:54:01,520 --> 01:54:06,520
Imagine what a fucking psychopath you 
have to be to launch a car that you made

2703
01:54:06,590 --> 01:54:09,350
in this space like that.
Can I tell you something?

2704
01:54:09,351 --> 01:54:11,600
That's dope car.
I think that's the coolest fucking thing

2705
01:54:11,601 --> 01:54:14,810
anybody's ever done in space is some 
shit into space.

2706
01:54:15,140 --> 01:54:15,973
That's an artifact.
It's an artifact for someone to find 

2707
01:54:17,620 --> 01:54:18,453
you.
Imagine if you're an alien race and 

2708
01:54:19,461 --> 01:54:21,190
you're flying by like we're going to go 
to earth.

2709
01:54:21,590 --> 01:54:22,920
We spotted something.
What?

2710
01:54:22,930 --> 01:54:25,040
It seems to be some sort of vehicle.
Someone's coming towards us,

2711
01:54:25,500 --> 01:54:30,500
signaling him shit and nuts and poison 
in it.

2712
01:54:34,251 --> 01:54:35,084
Dope car.
That's a fucking awesome looking car 

2713
01:54:37,101 --> 01:54:39,380
too.
Imagine send that thing in this space.

2714
01:54:39,410 --> 01:54:41,270
you saw the tesla.
You saw the tesla roadster,

2715
01:54:41,271 --> 01:54:43,040
huh?
When that thing comes out?

2716
01:54:43,710 --> 01:54:44,171
No,
he didn't.

2717
01:54:44,171 --> 01:54:45,230
No,
he didn't bring it here.

2718
01:54:45,231 --> 01:54:45,830
No,
no he didn't.

2719
01:54:45,830 --> 01:54:46,581
No he didn't.
No,

2720
01:54:46,581 --> 01:54:49,040
it doesn't come out until 2020,
but I thought he has.

2721
01:54:49,630 --> 01:54:50,440
Yeah,
he didn't bring it.

2722
01:54:50,440 --> 01:54:52,690
That was it.
That was his thought.

2723
01:54:53,030 --> 01:54:53,990
He had another one.
I thought he.

2724
01:54:54,200 --> 01:54:56,420
I thought he still got sure ms dot but 
wait,

2725
01:54:56,421 --> 01:54:59,480
but right now it's the fastest 
production vehicle ever made,

2726
01:54:59,481 --> 01:55:00,140
right?
Yeah.

2727
01:55:00,140 --> 01:55:00,973
Zero to 60 in one.
One point six and one point one point 

2728
01:55:03,850 --> 01:55:04,683
six,
six.

2729
01:55:05,390 --> 01:55:07,550
Something insane like that.
The word should be absurd.

2730
01:55:07,940 --> 01:55:11,030
That's an absurd.
To go that fast.

2731
01:55:11,060 --> 01:55:12,540
if you ever driven a tesla,
dude,

2732
01:55:12,560 --> 01:55:14,420
I've been in a pd.
The pd 100.

2733
01:55:14,421 --> 01:55:16,640
The ludicrous mode.
yeah.

2734
01:55:16,940 --> 01:55:18,380
It's insane.
Too fast.

2735
01:55:18,770 --> 01:55:19,700
It's weird.
I would.

2736
01:55:19,760 --> 01:55:22,140
I would die in that car,
but it's weird how fast it.

2737
01:55:22,150 --> 01:55:22,780
It's,
it's,

2738
01:55:22,780 --> 01:55:23,990
it's sillY.
My cars.

2739
01:55:23,991 --> 01:55:26,240
Five hundred 10 horses.
That's fast.

2740
01:55:26,430 --> 01:55:28,040
When your car is,
get that rumble.

2741
01:55:28,100 --> 01:55:29,390
Oh,
well I love engines,

2742
01:55:29,391 --> 01:55:30,950
man.
I don't think I'll ever give up engines.

2743
01:55:32,630 --> 01:55:34,300
You know.
My buddy said,

2744
01:55:34,310 --> 01:55:35,750
he goes,
it sounds like a fucking boat.

2745
01:55:35,751 --> 01:55:37,100
I go,
it does sound like a boat.

2746
01:55:37,101 --> 01:55:37,934
When I was a kid,
I remember sitting outside on the lake 

2747
01:55:39,051 --> 01:55:39,884
of hearing people's boats.
I like engines have alwaYs been an 

2748
01:55:43,291 --> 01:55:44,124
engine guy.

2749
01:55:44,610 --> 01:55:47,130
I'm a guy.
Drink.

2750
01:55:47,190 --> 01:55:49,590
I can't have one poor little more and 
have one for you.

2751
01:55:49,591 --> 01:55:51,480
I'll have one for jellies.
Have one for me.

2752
01:55:51,570 --> 01:55:55,620
I got to do two hours of courses for 
christ and have a heart attack,

2753
01:55:57,210 --> 01:55:58,710
I should say.
I love birds so much.

2754
01:55:58,850 --> 01:55:59,683
I love everybody in the competition.
I just don't like the fact that bird is 

2755
01:56:02,041 --> 01:56:02,874
on these medications that could.
All of these health problems could be 

2756
01:56:06,121 --> 01:56:09,510
completely resolved if you just didn't 
drink so much.

2757
01:56:09,900 --> 01:56:12,120
Like to take medication so that you can 
drink.

2758
01:56:12,330 --> 01:56:13,250
It's not Good,
you know?

2759
01:56:13,270 --> 01:56:14,103
I mean,
I haD this conversation a long time ago 

2760
01:56:15,331 --> 01:56:18,990
with anthony bourdain.
He was on statens and he decided to take

2761
01:56:18,991 --> 01:56:23,490
statens because he liked to eat and I 
don't know what it's good for.

2762
01:56:23,520 --> 01:56:24,570
People that have,
um,

2763
01:56:25,310 --> 01:56:26,143
it's,
it was that high blood pressure or high 

2764
01:56:27,301 --> 01:56:29,250
cholesterol,
what is stands for.

2765
01:56:30,240 --> 01:56:31,073
He had obviously he was drinking 
constantly and he was traveling 

2766
01:56:35,880 --> 01:56:36,713
constantly and he wasn't exercising 
cholesterol and he had had some health 

2767
01:56:41,671 --> 01:56:42,504
issues and so they put them on these 
statens and he started doing brazilian 

2768
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,010
jujitsu and we started doing brazilian 
jujitsu.

2769
01:56:49,080 --> 01:56:51,180
He lost a shitload of weight,
changed his diet,

2770
01:56:51,181 --> 01:56:55,560
radically cut back on drinking and got 
off the statens.

2771
01:56:56,420 --> 01:57:00,330
But statens have siGnificant health 
risks attached to them.

2772
01:57:00,580 --> 01:57:03,480
It's not as simple as they just lower 
your cholesterol.

2773
01:57:03,481 --> 01:57:06,570
They also do a lot of wonky shit to your
whole system,

2774
01:57:06,690 --> 01:57:08,230
to your mental.
Uh,

2775
01:57:08,240 --> 01:57:10,830
I don't.
I don't know about mental gracie.

2776
01:57:10,860 --> 01:57:11,671
Right?
Well,

2777
01:57:11,671 --> 01:57:14,190
he trained with henzel gracie in New 
York city.

2778
01:57:14,600 --> 01:57:16,620
The hands henzel great piece on it 
somewhere.

2779
01:57:16,650 --> 01:57:19,230
One of the best gyms in the world.
I know I'm jumping backwards,

2780
01:57:19,470 --> 01:57:20,303
but you mentioned something that now 
clicked into my head with the mediator 

2781
01:57:21,991 --> 01:57:24,150
show that your friend does steve when 
he.

2782
01:57:24,210 --> 01:57:25,043
I think there was a show.
I think there was a clip I just saw 

2783
01:57:26,111 --> 01:57:29,520
online of him using rendering bear fat 
to cook bear.

2784
01:57:29,850 --> 01:57:30,683
I just had watched that.
I thought that was fucking amazing 

2785
01:57:32,311 --> 01:57:34,140
because he was like,
I mean,

2786
01:57:34,141 --> 01:57:35,580
I've never,
I'd never heard of that before.

2787
01:57:35,581 --> 01:57:39,600
That you can,
you can boil down the bear fat to use as

2788
01:57:39,630 --> 01:57:40,463
oil to cook the rest of the meat because
he's saying it was so rich that it was 

2789
01:57:44,551 --> 01:57:49,290
almost like you could fry neat in it.
He did fry me to fucking blind people.

2790
01:57:49,291 --> 01:57:54,291
Have you been using bear fat for ages?
For lard to cook pies?

2791
01:57:54,781 --> 01:57:55,614
And he was actually talking about on a 
podcast recently that he has a great 

2792
01:57:58,471 --> 01:58:00,570
podcast as well called mediator,
same name.

2793
01:58:00,870 --> 01:58:01,703
And uh,
on the podcast they were discussing how 

2794
01:58:03,870 --> 01:58:04,703
a fat was used.
That's him there at the rendering this 

2795
01:58:09,391 --> 01:58:10,224
bear fat.
This is a particularly interesting 

2796
01:58:11,251 --> 01:58:14,880
episode because this was all about bears
who eat blueberries.

2797
01:58:14,940 --> 01:58:19,940
So all that fat had a purple tone to it,
a purple hue to it because the bears had

2798
01:58:20,671 --> 01:58:24,060
been,
they had been subsisting on blueberries.

2799
01:58:24,420 --> 01:58:29,420
So they tasted like blueberries.
Blueberry fat was supposed to be fucking

2800
01:58:30,601 --> 01:58:33,480
incredible and you render it down and 
make lard out of it.

2801
01:58:33,660 --> 01:58:37,500
And that lord is good literally for 
years and use it for cooking and for all

2802
01:58:37,501 --> 01:58:39,890
kinds of things afterwards.
But bear lard,

2803
01:58:39,891 --> 01:58:42,280
like I have my good friends,

2804
01:58:42,280 --> 01:58:44,330
john and jen rivet who,
uh,

2805
01:58:44,650 --> 01:58:49,650
live in alberta and they run a bear 
hunting operation up there and they bear

2806
01:58:49,871 --> 01:58:54,871
all the time and they render bear fat 
into these jars of bear lard.

2807
01:58:54,900 --> 01:58:57,700
I want to have you cook.
It's fucking delicious in Canada.

2808
01:58:57,701 --> 01:58:59,380
Next week,
tell them to come see me in where,

2809
01:58:59,381 --> 01:59:00,940
where are you in calgary?
oh,

2810
01:59:00,970 --> 01:59:01,803
that's close to them.
I'll tell them to come see you because 

2811
01:59:03,370 --> 01:59:04,870
they're.
They're lovely people.

2812
01:59:05,050 --> 01:59:08,950
I fucking burn as great country up 
there,

2813
01:59:08,951 --> 01:59:09,980
man.
People and code.

2814
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:10,833
A full man and some of the night is one 
of the most beautiful places I've ever 

2815
01:59:13,031 --> 01:59:16,180
visited in my life.
I haven't been to the national forest up

2816
01:59:16,181 --> 01:59:19,290
there.
She'll go do a picture of lake louise to

2817
01:59:19,300 --> 01:59:22,600
be a m.
F is bad ass mother fucker be a n.

2818
01:59:22,690 --> 01:59:23,770
F,
f.

2819
01:59:23,770 --> 01:59:25,600
Banff was not the same thing.
Now it's not the same,

2820
01:59:25,630 --> 01:59:26,740
but it is bad as fuck.

2821
01:59:27,530 --> 01:59:28,690
It's dope.
It's.

2822
01:59:28,730 --> 01:59:30,490
It's different in that we don't use 
negatives.

2823
01:59:30,491 --> 01:59:31,810
Divine.
Don't use negative.

2824
01:59:32,180 --> 01:59:33,400
It's divine.
Divine.

2825
01:59:34,590 --> 01:59:37,150
Look at that fucking place that's in 
banff.

2826
01:59:37,151 --> 01:59:39,040
National forest.
God damn.

2827
01:59:39,430 --> 01:59:41,080
Look at that.
Oh,

2828
01:59:41,081 --> 01:59:41,914
Canada is that.
There's really a hotel right there on 

2829
01:59:44,081 --> 01:59:46,450
the water.
That's looks like a fucking disgrace.

2830
01:59:47,350 --> 01:59:50,650
Doesn't that look like an eyesore?
God damn hotel,

2831
01:59:50,740 --> 01:59:52,420
wouldn't they though?
People are gross,

2832
01:59:52,990 --> 01:59:53,823
but how beautiful.
Look at how fucking gorgeous lake 

2833
01:59:55,410 --> 01:59:56,710
louise's looks.
Fake.

2834
01:59:57,610 --> 01:59:59,470
That's what I said the first time I went
there I go phony.

2835
01:59:59,620 --> 02:00:03,400
This looks like a guy made it on a 
studio like a girl has like photoshop.

2836
02:00:03,730 --> 02:00:04,563
When you ever see girls,
when they put that filter on their face 

2837
02:00:06,971 --> 02:00:08,410
where they don't even look like a real 
thing.

2838
02:00:08,411 --> 02:00:11,460
Like we need to filter why?
Whoever invented that tricking.

2839
02:00:11,500 --> 02:00:12,011
You know,
it's so fun.

2840
02:00:12,011 --> 02:00:14,290
What's even grosser guys who use that?

2841
02:00:14,320 --> 02:00:15,153
Well,
come on.

2842
02:00:15,880 --> 02:00:16,713
Nobody.
I know.

2843
02:00:17,260 --> 02:00:22,260
I know a guy.
Selfies with face filter and you look at

2844
02:00:22,361 --> 02:00:22,661
it,
you're like,

2845
02:00:22,661 --> 02:00:26,230
what in the fuck am I seeing here?
Is everything okay?

2846
02:00:26,231 --> 02:00:28,120
Are you doing with your face match your 
grandfather.

2847
02:00:28,121 --> 02:00:28,954
So fuck happened to your faith.
Fought in Korea so you could fuck with 

2848
02:00:31,601 --> 02:00:34,270
you face to a gun.
Damn cartoon.

2849
02:00:35,290 --> 02:00:38,980
You're animated and yourself.
but that looks like it's photoshop.

2850
02:00:39,010 --> 02:00:40,640
So press In.
that was.

2851
02:00:40,990 --> 02:00:42,820
That was the first time in alberta that 
I saw a moose.

2852
02:00:42,860 --> 02:00:45,230
I'd never seen a moose live before.
Crazy.

2853
02:00:45,270 --> 02:00:46,270
Didn't.
I went there and I was like,

2854
02:00:46,271 --> 02:00:48,600
holy shit,
what is the size?

2855
02:00:49,020 --> 02:00:51,370
It's a size of one of those dump trucks 
they in,

2856
02:00:51,410 --> 02:00:52,243
in dig sites,
you know there's like the where the 

2857
02:00:53,261 --> 02:00:54,790
wheels are five feet high.
It was like,

2858
02:00:55,890 --> 02:00:57,610
get out of here.
I was going to fuck me up.

2859
02:00:57,610 --> 02:00:59,410
That thing runs afternoon start 
stomping.

2860
02:01:00,110 --> 02:01:00,943
Yeah,
and they're late in their strides are 

2861
02:01:01,841 --> 02:01:04,510
like 10 feet long.
I just had no idea.

2862
02:01:04,511 --> 02:01:07,110
I guess as a kid we didn't.
I never saw the,

2863
02:01:07,200 --> 02:01:11,790
the only animals like that I saw were 
either deer or a.

2864
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:12,753
The only four legged thing I would see 
in the wild was so dear as a kid in the 

2865
02:01:14,771 --> 02:01:17,380
woods about this.
Look at the elc that's on the wall.

2866
02:01:17,381 --> 02:01:19,030
Right.
That's an enormous animal.

2867
02:01:19,050 --> 02:01:19,360
Yeah.
Like,

2868
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:20,950
look at the size of the antlers.
Yeah.

2869
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:21,611
It's huge.
Uh,

2870
02:01:21,611 --> 02:01:24,290
moves is twice that door.
It's got doors by a moose,

2871
02:01:24,540 --> 02:01:25,450
weiss that.
But yeah,

2872
02:01:26,060 --> 02:01:29,540
that was thing for 2000 pound first time
I saw buffalo.

2873
02:01:29,580 --> 02:01:31,150
Same way in Colorado.
I'd never seen before.

2874
02:01:31,180 --> 02:01:32,013
I mean in chicago,
like only when you go to the forest 

2875
02:01:33,521 --> 02:01:34,354
preserve,
so the lakes do you get to see deer and 

2876
02:01:35,320 --> 02:01:36,760
other than that you're like,
that's it.

2877
02:01:36,940 --> 02:01:37,773
I mean There's nothing else in Illinois.
How many people do you think every year 

2878
02:01:40,791 --> 02:01:43,430
get fucked up by a buffalo in 
yellowstone?

2879
02:01:44,300 --> 02:01:49,300
Probably at least a couple of idiots.
What boston dynamics just released a new

2880
02:01:51,261 --> 02:01:55,710
video and it's scary.
What these fucking freaks.

2881
02:01:57,140 --> 02:01:59,150
They want to kill.
Oh my god.

2882
02:01:59,230 --> 02:02:02,690
It's jumping over logs.
It's got no wires now.

2883
02:02:02,780 --> 02:02:04,180
Now they've.
Oh my god.

2884
02:02:04,190 --> 02:02:06,000
Do park whore.
It's doing park core,

2885
02:02:06,080 --> 02:02:08,440
hardcore par core boston dynamics.
Look at it.

2886
02:02:08,441 --> 02:02:13,130
Jump from box to box.
You guys cut it the fuck.

2887
02:02:13,160 --> 02:02:13,993
I don't know.
A lot of people who couldn't do with 

2888
02:02:14,960 --> 02:02:18,350
that robot.
Just do like most people you know.

2889
02:02:18,351 --> 02:02:19,184
Can't do what that robot just did.
I would say that's the majority of the 

2890
02:02:21,441 --> 02:02:22,550
country.
Could never do that.

2891
02:02:22,640 --> 02:02:24,500
That's insane.
Play that one more time.

2892
02:02:24,501 --> 02:02:25,334
Yeah.
What is the name of the videos for 

2893
02:02:27,021 --> 02:02:30,770
people that are just listening to those 
core hardcore atlas?

2894
02:02:30,771 --> 02:02:33,320
Is that the name of the robot atlas?
That's the one that's gonna kill us all,

2895
02:02:33,880 --> 02:02:34,713
but he's got a battery pack on.
Look at him just bouncing around like 

2896
02:02:37,341 --> 02:02:38,420
it's nothing.
You knoW?

2897
02:02:38,421 --> 02:02:39,254
They had some.
They released some voice recognition 

2898
02:02:40,911 --> 02:02:43,240
from him and he was like,
I want to.

2899
02:02:43,710 --> 02:02:48,710
I want to murder everyone.
Most when I stop people coming on eggs,

2900
02:02:49,490 --> 02:02:51,560
I'm a big fan of joe rogan.
Joe,

2901
02:02:51,590 --> 02:02:53,750
I think you would the best.
I won't rip your cock off.

2902
02:02:53,850 --> 02:02:54,490
Ha ha,
ha,

2903
02:02:54,490 --> 02:02:55,323
ha ha.

2904
02:02:58,840 --> 02:03:00,840
You imagined that fucking machine face 
to face to you.

2905
02:03:00,841 --> 02:03:04,190
Like I actually enjoy you as a person.
I won't kill you.

2906
02:03:04,310 --> 02:03:06,740
It's going to happen.
They're going to keep doing it.

2907
02:03:06,920 --> 02:03:09,380
We're fucked.
When I was doing my cardio yesterday,

2908
02:03:09,381 --> 02:03:11,510
I was watching x mokena.
Hm.

2909
02:03:12,150 --> 02:03:14,630
That's a great fucking movie.
One of my all time favorites.

2910
02:03:14,930 --> 02:03:16,850
I literally watched that movie at least 
five times.

2911
02:03:16,851 --> 02:03:18,470
Scares me,
but I also am in love with it.

2912
02:03:18,500 --> 02:03:20,450
I love it,
but when I'm watching that movie,

2913
02:03:20,451 --> 02:03:21,950
I'm like,
how far away is this?

2914
02:03:22,450 --> 02:03:24,910
A couple years i.
It's got to be less.

2915
02:03:24,950 --> 02:03:25,783
I think 10 years.
I think maybe a decade is when we'll 

2916
02:03:27,441 --> 02:03:29,630
have that,
but when they look like that that good.

2917
02:03:30,110 --> 02:03:32,390
Have you seen some of the fucking molds 
that they've already had now?

2918
02:03:33,110 --> 02:03:34,370
Have you ever seen some of these,
these,

2919
02:03:34,371 --> 02:03:36,710
these.
Like the molds that they can make now to

2920
02:03:36,711 --> 02:03:39,290
make look real already is scary to me.

2921
02:03:39,320 --> 02:03:40,153
There's a bunch of people protesting in 
houston because they were about to open 

2922
02:03:41,931 --> 02:03:45,260
up the first robot sex brothel.
Wow.

2923
02:03:45,261 --> 02:03:46,094
That's really interesting.
I don't think that's going to do much 

2924
02:03:47,841 --> 02:03:49,130
business.
Who wants a nut?

2925
02:03:49,170 --> 02:03:51,170
Some robot that somebody else already.
Nut and then two.

2926
02:03:51,171 --> 02:03:52,220
I dunno dude.
A lot.

2927
02:03:52,250 --> 02:03:54,350
I don't know about in the United States,
but I think in overseas,

2928
02:03:54,351 --> 02:03:55,184
I think fucking like japanese.
Love that they love coming and we will 

2929
02:03:58,340 --> 02:03:59,173
Both go to fucking robots.
How much do you get paid to put the 

2930
02:04:03,110 --> 02:04:05,920
cleaner?
The robot Cleaner?

2931
02:04:06,800 --> 02:04:11,800
Just like dead fish loads.
Washout.

2932
02:04:14,180 --> 02:04:15,480
Portal for you?
Load.

2933
02:04:15,500 --> 02:04:16,333
Smell like dead fish.
When they sit in your underwear and 

2934
02:04:17,631 --> 02:04:19,780
steam up just hangs out for a while.
Yeah.

2935
02:04:21,430 --> 02:04:23,920
if you jerk off and you don't clean up,
you just let it go.

2936
02:04:23,960 --> 02:04:26,750
Whoa.
What is this sex brothel in houston?

2937
02:04:26,751 --> 02:04:28,060
That's the ones that actually opened.

2938
02:04:28,140 --> 02:04:29,320
Now there's still discussion,
but this,

2939
02:04:29,360 --> 02:04:30,193
this here says that by 20,
20 it will be in houston and nine other 

2940
02:04:33,381 --> 02:04:34,550
cities.
Now,

2941
02:04:34,640 --> 02:04:38,580
dId that guy make that sex or is he 
going to fuck it?

2942
02:04:38,910 --> 02:04:41,220
He made it any fucking.
what do you think?

2943
02:04:41,221 --> 02:04:44,100
If you had to guess,
I think for sure that's his wife.

2944
02:04:44,190 --> 02:04:45,023
Here's the thing about the sex robots.
Do you think that anybody is going to 

2945
02:04:47,551 --> 02:04:50,100
make a sex robot that looks like your 
average gal?

2946
02:04:50,760 --> 02:04:52,330
No.
Yo.

2947
02:04:52,360 --> 02:04:52,770
Yeah.
Yeah.

2948
02:04:52,770 --> 02:04:53,281
Well,
next year.

2949
02:04:53,281 --> 02:04:54,490
Like the next door type of girl.
Yeah,

2950
02:04:54,491 --> 02:04:54,800
yeah,
yeah.

2951
02:04:54,800 --> 02:04:55,520
No.
Well,

2952
02:04:55,520 --> 02:04:56,353
well,
how many of them are going to look like 

2953
02:04:57,241 --> 02:04:59,310
this girl right here,
the exaggerated features.

2954
02:04:59,311 --> 02:05:00,780
Ninety percent of them will look like 
that.

2955
02:05:01,230 --> 02:05:04,110
At least will a girls looked like that 
now anyway,

2956
02:05:04,111 --> 02:05:06,150
you see girls on the internet,
they all look phony ass shit.

2957
02:05:06,300 --> 02:05:09,110
Everyone wants to have the same lips 
button thing.

2958
02:05:09,150 --> 02:05:11,280
Every girl on the internet now it looks 
phony ass shit.

2959
02:05:11,700 --> 02:05:13,860
No one looks like a chicken anymore.
But what is,

2960
02:05:13,861 --> 02:05:14,694
um,
what is the future going to be for like 

2961
02:05:16,411 --> 02:05:17,244
when,
when it's not a human and you can do 

2962
02:05:19,021 --> 02:05:19,854
whatever you want with it,
that's when you're going to find out 

2963
02:05:21,331 --> 02:05:23,760
what people really are attracted to.
It's exactly right.

2964
02:05:23,761 --> 02:05:25,770
You're going to find out the real sexual
psychology of humans.

2965
02:05:25,771 --> 02:05:28,050
When we find out that there is no rules 
with these things.

2966
02:05:28,080 --> 02:05:28,913
Save all your male feminisT nonsense.
I just live real women with 

2967
02:05:31,561 --> 02:05:32,730
birkenstocks.
Yeah,

2968
02:05:32,780 --> 02:05:33,613
yeah.
Oh yeah.

2969
02:05:33,640 --> 02:05:35,310
What do you fucking.
When you go to the brothel,

2970
02:05:36,060 --> 02:05:39,060
what are you ordering up on your amazon 
sex robot?

2971
02:05:39,630 --> 02:05:41,060
Chia seeds.
Look at that.

2972
02:05:41,090 --> 02:05:42,810
How weird.
What is happening here?

2973
02:05:43,260 --> 02:05:45,300
So here's my biggest curiosity.
wait a minute,

2974
02:05:45,301 --> 02:05:46,800
mr.
You can fuck a dude.

2975
02:05:47,400 --> 02:05:48,233
Fuck one of them.

2976
02:05:48,540 --> 02:05:51,520
I was going to get,
get a uh,

2977
02:05:51,660 --> 02:05:52,930
you know,
they have those um,

2978
02:05:53,810 --> 02:05:55,410
uh,
what are those real dolls?

2979
02:05:55,530 --> 02:05:56,880
they have mail,
real dolls.

2980
02:05:57,060 --> 02:06:00,420
I was going to get a mail.
Real doll with no debt and no butthole,

2981
02:06:00,690 --> 02:06:02,740
no mouth hole either.
Just for jujitsu.

2982
02:06:02,741 --> 02:06:03,574
And I was like,
listen,

2983
02:06:03,890 --> 02:06:04,723
you send me one,
I don't want anything I can fuck and 

2984
02:06:07,800 --> 02:06:08,790
fuck up.
And they're like,

2985
02:06:08,791 --> 02:06:10,070
sure sir.
We've heard this before.

2986
02:06:10,071 --> 02:06:13,420
I'm going to put three bottles.
We're going to have,

2987
02:06:13,430 --> 02:06:16,380
we're going to put a bundle on its side 
going to butthole and its forehead.

2988
02:06:20,280 --> 02:06:21,113
I just don't see a business.
I see a business for them creating 

2989
02:06:24,990 --> 02:06:27,580
personal sex robots for sure.
Have a niche,

2990
02:06:27,610 --> 02:06:30,090
niche market.
I got to tell you,

2991
02:06:30,390 --> 02:06:33,600
I know this has always been a big hype 
for the past couple of years of like sex

2992
02:06:33,601 --> 02:06:35,250
robot,
sex robots and people are like,

2993
02:06:35,300 --> 02:06:36,210
what?
It's going to be the end.

2994
02:06:36,211 --> 02:06:38,220
IT's like now people are always gonna 
want to fuck people.

2995
02:06:38,280 --> 02:06:40,680
You want to have reciprocation of 
something.

2996
02:06:40,681 --> 02:06:42,060
There's gotta be some kind of 
reciprocation,

2997
02:06:42,330 --> 02:06:44,730
you know?
Do you want to fuck a dead thing?

2998
02:06:44,980 --> 02:06:47,430
But also it's like,
it's like real feely almost.

2999
02:06:47,431 --> 02:06:48,480
Yeah.
Well,

3000
02:06:48,481 --> 02:06:49,860
yeah.
Well it's also,

3001
02:06:50,220 --> 02:06:51,870
you know,
there's no emotions there.

3002
02:06:52,020 --> 02:06:54,390
IT's going to be like playing a video 
game on god mode,

3003
02:06:54,810 --> 02:06:55,380
right?
You,

3004
02:06:55,380 --> 02:06:56,640
yeah.
You're flawless.

3005
02:06:56,670 --> 02:07:00,420
toronto's first sex doll broth has been 
open for a year.

3006
02:07:00,450 --> 02:07:03,090
How are they doing the same company 
that's already been open there,

3007
02:07:03,120 --> 02:07:03,930
but how are they doing?
Fine.

3008
02:07:03,930 --> 02:07:04,860
Is iT,
is it working?

3009
02:07:05,740 --> 02:07:06,573
That's my curiosity.
What's the success rate of a place like 

3010
02:07:08,160 --> 02:07:08,993
this?

3011
02:07:12,570 --> 02:07:16,530
Why does this gross me out?
Kinky slots called halls,

3012
02:07:16,630 --> 02:07:20,010
so I couldn't read kinky as adults only.
Yeah,

3013
02:07:20,011 --> 02:07:20,850
yeah,
yeah.

3014
02:07:20,851 --> 02:07:23,100
Let me get in there.
I love that you have to click.

3015
02:07:23,101 --> 02:07:25,430
Are you an adult yet?
I'm going to adult sure.

3016
02:07:27,330 --> 02:07:29,550
Rent,
before you buy rent,

3017
02:07:29,580 --> 02:07:34,580
before you buy fake.
I have a loan out system of vaginas.

3018
02:07:35,260 --> 02:07:39,610
Look how they all look like.
Don't any of them look like a secretary?

3019
02:07:40,120 --> 02:07:42,370
No.
All of them look like some super.

3020
02:07:42,371 --> 02:07:42,960
Whoa.
Yeah,

3021
02:07:42,960 --> 02:07:43,793
yeah,
yeah.

3022
02:07:43,870 --> 02:07:45,490
Right.
like isn't there one?

3023
02:07:45,491 --> 02:07:47,760
don't have like a starbucks barista 
option on.

3024
02:07:47,770 --> 02:07:51,340
She's kind of attractive and she's cute.
She's 3,200.

3025
02:07:51,430 --> 02:07:53,560
Look at it.
Tid ties by body.

3026
02:07:53,561 --> 02:07:54,980
Heat or voice.
Wait a minute.

3027
02:07:55,170 --> 02:07:57,730
Is that what it costs to buy?
Thirty $200.

3028
02:07:57,731 --> 02:07:58,960
Only 3,200
bucks.

3029
02:07:58,990 --> 02:07:59,890
Jamie.
Get one in here.

3030
02:07:59,891 --> 02:08:04,390
But let me see what photos look like so 
we can order one.

3031
02:08:05,380 --> 02:08:06,213
Order one.
How many people would be furious at us 

3032
02:08:08,171 --> 02:08:10,360
if we had one sitting behind me during 
the show?

3033
02:08:10,420 --> 02:08:12,940
you would just cut another camera.
Would cut over there to her.

3034
02:08:13,380 --> 02:08:15,190
I'll look at it.
That's gross.

3035
02:08:15,191 --> 02:08:18,430
Go to that one when she's lying down.
And it looks so weird.

3036
02:08:18,431 --> 02:08:20,190
The one that you had just before?
No.

3037
02:08:20,500 --> 02:08:22,390
The one with her.
Her tits up in the air.

3038
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,400
These bizarre photos.
Man.

3039
02:08:27,250 --> 02:08:29,830
That one.
But what's that?

3040
02:08:31,320 --> 02:08:32,780
Panic.
She looks fucking.

3041
02:08:33,100 --> 02:08:35,730
This is awful.
Stop fucking me please.

3042
02:08:36,040 --> 02:08:37,360
Boobs are awful.
Yeah,

3043
02:08:37,361 --> 02:08:38,290
it looks good.
That's wack.

3044
02:08:38,350 --> 02:08:40,510
It's garbage.
If you were dating a girl and you really

3045
02:08:40,511 --> 02:08:42,280
liked her,
she just happened at boobs like that.

3046
02:08:42,281 --> 02:08:44,230
You'd have to go.
Do you?

3047
02:08:44,910 --> 02:08:45,743
Do you want to get those taken out?
You want to get a reduction on like 

3048
02:08:48,670 --> 02:08:49,780
normal?
Yeah.

3049
02:08:49,781 --> 02:08:50,351
That looks at.
It.

3050
02:08:50,351 --> 02:08:51,490
Looks at what is the vagina like?

3051
02:08:51,520 --> 02:08:52,720
Did they show it?
They don't show it,

3052
02:08:52,840 --> 02:08:54,490
but look at the waist.
Look at how fucked up that is.

3053
02:08:54,491 --> 02:08:55,750
That it will go back real quick.
Sorry.

3054
02:08:56,050 --> 02:08:58,900
That image of her waist is like,
it's like a 12 inch waist.

3055
02:08:58,930 --> 02:09:00,130
I mean,
that's fucking creepy.

3056
02:09:00,131 --> 02:09:01,360
Yeah.
But that's what they want.

3057
02:09:01,400 --> 02:09:02,233
You're like fully exaggerated features.
So going back to we were talking about 

3058
02:09:06,550 --> 02:09:07,383
you want to talk about like this,
that goes back to this core set of core 

3059
02:09:10,581 --> 02:09:10,920
said,
whoa,

3060
02:09:10,920 --> 02:09:13,780
look at her waist.
That goes back to this creepy psychology

3061
02:09:13,781 --> 02:09:14,614
of what the figure and men's minds 
socially we that has been pushed out 

3062
02:09:18,431 --> 02:09:22,240
that you want this hourglass thing.
And did they show you video?

3063
02:09:22,330 --> 02:09:24,680
I want to see video girl looks real.
That one down.

3064
02:09:24,830 --> 02:09:25,470
Uh,
the,

3065
02:09:25,470 --> 02:09:26,530
the,
where it says new,

3066
02:09:26,590 --> 02:09:27,423
the first new to the left.
That photo kind of looks real right 

3067
02:09:30,431 --> 02:09:31,600
there while the first one did.

3068
02:09:32,140 --> 02:09:33,280
Yeah.
Like that looks weird.

3069
02:09:33,330 --> 02:09:36,160
That look real far away.
It looks crazy.

3070
02:09:36,161 --> 02:09:39,010
Real.
That was a girl's instagram profile.

3071
02:09:39,240 --> 02:09:40,780
Yeah.
You wouldn'T think twice.

3072
02:09:41,710 --> 02:09:43,090
She has an instagram page.
This.

3073
02:09:43,240 --> 02:09:46,450
Oh my god.
But then again,

3074
02:09:46,451 --> 02:09:49,480
how many followers jamie,
look at the size of those fake tits.

3075
02:09:49,481 --> 02:09:52,270
There's so ridiculous.
Can you imagine following this?

3076
02:09:52,271 --> 02:09:53,350
What does your,
what does your wife say?

3077
02:09:53,380 --> 02:09:55,830
Well,
I saw that followed one person.

3078
02:09:57,370 --> 02:09:58,270
Go to the upper.
Okay,

3079
02:09:58,271 --> 02:10:00,940
go to the right hand side.
That one with the giant tits.

3080
02:10:01,240 --> 02:10:04,200
That is so ridiculous.
Petite japanese cooling.

3081
02:10:05,020 --> 02:10:10,020
They love that shit.
Hot battery battery inside me.

3082
02:10:12,671 --> 02:10:14,500
Keep me hot.
I'm so hot.

3083
02:10:14,501 --> 02:10:16,150
I take off my clothes.
Why fit?

3084
02:10:16,190 --> 02:10:17,023
So a bank is here.
I can just hear like a asian listeners 

3085
02:10:18,671 --> 02:10:19,680
tuning out.
Like this is just.

3086
02:10:19,790 --> 02:10:20,623
I can't take this anymore.
As I go to the one on the upper left 

3087
02:10:26,501 --> 02:10:27,910
hand corner,
the top first,

3088
02:10:27,911 --> 02:10:30,130
first image of the a way go down.

3089
02:10:30,750 --> 02:10:33,440
We'll get that one right there.
Look at that one.

3090
02:10:33,650 --> 02:10:37,610
What the fuck man?
Like why are they so big?

3091
02:10:38,330 --> 02:10:39,163
Because this is what they.
I guess the idea is that the kind of 

3092
02:10:42,501 --> 02:10:43,334
people that are Going to buy these are 
the kind of people that are either 

3093
02:10:45,921 --> 02:10:48,630
addicted to porn or anime porn.
I always say that.

3094
02:10:48,650 --> 02:10:50,390
I would say it's because they don't get 
anything ever,

3095
02:10:50,391 --> 02:10:52,010
so they have to go.
Click on.

3096
02:10:52,040 --> 02:10:53,030
Click on the image.
one more time,

3097

Why you liking photos?

3103
02:11:15,650 --> 02:11:17,630
Good job on these guys now.

3104
02:11:17,631 --> 02:11:18,920

There's going to get gross.

3105
02:11:18,950 --> 02:11:19,190
Okay.

3106
02:11:19,190 --> 02:11:20,120
Just for us.
Yeah,

3107
02:11:20,140 --> 02:11:21,350
they don't.
People don't get to see that.

3108
02:11:21,351 --> 02:11:22,184
No,
but let me see if there's a video of 

3109
02:11:23,781 --> 02:11:26,270
these things moving.
This is what I want to see.

3110
02:11:26,330 --> 02:11:28,700
I want to see that.
They're just lying there.

3111
02:11:28,701 --> 02:11:33,200
I'm thinking that they're inanimate.
So these sex robots,

3112
02:11:33,290 --> 02:11:35,570
when you call them robots,
do they move?

3113
02:11:35,970 --> 02:11:36,321
No,
no,

3114
02:11:36,321 --> 02:11:36,941
no,
no,

3115
02:11:36,941 --> 02:11:37,161
no,
no,

3116
02:11:37,161 --> 02:11:37,481
no,
no,

3117
02:11:37,481 --> 02:11:37,850
no,
no.

3118
02:11:37,850 --> 02:11:38,541
it's not.
No,

3119
02:11:38,541 --> 02:11:40,580
they're not called robots.
They're called sex dolls.

3120
02:11:40,610 --> 02:11:42,890
It's a doll.
I've heard about a doll.

3121
02:11:42,891 --> 02:11:45,470
But these are sex robot.
This as kinky doll.

3122
02:11:45,560 --> 02:11:46,790
These are sex dolls,
right?

3123
02:11:46,791 --> 02:11:50,000
But the ones in toronto,
houston robot.

3124
02:11:50,030 --> 02:11:51,390
This is the same company.
So this,

3125
02:11:51,430 --> 02:11:52,170
this is.
Yeah.

3126
02:11:52,170 --> 02:11:54,470
It's just sex dolls.
So they don't move kinky.

3127
02:11:54,471 --> 02:11:56,060
Estelle was a bull or something like 
that.

3128
02:11:56,090 --> 02:11:57,920
So I don't think they owe their posable.
Yeah.

3129
02:11:58,380 --> 02:11:59,300
Yeah.
What he's doing.

3130
02:11:59,310 --> 02:12:01,040
Her dirty looks really painful.

3131
02:12:01,600 --> 02:12:02,810
He's grabbing her.
Listen to me.

3132
02:12:03,180 --> 02:12:04,013
Let me open Your mouth.
Can get this off the fucking screen for 

3133
02:12:07,441 --> 02:12:09,370
I vomit.
Oh.

3134
02:12:09,590 --> 02:12:10,490
Oh.
What are you doing?

3135
02:12:10,491 --> 02:12:13,070
They're checking the seeds of sex robots
contacting you.

3136
02:12:13,190 --> 02:12:14,460
I just got to Texas.
I was like,

3137
02:12:14,580 --> 02:12:17,240
sex doll talk.
What the fuck is wrong with you guys?

3138
02:12:17,940 --> 02:12:18,980
Yeah,
exactly.

3139
02:12:19,040 --> 02:12:19,873
Fuck,
I'll talk.

3140
02:12:19,880 --> 02:12:21,590
Hey man,
we're not the ones that are using it.

3141
02:12:21,591 --> 02:12:26,591
He's drunk folks.
He's been drinking in my face.

3142
02:12:27,150 --> 02:12:27,983
I'm going to.
I'm going to drink more in front of 

3143
02:12:29,031 --> 02:12:29,864
rogan.
I'm going to smoke pot and I'm going to 

3144
02:12:31,071 --> 02:12:34,130
upset my investors and I'm going to get 
everybody mad.

3145
02:12:34,250 --> 02:12:37,690
I have 20 days.
You motherfuckers to zero.

3146
02:12:37,940 --> 02:12:38,773
We got.
What we really have to do though for 

3147
02:12:39,641 --> 02:12:40,474
real is when it's up like the party.
You have to throw like a fucking huge 

3148
02:12:43,371 --> 02:12:44,390
party.
A party.

3149
02:12:44,510 --> 02:12:45,320
You throw a party.

3150
02:12:45,320 --> 02:12:46,670
Fucking one sober.
October is over.

3151
02:12:46,700 --> 02:12:47,850
Where?
Here?

3152
02:12:48,050 --> 02:12:49,700
Why here?
Why?

3153
02:12:49,910 --> 02:12:51,080
For us?
Oh,

3154
02:12:51,620 --> 02:12:55,040
it's a party.
This is what I want for food.

3155
02:12:55,041 --> 02:12:55,874
I want dogs kielbasa.
These following things I would like to 

3156
02:12:58,701 --> 02:13:00,710
enjoy at your party.
I like the thick crust.

3157
02:13:00,711 --> 02:13:03,040
Pizza.
Deep day shift.

3158
02:13:03,050 --> 02:13:06,820
A chicago style dude,
go get me polish over there.

3159
02:13:06,821 --> 02:13:07,654
from.
From,

3160
02:13:07,710 --> 02:13:11,150
from my.
From marco is in chicago.

3161
02:13:11,151 --> 02:13:11,984
Was really fun because you could tell 
like you were in your element so much 

3162
02:13:14,811 --> 02:13:18,200
for taking deep breaths.
I was wonderful.

3163
02:13:18,201 --> 02:13:19,760
Fucking chicago.
I love iT.

3164
02:13:19,761 --> 02:13:21,680
here we went to a bar.
We got steaks.

3165
02:13:21,740 --> 02:13:22,573
Like the best part.
We walk out of a state of good 

3166
02:13:24,801 --> 02:13:26,420
steakhouse in this guy.
Go of chicago,

3167
02:13:26,421 --> 02:13:29,120
black hawk who I'm a huge fan of.
Comes up to joe and he's like,

3168
02:13:29,450 --> 02:13:31,980
joe rogan.
Joe rogan and he couldn't

3169
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:33,210
believe you were there and you're like,
what's up man?

3170
02:13:33,211 --> 02:13:36,190
He's like,
I'm a chicago black hawk.

3171
02:13:36,191 --> 02:13:37,030
You're like,
all right.

3172
02:13:37,320 --> 02:13:39,330
He was like,
cool,

3173
02:13:39,510 --> 02:13:40,950
and you're like,
all man,

3174
02:13:40,980 --> 02:13:43,020
you turned them in to you.
Who was that guy?

3175
02:13:43,260 --> 02:13:45,360
I was like,
that's a fucking chicago blackhawks,

3176
02:13:45,390 --> 02:13:46,230
and I was like,
oh yeah,

3177
02:13:46,231 --> 02:13:49,080
joe doesn't give a fuck about.
No.

3178
02:13:49,200 --> 02:13:49,570
Yeah,
no,

3179
02:13:49,570 --> 02:13:51,180
I'm saying you didn't know it was nice.
The guy.

3180
02:13:51,220 --> 02:13:52,021
Oh,
you're super nice.

3181
02:13:52,021 --> 02:13:54,810
But I was like,
that's so funny to think that like those

3182
02:13:54,811 --> 02:13:55,644
guys are dead.
How he treated you was how people treat 

3183
02:13:59,401 --> 02:14:00,300
him.
Do you know what I mean?

3184
02:14:00,301 --> 02:14:03,940
It was wild to watch how people treat 
athletes when they're like pro,

3185
02:14:03,950 --> 02:14:05,890
you're my favorite.
This guy was like,

3186
02:14:05,970 --> 02:14:07,350
he became a kid again.
He was like,

3187
02:14:07,410 --> 02:14:08,243
oh my god,
joe rogen to this restaurant that I 

3188
02:14:09,001 --> 02:14:10,500
fucking love to go to.
It was,

3189
02:14:10,680 --> 02:14:12,300
it was cool to be on the outside of 
that,

3190
02:14:12,301 --> 02:14:13,134
to watch that happen.
Especially because I'm such a chicago 

3191
02:14:15,170 --> 02:14:16,770
blackhawks and like I'm such a sports 
fan,

3192
02:14:16,980 --> 02:14:17,813
so it was just so weird to watch an 
athlete kinda act like people acted 

3193
02:14:21,260 --> 02:14:22,170
them.
Do you know what I mean?

3194
02:14:22,200 --> 02:14:23,820
It was fucking,
it was just beautiful to watch.

3195
02:14:23,820 --> 02:14:23,910
It was the

3196
02:14:23,910 --> 02:14:26,070
weirdest thing that has come out of this
podcast is.

3197
02:14:26,071 --> 02:14:28,140
And,
and again this is not just for men,

3198
02:14:28,170 --> 02:14:30,140
the podcast is for whoever the fuck legs
it,

3199
02:14:30,420 --> 02:14:35,420
but men don't get a whole lot of 
examples of men that are allowed to just

3200
02:14:35,731 --> 02:14:37,320
be themselves be guys.
Yeah.

3201
02:14:37,410 --> 02:14:39,870
Just because everybody's worried about 
getting fired from something.

3202
02:14:39,900 --> 02:14:40,733
Yup.
Everybody's worried about saying the 

3203
02:14:41,731 --> 02:14:42,564
wrong thing.
Or like when I said that I'd like that 

3204
02:14:44,401 --> 02:14:47,370
song that girls sang.
I really like it.

3205
02:14:47,580 --> 02:14:48,413
Yeah.
It's a good song and I think she's got 

3206
02:14:49,381 --> 02:14:50,214
really good points.
I'm not saying it so that someone likes 

3207
02:14:51,931 --> 02:14:53,100
me more.
I'm not.

3208
02:14:53,101 --> 02:14:55,800
I mean,
I'm saying like maybe as men,

3209
02:14:55,801 --> 02:14:57,690
especially me as a guy with three 
daughters,

3210
02:14:57,750 --> 02:14:58,583
you should see,
I should consider and we should all 

3211
02:15:00,870 --> 02:15:03,020
consider what it's like to be a girl,
you know,

3212
02:15:03,030 --> 02:15:04,530
and I've talked to girls who have been 
drugged.

3213
02:15:04,530 --> 02:15:07,980
I've talked to girls who've had guys 
creep on them and do creepy shit to them

3214
02:15:07,981 --> 02:15:09,420
and girls that have been sexually 
assaulted.

3215
02:15:09,840 --> 02:15:11,670
I liked that.
I liked that song.

3216
02:15:11,790 --> 02:15:13,530
I like it.
Not that I like sexual assault.

3217
02:15:13,531 --> 02:15:17,280
I meant I liked that song.
This is going to get cut up.

3218
02:15:17,281 --> 02:15:18,114
I like it.
Is it?

3219
02:15:18,330 --> 02:15:19,890
It's going to get edited out of the 
context for sure.

3220
02:15:20,250 --> 02:15:21,250
I,
I liked,

3221
02:15:21,700 --> 02:15:26,700
I liked this woman expressing herself in
an artistic way that represents the real

3222
02:15:26,881 --> 02:15:29,340
threat that women face and it's also a 
catchy song.

3223
02:15:29,350 --> 02:15:31,140
She's got a beautiful voice and I'm 
still a man.

3224
02:15:31,350 --> 02:15:31,771
Yeah,
you're still.

3225
02:15:31,771 --> 02:15:34,140
It's okay.
These things are allowed to coexist.

3226
02:15:34,141 --> 02:15:36,120
You don't.
You don't somehow or another become some

3227
02:15:36,121 --> 02:15:39,290
sort of a cook or a pussy or it doesn't 
mean that you're,

3228
02:15:39,770 --> 02:15:40,603
you're a loser or that your.
We all know when someone's faking 

3229
02:15:44,880 --> 02:15:45,713
something,
when they're giving in totally pressure 

3230
02:15:47,670 --> 02:15:51,000
and pretending like actress,
use the word wonderful.

3231
02:15:51,470 --> 02:15:53,340
Describe a woman's performance.
What we were talking about.

3232
02:15:53,950 --> 02:15:56,800
We no fake shit.
We no fake shit and it was very good.

3233
02:15:56,850 --> 02:15:58,620
Too much goddamn fake shit in this 
world.

3234
02:15:58,830 --> 02:15:59,663
So one of the more interesting things 
that's come out of this podcast is 

3235
02:16:02,280 --> 02:16:07,280
because I don't have a person telling me
what to do and I can just be myself.

3236
02:16:08,490 --> 02:16:10,380
People like guys go,
oh,

3237
02:16:10,470 --> 02:16:14,390
this is like hanging out.
This is what it would be if we were just

3238
02:16:14,480 --> 02:16:16,650
hanging out,
but people are listening,

3239
02:16:16,800 --> 02:16:19,170
right?
But normal things.

3240
02:16:19,410 --> 02:16:22,420
You don't get to just hang out because 
when people are listening,

3241
02:16:22,560 --> 02:16:26,040
then you've got to tone the language.
she say she can't say things.

3242
02:16:26,190 --> 02:16:29,920
Don't say careful.
Don't say it to say that word.

3243
02:16:30,520 --> 02:16:31,353
You know why?
Because there's so much misconstrued 

3244
02:16:32,291 --> 02:16:33,124
nonsense people because people are 
allowed to take any opinion that you 

3245
02:16:35,861 --> 02:16:37,600
have because they don't know your full 
opinion.

3246
02:16:37,600 --> 02:16:38,433
They knew a piece of what you think here
and they just ripped that out and throw 

3247
02:16:40,661 --> 02:16:43,840
that into fucking space.
It's recreAtional outrage.

3248
02:16:43,990 --> 02:16:44,823
That's what they're there.
They're finding a nice little juicy 

3249
02:16:46,331 --> 02:16:47,260
target like,
oh,

3250
02:16:47,261 --> 02:16:51,340
let's go after it and it'll be whatever 
the fuck it is when whoever's next,

3251
02:16:51,341 --> 02:16:52,174
whether it's chris hardwick or who or 
whoever gets called out for something 

3252
02:16:54,941 --> 02:16:56,740
and someone whether they're guilty or 
not,

3253
02:16:56,741 --> 02:16:59,700
who gives a shit,
let's pile on to that motherfucker right

3254
02:16:59,950 --> 02:17:00,783
and ruin their life for a couple of 
weeks and this is what's going on in 

3255
02:17:02,981 --> 02:17:05,500
this world and it's.
It's not good for anybody.

3256
02:17:05,510 --> 02:17:07,030
It's for men.
It's not good for women.

3257
02:17:07,060 --> 02:17:09,160
There's only one good piece of it at 
all.

3258
02:17:09,220 --> 02:17:11,920
If you are a piece of shit like harvey 
weinstein,

3259
02:17:12,010 --> 02:17:14,110
if you're a fucking turd and your rape 
women,

3260
02:17:14,140 --> 02:17:14,973
yes,
then you're going to get got and it's 

3261
02:17:16,061 --> 02:17:18,220
good that you got got,
but even him,

3262
02:17:18,221 --> 02:17:19,054
man,
have you seen the new article article 

3263
02:17:21,371 --> 02:17:24,190
where the woman who is accusing him of 
sexual assault,

3264
02:17:24,430 --> 02:17:25,263
the da is talking about throwing it out 
of court now because they found a 

3265
02:17:30,040 --> 02:17:31,060
computer log.

3266
02:17:31,510 --> 02:17:34,270
The girls who was accusing harvey 
weinstein,

3267
02:17:34,271 --> 02:17:36,910
one of them have actual sexual assault.
I will send it to you,

3268
02:17:36,911 --> 02:17:39,820
jamie,
so that you can pull it up.

3269
02:17:40,090 --> 02:17:45,090
It was on the New York post page six.
It was on page six yesterday.

3270
02:17:47,980 --> 02:17:49,870
Judge dismisses one.
Is that today?

3271
02:17:50,440 --> 02:17:51,520
Okay.
So this is.

3272
02:17:51,521 --> 02:17:52,354
They did,
they decided to dismiss it because this 

3273
02:17:54,851 --> 02:17:57,570
woman had a uh,
uh,

3274
02:17:58,000 --> 02:17:58,833
she,
they got ahold of her computer because 

3275
02:18:00,641 --> 02:18:04,090
of her former employer or a former 
employee,

3276
02:18:04,850 --> 02:18:06,970
a who said,
look,

3277
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:09,580
this is not how this girl describe this 
aisle.

3278
02:18:09,590 --> 02:18:12,580
I want tO watch the video.
She failed the boards.

3279
02:18:12,581 --> 02:18:14,260
Have video of them having a 
conversation,

3280
02:18:14,261 --> 02:18:15,640
right?
I don't think so.

3281
02:18:15,700 --> 02:18:19,420
This is a different one.
This is a girl who gave harvey weinstein

3282
02:18:19,421 --> 02:18:20,950
a blow job.
And she said,

3283
02:18:20,980 --> 02:18:21,813
look,
I'm going to send you the actual thing 

3284
02:18:23,021 --> 02:18:24,250
that I got here.
Jamie,

3285
02:18:24,310 --> 02:18:24,530
hold on.

3286
02:18:24,530 --> 02:18:25,450
I'm sorry.
Give me one second.

3287
02:18:25,950 --> 02:18:30,950
um,
and her former employee was like,

3288
02:18:32,740 --> 02:18:36,610
this is not what she said.
This is not what she said to me.

3289
02:18:37,180 --> 02:18:38,013
And they were,
there were saying that it was in danger 

3290
02:18:40,001 --> 02:18:42,070
of being thrown out and now it is thrown
out.

3291
02:18:42,990 --> 02:18:47,740
So she lied about what it was.
So the judge was like,

3292
02:18:47,741 --> 02:18:49,600
fuck this shit yet.
Well don,

3293
02:18:49,630 --> 02:18:53,980
they essentially said that this is just,
she look,

3294
02:18:54,040 --> 02:18:58,990
there are actual sexual assault victims 
and then there are people,

3295
02:18:59,680 --> 02:19:02,830
there's also people I think that are 
crazy,

3296
02:19:03,130 --> 02:19:03,963
but you don't have a real accurate 
memory of things that have happened and 

3297
02:19:09,731 --> 02:19:10,564
so they can paint themselves as a victim
and be deceptive about it in 

3298
02:19:14,440 --> 02:19:16,780
voluntarily.
I think that's entirely possible.

3299
02:19:16,800 --> 02:19:17,633
Sure.
I think there's a certain amount of 

3300
02:19:18,071 --> 02:19:21,160
people that are just delusional and they
just don't see things accurately.

3301
02:19:21,280 --> 02:19:22,630
Did you get the texts that I sent you?

3302
02:19:23,640 --> 02:19:24,473
But I also,
but you all.

3303
02:19:24,490 --> 02:19:26,970
But I also still know that harvey 
weinstein is,

3304
02:19:27,290 --> 02:19:28,123
is a fucking a sexual assault.
There's just too many women that are 

3305
02:19:30,411 --> 02:19:34,940
saying that he forced himself on them 
and he did an audio of him without girl.

3306
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:36,830
You heard that audio?
I heard of it.

3307
02:19:36,831 --> 02:19:39,200
I didn't listen to some of the 
transcripts,

3308
02:19:39,350 --> 02:19:42,140
but there was also that um,
so I'll make this bigger.

3309
02:19:42,141 --> 02:19:45,260
So my stupid old eyes can see it.
You say old eyes,

3310
02:19:45,261 --> 02:19:46,850
I can get bigger too.
Um,

3311
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:50,660
she accused weinstein of forcing her to 
perform oral sex,

3312
02:19:50,960 --> 02:19:54,530
but a prior employee of evan's turned 
over personal writing.

3313
02:19:54,531 --> 02:19:55,364
She'd left in the company's computer,
which appeared to contradict the grand 

3314
02:19:57,291 --> 02:19:58,124
jury testimony.
The writings indicated was consensual 

3315
02:20:00,621 --> 02:20:03,470
friendly.
A source told the post that has caused a

3316
02:20:03,471 --> 02:20:06,050
split in the manhattan manhattan 
district attorney's office.

3317
02:20:06,051 --> 02:20:06,884
Some believe the charges should be 
dropped if there's a problem with this 

3318
02:20:08,751 --> 02:20:09,290
complaint.

3319
02:20:09,290 --> 02:20:11,000
And then it was just so it was dropped.
Yeah,

3320
02:20:11,180 --> 02:20:12,110
there you go.
Listen,

3321
02:20:13,040 --> 02:20:14,840
it's the whole.
It's hard.

3322
02:20:14,870 --> 02:20:16,710
It's hard man,
because like you,

3323
02:20:16,870 --> 02:20:18,860
you don't want to say,
oh,

3324
02:20:18,861 --> 02:20:21,920
these girls were all lying because 
they're not of course.

3325
02:20:21,921 --> 02:20:24,260
But one of them could be lying.
Sure.

3326
02:20:24,560 --> 02:20:26,360
Yeah.
And when one of them's lying,

3327
02:20:26,390 --> 02:20:29,090
they've got to do what they did and 
throw that case out.

3328
02:20:29,270 --> 02:20:31,030
But then he's going to say,
look,

3329
02:20:31,040 --> 02:20:33,740
it's all fabricated.
Well,

3330
02:20:34,610 --> 02:20:38,390
there's people that will be opportunists
in the face of a scandal.

3331
02:20:38,540 --> 02:20:39,373
So There's a scandal where someone is 
actually legitimately done awful things 

3332
02:20:42,080 --> 02:20:42,913
and someone is going to stand up and say
he did awful things to me when really 

3333
02:20:45,471 --> 02:20:47,840
they just fuck the guy because they 
wanted to advance their career.

3334
02:20:47,870 --> 02:20:48,770
You're right.
I would,

3335
02:20:48,880 --> 02:20:49,713
I would,
I would always argue the majority of 

3336
02:20:51,621 --> 02:20:56,300
people that get involved in this thing 
probably aren't full of shit.

3337
02:20:56,630 --> 02:21:00,950
There is always is always going to be 
people that want to capitalize.

3338
02:21:00,980 --> 02:21:02,860
There's a,
there's a real problem.

3339
02:21:02,900 --> 02:21:03,733
Human nature.
People do that all the time in every 

3340
02:21:04,791 --> 02:21:05,624
facet.
And that people that lied about 

3341
02:21:07,250 --> 02:21:08,083
September 11th where they were,
these people environmentally lie about 

3342
02:21:10,551 --> 02:21:13,180
everything.
But I think there's power.

3343
02:21:14,030 --> 02:21:15,020
Oh,
not matt lauer,

3344
02:21:15,021 --> 02:21:16,430
the other guy.
Brian williams.

3345
02:21:16,690 --> 02:21:17,211
William,
sorry.

3346
02:21:17,211 --> 02:21:17,571
Yeah,
yeah,

3347
02:21:17,571 --> 02:21:18,220
yeah.
He loved.

3348
02:21:18,220 --> 02:21:19,053
Well,
it wasn't just hillary clinton lied 

3349
02:21:19,821 --> 02:21:20,860
about it to come.
Remember?

3350
02:21:20,950 --> 02:21:21,783
Yeah.
She lied about a bullets were flying 

3351
02:21:22,851 --> 02:21:24,090
buyer and people were like,
no,

3352
02:21:24,130 --> 02:21:24,790
no,
no,

3353
02:21:24,790 --> 02:21:25,081
no,
no.

3354
02:21:25,081 --> 02:21:26,060
There's no bullets.
Nope.

3355
02:21:26,210 --> 02:21:28,850
We didn't have anywhere near political.
Remember that wasn't that.

3356
02:21:28,880 --> 02:21:29,713
There's something about hillary clinton 
lied about being in the middle of a 

3357
02:21:33,950 --> 02:21:35,360
gunfire situation.
Looking people,

3358
02:21:35,690 --> 02:21:37,310
they,
they exaggerate.

3359
02:21:37,400 --> 02:21:38,233
They make things up and some people are 
just full of shit and then there's 

3360
02:21:40,671 --> 02:21:41,504
people that are delusional and they have
a problem with reality and they might 

3361
02:21:45,440 --> 02:21:47,750
legitimately believe it's something 
awful happened to them.

3362
02:21:47,920 --> 02:21:48,753
There.
There are people that do things like 

3363
02:21:49,611 --> 02:21:52,430
that,
like it's not all deceptive.

3364
02:21:52,520 --> 02:21:53,353
There's people that have legitimate 
mental issues and they have a paranoid 

3365
02:21:57,561 --> 02:21:59,780
schizophrenia to whatever extent,
you know,

3366
02:21:59,781 --> 02:22:04,781
whether it's mild or horrible,
but they have a delusional perception of

3367
02:22:05,931 --> 02:22:06,764
the world around them.
They think people are out to get them 

3368
02:22:07,970 --> 02:22:08,803
totally,
and then those people get caught up in 

3369
02:22:10,181 --> 02:22:11,210
the mix.
There's also,

3370
02:22:11,240 --> 02:22:12,830
there's also selective memory,
right?

3371
02:22:12,831 --> 02:22:14,840
There's also manipulation of selective 
memory.

3372
02:22:14,841 --> 02:22:15,500
there's,
there's,

3373
02:22:15,500 --> 02:22:18,440
there's a lot of study about people that
have convinced themselves that something

3374
02:22:18,441 --> 02:22:19,274
happened,
but It really didn't happen that that's 

3375
02:22:20,151 --> 02:22:20,984
a real thing.
They really believe and they're not 

3376
02:22:22,821 --> 02:22:26,340
lying because in their brain that is 
literally with their brain has

3377
02:22:26,910 --> 02:22:30,390
kind of categorize and formulated was 
that thing did happen.

3378
02:22:30,391 --> 02:22:31,224
They've told themselves that enough 
where it's been convinced in their own 

3379
02:22:32,761 --> 02:22:34,440
mind that it did happen

3380
02:22:35,310 --> 02:22:36,143
to.
Someone's trying to explain that about 

3381
02:22:37,500 --> 02:22:38,333
oj.
They were saying that oj has lied so 

3382
02:22:39,811 --> 02:22:43,770
many times about what happened that 
night that he might in his own mind,

3383
02:22:43,980 --> 02:22:45,390
he didn't actually believe he didn't do 
it.

3384
02:22:45,420 --> 02:22:47,970
That's wild as fuck,
but the human memory,

3385
02:22:47,971 --> 02:22:51,430
like neil degrasse tyson was trying to 
explain this to me that when you,

3386
02:22:51,440 --> 02:22:53,790
when you were taught,
when you're talking about memory,

3387
02:22:53,900 --> 02:22:58,580
you are literally talking about the 
worst form of evidence that we know of.

3388
02:22:59,890 --> 02:23:02,460
The memory.
Your memory is.

3389
02:23:02,760 --> 02:23:03,593
First of all,
your memory really is your memory of 

3390
02:23:06,211 --> 02:23:08,430
your memory.
It's not even your memory.

3391
02:23:08,460 --> 02:23:09,293
It's a memory of you recounting what you
used to remember and then sort of 

3392
02:23:12,901 --> 02:23:15,720
reestablishing it in your narrative of 
the past.

3393
02:23:15,800 --> 02:23:16,260
RighT.
It's,

3394
02:23:16,260 --> 02:23:20,060
it's a recounting of a thing you tried 
to recount.

3395
02:23:20,220 --> 02:23:21,960
Yeah,
like I'm pretty sure when that girl blew

3396
02:23:21,961 --> 02:23:22,830
me,
when I was 16,

3397
02:23:22,831 --> 02:23:26,340
I did have my ears ringing because I 
remember like,

3398
02:23:26,370 --> 02:23:27,990
wow,
that's crazy,

3399
02:23:27,991 --> 02:23:30,120
and it's never happened since,
but maybe not now.

3400
02:23:30,170 --> 02:23:31,920
I'm pretty sure it probably.
Yeah,

3401
02:23:31,980 --> 02:23:33,960
it happened.
Here's what I know.

3402
02:23:34,230 --> 02:23:35,063
She did rape me.
She didn't punch me in the face and hit 

3403
02:23:37,021 --> 02:23:39,840
me over the head with a frying pan to my
ears rang.

3404
02:23:40,350 --> 02:23:42,280
She didn't do that.
It will be funny.

3405
02:23:42,330 --> 02:23:43,163
Zero hit you over the head.
It'd be funny if my head went to the 

3406
02:23:46,111 --> 02:23:46,944
shape of a frying pan like those 
cartoons and then I had to go because 

3407
02:23:50,510 --> 02:23:53,940
you can see it's back to normal.
That's a hard.

3408
02:23:53,941 --> 02:23:55,360
I came.
My head was in a fried.

3409
02:23:59,940 --> 02:24:01,280
I don't know man.
It's.

3410
02:24:02,100 --> 02:24:03,600
Hi.
I'm optimistic.

3411
02:24:03,660 --> 02:24:07,580
This is what I think about when when 
people talk about the,

3412
02:24:07,700 --> 02:24:08,533
the the divide between men and women.
I don't see it that much in real life 

3413
02:24:13,110 --> 02:24:15,310
and they'll see it in my actual 
interactions on the internet.

3414
02:24:15,311 --> 02:24:16,144
I see it.
Yeah.

3415
02:24:16,270 --> 02:24:17,103
That's the problem with the internet.
The internet is just writing things and 

3416
02:24:19,351 --> 02:24:20,184
you're not being there with the person 
and talking to the person so you don't 

3417
02:24:22,891 --> 02:24:24,780
know if the people are writing things 
are reasonable.

3418
02:24:24,781 --> 02:24:27,270
You don't know if the people were angry.
No.

3419
02:24:27,300 --> 02:24:27,830
You don't know.

3420
02:24:27,830 --> 02:24:28,663
There's no legitimacy.
There's no legitimization to the 

3421
02:24:30,141 --> 02:24:34,220
internet anymore because it can come 
from memory one anywhere at any time and

3422
02:24:34,221 --> 02:24:35,380
the problem I have with,
with,

3423
02:24:35,430 --> 02:24:36,263
with,
with these growth movements that get 

3424
02:24:39,321 --> 02:24:42,350
like crazy is you're like,
are they talking to anybody else besides

3425
02:24:42,351 --> 02:24:43,184
their little internal group?
like are you talking to anybody other 

3426
02:24:45,501 --> 02:24:47,690
than the people that you know because if
you're not,

3427
02:24:47,720 --> 02:24:49,780
you're not getting any sort of outside 
opinion or sources.

3428
02:24:49,790 --> 02:24:52,310
You're just listening to people that 
agree with you already.

3429
02:24:52,360 --> 02:24:54,020
That the echo chamber thing is so 
annoying.

3430
02:24:54,021 --> 02:24:56,030
To me it's like as annoying on the same 
page.

3431
02:24:56,031 --> 02:24:56,670
It's like,
yeah,

3432
02:24:56,670 --> 02:24:58,010
stop that.
That doesn't.

3433
02:24:58,011 --> 02:25:00,170
That doesn't help any case at all.
Are you?

3434
02:25:00,410 --> 02:25:03,470
Are you actually trying to see what the 
other side is saying?

3435
02:25:03,500 --> 02:25:06,740
I think there are some people that do a 
good job.

3436
02:25:07,360 --> 02:25:08,193
I don't want to mention names of life,
but there are some people that I follow 

3437
02:25:09,771 --> 02:25:10,604
online that do a great job of like 
trying to have good discourse of right 

3438
02:25:13,971 --> 02:25:14,470
and left

3439
02:25:14,470 --> 02:25:15,970
like bill o'reilly.
Okay.

3440
02:25:18,230 --> 02:25:19,063
That was a guy.

3441
02:25:19,800 --> 02:25:20,633
I just think like there are some people 
that I like online that do have a good 

3442
02:25:23,470 --> 02:25:24,130
date fucking

3443
02:25:24,130 --> 02:25:26,190
balance it out,
but I.

3444
02:25:26,350 --> 02:25:29,730
BuT nowadays if you're.
But if you balance like you union,

3445
02:25:29,890 --> 02:25:33,400
you get criticized because you don't 
stick to one way.

3446
02:25:33,460 --> 02:25:34,720
Well,
here's what's interesting.

3447
02:25:35,370 --> 02:25:36,880
I tried to be very,
very balanced,

3448
02:25:37,030 --> 02:25:40,450
but I lean way more left than I do.
Right?

3449
02:25:40,510 --> 02:25:41,343
Way more left,
but you say that I get way more accused 

3450
02:25:46,240 --> 02:25:49,720
of being someone who favors the right 
quarter.

3451
02:25:49,730 --> 02:25:54,280
I left people right than I do.
Being someone who favors the left by,

3452
02:25:54,281 --> 02:25:55,114
right.
People who are outwardly espouse left 

3453
02:25:57,971 --> 02:26:01,780
wing ideas like universal basic income,
gay rights,

3454
02:26:01,781 --> 02:26:03,070
gay marriage,
women's rights.

3455
02:26:03,100 --> 02:26:05,620
Go down the line,
welfare,

3456
02:26:05,890 --> 02:26:08,200
food stamps.
I'm supportive of all these things,

3457
02:26:08,410 --> 02:26:09,243
but I get accused way more being a right
wing person by people on the left 

3458
02:26:13,601 --> 02:26:16,960
because do even of being a left wing 
person that people on the right.

3459
02:26:17,050 --> 02:26:20,890
When I say I'm left wing,
that's because that's because you don't.

3460
02:26:21,100 --> 02:26:23,380
You don't come.
The problem I have with the fly.

3461
02:26:23,410 --> 02:26:24,243
Yeah,
you don't comply.

3462
02:26:24,270 --> 02:26:26,080
I don't comply or don't comply.
I don't comply.

3463
02:26:26,090 --> 02:26:27,340
They get my.
That's my.

3464
02:26:27,480 --> 02:26:28,313
That's my biggest issue with any for any
far stretching side of the of political 

3465
02:26:31,631 --> 02:26:33,310
party.
When you don't comply,

3466
02:26:33,640 --> 02:26:34,473
they fucking get mad.
They get mad when we were talking about 

3467
02:26:37,211 --> 02:26:41,890
earlier that it is a form of fascism 
that they're trying to get you to figure

3468
02:26:42,310 --> 02:26:46,900
out what they want you to behave like,
how they want you to talk.

3469
02:26:47,140 --> 02:26:50,230
They want you to comply with that and 
stick to the script.

3470
02:26:50,560 --> 02:26:51,670
Fit in this box,
joe,

3471
02:26:51,700 --> 02:26:52,533
or you're not one of us.
Stick to the groove and we won't bitch 

3472
02:26:55,360 --> 02:26:57,900
because we don't do that shit.
You don't do that shit,

3473
02:26:58,220 --> 02:27:02,890
But b also because I know you fucks turn
on each other internally.

3474
02:27:02,891 --> 02:27:04,030
They fucking light each other up.

3475
02:27:04,750 --> 02:27:06,790
Is ever progressive enough?
Nope.

3476
02:27:06,940 --> 02:27:09,750
They will always try when they run out 
of targets that if,

3477
02:27:09,770 --> 02:27:10,603
if the whole world was progressive,
they would find people who are less 

3478
02:27:12,911 --> 02:27:14,170
progressive.
They were fine.

3479
02:27:14,171 --> 02:27:17,830
People who are not willing to suck that 
muslim,

3480
02:27:17,890 --> 02:27:19,690
queer,
gender,

3481
02:27:19,740 --> 02:27:22,670
nonbinary,
Iran secretary,

3482
02:27:23,110 --> 02:27:25,660
whatever,
whatever that guy's dick is because he's

3483
02:27:25,661 --> 02:27:27,130
a.
He has a penis.

3484
02:27:27,360 --> 02:27:30,450
You're some sort of a homophobes.
They would find a rezone.

3485
02:27:30,540 --> 02:27:31,030
Yeah,
that guy.

3486
02:27:31,030 --> 02:27:33,970
Glamour.
They'd find a reason for him forever for

3487
02:27:33,980 --> 02:27:35,810
them.
She them zero,

3488
02:27:36,030 --> 02:27:37,180
but that's what I mean like.
Yeah,

3489
02:27:37,480 --> 02:27:39,220
but I've talked about this shit on 
stage.

3490
02:27:39,221 --> 02:27:40,420
I'm not going to tell my joke,
but.

3491
02:27:41,460 --> 02:27:42,610
No,
but why can't.

3492
02:27:42,750 --> 02:27:44,050
Why?
Why the labels?

3493
02:27:44,440 --> 02:27:46,320
Yeah.
Why the labels just be your,

3494
02:27:46,380 --> 02:27:48,520
your own.
Because people like to be tribal.

3495
02:27:48,770 --> 02:27:49,860
That's right.
But.

3496
02:27:49,880 --> 02:27:54,520
But all that does is that categorize as 
you and then they get mad at category.

3497
02:27:54,700 --> 02:27:57,130
You want your,
you are subjecting yourself.

3498
02:27:57,160 --> 02:28:00,430
I didn't do that.
You told me you're the debt debt.

3499
02:28:00,431 --> 02:28:00,910
Debt,
debt,

3500
02:28:00,910 --> 02:28:02,470
debt.
I don't tell you joe.

3501
02:28:02,471 --> 02:28:03,304
I'm a white,
straight male who's irish and italian 

3502
02:28:05,050 --> 02:28:09,080
who loves her feet and a doggy style and
that.

3503
02:28:09,210 --> 02:28:11,400
And I'm also kind of catholic,
but you know,

3504
02:28:11,470 --> 02:28:13,840
my mom got a divorce so I can't be all 
the way.

3505
02:28:13,870 --> 02:28:14,703
Don't think that applies to a british 
iraqi gay nonbinary and also identifies 

3506
02:28:19,481 --> 02:28:22,070
as muslim person.
I think you're out of your life.

3507
02:28:22,880 --> 02:28:23,713
I identify as an irish italian,
straight white male from chicago who I 

3508
02:28:28,910 --> 02:28:30,200
just think we don't need all these 
labels.

3509
02:28:30,201 --> 02:28:32,750
You glamour.
You're allowed to be whoever you fucking

3510
02:28:32,751 --> 02:28:35,510
want to be and I support the fuck out of
who you are.

3511
02:28:35,780 --> 02:28:37,220
Always do your shit.
Well,

3512
02:28:37,221 --> 02:28:38,054
it's almost always people that don't 
have a lot of other things going for 

3513
02:28:40,101 --> 02:28:43,850
them because you have to,
like when someone says stephen hawkings,

3514
02:28:44,110 --> 02:28:47,960
identifying as a british identified as a
dead guy now when he was alive.

3515
02:28:47,980 --> 02:28:49,310
Yeah.
Brilliant.

3516
02:28:49,311 --> 02:28:53,570
British physicist slash heterosexual 
atheist,

3517
02:28:53,720 --> 02:28:57,400
a heterosexual identified who by the way
was um,

3518
02:28:57,560 --> 02:28:58,460
uh,
ribs of,

3519
02:28:58,820 --> 02:29:02,930
riddled with infidelity.
I've never met a guy so not capable of,

3520
02:29:03,040 --> 02:29:05,120
of cheating and found a way to cheat on 
his wife.

3521
02:29:05,150 --> 02:29:06,500
Well,
apparently you could still get it up.

3522
02:29:07,230 --> 02:29:08,063
Oh,
well apparently even though his body 

3523
02:29:09,710 --> 02:29:12,230
didn't move,
his could feel things.

3524
02:29:12,290 --> 02:29:13,890
That was his side.
The scientist,

3525
02:29:13,910 --> 02:29:17,690
he used to go to a.
Eric weinstein told me about this.

3526
02:29:17,691 --> 02:29:18,320
I was like,
what?

3527
02:29:18,320 --> 02:29:18,681
He's like,
yeah,

3528
02:29:18,681 --> 02:29:19,850
he's a freak.
And I was like,

3529
02:29:19,880 --> 02:29:20,810
wait,
what?

3530
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:21,621
And he's like,
yeah.

3531
02:29:21,621 --> 02:29:22,454
He used to go to strip clubs and there's
like videos of him like rolling into a 

3532
02:29:25,071 --> 02:29:27,620
strip club in the wheelchair.
Like he would go.

3533
02:29:27,650 --> 02:29:28,483
That was his thing.
Where'd you hear littered with 

3534
02:29:30,021 --> 02:29:31,000
infidelity?
What'd you hear?

3535
02:29:31,210 --> 02:29:32,960
That he cheated on his wife all the 
time.

3536
02:29:33,960 --> 02:29:36,920
We were in that fucking movie.
the whole reason that he.

3537
02:29:37,370 --> 02:29:39,020
Well,
I mean the whole reason that he left his

3538
02:29:39,021 --> 02:29:40,670
wife was because he fell in love with 
somebody else,

3539
02:29:40,671 --> 02:29:42,590
but wasn't it like a nurse?
There was taking care of it.

3540
02:29:42,591 --> 02:29:47,210
The truth was that he was the nurses.
If you google,

3541
02:29:48,710 --> 02:29:51,150
if you google stephen hawking,
he was affiliated.

3542
02:29:51,480 --> 02:29:52,590
He was always fucking around.

3543
02:29:54,220 --> 02:29:55,850
Come on man.
He was always fucking around.

3544
02:29:57,510 --> 02:29:58,343
Yeah.
Once he got a taste of the good light 

3545
02:29:59,670 --> 02:30:00,170
bulbs.
Yeah.

3546
02:30:00,170 --> 02:30:05,030
Once he got with that cosmology cash.
Yeah.

3547
02:30:06,080 --> 02:30:10,850
You know what also,
he's my back and a play by the rules.

3548
02:30:10,860 --> 02:30:13,620
The world dealt me the shittiest.
God please.

3549
02:30:13,850 --> 02:30:17,300
I'm a super genius and you know what?
I fucking agree.

3550
02:30:17,450 --> 02:30:20,580
Do whatever the fuck you want to do and 
you want to leave me lists.

3551
02:30:20,600 --> 02:30:23,300
You should leave me.
Why would you only fuck me?

3552
02:30:23,440 --> 02:30:24,300
Yeah.
I'm,

3553
02:30:24,860 --> 02:30:26,590
I'm,
I'm barely here.

3554
02:30:26,830 --> 02:30:29,450
I'm a machine now.
I use this finger to talk.

3555
02:30:30,670 --> 02:30:33,680
Know if somebody was his eyes and his 
fucking in his mouth.

3556
02:30:33,681 --> 02:30:34,910
At some point you couldn't even use his 
hands.

3557
02:30:34,911 --> 02:30:36,020
It was this size,
right?

3558
02:30:36,420 --> 02:30:38,990
Wasn't it as kind of a thing where he 
could kind of click?

3559
02:30:39,080 --> 02:30:39,920
He would do.
He would.

3560
02:30:39,950 --> 02:30:42,860
He would look at something too.
He had a thing where it was taken away.

3561
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:46,920
Then he would look at shit and it was 
me.

3562
02:30:46,921 --> 02:30:50,840
I want to see your ass hole.
Can you sit on my face?

3563
02:30:50,841 --> 02:30:52,820
Face face.
Don't kill me though,

3564
02:30:52,850 --> 02:30:54,680
man.
Figure out the universe.

3565
02:30:56,850 --> 02:31:01,850
Don't smother me with your pussy.
I need to figure out how stars are black

3566
02:31:02,841 --> 02:31:06,320
holes real or is it just a brown star?
Please?

3567
02:31:07,040 --> 02:31:10,580
I don't want to drown in your pussy.
I'm still on the subject of dark matter.

3568
02:31:10,910 --> 02:31:14,450
I'm trying to figure out the universe 
before I know in my pants.

3569
02:31:14,760 --> 02:31:15,593
That's the.
That's one of the strippers that he 

3570
02:31:16,460 --> 02:31:19,800
hooked up with was called dark matter.
Jada.

3571
02:31:20,400 --> 02:31:22,170
I'm trying to figure out.
Dark matter.

3572
02:31:22,320 --> 02:31:23,153
Dark matter.
I could see her with a big old fur coat 

3573
02:31:25,380 --> 02:31:30,380
long for a bush pickle message with a,
with a a pencil because she.

3574
02:31:31,570 --> 02:31:33,620
Her nails are too long.
Long text.

3575
02:31:33,640 --> 02:31:34,473
That dark matter.
Is that possible that you could grow 

3576
02:31:40,081 --> 02:31:42,120
your fingernails to girls with long 
nails?

3577
02:31:42,121 --> 02:31:43,530
They probably have a terrible time 
texting.

3578
02:31:43,560 --> 02:31:44,450
Well,
how did they touch with.

3579
02:31:44,451 --> 02:31:46,020
They try to touch with their finger.
Right?

3580
02:31:46,021 --> 02:31:48,420
But if you have a crazy ass long nails,
you'd be like,

3581
02:31:49,890 --> 02:31:51,660
oh,
I always text the whole time,

3582
02:31:51,661 --> 02:31:56,250
but then you gotta use your nose just to
get to the microphone thing.

3583
02:31:56,251 --> 02:31:57,084
That's what this is.
Just read about how this worked for red 

3584
02:31:59,911 --> 02:32:02,150
sensors on his glasses.
See what I'm saying?

3585
02:32:02,160 --> 02:32:04,110
I was on his eyeball movements in his 
cheek,

3586
02:32:04,111 --> 02:32:04,944
which then translated into a software 
program that allows them to navigate a 

3587
02:32:08,501 --> 02:32:12,750
system without his hands and then 
eventually turned into his speak as text

3588
02:32:12,751 --> 02:32:14,700
to speech.
I just want to fuck,

3589
02:32:15,140 --> 02:32:15,973
fuck,
fuck.

3590
02:32:16,160 --> 02:32:18,830
Speak functionality,
which takes text,

3591
02:32:19,040 --> 02:32:22,320
text and turns into speech in his iconic
voice.

3592
02:32:22,560 --> 02:32:23,393
Yeah.
He apparently he liked that voice and 

3593
02:32:25,051 --> 02:32:27,450
didn't want to upgrade it because like 
siri,

3594
02:32:27,690 --> 02:32:30,760
like if you talk to who do you,
do you have a specific kind of cereal.

3595
02:32:30,830 --> 02:32:32,700
My siri is an australian lady.
Like,

3596
02:32:33,270 --> 02:32:34,103
hey siri,

3597
02:32:38,780 --> 02:32:43,780
what's cracking bitch?
I don't know how to respond to that,

3598
02:32:48,220 --> 02:32:49,530
but that's what I have.
I have a.

3599
02:32:50,450 --> 02:32:50,910
Okay.

3600
02:32:50,910 --> 02:32:52,650
Does she love me?
Didn't she?

3601
02:32:53,220 --> 02:32:55,680
Would you like me to search the web for 
love?

3602
02:32:56,750 --> 02:32:57,960
that might've.
I think it's the same one.

3603
02:32:57,961 --> 02:32:59,280
It's british.
I think we have the same one.

3604
02:32:59,310 --> 02:33:01,890
I used to have an australian lady.
They swapped me out the new,

3605
02:33:01,891 --> 02:33:03,210
uh,
maybe they don't like Australia.

3606
02:33:03,840 --> 02:33:08,840
The new upgrade his voice in 2004.
It was a good enough stick with it.

3607
02:33:09,870 --> 02:33:13,290
This is how I talk.
I will always be this.

3608
02:33:13,790 --> 02:33:16,070
That man.
It was funny for.

3609
02:33:16,071 --> 02:33:17,520
You heard his voice.
He was like,

3610
02:33:17,580 --> 02:33:18,870
yo,
what's up with stephen hawking?

3611
02:33:19,640 --> 02:33:20,960
Real hardcore.
Yeah.

3612
02:33:20,980 --> 02:33:24,490
Like a super ghetto voice dose up to 
talk to you.

3613
02:33:24,491 --> 02:33:28,440
G up in this pitch out this 
motherfucking.

3614
02:33:29,730 --> 02:33:31,690
Fuck.
What's up with this door here?

3615
02:33:31,740 --> 02:33:32,573
drinking hennessy and coke.
Trying to find out what the fuck is 

3616
02:33:34,201 --> 02:33:38,040
happening with black matter.
Black matter is his.

3617
02:33:38,060 --> 02:33:39,780
That's his alter ego.
Black matter.

3618
02:33:39,870 --> 02:33:41,910
There'll be.
That would be a great stripper name.

3619
02:33:42,180 --> 02:33:46,850
Google sTripper.
Black matter stripper black exist.

3620

She does.
Or porn star first start with stripper.

3621
02:33:50,280 --> 02:33:51,113
Oh,
that's fine.

3622
02:33:51,300 --> 02:33:53,790
That might be a better porn star name.
Then stripper named black matter.

3623
02:33:54,900 --> 02:33:55,800
That will be out.
Actually,

3624
02:33:55,801 --> 02:33:58,200

They used to be a dark matter.

3628
02:34:04,081 --> 02:34:05,280
Lights that up.

3635
02:34:25,850 --> 02:34:28,260

02:34:28,270 --> 02:34:29,103

3665
02:35:30,190 --> 02:35:32,930
Like photos of the night.

3666
02:35:34,050 --> 02:35:37,650
what was going on on January 12th?
Look at that dude.

3667
02:35:37,651 --> 02:35:40,520
What is going on January 12th is that 
snoop dogg,

3668
02:35:40,580 --> 02:35:41,413
who's the guy with the white hood,
some fake snoop dogg will get them 

3669
02:35:44,540 --> 02:35:46,130
thuggish.
These are thuggish looking.

3670
02:35:46,131 --> 02:35:46,964
Oh,
he's got to look at whenever you got 

3671
02:35:48,321 --> 02:35:51,680
people that are standing there with 
fanning out hundred dollar bills,

3672
02:35:51,690 --> 02:35:54,440
like enjoys drinking Fiji water.
Yeah.

3673
02:35:54,441 --> 02:35:58,920
That's not my place.
Yeah.

3674
02:36:00,380 --> 02:36:03,020
I like all these girls to the main 
stage.

3675
02:36:03,021 --> 02:36:05,060
Dark matter,
living gentlemen,

3676
02:36:05,150 --> 02:36:08,050
dark matter,
get.

3677
02:36:08,420 --> 02:36:11,840
Who do you think was the first guy that 
came up with the strip club?

3678
02:36:11,841 --> 02:36:12,674
dj voice?

3679
02:36:12,780 --> 02:36:13,613
I don't know,
but that motherfucker has permeated the 

3680
02:36:14,461 --> 02:36:16,590
entire culture.
you can't hear that,

3681
02:36:16,980 --> 02:36:21,570
you know,
to the main come to the main stage.

3682
02:36:21,930 --> 02:36:24,180
Rain ladies and gentlemen.
It's river.

3683
02:36:24,390 --> 02:36:25,223
a nice round of applause for lexus.
how about a nice round of applause for 

3684
02:36:29,430 --> 02:36:30,263
kia sorento.
It's weird how things like that 

3685
02:36:35,761 --> 02:36:38,130
happened.
Like top 40 dj voiCe.

3686
02:36:38,160 --> 02:36:40,900
Very similar.
It's a similar voice but that.

3687
02:36:41,510 --> 02:36:42,930
But that's a weird thing.

3688
02:36:43,830 --> 02:36:47,550
How did broadcast journalism broadcast 
journalism in college and they teach you

3689
02:36:47,551 --> 02:36:49,470
that they teach you broadcast voice 
while.

3690
02:36:49,471 --> 02:36:51,330
I mean they kind of teach you about 
intonation,

3691
02:36:51,540 --> 02:36:55,380
so I think people get so stuck in that 
that they learn it and it like this,

3692
02:36:55,381 --> 02:37:00,381
like like web kit wbbm wk qx 95 nine.
It's the moose on the radio this morning

3693
02:37:01,131 --> 02:37:05,080
with joe rogan traffic at nine from lisa
guys today and it's,

3694
02:37:05,370 --> 02:37:06,203
it's the same rhythm.
They all have the exact same rhythm and 

3695
02:37:08,941 --> 02:37:09,774
I think it's just because it was learned
and then they hear other people do it 

3696
02:37:12,510 --> 02:37:14,820
and it's just such a monkey hear monkey 
do,

3697
02:37:15,240 --> 02:37:17,720
but there's a comfort level in imitating
it.

3698
02:37:18,020 --> 02:37:19,040
Well,
because it's rhythmic.

3699
02:37:19,041 --> 02:37:20,750
It's really isn't true.
I mean truly.

3700
02:37:20,751 --> 02:37:21,584
When they teach you in school,
they teach you about the rhythm of the 

3701
02:37:22,551 --> 02:37:24,080
voice.
What did they teach you?

3702
02:37:24,280 --> 02:37:25,160
Well,
they teach you that there's.

3703
02:37:25,190 --> 02:37:26,023
There's rhythmic waves too.
It's the exact same thing that happened 

3704
02:37:28,621 --> 02:37:30,320
to on air journalist,
like local news.

3705
02:37:30,680 --> 02:37:33,770
It's the same way when someone goes and 
on 95th street,

3706
02:37:33,980 --> 02:37:34,813
that's where it all went down.
They teach you about rhythmic ways to 

3707
02:37:37,281 --> 02:37:40,360
lead into the next piece.
They say it's be.

3708
02:37:40,470 --> 02:37:41,303
It teaches.
It teaches the listener or the watcher 

3709
02:37:43,850 --> 02:37:46,400
to get to be prepared for the next 
thing.

3710
02:37:46,401 --> 02:37:47,300
It's almost like a.

3711
02:37:47,920 --> 02:37:50,680
We,
I swear on god,

3712
02:37:50,840 --> 02:37:55,840
that dark matter search little farther 
and I've been real serious journalism.

3713
02:37:57,780 --> 02:37:59,070
No,
my shit's bullshit.

3714
02:37:59,071 --> 02:37:59,904
Give you what you really got.
Apparently a porn star named dark dark 

3715
02:38:02,221 --> 02:38:02,480
man.

3716
02:38:02,480 --> 02:38:03,750
Oh yeah.
Where is she?

3717
02:38:04,280 --> 02:38:05,470
They just teach you about rhythms 
because.

3718
02:38:05,530 --> 02:38:06,363
Because it's,
it's,

3719
02:38:06,630 --> 02:38:10,220
it's easy for the listener to hear in 
the morning to hear people go,

3720
02:38:10,710 --> 02:38:11,200
oh no,
no,

3721
02:38:11,200 --> 02:38:11,610
no,
no,

3722
02:38:11,610 --> 02:38:11,861
no,
no,

3723
02:38:11,861 --> 02:38:12,341
no,
no,

3724
02:38:12,341 --> 02:38:13,020
no,
no.

3725
02:38:13,020 --> 02:38:16,750
There's dark matter.
So there's also a featuring dark matter.

3726
02:38:16,751 --> 02:38:19,140
And is that a girl or a guy?
I'm not sure.

3727
02:38:19,230 --> 02:38:21,750
We'll get pornhub is just falling apart 
on us.

3728
02:38:21,790 --> 02:38:25,650
Like a bunch of parody.
I'm dark matter what is,

3729
02:38:25,680 --> 02:38:28,650
there's a thing that people do,
like jamie was on the phone once,

3730
02:38:28,740 --> 02:38:31,350
getting some tech information from this 
lady sounds right.

3731
02:38:31,380 --> 02:38:36,380
Put her on speaker phone while he's 
typing and she had the most annoyed,

3732
02:38:37,050 --> 02:38:39,840
you know that thing that people do.
It's called uptalk.

3733
02:38:39,930 --> 02:38:41,280
Oh yeah.
Uptalk is so annoying.

3734
02:38:41,310 --> 02:38:42,143
Tech talk.
Here's a way that they taught that lets 

3735
02:38:44,461 --> 02:38:45,294
you know that they're in,
whether it's like a very left wing 

3736
02:38:50,310 --> 02:38:54,930
technologically savvy way of talking 
upslope tech top date,

3737
02:38:55,140 --> 02:38:56,820
but it's all tech people.
Yeah.

3738
02:38:56,940 --> 02:38:58,710
But it,
it becomes an accent.

3739
02:38:58,711 --> 02:38:59,544
Like if it was from Georgia or something
like that would be a recognizable 

3740
02:39:02,161 --> 02:39:03,040
accent.
Like,

3741
02:39:03,060 --> 02:39:03,990
oh,
that's how they talk.

3742
02:39:03,991 --> 02:39:05,180
And Maryland.
Right.

3743
02:39:05,280 --> 02:39:07,410
Have you ever talked to someone from 
baltimore?

3744
02:39:07,440 --> 02:39:08,490
Baltimore,
baltimore,

3745
02:39:09,510 --> 02:39:10,430
ryan sickler?
Yeah,

3746
02:39:10,490 --> 02:39:12,420
cyclones.
Margaret says baltimore.

3747
02:39:12,520 --> 02:39:13,960
Tuesday,
tuesday,

3748
02:39:13,961 --> 02:39:14,920
tuesday,
tuesday,

3749
02:39:14,950 --> 02:39:15,970
tuesday,
tuesday.

3750
02:39:16,450 --> 02:39:17,470
Yeah.
My friend john rollo.

3751
02:39:17,471 --> 02:39:18,940
Shout out to john raul.
He's from baltimore.

3752
02:39:18,941 --> 02:39:21,790
They have that same kind of.
It's a very boston,

3753
02:39:22,300 --> 02:39:25,190
very recognizable at boston's.
Got that fucking article,

3754
02:39:25,930 --> 02:39:26,763
uptalk recognizable way of talking that 
lets you know that I'm going to agree 

3755
02:39:33,250 --> 02:39:34,083
with everything that is in like the 
zeitgeists of left wing progressive and 

3756
02:39:38,600 --> 02:39:40,240
the cloud.
The cloud.

3757
02:39:40,270 --> 02:39:42,130
It'S in the cloud.
Does that the best?

3758
02:39:42,131 --> 02:39:42,964
Fred armisen I think does that.
The best armisen knows how to like fred 

3759
02:39:45,191 --> 02:39:46,410
armisen.
What is that?

3760
02:39:46,860 --> 02:39:47,920
From portlandia.
Oh,

3761
02:39:47,921 --> 02:39:48,910
okay.
What is she doing?

3762
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:49,833
She's talking about.
I've talked.

3763
02:39:49,930 --> 02:39:50,700
Let me here

3764
02:39:50,700 --> 02:39:51,533
question.
It doesn't bother me that much unless 

3765
02:39:53,751 --> 02:39:56,600
they do it a lot and it gets really 
annoying.

3766
02:39:57,380 --> 02:39:59,260
Talking with connie chung.
Focus

3767
02:39:59,260 --> 02:40:02,500
on the positive things in yourself.
That supermodel cindy crawford.

3768
02:40:02,920 --> 02:40:04,330
She's going to do it again.
Oh,

3769
02:40:04,331 --> 02:40:05,164
I didn't have the opportunities then.
The popular term for it is talking to 

3770
02:40:08,581 --> 02:40:10,870
everyone,
but you don't have to be a fashion model

3771
02:40:10,871 --> 02:40:15,600
or a teenager to uptalk came ikea 
because you can hear it on commercials.

3772
02:40:15,601 --> 02:40:16,434
I mean,
it's kind of self serve or even coming 

3773
02:40:18,091 --> 02:40:18,924
out of the mouth of a doctor on the 
president's healthcare task force 

3774
02:40:21,860 --> 02:40:23,820
because I see the problem from a 
different point of view.

3775
02:40:24,270 --> 02:40:27,120
She came to the table and said,
my name is belinda.

3776
02:40:27,570 --> 02:40:31,660
Dr cynthia macklemore is a linguist in 
philadelphia who's work takes 10

3777
02:40:32,670 --> 02:40:34,560
[inaudible] 94.
That's how fucking old this is.

3778
02:40:34,561 --> 02:40:39,110
This huge thing for her doctorate.
Intonation was way more exaggerated.

3779
02:40:39,111 --> 02:40:39,944
Now.
It's interesting what they were talking 

3780
02:40:41,331 --> 02:40:42,530
about in [inaudible] 94.

3781
02:40:42,670 --> 02:40:45,820
Some of the artists would make 
announcements and take pledges.

3782
02:40:46,390 --> 02:40:49,630
I need your form.
It's not a request for direct response,

3783
02:40:49,631 --> 02:40:52,600
but for attention,
which is the kind of response people may

3784
02:40:52,601 --> 02:40:54,880
think that uptalk conveys the 
uncertainty,

3785
02:40:55,060 --> 02:40:59,360
but dr mcnamara says it can be used in a
number of specific way or do you can.

3786
02:40:59,400 --> 02:41:01,030
You can use the rise to convey 
uncertainty.

3787
02:41:01,031 --> 02:41:04,870
You can use a rise to hold the floor.
You can use a rise to convey,

3788
02:41:04,930 --> 02:41:05,763
do you understand what I'm saying or do 
you hear me or do you agree with me or 

3789
02:41:08,441 --> 02:41:10,270
do you approve of me?
All of those things.

3790
02:41:10,500 --> 02:41:12,120
That's very interesting here.
No language.

3791
02:41:12,130 --> 02:41:14,850
Describe what it is because it has been 
adopted.

3792
02:41:14,970 --> 02:41:18,320
See if you can google tech talk up 
talks.

3793
02:41:18,360 --> 02:41:20,850
What I was looking for.
Let's see if you can find like a because

3794
02:41:20,851 --> 02:41:21,684
it's way more exaggerated now and the 
people that you know who I'm talking 

3795
02:41:25,261 --> 02:41:26,280
about,
the woman that was talking to you on the

3796
02:41:26,281 --> 02:41:27,600
phone,
how crazy was she?

3797
02:41:27,900 --> 02:41:31,950
it was weird the way she was talking.
Just take a presentation too.

3798
02:41:31,951 --> 02:41:32,784
So what kind of.
Are you working on berenger x and is 

3799
02:41:36,840 --> 02:41:37,980
two.
One six.

3800
02:41:38,070 --> 02:41:41,400
Is that it?
I felt like we were in a sketch when she

3801
02:41:41,401 --> 02:41:43,170
was talking to him.
I'm like this is an snl,

3802
02:41:43,171 --> 02:41:46,740
but she had no answers for him and so it
was like she was like bullshitting him.

3803
02:41:47,040 --> 02:41:49,110
Well that's your place.
That's to placate to pass time.

3804
02:41:49,170 --> 02:41:50,003
That's like anybody,
anybody in that tech world that anyone 

3805
02:41:51,690 --> 02:41:52,800
that's helping you with like a.

3806
02:41:52,830 --> 02:41:53,663
Any sort of troubleshooting.
I find that too when I do that with 

3807
02:41:55,891 --> 02:41:57,810
apple,
when I text them about issues,

3808
02:41:58,110 --> 02:41:59,650
everything is like this weird play 
kidding.

3809
02:41:59,651 --> 02:42:01,210
Like,
oh I know.

3810
02:42:01,320 --> 02:42:02,760
I can't believe you're having that 
prOblem.

3811
02:42:02,990 --> 02:42:03,840
Well,
let's just figure it out.

3812
02:42:03,870 --> 02:42:06,420
It's almost like this like patting you 
on the head,

3813
02:42:06,421 --> 02:42:09,750
like subservient.
Like are you okay in your pod?

3814
02:42:09,900 --> 02:42:12,280
Do you need more food in your pod?
Oh,

3815
02:42:12,360 --> 02:42:15,270
so you have an issue with the sonos 
player.

3816
02:42:15,830 --> 02:42:17,840
It's all apple.
All lap,

3817
02:42:17,841 --> 02:42:20,370
all apple.
Apple has a sneaky,

3818
02:42:20,390 --> 02:42:21,223
you know,
the sonos thing works flawlessly with 

3819
02:42:24,331 --> 02:42:28,440
the apple music service.
Loyalty for flawless spotify.

3820
02:42:28,470 --> 02:42:30,750
but when you try to get the shit right 
off your phone,

3821
02:42:30,990 --> 02:42:33,900
that's when it problem.
So they've done some sneaky shit.

3822
02:42:33,901 --> 02:42:35,280
Force you into that.
Yeah.

3823
02:42:35,281 --> 02:42:38,040
That forces you into using their 
subscription service.

3824
02:42:38,070 --> 02:42:40,120
Sure.
So they've hijacked sonos.

3825
02:42:40,300 --> 02:42:41,133
They've,
they've done some shit where they 

3826
02:42:42,240 --> 02:42:45,060
inserted a little fuck.
Do you into the co's,

3827
02:42:45,210 --> 02:42:45,880
apple,
dick,

3828
02:42:45,880 --> 02:42:47,150
a little bit of apple.

3829
02:42:49,620 --> 02:42:51,900
Did they make it work better with their 
home pod speaker?

3830
02:42:51,930 --> 02:42:53,730
Of course.
Probably 100 percent.

3831
02:42:53,760 --> 02:42:54,593
We're.
Come on.

3832
02:42:54,690 --> 02:42:55,523
It's a much better alternative.
What we suggest switch over to home pod 

3833
02:43:00,390 --> 02:43:04,440
and that way we can listen to everything
you say all the time.

3834
02:43:04,470 --> 02:43:06,340
We're listening in.
When you mute us,

3835
02:43:06,460 --> 02:43:07,293
he just released a new one.
They released a pixel three within new 

3836
02:43:11,110 --> 02:43:11,943
speaker dock,
motherfucker of a thing that the new 

3837
02:43:15,371 --> 02:43:16,204
update on spotify has a built in thing.
So you could so you can like ask for a 

3838
02:43:20,621 --> 02:43:25,621
song to be played because it's not 
probably built into apiary or thing.

3839
02:43:26,050 --> 02:43:26,883
Yeah.
But you have to like allow the 

3840
02:43:27,821 --> 02:43:29,650
microphone and beyond.
Of course,

3841
02:43:29,660 --> 02:43:30,493
it's not a big issue.
It's not going to listen to you jerk 

3842
02:43:32,321 --> 02:43:33,360
off.
Did you let,

3843
02:43:33,440 --> 02:43:35,030
do you allow the microphone to me?
Um,

3844
02:43:35,190 --> 02:43:37,270
why is there a piece of tape over the 
camera?

3845
02:43:37,450 --> 02:43:40,390
We'd like to see your car.
I'd like to see you on the webcam on.

3846
02:43:40,391 --> 02:43:41,570
Want to see your car.
Let me see.

3847
02:43:41,700 --> 02:43:42,533
The only the back of your dick.
It's not even the front is the front 

3848
02:43:44,200 --> 02:43:46,030
facing you.
What's the big deal?

3849
02:43:46,031 --> 02:43:47,220
I took the phone under my cost.

3850
02:43:49,390 --> 02:43:51,070
What's the big deal?
If I see your balls?

3851
02:43:51,280 --> 02:43:52,120
Yeah,

3852
02:43:52,121 --> 02:43:56,380
I put the camera right under my sack.
I rest my nut,

3853
02:43:56,381 --> 02:44:00,090
sack the camera.

3854
02:44:00,640 --> 02:44:05,030

I think you see a red screen of my boss,

3855
02:44:07,020 --> 02:44:07,853
like put your balls like him.
You draped your balls like over like a 

3856
02:44:11,891 --> 02:44:16,891
light bulb when they looked through my 
lens.

3857
02:44:17,560 --> 02:44:20,170
Motherfuckers look ahead.

02:44:25,170 --> 02:44:30,170
Big beefy knife stab or something.
