1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:02,910
Her low freak bitches,

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:03,811
you should step back.

3
00:00:03,811 --> 00:00:07,020
And this is a narrative that gets
repeated over and over again in a social

4
00:00:07,021 --> 00:00:08,070
justice warrior culture.

5
00:00:08,071 --> 00:00:12,150
This idea that you should just step back
and let these others talk because they

6
00:00:12,151 --> 00:00:12,950
understand as long.

7
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:13,250
Yeah.

8
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,780
And the others are always
other group members.

9
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:16,440
Right.

10
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,490
And somehow their,

11
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:22,230
their discourses to be privileged in
reverse because hypothetically they're a

12
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:23,730
member of an oppressed class.

13
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,020
Right.

14
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:24,331
Of course.

15
00:00:24,331 --> 00:00:28,380
And you can multiply the numbers
of oppressed classes ad Nauseum,

16
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:29,970
which is another part of the problem.

17
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:30,431
Yeah.

18
00:00:30,431 --> 00:00:33,960
I like the idea is that in giving
them privilege because they have been

19
00:00:33,961 --> 00:00:34,621
marginalized,

20
00:00:34,621 --> 00:00:38,070
you will balance things out and you
will somehow another reverse the scale.

21
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:38,810
Yeah.

22
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:41,490
And that's another example of
the class based guilt idea.

23
00:00:41,491 --> 00:00:41,791
You know,

24
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:43,020
it's um,

25
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:47,700
it doesn't seem to me self evident that
I'm to blame for slavery for example.

26
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:47,971
I mean,

27
00:00:47,971 --> 00:00:48,721
being a Canadian,

28
00:00:48,721 --> 00:00:50,760
it's a slightly different
situation I suppose,

29
00:00:50,761 --> 00:00:52,290
but the,

30
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,720
the idea that as the member,

31
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:55,890
as a member of a culture,

32
00:00:55,891 --> 00:00:58,290
that you're somehow
responsible for the past,

33
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:58,860
uh,

34
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,090
sins of that culture,

35
00:01:00,091 --> 00:01:01,330
let's say it,

36
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:01,950
it,

37
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:02,701
it's a very,

38
00:01:02,701 --> 00:01:04,740
very anti western ethos.

39
00:01:04,741 --> 00:01:04,861
It,

40
00:01:04,861 --> 00:01:08,580
it goes along with this idea of class
guilt because your group membership is the

41
00:01:08,581 --> 00:01:09,480
most important thing.

42
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:10,441
If your group,

43
00:01:10,441 --> 00:01:11,360
at some point in the past,

44
00:01:11,361 --> 00:01:13,080
it's something reprehensible,

45
00:01:13,081 --> 00:01:14,610
which of course every group has done,

46
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,713
that's for sure.

47
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,620
Then you were defacto responsible
in the present for that.

48
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:24,450
How do you think we got to this point
where people are repeating these patterns

49
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:28,380
that were ultimately
incredibly unsuccessful and
dangerous and deadly in the

50
00:01:28,381 --> 00:01:28,921
past?

51
00:01:28,921 --> 00:01:30,390
Like Marxism for example,

52
00:01:30,391 --> 00:01:35,220
like people proudly proclaim
themselves as having Marxist ideology,

53
00:01:35,221 --> 00:01:36,000
one in five,

54
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,330
one in five social scientists claims
to be a Marxist kind of thing.

55
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:40,890
I understand the history.

56
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,830
Why don't you fill people
in on how that went bad?

57
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:44,881
Well,

58
00:01:44,881 --> 00:01:45,900
the estimates vary,

59
00:01:45,901 --> 00:01:49,860
but in the Soviet Union
between 1919 to 1959,

60
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:54,120
somewhere between 30 and 50 million
people were killed in internal oppression

61
00:01:54,121 --> 00:01:54,954
alone.

62
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,950
So that's pretty bad.

63
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:56,750
And then,

64
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:57,010
and,

65
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:58,020
and in China,

66
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:58,790
uh,

67
00:01:58,790 --> 00:01:59,080
which,

68
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,290
which was operating under
exactly the same principles,

69
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:05,070
it might've been up to a hundred
million killed during Mao's time.

70
00:02:05,071 --> 00:02:06,990
And of course my was
still revered in China,

71
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,250
appallingly enough.

72
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:09,570
Um,

73
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:10,530
and Vietnam,

74
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,790
Vietnam and Cambodia.

75
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:13,740
And wherever these ideas were implemented,

76
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,113
Cuba,

77
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,740
wherever these ideas were implemented,

78
00:02:16,741 --> 00:02:16,940
uh,

79
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,870
the result was absolute mayhem,

80
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,920
absolute mayhem.

81
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:23,610
And I think what happened is that
the Marxist ideas are actually quite

82
00:02:23,611 --> 00:02:27,360
attractive if you're an
Intel lectural and if you're,

83
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:31,200
I would say if you're tilted towards
compassion from a personality perspective,

84
00:02:31,201 --> 00:02:33,510
because they're based
on doctrines like from,

85
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,351
from each,

86
00:02:34,351 --> 00:02:38,340
according to his ability to each according
to his need and the idea that you

87
00:02:38,341 --> 00:02:42,570
should fulfill people's needs or that
society should fulfill people's needs is

88
00:02:42,571 --> 00:02:43,740
on the surface of it.

89
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,880
And attractive idea.

90
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:45,481
Of course,

91
00:02:45,481 --> 00:02:48,630
the problem is who gets to define
the needs and who gets to define the

92
00:02:48,631 --> 00:02:49,201
abilities.

93
00:02:49,201 --> 00:02:53,370
And that really is a big problem and well,

94
00:02:53,371 --> 00:02:55,980
and then those ideas
were put into practice,

95
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,820
uh,

96
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:00,130
first in the Soviet Union and Alexander
Solzhenitsyn who wrote the Gulag

97
00:03:00,131 --> 00:03:04,910
archipelago did a very
lovely job of detailing in,

98
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:08,710
in horrifying detail how those initial
doctrines were transformed into

99
00:03:08,711 --> 00:03:13,711
legislation and then how those legislation
was transformed into endless genocide

100
00:03:13,721 --> 00:03:15,760
essentially and almost
destroyed the world.

101
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,080
Let's not forget that,

102
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:17,950
um,

103
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:21,640
partly with w partly with the
help of Castro who just died.

104
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,013
Um,

105
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:23,760
the,

106
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,790
the doctrines when,

107
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,410
when put into practice in,

108
00:03:26,411 --> 00:03:27,010
into,

109
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,390
into actual practice,

110
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,610
we're were murderous instantaneously now.

111
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:31,683
But what happened?

112
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:34,690
They're always apologists
for the left in the West,

113
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,130
especially in France,

114
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,750
especially among the French intellectuals,

115
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:41,690
especially in the late
1960s and then when,

116
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:44,150
when all of the information
about what was happening in,

117
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,930
in the Soviet Union came flooding forward
and that culminated say in 19 boat,

118
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,050
1973 it wouldn't,

119
00:03:50,051 --> 00:03:51,430
Solzhenitsyn's book was published.

120
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,660
The French intellectuals changed their
tune instead of agitating on a part of

121
00:03:55,661 --> 00:03:56,381
the working class,

122
00:03:56,381 --> 00:03:57,214
which was,

123
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:01,670
which allied them with a murderous marks
is to stay switched and started to talk

124
00:04:01,671 --> 00:04:02,321
about power.

125
00:04:02,321 --> 00:04:04,750
And to talk about group identity,

126
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,070
it was like a sleight of hand.

127
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:09,610
The underlying pathological
philosophy remained exactly the same,

128
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:14,260
but the surface nomenclature changed
and that became very attractive.

129
00:04:14,261 --> 00:04:16,570
And at the same time the
Soviet Union dissolved.

130
00:04:16,571 --> 00:04:21,040
And so one of the problems I think we
have now a perverse problem is that these

131
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:24,610
Marxist ideas are very attractive
to compassionate intellectuals.

132
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:25,840
And we don't have good,

133
00:04:25,841 --> 00:04:29,380
bad examples like the Soviet Union around
that everybody can point to and go,

134
00:04:29,381 --> 00:04:29,621
yeah,

135
00:04:29,621 --> 00:04:29,861
yeah,

136
00:04:29,861 --> 00:04:30,700
well that sounds good.

137
00:04:30,701 --> 00:04:31,534
But you know,

138
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,840
what about the murderous death camps
in the millions of people who are

139
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:35,430
suffering,

140
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,610
we still have North Korea,

141
00:04:36,611 --> 00:04:37,061
but you know,

142
00:04:37,061 --> 00:04:40,840
people treat North Korea like it's a joke
instead of like it's an exemplar of a

143
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:45,730
pathological system and people have
no historical memory like my students.

144
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:49,750
And that's partly because they're taught
so badly in schools is they have no

145
00:04:49,751 --> 00:04:51,430
idea what happened in the Soviet Union.

146
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:52,960
They have absolutely no idea.

147
00:04:52,961 --> 00:04:55,240
They know a little bit about
the Second World War maybe.

148
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,750
And of course people generally
know about the Holocaust,

149
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:01,720
but they have no idea what
happened in the Soviet Union.

150
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,850
So they have no idea where
these ideas could lead.

151
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:08,530
And this and the universities and the
high schools are so full of people who are

152
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:11,590
radically left leaning that
they're never taught any,

153
00:05:11,591 --> 00:05:13,540
that students are never
taught any proper history.

154
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:13,751
You know,

155
00:05:13,751 --> 00:05:15,610
they're taught about
the evils of capitalism.

156
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,560
And you know,

157
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:17,981
I mean,

158
00:05:17,981 --> 00:05:18,790
it's not like,

159
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:21,670
it's not like any system is perfect,

160
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,580
but there's difference
between imperfect and,

161
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:26,740
and consciously murderous.

162
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:31,060
I think one of the things he use just
said that's very important is that it's

163
00:05:31,061 --> 00:05:33,820
attractive to compassionate intellectuals.

164
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:38,970
People that without really looking
at what the potential for these,

165
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:39,560
the,

166
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,560
these laws and regulations with a
negative potential for them is the,

167
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:45,700
the,

168
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:50,700
the underlying inclination to
lean towards that is that you,

169
00:05:51,761 --> 00:05:52,120
you,

170
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,670
you care about people and then you,

171
00:05:53,671 --> 00:05:55,960
you want people to be okay.

172
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,281
And you know,

173
00:05:56,281 --> 00:05:58,280
when you're kind of treating
them like they're your children.

174
00:05:58,281 --> 00:05:58,820
Yes.

175
00:05:58,820 --> 00:05:59,151
And,

176
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:02,900
and I don't mean that in an
entirely sarcastic manner.

177
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,263
Um,

178
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:08,660
it's reasonable in some sense to treat
other people like people that you love,

179
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:11,330
although it's not reasonable
and in very many other ways,

180
00:06:11,331 --> 00:06:14,120
which is why you don't
invite every stranger on the
street to come and live with

181
00:06:14,121 --> 00:06:14,954
you in your house.

182
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:15,561
I mean,

183
00:06:15,561 --> 00:06:18,020
everybody puts up boundaries
and you have to do that,

184
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,393
but,

185
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,770
and people tend more than,

186
00:06:21,771 --> 00:06:23,240
than we ever expected.

187
00:06:23,241 --> 00:06:25,640
And I've done a lot of
research and this in my lab,

188
00:06:25,641 --> 00:06:29,900
but people do tend to vote and think
their temperament a lot more than,

189
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,490
than anyone really realizes.

190
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:32,400
And,

191
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,210
and if you're kind and
that's your highest virtue,

192
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,470
then you tend to treat people like they're
kin because that's what kind means,

193
00:06:39,471 --> 00:06:39,711
right?

194
00:06:39,711 --> 00:06:39,920
It's,

195
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,570
it's an extension of the word kin.

196
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,940
But that doesn't work
well in larger groups.

197
00:06:43,941 --> 00:06:45,110
You need other principals.

198
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:47,430
And so you look at
something like the idea of,

199
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:48,171
of equity,

200
00:06:48,171 --> 00:06:51,650
which is equality of outcome rather
than equality of opportunity.

201
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:52,760
On the surface of it,

202
00:06:52,761 --> 00:06:54,170
it seems perfectly reasonable to say,

203
00:06:54,171 --> 00:06:54,830
well,

204
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:59,150
if every resource isn't distributed
absolutely equally to every group,

205
00:06:59,151 --> 00:07:00,740
then the system is unfair.

206
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:02,450
And on the face of it,

207
00:07:02,451 --> 00:07:04,160
that's a reasonable proposition,

208
00:07:04,161 --> 00:07:06,800
but it falls apart under
minimal examination.

209
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,780
So here's something to think about for,

210
00:07:08,781 --> 00:07:09,230
for all,

211
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:12,230
for everyone who thinks that
equality of outcome is a good idea,

212
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:12,920
it's like,

213
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,350
why the hell are you
striving for anything then?

214
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:21,070
Because the reason anyone's strives to
better themselves or to develop a skill

215
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:26,030
or to move forward in life at
all is to produce inequality.

216
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:31,690
You're trying to rise above the mediocre
masses every time you make an effort at

217
00:07:32,001 --> 00:07:32,834
anything.

218
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:35,270
And so everything that we associate,

219
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,223
um,

220
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:41,350
positive movement forward to a positive
motivation is actually an attempt to

221
00:07:41,391 --> 00:07:43,220
render the world more unequal.

222
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:44,600
Now you're rendering and,

223
00:07:44,601 --> 00:07:46,460
and we equal in adjust way,

224
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:47,421
right?

225
00:07:47,421 --> 00:07:48,260
Because we might say,

226
00:07:48,261 --> 00:07:48,441
well,

227
00:07:48,441 --> 00:07:49,400
if you work really hard,

228
00:07:49,401 --> 00:07:51,080
you deserve an unequal outcome.

229
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:51,620
Well,

230
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,160
yeah,

231
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,620
unless you want people
to stop working hard.

232
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,870
And that was the old
joke in the Soviet Union.

233
00:07:56,871 --> 00:07:57,704
You know,

234
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,330
they pretend to pay us,

235
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,310
we pretend to work.

236
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:04,980
So it's so,

237
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:05,240
it's,

238
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:05,570
it's,

239
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:07,550
it's so thoughtless that that's,

240
00:08:07,551 --> 00:08:08,450
that's the problem.

241
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:08,681
Well.

242
00:08:08,681 --> 00:08:12,500
And it's also extremely annoying for
people who've worked really hard and and

243
00:08:12,501 --> 00:08:16,760
who've made the requisite sacrifices to
become successful along some dimension,

244
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,790
to have that immediately
attributed to their oppression.

245
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:20,870
And it's not,

246
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,940
it's not obvious that that's
something we want to do.

247
00:08:22,941 --> 00:08:27,710
It's like for the social justice warrior
types out there who might be listening,

248
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:28,221
it's like,

249
00:08:28,221 --> 00:08:28,551
do you,

250
00:08:28,551 --> 00:08:32,270
are you really willing to say that
every single person who's accomplished

251
00:08:32,271 --> 00:08:35,090
something as done that as a
consequence of oppression,

252
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:37,850
that that's again with the Soviets
claimed with regards to the,

253
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:42,860
to the successful peasants in the 19
in the just before the 1920s it's like,

254
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,350
well the peasants were
in demand dissipated.

255
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:48,620
They were serfs until about 30
years before that they were served.

256
00:08:48,621 --> 00:08:52,670
They were basically slaves and some of
them had clambered up to the point where

257
00:08:52,671 --> 00:08:56,760
maybe they own their hot and a cow
could you don't employ somewhat.

258
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,350
While the Soviet claim was,

259
00:08:58,351 --> 00:08:59,610
well that's all theft.

260
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:01,530
You've got that all cause
you're an oppressor.

261
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:05,640
And so then the Soviet intellectuals went
into the villages and just imagine how

262
00:09:05,641 --> 00:09:06,161
this happened.

263
00:09:06,161 --> 00:09:07,290
So imagine a village,

264
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:11,940
a small town where everyone
knows everybody and there's
maybe 10 20 people there

265
00:09:11,941 --> 00:09:13,440
who were moderately successful.

266
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,071
Okay.

267
00:09:14,071 --> 00:09:18,150
And so you can imagine that those 20
people have like a hundred enemies at the

268
00:09:18,151 --> 00:09:20,340
bottom of the socioeconomic distribution,

269
00:09:20,341 --> 00:09:20,970
useless,

270
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:24,810
horrible people who are jealous and
resentful about the fact that these people

271
00:09:24,811 --> 00:09:25,710
have been successful.

272
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:26,191
Okay?

273
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:29,250
So now the intellectuals come
in and say property is theft,

274
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,750
success is oppression.

275
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:34,380
And then they looked for the people
in the village who are willing to move

276
00:09:34,381 --> 00:09:36,480
against those 20 successful people.

277
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:36,961
Well,

278
00:09:36,961 --> 00:09:38,160
those guys at the bottom,

279
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:39,810
those hundred resentful,

280
00:09:39,811 --> 00:09:40,590
jealous,

281
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:42,270
murderous people at the bottom,

282
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,420
they're just waiting for an
opportunity to go kick down some doors.

283
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:48,180
And that's exactly what they
did in the 1920s and as I said,

284
00:09:48,181 --> 00:09:51,910
they wiped out all their
productive peasants and then
6 million Ukrainian starve

285
00:09:51,911 --> 00:09:53,790
to death if they had posters.

286
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,640
The Soviets produced posters
in the 1930s that said,

287
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,163
essentially,

288
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:58,591
um,

289
00:09:58,591 --> 00:09:59,430
don't forget,

290
00:09:59,431 --> 00:10:01,230
it's wrong to eat your children.

291
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,320
So whoa.

292
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:05,741
Yeah,

293
00:10:05,741 --> 00:10:06,574
whoa.

294
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:09,710
There's nothing about the Soviet,

295
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:14,800
there's nothing that you can imagine
that's horrible enough so that it matched

296
00:10:14,801 --> 00:10:19,801
the reality of what happened in the
Soviet Union between 1919 to 1959 and you

297
00:10:20,081 --> 00:10:20,261
know,

298
00:10:20,261 --> 00:10:22,360
the West knew about this too early.

299
00:10:22,361 --> 00:10:24,940
Malcolm Muggeridge in the
30s was documenting for,

300
00:10:24,941 --> 00:10:25,541
for England,

301
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:25,890
for,

302
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:26,860
for English newspapers.

303
00:10:26,861 --> 00:10:28,660
Exactly what was going
on in the Soviet Union.

304
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:31,900
Bloody intellectuals didn't admit
it until the mid seventies you know,

305
00:10:31,901 --> 00:10:34,390
with the exception of
people like George Orwell

306
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,730
[inaudible].
