1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:03,540
Henry rollins was on the podcast before
three,

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:04,950
two,
one.

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:10,470
You have very specific style of wearing
the headphones with like one to the side

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,050
and Henry rollins does the same thing
and I said,

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,910
Oh,
you're wearing your headphones.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,800
Headphones.
Jim Norton style.

7
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,620
I didn't know that you guys had had some
sort of an altercation.

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,060
Well how would you this recently,
like a couple months ago,

9
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:25,920
two months ago,
he didn't say anything.

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,740
Someone else told me online.
Oh,

11
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,010
I thought it had.
They're still mad about it.

12
00:00:29,011 --> 00:00:29,400
I'm like,
no.

13
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,670
It was minor.
It was it a minor cold fucking online

14
00:00:32,671 --> 00:00:34,290
people.
They blow everything out of proportion.

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,640
We've talked since then.
I like him a lot.

16
00:00:35,641 --> 00:00:36,750
We've interviewed him.
I think he's great.

17
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,640
It's interesting guy.
Very interesting.

18
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,210
We were talking comedy one time and I
forget what he was talking about with

19
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,970
Richard Pryor on the phone,
but he was a little like,

20
00:00:44,971 --> 00:00:45,804
oh,
you don't remember.

21
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:47,580
Oh,
that's right.

22
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:49,680
I remember this.
I vaguely remember it.

23
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,360
Yeah,
he was trying to pretend that you didn't

24
00:00:51,361 --> 00:00:54,570
know Richard Pryor and you're like maybe
one of the biggest Richard Pryor fans of

25
00:00:54,571 --> 00:00:55,530
all time.
Yeah,

26
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:57,680
I love him and it was a silly thing to
try to,

27
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,570
like for what?
Like there's no valor in knowing Richard

28
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,190
Pryor on fire,
on purpose.

29
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:06,240
There's a weird thing that people do
when they pretend that knowing things

30
00:01:06,241 --> 00:01:08,550
makes them better than you because you
don't know things.

31
00:01:08,551 --> 00:01:10,260
Yeah.
It's very strange.

32
00:01:10,261 --> 00:01:11,880
Like knowing something is just like,
oh,

33
00:01:11,881 --> 00:01:14,100
you know about it,
it's all it is.

34
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,660
And we also get caught up in where Colin
has a brilliant joke about how people,

35
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,280
if you learn something from a movie,
people are embarrassed to go.

36
00:01:20,281 --> 00:01:21,960
I learned that from TV or I learned it
from a movie.

37
00:01:21,961 --> 00:01:24,760
So they try to act like they read it and
he's smarter because you're reading

38
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:25,893
hated him.

39
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,190
You for that great point.
But you do people feel smarter if they

40
00:01:29,191 --> 00:01:30,270
read something.
Yeah,

41
00:01:30,271 --> 00:01:31,560
that's true.
That's true.

42
00:01:31,561 --> 00:01:34,230
My daughter was just telling me that
today that she,

43
00:01:34,231 --> 00:01:36,750
uh,
she learned something from an animated

44
00:01:36,751 --> 00:01:39,180
movie and uh,
and she said fest,

45
00:01:39,181 --> 00:01:41,460
the weirdest way to learn things ever.
And I'm like,

46
00:01:41,461 --> 00:01:42,600
well,
it's really not.

47
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:43,710
I go,
it's just,

48
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,270
it's just a thing,
you know,

49
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,400
it's like you can learn things from
anything.

50
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:49,250
It won't be any different learning from
there.

51
00:01:49,251 --> 00:01:52,170
And then if you hear somebody say it,
but there's just ways that we think are

52
00:01:52,171 --> 00:01:54,240
smart.
Like I just so much smarter if I read

53
00:01:54,241 --> 00:01:57,450
something and,
and just hearing it on the TV,

54
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:59,370
I like,
I'm a fucking dope repeating what I

55
00:01:59,371 --> 00:02:02,130
heard again.
Well I have a friend who will get upset

56
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,040
if people say they read a book,
if they actually listened to the audio

57
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:05,760
book.

58
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,593
Really?
Yeah.

59
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,640
It was like,
well did you read it or did you listen

60
00:02:08,641 --> 00:02:09,570
to the audio book?
I'm like,

61
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:13,020
fuck man.
Like leave the guy alone.

62
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,060
I think listening to it's better.
Well,

63
00:02:15,061 --> 00:02:17,490
it's a,
it's way more productive.

64
00:02:17,491 --> 00:02:21,300
Like you can get it done while you're
doing stuff like driving your car at the

65
00:02:21,301 --> 00:02:24,450
gym or whatever.
Can you see my focus has gotten so

66
00:02:24,451 --> 00:02:26,440
fucked up,
like can you sit down and actually just.

67
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:28,570
I read a book and then all of a sudden
I'm like,

68
00:02:28,571 --> 00:02:31,630
I doing totally addictive.
I can't fucking read a book anymore that

69
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:34,080
I can get.
My focus is not there.

70
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,840
I read at night before I go to bed.
That's what I like to do.

71
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,750
I like to read and when,
when I start like having a hard time

72
00:02:39,751 --> 00:02:41,460
paying attention,
that's when it's time to crash.

73
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,380
How long can you read for like a couple
hours.

74
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,450
Oh yeah,
I'm good for a couple hours.

75
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,550
I'm usually good for no more than say
like,

76
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,450
well if I sat down during the day I
could read for about three hours,

77
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,180
but at night,
at night I'm good for about two.

78
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,940
You have that kind of focus?
It depends on what I'm reading.

79
00:02:56,941 --> 00:02:59,910
If it's really interesting you,
I'm to do it.

80
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,450
Well,
I'm reading now.

81
00:03:01,451 --> 00:03:05,830
It's kind of research.
It's about a book called American

82
00:03:05,831 --> 00:03:07,750
Serengeti.
It's about,

83
00:03:07,751 --> 00:03:08,830
uh,
what the,

84
00:03:08,831 --> 00:03:12,460
uh,
wildlife used to be on the American

85
00:03:12,461 --> 00:03:15,100
planes like before in the Pleistocene
era,

86
00:03:15,101 --> 00:03:15,890
I guess.
Uh,

87
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:17,020
you know,
before the Ice Age,

88
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,920
it's pretty crazy shit.
I understood none of those words except

89
00:03:20,921 --> 00:03:23,770
for like the American you said,
the first part I got and the rest of it

90
00:03:23,771 --> 00:03:24,604
I've never heard of.
Well,

91
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,200
there's this guy that I'm having on the
potty.

92
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,810
He was supposed to be here last month.
We had rescheduled to next month,

93
00:03:28,811 --> 00:03:33,811
but he's a wildlife historian or a
biological is and I guess it would be.

94
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,400
I'm not sure which one he would be,
but his name is Dan Flores,

95
00:03:36,401 --> 00:03:38,380
and he wrote this amazing book about
coyotes,

96
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:41,590
but the history of the coyote,
and he wrote another book about the

97
00:03:41,591 --> 00:03:46,591
history of extinct wildlife in the
American southwest or the American West,

98
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:51,460
and at one point in time we had all
sorts of crazy shit.

99
00:03:51,461 --> 00:03:53,500
We had cheetahs.
There was cheetahs,

100
00:03:53,501 --> 00:03:55,810
there was lions that were bigger than
African lions.

101
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,210
There was a thing called a short face
bear,

102
00:03:58,211 --> 00:04:00,790
which is fucking enormous bear.
Bigger than a polar bear.

103
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,210
We had.
There's a reason why like,

104
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,750
have you ever seen an antelope like
American antelope,

105
00:04:04,751 --> 00:04:07,120
like a pronghorn antelope.
You know what those are?

106
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,500
I've seen antelope,
but that's the only system.

107
00:04:09,501 --> 00:04:13,720
I said that's an antelope line.
While they're this weird animal that

108
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:17,920
lives in Colorado and Wyoming and New
Mexico and a lot of different places,

109
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:21,670
it's a strange animal because it runs
way faster than anything.

110
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:24,340
They can kill it.
That's it right there and the reason

111
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,400
being is because this animal evolved way
way back hundreds of thousands of years

112
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,120
ago when there were cheated here and
they were really fast things that would

113
00:04:34,121 --> 00:04:36,550
chase it.
Like those fucking things are lightning

114
00:04:36,551 --> 00:04:37,630
fast.
Can out run a cheetah.

115
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:41,220
Well they can do their best they can to
get you to work.

116
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:45,310
Yeah,
but whereas like a deer has no shot like

117
00:04:45,311 --> 00:04:48,040
a white tail deer is.
If a child is going after white tail

118
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:49,540
deer,
cheetahs going to get it.

119
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,420
Did you see the video and have a.
I'm such a fruit.

120
00:04:52,421 --> 00:04:55,300
Like I go online.
I like to watch happy animal videos like

121
00:04:55,301 --> 00:04:58,480
baby elephants cuddling.
I went on a fucking baby elephant,

122
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:01,540
like youtube loop,
just watching people cuddling with baby

123
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:02,770
elephants.
They're awesome.

124
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:03,940
I hold a pencil.
Amazing.

125
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,620
They're really fucking smart man.

126
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,080
They're really,
really just really smart.

127
00:05:08,081 --> 00:05:12,040
But they can remember individual
elephants from like decades ago,

128
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:15,670
like they can be separated from their
family and not see their family for 20

129
00:05:15,671 --> 00:05:18,190
years and then they reintroduce him and
when you see the two of them to get

130
00:05:18,191 --> 00:05:20,940
together again,
it's fucking heartbreaking because you

131
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:24,280
like what makes you think about like the
elephants that are in zoos and the

132
00:05:24,281 --> 00:05:25,690
officers who were in the circus you
don't like.

133
00:05:25,691 --> 00:05:27,430
Whoa.
Like what are these things like?

134
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,050
They're not,
they're not,

135
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:31,900
they're not stupid.
There's something wrong.

136
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:34,450
Yeah.
There's some animals that are like dear

137
00:05:34,451 --> 00:05:37,360
beautiful and everything like that.
But they have a very limited cognitive

138
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,320
cognitive function.
Their brain doesn't work that good.

139
00:05:41,321 --> 00:05:43,540
It's just real simple because anything
you want to eat me?

140
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:44,410
No.
Where's the grass?

141
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:45,790
Let me get the grass.
Anything looking at me?

142
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:47,620
No.
Whereas the grant one of two thoughts

143
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,500
and then the time to fuck once a year,
it's time to fuck.

144
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:53,620
Which is crazy.
Which is why they have antlers to fight

145
00:05:53,621 --> 00:05:56,530
off all the other men and fuck.
And then the antlers fall off and then

146
00:05:56,531 --> 00:05:57,830
they're back to normal shit.
But

147
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,440
people think we're unique getting like
Porsche's and Lamborghini.

148
00:06:00,441 --> 00:06:02,510
It's the same thing.
Let's just fucking nicer antlers.

149
00:06:02,511 --> 00:06:03,950
Yeah.
Well they have weapons.

150
00:06:03,951 --> 00:06:05,660
Really.
They fight each other to death.

151
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,200
They kill each other all the time.
They do.

152
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,130
Yeah.
That's fucked.

153
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:11,480
That's what those things are for those
giant antlers differ stabbing.

154
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:14,000
They just slam into each other.
They had buddy each other and they

155
00:06:14,001 --> 00:06:16,940
occasionally catch one,
slip it and they broadside and go right

156
00:06:16,941 --> 00:06:19,720
to the fucking lungs.
But a lot of times they'll just kinda

157
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:20,660
back off like,
all right,

158
00:06:20,661 --> 00:06:23,350
he's got bigger antlers and he smashed
me a little bit and I'll,

159
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:25,730
I'll fucking.
It's fun to watch one atom of male

160
00:06:25,731 --> 00:06:28,460
animal baclofen another.
It's so much like human beings.

161
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:31,370
A lot of times it's just posturing.
I'm just going to show you.

162
00:06:31,371 --> 00:06:32,570
That could rip your head off.
All right.

163
00:06:32,571 --> 00:06:33,910
You'll beat it like hippos.

164
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:35,930
Bite each other a little bit.
And then one's like,

165
00:06:35,931 --> 00:06:37,220
all right,
fuck it leaves.

166
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:40,250
I was elk hunting once I saw these two l
duke it out.

167
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:43,630
These two huge animals.
There were about a thousand pounds in

168
00:06:43,631 --> 00:06:45,260
there,
slamming heads into each other,

169
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:49,820
which is running towards these other
bang and headbutting and smashing

170
00:06:49,821 --> 00:06:53,930
antlers together and they were so big.
I mean these are like enormous elk.

171
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,020
Both of them were around somewhere
around a thousand pounds and just the

172
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,430
force that they generate with their
heads colliding with these antlers.

173
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:02,870
All of it.
Just for Pussy.

174
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:03,740
Yeah.
Yeah,

175
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,240
exactly.
That's why I don't think people are so

176
00:07:05,241 --> 00:07:08,900
bad to do what we do because it really
is an animal that were chimps and we're

177
00:07:08,901 --> 00:07:11,450
one step beyond and we just don't do it
that way anymore,

178
00:07:11,451 --> 00:07:14,510
but it's always us fighting to fucking
to mate.

179
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:15,710
Yeah.
We get laid.

180
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:17,480
We do with gold lamborghinis.

181
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:20,540
Fucking beautiful watches and shit.
Yeah.

182
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:22,400
Or even shows a strength is guys that do
it,

183
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,980
you know,
just brutal guys were big and can fuck

184
00:07:24,981 --> 00:07:26,360
you up.
And they get hot girls.

185
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,520
Sure.
And then just people at the gym just

186
00:07:28,521 --> 00:07:29,920
wearing little clothes.
Flexing.

187
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,880
Yeah,
picking up weights.

188
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,770
It's humiliating.
It's weird.

189
00:07:33,771 --> 00:07:38,771
It's like we have a weird sort of a
connection to these ancient animals that

190
00:07:39,681 --> 00:07:43,040
needed to do that in order to make sure
that the women were attracted to the

191
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:45,390
strong genes to stay alive.
It's not,

192
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,250
not nearly as important anymore.
It's weird in the gym too,

193
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,180
because I dressed like shit.
Like I obviously,

194
00:07:50,181 --> 00:07:52,370
I mean I can't wear a tank top and would
look silly,

195
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,610
so I wear like sweatpants and like an
old rotten hoodie.

196
00:07:55,611 --> 00:07:58,760
I really look like a bum in the gym can.
I know that I can't compete,

197
00:07:58,761 --> 00:08:00,530
so I'm almost going totally the opposite
way.

198
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:03,260
Like people wonder like what kind of
shape I might be in.

199
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,350
I know I can't compete on a level of
looking good in a gym.

200
00:08:06,351 --> 00:08:07,760
Like I'm never going to get laid in a
gym.

201
00:08:07,761 --> 00:08:09,710
We'll never know.
Never picked up a girl in the gym.

202
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,260
Well,
I dated a person who trained me.

203
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,970
I didn't want to,
but she knew me.

204
00:08:13,971 --> 00:08:17,560
It was a personality thing.
It was never like a.

205
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,010
It was never like,
wow,

206
00:08:19,011 --> 00:08:20,710
this guy is cute.
I'm going to fuck him.

207
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,490
Like it's never worked that way.
Damn.

208
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:23,383
No,
never,

209
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,161
never.
I,

210
00:08:24,161 --> 00:08:24,550
I,
I,

211
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:27,380
I just kinda wanted it.
I'd become friends with them and then

212
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:29,180
all of a sudden we're fucking like a
year later and like,

213
00:08:29,181 --> 00:08:30,014
well,
how'd that happen?

214
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,560
Just sneak your way in.
I really do.

215
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:36,590
I just put personality my way into it.
Uh,

216
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,740
and the one girl who I,
I really,

217
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,010
she's still a really good friend of
mine.

218
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:43,610
We dated for maybe two months and I
think she's in a different place in life

219
00:08:43,611 --> 00:08:46,610
and kind of wanted kids and I'm a
fucking Perv I,

220
00:08:46,611 --> 00:08:49,370
I just can't do it.
And I know that,

221
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:53,770
but I was so attracted to her.
I was so few.

222
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:57,060
I wrote a bit about her and one of my in
back and please be offended.

223
00:08:57,061 --> 00:09:01,290
I did a bit about following a girl up
the steps and looking at her badge in

224
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,150
the back of her pants because it was so
nice.

225
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,730
And uh,
tell it was about her.

226
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:08,640
I did,
I told her after we had dated and she

227
00:09:08,641 --> 00:09:09,850
loved it.
She thought it was really fun and he

228
00:09:09,851 --> 00:09:10,441
said,
Oh my God,

229
00:09:10,441 --> 00:09:12,240
that's the greatest.
She was really a fun person.

230
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:13,291
But uh,
yeah,

231
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:15,960
I lost it her for so long and then we
wound up dating,

232
00:09:15,961 --> 00:09:17,880
but I knew her for like a year before we
dated.

233
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:21,510
When you lust for someone for that long,
finally when you finally get there,

234
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:26,690
it's such a nerve wracking experience.
Like trying to hold back the Jews.

235
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,320
Ooh.
Ooh,

236
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:30,690
Ooh.
Well you can't believe it's happening

237
00:09:30,691 --> 00:09:31,900
to.
Yeah,

238
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,260
right.
Like finally I like to come fast though.

239
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:38,650
I do because sometimes I'll lose my rod
so if I come fast I won.

240
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,040
Then I can compliment them.
See because of the experience.

241
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:42,870
Like if you lose your heart on your like
ah,

242
00:09:42,871 --> 00:09:43,940
sorry,
this state or whatever,

243
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:44,803
Shit,
I'm fucked up.

244
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,070
But if you come quick it's like wow,
you did great.

245
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,610
I'm a mess.
It's hard for me to let someone else

246
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,370
make me feel good.
Like it's really hard to just let

247
00:09:53,371 --> 00:09:56,160
someone pleasure me.
I can't do it.

248
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:57,270
Really?
Yeah.

249
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,890
I admire people who can like I just,
I'm so solo with that stuff.

250
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,960
Wow.
Very different role.

251
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:09,170
What do you think that's from?
Just compulsion and jacking off and just

252
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,060
being just jacking off so much know
like,

253
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:11,980
let me hit care of that.
Yeah,

254
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:12,873
yeah,
yeah.

255
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,480
Don't bother with that.
Exactly.

256
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:15,570
I'll throw it,
I'll throw it out that way.

257
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,590
You know,
like when someone's trying to help you

258
00:10:16,591 --> 00:10:17,221
fix something,
you know,

259
00:10:17,221 --> 00:10:18,810
like I got it.
It's Kinda like that.

260
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,610
But with her it was fun.
We just,

261
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,170
we didn't date long too long.
I just,

262
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,180
you know,
I don't like to waste people's time and

263
00:10:24,181 --> 00:10:29,130
I know that I'm not in baby having mode
maybe soon.

264
00:10:29,131 --> 00:10:30,690
You know,
I wouldn't mind if I like something,

265
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,930
but I think so I kind of want a
relationship.

266
00:10:33,931 --> 00:10:35,580
I've been saying that for like the last
few months,

267
00:10:35,581 --> 00:10:39,210
10 years I've been saying that since I
was middling

268
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,910
I,
I want somebody now like because it's

269
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,840
boring by myself.
Thought about sex,

270
00:10:45,841 --> 00:10:46,290
getting laid.

271
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:49,530
Is it fairly easy if you have money or
you have some kind of personality you

272
00:10:49,531 --> 00:10:52,230
can get laid.
So you kind of want someone like to get

273
00:10:52,231 --> 00:10:56,060
on a plane with or to watch TV with.
That's the shit you missed.

274
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:59,790
Somebody whose opinion you like someone
to hang out with?

275
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:00,643
Yeah.
A friend.

276
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,280
Yeah.
That's where it gets weird.

277
00:11:02,281 --> 00:11:04,740
Right.
But you want sexual too though.

278
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:09,480
My openers were typically women and I
hang out with them and I've never fucked

279
00:11:09,481 --> 00:11:11,400
any of them.
It's never even been an option.

280
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,371
Like,
you know,

281
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:15,720
Kelsey Cook was my lead and she was just
a friend and we would watch tv like an

282
00:11:15,721 --> 00:11:17,780
old,
like an old couple but just.

283
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:20,820
But a nonphysical.
It's just took an old.

284
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:24,470
I'm like an old queen with my fucking
lady friend and I.

285
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:26,160
So I want that like a friend that I hang
out with,

286
00:11:26,161 --> 00:11:28,170
but someone who I'm also,
you know,

287
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,320
I don't want to date a comedian,
I don't think because it's just,

288
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:32,520
you know.

289
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,210
Yeah.
I,

290
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:36,630
I would say that too.
I would say it's just the odds of it

291
00:11:36,631 --> 00:11:40,500
working are so small.
I mean it could work like Tom Seger and

292
00:11:40,501 --> 00:11:41,700
Christina possessed schemes.
Right.

293
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:45,840
It works and they're both really funny.
Usually one of them is not funny.

294
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,650
It's like usually the woman's funding,
the guy sucks or the opposite and then

295
00:11:49,651 --> 00:11:52,980
they sort of glom off each other.
So when one gets resentful of the other

296
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,400
career goal,
yeah,

297
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,040
that's,
that's the case.

298
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:59,830
Often that's the case.
Often there's always like one

299
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,500
breakthrough,
one has something going on and the other

300
00:12:02,501 --> 00:12:03,710
one gets bitter,
right?

301
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:07,720
And they feel bad getting better and
then the other one who presents them

302
00:12:07,721 --> 00:12:09,070
like we're supposed to be partners.
That's a.

303
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:11,280
that's a hard.
Yeah,

304
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,600
that fuck that.
I couldn't do it.

305
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:17,050
The only way I could do it is if it was
just like.

306
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:19,030
I guess it would have to be one of those
things like you were talking about with

307
00:12:19,031 --> 00:12:21,850
your friend where you were friends with
them for a long time,

308
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:25,390
but you're friends with her for a year
and then you were both looking for

309
00:12:25,391 --> 00:12:26,021
somebody.
You're like,

310
00:12:26,021 --> 00:12:26,611
Hey,
you know what?

311
00:12:26,611 --> 00:12:28,420
I'm fucking this.
This actually kind of works.

312
00:12:28,421 --> 00:12:30,430
We know each other really well.
Like once.

313
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,740
See that's the one of the things about
getting intimate with someone.

314
00:12:32,741 --> 00:12:34,300
Sometimes people get intimate with
people.

315
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:37,330
You barely know them and sometimes it
works out great,

316
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,140
but sometimes you're just opening up a
fucking bag of worms.

317
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,660
Oh yeah.
Then you realize,

318
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,810
oh,
you're crazy and you want to blame me

319
00:12:46,811 --> 00:12:49,620
for your entire fucked up life.
You know what I realized?

320
00:12:49,621 --> 00:12:52,330
They're crazy when they're fucking
sitting in my house with a suitcase

321
00:12:52,331 --> 00:12:55,270
because I've flown them in.
Maybe I should get to know them first.

322
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:59,170
I've put a lot of people on planes
before and luggage and I'm like,

323
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,330
no,
fuck them.

324
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,990
But it's like I probably shouldn't know
that they're not unstable first.

325
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,630
Crazy.
Completely crazy.

326
00:13:07,631 --> 00:13:10,900
And then you're in your house and you're
sleeping and they're hovering over you.

327
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,790
Frightened.
Go thinking about putting that pillow

328
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:15,090
over your face.
I've had a couple of you down.

329
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:17,470
I've had a couple where I just,
I literally,

330
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,600
I'm not kidding.
I couldn't sleep because it was just

331
00:13:19,601 --> 00:13:21,760
like I could.
I didn't know the person well enough and

332
00:13:21,761 --> 00:13:24,190
like I didn't want to have sex because
that just takes it to another level,

333
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:27,140
but I mean that's,
that's the price you pay when you're,

334
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,990
you pervert or what?
Just promiscuous.

335
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:32,770
Just taking a chance.
It's funny in this,

336
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:33,850
uh,
I stopped saying,

337
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:36,510
I still say it out of the day,
but I thought to myself,

338
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,340
am I a pervert?
Like I always think perversely,

339
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,730
I'm like not kind,
Kinda like victims.

340
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,160
Like I don't like uh,
I don't like,

341
00:13:42,161 --> 00:13:45,160
like drunk chicks.
I like at one point in my career I did,

342
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:49,240
but I remember I was on the road and I,
I this girl massage me and she was so

343
00:13:49,241 --> 00:13:51,550
fucking sexy and she stuck her hand in
my mouth,

344
00:13:51,551 --> 00:13:54,520
which I never thought I would like I'd
never had anybody just talk her hand in

345
00:13:54,521 --> 00:13:55,960
her mouth.
She was a little dominant.

346
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:59,230
Then the first time she massaged me I
was naked and she like pushed my dick

347
00:13:59,231 --> 00:14:01,870
out of the way.
Like it was a disgusting item and it was

348
00:14:01,871 --> 00:14:05,650
so hot that she did that.
But we didn't hook up.

349
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:10,860
She just moved by Dick
and I told you that was one of the

350
00:14:12,191 --> 00:14:14,110
sexiest thing and I didn't see her for a
year.

351
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,700
And then we,
Mr again,

352
00:14:15,701 --> 00:14:18,220
she understood that like dominance and I
kinda liked her feet a little bit but

353
00:14:18,221 --> 00:14:19,500
there was nothing inappropriate,
happy,

354
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,343
Kinda liked her feet.

355
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,760
Yeah,
she was barefoot and I was just trying

356
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:24,580
to check it out.
And so it was subtly dominant but she

357
00:14:24,581 --> 00:14:27,580
wasn't jerking me off or anything.
And then she stuck her hand in my mouth.

358
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:29,410
It was out of my mouth.
That's where it started.

359
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:31,390
The hand in the mouth was like the first
thing.

360
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,120
Yeah.
But that was after the Dick thing a

361
00:14:33,121 --> 00:14:34,570
while ago,
but she just read me like,

362
00:14:34,571 --> 00:14:36,450
you know,
people couldn't read you like a real,

363
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:38,260
a woman that you liked can fucking read
you.

364
00:14:38,261 --> 00:14:41,500
And they just get it and it's intuitive
and you don't have to go do this.

365
00:14:41,501 --> 00:14:44,170
They just kind of do it.
It's so weird.

366
00:14:44,171 --> 00:14:47,080
That's a weird thing to do though.
Never ever occurred to me.

367
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:49,840
You never saw it never occurred to you.
But once she did it,

368
00:14:49,841 --> 00:14:50,990
you thought it was really hot because
her,

369
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,730
her hands were clean little massage oil.

370
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:56,090
But I mean she was just like.
I always wondered,

371
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:58,650
I honestly don't remember,
it might've been coco coconut or

372
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,580
might've been a scentless.
It was,

373
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,580
it was more of the,
uh,

374
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:03,200
like the dis,
the partying.

375
00:15:03,201 --> 00:15:06,940
I think I just kind of kissed her finger
and she just stuck her hand and um,

376
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:08,420
anyway,
I wound up hanging out with her.

377
00:15:08,421 --> 00:15:13,421
She came to one of my shows and she came
with a friend on the early show and then

378
00:15:13,491 --> 00:15:18,260
she came back on the late show at the
end by herself and she came to my hotel

379
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:22,430
and she was so drunk and we were fooling
around and I didn't realize how drunk

380
00:15:22,431 --> 00:15:23,890
she was.
I went down on her for a second.

381
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,130
I'm like,
she's fucked up.

382
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,010
Like,
you know how you realize that this is

383
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:29,160
not,
I don't want to be a part of this.

384
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:30,600
So I'm like,
I don't have sex with her.

385
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:32,780
It's just too fucked up.
And she wanted me to fuck her in the

386
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:35,450
ass.
She put her ass up in the air so he

387
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,620
fucked me in the ass.
Wow.

388
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:40,220
And when someone is that drunk,
it's hard to go like you're too fucked

389
00:15:40,221 --> 00:15:42,260
up because you were sober 100 percent.
Yeah,

390
00:15:42,261 --> 00:15:43,760
that's right.
You don't drink at all and it'll happen

391
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:44,930
since you were like 19,
right?

392
00:15:44,931 --> 00:15:46,130
Yeah,
I quit when I was young,

393
00:15:46,131 --> 00:15:51,131
so it's a to me and it never turned me
onto to get someone who's sloppy,

394
00:15:52,491 --> 00:15:56,030
like I don't know what you really want
to do and it's just,

395
00:15:56,031 --> 00:15:58,790
I'm not going to chance you coming out
of it and feeling like I did something

396
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,020
wrong.
Fuck that.

397
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:04,220
And plus she was loaded and she had,
she had actually driven to the hotel.

398
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,180
So I,
you know,

399
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,110
she,
she was a.

400
00:16:06,111 --> 00:16:06,651
I'm like,
look,

401
00:16:06,651 --> 00:16:08,930
let's just hang out and thank God she
got sick.

402
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,810
Like I was the only time I've ever been
happy to have a girl fucking puke

403
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,460
because she's like,
I'm so fucked up.

404
00:16:13,461 --> 00:16:13,761
I'm like,
oh,

405
00:16:13,761 --> 00:16:15,890
it's okay.
And she's apologizing because he pooky.

406
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:16,940
I'm like,
it's okay.

407
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:20,590
And she let me call her and over she let
me get her on the sheet.

408
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:25,600
I had to talk about her taking her car,
but she let me get her an uber home and

409
00:16:26,421 --> 00:16:28,070
uh,
that worked out okay.

410
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:30,440
But that should get back to her after
that.

411
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,730
No,
that was the last time I was in town.

412
00:16:31,731 --> 00:16:34,250
We still talked after that.
Um,

413
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,000
but I'm so happy I didn't fuck her
because I wouldn't have felt.

414
00:16:38,001 --> 00:16:41,660
I never felt I don't feel good about.
I don't like somebody who it means too

415
00:16:41,661 --> 00:16:44,290
much to them either.
Like somebody who's like looking at you

416
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:44,691
like,
oh,

417
00:16:44,691 --> 00:16:46,280
I care for you.
Like if I don't care.

418
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:48,620
Man.
Was that the case with her?

419
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:49,341
No,
no,

420
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,330
no.
She was just too drunk.

421
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,820
But I've had that where I think that
sometimes like,

422
00:16:52,821 --> 00:16:54,590
you know how guys will lie to fuck women
will say like,

423
00:16:54,591 --> 00:16:55,690
yeah,
I love you when we don't.

424
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:57,920
They'll lie and they'll go,
I just want sex.

425
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:02,060
But they really want love after it.
And if I sense that someone is doing

426
00:17:02,061 --> 00:17:04,070
that,
I still feel like I'm a liar.

427
00:17:04,071 --> 00:17:07,670
If I pretend I don't know what she's
doing so I won't do it.

428
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,100
Yeah.
You're a sensitive guy.

429
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,710
You're trying to avoid the bad feels.
Yeah.

430
00:17:12,711 --> 00:17:14,510
I just don't want to be a creep.
Like it's not even.

431
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,950
I don't even think I'm doing anything
good.

432
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:16,311
It's like,
yeah,

433
00:17:16,311 --> 00:17:18,380
you're not supposed to fuck someone
who's so drunk that she's going to

434
00:17:18,381 --> 00:17:19,400
vomit.
Like,

435
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,160
you know what I mean?
Like it's almost like I'm not a good guy

436
00:17:22,161 --> 00:17:24,440
for not fucking her,
but someone is fucked up if they do.

437
00:17:24,441 --> 00:17:25,101
It's like if,
you know,

438
00:17:25,101 --> 00:17:27,290
she's like that loaded and you stick it
in her ass.

439
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,040
Come on dude.
Do you know she,

440
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:31,880
I think she would do it sober.
So it's like,

441
00:17:31,881 --> 00:17:33,270
then I would be fine.
Right,

442
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:34,310
right,
right.

443
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,121
But anyway,
I don't,

444
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:37,370
I,
I find like I don't like the older I

445
00:17:37,371 --> 00:17:41,000
get,
the less I like anyone who's not right

446
00:17:41,001 --> 00:17:43,650
here,
like in thinking the same way we're,

447
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:47,130
we're being.
I just don't like a predatory feelings.

448
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:48,510
Just never turned me on.
Yeah.

449
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:49,980
You know where that is too.
That's also

450
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,700
like as you get older you realize like
any kind of confrontation,

451
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:57,210
any kind of negative feeling that stuff
ruins your day,

452
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:02,240
clings to you for however long you
choose to hang onto it and any sort of

453
00:18:02,851 --> 00:18:04,860
negative interaction that you have in
another person.

454
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,290
This is bad.
It's just bad.

455
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:11,190
I tell people that all the time when
like when people start flame wars with

456
00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:12,660
people online like,
look man,

457
00:18:12,661 --> 00:18:15,240
what's a flame wars?
That's just what everybody's like

458
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:17,280
shitting on people on twitter.
I'm like,

459
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,460
don't get invested in this because even
if you win,

460
00:18:20,461 --> 00:18:22,260
even if you make this person feel
terrible,

461
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:23,850
like you're gonna,
you're gonna.

462
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,830
This is going to claim to.
I've done it before.

463
00:18:25,831 --> 00:18:30,540
I know the feeling that the insulting
thing and the main thing and the

464
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:34,860
negative feelings thing and any kind of
weird confrontation that you have with

465
00:18:34,861 --> 00:18:38,850
human beings where one person walks away
from it feeling terrible,

466
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:40,290
like those things clean.

467
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:42,180
They hang onto you.
You know,

468
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,140
and it's most of the time,
not necessarily like my job is I have

469
00:18:46,141 --> 00:18:48,060
ego like everybody else.
So it says something.

470
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:50,040
Someone said it was Shitty,
like as Comedians,

471
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:53,010
I think just to respond because you're
used to doing it alive room,

472
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,540
but after a while I'm like,
what?

473
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:56,370
What is the satisfaction eat?
Like you said,

474
00:18:56,371 --> 00:18:58,370
even if you win,
who gives a WHO gives a fuck?

475
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,780
Heres wow.
I made a guy feel worse than he was

476
00:19:00,781 --> 00:19:02,760
trying to make me feel.
You know,

477
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,820
that's not why I got into the business.
I think ended up business to spread joy,

478
00:19:05,821 --> 00:19:06,421
but it's like,
you know,

479
00:19:06,421 --> 00:19:08,430
I'm a comic.
I'm not here to make people feel shitty.

480
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,400
Yeah,
I mean the best part about a show is

481
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:15,270
when you're killing and the best part
about killing is a whole room full of

482
00:19:15,271 --> 00:19:16,540
people feel great,
right?

483
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:20,110
Everybody's laughing hard.
You see it when you look out and

484
00:19:20,111 --> 00:19:21,910
someone's face and like,
yeah,

485
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:22,860
they're,
they're crying,

486
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:25,800
laughing.
That's a positive feeling and when you

487
00:19:25,801 --> 00:19:28,470
get into a neg,
any sort of a negative situation with

488
00:19:28,471 --> 00:19:32,160
someone that's just as simple as a girl
pretending she just wants sex,

489
00:19:32,161 --> 00:19:35,220
but she really wants to love and then
when she's leaving she feels bummed out

490
00:19:35,221 --> 00:19:38,550
and then you feel bummed out.
And then you get a tax from her,

491
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,880
like was that all that it was to you?
And like,

492
00:19:40,881 --> 00:19:45,881
Oh God no fucking gross.
You know that all those negative things,

493
00:19:45,961 --> 00:19:47,130
man,
as you get older,

494
00:19:47,131 --> 00:19:50,520
you realize you've sort of data chunk.
You sort of add up all the ones that

495
00:19:50,521 --> 00:19:51,540
you've had in your life.
You go up,

496
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,430
I know what this is,
I see this common.

497
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:55,710
Yeah.
So you learned to back off.

498
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,180
Let's just be friends I don't want.

499
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,910
A lot of times if someone comes over,
like I might fuck around with it a

500
00:19:59,911 --> 00:20:02,010
little bit,
but I don't want to put my Dick in

501
00:20:02,011 --> 00:20:04,740
someone until I've hung with it at least
once or twice.

502
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,360
So they.
This way,

503
00:20:06,361 --> 00:20:08,700
if we fooled around a little bit and
they walk away and they don't feel good,

504
00:20:08,701 --> 00:20:09,660
they're like,
well we didn't fuck.

505
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,600
I don't want anybody.
I just don't want to be somebody Mr.

506
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,610
Yeah,
yeah,

507
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:14,250
yeah.
I've been before and that feels shitty

508
00:20:14,251 --> 00:20:15,660
about it.
I never feel good about it.

509
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:18,330
Isn't it funny that there's like stages
of things you could do?

510
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:20,190
Like you hug someone,
it doesn't mean anything.

511
00:20:20,191 --> 00:20:23,010
You could hug a coworker,
you could hug a friend and I'll hug you.

512
00:20:23,011 --> 00:20:23,860
It doesn't mean anything.
Sure.

513
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:26,550
But then there's like hugging and
kissing.

514
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,650
Oh,
you took it to another level.

515
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,180
Now you touched lips.

516
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:33,050
Wuh holding hands.
Like you could hold hands with a friend.

517
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,590
Say It's good to see you.
It's good to see.

518
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:38,160
You could shake hands with someone and
that's just a business transaction.

519
00:20:38,161 --> 00:20:39,390
Hello Bob.
Hello Mike.

520
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:41,310
No problem there.
You know,

521
00:20:41,311 --> 00:20:43,500
but when you stick your dick inside
someone.

522
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:45,120
Oh,
things get weird.

523
00:20:45,121 --> 00:20:47,680
Yeah.
It gets a little more connected and it

524
00:20:47,681 --> 00:20:50,170
feels more connected.
They certainly feel more connected to

525
00:20:50,171 --> 00:20:50,831
you.
So yeah.

526
00:20:50,831 --> 00:20:53,770
And if I do the first shitty reason I
know it and I don't feel good about it.

527
00:20:53,771 --> 00:20:54,570
And I'm like,
well,

528
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:56,080
when you put your Dick in their ass,
like,

529
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:59,080
this just got crazy.
Yeah,

530
00:20:59,081 --> 00:20:59,930
this has got great.

531
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:05,260
He just took it to the wild place.
Like,

532
00:21:05,261 --> 00:21:07,900
Oh boy,
I haven't fucked anyone in the ass so

533
00:21:07,901 --> 00:21:12,160
long dude.
And all of years years I've just,

534
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,770
I don't know what it is.
I'm just running out of steam,

535
00:21:14,771 --> 00:21:18,340
I guess as I get
fucking petering out.

536
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:20,440
No,
it seems like you're being more

537
00:21:20,441 --> 00:21:23,210
considerate as you get older.
It's interesting and I agree with you.

538
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,940
Your perception.
I think you're a pervert,

539
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:26,590
but I don't think you're a bad.
Perfect.

540
00:21:26,591 --> 00:21:29,680
I think what you were saying was that
you are not a negative person.

541
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,050
You're not a creep.
You're not a mean person,

542
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:33,310
you know,
that's.

543
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,920
I don't think pervert is a bad thing.
I think it's hilarious.

544
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:37,870
You know,
like when you start talking about feet

545
00:21:37,871 --> 00:21:39,670
or all the weird shit,
that girl putting her hand in your

546
00:21:39,671 --> 00:21:40,510
mouth,
that's a pervert.

547
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,670
Hey guys,
in a bad part,

548
00:21:41,671 --> 00:21:43,930
like it doesn't,
doesn't make me feel bad.

549
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,840
Like I don't think of you in a negative
way at all.

550
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:49,800
I think it's a positive thing because
you're honest about what turns you on

551
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,520
what you get excited by.
Yeah.

552
00:21:51,521 --> 00:21:53,980
And it helped.
Like Google is my friend and my enemy,

553
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:55,420
like when I'm dating,
um,

554
00:21:55,421 --> 00:21:59,170
I really have had a many girls google me
and it just,

555
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:01,440
that's all she wrote.
He never good.

556
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:05,380
Like if they don't know me beforehand
finished

557
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:09,640
because they google stuff and they find
it or not,

558
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,440
then.
Well that's a good.

559
00:22:11,441 --> 00:22:13,180
That's a trooper there.
He got a party,

560
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:17,320
you gotta you got a great girl.
If she meets me not knowing anything and

561
00:22:17,321 --> 00:22:19,170
googles and then reads,
which you can read and goes,

562
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,410
Oh wow,
this guy's even better than.

563
00:22:20,411 --> 00:22:22,360
I thought.
She's phenomenal.

564
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:24,210
But that's very,
very rare.

565
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:25,773
You know,
it's,

566
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:26,610
it's,
it's not.

567
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:29,170
It just doesn't happen very often.
Well it seems like though they would

568
00:22:29,171 --> 00:22:31,450
find you though.
I mean there's a spectrum of human

569
00:22:31,451 --> 00:22:32,170
beings,
right?

570
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:34,120
Yeah.
And they would find you like,

571
00:22:34,121 --> 00:22:36,100
well this is what I'm looking for.
Yeah,

572
00:22:36,101 --> 00:22:37,470
I do get that too.
Like she,

573
00:22:37,471 --> 00:22:38,390
like,
like I,

574
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,750
I,
it's a very narrowed corridor of people,

575
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:43,870
but the ones who do really show up with
their gear package.

576
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,850
Well we say narrow corridor or a people
though.

577
00:22:51,851 --> 00:22:55,810
I mean I kind of feel like that's the
same way with everybody really.

578
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:59,440
Like when it comes down to like who?
Who's attracted to you and likes you.

579
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:02,500
Generally it is kind of a narrow
corridor of people,

580
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,980
but most of the time you don't find that
corridor,

581
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,060
you know,
like at least with a guy like you,

582
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,110
a girl can google you.
Yes.

583
00:23:09,111 --> 00:23:11,200
You know,
like some regular guy,

584
00:23:11,201 --> 00:23:14,170
like what are the odds that she's going
to know his sexual proclivities and all

585
00:23:14,171 --> 00:23:16,620
the weird shit he's into and you know
how,

586
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:19,420
how open he has been about his
relationships on the radio.

587
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:22,360
Pretty pretty hard to find.
I mean,

588
00:23:22,361 --> 00:23:24,630
so you know that thoreau quote,
I was bringing this,

589
00:23:24,631 --> 00:23:25,930
I bring it up too much.
I know folks,

590
00:23:25,931 --> 00:23:28,570
people listening,
but most men live lives of quiet

591
00:23:28,571 --> 00:23:29,404
desperation.

592
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,930
That's a great quote.
Fuck yet is.

593
00:23:31,931 --> 00:23:34,780
I listened to that quote all the time.
I read that quote all the time.

594
00:23:34,781 --> 00:23:37,720
I think of that quote all the time
because I think it's one of those things

595
00:23:37,721 --> 00:23:41,430
that we just do and we don't address and
we don't.

596
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:46,090
Especially if you work in the public
sector or you work in business rather,

597
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,020
you know,
you're a guy,

598
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:51,290
works in an office wearing a suit and
tie and you're acting as normal as he

599
00:23:51,291 --> 00:23:52,550
can.
You know,

600
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:54,830
it's,
there's a lot of that going on out there

601
00:23:54,831 --> 00:23:57,080
where people are pretending to be
someone who they're not.

602
00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:00,750
It's a huge problem and it's one of the
things that you're seeing these days.

603
00:24:00,751 --> 00:24:02,480
And I wanted to bring this up with you.
Now that you're here,

604
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:05,120
Jamie,
pull up my twitter profile.

605
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:09,380
There was a tweet that I posted last
night that I found this guy got in

606
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:13,730
trouble for a fucking joke and he wound
up leaving this,

607
00:24:13,731 --> 00:24:15,500
uh,
this company that,

608
00:24:15,501 --> 00:24:18,170
uh,
I think he's involved with video games.

609
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:21,280
He's been on Dave Rubin show and Dave
Rubin was a raven and Brown.

610
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:23,790
Look at this.
Look what this guy wrote.

611
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:26,000
Let's go click on the one on the left,
right there.

612
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:29,630
This is what he wrote,
a piece and quiet hashtag a day without

613
00:24:29,631 --> 00:24:32,630
a woman just to fucking joke.
Just real simple job.

614
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,220
Now go to the next one.
Jamie.

615
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:38,390
Look with the fucking international
business times wrote kind of funnies.

616
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:43,420
Collin Moriarty resigns after targeting.
Women in racist joke insists it's his

617
00:24:46,101 --> 00:24:51,101
personal decision to resign racist race
known as women or women of fucking race.

618
00:24:52,821 --> 00:24:54,980
Now,
did you know that that a dad joke about

619
00:24:54,981 --> 00:24:58,520
women is racist.
Get some brain surgeons over there.

620
00:24:58,521 --> 00:24:59,390
I'd be.
It's got,

621
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:01,430
wow,
that's crazy.

622
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:05,000
Get Some Vac vacancies for real
journalists to click on that,

623
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:06,590
that,
that quote again,

624
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:08,240
look at this international business
times.

625
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:10,610
Fuck you.
Why did he resign?

626
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,480
Whoever this guy is.
What does this guy by Mike like Luke's,

627
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:16,670
whatever her name is.
Fuck you man.

628
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:18,440
That is what you are doing,
right?

629
00:25:18,441 --> 00:25:21,140
That is virtue signaling at its very
worst.

630
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:25,160
You know that's not a racist joke.
That is that what you did is you.

631
00:25:25,161 --> 00:25:29,900
You targeted that guy,
you went after that guy and you did it

632
00:25:29,901 --> 00:25:31,890
in a very deceptive way.
That is,

633
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:33,680
it is.
If anything,

634
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:37,250
it's just a joke and you might not like
it.

635
00:25:37,251 --> 00:25:39,470
You might think,
well that's not really good.

636
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:41,420
If you're working in an environment with
women,

637
00:25:41,421 --> 00:25:42,980
you know,
like you don't want to hear them talk

638
00:25:42,981 --> 00:25:47,420
like that might be sexist.
It's a fucking joke and saying that it's

639
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:49,210
racist.
Is it?

640
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:52,300
That is so fucking deceptive.
Manipulative.

641
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:54,440
At least think I flipped back though
column Loreal.

642
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:56,510
I don't know why he resigned.
Maybe they're going to fire him,

643
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,250
but what's this guy's articles say,
well,

644
00:25:58,251 --> 00:26:00,820
how does he tie in race and it's got
that he has to have some.

645
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:02,540
Let's go to the.
Let's go to the article.

646
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,840
There's no,
there's no fucking connection.

647
00:26:05,841 --> 00:26:08,850
It's crazy.
How could there be a connection in

648
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,030
Delano?
Unless that's a race.

649
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:16,360
Unless women are a fucking race.
It's just crazy that someone would think

650
00:26:16,671 --> 00:26:18,330
that it's okay to do that.
I liked that.

651
00:26:18,331 --> 00:26:20,300
This guy's punching back though.
I kind kinda liked that.

652
00:26:20,301 --> 00:26:22,310
He's not just taking the quietly of
apologizing.

653
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:25,550
Well,
he quit whatever organization that is,

654
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,290
that he was working for kind of funny
and just decide and so many people that

655
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,020
he was working with shit on him for that
joke.

656
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,100
It's just a God damn joke.
What,

657
00:26:35,101 --> 00:26:39,860
why is everybody so sensitive today and
is it that they're so sensitive or is it

658
00:26:39,861 --> 00:26:44,550
that they're super ready to jump down
other throats because they sensed that

659
00:26:44,551 --> 00:26:47,550
this is a very hostile environment and
when you tell jokes,

660
00:26:47,551 --> 00:26:48,384
people are what?

661
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,130
What are you doing?
Is this it?

662
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,970
Okay when you.
Oh,

663
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:54,600
he updated it.
And by the way,

664
00:26:54,601 --> 00:26:55,620
people,
I don't think it's fair,

665
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:59,900
people we took down the word racist as
you described,

666
00:26:59,901 --> 00:27:01,650
is a joke tweeted by comrades,
racist.

667
00:27:01,651 --> 00:27:04,560
It was not.
The article has been changed to reflect

668
00:27:04,561 --> 00:27:05,820
is still,
fuck you.

669
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:07,620
Fuck you,
fuck you,

670
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:10,920
fuck you man.
This is,

671
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:14,520
we had a real problem today and that
people are jumping down people's throats

672
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:17,610
for jokes and they're,
they're doing it because they sense that

673
00:27:17,611 --> 00:27:19,170
they're soft targets,
that it's,

674
00:27:19,171 --> 00:27:22,360
there's going to be a pylon.
And they sense the pile on the go,

675
00:27:22,361 --> 00:27:23,670
oh,
this guy made a joke about women.

676
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:25,050
Let's get them.
A bunch of people are going to be

677
00:27:25,051 --> 00:27:26,220
getting.
This is a free shot.

678
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:28,800
It's kicking someone while they're down.
It's what it is.

679
00:27:28,801 --> 00:27:31,320
It's a drunk girl at the party and
you're sticking it right in her ass.

680
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:34,530
He basically the same thing mean same
thing with that at all.

681
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,430
No,
no.

682
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:39,770
But if it's the same shitty mentality
behind it is that people like,

683
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:40,900
uh,
people,

684
00:27:40,901 --> 00:27:41,910
uh,
they don't feel offended.

685
00:27:41,911 --> 00:27:45,060
They just feel it's a chance to be mean.
And you can be mean to someone who does

686
00:27:45,061 --> 00:27:47,910
something fucked up or says something
racist or whatever.

687
00:27:47,911 --> 00:27:49,110
So yeah,
people are just content.

688
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,510
That joke is every episode of married
with children.

689
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:53,270
It is.
It's every episode.

690
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,420
Pacing client.
Yeah.

691
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:59,280
A day without a woman.
She's quiet family to come on every

692
00:27:59,281 --> 00:28:02,340
episode of of honeymooners.
So same thing.

693
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,100
That was the war to the moon.
Alice was threatening,

694
00:28:05,101 --> 00:28:06,900
beating her.
I know with his fist,

695
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:14,180
punching her into interstellar space and
it was so great with that though is

696
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:15,960
there's literally people would criticize
that,

697
00:28:15,961 --> 00:28:19,830
but she was the first feminist on tv
because she won every exchange.

698
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:22,350
She was.
She was always right.

699
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:25,760
He was just a big dumb fat cell and he
was already fucking up,

700
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:30,180
always get mad and he would always get
mad and she would all the writing and

701
00:28:30,181 --> 00:28:32,490
that the fucking,
the,

702
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,001
the,
the,

703
00:28:33,001 --> 00:28:36,150
there'll be emasculating line.
She had some of the best lines.

704
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:39,150
I don't want my salary to leak out your
salary.

705
00:28:39,151 --> 00:28:41,190
Couldn't drip out.
Oh,

706
00:28:41,191 --> 00:28:45,330
what a fucking great line.
Your salary couldn't drip out a great

707
00:28:45,331 --> 00:28:46,650
show.
How humiliating.

708
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,720
And you know what?
One other thing about that show that was

709
00:28:48,721 --> 00:28:50,440
so great about the honeymooners.
Well that was the last.

710
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:52,410
A lot of previous sitcoms.
No,

711
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:55,440
I mean this is a,
there was a groundbreaking new thing at

712
00:28:55,441 --> 00:28:57,010
the time that was,
it was on the Ca,

713
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:59,050
I think cavalcade it was called.
It was something like the,

714
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,840
there's like an old y'all.
Last ones were like,

715
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,420
some of them are 15 minutes,
20 minutes.

716
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,950
They were part of,
as a sketch show.

717
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,620
The honeymooners was a sketch in an
overall show.

718
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:09,150
It'd be like,
it was like dice when he started.

719
00:29:09,151 --> 00:29:11,480
He was just dice as a character and
clay's act.

720
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:14,080
That's what that was.
Wow.

721
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:17,970
It just became this thing which didn't
do well and they uh,

722
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,800
came back years later,
but.

723
00:29:19,801 --> 00:29:21,840
So honey,
but you can never do that shit today

724
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,930
where you can do all in the family.
You can do.

725
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,730
There was a million movies that you
couldn't do.

726
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:29,160
You know what I mean?
You try watching like older movies.

727
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,410
What was it that we looked at recently
that we were lucky.

728
00:29:31,411 --> 00:29:34,670
There's no way you could do that today.
There was a an old movie that was a

729
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,410
really fucking funny movie from like the
nineties.

730
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:39,990
I remember which one.
It won't kill a mockingbird.

731
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,510
That guy's a bad guesser that
definitely.

732
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,050
You probably couldn't do that one
either.

733
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:45,370
No,
it was like one of those.

734
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,061
Oh,
oh,

735
00:29:46,061 --> 00:29:49,570
it was national lampoon's vacation.
My good Lord.

736
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:52,840
I watch national lampoon's vacation and
it's just like there's no fucking way

737
00:29:52,841 --> 00:29:54,840
you could do that movie today.
There you would get to.

738
00:29:54,841 --> 00:29:57,190
I don't remember it.
I've seen this sexist,

739
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:00,040
misogynist Dick.
Like everything.

740
00:30:00,041 --> 00:30:00,950
Yeah,
like you.

741
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,780
There's no humor.
Humor has to be.

742
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:08,380
It has to pass like these rigid filters.
Now.

743
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:10,990
It's not as simple as say something
inappropriate,

744
00:30:10,991 --> 00:30:14,440
but that's still funny that you don't
necessarily mean like one of my favorite

745
00:30:14,441 --> 00:30:18,280
comics and I think a great one of the
greatest of all time is Roseanne Barr.

746
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:21,640
I really put her as very funny.
I put her as one of the most important

747
00:30:21,641 --> 00:30:24,340
comics of all time because I think that
would Roseanne did,

748
00:30:24,341 --> 00:30:29,341
was she.
She had that powerful fuck you comedy as

749
00:30:30,071 --> 00:30:32,890
a woman,
and it was really one of the first ever

750
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:36,730
because women were more sedate in there,
even if they were really good comics

751
00:30:36,731 --> 00:30:40,150
like Joan rivers,
that it was a different sort of style of

752
00:30:40,151 --> 00:30:40,900
delivery.

753
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:45,460
But Roseanne came out like a hardcore
man club comic,

754
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:48,160
you know,
and she was shitting on her husband for

755
00:30:48,161 --> 00:30:53,161
being a fucking loser or be at fat and
it was just hard and slamming and I

756
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:57,300
didn't take offense as a man.
I didn't hear those jokes and go,

757
00:30:57,390 --> 00:31:01,640
you can't believe she shitting unmet
can't believe she's shitting on man.

758
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:04,630
It was just funny to stop this.
That's just success.

759
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:07,270
And it was so this guy saying,
you know,

760
00:31:07,271 --> 00:31:10,030
uh,
peace and quiet like I'm sorry if you're

761
00:31:10,031 --> 00:31:13,150
not a yappy cut,
that joke shouldn't offend you.

762
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,070
Okay.
If you're a person who's a great

763
00:31:15,071 --> 00:31:17,320
conversationalist and you also happen to
have a vagina,

764
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,680
that shouldn't bother you even in the
slightest and it probably doesn't.

765
00:31:20,681 --> 00:31:21,351
It's just like,
oh,

766
00:31:21,351 --> 00:31:23,500
I know that should bother me,
so I'm going to be shitty about it.

767
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,760
I don't even think people care that
much.

768
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,860
I think they just liked to to attack
other people.

769
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:28,690
Exactly.
That's what I'm talking about and that's

770
00:31:28,691 --> 00:31:31,660
why fuck you to that guy who wrote that
article and especially fuck you.

771
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:33,350
Because he called him a racist.
Yeah.

772
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:36,630
He did that on purpose because he knew
it was going to be clickbait is going to

773
00:31:36,631 --> 00:31:39,880
get people to go to that article and it
was going to get people more excited

774
00:31:39,881 --> 00:31:42,730
about it without even reading it because
all they need is the article.

775
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:46,660
Most people are so fucking busy,
they don't have time to read the whole

776
00:31:46,661 --> 00:31:48,820
thing.
They're so quick to pull the trigger.

777
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,320
All they.
All they need is the title.

778
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:51,520
What's the title?
Oh,

779
00:31:51,521 --> 00:31:53,170
that's good enough.
Fuck him.

780
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:54,093
Let's tweet.
Adam.

781
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:55,720
Yeah,
let's shame him.

782
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:57,450
Yeah.
Did you ever interview Jon Ronson?

783
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,940
He's great.
Have John.

784
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,340
I talked to him that had him on before.

785
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:02,750
Really interesting guy about shame and
uh,

786
00:32:02,751 --> 00:32:03,940
um,
I always feel it.

787
00:32:03,941 --> 00:32:06,250
So I kind of understand that if there's
a weird.

788
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:07,223
It's just,
it's a good.

789
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:10,600
Everybody's afraid of people fight so
they don't feel ashamed and have to back

790
00:32:10,601 --> 00:32:14,650
off limit the fucking amazingly powerful
thing like you know,

791
00:32:14,651 --> 00:32:18,130
the reason guys shoot or go on a
shooting spree at work is because

792
00:32:18,131 --> 00:32:20,500
they've been shamed because they had
been fired or because their wife is

793
00:32:20,501 --> 00:32:24,430
sleep with somebody else and the Shaman.
It's the worst fucking thing.

794
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:27,220
Well,
shame is a new thing that people are

795
00:32:27,221 --> 00:32:28,650
going after.
You know,

796
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:33,660
like fat shaming and slut shaming.
These are like completely new ideas in

797
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,360
American culture.
This is.

798
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:38,740
There was no slut shaming when we were
kids.

799
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,060
He never even fucking heard of it as a
concept.

800
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,950
Now we a call a girl,
a slut and that was it.

801
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:43,671
And they,
they say like,

802
00:32:43,671 --> 00:32:45,170
well girl,
she'll be able to be slots to and they

803
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:47,550
shouldn't be shamed or fat.
People like,

804
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:49,250
hey look,
I don't care if you fucking fat,

805
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,610
but if you're sitting next to me and
you're taking up more space than you

806
00:32:52,611 --> 00:32:54,850
should on a plane,
I do have a problem with it because

807
00:32:54,851 --> 00:32:56,540
you're making a decision that's fucking
me up.

808
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:58,730
I don't care if you eat.
I literally left people that live in a

809
00:32:58,731 --> 00:33:00,710
house and have to be created out.
Good for them.

810
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,630
I don't care if you sit on the toilet
forever,

811
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:04,280
knock yourself out.
It doesn't bother me.

812
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:06,500
I'm not going to shame those people.
But if you know,

813
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:07,970
if you're sitting next to me,
I'm like,

814
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,280
what the fuck?
You know,

815
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,153
it's,
it's,

816
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:13,640
it's look,
being fat is a shameful thing.

817
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:17,270
It just is.
It brings people shame.

818
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:18,650
I mean,
that's why there's humor in it.

819
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:20,720
That's what I want.
A fat guy takes off his shirt and he

820
00:33:20,721 --> 00:33:22,700
doesn't give a fuck.
It's hilarious because like,

821
00:33:22,701 --> 00:33:24,770
that guy doesn't give a fuck.
He's shameless.

822
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,200
You know,
he,

823
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:26,841
he,
you know,

824
00:33:26,841 --> 00:33:29,000
a guy with a big gut and he's rubbing it
like Buddha.

825
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:30,770
That's,
that's where it's funny,

826
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,210
right?
Because this guy shameless,

827
00:33:32,211 --> 00:33:35,090
he looks disgusting.
Whereas you or I would look at that and

828
00:33:35,091 --> 00:33:35,571
go,
oh,

829
00:33:35,571 --> 00:33:36,920
that was me.
I'd be so sad.

830
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:39,560
He doesn't give a fuck.
And we admire him because he doesn't

831
00:33:39,561 --> 00:33:41,710
give a fuck.
Like the fact that he's like,

832
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:45,740
he literally either he doesn't give a
fuck where he solar shamed devotees loan

833
00:33:45,741 --> 00:33:47,780
to learn how to own it,
so I get to accommodate both.

834
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:49,970
Some people probably so fucked up by it.
They're like,

835
00:33:49,971 --> 00:33:51,530
fuck it,
I'll wear it.

836
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:54,650
And other people just don't give a shit.
There are so many weak,

837
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:59,300
weak,
weak men out there that go after people

838
00:33:59,301 --> 00:34:00,140
for jokes.

839
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:04,670
Like that guy who made the guy call him
moriarty's on his name that made that

840
00:34:04,671 --> 00:34:06,350
joke.
I'm having him on the podcast.

841
00:34:06,351 --> 00:34:07,820
I reached out to him last night after
this.

842
00:34:07,821 --> 00:34:09,560
I was like,
this is so crazy.

843
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,930
So.
And I looked at all his tweets and all

844
00:34:11,931 --> 00:34:13,340
the people that were piling on.
I'm like,

845
00:34:13,341 --> 00:34:15,890
what in the fuck are you guys talking
about?

846
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:18,350
This is so mild,
so silly.

847
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,810
Who Cares?
Peace and quiet.

848
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,370
Jesus Christ,
that's it.

849
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:25,880
That's all takes all it takes for you to
be disappointed with him.

850
00:34:25,881 --> 00:34:26,960
I mean,
so many people,

851
00:34:26,961 --> 00:34:29,570
people that he worked with piled on.
What was kind of funny?

852
00:34:29,571 --> 00:34:30,404
What was the.
What was that?

853
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:32,210
I don't know.
I don't even know what it was.

854
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,760
He says,
I never heard about it until last night

855
00:34:34,761 --> 00:34:38,750
somebody tweeted to me that thing and
then he tweeted that at me that did you

856
00:34:38,751 --> 00:34:40,820
know that it was racist to,
you know,

857
00:34:40,821 --> 00:34:41,880
to make a joke about women.

858
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:43,430
I was like,
what is this?

859
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,590
And then I looked into and I was like,
oh my God,

860
00:34:45,591 --> 00:34:48,290
this is so crazy.
What a Dick that guy was to put that

861
00:34:48,291 --> 00:34:49,840
though.
I wonder if he thought it was racist or

862
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,410
he.
How could he possibly.

863
00:34:51,411 --> 00:34:52,940
I don't know.
It's so simple.

864
00:34:52,941 --> 00:34:54,650
It's such a simple joke.
I mean,

865
00:34:54,651 --> 00:34:58,070
there's no room for error there.
A day without a woman Hashtag a day

866
00:34:58,071 --> 00:35:00,800
without a woman and then a peace and
quiet.

867
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:02,900
That's it.
You see racist there.

868
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:05,480
It's crazy monsters.
It's fucking crazy.

869
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:08,810
Anti human monsters.
They want people to feel pain for almost

870
00:35:08,811 --> 00:35:12,500
no reason whatsoever.
Or they will go out of their way and use

871
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:14,060
any tactic they can.
If they.

872
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:19,100
If they see that it's in their eyes,
it's legit and it's somehow or another

873
00:35:19,101 --> 00:35:23,750
warranted and it just that goddamn
virtue signaling because somebody's weak

874
00:35:23,751 --> 00:35:26,600
men out there,
that virtue signal they'd like to attack

875
00:35:26,601 --> 00:35:30,080
other men for anything that shows that
they're better than that man.

876
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:33,930
So you can get a little pat on the back,
a little cyber pat orange.

877
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:36,620
Hi.
Good people have been doing it lately

878
00:35:36,621 --> 00:35:37,740
politically too,
and it's like,

879
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:39,720
I don't care how people feel Dr Pollack
fine,

880
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:42,770
but it's like the obsessive tweeting the
same thing over and over.

881
00:35:42,771 --> 00:35:43,730
It's like they just want people to go
like,

882
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:44,521
wow,
this guy.

883
00:35:44,521 --> 00:35:46,470
Really?
Where's it shut up.

884
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:47,423
Yeah,
exactly.

885
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:48,780
Exactly.
Well fuck.

886
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:51,050
I literally,
I don't have and I just,

887
00:35:51,051 --> 00:35:52,720
I took it out because I tripped on the
punchline.

888
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:55,020
I'm special.
I had a trump bit and I was listening

889
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:56,970
and I,
I fucked up.

890
00:35:56,971 --> 00:35:59,850
One of the final words was no way to fix
it because I'm just a dope and I

891
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:02,370
literally was about,
grabbed a pussy and I said,

892
00:36:02,371 --> 00:36:07,371
drag her pussy voice over it.
I try to because I said it earlier in

893
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:08,640
the thing and I try,
but I'm like,

894
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,593
just take it out.

895
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:11,990
Fuck it.
Who Cares?

896
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:13,650
It wasn't a swan enough,
but anyway,

897
00:36:13,651 --> 00:36:14,700
it was like,
okay,

898
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:16,290
but I'm like,
I could do this better,

899
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:21,470
but I'm not just saying something cheesy
and cheesy and fucking know over the

900
00:36:21,571 --> 00:36:23,540
head.
Sometimes when I'm doing a bit like

901
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,770
about something that's real current
events like that,

902
00:36:25,771 --> 00:36:29,580
like I am onstage literally searching
for the words as I'm saying them.

903
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:33,510
Like I'm hoping that a new word will
come out or a new angle come out or a

904
00:36:33,511 --> 00:36:35,760
new,
a new perception.

905
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:39,990
Like I'll be able to see,
see an angle of it that I didn't see

906
00:36:39,991 --> 00:36:41,700
before.
And then you know,

907
00:36:41,701 --> 00:36:46,470
sometimes you got to realize also the
bits only have humor in them because

908
00:36:46,471 --> 00:36:48,960
their current.
You have to hit people immediately and

909
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:49,950
they all.
Yeah,

910
00:36:49,951 --> 00:36:53,040
that guy can't believe he did that when
you have to start calling,

911
00:36:53,041 --> 00:36:54,640
remember what?
No,

912
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:55,470
we don't.

913
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:59,100
Unless it's fucking genius.
Like there are some.

914
00:36:59,101 --> 00:37:01,230
Remember Wednesday you could pull,
pull out,

915
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:06,860
but it has it all like I feel like every
bit or every idea and doesn't even

916
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:11,510
necessarily just with jokes but in any
subject that could talk about like they

917
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:15,690
had these subjects have energy to them
and when a subject doesn't have the

918
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:17,940
energy to it,
it just doesn't and you could try to

919
00:37:17,941 --> 00:37:21,150
juice it up and jazz it up,
but I remember there was a guy to put

920
00:37:21,151 --> 00:37:22,660
it.
That's a really good way to put it

921
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,910
because sometimes I have never been able
to put the words on why does all the

922
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,840
sudden something like it's no longer
topical.

923
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:30,330
That's a great way to phrase it.
It doesn't have energy around it.

924
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:33,540
Like in the room.
It's kind of on everybody's mind,

925
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,590
right?
Yeah.

926
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:37,980
Like last night yesterday we're doing a
podcast and we got to the subject of

927
00:37:37,981 --> 00:37:42,981
Brexit and leaving Britain and I could
feel the energy in the podcast drain

928
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,750
because I didn't really give a fuck
about the subject anymore and it's kind

929
00:37:45,751 --> 00:37:49,050
of a tired subject and,
and it's just been beaten down so many

930
00:37:49,051 --> 00:37:51,930
times and it just,
it seemed like there was no energy in

931
00:37:51,931 --> 00:37:52,140
it.

932
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,540
It just seemed like,
oh no,

933
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:55,530
maybe if I lived in England it would be
different.

934
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,440
Maybe if I was over there experiencing
the pros and cons of Brexit,

935
00:37:58,441 --> 00:38:01,070
but to me it was like ideas have.
And then.

936
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,430
But we were talking about artificial
intelligence,

937
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:05,940
the potential of artificial intelligence
taking over the human race.

938
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,880
And that charges me up.
That one gives me like,

939
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:10,860
oh,
this subject has energy to it.

940
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:12,510
This is a subject.
This is,

941
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,190
there's things that have,
they have,

942
00:38:14,191 --> 00:38:15,020
uh,
uh,

943
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:17,080
something to them,
like a,

944
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:19,320
an overall mass to them.
Well,

945
00:38:19,321 --> 00:38:21,660
the word I'm gonna use should make
people want to smack my face,

946
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:24,030
but some board,
some things have explorer ability.

947
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,410
Yes.
I know I'm a complete saying,

948
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:29,250
I acknowledged good word,
but like the Brexit,

949
00:38:29,251 --> 00:38:32,580
you kind of explore and it's done,
but like artificial intelligence,

950
00:38:32,581 --> 00:38:34,680
you could always.
It doesn't feel like you're walking into

951
00:38:34,681 --> 00:38:35,890
a room that's already been searched.

952
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:37,520
Like a lot of times you walk into the
room and say,

953
00:38:37,521 --> 00:38:39,250
I've looked in this room,
I've opened every door.

954
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:42,490
There's really nothing new in here and
it's boring and the audience feels it.

955
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:43,493
Yeah,
it is.

956
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:46,290
But artificial intelligence is always,
you know,

957
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,430
I like dogs.
Do you like cats?

958
00:38:48,431 --> 00:38:50,230
I don't understand.
People like cats.

959
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,300
Yeah.
There's only so many times that someone

960
00:38:52,301 --> 00:38:53,860
can say that until you're like,
oh my God,

961
00:38:53,861 --> 00:38:54,920
I can't do this anymore.
Exactly.

962
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:56,800
I don't care about either one of them.
I'm done.

963
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:59,410
People have been.
I've been riding the idea like immediate

964
00:38:59,411 --> 00:39:02,530
pussies since 1990,
so it's time to step forward.

965
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,320
I've always been immediate pussy fan.
Oh really?

966
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:06,580
Yeah.
I like the bat lips,

967
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:08,740
back wings.
I just don't understand why people

968
00:39:08,741 --> 00:39:10,570
don't.
Do they wrap around your Dick.

969
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,490
It's like this is like an extra gripper.
Yeah,

970
00:39:12,491 --> 00:39:13,390
I liked that a lot too.

971
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:16,150
I'm so happy.
I was just chatting him saying I didn't

972
00:39:16,151 --> 00:39:17,920
say it like that,
but no I am and you know,

973
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:22,390
I was talking to this woman who was
explaining to me how women watching porn

974
00:39:22,391 --> 00:39:26,890
gives him a fucked up self image because
a lot of those women have Lavia surgery.

975
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,590
I hate those labioplasty doctors.
I hate them.

976
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:33,070
The worst.
It's just so crazy that you would remove

977
00:39:33,071 --> 00:39:36,280
pussy skin.
Like because they don't want their pussy

978
00:39:36,281 --> 00:39:37,860
to look like ragged.
They want,

979
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:40,290
don't want it to be like hanging out.
There's no pussies.

980
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:42,520
Never too big.
Like literally you say my pussy is too

981
00:39:42,521 --> 00:39:43,300
big.
Why?

982
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,110
Because sometimes when I'm putting my
shoe on

983
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:51,220
then it's maybe too big
if you trip over while you're jumping

984
00:39:51,221 --> 00:39:54,900
rope.
If it gets done by the leather rope,

985
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:59,070
if it dangles wasp legs.
Constant big.

986
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:04,030
But yeah,
I hate that too.

987
00:40:04,031 --> 00:40:05,280
It drives me crazy.
Like I love.

988
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,600
That's why I talk about it because hey,
it's fun to joke about,

989
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:09,250
but like winning always will email.
Like,

990
00:40:09,251 --> 00:40:12,130
I love that you liked that because I've
been so I'm like,

991
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:14,560
please,
I just don't know why it would be a bad

992
00:40:14,561 --> 00:40:14,980
thing.
It's.

993
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:18,130
I've never understood why it's a bad
thing because some guys don't like it

994
00:40:18,131 --> 00:40:19,420
though.
Some guys like that neat little mean

995
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:20,950
Anthony's talking about that.
Like always go like,

996
00:40:20,951 --> 00:40:23,740
I like a tight little package.
You don't answer the fucking meat and

997
00:40:23,741 --> 00:40:25,930
potatoes guy.
He wants him naked and a tight little

998
00:40:25,931 --> 00:40:28,600
package and that's how he really likes
him.

999
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:30,880
Anthony might lead them a little young
to.

1000
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:32,140
Yeah,
I mean he might like,

1001
00:40:32,141 --> 00:40:33,190
it needs for other reasons.

1002
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:37,600
He might like,
I'm fresh out of the box.

1003
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:39,100
Yeah.
He also enjoys green bananas.

1004
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:46,600
He likes to pick the coconuts off the
tree.

1005
00:40:46,601 --> 00:40:51,390
Really does it over with a machete.
Yeah,

1006
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:55,240
but it was so funny to talk to a guy who
was so opposite me in like that,

1007
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:56,590
but.
But that's.

1008
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:59,940
I almost wish I was like that.
I think that's a simpler thing on that

1009
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:02,260
simpler.
It's just an easier thing to find than

1010
00:41:02,261 --> 00:41:07,240
to have these weird little quirks bummed
out if a girl's pussy is nice and tight

1011
00:41:07,241 --> 00:41:10,470
and trimmed up and no,
because usually by that point that's

1012
00:41:10,471 --> 00:41:13,060
something that our personality I like or
there's something about her scent that I

1013
00:41:13,061 --> 00:41:14,020
like.
There's always,

1014
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,150
you know,
you got to buy an apartment,

1015
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:17,320
you pick your back.
Like,

1016
00:41:17,321 --> 00:41:18,940
okay,
I want it to be in a good location.

1017
00:41:18,941 --> 00:41:20,440
I wanted to have a doorman,
but I want to talk about doors.

1018
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,820
You're going to get two of those three
things.

1019
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:25,240
That's how it is when you get dating,
but what if you were dating a girl and

1020
00:41:25,241 --> 00:41:28,880
she looked like she's,
she's got like good bone structures,

1021
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,720
stick almost like eastern European.
She got big hands.

1022
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:32,351
You're like,
wow,

1023
00:41:32,351 --> 00:41:35,510
this girl's got have immediate pussy and
you get down there and you see scars.

1024
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:37,760
It's happened.
She's got a trimmed up.

1025
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:40,220
Oh,
I don't know if you'd see them.

1026
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:41,750
You know,
I don't.

1027
00:41:41,751 --> 00:41:44,450
I think they do a good job,
but if a woman ever.

1028
00:41:44,451 --> 00:41:45,330
Totally.
She had it.

1029
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,780
Yeah.
You're looking at like a jeweler.

1030
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:53,280
Some articles like bud from the Improv,
Budd Friedman,

1031
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:56,980
shit,
fucking fucker.

1032
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:59,450
Those monocles for.
I don't know what was the deal with

1033
00:41:59,451 --> 00:42:00,261
that?
I don't know.

1034
00:42:00,261 --> 00:42:03,140
They would need it at one point in
history I guess and people just think it

1035
00:42:03,141 --> 00:42:05,480
looks smart.
Do you think it's just for reading?

1036
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:07,550
Like when people needed to read things?
I don't know.

1037
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:09,920
Like why would you want to have
something to hold it in your eye?

1038
00:42:09,921 --> 00:42:12,440
Like one,
one thing like that?

1039
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:16,160
I really don't know the thinking of it.
It looks really uncomfortable and I

1040
00:42:16,161 --> 00:42:17,900
don't know.
I would love to know the history of the

1041
00:42:17,901 --> 00:42:19,100
monocle now.
I have no idea.

1042
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:23,720
Budd Friedman used to put that fucking
thing in his eye and go on stage every

1043
00:42:23,721 --> 00:42:27,170
time we did an evening at the Improv.
Like he thought it was a good thing to

1044
00:42:27,171 --> 00:42:30,140
have a Monaco in his eyes.
Probably after a while it's like a

1045
00:42:30,141 --> 00:42:31,930
muscle,
like that little thing in your cheek and

1046
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:34,080
just go like I probably just holds it
there.

1047
00:42:34,081 --> 00:42:37,910
Like naturally it's like when you have
contacts or leading glasses.

1048
00:42:37,911 --> 00:42:41,990
I had like $25 reading glasses and like
I just can't fucking.

1049
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:43,160
I got to go back to glasses.

1050
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:44,990
It stinks.
40th eight.

1051
00:42:44,991 --> 00:42:45,771
My eyes are going.
Yeah,

1052
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:47,120
my eyes are fucked.
My eyes.

1053
00:42:47,121 --> 00:42:50,180
Are you near or far?
Can you read near like I see you crystal

1054
00:42:50,181 --> 00:42:52,850
clear.
When I Read I put these fuckers on other

1055
00:42:52,851 --> 00:42:53,920
prescription.
No,

1056
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:58,940
I got to go to a doctor.
I just went and I went to look at the

1057
00:42:58,941 --> 00:43:01,910
charts and found out what it was and
that's when I got to do because I bought

1058
00:43:01,911 --> 00:43:04,940
like literally a $25 pair of downstairs
at cvs and it didn't work.

1059
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:05,931
No,
they're fine,

1060
00:43:05,931 --> 00:43:09,420
but I don't think they're good enough
because I look up and it's like my face

1061
00:43:09,421 --> 00:43:10,280
is in gauze.
I'm like,

1062
00:43:10,281 --> 00:43:12,830
I gotTa fucking rock.
I pull them off.

1063
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:14,990
They're probably fuck with your eyes if
they're not.

1064
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:17,870
Did not the correct way.
That's why I don't want to make my eyes

1065
00:43:17,871 --> 00:43:22,580
worse because I had lasik back I guess I
know 10 years ago,

1066
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:25,220
but that's starting to not work anymore
because you know,

1067
00:43:25,221 --> 00:43:26,480
you get older,
you got lasik.

1068
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:28,580
Was it for nearsightedness or
farsightedness?

1069
00:43:28,581 --> 00:43:30,590
I can't see far away.
So near sighted.

1070
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:33,230
Far sighted.
I can't see far away.

1071
00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:35,280
Right?
Isn't that how it works on the near side

1072
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:39,590
because I couldn't see far away,
but now it's the reading like farther

1073
00:43:39,591 --> 00:43:41,800
and farther away.
So that's.

1074
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:44,690
I have a friend who's an ophthalmologist
and he said that it's just one of the

1075
00:43:44,691 --> 00:43:46,940
things that happens as you get older.
Your eyes just don't.

1076
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:48,980
They don't focus the same way as they
used to.

1077
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:50,660
I did Dr. Tami,
you're supposed to live.

1078
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:53,510
My ent guy did my sinus surgery.
He goes,

1079
00:43:53,511 --> 00:43:55,310
yeah,
the human body is designed to live 40

1080
00:43:55,311 --> 00:43:57,710
something years and everything else is
just science and medicine.

1081
00:43:57,711 --> 00:43:59,390
So we break down and that's what
happens.

1082
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:01,690
That's why your eyes go,
that's why cancer is happy.

1083
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:05,210
And he was just saying that these are
all part of just natural.

1084
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:06,270
You know you're not.
When you're born,

1085
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:09,800
you're not designed to live 80 years.
God Damn it.

1086
00:44:09,801 --> 00:44:12,320
I know where you are,
but the last 20 or supposed to suck.

1087
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:12,760
Yeah.
Yeah.

1088
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:13,760
Or they're terrible.
Yeah.

1089
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:15,770
Supposed to get to the point where when
you're on your death bed,

1090
00:44:15,771 --> 00:44:16,730
you're like,
finally,

1091
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:18,680
yeah,
I can't wait for this to happen over

1092
00:44:18,681 --> 00:44:20,090
with.
Yeah.

1093
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:22,070
I don't want to die.
I had been thinking about that a lot

1094
00:44:22,071 --> 00:44:23,660
lately.
Like I really resist the idea of it.

1095
00:44:23,890 --> 00:44:25,850
I don't want to do it.
But do you enjoy life?

1096
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:27,230
Yeah.
Much more now.

1097
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:29,210
Much more than much more.
How much happier?

1098
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:33,060
Much happier because of when Eh,
you know,

1099
00:44:33,061 --> 00:44:34,900
in the last couple of years.
Uh,

1100
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:35,590
I mean,
you know,

1101
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:38,190
I'm doing the show with Sam now.
Sam Roberts show together,

1102
00:44:38,191 --> 00:44:40,180
which has been a lot of fun.
It's a physic,

1103
00:44:40,181 --> 00:44:43,110
you're starting a new thing,
so whenever you get to reset,

1104
00:44:43,111 --> 00:44:43,621
like,
okay,

1105
00:44:43,621 --> 00:44:44,460
I'm doing a new thing now.

1106
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:47,040
It feels bad.
It sounds like you guys are having a

1107
00:44:47,041 --> 00:44:48,290
good time.
Yeah,

1108
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:48,721
yeah,
yeah,

1109
00:44:48,721 --> 00:44:49,590
yeah.
We really are.

1110
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:52,650
Um,
and just with doing other stuff with

1111
00:44:52,651 --> 00:44:54,180
work,
I just feel kind of more grateful than I

1112
00:44:54,181 --> 00:44:56,100
have in a while.
Like with the fucking shut up,

1113
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:58,380
trump being upset.
Fucking idiot.

1114
00:44:58,890 --> 00:45:02,790
Like things are really good and when I
fall into feeling bad I know it's just

1115
00:45:02,791 --> 00:45:04,920
because I'm addicted to feeling bad and
it's bullshit.

1116
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:06,990
Well,
we have such a fucking great job when

1117
00:45:06,991 --> 00:45:11,100
you talk to a person who has a regular
job and they complain about their job,

1118
00:45:11,101 --> 00:45:14,550
but then you think about like the
complaints that you have would be in a

1119
00:45:14,551 --> 00:45:16,000
comic.
It's like God damn it.

1120
00:45:16,001 --> 00:45:17,070
So,
so minimal.

1121
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:18,640
I had a complaint about,
I,

1122
00:45:18,641 --> 00:45:22,370
I had like a legit complaint about,
um,

1123
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:24,330
whatever,
the Australian quantas down to

1124
00:45:24,331 --> 00:45:26,610
Australia,
they fucked me and I was annoyed that

1125
00:45:26,611 --> 00:45:27,391
they just,
they,

1126
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:28,170
they,
um,

1127
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:31,920
the connection didn't wait even though
it was a Qantas plane was late and I

1128
00:45:31,921 --> 00:45:35,070
arrived and my manager was on the plane
waiting for me and they just wouldn't

1129
00:45:35,071 --> 00:45:35,530
let me on.

1130
00:45:35,530 --> 00:45:36,031
And he's like,
yeah,

1131
00:45:36,031 --> 00:45:37,110
we already put the paperwork.
Yeah,

1132
00:45:37,111 --> 00:45:39,330
they would just be an cocked.
And uh,

1133
00:45:39,331 --> 00:45:43,200
they flew me to somewhere else.
It was just a dick blew some complaining

1134
00:45:43,201 --> 00:45:44,610
about it online.
But people,

1135
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:45,720
they don't give a fuck.
They're like,

1136
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:47,610
even though it's a legit complaint to
like,

1137
00:45:47,611 --> 00:45:49,170
fuck you,
you're flying all over the world and

1138
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:51,810
business shut up and not the kind of
right,

1139
00:45:51,811 --> 00:45:54,630
like it's a luxury problem.
It's a problem of,

1140
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:57,720
of okay,
that's not right the way they did it,

1141
00:45:57,721 --> 00:46:00,870
but that's not a bad problem to have in,
in life.

1142
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:03,630
It's so minor in comparison to most
things that people go through.

1143
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:05,910
You know,
when you really stop and think about how

1144
00:46:05,911 --> 00:46:08,310
many people work jobs that they fucking
hate.

1145
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:11,160
Yeah.
It's probably 80 percent of the police.

1146
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,380
The people.
I mean it's probably close to 80.

1147
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:16,860
Well you said the office before things
went through women and googling.

1148
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:18,630
You can't,
if you're an accountant,

1149
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:22,330
you can walk in as an accountant and go,
oh my God,

1150
00:46:22,331 --> 00:46:24,040
a massage last night and she stuck her
feet.

1151
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:25,720
My face,
no stinky,

1152
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:29,340
you know,
it's gotta be 12 people,

1153
00:46:29,341 --> 00:46:33,330
like a lot.
One guy like interview human resources

1154
00:46:33,331 --> 00:46:34,560
and pull you in the office.
Jim,

1155
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:39,090
I'm going to read from a transcript.
You tell me if this is not something

1156
00:46:39,091 --> 00:46:40,390
that you said.
Yeah.

1157
00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:44,640
Someone stuck their feet in my mouth
last night and they were clean but

1158
00:46:44,641 --> 00:46:45,450
stinky.
No,

1159
00:46:45,450 --> 00:46:48,300
that was awesome.
And I jerked off under my shirt.

1160
00:46:48,350 --> 00:46:51,360
It's not what I said.
I said she put them on my face and they

1161
00:46:51,361 --> 00:46:54,170
will clean but stinky none of them now.
I didn't suck them out.

1162
00:46:54,210 --> 00:46:55,900
I wanted to clean.
But you know,

1163
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:59,820
our job is we get to discuss anything
and it's so much fun to just vomit it

1164
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:02,190
and people,
people like it because they relate to

1165
00:47:02,191 --> 00:47:03,330
it,
but it's a.

1166
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:06,840
It could be a lot worse.
So I think it had a lot.

1167
00:47:06,841 --> 00:47:08,520
Like I have A.
I do have fun.

1168
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,950
I love doing the podcast.
Wouldn't bat.

1169
00:47:10,951 --> 00:47:13,140
I Love Matt Serra.
He's a fun guy.

1170
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:15,090
You know,
he's just the most genuine guy I've

1171
00:47:15,091 --> 00:47:17,790
probably known in years.
How often you guys do the UFC

1172
00:47:17,791 --> 00:47:18,650
uncensored,
right?

1173
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:20,760
How unfiltered you would do.
How many Tuesday?

1174
00:47:20,761 --> 00:47:21,451
Thursday,
Monday,

1175
00:47:21,451 --> 00:47:24,240
Wednesday with tape.
And it's just fun to sit with a guy.

1176
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:25,051
Monday,
Wednesday.

1177
00:47:25,051 --> 00:47:25,884
You tape?
What do you mean?

1178
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:29,140
We taped the day before it comes out for
whatever reason.

1179
00:47:29,141 --> 00:47:32,110
That's just the way they don't.
Just do it live.

1180
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:34,510
I don't know to be,
I will be happy to do it live.

1181
00:47:34,511 --> 00:47:37,660
But that was we though.
That was just a ufc his idea,

1182
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:40,020
you know,
I don't know who was damn.

1183
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:43,600
I'm guessing they the bosses,
so it's probably that more than digital,

1184
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:44,680
but I don't know.

1185
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:46,660
Who Do you talk to when you like when
you do that?

1186
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:49,460
If I have a problem or a question I'll
ask craig or I'll go to.

1187
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:52,870
I try not to bother Dana with stuff,
but if there's like a legit question

1188
00:47:52,871 --> 00:47:53,910
I'll have.
I'll ask Dana something.

1189
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,260
Who Do you coordinate with?
Like when you find out your schedule of

1190
00:47:56,261 --> 00:48:00,130
like who's going to be on the show?
We have a booker and I'll talk to our

1191
00:48:00,131 --> 00:48:04,150
producer who really is a great dude and
he's very organized and a great prep

1192
00:48:04,151 --> 00:48:05,560
guy.
Um,

1193
00:48:05,590 --> 00:48:06,880
but if there's something that I think
like,

1194
00:48:06,881 --> 00:48:08,470
Hey,
I would like to have this better,

1195
00:48:08,471 --> 00:48:11,590
or I would rather we should have this
guest on there in New York.

1196
00:48:11,970 --> 00:48:14,640
Then I'll maybe ask the UFC booker or
I'll ask.

1197
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:17,290
I'll ask Craig or somebody like that if
they can help.

1198
00:48:17,350 --> 00:48:21,130
And when someone comes up,
when you have an idea of a guest,

1199
00:48:21,131 --> 00:48:22,660
you can bring it up to them and they can
book it.

1200
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:23,501
Sure.
Yeah.

1201
00:48:23,501 --> 00:48:26,170
We just needed a booker and we have
someone now who is really helping out

1202
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:28,240
like I was.
Do you have to run it through like the

1203
00:48:28,241 --> 00:48:30,130
UFC,
like say if you wanted to have somebody

1204
00:48:30,131 --> 00:48:31,510
on.
Do you have to run it through anybody?

1205
00:48:31,670 --> 00:48:32,900
We keep the,
the,

1206
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:36,180
the producer,
Christopher Christopher Dosa know.

1207
00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:38,560
But he's like a guy who's.
He's a little nervous.

1208
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:39,780
Here's the one to get fired.
And I'm like,

1209
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,310
they're fine if we have a comedian on
her.

1210
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:43,990
I guess he likes to check it out.
I don't think we need to.

1211
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:45,470
Um,
but it does,

1212
00:48:45,570 --> 00:48:48,490
like I wanted Francis and God knew I
fucking love in God.

1213
00:48:48,491 --> 00:48:50,830
I just,
he's one of my favorite people and they

1214
00:48:50,831 --> 00:48:52,990
pitched him for our radio show in the
morning,

1215
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:55,180
but I was like,
we'll talk to them even though it's

1216
00:48:55,181 --> 00:48:56,950
gonna be hard because he,
well he speaks English.

1217
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:58,111
But um,
we,

1218
00:48:58,111 --> 00:49:01,420
we actually did the UFC podcast at
different day just so we could have him

1219
00:49:01,421 --> 00:49:02,890
in.
So he was great.

1220
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:04,680
That was it.
That's the fun part.

1221
00:49:04,690 --> 00:49:05,960
You can get people you want to talk
about.

1222
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:07,260
How bad is his English?
I mean,

1223
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,890
I've only talked to him post fight
interviews.

1224
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:10,960
He did not bring an interpreter with
them.

1225
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:13,510
Um,
could we did fade or twice years ago.

1226
00:49:13,511 --> 00:49:14,940
And that was rough going through a
woman,

1227
00:49:14,941 --> 00:49:15,700
you know,
Patrice was,

1228
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:18,820
and it was really a fun interview.
But yeah,

1229
00:49:18,821 --> 00:49:20,520
I don't think that's,
I don't know,

1230
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:24,430
that's not worth it now going through an
interpreter because you also don't know

1231
00:49:24,431 --> 00:49:26,170
whether or not with they're interpreting
accurately.

1232
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:29,350
Again,
I've had people say that I'm like,

1233
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:33,820
I'll interview someone after a fight and
then someone who actually speaks the

1234
00:49:33,821 --> 00:49:36,070
language,
we'll say that interpreter fucked up

1235
00:49:36,071 --> 00:49:36,940
everything.
Like they,

1236
00:49:36,941 --> 00:49:37,780
they got it all wrong.

1237
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,640
Oh,
that happens.

1238
00:49:40,090 --> 00:49:40,990
Yeah,
I guess so.

1239
00:49:40,991 --> 00:49:43,140
So we didn't want to do that,
but he didn't even bring.

1240
00:49:43,170 --> 00:49:45,130
He just brought someone with him.
He was nice.

1241
00:49:45,131 --> 00:49:46,590
He was like,
that was kind of fun.

1242
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:48,340
That guy's fucking scary.
He's scary,

1243
00:49:48,341 --> 00:49:49,174
man.
Fucking,

1244
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:51,340
I think here's the one that fight,
uh,

1245
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:53,800
I'm surprised he's number six over
Derrick Lewis,

1246
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:57,440
but it's in the neighborhood it me and
him and Derrick Lewis are definitely in

1247
00:49:57,441 --> 00:49:58,180
the neighborhood.
I would do.

1248
00:49:58,180 --> 00:50:01,480
I would give derek the nod because Derek
has been more top data.

1249
00:50:02,130 --> 00:50:05,290
He beat Roy Nelson.
You know Derek just be Travis Browne by

1250
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:06,760
Kao.
Big,

1251
00:50:06,761 --> 00:50:08,440
big victory for him.
Yeah,

1252
00:50:08,441 --> 00:50:09,880
I would.
I would rank their boy.

1253
00:50:09,881 --> 00:50:12,850
He's fun to listen to Derek Solera and
yeah,

1254
00:50:12,851 --> 00:50:13,690
he's a fun dude,
man.

1255
00:50:13,691 --> 00:50:15,460
He's fucking.
Instagram is hilarious.

1256
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:17,170
Yeah.
So much shit that he puts on instagram.

1257
00:50:17,171 --> 00:50:18,370
You're like,
oh my God.

1258
00:50:18,371 --> 00:50:20,560
Like this guy is pushing the envelope.

1259
00:50:20,590 --> 00:50:22,690
There's something about.
I don't know if it's because he did time

1260
00:50:22,691 --> 00:50:24,270
in jail,
but there's just something about that.

1261
00:50:24,290 --> 00:50:25,220
Just those guys like,
Oh,

1262
00:50:25,270 --> 00:50:27,950
I've seen such worst,
worst part of life.

1263
00:50:27,951 --> 00:50:30,270
This is just.
I can only guess what the.

1264
00:50:30,330 --> 00:50:32,600
But it seems like there's a different
mentality when you go to jail and come

1265
00:50:32,601 --> 00:50:33,990
out with.
Did Derek do time for.

1266
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:36,110
I don't remember.
It was a three and a half year.

1267
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:39,560
We talked to them about it,
but I don't know if we got into why he

1268
00:50:39,561 --> 00:50:41,180
was in jail.
Might've been a parole violation for

1269
00:50:41,181 --> 00:50:42,620
drugs.
He was just going down like a road.

1270
00:50:42,621 --> 00:50:43,830
I think three.
I don't know.

1271
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:45,590
I believe he did three and a half years.
Yeah,

1272
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:48,320
it's a long time.
He's an interesting guy.

1273
00:50:48,321 --> 00:50:52,100
He's getting a lot better man on a kid
is what he was saying in the beginning

1274
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:52,760
of his career.

1275
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:56,060
He was kind of a brawler and then
somewhere around the time when he fought

1276
00:50:56,061 --> 00:50:58,670
Roy Nelson,
I notice he's putting these combinations

1277
00:50:58,671 --> 00:51:02,150
together and he's got crazy endurance
and then I saw an interview with him

1278
00:51:02,151 --> 00:51:04,460
where he's talking about the strength
and conditioning workouts he's doing

1279
00:51:04,461 --> 00:51:05,500
now.
He realized like,

1280
00:51:05,570 --> 00:51:07,760
look,
I got to have a gas tank keys.

1281
00:51:07,830 --> 00:51:09,590
He could put it on these dudes that hit
him and hurt him.

1282
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,540
Then he'd run out of gas and you
realize,

1283
00:51:11,541 --> 00:51:13,640
yes,
I have a gas tank and now that he has

1284
00:51:13,641 --> 00:51:16,220
that gas tank,
you're seeing these incredible

1285
00:51:16,221 --> 00:51:19,100
performances for them because most guys
can keep you going through around if

1286
00:51:19,101 --> 00:51:20,690
they know that you might run out of
energy,

1287
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:22,700
they can.
At least they can keep you away for

1288
00:51:22,701 --> 00:51:24,350
enough time to fucking capitalize on
that.

1289
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:27,050
Travis Brown.
I was surprised that he lost that fight

1290
00:51:27,051 --> 00:51:28,040
because he was doing really well.

1291
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:29,240
Yeah.
And Travis had him hurt.

1292
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:31,100
Have you ever seen anybody?
I've never seen anybody hold their

1293
00:51:31,101 --> 00:51:33,270
stomach and like Derrick Lewis got
kicked in the stomach.

1294
00:51:33,271 --> 00:51:34,660
It was very funny condition.
He had to shit,

1295
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:37,280
but he got kicked and he actually turned
and ran two.

1296
00:51:37,281 --> 00:51:40,460
I've never seen anybody actually display
like,

1297
00:51:40,461 --> 00:51:41,810
fuck,
I don't want to get hit there again.

1298
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:43,400
I've seen it.
Yeah,

1299
00:51:43,430 --> 00:51:46,100
I've seen it map brownstone and a couple
of times he,

1300
00:51:46,101 --> 00:51:46,960
uh,
he talked to.

1301
00:51:47,130 --> 00:51:52,130
There was also a
drago pete sell fought nate quarry.

1302
00:51:55,690 --> 00:51:57,530
Is that who it was?
I think it was.

1303
00:51:58,550 --> 00:52:00,170
No.
Scott Smith.

1304
00:52:00,290 --> 00:52:01,520
Scott.
Yeah.

1305
00:52:01,521 --> 00:52:06,521
Scott hands of steel.
Smith and Drago hurt him to the body and

1306
00:52:07,371 --> 00:52:10,550
he moved in for the kill and Scott
knocked him out with one punch.

1307
00:52:10,730 --> 00:52:12,890
He came.
He came rushing in because Scott like

1308
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:15,950
grab his body and then as drago is
moving in,

1309
00:52:16,310 --> 00:52:19,280
Scott knocked him out with one punch and
then like literally filled the ground

1310
00:52:19,281 --> 00:52:20,450
himself in agony.

1311
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:23,090
Holding aside,
it's like one of those rich Franklin

1312
00:52:23,091 --> 00:52:25,530
ladelle things like,
like literally at the rounders entity.

1313
00:52:25,531 --> 00:52:27,380
Well I think he broke his arm and he
would have won the fight.

1314
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:30,230
You got to look back on that and go,
why didn't I just avoid that fucking?

1315
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:31,610
I was doing so good.
Well,

1316
00:52:31,611 --> 00:52:33,830
it's.
Chuck just had that crazy style.

1317
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:36,680
His style was always kamikaze.
It was killer be killed.

1318
00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:40,370
Just such a banana style.
So fun to watch,

1319
00:52:40,371 --> 00:52:42,430
but man,
that would never teach a fighter that

1320
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,510
you know,
you would never teach a guy to fight

1321
00:52:44,511 --> 00:52:46,030
like that.
You would teach a guy to fight and

1322
00:52:46,031 --> 00:52:47,360
mighty mouse style.
You'd never.

1323
00:52:47,361 --> 00:52:48,260
You'd never said,
hey,

1324
00:52:48,261 --> 00:52:50,540
fight like Chuck Odell.
I'd rather watch chuck fight.

1325
00:52:50,541 --> 00:52:53,630
Even though you know you by the masses,
like the guy is just a perfect,

1326
00:52:53,710 --> 00:52:54,543
you know,
but I just,

1327
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,580
you know,
I just like watching somebody throw

1328
00:52:56,630 --> 00:52:59,570
giant fists and fucking knocked people
out because that's what I want to be

1329
00:52:59,750 --> 00:52:59,900
like.

1330
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:03,200
If I could be a guy in life,
it's probably better off to be mighty

1331
00:53:03,201 --> 00:53:05,120
mouse.
He's probably a more responsible fellow.

1332
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:07,660
I'm probably a more polite fellow.
He probably,

1333
00:53:08,030 --> 00:53:09,020
but you know,
who do I want to be?

1334
00:53:09,021 --> 00:53:11,390
I would rather be Lidl.
Just the guy that walks in and he's

1335
00:53:11,391 --> 00:53:14,590
looking to fuck somebody or knock
somebody out and that's just a funny on

1336
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:16,700
his head.
Mohawk fucking animal.

1337
00:53:17,130 --> 00:53:20,420
Look in his eye.
You look at him and you know what he

1338
00:53:20,421 --> 00:53:22,370
does for a living?
Mighty mouse might be an accountant.

1339
00:53:22,371 --> 00:53:23,870
You don't know what he does for a,
but chuck,

1340
00:53:23,871 --> 00:53:25,890
you like,
he absolutely has to do this for living

1341
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:29,100
in the neighborhood.
He's a scary dude.

1342
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:32,580
He is.
But there's a lot of Improv.

1343
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:35,070
I didn't even know him that well years
ago in Dana brought him into the Improv

1344
00:53:35,071 --> 00:53:38,080
and he heckling me.
Always downstage being ah,

1345
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:42,310
what did you say?

1346
00:53:42,310 --> 00:53:44,970
I played with them a little bit because,
I mean we knew each other casually,

1347
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:45,930
but I was like,
what are you doing?

1348
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:47,270
Ladelle is heckling,
you know,

1349
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:50,730
because you never know how somebody is
really going to take,

1350
00:53:50,890 --> 00:53:53,410
you know,
when they're drinking a little more.

1351
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:56,880
Some people will have a bad reaction.
Don't want a bad reaction.

1352
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:57,840
No,
but he was the.

1353
00:53:57,841 --> 00:54:01,110
Afterwards we were chatting and I,
he's such an Alpha Guy,

1354
00:54:01,111 --> 00:54:02,700
like he doesn't even mean to do it.
You,

1355
00:54:02,701 --> 00:54:04,580
I was talking to him in the hallway and
he liked,

1356
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:06,270
he comes,
his arms are wide.

1357
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:07,520
He's like,
Nah,

1358
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:10,530
fuck.
It leans in anybody's being lovely.

1359
00:54:10,770 --> 00:54:14,130
But people walking by or like,
what the fuck is happening between the

1360
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:16,710
[inaudible]?
It looks like he's putting you down and

1361
00:54:16,711 --> 00:54:18,180
telling you to put it on your fucking
place,

1362
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,640
but he's not.
He's just having a fun chat.

1363
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,940
Lena gave with his giant Rv.
It's a really fun thing to watch.

1364
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:27,660
I could see people looking who they just
thought something unpleasant,

1365
00:54:27,661 --> 00:54:28,530
what's happening?
And I'm like,

1366
00:54:28,531 --> 00:54:30,390
no,
I'm just smiling bigger so they know I'm

1367
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:30,820
okay.
I'm like,

1368
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:32,760
ah,
just like when you see a big dog in the

1369
00:54:32,761 --> 00:54:33,594
room,
people just go,

1370
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:34,420
oh,
Jesus,

1371
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:35,120
is that dog?
If.

1372
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:37,050
Is that a friendly dog?
Who's dog is that?

1373
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:38,190
I want to take it,
man.

1374
00:54:38,191 --> 00:54:41,520
I listened to so many guys that do
Jujitsu and I want to do it so badly.

1375
00:54:41,550 --> 00:54:45,270
Want to do it because my cardio is so.
But Matt took me down to [inaudible] and

1376
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:46,620
I loved it.
I walked in,

1377
00:54:46,621 --> 00:54:47,850
I just,
I liked the atmosphere,

1378
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:49,400
but I've,
I've,

1379
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,390
uh,
I'm too tired and I know it sounds like

1380
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:52,710
such a pussy thing,
but I'm like,

1381
00:54:52,711 --> 00:54:55,950
I don't have apnea and I don't sleep and
I'm fucking exhausted all the time.

1382
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:58,410
But you just start doing it and you'll
get better.

1383
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:00,050
Yeah.
I make my all but I will

1384
00:55:00,070 --> 00:55:00,450
like,
you're,

1385
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:01,650
you're on a,
a,

1386
00:55:01,651 --> 00:55:04,540
a certain level in the beginning and
everybody's level is different.

1387
00:55:04,541 --> 00:55:07,480
If you came in,
you were like a world class gymnast and

1388
00:55:07,481 --> 00:55:08,830
you know,
you were really good at wrestling in

1389
00:55:08,831 --> 00:55:10,300
high school.
You'd be at a higher level when you

1390
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:13,570
started,
but everybody starts somewhere,

1391
00:55:13,590 --> 00:55:15,040
you know,
and you just keep getting better.

1392
00:55:15,041 --> 00:55:17,040
I mean bordain started at 58.

1393
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:17,991
I,
I actually,

1394
00:55:17,991 --> 00:55:20,000
you know,
it's funny I asked him because I know he

1395
00:55:20,001 --> 00:55:21,680
started like late and I'm like,
you like,

1396
00:55:21,681 --> 00:55:23,570
you fucking love it.
Like he's addicted to it,

1397
00:55:23,571 --> 00:55:26,150
so it makes me kind of want to.
He's a weird guy,

1398
00:55:26,151 --> 00:55:26,984
man.

1399
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:29,880
Never would have thought that when I
first met heroin addiction.

1400
00:55:29,970 --> 00:55:32,310
Well,
will the heroin addiction I think is

1401
00:55:32,311 --> 00:55:35,400
indicative of the same thing that's
leading him to Jitsu addiction.

1402
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:40,020
I think he's just a crazy impulsive guy
and not in a bad way.

1403
00:55:40,021 --> 00:55:42,630
I don't know.
It's not insulting way because that

1404
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:46,320
crazy impulsive thing.
It also doubles up as passion.

1405
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:48,750
You know,
like the way the guy loves food,

1406
00:55:48,810 --> 00:55:51,600
the way that guy loves culture,
the way the guy loves music,

1407
00:55:51,601 --> 00:55:53,910
the way the guy loves anything.
Man,

1408
00:55:53,911 --> 00:55:58,230
when he and I,
we did this episode of his show a few

1409
00:55:58,230 --> 00:56:00,780
months ago and we went pheasant hunting
and we talked to Jitsu.

1410
00:56:01,170 --> 00:56:02,640
He fucking loves it so much.
We were,

1411
00:56:02,770 --> 00:56:04,890
I,
we were down in the dirt,

1412
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:08,430
like on the ground in Montana and I was
going over positions,

1413
00:56:08,850 --> 00:56:10,950
like I was explaining certain parts of
this,

1414
00:56:10,951 --> 00:56:13,830
like a lot of times when guys are going
for the Darcy get stalled up here,

1415
00:56:13,831 --> 00:56:17,160
but here's another option and we were
going over stuff and like he was fucking

1416
00:56:17,161 --> 00:56:19,170
soaking it in man that,
you know,

1417
00:56:19,171 --> 00:56:22,770
there's guys that are like kind of like
to Jujitsu and then there's guys that I

1418
00:56:22,771 --> 00:56:24,010
started talking to my like,
oh,

1419
00:56:24,011 --> 00:56:25,240
this guy is balls deep.

1420
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:27,580
He's all in.
Well that's another reason I want to

1421
00:56:27,581 --> 00:56:30,520
take it because I a,
it's for self defense reasons and

1422
00:56:30,521 --> 00:56:33,010
because I talk about it with I want to
experience it.

1423
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:36,640
And there's also so many great people I
know that I could ask questions to.

1424
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:38,620
Oh yeah.
It's like almost like when you know all

1425
00:56:38,621 --> 00:56:41,020
these people who are great at it.
Well Matt Serra,

1426
00:56:41,070 --> 00:56:42,910
you know,
people don't give that guy the respect

1427
00:56:42,911 --> 00:56:45,040
he deserves.
I don't think people remember.

1428
00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:49,190
But at one point in time,
Matt was one of the Best Brazilian

1429
00:56:49,190 --> 00:56:50,540
Jujitsu competitors in the world.
Yeah,

1430
00:56:50,770 --> 00:56:53,380
he beat John Jacques Machado by
decision,

1431
00:56:53,381 --> 00:56:55,840
I mean it was by decision,
but he beat John when John Jacques was

1432
00:56:55,841 --> 00:57:00,040
in his prime when John Jack had one Abu
Dhabi and John Jack is submitting

1433
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:03,310
everybody submitted soccer.
I submitted like some of the best guys

1434
00:57:03,311 --> 00:57:04,660
in the world.
You know,

1435
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:07,210
Matt Serra was a fucking beast man.

1436
00:57:07,570 --> 00:57:09,700
He was one of those first black belts in
America.

1437
00:57:10,450 --> 00:57:11,680
Yeah,
I mean he's,

1438
00:57:11,710 --> 00:57:15,910
he was super respected as the Jujitsu
competitor before he ever got into the

1439
00:57:15,911 --> 00:57:17,540
UFC.
And you know,

1440
00:57:17,890 --> 00:57:18,880
the problem,
Matt,

1441
00:57:18,970 --> 00:57:22,720
in some ways it's kind of cursed with
the fact that he has heavy hands.

1442
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:25,100
He hits really hard.
So Matt Wind Up,

1443
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:26,540
you know,
knocking a lot of guys out,

1444
00:57:26,790 --> 00:57:28,060
knocked out.
GSP,

1445
00:57:28,090 --> 00:57:32,040
knocked out frank trigg,
but maths Jujitsu was better than like

1446
00:57:32,110 --> 00:57:34,990
99 percent of the people that have ever
competed in mma.

1447
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:39,640
He loves it so much fun to will you talk
to him and he talks about he has to roll

1448
00:57:39,641 --> 00:57:41,620
in that like he just,
he loves it so much.

1449
00:57:41,621 --> 00:57:43,720
It makes you want to do it well for him.
It's fun.

1450
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:45,340
He's strangling people every day.
Yeah,

1451
00:57:45,341 --> 00:57:46,960
that would be fun.
He's not the nail,

1452
00:57:46,961 --> 00:57:47,940
he's the fucking hammered.

1453
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:49,450
I,
I would probably be in a much different

1454
00:57:49,451 --> 00:57:51,100
position.
I probably have a much different feeling

1455
00:57:51,101 --> 00:57:54,190
about it.
I would be definitely it would at first,

1456
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:56,200
but it's just one of those things where
the first,

1457
00:57:56,201 --> 00:57:58,660
the moment you get your first tap out,
you'll be so addicted.

1458
00:57:58,690 --> 00:58:00,040
It's so fun.
Yeah.

1459
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:01,420
But you do,
you immediately start.

1460
00:58:01,421 --> 00:58:01,800
Like,
I,

1461
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:05,560
I'm such a fucking complaining,
but like I tendinitis and like I

1462
00:58:05,561 --> 00:58:07,510
couldn't work out for a year.
I could only do legs and,

1463
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:10,000
and cardio.
So I had this terrible was wrong with

1464
00:58:10,001 --> 00:58:10,401
your,
uh,

1465
00:58:10,401 --> 00:58:12,350
I had tendonitis and it was like
literally I can't,

1466
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:14,800
I think if I'm doing pull ups or doing
the kettlebells wrong.

1467
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,690
Um,
and uh,

1468
00:58:16,691 --> 00:58:17,560
I just,
I literally,

1469
00:58:17,561 --> 00:58:20,270
my arm was in such pain.
I couldn't do anything with my arms for

1470
00:58:20,271 --> 00:58:21,940
a year.
That was when I lost all that weight.

1471
00:58:22,210 --> 00:58:23,080
I was fucked up.

1472
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:24,550
I was like,
I'm never going to get fat again.

1473
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:26,950
And I went on this whole 30 diet and it
was,

1474
00:58:27,010 --> 00:58:29,020
I stuck to it for like eight months.
What's a,

1475
00:58:29,021 --> 00:58:30,610
what's a whole $30?
Pretty good.

1476
00:58:30,611 --> 00:58:32,240
It was like you don't feel like you're
eating unhealthy.

1477
00:58:32,330 --> 00:58:36,490
A lot of egg whites and common sense
with carbs and you get a baked potato

1478
00:58:36,491 --> 00:58:37,370
and some fruit.
Like they.

1479
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:38,640
They didn't say don't eat this,
don't.

1480
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:41,110
It was just very strict.
Certain nuts,

1481
00:58:41,111 --> 00:58:45,310
no beans on this shit and I dropped a
ton of late and I was doing all cardio

1482
00:58:45,311 --> 00:58:48,470
and I'm just afraid of reinjuring my
alarm and not being able to work out

1483
00:58:48,550 --> 00:58:51,190
like you can't think like that if your
arm's not hurt your arms on hurt.

1484
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:52,900
One of the things that happens when you
get injured,

1485
00:58:52,901 --> 00:58:54,820
you think you start thinking of your
body's like a race car.

1486
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:55,990
Like you blow a tire.
Like,

1487
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,050
oh well I'll go get that tire fixed.
You know,

1488
00:58:58,051 --> 00:59:02,110
like I've had A.
I've had quite a few surgeries and a

1489
00:59:02,111 --> 00:59:04,080
bunch of injuries that I didn't have to
get surgery on it.

1490
00:59:04,081 --> 00:59:07,120
I just had to let them heal up.
But you just do.

1491
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:10,750
It's so fun that you just sort of have a
different way of looking at your body.

1492
00:59:10,751 --> 00:59:15,751
You start thinking of your body is like
a utensil or a tool instead of just as

1493
00:59:16,061 --> 00:59:18,160
your body.
I mean you think of it as your body as

1494
00:59:18,161 --> 00:59:20,080
well,
but like if I break something,

1495
00:59:20,081 --> 00:59:21,420
I heard something like,
fuck,

1496
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:23,330
I got to fix this thing.
I don't think of as like,

1497
00:59:23,331 --> 00:59:26,570
oh my God,
I can't do this again because if I get

1498
00:59:26,571 --> 00:59:30,230
more tendinitis on this elbow then my
elbow will always be in pain.

1499
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:31,513
I don't think like that.

1500
00:59:31,580 --> 00:59:32,960
I think,
how do I fix this thing?

1501
00:59:33,350 --> 00:59:35,060
Where do I got to go?
Who's the doctor?

1502
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:38,630
Luckily I worked for the UFC,
so I'll talk to Dr Davidson and I'll

1503
00:59:38,631 --> 00:59:39,350
say,
hey man,

1504
00:59:39,350 --> 00:59:40,860
what can we do about this?
Like what?

1505
00:59:40,861 --> 00:59:42,470
What do you,
what do you recommend?

1506
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:43,360
And he'll say,
well,

1507
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:46,970
he and he's on the cutting edge and
excuse me,

1508
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:51,350
he's actually,
I'm part of this team that has started

1509
00:59:51,351 --> 00:59:56,300
injecting stem cells into disks,
which is this radical new procedure

1510
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:59,660
where they've been using stem cells to
regenerate tissue for a long time and

1511
00:59:59,661 --> 01:00:02,210
stem cells work amazing by the way,
on tendinitis.

1512
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:05,480
Really fuck yet heals it up like it's
incredible.

1513
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:07,550
I did cortisol,
which I know is not recommended.

1514
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:11,030
I did it once and someone told me just
do it once and you're okay,

1515
01:00:11,031 --> 01:00:13,070
but don't keep doing it.
I did it once and it actually really

1516
01:00:13,071 --> 01:00:14,330
helped and I didn't do anything.

1517
01:00:14,370 --> 01:00:15,720
It actually fixed me a little bit.
Oh,

1518
01:00:15,721 --> 01:00:16,371
that's good.
Well,

1519
01:00:16,371 --> 01:00:18,140
it certainly will help take away some of
the pain,

1520
01:00:18,141 --> 01:00:21,710
but it's dangerous because it masks that
pain and then a lot of times guys like

1521
01:00:21,740 --> 01:00:24,740
they,
they injure themselves badly because

1522
01:00:24,741 --> 01:00:26,450
they don't feel that pain.
Like Bas rutten,

1523
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:30,350
bas rutten chewed his fucking needs to
pieces because he got cortisone shots

1524
01:00:30,351 --> 01:00:31,880
and um,
when they were already damaged and just

1525
01:00:31,881 --> 01:00:33,920
push through it like an animal,
you know.

1526
01:00:33,921 --> 01:00:38,120
But my point is like,
what they're able to do now is they can

1527
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:40,760
shoot these stem cells.
They take fetal stem cells,

1528
01:00:40,761 --> 01:00:43,190
they get from a woman's placenta after
she gives birth,

1529
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:46,220
she,
they'd take like a woman who gives birth

1530
01:00:46,221 --> 01:00:48,740
by Sicilian section.
They take out the placenta,

1531
01:00:48,890 --> 01:00:52,850
the extract stem cells from this
placenta and then inject them directly

1532
01:00:52,851 --> 01:00:54,710
and injuries you fucking heel.
It's,

1533
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:57,380
it regenerates tissue,
regenerates Meniscus,

1534
01:00:57,590 --> 01:00:58,130
regenerates.

1535
01:00:58,130 --> 01:01:01,640
All these different types of tissue can
basically form anything that's injured,

1536
01:01:01,730 --> 01:01:03,230
soft tissue,
muscle,

1537
01:01:03,290 --> 01:01:04,580
any,
any tendons,

1538
01:01:04,790 --> 01:01:06,500
anything that's injured,
it can regenerate,

1539
01:01:06,710 --> 01:01:10,400
but they're now doing it on discs,
which is crazy because when you have

1540
01:01:10,580 --> 01:01:13,730
disc degeneration,
what happens is your body through poor

1541
01:01:13,731 --> 01:01:15,140
posture,
exercise,

1542
01:01:15,141 --> 01:01:16,130
abuse,
trauma,

1543
01:01:16,131 --> 01:01:20,330
whatever your disks get compressed,
they still wind up pushing on your

1544
01:01:20,331 --> 01:01:23,930
nerves and they usually do what's called
a disectomy will they come in and they

1545
01:01:23,931 --> 01:01:27,380
cut a piece of the disc away.
Usually it gets worse and some people

1546
01:01:27,381 --> 01:01:30,240
either have to get that disc removed and
then they,

1547
01:01:30,250 --> 01:01:33,820
they get it replaced with an artificial
one like Eddie Bravo got it replaced

1548
01:01:33,821 --> 01:01:37,190
with an artificial one,
or they will actually fuse the bone

1549
01:01:37,191 --> 01:01:39,040
together,
which is very problematic.

1550
01:01:39,041 --> 01:01:41,780
It puts stress on the upper and the
lower portion of the disc.

1551
01:01:42,020 --> 01:01:45,650
Now what they're going to do,
it started injecting stem cells directly

1552
01:01:45,651 --> 01:01:48,920
into the disc and the disc will
regenerate and pump up.

1553
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:51,590
So you'll be able to,
in theory,

1554
01:01:51,591 --> 01:01:54,650
at least get your disks back to where
they were when you were 18.

1555
01:01:54,830 --> 01:01:55,663
So you.
So,

1556
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:57,910
uh,
a little injection of stem cells into

1557
01:01:58,820 --> 01:02:00,380
fuck it,
but it's not hurting him now,

1558
01:02:00,381 --> 01:02:01,010
right?
No,

1559
01:02:01,010 --> 01:02:02,870
I used to,
but I noticed that when I do certain

1560
01:02:02,871 --> 01:02:05,120
things like I,
it's almost like I feel like all that

1561
01:02:05,121 --> 01:02:05,990
guy,
hey,

1562
01:02:06,350 --> 01:02:08,210
like it's,
it's just the beginning of it and I know

1563
01:02:08,211 --> 01:02:10,820
what we're going to lift weights.
I do,

1564
01:02:10,850 --> 01:02:11,990
but not a lot.
Yeah.

1565
01:02:11,991 --> 01:02:14,720
But I mean you don't have to do a lot,
but just lift weights and you know,

1566
01:02:14,721 --> 01:02:17,600
progressively build it up and listened
to it,

1567
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:20,130
you know,
if you feel put some ice on

1568
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:21,250
it,
but bill,

1569
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:23,580
late weightlifting,
like it seems,

1570
01:02:24,020 --> 01:02:27,090
it seems counterintuitive,
but one of the things that a lot of

1571
01:02:27,091 --> 01:02:28,960
people have found is that even Olympic
lifting,

1572
01:02:28,961 --> 01:02:33,060
like heavy power lifting cleans and
squats and dead lifts and things along

1573
01:02:33,061 --> 01:02:37,350
those lines actually helps joint pain
because it strengthens up all that

1574
01:02:37,351 --> 01:02:40,200
tissue and strengthens up all the
stabilizing muscles.

1575
01:02:40,410 --> 01:02:42,540
Strengthens up all the ligaments and
tendons.

1576
01:02:42,750 --> 01:02:43,441
Yeah,
I do lyft,

1577
01:02:43,441 --> 01:02:45,120
but it's not a lot,
but I can't do much.

1578
01:02:45,121 --> 01:02:48,420
I get to tuckered out.
You can talk her down like training with

1579
01:02:48,421 --> 01:02:50,250
the fucking spit on me.
I'm always like,

1580
01:02:50,251 --> 01:02:51,370
I'm tired.
I'll walk in,

1581
01:02:51,371 --> 01:02:52,560
I'll let her know what kind of shape I'm
in.

1582
01:02:52,561 --> 01:02:54,690
Like I'm really honest about it.
Like if I feel okay,

1583
01:02:54,990 --> 01:02:57,180
but if I'm having my days where I'm
feeling like stoned,

1584
01:02:57,220 --> 01:02:58,440
who just got to deal with it?
Yeah.

1585
01:02:58,470 --> 01:02:59,350
I push through.

1586
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:00,273
Yeah.
I do.

1587
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:03,240
Me and you and I should do a show where
I take you to the fucking gym every day

1588
01:03:03,241 --> 01:03:06,810
and we just get crazy.
I would like to caffeine and I would try

1589
01:03:06,811 --> 01:03:08,090
that.
Yeah.

1590
01:03:08,690 --> 01:03:12,000
One of these caveman coffees,
these fuckers have 270 milligrams of

1591
01:03:12,001 --> 01:03:15,150
caffeine.
I'll give you two of these bitches and

1592
01:03:15,151 --> 01:03:15,984
then some,
uh,

1593
01:03:15,990 --> 01:03:20,010
some Alpha brain and some shroom tech
sport and just going there like a

1594
01:03:20,070 --> 01:03:23,040
Goddamn wildman and being some hot pink
satin shorts.

1595
01:03:23,041 --> 01:03:25,680
And let me look that scrunchy socks like
from a.

1596
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:29,460
What was that movie?
She's a maniac.

1597
01:03:29,980 --> 01:03:32,610
All a dance.
Dance,

1598
01:03:32,940 --> 01:03:36,810
dance fast dance class that I always
hated.

1599
01:03:36,811 --> 01:03:39,990
That part I saw that goes in and it
goes.

1600
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:42,240
My fucking hated.
That part bothers you?

1601
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:43,133
Yeah,
I hated it.

1602
01:03:43,290 --> 01:03:45,960
I don't know why there's certain things
like certain songs with a,

1603
01:03:45,961 --> 01:03:46,794
with a,
uh,

1604
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:47,910
with a clap in it.

1605
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:50,980
Like on the big Bette Davis Eyes Guy.
I liked that

1606
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:57,130
she's got bad days,
but I hate with a guy that,

1607
01:03:57,190 --> 01:03:57,591
that,
that,

1608
01:03:57,591 --> 01:03:58,000
that,
that,

1609
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,490
that,
that was so eighties.

1610
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:03,600
The fucking,
the handclaps in songs drove me crazy.

1611
01:04:03,601 --> 01:04:04,590
I hated that.
Yeah.

1612
01:04:04,890 --> 01:04:08,490
It is funny how songs like you can tell
they're from a time,

1613
01:04:09,270 --> 01:04:09,781
you know,
like there,

1614
01:04:09,781 --> 01:04:11,640
there's a sound to them.
They'd go,

1615
01:04:11,670 --> 01:04:13,500
Oh yeah,
that's from that time.

1616
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:16,740
Especially like 60 to 60,
like that weird.

1617
01:04:16,741 --> 01:04:19,770
Whatever the weird sound,
whether it's what Phil Spector started

1618
01:04:20,070 --> 01:04:23,670
or these other things that like when you
have been listening to del Shannon's

1619
01:04:23,671 --> 01:04:26,500
runaway a lot and there's just a sound
in there,

1620
01:04:26,510 --> 01:04:30,180
but I don't let that.
Then you just like everyone who that

1621
01:04:30,181 --> 01:04:34,410
song meant something to as a teenager is
old or dead were songs give me weird

1622
01:04:34,411 --> 01:04:36,090
feelings man.
I listened to the sixties and the

1623
01:04:36,091 --> 01:04:40,950
fifties and I,
I feel like creepily voyeuristic and

1624
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:43,500
frightened,
like I really get weird listening to

1625
01:04:43,501 --> 01:04:46,950
those old songs because the connection
they had,

1626
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:48,330
they are in history.

1627
01:04:48,330 --> 01:04:49,163
It's gone,
it's dead.

1628
01:04:49,650 --> 01:04:50,790
It really freaks me out.
Well,

1629
01:04:50,791 --> 01:04:54,240
it's also one of the first times.
I mean if you really go back to it,

1630
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:58,010
but I get creeped out when I listened to
early 19 hundreds music too,

1631
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:01,470
because that's the original music that
was recorded essentially.

1632
01:05:01,471 --> 01:05:03,000
I mean,
I think the first.

1633
01:05:03,030 --> 01:05:06,030
We talked about this once before,
when was the first record?

1634
01:05:06,210 --> 01:05:08,000
I feel like it was the late.
No,

1635
01:05:08,010 --> 01:05:11,370
it was like the 17 hundreds.
The first time they came up with one of

1636
01:05:11,371 --> 01:05:12,810
those big,
you know,

1637
01:05:12,811 --> 01:05:16,710
those big tubes with like the needle on
it and that that was where the sound

1638
01:05:16,711 --> 01:05:21,160
came from was that giant thing.
It's not people in fucking in Brooklyn

1639
01:05:21,161 --> 01:05:23,050
or buying them because they think it
makes them look really cool.

1640
01:05:23,410 --> 01:05:25,890
Williamsburg,
getting those things and listening to

1641
01:05:25,910 --> 01:05:28,660
old vinyl on it sounds like shit.
I put final.

1642
01:05:29,110 --> 01:05:32,950
What is this then?
The records first.

1643
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:34,033
Oh,
that's right.

1644
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:35,560
Yeah.
The cylinder.

1645
01:05:35,561 --> 01:05:36,520
That's right,
yeah.

1646
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:39,880
Yeah.
It's just crazy that when you think

1647
01:05:39,881 --> 01:05:42,460
about human history that people recorded
music,

1648
01:05:42,461 --> 01:05:46,000
they just had,
they could only write things down until,

1649
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:48,640
you know,
a little bit more than 150 years ago or

1650
01:05:48,641 --> 01:05:50,140
150 years ago.
Whatever it was.

1651
01:05:50,260 --> 01:05:52,670
It is weird when you look like when
you're listening to you.

1652
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:53,351
Yeah.
I follow.

1653
01:05:53,351 --> 01:05:54,730
You want to hear something like,
ah,

1654
01:05:54,830 --> 01:05:57,490
Tom Petty and you just download it like
a walk into a club,

1655
01:05:57,530 --> 01:05:59,920
Lee.
And the idea that people couldn't record

1656
01:05:59,921 --> 01:06:01,660
it at one time.
Like you literally had to just say none

1657
01:06:01,661 --> 01:06:02,520
of that song.
No.

1658
01:06:02,810 --> 01:06:03,380
Uh,
and then,

1659
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:06,790
and tell somebody how to play it and
they had to hear it and then they had to

1660
01:06:06,791 --> 01:06:09,310
play it the way you play.
That's how it got passed down.

1661
01:06:09,370 --> 01:06:12,500
The worst is when someone,
you tell someone like,

1662
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:13,630
Hey,
you know that song,

1663
01:06:13,750 --> 01:06:14,583
and then you go,
ah,

1664
01:06:14,610 --> 01:06:15,610
it's like this,
like,

1665
01:06:15,620 --> 01:06:17,440
hey,
been diag.

1666
01:06:17,450 --> 01:06:19,390
Sam fairies,
Sammy.

1667
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:21,430
Where his sanity,
like I don't know what the fuck you're

1668
01:06:21,431 --> 01:06:23,890
telling me.
And then you play the song and they go,

1669
01:06:23,891 --> 01:06:24,890
oh,
that song.

1670
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:26,350
Oh my God,
you weren't,

1671
01:06:26,380 --> 01:06:28,280
you didn't sound anything like that
song.

1672
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:29,730
I was trying my best.
Yeah,

1673
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:31,480
that was,
that was not completely unfamiliar

1674
01:06:31,481 --> 01:06:34,960
sound.
You are making love to change.

1675
01:06:35,170 --> 01:06:36,880
Well,
I don't know that one,

1676
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,180
but I don't know what to do.
I bet you would.

1677
01:06:40,181 --> 01:06:42,970
If you heard it.
I probably would like really weird

1678
01:06:42,971 --> 01:06:44,950
sapping music sometimes.
Like I get really.

1679
01:06:44,980 --> 01:06:48,580
I'm a weird emotional wreck with stuff.
Yeah.

1680
01:06:48,650 --> 01:06:49,930
Yeah.
I cry a weird shit.

1681
01:06:50,190 --> 01:06:52,300
I'm like sad.
I cried at Logan.

1682
01:06:52,301 --> 01:06:53,760
I like to try it.
Yeah.

1683
01:06:53,761 --> 01:06:55,090
Yeah.
I like to find movies.

1684
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:59,050
It makes me feel like connected to
things like,

1685
01:06:59,051 --> 01:07:00,370
you know,
like a jungle fever.

1686
01:07:02,650 --> 01:07:04,270
Frank Vincent.
I just wanted to hug him.

1687
01:07:04,271 --> 01:07:06,140
I get it now,
but I to it.

1688
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:09,060
That makes me feel like I'm not
disconnected from human interactions or

1689
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:13,110
do you feel sometimes like you are just
a little bit but not.

1690
01:07:13,111 --> 01:07:16,660
Not to a point where I think I'm unique
but just sometimes a little bit like

1691
01:07:16,661 --> 01:07:19,900
it's always one tick off.
Like I would argue with a woman in a

1692
01:07:19,901 --> 01:07:24,070
relationship and I could say barbaric
things because I felt like I was arguing

1693
01:07:24,071 --> 01:07:26,020
through a window,
like it was not real life.

1694
01:07:26,021 --> 01:07:28,240
It was a movie,
like it was a movie performance,

1695
01:07:28,510 --> 01:07:32,290
but then I watched a Sanka commercial.
Oh you hugged the puppy and I'm crying

1696
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:35,770
and it was like,
it was like one click off from where you

1697
01:07:35,771 --> 01:07:37,220
should be.
I,

1698
01:07:37,710 --> 01:07:40,870
I can remember Bill Burr,
I've been thinking of a lot because bill

1699
01:07:40,871 --> 01:07:44,680
bill told me that he doesn't call names,
like he won't call his wife a bitch.

1700
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:48,260
He just doesn't do it because he saw
that growing up and he was as angry as

1701
01:07:48,370 --> 01:07:51,130
can be.
He doesn't name call and to thinking

1702
01:07:51,131 --> 01:07:51,900
about that a lot,
I'm like,

1703
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:55,460
I haven't done that with every person I
dated and it's so fucked up cause yeah,

1704
01:07:55,570 --> 01:07:56,800
it just happens.
They'll say,

1705
01:07:56,801 --> 01:07:59,050
shut up here and I'll be like,
you fucking of like,

1706
01:07:59,140 --> 01:08:01,290
I don't want to do that anymore.
It's just kind of made me feel like a

1707
01:08:01,780 --> 01:08:03,400
shitty.
It's Shitty.

1708
01:08:03,550 --> 01:08:05,920
It is shitty and it's too easy to do.
Especially,

1709
01:08:06,190 --> 01:08:09,280
there's a real issue when you do it
because you know the person's going to

1710
01:08:09,281 --> 01:08:11,140
take it.
You know what I mean?

1711
01:08:11,410 --> 01:08:12,640
Like it's one thing if you're like,
look,

1712
01:08:12,641 --> 01:08:13,940
you're a continent.
This is done.

1713
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:15,590
I can't do this anymore.
You fucking,

1714
01:08:15,591 --> 01:08:16,160
you left my house

1715
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:17,240
on fire.
You Fuck my brother.

1716
01:08:17,270 --> 01:08:20,110
It's all absolutely after I jerk off to
the memories on that.

1717
01:08:22,580 --> 01:08:26,900
But there's one thing if you say
something to someone knowing that you're

1718
01:08:26,901 --> 01:08:29,510
going to make up,
like knowing that you can get away with

1719
01:08:29,511 --> 01:08:30,000
it.
You know,

1720
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,850
I think a lot of people do that in
relationships.

1721
01:08:31,851 --> 01:08:34,340
They get real mean and nasty to each
other because they know the person's

1722
01:08:34,341 --> 01:08:35,930
trapped.
Especially if you're married and you

1723
01:08:35,931 --> 01:08:36,450
have kids.
Right,

1724
01:08:36,450 --> 01:08:37,040
right,
right.

1725
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:38,420
That can get real squirrely.
I've seen,

1726
01:08:38,421 --> 01:08:40,820
I've seen,
I've seen that happen with people and

1727
01:08:40,821 --> 01:08:41,660
you're like,
cool man,

1728
01:08:41,661 --> 01:08:44,360
you got to not do that to each other.
It makes me not want to get married.

1729
01:08:44,361 --> 01:08:48,080
Can I talked to so many guys who don't
get their dick sucked anymore and they

1730
01:08:48,140 --> 01:08:49,520
don't get this or that,
and I'm like,

1731
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:51,260
I'm not that.
It's got to be a fuck fest if you're

1732
01:08:51,261 --> 01:08:52,040
married,
I get it.

1733
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:53,050
You know the kid things.
Dialogue,

1734
01:08:53,410 --> 01:08:56,180
but that's my fear is I married
somebody.

1735
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:57,560
A real fear.
Yeah.

1736
01:08:57,561 --> 01:08:59,300
All these things.
All of a sudden I know I'm going to

1737
01:08:59,301 --> 01:09:00,860
cheat.
I'm not going to be good.

1738
01:09:01,190 --> 01:09:05,420
Well,
it's a the the idea of marriage and this

1739
01:09:05,421 --> 01:09:08,270
is coming from a happily married guy.
It's fucking stupid.

1740
01:09:08,330 --> 01:09:09,500
Yeah,
and this is why,

1741
01:09:09,710 --> 01:09:14,240
because it's a contract.
You're your people change on a day to

1742
01:09:14,241 --> 01:09:16,220
day basis.
They change throughout the day.

1743
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:21,140
They change based on the song they hear,
they change based on the conversation

1744
01:09:21,141 --> 01:09:24,470
they have with their girlfriend.
They change based on a book they read.

1745
01:09:24,471 --> 01:09:28,520
People fucking change and you're,
you're in this constant stage of growing

1746
01:09:28,521 --> 01:09:31,250
and developing and when you commit to
someone like you say,

1747
01:09:31,251 --> 01:09:32,360
like,
this is my girlfriend,

1748
01:09:32,361 --> 01:09:33,590
this is my husband,
this is my wife,

1749
01:09:33,591 --> 01:09:35,540
this is my,
this is my companion.

1750
01:09:35,810 --> 01:09:40,580
When you do that,
there's one thing to do it and to really

1751
01:09:40,581 --> 01:09:43,850
be all in and really enjoy that person's
company and want to be with them a lot.

1752
01:09:43,970 --> 01:09:48,970
So nothing to involve the government to
get legal paperwork signed and all that

1753
01:09:49,341 --> 01:09:51,910
kind of.
I was willing to do it simply because,

1754
01:09:51,950 --> 01:09:52,641
well,
first of all,

1755
01:09:52,641 --> 01:09:55,220
because my wife's awesome and I love her
and she's a great person,

1756
01:09:55,490 --> 01:09:57,830
but also because I have children and I
was like,

1757
01:09:57,831 --> 01:10:00,290
well,
that having children is a way bigger

1758
01:10:00,291 --> 01:10:03,650
commitment than anything else.
It's because now there's a human life

1759
01:10:03,651 --> 01:10:08,651
that depends on you and all my phobias
about government interaction and laws

1760
01:10:08,841 --> 01:10:11,360
and legal paperwork.
And this is coming from a guy who has

1761
01:10:11,450 --> 01:10:16,040
several close friends whose lives have
been fucking ruined by divorce,

1762
01:10:17,190 --> 01:10:20,000
where they've had to pay exorbitant
amounts of money.

1763
01:10:20,001 --> 01:10:21,920
It wrecks their life.
It caused them stress.

1764
01:10:21,921 --> 01:10:24,590
They've aged 10 years in a year.
I've seen guys like that.

1765
01:10:24,740 --> 01:10:28,120
I seen a bunch of guys like that who
have been devastated by divorce and and

1766
01:10:28,121 --> 01:10:30,110
then then devastated by the fucking
wife.

1767
01:10:30,110 --> 01:10:34,640
Hiring the most evil vicious lawyers to
attack them and go after them and try to

1768
01:10:34,990 --> 01:10:38,690
squeeze as much money out as possible
and drag it into the dirt.

1769
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:43,640
Especially when a man and woman who are
married and the man makes all the money,

1770
01:10:43,641 --> 01:10:47,120
the man has to pay for the woman's
lawyer and that's where things get

1771
01:10:47,121 --> 01:10:49,290
fucking ridiculous.
Yeah.

1772
01:10:49,300 --> 01:10:51,410
Because then there's no cost to her to
do anything.

1773
01:10:51,411 --> 01:10:54,380
She can file a motion after motion
knowing this dummy is paying for it.

1774
01:10:54,450 --> 01:10:56,150
Not only that,
she's draining the money.

1775
01:10:56,180 --> 01:10:59,930
She's draining his money and I had a
very good friend of mine deal with this.

1776
01:11:00,170 --> 01:11:03,540
He went through,
it was more than a year and a half of of

1777
01:11:03,650 --> 01:11:07,490
deliberate where he lost hundreds of
thousands of dollars in legal fees and

1778
01:11:07,491 --> 01:11:09,200
the whole time his wife was doing it on
purpose.

1779
01:11:09,230 --> 01:11:11,930
They would come to an agreement and then
she would change the agreement should be

1780
01:11:11,931 --> 01:11:12,620
like,
I don't give a fuck.

1781
01:11:12,620 --> 01:11:13,980
I want more.
And he would be like,

1782
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:14,880
well,
we had an agreement.

1783
01:11:14,881 --> 01:11:15,870
She's like,
fuck you,

1784
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:18,990
fuck you pay me.
And then she would hang up the phone and

1785
01:11:18,991 --> 01:11:21,660
then the lawyer would contact.
These are the new stipulations and he

1786
01:11:21,661 --> 01:11:24,810
would get ready to agree to those and
then she would drag that out for a

1787
01:11:24,810 --> 01:11:27,120
couple months and then ramp it up again
and she was being completely

1788
01:11:27,121 --> 01:11:29,700
unreasonable and it hit on the
relationship too.

1789
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:32,790
That's a weird relationship.
Even when it's a hateful relationship,

1790
01:11:32,791 --> 01:11:34,720
it's still some kind of a connection.
Yeah,

1791
01:11:34,980 --> 01:11:36,490
it's crazy.
What people divorce.

1792
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:40,690
Do I have to Piss my pants because I
couldn't make it through a whole podcast

1793
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:41,520
on it,
buddy.

1794
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:42,990
Don't worry about it.
I'm glad you did.

1795
01:11:42,991 --> 01:11:44,490
Well,
I was getting too wrapped up about

1796
01:11:44,491 --> 01:11:48,360
divorce talk.
He's crazy to think he's going to get

1797
01:11:48,361 --> 01:11:51,740
married.
When you talk to someone who is a,

1798
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:55,140
and I say this with all due respect,
the hardcore pervert like Jim Norton,

1799
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:57,840
the ideally is going to settle down,
but you know what it is,

1800
01:11:57,841 --> 01:11:58,560
man.

1801
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:01,380
When you don't have it,
it seems so attractive to you.

1802
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:02,610
You know,
like if,

1803
01:12:02,630 --> 01:12:06,420
if.
If you're a guy who's got a regular nine

1804
01:12:06,421 --> 01:12:08,250
to five job,
you get up in the morning,

1805
01:12:08,251 --> 01:12:10,170
you get your newspaper,
you let the dog out,

1806
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:12,480
you say hi to your kids,
you eat your breakfast,

1807
01:12:12,481 --> 01:12:14,860
you drink your coffee,
you go to work the same way every day,

1808
01:12:15,150 --> 01:12:18,180
and then you hear about rsg.
Fear disappeared and thrown his phone

1809
01:12:18,181 --> 01:12:23,181
into the garbage and just traveling to
the middle of God knows where the fuck

1810
01:12:23,371 --> 01:12:24,720
he is.
We think he's in Vietnam.

1811
01:12:24,721 --> 01:12:27,510
That's what we've heard,
but he could have left Vietnam Tuesday

1812
01:12:27,511 --> 01:12:30,750
and gotten a fucking Malaysia now and
who knows where he is.

1813
01:12:30,751 --> 01:12:32,280
It might be in Bali,
he might.

1814
01:12:32,310 --> 01:12:36,660
He might be doing some fucking
psychedelic ritual with some monks and

1815
01:12:36,661 --> 01:12:39,780
the top of a temple right now who knows
conflict three months.

1816
01:12:40,180 --> 01:12:41,400
Yeah,
that's insane.

1817
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:42,510
It's great.
It's awesome,

1818
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:44,970
but I don't want to do it.
I mean,

1819
01:12:44,971 --> 01:12:49,080
but to someone who looks at light,
like if I was miserable and I looked at

1820
01:12:49,081 --> 01:12:50,310
his life and be like,
God damn,

1821
01:12:50,311 --> 01:12:52,410
that's what I want to do.
That's what I want to do.

1822
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:56,160
So I think when people just aren't
completely comfortable with their life,

1823
01:12:56,400 --> 01:13:00,630
Jim's problem and one of Jim's problems
is he's very smart and when he's

1824
01:13:00,690 --> 01:13:04,200
thinking he's constantly thinking,
so he's constantly obsessing about

1825
01:13:04,201 --> 01:13:06,300
things.
So you see him like going over all these

1826
01:13:06,301 --> 01:13:10,050
variables and that's one of the reasons
while while cry at movies,

1827
01:13:10,051 --> 01:13:11,790
it's also one of the reasons why,
you know,

1828
01:13:11,791 --> 01:13:14,520
like he'll,
he'll go over all various aspects of

1829
01:13:14,521 --> 01:13:16,470
himself.
We're talking about how smart you are,

1830
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:19,380
that it's a problem.
How To pee.

1831
01:13:20,060 --> 01:13:22,260
I'll be lucky.
I'll have to go again to my bladder is

1832
01:13:22,261 --> 01:13:23,120
weird,
like

1833
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:25,800
it's already 3:00.

1834
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:28,290
So you made it an hour and a half in.
We're an hour and a half in.

1835
01:13:28,670 --> 01:13:30,200
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

1836
01:13:30,230 --> 01:13:30,550
I,
I,

1837
01:13:30,550 --> 01:13:31,560
uh,
Ip,

1838
01:13:31,580 --> 01:13:32,790
uh,
so much that,

1839
01:13:32,791 --> 01:13:34,650
uh,
that when you hold it for a little

1840
01:13:34,651 --> 01:13:36,720
while,
then your body doesn't release it all.

1841
01:13:36,830 --> 01:13:39,150
Uh,
my bladder is a fucking nightmare.

1842
01:13:39,151 --> 01:13:41,340
But I buy apnea so bad.
I wake up and have to Piss a lot.

1843
01:13:41,341 --> 01:13:43,560
But I think that someone told me that
your body waking you up so you don't

1844
01:13:43,561 --> 01:13:45,390
suffocate.
Like when you're not breathing,

1845
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:47,090
your body's going breathe,
breathing,

1846
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:49,560
yelling and your body will sending the
signal pis and that gets you up and you

1847
01:13:49,570 --> 01:13:50,210
go,
really?

1848
01:13:50,210 --> 01:13:51,330
Yeah,
I've heard that.

1849
01:13:51,331 --> 01:13:53,610
I don't know how true it is,
but I couldn't be pissing that much.

1850
01:13:54,020 --> 01:13:55,620
Well,
if you drink a lot of water,

1851
01:13:55,621 --> 01:13:57,600
you would be.
I pissed sometimes the middle of the

1852
01:13:57,601 --> 01:13:57,810
night.

1853
01:13:57,810 --> 01:14:00,180
I try not to drink at night,
but I get thirsty.

1854
01:14:00,210 --> 01:14:00,900
Yeah,
me too.

1855
01:14:00,900 --> 01:14:01,800
I'm going to get thirsty.
I'm like,

1856
01:14:02,130 --> 01:14:05,580
I'd rather have a drink of water now and
get up in the middle of the night to

1857
01:14:05,581 --> 01:14:07,200
pee.
I love a good beverage.

1858
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:08,093
Yeah.
Why not?

1859
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:10,050
I know.
Treat myself or something like 70

1860
01:14:10,051 --> 01:14:11,710
percent water or some.
I know,

1861
01:14:11,711 --> 01:14:14,150
but it's making my life almost to the
point of being unmanageable.

1862
01:14:14,250 --> 01:14:18,280
I saw logan with the girl and she's.
I'm not kidding when I tell you I went

1863
01:14:18,281 --> 01:14:21,580
to the bathroom 12 times.
It's embarrassing during the movie.

1864
01:14:21,610 --> 01:14:22,990
During the movie 12?
Yeah.

1865
01:14:22,991 --> 01:14:24,630
I have a couple of coffees.
Where do I had my blog?

1866
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:26,800
I've had sonograms already.
Fucking bladder 12?

1867
01:14:26,860 --> 01:14:27,790
Yeah.
Maybe how old?

1868
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:29,380
How long is the movie?
Two hours.

1869
01:14:29,381 --> 01:14:31,120
Twenty four hours.
You.

1870
01:14:31,540 --> 01:14:33,040
That's insane.
It's crazy.

1871
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:36,400
I've.
So you left any every 10 minutes at one

1872
01:14:36,401 --> 01:14:36,670
point.

1873
01:14:36,670 --> 01:14:37,510
Towards the end.
I did,

1874
01:14:37,511 --> 01:14:40,480
yeah.
I'm one I had.

1875
01:14:40,481 --> 01:14:42,940
It's a two hour movie.
That means you left every 10 minutes.

1876
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,070
Yeah,
I mean that's without exaggeration.

1877
01:14:45,071 --> 01:14:47,020
Yeah.
I pissed when I'm on a roll.

1878
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:49,270
It's nonstop.
The girl must be like,

1879
01:14:49,271 --> 01:14:51,640
what the fuck is this guy doing?
She knows me.

1880
01:14:51,641 --> 01:14:53,800
I told you like Ip a lot though.
He's got to sit in the aisle.

1881
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:58,090
I flew to la the first time I went to La
was with Patrice and I are on a twa

1882
01:14:58,091 --> 01:15:00,760
flight and um,
I was in the window and he was in the

1883
01:15:00,761 --> 01:15:01,300
aisle,
you know,

1884
01:15:01,300 --> 01:15:02,260
for maximum comfort.

1885
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:08,430
Fucking pissed so many times.
And this is 94,

1886
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:11,920
95 and Patrice said to me,
you got to get checked for diabetes,

1887
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:13,120
you,
I think you're diabetic.

1888
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:15,970
And he was diabetic so he fucking
freaked me out.

1889
01:15:15,971 --> 01:15:18,120
So I went and got checked.
I had been checked multiple times since

1890
01:15:18,121 --> 01:15:20,680
then.
I'm not diabetic and I've had my bladder

1891
01:15:20,681 --> 01:15:23,140
like sonogrammed and I like the size of
it.

1892
01:15:23,590 --> 01:15:25,840
Different checks and they said no,
it's a normal size.

1893
01:15:26,020 --> 01:15:28,540
You just peel it.
You've got a lot of thinking going on.

1894
01:15:28,541 --> 01:15:29,860
Jim Norton,
I do too much.

1895
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:32,200
It's too much.
That's one of the things we were talking

1896
01:15:32,201 --> 01:15:32,560
about.
You,

1897
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:34,240
you think a lot.
I mean,

1898
01:15:34,241 --> 01:15:37,630
it's because you're smart because you're
taking in variables,

1899
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:39,760
you know,
there's a lot of variables involved.

1900
01:15:39,970 --> 01:15:41,590
Nice.
I always used to tell that to people

1901
01:15:41,591 --> 01:15:42,424
that were,
um,

1902
01:15:43,180 --> 01:15:45,970
my students back when I was teaching
taekwondo and they would go to fight and

1903
01:15:45,971 --> 01:15:49,300
tournament's and they'd be really
nervous and I would explain that the

1904
01:15:49,301 --> 01:15:51,160
smarter you are,
the more nervous are going to be.

1905
01:15:51,580 --> 01:15:55,090
And that's just part of reality because
you're aware of the variables.

1906
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:59,050
The stupid people are not going to be
aware of all the possibilities in their

1907
01:15:59,051 --> 01:16:00,220
eyes,
in their mind.

1908
01:16:00,221 --> 01:16:04,570
Everything's gonna go great.
And that might be good if it goes great,

1909
01:16:04,571 --> 01:16:07,390
but it might be terrible if it goes
wrongs in the reality gets shattered

1910
01:16:07,391 --> 01:16:09,740
because they can't handle the fact that
it happened.

1911
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:12,610
I didn't see this coming exactly.
Whereas I'm always prepared for the

1912
01:16:12,611 --> 01:16:14,380
fucking Florida fallout.
Yeah,

1913
01:16:14,410 --> 01:16:15,221
exactly.
You're,

1914
01:16:15,221 --> 01:16:17,470
you're,
but you might be prepared to much.

1915
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:20,130
You might be thinking too much about all
the different variables.

1916
01:16:20,180 --> 01:16:22,870
They probably wouldn't like.
You're like the whole worry about your

1917
01:16:22,871 --> 01:16:25,570
arm when your arm's fine right now.
Yeah,

1918
01:16:25,571 --> 01:16:28,690
it is right now it's good,
but then like last week I was there two

1919
01:16:28,691 --> 01:16:32,560
weeks ago I was doing these curls and I
and I started doing curls.

1920
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:33,760
Who's got you doing curls?
Oh,

1921
01:16:34,030 --> 01:16:34,870
my trend.
I think I asked her.

1922
01:16:34,871 --> 01:16:35,950
I wanted to do them and they're not
good.

1923
01:16:36,970 --> 01:16:40,650
I don't believe in isolation exercises.
There's very little times in life we're

1924
01:16:40,670 --> 01:16:43,810
standing there doing this.
Just lifting things up with one arm.

1925
01:16:44,060 --> 01:16:49,060
A lot of time in life I'm doing a lot of
times that leads to imbalances I feel

1926
01:16:49,901 --> 01:16:52,030
like,
and as I got older I really believe this

1927
01:16:52,031 --> 01:16:55,720
more and more and the more really good
trainers that I've talked to,

1928
01:16:55,721 --> 01:16:59,680
the more they sort of harp on this exact
same things that you should treat the

1929
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:03,040
body like a unit,
like it's one large unit and so if

1930
01:17:03,041 --> 01:17:06,700
you're going to do something,
it should involve for the most part with

1931
01:17:06,701 --> 01:17:10,100
a few exceptions.
It's not terrible to do some isolation

1932
01:17:10,101 --> 01:17:12,320
exercises,
but I think for the most part it should

1933
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:16,700
involve most of your body or large
muscle groups like a squat or deadlift

1934
01:17:16,710 --> 01:17:19,340
is one of the best because the deadlift
involves your arms,

1935
01:17:19,341 --> 01:17:20,690
your back,
your shoulders,

1936
01:17:20,691 --> 01:17:22,040
your legs,
your calves.

1937
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:24,350
I mean there's so much involved in a
dead lift.

1938
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:28,520
It's one of the reasons why it's such a
great exercise for overall physical

1939
01:17:28,521 --> 01:17:33,170
strength and I think for arms like chin
ups and rows and things along those

1940
01:17:33,171 --> 01:17:34,140
lines.
When you're doing that,

1941
01:17:34,141 --> 01:17:36,620
like you're involving so much of your
body,

1942
01:17:36,621 --> 01:17:38,870
like one armed rose,
it's your back.

1943
01:17:38,871 --> 01:17:40,880
It's your core.
It's your arms,

1944
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,080
your shoulders,
it's,

1945
01:17:42,270 --> 01:17:45,260
there's a lot going on there.
Whereas the curl is kind of just your

1946
01:17:45,261 --> 01:17:47,330
bicep and your forearm,
you know,

1947
01:17:47,331 --> 01:17:49,010
it's really mostly what's going on
there.

1948
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:50,010
He,
I do a lot of those too.

1949
01:17:50,020 --> 01:17:52,730
Those things we get pull into the thing
or you've thrown a punch display or

1950
01:17:52,731 --> 01:17:54,380
whatever.
Really robust sizing.

1951
01:17:54,650 --> 01:17:56,920
It's not a very particularly exercise
I'm proud of.

1952
01:17:57,570 --> 01:17:59,420
When you,
when they have you lifting weights,

1953
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:03,710
are you lifting weights for a high
reputations or low repetitions?

1954
01:18:04,110 --> 01:18:07,030
I depends on how tired I am really like,
you know,

1955
01:18:07,340 --> 01:18:10,520
it really depends on what if I tell her.
Like I sometimes I say I just want to do

1956
01:18:10,521 --> 01:18:13,850
like minor things today because I'm so
exhausted.

1957
01:18:13,851 --> 01:18:15,110
It's like,
and I know it sounds like I'm being a

1958
01:18:15,111 --> 01:18:17,780
bitch,
but I know how I feel and I'm like,

1959
01:18:17,781 --> 01:18:21,260
I feel like I'm going to pass out.
Like I feel like it's like a fog.

1960
01:18:21,261 --> 01:18:23,420
It's not even,
it doesn't raise up when you start

1961
01:18:23,421 --> 01:18:24,920
working out a little bit.
It does,

1962
01:18:24,921 --> 01:18:28,430
but it's literally like s,
like you're,

1963
01:18:28,490 --> 01:18:32,260
there's a thickness to it.
It's like looking through things.

1964
01:18:32,540 --> 01:18:35,780
I know what you're talking about.
I had sleep when I have sleep apnea now,

1965
01:18:35,781 --> 01:18:38,090
but now I wear a mouthpiece.
Right?

1966
01:18:38,130 --> 01:18:39,770
Oh yeah.
The mouthpiece is incredible,

1967
01:18:39,771 --> 01:18:41,660
but yours.
You got the one that goes over your

1968
01:18:41,661 --> 01:18:43,610
tongue.
I want to get one like that because I

1969
01:18:43,611 --> 01:18:45,600
have to push my draw out,
which helps,

1970
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:47,660
but it doesn't fucking.

1971
01:18:47,690 --> 01:18:51,620
I got the central apnea to your apnea is
a completely different animal.

1972
01:18:51,621 --> 01:18:55,010
Your happening is your brain tells you
to stop breathing.

1973
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:57,590
That's a totally different thing.
I also do.

1974
01:18:57,591 --> 01:18:59,120
I also had obstructive.
I have both.

1975
01:18:59,150 --> 01:18:59,741
You have both?
Yeah.

1976
01:18:59,741 --> 01:19:00,720
Yeah.
I have that.

1977
01:19:00,721 --> 01:19:02,990
I have that one to Jesus Christ.
That stinks,

1978
01:19:02,991 --> 01:19:05,950
dude.
The way the brain one is the creepiest

1979
01:19:05,970 --> 01:19:08,330
because obstructive,
all you need is a mouthpiece in is good.

1980
01:19:08,331 --> 01:19:13,100
Like I have the obstructive.
My tongue is too big and so it covers my

1981
01:19:13,101 --> 01:19:15,950
air hole when I lay on my back and my
neck and it falls.

1982
01:19:16,090 --> 01:19:18,550
That's a lot of football players.
Weightlifter.

1983
01:19:18,650 --> 01:19:19,760
Reggie like died.
Yeah.

1984
01:19:19,761 --> 01:19:23,390
They get a huge,
huge problem with that and a guys like

1985
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:26,690
that also that take sleeping pills.
That becomes a giant issue because then

1986
01:19:26,691 --> 01:19:29,210
you don't wake up,
so you have like big ass neck,

1987
01:19:29,211 --> 01:19:30,230
big old weight lifter neck.

1988
01:19:30,230 --> 01:19:33,620
They live back in your tongue.
Literally choke you to death.

1989
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:34,381
Yeah.
And they,

1990
01:19:34,381 --> 01:19:36,710
they take probably the sleeping pills,
I'm guessing because you're so fucking

1991
01:19:36,711 --> 01:19:38,600
tired of waking up every two minutes.
Exactly.

1992
01:19:38,620 --> 01:19:41,090
And they're always exhausted.
Like I'm getting a good night's sleep

1993
01:19:41,500 --> 01:19:43,290
from.
I'll take a Melatonin once in a while.

1994
01:19:43,370 --> 01:19:44,710
Melatonin is great.
We have on it.

1995
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:48,200
We have a spray that's really good.
Sublingual under tongue.

1996
01:19:48,201 --> 01:19:49,160
Some really great.
Yeah.

1997
01:19:49,161 --> 01:19:50,100
I'll get you some.
Yeah,

1998
01:19:50,140 --> 01:19:51,760
I would like to try that stuff because
uh,

1999
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:52,510
yeah,
I'm,

2000
01:19:52,510 --> 01:19:54,650
you know,
I want to sleep better but I just can't

2001
01:19:54,651 --> 01:19:56,330
fuck.
I just don't know what they can do other

2002
01:19:56,331 --> 01:19:59,030
than that mask though for,
for that brain stuff.

2003
01:19:59,060 --> 01:20:01,760
Like if it's your brain shutting off
your breathing,

2004
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:03,260
I don't get it.
I don't know what it is.

2005
01:20:03,261 --> 01:20:05,870
It just doesn't send the signal.
It's got to be a chemical thing.

2006
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:08,700
I think your brain bored with too much
piece.

2007
01:20:09,060 --> 01:20:10,670
I'm like,
this motherfucker sleep into a good.

2008
01:20:10,860 --> 01:20:14,280
That's probably what it is.
Let's make this more interesting than I

2009
01:20:14,281 --> 01:20:15,900
do.
I wake up and I checked my phone,

2010
01:20:16,050 --> 01:20:17,700
which will always be.
Keeps me awake.

2011
01:20:17,730 --> 01:20:20,570
Like I'll check my text messages or I'll
tell you two in the middle of the night.

2012
01:20:20,620 --> 01:20:22,380
At times I will yell a little.
Let's just happened.

2013
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:23,970
You can't do that.
No,

2014
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:24,910
that's very bad.
Yeah,

2015
01:20:24,930 --> 01:20:25,950
I don't do that.
I sleep better.

2016
01:20:25,951 --> 01:20:28,380
My phone's across the room.
Like you put it across the room and it's

2017
01:20:28,381 --> 01:20:29,340
like,
oh cool.

2018
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:33,990
I shut my phone off before I start
reading and then when I'm done reading

2019
01:20:34,020 --> 01:20:35,250
the phone stays off.
Oh,

2020
01:20:35,251 --> 01:20:37,830
you don't check it before,
but that's probably better that I don't

2021
01:20:37,831 --> 01:20:41,830
check it before bed and the only thing I
check in the morning is important shit.

2022
01:20:41,830 --> 01:20:46,830
If someone's text messaging me,
it's important but I just do it less and

2023
01:20:47,101 --> 01:20:49,650
less.
I mean I think the phone is a tool but

2024
01:20:49,651 --> 01:20:51,090
it's also very,
very,

2025
01:20:51,091 --> 01:20:55,910
very addictive and being connected to
social media and you know,

2026
01:20:55,950 --> 01:20:57,800
having.
It's usually one of my friends do it.

2027
01:20:57,810 --> 01:20:58,970
Have you seen this?
And they'll send me a,

2028
01:20:58,980 --> 01:21:01,320
like a text message and I'll click on
the link and I'm like,

2029
01:21:01,321 --> 01:21:03,540
Oh,
fucking Christ at some crazy story or

2030
01:21:03,690 --> 01:21:06,910
some dude who got killed by a bear or
something nutty now.

2031
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:10,260
And then half hour later I'm still on
the toilet bowl.

2032
01:21:10,261 --> 01:21:12,240
Now my legs are numb.
And I'm like,

2033
01:21:12,241 --> 01:21:15,300
what the fuck am I doing with my life?
Like I got tired of doing that.

2034
01:21:15,540 --> 01:21:18,150
And so now I just look at my phone real
quick.

2035
01:21:18,151 --> 01:21:19,710
Anything important?
No good.

2036
01:21:19,950 --> 01:21:23,790
Leave it alone and then I'll go work out
and I'll go get my day started.

2037
01:21:23,850 --> 01:21:25,860
Do you keep your phone with you and you
work out or do you leave it in the

2038
01:21:25,861 --> 01:21:26,610
locker?
No,

2039
01:21:26,610 --> 01:21:29,310
no.
Well I work out a good percentage of the

2040
01:21:29,311 --> 01:21:31,290
time.
If I'm not doing Jujitsu,

2041
01:21:31,740 --> 01:21:34,110
Jujitsu is in my blocker or it's in my
bag.

2042
01:21:34,340 --> 01:21:37,650
Um,
but if I'm at home lifting weights,

2043
01:21:37,651 --> 01:21:39,150
like I lift weights in my own,
my house,

2044
01:21:39,510 --> 01:21:40,980
um,
I don't even touch it.

2045
01:21:41,030 --> 01:21:43,650
Just leave it alone,
just put it away somewhere and I'll do

2046
01:21:43,651 --> 01:21:45,900
it in between sets.
I'll kind of look at it for a second.

2047
01:21:45,901 --> 01:21:48,510
But fuck that man there too.
God Damn addictive.

2048
01:21:48,630 --> 01:21:51,390
They're too addictive.
But here's the other problem.

2049
01:21:51,391 --> 01:21:54,810
People get mad at me because it'll be
like 2:00 in the afternoon and I haven't

2050
01:21:54,811 --> 01:21:58,440
responded to their test yet because I've
got 30 of them and I look at my text

2051
01:21:58,441 --> 01:22:01,050
message just 30 fucking text messages.
I can't respond to them.

2052
01:22:01,050 --> 01:22:01,930
All right.
Don't have.

2053
01:22:02,220 --> 01:22:05,340
Because that takes you a half an hour.
Literally each one takes a minute.

2054
01:22:05,710 --> 01:22:08,100
You respond to each one,
you've got a half an hour down,

2055
01:22:08,130 --> 01:22:11,400
just text messages.
And when you send someone something like

2056
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:13,230
here's one.
I don't respond to,

2057
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:14,220
hey man,
what's going on?

2058
01:22:14,440 --> 01:22:15,540
I don't.
That's,

2059
01:22:15,730 --> 01:22:17,340
yeah,
not doing that,

2060
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:19,530
not doing that last question.
Nope,

2061
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:22,350
can't do it to terrible question.
I can't do that.

2062
01:22:22,351 --> 01:22:25,530
Going on where air breathing,
shitting

2063
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:31,410
Syria phone texting by fuck off.
And you know,

2064
01:22:31,411 --> 01:22:34,110
people just like,
sometimes they just want to connect with

2065
01:22:34,111 --> 01:22:35,100
you,
they just want to talk to you.

2066
01:22:35,101 --> 01:22:36,540
You know,
maybe it's someone I don't talk to that

2067
01:22:36,541 --> 01:22:39,360
often and they want to talk more.
They to have shit to say,

2068
01:22:40,380 --> 01:22:42,030
you know?
And then occasionally someone will say

2069
01:22:42,031 --> 01:22:45,210
something funny and you know,
it's fun to get the if there's,

2070
01:22:45,211 --> 01:22:48,300
there's pros and cons,
but it has to be managed and if it's not

2071
01:22:48,301 --> 01:22:50,640
managed to get away from you,
I don't manage it very well.

2072
01:22:50,641 --> 01:22:54,120
I think that's the problem.
I spent too much time obsessing on it.

2073
01:22:54,650 --> 01:22:57,990
And on the computer I discovered chatter
bait.

2074
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:02,940
What does that.
It's like a fucking good man.

2075
01:23:03,510 --> 01:23:05,980
They have a,
you opened it up

2076
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:10,780
and there's all of these windows of
people being sexual and you can join or

2077
01:23:10,781 --> 01:23:13,240
you can almost watch for free as a,
as a lurker,

2078
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:15,610
but you just can't tip if you're
lurking,

2079
01:23:15,611 --> 01:23:17,110
but you can just kind of go in there and
watch.

2080
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:20,590
That seems like a lot of time to it.
It's,

2081
01:23:20,591 --> 01:23:21,201
you know.
Yeah.

2082
01:23:21,201 --> 01:23:25,300
It's very addictive.
There's other sites like that too.

2083
01:23:25,301 --> 01:23:26,320
I just,
that's just the name.

2084
01:23:26,321 --> 01:23:28,540
I know I can't do it.
I don't do any of those sites.

2085
01:23:29,070 --> 01:23:31,270
I don't look at any of those.
I didn't either for a while at this one

2086
01:23:31,271 --> 01:23:31,811
I found.
I was like,

2087
01:23:31,811 --> 01:23:34,780
well it was so new.
Like the idea of it was so new to me,

2088
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,340
um,
but you know,

2089
01:23:36,341 --> 01:23:38,120
I'm,
I'm trying to stop doing it because it's

2090
01:23:38,710 --> 01:23:40,650
just,
why not even jerk off at the time just

2091
01:23:40,660 --> 01:23:42,310
watching.
It's like weird.

2092
01:23:42,460 --> 01:23:45,230
It's like what I dreamed of as a kid,
something human with your kid.

2093
01:23:45,270 --> 01:23:45,641
Like,
oh,

2094
01:23:45,641 --> 01:23:48,040
someday you're going to pick up that
phone in the kitchen and you're gonna be

2095
01:23:48,041 --> 01:23:49,780
able to see the person you're talking to
and you're like,

2096
01:23:49,781 --> 01:23:52,510
no,
now I can just open this thing and watch

2097
01:23:52,511 --> 01:23:53,950
people fucking masturbate.
I'm like,

2098
01:23:53,951 --> 01:23:56,230
Holy Shit.
So wonderful.

2099
01:23:56,410 --> 01:24:00,320
It is weird.
It didn't believe it.

2100
01:24:00,490 --> 01:24:03,010
Your brain is not ready for it.
No one's brain is.

2101
01:24:03,070 --> 01:24:06,760
And especially a guy like you that knows
a lot of people and has a lot of

2102
01:24:06,790 --> 01:24:09,220
options.
There's almost like too much coming at

2103
01:24:09,221 --> 01:24:10,570
you.
Yeah.

2104
01:24:10,571 --> 01:24:13,120
I don't know how to manage it.
And I'm so afraid of missing the party.

2105
01:24:13,121 --> 01:24:16,150
I'm so afraid of,
you know what I mean?

2106
01:24:16,151 --> 01:24:16,990
It was,
uh,

2107
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:18,400
it,
it goes back to.

2108
01:24:18,401 --> 01:24:20,080
I remember when I was a kid,
I had fucked up.

2109
01:24:20,290 --> 01:24:22,590
I don't know what I did,
but I remember my friends,

2110
01:24:22,591 --> 01:24:23,890
you know,
these two black kids there,

2111
01:24:23,891 --> 01:24:27,310
I think they were twins,
pr and Randall and they wanted me to go

2112
01:24:27,311 --> 01:24:30,250
to the store with them and my mother
wouldn't let me go and I remember

2113
01:24:30,251 --> 01:24:35,200
screaming and crying and being so
fucking angry and it was like I was

2114
01:24:35,201 --> 01:24:36,770
going to miss something like that.

2115
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,470
The idea,
like all these guys,

2116
01:24:38,471 --> 01:24:41,200
I like going to the store,
fucking Shit's gonna happen.

2117
01:24:41,580 --> 01:24:45,940
I'm stuck with this bitch
was so displeased,

2118
01:24:46,770 --> 01:24:49,270
but it was that feeling of missing.
Oh yeah.

2119
01:24:49,300 --> 01:24:52,870
This great thing with the fear of
missing out,

2120
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:54,310
you know,
who doesn't have the fear of missing

2121
01:24:54,311 --> 01:24:55,990
out.
I love him for dice.

2122
01:24:56,230 --> 01:24:59,410
Never fucked.
And I told this story recently,

2123
01:24:59,411 --> 01:25:02,440
which is what made me think of it,
is we did a show that I opened for him

2124
01:25:02,441 --> 01:25:07,390
from 97 to 2000 in vegas shows tiger
woods came into the show to like time I

2125
01:25:07,391 --> 01:25:09,460
ever met him.
I ran out into the lone pine nuts on it

2126
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,400
and dice.
They said tigers might come back and he

2127
01:25:12,401 --> 01:25:13,310
goes,
let them.

2128
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:18,340
I'm going up to the room.
He didn't give a fuck that the greatest

2129
01:25:18,341 --> 01:25:20,630
golf for a live one to come back and say
hi man,

2130
01:25:20,650 --> 01:25:21,483
hate tiger.

2131
01:25:21,820 --> 01:25:25,810
Go for it and invent.
It wasn't showing that he,

2132
01:25:25,811 --> 01:25:28,000
you know,
dice fucking meant it.

2133
01:25:28,660 --> 01:25:31,030
Went up to his room and he wanted a
creme ballet.

2134
01:25:31,270 --> 01:25:34,270
That was what he.
He didn't give a shit about missing

2135
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:36,780
because in his advice is fucking nuts
and he's the party,

2136
01:25:37,090 --> 01:25:40,540
but I admired that so much.
That ability to live without feeling

2137
01:25:40,541 --> 01:25:45,010
like you're going to miss out,
we're missing out is this fucking fear.

2138
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:49,920
It's addict is an addict stuff.
I used to have that with this pool hall

2139
01:25:49,990 --> 01:25:52,420
used to go to.
I used to go to this pool hall when I

2140
01:25:52,421 --> 01:25:55,870
lived in New York and it was a fucking
great place and there was executive

2141
01:25:55,871 --> 01:25:58,060
billiards in white plains,
New York and there was always a lot of

2142
01:25:58,061 --> 01:26:00,580
gambling going on.
A lot of big gambling games.

2143
01:26:00,581 --> 01:26:03,710
Guys would come in from out of town or
were like great pool and people would

2144
01:26:03,711 --> 01:26:06,890
sit and watch and it was always
something happened and this was.

2145
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:09,830
I didn't have a cell phone back then,
so this was like I'd be on a date with

2146
01:26:09,831 --> 01:26:11,180
my girlfriend.
I'd just be thinking,

2147
01:26:11,181 --> 01:26:12,440
man,
there's something going on at the pool

2148
01:26:12,441 --> 01:26:14,620
hall right now.
It's probably happening.

2149
01:26:14,630 --> 01:26:17,060
Something's going down the street guys
are betting.

2150
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:19,430
Guys are playing probably a lot of
action.

2151
01:26:19,460 --> 01:26:22,550
Something happened.
Total addict stuff was really when you

2152
01:26:22,551 --> 01:26:23,660
get.
There's nothing happening.

2153
01:26:23,990 --> 01:26:25,580
Sometimes there was though.
That's the problem.

2154
01:26:25,581 --> 01:26:26,414
Yeah,
once in a while,

2155
01:26:26,510 --> 01:26:29,520
but it's the one time there is.
It wipes out the 40 counties.

2156
01:26:29,521 --> 01:26:30,410
There wasn't.
Yeah,

2157
01:26:30,420 --> 01:26:31,430
it does.
It does.

2158
01:26:31,431 --> 01:26:33,020
It makes it worthwhile.
It's like fishing.

2159
01:26:33,230 --> 01:26:35,870
You can go fishing three days in a row
and not catch a goddamn thing.

2160
01:26:35,871 --> 01:26:39,800
Go goddamn fishing sucks and then one
day you hook a giant Sam and you're

2161
01:26:39,801 --> 01:26:41,270
like,
Holy Shit.

2162
01:26:41,390 --> 01:26:44,600
Another year of fishing because at one
time it's weird how that one,

2163
01:26:44,601 --> 01:26:47,000
the one time it worked overrides all the
times it does.

2164
01:26:47,270 --> 01:26:50,120
It's not rational,
but I lived my life like that.

2165
01:26:50,140 --> 01:26:51,920
Like,
well that's like people going out and

2166
01:26:51,921 --> 01:26:53,450
trying to get laid,
you know?

2167
01:26:53,480 --> 01:26:55,580
I mean,
how often does that work when a guy goes

2168
01:26:55,581 --> 01:26:58,070
out trying to get laid at a bar,
the average fellow,

2169
01:26:58,460 --> 01:27:01,130
what is it like?
Is he like three out of 10?

2170
01:27:01,131 --> 01:27:04,850
If he's great at it,
not even maybe one at a 10.

2171
01:27:04,851 --> 01:27:08,090
Right?
Ten nights trying to find the girl,

2172
01:27:08,091 --> 01:27:09,800
your dreams,
the odds.

2173
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:13,760
Theodicy finding her in one of those 10
or finding a hot girl or finding a girl

2174
01:27:13,761 --> 01:27:15,470
you're attracted to.
Some guys will pull it off.

2175
01:27:15,471 --> 01:27:18,080
Chris delea could probably go out and
face the handsome guy I.

2176
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:19,850
I give Chris.
He can probably pull a fucking four or

2177
01:27:19,851 --> 01:27:22,590
five nights out of 10.
We're pulling home at least an eight and

2178
01:27:22,660 --> 01:27:24,630
he's also famous and he's funny.
Yeah.

2179
01:27:24,790 --> 01:27:26,810
Funny.
He's got a good personality.

2180
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:29,990
Good looking guy.
He's a combination as another man to

2181
01:27:29,991 --> 01:27:30,980
watch.
It's revolting.

2182
01:27:30,981 --> 01:27:32,300
Beautiful.
It really bugs me.

2183
01:27:32,470 --> 01:27:33,370
Does it?
Yes,

2184
01:27:33,371 --> 01:27:35,960
of course.
It's all I needed to date.

2185
01:27:35,961 --> 01:27:40,700
A girl who wants to fuck him on the
finished have no shot because he is

2186
01:27:40,701 --> 01:27:41,990
funny.
He wasn't funny.

2187
01:27:41,991 --> 01:27:43,320
It will be okay,
but if a guy is funny,

2188
01:27:43,340 --> 01:27:46,160
he's like,
I can't even get that one.

2189
01:27:46,161 --> 01:27:48,380
Trump card I have is that I'm a funny
guy,

2190
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:50,560
but if there's another dude's funny and
he's good looking,

2191
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:52,150
I'm like,
oh well I used to have to give up.

2192
01:27:52,510 --> 01:27:55,400
I have to concede defeat,
you know,

2193
01:27:55,401 --> 01:27:58,010
unless he's a conservative guy sexually,
like it may be that maybe if she's a

2194
01:27:58,011 --> 01:27:59,720
pervert and.
Right,

2195
01:27:59,780 --> 01:28:03,710
maybe she's not.
He's not sucking on her hands or feet.

2196
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:05,750
I'm not even that big Ip.
I just found them later in life.

2197
01:28:05,751 --> 01:28:07,710
I just think it's fun to talk about
because you beat up people thought,

2198
01:28:07,950 --> 01:28:10,640
but I'm not a big foot guy,
but I do ask the size of feet.

2199
01:28:11,030 --> 01:28:11,930
Really?
Yeah,

2200
01:28:11,931 --> 01:28:13,370
I like them big.
Really?

2201
01:28:13,430 --> 01:28:14,510
Yeah.
Why do you like them big?

2202
01:28:14,511 --> 01:28:16,070
I don't know.
Piking Morris better.

2203
01:28:16,071 --> 01:28:16,970
I'm a greedy fuck.

2204
01:28:21,910 --> 01:28:24,100
Ah,
ah.

2205
01:28:24,790 --> 01:28:26,480
Do you lose the sound?
Yeah.

2206
01:28:26,481 --> 01:28:28,060
What happened?
Plugged the uh,

2207
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:30,170
there's a little thing there.
Has to be plugged in.

2208
01:28:30,360 --> 01:28:35,060
I'll probably knocked it out.
We need to fix that with our next setup.

2209
01:28:35,090 --> 01:28:35,930
No,
I didn't fix it.

2210
01:28:36,110 --> 01:28:37,640
I'm sorry.
We'll get it.

2211
01:28:38,150 --> 01:28:39,200
Did I break it?
Oh,

2212
01:28:39,201 --> 01:28:43,900
I just knocked that out.
Old Radio tape that was taped.

2213
01:28:44,380 --> 01:28:45,380
That special.
Violent.

2214
01:28:45,940 --> 01:28:48,170
Hold the tape for you.
I just crushed my legs,

2215
01:28:49,490 --> 01:28:51,170
my legs and properly broke the
equipment.

2216
01:28:51,950 --> 01:28:53,090
So yeah,
that's the one ace in the hole.

2217
01:28:53,091 --> 01:28:55,430
I feel like I got fucking,
I don't know,

2218
01:28:55,431 --> 01:28:57,840
but I,
I want it to be like A.

2219
01:28:57,840 --> 01:28:59,680
I'm,
my life is fun and I wanted.

2220
01:28:59,690 --> 01:29:01,440
Yeah,
I kind of wanted to not settle down,

2221
01:29:01,441 --> 01:29:04,560
but I wanted to see somebody regularly.
When was the last time you did that

2222
01:29:04,561 --> 01:29:06,120
though?
You had a girlfriend for a while when we

2223
01:29:06,121 --> 01:29:08,970
were doing the virus tour way back in
the day.

2224
01:29:08,970 --> 01:29:10,770
What was that like?
It might've been 10 years ago.

2225
01:29:10,860 --> 01:29:15,060
That was 2006 and seven or seven and
eight maybe.

2226
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:20,130
I had a girlfriend back then,
but after that I dated a girl seriously

2227
01:29:20,131 --> 01:29:22,830
to few years and we broke up.
It was just too much fighting.

2228
01:29:22,831 --> 01:29:24,240
I'm difficult.
She's my best friend.

2229
01:29:24,241 --> 01:29:26,100
I still talk to all the time.
We just don't date anymore.

2230
01:29:26,290 --> 01:29:28,170
You haven't slept with her five years,
but we're still,

2231
01:29:28,470 --> 01:29:29,910
you know,
she's a great person.

2232
01:29:29,940 --> 01:29:33,450
Too much fighting,
too much fighting and everything.

2233
01:29:33,451 --> 01:29:36,810
I liked the arguing thing,
but I get obsessed with feeling like

2234
01:29:36,811 --> 01:29:39,690
I've been wronged or humiliated.
It's that whole.

2235
01:29:39,691 --> 01:29:40,501
Yeah,
it's crazy.

2236
01:29:40,501 --> 01:29:41,910
It's that whole thing.
It's you.

2237
01:29:41,940 --> 01:29:46,410
Do you realize that you're obsessed with
it and it's not real while you're doing

2238
01:29:46,411 --> 01:29:46,891
it?
Yeah,

2239
01:29:46,891 --> 01:29:48,510
like if I had to write it down,
I could write it down,

2240
01:29:48,660 --> 01:29:51,090
but it doesn't change that because I got
addicted to feeling shitty.

2241
01:29:51,240 --> 01:29:52,650
Like I used to trap girls.
Right.

2242
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:56,520
I have a girl tell me like a.
I would make them tell me if they're ex

2243
01:29:56,521 --> 01:29:58,020
boyfriends.
Dick is bigger than mine.

2244
01:29:58,810 --> 01:30:01,920
Okay.
And let's be honest.

2245
01:30:01,921 --> 01:30:03,540
The odds,
the odds were not bad.

2246
01:30:04,450 --> 01:30:09,450
Case Strap on and then you would get
upset that they had brought it up or

2247
01:30:09,721 --> 01:30:12,300
just be.
It will give me an excuse to hate myself

2248
01:30:12,810 --> 01:30:17,700
and feel bad about myself and like I'm
worthless and then that way there was

2249
01:30:17,701 --> 01:30:20,390
nothing they could do to make me feel
bad.

2250
01:30:20,420 --> 01:30:24,660
I think this self fulfilling prophecy.
And then I dated a girl one time who is

2251
01:30:24,661 --> 01:30:28,790
ex boyfriend had a giant Dick and she
timed it before I dated her I,

2252
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:30,110
he said it was like,
there was,

2253
01:30:30,111 --> 01:30:30,944
it was,
you know,

2254
01:30:31,380 --> 01:30:34,730
and um,
she had a video fucking him and she's

2255
01:30:34,750 --> 01:30:36,000
like,
you're not going to want to see that.

2256
01:30:36,360 --> 01:30:38,190
And uh,
the way she said it was so sexy,

2257
01:30:38,191 --> 01:30:41,520
like a naughty girl,
I wanted to see it and I made myself

2258
01:30:41,521 --> 01:30:44,580
watch it and it turned me on to see her
like that,

2259
01:30:44,790 --> 01:30:47,490
like to see her being dirt.
Like I took something that was going to

2260
01:30:47,491 --> 01:30:49,350
torture myself with and I'm like,
fuck it.

2261
01:30:49,620 --> 01:30:51,870
It was almost like you throw your hands
up and you go with it.

2262
01:30:52,250 --> 01:30:56,280
Like instead of being ashamed and
feeling bad about myself because of her

2263
01:30:56,281 --> 01:30:58,950
past,
take a woman's past and just make it a

2264
01:30:58,951 --> 01:31:02,820
dirty part of her that you like.
So then I never gave a fuck again about

2265
01:31:02,821 --> 01:31:03,190
her.
Boy,

2266
01:31:03,190 --> 01:31:05,010
I don't care who you dated before me
now.

2267
01:31:05,610 --> 01:31:07,260
His Dick was bigger.
Good for you.

2268
01:31:07,261 --> 01:31:08,850
Let's hear about it while I'm eating
your pussy.

2269
01:31:09,090 --> 01:31:11,190
That's what I like.
Tell me all about it.

2270
01:31:12,240 --> 01:31:15,750
He would do better,
wouldn't be fun.

2271
01:31:15,960 --> 01:31:19,290
Then it becomes a fun thing that you can
fetishize and make good and they don't

2272
01:31:19,291 --> 01:31:21,120
ever have to feel embarrassed about
their past or like,

2273
01:31:21,121 --> 01:31:22,590
oh,
I can't tell this guy that.

2274
01:31:22,860 --> 01:31:26,040
That's a rare girl.
That'll show you a video of another guy.

2275
01:31:26,041 --> 01:31:27,240
Fucking her.
Yeah.

2276
01:31:27,241 --> 01:31:30,780
But I bugged her for it,
but I kind of knew at that moment I knew

2277
01:31:30,781 --> 01:31:34,140
it that moment that it was a make or
break because I had done this my whole

2278
01:31:34,141 --> 01:31:37,680
life with girls.
I had set up these scenarios where I was

2279
01:31:37,681 --> 01:31:39,810
going to lose and then we're going to be
fucking.

2280
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:44,100
I was going to purposely put a wedge in
between that wasn't necessary that I

2281
01:31:44,101 --> 01:31:46,830
didn't want to deal with this girl
because she was super sexy and funny and

2282
01:31:47,160 --> 01:31:50,730
I just knew it was dumb.
So I made myself sit through it and see

2283
01:31:50,731 --> 01:31:53,850
how I felt about it and I was able to
turn it into a pornography and it was

2284
01:31:53,851 --> 01:31:54,420
okay.

2285
01:31:54,420 --> 01:31:58,110
And when you said that you knew that you
were doing it while you were doing it,

2286
01:31:58,140 --> 01:32:01,210
like you knew you were it while you were
doing it at times.

2287
01:32:01,211 --> 01:32:03,180
Yeah,
but not until after because I got

2288
01:32:03,190 --> 01:32:05,820
addicted to that feeling,
that burning feeling and the pity or

2289
01:32:05,830 --> 01:32:09,220
stomach when you're feeling like you've
been cheated on or you've been wrong.

2290
01:32:09,250 --> 01:32:11,020
It was just a stupid.
It was like a,

2291
01:32:11,021 --> 01:32:12,550
it was a good drug.
It was like a fucking,

2292
01:32:12,680 --> 01:32:16,660
if a familiar feeling.
So you were actually addicted to feeling

2293
01:32:16,661 --> 01:32:19,120
disrespected and shitty and.
Yeah,

2294
01:32:19,121 --> 01:32:20,470
but not in a sexy,
fun way.

2295
01:32:20,471 --> 01:32:22,360
Like now.
Oh the,

2296
01:32:22,410 --> 01:32:23,180
the,
the,

2297
01:32:23,180 --> 01:32:25,600
a good dose of humiliation makes me
crazy.

2298
01:32:25,601 --> 01:32:28,180
But it really turns me on.
Yeah,

2299
01:32:28,181 --> 01:32:29,440
it's fun.
Different.

2300
01:32:30,070 --> 01:32:32,150
It feels unique.
Yeah.

2301
01:32:32,160 --> 01:32:32,993
Yeah,
yeah.

2302
01:32:33,130 --> 01:32:34,030
Uh,
I love it.

2303
01:32:34,031 --> 01:32:36,340
Does anybody relate to that?
When you tell another friend?

2304
01:32:36,390 --> 01:32:37,120
A lot of people do.

2305
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:38,230
Oh my God,
of course.

2306
01:32:38,231 --> 01:32:39,280
Sure.
A lot of people like it.

2307
01:32:39,281 --> 01:32:42,550
They like humiliation or whatever.
They'll pay whatever it is or how many

2308
01:32:42,551 --> 01:32:44,590
guys.
And plus the women.

2309
01:32:44,620 --> 01:32:47,020
A lot of women enjoy it too.
They love telling you about that stuff

2310
01:32:47,290 --> 01:32:50,060
because it's fun.
It lets them be who they want to be and

2311
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:51,520
they don't have to.
They don't have to feel like,

2312
01:32:51,521 --> 01:32:52,990
oh,
I've got to pretend on this one.

2313
01:32:54,250 --> 01:32:56,830
I don't give a fuck what the worst
you've been.

2314
01:32:57,100 --> 01:32:59,020
The more you're going to be happy.
I walked through the door,

2315
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:01,450
you know what I mean?
Because it's going to be nothing I do

2316
01:33:01,451 --> 01:33:03,020
that's going to surprise you.
Right.

2317
01:33:03,140 --> 01:33:05,710
So that's what I kind of like is like I,
I want somebody.

2318
01:33:05,830 --> 01:33:07,510
That's why I seek out people in the sex
industry,

2319
01:33:07,511 --> 01:33:11,110
I think because I have no judgment on
it.

2320
01:33:11,111 --> 01:33:16,090
Like if you do porn or if you escorted
because I feel like you're not going to

2321
01:33:16,091 --> 01:33:16,600
judge me.

2322
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:19,930
I feel like whatever you've done,
like I'm okay with it.

2323
01:33:20,380 --> 01:33:21,560
Yeah.
That is a big.

2324
01:33:21,610 --> 01:33:24,910
That's really important because the real
issue is someone judging you,

2325
01:33:24,940 --> 01:33:25,780
right?
Yeah.

2326
01:33:25,930 --> 01:33:27,970
You know,
someone deciding that what you've done

2327
01:33:27,971 --> 01:33:31,090
is wrong.
I ended a relationship one time.

2328
01:33:31,380 --> 01:33:34,480
There was a girl I was dating and she
was one of the girls I met who didn't

2329
01:33:34,481 --> 01:33:37,480
know my past or my history of the things
I've joked about or talked about or said

2330
01:33:37,481 --> 01:33:38,290
that were true,
that made.

2331
01:33:38,290 --> 01:33:40,900
I made sure there were jokes for awhile,
but of course a truck which was,

2332
01:33:40,901 --> 01:33:41,820
you know,
and I,

2333
01:33:41,850 --> 01:33:46,330
I had to tell her a couple of things
because it's googleable right now and

2334
01:33:46,331 --> 01:33:47,164
she's going to,
you know,

2335
01:33:47,560 --> 01:33:48,620
you know,
trans,

2336
01:33:49,320 --> 01:33:52,300
you know,
it's going to come up and there's no way

2337
01:33:52,301 --> 01:33:54,560
around it.
So I talked to you about it a little.

2338
01:33:55,610 --> 01:33:58,750
This is post nuptials posts,
sex.

2339
01:33:59,170 --> 01:34:01,030
Have you had fucked?
Oh yeah,

2340
01:34:01,031 --> 01:34:02,620
yeah.
We were seeing each other for a few

2341
01:34:02,620 --> 01:34:03,580
weeks.
His marriage.

2342
01:34:03,630 --> 01:34:04,463
Yeah.
Yeah.

2343
01:34:04,510 --> 01:34:06,670
Uh,
I was teaching there for a few weeks and

2344
01:34:06,671 --> 01:34:07,450
she,
uh,

2345
01:34:07,450 --> 01:34:10,480
she got really weird with it.
She was uncomfortable with it and we

2346
01:34:10,481 --> 01:34:12,760
were eating lunch and she said something
to me like,

2347
01:34:13,090 --> 01:34:15,220
you know,
that stuff you told me about,

2348
01:34:15,221 --> 01:34:17,890
like the stuff you've done with fan
girls or whatever.

2349
01:34:18,070 --> 01:34:21,060
Like I had to say it because again,
I'm not going to be with you for four,

2350
01:34:21,090 --> 01:34:23,170
four or five months.
All of a sudden you pop it up and going,

2351
01:34:23,171 --> 01:34:25,810
I got a question.
I'm not dealing with that on the way to

2352
01:34:25,811 --> 01:34:29,770
a wedding or a fucking party and looking
at your dumb face because you don't get

2353
01:34:29,771 --> 01:34:30,940
it right.
I don't want it.

2354
01:34:31,330 --> 01:34:32,950
So I said fuck it.
I would tell her,

2355
01:34:33,170 --> 01:34:34,180
uh,
and she's like,

2356
01:34:34,181 --> 01:34:38,110
you can never tell me stuff like that
again because I have an idea of what

2357
01:34:38,111 --> 01:34:39,020
being masculine is.

2358
01:34:39,020 --> 01:34:39,701
And I'm like,
okay,

2359
01:34:39,701 --> 01:34:43,750
cool.
And as she was talking I felt every bit

2360
01:34:43,870 --> 01:34:47,740
of attraction to her drain.
Nothing.

2361
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:51,820
I liked it.
I liked the fact that I wasn't offended

2362
01:34:51,821 --> 01:34:53,520
by what she said.
I was like,

2363
01:34:53,620 --> 01:34:56,240
go fuck yourself.
Yeah.

2364
01:34:56,380 --> 01:34:58,940
Finished.
And I stopped seeing her after that

2365
01:34:59,150 --> 01:35:02,750
because that was fair that she had that.
But I don't like that scolding shit.

2366
01:35:02,751 --> 01:35:04,270
Like don't like that.
Like what?

2367
01:35:04,610 --> 01:35:08,780
We all want something when someone
judges you or scold you sexually,

2368
01:35:08,781 --> 01:35:10,130
it drives me crazy.
Yeah.

2369
01:35:10,131 --> 01:35:12,290
So it wasn't just that she was saying,
Hey,

2370
01:35:12,740 --> 01:35:16,100
I know that that's your past and I know
that this is something that you're into,

2371
01:35:16,101 --> 01:35:18,470
but I'm not into that.
That's going to be a problem.

2372
01:35:18,950 --> 01:35:22,460
Fine.
Instead she was saying that is not what

2373
01:35:22,461 --> 01:35:27,200
I think of as masculinity and you are
not masking and I can't shake that

2374
01:35:27,201 --> 01:35:28,430
again.
I didn't feel like,

2375
01:35:28,431 --> 01:35:29,150
oh I'm not.

2376
01:35:29,150 --> 01:35:29,751
I was like,
well,

2377
01:35:29,751 --> 01:35:31,810
if she had to put shit up,
put her foot down.

2378
01:35:31,820 --> 01:35:34,010
Is that what it was?
I think she just didn't want to hear

2379
01:35:34,011 --> 01:35:35,240
about it.
But like,

2380
01:35:35,241 --> 01:35:36,770
I don't care if you're into the same
stuff.

2381
01:35:36,771 --> 01:35:37,760
I get that,
you know,

2382
01:35:37,761 --> 01:35:39,830
I'm not going be in the same things a
lot of women are into.

2383
01:35:39,831 --> 01:35:42,530
Apparently the times they want to hold
hands and here I love you and sexually

2384
01:35:42,920 --> 01:35:44,450
good luck with that one.
It's not happening.

2385
01:35:45,130 --> 01:35:46,530
I'll do it.
Not while,

2386
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:49,070
not in that there's no.
I can't have a loving sexual experience

2387
01:35:49,071 --> 01:35:51,440
unless we're strangers.
Then it's a weird high.

2388
01:35:51,910 --> 01:35:52,880
Yeah,
it's crazy.

2389
01:35:54,710 --> 01:35:59,150
So if you're strangers then you can have
a loving sexual experience that I want

2390
01:35:59,151 --> 01:36:03,200
to say I love you or I want you to tell
me you love me because they feel like

2391
01:36:03,340 --> 01:36:04,300
they're strange.
Yeah.

2392
01:36:04,340 --> 01:36:05,173
Or if I'm paying them.

2393
01:36:05,570 --> 01:36:06,281
Wow.
Yeah,

2394
01:36:06,281 --> 01:36:08,060
it's weird.
It's like whatever it feels,

2395
01:36:08,780 --> 01:36:10,220
you know,
whatever it gets things mixed up a

2396
01:36:10,221 --> 01:36:11,610
little bit.
So that's just for a,

2397
01:36:11,630 --> 01:36:13,370
for a good time.
Just for a moment.

2398
01:36:13,371 --> 01:36:14,810
So like you said,
you think too much.

2399
01:36:14,811 --> 01:36:17,720
It's too much.
Do you really feel it in the moment

2400
01:36:17,721 --> 01:36:19,370
though?
Sometimes you feel connected.

2401
01:36:19,630 --> 01:36:20,460
I,
for some,

2402
01:36:20,460 --> 01:36:22,120
my,
I've analyzed this today.

2403
01:36:22,250 --> 01:36:25,190
I think what it is and what I don't know
them.

2404
01:36:25,191 --> 01:36:28,220
I don't feel any pressure and I don't
feel scared,

2405
01:36:28,221 --> 01:36:29,390
but I'm not going to do well.
I'm not,

2406
01:36:29,420 --> 01:36:31,340
I'm not gonna be scared.
I'm gonna fuck up.

2407
01:36:31,580 --> 01:36:34,430
So when,
when we're connected I feel completely

2408
01:36:34,431 --> 01:36:38,990
free just to feel things and be nice.
But once I know you and once I'm dating

2409
01:36:38,991 --> 01:36:41,810
you and I care about your opinion,
then like you said,

2410
01:36:41,811 --> 01:36:44,150
all the variables come in.
Oh fuck up.

2411
01:36:44,151 --> 01:36:46,490
I'm going to do so when there's no risk.

2412
01:36:46,640 --> 01:36:50,450
I think that's what I always liked about
exchanges of money.

2413
01:36:50,520 --> 01:36:53,750
He was never dehumanizing.
Like I never treated the girls bad.

2414
01:36:53,751 --> 01:36:55,250
I was never,
you know what I mean?

2415
01:36:55,251 --> 01:36:57,410
I always made them.
I think it was,

2416
01:36:57,411 --> 01:37:01,130
I just felt like free,
like I know she's not worried about how

2417
01:37:01,131 --> 01:37:04,910
I do so I can be comfortable.
I'm not going to be judged and I don't

2418
01:37:04,911 --> 01:37:06,380
know,
it's just maybe I'm just justifying my

2419
01:37:06,381 --> 01:37:07,260
own shit.
I don't know.

2420
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:08,960
It's just,
it's interesting.

2421
01:37:08,990 --> 01:37:11,030
It's like I've never heard that before
though.

2422
01:37:11,031 --> 01:37:16,031
The only way that you can be loving,
and I'm like lovey in a sexual sense is

2423
01:37:17,931 --> 01:37:19,250
if they're strangers.
Yeah.

2424
01:37:19,251 --> 01:37:21,620
Or if they're inaccessible.
A lot of times it was just about to

2425
01:37:21,621 --> 01:37:24,710
chase and again,
it's that addictive stupid shit.

2426
01:37:25,490 --> 01:37:27,050
But I liked that one moment.
Like,

2427
01:37:27,051 --> 01:37:28,640
yeah,
we all have these moments where we feel

2428
01:37:28,641 --> 01:37:33,260
better and that when that girl said that
I felt better about like I was glad that

2429
01:37:33,261 --> 01:37:34,820
I didn't go her.

2430
01:37:35,080 --> 01:37:36,800
Did you stay friends with her?
Oh yeah.

2431
01:37:36,890 --> 01:37:39,350
I'm not mad at her.
I'm not mad at her and she had told me

2432
01:37:39,351 --> 01:37:40,790
some sexual shit to it.
I didn't,

2433
01:37:41,030 --> 01:37:43,610
it was almost like the shit you told me
that I didn't judge you on.

2434
01:37:44,300 --> 01:37:46,400
What kind of Shit?
Um,

2435
01:37:46,640 --> 01:37:51,560
she had had a fantasy.
I could say this because he doesn't even

2436
01:37:51,561 --> 01:37:52,690
live in state anymore.
She,

2437
01:37:52,720 --> 01:37:53,990
I wouldn't say this,
but I still sore.

2438
01:37:54,020 --> 01:37:55,440
I would feel bad.
But uh,

2439
01:37:55,890 --> 01:37:59,610
she had a,
let's just say how to have an and she'd

2440
01:37:59,611 --> 01:38:02,790
never done it,
but she had had an animal fantasy or she

2441
01:38:02,791 --> 01:38:06,900
had watched a video of an animal fucking
a woman and admitted that there was

2442
01:38:06,901 --> 01:38:09,150
something about it that had turned her
on.

2443
01:38:10,460 --> 01:38:11,550
What kind of animal?
Um,

2444
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:16,450
it was a pony
and

2445
01:38:18,660 --> 01:38:22,410
something about tweets and
pause.

2446
01:38:22,620 --> 01:38:27,600
It was funny
when she told me that she wasn't being

2447
01:38:27,601 --> 01:38:29,550
dirty,
she was literally just talking to me

2448
01:38:29,551 --> 01:38:30,030
about it.

2449
01:38:30,030 --> 01:38:31,410
Well,
it's a big fat hog.

2450
01:38:31,620 --> 01:38:35,050
Yeah.
I think I blurted that out front of.

2451
01:38:35,360 --> 01:38:37,570
I do with that pony hog.
But she's,

2452
01:38:41,660 --> 01:38:42,750
well,
there's a famous,

2453
01:38:42,780 --> 01:38:45,060
that's a common fantasy.
Women in horses,

2454
01:38:45,650 --> 01:38:47,880
a horse.
His Dick is so big you can't think about

2455
01:38:47,881 --> 01:38:49,380
the horse without thinking about it's
Dick.

2456
01:38:49,500 --> 01:38:51,360
Absolutely.
When you think about a horse,

2457
01:38:51,810 --> 01:38:52,643
like you said,
oh,

2458
01:38:52,650 --> 01:38:55,890
chill thing,
it's just like it's a giant Dick.

2459
01:38:55,950 --> 01:38:58,540
A horse dicks are fucking huge.
What a great reputation.

2460
01:38:58,700 --> 01:39:00,480
So dope.
So they didn't know what a great

2461
01:39:00,481 --> 01:39:03,720
reputation they being a horse.
Socks.

2462
01:39:03,780 --> 01:39:05,610
Well it's also a lot of women that ride
them.

2463
01:39:05,611 --> 01:39:10,611
They're like these Bach and no
disrespect ladies boxy sort of almost

2464
01:39:10,651 --> 01:39:14,540
androgynous flannel shirt wearing women
that like,

2465
01:39:14,541 --> 01:39:17,160
you know,
they lose their feminine shape and they

2466
01:39:17,500 --> 01:39:20,430
like,
they get thick and they just ride that

2467
01:39:20,431 --> 01:39:23,610
horse and I always feel like they're
getting some sort of a vaginal

2468
01:39:23,611 --> 01:39:28,350
stimulation by just the constant
clop clop,

2469
01:39:28,850 --> 01:39:31,860
clop.
There's something about the movement of

2470
01:39:31,861 --> 01:39:36,030
the horse and saddle rubbing up against
their pussy and they're just wearing

2471
01:39:36,031 --> 01:39:38,280
their pussy out on the wrangler jeans.
Wow.

2472
01:39:38,281 --> 01:39:39,230
Yeah.
That's a good way to look at.

2473
01:39:39,250 --> 01:39:40,081
I'm Sam.
Yeah.

2474
01:39:40,081 --> 01:39:42,390
I never thought of that.
So I think of it women who just like,

2475
01:39:42,420 --> 01:39:45,960
I don't need men just ride this horse
and come three or four times as it goes

2476
01:39:45,961 --> 01:39:49,270
up a hill.
This giant beast with

2477
01:39:53,510 --> 01:39:56,300
Mr. Ed know.

2478
01:39:58,640 --> 01:40:01,110
I mean,
I think that's a lot of what it is.

2479
01:40:01,111 --> 01:40:03,240
I mean,
there's a lot of women in my

2480
01:40:03,241 --> 01:40:04,830
neighborhood.
I live in Lincoln Equestrian

2481
01:40:04,831 --> 01:40:06,960
neighborhood.
Do you know the Burbank is an equestrian

2482
01:40:06,961 --> 01:40:09,720
neighborhood and didn't know it can be
in Burbank and you'll see fucking people

2483
01:40:09,721 --> 01:40:11,940
walked on the street riding a horse.
That's cool.

2484
01:40:11,970 --> 01:40:13,770
It's weird.
I love petting horses.

2485
01:40:14,010 --> 01:40:15,150
Do you?
They're awesome.

2486
01:40:15,540 --> 01:40:18,120
Fucking great.
They're great animals.

2487
01:40:18,330 --> 01:40:20,700
I like to pet all animals.
I want to go to a sanctuary.

2488
01:40:21,180 --> 01:40:22,920
Um,
I'll be the point with that girl.

2489
01:40:22,950 --> 01:40:24,120
I didn't judge her when she told me
that.

2490
01:40:24,150 --> 01:40:25,770
Like I always a.
I didn't think he was weird.

2491
01:40:25,771 --> 01:40:29,010
I was not my thing at all.
Like I'm not a size queen.

2492
01:40:29,220 --> 01:40:30,240
Yeah,
she sure was.

2493
01:40:30,740 --> 01:40:35,730
She picked the wrong fellow.
Well she probably liked you for some

2494
01:40:35,731 --> 01:40:37,470
parts of you.
I mean that's often the case with

2495
01:40:37,471 --> 01:40:37,951
people,
right?

2496
01:40:37,951 --> 01:40:39,960
Like you like certain aspects but it
doesn't,

2497
01:40:40,230 --> 01:40:42,570
it doesn't go like,
it doesn't all line up,

2498
01:40:42,660 --> 01:40:45,570
but you like a few things.
Like he's got a great sense of humor.

2499
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:47,610
He's fearless.
He's hilarious.

2500
01:40:47,611 --> 01:40:50,640
He says funny shit all the time.
He keeps me entertained,

2501
01:40:51,420 --> 01:40:54,820
but he's fucked a few dudes dresses.
Well she like,

2502
01:40:55,030 --> 01:40:56,320
no,
I would never fuck could do to address.

2503
01:40:56,321 --> 01:40:57,760
That'd be weird.
Only a trans woman.

2504
01:40:57,820 --> 01:41:00,360
There's a difference.
There are Edward was the dude in a

2505
01:41:00,361 --> 01:41:03,580
dress.
How would never fuck Edward Trans woman?

2506
01:41:03,930 --> 01:41:04,651
Yes.
Yeah.

2507
01:41:04,651 --> 01:41:07,980
When you probably like,
did you get excited when people started

2508
01:41:07,981 --> 01:41:10,360
changing the differentiations between
like,

2509
01:41:10,361 --> 01:41:13,170
uh,
like it used to be like a tranny,

2510
01:41:13,460 --> 01:41:16,790
like everybody thought it was a guy.
It's a guy and now it's,

2511
01:41:16,791 --> 01:41:18,200
she,
you know,

2512
01:41:18,201 --> 01:41:20,170
her.
I didn't care what it,

2513
01:41:20,260 --> 01:41:22,160
whatever they,
I thought I felt that we would do is

2514
01:41:22,161 --> 01:41:25,580
probably some of the political correct
shit is so fucking irritating.

2515
01:41:25,790 --> 01:41:27,890
And then there's times where I think
some of it might make sense.

2516
01:41:27,891 --> 01:41:30,710
Not In punishing people but in like just
there is a difference between this

2517
01:41:30,711 --> 01:41:32,990
person and that person.
So some of it it's fine,

2518
01:41:32,991 --> 01:41:33,920
but I don't,
I don't care.

2519
01:41:34,280 --> 01:41:35,780
Whatever they,
whatever people want to be like,

2520
01:41:35,781 --> 01:41:36,800
they won't be with Trent.
Whatever.

2521
01:41:37,220 --> 01:41:37,980
I don't care.
Some,

2522
01:41:37,980 --> 01:41:41,180
some transcripts I've talked to like I'm
a woman and I'm like,

2523
01:41:41,210 --> 01:41:42,770
no,
there's a difference.

2524
01:41:43,360 --> 01:41:44,900
You know,
you're fine,

2525
01:41:45,330 --> 01:41:47,960
you're great who you are,
you don't have to change who you are.

2526
01:41:48,200 --> 01:41:51,320
You don't have to say you're this word
because the judgment of the country is

2527
01:41:52,200 --> 01:41:54,680
pleasant or for that word than it is for
this word,

2528
01:41:54,840 --> 01:41:58,820
but you are who you are,
so you don't just don't say your I,

2529
01:41:58,870 --> 01:42:00,440
I personally just don't look at it that
way.

2530
01:42:00,441 --> 01:42:03,050
But someone who's 20 would tell me on
the fucking transphobic,

2531
01:42:03,160 --> 01:42:05,000
yeah,
I know I'm going to get shanked talk

2532
01:42:05,001 --> 01:42:06,920
about in the special.
I know I'm going to get shit for it,

2533
01:42:06,950 --> 01:42:07,910
but fuck it.
You know,

2534
01:42:08,670 --> 01:42:10,930
if you don't say every word right,
if you,

2535
01:42:10,940 --> 01:42:12,380
you know,
if someone's throwing the mines down and

2536
01:42:12,381 --> 01:42:14,960
you step on one,
you know you get fucked.

2537
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:16,020
Well,
it's the same thing with the.

2538
01:42:16,021 --> 01:42:17,470
We were talking about with the joke
earlier.

2539
01:42:17,770 --> 01:42:20,250
That guy got in trouble for it.
So people are looking to get mad.

2540
01:42:20,540 --> 01:42:23,080
There's,
there's a lot of that when it comes to

2541
01:42:23,081 --> 01:42:25,120
transgender people.
And here's another thing,

2542
01:42:25,121 --> 01:42:27,490
like people will tell you if you're not
trans,

2543
01:42:27,491 --> 01:42:29,200
you shouldn't be talking about trans
issues.

2544
01:42:29,590 --> 01:42:31,330
How about fuck you?
First of all,

2545
01:42:31,331 --> 01:42:35,020
because this is a national global thing
that's going on right now,

2546
01:42:35,440 --> 01:42:37,600
but you should be able to talk about
everything.

2547
01:42:37,750 --> 01:42:38,650
That's my point.
Sure.

2548
01:42:38,680 --> 01:42:43,680
But there are people that definitely for
whatever reason,

2549
01:42:44,320 --> 01:42:49,030
nature,
the universe has thrown them a strange

2550
01:42:49,031 --> 01:42:53,530
set of cards and they really should have
been born a woman and they are a man and

2551
01:42:53,531 --> 01:42:56,560
they identify with being a woman.
They feel much better when they're

2552
01:42:56,561 --> 01:42:59,110
wearing a dress.
They feel much better wearing women's

2553
01:42:59,111 --> 01:42:59,770
clothes.

2554
01:42:59,770 --> 01:43:03,880
They feel much better and I don't think
they should have to get surgery to do

2555
01:43:03,881 --> 01:43:05,020
that.
I don't think you should have to get

2556
01:43:05,021 --> 01:43:05,920
your Dick.
I mean people said,

2557
01:43:05,980 --> 01:43:07,720
Melissa,
get your coat off or not a woman.

2558
01:43:08,450 --> 01:43:13,110
I don't agree with that.
I feel like if you were a woman and and

2559
01:43:13,300 --> 01:43:15,640
you know,
quote unquote trapped inside a man's

2560
01:43:15,641 --> 01:43:20,570
body and someone told you that you had
to get surgery to appear whole and

2561
01:43:20,571 --> 01:43:23,170
that's the only way you could ever be
thought of as a woman,

2562
01:43:23,171 --> 01:43:24,850
but you didn't want to get surgery.
Like,

2563
01:43:24,851 --> 01:43:26,350
whoa,
that's crazy.

2564
01:43:26,351 --> 01:43:31,351
Like those rules are just as crazy as
any other bizarre restrictions that we

2565
01:43:31,451 --> 01:43:34,570
put on people.
So there are those people in the world,

2566
01:43:34,600 --> 01:43:37,360
but then there are also people that are
insane.

2567
01:43:37,660 --> 01:43:38,493
Yes,

2568
01:43:38,500 --> 01:43:39,850
sure.
There's plenty of that.

2569
01:43:39,970 --> 01:43:42,010
People who think they know who they are,
what they want,

2570
01:43:42,011 --> 01:43:44,560
but they're wrong.
I've asked that surgery question a lot.

2571
01:43:44,950 --> 01:43:46,690
I'll ask like,
do you want,

2572
01:43:46,930 --> 01:43:49,270
why do you want.
If you want to get this srs,

2573
01:43:51,260 --> 01:43:53,480
sexual risk manager,
and I'm genuinely curious.

2574
01:43:53,481 --> 01:43:54,540
I'm going to ask you to be like,
oh,

2575
01:43:55,280 --> 01:43:58,040
everybody would know what that meant.
It deep into the world.

2576
01:43:58,650 --> 01:44:02,930
In my world that's old hat.
It's like human resources are going to

2577
01:44:02,931 --> 01:44:05,130
go talk to her.
Yeah.

2578
01:44:05,260 --> 01:44:07,160
I forget sometimes.
CIA,

2579
01:44:07,161 --> 01:44:08,720
FBI,
srs.

2580
01:44:09,410 --> 01:44:11,330
I poked my head out the fucking cave
once in a while.

2581
01:44:11,331 --> 01:44:11,781
I'm like,
really?

2582
01:44:11,781 --> 01:44:13,760
Everybody isn't talking about this guy.
Go,

2583
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:15,830
sorry.
I've asked about it and I'm like

2584
01:44:15,860 --> 01:44:17,720
without.
I'm genuinely curious to what you say.

2585
01:44:17,721 --> 01:44:19,360
Like I don't know the answer to it.
So I'm like,

2586
01:44:19,361 --> 01:44:20,420
do you what?
Do you want it?

2587
01:44:20,420 --> 01:44:23,510
And sometimes the answer is like,
I think it will feel better and that's

2588
01:44:23,511 --> 01:44:25,080
one thing.
And then other girls as well,

2589
01:44:25,120 --> 01:44:26,390
this way I can go swimming.
And I'm like,

2590
01:44:26,391 --> 01:44:29,570
but those were all outside things.
Other people's judgment.

2591
01:44:29,830 --> 01:44:34,370
That's not like I feel a certain way
that's other people will look at me more

2592
01:44:34,371 --> 01:44:36,290
this way.
So that's a dangerous thing I think.

2593
01:44:36,620 --> 01:44:38,990
But if it's going to feel better and
this is how I want it to be,

2594
01:44:38,991 --> 01:44:40,880
that's the one thing.
And they can't come though.

2595
01:44:40,910 --> 01:44:42,680
That's the other thing.
There's no orgasms,

2596
01:44:42,681 --> 01:44:43,514
right?
I don't know.

2597
01:44:43,630 --> 01:44:46,340
I your Dick removed.
I'm pretty sure the orgasms are done.

2598
01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:47,900
I've heard,
I've heard different answers from

2599
01:44:47,901 --> 01:44:49,250
different people.
So I,

2600
01:44:49,251 --> 01:44:50,360
I just,
I don't know the answer.

2601
01:44:50,440 --> 01:44:54,230
I was in a funny that that's terrifying
to people as a thought to no longer be

2602
01:44:54,231 --> 01:44:55,110
able to have orgasms.

2603
01:44:55,310 --> 01:44:57,500
How many orgasms even having a week.
You know what I mean?

2604
01:44:57,530 --> 01:44:59,920
If you have like four or five orgasms a
week,

2605
01:45:00,040 --> 01:45:01,280
whoa,
there's not that many,

2606
01:45:01,281 --> 01:45:04,550
but not considering the 24 hours in a
day.

2607
01:45:04,551 --> 01:45:08,960
All the moments in a day.
The few moments that 30 slash 40 seconds

2608
01:45:13,490 --> 01:45:15,680
that's so important to people to lead up
to.

2609
01:45:15,681 --> 01:45:18,170
It's fun though.
Like I liked it that I get addicted to

2610
01:45:18,171 --> 01:45:20,230
the lead up and that's what you can keep
going for awhile.

2611
01:45:20,400 --> 01:45:23,540
You were the first person to tell me but
edging but edging.

2612
01:45:23,590 --> 01:45:24,500
Oh yeah.
It's great.

2613
01:45:24,590 --> 01:45:27,050
I never heard about that,
but we would get close and then stop,

2614
01:45:27,090 --> 01:45:28,820
get close and then stopped.
Awful.

2615
01:45:28,850 --> 01:45:30,800
It really is.
I wish I didn't do it because then sex

2616
01:45:30,801 --> 01:45:32,630
becomes this weird thing,
but uh,

2617
01:45:32,631 --> 01:45:35,450
you know,
I got addicted to doing that when I

2618
01:45:35,451 --> 01:45:38,600
don't do it for a while,
then I just kind of feel normal now.

2619
01:45:38,690 --> 01:45:41,660
When you do a show like this and you get
real open about this kind of stuff,

2620
01:45:41,900 --> 01:45:44,300
do you get a bunch of freaky chicks just
start bawling?

2621
01:45:44,640 --> 01:45:46,040
I think because again,
with,

2622
01:45:46,041 --> 01:45:46,650
with,
with,

2623
01:45:46,650 --> 01:45:48,520
with,
with on the radio show in the morning,

2624
01:45:48,530 --> 01:45:52,340
there's enough people who have,
who known me or it's not surprising to

2625
01:45:52,341 --> 01:45:54,740
anybody.
I don't fucking.

2626
01:45:54,810 --> 01:45:58,010
I was talking to this girl on instagram
and she was,

2627
01:45:58,011 --> 01:45:59,780
uh,
she was trans and I was following her

2628
01:45:59,781 --> 01:46:03,170
and she wrote me this,
this a private message and she's like,

2629
01:46:03,171 --> 01:46:04,790
I didn't even know who you are.
I had to look you up.

2630
01:46:05,210 --> 01:46:05,871
Which is weird.
Like,

2631
01:46:05,871 --> 01:46:06,390
all right,
fine.

2632
01:46:06,390 --> 01:46:07,910
I didn't say,
hey look,

2633
01:46:07,911 --> 01:46:11,030
it's me can,
I'll shoot you down a little bit for no

2634
01:46:11,031 --> 01:46:11,980
reason.
I didn't do anything to it.

2635
01:46:12,020 --> 01:46:13,370
That's natural.
And then she's like,

2636
01:46:13,371 --> 01:46:17,390
that bit you did on strap on is very
disrespectful to trans.

2637
01:46:17,420 --> 01:46:18,620
I'm like,
Oh,

2638
01:46:18,710 --> 01:46:22,640
first of all too true story.
You think I'm proud of the fact that a

2639
01:46:22,641 --> 01:46:25,400
fucking I cut.
I just two different strap on stories I

2640
01:46:25,401 --> 01:46:28,640
have and I've told them both and
specialist at both trope and I'm like,

2641
01:46:28,641 --> 01:46:29,720
they're not,
they're true stories.

2642
01:46:29,721 --> 01:46:31,490
It's like you're trying to act like you
don't like trans girls,

2643
01:46:31,491 --> 01:46:33,500
but it's obvious you do.
And I'm just like,

2644
01:46:33,530 --> 01:46:35,240
oh,
you fucking dope.

2645
01:46:35,360 --> 01:46:37,130
You not reading the situation.
Right?

2646
01:46:37,131 --> 01:46:38,180
Of course,
you know,

2647
01:46:38,181 --> 01:46:41,520
no one thinks I don't know one.
And I'm like,

2648
01:46:41,560 --> 01:46:44,780
I sent her an interview from vice where
I talk about it and then she blocked me.

2649
01:46:45,520 --> 01:46:46,560
He blocked her.
She did.

2650
01:46:46,580 --> 01:46:49,300
Nobody wants to be wrong.
She like an idiot.

2651
01:46:49,520 --> 01:46:50,070
She was just trying

2652
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:52,890
to get mad at you for no reason.
And she'd want to be proven wrong.

2653
01:46:52,920 --> 01:46:55,050
People are so stupid.
They get mad.

2654
01:46:55,080 --> 01:46:56,700
They liked to get mad.
They get mad.

2655
01:46:56,701 --> 01:46:59,910
Just like you were talking about,
you were addicted to causing these

2656
01:46:59,911 --> 01:47:03,570
situations.
I'm a twitter troll and a relationship.

2657
01:47:06,220 --> 01:47:08,670
That is what it is,
right?

2658
01:47:08,671 --> 01:47:10,950
Yes.
I'm addicted to that feeling.

2659
01:47:10,951 --> 01:47:14,820
I'm addicted to that.
That rush and that high.

2660
01:47:14,850 --> 01:47:18,060
That's exactly what I do.
Isn't it funny that the president is

2661
01:47:18,061 --> 01:47:20,010
twitter as a twitter troll?
Oh my God.

2662
01:47:20,011 --> 01:47:21,810
Yes.
And it's a twitter troll and I don't

2663
01:47:21,811 --> 01:47:24,060
even say whatever you want about him.
I don't hate him,

2664
01:47:24,061 --> 01:47:26,610
but his twitter and as embarrassing,
he's got to stop.

2665
01:47:27,630 --> 01:47:29,820
He's a legit twitter,
twitter troll.

2666
01:47:30,060 --> 01:47:32,100
Weird word to say 10 times.
But twitter,

2667
01:47:32,280 --> 01:47:32,821
twitter,
troll,

2668
01:47:32,821 --> 01:47:33,654
twitter troll.
Yeah.

2669
01:47:34,380 --> 01:47:34,981
Really?
Uh,

2670
01:47:34,981 --> 01:47:36,570
he is an odd,
odd duck.

2671
01:47:36,630 --> 01:47:37,463
He's a troll.

2672
01:47:37,470 --> 01:47:39,210
He likes to troll.
I mean,

2673
01:47:39,420 --> 01:47:42,330
him and Rosie O'donnell still go at it
almost every day,

2674
01:47:42,570 --> 01:47:46,020
or at least rosie goes out.
It srosy backed off for a long time,

2675
01:47:46,021 --> 01:47:48,390
but now that he's president,
didn't she back off when he said he was

2676
01:47:48,391 --> 01:47:50,460
going to sue works?
I think she had said he was broke or he

2677
01:47:50,461 --> 01:47:52,680
went back.
She said something which technically,

2678
01:47:53,070 --> 01:47:55,800
and you don't want to have to litigate
with a guy with a billion dollars.

2679
01:47:55,801 --> 01:47:57,090
I mean,
that's a frightening proposition.

2680
01:47:57,091 --> 01:47:59,250
I think she apologized on the view or if
I was wrong,

2681
01:47:59,850 --> 01:48:01,710
which is probably a smart move.
Well,

2682
01:48:01,711 --> 01:48:06,300
that was when she started mocking him on
the view because he had done this thing

2683
01:48:06,750 --> 01:48:09,810
where the Miss Usa.
Which one does he own?

2684
01:48:09,811 --> 01:48:11,210
Miss Universe.
I don't remember.

2685
01:48:11,520 --> 01:48:16,020
He owns one of them and he had made some
sort of distinction that the woman,

2686
01:48:16,500 --> 01:48:20,460
I forget the specifics,
but she had done something inappropriate

2687
01:48:20,461 --> 01:48:24,600
or what he deemed inappropriate and she
was getting her crown removed or

2688
01:48:24,601 --> 01:48:25,410
something like that.

2689
01:48:25,410 --> 01:48:29,550
So Rosie O'donnell was mocking him and
she's mocking his hair and the way he

2690
01:48:29,580 --> 01:48:33,870
behaves and the whole deal and she went
on this long rant about him on the view

2691
01:48:34,620 --> 01:48:38,580
and then he went on Letterman and shit
all over her and then they went back and

2692
01:48:38,581 --> 01:48:43,581
forth and back and forth.
And then I saw she made a poem because

2693
01:48:43,831 --> 01:48:48,330
he had mocked her during the debates.
Like when one of the things that drove

2694
01:48:48,331 --> 01:48:52,340
me crazy,
because I'm a.

2695
01:48:53,130 --> 01:48:54,720
When Hillary Clinton was debating him,
she said,

2696
01:48:54,870 --> 01:48:58,230
you have said this about women,
you know the women in this woman's a pig

2697
01:48:58,231 --> 01:48:58,951
and a sweatshirt.
Okay.

2698
01:48:58,951 --> 01:49:01,080
But about which one?
Like,

2699
01:49:01,220 --> 01:49:03,390
well you can't say women overall in
general.

2700
01:49:03,560 --> 01:49:05,080
She knew what she was doing.
She was,

2701
01:49:05,310 --> 01:49:08,160
she was trying to find like this hot
button issue.

2702
01:49:08,430 --> 01:49:09,061
And he's like,
well,

2703
01:49:09,061 --> 01:49:10,530
you know my center about Rosie
O'donnell.

2704
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:12,930
And so she was devastated by that.

2705
01:49:13,010 --> 01:49:18,010
She was watching it at home and wrote a
whole poem about the sadness creeping

2706
01:49:18,061 --> 01:49:20,190
in,
how it was bothering her and the whole

2707
01:49:20,191 --> 01:49:22,350
deal.
But now she like kind of bates him,

2708
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:25,020
like he,
he made a post yesterday about all the

2709
01:49:25,021 --> 01:49:26,730
jobs that have been created and erode
jobs,

2710
01:49:26,731 --> 01:49:27,564
jobs,
jobs,

2711
01:49:27,690 --> 01:49:29,850
and she retweeted it,
quote,

2712
01:49:29,851 --> 01:49:31,980
tweeted it and said trees and trees and
trees.

2713
01:49:32,010 --> 01:49:33,450
And I'm like,
all right.

2714
01:49:33,590 --> 01:49:35,160
Yeah.
People really don't have set this one.

2715
01:49:35,280 --> 01:49:35,970
I'm in jail.
I'm like,

2716
01:49:35,970 --> 01:49:37,890
I love being alive.
I love watching it.

2717
01:49:38,120 --> 01:49:39,030
It's fascinating.
Love it.

2718
01:49:39,031 --> 01:49:40,890
It's fun.
It's all these protests.

2719
01:49:40,970 --> 01:49:42,720
Yeah.
Get in front of the trump towers and

2720
01:49:42,721 --> 01:49:45,000
fucking scream.
I know in our studio is not far from

2721
01:49:45,001 --> 01:49:46,790
there.
So when the Uber driver decides to go up

2722
01:49:46,830 --> 01:49:49,180
first avenue,
I normally hit traffic crossing town.

2723
01:49:49,290 --> 01:49:49,961
It's like,
hey dummy.

2724
01:49:49,961 --> 01:49:50,794
Go Up the other way.

2725
01:49:50,830 --> 01:49:52,380
It's recreational outrage.
Yeah.

2726
01:49:52,390 --> 01:49:54,720
I think so many people that are out
there in front of his building.

2727
01:49:54,950 --> 01:49:58,630
The hotel in your hotel at UFC $200.
Phone.

2728
01:49:59,640 --> 01:50:01,540
We had to walk home.
Fuck,

2729
01:50:01,541 --> 01:50:02,950
that was married.
That was fun.

2730
01:50:03,160 --> 01:50:06,430
Yeah.
We walked from my hotel all the way to

2731
01:50:06,431 --> 01:50:10,170
the UFC because we could not get a
fucking car to take us.

2732
01:50:10,171 --> 01:50:13,390
There was no car,
so I had to put a hood on and just

2733
01:50:13,391 --> 01:50:17,110
fucking barrel down and just plow
through other people and then when we

2734
01:50:17,111 --> 01:50:18,570
started getting close to mass square
guard,

2735
01:50:18,580 --> 01:50:21,090
it started getting a little crazy
because people recognize us.

2736
01:50:21,100 --> 01:50:22,300
It was getting a little squirrel.
You.

2737
01:50:22,301 --> 01:50:23,410
Yeah.
For you it's very hard,

2738
01:50:23,411 --> 01:50:25,870
but you,
you walked very purposeful purposefully.

2739
01:50:25,871 --> 01:50:26,381
You know,
you have a,

2740
01:50:26,381 --> 01:50:28,100
you have a way of getting in and out,
uh,

2741
01:50:28,270 --> 01:50:29,980
because you got to.
If you stopped going to be a fucking

2742
01:50:29,981 --> 01:50:31,360
fight,
you gotta tell people you can't stop

2743
01:50:31,710 --> 01:50:32,350
people that came in.

2744
01:50:32,350 --> 01:50:33,670
I take a picture.
Hold on a second,

2745
01:50:33,671 --> 01:50:34,570
hold on.
Let me get back picture.

2746
01:50:34,571 --> 01:50:36,510
And they can't do it.
Stop.

2747
01:50:36,580 --> 01:50:38,770
Can't stop.
There's 50,000 people on the street.

2748
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:40,810
There's no way I could stop if I stop
them fucked.

2749
01:50:40,870 --> 01:50:41,810
Yeah.
Yeah.

2750
01:50:41,830 --> 01:50:43,570
I've seen it.
Take one comes over.

2751
01:50:43,571 --> 01:50:45,790
Then it's just two minutes.
But it was this feeling in the air too.

2752
01:50:45,791 --> 01:50:48,190
It was just such a weird feeling.
It's like it was almost festive.

2753
01:50:48,520 --> 01:50:50,530
Like people were festive in there
protesting.

2754
01:50:50,730 --> 01:50:52,150
It's almost,
they're giddy excited.

2755
01:50:52,330 --> 01:50:54,940
We're together.
Fuck him.

2756
01:50:54,941 --> 01:50:56,380
But meanwhile,
you're not doing anything,

2757
01:50:56,381 --> 01:50:58,810
you're just yelling and you know this
one guy,

2758
01:50:58,870 --> 01:51:00,970
I've told this story before,
but it was just so bizarre because he

2759
01:51:00,971 --> 01:51:04,420
was screaming out,
Donald Trump KKK,

2760
01:51:04,540 --> 01:51:05,710
racist,
sexist,

2761
01:51:05,730 --> 01:51:07,870
anti gay.
He had this whole thing that he was

2762
01:51:07,871 --> 01:51:10,810
screaming out and then he sees these
black guys walking towards him and he

2763
01:51:10,811 --> 01:51:13,900
starts yelling out black lives matter.
Black lives matter.

2764
01:51:14,020 --> 01:51:15,490
He changed his rant.

2765
01:51:17,610 --> 01:51:20,760
Fucking Douche bag.
So gross.

2766
01:51:21,160 --> 01:51:23,950
He was such a,
such a thin boned,

2767
01:51:23,951 --> 01:51:27,400
liberal,
such as the kind of guy who would cry if

2768
01:51:27,401 --> 01:51:29,020
it was,
if they were camping and they ran out of

2769
01:51:29,021 --> 01:51:31,390
water.
Just that guy.

2770
01:51:31,930 --> 01:51:32,950
Frail.
Nice.

2771
01:51:33,580 --> 01:51:35,620
He was so frail.
He was not just frail.

2772
01:51:35,621 --> 01:51:37,780
He was just everything about it though.
The hole,

2773
01:51:37,900 --> 01:51:39,220
the chant,
you know.

2774
01:51:39,221 --> 01:51:41,650
First of all,
this whole racist,

2775
01:51:41,651 --> 01:51:42,890
sexist,
anti gay.

2776
01:51:43,570 --> 01:51:45,580
Let's just start with anti gay.
Like where?

2777
01:51:45,610 --> 01:51:47,290
Where's the evidence?
Are you sure?

2778
01:51:47,291 --> 01:51:49,210
He's anti gang.
Like what has he done?

2779
01:51:49,650 --> 01:51:51,190
Really?
I don't think he cares.

2780
01:51:51,490 --> 01:51:53,710
I don't think he does either.
It's unless it's making him money or

2781
01:51:53,711 --> 01:51:58,570
losing money.
There was the thing about people trans

2782
01:51:58,630 --> 01:52:03,400
rights to be able to use the restroom
that they identify with,

2783
01:52:03,640 --> 01:52:06,460
you know,
that that was a hot button subjects and

2784
01:52:06,461 --> 01:52:11,461
there was actual government support for
people to use the bathroom that they

2785
01:52:11,951 --> 01:52:12,880
identify with.

2786
01:52:12,880 --> 01:52:15,630
And boy that is a tricky one.
That's when I,

2787
01:52:15,640 --> 01:52:16,960
I'm not sure if either,
you know,

2788
01:52:17,020 --> 01:52:19,690
I feel like that one,
there almost should be three bathrooms.

2789
01:52:19,740 --> 01:52:21,820
Yeah.
Like male,

2790
01:52:21,880 --> 01:52:24,170
female and who gives a fuck?
Yeah.

2791
01:52:24,380 --> 01:52:26,790
We're pull up,
put them all in when you can have them

2792
01:52:26,791 --> 01:52:28,780
all as single bathrooms,
gender neutral,

2793
01:52:28,840 --> 01:52:29,673
neutral.
That's fine.

2794
01:52:29,920 --> 01:52:33,160
But then businesses go yet we have men
and a women's room and it's like we just

2795
01:52:33,161 --> 01:52:36,640
established he's in the bathroom now
what you want us to pay $100,000 to have

2796
01:52:36,641 --> 01:52:37,610
a new bathroom.
Put it like.

2797
01:52:37,720 --> 01:52:39,610
And there were people that were
arrested.

2798
01:52:39,611 --> 01:52:42,610
A few guys who were arrested for saying
they were transgender and they were

2799
01:52:42,890 --> 01:52:45,570
sleeping and taking pictures of women.
You know,

2800
01:52:45,571 --> 01:52:49,010
it's like there are creeps out there and
that's that scary.

2801
01:52:49,070 --> 01:52:49,580
Yeah.
I mean,

2802
01:52:49,580 --> 01:52:53,150
and then people say in rightly so will
those creeps should be punished on an

2803
01:52:53,151 --> 01:52:53,990
individual basis.

2804
01:52:54,230 --> 01:52:55,680
Right,
but that,

2805
01:52:55,780 --> 01:53:00,050
that puts that up to law enforcement and
then you have to have more resources to

2806
01:53:00,051 --> 01:53:03,410
make sure that these guys aren't doing
that creeping around and female

2807
01:53:03,411 --> 01:53:05,630
bathrooms and pretending to be
transgender.

2808
01:53:05,631 --> 01:53:07,010
It's like,
man,

2809
01:53:07,011 --> 01:53:09,140
when you,
when you have an opening for creeps,

2810
01:53:09,260 --> 01:53:12,740
they're gonna find their way through
those cracks and that does not

2811
01:53:12,741 --> 01:53:14,540
necessarily saying that because of
creeps,

2812
01:53:14,720 --> 01:53:18,630
you should punish transgender people,
but I want to.

2813
01:53:18,660 --> 01:53:21,500
I'm not sure of the answer to that.
I just don't know the answer.

2814
01:53:21,501 --> 01:53:23,470
Like I,
I don't like the law that they made was

2815
01:53:23,490 --> 01:53:24,770
North Carolina.
It's a little shitty,

2816
01:53:25,040 --> 01:53:26,840
but I do.
It was the law in North Carolina.

2817
01:53:26,841 --> 01:53:29,600
They just said basically you have to use
the men,

2818
01:53:29,620 --> 01:53:31,430
men and men.
They just said you can't do whatever is

2819
01:53:31,431 --> 01:53:32,370
on your birth certificate.
Right?

2820
01:53:32,371 --> 01:53:34,520
Yes.
And get that changed.

2821
01:53:34,670 --> 01:53:36,320
I think you can get your birth
certificate changed.

2822
01:53:36,610 --> 01:53:38,510
That I don't know.
I don't know the answer to that.

2823
01:53:38,910 --> 01:53:40,940
If you can,
can you get the gender on your birth

2824
01:53:40,941 --> 01:53:43,880
certificate changed Google that I think
you can.

2825
01:53:44,100 --> 01:53:47,540
Maybe I think you can,
but as there a legit complaint,

2826
01:53:48,130 --> 01:53:51,470
like if women are in the locker room and
someone is legitimately trans,

2827
01:53:51,860 --> 01:53:53,540
is it,
is it odd for them to see somebody

2828
01:53:53,541 --> 01:53:56,450
walking around with car like I could get
with that would be weird and without

2829
01:53:56,451 --> 01:53:58,640
being transphobic,
it's just not something you expect to

2830
01:53:58,641 --> 01:53:59,170
see.
In the lady room.

2831
01:53:59,170 --> 01:54:02,500
The majority of states permit the name
and says to be changed on a birth

2832
01:54:02,510 --> 01:54:05,930
certificate either through amending
existing birth certificate or by issuing

2833
01:54:05,931 --> 01:54:07,220
a new one.
Many states,

2834
01:54:07,221 --> 01:54:10,340
however,
require medical proof of sterilization

2835
01:54:10,341 --> 01:54:15,341
by sex reassignment surgery.
What proof of sterilization?

2836
01:54:16,130 --> 01:54:20,270
Sex reassignment surgery in order to
warrant a gender marker change.

2837
01:54:20,540 --> 01:54:21,373
That's a weird.

2838
01:54:21,520 --> 01:54:23,360
Yeah.
You got to get surgery for the state to

2839
01:54:23,361 --> 01:54:26,540
agree with you,
but not just that sterilization well

2840
01:54:26,550 --> 01:54:29,120
bisects your sterilized by the
reassignments.

2841
01:54:29,240 --> 01:54:31,640
I know,
but that's a weird way is describing in

2842
01:54:31,641 --> 01:54:32,960
many states,
however,

2843
01:54:32,961 --> 01:54:35,900
require medical proof of sterilization
because guess what?

2844
01:54:36,050 --> 01:54:38,540
Female to male does not make you
sterile.

2845
01:54:38,950 --> 01:54:42,410
Like when when women start taking a male
hormones,

2846
01:54:42,430 --> 01:54:45,350
like there was a one where there's this
guy with a beard and he was

2847
01:54:45,380 --> 01:54:47,390
breastfeeding.
It was crazy.

2848
01:54:47,420 --> 01:54:49,310
Oh yeah,
got pregnant,

2849
01:54:49,640 --> 01:54:52,460
gave birth and was breastfeeding and
then people were saying,

2850
01:54:52,461 --> 01:54:54,350
well what kind of,
what does this kid getting?

2851
01:54:54,860 --> 01:54:55,910
Like what?
What's going on?

2852
01:54:55,911 --> 01:54:59,720
And I mean this guy's taking exogenous
hormones and this kid is sucking on his

2853
01:54:59,721 --> 01:55:00,500
tits.
Like,

2854
01:55:00,500 --> 01:55:01,251
yeah,
I wonder.

2855
01:55:01,251 --> 01:55:02,870
I don't know,
maybe it's maybe it's not bad for the

2856
01:55:02,871 --> 01:55:04,760
baby or maybe stopped.
I have no idea.

2857
01:55:05,110 --> 01:55:07,910
It gets a little dicey and you know,
like there's this big hits in the

2858
01:55:07,911 --> 01:55:09,080
country,
but it's like other people if say,

2859
01:55:09,130 --> 01:55:10,010
all right,
we're trying,

2860
01:55:10,600 --> 01:55:11,890
we're not everyone's.

2861
01:55:12,140 --> 01:55:14,510
This is a tricky one.
People are just trying to learn what it

2862
01:55:14,511 --> 01:55:16,910
is and get used to it.
And Science is not even 100 percent.

2863
01:55:16,911 --> 01:55:20,330
So give people some fucking time to
adjust.

2864
01:55:20,340 --> 01:55:23,450
Like everyone who's not 100 percent on
board is not trans phobic.

2865
01:55:23,690 --> 01:55:25,460
Some people are,
some people who are learning to

2866
01:55:25,461 --> 01:55:27,740
differentiate that just because a guy
says tranny,

2867
01:55:27,741 --> 01:55:29,870
sometimes they're not true doesn't mean
he hates transpeople.

2868
01:55:29,960 --> 01:55:31,970
Who's transphobic?
Learn the difference when you're

2869
01:55:31,971 --> 01:55:33,420
labeling everyone who is not 100 percent
onboard,

2870
01:55:33,530 --> 01:55:35,690
transphobic.
You lose so many people who would be on

2871
01:55:35,691 --> 01:55:36,411
your site.
Well,

2872
01:55:36,411 --> 01:55:39,560
I think like many things with human
beings,

2873
01:55:39,620 --> 01:55:43,010
people are messy.
This is messy realities to all of.

2874
01:55:43,560 --> 01:55:46,980
And I think that's what's going on with
the whole transgender issue too.

2875
01:55:47,310 --> 01:55:48,180
You know what I mean?
That's.

2876
01:55:48,540 --> 01:55:50,310
People are messy,
you know,

2877
01:55:50,370 --> 01:55:52,860
it's just the whole thing is we were
weird,

2878
01:55:52,861 --> 01:55:53,390
man.

2879
01:55:53,390 --> 01:55:58,110
We're everything about us is weird from
education to marriage to gender

2880
01:55:58,111 --> 01:56:03,111
relations to the roles that we choose.
Like there was some fucking tweet that I

2881
01:56:03,181 --> 01:56:05,890
saw today.
Um,

2882
01:56:06,120 --> 01:56:08,100
oh,
smashing social justice.

2883
01:56:08,160 --> 01:56:11,820
This is what it was.
Go go to smashing social justice on

2884
01:56:11,821 --> 01:56:15,300
instagram and this is like this.
It just shows how bizarre the way people

2885
01:56:15,301 --> 01:56:18,000
think.
There was a line in front of the women's

2886
01:56:18,001 --> 01:56:20,670
room and no line in front of the men's
room.

2887
01:56:20,940 --> 01:56:25,110
And I think the quote was,
I'm more subtle.

2888
01:56:25,140 --> 01:56:28,680
Patriarchy bullshit law.
Twenty minute line in front of the

2889
01:56:28,681 --> 01:56:30,840
women's room.
No line in front of the men's room.

2890
01:56:30,990 --> 01:56:31,500
Like,
no,

2891
01:56:31,500 --> 01:56:34,080
that does nothing to do with the
patriarchy.

2892
01:56:34,380 --> 01:56:38,310
That has to do with women need an
individual stall.

2893
01:56:38,460 --> 01:56:42,420
It requires more,
more space.

2894
01:56:43,050 --> 01:56:44,970
Oh No.
Account accounts private.

2895
01:56:44,971 --> 01:56:46,140
It's a private.
Oh Wow.

2896
01:56:46,200 --> 01:56:47,033
Weird.

2897
01:56:47,440 --> 01:56:51,190
They're probably getting a request
request to join you.

2898
01:56:51,191 --> 01:56:53,380
Fuck,
you got locked out.

2899
01:56:53,381 --> 01:56:55,210
What?
I'm not logged in on this.

2900
01:56:55,500 --> 01:56:56,091
Oh,
okay.

2901
01:56:56,091 --> 01:56:56,924
Okay.
Okay.

2902
01:56:56,980 --> 01:56:58,810
That's interesting though,
that it's a private account.

2903
01:56:58,811 --> 01:57:01,030
Must Be.
They get hated on by people.

2904
01:57:01,090 --> 01:57:02,380
That's funny.
Yeah.

2905
01:57:02,381 --> 01:57:03,420
I don't.
I tend not to.

2906
01:57:03,421 --> 01:57:06,850
It's funny on twitter,
even when I've seen a few really

2907
01:57:06,850 --> 01:57:09,160
annoying things in the last month or so
and,

2908
01:57:09,220 --> 01:57:11,590
and uh,
they're not at mentioning me and I'm not

2909
01:57:11,591 --> 01:57:12,940
following them,
so I don't address it.

2910
01:57:13,050 --> 01:57:15,280
They're not talking to me.
I kind of practiced what I've always

2911
01:57:15,281 --> 01:57:16,720
preached.
Like if I'm not,

2912
01:57:16,750 --> 01:57:18,610
if you're not following me,
go fuck yourself.

2913
01:57:18,611 --> 01:57:21,190
I'm not talking to you.
Well this people that will say mean shit

2914
01:57:21,191 --> 01:57:22,870
to you that aren't following you.
Oh yeah,

2915
01:57:22,871 --> 01:57:25,150
yeah.
Try to get your attention.

2916
01:57:25,151 --> 01:57:27,060
But what,
who are those people?

2917
01:57:27,061 --> 01:57:29,770
Like why would anybody,
unless you've done something egregious

2918
01:57:30,010 --> 01:57:33,010
or you've put something out,
like say like if you wrote a book and

2919
01:57:33,011 --> 01:57:35,140
you're like,
trans people should all be shot and make

2920
01:57:35,141 --> 01:57:35,974
the world a lot.

2921
01:57:36,610 --> 01:57:40,150
That's something that someone should
address and them to doing that and

2922
01:57:40,151 --> 01:57:41,920
making a big deal out of it makes a lot
of sense.

2923
01:57:42,310 --> 01:57:43,270
Putting their foot down.
But,

2924
01:57:43,990 --> 01:57:45,430
but again,
it's like what we're talking about with

2925
01:57:45,431 --> 01:57:49,890
that guy and the joke like pe people are
not necessarily making points that are

2926
01:57:49,891 --> 01:57:53,440
just looking to be offended.
Recreational outrage.

2927
01:57:53,500 --> 01:57:54,070
Yeah.
Like,

2928
01:57:54,070 --> 01:57:56,530
like,
like a dumb guy laying there on his side

2929
01:57:56,920 --> 01:57:58,390
saying,
so you're saying that there's cock was

2930
01:57:58,391 --> 01:58:00,380
bigger.
So you liked having sex with him?

2931
01:58:00,400 --> 01:58:05,090
I would walk them to the logical steps
just to get them to say paint.

2932
01:58:05,200 --> 01:58:08,400
That's all I would lie on your side.
Oh yeah.

2933
01:58:08,420 --> 01:58:10,960
So we were in bed.
I remember being in bed with one girl in

2934
01:58:10,961 --> 01:58:14,050
particular,
unless I just discussing it in Florida.

2935
01:58:14,500 --> 01:58:17,800
Literally posting.
Do you ever see the clip of.

2936
01:58:17,890 --> 01:58:19,830
And this is where trump was not media
savvy enough,

2937
01:58:19,831 --> 01:58:21,730
or Chris Matthews,
I think it was painted into a corner

2938
01:58:21,731 --> 01:58:23,950
about abortion.
So should they be punished for having

2939
01:58:24,250 --> 01:58:27,070
like he just didn't.
He's a smart dude and he just did a real

2940
01:58:27,130 --> 01:58:31,090
media savvy guy thing that trump is a
non politician,

2941
01:58:31,100 --> 01:58:32,920
wasn't,
didn't give a very good answer to which

2942
01:58:32,921 --> 01:58:36,130
was about abortion being illegal and he
logically walked him into a corner and

2943
01:58:36,131 --> 01:58:39,580
then trump had to go the like the only
answer was he had to put him in jail.

2944
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,070
So that's what I would do to.
But just to get them

2945
01:58:42,070 --> 01:58:45,520
to say bad shit on a fucking idiot.
Did you see that one reporter that

2946
01:58:45,550 --> 01:58:49,090
backed him into a corner when it came to
the amount of electoral votes?

2947
01:58:49,091 --> 01:58:51,820
Like how big his electoral victory was?
I do not.

2948
01:58:51,821 --> 01:58:53,380
I don't know.
He was.

2949
01:58:53,620 --> 01:58:55,990
He was doing this thing that he does
where he brags,

2950
01:58:56,410 --> 01:58:59,530
which he's a braggadocious man,
but you can't do that once you're the

2951
01:58:59,531 --> 01:59:02,470
fucking president.
It's got to change your ways and you try

2952
01:59:02,471 --> 01:59:04,960
to stop freewheeling.
He free wheels up there.

2953
01:59:04,970 --> 01:59:05,691
It does.
And you,

2954
01:59:05,691 --> 01:59:07,840
you get,
you tie yourself up in knots and all the

2955
01:59:07,841 --> 01:59:09,910
shit that he was allowed to get away
with his whole life.

2956
01:59:10,210 --> 01:59:14,410
Now those become a liability and he was
just talking about the electoral college

2957
01:59:14,411 --> 01:59:16,120
victory.
And this guy said,

2958
01:59:16,121 --> 01:59:18,910
you said that you won by the largest
margin history.

2959
01:59:18,911 --> 01:59:20,200
In fact,
that's not the case.

2960
01:59:20,560 --> 01:59:21,281
And then he goes,
well,

2961
01:59:21,281 --> 01:59:22,300
I meant by Republicans.

2962
01:59:22,300 --> 01:59:23,160
And then he,
he,

2963
01:59:23,200 --> 01:59:24,880
he says by Barack Obama.
And then he says,

2964
01:59:24,881 --> 01:59:26,240
well,
George Herbert Walker,

2965
01:59:26,241 --> 01:59:29,020
Bush,
Bush won by a far larger margin than

2966
01:59:29,080 --> 01:59:30,430
Obama won.
He says that.

2967
01:59:30,431 --> 01:59:31,264
And he's like,
well,

2968
01:59:31,270 --> 01:59:32,770
you will agree though that,
uh,

2969
01:59:32,980 --> 01:59:35,530
I won by a substantial number.
He just can't say he's wrong.

2970
01:59:35,531 --> 01:59:37,390
I did see that the guy was standing up
at the press conference.

2971
01:59:37,640 --> 01:59:39,220
He had a guy and he goes,
I said,

2972
01:59:39,221 --> 01:59:42,130
people told me that you can't just
sometimes you just got to go.

2973
01:59:42,131 --> 01:59:43,330
I was wrong.
Yeah.

2974
01:59:43,360 --> 01:59:45,460
People don't mind when you say it,
but he,

2975
01:59:45,461 --> 01:59:48,130
the guy had a point there.
The reporter had a really good point.

2976
01:59:48,280 --> 01:59:51,580
The point was,
if you want to point at all these media

2977
01:59:51,581 --> 01:59:54,490
outlets and say they're fake news and
they're giving bad information,

2978
01:59:54,940 --> 01:59:57,850
how can we listen to you when you're
giving bad information?

2979
01:59:58,540 --> 01:59:59,580
I mean,
that was a great point.

2980
01:59:59,600 --> 02:00:00,820
He shouldn't.
People when you.

2981
02:00:00,850 --> 02:00:02,800
When you say maybe because people don't
let you off the hook,

2982
02:00:03,130 --> 02:00:05,140
but if you say you're wrong about
something,

2983
02:00:05,170 --> 02:00:06,130
hey,
I made a mistake.

2984
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:10,450
People have a tendency to look at you
and like you for that because nobody,

2985
02:00:10,451 --> 02:00:12,340
nobody thinks she didn't.
Of course,

2986
02:00:12,550 --> 02:00:14,410
of course everybody knows you did own up
to it.

2987
02:00:14,770 --> 02:00:16,570
We're all human.
No one's perfect.

2988
02:00:16,750 --> 02:00:19,530
I'm always a person on bad.
That's all I'm saying that he should

2989
02:00:19,531 --> 02:00:20,910
know everybody's bad at it.
Well,

2990
02:00:21,010 --> 02:00:22,960
I shouldn't say everyone.
There's a great.

2991
02:00:22,961 --> 02:00:25,050
Many of us are very bad at that.
Yeah.

2992
02:00:25,090 --> 02:00:27,460
It's a very hard thing to admit,
especially if you feel like you're being

2993
02:00:27,461 --> 02:00:29,710
challenged.
It's very hard to admit that you're

2994
02:00:29,711 --> 02:00:30,441
wrong.
Yeah.

2995
02:00:30,441 --> 02:00:31,271
I like to just go,
hey man,

2996
02:00:31,271 --> 02:00:32,200
I made.
I made an error.

2997
02:00:32,860 --> 02:00:33,640
I shouldn't have done that.
Yeah,

2998
02:00:33,640 --> 02:00:35,980
but it's that feeling like I lost the
exchange.

2999
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:37,710
Yep.
Instead of winning a lot,

3000
02:00:37,720 --> 02:00:39,070
but then when you got to learn how to
lose.

3001
02:00:39,190 --> 02:00:40,570
Yeah,
that's one of the good things about

3002
02:00:40,571 --> 02:00:42,280
Jujitsu.
You learn how to lose.

3003
02:00:42,340 --> 02:00:43,173
You Do,
right?

3004
02:00:43,330 --> 02:00:44,770
You have to.
Everybody's put tapping.

3005
02:00:44,771 --> 02:00:46,870
You get tapped all the time.
Especially in the beginning.

3006
02:00:46,990 --> 02:00:48,490
Yeah.
I said I'm going to take to just do it.

3007
02:00:48,491 --> 02:00:50,670
I'm only going to take it until I get
tapped that unfinished.

3008
02:00:50,850 --> 02:00:51,880
Taking it for one day,
then.

3009
02:00:51,940 --> 02:00:52,820
Yeah,
no,

3010
02:00:52,840 --> 02:00:54,660
I really want to do it.
It really wasn't a true the entire.

3011
02:00:54,680 --> 02:00:55,670
Because when I went to,
you know,

3012
02:00:55,680 --> 02:00:57,220
it's like you walk into a place,
you get like a vibe,

3013
02:00:57,221 --> 02:01:01,060
and Matt walked me in and.
And do you think the mayor sure everyone

3014
02:01:01,061 --> 02:01:03,070
loves this guy and or even,
oh,

3015
02:01:03,071 --> 02:01:04,810
he's so great governance.
Jujitsu state,

3016
02:01:05,390 --> 02:01:07,180
and they love him.
Everybody does.

3017
02:01:07,240 --> 02:01:09,670
He's the most,
probably the most genuine guy.

3018
02:01:09,830 --> 02:01:11,520
There's no bullshit in this guy.
Yeah,

3019
02:01:11,560 --> 02:01:12,370
he's,
he,

3020
02:01:12,370 --> 02:01:16,330
I love Matt because he hates bullies.
Fucking hates bullies.

3021
02:01:16,540 --> 02:01:19,100
He's one of those guys who just doesn't
tolerate a guy who.

3022
02:01:19,260 --> 02:01:21,610
He's a short guy now.
Probably people fuck with him.

3023
02:01:21,611 --> 02:01:24,430
When he was younger,
he said that he just can't stand it.

3024
02:01:24,500 --> 02:01:27,250
That's probably a lot of guys.
That's what leads them to martial arts

3025
02:01:27,251 --> 02:01:29,020
in the first place.
George St Pierre the same thing.

3026
02:01:29,980 --> 02:01:33,100
Just not just tired of being bullied.
Tired of people fucking with them,

3027
02:01:33,250 --> 02:01:34,100
you know?
Well,

3028
02:01:34,101 --> 02:01:37,390
he walked me in a dangerous place and I
really liked the energy in there.

3029
02:01:37,391 --> 02:01:40,190
The people are so,
so it's something

3030
02:01:40,190 --> 02:01:42,830
I'm going to do places.
Sorry to interrupt you,

3031
02:01:42,831 --> 02:01:45,380
but if this one of the best places in
the world and in your neighborhood,

3032
02:01:45,410 --> 02:01:47,150
I know it's not far.
It's a few minutes.

3033
02:01:48,210 --> 02:01:51,680
One of the best in the world.
People travel from other countries to

3034
02:01:51,681 --> 02:01:53,900
come and train and Benzos.
They do 100 percent.

3035
02:01:54,110 --> 02:01:55,710
John Donner.
Oh yeah.

3036
02:01:56,410 --> 02:01:58,320
He is a fucking genius.
He's.

3037
02:01:58,480 --> 02:02:02,130
He is one of the most respected guys
introduced it today and what they call a

3038
02:02:02,131 --> 02:02:03,260
Donna,
her death squad,

3039
02:02:03,261 --> 02:02:06,140
like all those guys like Gary Tone and
all.

3040
02:02:06,210 --> 02:02:10,640
Eddie Cummins is so many really great
jujitsu players that he's.

3041
02:02:11,270 --> 02:02:15,770
He's training and mentoring in that one.
Jim,

3042
02:02:15,771 --> 02:02:17,950
like that one place.
Hence those places.

3043
02:02:17,960 --> 02:02:19,460
One of.
Absolutely.

3044
02:02:19,461 --> 02:02:22,140
One of the most respected places in the
world and I think today or yesterday,

3045
02:02:22,141 --> 02:02:23,720
it's his birthday.
So happy birthday.

3046
02:02:24,520 --> 02:02:28,100
Let them great because come on on filter
filtered a couple of times on the way

3047
02:02:28,101 --> 02:02:30,140
and that will bring them in as a cohort,
but I've never asked.

3048
02:02:30,680 --> 02:02:31,460
Oh,
that's awesome.

3049
02:02:31,460 --> 02:02:31,911
Yeah,
I want to,

3050
02:02:31,911 --> 02:02:33,100
I want to sit with him.
Um,

3051
02:02:33,470 --> 02:02:35,210
but I,
I really liked the energy and the people

3052
02:02:35,211 --> 02:02:36,920
were very nice and it was like you walk
into a place,

3053
02:02:36,921 --> 02:02:38,290
you're like,
I could see myself being here.

3054
02:02:38,300 --> 02:02:41,120
I couldn't,
but I didn't feel nervous or

3055
02:02:41,121 --> 02:02:43,100
uncomfortable on that.
This is a place I could come and learn

3056
02:02:43,101 --> 02:02:43,921
this.
I would love to.

3057
02:02:43,921 --> 02:02:45,200
Yes.
When you talk about it,

3058
02:02:45,380 --> 02:02:47,300
even like talk about it.
I'm not a fucking expert on it.

3059
02:02:47,360 --> 02:02:49,890
Like you want to know from experience
with certain things feel like.

3060
02:02:50,360 --> 02:02:52,180
And I,
it would make me more knowledgeable just

3061
02:02:52,181 --> 02:02:54,690
so you are always having people strangle
you just for the field.

3062
02:02:55,780 --> 02:02:57,740
But I respect it so much more after
that.

3063
02:02:57,741 --> 02:03:02,741
Like when you feel it came last.
Just puts a fucking a fucking a

3064
02:03:02,920 --> 02:03:03,681
guillotine.
Choke her.

3065
02:03:03,681 --> 02:03:05,310
Yeah.
For a second you're like,

3066
02:03:05,390 --> 02:03:10,040
Oh,
you guys do that with the intention of

3067
02:03:10,070 --> 02:03:12,230
hurting you and choking you out in a
real fight.

3068
02:03:12,530 --> 02:03:14,810
Staggers me.
Like when Jon Jones,

3069
02:03:15,140 --> 02:03:18,740
the worst one I took was fucking Joe.
That big Jon Jones,

3070
02:03:18,770 --> 02:03:21,470
Shannon my leg.
But I told you I felt like I had to shit

3071
02:03:21,770 --> 02:03:23,780
my body.
This video of it.

3072
02:03:23,781 --> 02:03:25,250
I was very fat.
When that happens,

3073
02:03:25,370 --> 02:03:28,690
that buck and I literally,
I was.

3074
02:03:29,240 --> 02:03:31,100
My Body just says,
here it is.

3075
02:03:31,101 --> 02:03:32,240
Let's get some volume.

3076
02:03:37,570 --> 02:03:42,570
Oh
Shit.

3077
02:03:55,070 --> 02:03:56,420
It's fucked up

3078
02:03:56,970 --> 02:03:58,500
that.
I mean he barely hit you.

3079
02:03:58,560 --> 02:04:00,170
He didn't put full strength with that
was.

3080
02:04:00,620 --> 02:04:02,940
That was like fight week sometime.
Don't get them on fight way to do it

3081
02:04:02,941 --> 02:04:05,160
because our order ramped up cutting
weight and not happy,

3082
02:04:05,190 --> 02:04:07,630
but he didn't even hit you hard.
He didn't even hit your heart on it.

3083
02:04:07,631 --> 02:04:09,180
It's going to choke you with a different
outfit.

3084
02:04:09,181 --> 02:04:11,460
This was a second horrible.
The way he's doing that.

3085
02:04:11,461 --> 02:04:12,540
That's a horrible joke.

3086
02:04:14,370 --> 02:04:15,203
Oh,
that's

3087
02:04:16,440 --> 02:04:20,550
horrible.
That's a horrible joke because he's

3088
02:04:20,551 --> 02:04:21,070
going,

3089
02:04:21,070 --> 02:04:24,700
that's an esophageal style.
Guillotine choke because he's.

3090
02:04:24,970 --> 02:04:29,200
He's using the bone of the forearm
across the front of your neck.

3091
02:04:29,201 --> 02:04:30,550
Yes.
He was the worst.

3092
02:04:30,690 --> 02:04:33,040
That's the most painful of the
guillotine.

3093
02:04:33,041 --> 02:04:33,940
Chokes.
Yeah.

3094
02:04:33,941 --> 02:04:34,980
He did it.
And uh,

3095
02:04:35,410 --> 02:04:36,211
the,
the kick,

3096
02:04:36,211 --> 02:04:38,760
they'll hurt me that the leg one your
body.

3097
02:04:38,761 --> 02:04:40,860
I felt like I had to.
I had to go to the bathroom.

3098
02:04:41,010 --> 02:04:42,060
Actually.
I thought I was gonna vomit.

3099
02:04:42,510 --> 02:04:45,690
I had to go to the bathroom and splash
water on myself like that.

3100
02:04:45,691 --> 02:04:47,150
I literally had to put one on my face.
I was like,

3101
02:04:47,151 --> 02:04:50,130
I might pass out.
It was because my body had not been.

3102
02:04:50,330 --> 02:04:53,310
It was like a shock to the system and I
hadn't felt that before.

3103
02:04:53,311 --> 02:04:58,311
Were your nerves to like slams into that
meat of your or your thigh and all those

3104
02:04:58,951 --> 02:05:02,190
nerves that run down the side of your
leg are all impacted and your whole

3105
02:05:02,191 --> 02:05:03,990
system just gets jacked dude.

3106
02:05:04,200 --> 02:05:08,340
But then you watch someone like Edson
Barboza kicking people like that lot and

3107
02:05:08,341 --> 02:05:09,330
I'm like,
this is a guy.

3108
02:05:09,380 --> 02:05:11,550
There's a guy standing there who knows
this is coming,

3109
02:05:12,150 --> 02:05:13,830
takes it.
And he continued.

3110
02:05:14,160 --> 02:05:16,740
Well that's a different thing because
you're so pumped up with adrenaline.

3111
02:05:16,741 --> 02:05:18,750
You're in the middle of the fight.
I mean those guys are in agony

3112
02:05:18,751 --> 02:05:20,580
afterwards though,
for sure they're walking out of there

3113
02:05:20,581 --> 02:05:21,690
and deep,
deep,

3114
02:05:21,691 --> 02:05:23,940
deep pain.
But to have felt any remote,

3115
02:05:23,941 --> 02:05:27,720
even if it's a 10 percent to a,
felt that at all and then know that

3116
02:05:27,750 --> 02:05:28,920
when,
when he's doing that,

3117
02:05:29,160 --> 02:05:32,430
because he wants to fucking put you out.
He's doing 100 percent.

3118
02:05:32,490 --> 02:05:34,320
You know what you should do.
You should do it for your show.

3119
02:05:34,470 --> 02:05:38,370
Were you like decide to like if you
filmed it,

3120
02:05:38,580 --> 02:05:43,580
if you filmed like your first day at Hen
Zos and like do it on a youtube channel

3121
02:05:44,580 --> 02:05:47,610
and a and go out there and do you have a
youtube channel?

3122
02:05:47,610 --> 02:05:49,770
You have your own youtube channel and I
don't do much with it.

3123
02:05:49,771 --> 02:05:52,620
I do more on the radio shows one now.
Just really put our episodes up.

3124
02:05:53,010 --> 02:05:56,220
But just do it though.
Have somewhat common film.

3125
02:05:56,221 --> 02:05:58,670
You taking your first class and have
someone you know,

3126
02:05:58,671 --> 02:06:00,960
put it together,
make a 10 minute little video out of it,

3127
02:06:01,200 --> 02:06:03,990
and you talking about what it's like.
Take your first Jujitsu class and then

3128
02:06:04,020 --> 02:06:05,790
commit to it and do it three times a
week.

3129
02:06:05,850 --> 02:06:07,150
Yeah,
I would like to do that because there's

3130
02:06:07,151 --> 02:06:08,760
a couple of days I could do it right
after the gym.

3131
02:06:09,600 --> 02:06:11,400
And don't do that.
You shouldn't.

3132
02:06:11,460 --> 02:06:12,510
No,
no.

3133
02:06:12,511 --> 02:06:15,090
You'll be too tired.
You're going to lift weights and then go

3134
02:06:15,390 --> 02:06:17,220
do Jujitsu.
You're going to get fucked up.

3135
02:06:17,280 --> 02:06:18,990
That's why I do the gym four days a
week,

3136
02:06:18,991 --> 02:06:20,550
so that's four days a week.
Yeah.

3137
02:06:20,551 --> 02:06:20,660
Yeah.

3138
02:06:20,660 --> 02:06:21,540
It's amazing.
Monday,

3139
02:06:21,541 --> 02:06:22,171
Tuesday,
Thursday,

3140
02:06:22,171 --> 02:06:23,400
Friday.
That's awesome.

3141
02:06:23,490 --> 02:06:24,690
That's really good,
man.

3142
02:06:24,750 --> 02:06:25,800
That's really good.
Yeah.

3143
02:06:25,801 --> 02:06:26,040
I'm,
I'm,

3144
02:06:26,040 --> 02:06:28,140
I'm dumb schedule.
I go like right after radio.

3145
02:06:28,230 --> 02:06:28,770
Oh,
okay.

3146
02:06:28,770 --> 02:06:31,650
And then.
Well if you did Jujitsu at night,

3147
02:06:31,651 --> 02:06:33,270
that'd be fine.
If you give yourself a few hours to

3148
02:06:33,271 --> 02:06:34,190
recover.
Yeah.

3149
02:06:34,191 --> 02:06:36,720
I totally stand up though because I
might schedule stinks.

3150
02:06:36,721 --> 02:06:39,700
I'm up at seven on the air at a to 11
fucking Jim,

3151
02:06:40,290 --> 02:06:42,490
you have a crazy schedule to two days a
week.

3152
02:06:42,510 --> 02:06:45,360
Did you decide to do morning radio again
because didn't you guys have the

3153
02:06:45,361 --> 02:06:48,240
opportunity to do it in the afternoon?
We wanted the mornings.

3154
02:06:48,241 --> 02:06:49,650
There's more people listening in the
morning,

3155
02:06:49,920 --> 02:06:54,920
but it's also because I became so used
to it that I wound up when I travel,

3156
02:06:55,620 --> 02:06:56,850
there's travel days,
man,

3157
02:06:56,851 --> 02:06:58,590
that I would miss out.
Like if I have to leave Thursday for

3158
02:06:58,591 --> 02:06:59,940
Friday Gig,
I don't want to miss Thursday and

3159
02:06:59,941 --> 02:07:00,240
Friday.

3160
02:07:00,240 --> 02:07:02,400
Shell and the guests are better in the
morning.

3161
02:07:03,300 --> 02:07:03,931
The better.
Yes.

3162
02:07:03,931 --> 02:07:05,410
There's more people in the building,
but I.

3163
02:07:05,600 --> 02:07:07,390
But I have afternoons is fun.
Seminar.

3164
02:07:07,391 --> 02:07:09,420
We pre pre-taped last night for this
morning show.

3165
02:07:09,421 --> 02:07:12,110
Just I was so fucking tired.
I knew I was coming here and I go,

3166
02:07:12,810 --> 02:07:14,970
I just wanted to do it.
It's hard to get good guests in the

3167
02:07:14,971 --> 02:07:16,080
afternoon.
Yes.

3168
02:07:16,160 --> 02:07:18,960
Because a lot of times the good guests
that you're going to get in New York,

3169
02:07:19,230 --> 02:07:20,350
they're doing fallon,
the dual,

3170
02:07:20,510 --> 02:07:22,890
uh,
found that doing a Kobe.

3171
02:07:23,130 --> 02:07:26,290
So by,
by three or 4:00 get amped up to go into

3172
02:07:26,300 --> 02:07:26,941
the studio.
Oh,

3173
02:07:26,941 --> 02:07:29,250
Cole bears in New York to studio.
Okay.

3174
02:07:29,370 --> 02:07:30,600
Yeah.
Thanks Seth.

3175
02:07:30,610 --> 02:07:34,560
Meyers Meyers and they will get good
guests but it's just we get,

3176
02:07:34,710 --> 02:07:38,560
I'd say 70 percent more people are
coming through in the morning plus

3177
02:07:38,561 --> 02:07:41,170
Howard's in the morning,
so like sometimes people come in and do

3178
02:07:41,171 --> 02:07:46,171
him or they'll do this or that and he's
got to show know it's a plus.

3179
02:07:46,840 --> 02:07:48,880
I just,
it makes me feel like I can go to the

3180
02:07:48,881 --> 02:07:52,660
gym if you let me sleep all day.
I'll wind up getting up at fucking 1:30.

3181
02:07:52,960 --> 02:07:56,440
I'll be on the air by [inaudible] till
seven and then I'll go fucking do spots

3182
02:07:56,441 --> 02:07:59,630
and then I'm up all night on the
computer like I'm up to no good that

3183
02:07:59,780 --> 02:08:01,450
time.
You know what I mean?

3184
02:08:01,480 --> 02:08:04,120
Because you can't go and take Jujitsu at
1:30 in the morning.

3185
02:08:04,450 --> 02:08:06,520
If that was an option.
I do.

3186
02:08:06,521 --> 02:08:09,610
Afternoons,
it seems like there would be a place

3187
02:08:09,611 --> 02:08:13,690
where you could do Jujitsu in the 1:00
in the afternoon or 1:00 in the morning.

3188
02:08:13,820 --> 02:08:16,060
Once I'm up,
I just got to go like Monday.

3189
02:08:16,061 --> 02:08:17,110
Monday is my busiest.
It's,

3190
02:08:17,111 --> 02:08:18,460
it's,
it's fucking radio.

3191
02:08:18,461 --> 02:08:22,570
Jim unfiltered.
And I'm home by like three or 3:30 in

3192
02:08:22,571 --> 02:08:24,130
the afternoon,
so I feel like I get a lot done.

3193
02:08:24,180 --> 02:08:27,250
And do you go out that night and do
standup on Monday?

3194
02:08:27,250 --> 02:08:30,190
I'll do two sets because there's a
regular set at the cellar and around the

3195
02:08:30,191 --> 02:08:31,300
corner.
They have new joke night.

3196
02:08:31,660 --> 02:08:33,370
A will.
So then it's runs new joke.

3197
02:08:33,430 --> 02:08:35,170
Dayas a great show.
Oh Nice.

3198
02:08:35,171 --> 02:08:36,580
So how many nights a week are you doing?
Stand up?

3199
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:38,700
Six or seven?
Not whoa.

3200
02:08:38,740 --> 02:08:39,700
Yeah,
almost every night.

3201
02:08:39,900 --> 02:08:43,090
Um,
I'm working on because the special comes

3202
02:08:43,091 --> 02:08:43,930
out today.
Oh,

3203
02:08:43,931 --> 02:08:44,860
that's right.
That's right.

3204
02:08:44,920 --> 02:08:45,850
And uh,
I'm,

3205
02:08:46,060 --> 02:08:47,770
I started,
I shot in December,

3206
02:08:48,010 --> 02:08:51,730
so I've been since December working on
material just to get it sooner.

3207
02:08:51,750 --> 02:08:53,140
Like loud.
I got a new 35,

3208
02:08:53,170 --> 02:08:54,280
you know.
Right,

3209
02:08:54,310 --> 02:08:54,930
right,
right.

3210
02:08:54,930 --> 02:08:56,800
I just drop it as soon as I'm done,
I shoot.

3211
02:08:58,040 --> 02:09:00,100
Just think of it right by that point
you're like enough.

3212
02:09:00,580 --> 02:09:05,550
Jerry Seinfeld did the Improv the other
night and did 20 year old jokes did he

3213
02:09:05,620 --> 02:09:07,900
did a set,
did a couple of new bits and then he did

3214
02:09:07,901 --> 02:09:11,020
jokes from like 20 years ago.
Really in a couple of my friends were in

3215
02:09:11,021 --> 02:09:14,710
the audience know like what is he doing?
Like why is he doing these jokes that

3216
02:09:14,711 --> 02:09:18,310
everybody knows and I guess in his eyes
they're like classic songs.

3217
02:09:18,420 --> 02:09:20,020
Yeah.
Now it's like you go to see the Beatles,

3218
02:09:20,021 --> 02:09:21,070
you want to hear,
I don't know what to say.

3219
02:09:21,080 --> 02:09:23,450
The Beatles,
they're all picking on another,

3220
02:09:23,510 --> 02:09:25,710
a better lender.
Scattered a guns and roses.

3221
02:09:27,820 --> 02:09:30,280
If you go to see a,
you know,

3222
02:09:30,281 --> 02:09:31,420
whatever,
whoever the fuck it is,

3223
02:09:31,421 --> 02:09:32,790
you expect to hear the classics.
I.

3224
02:09:32,791 --> 02:09:34,660
Yes.
Maybe it's different when you're a guy

3225
02:09:34,661 --> 02:09:36,890
from a different era.
He's from a different era than we are

3226
02:09:37,050 --> 02:09:38,920
hopeless songs.
Don't have to catch you off guard jokes

3227
02:09:38,921 --> 02:09:40,360
too.
That's why jokes don't work forever

3228
02:09:40,990 --> 02:09:43,210
because the song you're here and you
become familiar with and you learn the

3229
02:09:43,211 --> 02:09:44,030
lyrics,
you know,

3230
02:09:44,030 --> 02:09:45,610
and you like it.
You like it more.

3231
02:09:45,640 --> 02:09:47,110
You want to hear,
I mean songs.

3232
02:09:47,111 --> 02:09:49,450
Repeat them.
Doug Stanhope was a great bit about

3233
02:09:49,451 --> 02:09:52,090
that.
Here's a great bit about songs being

3234
02:09:52,150 --> 02:09:54,920
fucking lazy.
It's really funny to hear it.

3235
02:09:55,630 --> 02:09:58,420
He says like the same punchline over and
over and over again,

3236
02:09:58,421 --> 02:10:01,270
and then he just,
I don't want to give away the actual way

3237
02:10:01,271 --> 02:10:02,500
sets up the bit,
but it's funny.

3238
02:10:02,530 --> 02:10:04,420
That's very funny.
But it's true.

3239
02:10:04,660 --> 02:10:05,770
Yeah.
But some,

3240
02:10:05,830 --> 02:10:08,110
some guys,
they don't want to let go of that shit.

3241
02:10:08,290 --> 02:10:09,850
They don't want to let go of that old
stuff.

3242
02:10:09,960 --> 02:10:10,793
No,
they,

3243
02:10:11,080 --> 02:10:13,360
they feel like,
well jerry was always said that and I

3244
02:10:13,361 --> 02:10:14,750
don't know him,
but I,

3245
02:10:14,751 --> 02:10:15,940
I mean,
I don't know why I know him,

3246
02:10:15,941 --> 02:10:18,250
but um,
he said like that he thinks that the

3247
02:10:18,490 --> 02:10:20,680
people come for the act and not the
performer.

3248
02:10:20,980 --> 02:10:23,050
And maybe at one point they did,
they want to see your act.

3249
02:10:23,051 --> 02:10:26,260
I think lentil feels that way too.
They come to see the jokes in a way

3250
02:10:26,261 --> 02:10:28,210
that's true.
But I also think that once they know

3251
02:10:28,211 --> 02:10:30,370
your jokes,
they want new jokes from the personality

3252
02:10:30,371 --> 02:10:31,240
they like.
Yeah.

3253
02:10:31,270 --> 02:10:33,860
Like,
like Seinfeld did that I'm telling you

3254
02:10:33,861 --> 02:10:37,280
for the last time we did a whole hour
special of old jokes.

3255
02:10:37,300 --> 02:10:38,270
Yeah.
That he was done with.

3256
02:10:38,450 --> 02:10:39,520
Yeah.
But that was like,

3257
02:10:39,620 --> 02:10:40,450
those are,
there are,

3258
02:10:40,450 --> 02:10:42,830
there were again,
they were 20 year old bits and I don't

3259
02:10:42,831 --> 02:10:44,330
think that special was well received.

3260
02:10:44,390 --> 02:10:45,020
I asked,
you know,

3261
02:10:45,020 --> 02:10:46,750
I don't think I saw it but don't
understand.

3262
02:10:46,790 --> 02:10:48,740
I understand why you'd want to do that
if you'll make some money,

3263
02:10:49,310 --> 02:10:52,430
but it doesn't feel good to do it.
And he has what I seem to new shit.

3264
02:10:52,431 --> 02:10:55,680
It's like he's new stuff kills.
It was doing when he goes out and just

3265
02:10:55,840 --> 02:10:59,690
start to work on things like he sees a
fucking really good comment.

3266
02:10:59,691 --> 02:11:01,550
He's a great comic.
There's no doubt about it.

3267
02:11:01,580 --> 02:11:05,120
But I think his idea is different than
the idea of the current guys and maybe

3268
02:11:05,121 --> 02:11:09,260
in a bit he's resisting this new trend
is the trend that everybody does.

3269
02:11:09,261 --> 02:11:11,270
Well it's burr or ck.
Are you?

3270
02:11:11,630 --> 02:11:14,750
Everybody releases a special and then
abandoned the material.

3271
02:11:14,780 --> 02:11:16,040
I do.
It already does it?

3272
02:11:16,370 --> 02:11:19,730
Everybody I know does it and there's.
Then there's a few guys that just don't

3273
02:11:19,731 --> 02:11:21,650
really specials.
They just don't.

3274
02:11:21,710 --> 02:11:25,720
And they have like really old material.
Like I know a few guys that are like

3275
02:11:25,730 --> 02:11:29,450
really good comics,
but they just don't put out specials

3276
02:11:29,810 --> 02:11:32,450
because they want to keep doing the act.
They just don't want to be.

3277
02:11:33,120 --> 02:11:36,560
They don't want to be committed also to
to recording like that.

3278
02:11:36,561 --> 02:11:39,470
There's a lot of pressure to bat and
everything down and tightened it up and

3279
02:11:39,471 --> 02:11:41,750
then get ready to release it.
Ready,

3280
02:11:41,751 --> 02:11:42,710
press,
play,

3281
02:11:42,830 --> 02:11:46,010
record go.
You know this a,

3282
02:11:46,220 --> 02:11:48,700
a lot of pressure in that.
I love doing it until I'm like,

3283
02:11:48,710 --> 02:11:49,910
amy did it weird.
She did.

3284
02:11:49,970 --> 02:11:54,080
She did her special and then she toured
until the special aired so now she has

3285
02:11:54,081 --> 02:11:56,270
to start over.
But for me I will as soon as it was shot

3286
02:11:56,271 --> 02:11:58,940
I wanted it done.
So by the time it airs or some like I

3287
02:11:58,941 --> 02:11:59,370
got.
Fuck.

3288
02:11:59,370 --> 02:12:02,530
I couldn't wait to not say those things
and couldn't fucking wave.

3289
02:12:02,920 --> 02:12:04,280
Yeah.
That shit man.

3290
02:12:04,340 --> 02:12:05,690
I just.
One of the finished.

3291
02:12:05,780 --> 02:12:07,790
Yeah,
everybody's got their own way of doing

3292
02:12:07,791 --> 02:12:08,390
it,
you know.

3293
02:12:08,390 --> 02:12:11,000
But I think the point is that in this
day and age,

3294
02:12:11,030 --> 02:12:13,940
the public demands content.
Sure,

3295
02:12:14,300 --> 02:12:16,670
you'll have to put it out and you're
putting out a lot of content anyway

3296
02:12:16,671 --> 02:12:18,740
because you have your radio show,
you have your podcast,

3297
02:12:19,110 --> 02:12:20,390
you know,
I remember you used to write a lot of

3298
02:12:20,391 --> 02:12:23,840
blogs and you used to,
you're used to be pretty prolific with

3299
02:12:23,841 --> 02:12:26,000
blogs.
That was because we were off the radio

3300
02:12:26,420 --> 02:12:29,690
and I was blogging a,
all these sex that actually became happy

3301
02:12:29,691 --> 02:12:30,590
endings.
The first book,

3302
02:12:31,120 --> 02:12:34,400
it was all these blogs I wrote about
things I was doing and I had nowhere I

3303
02:12:34,401 --> 02:12:36,560
started writing again,
reach that really want to do another

3304
02:12:36,561 --> 02:12:39,680
book on my head,
a sexual experience with this girl.

3305
02:12:39,890 --> 02:12:42,140
And uh,
I just had to write after it because it

3306
02:12:42,141 --> 02:12:44,180
was,
it was really weird and intimate and

3307
02:12:44,181 --> 02:12:45,014
sexy.

3308
02:12:45,200 --> 02:12:47,990
And yet what happened?
I just felt connected.

3309
02:12:48,470 --> 02:12:50,240
I felt really connected,
no drugs.

3310
02:12:50,300 --> 02:12:51,133
And then she,
uh,

3311
02:12:51,140 --> 02:12:53,690
no drugs.
And then she texted me from the elevator

3312
02:12:54,170 --> 02:12:55,360
and said,
which one is the,

3313
02:12:55,361 --> 02:12:56,870
uh,
which one is the lobby?

3314
02:12:57,770 --> 02:13:02,770
And I realized what a dope.
I just had the l one that says,

3315
02:13:03,531 --> 02:13:04,060
Al,
I,

3316
02:13:04,060 --> 02:13:05,480
I,
I am not kidding you.

3317
02:13:05,481 --> 02:13:08,770
That she asked which one was the lobby
and she wasn't Jonathan Mistake,

3318
02:13:09,340 --> 02:13:11,940
um,
and I had to write,

3319
02:13:12,100 --> 02:13:13,130
I had to write it.
I'm like,

3320
02:13:13,131 --> 02:13:15,290
it was so because it was,
I'm not good at going back and grabbing

3321
02:13:15,291 --> 02:13:16,124
shit.
I'm,

3322
02:13:16,180 --> 02:13:18,290
and maybe that's the radio training
where you're just alive.

3323
02:13:18,291 --> 02:13:19,124
We,
we're talking,

3324
02:13:19,300 --> 02:13:21,920
but I had to do it in the moment.
Just write it like I'm good at writing

3325
02:13:21,921 --> 02:13:23,690
then,
but I'm not good at going back and go,

3326
02:13:23,691 --> 02:13:25,400
wow.
Two years ago when this happened and

3327
02:13:25,670 --> 02:13:26,780
people aspect,
there'll be nothing to show.

3328
02:13:26,780 --> 02:13:27,990
I'm like,
I'm not good at going back and writing

3329
02:13:28,020 --> 02:13:29,960
all that shit because the emotion for it
is past.

3330
02:13:29,990 --> 02:13:34,140
Do you ever try those transcription
software programs where you talk and it

3331
02:13:34,141 --> 02:13:36,880
just records what you're saying?
I have another follow up series,

3332
02:13:37,320 --> 02:13:40,500
but I do use that a lot when I used to
write for time once in awhile and I

3333
02:13:40,501 --> 02:13:43,290
would just talk out the whole fucking
article because I'm not good at starting

3334
02:13:43,460 --> 02:13:46,980
up a lot about and all of a sudden I'm
good at organizing and editing,

3335
02:13:47,370 --> 02:13:50,050
but I yapped it out already.
I will be running for Time magazine and

3336
02:13:50,160 --> 02:13:51,490
David asked me,
they would,

3337
02:13:51,510 --> 02:13:54,150
they would ask me to write about the
first article I wrote.

3338
02:13:54,151 --> 02:13:56,010
I wish I didn't write actually about
prostitution.

3339
02:13:58,500 --> 02:14:00,700
Why do you wish you didn't write it?
Because I.

3340
02:14:00,700 --> 02:14:04,230
There's certain things I said it just,
I wished I had said it smarter.

3341
02:14:04,530 --> 02:14:07,320
I wish I had been clearer.
I was talking about how John shouldn't

3342
02:14:07,321 --> 02:14:09,030
be embarrassed and in a way I agree with
that,

3343
02:14:09,240 --> 02:14:12,690
but there was certain things that people
in the sex industry who had been victims

3344
02:14:12,691 --> 02:14:15,900
of trafficking and stuff like I should
probably address that better.

3345
02:14:16,340 --> 02:14:18,120
Um,
there is a big difference between

3346
02:14:18,121 --> 02:14:23,121
trafficking and a woman who just decides
to have sex with guys for money.

3347
02:14:23,670 --> 02:14:26,070
And there are a lot of those women and
feminists don't want to admit those

3348
02:14:26,071 --> 02:14:28,740
women exist because they still,
for them,

3349
02:14:28,741 --> 02:14:32,520
they'll push up the trafficking numbers
because it's a stronger argument against

3350
02:14:32,521 --> 02:14:34,410
prostitution.
It's like I get it.

3351
02:14:34,411 --> 02:14:37,200
The traffickers should be executed and
saved the people who are being

3352
02:14:37,201 --> 02:14:39,840
trafficked.
But if someone makes a decision and they

3353
02:14:39,841 --> 02:14:42,150
just want to do it,
well there's one friend of mine who's an

3354
02:14:42,151 --> 02:14:45,360
artist and she's a feminist and she's
actually pretty successful and she's

3355
02:14:45,361 --> 02:14:48,390
actually talked pretty openly about when
she was younger,

3356
02:14:48,391 --> 02:14:53,391
she would do stuff like that where she
would fuck older rich guys for money.

3357
02:14:53,970 --> 02:14:55,470
And she's like,
there's nothing wrong with it.

3358
02:14:55,500 --> 02:14:58,560
Like I chose to do it.
I did it because it was a great way for

3359
02:14:58,561 --> 02:15:00,330
me to pay my bills.
It's easy.

3360
02:15:00,360 --> 02:15:01,980
These are guides I chose to have sex
with.

3361
02:15:02,010 --> 02:15:03,960
They were nice guys.
I'd fuck them.

3362
02:15:04,050 --> 02:15:05,880
I'd take the money and she'd make,
you know,

3363
02:15:05,881 --> 02:15:08,310
I don't know,
whatever the pay a thousand bucks,

3364
02:15:08,311 --> 02:15:11,190
whatever the fuck it is.
And she could get that in a couple of

3365
02:15:11,191 --> 02:15:13,890
hours.
We're rather than working for an entire

3366
02:15:13,891 --> 02:15:18,891
week for probably more than we are.
And it's the same group of people that

3367
02:15:19,051 --> 02:15:22,650
are saying you shouldn't be ashamed of
sex and keep your laws off my body are

3368
02:15:22,651 --> 02:15:24,510
the same ones as saying,
if you're getting paid for what,

3369
02:15:24,511 --> 02:15:26,130
you should be ashamed of it and I should
be able to lead.

3370
02:15:26,220 --> 02:15:27,450
It's so silly.
It's silly.

3371
02:15:27,451 --> 02:15:31,170
It's all silly because first of all,
it should you be ashamed if you massage

3372
02:15:31,171 --> 02:15:33,030
people,
if you give him a back rub.

3373
02:15:33,530 --> 02:15:34,770
Is that.
Is that a shameful?

3374
02:15:34,771 --> 02:15:36,420
No,
that's a very respected thing.

3375
02:15:36,421 --> 02:15:38,040
If someone tells you their massage
therapist,

3376
02:15:38,340 --> 02:15:39,570
oh,
you're making people feel good,

3377
02:15:39,810 --> 02:15:41,940
what do you do?
I just rub dicks and really good at

3378
02:15:41,941 --> 02:15:44,170
Robin Dicks and guys like it.
Oh well they.

3379
02:15:44,230 --> 02:15:46,890
They probably feel real good,
but now when it comes to pleasure,

3380
02:15:47,100 --> 02:15:50,160
we don't allow pleasure in the genital
area that were like,

3381
02:15:50,180 --> 02:15:52,390
whoa,
that's the dirty naughty prep.

3382
02:15:52,720 --> 02:15:55,620
Why I don't go to like is Asian massage
places don't do that.

3383
02:15:55,740 --> 02:15:58,230
No,
we're rushing because they feel like

3384
02:15:58,290 --> 02:16:01,740
those to me are more sex slaves.
That's what I don't like.

3385
02:16:01,741 --> 02:16:02,461
The energy there.
I,

3386
02:16:02,461 --> 02:16:06,420
I've very rarely gone and I've got maybe
two in my life in those places and I

3387
02:16:06,421 --> 02:16:11,160
don't go ever go to massage places
because I live an ethical pervert.

3388
02:16:11,780 --> 02:16:14,790
I feel like I like to,
and I know that there are certain women

3389
02:16:14,791 --> 02:16:17,100
that do it because I've had a couple of
women I dated,

3390
02:16:17,310 --> 02:16:21,600
legitimately dated
that wound up doing stuff like that for

3391
02:16:21,601 --> 02:16:24,070
money after that they told me about
like,

3392
02:16:24,320 --> 02:16:26,790
like really and had never done my
dynamic with them,

3393
02:16:26,791 --> 02:16:29,250
so I know for 100 percent fact they
weren't being pimped at forest.

3394
02:16:29,250 --> 02:16:33,400
I know they weren't,
but I don't like a massage place where I

3395
02:16:33,401 --> 02:16:36,370
think somebody has to do it.
Like it doesn't again,

3396
02:16:36,371 --> 02:16:38,680
that's just sad to me.
Like we're rushing place where I think

3397
02:16:38,681 --> 02:16:40,340
that they're being brought over for
these reasons,

3398
02:16:40,650 --> 02:16:45,650
like talking to a girl and I get
contacted with social media all the time

3399
02:16:46,360 --> 02:16:46,960
and if,
if I,

3400
02:16:46,960 --> 02:16:49,150
if I've talked to her,
I found out she's rushing and I'm not to

3401
02:16:49,151 --> 02:16:50,350
be raised in Russia.
Ngos are hot,

3402
02:16:51,130 --> 02:16:53,770
but I start to doubt what the,
uh,

3403
02:16:53,940 --> 02:16:57,700
like I talked to one girl off a website
and I wasn't game right away.

3404
02:16:58,030 --> 02:16:59,230
And uh,
she got a little weird.

3405
02:16:59,240 --> 02:17:00,670
I'm like,
are you being forced to do this?

3406
02:17:00,910 --> 02:17:01,601
And she was like,
oh no,

3407
02:17:01,601 --> 02:17:02,411
no.
I'll talk to you later.

3408
02:17:02,411 --> 02:17:03,730
We just never spoke again,
but like it was just

3409
02:17:03,930 --> 02:17:05,430
um,
it

3410
02:17:05,430 --> 02:17:07,710
wasn't something she was setting you up.
I don't know.

3411
02:17:07,711 --> 02:17:10,410
It's just not a sexy energy.
This is not even sent me up,

3412
02:17:10,411 --> 02:17:12,660
but maybe it's just somebody was doing
it so she had to pay back something.

3413
02:17:12,661 --> 02:17:14,640
I don't know,
but that's not a sexual energy.

3414
02:17:14,641 --> 02:17:15,980
It's a sad energy.
Yeah.

3415
02:17:16,090 --> 02:17:17,670
That's interesting.
That's interesting.

3416
02:17:17,671 --> 02:17:20,000
So you definitely clearly differentiate.
Yeah.

3417
02:17:20,001 --> 02:17:22,200
You're unethical pervert.
Nothing wrong with that.

3418
02:17:22,260 --> 02:17:23,190
Yeah.
I mean,

3419
02:17:23,570 --> 02:17:24,460
you're a good guy.
Yeah.

3420
02:17:24,480 --> 02:17:26,240
I just,
I don't like the idea of I,

3421
02:17:26,300 --> 02:17:27,880
but I think everybody should look at it
that way.

3422
02:17:27,881 --> 02:17:29,940
It's almost like.
But people get married just for money.

3423
02:17:30,180 --> 02:17:31,920
Like how many married?
It's like,

3424
02:17:32,220 --> 02:17:34,230
what?
Are you just a hooker with one client?

3425
02:17:34,290 --> 02:17:35,040
I mean,
is that what you are?

3426
02:17:35,040 --> 02:17:36,060
Fuck yeah,
dude.

3427
02:17:36,061 --> 02:17:38,670
I met this woman the other day.
She was like 40 years old.

3428
02:17:38,671 --> 02:17:42,960
Hot as fuck.
Her husband looks like he's about 70.

3429
02:17:43,230 --> 02:17:45,350
He's got terrible.
Posture is leaning over.

3430
02:17:45,360 --> 02:17:48,540
He stopped,
stepped out of a fucking bad ass Bentley

3431
02:17:48,541 --> 02:17:50,940
or whatever the fuck it was.
Some beautiful car.

3432
02:17:50,941 --> 02:17:51,691
And you're like,
oh,

3433
02:17:51,691 --> 02:17:52,740
okay,
I see what's going on there.

3434
02:17:52,741 --> 02:17:54,150
Yeah,
no worries.

3435
02:17:54,180 --> 02:17:55,980
I mean maybe you have the best
personality ever,

3436
02:17:56,130 --> 02:17:58,410
but the dude looked like it was just
falling asleep while he's walking.

3437
02:17:58,530 --> 02:17:59,880
Yeah.
You know what that's about.

3438
02:17:59,881 --> 02:18:04,590
It's a real rich older guy who got some
hot piece of ass who is younger than him

3439
02:18:04,591 --> 02:18:07,800
by like at least 30 years and they're
both getting what they want.

3440
02:18:08,250 --> 02:18:11,220
She wants a guy who maybe talk to her
nicely and it isn't some young guy

3441
02:18:11,221 --> 02:18:14,310
that's fucking acting like an asshole
who can take care of her.

3442
02:18:14,760 --> 02:18:16,310
He wants to young,
beautiful like it.

3443
02:18:16,350 --> 02:18:17,970
As long as you both honest and
respectful,

3444
02:18:17,971 --> 02:18:20,090
who cares?
It is a form of prostitution.

3445
02:18:20,090 --> 02:18:20,911
Shirt is.
It is.

3446
02:18:20,911 --> 02:18:23,120
Absolutely.
A lot of marriages are form of

3447
02:18:23,121 --> 02:18:25,560
prostitution.
People just don't want to admit it

3448
02:18:25,590 --> 02:18:27,270
because they think the prostitution is
bad.

3449
02:18:27,480 --> 02:18:30,510
Sex for money is bad.
But like there's a lot of people that

3450
02:18:30,511 --> 02:18:34,110
are engaged in some sexual relations
with people that are only doing it for

3451
02:18:34,111 --> 02:18:35,800
money.
How many women try to me,

3452
02:18:36,030 --> 02:18:37,950
let me try to trap basketball players.
Oh yeah.

3453
02:18:38,290 --> 02:18:40,380
So your prostate,
if you try to trap a ballplayer and get

3454
02:18:40,381 --> 02:18:41,700
pregnant,
you want the money.

3455
02:18:41,730 --> 02:18:43,030
That's prostitution.
Well,

3456
02:18:43,060 --> 02:18:44,700
it's a payday.
They want a kid.

3457
02:18:45,300 --> 02:18:46,660
They want some Dick.
Huh?

3458
02:18:46,700 --> 02:18:48,570
I want some cash.
It's a package deal.

3459
02:18:48,720 --> 02:18:49,900
Beautiful package deal.
Look,

3460
02:18:49,920 --> 02:18:52,530
you can't get a better package to get
knocked up by an NBA guy.

3461
02:18:52,531 --> 02:18:55,080
I mean Jesus Christ who wouldn't take a
load for Lebron,

3462
02:18:55,640 --> 02:18:57,330
going to ask him to put a bag on you.
Crazy.

3463
02:18:57,331 --> 02:18:59,940
If you do a lot of money,
you know,

3464
02:19:00,380 --> 02:19:02,700
and,
and there's nothing you can sign where

3465
02:19:02,701 --> 02:19:04,200
if you have a kid,
he won't get money.

3466
02:19:04,740 --> 02:19:06,630
Can't sign away that kids write to his
money.

3467
02:19:06,780 --> 02:19:08,730
As soon as they came out with genetic
testing,

3468
02:19:09,090 --> 02:19:11,210
boy that changed the game.
I said,

3469
02:19:11,630 --> 02:19:15,450
no one's denying change the game.
You gotta tell me fucking ty cobb didn't

3470
02:19:15,451 --> 02:19:19,050
lie about a few of them.
I'm sure you know a ted Williams doesn't

3471
02:19:19,051 --> 02:19:22,350
even look like me.
Good point to those guys.

3472
02:19:22,351 --> 02:19:24,780
Probably dump loads and the gals all
over the country.

3473
02:19:24,900 --> 02:19:25,361
Then.
No Way.

3474
02:19:25,361 --> 02:19:26,670
What are you going?
How are you going to find out?

3475
02:19:26,910 --> 02:19:29,480
How would you find out who she going to
tell you?

3476
02:19:30,130 --> 02:19:31,940
Dude,
I fuck ty cobb and for somebody.

3477
02:19:32,780 --> 02:19:34,100
It's a different game,
man.

3478
02:19:34,130 --> 02:19:35,570
Babe Ruth.
A lot of fat face,

3479
02:19:35,571 --> 02:19:37,720
a little babies running around there
probably are a

3480
02:19:39,440 --> 02:19:43,780
little babe ruth legs moving.
It's so funny when you look back at Babe

3481
02:19:43,780 --> 02:19:46,400
Ruth at bobby that he had so ridiculous
as fat,

3482
02:19:46,401 --> 02:19:47,181
Gut,
fat,

3483
02:19:47,181 --> 02:19:48,560
gut and eating hot dogs.

3484
02:19:48,640 --> 02:19:50,120
Drinking beer.
Good picture though.

3485
02:19:50,170 --> 02:19:51,280
You know,
he had a deauville,

3486
02:19:51,360 --> 02:19:55,430
multifaceted player and I love the quote
and Cobb and it ran pretty well for fat

3487
02:19:55,431 --> 02:19:57,030
man.
That was the only thing you can say

3488
02:19:57,050 --> 02:19:59,780
about Babe Ruth.
Ty cobb is one of the most underrated

3489
02:19:59,781 --> 02:20:02,720
films ever by the way,
with fucking Robert Wool and uh,

3490
02:20:02,721 --> 02:20:05,590
and Tommy Lee Jones is ty cobb.
Oh,

3491
02:20:05,650 --> 02:20:08,420
that's good movie.
Probably secretly fairly accurate.

3492
02:20:08,720 --> 02:20:09,950
Yeah.
You know,

3493
02:20:10,030 --> 02:20:12,020
you think about it,
a lot of athletes are,

3494
02:20:12,310 --> 02:20:16,070
and especially back then was really very
few repercussions for being a piece

3495
02:20:16,071 --> 02:20:17,130
shit.
Yeah.

3496
02:20:17,200 --> 02:20:19,550
It really wouldn't get out.
And I won't say the quote,

3497
02:20:19,910 --> 02:20:23,690
but it's got arguably the best quote in
movie history,

3498
02:20:23,691 --> 02:20:25,970
which I'll tell you after you tell me
now.

3499
02:20:26,060 --> 02:20:28,940
It's just really vicious,
racist and I just don't want to deal

3500
02:20:28,941 --> 02:20:30,020
with anything.
I know the one.

3501
02:20:30,260 --> 02:20:33,170
Yeah,
I know you're talking about my favorite

3502
02:20:33,171 --> 02:20:34,004
quote ever.

3503
02:20:34,460 --> 02:20:36,130
There's no way to squeeze it into
conversation,

3504
02:20:36,240 --> 02:20:40,670
but it's a funny a budget.
It's just a funny fucking thing.

3505
02:20:40,700 --> 02:20:43,670
It's a funny thing too,
when you think about athletes and how

3506
02:20:43,671 --> 02:20:46,460
competitive they have to be in how
ruthless you have to be,

3507
02:20:46,880 --> 02:20:48,980
you know?
And then that sort of bleeds out into

3508
02:20:48,981 --> 02:20:50,360
the rest of their life,
you know,

3509
02:20:50,361 --> 02:20:53,630
and it bleeds out into the way they deal
with a fellow players,

3510
02:20:53,631 --> 02:20:56,810
the way they deal with women that deal
with managers or anybody.

3511
02:20:57,600 --> 02:21:01,580
I mean there's athletic athletics is a
ruthless,

3512
02:21:01,581 --> 02:21:03,410
ruthless pursuit.
It is.

3513
02:21:03,440 --> 02:21:04,340
I mean,
it just is.

3514
02:21:04,460 --> 02:21:05,910
Have you tasted on?
No.

3515
02:21:06,080 --> 02:21:07,160
Oh yeah,
he'd be great.

3516
02:21:07,190 --> 02:21:08,660
I would love to.
You had him on your show,

3517
02:21:08,661 --> 02:21:09,141
right?
Launch.

3518
02:21:09,141 --> 02:21:10,520
Yeah.
And I'm sure he would do this if he was

3519
02:21:10,521 --> 02:21:11,420
here.
He would love you.

3520
02:21:11,421 --> 02:21:12,201
I'm sure he does.
Love you.

3521
02:21:12,201 --> 02:21:12,860
He loves you.
Have.

3522
02:21:12,860 --> 02:21:14,890
Say when I first met with,
Yay.

3523
02:21:18,030 --> 02:21:18,820
Yeah,
he's,

3524
02:21:18,820 --> 02:21:22,650
he's awesome,
but he's a great athlete and just,

3525
02:21:23,600 --> 02:21:26,330
he's like kind of the personification.
Everything you can go right and

3526
02:21:26,331 --> 02:21:29,150
everything that can go wrong and sort of
balance out at the end.

3527
02:21:29,151 --> 02:21:32,680
I mean he sort of achieve homeostasis at
the end of his life or it's at the end

3528
02:21:32,920 --> 02:21:36,500
like balance.
I mean he's at 50 years old,

3529
02:21:36,501 --> 02:21:40,580
he's got family,
he's got this great new career where

3530
02:21:40,581 --> 02:21:43,940
he's does that one man show and it's
hugely successful.

3531
02:21:44,120 --> 02:21:47,090
He loves it.
He was a recent article in sports

3532
02:21:47,091 --> 02:21:49,760
illustrated.
We was talking about doing that one man

3533
02:21:49,761 --> 02:21:52,490
show and how excited he gets to do and
how fun it is.

3534
02:21:52,491 --> 02:21:55,100
And he's amazing at it too,
you know?

3535
02:21:55,101 --> 02:21:57,980
And then that documentary sort of
revived him and then the one man show

3536
02:21:57,981 --> 02:22:01,670
came behind that.
So he's like in this new stage in his

3537
02:22:02,300 --> 02:22:05,570
life where he's achieved this strange
new balance,

3538
02:22:05,571 --> 02:22:06,760
you know,
like foremen,

3539
02:22:06,790 --> 02:22:09,080
they always say foreman in when we were
kings,

3540
02:22:09,520 --> 02:22:12,090
it might have been a norman mailer who
said he was this.

3541
02:22:12,580 --> 02:22:14,910
He was,
he was not a likable guy and he's.

3542
02:22:14,930 --> 02:22:18,530
Then he gets knocked out,
he comes back and he's a lovable grill

3543
02:22:18,531 --> 02:22:19,910
salesman.
Funny Dude,

3544
02:22:20,150 --> 02:22:22,460
one of my favorite clips ever,
just him on the tonight show.

3545
02:22:22,640 --> 02:22:26,040
There's a clip of him talking to Johnny
Carson in 1990 before he fought

3546
02:22:26,040 --> 02:22:28,020
Alex Stewart and take a minute and a
half.

3547
02:22:28,060 --> 02:22:31,680
It's just a funny like what a lovable
fun guy.

3548
02:22:31,950 --> 02:22:33,840
He was a different guy when he came back
for sure.

3549
02:22:33,841 --> 02:22:37,230
He became a preacher,
ballooned up to well over 300 pounds.

3550
02:22:37,560 --> 02:22:39,750
And what's really interesting is he made
his comeback,

3551
02:22:39,751 --> 02:22:43,770
I want to say he was 36 years old and
everybody thought it was a joke.

3552
02:22:43,771 --> 02:22:45,510
He was hugely fat,
like way,

3553
02:22:45,511 --> 02:22:47,190
way,
way overweight when he made his first

3554
02:22:47,191 --> 02:22:49,320
comeback fight.
And I remember as a boxing fan I was

3555
02:22:49,321 --> 02:22:49,681
like,
wow,

3556
02:22:49,681 --> 02:22:51,120
it's kind of sad.
Look on them.

3557
02:22:51,450 --> 02:22:56,450
And then slowly but surely over time his
body trimmed down and he got more muscle

3558
02:22:57,751 --> 02:23:00,510
and less fat.
And then he knocked Gerry Cooney the

3559
02:23:00,511 --> 02:23:01,980
fuck out.
And when he did that,

3560
02:23:01,981 --> 02:23:03,630
everybody went,
whoa.

3561
02:23:03,631 --> 02:23:06,030
He is for real.
Like this is crazy.

3562
02:23:06,360 --> 02:23:08,910
Like George Foreman,
not only is he for real,

3563
02:23:08,970 --> 02:23:12,530
he might be a better fighter than he was
when he was young and he fought.

3564
02:23:12,550 --> 02:23:14,910
I remember when he fought Evander
Holyfield and he lost.

3565
02:23:14,911 --> 02:23:16,120
I think he lost a decision.
Yeah,

3566
02:23:16,121 --> 02:23:18,540
you did it correctly.
I did and I love at the end he said

3567
02:23:18,541 --> 02:23:21,030
something about this is for people over
40 hip,

3568
02:23:21,031 --> 02:23:22,230
hip,
hooray.

3569
02:23:22,440 --> 02:23:26,310
That was such a great quote by will have
enough to lose the like what a victory

3570
02:23:26,311 --> 02:23:27,830
it was for,
for age.

3571
02:23:28,260 --> 02:23:30,450
You know,
there's really knocked out Michael

3572
02:23:30,450 --> 02:23:33,030
Moore,
I want to say he was 46 years old and

3573
02:23:33,031 --> 02:23:36,000
Michael Maura was beating him and
winning and he hit him with a straight

3574
02:23:36,001 --> 02:23:38,520
right hand on the Chin and more just
flattened.

3575
02:23:39,300 --> 02:23:40,350
It was crazy.
It was.

3576
02:23:40,351 --> 02:23:43,910
I think he was the oldest guy to ever
gained the heavyweight title at the

3577
02:23:43,911 --> 02:23:44,880
time.
Or do you feel the time?

3578
02:23:44,950 --> 02:23:46,230
What did he beat them for?
The title?

3579
02:23:46,290 --> 02:23:47,910
Think you'd beat Michael Moore for the
title.

3580
02:23:48,150 --> 02:23:49,120
He lost it.
The holyfield.

3581
02:23:49,170 --> 02:23:49,480
Is that what?

3582
02:23:49,480 --> 02:23:50,690
I don't remember him.
I think slept.

3583
02:23:50,760 --> 02:23:52,830
Having to pitch one more time.
One more time.

3584
02:23:52,831 --> 02:23:54,210
We'll wrap this thing up when you come
back.

3585
02:23:55,220 --> 02:23:59,820
I think what?
Find out how old George Foreman was when

3586
02:23:59,821 --> 02:24:01,770
he won the heavyweight title,
and here's the thing.

3587
02:24:02,100 --> 02:24:05,130
I don't think they had human growth or
if they did have human growth hormone.

3588
02:24:05,131 --> 02:24:08,700
It wasn't really being used by boxers.
I don't think they used to get human

3589
02:24:08,730 --> 02:24:11,910
growth hormone from the pituitary glands
of dead people.

3590
02:24:12,600 --> 02:24:14,820
He was 45,
45 when he won the title.

3591
02:24:14,850 --> 02:24:18,780
It'll be 26 year old Michael Moore.
Michael Moore was only 26 at the time.

3592
02:24:19,050 --> 02:24:21,420
Michael Moore was a murderer,
light heavyweight.

3593
02:24:21,660 --> 02:24:23,430
He was like one of the best light
heavyweights ever.

3594
02:24:23,940 --> 02:24:26,220
But light heavyweight was too hard for
him to make.

3595
02:24:26,221 --> 02:24:31,221
So we went up to heavyweight and uh,
that was when he won the title and then

3596
02:24:31,351 --> 02:24:35,640
who did he lose it,
lose it to Holyfield plus to Tommy,

3597
02:24:37,070 --> 02:24:41,220
Tommy Morrison to last a decision at
Tommy Marston was like Tommy Marson's

3598
02:24:41,221 --> 02:24:42,650
big biggest victory ever.

3599
02:24:44,900 --> 02:24:47,180
And that was like post a morrison was
lost,

3600
02:24:47,181 --> 02:24:50,360
was just before he beat Michael Moore.
Really interesting.

3601
02:24:50,710 --> 02:24:54,290
Unless Shannon Briggs,
he lost a decision to Shannon Briggs.

3602
02:24:54,500 --> 02:24:55,311
Shannon,
the cannon,

3603
02:24:55,311 --> 02:24:56,760
let's go champ.
Um,

3604
02:24:57,290 --> 02:25:01,840
and then I feel like the before to the
Shannon fight.

3605
02:25:01,870 --> 02:25:02,990
Oh,
it was before it as well.

3606
02:25:03,020 --> 02:25:03,411
Well,
it failed.

3607
02:25:03,411 --> 02:25:07,580
Last is 91.
Morrison was what is the,

3608
02:25:08,030 --> 02:25:11,810
what's the order of his fights?
So he had the holyfield loss,

3609
02:25:11,840 --> 02:25:14,420
the morrison loss,
and then right afterwards he got shot at

3610
02:25:14,421 --> 02:25:16,130
the title.
What it says.

3611
02:25:16,160 --> 02:25:18,020
That's crazy.
Why would they give them a shot at the

3612
02:25:18,021 --> 02:25:22,670
title right away to Los Angeles for the
vacant Wbo heavyweight title.

3613
02:25:22,790 --> 02:25:26,050
Then he won the WBA Ibf and lineal
heavyweight titles.

3614
02:25:26,051 --> 02:25:31,051
When he beat Michael Moore a,
beat him for the WBO title.

3615
02:25:32,290 --> 02:25:34,870
He lost that decision.
A lot of people thought that he should

3616
02:25:34,871 --> 02:25:36,610
have won the Shannon Briggs fight,
I believe.

3617
02:25:37,090 --> 02:25:39,190
Was the Shannon breaks fighter?
Was it the Morrison fight?

3618
02:25:39,310 --> 02:25:40,690
I'd have to go back and look at it
again.

3619
02:25:40,691 --> 02:25:42,550
I think maybe both of them were
controversial,

3620
02:25:43,240 --> 02:25:46,410
but uh,
the Morrison or the more fun as is

3621
02:25:46,411 --> 02:25:49,930
undisputed decision.
And a briggs was a mixed md.

3622
02:25:49,960 --> 02:25:52,810
Does that make decision or what does
that majority decision?

3623
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:54,100
That was briggs.
Yeah,

3624
02:25:54,101 --> 02:25:56,660
the breaks fight was the one,
I think that was controversial when

3625
02:25:56,740 --> 02:26:00,400
shannon braDy against George Foreman.
We're just going over the George Foreman

3626
02:26:00,401 --> 02:26:01,900
career.
Let's wrap this up.

3627
02:26:01,930 --> 02:26:02,621
Yeah,
this was fun,

3628
02:26:02,621 --> 02:26:03,640
dude.
I always enjoy.

3629
02:26:04,430 --> 02:26:06,160
What are you.
I haven't asked you one prediction

3630
02:26:06,161 --> 02:26:07,870
because I,
Anthony Johnson against,

3631
02:26:07,890 --> 02:26:09,550
uh,
against columbia.

3632
02:26:10,060 --> 02:26:11,980
Uh,
I do not have a prediction.

3633
02:26:11,981 --> 02:26:15,070
I never predict,
but I think that if it goes into the

3634
02:26:15,071 --> 02:26:16,690
third,
fourth and fifth rounds,

3635
02:26:16,691 --> 02:26:18,400
it's gonna be really hard for rumbled a
win.

3636
02:26:18,490 --> 02:26:20,710
Right?
I think rumbles chances of winning the

3637
02:26:20,711 --> 02:26:21,600
fight come early.

3638
02:26:21,600 --> 02:26:24,280
He's a,
he's a goddamn short term hurricane that

3639
02:26:24,281 --> 02:26:25,900
rips the house right out of the
foundation.

3640
02:26:25,930 --> 02:26:29,020
He's not necessarily a long,
long storm.

3641
02:26:29,940 --> 02:26:34,330
I think what rumbled does is comes at
you fast and hard and he can go fast and

3642
02:26:34,331 --> 02:26:37,270
hard rather than anybody.
It's just really hard for him to go with

3643
02:26:37,271 --> 02:26:39,250
that style.
More than three rounds.

3644
02:26:39,700 --> 02:26:41,740
The only time we've ever seen them do it
three rounds.

3645
02:26:41,741 --> 02:26:45,280
He beat phil davis,
beat the shit out of them for three

3646
02:26:45,281 --> 02:26:48,460
rounds.
But phil davis wasn't threatening him.

3647
02:26:48,970 --> 02:26:50,980
It was a.
He was fighting at his pace.

3648
02:26:51,220 --> 02:26:54,130
He was completely in control of that
fight and you want a clear cut,

3649
02:26:54,131 --> 02:26:56,590
unanimous decision,
hurt davis a bunch of times,

3650
02:26:56,591 --> 02:26:58,030
and it was super dangerous.
Also,

3651
02:26:58,210 --> 02:27:01,320
I feel like rumble johnson today scarier
than the rumble johnson,

3652
02:27:01,321 --> 02:27:05,470
the flat phil davis,
but rumble when he fought dc the first

3653
02:27:05,471 --> 02:27:08,620
time when he fought cormier the first
time he was preparing for jon jones,

3654
02:27:08,621 --> 02:27:12,130
so he's preparing for a different fight.
The fight was a last minute replacement

3655
02:27:12,131 --> 02:27:15,640
with cormier and cormier's.
Just a out wrestled them.

3656
02:27:15,660 --> 02:27:17,590
I mean daniel is one of the best
wrestlers in the sport.

3657
02:27:17,591 --> 02:27:19,450
Period out.
Wrestled them and then eventually got

3658
02:27:19,451 --> 02:27:24,220
his back and choked him.
I just think that it's a terrifying

3659
02:27:24,221 --> 02:27:28,250
fight for cormay because this fucking
guy hits so god hard.

3660
02:27:28,251 --> 02:27:30,970
He's fun.
If you make any mistakes and mistakes,

3661
02:27:30,971 --> 02:27:33,550
he lands a fucking nuclear bomb on your
face.

3662
02:27:36,250 --> 02:27:39,460
Be able to scare them.
Scare fighters.

3663
02:27:39,461 --> 02:27:41,390
The way that rumble does.
He has that.

3664
02:27:42,040 --> 02:27:46,320
He think that old school of afraid of
being beaten up in the school yard,

3665
02:27:46,620 --> 02:27:49,000
like when it could be beat Michael
Johnson the way you had it on the

3666
02:27:49,001 --> 02:27:50,710
ground.
That's how I would get beaten up,

3667
02:27:50,980 --> 02:27:53,380
like that was so claustrophobic for me
to watch that,

3668
02:27:53,590 --> 02:27:56,200
to like not be able to pull your arm.
Like that was a really uncomfortable

3669
02:27:56,201 --> 02:27:58,280
fight because it just can't.
I can't fight.

3670
02:27:58,300 --> 02:27:59,590
So yeah,
I wanted it stopped.

3671
02:28:00,070 --> 02:28:02,890
I wanted to stop before they stopped it.
It was bothering me.

3672
02:28:03,070 --> 02:28:04,360
I was like,
this guy's not going to win.

3673
02:28:04,361 --> 02:28:05,830
This fight is getting the fuck beat out
of him.

3674
02:28:05,831 --> 02:28:08,020
He's getting his head punched and he's
one of the best fighters in the world

3675
02:28:08,021 --> 02:28:10,390
and you're ruining them,
but he's just taking this beating.

3676
02:28:10,770 --> 02:28:12,370
Like just stop the god damn fight.

3677
02:28:12,600 --> 02:28:16,000
He was so outmatched,
but he did hurt habib early in the

3678
02:28:16,001 --> 02:28:18,480
fight.
He heard he hurt khabib in the first

3679
02:28:18,490 --> 02:28:21,920
round,
but then the fucking khabib not being

3680
02:28:21,921 --> 02:28:23,630
able to make the weight against tony
ferguson.

3681
02:28:23,631 --> 02:28:25,970
I'm just like this god damn weight
cutting god.

3682
02:28:25,971 --> 02:28:27,620
It's such a horrible,
horrible practice.

3683
02:28:27,621 --> 02:28:29,900
It makes me sick.
That was heartbreaking because everybody

3684
02:28:29,901 --> 02:28:32,270
wants that fight and now they say
they're going to be scared to put him

3685
02:28:32,271 --> 02:28:34,280
against conor.
I mean they're going to have that pair

3686
02:28:34,281 --> 02:28:35,540
of fucking main event.
You can't,

3687
02:28:35,780 --> 02:28:37,400
you can't,
and by the way,

3688
02:28:37,520 --> 02:28:41,420
one of the things that we've talked
about it on the fight companion podcast

3689
02:28:41,421 --> 02:28:43,570
we did the other day,
we pulled up the uh,

3690
02:28:43,790 --> 02:28:47,300
luke rockhold quote,
luke rockhold is his training partner

3691
02:28:47,570 --> 02:28:51,230
and he was saying that he couldn't get
blood to his liver and that was

3692
02:28:51,231 --> 02:28:51,800
something was going on.

3693
02:28:51,800 --> 02:28:53,960
He was in deep pain.
He wasn't getting blood to his liver.

3694
02:28:53,961 --> 02:28:54,441
I'm like,
yeah,

3695
02:28:54,441 --> 02:28:56,930
you fucking kidding me.
Like this guy and this guy is going to

3696
02:28:56,931 --> 02:28:59,360
do that again.
He's going to lose that weight again

3697
02:28:59,361 --> 02:29:02,030
after that.
And apparently he said that he had the

3698
02:29:02,031 --> 02:29:03,500
same problem in the Michael Johnson
fight,

3699
02:29:03,930 --> 02:29:07,010
the Michael Johnson fight.
He wound up getting down to 1:55,

3700
02:29:07,011 --> 02:29:09,920
but he was having the same issue where
it wasn't getting blood to his liver.

3701
02:29:09,950 --> 02:29:10,940
Like,
what the fuck,

3702
02:29:10,941 --> 02:29:12,320
man,
you know,

3703
02:29:12,321 --> 02:29:16,200
and george st pierre is did an interview
today where he's saying that it's going

3704
02:29:16,201 --> 02:29:18,380
to kill one of us.
Like one of us is gonna die from weight

3705
02:29:18,381 --> 02:29:19,700
cutting.
Lindsey's going to middleweight now.

3706
02:29:19,701 --> 02:29:21,230
Right.
I think that's one of the reasons why

3707
02:29:21,260 --> 02:29:22,160
it's better.
Yeah,

3708
02:29:22,220 --> 02:29:23,510
I think it's better.
I mean look out,

3709
02:29:23,511 --> 02:29:25,550
god damned good.
Calvin gasoline looked against or

3710
02:29:26,700 --> 02:29:27,140
faster.

3711
02:29:27,140 --> 02:29:28,390
Johny hendricks I thought looked good
too.

3712
02:29:28,450 --> 02:29:29,540
Yeah,
he looked great.

3713
02:29:29,750 --> 02:29:32,280
It looked great against hector lombard
getting heavy.

3714
02:29:32,290 --> 02:29:35,270
I makes you faster,
but I guess it's just not draining

3715
02:29:35,271 --> 02:29:36,710
yourself.
That's all it is because he's not

3716
02:29:36,711 --> 02:29:38,270
getting heavier.
He was always heavy.

3717
02:29:38,420 --> 02:29:41,840
He but he would be the same weight and
then dehydrate himself down to one 70

3718
02:29:41,960 --> 02:29:44,990
and then go back up to [inaudible] 90
somewhere around that,

3719
02:29:45,020 --> 02:29:49,100
which is what probably with johny
hendricks was instead this time just

3720
02:29:49,101 --> 02:29:53,210
last a couple of pounds.
Made one 85 easy and then look fucking

3721
02:29:53,211 --> 02:29:56,900
great against hector lombard.
I would like to see more guys do that

3722
02:29:56,901 --> 02:29:58,490
because I think that's so much
healthier.

3723
02:29:58,491 --> 02:30:01,320
So much and the performances are better.
Look at donald cerrone.

3724
02:30:01,400 --> 02:30:04,370
Donald's ronnie since going up to
welterweight looks far better than they

3725
02:30:04,371 --> 02:30:05,360
looked at lightweight.
Yeah.

3726
02:30:05,361 --> 02:30:07,850
I always wonder why they do that and
I've asked them before and they just

3727
02:30:07,851 --> 02:30:08,260
say,
look,

3728
02:30:08,260 --> 02:30:09,550
you're going to be fighting a heavier
guy.

3729
02:30:09,650 --> 02:30:10,940
I like,
why don't you just fight it?

3730
02:30:10,941 --> 02:30:14,030
Your normal kind of your weighT,
your walk around now,

3731
02:30:14,031 --> 02:30:16,490
wouldn't it be better and not have to
cut all that weight and put it back on?

3732
02:30:16,491 --> 02:30:17,630
It just seems crazy.
Honestly.

3733
02:30:17,631 --> 02:30:19,430
In their defense,
I think there should be more weight

3734
02:30:19,431 --> 02:30:21,620
classes.
I think there should be a weight class

3735
02:30:21,621 --> 02:30:23,960
every 10 pounds.
I think if there was a waY class every

3736
02:30:23,961 --> 02:30:26,600
10 pounds,
it would alleviate a lot of the extreme

3737
02:30:26,601 --> 02:30:28,490
cutting.
You'd have a 1:45,

3738
02:30:28,491 --> 02:30:30,560
1:55,
one 65 slash 75,

3739
02:30:30,590 --> 02:30:32,750
85,
95 and then go up like that.

3740
02:30:33,230 --> 02:30:35,510
I think if we did that,
we'd have more champions.

3741
02:30:35,511 --> 02:30:39,320
It would be more exciting.
I think it would be an excellent way to

3742
02:30:39,710 --> 02:30:43,040
have a champion versus champion fights
because he wouldn't be that much much

3743
02:30:43,041 --> 02:30:43,701
closer.
Right,

3744
02:30:43,701 --> 02:30:44,490
right,
right.

3745
02:30:44,490 --> 02:30:45,111
Yeah.
Yeah.

3746
02:30:45,111 --> 02:30:47,060
That would be interesting to watch.
Maybe that maybe they'll do it.

3747
02:30:47,060 --> 02:30:47,900
I mean,
I hope so.

3748
02:30:47,930 --> 02:30:51,160
Sixty five versus 75 pound champ.
Fifty five versus 65.

3749
02:30:51,161 --> 02:30:53,690
There's a lot of fights you can make
when you have these big ass super

3750
02:30:53,691 --> 02:30:56,200
fights.
That one guy could go up a little down a

3751
02:30:56,220 --> 02:30:57,440
little.
It's not a giant,

3752
02:30:57,441 --> 02:30:59,120
a giant jump.
Yeah.

3753
02:30:59,540 --> 02:31:01,400
I felt bad for tony ferguson and it just
sucks.

3754
02:31:01,490 --> 02:31:03,500
It does suck.
You're going to come up to the buffalo

3755
02:31:03,501 --> 02:31:04,910
fight.
Um,

3756
02:31:04,911 --> 02:31:06,760
I don't know if I'm working for,
uh,

3757
02:31:06,820 --> 02:31:07,420
for uh,
for uh,

3758
02:31:07,420 --> 02:31:08,540
courtenay johnson and buffalo,
right?

3759
02:31:08,600 --> 02:31:09,260
Yeah.
Yeah.

3760
02:31:09,260 --> 02:31:10,220
If I can,
I will.

3761
02:31:10,230 --> 02:31:13,250
I usually go to vegas,
but that's what I want to see is that is

3762
02:31:13,251 --> 02:31:15,590
a,
is a yoga every guest that to 11

3763
02:31:17,340 --> 02:31:20,550
years to 11.
I think this is a,

3764
02:31:20,551 --> 02:31:25,551
it's a win against
weidman versus saucy is a great fight.

3765
02:31:26,810 --> 02:31:28,980
oliveira is another one.
He went up to 1:55.

3766
02:31:28,981 --> 02:31:30,630
He's fighting well brooks now I liked
that.

3767
02:31:31,370 --> 02:31:32,760
Um,
yeah,

3768
02:31:32,820 --> 02:31:34,020
that's all.
Vera has been.

3769
02:31:34,021 --> 02:31:37,860
Just struggling to stay at 1:45.
Just brutal breaks you down man.

3770
02:31:37,861 --> 02:31:39,420
It's just so bad for you.
Yeah.

3771
02:31:39,421 --> 02:31:42,360
He didn't even miSs a thursday over.
He.

3772
02:31:42,361 --> 02:31:43,950
Um,
no.

3773
02:31:43,951 --> 02:31:46,890
He beat pedis.
Pedis didn't make the weight and he beat

3774
02:31:46,891 --> 02:31:48,120
pettis.
No,

3775
02:31:48,121 --> 02:31:50,670
that was max holloway.
Max holloway beat pettis.

3776
02:31:51,180 --> 02:31:54,870
He lost to pedes pedes guillotined him.
Uh,

3777
02:31:54,930 --> 02:31:56,890
But I think he's had a couple losses in
a row.

3778
02:31:56,891 --> 02:32:00,900
Who the fuck was posing as last loss he
wasn't met at recently?

3779
02:32:00,901 --> 02:32:04,260
Who criticized his weight that I think
it made me nothing going to.

3780
02:32:04,560 --> 02:32:06,150
He was,
they're pissed off that somebody had

3781
02:32:06,151 --> 02:32:07,410
said something disrespectful.
That is.

3782
02:32:07,411 --> 02:32:07,861
Wait.
Oh,

3783
02:32:07,861 --> 02:32:09,180
he lost to ricardo.
Lamas.

3784
02:32:09,210 --> 02:32:10,780
You got.
He got submitted by ricardo lamas.

3785
02:32:10,781 --> 02:32:13,680
So it was a great fight for llamas.
And then before that pet submitted them.

3786
02:32:14,250 --> 02:32:16,140
And then before that he beat miles.

3787
02:32:16,140 --> 02:32:17,190
Jury.
He's just,

3788
02:32:17,191 --> 02:32:18,230
um,
I think it's just,

3789
02:32:18,310 --> 02:32:21,090
it's another one of those Guys just,
he's a really talented guy,

3790
02:32:21,091 --> 02:32:23,730
but that fucking weight cut is just
horrible.

3791
02:32:23,910 --> 02:32:26,130
It's the worst part of the sport.
There should be a way to do it,

3792
02:32:26,580 --> 02:32:28,980
to eliminate it.
I think they should be weighing these

3793
02:32:28,981 --> 02:32:32,400
guys in every Fifteen days or something
like that and finding out what they

3794
02:32:32,401 --> 02:32:34,680
really way.
And I think it's crazy.

3795
02:32:34,740 --> 02:32:37,740
I really do.
I think it's insane to dehydrate your

3796
02:32:37,741 --> 02:32:39,030
brain,
your body,

3797
02:32:39,540 --> 02:32:42,540
get to death's door than 24 hours later
have a cage fight.

3798
02:32:42,630 --> 02:32:43,860
Gsp said there,
he said I didn't.

3799
02:32:43,861 --> 02:32:46,920
I didn't know they did that in boxing
and he was saying about inboxing a month

3800
02:32:46,921 --> 02:32:47,490
out.
They waste,

3801
02:32:47,490 --> 02:32:49,420
you can't lose like 20 percent of your
whatever the percentage of body.

3802
02:32:50,100 --> 02:32:51,960
I never considered that,
but that Would probably be a good way to

3803
02:32:51,961 --> 02:32:52,620
do it.

3804
02:32:52,620 --> 02:32:54,930
Maybe they will.
There's the guy who runs the California

3805
02:32:54,931 --> 02:32:57,180
state athletic commission.
His name is andy foster and he's

3806
02:32:57,181 --> 02:32:58,530
probably,
in my opinion,

3807
02:32:58,531 --> 02:33:02,730
one of the very best commissioners in in
mma today in athletic commission

3808
02:33:02,731 --> 02:33:05,490
commissioners because he's just really
proactive.

3809
02:33:05,491 --> 02:33:07,620
I believe he's had some mma fights
himself and he's,

3810
02:33:07,650 --> 02:33:11,280
he's an accomplished martial artists.
He really understands the sport and

3811
02:33:11,310 --> 02:33:13,230
they're doing.
They're taking some really proactive

3812
02:33:13,231 --> 02:33:16,140
approaches to cutting weight,
cutting and making sure that people

3813
02:33:16,620 --> 02:33:18,620
don't dehydrate themselves as much.
And he,

3814
02:33:18,640 --> 02:33:22,560
he was really proactive and for
performance enhancinG drugs,

3815
02:33:22,561 --> 02:33:27,060
catching people doing drugs beFore.
The usada thing with the ufc came along

3816
02:33:27,061 --> 02:33:29,850
too,
so just need better regulations,

3817
02:33:29,940 --> 02:33:32,640
more people on top of things.
This is how bad I want to lose my gut.

3818
02:33:32,900 --> 02:33:35,460
I felt like I do exercise if I actually,
uh,

3819
02:33:35,730 --> 02:33:36,850
I think I asked,
uh,

3820
02:33:36,851 --> 02:33:40,910
it was either wonderful or his father,
what the pace was that they put on and a

3821
02:33:40,920 --> 02:33:44,190
part of me actually considered putting
the paste on and just sitting in the

3822
02:33:44,191 --> 02:33:46,680
fucking in abilene to thank you.

3823
02:33:46,680 --> 02:33:48,120
I didn't know what to sweat.
Yeah.

3824
02:33:48,121 --> 02:33:48,890
But he's Like,
you don't want it.

3825
02:33:48,890 --> 02:33:50,130
That's 30.
You'll lose the wrong way.

3826
02:33:50,760 --> 02:33:52,280
No,
you'll just get dehydrated.

3827
02:33:52,320 --> 02:33:56,310
That's not going to lose body fat.
You just got to stop eating sugar.

3828
02:33:56,311 --> 02:33:57,750
Do you sugar?
Very rarely,

3829
02:33:57,751 --> 02:34:01,350
but occasionally I'm doing,
I go the only fucking two periods.

3830
02:34:01,650 --> 02:34:03,540
You know what I mean?
Like I want to misbehave and I'll just

3831
02:34:03,541 --> 02:34:05,490
shove bad food.
My fat face.

3832
02:34:05,810 --> 02:34:08,120
Hard not to tasty.
Tasty.

3833
02:34:08,280 --> 02:34:10,920
I love a good treat.
I love a good ice cream sundae.

3834
02:34:11,090 --> 02:34:12,390
I have a hard time.
Damn it,

3835
02:34:12,391 --> 02:34:13,410
dude.
I love it.

3836
02:34:13,500 --> 02:34:14,670
Woo.
Frozen yogurt.

3837
02:34:14,671 --> 02:34:16,920
Oh my fucking manager.
And what a couple of.

3838
02:34:17,260 --> 02:34:18,040
We looked like prancing

3839
02:34:18,040 --> 02:34:20,080
on santa monica boulevard to the Yogurt
stop.

3840
02:34:20,190 --> 02:34:21,430
Fuck it.
Three times a week.

3841
02:34:21,760 --> 02:34:25,290
We can't stop eating this cheese.
It's the fucking best.

3842
02:34:26,350 --> 02:34:30,100
They have the sugar free chocolate.
Holy shit.

3843
02:34:30,101 --> 02:34:32,200
Is that to get all those toppings?
I do.

3844
02:34:32,201 --> 02:34:36,760
I'm reese's pieces crazy.
I'll maybe a little bit of coconut

3845
02:34:36,761 --> 02:34:38,410
shavings,
but lately I've done more.

3846
02:34:38,590 --> 02:34:40,990
I rarely do.
I rarely do it,

3847
02:34:40,991 --> 02:34:44,080
but when I do it I go hard.
I go to cold stone creamery and get a

3848
02:34:44,081 --> 02:34:49,081
fucking giant sub with like peanut
butter and hot fudge and reese's pieces

3849
02:34:49,931 --> 02:34:54,931
and chocolate ice cream and whipped
cream on it and god dammit doesn't that.

3850
02:34:54,941 --> 02:34:56,590
Doesn't that fuck you.
I felt like my throat,

3851
02:34:58,960 --> 02:35:02,380
my throat clearing idiot and that type
of stuff fucks me up like lactose.

3852
02:35:02,381 --> 02:35:05,140
I can't take coffee.
I think mess in my throat up.

3853
02:35:05,200 --> 02:35:07,300
Last time I throw it,
I stoppeD drinking butter,

3854
02:35:07,301 --> 02:35:10,630
coffee on the show because I would drink
it and I would be constantly coughing.

3855
02:35:10,840 --> 02:35:13,480
It's just when you're talking for long
periods of time like this,

3856
02:35:13,760 --> 02:35:16,990
you occasionally going to have to clear
your throat like that.

3857
02:35:17,140 --> 02:35:18,480
Yeah.
But I mean like when I,

3858
02:35:18,520 --> 02:35:21,040
when I think about it more,
I have to do it more,

3859
02:35:21,340 --> 02:35:23,270
but I mean when uh,
when I'm like,

3860
02:35:23,320 --> 02:35:24,870
lactose fucking kills me.
Ice cream,

3861
02:35:24,880 --> 02:35:26,980
frozen yogurt,
yogurt too.

3862
02:35:27,010 --> 02:35:29,170
There's so much.
When you have an ice cream sundae mean

3863
02:35:29,180 --> 02:35:31,420
you're getting.
Who knows how many hundreds of grams of

3864
02:35:31,421 --> 02:35:33,190
sugar,
but it feels so good.

3865
02:35:33,191 --> 02:35:34,480
Well,
it's going in and then you just.

3866
02:35:36,100 --> 02:35:37,350
Then you regret it.
yeah.

3867
02:35:37,360 --> 02:35:39,910
Your body feels like dog shit for a long
time.

3868
02:35:39,930 --> 02:35:42,400
For an hour or so afterWards.
I feel like dog shit.

3869
02:35:42,430 --> 02:35:45,250
I feel I feel that way for a few days.
Like I gotta I gotta eat good for a

3870
02:35:45,251 --> 02:35:46,790
while,
go to the gym and then when I started

3871
02:35:46,810 --> 02:35:47,710
this I've never had an attitude.

3872
02:35:47,710 --> 02:35:49,750
I never will,
but I want to have abs.

3873
02:35:49,751 --> 02:35:51,490
You're not far away from amps.
I don't know.

3874
02:35:51,520 --> 02:35:53,740
When you have a real trainer,
like a really good trainer.

3875
02:35:53,741 --> 02:35:55,780
That fucking kicks your ass.
You got to check that.

3876
02:35:55,781 --> 02:35:58,150
You go to three different ones.
Three different ones.

3877
02:35:58,180 --> 02:35:59,020
One,
uh,

3878
02:35:59,021 --> 02:36:01,360
yeah.
Well one couldn't do another schedule so

3879
02:36:01,361 --> 02:36:02,950
I use another one.
One monday,

3880
02:36:02,951 --> 02:36:04,600
one friday and they want to use tuesday,
thursday.

3881
02:36:04,601 --> 02:36:06,580
So I'll schedule.
So every time you work out you workout

3882
02:36:06,640 --> 02:36:07,870
with a trainer.
Every time.

3883
02:36:08,200 --> 02:36:10,310
Unless I'm here and I'll do a little
something,

3884
02:36:10,311 --> 02:36:12,490
I'll pop up on the old elliptical for 20
minutes.

3885
02:36:12,920 --> 02:36:16,210
We all drove through a few things that
I've remembered do 45 minutes by myself,

3886
02:36:16,211 --> 02:36:19,060
but I would say almost every time I use
a trainer because I don't like.

3887
02:36:19,390 --> 02:36:21,340
I'm fucking lazy.
I'm lazy.

3888
02:36:21,341 --> 02:36:24,550
I like to be fucking lazy.
They will at least make you do different

3889
02:36:24,580 --> 02:36:27,020
shit squad,
you know,

3890
02:36:27,030 --> 02:36:29,980
like all these full body exercises I'm
doing things I wouldn't do on my own.

3891
02:36:30,010 --> 02:36:31,390
It's interesting that you say you're
lazy,

3892
02:36:31,391 --> 02:36:33,790
but you work out four days a week.
That's not lazy.

3893
02:36:33,850 --> 02:36:36,730
I do that in spite of my laziness.
Like I am lazy.

3894
02:36:36,970 --> 02:36:39,160
You do stand up seven nights a week,
but you're lAzy.

3895
02:36:39,370 --> 02:36:41,080
You do your radio show how many days a
week,

3896
02:36:41,081 --> 02:36:42,670
five days a week,
but you're lazy.

3897
02:36:42,830 --> 02:36:45,550
You do your podcast on top of the radio
show two days a week,

3898
02:36:45,551 --> 02:36:46,810
but you're lazy.
Yeah.

3899
02:36:46,811 --> 02:36:47,890
It's weird I think,
but I.

3900
02:36:47,891 --> 02:36:49,010
Maybe I,
maybe I,

3901
02:36:49,030 --> 02:36:49,870
maybe.
Maybe I'm not.

3902
02:36:49,880 --> 02:36:53,410
I always feel like I'm a lazy bum and I
really do.

3903
02:36:53,580 --> 02:36:57,640
I feel like I'm a fucking hard and I'm
doing all this stuff in spite of being

3904
02:36:57,641 --> 02:36:59,830
lazy,
like I'm fighting laziness constantly.

3905
02:36:59,860 --> 02:37:03,220
Maybe it's the way you're defining maybe
your self defining yourself in a very

3906
02:37:03,580 --> 02:37:07,510
negative and limiting way.
Maybe by thinking that like you're lazy.

3907
02:37:07,511 --> 02:37:09,700
Even though the evidence points to the
contrary,

3908
02:37:09,701 --> 02:37:12,850
you're still doing all these things.
A lazy person would find a way to not

3909
02:37:12,851 --> 02:37:15,040
work out.
A lazy person would find a way to fuck

3910
02:37:15,050 --> 02:37:16,010
off and call in sick

3911
02:37:16,010 --> 02:37:17,720
to the radio show a point.
Yeah.

3912
02:37:17,721 --> 02:37:19,970
I don't think you're lazy.
I think your self critical,

3913
02:37:19,971 --> 02:37:22,460
which is usually what a lot of artists
are,

3914
02:37:22,710 --> 02:37:24,830
you know,
a lot of artists hate everything they do

3915
02:37:24,860 --> 02:37:25,910
and they Just,
you know,

3916
02:37:25,911 --> 02:37:29,300
they're constantly trying to do the best
and it just never good enough and they

3917
02:37:29,301 --> 02:37:30,790
get pissed,
you know?

3918
02:37:30,830 --> 02:37:34,280
So it might be like this way you're
looking at things,

3919
02:37:34,610 --> 02:37:38,000
you might have to blank that out and
just not think like that.

3920
02:37:38,180 --> 02:37:40,010
Just not allow those thoughts to get
into your head.

3921
02:37:40,011 --> 02:37:42,470
Like if I wanted to fuck off and not
work out,

3922
02:37:42,471 --> 02:37:44,420
I'm sure I could come up with some sort
of a reason,

3923
02:37:44,421 --> 02:37:47,690
but I don't,
I don't consider myself lazy in that

3924
02:37:47,691 --> 02:37:50,690
regard.
I'm just not a workout too much.

3925
02:37:50,720 --> 02:37:52,700
It would be ridiculous if I said I was
lazy.

3926
02:37:53,130 --> 02:37:56,480
I make myself do it with a trainer that
also forCes you to do it.

3927
02:37:56,480 --> 02:37:58,020
But I made myself do it too.
Like it's,

3928
02:37:58,040 --> 02:37:59,900
there's no,
not much difference between you and me

3929
02:37:59,901 --> 02:38:02,020
in that regard.
I'll give myself a few days like,

3930
02:38:02,021 --> 02:38:03,830
well,
I'm still busy doing press this week.

3931
02:38:03,831 --> 02:38:05,390
I would give myself,
like I did it twice,

3932
02:38:05,391 --> 02:38:07,190
but uh,
I'll let the third day go.

3933
02:38:07,191 --> 02:38:09,230
Like I'm not as driven as I was at one
point,

3934
02:38:09,500 --> 02:38:10,910
bUt the trainers,
I always show up.

3935
02:38:10,911 --> 02:38:12,890
I never don't show up.
I don't cut.

3936
02:38:12,891 --> 02:38:14,860
The workouts are like,
you just make yourself dillard.

3937
02:38:14,900 --> 02:38:16,820
It sounds like baking shall be faithful.
Like,

3938
02:38:16,821 --> 02:38:18,140
you know,
once I start cheating,

3939
02:38:18,380 --> 02:38:20,390
goodbye.
That's all shades are open.

3940
02:38:20,420 --> 02:38:22,620
Floodgates are open because I'm no
longer perfect.

3941
02:38:23,080 --> 02:38:24,710
Cd shit comes in.
I'm not perfect.

3942
02:38:26,830 --> 02:38:28,820
I think that's what you're doing.
I think you're defining.

3943
02:38:28,850 --> 02:38:32,300
I think it's a negative definition that
you've latched onto yourself,

3944
02:38:32,301 --> 02:38:36,170
that you're lazy because it's impossible
for you to be lazy when you look at all

3945
02:38:36,171 --> 02:38:38,240
the things you do.
That's a good point.

3946
02:38:38,241 --> 02:38:39,530
I hadn't thought of it that way.
That's a good point.

3947
02:38:39,560 --> 02:38:41,450
Yeah.
I've always identified myself like that.

3948
02:38:41,451 --> 02:38:44,000
Maybe I'm just a driven guy who's tired.
Yeah,

3949
02:38:44,020 --> 02:38:45,430
that sounds like.
I mean,

3950
02:38:45,440 --> 02:38:47,050
jesus christ.
Think about all the shit you're doing.

3951
02:38:47,060 --> 02:38:49,730
You're doIng five days of radio.
You're doing two days a podcast.

3952
02:38:49,910 --> 02:38:52,370
You're doing standup every night.
You're working at night and then you're

3953
02:38:52,371 --> 02:38:54,410
getting up in the morning to do radio.
What?

3954
02:38:54,411 --> 02:38:56,960
Seven?
What time be there from eight to 11.

3955
02:38:57,200 --> 02:38:58,850
Eight to 11.
So you're getting up at seven?

3956
02:38:58,870 --> 02:39:01,400
Yeah,
that's fucking early for a comic.

3957
02:39:02,010 --> 02:39:03,960
doing a set at night.
Like what time is your set?

3958
02:39:04,050 --> 02:39:06,740
I usually stl giving the early ones when
I requested it,

3959
02:39:06,741 --> 02:39:10,890
so I'm usually done by about 8:30.
I'd be home by nine.

3960
02:39:10,990 --> 02:39:13,460
A little something to yell some
vietnamese food and relax.

3961
02:39:13,550 --> 02:39:14,211
Yeah,
but still,

3962
02:39:14,211 --> 02:39:18,050
even then like you're barely getting
eight hours sleep then if you go right

3963
02:39:18,051 --> 02:39:19,190
to bed.
I never get a dollar,

3964
02:39:19,220 --> 02:39:21,890
so that's what I'm saying.
can you maybe you need.

3965
02:39:21,980 --> 02:39:23,720
Everybody needs eight hours.
I like eight.

3966
02:39:23,721 --> 02:39:27,800
I got eight hours last night.
So you feel refreshed when you wake up.

3967
02:39:27,820 --> 02:39:30,140
You feel great to feel refreshed.
I feel amazing.

3968
02:39:30,640 --> 02:39:33,080
I feel fantastic.
It was to get that eight hours.

3969
02:39:33,110 --> 02:39:36,170
I just think that that's one of those
things is non negotiable.

3970
02:39:36,380 --> 02:39:38,660
I just think that.
I mean there's gonna be days where I

3971
02:39:38,661 --> 02:39:41,330
can't I gotta get up early for a flight
or whatever.

3972
02:39:41,331 --> 02:39:44,340
Yeah.
But I think sleep is one of the most non

3973
02:39:44,341 --> 02:39:45,330
negotiable things.

3974
02:39:45,330 --> 02:39:48,410
Sleeping and drinking water and eating
healthy food,

3975
02:39:48,440 --> 02:39:50,330
those are pretty non negotiable with.
Have you heard of?

3976
02:39:50,331 --> 02:39:52,430
It depends.
Last nIght it was pretty late.

3977
02:39:52,640 --> 02:39:54,500
Last night was probably like 1:00 in the
morning.

3978
02:39:54,501 --> 02:39:57,500
I got up at a like somewhere around nine
ish.

3979
02:39:58,320 --> 02:40:00,140
That's still.
That's still a good schedule for a

3980
02:40:00,141 --> 02:40:02,030
comedian,
for comedians.

3981
02:40:02,031 --> 02:40:04,610
Great.
Well it's good that the store's not far

3982
02:40:04,611 --> 02:40:06,590
away.
I couldn't get to the store and a half

3983
02:40:06,591 --> 02:40:08,750
an hour at night,
get there and do a set.

3984
02:40:08,780 --> 02:40:10,550
I'm done by 11,
1130.

3985
02:40:10,551 --> 02:40:12,350
I'm home by one,
you know,

3986
02:40:12,351 --> 02:40:13,930
whatever.
That's what scared me though.

3987
02:40:13,931 --> 02:40:14,010
It

3988
02:40:14,010 --> 02:40:18,840
was the idea of doing radio during the
day and then like I did afternoons I do,

3989
02:40:18,841 --> 02:40:21,410
I set at night and then one and then
you.

3990
02:40:21,450 --> 02:40:23,790
Then you're naughty.
That's what you're wearing and.

3991
02:40:23,800 --> 02:40:26,490
And nobody's around.
Nobody is around.

3992
02:40:26,520 --> 02:40:26,940
But you,
you,

3993
02:40:26,940 --> 02:40:29,400
you're really texting the dregs at 4:00
AM right here.

3994
02:40:29,460 --> 02:40:30,051
Yeah.
You bet.

3995
02:40:30,051 --> 02:40:31,200
Choy,
your best options.

3996
02:40:31,201 --> 02:40:34,620
I've gone to bed.
You don't have the best,

3997
02:40:34,621 --> 02:40:36,230
best opposite.
Taken all the loads.

3998
02:40:36,250 --> 02:40:38,790
They can handle it or they have.
They've given them.

3999
02:40:40,390 --> 02:40:43,680
she's really good girl.
Alright.

4000
02:40:44,670 --> 02:40:46,980
Jim norton.
You new special is on netflix.

4001
02:40:47,040 --> 02:40:48,120
Mouthful of shame.
Yeah,

4002
02:40:48,121 --> 02:40:51,080
it's on a as of today.
There it is.

4003
02:40:51,081 --> 02:40:52,980
bam.
Well you look great in that picture.

4004
02:40:53,020 --> 02:40:55,430
Oh shit dude.
There's a snow storm.

4005
02:40:55,440 --> 02:40:57,510
I actually just pulled that.
I actually just screen cap that because

4006
02:40:57,511 --> 02:40:59,050
I didn't like the pixel using.
Sorry.

4007
02:40:59,060 --> 02:41:00,970
I just screamed and especially could you
guys use that?

4008
02:41:00,970 --> 02:41:01,770
And I'm like,
okay,

4009
02:41:01,770 --> 02:41:02,850
perfect.
Yeah,

4010
02:41:02,851 --> 02:41:03,570
that is,
it's.

4011
02:41:03,570 --> 02:41:06,150
I liked that too because you're in the
middle of a set,

4012
02:41:06,840 --> 02:41:08,550
you know,
like that's a real picture.

4013
02:41:08,580 --> 02:41:11,940
That's a real like you're not posing
like I posed for a bunch of netflix

4014
02:41:11,941 --> 02:41:13,200
pictures,
pictures and I was like,

4015
02:41:14,070 --> 02:41:17,010
well there's one they took of me where
my hands over my mouth,

4016
02:41:17,011 --> 02:41:19,440
but it's a screen grab from the set.
I'm doing a joke right?

4017
02:41:19,450 --> 02:41:21,080
Cover my mouth,
but I'm like,

4018
02:41:21,090 --> 02:41:23,610
I don't want to use that a because you
can't see my face and be.

4019
02:41:24,150 --> 02:41:26,520
Because I know it's a mouthful of shame,
but it seems like I'm going,

4020
02:41:26,521 --> 02:41:28,350
oh,
I said something naughty,

4021
02:41:28,351 --> 02:41:31,350
which is not what the joke is,
but it looks like I called it mouthful

4022
02:41:31,351 --> 02:41:32,610
of shame and that went,
oh,

4023
02:41:32,611 --> 02:41:35,400
look out folks.
It's fucking awful.

4024
02:41:35,430 --> 02:41:37,310
Yeah,
that could be a pRoblem if somebody was

4025
02:41:37,330 --> 02:41:38,910
centered,
cynical and they were like,

4026
02:41:38,911 --> 02:41:42,750
who's this guy the fuck out of here with
your mouth full to say whatever I want.

4027
02:41:43,020 --> 02:41:45,000
No one,
no one sensory me.

4028
02:41:45,090 --> 02:41:47,940
Isn't netflix amazing in that regard?
I could not be happier.

4029
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:49,320
So,
so amazing.

4030
02:41:49,970 --> 02:41:51,620
So good.
Robby process.

4031
02:41:52,290 --> 02:41:54,390
It wasn't.
It's an hour in one minute or hour and

4032
02:41:54,391 --> 02:41:55,950
two minutes.
It was an hour and 14 with a set.

4033
02:41:55,951 --> 02:41:58,010
I chopped the bid up and I asked robbie,
we,

4034
02:41:58,150 --> 02:42:00,720
you might want to turn this a bit,
but it's up to you and like this one

4035
02:42:00,721 --> 02:42:03,300
part and he was right.
The trim was actually smart and that

4036
02:42:03,301 --> 02:42:04,770
was,
that was the whole suggestion.

4037
02:42:05,100 --> 02:42:05,620
Yeah,
there was.

4038
02:42:05,620 --> 02:42:08,180
The only notes they gave me when I was
recording was like,

4039
02:42:08,190 --> 02:42:11,760
one of the ladies really enjoyed the
dolphin bit.

4040
02:42:11,800 --> 02:42:13,200
She's like,
you didn't do the dolphin bed on that

4041
02:42:13,220 --> 02:42:13,680
side.
Oh,

4042
02:42:13,680 --> 02:42:15,300
it's just because I did.
Don't worry,

4043
02:42:15,720 --> 02:42:16,620
it'll be on.
I go,

4044
02:42:16,621 --> 02:42:18,030
I just didn't want to do it during that
sec.

4045
02:42:18,031 --> 02:42:19,450
So it was,
I don't want to do.

4046
02:42:19,530 --> 02:42:22,530
I didn't want any of the sets to be
longer than an hour and some of them are

4047
02:42:22,531 --> 02:42:25,020
going to have material that's not in the
other ones that will decide which way to

4048
02:42:25,021 --> 02:42:26,460
do it,
but that was it.

4049
02:42:26,750 --> 02:42:28,200
Like I like a bit.
Yeah,

4050
02:42:28,420 --> 02:42:29,550
you're good.
Don't worry.

4051
02:42:29,551 --> 02:42:30,730
That bit's going to be in there.
Yeah.

4052
02:42:30,731 --> 02:42:32,280
So that's a nice note to get.
Yeah,

4053
02:42:32,340 --> 02:42:33,180
yeah,
yeah.

4054
02:42:33,390 --> 02:42:35,340
It's,
I think the best venue right now for

4055
02:42:35,341 --> 02:42:36,990
standup by far.
I don't think there's anything even

4056
02:42:36,991 --> 02:42:39,480
close to netflix.
It's everywhere now,

4057
02:42:39,670 --> 02:42:42,690
like didn't get released everywhere,
so I'll go out and do gigs,

4058
02:42:42,850 --> 02:42:45,660
hopefully in the next couple of months,
start booking a bunch of shit and

4059
02:42:45,661 --> 02:42:47,700
someone can listen to this podcast right
now,

4060
02:42:47,850 --> 02:42:51,150
hanging up it close,
close the podcast and then go right to

4061
02:42:51,151 --> 02:42:55,740
their tv and instantaneously watch it.
It's stats tHe best on their phone.

4062
02:42:55,800 --> 02:42:57,560
Yeah,
I opened it on my phone before.

4063
02:42:57,560 --> 02:42:59,040
It's weird.
It's amazing.

4064
02:42:59,070 --> 02:43:01,740
Like you're watching it on like even
like did they don't care about the

4065
02:43:01,741 --> 02:43:02,850
premiere,
like they care,

4066
02:43:03,180 --> 02:43:04,860
but like I had a bunch of stuff like
that,

4067
02:43:04,870 --> 02:43:06,060
but I never actually said,
you know,

4068
02:43:06,061 --> 02:43:08,460
don't kill yourself.
It's going to be a second wave.

4069
02:43:08,550 --> 02:43:10,740
You know how much press I did.
I did,

4070
02:43:12,210 --> 02:43:13,980
I did like I maybe I called a couple of
evil.

4071
02:43:13,990 --> 02:43:15,090
I don't remember.
It was,

4072
02:43:15,150 --> 02:43:16,090
it was nothing.
No,

4073
02:43:16,091 --> 02:43:19,180
it was nothing like I had to do for
comedy central comedy central involved

4074
02:43:19,181 --> 02:43:20,680
like there's like a bunch of
obligations.

4075
02:43:21,130 --> 02:43:23,200
If you do an hbo special,
I would imagine probably be the same

4076
02:43:23,201 --> 02:43:23,891
thing.
Same thing,

4077
02:43:23,891 --> 02:43:25,870
same for epics and again,
just because they have a premiere date,

4078
02:43:25,940 --> 02:43:27,430
they get numbers.
Yeah,

4079
02:43:27,710 --> 02:43:28,481
flakes.
They don't care.

4080
02:43:28,481 --> 02:43:31,030
They just want to know that people are
watching it and they can tell and I

4081
02:43:31,031 --> 02:43:34,210
don't tell any of us how many people are
watching us get numbers.

4082
02:43:34,490 --> 02:43:35,081
They.
Yeah,

4083
02:43:35,081 --> 02:43:36,250
they don't tell you shit.
They just go.

4084
02:43:36,251 --> 02:43:37,450
We're very,
very happy.

4085
02:43:37,510 --> 02:43:39,430
I want to do another one.
Yeah.

4086
02:43:39,460 --> 02:43:42,780
I should act like I'm holding out when
you want to do it on and I'm not ready

4087
02:43:42,781 --> 02:43:44,880
to happen.
I mean I would make in a year or

4088
02:43:44,880 --> 02:43:46,930
something more on the.
I would love to do it.

4089
02:43:46,931 --> 02:43:48,730
Then what's your schedule do you like to
do?

4090
02:43:48,731 --> 02:43:51,550
Do you like to do one a year?
It's not always possible,

4091
02:43:51,551 --> 02:43:53,680
but at my age my goal is to do one every
year,

4092
02:43:53,681 --> 02:43:58,120
year and a half maximum because by then
a lot of the material is like when I

4093
02:43:58,121 --> 02:44:01,900
touch topical stuff now I try to touch
it in a way that ties into an overall

4094
02:44:01,901 --> 02:44:05,290
theme so it still makes sense.
Like I talk about how I don't really

4095
02:44:05,291 --> 02:44:07,360
think I'm a pervert and I mentioned that
jared is a pervert,

4096
02:44:07,540 --> 02:44:08,510
but I don't do a whole long.

4097
02:44:08,520 --> 02:44:12,520
Jarrod said I'd like to have something
that is fairly timeless to that bit.

4098
02:44:12,580 --> 02:44:14,410
Nothing specific to the moment where
you're like,

4099
02:44:14,411 --> 02:44:15,244
wait,
I don't remember that.

4100
02:44:15,530 --> 02:44:17,860
You know what he did so that I.
Yeah,

4101
02:44:17,950 --> 02:44:20,350
but after a year and a half I just lose
interest in what I'm saying,

4102
02:44:20,351 --> 02:44:22,570
joke wise and that plus I liked doing
that.

4103
02:44:22,660 --> 02:44:24,130
YeaH,
I love doing that.

4104
02:44:24,131 --> 02:44:26,620
I feel like why not just put it out?
There's so many places to put specials

4105
02:44:26,621 --> 02:44:27,454
out.
Right?

4106
02:44:27,470 --> 02:44:29,470
And especially when you're doing so much
standup.

4107
02:44:29,471 --> 02:44:31,720
If you're doing standup six,
seven nights a week and then you're

4108
02:44:31,721 --> 02:44:34,420
constantly doing a radio show,
there's constantly new themes running

4109
02:44:34,421 --> 02:44:36,460
through your head.
You want to get that out there and it's

4110
02:44:36,461 --> 02:44:39,550
always there and it's like I may
actually do shorter videos or something.

4111
02:44:39,551 --> 02:44:42,480
I don't know how to get them out.
Like things that are so topical just to

4112
02:44:42,510 --> 02:44:43,450
just to spit them out there.

4113
02:44:43,450 --> 02:44:45,370
So they're there and they're posted
getting wasted in a set.

4114
02:44:45,460 --> 02:44:47,410
I want to be your self esteem coach.
I'm going to pump you up.

4115
02:44:47,650 --> 02:44:49,990
No more negative thinking,
positive gym,

4116
02:44:50,080 --> 02:44:52,810
but then again you might be fueled by
that negative thing and it might be why

4117
02:44:52,811 --> 02:44:54,850
you're so prolific.
It's a combination of both.

4118
02:44:54,880 --> 02:44:58,330
Like I could feel good and be funny too,
but I didn't even realize it was a

4119
02:44:58,331 --> 02:45:01,240
negative thought.
I just think I was confusing being tired

4120
02:45:01,720 --> 02:45:03,910
with being lazy and I think that's a
good.

4121
02:45:03,980 --> 02:45:05,770
You just pointed something out that
makes a lot of stuff.

4122
02:45:05,771 --> 02:45:07,780
DefInitely not lazy.
You got a lot of shit done.

4123
02:45:08,020 --> 02:45:09,040
Yeah,
I feel but I.

4124
02:45:09,150 --> 02:45:12,830
But I'll watch you and I see you.
You got a company you've got 30 during

4125
02:45:12,840 --> 02:45:14,710
the and I'm like motherfucker,
I'm sitting in,

4126
02:45:14,740 --> 02:45:16,570
I'm sitting on a block of ice doing
nothing.

4127
02:45:16,730 --> 02:45:18,280
what lilly's doing this area here.

4128
02:45:18,520 --> 02:45:20,920
You see all your friends comparing.
So no,

4129
02:45:20,921 --> 02:45:22,960
I know,
but if you feel lazy when you see your

4130
02:45:22,961 --> 02:45:26,200
friends doing these great things.
All the things that I'm doing though,

4131
02:45:26,201 --> 02:45:29,450
I really enjoyed doing those things so
they don't seem like work to me.

4132
02:45:29,451 --> 02:45:31,120
Like not.
There's not a goddamn thing I do that

4133
02:45:31,121 --> 02:45:33,070
seems like work,
whether it's working for the ufc,

4134
02:45:33,370 --> 02:45:35,950
whether it's students stand up,
there's obligations.

4135
02:45:36,110 --> 02:45:39,640
She'll have to be there to certain time.
There's writing involved.

4136
02:45:39,641 --> 02:45:42,330
There's things that I have to do where I
have to sit down and be alone and forced

4137
02:45:42,331 --> 02:45:44,500
myself to do that kind of work,
but it doesn't.

4138
02:45:44,520 --> 02:45:46,840
None of it seems like work.
It's all fun stuff.

4139
02:45:46,960 --> 02:45:48,250
Well,
if I was only doing stuff I want,

4140
02:45:48,251 --> 02:45:50,740
believe me,
I wish if somehow watching chatter bait

4141
02:45:50,741 --> 02:45:53,220
would advance me in this business,
you'd be fucking.

4142
02:45:53,380 --> 02:45:57,460
he'd be seeing my fucking heels and
probably if you did like live commentary

4143
02:45:57,461 --> 02:46:00,370
on twitch for chatter bait,
like you have chattery windows in the

4144
02:46:00,371 --> 02:46:02,650
background and you're.
You're just sitting there like old old

4145
02:46:02,651 --> 02:46:04,000
jesus.
You're not allowed to,

4146
02:46:04,001 --> 02:46:06,460
but I do.
What I do want to do is I want to get a

4147
02:46:06,461 --> 02:46:10,400
beautiful girl and chatter bait and then
I want to just come on as fucking chip

4148
02:46:10,401 --> 02:46:11,234
and sit next to her.

4149
02:46:13,610 --> 02:46:16,340
all these years,
jerking off in Portugal

4150
02:46:18,780 --> 02:46:20,570
has a great idea.
I want to do that.

4151
02:46:20,600 --> 02:46:21,940
Have the look and everything.
I really wanted,

4152
02:46:22,130 --> 02:46:24,590
but I would have to have somebody like
somehow capturing,

4153
02:46:24,800 --> 02:46:26,570
because you have to be careful.
You don't show them that you'll get

4154
02:46:26,571 --> 02:46:27,590
sued.
Like yeah,

4155
02:46:27,591 --> 02:46:30,170
there's a way to capture what they've
said and change it a little and put it

4156
02:46:30,171 --> 02:46:31,760
out.
I think it's so funny.

4157
02:46:31,920 --> 02:46:33,290
Oh,
you have to do it in conjunction with

4158
02:46:33,291 --> 02:46:34,880
that girl like you and the girl would
have to have.

4159
02:46:35,490 --> 02:46:38,240
The girl would be.
Would he be he be in the room with her

4160
02:46:38,480 --> 02:46:40,460
but she wouldn't be.
I can't do anything with porn,

4161
02:46:40,610 --> 02:46:42,710
but the girl will be like a sexy girl,
like showing her tits,

4162
02:46:42,711 --> 02:46:44,510
like really hot.
You can't do anythIng with foreign

4163
02:46:44,511 --> 02:46:45,550
because a serious no,
no.

4164
02:46:45,560 --> 02:46:46,940
Just because it was a committee.
I don't want to.

4165
02:46:46,970 --> 02:46:50,290
I don't want to cross a certain line.
Like I don't wanna I don't want to be

4166
02:46:50,291 --> 02:46:51,880
there while people.
I'm actually fucking right.

4167
02:46:52,490 --> 02:46:55,130
I'm not at a judgment,
but I just don't understand what you're

4168
02:46:55,131 --> 02:46:56,780
saying,
but I want to.

4169
02:46:56,781 --> 02:47:00,890
I want to have fucking chip come on and
just sit there and fucking spoil the

4170
02:47:00,980 --> 02:47:04,950
vines.
Fucking talk to show a fucking cooler.

4171
02:47:06,350 --> 02:47:10,940
People would be so fucking angry.
People like me wouldn't know you would

4172
02:47:10,941 --> 02:47:13,520
enjoy it,
but like could have like you put it in a

4173
02:47:13,521 --> 02:47:15,990
couple is so fun.
You wait.

4174
02:47:16,190 --> 02:47:19,290
I'm going to fuck the shit out of her
and a feel fucking seconds.

4175
02:47:20,070 --> 02:47:21,240
Great idea.
Yeah.

4176
02:47:21,260 --> 02:47:25,160
There was like a bib on mashed potatoes.
Yeah.

4177
02:47:25,161 --> 02:47:28,030
Where do you see how good I fucking it
and occluder

4178
02:47:30,290 --> 02:47:34,220
people would hate it.
Sounds like a plan.

4179
02:47:34,790 --> 02:47:35,830
Thank you man.
I appreciate it.

4180
02:47:35,831 --> 02:47:38,000
I love this podcast.
I love you man.

4181
02:47:38,001 --> 02:47:41,370
You're funny motherfucker.
Is this real silver versus gas tulum

4182
02:47:45,550 --> 02:47:48,260
in rio?
Oh my goodness.

4183
02:47:49,560 --> 02:47:52,110
Goodness.
Whoa.

4184
02:47:52,560 --> 02:47:55,440
Calvin gaslamp's.
He's trying to be the legend.

4185
02:47:55,441 --> 02:47:56,274
Killer.
Yeah.

4186
02:47:56,460 --> 02:47:57,750
Asking you shall receive.
Who's?

4187
02:47:57,751 --> 02:48:00,000
Who is tweeted that.
Oh wow.

4188
02:48:00,150 --> 02:48:02,250
Well,
calvin asked for that fight and anderson

4189
02:48:02,251 --> 02:48:05,430
apparently said yes.
That is a dangerous fight for anderson

4190
02:48:05,431 --> 02:48:07,870
silva.
Kelvin gasoline was a fucking destroys.

4191
02:48:07,880 --> 02:48:10,770
He is and they understand against our
parents and I thought was a very

4192
02:48:10,771 --> 02:48:12,630
interesting decision.
I didn't agree with it,

4193
02:48:12,631 --> 02:48:14,880
but other people did.
They said it wasn't a bad decision.

4194
02:48:14,881 --> 02:48:16,560
It wasn't.
It was a close fight.

4195
02:48:16,590 --> 02:48:18,360
It wasn't.
He didn't get a lot done,

4196
02:48:18,361 --> 02:48:22,110
but I felt like I'd have to go over it
and really score it,

4197
02:48:22,111 --> 02:48:24,840
but I didn't think it was agregious,
but I do think that anderson is

4198
02:48:24,841 --> 02:48:29,841
definitely lost a step and he can get
hit and calvin is a Motherfucker man.

4199
02:48:30,360 --> 02:48:32,040
He's a motherfucker.
Wow.

4200
02:48:32,100 --> 02:48:33,180
Wow.
In rio though.

4201
02:48:33,181 --> 02:48:36,200
He's going to fight anderson in rio.
the vibe in rio,

4202
02:48:36,540 --> 02:48:38,190
but he just fucked up.
Vitorin.

4203
02:48:38,191 --> 02:48:40,260
Fortaleza.
He knocked him the fuck out.

4204
02:48:40,270 --> 02:48:41,850
Yeah.
Jesus.

4205
02:48:41,880 --> 02:48:45,000
He doesn't seem to care where he is.
Him got islam is a beast.

4206
02:48:45,060 --> 02:48:47,400
He's a beast.
He's a kid on the way up.

4207
02:48:47,520 --> 02:48:48,720
He's only 25.
Two,

4208
02:48:48,721 --> 02:48:50,280
right?
How was that young?

4209
02:48:50,490 --> 02:48:51,570
I believe.
oh my god.

4210
02:48:51,571 --> 02:48:55,050
I believe he's 25.
I believe he won the ultimate fighter.

4211
02:48:55,051 --> 02:48:56,610
It's like one of the youngest guys ever
to win it.

4212
02:48:57,350 --> 02:48:59,290
Yeah.
Did he all.

4213
02:48:59,670 --> 02:49:00,620
It was right?
Yeah,

4214
02:49:01,460 --> 02:49:04,050
I remember watching him.
Nobody thought it was gonna win shit.

4215
02:49:04,260 --> 02:49:05,690
Now he's way ahead of you.
Right?

4216
02:49:06,290 --> 02:49:07,950
I love you too.
He's a beast.

4217
02:49:07,980 --> 02:49:09,120
He's another one.
Really good fighter.

4218
02:49:09,190 --> 02:49:11,460
He really interesting guy to.
Alright.
