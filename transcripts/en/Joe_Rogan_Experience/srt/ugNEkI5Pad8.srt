1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:04,050
The joe rogan experience.
Speaking of,

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,220
I dunno what we're speaking of,
but we need to talk about Kanye just,

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:09,750
oh,
Jamie's got crazy.

4
00:00:09,751 --> 00:00:13,320
Kanye conspiracy theories slash.
Theories.

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:14,663
Well,
first,

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,200
so first of all,
he's like,

7
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,980
he came out for trump recently.
He sort of,

8
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:23,280
he wore a make America great again hat
on,

9
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:28,350
but he also called trump a ball thief.
Why suddenly too?

10
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:29,170
He did.
Yeah.

11
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:30,270
Yeah.
Well,

12
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,470
yeah,
he called them balled crook or a

13
00:00:32,471 --> 00:00:35,760
appalled named Connie is a lunatic.
Yeah.

14
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,650
So I could care less what he says about
him.

15
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:41,220
He loves saying,
Jamie Sleeps with a picture of Cognac.

16
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,530
Stop.
Stop.

17
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,260
I don't believe that.
She didn't to believe that.

18
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,113
Yes.
Come on.

19
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,170
People believe everything you're saying
about me.

20
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:52,680
It's not a,
it's a pendant with a picture with his

21
00:00:52,681 --> 00:00:55,260
picture in it.
Jamie's a big fan of two things.

22
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,030
Nuclear Weapons and trump.

23
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,240
He's,
yeah,

24
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,700
he loves nuclear bombs and he loves
physics class.

25
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,870
Yeah.
So trump before,

26
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,800
here's,
here's what,

27
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,870
here's what I like.
Well,

28
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,630
Connie is a lunatic,
but I do like candace owens who was also

29
00:01:15,631 --> 00:01:18,780
new on the scene and my Fox News world.
You love that.

30
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,380
I love you love conservatives and
candace is just like,

31
00:01:22,381 --> 00:01:27,180
she walked in from work the other day
and I was like started listening to Fox

32
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,410
News is on.
Of course I'm watching.

33
00:01:28,411 --> 00:01:30,510
I'm like,
who the hell is this?

34
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,980
You Say Fox News is on of course,
because Fox News just blaring propaganda

35
00:01:34,981 --> 00:01:38,070
through your house all the time.
Do you ever switch it up like have like

36
00:01:38,071 --> 00:01:41,220
CNN on the back?
Nine Fox News on in the living room.

37
00:01:41,221 --> 00:01:43,410
I watch it.
I do watch CNN.

38
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,440
Alex Jones says 200 1:30 PM to watch him
for wars.

39
00:01:46,441 --> 00:01:49,750
Exclusive on Canyon.
Candice and Kanye exclusive.

40
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,270
I don't,
it doesn't happen every year.

41
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,640
It's like alive.
What does he get to say?

42
00:01:53,641 --> 00:01:57,600
Featuring candice and Kanye,
so I need a lump them in together,

43
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,840
but he talking about them.
Everyone thought they were going to be

44
00:02:00,841 --> 00:02:05,660
on this show together is exclusive.
He probably called them Kanye.

45
00:02:05,661 --> 00:02:08,280
It's Alex Jones.
I could care less that Connie says.

46
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,820
I like what canvas says,
you chop one of my legs off and it's me

47
00:02:11,821 --> 00:02:14,940
versus him to the battle of the death.
I'm still winning that fight 10 times,

48
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:18,510
10 times out of 10.
So you wish the fight kept going 100%

49
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,670
yeah.
It's a weird way to stop a fight too.

50
00:02:20,671 --> 00:02:24,090
When a guy's not taking damage,
he's just got a leg that's not working

51
00:02:24,091 --> 00:02:24,800
properly.
Well,

52
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,880
and the problem was too,
you know,

53
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,460
he almost,
he basically called timeout and asked

54
00:02:29,461 --> 00:02:31,320
for the doctors to come in.
Once you've done that,

55
00:02:31,321 --> 00:02:32,400
the fight's over,
I think.

56
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:34,720
I think the ref literally thought,
you know,

57
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,210
he should have just called the fight,
right?

58
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:37,980
He shake your leg was broken or
something.

59
00:02:37,981 --> 00:02:39,780
Like what did it,
what was his thought process,

60
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:40,650
I guess?
And then,

61
00:02:40,651 --> 00:02:43,280
and then the doctors came in and then
they started feeling around and they're

62
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:43,841
like,
you know,

63
00:02:43,841 --> 00:02:45,650
they're like right here,
I think is Tibi is fractured.

64
00:02:45,651 --> 00:02:46,540
It's,
I can feel the bone.

65
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:47,310
I'm like,
doc,

66
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,230
I promise you just get out of here.
Let me,

67
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:49,981
there's,
let me fight.

68
00:02:49,981 --> 00:02:50,880
I got to car,
I got an ink,

69
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,440
uh,
a calf cramp or something.

70
00:02:52,441 --> 00:02:53,820
I was like,
you don't just lying to them,

71
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,840
like,
just get out of here.

72
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:55,920
Let me,
let me go.

73
00:02:55,921 --> 00:02:57,690
I promise it's fine.
I don't feel a thing.

74
00:02:57,691 --> 00:02:58,920
It's not hurt.
I'm good.

75
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:02,020
Um,
and then they stopped the fight and they

76
00:03:02,021 --> 00:03:03,880
pulled a stool to pull the stool from me
too.

77
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,140
So remember that.
Oh yeah,

78
00:03:05,141 --> 00:03:06,070
that's right.
Yeah.

79
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:08,920
What was that about?
That was my commissioner that was,

80
00:03:08,921 --> 00:03:11,140
that was New York Athletic Commission at
its best.

81
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:15,310
Like pull the stool and I fell in a,
and then a bunch of people were like,

82
00:03:15,311 --> 00:03:16,940
hey man,
did they call the fight because they

83
00:03:16,941 --> 00:03:18,340
hit,
they thought you couldn't stand.

84
00:03:18,341 --> 00:03:19,290
And I said no,
I,

85
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,900
I hope not because that would have been
very unfortunate cause I fell on

86
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:26,980
national TV.
Got Charlie Brown tie all three stooges.

87
00:03:26,981 --> 00:03:29,070
Molarity curly thanks for nothing doc.
Yeah.

88
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:32,050
Why did he pull a stool?
It was just a mistake.

89
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,610
I think I stood,
I think I stood up,

90
00:03:33,611 --> 00:03:34,001
I was like,
hey,

91
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:36,130
maybe if I get the crowd into it,
maybe these guys would get out of here

92
00:03:36,131 --> 00:03:37,960
and let the fight go.
So I like stood up and I was like,

93
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,430
let's go,
you know,

94
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:41,890
and I'm sitting on the stool and I
freaking looked at him and I was like,

95
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:43,910
you better hope they don't let me off
this toolbox.

96
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,030
I'm going to break your face,
you know?

97
00:03:46,031 --> 00:03:48,270
And then I stand up and then he,
and then the guy pulls a stool.

98
00:03:48,271 --> 00:03:51,280
And then second later I'm on my butt.
Exit.

99
00:03:51,281 --> 00:03:56,281
Scammers run off with 660 million in ICO
earnings.

100
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:58,360
See,
this is like what you were saying about

101
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:03,190
the Nigerian people getting online and
them not knowing certain scams.

102
00:04:03,191 --> 00:04:05,350
And then we get,
it's like scammers find a way in every

103
00:04:05,351 --> 00:04:06,184
system.

104
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:10,920
There's not tons of scams out there.
They're just getting repurposed.

105
00:04:10,921 --> 00:04:12,420
You know,
that just another trick,

106
00:04:12,421 --> 00:04:15,000
they just put a little twist on it
changes the name and it's a new scam,

107
00:04:15,001 --> 00:04:17,220
but it's all the same scams.
I show you my,

108
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,740
you wanted to know my postal scam
postal.

109
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,780
Yeah.
I've actually never done this.

110
00:04:21,781 --> 00:04:24,300
But uh,
it's like where you to get arrested for

111
00:04:24,301 --> 00:04:25,320
what you're about to say.
Well,

112
00:04:25,321 --> 00:04:26,820
I don't know.
I just be careful.

113
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,451
Okay.
Well,

114
00:04:27,451 --> 00:04:32,300
I've never done a pit is strong.
Those mother fuckers come down on you.

115
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:33,870
I've never done it,
but this is something that,

116
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:37,020
uh,
I think somebody told me they used to do

117
00:04:37,021 --> 00:04:38,370
in college.
I don't know.

118
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,780
I don't even know if it really works,
but like I said,

119
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:42,990
like I wanted to send you a letter.
Uh,

120
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:46,050
I would put you as the,
uh,

121
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,570
yeah,
just switch return address and the

122
00:04:48,571 --> 00:04:50,550
sender address.
Throw it in one of those blue mailboxes.

123
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:50,971
Hey,
they'll go,

124
00:04:50,971 --> 00:04:52,740
hey,
no stamp returned to sender.

125
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,360
Now I sent you that letter.
Hmm.

126
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:59,340
Okay.
They'd probably know that one already.

127
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:01,110
Yeah,
they probably do you to do that with

128
00:05:01,111 --> 00:05:02,460
like a letter of they'll probably,
yeah.

129
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,591
Yeah.
They're probably like,

130
00:05:03,591 --> 00:05:05,510
what?
How'd it get all the way over here

131
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:12,190
in the center?
She's dropping off in California and so

132
00:05:12,191 --> 00:05:15,590
we'll speed Ohio the fuck out of here.
They know better.

133
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:17,940
They know better today.
Yeah.

134
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:18,830
They're smarter than you,
Bro.

135
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,820
Famous con artists in history.
Right.

136
00:05:22,821 --> 00:05:26,420
It was like this little tome.
It's smaller than like the smallest

137
00:05:26,421 --> 00:05:30,500
paper back.
And it was the biography of this guy,

138
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:34,940
Victor Lustig was his name.
He was famous because he sold the Eiffel

139
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,120
Tower twice.
All right.

140
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,330
Uh,
and,

141
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:40,330
um,
he,

142
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,290
he had this,
uh,

143
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:45,920
this scam that he called,
I think it was called the,

144
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,350
the,
the Hungarian box.

145
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,350
Um,
I'll have to go back and look,

146
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:55,340
but basically what he would do is he
would get on a boat,

147
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,160
um,
in New York,

148
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:03,140
and he had this sort of beautiful
Mahogany box with a crank on it that had

149
00:06:03,141 --> 00:06:03,974
two holes in it.

150
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:08,660
And he would show all the guests that he
would put a blank piece of paper and one

151
00:06:08,661 --> 00:06:12,440
and turn a crank and a hundred dollar
bill would come out the other end.

152
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:16,730
Uh,
and he convinced them all that it was a

153
00:06:16,731 --> 00:06:19,750
machine that made money and,
uh,

154
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:24,800
everybody would offer him an increasing
amount of money for this invention.

155
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:28,460
Uh,
and he wouldn't sell it until the last

156
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,293
day,
uh,

157
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,440
when he would sell it for,
you know,

158
00:06:30,441 --> 00:06:33,200
40 or $50,000,
and then he would disappear and jump off

159
00:06:33,201 --> 00:06:35,240
the boat and in France and never be seen
again.

160
00:06:35,241 --> 00:06:36,640
People would tear it is,
yeah,

161
00:06:36,641 --> 00:06:38,180
there it is.
What's it called?

162
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:41,690
Wow.
Yeah,

163
00:06:41,691 --> 00:06:42,524
there it is.

164
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:43,860
Um,
but um,

165
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:47,850
but that's exactly what the mortgage,
let me see his face.

166
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:53,750
Look at that fucking creep
lugging them.

167
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,750
Wow.
Let me see that box again.

168
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,980
Wow.
That is crazy.

169
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,191
So they,
yeah,

170
00:07:01,191 --> 00:07:03,460
so it was obviously fake and,
and,

171
00:07:03,461 --> 00:07:05,630
and,
but that's what the mortgage scam was.

172
00:07:05,631 --> 00:07:06,464
They,
they,

173
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:11,180
they were taking basically blank paper,
these,

174
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:16,240
these subprime loans that belonged to
janitors who we're gonna foreclose

175
00:07:16,881 --> 00:07:18,770
within 10 minutes.
All right.

176
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:22,640
And they were telling people that,
oh,

177
00:07:22,641 --> 00:07:25,520
we have this new mathematical process
that allows,

178
00:07:25,521 --> 00:07:27,830
that actually makes this stuff really
safe.

179
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,980
Um,
and you can put it in your,

180
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:34,130
uh,
in your college endowment,

181
00:07:34,131 --> 00:07:37,850
you can put in your pension fund.
And so all of these people,

182
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:40,850
you know,
who his retirement monies were based on

183
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:45,140
security is,
we're buying all this shit that they

184
00:07:45,141 --> 00:07:47,240
thought was,
was aaa aerated.

185
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,860
And that's,
that's how they woke up and you know,

186
00:07:48,861 --> 00:07:51,470
and in 2008,
2009 and they found their,

187
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:54,200
is where we're,
you know,

188
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:56,930
wiped out by 40% or whatever it,
it was.

189
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,700
I mean,
people are losing their minds right now

190
00:07:58,701 --> 00:08:00,550
over the past 24 hours because of Iran.
Right.

191
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,210
And so what you're hearing is you're
hearing a lot of the,

192
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:03,770
um,
the,

193
00:08:03,771 --> 00:08:05,660
uh,
the critics of the current president,

194
00:08:05,661 --> 00:08:09,170
and apparently there are some that are
saying,

195
00:08:09,171 --> 00:08:09,621
oh,
he's,

196
00:08:09,621 --> 00:08:10,101
you know,
he's in,

197
00:08:10,101 --> 00:08:12,560
she goes closer to a military conflict
with Iran.

198
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:16,160
Well these are the same brainiacs.
It said he was entering as closer to war

199
00:08:16,161 --> 00:08:18,770
with North Korea and they,
everybody was completely wrong on that.

200
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:21,080
Uh,
I'm not saying that [inaudible] and the

201
00:08:21,081 --> 00:08:23,240
others in the Iranian regime might not,
you know,

202
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,550
decide to become more bellicose.
But,

203
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,530
um,
I think they're,

204
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,170
I think they're looking at it wrong.
I mean there's this idea that,

205
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:32,210
um,
cause there's a couple of parts.

206
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:33,500
Part one is that they're saying,
oh,

207
00:08:33,501 --> 00:08:34,250
look at what,
you know,

208
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:37,250
he doesn't have a plan b implying that
it's either this deal,

209
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:39,590
which even our European allies say is
inadequate.

210
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:40,970
Right?
Uh,

211
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,180
or it's a military conflict.
And that's kind of what the previous

212
00:08:44,181 --> 00:08:45,680
president was,
was all about.

213
00:08:45,681 --> 00:08:47,780
We either get this deal or we're having
a military conflict.

214
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,360
No,
there's other things in the works.

215
00:08:50,361 --> 00:08:52,880
There's other options in that,
in that decision tree.

216
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,920
Um,
and so I think that's,

217
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,620
that's a false premise.
And the other thing when they talk about

218
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:01,110
it over the past 24 hours anyways,
is that,

219
00:09:01,111 --> 00:09:02,760
well look at this.
This is gonna make it harder to get a

220
00:09:02,761 --> 00:09:04,050
deal with,
with Kim Jong,

221
00:09:04,051 --> 00:09:06,090
none from North Korea.
It's cause he's going to think that we

222
00:09:06,091 --> 00:09:08,190
don't,
we don't support our deals.

223
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:10,530
Well,
I look at it a different way.

224
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,750
I think that Kim Jong Un is going to
look at this and think,

225
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,160
uh,
okay,

226
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,990
they're not going to put up with an
inadequate deal.

227
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,700
Right.
So he's gonna look at it and say,

228
00:09:17,701 --> 00:09:18,370
well,
yeah,

229
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:20,790
that,
because nobody disagrees with the

230
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:21,624
Iranian deal.

231
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,680
They want to talk about.
They want to talk about how it looked.

232
00:09:24,681 --> 00:09:26,670
The Iranians are complying with it.
Well,

233
00:09:26,671 --> 00:09:30,540
the Iranians are complying with what
they agreed to allow him the deal,

234
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,810
right?
Which is none of their military sites,

235
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:38,040
the number of times inspectors who have
actually gotten on and inspected a

236
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:39,840
military site,
including Parchin,

237
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:44,870
the most important military facility in
Iran since that deal was signed in 2015

238
00:09:45,031 --> 00:09:47,820
was zero.
Haven't been there because the Iranians

239
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:52,590
didn't agree to allow any of those sites
in this deal.

240
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,330
So that's like,
that's like saying,

241
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,940
that's like saying if you're a serial
killer,

242
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,980
you'll allow the police to come in and
search your home,

243
00:09:58,981 --> 00:10:00,860
but you can't go in the basement.
Right.

244
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,750
Not that also he called was put their
bodies in the basement,

245
00:10:03,751 --> 00:10:06,780
but I suspect that's the case.
So anyway,

246
00:10:06,781 --> 00:10:08,750
that's,
it's an interesting thing and I,

247
00:10:08,751 --> 00:10:11,450
I guess I wanted to throw that out there
right off the bat because I think Iran

248
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:15,060
right now is consuming so much of the
oxygen for people out there.

249
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:18,540
So people thinking that the reason why
we're backing out of the deals,

250
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:20,520
because the presence being unreasonable
home,

251
00:10:20,521 --> 00:10:23,520
we're forcing what you're just saying.
It's a shit deal.

252
00:10:23,521 --> 00:10:24,780
Period.
Yeah.

253
00:10:24,781 --> 00:10:28,920
I think the idea that we have to stay in
it because it's better than the

254
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:30,830
alternative and the alternative,
you know,

255
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:35,900
being a war is not framing it properly.
I don't think that,

256
00:10:35,971 --> 00:10:40,490
that doesn't make any sense to me,
but I think that the fact that the UK,

257
00:10:40,491 --> 00:10:40,801
the,
the,

258
00:10:40,801 --> 00:10:41,670
the,
the French,

259
00:10:41,671 --> 00:10:45,890
the Germans have all agreed publicly
that it's an inadequate deal.

260
00:10:45,891 --> 00:10:48,240
It needs to be fixed.
That tells you something,

261
00:10:48,241 --> 00:10:52,080
but it also tells you that they have
real strong financial incentives for

262
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,370
continuing to do business in Iran.
They,

263
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:56,400
and as to Russia and China,
frankly,

264
00:10:56,401 --> 00:10:57,360
the other signatories.
